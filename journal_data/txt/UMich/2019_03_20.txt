Before 
“The 
Weinstein 
Effect: Breaking the Stories that 
Spurred a Movement” event 
hosted by the Wallace House, 
The Michigan Daily sat down 
with journalists Ronan Farrow 
and Ken Auletta to discuss their 
roles in reporting on Harvey 
Weinstein and where they see 
the next cultural reckoning 
coming from.
The Michigan Daily: When 
you first started investigating 
Harvey Weinstein, did you ever 
envision the magnitude of the 
cultural reckoning that would 
eventually follow?
Ronan Farrow: I never have 
a completely satisfactory answer 
to this because obviously, I had 
no crystal ball. But for a number 
of the reporters working on 

this story, the threats and 
intimidation — and this was 
of course also directed at the 
sources — ratchet it up to the 
point where you did have to think 
about it all those existential 
terms that were asking about. 
And I wish I could say it was all 
heroic instinct but part of it was 
a pragmatic judgment call that I 
was … I was gambling and it was 
worth getting fired and going 
through all of this because there 
was a chance that it would be a 
huge story. 
Now, what does a huge story 
look like, maybe not this, maybe 
not people in industry after 
industry doing this incredibly 
brave thing?

On 
Tuesday, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Institute 
for 
the 
Humanities, along with the 
Residential 
College 
and 
various other University 
departments, 
hosted 
a 
panel 
discussing 
the 
relationship between crime 
and the environment.
The 
panel, 
titled 
“Humanities 
& 
Environments 
Faculty 
Panel: 
‘Criminal 
Justice 
and 
the 
Built 
Environment’,” 
hosted 
three University professors 

of various disciplines to 
explore their perspectives 
on the environment around 
us 
and 
how 
physical 
and 
social 
structures 
contribute to the criminal 
justice system.
The event began with 
opening 
remarks 
from 
each panelist about their 
respective definitions of 
the “built environment” 
and the role it plays in 
policing and the current 
criminal justice system.
David 
Thacher, 
associate 
professor 
of 
public policy and urban 
planning, 
explained 
the 
role of shared spaces in 

propagating 
ineffective 
tools 
of 
policing, 
such 
as stop and frisk laws, 
specifically 
in 
minority 
communities.
“One 
consequence 
of 
urbanization is that people 
bump up against each other 
a lot more than they did in 
less urban environments,” 
Thacher said. “We create 
shared environments. We 
also have to create rules 
that regulate how we’re 
going to share them. Then 
we have to create tools to 
enforce those rules.”
He also addressed the 
relationship 
between 
urban 
development 
and 

the increased policing of 
personal vices since the 
early 19th century.
“In the Western mining 
towns 
where 
the 
first 
drug laws took shape … 
upwards of two-thirds of 
the population was born 
outside the United States,” 
Thacher said. “They were 
exposed to the influence of 
people with dramatically 
different 
habits 
and 
vices. And perhaps more 
important, their kids were 
exposed to these different 
lifestyles.”

The University of Michigan 
Central 
Student 
Government 
met Tuesday evening to discuss 
a new resolution regarding the 
implementation of a well-being 
fee. The Student Assembly also 
continued debate over a resolution 
to advocate for the revision of the 
cross-examination model of the 
sexual misconduct policy, and Lt. 
Bryan Baker, Division of Public 
Safety and Security liaison to the 
Division of Student Life, spoke to 
the Assembly about unfounded 
reports of an active shooter on 
campus Saturday afternoon.
During a vigil on the Diag 
Saturday afternoon honoring the 
more than 50 killed and 50 injured 
in Friday’s mosque attacks in 
New Zealand, reports of an active 
shooter in Mason Hall surfaced. 
After investigating the situation for 
about three hours, police cleared 
the area and determined there was 
no active threat to the community. 
Baker gave a presentation 
to the Assembly about active 
attacker preparedness and the 
University’s 
emergency 
alert 
system.

On Monday, the Ann Arbor/
Ypsilanti 
Regional 
Chamber 
hosted the 2019 Workforce Pipeline 
Summit to discuss the future 
of the workforce in Michigan. 
The summit had a few hundred 
attendees, and was a day-long 
event with lectures on educational 
inequity and hiring practices. Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer and Raffaele 
Mautone, CIO and vice president 
of Duo Security, presented keynote 
speeches. The event took place at 
Washtenaw Community College in 
the Morris Lawrence Building.
According to Richard Chang, 
CEO of the Ann Arbor company 
NewFoundry, a local software 
developer, and a main organizer of 
the event, the summit was created 
in order to address workforce issues 
that members of the chamber 
encounter.
“Workforce issues are one of 
the 
top 
issues/challenges 
our 
members face and it is our duty as 
an organization to help create a 
solution,” Chang wrote in an email 
to The Daily. “The pipeline summit 
was step one in a series to create 
solutions.”

Investigative journalist Ronan 
Farrow spoke with reporter 
Ken Auletta Tuesday night at 
Rackham Auditorium about the 
impact of the #MeToo movement 

and his role in exposing famed 
Hollywood 
producer 
Harvey 
Weinstein’s history of predatory 
behavior and sexual assault. The 
lecture, entitled “The Weinstein 
Effect: Breaking the Stories 
That 
Spurred 
a 
Movement” 
focused on Farrow’s experience 
reporting 
on 
Weinstein’s 

misconduct and the challenges 
he faced in getting the story to 
print.
Wallace 
House 
at 
the 
University of Michigan hosted 
the lecture, which drew more 
than 600 students, faculty and 
Ann Arbor community members. 
Farrow, a contributing writer to 

The New Yorker, also uncovered 
allegations of sexual misconduct 
against the former head of CBS 
Les 
Moonves, 
former 
New 
York Attorney General Eric 
Schneiderman 
and

Catch, exploit, release


As students gear up for the 
University of Michigan’s Student 
Government elections on March 
27 and 28, The Daily sat down 
with LSA presidential and vice 
presidential candidates to talk 
platforms, vision and plans. In 
this installment, we profile the 
Wang-McKillop ticket. This is the 
first in a series profiling each set of 
candidates for the executive team.
LSA junior Brian Wang, the LSA 
presidential candidate, and LSA 
sophomore Mary McKillop, the 
LSA vice presidential candidate, 
both got involved with LSA 
Student Government during their 

first year on campus. 
Wang said he enjoys helping 
other students understand what 
the University has to offer. He 
credited his inspiration for running 
to 
Pharmacy 
student 
Ibtihal 
Makki, who encouraged Wang to 
run for president last year.
“(Makki) reached out to me last 
year hoping I was going to run for 
president, but I told her I was a 
sophomore,” Wang said. “I was a 
little too young (and) I still wanted 
to get more experience, but this 
year when I was considering to run, 
I definitely reflected back on that 
text … I took it as a compliment. It 
was one of the largest reasons why 
I decided to run.”
When Wang was looking for a 

running mate, he said he wanted to 
find someone who was passionate 
about student government and 
experienced in dealing with a 
variety of situations.
“I think one of the reasons why 
I asked Mary to run with me is 
because I saw her passion for how 
well she connected with other 
students that she was bringing into 
our organization,” Wang said. “I 
really liked the way she handled 
herself, handled the situations that 
came up, addressed the issues that 
our new representatives faced, and 
just overall was a great presence 
and resource for these other 
students and kids who want to get 
involved and came in with, you 
know, open minds and just really 
want to try and understand what 
we’re about.”
McKillop said she enjoys 
asking 
students 
what 
they 
would like to see happen and she 
strives to improve her leadership 
style by asking others what she 
could do better.
“I guess my inspiration to 
run for vice president started 
when I became the chair of 
the appointments committee 
because originally I was only 
the (vice) chair of the Internal 
Review Committee,” McKillop 
said. “When Brian asked me 
to run with him to be vice 
president, I knew that I could 
step up and do it because of 
what I had been doing as the 
chair 
of 
the 
appointments 
committee and also I was just 
really excited to be able to be a 
part of bringing LSA to the next 
level of representing students’ 
interests.”
Wang 
said 
he 
would 
describe his leadership style as 
constructive and democratic.
“I 
think 
most 
of 
my 
experience that I’ve gained for 
the last three years has really 
come from listening to other 

people,” Wang said. “I was a vice 
chair for a few committees for a 
year and a half, and the best way 
I learned and contributed was 
listening to other people and seeing 
what they had to say, because as a 
first-year student, you come in here 
with very little knowledge of how 
the University runs.”
The campaign’s platform is 
broken down into three main 
points: accessibility on campus, 
academics and student life.
On 
the 
accessibility 
point, 
McKillop said the candidates 
hope to implement iClicker and 
calculator rentals for students 
because some students can’t afford 
to buy those materials.
McKillop said the idea of fixed 
tuition rates is also an important 
part 
of 
accessibility. 
Fixed 
tuition is when a student pays the 
same tuition from year to year 
without any increases. Wang 
said implementing this idea will 
make it easier for students to 
attend the University. McKillop 
added that the principle has 
been implemented at George 
Washington University and the 
new tuition would be proposed 
to be the average between 
under 
division 
and 
upper 
division tuition. According to 
the U.S. Census Bureau, average 
household income increased by 
1.8 percent from 2016 to 2017. In 
2018, the University announced 
a 2.9 to 3.9 percent increase in 
tuition for the following year.
“When people come here, they 
don’t know how much they’ll be 
paying in three years,” McKillop 
said. “The average income in the 
United States doesn’t change 
that much from year to year, but 
tuition does … and so it’s very 
much an issue of accessibility 
because people who are of a 
lower socioeconomic status are 
the most affected by an increase 
in tuition.”

THE PINBALL M ACHINE : UX CRUCIBLE

ON THE DAILY: NEIL PATRICK HARRIS NAMES GANDY DANCER AMONG FAVORITES

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: REGENTS GETS GRIM 
MINORITY NEWS

Actor Neil Patrick Harris and his 
husband, David Burtka, a Michigan 
native and professional chef, named 
Ann Arbor’s Gandy Dancer as one 
of their favorite restaurants. The 
actors recently listed their top ten 
favorite restaurants for OpenTable’s 
new feature, Tastemaker lists, which 
allows users to explore the favorite 

restaurants 
of 
frequent 
diners, 
including many celebrities.
Gandy Dancer currently has a 
92 percent recommendation rate on 
OpenTable and almost 4,000 reviews. 
The fine dining restaurant, which 
opened in 1970, is known for its seafood 
and steaks. It is located in downtown 
Ann Arbor, at the intersection between 
Broadway and Depot Street.
The term “gandy dancer” is slang 
that refers to early railroad workers 

in the United States. The restaurant 
sits inside a renovated 19th century 
railway station. According to reviews 
on OpenTable, trains run by the 
restaurant.
“Known in railroading days as 
‘the finest station between Buffalo 
and Chicago,’ the majestic Michigan 
Central Railroad Depot deserves that 
commendation more than ever as the 
Gandy Dancer now,” OpenTable’s 
description of Gandy Dancer reads.

Harris and Burtka also listed Roast 

in downtown Detroit as a favorite 

restaurant, along with a number of other 

eateries scattered across the country. 

Burtka is a University of Michigan 

alum and left his full-time acting career 

to study at Le Cordon Bleu College of 

Culinary Arts in Los Angeles in 2009. 

He currently runs a Los Angeles catering 

company called Gourmet M.D. Harris 

starred in the popular sitcom “How I 

Met Your Mother.”

March 19, 1981
Concerned members of the 
University are preparing to 
battle the persisting problem of 
declining black enrollment as 
the University Regents take a 
look at the minority enrollment 
report today. 
The report shows that black 
enrollment been falling since 
1976 with a record decline

fall of 5.6 percent - the lowest 
figure since the report was first 
compiled in 1972. 
Administrators speculate the 
declining enrollment is caused 
by several factors, many of 
which, they say, the University 
can do little to remedy.
Many black campus leaders, 
however, University must place 
a higher priority on recruiting 

and 
retaining 
minority 
students. And they worry that 
educationally 
disadvantaged 
students will be hard hit by the 
current budget cutting fervor.
Assistant Director of the 
Undergraduate 
Admissions 
Office Lance Erikson said that 
his office
would like to bring more 
prospective minority students 

to see the campus, but that the 
budget
will not allow for it.
And 
assistant 
admissions 
Director Dave Robinson said 
that while the University’s 
many programs are “somewhat 
successful,” the University is 
fighting more than the problem 
of 
contacting 
prospective 
students.

Wang-McKillop look to find ways 
to increase accessiblity on campus 

LSA Student Government candidates plan to implement iClicker rentals

ZAYNA SYED
Daily Staff Reporter 

MICHAL RUPRECHT
Daily Staff Reporter

In their academics point, the 
candidates would like to increase 
transparency in departmental 
grading 
in 
large 
classes. 
McKillop said the coursework in 
classes like Economics 101 can 
be vastly different depending on 
the professor, which can impact 
students’ grades.
In 
addition, 
they 
would 
like to add more details from 
course evaluations to Academic 
Reporting Tools so students can 
get a better understanding of the 
class.
“Once you are mid-class or 
at the end of your class, you get 
reminders repeatedly about filling 
out course evaluations, but most 
of the information is only for the 
benefit of professors and students 
don’t get to see it,” McKillop said. 
“Some of it was released with 
the implementation of ART 2.0, 
which you can find on the Course 
Guide with grade distributions 
and things, but we would like to 
see more of them because there 
are 27 possible questions to be 

asked on the course evaluation 
(and) we’d like to see more of the 
questions released so students 
will be able to better gauge which 
courses fit with their needs.”
In their student life section, 
Wang and McKillop said they 
would 
like 
to 
expand 
the 
recreational 
sports 
waiver 
program for students of lower 
socioeconomic 
status. 
They 
would also like to expand and 
improve CAPS functions.
Wang said there is a shortage 
of CAPS counselors and office 
locations.
“The solution we included in 
our platform was at least working 
with CAPS to provide a more 
informational email and sessions 
to 
increase 
other 
students’ 
knowledge and awareness that 
CAPS is a resource that they can 
use,” Wang said.

TMD: Ken, you have talked 
about your experience with trying 
to break the Weinstein story back 
in 2002 and 2015. What about 
the circumstances in 2017 were 
different from 2002 and 2015 that 
allowed the story to be released?
Ken Auletta: But I think you 
know there’s a tendency to say, 
well because of Cosby, because of 
Roger Ailes, because of O’Reilly 
and others have the culture 
change and therefore continue 
to meddle with ... I think that 
minimizes the work that this guy 
did and the reporters with The 
New York Times did to make 
women feel comfortable enough 
to come out and be brave … My 
hat’s off to the job this guy did.
TMD: What encouraged you to 
stick with the story between 2002 
and 2015?
KA: I thought this guy (Harvey 
Weinstein) was a beast. I thought 
he would do it again, and he did.
TMD: Ronan, do you think 
there are any areas where the 
#MeToo movement has failed? 
There 
have 
been 
criticisms 
saying working class women and 
women of color have not been 
as highlighted. Is the #MeToo 
movement just a reshuffling of 
existing power dynamics?
RF: You know, I wish I could 
take credit for any movement. 
This activism and even the term 
“me too” was around a long time 
before these stories. Tarana Burke 
had been using that term and doing 
grassroots community organizing 
around this for years and years. 
So it’s important to hat tip to 
those people who are really better 
equipped to answer the kind of 
question that you’re asking about 
the movement dimension of it. I’m 
watching from the sidelines as a 
reporter. I have a much narrower 
job which is just digging for the 
facts. I think that by and large, the 
reporting around that movement 
has been really strong from some 
of the major publications. We’re 
seeing almost a renaissance of this 
kind of tackling of sacred cows 
and untouchable subjects through 
investigative journalism. So I’m 
really happy about that facet of it.
TMD: Ken, often, there is 
competition between journalists 
to “break a story” first, but in 
the situation with Weinstein, 
your cooperation with Ronan 
helped expose years of abuse 
and misconduct. When should 
journalists consider themselves 
brothers in arms, and when 
should they see themselves as 
competitors? Can that competition 
be counterproductive?
KA: Well, I think competition 
spurs us to be aggressive, to do 
a better job, but I think one of 
the things — Ronan and I were 
talking about this earlier — one of 
the things that I actually marvel 
at is the generosity between 
The New York Times reporters 
… but they came out a week 
before, they were both working 
on it and he (Ronan) came out, 
and they were different stories 
and yet they both coagulated ... 
Yet, they praised each other. It 
wasn’t about sharp elbows, it was 
about, ‘Good job, good job.’ That’s 
really extraordinary, that kind of 
feeling of joy for his success.
RF: Well, it was a perfect 
storm where The Times broke 
these 
incredibly 
important 
stories about sexual harassment 
and then it really did add a very 
different dimension five days 
later that there were assault 
and rape allegations. I think if it 
flipped either way, the individual 
stories wouldn’t have had the 
same impact. Also, the point of 
breaking these stories requires 
a tank-like mentality for any 
news organization and I think 
it put both The New Yorker and 
The Times in a much stronger 
position. They were both going 
into battle on this quote facing 
down with threats and lawsuits 
and so forth.
TMD: For both of you, where 
is the line between activism and 
journalism? Because sometimes 
it can be tricky to find the line.
KA: Our job is to be an umpire 
and not a participant and to call 
fouls and to expose what we 
think, and if we’re activists, it’s 
hard for us to be credible.
RF: I talked about this a 
lot. You know, my job is not to 
be an activist. I’m incredibly 
inspired by good activism that 
can be prompted by exposing the 
right facts. But I really, I think 
somewhere deep in my bones — 
and I don’t say this as a, you know, 
a self-advertisement — I don’t 
necessarily think it’s a good trait, 
but I just, I get very dispassionate 
when I’m looking at the facts. 

Actually I had a situation in a 
reporting job recently where 
someone who had really viciously, 
a PR person, who had smeared 
a lot of women, sexual assault 
accusers and worked for people 
that I had, you know, personal 
negative history with and was 
it looked like maybe going to 
be a source who would back up 
the account of my stories. And I 
would have given that person a 
hero’s treatment in a heartbeat 
that never even occurred to me, 
and my editor actually said to 
me, “You’re okay with putting 
this person in the story, given 
the horrendous things they’ve 
done?” … I don’t claim to be 
perfect or a robot. I definitely 
have opinions. But when it comes 
to that particular process an art 
form, the emotion does drain out.
TMD: Journalists at all levels 
have exposed sexual misconduct 
on the behalf of people who 
hold a substantial degree of 
power, in executive offices, on 
university campuses and even 
inside newsrooms. It’s something 
we’ve been working to do here 
at The Michigan Daily and the 
University of Michigan. What’s 
your advice to young journalists 
who may be overwhelmed by 
the magnitude of reporting on 
situations like this?
RF: 
There’s 
a 
couple 
of 
things. One is, I’ve now had this 
incredible luxury of being able 
to talk to student reporters all 
around the world, speaking at 
schools like this one, who are so 
passionate about what they do 
and who, in many cases, on many 
campuses, are doing important 
groundbreaking 
reporting. 
That’s one thread of what’s 
gonna carry us through these 
incredibly trying times. Local 
journalism is important and very 
much under threat, you know, 
there’s a lot of questions about 
the sustainability of the business 
model. 
Large 
scale 
media 
organizations, you see a mix of 
incredible, important work that 
really defends our democracy and 
holds the powerful accountable, 
and also media organizations in 
the tank for powerful people and 
doing exactly the wrong thing, 
and covering up wrongdoing. 
So we’re going to need that next 
generation to navigate all of that. 
And so my advice to student 
journalists is to keep going. I 
hope that, you know if anything 
I do ever plays a little part in 
igniting people’s passion for this, 
I am so happy because I can tell 
you, when I was in the thick of 
tough stories, it was people like 
Ken, who were the example that 
kept me going and particularly 
when you stared down a lot of 
those forces of suppression that 
I just mentioned, you need all 
the encouragement you can get. 
If I can replicate that and be for 
others what a lot of reporters I 
respect were for me in my most 
trying times, I hope I can be. And 
I get a lot of emails from student 
reporters, so feel free to reach 
out if you’re dealing with a tough 
story and I probably will have 
absolutely nothing helpful to say 
but I’m happy to try.
KA: 
If 
you’re 
a 
student 
newspaper and you follow this 
guy, you just look at his work, and 
his work will inspire you. You 
say, I gotta do something, or hey 
I wrote about this professor at 
the University. And that’s exactly 
what happened here after this guy 
broke stories in The New Yorker 
and The Times broke their story. 
You’re not going to put that genie 
back in the box. And I think young 
people learn that our job in part 
is to challenge power. To be an 
adversary.
TMD: Given the widespread 
impact 
of 
#MeToo, 
moving 
forward, where do you see the 
next cultural reckoning coming 
from?
KA: I mean you know you 
could just go anywhere … 
clearly, in Washington we talk 
about the conflicts of interest. 
I don’t think we’ve cracked the 
surface of sexual harassment 
and sexual beastly behavior. 
I mean, we can list ... look, 
now the latest one last week 
about admission to colleges. 
And here we are we’re talking 
about people paying off but 
there, there are much deeper 
problems. When I was on the 
board of my daughter’s private 
school, they said we have 39 
openings for kindergarten and 
28 of them for legacy. So, we 
have 11 openings, that’s all you 
have? When you talk about two 
classes and unequal treatment, 
boy oh boy, that’s just right 
there.

Chang believes the main 
takeaway of the summit is to 
support 
local 
communities 
through hiring practices.
“If I can only choose one, 
I’d go with: look local, build 
local, hire local,” Chang wrote. 
“Invest in our community for 
long term economic viability 
and sustainability.”
Whitmer spoke about the 
state budget and prioritizing 
infrastructure issues such as 
the roads, education and clean 
water. Whitmer also addressed 
her proposal for an increase 
of the gas tax and remedial 
measures in the plan that seek 
to compensate the working 
poor and senior citizens.
“No one wants to raise the 
gas tax,” Whitmer said. “I 
don’t enjoy putting the solution 
on the table, but it is about 
time that we have serious 
conversation about where we 
are headed as a state and what 
it’s going to take to fix these 
problems. Fifteen cent gas tax 
increase this fall, going up 
another 15 cents six months 
later, and 15 cents after that, 
actually puts us in a position to 

solve all of the problems that I 
just went over.”
Mautone 
spoke 
about 
his 
personal 
journey 
from 
graduating 
from 
college 
at 
Eastern Michigan University, 
to working as a waiter in 
Austin, Texas, to getting hired 
and trained by Dell. According 
to Mautone, Dell recruited 
young 
people 
who 
worked 
in the service industry that 
developed good communication 
and problem-solving skills and 
fit well into the company’s 
culture.
Mautone said his experience 
taught him local companies 
should reconsider what they 
look for when hiring employees. 
He cautioned this mindset must 
also apply to management.
“I want you to take a chance 
and change jobs,” Mautone 
said. “That is what we did at 
Duo, that is why Rich asked me 
to be here. We started looking 
through a different lens, and 
with that, we were able to find 
local talent. So you might be 
saying to yourself, Raffaele, I 
believe in that. But does your 
management 
team? 
Because 
see that’s where I started 
looking next. I was saying 
to everyone, we’re going to 

find interns, we’re going to 
transform individuals that are 
in the industry or not in this 
industry, but want to be in tech, 
want to be in IT, want to be in 
cybersecurity, and let’s enable 
them. But if you don’t have the 
right infrastructure or mindset 
within your organization, even 
in the next layer within your 
management team, it won’t 
work. And I found that out 
fairly quickly.”
Ida Abdalkhani, the founder 
and president of Ability to 
Engage, 
a 
marketing 
and 
consumer research company, 
said one of the reasons she 
attended the summit was to 
learn how to best engage the 
community and hire locally. 
Abdalkhani said this has been 
difficult to do.
“I wanted to learn more, 
myself being an entrepreneur, 
and needing to find hires — 
it’s been incredibly difficult 
to find people in Ann Arbor, 
the majority of people that I 
work with are actually outside 
of Michigan, and so it’s a topic 
that I’m interested in to learn 
about,” Abdalkhani said. “How 
can I, as someone who’s looking 
for people in the state and in 
Ann Arbor, think differently 

about how to approach the 
topic?”
LSA senior Zach Tingley 
attended the summit with the 
University’s Poverty Solutions 
organization. Tingley said the 
summit made him aware of 
how managers’ hiring practices 
affect 
the 
makeup 
of 
the 
workforce.
“I never really think about 
managerial practices and things 
of that nature,” Tingley said. “I 
thought it was really interesting 
listening to these new hiring 
practices that he was talking 
about. 
I 
really 
appreciated 
being very conscious of the way 
that company’s hiring practices 
affect the workforce and affect 
access to the workforce, and I 
think I learned a lot from that 
actually.”
Tingley said he appreciated 
the speakers’ focus on skills 
that 
cannot 
necessarily 
be 
found on a resume.
“I 
really 
appreciate 
the 
approach 
they’re 
taking 
with 
recognizing 
people’s 
disadvantages and recognize 
their abilities in their purest 
forms that aren’t necessarily 
on their resume, but really 
growing with people,” Tingley 
said.

Farrow won a Pulitzer Prize 
for his reporting on Weinstein, an 
award he shared with Jodi Kantor 
and Megan Twohey of The New 
York Times.
Farrow said while he had seen a 
shift in society and the way people 
responded to reports of sexual 
misconduct when he first wrote 
about Weinstein in October 2017, 
there were still power imbalances 
obstructing accountability.
“I think we have a long way to 
go,” Farrow said. “I don’t think 
we’ve achieved accountability, I 
don’t think we have in the media 
fully come to grips with the extent 
to which we were failing to the 
hold the powerful accountable and 
contributed to a cover-up culture. 
I don’t think we’ve extended 
the 
tentative 
steps 
towards 
accountability to all of the segments 
of society that desperately need it. 
It is still very much a set of stories 
that has been dominated by affluent 
people, white people, people with 
a public profile. All of that needs to 
change.”
Daily reporters Sammy Sussman, 
Music, Theatre & Dance sophomore, 
and Nisa Khan, Information senior, 
introduced Farrow, discussing how 
his work influenced their own. 
Sussman documented 40 years 
of misconduct allegations against 
Music, Theatre & Dance professor 
Stephen Shipps. Khan and LSA 
junior Maya Goldman, The Daily’s 
editor in chief, followed a University 
student 
through 
the 
difficult 
process of reporting a sexual assault 
to the administration.
Farrow began the conversation 
by crediting the women willing to 
go on the record for the success of 
the story and the cultural reckoning 
that followed.
“It’s important to point out what 
the sources in those stories were 

living through was exponentially 
more difficult than anything I dealt 
with as a reporter,” Farrow said. “I 
wasn’t reliving the intense personal 
trauma. I didn’t have to grapple 
with the extra dimension of not only 
might my career fall apart, but also 
I’m going to be staring down this 
very specific kind of stigma that 
sexual violence carries.”
Auletta first tried to report on 
allegations against Weinstein in 
2002 but struggled to get sources to 
go on the record. He was working on 
a profile of Weinstein for The New 
Yorker, and when he confronted 
him with allegations of rape, Auletta 
said Weinstein was enraged.
“I failed to get names,” Auletta 
said. “When I confronted Harvey 
Weinstein at the time, Harvey said 
they were consensual affairs. We 
had to decide at The New Yorker, 
are we the National Inquirer, are 
we going publish anonymous versus 
him publicly saying it didn’t happen? 
And we didn’t publish it.”
According to Auletta, Weinstein’s 
behavior was an open secret in the 
industry and for many years, rumors 
about 
him 
circulated. 
Auletta 
congratulated Farrow on being able 
to publish allegations against him. 
Farrow said previous survivors 
of sexual assault who had come 
forward with allegations against 
powerful men like Bill Cosby and 
Roger Ailes made his reporting 
possible and thanked the women 
who spoke to him for his article.
“Although I couldn’t tell those 
sources as they were doing this 
incredibly brave thing that they 
would be heard, that there would 
be a version of the universe that we 
would all live in a year later where 
people would care about their 
stories and the stories would matter 
and there would be accountability 
because of them,” Farrow said. 
“But I could say for the first time in 
recent history, hey, there are some 
slivers of precedent here that are 

promising.” 
LSA 
sophomore 
Sophie 
Underwood said Farrow’s lecture 
interested 
her 
because 
she 
eventually wants to go into the film 
and TV industry.
“Media plays a big role in society 
and in uncovering these sorts 
of events that would have just 
remained hidden because of the 
major power that certain people 
have in the industry and how they 
abuse that power, and I think that 
journalism is one of those ways 
to check that abuse of power,” 
Underwood said.
During a Q&A session, American 
Culture lecturer Emily Lawsin 
asked Farrow about the University’s 
track record on handling sexual 
assault cases, citing a 2015 survey 
which found prevalent instances 
of misconduct among students. 
Farrow said college campuses 
were among the many segments of 
society that needed to confront the 
manner in which they responded to 
claims of sexual violence.
“There are a lot of spaces that need 
serious reforms to create a safe space 
for people who should never have to 
be survivors of sexual violence again 
but too often are,” Farrow said. “In 
terms of the specific intricacies of 
Title IX offices on this campus and 
others, those systems are broken. I 
have not reported on the University 
of Michigan specifically, but across 
the country, they are broken. The 
striking thing is that both accusers 
and accused often walk away from 
Title IX processes on campus 
feeling that the process was unjust, 
that there wasn’t a fair hearing of 
facts.”
One of the audience members 
criticized Farrow for encouraging 
“McCarthyesque” 
tactics 
and 
undermining due process. Farrow 
began to address the comment, 
but the audience member left 
immediately 
after 
voicing 
his 
complaint.

“You should see my Twitter 
mentions,” Farrow said. “That’s 
tame.”
Farrow also touched on the 
politicization of sexual misconduct 
claims, 
a 
criticism 
heavily 
associated with allegations made 
against Kavanaugh during his 
Supreme 
Court 
confirmation 
hearing before the U.S. Senate in 
the fall. Professor Christine Blasey 
Ford said Kavanaugh tried to rape 
her when they were teenagers and 
Deborah Ramirez, who attended 
Yale University with Kavanaugh, 
accused him of sexual misconduct. 
Farrow and his colleague at The 
New Yorker broke news of Ramirez’s 
allegations in September.
Whether 
or 
not 
someone 
thought the allegations were true 
depended largely on political 
affiliation, with a majority of 
Democrats believing Ford and a 
majority of Republicans believing 
Kavanaugh. 
Farrow 
said 
he 
approached allegations of sexual 
assault based on the merits of 
the claims, not who was making 
them.
“Everything gets thrust into this 
cauldron of partisan mistrust, and 
what’s saddening about that is it’s 
fundamentally antithetical to what 
we do as investigative reporters,” 
Farrow said. “If the evidence is 
there, I’ll do a body of reporting 
about anyone of any persuasion … 
There is such a shrinking space for 
that kind of approach and for any 
kind of understanding that anyone 
might genuinely have that approach. 
There’s this assumption that you just 
must be on our side or the other side 
and this crushing disappointment 
when it proves out that you’re not on 
anyone’s side.”
Farrow said he hoped the 
assumption of politically motivated 
journalism would abate.
“I hate partisanship, and I hope 
fact-based reporting is the antidote 
for it,” Farrow said. 

He began his presentation by 
reading from Saturday’s official 
University statement on the 
situation, as well as an excerpt 
from DPSS Executive Director 
Eddie 
Washington’s 
official 
statement on March 17.
“The news of a shooter 
on campus was a terrifying 
and traumatic experience for 
members of our community — 
both for people near Mason Hall 
when the reports were coming in 
as well as anyone who received 
the alert from afar,” Washington 
wrote in the statement. “After a 
thorough search of Angell and 
Mason Halls, officers were able 
to confirm the reports were 
related to balloons popping in 
the area, which sounded like 
shots being fired. Even though 
this was a false alarm, we are 
grateful for members of our 
community who made the call to 
police to report it.”
Baker 
shared 
DPSS’ 
and 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services’ contact information 
and explained how students, 
parents 
and 
community 
members can register their 
cell phone numbers through 
Wolverine Access to receive 
emergency alerts. Alerts are 
offered through a text message, 

phone call or both, and the 
person registering their number 
chooses the way they wish to be 
notified.
“I read a few statements and 
I heard things, students saying, 
‘I didn’t get any type of alert,’” 
Baker said. “That’s telling me 
those students, if they haven’t 
registered for emergency alerts, 
need to make sure that they 
are. We do know that there 
were 
some 
communication 
issues in terms of how the alerts 
were sent out due to cell phone 
towers and their capacities over 
the weekend.”
Emergency alerts are also 
available through the Michigan 
app and the new version of 
the DPSS app, Baker said. He 
encouraged Assembly members to 
sign up for both text message and 
phone call notifications through 
Wolverine Access in addition to 
downloading both apps.
Baker 
continued 
his 
presentation by addressing the 
University’s protocol in the event 
of an emergency. He emphasized 
the need to use the “run, hide, 
fight” protocol implemented by 
DPSS in regards to situations 
involving an active attacker.
“It’s 
not 
necessarily 
hide 
and then run and then fight,” 
Baker said. “It is run or hide or 
fight. Again, you have to make 
that determination of what that 

means … If there’s a threat that’s 
immediately present to you, it’s 
up to you to determine what your 
response is going to be.”
Baker said investigation of 
Saturday’s events remains ongoing 
and the University and DPSS are 
looking into the delay in alerts to 
the campus community.
“The University and DPSS, 
we’ve 
already 
transitioned 
our gears into active action 
and figuring out what exactly 
happened, what happened with 
communication, what happened 
with 
responses,” 
Baker 
said. 
“We’re working on really getting 
the best of that.”
After 
Baker’s 
presentation, 
members 
voiced 
concerns 
regarding how Saturday’s situation 
was handled. LSA fifth year Cece 
Huddleston asked Baker about 
the delay of alerts from DPSS. 
Although Huddleston was not 
near Mason Hall at the time, she 
said she was very disappointed in 
the way the situation was notified 
to students across campus.
“I wouldn’t be a good LSA rep 
if I didn’t let you know that pretty 
much everybody in my community 
was 
very 
disappointed,” 
Huddleston said. “We heard in 
our group chat between 4:00 and 
4:15 about an active shooter being 
on campus, but I just looked up the 
first tweet from DPSS was at 5:04 
... Being so close to campus and not 

knowing what’s going on is very 
scary.”
Huddleston also questioned 
whether the balloon popping that 
caused reports of an active shooter 
were a malicious act. She said 
as a member of a marginalized 
community, she along with others 
in the community thought the 
balloon popping occurring during 
a vigil for the New Zealand victims 
seemed almost too convenient.
Baker said he is not directly 
involved in the investigation. 
He answered Huddleston by 
explaining that he has not heard of 
any malicious intent.
“From what I understand, the 
investigation is still ongoing,” 
Baker said. “From what I’ve been 
told, there was no malicious intent. 
I know that might differ from the 
perception of the community, but 
that’s all I can share right now.”
In 
addition 
to 
Baker’s 
presentation, 
CSG 
President 
Daniel Greene, Public Policy 
senior, along with LSA senior 
Rafik Issa and LSA senior Edward 
Samir Haraka, presented a new 
resolution 
encouraging 
the 
implementation of a well-being 
fee. If passed, the resolution would 
add a $19.33 well-being fee to 
student tuition to expand mental 
health services and attempt to 
improve overall well-being on 
campus.

Meanwhile, 
the 

humanitarian 
crisis 
in 

Venezuela continues. Citizens 
still face food shortages and 
power 
outages. 
This 
has 

drawn the attention of the 
international 
community, 

with aid from across the 
world flowing to the borders. 
The U.S., along with the a 
large part of the international 
community, 
backs 
Guaidó 

as the current Venezuelan 
president, which has added 
another political dimension 
to the crisis. This tension 
has also been exacerbated 
by the long and turbulent 
past between the U.S. and 
Venezuela, with Maduro even 
refusing to accept U.S. aid as 
a result. Ultimately, however, 
the most pressing aspect of 
the crisis is the miserable 
shortage of basic goods and 
freedoms 
the 
Venezuelan 

people have endured. At this 
point, inaction is tantamount 
to complicity; the U.S. has a 
responsibility to address the 
crisis. By collaborating with 
regional 
and 
international 

actors, 
the 
U.S. 
can 
help 

establish a truly free and fair 
presidential 
re-election 
as 

soon as possible and thereby 
minimize the possibility of 
further Venezuelan suffering.

The most important and 

pressing fact is that the people 
of Venezuela are currently 
fighting for survival. Citizens 
lack basic access to food and 
medical services and are facing 
a national blackout. The U.S. 
ought to continue to do what 
it can as an economic and 
political power to provide aid 
to the Venezuelans. We at The 
Daily feel it is important that 
this aid be distributed for the 
sole purpose of humanitarian 
assistance and not as a tool 
in 
disrupting 
Maduro 
or 

furthering domestic political 
agendas. 
Recently, 
Trump 

has erroneously blamed the 
current dismal conditions of 
Venezuela on socialism, rather 
than resource dependency and 
economic 
mismanagement. 

This 
only 
worsens 
the 

politicization of the problem. 
Furthermore, 
Venezuelans 

are being denied aid due their 
country’s turbulent political 
history with the U.S., so any 
sense that American aid is 
simply 
cover 
for 
political 

interference 
could 
lead 
to 

continued denial of aid for 
Venezuelans. Approaching the 
immediate problem at hand 
will take cooperation on both 
sides to ensure the quickest 
and most efficient resolution 
possible.

This 
also 
means 
that 

Maduro will need to step up 
and put his own politics aside 
in order to help the people 
of his country. Maduro often 
invokes the idea of “patria,” 
or fatherland, to justify his 
rule. If this is truly the case, he 
ought to do whatever it takes 
to provide Venezuela’s citizens 
with the most basic needs of 
food, medicine and basic living 
standards. As we have stressed 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
U.S. 

government, the Venezuelan 
government — including both 
Maduro and the opposition 
— should put aside political 
agendas in order to ensure the 
livelihoods of its citizens.

Beyond 
the 
immediate 

humanitarian issue, however, 
it 
is 
increasingly 
evident 

that the root of Venezuela’s 
problems is intertwined with 
a 
violent 
political 
history. 

The international community 
must tread carefully in the 
fashion by which it provides 
aid 
and/or 
intervenes 
in 

Venezuela. We encourage the 
United States to reflect on 
its complicated relationship 
and past involvement in Latin 
America, and caution against 
military 
or 
imperialistic 

intervention. To go in and 
determine the presidency by 
force would be an excessive 
overreach of the United States’ 
position, and would likely fuel 
Maduro and his supporters’ 
view of the U.S. as a nefarious 
agent bent on political control. 
Instead, we suggest further 
collaboration 
between 
the 

U.S. 
and 
the 
international 

community, specifically with 
Latin 
American 
coalitions 

that have a larger stake in 
finding a resolution, so that 
free democracy and peace can 
eventually be reached through 
fair and uninhibited elections.

The future in Venezuela is 

undoubtedly ambiguous, and 
we cannot predict the fates of 
Maduro or his opposition. What 
is absolutely clear, however, 
is the immediate suffering of 
everyday Venezuelans who lack 
basic resources and necessities; 
they have weathered enough 
human 
rights 
abuses 
to 

justify 
reasonably-restrained 

involvement and aid in their 
country. To the extent that 
their suffering has been cruelly 
exacerbated by political unrest, 
it can also be remedied by 
political solutions. We hope that 
the U.S. can take a benevolent 
role in this project and help 
establish true democracy in 
Venezuela that caters to the 
needs of Venezuelans first.

“Gossip 

Girl”-worthy college scam 
recently revealed by the 

FBI has incensed people across the 
United States, with college students 
and their parents in particular 
expressing the most outrage. The 
scam was possible because of 
William “Rick” Singer, who helped 
parents fake their children’s test 
scores, 
recruitment 
in 
college 

athletic teams, and even their races 
and ethnicities to be accepted into 
prestigious universities such as the 
University of Southern California 
and various Ivy League schools. He 
collected over $25 million for his 
efforts, and his clientele included 
notable celebrities Felicity Huffman 
and Lori Loughlin.

Loughlin’s 
daughter 
Olivia 

Giannulli, better known as Olivia 
Jade, was accepted to USC after 
her parents paid $500,000 for 
their two daughters to be admitted 
as crew recruits, complete with 
staged photos of the girls on 
rowing machines. As a social 
media influencer with 1.9 million 
subscribers on YouTube, 1.4 million 
followers on Instagram and various 
partnerships with brands such as 
TRESemmé and Sephora — which 
have since ended — Giannulli has 
received perhaps the most backlash 
on social media. Her entire brand 
was built around an “I’m rich but 
still down to earth” image, which 
was completely shattered by her 
involvement in the scam. Giannulli 
has also said in a video that was 
uploaded before she began her 
freshman year, “I don’t really care 
about school.” She later apologized 
for her statements in a follow-up 
video. Her words have been the 
subject of many news reports in the 
wake of the admissions controversy, 
and many people are angered that 
someone who apparently does not 
even care about her education was 
able to use her privilege to attend a 
school over rejected students who 
work hard and do care about their 
education.

Many students who grew up 

watching “Full House” bemoan 
Loughlin’s 
involvement 
in 
the 

scheme (“I’m so sad, I love ‘Aunt 
Becky,’” my friend told me when 
she heard the news), and Giannulli’s 
subscribers openly mocked the star 
through comments on her social 
media before she disabled them. 
Since the scandal first came to 
light, TMZ reported that Giannulli 
and her sister have dropped out of 

college because “the family feels 
certain, if the girls went back to USC, 
they would be ‘viciously bullied.’”

As a college student, it of course 

upsets me that students such as 
Giannulli bought their way into 
prestigious schools when there are 
so many students who apply to these 
schools with true credentials and 
get rejected, or receive admission 
but cannot attend due to expensive 
tuition. Yet, I am almost more 
irritated that Giannulli and her 
sister gave up their spots at USC so 
easily due to a fear of being “viciously 
bullied,” if TMZ’s source is correct. 
Their ability to drop out of college 
so easily showcases their privilege 
more than their ability to scam 
their way into it in the first place. 
It has never been a secret that rich 
white folks use their money to earn 
their children places at top colleges, 
whether it be by making donations 
to the school or leveraging personal 
and business connections. Singer’s 
clients have simply been performing 
the same tradition, just in a much 
more illegal way. While this doesn’t 
excuse their actions by any means, it 
makes them less shocking.

So many students, particularly 

students of color, face both outright 
and covert bullying in schools that 
invalidate their right to be there even 
when they do not scam their way 
in. Such bullying dates back to the 
landmark Supreme Court decision 
Brown v. Board of Education, in 
which 
school 
segregation 
was 

outlawed. The Little Rock Nine, a 
group of nine Black students who 
enrolled at a previously all-white 
school in Arkansas to test the court 
decision, had to be escorted in by 
federal troops. Even today, many 
people attribute the admission 
of students of color in colleges to 
affirmative action rather than their 
academic achievements. We have 
all heard the argument that the only 
reason students got into a university 
is because they are Black or another 
underrepresented 
race. 
These 

students who have their intelligence 
constantly undermined are exactly 
the kinds of students defended by 
critics of parents involved in the 
scam: Students who work honestly 
and tirelessly for the chance to earn 
admission to a school, knowing that 
if they don’t get accepted, there’s 
nothing they can do, and that if they 
do get accepted, they need to work 
even harder than they did before.

These students don’t have the 

luxury of quitting school because 

of a fear of bullying that they will 
almost inevitably face as people 
of color at an institution of higher 
education. Students whose parents 
can afford to pay bribes to send 
them to college don’t have to worry 
about earning enough money post-
graduation to make a living. Perhaps 
these students don’t necessarily 
receive the kind of blatant backlash 
that 
Giannulli 
has 
received. 

However, these students have the 
burden of knowing that they can’t 
make mistakes, because any that 
they do make will perpetuate racial 
stereotypes that already undermine 
their presence at their school. They 
do not have the privilege of buying 
their way into school, and they do 
not have the privilege of making 
mistakes. They do not have the 
privilege of dropping out after 
funneling so much of their hard-
earned resources into obtaining an 
education.

I do believe that the Giannullis 

made the right choice in dropping 
out. Yet, I wish that the reason 
they did it was because they felt 
remorse about the situation, rather 
than because they were afraid 
of being bullied. From the harsh 
backlash they have received, it’s 
understandable 
that 
they 
feel 

scared and mortified. But their 
willingness to give up their spots 
at USC without even fighting for 
them, despite their willingness to 
be a part of an incredibly illegal 
scheme to be admitted in the first 
place, further undermines the 
efforts of students who endure 
hardships for the chance to receive 
an education.

To all parents out there: If your 

children don’t get admitted to the 
college of their dreams, enroll 
them in another school where they 
earned admission, and encourage 
them 
to 
submit 
a 
transfer 

application for the following year or 
semester. If you have enough money 
to bribe college admissions to admit 
your child, instead use that money 
to hire tutors for your children so 
that they can maintain a high GPA 
so as not to risk commemorating 
their college years with a criminal 
record. Bribery may seem like 
a perfectly acceptable course of 
action in “Gossip Girl.” In this case, 
however, do not let life imitate art.

KRYSTAL HUR | COLUMN

I 

love ghosts. I love ghost tours, 
paranormal 
investigation 

shows, rumors and stories of 

hauntings, attributing something 
falling off my shelf to a ghostly 
presence; I love it all. To be 
perfectly clear, I’m not talking 
about horror. I have enormous 
respect for the horror genre and 
its cultural significance, but I 
do not derive the same thrill 
and enjoyment from consuming 
horror media that die-hard fans 
do.

But ghosts? I absolutely adore 

ghosts. I’m endlessly fascinated 
by them, and it seems I’m not the 
only one: 45 percent of Americans 
believe in ghosts, and 18 percent 
of Americans say they’ve seen a 
ghost.

What I think draws me to 

ghost stories so much is the 
storytelling aspect of it all. 
The occult combines with the 
historical combines with gossip 
and rumors to create a lore — 
a 
hyper-specific 
geographic 

mythology in which the dead 
still walk with us. For relatively 
young country, the United States 
is positively littered with ghosts.

In nearly every city and town 

across America, you can hear 
stories about local hauntings 
and lore, from Puritans hung for 
witchcraft in New England to 
aspiring starlets found chopped 
into 
pieces 
in 
Los 
Angeles. 

Specters seem to linger in both 
the grandeur of old mansions 
and in the dust and destitution of 
abandoned mines; in the echoing 
halls of plantation houses and in 
the fields. Whether you believe 
in ghosts or not, we can piece 
together a history from ghost 
stories alone, a history that reveals 
both what we love and fear the 
most.

There is, perhaps, no time 

in American history more filled 
with phantoms than the years 
immediately following the Civil 
War. The death toll was massive, 
with Union and Confederate 
forces 
suffering 
somewhere 

between 650,000 to 850,000 
deaths combined. That’s about 2 
to 2.7 percent of the population, 
more deaths of U.S. soldiers than 
any in other conflict and nearly 
half of the total number of U.S. 
soldiers lost in all wars combined. 
How does a nation grieve this 
massive loss? How do the millions 
of loved ones left behind reconcile 
the deaths of parents, spouses and 
children?

Whether the ghosts were 

the product of an overactive 
imagination, intense grief and 
a desire to communicate with a 
loved one just one more time, or the 
actual spirits of the dead roaming 
the Earth, it seemed that no one 
could escape ghosts in America 
in the 20 or so years following 
the Civil War. Ghosts supposedly 
even followed Sarah Winchester 
all the way to San Jose, where 
she built her large and bizarre 
estate. Her husband, William, 
was the owner of the Winchester 
Repeating Arms Company, the 
manufacturer of the gun rumored 
to have claimed the most lives 
over the course of the war. When 
he died of tuberculosis and their 
infant child passed too, Sarah took 
her inheritance and moved west, 
where she began construction of 
her massive, labyrinthine home.

The story goes that Sarah had 

consulted a psychic, who told her 
that death was following her as a 
result of all the lives her husband’s 
guns had taken. Once she started 
building her home, she could not 
stop. She had to keep building — even 
adding partial floors and hallways 
that didn’t go anywhere — in order to 
appease the spirits that haunted her.

Sarah is just one story, but it 

seems that many postbellum ghost 
stories involve women. Countless 
sisters, daughters and widows of 
the hundreds of thousands dead 
during the war seem to have stories 
of their loved ones reaching out 
to them from beyond the grave. 
Sometimes, however, these women 
were desperate enough to reach out 
to the dead themselves.

Originating in 1848, but rapidly 

gaining popularity through the ante 
and postbellum eras, the Spiritualist 
movement in America signaled to 
a new form of spirituality. It was a 
movement that rejected the mores 
of organized Christianity and the 
idea of a go-between God, instead 
claiming that its followers could 
communicate directly with the 
dead. In Spiritualism, there was no 
heaven and hell and no God — just 
a judgement-free afterlife that all 
could access.

Spiritualists held seances and 

ceremonies in which they reached 
out to the dead, who responded 
with knocks and walls and tables 
and levitating objects, along with 
other 
seemingly 
unexplainable 

phenomena. 
One 
prominent 

Spiritualist and self-styled “spirit 
photographer,” William Mumler, 
even claimed that he could capture 
the spirit of a deceased loved one 
on photograph. His clientele was 
diverse, 
including 
Mary 
Todd 

Lincoln among others.

Many prominent Spiritualists, 

however, were women. The original 
practitioners from upstate New 
York were the Fox sisters: 15-year-
old Margaret and 12-year-old Kate. 
Spiritualism differed from other 
organized religions in that, well, it 
wasn’t really very organized. Were 
there a clergy, however, the majority 
of its ordained members would be 
women. These women were also 
involved with other causes, such 
as abolition in the antebellum, civil 
rights in the postbellum and the 
movement for women’s suffrage, 
among other things. As time passed 
and these movements, already 
controversial, 
fell 
further 
into 

disfavor, more and more Spiritualists 
were brought on trial for fraud. 
Strides were made in the field of 
parapsychology, and by 1920, the 
movement all but ceased to exist.

FROM THE DAILY

Venezuela deserves democracy
O

n Feb. 18, President Donald Trump issued a statement to Venezuela’s 
military: abandon its support for current Venezuelan President 
Nicolás Maduro — or else. The president warned at a speech at 

Florida International University that if the military continues to support 
Maduro, they will “lose everything.” While this ultimatum is vague by 
nature, it brings up concerns about how far the U.S. is willing to go to in 
order to oust Maduro as president and let Juan Guaidó, Maduro’s U.S.-
backed challenger, assume power until a new election can be held. Guaidó 
claims the recent election that re-elected Maduro was fraudulent, and has 
since proclaimed himself the interim president until fair elections can be 
held — a point the legislature supports and Maduro dismisses.

In 1973, a man purchased 
a can of gasoline from the 
Walgreens in the French Quarter 
of New Orleans. In an act that 
he would never be indicted for, 
he proceeded to “the Upstairs,” 
a New Orleanian gay bar, where 
he used the fluid to ignite the 
stairwell of the bar, a passage 
already 
conducive 
to 
flame, 
trapping many patrons inside. In 
a span of minutes, the Upstairs 
fire spread. The fire would 
ultimately claim 33 lives.
While 
dozens 
lost 
lovers, 
family, income and security, and 
as the community scrambled 
to understand the implications 
of 
the 
fire, 
response 
from 
government and police officials 
was dampened. Media reported 
on the event in unusual scarcity. 
The attack on the Upstairs 
Lounge threatened to slip into 
oblivion. LSA alumni Robert 
Fieseler, however, is determined 
to stop that from happening. I had 
the opportunity to speak with 
him about his recent research 
on the Upstairs Lounge fire that 
culminated in his first book, 
“Tinderbox,” 
recently 
named 
a finalist for The Randy Shilts 
Award — a conversation that 

proved amiable and educational. 
Fieseler is rightfully confident 
in his understanding of the 
event. His passion is refined and 
prominent. He is as articulate in 
speaking as he is on paper.
“I look for the cracks in 
the concrete that I can fall 
down,” 
says 
Robert 
Fieseler 
on the writing and research of 
“Tinderbox,” which details the 
1973 calamity. “Where it seems 
like something that’s solid in 
our society but actually doesn’t 
make any sense.” He’s talking 
about the cleavages in history 
that get smoothed over too 
quickly, events like the Upstairs 
Lounge fire that, while slighted 
for many years, act as something 
of a juncture, invisibly shaping 
the course of today. It’s these 
invisible histories — perhaps 
call them icebergs, with most 
of the story unseen beneath the 
water from a traditional view — 
that Fieseler looks for when he 
researches. “Tinderbox” is the 
product of the discovery of one of 
these quiet but salient fractures: 
the Upstairs Lounge fire.
“Tinderbox” tells the story of 
the Upstairs Lounge brilliantly, 
researched and presented in 
a fashion that remains both 
remarkably 
professional 
but 
intimate. 
Fieseler’s 
account 
reaches beyond solely the events 

of June 1973 and allows readers 
surveys of both the events 
leading up to the fire as well as its 
long-reaching consequences. The 
work provides well-researched 
evidence, filling between the 
bricks with careful investigations 

of those involved in the incident, 
relying sometimes on dutiful 
descriptions 
and 
literary 
imagery.
Fieseler spoke to me about the 
precariousness of writing about 
tragedy. He nodded to the fragile 
responsibility that accompanied 
both his descriptive writing 
of the 1973 events and the 
presentation 
of 
uncontested 
essentials. Everything he wrote, 
from the color of walls to the 

countenance of victims, had to be 
traceable back to a source. “It was 
maddening,” Fieseler says. “It 
creates a level of accountability.” 
The 
balance 
of 
character 
investigations 
and 
textbook 
facts that make “Tinderbox” so 

compelling also made Fieseler’s 
research all the more important. 
There was the need to be 
honest and fair to the victims 
and the city of the time, he 
explained, something he felt was 
impossible to contribute without 
entrenching readers into the 
lives of patrons and witnesses. It 
is this investigation that makes 
“Tinderbox” so evocative.
And so, research was both 
consuming 
and 
impactful. 

Fieseler spent time in archives 
around the country to stack his 
nearly seventy pages of citations 
on the event, though it was 
mostly his conversations with 
those who had lived through the 
fire that he spoke to me about. 
These talks were difficult but 
necessary. “Individuals sensed 
that although it would be painful 
to rehash and, to a certain 
extent, relive a lot of these events 
… that there would be some 
broader purpose,” he says of the 
interviews he conducted. “There 
were a couple conversations with 
people that were some of the 
greatest moments of my life and 
that I would never take back.” 
Conversations happened both in 
and far from New Orleans, one 
even taking place in a jazz club. 
Fieseler decided to directly quote 
these interviews in “Tinderbox,” 
and they are certainly successful. 
The first-hand accounts from fire 
survivors scattered through the 
work make the event all the more 
real for readers.
When 
asked 
about 
the 
politicizing of the fire, Fieseler 
said that he doesn’t believe it’s 
possible to separate the event 
from the politics of the time. “It’s 
woven into the fabric,” he says. 
He pointed to the people affected 
and the lack of a response from 
leaders and community members 

that only worsened the scenario, 
leaving victims without funerals, 
families without income and 
thousands 
who 
refused 
to 
even 
acknowledge 
the 
term 
“homosexuality” when reporting 
on the event. “People forget 
the era of criminalization (of 
homosexuality),” Fieseler says, 
“and what criminalization meant 
… for the victims and how people 
suffered mentally.”
At the end of our conversation, 
I 
directed 
the 
dialogue 
to 
Fieseler’s 
experience 
at 
the 
University. He openly recounted 
his struggle as a gay college 
student in a time of remarkably 
low 
visibility, 
nodding 
to 
coverage of the queer community 
by The Daily in helping him come 
out. “I hope that we live in a 
day and age where people aren’t 
struggling [with their sexuality] 
in college,” Fieseler told me. 
“Coming out is a great thing. I 
mean, do it while you’re young 
and cute, please,” he laughed. 
In a later and more thoughtful 
note, he nodded to the weight 
of the story “Tinderbox” tells, 
one far more important than 
any one individual. It is a horror 
that events such as the Upstairs 
Lounge ever occurred. And it is 
the research and passion of those 
like Fieseler that ensure it will 
never happen again.

Queer history: In conversation with Robert Fieseler

BOOK REVIEW

Going 
into 
The 
Brian 
Jonestown Massacre, I had no 
idea what to expect. Coming out 
of it, I have no idea what to think. 
I had never heard of The Brian 
Jonestown 
Massacre 
before, 
and 
after 
listening to a 
few of their 
past releases, 
it 
was 
hard 
to get a firm 
grasp on the 
band’s sound. 
Their 
most 
recent release 
is no different. 
The 
album 
has so many 
influences 
that it’s hard 
to 
determine 
exactly 
what 
the 
album 
sounds 
like. 
It’s not quite 
a 
modern 
version 
of 
classic 
rock, 
it’s not quite 
psychedelic, 
it’s not quite 
post-rock, it’s 
not quite neo-
folk, it’s not 
quite garage rock and it’s not 
quite shoegaze. Somehow, The 
Brian Jonestown Massacre is a 
menagerie of all these genres and 
many more, and when it works, it 
really works.
A quick glance at the Spotify 
page for The Brian Jonestown 
Massacre will reveal that the 
self-titled album is their 18th 
full-length release. The band has 
as many singles and EPs as they 
have albums. The band releases 
a staggering amount of music, 
but based on this most recent 
release, the band’s prolificity is 
not a hindrance whatsoever.

The 
Brian 
Jonestown 
Massacre’s 
driving 
opener 
“Drained” proves to be an 
ambitious song to follow. It 
starts the entire album off on 
the right foot. “Drained” sounds 
like it could be the grittier, less 
grandiose little brother to some 
of the most popular Britpop 

songs of the late ’90s and early 
’00s. It’s bluesy and fluid, and 
overall, it’s so much fun to hear.
The rest of the album struggles 
to match the highs of “Drained,” 
especially toward the back end. 
However, other standouts include 
the haunting “Tombes Oubliées” 
and the bluesy rocker “Cannot 
Be Saved.” Unfortunately, both 
of these songs are found early 
in the tracklist, which actually 
hurts the album. Placing three 
of the best songs in the first four 
slots of the album is decidedly 
not a good decision. It leaves the 
band playing catch up for the rest 

of the work, reusing the elements 
that made the album’s highs so 
great.
With this in mind, it is easy 
to see why The Brian Jonestown 
Massacre begins to skid. Despite 
its varied influences and multiple 
sonic motifs, The Brian Jonestown 
Massacre 
becomes 
a 
little 
monotonous 
as it runs. The 
reverb-soaked 
guitars 
and 
vocals 
begin 
to 
sounds 
washed 
out, and the 
grooves begin 
to be recycled. 
The 
song 
“Remember 
Me This” is 
especially 
guilty. 
As 
one 
of 
the 
later 
songs 
on the album, 
“Remember 
Me 
This” 
needs to bring 
something 
new 
to 
the 
table, 
but 
instead 
it 
festers in the 
same sounds 
that 
have 
already been 
used and abused throughout the 
album.
The album is by no means 
perfect, but it surely does not 
disappoint. The Brian Jonestown 
Massacre wasn’t made in an 
attempt to attract new fans. 
Rather, it was made for the 
band’s faithful fans that will end 
up walking away from this album 
content. The album seems like 
an unwarranted victory lap for 
The Brian Jonestown Massacre, 
who could, if driven to it, most 
certainly craft a consistently 
great album instead of just a few 
noteworthy songs.

A confusing release from
The Brian Jonestown M.

Daily Arts Writer

My mother taught me to 
read. She taught me to read 
long before pre-school and long 
before someone else could teach 
me first. She wanted to be the 
one to bless me with the gift of 
stories, so we spent all of my 
childhood reading together. My 
now overgrown personal library 
started from a chest of books in 
the basement of my childhood 
home, 
and 
a 
small 
white 
bookshelf set against the wall in 
my childhood bedroom. When I 
was young and small, reaching 
into the chest meant reaching 
into another world, where pages 
could ignite the wildest parts of 
my mind with dreams of far off 
places. Maybe she knew that I’d 
be so inclined to telling stories 
— to knowing them, to holding 
and nurturing them, years and 
books and pages later, when 
I’ve become all tangled up in 
everybody else’s wordy limbs in 
attempts to untangle my own. 
She took me to the library to get 
my first library card, a tradition 
I’ve matched as I move to new 
cities 
and 
experience 
new 
places, and would sit on a plush 
cushion chair as I browsed 
for a few hours, indulging my 
curiosity for books. She gave me 
stories and with that, perhaps 
as collateral or perhaps because 
she truly intended to, she gave 
me imagination. She let me 
write stories and read them 
out loud at the dinner table, 
where I was the strong, female 
protagonist, so that when I was 
met with hundreds of stories 
with strong male characters, 
and a singular troupe-y female 
ingenue, they felt foreign and 
forced. 
Maybe 
she 
doesn’t 
realize this, but perhaps I am 
so inclined to make believe 
because she gave me the tools to 
fall in love with art.
My mother taught me to 
run. She instilled in me a fierce 
competitiveness even when I 
was the weakest athlete on the 
team, a willingness to believe 
that anyone no matter how 
unathletic, could be a runner. 
All 
it 
takes 
is 
supportive 
sneakers and the road, and 
you could fall in love on your 
way down the dusty trail and 
never return to where you 
began. Running is not without 
defeat, but the best days are 
always accompanied with the 
knowledge that for me, the road 
always listens. I was ten years 
old when I started running at 
Meadowridge Park with my 
mother, and I’ve probably run 
a total of 10,000 miles. It is a 
love affair — Meadowridge 
Park, Hoka sneakers and I, that 
will never grow stale. At first it 

felt as though she was making 
me run, and I dreaded every 
middle school cross country 
practice and the runs her and 
I would take on the weekends. 
But she was right in teaching 
me to run. My mother did not 
make me a runner, but she gave 
me the tools to begin. Running 
and I are an unlikely pair, as I 
like to think I am unabashedly 
artistic and unathletic, and 
runners are meditative and 
strong. But my body craves the 
movement — running is my 
moving meditation, the way I 
settle an unsteady heart, the 
way I clear my cluttered mind. 
I’ve run five half marathons 
and one full marathon, with her 
unwavering support, because 
she gave me love for the pain 
and the goodness in the familiar 
motions.
My 
mother 
taught 
me 
gratitude. For no one thing 
in particular, but for my life. 
She taught me to count my 
blessings and know that I have 
many of them — even when I 
struggle to recognize it. She 
puts 
momentous 
downfalls 
and eye level tragedies to rest 
when she reminds me that 
things can always be worse. 
She taught me this when she 
curbed my anxiety surrounding 
flying on airplanes, when she 
didn’t sugarcoat the difficult 
moments in life to teach me 
about reality and truth, no 
matter how ugly those can be. 
She taught me to be thankful 
for my body, regardless of how 
frustrating 
it’s 
peculiarities 
and complications, because at 
the end of the day it is a healthy 
body. It is a strong body. It is a 
beautiful body. One that has 
given me so many gifts — one 
capable of so many miracles 
and with so many flaws that are 
mine to love.
My 
mother 
taught 
me 
strength, which is a life lesson 
you cannot learn from a book 
or a classroom, or even a simple 
conversation. Sometimes it takes 
a monumental understanding 
to climb life’s most troubling 
challenges. When she fell ill my 
sophomore year of high school 
and battled debilitating vertigo 
and imbalance, she managed to 
continue to serve as a central 
beacon of support continually 
effusing energy and strength, 
even when I knew she had none 
left to give. If she was bedridden 
for an entire week, she’d find 
a way to muster up courage 
and shaky toughness to come 
support a cross country race, 
school musical or honors society 
induction. She would be in the 
hospital just days before my 
first Thanksgiving in college, 
but conjure up the energy to 
smile and be completely present 
for me as we sat around the 

family room couch to eat dinner 
with her. When she was finally 
diagnosed with late stage Lyme 
Disease and the incurable, not 
fatal, yet all the while crippling 
Ménière’s disease, I recognized 
that a mother’s job is never on 
break or vacation. Because even 
when her body was attacking 
her mercilessly, she put positive 
energy out into the world, and 
used every ounce of herself 
to put my brothers and I first, 
circumstances aside. Her first 
priority is never and would 
never be herself. Perhaps this 
is a part of motherhood, or 
perhaps this is just part of her. 
She once told me that her 
purpose in life was to raise my 
brothers and I, and now that 
we’ve grown up, she’s okay 
with not having a purpose 
as demanding anymore. She 
doesn’t work a nine to five job, 
and since being diagnosed with 
an unpredictable autoimmune 
disease it’s more difficult for her 
to pick up intensely demanding 
jobs or responsibilities. But I 
disagree with her sense that 
her purpose has become less 
of a demand, or that her job is 
lighter now. Your purpose and 
role as a mother only grows 
more 
demanding 
as 
your 
children find their footing, grow 
old enough to shake naivetes 
and truly see the world. My 
mother has an uncommon and 
salient purpose as a healer. She 
heals people with words and 
actions. In another life she may 
have been a therapist — she 
has a medicinal way of curing 
the deepest of wounds and 
reconciling concerns, whether 
grave or trivial. Maybe she’s 
just some sort of a saint. Her 
advice is therapeutic — realistic 
and honest, yet soft and careful. 
She will constantly tell you that 
she is inarticulate or not as 
intelligent as she could be, but 
on this, she is wrong. She always 
has the right words in the most 
natural way, in her mind she 
has every answer. It’s not just 
me who sees this ability to 
remedy. She is an unbelievable, 
altruistic friend, saving the 
people she loves when they need 
saving, telling them the truth 
when they need reality. She is 
an extraordinary sister and I’ve 
watched her give her sisters 
the epitome of female love, be 
it as small as fashion advice 
to as monumental as pieces of 
herself. Whenever anyone in 
her life needs her words, her 
shoulder, her eyes, they give her 
a call. I am surprised her phone 
ever stops ringing, and try my 
best to wonder about her when 
I call too.

NOW.

In 
today’s 
tumultuous 
political climate, there aren’t 
many things we can agree 
on. We may not agree on the 
ideal thermostat temperature 
(72 degrees) or how much 
milk to put in your cereal (40 
milliliters) or who is the best 
Coppola (Jason Schwartzman), 
but what we can all agree on 
is that we love John Mulaney. 
Find me someone who doesn’t 
adore this dimpled comedy 
star, I dare you. We love John 
Mulaney because he is:
A) Hilarious in a non-
threatening way.
B) Kind of hot, also in a non-
threatening way.
Here’s a fun game, walk 
into the UgLi (it gets better, I 
promise) and count how many 
John Mulaney meme laptop 
stickers you find. The fun 
part of the game is that you’ll 
find a lot. One time I was in 
The Michigan League and 
overheard not one, not two, 
but 
THREE 
conversations 
about how much they all loved 
John Mulaney. This anecdote 
is to prove that:
A) Everyone loves John 
Mulaney.
B) 
I 
am 
skilled 
at 
eavesdropping.
We love John Mulaney for 
pointing out his neuroses and 
tearing himself apart for our 
entertainment and pleasure. 
His 
observational 
humor 
makes us shout at the TV, 
“that happens all the time,” 
or “he gets me.” His standup 
perfectly combines tales from 
his childhood and his SNL 
days with a healthy heaping of 
self-deprecation. His stories of 
growing up make you think he 
was raised in suburban Illinois 
in the ’50s and not suburban 
Illinois in the late ’80s. Maybe 
he is a time traveler or an 
ageless wizard, which would 

explain why your parents like 
him too. There is no other 
explanation: John Mulaney 
must be a timeless wizard of 
comedy, bending time and 
space to make us laugh.
John Mulaney is the friend 
you bring home to meet your 

parents because parents love 
him. He is the guy who holds 
the door for people on the 
subway. He’s the guy who asks 
what floor when you get in an 
elevator with him. He is the 
friend who is a grandpa, but 
also down for anything. He 
is usually in bed by nine, but 
he’ll egg your ex’s house if you 
ask him to. He is the guy who 
has an extremely complicated 
order, but when the waitress 
brings him a different meal, he 
says nothing and pretends to 
enjoy it. He is the friend who 
kills it at trivia because he 
knows a lot of fun facts from 
being an unathletic kid and 
probably spent too much time 
at the Scholastic book fair. We 
love John Mulaney because 
he’s just so damn loveable.
But John Mulaney is so 
much more than his Emmy-
winning stand up. We mustn’t 
forget his work for six seasons 
as a writer on Saturday Night 
Live. Usually writing alongside 

Simon 
Rich 
and 
Marika 
Sawyer, 
Mulaney 
thrived 
on 
the 
program 
creating 
such 
iconic 
characters 
as 
Stefon and Herb Welch (both 
played by my future husband 
Bill 
Hader). 
Mulaney 
has 
returned to Studio 8H twice 
to host the show, resurrecting 
sketches 
killed 
from 
back 
in his writing days in the 
form of Diner Lobster and 
Bodgea Bathroom. Mulaney 
also dazzled on Broadway 
(pronounced Broadway with 
an emphasis on the way) with 
his college improv buddy, Nick 
Kroll, in “Oh Hello.” Look how 
much college improv can help 
your career (@mom). Kroll 
also utilizes his buddy in his 
Netflix show “Big Mouth” 
to portray the awkwardness 
of Andrew Glouberman, the 
lightly mustached Jewish boy 
going through puberty, a role 
Mulaney was born to play. 
Mulaney’s recognizable voice 
was also featured in the form 
of Spider Ham / Peter Porker 
in the all-time best movie, the 
Oscar-winning 
“Spiderman 
into the Spiderverse.” You 
can also find Mulaney on Bill 
Hader and Fred Armisen’s IFC 
show, “Documentary Now.” He 
co-wrote (alongside SNL alum 
Seth Meyers) and starred in 
the Sondheim-inspired third 
episode of the new season.
Mulaney’s comedy is simply 
genius and it makes me equal 
parts delighted, jealous and 
vermouth. Listening to his 
routine is like a symphony, 
with Mulaney acting as the 
comedic 
conductor. 
Each 
movement is timed perfectly 
to the beats of laughter and 
weaved together at the end in 
a crescendo of callbacks. God, 
I love John Mulaney, you love 
John Mulaney, we all freaking 
love John Mulaney!

Wonder Kid: Why we love
John Mulaney as a person

DAILY HUMOR COLUMN

BECKY 
PORTMAN

I am always shaken by the 
courage of memoir. First, in 
the act of reopening those 
creaky doors, reentering those 
old rooms, going back through 
the old files and boxes which 
somehow contain our lives, 
and trying to make sense of 
what was there. Then, in the 
act of arranging these intimate 
exhibits 
and 
memory-laden 
objects on the page, on the 
screen 
for 
others 
to 
behold. 
These 
actions 
require courage I have yet 
to find.
But others do have 
that 
courage, 
and 
in 
abundance. I’m thinking 
of 
Trevor 
Jimenez, 
director 
of 
Oscar-
nominated 
short 
film 
“Weekends.” In the short, 
Jimenez rearranges his 
early-life 
experience 
of 
a 
fractured 
family 
in the story of three 
characters: a mother and 
father, 
newly 
divorced 
from one another, and 
a young boy who splits his 
time between the two, staying 
with his mom during the week 
and his father on weekends. 
What 
is 
important 
about 
Jimenez’s representation of 
this experience is that the 
young boy is not in the middle 
of his parents’ divorce; he is 
at the center. Shots are angled 
to privilege his vantage point. 
His dreams and nightmares 
of his parents’ reunion occupy 
space. He is the nexus of all 
the courage I was talking 
about, and everything Jimenez 
does with the film honors and 
centers around this strong 
little boy.
“Weekends” is hand-drawn 
and 
shaky, 
like 
a 
child’s 
sketches. The titles appear 
in embellished handwriting, 
wobbly but with ample serifs 
to make up for it. Its animation 
style reminded me warmly 

of the way I used to write the 
title of the stories I penned 
in elementary school. The 
animation will do that to 
you: it will make you walk 
backwards until you can see 
things the way you did when 
you were young. In turn, you 
will see the strength required 
to occupy that position, amid 
all the competing allegiances 
and loves and desires.
“Weekends” is also silent 
film. No character verbalizes 
what they are feeling. Instead 
of reinventing dialogue or 

putting words into people’s 
mouths, 
Jimenez 
makes 
brilliant use of other sounds 
to retell the tale, perhaps with 
the purpose of maintaining 
quiet 
reverence 
for 
the 
strength of the boy. One of 
the most brilliant, alternative 
uses of sound in “Weekends” 
is the devotion of musical 
themes to each parent: Erik 
Satie’s compositions for the 
mother, 
and 
Dire 
Straits’s 
“Money for Nothing” for the 
father. When I saw the boy’s 
father turn the volume up on 
the radio in response to the 
opening riff, I quickly coupled 
that image with footage of 
my own memories, of my 
father’s own perfunctory turn 
of the volume dial whenever 
he would happen upon that 
same Dire Straits song. The 
songs in this film will do that 
to you: send you searching for 

your own parents’ anthems. 
They will transport you to 
your own scenes of listening 
to your parents’ songs and 
trying to make sense of these 
complex human beings from a 
complicated angle.
“Weekends” is rife with 
symbolism. A certain courage 
lies in the use of symbolism, 
especially when it involves 
excavating 
artifacts 
from 
memory, 
putting 
these 
intimate objects on display, and 
telling a story, perhaps a new 
or revised story, through them. 
While 
these 
symbols 
take multiple forms — 
anywhere from a raccoon 
to a horse figurine — I 
want to talk about a 
symbolic 
act 
Jimenez 
portrays: 
the 
act 
of 
blowing out a fire. In an 
early scene, the mother 
leaves a pot unattended 
and the smoke alarm goes 
off; while she tries to fan 
the smoke away, her son 
blows at the alarm, in a 
heartrending display of 
care and of doing the best 
with what little power 
children 
have. 
Then, 
in one of the most stunning 
sequences of the film, the boy 
has a nightmare in which the 
top half of his mother’s new 
boyfriend’s head is replaced 
with a single candle which he 
tries to blow out, only for the 
fire to spread and engulf his 
house. This symbolic action 
will do that to you: it will 
make 
you 
experience 
that 
helplessness. It will make you 
think about impossible wishes, 
the fear when we realize 
they are impossible, and the 
strength it takes to imagine 
new ones.
“Weekends” 
will 
do 
all 
of this to you, and more. It 
will show you the courage of 
memoir, and perhaps even 
share with you some of its 
own bravery and inspire you 
to reopen those doors, reopen 
those boxes, make sense of it 
all.

On courage in ‘Weekends’

FILM REVIEW

It’s 2019 and, unfortunately, 
when you Google “late night 
television show hosts,” only 
three notable hosts stray from 
the classic formula of straight, 
white men — Trevor Noah, 
Samantha Bee and Busy Phillips. 
Simultaneously, 
Hollywood 
audiences 
have 
been 
pushing 
for 
more 
representation 
and 
diversity 
in movies, with 
films like “Crazy 
Rich Asians” and 
“Captain Marvel” 
finally 
bringing 
Hollywood 
closer to a new, 
more interesting 
horizon.
Despite 
the calls for a 
more 
accurate 
reflection 
of 
our 
world 
in 
movies, 
late 
night talk shows 
have 
remained 
surprisingly 
untouched. 
Although 
it’s 
frustrating 
that while casts, writers and 
production staffs are becoming 
ever more varied, the kinds of 
people interviewing them are 
remaining stagnant, NBC’s most 
recent announcement hopes to 
challenge this frustration.
On 
“The 
Tonight 
Show 
Starring 
Jimmy 
Fallon” 
on 
Mar. 14, YouTube personality 
Lilly 
Singh 
announced 
her 
newest project: “A Little Late 
with Lilly Singh.” Her choice 
of entertainment, comedy, is 
a male-dominated profession 
and her success in the field 
is indicative of the fact that 
people are becoming tired of 
the same kind of person telling 
the same kind of jokes. Some of 
her more popular YouTube bits 
involve her dressing up as her 

Indian parents, delivering jokes 
that many second-generation 
immigrants can relate to.
“A Little Late” marks a 
significant change in late night 
television: Singh will be the 
first woman to host her own 
show on one of the “Big Four” 
television networks.
Not 
only 
does 
Singh 
represent women of color, but 

she is also a shining light for the 
LGBTQ+ community. She came 
out as bisexual in the month 
preceding her announcement 
and it only added to the value 
of her new show. However, 
her appeal doesn’t just come 
from her diverse background. 
If 
anything, 
those 
details 
are 
a 
fringe 
benefit 
when 
considering her talents as a 
comedic 
personality. 
Singh 
has cultivated a following of 14 
million subscribers on YouTube 
and consistently puts out high-
quality content, like her yearly 
“Twelve Days of Christmas” 
series in which she works 
with prominent celebrities to 
create holiday skits. Adding 
Singh to their line-up of shows 
demonstrates 
the 
network’s 
understanding 
of 
what 

audiences want and how to give 
it to them.
Her ascendance to network 
TV also shows the influence 
that YouTube has had in recent 
years and the pressure it has 
put on companies like NBC to 
re-evaluate where they stand 
on the diversity front. More 
than ever people are turning 
to 
online 
communities 
like 
YouTube, 
where 
they 
can 
tailor 
their subscription 
boxes so that they 
are 
entertained 
by someone who 
looks like them, 
without having to 
hope the opinions 
of a network head 
coincide 
with 
what a specific 
audience member 
is 
looking 
for. 
With 
Singh 
making a debut 
appearance on a 
major 
television 
network, 
it’s 
hard not to think 
about the impact 
YouTube had on 
her 
career 
and 
the criticism that 
many YouTubers 
receive for being 
“fake” celebrities.
It’s not surprising then, that 
NBC was the network to take the 
leap. The company hosts a slew 
of shows that meet the diversity 
demands 
of 
its 
customers, 
including 
Andy 
Samberg’s 
popular 
“Brooklyn 
Nine-
Nine” which boasts a bisexual 
and Latina detective, a Black 
captain and a man comfortable 
in his masculinity. The company 
provides a reprieve from the 
constant barrage of white men 
on our screens.
Singh represents the changes 
in Hollywood that are necessary 
to keeping the diversity train 
rolling 
– 
without 
diverse 
people in powerful positions, 
Hollywood may be doomed to 
a 
white, 
testosterone-laden, 
future.

‘A Little Late’ is just in time

For ‘M,’ second bid means progress

The year was 2006.
In the midst of her fourth 
season as head coach of the St. 
John’s women’s basketball team, 
Kim Barnes Arico reached her 
first NCAA Tournament. She was 
thrilled just to be there.
The team headed to State 
College, Pa., for the first weekend 
of the tournament. Connecticut 
and its coach, Geno Auriemma, 
were there, too. At that point, 
Auriemma 
already 
had 
five 
championships under his belt. He 
would be named to the Basketball 
Hall of Fame later that year.
Though the two teams never 
faced each other that postseason, 
the coaches still crossed paths 
while in the city.
“I said to him, ‘You know, I’m so 
happy to be here,’ ” Barnes Arico 
told Inside Michigan Basketball 
Radio Show. “And he goes, ‘The 
easiest part is getting there. The 
hard part is staying there.’ ”
Back then, Barnes Arico didn’t 
fixate too much on Auriemma’s 
comments — she simply enjoyed 
the weekend and appreciated the 
work it took to get there. After 
all, Barnes Arico’s achievement 

marked a successful turnaround. 
The team hadn’t been to the 
tournament since 1988, and the 
season prior to her arrival, the Red 
Storm finished with an abysmal 
3-24 record, losing all of their 
conference games.
But now in her seventh season 
at the helm of the Michigan 
women’s basketball team (21-11 
overall, 11-7 Big Ten), Barnes Arico 
can contextualize Auriemma’s 
sentiment. 
On 
Monday, 
the 
Wolverines got a tournament bid 
for the second straight year — but 
it hasn’t always been that way.
“Here I am 10, 12 years later, 
15 years later, saying, ‘Oh my 
goodness. To stay there is really, 
really incredible,’ ” Barnes Arico 
said. “For our kids to be able to 
do what they’ve done the last 
few years is just a credit to them 
and what they’ve meant to our 
program and what they’ve brought 
to our program.”
This 
realization 
comes 
by 
looking at the program’s history. 
The team still holds a below 
.500 record of 605-698, and this 
season marks just the eighth time 
the Wolverines have made the 
tournament. They have yet to 
make it out of the second round.
Barnes 
Arico 
knows 
the 

difficulty in taking a team to the 
tournament year after year. She 
brought Michigan to the big stage 
in her first season as head coach, 
then missed out the following four 
times. That fourth season, the 
Wolverines finished third in the 
Big Ten and had 22 wins going into 
the Selection Show, but still didn’t 
make it.
Thus, receiving a bid for the 
second straight season is quite 
significant for the program as a 
whole. There’s still a ways left to 
go, but it shows valuable progress.
And 
Barnes 
Arico 
makes 
sure her team doesn’t take it for 
granted — that they recognize the 
team’s roots.
“Yeah, they’re kind of getting 
spoiled,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said 
jokingly. “But we talk to them a 
lot about the past. It’s important 
to realize where our program was 
and where our program is now 
and where our program wants 
to be. And I think as coaches, we 
emphasize that a lot and we talk 
about that a lot.
“ … The players and the coaches 
that came before, they know really 
what it took to get to where we 
are now. And step-by-step, brick-
by-brick to build this, and to build 
really a program and not a team.”

Wolverines defeat Western, 12-6

In 
the 
Michigan 
baseball 
team’s second midweek game of 
the season on Tuesday, it hoped 
to avoid the same pitching follies 
against Western Michigan that it 
had in the first.
Initially, it wasn’t obvious if it 
could.
Sophomore right-hander Blake 
Beers had his second start of the 
season — in his first, he cruised 
through until the third inning 
before he began to struggle. A 
feeling of déjà vu spread through 
the stadium as he did so again.
After making a great play to 
snag a ground ball for the first out, 
Beers proceeded to walk a batter, 
allow a double and an RBI single 
before he hit Bronco Blake Dunn 
in the head to load the bases in his 
last act. 
Freshman left-hander Walker 
Cleveland 
came 
in, 
limiting 
Western Michigan to just two 
more runs after a single and a walk.
Despite the follies of the third 
inning, Michigan (14-4) trumped 
Western Michigan (6-13) 12-5, 
behind an explosive offense.
The 
Wolverines’ 
offensive 
onslaught began in the bottom of 
the first inning. Three walks by 
Broncos pitcher Jack Szott loaded 

the bases, bringing an early visit 
to the mound by manager Billy 
Gernon to instill confidence in the 
pitcher.
Szott got his control back for 
senior infielder Blake Nelson, 
working his way back to a 2-2 
count before inducing a ground 
ball to third base, only to watch the 
ball bounce over his third baseman 
Jimmy Roche’s glove. Two runs 
scored on the error and Michigan 
had an early lead.
The lead was snuffed out when 
Beers let in three runs in the third.
The Wolverines, though, would 
not stay down. In the bottom of 
the third, they recaptured the lead 
with a well-timed hit-and-run 
that put both runners in a perfect 
position to go up 4-3 on Nelson’s 
single to left field.
From there on out, it was all 
Michigan. 
Cleveland 
clamped 
down 
on 
Western 
Michigan, 
ending the day with his first 
collegiate win and only one hit 
allowed.
“He’s only thrown a third of an 
inning all year and he came in and 
settled the game down for us,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. “The 
game was very much in question 
and I thought he did a great job of 
coming in and putting up zeros to 
let our offense separate and put the 
game in the bag for us.”

Added Cleveland: “The team 
played really well today. They had 
my back the whole way, the batters 
put in a ton of quality bats together 
and swing to put us out ahead.”
Despite his humility, Cleveland 
was all smiles. As soon as the 
interview was over, he quickly 
shuffled back into the locker room 
to text his parents the good news.
The offense had a field day — in 
the fourth inning, junior infielder 
Jordan Brewer launched a two-
run home run over the tall brick 
wall in left field to extend the lead 
to 6-3.
A 45-minute bottom of the sixth 
inning put the game firmly out of 
hand after the Wolverines scored 
five runs and go up 12-3, allowing 
Bakich to start putting in reserves.
“Playing time is one of those 
things that’s you’re fair but not 
equal,” Bakich said. “It’s great 
when you can get a wide margin 
in a game like that where everyone 
can get an opportunity or everyone 
can get an opportunity to get some 
reps. And those are precious, those 
are valuable, because not every 
game is like that.”
With a dominant offensive 
display and competent pitching, 
the last game of the five-game 
home stand ended up being no 
different than the games that 
preceded it.

Meghan Beaubien stymies Broncos in 3-0 win

For the second time in the last 
week, Faith Canfield used her 
leadoff at-bat to jump on a pitch 
over the heart of the plate. And 
for the second time in the last 
week, the senior second baseman 
clubbed the ball over the Alumni 
Field fence.
The home run was all the No. 
25 Michigan softball team needed 
to defeat in-state foe Western 
Michigan (7-12), 3-0.
Just two days removed from 
recording a pair of wins and a 
save in last weekend’s sweep 
of Kent State, sophomore left-
hander Meghan Beaubien picked 
up right where she left off. The 
reigning Big Ten Pitcher of the 
Year was locked in from the start, 
retiring the first two Broncos 
with emphatic punchouts and 
surrendering only one hit in the 
first four innings.
When the Wolverines (16-10) 
tacked on a pair of fifth-inning 
insurance runs, Beaubien didn’t 
even need them. She kept the 
Broncos off the scoreboard all 
afternoon, tallying a season-
high 13 strikeouts along the way. 
Beaubien finished with a four-hit 
shutout in her ninth complete 
game 
of 
the 
season.
“(Beaubien) 
is 
throwing with a 
clear mind,” said 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins. 
“She’s 
throwing 
with 
conviction. 
Her speed is up, 
her changeup is 
on. It’s tough to 
be 
clear-minded 
when you’re a young kid, so part 
of it is a learning curve.”
When 
junior 
right 
fielder 
Haley Hoogenraad stepped up to 
the plate with the bases loaded 
and two outs, she had the chance 
to give Michigan a sizable early 
cushion. Hoogenraad dug into 
the batter’s box, let her bat rest on 
her shoulder and crouched into a 
formidable batting stance.
Unlike Canfield, who worked 
a full count before unleashing a 
big cut, Hoogenraad took a swing 

at the first offering she saw from 
Broncos’ starting pitcher Reily 
Galloway. The barrel of her bat 
wound up in front of the offspeed 
pitch, resulting in a soft ground 
ball down the third base line.
Despite putting four runners 
on base in their first crack at 
Galloway, the Wolverines only 
mustered one run from the threat. 
For returning players, the team’s 
failure to pull away brought back 
memories 
of 
last 
season’s 
shortcomings 
against Western 
Michigan.
Last 
May, 
the 
Broncos 
played 
spoiler 
when they made 
a 
late-season 
trip 
to 
Ann 
Arbor. 
Despite 
having 15 fewer 
victories than the Wolverines, 
Western 
Michigan 
amassed 
13 hits en route to an 8-2 win 
— its first against Michigan 
since 2012. The loss put a dent 
in the Wolverines’ postseason 
momentum.
This season, sophomore left-
hander Meghan Beaubien made 
sure it wouldn’t happen again.
Since her ERA reached a 
career-high 3.95 in a Feb. 22 loss 
to Stanford, Beaubien’s mark has 
gradually 
trended 
downward 

towards her 1.16 clip from a season 
ago. After Tuesday’s dominant 
showing, Beaubien will enter this 
weekend’s 
conference-opening 
slate with an ERA of 1.99.
“I think from the start of the 
year to now, my mental process 
has gotten a lot better,” Beaubien 
said. “Lately, I feel like it’s 
been really good, like this past 
weekend and today. For the most 
part, I have to forget last year 
and 
understand 
that 
it 
doesn’t 
matter and this is 
a completely new 
year. I just need 
to work hard and 
do my best and be 
what I can be this 
year to the best of 
my ability.”
After 
Canfield’s home 
run, 
Michigan’s 
offense remained dormant until 
the bottom of the fifth inning, 
when junior catcher Abby Skvarce 
made a pinch-hit appearance. 
With 
sophomore 
shortstop 
Natalia Rodriguez perched on 
second base after swiping her 
seventh bag of the season, Skvarce 
laced a ground ball under the glove 
of Western Michigan shortstop 
Brooke Wyman that trickled deep 
enough into left field for Hutchins 
to wave Rodriguez home.
The 
successful 
small-ball 

strategy allowed Michigan to pull 
away.
“It 
manufactured 
a 
run,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“We 
weren’t 
swinging very well today, we 
were definitely not very offensive, 
so you have to find a way to 
manufacture runs. One of those 
is to steal their bases to put us in 
position. We get a pinch-hit single 
and it was a difference maker.”
Just one batter later, freshman 
left fielder Lexie 
Blair 
— 
who 
earned Big Ten 
Player 
of 
the 
Week 
honors 
last week after 
posting an .875 
batting 
average 
and eight RBI — 
poked a ground 
ball 
through 
the gap on the 
Broncos’ 
right 
side of the infield. As the ball 
made its way onto the right-field 
grass, senior center fielder Natalie 
Peters rounded third. The relay 
throw came in from Broncos’ 
outfielder Machenzie Swinehart, 
but not before Peters’ right hand 
grazed the edge of home plate 
on her slide under the catcher’s 
glove.
Though Peters’ slide put the 
game out of reach once and for all, 
it was Beaubien who kept Western 
Michigan at bay all along.

Defensive lapses costly

With a minute left in the 
first half, the Michigan men’s 
lacrosse team had spent twice as 
long down a man as No. 11 Notre 
Dame, trailed in shots taken by 
six, leaned on fifth-year senior 
Tommy Heidt’s five saves and 
won only two of the contest’s 13 
faceoffs.

It 
didn’t 
matter. 
The 
Wolverines trailed the Fighting 
Irish by only a goal. Halftime, 
and the chance to regroup 
before the deciding 30 minutes, 
beckoned Michigan like a desert 
oasis.
But it proved to be a mirage. 
Notre Dame’s lead grew twice 
and left the Wolverines with 
a halftime task three times as 
big as they expected less than a 
minute before.
The Fighting Irish’s two goals 
came from Thomas McNamara 
and John Hallenbeck, making 
the score 7-4 and continuing a 
concerning trend. Late-period, 
momentum-shifting goals have 
plagued the Wolverines so far 
this season, and they’re not 
going without notice.
“It’s something that we’re 
really 
focusing 
on,” 
said 
Michigan coach Kevin Conry. “In 
that last minute of the quarter, 
those are really, really important 
times where fundamentals are 
the most important thing. And 
we weren’t very fundamental 
on that pick, and gave the guy 
just a little extra room. But we’re 
learning.”
Michigan’s 
two 
primary 
faceoff 
men, 
sophomore 
Connor Cronin and junior Matt 
Dellacroce, have been out with 
injuries, causing a faceoff-by-
committee approach. Between 
junior defenseman Finn Goonan, 
freshman midfielder Andrew 
Russell and senior defenseman 
Nick DeCaprio, the Wolverines 
went 4-for-24 from the X against 
the Irish. The lack of competency 
at the X has made maintaining 
possession more difficult and 
contributed to the Wolverines’ 
poorly-timed lapses on defense.
It took most of the third 
quarter for Michigan to come 

roaring back to tie it. Senior 
midfielder 
Justin 
Gibbons’ 
goal with 55 seconds left in 
third quarter seemed to have 
compensated for the Wolverines’ 
defensive gaffes, and the building 
momentum was a promising sign 
headed into the game’s final 15 
minutes.
But yet again, the final minute 
betrayed 
Michigan. 
Notre 
Dame’s Griffin Westlin sprinted 
through a fatigued Wolverine 
defense to reclaim the lead with 
1.4 seconds to play.
After 
leaning 
on 
offense 
and 
goaltending 
for 
three 
resilient 
quarters, 
Michigan 
fell asleep in its own end at 
the most inopportune times. 
A combination of fresh but 
inexperienced legs on the field 
and tired, experienced ones 
made errors on defense and took 
ill-advised penalties. The fourth 
quarter proved to be the most 
lopsided, as Notre Dame scored 
three unanswered goals — two 
within the first five minutes — to 
seal the victory.
“It’s hard when they go on a 
run and you’re deficient in the 
faceoff X,” Conry said. “That’s 
been one of the things that’s 
been plaguing us as this little 
stretch here continues. … I 
thought Notre Dame had a smart 
adjustment where they started to 
suck the life a little bit out of the 
ball and use the whole shot clock 
and that got our guys tired.”
The Wolverines have the 
offensive skill and ability to 
beat highly ranked opponents, 
but 
won’t 
until 
they 
play 
good enough defense to go 
on prolonged scoring runs of 
their own. No matter how big 
of an impact it had, injuries to 
Michigan’s faceoff men aren’t 
entirely to blame. And Conry 
knows it.
“When we could ride and 
create that tempo, it doesn’t 
really matter about our faceoff 
deficiencies,” 
Conry 
said. 
“Health is something we need 
to keep working on. We need to 
get some guys back, that’s for 
sure. But overall, our attention to 
detail and our fundamentals are 
something we will consistently 
focus on.”

Student-athletes create group to help survivors of sexual assault

In observance of Women’s History 
Month, The Daily’s sports section is 
launching its second annual series 
aimed at telling the stories of female 
athletes, coaches and teams at the 
University from the perspective of 
the female sports writers on staff. We 
continue the series with this story 
from Daily Sports Writer Molly 
Shea. 
Sydney Wetterstrom and Sam 
Roy have a lot in common.
They both love yoga. Spending 
time with friends. Writing.
They’re both juniors, involved 
with 
athletics 
at 
Michigan 
and 
dedicated 
to 
school. 
If 
Wetterstrom’s not on the volleyball 
court, killing and blocking, she’s in 
the classroom working toward a 
double major in Spanish and Health 
and Fitness. In Roy’s case, she 
balances her new role as a student 
assistant coach for the women’s 
gymnastics team — after spending 
two years on the team as a gymnast 
— with studying Neuroscience on 
the pre-med track.
Beyond 
these 
surface 
level 
connections, Roy and Wetterstrom 
have a deeper common thread. Both 
are survivors of sexual assault.
In late February, the two women 
co-founded 
Student 
Athlete 
Sexual Health. It’s a support group 
specifically for student-athletes 
that identify as sexual assault 
survivors or know someone who 
has been affected by it. Meetings 
are held on a bimonthly basis and 
provide a safe, confidential place 
for athletes to share their struggles, 
triumphs and support.
“This group was started because 
we want people to know how real 
this issue is,” Roy said. “So many 
people go through it and sometimes 
people aren’t willing to talk about it. 
We’re hoping to bring that stigma 
out of the word ‘sexual abuse.’ ”
The stigma surrounding sexual 
abuse is undeniable, but it’s a topic 
that has to be discussed, especially 
given the statistics.
According to the National Sexual 

Violence Resource Center, 20 to 25 
percent of women and 15 percent 
of men are survivors of forced sex 
during their college years. And 
even more unsettling: More than 
90 percent of victims do not report 
their assault.
“Pursuing legal action is hard,” 
Wetterstrom said. “You’re just 
some kid in some file cabinet, 
where your story may never be 
opened again. They may never find 
the perpetrator, that person may be 
out there affecting so many more 
young individuals.”
The two connected the same 
way everyone does — via social 
media. In November, Roy was 
scrolling through her Instagram 
feed when she found Wetterstrom’s 
post that detailed her sexual 
assault. She immediately reached 
out and offered support, plus an 
invitation for coffee.
“I knew I had had her number,” 
Roy said. “We weren’t the closest 
of friends but we knew each other. 
I just reached out and said, ‘Hey I 
know what you’re going through.’ 
I know for me I’d always wanted 
to start a group. Syd had a similar 
idea, and we both jumped on board 
with it.”
And just like that, the framework 
for 
what 
would 
eventually become 
SASH was born.
The two spent 
the 
following 
months 
working 
out 
the 
details 
and 
logistics 
of 
the group before 
bringing it to the 
Athletic Counseling 
Team for approval. 
Abigail 
Eiler, 
assistant director of ACT, was 
instrumental in getting the group 
on its feet. Eiler is present at all 
group meetings to provide support 
and assist Roy and Wetterstrom 
with facilitation of the difficult 
conversations that trauma entails.
But before these women could 
become allies for other survivors, 
they had to heal and cope with their 
own traumas. They believe the path 

to healing isn’t linear. There’s light 
and dark. Good days and bad days. 
Wetterstrom was forced to deal 
with the aftermath of her assault 
in the middle of volleyball season 
this fall.
“It was extremely challenging 
to return to play because the same 
physiological experiences occurred 
in both events,” Wetterstrom said. 
“The fight-or-flight response in one 
situation benefits you and allows 
you to perform to the best of your 
ability and be strong and compete, 
and at the other end it allows you 
to survive. Any time I was in an 
intense 
fight-or-flight 
response 
situation, it was as if I was reliving 
the assault. It took time for me to 
separate the two and realize that I 
am safe.”
Roy 
suffered 
abuse 
while 
receiving 
treatment 
for 
a 
gymnastics injury. She spent the 
beginning of her healing process 
keeping her assault private and 
dealing with it internally. But 
watching other women, like her 
teammates and role models within 
the sport, come forward and 
confront their abuser, inspired her 
to open up about her abuse. With 
the help of her psychologist, Roy is 
working on moving past the trauma 
and sharing her 
story with others.
“For 
the 
longest time I 
was 
silenced,” 
Roy said. “I feel 
like I’m finally 
standing on my 
own two feet. 
I’m 
standing 
up 
and 
using 
my 
resources. 
Women 
empower women. I truly feel that 
me getting to use my voice has 
given me back a part of that I felt 
like I had lost.”
For Roy and Wetterstrom, that’s 
their favorite part of SASH — 
empowering and helping others to 
find their voices and heal. It’s about 
providing a space where anyone is 
welcome and everyone is ready and 
willing to listen.

The group emphasizes that 
there’s no universal path to dealing 
with the trauma of being sexually 
assaulted. But they want to help 
survivors find their way. Whether 
it’s mediation, keeping a gratitude 
journal or finding three things 
every day to be grateful for, they 
have a plethora of mechanisms to 
equip survivors with.
“We 
always 
talk about what 
coping strategies 
work for you may 
not work for the 
person sitting next 
to you,” Roy said. 
“We might have 
something for you 
and it might work 
a couple times and 
then we have to 
switch something 
up, or it might work for the rest of 
your life.”
Roy and Wetterstrom want 
survivors to know that there’s light 
in the darkness. That they can, 
and will, get through it. They’ve 
experienced 
a 
surprising 
and 
welcome result since going public 
with their stories — other survivors 
are reaching out to them.
“By coming public with it and 

telling your story, people then 
reach out to you,” Wetterstrom 
said. “You find you have similar 
pasts. And as brutal as those pasts 
may be, it’s comforting to know 
you’re not alone.”
While the group is currently 
only open to student-athletes, the 
university has support groups 
through SAPAC that are peer-led 
and open to all 
students.
“To 
make 
it 
an 
individual 
group for student-
athletes 
because 
they exhibit the 
same 
stressors 
and opportunities 
and expectations 
is 
something 
that 
makes 
it 
specialized,” 
Wetterstrom said. “It’s just a safe 
place for everyone, and that’s the 
most important thing.”
But if you go looking for 
information on this group on any 
of the athletic department’s web 
pages, your search will come up 
empty. They want to change that.
“The University of Michigan 
has never done anything with 
malintent,” Wetterstrom said. “But 

two women can only do so much 
to spread the word. We’re creating 
a group for individuals in athletics 
and I know it’s not a glamorous 
topic. It’s not Big Ten basketball, 
or Big Ten football. But it’s an 
issue that we have on campus, 
on campuses down the road, 
campuses in other states, and yet I 
feel like it’s being swept under the 
rug and I would love more support 
from (the athletic department).”
While SASH is still in the 
beginning stages, its leaders have 
big plans for the future. Right now, 
they’re focusing on baby steps. 
A logo. Creating a GroupMe for 
members. Acknowledgement from 
the athletic department. The bigger 
plans involve getting other Big Ten 
schools to create similar support 
groups and eventually every school 
in the NCAA.
“Whether there’s three people in 
our meeting, or 300,” Wetterstrom 
said, “we’re happy to help anyone.”
If you or someone you know has 
been affected by sexual assault, it’s 
not your fault. You are not alone. 
Help is available 24/7. Contact the 
National Sexual Assault Hotline at 
1-800-656-HOPE. The University 
of Michigan has a 24/7 crisis hotline 
734-936-3333.

Roundtable: The Daily basketball beat on Michigan’s chances in March

 Michigan is back in the NCAA 
Tournament. Now what?
The 
Wolverines’ 
selection 
to the tournament, which they 
will open by playing No. 15 seed 
Montana on Thursday night in 
Des Moines, Iowa, seemed to 
be met with a collective ennui. 
After all, this was a team that, 
just an hour earlier, suffered a 
heartbreaking loss to Michigan 
State, this time in the Big Ten 
Tournament 
championship 
game, and went just 6-4 over 
its final 10 games — three of the 
losses coming to the Spartans. In 
opposition to previous seasons in 
which Michigan hit its stride in 
March, this team almost limped 
to the finish.
Still, the Wolverines didn’t 
start a program-record 17-0, 
win 28 games and earn a No. 
2 seed for nothing. Despite an 
inconsistent offense, they have 
the second-best defense in the 
country, per KenPom — a stingy 
unit that should allow them to 
compete with anyone in the 

bracket. In what appears to be 
a manageable West Regional, 
Michigan, should it put its recent 
struggles behind it, will fancy 
its chances of dancing deep into 
March and possibly April.
But will it actually do so? 
The Daily men’s basketball beat 
writers offer their predictions of 
Michigan’s postseason fate:
Aria Gerson: John Beilein has 
a reputation as a coach capable 
of March magic. With a team 
that won more games and earned 
a higher seed — No. 2 — than 
last year’s squad that made the 
national title game, expectations 
are once again high for the 
Wolverines.
Like last year, they should 
handle No. 15 seed Montana fairly 
easily. The Grizzlies have a lot of 
experience and can shoot, but 
lack size. That won’t serve them 
well against junior center Jon 
Teske. 
Ultimately, 
Michigan’s 
defense will overwhelm Montana 
in a low-scoring affair that may 
stay close in the first half.
In the second round, the 
Wolverines would meet either 
No. 7 seed Nevada or No. 10 

seed 
Florida. 
The 
Wolfpack 
are not quite as good as their 
reputation, and while the Gators 
have a few impressive wins, 
they also lost to SEC bottom-
feeder Georgia. Considering how 
Michigan looked against lower-
tier tournament teams in the Big 
Ten Tournament — beating Iowa 
and Minnesota by a combined 48 
points — it should handle either 
of these opponents as well.
But once the Wolverines start 
playing better teams, they will 
run into trouble with a lack of 
offensive options. Michigan will 
find its way to the Sweet 16 for 
the third straight year, but that’s 
where their season will come to 
an end — most likely in a low-
scoring slugfest against No. 3 
seed Texas Tech.
Jacob Shames: Looking at 
the bracket as a whole, Michigan 
has to be pleased with its draw. 
There’s no nightmare matchup 
in its way like a second-round 
run-in with Syracuse’s 2-3 zone, 
and Gonzaga is perceived as the 
weakest of the four No. 1 seeds in 
the bracket.
It’s hard for me to see the 

Wolverines failing to make it 
out of Des Moines. They should 
handle Montana in the first round, 
Nevada’s talented, but isolation-
heavy offense plays right into 
their hands, and a cursory 
glance at Florida’s statistical 
profile seems to show a worse 
version of Michigan, essentially. 
In the Sweet 16, Texas Tech’s 
defense, per KenPom, is the lone 
unit in the nation better than 
Michigan’s. But while shooting 
guard Jarrett Culver is legit, 
the Red Raiders’ offense mostly 
starts and ends with him. With 
Charles Matthews neutralizing 
Culver, the Wolverines will win 
a rock fight and move on to play 
Gonzaga.
But that’s where Michigan’s 
road will end.
Jon Teske is just one man, 
Ignas Brazdeikis doesn’t quite 
have a power forward’s size, and 
the Wolverines have had trouble 
guarding versatile forwards like 
Lamar Stevens, Luka Garza and 
Xavier Tillman. The Bulldogs 
have two.
Rui Hachimura and Brandon 
Clarke are absolute monsters 

that can score, defend and crash 
the glass with anyone, and Josh 
Perkins, Zach Norvell and Corey 
Kispert can light it up from 
3-point range. Don’t be fooled 
by the “Ain’t Played Nobody!” 
crowd: Gonzaga is for real. It 
might not have the reputation 
of a Duke or a North Carolina, 
but Michigan has yet to prove it 
can beat teams of the Bulldogs’ 
caliber.
In a game eerily reminiscent of 
the three games against Michigan 
State, Gonzaga pulls away down 
the stretch, the Wolverines can’t 
find a bucket-getter to elevate 
them over a superior team, and 
their season ends in Anaheim.
Ethan 
Sears: 
Across 
the 
board, Michigan’s draw wasn’t 
just considered favorable, but 
as good as it could have possibly 
been. Gonzaga is, universally, 
seen as the weakest 1-seed — and 
that seems to dictate how people 
are viewing this. I’m not entirely 
sure that’s correct.
You can chalk the first-round 
game against Montana up as 
a win. Barring some kind of 
disaster, the Wolverines win that 
on talent alone. But every matchup 
after that is deceptively tough. 
Nevada has underperformed all 
season. Assuming they get past 
Florida, though, the Wolfpack 
also have multiple NBA-caliber 
players such as Caleb Martin 
and Jordan Caroline. It’s a game 
Michigan should win. It’s also a 
tough 7-seed to play in the second 
round.
Play out the rest of the bracket 
from there and the matchups 
all feel similar. The Wolverines 
should beat Texas Tech in the 
Sweet 16. Nobody would be 
surprised if they didn’t.
This draw isn’t easy, but it does 
put Michigan’s fate into its own 
hands. It won’t lose any of these 
games because it can’t match 
up with any of these teams, 
including 
Gonzaga. 
Whether 
the Wolverines play up to that 
potential is a different question 
entirely, and one their collective 
performances against Michigan 
State make hard to answer.
Right now, it’s hard to see 
this team putting it together 
offensively for enough games in a 
row to make it back to the Final 

Four. The consistency just hasn’t 
been there, especially against 
higher-level competition.
Michigan’s 
season 
ends 
against Florida State in the Elite 
Eight.
Theo Mackie: On Sunday 
afternoon in Chicago, Michigan 
lost the Big Ten championship 
game to Michigan State — its 
third loss to the Spartans in three 
weeks. But despite the season 
sweep, it took mere minutes 
for the moods of the respective 
fanbases to turn.
While Michigan State was 
selected as the No. 2 seed in the 
NCAA Tournament’s East region, 
the Wolverines were sent out west 
— the prescribed punishment for 
being selected as the last 2-seed. 
Except the West boasts the 
last No. 1 seed, Gonzaga, while 
the East is headlined by Zion 
Williamson and Duke.
Armed 
with 
a 
year 
of 
experience against Montana, its 
first-round opponent last year, 
Michigan should avoid the slow 
start that it had a year ago and 
cruise to the Round of 32. Neither 
of its two potential opponents 
there should inspire much fear. 
Florida ranks 61st in adjusted 
offensive efficiency — a death 
knell if you’re hoping to beat the 
Wolverines — while Nevada’s 
individualistic 
offensive 
style 
should be no problem for Zavier 
Simpson and Michigan. The 
bigger reason that the Wolverines 
should 
stroll 
to 
the 
Sweet 
16, though, is that this team 
rarely runs into trouble against 
mediocre teams.
The problem is that it also 
rarely finds success against elite 
ones, at least since late December. 
And after a potential matchup 
with Texas Tech in the Sweet 16 
that stacks up as a first-to-50-
wins defensive battle, an elite 
team is exactly what Michigan 
will face. That may come in the 
form of Gonzaga, one of the 
country’s most talented teams, 
or Florida State, one of its biggest 
and deepest.
And unless the Wolverines 
solve the offensive issues that 
have plagued them for months, 
that’s going to be a problem. 
Ultimately, they’ll fall one game 
short of the Final Four.

We want 
people to know 
how real this 
issue is.

I feel like I’m 
finally standing 
on my own two 
feet.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | FEBRUARY 20, 2019

Running along

S
trewn 
in the 
corner was a pair of beat-up, grey 
and light blue Nike running sneakers.
“Are these yours?” my roommate asked.
“Yep!” I responded.
“Are you throwing them out?”
“Um … no not yet.”
She looked at me, confused, and walked 
away. From my desk, I could see my sneak-
ers peeking out from behind the trash can. 

I slyly 
tip-
toed 
over, 
picked 
them up to 
inspect 
the rips around 
the laces and placed them back in my clos-
et. I kept doing this for a week, putting my 
sneakers by the trash with the intent of 
throwing them out and then taking them 
back.
Yesterday I finally parted ways with 
them. As we left the apartment, my room-
mate watched reassuringly as I gave my 
sneakers one last longing look, took a deep 
breath and tossed them into the dumpster. 
Dramatic, I know. It’s just that my feet had 
called this particularly pair of sneakers 

home for eight years. They had 
molded perfectly around each 
toe and knew everything 
about where I’d been. I just 
didn’t think there would 
ever be a time to say good-
bye.
The bottoms of these 
sneakers were practically 
shaved off due to my love 
for long-distance running 
— a hobby that stems from a 
childhood of long walks with 
my grandpa. What I remem-
ber most about him was his 
penchant for going on unrea-
sonably long walks whenever 
he visited my family in America. 
We would leave for hours at a 
time and meander around, hop-
ing not to get lost with his lim-
ited English and my nonexistent 
map skills. I would stand next to 
him, trying to mirror the length 
of his steps and bending back to 
match his beer belly. Those are 
my favorite memories — walking 
side by side, town to town. Before 
cell phones, before growing up and 
before Parkinson’s, it was just us two.
The diagnosis came to us as a com-
plete shock. My grandpa had been a 
force of nature, always on the go, but 
suddenly this disease made it seem like 
the older he got, the younger he became. It 
was painful to sit at the kitchen table and 
watch silently as he struggled to cut his 
food but refused to let us help and succumb 
to the disease. We watched as he lost his 
ability to move his body, his ability to be 
self-sufficient and, eventually, his memory. 
He passed away because with everything 
he lost, he held onto his stubbornness. 
Refusing to sit still, he insisted on walking 
so he could get better and get on a plane one 
last time to visit me in America. On his last 
long walk, he took a hard fall and was gone. 
This is what you would have learned if you 
were in my shoes four years ago.
After his passing, the runs were long, 
angry and sad. When I ran, I experienced 
a pain that made sense and physically 
manifested itself. I could focus solely on 
breathing, and forget all the worries and 

responsibilities in my life. I ran until I was 
so exhausted that I couldn’t feel. I was 
resentful that I couldn’t attend his funeral 
all the way in Korea, and I was devastated 
that the last thing I got to tell him was that 
I had been accepted to the University of 
Michigan. Never would I be able to walk 
alongside him and talk for hours about how 
amazing my life would become. During 
those runs, I was really heartbroken.
Eventually though, the runs got hap-
pier and freer because through my runs, I 
found closure. With every mile, I thought 
about the times I did get to have with my 
grandpa. How on our long walks, we would 
talk about his childhood in the rural areas 
of Korea, and how I would fill him in on the 
latest book I was reading or the new friend 
I had made at school. The runs became 
less about expelling anger and more about 
reflecting on our extraordinary relation-
ship. I began to slip on my sneakers with 
enthusiasm, ready to take another joy-filled 
run for the day.
Those sneakers were my crutch for eight 
years. Throwing them away was hard 
because I was throwing away my sole com-
panion in the especially difficult days after 
my grandpa was gone. They had been with 
me every step of the way, literally. There 
were hard times, yes, but I think back now 
that there had been even more great times. 
I wore them for every field hockey game—
celebrating in them after an incredible 
nationals win. We took the very first step 
out of the van and into Ann Arbor together, 
to the place where I would grow and learn 
the most. We avoided the ‘M’ on the Diag as 
we learned the nuances of college life, and 
trekked miles around cobblestoned Europe 
during an incredible semester abroad.
Today I got a new pair and presented 
them proudly to my roommate. “My feet 
have a new home!” I exclaimed as she 
laughed. Then I stepped outside, ready to 
log a new set of miles that would take me 
who-knows-where. I started with a left 
and ran, just not away from something or 
against someone. I ran towards another 
exciting, unforeseen eight years and I ran 
for my grandpa. Sometimes I even like to 
think he’s here again, healthy, and running 
with me.

I 

went to Stuyvesant High School in 
New York City. Stuyvesant was a 
part of the eight “specialized high 
schools” run by the NYC Department of 
Education that “supports the educational 
needs of students who excel academically 
and/or artistically.” To be admitted, stu-
dents needed to score well on an exam 
called the SHSAT (Specialized High School 
Admissions Test). Stuyvesant stood at the 
top of the nine schools, and my experience 
there unfortunately both met and exceed-
ed its grandeur and intimidating image.
The picture I am about to paint in your 
mind may seem like fiction, but all I can 
say is that I wish it was: Most students 
wake up at 6 in the morning to make a 
one-hour commute to school, they sleep 
about four hours a night, they have about 
eight to nine academic classes scheduled 
per day, of which about four to five of them 
are Advanced Placement or honors classes. 
When school ends at 4 in the afternoon, 
most students have around one to two 
hours of extracurricular activities (which 
colleges love), then they get home around 
6 or 7 to work on their mountain load of 
homework until 2 a.m. Yet, even the seven 
to eight hours of studying students do a 
night is not enough time to finish all the 
work assigned to them.
Of course, students did have the option 
to take fewer classes and not participate in 
extracurricular activities, but it simply was 
not a choice for many. The peer pressure 
and cut-throat environment of my high 
school severely limited students’ autonomy 
over their decisions.
You could only imagine the mental and 
physical toll this would have on the stu-
dents. Mental health was a big issue at 
Stuyvesant. A year didn’t go by without 
hearing about a suicide attempt or students 
suffering from depression or anxiety.
Being in this kind of environment fos-
tered a perpetual restlessness inside of me. 
There was always something that needed 
to be done. It didn’t matter the month, 
week, day or hour.
This feeling of being chased by deadlines 
didn’t go away even during breaks or the 
summer months. There was always sum-
mer homework and the need to prepare for 
the next big thing —the SAT, SAT subject 
tests, next year’s curriculum and college 
essays. I don’t remember if there was ever a 
moment when I felt like I didn’t have some-
thing I had to do.
I became used to this kind of constant 
pressure and developed a persistent need 
to keep myself occupied. This is why I 
wrote notes from my biology textbook 
on train rides to and from church, why I 
brought my design homework to volunteer-
ing events, why I laminated my chemistry 
notes and studied them in the shower, why 
I read on my bus rides to school, why I read 
from small sheets of paper on my bike rides 
to school and why I studied while walking 

to class.
Sustaining this lifestyle of constantly 
doing something developed into my need 
for constant stimulation. If I didn’t feel 
stimulated by anything, I felt like I was 
wasting time. Whenever I was in the show-
er, doing the laundry or washing the dishes, 
I felt the need to at least turn on a YouTube 
video or listen to music.
Being a child of immigrant parents and 
coming from an Asian family with high 
expectations also heavily influenced this 
type of behavior. My mother always com-
pared me to other students and insisted 
that I must keep working no matter what. 
She was quite emphatic of this to the point 
that whenever I slept, I would be terri-
fied of my mother catching me in the act, 
because she always yelled at me when I was 
unconscious.
Everything changed when I entered the 
University of Michigan as a freshman. The 
main difference was that I began to have 
so much free time. At first I embraced this 
change; after all, who doesn’t like a break? 
During my free time, I started to work on 
my unfinished novel from middle school, 
read books and spent time watching vid-
eos. But, eventually my pervasive habits 
from high school began creeping back into 
my life.

I started feeling restless again. I was 
conditioned to stress, so I wasn’t comfort-
able with any other state of mind. I was 
anxious whenever I didn’t have something 
to do in the upcoming hour. I felt guilty if I 
took an hour of break at the end of the day. I 
never did anything unless it had a purpose. 
And you may find this the craziest of all: 
Whenever I walked into a bathroom stall, 
I found it necessary to console myself that I 
wasn’t wasting time.
When I stopped to reflect on why I 
would not let myself fully adopt the more 
relaxed lifestyle I had indulged in at the 
beginning of my freshman year, I arrived at 
three answers. 
First, I feel like I am in a race — one that 
will not end until I die. Let me clarify: In 
this race, I feel like I am being tested as a 
human being. If I do not build up perse-
verance and a tolerance to stressful events 
now, I believe in 20 years I will feel inade-
quate as a human being. Of course, the abil-
ity to handle stressful events is not the only 
measure of human competence, but it is the 
one I find myself emphasizing the most.
Second, it was simply difficult to get rid 
of old habits. I kept telling myself, “Life 
won’t always be as easy as it is now.” I won’t 
always have a few hours to spare and relax 
every day. I won’t always have the oppor-

tunity to sleep eight hours a day. I won’t 
always be blessed with a light workload. 
Hence, by indulging myself right now and 
not toughening myself up, I would become 
unprepared for life’s misery in the future, 
thus dooming myself to failure. These grim 
thoughts about the future, led me back to 
my first point: Stuyvesant taught me that 
what I experienced during high school 
would be what the “adult world” was going 
to be like. I couldn’t expect anything but a 
stressful future, because that was the only 
thing that life had given me in the past. And 
who can blame me? If the only thing that 
life teaches you is suffering, how can you 
hope for anything else?
I watched a TV show a couple years ago 
about a protagonist who suffered from 
child abuse and developed schizophrenia 
as a result. The protagonist compared him-
self to a camel. He explained how owners 
of camels tie the animals to desert trees 
during the night. The next morning, even 
when the owners untie their camels, they 
don’t run away. The camels remember 
their imprisonment to the tree the night 
before, so they remain “trapped” there the 
next morning — just like how we remem-
ber our past wounds. The pain manifests 
into a trauma and our past keeps us forever 
chained and imprisoned.

s a wall painter in Allen Park, Ryan 
Flores had been sober for over a decade 
after his arrest in 2006 for possession 
of cocaine and other narcotics. Through paint-
ing, he was managing to provide a steady source 
of income for his son, Andrew. Andrew’s mother, 
who also had problems with drug abuse, left them 
both when Andrew was born. As Andrew’s pri-
mary caretaker, Flores was a constant presence 
for his son. They went to nature parks, concerts, 
restaurants — as his sister Stefanie Veselaneck 
described to me, “They would do everything 
together. … They were inseparable.”
“I was able to save money and I had a vehicle. I 
don’t know. It was just a better life,” Flores said of 
the years after his release. He managed to grow 
his business and provide security for his son dur-
ing this time.
About 9 years later, though, in November 2016, 
Flores was on his way to work when he got in a car 
accident, totaling his truck and injuring his back 
and wrist. The company that towed his car, West-
land Car Care Automotive, connected him with 
the Southfield Pain Clinic, which would pick him 
up from his home and take him to various clini-
cians and doctors to treat his pain.
One of the doctors he visited, Dr. Johnny Trot-
ter II, began prescribing him medications such as 
OxyContin and Xanax to alleviate his pain, his 
mother said. Flores disclosed his prior drug histo-
ry with the doctor. However, he trusted Trotter’s 
credibility and took the prescribed analgesics, 
despite OxyContin being a potent and addictive 
opioid (Trotter has since been convicted of health 
care fraud totaling over $28 million in cash and 
property).
“That was probably one of the roughest times 
I’ve ever had … I think a lot of it had to do with 
the Xanax,” Flores said in a phone interview 
from prison, referencing the prescriptions he 
was given. “I mean I’m sure it was everything … 
But like I was taking the Xanax and … the muscle 
relaxers that were prescribed.”
As the opioid crisis has demonstrated, Oxy-
Contin and oxycodone, the generic form of the 
drug, have also led people to turn to more potent 
drugs, such as heroin and fentanyl. Soon after, 
Flores began abusing his prescriptions, and when 

he couldn’t receive any more, he started stealing 
them. Months after the accident, he broke into a 
home during a high stupor.
A week later, the police broke down the door 
of his mother’s house where he was living and 
arrested Flores, taking him away for questioning. 
The effects of the drugs were still clouding his 
judgment during the interrogation.
“I felt like I was going to die … There’s really no 
way else to explain how that works,” Flores said 
while recounting the arrest. 
He was told the prosecutor would seek a life 
sentence should he not accept a plea bargain. 
Flores, still inundated by the effects of the opi-
oids, accepted the bargain. He was charged as a 
fourth time habitual offender, despite not coming 
into conflict with the law in over nine years, with 
his other arrests occurring as a minor in 1996.
The plea and sentencing, which lasted a total 
of 18 minutes, sent Flores to prison for a five-year 
minimum sentence, mandated $3,700 in restitu-
tion and $1,300 in court fees. Veselaneck, a single 
mom who works at the Rusted Crow Distillery in 
Dearborn Heights, claimed the counsel was seem-
ingly uninterested in helping Flores.
“Obviously we don’t have the money, so (Ryan) 
wasn’t able to go and get an amazing attorney,” 
she said, recalling the trial. “So he had to get a 
court appointed one and … they didn’t care.”
Her nephew, Andrew, claimed the lawyer said, 
“He had two honeys waiting for him in Chicago 
and he was just trying to get out for the weekend.”
In a letter Flores wrote to Judge Sean F. Cox, he 
said one of his attorneys said he “just wanted to 
get my arraignment over with.”
After the sentencing, the victim forgave Flores, 
who showed immense guilt for his crime. Howev-
er, this was after the sentence was delivered and 
didn’t alter his conviction.
Flores appealed his sentence, claiming his 
counsel was ineffective due to the revolving door 
of lawyers sent from the public defender to work 
on his case and the waiving of a preliminary 
examination. He also appealed the imposed court 
costs of $1,300 on account of indigence, or extreme 
poverty due to his lack of verifiable employment at 
the time of the arrest. His appeal was denied and 
his sentence was reaffirmed.

Flores’ appeals lawyer, Jayne Carver, spoke 
with me about the nature of his sentencing.
“He did get a sentencing agreement. So he 
actually was sentenced to lower than his guide-
line range.” She said that there is a “big however,” 
which is called the “10-year gap rule,” where felo-
nies more than 10 years old cannot be counted as 
habitual offenders.
“Unfortunately it’s from a discharge date of 
his last offense until the commission of the new 
offense,” she continued, “which in his case was I 
think about 9 years. So, in my opinion, his guide-
line score was artificially inflated.”
His background is something that may have 
come up during a preliminary examination. How-
ever, one of his court-appointed attorneys waived 
the preliminary exam, which would have deter-
mined if there was probable cause to proceed to 
trial, though it is unclear how much this would 
have impacted his trial considering he admitted 
to his crime.
F

lores’ case is an aggravation of systemic 
issues facing working class individuals, 
both in Michigan and the United States. 
It is also, in part, an example of the opioid epi-
demic, which has ravaged communities across 
the Midwest as pharmaceutical companies have 
exploited people like Flores.
Heather Ann Thompson, a University of Michi-
gan professor in the History and Afroameri-
can and African Studies departments as well as 
a Pulitzer-winning author for her work on the 
Attica Prison Uprising of 1971, described how this 
story exhibits the common practice of incarcerat-
ing people with substance abuse problems.
“Those who have run afoul of the law often do 
so for reasons of health, you know, addiction, pub-
lic health reasons, not actual criminal justice rea-
sons,” she said.
In a study conducted between 2007 and 2009 
by the U.S. Department of Justice, over half of 
state prisoners and two-thirds of jail inmates met 
the criteria for substance abuse or dependence. 
This study was conducted prior to the current 
opioid crisis and doesn’t take into account the 
massive increase in drug abuse that ensued in the 
years following. Such criminalizing policies also 
disproportionately impact people of color. 

Once the system ensnares people like Flores, 
it exploits their families’ finances, as Thompson 
described.
“It requires poverty to get into the system to 
begin with,” she said. “And ironically, once you 
get into the system, the one thing you need most 
to navigate it as a family and as an incarcerated 
person is money.”
Incarcerated people on average have a median 
income of $19,185 prior to their imprisonment, a 
figure that is 41 percent less than non-incarcerat-
ed people.
Sandra Parker, Flores’ mom, spoke of the myri-
ad of ways she is bankrolling her son’s health and 
safety from outside the prison walls of the Cot-
ton Correctional Facility in Jackson. One would 
assume the prison provides the items she buys 
for Flores. But often, some of the necessities that 
Parker has to pay for are not provided at all by the 
prison. In the items that are provided, the issue 
lies within the quality of the necessities they 
are receiving. There have been several recorded 
instances in Michigan prisons of maggots, mold 
and “crunchy dirt” found in the prison cafeteria 
food.
“Deodorant, toothpaste, soap, food, you know, 
socks, underwear. And with the winter, we had to 
buy him two sets of gloves and hats because they 
get stolen. And (the prison doesn’t) care,” Parker 
said. “A pair of socks is like $12. It’s like two some-
thing for one package of ramen over there.” A pack 
of ramen noodles at Meijer is typically about $1.
There are also transportation costs. From the 
area they live in to Flores’ prison, Flores’ sister 
said that to drive, “It’s about an hour and 10 min-
utes maybe.”
She noted that her car’s low mileage usually 
means that she has to refill her tank every time 
she wants to visit him. Sometimes, because her 
mother prefers not to drive on the highway, she 
will drive her. And if they cannot visit Flores that 
week, there are the costs associated with placing 
calls and sending and receiving emails.
When I asked how much these expenses totaled 
up to, she said some months it can reach up to 
$1,300. This may also include copays to visit the 
medical infirmary, which Flores says is usually 
around $5 a visit for something as low-mainte-

nance as a headache. Flores said he makes just 40 
to 50 cents a day in his GED course, making it dif-
ficult to pay for such expenses on his own.
Though Ryan has the support of his mother, for 
others, not having family on the outside can exac-
erbate these issues. There’s also the concern over 
paying his restitution, which is the recompense 
that perpetrators are ordered to pay victims. This 
is usually taken from the funds put in one’s com-
missary and wages they accumulate from the jobs 
given inside prison.
This kind of spending strains his family’s 
finances. Parker is a special education teacher at 
the Creative Montessori Academy in Southgate, 
and the items Parker mentioned don’t begin to 
touch the payments Flores and his family will 
have to make if he is released on parole.
Flores and his family’s pecuniary engagement 
with the prison is not the result of his criminal 
background (which is a non-violent one that stems 
from issues with addiction, a health issue state 
and federal lawmakers have a penchant for crimi-
nalizing). It is the product of a web of private 
corporations capitalizing on families who try to 
care for their incarcerated loved ones and is rei-
fied by state and federal policies. This engenders 
an inter-generational struggle, creating a vicious 
cycle of indemnity that can easily damage fami-
lies and communities.
O

n March 13, the Carceral State Project 
hosted their fifth event at the Univer-
sity. The project, which was spearhead-
ed in 2016 by Thompson, brings the community 
together to discuss the impacts of mass incarcera-
tion. At the event, the panel members discussed 
how incarceration disrupts and destroys commu-
nities — for example, how children can be adverse-
ly affected through policies that inure them at an 
early age to the criminal justice system. The panel 
of five consisted of experts, counselors and com-
munity activists. This included Kathie Gourlay, 
whose son had been previously incarcerated.
Gourlay and her husband, Don Campbell, who 
are an older couple whose years are dense with 
interactions with the criminal justice system, dis-
cussed the exhaustive list of costs associated with 
supporting a family member in prison.
“We only went (drove) five and a half hours,” 

Gourlay said, describing the weekends her and 
Campbell took to visit their son, who was incar-
cerated in a prison in the Upper Peninsula. There 
are 31 prisons in Michigan, holding more than 
45,000 inmates. Six of those prisons are in the 
Upper Peninsula, a far drive for most, especially 
considering that the majority of crime in Michi-
gan occurs within the Metro Detroit area.
“And we’d have to spend the night and the 
bridge is eight dollars to go over,” she continued, 
detailing a trek that can be perilous during the 
biting cold of winter.
“Not to mention the gas,” Campbell chimed in. 
“So you’re looking at $50 to $70 in gas.”
And despite the extensive lengths the couple 
would take, there was still the possibility they 
would be denied entry. If a prisoner were to get 
into an altercation, then they would be held in a 
secure facility that has separate visiting hours. 
This happened on one occasion to the couple, and 
they were not informed of this until they arrived 
at the prison, after preparing and driving for a 
weekend-long trip.
“Once you’re in prison, they don’t care about 
the family,” Gourlay said during the program. 
“The only time they’ll tell you anything is if your 
family member is almost dead.”
Later that week, I spoke over the phone with 
James Dankovich. Dankovich is a chiroprac-
tor who is involved with several criminal justice 
initiatives. His son, Chris, has been incarcerated 
since 2005. He said there were several instances 
in which he would drive over an hour to visit his 
son, only to be denied entry because of a security 
drill.
“Sometimes the facility will have what’s called 
an emergency count, which means you drive all 
the way up there to the facility and they won’t let 
you see your loved one because they’re running a 
security drill and they have a mandatory number 
of (emergency drills),” Dankovich said.
The panelists at the event discussed how time 
consuming these trips can be, especially for a 
lower-income family who already has to set aside 
money for such traveling. Often, this means a 
prisoner won’t end up receiving visitors.
“We spent one full visiting day in the winter. 
We were the only visitors,” said Gourlay, describ-

ing one particular trip. “There’s 2,000 prisoners 
there.”
The emptied visiting rooms reflect the oner-
ous journey that hinders a family’s attempt to see 
loved ones. One study by the Prison Policy Initia-
tive found less than a third of people in state pris-
ons receive visits from family or friends in a given 
month. Another saw, among incarcerated people 
locked up less than 50 miles from their home, 
about half of them receive visits. This number 
dwindles dramatically as the distance grows. And 
arduous travel is just one of systemic factors that 
separates families.
Several states have austere policies that further 
hinder a family’s ability to visit, despite studies 
demonstrating that visits and, hence, the mainte-
nance of family ties, serve as one of the leading 
ways to reduce recidivism, or reentry into prison. 
States such as New York are more lenient, permit-
ting visits any day of the year. Others are more 
restrictive. North Carolina allows visits only once 
a week. Beyond limits on number of visits, there 
are also invasive policies such as those found in 
Arkansas and Kentucky, which requires pro-
spective visitors to submit their social security 
numbers upon entry request. In Arizona, travel 
isn’t the only consideration made when visiting; 
visitors must also pay a $25 background check fee 
before a prison permits your entrance.
Some policies are so vague they can be inter-
preted at the whim of the correctional officer on 
duty. In Washington state, a ban on “excessive 
emotion” is a rule left to the discretion of officers, 
meaning they can remove people indiscriminate-
ly.
Some states have begun reforming these poli-
cies, looking to close the gap between family mem-
bers on the outside and inside. While Washington 
state is home to such unnecessary legislation, it 
also passed the Family and Offender Sentencing 
Act, which lets judges impose community custody 
for primary caregivers of minors in lieu of impris-
onment — a ruling where the convicted spends 
part of their sentence in the community instead 
of in prison.
In Michigan, nonprofits have been taking up 
the mantle where legislators fall short. Organiza-
tions such as the Oakland Livingston Human Ser-

vice Agency have spurred programs that allow incar-
cerated fathers to spend several hour-long visits with their 
children with room for activities.
Still, the barriers erected between the prisoners and 
their families exposes a cynical distrust of not only the 
incarcerated, but the relationships they have beyond pris-
on walls. States like Michigan could unburden families by 
creating policies that place prisoners in facilities that are 
closer to their homes.
However, the hardline policies comprise the central 
problem of an institutionalized, overcrowded prison 
industrial complex. These policies send prisoners away 
in every direction to a network of facilities that resembles 
something ecumenical in its disproportionate presence 
and outsize influence on communities.
Since the 1980s and 1990s, state and federal legislators 
have crafted policy such as habitual offender laws that 
mandatesentencing that includes life without parole, even 
if the offense is nonviolent. There are truth-in-sentencing 
laws, which eliminate the possibility for prisoners to be 
released on “good behavior.” There are the racist, seem-
ingly inexorable policies that disproportionately imprison 
Black and Latinx individuals, and the classist bail policies 
that favor the rich and ensure that those who cannot post 
bail remain indentured to the criminal justice system.
The problem with distance is inextricably tied to these 
esoteric policies long justified by the state and country to 
incarcerate as aimlessly as possible. If the U.S. didn’t have 
the highestincarceration rate in the world, perhaps seeing 
a loved one would not be such a formidable endeavor.

Ashley Lucas is one of the University’s most prominent 
voices on criminal justice reform. An associate professor 
of Theatre & Drama, she also directs the Prison Creative 
Arts Project, an organization run through the RC that cen-
ters around artistic collaboration between prisoners and 
students as a means of restorative justice. She has written 
extensively about the impacts of the criminal justice sys-
tem and moderated the most recent Carceral State Project 
Symposium panel.
Lucas spoke with me over the phone about the unend-
ing list of costs associated with communication between 
family members and their loved ones in prison. No matter 

the channel through which a family member may contact 
someone in prison, there is always some kind of payment 
associated with it. One company that prisons contract 
with for email services is JPay.
JPay is a private corporation that state and federal pris-
ons contract with to provide e-messaging services.
Despite the free email servers provided outside prison 
walls such as Gmail or Yahoo Mail, JPay users must pay 
“stamps,” which are electronic tokens that fluctuate in 
price, typically covering about a page of information for 
anywhere from 35 to 47 cents per page. Prisons receive a 
commission based on this spending. Lucas described how, 
often, prisoners or family members will send a message 
without any clear indicator of how much they will end up 
being charged to send it.
“When you’re typing into the email textbox on your 
screen (through JPay), you can’t actually see when you’ve 
crossed onto another page,” Lucas said.“So right after 
you send the email, it tells you how many digital stamps 
it’s going to charge you … But because you can’t see where 
the page starts and ends, you could be just one line of text 
over and they’ll go ahead and charge you for that page, 
but if you had known that then you would’ve been able to 
edit your letter down a line or two in order to make it not 
charge you more.”
Paying for these on a salary that is typically well below 
a dollar an hour ensures that prisoners have to be extra 
wary, and their family members may have to be the ones to 
pay more. However, as Lucas said, often the person incar-
cerated was the one providing the most consistent source 
of income for the family.
“When you lock someone up, you’re taking a person out 
of the lifecycle of a family,” she said. “You’re taking away 
a financial contributor, you’re taking away someone who 
provides childcare, eldercare, you’re taking away a sense 
of stability in the household.”
In an interview with Wired magazine, Holly Kramer, a 
communications representative for the Michigan Depart-
ment of Corrections, said, “Maintaining a positive net-
work of support is really important to their future success 
when they rejoin the community.” MDOC has contracted 
with JPay since 2009.
In the same article by Wired, Jade Trombetta, JPay’s 
senior manager, said, “Part of JPay’s mission is to pro-
vide technology … (that) empowers those individuals with 
access to educational tools and assists in their overall reha-
bilitation process.” However, when asked by Wired to dis-
cuss the reasoning behind payments or price fluctuation, 
she declined to comment.
JPay continues to be a central source for communicat-
ing with family members, proving that their model capi-
talizes off of this market specific to prisoners is lucrative. 
Prisons make a five cent commission off each message, 
which generated about $710,000for prisons in 2014. This 
continues to be profitable in Michigan, as 800,000 to 1 
million messages are sent a month. Should families choose 
an alternative, such as phone calling, they will have to 
pay about 20 cents per hour, which goes to JPay’s parent 
company, Securus. This is essentially extortion. Ironically, 
when Flores called me to conduct his interview, the pris-
on’s operator told me to hang up should he try to extort me.
The state budget for prison service that one would asso-
ciate with paying for these services does not have money 
allocated for these communications. This is despite the 
$1.95 billion allotted to MDOC, making up a fifth of Michi-
gan’s general fund. However, in the fall 2019 to 2020 list of 
appropriations, on which there were 21 changes in budget 
allocations, there was nothing regarding outside commu-
nications.
Even if prisoners are paying for their messages to be 
sent, correctional officers still peruse everything sent. 
Lucas spoke briefly about this, saying, “All the emails are 

still being read or censored or vetted by the prison mail 
room. It’s all being filtered through the prison for informa-
tion control before it sees the outside world.” Whatever is 
being sent, prison officials are entitled to read non-privi-
leged messages sent to and from facilities.
For those trying to keep in constant contact with the 
incarcerated family members, companies such as JPay and 
Securus ensure costly hurdles to communication. There 
seems to be little rationale for erecting such factitious 
monetary obstacles for something as crucial as maintain-
ing contact with those on the outside.

Family savings groan under the weight of institutional 
costs from incarceration even after the family member 
leaves prison, especially if it’s on parole. This issue is some-
thing Gourlay and Campbell were forced to familiarize 
themselves with after their son was released from prison.
“When you’re on parole, you have to pay specific fees 
every time you do something,” Campbell said. “There’s 
the supervision fee of $600. There’s the $50 a year fee. We 
spent probably, I’m guessing, over $25,000 in lawyers’ fees 
that our son use the appeals lawyer to get some things on 
his PSI changed.” A PSI is a pre-sentence investigation 
report and is used by judges when sentencing an offender. 
“And lo and behold, that was $775 that he had to pay back. 
You know, we didn’t even know that there was going to be a 
charge on that. You know it’s just one thing after another.”
In the case of their son, they mentioned they were lucky 
they could provide for these costs. However, for someone 
whose family may struggle in this regard, the likelihood 
of recidivism may increase. Probationers and parolees are 
often required to pay the costs for parole advisement, as 
well as for programs they may enter for drug treatment or 
rehabilitation after their time in prison.
Though the Constitution protects those who have 
exhibited indigence to the extent that they cannot pay 
whatsoever, those who demonstrate that they may have 
the means to pay are often required to do so.
In Massachusetts, there are 67,000 people on probation. 
They are charged $50 to $65 monthly, depending on their 
“tier” of probation, which is either supervised or admin-
istrative. Failure to pay these fees can result in jail time. 
These probation service fees total to over $20 million a 
year. This is just one state example of the laws states have 
put in place that have the potential to reincarcerate parol-
ees.
This becomes an issue for those wishing to re-enter 
society with a fresh start, something that is already 
impossible considering the numerous barriers that pro-
hibit those with criminal records from working. With new 
financial burdens to consider, recidivism becomes a more 
likely outcome.
This is something that causes Flores’ sister, Stefanie 
Veselaneck, frequent concern.
“I’m not sure how he’s going to look like, I don’t know 
how he’s going to feel about trying to go back to doing what 
he does, like painting and stuff,” she told me, her voice 
wobbly over the phone. “I don’t know. I just really worry 
about him getting out and not being able to adjust back to 
being an everyday, normal-life person.”
Despite the endless systemic pressures that supporting 
a loved one in prison entails, and the knowledge that even 
Flores’ release doesn’t mean the end of such concerns, 
Flores strives to be hopeful for his family. In a written let-
ter sent to his son Andrew for his 20th birthday, he wrote, 
“I’m sorry for having to have made it so you and nan are 
take (sic) care of me now. I know how expensive all of this 
is an (sic) trust me Andrew it means the world to me. With-
out everything you do I prob wouldn’t make it or struggle 
really bad … I will get out of here and change my ways and 
be by your side and be the dad/best friend I am supposed 
to be! You are my everything Andrew!”

“There seems to be 
little rationale for 
erecting such fac-
titious monetary 
obstacles for some-
thing as crucial as 
maintaining contact 
with those on the 
outside.”

F

or decades, Wall Street has been viewed as an 
antagonist of the American people. Banks are con-
tinuously under scrutiny for irresponsible money 
management, with the notorious Public Eye “Award” dishon-
ors frequently being bestowed upon them. This narrative was 
only solidified by the 2008 subpar mortgage crisis, largely 
credited to the Street’s blend of inadequate due diligence and 
austere greed. But now, data is the currency of our business 
world, and it is one that we pay forward to use free services 
like social media. Tech companies have taken on the pres-
sure that was once placed on Wall Street, and are now under 
the spotlight with an even larger obligation: using our credit 
card, address, contact info, social network, and purchase data 
responsibly.
One of the largest offenders of data irresponsibility is 
Facebook. While it is most known for its Cambridge Ana-
lytica data scandal, there is far more that may have missed 
major headlines. Let’s take a deep dive into what has 
happened over a tumultuous 12 months in Facebook’s 
rocky relationship with user data privacy:
March 2018: Facebook suspended Cambridge Ana-
lytica, a data analysis firm, when they violated Face-
book rules by collecting 87 million Americans’ data for 
hyper-targeted advertising, and lied to Facebook about 
deleting the data. Facebook had learned about the data 
collection back in 2015, but did not follow-up on the 
data deletion until 2018. The three-week aftermath 
of the news? An 18 percent drop in its stock price, the 
stepping down of former Security Chief Alex Stamos, 
and an FTC investigation. Although #deleteFacebook 
started trending nationwide, many started to realize 
that #TooBigToFail also applies to tech companies.
April 2018: “Senator, we run ads.” As Facebook’s 
stock began to recover, Facebook co-founder Mark 
Zuckerberg’s testimony in front of the Senate was filled 
with apologies and optimism for the firm. The company 
began taking action, too, revamping its privacy tools to 
allow users easy insight into the comprehensive data 
that Facebook has from them. The bad news? Zuck-
erberg isn’t the only one with problems on his hands. 
Regulators have a hefty task of figuring out how to cre-
ate legislation that can reign in an entity more powerful 
and complex than Congress itself.
Late April-May 2018: Deleting about 200 suspicious 
apps, 800plus million spam posts and rolling out an 
apology ad during the NBA Playoffs, Facebook began 
cleaning up its act. Apologies turned from words to 
action, as Facebook agreed to comply with the Europe-
an Union’s revolutionary data-privacy General Data Protec-
tion Regulation law.
June 2018: Spring cleaning, however, didn’t last long. June 
began with a New York Times accusation of Facebook shar-
ing excessive user data with device manufacturers like Apple, 
Microsoft, Samsung and BlackBerry. When users accessed 
Facebook on these devices, tech manufacturing firms alleg-
edly gained access to Facebook user data as well as users’ 
friends’ data. And when it rains, it pours: Days later, Facebook 
found a software bug that caused about 14 million private 
accounts to become public.
July 2018: Privacy stayed center stage for Facebook. The 
month kicked off with yet another apology from Zucker-
berg, as a six-day software bug that allowed blocked users to 
temporarily access and view the accounts of those who had 

blocked them. To wrap up the month, when dismal second 
quarter earnings revealed shockingly low revenue growth, 
Facebook saw the largest one-day loss in stock market his-
tory. The record-breaking abuse of data privacy had finally 
caught up to the company in a serious way.
October 2018: October wasted no time in spooking Face-
book. News surfaced that hackers were able to access 
information from roughly 29 million accounts — including 
Zuckerberg’s very own. Just six months after the Cambridge 
Analytica disaster, Facebook had once again found itself at 
odds with user data privacy. In hopes of making progress 
through tumult, Facebook made a bold move in their play-
book a week later, launching Facebook Portal: an in-home 
hardware device that functions like FaceTime, but with a 
wider screen and a camera that follows users during the call. 
With the chronic misuse of data preceding the launch, many 
viewed the in-home device with skepticism. And while still 

dealing with the data breach from the start of the month, 
Facebook announced a few days after the Portal launch that 
they had fixed a bug found in August that had allowed hack-
ers to hijack users’ WhatsApp accounts when they answered 
an incoming video call. By mid-October, major investors 
expressed their exhaustion with the company’s irresponsi-
bility, and called for Zuckerberg to step down from the com-
pany’s Board of Directors.
December 2018: Facebook wrapped up the year solidify-
ing itself as the enemy of responsible data utility when the 
Parliament of the United Kingdom released a slew of inter-
nal Facebook documents, revealing that Facebook created an 
entire marketplace with its user data. 
It gave companies such 
as Netflix, Microsoft and Amazon special access to Facebook 
user data, while limiting this database access to Facebook’s 

own competitors. Mid-December, Facebook continued what 
began to feel like empty apologies when they released news 
that a bug may have exposed unshared photos of roughly 7 
million users to up to 1,500 third-party apps. A few days after, 
Facebook received news that the Washington, D.C. attorney 
general, was finally suing the firm for the Cambridge Ana-
lytica data scandal.
January 2019: Mark Zuckerberg rang in the New Year with 
one resolution: fixing Facebook. But toward the end of the 
month, news broke that Facebook had been secretly paying 
people between the ages of 13 and 35 to install a “Facebook 
Research” VPN, letting the company acquire the entirety of a 
user’s web activity. The compensation? $20 per month. With-
in hours of the news breaking, Facebook shut down the iOS 
Facebook Research app. Despite the uneasy news, January 
concluded with a strong earnings report, sending the stock 
up nearly 12 percent.
February 2019: Facebook turned 15, but leaders 
worldwide were doing everything but celebrating. Ger-
man antitrust officials wielded their gavels and ordered 
Facebook to stop merging the data it collects on users’ 
activities across the internet without their consent. 
Weeks later, the UK Parliament released a 100 plus 
page document accusing Facebook of their beyond-the-
law behavior and recommended that the UK create a 
watchdog to oversee tech companies. Soon thereafter, 
New Zealand hinted at taxing multinational internet 
companies up to 3 percent.
March 2019: This month, while Facebook Coin is 
stirring conversation among cryptocurrency skeptics, 
Facebook made a colossal change to their blueprint that 
may just redefine the company as we know it: pivoting 
their strategy toward private communication. After 
a long year of broken privacy promises, this may look 
like a hollow tactic at face value. However, Zucker-
berg’s lengthy blog post begs to differ. He is revamping 
the company on one big bet: the movement from public 
posting to small-group sharing. What does this really 
mean? Perfecting the art of encrypted messaging.
While action is yet to follow his words, this new 
strategy ultimately means leveraging its less-than-ideal 
reputation in privacy, and strengthening it to the point 
of focal purpose. How do we know that this is the real 
deal? Just last Friday, Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief prod-
uct officer, stepped down, calling the shift a “big proj-
ect” that demands leaders who are “excited to see the 
new direction through.” As one of Facebook’s first 15 
engineers, it sounds like encryption didn’t sit too well 
with the executive.
The year 2018 was everything but kind to Facebook users, 
but the U.S. government is yet to properly penalize the tech 
mogul. While data privacy is a direct issue that all users equi-
tably seek resolve from, the fact of the matter is that lawmak-
ers and the FTC do not have the resources to suitably regulate 
companies of such massive size. The FTC’s largest fine to 
date is $22.5 million, charged back in 2011 to Google after the 
company tracked userson Apple Safari without their consent. 
For a multi-billion dollar company, this is less than a slap on 
the wrist.
For now, users and legislators can only hold out hope that 
the move to private communication is a move toward data 
responsibility on Facebook’s chessboard.
