The Michigan Senate passed 

legislation last week allowing 
licensed gun owners to carry 
concealed 
handguns 
inside 

schools, churches, bars and other 
traditionally gun-free zones.

Bill 584 is a part of a three-bill 

package that will now move to the 
state House of Representatives 
after passing almost completely 
along party lines with a 25-to-12 
vote.

The vote came three days after 

a mass shooting in Sutherland 
Spring, Texas, causing some to 
suspect Senate Republicans fast-
tracked the bill to take advantage 
of the urgency of the tragedy. 
Considering 
the 
context 
of 

multiple mass shootings in the 
United States this year, Senate 
Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, 
R-West Olive, who introduced the 
bill, said these events make the 
bill’s passing more relevant.

“I believe citizens have the 

right to be free and safe and 
secure and to defend themselves 
and their loved ones. Responsible, 
well-trained, licensed gun owners 
may be one of those deterrents to 
those individuals who seek out 
gun-free zones as opportunities 
to 
commit 
heinous 
crimes,” 

Meekhof said, as reported in The 
Washington Post.

However, 
the 
bill 
faced 

emotional backlash. As reported 
by the Detroit Free Press, state 
Sen. Rebekah Warren, D-Ann 
Arbor, 
said 
other 
concealed 

weapons carriers do little to help 
in mass shooting incidents and 
shouldn’t be used to justify the 
bill.

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel, 
communications 

director of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats, agreed with Warren 
and said Meekhof’s logic is 
misguided.

“This legislation is both poorly 

timed and poorly conceived,” 

Schandeval said. “The idea that 
more guns in prohibited areas will 
help prevent mass shootings has 
been prevalent in our legislature 
for some time, and it is sorely 
misguided.”

Though Democrats nicknamed 

the bill “Pistols in Preschools,” 
Linda 
Brundage, 
executive 

director of the Michigan Coalition 
to Prevent Gun Violence, said 
there will also be adverse effects 
on college campuses.

“Students need to be worried,” 

Brundage said. “Students go 
to bars, students go to large 
stadiums, other venues. I mean, 
it is an issue, and it will just stifle 
intellectual development, I think, 
in a lot of different ways. And 
suicide is very high among the 
college-age population.”

Before starting his freshman 

year at the University of Michigan, 
LSA sophomore Cooper Kirby 
asked himself if college was 
truly something he wanted to do. 
Luckily, he later found a way to 
balance academics and his interest 
in fashion, and has just released a 
new clothing brand this year.

“It’s been tough to juggle with 

school work, but it’s been great,” 
Kirby said.

Kirby and his close friend Ryan 

Murray, a sophomore at Michigan 
State 
University, 
co-founded 

Lakeshore 
Drive, 
a 
clothing 

brand and company that works to 
promote “individuality and living 
your best life.”

“We wanted to project this idea 

to our audience through living 
your Lakeshore Drive,” Kirby said. 
“Your lakeshore is your paradise, 
it’s a place you’d always rather be 
or anything you’d always rather 
be doing, and your drive is what 
always pushes you further, it’s 
going to keep you going.

The Michigan Daily: So 

we’ll start with one of the most 
relevant issues — last night, the 
Central Student Government 
Divestment Resolution passed. 
To begin, where do you go from 
here? There are a lot of students 
saying this motion will increase 
tensions on campus. How do you 
mitigate these tensions in the 
wake of this resolution and the 
events of the past year, especially 
when some students feel as if 
they are being targeted?

Royster: 
So, 
I’ve 
been 

thinking about a couple of 
things — one, it’s interesting to 
me that we start with the rock, 
that targets Latinx students, we 
start with the national climate 
that targets everybody, it’s just 
who’s in the queue to be targeted, 
and then we have our own 
experience on our campus, so 
far no one has been missed. And 
then we have our own internal 
conversations and debates about, 
really, a really complex issue. 

It’s the same kind of debate 
about a complex issue about 
controversial speakers — who 
should be on campus — so if our 
values around free speech, what 
we find right now is that we have 
another set of issues, contest, 
divestment, that is in the center 
of what we say as an institution 
we’re committed to … which is 
free speech, multiple points of 
view — sometimes that speech 
targets 
and 
hurts 
different 

communities. So I’ve been struck 
by when you pull out content, 
the tension for us has really 
been about when we have these 
areas that we fundamentally 
disagree about, we just don’t 
have a lot of experience debating 
the issue without hurting the 
relationships. And so whether 
it’s Richard Spencer, same issue, 
it’s the content, multiple points of 
view about the content, and same 
challenge — how do we engage in 
that decision without hurting our 
community and our relationship?

“Ain’t I a woman?”: Laverne Cox 
discusses influences, experiences

ALEC COHEN/Daily

Laverne Cox shares her college experience as part of the 2017 CEW Spectrum of Advocay and Activism Symposium in Rackham Wednesday.

U-M Vice President of Student Life

Star of “Orange is the New Black” encourages student protest of Richard Spencer

Delivering personal messages 

of hope and empowerment for the 
future to University of Michigan 
students was “Orange is the New 
Black” star Laverne Cox, who took 
the stage of Rackham Auditorium 
Wednesday night.

Over 300 people gathered 

to watch Cox, a transgender, 
African-American 
actress 
and 

activist, 
deliver 
her 
speech 

“Ain’t I a Woman? My Journey 

to Womanhood” to conclude the 
2017 Center for the Education of 
Women Spectrum of Advocacy 
and 
Activism 
Symposium. 

Hundreds more tuned into the 
livestream of the speech, shown at 
various locations around campus.

Before the event, due to its 

popularity, students gave out their 
tickets to Black women on campus 
so those who could benefit most 
from listening to Cox could take 
advantage of the opportunity to 
hear her.

 “It’s a horrible thing that you 

don’t expect people to support you, 

but being Black on this campus, 
you don’t expect it because of the 
way that a lot people act and what 
a lot of people do — you just don’t 
expect people to care,” LSA junior 
Mayah Wheeler said in October 
regarding the generosity of ticket 
givers.

Anna Kirkland, director of the 

Institute for Research on Women 
and Gender, began the night by 
describing the unusual political 
circumstances of the past year — 
especially pertaining to women’s 
rights.

“It has been an extraordinary 

year to be a scholar of gender in 
this country, and by that I mean 
well beyond the ordinary, and not 
in the sense of good,” she said. 
“Laverne Cox sits here when we 
need her most.”

Cox spent a large portion of her 

speech describing her childhood 
in Mobile, Ala., and the various 
experiences that have influenced 
her identity as a transgender 
Black woman.

Avomeen Holdings LLC, the 

chemical testing business is suing 
founder Shri Thanedar in federal 
court for making “fraudulent and 
misleading” claims regarding 
his company’s revenues to inflate 
the value of its sale. Thanedar, 
a University of Michigan alum 
and Democratic gubernational 
candidate, sold his controlling stake 
earlier this month, seven years after 
he founded the company, according 
to a report by the The Detroit News.

The complaint alleges Thanedar 

overstated the company’s monthly 
revenue, directed employees to 
reduce large fluctuations in the 
month-to-month figures and lied 
about the methods his company 
used to record revenue.

“However, purchaser has 

discovered … that in the critical 
months leading up to close, 
Thanedar made fraudulent and 
misleading representations to 
purchaser regarding Avomeen’s 
financial practices and the 
nature and amount of Avomeen’s 
monthly revenues and earnings. 

In essence, Thanedar falsely 
portrayed Avomeen as an entity 
with consistent, growing month-to-
month revenue during the critical 
period leading up to Purchaser’s 
investment transaction,” the 
lawsuit reads.

Thanedar denied the 

lawsuit’s allegations in a text to a 
reporter from The Detroit News 
but declined to make further 
comment.

“I patently deny every claim 

contained in this document and 
intend to fight it. Because this 
is a pending legal matter, I am 
prohibited from saying more at 
this time,” Thanedar wrote in a 
statement. 

Thanedar received 

approximately $20 million from 
the sale of his majority interest 
in the company to the Chicago-
based equity firm High Street 
Capital, retaining a minority 
interest through his company 
Chemreal.

Thanedar’s knack for business 

has figured prominently in his 

campaign rhetoric. In 2016, he made 
headlines for giving $1.5 million 
in bonuses to his employees, and 
was named Ernst and Young’s 

Entrepreneur of the Year.

ON THE DAILY: SHRI THANEDAR FACES FRAUD ALLEGATIONS

On Wednesday, students came 

to campus to learn clinical skills, 
such as how to calculate heart 
rate, listen to a heartbeat through 
a stethoscope and test one 
another’s reflexes. The students 
jumped at the opportunity to 
answer every question, and were 
eager to engage with the medical 
students conducting the lessons.

These 
weren’t 
traditional 

college 
students, 
however; 

instead these were 35 students 
from 
Cass 
Technical 
High 

School in Detroit who came to 
the University of Michigan as 
part of the Doctors of Tomorrow 
initiative. About once a month, 
the students come to meet 
with their mentors, learn about 
different parts of medical school 

and participate in hands-on 
interactive activities.

Doctors of Tomorrow was 

started in 2012 by University 
surgeon 
Jonathan 
Finks. 

Finks said it stemmed out of a 
realization that there is a lack 
of diversity in the Medical 
School and particularly a lack 
of students from Detroit. After 
investigating, Finks and his team 
found African Americans made 
up only 6 percent of the Medical 
School class.

“Medical 
schools 
across 

the 
country 
work 
hard 
to 

attract talented students from 
underrepresented groups, but 
the problem is that for students 
from underrepresented areas, 
often it can be hard to get into 
college, hard to do well, hard to 
stay in college,” Finks said. “And 
so we try to reach kids when they 
are younger through a program 

of 
mentorship 
and 
clinical 

enrichment, and try to get them 
to the point where we can try to 
get them to come to Michigan 
as sort of a pipeline program, 
continue to mentor them while 
they’re here and eventually help 
those who are interested get into 
medical school.”

The high school students, 

who are selected through a 
competitive application process 
by members of the DoT team 
from the University of Michigan 
as well as faculty at Cass Tech, 
are each paired with one or two 
first-year Medical students.

Each month, the students 

learn 
something 
different 

at their visits — everything 
from learning how to take 
blood pressure to shadowing 
physicians. They also participate 
in a capstone project, where they 
work on a health issue such as 

nutrition or youth violence 
and try to come up with 
a project they can do to 
help solve it. The students 
work 
in 
conjunction 

with 
community 
service 

organizations in Detroit on 
their capstones.

Since the high school 

students are also freshman, 
the program is one of near-
peer mentoring, as Adrianne 
Haggins, who conducted a 
study on the DoT program, 
explained. Haggins said the 
mentors and the mentees 
found the program to be 
incredibly rewarding and 
helpful.

“The high school students 

appreciated the consistent 
contact that they were able 
to achieve, despite the fact 
that medical students are 
typically very busy, as well 
as the high school students 
being busy taking care of 
their own academic work,” 
Haggins said.

BEGINNINGS

The 
Black-Asian 
Coalition 

was started in January 2015. 
Sean Dajour Smith, a class of 
2017 alum, and Sarah Hong, a 
class of 2016 alum, connected 
through their community action 
and social change minor and 
their shared interest in coalition 
building. Sarah wanted to create 
a space where members of the 
Asian Pacific Islander American 
community could confront anti-
Blackness. Smith, on the other 
hand, thought it could be an 
opportunity to link people who 
did not necessarily interact daily.

“We just wanted to get friends 

in 
the 
room 
who 
wouldn’t 

normally be in the room together,” 
he said. “It started as a Black-Asian 
solidarity conversation.”

The first meeting was held 

in February 2016 at the Shapiro 
Undergraduate 
Library, 
and 

the initiative grew from there. 
Intentionality in building the 
space became a deeply rooted 
value from the beginning, even 
with the naming of the group. “One 
of the things that Sean mentioned 
was when he organized before he 
came to U-M, other people would 
call and use the Black community 
when it was helpful for them, but 
never reciprocated the effort,” 
Hong said. “So we wanted it to be 
intentional that this is a space for 
addressing the anti-Blackness that 
exists within our community.”

The coalition was a success. 

They met six times during that 
semester, with roughly 50 total 
attendees. However, when Hong 
graduated in May 2016, the BAC 
disappeared for a short time.
PHASE TWO

The BAC would never have 

restarted if not for a chance 
encounter. While walking across 
the Diag, Smith ran into a friend, 
Sean Liu, a class of 2016 alum, 
who wanted him to restart the 
BAC. Smith was reluctant to 
begin meetings without an Asian 
co-organizer, but Liu persuaded 
him to reach out to a friend of his, 
Business senior Chelsea Racelis.

While Smith initially felt unsure 

about a new partner, he was blown 

away upon meeting Racelis. He 
believed she valued the same 
principles of intentionality and 
coalition-building he did. Seeking 
one 
more 
facilitator, 
Smith 

approached LSA junior Zainab 
Bhindarwala about joining the 
coalition as an organizer. Drawn in 
by the concept, Bhindarwala was 
also swayed by the “strong sense 
of purpose and urgency” displayed 
by Smith and Racelis. After their 
initial meeting, they met several 
times to plan and build the space 
as intentionally as possible.
ORGANIZING 
THROUGH 

RELATIONSHIPS

At the University of Michigan, 

community 
organizing 
is 

most 
often 
associated 
with 

structured organizing and mass 
mobilization. The BAC takes a 
different approach. From their 
organizing 
experiences, 
the 

founders believed there was a lack 
of spaces dedicated to fostering 
relationships between different 
groups of people. They also wanted 
to create a space where people 
would feel energized instead of 
the burnout often associated with 
social justice. These principles 
led to the BAC’s focus on face-to-
face interaction and sustainable 
change that persists after the 
emotional high from the latest 
rally. 

“Once you see people affected 

of those you hold dear and near, 
your views on a lot of things can 
shift,” Smith said, “and you start to 
fight because you have that sense 
of accountability for others.”

LSA junior Kortez Brinson, 

a BAC participant, also stated 
the 
importance 
of 
creating 

connection. Prior to attending the 
University, he was an organizer in 
the Mikva Challenge Foundation 
and Chicago Student Union. There, 
he sought similar community-
organizing experiences and the 
BAC fit that need.

“To me, a lot of the organizing at 

the University has a lot of emotion 
in it, a lot of structure, almost 
too much structure,” he said. “In 
the BAC, we’re focused more on 
coming into this room and getting 
back to what organizing is. A 
lot of what that is is getting into 
communities, coming together 
and networking with a bunch of 
people we don’t know.”

The BAC believes that by 

bringing two unlike groups into 
a room together, it can create 

friendships, 
and 
from 
there 

inspire these two groups to build 
coalition together. Instead of 
focusing on the growth of the 
coalition, 
Smith, 
Racelis 
and 

Bhindarwala care more about the 
growth of individuals.

“We created a centralized space 

so individuals could have a context 
to connect with one another,” 
Smith said.

In building these individual 

relationships, they hope that it 
will encourage them to support 
one another. This idea is rooted 
in the notion that if the BAC 
stops existing, these individual 
relationships will continue to 
persist.

“When you get a Black student 

and an Asian student that feel 
comfortable and willing to hit each 
other up just for a conversation, 
you officially can say you’re 
successful,” Brinson said. “From 
these connections, you get passion 
and understanding between each 
other that can make change in 
society.”
INTENTIONALITY

Instead of advertising, the 

group relies on word of mouth 
and personal networks to bring 
new people into the space. It 
believes that it shouldn’t have to 
persuade people to come to this 
space because it believes people 
should feel compelled to come to 
this space on their own beliefs and 
morals — things that BAC doesn’t 
want to influence.

“We don’t need to convince 

anyone to come, because if we 
need to convince someone, then 
that person isn’t intrinsically 
motivated to engage with the 
space,” Racelis said.

While 
unconventional, 
the 

technique seems to be working. 
More than 60 people were at 
the last meeting and half had 
never been there before. This has 
become a common theme since 
the first meeting last January. 
Rather than the same set of people 
attending, from the experiences of 
Michigan in Color’s interviewees, 
more often than not, a majority of 
the room is filled with strangers.

When 
organizing 
meetings, 

the three focus on intentionality 
and inclusivity. Every decision is 
chosen to meet their overarching 
goals of combating anti-Blackness 
and remaining accessible for all. 

“We held a session about 

colorism and that was good 

because 
it 
affects 
multiple 

communities in different ways, 
but it also has global reach,” 
Bhindarwala said. “It comes up in 
very different ways in Black and 
Asian communities, but everyone 
there could relate.”

However, intentionality should 

not be confused with structure. 
While the three are deliberate 
in their actions, they try not to 
impose their agendas in the space. 
They intentionally build a space 
with the hopes of producing 
organic conversations.
WHY THE BAC MATTERS

For many participants, like 

Music, Theatre & Dance senior 
Stone Stewart, the BAC is a unique 
space on campus. It is a chance to 
hang out with friends, meet new 
people and deepen understanding 
of others’ experiences.

“If someone told me that I was 

about to go to this social function 
with 90 strangers, then I would 
have no reason to go,” Stewart 
said, “but it works with BAC.”

“A lot of people want to have 

diverse friend groups, but it 
can be hard to reach out and it 
can be awkward,” Bhindarwala 
said. “Being in the same space 
at the same time can stop this 
segregation.”

Black and Asian students learn 

from one another — an intentional 
construct. In other spaces, Black 
students 
are 
often 
expected 

to teach others about systemic 
oppression — an emotionally 
draining process that can dissuade 
Black students from returning.

“We recognize that when Black 

people are entering the space, 
they feel like they might have to 
be educators as Asian folks are 
trying to decolonize their own 
anti-Blackness,” 
Bhindarwala 

said. “We put emphasis on making 
sure that Black folks don’t feel like 
educators.”

This space fosters learning 

and encourages each group to 
engage with the other. With the 
understanding these two groups 
come into this space with largely 
different purposes, there is a 
common understanding that this 
is a space to engage and to build 
relationships with each other 
in hopes for them to separately 
collaborate outside the BAC. To 
Stewart, he believes this space is 
“so fundamentally human and it’s 
all about building that genuine 
connection with others.”

Yet this space is special in 

which these two groups come 
together for many reasons, one 
of them being to learn about how 
these two cultures interact.

“Whether we realize it or not, 

Black and Asians take a lot from 
each other, good or for bad,” 
Stewart said. “Most of the time we 
just aren’t interacting.”

There was a general sentiment 

held by the participants about the 
necessity for this space on campus. 
In the dominant narrative, Blacks 
and Asians are often used against 
each other in order to invalidate 
the struggles of Blacks in the 
United States. Interviewees from 
both racial groups felt that same 
tension. Stewart, who identifies as 
biracial (Japanese and Caribbean), 
said, “I think Black and Asian 
people and the way we are 
portrayed in society are at such 
odds with each other.” Brinson, 
who is Black, shared a similar 
sentiment, saying: “I believe there 
is a lot of tension between Black 
and Asian students. Not even 
naturally, more so that there are 
forces pushing the tension.”

This has ripple effects and often 

influences how these two groups 
are raised and taught to view each 
other.

“The overall goal (of BAC) is 

that if we’re in a neighborhood 
together, I’m comfortable enough 
going up to an Asian family and 
saying, ‘Hello, how you doin’?’ I 
want my kids to kick it with their 
kids, to actually have a good time 
with them,” Brinson said. “We’re 
still both minorities, we’re still 
both working hard to establish a 
foundation in this world, but we 
are not enemies, and we are not 
competing against each other.”
THE FUTURE

As the BAC continues to grow, 

so do the organizers.

“Doing BAC and even just being 

with Sean and Zainab has taught 
me a lot about organizing,” Racelis 
said. “You can organize from a 
place of real love, and now I like 
surrounding myself with those 
people.”

This idea of organizing from a 

compassionate place was reiterated 
in our interview with Hong as well 
who said: “We have that call-out 
culture in social justice, but we 
shouldn’t be shaming people in 
that way, (but) because (BAC) is 
so open and willing to listen, we 
are more peaceful and willing.” 

Organizing from a place of love 
and compassion is also evident 
with how BAC participants engage 
with the space. BAC participants 
have reiterated how they enjoy 
being in this space beca

use it’s where participants feel 

empowered to bring their full 
selves to every meeting.

Additionally, 
the 
organizers 

are working to incorporate the 
feedback and needs of the BAC’s 
participants.

“People want opportunities to 

be together. Now we realize once 
a month isn’t enough to meet,” 
Racelis said. “Many ask if it’s every 
Saturday, and now we have a lot of 
momentum. We want to facilitate 
different ways for people to come 
together. Whether through movie 
nights, potlucks, etc.”

Racelis 
spoke 
about 
how 

members haven’t even touched the 
majority of the content that they 
discussed when initially building 
this space. 

During our interviews with 

Smith, Racelis and Bhindarwala, 
they 
spoke 
about 
Smith’s 

metaphor for the BAC. He often 
compares this space to an airport: 
“We wanted focus more on the 
individuals. We wanted to build 
everything on the ground and 
then (let them) take flight, rather 
than building while in the air.” 
The idea behind this metaphor is 
there is power in facilitating the 
context for these individuals to 
interact with while they’re in the 
same space. Participants in the 
BAC are often active members 
of their own communities and 
student organizations. Each of 
these student organizations and 
individuals can be seen as a plane 
that comes into the BAC. They land 
for an hour, develop relationships, 
re-energize themselves, connect 
on a humane level and then leave 
once the hour is done. In hope, 
BAC works to use this hour as an 
incubator for building meaningful 
relationships across these groups 
that will persist outside of the 
BAC.

The 
BAC 
organizers 

continuously emphasize that this 
space is temporary. BAC may exist 
now, but in a few years, it may not. 
Knowing this, the organizers hope 
that they foster a space conducive 
for these individual relationships 
to flourish and persist, and that 
the relationships and mindsets 
created will last for a lifetime.

One day in 1975, 21-year-old 

Giang Lê decided to skip class 
for the first time. He sat outside 
his dormitory at Van Hanh 
University in Saigon with a few 
friends when a car suddenly 
braked in front of them. Giang’s 
mother signaled from the car 
and told him to pack — a choice 
that would change his life 
forever.

It was the spring of 1975 and 

the Vietnam War was coming 
to a close, with a northern 
communist victory in sight. 
Giang’s family of 10 had lived 
through most of it, including 
the Summer of Flames, a series 
of communist attacks in 1972. 

“It wasn’t unusual to go 

to school and hear someone 
had gotten killed,” he said. 
As 
class 
president, 
Giang 

organized 
strikes, 
but 
was 

wary of classmates who were 
“undercover informants for the 
communists. They would try 
to drive demonstrations away 
from our goals, turning into 
anti-American protests.”

Three of Giang’s brothers 

were studying abroad in the 
United 
States 
while 
Giang 

stayed 
in 
Vietnam. 
Only 

students 
who 
passed 
the 

Baccalaureate with top honors 
could apply to college overseas, 
something Giang credits to 
school 
shutdowns. 
Failing 

students were drafted.

Staying 
behind 
was 
an 

enlightening 
experience 
for 

Giang.

“It allowed me to see the real 

Vietnam,” he said. “I had the 
opportunity to participate in 

leadership with my fraternity 
and do a lot of charity work. 
My brothers, who lived only in 
Hue and Da Nang, didn’t know 
what the rest of the country 
was like.”

However, Giang’s mother, 

Nhan, knew the family had 
to 
flee 
the 
violence 
and 

destruction. 
To 
persuade 

her 
adamant 
husband, 
she 

said they were just going to 
visit their sons abroad. “She 
was very street smart,” he 
said. At the airport, Nhan 
carried Vietnamese embassy 
papers 
with 
the 
family’s 

identifications. She folded the 
letterhead to make the papers 
look like official American 
documents and waved them 
in front of police, who were 
overwhelmed with hundreds of 
desperate people. “This was a 
turning point,” Giang revealed. 
“We left and I had $1 in my 
pocket.”

Leaving 
Vietnam 
also 

presented 
a 
complexity 
of 

emotion. 
Initially, 
Giang’s 

family was ecstatic to escape. 
But, “It was a very sad day. 
I felt like I betrayed my 
country and my friends. They 
were giving students guns, 
preparing 
for 
bloodbath. 
I 

knew we were losing the war 
to 
the 
communists. 
They 

were barbaric; I was sure 
many friends would die. I had 
organized funerals for their 
families. I can’t believe I did 
that. I never cried until the 
end. After we landed in the 
Philippines, I couldn’t speak 
for 
days.” 
The 
Vietnamese 

government 
announced 

surrender to the North soon 
after.

From 
there, 
Giang 
went 

to Guam for a few months, 
then a camp near Panama 
City. He barely knew English. 
He 
contacted 
his 
brothers 

and stayed in Middletown, 
Conn. After settling down, 
Giang graduated from Central 
Connecticut State University 
with a bachelor’s in accounting.

Embracing America, Giang’s 

late parents gave back to the 
community and created cultural 
touchstones for the Vietnamese 
population, opening a local 
grocery store, video store and 

establishing Hai An Pagoda, a 
Buddhist temple, where Giang 
is now president.

Today, Giang lives in Darien, 

Conneticut with his wife and 
daughters. He is a corporate 
vice president at New York 
Life. Though Giang leads a 
very successful life, he never 
forgets his past and how hard 
his parents worked. 

“I will always try to do 

community 
work 
and 
help 

others. My me always said it 
doesn’t matter if you go to a 
big school and get prestigious 
degrees, it’s what you do for 
society that counts.”

The Black-Asian Coalition: Past, present, and future

VALERIE LÊ
MiC Contributor

November is Puerto Rican 

Heritage Month, a time to 
acknowledge the past, act in 
the present and hope for the 
future. In the aftermath of 
Hurricane Maria, we have 
been wrestling with feelings of 
guilt, despair and anger. Guilt 
for not being there, despair 
with feeling useless and anger 
with institutional apathy. For 
all the people who have felt 
this way, this is for you. We 
write this in honor of those 
who are on the island, of those 
came before us, of those who 
are hopeful, of those who are 
fighting across seas and still 
loving the same island que nos 
dió a luz — that gave birth to 
us, that brought us light. 

Too often news clips and 

press releases fail to capture 
the way Puerto Ricans feel 
in their own words, so we 
interviewed six Puerto Rican 
women who are defining for 
themselves what it means to 
be Puerto Rican. Being Puerto 
Rican has never been, is and 
will never be a monolith of 
experience, 
but 
one 
thing 

connecting us is how we carry 
Puerto Rico, and that which 
came before us, in our hearts. 
This is our story in our words.

When we were young our 

mothers would say, “Te las 
arreglaste para nacer en una 
isla,” “You figured out a way to 
be born on an island.” Not the 
island of Puerto Rico, but the 
island of Manhattan (Gloriela) 
and Hawaii (Angélica). Despite 
this poetic coincidence, we 
often found ourselves feeling 
inadequate. 
We 
wanted 
to 

be born on that island, not 
this one. We longed to be 

surrounded by the sounds and 
smells that enveloped us and 
let us know we were home. 
When 
asked 
what 
Puerto 

Rico means to her, Yomaira 
Figueroa, assistant professor 
of Afro diaspora studies in the 
departments of English and 
African American and African 
Studies 
at 
Michigan 
State 

University, said, “This island … 
that is both a homeland and an 
impossibility. … I am so proud 
of our diasporic histories and 
how we have cleaved to ‘home’ 
across generations and against 
structures and policies that 
were created to sever these 
ties.”

So how do we strengthen our 

ties? Our struggle to reconcile 

responsibility 
and 
respect, 

of dancing the lines between 
insider and outsider, reflect 
the consequences of colonial 
policies governing Puerto Rico, 
wherein Puerto Ricans living 
in 
the 
continental 
United 

States have greater political say 
than those on the island. Given 
these geographic and political 
dynamics, how can we engage 
respectfully with our island 
counterparts? Where do we 
go from here? Recognizing the 
poderosas (powerful women) 
already doing the work feels 
like a great start. The women’s 
voices 
woven 
throughout 

this 
article 
exemplify 
the 

different and beautiful ways 

Boricuas are empowering each 
other to continue reclaiming, 
remapping and rebuilding our 
beloved Borinkén.

María Levis Peralta, founder 

of consulting firm Impactivo, 
spoke about the importance 
of 
leveraging 
our 
political 

opportunities: “Puerto Rico 
has one nonvoting member in 
Congress. This means that at 
the federal-level Puerto Rico 
only 
has 
advocacy 
power. 

Thankfully, our power is more 
expansive than many realize. 
Puerto Ricans in the diaspora 
are one of the most powerful 
tools we have to make our 
voices 
heard 
in 
Congress. 

Congress members listen to 
their constituents and we must 
utilize our political power to 
advocate for our island and 
its future.” We are already 
powerful and through our 
relationships with each other, 
we are empowered to make 
change.

Through 
teaching 

students about the real-life 
consequences of colonialism 
— 
like 
Delia 
Fernandez, 

a 
professor 
of 
history 
at 

Michigan 
State 
University 

— the work and voices of 
Boricua’s 
communities 
are 

able to highlight the political 
fortitude 
of 
ancestors 
and 

elders who taught us how to 
remain resilient in the face 
of oppression. During Puerto 
Rican Heritage Month, we are 
ecstatic to celebrate Boricuas 
who are using their voices and 
stories to disrupt disparaging 
narratives about Puerto Ricans 
and improve the lives of those 
on the island and those in 
the 
diaspora. 
Remembering 

Figueroa’s words, “I am bound 
up with my kin, ancestors and 
communities on our island and 
in diaspora,” our futures are 
linked and we women are the 
ones whom we are waiting for.

This is our story 

in our words

It’s what you do 
for society that 

counts


I 

was invited to a bar crawl this 
past weekend. Though I love 
Charley’s, The Brown Jug and 

Rick’s, the thought of going to each 
in quick succession 
made 
me 
anxious. 

I tried to do a quick 
mental 
calculation 

of how much mixed 
drinks, beer and cover 
from each bar would 
cost me. The number 
was intimidating.

Having 
a 
social 

life at this university 
is 
expensive. 
Bar 

covers, drinks, tickets 
to movies and concerts, Ubers and 
dinners at Ann Arbor’s many fine 
restaurants are not kind to student 
budgets. However, the alternative 
is often staying in alone while 
your friends have a blast. At the 
least 
socioeconomically 
diverse 

public university in the nation, this 
phenomenon is especially disturbing.

If the University of Michigan 

is to become a place where people 
of all incomes feel welcome, 
wealthier students should be more 
conscious of their peers’ ability to 
pay when making social plans.

The median annual parental 

income 
is 
$154,000, 
three 

times the Michigan average. 
A full two-thirds of students 
come from the top 20 percent 
of national incomes, while less 
than 4 percent come from the 
bottom 20 percent of incomes. 
Perhaps most depressingly, the 
University ranks last out of all 
public universities in terms of 
economic mobility for students.

The University’s predominance 

of wealthy students naturally 
breeds a campus culture in 
which money is often taken for 
granted. And even if the University 
admitted more low- and middle-
income students, would they even 
want to stay in an environment 
where social pressures encourage 
nonstop spending?

The 
University’s 
tuition 

partially 
explains 
this 

exclusivity. In-state tuition has 
been consistently rising and 
now sits at $14,826. Consistently 
decreasing state funding has 
encouraged 
the 
University 

to 
accept 
more 
out-of-state 

students 
who 
pay 
sky-high 

tuitions. 
Furthermore, 
Ann 

Arbor’s housing costs are a 
full 73 percent higher than the 
national average. Add books 

and miscellaneous costs to the 
equation, 
and 
attending 
the 

University costs $29,526, if you’re 
lucky enough to live in-state. 

That’s about two-thirds 
of the average Michigan 
household income. The 
University social scene 
shouldn’t require low- 
and 
middle-income 

students to shell out 
enormous 
amounts 

of cash on top of the 
already 
exorbitant 

costs of attendance.

A 
number 
of 

factors contribute to 

the University’s overly classist 
social scene. First, it seems as if 
almost every social event requires 
attending one of Ann Arbor’s 
often costly dining, drinking or 
entertainment 
establishments. 

Going to a friend’s birthday dinner 
at Sava’s, seeing Mac DeMarco 
perform at Hill Auditorium and 
buying a movie ticket for the 
Michigan Theater each costs a 
lot of money. Nightlife further 
squeezes one’s budget. The two 
most popular bars on campus, 
Rick’s and Scorekeepers, charge 
covers to get in and offer pricey 
drink menus. Even the ubiquitous 
coffee date at Espresso Royale or 
Starbucks requires a few bucks 
for a latte. Students build their 
social lives around activities at 
these 
establishments; 
almost 

every date, get-together or night 
out with friends comes with a 
high cash premium.

Some institutional features 

of 
the 
campus 
social 
scene 

further exclude students of lower 
socioeconomic status. Institutions 
like Greek life and club sports 
charge entry dues or require 
expensive gear to participate. 
Additionally, the time commitment 
of 
these 
activities 
precludes 

some 
who 
participate 
from 

working part-time jobs. These 
organizations play a large role in 
the campus social scene — they are 
an easy place to make friends and 
often host large parties.

I recognize many of these 

organizations 
offer 
financial 

assistance. 
However, 
the 

monetary barriers may still prove 
prohibitive to many students 
of lower socioeconomic status. 
Because financial barriers exclude 
many less wealthy students, these 
organizations 
help 
maintain 

physical and social separation 

between the University’s wealthy 
and 
less 
well-off 
students. 

Furthermore, these organizations’ 
exclusivity is especially harmful 
to economic mobility given their 
facilitation of beneficial personal 
connections to successful peers 
and alumni. Unequal access to 
these institutions only further 
isolates poorer students from 
campus social activities.

When students miss event after 

event, maintaining friendships on 
campus becomes very difficult. It 
can be embarrassing to admit you 
can’t get dinner because your bank 
account can’t weather it. I know 
I’ve told friends I couldn’t make 
it to an event when I really just 
couldn’t afford it at the moment. 
Missing 
these 
social 
events 

means missing crucial moments 
of friendship. 

Other everyday realities on 

campus also exclude students of 
lower socioeconomic status from 
the 
University’s 
social 
scene. 

The most obvious is housing. As 
a recent Daily survey indicates, 
students of lower economic status 
tend to live farther from campus, 
and students with more money 
tend to live closer to campus, 
restaurants and bars. High rents 
and simple geography give richer 
students easy access to the popular 
hangout spots in the city. With 
the recent crop of luxury student 
high-rises that cost up to $1,999 a 
month, rich students can live, quite 
literally, on top of the bars.

I recognize that many students 

frequently enjoy social activities 
that require virtually no money, 
such as watching Netflix with 
friends or hanging out in the Arb. 
Additionally, I’m not arguing all 
students should swear off Skeep’s 
forever and live as hermits. I 
only ask that wealthier students 
become a little more conscientious 
when asking friends out to dinner, 
concerts and the bar. Perhaps a 
night out could be swapped for 
a movie night at home, a concert 
could be swapped for a trip to the 
UMMA and a fancy dinner could 
be swapped for a homemade 
meal 
with 
friends. 
These 

activities may not solve the 
University’s diversity problem, 
but they may make the University 
just a little more inclusive for 
students of lower incomes.

Why minimize?

JOSIE TOLIN | COLUMN

W

hile I’m no modern 
lifestyle 
guru, 

I 
have 
in 
fact 

noticed 
the 
frequent 
use 

of 
the 
qualifier 

“minimalist” 
as 

an antecedent for 
many of the current 
“hottest 
trends.” 

(And 
yes, 
I 
do 

realize I sound like 
a middle-aged white 
mom as I type this 
phrase.) 
Recently, 

I’ve heard friends 
and 
acquaintances 

alike refer to their 
preferences as those of a 
minimalist — be it musical 
taste, 
clothing 
choice 
or 

living arrangement. I’ll admit 
it too — I even found myself 
searching Pinterest the other 
day for “minimalist tattoo 
ideas,” unaware of my own 
reasons for my attraction to 
this particular aesthetic. 

Though 
“minimalism” 

is a term most classically 
associated 
with 
the 

fundamentalist 
artistic 

movement 
of 
the 
mid-

to-late 
20th 
century, 
its 

current application seems to 
encompass everything from 
literature 
to 
architecture, 

from 
zero-waste 
practices 

to 
marketing 
techniques. 

However 
contradictory 

this may sound, evidence of 
minimalism is far-reaching 
and relatively conspicuous at 
this point in our society.

In the midst of all this 

minimizing, 
I’ve 
come 
to 

wonder what composes the 
core appeal of the movement. 
Could 
sustainable 
living 

practices finally be receiving 
the attention they deserve? 
Is 
the 
push 
to 
minimize 

perhaps a manifestation of 
the 
anti-capitalist 
leanings 

held 
(stereotypically) 
by 

many younger folks? Might 
mental health play a part 
in this aversion to excess? 
While the current trend is 
associated most generally with 
an outdoorsy demographic of 
millennials, it really does seem 
to have a diversity of merits.

Blogs, 
magazines 
and 

newsletters 
devoted 
to 

minimalism have sprung up 
left and right over the past 
couple of years, written and 
run by experts on the trend. 
Self-help columnists and life 

coaches alike have adopted 
this philosophy to advise 
their audiences and clients. 
For people like these who 

swear by simplicity, 
one thing is certain: 
Material gains are 
stressful.

With 
the 
rise 

of 
consumerism 

and 
materialism 

well 
underway, 

minimalism might be 
the antagonist we’ve 
all been waiting for. 
This isn’t extremist 
nor counterculture; 

it’s simplistic, accessible and 
conscious. 
It 
promotes 
the 

purchase and possession of 
essentials only, straying from 
materialism without completely 
avoiding the economic role of 
the consumer.

The psychology of picking 

and choosing what to eliminate 
is endlessly fascinating and 
subject to variation between 
individuals. In my own life, 
I find myself most prone to 
excess in — wait for it — food 
transactions. These purchases 
are noncommittal; if I decide 
I don’t need the food, I’ll 
be able to dispose of it with 
only a slight pang of guilt. 
These same qualities don’t 
necessarily apply to other 
consumer items — much more 
guilt accompanies the disposal 
of a never-before-worn shirt or 
a never-before-used blender.

Getting 
in 
touch 
with 

personal consumer tendencies 
is important, and it’s exciting 
that 
the 
trend 
toward 

minimalism 
might 
inspire 

people to do exactly this.

So, why then is the movement 

to minimize so commonly 
associated 
with 
hippie-

wannabes in their early-to-

mid 20s? Instead of focusing 
on individualized definitions of 
the word, people often think of 
the lifestyle trend as attractive 
and pristine in this geometric, 
Instagram-worthy way. In the 
same manner that vegan and 
vegetarian diets are criticized 
for their inaccessibility on a 
broader socioeconomic scale, so 
too is the movement for simple 
living. These criticisms are 
perhaps pointed at a specific 
subcategory of minimalism that 
has developed exclusively in 
wealthy spheres, unfortunate 
portrayals 
of 
a 
generally 

inclusive 
philosophy. 
This 

subcategory is not undeserving 
of the criticism it receives, 
but it vastly oversimplifies 
something 
that 
can 
(and 

should) be highly personal.

Having 
fewer 
belongings 

creates a stronger personal 
attachment to what is already 
owned, 
decreasing 
the 

subjective 
expendability 
of 

these items and increasing the 
likelihood of fixing what is 
broken rather than disposing 
of it. This is good — this is 
sustainable 
and 
monetarily 

efficient. Recently, I’ve heard 
many people openly describe 
their 
consumerist 
style 
as 

“only 
buying 
things 
with 

lifetime warranties,” which 
is exciting. This definition 
of 
careful 
consumerism 

seems to be contingent upon 
an 
item’s 
permanence 
or 

semi-permanence, 
a 
pretty 

honorable philosophy.

Attachment 
to 
material 

items, however few there may 
be, still does constitute a sort 
of materialism. Some claim 
minimizing can become an 
obsession, similar to the toxic 
excitement of consumerism. 
Getting caught up in the 
aesthetics of minimalism can 
be obviously unhealthy, but 
the 
philosophical 
practice 

itself is grounded in individual 
needs and priorities.

There’s 
something 

comforting in minimums, in 
really tapping into lifestyle 
preferences and attempting 
to make those a simplistic 
reality. 
The 
less 
mind 

space is occupied by more 
peripheral and superfluous 
life accessories, the better.

JOSIE 
TOLIN

I

magine you are a social 
justice warrior in college. 
You believe that Bernie 

Sanders’s ideas are novel. You 
are passionate about raising 
the 
minimum 
wage. 
You 

believe women have a right to 
free and safe abortions. You 
think college tuition ought to 
be free for all Americans. 

Now, 
imagine 
that 
you 

are the only student among 
20,000 
who 
holds 
these 

beliefs. Not only that, people 
think you are an inherently 
bad person for stating those 
opinions. They tell you that 
you’re a stupid and entitled 
idealist 
and 
an 
ignorant 

communist. 
They 
casually 

comment how people like you 
are vile because you are from 
an urban area and you voted 
for Hillary Clinton. You are 
a proverbial punching bag in 
class discussions. According 
to the people you see every 
day, you are not just wrong, 
you are evil. You are not just 
of a different opinion, you 
are hateful. You don’t just 
disagree, you are the enemy.

This is me. Except I hold 

conservative beliefs, and the 
rest of my peers are leftists.

I applied to the Ford School of 

Public Policy because I wanted 
to narrow my studies to my 
passions and pursue a career 
in policy analysis. I knew that 
by enrolling in a public policy 
school, let alone the University 
of Michigan, I would have to 
endure heated political debates. 
I welcomed the challenge. I was 
excited to sharpen my debate 
skills and question my own 
opinions by hearing a diverse 
array of perspectives.

After just two and a half 

months in the public policy 
undergraduate program, I am 

fearful. I have been called 
racist for criticizing some 
affirmative action programs. 
My classmates claim that my 
unabashed support of Israel 
stems from a baseless hatred of 
Arabs. They call conservatives 
like me rednecks, brainwashed 
by Fox News and detached 
in desolate “flyover states.” 
I have been called a bigoted 
elitist before even getting the 
chance to open my mouth.

Due 
to 
this 
pervasive 

toxic 
rhetoric, 
I 
now 
sit 

quietly and hold my tongue. 
Say a classmate claims that 
women who are pro-life are 
hypocritical and indoctrinated 
by 
the 
patriarchy, 
and 

multiple people chime in in 
agreement while the professor 
nods her head. I avoid putting 
a big target on my head and 
lie low. I silently listen while 
my opinions are called sexist, 
Islamophobic, 
bigoted 
and 

fascist. Most of my professors 
are not objective facilitators; 
rather, 
they 
encourage 

students 
to 
marry 
their 

ideologies while deeply hating 
all others.

I am not the only one 

taking note of the threatening 
classroom environment.

I overheard a peer accusing 

another student of being a white 
supremacist because he wanted 
to “play devil’s advocate” and 
suggest that water purification 
and distribution should not 
be 
wholly 
funded 
by 
the 

government.

Another classmate pulled me 

aside one day while walking out 
of a lecture on gun control. She 
whispered in my ear, “I am a 
conservative, too.” I asked her 
why she was whispering. With 
fear in her eyes, she said, “I 
don’t want people to hate me.”

The vilification of dissenters 

and 
self-aggrandizing 
is 

antithetical to the mission of 
higher education. A college 
campus should be a place 
to 
challenge 
one 
another 

respectfully and form opinions 
by 
hearing 
a 
diversity 
of 

perspectives. The University 
strives to cater to those who feel 
even mildly offended, but I and 
those like me are easy targets 
for insults.

I am not asking the University 

to silence liberals’ offensive 
statements, and I am not asking 
anyone to cater to me because 
I hold unpopular opinions. I 
am asking for my peers and my 
professors, especially in a public 
policy program, to foster open 
and considerate dialogue. The 
University and students alike 
tout the Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion initiative, but there is 
little to no emphasis on diversity 
of thought. That needs to change.

Instead of shouting down 

speakers, hold a separate event 
to debate their perspectives. 
Instead of throwing out words 
like “bigot” and “xenophobic,” 
listen 
to 
the 
other 
side’s 

reasoning. Develop empathy 
while not assuming the worst 
of 
people 
with 
different 

opinions. 
Open-mindedness 

and 
respect 
are 
critical 

once we graduate from our 
ideologically 
homogenous 

university and find ourselves 
in a diversity of environments.

We all want to see a world 

that 
is 
peaceful, 
inclusive 

and prosperous. We just have 
different ideas on how to get 
there. So, let’s talk to one 
another. Let’s listen carefully. 
Let’s ask questions. Maybe we 
will both learn something.

STARZ

Kerrigan and Seimetz are back again with season 2 of ‘The Girlfriend Experience”
‘Girlfriend’ revels in its 
darker, radical season 2

A show centered on the lives of escorts returns with a twist

TV REVIEW

Last season, we uncovered 

that the world of an escort 
is 
overflowing 
with 
lies, 

secrets, 
scandals, 
and 
the 

obvious, 
sex. 
Thanks 
to 

dynamic character arcs and a 
re-invented structure, season 
two of Starz’s “The Girlfriend 
Experience” is racking up to be 
even darker, bolder and more 
mystifying than the first. This 
time around, the dramatic 
thriller 
diverts 
from 
its 

singular storyline format and 
enables showrunners, Lodge 
Kerrigan (“Keane”) and Amy 
Seimetz (“Upstream Color”), 
to indulge in their individual 
inspirations 
and 
construct 

two 
separate 
narratives 

— 
which 
air 
successively 

yet never intertwine. This 
autonomy, stemming from the 
creators’ desire to rupture the 
boundaries of premium-cable 
TV, not only allows audiences 
to explore the varying realm 
beyond the work of an escort, 
but 
also 
to 
consider 
the 

psychological 
complexity, 

corruption, and divide between 
the socially high and low.

Kerrigan’s 
story, 
titled 

“Erica and Anna,” invades 
midterm election season in 
Washington, D.C. where Erica 
(Anna Friel, “Limitless”), the 
authoritative investment head 
of a Republican political action 
committee, drafts call girl, 
Anna (Louisa Krause, “The 
Abandoned”) to dig up dirt 
and slaughter the reputation 
of her client and dark money 
donor, Mark (Michael Cram, 
“Flashpoint”). This account, 
through its themes of apathy, 
the connection between human 
relationship and currency, and 
blatant coldness, is reminiscent 
of season one of the series, and 
once again offers a glimpse 
into the twisted relationship 
linking sex, money, and power. 

The story is dark and sterile, 
both in concept and staging, 
as almost no light enters the 
hotel room or office where 
the drama ensues. This aura 
strategically mirrors the gritty 
nature of the clandestine plot, 
and successfully promotes the 
show’s overall dismal tone.

Moreover, 
Friel 
and 

Krause’s discerning execution 
of their characters showcases 
an 
interestingly-ironic 

emotionality 
and 
honesty 

inside of two icy, success-
hungry 
personas. 
Is 
Anna 

breaking 
confidentiality 

agreements to simply make 
money? To seek justice? And 
just what she is willing to 

expose and exploit to gain 
what she wants? The skillful 
cast 
of 
actors 
is 
enough 

alone to keep watching “The 
Girlfriend Experience,” and 
the weight of their paltry 
characters’ 
significance 
in 

a much grander U.S. affair 
is extremely relevant in our 
current political landscape.

On the other hand, Seimetz’s 

story, 
titled 
“Bria,” 
seems 

as though it will offer more 
drastic 
and 
introspective 

character development, using a 
humanizing lens to document 
the life of an escort. This 
narrative follows former GFE 
worker, Bria (Carmen Ejogo, 
“The Purge: Anarchy), who, 
along with her reluctant and 
bratty step-daughter, enlists 
in 
the 
Witness 
Protection 

Program 
to 
escape 
the 

impending 
danger 
of 
her 

abusive 
relationship. 
She 

is trained by U.S. Marshal 
Ian 
(Tunde 
Adebimpe, 

“Portlandia”) to believably take 
on a new name, background, 
and job, and is relocated to a 
small town in New Mexico to 
spend some time off the grid. 
However, 
halfway 
through 

her premiere, she is willfully 
tempted back into escorting 
and is on the hunt to make 
extra money from high-profile 
clients.

This story sheds light on 

the persuasive and addictive 
essence 
of 
escorting, 
and 

sharply 
juxtaposes 
Bria’s 

carefree, high-profile life with 
the culture shock that emerges 
after 
she 
is 
thrust 
back 

into a dull and unfulfilling 
environment. The acting is 
impeccable, the concept is 
intriguing and I envision this 
storyline as provoking even 
more hair-raising moments of 
screaming “No, don’t do it!” 
at the screen. Due to Ejogo’s 
nuanced portrayal, after just 
one episode I already find 
myself rooting for Bria, and 
hoping that she will come to 
realize the extent of the peril 
of re-entering the sex business.

Ultimately, 
the 
second 

season 
of 
“The 
Girlfriend 

Experience” 
has 
a 
lot 
of 

potential to comment on the 
deeper social and internal 
struggles of the leading ladies, 
chronicling their raw emotion 
in a stern and poker-faced 
world. 
The 
experimental 

structure leaves room for a 
multitude of twists and turns, 
and the expert acting brings 
characters normally left in 
the shadows to the forefront 
of their narratives. While the 
duo of unrelated stories may 
seem distant from each other, 
an underlying motif of deceit 
ties them together and further 
unearths the unique artistic 
value of this series.

BOOK REVIEW
Obsession & reinvention in 
Trevor’s ‘Book of Wonders’

Characters in the recent collection struggle with a loss of control

“If literature should teach 

us anything, surely it should 
teach us that literature is not 
the only thing that matters in 
life.”

Such a peculiar conclusion 

for a character to come to 
in a short story, but it is the 
one that Theobald Kristellar 
reaches at the end of “Sonnet 
126.” It is the conclusion, as 
a matter of fact, that many 
characters in Douglas Trevor’s 
recent collection “The Book of 
Wonders” eventually reach.

The stories in this collection 

broach many subjects — lost 
love, neglect, embezzlement, 
fraud, the classics — but they 
are all united under one: 
obsession. It is present in 
each story, be it an obsession 
with 
literature, 
a 
person, 

their studies, a library or 
faucets (yes, water faucets). It 
is the paranoid fixation of an 
obsession that seizes us when 
the rest of our life is falling 
to shreds. And that’s where 
the characters of “The Book 
of Wonders” find themselves: 
falling to pieces in one way or 
another and trying to rebuild 
on a cracked foundation.

Colin, Herbert and Theo, the 

protagonists of “The Detroit 
Frankfurt School Discussion 
Group,” 
“The 
Program 
in 

Profound 
Thought” 
and 

“Sonnet 
126” 
respectively, 

display this struggle to rebuild 
in the face of depression. They 
are all professors of literature 
caught in the barren world of 
middle age having experienced 
little 
success 
professionally 

or romantically. Faced with 
their 
own 
stagnancy 
and, 

subsequently, 
their 
own 

mortality, 
these 
characters 

find 
themselves 
floating, 

almost ghostlike, in a world 
devoid of meaning outside their 
copies of “Paradise Lost” and 
Horkheimer’s “Critical Theory.” 
So instead they try to become 
alcoholics, commit fraud to 
feel alive or simply isolate 
themselves from the rest of the 
world and hide in a library, until 
one small shift in what seems 
to be their predestined demise 
causes them to stop, reevaluate 
and rebuild.

Their 
trajectory 
is 

reminiscent of Newton’s First 
Law: An object in motion must 
stay in motion until acted on 
by an outside force. In the 
case of these characters, they 
are on their slow descent into 
meaninglessness until some 
unsuspected force intervenes. 
For Colin it is a stranger from 
Detroit looking to apply the 
Frankfurt School of Thought 
to his perishing community, 
for Herbert it is a new dean 
who finally notices the money 
he has been embezzling from 
Excellence University and for 
Theo, it is a lost Shakespearean 
couplet. 
All 
big 
or 
small 

events in their own right, but 
they provide enough of a jolt, 
enough of a force, to ignite 
change in the three men’s lives. 
Because in the obsessions of 

others, these characters find 
a renewed sense of meaning in 
their own lives.

“Detroit Frankfurt School” 

and “Sonnet 126” draw us near 
to various obsessions, wrap us 
in a character’s intense fixation 
on the Frankfurt School of 
Thought 
and 
Renaissance 

literature and make us feel it, 
while “Profound Thought” lags 
behind in this regard. There 
is some charm missing from 
Herbert’s plight that makes it 
less enrapturing than Colin’s 
and Theo’s; a piece of personal 
familiarity that leaves us less 
invested in Herbert’s demise 
than the others. “Endymion” 
leaves us on this note as well.

Literature is heavily inlaid 

with other protagonists’ and 
supporting characters’ lives 
outside the realm of academic 
work. As we see in “Endymion” 
this extends as far as a Greek 
mythology meeting the streets 

of Boston. Taking the myth of 
Endymion, a beautiful man 
cursed to forever sleep beneath 
Selene, the moon, who was in 
love with him, Trevor reverses 
the roles. Endymion is obsessed 
with 
turning 
our 
narrator 

Cynthia into his moon, and 
lonely and desperate as she 
is, she gives into it, no matter 
how much weight it means she 
may have to gain to achieve 
this. 
Like 
Herbert’s 
story, 

however, her narrative lacks 
balance; there isn’t enough of 
a compromise between plot 
and character, and as a result, 
Cynthia’s internal monologue 
inspires more revulsion than it 
does sympathy.

But 
even 
in 
their 

shortcomings, 
these 
stories 

still succeed. It is simply 
because 
they 
stand 
in 

comparison 
to 
perfectly 

crafted 
stories, 
like 
“The 

Librarian” and “Faucets,” that 
their quality is questioned. To 
speak of the role of obsession 
in this collection is to speak 
of “The Librarian,” “Faucets” 
and “Book of Wonders.” These 
stories drag us deep into the 
psyche of their protagonists, as 
we are exposed to their hopes, 
fears 
and 
uncontrollable 

tendencies. 
One 
centers 

around a child’s need to turn on 
faucets, another a librarian’s 
inability 
to 
stop 
touching 

things — tables, books, plants, 
faces, eyelashes, things — and 
a woman’s possessive control 
over a singular notebook.

Unlike 
“Frankfurt” 

and 
“Sonnet 
126” 
whose 

protagonists find themselves 
saved in another’s obsession, 
these stories take us into 
people who foster them, whose 
identities are intrinsically tied 
to the compulsive behaviors 
that 
envelope 
them. 
And 

because they cannot separate 
themselves from what compels 
them, they find themselves 
clinging to this false sense of 
control, making their stories 
so devastating. There is little, 
if anything, indicating to them 
that this sense of control is 
exactly that: false. There is 
little, if anything, to suggest to 
them that their obsession isn’t 
the only thing that matters in 
life. So it’s that much harder 
for them to reach the same 
conclusion Kristellar does.

SINGLE REVIEW

Just over three years after 
releasing their most recent 

album Keep You, Pianos 
Become The Teeth has 

finally resurfaced with a new 
single from their forthcoming 

record Wait For Love, titled 
“Charisma.” The track kicks 
the band into an uncharac-

teristically quick tempo while 

retaining its penchant for 

tender melodies.

The track immediately greets 

us with a driving bassline, 
noting significant change 
from their pacing on Keep 

You. The rest of the composi-

tion follows suit and keeps 
up with fuzzy rhythm guitar 

and soaring melody guitar 
joining the rapid bass and 

drums. The song is an unde-

niable departure from the 

atmosphere on Keep You, 
but it also holds a familiar 
structure of softly blended 
compositions that undercut 
emotional vocals, character-

istic of PBTT’s most recent 

work.

As a former screamo band, 
PBTT has a come a long way 
from their previously abra-
sive, albeit still gorgeously 
composed style. On “Cha-
risma,” lead vocalist Kyle 

Durfey has traded in the pen-
sive, withdrawn tone that was 

used on much of Keep You for 
an outward, observant sound, 
mirrored in the track’s lyri-
cism. It’s warm and inviting, 
far from the suffocating long-

ing on the band’s previous 

material.

“Charisma” begs the obvious 

question of where exactly 

the band is headed with this 
new record. The track sees 
PBTT at their poppiest yet, 
using their unique melodies 
to welcome and uplift in an 
unprecedented form for the 
band. Never stagnant, PBTT 
has consistently evolved their 
sound with each release, and 
if “Charisma” is any indica-
tion, Wait For Love won’t be 

an exception.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Kimbra’s music is constantly 

evolving — she found her 

roots in jazz, grew into pop 
and is moving into a new era 
of electronic funk. Nonethe-
less, her work is consistent 

and electric, no matter 

what it is influenced by. It’s 
been three years since her 
last release, her critically 

acclaimed sophomore effort 

The Golden Echo, which 
veered into more experi-
mental territory for the 

New Zealand artist, and her 
videos from that album mir-
rored this change. Now, as 
the first singles are released 
for her upcoming 2018 album 
Primal Heart, this shift into 
the future is notable. Kimbra 

is growing with her music, 
and the music video for sec-

ond single “On Top of the 
World” shows this clearly.

In the video, Kimbra’s con-
torted dance moves shudder 
to the harsh beat of the song, 

as she sings in a matrix of 
four stone pillars, teetering 

in a dark, desolate land-

scape. Though the minimal-

ist setting seems too simple 

at first, “On Top of the 

World”’s entrancing sound 
follows the artist through 

black, edgy costume changes 

and increasingly complex 

lyrics and tempo. She seems 
witch-like, but almost more 
powerful than that, as the 

chant-like verses continue 
into thumping chorus after 

chorus.

In a way, the video almost 
exactly mimics the emotion 
and primal beat of the song, 
evoking the dark empower-
ment detailed in its words. 
Repeating again and again, 
“I’m on top of the world / 

See me top of the herd,” the 
artist pushes forward into 
the space around her. As the 
columns around her start to 
shake and fall while the song 

advances, it becomes clear 
that Kimbra means busi-

ness — she is truly on top of 
the world, ready to make her 

mark in a world that once 

held her down.

BOOK REVIEW
‘The King is Always Above’ 
is a sensitive & subtle work 

On April 28, 1945, Benito 

Mussolini was executed. His 
lifeless body was dragged to a 
public square in Milan, where 
it was defiled by the crowd 
gathered 
there 
and 
hoisted 

upside down with a meat hook 
on a half-built gas station. An 
infamous photograph of the 
hanging 
depicts 
hundreds 

with their gazes fixed upon the 
expressionless corpse swaying 
between the clouds.

In the title story of Daniel 

Alarcón’s 
latest 
short 
story 

collection “The King Is Always 
Above the People,” postcards 
portraying 
an 
unnamed 

dictator in a pose similar to the 
deceased Mussolini are sold as 
souvenirs. Those postcards bear 
inscriptions of the same name 
as the collection: a seven-word 
phrase that encapsulates the 
main concern behind the set of 
ten stories.

The world Alarcón has crafted 

reflects the current state of the 
Americas, both North and South. 
Social 
unrest, 
immigration 

and opportunity all frame the 
political backdrop that is present 
in every story, yet never explicitly 
detailed. The characters that 
populate this world are uncared 
for by society, ready to explore 
what lies ahead but unable to 
leave their past behind. Alarcón 
blends all these elements to craft 
powerful stories that animate 
the voices of the voiceless.

Often, the opening story is 

most vital to the lifeblood of a 
collection, and “The Thousands” 
is no exception. In only three 
pages, it relates the hardships 
of an unnamed people as they 
attempt to make new lives for 
themselves on fallow land in 
jury-rigged homes made from 
plastic 
tarps, 
rubber 
tires, 

quilts and other odds and ends. 
Despite government attempts 
to intervene and enumerate 
this 
people, 
they 
remain 

united under the titular label 
the cartographers gave them, 
a name they liked “because 
numbers are all [they] ever 
had.” And though the characters 
present 
in 
the 
subsequent 

stories are not explicitly one 
of “The Thousands,” they are 
cut from the same cloth. Much 

like the many oppressed and 
underprivileged 
persons 
in 

countries south of the border, 
they are people who are easily 
described by their numbers, with 
their names and stories going 
unnoticed. However, through 
rich prose and a conventional 
yet unfamiliar approach to the 
short story form, “The King Is 
Always Above the People” shines 
a crucial light on the thousands, 
if not millions, of people whose 
true lives are kept hidden from 
the rest of the world.

The characters Alarcón has 

drawn up for the collection 
are imperfect human beings, 
stuck between the past and the 
future. They kill, they indulge 
themselves, they take advantage 

of others but they have the 
capacity to love, to change, to 
better themselves. What makes 
them complex is their endeavors 
to act on that capacity, which 
often results in failure but 
opens the door for important 
growth and understanding. All 
of the stories’ main characters 
are 
explicitly 
male; 
their 

masculinities are harmful to 
them and becomes a burden they 
must confront. In the tightly 
crafted “República and Grau,” 
this conflict is observed through 
three different lenses: youth, 
adulthood and old age. Maico is 
a ten-year-old boy who is forced 
by his easily-angered father to 
“apprentice” under an elderly, 
blind street beggar in order 
to help keep his family afloat 
financially. In working with the 
beggar, Maico realizes that the 
old man’s blindness is more than 
physical and is able to clearly 
see that his father’s machismo 
and anger stems from misguided 
yet well-intentioned efforts to 
protect him. Through a brilliant 
ending, Maico achieves clarity 
about the future unknown to 

any of his elders. Though this 
clarity is unattainable for most 
adult characters in the whole 
collection, it is what drives 
them. The collapse of the titular 
structure 
in 
“The 
Bridge” 

and how it disrupts life as the 
story knows it represents the 
unsustainable present, which 
should link past and future but 
is slowly collapsing under the 
weight of thousands

All of the stories in “The King 

Is Always Above the People” 
revolve around how choices 
in the present determine a 
future 
still 
unknown, 
but 

they all approach it distinctly 
through varied narratives and 
writing 
styles. 
“The 
Ballad 

of Rocky Rontal” is an aptly-
named narrative about a Los 
Angeles 
gangbanger’s 
quest 

for redemption after a life of 
violence, entirely written in the 
second person. Halfway through 
“The Provincials,” a story about 
a boy and his father’s uneasy 
return to their hometown, the 
story trades in paragraphs for 
a screenplay that illustrates 
the boy masquerading in an 
unattainable 
role 
he’d 
been 

preparing his entire life, a 
young man who successfully left 
behind his home country for a 
better life in the United States. 
And in “Abraham Lincoln Has 
Been Shot,” the totemic figure 
of American values is now a 
statesman 
from 
modern-day 

Chicago with a male lover and 
aspirations to be a poet before 
all of this is quickly taken away 
from him with a single bullet.

Through each of these stories, 

Alarcón 
builds 
an 
innocent 

setting that invites the reader to 
lovingly study it and contemplate 
its deeper meaning long after the 
book is closed. The characters he 
presents reveal an oft-neglected, 
yet urgent viewpoint which is 
necessary for all to experience. 
Through subtle politics which 
slyly makes themselves known 
through Alarcón’s writing, he 
has created a backdrop all too 
familiar to the happenings of 
the world today. While Daniel 
Alarcón has a ways to go before 
he is a true equal to Flannery 
O’Connor and Gabriel García 
Márquez, like the back-cover 
blurbs say he is, “The King Is 
Always Above the People” has 
proved him to be a remarkable 
modern voice for Latin America.

DAILY ENTERTAINMENT & CULTURE COLUMN

Batman v. Superman v. 
Marvel v. My Patience

There’s a scene in “Batman 

v Superman: Dawn of Justice” 
in which Wonder Woman sits 
at a computer and proceeds to 
click through folders of other 
superheroes waiting to appear 
in other movies. When watching 
this, one feels as though they have 
suddenly been dropped into a 
Warner Bros. production meeting, 
and you can almost see the dates 
and dollar signs of these future 
films dancing in front of you. This is 
what it has come to. Two hundred 
million dollar movies starring 
BATMAN and SUPERMAN have 
become nothing more than trailers 
for future movies. The budding DC 
film universe has had three misses 
and one critical hit in this past 
summer’s “Wonder Woman” and 
now we are at last faced with what 
this has all supposedly been for: 
“The Justice League.” 

I wanted to like “Batman v. 

Superman.” Some things in it were 
really good. Ben Affleck kills it as 
Batman. Wonder Woman was cool 
for the 5 seconds she was in. But 
that movie was, for the most part, 
a complete mess, an idea in search 
of a reason for its existence. Now 
we’re faced with that reason in 
“Justice League,” and if the result 
is lackluster, does “Justice League” 
just become the stepping-stone to 
“Justice Universe” or some other 
future product that will make all 
this nonsense worthwhile? It’s 
hard to say. Marvel fans would 
likely point to the ever-expansive 
Marvel movie-verse as evidence 
that this can work “if you just do it 
right,” but the real question is if it’s 
time to stop doing it at all. 

I would rather see another 

“Batman 
v. 
Superman” 
than 

another “Ant-Man” or “Thor.” 
Frankly, these DC movies try and 
they fail. Sometimes they fail in 
extremely epic fashion, but they do 
try. So we’ve reached a crossroads of 

garbage. We now have a choice. DC 
movies that try and fail or Marvel 
movies that barely try at all. Does it 
even matter what we choose? Both 
are going to make ungodly sums 
of money anyways. Superheroes 
are dominating the multiplexes. 
Super villains are plotting more 
and more intricate schemes to try 
to defeat our increasingly contract 
bound 
heroes. 
The 
greatest 

scheme of all though is that of the 
movie studios that have somehow 
tricked mainstream audiences into 
accepting the same exact thing on 
repeat, with sequels and spinoffs 
and sequels to the spinoffs and 
spinoffs to the sequels, forever. 
DC and Marvel aficionados fill 
the film internet subculture with 

their endless bickering over which 
franchise is superior. When both 
franchises 
feature 
paper-thin 

storytelling and no end in sight, 
what does it matter?

And that’s just the thing. Marvel 

studios have spent so much time 
building 
themselves 
up 
their 

“Cinematic Universe” that they’ve 
really lost sight of what this is all 
about. Will both “Justice League” 
and whatever the next Avengers 
movie is make tons of money? 
Yes. Does that mean that they 
are successful motion pictures? 
No. It’s true that filmmaking is 
a business but it’s also an art. 
Disney and Marvel fundamentally 
changed the way film series are 
structured with their buildup to 
“The Avengers,” yet I can’t help but 

feel that with each new film in their 
universe all they accomplish is that 
they dilute the entire enterprise. 
The true strength of a movie is 
shown not when it is released, but 
how it fares given time. Great films, 
true classics, are passed down from 
generation to generation. When a 
film resonates with someone born 
30 years after it was released, that is 
the mark of classic. The generation 
before us had Star Wars, we had 
Harry Potter. Those are the types 
of stories that are told and retold, 
shared and discovered by new 
children year after year. They are 
stories that resonated enough with 
people that they show them to their 
kids. I do not claim to be a seer; the 
future may indeed prove me wrong, 
but I find it hard to believe that 
20 or 30 years from now we will 
be sitting down with our children 
and saying, “Here’s a real classic, 
kids: It’s ‘Avengers: Age of Ultron.’ 
Sure you have to see the previous 
seven movies exactly like it (‘Iron 
Man,’ ‘The Incredible Hulk,’ ‘Iron 
Man 2,’ ‘Thor,’ ‘Captain America: 
The First Avenger,’ ‘The Avengers,’ 
‘Iron Man 3,’ ‘Thor: The Dark 
World,’ ‘Captain America: The 
Winter Soldier,’ and ‘Guardians of 
the Galaxy’ for those counting) to 
understand what’s going on, but 
I’m sure you’ll like it. Oh, and it’s got 
great special effects!”` The number 
of superhero films being released 
these days is just astounding. With 
the oversaturation of these films 
we can only hope and pray that 
sooner rather then later audiences 
will just say “enough” to superhero 
movies altogether. The alternative 
is a world in which men and women 
in capes destroy cities and save 
the planet from destruction every 
other week, and moviegoers keep 
paying eight dollars each time to 
see them do it. In a world where 
every hero is super, no one is.

Wolverines likely without Hill at Wisconsin

Sophomore 
cornerback 

Lavert Hill was immediately 
placed 
into 
concussion 

protocol last weekend, exiting 
the Michigan-Maryland game 
at halftime. 

Hill, 
who 
has 
two 

interceptions and eight passes 
defended 
this 
season, 
is 

unlikely to take the field when 
the 24th-ranked Wolverines 
(5-2 Big Ten, 8-2 overall) face 
off with No. 5 Wisconsin (7-0, 
10-0) this Saturday.

As of Wednesday, Michigan 

secondary 
coach 
Mike 

Zordich said that Hill wasn’t 
participating in any practices.

“That’s a wait-and-see kind 

of thing,” Zordich said. “I know 
he’s in the protocol right now. 
… That means that he has to 
see a doctor every day, certain 
symptoms have to go away, and 
if they stay, then other certain 
things happen.”

As 
Michigan’s 
top 

cornerback 
this 
year, 
Hill 

usually matches up against the 
opponent’s top wide receiver, 
but Zordich isn’t too concerned 
about Hill’s absence.

He expressed full confidence 

in the team’s other starting 
cornerbacks 
— 
sophomore 

David 
Long 
and 
redshirt 

junior Brandon Watson. He 
stated that Long and Watson 
have 
both 
been 
improving 

each day in practice, and even 
without Hill, Michigan will be 
“absolutely fine.”

“(Long), 
daily, 
has 
been 

getting better,” Zordich said. 
“(Watson) doing the same… 
What’s great about it is they’re 
taking the coaching. It means 
something to them, and you 
can tell by their performance 
and their technique.”

Behind Long and Watson, 

the younger cornerbacks have 
impressed Zordich as well.

True 
freshmen 
Ambry 

Thomas, Benjamin St. Juste 
and 
Jaylen 
Kelly-Powell 

have all entered games for 
a few reps, despite mostly 
contributing to special teams. 
Thomas is the most likely to 
get more minutes with Hill out, 
but St. Juste and Kelly-Powell 
both made appearances in the 
defensive backfield against the 
Terrapins.

Kelly-Powell 
mainly 

practices at nickelback, where 
he serves as a fifth defensive 
back in addition to the typical 
two corners and two safeties.

As Zordich explained, Kelly-

Powell has been asked to play 
nickelback, 
cornerback 
and 

safety at different times this 
season, and was a bright spot 
at each of those. In the future, 
though, Zordich foresees Kelly-
Powell developing mostly as a 
nickelback where he can cover 
slot receivers — something he 
showed that he could do well 
against Maryland.

“He’s like a little magnet,” 

Zordich said.

Kelly-Powell arrived in Ann 

Arbor as a four-star recruit 

from 
Cass 
Technical 
High 

School in Detroit. One of many 
highly-touted prospects from 
Cass Tech, he was ranked as 
the No. 1 safety in the state of 
Michigan and 21st-best in the 
country.

Nonetheless, it is unlikely 

that 
Kelly-Powell 
handles 

significant 
defensive 
back 

minutes in Hill’s absence.

Those duties will fall almost 

entirely 
on 
Watson, 
Long, 

and 
Thomas, 
while 
junior 

Tyree Kinnel and sophomore 
Josh Metellus will be the 
Wolverines’ starting safeties 
against Wisconsin.

The Badgers are a run-heavy 

team, which has been the 
defense’s focus this week, but 
quarterback Alex Hornibrook 
still presents a threat with a 64 
percent completion rate and a 
155.6 quarterback rating.

“We can’t afford to fall asleep 

on the back end,” Zordich said. 
“(Hornibrook has) got a hell of 
an arm.”

Three Wisconsin receivers 

— Quintez Cephus, Jazz Peavy 
and George Rushing — are all 
out this week with injuries. 
Cephus is Hornibrook’s top 
receiver with 501 yards and six 
touchdowns this season.

Still, Michigan must account 

for tight end Troy Fumagalli. 
The 6-foot-6 senior has three 
receiving 
touchdowns 
this 

year, and Michigan’s secondary 
will have to keep their eyes on 
him coming off the line.

“We have good tight ends on 

our team, so it’s nothing that 
we haven’t seen,” Metellus 
said. “We cover for a living.”

It 
doesn’t 
matter 
that 

Wisconsin runs the ball on 77 
percent of its plays and three of 
its receivers aren’t able to suit 
up this weekend.

Hill’s absence makes the 

other 23 percent of plays that 
much more important.

“They’ll just pound it, pound 

it, pound it,” Zordich said. 
“Then all of a sudden,” CLAP, 
“play action or rolling out. 
We’ve gotta be ready for that.”

Sophomore cornerback Lavert Hill will likely miss Saturday’s game, as he is still going through concussion protocol. 

Flaherty to face tough test in Asia Durr

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team won its first two 
games of the season, just as it was 
supposed to do. It let George Mason 
hang around, but eventually put 
away the Patriots by 14. Two days 
later, the Wolverines dismantled 
Liberty, 74-50.

In No. 5 Louisville, its opponents 

in Thursday’s Preseason WNIT 
semifinals, Michigan gets its first 
real test.

The Cardinals made the Sweet 

16 last season before falling to 
Baylor and don’t seem to have lost 
much. They’ve come out of the gate 
strong with a 3-0 start, including an 
overtime victory against No. 9 Ohio 
State in Columbus. Their other two 
opponents more closely resemble 
the 
Wolverines’ 
– 
Southeast 

Missouri State and Toledo were 
both stomped by Louisville.

Michigan 
may 
find 
itself 

especially stretched on defense. 
Senior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
has stepped into point guard on 
offense seamlessly, but she’s still 

adjusting on defense and the 
Cardinals won’t make it easy.

Asia Durr, their lead ball-

handler, is a scorer perhaps on par 
with Flaherty herself. The junior 
guard is averaging 23 points per 
game on 48.9 percent shooting 
from the field. That includes a 
47-point performance that pushed 
Louisville past Ohio State.

Offensively, Flaherty may have 

to carry a larger load than normal. 
That should be no trouble – she’s 
just nine points away from passing 
Diane Dietz as the program’s 
all-time leading scorer after all. 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
has also stressed that Flaherty gets 
more touches in practices.

“I think our team started to 

realize that they have to find 
her,” she told WTKA on Tuesday 
morning. “And that’s something, for 
some of our young kids especially, 
they’re coming from high school 
where they had the ball in their 
hands 95 percent of the time. Now 
you have a player like Katelynn 
Flaherty on your team where, ‘Oh 
my goodness, where is she? I have 
to find her, I have to locate her to 

try to get her touches.’”

If the Wolverines decide to 

slide Flaherty over to another 
player on defense, redshirt junior 
Arica Carter is a likely candidate. 
She’s less of a scorer than Durr, 
averaging just six points per game. 
That would likely mean sliding 
junior guard Nicole Munger onto 
Durr, which may be more palatable 
for Barnes Arico.

Freshman 
forward 
Hailey 

Brown will have a big role to 
play as well. The Cardinals start 
three guards — Jazmine Jones 
being the third — creating a 
potential matchup problem for 
Michigan, which starts Brown 
in its frontcourt alongside senior 
forward Jillian Dunston and junior 
center Hallie Thome. Though 
Louisville will have a speed 
advantage, Brown matches up well 
with Jones in terms of height and 
could snatch some rebounds away 
from the sophomore as well.

Brown’s play on the boards will 

become all the more vital if Thome 
gets into foul trouble. That was the 
case against Liberty, when Thome 
committed four fouls, and the 

Canadian freshman stepped up to 
the plate.

“If we lost Hallie Thome last 

year at any point, we were in a 
panic and we were like, ‘Oh my 
goodness, how are we gonna get 
through the next few minutes with 
Hallie on the bench?’” Barnes Arico 
told WTKA. “And now, Hallie was 
in foul trouble the whole game the 
other night and we were okay. It 
was the first time that we were ever 
okay with her not in the game.”

Against a team like Louisville, 

Thome getting into foul trouble 
would be a much bigger problem. 
The Cardinals have dominated the 
boards thus far this season. Over 
their first three games, Louisville 
has outrebounded opponents by 
14, 18, and 30, respectively. The 
Wolverines are no slacks on the 
glass, but if Thome gets into foul 
trouble, things could get dicey.

The Cardinals are likely to be the 

toughest opponent Michigan faces 
until Ohio State – perhaps even all 
year. The Wolverines are unlikely 
to pick up a victory on the road, but 
this game will test their mettle and 
show us if this is really a contender.

Sweep helps ‘M’ bounce 
 

back after rough stretch

The serve was long — a 

fitting way for the Michigan 
volleyball team to clinch a 3-0 
victory over No. 8 Michigan 
State, the best serving team in 
the Big Ten. 

After losing two of their last 

three matches, the Wolverines 
had a chance to bounce back 
at home in front of a sold-out 
crowd against their in-state 
rivals. 
After 
handling 
the 

Spartans easily in the first set 
on its way to a 25-20 victory, 
Michigan 
won 
the 
second 

and third sets — but by much 
slimmer margins.

The Wolverines maintained 

a steady lead throughout the 
first set. Michigan State did 
not pose much of a threat; 
Michigan took the lead and did 
not relinquish it. The teams 
were tied just once after the 
game began — and that was 
with the score tied at two.

Sophomore outside hitter 

Sydney Wetterstrom led the 
way in the first set with six 
kills, including two huge spikes 
that cut off Spartan scoring 
runs.

After the match, Michigan 

coach Mark Rosen praised 
Wetterstrom for her play. She 
finished with 15 kills and a 
team-high .423 hit percentage. 
 
 

“She’s a producer,” Rosen 

said. 
“She’s 
someone 
that 

makes everybody else better 
around her. … She’s fearless. 
I think that fearlessness, you 
know in athletics if you’re 
fearless, you’re dangerous, and 
that’s exactly how she is.”

The second set was a more 

hard-fought battle than the 
first. 
There 
were 
multiple 

break points, in addition to 
a whopping 23 lead changes, 
before 
the 
Wolverines 

ultimately came out victorious.

According to Rosen, this 

set was the make or break 
moment of the match. A 2-0 
lead allowed Michigan to relax 
slightly, as opposed to what its 
mentality would have been had 
Michigan State won the set and 
tied up the match. 

“To us on the bench (in the 

third set) we felt like, ‘Hey, 
we got them where we want 
them’ because they were kind 
of panicking,” Rosen said. “I 
think had the second set gone 
their way, all of the sudden 
it’s 1-1, it’s a whole different 
mindset.”

One 
of 
the 
defining 

moments of the second set was 
when senior opposite hitter 
Katherine 
Mahlke 
made 
a 

huge dig, putting her body on 
the line by crashing into the 
scorers table as she saved the 
ball. The Wolverines would 
eventually 
win 
the 
point, 

garnering huge applause from 
the packed crowd.

That play exemplified the 

type of grittiness junior libero 
Jenna Lerg thought Michigan 
needed in order to win the 
match.

“We just had nothing to 

lose,” Lerg said. “We don’t have 
a ranking to lose, they have a 
ranking to lose. We’re trying 
to fight these last three, four 
matches we have because we 
want to play in (the) postseason 
and they have stuff to lose. 
… We were kind of balls out 
today.”

The third and final set was 

very similar to the second, as 
it came down to the very last 
point.

Ironically, in a game in 

which the Wolverines made so 
many aggressive and fearless 
plays, with players sliding and 
diving all over the court, the 
game ended without a single 
Michigan player even touching 
the ball.

Gritty showing proves 
fruitful for Wolverines

Centimeters separated senior 

opposite hitter Katherine Malkhe 
and the scorer’s table as she 
sprawled over it to save a loose ball. 
With a backward flick of the wrist, 
she pushed the ball back into play 
and watched as her teammates 
finished off the point to salvage a 
seemingly dead play. 

Michigan State called a timeout 

promptly 
after 
to 
calm 
the 

atmosphere, but it proved useless 
as Michigan continued on with 
its sweep of the eighth-ranked 
Spartans in three sets.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

dominated the set count, every 
point mattered in each of the 
closely-contested frames.

Players such as junior outside 

hitter Carly Skjodt, junior libero 
Jenna Lerg and freshman middle 
blocker Kiara Shannon recognized 
this and made plays on the ball 
every time the opportunity was 
given.

In the midst of a second set that 

involved 23 lead changes, Lerg dove 
forward at the ball inches above 
the ground. In a last-ditch effort, 
she threw her arm underneath to 
propel the ball to sophomore setter 
MacKenzi Welsh, who then set up 
Adeja Lambert as the senior outside 
hitter cut to the net.

The ball, killed by Lambert, 

curled off two Spartan blockers and 
out of bounds, and Michigan was 
rewarded for its effort with a 21-20 
lead.

“I think it’s more so of a mindset 

than a physical skill,” Lerg said. 
“Even if the ball is two centimeters 
off the ground, just making effort 
for it because you never know when 
you can get it and when you can’t.

“We have this saying in the gym, 

that’s ‘Let the ball decide. Don’t 
decide if you can get the ball. Let the 
ball decide.’”

Skjodt followed suit, recording 

12 digs and numerous hustle plays 
that would have lost the Wolverines 
the point if they were not made. One 
notable play was a one-handed dig, 
similar to Lerg’s, that produced 

a Michigan State error and a 
Michigan lead in the third set.

Meanwhile, 
Shannon 

contributed to the Wolverines’ 
effort with her refusal to allow roll 
shots past her. As a Spartan player 
tried to float a soft ball above her, she 
would tip it to Welsh off of a block 
attempt, rather than put the burden 
on a pursuing Lerg to receive it.

With the Wolverines’ grit and 

aggression, the pressure was on 
the Spartans to make similar 
plays. Despite leading the nation in 
service aces, Michigan State failed 
to replicate that effort, and instead 
gave up nine service errors and 15 
attacking errors.

Defensive 
gambles 
allowed 

Michigan to benefit from those 
errors. Each player took it upon 
themselves to be accountable for 
every point scored against them. 
This allowed the Wolverines to play 
without hesitation — making the 
aggressive block or assist instead 
waiting for the dig, or jumping to 
the sideline for a stray ball without 
fear of injury.

“Your mindset controls how you 

react,” said Michigan coach Mark 
Rosen. “If you’re nervous, or you’re 
afraid, or you’re not confident, then 
you look slow, or you look like you’re 
caught off guard. Defensively, I 
thought we scrapped really well, 
especially earlier in the match. And 
we just created so many scoring 
opportunities in transition because 
of our defense.”

The 
importance 
of 
these 

extra efforts was emphasized by 
the score’s closeness. With the 
Wolverines scrapping for every 
point, everything mattered in 
a game where the second and 
third sets ended 29-27 and 25-23, 
respectively.

“The worst misnomer in sports 

is, ‘Oh, this team wants it more than 
the other team,’” Rosen said. “Every 
team wants it. It’s mentally being 
in the right place, where you’re 
confident, and relaxed and able to 
react. And tonight, our players were 
in that zone where they let each 
other play and not think. Because 
as soon as you think, the game’s too 
fast.”

Senior guard Katelynn Flaherty has transitioned well to point guard on the offensive end, but will now be tasked with stopping Lousiville’s biggest scoring threat.

Conversation with Pearson brings Marody’s play to new heights

For Cooper Marody, the road 

to recent success started with a 
serious talk. 

Three weeks ago, Michigan 

hockey 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson 

called the junior forward into 
his office for a conversation 
about his practice habits.

Heading into an important 

series in State College against 
then-No. 
15 
Penn 
State, 

Pearson 
needed 
to 
ensure 

one of his team’s biggest stars 
was practicing to the fullest, 
working his hardest and playing 
his best come game time. He 
underscored 
taking 
practice 

as seriously as any game only 
builds better habits for when 
the lights shine brightest.

Until that point, Marody 

hadn’t fulfilled Pearson’s hopes 
in practice, and it showed. In the 
first four games, he registered a 
lone assist in the Wolverines’ 
regular season opener against 
St. Lawrence and displayed little 
other offensive production.

The two discussed his status 

on a team that now ranks fourth 
in the country with 3.9 goals 
per game. They spoke about his 
oft-lackadaisical approach to 
practice and what is expected 
out of a leader day in and day 
out.

“You can tell when someone 

is working hard and paying 
attention to detail and he 
wasn’t,” Pearson said. “We knew 
he was going to have a prominent 
role, so we just wanted to make 
sure. Sometimes as a player, you 
maybe don’t understand it or 
you think you’re working hard, 
but sometimes you don’t know.

“He just needed a reminder 

and we had to let him know 
he’s an important part of our 
team, but he had to be one of 
the hardest working players. 
I’m not saying he was just 
going through the motions, I 
just thought he thought he was 
working. He needed reminders 
— the subtle, kind reminders.”

The meeting paid off.
Marody has notched three 

goals and 12 assists in his last 
six games. Over that span, the 

Brighton, 
Mich. 
native 
has 

recorded multi-point outputs 
in each contest, highlighted by 
three-point 
performances 
in 

both matchups against Penn 
State and a game-winner and 
two assists in a 7-2 rout over 
Ferris State on Nov. 3.

And as Marody thrived, so 

did Michigan.

The Wolverines split series 

against 
the 
highly-touted 

Nittany Lions and Bulldogs and 
collected a win and tie — both 
in exciting comeback fashion — 
against then-No. 4 powerhouse 
Minnesota. In short, Marody 
has been instrumental in slowly 
transforming a team originally 
picked to finish sixth in the 
Big Ten preseason coaches poll 
into an early dark horse NCAA 
Tournament 
contender 
now 

ranked 17th in the nation.

“I 
can’t 
say 
it’s 
that 

conversation, but from that 
point on, he’s been really, 
really good,” Pearson said after 
Friday’s 5-4 overtime victory 
against the Golden Gophers. 

“He’s 
fun 
to 
watch, 
he’s 

dangerous and he’s working so 
much harder than he was the 
first few weeks.”

Both Pearson and Marody 

had eerily similar answers about 
where the latest outburst came 
from. A workmanlike attitude, 
attention to detail, confidence 
and chemistry on the first line 
with senior forwards Dexter 
Dancs and Tony Calderone all 
point to Marody’s recent surge. 
However, it all starts with a 
positive mentality in practice.

“There’s a direct correlation 

between his work ethic and 
his production,” Pearson said. 
“I think part of it is mentally, 
you’ve got to punch it in 
mentally and prepare. … He 
started to pick it up when we 
went into Penn State, which we 
needed him (to do) in a tough 
rink. It’s not a coincidence his 
hard work paid off. Sometimes 
it doesn’t, but I’m glad it did 
in this instance because it 
reaffirms 
working 
hard 
in 

practice.”

A 
big 
Tom 
Brady 
fan, 

Marody 
constantly 
watches 

his videos, which emphasize 
the importance of practice. 
Nevertheless, even after taking 
cues from the former Michigan 
football star, Marody believes 
Pearson’s gentle nudging came 
at the right time.

“(Brady) stresses that when 

he was here, he had to prove 
himself every day and practice 
every day like they were trying 
to replace you,” Marody said. “I 
knew the importance of practice 
from that, but it was just a great 
reminder by Coach to talk about 
that and just try to approach 
every practice like it’s a game 
and it needs to be like that.”

Pearson 
showed 
Marody 

videos of himself, illustrating 
when low energy in practice 
translated to miscues in games. 
Marody 
wasn’t 
in 
proper 

position, didn’t capitalize on 
opportunities to move the puck 
and was often beat up and down 
the ice.

The coach also noted the 

tough position Marody’s level 
of effort put him in. How could 
Pearson continue to reward one 
of his best players with extra ice 
time, especially on the power 
play, when he wasn’t a top 
worker?

But over the past three 

weeks, Marody has changed his 
mentality and become more of 
a role model during practice. 
It has paid dividends for both 
himself and his teammates.

Dancs 
credits 
some 
of 

Michigan’s 
recent 
success 

to 
Marody’s 
newfound 

determination.

“Coop’s 
a 
super 
talented 

player,” Dancs said. “He has 
elite offensive skills and I think 
with a guy like that when he has 
confidence, he’s really scary to 
play against. I think that over 
the last six games, he’s gained 
that confidence and now that 
he has that confidence, you 
get more and more and keep 
going and going and it’s like a 
locomotive going forward. … 
He’s on the top of his game.”

It was a tough climb to the 

top.

Marody 
is 
focused 
on 

playing his first full season 
as a Wolverine. In January 
of his impressive freshman 
campaign, he was sidelined 
with mononucleosis for the 
remainder 
of 
the 
season. 

The next fall, he was ruled 
academically ineligible to play — 
partly due to the previous year’s 
illness — and laced up for just 
18 games as a sophomore. Now 
healthy, Marody is on track for 
career-highs in all categories.

His 16 points this season 

are seventh-best in the NCAA 
and his 13 assists rank second. 
Tied for first in the Big Ten 
with 10 points — one goal and 
nine helpers — Marody was 
named the conference’s Third 
Star of the Week following his 
two-goal, two-assist weekend 
against Ferris State.

But to Marody, none of the 

accolades matter when it comes 
to the upcoming tasks at hand, 
such as facing top Big Ten 
opponents like No. 9 Wisconsin 
this weekend and making a run 
at the NCAA Tournament.

“I think it’s an honor to 

be given those things, but I 
don’t put much self-worth into 
that at all,” Marody said. “It’s 
nice to receive awards and 
acknowledgment, but that can’t 
be your focus. You can’t be 
doing things to receive awards, 
you do things to help your team 
and help yourself be the best 
player you can be.

“I think the road is just 

starting for our team. We’re just 
10 games in and it’s going to be 
a long season and we have to 
be better moving forward. The 
past is the past and we’ll focus 
on the future.”

For Marody, that future looks 

bright.

A 
serious 
talk, 
which 

redirected 
Marody’s 
course, 

led to a player with a newfound 
confidence and a necessary 
spark in his game. It didn’t take 
long for Marody to return to his 
elite playmaking abilities from 
his freshman year.

All it took was a conversation 

with his coach.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Now starting, McKeon needs celebration work

When it comes to celebrating, 

Sean 
McKeon 
is 
no 
Odell 

Beckham Jr. 

The 
sophomore 
tight 

end scored his first career 
touchdown in the first quarter 
of Michigan’s 33-10 win over 
Minnesota on Nov. 4.

McKeon, 
of 
course, 
was 

pretty excited — perhaps too 
much so.

After sprinting in untouched, 

he ran straight to the corner 
of the endzone and promptly 
shushed his own home crowd.

McKeon realized towards the 

end what he had done. But it was 
already too late, so he went on 
with it before returning to the 
bench and celebrating further 
with teammates.

“I was pretty emotionally 

fired-up,” McKeon said, smiling, 
Tuesday night. “Just had a lot of 
adrenaline going through. Not 
really sure why I did that, but I 
guess it was kinda funny.

“It might be my thing now, but 

we’ll see. They all made fun of 
me a little bit for it. It’s alright.”

Sophomore left guard Ben 

Bredeson 
counts 
McKeon 

as one of his best friends on 
the team. He was happy that 
McKeon finally scored — and 
also admitted he was “one of the 
major guys” who 
gave 
McKeon 

“some crap” for 
his celebration.

“I 
saw 
it 

the 
next 
day, 

actually, 
and 

sent it to him 
immediately,” 
Bredeson 
said 

Tuesday 
night. 

“Just wanted to 
make sure that 
he knew that I knew.”

So it was clear McKeon hadn’t 

practiced his celebrations. But 
he had worked on everything 
that went into scoring the 
touchdown.

McKeon’s two biggest goals 

this offseason were to bulk 

up to 250 pounds and earn 
the starting tight end job. He 
currently 
weighs 
245 
after 

losing some weight during fall 
camp. He did hit 250 at one 
point, though, and he’s also the 
starter now, leading Michigan in 
receptions and receiving yards 
in two of the past three games.

His 
25 

catches, 
256 

receiving 
yards and two 
touchdowns 
— first, second 
and 
first, 

respectively, on 
the team — are 
simply the fruits 
of his offseason 
labor.

McKeon 

spent a lot of time in the weight 
room over the summer. He also 
spent a lot of time with redshirt 
freshman quarterback Brandon 
Peters, often texting his friend 
to join him at Schembechler 
Hall.

“From day one, we’ve been 

working out together, throwing 
and catching balls together,” 
McKeon said. “We used to come 
in on weekends, early mornings, 
and throw. I think we’ve got 
a good connection because of 
that.”

All of that work built on the 

foundation McKeon laid his 
freshman year — a foundation 
that began with the help of 
former tight end Jake Butt.

McKeon, 
who 
enrolled 

early in the winter of 2016, 
recalled leaning on Butt in 
those early days. The freshman 
from Massachusetts was the 
neophyte. 
The 
veteran 
All-

American was the mentor.

McKeon watched film of Butt 

running routes. He followed his 
lead in blocking exercises. The 
pair completed drills that used 
tennis balls instead of footballs.

One 
of 
those 
involved 

McKeon using one hand to snag 
balls bounced against a wall. 
Another involved him turning 
around quickly to catch balls 
thrown by Butt. Naturally, it 
took some time to adjust.

“I wasn’t too great at it at 

first, but after a little bit, I got 
a little better,” McKeon said. 
“That helped out a lot and just 
catching footballs, too. Footballs 
and tennis balls. It’s all about 
hand coordination and reaction 
time.”

McKeon still talks to Butt 

occasionally. Just two weeks 
ago, Butt — a fifth-round draft 
pick of the Denver Broncos 
this past spring — FaceTimed 
his young protégé. The two 
caught up on life and, obviously, 
football.

The latest piece of advice he 

gave McKeon was to strengthen 
his neck and shoulders while 
staying flexible.

Of course, there was nothing 

about touchdown celebrations. 
That’s for McKeon to learn on 
his own.

Tyree Griffin presents 
 

next test for Michigan

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team wasn’t supposed to get its 
first major test until it went to 
Hawaii. 

Last Saturday, though, North 

Florida stayed 
close with the 
Wolverines 
for most of the 
game. Monday, 
Central 
Michigan 
pushed 
them 

even 
further. 

Now, Michigan 
(2-0) isn’t in any 
position to take 
teams 
lightly. 

Thursday, 
Southern 
Mississippi 
(1-0) 
will 

be 
the 
next 

challenger.

The 

Golden Eagles 
struggled 
last 

season, finishing with a dismal 
9-22 record and placing near the 
bottom of the Conference USA 
standings. This wasn’t abnormal 
for Southern Mississippi, which 
has won a combined 20 games in 
its three seasons under coach Doc 
Sadler.

Even still, the Golden Eagles 

provide 
some 
things 
that 

Michigan hasn’t seen to this 
point.

For one, they predominantly 

play man-to-man defense. The 
Ospreys and Chippewas both 
employed variations of a zone, and 
the Wolverines had mixed results. 
Thursday will be the first glimpse 
of how Michigan will fare against 
a more traditional defense.

Additionally, 
Southern 

Mississippi may possess the most 
talented player the Wolverines 
have faced thus far in guard 
Tyree Griffin. Griffin started 

15 games for Oklahoma State in 
2015-16 before transferring at the 
end of the season. After sitting out 
last year, Griffin is now the focal 
point of Sadler’s offense – he led 
the team with 21 points in their 
season opener.

Michigan coach John Beilein is 

friends with Sadler, so he’s familiar 
with his style of play. In fact, at 
his press conference Wednesday, 
Beilein was complimentary of his 
counterpart.

“(His teams have) always been 

… very much of a containing man-
to-man, 
fundamentally-sound 

teams, play from the inside out,” 
Beilein said. “He’s done a great 
job at just getting players to play 
fundamentally sound and just 
win with strong, strong, man-to-
man defense.”

For its own part, Michigan 

will be looking to do something it 
hasn’t done yet this season: blow 
out a lesser opponent.

The Wolverines’ game against 

North Florida did end up looking 
more lopsided than it was, as 
they got hot from three-point 
range and simply overpowered 
the Ospreys. Against Central 
Michigan, 
though, 
Michigan 

never truly found its groove 
offensively, and it only won by 
seven points.

Perhaps the Wolverines’ first 

look at a man-to-man defense 
will allow their superior talent 
to shine through, as they’ll face 
more one-on-one opportunities. 
There’s also a case to be made 
for Michigan simply not having 
gelled together yet. With so many 
new faces, that will simply take 
time. 

After Southern Mississippi, 

though, 
the 
Wolverines 
are 

essentially out of time. Maui is 
five days away, and with it, the 
first Power 5 conference teams 
Michigan will face. If things 
aren’t figured for Beilein’s team 
by then, there’s a far better chance 
their perfect record will be soiled.
