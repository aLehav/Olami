School of Information
becomes the first to
be involved in two
new initiatives
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily Staff Reporter
After a ceeoyWednesday
afternoon, the University's School
of Information expanded its part-
nership with the Peace Corps
through two new initiatives.
The first agreement allowed the
University to create its own branch
of the Paul D. Coverdell Fellows
Program. The Coverdell program
provides financial support and aca-
demic credit to any students who
have previously served in the Peace
Corps, allowingthemto countpart
of their time in the organization
towards graduation.
The second created a partner-
ship with the University and the
Master's International Program,
which will allow students to start
their Masters in Science in Infor-
mation before serving in the Peace

Corps and return to it once they
complete their service. This pro-
gramis the first ever at an Informa-
tion School.
According to Judy Lawson,
assistant dean for student and aca-
demic affairs, students' time in the
Peace Corps will fulfill six intern-
ship credits, a total of360hours.
After returning to the program,
students will be required to par-
ticipate in the Initiative for Infor-
mation Impact-a set of service
based projects including Alterna-
tive Spring Break, Citizen Interac-
tion Design, Global Information
Engagement Program and Michi-
gan Makers, Lawson said.
"I think the interest around the
School of Information is one that
has really grown out of the existing
relationship but also a realization,
both on the part of the Peace Corp
and people here at Michigan who
have worked with the Peace Corps,
that there is a real need within the
work of the Peace Corp around
information technology," James
Holloway, vice provost for global
and engaged education, said.

Director of Peace
Corps examines
organization's
future
By JOEL GOLDSTEIN
For the Daily
Fifty-four years ago, U.S.
Senator John F. Kennedy, then
presidential candidate, held an

impromptu election speech on
the steps of the Michigan Union,
where he proposed to more than
5,000 students the idea of the
Peace Corps, a volunteer orga-
nization to help impoverished
nations.
One year after Kennedy's
speech, the Peace Corps was
established through an execu-
tive order. Since the estab-
lishment of the program, the
University has supplied the
fourth most volunteers to the

C orps~
organization, with 2,556 gradu-
ates serving in the Peace Corps.
Carrie Hessler-Radelet, act-
ing director of the Peace Corps,
spoke at the Ford School of
Public Policy Wednesday, dis-
cussing the future of the orga-
nization. The talk was part of a
series of policy talks held at the
Ford School this year.
Recently, Hessler-Radelet
has focused on improving effi-
ciency and safety within the
organization. The Peace Corps

goals
experienced scandal prior to
Hessler-Radelet's tenure due to
allegations ofcovering up sexual
assaults of volunteers while they
were abroad. Hessler-Radelet
implemented the standards of
the 2011 Kate Puzey Peace Corps
Volunteer Protection Act, which
are meant to train and protect
volunteers.
Hessler-Radelet has served as
acting director since July 2013.

Summer session to
be extended to year-
long curriculum
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily Staff Reporter
For 24 years, the Teach for
America program has catered
to college graduates hoping to
help underprivileged students
through a two-year teaching
stint in schools across the coun-
try.
While many TFA applicants
hear of rewarding experienced
garnered through the program,
they are less likely to be informed
of the problems corps members
experience once in the class-
room.
Many alumni have criticized
the TFA program for undertrain-
ing corps members and throwing
inexperienced teachers into dif-
ficult classroom situations.
The summer prior to their
first year in a classroom, pro-
spective teachers must com-
plete a five-week teaching
crash course. University alum
Rohan Dharan, a current Las
Vegas-based corps member,

said the crash course was simi-
lar to "cramming" an education
degree in five weeks.
"I definitely learned a ton at
institute, but teaching is such
a multi-faceted thing," Dharan
said. "Until you're in a position
running your own classroom,
figuring out what works for your
kids, I can't say I walked in 100
percent prepared."
The Washington Post, The
Atlantic, NPR and other news
organizations have published
first-hand accounts from TFA
alum who had experiences simi-
lar to Dharan's involving appar-
ent lack of preparation.
In an effort to confront this
criticism, TFA co-CEOs Elisa
Villanueva Beard and Matthew
Kramer announced recent-
ly that next year early TFA-
admitted college seniors will
participate in a year-long pilot
program.
The program will focus on
teacher education and will pro-
vide participants with an extra
year to practice their teaching
skills before they are in charge
of their own classroom.

Diana Chen, a 2011 graduate
of the University who majored in
Political Science and Philosophy is
a third-year law student at Loyola
University Chicago Law School.
She is also the founder ofLawStud.
io, an online crowdsourcing plat-
form for startups and small busi-
nesses to find affordable legal help.
How did you conceptualize
the idea of LawStud.io?
I'm in my third year of law
school right now and I had the
opportunity to work in two dif-
ferent law firms. I saw the inef-
ficiencies of the law firms and
thought, "How can we fix these
inefficiencies?" A lot of it is a lack
of technology that makes things

go slower, but, also, I think the
market is shifting from large cor-
porations to startups and small
businesses.
What did you do to gain
insight intoyour company?
I got involved in the startup
community in Chicago and saw
the perspective from the busi-
ness owners, which was that they
couldn't afford legal help. A lot
of people don't understand how
important it is to have a lawyer
and take steps to prevent them-
selves from getting into legal
trouble. This is a way to help
people realize how important it is
and also give them an easier way
to get it done.

What experiences at Michigan
did you bring to your
startup experience?
During my time at Michi-
gan, I had the opportunity to get
involved ... I started working at
Telefund my freshman year and
got promoted to student man-
ager position, which was a really
good experience for me to be able
to take on full responsibility and
learn how to lead and manage
a team. Also, Michigan is a big
school, and you have to be aggres-
sive in getting involved. No one
really hands you anything on a
plate. Those were all useful skills
that helped me do what I'm doing
now. L

including Google Glass, Xbox

cookie decorations.
Attendees could also find a
station on the new Bachelor of
Science in Information, which
provided information about the
program and the opportunity to
schedule an appointment with an
advisor.
The BSI program, an upper-
level program for juniors and
seniors, focuses on how people
connect with technology and
how people share information
with organizations. The program
also focuses on making a bridge
between the client and the tech-
nical sides of an organization.
Undergraduate program
adviser Katy Ross said the School
of Information had been dis-
cussing creating the program
for many years. Ross said she
kept hearing from students who
wanted to take courses outside of
their school and engage with the
School of Information.
"We felt like it was time to
go ahead and launch our own
degree," Ross said.
The BSI program will be
offered beginning in Fall 2014.
To apply, students must have at
least sophomore standing and
must have completed a series of
prerequisite courses
Ross said the School of Infor-
mation already accepted the first
round of students into the BSI
program, including Information
sophomore Madison Garver, and
Heindel who will be transferring
to the School of Information next
year.
Heindel said he was pleased
with the turnout of the event and
hopes to oigani, the event again
in the future.

For many corps members,
the TFA teaching course is

they attended sessions dis-

"You really don't get a

An ethical investment
The 'U'must monitor the moral consequences of its financial commitments
ed by the Students Allied for Freedom and Equality, the
movement for the University of Michigan to investigate its
financial investments has received significant and well-deserved
attention on campus. In the last few weeks, SAFE has raised legitimate
concerns about the University's ethical standards for investment, calling
attention to alleged human rights violations by companies the University
has invested in. The activism led by SAFE and its allies is admirable, as
the group has brought to light disturbing questions about the University's
behavior. The University cannot allow the allure of profits to muddle the
school's ethical standard. As with all of its actions, the school must hold
itself to a fundamental morality when making financial investments.

No close friend left behind

Think about all the friends
you've made since getting
to college. Have a number?
Great. Now,
here's a harsh
reality: for every
12 friends you've
made, you'll ,
only statistically
remain friends .
with one of them. 2
For many MICHAEL
Michigan stu- SCHRAMM
dents, college is
the best oppor-
tunity to make friends. Newfound
independence, plus 40,000 people our
age, equals social interaction. We'll
never again live in a microcosm so
designed for creating relationships. So
we take advantage of our surround-
ings.We make friends in our residence
halls, classes, student clubs and Greek
communities. Some of these people
become our close friends, even our
best friends, but after we vacate our
dorms, finish classes and leave our
organizations, we too often leave our
friends along with these spaces. This
shouldn't happen. Of course, we can't
maintain every friendship, but we're
not maintaining many that we should.
Now, not everyone's terrible at
maintaining connections. It's entire-
ly possible that you easily stay in con-
tact, but statistics say we're generally
not. A recent study showed that we
have 396 friendships over the course
of our lives, yet we only maintain 33
at a time. Out of 33, only six are con-
sidered close friends. Here's another
statistic: seven out of 10 people iden-
tifylosing11outof12 friends as one of
their biggest regrets, so losing touch
isn't a habit we welcome or accept -
it's a legitimate problem.
Which makes sense.At our core,we
have an innate desire for companion-
ship.Wetryavoidingalonelystate,but
our constant busyness makes schedul-
ing friend time difficult. After enough
time, we lose touch with many once
close companions, and both parties
feeluncomfortable initiating a conver-
sation. Post-college life worsens the
situation. Moving, work and children
causeincreasedbusyness,meaningwe
have fewer opportunities to make new
friends. Couple this with our inability
to stay in touch, and we push needed
socialization on fewer people. This
toxic trend continues as we settle into
long-term relationships. Our roman-
tic partners increasingly engulf our
needs until our friendship circles nar-
row significantly - eventotally.
And though romantic partners
provide an otherwise unattainably
powerful friendship, they alone can-
not satisfy the human craving for

interaction. One reason is we exam-
ine our friends' personality traits and
incorporate the ones we most enjoy
into ourselves. As we become famil-
iar with each individual, we come to
understand their ingredients - what
makes them them. After spending
enough time together, we pinpoint
the traits we admire. Eventually, con-
scious or not, we merge these traits
into our identities. Maybe witnessing
your friend's level-headedness gives
you composure in stressful situa-
tions. Perhaps hearing a rationally
grounded yet emotional boyfriend
rant causes you to feel and express
your emotions. Regardless of which
traits you appreciate, no single per-
son demonstrates every admirable
characteristic. We need many people
with differing traits to be the best
person that we can be.
Friendships are more than a tool
forself-improvement. They're funda-
mental in gettingthe most out of life.
Outside of necessary alone time, life
is simply better enjoyed with people.
Favorite pastimes can be fun alone,
but oftentimes being with a friend
enriches these activities. I'm sure we
can all look to our last lunch, movie,
workout or night out and remem-
ber the highlights and memories
came from moments driven by social
interaction. Friends also invite us to
activities we would otherwise never
do. You may never realize that you
love grabbing coffee or taking walks
until a friend makes the suggestion,
but they may quickly become favorite
pastimes. You don't even need active
conversation to enjoy friend time;
even comfortable moments of silence
can feel enjoyable with a friend.
Whichever activity is chosen, hav-
ing an assortment of friends maximiz-
es these experiences' values. Going
to lunch with different people can be
drastically different, but you enjoy
each one. Partofthis enjoymentcomes
from having a wide variety of interac-
tions and personalities, and no matter
which friend you choose, activities
feel considerably more fun with life-
longfriendswho knowyou intimately.
But friendships aren't just use-
ful during good times; they aid us
in times of struggle, and we need a
variety of people to guide us through
problems. Different friends possess
different strengths. Some friends are
perfect for relationship advice while
others provethe perfectconfidant for
family issues. Different friends even
fill specific subcategories among dif-
ferent topics. Sometimes you just
need an emotional vent while other
times you need advice. At times you
need someone to validate your opin-
ion while occasionally you need your

friend to empathize and express the
frustration you're experiencing.
I'm sure it didn't take this column
for you to realize that friendships
are important. I think every student
agrees that great friends enhance
life, but if we understand this, why
don't we maintain them? They pro-
vide us with substantial benefits, yet
the effort we invest in them doesn't
equal their significance. This imbal-
ance likely stems from how rapidly
we befriend in college. After leaving a
residence hall, class or organization,
we quickly enter another where we
make other great friends - assum-
ing life will always occur like this
and enduring friendships will effort-
lessly last. However, similar to the
flawed logic of love's effortlessness,
friendships require attentive nurtur-
ing. And as we move, marry and have
children, maintaining friendships
- let alone making new ones - will
become increasingly difficult. As col-
lege students, we'll never have a bet-
ter opportunity to make friends.
So while you have the opportunity,
consciously develop friendships with
people you enjoy. Send the text mes-
sage about planning a lunch catch-up.
Or get coffee. Or play video games. Or
go work out. Or Skype them if you're
far away. It may feel uncomfortable
if you haven't spoken in months, but
receiving the "Yes! I've missed you,"
text trumps the potential awkward-
ness and occasional non-response. I
promise. If you consistently do this,
you and your friend will develop the
ability to remain close even without
speaking for awhile. That's important,
because life is busy and you can't get
lunch with 60 people every week, but
you can keep in touch with 60 people
you value.
But don't feel like you need 60
friends. Everyone's different, so
everyone requires a different num-
ber. If you only have 20 friends,
that's fine as long as you haven't lost
someone important for lack of keep-
ing in touch. Whether or not you
remember, if you really cared about
someone, you had a reason, and see-
ing them again will likely remind you
of their significance. These people
deserve a place in your life. Though
quality is better than quantity, qual-
ity and quantity are better than just
quality because progressing through
life is better when done with many
people you've known for a long time.
Sharing your life and creating memo-
ries are always better with people
you care about, or more importantly,
who care about you.

Last Tuesday, the Central Student
Government voted to indefinitely postpone a
vote on Assembly Resolution 3-050 proposed
by SAFE. The resolution called for CSG to
petition the Board of Regents to create an
ad hoc committee to investigate University
investments in companies accused of
violating human rights, including General
Electric, Heidelberg Cement, Caterpillar Inc.
and United Technologies. The CSG Student
Assembly voted to indefinitely postpone a
decision on the resolution.
CSG's refusal to vote on the resolution
was a failure in the institution of student
representation. A student government has
a responsibility to listen to consider the
demands of the student body. The student
government is not bound by any requirement
to only represent a majorityvoice on campus.
In fact, as the representative body, CSG is
obligated to highlight the perspective of
minority and underrepresented groups. A
blind endorsement of the majority prerogative
is to create a dangerously homogenous voice.
The University of Michigan is a diverse
institution that values all points of view, and
the student government should act as such.
By refusing to even allow a robust debate
on the proposed resolution, the CSG Student
Assembly effectively ignored the very
constituency they were elected to represent.
Furthermore, by enacting an indefinite
postponement and thus denying future
dialogue, CSG not only failed to listen to
students, but effectively silenced SAFE and
the 37 student organizations in support, a
significant student voice on campus. With
CSG presidential election polls closing
tonight, the next administration needs to
take steps to ensure that this injustice does
not happen again.
The University's investment strategies
must adhere to a code of ethics. Currently the
school has an existing President's Advisory
Committee on Labor Standards and Human
Rights in which the University vests power
to protect human rights and labor standards
in all agreements involving University
licensing. It protects several areas of human
rights, including labor rights, women's rights
and health and safety standards. While
their commitment to social justice wherever
the University logo appears is admirable,
similarly high standards should be applied to
University investments. .
As a public institution, created by a
government that supposedly charges itself
with the pursuance of human rights, the
Universityhas aresponsibility to continuously
monitor all investments that may be
contradictory to its values. By investing in
companies that are engaging in human
rights violations, the University is complicit
in those actions. Failure to monitor ethical
issues surrounding its investments indicates
detrimental moral values and a solely profit-
motivated mindset on the University's part.
As a state-funded institution, the University
must be ethically proactive in all of its actions.
Failure to adhere to these ethical guidelines
is a direct contradiction of the University's
commitment to social justice issues.
In order for the University to create
an ad hoc committee, three conditions
must be met. According to the CFO's
statement on University investment, there
must be a general campus consensus, the
organization, industry or entity in question
has demonstrated behavior antithetical to
the core mission and values of the University
and these bodies can be proven to be
responsible for their implications. However,
these requirements are unnecessary. These

red tape barriers allow the University to
keep investing in companies that don't fit our
ethical and moral standards. The University
should always have a committee reviewing
whether or not organizations, industries or
entities we invest in comply with ethical and
moral standards - not just when they have
already significantly violated human rights.
In doing this, the University would not be
breaking new ground. Stanford University's
Statement on Investment Responsibility
states its trustees are responsible for taking
into account ethical factors when setting
investment policies and voting practices to
address allegations of "substantial social
injury" while investing, or considering an
investment in corporations. The University
should have a strict code of ethics in place as
demonstrated by Stanford, and ensure that
it carefully evaluates how its endowment is
being spent. Investment decisions not only
represent what virtues the administration
supports, but also reflect the interests of the
students and alumni. Donations and tuition
make up a significant amount of endowment .
and not letting the students or alumni have a
say in, or for that matter even suggest to look
into social implications of the University's
investments, is in itself an act of undermining
their rights.
Columbia and Harvard University
each also have an Advisory Committee
on Shareholder Responsibility comprised
of four faculty members, four current
students and four alumni. These committees
formulate recommendations on what
social, environmental and political policies
that shareholders should support. This
information is then relayed to other
committees who determine proxies on
social issues. The committees occasionally
investigate investment and divestment
policies as well.
In 2009, several students advocated
for the creation of a similar group at the
University without success. It is vital that
the University establishes a system similar to
the ones enacted by Harvard and Columbia.
The committee must directly acknowledge
the interests of the student body and alumni
while making investments, especially
considering its vast student body and the
diverse communities it encompasses.
Just as this University has grown from a
backwater college in the forested Midwest
to one of the world's leading academies of
thought and action, so too has our inviolable
moral duty. We commend any student group
that calls on this institution to live up to
the high ethical standard that it sets for its
students, and indeed itself, in so many other
areas. Ifnothingelse, SAFE and its allies have
re-centered the campus conversation on the
balance between the University's fiduciary
and moral imperatives. Any company
complicit or duplicitous in human rights
violations is unworthy of our investment and
the many exemplary individuals who have
helped buildthe endowment over the course of
generations. To that end, the University needs
to institutionalize a permanent mechanism
to evaluate complaints against companies
that are suspected of doing business with
unethical regimes. A committee composed
of faculty, students, administrators, alumni
and community members can dutifully and
thoroughly evaluate these claims and publicly
recommend to the Board of Regents whether
or not these companies merit divestment or
other sanctions. Until such a committee is
established, willful blindness will continue to
be a poor substitute for defining leadership on
one of the pressing issues of our time.

Stand with FORUM

Now, more than ever, students
are frustrated with Central Student
Government. Some feel their voices
are not being heard, others are con-
cerned that the current administra-
tion only has a specific demographic
of students in mind and a vast per-
centage of students have no idea
what CSG has been working on this
past year. This administration's ini-
tiatives included a costly bus route at
the expense of student organization
funding and a changed ticket policy
this year. But there is much more to
CSG. Or at least there should be.
CSG needs immediate redirection
to becomea relevant body and fulfill
its purpose of serving the students.
Our Central Student Government
has great potential to be a unifying
organization for the varying per-
spectives on campus, a resource for
students and groups lookingto influ-
ence improvements at Michigan and
a place where all students feel their
voice is not only germane, but cher-
ished.
It's that potential that led us to
FORUM. A former chair for an oppo-
sition party, seniors with no tangible
stake in the outcome and students
from all different perspectives and
demographics - these are the cam-
pus leaders that make up FORUM.
Over and over again you've heard

us say we're out to empower stu-
dents, creating a more open dialogue
at Michigan - and we mean it. It
started with the open and transpar-
ent way we recruited our candidates
so that everyone who wanted to join
had a fair shot. But it doesn't end
there - even if we win this election.
An open dialogue mustbe constantly
evolving. It shows that we're always
thinking, always tweaking our ideas
based on your input.
The past few weeks we've been
on the Diag and at Pierpont Com-
mons asking students "What do you
want a FORUM for?" in your stu-
dent government. The response has
been impressive and overwhelm-
ing. Students want more trans-
parency within CSG, with many
students noting the fact that pieces
of legislation passed by this year's
assembly are not even accessible on
the CSG website, a clear example of
the current administration's failure
to reach the students. They want
increased security and safety at the
University, more sustainability ini-
tiatives and a more open and inclu-
sive campus climate among many
other ambitious platforms and
causes championed.
We've delivered on some of those
things already. We've lobbied Uni-
versity Health Services for online

appointment-making. It's now a real-
ity. We're working with the Univer-
sity Administration to reform the
Race and Ethnicity requirement to
become more relevant and construc-
tive. We've had FORUM rep collabo-
ration in everything from initiatives
for increased minority enrollment,
institutional expansion of voter reg-
istration and broadened access to
contraceptives on campus in residen-
tial halls and at UHS.
We believe in Carly Manes, Pavi-
tra Abraham and the representa-
tive candidates we have selected as
a group that can come together to
finally have the constructive, mean-
ingful campus dialogue that has been
missing from the current govern-
ment. This group is united because
the status quo is not sufficient for this
student body.
We are not a monolith; our party
is a collection of diverse perspec-
tives. But what we have in com-
mon, what binds us, is our passion
for improving the daily lives of
all students, not a select few. And
that's why we stand with FORUM.
Join us on March 26 and 27 at
vote.umich.edu.
Sam Dickstein is is the FORUM's
Party Chair and Greg Terynn is
FORUM's Communications Director.

Holloway and Jeffrey
MacKie-Mason, dean of the
School of Information, signed
the agreements with Carrie
Hessler-Radelet, acting direc-
tor ofthe Peace Corps.
"The School of Information
is committed to giving students
opportunities to help people
use information, with technol-
ogy, to build a better world,"
MacKie-Mason wrote in a
pressrelease. "ThePeace Corps
offers students an unparalleled
chance to put that knowledge
into practice, creating innova-
tive solutions to help others."'
University alum Gabriel
Krieshok, who served with
the Peace Corps in Madagas-

car, said in a press release his
experience allowed him to see
the impact technology has on a
community.
"The University of Michi-
gan's School of Information
afforded me the tools and
hands-on experience to make
an impact on international
development issues," Krie-
shok said.
The University frequently,
ranks as a top contributor
of Peace Corps participants.
Last year, the University
placed fifth nationally and
third among Big Ten schools,
trailing the University of
Wisconsin and Ohio State
University. In 2013, 81 gradu-
ates went on to work for the
Peace Corps.
The University has histori-
cally maintained strong ties to
the Peace Corps since its cre-
ation, which President John
F. Kennedy announced on the
steps of the Michigan Union in
1960.

dents who discussed living with dis-
abilities as part of the SSD Student
Advisory Board event speakABLE
at Hatcher Graduate Library where
each student spoke individually
about their experiences.
Kapur discussed his frustration
with being rejected after 22 consec-
utive job interviews. As a Ross stu-
dent, one of the top business schools
in the country, Kapur said he real-
ized that discrimination was playing
a factor.
During a meeting with a repre-
sentative from General Motors, the
representative told Kapur that he
had not interviewed someone in a
wheelchair inthe past15years.
"The University of Michigan
emphasizes diversity," Kapur said.
"But I feel the University could excel
more at teaching us howto dealwith
a world that isn't as open to diversity
as we would hope."

Rackham student Alison Stroud,
who is deaf, said that she felt com-
fortable coming to the University as
a student with a disability, butthinks
there are improvements that could
be implemented.
Stroud said that as a freshman,
she had some of the most difficulty
when attending mass meetings and
speaker events. She said she wants
the University to consider making
screens with transcripts, such as the
one at the SSD event, present at most
events.
Stroud added that she would like
the University to expand its course
offerings featuring disabilities, espe-
cially since the University does not
have a disabilities studies curricu-
lum.
LSA junior Ryan Bartholomew,
chair of Central Student Govern-
ment's Commission on Campus
Accessibility and Disability Affairs,
discussed his experience as a trans-
fer student living in North Quad
with a roommate with a disability.
He said they quickly became close
friends.

Bartholomew said he realized the
"deplorable" evacuation protocols
for students with mobility impair-
ment during an unplanned fire drill
in North Quad last year. He said DPS
did not have a realistic plan for evac-
uatingstudents with disabilities, and
the North Quad resident advisors
neglected the issue. Bartholomew
and his roommate met with Uni-
versity representatives, who were
"shocked" at the state of the current
protocols to reform the policies.
LSA junior Callan Luch spoke of
her experience of being afflicted by
undiagnosed schizoaffective dis-
order while at the University. The
University was supportive and, since
her return, she has seen a psychia-
trist through the University Health
System and a psychologist through
CAPS.
Luch added that the University's
Office of Financial Aid awarded her
a scholarship to cover her hospital
bill of more than $11,000 after her
initial stay.
Luch said that she wants to be an
advocate for defying negative stereo-

types about people with disabilities
and mental illness.
"I am not what happened to me,"
Luch said. "I am what I choose to
be."
LSA sophomore Drew Clayborn
broke his neck while performing a
back flip four years ago. He said that
with the diversity present on cam-
pus, students can always find oth-
ers they are similar to, but it is more
difficult to find students willing to
reach outside their comfort zones to
people who are different from them.
Bartholomew discussed the
theme of "otherness" and how soci-
ety views people with disabilities
fearfully as others. Bartholomew
said this is a dangerous narrative.
Social Work student Lloyd Shel-
ton said many view disability as a
limiting term that assumes people
with these characteristics are weak-
er and less than others.
"This is not what I saw of every-
one who spoke today," Shelton said.
"When I look around the room I
don't see weakness ... I see greatness
and I see victors. I see champions."

about how to design it, how to test
it," said Engineering junior Ben
Wang, the team's electrical lead.
"We learned from mistakes."
Five teams - mechanical, con-
trols, electric, aerodynamics and
business - came together to build
the car from scratch, excluding
a few motors and batteries. The
front wheels are powered by elec-
tric motors, and the back wheels by
a combustion engine.
Engineering senior Connor St.
John, team co-captain, said it's
the first year that the car looks
like they "put thought into it." He
said the last two years were well-
thought out too, but that this car
is better designed - a jump that he
credits to the experience gained in
the last two years.
"We really stepped up our
game. We took a lot more design
considerations," said Engineering

junior Forrest Coghill, the team's
co-mechanical lead. "I would say
the whole vehicle is a little more
streamlined."
Coghill,whowilllead nextyear's
team with Wang, said the future of
the Formula Hybri; competition is
uncertain as industry sustainabil-
ity preferences and standards are
in flux.
"Companies like Testa are push-
ing electric vehicles and I think
that's ultimately where the indus-
try is going to go," he said. "So I
could also see the competition
going in that direction."
That means the team may have
to prepare to adapt to possible
shifts in the competition. Coghill
said he imagines this change could
take the form of a modular base
frame that can support both hybrid
and fully electric systems.
Engineering senior Karan Patal,
team co-captain, added that the
car was complete two-and-a-half
weeks earlier than it was last year,
which the captains credit to amoti-
vated team.

GOALS
From Page 1A
Corps, Hessler-Radelet worked
with Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity to develop Indonesia's first
comprehensive AIDs manage-
ment program. Since taking
the reins at the organization,
Hessler-Radelet has created
advocacy and-support groups
for volunteers who were vic-
tims of violence while abroad.
"The thing that keeps me up
at night is volunteer safety,"
Hessler-Radelet said.
Earlier Wednesday, the
Peace Corps announced a new
partnership program with the
University's School of Infor-
mation. The Peace Corps aims
to tackle problems in public
health, climate change and
entrepreneurship, all while
creating a rewarding experi-
ence for volunteers.
Hessler-Radelet spoke about

improving the diversity of vol-
unteers serving in the Peace
Corps. To achieve diversity,
the organization shortened the
application process from eight
hours to one hour as well as
provided scholarships for vol-
unteers who want to return
to college. Additionally, each
regional recruiting office plans
to hire one diversity recruiter.
The organization is also
working to streamline the
application process, with the
goal of sending applicants
abroad within six to nine
months of their application.
Hessler-Radelet hopes to dou-
ble the number of applicants
with the new process.
Fifty years after the launch
of the Peace Corps on the steps
of the Union, Hessler-Rade-
let believes the organization
is still relevant. She said at
least 12 presidents of African
nations credit the Peace Corps
for providing services that
allowed them to achieve their

current success.
Even though the organi-
zation has been successful,
Hessler-Radelet said there
are issues she still wants to
address, namely continuing to
ensure volunteer safety.
However, she added that
research has found that a Peace
Corps volunteer is at no greater
risk serving abroad than some-
one living in the United States.
Another issue that worries
Hessler-Radelet is funding.
The organization, which draws
funding from the federal gov-
ernment and private dona-
tions, currently receives $1
from every tax-paying Ameri-
can. Despite being constrained
by funding, the Peace Corps
has spread to 139 countries and
trained close to a quarter-mil-
lion volunteers.
Even with the problems
facing the Peace Corps, there
was a strong turnout from for-
mer Peace Corps volunteers at
Wednesday's meeting.

"It looks like there's prog-
ress for the Peace Corps,
whereas before it felt like the
Peace Corps was staying as it
was," Rackham student Ger-
aldine Montesinos, a returned
Peace Corps volunteer, said.
Hessler-Radelet announced
other new ventures including
collaborations between uni-
versities in the United States
and those in host countries,
as well as non-governmental
organizations. She is also
using data to focus on allocat-
ing resources to make the most
meaningful and cost effective
changes to the organization.
At one point in her speech,
Hessler-Radelet asked the
returned volunteers to stand
up. This was her way of dem-
onstrating the tangible impact
the program makes.
"Sometimes it's a mayor,
a minister, a mom," she said.
"All who feel like their life was
transformed by a Peace Corps
volunteer."

mEVENT SPOTLIGHT: Detroit Partnership Day
By Alicia Adamczyk, Weekend Roundup Editor
vi-

University students volunteering at DP Day in 2013.

DP Day, now in its
15th year of op-
eration at the Uni-
versity, has become an in-
tegral part of the campus
service community.
Sponsored by the De-
troit Partnership, a stu-
dent-run nonprofit at the
University that coordi-
nates student volunteer
programs with communi-
ties in the city, the event is
the largest day of service-
learning at the University.
While it can be viewed
by students as a day to
travel sans cost to De-
troit and participate in
club-mandated commu-
nity service, this year DP's
organizers are trying to
engage students to think
critically about their ex-
periences and engage
with the Detroit commu-
nity in a substantive way.
Students will work at
19 different sites across
the city in an effort to con-

nect to and serve Detroit.
LSA senior Samantha
Edwards, the executive
director of the Detroit
Partnership, said her main
goal for the year was to in-
corporate more students
who live in Detroit into
the program. Edwards
herself is from the city.
"What makes me feel
like I can leave on a posi-
tive note is that our Detroi-
ter representation, vol-
unteers, has increased,"
Edwards said, noting that
Detroiters currently com-
prise 6.5 percent of DP,
as compared to 4 percent
last year.
"Even as a Detroiter on
the planning team there
were times when I felt
isolated, I felt like 'is this
organization really for
me' ... I realized that it is
a struggle and it will take
time for Detroiters to ac-
tually trust DP, but we're
making strides toward

that."
Additionally, the direc-
tors strove to change some
perceptions around the
day of service this year.
Public Policy junior
Patrick Sier, DP's major
events director, oversees
the planning and logistics
for DP Day. In more than
12 months of planning, the
DP directors reevaluated
every site and program
detail this year in order to
provide students and the
Detroit community with
the best possible service-
learning experience.
"DP Day became a
thing your student org
just sort of does," Sier
said. "It wasn't a thought-
ful event, it was done be-
cause it was done in the
past. I think we made
it more intentional and
more targeted."
To encourage students
to think critically about
their time in the city, this

year the rally held at the
end of the day will be
transitioned to a reflec-
tion that will hopefully
promote further engage-
ment among students.
"It's less about 'Con-
gratulations great job,
you did such a great thing
today,' and more about
let's think about this, why
are you here, what did
you gain, what did the
community gain and how
can we continue this in
the future," Sier said.
The reflection will
include speeches from
Lloyd Carr, former Mich-
igan football head coach,
Stephen Henderson, the
editorial page editor of
the Detroit Free Press,
and Raquel Castaneda-
Lopez, a member of the
Detroit City Council.
It will also move
to Belle Isle from the
Brightmoor neighbor-
hood, which is meant to

symbolize the organiza-
tion's commitment to
representing the entire
the city. Sier said Belle
Isle is "integral" to how
people view Detroit.
"We've emphasized
the strength of the com-
munity and bonding to-
gether to be able to work
together on these proj-
ects," he said. "But we
really wanted to show
people physical strength
as well. Detroit isn't just
your charity case. It's a
strong city with a lot of
vitality."
"We're trying to have
a transformative year for
DP Day to reflect that it's
a transformative year for
Detroit and we need to
change as it's changing,"
he added.day," she said
of Friday's event. "I think
coming at night adds a lit-
tle bit of a different vibe
than you get during the
day."

FIVE THINGS TO
TAKE AWAY
FROM DP DAY
1. The symbol for DP Day this
year is the fist of Joe Louis.
"The Fist" symbolizes the
strength of the city and its
fight against injwustice.
2. DP Day is about service-
learning. After DP Day, think
not only about the work
you did, but the community
members you met and what
you learned.
3. Reflect on the experiences
you had and the how your
identities, background, and
perceptions influenced your
service.
4. The Detroit Partnership
is more than just DP Day.
We have weekly volunteer
opportunities and campus-
wide education events.
5. DP Day is just one day, but
it doesn't have to be.

Patrick Sier

25-9 with five abstentions.
The event garnered national
attention as hundreds of
students crowded the Mich-

r Faerber factor: Michigan's new weapon

Rescued from
death as an infant,
sophomore making
a splash for the
Wolverines
ByMAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Timothy Faerber is flying
through the air.
While the rest of the Michigan
men's swimming team goes
to the locker room and ices its
muscles, Faerber is still flying.
One rotation, a tuck, an
extension, and then Faerber
enters the water.
"Over! You're over!" shouts
diving coach KZ Li from the
deck, letting the sophomore
know he rotated a few degrees
too many. Faerber bobs back up
above the water, paddling to the
wall and propping himself onto
the deck. He nods his head at
Li, and then turns to a reporter,
sitting two chairs down.
"Is it OK if I do one more?"
he asks, as if he's bound by the
reporter's schedule and not the
other way around.
Faerber gets back up on the
board and does another. He over-
rotates again.
"One more. I'm really sorry."
This time, he hits it clean. His
rotation is fluid and his splash is
minimal.
Michigan
coach Mike
Bottom isn't
seeing any "Last ye
of this. He's
wrapped up focused
in adjusting
the strokes of trying tc
the women fr
swimming laps for m
in the middle
segment of the -
pool.
And that's not all that
surprising. Old habits die hard,
and diving hasn't been an
integral part of the season for
the second-ranked Wolverines.
While their swimmers grace the
covers of Swim World Magazine
and dominate the conversation
on online swimming forums,
Faerber and the dive team fly
under the radar.
But that won't always be the
case. Faerber's making sure of
that.
Ten days earlier, Faerber
stood 10 meters above the water,
at the same pool, preparing
for his final dive at the Big Ten
Championships.
For once, his whole team was
watching.
With 32 feet of free fall
between his feet and the water,
the sophomore took a deep
breath before jumping.
"I'm still scared," Farter
said later, laughing at himself. "I
guess I'd be less scared if I had
never messed up. But IShave."
But he knows there's only one
way down, and that's to jump.

Understanding the natural
dangers of a 32-foot fall,
Faerber clears his head and
takes the plunge.
On this dive, he didn't mess up.
When Faerber hit the water, the
home crowd erupted instantly.
That morning, Faerber had
become the first Michigan diver
in 11 years to make the finals in
all three diving disciplines. And
with that dive, he had just placed
fourth in his second consecutive
event, despite qualifying eighth
at each height.
That was a feat Bottom
couldn't possibly miss. In his
five-year tenure - which has
included four Big Ten titles
and a national championship -
Bottom had never had a diver
perform as well as Faerber.
A year earlier, no one could
have seen this coming.
For Faerber, the journey to
that moment on the 10-meter
platform couldn't have had many
more obstacles.
On Oct. 25, 1994, Tim Faerber
was dead.
At birth, he inhaled bodily
acid, which was dissolving
his lungs as his umbilical cord
strangled him.
"Basically, I was born with
buds for lungs," Faerber said, as
if he had said it a hundred times
before.
Though he was clinically dead,
doctors tied off his carotid artery
and hooked
- him up to an
experimental
ar, I was new machine
in an attempt
on just to circulate his
do well blood. No one
before him had
self,, ever survived
y} . the procedure
without
- complications.
People
had made it, but not without
limitations.
It was a miracle that he
lived at all, let alone that, seven
years later, he began diving
competitively.
It's clear in the way Faerber
speaks about his unusual birth
that it hasn't played a serious
role in his identity. He's thought
about it, sure, just like he thinks
about what could or could not
happen every time he stands
atop the 10-meter platform. But
in no way does it define him.
Still, that didn't stop him from
tryingto reconnect with the man
who saved his life. The doctor
who invented the experimental
procedure - whose name
Faerber doesn't even remember
- now works at the University of
Michigan Hospital.
"When I came here for a
recruiting trip, I actually sent
him an e-mail," Faerber said. "I
thought he would be interested
in talking to me, but he never
responded. I still would love to
talk with him."
When Faerber arrived at

Michigan in the fall of 2012, Li
saw a completely different man
than the one who wowed the
entire pool deck at the Big Ten
Championships.
"A lot of guys, when they get
to university, theythink it will be
easy. They don't want to work,"
Li said. "They want to have fun."
That attitude, Li thinks,
worked its way into Faerber's
mind during his freshman year.
Coming in, he had just
qualified for the Olympic Trials
straight out of the junior national
diving circuit.
At the time, though, he didn't
have enough confidence in two
of his nine dives off the 10-meter
platform, leading him to skip the
trials.
He chose to miss the chance to
compete against the nation's top
talent.
"Itwasthe fearthing," Faerber
said. "I'll regret (not going) for
the rest of my life."
Once he got to Ann Arbor,
he learned, the hard way, the
importance of correcting his
attitude - including the type of
mindset that led him to skip the
trials.
He struggled to keep pace
with tough engineering classes
and missed a few early-morning
practices. He didn't immediately
find his place on the team.
He misjudged the level of
competition he was up against in
the pool and out of it.
"I forgot about the school
part," Faerber said. "It was not a
good year for me in a lot of ways.
I came in thinking (diving) was
going to be easy like it was in
juniors. And it wasn't. There are
people in college you've never
heard of. I thought, having gone
to all the national meets, I would
have already heard of everyone."
The Big Ten's loaded field of
divers overwhelmed the still-
maturing Faerber, who finished
24th, 18th and 10th in the
1-meter, 3-meter and 10-meter,
respectively, at the conference
meet his freshman year.
Beyond that, physical
exhaustion, coupled with atough
transition period in the College
of Engineering, made Faerber's
first year at Michigan arduous.
"We offered him, a few times,

the chance to stop," Li s
told him 'Hey, you've go

Michigan's starting guards
are 6-foot-2, 6-foot-6 and
6-foot-6. Tennessee's are 6-foot-
1, 6-foot-6 and 6-foot-6.
But the similarities in size
get quickly obscured by the
differences in style.
The Michigan men's
basketball team works its
offense around the perimeter
- playing off of ball screens
and finding drive-and-kick
opportunities. The Wolverines
rotate the ball quickly and look
to exploit cracks in the defense
with prolific 3-point shooting.
The 11th-seeded Volunteers,
meanwhile, work the ball from
the inside out. The guards
- Antonio Barton, Jordan
McRae and Josh Richardson -
don't generate the offense like
Michigan's guards do.
Six-foot-eight, 260-pound
wunderkind Jarnell Stokes gets
alotoftouches and passes out of
double teams when opponents
give him attention in the post.
The junior forward is averaging
20 points and 15 rebounds in
the NCAA Tournament, but
has just as many assists on the
season as Barton, the starting
point guard.

eter. Tuesday. "It
will be a tough
cover again.
Their offense
pretty much
flows through him, and he leads
in points and assists, so it will
be crucial to get him out of his
rhythm."
But just in case that sounds
like Richardson is worried
about the matchup...
"It's just another player,"
he said. "I have been guarding
guys like that for a while now.
It's nothing new."
Richardson is the team's
second-leading scorer behind
McRae, and he led Tennessee
with 26 points on 9-for-13
shooting in Sunday's 83-63
pummeling of Mercer.
Though he won't command
a lot of attention behind the
3-point line, his shooting has

improved in the last few weeks.
Similar to a handful of Texas
players last week, Richardson
is most effective putting up
floaters and mid-range jumpers.
According to Tennessee
coach Cuonzo Martin,
Richardson went through some
of the same self-efficacy doubts
as sophomore forward Glenn
Robinson III.
"Iknowas aplayersometimes
coach wanted me to shoot the
ball, and I wasn't as assertive
early in my career to shoot the
ball," Martin said, analogizing
himself to Richardson. "But it
is how he is feeling, and if his
shots are going, he is aggressive,
he is going to be extremely
tough to defend."
McRae, however, is
Tennessee's major scoring
threat. In many ways, he
resembles the man he'll most
likely guard - sophomore
guard Caris LeVert. Both
players are listed at 6-foot-6
and 185 pounds, and both have
long, lanky limbs that help
them deflect balls in the passing
lanes, jump stop into the paint
and finish with either hand on
either side of the rim - over and
around the outstretched arms
of post defenders.
The Tennessee senior
averages 18.6 points per game,
but even if he, along with the
rest of the Volunteers are on
top of their games Friday night,
Martin knows that still may not
be enough.
"The (Wolverines) shoot it

very well," Martin said. "We
have to contest that line. But the
thing about it is ... they run their
plays, and it's almost like you
would like for them to score out
of their set plays because when
the set plays break down, they
have four guys that can take you
off the dribble and make plays
and make shots.
"The margin for error is very
slim."
NOTE: Wednesday, Stauskas
was named a first team All-
American by the National
Association of Basketball
Coaches. He is the eighth
Michigan player to receive the
distinction. The last was Trey
Burke in 2013.

*the two statements are unrelated

Lawrence leads bookish Wolverines

By MAX BULTMAN
DailySports Writer
When the Michigan softball
team went on Winter Break,
Carol Hutchins gave them
homework.
The Michigan coach gave
each player a copy of Tim S.
Grover's Relentless: From Good

to Great to Unstoppable, a book
meant to teach athletes how to
harness their intensity and turn
it into killer instinct.
Early in the season, it looks
as though the Wolverines have
done their homework and done
it diligently.
After splitting 10 games with
ranked teams in non-conference

play, Michigan (3-0 Big Ten, 22-6
overall) thumped Indiana by a
combined 29-4 in three games
over the weekend.
The clearest example of that
offseason growth comes with
sophomore outfielder Sierra
Lawrence. While she had
already earned a first team All-
Big Ten distinction last season,
Lawrence has played at a new
level this year.
"She has great hands, she has a
great eye, but her timing was just
off," Hutchins said. "Her timing
is a lot better this year, and her
confidence is a lot better. And
that's the goal - you want them
to get better from year to year."
In her standout freshman
campaign, Lawrence batted .314
with 38 RBI and seven home runs
in 63 games. Those are tough
numbers to improve on for any
player, freshman or otherwise.
But through 25 appearances
this season, she's hitting.357
with 28 RBI and three home
runs already.
All of it, Lawrence says, is a
result of her offseason growth.
"I worked on everything,
basically," Lawrence said.
"Offense, defense, my mentality,
just everything."
Perhaps the most startling
aspect of her torrid pace is that it

has come against the nation's top
competition - something she
won't see much of for the rest of
the regular season.
"For (Lawrence), the sky is the
limit," Hutchins said. "I thought
she had a ton of untapped
potential last year."
That potential is showing itself
everytime Lawrencecomestobat.
Whereas the Wolverines have
faltered from time to time with
runners in scoring position,
Lawrence has come through to
the tune of a.429 batting average
and 28 RBI.
She has been even better with
the bases loaded, when she's gone
4-for-5 with two grand slams.
"I just know my team is
looking up to me and expecting
me to step up when it's time,"
Lawrence said.
That kind of attitude
resonates through the whole
team. Senior outfielders Nicole
Sappingfield and Lyndsay Doyle
have made similar comments
after clutch hits late in games,
and it's somewhat of a catch
phrase for Romero.
That's no accident.
Hutchins handpicks books
like Relentless to instill that
mindset in her players, and it
works.

Stamps highlights
Penelope Spheeris

'Wayne's World'
director to speak at
Michigan Theater
By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
DailyArts Writer
The Penny W. Stamps
Speaker Series aims to
bring the best emerging and
established
artists to Stamps
engage withS
the University Speaker
and the Series:
community as Penelope
a whole.
In conjunc- Spheeris
tion with the Thursday
Ann Arbor March 27
Film Fes-
tival, the Michigan Theater
Penny Stamps Free
Speaker
Series will
welcome director, writer and
producer Penelope Spheeris.
Spheeris is best known for
directorial works, including
the highly influential
"Decline of Western
Civilization" documentary
series and comedy films like
"Wayne's World" and "The
Little Rascals."
Recently, an effort to
restore Spheeris' work has
begun, including her student
films from UCLA, some of
which will be shown at the
Ann Arbor Film Festival. As
part of her Stamps lecture,
Spheeris will be talking about
her films unique relationship
with music.
"We called it 'Rock and
Roll Anthropology' because
my career really was started
and based in music from the
very beginning," Spheeris
said. "And music has had
a real big part in all of my
films. So we're really talking
about how music has inspired
me as a filmmaker to make
movies."
While Spheeris'
filmography - with a healthy
mix of independent, feature
and documentary film -
makes it seem like she's had
the pick of her projects, that's
not necessarily the case.

"When people say I have
an eclectic body of work, yes
it's very, very true, but it's
because I took whatever job I
could get," Spheeris said.
Surprisingly, that didn't
change after she directed
1992's massive hit "Wayne's
World."
"Once I got 'Wayne's
World,' I was only offered
comedies, and goofy comedies
at that."
Spheeris spoke about the
gender issues that underlined
her situation and that contin-
ue to affect women directors
today.
"When you're a woman in
this business," Spheeris said,
"You take what work you can
get. It's really difficult."
"Guys have the luxury of
picking and choosing," she
continued. "Male directors
can make a film that fails big
time and then get arrested
the next week for drunk driv-
ing and they can keep making
movies. But women have to
really walk the line and take
whatever they can get."
Compounding these dif-
ficulties, Spheeris said there
was a dearth of female men-
tors when she started her
c areer.
"There are more women
directors than when I start-
ed," Spheeris said. "I mean,
I really didn't have any role
models to look towards. When
I was a 25 year-old starting
out in the business, I didn't
have a 40 year-old woman
director to use as a role model.
There just weren't any."
Unfortunately, the uptick
in female directors has not
balanced out the power
dynamics in Hollywood, and
Spheeris doesn't see it hap-
pening any time soon.
"Are there more of us?"
Spheeris said. "Yes. Are we
equal? Far from it. Do I ever
see in the crystal ball a time
when women would take over
the world of film directing? I
can't imagine, a nd it's really
too bad."
When talking about her
favorite movie she's made,
Spheeris touched on the dif-

ficulty her films have faced
in regards to distribution and
music rights.
"My personal favorite is
Decline of Western Civiliza-
tion Part 3," Spheeris said.
"That's the one no one's seen,
because the only way I could
get it distributed was if I gave
away rights to the other mov-
ies and I wouldn't do it. So no
one's seen it and it was heart-
breaking. But you know I did
a movie with Sharon and Ozzy
called 'We Sold Our Souls for
Rock 'n' Roll' and it's never
been seen either because of
rights issues."
Spheeris also spoke about
the financial difficulties fac-
ing new directors trying to
makeit in the industry.
"Right now it's sort of the
same thing going on with the
class in America," Spheeris
said. "The upper class is doing
very, very well and that will
equate to high budget stu-
dio temple movies, and then
you got those little tiny mov-
ies that are doing kind of ok,
but everything in the middle
is just lost. And it's too bad
because there are a lot of good
movies in there that we just
don't get to see."
The situation is so dire that
Spheeris expressed doubt as
to if she would even become a
filmmaker today.
"If it were me starting out
today, given the landscape
and the calamity that's going
on out there because of the
technology, I don't even know
if I would do it today, honest-
ly," Spheeris said. "You had
to be very committed back
then, especially if you were a
woman, but you have to be a
1000 percent more committed
to do it today. I don't mean to
be discouraging, but I feel like
I have to be honest about it."
While her main goal is get-
ting the "Decline" films dis-
tributed, Spheeris is also in
talks for several other film
and television projects.
"I've got a lot of things
going. I always do," Spheeris
said. "You've got to in Holly-
wood, and just hope that one
of them sticks to the wall.

Juicy J performs at the Crofoot Ballroom in Pontiac.

Juicy Jfin ally getting
the success he deserves.
But at what cost?

CHECK THE FILTER FOR THE LATEST
POP CULTURE NEWS

It's a little after 11 p.m., and
I'm at the Crofoot Ballroom in
Pontiac, Mich. waiting for Juicy J
to come on.
Suddenly, -
the lights
shut off,
Juicy's
DJ cues
up some
music and
Mr. Trippy
himself
struts on
stage to the JACKSON
looming H
synths of HOWARD
"Stop It."
"Who's
fucked up
tonight?" Juicy screams, to the
delight of the crowd. He smiles.
Business as usual:
Or so it seems. Three years
ago, I saw Juicy play the House
of Blues in Hollywood, Calif.
At that point, in 2011, Juicy had
barely established himself as
a solo artist and only had a few
mixtapes to his name, certainly
not a relevant studio album. The
show was absolute chaos. Juicy
ran out with a bottle of Bombay
gin and poured it all over the
crowd and stage, massive girls
with even more massive asses
twerked on stage for Juicy's
approval and the show itself had
to actually stop for a second due
to the brawl that erupted in the
mosh pit between two large men
wearingOaklandRaidersjerseys.
At that show, Juicy performed
strictly mixtape material, and it
felt like everyone who was sober
enough to rap along knew the
words. These were not songs you
heard on the radio; instead it was
a set of classic tape anthems like
"Get Higher," "Zip And A Double
Cup," "Riley" and "Pills Weed
Pussy."
At the House of Blues that
night, Juicy's antics - twerking
contests, blunt smoking, Bombay
gin dancing (check out his aptly
named song, "Bombay Gin
Dance"), riling the crowd up -
felt genuine. Sure, the people
at the show came to bask in the
hedonistic ignorance that is
Juicy J, but Juicy didn't have to
front and play along. He knew
why we were there, that we had
downloaded his mixtapes from
obscure internet sites, that we
had been down with him since
the "Sippin' on Some Syrup" and
"Slob on MyKnob" Three 6fMafia
days.
Look, the last thing I want to
be is the fan that says some shit
like, "I hate so-and-so because
they blew up." Because in terms
of me and Juicy, that's just false.
I love how big he's become; I
applauded him for linking up
with Wiz Khalifa's Taylor Gang
imprint and freaked out when
I saw he was featured on a Katy
Perry single. I love that crazy
motherfucker Juicy and I'll
support him through whatever.
He deserves it.
But I can't help comparing my
recent experience of seeing Juicy
perform in 2014 - in promotion of
his new studio album - to seeing
peak mixtape-era Juicy play in
2011. First and foremost, I was
shocked atthe audience.Now,this
might sound ridiculous coming

from a white college student like
myself, but the Pontiac show was
majority white college students,
mostly frat bros and various
drunk chicks grinding in front of
them. There were so many white
people that when Juicy pulled
girls up on stage to take selfies -
some ridiculous shit that he never
would've done before - he had
to actively seek out a Black girl
because he could only find white
ones.
Okay, I know what you're
thinking and let me be really
quick to defend myself: I really
don't care about the race of the
people at a concert. I truly don't.
But what killed me was the
population of white - and Black
and Latino and Asian - college
students who drunkenly sang
along to "Bandz A Make Her
Dance"andwhosehighlightofthe
night was when Juicy performed
his guest verse from Katy Perry's
"Dark Horse." Ironically, Juicy
went on an entire rant listing
his accomplishments - Oscar
winner, Three 6 Mafia founder -
and asked repeatedlytothe crowd
if they'd been fucking with him
since day one. The crowd roared.
Juicy proceeded to play almost
exclusively new music and guest
verses, which is fine, but when
he did drop a hint of some "day
one" material - comparatively,
his mixtapes are like "day seven"
stuff - there was no palpable
crowd reaction. No one knew it.
What really bummed me out
was when he played "Who Da
Neighbors," one of his classic
songs and also one of the craziest
songs ever recorded, and almost
no one knew the words! And these
are easy and really fun-ass words
to know: "My mansion sittin' on
40 acres / Who da neighbors?
/ Kobe Bryant from the Lakers
/ Now that's paper." Instead of
the massive tornado of hands
and moshing I expected, some
kids bobbed their heads, more
checked their phones and I was
left screaming every word alone
("Get money/get pussy/smoking
weed forever!"), whereas at the

last show I'm prettysure I rapped
the entire song face-to-face with
a shirtless guy with dreads who
let me hit his blunt.
The blame isn't with Juicy's
fans, though. Juicy's craft of
making explicit, drug-loving, sex-
encouraging, violence-provoking
music has become a novelty that,
like everything birthed on the
periphery of culture, has seeped
into the mainstream. Juicy has an
app with his own ad-libs, a solo
deal with Columbia and pop hit
maker Dr. Luke's own label and
finally got a No. 1 hit by getting
the feature on Perry's "Dark
Horse," which Dr. Luke himself
conveniently produced.
I sound like an asshole - I
know. But it was so weird for me
to see Juicy doing his usual antics
and craziness - screaming "Who
smokes weed?" and, pointing to a
skinny white kid, "You look like a
virgin. Gogetsomepussytonight!"
- and itfeelingforced. It'sbecome
performance art. Clad in black
with a fresh pair of Kanye's Nike
Red Octobers, Juicy looked like a
rap star and not the dude I came to
love from North Memphis. That's
okay, it reallyis, butI couldn't help
but yearn for the absolute chaos,
rawness and complete bliss of
that 2011 show, where it felt like
any minute Juicy would launch
himselfinto the crowd to hit ajoint
or smack someone.
I'm never going to stop
listening to Juicy J or Three 6
Mafia because I love the music
too damn much, and I also want
to keep supporting Juicy because
after over 20 years, he deserves
this success. But I'll forever hold
on to the memory of dripping
sweat, screaming till I was
hoarse and getting punched in
the stomach by a man the size of a
Volkswagen in the middle of that
House of Blues mosh pit as what
I know to be the real Juicy J, or
what he used to be, anyways.

GIFT OF ARTS
From Page 1B
It is now the Canamores' 63rd
day at the hospital, and every day
Jackie has goneto the hospital and
waited at her husband's bedside
from nine in the morning to five
in the evening. When we meet, she
sits down heavily in a wheelchair
in the hallway, with her husband
asleep in the room. She has red
hair and speaks with a folksy tone
pleasing to listen to.
"I've never seen a 64 year-old
color before," Canamore said. "But
I did, because I was so bored."
Reed pushes a cart packed
with small projects she gives
out to patients - bracelets,
pictures, coloring books. She had
given Canamore four bracelets
yesterday. Canamore made all
four bracelets, and she has since
given all four away, one to a valet
because she enjoyed watching him
with his family.
On that same floor on which
the Canamores reside, Merideth
Hume works as a unit host. Her
responsibilities include connect-
ing patients to the services offered
by the hospital, such as GOA.
"The question Mrs. Canamore
asked this morning was: 'When is
that gal coming around, you know,
with the art carts?"' Hume said.
The art cart Reed pushes

through the halls also carries
replacementsforthepicturesinthe
patient's room. She allows them to
pick out a painting they like, talks
to the patients about their choice,
giving them a history of the work
and the artist who painted it, and
she hangs the it. It's a small ges-
ture, but important nonetheless.
"I've noticed this over the years:
The artwork can make a huge dif-
ference," Hume said.
The eighth floor is dark and
somber, and in many ways,
separate from the rest of GOA's .
work. Downstairs, throughout
the corridors and waiting lobbies,
a passer-by will see evidence
of Sims's efforts hung on walls
and stood in display cases, often
with whimsical results. A clown
with fat marks of face paint doffs
his top hat. A frog carved from
wood stares mystic-eyed out
from the glass case into nothing,
skin crawling with little turtles
and frogs. Yet there is meditative
work, too, being displayed: a blue
rocking lawnchair, an oil canvas
painting of a window opening to
sunlight. Extravagant with art,
the landscape of this hospital is a
testament to GLAAH's movement
to enhance the landscape of
hospitals across the world.
Carrie McClintock, the
Communication Coordinator of
GOA, has degrees in both Fine
Arts and Performing Arts, having

studied at Rice University and the
University of Arizona.
"We've had staff tell us,"
McClintock said, "That when
they're busy, going back and forth
between differentprocedures, they
stop for a few moments, taking in
some of the art really calms them
down and makes them feel more
able to take on what's next."
She also explained that what
they do at GOA is not music and art
therapy; it's therapeutic music and
art - a distinction people often
miss.
"It's just for its own sake," she
said.
Yet there is also a sense of
solidarity in what GOA does. In
their most recent collaboration
with the University of Michigan,
GOA sought out the stories of both
patients and staff - their wishes,
hopes and dreams - which were
then written down on blue pieces
of paper and given over to School
Art & Design Prof. Anne Mondro.
She and her class then folded the
pieces of paper into round fans
- 1700 in all - into a design by
an artist named Katy Bergman
Cassell. Those stories are now
rippling 16 feet in length in the
form of a surging blue dragon. It
is called the Dragon of Wishes,
Hopes and Dreams-- a permanent
fixture in the University Hospital.

formation, so it's very appropriate

As I leave the quiet hours of the

to the main floor of the hospital.
I pass the exhibits and galleries
one more time. A few people stop
and peer at the paintings, some
stooping with their hands in their
pockets, and move on to the next
display. Outside in the courtyard,
where GOA hosts outdoor concerts
in the summer and spring, there is
a small garden called the Friends
Meditation Garden. In the winter,
it is chained off, covered in snow,
empty.
In the main floor lobby next to
the wall is an exhibit showcasing
an antiquated office of a doctor
from another time. It lays behind a
wall of glass. Everything inside sits
perfect, unmoving - unsettling.
Below, a short paragraph explains
how hospitals were once charity

physicians the only reliable source
of healthcare, and times were
changed. When I finish reading,
I look around at the paintings of

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

The Art Pop Film "G.U.Y." is
unusual for a music video, but
expectedly eccentric for Lady
Gags. The production starts
off with a gang
of business-
men in a full
out brawl over G UY
money that is LadyGaga
cluttered all Interscope
over an open
field. The cam-
era zooms in on Lady Gaga in
a bird costume that has been
struck by an arrow, and then .
depicts her struggling across
the plane.
Magically, the bird/person
somehow manages to make
it to the gates of what looks
like a modern Oz. Guards
in stylized trash bags pick
her up and parade her in a
pose that is reminiscent of a
crucifix through the vibrant
and expansive open-air palace
that lies behind the gates as
dancers shimmy around them.
Finally, the guards hand

over her body to a synchro-
nized swim team and the more
substantial music video por-
tion starts.
It definitely "heats up" from
here - Lady Gaga is displayed
in a nude pose, only cevered by
a blanket and pantyhose.-The
shoot primarily alters between
various stages - the pool at the
palace with Perez Hilton in the
sky, an Egyptian scene with an
indoor pool, a dance sequence
with the lights dimmed and
then a contrasting bright white

scene with reefs overhead. The
video closes with an inunda-
tion of men in suits exiting the
gates of the massive landscape.
On the whole, Lady Gaga's
"G.U.Y." is a wildly creative
video with an expectedly
bizarre flair. If the videoitself
doesn't impress, then the four
minutes of credits rolling for
this seven-minute video prove
how much time and effort
went into this over-the-top
production.

EPISODE REVIEW

TRAILER REVIEW

"Bates Motel" has never
shied away from its inherent
strangeness. When you're:a

story of a
too-close-
for-comfort Bates Motel
mother and Check-Out
son - a story
that ends A&E
with the
mother's corpse rotting in the
basement - there's no option
but to embrace the crazy. And
in that vein, "Motel" 's latest
episode, "Check-Out," does
not disappoint.
"Check-Out" is "Bates
Motel" 's most significant
reminder of its source mate-
rial. The prequel to one of
Hitchcock's most iconic
films, "Bates Motel" had con-
tinually dropped hints about
Norman's future in season
one - his blackouts, his
fascination with taxidermy.
But in "Check-Out," Norman

Abroad, wooden-framed mir-

The episode's climax was

Sure, "Oculus" would seem

multitude of converging themes:
historical drama, family disin-

mystery, semblances of time

the basic horror-movie template
to create a good scare, "Oculus"
utilizes depth of character and
a multi-faceted storyto drive
home a serious mental, emotion-
al and spiritual fright fest.

A RT ATTACK
Kids engage with
the arts at UMMA

AR TIST PROILE

Art education alive
and kicking at
Museum
By ADAM DEPOLLO
OnlineArts Editor
In the age of No Child
Left Behind and its latest
incarnation, the Common
Core State Standards, arts
education has slowly faded
from prominence in public
school curricula as districts
struggle to meet education
standards with shrinking
budgets and increasing class
sizes. Politicians questioning
the economic value of non-
STEM education often single
out the fine arts, in particular,
as a subject with no practical
use - President Obama
recently recommended that
young people forego an art
history degree in favor of jobs
in skilled manufacturing.
Arts education is, however,
very much alive and kicking at
centers of higher learning like
the University of Michigan.
The University of Michigan
Museum of Art provides the
entire University and Ann
Arbor community with access
to a fluid collection of artwork
from around the world while
offering a wide variety of
tours, performances, films
and lectures aimed at creating
a learning environment and
benefitting the public.
In addition to its work
in Ann Arbor, Ruth Slavin,
UMMA's deputy director
for education, explained
that UMMA has, in recent
years, expanded its services
to reach learners of all ages
and provide opportunities for
kids to interact with art on a
personal level.
"We've always had ahealthy
elementary school population
that comes - we serve about
5,000 kids a year through that
elementary school program,"
Slavin said.
Aside from the area
immediately surrounding
the University, UMMA has
expanded its educational
outreach programs to include
22 different school districts
and 16 independent schools
from across Michigan. The
proximity of local Washtenaw
County schools allows for
closer working relationships
with the museum, however.
"We have a partnership
with Ypsilanti High School,
where each high school
student is coming at least once
this year, and 11th and 12th
graders are coming twice. So
we serve about 400 students
through that program," Slavin

said.
Serving more than 5,000
students each year can be a
challenge, especially for a
small museum like UMMA.
But, as Slavin explained, the
museum's small size allows
UMMA to provide unique
experiences for its K-12
visitors.
"We don't have any canned
tours," she said.
The museum works to tailor
its tours to each group of
students that comes through
its doors and to provide an
educational experience that
goes beyond the limitations of
a particular subject.
"With Ypsilanti High
School this year, Pamela
Reister, my colleague, really
worked in depth to find out
what the kids are studying and
to make connections, not only
between content and subject
matter but also between
skills that they might be
learning," Slavin said. "Let's
say it's writing essays and
making an argument - then
we look at a work of art and
pose a question in response
to which you could form an
argument. And then you look
for evidence in the work of art
and outside the work of art."
Recent grants from the
National Endowment for the
Arts and the Community
Foundation of Southeast
Michigan have also helped
UMMA expand the use of
technology in its educational
programming. Aside from
purchasing a number of iPads
to add digital media to gallery
walks, the museum has been
able to expand its online
presence and provide remote
access to its collections.
"We have a content
management tool for the
museum called 'Many Voices,'
which allows teachers
and students to explore
the museum from their
classroom," Slavin said. "If
kids come and do the 'Art
Rocks' tour, they can then go
back and the teacher can get
the media that was shown
on the iPad digitally through
that interface."
Although UMMA receives
fewer school visits during the
summer when classes aren't in
session, it continues to provide
educational programming
for K-12 students throughout
the year. The museum's
summer programs provide
an even more intimate and
personalized experience for
students.
"Usually the kids come for
an extended period ... and
the idea is to make a vivid,
fun, creative and exploratory
experience for the kids, to

not only boost their specific
learning but also provide
motivation for learning and
excitement," Slavin said. "It's
pretty special, you know, a lot
of times they get to be in the
museum when it's not open to
other people. It's a pretty nice
feeling, going from thinking
'I don't know if that's a place
for me,' to thinking 'Wow,
I've got this special behind-
the-scenes experience.'"
UMMA also partners with
the School of Education
to provide an immersive
program for students learning
English as a second language.
"There the kids wrote plays,
wrote poems, did artworks,
planned speeches and then
there was a night where their
parents came in addition to
the student-teachers and
teachers for a demonstration
of their learning across
many art forms," Slavin said.
"For some of those parents
that was the first time that
they had seen their kid in an
English performance. I came
that night just to see and I
was kind of, just floating on
a cloud, because I thought,
you know, this is really what
can happen when you have a
partnership."
At UMMA, arts education
isn't an end in and of itself.
As the museum's programs
for ESL, English as a Second
Language, students and its
individually tailored tours
demonstrate, the arts can be
an important tool for helping
students develop skills that
will serve them in all of their
academic subjects.
"If a kid is uncomfortable
here and not excited about art
and they just go home with
facts, we don't consider that
a uccess," Slavin said. "It's
all about motivation to learn
more. It's all about sparking
curiosity, making them
comfortable and moving their
knowledge along a little bit."
When education is limited
by an endless stream of stan-
dardized tests and pre-pre-
scribed curricula, it's easy to
lose the sense of wonder one
feels when grappling with
deep questions and the appre-
ciation for the world possible
through the acquisition of
knowledge. Arts education at
UMMA, as Slavin explained,
is best viewed as a way to keep
that sense of wonder alive.
"We try to look for the big
issues and the big questions
that art can raise that aren't
in a vacuum in the art world,
but spread out to science,
spread out to literature,
politics, social life, history,
because that's what makes it
interesting."

Professor of Theater Malcolm Tulip attended the prestigious Lecoq School.
T
Tulip: A m-a ftesae

By ADAM DEPOLLO
Online Arts Editor
Malcolm Tulip is, above all,
a man of the stage. Over the
course of his career, the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance
Associate Professor of Theater
has worked in all facets of
theatrical production - as an
actor, director, playwright and
choreographer.
The many strands of Tulip's
work, however, are tied togeth-
er by his love for the physical
spectacle of theater - a love
he developed in his native Lan-
caster, England, and honed into
his own personal style, begin-
ning with his training at the
Ecole Jacques Lecoq in Paris.
"I went there because the
training there was about two
things: One was a physical
approach to theater, which
means that, in some ways it's
the spectacle that counts,"
Tulip said. "This training is
a lot about how you get your
physical vocabulary to be able
to express whatever you want."
In his acting roles, Tulip
puts the command of physical
vocabulary he developed at
the Lecoq School on display.
In one of his productions, the
one man show "I Am My Own
Wife," Tulip took on the role of
Charlotte von Marlesburg, an
East German transvestite, and
34 other characters during the
course of two hours.
"The training I had with
changing physicality in a bold
way from character to char-
acter really came into play,"
Tulip said. "And it's not just the
shape that you take on, it's then
the quality of movement, what
kind of gestures each char-
acter makes, some shameless
use of accents. I mean there's
one scene with Charlotte and,
I think, eight reporters from
around the world."
Tulip's study of clowning
and vaudeville also informs
his approach to acting and his
original works. He teaches a
class on clowning for senior
