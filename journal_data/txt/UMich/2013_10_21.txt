School's endowment
grows to $8.4 billion,
10.75-percent ROI.
By SAM GRINGLAS and
JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily Staff Reporters
FLINT, Mich. - On Friday, Tim
Slottow, the University's executive
vice president and chief financial
officer, announced that the institu-
tion's endowment reached an all-
time high of $8.4 billion in fiscal
year 2013, which ended on June 30.
The endowment grew from $7.7
billion to $8.4 billion over the fis-
cal year with an annualized invest-
ment return of 10.75 percent. tts
highest value previously was $7.8
billion in fiscal year 2011.
The endowment is the second
largest in the nation for public
universities and the seventh larg-
est among all universities in the
U.S., according to findings by the
National Association -of College,
and University Business Officers
and the Commonfund. Over the
past 13 years, the endowment has
increased from the fiscal year
of 2000's total of $3.5 billion -

attributable to both significant
fundraising efforts and investment
strategy.
However, the University's
endowment on a per-student basis
ranks 0o1st - lower than most top-
tier private universities with much
smaller student bodies than the
university.
L. Erik Lundberg, the Univer-
sity's chief investment officer, said
in an interview he estimates that
new donations to the endowment
accounted for about $200 million
of the increase in the 2013 fiscal
year.
The University holds a 10-year
annualized investment return of
10.2 percent. When the investment
office was established 14 years ago,
the endowment had an annualized
rate of return of 9.6 percent. The
University's total cash and invest-
ments reached $10 billion for the
first time as of June 30, according
to the University's annual invest-
ment report.
The distributions from the
endowment help fund a host of
programs, scholarships and pro-
fessorships at the University -
totaling $276 million in outlays
for the 2013 fiscal year - a slight

event at Ross
By ADAM GLANZMAN
Daily StaffReporter
About 550 students, faculty
and sports business profession-
als gathered in the Ross School

of Business Friday morning
to attend the second annual
Michigan Sports Business Con-
ference.
The day-long conference
included speeches from CBS
Sports Anchor Dana Jacobson,
ESPN president John Skipper,
and Tom Garfinkel, the presi-
dent and CEO of the Miami
Dolphins football team, among
many others.

Kinesiology junior David
Herman and Kinesiology
senior Michael Freedman, co-
presidents of the MSBC, led a
32-member student planning
committee that worked for the
past year to organize and suc-
cessfully execute the event.
The MSBC Advisory Board,
composed entirely of Michigan
alumni, helped facilitate inter-
actions between students and

business professionals, making
the high-profile speakers at the
event possible.
"Our board of advisors usu-
ally make that initial connec-
tion and we take it over from
there," Herman said. "It's only
with their help, their Michigan
connections, their professional
connections, that we can really
gain legitimate access to such

The Mujo Cafe in the North Cam-

24 hours for half of the week, Cen-
tral Student Government President
Michael Proppe announced Sunday
evening.
This comes after similar changes
to the hours of Bert's Cafe in the

in January. Mujo will be open all
hours from Sunday to Wednesday
starting Monday. It will be open
until 2 a.m. on Thursdays, 5 p.m. on
Fridays and8 p.m. on Saturdays.
Proppe said CSG wanted to see
the success of Bert's new hours
before making the change in North
Campus.
Proppe said the timing should
help students working late for mid-
terms. CSG is trying to be more vocal

FLINT, Mich. - The Board of
Regents approved an array of con-
struction projects at their October
meeting on Friday, including bids
and schematic designs for renova-
tions across campus.
The Earl V. Moore Building reno-
vation is set to proceed after tho

room spaces and the construction
of an additional wing including a
lecture hall, performance space and

Maize and Blue

ByAMRUTHASIVAKUMAR

DETROIT - Pink doesn't
clash with maize and blue
- it's more of a complement,
really.

At a "chic tailgate" in
Detroit's Cadillac Square
on Friday, the University of
Michigan Health System
hosted the first-ever "Maize
and Blue Go Pink" benefit for
breast cancer research at the
University's Comprehensive
Cancer Center.
The Comprehensive Can-
cer Center - founded in 1986
- uses new and innovative
medical techniques in its

cancer research and clinical
practices. Ryan Davis, asso-
ciate director of the Com-
prehensive Cancer Center,
said rapid advancements in
the center's Breast Oncology
Program convinced directors
that a fundraiser would help
support its growth.
Members of the alumni
marching band and Detroit
Pistons cheerleaders wel-
comed attendees as they

moved into a "strolling din-
ner." Davis said UMHS hopes
"Maize and Blue Go Pink"
will become an annual event.
Clad in maize, blue and
pink, attendees watched a
fashion show that featured
items from the Somerset Col-
lection in Troy, Mich. Uni-
versity affiliates who walked

English Dept. unveils new
Fifty years ago this week Twenty-five years ago this
(Oct. 20,1963): week (Oct.25,1988):

The University English
Department began its use of a
new format for English classes,
dividing the semester into two-
week units. Each unit .would
begin with a lecture discussing
an idea in regard to a previously
assigned essay.
Additionally, the semester
included five writing confer-
ences so students could receive
one-on-one assistance from
instructors.
The format intended to help
transition teaching fellows into
the course and provide students
with more experienced instruc-
tors.

The student group Sa'lam
Shalom, an Arab-Jewish peace
project, held its first meeting to
discuss conflict in the Middle
East.
The students expressed
appreciation for the opportu-
nity to discuss both sides of the
conflict in the Middle East with
students with different opin-
ions.
Ten years ago this week
(Oct. 24,2003):
Construction began on a new
addition to the School of Public
Health. The addition replaced

class format
a wing of the Henry F. Vaughan
Building and added new class-
rooms, conference rooms and
research space.
The addition also included
construction of the School of
Public Health connector bridge
across Washington Heights
Street.
At the ground-breaking
event, University President
Mary Sue Coleman emphasized
the innovative research and
achievements by the School of
Public Health.
Construction was completed
in 2006.

Regents will hold January
meeting in New York

Athletic Dept. outlines
plans for South Campus

Board will hold
'strategic planning
session' in place of
normal meeting
By PETER SHAHIN,
JENNIFER CALFAS and SAM
GRINGLAS
Daily NewsEditor and
Daily StaffReporters
FLINT, Mich. - Rewgent
Andrea Fischer Newman (R)
announced at Friday's Board of
Regents meeting that the govern-
ing board will travel to New York
City for a "strategic planning ses-
sion" in place of their January
2014 meeting.
While in the Big Apple, the
regents will discuss the impor-
tance of university medical
centers with a host of higher
education leaders, including
Princeton University presi-

dent Christopher Eisgruber and
Yale University president Peter
Salovey, as well as former admin-
istrators from Johns Hopkins
University and Emory University.
Last January, the regents
attended sessions in California
to discuss the challenges facing
higher education with Robert
Birgeneau, recently retired chan-
cellor of the University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley; Stanford University
President John Hennessy; Robert
Berdahl, former president of the
Association of American Univer-
sities; and Dan Russell, one of
Google's top research scientists.
California is the most well-rep-
resented state at the University
besides Michigan, with 2,282
Californians enrolled in classes,
according to enrollment data
released Wednesday.
The second largest body of
non-resident students hails from
New York, with 2,102 students
calling the state home. The state
is also home to a large number of

*uzaciuu

alumni.
With the trip scheduled a few
months after the capital cam-
paign launch on Nov. 8, Newman
also said the University plans to
meet with donors and alumni
during their excursion. Universi-
ty alum Stephen Ross, chair of the
upcoming Victors for Michigan
campaign and a resident of New
York city, will also host a develop-
ment-focused event.
Jerry May, vice president for
development, attended last Janu-
ary's California trip along with
two University gift officers sta-
tioned in California. May did not
attend the Board's seminars and
meetings, but focused on con-
necting the regents with alumni
and. potential donors at two
events.
In January, University spokes-
man Rick Fitzgerald said the west
coast trip provided an opportuni-
ty to reach outto donors in a state
heavily populated with Univer-
sity alumni.
"This presents an opportunity.
to reach out to people who care
about the University and want
this institution to thrive well into
our third century," Fitzgerald
said last year.
In an e-mail interview before
the California trip, Regent Denise
Ilitch (D) expressed interest in
holding similar meetings in the
future.
"I look forward to more meet-
ings that allow us to learn,
exchange ideas and promote the
virtues of the University of Mich-
igan," Ilitch wrote. "It is vitally
important to be an 'ambassador'
of our great institution."

Fundraising
effort to focus
on all 16 projects
simultaneously
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
At the second annual Michi-
gan Sports Business Conference
held Friday at the Ross School
of Business, Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon and other
Athletic Department admin-
istrators explained upcoming
renovations to the University's
athletic campus and delved into
fundraising plans for the 16
improvement projects.
The projects, which Brandon
said will "touch every single
one of our student-athletes,"
were broken down into regions.
As reported previously, in the
northern area, which encom-
passes the traditional athletic
campus from Crisler Arena and
Michigan Stadium to Schem-
bechler Hall on State Street,
about 400,000 square feet of
new space will be constructed,
at an estimated price of $140
million in construction costs.
These estimates do not
include the planning costs,
which include architecture
fees, and are expected to add
about 30 to 40 percent to total
expenses.
The southern region, which
currently houses the tennis
facilities and women's gym-
nastics program, will add
roughly 308,000 square feet
of new space, at a cost of about
$120 million. The University's
golf course connects the two
regions and will also undergo
renovations.
Projects also include the con-
struction of a field hockey team
center and stadium, a multi-

purpose team center and new
administrative offices. The Ste-
phen Ross Academic Center will
be expanded,. Schembechler
Hall will be reconstructed and
new training facilities will be
built.
A new soccer and rowing
team center will be built in the
south, along with a lacrosse sta-
dium, training center and an
outdoor track.
Brandon said the Athletic
Department wanted to improve
conditions for all of Michigan's
31 programs to encourage even
better recruits to commit to
Michigan, even in less lucrative
sports. The department is hop-
ing to create a consistent expe-
rience among all programs.
"The question that all of
them ask themselves is, 'What
is the commitment level this
institution has for my sport,' "
Brandon said. "Their sport, in
their mind, is the most impor-
tant sport."
Brandon, while noting that
each Michigan football game
generates an estimated $14 mil-.
lion in economic benefit to the
region, stressed the importance
of the financial opportunity of
an enhanced athletic campus.
In order to hold conference
tournaments and champion-
ship events, there are standards
the facilities of each sport must
live up to, he said.
"We have an exciting oppor-
tunity to be a destination venue
that can bring excitement,
attention and dollars to this
community," he said. "We want
to have the types of facilities
that afford us the opportunity
to host those championships."
Chrissi Rawak, Michigan's
senior associate athletic direc-
tor for development, said the
fundraising for the new build-
ings is unique as compared to
projects at other universities
because instead of fundraising

for each individual project, the
money will be raised for all 16
projects at once.
"We're buying into one
.vision," Rawak said, referenc-
ing former Michigan football
coach Bo Schembechler's clas-
sic "the team, the team, the
team" mentality.
Though all donations will be
collected in one pot, the indi-
vidual donor's name will go to
the program he or she is pas-
sionate about. Rawak pointed to
University alum Stephen Ross,
who donated a historic $100
million for the campus, as evi-
dence that fundraising is going
well. The University's Board of
Regents approved naming the
new campus the Stephen M.
Ross Athletic Campus at Fri-
day's Board of Regents meeting
at the University's Flint cam-
pus.
Plans for the projects began
three years ago, and Rawak
estimates they will be com-
pleted in the next five to seven
years.
The first project, construc-
tion of new softball facilities,
will be completed in December.
Constructionof the field hockey
stadium willbegin immediately
following the completion of its
season next month, according
to Rob Rademacher, associate
athletic director for facilities.
Rawak said the Athletic
Department will put aside
$250,000 a year to proactively
address the increased opera-
tion costs that will result from
the addition ofnew buildings.
Contrary to rumors, student-
athletes will not live in separate
athletic dorms, but will remain
integrated in dorms on campus.
Brandon also addressed trans-
portation issues, saying the
department is working on inte-
grating plans for future trans-
portation services and solving
problems with parking.

DETROIT
Detroit officer
shot by fugitive
in April dies
Detroit police say one of their'
offices has died after sustaining
head wounds in a shootout with a
paroled armed robber and slaying
suspect six months ago.
Police spokeswoman Kelly
Miner tells the Detroit Free Press
that Officer Patrick Hill died
about 7:30 p.m. Saturday. She
declined to release other details.
The fugitive died in the April
2 shooting that followed a car
chase. Police say they were seek-
ingparolee Matthew R. Joseph as
a suspect in a March homicide.
RENO, Nev.
Man pleads guilty
to shooting golfer
who hit home
A Nevada man accused of
shooting a golfer who broke a
window at his home with an
errant ball has pleaded guilty to
a felony charge.
Jeff Fleming of Reno entered
the plea to battery with a deadly
weapon on Thursday in Washoe
County District Court. He faces
from probation to 10 years in
prison and a $10,000 fine when
he's sentenced Dec. 12.
The golfer was unable to find
his ball and was doing a drop
shot on the 16th hole of the Lak-
eridge Golf Course in September
2012 when Fleming approached
and fired a single shot at him
with a shotgun, prosecutors said.
The golfer was treated for minor
injuries to an arm and both legs
at a hospital.
ATLANTA
Ga. to review
tough death
penalty provision
The state that was the first
to pass a law prohibiting the
execution of mentally disabled
death row inmates is revisiting
a requirement for defendants to
prove the disability beyond a rea-
sonable doubt - the strictest bur-
den of proof in the nation.
A state House committee is
holding an out-of-session meet-
ing Thursday to seek input from
the public. Other states that
impose the death penalty have a
lower threshold for proving men-
tal disability, and some don't set
standards at all.
Just because lawmakers are
holding a meeting does not mean
changes to the law will be pro-
posed, and the review absolutely
is not a first step toward abolish-
ing Georgia's death penalty, said
State Rep. Rich Golick, R-Smyr-
na, chairman of the House Judi-
ciary Non-Civil Committee.
CAIRO
e Egypt police,
protesters clash at

Cairo university
Egyptian anti-riot police fired
tear gas Sunday at hundreds of
supporters of the country's oust-
ed Islamist president, besieging
them inside a prestigious Muslim
institution after stone-hurling
protesters cut off a main road.
Sunday's clashes marked the
second day of unrest at Al-Azhar
University, Sunni Islam's most
prominent center of learning.
Many supporters of ousted Presi-
dent Mohammed Morsi's Muslim
Brotherhood are students at Al-
Azhar, a stronghold of the group.
The campus is also near where
Islamists had set up a sprawling
protest camp that security forces
raided in August, leaving hun-
dreds dead and sparking days of
unrest.
* The students' protest started
with a march inside campus,
where protesters hurled stones
at the administrator's offices,
smashing windows and breaking
doors, said Ibrahim el-Houdhoud,
deputy head of the university. He
told satellite news channel Al-
Jazeera Mubashir Misr that he
warned protesters against leav-
ing campus and clashing with
security forces.

Performance
lauded in areas of
cost containment,
student support
By JENNIFER CALFAS and
SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporters
FLINT, Mich. - At the Octo-
ber Board of Regents meet-
ing on Friday, Regent Andrea
Fischer Newman (R) asked the
board to approve a $100,000
bonus for University President
Mary Sue Coleman.
After detailing Coleman's
performance during the pre-
vious year, Newman lauded
Coleman's leadership in areas
such as cost-containment,
controlling tuition costs, pro-

moting fundraising and stu-
dent support. The board voted
unanimously to approve the
one-time bonus, which will
come from non-general fund
sources.
Though today's vote was a
one-time bonus, Coleman has
historically donated pay raises
back to the University, often
in the form of student schol-
arships. Coleman donated her
additional compensation in
2007, 2011 and 2012. Though
Coleman did not announce
intentions to donate the bonus
at Friday's meeting, she men-
tioned she had not expected the
regents to discuss her compen-
sation.
The regents decision to
award Coleman's raise came
only two weeks after she and-
her husband gifted $1 million to
study abroad aid at her annual
leadership breakfast.

Hurricane Sandy's victims
plagued by insurance woes

Estimates fail to
cover expenses of
homeowners
NEW YORK (AP) - Many
homeowners who got slammed
by Superstorm Sandy are find-
ing their flood insurance checks
are nowhere near large enough
to cover their repairs, and con-
sumer advocates put some of the
blame on errors by the multitude
of adjusters who were hired in a
hurry after the disaster.
They say policyholders are
being shortchanged - sometimes
by tens of thousands of dollars -
because of adjusters' inexperience
and their overreliance on com-
puter programs, rather than con-
struction know-how, to estimate
rebuilding costs.
Those critics point to policy-
holders like John Lambert and
Lee Ann Newland, whose house
in Neptune, N.J., is still a moldy
wreck a year after Sandy filled it
with 41/2 feet of water.
If you buy drywall, flooring or
a new boiler in New Jersey, you
have to pay sales tax. But when
the insurance adjuster was using
computer software to calculate
the cost of repairing the home,
he neglected to click a box adding
taxesto the estimate, accordingto
a consultant hiredby the couple.
That cost the family $11,000,
and they say it wasn't the only
thing left out of their claim: The
adjuster failed to account for
phone jacks that needed to be
replaced, ceiling paint in one
room, pipes thatrustedbecause of
contact with salt water, baseboard
heating in places and other items.
"It was stupid things. Little
things. But it added up to be a
huge amount of money," Newland
said. She is trying to getthe insur-
ance company handlingher claim
to add $49,000 to her settlement.
"In our case, that is the difference
between us rebuilding, or not."
Another homeowner, Joanne
Harrington of Tuckerton Beach,
N.J., said her adjuster had her
down inaccurately as having
electric heat instead of forced
hot water. He said she had
ceramic tile, when she had more
expensive porcelain.
A similar pattern has been
repeated up and down the East
Coast as insurance companies
working with the federal gov-
ernment have processed nearly
144,000 claims filed with the
National Flood Insurance Pro-
gram after the storm.

Insurance companies dispute
that large numbers of custom-
ers are being paid less than what
they are owed. They say the
vast majority of adjusters do a
methodical, professional job, and
any oversights are easily correct-
ed if homeowners can produce
proof that a covered expense has
been overlooked.
"In a big event, you are going
to get some people entering
the industry ... and a percent-
age of those people are going to
do great, because they are good
people and they are smart, and
they want to do a good job," said
Jeff Moore, vice president of
claims for Wright Flood, which
handled more Sandy-related
flood cases than any other com-
pany. "And there will be another
percentage that don't do so well
... and those are the ones you get
to write about in the paper."
Computer technology, he
added, has made it easier than
ever for newcomers to write up a
claim properly, even ifthey know
nothing about construction or
insurance. "The software that
they use, it's very easy. I could
take you in a day and teach you to
write an estimate," Moore said.
Some consumer advocates
and homeowners don't see it that
way at all.
Immediately after the storm,
insurance comwpanies brought
in an army of adjusters from all
corners of the country. They
arrived with varying degrees of
expertise. All would have had to
have passed a certification test
in at least one state. Many were
veterans of past floods and hur-
ricanes, but not all.
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency, which
oversees the flood insurance
program, requires adjusters to
have four years' experience.
But newcomers with no track
record can start work after a
brief training period under cer-
tain circumstances, if they are
working for one of the major
insurance carriers that handle
the bulk of flood claims.
Amy Bach, executive direc-
tor of United Policyholders, an
advocacy group for insurance
consumers, said that for adjust-
ers with no background in con-
struction, there is a tendency to
rely too much on software like
Simsol, Xactimate and Sym-
bility to tell them how much a
repair job is going to cost.
"Some of these guys could
have been selling oranges last
week at a fruit stand, and this

week they are an insurance
adjuster," Bach said. "Instead
of using (the software) as a tool
to check the estimates pro-
duced by the contractors, they
use them as a last word,. But
computers don't rebuild and
repair homes. Contractors do."
Claims software is widely
used in . the industry after
major disasters and represents
a break with the old practice of
getting estimates directly from
contractors. It is designed to
take out the guesswork while
offering a check against con-
tractors who exaggerate the
cost of a job.
The programs supply
detailed prices, by ZIP code,
for carpets, cabinets, light fix-
tures and almost every other
part of a house, as well as the
labor costs for tasks as simple
as putting masking tape around
electrical outlets before paint-
ing a room.
Using those programs prop-
erly involves entering an inven-
tory of every piece of damage in
the house, and every possible
task that might be required to
put the building back into its
proper state. There are thou-
sands of variables. Miss a few,
and that means less money for
storm victims.
Simsol's president, John
Postava, said that like any
computer program, it is only
as good as the data people feed
into the system: "Garbage in,
garbage out."'
Simsol also operates an
adjusting firm and had 158
adjusters working in the
Northeast on Sandy claims.
Postava said he is confident
the great majority did a good
job.

Two workers killed
while performing
maintenance
OAKLAND, Calif.(AP) - Fed-
eral accident investigators were
in the San Francisco Bay Area
on Sunday to examine the deaths
of two transit workers who were
struck by an out-of-service com-
muter train performing routine
maintenance.
Saturday's accident on Bay
Area Rapid Transit tracks in the
East Bay city of Walnut Creek
took place against the backdrop
of a contentious and disruptive
labor strike.
Two National Transporta-
tion Safety Board investigators
were atthe site of the accident on
Sunday, NTSB spokesman Eric
Weiss said.
The two-man team led by Jim
Southworth, the board's railroad
accident investigator-in-charge,
willbe lookingateverythinglead-
ing up to the collision, from safety
procedures and qualifications of
personnelto the track's condition.
"We will be the lead agency in
the safety investigation into how
and why this happened," Weiss
said.
The four-car BART train with
several people aboard was being
run in automatic mode under
computer control at the time of
the accident, Assistant General
Manager Paul Oversier said. The
system has been shut down since
Friday because of a work stop-
page by the system's two largest
unions.
The train was returning from
a yard where workers cleaned
graffiti from unused cars when
it slammed into the two workers
- one a BART employee and the
other a contractor - who were
inspecting an above-ground
stretch of track between sta-
tions, Oversier said.
Neither BART nor the county
coroner has released the names
and ages of the victims. They
were the sixth and seventh
workers to die on the job in the
system's 41-year history.
Following the May death of
foreman who was killed by a
passenger train in West Haven,
Conn., the NTSB has been pro-
moting improved safety mea-
sures for track maintenance

crews, Weiss said.
In June, the board urged the
Metro-North Railroad to pro-
vide backup protection for crews
that were relying on dispatchers
to close tracks while they are
being worked on and to light the
appropriate signals.
The investigators now in
California will be checking to
see if BART uses "shunts" - a
device that crews can attach
to the rails in a work zone that
gives approaching trains a stop
signal - or any other of the
backup measures the NTSB rec-
ommended for the Metro-North
system, Weiss said.
"Obviously, we are very con-
cerned anytime anyone dies in
transportation accidents, but
we're very interested in the issue
of track worker deaths right
now," he said.
The fact that BART workers
have been on strike since Friday
would be part of the probe if it
turns out to be relevant in terms
of staffing and the experience
and training of the track workers
and train operators.
"We are not there because of
the strike, but they would look at
the circumstances and the per-
sonnel surrounding the issue,"
Weiss said.
Officials from the unions rep-
resenting BART's train opera-
tors and some of the system's
other workers have warned of
the danger that could come with
allowing managers to operate
trains as BART had planned to
do in case of a strike.
At a news conference Sat-
urday, Oversier would not say
whether a manager had been
at the controls. In an earlier
statement, BART said only
that the person was an experi-
enced operator. BART officials
said on Sunday that they could
no longer discuss the accident
because of the ongoing NTSB
investigation.
Meanwhile, with no indica-
tion that the striking BART
workers would be back on the job
Monday, the region was prepar-
ing for another day of gridlock:
on freeways and bridges clogged
with commuters who would
ordinarily be traveling by train.:
BART, the nation's fifth-largest-
commuter rail system, has an:
average weekday ridership of'
400,000.

Survey says...
Athletic Department should seek student input proactively
n Wednesday, the Central Student Government released a survey
of student responses to the general admission seating policy for
football. The survey contained appropriate and straightforward
questions such as, "were you supportive of the new seating policy at the
time of its announcement?" and "after 4 games, are you supportive of the
new policy?" The results seemed representative of the current campus
attitude about the changes, as the majority of responses are unfavorable.
While it's much appreciated that CSG is taking the initiative to communi-
cate the student body's opinions to the Athletic Department, the Athletic
Department is, once again, not doing very much to reach out to a substan-
tial part of their customer base - students.

Why investing in women helps all

the Swat Valley region of Pakistan,
where the Taliban come in and out

girls from school. In response to her
outspoken support for girls' edu-

After the government shutdown

thought it would be nice to write

are educated are vast and improve

education around the world is a

Girls and women around the

Michigan adopted first come, first served
seating this year, and many schools in the
country have similar systems. The Athletic
Department wanted the student section to
be full earlier on in the games, as students
previously have been able to show up late
in the past without losing their seats. While
thatgoal is understandable, the student body,
however, is less than happy with its applica-
tion. Upperclassmen in particular are feel-
ing shorted as they now have to stand in line
for long periods of time to get their desired
seats. Furthermore, season ticket prices
were raised from $205 to $295 - 23.08 per-
cent per home game.
The Athletic Department claims that
they'll be reviewing ticketing policies with
consideration of student feedback before the
2014 football season. But why was the survey
- which has prompted the dialogue - a proj-
ect of CSG? While CSG should act as a bridge
between students and the University, it isn't
necessarily their job to get feedback for the
Athletic Department.
With the basketball season approaching,
student discontent of the policy will only
transfer over to the new similar system for

basketball. Again, the Athletic Department
announced a change in student ticketing
policies long after students purchased tick-
ets; student input was barely present. Stu-
dents who paid for what they expected to be
the same game day experience they've had in
the past were cut short of just that. Basket-
ball tickets were oversold by 33 percent, forc-
ing students to show their "commitment" as
fans by coming to games in order to hold their
spots in the stands for future games. Again,
even if this change was made with an honest
goal of a higher-spirited game atmosphere,
students shouldn't have bought tickets under
false pretenses.
While the recent CSG survey gives us
insight to student ticketing preferences, sub-
sequent surveys may be most helpful before
athletic policies are set. Maybe students
should receive a survey now concerning their
opinions on the basketball ticketing system,
rather than halfway through the season, so
that feedback can be addressed before prob-
lems even occur. And maybe it should come
from the Athletic Department itself - the
ones who are actually responsible for the
changes.

SNAP should stay

On Sept. 19 the U.S. House of Representa-
tives approved legislation that will cut fund-
ing for the food stamp program and send
millions of Americans deeper into poverty.
The Nutrition Reform and Work Opportunity
Act proposes cuts of $39 billion over the next
10 years. The steep cuts will affect 47-million
Americans, and just under half of those are
children. Because of the high rates of pover-
ty, food insecurity and child hunger, serious
action needs to be taken to change the course
of this legislation.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program - commonly called food stamps -
is a federal aid program that supports low-
income individuals and families by providing
financial assistance for the purchase of food.
According to the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture, which runs the program, more than 15
percent of the country receives food assis-
tance with 83 percent of recipients consisting
of children, seniors and disabled individuals.
Currently, more than 80 percent of SNAP
households live in poverty. In Michigan,
one in six residents receives SNAP benefits
and will see the per-person-per-meal dollar
amount cut to $1.40.
The SNAP program has been beneficial
for many reasons. In the face of historically
high levels of unemployment during the
2008 recession, the program has been cred-
ited with keeping many people out of severe
levels of food insecurity and poverty. The
SNAP program lifted more than four-million
Americans above the poverty line in 2012. In
addition to direct effects, research has shown
that children who have early exposure to the
program have better outcomes metabolically,
economically and educationally.
Cutting billions of dollars of funding from
a major program appears to save money on
the surface, but there are many hidden con-
sequences. Giving participants less money to
spend results in slowing economic growth, as
a result of cutting consumption. In addition

to slow economic growth, experts believe
jobs will be affected. A study from the Uni-
versity of Massachusetts estimates that for
each $1-billion reduction, 13,718 jobs will be
eliminated. Lastly, projections show that as
the economy recovers, program spending will
decrease and, by 2019, will return to levels -
as a share of GDP - that it was at during 1995.
SNAP is necessary for our country, but I'm
not blind to its shortcomings. Currently, there
are no nutritional standards on the types of
food recipients are to purchase. Because the
amount per person is so low, many families
can only purchase cheap and unhealthy foods,
which ultimately can contribute to disease
and illness putting more strain on the system.
The Institute of Medicine and the National
Research Council released a report suggesting
ways in which the USDA should define adequa-
cy goals and ways to reach them.
Another issue commonly referred to
is fraud, such as when SNAP benefits are
exchanged for cash. Though it does exist,
there have been extensive efforts by the
USDA to control fraud, with statistics show-
ing one cent per dollar is trafficked. The
USDA investigates and disqualifies retail-
ers if they don't adhere to requirements. In
addition, many states are working in con-
junction with the USDA to implement anti-
fraud initiatives.
It's easy to look at and hear about a system
with a stereotype of abuse and dismiss the
latest cuts. But I challenge you' to research
the benefits of the SNAP program and the
millions of people it provides for. Influencing
Congress to protect SNAP is not only favor-
able for the poor, the elderly and the disabled,
but also for the rest of the people in this coun-
try who will benefit from a growing economy
and a failsafe should they ever find them-
selves in economic hardship.

One in three women will have an
abortion in her lifetime. For all of
the talk about abortion in U.S. poli-
tics, we never seem to talk about
the fact that abortion is a com-
mon experience among American
women. But we don't just talk about
abortion in America - we legislate
it; regulate it, define what it is and
isn't, and what it should and should
not mean. So, if abortion is so com-
mon in the United States, and we
are talking about it all of the time,
how come no one knows how preva-
lent it is?
As record numbers of legislation
regulating abortion procedures,
providers and facilities, conversa-
tions about abortion as a political
tool overshadow the fact that hav-
ing an abortion is a common and
personal experience, thus decon-
textualizing abortion from the cir-
cumstances that make it necessary.
When you hear about abortion,
you often hear about Texas, Ohio,
Kansas and the multitude of other
state legislatures that are regulat-
ing abortion care. Anti-abortion
legislation has flooded our federal
and state legislatures in record
numbers in the past several years.
According to the Guttmacher Insti-
tute, in 2011 alone, more than 92
anti-abortion laws were passed in
24 states. It often seems as if Con-
gress cares more about outlawing
abortion than it does balancing the
national budget or creating jobs.
The current conversation about
abortion in the United States
revolves around Rick Santorum
sound bites and fetal-pain theories.
The national conversations that
politicians are having about abor-
tion are very different from the
conversations we are -or too often,
aren't - having with our friends,,
our families and our communities.

For the past several years - and
ever since the legalization of abor-
tion in 1973 really - abortion hasn't
been about our experiences and the
role abortion plays in our everyday
lives; it has been about political ide-
ologies and re-election campaigns.
So, if you didn't know that one in
three women will have an abortion
in her lifetime, don't be surprised..
Our national rhetoric around abor-
tion access has nothing to do with
the stories of the individuals hav-
ing abortions and everything to do
with politicians who are committed
to legislating it.
Now, we're not pointing fingers,
and we're not placing blame. This
isn't about labels or "taking sides" on
the issue of abortion. Abortion and
our feelings about abortion don't fit
into two categories, and neither do
our experiences. The 1 in 3 Campaign
Week of Action revolves around
sharing abortion stories and work-
ing to change the conversation and
culture in the United States around
abortion. The policies our represen-
tatives are making, as well as the
media representation of this highly
politicized issue, fail to accurately
reflect our experiences.
One in three women will have an
abortion in her lifetime.
These are real peoples' lives.
These are women in our commu-
nity. One in three isn't just a sta-
tistic - it's a representation of all
the women in your life who have
had abortions but have not been
given the opportunity to talk about
it. Every time an anti-abortion law
is brought to the floor, every time
a group of anti-abortion activists
stands in front of a clinic entrance
with signs that shame individuals
who have abortions, we are failing
one-third of our nation's women.
We are effectively telling women

who have had abortions, and
women who are going to have abor-
tions - outlawing abortion doesn't
stop abortions from happening -
that their experience is shameful,
andthatthe choicetheymade about
their pregnancy is wrong. This is
the stigma, and whenwe stigmatize
abortion in this way, we are silenc-
ing a whole lot of people.
That's why, starting today, with
the 1 in 3 Campaign Week of Action,
we are changing the conversation.
The 1 in 3 Campaign is about letting
individuals who have had abortions
.tell their stories without-the shame
and stigma that currently surrounds
the abortion conversation. We are
reclaiming our voices, and telling
our stories so that woman around the
nation can tell theirs too. Not only do
we hope that the sharing of personal
abortion stories finally puts an end
to the stigmatization of abortion and
women who have abortions, but we
hope it mobilizes abortion support-
ers to advocate for safe, legal and
affordable abortion care.
This Thursday at 8 p.m. in the
Pendleton Room of the Michigan
Union, Students for Choice will be
holding its first annual 1 in 3 Abor-
tion Speak Out. The 1 in 3 Abortion
Speak Out is an opportunity for
individuals in the campus com-
munity who have had abortions to
share their experience in a safe,
empowering and supportive space.
Although everyone is welcome and
encouraged to join us, only individ-
uals who have had abortions will
have the opportunity to speak.
Now that you know one in three
women in, America will have an
abortion in her lifetime, it's time we
stop the shame and stigma.
Carly Manes is a
Public Policy junior.

ENDOWMENT
From Page 1A
increase from the previous year's
$270 million spending. However,
the vast majority of the endow-
ment cannot be used for general
fund and operational purposes
since most of it is restricted by
the donor's original intention for
their contribution.
The endowment earmarks
nearly 25 percent of its funds
for the University of Michigan
Health System and another 20
percent for student support and
financial aid. In a press release,
Slottow said the 20 percent
reserved for student aid has
reached $1.7 billion.
In terms of what is actually
withdrawn annually from the
endowment's total vaue, the Uni-
versity averages the value of the
endowment over the past seven
years then withdraws 4.5 percent
of the average for use each year -
allowing for more consistent cash
flews and protecting the principal
from market volatility. By basing
its spending on the average mar-
ket value instead of the current
market value, the University can
better stabilize distributions each
year - ensuring that programs

won't have a windfall one year
and nothing the next.
In an interview after the meet-
ing, Lundberg said the endow-
ment report reflects a changing
financial climate, as the nation
begins to inch out of the reces-
sion.
"Our changes tend to be grad-
ual, but right now they tend to
reflect that we've been recovering
from the financial crisis and that
the environment is normalizing,"
Lundberg said.
The University's endowment
portfolio also includes a small
program that invests in faculty
entrepreneurs called Michigan
Investment in New Technology.
The program was first introduced
by University President Mary Sue
Coleman in October 2011.
"There's been great reception
by the entrepreneurs and we're
very excited about the ability to
support our own businesses,"
Lundberg said. By July of this
year, the University had funded
seven startups.
Lundberg said the initiative
is in its early stages and the
investments will take time to
mature.
In a July interview, Rafael Cas-
tilla, the University's investment
risk management director, said

the University will likely hold on
to these investments for at least a
decade.
"We havegenerallyaverylong-
term horizon," he said. "We hope
there's going to be a return, but
we're in no rush to sell as soon as
possible.
In their conclusion to the
report, Lundberg and Slottow
wrote that the University's long-
term investment strategy is suffi-
cient for success in the future.
"Financial markets appear to
be normalizing with greater dis-
tance from the financial crisis
which should be rewarding for a
globally diversified investment
program," Slottow and Lundberg
wrote. "We remain confident in
our investment strategy and the
endowment's ability to continue
to provide support."
The last decline in the Uni-
versity's budget came in 2012,
with the endowment's total value
falling by 0.5 percent - mark-
ing the first time the endowment
decreased in value since 2009.
The 2009 downturn was caused
by the 2008 financial crisis and
.succeeding recession.

EVENT
From Page 1A
Regent Denise Ilitch (D-Bing-
ham Farms) and University alum
Steve Hutchinson, former offen-
sive guard for the Michigan foot-
ball team whose collegiate career
was followed by a 12-year stint in
the NFL.
Hutchinson and his wife
were called in to be the master
and mistress of ceremonies for
the event. An auction-style fun-
draiser at the end of the night
raised approximately $150,000
in support of breast cancer
research.
One highlight was remarks
from Flora Migyanka, a mother
of two and a survivor of breast
cancer who underwent exten-

sive treatment at the University
Hospital. With the example of
Migyanka's survival, physicians
present at the event stressed the
pervasiveness of the disease.
"You know what I think? I
think this is unacceptable," Ora
Pescovitz, executive vice presi-
dent for medical affairs and CEO
of UMHS, said in her remarks
aboutthe disease that kills nearly
40,000 women a year.
Several attendees, including
current medical students, said
their support was in concern
over a reduction in federal fund-
ing for research.
Sofia Merajver, scientific
director of the Breast Oncology
Program, said the reduction in
government funding for medical
research could be balanced out
by the recent increase in commu-

nity interest and philanthropic
involvement. To put it into per-
spective, Meraiver said $5,000
only funds about five days of
intensive research in a typical
laboratory.
The future of breast cancer
research lies in understand-
ing the genomic changes in the
tumors of every person rather
than complying with a one-
size-fits-all model of treatment,
Merajver explained.
"Cancer research is expen-
sive, but at the same time the
value that yoq get at a univer-
sity is huge because we are
doing research all the time,
and the money goes directly for
research," Merajver noted. "It's
a very efficient way to discover,
and our goal is to really discover
new knowledge."

big names."
The conference kicked off
with a presentation by Michigan
Athletic Director Dave Brandon
and other representatives from
the Athletic Department, who
outlined the University's plan to
construct 16 new athletic facili-
ties within the next five to seven
years.
The keynote conversation
between ESPN President John
Skipper and ESPN Commentator
Mike Trico discussed the evolv-
ing industry of sports coverage
and sports culture.
"There are a lot harder ways
to make a living that working in
sports. Almost all of them ... you
just kind of feel lucky," Skipper
said.
During Skipper's 14 years at
ESPN, he has been involved in
television, digital and print initia-
tives. He emphasized during his
speech the importance that alter-
native forms of media play in the
growing media industry.
In addition to the keynote con-
versation, there were breakout
sessions, networking opportuni-
ties and panel discussions held
throughout the day.
Tom Lewand, president of

the Detroit Lions football team,
participated in a panel discus-
sion regarding the importance of
cultivating a loyal fan base in the
growing sports world.
Lewand said in an interview
that a key factor for students
pursuing a business career in the
sports industry is to make sure
they don't limit themselves. He
said University students are com-
petitive because of a "high level
of intelligence" combined with a
"Midwest sensibility."
"Keep working at it," Lewand
said. "Look at all the different
ways that you could possibly get
engaged in any business that has
to do with the business of sports
- on the brand side, agency side,
the service side - there are just so
many different ways."
Ten non-University students
were honored through MSBC's
inaugural BIG Initiative - an
acronym for Build, Inspire, Grow
- which looks to honor students
from around the country who
excel in academics and athletic
endeavors.
This year, organizers put a
bigger focus on social media
and technology. MSBC was also
able to attract more high-profile
speakers and connect them to stu-
dents in a "one-on-one" environ-
ment, with plenty of networking
opportunities.

Many students in the Kinesi-
ology and Business school were
in attendance Friday. Kinesiol-
ogy graduate student Xiaochen
Zhou said she cameto the event to
learn from professionals and gain
knowledge of what the sports
business industry is like.
"Because we are international
students it gave us some insight
into the job market in America,
especially the American sport
industry," Zhou said. "It's very
different from what business is
like in China. I think it will be
very helpful."
The event was capped off with
a surprise Skype interview with
University alum Adam Schefter,
an NFL analyst for ESPN and
former sports writer at The
Michigan Daily. Students tweeted
questions to Schefter about his
days at the University and his
start in the sports industry.
"I don't have any skills - I
just work hard," Schefter said.
"Everyone that I deal with knows
that they can trust me."
MSBC will start planning next
year's conference in the com-
ing months. Business junior Alex
Lieberman, a MSBC commit-
tee member, said the committee
members are looking to expand
the conference nextyear and bring
in more representation from out-
side of the University community.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
The University released renderings for the expansion of the Earl V. Moore building on North Campus;

es. The project will cost $185 mil-
lion, with $100 million funded by
a donation from University alum
Charles Munger, vice chairman
of Berkshire Hathaway. The new
residence will be home to around
630 graduate students.
The regents also approved
construction of a new transpor-
tation research facility, spon-
sored by the University and
grants from the State of Michi-
gan's Department of Trans-
portation. Coleman lauded the
project and noted Stephen For-
rest, University vice president of
research, had lobbied the board
to approve the project.
Between the approval of
upcoming construction projects,
the regents also approved two
name changes on the athletic
campus in honor of University
donors. After donating $200 mil-
lion to the University's business

school and athletic department
last month, the regents voted to
rename much of South campus
as the Stephen M. Ross Athletic
Campus. The University will also
rename the renovated softball
facility after University alum
Donald R. Shepherd, who previ-
ously donated $25 million to the
University.
The board also approved plans
to relocate Reserve Officers'
Training Corps, or ROTC, opera-
tions from North Hall to the
Chemistry Building, Dow Labo-
ratory and Ruthven Museums.
The University will renovate
spaces within those buildings to
better house the program - at a
cost of $4 million.
Approximately 15,000 square
feet of renovated office space
will be transformed into physi-
cal fitness-rooms, administrative
function spaces and classrooms
in the Chemistry Building and
the Dow Laboratory. Approxi-
mately 6,000 square feet of the
Ruthven Museums will include

classrooms and storage spaces.
The project is slated for com-
pletion in fall 2014 and will be
designed by architectural firm
SmithGroupJJR - a contractor
frequently used by the Univer-
sity.
At the meeting, Tim Slottow,
executive vice president and
chief financial officer, said he
is ready to propose to demol-
ish North Hall. Although the
purpose of the space has yet to
be determined, Coleman said in '
an interview Monday the build-
ing will be part of a "larger con-
struction plan," which will be
rolled out during this academic
year.
North Hall was constructed
between 1899-1900 as a Home-
opathy Hospital but became an
extension of the main Univer-
sity Hospital after the regents
discontinued the independent
Homeopathic Medical School in
1922. It was turned over to the
Navy in 1940 and has been an
ROTC facility ever since.

Proppe said.
Engineering junior Jasleen
Randhawa, chair of the Commis-
sion on North Campus Life, said
she and many of her engineering
classmates have wanted Mujo to

run later into the night because of
significant time spent working at
the Dude.
"Being able to have a kind of
healthy option for food and not
having to order pizza out every
night is something that we felt
was really important," Randhawa
said.
Randhawa said Mujo's menu
should meet most of the demand

for better late-night food. How-
ever, other options, such as a fea-
tured entree from the cafe, are
also in the works.
"This is great for students
studying late on North Campus,"
said CSG Vice President Bobby
Dishell. "When students are
well-fed and well-hydrated, they
can study longer and be health-
ier."

U.S., Israel divided on
relationshin with Iran

U.S. considers
easing pressure as
Israel asks for more
JERUSALEM (AP) - Just
days after the first round of
global nuclear talks with Iran,
a rift appears to be emerging
between Israel and its closest
ally, the United States.
Israel's prime minister on
Sunday called on the U.S. to step
up the pressure on Iran, even
as American officials hinted at
the possibility of easing tough
economic pressure. Meanwhile,
a leading Israeli daily reported
the outlines of what could be
construed in the West as genu-
ine Iranian compromises in the
talks.
The differing approaches
could bode poorly for Israel as
the talks between six global
powers and Iran gain steam in
the coming 'months. Negotia-
tors were upbeat following last
week's talks, and the next round
of negotiations is set to begin
Nov. 7.
Convinced Iran is pursu-
ing nuclear weapons, Prime

__ 1

Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
believes the Iranians are try-
ing to trick the West into eas-
ing economic sanctions while
still pushing forward with their
nuclear program. Iran insists
its program is for peaceful pur-
poses.
"I think that in this situa-
tion as long as we do not see
actions instead of words, the
international pressure must
continue to be applied and
even increased," Netanyahu
told his Cabinet. "The greater
the pressure, the greater the
chance that there will be a
genuine dismantling of the
Iranian military nuclear pro-
gram."
Israel considers a nuclear-
armed Iran a threat to its very
survival, citing Iranian refer-
ences to Israel's destruction.
Netanyahu says pressure
must be maintained until Iran
halts all enrichment of ura-
nium, a key step in producing
a nuclear weapon; removes its
stockpile of enriched uranium
from the country; closes suspi-
cious enrichment facilities and
shutters a facility that could
produce plutonium, another

potential gateway to nuclear
arms.
Despite Netanyahu's warn-
ings, there are growing signs
that any international deal
with Iran will fall short of his
demands.
Over the weekend, U.S. offi-
cials said the White House
was debating whether to offer
Iran the chance to recoup bil-
lions of dollars in frozen assets
if it scales back its nuclear pro-
gram. The plan would stop short
of lifting sanctions, but could
nonetheless provide Iran some
relief.
In an interview broadcast
Sunday on NBC, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Jack Lew said it was
"premature" to talk of easing
sanctions. But he stopped short
of endorsing the tough Israeli
line and suggested the U.S.
would take a more incremental
approach in response to con-
crete Iranian gestures.
Asked whether he was wor-
ried the U.S. might ease the
sanctions prematurely, Netan-
yahu urged against a "partial
deal" with Iran. "I don't advise
doing that," he said on NBC's
"Meet the Press."

Knoxville explained how

because they have some won-

Considering the heaps of
praise for Jackson and the
amount of confidence Knox-

in general, there are certainly
high expectations for this film.
"I think I'm really excited for
everyone to see this film, and
I definitely think it's as good
as anything we've ever done,"
Knoxville said.
Knoxville will forever be
known as the king jackass. No
matter what he does from now
on, his legacy is set in stone. But
when you get a chance to speak
to him, you realize that Knox-
ville is more than that. He's a
genuine, kind guy - the kind of
guy that grows up to be a kick-
ass grandpa.
"Oh, I hope I'll be a much
better grandfather than Irving

When I heard "Rap God,"
the new Eminem single, what
hit me first was how very, well,
2000 the whole song sounded.
This is clearly intentional -
Eminem's new album is titled
The Marshall Mathers LP 2 in
reference to his 21 million-
selling 2000 album, but with so
many critics praising Eminem's
new music as a "return to form,"
I started thinking: "Why do we
want Eminem to keep doing
the same thing he was doing a
decade ago?"
Since his comeback from a
five-year hiatus in the middle
of last decade, Eminem's new
music has shown little sign of
growth or maturity. His tech-
nical rapping ability thankfully
remains intact, but his lyrics
unfortunately retain the same
shock value and ignorance that
has kept many of his old hits
from aging very well. The most

estrictions - has proven home," when he saw an adver-
ul. tisement for an animation


expo that was taking place in
Universal City, Calif. Every
single animation house in town
was going to be there looking
at portfolios. So Knott, who
taught himself how to draw by
tracing comic-book characters,
spent a few weeks sketching
people in cafes and animals
in the zoo and mimicking the
illustrations of famed animator
Preston Blair.
"It didn't take long to realize
that I had a really sub-standard
portfolio," Knott said. "Or at
least, very neophyte."
Once again, Knott's educa-
tion at the University proved
crucial in opening the door to
his future.
"The last table was Han-
na-Barbera," he said. "They
thought the same thing about
the sketches as everyone else,
but they saw this VHS tape
floating around in there. And
asked me, 'What's that?' I just
said, 'Oh, it's this one-minute
cartoon I did at U-M. It's this
kind of coyote-roadrunner
type cartoon.'"
After watching his student
film, the Hanna-Barbera repre-
sentative informed Knott that
they were looking for someone
to hire and train as an animatic
editor, which is somebody who
cuts together storyboards into
a timed-out version of what the
cartoon would look like.
"I said, 'Sign me up!' I came
in for an interview, and that's
how I got in."
Since that pivotal moment,
Knott worked his way up from a
successful start as a storyboard
artist at Disney Television Ani-
mation to an Emmy-winning
director at Nickelodeon studios
for "The Penguins of Madagas-
car."
"Storyboarding is basically
directing because you're choos-
ing all the shots," Knott said.
"Not only that, you're doing
the acting, because you have to
draw the acting out of the dia-
logue. I wanted to be a director,
but I didn't think I had much of
a shot. But, here it is in front
of me, and all I have to do is be
able to draw everything."
Currently, Knott is working
as a storyboard artist on the
feature film "Legend of the
NeverBeast" for Disneytoon
Studios, which is set to release
in spring 2015.

or two. Films
depicting liv- AtQualityl6

figures are the

this latest one
falls short of
giving its characters the story
they deserve.
"The Fifth Estate" is based on
books written by ex-Wikileaks
members Daniel Domscheit-
Berg, David Leigh and Luke
Harding. It focuses on the
dynamics between Wikileaks
founder Julian Assange (Bene-
dict Cumberbatch, "Star Trek
Into Darkness") and Daniel
Berg (Daniel Briihl, "Rush"), his
original right-hand man.- The
two embark on an odyssey to
change the world by revealing
its secrets, and at first, all goes
well as the film adeptly shows
how furiously typing at. key-
boards in the dark will topple
banks, parliaments and compa-
nies. Trouble enters the picture
when Assange and Berg go head
to head over whether to redadt
information from their largest
leak of all, the release of State
Department cables.
Though the film is officially
marketed as a sort of political
thriller, it can't seem to find
its identity. "The Fifth Estate"
tries to touch upon too many
points in its attempt to capture
the gravity of the situation.
Aling with the main arc depict-
ing drama between Assange
and Berg, there are side plots
between Berg and his girlfriend
(Alicia Vikander, "Anna Kar-
enina"), between Assange and
editors of major newspapers,
and between government offi-
cial Sarah Shaw (Laura Linney,
"Hyde Park On Hudson") and
her Middle Eastern "not-just-
an-informant." The last con-
flict appears out of nowhere in
the film, completely irrelevant
to the overall storyline. The
end result is a confused movie
spread thin as it flits among
too many characters.

Revaluing shock value of nudity in art

By GILLIAN JAKAB
For the Daily
Walking through the library
halls to the Duderstadt Video
M Center on North Campus, we
were warned by signs that there
would be "nudity" in the eve-
ning's performance. I got into my
nudity-viewing mindset, which
usually involves putting on my
"this-is-totally-normal" face.
"Masturbation and sex and de-
robing - why's it always mastur-
bation and sex and de-robing when
people hear queer? Well, it is fun,"
Thomas DeFrantz, the director
of SLIPPAGE, an interdisciplin-
ary research and performance
collective, would protest jokingly
throughout the performance as he
stripped down to his underwear
once again.
He was upstaged by his fellow
male dancer, who did not stop at
his underwear, and proceeded to
waghiships inaproudmotionbar-
ing all he had to show. "Theoryog-
raphy 4.5: We queer (still) here" is
a multi-media dance performance
studded with these periods of
dialogue, proclamation and reac-
tion, in which the dancers read
audience contributions ("write
something that's queer" we were
prompted) from index cards, and
express them through movement
and adlib.

New'Carrie'knockoff
diminishes King classic

"Can you hear me now?"
Bell sweetens the
niche-corn 'World'

For the Daily
Far too similar to Brian De
Palma's 1976 version of "Carrie,"
the newest iteration adds noth-

modern horror

ting utterly fail
to distract from Sony
the film's emo-
tional flatness, making this most
recent adaptation of the Stephen
King novel feel wholly unneeded.
King's original story of titular
character Carrie White, (Chloe
Grace Moretz, "Hugo"), represents
a wicked twist on the typical high-
school prom narrative. Socially
handicapped by the religious
fanaticism of her mother (Julianne
Moore, "Crazy, Stupid, Love."),
Carrie suffers from the cruel teas-
ing of her fellowseniors.
Carrie does receive some sup-
port, however, from her gym
teacher, Ms. Desjardin (Judy
Greer, "The Descendants"). With
her help and the kindness of some
of Carrie's fellow students, Carrie
manages to overcome her social
fears and get a date to the prom.
Just when her night is going per-
fectly, a sadistic prank humiliates
Carrie. Pushed past her breaking
point, Carrie takes revenge against
her tormentors using her recently
discovered telekinetic powers.
Unfortunately, not only does
Moretz look far from the part of a
social outcast, but her acting falls
far short of Sissy Spacek's (the 1976
"Carrie") Academy Award-nomi-
nated performance for the original
film. Moretz's grimaces inspire
more humor than horror. For her
part, Julianne Moore creates an
appropriately disturbing portrait
of the mother, but her treatment
of Carrie appears more ineffectual
than horrifying.
Not bold enough to stray far
from the original's formula,
"Carrie" seems a mere cosmetic
upgrade of the original with noth-

cuts a sympathetic vignette of
what it means to make a voice

This film inhabits a spe-
cial place in Hollywood meta
because it confronts and trea-
ties with the bullshit that con-
stitutes movie culture. To make
a movie about some aspect of
the movie-making industry
isn't a novel thing, but in mov-
ie-movies you rarely see Bell's
level of attention to the idiotic
human sillinesses or painful
egotistical pitfalls thatpmake
us secretly loathe ourselves.
Thanks to Lake, Martin and
Corddry, though, the bullshit
doesn't win out.

Imagine walking down the
street in New York City and
being drawn in by a street ven-
dor with a small selection of
spray-paint art for only $60
each. The canvases range in
sizes but one or two catch your
eye, so you purchase them and
then continue on your way.
Now imagine that those two
small pieces of artwork you
spent $120 on are actually worth
tens of thousands of dollars in
the right market. This happened
to three very lucky individuals
when celebrated and reclusive
graffiti artist Banksy recently
decided to open up a stall near
Central Park during his month-
long exhibition in New York.
But don't get your hopes up
for another such event any time
soon. According to his website,
the stunt was a one-time thing.
Luckily, though, Banksy will
still be creating new pieces all
over the city for a little bit lon-
ger.
Banksy is a British graffiti
artist whose popularity has been
growing over the last decade or
so. No one really knows what he
looks like (though many claim
to have pictures of him), and his
pieces involve intricate stencils
that have been spray-painted
onto a variety of different medi-
ums, from sidewalks to the backs
of trucks. A lot of Banksy's piec-
es also act as a form of creative
social and political commentary
and display a deep hatred for
capitalism, war and an accep-
tance of "the establishment."
But not all of Banksy's work
is so socially conscious. A quick
Google search will yield dozens
of tongue-in-cheek pieces that
are likely to bringa smile to your
face. A lot of Banksy's pieces use
graffiti that someone else has
already put on a wall or some

Daily Sports Editor,
1. The secondary has signifi-
cant holes.
For six weeks, Michigan's
defense had bailed it out time
and again. It made a goal-line
stand against Akron, stifled
Connecticut despite turnovers
and stopped Minnesota.
The defense was successful
largely because the second-
ary prevented big plays, even,
if it did so by playing loose
and allowing easy under-
neath routes. But that fell
apart against Penn State in the
fourth quarter, when the Nit-
tany Lions went 80 yards in
less than 30 seconds to tie the

game.
That was nothing compared
to this week against Indiana.
The Hoosiers passed for 410
yards on 43 passes, an average
of 9.5 per attempt. The second-
ary was torched for four touch-
downs.
The defense was caught out
of position, but other times,
the secondary simply got out-
played. On Indiana's first and
second passing touchdowns,
the Hoosiers' quick tempo
led to breakdowns in the
secondary. And on the final
passing touchdown, redshirt
sophomore Blake Countess lost
his man on the goal line, lead-
ing toan easy score.
Indiana's longest play of the
game, though, came when the

secondary was in the correct
alignment. Freshman corner-
back Channing Stribling had
positioning on Indiana receiv-
er Kofi Hughes, but Hughes
jumped over Stribling to steal
the ball away. Poor tackling
after the catch allowed the
67-yard touchdown. Earlier,
junior . cornerback Raymon
Taylor dropped an easy pick
six.
The game was Michigan's
worst defensive performance
of the year - and possibly of
defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison's tenure. Through
seven games, the Wolverines
have defended more passes
than allibut 11 FBS teams. More
than halfway through the sea-

and four touchdowns, almost
doubling his season touchdown

But put into a larger context,
one where the defense gave up

The week before Penn State,
Michigan fit into the Big Ten
picture with a defense that
allowed just one touchdown to
Minnesota, ateam that later
beat Northwestern on the road.
That win sent Northwestern - a
team that was seen as one of the
favorites to win the Legends
Division before the year - to 0-3
in the Big Ten.
Against Indiana, the defense
was far from that. It finished
the game by doing its job -
fifth-year senior safety Thomas
Gordon's second interception of
the game sealed the win - but
almost every defensive back in
the Michigan secondary was
beaten deep. Forty-seven points,
even against a good offense, isn't
going to cut it against the meat
of Michigan's schedule over the
next five games.
If the Wolverines win out, the
division is theirs. The odds of
that, though, with a team this
inconsistent and confusing, are
slim to none.
Michigan doesn't have anoth-
er game on the schedule where
one side of the ball can dominate
and the other side can be domi-
nated and still win, no matter
how middling the Big Ten is this
year.
After the game, Hoke was
asked what the identity of his
team is. A power running team
that gained 503 yards through
the air, mostly out of a shotgun
formation? A hit-'em-in-the-
mouth defense that gave up 572
yards to Indiana?
He paused for several sec-
onds, shook his head and smiled.
"That's a great question," he
said. "So good that I don't know
if I can answer that."

Dazzling goals on display

Offense delivers in OT

By MINH DOAN
For the Daily
In the second half of Sunday
afternoon's matchup between
Wisconsin (1-2 Big Ten, 9-3-1 over-
all) and the Michigan men's soc-
cer team, freshman defender Lars
Eckenrode was hustling to recov-
er from an

get the ball.
A Badgers attacker came in a sec-
ond later and cleated him in the
face.
The physical battle between
the two teams ended in a 2-1 vic-
tory for the Wolverines on a goal
by redshirt junior midfielder Tyler
Arnone with under four minutes
left in regulation. Michigan (2-2,
6-4-3) was coming off an emotion-
al win over No. 6 Creighton but
showed no signs of slowing down
against Wisconsin.
Arnone's game-winning goal
highlighted a second half of fan-
tastic goals. In the 87th minute,
after a defensive gaffe by the Bad-
gers, Arnone collected the ball
outside the 18-yard box from red-
shirt sophomore Colin McAtee
and unleashed a vicious side volley
past sprawling Wisconsin goalie
Casey Beyers into the left side of
the goal.
"I took (the ball) off my chest
and it sat nicely for me, and I just
focused on technique," Arnone
said. "I didn't try to hit the ball
with a lot of power. It was prob-
ably one of the best goals I've
scored in my life."
During the 53rd minute, a
defensive mistake by the Badgers
that led to a Wolverine goal. Soph-
omore forward James Murphy
applied pressure to Wisconsin's
back line and stole the ball from a
defender. After taking two touch-
es to goal and with Beyers racing
out to cut off the angle, Murphy
chipped the ball over Beyers into
the right side netting for a goal
- his team-leading fourth of the
year - to put Michigan on the
board first.
"I thought James Murphy
was outstanding," said Michigan
coach Chaka Daley. "He scored a
great goal."

Rachael Mack setthe Michigan
record for most career goals. As
the over-
time game OHIO STATE 1
winner. MICHIGAN 2
Against
Ohio State.
As a Michigan field hockey player,
you can't ask for much more.
In a hard-fought overtime
game, the 19th-ranked Wolver-
ines field hockey team (2-2 Big
Ten, 9-6 overall) pulled off a 2-1
victory over Ohio State in Colum-
bus.
In addition to adding a confer-
ence win to their record Sunday
afternoon, the Wolverines cel-
ebrated the enormous success of
senior forward Rachael Mack,
who netted both goals for Michi-
gan and secured her place as the
Wolverines' all-time leading goal
scorer.
The offensive star recorded
her 69th career goal in the sixth
minute of sudden-death overtime
play. Mack hit the right side of
the net after receiving a long pass
from redshirt junior midfielder
Lauren Hauge, dodging a defend-
er and ripping a shotfrom an open
area at the top of the circle.
Michigan came out strong in
overtime, starting off the scor-
ing opportunities with an early
penalty corner followed by a high
shot by redshirtjunior back Leslie
Smith. The Wolverines secured
the win with Mack's record-
breaking goal.
"It feels phenomenal," Mack
said. "It's something I've been
working towards since my fresh-
man year, so to actually achieve

Defenders succeeded in mark-
ing their opponents and staying
in front of the Buckeyes near the
net.
Despite its control of the sec-
ond half, Michigan couldn't capi-
talize on any of its shots or corner
opportunities and the game went
into overtime.
The Wolverines came into the
game aware that a win would
not come easily against this par-
ticular Ohio State team. Although
Michigan led the all-time series,
which now stands at 33-26-2,
coming into Sunday's game, it has
dropped four out of its last five
meetings in Columbus.
Coaches and players alike also
knew that both teams would
bring their best play even before
the game began-a product of the
rivalry between the two schools.
Green and yellow cards against
both teams as well as a tiring back
and forth battle that left the Wol-
verines relying on fresh legs off
the bench highlighted the inten-
sity of the game.
"It was a big team win where
a lot of players got to contrib-
ute," Pankratz said. "We're very
well conditioned and to be able
to rotate like that kept our tempo
really high."
When a game enters overtime,
the team mentality must change.
Each player must be more aggres-
sive, more urgent, in every fight
for possession. In the end, it was
passion and the desire to win that
put Michigan on top of Ohio State.
"It's a battle of heart, essen-
tially," said redshirt senior goal-
keeper Haley Jones. "That's what
really comes in, who's more pas-
sionate about the win, who really
wants it."

Senior forward Rachel Mack scored her 69th career goal to set the new Michigan career scoring record.

it today is the best feeling in the
world."
The Wolverines got off to a
rocky start when they gave up the
first goal of the game less than
13 minutes in. Ohio State main-
tained its one-goal lead for most
of the first half, seeing little pres-
sure from the Michigan offense in
that time. A deflection into the net
by Mack off a pass from redshirt
junior midfielder Sammy Gray
with just 32 seconds remaining in

the half finally gave the Wolver-
ines the momentum they needed.
"It was great timing because
we got it right at the end of the
first half," Mack said. "Being able
to tie it up was very motivating,
and it helped with the confidence
of the team going into the second
half."
In the second half, Michi-
gan came out with a newfound
intensity and sense of urgency.
The offense awakened, record-

ing 14 shots in the second half as
opposed to just three in the first.
"We refocused on what the
game plan was and the players
really executed that in the second
half," said Michigan coach Mar-
cia Pankratz. "They came out on
fire and really motivated to play at
their best."
The Wolverines also played a
solid game on defense, allowing
just five shots through both the.
regulation and overtime periods.


SPREAD
From Page 1B
had the best game of his career,
finishing with 151 yards rushing
and four touchdowns.
Those numbers are hard to put
up in a video game, much less in
real life.
"Obviously our defense has
played way more consistent than
our offense has all year," said All-
American fifth-year senior left
tackle Taylor Lewan. "It was nice
to have their back on this one."
The first drive of the game was
one of the few drives that wasn't
finished by Michigan for a touch-
down, but it showed that Borges
had a creative game plan from the
start. The offensive coordinator

had been criticized in the media
for his propensity to run the ball
on first down. On Saturday, the
first play of the game was a deep
pass to Gallon that fell incom-
plete. The next play, Gallon got a
handoff on an end-around, and
after a delay-of-game penalty,
Gardner had an 11-yard scramble
on third down. Michigan had to
punt, but the point was made.
All game long, Borges seemed
determined to break the offensive
mold put into place after Penn
State. More than two-thirds of
the Wolverines' plays came out
of the shotgun. Gardner executed
multiple rollout passes, and Borg-
es called plenty of read-option
runs.
It wasn't what Michigan ini-
tially envisioned before the sea-

son, which was a power running
game, but it worked.'
"I'm more of a fan of the down-
hill run game, but whatever gets
Fitz yards gets Fitz yards," Lewan
said.
Added Gardner: "I could have
never dreamed about playing a
game like this after such a tough
loss. I feel like it's all about the
offensive line. They gave me plen-
ty of time."
That offensive line saw two
new starters at guard on Saturday,
redshirt junior Joey Burzynski
and redshirt freshman Erik Mag-
nuson. Burzynski was injured in
the first half, so in stepped true
freshman Kyle Bosch,
The regular starter, redshirt
freshman Kyle Kalis, still got
some playing time, but for all

intents and purposes, the new
guys played well, even if it was the
first game of Bosch's career.
"Bosch played well," Lewan
said. "My first Big Ten game as a
freshman, I just remember look-
ing around and saying, 'Oh my
God, this is the Big Ten.' I think
Bosch did a great job. The first
couple plays he was a little star-
ry eyed, but he knows what his
strengths and weaknesses are
and so do I so I tried to help him
out as much as I could."
To be fair, some of Michigan's
offensive explosion needs to
be credited to Indiana's porous
defense, which often left Gallon
open even after he had eclipsed
the 200-yard receiving mark.
Declarative statements can't be
made against defenses that bad.

But if Borges and the Wol-
verines stick to the offensive
look they didn't originally want
to employ, whatever offense
struggles that occurred earlier
in the season might head to the
backburner. It's different, but it's
working, and that's what should
matter.
"We;kind of put (the spread) in
for Indiana," Lewan said. "We'll
see what we do in the future. I
know we'll still do stuff like run-
ning downhill because that's the
type of team we want to be and
we have the guys up there to do it,
it's just doing it consistently. But
if (the spread) works, we aren't
just going to throw it to the side.
Coach Borges is a smart guy and
our coaches know what they are
doing."

son, that's not a fluke - that's the
opponents looking to take advan-
tage of a vulnerability.
2. Tempo can burn the Michigan
defense.
During the week, Hoke said he
wouldn't plan anything different
in practice to adjust for Indiana's
up-tempo offense. Michigan's
practices, he said, are naturally
speedy. That would be prepara-
tion enough.
The Hoosiers, though, caused
confusion by hurrying to the
line. On multiple occasions, they
scored touchdowns as the defense
struggled to communicate.
On Indiana's second posses-
sion, it took just 10 seconds from
a first-down play to the next
snap. Taylor, Hoke said, was try-
ing to get the call from fifth-year
senior safety Thomas Gordon.
Meanwhile, wide receiver Cody
Latimer streaked past Taylor. The
safety help Taylor believed would
be there never came. The play
went for 59 yards and a touch-
down.
Later, after Taylor dropped the
interception, Indiana hurried to
the line. Again, an Indiana receiv-
er was able to get over the top of
the secondary for a touchdown.
Up-tempo offenses also caused

issues on the defensive line. Mat-
tison likes to rotate linemen con-
stantly. That's difficult when the
offense runs the hurry-up.
If there is one other team in the
Big Ten capable of cycling plays
as fast as Indiana, it'sOhio State.
Michigan will have to be more
prepared for it in The Game.
3. Borges has shown a willingness
to commit to the spread.
In an ideal world for Michigan
coach Brady Hoke and offensive
coordinator Al Borges, the Wol-
verines' offense would likely look
much different from the one that
put up 63 points on Indiana Sat-
urday. Not that anyone is arguing
with the results.
Hoke and Borges came to Ann
Arbor with the promise of a tradi-
tional power running game. Some
pictured the three-yards-and-a-
cloud-of-dust offenses of the Big
Ten's past, but Borges has always
shown more nuance than that.
Still, big, road-grading linemen
would abound. The inside run-
ning game would flourish.
Well, the inside running game
hasn't flourished. The road-grad-
ing linemen, at least on the inte-
rior, haven't flattened much of
anything. So against on Indiana,
Borges committed to the spread,
and the offense exploded for 751
yards of total offense. Finally, the
running game broke out. Fifth-
year senior running back Fitzger-

ald Toussaint ran for151yards, his
highest total in his last 20 games.
Now, Michigan must decide
what kind of team it wants to be.
Hoke said the opposing defense
dictates how much spread Borges
will use. Indiana, they felt, was
more vulnerable to the spread.
Michigan has had more suc-
cess in those formations. But
the vision for the program is the
downhill, under-center running
game.
"That's what we want to do,"
said fifth-year senior left tackle
Taylor Lewan. "That's the kind of
team we want to be."
But in year three under Hoke,
Michigan isstillin limbo, a down-
hill running team without all the
parts necessary to run downhill.
As it becomes increasingly clear
that's not the best option, will
they fully commit? And then
what, exactly, is the identity of
Team 134?
"That's a great question," Hoke
said. "And so good that I don't
know if I can answer that."
4. Defenses can contain Jeremy
Gallon or Devin Funchess. But not
both.
By the second half, when fifth-
year senior receiver Jeremy Gal-
lon already had 170 yards, it was
inconceivable that he had not
drawn a double team. He explod-
ed for 50 more yards, to move
his total to 220. Then another 70

yards made it 290. Then 53 yards
on the next drive for 343.
Still, Gallon remained in single
coverage.
His 369 total yards was an
unprecedented individual accom-
plishment in Big Ten play. But
Gallon also has sophomore tight
end Devin Funchess to thank.
By now, Funchess is a tight end
in name only. Most of the game,
he was split out wide on the same
side as Gallon. The formation cre-
ates a dilemma for defenses.
Leave Funchess in single cov-
erage, and he can beat smaller
cornerbacks with his size. Yet
leavingGallon one-on-one proved
worse for Indiana.
In Funchess's first two games
split out wide, defenses still
keyed on Gallon, and they most-
ly kept him in check. In two
games against Minnesota and
Penn State, Gallon totaled nine
receptions for 134 yards and one
touchdown. Comparatively, that's
pedestrian. Funchess, mean-
while, had 11 receptions for 263
yards and 3 scores.
Indiana decided to give more
attention to Funchess. It did limit
his production, and he finished
with four receptions for 84 yards.
But Gallon made the Hoosiers pay
over and over again.
Remember, also, that redshirt
junior quarterback Devin Gard-
ner's rebound after a bad string of
turnovers coincided with Funch-
ess's move to receiver. Gardner

has taken better care of the ball.
But having another weapon didn't
hurt.
"It's hard to combination two
of them," Hoke said. "And if you
do, then the other guy on the
other side is by himself. I think
there's no doubt that having
Devin Funchess out there in the
open space helps."
5. Bold Prediction: The Legends
Division winner will have two
losses, but there will be no out-
right division champion.
Northwestern looked most
promising to start conference
play, but the Wildcats lost their
first three Big Ten games. Write
them off, but don't be surprised
if they play spoiler in the Legends
Division.
Michigan also has a confer-
ence loss, and winning out is atall
task. Nebraska is unblemished
in the conference but still must
play Northwestern, Michigan
State and Iowa and at Michigan
and Penn State. Winning three of
those five games isn't too shabby.
Michigan State looks to be in
the driver's seat, with the best
shot to finish with less than two
losses. But the Spartans still have
issues on offense, plus games
against Michigan, Nebraska and
Northwestern. Can they win two
of those three? Maybe. But in the
weak Big Ten this year, don't bank
on it.


MICHIGAN

criticizes anything too harshly
- perhaps summed it up best,
when asked about his reaction to
the defensive performance and
such a high-scoring game.
"A lot of frustration," he said.

"Sick feeling."
Fifth-year senior safety
Thomas Gordon said that the
Hoosiers' fast tempo caught the
Wolverines off guard, though it
certainly came as no surprise -
they'd been preparing for it all
week.
But if the Michigan defense
struggled this much on Saturday

against a team that hasn't beaten
the Wolverines since 1987, then
what are they goingto look like
when November rolls around
and it faces the meaty part of its
schedule?
That's not to take away from
Gardner and Gallon's accom-
plishments. But that kind of
performance is not realistically

sustainable - they aren't still
going to be smashing the same
kind of records when Ohio State
rolls into town.
And then, what will the
Wolverines have to cover up its
miscues?
Hoke will dream about it,
though.
"I'd like to see the same

offense show up," Hoke said
about the Wolverines' next con-
test, in East Lansing after the
bye.
Then he paused.
"Maybe a different defense."

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer
There stood senior forward
Nkem Ezurike, three feet in
front of the goal she's hit so many
times, looking for another break.
She finally caught one, when the
ball fell right on her foot.
Ezurike cashed in and set
Michigan's all-time scoring
record with 45 career goals,
leading the Wolverines to a pair
of weekend_
wins that PUtoUt 1
kept them MICHIGAN 3
in conten-
tion for the Big Ten title.
Michigan rallied past Indiana
on Friday, 1-0, and Purdue on
Sunday, 3-1.
After weeks of developing a
supporting cast around Ezurike,
Michigan (6-1-1 Big Ten, 12-2-s
overall) went back to an offense
that ran right through its star.
The senior finished with 18
shots in two games, and although
just four were on goal, she hit the
back of the net on three.
"It took us a little bit to get
untracked, but I was pleased
throughout the match that when
we went to goal we were creat-
ing really good chances," said
Michigan coach Greg Ryan. "I'm
always happy with three goals,
but I wouldn't have been sur-
prised to see more goals today
because wemenstbusiness."
Purdue took the lead in the
24th minute on a long shot, put-
ting the Wolverines in an early
hole. Ezurike had an answer 11
minutes later - her record-tying
gosi came on a penalty kick.
The Wolverines allowed just
three shots on goal and had lit-
tle trouble holding the one-goal
lead.
.Michigan remained tied into
the second half until Ezurike
slammed home the rebound of
sophomore forward Corinne
Harris's shot.
Senior midfielder Christina
Ordonez tacked on an insurance
goal in the 69th minute.
Purdue (3-5, 8-7-1) came in

0.

EIisKIRKLAND/Daily
Seniar farward Nkem Ezarike now has 45 caress goals, a new program record.

as the worst defensive team in
the Big Ten, giving up 34 goals
in 15 games. Michigan suffered
its fourth straight scoreless first
half.
"They do a good job of putting
on pressure," Ezurike said. "You
have to take them one on one to
get your chances. It's just focus-
ing to get your chances and take
that step away from them to get
that shot."
With the exception of the one-
goal deficit, Friday's game looked
similar to Sunday's. Michigan
struggled to put away its chanc-
es until Ezurike's second-half
breakthrough.
Harris passed a ball right
down the middle to Ezurike in
the box for the finish, and the
Wolverines held on for the final
15 minutes.
"Indiana's a good team -
it's going to be tough to get our
chances against them," Ezurike
said. "I think we just kept play-
ing our game, getting the ball
wide and getting inside."
As with many Big Ten teams,

Indiana (4-4, 11-4-1) played
physically with Ezurike, draw-
ing some frustration from the
forward and Ryan.
"It's part of the game. I try not
to let it frustrate men" Ezurike
said. "But it is what it is."
Ezurike continues to play
through the contact as oppo-
nents continue to cry to stop her.
She scored twice against Indiana
last year in a 3-0 victory.
"We just tried to stay com-
pact and not let her turn, make
sure we stayed an arm's length
away," said Indiana coach Amy0
Berbary. "I thought we fought
hard, I thought we tackled hard
and that's something we've been
working hard to be better at."
The quest for the record is
over for Ezurike, but Ryan said it
won't make much of a difference.
"It wasn't a distraction. I
never cared," Ryan said. "For me,
these things just happen because
a player's a good player, and she
continues to go hard. I knew she
was goingcto get it, never thought
about it twice."
