ADMINISTRATION
New chief
of UMPD
picked after
long search

Former lieutenant
Robert Neumann
has been with the
police since 1985
By WILL GREENBERG
and SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editors
Robert Neumann, previously a
University Police lieutenant, has
been selected as the University
of Michigan Police Department's
next chief. The appointment is
effective immediately.
According to a Tuesday press
release, Neumann was chosen
from a pool of more than 150
applicants. He has served with
the UMPD since 1985 and was one
of the original six officers to first
be sworn into the force in 1990.
He became a lieutenant in 1999.
Neumann graduated from the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
National Academy as well as East-
ern Michigan University's School
of Police Staff and Command. He
is also a Civil Air patrol captain
serving as personnel officer and
professional development officer

with the Willow Run Composite
Squadron and serves on the Ann
Arbor Transportation Authority
Accident Review Board.
"I am humbled and honored
to accept this opportunity," Neu-
mann said in a statement. "Hav-
ing worked in the department
since before it became a sworn
police agency, I've participated
in an incredible transformation
of safety and security services'at
the University. This is a wonder-
ful community in which to work."
In a statement, Eddie Wash-
ington Jr., executive director of
the Division of Public Safety and
Security, lauded Neumann's con-
tributions to the UMPD.
"Bob's years of successful
experience in working with many
campus leaders, students and
other law enforcement agencies
as well as managing several units
within the UMPD, contributed to
his strong candidacy for this posi-
tion," Washington said. "I admire
that Bob consistently provides
proven integrity and fairness to
every situation."

Protesters gather on the Diag Tuesday to raise awareness for the recent outbreak of violence against peaceful demonstrations this past week in Venezuela
Protest exhibits solidarity

Over 100 gather
to support anti-
government efforts
in Venezuela
ByALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
While scores of Venezuelans
have taken to the streets of
Caracas amid anti-government
protests, more than 100 people
gathered on the Diag Tuesday
to show their solidarity with
the movement.
Last week, three people were
,killed when Vene7uelan secu-
rity forces used tear gas and
weapons to break up the street
demonstrations in opposition

to former Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez's socialist succes-
sor, President Nicolas Maduro.
On Tuesday, security forces
arrested opposition leader Leo-
poldo Lopez. The 42-year-old
economist and Harvard Univer-
sity graduate surrendered him-
self to soldiers after delivering
a heartfelt speech that inspired
numerous demonstrations.
In response to the unrest in
Venezuela, two University stu-
dents created "SOS Venezuela,"
a Facebook event posted less
than 24 hours in advance of the
Diag rally. The event aimed to
raise awareness of the govern-
ment's violent intervention in
response to the mostly peaceful
student-led protests.
LSA sophomore Fabiana
Diaz and Engineering fresh-

man Fernando Mezquita, the
event's creators, said they felt
they needed to bring attention
to these protests since the Ven-
ezuelan government's Internet
service provider has intermit-
tently blocked the spread of
information on Twitter and
Facebook.
"With all that's been going
on, we've been watching the
news and we've been watching
the web with everything that's
been posted and we really feel
a sense of patriotism, to say the
least, that we have to do what
we can to help the situation,"
Mezquita said.
Born and raised in Venezu-
ela, Mezquita has ties to many
people still in the city and fac-
ing adversity caused by the gov-
ernment.

"I know people who have
been directly affected by what's
going on," he said. "The streets
are covered with tear gas daily,
people hear shots in the streets
at all times, there are parts of
the city that are completely
unable to be transited due to
burning cars, militia, guards
just blocking the. It is total
chaos at this point."
Diaz said the protest was
successful in bringing the issue
to the University community's
attention and spurring dia-
logue.
"I think the event created a
lot of awareness, not just for the
University students, but in gen-
eral," she said. "I think these
voices that were heard today
are going to keep carrying on;

Congressman hails
University's 10-year
partnership with
ecology group
ByALLANAAKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
The longest-serving mem-
ber of Congress visited campus
Tuesday to commemorate the
University's 10-year partner-
ship with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and the Detroit
River International Wildlife
Refuge.
Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.) joined alumni, faculty
and students from the School
of Natural Resources and the
Environment in the Dana
Building for a press conference
to laud the collaboration's suc-
cess.
The event was prompted by
the Detroit River IWR's recent

hiring of Catherine Dennis, a
SNRE alum. Dennis will join
three other SNRE alumni hired
by the Detroit River IWR inthe
last 10 years.
The speakers at the con-
ference included SNRE Dean
Marie Lynn Miranda, SNRE
Prof. Bob Grese and John Har-
tig, Detroit River IWR refuge
manager.
The University's partnership
with the Detroit River IWR
began, just three years after the
project first commenced. The
SNRE also partners with the
Detroit River IWR for graduate
training by sending students to
the site to do field-based work
and using the Detroit River
IWR's resources to teach criti-
cal concepts in landscape archi-
tecture.
The Detroit River IWR is
the only international wildlife
refuge in North America and
one of the major metropolitan
wildlife refuges in the country.

Harvard breaks donation record

F Nk % AL AL. Mww qw

Harvard University ranks
second in fundraising among
American universities, the Har-
vard Crimson reported Feb.
12. In fiscal year 2013, the Ivy
League institution raised $792
million, a 21-percent increase
from fiscal year 2012 and the
most raised by Harvard in a
single year.
According to the Council
for Aid to Education ranking,
Stanford University again beat
out Harvard for the top spot,
trumping the Ivy League school
by more than $100 million.
Stanford has remained in first
place for nine consecutive years
despite Harvard's "Stanford
Campaign," which was created
to gain the top fundraising title.

Harvard's newest campaign,
which launched in September,
aims to raise $6.5 billion - the
largest campaign goal ever for
an institution of higher educa-
tion.
Also on the list, the Uni-
versity of Southern California
ranked third while Columbsia
University ranked fourth.

City council addresses
disputed arts funding

Members change
ordinace but defer on
final decision
By MATT JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
Cash just complicates every-
thing.
The Ann Arbor City Council
debated and voted on a trifecta
of issues regarding the alloca-
tion of city public art funds
Tuesday, a night when only
Councilmember Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3) was absent.
The most significant resolu-
tion, related to the other two
resolutions, was the return of
uncommitted public art funds
- amounting to $819,005 - to
their original sources.
This resolution would return
the funds to various infrastruc-
ture needs including water, sew-
age, street and energy funds,
among others - but council
postponed a decision on that
transfer. The Council debated
three separate agenda items
regarding the issue.
The first issue tackled was the
resolution to amend the city's
public art ordinance. Council-
members voted unanimously
to pass the resolution, which
makes it possible for the Coun-
cil to amend any budget - both
future and present - to return
any uncommitted public art
funds to their original sources.
However, before voting on the
resolution to return the funds,
the Council debated and even-
tually postponed a motion to
establish a timeline for the city's
Public Art Commission to create
a plan to ease its transition into
its future without funding.
Councilmember Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) said he
believes the resolution is sim-
ply micromanagement, and said
City Administrator Steve Pow-
ers should take care of the tran-
sitional finances himself since
it is within his power as city
administrator.

"These issues can be left to
the administrator, and when he
submits the administrative bud-
get to Council, he will address
what needs to be done in order
to finish up the public art pro-
grams that have been under
way," Kunselman said. "The
resolution that we're discussing
right now loads this effort up by
directing the administrator to
do something he already needs
to do."
Kunselman added that while
he does want to create a steady
environment for the Public Art
Commission to make the tran-
sition, public art supporters are
creating tension by "badgering"
councilmembers.
"I did make a commitment
last year that we are going to get
through this transition," Kun-
selman said. "But it's difficult
when you're getting badgered by
some members of the public art
community who seem to think
that we're all doing it wrong and
only they do it right."
Councilmember Sabra Bri-
ere (D-Ward 1), the sponsor of
the resolution, responded to the
allegations of micromanage-
ment by stating the city needs
the resolution in order to have
strict guidance during the tran-
sitional period as the arts com-
mission adjusts to the reduced
funding.
"Whether those funds get
returned tonight or not, we still
need to give guidance to the
Public Art Commission and, by
extension, to the city admin-
istrator to finalize a plan for
the transition," Briere said. "I
appreciate the concern that this
might be micromanaging, but to
me, it's reaffirming."
After the postponement of the
resolution to establish a transi-
tional timeline, the Council dis-
cussed and also postponed the
vote on the main issue of wheth-
er or not to return the public art
funds to their original purpose
of infrastructure.
Councilmember Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2), one of the spon-
sors of the resolution, argued

that the Public Art Commission
should not be allowed to "keep
the money around just in case,"
and said the Commission rou-
tinely provides a laundry list of
possible future public art proj-
ects to simply keep the money in
its hands.
Councilmember Jack Eaton
(D-Ward 4), also a sponsor of
the resolution, said it would
be effective because it allows
the Public Art Commission to
continue the already approved
projects without sending the
message that the commission
must make the decision to either
"spend the money on bad art" or
lose the funds.
"We should encourage (the
Commission) to be selective in
the art that they do spend their
own money on," Eaton said.
The city no longer has a pub-
lic art administrator to lead
the projects that are already
approved, and the resolution
would provide $20,500 to com-
plete the already approved
projects that would probably be
used to fund the position for six
months.

friends. It's all based on sharing."
To , accommodate larger
groups, Yon said the restaurant
will feature large flattop grill
tables with the capacity to seat
as many as eight people at a time.
The interior of the restaurant
will mirror the contemporary
atmosphere of Tomukun Noodle
Bar. The new restaurant will be
located next door to Tomukun
Noodle Bar at 505 E. Liberty
St., which will be connected for
for employees to move back and
forth between the two locations.
Yon said he plans to use the
front patio, and add a mini bar
during the summer.

The menu consists of a vari-
ety of raw and marinated meats
that will be cooked on the table
grill, hot pots for several diners
to share and traditional Korean
appetizers, including tang soo
yook and kimchi pancakes.
The eatery will also serve beer
in pitchers and will offera line of
flavored soju, a Korean distilled
drink. Individual soups will be
available as well.
The prices will range from $15
to $20 and will include side dish-
es called banchan.
Tomukun Korean Barbecue
will cater to the dinner crowd
during weekdays and Sundays
from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m., and the
time will be extended to 1a.m. on
Fridays and Saturdays. From 10
p.m. until 1 a.m. on the extended
nights, only guests 21 and older

will be permitted to dine in. The
owners said they hope to eventu-
ally open for lunch.
As a second-generation
Korean, Yon said opening this
restaurant means a lot to him
personally, as he hopes to bring
a contemporary feel to Asian cui-
sine.
"I'm more excited about this
Korean barbecue restaurant
than I ever was for the noodle
bar," Yon said. "Just because as
being Korean American myself it
hits so close to home, and it's by
far my favorite type of food."
Yon added that his travels to
bigger cities with larger Asian
populations inspired his idea of
opening Tomukun Korean Bar-
becue.
LSA sophomore Jessica
Greenspan said she hopes the

atmosphere of the Tomukun
Noodle Bar transfers into the
new restaurant.
"I really liked the noodle bar,
and I like interactive restau-
rants," Greenspan said.
LSA freshman Eric Hur said
he is looking forward to the
communal aspect that the new
restaurant will bring to campus,
though there are other nearby
Korean barbecue establish-
ments, such as Rich J.C. Korean
Restaurant and Kang's Korean
Restaurant.
"There isn't really a place you
cango toon campus forlike Kore-
an barbecue," Hur said. "I mean
we have Rich J.C. and Kang's,
but it's the first place where you
can go to have that social aspect
of Korean barbeque. It'll be a
fresh twist on campus."


WILDLIFE
From Page 1A
It encompasses Humbug Marsh,
which Hartig said is designated
as a "wetland of international
importance."
In his address, Dingell said the
refuge has preserved and protect-
ed lands, as well as opened them
up to public use.
"We're leaving the wildlife
here to be enjoyed and be loved
and be seen and we're doing it
under one of the great conserva-
tion organizations in the world,
the Fish and Wildlife Service," he
said.

Some SNRE faculty said they
are grateful for the University's
partnership with the refuge. At
the conference, Miranda said she
felt optimistic about upholding
the arrangement in the future,
stressingthe common goals of the
SNRE and the refuge.
"I feel that Congressman Ding-
ell, the school and the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service hold a very
strong core value in common and
that is a deep and unrelenting
commitment to the preservation
and protection and sensible use of

ment," Miranda said.
In comments at the event, Grese
said the partnership aids the
school's students and helps train

them to analyze an environment's
unique ecological and social
characteristics, as well as create
designs to harmonize the two.
"The refuge has been a really
important laboratory for use in
terms of looking at ways we can
use our unique design scales as
ecological designers, to try to
restore important habitats and
create places that really connect
people with nature as a part of
the urban metro area in Detroit,"
Grese said.
When introducing Dingell,
Hartig lauded the congressman's
persistent efforts to preserve and
protect the environment. During
his tenure in Washington, Dingell
helped pass the Clean Water Act

of 1972, the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 and the Marine Mam-
mal Protection Act of 1972.
"Every time the U.S. Wild-
life Services has needed a voice
in Washington on conservation
and sustainability, Congressman
Dingell has been the first person
to stand up and walk the walk,"
Hartigsaid.
Duringhis speech, Dingell men-
tioned the beauty of the natural
environment, referencingthe work
of President Theodore Roosevelt
and his efforts in sustainability.
"God didn't make many of these
wonderfulplaces and it's a wonder-
ful world he gave us," said Dingell.

Abraham said she has focused
her attention on forUM's acces-

"My ideal is that it happens an-

demands are echoed in the Black
Student Union's recent set of
seven demands to the University.
Ransby's speech set the
tone and mission for the event,
addressing what she said is the
institutionalized racism at the
University. Ransby said it has
seeped into the structure of the
school as well as the lives of its
students.
She said addressing the issue
requires the University to rethink
its definitions of diversity and
challenge its notion of excellence
and standards when considering
which applicants to admit.
"If we're going to embrace the
notion of diversity, it has to be
one that is contextualized and
that is unapologetically political,"

she said. "We can have a Baskin-
Robbins, pick your favorite flavor
of diversity, which is cosmetic and
decorative, or we can have a ver-
sion of diversity that says inclu-
sion is based on the history of
exclusion and oppression."
Rackham student Austin
McCoy, UCRJ co-chair, said in
his speech that movements such
as the #BBUM campaign have
raised awareness among people
on campus and have inspired
events like Speak Out. He said
this systematic approach is ,an
important aspect of the event.
McCoy said despite any cur-
rent plans in place, there needs
to be a new system in regard to
how the University operates
overall. He said the Speak Out
approach is to include a wide
range of participants to gain a
variety of voices.
"This event has a mass base -
there's a lot of people from dif-

ferent backgrounds, and I think
that's one thing that sets this
apart from, say, the Freeze Out
Follow Up," he said.
In her speech, Ransby empha-
sized the importance of events
like this are for the University
climate. She responded to Dud-
erstadt's remarks about the cam-
pus's improvements to diversity,
adding that the school should not
celebrate how far it has have
come in the name of racial justice
because it can be dangerous and
misleading.
Ahmad Rahman, associate
professor of history at the Uni-
versity of Michigan-Dearborn,
who was a graduate student in
Ann Arbor, said he feels that
progress through diversity at the
University is hardly advancing at
all.
"I come here now because we
do research in this library, and
last year when I came here I was

shocked - on two floors of the
library I never saw a Black stu-
dent," he said. "Everyone was
studying for midterms and there
was not a single Black student on
either floor of the library, and I
had never seen that when I was a
student here."
Students each had a turn to
speak up about their experiences
as students at the University and
how they were affected by the
lack of diversity. Rackham stu-
dent Leslie Upton, a volunteer at
the event and president of Stu-
dents of Color of Rackham, said
she too sees a lack of diversity on
campus.
"There's this idea of beinga bit
isolated, and really trying to find
a community," she said. "That's
what I think is cool about this
event is that it's bringing together
so many different types of people
and works against that feeling of
isolation."

After deliberating for more
than an hour, the Assembly fast-
tracked a resolution supporting
the #BBUM movement in the run-
up to a Friday meeting between

top University administrators and
#BBUM organizers.
Public Policy senior Greg Terryn,
an author of the resolution, said the

"It gives (#BBUM organizers)
the ability to speak not only on
behalf of their movement but on
behalf of the student body," Ter-
ryn said.
In an interview after the meet-
ing, Business senior Shayla Scales,

a member of the Black Student
Union said Friday's meeting will
focus on the BSU's budget and
minority enrollment within the
context of the current legal frame-
work.
Last week the Assembly passed
a resolution that addressed minor-
ity student enrollment, calling for
a Dream Scholarship for undocu-
mented students, and addressed
other issues regarding diversity.
However, the resolution was only
passed after language regarding
#BBUM, the BSU and its seven
demands was removed.
Three representatives and
three leaders of the BSU wrote last
week's resolution, which did not

make mention of the BSU or the

constructive dialogue between
#BBUM organizers and the Uni-

"I want to make something
abundantly clear: This is not a bill
about affirmative action," Mays
said when introducing the resolu-

A better balance
Universities should ensure researchers can effectively teach classes
obert Trivers, an evolutionary biologist, sociobiologist and professor
of anthropology and biological sciences at Rutgers University, was
suspended from the school for admitting to his students that he
was unfamiliar with the subject of their course. Trivers, whose expertise
is in social evolution, sexual selection and reciprocal altruism, was instead
assigned to teach a course on human aggression by the university. The case
has brought to light the controversial issue of teaching requirements for
research professors, who are often asked to instruct outside their specialty.
This also been noted to happen at the University of Michigan, at the expense
of the student experience. However, allowing students to access researchers
in their field of study is invaluable to their education. The University must
ensure that professors are comfortable with what they're asked to teach, and
must explore other instructing options when they aren't.

Trivers explained to The Chronicle of
Higher Education that he told his "Human
Aggression" students in the first lecture he
knew little about the subject and would be
learning the material along with them. He also
recruited the help of the previous instructor
of the course, Professor Amy Jacobson, to give
a few lectures. Shortly thereafter, Rutgers
suspended Trivers with pay for refusing
to teach the course and "inappropriately
involving students in the dispute." Rutgers
is currently moving to suspend the esteemed
professor without pay.
While it's important that universities
support the research being done on their
campuses, the quality of education that the
students receive must be of equal concern.
It's indisputable that the University holds its
research faculty in high esteem. However, an
excellent researcher oftentimes doesn't make
an excellent instructor. The skills needed for
teaching are immensely different from those
needed forresearch. I
When a case such as Trivers' arises, hiring
an outside lecturer rather than forcing an
unwilling professor to provide mediocre
quality of instruction is a viable alternative. In
fact, that practice is becoming more common
with some studies supporting the notion

that students learn more when taught by an
outside instructor as opposed to a tenured
professor. specifically, the National Bureau of
Economic Research found that Northwestern
University students taught by untenured
professors were more likely to take a second
course in that subject and earn a higher grade
than students whose first course was taught
by a tenured professor. The University should
consider hiring outside instructors instead of
asking researchers to teach courses they aren't
comfortable with.
It's also important to consider what
support and training for new teachers
the University provides. The Center
for Research on Learning and Training
offers a teacher orientation program and
several teaching seminars for professors
who are not accustomed to classroom
instruction students. However, there are few
requirements regarding which programs
and how many programs an instructor
must participate in. The University - along
with being sensitive about which courses it
assigns to professors - should mandate that
professors attend some of these seminars.
While supporting researchers, the University
must also ensure that students are receiving
the best possible quality of instruction.

capitalism's inherent connection
to sexism, explores the theory that
our culture forces heterosexual
women into obsession with being
part of a couple.
The Gang, and the article's
primary writer Clemence X,
argues that, because men tend
to monopolize the intellectual,
political and artistic realms of
our patriarchal society, women
only gain access to those male-
centric spaces through romantic
relationships. Furthermore, our
culture promises women that we
will be more sexually, socially and
spiritually fulfilled if we glom onto
a man and the power he possesses.
This turns pairing off into a top
priority for heterosexual women,
making single ladies feel like "loose
dogs" - unfulfilled, unimpressive
and uncomfortable in environments
dominated by established couples
(i.e. beinga fifth wheel).
In this way women are slaves to
the Couple Form, and The Gang
argues that we need to free ourselves
in order to be recognized as the
individuals and leaders we truly are.
Admittedly, these ideas are
radical, and exclude the outlying
men and women who have worked
hard to become exceptions to these
rules. But their argument is also
painfully accurate in many respects.
At one point, the article says
women are so obsessed with their
love lives that "they interact not
to deepen their connection to each
other, but to gossip about boys, to
process their relationships with

men ..." When I read that, I was
filled with horror, embarrassment
and a heavy string of questions.
Now I offer these questions to you.
Ladies, when you are in a space
occupied solely by women - sipping
margaritas on girl's night, on a
hurried walk to class with your best
friend or at a party with women you
barely know - how long does it take
before the conversationturns to men?
An hour, half an hour, five minutes? It
seems like a reflex, a default topic for
straight women everywhere who are
trying to find common ground.
We too often resort to discussing
our love lives in varying degrees
of detail. If we see a friend for the
first time in a long while, it doesn't
feel like we've caught up until we
divulge our current relationship
statuses. And then, if one of us is
single, we are forced to say so in an
almost apologetic fashion.
"Um," we mutter, "I'm not seeing
anyone right now."
"oh, that's OK," responds the
other woman with a sympathetic
glance.
For one thing,
it is degrading to
get this reaction Ladies, hov

this question belittles the other
events and struggles at work in
our lives. Why don't we instead ask
about family, friendships, jobs and
the accomplishments that we work
so hard to achieve?
We often go as far as to set
aside time with other women
to work through the confusion
and excitement surrounding our
romantic relationships. We get
together just to speculate about
what's going on in the heads of
men we're dating, and to validate
our actions and reactions toward
our own romances. Who among us

Why do we need other people
- other women - to confirm that
our feelings, suspicions and actions
are reasonable?
When I've mentioned this subject
to my male friends, they've basically
scoffed. "Why don't you just ask the
guy what he thinks?" they say. Well,
to be honest, I'm not totally sure.
Perhaps we worry about confirming
the "emotional woman" stereotype,
so we hide our feelings and opinions.
Maybe we are afraid of being
burned by the "unemotional man"
stereotype, so we lose our confidence.
Even more importantly, this
reaction from my guy friends tells me
that they don't do this as much. They
talk to each other about their love
lives, but probably not as frequently
orwith as much vigor. So, whyus and

our oppression. And I know we do

issues, .scientific discoveries and
politics; we use our brains as well
as our hearts. But we could do more
often. I can't help but think we would
be closer to gender equity - and to
each other - if we put discussions
about men on the back burner and
focused on our own passions, desires
and ambitions instead.

Working out the renovations

Following the #BBUM (Being Black at the
University of Michigan) movement on Twitter,
the ideaofal10-percent enrollment rate of Black
students became prevalent. Many people of all
races had a lot to say about this.
Some folks said we brought this upon
ourselves by attending a Predominantly White
Institution, or PWI, rather than a Historically
Black College or University, or HBCU.
Some people asked us questions like, "Why
are you mad that you're the only Black person
in your class?"
I analyzed this question to myself several
times before forming an actual response. But
now I finally know the reason why. According
to the Lippi-Green folk theory of race, race is
biological, not a social construct. Therefore,
my discontent supposedly derives from my
desire to be around other Black people. That is
why I'm assumed to "sit with them in the lunch
room." However, that is not the case for me. I
highly value diversity.
The Lippi-Green critical theory of race
states that racism is actually a socially
constructed, collective system that was
created throughout history. And the
University of Michigan is a prime example of
institutionalized racism and discrimination.
During the #BBUM movement, both white
and Black people were saying that if we were
upset, we should just transfer to an HBCU.
While I have respect for all HBCUs and the
students who attend them, if I wanted to go
to such a university, I would have gone there
my freshman year. I appreciate diversity
very much. The problem is that we love being
Wolverines; we just want more diversity.
Finally, I will explain why I became upset

that there are not Black people in my class,
besides myself, by talking about this University.
The University of Michigan prides itself on
diversity. There are fliers, posters, websites
and social media that all show a diverse
group of people. However, while attending
Michigan, the truth comes out. Just take a look
at the enrollment numbers for undergraduate
students this past fall.
It's unusual to find not only Black people in
my classes but also any other people of color.
The #BBUM campaign demands 10-percent
enrollment because right now, Black students
makeuponly4.65 percentofallundergrads. This
number is unacceptable. Now, I understand the
backlash about affirmative action being illegal;
however, there is a huge difference between
"filling a quota" and doing a substantial amount
of recruiting - something that the University
does not do for people of color.
When I see that I am the only Black person
in my class, I see that the University does not
care about me. I feel intimidated. Why? There
is not a large amount of Black students, which
means that they do not desire to have Black
students (because if they did, they would make
sure that Black students were attending). And
if the University does not desire Black people,
this means that they do not think there are
enough Black people who are "the leaders and
thebest," whichtherefore meansthat Michigan
does not think that there are enough qualified
(intelligent) Black students to admit. Hence,
this states that Black people are not as smart
as other racial groups on campus. That is why I
feel intimidated, and that is why Iam mad.
Simon Rivers is an LSA junior.,

Above the entrance to the
Michigan Union stand two statues:
the Scholar and the Athlete. They are
said to represent two of the virtues
that go into the quintessential
Michigan Wolverine. By default, I
think I am more the scholar than
the athlete. My basketball career
ended prematurely in fifth grade,
and my high school tennis record
was never going to get me into
Wimbledon. Yet, during my time as
a student at the University, I have
become increasingly aware of the
importance of staying physically
active in maintaining my mental,
physical and emotional health.
My freshman year, I struggled to
stay active. With an erratic schedule
of classes, work and student orgs, I
needed to find a way to exercise on
my own time. Enter: the Intramural
Sports Building. The classic fagade,
reflecting that early 20th-century
style ubiquitous throughout the
University's campus, gave the
impression of grandeur and splendor.
Perhaps, 30 years ago, this impres-
sion would have held true. My first
visits to the IM Building, and later
the Central Campus Recreation
Building and the North Campus Rec-
reation Building, were categorized
by disappointment. Waiting to use
broken treadmills in the dungeon
of the CCRB, whose lack of natural
lighting will always instill in me the
slight fear that I will never escape,
became a regular and expected part
of my day. Learning to navigate the
confusing and convoluted buildings
felt like an extra three credits in my
schedule. Even today, Iam convinced

that some of the treadmills in the IM
Building are preparing to celebrate
their own bicentennial anniversary
in tandem with the University.
This week, we have an opportu-
nity to bring the Recreational Sports
facilities into the future.
Building a Better Michigan led
a student-driven initiative last year
to secure funding to renovate the
IM Building, CCRB, NCRB and the
Union. The University's Board of
Regents approved a proposal for
$173 million to fund these projects,
and the first of these renovations,
Mitchell Field, breaks ground next
week. Renovations to the Rec Sports
buildings, meanwhile, are on track to
begin in 2015.
The building architects will be
hosting two town hall meetings
this week, on Wednesday, Feb. 19
at 7 p.m. in the Pierpont Commons
Caf6, and on Thursday, Feb. 20 at 7
p.m. in Angell Hall Room G127. The
architects hope to hear from students
about the specific needs and goals
they want to see in the renovation
projects. If you believe that our
Recreational Sports facilities are
not living up to the standard of the
University, I hope that you will come
out and make your voice heard. The
input generated from these short
focus groups will be reflected in the
building updates.
We have heard students' calls for
the buildings to be updated, but they
will not renovate themselves. The
Office of Student Life, Recreational
Sports administrators and the
architects leading the renovations
need to hear student support to

determine the path for the updated
spaces. We want to hear from the
heavy gym users to determine the
equipment that is most needed, and
how space can be best allocated. We
want to hear from casual gym users
to learn about what you enjoy most
out of your trips to the gym. And
we want to hear from non-users
to help us figure out how to make
the buildings more accessible and
invitingthan they are now.
Last week, I had the opportunity
to visit the recently renovated recre-
ational facilities at the University of
Illinois and Purdue University with
Building a Better Michigan and the
Rec Sports architects. The facilities
were immaculate. Full of natural
lighting and modern equipment, the
buildings were everything that agym
needs to be. However, I was most
impressed by the community that
the buildings helped to build. It was
clear that students enjoyed their time
at the gym.
With upcoming renovations to
the IM Building, CCRB and NCRB,
I believe that future Michigan stu-
dents will have a greater opportu-
nity to fulfill the vision of a Michigan
Wolverine as a scholar and athlete.
As students, we must ensure that our
voices are represented in the renova-
tion process. The Rec Sports build-
ings have played an integral role in
my time as a Michigan student, and
I hope to leave a legacy so that future
Michigan students can have the same
experience in facilities that are only
fitting for the leaders and the best.

Famed director to
bring 'Suit' to A2

Learning
to orgive

Peter Brooks to
present latest work
at the Power Center
By NICHOLAS WILLIAMS
DailyPhoto Editor
Known as one of the foremost
contributors to modern theatre,
director Peter Brook brings his
latest work,
"The Suit" to The Sut
the Power Cen-
ter. Over his February19to
71-year career, 22 at7:30 p.m.
Brooks has
done every- Power Center
thing from $24-$60 (Student
directing for rush tickets may
the Royal be available.)
Shakespeare
Company in
London, with set designs from
Salvador Dali, to staging Rich-
ard Strauss's Salome, to most
recently working with Th6Atre
des Bouffes du Nord in Paris.
His style is minimalist, often
breaking down works to their
bare bones with subtle sets and
costumes.
"The Suit," which is based on
a story by South African writer
Can Themba, is no different. It's
set in Sophiatown, a legendary
black cultural hub just outside
Johannesburg, during apart-
heid South Africa. The play fol-
lows the story of husband and

wife Philomen (William Nady-
lam) and Matilda (Nonhlanhla
Kheswa). They begin wrapped
in each other's arms living a
blissful love life. That same day
their relationship is smashed to
bits when Philomen, after being
tipped off by his friend returns
home early to find his wife in
the arms of her lover. Instead of
leaving her outright, Philomen
uses his wife's lover's forgotten
suit to exact a cruel and wonder-
ful revenge.
Gillian Eaton, assistant pro-
fessor of theatre at the Univer-
sity, cannot attest to both the
play's and the director's strength
having worked with Brook in the
'70s on a production of "A Mid-
summer's Night Dream."
"'The Suit' is Peter Brook tak-
ing a small story - this time set
in South Africa - and making
that small human story in it's
microcosm: It's pain and suffer-
ing and it's joy and betrayal, and
making it huge," Eaton said in an
official UMS trailer.
The play's set and lighting is
minimal, consistent with Peter
Brook's style. A few chairs are
sprinkled about the stage - a
few lengths of fabric hang sug-
gesting walls.
"I think he has stripped away
much of what we would consider
the normal trappings of theatre
production," said SMT&D pro-
fessor Gary Decker.
Professor Decker went on to

say that Brook views himself
as more of a "story teller than
a director," focusing on "actor
training" rather than straight
directing. In doing so, Brooks
is able to create a very real and
authentic theatre experience
that is in no way over the top.
The Suit's most technical trope
is lighting created by Phillipe
Viallatte, though in line with
Brook's usual style, even this is
subtle.
Theatre des Bouffes's home
theatre in Paris is small when
compared to the vast dimensions
of Ann Arbor's Power Center, so
this production must work to
create that sense of intimacy.
"I bought a ticket pretty close.
... The Power Center is not an
intimate space, it would be up to
the actors to bring (the acting)
up to a high level," Decker said.
He went on to say that that the
he suspects the actors are pre-
pared and have been doing this
work for a long time.
"So what we know - that
we'll always see with him - is
this tremendous humanity and
this cross-border, cross-cultur-
al inquiry about how we love
together and who we are," Eaton
said.
"If you ask any major theatre
director who he emulate or who
he would like to be, he would say
Peter Brook," Eaton continued.
"This is one of those milestone, I
think, in UMS productions."

amends to them all. That was
easy enough, but then comes
Step Nine: "Made direct
amends to such people, when-
ever possible, except when to
do so would injure them or
others."
Here's another important
aspect of forgiveness: Remov-

Forgiveness is
not a sign of
weakness.
You know the guy I drank
at the night I got my DUI?
Well, there's a story there, a
long and complicated story,
one for another time, for a
future novel or-screenplay.
But for now, all that needs to
be known is that there were
plenty of mutual wrongdoings
between us: He harmed me,
but I harmed him, too.
Based on the nature of this
relationship, I had a feel-
ing contacting him to make
amends would "injure him or
others," and it encouraged me
to know that my sponsor had
the same feeling. Instead, she
told me to write him a letter,
a letter that I'll never send. So
I did, and I didn't hold back.
I apologized for my own less-
than-appropriate behavior and
simultaneously expressed my
forgiveness for his indiscre-
tions. Then I folded the pages
and burned them. As I watched
the red-orange flames devour
the years of anger, hatred and
resentment I carried for this
man, this newfound sense of
freedom and release wafted
over me. It's not a magic pill,
it's not a silver bullet - but it's
progress.
Since that first experience,
I've written plenty of letters
that I'll never send anywhere
besides the fireplace. Whether
it's someone in your life who
would do best to stay out of it
or someone who's passed on
and has left you with residu-
al ill will, there is always the
option to forgive those who've
done you harm, to let those
wounds heal, to move on with

your life and leave them to live
theirs.

Sierra Leone-

Ambassador Ishmael Beah is a
prime example of the bond that
grows from disaster, and his sec-
ond novel, "Radiance of Tomor-
row," portrays the kind that
brings a community together.
Born and raised in the south-
ern part of the country, Beah
was separated from his family at
13 and forced tobe a child soldier
in the Sierra Leonean army. For
three years, Beah handled weap-
onry, drugs and faced unthink-
able violence, as highlighted in
his first novel, a memoir entitled
"A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of
a Child Soldier." Beah was res-
cued by UNICEF and began the
long and painful process of rein-
tegration into society after liv-
ing life as a dehumanized killing
machine. He has since become
a Brooklyn-based human rights
activist after graduating from
Oberlin College in 2004.
While Beah is originally from
the town of Mogbwemo, "Radi-
ance of Tomorrow" is set in
Imperi, an extremely rural and
impoverished' area of western
Sierra Leone. Setting the story
in the shadows of the horrific
10-year civil war, Beah weaves
a personal tale of lyrical beauty,
incorporating his worldly views
into a fictional community that
suffers from very real tragedies.
Though English is not his
native tongue, Ishmel Beah is
a fantastic writer with a viv-
idly poetic view of the English
language. As readers immerse
themselves in his novel, they feel

We doo't oee any jumpsuits..
Cult band stitches a
charismatic 'Jumpsuit'

Streaming empire
hopefuls need
quality programs
ByALEX INTNER
Daily Arts Writer
Last year, the online giant
Amazon sent shockwaves
through the industry by releas-
ing its television pilots to the
public and allowing feedback
and streaming count to be a
part of its decision process for
ordering new series. Earlier this
month, the company released
this year's batch. There are
three comedies and two dra-
mas up for consideration. Out of
those, at least one from each cat-
egory should get a pickup. This
year's group contains series
from several high profile writ-
ers, including the return to TV
for Chris Carter ("The X Files")
and a potential series from "The
Wire"'s Eric Overmyer.
What separates this year's
bundle from the last one is the
inclusion of the two dramas:
"The After," a post-apocalyptic
drama and "Bosch," a cop drama
starring Titus Welliver ("Lost").
After viewing therm, it's clear
that neither drama is perfect. In
"The After" 's 55-minute run-
ning time, only the last twenty
advance the story; it takes a long
time to introduce the conflict,
which makes the rest almost
useless to the overall arc.

"Bosch" doesn't have the
same pacing issues, but it's
yet another show with a male
antihero. Welliver is a bril-
liant actor doing a great job,
but that's not enough to make
"Bosch" a series. The show has
two ongoing stories, one follow-
ing a civil suit involving Bosch
killing a man and another in
which he solves the murder of
a child. Unfortunately, neither
is particularly interesting. Even
with Overmyer's name on the
show, it fails to live up to expec-
tations.
Amazon's breakout show is
not a drama, but a "comedy."
"Transparent" stars Jeffrey
Tambor ("Arrested Develop-
ment") as Mort, a transgen-
der father who gets his kids
together in order to come out
to them. Despite some flaws,
especially in its portrayal of
Mort's adult children as whiny
brats, "Transparent" is the best
in the bunch. Tonally, it's more
of a dramedy, following in the
footsteps of shows like "Girls."
There are jokes, but the best
moment is when Mort gives
a monologue discussing his
inability to come out to his kids.
Once the kids are figured out,
this show could build a lot of
buzz for the streaming service.
The other two comedies are
not as strong. "The Rebels" is
much more of a generic sitcom,
with punchlines galore and a
cocaine-snorting, gun-shooting
monkey. Unfortunately, all the

gags not involving the monkey
fall flat, even though they are
presented by actors such as Nat-
alie Zea ("Justified") and Josh
Peck ("Drake and Josh").
The third comedy, "Mozart
in the Jungle," suffers from a
collection of bland characters,
even though they are drug-
using musicians who play great-
classical music. The series is
helped by its setting in the
world of classical music in NYC,
providing a backdrop that the
show can build upon.
Clearly, "Transparent" is an
easy pickup. It has an interest-
ing premise and fixable flaws.
As for the rest, it's going to
come down to whether Ama-
zon thinks the shows' issues are
fixable. "The After" 's pilot had
pacing issues, but Carter's name
gives one hope that they can be
solved. On the other hand, "The
Rebels" is generic and bland,
and Amazon really shouldn't
bother with it. "Mozart" shows
more potential than "Bosch" to
develop as it expands its world
and adds layers to its charac-
ters.
Amazon has some tough
decisions ahead as it tries to
build a streaming empire that
can compete with Netflix. With
"Transparent," the service has
what could be its first break-
out hit. With the other four, it's
going to take some work to bring
them up to par with shows like
"House of Cards" and "Orange
is the New Black."

Few bands in the indie rock
world are as idiosyncratic as
Guided by Voices. Motiva-
tional Jump-
suit marks the
band's 20th
record and, Motvational
startlingly,
their fifth Jumpsui
since reunit- Guided by
ing only two Voices
years ago.
In its many Guided by
years of exis- Voices,Inc.
tence, Guided
by Voices has
built up a cult following and
created some left-of-the-dial
classics, and this new record
contains much more of the
same. It's not the best introduc-
tion point for people unfamiliar
with the band, but it continues
the sound that made it success-
ful.
Those who don't know
Guided by Voices will find that
most of their albums sound
like Green Day getting wasted
before a show in some dive bar
in the South. The recording
quality skews lo-fi, but if you
don't get scared off by the dirty
sound, you'll find some surpris-
ingly catchy melodies, such as
on the upbeat singing of the
opening track, "Littlest League
Possible."
Obviously, when a band

releases five albums in two
years, with each album contain-
ing about 20 songs each, not
every track is going to be great.
Motivational Jumpsuit averages
out at less than two minutes
per song, which means that any
song you don't like will prob-
ably be quickly overtaken by
one you do. Everything on the
album flies by, with the tracks
often feeling more like sketches
than fully-developed tracks.
By the time you get a feel for a
song, it's already over.
As expected, the album con-
tains some great tracks and a
decent number of throwaways.
Singer Robert Pollard has
never given a fuck about qual-
ity control (this is a man who
once released a live album that
consisted solely of his between-
song banter with the audience),
but as with any GBV album, his
expert songwriting is on dis-
play here, particularly with the
unusually fully-developed clos-
er "Alex and the Omegas" and
the funny, catchy "Vote For Me
Dummy."
Today, GBV might sound a
little older, but very little seems
to have changed in its style
since the '90s. They're still the
cult heroes of the nearly for-
gotten era before indie rock
went mainstream, playing the
same music now for older fans
and younger ones who have
discovered them thanks to the
Internet. Motivational Jump-

suit, like its predecessors, is pop
rock with enough grunge sen-
sibility and all-around weird-
ness to keep it from being more
than a niche success. However,
that doesn't mean it's not great
music: Instead, it's riffy and
groovy, even unexpectedly
pretty in spots. Stuck in that
strange chasm between main-
stream and avant-garde, Guided
by Voices simply choose to give
fans the charismatic rock they
want.
The group stumbles most
when they try to stray from
the straight-forward. Tracks
like "A Bird With No Name"
and "Go Without Packing"
are way outside of the band's
comfort zone, taking on an
acoustic, vaguely English, folk
sound, with miserably failing
results. The mistaken experi-
ments are, however, par for the
course and to be expected of
any GBV record. The beauty of
a band releasing such a ridicu-
lous amount of material is that
every fan will have completely
different favorites. Guided by
Voices mixes it up enough on
Motivational Jumpsuit that
nothing gets too old, and even
Fame and
fortune aren't
what GBV
aspires to.
the bad stuff is pretty easily
digested.
The more you listen to its
songs, new and old, the more it
becomes clear that Guided by
Voices could've easily chosen
to become much more famous
as working-class-style rock-
ers. A bigger label, higher-
quality recording techniques
and a focus on longer songs
(and, by extension, longer cho-
ruses) could've made them a
Kings of Leon-type millionaire
rock band. Fame and fortune,
though, are not in their cards.
Pollard and the band prefer to
write songs on their own terms:
releasing everything they can
without any second thoughts
or rewrites. They want fans,
but only fans who will accept
them for exactly who they are
- and anyone who listens to an
album as strong as Motivational
Jumpsuit will have no problem
accepting them.

four games last season.
Despite the offensive success,
Detroit's defense is rebuilding
after goaltender AJ Lewell,
the program's saves leader,
graduated. Lewell is now on the
sidelines as an assistant coach
for the Titans, which will turn to
goaltender Connor Flynn to keep
the ball out of the net.
The teams last met in 2013 at
Michigan Stadium. The Titans
led 4-3 midway through the
second quarter, but a severe
thunderstorm hit and postponed
the rest of the game. The match
was never finished.
The only result between the
teams came two years ago at
the Ultimate Soccer Arena in
Michigan's first Division I game.
The Titans were victorious, 13-9,
behind a combined seven goals
from Adams and Maini.
After a first win early in their
schedule, the Wolverines need
to continue to assert themselves
as Division I contenders. A win
against Detroit would go a long
way in doing just that.

Daily Sports Writer
The offseason is a time
when most coaches take it a
little easier, especially during
Christmas break. The coaches
could spend time with their
families exchanging gifts and
holiday cheer, but that wasn't
the case for assistant volleyball
coach Erin Virtue.
Rather than sitting around
the fire with her family and
friends, she was standing on the
volleyball court with some of the
best coaches and teenage players
in the country.
Virtue was busy this holiday
breakcoachingthe USAVolleyball
High Performance Girl's Holiday
Camp in Colorado Springs, Colo.
A total of 48 top players in various
age groups across the nation were
given the opportunity to train in
the five-day camp.
When Virtue graduated from
Illinois in 2005, she started
training with the national team.
Virtue was a standout volleyball
player and helped led the
Fighting Illini to a spot in the
Sweet Sixteen in 2003, earning
All-Big Ten and All-American
Honorable Mention accolades.
Virtue trained with the national
team for a year before she coached.
She has worked her way up from
an assistant to an associate head
coach and finally earned the
opportunity to coach one of the
highest programs over break -the
seventh- and eighth-grade team.
"The high-performance
program is a pipeline for young
athletes to make their way from
ages 12 up until they get to the
senior USAnational team,"Virtue
said. "It's a good introductory
course for them. If they were,
10 years from now, to be on the

national team ... it is good for
them to know what that takes."
Each day was busy with three
two-hour practice sessions
teaching the fundamentals of
volleyball, and two classroom
sessions dedicated to scouting
videos and nutritional
information.
The camp was held at an
Olympic training center complex,
much like a college campus.
Various Olympic athletes train
there year-round or temporarily.
Virtue's athletes ate lunch,
walked through halls and lived in
the dorms with the professionals.
The group Virtue coached
were the best seventh- and
eighth-grade players in the
country, but also the youngest in
the program - a clear difference
from college athletes.
"We were more elementary at
that camp than we would be here
at Michigan," Virtue said. "As
far as the basic techniques and
breakdowns of the skills, those
are things that players from 12 to
32 can be focused on."
Working with the USA
program put Virtue in a place
where she was not only teaching,
but also learning. Virtue worked
alongside experienced coaches
from across the country.
Each athlete knew that Virtue
coached at Michigan. When she
was in the gym, she wore 'USA'
on her back and represented her
country, but she also represented
Michigan and used the
opportunity to scout potential
future recruits.
"I would imagine there was
an Olympian in that bunch
somewhere," Virtue said "I think
it was a pretty special group
and, a lot of those girls, if not all
of them, have a chance to play
somewhere in college."

Freshman Ian King picked Lp his first career goal in the second quarter of Michigan's loss to Penn State on Feb. 8.
Glendening returns to Yost

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
The man wore a maroon
Michigan hockey practice jersey
but also donned clashing bright-
red gloves and breezers.
He participated in the team's
speed drills Tuesday, effortlessly
reaching the other end of the
ice first as his competitors' best
efforts left them several feet
behind. And when most of the
others had skated back into the
locker room, lie took a moment
to challenge the goaltender
crouched in the crease, finding
twine easily and celebrating with
little more than a smile.
The man was Luke Glendeninrg,
who from 2008-12 scored 31 goals
in his 165-game tenure for the
Wolverines.
After graduating, he signed
a one-year contract swith the
American Ilockey League's
Grand Rapids Griffins, helping
them win the AHL championship
and take the Calder Cup in 2012-
13. By the following season, the
Detroit Red Wings had noticed
his success and called him up to
the National Hockey League.
And on New Year's Day this
year, he took the opening faceoff
for the Red Wings against the
Toronto Maple Leafs at the
Winter Classic at Michigan

Stadium in front of a crowd of
more than 100,000.
"It's been a whirlwind,"
Glendening said of his time in
the pros. "It's been a dream come
true, and it's been everything that
I could ever ask for."
The NHL is currently on
sabbatical for the Winter
Olympics, and many of the Red
Wings are in Sochi representing
their respective countries. Those
who aren't receive a much-
deserved break, but they also
try to avoid rust by training
elsewhere during the time off.
So when the Michigan coaching
staff contacted Glendening, he
jumped at the opportunity.
"He just needs ice," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"He just wanted to skate for a
day or two."
Yost Ice Arena looks different
than it did when the forward
played there. Large windows
interrupt the brick of the north
and south ends of the building,
and some of the bleacher seats
have been moved further away
from the ice. But to Glendening, it
still felt like home.
"It looks a lot different than
when I played here, but it's still a
special place to me," he said. "So
many great memories, and it's
fun to be back."
The Wolverines were

different, too. Glendening only
recognized the upperclassmen,
but he took advantage of the
reunion, laughing with senior
defenseman Mac Bennett near
the end of practice.
Joe Louis Arena, not Yost, is
home. Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik
Zetterberg, not Bennett, are his
teammates. His colors are the
red and white of the Winged
Wheel, not the maize and blue of
the block'M.'
After the coaches and most
of the players left, Glendening
stepped off the ice alone. He
spoke briefly to reporters and
then turned away, walking in his
mismatched Michigan shirt and
Red Wings pants into the tunnel.
NOTES: Berenson confirmed
Tuesdayafternoonthatfreshman
defenseman Kevin Lohan
and junior defenseman Mike
Chiasson will play Friday against
Penn State. They'll fill in for
defensemen Michael Downing
and Andrew Sinelli, who were
suspended one game each by the
NCAA for separate incidents in
the Wolverines'loss at Minnesota
last Saturday. ... Berenson also
said junior forward Alex Guptill
"should be good to go" against
the Nittany Lions. He missed
Michigan's series against the
Golden Gophers with an upper-
body injury.

Michigan coach Erik Bakich has helped Ramsey Romano adjust mentally tothe harsh reality of winter in Michigan.
Record-breaking winter no
match for Ra-msey Romano

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
This past weekend marked a
welcome change of scenery for
freshman Ramsey Romano.
The infielder finally got to play
baseball outdoors again, and he
showed no signs of rust, starting
all four of Michigan's games at
the Texas State Tournament in
San Marcos, Texas.
Romano finally found himself
in a similar environment to the
one in El Cajon, Calif., where he
grew up but left to play baseball
for Michigan.
At first, the transition to a
Michigan winter wasn't easy. He
had never experienced playing
indoors before, but it was always
something that intrigued him
because, for Romano, the allure
of receiving a Michigan degree
was too much to pass up.
"It's hard to adapt to (the
weather) coming from California
to here, but I wanted something
different and something new, and
Michigan seemed like the right
choice," Romano said. "Before
you know it, you're playing in
sunny Texas. But it's definitely a
good change."
Romano was right, and he
played like he had never left
the sun. Despite one error, he
registered four hits, a double, one

RBI and a stolen base.
"(Romano) is a baseball player
- he's played a lot more baseball
than most freshmen just being
from San Diego and playing a
lot," said Michigan coach Erik
Bakich. "You can see that from his
instincts and his baseball know-
how. He wasn't scared one bit."
Romano's fearless mentality
is what guided him to start this
season's first four games. A
Michigan winter might be a huge
change for any person who hasn't
experienced consistent snow, let
alone a polar vortex, but Romano
found positives takeaways.
Baseball in Michigan has
its advantages because the
Wolverines have an indoor
practice facility. In California,
many teams don't have indoor
practice facilities, which means
rain could cancel a practice. In
Ann Arbor, though, rain, sleet or
snow won't stop practice.
But even though he's content
to practice every day, he was still
plenty overjoyed to play outside.
"When I got on the field this
last weekend, it was closer to
home with the sun and just
playing and being back on the
field like I'm used to," Romano
said.
And after not being able
to practice outdoors since
November - with the only

;--r-
, __.
!
,«, -

outdoor activities * consisting
of shoveling snow as a team -
Romano showed no signs of rust
in the sun.
Romano consistently played up
to Bakich's standards and proved
he could be a steady contributor
for Michigan's offense and a
mainstay in the infield for years
come.
"I think, in his mind, he
expects to make an impact in this
program," Bakich said. "He was
impressive at the plate and was
very solid defensively."
Romano credits most of his
success to Bakich's coaching
style. The second-year coach puts
a large emphasis on a player's
mental game - something
Romano never worked on before
but was happy to learn.
Romano found Bakich's
mental pointers especially
helpful to combat the butterflies
in his stomach before making his
collegiate debut.
"As a freshman this last
weekend, everything started to
speed upa little bit, and you start
thinking too much and get into
red lights," hesaid.
Romano and the Wolverine§
were welcomed back to Ann
Arbor with three inches of snow.
But Bakich knows that weather
won't stop the Californian from
producing on the field.

The Maize Rage is split between the lower and upper decks, turning the Crisler Center into a less intimidating venue.
Seeding, team chemistry,
e~xpanded student section?

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
What seed do you predict
Michigan will end up with
in the Big Dance? - Nathan
Schweid, @Nathanschweid.
In Joe Lunardi's most recent
'Bracketology' on ESPN.com,
Michigan men's basketball was
tabbed as a
No. 4 seed in MAILBAG
the Midwest
region. Ultimately, I believe the
Wolverines will finish with a
top-4 seeding, with a very strong
possibility of landinga No. 3 seed,
or even a No. 2.
Currently, Michigan sits at
No. 16 in the RPI ratings, but
its strength of schedule, No.
4 in the nation, will be looked
upon very highly on Selection
Sunday, as will the team's wins
in East Lansing, Madison and
Columbus. If Michigan beats
Michigan State on Sunday - and
I believe it will - the Wolverines
assume the driver's seat in the
Big Ten race, and I can't see
the champion of the nation's
toughest conference receiving a
seed lower than a No.2 slot.
Do you think Dave Brandon
pays enough attention to
Michigan basketball's student
section? If so, what is he doing
well, and, if not, what can he
do to improve the experience
and give our team more of a
home-court advantage?- Josh
Schostak, @Its-SchoTime.
Brandon's a money guy, but he
also cares about image - a lot,
actually. Remember, the switch
to general admission for student
tickets had nothing to do with
money and everything to do with
how Michigan Stadium appeared
on television.
Several games this year
have had noticeable pockets
of unfilled seats sprinkled
throughout Crisler Center, with
the exception of the student
sections. Fortunately, Brandon
has two things going for him.
First, even in games with unfilled
arenas, capacities were still
listed as sellouts, meaning the
Athletic Department could cash
its checks for the seats anyway.
Second, television cameras
inside the arena face toward the
Maize Rage and don't pan out as

frequently as they do in football
games, meaning that even a less-
than-full arena still appears to
be hopping and filled to capacity
on television.
There's no question that
CrislerArenawill nevercompete
with the Breslin Centers or the
Assembly Halls of the world
as long as the vast majority
of its student section is in the
upper bowl, but the Athletic
Department is bringing in loads
of money by adding a Preferred
Seat Donation tag to season
ticket holders' seats, in addition
to the per-game price they
already pay. There's no two ways
around it - Brandon is funneling
in boatloads of money by keeping
his high-paying customers close
to the court. As long as he's here,
don't expect any major changes
to the student section inside
Crisler Center.
Should Beilein consider
shortening Glenn Robinson
IIIs minutes if he continues
to let opposing players
go off on him while not
contributing much to the
offense? - Nathan Pilcowitz,
@thepilcofacts.
I think Beilein answered
your question wheni he benched
Robinson for a seove-plus
minute stretch midway through
the second half of last week's
win over Ohio State. Aside
from a 3-pointer late in the
game - and it was a clutch shot
that sealed the Wolverines'
win - Robinson played poorly,
offensively and defensively.
In his place, freshman guard
Zak Irvin came in and drained
a big 3-pointer off the bench,
as he has done so many times
throughout conference play, and
proved to be a major sparkplug.
Irvin is young, and his
defense is nowhere near the
level that Robinson has shown
he can play at, especially when
he's matched up with bigger,
stronger forwards in the post.
The freshmen isn't quite a
complete player yet, but his
ability to knock down shots
and score in bunches off the
bench aren't being ignored. In
Sunday's loss to Wisconsin,
Irvin's shots weren't falling and
he struggled to bring much else
to the table.

But Beilein has shown that
when Robinson is struggling and
Irvin isscoring, he'll lengthenthe
freshman's leash and let him play
for longer and longer stretches.
How have team dynamics
and chemistry in the locker
room changed from last
year after losing two of the
leaders? - Mitchell Shecter,
@shecterm35.
Fascinating question, and I
really think this is one the biggest
changes between this year and
last. You mentioned the loss of
two leaders, of course referring
to TreyBurke and Tim Hardaway
Jr., but remember the Wolverines
also lostfive seniorsto graduation.
With that said, the
cohesiveness of this year's
squad is, by all accounts, in
much better shape than last
year's. The 2012-13 team was
Trey and Tim's, and sometimes
that led to friction. While it has
sometimes appeared that this
year's team belongs to Stauskas
- and it certainly looks like
Michigan is better when he's
at his best - this squad truly
embodies a next-man-up
mentality. Irvin has stepped
up at times, sophomore guard
Caris LeVert has taken hold of
the icigns lately, and Robinson
can't be forgotten. Finally, the
players genuinely seem to like
each other, meshing together
better than last year's awkward
combination of five seniors, five
freshmen and two superstars.
And while it has nothing
to do with who is and isn't
here this year, the opposing
trajectories of the two teams
can't be ignored when it comes
to comparing their psyches.
Last year's 16-0 start may have
softened that team, because
early on, everything was coming
too easy. That showed down the
stretch in the regular season,
and it took some rough losses
- at Penn State and Michigan
State and the heartbreaker to
Indiana in the regular-season
finale - for that team to come
together in order to make the
NCAA Tournament run. This
year's team got some of those
losses out of its system in the
non-conference slate, and its
trajectory has been on the rise
ever since.

WOMEN'S GOLF
'M' struggles in Puerto Rico

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer
Nearly four months have
passed since the Michigan
women's golf team's last
tournament. But when the
Wolverines got off the plane in
Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, the
results were largely the same as
last fall.
Freshman Grace Choi was the
team's top scorer with a career-
high 54-hole 224, but Michigan
finished 13th out of 15 at the Lady
Puerto Rico Classic, which ran
Monday through Wednesday.
No. 8 Arkansas won the event
with a score of 867, 14 strokes
ahead of second place. The
Wolverines edged out 14th-place
Missouri by three and last-place
TCU by four. Six top-25 teams
competed in the event. .
Michigan slipped with a
second-round 307, which tied
for last on the round. Its best day
was the first, when it scored 304.
Still, first-year coach Jan
I

Dowling found improvements
in the Wolverines' game from
the fall. Choi worked in a
couple of technical changes,
and according to Dowling,
sophomore Catherine Peters had
more birdies than in the entire
fall season after working on her
putting over the winter.
"Every individual had some
different aspects of their game
that they were working on,"
Dowlingsaid."One ofthehardest
things to do in competitive golf is
actually implement that change
in the heat of the competition.
They were able to successfully
do that their first tournament of
the spring."
Added Choi: "It's a different
mindset you have to get into. You
have to kind of expect going out
there that you're not going to hit
every shot perfect, notgoing to hit
every putt perfect. We're going to
try to get all of our technical stuff
down, and I felt really good about
my technique."
Once the first round started,

Choi was locked in with help
from Dowling.
Choi shot a plus-l 73 on each
of the first two days, hanging
around the top 15 through
Tuesday. That score tied for ninth
in the tournament on the first day
and tied for 16th on the second.
Choi struggled on the third day,
though, with a plus-6 78 that
brought her down to a tie for 24th.
For Choi, the highlight of the
week occurred after she landed
a drive behind two palm trees
135 yards away from an elevated
green. She then snuck a 5-iron
shot around more palm trees 135
yards away from the hole before
sinkingthe 30-foot birdie putt.
Peters shot consistently,
scoring 76, 76 and 75 to tie for
34th. Senior Yugene Lee finished
with a 231on the week.
Junior Lauren Gregor and
senior Alyssa Shimel each
struggled on the second day,
shooting 81 and 87, respectively.
They finished plus-19 and plus-29
for the tournament.

THE VISUAL STATEMENT: RELENTLESS ROWING

Kinesiology sophomore Emma Burke rinses down the boats' blades after a practice
in Tampa, FL during a spring break training trip.

'W 're not Denard
Robinson or Mitch
McGar. There's
no chance of being recognized in
class, and if we happened to wear a
Michigan Rowing shirt the typical
response is, "Oh, I know someone
that was on the rowing team," or,
"That's a varsity sport?"
A Division I athlete was a label
I never planned to have in college
after turning down offers from
track and field teams at smaller
schools. I didn't even know that
rowing was a college sport until a
few months before trying out. That
didn't make me any less defensive
of the sport to which I had never
expected to dedicate my heart, soul
and time.
Believe it or not, rowing is really
difficult. The team has a huge
turnover of athletes every year,
and there's a reason for that. As 160
freshmen quickly discover, waking
up at 7 a;m. for classes, heading to
practice at 3 p.m., returning to do
homework after 9p.m. and then

attempting to get to bed at a decent
time in order to wake up the next
day and do it all over again is no
easy task. But the 18 freshmen who
stick it out to the end are rewarded
as the few, the proud, the Big Ten
Champions.
As Michigan athletes, we are
expected to be relentless at every
practice, straining our bodies
every day to our physical limits in
order to make our team faster and
stronger. The individual goals we
meet and the glorious triumphs
we earn with our teammates make
these exertions worth it. Still, the
amount we work outside of the
competition context is what truly
measures our dedication. What
defines a student-athlete is how
she functions in her other passions
and relationships, while still being
able to get into the athletic mindset
of kicking ass. It often seems that
there's no personal choice - it's all
about the team, the team, the team.
But that's the choice athletes make.

y ann arbor affairs: falling in friend-love with you by sundai johnson

I moved through those soft,
moist bodies with friendly, inebri-
ated smiles that tend to occupy
those kinds of spaces, and on the
other side, I found him. His eyes
were bright when he saw me, and he
wrapped me in his arms and I melted
there. He began to talk rapidly as he
always did and I smiled and nodded
and responded as I always did. He
led me outside to a group of people
who I knew but would never actu-
ally know. There was a beer waiting
for me in his hand. I took it, sat by
the fire and nursed my beer while I
watched him and remembered the
way we knew each other.
It was the night of my first college
party the summer before freshman
year. We were walking without a
destination as the cool summernight
airbrushed our hot, sticky skin that
made our hands stick together like
Velcro. Finally we came upon a hill
in the middle of a neighborhood, and

when he wanted
to be with other
girls instead of
me. Because
he'd held my
hand and kissed
me on a hilltop
and told me he
liked me. He had
this soul that
was powerful
and captivat-
ing and as much
as I wanted
to walk away
and remember
him only as a
moment in time,
I could not. So
I set aside all
animosity I ILLUSi
had against our
shattered romance and sacrificed
the bitterness I wanted to feel, to
have him as a constant in my life.
We were more beautiful this way
than I'd ever imagined we could be.
The deeper our friendship grew the
more I realized that this was how
things were meant to be. There
was a loyalty that existed between
us that could not have existed had
it been any other way. Not to say
that we weren't reckless with our
friendship at first. We jeopardized
it often with slurred words and sto-
len kisses at late-night after-parties
before I insisted that I make my way
home. We never talked about these
moments - either because they felt
normal or because it was easier to
believe they were imagined. These
moments occurred less frequently
until eventually, they ended all
together. For a time, the memory of
that moment on that hill when time
stood still misguided me and led me
to believe that we were meant to be.
But our world wasn't fit to hold that
kind of love, only the love we had
created that was and would always
solely be ours.

Personal Statement: Party's over, now what?

My beer was still cold in my hand
as we went inside and danced to
music that made us nostalgic. And as
we sat on the couch later that night,
in that house, my head buzzed from
half of a bad beer and happiness and
he was dreamy from slight sobriety,
interrupted by a few puffs of Mary.
For the last time, he leaned over and
kissed me, more softly and sweetly
than he ever had before. It was just
once, slowly on the lips, and as he
pulled away, just for a flicker of a
moment, before he became aware of
what he had unknowingly revealed
to me.
I looked into his eyes and I knew
then thathe loved me and would love
me as long as forever might possibly
be. It was a love that was baffled and
heavy. Full of heard words and apol-
ogies that never had to be spoken.
Our friendship, and this love we'd
cultivated, was whole and intention-
al and deeply anchored in an almost-
romance that had blossomed out of
that summer we'd spent covered in
sundust with hills of grass molding
to the dips in our backs.

lay on our backs, claiming our stake.
After long moments of quiet, I like
you Sundai rolled over his lips like a
melody. I turned toward him - not
smiling because he wasn't - and
told him I liked him too. And then
he turned toward me, and finally
he was smiling, and finally he was
kissing me. We were lying under
the trees, under the stars, and it was
impossible and magical all the same.
What I expected to materialize
after thatnight did not happen. Iwas
angryandsadand hurt andconfused

I remember the day I first moved to Ann
Arbor. It was a very typical, almost arche-
typal University of Michigan "freshman"
experience.
I remember moving into South Quad as a
timid (but eager to "break out of my shell!")
Honors freshman and being bombarded by
a neat arrangement of new friends, thanks
to my Move-In Maker roommate. Before
I had time to unpack my posters of indie
bands and boxes of string lights (because
that's how people decorate their dorms,
right?), I was whisked off to the cafete-
ria - that social jungle of sterile surfaces
and outdated wall decorations - where I
engorged myself on a tray of tofu and chick-
peas. I was going to "try out" vegetarianism
in college.
The conversation at the table was fast-
paced and brutal, but I managed to stay
afloat. Soon after, we ran off to play a game
of pick-up soccer at Elbel Field like the
energetic, fun-loving freshmen Wolverines
we were learning to be. During the game,
I got stomach cramps from all the chick-
peas and thought about the boyfriend I had
just broken up with (because that's just the
inevitable course of events when a couple
goes to different colleges, right?). Later that
night I called him, saying I missed him, of
course.
After getting bubble tea and devouring
free samples from Jimmy John's minions
scattered around campus - all the while
proclaiming numerously how we couldn't
"wait to explore Ann Arbor!" - the focus
of the conversation quickly shifted to par-
ties. We shared with one another the cata-
logue of parties we had been invited to on
Facebook at the various frats we had min-
imal-to-no connection to "G.I. Joes and

party! Oh, but you need a wristband to get
in ...""What's a foam party?" We eventually
settled on a "Blackout Party," and scrolled
through the Facebook event.
"Wear white," the event page read.
Thinking nothing of this incongruous
instruction, we obliged, and headed out
the doors of South Quad in the shape of
a 20-deep crew of freshmen all wearing
white t-shirts. We looked ridiculous, but at
least we had a "good ratio."
We wandered through a block party on
the way over, and realized almost imme-
diately the grave mistake we had made. Of
course the party was a cruel joke. Of course
we were instantly recognized in the crowd.
Of course we endured endless jeers of
"Freeeeeeeshmaaaaaaan" from congested
porches. Of course we attempted to laugh
it off and party on like normal. But after
several unsuccessful and uncomfortable
attempts to get to the keg, we resolved to
give up - at least for that night.
We began our trek back to South Quad
- carrying our white shirts like truce flags
and our solo cups as red as blood spilled on
a battle field. (On our way down Hill Street,
a benevolent upperclassman advised us to
throw out our empty solo cups in order to
avoid the "Minor in Possession" experi-
ence. Thank you, whoever you were).
We were clueless, and while I can't say
that night was fun, I look fondly upon my
failed attempt at partying my first night of
college. And while I can't say that I'm still
friends with all 20 of those people or even
that I would even recognize some of them
should I pass them on State Street, I did
make a few friends - best friends, actu-
ally - several of whom now share the same
co-op with me.

Emerging from the shadows: LGBT life in the locker room
by Jake Lourim

In 2005, Stephanie Hoyer came east from
Englewood, Colo., to one of the biggest college
athletic programs in the country. She prac-
ticed field hockey in the shadows of Michigan
Stadium, and in world-class facilities named
after legends like Schembechler and Yost and
Crisler and Oosterbaan.
Hoyer had a strong freshman season. She
scored six goals, added three assists. She net-
ted a game-winner early in the season, then
later scored in the second round of the NCAA
Tournament.
But that season was nothing compared to
what she would do the following year. The
next fall, she told her teammates the biggest
secret of her life - she was bisexual.
In 2005, in a culture steeped in the uncer-
tainty about how to handle lesbian, gay, bisex-
ual andtransgender people - let alone athletes
- Hoyer was met with open arms.
Playing on the same campus as future
Olympians, Hoyer had a fine situation on the
surface. Her life or someone else's could be
very different right now had it not been for
the compassion she found inside the hallowed
halls of the University Athletic Department.
But to understand how we got here today,
and how Hoyer succeeded at Michigan eight
years ago, you must first understand a story
from a similar, yet entirely different college
town and through a sprinter named Paul Far-
ber.
Paul Farber came to the University of Penn-
sylvania in 2001 among a class of about 20
track athletes seeking an Ivy League educa-
tion, athletic success and an experience among
the world's brightest people.
Instead, when he stepped on the track early
during his freshman season, one of the first
words he heard was a derogatory gay slur. Far-
ber is gay.
Inside, this environment ate at Farber. He
felt depressed and worn down, physically and
mentally. It was his worst academic semester
yet. At one point, he tried his coach for advice.
But even his coach showed him apathy. He
told him that in his time coaching at Penn, two
athletes had come out and fit in well with the
team. Another, however, ended up getting ina
fight and had to leave the team. "So make sure
you make the right decision," Farber recalled
his coach, Charlie Powell, telling him.
The decision, when it came down to it, was
between being an athlete and being himself -
which, in the end, wasn't much of a choice at
all.
Farber chose himself, quitting the team
his freshman year. The following year, in an
attempt to create a more welcoming environ-
ment for gay athletes than the one he encoun-
tered, he helped establish Penn Athletes and
Allies Tackling Homophobia. Its goal was to
confrontwhathesaw asthe taboo ofhomopho-
bia in athletic culture.
Four years later, Farber's story and Michi-
gan's intersected. Working toward a PhD. in
*16 American Culture at Michigan, Farber became
a GSI for Professor John U. Bacon's class on the

history of college athletics.
Farber skimmed the list of topics in Bacon's
class and noticed that many examined sports
as an avenue for realizing social change, but
homosexuality in athletics was never dis-
cussed in class. So he started the discussion -
or, rather, he brought it out in the open.
"This is an issue that cannot be managed
with silence," Farber said. "It's been on the
back of student-athletes and willing adminis-
trators to carry forward the conversation."
To carry on the conversation at the Uni-
versity, Farber established the Michigan Ath-
letes and Allies Partnership. Similar to PATH,
MAAP created a space for athletes and allies.

teammates, several of whom were gay them-
selves, either open or closeted. When he did,
he found that nothing changed.
"The people who looked back at me after
I came out to them, I just knew that nothing
had changed," Heiter said. "It changed noth-
ing for them. They still saw me as exactly the
same person."
Last week, former Missouri defensive end
Michael Sam, who is projected as an NFL
Draft pick, came out publicly. If selected in
May (a near certainty for the Southeastern
Conference Defensive Player of the Year), Sam
would become the first openly gay NFL player
in a sport known for its masculine locker-
room culture.
Starting Sunday,
Sam will compete at
the NFL Combine,
where NFL teams
will scout him before
the upcoming draft.
He will be judged for
his speed, his hands,
his strength, his per-
sonality and now, per-
haps, his sexuality.
Sam put a lot of
money on the line by
coming out when he
did. Heiter and Hoyer
said they look for-
ward to the moment
when a player like
Sam's news isn't the
news story it has
become - but for
now, they're happy to
watch it unfold.
"I think where we
are right now, it needs
to be a spectacle,"
Hoyer said. "The
attention is neces-
sary. There's been so
ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily much hurt and pain
caused and suffered for
years, for gay people and straight people."
Heiter and Hoyer agreed that everyone has
his or her own journey and that everyone is
ready to come out at different times.
But both of them anticipate the time when
everyone is ready at some point - no matter
how many Michael Sams it takes to get
there.
When a former softball player, who asked
not to be identified by name because she is
not openly gay to everyone, came to Michigan
in 2008, she found an atmosphere in which
homosexuality was a "you-didn't-talk-about-it
thing."
But the culture changed substantially over
the player's four-year career. She told herself
she would be herself at college, and as her
teammates got to know her, that was OK.
"By my senior year, it was just part of who
you are," she said. "You don't need to say it if
you don't want to. We just went along with our

daily lives because it didn't affect anything for
us.
When it stopped affecting things, the player
enjoyed her experience at the University. The
true moment of peace for her came before her
sophomore season, when she was unsure of
how incoming freshmen would respond to her
sexuality.
"We've got your back," the senior players
told her. "We're not going to let anyone say
anything. We'll take care of you."
When the player came to Michigan, MAAP
was already established. For her, it was more
than just a place to go - it was an organization
that carried her through her college experi-
ence and helped her accept who she was.
When she had early college problems, the
group helped her. When she needed a group to
hang out with, the group gave her that too.
Hiding the secret, though, doesn't always
pose a problem. These athletic teams often
become players' families. In fact, Hoyer, Heit-
er and the softball player each told their teams
before they told their families. The team pro-
ceeded normally from there.
Bacon, who spent significant time around
the Michigan Athletic Department while
working on his 2013 book "Fourth and Long,"
said that reaction coincides with what he saw.
."Whatwas acceptable10years ago probably
isn't now," Bacon said. "I didn't have too much
doubt that guys I was around there for three
years would accept a gay teammate."
Sam came out to his team in August.
Because he was openly gay, coaches, support
staff and even some reporters knew he was
gay. According to Yahoo Sports, the Missouri
student newspaper knew Sam was gay before
last weekend. A reporter arranged an inter-
view with him about it, and when he cancelled,
the newspaper didn't run the story.
In each of these cases, the people around
the athletes haven't hidden the secret because
they are avoiding the issue or because they
don't want to create conflict. They have hidden
it because it's not their secret to share.
Think back to Paul Farber. Remember that
not all coming-out stories are like Hoyer's
or Heiter's. Remember that this issue is not
resolved.
Ten years ago, Farber told his coach the
most intimate secret of his life and was met
with apathy. Five years ago, a Michigan soft-
ball player came into an environment in which
homosexuality wasn't discussed. Ten days ago,
a college football player told the world he was
gay, risking his future in the process, doubters
be darned.
There will be a day when an athlete like
Michael Sam tells people he or she is gay and
no one bats an eye. This day might not be
tomorrow, or the next day. It might take more
Evan Heiters and Stephanie Hoyers and Paul
Farbers to get there. But once it comes, they
and the thousands of other people who have
helped make it happen will watch and smile.

she said.
Despite offering a women's gym class and
even introducing a women's basketball team
that played against Eastern Michigan in 1898,
the University didn't offer varsity sports until
they lawfully had to, and didn't comply with
Title IX's mandate on scholarships until 1989.
Equal focus on male and female sports at the
University wasn't given until the ruling of the
1992 Supreme Court case, Franklin v. Gwinnett
County Public Schools, which ruled punitive
damages should be awarded to those who suf-
fered when Title IX is intentionally avoided. It
was then, Hutchins said, that women's sports
finally had the attention of the University Ath-
letic Department.
"Out of those 40 years (of Title IX), the first
20 we weren't playing for championships, we
were playing because we had to have a team
out there," Hutchins said. "We never started
a practice before 8 o'clock in the middle of
the winter because we had to let all the men's
sports go before us. They were fully funded;
we were on shoe strings. Around the mid-90s
we were taken more seriously, and now we're
seeing women's sports looked at based on their
success on the field just like the men are."
Today, the effects of Title IX can be seen
all over the sports world, and Ann Arbor is no
exception. Nearly a million viewers watched
Hutchins' softball team fall to Washington
in last year's Women's College World Series.
Michigan currently boasts 14 varsity women's
sports, one more than men's varsity sports
teams, and the University complies with Title
IX on every documentable level.
Women's participation in sports is at an all-
time high, but according to Sport Management
Prof. Ketra Armstrong, an associate dean of
kinesiology, compliance with the law is only
the first step toward equality.
"Title IX has caused female athletes to have
greater participation and more empowerment
in sports," Armstrong said. "But there were
unintended (bad) consequences. The whole
idea was to provide equality, but what came
with Title IX was a decline in female coaches
and administrators."
Armstrong noted that before Title IX,
women held the majority of administrative
positions in women's sports. Yet after Title IX,
the number of women's coaches for women's
teams dwindled to 43 percent.
Though Armstrong's numbers are based off
national research, the University follows trend
in terms of the declining numbers of female
administrators. Three decades ago, the year
before Hutchins took over as Head Coach, nine
of the 10 women's varsity sports were coached
by women. Today, seven of 14 women's varsity

coaches are male.
Armstrong, who has played, coached and
researched at a Division I level in addition to
working with the NCAA and Olympics to pro-
mote social justice and gender equality, feels
that the administrative loophole has prevented
athletics from reaching true gender equality 42
years after Title IX passed.
"We aren't seeing the same parallel improve-
ments across the board in women's athletics,
even today,' Armstrong said. "The number
of females in managerial roles today is dis-
heartening, because that's where the effective
change stems from."
Women on the field

This concept of societal pressure is what
Armstrong refers to as "cognitive dissonance."
The idea is that to avoid being perceived as too
masculine, female athletes accentuate femi-
ninity. From fashion to speech patterns, even
the most masculine women try to assume the
same identity as everyone else.
After leaving the gymnastics team to join
the Olympic weightlifting club last year, Nagle
found that the shame of h-ing masculine only
increased. She carr'ed the identity normalv
reserved for men e r yday, and only whcn she
accepted it heself did the heavy load lighten.
"When Jt oldpeo-
ple I did ,Ightlift-
ing, I wasn l OK with
it myself.Nagk se

remember thinking 'I don't know who these
people are or what they did, and I'm creeped
out because I'm half-naked in a bank."'
The role of cheerleaders is different than any
other sport - male or female - on campus. The
team must simultaneously train to defend their
National Championship and represent the face
of the University.
"Everyone knows the uniforms and what
ceerleaders are," Niznik said. "So when
the University needs a stand-in or wants to
make their presence known they just send us,
because we have pretty faces and shiny pom

ley pointed out in 1993, male athletes don't have
to be role models. The success of male sports
continues to grow, and society will go on if
Barkley or other male athletes fail to live up to
moral or societal standards. But today, women
don't have that luxury.
"They have to be good citizens," Hutchins
said. "They have to be good students and rep-
resent the University as ambassadors. (Soft-
ball player) Sara Driesenga had to walk out of
the locker room door after pitching a loss and
giving up the winning hit and still be on her
A-game for the kids. It's important to recog-
nize that all these little girls look up to you and
want to be you."
Fair play: The future movement
Throughout history, sports have paved the
road for change in society. From uniting social
and economic classes to breaking down racial
barriers, equality on the field has often been
achieved first, with society following suit.
If Title IX were a living woman, she'd be
middle-aged. At 42, the law enforcing gender
equality between federally-funded activities
has begun to do just that.
But the law can only control so much. The
way women's athletics are perceived is far from
equal to men's. From January 2000 to June
201 L Spor tsillustrated featured women onjust
35 of their covers - roughly 4.9 percent of 716

SA Senior Shannon Niznik hasn't
brushed her hair in three days. Her face
is buried in an LSAT book, and she is
studying anonymously in the Business School's
Winter Garden. No one asks to pose for pic-
tures with her; no one asks for her autograph,
no one gawks, points or even gives a second
glance as they walk by.
In today's age, the sighting of a high-profile
male athlete can be compared to seeing a movie
star in person. Even if they aren't recognized
immediately, the University of Michigan ath-
letic apparel and the infamous blue backpack
are enough to garner at least a few hushed loks.
But for Niznik, she only causes a stir on game
days, when - asa senior member of the Michi-
gan cheerleading team -she is asked to pose
for pictures with kids, students and husbands.
"On game days we're always posing for
photos, holding babies and talking to people,"
Niznik said. "Cheerleaders are well known for
the uniform that we're wearing, but people
don't know athing aboutus. Onlyuntil recently
on the website I was just Shannon the cheer-

leader. They don't even realize we exist outside
of the uniform and pom poms, it's an identity-
less entity."
Such is life for many female athletes. Even
in the modern era, female athletes sometimes
lack the recognition and - in many cases,
respect - that male athletes receive.
Across the nation, every Division I school
has roughly the same scholarships for men and
women, facilities are equitable nationwide, and
women are given ample opportunity to com-
pete for their teams,just like men.
But the problem of gender equality in sports
remains unsolved. More than four decades
after Title IX, the push for gender equality in
sports has reached what may be the difficult
final stretch.
A legal history
When Title IX of the Education Amendment
Act was passed in 1972, the future of college
sportswas merely an afterthought. The act was
put into place to ensure that the quality of edu-

cation in America was equal for both males and
females. Doors opened for female faculty and
administrators; standardized tests were moni-
tored and altered to fairly assess to both gen-
ders equally; arts, music and theater programs
were designed to balance male and female par-
ticipation and involvement.
But as the years wore on, it became clear that
athletics would be the biggest but most contro-
versial change under the law. In the late 1970s,
female athletes began to file lawsuits, claiming
athletic departments weren't taking the law
seriously. The 1980s saw progress, but accord-
ing to Michigan Softball Coach Carol Hutchins
- who was hired as an assistant in 1983 before
taking over as head coach two years later - the
movement was far from desired equality.
"We were just a cut above intramural
sports," Hutchins said. "Title IX passed in
'72, but it wasn't being well received when I
arrived. Athletic departments recognized they
had a federal court case on their hands if they
didn't comply, so schools had women's sports,
but they weren't being supported real well."

On the field itself, female athletes still face "I thought it Was Ve

of selves with the added burden of being an inspi-
h ration as well.
n In the early days of the Title IX era, the role
of women's sports in college was simply to fill
d scholarships. Today, women's sports still fail
o to generate enough revenue to support them-
n selves, but the role female athletes play has
d changed.
"Women's athletics has always been a place
ar to show what women can accomplish in soci-
re ety," Armstrong said. "Sports has been a leader
r in empowering women, and today many girls
f- even in areas other than sports are inspired by
ig athletes, but because the athletes are success-
ie ful in a visible way.
n- "It's not about what they do in sport, but how
they navigate the gendered terrain. By doing
se well in sports, female coaches and athletes can
e show what women can do in other male-dom-
st inated areas, and that can have a tremendous
impact on society," she said.
In her 29 seasons as head coach of
the Michigan softball team, Hutchins
has never had a losing season. Unsur-
prisingly, the Michigan softball team
has more Twitter followers and
receives more media coverage than
the baseball team. Yet of all the accom-
plishments her teams have had over
the years, Hutchins knows the biggest
one is inspiring female leaders of the
future.
As NBA hall-of-famer Charles Bark-

Aecord ing to Armstrong and Hutchins, this
pattern won't last long. The two figures who
have overseen the development of women's
spoi-ts feel the recent focus on women's sports
bas had an impact on the young adults of today,
and believe itwon'tbe longbefore today'syouth
will lead society to a state of complete equality.
"(Women's sports) are still evolving,"
Hutchins said. "My father's generation couldn't
even fathom gender equality, but it's genera-
tional. People are viewing women's athletics a
heck of a lot better than they were 10, 20 years
ago. It's evolving, just like society is still evolv-
ing, but we always have to be vigilant for equali-
ty. By the nextgeneration, we'llbe pretty close."
A look inside Armstrong's "Gender and
Sport" class proves Hutchins' point. As the sun
crept over the horizon at 8:30 a.m., students
slowly filed in. Once the class began, students
engaged in lively discussions, ranging in topic
from the caliber of the NBA All-Star game to
locker room culture to Sheryl Swoope's sexual-
ity conflict and the media's portrayal of lesbian
athletes. But throughout the class, the thread of
hope remained clear.
"This generation gets it," Armstrong said.
"When I teach my classes, my students are
phenomenal. Hope is on the horizon. This gen-
eration embraces the social justice concept and
has the belief that gender equality is something
society needs, that life should be fair and rules
are there to promote fair play."
Laws are put into place to lay the foundation
for change. They can't dictate the reaction, per-
ception or acceptance of those affected by the
law. Title IX has pushed women's sports from
an afterthought to an obligation to an opportu-
nity. Now, the burden is on those involved in the
sports worldto ensure women'sathleticsgarner
