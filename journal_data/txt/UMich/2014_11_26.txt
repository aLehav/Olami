Marijuana was
decriminalized in
Ann Arbor in 1974+
By EMMA KERR and
JACK TURMAN
Daily StaffReporters
As more states and munici-
palities are voting to decrimi-
nalize recreational marijuana
use, Ann Arbor could be closer
to legalization.
The residents of six Michi-
gan cities voted to decrimi-
nalize the use of cannabis on
election day this year. Marijua-
na use is legal in some form in
23 states, and was legalized for
recreational use this Novem-
ber in Alaska and Oregon. The
states are the third and fourth
states to adopt such a policy.
LSA senior Brian Kardell,
codirector of Students for Sen-
sible Drug Policy, said his orga-
nization is working to create a
dialogue surrounding the need
for marijuana legalization.
"Our goal is basically have
open conversations about drug

use and drug abuse," Kardell
said. "We think the war on
drugs is a failed policy. It puts
hundreds of thousands of peo-
ple in prison for drug-related
offences. Ann Arbor is consid-
ered a safe place for marijuana,
but we don't condone or con-
demn drug use, we just know
the drugpolicy needs to change
on a large scale."
Kardell said his organiza-
tion's support of the legal-
ization of marijuana in the
state of Michigan stems from
observing what has happened
in other states following can-
nabis legalization, considering
the negative effects of keeping
marijuana on black markets
instead of regulating it.
"All we have to do is look to
Colorado and Washington to
see how much money the state
has made because of the legal-
ization and regulation of mari-
juana," Kardell said.
The use of marijuana has
been decriminalized in Ann
Arbor since 1974, but the pos-
sibility of legalizing the sub-
stance in Michigan could be

There were no Republicans on
the ballot during last fall's City
Council elections, but several

Democratic candidates faced a
challenge from another party.
The Mixed Use party, com-
prised mostly of University stu-
dents, ran two candidates for
seats on the council, including
then-LSA senior Conrad Brown
and Eastern Michigan University
student Sam DeVarti.
Both lost, but were followed by
several more student challeng-
ers this year - LSA sophomore,

Sam McMullen, who lost in this
year's Democratic primary, and
now, University alum Will Leaf, a
former co-chair of the Mixed Use

Amid scandal, UVA students speak

Student leaders at the Univer-

ference Monday to address media
attention that has placed the uni-
versity's sexual assault response
procedures under heightened
scrutiny, The Cavalier Daily
reported Monday.
A recent Rolling Stone article,
profiling a sexual assault survi-
vor within the school's Greek Life
community catalyzed the press
conference.
"We recognize that sexual vio-
lence is a problem in our fraterni-

the groups.
SAC Chair Patrick Musgrave
estimated that the groups request-

Panel discusses social science research

Experts talk open
data, information
sharing among
researchers
By QUAN NGUYEN
Daily StaffReporter
Emphasizing the impor-
tance of open access to data,
three University professors
discussed the future of social
science research in a panel
held in the Hatcher Graduate
Library on Thursday.
The panelists invited to
present their suggestions
included Psychology Prof.
Nick Ellis, Assistant History
Prof. Michelle McClellan and
History Prof. George Alter.
Ellis, who is also an editor
for the Language Learning
Journal, discussed the pub-
lication's negotiations with
Wiley, it's publisher, to enable
more hon-Wiley subscribers
to obtain access to research

methods and data reports of
past social science research
projects.
"Wiley is more interested in
the business model than they
are in making us open around
the world," he said. "We have
negotiations with them about
them subsidizing republica-
tion and re-issue in China and
India.Itis an interestingnego-
tiation."
Similarly, Alter concen-
trated on research trans-
parency throughout the
majority of his presentation
due to his position as the
director of the Inter-univer-
sity Consortium for Political
and Social Research. He said
promoting research transpar-
ency would resolve some of
the most frequent criticisms
directed toward research-
ers. Common problems derive
from research that is difficult
to replicate, fraudulent cases
and projects incentivized by
profit.
He said the ICPR must first
earn the trust of data produc-

ers and the public, and provide
documentation about where
and how data is created.
Alter added that even
though Congress and other
national agencies have recent-
ly expressed support for data
transparency for federally
funded projects, data restric-
tions are still an obstacle for
many researchers due to pri-
vacy concerns.
He also credited the new
form of data to the growing
forms of technology such as
Facebook, smartphones, Twit-
ter, hospitals' online archives
of patients' histories and
even credit card transactions.
Alter concluded his presenta-
tion anticipating how social
research projects will search
for new ways to strike a bal-
ance between private and open
data.
While both expressed trans-
parency as a pillar for suc-
cessful future social science
research projects, McClellan
targeted her speech toward
transparency between pro-
=fessionals of different disci-

en's Studies Prof. Beth Glover
Reed, on gender and addiction.
She specializes in alcoholism
in women.
As a veteran interdisciplin-
ary researcher, McClellan
advised the audience to "undo"
their past understandings and
avoid assumptions when team-
ing up with researchers from
other disciplines. She humor-
ously recalled how she once
mistakenly thought the testing
subjects were humans because
Becker referred to lab rats as
simply male and female.
"Not only we did not know
what we were talking about,
(but) in some way, it is even
more dangerous because we
thought we knew what we
were talking about to one
another," she said.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, McClellan
said she wants to incorporate
social science knowledge into
natural science research to
alleviate public confusion over
the results scientists present
in their findings.
"We are trying to publish
something in the scientific
journal that says trying to pay
attention to the context of how
your ideas are being under-
stood," she said.

ENDOWMENT
From Page 1A
individual donations depends on
the donor.
"For example, having just talk-
ed with development, we know
that, toward that $1 billion goal
for student support, donors have
given about $400 million so far,
so almost halfway to that goal,"
Fitzgerald said. "Most of that is
donations that are gifts that will go
into the endowment, so that they'll
be invested."
Donations outside that fundrais-
ing push may be invested directly
into specific projects, such as Uni-
versity alum Charles Munger's
$110 million donation, which allo-
cated money for the construction
of graduate student housing.
Castilla and Fitzgerald said, on
average, the University spends 4.5
percent of investment proceeds,
leavingthe rest to grow the endow-
ment.
As to why the endowment has
grown so quickly, even in just the
last year, Castilla said it's a matter
of compensating for the decrease of
public funds.
"Once upon a time, many
decades ago, the University of
Michigan was mainly funded
by the state," Castilla said. "The
composition of that funding has
changed over time. Everybody
knows that the state has cut back
on funding over time, but the cost
of giving an education has gone up
also."
The state of Michigan provides
16 percent of the University's
general fund budget, according
to University budget reports. In
comparison, it was 78 percent in
1960, so the drop has provided the
impetus for the need to expand
the endowment, raise tuition and
encourage donations.
As recently as 1990, tuition and
fees and state support provided
equal contributions to the Univer-
sity.
For this reason, expanding the
endowment has been critical for
funding all facets of the Univer-
sity. Fitzgerald said if the endow-
ment didn't grow, costs like tuition
would increase at higher rates.
Some might say the constantly
expanding endowment is a sign
that the University operates like
a private company, rather than

a non-profit, public educational
institution. Fitzgerald said the
opposite is true.
"It's really acting like a prudent
investor for the funds that have
been provided by the donors,"
Fitzgerald said. "And we want to
maximize those donor dollars to
do the most good across campus
for the educational benefit of our
students as possible."
Castilla also underlined that,
while the University has the high-
est endowment of any public insti-
tution, it's 94th on a per-student
basis.
"One thing to keep in mind,
and a lot of people don't realize,
but I think it's really important to
understand ... although the dollar
amounts seem very large, the Uni-
versity is so large that if you look
at it on a per student basis, we're
really only roughly speaking about
the 100th largest endowment in
the country," Castilla said.
The investments, Part I:
Private equity and strategies
Beyond the role and meaning of
the endowment, a quick glance at
the investment report doesn't nec-
essarily articulate how the Univer-
sity invests its money.
The firms listed in the longterm
portfolio are scattered across the
nation and globe, though many
seem to be in Palo Alto, New York
and China. Adding to this confu-
sion is that the companies are all
focused in capital, management
and equity, not typical "stocks."
That's because they're not
stocks at all. Castilla highlighted
that the University never directly
invests in individual stocks, bonds,
mutual funds and other types of
properties.
Instead, its system of invest-
ing has numerous layers, and the
easiest way to explain the format
is that the Investment Office gives
money to other firms to invest on
the University's behalf.
"What we do is we pick man-
agers in certain sectors," Castilla
said. "We give them pieces of the
endowment, and then they make
the specific investments."
"We're saying, here's some U
of M money; you invest it in these
kinds of companies that you're
really good at investing," Fitzger-
ald said. "All of these companies
that are listed in the report are
investment companies that work

candidate to succeed in a bid for
political office in the U.S. when
she was elected to a Council seat.
Preceding her in 1972 were two
other student councilmembers:
Universityalums Nancy Wechsler
and Jerry DeGrieck.
Ann Arbor attorney Tom Wie-
der, who was a University stu-
dent in 1972 and participated in
several Democratic City Council
campaigns during that time, said
there was a heightened atmo-
sphere of student involvement
locally, namely because of the
threat of being drafted.
"In '72, the Vietnam War was
still going on and student activ-
ism across the political spectrum
was a big deal," Wieder said. "On
campuses, everybody was into
politics - politics were much
higher on the list of things to get
involved in and think about, talk
about, particularly in a town like
Ann Arbor."
Mike Henry, chair of the Ann
Arbor Democratic Party, also
pointed to the war as a reason for
the spike in student involvement,
which he said contrasted with
today's climate around student
activism.
"I don't think the culture or
the things going in society are
exactly like they were in the
'70s," he said. "We were coming
off a war where a whole lot of
youngpeople died,where a whole
lot of young people were coming
back to really difficult challenges
they would have to deal with."
Kozachenko, Wechsler and
DeGrieck all ran on the Human
Rights Party ticket, a liberal and
student-focused third party that
emerged in the 1970s follow-
ing the ratification of the 26th
Amendment to the U.S Constitu-
tion in 1971, which gave 18-year-

shifting closer to reality, given
the results of the recent midterm
election.
"In town, it's very promi-
nent, mostly because it's been
decriminalized since the 70s,"
said Samantha Anderson, mem-
ber liaison at Om of Medicine, an
Ann Arbor marijuana dispensary.
"People are more open to it all
around, whether you are an adult
or you're younger because there's
just more leeway with the differ-
ent charters that the city has for
cannabis use."
Anderson said Om of Medi-
cine has 4,000 active patients, but
has a total of 6,000 patients in its
computer system. Of these 6,000
patients, Anderson said, around a
quarter are University students or
Washtenaw Community College
students.
Along with the service it pro-
vides to patients, Anderson added
that Om of Medicine has fund-
raising events for politicians and
political initiatives.
"That definitely has stirred up
alot of different pieces of legisla-
tion that's going all over the coun-
try," Anderson said. "Just the
acceptance of that is helping our

cause because if people are going
to be open to adult use, they're
definitely going to be looking
into supporting medical cannabis
too."
VIGIL
From Page 1A
went on. By the end of the night,
law enforcement reported at least
61 arrests.
Movements to address race
relations and campus climate
are not unfamiliar to the cam-
pus community. The University's
Black Student Union and the
organization By Any Means Nec-
essary have held events and pro-
tests in recent months, largely in
response to stagnant minority
enrollment at the University.
LSA junior Imani Gunn, BSU
political actions co-chair, said
the discussion of Brown's death
goes beyond issues of race.
"I think it's really important
to make people aware of the
Mike Brown decision," Gunn
said. "It is our goal to make sure
people know we are not OK with
this decision. Our voices need to
be heard, and I think if you want
to look at it as a race thing you
can, but also as a human rights

olds the right to vote.
Since then, there haven't been
students on City Council. The
Human Rights Party lost its seats'
in the following election, and
ultimately dissolved to become
a part of the Socialist Party of
Michigan several years later.
The past few years' involve-
ment, both from the Mixed Use
Party and from candidates like:
Democratic McMullen, represent
some of the first instances of stu-
dents participating in City Coun-
cil since the '70s.
Both Wieder and Henry said
they saw this resurgence in stu-
dents running as different from
the '70s, drawing less on a-nation-
al sense of political activism and
more from a group of individuals
engaged in city politics.
Leaf, the former co-chair of
the Mixed Use party and a 2015
Council candidate, agreed.
"I think the people who are
running tend to be very detail-
oriented, people who are doing
it because they're interested
in it ratier than as part of a big
national plan," he said.
Several other structural
changes have also occurred since
the '70s, which could impact how
successful student candidates are
this time around.
City Council primaries are
now held in August. Leaf said
the timing presents a challenge
when one party dominate Coun-
cil; Democrats currently hold all
but one seat. The election's true
competition thus occurs during
the primary, when many students
aren't in town.
The dividing lines of wards
are also a factor. Though they've
always been drawn out from the
city center, that division is now
more sharply distinguished, with
the city's 40,000 students - over
a third of the city's population
- scattered throughout several
wards.

Complicating matters further,
many of those students also don't
vote. During the November elec-
tions this year, Michigan Daily
reporters at the polls found that
precincts with heavy student
populations had some of the low-
est vote counts in the area.
Leaf also cited several other
institutional issues as barriers to
student voting, including the fact
that absentee voters casting their
vote for the first time in Michi-
gan must submit their ballot in
person.
"You can say whatever you
want - like, I want more student
engagement, I want involvement
- but if the election times are
August, and you have barriers to
students voting, it's not going to
happen," Leaf said.
Henry said in the current cli-
mate, a student-focused platform
wasn't a winning proposition for
local elections.
"I tell most candidates, you
can't just depend on your one
constituency to help you win,"
Henry said. "You have to speak to
everybody. And to be quite frank,
students have not been reliable in
terms of coming out."
"I hope students prove me
wrong, that in the near future
they come out and are really sup-
portive of their own demograph-
ic and their own interests ... but
students don't always do that," he
added.
Leaf said his experience with
the Mixed Use Party demon-
strated that buy-in from city
residents, not just students, is key
to a successful race. Unlike the
student-driven wins of the '70s,
for his forthcoming campaign,
he said, he would be depending
on support from across the spec-
trum.
"It's not going to be a student-
led thing," he said. "A student
might run, but they're going to
depend on other residents."

in a particular area."
Broadening the scope of this
technique, the University choos-
es from five "super strategies:"
Venture capital, private equity,
natural resources, real estate
and absolute return. Within each
strategy, the University picks
firms, or "managers," that refine
those areas of investment into
even more specific "asset classes,"
or smaller markets.
often, the larger managers will
hire smaller ones within a more
refined asset class, and this sec-
ond set of managers will finally
invest the University's original
funds in specific stocks.
The goal is for managers with
niche areas of expertise to use
their market knowledge to invest
the University's endowment in
the most efficient way possible,
yielding the highest returns with
the least risk.
overall, these allocations of
money to private equity firms
comprise the University's long
term portfolio, which makes up
a large portion of endowment
spending.
The investments, Part II:
Public equity and
internalfunding
Castillasaidthelong-termport-

folio is often seen as synonymous
with "endowment." However, he
added, a portion of the endowed
funds are invested in public mar-
kets as well. These investments
are liquid, and referred to as mar-
ketable securities.
As indicated in the investment
report, around 27.5 percent of
these marketable securities are
invested in the public stock mar-
ket. The University's top invest-
ment: $13 million in Apple, Inc.
The University has also begun
investing in itself. In November
2011, the University established
the Michigan Investment in New
Technology Startups program,
which allows the Investment
Office to invest in startups "based
on technology that was licensed
from the University of Michigan,"
according to the MINTS website.
All of the University's invest-
ments, and those who the Univer-
sity hires to invest on its behalf,
are held to the Uniform Prudent
Management of Institutional
Funds Act, passed in 2006. This
mandates that the University can
only authorize "costs that are
appropriate and reasonable" asso-
ciated with making these invest-
ments.
"We think of it as investing for
return to support the mission,
which, in the case of the Univer-
sity of Michigan, happens to be
education and research," Castilla
said.

Parameters for divestment
The University also has a set of
individual standards for divesting
funds, which Fitzgerald said are
stringent and rare in application.
"The bar is set intentionally
high ... to somewhat insulate the
investment office from the politi-
cal winds that could change from
one direction to the other," he
said. "So the bar for consider-
ing divesting. is set intentionally
very high and requires this broad
pervasive sentiment throughout
University community to even be
considered."
This consideration operates
through the Board of Regents,
Castilla said. The regents have
voted to divest twice. In 1978, the
University divested from South
Africa during apartheid and in
recent years, divested fromtobac-
co companies.
Fitzgerald added that divesting
on the sole basis of political sen-
timent would both infringe upon
the Investment Office and harm
University projects.
"If we were to shift our invest-
ments based on the political per-
spectives of this group or that
group, we'd essentially be under-
mining the performance of the
overall goal ... (to) maximize the
return so that those disburse-
ments can help pay for endowed
scholarships and the operations
of the University," Fitzgerald
said.


LSA senior Justin Gehr said
progressive students drive the
marijuana-friendly culture, but
Ann Arbor's city laws also con-
tribute to people's perceptions.
"I feel like a lot of it has to do
with some many young forward-
thinking people," he said. "I feel
like that's where the big popula-
tion of marijuana smokers are."
According to Ann Arbor's City
Charter, the penalty for possess-
ing or using marijuana is consid-
ered a civil infraction, similar to a
traffic ticket. Possessing or abus-
ing marijuana results in a fine of
$25 for the first offense, $50 for
the second offense and is capped
at $100 for a third or subsequent
offense.
Individuals who violate the city
charter because of marijuana use
or possession only have to pay the
fine. City charter says "no incar-
ceration, probation, nor shall any
other punitive or rehabilitative
measure be imposed."
However, an amendment to
the City Charter on Nov. 2, 2004
allowed fines to be waived if a per-
son has a medical identification
card recommended by a physician
or another health professional for
medical treatment.
Even with the amendment to
the charter in 2004, the Univer-
sity has different laws pertain-
ing to marijuana possession and
abuse because it is under the
jurisdiction of state laws.
"Because the University is
chartered through the state

legislature, our officers aren't
under the umbrella of the city,"
said Diane Brown, Department
of Public Safety and Security
spokeswoman. "Our officers are
granted their authority from the
state and therefore, enforce state
law."
For possession or use of mari-
juanaon University property, the
penalty is a misdemeanor, which
incurs a fine of up to $1,000 and/
or imprisonment up to one year
for a first offense.
Even though Ann Arbor's City
Charter permits the use of mari-
juana for medical treatment,
citizens and students cannot use
marijuana on campus. Because
the University receives federal
funding, the Michigan Medi-
cal Marihuana Act, which has
been in effect since 2008, does
not take precedence over federal
laws regarding marijuana use.
According to the Annual Secu-
rity Report provided by Univer-
sity police, there has been a rise
in drug arrests over the past
three years, including mari-
juana. In 2013, drug law arrests,
which are reported to University
Police, and drug law violations,
which are reported to Campus
Security Authorities, decreased
from 2012. Over the past three
years, 2012 had 134 instances of
drug law arrests, which was the
highest. In regards to drug law
violations, 2011 had the highest
number of instances at 202 over
the past three years.


PHILO
From Page 1A
on Philo. The service is available
anywhere on campus - excluding
the University of Michigan Health
System's facilities - on either a
desktop or a mobile device.
In its trial phase that began in
early November, Philo is being test-
ed on Ann Arbor's campus, free of
charge, to determine whether stu-
dents would be interested in pur-
chasing subscription plans to the
service in upcomingyears.
Philo CEO Andrew McCollum,
a Facebook co-founder and Har-
vard University alum, said he pre-
dicts Philo will be popular among
University students because the
service provides more flexibility in
how they consume television.
Universities can purchase Philo
for use on their campuses and offer
un-plugged television program-
ming to their students and faculty
members. The serviceitselfisbased
off the television subscription the
University maintains with tradi-
tional content providers. McCol-
lum said individuals not affiliated

with a subscribing institution can't
access the channels.
"The service is basically to get
more people and more students
using it because we think that
once people try it, they'll realize
it's a much better way to watch
TV, and make the University make
this (cable TV) service that they're
paying for more accessible to stu-
dents," he said.
Philo's main benefit to universi-
ties is that it doesn't require a high
bandwidth to operate - giving it
an advantage over popular con-
ventional services like Netflix and
Hulu. However, McCollum said
there are many other indirect ben-
efits from employing Philo services
on a college campus.
For instance, he said, making
Philo available to students might
minimize Internet piracy by allow-
ing users to record segments of
television programming from any
of the available channels for later
viewing.
Andy Palms, executive director
of communications systems and
data centers at the University, said
ITS realized that students want
an alternative to "plugging a cable

into a wall" because of the declin-
ing number of students who paid
for cable TVsubscriptions through
University Housing.
If all goes according to plan, the
University will offer Philo to stu-
dents on a pay-per-subscription
plan starting in Fall 2015. All Uni-
versity students, staff members
and faculty willbe able to purchase
individual subscriptions, though
the service will only be available
within the physical boundaries of
the University.
Pradip Patel, a data engineer-
ing manager at ITS, noted that the
service would pose a change to the
way cable TV is purchased in resi-
dence halls. With Philo, instead of
sharing the costs of cable network
between the two or three stu-
dents who live together in a dorm
room, individual students would
be responsible forpurchasingtheir
own television service.
Forty-eight channels are cur-
rently available on the University's
pilot service, but Patel estimates 96
being available once the final ser-
vice is offered for subscription.
Palms said ITS is not ready to
release what it will charge students.


thing. Someone deserves to be
held responsible, so I think that's
why a lot of people are finding a
personal reason to be involved in
this cause, no matter their race."
Members of the BSU also
painted the rock at the cor-
ner of Washtenaw Avenue and
Hill Street Tuesday afternoon
black with red letters reading
"Black lives matter" and "Be the
change."
LSA senior Geralyn Gaines,
BSU vice speaker, said organiz-
ers hoped to draw attention to
the Brown case.
"I think our reason for paint-
ing the rock tonight was the first
step in trying to raise awareness
around campus and how those
repercussions will effect our
day to day interactions with one
another on campus," she said.
"Looking back to the Trayvon
Martin trial, for this to hap-
pen again is really crazy at this
point."
The group later marched to
Ann Arbor City Hall, blocking
traffic on East Liberty Street.

Communitymembers in atten-
dance chanted, "Hands up, don't
shoot" and "These racists cops
have got to go." Ypsilanti resi-
dent Tony Morgan spoke to the
crowd, saying justice must come
from the people, and it is their
voices and actions only that have
the power to change institutions.
"We have to get the blood off
of our hands," he said. "We have
to understand that this is about
human rights. It's 2014, and we
still don't have equal rights. Some
of you understand that there is a
chance the system may not work
for you some day, and it's not just
the cops, because they are just
the ones on the ground. They are
doing the dirty work, but a lot of
the time, those victims look a lot
like me and you. For every Mike
Brown and Treyvon, there are a
thousand more."
Attorney General Eric Holder
has initiated a federal investi-
gation, despite the grand jury's
decision, and the Justice Depart-
ment is nearing a decision on
whether to press federal charges.

Major improvement
New minor increases diversity education on campus
B eginning in Winter 2015, University students will have the
opportunity to minor in Intergroup Relations. The new
minor takes a variety of courses already offered to students
and formalizes them into a defined program. Courses emphasize
students exploring a variety of social injustices stemming from
race, sexuality, gender, socioeconomic status and (dis)ability. The
University should be commended for expanding academics to
include studies of different identities and it should find more ways
to encourage students to take these classes.

The story about the elephant

Drew Simon told me this one
at the pachyderm exhibit
in the Denver Zoo, and I
told it to Spencer
Dodge at the edge
of a ramshackle
cemetery in
Santiago, Chile.
That's a better
place to tell it,
and where I'd tell
it to you if you
and I were there
together. Walking AVERY
through the DIUBALDO
graveyard slums
where the poor
are marked with wooden crosses,
I'd ask you if you knew the story
about the elephant, and when you'd
say "no," I'd begin like this:
So, a young American zoologist
is doing field research in Africa,
and at dusk he sees, at the bottom
of a huge yellow valley, an elephant.
This is unusual. Firstly, because,
while elephants are herd animals,
this elephant is alone; and secondly,
because this elephant is standing on
only three legs. The elephant holds
its fourth leg in the air, bending it
at the knee.
The zoologist carefully
approaches the elephant,
examining the underside of its foot,
and sees that a shard of rusty scrap
metal has been jammed into the
fleshy part of the hoof behind the
toes. He grips the metal with his
bare hands and yanks it out.
He steps back a couple of feet
and the elephant looks at him.
Not through the side of its head,
like you'd think it would, not as a
cow might look, but dead-on, like
a dog, or a person. The zoologist
looks back. They share something:
a moment.
And thenthe elephant walks away.
Years pass.
One day, while he and his family
are vacationing on the West Coast,
the zoologist goes off to a local zoo
and peeks into the elephant exhibit.
There's a little waist-high fence
and a steep concrete slope, at the
bottom of which there is, of course, an
elephant. And the zoologist thinks, I

recognize that elephant, but he doesn't
know how, or from where, and as he
walks further along the fence to get
a better look, the elephant sees him,
they lock eyes, and the elephant
raises its hoof Just like the one in
Africa.As ifitremembers him.
He figures it's just a coincidence,
so he leaves. But he returns again
the next day, and the day after that,
and the day after that. Every day, the
elephaht gives him the same signal.
one day, when the zoo is mostly
empty and nobody is watching, he.
flips his leg over the fence, slides
down the concrete slope, and walks
to the elephant.
. Theelephantraisesits foot,justlike
he thought it would, and the zoologist
puts his hand on the underside of the
hoof. The elephant looks at him, just
as before, and they have it again: this
moment, anunderstanding.
And then the elephant reaches
out with his trunk and tears off the
zoologist's head.d
And that's the end of the story.
This ending can be explained in
two ways:
The first explanation is that
the elephant in the zoo and the
elephant in the savanna are two
different elephants.
The zoologist, in a momentary
lapse of professional judgment,
has forgotten just how easy it is to
confuse one elephant for another,
and has transposed the image of
an elephant from the past onto the
image of an elephant in the present.
Perhaps a recent, unresolved
tragedy has addled his mind, sent
him reeling, and now he looks for
meaning where none exists.
And if the two elephants are the
same elephant, he reasons, then it
cannot be so by mere coincidence.
It must be, somehow, fated. In the
whirling, kaleidoscopic torment of
the universe, he and the elephant
are fixed points, two particles tied
together by some unknowable,
supernatural bond. Theirs is not a
meaningless reunion. The two of
them have met again not by chance,
but by fate - it is meant to be.
But it is not meant to be. The
elephant is the wrong elephant, the

zoologist will be killed, and the world
spins on.
The second explanation is that the
elephant in the zoo and the elephant
inthesavannaare the sameelephant.
At first, this seems impossible.
What are the odds that the
zoologist and the injured elephant
would meet again, years later, on
the other side of the earth? Or that
the elephant would even recognize
him? All elephants look the same,
we think. Why should an elephant
feel any different about us?
But what cannot be ignored is
the fact of the elephant's signal,
the raising of its foot. The odds that
any other elephant should learn
this gesture - and that this gesture
should only be made in the pres-
ence of a specific person - are so
astronomically low that one might
be led to conclude that the two ele-
phants are one and the same.
To accept this conclusion, as the
zoologist does in his final moments,
is to choose to believe that reality
is, at some fundamental level,
an ordered thing, with purpose,
meaning and a design.
of the two explanations offered
above, both are valid, but it's the sec-
ond that makes for the better story.
Storytelling (and the same can be
said for the study of history, although
I'm sure there are plenty of histori-
ans who would disagree) is the con-
version of unstructured experience
into structured narrative. In short,
meaning is discovered - or invented
- where it could not be seen before.
And so when we think of the
zoologist standing at the edge of
the enclosure, gripping the iron
fence and tensing his legs, we prefer
to imagine that he's been right all
along, that the past and future are
conjoinedby more than the sequence
of events between them, and that all
this is happening for a reason.
He stares at the elephant. The
elephant stares back. And behind
its flat black eyes is not the dumb
curiosity of a beast, but the silent
recognition of Death.

at diubaldo@umich.edu.

Students in the minor must finish between
19 and 22 credits and the program requires
two intergroup dialogue courses that empha-
size open discussions about a variety of topics.
Students fill out their identifications for race,
sexuality, (dis)ability, socioeconomic status and
gender prior to receiving an override for cours-
es. Then, applicants are sorted into groups on a
specific topic to allow for diverse backgrounds
in each space. Providing these courses helps
students tackle tough conversations about
diversity issues that are pertinent to the Uni-
versity. Students can become more aware of
oppression, gain communication skills among
those of different backgrounds and learn the
fundamentals for exploring these conversa-
tions outside of the classroom.
After enrolling in the intergroup dialogues,
students choose one of two tracks: facilitating
or research. Facilitating teaches students
to lead similar conversations in a group
setting, and research seeks to explore and
provide information on different prejudices.
Either pathway leads students to recognize
and challenge issues of oppression through
a medium relevant to their future career.
Without the minor, it may not be feasible for
students to thke'so many classes to develop
these skills. However, formalizing these
classes into a program allows students to
engage with relevant topics while receiving a

certification that demonstrates their strength
in dealing with these issues.
With the positive experiences that can come
from enrolling in these classes, the University
should work to expand these courses. First,
the University could allow relevant majors to
accept these dialogues as cognates, so more
students would be able to fit these courses into
their schedule. Second, with the creation of this
minor, the University should create an initiative
to raise awareness for these courses. Many stu-
dents may not know about these classes simply
because theyaren't heavily promoted, and their
successes could grow with increased atten-
tion. Third, work should be done to separate
students by level of knowledge on a subject.
While those of a minority or underrepresented
group will naturally be more familiar with cer-
tain concepts, work should be done to ensure
the room isn't an even divide of informed and
uninformed participants. Rather, people's.
knowledge of a topic should be on a spectrum
to maximize the best possible education.
Providing students a formalized education
in these social injustice issues shows strides
by the University to spread awareness about
prejudice. However, this is only the first step.
While students are expandingtheirknowledge
of diversity, the University must work to find
additional ways to expand diversity on this
campus.

Rules to live by

BAMN's betrayal of sexual assault survivors

6
6

ast week, affirmative action group
By Any Means Necessary shut down
what's usually a humdrum monthly
Board of Regents meeting
and pressured administra-
tors to flee behind campus
police escorts.
It was an unruly outburst
even by the group's spirited
standards. BAMN had want-
ed to pack this last meeting;
specifically, by mobilizing
activists passionate about YARDAIN
ending rampant sexual AMRON
assault on campus.
So two weeks prior to
the meeting, Kate Stenvig,
a BAMN lead organizer, attended the Sexual
Assault Prevention and Awareness Center 28th
Annual Speak Out along with 300 other peo-
ple. The space had been pre-declared safe and
confidential for survivors of sexual violence to
share their personal, traumatic stories.
Stenvig spoke briefly about her personal
experience dealingwithsexualabuse,and mostly
about BAMN. She appealed to the audience to
join her group in protest at the upcoming regents
meeting. At the end of the event, a second BAMN
member positioned at the door, flyered the
exitingattendeeswith BAMN materials.
The promotional move irked many, but
would have remained a small blip in what oth-
erwise was a powerful night for victims - if not
for what BAMN did next.
In an open letter SAPAC published Monday in
The Michigan Daily, the activist group claimed
BAMN members had been speaking in class-
rooms "retelling stories shared at Speak Out
without the consent or knowledge of survivors."
If true, this would be an egregious viola-
tion for multiple reasons. First off, for many
victims of sexual assault, their stories are the
one power they can still claim over their rap-
ists, who have already violated their bodies.
For another, you never know who's listening;
whether the rapist himself, or his friend who
knows the story is in the room.
If you still don't see why this is a big deal, it
might be as helpful to you as it was to me, to
read the first few graphs of the Rolling Stone
piece about rape at University of Virginia
(warning: extreme trigger warning).
I interviewed Stenvig and asked her if
SAPAC's allegations that BAMN had violated
anyone's privacy or confidentiality were true.
" ... Completely false," she said. "We have
never used anyone's name or specific story."
A part of me was skeptical, so I tracked
down students who were in those classrooms
and a different story quickly emerged. LSA

senior Sarah Goomar, a SAPAC member,
wrote to me that two male BAMN members
gave a presentation in her International
Studies 401 class and "one of the men retold
a story shared at SAPAC's Speak Out." In a
separate interview, LSA senior Lydia Lopez, a
classmate of Goomar's, corroborated the story.
Lopez is unaffiliated with SAPAC and did not
attend the Speak Out, but recalled that two
men, one of whom "was talking about how he
went to the Speak Out and one of the survivors
said X, Y and Z."
In a separate art history class, LSA senior
Bianca Wilson, a SAPAC member, wrote to me
that BAMN members used a couple of examples
from the speak out to both talk about the
outrageous way the University handles sexual
assault and incite students to help them "pack
the regents meeting." Wilson also sent me a
photo she snapped of the presenters, and I've
confirmed one of the faces as Stenvig.
At this pivotal moment, with sexual assault
and racial diversity finally in the spotlight, I
cannot reiterate enough just how unfortunate
this situation is. We need groups like SAPAC
and BAMN fighting for these issues, but we
need them doing it thoughtfully. BAMN's tac-
tics were uneducated, insensitive, and hurtful.
And it makes sense: the group only this year
added sexual assault prevention to their list
of demands. Historically, their focus has been
almost exclusively onminority enrollment.
Stenvig and BAMN may have had good inten-
tions. But in the end, intentions matter little next
to results. And at this moment, the result is that
survivorsfeelbetrayedbyBAMN. Insteadofsup-
port, BAMN knowingly or unknowingly tried to
incite passion using pain that they have no right
to and that they clearly don't understand. In an
attempt to push an agenda and fix an institutional
pandemic, BAMN forgot the most fundamental
piece of the reality: the human beings. You can't
fix a problem by disrespecting the very people
whose problem you say you're trying to fix.
Stenvig had multiple opportunities to admit
her and BAMN's error, and to apologize to the
survivors whose stories the group co-opted.
Unfortunately, the most she could muster
was "I have no problem apologizing if I've hurt
someone, butI don't think that's the case."
If you are a survivor of sexual assault that
spoke at the Speak Out and feel hurt by BAMN's
actions, Iask that you help me convince Stenvig
and BAMN of the damage they've done. Send
me your feelings, and Iwill pass them along. An
apology can't take back the betrayal, but it's a
better first step than pervasive hatred.

Don't ring, text.
I hovered my hand above the
doorbell, poised to ring it. As my
fingers stretched, approaching the
button, I remembered the pact we'd
made. I quickly adjusted my motion,
sliding my hand into my pocket
to pull out my Blackberry. A few
seconds later my phone vibrated in
response, affirmation that my friend
was coming to get me. She slowly
creaked open the front door of her
house and ushered me inside. We
crept upstairs, anxious to begin our
sleepover. When we finally entered
the privacy of her room, we breathed
a collective sigh of relief and grinned
at the heist we had just pulled.
Get out before her dad wakes up.
The next morning, sunlight
spilling through the windows
reminded me of our agreement. I
crept downstairs and out the front
door, dialing my mom's phone
number. Embarrassed about the
real reason for my early departure,
I would tell her half-truths about
why I had to be picked up at 8
a.m. on Saturday mornings. "I
just wake up so much earlier than
my friends and I don't want to sit
around and be bored." In reality,
this arrangement was the result of a
humiliating conversation. "My dad
is racist," she apologized. "He just
doesn't want me hanging out with
you."
When faced with racist comments,
don't show your hurt or anger. People
won't take you seriously.
Though I would like to say that I
grew up with a strong sense of self
and pride in my people, I was taught
the difference between white and
wrong at a very young age. I learned
not to get in the water at pool
parties, so I could keep my stiff
hair hidden under the heat of my
flat iron. I learned to research and
memorize the lyrics of John Mayer
and The Red Hot Chili Peppers so I
could appear knowledgeable about
the "acceptable" music preferences.
I learned that "for a black girl" was a
necessaryqualifier for compliments

that passed my way. Pretty for a
black girl. Smart for a black girl.
Articulate for a black girl. Little by
little, I was socialized to believe in
a shameful "truth," that Black is an
inherently negative descriptor. An
ugliness I would need to overcome
to be respected, valued, worthy.
So Istarted to compensate. Ibegan
to distill the things that I wanted
to do into the things I was allowed
to do, given my Blackness and how
I thought others would perceive
me. As I had more experiences
with racism my filter became more
refined, and I added new constraints
to my growing list.
When faced with a difficult class in
college, never, ever drop it. Especially
when you are the only Black person
in the class. You don't want to give
credence to the belief that you were
accepted solely because of your race
and you can't handle the challenge.
When applying for a job, remove
any race-related organization from
your resume that a white person could
read as radical or self-serving. Black
Volunteer Network may stay, but the
Women of Color Collective must go.
When cat-called or harassed
on the street; just say nothing and
keep your head down. You don't
want to be seen as the scary, angry
Black woman.
When going out with your Black
friends don't walk together ina large
group. Make sure there are several
feet between every pair of people so
others don't feel threatened.
When an officer of the law asks to
see your license, "accidentally" hand
them your school ID first, so they
know you are getting an education
and will treat you better.
When shopping, always carry the
items you are considering purchasing
far away from your body, so salespeo-
ple won't think you might steal them
and have you arrested, or worse.
My whole life I have been indoc-
trinated into playing by the rules.
I truly believed that as long as we
all mastered living within the arbi-
trary boundaries of what a Black

person "could" be, we would be
protected because of it. But that
just isn't true. These white lies
just try to hide the fact that under
white lies one thing: fear for white
lives. But instead of challenging
this pervasive, irrational reaction,
we systematically assuage it at the
expense of my people. I saw this in
President Obama's speech after the
Fergusonverdict, whenhe said "the
law feels as if it's been applied in a
discriminatory fashion, but I don't
think that's the norm." I saw it in
the words of the St. Louis County
Executive, as he pleaded for people
to "think with their heads and not
their emotions." Both men trying
to restore a narrative in which the
predictable, state-supported mur-
der of Blacks isn't a big deal. I see it
right here, in this article, knowing
that the way in which I have cho-
sen to write will make me eligible
for compassion and understanding
from white readers that I wouldn't
have been privy to otherwise.
Whenever talking about how
you've been impacted by with racism,
only share the most overt, irrefutable
examples so you will be seen as
logical instead of over-sensitive.
Explain racial oppression through an
unemotional lens so white people will
take notice and care.
You may think I'm a hypocrite,
but within that tension is the
only place my Black experience is
allowed to exist. Wanting to show
that there many different ways to
be Black, but knowing society will
only reward and accept me for one
of them. Trying to live in America
like the rules don't apply, but also
trying to just live. Waiting outside
in the darkness for her message that
will finally tell me I am welcome to
come in.

Hip Hop Congress

TV REVIEW
'Grey's' heart is still
beating after 11 seasons

Student organization
explores all facets
of the genre
By CAROLINE FILIPS
DailyArts Writer
At the intersection of hip
hop and social action lies
the University's Hip Hop
Congress, an organization
focusing on the sociocultural,
political and artistic impacts.
of hip-hop culture. Since
the national organization
reestablished its chapter on
campus in 2010 after a two-
year hiatus brought on by a
decline in. membership, the
congress has continued to
boast a strong following and
promote positivity.
As a good kid in this
m.A.A.d city himself, LSA
senior Joe Hermann serves as
the organization's president.
Often drawing inspiration
from his favorite rappers
such as Kendrick Lamar and
their tales of triumph against
gang violence and drug use,
Hermann believes there is
an empathetic aspect of the
congress' namesake genre.
"That's what I think has
stuck with me most about hip
hop, opening me up to how
people are more products of
social conditions than they
are necessarily poor choices,"
Hermann said. "I just gained
greater empathy for people of
all backgrounds because of
hip hop."
This empathy and
acceptance drawn from hip
hop fuels the organization's
positive impact across
campus. With 30-40 active
members, the congress is
a diverse group, yet all are
bound together by their love
of the music.
"When we have our
meetings and we're talking
about a new album, so
many people from different
backgrounds think it's dope
and they can all relate to
it in different ways and for
different reasons," Hermann
said. "I think that's one
thing I really appreciate
about our organization, how
it draws together people
from different backgrounds
to have conversations about

something they love."
Meetings are really
in-depth discussions, with
topics ranging from Kanye's
latest shenanigans to the
prejudices stemming from
the hip-hop stereotypes. The
congress serves to explore
issues of race, class and the
prison-industrial complex,
all while striving to uphold.
the positive aspects of hip-
hop culture's history and
significance.
"We'll watch one or two
music videos, we'll talk about
what we thought about it. I
usually try to bring one or
two topics of relevant hip
hop news," Hermann said.
"There's a real sense of
community and we just try
to have good discussions and
try and.create a little bit too
while we're there."
Along with dropping
beats (the organization is
currently in the process
of creating a mixtape), the
congress attempts to educate
its followers on the roots of
hip-hop culture's negative
connotations.
"A lot of hip hop is very
misogynistic and that comes
out of other conditions, you
know,'what are the social
conditions that produce
misogyny?' and often times
its poverty, lack of access to
equitable housing, lack of
access to jobs, poor education,"
Hermann said. "So when I
think about music that has
those negative qualities, I don't
blame the artist, but I blame
the social conditions that it
comes out of."
Due to the equal focus on
arts and social justice, the
group includes an eclectic mix
of mebers - complete with
aspiring rappers, clothing
designers and writers.
"People are both extremely
knowledgeable about politics
and social conditions, but
they're also extremely creative,
so they're thinking of creative
ways to approach problems,"
Hermann said.
The creative minded
organization hosts annual
events, often boasting
noteworthy speakers. During
last fall's presentation by Kanye
West affiliate, Rhymefest, the
rapper spoke of his Chicago-
based poetry workshop

collaboration with West,
designed to stem youth violence
and foster greater political
tparticipation. During the second
half of the year, the congress
hosted an Immortal Technique
concert at the Michigan Union.
The group also worksto falsify
unfavorable reputations of gang
culture in various cities such as
Detroit and Pittsburgh, with the
help of guest hip-hop activists
Piper Carter and rapper GsiriX,
each from the aforementioned
cities, respectively.
Events usually attract a
crowd of about 200 and aim to
encourage a stronger following
of the University chapter. In
terms of localizing the breadth
of the national organization,
Hermann believes in the
preservation of the national
organization's ideals regarding
respect and political activism
and connecting these to local
issues.
"For example, last year we
did an event called Hip Hop
Made Me Do It, which was
held at Rackham and sort of
around the time BBUM was
happening, we tried to gather
students and local leaders
to talk about the actual
issues related to race on our
campus and in the Ann Arbor
community," Hermann said.
"We tried to take the tradition
and spirit of the national
organization and apply it to
local issues, and also just show
love to local hip hop artists."
In accordance with the
goals of their predecessor rap-
icons, the congress strives
to eradicate the common
misconception that hip hop
and social justice are mutually
exclusive. Hermann is hopeful
that the group will continue to
showcase collections of music
that are neither misogynistic
nor violent.
"Talib Kweli, Mos Def,
Kendrick Lamar ... there's
all sorts of rappers who are
making music that has a
positive message as well and
are aware of the platform
that they're on as pop culture
figures," Hermann said. "I
like that our organization
has been able to facilitate
meaningful conversations and
left an impact on people where
they're legitimately pursuing
things that aren't necessarily
hip hop related."

Mid-season finale
prepares viewers
for saga's end
By SOPHIA KAUFMAN
Daily Arts Writer
The "Grey's Anatomy" mid-
season finale, "Risk," premiered
Nov. 21. While the episode was
slightly less
dramatic B
than fans Grey's
have grown
accustomed Anatomy
to, leaving Season Eleven
only two real Mid-Season
cliffhangers
instead of Finale
the usual Thursdays at 8 p.m.
five or six, it ABC
was no less
satisfying. The weaker parts
of the episode - including the
fact that its goal seemed to be to
force the break up of every single
couple - were compensated for
by the last two minutes, which
forcefully reminded audiences of
what this show can be like at its
strongest, and what makes it so
addictingly heartbreaking without
compromising the integrity of its
characters.
Fans of "Grey's Anatomy"
entered this season skeptical,
wondering if the long-running
drama could maintain its
momentum for yet another
season - and one without Cristina
(Sandra Oh, "Sideways"), one of
the show's central characters
since the beginning. The season
feels slightly drawn out, but while
Cristina's absence has been sorely
felt - especially within Meredith
(EllenPompeo, "Life oftheParty")
and Derek's (Patrick Dempsey,
"Enchanted") relationship,
in which Cristina had been a
fundamentalthirdparty, the show
surprisinglyfunctionswithouther.
One of the plot drivers of this
episode - the reveal that Jackson
Avery (Jesse Williams, "The
Cabin in the Woods") and April

ASC

'Yes, that's ritht, we're all actsally docsrs."

Kepner's (Sarah Drew, "Moms'
Night Out") baby possibly has
fatal complications - adds
unneeded drama to a storyline
that's already interesting enough:
seeing if their relationship can
survive the trials of caring for a
newborn on top of the problems
already posed by their different
views on religion. The fact that
Jackson's ex-girlfriend diagnoses
these complications isn't ironic or
a source of comic relief, but just
uncomfortable.
Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez,
"Chicago") and Arizona Robbins
(Jessica Capshaw, "Minority
Report") finally have a scene
together without one of them
ending up in a rage; the lack of
jaw-dropping drama in favor of
unobtrusive displays of quiet
emotion is a welcome change and
gives the audience a moment to
breathe. Justin Chambers ("The
Wedding Planner") continues to
give a stellar performance as Alex
Karev, the original black sheep of
the family who is finally coming
into his own as a mature adult. The
scenes in which he bluntly gives
Meredith and Arizona the advice
they need subtly hint that he's
readytotake over as the flawedyet
true moral compass of the group.
Of course, the show's most
dynamic couple continues to be
Meredith and Derek, who seem
to be heading towards their
deepest divideyet. In the finale,
Meredith's newfound half-sister
Maggie (Kelly McCreary, "Being
Flynn") acts as a catalyst for the

couple to fight until they reach a
breaking point. The final - and
by far the best - scene of the
episode is between the two of
them and features some of writer
Shonda Rhimes's most impressive
work. Derek makes a phone call
accepting a job offer that will
take him away from his family,
never breaking eye contact with
Meredith. She tells him to go,
and go now, her current reality of
watching Derek walk away from
her blended with dim childhood
flashbacks of watching her own
mother call after the love of her
life. Derek and Meredith's pain is
palpable without being pushy. It's
impossible to watch them arguing
without remembering where
they came from and what they've
been through, and both- Pompeo
and Dempsey bring nuances to
their performances that remind
audiences of how much they've
grown and fleshed out their
characters overthe years.
The way that season 11 is going
so far, every poignant scene holds
elements reminiscent of years
past; the last seconds of the finale
do so overtly, featuring a chilling
montage of the most poignant
turning points of Meredith's
life in Seattle. This collection of
snippets from every season, more
than anything else in the episode,
reminds the audience, of what
"Grey's" used to be and could
return to, while 1 to eeming to
gently prepare the audience for
the inevitable close of this long-
runningsaga.

The lasting legacy of The
Nightmare Before Christmas'

Students should support
student art, shows at 'U'

By REBECCA GODWIN
DailyArts Writer
This past weekend, I had
the opportunity to see an
entirely student-created piece
of theatre. Skylar Tarnas, a
sophomore in the Residential
College, wrote the show,
entitled "Breaking News,"
and it was produced and
performed by the RC Players.
It was tremendous, in terms
of acting and writing, and
the message the audience
was left with was incredibly
powerful. But as I was sitting
in the audience, what struck
me most was the fact that
everything I was seeing was
created by students. The
words were written by a
student, the play was directed
by a student, even the set was
made by students.
Of course Tarnas isn't
the only student on campus
creating top-notch original
art. Throughout the
University, individuals are
creating new works all the
time, in dance, photography,
music, painting or poetry.
And as fellow students, it's
our job to support them.
University sponsored
events receive the best
publicity, the best venues and
usually the largest audiences.

Student-created art isn't
usually that lucky, often
debuting wherever they can
find space, whether that's in
empty classrooms or a rented
conference room. That's why
it's so important to attend as
many events as possible, not
only to support the student
artists, but also simply to
absorb as much original work
as you can.
You'll never be in a place
where so much new art is
being made so frequently
and is so easily accessible
ever again. Just this last
weekend, students had the
ability to see a play, an a
cappella concert, a musical,
a quirky percussion group
and an orchestra perform,
all of which were made up
of, run by and performed
by students. Access to all of
these events was either free
or significantly discounted
for students.
The level of variety
and abundance of art
events wasn't a one-time
coincidence: every weekend
there are just as many,
sometimes even more, student
art events happening. To not
take advantage of as many as
possible would just be a waste
of amazing resources. But by
attending student art events,

you're not only increasing
your own appreciation of
various art mediums, you're
also encouraging student
artists to keep creating, to
keep experimenting and to
keep inspiring. Eventually
these student artists will
leave the University, and
they may go on to become
critically-acclaimed artists in
whichever field they choose,
but their start will always be
at Michigan, and you can say
you were a part of it.
Wherever your interests lie
in the arts, there are students
producing new pieces in that
field. If you're a fan of comedy,
check out Comco or any of the
other student improv groups
on campus. If you like theatre,
the RC Players and Basement
Arts put on various original
student pieces throughout
the year. If you're really into
a cappella, there are dozens
of groups to choose from,
including the very popular
G-Men. And if full orchestra
performances are your thing,
then you may want to go see
a Michigan Pops concert. But
don't get overwhelmed by all
the choices, because it doesn't
really matter what you go
and see as long as you see
something. Just get out and
support student art.

With October done and gone,
November dreary as ever and
December waiting with its handful
of frost just around the corner, we
have entered into the period at
the end of the year when holiday
spirit changes from. frightful to
plentiful to delightful in a matter
of weeks. While for many people
this excitement evokes a festive
cheer, for some it delivers a keen
melancholy, a ghoulish sadness
exacerbated by the weather,
the shortened days, a falsity of
spirit or recognition of missed
opportunitiesthroughouttheyear.
The holidays have this kind of
polarizingeffect.
For me, one movie has
always captured the whole
spectrum of holiday emotion.
Tim Burton's "The Nightmare
Before Christmas" touches on
everything from fear to elation
to confusion, and it does so with
wonderful inagination. It's a film
of stark originality and creation
- irreplaceable by any standard.
The darkness of its storylends the
whole project a necessaryrealism,
which, takenin effect, mirrorsthe
little windows of sobering reality
we glance through betweenbouts
of holiday folly and festivity.
In his 1993 feature about "The
Nightmare Before Christmas,"
Blaise Simpson described Burton
as a lonely child who would often
look to the holidays as escape.
As Burton recalled in their
discussion, "Anytime there was
Christmas or Halloween ... it was
great. It gave you some sort of
texture all of a sudden that wasn't
there before."
After completing "Vincent"
in 1982, Burton drew from
such holiday-film inspiration
as "Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer" and "How the Grinch

DISNEY

The Grinch's skinny, crackhead cousin.
Stole Christmas!" to write a
three-page poem called "The
Nightmare Before Christmas."
As new ideas came to him, he,
would add to or adjust the poem.
Eventually, with the help of craft-
genius Rick Heinrichs, he started
to storyboard and tinker with
concept art. He and Heinrichs
went to director Henry Selick,
also a famous animator, to gauge
studio interest. ThoughSelick was
impressed, the project stalled.
According to Pat H. Broeske
in her 1991 piece "Dusting Off
Burton,""'The Nightmare Before
Christmas' wasoriginallydeemed
'too weird' and put on the back
burner by the studio." So in 1984,
Burton left the project alone.
In the years following, Burton's
offbeat, slightly macabre style
became enormously popular. As
he added part of the "Batman"
series, "Beetlejuice" and "Edward
Scissorhands" to his repertoire,
the movie-going public had
developed a strong affinity for
his bizarre and creative visions.
In 1990, Burton returned to
Disney and was given the rights
to produce a full-length feature
version of "The Nightmare Before
Christmas" along with Selick as

director. They began production
in the summer of 1991. It would
take them two full years to
complete.
Over 120 workers used 20
different stages to create the
accurate stop-motion filming.
They used 227 unique puppet
characters to capture a total of
109,440 frames. Composer Danny
Elfman penned and scored 10
original songs. The film grossed
more than 4.5 times the original
$18 million budget.The numbers
are staggering, the results more
staggeringstill.
"The Nightmare Before
Christmas" takes viewers to a
familiar but indistinct part of
their imagination, and like a
dream they've had throughout
their lives without really knowing
what it meant or what happened,
they wander through the spectral
territory in a wash of perplexity
andawe.Everydetailisthoroughly
imagined, every nook and every
crevice holds a rightful place, and
if all the scenery and shadowy
portraits of a not-so-scary
nightmare point to one thing, it
would be this: that sometimes,
dwelling in the spooky, fantastical
parts of our mind isn't allthat bad.

'Scandal' mid-

as well as the members of her

Fitz's nail-biting run for reelection
and introduced his wife, Mellie

Pope; season three brought Olivia's
powerful father, Rowan Pope
(Joe Morton, "The Good Wife"),
into the picture when he revealed
incriminating war details involving
Fitz, adding to the leaked details of
the President's relationship with
Olivia. The third season concluded
with Olivia following her father's

to Spotify as a "grand
experiment" that she wishes
to distance herself and her
music from, Swift garnered
waves of criticism. Her
decampment was stunningly
abrupt, especially following
her achievement of the most
successful album release of
2014. Critics lambasted her
for being condescending and
ignorant. But her reasoning is
not without merit, nor is Swift
alone in her rebellion.
In one short decade, from
2003 to 2013, the way in which
we buy and circulate music
has changed immensely. In
2003, the music industry
made 94.8% of its $15 billion
revenue from compact disc
sales. Ten years later this same
industry's annual revenue has
been reduced to $7 billion and
is split fairly evenly between
compact discs, digital
downloads and subscription
or streaming services.
Pandora, Rhapsody
and Spotify remain top
contenders for music
streaming subscriptions, and
all have publicly defended
themselves throughout this
global discussion. They
argue for their legitimacy
based on their promise of
monetary compensation for
artists. Spotify released a
statement following Swift's
exit, pointing out that they
"already paid more than $2
billion in royalties to the music
industry" and "if that money
is not flowing to the creative
community in a timely and
transparent way, that's a big
problem." Many have found
flaws in the new music system
Spotify provides: stars as big
as David Byrne and Jason
Aldean have spoken out
against Spotify as an entity
working to cheapen the music
industry. Thom Yorke and his
Radiohead producer, Nigel
Godrich, similarly decided to
pull their newest albums from
Spotify. In his explanation of
the band's decision, Godrich
described their actions
as a "small, meaningless
rebellion" against a system
that is so wretchedly myopic,
especially for new music.
Slowly suffocating the ebb
and flow of the creative music
industryr this "big problem"
undoubtedly exists.
All of these stars have valid
complaints against streaming
services. Putsimply, streaming
subscriptions are organized
so that artists receive a
monetary compensation that
is equated to the amount their
song is actually streamed
by listeners of the website.
The $2 billion dollars that
Spotify pays in royalties is
divided up by the percentage
of total streams. This lets the
big labels disproportionately
benefit from this system. With
older and more extensive

back catalogs, a 40-year-old
record like The Doors' "Light
My Fire" will earn the same
amount of money or more
for their record label than a
track by a new artist like King
Krule and his "The Noose
of Jah City." In a worst-case
scenario, the larger labels
with their massive catalogs
are guaranteed a far more
substantial portion of Spotify
or Pandora's promised artist
royalities while the smaller
labels and up-and-coming
artists struggle to produce
streams.
This issue was brought to
the forefront most recently
by the 1990's alternative
rock band Galaxie 500.
Drummer Damon Krukowski
and bassist Naomi Young
publicly addressed the
looming issue in a Pitchfork
article published in late 2012.
Krukowski explained and
provided specific numerical
information about the little
money they received in the
first quarter of 2012 for the
online streaming of one
of the band's biggest hits,
"Tugboat." The song was
played a total of 7,800 times
from January to March of
2012 on Pandora, and as a
result earned the band a total
of 21 cents. And on Spotify,
the song earned $1.50 in the
first quarter of 2012, which is
then divided up into 35 cents
per songwriter.
Other artists like Foo
Fighter's Dave Grohl have
taken more blas positions
in the fight against music
streaming sites. In answering
recent questions by Digital
Spy, Grohl gave his expletive-
adorned opinion, stating "You
want people to fucking listen
to your music? Give them
your music, and then go play a
show. They like hearing your
music? They'll go see a show.
To me it's that simple, and
I think it used to work that
way." Grohl is right: you love
the music and you buy tickets
to the show. But the Internet
cannot be ignored, nor can
the paralyzing ubiquity of
piracy. Grohl's response was
more correct when Nirvana
was still around.
The answer, in my opinion,
lies in a redistribution of
the royalties given out by
the streaming services. If
more money were given
to newer artists, there
would be less difficulty in
funding record production,
merchandising and touring
of new and upcoming artists.
The benefits between music
streaming sites and the artist
will be unshared, but this
change is not only necessary,
it's moral. Until these
changes arrive, the world will
be experiencing a little less
of that sappy, heartbreak-
helping Taylor Swift music.

Friends don't let friends make fools of themselves.
Friendship inf ilm

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Editor
NEW YORK - Villanova
attacked, and Michigan
countered.
Then MICHIGAN 55
Michigan VILLANOVA 60
attacked,
and Villanova countered. With
30 seconds left, they found
themselves in a one-point game,
and it wasn't clear which attack
came first.
But it was Villanova's that
came last - a stone-cold block
of sophomore forward Zak Irvin
at the rim with four seconds left
to help lead the Wildcats to a
60-55 win in the Legends Classic
championship game Monday
night.
Villanova took its first lead
in more than 10 minutes with
forward JayVaughn Pinkston's
dunk with 1:09 to play, but
Michigan had an answer when
junior guard Caris LeVert drove
for a layup with 50 seconds left.
The Wildcats retook the lead
with Pinkston's jumper with 13
seconds to go. And then it came
down to Michigan junior guard
Cn-r ^lhr-'+ nn-th+haQP1-n

with 7.8 seconds to play
Albrecht found Irvin wide
open under the basket, but
Pinkston rose up and blocked
him.
"They had three or four of
those rim-protecting type of
plays today, three big blocks
where I think we had really
good leverage," said Michigan
coach John Beilein. "We had the
basket,buttheir guys came out of
nowhere to take it away from us."
Villanova guard Ryan
Arcidiacono hit two free throws
with four seconds left, and
Michigan senior forward Max
Bielfeldt overthrew the ensuing
inbounds pass to allow the
Wildcats to ice the game.
Early in the second half,
nothing came easily for
Michigan. First, it got trapped in
the corner with 17:25 left, so the
Wolverines called timeout. Then,
freshman forward Kameron
Chatman couldn't get the ball
in, so Michigan called timeout
again. And even then, it almost.
turned the ball over, as Villanova
tipped the inbounds pass out of
bounds.
"When it was 33-20 - actually,
at +t -a nd o 'bP irm hlf -

sensed at that time we had doubts
whether we could win the game,"
Beilein said. "I'm really proud of
how their spirit changed."
Michigan's big men - usually
either Bielfeldt, redshirt
freshman Mark Donnal or
freshman Ricky Doyle - gave
away five of its seven first-half
turnovers. Sophomore guards
Derrick Walton Jr. and Zak
Irvin had trouble shooting early
on, going a combined 2-for-li
before the break. "In the first
half, they really did a good job
defensively, getting into us a
little bit and trying to take us
out of what we wanted to do,"
Albrecht said. "But at halftime,
we made some adjustments,
and I thought we were running
the offense really good in the
second half."
After LeVerthit two 3-pointers
in a one-minute span, Michigan
led, 20-18, with seven minutes
left in the first half. Those would
be the last points it would get
before the break.
All that mattered, though,
were the last points of the second
half. Those went to Villanova.
And for the first time all night,

There's much to
learn about bonding
in 'Frances Ha'
ByANDREW MCCLURE
Daily Arts Writer
It's that wave of warmth that
washes over you when you spot
them unexpectedly. Or that smile
you can't refuse as your front
teeth peelback the curtain ofyour
lips.-It's friends, man.
As our clickbait generation
bungles through isn't-there-an-
app-for-this Xerox printers and
boss subservience during our
"yo-pro" years, the one thing we
shouldn't discard is having good,
bulletproof friendships. Longtime
SNL stalwart Ana Gasteyer surely
putitbest:A friendissomeoneyou
can be weird with. And that's why
Noah Baumbach's "Frances Ha" is
the best, most realized friendship
movie in the better part of three
decades. (Because digging back
further would make me an
anachronistic, boomer-thinking
hipster, right kids?)
But let's first pay homage to a
couple predecessors that also got
it right.
Based on a novella by Stephen
King, Rob Reiner's 1986 "Stand
by Me" likely didn't jar audiences
then as it does me now. What
seems so (pathetically) foreign
to me is the sheer amount of
touching, of rough-housing, that
goes on between the little punks
onscreen. There's overwhelming
science contending that touching
another person accelerates
and amplifies bond-building. I
couldn't help but recall, back in
middle school, my best buddy's
big bro blowing a gasket when,
unbeknownst to me, my leg

touched his for, like, five seconds
uninterrupted. That's the culture
we live in now - one that claims
"Siri wouldn't ever touch my
leg!" And that's why this film
packs a huge punch. Just four
dusty denim-wearing explorer-
boys searching for a dead body,
peregrinating across deep wood,
prairie and stream. No Google
Maps, just a clean haircut and
unabashed brotherly love. It
makes me wish I used my bike
more and not that fucking Razor
scooter.
I hope everyone currently
has a friend whom they, at some
earlier time, hated. Be it their
cooler clothes, cooler mom, or
their inexplicable magnetism for
the other sex, you wanted them
deleted. Maybe from a distance,
maybe in a confrontation. No
film better portrayed this envy-
turned-enchantment than Pixar's
1995 "Toy Story." Woody and Buzz
were engineered to be homies:
both possessed demonstrable
leadership traits and killed the
ladies with a scything wit. In the
beginning, though, they're both
at fault: Woody is a human who
feels emotions like jealousy, and
Buzz is the outsider with inchoate
emotional IQ. That these two
ultimately link together teaches
us that friendship can arise from
disharmony, as long as you look
up from the screen in time to see
the potential. It makes me want
to tell strangers that I actually
sleep with a stuffed Boo from
"Monsters Inc." Every night.
I could go on and engross you
in my musings on "Wizard of Oz,"
"Mean Girls" and "The Trip" but,
at the end of the day, this isn't
some genteel New Yorker piece
people pretend to have read. Let's
get to the main event, then.
Our leading lady, a poor and

open-book dancer named Frances
(played with bravura by Greta
Gerwig, "Greenberg") is not a real
dancer. She hesitates to tell others
she dances for a living, "because
I don't really do it." She is the
11th man on a dance company
whose impresario has no room
for naive, little Frances - who,
by the way, is well into her mid-
twenties. There is, however, one
thing that buoys her from the
heavyweights of pennilessness
and dancing dreams quashed:
Sophie, her best friend (played
with enviable charm by Mickey
Sumner, "Girl Most Likely").
Sophie and Frances, together,
embody everything any person
wants to share with another: the
liberty to be foolish.
From the way Sophie
maternally cradles Frances as
she tells her "The Story of Us,"
their idyllic life scenario in which
Frances is an estimable dancer,
to their all-hands, hair-pulling
wrestling match in Central Park,
the two form a youthful synergy.
Imagine your best friendship's
top moments - the times your
wild side won't soon forget
and your shy side might regret.
Frances and Sophie share these
vulnerable, fuck 'ern memories all
the time because they make each
other braver, more willing to risk
ephemeral shame to strangers
whose opinions, in their minds,
don't matter. That, my friends, is
what friends do.
The best friendship flicks
declare that your friends should
make you want to be a weirder
person, explore weirder spaces,
try weirder stuff.
Hunter S. Thompson once said,
"When the going gets weird, the
weird turn pro." So, friends, sip
the Kool-Aid and I'll see you on
the other side.

It could be a problem if you still
think museums are boring..

ByGRACE HAMILTON
Daily Arts Writer
There is something about
the silence, the slow walking,
the pacing security officers
and endless hallways in many
museums that repel children. Still
working on acquiring the virtue of
patience, most cannot understand
the solitary intimacy of having
a relationship with a painting,
sculpture, artifact or any other
inanimate mass of material.
My own relationship with
museums followed a predictable
series of phases. Before the age of
sevenor so, it wastorture. I did not
realize my fortune growing up in
New York City, rich with craft, a
museum itself of world-wide art.
A fieldtrip to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art did little to capture
my interest. Guided worksheets
and treasure hunts at the Brooklyn
Museum were motivated mainly
by a race to the free chocolate milk
atlunchtime.
The next turning point I can
remember was my two-week
family vacation to Sicily during
December of 2004 - I was eight.
We rented a car and traveled
through four cities, living out
my parents' guidebook fantasies.
Of course, this turned out to be
an average of three museums or
historical sites a day. I have to
believe this would be tiring for
anyone.
I whined, I cried, I complained
about the "rock piles" we drove

miles to see, rock piles like the
Temple of Concord in Agrigento
which appeared later in my
textbooks and lecture slides. I was
a buzzkill. That being said, despite
my nagging and with some time,
some of the things began to gain a
little allure.
Jewelry over a thousand years
old, vases with strange paintings
on the side, cooking tools. My
imagination was stronger than
my patience, and I had begun to
see the fun in dreaming about
the past. I tap-danced in a theater
at Taormina with hundreds of
imaginary patrons watching on.
By the time I had studied
Ancient Rome in sixth grade,
and took our next big vacation
there the same year, I had
abandoned the complaints. It
was amazing: I asked questions,
read the tour books and stayed
with the artwork. Three years
later, I spent 15 minutes with a
painting in Paris by Hieronymus
Bosch, a fifteenth century painter
from the Netherlands, known
for his intricate, fantastical and
frighteningly bizarre work.
By the end of high school, I
occasionally used off days to
explore New York's famous
museums I had neglected as a
child.
In my English class about
Horror, an extra credit assignment
was offered to check out several
paintings at UMMA, a collection
specifically put together for our
course. In a class of about 35, I'd

say no more than five made the
trip. And I have to admit, without
a good excuse, myself included.
What does this say about my
generation's appreciation for
museums? It seems as though
our childhood aversions are hard
to overcome in our later years.
Let's be honest, we're hardly able
to sit through movies anymore
without the pausing and starting
again. What do we expect from
any millennials left with two
hours and no cell phone in the
UMMA?
Though this may appear to be
an overly cynical concern, it is one
worth considering. How can we
change this trajectory? How can
this kind oflearningbe introduced
into classes? An appreciation for
museums ensures that learning
doesn't stop the second the class
period ends, when we graduate
from college or after we get a job.
There is always more to be seen,
more histories to be opened up,
more piles of rock to stand on.
And it certainly does not need to
involve travel or spending.
I'm no expert: I have no
exceptional interpretativeabilities,
knowledgeofarthistory,orspecial
artistic talents myself (my brother
the architect got them). But I do
have curiosity, I have imagination
and, regardless of my patience, I
have appreciation. These faculties
aren't so hard to come by. So go
explore, take a trip to the museum
and see what you can do without a
hand dragging you along.

By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
Michigan football coach Brady
Hoke and defensive coordinator
Greg Mattison are close friends.
They always have been, really.
The two, as strange as it is,
used to wrestle each other while
coaching at Western Michigan.
They had spent years together
before Hoke brought Mattison to
Ann Arbor in 2011.
And even in a year full of
distractions and struggles,
the pair remains close during
practices and games.
Tuesday, junior linebacker Joe
Bolden said of their relationship,
"Imagine your best friend."
Fifth-year senior linebacker
Jake Ryan added: "You can
just tell, when they come in the
meeting room, they can just joke
around with each other, but they
can also be serious."
So as Hoke faces criticism over
his job and the speculation swirls
faster than
the Michigan
wind,
Mattison has You do:
been the first how lu1
to come to the W
head coach's a
defense. He ar
has been there
before, but
Monday, he
laid out his most extensive list of
reasons for support of what Hoke
has done for the program.
But not all of his arguments
hold up, based on the results
they've produced.
"Well, first of all, because
the way he put together these
players," Mattison said. "I believe
our seniors are 100 percent -100
percent graduation rate. Now, I'm
not being sarcastic. This is what
they told me when I came from
the NFL back to college, that this
is what you're supposed to be
doing."
Yes, under Hoke, the
Wolverines have improved their
graduation rate, but his tenure

has also seen 10 off-the-field
incidents in which players have
had arun-in with the law.
"Second thing, I've been with a
lot of head coaches, this guy here
truly, truly takes kids from down
here to here," he said, motioning
his hands from below the podium
to above it. "I'll tell you, if you
don't believe anything I've ever
said, just look at what's coming
back. I mean, look at what we
came in with, and look at what's
comingback. Mygoodness.
"I mean, I can'go on and on,
and these are all the young kids
that you say, 'Why do you get
excited about coaching?' Because
these are the young kids that
we've seen as puppies."
Mattison cited players such
as redshirt sophomore defensive
lineman Chris Wormley, a 280-
pound basketball player who
became "a 300-pound man,"
according to Mattison. There's
Willie Henry, who was a raw
talent out of high school, now
playing as
one of the
Wolverines'
n't know best defensive
linemen.
Cky you There are
k yJ also instances
iere. of recruits who
have struggled,
- including
redshirt
sophomore Terry Richardson, a
touted defensive back who hasn't
seen the field. Fifth-year senior
quarterback Devin Gardner
hasn't played like the star he
was projected to be. And junior
linebacker Royce Jenkins-Stone
has made just two tackles this
season after playing in the Under
Armour All-America game in
high school.
"If you saw what we do in
recruiting," Mattison said, "when
you recruit a kid, you're really his
parent, and you're saying to them,
'Please give him to me, and I
promise you, when he's done, I'm
going to give him back to you as a
great student. He's going to have

his degree, and he's also going to
be a great football player."
The 2015 recruiting class
hasn't fully embraced that
sentiment. The Wolverines
have lost seven verbal commits
from that group, leaving five
remaining as the season comes
to a close.
Lastyear's recruitingclasswas
the seventh-best in the nation,
featuring the No. 2 player in the
nation, defensive back Jabrill
Peppers. Andthe 2012 class was
ranked sixth.
And as for what happens after
players leave AnnArbor?
"How many guys have been
drafted here?" Mattison said.
"When I was here five years ago,
I mean, it was seven (or) eight a
year. Now, somebody said, 'Well,
you don't develop 'em.' Develop
them? You'll see development.
When I talk to these pro people
right now and they start saying,
'Who's that kid? Who's that
kid?' Well, these are the guys we
recruited."
It was just this year the
Wolverines had a player taken
in the opening round of the NFL
Draft for the first time since 2010.
Michigan hasn't had more than
three players drafted since 2008,
before the Rodriguez era.
And yet, the season will be
judged heavily on Hoke's 5-6
record before Ohio State, and
the possibility of missing out on
a bowl game for the first time
since 2010.
"He's a winner," Mattison said.
"He's won everywhere he's been.
The guy's a winner. Now what's
the timetable? We win our first
year? How'd that happen? Man.
I don't know. Something right
happened. Now, was it loaded
that first year? What, we have
two guys drafted? That wasn't
a mirage. That was Brady Hoke
who did that. I mean, let's be
really, really honest.
"I've done this a longtime. I've
been with a lot of head coaches.
I've seen a lot of them. You don't
know htW lucky you are here."

Wolverines ink five-man recruiting class

USHL forward Kyle
Connor headlines
2015-16 class
By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
As if. its 8-1 thrashing of
Penn State on Saturday weren't
enough, the Michigan hockey
team's week just got even better.
Monday, the Wolverines
announced the signing of five
players to National Letters of
Intent for the 2015-16 season -
an expectedly strong class that
the Michigan coaching staff is
thrilled to welcome.
"These classes are years
in the making, but it's nice
to finally get them on paper,"
said associate head coach Billy
Powers in a press release. "On
defense, we feel really good
about getting two right-handed
shots. Up front, we have players
that are coming from the
(United States National Team
Development Program) and the
(United States Hockey League),
and we've found that those two
leagues do a great job in getting
guys ready to. show something
early in their college careers."
Here's the Daily's breakdown
of Michigan's five-player class.
Kyle Connor, Forward,
Youngstown Phantoms
(United States Hockey
League)
The headliner of the class,
Connor is a natural playmaker
who fits in at any of the forward
positions. The Shelby Township
native is in his third season with.
the Phantoms and leads the
team in scoring - with seven
goals and 10 assists - through
its first 14 games. This season's
scoring barrage comes after he
registered 74 points in 56 games
last season.

28 games with Muskegon last
season.
Brendan Warren, forward
(U.S. NTDP)
Though Warren was held
largely in check against the
Wolverines earlier this season,
the forward has been on a tear
since.
The 6-foot, 191-pound
forward has notched 18 points
-11 goals and seven assists - in
21 games this season and, like
Cecconi, was designated a "B"
skater for the upcoming draft.
Warren is a versatile forward,
someone the Michigan coaching
staff hopes will become a
playmaker.
Warren's 11goals for the NTDP
this season are good for fourth
on the team. He was previously
a teammate of freshman
defenseman Zach Werenski and
said earlier this year that they're
still "goodbuddies."
Connor Murphy, forward,
Chicago Steel (USHL)
Murphy is the smallest player
by frame in this class at 5-foot-9
and 168 pounds but has filled the
stat sheet enough this season to
please his current and future
coaches.
Murphy has used his speed
and grittiness to notch seven
goals and five assists through
15 games in his-first season with
the Steel.
Prior to the USHL, Murphy
played for the Caledonia
Corvairs of the Greater Ontario
Junior Hockey League, where
he tallied 96 points - 32 goals
and 64 assists - in just 49 games.
Those 96 points led Murphy to
be named the GOJHL Player of
the Year.

a

JAMESCOLLER/Daily
Michigan hockey coach Red Berenson should have plenty of incomingttalent at his disposal next winter as the Wolverines' five recruits arrive for the 2015-16 season.

The 6-foot-1, 182-pound
forward was labeled an "A"
skater in the NHL Central
Scouting Preliminary 2015
Players-to Watch list. An "A"
rating designates a probable
first-round NHL draft pick.

MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
'M' announces six
recruits to fill gaps

ByKELLY HALL
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's
basketball team won't be
enjoying any turkey for
Thanksgiving this week - but
they'll be all right without it.
The Wolverines are flying
from Ann Arbor to Puerto Rico
on Wednesday night for the San
Juan Shootout, and, "Golly, in
Puerto Rico, they're not doing
the traditional Thanksgiving
dinner" said Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico.
There are seven Division
I teams participating in
this year's tournament, and
the Wolverines will face
Washington State and San Diego
State on Friday and Saturday
afternoon, respectively.
Though Michigan will be
focused on winning, the trip
will also serve as an important
team-bonding experience.
"I think any time we have an
opportunity to take them away,
it's a great experience for the
kids who might not ever get to
do that," Barnes Arico said. "It's
also a great opportunity for us
as a team to really connect."
Added senior forward
Cyesha Goree: "We show (the
freshmen) that we're a home
away from home. Even though
they're not spending time with
their family on Thanksgiving,
they have family here, and we're
their family."
Michigan has a few
longstanding traditions it
practices every Thanksgiving,
but one stands out.
After everyone on the
team talks about what they're
thankful for, the Wolverines
bring out baby pictures of
themselves. A teammate will
pick up a picture and write a
story about that player and why
she's thankful for her teammate.

When turning on the television to watch the weekly fall football game, you probably don't think of the photographerswalkingthrough the tunnel alongside the team and the band. You
don't often notice the photographers stationed underneath the net as the layups and the dunks add-up. Nor do you consider those right next to the action of the school's best athletes. But
you do notice the photos from the next day, the iconic shots that spread on Twitter and the ones thatgrace the covers of the paper. These photographers have stood through unrelenting
rain and spent hours on one knee just to capture the one image for an event, so here are some of the best from this fall semester.

Personal Statement: What it really means to be gone

ann arbor affairs: why i'm smitten with 'SNL'
BY ERIKA HARWOOD

Ican't really recall the specif-
ics of my first time - but I do
remember loving it. It happened
in the middle of the day, around 1
p.m. I was perched on the edge of
my couch, dazed with anticipation
because it was finally, after all those
years, happening.
My parents - in an attempt at
"parenting" - never let me watch
"Saturday Night Live" when I was
a kid. I'm an only child and they
had me at a rather ripe
age, so while they wereI
pretty lax about most
things, they liked to
crack down on my TV
habits. Up until third or v
fourth grade, I almost
exclusively watched
TV Land - not because.
they made me, but .
because I genuinely and
wholeheartedly loved it.
My biggest only-child
quirk is that I was basi-
cally raised tobe some- ILLUSTR
one who was born in
1955, which may also account for
my typically grumpy disposition.
At the age of six, I could give you a
season-by-season account of "The
Brady Bunch," sing the theme song
to "Green Acres" on cue and go on
for hours about why Eddie Haskell
was a real piece of shit.
The one show that trumped them
all though was "I Love Lucy" - and
I didn't have to explicitly tell you
that to make it clear. I watched it
with psychopathic intensity and
collected any and all paraphernalia
I came across. I had books, orna-
ments that lit up and a VHS tape I
took almost everywhere with me
on the off chance there would be a
VCR around (you know the '90s). I
even buried my pet goldfish Lucky
in an "I Love Lucy" themed mint tin

labeled "Lucy's Predicamints." He
was two years old and up until that*
point in my life, his death was the
biggest predicament I had faced, so
it seemed like the right move.
"I Love Lucy" was my gateway
drug into a dangerous addiction to
comedy. I'm thankful to this day that

question - just look at Lucille Ball.
Also, this is 2014 - get it together.
I spent the next formative years
of my life reveling in anything that
made me laugh, even if I didn't get it.
I would watch movies like "Tommy
Boy," "Groundhog Day" and "Cad-
dyshack" with my dad, echoing his
cackleswith added confusion.
As my love for comedy developed,
"Saturday Night Live" was always
in the back of my mind. My dad
would constantly reference old skits
from the '70s and '80s and mention
names I'd be familiar with like Steve
Martin and John Belushi. Yet every
time I brought it up, he'd shut down
my wishes to watch it, telling me it
wasn't appropriate for someone my
age. There was no way around this.,
Our house was very open and I was
afraid he'd hear the TV in the living
room late at night. Also, I diln'treal-
ly know how to operate the remote.
It was mainly the latter holding me
back.
But then my parents got divorced
and my dad had almost zero author-
ity over me. OK, that's not true at
all, but it was definitely a lot easier
to peruse NBC's listings when I
was only confronted with his televi-
sion restrictions every other week-
end, and my mom's attitude toward
my pop culture interests became
increasingly blase.

So then it happened. The first
time I watched "Saturday Night
Live" was directly after I got home
from seventh grade camp, which
was a winter hellscape I thought I'd
never return from. My mom bought
me lunch and I parked my butt
squarely in front of a TV tray and the
E! network. It was a rerun airing in
the middle of the day - a shortened,
hour-longversion of an episode from
the '90s. I don't remember the spe-
cifics; I don't know who the host was
or the musical guest, but I remember
being completely engrossed by the
cast. People like Will Ferrell, Rachel
Dratch and Molly Shannon. From
that point, I was all in. I watched
every rerun on E! that I could, quot-
ing sketches at every opportune (and
inopportune) moment and citing
Chris Kattan as my middle school
crush - yes, the guy who played
Mango.
I started staying up until 11:30
p.m. each Saturday night in order to
finally watch episodes in real time.
This was the era of Tina Fey, Amy
Poehler, Maya Rudolph and Kris-
ten Wiig - I undoubtedly picked
the right time to get into it. I would
record each episode and rewatch
them as often as I could, memoriz-
ing lines and analyzing Weekend
Update jokes - still not fully under-
standing all of them. I'd make friends
reenact my favorite skits (which
were recorded on home videos I'm
afraid to revisit) and embark on what
I assume were excruciatingly long
discussions on the past week's show.
I was in love and Lorne Michaels
was cupid.
The affair accompanied me to col-
lege, where I would frequently opt
out of healthy social interactions in
order to stay in and watch TV on Sat-
urday nights. I was miserable - as
most bratty18 year olds are - for the
bulkofmyfreshmanyear,andwould
relish in the moments I got to be by
myself and watch "SNL."
The show has changed alot since
I started watching, and at times, I'm
critical of it, but in the way a high
school football coach from Texas
is critical of his star quarterback.
"SNL" is the reason I started writing
and the reason I wasn't a bigger pain
in the ass as a teenager. It's the rea-
son I fell so deeply in love with com-
edy - a feeling I've yet to shake years
and years after that one afternoon on
my couch.

A village means to not be alone,
to know that there's some-
hing of you in the people, in
the plants, and in the soil, that even
when you are not there it waits to
welcomeyou."
- Cesare Pavese, "The Moon
and the Bonfires"
My grandmother died this year
on a Monday night in September.
My brother called me at work
that night and told me she had been
admitted to the University Hospi-
tal. He said it was serious, so I left
work, got on my bike and frantically
pedaled over to the
emergency room.
She was already
unconscious when I
arrived, a respirator
keeping her alive as the
doctors and my aunts
and uncles decided
whether to turn off the
machine. The aneu-
rysm resting near her
heart had finally burst,
and there was nothing
left to be done. They
turned off the respira-
tor. I watched her heart
rate slowly drop to zero }
on the monitor. I held n
her hand as the doctor
felt for a missing pulse.
In a way, it seemed
fitting that she should
go on a Monday. Every
week from when I was
about five years old,
I had spent Monday
evenings sitting in the
armchair on the left side of her
living room, "America's Funniest
Home Videos" playing on the TV
while Iate bowls ofstrawberry Jell-
O and butter pecan ice cream.
Monday nights didn't vary too
much from week to week. They
started with opening the sliding
door to her condo, being greeted by
the smell of rosemary, the warmth
of the stove, the pitcher of mint
iced tea ready to be poured and she,
looking very much like a little Ital-
ian grandma in her purple blouse,
pearl necklace and glasses, waiting
for me to hand her the mail.
In the evening, while I ate my
Jell-O, she would sit in her reclin-
er on the other side of the room,
thumbing through a magazine or
looking at old pictures. Between
commercials, when both my broth-
er and my dad had dozed off in their
chairs, we would talk about her
friends Rose and Diana, her latest

bingo winnings at the senior center
and about the new Spanish mass at
her church.
We would say goodbye at
around 10 - a kiss for my dad, a
hug for my brother and I - and as
we pulled away she stood behind
the glass of her sliding door, waving
until we were out of view.
When she died, I didn't have any
regrets. Having spent four or five
hours with her every week for the
better part of 15 years, it wasn't like
there was any dinner we could have
had together, but didn't; any words
we never got the chance to say.

disjointed phrases, the faint residue
of smells and sounds, a missing feel-
ing of home.
She was fading into the back-
ground of faces from my childhood,
becoming another one of the dead
relatives lining the pages of our
photo albums, turning into a set of
anecdotal stories. She seemed, with
each day, less and less like the per-
son I knew, with all her affectations
and complexities, and more like an
ossified, idealized caricature of her-
self. This was what it really meant
for her to be gone.

tion home by any of the Michigan
DePollos willing to make the eight-
hour drive.
My friends and I stayed in her
house for a few days, cooking piero-
gies on her stove and watching her
DVDs of "The Andy Griffith Show."
My aunt used to call TV the "idiot
box," which sounded more like "ijit
box" in her West Virginia twang.
She thought it was an unnecessary
waste of time, which she preferred
to spend spying on the neighbors
through her windows and listen-
ing for the slightest crackle coming
from her police scanner.

As I buttoned my pants and
dried my hands, the uncle I never
met smiling back at me through the
glass, I felt myself trying to stifle a
chuckle. It was a funny scene, after
all. Here we were, the only DePol- A#
los left in DePollo's Store, having a
wordless conversation over a toilet.
Maybe he was a pretty charming
guy.
Following the calendar, it was
still summer when I was in Davis.
But fall comes early in West Vir-
ginia. At night, cool, moist airblows
down from the mountaintop, con-
densing into a thick fog
when it meets the tree-
lined roads warmed by
the August sunshine.
Our last night on
the mountain was one
of those foggy nights,
when the air is thick
and the houses are out
of focus. Looking down
into the mist from a win-
dow in my Aunt Lucy's
bedroom, I thought
about what I would tell
my grandmother when
Q I got back to Michigan.
I thought I would 4
tell her about meeting
my uncle in the bath-
room at DePollo's Store,
about watching the
"ijit box" in her sister's
house, about the fog on
the mountain, about the
S- AD pierogies and almond
brittle.
I knew the stories
she would tell me about her broth-
er-in-law John. I could see the bit-
tersweet smile that would come
across her face when I told her
about watching Aunt Lucy's TV.
I could hear her laugh when she
tried to picture me, the grandson
that never learned to cook, burn-
ing pierogies and setting off smoke
detectors in her sister's kitchen.
I didn't get to tell her about
West Virginia before she died but,
in a way, it didn't matter.
In that moment, though she was
400 miles away, watching her last
few episodes of "Dancing with the
Stars" in a condo in Novi, I could-
picture her with as much clarity as
if she were in Lucy's bedroom with
me, looking down into the fog-filled
streets.
In that mountaintop town in
West Virginia, there's something of
her that's much more real than an
old face in a photo album.

If anything, it had seemed in
recent years that we were running
out of things to say. She was 94 and
it was getting harder for her to stay
up talking until 10 o'clock. She start-
ed repeating the same stories week
after week, the TV filled up longer
and longer silences. I hadn't spoken
to her in three weeks before that
last Monday night in September.
In hindsight, she seemed to be
slowly fading away. And after the
funeral, after the out-of-town rela-
tives had returned home, after the
tearful remembrances and divvied
up assets, she was gone.
What bothered me was how dif-
ferent this type of "gone" felt from
simple absence. Even when I think
of her now, I don't hear her voice or
see her face. I remember the smell
of warm rosemary, Tom Bergeron
narrating crotch shots, tears drop-
ping on a wrinkled hand hanging
off the side of a hospital bed. A set of

Three weeks before she died,
I was driving with two friends on
narrow mountain roads, listening
to Biggie Smalls and eating almond
brittle.
We were 3,100 feet above sea
level in Davis, West Virginia, the
tiny coal mining town where my
grandma grew up and where her
younger sister Lucy retired after
a long career sewing car seats at
a Ford Motor Company factory in
Detroit. Their parents had immi-
grated to Davis from Sulmona, a
small city in Italy's mountainous
Abruzzo region, to join the commu-
nity of expatriate Italians digging
tunnels into the peaks around the
town.
Aunt Lucy had moved back into
her parents' house in the '80s, but
she died last spring and, since then,
the precariously perched, sheet*
metal-encased building was sitting
empty, waitingto be used as a vaca-

As I lay in her old bed, watch-
ing a young Ron Howard cavort
across the screen, I remembered
that she had been learning to play
the piano in her old age. She wasn't
done being a person. I wondered if
she had changed her mind about the
"ijit box."
On our last night in West Vir-
ginia, we went to watch a five-piece
band from Alabama play rockabilly
at the Purple Fiddle, a cafe built in
what was once my family's general
store. I paid the $10 cover charge
while looking at a sign resting over
the hostess's shoulder, mixed in
with the other antique odds and
ends liningthe cafe's shelves. It read
"DePollo's Store."
An obituary for my great uncle
John, the last DePollo to own the
family store, was hanging in the
cafe's bathroom. I never knew him,
but my aunts and uncles always told
me that he was a real lady-killer.

ACTIVISM
From Page 5B

make sure that there was a communal agree-
ment about what those things would be,"
Greenfield said.
This represents the difficult conflation in
activism between online success and actual
change, an issue activists from all move-
aThents continually face.
Eljamal believes it was critical that the
BDS movement had tangible events and
presence outside of social media. While
they posted photos and updates alongside
hashtags on social media sites, especially
during the silent CSG meetings and their sit-
in, SAFE placed a strong emphasis on incit-
ing students to actually participate in these
events rather than just liking a post online.
"We know you read it - great. We know
you watched it - great," Eljamal said. "What
are you goingto do about it now?Go to events,
ANmake sure your thoughts and actions reflect
what you are learning on social media."
Despite these movements' efforts to con-
nect the intangible with the tangible, it's still
easy for people to hide behind their comput-
er screens; given the "trendiness" of activism
on college campuses, especially liberal ones
like the University, there is a certain social
cache in proving your social justice back-
ground online.
"It's always been trendy to be a social
justice person at college," Desai said. "The
people who do decide to join (social justice)
because it is trendy, it's problematic for them
"co do it for that reason alone, because they
aren't taking the steps necessary to work
through their own privilege and their own
identities, and starting to engage in a way
that is respectful of other people's experi-
ences."
This "keyboard courage" can also have
a darker, more subversive side. Internet
"trolls," or people who use social media to
limit or abuse communities and identities,
are an unfortunate side effect of the advent
of social media. These aggressors can hide
behind screen names, granting them nearly
untouchable privacy and power.
One on-campus example occurred dur-
ing the BDS campaign. A Facebook picture
of Former SAFE member Yazan Kherallah,
now a University alum, featured him holding
a pineapple and a knife. The photo was picked
up by a Washington Free Beacon staffer who
wrote a vitriolic, hyperbolic piece, attacking
Kherallah as an individual and the Islamic
community as a whole.
Despite the negative emotional and struc-
tural consequences these "trolls" can have,
Hardy doesn't necessarily believe that the
access they or even conservative outlets have
'W' o social networks is completely negative.
"Those horrible people are going to be out
there either way, and I think it's really impor-
tant that both views are presented," Hardy
said with a laugh. "Not because of freedom
or whatever, but just so people can see what a
fucking joke a lot of that other stuff is."
This "other stuff" can also refer to a recent
Fox news clip that came out in response to

a video showing the prevalence of street
harassment in New York City, which gar-
nered over 36 million YouTube views. In
the Fox news clip, commentators belittled
the actions of those fighting against street
harassment - one commentator even objec-
tified the woman in the original video, say-
ing "Damn, baby, you're a piece of woman."
Media clips such as this are a fitting remind-
er for activists that the "other side" has

cisco's subway system, shutdown cell phone
service in order to curtail involvement in a
possible protest.
While aggressive actions such as this have
yet to be taken against protests at the Uni-
versity, it shows the delicate balance activ-
ists face between utilizing social media and
having it be used against them.
Moreover, in the flurry of discussion sur-
rounding technology and how it's rapidly

"The ubiquity of smart phones, especially
smart phones that come free with a phone
plan, is changing the game in a lot of ways,"
Hardy said. "But I still think there is a digi-
tal divide, and there is a lot of work being
done right now to increase literacy in under-
served populations and to try to ramp up
access."
This once again reinforces for activists
how imperative physical impact is in a move-
ment - not only does it demonstrate a truly
dedicated base, it allows oppressed popula-
tions to be reached out to through multiple
avenues.
An evolving campus, an uncertain future
Walking across the Diag on a Tuesday in
November, campus seems busy. Students
scuttle to class, wrapped in parkas and over-
sized scarfs. A tent to one side promotes
Blood Battle and a large group of students
stand over the block 'M,' encouraging those
who pass to join the student organization
optiMize. Written on one wall of the Hatch-
er Graduate Library is the phrase "Save the
Lost 43," a reference to the tragic abduction
of 43 college students in Mexico. Spray-paint
on the Diag reads "EXPEL RAPISTS" and
"ADMINS DEFEND RAPISTS."
University students are not, and probably
will never be, complacent when it comes to
issues of social justice. A quick survey of the
physical center of our campus is evidence
of that. However, as social media continues
to expand and change the course of soci-
ety, activism changes along with it. Despite
the setbacks that come with a less physi-
cally engaged community base, both Hardy
and Greenfield believe that social media is
ultimately beneficial for furthering social
change.
"Someone is always going to capitalize on
it," Greenfield said. "You are always going to
have something that's trendy, but I have faith
that that wouldn't overcome good inten-
tions."
"I feel like the amount of people being
reached by social media is exponentially
larger than the amount of people that you
can meet door-knocking in a neighborhood
about a certain issue," Hardy said.
Ultimately, Campbell argues that the indi-
vidual will always be the most critical part of
successful activism.
"I think when we are trying to explain
and understand activism today and how it's
changed, we need to be careful not to over-
look the social component of this, because
the technology by itself doesn't do anything
at all," Campbell said.
"It's highly dependent on individual users,
and what they bring to the table in terms of
their motivations and their skills and their
desire to maximize the capabilities of the
technology - to make them better informed
citizens, to make them more effective activ-
ists, and without that, the technology on its
own isn't going to do anything."

access too; this means detractors and trolls,
but also institutions of power.
"The thing that is the other side of this
coin, is that technology is used to empower
the establishments to, in some cases, squelch
protests," Campbell said. "Although I don't
think that's what we are seeing here on this
campus."
Examples of this range from governmen-

institutional interference. Campbell recalls a

as often groups that are marginalized - and

access to emerging media, like smart phones
or Twitter.

thing around technology, you make a lot of
assumptions, and the first is that people are'

with," Greenfield said.

in student social justice
movements.
A new platform
"Socialmedia and infor-=
mation communication
technology, that's the infra,
structure that we now have, that people have
access to," said Scott Campbell, the Pohs pro-
fessor of Telecommunications and associate
professor within the Communication Studies
department. "That's the platform
upon which activism takes place."
Social media's impact can be seen
in multiple student movements over
the past year. The hashtag #Black-
LivesMatter quickly gained trac-
tion this week on social media
in response to the grand jury
decision not to charge Officer
R ARTS EDITOR Darren Wilson in the shooting
of Ferguson teenager Michael
Brown, resulting in protests
and vigils around the country.

One such vigil occurred on campus this Tues-
day at 6 p.m. Over 1,200 users said they were
attending the event on Facebook, which saw
a large gathering on the Diag by students and
community members that featured five speak-
ers, and then a march to the Ann Arbor City
Council Building.
Another student movement occurred when
The Black Student Union led the nationally-
recognized campaign, Being Black at U of M,
which started in fall 2013, and led to further
action in January. The campaigngarnered mil-
lions of impressions online and over 500,00
tweets containing the hashtag #BBUM, shar-
ing the experiences and challenges of Black
students on campus. Representatives from the
BSU were featured on national news platforms
like CNN and in the New York Times, and their
widespread success propelled them topropose
seven demands of the University, ranging from
a more welcoming multicultural center to a
mandated 10 percent representation of Black
students on campus as a proportion of the over-
all student body.
Engineering senior Robert Greenfield, BSU
treasurer, said that the immediate success
of the campaign took the group by surprise,
and demonstrated the power of social media
efforts.
"BBUM was a very volatile time for the Black
community," Greenfield said. "Trayvon Martin
happened that summer, there was the Theta Xi
incident and alot of incidents like that around
the nation."
The Theta Xi incident, which was an impe-
tus for the BSU's campaign and their seven
demands, refers to a frat party invitation
sent out on Facebook in Nov. 2013. The party
was entitled "Hood Ratchet Thursday" and
the invitation featured racially offensive and
appropriating depictions of Black culture.
"We just needed to get people together, get
over these grudges, maybe get 200 tweets and
that will be that," Greenfield said. "Obviously,
we were kind of blindsided."
Mere months after BBUM went viral, anoth-
er protest rocked the University, as Students
Allied for Freedom and Equality launched

the boycott, divestment and sanctions move-
ment at the University, a campaign demanding
the University divest from companies alleg-
edly providing services to the Israeli govern-
ment that support their actions in Palestine.
This movement came with its own hashtag,
#UMDivest, and discussion of the protest took
over campus and other campuses around the
country. While SAFE emphasized physical
presence over online campaigning, they used
social media to bypass rules in Central Student
Government meetings that do not allow any
speaking during official proceedings.
"Our frustrations (were) with the things
that were said (during the CSG meetings), we
couldn't keep talking to the person next to us,
so we went to Twitter and posted stuff like
'This was what was just said, " said LSA sopho-
more Mekarem Eljamal, current SAFE spokes-
person and Outreach chair.
Not all social media-based moments of
activism on campus have received such levels
of attention as BBUM or BDS - which is not
to say other groups haven't used social media
to make a positive impact. LSA senior Meera
Desai, a member of the Vietnamese Student
Association, recalls an event that occurred
last November while University students were
visiting Michigan State University for a foot-
ball game, in which they were called racially-
offensive terms by MSU students. In protest,
the group posted a letter to their Tumblr page,
addressing the prevalence of anti-Asian racism
at Midwestern as well as national universities.
The letter received responses of support from
across the country, reaching diverse communi-
ties in ways only possible through the Internet.
"Social media has definitely helped my orga-
nization realize that it's a message that can
get to a lot of people on a national level," Desai
said. "It's not a singular event, it's not random
encounter, it's part of something bigger."
Building a network
While the ubiquity of social media in our
lives and in social justice is evident, the ulti-
mate impact of the use of technology within

activism is still hotly debated. However, both
academics and students agree that social media
has created a new space for marginalized
groups, bridging gaps in unprecedented ways.
Information graduate student Jean Hardy
specializes in the ways social media and
new information systems impact those with
oppressed identities, particularly within the
LBGTQ community.
"People who may have feelings about their
sexuality or their gender at a younger age now
find wafe to find community online, in places
like Twitter or Tumblr," Hardy said. "They
kind of build a network of support that way
without actually having to be physically locat-
ed in an epicenter of gay or trans life, like Chi-
cago or Seattle or San Francisco."
Desai also believes that social media has
contributed to community building, citing her
own mixed ethnicity as a catalyst for finding a
community with shared experiences online.
"I think social media has helped a lot," Desai
said. "It has helped people meet each other,
people who are invested in the same causes and
have the same identities and experiences."
Just as websites like Twitter and Tumblr
have the ability to connect those who may
have been adrift before, the advent of messag-
ing technology also allows groups to mobilize
quicker than ever.
In October, more than 1,000 students, in
one of the largest on=campus protests in years,
rallied at the University President's house,
demanding that he fire now-former Athletic
Director Dave Brandon. The protest was orga-
nized in less than two days, mobilizing partici-
pants through a widely shared Facebook event
and cell phone communication. While this
protest drew ire from many students - even
prompting a viewpoint in The Michigan Daily
questioning the turn out to protest Brandon
in response to a football game rather than the
Brendan Gibbons sexual assault case - it also
was a compelling demonstration of our genera-
tion's ability to use technology to organize in
ways unheard of before.
"(The Dave Brandon protest) is a great
example of how (students) were able to mobi-

lize so nimbly with each other, getting the
word out through text messaging and social
media to raise awareness about this protest,"
said Campbell, who focuses on emerging media
and mobile communications. "I think that kind
of thing absolutely was possible in the past, but
I don't think it would have been pulled togeth-
er as quickly as it was in this particular case."
Grounding a movement
Social media allows information about phys-
ical events to have a greater reach at a much *%m
faster pace, connecting individuals with an
ease very different from the grassroots move-
ments of decades ago. However, social media
can also breed a culture of laziness in activism
- wider reach sometimes means the dissolu-
tion or misrepresentation of a cause or identity.
This phenomenon goes under multiple names
- slacktivism, keyboard courage, click activ-
ism, armchair activism - but they all encom-
pass the idea that it's easy to "like" a social
issue without really investing in it.
"Social media, for all causes, can bastardize
the cause if there is no materialistic effort that
extends outside the Internet ethos into what is
reality," Greenfield said. "For us, (the material-
istic effort) was blacking out the wall in Angell
Hall."
After the BBUM hastag went viral, the Black
Student Union covered a wall in Angell Hall in
black paper and had students write anecdotes
and phrases regarding their experiences as
Black students at the University. The action did
not go unnoticed on campus.
"I feel like (for) so many white students at
U of M, that was their first exposure to insti-
tutional racism just being talked about in gen-
eral," Hardy said.
The success of the BBUM campaign
required the BSU to step back and reevaluate
its demands - with great reach comes great
responsibility.
"It really forced us to do a lot of research and
put in a lot of time, not only to come up with
what would then be the seven demands, but to
