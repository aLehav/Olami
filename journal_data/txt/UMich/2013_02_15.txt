The factory that's a world away
may be long closed, but the fight
over.Adidas' handling of the situa-
tion and the University's relation-
ship with the company appears to
be anything but settled.
On Thursday, 12 members of
the University's chapter of United
Students Against Sweatshops
joined two Indonesian sweatshop
workers in a protest on the Diag to
put pressure on University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman to sever
the University's $60-million con-
tract until Adidas agrees to pay the
workers the $1.8-million sever-
ance they claim they are owed.
The PT Kizone factoryin Indo-
nesia closed 22 months ago after
its owner - a subcontractor for
Adidas -fled the country as the
plant went into bankruptcy. In
October, Coleman sent an open.
letter to Adidas expressing con-
cern over the way severance was
handled at the plant.
Coleman wrote that Adidas'

food vouchers and efforts to find
new employment for the former
employees were inadequate solu-
tions. She requested periodic
updates from the company about
the situation and progress toward
afinal settlement.
The University currently holds
Adidas' largest collegiate contract
in the countryt the eight-year
agreement that began in 2008 is
worth $60 million. Cornell Uni-
versity and Oberlin College have
severed or reduced contracts with
Adidas in protest of Adidas han-
dling of the PT Kizone situation.
Event organizers repeatedly
emphasized the University's size-
able relationship with Adidas at
Thursday's protest. The event
included brief speeches from the
two Indonesian sweatshop work-
ers, interpreted from their native
language by atranslator.
"We are here from Indonesia
representing 2,700 ex-(sweatshop)
workers from Adidas," said Aslam
Hidayat, a former garment worker
at the PT Kizone factory. "We
stand here before you asking your

ByMATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
After the University's recent
land grabs, Ann Arbor city officials
are looking to strike a compromise
for future land purchases given the
University's tax-exempt status and
the effects it may have on the city's
economic development.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
said while the city has been very
cooperative with the University's
purchase of tax-exempt proper-
ties, he believes the problem has
become too important to ignore
any longer.
"We've really stepped up our
cooperation around econom-
it development in the last 10
years," Hieftje said. "It is kind of
an inevitable outcome if the Uni-
versity continues to buy proper-
ty in the city and that is that the
city will be less able to provide
services.
Hieftje said the city is willing to
make compromises with the Uni-
versity to solve the land use issues,
and would like to engage in con-

President coy about
potential costs in
trip to Georgia
DECATUR, Ga. (AP) - Rais-
ing hopes among parents who
want preschool for all, Presi-
dent Barack Obama on Thurs-
day rolled out a plan to vastly.
expand government-funded
early childhood while keeping
the price tag a secret.
Republicans, wary of high
costs and questionable outcomes,
made clear they have no intention
of signing a blank check.
Setting up yet another clash
with Republicans over spending
and the proper scope of govern-
ment, Obama in his State of the
Union address proposed work-
ing with states to make high-
quality preschool available to
every American child. Two days
later, he played blocks and gave

fist-bumps to kids in a preschool
classroom at the College Heights
Early Childhood Learning Cen-
ter in Decatur, casting the plan as
part of a moral imperative to give
every child a shot at success..
"The size of your paycheck
shouldn't determine your child's
future," Obama told about 600
teachers and parents at the Deca-
tur Community Recreation Cen-
ter, singling out Georgia as a model
for making universal preschool a
priority. "Let's fix this. Let's make
sure none of our kids start out the
race of life already a step behind."
The White House offered
the first details about Obama's
plan Thursday, describing it as a
"continuum of high-quality early
learning for a child, beginning at
birth and continuing to 'age 5."
The government would fund pub-
lic preschool for any 4-year-old
wlose family income is 200 per-
cent or less of the federal poverty
level - a more generous thresh-

fl-U H

old than the current Head Start
program, which generally serves
kids from families below 130
percent of the poverty line. All
50 states and the federal govern-
ment would chip in.
Obama also proposed letting
communities and child care
providers compete for grants to
serve children 3 and younger,
starting from birth. And once a
state has established its program
for 4-year-olds, it can use funds
from the program to offer full-
day kindergarten, the plan says.
Conspicuously absent from
Obama's plan were any details
about the cost, a key concern
among Republicans. Obama's
aides have insisted the new
programs would not add to the
nation's nearly $16.5 trillion debt,
but they won't say what else will
be cut to offset the cost, offering
only vague allusions to cutting
entitlement spending and clos-
ing loopholes.

Herman Nackaerts, head of the Department of Safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency talks to media after
his arrival from Iran.
Di1omat claims Iran
has new atomic tech.

U.N. talks fail to
reach deal to restart
investigation
VIENNA (AP) - Adding
weight to its announcement
of a nuclear upgrade, Tehran
has shown high-level U.N.
officials high-tech equipment
positioned at its main uranium
enrichment site meant to vast-
ly accelerate output of mate-
rial that can be used for both
reactor fuel and atomic arms, a
senior diplomat said Thursday.
The diplomat spoke to The
Associated Press shortly after
the officials returned from
Tehran, acknowledging that
their latest in a series of trips to
the Iranian capital that began
over a year ago again failed to
reach a deal to restart an inves-
tigation into suspicions that
Iran is pursuing nuclear arms.
Herman Naeckerts, who
headed the International Atom-
ic Energy Agency team that
visited Iran, said "remaining
differences" scuttled attempts
to finalize an agreement on how
such an investigation should be
conducted. He declined to say
whether there was progress.
The IAEA wants the probe

to be open-ended, something
strenuously opposed by Tehran,
which denies it wants nuclear
weapons and says it is interest-
ed in the atom only as an energy
source and for research.
With expectations for suc-
cess low even before the start of
the latest negotiating attempt,
interest focused on Iran's move
to install a new generation of
centrifuges at Natanz, its main
uranium enriching site south-
east of Tehran.
Iran announced the start of
installations during the IAEA
team's one-day visit Wednes-
day at about the same time that
the diplomat said the group was
shown "a small number" of the
machines at the site. The diplo-
mat said those centrifuges were
ready to be installed. The diplo-
mat, who closely follows Iran's
nuclear program, demanded
anonymity because his informa-
tion was confidential.
The new-generation centri-
fuges can enrich uranium four
to five times faster than Iran's
present working model. Experts
say Iran already has, enough
enriched uranium for several
weapons if it is further enriched.
Any move to enrich faster
will rile Israel, which sees Iran's
nuclear program as an existen-

tial threat and has said it would
use all means to stop it from
reaching weapons capability.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has warned that the
world has until this summer -
at the latest - to keep Iran from
building abomb.
Italso islikelyto hurtchances
of progress at talks in Kazakh-
stan later this month between
Iran and six world powers seek-
ing to blunt Iran's enrichment
program. Iran in turns wants
an easing of sanctions imposed
over its enrichment program
before it is ready to reduce it.
The failure of either side to
make the initial move hasled to
a series of failed negotiations.
Nonproliferation expert Mark
Fitzpatrick said Iran's centri-
fuge upgrade may be a further
signal that it is determined not
to blink first.
"Installation of the more effi-
cient centrifuges will probably
contributetoIran'sunwillingness
to compromise," said Fitzpatrick,
aformersenior U.S. State Depart-
ment official now with the Inter-
national Institute for Strategic
Studies. "It bolsters Iran's belief
that time is on its side and that the
West will eventually have to give
in to the pressure of Iran's grow-
ingenrichment capacity.

Senate passes
bill to let public
handle bear cubs
An Upper Peninsula bear ranch
could legally let visitors touch
and pose for photos with bear
cubs under legislation approved
Thursday by the Michigan Sen-
ate, as lawmakers disagreed over
the wisdom of having dangerous
animals at roadside attractions.
* The bill headed to the House
also would free up other facilities
to allow public contact with bears
under 9 months old or weighing
no more than 90 pounds, though
the sponsor is unsure if similar
places exist in Michigan.
Oswald's Bear Ranch, which
claims to be the largest bear ranch
in the U.S. with 29 roaming black
bears, is near Newberry - about

Three A drug kingpin in Mex-

new Public Enemy No. 1 - the
same notorious label assigned
" to Al Capone at the height of the
Prohibition-era gang wars.
The Chicago Crime Commis-
sion announced the move Thurs-
day, saying it considers Joaquin
"El Chapo" Guzman even more
menacing than Capone because
he's the leader of the Sinaloa car-
tel, which supplies most of the
narcotics sold in the city.
"What Al Capone was to beer
and whiskey during Prohibition,
Guzman is to narcotics," said Art
Bilek, the commission's executive
vice president. "Of the two, Guz-
man is by far the greater threat.
... And he has more power and
financial capability than Capone
ever dreamed of."

accused the government of try-
ing to cover up the death.
The boy, Omar Salah, was

ing clashes in the area. Activists
discovered his death coinciden-
tally as they were searching for

French company

The price, smell and color

something was wrong with ship-

French authorities said Thursday.
The government pinned the bulk
of the blame on a French whole-

scandal in Europe.
Police in the U.K., meanwhile,
announced the arrests Thursday
of three men on suspicion of fraud
at two meat plants inspected ear-
lier this week by the country's
Food Standards Agency.
The two separate develop-
ments were part of an escalating

ple and wounding 17 others..
Tony Holt, Wayne State Uni-
versity police chief, outlined the
factors that go into making tacti-
cal decisions similar to UMPD's
armed response.
"In a University setting, you
have to be very proactive," Holt
said. "At Wayne State, there are
no weapons allowed, (so) if we got
a call, with even the suspicion of
someone having a weapon on Uni-
versity property, we would prob-
ably first send out a text alert to
the campus community and then
launch a full tactical operation."
Like WSU, the University pro-
hibits weapons on campus.
Holt said that whenever there
is even the possibility of danger
in a campus setting, immediate
action must be taken to ensure
student safety and minimize dis-
placement, even if the presence of
a weapon cannot be confirmed.
"Whenever a gun is even a pos-
sibility, we have to err on the side
of caution and safety because you
don't get second chances in situa-
tions like this," Holt said.
Though an armed police
response may have scared some
students, Holt said it's better to
be safe than sorry, comparing it to
sending officers to investigate ifa
fire exists instead of a fire truck.
"We don't take anythingas a
joke. A lot of people may think it's
sion on the same topic.

Boullion told the story of one
young patient who, after being1
told he wouldn't be in the hospital1
on Thursdays, said he didn't want
to come to the hospital at all.
"This little boy would come1
in on Monday and go home on;

"One day the doctor says 'Okay,
Brad, we're going to change your
protocol so you can go to school

Typically, there are some-

where from 30 to 40 student
athletes participating in the pro-
gram, but in January, Schuster
said there were a record 107 stu-
dent athlete volunteers.
Swimmer Angie Chokran, a
LSA junior, has been volunteer-
ing regularly on Thursday nights
since she was a freshman.
"This is something I look
forward to during the week,"
Chokran said. "This program
means a lot more to me than I
can put into a couple of sentences.
Being here and having the oppor-
tunity to brighten someone's day
is huge, but they don't realize
they're brightening our day too."
Soccer player Tyler Leppek,
a LSA junior, said the Thursday
night visits offer a much-needed

overkill for cops to come in full
tactical gear, but student and cam-
pus safety has to be our number
one priority at all times," Holtosaid.
The proximity and credibility
of incident reports is crucial in
determining the course of action
to be taken, said Ronald Haddad,
chief of police in Dearborn, Mich.
"You can always scale back
the investigation when it's deter-
mined that he's not a threat, but
when you don't know what you're
dealing with, you have to error on
the side of caution," Haddad said.
"Obviously it would have been
unacceptable if the tip had been
discredited and then the suspect
turned around and shot up a
bunch of young people."
Haddad said UMPD's imme-
diate, armed response was nec-
essary because the DeFluri was
in a campus environment with a
large, dense population.
"I understand the validity of
the first amendment and this
young man's right to express
himself, but imagine if he'd gone
to an airport (in camouflage and
a gas mask)," Haddad said. "He
would have been immediately
met by police, Department of
Homeland Security, Transporta-
tion Security Administration and
everyone else, because you can't
take those kind of risks."
The 2007 Virginia Tech shoot-
ing and last year's incidents in
Aurora, Colo., and Newtown,

people under the age of 25. There

money would undoubtedly makew
a difference in the lives of her
family members. p
"It would mean a lot for us," f
Heni said. "I was in the sewing c
business, so I could open a small I
tailor shop and be able to fulfill o
my family's dailyneeds." p
Both mentioned the "code of con-a
duct" between Adidas and the Uni-
versity, which they believe has been v
broken. Heni and Hidayat believe o
that if they continue business rela- r
tions despite their breach ofcontract;

Arielle Wisbaum, LSA fresh- o
man and USAS member, said u
she felt the demonstration - the l
result of months of planning - i
was a success. USAS raised funds t
in conjunction with the organiza- tl
distraction for the patients. d
"I feel like it takes their mind o
off what's going on in the hospital
and gives them a new face to see," a
Leppek said. "Taking pictures F
with them makes (the patients) i
the center of attention in a posi- t
tive light." e
Swimmer Roman Willets, an
education senior, said the volun- k
teering experience impacts both t
the patients and athletes in a t
meaningful way. S
"First and foremost it keeps s
things in perspective for us as a
athletes. Sometimes people get d
bogged down by a tough practice l

According to a Jan. 22 video
report by CBS News, police units
across the country are retrain-
ing officers to better confront
uncertain situations, especially
when there is an active shooter
is involved. In a training exercise
at George Mason University, offi-
cers moved in without waitingfor
backup and swept the hallways
searching to find the "shooter."
At the University of Michigan,
police appeared to respond in a
similar manner. Regular, uni-

In September, the Univer-
sity of Texas and North Dakota
State University both responded
quickly to bomb threats on their
campuses, forcingthe evacuation
of tens of thousands of students.
No suspicious items were found
in both cases, but administrators
acted quickly to warn students
via text, e-mail, and website post-
ings. No such warning or commu-
nication was issued immediately
at the University of Michigan on
Thursday, though UMPD's web-
site was updated. periodically
with information.
UMPD alerts the University

cy Alert System when it feels a situ-
ation poses a campus-widethreat.
Brown said the system was not

Fischer said the organization

Athletic department offi-
ials did not respond to several
equests for comment for this

were limited to one building.
"The Emergency Alert System
is to used when there is a con-
firmed, imminent threaf that the
majority of people need to take
cover," Brown said. "Our campus
is different for one single build-
ing. It was one building, so offi-
cers were doing their best to deal
with that one building."
Universities and colleges
across the country have also
faced false alarm situations from
internal miscommunication. Last
year, Tulane University errone-
ously sent an emergency text
message to students warning of
a shooter at an unspecified loca-
tion. Officials later retracted the
message and wrote that it was
accidentally released during a
training session for the emergen-
cy rsponse system.
In 2011, U.S. Capitol Police in
Washington, D.C. responded to
reports that a gunman had been
spotted near the Georgetown
University Law Center. Officers
later found a gun nearby, but
determined it was unrelated to
the incident and Georgetown
released an "all-clear" message
to its campus community within
a few hours.

They aim for "a policy that
will govern these issues and
that would ensure that the
city would not see continually
diminishing revenues from the
University's land purchases,"
Hieftje said.
Hieftje added that he and
Councilmember Sally Hart
Petersen (D-Ward 2) have
been working on a proposal to
ease the issue. While he would
not specify what the proposal
will entail, Hieftje said he and
Petersen would be "putting it
into a formal request" in about
a month.
Councilmember Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3) said even
though the University is vital to
the city's economy, he advocates
a settlement on standards that
would stop the city's increasing
revenue losses.
"There is no question that
the University is the primary
economic driver in the city and
the region, and that the Univer-
sity's growth is important to the
city," Taylor said. "That said,
the University's growth in the
city clearly reduces the tax base
and reduces the city's ability to
provide services to its residents
and the University, and it's my
hope a reasonable accommoda-
tion will be made."
Jim Kosteva, the University's
director of community rela-
tions, said the conflict over the
University's tax-exempt sta-
tus resurfaces every four-to-
six years in a "cyclical nature,"
often after the University pur-
chases a cluster of properties.
"Some folks get a little anx-

ious about the properties that
are removed from the tax rolls
and what the impact (will be),"
Kosteva said.
Recently, the University
purchased the site of Blimpy
Burger and a nearby property
for $1.5 million. Since 1999, the
University has purchased, 29
pieces of land in total around
the city. When the University
bought the former Pfizer build-
ing - now the North Campus
Research Complex - in 2009,
the city's revenue from prop-
erty taxes decreased by 4.8 per-
cent.
According to Kosteva, the
University has added 9,000
jobs to Ann Arbor's economy
over the past 10 years. He said
the University brings immense
value to the city.
"Nevertheless, the Univer-
sity feels convinced that it does
add a very substantial value to
the community, and that our
growth, our expansion, our ful-
fillment of our public mission
does provide a very substantial
value," Rosteva said.
Koteva added that the Uni-
versity would not necessarily be
opposed to a proposal, should
one be on the table.
"Our door is always open to our
conversations."

Legislative misfire
Michigan Republicans want concealed weapons in schools
Gun control has become a legislative focus in past months
since the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy. President
Barack Obamahas started pushing through the most exten-
sive changes in gun control in recent decades. He has asked Congress
to approve an assault rifle ban as well as background checks on all gun
buyers. However, it seems that Michigan's Republicans have decided
to move in a different direction to stop mass shootings and increase
school safety. Legislators are proposing a bill that would allow teach-
ers, administrators and other school employees to carry concealed
hand guns on school property. Michigan's schools and legislature-
should focus on other measures of increasing school safety instead of
simply handing minimally trained school officials weapons.

Reactionary k

This bill aims to prevent school shootings,
which have become a tragic fixture of our
nation. Michigan House Speaker Jase Bolger,
a supporter of this bill, said "I don't think it's a
coincidence that such monsters that are carry-
ing these out are going to gun-free zones to do
their massacre," according to an article in the
Petoskey News. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder
vetoed a similar bill at the end of the 2012 leg-
islature, directly after Sandy Hook, citing the
fact that schools, day cares and churches have
a legal right to ban firearms if they see fit. The
new billwould allow teachers and other school
officials to carry concealed handguns, but
legislators have added a clause that would let
schools maintain a firearms ban if they wish.
School safety expands beyond the trag-
edies such as Sandy Hook, Columbine High
School and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University. While these are the stories
that make the news, they're extremely hard
to prevent with any type of legislation. Mass
shootings are the exception, but student-on-
student or student-on-teacher violence is the
bigger problem in many schools. There are
many other measures that could be enacted
to increase safety in schools, none of which
involve supplying teachers with firearms.
Securing exits by requiring visitors to sign in
and submit to a pat down is one way of pre-

venting unwanted people or weapons on cam-
pus. But, we must remember that no policy,
however strict, can prevent every act of evil.
Schools are supposed to encourage learning
and the betterment of one's self. Students are
unable to learn ina stressful or unsafe environ-
ment. The idea that any teacher could be con-
cealing a gun doesn't make for an comfortable
place to learn. It's not the job of administrator
or teacher to protect students from an unlike-
ly violent attack using a firearm. Their focus
should be on education in the classroom, not all
the possible threats outside of it. The best way
to decrease violence in schools is to increase
the student body's investment. After-school
programs, sports and school spirit have all been
shown to decrease violence. Investing in coun-
selors and spurring teacher engagement can
prevent violence, but is more closely tied to the
main goal of any educational institution.
Gun control needs to be addressed, and
legislation to reduce mass shootings should
be on the floors of Congress. However, there
are other and more effective measures than
what this particular bill proposes. Snyder's
veto of a similar bill last year shows that he,
too, thinks there needs to be a change in how
we prevent violence. We shouldn't be teach-
ing students to fight violence with violence,
especially in schools.

teacher once told me that
our government only acts in
response to a terrible event
and that the
true goal of the
U.S. government
isn't necessarily
to be proactive,
but effectively
reactive.
Perhaps thish
mantra is true
for what Ameri- PATRICK
ca was supposed MAILLET
to be - for what
our forefathers
truly envisioned as a more perfect
union. But unfortunately, in the
dawn of the limitless campaign fun-
draising age, where bipartisanship
is a surefire way to be unelectable,
our government no longer runs on
reactive logic, but instead on out-
of-touch political idealism perfectly
structured in order for politicians to
remain in power.
Seventy-two days ago, 26 inno-
cent people were slaughtered in
Newtown as a result of government
negligence and a lack of logic.
I must admit, when I first heard
about the shooting in Newtown,
Conn. I said to the friend who had
told me of event, "How many were
killed this time?" The moment the
words came out of my mouth, I felt a
sickness within my body. How have
we come to the point as a society
where we simply expect these types
of ruthless acts of aggression to be a
normal event and that there's noth-
ing that can be done to prevent them?
Immediately following the mas-
sacre, like many other gun-control
advocates, I was pleased to see the
possibility of actual legislation
being passed that would help pre-
vent future gun violence.
Now, I am unfortunately being
brought back to reality.
President Barack Obama's origi-
nal response to the Newtown
shooting was a plan based upon four
core elements: require background
checks for gun owners, institute
an assault weapons ban, limit the
size of ammunition magazines, and
conduct further research on mental

health disorders and their relation-
ship with gun violence.
Simply put, these responses
are logical: They make sense, and
they're the essence of how a reac-
tive government should function.
After all, if you possess an instru-
ment capable of causing mass
death, shouldn't the government
make sure you're capable of han-
dling such a responsibility? Why do
"sportsmen" need a weapon power-
ful enough to rapidly shoot at a rate
of fire necessary only in combat?
How could a hunter possibly need
a 100-round magazine for anything
involving legal activities? And why
wouldn't we look into the mental
sicknesses that have caused count-
less mentally ill people to kill scores
of innocent civilians?
For as simple as these ques-
tions may seem, they apparently
are all too unconstitutional to even
bring up with regards to gun con-
trol. Luckily, it appears that two
of the four core elements will pass
through Congress: background
checks and mental health research.
But even these weren't passed
uncontested by the National Rifle
Association. Wayne LaPierre, CEO
and executive vice president of
the NRA, argued that background
checks hurt small gun sellers
Regardless, these two elements of
gun control seem likely to pass.
Unfortunately, an assault weap-
ons ban and a limit on magazine
size seem increasingly unlikely as
both Democrats and Republicans
begin to balk at the concept of lim-
iting gun ownership and thereby be
labeled an anti-gun legislator.
Obama reiterated his support for
gun reform in his State of the Union
Tuesday night, yet even then he
refused to mention assault weap-
ons by name and instead referred to
"weapons of war." This has a lot to
do with many Congressional Demo-
crats revealing they would not sup-
port the president in fighting for an
assault weapons ban. Weapons like
the AR-15, used by James Holmes
in Aurora; commonly referred to
by sportsmen as a "spray and pray"
assault rifle, will almost certainly

gic
remain legal within the foreseeable
future.
Although I was disappointed by
Obama's lack of acknowledgement
toward an assault weapons ban, he
at least honed in on the importance
of gun control and made it a vital
piece of his speech. Conversely, in
the Republican response to Obama's
speech, Florida Republican Sen.
Marco Rubio dedicated a whopping
11 seconds togun control and, in fact,
didn't even mention the word "gun."
1774 people have
been killed in the last
63 days as a result of
gun violence.

Instead, Rubio stated, "We must
effectively deal with the rise of vio-
lence in our country, but unconsti-
tutionally undermining the second
amendment rights of law-abiding
Americans is not the way to do it."
Wow, I'm sure that's just what the
parents of Newtown, Aurora and
countless other gun victims want to
hear from their elected officials.
In the past 72 days, approximate-
ly 1,774 people have been killed
in the United States as a result of
gun violence. These people are the
true victims of Newtown, because
instead of learning from our mis-
takes and reacting accordingly, our
government has remained stagnant
and has allowed continuous inno-
cent bloodshed. How many more
massacres will it take for us to final-
ly wake up and realize that maybe
a society with 300 million privately
owned firearms is not sustainable?
We have to startusing logic when
forming our gun policy. If not, and
if we do not react accordingly to the
deaths of 26 innocent children and
teachers in Newtown, then they
will have died in vain and we will
have no one to blame but ourselves.

MISHARA DAVIS I
My semester ln Detroit


I first encountered the Semester in Detroit
program during Assistant Prof. Stephen Ward's
freshman seminar on Malcolm X. Even after
taking classes focused on Detroit, I believed I
could expand my knowledge of the city. As a
Detroiter, Cass Technical High School alum,
member of Detroit NAACP and precinct del-
egate, I seized the opportunity to experience
Detroit through the lens of an SID student. So
far, the program has exceeded my expectations.
When I first began the program this semes-
ter, I thought I knew everything about the city.
Was Iwrong? Duringtours in southwest, north-
west and downtown Detroit, I discovered ele-
ments of the city I never knew existed. I saw
black churches on the east side that survived
the threat of demolition during redevelopment
in the 1950s. I saw modern senior citizen liv-
ing complexes near Cass Corridor. I saw the
industriallandscapes of Ford automotive plants
throughout the city and in Hamtramck. And I
continue to see new things each week - in my
courses and at my internship.
In my SID seminars on urban planning,
Detroit history and internship reflection, I
feel as if I am on a journey. I move from the
turn of the 20th century to the climax of the
automotive industry - where race and class
played such a large role in American life - to

Detroit's future. My reflection seminar helps
me conceptualize current events in the city
and offers insight on how the Detroit Future
City framework will focus on the economy
and may work to sustain the city for the next
50 years. To process it all, I engage with com-
munity members at monthly Detroit Speaker
Series events, where panelists and the public
discuss the city.
At my community-based internship, I
encounter reoccurring themes from Detroit's
history, such as urban redevelopment. I have
the honor to work alongside attorneys at the
American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan
- a non-profit legal reform organization that
strives to protect and expand the rights guar-
anteed to us by the Constitution. I review
prospective cases and help determine if a
complaint violates the client's Constitutional
rights. This legal perspective, coupled with
courses on the history of Detroit, enrich my
experience in the program.
I could tell you all about my time in SID,
but the best way to gain a full experience of
Semester in Detroit is to apply. The applica-
tion deadline for spring is March 1. Learn

Next to a daycare is one of the best
places to live. Sure, being woken
up in the morning by the sounds
of shrieking children isn't the best
alarm clock, but it's worth it for the
5:30 p.m. pick-up when I get to see
parents reunite with their children.
On the day of the Sandy Hook Ele-
mentary School shooting I watched
more than one family grab their
children a little tighter and carry
them out of this Ann Arbor daycare:
The whole parking lot seemed tense
as parents surelythought about how
lucky they were to hold their pre-
cious ones safe from harm.
After the horrors of Sandy Hook,
we all must now look at the avail-
able options to protect children in
school. The Michigan Protection
Act, recently suggested by State
Sen. Mike Green (R-Huron), would
give schools the autonomyto choose
whether teachers and administra-
tors could carry concealed weap-
ons on school property. All school
grounds are currently deemed
"gun-free zones," making them
highly susceptible to gun violence,
such as the shootings we've seen at
Columbine High School, Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State
University, Sandy Hook, Elemen-
tary School and others. If attack-
ers know there's no way for people
to defend themselves on school

grounds, it makes the attack seem
more attractive.
While the act goes too far in
allowing teachers to carry weap-
ons, it brings up a valid idea about
keeping schools safe. Instead of
allowing every teacher or adminis-
trator to carry a concealed weapon,
public schools should train admin-
istrators and individuals in public
school offices how to use a handgun
in self-defense. The weapons should
be kept locked in a small gun safe
under a desk in a central adminis-
tration office so that in case of an
emergency, trained officials can
defend the school. On the day of the
Sandy Hook massacre, Dawn Hoch-
sprung, the heroic principal, went
out into the hallway and "lunged
toward the shooter in an attempt
to overtake him before being fatally
shot," according to a Daily Beast
article. If Hochsprung had a gun
when she went out into the hallway
to try and overtake the shooter, we
might be mourning the loss of far
fewer people today.
Some argue that administrators
aren't police officers and there-
fore shouldn't have to be trained
in shooting a weapon, but that's a
naive attitude. Unfortunately, we
live in a world where gun violence
in schools exists. While it's unfortu-
nate that we have to prepare for the

worst, isn't it best that we be pre-
pared? It's expensive for all public
schools to have an on-duty police
officer on campus grounds every
day, and it's not an effective use of
tax dollars in communities with low
in-school violence, such as Newton,
Conn. The Sandy Hook massacre
goes to show that gun attacks can
happen anywhere. It would be a
good use of our tax dollars to train
select administrators on how to use
a weapon if necessary. Every school
should have a hidden weapon,
locked away and only used in - God
forbid - emergency circumstances.
Sandy Hook Elementary had
recently implemented new security
measures before the attack. None of
them proved to be useful. When an
attacker wants to get into the build-
ing, he or she will do it. The question
is: How will we protect our children
once the shooter is inside? Will we
continue to keep gun-free zones
where self-defense is impossible?
Or will we take a proactive stance
and train administrators to strike if
necessary? I know if anyone in my
family had been a victim that day
-I would want the best self-defense
strategy in place to prevent future
families from having to experience
the same.

"Back that thang up ... but watch out for ride-ons."
Confessions Of
'Arrested' nays

The five steps of
coping with Bluth
O complacency
By ELLIOT ALPERN
Senior Arts Editor
Look, I know that the chances
are, if you've decided to read this
article, you're ready to curse my
name. I get it. "Arrested Develop-
ment," the cult phenomenon and
six-time Emmy winner, is almost
universally accepted as a TV clas-
sic. Even IGN called it the "fun-
niest show of all time." Nobody
dislikes "AD."
Except ... well, me.
I'm not here to throw low blows
at a series commonly understood
as one of the best of the decade.
And I certainly don't think that
I'mthe sane one percent in a world
swept away by the Bluths and co.
I mean, the cast alone - a pre-
fame Michael Cera and an in-his-
prime Jason Bateman, along with
David Cross, Jeffrey Tambor, Will
Arnett, etc. - is enough to make it
worth watching.
To be fair, I don't really hate
"Arrested."If friends are watching,
I'll watch with them, often chuck-
ling at some of the same scenes.
But, even with Netflix's archive
of "Arrested Development" at my
disposal, I've never, not once, felt
an urge to watch another episode.
And that's after watching more
than a season and a half.
I have no idea why the show
never appealed to me, when my
friends have very correctly point-
ed out that my other favorite com-
edies ("Workaholics," "Archer,"
"It's Always Sunny") often go
hand-in-hand with fans of the
resurrected classic. But, for what-
ever reason, I've never felt a con-
nection to any of the characters
- not Tobias, Michael or George
Michael, consistent hooks with

other "AD" watchers.
And let me tell you, it hasn't
beeneasylivingwithsuch anopin-
ion. Early on in my relationship,
my girlfriend casually mentioned
that she didn't think she could
ever date someone who didn't like
"Arrested Development." Suffice it
to say, I held my tongue.
But after close to a year and
a half, I couldn't quite keep the
secret, and we've had an unspo-
ken "don't bring it up" agreement
regarding the show ever since.
There's nothing we can do to rem-
edy the situation - it's her favorite
show, and when I'm silent during
the "funniest" moments, tension
tends to arise.
In fact, even mentioning the
thought of writing this article
turned into a minor skirmish -
not an article that bashed the
show, but simply an article admit-
tingI didn't like it. "Arrested" fans
can't comprehend how it doesn't
appeal, just like Ican't understand
how"Workaholics" or "It's Always
Sunny" don't appeal to larger audi-
ences. We're all fan-boys of our
favorite shows.
The argument is always eerily
similar to the Five Stages of Grief,
as represented by the mini-argu-
mentwith my girlfriend.
1. Denial
"Yeah, but how many episodes
have you even watched?"
Admittedly, not as many epi-
sodes as any other person I've spo-
ken with on the subject. But, after
a season and a half of no appeal, I
think it's safe to say that I'm not a
fan.
2. Anger
"You didn't want to like it before
you even watched it! You're such a
devil's advocate."
It's the exact opposite. I genu-
inely want to like this show - I

Dandruff free, bitches.
Where are you, Nicole?

By GREGORY HICKS
Daily Arts Writer
Nicole Scherzinger. If this
name doesn't call up any familiar-
ity, that's only expected, given the
generous (and dynamic) number
of Pussycat Doll members. It's no
secret, however, that Scherzinger
is essentially the only musical
contribution to the best-selling
girl group.
What's missing from a Wright
State University musical theatre
major with a minor in dance, a
lead singer for a best-selling group
and an exquisite appearance that
turns heads worldwide? A solo
career fits snugly into this unfin-
ished puzzle, and not the pseudo-
solo career of a Pussycat Dolls
frontwoman.
Her Name Is Nicole
Interestingly enough, will.i.am
wanted the Hawaiian pop per-
former as the female member of
the Black Eyed Peas, but record-
ing contracts hampered this
contingency, and BEP settled on
Fergie instead.
Scherzinger's musical objec-
tive didn't include being lost in
an ensemble, so the singer com-
menced scheming a solo career
almost immediately after joining
PCD. Only a year after the release
of the Dolls's debut album, PCD,
Scherzinger finished many of the
tracks for her own debut record
Her Name Is Nicole, an abbrevi-
ated version of the original title
Nobody Knows Who I Am So Here
Is MyName.
Scherzinger's second indepen-
dent single, "Baby Love," became
an international top-20 hit, but a
predicament arose. "Baby Love"
(and every other song prepared
for Her Name Is Nicole) was
essentially a Pussycat Dolls track
released under a new name. In
fact, when the ill-fated solo art-
ist scrapped this debut album, a
majority of its material appeared

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
By the time the weekend is
over, the No. 14 Michigan softball
team will have made two trips to
Florida, logged 18 hours of flight
time, taken on eight opponents
and played in three doublehead-
ers in just nine days. Fresh off a
3-1 record during the first week-
end of the season, the Wolverines
return to the Sunshine State this
weekend to take on Toledo, LIU
Brooklyn, Maryland and Massa-
chusetts in the FAU Kickoff Clas-
sic in Boca Raton.
Highlights of the opening
weekend included 23 innings
on the mound from sophomore
pitcher Sara Driesenga, along
with an offensive spark from

freshman shortstop Sierra Rome-
ro. Romero's two home runs
- which included a grand slam -
and nine RBI earned her Big Ten

O'Neill said.

A chance to end a five-
year streak vs. Spartans

Michigan has lost
20 of previous
21 games against
Michigan State
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
And just like that, the Wolver-
ines are back on track.
The Michigan women's basket-
ball team got off to its best start in
program history this-season. But
after starting 4-0 in conference
play, things began to falter and
the Wolverines
(7-4 Big Ten, Michigan
18-6 overall)
lost four of five VS. MSU
games. Matchup:

"People don't
come in here and win at Purdue,"
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico then. "For us to be able to
come in here and do that, espe-
cially after beating Illinois, and
follow it up with this win, it says a
lot about our program and where
we are now."
Senior forward Kate Thomp-
son led the way and finally busted
out of a long shooting slump, hit-

ting six 3-pointers against the
Boilermakers. She now has the
program record for 3-pointers in
a season with 91. The Wolverines'
win over Purdue was their first
victory over a ranked opponent
this season, and it has given them
a lot of confidence.
But now it's time for Michigan
to face Michigan State (7-4, 19-5).
Again. Only 12 days have passed
since these two teams squared
off in East Lansing, and yet, this
Michigan squad is very different.
"We just got back to playing
together more as a unit," Thomp-
son said. "We have to bring that
(intensity) against (the Spat-
tans)."
Added senior forward Nya Jor-
dan: "We just need be to ready to
play. I think our last Michigan
State game we weren't ready to
play, so if we can use the same
energy we had in (the Purdue)
game and carry it over to the
Michigan State game, we'll defi-
nitely win thatgame."
Last time these two teams
met, the Wolverines were held to
32.1-percent shooting and went
just 3-for-20 from beyond the arc.
Jordan was the lone bright spot
for Michigan, recording a dou-
ble-double with 12 points and 10
rebounds.
The same five starters.for the
Wolverines will be on the floor as
last time, but this time, Michigan
hopes the 3-pointers will fall for
Thompson. The plan says senior
guard Jenny Ryan will make
the extra pass, and senior center
Rachel Sheffer will hit the low
post shots.

It's been five years since the
Wolverines have topped the Spar-
tans in Ann Arbor, and they have
dropped 20 of their last 21 con-
tests against them.
"We always talk about playing
with emotion, but not emotion-
ally," Barnes Arico said. "Some-
times against Michigan State I
think we get caught up a little
bit. We've got to make sure we've
not looking at the front of their
jerseys and just make sure we're
looking to improve on the last two
games and be prepared for Satur-
day."
In a season filled of program
bests, it's the perfect opportunity
for Michigan to add some heat to
a rivalry that has been very one-
sided. The Wolverines are coming
off their longest break this sea-
son, having last played six days
ago. Meanwhile, 'the Spartans
played Indiana on Wednesday.
"Michigan State is just a very
talented team," Thompson said.
"They play good defense, and
offensively, they have so many
threats. It's going to be huge to
come out strong against them."
Junior guard Klarissa Bell,
who averages 1L8 points and six
rebounds per game, leads the
Spartans. After Bell, Michigan
State does not have any other
double-digit scorers, but it has six
players that average more than
seven points each.
"(This) is going to be a huge
game for us," Thompson said.
"We really need to take (this) one.
It's going to be at home, so it's
going to be good to play in front of
our home crowd again."

Freshman goalie Jared Rutledge is still one of a handful of Wolverines, four now, in contention for She starting job.
For ', goalie is stil
toughest question'

Berenson prefers
one goalie for CCHA
Tournament but no
one has emerged
By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingSports Editor
Despite all the soft goals the
Michigan hockey team's net-
minders have allowed this sea-
son, coach Red Berenson has
kept up hope that one would
emerge as his go-to guy.
Berenson's always been a
one-goalie coach and he knows
that the constant uncertain-
ty surrounding the position
doesn't help.
"That's been the difficulty
all year, getting a consistent
go-to goalie, and it's hard for
the goalies," Berenson said.
"They could easily make the
point that, 'I'm just getting a
few games under my belt, and
they pull me.' But I want to see
a goalie that gives us a chance
to win and I'll play him every
night. That's been our history
here, but we haven't had that
goalie this year."
With four games remaining
before the CCHA playoffs, and
with desperation having set in
months ago, Berenson seems
ready to use the opportunity
to give his fourth goalie a shot
- redshirt sophomore Luke
Dwyer.
"Dwyer is in the picture

Sutton said. "I'm proud to say
I'm starting, or at least helping to
start, a program at such a presti-
gious school."
Johnson echoed this feeling of
pride for both his teammates but
also the University. Both play-
ers are looking to raise the bar in
terms of expectations and per-
formance and to start competing
with the likes of Johns Hopkins
and Ohio State - two of the elite
programs in the country.
"What that means is setting a
higher standard," Johnson said.
"It means that this year losing to
North Carolina 19-5 isn't accept-
able, in any realm. As a leader, I
am setting a very'high bar for
myself and holding my team-
mates to that standard."
Looking ahead at their second
game and beyond, the Wolverines
are prepared and poised to be a
strong opponent. This weekend,
they take on Bellarmine in Lou-
isville, Kent. Michigan lost to the
Knights, 13-9, last year in the Big
House.
"We're really confident going
into this game," Sutton said.
"We've scrimmaged them every
year since I've been here, and we
know they're a good team. We're
going to prepare well, and we
know we're going to have to con-
trol the tempo, but we know what
they like to do."

Michigan has
lost consecu-

it lost six consecutive games in
the middle of the 2011 season.
But this weekend, the Wolver-
ines (8-4 Big Ten, 21-4 overall)
welcome a team to the Crisler
Center that knows a thing or two
about mounting losses. Big Ten
bottom feeder Penn State has lost
each of its 11 conference games
and has yet to win a game on the
road this season. The Nittany
Lions (0-11, 8-15) haven't beaten
a BCS conference opponent all
year, and their last Big Ten win
came on Feb. 16, 2012.
After Tuesday night's embar-
rassing 75-52 loss at Michigan
State, the Wolverines should

have plenty of motivation.
"We just preached the impor-
tance of staying together," said
redshirt junior Jordan Morgan.
"Things like this happen, so you
can't stay down on it. ... You get
all these numbers, all these rank-
ings, but at the end of the day,
that doesn't really mean much
when we step out there. Other
teams don'treally care about that
stuff."
With the regular season finale
less than a month away, junior
guard Tim Hardaway Jr., who
said Tuesday night was a reality
check, found another cause to
rally around.
"We've got to play for the
guys next to us, because it's our
seniors' last year here, and right
now, we're not playing for them
these last few games," Hardaway
said.
Sunday's game has been
tabbed as the Crisler Center
Rededication. In its honor, the
team will wear retro jerseys,
commemorating the 1968 team
that played in the arena's inau-
gural season. Though the white
retro uniforms won't include the
belt or short shorts of the origi-
nals, a press release called the
jerseys "identical."
The athletic department has
planned a ribbon-cutting cere-
mony outside Crisler prior to the
game, and inside, the University
is hoping for a "Stripe Out," with
alternating sections donning
either maize or blue.
Sophomore point guard Trey
Burke, who struggled with foul
trouble against the Spartans,

should have hisway against Penn
State. The All-American, who
once verbally committed to the
Nittany Lions, averaged 16 points
against Penn State last year. But
last season, Burke was matched
up against All-Big Ten defender
Tim Frazier. Frazier was lost for
the year earlierthis season with a
ruptured Achilles tendon. Guard
D.J. Newbill, who transferred to
Penn State this year, leads the
team in scoring at 15.8 points
per game but turns the ball over
nearly four times per game.
Out of 345 Division-I basket-
ball teams, the Nittany Lions
rank 343rd in assists (nine per
game), 339th in field goal per-
centage (.381) and 316th in points
per game (60.3).
Even if Sunday's game turns
into a blowout, there are two
major storylines to pay attention
to.
Morgan, who sprained his
ankle at Illinois on Jan. 27, has
yet to play more than nine min-
utes in a game since.
"It's better," Morgan said on
Tuesday. "I'm pretty close (to 100
percent), I'm right there."
Second, even though forward
Glenn Robinson III's minutes
haven't taken a hit, the forward's
production has - significantly
diminished. Robinson has aver-
aged just 4.5 points in his last
four games and has appeared
afraid to shoot.
"All our guys need to get back
to some basics ... to improve their
own game, and he's not alone in
that," said Michigan coach John
Beilein.

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
On Sunday, Michigan will
play host to Penn State, which
has yet to win a conference
game this season. In fact, the
Nittany Lions haven't won since
Dec. 29.
Second-year head coach
Pat Chambers, one of the Big
Ten's most
energetic *
es, has
struggled
to find
offense
after los-
ing senior point guard Tim Fra-
zier to a season-ending injury
during non-conference play.
The preseason-All Big Ten first
team guard wasn't just the focal
point of the offense, he was also
one of the conference's best
perimeter defenders.
The Daily chatted with
Chambers in October at Big Ten
media day, when the coach had
just as many wins in conference
play as he does now.
The Michigan Daily: After
winning12 games last year, how
do you manage expectations?
Pat Chambers: What I told
them, we've just got to be the
best team we can be. Wheth-
er that's 20 wins, 18 wins, 16
wins or 12, be the best team we
can be, come out and compete
every day, continue to work
hard on developing great hab-
its to give us an opportunity to
win. I don't think many people
thought we were going to win
12 games (last season), let alone
four in the Big Ten. I think we
surprised a lot of people, and I
think that's a tribute to these
kids. They didn't know they
were supposed to lose by 40.
They had a different midnset
and wanted to give us a chance.
It says a lot about them.
TMD: Obviously the foot-
ball program is facing an
uphill battle with its sanctions.
Does that open a void for you,
maybe, where even Penn State
fans might not have otherwise
looked at Penn State basketball?
PC: What I would say to that
question is that we can help
during the process. But I don't
know if void is the right word

Michigan's disappearing act

GOING
TO THE

adies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, children
of all ages, gather 'round
and get your tickets because
traveling to an arena near you is
the Michigan men's basketball
team - performers of the best
magic show in the Midwest.
That's what I feel like I've been
watching, as the Wolverines have
dropped three of their past four
games during the last 11 days - a
great, big magic show.
The performance is quite sim-
ple: The Wol- _
verines get up
on a bigstage,
run around,
wave their
arms around
for awhile,
and then,
voila - just STEVEN
like that, the BRAID
Wolverines
are gone.
Sometimes they make them-
selves disappear for the first five
or 10 minutes of the show. And
at other times, you'll even get to
see them disappear for a full 20
minutes of game time. But on
Tuesday, they performed their
best magic show yet, vahishing
for a full game against Michigan
State. They disappeared so quick-
ly that I'm not even sure that they
showed up to the Breslin Center
in the first place.
What's the trick? Two words:
Passive play. F
An inability to draw fouls and
get to the free-throw line has
plagued the Wolverines and has
been one of the biggest reasons
for their midseason mini-swoon.
And unless they start looking for
contact and playing with more

aggression, the losses will keep
coming, especially on the road.
Michigan is the worst team in
the Big Ten at gettingto the foul
line. Its 378 attempts from the
line place it dead last. Go ahead
and digest that for a moment.
The Wolverines shoot fewer
free throws than Penn State, a
team winless in the Big Ten, and
Nebraska, ateam that doesn't
even average 60 points a game.
But forget about the Big Ten,
Michigan ranks as one of the
worst teams in the country in
that category. According to
TeamRankings.com - a site that
computes stats for games involv-
ing two NCAA Division I schools
- the Wolverines are one of the
least-fouled teams in the country.
Of 347 Division I schools, the
Wolverines rank 342nd in draw-
ing fouls. Their 14.7 fouls drawn
per game place them squarely
between Troy and Louisiana-
Monroe. Their 15 free-throw
attempts per game place them in
the bottom 15 in the nation, and
their lack of aggression has really
caught up with them during the
past three road games.
In the first 21 games of the sea-
son, the Wolverines attempted
over 16 free throws a game. In
the current three-game road los-
ing streak, the Wolverines have
attempted a combined total of 15
shots from the charity stripe.
You'll say that's nonsense, that
those stats don't mean anything.
That the reason the Wolverines
have lost three of their last four
games is because they play in the
toughest conference and when
you play on the road in three of
the toughest arenas in the coun-
try, you're going to lose, espe-

cially when you play four games
in 11 days.
And I'll still say, just look at
the numbers. I'll point to an
eight-point loss to Indiana 11 days
ago, in which Michigan shot just
seven free throws; the Hoosiers
took 25. I'll direct you to the
three-point overtime loss against
Wisconsin on Saturday, during
which the Wolverines attempted
two free throws for the entire
game. I repeat, they took two free
throws the entire game (the Bad-
gers attempted 10 free throws).
And then I'll show you Tues-
day night. While Michigan State
dominated the contest, Michigan
attempted six free throws - half
of which came in the final 90 sec-
onds of the game by players who
normally never seea minute of
game time.
You'll ask how the heck can a
few morefree throws change the
'ourse of a 23-point blowout. I'd
partially agree with you. At face
value, a few more free throws
wouldn't have made much of a
dent in the deficit, but the lack of
free-throw attempts was indica-
tive of Michigan's passive play.
The mere fact of creating fouls
and getting to the foul line early
in the contest would've estab-
lished a physical presence for
the Wolverines, and could've put
Michigan State in foul trouble -
potential altering the outcome.
Not one Spartan accumulated
more than three fouls on Tues-
day. In fact, no opposing player
has racked up more than three
fouls against the Wolverines
since Illinois' center Nnanna
Egwu on Jan. 27 - a stretch of
six games.
You'll say Michigan needs to

get Glenn Robinson III more
involved, he's only scored eight
points in those three games. I'll
say Robinson needs to get him-
self more involved, he's not being
aggressive enough. Total number
of foul shots attempted in those
three road games: zero. But he's
not alone, Tim Hardaway Jr. and
Mitch McGary have combined
for zero free-throw attempts dur-
ing that stretch, aswell.
Yes, the case can be made
that Michigan is playing tougher
competition and that it's a finesse
team. That it's not built to shoot
20-plus free throws every game.
But the Wolverines are also not
designed to win attempting just
five free throws a contest, either.
They can create high totals from
the charity stripe, as they've
demonstrated in quality wins
against Kansas State (13), North
Carolina State (20), Arkansas (18)
-and Minnesota (25),
Before its loss to Indiana,
Michigan had attempted single-
digit free throws in a game just
once - a 28-point victory against
Binghamton in December.
Since then, the Wolverines have
attempted fewer than 10 free
throws just three times, and it's
no coincidence that they've all
come in the past three losses.
There's an old adage that says
you can afford to shoot 3-pointers
at home, but you've got to shoot
free throws if you want to win on
the road.
Michigan should heed the
advice, or else its next magic
trick will be an earlyexit in the
postseason.
