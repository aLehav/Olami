Renovation concludes 
multi-year initiative 
to update housing

 on campus

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Shuttered for renovations over 

the last year, the West Quadran-
gle Residence Hall held an official 
reopening 
ceremony 
Wednes-

day afternoon — with University 
President Mark Schlissel and E. 
Royster Harper, vice president of 
student life, helping cut the blue 
ribbon.

When Schlissel addressed the 

crowd, he marveled at the hall’s 
renovated features.

“Man, I’m jealous,” he said.
West Quad’s opening marks 

the latest in a series of projects 
launched a decade ago to improve 
housing on campus. West Quad is 
now the eighth residence hall to 
receive renovations through the 

multi-million dollar Residential 
Life Initiative launched by former 
University President Mary Sue 
Coleman in 2004. The initiative 
also initiated the construction of 
North Quad as well as dining cen-
ters on Central Campus and in the 
Hill campus neighborhood.

At Wednesday’s opening cere-

mony, University officials praised 
the designers, architects, housing 
staff, contractors and engineers 
for their work on the renova-
tion, which focused on upgrad-
ing the building technologically 

and improving spaces dedicated 
to diversity and inclusion, while 
keeping the historic feel of the 
hall.

West Quad was originally con-

structed in 1937 and was funded 
by the Works Progress Adminis-
tration of President Roosevelt’s 
New Deal program. Harper said 
it was important to University 
administration to maintain the 
building’s original look.

ovations almost a decade ago 

New model aims to 
tailor resources to 
individual schools, 
reach more students

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

The University’s Counseling 

and Psychological Services is 
increasingly embedding counsel-
ors in individual schools and col-
leges — and the office reports the 
initiative is working.

CAPS Director Dr. Todd Sevig 

said the “embedded model,” 
originally piloted through simi-
lar services at Northwestern 
University and the University of 
Iowa, was launched last year in 
response to a growing number of 
students seeking mental health 
services.

The CAPS 2014-2015 annual 

report said the office experi-
enced a 17 percent increase in 
demand for services during the 
2014-2015 academic year.

“Our goal is to increase sup-

port, but not just to increase by 
doing the same old thing,” Sevig 
said. “We really wanted to grow 
in this new way, and that new 
way is a direct, local service 
delivery, local meeting within 
that particular place. And it also 
meets the needs of the schools 
and colleges.”

Sevig said the ability to tailor 

resources to a specific school or 
college’s culture is part of what 
makes the embedded model so 
successful.

“It’s the combination of these 

two things: it’s the ability to tai-
lor, but then those decisions are 
from a staff member who knows 
intimately the culture of that 
place and has worked with stu-
dents from that particular place, 
has worked with faculty from 
that particular place,” he said.

The first phase of the model, 

launched in July 2014, assigned 
three counselors to the four 
North Campus schools and col-
leges — Art & Design, Architec-
ture and Urban Planning, Music, 

Doctors say 

initiative will likely 

expand to other 
transplant types

By TOM MCBRIEN

Daily Staff Reporter

Amputees who have lost their 

hands may now have the chance 
to write, use a telephone and 
grasp objects again, thanks to a 
new transplant program at the 
University of Michigan Health 
System.

The procedure, referred to as 

a “vascular composite allograft 
transplantation,” involves reat-
taching multiple types of tis-
sue such as fat, skin, muscle and 
nerve cells. Patients accepted into 
the program will receive hands 
from recently deceased donors.

The surgery is intense. It 

requires a team of 10 to 30 doc-
tors depending on the complex-
ity of each individual case, and 

it lasts eight to 12 hours — com-
pared to an average of four hours 
for a heart transplant.

John Magee, transplant sur-

geon and director of the Trans-
plant Center, said UMHS is 
well-positioned to offer the sur-
gery.

“The University of Michi-

gan re-attaches more limbs per 
week than most people would 
think,” Magee said. “The hand 
effort builds upon a great deal 
of strength we already have, and 
the other efforts will build upon 
the successes we see with hand 
transplants.”

The 
University 
already 

received approval to expand the 
program in the future, meaning 
it could soon be performing other 
VCA surgeries such as face trans-
plants. According to Magee, how-
ever, those won’t come until after 
the program is comfortable with 
hand transplants.

“A central issue, of course, is 

making sure we are successful 
and that we go about this in a 

Deli CEO’s model 

draws lessons 
from anarchist 

pamphlets, activists 

By JULIA LISS

Daily Staff Reporter

With 33 years under his belt 

as the CEO of Zingerman’s Deli-
catessen and the Zingerman’s 
Community of Businesses, Ari 
Weinzweig, the deli’s co-found-
er, shared his unique approach 

to business with about 45 Ann 
Arbor community members on 
Wednesday night.

The event, held in the Hatch-

er Graduate Library, was part 
of the Zingerman’s ZingTrain 
series, in which Weinzweig 
teaches his business philosophy 
to companies and organizations. 
Wednesday’s talk focused on the 
connections between anarchism 
and creative business models.

The concept promotes sev-

eral tenets, including a focus 
on reducing hierarchy, bringing 
out the best in every member 
of the organization and teach-

ing everyone to lead. He also 
emphasized 
encouraging 
an 

environment characterized by 
openness and positivity.

“You can’t have a healthy 

business in an unhealthy eco-
system,” he said.

Weinzweig 
outlined 
the 

several core beliefs he uses to 
run his business. He noted the 
importance of giving people 
the freedom to innovate and do 
good, rather than telling them 
what to do.

inspiration from a collection of

The second Republican pres-

day, and the discussion largely 
steered clear of education and 
manufacturing — topics that 
have been the focus of politi-

recent months.

Aaron Kall, director of the 

University’s debate program, 
said though a question on man-

the prime time show was dic-

anarchist pamphlets and social 
protest primary sources housed 
in the University Library’s Joseph 
A. Labadie Collection. As part of 
the series, Weinzweig is launch-
ing his own series of pamphlets 
which promote the Zingerman’s 
business model.

During the talk, he read quotes 

from noted anarchists like Emma 
Goldman and Peter Koestenbaum 
with the aim of correcting mis-
conceptions about anarchism.

“The popular perception of 

anarchism is chaos, but it’s not,” 
Weinzweig said. “It’s just about 
freely chosen organization.”

He also said many people see 

anarchism as calling for the over-
throw of all leadership. For him, 
that’s not the right way to think 
of it.

“Leaders earn the right to lead 

by having content expertise and 
leading with integrity so people 
want them to lead,” Weinzweig 
said.

Weinzweig served as half of the 

team that gave the University’s 
commencement speech in May 
2015. He, along with Zingerman’s 
co-founder Paul Saginaw empha-
sized generosity to graduates. 

“I believe that going for great-

ness — greatness for you and not 
how everyone else in the world 
identifies it — is energizing,” 
Weinzweig said in May.

some of our buildings were, well, 
there’s historic and then there’s 
antiquated,” Harper said. “Some 
of our buildings were definitely 
on the antiquated side.”

While the nearly 75-year-old 

original tile floors were kept, air 
conditioning was added, as well as 
a new creative suite and improved 
study spaces. The multicultural 
room was relocated and updated.

LSA senior Amanda Cham-

pagne, a West Quad residential 
adviser, lived in the dorm her 
freshman year as well and said 
the improvements reflect the 
needs of the students.

“As students, academics are 

our first priority, and they made 
sure to make that their prior-
ity as well by creating all of these 
awesome spaces for students to 
study,” Champagne said. “You 
can really tell that the renovations 
were made with the needs of resi-
dents in mind.”

The updated building is over 

30 percent more energy efficient 
than code standards require.

Schlissel said improving build-

ings on campus will encourage 
more people to apply to the Uni-
versity.

“Now I look at what we can 

provide in terms of accommoda-
tions for our students and I can’t 
wait to have a campus tour start 
walking through here,” Schlis-
sel said. “Applications will go out 
through the roof even more than 

they’ve been.”

Harper said students are most 

interested in the creative suite, 
which features a sewing machine 
for students to use

“With all of the new technol-

ogy in this place I hear that stu-
dents are flocking to the sewing 
machine,” Harper said. “People 
who say that millennial’s don’t 
care about old fashions skills 
need to go check out the sewing 
machine.”

The designers also focused on 

improving multicultural, inclu-
sive spaces for students. The Cul-
tural Connector — a space lined 
with multicultural art that opens 
to East Madison Street and serves 
as the gateway to South Quad 
across the street — provides a 
space for students of all walks of 
life and backgrounds to connect 
with one another.

The previous Asubuhi Mul-

ticultural Lounge was not ideal 
for students to associate with 
one another when Diversity Peer 
Educator Jake Davidson, an LSA 
senior, was a freshman in West 
Quad. He said he is excited to 
make use of the new space.

“Prior to the renovation, the 

space was tucked into this corner 
of the concourse and had a rather 
intrusive column in the middle 
— needless to say that wasn’t 
too conducive for discussions,” 
Davidson said. “Since the reno-
vation lounge has been moved to 
the center of the concourse in this 
new design that’s open space but 
it reflects its history of providing 
a safe space for students.”

responsible and measured pro-
cess,” he said.

Kagan Ozer, orthopaedic sur-

geon and the program’s surgical 
director, stressed that the skill of 
the doctors involved is only one of 
the important variables dictating 
the success of the surgery.

Finding patients with the right 

mindsets is also crucial.

“They have to be well-disci-

plined, persistent people who 
must be happy to carry someone 
else’s hand or face for the rest 
of their lives,” Ozer said. “That 
requires a certain level of com-
mitment and ability to cope with 
that stress. The very first hand 
transplant performed in France 
resulted in the patient electing 
to get the hand removed nine 
months later. The patient couldn’t 
get over the feeling that the hand 
wasn’t his.”

While Ozer said the surgery 

team is ready to perform the pro-
cedure, the physical, functional 
and psychiatric screening proce-
dures mean that the first surgery 
could be months away.

The VCA donation process is 

also different than the process 
for organ transplantations. Those 
who join the Michigan Donor 
Organ Registry are not consid-
ered to have given consent for 
their hands or faces to be used in a 
transplantation.

“The Michigan donor registry 

does not cover VCA or the hand 
transplant,” said Tim Makinen, 
spokesman for Gift of Life Michi-
gan, the organization responsible 
for organ and tissue recovery in 
Michigan. “That is a separate 
authorization that Gift of Life 
would get from the family.”

The first hand transplantation 

took place in 1999, and fewer than 
100 of the surgeries have been 
completed since.

Theatre & Dance and Engineer-
ing. Phase two, which includes 
the Ross School of Business, the 
Law School, the School of Den-
tistry and the Rackham Graduate 
School, rolled out this August.

Sevig said the first phase 

proved the embedded model 
helps CAPS reach more students.

“We learned a lot from phase 

one and we made some tweaks, 
but in short it really worked, it 
helps,” Sevig said. “We have that 
by way of data, we have that by 
way of anecdotal stories, we have 
that by way of the number of stu-
dents that we’ve seen.”

The annual report also said 

the four schools and colleges who 
participated in phase one of the 
embedded model experienced a 
34-percent increase of students 
seeking initial consultations.

He added the new model is help-

ing reach students who otherwise 
would not have visited CAPS.

“Based on the data and the 

numbers, we think we have met 
a need in two different ways,” 
Sevig said. “We have seen stu-
dents who probably would have 
come to Central (Campus), that’s 
good because it makes it easier 
for students. The other beauty, 
based on the data, is we know 
that we are reaching students 
who wouldn’t have come and 
received help.”

The three phase-one staff 

members dedicated 1,452 clini-
cal hours and 189 hours of com-
munity service over the course of 
the 2014-2015 academic year.

Students are still welcome at 

the CAPS Central Campus loca-
tion, Sevig added.

“If a student feels uncomfort-

able with seeing the person in 
that school or college, maybe 
they’re uncomfortable because 
someone will see them go to 
that staff member’s office let’s 
say, the beauty of that model and 
approach is that they can come to 
Central,” he said.

Sevig said the schools selected 

to participate in phase two of the 
model were chosen for a variety 
of reasons, one of which was 
because they are all professional 
schools whose students operate 
on unique schedules.

“After going through a num-

ber of possibilities we settled 
on for the most part the idea of 
professional schools,” he said. 
“We did do some thinking about 
what are the particulars, not just 
being a professional school, but 
what are the particulars that go 
into that. Who are we under-
serving?”

Sevig said the Business school 

fit the mold for phase two not 
only because it is a professional 
school, but also because CAPS 
sees a lower percentage of stu-

dents from that school than from 
other schools and colleges.

“Ross was an example of where 

the percentage of students com-
ing to CAPS was lower than the 
University percentage,” he said. 
“It’s a little hard to know what 
goes into that, because you could 
call that we’re under-serving the 
Business School, but it gets con-
flated with gender. When we look 
at help seeking behavior in mental 
health care, it’s very standard that 
two-thirds are women and one-
third are men. ”

Business senior Jeffrey Yu, Ross 

Student Body President, wrote in 
an e-mail interview that he sup-
ports the embedded model.

“I think that embedding a 

CAPS counselor at the business 
school is a great idea,” he wrote. 
“Although Ross has an under-
graduate program, a large stu-
dent population here consists of 
MBA and masters students who 
will rarely leave the business 
campus. Putting a CAPS coun-
selor in Ross will make it more 
convenient for these students to 
access help if they need it.”

Echoing 
Yu’s 
sentiments, 

Business junior Libby Guise said 
the school should work on publi-
cizing the new resource.

“I think the CAPS program is 

a great start to addressing mental 
health,” she wrote in an e-mail. 
“I think the only thing the school 
could do would be to raise aware-
ness of the CAPS program. A lot 
of students aren’t aware of the 
resources the school offers, so 
doing a better job of conveying 
these opportunities to students 
would go a long way in terms of 
overall mental health on campus.”

Business junior Anna Nor-

man wrote in an e-mail that 
recent curriculum changes have 
made the business school more 
demanding for juniors.

“Junior year is different now 

that Ross has changed the cur-
riculum,” she wrote. “This year, 
most juniors have an all-Ross 
semester and are planning to 
study abroad for the winter 
term. This means that everyone 
is recruiting for summer intern-
ships (which is extremely time 
consuming to the point that it 
seems like another class) along 
with having very full semesters.”

Business junior Sarah Perry 

said the Business School’s cul-
ture can lend itself to higher 
stress levels.

“I think the competitive cul-

ture in Ross can be mentally tax-
ing,” Perry said. “The majority of 
people I’ve met in the Ross com-
munity are nice, hard-working 
and intelligent people who want 
to see their peers succeed. Both 
the process of getting an intern-
ship through Ross and the grade 
determination encourage a cut-
throat atmosphere, where stu-
dents may be tempted to cheat or 
lie to peers in order to save their 

own chances. A shift in the over-
all culture to a more collabora-
tive, supportive atmosphere may 
increase overall mental health.”

However, 
Perry 
acknowl-

edged this competitive culture 
also seems to encourage certain 
students to be more productive.

“I know many of my peers 

in Ross thrive in a competitive 
atmosphere, and the high stakes 
atmosphere has certainly kept 
me on my toes, so maybe it isn’t 
so bad after all,” she said.

Yu rejected the idea that the 

Business school is more competi-
tive than other schools and col-
leges at the University.

“I wouldn’t say that our cul-

ture is more competitive than 
other schools such as LSA and 
Engineering,” he wrote. “Every-
one here at Michigan strives to 
do well and Ross students are no 
exception. From group projects 
to interview prep sessions, Ross 
students are always helping each 
other out and pushing each other 
to do their best work.”

While a third phase for the 

embedded model is not currently 
in the works, it is up for consider-
ation, Sevig said.

“There is not an active phase 

three,” he said. “At the same 
time, we are looking at other 
possible ways given that based 
on last year, the model is really 
working. So we are thinking of 
other ways that this could help 
the campus. I think we’re going 
to take this year and really delve 
into that.”

 

LSA student builds, 
lives in tiny house 

After reviewing his yearly 

expenses for room and board 
and deciding they were too 
costly, Christopher Cerk, an LSA 
junior, decided it was time to take 
matters into his own hands. 

More than two summers ago, 

Cerk built a 170-square-foot 
house that he lives in during the 
school year. Dubbed the “Humble 
Trundle,” Cerk officially moved 
into the home last week. 

Cerk told USA Today that he 

considered living in a mobile 
home 
to 
cut 
down 
living 

expenses, but eventually decided 
building a home was best. 

“Living in a motor home 

would’ve taken the creativity out 
of the process,” he said. “I like 
knowing I built this myself.” 

Business school sees 
increases in women 
faculty members

The number of women faculty 

members at the Ross School 
of Business has increased by 
25 percent since 2011, recent 
data in the Chronicle of Higher 
Education shows. 

Ross School of Business Dean 

Alison 
Davis-Blake 
told 
the 

chronicle shortly after she was 
hired as Dean in 2011, professors 
raised concerns about the gender 
make-up of the faculty. 

“This wasn’t so much about 

replacing them,” said Davis-
Blake. “They felt the faculty 
is 
stronger 
when 
it 
isn’t 

homogenous.”

In turn, Davis implemented 

modifcations to the school’s 
hiring 
process. 
One 
change 

called for search committees to 
broaden their final candidate 
pool. Another gave committees 
the option to hire more than one 
professor in a single job search. 

UM researchers 
awarded grant for 
Detroit River study 

University researchers earned 

a $3 million grant from the Erb 
Family Foundation that will fund 
research into how the Detroit 
River 
contributes 
to 
algae 

blooms that emerge in Lake Erie 
each summer.

According to the University, 

the money will also go toward 
measuring the effectiveness of 
“green infrastructure” projects 
in Detroit. The specific projects 
in question are supposed to help 
control stormwater overflows. 
The overflows are thought to 
carry phosphorous that produc-
es much of the algae into both 
the Detroit River and Lake Erie. 

The toxin-filled algae blooms 

have been a continual problem 
for Lake Erie and the people 
living in its proximity, having 
caused a water supply shutoff 
to 400,000 Toledo citizens in 
August 2014.

The Detroit River supplies 80 

percent of the water and between 
40 to 50 percent of the phospho-
rous content to Lake Erie. 

Cell phones can help 
fight disease in Latin 
American countries

For the past eight years, Uni-

versity Prof. John Piette has 
studied “telehealth” and the 
positive effects it can have on 
people suffering from chronic 
diseases in several Latin Amer-
ican countries.

Piette has developed pro-

grams to help patients manage 
their diseases by sharing their 
health information on their 
phones. 

The chronic diseases cur-

rently targeted by the program 
include diabetes, high blood 
pressure and depression. 

The programs are designed 

for patients to have more access 
to care by receiving health calls 
on their phones when they are 
in-between 
doctors 
appoint-

ments. 

The study is to be published 

in Telemedicine and e-Health 
journal this month.

skilled trades down the road. 
He cited former Florida Gov. Jeb 
Bush’s support for Common Core 
as having the potential to open a 
conversation about education.

Wednesday’s debate did solicit 

responses on criminal justice 
and marijuana use — subjects 
Kall said may particularly inter-
est students. He noted that 
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is par-
ticularly popular among young 
people, largely due to his liber-
tarian leanings.

Though Michigan’s presiden-

tial primaries are still several 
months away, Kall said Ohio Gov. 
John Kasich is likely one of the 
more popular candidates among 
Michigan voters.

Kasich is generally known as 

one of the more moderate candi-
dates and is often seen as some-
one who would employ a similar 
approach to governance as Mich-
igan Gov. Rick Snyder. During his 
time in office, Snyder has mostly 
steered clear of policymaking 
around social issues, focusing 
more intently on areas like job 
training and economic policy.

Kall said Wisconsin Gov. 

Scott Walker might not have the 
same pull, given his geographic 
distance from the majority of 
Michigan voters and his more 
conservative leanings.

“Kasich will have a much 

more ripe opportunity based on 
geography and the way he’s built 
his strategy,” he said.

With such a large Republican 

field, Kall said Michigan could 
play a bigger role in the nominat-
ing process than in previous cycles.

“The longer it drags on, then 

the more important states that 
are later in the process become,” 
he said.

Public Policy senior Cody Gid-

dings, chair of the University’s 
chapter of the College Repub-
licans, said Florida Sen. Marco 
Rubio is the most popular can-
didate among University Col-
lege Republicans, according to 
a straw poll conducted by the 
group earlier this week.

“From my personal perspec-

tive, the large field is an advantage 
because it allows our organization 
to include an extremely diverse 
set of political beliefs from around 
campus. This political diversity 
allows us all to foster intellec-
tual and constructive debate sur-
rounding very important policy 
issues that our nation faces in the 
coming years.

Giddings said the group’s straw 

poll also showed foreign policy is 
a central area of interest among 
the University’s College Repub-
licans, and Wednesday’s debate 
covered that topic extensively.

“Initially, I felt the topics of 

the discussion surrounding Don-
ald Trump were unbecoming of a 
debate to nominate a presidential 
candidate,” he said. “Fortunately 
the debate shifted to a more pro-
fessional policy setting in which, 
in my mind, foreign policy played 
a large role.”

As for who won the debate, 

Giddings said he thinks it 
was Carly Fiorina, the former 
Hewlett-Packard CEO.

“Carly 
Fiorina 
without 
a 

doubt won that debate,” he said. 
“Fiorina’s 
incredible 
display 

of technical policy knowledge 
was something I was extremely 
happy to see as a young Repub-
lican who has felt that debate 
surrounding actual policy is 

something that has been serious-
ly lacking in the race for 2016 so 
far. I would give Marco Rubio the 
second place slot, he demonstrat-
ed his foreign affairs knowledge 
very articulately and with a con-
viction that many like myself had 
been waiting to see from him.”

Giddings said he has yet to see 

the appeal of Trump, however.

“Donald Trump has impact-

ed discussion in every single 
political organization across the 
nation and our organization is no 
exception,” he said.

While millions of people 

around the country tuned in to 
CNN on Wednesday evening, the 
University’s chapter of the Col-
lege Democrats held their weekly 
meeting instead.

“We didn’t watch the debates 

at College Democrats,” said Pub-
lic Policy senior Max Lerner, 
the group’s chair. “We had our 
executive board meeting and we 
weren’t going to let the Republi-
can debate slow down our prog-
ress to get the word out about 
what Democrats are doing to try 
and improve this country and try 
and improve Michigan.”

Still, Lerner said he was able 

to watch the beginning of the 
debate and felt the focus on 
Republican candidate Donald 
Trump has been overblown, 
whereas issues pertaining to 
income equality and higher edu-
cation were not mentioned.

“Republicans don’t want to 

talk about higher ed because 
just look at what they’ve done in 
Michigan, huge cuts to higher ed 
under Republican governors and 
a Republican legislature,” Lerner 
said. “That’s not just in Michigan, 
but that’s all across the country. 
Democrats are going to keep on 
fighting for students.”

I

f you are anything like me, 
you have grown emotionally 
attached to your planner and 

have anxiety at 
the thought of 
losing it. 

At the begin-

ning 
of 
each 

semester, I devel-
op the urge to 
buy sticky notes, 
colored 
pens, 

a 
whiteboard, 

whiteboard 
markers, 
wood 

pencils, 
colored 

pencils, mechan-
ical pencils, those fancy pencils with 
the roll-up erasers, and so many fold-
ers, notebooks and binders that it 
looks like I bought the entire “back to 
school” aisle at Staples. Needless to 
say, the beginning of any school year 
is a scary time, but before you decide 
to drop all of your classes and join the 
circus — come on, we’ve all thought 
about it — just hear me out. 

Each year, along with all of my 

new school supplies, I seem to 
develop a renewed sense of ambi-
tion. Classes aren’t hard yet, and 
even though I can tell some of them 
(shout out Chem 351) are going to 
be more than a handful, I somehow 
have a “bring it on!” attitude. Each 
semester, I feel ready to take on the 
world, but like clockwork, after the 
first set of midterms rolls around, I 
find myself halfway through a pint 
of Ben & Jerry’s, asking, “What did 
I get myself into?”

Last semester, I decided to address 

this problem head-on. If I had so 
much motivation at the beginning of 
the semester, how could I maintain 
that mindset throughout the year? 
In Public Health 300 last winter (a 
class that I highly recommend), Dr. 
Vic Strecher talked about goal set-
ting theory. The theory points out 
that specific goals, in combination 

with feedback, lead to higher perfor-
mances than does having no goals or 
vague goals. 

Though goal-setting may sound 

cliché, I realized that goals have 
a tendency to manifest in every 
aspect of my life, whether I make 
the conscious effort or not. Begin-
ning in freshman health class in 
high school, we talked about setting 
goals at the most basic level. Before 
that, I was setting goals in gymnas-
tics and working on them not just 
physically, but also visually. Today, 
on the wall at my gym, there are 
dozens of names under which peo-
ple write, rewrite and eventually 
check off their personal goals. For 
me, goal setting has always been 
an important part of my athletic 
life, but I have realized that it can 
be extended outside to all realms of 
personal health; maintaining aca-
demic sanity, for one. 

Enter: colored sharpies. 
Since putting all of this together, 

which seems more like common 
sense after writing it down, I have 
taken advantage of my extensive col-
lection of ink, chalk and whiteboard 
markers, and written down the dif-
ferent goals I have right now. The 
process of writing these goals was 
much more difficult than I expected, 
which is why I want to break down a 
few specifics:

1. Know your values: Before 

being able to write any sort of goal, 
it’s important to zero in on your per-
sonal values, and make sure that any 
goal you write is in support of and 
enhances those values. 

2. Start in the future: Think 

about where you want to end up in 10 
years first. There will only be a few 
goals, but that’s a good thing; no one 
should have their entire life planned 
during their junior year in college. 
After you have your 10-year goals, 
move back to five years, then one 
year and then six months. You’ll start 

to see what you can do now to actu-
ally attain those goals that seem so 
far away. Short-term goals are a great 
way to reach those in the long-term. 

3. SMART (or something like 

that): The concept of SMART goals 
(Specific, Measureable, Attainable, 
Realistic and Time-bound) has been 
hammered into my mind since my 
high-school health class. I would 
add to this only the letter “C” for 
challenging (sorry if that screws up 
the acronym). In Strecher’s class 
last semester, we learned individu-
als committed to a goal would per-
form better when the goal difficulty 
is high. Still, it’s important to know 
yourself and set goals accordingly 
(see “R” above). 

4. Write ‘em where you can see 

‘em: This is a point that I cannot 
stress enough. Writing goals down 
and putting them somewhere you 
can see them reminds you every day 
what you’re working toward. Those 
ridiculously colorful words on my 
wall could mean the difference 
between success and ending up back 
with Ben & Jerry. 

5. Don’t be afraid of change: Life 

is stressful, complicated and unpre-
dictable. Roll with it! Staples sells 
erasers too! Goals are important only 
so long as you take a step back every 
once in a while to assess your prog-
ress, acknowledge what is going well 
or poorly and make modifications. 

Right now I’m thinking about how 

difficult this year is going to be. For 
me it’s one of those times when I ask 
myself how I’m going to do it all. The 
classes, research, volunteering and 
clubs … it can definitely get to be a bit 
much. I set my goals to remind me 
what I’m working toward, one day at 
a time. 

How well will it go? I’ll keep you 

posted.

An exercise in critical thinking

I

t’s already the second week of 
school, so there’s a good chance 
that some big questions and 

hard facts have already been raised 
and put on the 
table for discus-
sion in courses, 
such as interna-
tional 
tensions, 

systemic societal 
prejudices 
and 

why we bother 
to 
differentiate 

between stalac-
tites and stalag-
mites. 
Facing 

these problems, 
discussing them 
rationally with evidence and logic, 
and taking the next steps once you 
have a more complete understanding 
of these complex issues takes prac-
tice and an open mind. Even those 
with an experience in conflict reso-
lution and diplomacy can struggle 
with this process, so I would like 
to walk us through an example as a 
start-of-the-school-year refresher.

To start us off, here is an alarming 

statistic that I just made up: Nearly 
90 percent of the pockets on pants 
marketed toward women have suf-
fered from malnourishment to the 
point of near-extinction. They’re one 
of the fastest-climbing groups on the 
endangered list, right after the black 
rhino and the use of cursive. Out of 
all my pairs of jeans, there isn’t a 
single pair that I can fit my entire 
hand into, and I have average-sized 
hands; I’m sure individuals with 
well-endowed hands suffer even 
worse. Some of my pants even have 
fake pockets.

In light of these serious facts, let 

me propose a conspiracy theory: the 
systematic extinction of pockets on 
pants marketed towards women is 
actually a ploy by Big Fashion to sell 
more purses.

It makes sense, doesn’t it? (This 

is 
where 
the 
openmindedness 

comes in.)

Less holding space needs to be 

made up for somehow, and if pur-
chasing more is our only option, 
we’re going to do it. My needs are 
no different than those who wear 
pants from the men’s section; I need 
to have my phone, keys, various 
candies, various candles, umbrel-
la, assortment of woodworking 
tools and wallet on my person at 
all times, which is impossible with 
the coin-purse sized pockets on my 
jeans. Instead, we are expected to 
invest in extra accessories to make 
up for the value-sized features pro-
vided to us.

In this discourse like any other 

socratic seminar, others may bring 
up counterpoints or new facets to 
the issue, and listening is key. For 
instance, some may say that this 
problem is actually indicative of 
what has been called the “Woman 
Tax” or the “Pink Tax,” which 
alludes to the price gouging that the 
products marketed towards women 
go through; a razor put in the men’s 
section might be much cheaper than 
the same one in pink in the women’s 
section. Some might say that the only 
reason we as a society put up with 
this so-called tax is to adhere to lim-
iting gender norms. Another point 
to bring up in this discussion is that 
the small pockets might actually be 
to encourage a slimmer fit to pants, 
which plays into the objectification 
and sexualization that women’s bod-
ies are subjected to in our culture.

However, I said my idea first and 

loudest, so all of these people that 
may say these other things are either 
wrong or don’t matter, and I win.

Thus, step one is complete: estab-

lishing the facts and some back-
ground for further context to this 
ongoing 
injustice. 
Now, 
what’s 

important to remember about the 
issues that we discuss in classes and 
face as a society is that debate and 
understanding is only one step. Pro-

posing well-thought-out solutions 
and eventually implementing them 
is truly the end goal.

In this case, I have a variety of 

solutions, all set to go. For instance, 
we can all just stop wearing pants. If 
we boycott the companies that force 
small pockets upon us and perhaps 
mix in a letter-writing campaign, 
then they’ll have to give into our 
demands. Similarly, we could per-
haps all buy pants from whatever 
section we want, gendered or not, 
but giving them our business regard-
less of their pocket size decisions 
would only encourage more tom-
foolery. Another idea would be to 
get rid of phones, keys, wallets, etc., 
and move our society towards more 
of a commune model in which there 
is no currency or individual housing. 
We wouldn’t need pockets nearly as 
much then, but the drawback here is 
that it might take more than a week, 
and we don’t have that kind of time 
to spare. Instead, I propose what is 
easily the best option of the bunch, 
which is to take down Big Fashion 
with an agent on the inside. They 
would never see it coming.

At this point, one or many of these 

solutions would be championed by 
the masses, brought to the attention 
of the media and the world at large, 
and it would be fixed within days, 
thus ending this cycle of critical 
thinking and discourse. I’m certain 
that this exercise has been helpful 
and made the process a simple one to 
follow, and now it is well within our 
means to fix every problem the world 
is facing, now and in the future. 
You’re welcome.

In all seriousness though, pants 

manufacturers: please, I’m begging 
you, give me somewhere to put my 
phone and a place for me to stick my 
hands when I’m standing awkward-
ly. It’s really not that much to ask.

Not a date, temple

I

’m lucky because unlike the 19th century 
French-Jewish artillery officer Alfred 
Dreyfus and the AEPi Fraternity at Emory 

University, a Jewish frater-
nity that was vandalized 
with offensive graffiti in 
2014, I have never experi-
enced anti-Semitism. From a 
young age I’ve been taught that anti-Semitism 
is real and it could be lurking anywhere, but 
I never seemed to encounter this enigmatic 
monster. I was raised Jewish in New York City, 
where, according to The Wall Street Journal, 13 
percent of the country’s Jewish population cur-
rently resides.

Despite being a Midwestern public school, 

the University has a large Jewish popula-
tion as well. The school offers a wide range of 
Judaic studies classes and has a huge Hillel and 
Chabad religious system. According to Hillel.
org, the University of Michigan undergradu-
ate population is about 16 percent Jewish. This 
is an astoundingly high number, considering 
estimates show that less than 2 percent of the 
United States’ population is Jewish.

At the University, I’ve met a supportive 

group of people who come from of a variety 
of cultures. My group of friends is much more 
diverse religiously than they were at home. In 
New York, those who aren’t Jews know about 
Jewish culture. For the first time in my life, I’m 
surrounded by people who do not understand 
Judaism. I’ve never been in a place where peo-
ple don’t know that “Bubbe” means grandma, 
“schvitzing” means sweating and “batmitzvah” 
means I had an over-the-top party when I was 
13 because I sang a bunch of Hebrew words 
I didn’t understand in front of my 200 clos-
est friends and family members. These words 
either come from Hebrew or Yiddish, a Jewish 
language of German origin that comes from 
Eastern Europe and is passed down in tidbits 
by Bubbes.

It has hit me, in the past few weeks, that no 

one cares about Jewish holidays. No one seems 
to care about anyone else’s religion with the 
exception of the person who creates the Snap-
chat filters. Yet those are often used disrespect-
fully in contexts completely irrelevant to a 
given holiday. 

Everyone likes Christmas because it means 

happiness, cheer, Santa and, of course, pres-
ents. People like to talk about Hanukkah and 
Kwanza because they fall around the same time 
of year and they like potato pancakes. I’ve yet 

to meet someone who celebrates Kwanza, but 
I’m not giving up. We’ve all heard of Ramadan. 
When I was little, I couldn’t fathom not eating 
for a whole month. I had yet to learn about the 
whole sun-sets-and-then-you-eat situation. 

All of this aside, when I run into friends 

dressed up, on my way to services, they say, 
“You look so nice! Are you going on a date?” 

It doesn’t even occur to them that I may have 

a religious commitment. Happy New Year? 
Shana Tova? Everyone’s confused. When it’s 
Easter, we all know why some are wearing pas-
tels or headed to church in their “Sunday best.” 
It’s literally called your Sunday best. You go to 
church, on Sundays, wearing your best. 

The Jewish holy day actually falls on Satur-

day rather than Sunday. 

Since leaving New York, the reality has 

begun to hit me that I’m part of a minority pop-
ulation in our nation. Despite constantly feeling 
safe and comfortable in my own religious back-
ground, I now understand that I come from 
a group of people who went through a geno-
cide less than a century ago. For the first time 
ever, I feel a connection with those who were 
oppressed in Europe in the 20th century.

I feel frustrated. I feel frustrated that public 

schools often get three weeks off for Christmas, 
yet the holiest of Jewish holidays are complete-
ly brushed over. I miss my family and I miss my 
synagogue, but I can’t even take solace in time 
at Hillel or spent with Jewish friends because 
I’m too busy with other commitments. Club 
presidents, professors and GSIs seem to be com-
pletely blind to the holidays. The Apple Calen-
dar on my computer didn’t have Rosh Hashana 
or Yom Kippur automatically programmed in. I 
guess they don’t qualify as official U.S. holidays. 
I guess my religion isn’t important enough. I 
know this goes for so many other religions as 
well, and I know there are religions that are 
more obscure and brushed over than my own. 
I know I’m lucky that Jews are even acknowl-
edged at all. 

I’m of an overrepresented minority with 

many powerful and wealthy people who make 
up an extremely small portion of the popula-
tion. Yet, my religion being ignored and under-
valued somehow makes me feel as if I’m a less 
important part of society. Since I was a little 
kid I was told that Hanukah is not as good as

Am I like Iggy?

W

hen I wear a kurta pyjama to my 
half-brother’s wedding in Germa-
ny, why do I think I’m not stepping 

into Iggy-Azalea-cultural-
appropriation territory? 

As a white person, I may 

not be “TumblrCertified” to 
defend my choice to wear 
formal desi clothing. How-
ever, I can speak to how I 
took one familiar element in 
my life — dance — and used 
it to surround myself with 
amazing new friends, an 
inspiring community and 
valuable experiences. 

When I first meet some-

one with an, “I’m Liam! Nice to meet you,” I 
can generally tell when their eyes check me 
off as irrelevant. At first glance, I don’t stand 
out much; I’m just another tall white guy 
wearing fitted sweatpants, Nikes and some 
University organization crewneck. Not that I 
really amount to more than that, but there is a 
bit more to what I’ve found at this school than 
meets the eye. 

After eight years of competitive dancing in 

typical western styles (jazz, hip hop, contem-
porary, ballet), I got involved with my high 
school’s Indian American Student Associa-
tion, and did some basic bhangra and fusion 
performances. After discovering the commu-
nity that came along with Indian American 
dance, I came to Michigan excited to con-
tinue. With the University’s IASA, I had the 
wonderful opportunity of learning and per-
forming a Raas (traditional Gujarati dance) 
routine in 2014, and hope to learn and per-
form with IASA classical in 2015. 

The University’s fall IASA show is North 

America’s largest student-run production, 
and after sitting through last year’s two-hour 
long show of Indian dance performances, 
the first thing my dad says to me in his heavy 
Bavarian accent is, “You should join the Ger-
man Student Association instead!” 

Sorry, dad. Never before in my German-

American life had I been exposed to such a 
large community of students who 1) Have 
immigrant parents (a defining trait which I’ve 
found produces wonderfully insightful and 

resilient humans), 2) Love to dance and care 
about putting on a killer performance, and 
3) Are partially interested in me for the one 
thing I find boring about myself: being white. 

After one year of being a dancer and cho-

reographer, I’m now one of four captains of 
Michigan Izzat, the University’s all-male bolly-
wood-fusion dance team, which competes with 
a routine composed of bollywood, bhangra, 
hip-hop and contemporary. My freshman year, 
I got to compete with my new team in Austin, 
New York, Atlanta, Chicago and at the finals, 
Bollywood America, in Phoenix. 

I knew I was officially part of the colle-

giate Bollywood dance community once some 
members of other teams began referring to 
me as “King Liam,” a nickname my friends 
from high school now mock me for. I’m val-
ued not only for my dancing abilities, but for 
being a token white boy. After winning first 
place in Atlanta, an Indian guy from another 
team told me I “stole the show.” 

Am I taking advantage of my race in an 

insidious way, or just playing my cards right 
and invoking some bizarre minority-as-a-
majority privilege? Am I taking the bolly-
wood-fusion spotlight away from those who 
deserve it? 

I like to justify it by telling myself that it’s 

OK because it’s not like I’m running around at 
Coachella wearing a bindi, but is it?

Just a few months ago, my interest in India 

broke through the dance lens with which I 
had always understood it. This summer, I 
spent four weeks in Amritsar, India, studying 
“Sustainable Nourishment” through langar 
and seva (service) at the Harmandir Sahib. 
Informally referred to as the Golden Temple, 
the site of the holiest Sikh gurdwara has been 
serving more than 40,000 free and nutritious 
meals per day for the past 400 years. And yes, 
to my extreme pleasure, we did also take daily 
bhangra classes in Amritsar. 

On my last day of doing seva at the Har-

mandir Sahib, I bought myself a kara, the 
steel bracelet which is one of the five articles 
of Sikhism, and haven’t taken it off since. I 
had reservations about wearing one due to 
cultural appropriation and the fact that I’ve 
barely scratched the surface of Sikhism, but 
my professor was very supportive. Yet, I still 

stand by my original reservations. 

Do I have the right to dance and 

dress as the desis do, despite not 
having to endure the same racial, 
cultural and religious hardships? 
I like to tell myself that the dif-

ference between myself and Iggy 
is that I’m actually trying to edu-
cate myself and learn from Indian 
people, rather than taking fashion-
able elements and reappropriating 
them. I’m still not completely sure 

where that line is drawn, but I hope 
to remain aware of its presence as I 
dance along it.

FOOTBALL
Mattison finds stability 
with veteran defensive line

Experienced core 
now flourishing 
with consistency

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

In the four years he spent as 

the Michigan football team’s 
defensive 
coordinator, 
Greg 

Mattison preached experience. In 
that time, he knew he had young 
players getting playing time, and 
that they would be better for it in 
the long haul.

The long haul he imagined is 

now, when Mattison’s defensive 
line features six fourth-year 
players on the two-deep and 
appears poised to be a part of 
a game-changing defense this 
season.

But the path to get to this year 

wasn’t quite how Mattison drew 
it up. He came back to Michigan 
(after five years as a defensive 
coach in the 1990s) in 2011 to 
work for then-head coach Brady 
Hoke. 
Last 
offseason, 
when 

Hoke was fired, new coach Jim 
Harbaugh brought in D.J. Durkin 
from Florida to be the defensive 
coordinator.

Mattison, who coordinated a 

successful defense in 2014 despite 
the team’s struggles, accepted a 
position as defensive line coach 
to complete the progress he had 
started with his defensive-line 
recruits.

“It just shows that he cares 

about Michigan a lot,” said 
redshirt junior defensive tackle 
Matt Godin. “I know for a fact he 
wanted to finish out our group of 
guys, stay with us and coach us 
through. It means a lot.”

Wednesday, 
Mattison 

downplayed the impact he has 
had as the lone holdover from last 
year’s staff.

“I don’t know, I don’t ever 

think about that,” he said. “When 
a new staff comes in, they’re not 
new after about a week anyhow.”

Mattison 
did 
acknowledge, 

though, that he has enjoyed 

coaching the same group of 
players 
for 
four 
years. 
His 

presence, and the continuity it 
has established, are noticeable.

In Michigan’s home opener 

Saturday, Oregon State burned 
the Wolverines with a seven-play, 
79-yard touchdown drive on the 
opening possession. Two plays 
later, the defense headed back out 
after a fumble gave the Beavers 
the ball at Michigan’s 24-yard 
line.

But Mattison, who has coached 

plenty of games in Michigan 
Stadium with the same players, 
wasn’t concerned.

“There wasn’t any panic,” 

he said. “You 
knew it was 
a 
breakdown 

here and there 
that caused it. 
You knew that 
we were going 
to 
make 
the 

adjustments we 
had to on the 
sideline. 
D.J. 

does a great job with making sure 
he knows what’s going on in all 
parts of it. We just got everybody 
together and said, ‘This is what’s 
happened. This is what we can’t 
let happen.’ And they adjusted to 
it, and they did it.”

Mattison 
has 
also 
kept 

expectations constant for his 
defensive line from last year 
to this year. Working with the 
players in the past allowed him to 
know their tendencies, so while 
Harbaugh and his staff came in 
and reevaluated the team as it fit 
into their system, the Wolverines 
knew where they stood with 
Mattison.

That aspect of his presence, 

Mattison acknowledged, was an 
asset.

“Me being with these guys, 

they know what I think they can 
do and what they have to do,” 
Mattison said. “So there’s not 
that (time) where you say, ‘Well, I 
didn’t know he was that good,’ or 
‘He had this to work on.’ ”

That consistency has allowed 

the defensive line to get to work 

right away.

Redshirt 
junior 
defensive 

tackle 
Chris 
Wormley 
has 

become a breakout player, with 
six tackles for loss in two games. 
Redshirt junior Willie Henry has 
moved to the outside, where he 
has been a capable replacement 
for the departed Frank Clark 
and Brennen Beyer. Even lesser-
known names like Godin and 
junior 
defensive 
end 
Taco 

Charlton have stepped in and 
provided depth.

That 
depth 
supports 
the 

hallmark of Mattison’s defensive 
lines — rotating bodies in and 
out to stay fresh. This season, 

the Wolverines 
have played as 
many as eight 
linemen in their 
two 
games 

this 
season. 

The 
modern 

spread offense 
is designed to 
wear defenses 
down by going 

sideline to sideline and pushing 
the tempo. Mattison’s scheme is 
designed to prevent that.

The comfort level, expectations 

and depth have made the defensive 
line a capable component of the 
defense coordinated by Durkin, 
for whom Mattison had high 
praise as well. Mattison seems as 
optimistic about this defense as 
he has been with any of the ones 
he has had.

“I like the energy,” he said. “I 

like the intensity. I mean, I like the 
guys. You’ve been with them a long 
time, you like them and you want 
them to have success. It’s been fun. 
It’s fun seeing them develop.”

And for them, it has been fun 

developing under him. Three or 
four years ago, they committed 
to him, and in the offseason he 
committed to them in return.

“He recruited me. He recruited 

all these guys,” Godin said. “It 
brings us definitely closer because 
we’ve been with him. He came to 
our houses. He brought us in. He’s 
part of the reason we came here, 
a lot of us.”

“He came to 

our houses. He 
brought us in.”

Detroit upsets Michigan

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

For the Michigan men’s soccer 

team, it was the same story but a 
different season on Wednesday 
night 
against 
Detroit 
at 
U-M 

Soccer Stadium.

Once again, the Wolverines 

fell hard at the hands of a 
lesser opponent after proving 
themselves against a national 
powerhouse, 
tying 
No. 
4 

Maryland on Friday.

In the 12th minute of play, 

junior defender Rylee Woods 
turned the ball over to Detroit 
forward Tyler Moorman deep 
in Michigan’s defensive half, 
and it quickly became a costly 
mistake. Moorman played a 
quick combination with forward 
Spiro Pliakos before blasting the 
ball just inside the far post.

The finish would be the first 

of the Titans’ two goals, as 
Michigan fell, 2-1.

After the Wolverines (2-2-1) 

conceded a goal, they went on 
to dominate the half, but came 
away with nothing to show for it 
due to the Titans’ man-marking 
system.

“Detroit always plays man-

marking (defense),” said senior 
forward Colin McAtee. “They 
kind of just set a blockade back 
there when we’re in possession, 
because they know we’re a 
team that can out-possess them. 
Instead of high pressing, they just 
sit in there, and today they did it 
well.

“Their center backs were all 

over us, and we didn’t do enough 
to find a second goal to get the 
result.”

Eventually, 
in 
the 
61st 

minute, the Titans shocked the 
Wolverines once more. After 
a 
failed 
clearance, 
Detroit 

midfielder 
Alex 
Mendonca 

received the ball out wide and 
lofted a service to the back post.

Detroit defender Jason Leslie 

outjumped Stevens for the ball 
and hammered the ball just under 
the crossbar with his head, just 
out of reach of the outstretched 
arm of sophomore goalkeeper 
Evan Louro.

After going down two, Daley 

switched to a 3-3-4 formation to 
generate a stronger attack, and 
the change quickly paid off.

Just four minutes after the 

Titans’ 
second 
goal, 
senior 

forward William Mellors-Blair 
received a ball in the 18-yard box 
and was taken down for a penalty 
kick after beating his defender 
one-on-one. He stepped to the 
penalty spot and buried a shot 
into the bottom-left corner to cut 
Detroit’s lead to one.

Following the senior’s penalty 

finish, the Wolverines seemed 
to find new life, forcing Detroit 
into a defensive shell as they 
generated opportunities.

Michigan’s most threatening 

sequence came in the 73rd 

minute, when Woods’ corner kick 
bounced back to him. Woods sent 
a second ball into the box that 
junior defender Lars Eckenrode 
deflected on target, but Detroit 
goalkeeper Nathan Steinwascher 
punched the ball away from goal.

Throughout the Wolverines’ 

equalizing effort, Woods and 
sophomore 
defender 
Billy 

Stevens frequently attacked on 
the wing with overlapping runs, 
attempting to serve dangerous 
balls into the box for Michigan 
to 
finish. 
The 
Wolverines 

dominated possession and held 
the ball in Detroit’s defensive 
half, but could never penetrate 
the Titans’ (3-2-2) back line with 
a final pass to create legitimate 
scoring opportunities.

“We dominated the ball but we 

didn’t really dominate chances, 
although we had more shots,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 

Daley. “When the game is a 
little bit more even, it gives us 
an opportunity to have more of a 
free flowing (attack). When (they) 
sit in and don’t play as much, we 

have 10 guys behind the ball, and 
it certainly makes it a little bit 
challenging.”

Michigan continued to dictate 

play through the midfield and 
combined well in the attacking 
third, but Detroit’s park-the-bus 
strategy proved too solid to break 
down.

The Wolverines tallied seven 

shots and two corner kicks after 
Mellors-Blair’s goal, but couldn’t 
break 
through 
to 
score 
an 

equalizer.

Despite 
the 
upset, 
Daley 

looked for a silver lining.

“It’s a little bit of a struggle 

sometimes 
mentally,” 
Daley 

said. “We have a young group, 
so hopefully we can learn from 
it. It’s still early in the season, so 
hopefully we continue to grow. 
That was the message I gave the 
group.”

MEN’S SOCCER
Nason strong at 
midfield in loss

By SYED FAHD AHSAN

Daily Sports Writer

Six 
minutes 
into 
the 

second 
half 
of 
Michigan’s 

2-1 loss to Detroit, Titans 
defender 
Jason 
Leslie 
rose 

highest in the penalty box to 
head the ball past Michigan 
sophomore 
goalkeeper 
Evan 

Louro, doubling Detroit’s lead. 
Now 
down 
2-0, 
Michigan 

men’s 
soccer 
coach 
Chaka 

Daley subbed off sophomore 
midfielder 
Michael 
Kapitula 

and 
brought 
on 
freshman 

forward Marcello Borges in a 
bid to find goals. The already 
fast-paced match was about to 
become a hurricane.

In the middle of the chaos 

was junior midfielder Brett 
Nason, a player who struggled 
for playing time last season but 
has started every game this 
season.

“I think he’s been the most 

consistent player we’ve had all 
season,” Daley said. “In every 
game he’s done an outstanding 
job. He’s been solid and steady 
against every team, in every 
game and in every training 
session.”

Solid 
and 
steady 
would 

be an understatement when 
describing Nason’s performance 
Wednesday night. The holding 
midfielder was a reference point 
for all his teammates on the 
pitch, ever-present to receive a 
pass. He was reliable in keeping 
and redistributing possession 
— by all standards, the team’s 
chief playmaker.

“I 
just 
try 
to 
put 
my 

teammates in better positions,” 
Nason said. “It’s very easy when 
your teammates are making 
great runs off the ball.”

But Nason wasn’t just great 

at passing the ball. He was 
a defensive stalwart when it 
came to pressing the opponent, 
sticking in a foot and making 
the tackle and winning the 
ball back as quickly as possible. 
He was always where the 
Wolverines needed him to be, 
whether it was as an outlet 
when they needed to move the 
ball around, or in defense when 
they needed him to cover the 
Michigan fullbacks and break 
up the Titans’ play.

“The one thing going through 

my head was win the ball and 
get it forward,” Nason said. “We 
needed a goal. I was just working 
hard for my teammates, and I 
know they were doing the same 
for me.”

In a game where Michigan 

had subbed off its entire front 
line within 30 minutes of the 
starting whistle, and where 
players 
moved 
around 
the 

field to make room for extra 
forwards, Nason was the one 
player — barring Louro — who 
was neither subbed off nor 
moved into a different position.

With long balls flying over 

his head back and forth, players 
running around him left and 
right, Nason was arguably the 
most reliable player on the 
pitch. He barely made a wrong 
step. He was the eye of the 
hurricane, even in defeat.

Quarterback play a numbers game

Fisch wants 

starter Rudock to 
limit turnovers in 

coming weeks

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

For 
Michigan 
passing 

game coordinator Jedd Fisch, 
measuring quarterback success 
is partially a numbers game. 
And through two games for 
fifth-year senior quarterback 
Jake 
Rudock, 
the 
numbers 

aren’t pretty.

Rudock has been responsible 

for 
five 
turnovers 
as 
the 

Wolverines’ starter. He threw 
three 
interceptions 
in 
the 

season opener at Utah, and 

fumbled early in Michigan’s 
victory against Oregon State 
before throwing an interception 
late in the game.

During his career at Iowa, 

before 
he 
transferred 
to 

Michigan over the summer, 
Rudock wasn’t known as a 
turnover-prone quarterback. In 
fact, he was one of the best in the 
Big Ten at limiting giveaways. He 
threw just five interceptions last 
season as the Hawkeyes’ starter.

Despite the rough start, Fisch 

believes Rudock can return 
toward his career mean. Fisch 
provided a math lesson to the 
media Wednesday to explain his 
point.

“So he’s thrown four, which 

is two right now (per) game,” 
Fisch said. “If we can have a 
few games with zero, he can get 
right back to his average. If you 

throw one a game, you throw 12 
for the year. If you can get a few 
games with zero, you can get 
that number down to about six 
or seven. So he’s got to do that. 
Strive for that number, to get 
to somewhere less than 10 for 
the year, and try to double the 
touchdowns. (I’d) like to get to a 
2:1 ratio there or more.”

One ratio of Rudock’s that 

Fisch is pleased with is the 
number of sacks he has taken. 
In 76 dropbacks this season, 
Rudock 
has 
been 
sacked 

only 
once, 
a 
statistic 
that 

Fisch believes is reflective of 
Michigan’s entire offense.

Somewhat surprisingly, the 

turnover 
that 
disappointed 

Fisch most was not one of his 
interceptions, but the lone sack 
that caused a Rudock fumble 
in the first quarter against the 

Beavers.

“That 
was 
most 
the 

avoidable,” Fisch said. “He had 
an opportunity to kick it out 
there when he was hot, and held 
onto the ball.”

The 
coach, 
even 
while 

acknowledging 
room 
for 

improvement, is not short on 
confidence when it comes to 
his quarterback. He pointed to 
Rudock’s completion percentage 
against Oregon State (69.2) as 
a sign of success, saying that 
completing 70 percent of passes 
is a goal he has in mind for his 
quarterbacks.

Despite Rudock’s reputation 

as little more than a game 
manager, Fisch is pleased with 
the way the Wolverines have 
attempted to spread the field 
early in the season.

Fisch is also learning on the 

job. This season has provided a 
new experience for the coach, 
who has worked as an offensive 
coordinator both in college 
football and the NFL. Fisch 
said this has been the first 
staff he has worked with that 
makes play calls as a group. Of 
course, Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh has the final say, but 
most decisions are the result of 
a collaborative effort, unlike on 
most teams where one coach 
calls all of the plays.

The experience has been a 

positive one for Fisch, so much 
so that it’s something he would 
advocate for on any coaching 
staff he works on in the future.

“It’s something that I would 

always do from now on,” Fisch

One of the most well-documented and contro-

versial aspects of the United States is its complicated 
relationship with food. Through years of unsustain-
able agricultural practices, the U.S. faces shortages of 
fresh food, particularly in impoverished communities. 
 

Combined with the prevalence of obesity, diet-related 
illness and reliance on government food assistance, 
the dearth of healthy, fresh food in these areas paints a 
bleak picture.
 
Emilie Engelhard, the communications direc-

tor for the sustainable food startup Fair Food Network, 
sees the food dilemma more positively, as does the en-
tire organization.
 
“Where others see problems, we see opportuni-

ties,” Engelhard said. “The work at hand is really about 
pioneering inspiring but practical solutions that don’t 
solve problems, but that look at the food system as a 
whole and … work on multiple parts of it simultane-
ously.”
 
Founded on the belief that everyone deserves 

access to healthy, fresh, sustainably grown food, Fair 
Food Network attempts to help underserved communi-
ties gain access to healthy food, help farmers earn more 
money and strengthen local economies. 

 
“Part of what the work of this organization is 

building a more just and equitable 
food system that 

supports families in getting the most delicious and nu-
tritious food possible while also insuring that farmers 
are earning a fair amount for their food,” Engelhard 
said.
 
To Engelhard, the work is incredibly fulfilling, 

both due to the broad scope of food’s influence in our 
lives and the competence of the organization. 
 
“Food is something that connects all of us and 

it’s something that, when you’re working on the issue, 
you have the ability to talk about so many things, such 
as the foundation for a healthy society, stories about 
family and the ability to create a more fair system that 
supports everyone, both in terms of the health of our 
families, the health of our communities, local and re-
gional economies, and our environment,” Engelhard 
said. “Food really fits some of the biggest challenges we 
face as a nation, and some of the biggest opportunities. 
It’s an honor to be a part of an organization that works 
in such a dynamic way to create a more just and equi-
table food system, and it’s also helping produce really 
powerful results for families and farmers.”
 
To achieve this goal, Fair Food Network tailors 

its efforts so that they can support the economy, farm-
ers and consumers at the same time. 
 
“We really think of this as the ‘win-win-win’ 

solution in terms of supporting farmers, economic de-
velopment and also, most of all, the local population,” 
Engelhard said. “That’s where we really see the need 
right now: being able to practice multi-win solutions 
that help move the field forward faster, and that don’t 
just tackle one problem at a time.”
 
The company has achieved great success in 

this goal through several specific programs. Their Fair 
Food Funds program provides financial and business 
assistance to innovative sustainable food companies. 
Additionally, the company is part of the Michigan Good 
Food Fund, a loan and grant fund created to stimulate 
economic demand for locally grown food.
 
The most well known of these programs is 

called Double Up Food Bucks, a healthy food incentive 
program which attempts to create economic incentives 
for producing and consuming locally grown food. Es-
tablished in 2009 in a farmers market in Detroit, Dou-
ble Up Food Bucks gives low income U.S. citizens an 
opportunity to purchase fresh produce at a discounted 
price.

“How it works is that if you’re 

a family, or you’re someone who’s 
received 
Supplemental 
Nutri-

tional Assistance Program ben-
efits, and you go to a participating 
site, and you spend $20 of your 
Nutrition Benefits at that site, you 
get a dollar-dollar match up to 
$20 a day to buy Michigan-grown 
fruits and vegetables,” Engelhard 
explained. “You can bring home 
$40 worth of healthy food for just 
$20.”

Fair Food Network puts an 

emphasis on producing and pub-
licizing tangible results with its 
programs, and the results of Dou-
ble Up Food Bucks have proven to 
be a success. Since 2009, families 
participating in Double Up Food 
Bucks have purchased 4 mil-
lion 
pounds 

of 
healthy 

food using the 
program 
and 

SNAP benefits. 
According 
to 

surveys 
con-

ducted by Fair 
Food Network, 
participants of 
the 
program 

have 
greater 

access to fruits 
and vegetables 
and, as a result, 
can 
decrease 

the amount of 
junk food they 
consume.

Farmers 

have also ben-
efited from the 
program, with 
the year 2009 
seeing a $7 mil-
lion 
increase 

in SNAP and 
Double Up sales for farmers. 63 
percent of farmers report mak-
ing more money, and 50 percent 
report gaining a new customer 
base. Additionally, farmers are 
able to buy new equipment and 
plant a wider variety of crops 
with the money they have 
earned.

Since its formation in 2009, 

the program has expanded to 
more than 150 sites across the 
state of Michigan, and Fair Food 
Network intends to expand this 
program even more. 

“We’re now helping partners 

in communities across the coun-
try to bring this proven model 
to their community,” Engelhard 
said. “There will be 239 Double 
Up markets in 13 states includ-
ing Michigan. We’ve done a lot 
of work, translated the program 
into a toolkit and are now ready 
to provide technical assistance to 
partners to help them get up and 
running and leverage all the les-
sons learned.” 

The success of this program is 

the paragon of one of Fair Food 
Network’s primary goals: to cre-
ate programs that can create a 
tangible impact in one area of the 

country and replicate the program 
for use in other places. While their 
programs always begin at the local 
level, the company’s aspirations 
are to spread nationally.

As communications director for 

Fair Food Network, Engelhard is 
tasked with presenting the orga-
nization’s goals and utility to the 
public in an accessible way. 

“The power of communication 

is really about storytelling,” Engel-
hard said. “What is the story of the 
work we do as an organization? 
Why is it important in the world 
today? And what are the results 
and evidence of the work that 
we’re doing? How I see my role, in 
a couple parts, is helping articulate 
that story and then communicate 
that story to both internal and 
external audiences. The other part 
of it is creating a lot of tools to sup-
port the organization in telling the 
story as well.” 

Some 
tools 
at 
Engelhard’s 

disposal include social media 
channels and presentations. But 
perhaps the most powerful tool 
Engelhard uses to display Fair 
Food Network’s usefulness is the 
bounty of statistics that speak to 
the positive impact of the compa-
ny’s programs such as Double Up 
Food Bucks.

By keeping detailed tabs on the 

economic impact of the Double 
Up Food Bucks program, Fair 
Food Network has gained lever-
age to influence public policy and 
has used that leverage to great 
effect. The success of Double Up 
Food Bucks led to a provision in 
the 2014 Farm Bill to supply the 
Food Insecurity Nutrition Incen-
tive program with $100 million, 
which will be used to fund similar 
programs — a massive financial 
gain for pioneers of sustainable 
food.

Additionally, Fair Food Net-

work received a $5.1 million grant 
from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture to expand Double Up 
Food Bucks’ operations. Over the 
next three years, the grant will 
be matched with private funds, 
which will amount to more than 

$10.4 million, which will be used 
to spread the program’s reach 
even further throughout Michigan 
farmer’s markets.

Cooperating with the govern-

ment is one of the many ways that 
Fair Food Network uses collabo-
ration as a means of reaching its 
goals. 

“The success of this program is 

completely grounded in partner-
ship,” Engelhard said. “Only by 
working together have we had the 
success that we have had. From 
local markets to meeting public, 
private and nonprofit organiza-
tions across the state, we really 
rely on the support of a diverse 
network of partners.”

Integral to the success of the 

Double Up Food Bucks program is 
Fair Food Network’s cooperation 
with SNAP-Ed agencies, organi-
zations that provide information 
about the Supplemental Nutrition 

Assistance 
Program. 
These 
agencies 
integrate 
informa-
tion 
about 

Double Up 
Food Bucks 
into 
their 

social media 
campaigns, 
bringing 
more expo-
sure to the 
program 
and to Fair 
Food 
Net-

work as a 
whole.

Another 

important 
collaborator 
is the Michi-
gan 
Farm-

ers Market 
Association. 

Through extensive communica-
tion with this organization, Fair 
Food Network received clear-
ance to implement their programs 
in farmers markets throughout 
the state of Michigan, and the 
two organizations have jointly 
increased the prevalence of gov-
ernment food assistance in the 
state of Michigan. In 2007, less 
than $16,000 in SNAP dollars were 
used at Michigan farmers markets, 
whereas in 2014, just under $1.6 
million in SNAP dollars were used. 
Today, Michigan ranks third in the 
nation and first in the Midwest for 
the use of SNAP dollars in farm-
ers markets, even though less than 
four percent of all SNAP users live 
in the state of Michigan. This dis-
proportionate amount of Michigan 
SNAP users has Fair Food Net-
work and its collaborators to thank 
for helping them attain access to 
fresh, sustainably grown food.

Fair Food Network does not 

claim to have invented the concept 
of the Healthy Food Incentive pro-
gram, but does take credit for pio-
neering the idea of spreading such 
programs to the national level. 

“What makes our program 

unique is that Double Up Food 
Bucks is the first statewide 
healthy food incentive program 
to employ that reformed design 
and centralize administration in 
a local implementation,” Engel-
hard said. “Fair Food Network 
has developed the program — 
we administered the program 
at a statewide level. You can also 
earn Double Up Food Bucks in 
Detroit and use them at anoth-
er participating site. Fair Food 
Network pioneered the first 
uniformly designed, robust pro-
gram and demonstrated that 
we can really work at that scale 
in a huge geography supporting 
rural, urban and suburban com-
munities alike.”

Even considering everything 

the organization has done and the 
sheer scope of its operations, the 
Fair Food Network can’t take on 
this problem alone. To make sure 
the goal of a sustainable food sys-
tem is met, ordinary people also 
have to do their part. 

“Research shows that when 

most of us think about food, we 
tend to think about what’s going 
to be for dinner at night,” Engel-
hard said. “We think about the 
food in our fridge. Some of us 
think about where we’re going 
to be shopping. What’s really 
needed right now is for us to 
be thinking more dynamically 
about food as a system. The 
opportunity ahead of us is to 
envision food as a system and 
not just our individual experi-
ences with food.”

“We cannot eat our way out of 

the challenges we face as a nation,” 
she continued with gravity. Hope-
fully, with the help of organiza-
tions such as Fair Food Network, 
we won’t have to.

In Stats 250, homework assign-

ments always ended with the same 
yes or no question: Do you consider 
yourself sleep deprived?

We were never told the reason 

behind the survey, so I’m assum-
ing it was a longitudinal study 
on whether our sleep patterns 
changed throughout the course 
(see, look how much I learned!) but 
it needs closer inspection. Without 
fail, my cursor would drift toward 
the “Yes” box, because I’m a college 
kid. Saying “I’m so tired” has mani-
fested into a nervous tick, some-
thing to groan when the Blue Bus 
comes around the corner: “How 
are you?” “I’m so tired.”

Mutual fatigue is something we 

all share — at least, everyone tells 
us we’re sleep deprived and we 
dazedly agree. It’s widely accepted 
that the average college student’s 
schedule looks something like 
this: Wake up around 11:00 a.m., 
make a minimal effort to prepare 
for 11:30 class, buy a cheap meal 
around 2:00, hit the gym on a good 
day, then hunker down for a study 
session that will last until the wee 
hours of morning. Or, if it’s a week-
end, replace the stacks with Skeeps.

In every scenario, the com-

mon denominator is clear: Late 
nights and absent mornings. In 
order to balance sleep depriva-
tion, our tried and 
true solution is 

to maximize the nighttime hours 
(where the “magic” happens) and 
sleep in as long as possible. This 
“magic” comes in different forms 
— it’s cracking that sweet solution 
in orgo after a midnight espresso 
shot, or sprinting down Hill Street 
in four 
-inch heels because the bars 

are closed and why not? — and is 
always more monumental in the 
moment than the next day, when 
we wake up with pounding head-
aches and a ticking reminder that 
half the day is spent.

But wait — unconventional or 

not, if we students still get seven 
hours of sleep a night, sometimes 
more, why are we sleep deprived? 
What can we do to not always feel 
so tired?

The answer is fundamentally 

obvious: We aren’t nocturnal. 
Our bodies are programmed to 
rise with the sun and rest when 
it sets, so that our memories can 
consolidate, our muscles rebuild 
and our bones elongate. When the 
body’s internal clock is tweaked 
by habitual late nights and sleep-
ing in, these processes stutter and 
slow, resulting in an unkickable 
feeling of fatigue. This tiredness 
then sets off a host of other bad 
habits, like disorganization, poor 
diet and exercise slack. Accord-
ing to Women’s Health, night owls 
consume about 248 more calories 
a day, double the junk food and 
half the amount of fruits and veg-
etables of an early riser — they’re 
also more sedentary, possibly due 
to a smaller time-frame to hit the 
gym. Forbes reports that people 
who hit the sack earlier and rise 
early are more in sync with Earth’s 
circadian rhythms, which provides 
more restorative sleep — and less 
pounding headaches.

But the benefits of going to 

bed early and waking up earlier 
stretch beyond simply feeling less 
tired and making smarter choices 
about diet and exercise. Though 
we stubbornly associate early 
mornings with grogginess, stud-
ies have shown that the opposite is 
true — early birds tend to be more 
focused and self aware. In the 
Forbes article, studies found that 
“morning people” came out ahead 
in the workplace by using their 
early hours for setting goals and 
organizing the day; they were also 
more likely to anticipate challenges 
and tackle problems efficiently. 
Since memory is consolidated dur-
ing sleep (meaning information 
we’ve absorbed throughout the day 
“sticks” so it can be later recalled), 
restorative sleep is the key ingre-
dient to speedier mental function. 
Like muscles need protein to grow 
stronger, brains need sleep to be 
sharper.

Ok. So say you close your lap-

top at 11:00 and set your alarm for 
8:00, getting a full eight hours of 
Earth-dictated, circadian rhythm 
-

-synched sleep. But when you wake 
up with the chirping birds, you’re 
still — drumroll — exhausted. 
What then?

Roll out of bed and work out. 

Yes, it may be the last thing you 
want to do — as we tend to think 
early mornings cause grogginess, 
we also assume that exercising at 
dawn only exacerbates exhaustion 
— but you won’t regret it. Here’s 
why: Physical activity spikes ener-
gy levels and revs up metabolism, 
waking up your body much more 
effectively than a shot of espresso, 
or even an extra hour of sleep. 
While this energy boost can hap-
pen at any time of the day, morn-
ing exercise induces better sleep at 
night, whereas a sunset run is likely 
to leave you tossing in your sheets.

Chances are, you’ve already 

heard this: Early bird catches the 
worm. Early to bed, early to rise, 
makes a man happy, healthy and 
wise. Like most habits, it’s hard to 
nip late nights and lazy mornings in 
the bud, no matter how many stud-
ies tell us we’ll be happier if we run 
six miles at 7 a.m. and then spend 
an hour organizing our weekly 
schedule. The trick to becoming a 
morning person — or adapting any 
healthy habit, really — is to make 
compromises.

For me, that compromise is a 

steaming cup of coffee. Every time 
I stumble out of bed to run at 6 
a.m., I make a beeline for my cof-
fee maker. While the coffee brews, 
I change into running clothes, lace 
up my shoes and pad back to the 
kitchen just in time for its sputter-
ing stop. For 10 perfect minutes, 
I’ll sip my coffee and feel my body 
slowly twitch awake. This little 
routine is just enough motivation 
to keep me running out the door.

And let’s face it. Drooping eye-

lids, pounding headaches and 
bloating from the Pizza House 
cheesy bread you had delivered to 
the UgLi last night aren’t pretty. 
Make it a goal to become a morning 
person by finding your own com-
promise, whether it’s an immediate 
cup of coffee or a stop at Bruegger’s 
on the way to your eight a.m. class. 
Then check “No” for the sleep 
deprivation survey — your body 
and mind will thank you for it.

TRAILER REVIEW

 “Black Mass” will mark the first 
time in probably a decade since 
Johnny Depp did not play “John-
ny Depp.” 
You know the 
ones — those 
sad renditions 
and varia-
tions on Jack 
Sparrow. It’s 
an endearing 
kind of char-
acter, but the joke really expired 
in 2005. We’ve all come to expect 
the same old song and dance from 
the three-time Academy Award 
nominee.
 Well, Depp reinvents himself 
here as Whitey Bolger, the savage 
Irish-American crime boss from 
Boston who created the Winter 
Hill Gang. Bolger is famous for 
serving as an FBI informant 
for several years until fleeing 
supervision in the mid-1990s. 

He remained at large for 16 years 
until the age of 81 when he was 
apprehended in Santa Monica.
 “Black Mass” focuses on the 
period in the late 1970s and early 
‘80s when Bolger rose to crimi-
nal prominence. A star-studded 
cast of supporting talent, which 
includes Joel Edgerton, Benedict 
Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson 
and Kevin Bacon, gives the film a 
strong sense of character — obvi-

ously with Bolger at the helm.
 The most unnerving aspect of 
Depp’s character seems to be the 
way in which he compels people 
to betray their secrets, beliefs and 
alliances. He narrows his blue 
eyes, gets tense about the shoul-
ders, inverts the natural smirk 
on his face and he digs. He digs 
straight to the things guarded and 
buried deep.

SINGLE REVIEW

 It’s been nearly three years 
since P!NK dropped her last stu-
dio album, The Truth About Love. 
And aside 
from her col-
lab album 
with City and 
Colour, she 
has been rela-
tively quiet 
until … until 
now. She’s 
back and so is 
her singular sound.
 This year marks Ellen Dege-
neres’s 14th season on air, and 
seeing that her and the pop star 
are close friends, it only makes 
sense that she would pen the 
show’s new theme, “Today’s the 
Day.” However, this song is much 
more than a catchy intro to an 
afternoon talk show. It’s loud. It’s 

fun. It’s inspiring, much like its 
singer/songwriter.
 In typical P!NK fashion, the 
chorus soars up and away from 
the rhythmically spoken verses 
which pack a tongue-in-cheek 
punch of their own. Despite age 
and motherhood pulling the 
pop star away from her tough 
demeanor, lyrics “This kool-aid 
ain’t for me” and “I get so vicious 
when I don’t feel delicious” 
remind fans that the fire and 

eye-rolling still radiate from the 
“Blow Me” songstress.
 Beyond the obvious self 
empowerment, the beats, deliv-
ery and bridge embody what a 
great pop song is. If you’ve been 
alone and bored in your bed-
room, or are just looking for a 
song to score your fall semester, 
look no further. Today is P!NK’s 
day; Today is my day; Today is 
your day.

Inspiring ideas at 
826 ‘robot shop’

A2 non-profit 
fosters creative 
writings skills 

By BAILEY KADIAN

Daily Arts Writer

“What the heck is this thing?”
One weekend, in the spring 

of 2013, Tom Bianchi passed by 
the Liberty Street Robot Sup-
ply & Repair shop on his way to 
get some coffee after work. After 
multiple occasions of passing the 
robot shop and questioning its 
purpose, Tom investigated to find 
a bit more information. Years 
later, Bianchi is the program 
assistant for the nonprofit.

Bianchi’s reaction of intrigue 

is exactly what 826michigan 
hopes to evoke.

The Liberty Street Robot Sup-

ply & Repair shop is home to 
826michigan, a nonprofit orga-
nization that is committed to 
developing creative writing skills 
through writing workshops and 
tutoring sessions for students ages 
six to 18.

The traffic of people com-

ing into the shop out of curios-
ity is how most volunteers and 
students get involved with the 
organization.

“It is something that is sublimi-

nally in your mind all the time. 
A robot shop? That is a weird 
thing,” Bianchi said. “If you walk 
by enough times, it actually draws 
you in.”

The shop isn’t designed to 

bring 
people 
seeking 
robot 

expertise 
to 
Liberty 
Street. 

It’s intended for the child who 
is enamored by the robot, and 
comes in to see more.

Initially, when you walk into the 

shop, shelves full of robot-themed 
supplies, books and apparel greet 
you. Further in, you find the home 
of 826michigan, with tutoring 
areas, writing labs and shelves of 
children’s books, most of which 
are published works of the stu-
dents who have worked with the 
organization. 

826michigan is a branch of a 

national organization started in 
2002 by writer and editor Dave 
Eggers and educator Nínive Clem-
ents Calegari. 826 has chapters in 
areas all over the country, serving 
students and teachers in numerous 
learning communities.

826michigan provides services 

such as writing workshops, field 
trips, drop-in tutoring, publish-
ing and outreach projects that 
are meant to fuel creativity, at no 
cost to students. The programs 
for these projects are designed 
to be fun and productive, as 826 
emphasizes the importance of 
one-on-one attention and assis-

tance for each student who works 
in the writing lab. Over 3,000 stu-
dents in the southeastern Michi-
gan area work annually with the 
organization.

The focus of expressing imagi-

nation through writing encourag-
es children to develop their ideas 
into a story. The satisfaction of 
seeing their work published keeps 
them coming back.

Schools in the Ann Arbor area 

travel to the shop on field trips, 
where often an entire scenario is 
created through words, with lay-
ers of theatrics, to encourage stu-
dents to get excited about a new 
writing experience. Volunteers 
and staff get to witness the pro-
cess of students coming into a new 
environment, mixing ideas with 
excitement and eventually creat-
ing a story dictated entirely by 
their thoughts and imagination.

After years of reading numerous 

stories written by children visiting 
the shop, Bianchi’s favorite works 
come from the wildest ideas.

“With students that age, any-

thing can happen,” Bianchi said. 
“We’re in the middle of a chase 
and the protagonist has to stop for 
coffee. If the characters want to, 
they stop for coffee.”

During a staged interrogation 

in a crime-mystery themed field 
trip, one student’s theory was as 
follows:

“We should ask every one of 

these potential suspects if they 
like cake. Because if they don’t like 
cake, then obviously they are a bad 
person, and they did it.”

As Bianchi puts it, the kids’ 

ideas are “the perfect logic of it.” 
It’s out there. It’s unpredictable. 
It’s crazy. But it’s acceptable.

During a release party at the 

Boggs School in Detroit — a part-
ner school of the organization 
— students presented their new 
publication “Where Is It Coming 
From?” Communications coordi-
nator of 826michigan Courtney 
Randolph described the experi-
ence as memorable and rewarding, 

both for students and teachers.

“I loved seeing their pride when 

Dave Eggers himself declared his 
love of the students’ pieces,” Ran-
dolph said. “He stepped away from 
the microphone to allow them to 
read their writing while he lis-
tened as part of the audience.”

The transformation from stu-

dents’ initial reactions to working 
with the organization, to the result 
of seeing their pride toward their 
published work is gratifying.

“It moved me especially because 

some of the writers published in 
that book were terrified to write 
on the first day of our workshop,” 
Randolph said. “To see those same 
students beaming with broad 
smiles as they autographed books 
for Dave Eggers was very special.”

The focus on personal recog-

nition helps students feel indi-
vidually 
encouraged 
toward 

their writing. 826 believes that 
their staff’s individual dedication 
to a story and excitement toward 
it will lay the foundation to con-
tinued development of writing 
skills for students of all ages. The 
one-on-one discussions between 
staff and students reminds stu-
dents that their ideas are taken 
seriously and their work is valu-
able, which produces confidence 
toward their future development 
as writers.

826michigan has locations in 

Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, as well as 
a new location in Detroit. The non-
profit also travels to other schools 
in these areas to work with teach-
ers and students in the comfort of 
their classrooms.

“This has unequivocally been 

one of the best work experiences 
of my life,” Randolph said. “I 
deeply believe in our mission to 
teach and inspire a love of writing 
in students.”

If you find yourself on East Lib-

erty Street, passing the shop and 
asking yourself, “What the heck 
is this thing?” your curiosity will 
lead to a lot more than just robot 
repair supplies. 

McDonald returns 
to Hill Auditorium

By REBECCA GODWIN

Daily Arts Writer 

It would be an understate-

ment to say that singer and 
actress Audra McDonald (“Pri-
vate Practice”) 
is 
successful. 

Successful 
doesn’t 
begin 

to encapsulate 
all 
that 
she 

has achieved. 
With six Tony 
Awards, 
two 

Grammy 
Awards, 
and 

three 
Emmy 
nominations, 

McDonald is an entertainment 
powerhouse. And this Thurs-
day, she returns to Hill Audito-
rium for her sixth concert at the 
University.

McDonald was born in Ber-

lin, Germany but grew up in 
the U.S., eventually receiving 
vocal training at Juilliard. Her 
first role on Broadway came 
in 1992, while still in school, 
when she was cast as a replace-
ment in “The Secret Garden.” 
She won her first three Tony 
awards between 1994 and 1998 
and was the first person to 
ever win three of the awards 
while still under the age of 30. 
In June 2014, she claimed her 
sixth Tony Award for her per-
formance in the musical play 
“Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar & 
Grill,” making her the record-
holder for most Tony Awards 
ever won by single person.

So why keep coming to Ann 

Arbor? McDonald said it’s the 
talent within the university 
that draws her back every time.

“The school is wonderful and 

I think the musical theatre pro-
gram has some magic pixie dust 
in their water or something 
because they keep churning out 
star after star after star,” said 

McDonald, who is currently 
doing a concert tour around the 
country. “So I’m very impressed 
by the energy there and the tal-
ent there so that’s why I keep 
coming back.”

McDonald was last in Ann 

Arbor in 2013 where she per-
formed in honor of George and 
Ira Gershwin’s musical genius. 
During that concert she per-
formed a number of classic Ger-
shwin pieces as well as an array 
of other songs, including a few 
original pieces written espe-
cially for the singer. Audiences 
can expect a similar selection 
this time around.

“It’ll be a plethora. The audi-

ence is pretty used to me intro-
ducing them to new songs from 
new composers that are making 
their way and then songs they 
know really well,” said McDon-
ald. “I try to change it up quite 
a bit but there will certainly be 
composers that they are famil-
iar with: Sondheim, there might 
even be some Gershwin, and 
there will definitely be some 
Roger and Hammerstein. Just a 
big variety.”

This concert tour is just 

one of the projects McDonald 
is currently working on. Her 
movie, “Ricki and the Flash,” 
starring 
Meryl 
Streep 
just 

came out in August and she 
just finished filming the new 
live action of Disney’s “Beauty 
and the Beast,” where she’ll be 
playing Garderobe, the ward-
robe. She’ll even be making a 
return to Broadway next year 
in George Wolfe’s new musical 
“Shuffle Along.” With so many 
projects going at the same time, 
it would only be natural for 
McDonald to grow tired of the 
work, but work is her life, so she 
says, and she couldn’t see her-
self doing anything else.

“What I am is what I do. It’s 

who I am. I don’t know any-
thing else. It’s the only thing 
I know how to do,” she said. 
“I have deep admiration and 
respect for producers, directors 
and writers but I know that’s 
not my forte. I’m doing what I 
love and what I want to do.”

Performing isn’t the only 

passion in her life though. 
McDonald is an avid supporter 
of a number of charities, includ-
ing Covenant House, which 
assists homeless youth, as well 
as PFLAG, which offers support 
for the LBGTQ community.

“These are issues having to 

do with equality and making 
sure there is social justice for 
everybody, and taking care of 
each other as citizens of the 
world,” said McDonald. “It is 
our job to take care of each 
other. You’ve got to give back.”

And yet, giving back isn’t just 

limited to donations. McDonald 
understands that students may 
be strapped for cash, but as she 
explained, giving one’s time 
and energy is just as important 
as any financial contribution.

“There’s always someplace to 

volunteer. Just volunteer your 
time even if it’s just at a local 
homeless shelter or the chil-
dren’s hospital, or something. 
Just volunteer your time,” said 
McDonald. “Giving up your 
time is just as important, just as 
valuable.”

For those students who may 

wish to follow in her impressive 
footsteps, she had this piece of 
advice: “Don’t turn down any 
opportunity to perform, wheth-
er it be at your local YMCA or 
church or community theater, 
the experience of being on stage 
is the same. No matter where 
it happens, live performance 
is the same dynamic, so get as 
much experience as you can, 
wherever you can.”

‘True Cost’ reveals 
price of fast fashion

By CARLY COLONNESE

For The Daily

“The True Cost” is a docu-

mentary about fast fashion — a $3 
trillion industry — and explores 
how the inexpensive clothing we 
buy at an alarmingly rapid pace 
directly influences how the items 
are made. Having such a low 
selling price means that produc-
tion costs have to be even lower. 
This cheap and wildly successful 
business model has resulted in 
terrible work conditions, major 
environmental 
polluting 
and 

associated health affects that 
factory workers must endure due 
to these sordid environments. 
Directed by Andrew Morgan 
(“After the End”), it aims to edu-
cate viewers about the negative 
outcomes the fast fashion indus-
try has on the planet, factory 
workers and consumers.

It’s alarming that even in light 

of these facts, the billion-dollar 
companies in question have done 
nothing to improve the working 
conditions, raise factory workers’ 
pay or make any effort to reduce 
the pollution their factories 

produce. “The True Cost” tells 
audiences about the 2013 Dhaka, 
Bangladesh factory collapse that 
killed more than a thousand 
workers. 
This 
tragedy 
was 

eminently avoidable if proper 
care would have been practiced 
to fix the cracked foundation 
of the building. Workers came 
to supervisors expressing their 
anxieties about the unstable 
building and some even went as 
far as to ask for the building to be 
fixed so they could work in a safe 
environment. However, rather 
than forgoing a day of work to 
secure and repair the building, 
managers 
inherently 
forced 

workers to stay, giving them 
an ultimatum — if they did not 
attend work, they would be fired. 
Later that same day, the building 
completely collapsed.

Morgan interviews numerous 

garment factory workers from 
Bangladesh, a hub for Western 
fashion brands to produce their 
goods. The interviews illustrate 
both the working culture of these 
factories and how truly minis-
cule each worker’s pay is, often 
as low as $ a day. Garment fac-

tory workers are predominantly 
women and their workdays can 
sometimes exceed 16 hours. In 
countries where work is hard 
to find for (largely uneducated) 
women, factory work is often 
the only option. Surrounded by 
chemicals and hot conditions, 
these factories are near-toxic 
environments for the worker and 
the land surrounding them.

“The True Cost” brings to 

light major facets of the fast fash-
ion industry to showcase that the 
cheap clothing items are danger-
ous beyond the affordable price 
tag. How did business come to 
value cheap clothing more than 
human life and the environment? 
Fast fashion.

The rise of fast fashion — think 

stores like Forever 21, H&M, 
Zara, Uniqlo and Topshop — is 
redefining what fashion is and 
means. These stores produce new 
clothing at such an alarmingly 
fast rate that the clothing you 
purchased from these fast fash-
ion giants last week can already 
be out of style. Like anyone else 
who has shopped at these stores, 
the ease and appeal stems from 

purchasing many items for the 
cost of one brand name item.

Marketing 
campaigns 
pro-

moting fast fashion businesses 
have influenced consumers that 
quantity is more important than 
quality. I will admit, even I’ve 
completely fallen victim to fast 
fashion, as has most of the world, 
who collectively purchase more 
than 80 billion pieces of clothing.

“The True Cost” prompts 

viewers: Is this ideation of quan-
tity over quality still appeal-
ing when natural resources and 
human lives are at stake?

My answer after watching: 

It’s complicated.

This 
documentary 
seeks 

to educate viewers about the 
backend of the fashion industry 

and why we all need to learn 
the importance of valuing the 
clothing you own. To value 
one’s clothes does not neces-
sarily mean to stop shopping at 
these fast fashion stores. Rather 
it means to buy items there that 
you know you will wear a lot and 
appreciate them. Instead of own-
ing six similar pieces, own a cou-
ple and take care of those items 
— whether that means spending 
more money on a higher qual-
ity piece rather than three inex-
pensive items that are obviously 
made cheaply the decision is on 
you. We as shoppers can choose 
quality over quantity, or we can 
choose to promote dangerously 
unethical 
practices 
through 

clothing that will not withstand 

time and wear.

Style is not about the brands 

you own or the amount of clothes 
in a closet, it is about conscious-
ly making sustainable choices 
by investing in pieces that are 
adaptable to different styles and 
will be worn over and over.

As consumers we need to 

completely reprogram how we 
think about and how we under-
stand shopping. The too good to 
be true, low-priced items found 
at these fast fashion giants may 
have instant appeal, but tak-
ing into consideration the short 
lifespan of the clothing and the 
negative 
impacts 
associated 

with the manufacturing, the 
price you pay is much higher 
than the sticker.

‘U’ alum Logan 

Light talks 

confidence and 
growing crowds

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

“It’s become second nature to 

the point of not getting nervous 
anymore. I walk out in front of 
20,000 people in Chicago, and 
it’s the same thing I was doing in 
my bedroom four years ago.”

University alum Logan Light 

balances the weekend triumphs 
of his EDM band, Mako, with 
a more traditional workday — 
finishing his last year of law 
school at New York University 
and working as a summer 
associate.

The 
confidence 
that 

sometimes evades him in his law 
school classes comes naturally in 
times of high demand for dance 
music, such as the summer of 
2015. Light, along with partner 
Alex Seaver, performed at highly 
anticipated festivals such as New 
York’s Electric Zoo, Michigan’s 
Electric Forest and Chicago’s 
Lollapalooza. Of course, as with 
any performances, there will be 
ups and downs.

“Lollapalooza was quite an 

interesting experience,” Light 
said. 
“About 
three 
minutes 

in, someone comes yelling at 
us, ‘You gotta shut it down 
immediately, we’re evacuating 
the whole thing.’ ”

There was a storm coming 

in and the management was 
concerned about heavy winds 
potentially blowing down stages.

“It was a pretty big crowd for 

us and we were like, ‘You have 
gotta be kidding me.’ They put 
us in a car back to the hotel,” 
Light said. “Once we got back, 
they called us and said the storm 
missed the park, so as soon as we 
could get back (to Lollapalooza) 
we could go back on. We literally 
jumped back in the van.”

It’s times like these where the 

lightness and agility of DJing 
equipment outweighs that of a 
band. Mako was able to quickly 
plug in while bands had to sound 
check gear again.

“We literally plugged back in 

and played and the crowd ended 
up being 50 times bigger. They 
told us we had 25,000 people so 
it ended up working in our favor 
in a very bizarre, weird way,” 
Light said. “It went from being 
completely devastating to being 
one of the best shows we ever 
played, so it was pretty cool.”

Before his current life of shows 

at festivals and clubs around the 
country, 
Light’s 
experiments 

with EDM were closer to home. 
He 
attended 
the 
University, 

majored in communications and 
graduated in 2011.

“I guess I always grew up 

around (EDM). I have an older 
brother who was five years older 
than me who always kind of 
listened to it, and it was pretty 
common for me growing up.” 
Light said. “I ended up going my 
freshman year to Columbia in 
New York and I absolutely hated 
it. Michigan was the only school 

that would accept me for the 
winter semester, and that’s why 
I ended up going to Michigan. 
It was the best thing that ever 
happened to me.”

He moved to Ann Arbor in 

the fall of his freshman year, 
not attending classes until the 
winter.

“I convinced my parents to 

let me DJ and said, ‘Please can I 
borrow some money, I promise 
I’ll make some money doing 
this,’ and they said, ‘Yeah right.’ 
But they thankfully gave me 
some,” Light said. “I bought two 
turn tables and a buddy showed 
me how to do it. At that time it 
wasn’t common, it wasn’t easy, 
it wasn’t very cool like it is now, 
and I just taught myself how 
to do it in my brother’s living 
room.”

EDM did not gain very much 

widespread 
popularity 
until 

about 2010, in Light’s junior year 
of college.

“Until it changed, people 

would always request rap music. 
I just always remember people 
asking for T.I.’s ‘Whatever You 
Like.’ Just as the requests started 
to change in 2010, I realized 
(EDM) was picking up traction 
and it could be something real 
musical genre-wise.”

Light began to contribute to 

the EDM scene in Ann Arbor, 
focusing specifically on working 
with 
downtown 
nightclub, 

Necto.

“I ended up getting a call 

from the people at Necto, and 
in an effort to say ‘I want to 
play shows,’ I helped them book 
shows,” Light said. “My senior 
year to the year after I graduated, 
we brought in a bunch of artists 
like Avicii and Zedd and Above 
& Beyond. I think it was six of 
the now top ten DJs in the world, 
which was cool.”

After graduation, Light met 

his future partner, Seaver, in 
Los Angeles. They come from 
different musical backgrounds, 
as Light had performed mostly 
electronic 
music 
for 
clubs 

and parties, and Seaver had 
just graduated from Julliard 
with a scholarship for a studio 
orchestra. But together, they 
were able to create a blend of both 
the expertise of classical infused 
with the sensation of EDM. 
When Light speaks of Seaver, it is 
impossible to miss the affection 
and respect in his voice.

“Thankfully, Alex has the 

brain of a musical genius.” Light 

said. “He hates when I say this, 
but he probably is the most 
talented musical person I’ve 
ever met. And none of what we 
do would be possible without 
him. I mean he’s the brain of it 
all, and I’m lucky to be along for 
the ride. Musical composition is 
his world, and every once in a 
while I add my two cents and he 
says, ‘Oh that’s smart,’ but that’s 
his cup of tea, not mine.”

Despite his modesty, it is 

clear without Light’s knowledge 
of EDM and charisma Mako 
would have never made it to 
the level that it is now. His 
passion for his art, even when 
it was considered “uncool,” has 
always been a priority for him. 
When discussing future plans 
for himself and Mako, the same 
touch of humble pride in his 
work shines through.

“We’re 
planning 
to 
put 

an album out in January or 
February, and hopefully we can 
tour if people enjoy it. It will be 
more of a live band ordeal, so 
we can try and transition into 
that and get out of the DJ stigma 
and the DJ world,” Light said. 
“Because the way we write the 
music is more like a pop or a rock 
band … we want to give people 
a different show, something 
that’s a little more enjoyable and 
unique.”

The 
excitement 
for 
this 

anticipated album is tangible 
when 
speaking 
to 
Light. 

However, the technology that 
has helped them succeed in an 
industry is also what prevents 
them from profiting financially. 
Light is part of a generation 
that believes in the freedom of 
everything, from information 
to music. In this vein, Mako has 
almost 13 hours of free mixes 
on iTunes in podcasts and their 
songs can be found in every 
corner of the Internet.

“You’re looking at it from a 

purely monetary point of view, 
but there’s an emotional part. 
Since we like to share what we 
like to do, hopefully people are 
interested and want to come to 
the show,” Light said. “In this 
day and age, it kind of sucks to 
say, but music is free and for all 
the time and effort we put into 
one song there probably won’t 
be a financial return, but we’ll 
see it hopefully in shows. I don’t 
mind that the music is on there 
for free as long as people enjoy 
it and it gets to them. That’s all 
that really matters.”

Daily Cultural Cures Columnist

Dear Cultural Cures –
There’s this girl. Not a girl or 

some girl. This girl. I’ve known 
her forever, which is measured by 
the infinite number of hours I’ve 
thought of her since tripping over 
her speakers when we moved in 
freshman year. You know this girl. 
She’s at every party, every bar; she 
works the scene wherever she is 
with her restless (yet maddeningly 
easygoing) energy.

I’m in love with her. So is the guy 

she sits with in Vic Lit. And the one 
who lives in her apartment. And the 
dude who bought her a cocktail with 
egg whites, or some shit, at The Last 
Word last night. And the one she’ll 
meet at the Blind Pig tomorrow. My 
best friend too. A friend of yours as 
well, I bet.

Occasionally she enters into 

a sort of relationship with one 
of these guys, exquisite in its 
ambiguity, 
breathtaking 
in 
its 

commitmentlessness. It’s way south 
of “exclusive,” but just far enough 
north of the one-nighter to keep 
each poor bro thinking he can win 
her over, and that he can be jealous 
when she gets with the next one.

We’re close, and often end up 

stumbling down South U. in search 
of late-night quesadillas together 
after the party dies down. Oh, she 
knows I love her. She says she loves 
me too and comes over at any hour 
whenever she needs to vent or talk 
— but when it comes to realizing a 
romance, you know, she “just can’t.” 
I nod and pretend I understand, 
somewhat happy that at least 
I’m not just another one of her 
whatevers.

I’m playing it cool, but — not 

gonna lie — it’s torture. 

– South of South U.
* * *

Dear South,
Your femme impossible, like 

most goodies under the sun, is 
nothing new. From Aphrodite 
and her many lovers — some 
from afar, some from much closer 
up — to the “modern woman” 
of the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries, you can’t blame a girl 
for doing what she wants. That’s 
not to say she doesn’t have real 
feelings, including for you. I’m 
sure her affection is genuine, just 
multi-directional.

You’re right to pity the fools 

who drool over this young lady, 
and those who read months-
or-more 
into 
her 
days-or-

less. They’re not worthy of 
Shakespeare’s 
“green 
eyed 

monster” of jealousy.

This girl, despite confessions 

of feelings for you, is a wild thing, 
no more capturable than the 
wind. “If you let yourself love 
a wild thing,” Truman Capote 
explained 
in 
“Breakfast 
at 

Tiffany’s,” “you’ll end up looking 
at the sky.”

For 
how 
to 
proceed, 
I 

recommend you look at Ernest 
Hemingway’s “The Sun Also 
Rises.” Lady Brett Ashley is deep 
into the Parisian café scene. She 
is irresistible, with her boyish 

haircut and exuberant effect. 
She dabbles in dalliances with 
pretty much every character in 
the book. Each wannabe suitor is 
a case study in how not to react to 
such a woman. Mike Campbell, 
Brett’s supposed fiancé, loses it 
one night drinking in Pamplona 
and has a throwdown with 
Robert Cohn, with whom Brett 
had gone to San Sebastian for 
some Basque sexy time. Mike’s 
drunken outburst is awkward for 
the entire group and reveals an 
awfully ugly side of him to Brett.

South, I know you dismiss 

the 
other 
chaps 
revolving 

around your chica as somewhere 
between pitiable and pathetic, 
but did you mention your best 
friend among them? I’m guessing 
you respect him some? Try to 
be open with him and not bottle 
up your feelings; because after 
you down a few bottles, you will 
only break the cringe-meter and 
maybe some other stuff too.

Even worse is Robert Cohn’s 

game, which begins with a clingy, 
stalkerish 
sort 
of 
approach 

and ends with pre-meditated 
physical harm to his perceived 
competitors. Not a good look, 
leaving him with nothing but 
memories of pinxtos in San 
Sebastian.

Then there’s the 19-year-old 

toreador stud Pedro Romero. 
Romero’s tactic is to try to 
change Brett, get her to grow 
her hair longer and become more 
womanish, and presumably a 
more traditional, monogamous 
lady. Although Romero sees she’s 
not going to do that for him and 
ends up accepting her, Brett 
nonetheless decides she “just 
can’t.”

These faulty characters covered, 

we are left with Jake Barnes. 
I’d say in your own scenario, 
Señor South, you’re playing Jake. 
Although I assume you don’t have 
a war injury that holds you back 
from consummating a relationship 
with your Lady Ashley, you, like 
Jake, are not one of her flings, 
but are her constant, her steady 
Platonic love. Jake bends at Brett’s 
will and runs at her beck and call. 
This isn’t healthy for him — or for 
you — and will only lead to a life of 
therapy and counseling.

The best thing you can do is 

take some time away from her. You 
don’t need to make it a dramatic 
break up (that would require an 
official relationship), but try to 
see her a lot less: don’t pick up 
her Facetime in the middle of the 
night; hang out where she’s not 
likely to be. Maybe don’t like her 
Instagrams. Your absence will be 
noticed and this girl will either 
accept it, in which case you can try 
to move on and meet someone else, 
or realize that maybe she wants to 
give a shot at being with you. In 
either case, you’ll be better off than 
as her Jake.

Whatever you do, don’t force 

her to choose like the guys in 
Spike Lee’s first film “She’s 
Gotta Have It.” Nola Darling, a 
confident Brooklyn girl with a sick 
apartment, loves to make love and 

takes what she wants from her 
rotation of three boy interests. 
These 
guys 
are 
pretty 
one-

dimensional and each fits into a 
singular “type.” Jamie Overstreet 
is polite, sensitive and possessive; 
Greer Childs is a narcissistic 
male-model; and Mars Blackmon 
(played by Spike) is a fast-talking 
jokester.

In the pseudo-documentary 

format of the film, the characters 
are interviewed about Nola and 
their 
relationships 
with 
her. 

Jamie: “to Nola we were all 
interchangeable, simply parts of 
a whole.” Greer: “You know in 
retrospect I can see that Nola saw 
me, Mars and Jamie as a whole. 
Not as three separate individuals 
, but as one organism. We let her 
create a three headed, six armed, 
six legged, three penised monster.”

Jamie eventually gives her an 

ultimatum and Nola is tricked into 
thinking she wants to commit and 
be with only him. But its doomed 
because these men can’t change 
the fact that Nola, like Lady Ashley, 
is the only one who can curate her 
love life. “It’s about control,” Nola 
says. “My body, my mind. Who’s 
going to own ’em, them? Or Me? I 
am not a one-man woman.” 

You don’t need to take a Women’s 

Studies class to know there are 
still double standards for men and 
women when it comes to their sex 
lives. The point here, South, is to 
avoid being judgmental, and keep 
any conversations you have on 
the personal level rather than the 
general and gendered.

So, Mr. South, my advice is to 

drop out of the web your Nola has 
created, don’t judge her for it, and 
definitely don’t try forcing her to 
choose if that’s not who she is. I 
believe she will come to you, but 
even if she doesn’t, you’ll be good 
in the long run.

Let me leave you with some 

pictures to look at while you’re on 
your This Girl sabbatical, which 
could be a while.

Gustave Klimt’s two paintings 

The Kiss and Tears: No matter 
how 
many 
sides 
your 
love 

polygon has, the simple cause 
and effect equation in Klimt’s 
symbolism, 
depicted 
in 
his 

signature gold leaf style, captures 
the raw emotion generated by 
envy and the mysteries of human 
sexuality.

And how about a Warhol 

Marilyn Diptych? After flitting 
from DiMaggio to Miller to Brando 
and on, all while enchanting with 
the entire western world, and 
squeezing in a president for good 
measure, you become a cloned icon 
of pop art irony.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 TDE has an incredible track 
record of posse cuts, ranging 
from Q’s “Say Wassup” to their 
“U.O.E.N.O” 
remix, and 
now we 
can add Jay 
Rock’s “Vice 
City” to the 
collection. 
Black Hippy, 
comprised 
of Jay Rock, 
Kendrick 
Lamar, 
Ab-Soul 
and Schoolboy Q, take turns 
using identical flows to pum-
mel a Cardo-produced beat in 
a fleshed out barn filled with 
strippers.
 Kendrick strikes first, 
wearing a sweater with news-
paper clippings about crime 
and his classic “i” hat, which 
is quickly turning into a strong 
“Compton superhero” look. 
Unlike his conscious raps 
from To Pimp a Butterfly, his 
verse here is basically a flex 

in the form of his booking fee. 
Fighting off four strippers 
that threaten to quarter him, 
this isn’t exactly the Kendrick 
we’re used to, but it’s undeni-
ably dope.
 Ab-soul was never going to 
have a traditional entrance, 
so it’s not surprising that he 
enters the video by jumping 
through a window that didn’t 
even exist a minute prior. In 
his classic Black-Einstein-
on-acid aesthetic, he wanders 
between stripper poles read-
ing books and throwing guaps 
at no one in particular. Also, 
there’s something vaguely 
Eazy E-esque about the way 
he swings a baseball bat with 
gloves.
 And then there’s Jay Rock 
himself, who spits his verse 
while lying down in a stretch-
er rolling through a makeshift 
stripper-runway. Definitely 
the most creatively directed 
shot in a rap video this year, if 
not the most hilariously lewd.
 Schoolboy Q closes out the 

show by standing in a spotlight 
and making fun of “weird” 
rappers who use “big words” 
like “philosophies.” You 
can’t help but wonder how Q 
works with someone like Ab-
Soul, given his encyclopedic 

vocabulary. Yet, as drastically 
different as the four of Black 
Hippy are in isolation, they 
have a seamless chemistry that 
produces hit after hit.
