CELEBRATING OUR ONE-HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Officer delivers first 
in-class presentation 
on shooter situations

By ANDREW ALMANI

Daily Staff Reporter

Inside Angell Hall last week, a 

lecture hall full of students took 
a break from earth science to dis-
cuss a very different topic — how 
to respond to an active shooter 
situation.

Officers from the University’s 

Department of Public Safety and 
Security delivered a presentation 
on active shooter safety guide-
lines during Prof. Brian Arbic’s 
Earth 222 lecture last Wednes-
day.

Though the active shooter pre-

sentation is not a component of 
the standard DPSS talk students 
hear during their first-year orien-
tation, DPSS provides the presen-
tation on a case-by-case basis to 
any University unit or person on 
campus who requests it.

Wednesday’s session was the 

first on the topic delivered to stu-
dents in a University classroom 
setting. Sgt. Gary Hicks, DPSS 
community outreach supervisor, 
led the presentation.

“Like most Americans, I’m 

concerned 
that 
these 
things 

do happen,” Arbic said. “Fac-
ulty members are encouraged to 
attend presentations by the police 
on an active shooter scenario. At 
one of these presentations I said 
to them, ‘I stand in front of 150 
students during my class, what 
about them?’ ”

Arbic said he plans to ask his 

students what they thought about 
the presentation when the term 
ends.

“I am very curious as to what 

the students thought,” Arbic said. 
“I know a few students appreci-
ated it because they came up and 
asked the police to do presenta-
tions at their sororities or organi-
zations.”

LSA sophomore Ian Hecker, 

a student in Arbic’s class, said 
the talk was a worthwhile use of 
time.

Journalist says 

Jewish-Americans 

are central to 
Israel’s future

By GEN HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

Ari Shavit, an Israeli author 

and columnist for the newspaper 
Haaretz, one of the nation’s most 
influential newspapers, spoke 
to a group of about 300 people 

in the Union on Tuesday about 
Israel’s political strife and the 
role Jewish-Americans can play 
in alleviating the country’s chal-
lenges. The University’s Hillel 
sponsored the event.

Throughout the lecture, Sha-

vit focused on three questions 
derived from his best-selling 
book, “My Promised Land”: 
“why Israel?,” “what Israel?,” and 
“will Israel?”

Audience 
members 
were 

organized into groups of 10 indi-
viduals. Each group was seated 
around a table and provided with 

a facilitator to lead discussion 
after Shavit’s responses to each 
of the three questions.

To address the first question, 

Shavit discussed why settlers 
founded Israel in the first place.

“They saw that the old reli-

gion-based anti-Semitism was 
replaced by a more dangerous 
race-based anti-Semitism,” he 
said. “So they saw the terrible 
hate and they realized they had 
to take action.”

Hillel executive director Tilly 

Shames said the interactive for-
mat allowed attendees to partici-

pate in the conversation.

“Too often, speakers come to 

campus and only three or four 
people have the opportunity to 
ask questions or have their voice 
heard,” she wrote in an e-mail 
interview. “We know that stu-
dents have a lot to say about 
Israel and we wanted to provide 
a space where they could express 
themselves, feel heard, and listen 
to others.”

While recognizing that the 

formation of a new country was 
a radical solution to avoid per-

$8,400 project 
will add 67 new 

charging stations to 

library tables

By LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

The Central Student Govern-

ment Assembly focused on two 
initiatives Tuesday night: enact-
ing its Winter 2015 budget and 
voting on a previously proposed 
resolution to increase the avail-
ability of power outlets in the 
Shapiro Undergraduate Library.

CSG treasurer Alex Abdun-

Nabi, an LSA senior, presented 
the budget. He said the budget 
currently totals $356,695, but 
may change after the add/drop 
deadline, when the number of 
students enrolled in courses is 
finalized.

In the last week, the finance 

committee reviewed a resolution 
to add 67 new power outlets to the 
UGLi, and returned the proposal 
with a few suggested changes 

that were ultimately approved.

The project was originally 

slated to cost $8,772 and would 
have used outlets that included 
USB ports.

LSA senior Jacob Ruby, chair 

of the finance committee, said 
the group decided that it would 
be more valuable to invest in 
units with four outlets rather 
than units with three outlets and 
one USB port. This decision sub-
sequently lowered the project’s 
cost to $8,400.

The 
finance 
committee 

approved installing the outlets as 
table fixtures, which Ruby said 
would be more sustainable than 
power strips.

“They should last for a long 

time,” Ruby said. “We should 
be able to get a lot of use out of 
them.”

Medical School representative 

Michael Yee motioned to post-
pone voting on the resolution 
because he did not feel comfort-
able voting without the project’s 
full budget breakdown in front of 
him.

After some debate, the resolu-

Wolverines 

overcome slow 

start with second-

half surge

By DANIEL FELDMAN

Daily Sports Editor

After hinting that a lineup 

change could occur, given that 
his team was “banged up,” 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
kept on his word Tuesday.

Despite giving it a go in 

warm-
ups, 
sopho-
more guard Derrick Walton Jr., 
who missed the last two days of 
practice due to further strain-
ing his foot in addition to an 
already strained toe, was held 
out against Nebraska.

In his place came freshman 

guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman, making just his sec-
ond career start.

With 
Michigan 
missing 

arguably its two best players 
— Walton and junior guard 
Caris LeVert — the question 

surrounding the team mainly 
revolved around who would 
step up to replace 25 points per 
game of production.

The 
problem 
was 
com-

pounded by the fact that the 
Cornhuskers (4-4, Big Ten, 
12-8 overall) had allowed fewer 
than 50 points in three of their 
four conference wins.

As it turned out, though, 

Michigan (6-3, 13-8) received 
22 points from the duo’s 
replacements in a 58-44 vic-
tory.

LGBTQ individuals and allies 

at the University gathered Tues-
day to discuss personal and pub-

students searching for employ-
ment.

The event was sponsored by 

Out in Public, a student organiza-
tion at the Ford School of Public 
Policy that seeks to facilitate dis-
cussion and provide support for 
LGBTQ issues.

Katie Dunn, a career counselor 

in the School of Information, dis-
cussed how to find organizations

Grad. student’s hybrid project 
shown at Detroit Auto Show

Vehicles combine 
durability of cars, 
energy of bicycles

BY ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

The Flintstones’ foot-operat-

ed vehicles may not be so archaic 
after all.

Cameron Van Dyke, a gradu-

ate student in the Penny W. 
Stamps School of Art & Design, 

is the creator of Future Cycles — 
bicycle-automobile hybrids that 
combine both the durability of a 
car and the low-energy cost of a 
bicycle. Two of his vehicles were 
featured in the Detroit Auto 
Show last week.

Van Dyke said his wife helped 

inspire the project, in which he 
designed two vehicles named 
“Cyclone” and “Zeppelin” as part 
of his master’s thesis.

“We’re both avid bicyclists, 

so the idea that we could create 
a vehicle that would allow us to 

do the bicycling that we enjoy 
but also get the things we needed 
out of a car was one of the main 
influences for the designs,” he 
said.

Van Dyke said one goal of 

the project was to create hybrid 
vehicles that would be accept-
ed in a transportation culture 
dominated by automobiles. This 
thinking influenced the design 
of “Cyclone,” which is meant to 
capture both the likeness of early 
modern vehicles and the style of 
vehicles today.

“I wanted to make something 

that is iconically car-like, so I 
began by looking at Model-T’s,” 
Van Dyke said. “I took some of 
what I saw, and meshed it with 
today’s current retro style of 
vehicles to make it look like it had 
been stamped out of a factory, 
and have a high level of finish.”

Van Dyke mainly worked 

alone 
to 
complete 
both 
of 

the Future Cycles, though he 
received grants from the School 
of Art & Design. His wife assist-
ed with design and maintains 
the Future Cycles website.

Van Dyke said he noticed the 

University’s Solar Car Team’s 
vehicle was on display while 
visiting the Auto Show in past 
years, so he decided to ask the 
event organizers for permission 
to display his Future Cycles. He 
said visitors to the show provid-
ed positive feedback.

“We talked to hundreds of 

people,” he said. “It was really 
encouraging. We found that peo-
ple were really interested in the 
vehicle because the idea that you 
could drive a cheaper vehicle, 
save money and have a health 
benefit seemed to really resonate 
with a lot of people.”

For now, Van Dyke says he is 

focused on completing his thesis 
for his master’s degree, though 
attending the Detroit Auto Show 
helped him brainstorm ideas 
for new potential Future Cycles 
designs.

Both of the Future Cycles 

vehicles will be on display in the 
Duderstadt Center gallery on 
North Campus starting Feb. 24.

NAVIGATING JOBS
CAMPUS ACTIVISM

Students at the University of 

California, Berkeley painted the 
“Big C” — a large letter C engraved 
in a hill near the campus — red, 
green and black Monday in soli-
darity with recent movements 
in the Black community against 
racial profiling and police brutali-
ty, The Daily Californian reported.

Berkeley’s Black Student Union 

helped organize the painting and 
coordinated the colors to match 
those of the Pan-African flag.

Gabrielle Shuman, co-chair of 

political affairs for the BSU, said 
the gesture was in part a response 
to a campus climate survey that 
reportedly states that 50 percent 
of Black students feel “prejudged 
by faculty based on their identity/
background.”

“It’s just a proud moment for us 

to be able to see, ‘Wow, we claimed 
that space,’ ” Shuman said of paint-
ing the Big C. “Obviously, painting 
some colors isn’t going to drasti-
cally change anything — it’s not 
going to solve all our problems or 
necessarily accomplish all of our 
goals. For us, this is really a sym-
bolic thing.”

Northwestern admissions 

to engage with Native 
American community 

Northwestern University will 

begin efforts to improve its rela-
tionship with Native American 
communities by, among other ini-
tiatives, having its Office of Under-
graduate Admission reach out to 
Native American students, The 

Daily Northwestern wrote Mon-
day.

This change comes in response 

to a report submitted by the uni-
versity’s Native American Out-
reach and Inclusion Task Force, 
which was submitted to Provost 
Daniel Linzer and University Pres-
ident Morton Schapiro in Novem-
ber. It includes recommendations 
on how the university can improve 
its relationship with Native Ameri-
can communities.

“We’re moving ahead on pret-

ty much all of these initiatives,” 
Linzer said. “The recommenda-
tions were a great list of things to 
look at, and we’re working with 
the schools and the deans and fac-
ulty and admissions.”

Yoruba Richen 

discussed her new 

documentary, 
‘The New Black’

BY EMILY MIILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

Award-winning documentary 

filmmaker 
Yoruba 
Richen 

spoke 
Tuesday 
as 
part 
of 

the 
University’s 
month-long 

symposium honoring Martin 
Luther King, Jr.

Inside 
the 
Michigan 

League, Richen discussed her 
documentary, “The New Black,” 
which examines homophobia 
in the Black community and 
follows both people who support 
and 
oppose 
LGBTQ 
rights 

within the community. 

Throughout 
the 
lecture, 

which was sponsored by the LSA 
Campus Climate Committee, 
Richen 
emphasized 
the 

importance of campus activism 
for issues pertaining to race and 
sexuality.

She said she hopes her new 

film increases awareness of 
these 
issues 
and 
promotes 

community inclusivity.

“We all exist in the microcosm 

of the larger culture,” Richen 
said. “What may seem like a 
small pocket of resistance in an 
isolated community or a small 
town or a single university 
campus can help ignite so much 
more.”

She described the nationwide 

spread of last year’s Being 
Black 
at 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan movement, nationally 
recognized 
for 
its 
#BBUM 

Twitter 
campaign, 
as 
an 

example of the ways in which 
campus activism can influence 
the national conversation on 
race. She also said the rise of by 
protests against police brutality 
across the country exemplify 
this power.

Richen said she hopes her film 

is used to reach out to the Black 
and LGBTQ communities.

“One can at least try to 

foster change, try to be more 
understanding,” she said. “That’s 
what we all want: to be seen, 
heard, accepted and respected.”

She 
also 
reflected 
on 

King’s activism around issues 
pertaining 
to 
socioeconomic 

class and militarization of the 
government in addition to his 
fight for racial equality.

“He was looking in a new, 

more radical direction, and the 

scope of his vision was wider 
than it had ever been,” Richen 
said. “That is the example that 
I think we as citizens should try 
to follow, one that recognizes 
that we are many, many diverse 
things and that all of them 
deserve respect, acceptance and 
full protection at this University 
and under the law.”

LSA senior Youran Gui said 

Richen’s emphasis on LGBTQ 
activism resonated with her 
experiences as an international 
student.

“In Asia, they always hide 

the fact that they’re LGBTQ, 
they never told their friends or 
their parents,” Gui said. “It’s 
really touching. It’s also really 
refreshing to see that kind of 
documentary that can actually 
raise people’s awareness.”

Joe 
Salvatore, 
an 
event 

organizer and associate director 
of 
the 
University’s 
Science 

Learning Center, said he hopes 
the lecture inspired students to 
work towards a more inclusive 
campus environment.

“We’re all trying to build a 

better community at Michigan,” 
Salvatore said. “We all want a 
community that’s welcoming 
and inclusive because that makes 
for a better Michigan and a 
better experience for everyone.”

secution, Shavit said the deci-
sion by many Jews to emigrate 
from one continent to another 
was the only way to respond to 
persecution and anti-Semitism 
in Europe.

“We need a place that is a 

powerhouse for modern, Jew-
ish identity,” he said. “That’s 
why Israel was needed, that is 
why Israel is needed, that is why 
Israel will be needed, and this is 
so relevant to young, American 
Jews.”

Shavit stressed how impres-

sive he believed Israel’s concep-
tion was, noting that it required 
“political genius” and sacri-
fice to create a homeland for 
the Jewish community. Israel 
declared independence in 1948.

However, 
he 
criticized 

modern Israeli politicians for 
alienating young people and 
abandoning the idea of a demo-
cratic Jewish state.

He said the left and right 

wings have failed to deliver 
hope to the Israelis, an ideal 
which served former U.S. Presi-
dent Bill Clinton well when he 
moderated peace talks between 
the Israelis and the Palestin-
ians.

“The one person who had a 

landslide victory in Israel is Bill 
Clinton,” Shavit said. “He was 
so popular because we felt he 
loved us, and he gave people the 

sense of good-willage that they 
never got from our own leader-
ship.”

While discussing the array of 

challenges facing Israel, Shavit 
said the most difficult stem from 
conflicting 
political 
factions 

within Israel and their inability 
to find common ground.

“In my mind, the greatest 

challenge within Israel is to cre-
ate a new kind of republic that 
has a kind of pluralistic unity, 
that respects individual rights, 
that respects each one of these 
minorities, but creates a kind 
of federation of these different 
tribes,” Shavit said.

Beyond internal issues, Shavit 

said developing better relations 
with the West, other Middle 
Eastern countries and Palestine 
is imperative to Israel’s survival.

“There 
is 
nothing 
more 

important than refueling and 
reenergizing the relationship 
between 
Israel 
and 
young, 

American Jews,” Shavit said. 
“We are totally interdepen-
dent, we will not have a future 
without you, you will not have a 
future without us.”

Shavit called upon the young 

Jewish community to create a 
new, energetic and more liberal 
form of Zionism.

“Only liberal Zionism will 

give us the meaning, the social 
justice (and) social cohesion 
in Israel,” Shavit said. “Only 
that will give them the energy, 
the tools and the confidence to 
belong to our people, to be proud 

of our people and to protect the 
future of our people.”

LSA freshman Emilie Weis-

berg said tensions about Israeli 
policies on campus motivated 
her to attend the lecture.

Last semester, the University 

student group Students Allied 
for Freedom and Equality lob-
bied Central Student Govern-
ment to support a resolution 
calling on the University to 
divest from companies allegedly 
involved in human rights viola-
tions against Palestinians. The 
resolution did not pass.

Weisberg 
said 
she 
was 

impressed 
by 
Shavit’s 
call 

for 
young 
Jewish-American 

involvement in Israel.

“I really wanted to get some 

more information on how we 
can help be more supportive of 
Israel on campus,” Weisberg 
said. “People of the United 
States often feel that they don’t 
have anything valuable to add 
to an Israeli conversation and I 
think his stress on how impor-
tant it is for Americans to have a 
say was really inspirational.”

“The presentation definitely 

better prepared me to react in 
emergency situations,” Hecker 
said. “The frightening rise of mass 
shootings is a real threat, and the 
updated information included in 
the presentation is vital for react-
ing to emergency situations.”

“I absolutely think this is some-

thing every student should see,” 
he added. “I feel more prepared 
to react to emergency situations 
after watching the presentation.”

Shootings at universities and 

colleges have attracted wide-
spread 
national 
attention 
in 

recent years after a series of 
high-profile incidents. In May, a 
shooter at the University of Cali-
fornia, Santa Barbara, killed six 
students.

In February 2013, reports of 

a student wearing fatigues, a gas 
mask and an ammunition pack 
inside Angell Hall resulted in an 
armed police response.

University Police Officer Mat-

thew Butzky, who designed the 
presentation, said DPSS is looking 
for ways to make the information 
more accessible to students out-
side of a formal lecture setting, 
though in-person interaction is 
preferable.

“One of the things I’m work-

ing on right now is getting an 

abbreviated version of this avail-
able on our website and direct-
ing students to look at it so they 
have the basic structure there,” 
he said. “Certainly, I would like to 
get it out to more students. More 
face-time with students is always 
a good thing.”

He added that there are numer-

ous other training programs 
available, the most prevalent of 
which is the Alert, Lockdown, 
Inform, Counter, Evacuate pro-
gram, known as ALICE, but most 
include similar content.

Wednesday’s 
presentation 

focused on “run, hide, fight,” a 
direction Butzky said is easy to 
remember and straightforward, 
similar to the guidance “stop, 
drop and roll.”

“It’s all about options,” he said. 

“In situations like this, there’s no 
one right thing to do, there’s no 
magic bullet or magic solution, 
it’s all about having options and 
taking some action. The days are 
gone, back in the day we thought 
it would was a good idea to just 
try to lockdown. Traditional 
lockdown is not a good option for 
these types of scenarios.”

Butzky said DPSS hopes to 

increase the program’s reach.

“There’s certainly support at a 

number of levels to get the active 
shooter presentation out to every-
one,” Butzky said. “We’d love to 
have every student, faculty and 
staff member get it.”

Dawkins stepped up in the first 
half, scoring 13 points. However, 
Michigan scored just 23 points in 
the period, with contributions of 
four and six points, respectively, 
from senior forward Max Bielfeldt 
and sophomore forward Zak Irvin. 
While the Wolverines maintained 
a five-point lead heading into half-
time, it was evident that a win 
would require others to contribute.

In the second half, the scoring 

disparity drastically changed for 
the Wolverines. Michigan opened 
the half with a 15-2 run while 
spreading the wealth around.

Freshman forward Ricky Doyle 

used his body down low for two 
baskets, Irvin knocked down two 
jumpers — including his third tri-
ple of the game — and junior guard 
Spike Albrecht knocked down a 
pair of free throws.

But perhaps the brightest spark 

of the night was provided by Wal-
ton’s replacement: Abdur-Rahk-
man.

By creating space in the open 

court numerous times, Abdur-
Rahkman scored nine points in 
the second half. With speed on his 
side, he pushed the ball in transi-
tion, drove to the basket himself 
twice in the early stages of the 
frame and turned what was a slow-
paced, sloppy affair into an enter-
taining game.

“You’ve got Muhammad mak-

ing big drives and already playing 
(the role of) a veteran point guard 
in some aspects,” Bielfeldt said.

Added Beilein: “He can just run 

by people on the fast break. And he 
doesn’t even know he’s doing it. We 

like that speed.”

As Dawkins and Abdur-Rahk-

man filled the load for the missing 
Wolverines, the remaining vet-
erans stepped up to close out the 
game.

Posting 
a 
career-high 
12 

rebounds to go along with a team-
high 14 points, Irvin put the game 
on ice with 3:44 left when his 
off-balance jumper coupled with 
a hack on the arm fell to push 
Michigan’s lead to 13. Next came 
an Albrecht pass to a wide-open 
Bielfeldt for a dunk as the shot 
clock was about to expire. Bielfeldt 
finished with 12 points and nine 
rebounds, a career high that stood 
out even more because of redshirt 
freshman forward Mark Donnal’s 
absence due to sickness.

While Michigan had its replace-

ments, and then veterans, step up 
in the second half to close out the 
game, Miles noted the Cornhusk-
ers’ inability to knock down cor-
ner triples, a result of Michigan’s 
zone defense as another key to the 
result.

Nebraska’s one-two punch of 

forward Shavon Shields and guard 
Terran Petteway combined to go 
5-for-23 from the field and 2-for-11 
from behind the arc.

“Whenever your best players 

struggle, especially on a team that 
has two scorers, we’re going to 
struggle,” Miles said.

Though the atrocious shoot-

ing didn’t help the Cornhuskers’ 
cause, Miles pointed to another 
reason for his team’s struggles and 
Michigan’s victory.

“I just thought that the urgency 

of Michigan on both ends of the 
floor was greater than our urgency 
on either side of the floor,” he said.

discrimination based on sexual 
orientation, and 18 of them also 
have protections for gender 
identity. 
Michigan 
currently 

does not employ any of those 
protections.

An executive order signed 

in 2004 by former Democratic 
governor Jennifer Granholm 
prohibits discrimination based 
on sexual orientation and gen-
der identity for public employ-
ees.

Two proposed amendments 

to include protection of sex-
ual orientation in Michigan’s 
Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act 
— which prohibits discrimina-
tion in the workplace, public 
places and housing markets — 
failed to pass a House commit-
tee last December.

In his State of the State 

address earlier this month, 
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder 
called for renewed debate on 
the issue.

“If you are working for a 

private company in Michigan, 
it is perfectly legal for that 
company to fire you based on 
actual or perceived sexual ori-
entation or gender identity,” 
Dunn said. “There is really no 
legal recourse for you to take.”

Following 
the 
presenta-

tion, attendees and panelists 
discussed issues of self-pre-
sentation, workplace culture 
and personal experiences as an 
LGBTQ person navigating the 
job-search process.

The discussion explored the 

extent to which an individual 
should reveal their sexual ori-
entation or gender identity dur-
ing the job-search process and 
in the workplace.

Dunn said there is no right 

answer as to whether one 
should disclose sexual orien-
tation or gender identity in a 
resume or during an interview. 
She emphasized that what feels 
comfortable and authentic var-
ies on an individual basis.

Kristi Gainey, an intern coor-

dinator for Thomson Reuters 
who identifies as a straight ally 
to LGBTQ persons, said that if 
someone has leadership experi-
ence in LGBTQ-related activi-
ties, it should be included in his 
or her resume.

“You don’t want to sell your-

self short by excluding things 
that show you bring value,” 
Gainey said.

Panelist Jonathan Moore, a 

University alum and current 
special assistant to the assistant 
secretary at the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human 
Services, 
said 
he 
includes 

his sexual orientation on his 

resume and addresses the issue 
if it comes up in interviews. He 
said he hopes employers evalu-
ate him based on his skills, not 
his identification as a gay male.

Students 
also 
discussed 

how to gauge whether poten-
tial employers are inclusive of 
LGBTQ individuals.

Gainey 
said 
job 
seekers 

should research whether a com-
pany’s anti-discrimination poli-
cies include sexual orientation 
and gender identity, as well as if 
benefits are available for trans-
gender individuals and those in 
same-sex partnerships.

Cortney Turner, a Univer-

sity assistant research scientist 
and a panelist at the event, said 
a company might be inclusive 
if potential employers value 
diversity as an important aspect 
of the company’s culture.

Panelists also discussed how 

to find supportive mentors and 
peers who identify as LGBTQ 
or are allies, and how to address 
hostility, stereotyping and pos-
sible 
discrimination 
in 
the 

workplace.

“Ultimately, being gay or les-

bian will be a non-issue,” said 
David Michener, a panelist and 
associate curator at the Univer-
sity’s Matthei Botanical Gar-
dens and Nichols Arboretum. 
“That’s the society we are work-
ing towards.”

Ex-Vanderbilt

Gunman clashes 
with police outside 
council meeting

A man killed in a confronta-

son said Tuesday.

Two officers were wounded in

day night.

The man who carried an 

unspecified long gun was iden-

Belle Plaine, by his son, Nathan 
Kmetz and the Hennepin Coun-
ty medical examiner. Raymond 
Kmetz’s disputes with the city 
dated back to at least 2008, and 
his son told The Associated Press 
that his father blamed authori-
ties for the loss of his home and 
contracting business.

Secret talks in 
Jordan try to win

Japanese officials were tight-

lipped Wednesday as secret talks 
in Jordan sought to secure the

by Islamic State extremists and 
purportedly 
threatened 
with 

death within 24 hours.

The global efforts to free Jap-

apparent ultimatum from the 
Islamic State group.

In the message, the extrem-

H

ey bae, we need to talk about 
how you pulled your music from 
 

Spotify.

I remember it happen-

ing. I was on a bench at my 
college’s gym, and I heard 
the ending melody of T.I.’s 
“No Mediocre.” I’ve spent 
enough time immersed 
in my workout playlist to 
know “Shake It Off” comes 
next. Or, well, that’s what 
should’ve happened.

As you well know, I 

wasn’t met with a force-
ful “I stay out too late,” 
because you decided to pull the entirety of your 
music collection from Spotify.

Intrigued after my workout, I set off on 

an Internet search to get to the bottom of 
why you did this. I came across my answer 
 

pretty quickly.

In your recent Wall Street Journal article, 

you said, “Music is art, and art is important 
and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. 
Valuable things should be paid for. It’s my 
opinion that music should not be free.”

This clearly references the idea that Spotify 

is a free service for non-Premium members, 
and since these members can listen to your 
music for free, they’re not providing financial 
worth to your art.

I see your point, and as a concept, it 

makes sense to me. Music is art, and you 
want your art to be held to a standard that 
 

reflects compensation.

But pulling your Spotify catalog isn’t help-

ing you.

You’re turning a blind eye to the reality that 

not all of your fans can afford a $12 album. To 
a celebrity in your financial standing, it may be 
difficult to envision, but trust me — it’s a reality 
that many of us face. When you’re poor, $12 can 
genuinely be the difference between whether 
you have enough grocery money for the week.

It also doesn’t help that your audience is 

most susceptible to being broke. I don’t think 
you need statistics to know a huge chunk of 
your fans are teenagers, college students and 
20-something recent college graduates. If 
teenage and college students come from low-
income families, they may not have the money 
to spend on an album. Recent college gradu-
ates are also making the lowest salaries in 
their lives and are likely paying back expensive 
 

student loans.

Plus, consider if every artist follows your 

precedent. If listening to an artist’s album 
required a $12 prerequisite, how reasonable 
would it be for anyone of low socioeconomic 
status to keep up with artists?

Yes, your music is art and deserves rea-

sonable compensation, but the reasonable 
compensation should be scaled to a person’s 
background. Music isn’t like fine art hung in 
the living rooms of affluent homeowners; it’s 
an inherent cultural underpinning to our soci-
ety. Almost everyone listens to music. We’re 
bombarded by it on our computers, radios, 
offices, headphones, parties and daily con-
versations. In the same way that you deserve 
universal compensation for music, society 

An open letter to Taylor Swift

A

s we watch the snow from 
inside our homes curled 
up next to the fireplace 

or hurry to get 
from 
one 
class 

to the next, it’s 
easy to forget the 
people 
suffer-

ing from home-
lessness right in 
our 
own 
back-

yards. According 
to the National 
Coalition 
for 

the 
Homeless, 

people 
can 
die 

from 
hypother-

mia when the temperature is as 
low as 50 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Michigan winters get much lower 
than this, and last winter had the 
lowest 
recorded 
temperatures 
 

since 1977-78.

A year ago, as people scrambled 

to find somewhere warm to stay 
because of the harsh winter con-
ditions, the shelters in Ann Arbor 
struggled to accommodate them.

I 
had 
the 
opportunity 
to 

interview Ellen Schulmeister, the 
executive director of the Shelter 
Association of Washtenaw County, 
who described how severe the 
 

shelter conditions were.

According to Schulmeister, “Last 

winter was really bad and we had a 
40 percent increase in the number 
of people that we saw coming into 
our winter programs.”

“That was a huge increase for us 

to absorb and we really didn’t have 
the space in here. For the first time 
in the 11 years that we have been 
here we were putting people on all 
of our floors,” she said.

The Ann Arbor City Council has 

taken steps to fix some of these 

problems, like investing money into 
the Delonis Center, a Washtenaw 
County homeless center, as well as 
supporting other daytime warming 
shelters. Schulmeister commented 
on how the Delonis center helps.

“It’s going to help us provide more 

comfortable space for the people that 
come in so we’ll have an overflow for 
night time at a different location,” 
Schulmeister explained. “We will 
also have extra day places where 
people can actually be during the 
daytime.” She also said that although 
they usually focus their energy on 
finding affordable housing, during 
the winter the focus is to find “life-
saving shelter.”

The Ann Arbor City Council also 

recently approved a resolution stat-
ing that police would only remove 
people from camping on public or 
private property if they received 
complaints. The resolution claims “it 
is not the practice of the City of Ann 
Arbor to proactively seek out home-
less camps for removal, nor to broad-
ly deploy strategies to render areas 
used as campsites unusable.” Some 
councilmembers, including Coun-
cilmember Jack Eaton (D–Ward 4), 
believe that this resolution ignores 
some of the greater issues facing the 
homeless, like the need for afford-
able housing and other service.

It’s possible that the reason they 

do not want to actively seek peo-
ple living in these encampments is 
because they fear there are too many 
homeless people to absorb in the cur-
rent homeless shelters. This may lead 
to greater problems, but it also means 
that the Ann Arbor City Council 
needs to focus on addressing these 
issues as well as trying to get people 
out of homelessness and thinking of 
better long-term solutions.

People who suffer from home-

lessness face a stigma that creates 
another obstacle. Often people see 
a homeless person asking for money 
and assume they’re just going to 
use it on alcohol or that the reason 
they are homeless is because they 
are lazy. This makes them hesitant 
to help, without realizing that the 
consequence of this stigma is that it 
could lead to death, especially dur-
ing these harsh winter conditions.

In 
regards 
to 
why 
helping 

the 
homeless 
is 
important, 

Schulmeister said, “I understand 
when people don’t want to spend a 
lot of money, but there comes a time 
where someone’s actual life is at 
risk, and this is one of those times 
and that’s the best reason to help at 
least during this time.”

Helping may not necessarily 

mean one concrete solution. There 
are ways to help by providing 
monetary donations to the shelters 
themselves, but if people prefer 
that the money goes directly to the 
homeless, the Shelter Association 
of Washtenaw County also takes 
gift cards that go directly to buying 
new items for the homeless. They 
are always in need of volunteers, 
especially in the winter. They do 
not have the facilities to take used 
clothing because they need to keep 
bedbugs out of the shelters, as they 
can create major problems.

In the long term, getting people 

off the streets and into affordable 
housing is ideal, but this transition 
out of homelessness is very diffi-
cult, especially for those with fami-
lies. They at least deserve a chance 
at survival.

A chance for survival

F

or some, sports, television shows, 
comic fandoms or celebrity tweets con-
jure moments of irrational enjoyment 

when individuals spontane-
ously shed layers of formal-
ity and reveal small hidden 
passions. In my case, I have 
a penchant for words in 
their most rhythmic forms. 
I’m a bit of a music addict 
and a poetry nerd. Wheth-
er it’s song lyrics or stan-
zas of poetry, deciphering 
the multitude of possible 
meanings 
sparks 
excite-

ment within me. When my 
friend 
unenthusiastically 

informed me the curriculum for his creative 
writing class included a unit of reading and 
writing poetry, I gleefully interrogated him. 
His phone swiftly became the recipient of an 
onslaught of text messages inquiring whose 
work he’d be reading, what types of poetry 
and if we could exchange the titles of inter-
esting poems we encountered, since I’m cur-
rently taking a poetry course myself.

Now may be an opportune moment to 

casually remind you of that nerd status I 
 

previously mentioned.

Last week as I sat in the League doing 

homework, my friend surprisingly complied 
with my overeager request. He texted me a 
poem by Anne Sexton titled “In Celebration 
of My Uterus.” The title was odd, yet intrigu-
ing. My first instinct — after an initial glance 
— was to reply with a sarcastic remark, con-
sidering I could think of a monthly occur-
rence that would dissuade me from such a 
celebration. However, my sarcasm dissipated 
as I delved into the language of the poem. Ini-
tially, the speaker discusses the possibility 
of removing a physiological marker of what 
makes her a woman — her uterus. Though 
a signifier of her sex was deemed tainted or 
useless, the speaker acknowledges that her 
value as both an individual and as a woman 
is not lessened in any way. The poem, instead, 
expands and transforms into a description of 
womanhood and the multitude of its magnifi-
cent variations.

While there are probably numerous inter-

pretations of the work and a myriad of aspects 
I haven’t mulled over yet, two lines, in par-
ticular, struck me. Sexton, in the first stanza, 
writes “They said you were immeasurably 
empty/but you are not.”

Women, in our society, are continu-

ally impressed with the notion that we are 
“immeasurably empty” in some way. Woman-
hood far too often translates into weakness 
— whether it’s emotionally, intellectually, 
physically or professionally. Even in the 
realm of academia, femininity is incorrectly 
construed as an indicator of deficiency. The 
multitude of degree holders, from bachelor’s 
to doctoral degrees, is comprised of women, 
but a study found academic fields that “most 
valued sheer intellectual brilliance such as 
philosophy, physics and math were the most 
likely to have fewer women in their ranks.”

In these male-dominated fields, innate 

genius is unreasonably portrayed as part of 
the job description. According to Sarah-Jane 
Leslie, professor of philosophy at Princeton 
University, one of the leaders of the study, 
“The problem lies not with women’s aptitude 
but with the ‘brilliance required’ attitude.”

In further coverage, Leslie elaborated 

on how the establishment of this unrealis-
tic expectation merges with long-instilled 
gender-stereotypes and deters women from 
participating in certain academic disciplines.

The automatic societal assumption is that 

women lack the knowledge or technical skills 
to participate in male-dominated profes-
sions and areas of study. Society imbues us 
with the assumption that women are devoid 
of rationality and logic, and possessing femi-
nine characteristics can hinder professional 
progress. The only way to counteract the 
negative effects of appearing too feminine 
in the workplace — according to a 2011 study 
conducted by the Stanford Graduate School 
of Business — is for women to “self-monitor” 
their behavior and “simultaneously present” 
both masculine and feminine traits. Women 
who are able to maneuver themselves across a 
tightrope strung between stereotypical con-
structs of masculinity and femininity obtain 
more promotions, according to the results of 
the study.

However, new research coincides more 

with the ideas I encountered in Sexton’s 
poem. While supposed signifiers of woman-
hood are misconstrued as undesirable or 
problematic, the shifting atmospheres of the 
contemporary workplace and classroom may 
soon reveal more of the exemplary merits of 
women. More and more, we’re living in a col-
laborative society where the ability to work 
in groups is crucial to accomplishing profes-
sional goals in every field of study.

In a recent study conducted by research-

ers from MIT, Carnegie Mellon and Union 
College, the “average social sensitivity of 
group members” was deemed as a crucial 
component in creating the smartest groups. 
Individuals with higher levels of social sen-
sitivity are more capable of deciphering the 
tone and facial cues of their colleagues, and 
women tend to display higher levels of “social 
sensitivity.” As a result, the findings suggest 
groups composed of a larger proportion of 
women performed better than groups of men 
in the study.

Just as Sexton’s poem concludes with a 

listing of women participating in various 
activities, ranging from studying the cardio-
vascular tissue to straddling a cello in Russia 
to examining the angular distance of meteors, 
intelligence is as diverse as the pursuits that 
require it and the people who pursue it. Bril-
liance is not restricted to one gender or one 
group. Levels of intelligence are expressed 
by a variation of degrees; no one type is 
superior. Rather than using intelligence 
to create boundaries for ourselves, society 
should revel in the intellectual diversity of 
 

each individual.

deserves universal access to it.

Lack of access is downright 

crippling. In the case of mega stars 
like you who are frequently a topic 
of conversation, lack of access 
restricts our knowledge of basic 
information. It also creates a barrier 
for the general enjoyment of the arts, 
something I’m sure you don’t want.

So let’s figure out a way that we 

both can get what we want. I’ve 
prepared three options that I believe 
can make us both happy.

First, I’d like you to consider the 

idea of putting your catalogue back 
on Spotify. Seventy percent of their 
profits go to music labels, so they do 
care about artists making money. 
With Spotify increasing as a brand, 
it will generate more revenue and 
therefore compensate artists like 
you more. It may never become as 
significant as album sales, but it has 
the potential to become more signifi-
cant. I promise.

Now, you may think this leaves 

a hole in your demand: non-
Premium users aren’t financially 
compensating you for your art. 
While they wouldn’t be paying you 
money, they would pay costs to listen 
to your music. In my economics 
classes, we often talk about costs 
lying outside the financial. If a user 
isn’t paying for Premium, they must 
listen to commercials while online. 
Those interested in listening to your 
art must pay a cost of listening to ads 
— paying with their literal time — to 
hear your music. Maybe it’s not the 

form of compensation you’re looking 
for, but I think it’s a valuable one if 
you meditate on it.

Second, you could work a deal with 

Spotify so only Premium subscribers 
could hear your music. Those that 
have a premium subscription have 
to pay $10 a month, so if only those 
members could listen to your music, 
they would indirectly pay for your 
music. Though this could be a diffi-
cult cost for lower-SES subscribers, 
it’s a stronger alternative than the 
idea of each person having to pay 
more than that for every album.

Third, if you really insist that 

people make a direct and intentional 
payment for your art, you could use a 
“pay what you can” method. Instead 
of a flat cost, your online site could 
have a sales section where the user 
inputs the price they pay. You could 
include a suggested dollar donation 
as the store price, and you could also 
require a $1 minimum. This way, you 
get paid for your art and people can 
afford to purchase it.

Plus, I don’t think this would lead 

to everyone paying $1 for albums. 
Businesses like Panera Bread have 
incorporated 
pay-what-you-can 

methods and make approximately 75 
percent of the list price. The time it 
would take to ship CDs would also 
cause people who can afford your 
album to buy it in stores. It would 
just provide your fans, that are 
struggling, with an alternative to 
still hear your music, and those that 
really love it would pay you more.

And luckily, you don’t have to 

worry about missing that 25 percent 
profit 
because 
you’re 
a 
multi-

millionaire. You never have to worry 
about being so poor at 15 that asking 
for a green pepper starts a fight 
with your family because someone 
doesn’t think it’s affordable.

People paying less than the album 

price for your art may not be the 
most ideal situation, but think about 
the alternatives. Though your album 
sold so well, at 3.66 million copies in 
2014, we both know that significant-
ly more people in our country of 320 
million people own your album. Ille-
gal streaming and sharing CDs are 
simplistic and reliable methods that 
people can use to get music. Since 
people will utilize these options 
when they can’t afford your music, 
providing 
cheaper 
opportunities 

could serve as a compromise that 
gets everyone what they want.

Taylor, I’ve been a fan of yours 

since I was 12 years old. I lay on my 
blue and yellow comforter listening 
to “Teardrops On My Guitar.” At 15, 
“You Belong With Me” became my 
anthem as I developed a crush on 
someone who didn’t reciprocate the 
feeling. “22” became the jam that 
helped glue the highlights of a col-
lege road trip in my heart.

So please, don’t leave a blank 

space in my memories where 1989 
should go.

Aziz Ansari will 
text your boy-toy

‘Parks and Rec’ star 
brings a hilarious set 
to Masonic Temple 

By KAREN HUA

Daily TV/New Media Editor

This past Sunday, Aziz Ansari 

graced us with his presence at a 
jam-packed Masonic Temple in 
Detroit. Just a day after tickets 
were released for sale last month, 
we all had to scramble to find 
a pair of decent seats. Glancing 
around before the show, I noticed 
the eclectic demographic of the 
audience ranged from older mar-
ried couples, college hooligans 
and average middle-aged friends.

Ansari is best known for his 

endearingly eccentric character, 
Tom Haverford, on the lauded 
hit show “Parks and Recreation.” 
As a person and stand-up comic, 
though, Ansari does not stray too 
far from Tom’s persona, as if they 
are almost one and the same.

Even before he appeared on 

stage, Ansari’s familiar, chipper 
voice warmly welcomed us in 
from the cold. He kindly asked 
us (as his alter ego Manager Egg-
plant Parmesan) to turn off our 
devices — or else “walk out the 
doors and get hit by a fucking 
bus.”

To open was Twitter-extraor-

dinaire, “Parks and Rec” and 
“Kroll Show” writer Joe Mande, 
who has been following Ansari 
on tour thus far. Though his 
mockery of Detroit was tasteful, 
and his story about Mike Hucka-
bee was quite funny, his general 
stage presence felt lethargic com-
pared to the hyper vibes we were 
anticipating from Ansari. He was 
slightly stoic in a way that did not 
completely compliment his mate-
rial — but we had to keep in mind 
that he is primarily a writer, not a 
performer. Nevertheless, Mande 
was what an opener is supposed 
to be — a warm-up to prepare the 
audience for hilarity to ensue.

Finally, Ansari sauntered confi-

dently onto the stage, classic Aziz-
smirk on his face, standing tall (or 
short) in his crisp, black suit. Even 
if he had not prepared material, 
Ansari would have been enter-
taining by the sole nature of his 
peppy, energetic attitude. He had 
an effortlessness with the mic, a 
familiarity with live laughter of 
this magnitude — and a complete 
unashamed, audacious ability to 
be a bit vulgar — especially when 
he mimed jerking off into the the-
ater.

Despite his call for no technol-

ogy, Ansari actually prompted the 
use of our cell phones during his 
set. He understood that restrain-
ing photos and messaging during 
the hour would be impossible — 
especially for a crowd of millen-
nials (and wannabe-millennial 
grandmas also addicted to tech-
nology). To combat this inevitabil-
ity, he posed and encouraged the 
audience to get the flash photog-
raphy out of its system. Though 
hesitant about the legitimacy of 
Ansari’s invitation, the audience 
couldn’t deny a free photo op from 
the cheeky comedian and his 
mile-wide smile.

Ansari seamlessly melded a 

casual, conversational effect with 
his formal content. There was 
structure in his set, but he was 
also such a brilliant improviser 
that his material never felt forced 
or stale even after repetition to 
other tour cities already.

Ansari started by speaking 

about his first-generation Ameri-
can status, an identity many audi-
ence members also shared. He 
progressed to discussion about 
how life for women was undeni-
ably so much harder — and he 
spoke so ludicrously about the 
ridiculous expectations of men 
that he perfectly painted what 
was wrong with gender roles. His 
jokes were incredibly relatable 
and reminded us of our privilege. 
He emphasized these concepts 
by feigning voices of naiveté — 
enunciating how preposterous we 
sound with our first world prob-
lems.

Finally, he addressed a promi-

nent issue with social media 
— how we create our own convo-
lutions in our relationships. This 
was certainly Ansari’s best section 
in terms of comedic writing — and 
he also received the most audi-

ence reception as we all hurled 
over in laughter. Ansari allowed 
us to laugh at our own hypocriti-
cal natures — as he pointed out 
how we expect a candor we our-
selves withhold — showing how 
we perpetuate our own demented 
dating culture.

Just as he persistently polled 

and questioned the audience 
throughout the night, he fur-
thered his audience interaction 
by asking people to come forward 
with their personal romantic text 
messages. Much to our shock, 
he proceeded to read aloud all 
of one woman’s messages with 
her current boy-toy — basically 
shitting on their conversation. 
He commented on every awk-
ward moment, poked fun at their 
excessive use of “LOL,” and ulti-
mately demonstrated how our 
ability to converse comfortably 
has declined so much, even with 
the advent of advanced technol-
ogy. Finally, he proceeded to send 
a text back to her boy – one single 
top-hat emoji. He reassured her, 
“Don’t worry — just tell him Aziz 
sent that text.”

What Ansari does so brilliantly 

is create genuine social commen-
tary, allowing us to contemplate 
our own privilege and habits. 
However, he is precise with his 
comedic timing, making sure to 
interject any sentimental sincerity 
with a crude joke before the atmo-
sphere becomes too dismal.

At heart, Ansari is a feminist 

and social justice activist. But 
unlike typical activists, he uses 
comedy to convey his message. 
By laughing at ourselves and our 
own contradictory natures, we are 
able to fundamentally see what is 
wrong with ourselves. Humor pro-
vides just the right amount of con-
trast to make the issues in society 
fully visible.

Folk the Police 
returns to Blind Pig

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Folk tributes to hip hop cer-

tainly had me intrigued, and even 
a tad anxious. Could this keep me 
entertained for four whole hours? 
The answer: YES. Folk the Police 
returned to The Blind Pig for its 
fifth year this past Sunday. Over 
four hours, 16 artists performed 
two songs each, all paying tribute 
to the great artists of hip hop. Cov-
ers included songs by Tupac, Emi-
nem, Missy Elliot and Jay-Z.

The night began with a few 

remarks by the event’s creator 
before he introduced the first band. 
The Way Down Wanders opened 
the show with a reimagined ver-
sion of Eminem’s “Cleanin’ Out 
My Closet.” They set the bar high 
with both talent and energy, and 
the remainder of the lineup kept 
the party going.

Iggy Shevak brought a gritty 

and growling cover of “Fancy,” 
and a crowd favorite, “The Fresh 
Prince of Bel-Air” theme song. Fol-
lowing was Mike Vial’s awesomely 
hilarious redo of “The Real Slim 
Shady.” The spirit of modern hip-
hop remained solid through Dave 
Menzo’s “99 Problems,” the better-
than-the-original “Ignition,” Keri 

Lynn Roche’s “Fuckin’ Problems” 
and her “Lose Yourself.” Between 
each set, D.J. Cataclysmic spun 
some solid tunes. Kanye, Beyoncé 
and a slew of danceable beats kept 
the crowd going during some of 
the lengthier set changes.

A young Olivia Millerschin stole 

the middle of the show with the 
minor “M” sharpied on both her 
hands and a white shirt blazed 
with “Bitches” across it. She 
brought the crowd in for “It Wasn’t 
Me” and took all the ’90s kids back 
to childhood with Ciara’s “Good-
ies.” She set the bar high once 
again, but The Accidentals came in 
and brought down the house with 
a shouting cover of A Tribe Called 
Quest’s “Can I Kick It?”

It seemed like eventually the 

bands couldn’t get any better, but 
Folk the Police continued to raise 
the energy into its third and fourth 
hours. FTP veterans Anna Lee’s 
Company and Nicole P’Simer 
came later in the evening. Anna 
Lee’s Company sang some old-
school hip hop with Naughty by 
Nature’s “O.P.P.” and a dirty south 
favorite, “It’s Hard out Here for a 
Pimp.” P’Simer brought some fun 
twists on Mystikal’s “Shake Ya 
Ass” and Missy Elliot’s “Work.” 
These two were clear crowd favor-

ites, and their experience showed 
tremendously throughout their 
sets (not to mention that P’Simer 
got a bra thrown at her).

As hip hop always does, the 

night took time to pay tribute to 
social issues. Abigail Stauffer led 
a short “Black Lives Matter” chant 
as a lead into Tupac’s “Keep Ya 
Head Up.” Stauffer and her band-
mates’ harmonization on “Since a 
man can’t make one / He has no 
right to tell a woman when and 
where to create one” was emotion-
al and powerful, to say the least. 
It was especially important to see 
these artists not only pay tribute 
to the music itself, but also the cul-
ture of hip hop.

Finally, Scissor Now re-ener-

gized the post-midnight crowd 
with a loud and rocking “Bust 
a Move,” before The Euphorics 
closed out Folk the Police with an 
awesome throwback to The Black 
Eyed Peas’ “Where is the Love.”

Some of the band members 

were in high school and some 
of the crowd were definitely 
longtime members of AARP. 
Folk 
the 
Police 
offers 
a 

welcoming 
environment 
for 

everyone to come and enjoy hip-
hop music through the lenses of 
local artists.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW

PARAMOUNT PICTURES

Martin wasn’t dreaming of an Oscar snub.
Oscar nominations 
snub Black artists

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

White. Male. Disappointing. 
When the nominations for the 

2015 Oscars were announced, 
an unimpressed public took to 
the blogosphere to debate the 
Academy’s lack of diversity in 
its selections. Each nominat-
ed actor in a lead or support-
ing category – 20 in all – is 
white. Every nominated direc-
tor and screenwriter is male. 
This homogenous and pasty 
crew has amounted to the least 
diverse group of nominees since 
1996, a painful reflection of the 
Academy’s 93 percent white and 
77 percent male electorate. The 
Academy’s decision to ignore 
some truly magnificent films 
feels less like a snub and more 
like a slap.

One of the most beautiful 

films of the summer, “Belle,” 
deserved much more recogni-
tion than it received. In a fan-
tastic use of ekphrasis, Gugu 
Mbatha-Raw 
(“Beyond 
the 

Lights”) brings to life a 1779 
painting of Dido Elizabeth 
Belle, a mixed-race woman 
raised in England by a blue-
blooded family. The film is 
witty and unafraid, taking on 
questions of race and gender 
that enthrall its audience.

Another 
fearless 
portray-

al of race relations this year, 
“Dear White People,” was also 
rebuffed at the Oscars. Set at a 
fictionalized Ivy League school, 
the film revolves around the 
simmering racial tensions of an 
overwhelmingly white campus 
that eventually boils over. Sam 

(Tessa 
Thompson, 
“Selma”), 

the host of a provocative radio 
show, 
and 
nerdy 
journalist 

Lionel (Tyler James Williams, 
“Everybody Hates Chris”) deal 
with the frustrations of being 
Black students at a school domi-
nated by the privileged and pre-
sumptuous.

But, the most shocking snub 

of 2015 was “Selma,” one of 
the most touching and cultur-
ally relevant films of the year. 
“Selma” retraces Martin Luther 
King Jr. in early 1965, when he 
and other Civil Rights activists 
joined forces to fight voter dis-
crimination in the South. The 
director, Ava DuVernay (“Mid-
dle of Nowhere”), would have 
been the first African-Amer-
ican woman to ever receive a 
best director Oscar nomina-
tion. DuVernay shows both the 
micro and macro of King’s life, 
including the tolls the move-
ment had on personal life and 
the hardships of the battle 
against systematic racism and 
injustice.

One of the arguments used 

against “Selma” is the glar-
ing historical inaccuracy in its 
portrayal of President Lyndon 

B. Johnson. The film falsely 
portrays LBJ as an antagonis-
tic obstruction in King’s fight 
for fairness when, in fact, the 
march at Selma was John-
son’s idea. In the true version 
of events, Johnson took action 
to make sure the protesters 
would be protected, and King 
and Johnson worked together 
to effect change. While the 
inaccuracies of the movie are 
frustrating, they dramatize the 
conundrums of a president in 
a divided country with many 
issues to confront. These flaws 
do not outweigh the movie’s 
hard and important work.

These films are a way for 

their Black directors, actors 
and producers to express their 
frustration about the oppres-
sion they have faced. The 
refusal of the Academy Awards 
to recognize the breath-taking 
work of African Americans 
in film shows a great divide 
between those who will lis-
ten to their stories and those 
who will not. As a Caucasian 
American woman, I write this 
article not as someone who 
can recognize the tragedies of 
“Selma” or the micro-aggres-
sions of “Dear White People” 
from my own life, but as an ally 
ready to learn. The Academy 
should not turn a blind eye to 
these works because they don’t 
identify with them, but take 
a genuine look at them to feel 
the compassion they evoke. 
They should promote them, 
give them the recognition they 
deserve and serve as an ally to 
the oppressed. Above all, they 
should shut up and listen.

The Academy’s 
decision feels less 
like a snub and 
more like a slap.

Detroit Arts Columnist

“If you ask me in a week, I 

may have a different five … but 
let’s say ‘The Dollmaker’ by Har-
riette Simpson Arnow, ‘Collect-
ed Poems’ by Robert Hayden, 
‘Them’ by Joyce Carol Oates 
… let me think …” Anna Clark 
paused for a long time, search-
ing for two more books to com-
plete her top five Detroit-centric 
reads. The list, she insisted, is 
just for now — likely to change 
imminently. She thought about 
her last two spots, taking a few 
minutes to mull it over. 

It took her a while, not because 

there aren’t many authors to 
choose from, but because there 
are too many. 

Much like Detroit’s art and 

music scenes, the city’s literary 
culture is immense. Detroit’s 
literary history for litbuffs is as 
rich as the legacy of Motown for 
the rest of the country. The city’s 
neighborhoods and buildings 
serve as backdrops for Pulit-
zer Prize-winning books, Poet 
Laureates were born and raised 
inside the city’s arms and major 
historical events that shaped the 
city’s history also shaped the 
story arcs of nationally recog-
nized literature. 

Unlike the art and music 

scene, however, the literary 
scene passes under most peo-
ple’s radar.

“I think part of it is with 

visual art and with music — 

those are things that a person 
can encounter without trying,” 
Clark said. “You turn on the 
radio and there’s Detroit music 
on. You drive down the road and 
you see a lot of Detroit art. It’s 
right there. And I think with lit-
erature, it’s very present, but it’s 
not always visible in the same 
way. The people that find it tend 
to be looking for it.” 

And those who are looking 

need not look much further than 
Literary Detroit, an organization 
that UM graduate Anna Clark 
founded with the goal of culti-
vating a literary scene in Detroit. 
Founded in 2012, Clark and other 
volunteers noticed that Detroit 
was being passed over by book 
tour authors, even if their works 
were set in Detroit and even if 
they themselves were from the 
city. Literary Detroit’s mission is 
to put Detroit on the country’s lit-
scene map. 

Literary 
Detroit 
organizes 

interactive literary events around 
the city that are free and open to 
the public, including readings by 
authors, book swaps and reading 
series. In February, they’ll kick 
off their Motor City Signal Series 
at Signal-Return, a letterpress 
company in Eastern Market. The 
series features themes like sex, 
identities, journeys and belong-
ing. The events feature perfor-
mances from writers, singers 
and painters, including Write-A-
House winner Casey Rocheteau, 
and hip-hop duo Passalacqua. 

Organizing events isn’t the 

only way that Clark helps to 
boost Detroit’s literary culture — 
in fact, she recently helped com-
pile and edit stories from literary 
greats in “A Detroit Anthology,” 
which was published last year. 

“It’s very diverse — the 

youngest contributor is 18 years 
old, the oldest contributor is in 
her 90s — because the city has 
changed so much within liv-
ing memory, a lot of the stories 
people tell capture different 
moments in time,” Clark said. “ 
‘The Anthology’ is as diverse as 
the city is.” 

“The Anthology” steps away 

from the usual explanations that 
surround the city in mainstream 
press and instead explores the 
conversational aspects of what 
Clark calls everyday “lived expe-
riences.” Some of the authors 
featured in the book include 
Grace Lee Boggs, Desiree Coo-
per, Dream Hampton and Shaka 
Senghor. 

Despite this recent publica-

tion, however, Clark believes 
there are a plethora of stories 
yet to be told about present-day 
Detroit. 

“A lot of Detroit fiction that 

is out there is midcentury, and 
there’s not a lot that has come 
out of the last 15 years,” Clark 
said. “There’s more to be said. 
The city is such a powerful home 
for stories.”

Detroit’s immense, 
underpublicized 
literature scene

Timeless alt. country 
on ‘Natalie Prass’

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

Genres are a necessary evil. 

While they help to clearly define 
musical boundaries for better 
organization 
of 
musical 

preference, 
more 
often 

than not, they 
hinder 
true 

exploration.

When 

thinking 
of 

something like 
alternative 
country, listeners will likely be 
more preoccupied with the “coun-
try” instead of with the “alterna-
tive,” largely due to the fact that 
country music is so easily recog-
nizable and widespread. But with 
up-and-coming alternative coun-
try artists such as Natalie Prass, 
such a simple label falls short.

Her debut album, Natalie Prass, 

is short but sweet, pulling from 
some of the best aspects of old-
school country music – the slight 
vocal twang and a no-nonsense 
lyrical style. She draws this from an 
arsenal of soulful, swinging melo-
dies from another era.

The album starts off with “My 

Baby Don’t Understand Me,” a 
slow, smoldering ballad of love 
gone wrong. The track builds 
up to a musical break fit for the 
theater, using what sounds like a 
full orchestra to starkly contrast 
Prass’s small, soft voice. The track 
rolls along with a steady, jazzy beat 
– a component not uncommon 
throughout the album.

As the album progresses, more 

and more of Prass’s country roots 
come into play. “Your Fool” most 
clearly showcases the subtle twang 
of her voice, especially when 
paired with a guitar driven doo-
wop melody. The track sounds like 
a classic, with nothing in particu-
lar that places it in the present day.

Prass continues her album 

by pulling deeper from the past. 
“Christy” sounds straight out of a 
black-and-white movie. The mel-
ody is dynamic and theatrical – 
seeming to follow that of a waltz or 

a tango, working perfectly to dra-
matize the love triangle painted by 
the lyrics. It could be listened to in 
a grand ballroom or a quaint bed-
room, making Prass’s versatility as 
an artist quite clear.

Though the album consis-

tently deals with similar themes 
of heartbreak, the lyrics avoid the 
melodramatic, allowing the music 
to speak for itself. Prass, even in 
her youth as an artist, realizes the 
power of the understated vocal. 
While Prass never fully raises 
her voice, her minimalist style of 
vocals is most powerful in “Never 
Over You” and “Bird of Prey.”

Generally following patterns of 

low-key vocals and lively instru-
mentation, the album breaks away 
with “Reprise.” While the instru-
mentals remain dynamic with 
moving sounds of flute, percussion 
and sparse clapping, the vocals are 
mostly spoken instead of sung. The 
almost overly sincere spoken ele-
ment, in combination with the less 
than cohesive instrumentation, 
make for a confusing and slightly 
cheesy feel. The dramatic attempt 
of Prass is clear, but ultimately, her 
efforts fall a bit flat on this track.

Wrapping up with “It Is 

You,” Prass returns to her full 
instrumentation, again using an 
orchestra-esque 
arrangement 

to create a truly magical sound. 
Even the lyrics seem to be more 
lighthearted than the rest of the 
album, wistfully singing of things 
such as “birds with porcelain 
wings,” or a “house filled with 
books.” Placing “It Is You” after 
“Reprise” creates a bold contrast 
of sound, allowing Prass to 
demonstrate her flexibility.

Natalie 
Prass 
takes 
the 

foundations of classic country 
and builds on them. Prass’s 
twists 
on 
more 
heavily 

layered, yet classical musical 
arrangements. Jazz-fueled beats 
and understated vocals launch 
her out of the alternative country 
label and into something of much 
greater depth. The album is both 
subtly nuanced and obviously 
designed to encapsulate the 
sound of heartache in a mature 
and honest manner.

New ‘Americans’ 
sets the bar high

The FX drama is 
now one of the best 

shows on TV

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

The leap that “The Ameri-

cans” took in its second season 
was nothing short of extraor-
dinary. While 
it had a decent 
first 
season, 

the show ele-
vated itself to 
become 
one 

of 
the 
best 

dramas 
on 

television 
— 

benefiting 
a 

story that was 
densely plotted 
and sequences 
which 
had 

gut-wrenching 
levels of tension. Because of 
that leap, the series’ third sea-
son has a lot to prove, namely 
showing that last year wasn’t a 
fluke. After seeing the first four 
episodes of the new season, it’s 
clear that last year wasn’t a blip 
in the radar.

“The 
Americans” 
follows 

Philip (Matthew Rhys, “Broth-
ers and Sisters”) and Elizabeth 
Jennings (Keri Russell, “Felic-
ity”), KGB agents posing as a 
normal American family during 
the Cold War. This season picks 
off where last year left off, with 
Philip and Elizabeth weighing 
whether to enter their daughter 
Paige (newcomer Holly Taylor) 
into a KGB program for second-
generation agents. They’re also 
running operations to try to 
gather intelligence on the CIA’s 
team in Afghanistan.

The best aspect of the show is 

how it deftly develops its central 
relationship, the arranged mar-
riage and partnership between 
Philip 
and 
Elizabeth. 
Even 

though it’s clear that the two 
characters love one another, 
their marriage is fraught with 

friction. The two have differ-
ent opinions about whether to 
tell Paige about who they really 
are, which strains their rela-
tionship. However, despite the 
arguments, the characters dem-
onstrate that, deep down, they 
truly want to help one another. 
There’s a scene in the third epi-
sode where Philip helps Eliza-
beth through a medical problem. 
The two have no dialogue, but 
are able to communicate a wide 
range of emotions. It’s a painful 
scene because of their acting.

The show works as well as it 

does because of the way it’s able 
to build tension, mostly in the 
scenes that feature Philip and 
Elizabeth’s spying. These epi-
sodes are peppered with scenes 
that feature the two of them try-
ing to complete certain objec-
tives. With many of them, the 
series chooses a slow build, cre-
ating a fantastic amount of sus-
pense. Whether they’re trying 
to evade capture or perform hor-
rible acts of violence in the name 
of their country, the scenes play 
out in a slow, but fascinating 
manner.

Aside from the two leads, Tay-

lor’s character shines, refusing 
to let Paige fall into the typical 
“annoying teenager” role. The 

show has done well by her, allow-
ing her to grow by giving her an arc 
where she becomes more involved 
in the church. There’s also the 
ticking time bomb — the secret of 
who her parents really are — wait-
ing to go off. When it does, Paige 
will dovetail into the main story-
line, which can only make it better.

“The 
Americans” 
’s 
cast 

is among the finest out there 
because of its depth and quality 
supporting acting. Noah Emm-
erich is brilliant as the couple’s 
FBI agent neighbor. The show has 
given him an engrossing story to 
play with his marital struggles. In 
addition, Frank Langella (“Frost/
Nixon”) is a welcome addition 
as the couple’s new handler. He 
doesn’t appear a lot in the epi-
sodes, but he makes an impres-
sion when he does.

It’s amazing how all of the 

many pieces that make up “The 
Americans” coalesce into a show 
that’s this special. Each of its 
parts, from the marriage at its 
center to the lowest supporting 
character, adds something to its 
atmosphere or thematic reso-
nance. There’s nothing else on 
television like “The Americans” 
and, with this stretch of episodes, 
it cements itself as one of the best 
shows on TV right now.

For Kopas, Michigan
swimming a family affair

With her success, 

the swimmer 

follows her father’s 

footsteps

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

Emily Kopas didn’t just don 

the maize and blue at her first 
competition as a Wolverine. 
Rather, she grew up repping the 
block ‘M’, thanks to her father.

William Kopas was the 1986 

Big Ten champion in the 1,650-
yard freestyle for Michigan.

It didn’t hurt that her uncle, 

Brice Kopas, was a Wolverine 
swimmer too, garnering All-
American status in 1994.

So naturally, when signing 

day arrived for Kopas, the 
18-year-old talent followed the 
branches of her family tree to 
Canham Natatorium. But she 
didn’t do it for reasons you 
would expect.

“I 
have 
always 
been 
a 

Michigan kid,” Kopas said. 
“Because my dad swam here 
and so did my uncle. Since birth, 
I’ve been in maize and blue. But 
they didn’t really have much of 
an impact in my decision.”

Though the shining lights 

of Canham Natatorium were 
certainly 
enticing, 
what 

brought Kopas to Ann Arbor 
was the challenge of Michigan 
academics.

The last name Kopas comes 

with 
lofty 
expectations 
at 

Michigan. 
But 
rather 
than 

get bogged down, the young 
Wolverine 
explained 
that 

coming from a competitive 
family inspired her to challenge 
her 
father’s 
and 
uncle’s 

success. 
Despite 
swimming 

long-distance 
events, 
Kopas 

competed, determined to etch 
her own legacy in a chapter 
of 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 

swimming program.

And Michigan coach Mike 

Bottom should thank William 

Kopas 
for 
instilling 
that 

competitive spirit, because his 
daughter’s inherited attitude is 
yielding success.

On 
Dec. 
4, 
Kopas 
was 

part of the 400-yard medley 
relay team that broke the 
previous 
Michigan 
record, 

touching the wall in 3:33.91 
at the AT&T Winter National 
Championships in Greensboro, 
North Carolina. As if one record 
wasn’t enough, the freshman 
flew 
through 
the 
200-yard 

breaststroke in 2:09.70 two 
days later, breaking a Michigan 
record that had stood since 
1995.

Kopas explained the thrill of 

breaking the 
record, 
but 

emphasized 
that 
she 

swam 
first 

for 
her 

teammates 
and 
Michigan, 
the accolades 
firmly 
second. 

She 

stressed that the record was by 
no means an end goal, but rather, 
a small step toward improving 
her times to claim both the 
other breaststroke record and a 
title for the Wolverines.

But Kopas was not ready to 

accept 
her 
record-breaking 

performance as the highlight 
of her season. Her competitive 
upbringing 
has 
taught 
her 

better.

On Jan. 6, Kopas was named 

Big Ten Freshman of the Week 
after she won the 50-meter 
breaststroke in 32.91 and the 
100-meter 
breaststroke 
in 

1:11.15 at the Orange Bowl 
Classic in Key Largo, Florida. 
The freshman also swam on 
the winning 200-meter medley 
relay with junior Ali DeLoof, 
who captured the title of Big 
Ten Swimmer of the Week on 
Jan. 6 as well.

“I’m really honored, because 

Ali is an amazing swimmer,” 
Kopas said. “I think it’s really 
exciting for the whole entire 
team to be up and coming, and 
major competitors at Big Tens. 
How many people have gotten 
Big Ten Swimmer of the Week 
is really exciting.”

But Kopas didn’t stop there 

either.

She 
followed 
up 
the 

performance 
on 
Jan. 
10, 

contributing to the 200-yard 
medley 
relay 
that 
placed 

first against Notre Dame and 
Northwestern. 
Though 
she 

didn’t win her individual races, 
she came in second behind 
Notre 
Dame 
All-American 

Emma Reaney 
in 
both 
the 

200- 
and 

100-yard 
breaststroke, 
a shortcoming 
not 
to 
be 

ashamed of.

“It was really 

exciting being 
able to compete 
with 
her,” 

Kopas said. “It 

was just exciting for all of us 
and gave hope to everybody. 
Everybody could see, especially 
the freshmen, that we aren’t 
these little underdogs. We can 
actually go up against these big 
dogs.”

Kopas saved her finest meet 

for Saturday — against the 
Buckeyes no less — though she 
entered the race as an underdog 
once again.

Claiming 
first 
place 
in 

both 
the 
100- 
and 
200-

yard breaststroke, and also 
contributing to the first-place 
200-meter medley relay team, 
she left the pool looking like a 
leader of Michigan’s up-and-
coming swim program.

For Kopas, it was business as 

usual. The saying is, “like father, 
like son.”

But for Kopas, it’s a bit 

different. It’s like father, like 
daughter.

“We can

big dogs.”

Positive thinking fuels Bottom

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

Frequently, 
athletics 
and 

philosophy don’t overlap. Yet 
Michigan men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving coach 
Mike 
Bottom 
has 
defined 

this 
juncture 
in 
a 
sport 

where 
athletes 
are 
under 

immense pressure to execute, 
and winners and losers are 
determined by hundredths of a 
second.

Professor Kim Cameron of 

the Ross School of Business 
is a co-founder of the Center 
for 
Positive 
Organizational 

Scholarship 
at 
Michigan 

and a proponent of positive 
visualization as an important 
tool for a team’s success.

When teaching others his 

beliefs, Cameron encourages 
others 
to 
imagine 
three 

competitors 
standing 
arm’s 

length away from each other. 
The first is an underperforming 
athlete, the second is average 
and healthy and the third is an 
accomplished Olympian.

In order for the first athlete 

to become as good as the 
second, constructive criticism 
and negative feedback are used.

And in order to make the 

second athlete the Olympian, 
both 
Bottom 
and 
Cameron 

believe in positive affirmations 
of an athlete’s ability.

Adapting this approach has 

given Bottom an opportunity 
for a more holistic approach to 
coaching.

“We’re trying to grasp the 

best of the human condition, 
the 
highest 
aspirations 
an 

athlete has for themselves,” 
Cameron 
said. 
“There’s 

nothing brand-new or novel 
about this except for the most 
part we ignore it, because it 
takes cognitive effort to switch 
to a positive bias.”

Over Thanksgiving weekend, 

Bottom, a longtime believer 
in positive attitude, invited 
Cameron to lecture his athletes 
about the correlation between 
affirmative thinking and an 
athlete’s performance.

Cameron 
spoke 
to 
the 

athletes about the benefits of 
having 
gratuitous 
thoughts, 

which allows a person’s physical 
well-being to strengthen with a 
more affirmative mindset. To 
get to that point, he suggested 
keeping a gratitude journal.

“Numerous swimmers keep 

gratitude 
journals,” 
Bottom 

said. “But we don’t enforce it, 
they do it because they want to.”

And Bottom’s unorthodox 

methods are paying of.

Now in his sixth season 

with Michigan — his second 
as head coach of both the men 
and women’s teams — Bottom 
has led both teams to a nearly 
perfect dual-meet record (49-
3-1), coached in the past five 
Olympics, and was named Big 
Ten Swimming Coach of the 
Year four times.

“The word humility is often 

equated 
with 
meekness 
or 

weakness,” Cameron said. “The 
real definition of humility is 
opening to learning, openness 
to feedback from others in order 
to approve. So humility and 
improvement are very closely 
aligned. Mike is a very humble 
guy in that sense.”

This 
characteristic 
hasn’t 

gone 
unnoticed 
by 
his 

swimmers, either.

To senior and co-captain of 

the men’s team, Richard Funk, 
Bottom was a large part why he 
committed to Michigan.

“Bottom is a great leader 

and a visionary, not just in the 
pool but in academics and in 
the community. He surrounded 
himself with a great staff,” Funk 
said. “(He taught me that) in 
order to be a leader you need to 
know first how to be a follower. 
You need to understand where 
the team is and how to approach 
a situation.”

Added 
freshman 
Tristan 

Sanders: “While (the coaches) 
are teaching you how to swim, 
they’re teaching you about life, 
about how to be a leader. We’re 
protective of each other and of 
Michigan.”

Forgiveness, 
compassion 

and 
thankfulness 
are 
the 

three pillars of what Bottom 
considers the values it takes to 

be a Wolverine, a role that also 
comes with the responsibility of 
protecting this code of conduct.

Swimming is one of the 

most mentally draining sports, 
and 
many 
swimmers 
say 

they are unmotivated by the 
grueling practice schedule that 
accompanies the sport. Yet the 
positive team atmosphere is a 
reason his team continues to 
fight through early morning 
practices.

“He reminds us on a daily 

basis to think positive,” said 
junior Marni Oldershaw.

Cameron 
cited 
research 

that shows that for an athlete 
to 
flourish, 
three 
to 
five 

compliments should be given 
for every negative criticism of 
their performance.The coach is 
the single most important figure 
to make sure this happens.

Bottom 
believes 
a 
coach 

should not only help their 
athletes achieve greatness now, 
but also lay the foundation 
for it in their future. He 
understands 
that 
every 

single one of his swimmers 
has a life outside of Canham 
Natatorium, encouraging them 
to push through their personal 
problems.

“For me, my passion to win has 

nothing to do with my ego. It has 
to do everything with wanting 
the athletes to internalize the 
things we’re teaching them 
here,” Bottom said. “Excellence 
is an important part of not just 
winning, but excellence is an 
important part of life.”

Cameron and Bottom both 

recognize 
the 
extraordinary 

outcomes 
that 
might 
come 

with this focus on positive 
affirmation. 
Already 
under 

Bottom’s 
tutelage, 
the 

Wolverines have shown great 
success, especially since the 
integration of the men’s and 
women’s teams.

Positive visualization could 

be an opportunity to extract 
excellence 
not 
only 
from 

Bottom’s swimmers, but also 
from all athletes across campus.

“It’s 
an 
opportunity 
for 

Michigan to be Michigan,” 
Bottom said.

Michigan’s intergalactic fan

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

You won’t find him fighting 

the Rebel Alliance on Luke 
Skywalker’s home planet of 
Tatooine, but you might find 
him cheering in the stands at a 
Michigan hockey game. Don’t 
expect to see his face, though.

Around 
2011, 
Michigan 

superfan Jon Leopold began 
showing his support for the 
Wolverines by dressing up as 
a Stormtrooper from the Star 
Wars 
movies, 
decorated 
in 

maize and blue.

The unique sight garnered 

attention 
from 
spectators, 

athletes and the media alike. 
When Leopold first dressed 
as the “Wolverine Trooper” at 
a Michigan football game, he 
received 
numerous 
requests 

to take pictures with fans — so 
many that the football players 
had showered and met with 
their families before Leopold 
even left the Big House.

Though he is not a Michigan 

alumnus or an Ann Arbor 
native, 
Leopold 
had 
been 

coming to Michigan athletic 
events years before he unveiled 
the Stormtrooper outfit.

He makes the drive from 

Goodrich — just outside of Flint 
— multiple times a month, and 
sometimes multiple times a 
week to see games. But driving 
two and a half hours round 
trip has never put a halt to his 
dedication.

One of Leopold’s favorite 

memories from his time as 
the Wolverine Trooper came 
when the men’s basketball team 
earned a spot in the 2013 Final 
Four in Atlanta, Georgia.

“I was at the pep rally at the 

team’s hotel,” Leopold said. “At 
the end of it, Tim Hardaway Jr. 
pointed me out in the crowd, so 
Coach Beilein called me up to 
the stage to lead the crowd in 

singing ‘The Victors’ to finish 
the rally.”

Though 
Leopold 
gained 

attention 
for 
attendance 

at 
numerous 
football 
and 

basketball games, he’s also a 
regular fan at water polo, golf 
and cross country events. If 
Michigan has a team for it, he 
has been to games to cheer them 
on.

Leopold has gained more 

popularity in the Michigan 
community 
than 
he 
ever 

expected. Over the past few 
years, 
he 
has 
accumulated 

nearly 10,000 followers on social 
media, received attention from 
USA Today and even handed out 
over 1,500 Wolverine Trooper 
trading cards.

To 
accompany 
the 

stormtrooper outfit, Leopold 
also dons a maize and blue 
Canadian 
flag. 
While 
not 

a 
Canadian 
himself, 
his 

grandmother is from Sarnia, a 
city just across the international 
border 
from 
the 
state 
of 

Michigan.

The flag itself is covered with 

signatures 
from 
prominent 

Canadians around Michigan 
athletics, 
most 
notably 

Michigan hockey coach Red 
Berenson and former basketball 
player Nik Stauskas. At the 
swim meet against Ohio State 
this past weekend, he held the 
flag high every time Edmonton 
native and senior swimmer 
Richard Funk entered the pool.

While the Wolverine Trooper 

is one of the most consistent 
and 
dedicated 
supporters, 

his presence in the Michigan 
community stretches far beyond 
his love for sports.

“I’m 
part 
of 
the 
501st 

Legion, a worldwide Star Wars 
costuming group that does 
all kinds of charity events,” 
Leopold said. “Annually, the 
501st Legion raises about 25 
million dollars for charity. I 
go with them and visit kids at 
C.S. Mott Children’s hospital 
dressed up as the Wolverine 

Trooper.”

A member of the Great Lakes 

Garrison, the Michigan chapter 
of the 501st Legion, Leopold has 
worn the costume for photos 
at fundraising events such as 
the 
Wolverine 
vs. 
Buckeye 

Challenge For Life, an annual 
event in which both schools 
raise funds for organ donations.

“Occasionally 
people 
will 

give me a few dollars for 
taking a photo,” Leopold said. 
“All of that always goes to the 
Children’s Hospital. I never 
ask for money, but some people 
insist that I take it, so with it I 
make a donation.”

From fan donations, he once 

raised over $600 for a girl 
who was fighting lymphoma. 
Leopold earns great praise from 
the community for his support, 
and all he asks for in return is a 
smile on a few young faces.

Though most Stormtroopers 

hail from the dark side, this 
one has proven to be the

Substitutes help
‘M’ stay steady

By BEN FIDELMAN

Daily Sports Writer

Competing in one of the most 

physically taxing college sports, 
the Michigan wrestling team’s 
depth is tested often. Midway 
through the 2014-15 season, the 
16th-ranked Wolverines (3-2 Big 
Ten, 5-3 overall) are seeing major 
contributions from wrestlers who 
weren’t in the starting lineup at 
the beginning of the year, but are 
continuing to succeed using the 
“next man up” mentality.

Highlighting that group are 

redshirt freshman George Fisher 
and fifth-year senior Zebulon 
Hilyard.

At 
the 
141-pound 
weight 

class, Fisher has stepped in for 
fifth-year senior Steve Dutton, 
who ended his career after the 
Eastern Michigan Duals due to 
multiple concussions. Coming off 
of an All-American performance 
in 2014, Dutton was projected to 
be a staple of the Michigan lineup 
this season. So when Fisher filled 
the vacancy, a probable win 
turned into a definite question 
mark.

Though he hasn’t yet replaced 

Dutton’s All-American results, 
Fisher has done surprisingly well 
sliding into the starting lineup. 
During the Southern Scuffle 
— a tournament that many 
team members competed in on 
Jan. 1 and 2 — he pinned three 
wrestlers and finished with a 6-2 
record, good for seventh place. In 
dual season, Fisher has held his 
own, posting a 3-3 record (20-11 
overall).

“(Next man up) has been a big 

part of our lineup this year,” said 
Michigan coach Joe McFarland. 
“We really haven’t been healthy. 
George (Fisher) has done a 
tremendous job. Earlier this 

year he was wrestling at (the 
133-pound weight class) and we 
moved him up to 141, and (he) is 
really just doing a great job. He’s 
getting great experience, too.”

In what’s believed to be more 

of a temporary situation, Hilyard 
has been filling in for injured 
junior Rossi Bruno at the 133-
pound weight class. Even though 
this is Hilyard’s fifth season 
in the program, the last three 
matchups have been his first dual 
meet experiences in his college 
career. The first two of those 
starts were tough for Wolverine 
fans to swallow, as Hilyard was 
defeated by his opponents from 
Ohio State and Wisconsin.

Last Sunday against Indiana, 

he pulled through with his first 
career dual meet win. At the time, 
Hilyard’s 3-0 decision pushed the 
Michigan lead to 9-0.

“Bruno 
goes 
down, 
and 

Zeb (Hilyard) steps in there,” 
McFarland said. “These guys 
have to be ready when those 
opportunities arise, and I think 
for the most part they have done 
a great job of that.”

Bruno is expected back in the 

lineup next weekend for the dual 
against Penn State.

With the Big Ten standing 

alone as the best conference in 
college wrestling, placing four 
teams in the top 10 and 11 teams 
in the top 25, showing depth like 
the Wolverines have this year has 
been key when dealing with such 
a grueling schedule.

Michigan 
heads 
into 
the 

final three weeks of conference 
play needing to finish strong to 
compensate for a pair of losses to 
rivals No. 2 Minnesota and No. 4 
Ohio State.

There might be more bumps 

along the way, but as always, 
someone will step up.

A look at the top games in the Michigan-MSU rivalry

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

For the next two weeks, the 

Michigan hockey team is at war.

The 13th-ranked Wolverines 

will take on archrival Michigan 
State twice during that time 
frame, the first of which is 
this Friday at Joe Louis Arena 
in Detroit. Michigan (7-1 Big 
Ten, 15-7 overall) will be the 
favorites, but history suggests 
the Spartans (3-3-2, 9-11-2) are 
capable of wreaking havoc on 
the red-hot Wolverines.

With 12 NCAA championships 

and 35 Frozen Four appearances 
between the two programs, 
the rivalry is among the best in 
college hockey.

Though 
not 
nearly 
as 

lopsided 
as 
the 
Michigan 

Daily-State 
News 
rivalry 

(the Daily is currently riding 
a 10-game winning streak), 
Michigan still holds a 152-128-

19 record against its neighbor 
to the north, including a 2-1 
win over the Spartans Dec. 29 
in the Great Lakes Invitational 
championship. 
The 
Daily 

breaks down some of the most 
notable games of the teams’ 300 
matchups.

Jan. 24, 1925

Three seasons after each team 

founded a hockey program, the 
rivalry was born in East Lansing. 
With just a smattering of fans in 
attendance, the Wolverines won 
6-3, sparking a 36-1 run over 
Michigan State that stretched 
to 1958.

March 9, 1950

Still the most lopsided game 

in the rivalry’s history, Paul 
Pelow and Bob Heathcott each 
tallied hat tricks, as Michigan 
cruised to a 17-1 win.

“With 
the 
Spartans 

completely disorganized during 
the entire contest, Heyliger’s 
crew 
romped 
at 
will 
over 

Coach Paulsen’s hapless and 
inexperienced club,” wrote the 
Daily.

The win for Michigan came 

just before a stretch of five 
national championships in six 
seasons, a feat that has yet to be 
matched.

March 3, 1966

The 
in-state 
rivals 
have 

faced 
off 
for 
numerous 

championships, 
the 
first 
of 

which was for the Western 
College 
Hockey 
Association 

title. Having dropped six of 
eight games leading up to the 
event, the Wolverines — two 
years removed from a national 
title in 1964 — looked poised to 
upend the No. 1 Spartans.

But Michigan State battled 

back for a win and never looked 
back en route to the program’s 
first national title. The win 
began a run for the Spartans, 
as Michigan won just 28 of the 
next 84 in the series.

Nov. 8, 1985

After nearly two decades 

of dormancy, the Wolverines 
finally fought back under coach 
Red Berenson. The 5-4 win was 
Michigan’s first in seven tries 
against Michigan State, and just 
the second such win since 1981.

“We wanted it more than in 

the past,” Berenson told the 
Daily after the win. “I don’t 
think we were as much hoping 
to win as we were expecting to 
win.

“I don’t think there is going to 

be anything better, until we win 
the league title, than beating 
Michigan State.”

The game also included a fight 

between Michigan goaltender 
Tim 
Makris 
and 
Spartan 

foward Mitch Messier. More 
importantly, the win helped lay 
the groundwork for Berenson’s 
tenure, which has continued for 
31 years and counting.

March 1, 1996

The rivalry is very much 

defined by the success of both 
teams in the 1990s. After being 
swept by Lake Superior State 
the weekend before, No. 5 
Michigan needed a win over 
No. 3 Michigan State to stay in 
contention for its first national 
title in over three decades.

“There’s a major sense of 

urgency; a desperation we feel. 
We have to win these games,” 
forward John Arnold told the 
Daily before the game. “Once we 
start jumping to conclusions or 
looking ahead, we’re not going 
to get anywhere.”

The Wolverines didn’t look 

ahead, as they stomped the 
Spartans, 3-0. The win sparked 
a nine-game winning streak, as 
Michigan won its first of two 
national titles with Berenson at 
the helm.

Oct. 6, 2001

Arguably the peak of the 

rivalry, both teams met in the 
first modern hockey game to be 
played outdoors, occurring at 
East Lansing’s Spartan Stadium. 
With 74,544 fans in attendance 
and 
millions 
following 
the 

action on television, both teams 
faced off coming off of Frozen 
Four appearances earlier in the 
year and ranking in the top five 
nationally. The spectacle was 
college hockey at its finest.

Then-No. 4 Michigan nearly 

upset the defending national 
champion 
and 
top-ranked 

Spartans, but let up a rebound 
goal with 47 seconds remaining 
as both teams played to a 3-3 
tie. The spectacle, which kicked 
off the 2001-02 season for all 
of college hockey, included 12 
players that went on to NHL 
careers.

Dec. 11, 2010

Not 
to 
be 
outdone, 
the 

Wolverines hosted an outdoor 
game of their own nine years 
later. Though neither team was 
ranked in the top five, 104,173 
fans braved the elements to 
watch 
Michigan 
defeat 
the 

Spartans, 5-0, in what was then 
a record for the most-watched 
hockey game.

“It was exactly as advertised,” 

Berenson told the Daily after the 
game. “It was the real deal. For 
me, it couldn’t be any better.”

The 
third 
battle 
of 
the 

elements 
between 
the 
two 

programs comes in less than 
two weeks, when both teams 
travel 
to 
Chicago’s 
Soldier 

Field for the Coyote Logistics 
Hockey City Classic on Feb. 7. 
If history tells us anything, it 
should be an intense, exciting 
and potential turning point for 
either team.

ICE HOCKEY

Rebounding keys win

By MAX BULTMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

When it was announced that 

junior guard Caris LeVert would 
miss the rest of the season with 
a foot injury, the Michigan 
men’s basketball lost its leader 
in practically every statistical 
category — points, rebounds, 
assists, steals and minutes.

And an hour before tipoff 

of 
Tuesday’s 
game 
between 

the Wolverines and Nebraska, 
the loss in production was 
compounded 
as 
sophomore 

guard Derrick Walton Jr. came 
onto the court in street clothes, 
missing the game with an injured 
foot. Without LeVert and Walton, 
Michigan wasn’t just missing its 
starting backcourt, but also its 
two top rebounders.

And 
yet, 
in 
their 
58-44 

win Tuesday, the Wolverines 
were able to outrebound the 
Cornhuskers thanks to breakout 
efforts from sophomore forward 
Zak Irvin and senior forward 
Max Bielfeldt. Buoyed by 12 
boards from Irvin and nine from 
Bielfeldt, Michigan pulled down 
34 total rebounds, eight more 
than Nebraska did.

“(Walton and LeVert) are the 

two best guard rebounders we 
have, in the Big Ten and on the 
team,” Irvin said. “So we knew 
that was a big point of emphasis — 
for people to step up and rebound 
the basketball.”

Granted, if Nebraska hadn’t 

shot an atrocious 30.6 percent 
from the floor, there wouldn’t 
have been so many rebounds up 
for grabs. But in a game without 
their two top rebounders, the 
striking margin speaks to the 
effort the Michigan frontcourt 
put in on the glass.

Irvin and Bielfeldt both had 

career highs in boards Tuesday, 
with four of Bielfeldt’s rebounds 
coming on the offensive end, 
allowing 
the 
Wolverines 
to 

generate extra possessions and 
stretch their lead.

With 
2:23 
to 
play 
and 

Michigan up by a comfortable 
15-point margin, Bielfeldt chased 
down a loose ball off an Irvin 
miss. And though the play didn’t 
alter the outcome of the game, it 
was a microcosm of the display 
the 
senior 
forward 
showed 

throughout the second half.

“Even when we were down 

12 or 11, (Bielfeldt) would give 
them an extra possession or just 
out-hustle us to a rebound,” said 
Nebraska coach Tim Miles. “That 
was tough. I just thought he out-
scrapped us that way.”

Irvin had five of his rebounds 

in the game’s first nine minutes 
and was repeatedly able to 
capitalize on stellar box-outs 
from Bielfeldt to find the space to 
clear the glass.

Perhaps his only rebounding 

mistake 
came 
with 
4:15 

remaining, when Irvin pulled 
down a defensive rebound but 
lost control once he hit the 
ground, fumbling the ball out 
of bounds, forfeiting possession 

back to the Cornhuskers.

Still, Irvin playing as well as 

he did, especially down low, is a 
welcome sight for the Wolverines, 
who travel to East Lansing 
on Sunday for what had been 
shaping up as an unfavorable 
matchup for Michigan. His 12 
rebounds Tuesday also marked 
the 
first 
double-double 
a 

Wolverine has had all season, a 
positive indicator from a player 
who has been trying to round out 
his game.

“One of the things I was really 

working with (Irvin) on this 
summer, and going forward, was 
rebounding and assists,” Beilein 
said. “Twelve rebounds and three 
assists is a huge step forward in 
his growth.”

Added 
Irvin: 
“It’s 
just 

competing. You’ve gotta want the 
basketball.”

It’s a good thing for Michigan 

that Irvin and Bielfeldt both 
wanted the basketball. Without 
LeVert and Walton, there wasn’t 
really another choice.

Shannon Smith reappears

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

For 
Shannon 
Smith, 
the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
season has been plagued by 
inconsistency. And Monday was 
much of the same.

In the first half, the senior 

guard’s transition game was off-
tempo, and she overthrew the 
ball past senior forward Cyesha 
Goree in the paint, rather than 
slowing down to make a play 
of her own. Four minutes into 
the game, she was called for a 
travel and was 
benched right 
after. 
And 

to top it all 
off, she was 
scoreless 
at 

halftime.

The 
last 

time 
Smith 

had recorded 
such a poor 
performance 
was 48 days ago.

Dec. 9 against Princeton, 

she couldn’t connect with the 
basket in transition and scored 
just two points in Michigan’s 
first home loss of the season — 
coincidentally its largest margin 
of defeat of the season (30).

It was a demoralizing and 

poorly-timed loss, with Notre 
Dame — then the No. 5 team 
in the country — next on the 
schedule. The Wolverines (5-3 
Big Ten, 13-6 overall) needed 
to return to playing their best 
basketball.

Four days later in South Bend, 

the comeback Smith was hoping 
for didn’t materialize.

In the first half, Michigan 

trailed the Fighting Irish by 
single digits, barely staying in 
close contention. But Smith hit 
the ground hard, unable to get 
back up while clutching her knee 
as her teammates stared wide-
eyed from the sideline.

She returned in the second 

half, but her nine total points 
weren’t enough to pull off the 
upset.

From there on, though, it 

appeared a fire had sparked 
within the 5-foot-7 senior as she 
regained her focus.

With the exception of a win 

over Eastern Michigan, Smith 
scored double digits in every 
game 
thereafter, 
earning 
a 

career high in points (36) and 
free throws (11) against Ohio 
State.

But last Thursday against No. 

20 Iowa, Smith scored two points 

like she had 44 
days 
before. 

She 
turned 

the ball over 
on two crucial 
possessions 
in 
the 
final 

minutes 
against 
the 

Hawkeyes and 
was rushing in 
transition.

It was arguably her worst 

performance of the season. But 
as she has done all year, Smith 
attempted to work past it.

“The 
biggest 
thing 
for 

Shannon,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico, “(and) this 
happened in Iowa and we talk 
about it with her all the time, is 
that you can make a couple bad 
plays, have a bad 10 minutes, 
a bad half or a bad 39 minutes, 
and maybe make one play to help 
your team win the game.

“But if you let all that stuff 

bother you mentally, you’re not 
in a good place to make that 
play.”

Even though it might be a 

challenge for Smith to bounce 
back, she managed to in the 
second half against Illinois, 
which was a stark contrast to the 
first.

It was the older and more 

polished Smith who showed up. 
She scored less than five minutes 
into the frame, adding two 

points and a free throw over a 
minute later.

Smith played a smart and 

more controlled game, totaling 
13 points. She was back on her 
game, and she knew it: After 
her first basket, she smiled, 
looked downcourt toward her 
teammates and held one finger 
up.

“It’s really important for us 

that she sets the tone, because 
she’s so great in the open court,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Sometimes 
she does have to slow down, 
because that’s where she makes 
some mistakes. But that’s what 
she brings to us that we need, 
and we really don’t have a lot of 
players like her.”

As the team’s leader in assists 

at 88, Smith totaled four against 
the Illini: three to Goree for a 
layup and one to sophomore 
guard Siera Thompson for a 
2-point jumper. The selflessness 
was contagious as the Wolverines 
recorded 20-plus assists for the 
sixth time this year.

“Our kids are so unselfish of 

sharing the basketball,” Barnes 
Arico said. “It starts with 
Shannon Smith. She just loves to 
make the extra pass and really 
get everyone involved.”

Smith still had six turnovers 

and needs to continue to work 
on her game with a tough 
conference 
schedule 
ahead, 

including 
Thursday’s 
game 

against No. 5 Maryland.

But if Monday night gave her 

anything, it was some added 
confidence and the opportunity 
to have some fun. With 2:06 left 
against the Illini, Smith stole the 
ball at center court and broke 
away for an open layup.

As the ball fell through the 

rim, Smith flung her arms across 
one another as she skipped 
backward across the court.

Even a few days after a 

crippling performance, she was 
smiling, having fun and back to 
business.

Wednesday, January 28, 2015 // The Statement

This week I sat in my Economics 

102 lecture and learned about the 
utility function: the relationship 
between consumption and “happi-
ness” — conceptually measured in 
fictional units called utils.

Despite pages of textbooks and 

explanations from multiple pro-
fessors that economics is model-
based and not literally based, my 
anti-arithmetic mind rejected this 
form of measurement. How could a 
small graph and equation quantify 
human happiness?

But beyond this resistance, I 

questioned why and when and since 
when did humans feel the need for 
this type of economic organization. 
And if humans felt the need for eco-
nomic organization, at what point 
did humans desire a moral — or 
in some people’s eyes, religious — 
organization?

Humans organized economi-

cally in the early 18th century when 
Nicholas Bernoulli theorized the 
decision-making patterns of con-
sumers. Between Adam Smith, 
John Maynard Keynes and hun-
dreds of others, economics has 
evolved, but always continued to 
provide humans with a structure of 
looking at their world.

When humans were nomadic, 

they found a spirit in everything 
they interacted with: the river, the 

sun, powerful animals, great lead-
ers and themselves. The earliest 
form of religion was through imi-
tation of the things they admired. 
They found these concepts so pur-
poseful that they were driven to 
imitate them as a form of guidance 
for survival.

In his book, “A Man’s Search for 

Meaning,” Viktor Frankl chroni-
cles his experience in concentra-
tion camps during World War II. 
He observes that those who found 
meaning in their daily routine, 
despite their dire circumstances, 
were the ones who preserved and 
survived.

Karen Armstrong, a former 

Roman Catholic nun, wrote in her 
book “A History of God” about the 
evolution of three monotheistic 
religions: Judaism, Christianity 
and Islam. One observation that she 
makes is that the three religions, all 
in their own way, believe God is a 
figure that gives humans this type 
of purpose. The line of thinking 
translates to: God made you for a 
reason.

Humans across generations have 

found that religion gives them a 
purpose. Though, in some ways, I 
believe this sounds as if religion is 
a social crutch, there is no denying 
that it is also a tool that motivates 
humans to think about their mor-
als, their ethics and their purpose 
here on earth.

If religion grants purpose and if 

a concept of purpose grants a suc-
cessful life, then, like economic 
utils, fictional religious utils hold a 
valuable place in our world too.

All the Pretty Things: The Power of Choice

Throughout my life, I have 

encountered many choices that 
are no different from the ones 
facing every other person on this 
earth. Each day I encounter deci-
sions that must be made: choices 
concerning minor things, such 
as what to eat for lunch, to major 
decisions, such as what I wish to 
do with my life and my education. 
Each choice affects others, wheth-
er we see it now or not. And each 

choice I encounter has a time limit 
on it, a due date to make.

What college will I attend: Due 

April 30th, 2014.

What will I do with my summer: 

Due sometime before the school 
year ends.

What will I do this weekend: 

(Let’s be real) 9 p.m., Friday.

I have seen deadlines for all 

of these choices, except for one 
choice in my life I have yet to 

make. I was born to 
two amazing parents, 
both supportive, both 
my rock, one Polish, 
the other Black. In my 
eyes, they are no dif-
ferent. They are my 
parents, they love me. 
Who cares what they 
look like and, in exten-
sion, what I look like?

Questions 
from 

strangers and friends 
alike have come my 
way more and more 
often as I have grown 
older, asking, “What 
are you?” or “Why 

don’t you act black?”

Standardized tests in elemen-

tary school stared up at me with 
their blank bubbles, asking me 
to choose what I see myself as. I 
have encountered others who have 
attempted to decide the answer 
to this question for me (“You look 
black, so therefore you are”) and 
others that have decided, without 
even expressing it, through their 
treatment of me. This choice I 
have been asked to make has been 
a question that I still cannot confi-
dently answer.

I take pride in both sides of 

myself. I take pride in the rich his-
tories that flow through me. Holi-
day meals range from kielbasa to 
chitlins. Family stories touch on 
the segregated United States to 
work camps in Poland. I am lucky 
to be able to take both of these 
identities as my own.

As I think more and more about 

this decision, I see that I do not 
have to choose. This is the power 
of choice. I have the option to not 
choose. That is powerful.

Well, the start of this year would 

have been undeniably boring in the 
entertainment realm if the great 
Bulge-Gate of 2015 hadn’t swooped 
in and given us something to ponder 
for a solid week.

Apart from his various noise 

complaints and speeding incidents, 
Justin Bieber has been slowly 
phased out by the likes of other teen 
sensations such as One Direction 
and 5 Seconds of Summer. So, in an 
attempt to appeal to older audienc-
es and people in general, Bieber is 
featured in a campaign for the new-
est Calvin Klein underwear line as 
a very well-endowed model — or so 
it may appear.

People called bullshit on the 

spread right away. Think about it 
— while he has been working out 
more and is older, (have you seen 
the thin mustache that took him a 
year to grow, people?) it wasn’t long 
ago that Bieber looked and sounded 
like a prepubescent girl. To add fuel 
to the already scorching fire, once 
.gifs of Bieber’s alleged “before” — 

a.k.a. un-Photoshopped — photos 
were released, the Internet went 
rampant.

Bieber’s people have been stick-

ing to the story that there was no 
Photoshop fail. Even his personal 
trainer, presumably an expert on 
these matters (okay … ), came to his 
defense. So who should we believe?

This Photoshop scandal brings to 

light the entire concept of retouch-
ing and Photoshopping models and 
celebrities in ad campaigns, movies, 
magazine covers etc. I know girls 
on my Instagram feed, regular stu-
dents like us, who clearly Photoshop 
their pictures. But why? First of all, 
it takes way too much time, and sec-
ondly, people definitely notice when 
you look like a different person on 
social media than you do in person. 
But that’s beside the point. Society 
has placed unattainable norms on 
men and women. Women are sup-
posed to be skinny but curvy, with 
perfect hair and makeup all the 
time. And men are supposed to be 
fit and muscular and well-endowed 

in the ‘bulge’ department. While 
I’m not defending Justin Bieber, 
since his scandal gave me ample 
entertainment (and something to 
write about), the high standards 
need to end and, hopefully, the Pho-
toshopping will stop with it.

In light of all this, Selena Gomez, 

Bieber’s on-again, off-again girl-
friend/flame/stalker (why?) took 
to Instagram during the scandal, 
no doubt to try and get some of the 
attention back to her. In posting 
what people deem as a “cheeky” 
photo during what looks like a 
sad yoga sesh for one in a tropical 
paradise, she has given her cryp-
tic stance on the scandal at hand … 
move on, Selena.

This is the evidence thus far. But 

will we ever know? Was it stuffed? 
Enhanced? Photoshopped? Per-
haps we will know soon; as his 
career continues to plunge, I am 
sure a miracle, in the form of a sex 
tape, is in his imminent future. 
Maybe that’s why Selena’s doing all 
that yoga?

evin Bain stared down at the blank 
slate below him. With water dripping 
down his face, the diver concentrated, 
took a deep breath to clear his mind, then 
pushed forward.
Then a freshman, Bain was on the road 
competing for the Michigan men’s swim and 
dive team, but his work for the Wolverines 
that day was done. Mere moments after twist-
ing, contorting and testing his body in the 
pool, Bain had to take a different kind of test: 
the pencil-and-paper type much more familiar 
to University students.
“It’s always a balancing act,” said Bain, now 
a senior studying Business and Comparative 
Literature. “We may have to meet with pro-
fessors or group projects at odd hours, take 
exams on the road, just find different ways to 
make it work.
“I remember coming in as a freshman and 
mapping out my schedule, and it wouldn’t 
all fit,” he said. “It’s kind of a tug-of-war, and 
sometimes you have to make sacrifices, it 
works out, but it’s always a battle.”
Such is life for many of the 934 student-
athletes at Michigan. The unique dynamic of 
being among the nation’s best academically 
and athletically means those that balancing 
the two worlds is key. It’s rarely easy, fair, or 
fun, but the University ensures that athletes 
are given the opportunity to make it work.
***
Josh Bartelstein chuckles when thinking 
back on his senior year. As a captain of the 
2012-13 men’s basketball team, Bartelstein 
helped guide his team to its first Final Four 
and National Championship appearances in 
20 years.
But, as a teaching assistant and senior in 
Sport Management at the time, he remembers 
not having quite the same success in the class-
room.
“I think I went to four classes a week for 
that month,” Bartelstein said. “We were lucky 
to have chartered flights, or it could’ve been 
less. We were doing pretty much everything 
on the road. We always had our books, tutors, 
advisors — it was crazy really.”
The team was also lucky to have John 
Beilein at the helm. Taking over the program 
in 2007 — a program that hadn’t advanced to 
the NCAA Tournament since 1998 — the coach 
knew his team needed work ethic more than 
talent to survive at Michigan.
“They don’t always just recruit the best 
kids. They recruit kids that fit our culture and 

can do what we do academically,” Bartelstein 
said. “They need to be intelligent kids who are 
ready to work hard, otherwise they’ll have to 
go elsewhere.
“For some guys, it’s hard. It’s hard to write 
a 10-page paper as a sophomore knowing that, 
a year from now, you’ll make a million and a 
half dollars playing in the NBA. That’s where 
you see coach and his values kick in, because 
to him, it’s not really an option. You might hear 
guys complain. But it’s not either-or, it’s part of 
the whole package when you come here.”
That package deal translates to other sports. 
For Michigan hockey coach Red Berenson, it 
presents decisions that no coach likes to make.
With nine National Championships and 35 
NCAA Tournament appearances, the Wol-
verines draw interest from North America’s 
most talented hockey players. But to make it at 
Michigan, Berenson expects more.
“I’ve told kids, great hockey players, if you’re 
not interested in school, don’t come to Michi-
gan,” Berenson said. “I’m going to make your 
life miserable, and you’re going to make my 
life miserable, because that’s not what we’re 
doing here. If you’re coming here, you need to 
be hungry for an education and to become the 
best player you can, that’s what it’s all about.
“I’ll take hockey away from you in a heart-
beat if you aren’t doing what you’re supposed 
to do in school.”
***
Berenson can demand the hunger, because 
he had it too. Long before he knew he would 
spend 17 years in the NHL or 35 years as a 
coach, he was lacing it up for Michigan on the 
ice and in the classroom.
A business student with an unknown hock-
ey career ahead, Berenson didn’t dare distract 
himself. Even a seemingly small distraction 
like a TV in his room could hurt him.
“We were more on our own,” Berenson said. 
“We didn’t have the tutors, study tables, men-
tors. You were on your own, and don’t screw 
it up. Now, you’ve got more structure, you’ve 
got people around to keep an eye on you who 
know what your grades are, tutors available. 
It’s more structured for the student-athletes 
to succeed.”
This structure is good, Berenson said, given 
the increased demands on athletes. With 
national media attention, millions of dollars 
in funding, and thousands of fans attending 
games, Berenson knows that his players face 
greater pressure than he ever did
“There’s more demand on the student-ath-

letes today,” he said. “The season’s longer, the 
workout schedule is more difficult than ours 
was — you really have to balance your time and 
manage things well.”
Even with the resources available, that’s no 
small task. Business sophomore JT Compher, 
a forward, alternate captain on the hockey 
team and a second-round pick in the 2013 
NHL Draft, finds that with games just about 
every weekend, he is rarely available to partic-
ipate in group projects, a tough pill to swallow.
“The biggest challenge is my time con-
straints and meeting with groups,” Compher 
said. “Sometimes, I might not be able to meet 
with a group, but I make myself available to get 
the rundown and do whatever I can to help. 
It’s basically just managing my time when I’m 
not at the rink.”
But not all athletes experience the same aca-
demic workload. According to a 2008 report 
by the Ann Arbor News, athletes accounted 
for about half of the students enrolled in the 
University’s general studies program which 
offers potentially lighter workloads and flex-
ible requirements.
Bain said this stems from NCAA rules about 
declaring majors and progressing toward 
degrees efficiently. These rules, designed to 
ensure no one gets left behind, sometimes 
backfire, pushing athletes to general studies, 
Sport Management or other programs seem-
ingly tailored to their unique needs as stu-
dents.
“By the end of our junior year, we need to 
have 60 percent of our major finished,” he said. 
“If we try to switch majors and we don’t have 
the requirements for that major, we’re ineli-
gible. Athletes don’t really get the option to 
switch or change majors, so we may end up in 
majors that simply fit what we have.”
Bartelstein has seen this incidental funnel-
ing firsthand. While former teammates such 
as Zack Novak, Matt Vogrich and Jordan Mor-
gan sought degrees in business and engineer-
ing, many other teammates were steered away 
from such disciplines, even if indirectly.
“You have to know what you’re signing up 
for,” Bartelstein said. “If you want to do busi-
ness or engineering, no one will say no to you, 
but you have to understand the time commit-
ment and degree of difficulty certain classes 
present.
“You hear people at the academic center say 
things like ‘take this class’ or ‘stay away from 
this professor,’ but it’s not a forced decision. 
They want to make sure student-athletes are 

setting themselves up for success.”
That’s not to say it can’t happen, however. 
Bartelstein also saw his team, even in its rise 
to national prominence, make adjustments for 
players’ academic commitments.
“They’re probably happy they did it now, 
but there were times that they’d be missing 
sleep the night before a game or taking tests 
on the road,” he said regarding his teammates 
pursuing less flexible degrees. “There were 
times for a lot of guys where they were told 
‘I’m not sure you can do this, but if you want to 
put in the effort, we’ll make it work.’ So maybe 
guys miss practices or we work our schedule 
around exams, but Coach Beilein always made 
sure that academics were a priority, and we 
catered to that the best we could.”
Still, the numbers indicate Novak and the 
like are a minority group. More athletes major 
in Sport Management and general studies 
than any other majors, despite the fact that 
these programs may present less clear paths 
to jobs after college. This is in stark contrast 
to Berenson’s playing days, but the coach is 
learning that with the right mindset, any of his 
players can still find success.
“I think it’s fine, but I’d like them to pick a 
major and then go for it,” Berenson said. “A lot 
of them haven’t thought about it. They aren’t 
sure what they want to do, and my take is if 
(general studies) is what you want to do, then 
make sure you do well so you can go to gradu-
ate school once you’re done.”
***
The type-casting expands beyond majors. 
Just about every Michigan student knows 
the ‘athlete look.’ There’s the green Gatorade 
water bottle, the blue parkas and the matching 
Adidas backpacks. And there’s the tired, quiet 
expression, often accompanied with head-
phones and a spot toward the back of the class.
Regardless of their personal academic suc-
cesses, athletes can struggle to shake the ste-
reotypes associated with seemingly ‘easy’ 
majors, time away from class and cultural 
norms surrounding athletics.
Throw in the fact that Michigan athletes 
have a $12-million academic facility other 
students can’t use, along with free tutors and 
personal advisors, and the divide between ath-
letes and regular students is wider than ever.
“There’s definitely that stereotype,” Bartel-
stein said. “And some people at Michigan fit 
the mold, but I think too much is made of it.
“I know with our team we had academic 
conversations all the time, it wasn’t just go to 

class and then leave. Our classes were a huge 
part of our lives. We spent more time in classes 
and studying than we did anything basketball-
related.”
Bartelstein feels that the stereotype is truer 
for Michigan’s revenue sports: football, bas-
ketball and hockey. But Bain, who was recently 
nominated to be a Rhodes Scholar and serves 
as a member of the Student-Athlete Advisory 
Committee, sees it discourage smaller-sport 
athletes as well.
“People assume when I show up to class that 
I’m just at Michigan for athletics, not academ-
ics,” Bain says. “It sucks that they’re already 
judging us when they don’t know us, and kind 
of missing out on the interesting people that 
we might be.
“A lot of athletes don’t always wear their 
varsity jackets, because we just don’t want to 
deal with the stigma. It’d be great if we didn’t 
have to worry about teachers or students judg-
ing us before they met us.”
***
As a former student-athlete, Kinesiology 
Prof. Rebecca Hasson said she doesn’t try to 
treat student-athletes any differently than 
other students, but that the key to success 
when teaching students is communication.
“The athletes aren’t any more busy than any 
of the other students,” Hasson said. “Because 
the communication lines are open, we will try 
to work with one another’s schedules as much 
as possible. We make certain that if a student 
is doing poorly, we address it early on. Their 
grades are submitted to the Athletic Depart-
ment as well as to our offices, so they need to 
go to student services or come to office hours 
immediately.”
Hasson tries to be sensitive to the unique 
issues that arise for student-athletes, like 
high-pressure times around championships 
where a student could be missing weeks of 
classes, but she believes student-athletes have 
more to offer than just their athletic perspec-
tive.
“For the student-athletes, that is just one 
identity they hold,” Hasson said. “The student-
athletes are probably a little more outspoken, 
because they have those leadership skills on 
the court and can bring that to class.”
“If you just treat the student not as a stu-
dent-athlete, but as a student who just has very 
limited time but is as valuable to the class as 
any other student, that will make for the best 
learning environment.”
Hasson said she has seen more issues in 

younger student-athletes as they transition to 
college life.
“At the younger ages — and for all students, 
really — there is a lot of pressure and you are 
tired on top of everything, and it’s hard. As 
the students transition, they become great at 
time management, though. They work well 
in teams, and so I guess I come to athletes’ 
defense a little.”
“The stakes are higher here, but I think that 
in my experience, it’s not that the professors 
have to make special accommodations, but you 
just have to accept that you have to be willing 
to let a student miss class because that is the 
next step in their career. “
***
Jay Basten, a Sport Management professor, 
said each student-athlete is unique and has 
a different set of priorities, but overall their 
presence and participation in his classes, espe-
cially those that touch on college level sports, 
has added to the learning experience in the 
classroom.
“It’s great having student-athletes in those 
particular discussions, because it gives the 
non-athlete students some real insights into 
the challenging they face.” Basten said. “For 
me, I’ve been here for 15 years teaching in the 
program, and overall it has been very positive 
having them in the class. They are an impres-
sive group of students, but they do have some 
distinctive challenges.”
These challenges, Basten said, are dealing 
with limited time and balancing their other 
time commitments on the field or on the court. 
Addressing these issues as a professor is a bal-
ancing act as well. While Basten said he obvi-
ously must find alternative ways to ensure 
student-athletes are receiving and under-
standing the material in class, he also does not 
support making special concessions or differ-
ent standards for student-athletes.
“When student-athletes do have issues 
as far as conflicts, ultimately we believe that 
our classes are as important as their practice 
times,” Basten said. “I encourage them to come 
to office hours, but I particularly stress that 
they should come if they are missing classes, 
but I don’t really do anything proactive for any 
student, because I believe they need to be able 
to take responsibility for themselves.”

S

ince 2011, University students have been 
vaulting into the sports industry via the 
Michigan Sport Business Conference, an 

event planned, organized and run entirely by Uni-
versity students. The goal? Innovation.

Last year’s conference, which took place on 

Oct. 24, was entitled “Game Changers: Innovat-
ing Today. Defining Tomorrow.” The conference 
focused on how students can break into the sports 
industry — “How do get your first job in sports” 
was just one of the topics covered — and how future 
leaders can help the industry evolve, with panel dis-
cussions like the “Intersection of Sport and Urban 
Development.”

Innovation, however, was not only the theme of 

last year’s conference. It’s part of the organization’s 
refrain.

MSBC’s mission is “to inspire creativity and 

innovation in the sport industry and allow individ-
uals to build the relationships necessary to achieve 
their personal aspirations,” said Business junior 
Max Himelhoch, one of the MSBC’s newly elected 
co-presidents.

Last year the conference brought in approxi-

mately 400 Michigan students and 70 students 
from other colleges around the country as attend-
ees, according to fellow co-president and Kinesiol-
ogy junior Alyssa Duguay.

MSBC’s newly chosen organizing student team — 

which is technically a Ross School of Business club 
— has 31 members in total and is sectioned into five 
divisions: marketing, planning, team relationships, 
partners and speakers.

While the conference won’t happen again until 

sometime in late October or early November, the 
teams have already begun the extensive prepara-
tion process.

Himelhoch said that MSBC had its highest num-

ber ever of applicants for the organizing student 
team this year. Out of the 150 who applied, 75 were 
accepted for interviews before the final team was 
cut down to 31 people in total. Even last year’s team 
members had to re-interview.

The team looked for a set of diverse and passion-

ate students throughout its application process. 
Accepted members range from Sport Management 
and Business students to Communications majors, 
Art majors, and, of course, athletes.

This year they’re even trying a new “hybrid” pro-

gram for study-abroad students.

Kinesiology junior Morgan Bartelstein is cur-

rently in Prague. She’s also a communications 
coordinator working to keep a dialogue going with 
potential speakers.

“I think one of the things that allowed us to try 

this is that when we look for our new team, we’re 
looking for people that really want to be a part of it, 
who are passionate about working with us and will 
be dedicated to it,” Himelhoch said.

Himelhoch went on to say that being a part of 

MSBC’s organizing student team is invaluable to 
students hoping to enter the sport industry upon 

graduation.

“It gives anyone who’s interested in potentially 

going into those fields a chance to get some hands-
on experience here,” he said. “You leave at the end 
of the year, or at the end of however many years you 
spend with the conference, having really accom-
plished real, tangible things.”

It’s the skills developed, he says, that help stu-

dents create a future in the industry.

“I use them in interviews all the time, whether 

it’s the marketing plan that we made or just the 
experiences that we’ve had,” he said. “It’s been 
extremely valuable to everybody.”

Prior to becoming the upcoming conference’s 

co-president, Himelhoch was the vice president of 
marketing. As such, he helped develop a marketing 
plan that increased conference revenues by 65 per-
cent and increased the number of student tickets 
sold by 15 percent.

Likewise, Duguay added significantly to the con-

ference last year as former vice president of team 
relations. Kinesiology senior Josh Kadden, former 
brand director and vice president of partnerships, 
said that improvements in the internal organization 
could be accredited to Duguay.

Duguay is notably also the first woman co-pres-

ident that MSBC has had. She says that MSBC is 
“very progressive,” and that more women attend 
the conference each year.

“It is scary for women in the sport industry. 

Sometimes you feel like it’s a more masculine indus-
try to enter,” Duguay said, “but more and more 
women are attending.”

She further noted that the number female speak-

ers attending the conference each year is rising as 
well.

As for Kadden, he’s been a part of the organizing 

student team since the conference’s first year.

His division’s job has been to grow the MSBC 

“brand,” to legitimize it and make it more recogniz-
able. Duguay said that he and his team were instru-
mental to last year’s conference.

“He raised $60,000 in partnerships,” she said. 

“He was fundamental and we continue to push 
these new goals.”

Business senior David Carlson likewise has 

worked to push the organization’s goals and will 
continue to do so for the upcoming 2015 conference. 
Last year he was a “cross-functional committee 
member” on the brand team, which operates under 
the marketing division’s umbrella.

The project he focused on was called the “BIG” 

project, an acronym for “Build, Inspire and Grow.” 
At the conference each year, this BIG initiative pres-
ents 10 of the country’s best Sports Management or 
Sports Business students an award, honoring them 
for their extracurricular and in-classroom work.

“It gives them an opportunity to be recognized 

for their outstanding achievement,” Carlson said.

While members of the student group organize 

and run the conference, they also seek advice from 
two advisory groups — the Board of Directors, 

made up of five executives from the sport industry, 
and the Advisory Council, composed of recent grad-
uates of the program.

It’s in this way that members think about the 

MSBC organization like a business instead of a club, 
with tiers of factions and divisions.

Kinesiology senior David Herman, one of last 

year’s co-presidents, will soon sit on the Advisory 
Council.

As to the future of the conference, he spoke about 

self-innovation.

“What we really want for the conference is for it 

to not actually be thought of as a conference,” Her-
man said. “We want the MSBC to be a brand that is 
providing, creating, spreading the knowledge of the 
sport industry to students.”

He said soon the MSBC brand will be one that 

tells students where and how to find information 
about the sport industry, one that will help students 
network year-round.

“While the conference is our focus, ultimately we 

want to expand,” Herman said.

University alum Dustin Cairo, one of the co-

founders of MSBC and a current Advisory Council 
member, said the conference is looking to transition 
from what he calls “MSBC 1.0” to “MSBC 2.0.”

MSBC 1.0, he said, involved creating a founda-

tion for the conference — one made up of strong 
relationships with people in the sport industry, the 
School of Kinesiology, the Ross School of Business 
and the Athletic Department. He says the student 
team has done an “incredible job” with that first 
phase of MSBC.

The step that will launch the organization into 

MSBC 2.0 is a strategy summit slated for the end of 
February, he said. Ten to 15 individuals — includ-
ing alumni members and four to five current orga-
nizing students — will meet in New York City for a 
two-day strategy session. He hopes the session will 
lead to plans for innovation in five main areas of the 
MSBC organization.

From the student organizing team, the Advisory 

Board and the conference attendees, everyone in 
connection with the MSBC is looking to innovate.

They’re looking to innovate the sport industry 

itself, the MSBC as a business and their profession-
al selves. They’re looking to learn what it means to 
be a part of the sports industry and how to become 
successful within it.

Carlson emphasized this in speaking to why he 

attended the MSBC for the first time his freshman 
year.

“I’m interested in the industry and these people 

who are powerful in the industry, who have a lot of 
influence within the industry, are going to provide 
me with a learning experience,” he said.

“I’m going to learn the market, I’m going to learn 

what it took to bring a team or a brand or a sector of 
the industry to life. We were watching — firsthand 
— people talk about it, talk about their experience in 
that industry. That, to me, was the invaluable part. 
That’s why I think people show up.”

Conference allows students to engage in real-world 

sports business

Wednesday, January 28, 2015 // The Statement 
7B

L

ast month, I got coffee with my father. We stepped 
up to order, and I did what I always do when they 
ask for my name — I gave them a fake one. My dad 

did what he always does — he gave them a fake one too.

And then we looked at each other and laughed, just out 

of the sheer ridiculousness of it all — standing in a perfectly 
normal, incongruous Midwestern Starbucks at 1 p.m. on a 
Friday, ordering drinks using names that aren’t ours.

My name is Shoham. Sho-hom. It means onyx, like the 

rock. Like my father’s name, it comes from Hebrew, and like 
my father’s name, as I’ve discovered, there are about 1,000 
different ways to pronounce it in English, none of them quite 
correct.

A friend asked me recently if it felt like I was denying 

something about my identity when I didn’t fight for my 
name. I told him I didn’t know. I don’t remember when I 
stopped giving my name in situations when I didn’t have 
to. I come from a family of unpronounceable names, and it’s 
second nature to me at this point.

When I started college, I began to think about it again. 

A few weeks after meeting my roommate for the first time, 
we went out for lunch together. I, as I usually do, gave the 
person at the register the name Anne, my middle name. My 
roommate wasn’t really listening, but she caught it out of the 
corner of her ear and looked at me, both a little confused and 
distressed.

We’d only known each other for a few weeks, and she, to 

her credit, is both an incredibly nice person and someone 
who put genuine effort into learning my name without hav-
ing to ask. And so I explained, like I’ve done for a long time: 
It’s my middle name. My real name — Shoham, Sho-hom, s h 
o h a m — is too complicated to be scrawled on the side of an 
order or mangled by a Noodles and Co. employee, not worth 
my energy or time for a five-second interaction across the 
counter.

A name seems like such a small thing to think about, 

and it is. But it’s also a lifelong accumulation of hundreds 
of phone calls with secretaries, moments with friends and 
encounters with teachers, spelling out my name, explain-
ing how to pronounce my name, getting blank stares at my 
name, and that isn’t small.

A lot of my favorite moments are tied not to my full name, 

but to the nicknames people have built out of it over the past 
19 years. A series of sports coaches, calling out Sho’am down 
the field, in the stretch of time before my height advantage 
and accompanying goalie/basketball stardom faded.

The way people tend to find their way to Shosho, and how 

it sounds different from each one of them — my best friend at 
2 a.m. over the phone every night we spent studying senior 
year, my little sister when she’s feeling sassy. The group of 
friends I met over our sleep-deprived Welcome Week fresh-
man year who all call me Sho.

These names come with the person, the relationship, the 

territory, and I like all (read: most) of them because of that.

But I’ve never specifically offered these substitutes up 

when people struggle with my name, though I like (almost) 
all of them. I’ve never gone by Anne full time either, though I 
thought about it when I started high school, and again when 
I started college. I don’t fight for my name because it’s so 
very often not worth it, but I have stuck by it.

When I come home, my parents, native Hebrew speakers 

both, call me Shoham, sho-hom, s h o h a m. They pronounce 
it better than I ever have, or probably ever will.

For a long time, that didn’t mean much to me, but then 

I left for college and it started meaning something more — 
my name started feeling like home. A home I don’t share 
with baristas, or Noodles and Co. employees, but something 
important, something special, my culture and my family, all 
wrapped up into one.

I joke a lot that should I have kids, I’ll give them shitty 

(read: similarly unpronounceable) names to build character. 
And I might. But I’ll do it with the knowledge that although 
it might take a long time for it to mean something — to come 
with a relationship, a territory, a person — in the end, it will 
at the very least mean family.

Even if it’s just family solidarity in lying to Starbucks 

baristas.

If you have never seen a Raas team in action, I would highly recommend it. On 

Saturday, I followed the teams competing in the Dandia Dhamaka Raas Competition, a 
competition between univer≠≠sities from across the United States in traditional Indian 
dance. Competitors, including Carnegie Mellon University and Standford University, 
prepared their elaborate make-up and costumes at a nearby hotel and were bused to the 
Michigan Theater, where the event was held. Each team combined their costumes and 
props to fit a theme that they conveyed through dance with enthusiasm and high energy.
