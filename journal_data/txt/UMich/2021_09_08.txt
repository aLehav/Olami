The brass Block ‘M’ in the 

center of the Diag is usually 
clear of footprints, with students 
sharply changing their trajectory 
to safely avoid trodding upon it and 
tempting academic fate. However, 
during Festifall on Sept. 1 and 2, the 
sidewalks throughout the Diag and 
Ingalls Mall were so packed with 
U-M community members that 
numerous individuals walked over 
the infamous ‘M’ to navigate the 
large crowd. 

After operating as a completely 

virtual experience last September, 
Festifall — an annual campus 
involvement 
fair 
showcasing 

over 800 U-M programs and 
organizations — returned in-person 
over a three-day period for the fall 
2021 semester. At the outdoor event, 
U-M students perused many of the 
clubs, honors societies, academic 
certification 
programs, 
project 

teams and social and professional 
organizations 
available 
at 
the 

University of Michigan.

Heather Guenther, communications 

director for the U-M Division of 
Student Life, wrote in an email 
to The Michigan Daily that the 
number of students involved in 
student organizations significantly 
decreased over the 2020-2021 
academic year.

As a result, this year’s Festifall 

was the biggest yet, with a record-
breaking number of organizations 
attempting to recruit new members 
and rebuild after a year of mostly 
virtual activities.

“More student organizations 

applied at the last minute compared 
to previous years,” Guenther wrote. 
“Given 
the 
notable 
transition 

for 
many 
organizations, 
812 

organizations participated this year, 
more than 200 more compared to 
previous in-person events.”

The Daily spoke with several 

Festifall participants, a majority of 
whom agreed the in-person event 
made it easier to connect with 
different vendors than in a virtual 
setting. In particular, many said 
they were more likely to attend the 
event this year because they could 
simply follow the crowd from table 
to table and did not have to worry 
about 
“Zoom 
Anxiety” 
when 

speaking with an organization.

Engineering sophomore Gordy 

Gwilt attended Festifall online 
last year and was representing the 
student organization he joined, 
Michigan Mock Trial, at their 
booth on the Diag on Sept. 1. Gwilt 
said navigating Festifall online last 
year was somewhat overwhelming 
since it was time-consuming to 
collect information about different 
organizations. 

“Last year with it being online, 

it was kind of hard to just walk 
around and see random clubs,” 
Gwilt said. “You kind of had to 
know what you wanted (to join) 
going in.”

Some 
student 
organizations 

took advantage of the in-person 
format by putting on eye-catching 
demonstrations for the crowd. 
Notably, members of the cheer 
team donning bright yellow shirts 
spread out across the Diag on Sept. 
1 and ran through a series of short 
routines for onlookers. 

Information senior Benjamin 

Millunchick, a member of the 
cheer team, spoke with interested 
students as they stopped to 
watch the performance. Having 
experienced Festifall previously in 
both in-person and online formats, 

Millunchick said the cheer team 
benefits from being able to perform 
for attendees and explain their 
competitive schedule.

Millunchick said that after a 

year of socially distant coursework 
and extracurriculars, the size and 
energy of the crowd might inspire 
students to join new organizations 
and meet new friends.

“I forgot how many people go to 

school here,” Millunchick said.

Despite — and because of — the 

energy surrounding the event, 
not everyone felt comfortable 
with the size of the crowd. In 
an attempt to adapt Festifall to 
concerns surrounding COVID-
19, the University chose to spread 
the event out over three days, as 
opposed to one.

Aug. 31’s activities were held 

in the Grove on North Campus 
in an attempt to de-densify the 
Central 
Campus 
events, 
and 

all 
organization 
tables 
were 

spaced 6-feet apart. Because the 
University does not require masks 
outdoors, the majority of attendees 
were unmasked.

Even 
without 
a 
specific 

requirement, LSA sophomore Tara 
Yu elected to keep her mask on. Yu 
told The Daily being in close contact 
with so many unmasked people 
made her feel uncomfortable. Yu 
said she appreciated that the event 
was outdoors, but suggested it 
might be even safer if everyone was 
wearing masks.

“I didn’t imagine that there 

would be so many people here (at 
Festifall),” Yu said. “Right now, 
with the delta variant going on, 
it might be better for everyone to 
wear a mask.”

After two and a half semesters 

of virtual learning and social 
distancing, many students said they 
were excited to return to a semblance 
of normalcy yet still nervous about 
the delta variant as they headed back 
to the classroom this past week. 

With 91% of this semester’s classes 

now in person, many students told 
The Michigan Daily they were 
relieved to make the transition from 
Zoom calls to lecture halls. 

Between 
awkward 
breakout 

rooms and all-too-real Zoom fatigue, 
some students particularly felt the 
absence of one-on-one connections 
that 
once 
defined 
in-person 

instruction, LSA senior Alex Meyer 
said.

“We were lacking face-to-face 

contact (during virtual learning),” 
Meyer said. “It’s harder to build 
relationships with classmates and 
professors over Zoom.”

Looking back on the past year and 

a half, LSA junior Regan Monnett 
found that the challenges of virtual 
learning made this week’s return 
to the classroom all the more 
memorable.

“The 
past 
year 
makes 
me 

appreciate the classroom in person 
much more,” Monnett said. “It also 
helps me remember to be patient 
with everyone because everyone’s 
adapting as everything goes along.”

As eager as students are to be 

back in the classroom, concerns 
over the looming threat of the delta 
variant still linger among both the 
student body and faculty. COVID-
19 cases have risen in Michigan to 
nearly double their September 2020 
numbers.

“I’m definitely nervous about how 

things are and have been in terms of 
COVID,” Monnett said. “Some of the 
buildings have been very busy so far, 
which is nerve-wracking.”

Just as flexibility and resilience 

were key to navigating the last three 
semesters, the past week has already 
tested students’ ability to adjust in a 
period of unfamiliarity, Meyer said.

“Even just my habits of taking 

notes, it’s harder to get back into it 
now as opposed to before. It’s a lot 
harder to pay attention,” Meyer said.

Many students said they felt 

nervous in anticipation of this 
week’s 
in-person 
classes. 
This 

was especially true for LSA junior 
Brianna Evans, who transferred to 
the University this past year.

“I was really nervous because I 

hadn’t learned in person in a while 
and because I’ve never been here 
before,” Evans said. “I was anxious 
about finding classes, but so far, it’s 
been okay.”

Now that Kinesiology junior Peter 

Grobel — who transferred to the 
University his sophomore year — is 
able to experience in-person classes 
for the first time, he said he is excited 
to finally learn what it means to be a 
Wolverine.

“I hope to get the full Michigan 

experience, having all clubs and all 
classes in person,” Grobel said. “It’s 
just nice to have everything up to full 
speed, albeit (with) masks and some 
restrictions.”

Students fill every classroom, 

residence hall and library, reviving 
the 
once-desolate 
campus 
he 

experienced during his first year at 
the University, Grobel said.

“Campus is definitely much more 

lively compared to last year when it 
was completely empty,” Grobel said. 
“There would be two people at the 
bus stop, and now you see lines of 
freshmen going and going. Campus 

is alive again.”

This spirited atmosphere has 

welcomed many new faces to 
campus. Countless times over the 
past week, Art & Design freshman 
Mari Kamidoi said they witnessed 
campus-wide kindness firsthand.

“My first impression of Michigan 

was that everyone’s really friendly,” 
Kamidoi said. “I haven’t met a single 
unfriendly person.”

Uncertainty remains a defining 

theme of the 2021 school year, with 
many students unsure of what the 
fall semester will ultimately look 
like. While grateful for in-person 
instruction, Meyer anticipates a 
return to online learning in the 
coming months.

“Most of my labs are using a mixed 

format now with a whole section 
built around virtual learning,” Meyer 
said. “I’m sort of expecting that we 
can see a return to virtual classroom 
classes come mid-semester, so I’m 
keeping my expectations low.”

Hundreds of University faculty 

and Graduate Student Instructors 
have signed a petition calling for 
greater COVID-19 planning and 
safety precautions, citing the rising 
threat of the delta variant and its 
potential to infect vaccinated people. 
In an email to faculty Sept. 2 — 
which some faculty said they found 
insufficient — University President 
Mark Schlissel and Provost Susan 
Collins said classrooms are the 
“safest place” to be this semester in 
response to the faculty and GSI’s 
demands for more detailed COVID-
19 guidelines. 

For the time being, however, 

students are making the most 
of in-person instruction as they 
continue to tackle school in the age 
of COVID-19.

The lecturers’ union, if they 

vote to strike, likely will not do so 
until next week.

The University of Michigan 

Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization, 
the 
union 

representing 
non-tenure 

track faculty, has reached an 
agreement with the University’s 
administration Tuesday to extend 
their current contract to Sept. 15. 

“Given LEO’s commitment to 

secure a contract and our hope 
that the mediation and bargaining 
this week will be fruitful, the 
Union has proposed a contract 
extension until September 15th,” 
LEO President Kirsten Herold said 
in a statement to The Michigan 
Daily. “The Employer has agreed 
and we will continue to engage in 
the bargaining process.”

The 
extension 
will 
allow 

negotiations 
between 
the 

University’s and LEO’s lawyers 
over contract terms to resume 
through Sept. 15. It follows 
weeks of negotiations after the 
organization gave the University 
an ultimatum to negotiate a new 
contract by Sept. 8. 

University 
spokesperson 

Rick Fitzgerald confirmed LEO 
reached out to extend their 
contract 
and 
the 
University 

agreed. According to Fitzgerald, 
LEO and the University met with 
the state mediator Tuesday and 
have another session scheduled for 

Thursday. LEO and the University 
also 
scheduled 
a 
bargaining 

session for this upcoming Friday. 

“From 
the 
University’s 

perspective we’re prepared to 
continue bargaining as often 
as needed to get a settlement,” 
Fitzgerald said. “We would take 
this indication from LEO of 
extending the contract another 
week as a positive sign in the 
negotiation process.”

When the lecturers’ contract 

ends on Sept. 15, the LEO 
members will no longer have to 
abide by the collective bargaining 
agreement and can vote to strike. 
If LEO does choose to go on strike 
following the Sept. 15 deadline, 
it will still violate rules from the 
state of Michigan prohibiting 
public employees from going on 
strike. 

Last 
fall, 
the 
Graduate 

Employees’ 
Organization’s 

members elected to strike after 
their 
contract 
negotiations 

with 
the 
University 
failed. 

This resulted in a procession of 
protests and rallies across campus 
as well as cancellation of many 
Graduate 
Student 
Instructor-

taught classes throughout the 
strike’s progression.

The University sued GEO in 

response, on the grounds that 
both the Public Employment 
Relations Act and GEO’s collective 
bargaining agreement prohibited 
the strike.

The Michigan Daily sat down with 

the Regent Jordan Acker (D), chair of 
the University of Michigan Board of 
Regents, to discuss the University’s 
plans for addressing COVID-19 
concerns, the new Equity, Civil Rights 
and Title IX office, the expansion 
of the Go Blue Guarantee, climate 
change initiatives, Ron Weiser and 
more. This interview has been edited 
and condensed for clarity.

The Daily cannot independently 

verify 
Acker’s 
comments 
on 

documented 
cases 
of 
classroom 

transmission at the University of 
Michigan.

The Michigan Daily: What is 

your response to the University of 
Michigan faculty signing petitions 
this 
week 
requesting 
stronger 

COVID-19 
protections 
for 
the 

fall semester? How do you plan 
to address concerns surrounding 
COVID-19 guidelines?

Jordan Acker: Well, I think 

that one of the things that we’ve 
done really well is keep everyone 
safe in the classroom, whether it’s 

vaccine 
requirements, 
masking 

requirements. We still haven’t had a 
single documented case of classroom 
transmission. All the public health 
experts suggest that our current 
path forward is the right one to 
balance that in-person experience 
that we can only have in Michigan, 
with a mask in a classroom, with the 
safety of our staff, with the safety 
of our faculty, with the safety of 
our students. The best way to get 
there is to make sure that everyone 
is vaccinated. We’re getting there 
— the students are doing a great 
job, the faculty is getting there, the 

staff is getting there. But we need 
to be there to make sure that we’re 
protecting everybody.

TMD: How do you believe the 

creation of the Equity, Civil Rights 
and Title IX office to replace the 
Office 
of 
Institutional 
Equity 

will place a greater emphasis on 
supporting prevention and reporting 
efforts? And are there any other 
initiatives or policies you support 
that you’d like to see implemented 
this year addressing prevention and 
reporting efforts?

Many of the participating 

organizations 
also 
tried 
to 

reduce the amount of close 
contact between attendees by 
asking them to scan QR codes 
to access information and sign-
up forms rather than handing 
out large paper flyers. Guenther 
wrote the amount of paper 
waste left behind at the end of 
this year’s event was “notably 
less” than it was at previous 
in-person Festifalls.

LSA senior Sara Trumza 

said 
her 
organization, 
the 

Multicultural 
Association 
of 

Pre-Health 
Students, 
posted 

QR codes linking to their social 
media accounts to limit paper 
waste and touchpoints.

“We thought with COVID it 

would be a lot easier for people 
to just use their phone to scan 
the QR code and then they would 
have access to our Instagram 
page,” Trumza said. “It is just 
a one-stop for everything that 
we have, just in case students 
don’t feel comfortable touching 
anything.”

Apart 
from 
student 

organizations, 
several 
local 

businesses set up tables in a 
closed-off section of North 
University Avenue to pass out 
free gifts and showcase their 
merchandise. 

Josh 
Lee, 
the 
program 

manager 
for 
student 

development at the Center for 
Campus Involvement, helped 
organize Festifall and wrote 
in an email to The Daily that 
vendors first participated in 
Festifall in 2019 but were not 
present in 2020 due to the 

virtual format. 

“The big change this year 

was 
placing 
Vendors 
on 

North University,” Lee wrote. 
“Community 
vendors 
are 

another great pathway to get 
students 
connected 
to 
the 

greater A2 community, and 
we felt that the partnership 
was important and warranted 
continuing this year.”

In her email to The Daily, 

Guenther wrote that funds 
collected 
from 
vendor 

participation helped to offset 
the operating costs associated 
with Festifall, reducing the 
cost to $30 this year for student 
organizations to secure a table.

U-M alum Rishi Narayan, 

founder 
of 
local 
business 

Underground 
Printing, 
said 

this is his company’s first time 
participating in Festifall. 

“We just want to meet our 

customers, maybe meet some 
new customers and hand out 
some free stuff,” Narayan said.

Another 
local 
business, 

Sweetwaters 
Coffee 
and 

Tea, attended Festifall with 
a 
different 
goal 
in 
mind. 

Though they were handing 
out free cold brew samples to 
students, Megan Paddock, the 
manager of the Sweetwaters at 
the Michigan Union, said her 
main objective was to hire new 
student baristas. 

“We’re hoping that this is going 

to be a good hiring event and 
giving students the opportunity 
to find a job that is flexible with 
their schedules, and that’s also 
fun,” Paddock said.

FESTIFALL
From Page 1

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily

Students gather for Festifall on the Diag Sept. 2.

ADMINISTRATION
Schlissel, Strickman discuss new Equity, 

Civil Rights, and Title IX Office

ECRT replaces the oft-criticized Office of Institutional Equity

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
and 

Tamiko Strickman, director of 
the new Equity, Civil Rights and 
Title IX Office, sat down with 
The Michigan Daily on Sept. 2 to 
discuss updates to the University’s 
mechanisms 
for 
investigating 

allegations of sexual misconduct 
and other crimes. The interview 
began with Schlissel and Strickman 
giving opening remarks regarding 
the status of the new ECRT office, 
followed by an interview with 
The Daily. This article has been 
condensed and edited for clarity.

You can read part one of the 

interview, which discusses past 
controversies 
with 
OIE 
and 

lawsuits against Strickman from 
her time at the University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln, on our website 
at michigandaily.com.

Mark Schlissel: For us to 

really change and improve, we’ve 
got to look at three categories 
of things: the structures we use 
around our issues of misconduct, 
the 
actual 
policies 
and 
our 

culture. We’ve been announcing 
policy changes, like the policy 
about 
relationships 
between 

supervisors 
and 
supervisees. 

Along with those policies, the 
ECRT is a structure that allows 
us to do many things. We really 
want to be a place where every 
member of our community feels 
respected, safe and supported. 
We’re working hard on a new anti-
retaliation policy, and that’ll come 
out in the coming months. We also 
are committed to education and 
prevention so that we can prevent 
(misconduct) to begin with. We 
hope all these things, when you 
put them together, really put us 
on a path to be amongst the best 
universities when it comes to 
sexual misconduct. 

The Equity, Civil Rights and 

Title IX Office is central to 
these efforts. We took the Office 

of Institutional Equity apart 
and rebuilt a new organization, 
covering the functions of the 
old OIE but in a different way — 
one that’s designed to provide 
better support, more outreach, 
better education and integrate 
prevention efforts along with our 
other investigatory efforts. 

Tamiko Strickman: It’s a 

really exciting time right now. 
Shortly after the announcement 
in July, we were able to post 
the positions for the equity 
specialists, who are a critical 
change for the ECRT. You’re 
familiar with the critique of 
OIE-type offices, that oftentimes 
the initial contact feels cold and 
intimidating when it’s from an 
investigator. 
Survivors 
aren’t 

prepared sometimes for that 
outreach, 
and 
these 
equity 

specialists will serve as what 
I like to call a soft outreach, or 
a buffer between the survivor 
and the initial meeting with the 
investigator. 

Once that survivor makes a 

decision on the most appropriate 
and 
comfortable 
path 
for 

themselves, the equity specialists 
will 
work 
alongside 
the 

investigator to continue providing 
that support for both parties who 
are involved in an investigation. 
So when somebody says, “This 
has just been an emotional time 
for me, I have an exam coming up 
and I really need a modification,” 
it would be the equity specialists 
that would help to facilitate that. 
We will start our final interviews 
in the coming weeks and engage 
some of our campus partners to 
help make those decisions. 

We are very close to finalizing 

the position for an outcomes 
officer. That will be a critical 
position as well to ensure that 
these cases are completed, and if 
there are recommended steps or 
sanctions, that they are followed 
through upon. 

The third position that we are 

hoping to post next week will 
be the Director of Prevention 
Education 
Assistance 
and 

Resources. And we’ll start to 
build out all of the prevention 

and education efforts, working 
very 
closely 
with 
SAPAC 

(Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center), collaborating 
with 
our 
faculty 
research 

expert partners, partnering and 
continuing working with the 
Center for Research on Learning 
& Teaching.

MS: Tami and I now work 

directly together, so this will 
come to me to make sure that 
it has the full attention of the 
campus and the resources it 
needs to be successful.

The Michigan Daily: In July, 

it was announced that ECRT 
will oversee a new department of 
Prevention, Education Assistance 
and 
Resources 
(PEAR) 
that 

aims to develop and distribute 
materials 
on 
sexual 
assault 

prevention and support. Under 
the new department, PEAR would 
also institute a liaison program 
that would “designate a member 
of each department to be a point 
of contact for any information 
or resources regarding sexual 
misconduct and discrimination.” 
How 
will 
said 
department 

members be selected, and what 
will they be trained to do with the 
information they receive? 

TS: One of the ways that we’re 

starting to get some information 
on these liaisons are people who 
are interested in the cause. For 
example, when ECRT goes in 
and does a training program 
in a particular unit, I will have 
particular people reach out to 
say, “Look, I’m really interested 
in this subject matter and any 
opportunities for partnership.” 
I’m a big believer that people 
are most receptive to messaging 
through their peers and their 
colleagues. 

The training will be through 

ECRT in the beginning to talk 
about things like if somebody 
comes to you and asks a question 
about reporting, here’s a bullet 
point list of talking points. So it 
would be an ongoing training. We 
would build it out more robustly 
as the program develops more 
and more. 

TMD: In the past, OIE has 

investigated less than 10% of 
reported 
allegations 
due 
in 

part to some allegations falling 
“outside the scope of University 
policy,” according to a 2017-2018 
OIE report. Under the ECRT, do 
you plan to expand the scope of 
University policy to investigate a 
greater percentage of allegations? 
What constitutes an allegation 
to be “outside the scope of 
University policy”?

TS: A lot of factors come 

into play, because oftentimes 
somebody may say “I don’t want 
an investigation, I’d like to be 
able to drop out of this course 
right now because somebody is 
in that course who makes me feel 
uncomfortable, but I don’t need 
an investigation, I’m just looking 
to withdraw with no penalty or 
adverse impact to my academic 
record.” A lot of times people 
will say, “I’m looking for some 
alternative form of resolution,” 
perhaps student-to-student, so 
we go over to the OSCR (Office 
of Student Conflict Resolution) 
office, sit down with the experts 
there and come to some type 
of agreement. So we continue 
to address every civil rights 
allegation or report that comes 
into our office; there are just a 
menu of ways to handle it and we 
try to take into account what that 
person is requesting. 

MS: There are some reports 

that we don’t have jurisdiction 
over, like somebody who’s a 
member of our community but 
is complaining about someone 
who has nothing to do with the 
University at all. Other instances 
where 
there’s 
a 
complaint 

about 
troublesome 
behavior, 

but it doesn’t qualify as being 
harassment or violation of civil 
rights, it’s just a complaint. So 
there are lots of reasons, but 
the goal is to investigate and 
have a good resolution of every 
complaint that comes forward, 
and sometimes it’s through an 
investigation. Other times it’s 
through these other mechanisms 
that Tami mentioned.

ADMINISTRATION
‘U’ leaders defend COVID-19 
policies after faculty pushback

Schlissel: Classroom ‘the safest place to be on campus’

University of Michigan President 

Mark Schlissel and Provost Susan 
Collins defended fall semester 
COVID-19 guidelines in a Sept. 2 
email to concerned faculty, stating 
that “perhaps the safest place to be 
on campus this fall will be in the 
classroom.”

“Stellar rates of vaccination, 

paired 
with 
an 
indoor 
face-

covering requirement for all, make 
the classroom a very safe learning 
environment for instructors and 
students,” Schlissel and Collins 
wrote.

The message Sept. 2 was sent 

in response to an Aug. 26 faculty 
petition asking the University 
administration to provide more 
stringent COVID-19 guidelines for 
the fall semester. More than 740 
instructors signed the petition, 
which requested more flexibility 
for instructors to teach remotely, 
mandatory testing for all members 
of the campus community, six feet 
of social distancing between people 
and a mandatory 14-quarantine 
period for vaccinated close contacts 
of positive cases.

In 
response, 
Schlissel 
and 

Collins 
wrote 
that 
multiple 

prevention strategies — such as 
indoor face mask requirements, 
increased air ventilation and the 
ResponsiBlue app — are part of 
a layered approach to mitigating 
COVID-19 spread. 

Course 
instruction 
methods 

have been evaluated by individual 
schools and colleges within the 
University, according to Schlissel 
and Collins, and those units 
have control over the amount 
of in-person, hybrid and online 
classes that are offered. 

In terms of individual COVID-19 

concerns for instructors, Schlissel 
and Collins wrote that faculty 
should contact Work Connections, 
the 
University’s 
disability 

management program, to report 
their personal disability or medical 
conditions.

But a group of faculty calling 

themselves 
“community 

advocates” wrote in an email to 
fellow petitioning faculty Sept. 3 
that the University was still not 
providing the autonomy to make 
decisions based on their risk 
assessments.

“We are also disappointed that 

we have again been directed to 
Work Connections, a unit that 
has rejected numerous requests 
by instructors with serious pre-
existing conditions, compromised 
immunity, and other risk factors, 
or who have family members 
with 
various 
vulnerabilities 

(including children too young to 
be vaccinated),” the faculty group 
wrote.

92% of students and 90% of 

faculty are fully vaccinated, and 
Schlissel and Collins wrote that 
information on students who are 
unvaccinated in classes would be 
shared when and if the indoor face 
covering policy is lifted. Schlissel 
and Collins wrote they believe 
there 
are 
enough 
COVID-19 

mitigation policies in place to safely 
conduct in-person classes.

“Living and working through 

a 
pandemic 
is 
unsettling,” 

Schlissel and Collins wrote. “It’s 
unpredictable and, yes, it involves 
an unavoidable level of risk. As an 
institution, we believe we have 
taken all appropriate measures 
to mitigate that risk for you, your 
faculty colleagues, your students 
and the staff members.”

Schlissel and Collins wrote that 

everything involves a level of risk 

that has to be balanced against the 
importance of other tasks.

“We all recognize the risk of 

auto crashes, yet most of us accept 
that risk by driving to campus each 
day to teach, serve others, or help 
patients heal,” Schlissel and Collins 
wrote.

The 
“community 
advocates” 

took issue with the comparison to 
driving, saying that faculty are not 
forced to drive to work the same 
way they are being pushed to go 
back to in-person teaching.

The faculty group also wrote that 

Schlissel and Collins’ message did 
not address most of their critiques 
of existing procedures. They said 
in-person teaching without taking 
the measures outlined in their 
petition is a risk to faculty. 

“Many of the policies in place 

strike us as an alpha variant 
response to a delta variant world,” 
the faculty group wrote.

Schlissel and Collins’ statement 

on classrooms being the “safest 
place on campus” also received 
negative feedback from the faculty 
group, which said there is no 
documentation of classrooms being 
safe from COVID-19 transmission. 

“We are dismayed by President 

Schlissel’s 
repetition 
of 
the 

assertion 
that 
classrooms 
are 

‘perhaps the safest place to be on 
campus this fall,’ which, to the 
best of our knowledge, has not 
been documented,” the faculty 
group wrote. “We are disappointed 
that President Schlissel has not 
provided detailed information on 
our classroom environments, such 
as the percentage of students in our 
classes who are vaccinated.”

JA: The process that went into 

creating the ECRT was one of the 
initiatives that I really worked 
hard on as the vice chair of the 
board with Regent Ilitch to get 
done last year as part of a holistic 
approach toward making sure that 
our campus was safer — not just 
prior to any sort of misconduct 
happening on the education side, 
but also making sure that we 
support survivors afterward. We 
have a lot of work to do still on this.

One of the things that I 

mentioned in my remarks at 
our last Regents meeting, and 
that I still strongly support, is 
the creation of an ethics and 
compliance office. I think we 
need it — most AAU (Association 
of American Universities) schools 
have it already. The fact that 
we don’t is, frankly, a glaring 
hole in our regime of preventing 
misconduct of any kind. And as 
we see some of the things that 
happened in the past, especially 
involving Martin Philbert, this 
sort of office would have gone a 

long way toward making sure that 
didn’t happen. So that would be 
the biggest initiative. But I think 
there’s still more work to do. I 
think the cultural journey is going 
to be very important. And I think 
we still have to keep looking at 
our peer institutions, seeing what 
they’re doing, and making sure 
that we follow the path of best 
practices amongst our public and 
private peer institutions. 

TMD: How do you think 

the expansion of the Go Blue 
Guarantee free tuition program 
to the University of Michigan’s 
Flint and Dearborn campuses this 
year will ensure more academic 
opportunity 
for 
lower-income 

students within the University of 
Michigan system?

JA: It’s a big step. I think that 

first and foremost, adding our 
Dearborn and Flint campuses was 
crucial to providing the promise 
of the Go Blue Guarantee. But it’s 
just a start. One of the things that 
we need to think about is where 
experts are (aware of) when it 
comes to students who come 
from low-income backgrounds is 
making sure that we’re not just 
talking about free tuition. We’re 

not just talking about the cost 
of education, although that’s a 
very important part, but we need 
to make sure that we raise our 
graduation rates.

Frankly, some of the things 

that we need to work on most are 
raising our graduation rates in 
Flint and Dearborn. It’s one thing 
to get into school and to start 
school and to have free tuition 
there. But the most important 
thing is to leave those campuses 
or our Ann Arbor campus with a 
degree. Our graduation rates in 
Ann Arbor are pretty high, and in 
Flint and Dearborn, they need to 
get higher.

When we talk about as a board 

where we’re spending money and 
on what services, making sure 
that we raise our graduation rate 
is crucial. Yes, affordability is the 
number one challenge, but we also 
don’t want anybody graduating 
with any sort of student debt and 
not having the degree that will 
allow them to pay it off. We need to 
do more to raise those graduation 
rates, period.

CAMPUS LIFE
Bus routes adjusted after long 

waits, overcrowding issues

Student frustration brings back pre-pandemic lines

Starting Sept. 7, the University 

of Michigan will restore bus 
routes used prior to the pandemic 
following increasing concern from 
students during the first week of 
the fall 2021 semester.

The Sept. 2 announcement of 

the updated routes come after 
students reported long wait times 
and overcrowding on buses, with 
some noting that lines at the CCTC 
stretched back to the School of 
Dentistry. Some students said 
they had to walk to North Campus 
to be on time for class, while 
others said they were concerned 
about contracting COVID-19 on a 
crowded bus.

The 
Bursley-Baits 
and 

Northwood bus routes that ran 
between 
North 
and 
Central 

Campus before the pandemic will 
be returning, according to the 
announcement.

The reinstated Bursley-Baits 

route will run from 7:15 a.m. to 
2:00 a.m. on weekdays and from 
8:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Saturdays 

and Sundays. Rides are expected 
to run at 15-minute frequencies, 
according to the announcement. 

Northwood will return to 

use from 7:15 a.m. to 1:55 a.m. on 
weekdays and from 8:00 a.m. 
to 2:00 a.m. on Saturdays and 
Sundays. Rides are expected to 
run at 20-minute frequencies.

The Oxford Shuttle will return 

to operation on weekends from 
5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. at 15-minute 
intervals. New route information 
will be updated on the Logistics, 
Transportation & Parking website 
early next week, though the new 
routes will not be available on the 
Magic Bus app, according to the 
announcement.

These updated routes will run 

in place of the Bursley-Baits and 
Northwood loops that were part 
of the “hub-and-spoke” system 
developed by Transit Services 
and faculty from the College of 
Engineering last school year. 
The “hub-and-spoke” model was 
created to provide more frequent 
trips between North Campus’s 
Pierpont 
Commons 
and 
the 

Central Campus Transit Center 
as well as to reduce time spent in 
the bus per ride in light of COVID-
19. It offers two shorter “spoke” 

routes: the Bursley-Baits loop and 
the Stadium-Diag loop.

In an email to The Michigan 

Daily 
the 
day 
before 
the 

announcement 
of 
reinstated 

routes, University spokesperson 
Kim 
Broekhuizen 
attributed 

the long wait times to a “serious 
labor shortage” affecting Transit 
Services as they adjust to serving 
more students on campus.

“One area where we have been 

hit the hardest is in the recruitment 
of temporary and student drivers,” 
Broekhuizen wrote on Sept. 1. 

Sept. 2’s announcement also 

specifies safety and preventative 
measures, 
including 
a 
face 

mask requirement, installment 
of moveable shields between 
passengers 
and 
drivers, 
and 

increased air circulation through 
open windows. Drivers are also 
encouraged to keep doors open at 
stops for increased ventilation, and 
cleaning protocols for frequently 
used surfaces will remain in place.

It’s nine on Sunday morning, and Eileen 

is going to mass with Simon. They’ve 
known each other for a very long time — 
since they were teenagers. They’ve shared 
a romantic interlude in Paris, only to part 
for years after. They’ve woken up in bed 
together this morning.

It’s both a notable and unexciting event, 

the sort that Eileen, nearing 30, clings to. 
The moment happens in her head more 
than in reality, in her heart. She watches 
this man she’s loved for some time now 
sing his praises to someone he’s never 
met, joined by the chorus of believers. She 
watches him pray. He kisses her on the 
cheek, and they say goodbye. In an email 
to her friend Alice, Eileen wonders, “Do 
I resent him for liking the concept of God 
more than he likes me?”

Alice is far from her friends in Dublin. 

She’s chosen to rent a house in the Irish 
countryside after a stint in a psychiatric 
hospital. She’s not working. She’s not 
writing a new novel, which is what she 
usually does in these private spaces far 
from the world. She has plenty of money, 
no car, no interest in resuming her old life in 
the city. Soon she meets a man named Felix 
and brings him along on a publicity tour 
in Rome for her last novel. They sleep in 
separate bedrooms for the first few nights.

In an email to Eileen, Alice asks, “But 

what would it be like to form a relationship 
with no preordained shape of any kind? 
Just to pour the water out and let it fall. I 
suppose it would take no shape, and run off 
in all directions.”

“Beautiful World, Where Are You,” the 

third novel by acclaimed Irish author Sally 
Rooney, is not “Normal People.” For Alice 
and Eileen, years have passed since the 
clarity and confusion of youthful romance. 
They believe themselves to be passed that 
stage of thrilling uncertainty. They’re in 
their late 20s; life should be happening by 
now, settled in some way, meaningful in 
some way. It’s not. Is the meaning still to 
come, or has the moment passed?

That touch of adolescent excitement, 

which Rooney played to perfection in 
“Normal People,” is used sparingly in 
“Beautiful World.” Alice and Eileen debate 
whether they should be thrilled by their 
lives, but they don’t often feel thrilled. 
In their email correspondence, which 
runs through the spine of the novel, they 
discuss looming topics in distant regard to 

themselves — the bleak hum of capitalism; 
the tepid reality of one’s career; the goes-
both-ways struggle of friendship and love. 
These are not new topics for Rooney, but 
they’re renewed, reworked for characters 
settling into the dire prospect that life lasts 
longer than 20 or so years. 

But the spirit of Rooney’s unintrusive 

narration is as stunning as ever: “Driving 
back that night, the crescent moon 
lopsided and golden like a lifted saucer of 
champagne, the top buttons of her blouse 
were undone, she put her hand inside, 
touching her breastbone, they were talking 
about children, she had never wanted any 
before, but lately she wondered…” It doesn’t 
matter which character this is — you know 
them at once. You know where they are, 
what they want, what they think they 
want.

Rooney is unmatched in her style, in the 

immersive draw of her prose. She doesn’t 
use quotation marks. She doesn’t stunt a 
lucid clause by binding it to a full sentence. 
In “Normal People,” this feeling of presence 
sometimes became a grotesque thing, a 
stunning intensity. How many conflicts 
could have been resolved if Marianne and 
Connell chose to speak their minds?

But in “Beautiful World,” we are less 

often challenged to criticize than to 
concord in silence. These lives are not 
so simple, so young, so defined by the 
question of whether to speak or not to 
speak. Simon and Eileen’s connection is not 
new, it’s known: “And their phone calls, the 
messages they wrote to one another, their 
jealousies, the years of looks, suppressed 
smiles, their dictionary of little touches … 
This much was in their eyes and passed 
between them.”

And here we are with another story 

about knowing someone, being known by 
someone. We find ourselves once more 
treading in that deep water, only now we’re 
further from the shore:

“I just want everything to be like it was, 

Eileen said. And for us to be young again 
and live near each other, and nothing to 
be different. Alice was smiling sadly. But if 
things are different, can we still be friends? 
she asked … Crescent moon hanging low 
over the dark water. Tide returning now 
with a faint repeating rush over the sand. 
Another place, another time.”

Readers will be initially disappointed to 

hear that Rooney hasn’t written another 
“Normal People.” She’s written something 
better: an honest account of the motion of 
life, the march forward, the dissolution of 
pride and self-assurance.

Sandra Oh in a frumpy coat with 

her wonderfully curly hair puffed up 
is Hollywood catnip. I don’t know why 
Oh can never have a well-fitted trench, 
but she’s legally prohibited. The more 
functional and disheveled the coat, the 
better.

The industry trend holds true as 

Sandra Oh dons a lovely Lands’ End 
toggle wool jacket in “The Chair,” a 
comedy-drama set at a fictional Ivy 
League school. 

Debilitatingly funny and touching, 

“The 
Chair” 
essentializes 
higher 

education: 
overworked 
teacher’s 

assistants, anxious students, professors 
in crisis, the politics of tenure. The 
show lovingly documents the current 
state of academia through the story 
of one recently promoted department 
chair. 

Ji-Yoon 
(Sandra 
Oh, 
“Grey’s 

Anatomy”) 
enters 
as 
the 
English 

department is in decline. Enrollment 
is down, and the department’s aging 
professors can’t relate to or retain 
students. Gifted a desk plate that is 
endearingly inscribed with “fucker in 
charge of you fucking fucks,” Ji-Yoon is 

tasked with whipping the department 
into shape.

However, 
Ji-Yoon 
is 
first 
and 

foremost an educator, and not equipped 
to spar with administration politically. 
When upper management demands she 
get three older professors to resign, 
Ji-Yoon scrambles to modernize the 
professors’ syllabi. But her efforts lead 
to more confusion and unhappy peers.

At home, Ji-Yoon lives alone with 

her adopted daughter Juju (Everly 
Carganilla, “Yes Day”). Scenes with 
Juju anchor the series and provide a 
much-needed relief from wood-paneled 
offices. But the domestic scenes do more 
than contrast the elite, academic setting. 
Instead, home scenes substantiate the 
show’s ultimate thesis about being 
overwhelmed. Through interweaving 
the personal and the professional, 
“The Chair” understands Ji-Yoon as a 
multifaceted individual: a busy mother, 
a daughter, an employee and a friend.

Ji-Yoon often has to drop her 

daughter off at her elderly Korean 
father’s house. The interplay between 
Juju, Ji-Yoon and her grandfather 
Habi (Ji-Yong Lee, “Righteous Ties”) 
is absolutely fantastic and wholesome. 
Some of the funniest and most touching 
moments 
feature 
Juju, 
hilarious 

and 
frighteningly 
self-composed, 

contrasted with Habi and his constant 
bewilderment. Habi easily makes the 
list of top five television grandparents. 
Characters like Juju and Habi justify 
The Atlantic heralding “The Chair” as 
“Netflix’s best drama in years.”

But in the end, overcommitted and 

spread too thin, Ji-Yoon finds herself 
constantly unprepared to show up in 
a satisfactory way for the people she 
cares about.

And that’s the show. “The Chair” 

is about professional disappointment: 
negotiating wins and losses, taking 
responsibility for thoughtlessness. But 
unlike other workplace TV shows that 
glorify the grind and hard work, “The 
Chair” presents a startlingly simple 
solution to the impossible Gordian knot 
of professional obligation and personal 
responsibility: quit.

No one person has all the hours in the 

day to be a leader, an attentive mother, a 
good friend and a teacher. Throughout 
the series, no matter how much harder 
Ji-Yoon tries, and despite her brilliance 
and her willingness to compromise, the 
reality is that Ji-Yoon is unhappy trying 
to fulfill her obligations. 

The show’s thesis is bolstered by 

its lucid understanding of academia’s 
contradictions. One might adore the cold 
snap of winter and trekking across a quad 

immersed in literature, but no gamely 
exploration of Chaucer with a passionate 
professor can paste over students’ keen 
awareness of how wrong and broken the 
world is. The show resists the urge to 
make ivory tower politics seem absurd 
or the result of “snowflake undergrads” 
in need of “reality checks.”

How relevant is an English degree 

when the California state forests 
are 
burning? 
How 
can 
college 

campuses serve as both a vanguard 

of liberalism and theoretical thought 
while simultaneously being capitalist 
institutions that invest in Big Oil? 

The conflicts Ji-Yoon faces are all 

outgrowths of the turbulent present 
and higher education’s contradictions. 
“The 
Chair” 
doesn’t 
reconcile 
or 

directly respond to these questions, but 
instead validates them as queries. In a 
true collegiate fashion, the show says: 
“Great question, does anyone else have 
thoughts?”

 
“He’s All That” is a meta-exploration 

of what it means to be and stay famous. 
Though the film is almost an exact 
replica of the ’90s classic “She’s All 
That,” it fails to romanticize the teen 
experience in the same way.

The modern update of the film stars 

TikTok personality Addison Rae (“Spy 
Cat”) as Padgett Sawyer, this century’s 
Zack Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr., “Scooby-
Doo”). She’s a Southern California-
based teen influencer whose social 
status is in peril when she loses her cool 

on Instagram Live after walking in on 
her cheating boyfriend. She loses her 
sponsorship, watches her follower count 
plummet and decides that the only 
logical solution is to bet that she can 
make a certified “dork” named Cameron 
Kweller (Tanner Buchanan, “Chance”), 
the next prom king.

It’s a classic story with a classic 

solution and, inevitably, Padgett and 
Cameron develop feelings for each 
other. The antics that bring Padgett 
and her pet project together are sweet 
— they scoop poop together, reveal 
inane secrets (like how Padgett’s mom 
is a nurse or that Cameron likes to take 
pictures) and do all the things teens do 

when falling in love in an hour and a half 
on our computer screens. While “He’s 
All That” is not a story for the ages, Rae 
is a surprisingly good actress, offering 
a level of sincerity and emotion that we 
don’t often see in the TikTok videos the 
star is famous for.

Predictably, this film is interesting 

only to the extent that it can be 
compared to the original. For instance, 
the fact that a social media landscape 
even exists in “He’s All That” drastically 
changes the dynamics of the plot. The 
stakes are arguably higher for Padgett 
than they were for Zack. While Zack’s 
reputation as cool guy du jour in the 
original is under the watchful eye of 
maybe three thousand people, four if 
we’re being generous, Padgett’s fall 
from glory is seen by between eight 
hundred thousand and nine hundred 
thousand people and a critical corporate 
representative. “The bet,” for Zack, is a 
way to get his mind off the blonde who 
broke his heart. For Padgett, it’s the 
difference between securing her college 
tuition or drowning in student debt.

No matter how funny it is that they 

made Cameron a horse-boy instead 
of a falafel-slinger, Netflix can’t just 
let a movie be a movie. The streaming 
company’s favorite thing to do is 
make sure its characters have a moral 
awakening — “He’s All That” is no 
different. The issue here, however, is 
that there is simply no way to make a 
movie starring influencers without 
inadvertently 
insulting 
the 
very 

thing that got them the part in the 
first place. Early in their friendship, 
Cameron criticizes Padgett’s need 
to document everything in her life, 
allowing Netflix to eventually drive 
home the tired message that what 
we see on social media is not the full 
picture.

While this lesson is positive enough, 

it’s marred by the fact that Addison 
Rae is an influencer herself and on a 
much larger scale than her character. 
She has no credits to her name beyond 
“A-list 
TikToker” 
and 
“Kourtney 

Kardashian’s friend.” She boasts 83.5 
million followers on TikTok and close to 
40 million on Instagram. What’s more, 
Rae was at the center of a social media 
cheating scandal with YouTuber Bryce 
Hall that had people taking sides and 
making catchy hashtags in the same 
way they did for Padgett after her messy 
public breakup.

But though these similarities make 

it hard to take Netflix’s high-minded 
scheming seriously, Addison Rae is a 
different story. As one of her first forays 
into a more “traditional” Hollywood 
career, “He’s All That” establishes the 
TikToker as a viable option for other 
films in the future, bringing with her 
a stable following for which studio 
executives will probably salivate. So, 
while I doubt many of us have plans 
to watch this film as religiously as the 
original, I also won’t be surprised if 
Addison Rae becomes a Netflix cast 
staple. 

I was obsessed with the true and false binary for 

a very brief period in the summer of 2019. These 
binary statements meant everything when coding 
my research on a computer-generated analysis of 
Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics (I know that’s a little 
too theatre kid, but bear with me). Knowing how to 
categorize words in a productive way felt impossible 
without using something so strict as a true-and-
false parameter. 

Coding is not easy, especially when it comes to 

artificial intelligence. In a world of tech secrecy, 
using a binary doesn’t cut it. Binaries don’t work 
on complex modern problems. There is a spectrum 
of solutions needed to give AI the chance to shine. 
With restrictive AI practices, there is a world of gray 
that is hard to clear out.

However, “Stephanie Dinkins: On Love and Data” 

is anything but just gray. It’s neon yellow, deep violet 
and a spectrum of what AI is here and now.

At the School of Art & Design Stamps Gallery 

downtown, “Stephanie Dinkins: On Love and 
Data,” curated by Gallery Director Srimoyee Mitra, 
celebrates Dinkins’s manifesto of “Afro-now-ism”: 
an active statement for what art and tech should be 
against systemic oppression. 

Mitra pulls from Dinkins’s most recent works to 

create a place where visitors can experience AI that 
fosters community and generational storytelling.

One of the most technically complex exhibits 

comes in the form of a dialogue. “Conversations 
with Bina48: Fragments 7, 6, 5, 2” is the recorded 
in-person, 
face-to-face 
interaction 
between 

Stephanie Dinkins and advanced social robot Bina48 
(short for “Breakthrough Intelligence via Neural 
Architecture”). The four clips of conversations last 
about a minute each — yet, as you listen, you can 
hear the repetitive nature of AI emulating personal 
thought. They touch on love, life and Bina herself, 
who is perhaps the only robot who is a Black woman. 

Bina speaks with complex, long sets of 

statements. She circles around a point, shading it 
into existence rather than painting it all at once. 
If not for the stark image of Dinkins and Bina’s 
faces inches from touching, I might not have felt 
the intimate nature of their connection. Their 
proximity was magnetic, seeing the subtlety of 
Dinkins compared to the more simulated nature of 
Bina’s delivery. 

This piece, like most in the exhibit, is in that 

exciting space of ongoing: not quite final, ever-
changing. The nature of AI makes projects hard 
to complete — how can they be finished, when AI 
is evolving every second? Changing, adapting and 
radicalizing new ways to dismantle and connect; if 
anything, this constant growth gives the collection 
a sense of unity. Everything’s in action. Sensors, 
speakers and AI harmonize to create a holistic 
image of technology that electrifies.

“Secret Garden” is the culmination of this 

action. An immersive installation of projectors 
and speakers illustrates three generations of Black 
women’s power and their stories. The use of space 
and projection breathes life into the space. A 
woman is seen ducking to the sides of a corner, and 
the projected background is composed of flora that 
highlights the space the women hold together. It 
perfectly embodies the women’s stories — stories 
of resilience and power in the face of generational 
inequality. 

Binaries are stupid. When it comes time to create 

content, whether coded or not, I shouldn’t depend 
on something so limited. It’s time to think about 
how tech can bring power to communities that have 
often been hurt by coding practices. “Stephanie 
Dinkins: On Love and Data” shows how and what 
AI should be.

Open at the Stamps Gallery until Oct. 23, it is 

worth seeing Dinkins in a league of her own.

6 — Wednesday, September 8, 2021 

With the return of school comes heavy 

books, dense nonfiction and endless essays. 
To balance the hefty academic reading, the 
Daily’s Book Review writers have compiled 
a list of six must-reads for the back-to-
school season. Some are summer releases 
that might’ve slipped under your radar, 
while others have been on your to-read list 
for years. These books are exciting, sharp 
and fast-paced: From celebrity memoirs to 
gruesome thrillers, the recommendations are 
perfect to combat the incoming fall semester 
fatigue and keep you reading for pleasure.

‘A Deadly Education’ by Naomi Novik
Wonderfully funny and sharp, Novik’s 

novel is a post-Harry Potter fantasy 
response to “what if (insert all-powerful, 
big bad villain type here) grew up in a 
loving hippie household” and then went to 
a dangerous wizard school. The concept 
is ridiculous, but the novel works because 
it doesn’t take itself too seriously; at the 
same time, Novik’s novel is more than 
an experimental Harry Potter clone. “A 
Deadly Education” boasts a compelling cast 
of characters and brilliant world-building, 
and reveals Novik’s deep understanding 
of fantasy conventions. Some pop culture 
familiarity will help readers catch some of 
the more tongue-in-cheek references, but 
the novel’s charm holds even without it.

‘Interior Chinatown’ by Charles Yu
An intellectual successor to Viet Thanh 

Nguyen’s “The Sympathizer,” “Interior 
Chinatown” prods at what it means to pass 
through life unseen, reduced to tropes 
and epitaphs. Yu’s main character is an 
actor playing “Generic Asian Man,” but he 
aspires to be “Kung-Fu Guy.” Each epitaph 
and character comes with a predetermined 
plot and role. Primarily dialogue and 
formatted as a script, the novel delves 
into all the hot topics in Asian-American 
discourse: marginalization, the perpetual 
foreigner syndrome, the fetishization of 
Asian women. However, what sets the 

novel apart is its keen understanding of 
internalized racism and the bounds of self-
rationalization.

‘Greenlights’ 
by 
Matthew 

McConaughey

Matthew McConaughey’s “Greenlights” 

captures both the dramatic exhilaration 
of a celebrity memoir and the sincerity 
of a philosophical work of nonfiction. He 
reflects on his 50 years of life, starting 
with the tale of his family and his 
boyhood growing up in Texas. It’s fast-
paced, hilarious and authentic all at once. 
McConaughey’s humor is perhaps the 
book’s greatest captivator — the audiobook 
does the book greater justice with 
McConaughey’s 
spontaneous 
laughter 

and gasps, making the book an experience 
rather than a simple read. His easy 
Southern accent provides an additional 
layer of warmth to his genuineness which 
wraps the reader in an intimate recollection 
of his past: memories from his first gigs, 
travels to rivers he swam in, dreams and 
rites of passages he failed and fulfilled. It’s 
the kind of book you read twice: First, to 
laugh and listen; second, to learn. 

— Lilly Pearce, Daily Book Review Editor

‘One Last Stop’ by Casey McQuiston
The New York Times best-selling 

author Casey McQuiston’s “One Last 
Stop” is a contemporary queer romance 
set in New York with an interesting twist. 
It begins with August, a 20-something 
transfer student, fleeing her mother and 
her obsession with her brother’s cold case. 
August is a self-proclaimed loner but finds 
it difficult to fight her solitary tendencies 
when she starts to fall for the girl on the 
train, Jane Su. The problem is that Jane 
can’t get off the subway, nor can she 
remember how long she’s been on it. With 
the help of her roommates, August tries to 
solve the mystery and help Jane — but it 
might mean that saving her means they’ll 
never see each other again. McQuiston 
does a wonderful job balancing the 
fantastical elements of unsolved mysteries 
with the realistic sentiments of romance 
and friendship, making “One Last Stop” a 
must-read.

‘Goodbye, Again: Essays, Reflections, 

and Illustrations’ by Jonny Sun

Throughout 
Sun’s 
debut 
essay 

collection, plants pop up repeatedly: 
Their resilience is described in “Cactus,” 
their struggle for stimulation is detailed 
in “Pothos” and their sensitive nature is 
profiled in “Air Plant.” In “Succulent,” Sun 
writes, “Never water a succulent to try to 
get it to grow faster. It will not grow faster. 
You will drown its roots and the roots will 
rot and then the plant will die.” It’s a line 
I’ve been thinking of often. Plants often 
represent the self, and this essay collection 
is no exception. Sun describes his previous 
struggles with self-preservation while 
describing plants with care. Ultimately, 
“Goodbye, Again” sneaks up on you. It 
doesn’t make any large promises, and 
maybe that’s part of its charm. Sun 
reflects on the mundane, offering up a 
carefully-guarded piece of himself. Don’t 
tear through the book like I did (the first 
time); Sun’s labor of love deserves to be 
savored in tender, comforting chunks. 

In “Peperomia,” Sun writes of a rebirth: 
“Over time, with a little bit of watering a 
few times a week, a tiny sprout grew, with 
two tiny, fragile leaves reaching up. And 
now something else is growing, a new 
plant, in the same spot as my first plant. 
Like some sort of rebirth.” “Goodbye, 
Again” is Sun’s unmissable transition into 
an essayist.

‘Gone Girl’ by Gillian Flynn
I’m not sure if I read Gillian Flynn’s 

“Gone Girl” the way it was intended to 
be read. Don’t get me wrong, I love the 
concept of the death of the author — in fact, 
one of my favorite aspects of literature is 
its allowance for observers to take away 
meanings that are radically different from 
the author’s intentions. But I’ve read some 
interviews by Flynn, and the themes I 
pulled from the novel were clearly not 
intentional on her part. Yet that’s what 
makes “Gone Girl” so exhilarating for me. 
This psychological thriller follows Nick 

Dunne, a suspect in the disappearance 
and presumed murder of his wife, Amy. 
Without spoiling anything, there comes 
a point in the novel when you’re clearly 
supposed to feel bad for Nick — many 
people I’ve talked to can vouch for this 
— but I never did. But, in all honesty, this 
made the novel all the more captivating, 
because it was so fleshed out that it took 
on a life of its own, independent of Flynn’s 
imagination. Flynn’s ability to write 
complex and morally dubious characters 
and build tension by contrasting Nick 
and Amy’s perspectives resulted in 
an explosive novel I finished in one 
sitting. And, in spite of how delightfully 
tangled the characters’ schemes and 
webs become, Flynn manages to craft 
the perfect ending, so uniquely hopeless 
yet appropriate that it reminds me of 
masterpieces such as Jean-Paul Sartre’s 
play “No Exit.” Needless to say, my 
experience reading this novel will stay 
with me for a long time.

— Tate LaFrenier, Daily Arts Writer

“Annette” tries to throw the 

audience off from the outset. 
Over a blank screen, a voice 
tells the audience that noise of 
any kind, including breathing, 
will not be tolerated during the 
film. This transitions right into 
the opening number, asking 
the audience for permission to 
start the film while introducing 
the main characters. It’s an 
opening that will either have 
you immediately hooked or 
rolling your eyes and looking 
for the exits. 

The film is not afraid to take 

bold risks, and once it has you 
in its grasp, it refuses to let go.

“Annette” 
follows 
the 

marriage 
of 
comedian 

Henry 
McHenry 
(Adam 

Driver, 
“Marriage 
Story”) 

and 
opera 
singer 
Ann 

Defrasnoux (Marion Cotillard, 
“Inception”). These professions 
perfectly convey the film’s 
tone with the combination of 
the sadistic, dark comedy of a 
shock comedian and the big, 
emotional melodrama of an 
opera singer. The couple has a 
child named Annette, portrayed 
by a wooden puppet, the center 
of tension between Henry and 
Ann. By making Annette a 
puppet, the filmmakers avoid 
gambling on the performance of 
a child actor, while enhancing 
the themes of Henry’s control 
in all domains of life.

Director Leos Carax (“Holy 

Motors”) 
bombards 
the 

audience 
with 
unexpected 

twists, yet almost none of 
them would work without the 
completely committed central 
performances of Driver and 
Cotillard. It doesn’t matter 
what 
kind 
of 
ridiculous 

nonsense Carax asks them to 
do in a given scene; both actors 
are fully on board and give 
everything they have to get 
earn the emotional investment 
of viewers.

Driver delivers one of the 

best 
performances 
of 
his 

already illustrious career as he 
compels you to be on the side 
of a truly despicable man. The 
physicality of his performance, 
aided by his tall frame and full 
use of his remarkable skill as an 
actor, captivates the audience. 
During 
the 
scenes 
where 

Henry is performing stand-up, 
Driver expertly navigates the 
conflict with both the crowds 
at his shows and himself, and he 
perfectly portrays the character 
losing his mind.

As expected from a film 

that swings for the fences 
almost every second of its 
141-minute 
runtime, 
some 

choices strike out. The songs 
are surprisingly weak for a 
musical, and while they work 
fine within the context of the 
film, they aren’t going to be 
stuck in your head for weeks 
after hearing them.

The film also drags on a bit 

in the second half. A new plot 
development at the midpoint 
means it takes time to ramp up 
a new conflict, killing the film’s 
existing momentum. Once the 
new tension between Henry 
and his daughter is developed, 
“Annette” once again becomes 
entirely engrossing, but the 
tedium may lose viewers who 
weren’t totally sold by the film 
from the start.

“Annette” 
has 
been 
a 

polarizing film since it opened 
the Cannes Film Festival back 
in July, which isn’t unexpected 
given the outlandish choices the 
film makes. However, these are 
exactly the kinds of films that 
make the medium so wonderful. 
It’s a film that doesn’t play it 
safe and isn’t concerned about 
crashing and burning. It’s a film 
that, if enough people were to 
see it, should spark fascinating 
discussions for months, if not 
years.

Not all of it works, but 

“Annette” is one of the best 
films of the year so far precisely 
because not all of it works. It 
makes for a far more interesting 
and 
invigorating 
experience 

than something that aims lower 
and succeeds.

‘Annette’ is an 

audacious, chaotic, 
mesmerizing tragedy

I. Why I Write

Writing has always been my way 

of coping with the world around me. 
When I feel something, I pull up my 
Notes application and write as much 
as I can manage coherently. But, I have 
kept these writings to myself. In my 
published writing, I have always limited 
myself to comfortable topics, which 
often means other people’s experiences 
and feelings. I want to challenge that. 
In fear of people actually knowing my 
opinions, I have always kept them to 
myself. This is ironic because I usually 
admire authors whose work is rooted 
in authenticity and honesty, so I have 
decided to try to honor that in my work 
moving forward.

The first step was to approach 

my 
writing 
from 
a 
vulnerable 

standpoint. I wanted to write about 
the experiences this past year that had 
made me the most uncomfortable and 
still felt raw. It was important for me 
to write about these situations because 
it allowed me to confront them and 
explore new topics. The second step 
was to incorporate my Notes. In the 
following poems and stories, there 
are fragments of Notes from where I 
drew inspiration. I was influenced to 
start incorporating some of these raw 
thoughts into my work when I read 
Catherine Lacey for a class. Though 
she is not my favorite author, I am 
really impressed by the raw emotion 
she captures in her work. During 
quarantine, I was also inspired by a 
book I read, “Normal People” by Sally 
Rooney. In the book, her descriptions 
of intimacy between the two main 
characters made me consider how I 
can portray intimacy inspired by my 
previous relationships. These two 
authors really grounded me on the 
journey I went on in my writing and 
provided me inspiration when I was 
severely lacking some. 

This work aims at capturing my 

emotional state during a weird period of 
my life. In the past year, I found myself 
dealing with feelings of inadequacy in 
both my romantic life and my family 
life. Not only did I not feel like I am 
enough for other people, but I didn’t 
feel enough for myself. 

I imagine many people feel this way 

during transitional periods of their 
life. I was really driven by these 
emotions when writing this collection 
because I wanted to finally confront 
it. I wanted to understand the times 
where I felt like I could not compare 
to someone else or that I wasn’t worth 
fighting for.

***

II. Selfish
 

i kissed my world
and i told him
“love me”
forgetting our lovers or children
what i want is to be held by my world
i know if I can’t have what I want
i want it more
i climb, struggle, fight
i reach my understanding world
and squeeze him

III. Ghost
 

A hand presses against my thigh
Begging- to go higher 
Calloused hands 
 tell me a story 
 last year 
December, 
 when she broke your heart 
Even though you gave everything 
 you were still 
Fighting till your knuckles bled 
 but soon you were forgotten 
Gone for a while 
 but I was still painfully aware 
 of you 
Hearts pounding, your breathing 
 a rough staccato 
“I want you,” you say 
Just barely a stutter 
Kiss me, Kiss me 
Love me, Love me 
Me,
Not her, never her 
Open your eyes 
Please see me
Quiet except for
 the rustle of clothes
Regret, so heavy, screaming at you
She’s here
There,
 filling the space between
Us,
Veiled
 in each murmur, each 
touch, 

 each kiss
Where you picture your
X, leaving me thinking
Yearning to be enough
Zelotypia- excessive jealous

IV. But 
You Made Me This Way

 

The match is burning and I can’t stop it 
Orange embers paint shadowy figures 
of the dark
Gray tendrils fight to rise against the sky
You caress my palm against the heat

Dark figures shadows orange embers
There’s intimacy in that
You force my palm against the heat
One finger at a time, you mold me in 
your image
Where is the intimacy in that?
In creating a monster out of a woman
You molded me in your violent image
And cursed the burns inflicted
In creating a phoenix out of a woman
Gray tendrils overcome the sky
And embrace the burns inflicted
The match is burnt and I-

V. An Empty House

This house is not a home. Walls 
peeling, a bucket of paint primer left 
to its own devices, half-written plans 
scattered across the floor drift with 
the wind from the half-open window 
and it’s all empty

This house is not their home. Rats eat 
at the peeling walls, paint primer opens 
on its side, the wind pushes the solution 
to slowly cover the half-written plans 
as the bucket is almost empty

This house is no longer a home. Vines 
grow with its age, covering rat eaten 
wallpaper, the floor decorated with rat 
prints and paint and yellowing half-
written plans that don’t make it look 
empty

This house is our home. Wallpaper 
lovingly placed against paint primer, 
a bucket of paint, which acts as a stool 
as our son writes the plans for his 
room that was once empty

***

VI. Of Family

Vivid color encompasses the darkened 
landscape. Green sways, fighting 
to stand strong against the wind. A 
gentle rustle whispers among the 
plants that create the softest sound. 
In the mountains, there is no light 
pollution, no smog, no noise. There is 
nothing except for this and the soft 
breaths of a family gazing up.The dark 
blue sea in the sky is endless, where 
little islands shine in a kaleidoscope of 
light. Once the eye has adjusted to the 
dark, four figures become distinct.

“This was the same place your 
grandfather decided to leave the island. 
He saw the stars and knew there was a 
life for his future beyond this pueblo. 
La familia regalaron todo a él. Y él regaló 
su vida por nosotros.”

Father is tall, a formidable figure that 
lacks fear and affection, but whenever 
he talks about his own father, there 
is a certain kindness to his voice that 
he lacks when speaking to his three 
children. The eldest, Hermana, listens 
attentively. Her gangly limbs hang 
disproportionately to one another, 
having hit that awkward period of 
growth where she is in constant flux. 
She repeatsw her father’s Spanish in 
her head, rolling the words around, 
willing them to make sense.

“Dad, what does regalo mean?”

Her face burns, flooding with shame. 
She should know this.

“His family gave him their entire 
savings. Every single one of them 
sacrificed what they had earned for 
him to build a future for everyone. 
Abuelito had to take their gift and leave 
them for the future. He didn’t stop 
when he missed his home. He didn’t 
stop when home missed him. He didn’t 
stop when his father died. He stopped 
once he succeeded. He ran back home 
to what was left of his family and gave 
them the future he had fought for.”

Thump

“Papi, he hit me!”

The littlest one, Chiquita, clutches her 
arm in pain, a big tear trickling down 
her cheek. She shoves the slightly 
taller boy beside her. Hermano yelps, 
echoing across the green. Their father 
continues to look at the stars.

–

She is no longer an imbalance of limbs. 
As years pass, the awkwardness of 
Hermana’s youth shaped itself into a 
reflection of her grandmother. She sees 
her grandmother’s hair in the mirror 
as she brushes out her own thick, curly 
hair into flat, black terrain. This was 
her first day of graduate school, another 
step on her path to her own individual 
success. On her own. Not on the back of 
her grandfather’s legacy but of her own 
work. Of her own effort. She reminds 
herself of this as she walks into her first 
classroom. Especially when she tells her 
students a fake last name, denying her 
family in the process. The same feeling 
she had on that starry night blossoms 
fiercely within her, flushing her face 
with shame.

Tears swell in her eyes as she inhales. 
Chiquita is spellbound by the colors 
around her. Stark red and gold lay 
flush against the grey concrete. Bodies 
thrash against the music, which is 
primarily bass and conversations that 
turn into a roar.

“It’s beautiful,” she whispers to herself. 
She’s seeing double as the colors begin 
to blur into one another. She lays 
down on the floor. Cool metal presses 
against her back. There are stars in the 
industrial ceiling, ones only she can 
see. She makes out the constellations, 
reaching out to touch one.

From Hermano

1:39 AM: What r u doing? We talked 
about this NO more

If she just took another hit, then she 
could get there, to abuelito’s stars.

1:50 AM: U are wasting ur life away

Burning in her throat, she attempts to 
get off the club floor. “Great party,” a 
man in a grey mask says as he passes. 
She thinks she says thanks before 
everything grew too hazy and

2:00 AM: This is what ur going to do 
with what abuelito left u

–

The light from his Klipsk personal 
office unit, purchased from IKEA, 
one in rows and rows of offices. Pain 
radiates between each knuckle, a 
familiar feeling of fatigue roots itself 
within him. Hermano stares at the 
door, wondering if it is time to go home. 
His grandfather, in the photo, stares 
back at him from his desk.

“Why don’t you work harder,” his 
grandfather’s brown eyes, so similar 
to his own, mock him. “When I was 
your age, I had immigrated here with a 
family of four and worked till the skin 
on my hands se rompieron y tu quieres 
ir ahora?” His grandfather’s voice 
manifested from his own imagination.

“I’m trying,” he responds into the 
empty air. It would never be enough. 
The sacrifices that he makes will never 
be equivalent to his grandfather’s. 
Despite his hands’ protest, the brother 
continues to work into the long night.

–

They never have nights like this 
anymore. Green encompassed the 
landscape; the “Variegata” had taken 
over all the available garden space 
in Abuelito’s house. On the hill, his 
home stands far away from the light of 
the town. The air is different up here. 
Clean. The siblings exhale. Identical 
brown eyes search one another for 
relief. Reuniting is never a simple 
reflex; sentences start and are left 
unfinished. Pauses are a near constant. 
But, despite the difficulty, side by 
side, they could exist. No thoughts of 
accomplishment, of work, of legacy, 
only the warmth of being embraced by 
family, of acceptance.

L

ast 
November 
saw 
the 

continuation 
of 
a 
local 

tradition in Rochester, N.Y., 

where hundreds of women adorned 
the grave of Susan B. Anthony with 
their “I Voted” stickers. The act 
is a nod to the role she played in 
earning women the right to vote. 
But the tradition glosses over a 
major problem with the history of 
the women’s suffrage movement: 
It was done almost entirely for the 
benefit of white women. Anthony 
was willing to denigrate Black men 
to advance white women’s suffrage. 
Her contemporary Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton was explicitly racist, and 
both women left the work of Black 
activists out of their narrative of early 
feminism. The prioritization of white 
women at the expense of people 
of color dominated mainstream 
feminism during the 20th century 
and still does today. This branch 
of advocacy has become a distinct 
form of “feminism” known as white 
feminism, and has been rightly 
criticized and called out.

However, I’m not writing today 

to call out Anthony or Stanton or to 
critique white feminism (although 
you should definitely spend time 
reading pieces that do). Rather, 
I’m using the feminist movement’s 
struggle with white feminism as a 
framework of comparison for another 
advocacy movement that’s struggling 
severely with pervasive whiteness in 
its mainstream: veganism.

That very word may have made 

you cringe. Vegans aren’t winning 
any popularity contests anytime 
soon, 
and 
lots 
of 
stereotypes 

surround the movement, one of them 
being that of whiteness. Perhaps the 
image conjured in your mind when 
you think of a vegan is a white person 
decked out in Lululemon and non-
leather Birkenstocks toting a Whole 
Foods bag filled with cashews and 
quinoa. Maybe, more negatively, you 
also thought of this person speaking 
down to others and demanding that 
everyone go vegan regardless of 
circumstance, while also refusing to 
acknowledge the privileges that allow 
them to have choice in their diets.

The prevalence of whiteness in 

mainstream veganism has made 
many want to reject the ideas of 
veganism entirely, claiming it’s a 
“gateway to white supremacy” or 
that it’s intrinsically racist, ableist 
and classist. White veganism is so 
damaging that many are outright 
dismissing 
a 
movement 
and 

philosophy which seeks to end the 
suffering and exploitation of billions 
of animals each year and which has 
“as far as is possible and practicable” 
built into its definition.

The 
relationship 
between 

veganism and white veganism is very 

similar to that between feminism and 
white feminism. Both movements 
have been and still are progressing 
through the work of people of color 
— work that has often gone unnoticed 
or uncredited. The white version of 
both movements is fundamentally 
opposed to the true goals of each 
movement, serving only white and 
often middle-class people at the 
expense of others, helping them 
benefit from oppressive systems 
rather 
than 
dismantling 
those 

systems entirely. White people who 
appropriate each movement refuse 
to acknowledge their own privileges 
and the constrained circumstances 
and choices others face that may 
limit their activism, contrasting with 
the intersectional approach both 
movements should be pursuing.

However, there is a dissimilarity 

between feminism and veganism 
in how their white counterparts 
have impacted their perception as 
a whole. While many acknowledge 
white feminism is a problem and 
it needs to be stopped, they still 
believe the fundamental purposes 
of feminism — to advance gender 
equity and human rights — are 
legitimate, and that feminism is still 
valid and important. But when it 
comes to veganism, its white form 
has given people license to dismiss 
it entirely. While this is frustrating, 
it’s partially on us; vegans have 
not done enough to quarantine or 
reject whiteness from veganism. 
However, I also think veganism’s 
detractors should genuinely reflect 
on their criticisms of veganism and 
evaluate if they may be motivated 
by their discomfort with veganism’s 
implications and goals.

On our end, vegans must root out 

whiteness from our practice and 
advocacy on both the individual 
and systemic levels. Unfollow and 
stop supporting influencers that 
perpetuate white veganism, such 
as sisters Ellen Fisher and Hannah 
McNeely or the somewhat infamous 
Freelee the Banana Girl, and make 
room in your feed for vegans of 
color like Jenné Claiborne, Joanne 
Molinaro and Nisha Vora, among 
many others. This doesn’t mean you 

can’t follow any vegans who are white, 
but make sure the white vegans you 
choose to support aren’t perpetuating 
white veganism and that your 
understanding of veganism is also 
informed by voices of color. Similarly, 
call out animal rights organizations 
that perpetuate the image of veganism 
as a “white thing” and demand they 
make space for diversity in veganism.

And this definitely doesn’t mean 

you shouldn’t be or become vegan 
or advocate for veganism if you’re 
white — I’m writing this as a white 
vegan. But you must make an effort 
to be educated on and cognizant 
of how pervasive whiteness is in 
mainstream veganism, in order to 
avoid perpetuating white veganism 
and to ensure your advocacy is 
intersectional. This also entails 
rejecting 
plant-based 
capitalism 

and acknowledging that we will 
never end the oppression of humans 
and animals under an economic 
system based on exploitation. In the 
poignant and revolutionary words of 
Audre Lorde, “the master’s tools will 
never dismantle the master’s house.” 
This is true whether we’re talking 
about sexism and the patriarchy or 
speciesism and animal oppression.

White veganism is a problem. If 

vegan advocacy wants to end the 
oppression and advance the rights 
of animals, it needs to distinguish 
white veganism from veganism as a 
whole and reject it, much like many 
feminists have done with white 
feminism. Veganism has a problem 
with racism, but we can isolate 
and remove this appropriation of 
the movement and work to uphold 
intersectional veganism in a way that 
benefits all humans and animals.

As for non-vegans who still believe 

veganism should be rejected entirely 
due to mainstream prioritization of 
whiteness: Would you reject feminism 
entirely on the same grounds? If not, 
you may need to reconsider whether 
it’s really white veganism preventing 
you from supporting veganism, or if 
you’re unable to confront the reality 
and magnitude of animal exploitation 
at this time. But if you ever decide you 
are ready, veganism will have space 
for you, no matter who you are.

A

s far as I can remember, I’ve 
always enjoyed interacting 
and conversing with other 

people. Peers and mentors would tell 
me I had a “dynamic personality” 
that would help me later on in life. 
This must be a positive quality, I 
assumed, and I refused to give my 
social ability any more thought than 
that. 

In winter 2020, I elected to 

attend the University of Michigan. I 
immediately figured meeting people 
would be one of the easiest, most 
enjoyable aspects of freshman year. 
I was coming off the adrenaline 
high that was my senior year of high 
school, reassuring and providing me 
with newfound social confidence. 

Then 
everything 
changed. 

COVID-19 hit. Cases went up. Dorms 
shut down. 

One year later, I blinked and 

realized I had spent the entirety of 
my first year in college at the same 
desk, looking at the same view of my 
subdivision, as I had done for the past 
12 years. 

The hardest part was not seeing 

anyone for eight months. I woke 
up, got a glimpse of my classmates 
in a pixelated box, ate food, did 
homework and went to bed. If I had 
elected to go to campus in-person, 
perhaps this would not have been the 
case. I will never know. 

When I started my job this 

past summer on the staff of a local 
golf course, I quickly realized my 
new, 
once-unfathomable 
reality: 

I hadn’t socialized with anyone in 
eight months, let alone 14 soon-to-
be coworkers. Once I grasped the 
situation, the social rust began to 
show. It’s almost like I forgot how to 
do the very thing that helped me get 
to where I am today: talk. 

The first month or so at the golf 

course was rough. Talking to golfers, 
colleagues and the like, I stuttered, 
slurred words or — worst of all — 
would zone out in the middle of a 
one-on-one conversation. I began 
to stick to company lines instead of 
improvising original material. No 
golfer enjoys being fed the same three 
sentences from everyone on staff, but 
somehow that was all I could muster. 
I was completely lost. What the heck 
is going on?, I thought to myself. Am 

I okay? 

Frustrated and dumbfounded, I 

searched for answers. Chris Segrin, a 
scientist at the University of Arizona 
with an emphasis in interpersonal 
relationships, claims that “social 
skills are like athletic skills. If you 
don’t practice them for a long time, 
they atrophy.” Okay, I thought, but 
why does it still feel like it’s only 
me navigating this intrapersonal 
uncertainty? It turns out I wasn’t 
alone. According to a study conducted 
by Harvard University’s School of 
Education, 61% of young adults ages 
18-25 reported “miserable degrees 
of loneliness” during the pandemic. 
In all honesty, my post-quarantine 
social sluggishness was not only 
common, it was perfectly normal.

***
I’ve never given much thought 

to the introvert-extrovert debate, 
because I believe most people are 
a healthy blend of both. After the 
past year and a half, however, I’m 
wondering if we’ve all become 
introverts, with some of us trying to 
claw our way back to extroversion 
again.

*** Author’s Note: This article 

should be read with R.E.M.’s “It’s the 
End of the World As We Know It” 
playing in headphones. If that song is 
not available, Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t 
Start the Fire” is an author-approved 
substitute.
W

hile it’s been a terrible 
year and a half for 
almost everything, it’s 

been a great time for R.E.M.’s 1987 
hit single “It’s the End of the World 
As We Know It (And I Feel Fine).” 
The song has steadily crept back 
into our playlists, radio stations and 
general psyche during the past two 
years. Growing up, I used to listen 
to the song frequently and found its 
satirical, nihilistic tone to be quite 
comforting. In the aftermath of 9/11, 
living through the 2008 economic 
crash and the beginning of regular 
school shootings, it’s clear our 
generation was dealt a tough hand 
at a young age, a fact that has heavily 
shaped our lives. American stability 
has never been a comfort we could 
enjoy — even before the COVID-19 
pandemic — and is certainly not 
something I foresee us enjoying in 
the near future. 

As I’ve recently been listening 

to the song, the end of the chorus 
has stuck out to me. For those 
unfamiliar, the chorus: 

It’s the end of the world as we 

know it,

It’s the end of the world as we 

know it,

It’s the end of the world as we 

know it, and I feel fine.

The last time I listened to the 

song, that line in the chorus “and I 
feel fine” hit me like a sack of bricks. 
In many ways, it does feel like the 
world is ending, certainly as we 
know it. And I most certainly do not 
feel fine!

How 
do 
we 
individually 

process issues that so greatly 
affect the collective? From the 
ongoing pandemic to reports of 
the devastating effects of climate 
change; to the societal upheaval and 
fracturing we’ve witnessed from the 
steps of the Capitol Building to our 
own living rooms, it seems like the 
world is falling out from under us. I 

think these feelings of grief, despair, 
sadness and anger are natural, and 
we should accept and feel them 
when they arrive. However, we 
should not let them stifle our other 
emotions. 

I’ve found a few strategies that 

have helped me process living 
through this series of unfortunate 
events 
we 
find 
ourselves 
in; 

strategies that both allow me to 
be involved in creating solutions 
while also taking care of my mental 
health. Going forward, I urge you to 
consider these strategies for yourself 
or to at least begin to engage with 
some of these topics.

First and foremost, creating 

an intentional consumption, and 
lack thereof, of media surrounding 
overwhelming topics has been key in 
preventing me from spiraling when 
addressing such topics. Finding time 
to hold space for stillness or taking 
a step back from certain topics is 
crucial in preventing a given issue 
from 
becoming 
overwhelming. 

When things become overwhelming 
they can become all-consuming, 
where one may feel hyper-fixated or 
unable to focus or act upon anything 
else. Alternatively, they can become 
compartmentalized, 
where 
one 

refuses to engage with a topic to 
prevent further emotions when 
addressing it. Both these responses 
prevent us from feeling the natural 
range of human emotions that 
should accompany our lives and 
perspectives on these topics. 

A simple way to hold time for 

yourself is to segment time in your 
day to engage with a certain topic, like 
climate change or politics, therefore 
allowing you to engage with these 
critical issues thoughtfully. This 
provides you with space during 
the rest of the day to focus on other 
things, knowing you have addressed 
or will address those areas of concern. 
This promotes healthy reflection, 
action and engagement with these 
overwhelming topics. Other ways 
to help include adding filters to 
Instagram and Twitter accounts 
to limit the amount you consume 
regarding a certain topic while on 
the apps. Unexpected engagements 
with depressing articles can be 
incredibly demoralizing without 
producing any positive engagement 
or action.

Another strategy I’ve found, and 

one that is especially possible at the 
beginning of the school year, is to get 
involved with on-campus initiatives 
that 
can 
create 
local 
impact 

regarding topics of concern. While 
the doom and gloom surrounding 
a host of issues sometimes feel 
hopeless, getting involved on campus 
to make a local impact is incredibly 
important both for creating change 
and helping us feel the spectrum 
of feelings that accommodate our 
current situation. Being involved 
on campus in the work on topics 
like climate justice, racial justice, 
economic equality or sustainable 
living creates a sense of hope and 
purpose towards addressing those 
topics while simultaneously actually 
helping make change around them. 
So many wonderful groups exist 
on campus that are doing the work 
to engage and combat many of 
these seemingly insurmountable 
problems. 

A final strategy is to just do 

something else, anything else. I 
often found these doomsday-like 
topics (that are frankly our reality 
for the foreseeable future) could 
quite literally push me into a corner. 
Feeling trapped and hopeless, I spent 
much more time thinking about 
all the things I could and should be 
doing than doing any of it. While we 
try to ‘what-if’ ourselves to death 
on a host of topics in an unhealthy 
and unproductive manner, finding 
something that works to combat 
these overwhelming feelings is 
imperative to preserving our mental 
health and working to fight these 
tough topics. Go on a walk, have an 
impromptu dance party, call your 
grandma. Don’t think, just break the 
ice.

At the end of the day, we’re all 

navigating what R.E.M. would 
describe as “the end of the world 
as we know it.” While we live 
through it, work our best to fight 
against it and ultimately see where 
current times lead us, we shouldn’t 
always feel fine. The “end of the 
world as we know it” can be quite 
daunting, scary and bleak — we 
should embrace this reality with 
authenticity and care. As we do 
so, let’s do our best to laugh, smile, 
cry, love, grieve, work, rest and take 
care of ourselves along the way.

I

t is a wonderful month for 
infrastructure! On Aug. 10 this 
year, the U.S. Senate passed a 

$1 trillion infrastructure bill. Along 
with $39 billion for public transit and 
$65 billion for broadband, this bill 
would also streamline the federal 
environmental impact assessment 
process. This included codifying a 
Trump-era executive order intended 
to speed up certain federal projects, 
as well as amending how the federal 
government applies the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 

NEPA is the most influential piece 

of federal environmental policy in 
recent history. Former President 
Richard Nixon signed the NEPA into 
law in early 1970. Originally a piece 
of legislation meant to protect the 
environment, it has been perverted 
by proponents of a “not in my back 
yard” or NIMBY ideology to do the 
opposite. The actual text of the law is 
benign, merely requiring that federal 
agencies assess the environmental 
impacts of any projects that are 
undertaken by the government or that 
need a federal permit. Unfortunately, 
in the 50 years since the law’s 
enactment, the implementation of 
the act has spiraled into a web of 
obstruction and lawsuits that shocks 
many European regulators and 
planners alike. 

While environmental groups like 

Earthjustice and the NRDC have 
criticized the move to streamline 
NEPA, this was absolutely the right 
decision. Current applications of 
environmental regulations are in 
and of themselves environmentally 
harmful, as they are often the cause of 
the death, extreme delay and extreme 
cost for the sorts of projects that we 
need most desperately, such as high-
density housing or public transit. 

Is it hyperbolic of me to say that 

an environmental protection law is 
harming the environment? A little, 
but let’s look at the facts.

The United States is one of the 

most expensive countries to build 
infrastructure. According to the 
Niskanen 
Center, 
the 
average 

environmental 
impact 
statement 

takes around 4.5 years to complete. 
Regularly over 1,000 pages, these 
documents 
cost 
development 

entities, both in the public and private 
sectors, billions of dollars in delays. 
Running on average around 600 
pages, these documents have to be 
thorough because they are subjected 
to an odious legal gauntlet from 
homeowners associations and other 
aggrieved parties. 

But what does that mean in terms 

of how much extra cold hard cash is 
spent on projects? As Vox journalist 
Jerusalem 
Desmas 
reported, 
a 

recent New York City Second Avenue 
subway 
expansion 
project 
cost 

taxpayers $2.6 billion per mile. San 

Francisco’s Central Subway Project 
took $920 million, and the Los 
Angeles Metro’s D Line spent a cool 
$800 million per mile. 

A 
very 
similar 
project 
in 

Copenhagen? Practically free at 
$323 million per mile. In Italy and 
Spain, these types of projects can 
be as cheap as $160 million per mile. 
It is not out of the question to say 
that with European centralization 
of transportation authorities, we 
could get as much as 10 times the 
bang for our buck compared to the 
present day. 

This obstruction is deadly. Every 

public transit project delayed is 
another pedestrian killed by a 
motorist. Every day delayed is 
another thousand tons of carbon 
spit into the atmosphere by bulky 
SUVs and pickups. So yes, of course, 
we should pay attention to the 
environmental impact of action. 
But, we should also consider the 
environmental cost of inaction: 
the cost of continuing in our car-
centric, human-unfriendly method 
of development, continuing even 
when the laws of both capitalism and 
human nature tell us that we need to 
change.

The NEPA is still a largely 

beneficial 
bill, 
requiring 
the 

government to be deliberate in the 
actions they take and how they affect 
the environment. 

Congress is weakening the National 
Environmental Policy Act. That’s 

good for the environment.

LSA LECTURE

The last time Cade McNa-

mara took the field in Michigan 
Stadium, little went according to 
plan. 

Facing Penn State in his first 

collegiate start last November, 
McNamara finished just 12-of-
25 through the air for 91 yards 
before leaving the game early 
with a shoulder injury. Unable 
to muster any offense, Michigan 
slogged through a 10-point loss. 

Saturday told a different story. 
In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
2021 

season-opener, 
McNamara 

flourished, going 9-of-11 with 
136 passing yards and a pair of 
touchdowns, leading Michigan 
to a 47-14 victory. By the time he 
departed with 5:48 minutes left 
in the third quarter, the Wolver-
ines had a comfortable 26-point 
lead with McNamara having 
engineered 
four 
touchdown 

drives. 

“He moves our team,” Michi-

gan coach Jim Harbaugh said 
after the game. “All the drives 
he’s been in — we score points 
when he’s out there.”

Entering the season, some 

anticipated a quarterback com-
petition would unfold between 
McNamara, prized 5-star fresh-
man J.J. McCarthy and Texas 
Tech transfer Alan Bowman. 
Instead, the Michigan coaching 
staff handed the reins to McNa-
mara without much of a contest. 
One game in, the returns are 
undeniably positive. 

McNamara’s 
performance 

against the Broncos was not 
flawless, but growing pains are 
to be expected from a first-time 
full-time starting quarterback. 

A pair of McNamara’s passes 
were batted down at the line of 
scrimmage, perhaps a product of 
poor pass protection; on a sepa-
rate series, McNamara missed 
a wide-open Roman Wilson for 
a would-be touchdown, instead 
electing to dump the ball off in 
the flat. After the game, McNa-
mara noted that the offense 
had one communication mishap 
which he took fault for. 

For now, Michigan has no 

choice but to ride out McNama-
ra’s learning curve. The miscues 
are certainly palatable when 
accompanied by the consistent 
production that McNamara pro-
vided on Saturday. 

From the onset, McNamara 

appeared comfortable. On Mich-
igan’s first drive, the Wolverines 
set the game’s tone, steamrolling 
their way 75 yards down the 
field in 3:51 minutes. McNama-
ra completed his only two pass 
attempts, ran the offense with 
tempo and helped complete a 
fourth down conversion. 

As the Wolverines continue 

to place an emphasis on the run 
game — which multiple play-
ers have labeled as the team’s 
offensive identity — McNama-
ra’s opportunities to sling the 
ball downfield may be limited. 
Yet, when called to do so against 
Western Michigan, he execut-
ed with precision, a trait that 
plagued his predecessor, Joe 
Milton. 

Early in the second quarter, 

McNamara dropped in a beau-
tiful pass down the sideline for 
senior receiver Ronnie Bell, 
who made a tremendous catch 
that was called back due to a 
dubious offensive pass interfer-
ence call. On the very next pos-
session, McNamara found Bell 

again, floating in a perfectly 
placed spiral that Bell took the 
distance for a 76-yard touch-
down. 

“They were showing us a few 

different things that we were 
expecting,” McNamara said. “I 
was able to recognize it and was 
able to see the 1-on-1 with Ron-
nie. He made a great route, and 
all I had to do was put it out front 
for him.” 

McNamara makes it sound 

simple, but for a Michigan 
offense hoping to assert itself in 
the running game, he may not be 
asked to do much more. In the 
second half, McNamara attempt-
ed just two passes on two total 
drives. Still, one of those drives 
resulted in a touchdown follow-
ing a 74-yard jet sweep to sopho-
more receiver A.J. Henning. 

If McNamara can continue to 

complete passes like the one to 
Bell on a consistent basis, Michi-
gan would appear to be in good 
hands. 

“I think whatever the game-

plan sees fit will determine our 
run-to-pass ratio,” McNamara 
said. “I don’t mind — I thought 
the calling today was perfect. 
We got the job done. Running 
the ball a little bit more, I don’t 
mind that, it makes my job a lit-
tle bit easier.” 

McNamara’s 
difficulty 
is 

only amplified from this point 
forward. A primetime matchup 
against No. 20 Washington on 
Saturday, Sept. 11, and with 
Bell’s status suddenly precari-
ous following a right leg injury, 
he may be without his most-
dependable option for the long 
haul. 

But for one game, at least, 

McNamara gave the Wolverines 
all they could have asked for. 

In season opener, McNamara 

performs as hoped

At first, it looked as if noth-

ing had changed. 

On 
Western 
Michigan’s 

first drive against the Michi-
gan football team on Satur-
day, it had no trouble picking 
apart defensive coordinator 
Mike Macdonald’s “new-look” 
defense. On the first play, a 
receiver found himself open on 
a crossing route but dropped 
the open pass. Moments later, 
senior 
cornerback 
Gemon 

Green — the team’s strongest 
corner in 2020 — got beat over-
the-top for a 28-yard gain. As 
the Wolverines continued to 
struggle in coverage, the Bron-
cos easily marched down the 
field and quickly evened the 
score at seven. 

But somewhere en route to 

Michigan’s 
47-14 
thumping 

of Western Michigan, those 
problems 
dissipated. 
As 
if 

spurred by the possibility that 
significant 
struggles 
could 

derail the entire season, the 
Wolverines’ defensive backs 
glued themselves to opposing 
wideouts and paralyzed the 
Broncos’ initially lively pass-
ing game. Those seven points 
on the first drive ended up as 
their only non-garbage-time 
points of the game. 

“I thought (Macdonald) did 

a great job mixing the coverag-
es,” Michigan coach Jim Har-
baugh said. “Right before the 
second half, (he) started going 
to more of a two-high shell as 
we were stopping the run and 
playing more coverage, which 
made their quarterback hold 
the ball a little bit longer, and 

we were able to apply some 
pressure.”

Those adjustments made an 

immediate impact. After for-
feiting 89 yards and 8-for-12 
passing in the first quarter, 
Michigan held Western Michi-
gan to just one completion for 
no gain on six attempts in the 
second quarter. In total, the 
Wolverines allowed 11 comple-
tions for 102 yards in the final 
three quarters. 

Central to that improve-

ment was junior Daxton Hill, 
who played mostly as a nickel 
corner after starting as a deep 
safety last season. Playing 
closer to the line of scrim-
mage, Hill was more regularly 
involved in the pass defense 
and used his athleticism not 
just to disrupt passes that 
went his way, but also to dis-
guise coverages and confuse 
Broncos 
quarterback 
Kaleb 

Eleby. Even when he looked 
beat, Hill managed to make 
plays, such as late in the third 
quarter when he dove to break 
up a pass over the middle near 
midfield. 

“That position makes a big 

difference for us in the back 
seven,” 
senior 
cornerback 

Vincent Gray said. “Because 
his disguises and what he 
does with his disguise plays a 
big role in the quarterback’s 
checks. … Whether he’s blitz-
ing or whether he’s not blitz-
ing, the coverage he’s playing 
or not playing, they’re pretty 
much looking at him to see 
what we’re in, so him moving 
around and giving him differ-
ent looks is really good for us 
in the back seven.”

The defensive front, too, 

played a major role in Michi-

gan’s improved pass defense. 
After struggling to get enough 
push early on, the Wolverines’ 
blitzers — led by senior defen-
sive end Aidan Hutchinson 
and junior defensive lineman 
Mazi Smith — wore down the 
offensive line and put more 
pressure on Eleby as the game 
wore 
on. 
Ultimately, 
that 

effort was highlighted by a 
third quarter strip sack from 
Hutchinson. 

There were, of course, still 

some 
shaky 
moments. 
On 

Western Michigan’s last drive 
of the first half, Gray found 
himself beat over the top by 
Broncos receiver Jaylen Hall. 
Hall ended up dropping the 
pass, but the play still demon-
strated how, even when Michi-
gan drops into zone, opposing 
offenses will find ways to get 
the 
one-on-one 
matchups 

they want. Regardless of the 
scheme, the cornerbacks still 
need to be able to run with 
receivers, and if they can’t, the 
problems of 2020 will persist.

Still, the Wolverines’ staff 

seems to recognize that. The 
willingness to adjust after 
those first quarter struggles 
marks a departure from the 
defenses of years past. A win 
over Western Michigan only 
says so much about the team’s 
overall 
improvement, 
but 

any remaining questions will 
almost certainly be answered 
next week against Washing-
ton. 

“We 
haven’t 
done 
any-

thing yet,” Gray said. “We can 
improve a lot. We made a lot of 
mistakes that probably will go 
unnoticed.”

Added 
Hutchinson: 
“We 

haven’t done a damn thing.”

After shaky start, pass defense settles 

in against Western Michigan

As the offseason dwindled down 

and the predictions for the 2021 
season started to pour in, it didn’t 
take long for the comparisons to 
start. 

Blake Corum — the Michigan 

football team’s athletic 5-foot-8 
sophomore running back — bore 
a strikingly similar figure to Mike 
Hart, the legendary 5-foot-9 former 
rusher who returned this season 
as the Wolverines’ running backs 
coach. Writers, of course, happily 
pointed out that similarity. 

Hart, though, was quick to dis-

miss the narrative. 

“He works a lot harder,” Hart 

said on Aug. 19. “… He’s a lot faster 
than me, a lot quicker than me. If I 
was that fast, I’d probably still be in 
the NFL.”

One of the main questions fac-

ing the Michigan offense enter-
ing the season was how it would 
divide up carries within its talent-
ed, albeit shallow, running-backs 
room. Would it rely on senior Has-
san Haskins — the program’s most 
experienced runner and the leading 
rusher in 2020 — as a de facto work-
horse back or use the Hart-like tal-
ents of Corum and elite athleticism 
of freshman Donovan Edwards for a 
more dynamic rushing attack?

Saturday’s 47-14 win over West-

ern Michigan began to answer that 
question. 

Corum’s performance — which 

featured 111 rushing yards on 14 
attempts, two receptions for 22 
yards, two total touchdowns and an 
electrifying 79-yard kick return — 
showed just how effective he can be 
when used properly. When placed 
alongside Haskins’s 70 yards on 13 
carries, it highlighted the coaching 
staff’s intent to use the two backs as 
virtual co-starters. 

Even more, it showed that Corum 

deserved his place in that one-two 
punch.

“Both (are) standout players,” 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh told 
reporters Monday. “We’ve been 
saying they’re both the starting 
running back. Said we were gonna 
lean on them and ride them. That’s 
the plan.”

For Corum, that step into a 

starting job marks an upgrade from 
last season, where Haskins more 
than doubled Corum’s workload 
and production. Many of the play 
designs were similar to last year — 
lots of swing routes, runs around 
the edge and plays designed to get 
the ball into space — but Corum’s 
role in the offense visibly grew in 
that first game. 

In that starting role, he flour-

ished. The stats communicate that 
Corum had a strong game, but they 
don’t even tell the full story. They 
don’t show how, on his swing-pass 
touchdown, Corum waited for 
junior wide receiver Mike Sainris-
til’s block before bursting into the 
gap. Nor do they say how — on his 
30-yard rushing touchdown later 

on — he knew exactly where to cut 
back to find the most space. 

The film doesn’t just display a 

sophomore back with some excit-
ing athleticism; it tells the story of 
a smart player gaining more con-
fidence in his abilities with every 
rush. 

“I feel like I was more patient 

today,” Corum said Saturday. 
“But when you’re playing, you 
can’t really tell how patient you 
actually are. I feel like I took what 
I did in the offseason and applied 
it today.”

That doesn’t take anything away 

from Haskins, either. Much of the 
discrepancy in yardage between 
the two backs can be attributed 
to how they were used. In three 
different scenarios, Haskins was 

brought in on third-and-one to pick 
up the first down. Although one of 
those plays resulted in a 22-yard 
touchdown run, the use of Haskins 
in third-and-short situations dem-
onstrates how the coaches see 
him more as a short-yardage back 
because of his physicality. Corum’s 
only third-down runs, conversely, 
came on third-and-five and third-
and-15. 

“(Haskins), he’s a strong dude,” 

Corum said. “It’s hard to tackle him, 
so he might run through you. Me, 
I’m more of a finesse guy, so I might 
make you fall. With a one-two 
punch with both of us that can make 
people miss at the second level, it’s 
hard to stop that. 

“It’s kind of like thunder and 

lightning.”

My Saturday started at 6:43 a.m. 

— a time I usually consider to be 
the middle of the night — to music 
blasting outside 
my door. It’s a 
familiar feeling 
but 
jarring 

nonetheless 
to 

be woken up by 
the first notes 
of Mo Bamba 
or Shipping Up 
to Boston. It’s 
a 
sensation 
I 

haven’t had in 
almost two years. 

While I tried to muster the 

strength to get out of bed, I sat 
listening to the sounds outside my 
window — the yells, the ‘Go Blues’ 
and music from wake-ups in houses 
just like my own — and waited for the 
sun to come up. 

It was game day in Ann Arbor. 
By 10:00 in the morning, almost 

every porch on my street was dotted 
with tailgaters, and stray cans of 
Keystone sprinkled the sidewalk. As 
I walked around, the hallmarks of 
gameday started coming back to me 

with a feeling almost like nostalgia. 
After the past year, the atmosphere 
simultaneously felt familiar and 
brand new. 

“The 
tailgate’s 
been 
great,” 

Engineering 
senior 
Christian 

Marciano said. “I’ve been having 
a great time. It feels a little lowkey 
though.” 

While Marciano felt the tailgates 

were less full than normal, it felt like 
business as usual to me. I walked by 
countless yards of boys playing beer 
die to the tune of songs I remember 
from tailgates past. 

By 11:30, my roommate was 

dragging me down Packard St., 
paranoid we were going to miss 
the pregame James Earl Jones 
video. I let her run ahead without 
me because I wanted to take my 
time. The walk down State Street to 
Hoover might be my favorite part of 
gameday. I love seeing the fans on 
the side of the road with their tents, 
full flatscreen TVs set up inside; the 
carts set up on the sidewalk selling 
food or water; everyone walking to 
the same endpoint. 

After arriving at the stadium, I 

met Ross junior Prat Bhola while I 
was standing in line. While some 
people were anxious to get inside, he 
was savoring the whole experience, 
line and all. 

“It’s electric,” Bhola said.
Electric is a great word to 

describe walking into the Big 
House. The first time I’d ever gone 
to Michigan Stadium was the 

2018 home-opener when I was a 
freshman, also against Western 
Michigan. I’d spent the morning 
walking around Ann Arbor with 
no sense of direction or purpose, 
surrounded by people I barely 
knew, looking for tailgates. I fell in 
love with the music, the dancing, 
the energy; it was everything I was 
hoping college would be. 

I hadn’t grown up as a Michigan 

fan — or much of a college football 
fan at all — but walking into the Big 
House the first time took my breath 
away. It’s hard to describe exactly 
what happens at that moment when 
you see the band and then you’re 
walking into the student section 
and the fight song starts and then, 
oh look, there’s that kid from your 
math class that you really don’t 
know but now, for some reason, you 
feel like you absolutely have to go 
say hi. 

It 
feels 
as 
though 
you’re 

overwhelmed by everything that 
Michigan is. 

LSA freshman Henry Shaver had 

been waiting for that moment from 
the minute he stepped on campus. 

He watched his older brother James, 
also a Michigan student, attend 
tailgates and games for years, but 
nothing could adequately prepare 
him for what it was like. 

“I thought I had an idea (of what it 

was like), but I was pretty surprised 
when I got here,” Shaver said. “… 
There’s definitely a lot more people 
out here than I thought.” 

When I walked into the stadium 

on Saturday, I felt a similar rush, but 
it wasn’t exactly the same. In some 
ways, it was even more exciting. 
After almost two years away, not one 
of the 109,295 people in attendance 
was taking that moment for granted. 

“Walking into the stadium, just 

being there for the first time in over 
a year, it was actually just an amazing 
experience,” junior Jack Mooney said. 
“The crowd, everyone was just so 
happy to be there. The experience was 
probably my favorite game day yet. 
It’s a big part of my college experience 
and it was definitely missing from my 
experience last year.”

But being in a crowd that large 

now means something different 
than it did two years ago. 

Even though I’m vaccinated, I 

didn’t feel 100% confident being 
in that large of a group. Michigan 
announced in March that the 
stadium would have fans, long 
before the delta variant threatened 
to reverse our progress. Despite the 
rising number of COVID-19 cases, 
masks were encouraged but not 
required in the stadium and very 

few students wore them, something 
Marciano found to be contradictory. 
 

“It’s stupid because I’m in class 

with 12 people and then I’m about to 
be in a stadium with 110,000 people 
and it kind of makes no sense (that 
the COVID-19 restrictions are so 
different),” Marciano said. 

Currently, 92% of students have 

reported their vaccination with the 
school, but preliminary data showed 
102 new positive cases within the 
school community last week. To 
put that number in perspective, the 
highest number of positive cases on 
campus was 410 last October. It will 
be another couple of weeks before 
we’re able to determine whether the 
game brings that number any higher. 

Still, the students I talked to 

weren’t 
concerned 
about 
the 

possibility of infection, and I see 
where they are coming from. Looking 
out at a crowd of over 100,000, it’s 
easy to forget that we’re still in the 
middle of a devastating pandemic. 

Even though COVID-19 hasn’t 

disappeared, the students I talked 
to found it refreshing to experience 
“normalcy,” even if it was just for a 
few hours. 

Mooney is a lifelong Michigan 

fan, but last season he felt like his 
heart wasn’t in it. Part of that could 
be the Wolverines’ dismal 2-4 

record, but mostly it was being stuck 
at home, relegated to watching from 
the couch. 

“I think it’s more or less just being 

in the stadium where you’re with 
100,000 people who all have the 
same exact interest to you,” Mooney 
said. “It’s very rare in life where 
you’re in a place that every person 
around you has the exact same goal. 
I feel like people are very divided on 
a lot of different issues nowadays. 
I think sports in general — and 
especially Michigan football — is 
something we can all come together 
and just support at once, and it’s just 
such a really special experience to be 
part of that.”

Mooney left the game after Mr. 

Brightside was played — a song that’s 
become a cult favorite for Michigan 
fans over the past several years — and 
watched the rest of the game from 
home. For him, the game itself can be 
watched at home, but Mr. Brightside 
is a can’t-miss. It’s the traditions that 
define the experience. 

Thirty years from now, I won’t 

remember that the score was 47-14. 
I won’t remember the Wolverines’ 
emphasis on the run game. I probably 
won’t even remember that they were 
playing Western Michigan. What I 
will remember is that this was game 
day in Ann Arbor.

One aspect of soccer that is 

often overlooked is moments of 
transition. These are the few 
seconds following a change in 
possession. They are often the 
time when the ball is the easiest 
to win back and hardest to keep. 
They can also be when a defense 
is most vulnerable because their 
players are set up to attack, not 
defend.

People tend to focus on 

what happens near the goals, 
as finishing and goalkeeping 
ultimately 
decide 
the 
final 

score. However, winning the 
transition moments consistently 
is how a team can dominate the 
game. The No. 24 Michigan 
women’s soccer team did just 
that in its 1-0 victory over 
DePaul on Sunday. 

“It’s 
something 
that 
we 

have to work on every day 
within training, so when it 
comes to the game we’re able 
to execute,” Michigan coach 
Jennifer Klein said. “I think 
it’s a mentality, it’s a work rate 
that really puts us in a position 
to do that.”

After 
any 
of 
their 
own 

turnovers, 
the 
Wolverines 

consistently won the ball back 
within a few passes. When 
they didn’t, they ensured that 
they recovered their defensive 
shape quickly enough to avoid 
dangerous counterattacks.

Fifth-year senior midfielder 

Sarah 
Stratigakis 
recovered 

the ball multiple times, chasing 
down the Blue Demons and 
taking 
back 
possession 
for 

Michigan. 
Senior 
defender 

Janiece Joyner was also crucial 
to this process, particularly 
in 
stopping 
counterattacks. 

Any time DePaul tried to use 
its forwards as a quick outlet, 
Joyner was there to either 
intercept the pass or slow down 
the attack enough to give her 
teammates time to recover. 

“It’s 
something 
that 
we 

practice,” Joyner said. “Our 
coach really trains us to win 
the ball back quickly and win 
possession.”

Winning 
the 
defensive 

side of transition helped the 
Wolverines keep a clean sheet, 
while the offensive moments 
won them the game. Joyner 
was also crucial on that side 
of the ball. After winning the 

ball defensively, she constantly 
found the first pass to keep the 
ball and start attacks.

“One of our goals is to connect 

the first pass once we get it 
back,” Joyner said. “If we are 
able to go we want to go quickly 
and create chances, but if not, 
we are totally comfortable with 
just holding it and swinging it 
around the back and waiting for 
the right time to go.”

Quick counterattacks led to 

some of the Wolverines’ best 
chances and, most importantly, 
the goal. The breakthrough came 
following a DePaul turnover 
in the midfield, followed by 
a quick pass down the wing 
before the ball eventually found 
its way to a wide-open fifth-
year senior midfielder Nicki 
Hernandez at the back post to 
score. In the end, winning the 
game came down to winning 
the transitional seconds and 
translating practice sequences 
into the game.

“We build those moments 

into 
training,” 
Klein 
said. 

“There were sequences where 
we won it, we had players in 
right positions and we had 
players running, and I’m happy 
that we’re getting there.”

Transition offense keys win over DePaul 

Fifth-year 
senior 
midfielder 

Sarah Stratigakis felt the pressure as 
she trapped a pass in a sea of DePaul 
defenders. Not wanting to give up a 
prime scoring opportunity, she made 
a short pass to senior midfielder 
Raleigh Loughman at the top of the 
penalty arc.

The Blue Demons moved up, 

charging toward the ball but 
forgetting about fifth-year senior 
midfielder Nicki Hernandez near 
the left corner of the goal area. A 
quick pass to Loughman opened 
up an angle to hit Hernandez as she 
willed her pass around the defense. 
Hernandez took two touches before 
firing the ball safely into the bottom 
right corner, breaking Michigan’s 
goalless streak in its 155th minute.

The Wolverines’ aggressive play 

— shown by Hernandez’s goal — 
persisted on both sides of the ball to 
propel No. 24 Michigan (5-1) to a 1-0 
victory over DePaul (2-3) on Sunday. 
The Blue Demons couldn’t adapt to 
the Wolverines’ pressure, and they 
were outshot 27-5.

But Michigan wasn’t always 

in total control. After sophomore 
forward Sammi Woods got early 
chances to start the game, the 
midfield forced many passes leaving 
the Wolverines’ defensive half. 
DePaul earned quick shots from 

these errors.

As a result, Michigan switched 

up its strategy, focusing on shorter 
range passes between defenders and 
the midfield that it then carried up 
the side of the field. The Blue Demons 
didn’t adjust, and the Wolverines 
generated shot after shot.

“Sometimes at the start of the 

game you’ve gotta get into it and 
you’ve gotta settle in,” Michigan 
coach Jennifer Klein said. “I think 
what’s good about them is they don’t 
get rattled in that moment … They 
got into a rhythm and were able to 
find the spaces.”

Energy 
punctuated 
the 

Wolverines’ 
game 
plan, 
and 

they utilized 19 different players 
throughout the game. Relentlessly 
attacking the ball led to countless 
chances for Michigan, and that 
eventually led to the game’s only goal 
in the 34th minute.

“I really like that we have such 

a talented group of players,” senior 
defender Janiece Joyner said. “We’re 
able to rotate a lot of people.”

Woods played a large role in that 

energy, chasing the ball and keeping 
DePaul from settling in. She took 
three shots at the beginning of the 
second half, but the Blue Devils 
cleared the ball out of their zone to 
end her attack.

“(Woods) was threatening in 

some good areas,” Klein said. “ (She) 
had some good interchange with 
different players, and so I think that 

movement really put her in some 
great positions … she’s right there 
knocking at the door.”

The Wolverines looked strong, 

but their problems converting 
ample shots into goals in Friday’s 
loss against Southern California 
continued against DePaul. They 
forced Blue Demons goalkeeper 
Mollie Eriksson to make tough 
saves, but couldn’t find the back of 
the net. 

It looked like Michigan would 

score a second goal in the 56th 
minute when Stratigakis shot the 
ball high above Eriksson. A hollow 
clang rattled through the stadium 
as the ball bounced straight down 
off the crossbar. The Wolverines 
thought the ball went in, but the 
officials did not review it.

Outside of offense, Michigan’s 

back line stood tall. Junior defender 
Jayde Riviere and Joyner cleared 
any DePaul attempts.

Much of this came from closing 

on any Blue Demon attacker with 
the ball. Forwards tried to pass back 
to midfielders and reset plays, but 
they never settled into the tight area 
the defense gave them.

Michigan 
thoroughly 
beat 

DePaul, but still struggled to turn 
lopsided offensive chances into 
multiple tallies on the scoreboard. 
The Wolverines’ biggest question 
— how to capitalize on huge 
shot

— 
remained 

unanswered.

Adaptation leads to victory over Blue

Three 
months 
after 
its 

last competitive match, the 
Michigan 
men’s 
golf 
team 

returned to the course this 
weekend. And after the hiatus, 
the rust showed.

The 
Wolverines 
finished 

3rd 
in 
the 
Island 
Resort 

Intercollegiate, 
their 
first 

tournament of the season. With 
a final score of 880, course 
management and a poor short 
game ultimately led Michigan 
to an underwhelming final 
placement, losing to Michigan 
State and Central Florida. 

The Wolverines opened the 

tournament scoring a group 
290, led by a career-best 69 
from sophomore Will Anderson. 
Senior Patrick Sullivan finished 
his first round with an even 72 
par and matched it in the second 
round. Michigan collectively 
recorded a 285 in round two, led 
by junior Pier Francesco De Col 
and Sullivan’s 72. De Col ended 
the day with a team-best 143. 

With 
a 
few 
individual 

standouts, Michigan showed 
the potential to challenge for 
a top-two finish the next day. 
What came next surprised the 
Wolverines. 

“The first day was fairly 

windy,” Michigan coach Zach 
Barlow said. “I thought we did 
pretty well. Monday was much 
cooler and the course was set 
up much longer. From day one 
to day two, there was quite a 
difference in the course length 
and that caught us off guard.” 

Michigan entered day two 

with Anderson dominating once 
again. Tallying a 74, his score 
proved to be the Wolverines’ 
best. De Col and Sullivan 
followed his lead, both scoring 
a 78 and ending with a 221 
and 222, respectively. In the 
final round of the tournament, 
freshman Yuqi Liu recorded a 
71, ultimately making up for the 
team’s errors throughout the 
match. 

“(Liu) is just getting his feet 

wet in the collegiate scene,” 
Barlow said. “He’ll play a big 
part moving forward.” 

The new recruits continued 

to show their value as freshman 
Hunter Thomson ended the 
weekend in 39th place, scoring 
a 69 in the second round and 
ending the tournament with 
a total of 228. A highly-rated 
player, Thomson showed why 
his future is bright in Ann 
Arbor. 

“Sky’s 
the 
limit 
for 

(Thomson),” Barlow said. “It’s 
different when there’s added 
pressure playing as a team. 
There’s a lot of pressure but his 
second round held us together. 
Showing the team and bouncing 
back is a big deal.” 

Michigan now has a three-

week break before heading to 
Yale for the Macdonald Cup. 
The Wolverines will have time 
to work on reading course 
conditions, adjusting to weather 
and executing close to the pin.

“This was a step forward 

in that we got in that final 
group,” Barlow said. “It’s a big 
deal. What we learned today 
we will use later on in the year 
… The more time we’re in that 
situation, the better we’ll be.” 

‘M’ finishes third in Island Resort 

Intercollegiate

Monday, 
the 
Michigan 

men’s 
soccer 
team 
hosted 

Loyola University Chicago. The 
Wolverines rallied in the second 
half, overcoming a halftime deficit 
to win 2-1, their first home win of 
the season. 

The first half was largely 

dominated by the Ramblers. They 
struck first, 11 minutes into the 
game. Midfielder Oscar Dueso 
sent a long pass to forward John 
Gates, who beat three Michigan 
defenders to put it in the goal. 

While 
Loyola 
got 
going 

offensively, its defense held the 
Wolverines to only two shots. 
Their defensive scheme forced 
Michigan to take shots from the 
corners instead of getting quality 
chances in front.

In the middle of the first half, 

junior forward Evan Rasmussen 
sent a pass toward the box 
where junior forward Moshtaba 
Al-Hasnawi was wide open, but 
the timing of the pass was off, 
and the chance was lost. These 

mistakes plagued the Wolverines 
as the offense sputtered in the first 
half.

“I think for us it is important 

that 
we 
are 
aggressive 
and 

unselfish,” Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley said. “I think those are the 
two things that we want to remind 
the players about.” 

After the intermission, the 

Wolverines came out of the locker 
room firing on all cylinders. 
Michigan matched its first half 
shot count in the first two minutes 
of the second half. 

Accurate 
passes 
led 
to 

longer possessions and scoring 
opportunities. Fifth-year senior 
midfielder Marc Ybarra drew a 
penalty kick and scored to tie the 
game at one. 

“At halftime, we talked about 

being aggressive in our mindset 
and how we play,” Daley said. “The 
second half was very frantic for 
their back three and as a result, 
they made a couple mistakes. 
Fortunately, we took advantage of 
those mistakes.” 

Michigan held Loyola nearly 

shotless in the second half, with 
the Ramblers lone opportunity 

coming in the 64th minute. The 
Loyola attacker found himself 
one-on-one with the goalie, but 
freshman 
goalkeeper 
Hayden 

Evans came up with a big save to 
keep the game tied. 

Four 
minutes 
later, 
the 

Wolverines 
capitalized 
on 

an opportunity of their own. 
Michigan had good movement in 
front of the opposing net, leading 
to a goal from junior forward 
Inaki Rodriguez on a pass from 
freshman defender Jason Buckner, 
giving the Wolverines a 2-1 lead.

For the rest of the second 

half, Michigan played aggressive 
defense and kept the Ramblers 
outside of the offensive zone. 

All in all, the Wolverines held on 

for the win, but left something to 
be desired. 

“We 
created 
mistakes 
for 

Loyola late in the game and stole 
a goal,” Daley said. “We are now 
creating them in the run of play, 
so now we can put together a full 
performance. We are gonna have 
to start (putting together full 
performances) as our games get 
more challenging, certainly when 
the Big Ten slate starts.”
