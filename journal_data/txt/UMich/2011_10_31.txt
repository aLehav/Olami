House majority
leader to speak
at League today
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
and JENNIFER LEE
Daily StaffReporter
With U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor
(R-Va.) traveling to campus
today, one party's line will be
the picket line.
Students and members
of local organizations who
oppose the House majority
leader's political and economic
stances are expected to protest
Cantor's presence on campus.
His visit is sponsored by the
Ford School of Public Policy.
Cantor has been a member
of the House of Representa-
tives since 2001 and was elect-
ed House majority leader in
January. Cantor was originally
scheduled to give a talk in Feb-
ruary but didn't make it due to
inclement weather.
Organizations formally
involved in the protests of
today's event include the
Washtenaw Community
Action Team, a local labor
rights group, and the Uni-
versity of Michigan Planners
Network, a campus group of

Read viewpoints from the College
Republicans and.Democrats.

Accord-
ing to the Washtenaw Com-
munity Action Team's website,
the protest will be Halloween-
themed and will feature a the-
atrical "funeral for the middle
class." The group is encourag-
ing protesters to come dressed
in costume.
Architecture and Urban
Planning student Elias Schew-
el helped organize the protest,
which will take place in the
Michigan League, where Can-
tor is scheduled to speak.
Schewel, a member of the
Planners Network, said he and
others are united bytheir "dis-

verybody do it together.
One. Two. Three. Exhale.
The Michigan football
team is done with two-thirds
of its season. Its sample size is
big enough. The team on the
field is the team that's going to
show up for the remaining four
games. And after holding Purdue
to 14 points, we know what the
defense is.
Well, kind of good.
f Other than against Notre
Dame. (Stop for a second and
reminisce on the end of that
game one more time, I'll see you

on the other side of the sentence)
the defense hasn't allowed more
than 24 _
points ina
game. Michi-
gan ranks
eighth in
the country
in scoring
defense.
Whenever MICHAEL
the Wolver- FLOREK
ines need a
turnover or a
stop, the defense has the uncanny
ability to deliver - like defensive

end Craig Roh stuffing Purdue
on 3rd and 2 ina tie game early
in the first quarter, or sophomore
cornerback Courtney Avery
intercepting the Boilermakers on
Michigan's 16-yard line to hold
onto a five-point lead.
So stop holding your breath.
The point Michigan fans have
been waiting for all season, when
the defense reverts back into its
historic ineptitude, won't hap-
pen. Saturday proved it.
The past two years indicated
that this game, the one after
the Michigan State game, was

when everything was supposed
to go wrong. The Wolverines
were supposed to lose a game
they shouldn't have. Instead, the
defense gave up just 192 yards
through three quarters and less
than 100 rushing for the third
time this season.
Michigan's defense has had
plenty of chances to regress. If
it hasn't happened by now, it's
not happening. Michigan coach
Brady Hoke's caveman-like,
"DEFENSE BE PHYSICAL,"
mentality has worked.

UNIVERSITY FINANCES
CFO Slottow:'U'
financial health
. is 'quite strong'

Record high
endowment at
$7.8 billion
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
University administrators say
they're cautiously optimistic about
the University's current financial
status.
The University's endowment
grew from $6.5 billion last year to
$7.8 billion this year - the highest
in its history. Investment returns
are at 24.3 percent, according to
the the University's 2011 financial
report released earlier this month,
Timothy Slottow, the Univer-
sity's executive vice president and
chief financial officer, said in an
interview last week that the suc-
cess of this year's endowment is the
result of years of planning. How-
ever, he added that a bit of luck is
at play since investment returns
vary from year to year, and state

funds fluctuate depending on the
economy.
"We expect there to be volatil-
ity," Slottow said.
Slottow and his team at the Uni-
versity's Office of Investments have
seen a decade of year-over-year
investment performances. High
performance this year is partially
due to 49 percent returns on ven-
ture capital and private equity
investments, Slottow said.
Last year, the University had the
seventh-highest endowment of all
postsecondary institutions. Data
comparing multiple universities'
endowments is not yet available for
this year.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said in an interview with
The Michigan Daily that she is
pleased to enter her second decade
leading the-University with the
institution in a strong financial
position.
"My whole-experience here has
been making tough choices, mak-
ing sure that we continue to invest

'U' alumni honored for design of Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial

4

Chaffers on Friday for their
instrumental roles in the design
and production of the memorial,
in addition to their contribution
to the ideals put forward by King
himself. Jackson served as execu-
tive architectof the memorial and
Chaffers, a professor emeritus in
the College of Architecture and
Urban Planning, served as senior
design juror.
Moderated by Milton Curry,
associate dean of the College of
Architecture and Urban Plan-
ning, the event consisted of a
question-and-answer session
among a panel of scholars from
the University and the area. The
panel members discussed the,
moral and ethical implications of
converting King's ideology into a
concrete structure.
According to the panelists, a
discussion regarding the lack of
markers on the National Mall
showing African Americans'
contribution to the country led
to the creation of the memorial,
which was originally conceived
in 1983 and was dedicated on
Oct. 16. Honoring King was a
logical choice, but exactly how
to commemorate his vision for
international peace and justice
was unclear.
"We knew that Dr. King was
a person of many facets," Chaf-
fers said. "Even today we still
have yet to comprehend and cap-
ture the magnitude of Dr. King's
mind."
Using a famous line from

King's 1963 speech, "out of the
mountain of despair a stone of
hope," the architectural team
decided to visually render his
words. The monument displays
King on a stone that appears to
be extracted from a giantboulder
- a physical 30-foot tall stone of
hope "out of the mountain of
despair" King surmounted dur-
ing his life. Jackson said Chi-
nese sculptor Lei Yixin wished
to portray King as a "warrior
for peace" by having him jut out
of the stone as a soldier might
charge into battle.
Jackson said the design-
ers wanted the monument not
simply to be representative of
a man from the past, but rather
to remind visitors of King's key
values in the form of a "living
memorial."
"We move beyond looking at
Dr. King as a civil rights leader,"
he said. "This should be a memo-
rial for a global leader for peace
that captures his four main
themes: justice, democracy, hope
and love."
The panelists also noted the
broader cultural ramifications
the memorial has for Washing-
ton, D.C. and the country. Tour-
ists from around the world who
visit the National Mall will now
see King in the context in which
he belongs, adjacent to the best-
known American leaders and
patriots, said Jon Onye Lockard,
artist and adjunct senior lecturer
in the Department of Afroameri-

can and African Studies.
"King stands next to Lincoln,
Jefferson and the Washington
Monument," Lockard said. 'We
sometimes forget about things
like who built D.C. and slave
labor. But these things are part
of our history. And when people
look at the memorial they will
not see it standing alone. This
will help bring out people's
humanity."
For Jackson and Chaffers,
King's message is one thatshould
never be forgotten, one as impor-
tant as the civil rights movement
itself.
"This nponument is as much
about America as it is about Dr.
King," Jackson said in an inter-
view after the event.
The monument and its natural
surroundings will remind visi-
tors to renew their commitment
to King's goals every.year, Jack-
son said during the panel. The
memorial team planted an addi-
tional 182 cherry blossoms to the
Tidal Basin's collection.,
"Our children will go on their
eighth grade school trips to D.C.
and see King next to Lincoln and
Jefferson," Kelly Quinn, director
and chief curator of the Museum
of Contemporary Art Detroit,
said during the discussion. "The
memorial is going to be in kids'
Facebook photos. People will fall
in love under the memorial. It'sa
living monument and all sorts of
life will happen under that mon-
ument."

The Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial was unveiled in Washington D.C. earlier this month.

Memorial stands on the National

image looms powerfully over the
northwest corner of the Tidal
Basin - the same spot where
each spring cherry blossoms
blanket the basin in a sea of pink
and white.
Though the pink and white

blossoms may continue to frame
the memorial for years to come,
the memorial would never have
come to fruition without the
hard work and dedication of two
men representing the maize and

ble being the House Republican
Plan for America's Job Creators.
The plan includes reductions in
federal spending and revisions to
the tax code and patent system.
"Right now, the Republican
Party is an economic nightmare
for this country, and Eric Can-
tor is number two leadership in
the Republican Party," Schewel
said. "... He has a very large mega-

phone with which to spread his
misinformation about the eco-
nomic policies that he's propos-
ing around the country."
LSA senior Amanda Caldwell,
chair of the University's chapter
of College Democrats, said her
group hasn't been involved in
planning the protest, but some
members of the College Demo-
crats will be participating.
"We're supportive of protest-
ing Eric Cantor's political ideol-
ogy and his inability to lead any
sort of movement to get bills

passed or get people worling
Caldwell said.
LSA junior Brian Koziara,
external vice chair of the Univer-
sity's chapter of College Repub-
licans, said the organization is
making efforts to support Can-
tor's visit.
"We're encouraging (our
members) to go and get tickets,"
Koziara said. "We'd like the audi-
ence at the event to be friendly,

ing the Summer 2011 term. He said
he is returning to the University
next semester at the request of the
Department of English Language
and Literature. As long as the
department wants himto teach, he
is happyto do it, he said.,
Faculty members do not often
come out of retirement, but Wil-
liams was an extremely popular
professor so the University made
an exception in his case, according
to Katherine Teasdale, the under-
graduate administrator of the Eng-
lish department.
"This is a highly unusual
arrangement for Professor Wil-
liams, acknowledging his unprec-
edented success in the classroom,"
Teasdale wrote in ane-mail inter-
view. "But because of Professor
Williams's reputation and exper-
tise, we thought it would be an
incredible learning experience for
our students."
Williams said he loves interact-
ing with students, which is one of
the reasons he was drawn back to
teaching.
"They sort of tug and pull and
pry at my mind and lead me on, and
both preparation for lecture (and)
discussion ... are a mode of my own
growth and it's marvelous, it really
is," Williams said.
Williams is renowned for get-
ting to know his students, despite
teaching many large classes.
"Remarkably, he knows the
names of his hordes of students,
and remembers things about their
lives that are important," Teasdale
wrote.
Williams said he tries to under-
stand his students because they
each have a different and impor-
tant point of view. He explained
that if students do not share their
perspectives, the history and cul-
ture of those students are not rec-
ognized. This, he said, isthe reason
he recognizes all of his students,
even if it is just with a glance or a
gesture.

LSA senior Kimberly Grambo
said Williams delivered a num-
ber of guest lectures to her Great
Books course during her freshman
year, and the classes she took with
him were memorable.
"Part of it was hype," Grambo
said. "Everyone showed up for this
lecture that he was in. The place
was packed, and it was just the
energy. He walks in, and it's like
every single lecture is a perfor-
mance."
Grambo said she expects Wil-
liams's return to be a big deal for
the institution.
"I think (his return) means
a lot," she said. "I heard that he
was coming back, actually, and it
reminded me of Michael Jordan."
While Williams has lectured at
other universities, he remained
a professor at the University of
Michigan for the entirety of his
career after a brief stint at Cornell
University in the late 1960s. Wil-
liams said he thinks the University
is the "best public university in
the land," and he appreciates how
much he has learned'from other
departments within the Univer-
sity.
"One of the lovely things about
Michigan is that whatever is stud-
ied is studied here and well, so I
tried to learn from people all over
the University," Williams said.
Throughout his time as a pro-
fessor and during his hiatus,
Williams undertook a number of
projects to improve the education-
al experience at the University.
One of the projects was col-
laborating with the Royal
Shakespeare Company, which
he worked with for a number of
years. He said he believes Shake-
speare productions are not only
educational, but also contribute
to the University's culture. Wil-
liams said University alumni fly
in from all over the United States
and the world to see some cam-
pus productions. Williams also
said he hopes to connect visiting
alumni with students through a
project called "The Stadium and
the Stage" so alumni can main-

tain their connection to the Uni-
versity.
Williams also pioneered the
"Chevrutah" approach to teaching
at the University, where students
are paired with another student for
the entire semester to discuss the
material together each class. Wil-
liamsusesthe formatinstead of the
typical discussion model, in which
some students speak more than
others, a style that goes against his
teaching philosophy. Williams said
he would like to continue develop-
ing the teaching format at the Uni-
versity during his return.
Williams summed up his feel-
ings about the University and
teaching in one line in Italian:
"If I were ever to have an epitaph
and deserved it, it might be one
from Dante, a line of his I par-
ticularly like, but it's one which
I would like to see characterize
this University - intellectual
light, full of love."'

Police and fire
departments aim to
prevent fires during
Halloween
DETROIT (AP) - If any-
one has any intention of setting
fires in Calvin Colbert's west-
side Detroit neighborhood, he
wants them to know that he'll be
watching.
The 62-year-old Colbert will
be one of thousands of city resi-
dents patrolling streets over the
annual Halloween period which
began yesterday with Angels'
Night.
The coordinated effort by the
city, police and fire departments
and neighborhood groups is
aimed at reducing the number of
fires intentionally set to vacant
buildings, houses, garages and
trash containers.
On the blocks he patrols near
Cody High School, there have
been few arsons around Hallow-
een over the past few years, Col-
bert said.
"I do remember the years
when we were going from fire to
fire," he said. "For the last two
years, the deterrence is in place,
and people know there are going
to be a number of people out
patrolling. That deters individu-
als from trying to do arsons."
Detroit gained national and
world-wide notoriety during the
1980s when vandals delighted
in starting fires across the city
over what then was known as
devils' night. In 1984, more than
800 fires were started over three

days.
The city began to mobilize
volunteers to augment police
patrols, and the name Angels'
Night eventually was coined.
Last year, firefighters
responded to 169 blazes, most in
vacant structures. There were
119 fires reported in 2009 and
136 in 2008.
A city-wide curfew banning
children younger than 18 from
being outside without adult
supervision was to go into effect
at 6 p.m. Sunday.
It's also illegal to pump gaso-
line into portable containers
or to carry any flammable' liq-
uid until 11:59 p.m. on Monday.
The ordinance does not apply in
emergency situations for any-
one over age 18 where the fuel
is needed for a stalled vehicle,
heating a home or for use in an
emergency generator.
"We are targeting our pre-
vention activities leading up to
it," Detroit Fire Chief Kwaku
Atara said about Angels' Night.
"We are speaking to commu-
nity groups and middle and high
school students."
Police and firefighters have
their jobs to do, but much of the
work also should fall on Detroi-
ters, Colbert said.
He also is part of Brothers on
Patrol, a group of men who patrol
public bus stops around Cody
High in the mornings and after-
noons to deter fights, robberies
and other acts of violence.
"It is the responsibility of the
residents - those that live here
- to create a safe environment,"
Colbert said. "The solution and
answer is you."

Tapping the issue
New keg law will not reduce underage drinking
Starting tomorrow, students may think twice before purchasing
a keg. Michigan passed a stricter law regarding the purchase of
kegs, which requires the buyer to provide identification infor-
mation that will be recorded and tagged on the keg. While the new
law is meant to address the problem of underage drinking, it fails to
get to the bottom of the issue and has the potential to unfairly penal-
ize keg purchasers.

Semotion 'guilt' affects our lives and how to deal with it.

The troubled 53%

As of Nov.1, all individuals who buy a keg
will have to provide their driver's license,
address, phone number and date of birth to
the retailer. This information will then be
transferred to a kegtag. If the police break up
a party where underage drinking is occurring,
they can use the keg tagto find the person who
rented it and charge him or her with provid-
ing alcohol to minors - an offense punishable
by $1,000 in fines and a 60 day jail sentence. If
the tag is removed, the purchaser may be pun-
ished with up to 93 days in jail and a $500 fine.
The new law specifically targets college stu-
dents - minors and people over age 21. Kegs
are often bought for parties on college cam-
puses and, more often than not, party hosts
do not check identification before permitting
access to alcohol.
The logic behind the law is that the tag will
make students 21 or older hesitantto buya keg
for a party that minors may attend. But the law
does nothing to combat consumption of other
alcoholic beverages, like hard liquor, which
can be far more dangerous than beer when
consumed in large quantities.
With the new law in place, underage drink-
ing will in all likelihood continue to occur
on college campuses in Michigan. What will
change is the potential of usjust accusation

for of-age students who legally purchase a
keg. There are too many variables contribut-
ing to this possibility: There is no way to prove
if underage drinkers drank from the keg,
someone could easily remove the tag without
the purchaser's knowledge and police cannot
prove thatonly one individual paid for the keg.
The law has many flaws, which is worri-
some when severe punishments are involved.
Providing alcohol for minors is a serious
charge that could derail a student's future.
Michigan already has some of the strictest
underage drinking laws in the country, and
the addition of the keg tag law suggests legis-
lators are intent on making Michigan's young
people criminals more than actually prevent-
ing underage drinking.
Drinking on college campuses is not dan-
gerous because some students who choose to
do so are underage. It's dangerous because
of the nature and amount of alcoholic bever-
ages students consume. This law can make the
former problem worse - potentially causing
more consumption of hard liquor in place of
keg beer - and doesn't address the latter. The
real solution is education. The goal should be
to teach young people how to drink safely and
responsibly, and the keg registration law does
neither.

ne of the many patholo-
gies of political culture
in a country with only
two relevant political parties is
there's no such
thing as nov-
elty. When the
Occupy Wall
Street protest-
ers described
themselves
as agitators L
against the
misdeeds of NEILL
the 1 percent MOHAMMAD
of American
households
that own 35 percent of the coun-
try's wealth, conservative blogger
Erick Erickson didn't just wrack his
brain for a way to attack OWS - the
logic of American political debate
demanded that he do so with their
own language. And, voila, now
anyone who objects to OWS's self-
appointment as the guardians of
"99% of Americans" can now iden-
tify themselves with an even more
exclusive club: "the 53% of Ameri-
cans who pay income taxes." You,
too, can join The 53% by posting a
webcam image of yourself and your
manifesto at the53.tumblr.com.
One thing that The 53% have in
common is a palpable, visceral dis-
gust for the Occupy protests. They
don't just disapprove of Occupy
Wall Street; they cannot stand
them. An open-minded 53 percent-
er thinks, in so many words, that
the protesters ought get out of the
streets and start looking for a job; a
more typical 53 percenter believes
that the protesters are ungrateful,
spoiled brats who leech off the rest
of society and spend their deodor-
ant money on drugs.
Another thing The 53% have in
common is a very peculiar notion
of what "taking money from, the
government" actually means. Some
of them claim to be,"scraping by

on minimum wage," which is odd
because that would put them back
among The Hated 47% that don't
owe any income taxes. Some of them
have been on welfare in its purest
sense: Food stamps to keep dinner
on the table or supplemental Social
Security assistance when they
were unable to work because of ill-
ness or injury. Many more describe
themselves as alumni of public uni-
versities. Many of them have been
in labor unions. And almost all of
them, I'm sure, have taken money
from "the government." The only
catch is that they took their hand-
outs from those programs that The
53% happens to think are OK:. Tax
deductions for interest paid against
your mortgage and tax credits for
supporting children.
But the most striking thing that
The 53% share is hardship. Some
have lost their jobs and claim to
have been evicted from their hous-
es. One is a single mother whose
child has been diagnosed with
Asperger's syndrome but can't
afford the needed therapy. One
young woman's father is working
12-hour days doing manual labor
despite battling cancer. The list -
and the suffering - goes on and on,
even if the saddest stories are some-
times hard to pick out in between
all the misplaced, self-righteous
piety.
Speaking of which, yes, even if
you're a police officer or a firefight-
er or a soldier, you're still a "public
employee."
It's odd these people identify
with The 53% because so many of
their lives are made measurably
and objectively worse by the SAE
pairing of corporate money and
influence with government authori-
ty that OWS is protesting. If a loved
one is battling cancer, it should
bother you that insurers have so
many ways they could cancel a
policy forthe crime of being sick. If

you're struggling to make payments
on your home, it should bother you
that lenders regularly commitfraud
by threatening people with foreclo-
sure even when they don't have the
legal authority to do so. It should
bother you that the largest banks in
America are free to walk away from
bad debts as good business sense,
but the idea that ordinary, every-
day people might do the same with
their mortgages and student loans
is taken to be a sign of ignorance
and moral sickness.
The 53% and the OWS protesters
They're angry
anyone would
protest at all.
likely have quite a bit in common.
The protestors are angry at the pat-
tern mutual glad-handing between
the wealthiest business interests
in America and the federal gov-
ernment that resulted in the worst
economy since the. Great Depres-
sion. The 53% are living proof of
just how bad the economy actually
is, but The 53% don't just disagree
with the protesters' criticism.
They're also angry - viscerally
angry - that anyone would dare to
protest at all.
I don't understand that impulse.
Thinking about it makes me angry,
actually. Thankfully, some intrepid
soul started a rival site, at actual-
lyyourethe47percent.tumblr.com.
Not much about The 53% makes a
whole lot of sense, but at least they
can provide a good, unintentional
laugh.

Dueling Viewpoints
College Republicans and College Democrats weigh in on
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's visit to campus today.

JOE SANDMAN 1

BRIAN KOZIARA

Anyone who has been follow-
ing the news over the past few
months knows that a complete
gridlock has taken over Washing-
ton. At the root of this problem
is a radical wing of the Republi-
can Party that spurns compro-
mise and acts with one guiding
principle: Thwarting President
Barack Obama at every turn.
These Republicans brought our
country close to a global financial
meltdown with their brinksman-
ship on national default, sought
to block Obama's health care plan
without pushing any of their own
alternatives and refuse to allow
Congress to vote on Obama's jobs
bill - even though many of them
have supported its components in
the past. House Majority Leader
Eric Cantor (R-Va.) epitomizes
much of this political chicanery.
Thisafternoon,Cantorisgiving
a lecture at the Michigan League.
Indeed, it is certainly an honor to
host a national political leader at
the University. More importantly,
though, the event should give stu-
dents insight into Cantor's radical
conservative ideology and will-
ingness to advance it at all costs.
In preparation for the event and
for the dialogue that will ensue on
campus, we offer five vignettes on
Cantor's time in Washington that
give insight into his vision, values
and priorities.
Our credit downgrade to AA+:
While Obama and some Republi-
can leaders sought a "grand bar-
gain" to reduce the deficit by $4
trillion and place our country on

a fiscally sustainable path, Can-
tor undermined the bipartisan
negotiations by refusing to com-
promise on his extreme anti-tax
ideology. His willingness to risk
national default for partisan gain
proved frightening; Standard &
Poor's cited political dysfunction
as a primary reason for our credit
downgrade.
Interfering with disaster aid:
When tornadoes, floods and hur-
ricanes devastated communities
across the country, Cantor tried
to make emergency assistance
contingent on cuts elsewhere in
the budget. It says something
about Cantor's priorities when
families that have lost their
homes and livelihoods must wait
for assistance until House Repub-
licans have finished their Wash-
ington-style bickering.
Comments about Occupy Wall
Street: Cantor recently referred
to the movement as "growing
mobs" and accused its support-
ers of "pitting Americans against
Americans." As a Tea Party
favorite who ought to understand
grassroots activism, it is particu-
larly disappointing that Cantor
would respond to legitimate con-
cerns about economic inequality
in this country with little more
than name-calling and allega-
tions of class warfare.
Ties to disgracedformer lobbyist
Jack Abramoff: Cantor accepted
thousands of dollars in campaign
contributions from Abramoff
and his affiliates. In 2006, after
the scope of Abramoff's corrup-

tion became public (including
his seeming efforts to influence
public officials with campaign
contributions, overseas golf trips
and expensive gifts), Cantor gave
about $10,000 of Abramoff-relat-
ed money to charity.
Taxpayer-funded self-promo-
tion: Cantor is producing a series
of new flashy videos, known as
"Snapshot of the Leader," for
his government website. While
the videos are certainly artsy,
they offer nothing in the way of
substantive policy information
that would further democratic
discourse. For someone bent on
cutting programs to reduce gov-
ernment spending, this video
series would seem like a good
place to start.
Cantor's lecture today will be
a fine opportunity for the Uni-
versity community to engage
in productive dialogue with an
influential political leader. As
the seemingly intractable grid-
lock continues in Washington,
though, students should remem-
ber that Cantor deserves a great
deal of credit for the refusals to
compromise, excessive partisan-
ship and ties to special interests
that have characterized politics
over the past two years and have
left so many Argericans frustrat-
ed with a system that seems to
disregard their interests.
Joe Sandman is a Ford
School of Public Policy senior.
This viewpoint was written on
behalf of the College Democrats.

This afternoon, the Ford
School of Public Policy will wel-
come House Majority Leader
Eric Cantor (R-Va.) to speak to
the University community and
share the latest from Capitol
Hill. As College Republicans,
we're proud of Cantor and all of
the good work that he has done
so far this term in Washington
D.C., along with Speaker of the
House John Boehner (R-Ohio),
Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy
(R-Calif.) and the entire Repub-
lican congressional caucus. From
rolling back job-killing regula-
tions to fighting tooth and nail to
prevent implementation of Presi-
dent Barack Obama's unconstitu-
tional health care law, Cantor has
been instrumental in providing
strong leadership for the Repub-
lican majority on Capitol Hill -
bringing together newly elected
Tea Party Republicans with
longtime veterans and harness-
ing the energy of a newly invigo-
rated conservative movement
and momentum from the 2010
midterm elections to promote a
governing vision that will create
jobs, encourage investment and
help restore our economy.
As the majority leader of the
U.S. House of Representatives,
Cantor has been influential in
setting the priorities of the 112th
Congress to focus on job creation,
reducing wasteful spending and
the size of the federal government
and protecting and promoting lib-
erty at home and abroad. Cantor's
key role in the debt ceiling and

deficit reduction talks this past
summer earned the respect of
many Republicans and Democrats
alike and proved vital to ensuring
that no new taxes will be raised
in order to balance our budget
Cantor understands the relation-
ship between government and
small business owners and under-
stands that raising taxes on small
businesses and wealthier Ameri-
cans isn't the fix to our economic
or budgetary woes. Rather, the
House majority leader is focused,
along with his fellow House
Republicans, on cutting wasteful
spending, removing burdensome
and unnecessary government
regulations and promoting poli-
cies that will benefit job creators
and get Americans back to work.
Cantor understands that it is only
through such policies that we
will be able to grow our economy
and reassert our strength as the
world's economic superpower
and the most competitive place to
do business.
There are some, however, who
do not agree with Cantor and the
House Republicans as they seek
to restore our economy and com-
bat the job-killing policies of the
Obama administration. There are
some who would rather see the
government take a bigger role in
the economy, bail out more com-
panies and impose job-killing
legislation on small business. And
unfortunately, there are those
who would likely rather protest
today or disrupt Cantor's event
instead of working together to

engage in a dialogue about job
creation and growing our econ-
omy.
House Republicans, led - by
Boehner and Cantor, have con-
tinually made overtures to the
Obama administration and tried
to work with Democrats in the
Senate to address the issue of
job creation. Time and time
again, Cantor has made an effort
to engage in dialogue, reach
across the aisle and find com-
mon sense, agreeable solutions to
our economic problems. Unfor-
tunately, it seems that the only
job Obama cares about saving is
his own. However, this has not
deterred Cantor and his fellow
House Republicans from mov-
ing forward with their vision for
a brighter future for America.
As one of the most dynamic and
creative leaders in the 112th
Congress, we remain confident
in Cantor's ability to come up
with creative solutions for today
and tomorrow's problems, move
forward with sound policies to
improve our economy and work
collaboratively and productive-
ly to provide leadership in the
House of Representatives for the
generation of tomorrow. We wel-
come Cantor to campus, applaud
him for his impressive achieve-
ments so far and extend our best
wishes for his continued success
in the future.

Council for Disability Concerns
recognizes Richard Bernstein

Muslim Students' Association
pairs up students for cultural
exchange 'Walk in my Shoes

Attorney, 'U'
lecturer awarded
for disability
awareness work
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
)aily StaffReporter
Though University alum and
attorney Richard Bernstein filed
a lawsuit against the University
several years ago, there were no
hard feelings on Friday when he
was honored for his work in dis-
ability awareness.
Bernstein, 55, received the
2011 James T. Neubacher award
from the University's Council
for Disability Concerns in front
of a crowd of about- 50 people
in the Rackham Assembly Hall
Friday morning. The award
- named after the University
alum, Detroit Free Press col-
umnist and disability advocate
- recognizes people who have
helped to promote disability
Bernstein, a 1996 graduate
and currently a University lec-
turer of political science, works
pro bono at The Sam Bernstein
Law Firm in Farmington Hills
to represent people with disabil-
ities. Bernstein, who is blind, is
most known for his efforts to
get the University to improve
accessible seating for people
with disabilities in Michigan
Stadium. He represented the
Michigan Paralyzed Veterans
of America in the 2007 case that
ruled that the University's reno-
vation plan for the Big House

because if you stop investing, then
you're just, you're dead," Coleman
said. "You're going to lose that spe-
cial feature, tthink we offer stu-
dents coming to Michigan."
But Slottow acknowledged that
next .year's market returns are
unpredictable.
"I don't expect this high level of
return ... to be the same next year,"
Slottow said.
In planning its budget, the Uni-
versity accounts for factors outside
of the investment office's control
- like the $47.5 million reduction
in state funding for the University
this academic year. Slottow said the
University was able to withstand
state budget cuts because it made
a conscious effort to cut costs and
increase fundraising efforts over
the last 10 years.
"The overall financial health of
the University at this moment is
quite strong," Slottow said. "That
having been said, it's a very, very
challenging environment because
of the state appropriation dropping
so precipitously."
Since 2010, the University's
operation costs have been cut by

was not in compliance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990. This
subsequently
led to the
development
of increased
handicap
accessible
seating areas,
in addition -
to advanced BERNSTEIN
accommoda-
tions for wheelchair users.
Jack Bernard, chair of the
University's Council for Disabil-
ity Concerns who presented the
award, praised Bernstein for his
efforts to make the University
community more aware of the
needs of people with disabilities.
"People cannot resist Rick
when he puts his mind and
effort into something," Ber-
nard said. "I think Rick is the
first recipient of the Neubacher
award to have sued the Univer-
sity of Michigan on-a disability
issue."
In his speech at the award
ceremony, Bernstein described
the strength and resolve of peo-
ple with disabilities.
"Folks who live life with a true
sense of adversity, they are given
the blessing of purpose," he said.
Bernstein lauded strives
that have been made in soci-
ety regarding the acceptance of
people with disabilities.
"When you see a disabled per-
son on an aircraft, or you see a
disabled person in your class or
when you see a disabled person
on a bus ... you don't even think
twice about it anymore," he said.
"We won. We've achieved what

we've set out to do."
At the event, the Council for
Disability Concerns also award-
ed members of the University
community for their work in
disability awareness.
University of Michigan-
Dearborn junior Rebecca
Parten received a certificate
of appreciation for founding
the Alliance for Disability
Awareness - a student group
at the University of Michigan-
Dearborn that spreads dis-
ability awareness. Parten has
Arthrogryposis, a congenital
disorder characterized by joint
deformities and neuromuscular
dysfunction, and said she per-
sonally feels the benefits of the
group's work.
"It's really cool to know that
there is a good, strong group
of people that recognized the
importance and need (for rais-
ing disability awareness),"
Parten said.
James H. Neubacher, the
father of the award's namesake,
attended this year's event with
his wife.
"It's a family," he said of the
disabled community. "There's a
sense of support and community
... people come here and they see
wonderful things that people
have been doing, and they get
energized by it."
But as Bernstein pointed
out, society's recognition and
accommodation of people with
disabilities is a gradual process.
"Change comes in painfully
slow methodical steps," Bern-
stein said. "But real change can
be true, genuine and ultimately
everlasting."

"Michigan football, as I know
it, is playing defense," Hoke said.
"First and foremost."
This isn't exactly Michigan
football as Hoke remembers
from his previous stint in Ann
Arbor. He and his trained robots
that come to the press conferenc-
es will be the first to tell you that.
The defense isn't at that level.
And no, it hasn't proven itself
against the best competition. But
it doesn't need to. Michigan plays
just one ranked team the rest of
the season. That's Nebraska, who
has to come to Ann Arbor.
Hoke wants to build a team
that has its defense win games.

And, to a large extent, it did so
on Saturday. Senior defensive
tackle Mike Martin's second-
quarter safety provided the turn-
ing point of the game. The play
made up for the defense giving
up a first-drive touchdown, and
it redeemed the offense after it
had thrown an interception at
Purdue's five-yard line.
In the third, Michigan was
stuffed at Purdue's goal line
on 4th-and-1. It was a playthat
could have derailed a season in
a game that traditionally did so.
(Do you want to be reminded
of the 2009 Illinois game when
Michigan was stopped on the
goal line ina similar fashion?
Oops, too late.) But thedefense
forced the Boilermakers to punt
on the next drive. Michigan

scored one drive later to go up 22
and put the game away.
"This defense is great with
responding to adversity, whether
it's a sudden change, whatever
it might be or we get scored on
which we never want that to
happen," Martin said. "But we
did a great job of comingto the
sideline and re-gathering (after
giving up the touchdown) and
knowing that we had to play bet-
ter defense. That's what we did."
Eight games into his tenure,
Hoke knows he has a defense
that can do what he needs it to
do.
That won't make his oppo-
nents breathe any easier.

about $100 million, according to
University Provost Philip Hanlon.
Between 2003 and 2009, the Uni-
versity saw about $135 million in
operation cost reductions.
"This is almost a decade-long
realfocus," Hanlon said.
Faculty salaries, financial aid,
facility operations, and mainte-
nance are among the University's
highest costs, according to Slottow.
The University's main sources of
revenue are tuition, state funding
and private donations.
The University of Michigan
Health System and federal grants
are other sources of revenue, Han-
lon said. He added that the Uni-
versity wants to avoid increasing
enrollment as a way toraise money
- a decision other universities have
made in recent years. However, the
University's Board of Regents have
voted to increase tuition in the last
few years.
The University raised tuition by
6.7 percent for in-state students
and 4.9 percent for out-of-state
students for the 2011-2012 aca-
demic year. Despite the size of the
endowment, in upcoming years
tuition will likely increase gradu-
ally - but not spike at once like
other universities including the
University of California system,
Slottow said.

Coleman said she and other Uni-
versity of Michigan officers have
had to make difficult choices to
keep the University in the top quar-
tile in investment returns among
universities across the country.
"I'm extremely pleased that we
continue to be very solid financial-
ly" Coleman said. "That represents
a lot of work by alot of people over
a long period of time."
Coleman and Hanlon recently
announced a new University ini-
tiative, the Michigan Investment
in New Technology Startups.
Through MINTS, the Univer-
sity will invest up to $25 million
- money from the University's
endowment - in faculty start-up
companies in the next 10 years.
Hanlon said MINTS is part of
the University's focus on diversi-
fying revenue streams, along with
cutting costs, as a way to maintain
financial health. The initiative is
the result of an investigation into
the University's investment strate-
gies over the last 20 years, which
revealed the University would have
had a comparable return on invest-
ments if the funds went into Uni-
versity start-ups.
"I think that we will continue to
focus on cost cutting, and no doubt
we will continue to focus on multi-
ple revenue streams," Hanlon said.


SHIRVELL
From Page 1A
amount of information during the
past year that shows that Deborah
Gordon has deliberately set out to
* destroy me by any means neces-
sary," Shirvell wrote. "It is particu-
larly shocking that an attorney like
Deborah Gordon, who has made a
career out of championing wrong-
fully-terminated employees, would
so viciously and maliciously inter-
fere with my employment in order
to ensure that I was terminated
from my job."
Shirvell was fired from his posi-
tion following a claim issued by
Gordon-that Shirvell had made
several homophobic remarks
against Armstrong - the first
openly gay MSA president - on his
blog "Chris Armstrong Watch."
Shirvell claimed on his blog that
Armstrong, who graduated this
past spring, was trying to instill
S a "radical homosexual agenda"
while leading MSA.
Shirvell, who recently moved to
New York, filed the federal lawsuit
in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Michi-
gan. Gordon is a resident of Michi-
gan, and the case will be based on
diversity 'jurisdiction, the press
release states.
Shirvell claimed in the release

that Gordon embarked on a "year
long campaign of intimidation and
defamation" against him.
Armstrong filed a lawsuit
against Shirvell in April that
alleges the former assistant attor-
ney stalked and defamed him.
The lawsuit requests damages in
excess of $25,000 and was filed
in the Washtenaw County Circuit
Court.
In April, Shirvell filed a coun-
tersuit against Armstrong for
allegedly inflicting personal and
economic damage against him for
aiding in his termination from
his position with the state. In
May, Shirvell subsequently filed a
motion to rescind various claim-
sArmstrong made against him
in the April lawsuit. The motion
sought to rescind claims of stalk-
ing, infliction of emotional dis-
tress, abuse of process, defamation
and one count of invasion of pri-
vacy.
"Unlike Mr. Armstrong, I have
suffered real economic dam-
age, including significant loss of
income, future earnings and the
right to enjoyment of my liveli-
hood," Shirvell wrote in a May 10
statement to The Michigan Daily.
"And, I have suffered those dam-
ages as a direct result of Mr. Arm-
strong's wrongful conduct. I look
forward to successfully litigating
my claims in the court."

Gordon told the Daily in May
that Shirvell's termination was
due to "wrong-doing on his part"
- citing examples such as using
his work computer to write his
blog and lying to former Attor-
ney General Mike Cox about his
behavior. Gordon said at the time
that Shirvell should rescind his
statements against Armstrong and
publicly apologize for his trans-
gressions.
"What Mr. Shirvell really needs
to do is take responsibility for
what he has done and the lies he
has published," Gordon said at the
time. "He needs to retract them,
he needs to apologize and he needs
to try to move on with his life."
In last night's press release,
Shirvell wrote that he anticipates
support for his suit against Gor-
don.
"Ms. Gordon needs to be held
accountable for her course of
conduct against me, which I find
beyond reprehensible," Shirvell
wrote. "No other member of the
State Bar of Michigan would ever
put up with what I have put up
with from Ms. Gordon over the
past year. I look forward to hold-
ing Deborah Gordon accountable
for her atrocious actions and libel-
ous statements."
Gordon and Shirvell could not
be reached for interviews as of 1
a.m. last night.

Overdose of'Rum'

'Margin' hits the jackpot

Stellar cast can't get
past the alcohol in
Caribbean-set film
By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer
When success eludes even the
most talented of men, the only
chance of sanity lies in a change
of scenery. For
Paul Kemp **
(Johnny Depp,
"Pirates of the The RUM
Caribbean"),
struggling writ-
er and chronic At Quality 16
alcoholic, this and Rave
change comes
in the form of FilmDistrict
Puerto Rico -
and what follows in the film is a
sweet amalgamation of every-
thing savage and seductive. Yet
the pandemonium of '60s Puerto
Rico, with its opportunistic expa-
triates, poverty-infested streets
and rum galore, yields a film too
caught up in the insanity of its
own premise to serve any sub-
stantial purpose.
Fresh from the "Pirates" series,
Depp returns to the Caribbean
with yet another intoxicating per-
formance, this time as an aspiring
journalist. But the journalist and
pirate-have one thing in common
an undisputed affection for
rumJWith two unfinished novels
and no significant career to his
name, Kemp has an unsurpris-
ing affinity for alcohol. What's
surprising is the sheer amount
consumed in the movie. From fin-
ishing 150 miniatures in his hotel
room to drinking "470 proof alco-
hol" - which apparently exists
- Kemp assures that "The Rum
Diary" lives up to its name.
Whenhe'snot drinking,Kemp's
out looking for a story that will
allow him to -be taken seriously,
as a journalist. Puerto Rico, how-
ever, has different plans. Kemp

"We're going to commandeer this motorcycle. Nautical term."

is soon tangled in a plethora of
distractions dispersed through-
out the island, like the beautiful
Chenault (Amber Heard, "Drive
Angry 3-D"). As the girlfriend of
businessman Sanderson (Aaron
Eckhart, "The Dark Knight"),
Chenault represents the elusive
blonde bombshell who captivates
every new soul in town. Heard
plays the part with ease, but her
vulnerable expressions quickly
become monotonous. Then again,
it's hard to stand out when you're
acting opposite Depp or the flaw-
less and convincingly egocentric
Eckhart.
Still, it's difficult to care for
any of the characters. Ultimately,
Puerto Rico and rum outshine the
brilliance of the actors. The script
skims the superficial end of com-
edy by offering some truly hilari-
ous moments and no context as
to why they're significant to the
plot.And the reason for this comic
relief is always the same - rum.
Kemp gets drunk, ventures into
some hostile part of Puerto Rico
and gets into trouble. When he's
not getting into trouble, he's get-
ting out of it, and we never know
why this is happening.
Kemp's discovery of injustices
being committed by Sanderson in

thesecondhalfofthe movieseems
like the light at the end of the tun-
nel. Finally, there's some reason
for his existence. Speculations
are made as to how he's going to
bring these injustices into the
spotlight. But no such thing hap-
pens. The movie ends as abruptly
as it started, and one walks out of
the theaterunfulfilled,wondering
what just happened. "The Rum
Diary" is like a roller coaster that
loses feeling just when it reaches
its peak.
It's a classic example of a film
that took so long to make that at
some point, director Bruce Rob-
inson ("Jennifer Eight") forgot
its purpose. The characters and
events drown in a sea of rum and
drugs, and even the grueling yet
enthralling streets of Puerto Rico
can't inspire the hazy premise
on which "The Rum Diary" was
based.When Depp, an actor who's
built his career on iconic charac-
ters like Edward Scissorhands
and Jack Sparrow, can't make the
audience care about Kemp, there's
obviously something wrong with
the movie.
In the end, "The Rum Diary" is
a forgettable tributeto the life and
work of Hunter S. Thompson and
leaves a lot to be desired.

At a key moment in "Mar-
gin Call," the recent Wall Street
thriller by newcomer J.C. Chan-
dor, Paul Bet-
tany's ("Priest")
character gazes
down from Margin Call
the ceiling of
a Manhattan At the
skyscraper, tee- Michigan
tering on the
brink of suicide. Lionsgate
As he decides
whether or not to follow through,
he states, "No one really cares
whether or not we die. The only
thing that actually matters is if we
fell or if we jumped."
The movie relies heavily on
these uniquely contemplative
periods of questioning to set the
tone for its view of Wall Street.
That view, heavily grounded in
the personalities of the people
behind the scenes, is surprisingly
sympathetic to the same guys
society has learned to despise. For
the first time, audiences experi-
ence the financial crisis through
eyes of the individuals who know-
ingly engineered it.
Unlike ever before, this is a
chance to see how they justified
it to themselves when no one else
was watching. And with that per-
sonal touch, the movie gets us - it
makes us care about the charac-
ters, no matter how greedy, inse-
cure or materialistic they may be.
The plot picks up in the early
stages of the 2008 recession as
an unnamed and fictional invest-
ment firm lays off 80 percent of
its workforce. One of the many
casualties is Eric Dale (Stanley
Tucci, "Captain America: The
First Avenger"), a risk analyst who
stumbles upon aseeminglyimper-
ceptible flaw in the firm's most
profitable investment package. As
he makes his way out of the build-
ing, he hands over his unfinished
work to coworker Peter Sullivan

How to open a TVshow

o directly contradict the
popular adage, I do judge
a television series by its
opening credits sequence. (I'm
pretty sure
that's how the
proverb goes.)
Forget such
meager crite-
ria as quality
writing and
acting - if a
show has a
stinker of an KAVI
opening cred- SHEKHAR

it might as
well not exist
(or should air on the CW, which
is essentially the same thing).
It's a true art form, find-
ing the perfect combination of
enthralling visuals and an audio
accompaniment to represent a
show for its entire run, which
can last a few episodes to several
seasons. Casts constantly change,
quality ebbs and flows, but other
than the title (sorry, "Cougar
Town") opening credits are one
of the things that stick to a show
forever.
Kickingoffa show with an
identical sequence, set to an
unforgettable song, is a conven-
tion imbued into our minds as
tykes. Give agreat big hug to
Mom and Dad, appreciating their
zen-like patience as you think
about the grating sing-a-long
openings of "Sesame Street" and
"Barney."
But it's the next wave of pro-
gramming that establishes the
opening credits to have both
memorable music and a taste of
what to expect from the show's
content. Recall the thunderously
riveting opening for "The Real
Adventures of Jonny Quest,"
swirling down a rabbit hole pep-
pered with glimpses of Jonny
and Hadji's greatest hits - with
a color scheme completely later
ripped off by "The Matrix" - and
the haunting, doom-and-gloom
orchestration that foreshadows
the tragic genius of "Dexter's
Laboratory."

FILMMAKER INTERVIEW
Emmerich and Orloff talk 'Anonymous'

New film seeks out
true Shakespeare
authorship
By PHILIP CONKLIN
DailyArts Writer
Was Shakespeare a fraud?
Since the middle of the 19th
century, important thinkers like
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt
Whitman, Mark Twain and Sig-
mund Freud have questioned
whether "the man from Strat-
ford" is in fact responsible for the
revered Shakespearian corpus,
and books on the Shakespeare
authorship debate have proposed
countless potential authors.
This question is also on the
poster of "Anonymous," the most
recent entry into the Shakespeare
authorship debate. The film,
from German director Roland
Emmerich ("2012") argues that
Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of
Oxford, wrote Shakespeare's
plays.
"We don't know who William
Shakespeare was," said the film's
writer John Orloff, in an exclu-
sive interview with The Michigan
Daily. "We know nothing about
this man. And when you read that
800-page biography, you're really
reading one page of facts and 799
pages of guesses."
Emmerich shares Orloff's ("A
Mighty Heart") suspicions about
the whether the Shakespeare of
history is the author of the works.
"It is four hundred years ago,
and there is very little known
about these people, and what is
known is probably edited and alot.
of documents were purposefully
destroyed so that people wouldn't
find out the truth," Emmerich
said in the same interview.
The road to getting this film

made was long and arduous. Orl-
off first learned about the Shake-
speare authorship debate about
20 years ago through an episode
of the PBS show "Frontline," after
which he wrote the first draft of
"Anonymous."
"Sadly, two months later,
'Shakespeare in Love' came out,"
Orloff said. "So nobody wanted
to make another Shakespearean
drama."
It wasn't until five years later,
in a meeting with Emmerich
that the idea gained momentum.
Emmerich, who knew next to
nothing about Shakespeare or the
debate, did extensive research
after reading the script. What
resulted is a story of political
intrigue revolving around the
Essex Rebellion and the succes-
sion of Elizabeth I, intertwined
with the narrative of the origin
and true author of the works of
Shakespeare.
"Suddenly, our film became
this Shakespearean drama," Orl-
off said. "In the sense of, it's about
incest, it's about uncrowned
princes. It's about all the things
Shakespeare talks about in his
plays."
However, even after the script
was finalized; they encountered
resistance in trying to finance
the film, because of Emmerich's
past work. As the director of
such sci-fi spectacles as "Inde-
pendence Day" and "The Day
After Tomorrow," Emmerich's
work with "Anonymous" marked
a departure from his usual style.
But it was a departure the direc-
tor welcomed.
"It's really not easy to make
these huge tent-pole mov-
ies because of all the money
involved. They're incredibly com-
plicated, you're under time pres-
sure," Emmerich said. "I was a
little bit frustrated too because

you get pigeonholed as a master
of disaster, but you're actually
quite a normal person who's not
constantly running around trying
to destroy the world. I just do that
because it's what genre I was suc-
cessful in."
Despite the studio's reluc-
tance to let him direct, Emmerich
found a way to get the film made,
and to get it made cheaply.
One advantage of Emmerich's
miniscule budget was that he
could cast the film as he wanted.
The result is a cast of relatively
unknown English actors. But the
lack of familiar faces does not
discourage Emmerich, who, in
his casting process, tried to be as
open as possible to find the best
players.
One face American audiences
might recognize is Rhys Ifans
("Greenberg"), who plays Edward
de Vere, the film's protagonist.
Better known for comedic roles,
Ifans was an unlikely choice for
such a weighty part. But his audi-
tion surprised Emmerich.
"He was assuming that he was
doing Shakespeare, whose char-
acter is a bit like the fool in our
film," Emmerich said. "And he
said, 'Yeah, you've probably got
me here for William Shakespeare,
but I'd love to play the Earl of
Oxford.' And I probably made an
astonished face."
But after doing some research,
Emmerich found that Ifans was
an underappreciated dramatic
actor. Emmerich said he also real-
ized Ifans was similar to de Vere,
a nobleman who is banned from
writing the plays that he loves
and cannot accept the acclaim he
is due.
"Howperfectisthat,youknow,
a man who is misunderstood in
his work in real life - that's also
why he could so deeply empa-
thize with this character," Emm-

"Anonymous" director Roland Emmerich is known for "Independence Day" and "2012."

erich said. "He put alot of himself
and his frustration in this part."
In casting and portraying the
film's characters, Emmerich and
Orloff had to tread a thin line
between historical accuracy and
dramatic energy. It was also more
important for Orloff to write a
film with a gripping narrative,
rather than simply answer the
film's tagline.
"It's not a documentary," Orl-
off said. "It's fun to talk about
the authorship debate, but that's
not what the movie's about. If
the movie were really about the
authorship debate, it would be a
mystery."
"Ultimately, I hope it's about
compelling characters that you
become interested in, like any
other film," he added. "This isn't
a history lesson, this movie. It's

a movie, it's supposed to be fun,
you're supposed to enjoy your-
self."
Though the film is clear in its
position on the authorship ques-
tion, the filmmakers aren't pros-
elytizing.
"I want people to think about
it, though," Orloff said. "We don't
try to convince you in the movie.
The movie takes it as a given that
this is what happened."
However, Emmerich recog-
nizes that the film might provoke
some controversy in the academic
community. Orloff also recog-
nizes the potential controversy,
especially from the Stratfordian
movement - those who believe
the man from Stratford wrote
Shakespeare's works.
"Well they're upset. They're
very, very upset. They're really,

really angry," Orloff said. "I think
art should provoke. That's the
purpose of art. If it's not provok-
ing, if it's not engendering conver-
sation, then, as I say in the film,
it's just decoration."
The film will certainly stir
passionate reactions from both
sides of the debate with its strong
views on this contentious subject
and unflattering portrayal of the
Shakespeare character, who Orl-
off called the "stock Shakespear-
ean fool."
And it's a debate that Orloff rel-
ishes.
"What we are trying to do is
open up a discussion, and tell
people, 'Well, you should think
about this - this is interesting,"'
he said. "Maybe you'll come to the
same conclusion we did, which is:
this might be true."

Toussaint collects 170
yards and two touchdowns
as lead running back
By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
Hooting and hollering, the Michigan foot-
ball team sprinted up the tunnel exiting the
Big House. The uphill slope burned, but the
players were too excited not to run. Their
screams echoed off the walls.
Somewhere in the crowd was redshirt
sophomore running back Fitz Toussaint, the
running back who may have - at long last -
claimed his seat as Michigan's lead back.
Left tackle Taylor Lewan walked with a
slight limp with his arm around Denard Rob-
inson's shoulder. Lewan tweaked his knee in
pregame warmups then badly limped off the
field in the third quarter but didn't miss a
snap.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke was pick-
ing left guard Ricky Barnum's brain as they
brought up the rear. Barnum re-injured his
ankle midway through the game and couldn't
return. At guard, Michael Schofield and Pat-
rick Omameh stepped in, and stepped up.

Lewan, Schofield, Omameh, center Dave
Molk and right tackle Mark Huyge paved the
way for arguably the best running back per-
formance since 2009, as Toussaint ran for 170
yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries.
As a team, the Wolverines played "Michi-
gan football" and bullied Purdue, 36-14, simi-
lar to how they were bullied two weeks ago
against Michigan State.
"I think nationally, people think about
Michigan football and playing defense, then
running the football," Hoke said. "Being able
to run the football and knock people off the
line of scrimmage. And soI think, that's what,
in my mind, Michigan football is."
Michigan's defense was considered stout
this year - until Northwestern and Michigan
State showed the world the Wolverines were
weak on the perimeter.
Purdue followed Michigan State's lead. On
the Boilermakers' first drive, wide receiver
Gary Bush took a bubble screen 48 yards for a
touchdown - it was the first 40-plus yard play
the Michigan defense had allowed all season.
But Michigan's emphasis on technique
paid off, and Purdue punted on five of its next
seven possessions. The sixth ended in a Mike
Martin safety - which was Michigan's first

Fifth-year senior

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
It's hard to overstate the differ-
ence defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison has made on the Michi-
gan football team through eight
games.
In the past 10 months, the Wol-
verines evolved from one of the
worst defenses into a depend-
able, sometimes dominant corps.
In Saturday's 36-14 victory over
Purdue, the defense caused a
red-zone turnover, a safety and a
turnover on downs.
After the defense allowed a
swift opening-drive touchdown,
capped by a 48-yard touchdown
reception - the longest play
allowed by Michigan all season -
fifth-year senior defensive tackle
Mike Martin took control of the
game.
Lined up at his own five-yard
line, Purdue quarterback Caleb
TerBush took a snap from under
center. Before TerBush dropped
back three steps, Martin had
brushed past Boilermaker guard
Peters Drey ready for the kill shot.

in the F;
Michigan football team's 36-14
win over Purdue on Saturday,
Michigan redshirt junior safety
Jordan Kovacs watched from
the sidelines, nursing a knee
injury he suffered in practice
earlier in the week.

It was an unexpected sight.
Kovacs's injury hadn't been
released to the media until an
hour before kickoff.
During the team's practice
Tuesday, which was open to the
media, it appeared that Kovacs,
No. 32, was participating.
No. 32 was indeed playing.
But Kovacs was not.
According to sources, Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke had
redshirt junior safety Matt
Cavanaugh, normally No. 28,
dress as No. 32. This wasn't an

early Halloween costume. This
was practice. It's unsure wheth-
er Cavanaugh's number switch
was to hide the Kovacs injury or
to impersonate Purdue starting
safety Albert Evans, who wears
No. 32,on the scout team.
Either way, when asked about
injuries throughout the week,
Hoke remained tight-lipped on
the situation, continually saying
his team was healthy. He didn't
want people to know about
Kovacs - and for good reason.

wants to see.
Martin powered through
Drey's last attempt to block him
and dropped TerBush two yards
deep in the end zone for a safety,
giving Michigan a 9-7 lead early
in the second quarter.
"(The safety) was a great
momentum (boost)," said Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke. "When
you score defensively it always
brings great momentum and
morale for your team."
Nine minutes later, Martin

added another sack, giving him
a career-high two sacks for the
afternoon - matching his season-
long totals for his freshman and
sophomore seasons.
"That guy is a physical beast,"
said junior defensive end Craig
Roh of Martin. "He's a physically
dominating player."
Martin and the defensive line
needed the bounce-back perfor-

The legend of the Rocketman

ric Scott gripped the
handles on his jet pack,
waiting in the southeast
corner of the concourse, just out-
side Michigan Stadium's bowl.
Scott had never stepped foot
inside the Big House. His friend
had to tell him that the stadium
was even called the Big House.
But he had
the famous
Michigan
wings on his,
helmet and a
huge block 'M'
on his back.
Growing up
on a small TIM
ranch in Hel- ROHAN
ena, Mont.,
Scott didn't
have time
to watch football. There wasn't
enough time to watch TV, par-
ticularly on the weekends.
He'd wake up, feed the horses,
clean the chicken coops - maybe
kill a chicken, if his family needed
him to. In the fall, Scott and his.
four siblings were busy preparing
for the cold winter months. As he
put it, "TV was a privilege."
"There weren't a lot of pro
sports in Montana," he said. "And
for college, I probably would've
rooted for the Montana State Uni-
versity Bobcats. But they always
kind of sucked anyways. ... It
wasn't anything like Michigan."
Now, he was about to surprise
the 100,000-plus people seated
inside. They'd only remember
Rocketman for the 25 seconds he
spent streaking through the air,
inviting the usual did-you-see-
that or jet-packs-are-so-freaking-
cool comments. Always a very
calculated man, Scott wasn't
nervous for this flight. Nearly 19
years of flying his jet pack had
prepared him. It didn't bother
him that he didn't havea "prayer-
shute." He never had one.
"I just have to remember plan
B, which is don't fuck up plan A,"
Scott said.
He didn't have a planB when
he made a mistake during his
training in 1993. During a flight,,
he was about 40 feet in the air
when he made a critical mistake,
pushing the jet pack too hard.
It started shooting down - 60
miles per hour, righttowards

the ground. Luckily, he thought
enough to turn the jet pack off a
few feet from the ground. Still,
his shoulder had tobe recre-
ated. His knee was busted up.
Six months after the accident, he
went back and found pieces of
himself in the asphalt. It takes a
certain type of person to fly a jet
pack. Scott was always that type
of person.
"I grew up out in the country,
so there wasn't a lot for entertain-
ment, soI was always blowing
something up," Scott said. "Just
doingsomething stupid. Riding
my dirt bike and pulling off some
crazy stuff.... That's the story of
my life, I guess."
After high school, he joined the
Air Force, where he was a Para-
rescue special operations team
member for four years. His job
was simple, save "anybody from
anywhere in the world."
Oceans, valleys, cliffs. Behind
enemy lines. Anywhere. If some-
one needed a ride home, Scott
and his team provided it. Four
years later, he was starting his
family and found a less intense
job in construction. But by 1990,
a friend helped him get into show
business. There was a market for
people who worked in the mili-
tary because they made for great
stunt doubles. That same friend
introduced Scott to Kinnie Gib-
son, who was working at the time
as Chuck Norris's stunt double on
"Walker Texas Ranger." Gibson
was also one of the few people
who knew how to fly a jet pack.
And he was the first person in the
world to make a business out of it.
Gibson got Scott a part on Walker
Texas Ranger, where Scott usu-
ally played Bad Guy No. 1, 2 or 3.
"(I'm) usually always getting
my butt kicked," Scott said.
"I got to beat (Norris) up once.
But that was out of like 60 epi-
sodes I was in, in eight years."
In his spare time, Gibson did
promotional work with his jet
pack. He had asked Scott's mutu-
al friend if he'd be interested in
filling in when Gibson was too
busy. But the friend wasn't the
right kind of person. So Gibson
asked Scott. Scott's first impres-
sion of the jet pack was that the
pilots always made it look so easy.
"People call them jet packs -

Michigan wins
eighth Big Ten
championship

they're rocket packs, if you will,"
Scott said. "In the military, we
called them rocket belts."
Scott had never flown one
before Gibson taught him every-
thing he needed to know in a
three-month span in 1993. Gibson
had taught himself how to fly it
after he found it covered in dust
in a Bell Technologies lab in 1981.
Nelson Tyler, the inventor of the
jet pack, had built it, but even he
didn't fully know how to control
it.
"There's nothing easy about
it," said Scott, who's now fully
employed by Gibson's "Rocket-
man" business. "It's a total finesse
thing, and you have to learn not
to be too excited, too anxious.
"You find your mind racing
harder and faster than anything
you've ever experienced in your
life. If you've ever done a sport,
this thing is..."
His voice trailed.
"You know, I don't like saying
it, but if you're riding a bicycle
and fall off, it's not like falling out
of the sky. ... Some people work
well under pressure."
Scott was a pro by the time
Smirnoff called in 2004, look-
ing for a pilot to help promote its
new bottle label. In London, Scott
flew 152 feet in the air - a Guin-
ness World Record - getting high
enough to land on a 10-foot-by-10-
foot platform atop a castle turret.
In 2007, he set the speed record
when he reached 80 miles per
hour. Then, in 2009, he met a
"personal challenge," when he
crossed a 1,000-foot deep gorge
- the same chasm the 1,500-foot
Royal Gorge Bridge spans in Colo-
rado.

Standing outside Michigan
Stadium, Scott felt comfortable
with the 85-pound machine on
his back. Thirty pounds of force
were about to be exerted on his
hands. Scott compared the feeling
to standing on top of a ball, trying
to balance yourself, with two fire
hoses turned on. But there was no
reason to panic.
The PA announcer boomed,
"Presenting today's Homecom-
ing 2011 game ball, ROCKET-
MAN."
Scott shot straight up into the
air, appearing just above the mas-
sive luxury suites in the south-
east corner. The stadium erupted,
but Scott couldn't hear a thing.
Up that high, above the stadium,
Scott looked out and enjoyed his
view of Ann Arbor. Then he head-
ed towards the student section -
and fast. Everyone in the stadium
who was first witnessing Rocket-
man didn't know he was in con-
trol. But Scott smoothly turned
and glided towards the block 'M'
at the SO-yard line.
"When you land, there's all that
noise (from the jet pack), then
when it shuts off there's silence,"
Scott said.
For every one of his 15 to 30
flights he takes each year, it's
always the same.
"Then you hear the crowd
screaming for me," he continued.
"It one-upped every show that
I've done before. It just keeps get-
ting better every time. It was (my)
pleasure."
No, Mr. Rocketman. Thank
you.

The No. 7 Michigan field
hockey team clinched the out-
right Big Ten regular seasontitle
with a 4-2 victory over Indiana
on Friday.
The vic- INDIANA 2
tory MICHIGAN 4
marks the
second- STANFORD 3
straight MICHIGAN 0
confer-
ence title for Michigan and the
eighth overall in the program's
history.
The title is also the first in all
of Michigan athletics in the fall
season.
"I love trophies, I love for
our student athletes to leave
here with championship rings,"
said Michigan Athletic Director
Dave Brandon.
Added Michigan coach Mar-
cia Pankratz: "They worked so
hard all season. I'm just so proud
to win a championship for Mich-
igan."
Pankratz has coached seven
of the program's eight champi-
onship teams.
Sophomore forward Rachael
Mack, the team's leading scor-
er, scored the game-winning
goal. The contest was tied 1-1 at
halftime after freshman Emy
Guttman scored off a pass from
sophomore Ainsley McCallister
in the 21st minute.
The score did not remain
tied for long, as Mack scored
her 12th goal of the season off a
pass from senior Eileen Brandes
26 seconds into the second half.
Brandes would record her sec-
ond assist of the game in the
65th minute when senior Jess
Allen scored her second goal of
the season to put the game out of
reach at 4-2.
Though both Indiana and
Michigan tallied seven shots
each in the second half, Michi-
gan had eight penalty corners

compared to four for Indiana.
Michigan took advantage of
closer shots on net and scored
three goals in the final frame.
"Today was a tough one, and
we squeaked it out, and I'm real-
ly proud of them," Pankratz said.
On senior day on Sunday, the
Wolverines (5-1 Big Ten, 13-5
overall) fell to No. 9 Stanford,
3-0. The defeat was Michigan's
fourth non-conference loss of
the year.
Despite outshooting Stanford
10-3 in the first half and 9-2 in
the second half, Michigan was
held scoreless. Many of the Wol-
verines' shots were off target or
further away than their chances
were against Indiana. Only nine
of Michigan's 14 shots were on
net.
The result was simple: Michi-
gan's shots were consistently
deflected and saved by Stanford
senior goalie Ale Moss, who
recorded her sixth shutout of the
season.
"I think we need to be more
aggressive," Mack said. "We
didn't possess the ball as well as
we should have. We need to bring
a mental intensity to our next
game."
With a large presence of Stan-
ford fans in the stands, the Cardi-
nal (15-2 overall) took a 1-0 lead
with seconds left in the first half
off a corner. Sophomore Hope
Burke scored from the left side
of the post off a pass from junior
Becky Dru, who assisted on the
second goal as well, before scor-
ing the third herself.
The loss ended Michigan's
eight-game home win streak.
"We have to keep playing,
we've been doing it all year," Pan-
kratz said. "We just didn'ttoday."
By winning the regular season
Big Ten title, Michigan receives
a first-round bye in the confer-
ence tournament at Penn State
in Happy Valley. The Wolverines'
first game in the playoffs will be
Friday.

Hunwick proves himself
as best goaltender on ice

ALDEN REISS/Daily
The Wolverines celebrate one of their four goals against goalie C.J. Motte in a 4-0 win on Friday night at Yost Ice Arena.
'M'sweeps home series

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
The Ferris State hockey team
came into Yost Ice Arena on a
roll. The Bulldogs swept perenni-
al power Miami (Ohio) the previ-
ous weekend and rose all the way
up to No. 6 in the polls.
Fer-
ris State's FERRIS STATE 2
defense MICHIGAN 5
was doing
it all, allow- FERRIS STAT E0
ing just MICHIGAN 4
five goals
through six games, including
three shutouts.
But then the Bulldogs came to
Ann Arbor. On Thursday night,
No. 4 Michigan doubled Ferris
State's goals allowed season total
en route to a 5-2 victory.
Friday was supposed to be
different for the Wolverines,
though, with freshman goalten-
der C.J. Motte in net for the Bull-
dogs. Motte had allowed only one
goal all year, sitting pretty with a
.986 save percentage. Yawn.
Michigan (2-1-1 CCHA, 6-1-1
overall) blew past Ferris State
(2-2-0, 6-2-0) again on Friday
night, continuing its offensive
explosion and sweeping the Bull-
dogs with a 4-0 victory.
"It's a good weekend for us,"

said Michigan coach Red Beren-
son. "Those are games we had to
have. We had to establish ourself
at home and get back in the con-
ference race. I think we took a
step this weekend."
On Friday night, Michigan
struck first in the first peri-
od when sophomore forward
Derek DeBlois slid a backward,
between-the-legs pass to fresh-
man forward Alex Guptill, who
buried the shot in the top right
corner of the net.
After that, the Wolverines
were off to the races, scoring
three goals in the second period.
Offensively, Michigan moved
the puck, didn't try to beat any-
one one-on-one and waited
patiently for a chink in the armor
to present itself. The Wolver-
ines didn't force anything in the
offensive zone, but instead wait-
ed for rebounds and open scoring
opportunities.
Michigan's third goal of the
game came on a rebound off a
breakaway that junior forward
A.J. Treias cleaned up with
Motte on his back from two pre-
vious saves. A goalie is only able
do so much, and the Wolverines
never let up on Motte.
Earlier in the week, Beren-
son talked about beating a good
defensive team with even bet-

ter defense. Goals allowed are
even more valuable when scor-
ing chances on the other end are
limited. Leading up to the game
against the tough Ferris State
defense, Michigan wasn't focus-
ing on its offense. Instead, Michi-
gan was focusing on its defense.
Berenson got what he was
looking for in senior netminder
Shawn Hunwick, who recorded
24 saves in Michigan's second
shutout of the season on Friday.
Hunwick seemed locked in
from the very beginning, never
ceding an inch. Ferris State didn't
score on seven power-play chanc-
es. It also helped that four close
shots hit off the post - there's
nothing wrong with a little luck.
Scoring nine goals in two
games against anyone is impres-
sive, but doing it against Ferris
State's defense is a great sign for
a young offense that had so many
question marks enteringthe year.
With six freshmen getting sig-
nificant playing time, not even
Berenson knew how the offense
was going to play early on in the
season. So far, there hasn't been
an issue.
"(The freshmen) are just fill-
ing in for what we lost," Brown
said. "That's kind of what Michi-
gan does. We don't lose, we just
reload."

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
Ferris State goaltender Taylor
Nelson failed to get the job done
in Michigan's series-opening 5-2
win over the Bulldogs on Thurs-
day. So all eyes were on his fresh-
man understudy C.J. Motte the
next night. Motte had one task:
shut down a Wolverine offense
fresh off a five-goal performance.
No one was happier to kindly
escort Motte from the spotlight
than Michigan's fifth-year senior
netminder Shawn Hunwick.
After the 4-0 victory on Fri-
day to sweep the series, Hun-
wick highlighted how important
a shutout can be - not just for
his morale, but for the team's as
well.
"It's a team thing, too," Hun-
wick said. "It's ahuge confidence
booster for everyone in the lock-
er room knowing we can go up
against a CCHA team and give
up nothing."
Michigan coach Red Berenson
likes to talk about "puck luck" -
the hockey gods' way of altering
the outcome on the ice.
Several times on Friday, it
looked as if the sixth-ranked
Bulldogs were ready to strike.
And when a few of their shots
found metal, not nylon, the
crowd's sighs of relief empha-
sized that "puck luck" was on the
fourth-ranked Wolverines' side.
"The goal posts, obviously,
were in our favor tonight,"
Berenson said. "(Hunwick)
played really well. The puck
didn't go in for them but it went
in for us."
Hunwick, too, was quick to
dismiss his 24-save performance
as little more than fortunate.
"I actually had probably one
of my worst games tonight,"
Hunwick said Friday. "Those
(shots off the posts) could have

ALDEN REISS/Daily
Fifth-year senior Shawn Hunwick made 24 saves in a series-clinching 4-0
shutout on Friday.

been game changers. Sometimes
it's better tobe lucky than good."
But Hunwick's role in the
second shutout of the season
for Michigan (2-1-1 CCHA, 6-1-1
overall) and its first sweep of
Ferris State since February 2009
cannot be overstated. With a
young defense skating in front of
Hunwick, Berenson mentioned
how crucial having an experi-
enced goaltender can be.
"I don't think he's ever been
in this kind of a role," Berenson
said. "He's such an important
player on the team and now he's
got to act like it. He knows that."
The Bulldogs (2-2, 6-2) are
now left to hope that the early
season play of their goaltenders
wasn't a fluke after deep attacks
like ones from the Wolverines
have made them appear vulner-
able.
But Hunwick was still

impressed with the performance
of Motte, who isstill adjusting to
the rigors of college hockey and
the unwelcoming home crowds
that await him in the CCHA.
"I thought he looked good,"
Hunwick said of Motte, whose
younger brother, Tyler, has com-
mitted to Michigan for 2013.
"Coming into Yost as a visitor is a
hard thing to do. The fans are all
over you. I'm just happy they're
on my side."
Junior forward Chris Brown
thinks no other goalie in the
country can provide the instant
boost that Hunwick is capable
of giving with a timely save or
clutch block.
"Our goalie is going to play
and stand on his head every
night," Brown said.
And for the Wolverines, that's
a talent that hardly goes unno-
ticed.

Wolverines shut down
Ferris State's seven
power-play chances
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan coach Red Berenson has
been pleasantly surprised by many fac-
ets of his team's perfor-
mance this season, with NOTEBOOK
the exception of one
thing - the number of penalties Michigan
has amassed.
In Friday's game against Ferris State
the Wolverines took every type of penalty
imaginable from elbowing and tripping
to face-washing, a call that earned junior
forward Lee Moffie a five-minute major.
Michigan spent more than a third of the
game in the penalty box - plenty of time
for the penalty kill to get some practice.
"(The penalty kill) was important,"
Berenson said. "We got some luck, and I
thought our penalty killers were better."
The defensive corps led by senior
defenseman Greg Pateryn, shut down
seven Bulldog power-play opportunities.
But no one led the penalty kill unit more
than than fifth-year senior goalie Shawn
Hunwick, who ensured the Michigan
shutout.
And it wasn't just Hunwick's physical
skills that kept the Bulldogs from scoring
on Friday - his emotional skills played a
big role too.
Since his ejection against Northern
Michigan, Hunwick has made extra effort

to stay away from any scuffles around the
net.
The teams exchanged shoves around
the crease multiple times on Friday, and
referees had to separate Michigan and
Bulldog players more than once.
While his teammates went to the pen-
alty box, Hunwick just sat quietly in his
net, waiting for the altercations to end.
"I learned my lesson from last week,"
Hunwick said. "It wasn't like Ferris State
was coming at me. I didn't get bumped too
much, so that was alright."
THUMBS UP: Berenson has been care-
ful to keep some players off the ice to
recover from injuries.
Junior forward Kevin Lynch sat out
early games because of back problems,
and Berenson made sure to keep him
away from game action until the spasms
stopped.
But junior forward Chris Brown's bro-
ken thumb hasn't kept him out of games.
All season, he has shoved his cast into his
glove and skated as if he were as healthy
as anyone else.
Brown's cast keeps his hand in a
thumbs-up position. This optimistic
gesture reflects the positive impact that Junior fort

RUNNING GAME
From Page 1B
safety since 2003. The seventh
ended in an interception.
Maybe even more impres-
sive is that this came without
redshirt junior safety Jordan
Kovacs, who missed the game
due to a knee injury.
"I don't think that we played
near as physical inside with
our offensive line," said Pur-
due coach Danny Hope, whose
words sounded exactly like
Hoke's after his team lost 28-14
against Michigan State.
"Michigan has a very big
strong defensive front, and we
didn't manufacture much run
game inside, and I thought that
slowed us down some."
Sounds like Michigan foot-
ball. What about the offense?
From the first snap of the
game - when Toussaint sprint-
ed for 15 yards - it was clear
Michigan would be able to run
the ball. Meanwhile, Robinson
found his groove in the short-to-
intermediate passing game, con-
sistently finding open receivers.
Borges continued to sprinkle in
Devin Gardner at quarterback,
but he yielded mediocre results.
Robinson's lone intercep-
tion came on the second drive
when he didn't account for Pur-
due linebacker Joe Holland,
who jumped a short pass. On
the day, Robinson completed
9-of-14 passes for 170 yards,
but was aided by 91 yards via
two deep passes in which both
wide receivers, Jeremy Gallon
and Roy Roundtree, made great

efforts.
Ultimately, Robinson took a
backseat in the offense because
the only sure thing was Tous-
saint and the offensive line.
After Robinson and Gardner
ended back-to-back drives with
interceptions, and after Martin
rejuvenated the defense with
his safety, Borges abandoned the
tricks. He abandoned Robinson.
He abandoned Gardner.
He just fed Toussaint the ball,
running the power play down
the Boilermakers' throats.
The oft-injured tailback
looked refreshed and rejuve-
nated. After the game, he said
he was able to get off his feet and
get treatment to "help heal his
body" during the bye.
Toussaint's 20 carries on the
afternoon were the most for a
Michigan running back since
2009. His 8.5 yards per carry
was Denard Robinson-esque.
The offense finally revolved
around a power running game,
and maybe in particular, a pow-
erful offensive line.
"Sometimes we're a little - I
don't want to say tentative - but
it looked like on film we did not
get it done," Hugye said. "We
needed to go out and play as hard
as we could."
Martin pointed to the physi-
cal practices the Wolverines
had during their bye week as a
reason for the offensive line's
improvement. Despite Lewan
being hobbled and Barnum's
absence, the line helped fuel 339
rushing yards.
The performance was that
much more powerful, consider-
ing Hoke publicly challenged

the unit after the Michigan State
game.
Taking the pressure off Rob-
inson, Toussaint added the
exclamation mark on his domi-
nant game midway through the
third quarter. Gardner faked a
handoff to Robinson and pitched
the ball to Toussaint.
Two linemen had already
sealed off a few defenders down-
field, allowing Toussaint to run
free. The shifty back bounced
inside and looked for daylight.
He sidestepped another defend-
er who over-pursued, then
another and finally charged
up field, slipping between two
defenders. Fifty-nine yards later,
Michigan led 29-7.
After the game, Toussaint
praised the offensive line and
Hoke praised the receivers
blocking down field. That was
Michigan football.
Together, Martin said, the
offense and defense are starting
to "complement" one another.
"Offensively, them holding
onto the ball, time of possession,
putting points of the board," he
said. "And then us, getting the
ball back to the offense."
Leading up to this game,
unsolicited, Hoke kept repeating
that the Wolverines had to "get
back to playing Michigan foot-
ball." His words must've been
echoing between their ears, like
their cheers in the tunnel after
the game.
The defense was on its way.
Finally, the runninggame looked
the part too.
"Gosh I wish - I wish it
looked like that every week,"
Hoke said.

23 Michigan State. In that game,
the Spartans exposed gaping
holes at the line of scrimmage
and rushed for 213 rushing
yards.
Against the Boilermakers, the
Wolverines collected four sacks
and held the running backs to 89
yards.
And three Michigan linemen
finished in the top five for tack-
les. It was a game won up front.
"They're real big, and they're
real strong and they do a great
job of penetrating the line of
scrimmage," said Purdue coach
Danny Hope. "We knew coming
into the game they were a big
strong defensive front. There's
no question about that. You can
look at them and see."
After allowing the opening-
drive touchdown, the defense
held Purdue scoreless for the
next 58 minutes.
According to Hoke and his
players, it was all about get-
ting back to good old-fashioned

Michigan football.
"Michigan football as I know
it is playing defense," Hoke said.
Holding Purdue scoreless for
nine consecutive drives certain-
ly looked like textbook Michi-
gan defense, but what exactly
does that look like?
"Michigan defense is domi-
nating in every aspect of life,"
Roh said with a smile. "That's a
rough definition."
Speaking a little less tongue-
in-cheek, Martin pointed to
stopping the run as the staple of
a Michigan defense he expects
to see every Saturday.
Hoke holds the belief that
there are between six and eight
individual plays that determine
the outcome of each game. The
safety was one. Sophomore cor-
nerback Courtney Avery's red-
zone interception was another.
But another crucial play
occurred late in the game, when
Purdue quarterback Robert
Marve hit a short screen pass.
Martin was on the pass rush, but
instead of stopping his pursuit of
the play when Marve let the pass
fly, Martin went on the hunt.

Martin caught his man 16
yards downfield.
Did that play determine the
outcome of the game? Maybe
not. But the effort was all that
mattered.
"I think it sets the tone for
the defense," Hoke said. "When
you see a guy who's lining up
over the football and rushing
the passer ... and 16 yards down
the field he's making the tackle
- that means somethig'."
Martin ended the game with
a season-high seven tackles.
Even with the win and a 7-1
record firmly in check, Mattison
and Hoke won't let up.
"I don't know if the defense is
getting better," Hoke said.
From 110th-best defense in
the nation a year ago to a top-25
spottoday? It's clearthis defense
is improving. The players just
use Hoke's words as motivation.
"There's always going to be
people saying different things
about our defense, but the most
important things are the guys in
the locker room," Martin said.
"Every week's going to be a
test for us."

THE QUICK BREAKDOWN
M A IZ E G A U G E The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Denard-o-Meter measures the success of quarterback Denard
Robinson, the Beef-o-Meterjudges how emotional (positive or negative) Brady Hoke was following the game, and the Hype-o-Meter measures the fans' performance.

DENARD-O-METER
Other than one run, Robinson never made anybody
say "Wow." But he never made anybody say "Why?"
4 either. He had just170 passing and 63 yards rushing
Denards but, most importantly, he threwjust one interception.

BEEF-O-METER
4/ The defense was suffocating and Hoke gave
his running backs 37 carries as they went right
at the Purdue defense. That was the team
Brady Hokes Hoke envisioned when he came here.

HYPE-0-METER

Big Houses

That was embarassing. The student section was
two-thirds full the entire game. The only sav-
ing grace, and the only thing preventing this from
being a "1," was Buddy the Elf in the front row.


REDSHIRT SOPHOMORE
FITZGERALD TOUSSAINT: If there
was a performance that a running
back could have to become the lead
guy, that was it. Toussaint had 20
carries, proving he could shoulder
the load. He also had 170 yards,
giving him 8.5 yards per carry,
showing he could be the explosive
back that he was expected to
be. This was most evident in his
59-yard touchdown run, where
he side-stepped defenders, cut
back to the middle, and then
split the safeties en route to the
endzone. Toussaint had always
been the likely candidate for the
lead running back job but never
had a breakthrough performance.
This may have been it. Michigan
coach Brady Hoke wants to run
the power play for the rest of time.
After being a little banged up in
previous seasons, Toussaint is
healthy and appears ready to run
the power play for the rest of time.

REDSHIRT JUNIOR SAFETY
JORDAN KOVACS: This wasn't in
the script. If Disney sports movies
have taught us anything it's that
the walk-on struggles early on,
overcomes injuries, finally gets
on the team, earns a scholarship,
then becomes a huge star and
there's little to no adversity after
that. So it's safe to say everyone
was surprised when Kovacs, who
had followed the script religiously
until Saturday, had to sit out
with a knee injury. He made an
appearance before the game,
wearing sweats, but Kovacs hadn't
missed a game in his career. After
the game Hoke said he wasn't
sure how long Kovacs would be
out, meaning his status for the
Wolverines' matchup with Iowa
is in doubt. Obviously Hoke will
know if he's ready to go in practice,
but knowing the coach, there's no
way the general public will know
for sure until next week's kickoff.
