ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL
Council suspends art fund

Faculty want more
input in decisions
regarding athletics
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily StaffReporter
For some faculty members,
the announcement of Michi-
gan's matchup against the
University of South Carolina
in the Outback Bowl has been
overshadowed by the operating
practices of the University Ath-
letic Department.
Faculty members at Mon-
day's meeting of the Universi-
ty's Senate Advisory Committee
on University Affairs said there
was a lack of faculty input con-
cerning important decisions
made by the Athletic Depart-
ment, claiming faculty members
were not consulted about the
recent decision to expand the
Big Ten Conference.
Faculty members on the
Advisory Board on Intercolle-
giate Athletics lamented over
the relationship between the
Athletic Department and fac-
ulty members at the meeting.
The ABIA - whose members
are appointed by University
President Mary Sue Coleman

and approved by the Universi-
ty's Board of Regents - includes
facultymembers,alumni, Mich-
igan athletes, an executive offi-
cer and Athletic Director Dave
Brandon. Committee members
meet regularly to discuss sub-
stantive athletic department
matters.
According to its bylaws, the
committee serves an advisory
role to the athletic director
who "will seek and consider the
advice of the Advisory Board on
all major financial and policy
decisions with respect to the
program on intercollegiate ath-
letics."
Professors at the meet-
ing alleged that the Athletic
Department did not consult
the ABIA on the addition of the
Maryland and Rutgers to the
Big TenConference.
"I happen to think that the
implications of expanding the
conference ...aresignificantaca-
demic matters, and I was per-
sonally very disappointed when
I heard it on the radio," Political
Science Prof. Edie Goldenberg,
an ABIA member, said.
A primary concern among
professors in attendance was
that the Athletic Department
did not consider the well-being

In 9-1 vote, Council
disbands program
until April
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Though Ann Arbor voters
decided against supporting a
millage to fund public art in the
city in the election last month,
the Ann Arbor City Council

passed a resolution on Monday
that would also temporarily dis-
band the current Percent for Art
program.
The Council voted 9-1 to sus-
pend the plan, which devotes 1
percent of capital project allo-
cations to fund public art, until
April, opting to seek out a new
option for funding public art in
the interim. Because the newly
passed ordinance suspends the
Percent for Art program until
the spring, it is not expected to

have a significant effect on the
funding of public art in the near
future since the program draws
funds from capital projects that
are typically non-existent during
the winter.
During discussion on public
art funding, Councilmember
Jane Lumm (I-Ward 2) said she
supported the suspension from
the previous Council meeting,
claiming that the Council has
more pressing issues to tackle
than public art.

But, later in the discussion,
Mayor John Hieftje emphasized
that expenditures for programs
like the police and fire depart-
ments come from the city's gen-
eral fund, while funding for
public art rarely does, meaning
funding public art doesn't equate
to a loss of funding for city ser-
vices.

cilmember Chuck Warpehoski

LOCAL BUSINESSES
Tim Hortons
to open Thurs.
in Landmark

Shop to offer coffee,
breakfast and lunch
 on South U.
By KAITLYN BYRNE
For the Daily
Students with a hankering
for Tim Hortons coffee will
soon have another place to sati-
ate their craving beyond the Big
House concession stands.
According to Tini Hortons
officials, the coffee chain will
open its doors to a new shop on
Thursday in the first level of
the Landmark luxury apart-
ment complex on South Univer-
sity Avenue, offering a full menu
complete with coffee, breakfast
and lunch items.
Joel Brown - the director of
asset management at American
Campus Communities, which
owns Landmark - wrote in an
e-mail that the build-out for the
Tim Hortons's location is still in
progress and it will be positioned

inside the Landmark building,
opening directly onto South Uni-
versity.
With the 7-Eleven in the build-
ing opening last weekend, Tim
Hortons will be the next in a
series of businesses in the Land-
mark building, including No
Thai? and World of Beer, both of
which are expected to open this
spring, according to Brown.
Students living in Landmark
have expressed mixed feelings
about the opening.
LSA sophomore Tony Barron,
a resident of Landmark, spoke
positively of the store.
"I'm extremely excited
because it's going to be a lot more
convenient to grab coffee on
the way to class," Barron said.
"When I'm hungry, food is right
in my building, so it's awesome."
Barron mentioned that he
typically purchases coffee at the
nearby Espresso Royale on South
University, but will definitely be
switching to Tim Hortons after
the opening.

Egypt crisis widens with
strikes, planned march

4

New constitution,
Morsi power decree
cause unrest
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's politi-
cal crisis is widening, with plans
for a huge march and a general
strike Tuesday to protest the
hurried drafting of a new consti-
tution and decrees by President
Mohammed Morsi that gave him
nearly unrestricted powers.
Morsi also faces the prospect
of wider civil disobedience as
media, the tourism industry and
law professors pondered moves
that would build on a strike by
the nation's judges.
The planned strikes and
march raise new fears of unrest,
threatening to derail the coun-
try's transition to democratic
rule.
"Egypt is a big ship in high
seas, and no one should stop its
captain from taking it to the

shore," said Morsi's legal adviser,
Mohammed Gaballah, defending
his boss.
"The ship must keep moving
under any conditions," he told
The Associated Press on Mon-
day.
The country's judges have
already gone on strike over Mor-
si's Nov. 22 decrees that placed
him above oversight of any kind,
including the courts. Following
those decrees, a panel dominated
by the president's Islamist sup-
porters rushed through a draft
constitution without the partici-
pation of representatives of lib-
erals and Christians. Only four
women, all Islamists, attended
the marathon, all-night session.
Morsi has called for a Dec. 15
national referendum to approve
the constitution.
An opposition coalition domi-
nated by the liberal and leftist
groups that led last year's upris-
ing had already called for a gen-
eral strike Tuesday and a large

S IUIDIOIK.IUI

demonstration against the con-
stitutional process and Morsi's
decrees.
Newspapers plan to suspend
publication, and privately owned
TV networks will blacken their
screens all day.
Monday's front pages of
Egypt's most prominent news-
papers said, "No to dictator-
ship" on a black background,
with a picture of a man wrapped
in newspaper and with his feet
shackled while he squatted in a
prison cell.
Hotels and restaurants are
considering turning off their
lights for a half-hour to protest
against Morsi, according to the
Supporting Tourism Coalition,
an independent body represent-
ing industry employees.
Cairo University law profes-
sors petitioned their dean to let
them stop teaching.
"The professors believe they
must not teach law under a
regime that doesn't respect the
law," said one of the professors,
Khaled Abu Bakr.
The staff of the Internet
edition of the al-Ahram daily
marched Monday to the jour-
nalists' union in central Cairo to
protest what they said was the
absence from the draft constitu-
tion of guarantees against jailing
reporters in defamation cases.
Protests over the draft consti-
tution also spread to state televi-
sion.
On Sunday, presenter Hala
Fahmy carried a white shroud
while hosting a current affairs
program, according to footage
posted on the Internet. She was
taken off the air, but not before
she told viewers: "We have to tell
the truth whatever the price is.
We have to carry our shroud in
our hands."
She told the independent al-
Masri al-Youm daily newspaper
that she planned to sue the sta-
tion.
Morsi's moves have plunged
an already polarized Egypt in
the worst political crisis since
the uprising that ousted authori-
tarian President Hosni Mubarak.

U.N. decision on
Palestinian state
fuels rift
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
rejected a wave of American and
European condemnations Mon-
day over plans to build thousands
of new homes in West Bank set-
tlements, vowing to press for-
ward with the construction in
the face of widespread interna-
tional opposition.
The announcement from
Prime Minister Benjamin Netan-
yahu's office was likely to deepen
a rift that has emerged between
Israel and some of its closest
allies following the U.N.'s recog-
nition of a Palestinian state last
week. The U.N. decision appears
to be fueling a tougher interna-
tional line against Israeli settle-
ments in the West Bank and east
Jerusalem.
Israeli ambassadorswere sum-
moned for consultations in five
European capitals, and European
officials warned of other poten-
tial measures against Israel. In
Washington, the' U.S. said the
Israeli actions were "especially
damaging" to peace prospects.
Italian Premier Mario Monti
and French President Francois

Hollande issued a joint state-
ment saying they were "deeply
worried" by Israel's settlement
plans. The two men, meeting in
Lyon, France, called the Israeli
decisions "serious and illegal"
and a "serious obstacle" to Mid-
east peace.
Netanyahu, however, showed
no signs of bending. His office
said Israel would continue' to
stand up for its interests "even
in the face of international pres-
sure, and there will be no change
in the decision taken."
Europe could potentially play
a strong role in any international
action against the settlements.
Europe is Israel's largest trade
partner, and Israel has a part-
nership with the EU giving its
exports preferential status.
But divisions within Europe
could make it difficult to take
any concerted action. Germany,
Europe's largest economy, has
a close relationship with Israel,
and given its history as the per-
petrator of the Holocaust, it is
unlikely to take anystrong action
against the Jewish state.
In last week's decision, the
United Nations General Assem-
bly overwhelmingly recognized
a Palestinian state in the West
Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza
Strip, territories captured by

Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
Netanyahu rejects a return to
the 1967 lines. His government
also fears the Palestinians will
use their upgraded status to join 4
the U.N.'s International Crimi-
nal Court and pursue war crimes
charges against Israel.
But Israel was joined by only
eight other countries in oppos-
ing the bid, which was seen as a
resounding international rejec-
tion of Israeli settlements in
occupied territories. In a slap to
Israel, its closest European allies
- Britain, Germany, Italy and
France - all abstained or voted
with the Palestinians.
Israel has angrily condemned
the vote as an attempt by the
Palestinians to bypass negotia-
tions. In particular, Netanyahu's
government says it undermines
any chance of negotiations over
future border arrangements by
endorsing the Palestinians' ter-
ritorial demands.
The Israeli response to the
U.N. decision was swift and
strong. Just hours after Thurs-
day's vote, Israel announced
plans to build 3,000 new homes
in the West Bank and east Jeru-
salem. It also said it would begin
plans to develop a sensitive part
of the West Bank just outside of
Jerusalem.

CDC: Flu season
to start early
Flu season in the U.S. is offto its
earliest start in nearly a decade -
and it could be a bad one.
Health officials on Monday said
suspected flu cases have jumped
in five Southern states, and the
primary strain circulating -4
to make people sicker than other
types. It is particularly hard on
the elderly.
"It looks like it's shaping up to
be a bad flu season, but only time
will tell," said Dr. Thomas Frie-
den, director of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
The good news is that the
nation seems fairly well prepared,
Frieden said. More than a third of
Americans have been vaccinated,
and the vaccine formulated for
this year is well-matched to the
strains of the virus seen so far,
CDC officials said.
VATICAN CITY
Pope joins Twitter

Benedict XVI, the pope known
for his hefty volumes of theology
and lengthy encyclicals, is now
trying brevity - spreading the
faith through his own Twitter
account.
The pontiff will tweet in eight
.languages starting Dec. 12 using
his personal handle (at)Pontifex,
responding live to questions about
faith during his weekly general
audience, the Vatican said Mon-
day.
Within 10 hours of the Vatican's
announcement, Benedict had
already garnered nearly a quarter-
million followers on the English
version of (at)Pontifex alone, with
thousands more following him in
the eight other language accounts.
All that, and he hadn't sent a
single tweet.
He may never hit the 1 billion
faithful that the Catholic Church
counts around the globe, but he's
odds-on to get 1 million follow-
ers by the end of the year, British
bookmakers Ladbrokes said.
The pope sent his first tweet
last year from a generic Vatican
account to launch the Holy See's
news information portal, and
someone in his name tweeted
daily during Lent, part of the
r Vatican's efforts to increase the
church presence in social media.

of student athletes. Goldenberg
specifically noted that the addi-
tion of the two East Coast schools
could burden students with long
travel times.
ABIA members also claimed
that other proposals, such as add-
ing new sports teams or changes
to ticket prices, are consistently
neglected to be mentioned to the
council until after a decision is
made.
"We hear about it afterwards,"
Communication Studies Prof.
Rowell Huesmann, an ABIA
member, said.
"(Brandon) cut the number
of meetings down dramatically,
but he made them longer. So,
they tend to be presentations
by him and his staff to us about
things that are already pretty
(decided)," Goldenberg said.
The Athletic Department
did not respond to requests for
comment on Monday.
Some professors said Bran-
don's role as chair and his con-
trol over the agenda for ABIA

is the reason it has not ful-
filled its role. Medical School
Prof. Charles Koopmann, a
SACUA member who also for-
merly served on the ABIA, said
the University is an "outlier"
because it does not have a pro-
fessor serve as the chair of the
committee.
"Whoever sets the agenda,
sets the meeting," Koopman
said. "It would be at least a rea-
sonable accommodation to have
the SACUA chair or a faculty
member sitting down with the
athletic director and jointly set-
ting up an agenda."
ABIA member Michael
Imperiale, a Medical School
professor, pointed out that
Brandon does not have a vote
and that the committee is
meant to advise the athletic
director.
"My sense is that it's not our
job to micromanage the Athlet-
ic Department," Imperiale said.
"I think we need to remember
that while these are student
athletes and while we do look
after the student athletes, really
this is the Athletic Department
and it's not an academic unit."

and are connected to the pulmo-
nary artery by a graft that pumps
blood into the device. Though
it has only been tested on sheep
so far, Cook said it has received
positive results.
"That's very much the way
your natural lung works," Cook
said. "Your natural lung receives
blood from the pulmonary artery
and returns blood to the left atri-
um."
In the sheep trials, the
researchers found that the lungs
have stayed clean and had no
change in resistance after 14
days, whereas normally the
blood flow resistance in the
lungs would triple over nine
days due to clotting.
As opposed to extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation - the
current oxygenation system for
patients who need lung trans-
plants - attaching the TALs to
the pulmonary artery requires
an invasive surgery. Cook said
he believes the benefits TALs
provide are greater than those
of ECMO.
Specifically, he noted that
they remove much of the circuit-
ry of ECMO, are gentler on the
blood, work more like n natural
lung and allow the patient to be
mobile instead of bed ridden.
Cook noted that in order to
receive a transplant, patients
have to be physically strong
enough to handle the operation.

"Tim Hortons may not be as
good as Espresso Royale, but
because it's more convenient for
me as a resident of Landmark
I'll definitely be going there,"
Barron said.
LSA junior, Myles Barkoff, a
fellow Landmark resident dis-
agrees.
"Tim Hortons is like a poor
man's Dunkin' Donuts," Barkoff
said. "I want Dunkin' Donuts."
Employees at popular coffee
shops in the South University
neighborhood did not express
anxiety that the opening of Tim
Hortons opening would trigger
their own workplaces to lose
much business.
Alexis Cook, a barista at
Espresso Royale, argued thatcthe
contrast in atmosphere between
chain coffee shops and small
businesses creates a separation
in playing field for business com-

If patients are bed-ridden they
often are never able to build up
the necessary strength.
"If you have a patient that is
decompensating and needs a
lung very soon, ECMO is a good
mode of support," Cook said.
"Now, if you need to go beyond
that period (of a few weeks), I
think that the patient will be far
better served by having a Ho-
racic artificial lung."
David Skoog, a graduate stu-
dent research assistant in bio-
medical engineering who builds
the lungs fortesting, said it takes
a few weeks to build one because
they are all handmade.
"Since there are a lot of steps
in the process, we always have
several lungs being made at the
same time, just at different stag-
es in the process because it's so
time consuming," Skoog said.
"Otherwise we'd never be able
to produce enough devices to do
our experiments."
Cook added that the TALs cur-
rently beingtested didn'thave an
anticoagulation coating on them,
adding that he believes with the
addition of a coating, the lungs
could last up to a month without
having to be replaced.
Cook said his ultimate goal is
to support all the patients who
won't ever make it to the trans-
plant list. However, he said he
is unsure as to when TALs will
make it to human clinical trials.
"The answer is always five
years (until clinical trials). We
always say five years," Cook
said.
petition.
"Big chains are big chains,
and people will go either way,"
she said.
The quirks and coziness of
smaller businesses like Espresso
Royale attract loyal custom-
ers and a regular clientele, she
added.
"People who enjoy this kind
of experience will keep coming,"
she said.
Justin Hood, manager of the
Starbucks location on South
University, demonstrated a simi-
lar confidence on the matter.
"Ever since (Landmark)
opened, we've been really busy,"
he explained, "And I don't fore-
see any lost business."
In reference to already regu-
lar Starbucks c-nsumers, he
reasoned that the growing pop-
ularity of the Starbucks rewards
program create incentive for
customers to remain loyal.
"I don't think (Tim Hortons)
is really going to impact us," he
said.

Purdy added that Special

there was strong interest from
Athletic Department employees
to volunteer year round at local
competitions and training.
The Special Olympics Michi-
gan's long-term goals are to
further integrate volunteers,
perhaps certify coaches and
have the polar plunge become
an annual event at the Big
House, Purdy said. She added
that the Athletic Department
will help Special Olympics
athletes with disabilities feel
included and united in the larg-
er community.
Anne Rogers, the special
projects manager for the Special
Olympics Michigan, said she is
impressed with the efforts put
forth by the Athletic Depart-
ment's team members.
"I think it's really impres-
sive that they come together as
a staff," Rogers said. "This is
exclusively for their staff, it's
really not for the student ath-
letes ... it really is staff driven,"
Rogers said.
She called the collaboration a
"win-win" iftuation for the Ath-
letic Department and the Spe-
cial Olympics Michigan.
"They're such a great group,"
Rogers said. "Our missions align
- that we both focus on sports
- and I just think that they will
be great volunteers. And the
experience with them will be
rewarding as well - to spend
time with our athletes. We're
very excited about it."
"It was only a couple of years
ago that we would get calls from
the newsroom and hear people
say, 'Who is Marcellus Shale and
why do you keep writing about
it?' Schwartzel said.
Erica Brown, a graduate stu-
dent instructor in the School of
Public Policy, asked the panel-
ists whether they have observed
public opinion shaping fracking
policies. Pless responded that it
depends on the influx of drilling
in the given state.
"Public opinion is possibly
coming into play a lot more in
Pennsylvania than in Texas
where they've been drilling for
a longer time," Pless said.
Borick added that he thinks
the ideal Pennsylvania system
would include more public ben-
efit since many Pennsylvanians
believe shale oil is a public
resource.
"Pennsylvanians, although
they think it's good for the state,
don't think fracking provides
the maximum amount of ben-
efit,"-Borick said.
LSA sophomore Marissa Sol-
omon attended the event due to

her interest in environmental
policies. After the panel, she
said she was happy the lecture
was informative and unbiased.
"I thought they did a really
good job of not being super
biased, but still kind of show-
ing concerns on both sides, and
they all seemed like they were
experts on the issue," Solomon
said.
Solomon added that people
should take time to educate
themselves about fracking,
since it is becoming a relevant
policy issue in Michigan.
"Michigan residents should
really take the time to learn
about fracking more," Solomon
said. "It's becoming a really
big issue here with Governor
Snyder supporting it (and) a lot
of environmental groups are
against it."

FRACKING
From Page 1
shale fracturing to extract natu-
ral gas in Michigan.
Fracking is a method of
extracting oil and gas byutilizing
underground hydraulic pressure.
Jacquelyn Pless, a policy asso-
ciate for the Energy Program at
the National Conference of State
Legislatures, said fracking offers
technological advances, such as
enhancing natural gas recovery
and loweringelectric power pric-
es, as well as economic benefits,
such as job creation and helping
the state and local governments
w:, a tight budget.
She added that there are also
negative health consequences
of fracking to consider, such as
water contamination and with-
drawal, as well as the negative
impact on the surrounding veg-
etation and wildlife.
"Water contamination is
linked to natural gas operations,
such as spills and leaks," Pless
said.
At the W.K. Kellogg Biologi-
cal Station in Battle Creek, Mich.
last Wednesday, Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder delivered an address
on the state of Michigan's envi-
ronmental affairs. He specifical-
ly remarked on how the state can
"do better" in regards to envi-
ronmental efficiency and that
the state should take advantage
of hydraulic fracturing to extract
natural gas.
Accordina, to Pless, 158 bills
regarding fracking have been
introduced in26 states this legis-
lative session.Allofthem address
the enhancements of fracking
through improved waste treat-
ment and disposal in a variety
of ways, such as chemical dis-
closure requirements and frackN
ing fluid disclosure. Pless said
Michigan is looking into similar
measures to ensure safe fracking
practices.

"Miahigan state legislators are
aimingto delay fracking opera-
tions util more is known about
effects;" Pless said. "(Fracking)
offers tremendous economic
benefit, and states are working
to ensore resources are devel-
oped safely."
As fiacking becomes a central
issue it Michigan, Rabe empha-
sized tlat public opinion is more
importtnt than ever.
"This is an issue that's been
emergiig for a num... of years,"
Rabe said.
Christopher Borick, a pro-
fessor of political science and
director of the Muhlenberg Col-
lege Intitute of Public Opinion,
discused his telephone survey
study :onducted last October
that aompared responses of
Michigan and Pennsylvania resi-
dents.
Borik said he chose to com-
pare Nichigan with Pennsylva-
nia because the Keystone state
is pioeering fracking prac-,
tices it the United States and
is acclamed as the new energy
capitaf the world.
According to Borick, the fed-
eral gorernment's influence on
frackiny policy remains quite
limited and the state has the
opportinity to institute its own
regulatory policies without
much fideral oversight.
"What does the public -feel
about Itate level regulation of
frackirg)? Who should be regu-
lating? Mill regulation deter eco-
nomic levelopment? How do we
find the way to have it both eco-
nomicaly prosperous and at the
same tme protect the natural
resoures?" Borick said.
The last panelist, Erich
Schwattzel - the editor of
Pipeline, the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette's site detailing natural
gas dilling in Pennsylvania
- opeed with a light joke, yet
noted tiat fracking has garnered
significtnt public opinion in the
state.

ger community involvement in

programs.
He added he would also like
more community participation
in physically helping create the
art, as well as more community
leverage, citing Toledo, Ohio as
a city that he said has its public
arts funded in partby donations.
When votes were cast, Coun-
cilmember Margie Teall (D-
Ward 4) was the only member
in opposition and even called

for a roll-call vote, saying that it
sent the wrong message to sup-
porters of public art in the city.
"(The suspension) does put a
chill on the ideas and the par-
ticipants," Teall said.
She said this direct involve-
ment in public art funding was
"micromanaging," adding that
she would-like to see more staff
for the Public Art Commission.
Kunselman, like other coun-
cilmembers, said that no one is
against funding public art, but
people disagree on how public
art should be funded. And that's
regrettable, he said.
"I feel sad for AAPAC
because they've been uealt a

Working the system
Fraternity's allegations serious cause for concern
Rumors about the incident involving sexual assault spread around
campus and the Greek community too cften for comfort. Soror-
ity members are warned by their peers :n Facebook or notified
via e-mail, but sometimes no concrete punishment is taken against the
alleged criminal. Unfortunately, this happens al universities.across the
nation. The University chapter of Zeta Beta Tat was shut down by the
national organization for allegedly harboring an "unsafe environment."
The chapter has also previously faced years of dllegations about sexual
assault and extreme hazing. The actions taken 'y officials, though, are
not enough. Instead of simply disassociating the alleged wrongdoers
from their larger institutions, students themselves need to take personal
responsibility and speak out about the reported events.

I:

In 2006, ZBT was expelled by the Inter-
fraternity Council for rule violations and
reported incidents of extreme hazing and has
not been recognized by the University since.
They then continued to act as an unaffiliated
fraternity at the University until their clo-
sure last week. Recently, the Daily reported a
security guard was placed outside the frater-
nity's house on Oxford Road by ZBT's.nation-
al headquarters in order to ensure no damage
is done to the property and no more parties
are thrown at the location.
One of the main problems is the fact that
nobody is willing to report indiscretions to
authorities. E-mails and messages are sent
out to members of the Greek system, warning
each other about the dangers of certain fra-
ternities, but incidents often go unreported.
No action is being taken against any individ-
uals which, in turn, fosters the negative and
unsafe Greek life culture.
The punishments that are taken against
the indiscreet fraternities are arbitrary and
do not actually penalize the people at fault.
Simply disassociating fraternities from the

IFC or their national bodies does not bring
about justice to the victims, nor is it an
adequate punishment. For years, penalties
have been thesame and we have yet to see
progress. Acctrding to The Michigan Daily,
ZBT was previously suspended by the IFC
in 2000 due tohazing allegations. They then
returned as ai IFC member one year later.
The cycle is continuous and creates no real
solution to persisting problems. Greater
action needs to be taken against non-abiding
members.
Furthermore, the Greek system needs to
work internaly to report crimes and pro-
mote safety. These problems point to inher-
ent flaws in :he culture: fraternities and
sororities need to stress the importance of
respect. They need to implement a zero-tol-
erance policy against hazing, sexual assault
and any other acts that could be deemed ille-
gal or emotioially and physically harmful.
By doing so, me can begin to tear apart this
socially accep:ed norm among college stu-
dents and creite a better environment that
fosters respect rather than abuse.

W ith the departure of
University Provost
Philip Hanlon to Dart-
mouth and cur-
rent University
President Mary
Sue Coleman's
contract expiring
in 2014, Michi-
gan's administra-
tion may become
vastly different JAMES
in the coming BRENNAN
years. Regardless
of the change,
our University must stay committed
to the state's largest city, Detroit.
Michigan has already taken an
active role in working in Detroit,
but this is only the beginning of
what could become a fruitful, long-
term relationship. President Mary
Sue Coleman has set an excellent
example of commitment to the
city, overseeing the creation of
Michigan's Detroit Center and the
development of multiple outreach,
service and learning programs. Our
next set of leaders - both the presi-
dent and provost - must continue
and expand upon President Cole-
man's work in Detroit.
After decades of deindustrializa-
tion, population loss and high crime
rates, sparks of hope and revitaliza-
tion have been spotted throughout
the city. The resilient community
take it upon themselves to rebuild
and innovate, while the downtown
and midtown areas are quickly
becoming attractive spots for young
college graduates to start their new
lives at low cost living. It may be
hard to notice with nightly reports
of shootings, thefts and government
corruption, but Detroit is on its way
up - and the University needs to be
a part of this ascent.
With our massive endowment,
far-reaching influence, extensive
network of alumni and student body
committed to service and innova-
tion, we have the ability to greatly

contribute to the rebuilding of a
city in need of assistance. Our stu-
dents and staff are some of the best
the state, the country and the world
have to offer. As a public university
receivingfundingfrom the state, the
University's president and provost
should make service to the state a
top priority. People have said it a
million times, and I'll say it again:
We cannot have a thriving Michigan
without a thriving city of Detroit.
The University was founded
almost 200 years ago in Detroit
- we must stay committed and
connected to the city. As Detroit's
position among U.S. cities has risen
and fallen, so has the position of the
state of Michigan. The state's econ-
omy greatly depends on the status
of the city, and by extension, affects
the University's budget'and ability
to provide for students in a similar
fashion. The next president and
provost must understand the long-
term necessity to assist the rebuild-
ing of Detroit.
This past summer, I spent two
months living in the city as part of
the University's relatively young
Semester in Detroit program.
During my time living in the fast
growing mid-town area, I took
classes focused on urban studies and
worked part time with the American
Civil Liberties Union of Michigan.
Other students worked in areas as
diverse as education, architecture,
performing arts and community
development. Living in the city, I
was exposed to people from walks
of life I would otherwise have likely
never met, took in cultural experi-
ences unique to Detroit and had a
great internship despite only being a
freshman. My time in Detroit wasn't
only a way to serve the city, but also
a great opportunity to build my
resume and develop personally.
After finishing the program, I took
a job on a campaign and spent limited
time in the city, only visiting weekly
for meetings and each time wishing

I could stay for longer. I have always
had affection for the city, but living
there for two months and experi-
encing day-to-day life as a Detroiter
changed my perspective completely.
Obviously not everyone can spend
an entire semester in the city, but I
would recommend something simi-
lar to the University's next adminis-
tration: make Detroit a requirement.
A day of service
in Detroit should
be required for
all students.
What I mean is that a program
should be established there each
year. Every freshman would go to
Detroit for a day to learn about the
city and perform community ser-
vice. Logistically, this would be
tough, I understand, but hear me
out. By requiring a day of service and
learning in the city, the University
would make it clear to every student
the importance of Detroit. Students
ignorant of the city's situation would
become better informed and per-
haps even discover a newfound com-
mitment to rebuilding Detroit.
I will admit, my proposal. is a
bit lofty, but the idea of an admin-
istration committed to Detroit is
not crazy. President Coleman has
started the trend, and the Board
of Regents must make it clear that
this movement to help the city is
not ending any time soon. My hope
is that in 2014, as I graduate and
transition into adulthood, I will be
joined in Detroit not only by my fel-
low alums, but also by a large group
of committed students and faculty.

Hours on End

KAAN AVDAN IEPINT
Sought after democracy

I

According to our wonderful fellow student
Brandon Shaw's new book, there are 175 hours
in a week - or, at least, there can be. The book,
"Twenty Five Hours a Day: Embracing the
Internet Generation," is a testimony to what
can be, in what the suits have so aptly named
the "information age." It's a work defining
three completely separate and utterly unique
yet interconnected principles: possibility,
capability and opportunity, as applicable to
physical reality and supplemented by the vir-
tual totality we've become so fond of. OK, so
that was a mouthful. I'll try again: Shaw (or
should I say, Linder) transcribes his intimate
experiences with being told what's possible,
discovering of what he's capable and taking
"seriously and severely" the opportunities
that may not have been "possible" but which
unveiled themselves once he proved himself
"capable." It's a work begging us to reconsider
our understanding of "reality" in the age of
profiles, accounts and handles. Let's discuss.
I think we should start with the latter
first, to lay the interactive framework by
which possibility, capability and opportunity
find themselves. So what in this paper-for-
saken world can we call "reality?" In other
words, what do our actions on the Internet
mean for our actions when we run out of bat-
tery? Shaw asserts that the two are one in the
same; they both, for lack of a better phrase,
are simply expressions of ourselves. In that
sense, our "stalking" on Facebook is equiv-
alent to asking our friends about that hot
chick over lunch.
Something of particular interest is, as Shaw
calls it, the "serious status." It's not that this
status intrigues more than any other, but that
we can even wrap our heads around the idea
that any other might be less serious. "Sever-
ity" of expression should not be limited to the
times when we are the most desperately in
need. I feel as severely against Mark Sanchez
as I do against the endless stack of practice
tests the night before the big game. I happen
to think that what Shaw is questioning is not
the content of what we post, but how con-
tent we are to seriously and severely take the
time to consider it. In this way, our virtual
and physical realities are not, but should be,

along a contimum, each one referencing and
supplementing the other.
Who we art on Facebook is different than
who we are inthe cafeteria only because our
friends do notgive us the time we deserve.
And perhaps that is the sin of the constant
flow of infornation - as Roger Scruton so
eloquently puts it, our compulsion is to "click
on our friends as you might click on a news
item or a musi video." They are amusements
that are distrtctions from, not complements
to, our daily reality.
So what do's any of this have to do with
possibilities aid capabilities and opportuni-
ties? Perhaps,as Shaw writes in reference to
relationships,-"it begins and ends (with the
question): whit is 'normal' and why should
we care."
I think it I-as something to do with that
natural sin o our generation: procrastina-
tion. If we soinsistently consider our social
media to be eactly that - media - then we
ourselves are :reating a fragmented normal-
ity of our respective realities. That is, so long
as Twitter is ai escape from an awkward con-,
versation at Sleeps rather than a supplement
to that conversation, it will not be normal for
us to apply it to real life. If, on the other hand,
it was a "soci'd medium," a true resource for.
our interactims with one another, then we
might be ableto consider it normal (and rel-
evant) in dailylife.
Possibilities are defined by what we can
see. Capabilites are defined by what we (as
individuals) would do. Opportunities are cre-
ated by what ve do about what we see -they
don't come loiking. "Twenty Five Hours" is
a personal acount of an experience in which
reality includes what we post as well as what
we say, in whch the virtual world is a nor-
mal complement to the physical one, in which
social media became a social medium and
in which opportunities revealed themselves
from the capaeility to seriously and severely
act on the pocibilities laid out. Do yourself a
favor and readthe book. You'll probably come
out as confused and incoherent as me, and at
least then youll feel some of what I've tried.
Eli Cahan is a Business sophomore.

While the developed world
struggles economically, the so-
called emerging economies -
roughly identified as Brazil, China,
India, Mexico, Russia and Turkey
- breezed through the global finan-
cial crisis of 2008 and rapidly went
back to the track of fast economic
growth. The political dynamics
of these countries are often disre-
garded as long as there's stability;
however, three of these countries
especially demonstrate a new polit-
ical and economic occurrence.
All of the identified countries
have had trouble developing the
democratic processes within their
systems, but China, Russia and
Turkey have a common pattern
that sets them apart. Historically,
these countries and their predeces-
sors have almost always possessed
regional power and then rose to the
international scene once conflicts
escalated. They shared an auto-
cratic form of government until the
early 20th century, and have had
trouble transitioning into democra-
cies ever since. Today, these coun-
tries are similar in that they share
political stability, economic prog-
ress and corruption.
Each case must be looked at
separately to elucidate how these
three developing countries and
their benchmark characteristics
may lead to capitalism and democ-
racy in the future. Growth in
democracy doesn't parallel growth
in the economy. Democratic prog-
ress is far more convoluted and
harder to achieve. However, as
the developed world staggers eco-
nomically, confidence in the global
market is lost while respect in its
institutions and democratic values
are marred. Therefore, it's more
likely that the course of democrat-
ic progress for the underdeveloped
countries will follow that of China,
Russia and Turkey.
China has never historically been
a multi-party democracy, and today's

People's Republic of China can be
regarded as the least democratic
among the trio. The PRC has had
solid political stability since its foun-
dation, which allows the government
to act freely without worrying about
losing power. Given the country's
communist background, its presi-
dents and premiers act as benevolent
social and economic planners who
vigorously engage the state in an
open market environment.
The Russian Federation, the suc-
cessor of the Soviet Union, has been
harshly criticized in regards to civil
rights. In May 2012, Vladimir Putin
was elected president of Russia for
the third time in a highly-fraud-
ulent election. Massive protests
followed the elections, and NGOs
called for a recount. The protesters'
calls were futile, and Putin became
the president once again.
The opposition in Russia argues
that Putin has created a system of
barons, similar to landlords, who
control massive businesses among
both rural parts and commercial
hubs of Russia thanks to invest-
ment stimuli and privileges given
to them. In return, these barons -
in effect, businessmen - remain
loyal to Putin and support him
when necessary. Putin now enjoys
his 12th year in power as a one-man
leader, dominating not only the
political scene, but also the social.
Turkey, a Republic since 1923 and
a multiparty democracy since 1945,
has had its fair share of political
instability. The country has gone
through two coup d'dtats and many
short lived, unproductive coalition
governments. In 2002, Recep Taky-
ip Erdogan became prime minister
and continues to hold that position
today. Since his rise to power, he
has been criticized for diminishing
the state's secularity and impris-
oning unprecedented numbers of
elected politicians, activists, jour-
nalists and army generals. Brutal
and excessive police force against

demonstrators and protesters is
another major concern.
The political freedom the gov-
ernments enjoy as well as the sub-
sequent disappearance of checks
and balances systems has resulted
in a surge of corruption in all three
of these countries. The politburo of
China rhetorically acknowledges
corruption but doesn't fight the
corrupted factions within itself
because it's often the high officials
themselves who are part of the
problem. The situation is similar
in Russia and Turkey. Their polit-
buros are in the phase of estab-
lishment, and Putin and Erdogan's
parties chronically control the
state's politics. The people consid-
ered close to the government enjoy
more and more business'opportuni-
ties, making both government offi-
cials and themselves richer.
In spite of all of this, in the past
10 to 15 years the countries have
liberalized their economies and
started on the path of rapid eco-
nomic progress. All of the coun-
tries have achieved over five years
of consecutive growth, stabilized
inflation and decreased unemploy-
ment. As a result, real incomes
have increased. Since people have
become more able to obtain their
goals through economic improve-
ment, they tend to disregard the
flaws in their democracies.
Fast economic growth makes it
easy for political leaders to stay in
power. If the economic boom in the
developing world continues, the
democratic process is likely to wors-
en or stay as it is like in China, but
rapid growth has an end. The coun-
tries will have risen above a certain
threshold of wealth. Growth will
slow down, recessions will occur,
politburos will be questioned and
doubted, and political parties will
lose dominance. Finally, true democ-
racy will be sought

Reckless'Warrior'
Ke$hais

TV themes set the tone

dependably edgy on
latest album
By GREGORY HICKS
Daily Arts Writer
With her recent No. 1 hit, "Die
Young," Ke$ha's new record
Warrior will likely fly off shelves
- especially
given the eter-
nity fans have
waited since Warrior
her debut studio
album, 2010's Ke$ha
Animal. RCA
Though
Warrior dives
into a new style for the queen of
all things trashy, Dr. Luke and
Ke$ha are still connected at. the
hip. Given the sensations that
Luke has generated for Ke$ha
as her executive producer, it was
wise not to mess with success.
The record's first track, "War-
rior," catapults headfirst into
everything expected '- overpro-
duced chorus vocals, acoustic
white-trash rap verses and biting
kick drum. No complaints there.
It's the atmosphere of this track
that strays from expectation,
however. "Warrior" carries a seri-
ous tone, "fighting 'til the end"
because there's "something that's
inside of us, it's how we've always
been." It seems similar to how
someone might "fight 'til (they)
see the sunlight," but the melody
of the song feels distant from the
carefree rebellion of "Tik Tok."
"Warrior" might leave its lis-
teners more afraid of Ke$ha than
in love with her, but once they
queue up "C'mon" and "start sip-

"Dirt and glitter cover my face."
ping on a warm Budweiser," the
fans will resume their infatua-
tion with her grungy, untroubled
style. Don't overlook the clever
play on words, either. Ke$ha isn't
a thief who "steals some bubble-
gum from the'corner Maximart,"
so much as she's poking fun at her
famous songwriter, Max Martin.
Don't expect anything heart-
felt from the sentimental sound-
ing track "Thinking of You." The
emotion in the melody is audible,
but the lyrics intentionally gen-
erate a few laughs. Admit it: If
you could be Ke$ha for a day, you
would flaunt to that ex-boyfriend
of yours that your "song's on the
radio" and he has to "see (your)
face everywhere (he) goes." And,
of course, there's nothing quite
like a "suck my dick" line com-
ing from a female pop star. If,
for some reason, a fan wanted a
softer side of Ke$ha, they'd best
do their soul searching in "Wher-
ever You Are" and "Wonderland."
Luckily for Ke$ha, her screwy
rap-tune music and bellicose
nature are enough to lure a crowd
beyond 13-year-old girls. That

said, a reasonable chunk of her
fan base will enjoy the '70s-style
rock portion of the album. Iggy
Pop lends Ke$ha a helping hand
in the search for her inner punk
rock on the track "Dirty Love,"
while Patrick Carney steers herin
a blues rock direction for "Won-
derland." A round of applause is
in order for avoiding basic col-
laborations with Nicki Minaj and
Pitbull.
Of these classic-style tracks,
the most likely to strike a chord
with a modern crowd is "Only
Wanna Dance With You." A
catchy beat that doesn't sound
completely synthetic? Apparent-
ly, such a thing isn't extinct.
Dr. Luke must've been ecstatic
when he heard that, for the first
time, Ke$ha wanted guitar on
a record. There's nothing like
being SNL's lead guitarist for
seven years, only to have one of
your biggest stars refuse your
instrument of choice. Fear not,
though. Warrior still brings out
the Animal in Ke$ha, even if she
feels-more like Iggy Pop and less
like P. Diddy.

Mr. Alpern did hum a merry tune
himself on occasion. But this
girl was committing a far worse
crime, a deeply unforgivable sin:
The tune she was humming was
wrong.
The first time, I thought it was
a mistake. She deviated slightly; I
pretended not to hear it. But she
picked up steam with her "cre-
ative license," adding in notes and
mini-solos within her interpreta-
tions. I became increasingly more
incensed.
The theme to "HowI Met
Your Mother" is nothing short of
perfect for the tone of the show.
A catchy series of "ba's" is sung
as photos of a sepia-toned Neil
Patrick Harris gesture's in the
audience's general direction.
The simple tune is more than an
introduction; it's the homey, com-
forting embrace of a show that is
TV's soul food. It's mom's "Wel-

U.N. pulls staff from Syria

Britons rejoice, Palace
annouces pregnancy

Fears rise as
rebel forces near
Damascus
BEIRUT (AP) - Fighting
between rebels and government
forces raged near the Syrian
capital Damascus on Monday,
forcing.an inbound commercial
jet to turn back while the U.N.
said it was withdrawing staff
because of deteriorating secu-
rity conditions.
Lebanese security officials
said Jihad Makdissi, a polished
Foreign Ministry spokesman
known for defending the regime
of President Bashar Assad in flu-
ent English, flew from Beirut to
London. But it was not imme-
diately clear whether he had
defected.
The fighting over the past few
weeks in and around Damascus
has been the most serious in the
capital since July, when rebels
captured several neighborhoods
before a swiftgovernment coun-
teroffensive swept them out.
The spike in violence recently
is concentrated in the ring of
mostly poor suburbs around
Damascus but often bleeds into
the capital itself as rebels bring
their fight closer to Assad's seat
of power. Assad's forces have so
far repelled major rebel advanc-
es on the capital, though their
hold maybe slipping.
"The security situation has
become extremely difficult,
including in Damascus,". said
Radhouane Nouicer, the U.N.'s
regional humanitarian coordi-
nator for Syria.
Nouicer said the U.N. was
withdrawing most of its inter-
national staff from Syria due to
security issues, adding that up
to one quarter of the 100 inter-
national staff working for sev-
eral U.N. agencies could leave by
week's end. There are about 900
more local staff working for the
U.N. in Syria, officials said.
U.N. teams are also stopping
most staff trips outside Damas-
cus.
In another sign of deteriorat-
ing security, an Egyptian com-
mercial jet aborted a trip to.
Damascus in mid-flight because
of violence near the airport.
The EgyptAir flight from Cairo
rerouted about 30 minutes after
takeoff because Egyptian offi-

cials received word from their
counterparts in Damascus that
the area near the airport was not
safe, Egyptian airport officials
said.
EgyptAir canceled all further
flights to Syria for Monday and
Tuesday and will decide later
whether to resume flights later
in the week, the officials said,
speaking on condition of ano-
nymity because they were not
authorized to speak to report-
ers.
EgyptAir had just resumed
flights following a three-day
suspension because of violence
near the airport.
Emirates airlines said on its
website that all flights to Syria
were suspended "until further
notice."
The Britain-based opposition
activist group Syrian Observa-
tory for Human Rights said the
clashes were within three kilo-
meters (2 miles) of the airport,
which lies about 25 kilometers
(15 miles) southeast of the city
center. The state news service
reported clashes in an area
about 15 kilometers (9 miles)
from the airport. It said nothing
about flight cancelations.
More than 40,000 people
have been killed since the Syrian
revolt started in March last year.
Leaders of Russia - a key
supporter of the Assad regime
- and opposition ally Turkey
discussed disagreements over
Syria.
After talks in Istanbul, Rus-
sian President Vladimir Putin
said that the deployment of
NATO antiaircraft missiles
along the Turkish border could
make the conflict worse.
"Creating a new potential on
the border will not settle the
situation but rather exacerbate
it," he said. "Why would we need
more shelling on the border?"
The two countries are firmly
enmeshed in Syria's conflict, on
opposite sides. Russia continues
to back Assad, thrice protecting
his regime from censure by the
U.N. Security Council. Turkey
has called for Assad's ouster and
its southern border with Turkey
has become a key supply line for
rebel forces.
Lebanese security officials
said Makdissi, the Foreign Min-
istry spokesman known for
defending Assad crackdown on
the opposition as necessary mil-

itary action against "terrorists,"
flew from Beirut to London. It
was not immediately known
whether he had abandoned the
regime and he did not respond
to phone calls.
The officials spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity because they
were not authorized to brief the
media.
The U.S. has so far declined
to intervene in Syria's civil war,
saying doing so could worsen the
conflict.
U.S. officials said the White
House and its allies are weigh-
ing military options to secure
Syria's chemical and biological
weapons, after U.S. intelligence
reports show the Syrian regime
may be readying those weapons
and may be desperate enough to
use them.
President Barack Obama
pointedly warned Assad on'
Monday not to use the weapons.
"Today I want to make it
absolutely clear to Assad and
those under his command: The
world is watching," Obama
said in a speech at the National
Defense University. "The use of
chemical weapons is and would
be totally unaer"ptable. And if
you make the tragic mistake of
using these weapons, there will
be consequences and you will be
held accountable."
Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton, in Prague for
meetings with Czech officials,
said she wouldn't outline any
specifics.
"But suffice it to say, we
are certainly planning to tuke
action if that eventuality were to
occur," Clinton said.
Options now being consid-
ered range from aerial strikes to
limited raids by regional forces
to secure the stockpiles, accord-
ing to one current U.S. official,
and one former U.S. official,
briefed on the matter. The offi-
cials spok- .. condition of ano-
nymity because they were not
authorized to discuss the matter
publicly.
Syria is believed to have sev-
eral hundred ballistic surface-
to-surface missiles capable of
carrying chemical warheads,
and a U.S. defense official said
American and allied intelligence
officials have detected activity
around more than one of Syria's
chemical weapons sites in the
last week.

William and Kate's
child will be third in
line to the throne
Britain doesn't have to wait
any longer: Prince William's
wife, Kate, is pregnant.
St. James's Palace made the
announcement Monday, saying
that the Duchess of Cambridge -
formerly Kate Middleton - has a
severe form of morning sickness
and is currently ina London hos-
pital. William was at his wife's
side.
The news drew congratula-
tions from around the world,
with the hashtag "royalbaby"
trending globally on Twitter.
The couple's first child will
be third in line to the throne -
behind William and his father,
Prince Charles - leapfrogging
the gregarious Prince Harry
and possibly set':.. up the first
scenario in which a female heir
could benefit from new gender
rules about succession.
The palace would not say how
far along the 30-year-old duch-
ess is, only that she has not yet
reached the 12-week mark.
Palace officials said the duch-
ess was hospitalized with hyper-
emesis gravidarum, a severe
form of morning sickness that
affects about1 in 200 women and
can lead to dehydration or worse
if left untreated. They said she
was expected to remain hospital-
ized for several days and would
require a period of rest after-
ward.
Until Monday's announce-
ment, the duchess had shown
no signs of being with child. She
was photographed just last week
bounding across a field clad in
black high-heeled boots as she
played field hockey with stu-
dents at her former school.
Still, speculation has swirled
about when she and William
would start a family from almost
the moment they were wed on
April 29, 2011, in a lavish ceremo-
.ny at Westminster Abbey.
The attractive young couple
is immensely popular - with
William's easy common touch
reminding many of his mother,
the late Princess Diana - and

their child is expected to play an
important role in British nation-
al life for decades to come.
For months, Kate's every
move has been scrutinized for
clues about a possible -pregnan-
cy - from each time she touched
her stomach to whether her
outfit choices hinted at a baby
bump.
In September, tongues wagged
over why she might be avoiding
alcohol when the duchess opted
to toast with a glass of ice w ager

young royals.

Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubi-
lee celebrations and weathered
the embarrassment of a nude
photos scandal, after a tabloid
published topless images of the
duchess.
Joe Little, managing editor
of Majesty magazine, said the
news ended a year that saw the
royal family riding high in popu-
lar esteem after celebrations of
Queen Elizabeth II's 60 years on
thethrone.
"People enjoyed the royal
romance last year and now
there's this. It's just a good news
story amid all the doom and
gloom," he said.
In the chilly night air at Lon-
don's Camden market, concert-
goers and shoppers seemed
surprised by the news - though
all agreed that it had been widely
anticipated.
"It feels a lot like a Christmas
present for the nation!" said
Ravitn 'an Den Hil, a Dutch
student studyig in London. "It
makes me feel quite happy."
Others wondered why Britain
continues to spend so much to
support the royal family. "I don't
think ,. a good thing," said Ste-
phen Jowitt as he strolled down
Camden High Street. "It rein-
forces a class system."
The palace said the royal
family was "delighted" by the
news.
British Prime Minister David
Cameron admitted he got a
heads-up about tIe pregnancy,
saying he found the news "quite
difficult" to keep to himself
and expressing confidence the
young couple will make "abso-
lutely brilliant parents."
The pregnancy comes after
a 2011 decision by the leaders
of Britain and the 15 Common-
wealth nations endorsing new
rules that give girls equal status
with boys in the order of succes-
sion. Those changes make Kate's
pregnancy all the more signifi-
cant for the royal fatnily, said
Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief
of Majesty magazine.
"This is the first child who
will be an heir to thethrone,
whatever sex they are," she said.
"It's a new beginning."
Like Kate, William's mother,
Diana, also reportedly suf-
fered from morning sickness
for months, and was the sub-
ject of constant media attention
after she became pregnant just
four months after her wedding
to Prince Charles. "The whole
world is watching my stomach,"
Diana once said.
According to Britain's
Department of Health, severe
morning sickness most often
affects women early in their
pregnancy, and is more common
in young women, women who
are pregnant for the first time
and those expecting multiple
babies.
Dr. Daghni Rajasingam, a
spokeswoman for Britain's
Royal College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists, said women
with severe symptoms - includ-
ing dehydration, dizziness and
persistent vomiting - need to
be hospitalized for treatment,
including being given fluids
intravenously.

Scratches serve as motivation

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
Ten days before he delivered
the shootout winner against Fer-
ris State on Saturday, Luke Mof-
fatt was benched for the first
time since Feb. 25, 2011.
But since his return to the line-
up, the forward has played better

chances on an
offense that looked lethargic at
best for much of November.
"He's playing with more confi-
dence now," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "But I can't tell
you we've got guys who can score
every night."
In the Wolverines' 5-0 loss
to the Bulldogs on Friday in Big
Rapids, Moffatt ripped off five
shots, tied for the most he's had
in a game this season. He also
assisted on freshman forward
Boo Nieves's first-period goal on
Saturday before eventually win-
ning the game using excellent
stick work to maneuver around
Ferris State goaltender C.J.
Motte, who senior captain A.J.
Treais called one of the best in
the CCHA.
Moffatt's lack of early season
production comes as a surprise
after his successful sophomore
campaign. Last year, the Para-
dise Valley, Ariz. native recorded
a career-high 16 points and a
plus/minus rating of plus-four.
But he still hasn't scored a non-
shootout goal this season and is
not playing positive hockey.
Then Friday night, it came as
a bit of a surprise that last year's
co-points leader and CCHA
Rookie of the Year Alex Guptill
didn't make the trip to Big Rap-
ids.
Guptill had certainly been
slumping this season and hasn't
scored since Oct. 27 against

Bigger lineup gives Barnes Arico,
''more options for adjustment

By GREG GARNO
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico has figured out her lineup
quickly.
After six games with the same
starting lineup, the Michigan
women's basketball team made
changes prior to Wednesday's
contest against No. 4 Duke.
The original starting lineup
of senior guards Jenny Ryan
and Kate Thompson, sophomore
guards Nicole Elmblad and Bre-
nae Harris and senior center
Rachel Sheffer accounted for a 5-1
record to begin the season, while
struggling in various facets of the
game, primarily rebounding.
Barnes Arico harped on her
team's struggle to rebound con-
sistently, as Michigan has sur-
vived with an undersized lineup.
As a result, Barnes Arico looked
to add height by replacing Harris
with six-foot senior forward Nya
Jordan.
Barnes Arico, who called
Jordan one of the most athletic
players on the team during the
preseason, first started the for-
ward against Duke. Jordan ended
the game with just eight points
and four rebounds, but against
Florida on Saturday, Jordan led
the team with 11 rebounds.
"I definitely think rebounding
is an issue for us," Barnes Arico
said. "We need to have bigger,
stronger kids out there and Nya
gives us that presence.
"If you saw our last two games,
(Nya) has been a completely dif-
ferent person. I think she really
bought into what we were trying
to do and what lacked and got
her confidence back. I just think
she gives us something we don't
really have. A toughness and ath-
leticism, an extra rebounder on
the court."
But the Wolverines' woes
aren't as bad they think. Despite
having been outrebounded in half
of its games, Michigan has out-
rebounded opponents, 237-230, so
far this season.
So what has Michigan (6-2)
struggled with this season?
Handling pressure.

Josiah Gibbs by Yale
University in 1852.
Yale has a long & continuous
history of engineering success.

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Senior forward Nya Jordan has brought a new presence to the Michigan lineup.

Both of its losses, against Duke
and Utah, were the result of
defensive pressure that threw the
Wolverines out of rhythm. Michi-
gan, which relies on its hot shoot-
ing on the outside from Sheffer
and Thompson to compensate for
its lack of height, shot below its 46
percent season average in its two.
losses.
But the losses highlighted what
happens when Michigan is unable
to set up its offense and wait for
its shot. Instead, the Wolverines
forced quick shots, ultimately
affecting the defense.
"We're getting shots and
opportunities to score instead
of giving them opportunities to
score," Barnes Arico said. "I think
when we go on stretches where
we're scoring, we're not turning
the ball over. When they go on
stretches when they're scoring,
it's usually off of our turnovers or
quick shots."
Barnes Arico's new lineup does
not have the quickness, though, to
handle teams who force Michigan
to play a more up-tempo offense.
Jordan forces the Wolverines into
a different offense that works the
ball down low more frequently.
But in its game against Florida,
Michigan showed what happens

when it doesn't face full-court
pressure, mounting a 12-5 run in
the second half that helped seal
victory.
"They didn't pressure as much
as Duke," Sheffer said. "I think
just being able to execute our
half-court offense and just find
the open person (helps)."
Opposing defenses have not
only applied total team pres-
sure, but have also focused in on
the Wolverines' leading scorers
- Sheffer with 14.9 points per
game and Thompson with 14.6
points per game. Against Duke,
Michigan was forced to find an
alternate source to carry the team
offensively, leaning on Ryan, who
scored 18 points.
But this pressure doesn't sur-
prise Thompson, who managed to
lead Michigan in scoring on Fri-
day with 21 points.
"Every team we play is going
to be very good," Thompson said.
"Defense is goingto get better and
better as the year progress, but if
we just run our offense and really
focus on setting the screens then
people will get open."
But Barnes Arico may have
to ask herself what lineup can
rebound and handle defensive
pressure better.

Michigan hopes to restore Big Ten's battered image

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
The most wonderful time of
the year is just weeks away. Well,
except if you're a Big Ten football
team.
The Big Ten NOTEBOOK
hasn't been
quite so big in recent years come.
bowl season. In 2012, the confer-
ence was a combined 1-4 in New
Year's Day bowls, with three loss-
es to Southeastern Conference
teams. A year prior, the Big Ten
was swept on New Year's Day -
with another three losses to SEC
teams.
After perhaps the conference's
worst-ever regularseason in 2012,
Michigan feels some responsibil-
ity to restore some honor to the
Big Ten. As senior defensive tack-
le Will Campbell put it, "There's
more at stake this year."
The Wolverines are one of
three Big Ten teams that will play
SEC opponents on Jan. 1. All three
are underdogs. In fact, not asingle
team in the Big Ten is favored in
any of the seven bowls its teams
are playingin.

Combined, the conference
is a 53-point underdog, though
the lines do change. The SEC
is favored in all of its nine bowl
games, by a combined 52.5 points.
Currently, No. 19 Michigan is a
4.5-point underdog against No. 11
South Carolina.
The Wolverines are 5-3 against
SEC opponents in the past two
decades. Most recently, Mississip-
pi State handed Michigan a 52-14
loss in the Gator Bowl in 2011, and
in 2008, the Wolverines upset
Tim Tebow and Urban Meyer of
Florida in the Capital One Bowl.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke, nor-
mally focused on Michigan only,
said the team has a responsibility
to represent the conference posi-
tively.
"I think you're playing for
Michigan and your seniors first,
but we're proud to be in the Big
Ten, so why wouldn't (we) want
to represent and that be part of
our focus?" Hoke said. "It would
be really bad for us not to feel that
way about the Big Ten."
GETTING A FEEL FOR CARO-
LINA: Though Michigan holds the
title for 2012's best losses - with

Offensively, the Gamecocks
have been pedestrian, but they
have several imposing defend-
ers, including Jadaveon Clowney,
probably the nation's best defen-
sive end. Behind Clowney, South
Carolina has generated 40 sacks
this season.
Hoke said he has just begun
to break down the film, but he
has already been impressed by
the Gamecocks' athleticism and
defensive front. Clowney will be
blocked by redshirt junior tackles
Taylor Lewan and Michael Scho-
field.
"If you're truly a competitor, I
think it would be a tremendous,
fun opportunity," Hoke said of
blocking Clowney.
But as always, much of the
pregame discussion will center
around the man Clowney will
be chasing. It remains unclear
whether that person will be junior
quarterback Devin Gardner or
senior quarterback Denard Rob-
inson. And Michigan has shown
no indication of changing that.
Robinson injured his right
elbow on Oct. 27 against Nebraska
and hasn't thrown a pass since.

Michigan has used Gardner in
replacement, with Robinson as a
scat back or run-only quarterback
in the final two weeks of the sea-
son. Robinson said that he's "still
not throwing how I normally
throw," but he noted that the time
offwillgivehimanchancetoheal.
"I think it's a great opportunity
for me to get back healthy," Robin-
son said. "I'm feeling pretty good
right now, to be honest with you.
When we start back practicing
I can have more to say, but right
now I feel good."
NOTES: Junior fullback Ste-
phen Hopkins has left the team,
Michigan announced on Monday.
Later in the day, Hopkins tweeted
from his account, "I love the Uni-
versity of Michigan and every-
thing it means to be a Michigan
Man. I look forward to getting
my degree." ... Michigan will run
and lift weights throughout the
week and begin its schedule of 15
allotted practices before the bowl
game on Friday and Saturday; the
Wolverineswill practice againthe

it might be a BTN
prime spot in
the season for
coach John Beilein to add some
complexities to the offense. Right?
"Oh no, no," Beilein said. "We
have enough offensive wrinkles*
right now. We're trying to close
it up a little bit. We need to cut it
down and we're trying to."
That may have been easier to
do if not for the emergence of Nik
Stauskas. The freshman guard
was named Big Ten Freshman of
the Week for the second consecu-
tive week after scoring 22 points
on 4-for-5 3-point shooting in his
first start Saturday, a 74-66 vic-
tory over Bradley. The Ontario
native also dropped 20 points in
Michigan's previous game, Tues-
day's 79-72 win over North Caro-
lina State.
"With the evolution of Nik
Stauskas, well, that opened a new
can of worms to go in one direc-
tionin certainareas," Beileinsaid.
"With Jordan Morgan, and Jon
Horford, Max Bielfeldt and Mitch
(McGary),thatwas anotherthing,

a lot in the package. We need to
shorten it up."
Of the four big men, Morgan

rebounds Saturday. He sees 20

Michigan coach John Beilein and Michigan are off to a sterling 7-0 start.

minutes per game, with the other
half distributed among the other
three. McGary has been the first
forward off the bench in each
game, usually replacing Morgan
five minutes into the game. Hor-
ford is usually the nextin line, but
Saturday, Beilein played Bielfeldt
for nine minutes because the red-
shirt freshman was returning to
his native Peoria.
Future playing time, however,
is up in the air.
"We'll evaluate every practice,"
Beilein said. "We'll keep looking
at that."
In both games last week, the
Wolverines (7-0) saw bigleadslate
in the second half evaporate in a
hurry. A 68-53 lead with just over
four minutes left became 70-65
in the final minute against Brad-
ley. Tuesday, another 15-point
lead with under six minutes to
play was shrunk to five before the
Wolverines closed it out.
"We haven't been really
focused out there, to me, in my
eyes," said junior guard Tim
Hardaway Jr. "That just comes
with practice. Just got to get more
practice, get more reps in situa-
tions where we're up by a lot or up
by a certain amount of points."
A comfortable lead is some-

thing Michigan can expect to
have tomorrow night against
Western Michigan. A close game
at the end is something the rest of
us can expect won't happen.
Though the Broncos are 6-1,
they've scarcely been tested. Cor-
nell took them down in the sea-
son opener, and since, Western
Michigan has been able to brush
by South Florida, High Point and
Oakland by single digits.
. Senior forward Nate
Hutcheson leads the underclass-
men-heavy team with nearly 14
points per game, which doesn't
match sophomore point guard
Trey Burke, Hardaway or Staus-
kas's output.
After a series of high-energy
games, including a hostile road
game, the North Carolina State
contest, aswell as the tournament
in Madison Square Garden, a
matchup with Western Michigan
would seem to be a step down in
terms of intensity.
Again, nonsense as far as
Beilein is concerned.
"When you walk out in our
building and we have great fans,
the energy is easily created. And
now it's a state team. We have a
lot of pride in being able to play
aoinstoeamwithinthe state."
