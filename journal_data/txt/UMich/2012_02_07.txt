Faculty question
UMHS, DPS after
six-month delay in
reporting incident
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
DailyStaffReporter
Following the recent
announcement that the
Department of Education and
the Joint Commission will be
launching a review of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Health
System for its six month delay
in reporting that a medical
resident possessed of child
pornography, the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs used its weekly meet-
ing to discuss the role of the
Department of Public Safety in
criminal incidents at the Uni-
versity.
Law Prof. Richard Fried-
man, a member of the DPS
Oversight Committee - a
group of faculty, staff and
students that advise Univer-
sity officials on incidents filed
against DPS officers - spoke
to SACUA to clarify the role of

DPS and the committee in the
ongoing investigation.
During his address to
SACUA, Friedman explained
that the Michigan State Leg-
islature established oversight
committees in 1990 to inde-
pendently oversee actions of
University police forces. The
University's DPS Oversight
Committee makes recommen-
dations to Timothy- Slottow,
the University's executive vice
president and chief financial
officer, when complaints are
filed against DPS.
After a female resident dis-
covered a flash drive contain-
ing child pornography that
belonged to former medical
resident Stephen Jenson, she
reported the incident to hos-
pital security rather than DPS.
Friedman said security per-
sonnel at UHMS are not part
of DPS and therefore not under
the oversight committee's
jurisdiction.
"If they are not within DPS,
they are just not our job," he
said. "They do report ultimate-
ly to DPS, but they are not offi-
cers, they are employees."

Detroit squatters
may be allowed to
keep their homes
Wayne County will send people
door-to-door to offer thousands
of foreclosed Detroit homes for as
little as $500, a move that would
keep a roof over the head of squat-
ters and possibly get properties
back on the tax rolls.
More than 6,000 Detroit
homes, foreclosed because taxes
weren't paid, didn't sell at auction
last fall. The county treasurer's
office doesn't want to see them
abandoned and is willing to nego-
tiate with anyone living inside,
including owners who no longer
have a right to the property.
"A vacant house is not going to
help anybody," deputy treasur-
er Eric Sabree told The Detroit

Swiss bank Julius
Baer expects fine
in U.S. tax case
Swiss bank Julius Baer Group
said yesterday that it might have
to pay a fine to settle allegations it
helped American clients cheat on
their taxes, but cautioned inves-
tors that the final outcome of the
case was still uncertain.
Zurich-based Julius Baer is one
of at least 11 Swiss banks under
pressure from the U.S. to give up
tax-evading American customers
" and the bankers who aided them.
Last month, Switzerland's oldest
bank, Wegelin & Co, announced
it was selling most of its business
after it was indicted in the U.S.
with conspiring to help American
clients hide more than $1.2 billion
from the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice.
"We're in ongoing full coop-
eration and dialogue with the U.S.
authorities and we're confident
and committed that we. will find
a solution," Julius Baer's Chief
Executive Boris Collardi said dur-
ing the presentation of the bank's
full-year results yesterday.

Bulgarian dam
bursts killing eight
A dam in southern Bulgaria
burst yesterday after days of
. heavy rain, sending an eight-foot-
high (2.5-meter) torrent surging
through a village along the Greek
border. The disaster brought the
region's toll from floodingto eight
dead, 10 missing.
The dam on the Ivanovo Res-
ervoir collapsed, flooding 700
houses inthe village of Bisser, civil
defense chief Nikolai Nikolovsaid.
Four bodies were found in the rag-
ing waters, three of them elderly
men, the Bisser mayor reported.
A reporter at Bisser saw the
muddy water crashing into
homes, tossing cars, drowning
animals and uprooting trees.
Many homes were destroyed and
some residents had to climb onto
their roofs to escape.
Many in Bisser had to be res-
cued from their water-logged
homes and were spending the
night in emergency shelters.
Officials were still assessing the

damage late yesterday.

Daily wire reports

ambassador to
Damascus
BEIRUT (AP) - The U.S.
closed its embassy in Syria and
Britain recalled its ambassador
to Damascus yesterday in a new
Western push to get President
Bashar Assad to leave power
and halt the murderous grind in
Syria - now among the deadliest
conflicts of the Arab Spring.
Although the diplomatic effort
was stymied at the U.N. by vetoes
fromRussiaand Chinathe moves
by the U.S. and Britain were a
clear message that Western pow-
ers see no point in engaging with
Assad and now will seek to bol-
ster Syria's opposition.
"This is a doomed regime as
well as a murdering regime,"
British Foreign Secretary Wil-
liam Hague told lawmakers as
he recalled his country's ambas-
sador from Syria. "There is no
way it can recover its credibility
internationally."
President Barack Obama said
the Syrian leader's departure is
only a matter of time.
"We have been relentless in

sending a message that it is time
for Assad to go," Obama said dur-
ing an interview with NBC. "This
is not going to be a matter of if, it's
going to be a matter of when."
The most serious violence
Monday was reported in Homs,
where Syrian government forces,
using tanks and machine guns,
shelled a makeshift medical clinic
and residential areas on the third
dayofarelentless assault, killinga
reported 40 people, activists said.
More than a dozen others were
reported killed elsewhere.
Those deaths followed a
regime onslaught in Homs that
began Saturday, the same day
Syria's allies in Russia and China
vetoed a Western- and Arab-
backed resolution aimed at trying
to end the crackdown on dissent.
Some 200 people died, the high-
est death toll reported for a single
day in the uprising, according to
several activistgroups.
Even as the U.S. steps up pres-
sure on Assad to halt the violence
and relinquish power, Obama
said a negotiated solution was
possible, without recourse to
outside military intervention.
Later, however, White House
spokesman Jay Carney said the
administration was taking "no

options off the table."
In a signal thatthe window for
diplomatic efforts may at some
point close, Carney said: "We
need to act to allow a peaceful
political transition to go forward
before the regime's escalating
violence puts a political solution
out of reach."
U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford
and 17 other U.S. officials left
Syria on Monday, arriving in
Amman, Jordan, several hours
later. Ford was to travel on to
Paris to spend time with his wife,
the State Department said.
As part of what was clearly a
concerted Western effort, the
Italian Foreign Ministry said
it had also summoned Syria's
ambassador in Rome to express
"the strongest condemnation ...
over the unacceptable acts of vio-
lence perpetrated by the regime
of Damascus against the civilian
population."
More than 5,400 people have
been killed in Syria since the
uprising began in March, the
U.N. said early last month. Hun-
dreds more are believe to have
been killed since then, but the
U.N. says the chaos itt the coun-
try has made it impossible to
cross-check the figures.

Occupy movement
faces second wave
of forced evictions,

Protesters in
Washington,
Miami, others
forced to leave
PORTLAND, Maine - A tent
city that's among the longest-
lived Occupy protest encamp-
ments is coming down as part
of a new wave of eviction
orders against demonstrators
aligned with the movement in
communities including Miami,
Washington and Pittsburgh.
Occupy Maine demonstra-
tots removed several large
tents over the weekend, and the
city yesterday gave them addi-
tional time to remove the rest.
Demonstrators who estab-
lished the encampment just
two weeks after the Occupy
Wall Street encampment set up
shop in New York City vowed
to continue their work to call
attention to corporate excess
and economic inequality.
'rJust because the occupation
is changing form doesn't mean
it's going away," Heather Curtis,
one of the campers, said yes-
terday before she started haul-
ing away her belongings from
snow-covered Lincoln Park.
The encampments that were
the heart of the movement are
becoming scarcer. Yesterday, a
judge issued what appeared to
be the final notice for Occupy
Pittsburgh to leave. Over the
past week, police began remov-
ing demonstrators in Miami;
Austin, Texas; and Washing-
ton, D.C.
The voices are still making
themselves heard, though.
Yesterday, about 20 dem-
onstrators disrupted a legisla-

tive budget hearing in Albany,
N.Y., shouting that millionaires
should be taxed more. Albany's
camp was busted up in Decem-
ber.
Occupy Maine, which already
has office space elsewhere in
Portland, plans to continue get-
ting its message out through
other means, as well.
"You can only fight for so
long and you realize at the end
that it's a new beginning," said
Deese Hamilton, one of the
four named plaintiffs in a law-
suit aiming to keep protesters
in Lincoln Park. Hamilton was
homeless before joining with
the Occupy protesters.
The. campers were sup-
posed to be out by yesterday
morning, and they dismantled
four to five communal tents
over the weekend. But 16 tents
remained yesterday morn-
ing, and the city granted the
group's request for more time,
giving them until Friday to fin-
ish the cleanup.
There was little activity in the
morning. But by the afternoon,
several people were raking, and
others were taking down tents.
"They've asked for this
amount of time in order to
remove the remaining struc-
tures, so we're taking them at
their word," said Nicole Clegg,
city spokeswoman.
Occupy Maine started up Oct.
1 with a protest in Portland's

Lincoln Park two days later.
Throughout the frigid Maine
winter, when temperatures have

ers rotated in and out to keep a
constant presence, with those in
the park keeping the cold at bay
by huddling in communal tents
equipped with propane heaters.

agreement between
Abbas and Mashaal
RAMALLAH, West Bank
(AP) - Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas took a deci-
sive step yesterday toward rec-
onciliation with the Islamic
militant Hamas, agreeing to
head an interim unity govern-
ment that would prepare for
elections in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
The announcement imme-
diately threw Mideast peace
efforts into turmoil. By mov-
ing closer to Hamas, the Pal-
estinian leader appeared to be
closing the door, for now, to
any possibility of peace talks
with Israel - although all such
efforts have failed to get off the
ground during Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanya-
hu's three years in office.
Netanyahu condemned yes-
terday's deal, saying it would be

inpossible to reach peace with
a government that includes
Hamas, which Israel and the
West consider a terrorist group.
"It is either peace with
Hamas or peace with Israel.
You can't have them both,"
Netanyahu said.
A new attempt to restart low-
level talks last month ended
without a breakthrough. With
the reconciliation deal, Abbas
appears to have concluded that
he has a better chance of repair-
ing the Palestinians' internal
troubles than of reaching an
agreement with the hardline
Israeli leader.
The Palestinians have been
divided between rival govern-
ments since Hamas ousted
forces loyal to Abbas from Gaza
in 2007.
Yesterday's agreement, bro-
kered by Qatar, seemed to bring
reconciliation within reach for
the first time. Previous deals
have collapsed amid deep sus-
picions and intervention by
the sides' rival foreign patrons.

Abbas is backed by the West
while Hamas has been support-
ed by Iran.
Abbas and Hamas chief
Khaled Mashaal said they
would move forward without
delay, though it appears unlike-
ly elections can be held in May,
as initially envisioned.
The two Palestinian leaders
had reached a reconciliation
deal last year, but disagreement
over who was to head an inter-
im government had delayed
implementation. Hamas
strongly opposed Abbas' choice
of Salam Fayyad, the head of
his Palestinian Authority in the
West Bank.
It remains unclear whether
an Abbas-led interim gov-.
ernment that is supported by
Hamas would be acceptable to
the West, which gives hundreds
of millions of dollars of aid to
the Palestinians each year. The
United States and Europe have
said they would shun any gov-
ernment that includes members
of an unreformed Hamas.

Keep carp at bay
Midwest states must stop invasive species
T he ongoing threat to the Great Lakes' ecosystem posed by
Asian carp was revisited this past week in several ways. Last
Tuesday, a panel of engineering and environmental experts
convened in Huron, Ohio for a public forum to discuss possible solu-
tions to the threat. The same day, news outlets reported the findings
of a recent study co-sponsored by the Great Lakes Commission (GLC)
and the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Cities Initiative (GLSLCI). The fed-
eral government and affected state governments should use the find-
ings to determine the most cost-effective solution to the Asian carp
problem before it grows beyond their control.

The report was released in the -wake of
increasing public concern over carp sight-
ings near the juncture of the Great Lakes and
Mississippi River basins. The Commission's
report calls for the immediate separation of
the basins with a barrier designed to keep out
the pesky carp. It also offers three alterna-
tives to the plan in hopes that a compromise
can be reached. Since the plan would force
the city of Chicago to overhaul its waterway
system, a number of Chicago business owners
and representatives are opposed to the sepa-
ration and its potential effects on the falter-
ing Illinois economy.
Asian carp are well-known for their'habit
of consuming massive amounts of plankton,
an organism that's essential to the survival of
native fish species and the Great Lakes' fishing
industry, which generates $7 billion in annual
activity for the local economy. The carp are
also known to jump out of the water violently
when startled by nearby fishing boats, which
puts recreational fishermen at risk for serious
injuries. Once the carp are able to establish a
young breeding population in an ecosystem,
it's virtually impossible to eradicate them.
This means the welfare of nearly all the native
fish of the Great Lakes - and the wildlife that

feed on them - is at stake.
The Great Lakes region may be forced to
make a considerable investment in the barrier,
but the project would pay for itself over time.
Efforts to control invasive species already
cost local economies more than $150 million a
year. Though the cheapest solution the study
proposes would cost between $3.26 and $4.27
billion to implement, it is also projected to gen-
erate up to $9.5 billion in long-term savings.
The overhaul of Chicago's shipping facilities
could also generate $400 million in economic
benefits for the city's ports, and the entire sep-
aration effort could create thousands of much-
needed jobs.
There's not much time for local represen-
tatives to act on these measures. Asian carp
have crept steadily closer toward the Great
Lakes via the Mississippi River ince the
1990s. According to the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, there are currently as many as 10
invasive species on the verge of overtaking
the Great Lakes. The spread of Asian carp
would permanently damage Michigan's fish-
ing and tourism industries. The state govern-
ment needs to act on recent findings and take
appropriate steps to prevent the invasion of
Asian carp before it's too late.

ast week, The Michigan
Daily highlighted the Uni-
versity's strides toward a
greener campus.
In June 2010,
the University
implemented
a LEED Silver
standard for all
new fconstruc-
tion projects
on campus.
LEED stands JOE
for Leadership SUGIYAMA
in Energy and - -- --
Environmental
Design, and is a special certifica-
tion given only to environmentally
sound buildings. The results have
been tremendous, considering that
large-scale projects, such as the C.S.
Mott Children's and von Voigtland-
er Women's Hospital and the Ross
School of Business, have achieved
this acclaimed, environmentally
friendly standing. That being said,
the University would do itself a dis-
service if it chose to look only at
future buildings' carbon footprints,
while ignoring those already in exis-
tence.
Credit must be given when due,
and the University's LEED initiative
should be viewed asa great first step.
The new hospital's LEED Silver cer-
tification is inspiring - a green roof,
no-wax floors and a plethora of recy-
cled materials used during the con-
struction process. These measures
have led to energy savings, efficient
water usage and a reduction in car-
bon dioxide emissions.
While nothing can be taken away
from what the University has accom-
plished, simply requiring LEED
status for new buildings is too restric-
tive. The University should now turn
its attention to existing buildings on
campus in order to truly be a leader

in sustainability.
There are countless ways to
improve existing buildings on cam-
pus. In fact, the U.S. Green Building
Council has an 84-page document
on this very topic. As it turns out,
many of the buildings on campus are
currently in an advantageous posi-
tion when it comes to getting certi-
fied. Going the extra mile is not only
an obtainable goal, but also a neces-
sary one.
Items such as the smoking ban,
automatic light sensors and recycling
options have given many Univer-
sity buildings a head start to achieve
LEED accreditation. Each one of
these green-minded innovations is
on the USGBC's project checklist for
LEED certification of existing build-
ings. With a little tweaking here and
there, the University has the capabil-
ity of becoming one of the greenest
campuses in the nation.
The University should focus its
funding on LEED points that are
either cheaply achieved - such as
using environmentally friendly
cleaning products and fertilizers -
or have a direct impact on energy
costs, including low-flow water fix-
tures, heating reduction and electric-
ity reduction measures.
Many of these steps will require
a large amount of capital, but the
USGBC claims that the pay-back
period for LEED certification ranges
from three to 10 years. For an insti-
tution as large as the University, this
is a more than acceptable range -
keeping in mind that once pay-back
is achieved, the annual savings in
energy reduction can be viewed as an
income of sorts.
If a mere 34 of the possible 85
LEED points are met, the University
would have another innovative brag-
ging point for prospective applicants
and donors.

Though LEED certification is a
great goal to have in mind, it is not
the end-all, be-all of green living.
Some of the buildings on campus are
over 100 years old, and it may not be
possible to implement such a rigor-
ous system. But that does not mean
nothing can be done. The University
should view the USGBC's guidelines
as a blueprint for a possible best-case
scenario and attempt to apply its con-
cepts pragmatically.
Existing campus
buildings should
go green, too.
There are many simple fixes.that
could do the trick. Turning off the
lights in the upper levels of Angell
Hall at a reasonable hour or ensuring
that classrooms are of an appropri-
ate size for the number of students
in a course could significantly lower
electricity costs and carbon emis-
sions. Low-flow fixtures are a proven
method of saving money on water
costs and reducing the amount of
wastewater produced.
The University has an obligation
as an institution to implement this
sort of progressive thinking. The
steps are already in place to proceed
into a sustainable, greener world. A
little improvement paired with criti-
cal cost-analysis could go a long way
in saving some scratch and helping
the environment.

Teaching for a cause

ANDREI S. MARKOVITS I
Sports coexist with education

Caitlin Huston, author of "Teach for
America: A two-year crash course" and "TFA
Detroit: A $3,000 gamble" was correct when
she said that Teach for America corps mem-
bers have a chance to make an impact in one
of the country's most disadvantaged school
districts. She was right when she mentioned
that the district is in financial despair. And,
she was right to mention that Detroit schools
lack resources.
One fact that she neglected to mention
though was the positive effect that Teach
for America teachers have on the Detroit
schools. In many TFA classrooms across
the city, teachers are improving reading and
math scores by several grade levels in one
year. Teach for America teachers are getting
their students involved in activities and com-
munity groups across the city to stand up for
better opportunities. Moreover, teachers are
working incredibly hard with their students
to help prepare them to advance on to college
and expand their life opportunities.
Huston is right when she mentions that
being a teacher is hard work. Yet, as a 2010
graduate from the University's Ford School
of Public Policy, I can assure you I was pre-
pared to work in this high stakes environ-
ment. I gained skills at the University that
would allow me to teach my students at a
rigorous level, and I gained knowledge that
would allow me to hook my students into
every lesson. I currently attend the Univer-

sity's Masters in Education program where
I continue to learn valuable skills that allow
me to take my students to the next level.
I teach high school civics and economics
at Crockett Technical High School in Detroit.
My students gain knowledge in economics and
government and leave my class understanding
what rights theyhave, how to stand up for what
they believe in and how to be productive mem-
bers of society. This past year, 82 percent of my
students left my class proficient in economics.
They spoke at Detroit City Council meetings,
met with the districts's Emergency Financial
Manager to discuss improvements in their
school and wrote letters to our Congressmen
advocating for a better education. Yes, we lack
resources, but our students come determined
to learn every day.
Through my TFA experience, I have been
challenged, I have grown and I have learned
an immense amount about the city of Detroit
and its vibrant residents. Detroit is poised to
enter a new renaissance, but we must ensure
that more of our students are receiving the
educational opportunities theydeserve. Teach
For America is offering one additional source
of effective educators, and we are working,
relentlessly alongside our talented veteran
colleagues to make a difference for our kids.
Amanda Canvasser is a Master's student
in the School of Education. She is a 2010
Teach For America corps member.

The spate of recent criticisms
regarding college sports - mean-
ing the big-time revenue makers of
football and men's basketball, with
few worries allotted to swimming
or gymnastics - center on two
arguments: that their behemoth
existence is detrimental to the Uni-
versity's mission of education and
scholarship, and their prominence
in University life is new. Neither
claim is true.
As to the former, the growth of
these two sports in the course of the
post-World War II era also coincides
with the emergence of the American
university as the envy of the world.
According to two surveys conducted
on a yearly basis, "Top 400 - The
Times Higher Education World Uni-
versity Rankings" and "QS Top 500
Universities" American universities
have consistently been present in
both. There are 20 U.S. universities
among the top 50 in the QS ranking
and 30 U.S. universities among the
top 50 in the Times Higher Educa-
tion ranking.
A quick glance at these American
universities will reveal a substantial
number of institutions in which big-
time Division-I college football and
men's basketball play a key role, and
have done so for decades. Among
these are eminent institutions such
as Stanford University; the Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley; the Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles; the
University of Michigan; the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin; the University of
Texas and Duke University.
Yes, the University of Chicago,
the California Institute of Technol-
ogy, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Ivy League schools
- including Harvard University,
Yale University, Princeton Univer-
sity and Columbia University - do.
have both of these sports, among
many others, but arguably they
have come to play a less salient role
in these institutions' identities than
in the other schools'.
Moreover, a brief look at much-

discussed Penn State University will
reveal that parallel to this univer-
sity's growth in football prominence
under the aegis of the late Joe Pater-
no, a comparable, if not even more
impressive, growth in this institu-
tion's stature as a leading research
university on both national and
international levels occurred.
With the faculties of most Ameri-
can universities now more accom-
plished, more professionally active,
more published and more diverse
over the past four decades, and with
greater student competition for
admission, an argument can be made
that today's American university
is -intellectually and professionally
superior to its erstwhile predecessor.
Concerning the second point,
there exists ample evidence that
football and other sports, such as
rowing and baseball, became cen-
tral ingredients of American col-
lege existence by the early 1860s. As
sport historians John A. Lucas and
Ronald A. Smith (individually and
jointly) have amply shown, virtually
all the ills that we currently bemoan
sports to have corrupted the integ-
rity of our universities' educational
mission existed in college football
of the late 19th century: financial
favors to sub-freshmen recruits,
constant violations of eligibility
rules, bowing to alumni interests
and outside boosters, payment of
professional coaches well beyond
faculty salaries and sports budgets
far exceeding those of large depart-
ments and even entire schools.
For example, Yale's income from
footballin1903equaled the combined
budgets of the law, divinity and med-
ical schools. The reason for this was
clear then and remains clear now:
product differentiation. Ameri-
ca's nine colonial colleges emulated
oxford and Cambridge Universities,
including playing sports. But unlike
Oxford and Cambridge, wh ose prod-
uct needed no particular distinction
in the then still sparse world of Brit-
ish higher education, this was not the

case with their American imitators.
Here, the need for differentiation
among a greater number of univer-
sities became a necessity, especially
with the considerable growth in
institutions of higher education fol-
lowing the passing of the Morrill
Land-Grant Act signed into law by
President AbrahamLincoln in 1862.
Sports came to play a crucial role
increation of these institutions' iden-
tities. When Columbia won a regatta
on Lake Saratoga in 1874, President
Frederick Barnard congratulated
the team by saying that this victory
would carry the name of Columbia
to far-away placeslike Paris, London,
Hong Kong and Kolkata. And one
year later, Cornell President Andrew
White welcomed his victorious row-
ers with flying flags and the Univer-
sity chimes a-ringing.
Moreover, sports proved a great
social equalizer. Young men from
rural backgrounds and modest
means attending the newly-formed
land grant colleges could - and
often did - defeat rivals hailing
from privilege and money, precisely
because even then, sports were bet-
ter understood and more avidly fol-
lowed by the vast majority of the
public than physics or philosophy.
Harvard's construction of its horse-
shoe shaped, concrete-based stadi-
um in 1903 was much better known
and more'prominently covered than
its 40 endowed professorships.
This has not changed. Nor has the
desire to utilize a sport's popularity
to enhance a school's name recogni-
tion and identity-building. Sports
became unique fixtures of American
higher education and do not exist
in this form anywhere else in the
world, including in the education
systems of America's English-speak-
ing cousins. Sports have long coex-
isted with the American university's
scholarly mission and will continue
to do so in the future.

The cards will dictate the future

ometimes when I finish
crocheting on icy Wednes-
day evenings, I build
houses of cards.
This pastime helps me reflect
on the day
gone by and
allows me to
contemplate
other issues
- such as the
prospects of
the Michigan
men's basket-e
ball team the NEAL
remainder of ROTHSCHILD
the season.
The Wol-
verines have a certain formula
they use to win games. They
rely on penetration from their
guards to create open shots for
their shooters. But when they
can't find penetration or hit
their shots, they wind up look-
ing much like my cards in my
amateur years of building.
Allow me to let you in on a
few tricks of the card-building
trade. Glue works. I success-
fully build houses every time I
add a dose of Elmer's to my con-
struction. That's not the only
way I can build one, but it sure
does help matters.
In the same way, this team
finds success under specific cir-
cumstances. The most promi-
nent of those conveniently
involves a house, but one not
made of spades and diamonds.
Rather, it's the House that
Cazzie Built.
The Wolverines are unbeaten
at'home and have looked like a
different team than the travel-
ing version of the squad. They
have been PT Cruisin' at the
Crisler Center this season,
where they've put up a 14-0
mark. But in visiting arenas,
they are a rather underwhelm-
ing 1-6.
The Indiana team that Mich-
igan fell to in Bloomington the
first week of the year was the
same one it beat at Crisler by 12
points last week. And the same
Michigan State team that lost to
the Wolverines three weeks ago
had no problem with Michigan
at the Breslin Center on Sunday,
as the Spartans swag-stepped
to a 10-point victory.
No explanation can help
me understand how a team
can play the same exact sport
under the same exact rules, so
much more poorly in a differ-

Michigan freshman guard Trey Burke is the ace in the Michigan basketball team's deck. But he alone won't be enough.

ent venue. Yet, I'll agree that
there's something real about
home-court advantage.
Luckily for Michigan, the
meaningful games it plays this
season won't be in opposing
arenas. But unluckily for Michi-
gan, those games also won't be
at home.
So, just like glue isn't allowed
at my quarterly card-building
competitions, the Big Ten Tour-
nament and NCAA Tournament
are held at neutral sites.
For these games, the dark
magic of home-court advan-
tage isn't around to haunt my
dreams. It's at these times that
Michigan will have to win
games on its own merit.
When the time comes, Michi-
gan will have to face the conse-
quences of its lack of depth in
the post.Redshirt sophomore
center Jordan Morgan is the
only person able to defend
elite big men in the post. And
when he tried to do that a week
ago, Ohio State knocked him
around. After picking up four
fouls, Morgan had to spend
much of the second half on the
bench.
With sophomore center Jon
Horford nursing a.foot injury

that looks to keep him side-
lined for the rest of the season,
Michigan's only alternatives
to guard the Meyers Leonards,
and Jared Sullingers remaining
on the regular-season sched-'
ule are slight sophomore Evan
Smotrycz and perimeter-dwell-
ing junior Blake McLimans.
And when the games that
matter come around, Michigan
must deal with the reality that
its most prolific shooter may
also be its worst. Sophomore
forward Tim Hardaway Jr. has
taken 46 more 3-pointers than
senior guard Zack Novak and
he's made two fewer.
. Hardaway continues to play
like his father (circa 2035)
and it's hurting Michigan. His
questionable shot selection and
turbulent emotions (and resem-
blance to Chris Rock) have put
the Wolverines in a funny posi-
tion.
Michigan coach John Beilein
has reiterated his faith in the
sophomore, but that faith has
scarcely been rewarded in Big
Ten play. If Hardaway keeps on
gunning, he might just shoot
the Wolverines out of Big Ten
title contention or postseason
tournament play.

How freshman point guard
Trey Burke performs down the
stretch will also have important
implications. Early in my card-
building days, I would fatigue
when I neared completion of
one of my mansions. My hands
would tremble, and I found it
difficult to place my cards like I
was used to.
Burke may be at risk of some-
thing similar. He has had more
difficulty getting into the lane
in recent games, and though his
numbers haven't been affected
because he's been draining
threes, he does not look as
explosive off the dribble.
The Wolverines may not look
to be in such bad shape now, sit-
ting comfortably at third place
in the conference with a rela-
tively cushy schedule ahead.
Still, their hopes for even
greater glory in March rest on
a few cards - on threes (by
Hardaway), a five (position-
wise) in Morgan and an ace in
Burke.
And if, somehow, the house
hasn't fallen, King Beilein
winds up on top.

Daily Sports Editor
You probably haven't noticed
the Michigan hockey player
wearing the No. 24 sweater, so
here's an introduction: his name
is Jon Merrill, he's a sophomore
defender, and he's pretty decent.
Jokes, jokes. Of course you've
noticed Merrill, Michigan's best
all-around talent and brightest
professional prospect by a lofty
margin. His return from a three-
month-long suspension has coin-
cided with Michigan's current
6-1-1 tear through the CCHA that
has put the Wolverines just three
points behind first-place Ferris
State.
You know Merrill. Just don't
tell him - for his own sake.
"I just try to keep it simple and
try to - try not to get noticed,
really," Merrill said. "As a defen-
seman, you want to go out there,
(and) you don't want anyone to
notice you've been out there."
Mission not quite accom-
plished. Or is it?
Merrill's return made a big
splash because he's one of Michi-
gan's best players, and it's contin-
ued to generate buzz because of
the team's success with him in the
lineup. Yet players such as sopho-
more forward Luke Moffatt said
the 6-foot-3 Merrill makes a big
impact because he's inconspicu-
ous on the ice.
Moffatt had a hard time
articulating what Merrill does
for Michigan. At one point, he
described Merrill as "a presence."
Other times, he said the opposite.
"He's a little more, I wouldn't
say steady, but snore..." Moffatt
said, his voice trailing off. "Pas-
sive? I don't know what the right
word is there."
In measurable terms, Merrill's
contributions are much clearer.
He's big, physical and talented.
He can move the puck to forwards
quickly or fire shots through the
defense.
Merrill and junior defenseman
Lee Moffie have complemented
each other well. Moffie prefers to
fire shots on cage and attack the
goal on rushes. Merrill is content
to stay back.
And both special-teams units
have made giant leaps in pro-

duction after Merrill's return.
Against Miami this past week-
end, the penalty kill thwarted all
12 of the RedHawks' power plays,
while Michigan scored twice.
Merrill assisted on both goals.
"He's a top defenseman, and
we knew that coming in when he
got to play again," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson.
Michigan's goals-against aver-
age is more than 1.3 goals better
with Merrill than without. That
can't all be because of one player,
can it?
The short answer: no.
As Berenson noted, the Wol-
verines caught fire during the
Great Lakes Invitational, and
Merrill's return the following
series just added fuel to said fire.
Few players, especially defen-
semen, are worth 1.3 goals per
game. Yet Merrill's name in the
lineup is worth more than its
weight in goals because of the
depth he adds.
Plus there's that on-ice pres-
ence. Moffatt fumbled through
words like "passive" and "steady."
Maybe it's just Merrill's confi-
dence, which shines through in
his statements:
"We don't look it at as some-
thing that's bad, we kind of get
excited when we have to kill a
penalty. We get momentum out
of it."
Or:
"It's unbelievable when you
string a couple wins together,
beat some good teams. The locker
room, the morale is up, everyone's
excited. And going into games,
instead of in November when we
thought we were going to lose
every game, it's now we know
we're going to win every game."
Berenson said Merrill and his
teammates enjoy a symbiotic rela-
tionship, just like any player on a
well-functioning team. Merrill
makes the team better, and the
team also makes Merrill better.
But his impact was visible to
anyone who witnessed the con-
trast in the Wolverines' play this
weekendto when they met Miami
in November.
November's Michigan team
lacked a calming presence in a
fast and physical series in a hos-
tile environment.
It got one back in Merrill.

last May, providing a rare oppor- tion in his program, we need to

understand the opportunity we
have as Team One. There's going
to be a Team 132 in lacrosse one
day, and they're going to look
back and remember the number
of teams that have been through
this."
As a varsity team, the Wolver-
ines will face much stiffer com-
petition.
In light of this, Paul is taking a
long-term approach to coaching
his team.
"We've made it our mis-
sion this year to build an elite
Division-I culture," Paul said.
"And that doesn't necessarily
mean that we're winning every
Division-I game, it means we're
building this culture that's going
to lay the foundation for what

this program is going to become."
Junior Sean Sutton expressed
a similar sentiment about the
turbulent transitional phase.
"We expect the competition to
be a higher level, obviously," he
said. "But we're going to do what
we can control, and that's getting
better each and every day. We
have no expectations of wins and
losses right now.
"We're just trying to work to
get that culture established, and
trying to set the culture that will
bring us to a great program some
day."
Paul will need serious com-
mitment from his players mov-
ing forward if the Wolverines
hope to have success. The switch
to Division I places new demands

on his players.
Most of the players of the
Michigan lacrosse team didn't
sign on to compete at a varsity
level, coming to Michigan with
the expectation of playing club
lacrosse. Suddenly, thrust into
Division I, their upcoming sea-
son includes many more respon-
sibilities than they're used to
handling.
It remains to be seen whether
these new responsibilities will
be fulfilled moving forward. So
far, Paul seems pleased with the
team's development. Last Satur-
day, Michigan participated in an
exhibition match against Divi-
sion-III Denison and came out
with a 12-8 victory.
"We had a lot of young guys

stepping up," Paul said. "We
had guys playing out of position
that had to step up. From the
perspective of guys stepping up
in their roles today, I thought it
went really well."
Regardless of the team's final
record this year, the season will
be a remarkable one due to its
historic nature. For the players,
this represents a dream come
true.
"(Being a Division-I athlete)
is surreal," said fifth-year senior
Trevor Yealy. "I would have
never guessed it. When I started
here, I would have never thought
that I'd have the opportunity
and the privilege to do this. It's a
privilege, it's an honor, it's excit-
ing."

effects.
Most songs off of Paralytic
Stalks, however, remain some-
what coherent. "Dour Percent-
age" is a laid-back, flute-filled
nod to the disco era and "Malefic
Dowery" is a sunny, tropical ditty.
They sound melodic and dreamy,
and they feature classic of Mon-
treal falsetto and funk, but damn
it Barnes is at it again, rambling on
about torment and hostility. "We
Will Commit Wolf Murder" is
another track that has a smooth-
er, more easy-going tone, but
throughout the song, Barnes slips
in little warnings of "there's blood
in my hair." In the lastcouple min-
utes of the song, Barnes seems fed
up, ending with a thrashing spurt
of electronic gibberish while he
repeats his blood-related com-
plaint and finally saying, "fuck."
It's understandable if you put
off listening to Paralytic Stalks.
The album is taxing on the ears
and brain - even longtime of
Montreal fans may be reluctant
to sit through Barnes's disjointed
rant about infinite anguishes and
frustrations. But while the album
doesn't exactly end on a positive
note (honestly, just skip the last
track), it has its moments of men-
tal and musical clarity. Paralytic
Stalks isn't an album you're going
to find on the radio, but embrac-
ing it with an open mind grants
the opportunity to explore the
various mental states of a colorful
character.

The Super Bowl is over,

cans turn their eyes toward to

"Glenn Close or Meryl Streep?"
(They're different people,
right?) And that oh-so-impor-
tant question: Who's hosting the
Oscars party?
I may be hyping the event a bit
out of proportion, but what's true
is that the debate ensues because
we each have our own opinion
about who deserves to win, who
does not deserve the golden stat-
uette and, crucially, who went
overlooked (what, no Oscar nod
for "Tintin"?).
I have a complaint as well.
For whatever reason, the Acad-
emy lost its way when it came to
the category of original score.
When filling out that section on
your Oscars ballots come Feb.
25, you'll find such names as
John Williams (twice), Ludovic
Bource, Howard Shore and
Alberto Iglesias. You will not,
I regret to say, find the name of
one Trent Reznor.
Reznor, the sole permanent
member, producer and singer-
songwriter of the musical group
Nine Inch Nails, together with
longtime collaborator and pro-
ducer Atticus Ross, won the
Oscar for 2010's "The Social Net-
work" - the duo's first foray into
movies. But, more importantly,
they are two of the most original
and groundbreaking film com-

Dog ditches nostalgia
for freshness in 'Void'

By GEOFF MARINO
Daily Arts Writer
So you're making a new friend
at a party. An awkward pause
ensues, and all you hear is music
pounding.
Partly to break
the "silence"
and partly to Dr. Dog

this person, you
ask - "what is
your favorite band?" The answer:
the Beatles. On the outside, you
nod approvingly. On the inside,
you think about how to leave the

Sound familiar? You probably
live in the year 2012. Music has
become so varied and so much
creativity bursts from countless
blogs that you have long grown
bored of '60s pop. You envy swag,
and no longer want Paul McCart-
ney's hair.
Dr. Dog has long been derided
as a lonely bit of '60s nostalgia
floating in an ocean of 21st cen-
tury musical innovations. Its
embrace of '60s pop and even the
to-fi sound were considered too
referential to the past, and not
innovative enough to be given
heaps of praise. However, Be The
Void, the band's latest release,
doesn't give anyone opportunity
to make such criticisms. How
does it do so? Through its embrace
of a more fast-paced, indie rock.
'The first two songs, "Lone-
some" and "That Old Black Hole,"
signal the band's progression.

Like the best evolutions, it incor-
porates tradition with innova-
tion. "Lonesome" feels a lot like
something off of Dr. Dog's second
album, Easy Beat. It's "chill" -
slow-paced to a point where it just
touches on lethargy and utilizes
vocal harmonies. But it's only a
prelude to something much more
bombastic.

For the Daily
There is an expectation that
The Fray has set for its listeners.
Whether its goal is to be a top-
40 band or not,
that's what the
group is. Pre-
viously, The
Fray released The Fray
albums with Scars & Stories
at least two or
three hits per Epic
record, with
the remaining
tracks containing powerful pia-
no-rock music.
And by the time a rock group
gets to its third studio album,
its true test is whether it can
withstand the difficulty of cre-
ating new and interesting mate-
rial, especially almost seven years
later, as in the case of Scars Et Sto-
ries. The downside to the group
writing all of its own material -
and this applies for many music
groups in general - is that it has
to endure the critiques of many
listeners about how the material
is either too similar or too differ-
ent.
Unfortunately, Scars ft Stories
is lacking. The promotional sin-
gle "Heartbeat" didn't perform
nearly as well as the lead singles
for its other albums, and with that
song having the most mainstream
sound to it, this doesn't bode well
for the success of other singles on
the album. The beginning of the
song's chorus also has a brief but
uncanny resemblance to the cho-
rus of Coldplay's "Every Teardrop
Is a Waterfall."
Ignoring the album's poten-
tial commercial success, it still
misses its target among fans of all
of The Fray's work. Isaac Slade's
voice is perfectly suited for a tone
of sadness and desperation, so it
complements the group's heav-
ily emotional music. And while

beyond the authority of the com-
mittee. He added thathe thought
the advisory committee was not
functioning as well it should.
"The rules are in a pretty bad
state, and I've been working to
redraft them," Friedman said.
Committee members also
considered a resolution that

would further advise the Uni-
versity on the investigation.
SACUA member John Lehman,
a professor of ecology and evo-
lutionary biology, called for an
external investigation of the
case.
"We (should) ask the admin-
istration to engage in an inde-
pendent outside investigation
and make those results public,"
he said. .
Other committee members
said they agreed with the pro-
posal, but believed SACUA
should wait until the inter-
nal investigation is complete,
including Medical School Prof.

Charlie Koopmann.
"If there appears to be signifi-
cant felonious or criminal activ-
ity, it should be expected to turn
over to outside authorities who
would be impartial."

Roger Cohen visits.
as part of 'Israel
'Today' symposium,
By CHELSEA LANDRY
Daily StaffReporter
Though students often hear.
about the Arab-Israeli conflict
from their peers and professors,
yesterday they had the opportu-
nity to hear from a columnist at
the nation's newspaper of record.
Several hundred people
packed the Rogel Ballroom in
the Michigan Union last night to
listen to a lecture by New York
Times columnist Roger Cohen.
Cohen's talk was a part of the
Center of Judaic Studies'two-day
"Israel Today" symposium and
focused on three major themes -
the role of Iran in Israel, Israel's
reaction to the Arab Spring and
internal Israeli tension due to
escalating tensions in the region.
Cohen began by discussing
his own heritage as a Lithuanian
Jew, a population nearly elimi-
nated during the Holocaust. In
his speech, he argued that the
Arab-Israeli conflict involves all
humans, regardless of faith, and
has perpetuated violence and
death over a slew of issues since
its onset.
"Out of this conflict has been
radicalism, violence (and) repeat-
ed wars, and there's no question

that the world would be a differ-
ent place if it were solved," Cohen
said.
Cohen said the Holocaust
shaped his view of the conflict
and influenced his preference for
a two-state solution. -
"We the Jews, who have been
through enough oppression (and)
humiliation in our history to
know that we as Jews do not want
to inflict that on another people,"
he said.
BothIsraeland thePalestinians
have, at different times, attempted
toportraytheirstates asvictimsof
the other, Cohen said. He dubbed
the issue "Victim Olympics," and
noted its lack of productivity in
solvingthe problem.
Though discord between the
two combatants has occurred for
almost a century, Cohen told the
audience that college students
can play a significant role in the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
"The more creative energy
young people can applythere, the
better," he said.
Cohen said the actions of Israel
and the United States in deal-
ing with Iran will have a lasting
effect on the region, also noting
that being a proponent of Israel
can also mean "being a critical
friend" of the country.
"I can assure you one thing,"
he said. "If Israel and the United
States were to bomb Iran, a move
which I oppose passionately ...

that one day in 2012 thatthe West
bombed Iran," he said.
Despite all of the current tur-
moil, Cohen said he ultimately
remains hopeful for a peaceful
solution.
"I'm not a complete pessimist,"
he said. "I do believe extraordi-
nary things can happen."
Organizations like J Street -
a pro-Israel organization that
advocates for collaboration in
developing policy that establish-
es a two-state solution - which
Cohen mentioned several times
during the lecture, support his
hope for a two-state solution.
Mandy Kain, an executive
member of J Street Umich, the
University's chapter of the orga-
nization, attended the lecture
and wrote in an e-mail that she
agreed with Cohen's ideas.
"I think Roger Cohen's talk did
a fantastic job of demonstrating
that you can be an avid supporter
of Israel, can treasure its peace
and security and still advocate for
a Palestinian state," Kain wrote.
She added that she believes
effective policy that advocates
for peace can be attained through
increased collaboration and dis-
cussion among opposing groups.
"I think the future of Israel
can be a very bright one if people
let go of the old, divisive rhetoric
of 'Pro Israel' vs. 'Pro Palestine'
and embrace dialogue and a two-
state solution," Kain wrote.
mitted and hopes the judge will
fully consider the information
presented.
Though he could not reveal
whether or not he will testify,
Raiman said information about
who will present material in front
of the judge will be made public
on Feb. 9.
Raiman added that regardless
of what MERC decides in March,
his group will continue to fight
against unionization.
"If MERC comes up with a
decision that's unfavorable to
us we definitely plan to appeal,"
Raiman said. " ... We do strongly
believe that we are students not
employees, and we'll ... pursue
whatever legal avenues."
Raiman said if MERC decides
to allow a vote for unionization,
his'group's options to appeal lie
with state appeals courts rather
than MERC.
"I think there will be some
interest within the judicial system
in our case, so we're prepared to
go that route," he said.


UNIONIZATION

ing the commissioners will have
the opportunity to decide for
themselves the fate of the GSRAs'
effort.
GRO President Sam Montgom-
ery, a Rackham graduate student,
wrote in an e-mail that she was
content with the hearing.
"GSRAs have testified aboutthe
work that they do," Montgomery
wrote. "We are confident that the
judge will review the facts fairly."
. Stephen Raiman, founder of
Students Against GSRA Unioniza-
tion and a Rackham graduate stu-
dent, said he was not impressed by
GEO'sperformance atthehearing.
"I think the case that was made
by the union attorney was very
weak," Raiman said. "I think that
a lot of their supporting evidence
and testimony was not compel-
ling to me. It seemed to be a lot of
semantics. "
The dispute at hand is tech-

nically between the University
and GEO, but in May, the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents voted 6-2
fo classify GSRAs as employees,
meaning the official University
position was in favor of calling
GSRAs public employees. Still,
Mary Sue Coleman and other
University officials publicly said
they oppose unionization despite
the regents' support. Outside
parties, such as SAGU and Attor-
ney General Bill Schuette, were
not allowed to participate in the
hearing and have said that they
consider the decision unfair given
that the University and GEO do
not actually disagree.
In the official hearing, SAGU
and Schuette could not present
facts or cross-examine witnesses.
However, time has been set aside
during the week of Feb. 20 for
those opposed to unionization to
present facts and possibly testify
before the administrative judge.
Raiman said he was pleasantly
surprised by the decision to allow
