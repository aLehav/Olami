An allegation of rape crumbled 

the facade surrounding University 
of Michigan professor David Daniels 
this summer, dubbed by many as one 
of the best countertenors in the world. 
The assault, however, is not Daniels’ 
only instance of predatory sexual 
behavior. 
Through 
police 
reports 

filed with Pittsfield Township, The 
Michigan Daily found the Office of 
Institutional Equity knew about an 
instance of Daniels’s questionable 
behavior as early as March 2018 — and 
the University still awarded him with 
tenure in May. 

Daniels 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 

recognizable figures in international 
opera, and made waves when he 
joined the faculty at the School of 
Music, Theater & Dance in 2015. 
In August, the music world buzzed 
about an allegation of rape made by 
baritone singer Samuel Schultz, who 
said Daniels and his husband, Scott 
Walters, raped him at a Houston opera 
festival in 2010.

Daniels made tenure on May 17 

with approval from Melody Racine, 
former SMTD interim dean. Nowhere 
in Daniels’s tenure review are the 
March reports of sexual misconduct 
mentioned.

Furthermore, the Department of 

Public Safety and Security knew about 
Schultz’s allegation July 18, and on July 
19, they learned from Music, Theatre & 
Dance senior Samuel Kidd that he had 
been solicited on Grindr by Daniels. 
Daniels faced no public admonition or 
repercussions until late August when 
he was put on leave.

This information was confirmed 

through 
interviews 
with 
sources 

and a document acquired by The 
Daily earlier this year through the 
Freedom of Information Act. The 
document is a Pittsfield Township 
Police Department record concerning 

a Grindr solicitation allegation Kidd 
made against Daniels. This record was 
transferred to Pittsfield from DPSS 
and contains information on all prior 
DPSS investigations into Daniels.

The Daily also requested information 

on investigations on Daniels from both 
DPSS and OIE, but both FOIA requests 
were denied because of University 
policy that prevent the offices from 
disclosing records that may interfere 
with ongoing investigations.

Allegations 
against 
Daniels 

are continuing to pile up. Just 
last Wednesday, Music, Theatre & 
Dance 
graduate 
student 
Andrew 

Lipian filed a lawsuit claiming he 
was assaulted by Daniels in March 
2017. Lipian accused the University 
of knowing about Daniels’s abuse of 
students and failing to do anything 
about it. The suit alleges that in August, 
a faculty member became aware of 
Lipian being sexually assaulted by 
Daniels and reported it to OIE. As 
of yet, Lipian says he has not been 
contacted by the office.

When The Daily reached out 

to University Public Affairs for a 
statement after Schultz’s story broke 
in August, Associate Director Kim 
Broekhuizen affirmed the University’s 
commitment to investigating every 
report seriously and carefully, and its 
belief in maintaining an environment 
free of sexual misconduct.

“At the University of Michigan, 

every report we receive, in whatever 
form, is taken seriously and is carefully 
reviewed for appropriate action,” 
Broekhuizen wrote in a statement. 
“We believe that no one should 
ever be subjected to discriminatory 
harassment or sexual misconduct. We 
are deeply committed to the creation 
and support of a safe and productive 
learning environment for all our 
students, faculty and staff.”

After obtaining the Pittsfield record 

and talking with sources, The Daily 
has found that, at least in Daniels’s 
case, the University has neglected to 

According to a survey of 

435 
University 
of 
Michigan 

undergraduate 
students 

conducted by The Daily, 92 
percent of survey respondents 
registered to vote in Michigan 
plan to vote in the gubernatorial 
election on Tuesday. Among 
students who intend to vote, 69 
percent plan to vote for Gretchen 
Whitmer, 14 percent plan to vote 
for Bill Schuette, 15 percent are 
unsure and 1 percent plan to vote 
for another candidate.

According to Tufts University’s 

National Study of Learning, 
Voting, 
and 
Engagement 

2017 Campus Report, only 14.3 
percent of eligible University 
of Michigan students voted in 
the 2014 midterm election, as 
compared with 18.1 percent of 
students from all institutions 
nationwide. 
Political 
Science 

professor 
Nicholas 
Valentino 

studies political campaigns and 
is currently teaching a class 
about mass media and political 
behavior. Given generally low 

student voter turnout rates, 
Valentino doubts a 92 percent 
student 
voter 
participation 

rate is feasible. However, given 
the 
increased 
mobility 
and 

emotional energy preceding this 
midterm election, he said he 
would not be surprised if student 
voting participation increased 
significantly.

“This is a very emotionally 

intense 
election 
compared 

to 
most 
off-year 
elections,” 

Valentino said. “It’s much more 
salient and it’s much more 
emotionally energized, and in 
particular the energy is coming 
from this emotion of anger and 
outrage.”

Though 
many 
students 

express interest in voting, the 
barriers they face can explain 
a drop-off in their turnout 
rates. Campus organizers, like 
Public Policy junior Katie Kelly, 
communications director of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, have been mobilizing 
the past several months to tackle 
these obstacles.

Three professors and political 

science professionals discussed 
what they felt was required in 
order to be informed ahead of 
midterm elections on Tuesday 
at 
a 
roundtable 
discussion 

Thursday at the University of 
Michigan Institute for Social 
Research. 

A 
host 
of 
programming 

and 
institutional 
initiatives 

this 
semester 
have 
focused 

on increasing awareness and 
turnout 
in 
the 
upcoming 

elections. Only 14 percent of 
students voted in the 2016 
election. This summer, however, 
Washtenaw County as a whole 
experienced the highest surge in 
voter turnout across the state 
for the primary, jumping by 6.7 
percent. 

Four 
individuals 
robbed 

a Boober bicycle taxi driver 
early Thursday morning on the 
University of Michigan campus, 
according to a crime alert sent 
out to students. 

The Division of Public Safety 

and Security reported the armed 
robbery took place on the Diag 
near West Hall, close to the 
intersection of South University 
Avenue 
and 
East

sexual 

misconduct.

***
David 
Daniels 
joined 
the 

Music, Theatre & Dance School 
faculty in 2015. One of the 
University’s most famous alumni, 
he enjoyed a quick rise to fame 
after graduating with a master’s 
degree from the vocal program 
in 1992, making his Metropolitan 
Opera Debut only five years after 
graduation. Daniels was well 
known in the opera sphere as the 
“world’s leading countertenor.” 
He’s so famous that Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg officiated his 
wedding to Walters.

Daniels’s reputation has largely 

benefitted the University — it’s 
attracted 
several 
prospective 

students. Student 1, a student 
in the voice department who 
requested to remain anonymous 
due to privacy concerns, recalled 
when she auditioned for the 
program and the excitement 
surrounding Daniels joining the 

faculty.

“There 
were 
a 
lot 
of 

countertenors 
there 
(saying), 

‘Omg I just can’t wait to see if I 
can study with Daniels! I hope 
he’s in my audition room!’” 
Student 1 said.

Student 2, another student 

in the voice department who 
requested 
anonymity, 
was 

Daniels’ student. He said part 
of why chose the University was 
because he felt he meshed well 
with Daniels, and he knew he was 
a huge deal in the opera world.

SMTD Faculty Member 1, 

who also requested anonymity, 
expressed the strong sense of 
pride among the Music, Theatre 
& Dance School community that 
such a famous alum came back to 
teach at the school.

“We had such high hopes for 

him,” Faculty Member 1 said. 
“Everybody was so proud that he 
was on the faculty.”

Student 2 said part of why he 

was drawn to study with Daniels 
is because of his friendly, bubbly 
personality. Student 1 agreed and 
said her interactions with Daniels 
were nothing but positive. 

“Daniels was very openly 

friendly,” 
Student 
1 
said. 

“Cracking jokes, always had a 
huge smile on his face … (if asked) 
who was the most positive energy 
source in the program, I would 
probably say him as a professor.”

And yet, these faculty members 

and students agreed Daniels’s 
humor was often overtly sexual. 
Lipian’s lawyer Deborah Gordon 
writes in the lawsuit that she 
spoke with a faculty member who 
noted Daniels’s overtly sexual 
humor. Faculty Member 1 echoed 
this sentiment.

“It’s one of those ‘in retrospect’ 

things,” Faculty Member 1 said. 
“He would make jokes that I 
wouldn’t have been comfortable 
making.” 

Student 2 described how in his 

lessons, Daniels’s humor became 
increasingly sexual over the 
years.

“In 
lessons, 
he 
would 

pretty often talk about sexual 
things, which made me very 
uncomfortable,” Student 2 said. 
“I never expressed to him my 
sexuality at all but sometimes he 
would make assumptions about 
my sexuality and make comments 
as if I would laugh about certain 

things that might be popular 
in gay culture, in gay sexual 
cultures.”

This same student noted on 

several occasions, Daniels made 
sexual 
comments 
regarding 

other students.

“I 
remember 
times 

specifically, it was after one of 
my performances, (Daniels said) 
‘Who was that boy who played X 
role? How old is he?’” Student 
1 
said. 
“(He 
was) 
making 

comments about how attractive 
the person is. I don’t know, it just 
made me sort of uncomfortable 
that he was talking like that in 
front of me.”

Looking back, these students 

and faculty said it isn’t hard to 
imagine, then, that this kind of 
behavior was a hint at something 
more insidious.

***
Student 3, who requested 

anonymity due to privacy and 
safety concerns, said he was 
messaged on Grindr—a dating 
app geared towards gay and 
bisexual 
men—by 
someone 

with the username #GoBlue 
on March 26, 2018. #GoBlue 

offered him money to come 
over to his house and engage in 
sexual activity. After some initial 
conversation, #GoBlue let him 
know he was a faculty member at 
the University about to get tenure 
in May, and said because of this, 
they would have to be discreet.

The student told #GoBlue he 

thought he was messing around 
with him, and so #GoBlue 
revealed he was David Daniels. 
To confirm this, the student asked 
him to send a picture of himself 
touching his nose in real time.

The student provided The 

Daily with some of the text of this 
Grindr conversation, as well as 
the picture of Daniels touching 
his nose.

Daniels: Looking to make 

a 
hot 
dad/son 
fantasy 
to 

happen!$$$$$$ 
Does 
that 

interest you?

Student: Face? depends if I’m 

into you lol

Daniels: You come to my west 

side hotel , sit back to some porn, 
let daddy suck you off! You leave 
each time with $200 bucks. Very 
discreet here. U ofM affiliated so 
need to private (sic) and discreet 
about this.

The 
student 
was 
very 

distressed by this incident and 
confided in a friend. It was this 
friend who, on March 29, filed a 
report on behalf of the student, 
keeping the student anonymous. 
The student was unsure where 
the report went after that. He 
was not contacted by anyone 
until July, when DPSS detective 
Maureen Burke spoke with him 
over the phone.

In 
the 
Pittsfield 
police 

record, Burke and another DPSS 
detective, 
Margie 
Pillsbury, 

wrote that after they learned 
about 
Schultz’s 
allegations 

against Daniels in July, they 
learned of this student’s March 
allegation—though there was no 
explanation for the delay. Burke 
and Pillsbury contacted OIE 
Senior 
Investigator 
Elizabeth 

Seney and learned the student’s 
campus 
security 
authority 

had been forwarded to OIE to 
investigate the incident.

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
“It’s easy to say that the entire current board and new board 

members are all strong supporters of academic freedom. I think it’s the 
linchpin of any great institution and it’s certainly made this institution 
great I think that academic freedom is the basis of our institution and 
without it, getting any sort of structure of scriptures on something would 
be inappropriate unless it was something harmful being taught.”

Regent Andrea Fischer Newman, running for re-election to the Board of Regents this November

From Page 1A

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, Business sophomore 
Rachel Cunningham covered a vigil on the Diag and a Shemira 
ritual at the Law Quad following the massacre at the Tree of Life 
Congregation synagogue in Pittsburgh, PA.

“I think from the perspective of someone that is not in the Jewish 
community, it was very interesting and insightful to watch the 
community -- both people that are and are not Jewish -- come 
together in a time that’s so horrible for the community. I really felt 
the love and appreciation that the community had for itself and its 
members, even when I’m not one that follows that specific religion. 
It inspires me to work with people more in my stories and learn more 
about viewpoints that aren’t my own.”

Being a schoolgirl is not sexy. 

Trust me, I went to Catholic school 
for a whopping 15 years, from the 
moment I was potty-trained to the 
ring of “Pomp and Circumstance” 
in my ears. Before I came to the 
University, I had only gone to one 
school for my entire life, and barely 
owned clothes for the winter, 
because I had been wearing a 
uniform for at least half of the year 
beforehand. Plaid is in my blood 
at this point. But it’s interesting to 
see how the perception of Catholic 
schooling plays out in the media 
with a firsthand knowledge of 
how it actually is in real life. It’s 
a complicated thing to think 
about — some of the tropes of all-
girls education are true, but gloss 
over the deeper realities of that 
experience. There are very few 
depictions of schoolgirls in movies 
and TV that actually show them 
as they exist, instead sexualizing 
or 
emphasizing 
certain 
traits 

that marr the truth behind those 
characters beyond recognition.

That isn’t to say that we didn’t 

play into it: My first year of college, at 
least 10 of my 28-person graduating 
class went as sexy schoolgirls for 
Halloween. Now, we already had 
the materials — the high school I 
went to was very Catholic, all-girls 
and everyone rolled the bands of 
their skirts to the point that pink 
slips were no longer a punishment 
in their ubiquity. The point of this 
was to be trendy more than sexy, 
and create some control within the 
rigid lines of our dress code. Despite 
this, no one ever dressed up. These 
skirts, however short they were, 
often countered baggy sweatshirts, 
giant wool blazers, messy buns 
and makeupless faces. But I think 
that the difference between media 
portrayals of schoolgirls and their 
real-life counterparts goes beyond 
the length of our skirts or even 
our image itself — we were mostly 
trying to impress each other rather 
than a male voyeur, keeping it 
trendy and on par with our own 
fashion senses, not to explicitly 
reflect a fantasy. The interplay 
between media’s expectations of us 
and our expectations of each other 
was complex, a relationship that 
could either act as a mirror or an 
example of stark contrast.

There were many layers to that 

relationship, as both the media and 
the people around me influenced my 
perception of myself as a schoolgirl. 
The disconnect there was more 
abstract than I realized when it was 
actually happening — while I was 
never the sexy archetype depicted 
in media imagery like Britney 
Spears’s “Baby One More Time” or 
even the conniving, manipulative 
version of schoolgirlery in “Kill 
Bill”’s Gogo Yubari or “Battle 

Royale,” but those aspects of the 
uniformed, flirty images all around 
us infused a sense of self-awareness 
into the way I dressed and acted. I 
would often forget I was in uniform 
until I got weird looks from men 
on the street, and although there 
were several Catholic schools 
in 
my 
conservative, 
largely 

wealthy 
white 
neighborhood, 

that hyper-observation of my 
surroundings continued every time 
I was in public. There was always 
a consciousness in the back of my 
mind about what the people around 
me were thinking: Did they notice 
my skirt? Did they even care?

I have heard stories, specifically 

from friends who live in larger 
cities, that going out into the world 
in uniform is a treacherous thing 
— that the catcalls only escalate, 
that they feel like bait while just 
trying to get to school. “Schoolgirl” 
is a highly-searched term on any 
internet porn website, and that’s 
just the beginning. These portrayals 
of uniformed teenagers are often 
infantilized, but they exist among 
over-adult depictions as well. The 
girls that I spent every day with 
weren’t anything like the extreme 
versions of themselves shown in 
hyper-sexualized 
imagery, 
but 

they also weren’t like Blair Waldorf 
and Serena van der Woodsen of 

“Gossip Girl” legend. We didn’t go 
out clubbing every weekend, didn’t 
have wild trysts with teachers 
or administrators, didn’t sit on 
the steps of local museums and 
certainly couldn’t do the kinds of 
things they did with their uniforms. 
The schoolgirls shown in media 
like “Gossip Girl” weren’t girls; 
they were women. And I certainly 
wasn’t a woman when I wore that 
skirt, and neither were most of my 
friends and classmates.

However, 
as 
realism 
seeps 

into the media and more female 
directors take their first steps with 
fantastic films and TV shows, 
these stereotypical images of life 
in uniform are softening, taking 
more realistic shape in movies 
like Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird.” 
When I saw the trailer for that film 
initially, I was slightly skeptical 
— would she do that experience 
justice? Would Gerwig be able to 
capture the awkwardness, the 
laughter, the tears and the intense 
female bonding that an all-girls 
school can foster? I finally saw 
the movie, and was sobbing by the 
end. It was the first time that my 
thoughts and feelings around life as 
a schoolgirl were actually realized 
on screen, without a sexual or 
violent edge like I had seen in other 
media before. Everything, from 
the gross sweatshirts to the shitty 
theatre department with a brother 
school, to the sadness that comes 
from a male-teacher crush in a 
world full of women, was accurate 
and piercingly honest to the pure 
awkwardness and reality of what 
being a schoolgirl really means.

We need more media like “Lady 

Bird,” because I loved my life in 
plaid, and it wasn’t sexy; it was just 
fun and supportive, a community 
that I could fall back into when the 
going got tough. So the next time 
you see the flash of a plaid skirt on 
the street, don’t think of Britney 
Spears. Think of friendship, of 
laughter in hallways and the slam 
of lockers as school lets out. When I 
see my younger sister in uniform, it 
makes me smile. Being a schoolgirl 
is much more than what we look 
like — it’s a way to equalize, to learn 
under the same umbrella of terrible 
fashion during the best and worst 
years of our lives. Don’t turn it into 
a whistle on the street.

G-Men combine spectacles 
of talent for annual G-Fest

A group of best friends, 

heartthrobs 
and 
talented 

singers, the Michigan G-Men 
are ready to let loose and have 
fun this Friday at their annual 
variety show “G-Fest.” The 
premier all-male a cappella 
group 
will 
be 
performing 

alongside 
other 
University 

performance groups including 
Revolution 
(a 
performance 

collective 
specializing 
in 

Chinese 
Yo-yo, 
Photonix, 

glowstick visual artists) and 
Midnight Book Club (an improv 
comedy troupe). 

The G-Men have been on 

campus for 24 years, and their 
hard work has continued to 
impress audiences. The group 
commits to participating in 
philanthropic 
events 
and 

a concert tour around the 
country. Rehearsing for seven 
hours a week, the G-Men 
are dedicated to mastering 
their collaborative talent and 
eclectic sound, carrying with 
them an array of voice parts 
and personalities. Their sets 
usually 
consist 
of 
ranging 

music genres from modern pop 
to experimental rock and more. 
Two of their untraditional 
but popular hits are “Eleanor 
Rigby” and “Skinny Love.”

During their travels, the 

guys have been able to share 
their talent as well as meet 
other students with similar 
interests and experiences. “We 
travel a lot and are asked to 
perform at competitions and 

shows,” said LSA Senior Daniel 
Honet. “You get to connect 
and meet all these incredible 
people that you wouldn’t get to 
know otherwise,” which also 
reflects the embodiment of 
G-Fest. 

Their effort in creating a 

stimulating and entertaining 
performance represents the 
G-Men members. Many of the 
guys are not SMTD majors, 
but are involved in all types of 
fields and still commit time to 

singing and working with the 
group. 

“The G-Men is where I can 

relieve all the stress that I get 
from academics and stuff like 
that,” said G-Men President 
and LSA Junior Kyle Kim. 
“We’re always having a lot of 
fun.” 

Although 
the 
group 
is 

used to performing within a 
musical, a cappella setting, 
G-Fest shows its uniqueness 
by bringing together various 
artistic mediums. The concert 
showcases a “specific niche of 
Michigan culture, so it’s nice 
to see them coming together 
… spectacles of all kinds,” said 

LSA Senior Jake Wilson. 

Designing 
a 
mosaic 
of 

flavors and artists, G-Fest is 
an event made for anybody to 
enjoy. “G-Fest is always just a 
really enthralling performance 
for the people who are in the 
audience because it brings 
something for anyone of all 
ages,” Wilson added. The event 
is hosted on parents’ weekend 
every 
year, 
so 
they 
can 

“come and see which student 
performing 
groups 
are 
on 

campus and what this campus 
has to offer.”

Whether that be parents, 

students 
or 
community 

members, the audience feeds 
off the performers’ energy. 
Kim, 
Wilson 
and 
Honet 

emphasized the notion that 
when showing up with smiles 
on their faces, being goofy and 
radiating how much fun they’re 
having, the audience can’t 
help but to party alongside 
them. “The audience is so 
supportive,” Honet added. “The 
crowd is constantly supporting 
anything happening on stage, 
even if someone messes up.” 
It’s evident that this is a 
notable trait of the G-Men and 
their familial bond.

“My favorite part about the 

G-Men is just having a support 
network,” Wilson said. “U of 
M is a big place, so it’s nice to 
have a group of people that 
you know are going to be there 
for you week-in and week-out, 
both in person and in spirit.”

Excited to highlight their 

work and the talents of other 
artistic collectives, the G-Men 
present “G-Fest 2018” this 
Friday at Rackham Auditorium.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

“G-Fest 
2018”

Nov. 2, 2018 @ 

8:00 p.m.

Rackham 
Auditorium

Students $7, 
General $12

The enthusiasm was nearly 

as tangible as the rain as 
students 
crowded 
into 
the 

Hill Auditorium with their 
umbrellas 
Saturday 
night. 

Despite the Halloween scene 
and festivities, there was no 
denying the ardent presence 
of the concert (soon to be 
party) 
goers 
donning 
their 

costumes for the A R I Z O N A 
concert hosted by Big Ticket 
Productions. The excitement 
for the opening acts were as 
high — T-shirts and posters 
bearing “Mikky Ekko” and 
“Electric Guest” were seen 
throughout the crowd. By the 
looks of it, the concert was set 
to be an absolute spectacle for 
fans who’ve been waiting for 
the recognition of these up and 
coming musicians.

I’ll admit it: I couldn’t quite 

grasp it at first. I came because 
of a friend’s recommendation, 
a tabula rasa and a skeptic to 
the alternative rock genre 
 that 

prevails 
oversaturated 
and 

derivative across Spotify. I 
couldn’t bring myself to listen 
to a single track before the 
show. Nonetheless, I kept an 

open mind and curiosity for the 
acts of the night and the type 
of energy they’d exude; could it 
compare to the passions of their 
fans?

I tentatively sat between my 

just-as-clueless friend and a 
girl who screamed ecstatically 
when the lights dimmed to 
the entrance of Mikky Ekko. 
As someone whose experience 
with opening acts is a general 
disinterest, I was wonderstruck 
by the charisma and force 
Mikky Ekko delivered. His 
thunderous, synth-heavy vibe 
was immersive and emotion-
packed, albeit a bit chaotic; it 
felt as though it came in waves 
of 
percussions 
and 
dense, 

poetic lyricism. It paired well 
alongside 
his 
spazzed 
out 

dancing that carried to the 
beat like an exorcism. He didn’t 
just move to the beat, the beat 
moved him. His voice was calm 
and melodic, adding a balanced 
undertone to the performance. 
Ekko’s 
closing 
rendition 
of 

“Stay” by Rihanna showcased 
how multifaceted his vocals are 
as he shifted to a rawer tone 
gainst the sparse instrumentals: 
melancholic and delicate. His 
moves were just as present and 
emotive, as he closed his eyes 
and swayed to the beat.

Following 
Mikky 
Ekko 

was 
Electric 
Guest. 
When 

the lead singer stormed onto 
the stage with a plastic mask 
and animated dance moves, 
my friend turned to me and 
said: “How is he not lip-
syncing?” 
His 
falsetto 
was 

perfect, 
energy 
contagious 

and his moves, though not as 
grand as Ekko’s, were deft 
and smooth. The lead singer 
could swing from low to high 
register with ease and overall 
proved a stunning performer. 
Though blithe and laidback, 
their sound had a light, almost 
nostalgic energy to it with its 
sunny 
instrumentation 
and 

varied vocals. The band had a 
cool, LA-esque element to their 
music that I’m usually quick to 
dismiss, but their swagger and 
charm was contagious. The 
band’s penultimate song of the 
night “Oh Devil” now holds a 
prominent place in my most 
recent playlist.

It was roughly two hours 

into the show by the time A- 
R I Z O N A finally made an 
appearance. 
Despite 
their 

labeling as the headlining act, 
their performance lasted only 
the final hour of the show. At 
that point, the crowd notably 
whittled down then flourished, 
as fans of the opening acts 
departed and those of the 

DIANA YASSIN

For the Daily

main act packed themselves in. 
Despite A R I Z O N A’s sound 
having elements from those of 
the opening acts, their entrance 
was on a different plane. It was 
a lot less energetic, more well-
paced, upbeat and, dare I say, 
more conventional — it wasn’t 
so much that I was unimpressed 
but that their music felt a lot 
more traditionally pop. That 
being said, their performance 
was far from lackluster as the 
band could handle songs from 
all across the board, from 
dance jams to slower, more 
poignant serenades. I will say, 
I really preferred their slow 
songs and the way they flowed 
to their dreamy aura.

A R I Z O N A’s aesthetic 

is everything you’d expect 
from 
a 
contemporary 

band 
experimenting 
with 

’80s 
synth: 
a 
bit 
angsty, 

a 
bit 
minimalistic, 
but 

very 
ambitious. 
There 

were 
snippets of lyricism 

and 
emotion 
that 
were 

profound and translated well 
through 
the 
lead 
singer’s 

higher vocals. There were 
points 
where 
the 
synth 

felt flat and instrumentals 
underdeveloped, not unlike 
an incessant metronome — the 
saving grace of variety for this 
band was their skillful guitar 
player 
and 
his 
occasional 

solos. The singer’s vocals were 
also versatile for the types of 
songs the band played: He was 
a skillful live singer even when 
dancing. And the band has a 
certain magic on stage; you 
can tell they’re comfortable 
and in the zone, even when 
they do share a laugh or two 
or give one member a special, 
momentary spotlight (even if 
he didn’t want to speak; major 
props to the lead singer). 
Overall, it was a wholesome 
display of togetherness many 
more illustrious bands fail to 
capture in their performances. 

Packed 
between 
songs 

were 
mini 
motivational 

speeches based on the band’s 
tribulations, lasting the length 

of a song. Though admittedly 
trite at times, the lead singer 
spoke to the experience of 
college students struggling to 
find their place in the world. 
This also went on to showcase 
a willingness to connect with 
the audience beyond inviting 
them on stage and reaching 
out for their hands during 
performances, as his remarks 
were based on questions he’d 
ask the audience to raise their 

hand to.

Despite having a similar 

genre and musical elements, the 
three acts had their own distinct 
glimmer throughout the show. 
Big Ticket Productions did a 
fantastic job of organizing a 
concert that allowed for each 
artist to showcase their music 
and unique presence. I can 
definitely say that by the end of 
the night, I would call myself a 
fan of each performer. 

CONCERT REVIEW


N

ext Tuesday, Michigan 
will 
vote 
on 
a 
proposal to legalize 
recreational 
marijuana. 
Between 
increased 
tax 
revenue, the birth of a new 
industry in the private sector 
and 
falling 
arrest 
rates, 
legalization of marijuana in 
Michigan would be extremely 
lucrative to the statewide 
economy. 
Michigan 
is 
currently one of 30 states 
that allows marijuana use 
for medical purposes, but a 
“yes” vote on Proposal 1 this 
November 
would 
legalize 
recreational use, while a 
“no” vote would continue to 
only allow medical access 
to 
marijuana. 
Michigan 
joins four other states who 
have the hot-button issue of 
marijuana legalization on the 
ballot this year, while nine 
states across the country 
have already taken initiative 
in legalizing. Despite a long 
historical 
taboo 
against 
marijuana, obvious economic 
benefits have spurred a wave 
of 
nationwide 
acceptance 
and 
encouragement 
of 
legalization. 
We, 
the 
Michigan 
Daily 
Editorial 
Board, 
encourage 
our 
readership to vote “yes” on 
Proposal 1 for legalization of 
recreational marijuana use.
To be clear, Proposal 1 
would legalize recreational 
marijuana 
use 
for 
those 
21 and older and personal 
possession 
would 
be 
limited to 2.5 ounces, while 
households are allowed to 
store up to 10 ounces and 12 
plants. The measure would 
create an excise sales tax of 
10 percent on all marijuana 
sales at retailers, and that tax 
revenue would be allocated 
to local government, K-12 
education 
and 
statewide 
repairs to roads and bridges. 
The proposal also legalizes 
the cultivation, processing, 
distribution 
and 
sale 
of 
industrial hemp. However, 

if passed, local communities 
would be able to ban or limit 
marijuana retailers within 
their municipal boundaries, 
thereby 
protecting 
the 
autonomy 
of 
local 
communities.
With a 10 percent sales 
tax, legalization would bring 
a much needed new stream 
of revenue into Michigan 
schools, 
roads, 
bridges 
and 
local 
governments. 
States like Washington and 
Colorado bring in millions 
of dollars per year off of tax 
revenue and it is estimated 
that 
marijuana 
taxation 
alone in Michigan will rake 
in $100 to $200 million per 
year to be allocated across 
the state. In a state with 
crumbling 
infrastructure 
and an infamous public K-12 
education system, it’s evident 
that Michigan should use 
every potential extra funding 
source. In a statewide poll in 
June, 70 percent of Michigan 
citizens agreed that public 
schools are not sufficiently 
funded, a fact that is reflected 
in poor testing performance. 
Michigan is one of only five 
states that showed a decline 
in 
reading 
performance 
scores since 2003. Without 
intervention, it is clear that 
this trend cannot change.
Meanwhile, between 2014 
and 2017, the Transportation 
Asset Management Council 
reported that road conditions 
statewide were declining at 
a faster rate than they could 
be improved, leading to a 
slow deterioration of roads 
statewide. 
Roads, 
bridges 
and water sources are all 
seeing 
similar 
declines 
statewide. 
The 
water 
problems in Flint could have 
been 
solved 
much 
more 
rapidly, or even prevented 
altogether had there been 
more infrastructure funding 
and 
there 
are 
currently 
multiple other water sources 
across the state that need 

attention as well. Though the 
projected tax revenue may 
not be much in comparison 
to 
the 
entire 
statewide 
budget, every dollar counts 
in investment for the future.
The creation of an entirely 
new private sector due to 
marijuana retail will give rise 
to new jobs and businesses. 
In 2015, the legal marijuana 
industry in Colorado created 
roughly 
18,000 
jobs 
and 
Michigan could see similar, 
or even greater, job creation 
given 
Michigan’s 
larger 
population in comparison to 
Colorado.
Though 
this 
initiative 
in Michigan could lead to 
similar 
economic 
benefits 
as other states who have 
legalized 
recreational 
marijuana, 
Proposal 
1 
does not fully address the 
past 
criminalization 
of 
marijuana. 
Though 
many 
may benefit in the future, 
legalization does not address 
decriminalization. 
Those 
who have been arrested for 
marijuana use in the past 
would still be incarcerated or 
have illegal marijuana usage 
on their records. Though 
Proposal 1 is a step in the right 
direction toward restorative 
justice, those affected by 
the past criminalization of 
marijuana will still live with 
the consequences even if 
marijuana use is voted into 
legality. Hopefully, Proposal 
1 is just the tip of the iceberg 
in 
helping 
thousands 
to 
expunge 
past 
infractions 
from 
their 
records, 
and 
allow them the capability of 
bettering their own lives and 
thus, the economy. Proposal 
1 is a real, tangible way to 
invest 
in 
the 
education, 
infrastructure 
and 
safety 
of the next generation of 
Michigan citizens, and we at 
the Michigan Daily Editorial 
Board encourage you all to 
get out and vote “yes” on 
Proposal 1.

L

ook at a map of the 
political 
districts 
in 
Michigan 
and 
you’ll find some irregular 
shapes, such as the skinny, 
corkscrew-shaped 
Fourth 
state Senate District or the 
76th state House District, 
which wraps around Grand 
Rapids. Gerrymandering in 
Michigan has been cited as 
being be among the nation’s 
worst, but this year voters 
have a chance to voice 
their opinions on the issue. 
Proposal 2, an initiative 
from the group “Voters not 
Politicians,” would amend 
the Michigan Constitution 
to establish an independent 
commission 
of 
citizens 
responsible for redrawing 
district lines, if adopted.
The 
proposed 
redistricting 
commission 
would consist of 13 citizens 
— 
four 
Republican-
affiliated, four Democratic-
affiliated 
and 
five 
Independent — chosen by 
the Secretary of State from 
completed applications. To 
apply, citizens must meet 
a few guidelines, including 
the stipulation that they 
not have run for nor held 
a local, state or national 
office in the last six years or 
have family that have done 
so. The commission, with 
oversight by the Secretary 
of State, will meet every 10 
years to decide how political 
districts should be drawn. 
While the Secretary of State 
is partisan, the politically-
balanced commission can 
only 
improve 
Michigan’s 
severe 
gerrymandering 
problem. 
Currently, 
the 
party in power has the right 
to redistrict the state and 
often does so in a way that 
benefits its own party — a 

clear conflict of interest 
given 
that 
the 
district 
lines 
could 
determine 
a politician’s success at 
reelection. Proposal 2 is a 
step in the right direction 
to win the value of the vote 
back to the citizens from 
the politicians.
A handful of other states 
have adopted a version of the 
redistricting 
commission 
outlined in Proposal 2, the 
closest being California’s 
independent, non-partisan 
commission 
that 
has 
had variable success. In 
addition, 
Arizona 
also 
employs 
an 
independent 
redistricting 
committee 
that has been successful 
in drawing fairer political 
state maps. Whether the 
redistricting 
commission 
works 
in 
Michigan 
or 
not, it cannot cause much 
harm to the dismal state 
of 
Michigan’s 
political 
districts. Something needs 
to change in order to solve 
the 
extreme 
problem 
of 
gerrymandering 
in 
Michigan, and we hope that 
Proposal 2 is the change 
that we need. Therefore, 
The 
Michigan 
Daily 
Editorial Board endorses 
voting “yes” on Proposal 2 
to bring the vote back to the 
voters.
As 
Nov. 
6 
quickly 
approaches, readers should 
also 
be 
cognizant 
of 
Proposal 3 on the Michigan 
ballot, an initiative from 
“Promote 
the 
Vote.” 
If 
adopted, citizens qualified 
to vote in Michigan would 
automatically 
become 
registered to vote “when 
applying for, updating or 
renewing a driver’s license 
or 
state-issued 
personal 
identification card, unless 

the 
person 
declines.” 
They’d 
also 
be 
able 
to 
“simultaneously register to 
vote with proof of residency 
and obtain a ballot during 
the 2-week period prior 
to an election, up to and 
including 
Election 
Day.” 
Furthermore, 
one 
would 
be newly able to obtain an 
absentee 
ballot 
without 
providing 
a 
reason 
and 
to cast a straight-ticket 
vote for all candidates of a 
particular political party 
when voting in a partisan 
general election.
As of 2016, Michigan 
is ranked 41st out of 50 
in 
terms 
of 
electoral 
integrity 
(that 
is, 
“adherence to standards 
of 
appropriate 
conduct 
during 
the 
pre-election 
period, 
the 
campaign, 
polling day and election 
aftermath.”) 
Proposal 
3 
wouldn’t 
implement 
changes radically different 
from those found in other 
states, but it would bring 
Michigan up to par with 
states performing at the 
higher end of the scale. As 
with any ballot initiative, 
there’s 
a 
question 
of 
whether legislation should 
be done through the state 
House of Representatives 
and 
state 
Senate 
or 
immediately enshrined in 
the State Constitution — 
in the case of Proposal 3, 
however, the changes are 
uncontroversial, have been 
successful in other states 
and have the best chance 
of implementation through 
the 
initiative 
process. 
Therefore, The Michigan 
Daily 
Editorial 
Board 
supports Proposal 3 this 
Tuesday.

ELECTION

I

CYMTOOEFS 
(In 
case 
you missed the onslaught 
of emails from Schlissel): 
Next Tuesday, Nov. 6, is 
Election Day! There 
will be federal, state 
and local elections 
with state and local 
propositions on the 
ballot. While you’re 
most likely aware 
of the contentious 
Michigan 
gubernatorial 
race, 
and hopefully who 
is running for U.S. 
Representative 
in 
your district (Debbie 
Dingell if you’re voting in Ann 
Arbor!), ballot propositions will be 
incredibly important this year in 
Michigan.
Marijuana 
legalization, 
gerrymandering and automatic 
voter registration are all on the 
statewide ballot, so make sure to 
do your research and make a plan 
to vote. For voters in Ann Arbor, 
there will also be three citywide 
ballot 
proposals 
regarding 
a 
parking lot, filling vacancies on 
Ann Arbor City Council and park 
maintenance taxes. While these 
seem incredibly dull in comparison 
to weed and gerrymandering, they 
will have an effect on our local 
community and we should pay 
attention.
For now, let’s pay attention 
to Proposal A, or its long-form 
name: “Charter Amendment for 
the City-Owned Public Land 
Bounded by Fifth Avenue, and 
William, Division, and Liberty 
Streets to be Designated, in 
Perpetuity, as an Urban Park and 
Civic Center Commons to be 
Known as the “Center of the City,” 
by Amending the Ann Arbor City 
Charter Adding a New Section 
1.4 to Chapter 1 of the Charter.” 
We’ll just call it Prop A. The 
result of Prop A will be incredibly 
important to affordable housing in 
Ann Arbor.
Prop A is the culmination 

of longstanding contention over 
the fate of the “Library Lot.” The 
Library Lot is the area above the 
underground 
parking 
lot near the Ann 
Arbor Public Library. 
If you can’t visualize 
this block of unused 
space, go get the best 
Mexican food in Ann 
Arbor at Chela’s and 
then walk to your left 
as you’re leaving and 
you’ll see.
According 
to 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Central Park Ballot 
Committee, this is the 
last free public space available for 
a public city center. The Central 
Park Ballot Committee is the 
group responsible for getting 
Prop A on the ballot this year. 
Mayor Christopher Taylor and 
the majority of City Council 
disapprove of the idea to make 
the space into a public urban park 
and have already authorized the 
sale of the space to Chicago-based 
developer Core Spaces for $10 
million to build a high-rise. Then 
two councilmembers sued the 
mayor and city clerk for this 
decision. Ultimately, the Central 
Park Ballot Committee was able to 
come up with enough signatures 
to let voters decide. Thus, Prop A 
was born.
Personally, I am sick of high-
rise construction in Ann Arbor. 
I can’t keep track of 411 vs. Six11 
vs. Hub Ann Arbor vs. The Yard, 
and so on. Why can’t their names 
be more distinct? Why would 
anyone pay more than $1,000 
per month to live on South Main 
Street? I don’t know! Anyway — 
when I first heard of Prop A, I 
was all for a park if it meant one 
fewer of these buildings. And in 
my opinion, I think that’s how 
the committee wants the issue to 
look — as if it is a choice between 
an enhanced community center or 
selling out our city to a corporation. 
That is so far from the whole story, 

though.
The park would cost taxpayers 
millions of dollars, and it would 
mean losing out on the initial 
$10 million from Core Spaces 
and up to $2 million in taxes 
from them each year. This is 
money that has been pledged 
toward worthy causes — money 
that would enhance the Ann 
Arbor community in much more 
substantial ways than another 
urban park. An estimated $5 
million of the revenue from the 
development would go toward 
affordable housing projects in Ann 
Arbor.
Ann Arbor is a city of 
students, 
academics 
and 
families. 
Ann 
Arbor 
is 
an 
incredibly expensive city to live 
in — especially considering the 
proportion of residents who are 
students without a significant 
income. Public parks may or may 
not create community, but there 
is no community of Ann Arbor 
without its people. Continuing 
to force students to commute to 
school from further away than 
their richer peers or to be stuck 
in 
overpriced 
housing 
with 
failing appliances and negligent 
landlords is the true deterioration 
of the Ann Arbor community. 
To invest millions of dollars into 
affordable housing would make 
a dent in the overwhelming 
problem that is affordability in 
this city.
Vote “NO” on Proposal A 
Tuesday. Public parks are nice — 
that’s why the Chicago developer 
has pledged to build a public park 
at no cost to the city on the land 
that it will hopefully purchase, 
in addition to a multi-use high-
rise. By voting no, we get that 
park, millions of dollars toward 
affordable housing, education and 
infrastructure, and the only price 
to pay is coping with a little more 
construction.

T

he 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Board 
of 
Regents, a group of 
eight state-elected members who 
have general supervision of the 
University and its endowment, 
has two seats up for election this 
Tuesday. Incumbent candidates 
Regent Andrea Fischer Newman 
(R) and Regent Andrew Richner 
(R) face stiff competition from 
Democratic candidates Jordan 
Acker (D) and Paul Brown (D). 
In the past, The Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board and students 
on campus have often called for 
transparency from the Board of 
Regents, and we are excited to 
see that Acker and Brown both 
pledge ethics and transparency 
if they are elected. Along with 
their concrete plans to increase 
college affordability and the 
fresh perspectives they can bring 
to the board, The Michigan Daily 
Editorial 
Board 
confidently 
endorses Jordan Acker and Paul 
Brown for the open positions on 
the Board of Regents.
Acker stands out as the only 
candidate to have graduated from 
the University in the 21st century, 

yet he still brings significant 
experience to the job. With the 
increasing 
unaffordability 
of 
a University education being a 
major issue for the regents, we 
believe that Acker understands 
the realities of how students 
manage to pay for an education 
in 2018 and will bring a necessary 
perspective to the board. He has 
channeled this perspective into 
advocating specifically for a debt-
free education for all students, 
representing the experience of 
many of his classmates, who 
he said graduated with a debt 
burden unseen in previous 
generations.
As a former White House 
staffer and adviser to the 
Secretary of Homeland Security, 
Janet Napolitano, Acker is well-
versed on making decisions 
that impact the lives of millions. 
We are excited to see much of 
the ingenuity he brings to his 
platform, including a desire 
to broaden the reach of the 
University through extension 
schools throughout the state. 
He also is a strong advocate 
for 
increased 
transparency, 

co-authoring a 10-point plan 
with 
fellow 
Democratic 
candidate Paul Brown calling 
for board meetings to be more 
accessible to the public, rejecting 
campaign donations from those 
with 
business 
relationships 
with the University and other 
transparency reforms.
In addition to his work 
on the 10-point plan, Paul 
Brown also possesses an array 
of 
experience 
that 
makes 
him a superb and qualified 
candidate. As the only union 
member running, we believe 
Brown maintains a unique and 
important perspective that could 
be used as a regent. Brown is a 
proud member of the Lecturers’ 
Employee Organization, a group 
that has been influencing great 
change within our University. 
Brown has also served as a 
collaborator for various public, 
private, not-for-profit, for-profit, 
start-up and public boards. 
Through his positions, he has 
not only gained experience, 
but demonstrated his ability to 
actually provide results. Brown 
has a deep understanding of 
private-public 
financing, 
and under President Obama 
and the U.S. Department 
of Treasury, he helped 
implement the $1.5 billion 
State 
Small 
Business 
Credit Initiative, which has 
helped create more than 
240,000 jobs with no cost to 
taxpayers.
We 
are 
eager 
to 
witness 
Brown 
impart 
similar 
creativity 
and 
diligence in the position 
of regent. Brown’s focus is 
on making the University 
more affordable, but still an 
economic powerhouse. He 
is aware of its profitable and 

influential reach, and plans to 
increase accessibility through 
decreasing tuition rates and 
broadening its economic and 
social impact throughout the 
state. Brown hopes to implement 
a bill similar to Texas, where any 
student graduating in the top 10 
percent of their class is assured 
automatic admission to the 
public universities in their state. 
In addition, he wants to expand 
the 
University’s 
Summer 
Bridge Scholars Program in 
order to increase and maintain 
socioeconomic diversity within 
the University. Finally, he is an 
advocate for educational policy 
change in the state, showing 
his desire to use the position 
as a mechanism for greater 
change. For these reasons and 
his pledge for transparency, 
we endorse Paul Brown for the 
position of regent.
Fischer Newman is one of 
two incumbent regents, and 

she has served on the board 
for more than 20 years — first 
elected in 1994, and re-elected 
in 2002 and 2010. Fischer 
Newman’s experience does 
not fall short in the public 
sector, as she has served as 
the Special Counsel to the 
Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for Acquisition and Logistics 
under President Ronald Reagan 
as well as being appointed to 
the Department of Education’s 
National Advisory Committee 
on Institutional Quality and 
Integrity, among other high-
profile 
positions. 
However, 
Fischer Newman’s experience 
here 
does 
not 
necessarily 
imply 
future 
success 
as 
a 
University 
regent, 
especially in an educational 
climate 
where 
students 
demand affordability and 
transparency.

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Friday, November 2, 2018 
— 5A

Our generation has often been criticized for being vocal about issues yet failing to show up when 

our voices can affect real change — at the polls. There is some truth to the matter, with 18.1 percent of 

college students voting in the 2014 midterm election and University of Michigan students turning out at 

an even lower rate. However, if we do exercise our civil liberty, young people have the power in numbers 

to determine the election. As election day quickly approaches, The Michigan Daily Editorial Board 

encourages students to carefully consider the candidates and issues on the ballot and go out and vote on 

Nov. 6

Here are some things to keep in mind as you head to the polls:

* Polls are open from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Nov. 6.

* There will be buses departing from Ingalls Mall and the Duderstadt Center lawn to take you to your 

polling location.

* Lyft will also be providing free or discounted rides to the polls.

* Bring your ID! Mcards are acceptable forms of ID. If you forget your ID or do not have an acceptable 

photo ID, you can still vote by signing an affidavit.

* If you are in line before the polls close, you have the right to cast a ballot.

* You can bring information — including The Michigan Daily’s endorsements — into the voting booth 

with you.

What to know for Election Day

W

ith term limits keeping 
Gov. Rick Snyder from 
running for a third 
term, the people of Michigan have 
a chance to choose a new direction 
for the state’s top office. Candidates 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 
and 
Bill 
Schuette provide starkly different 
visions for the future of the state. 
Whitmer, a former prosecutor and 
state Senate minority leader has 
committed to “fix the damn roads,” 
while Schuette, the current state 
Attorney General, has channeled 
President Donald Trump with his 
“It’s time to win again” slogan.
The Michigan Daily Editorial 
Board strongly endorses Gretchen 
Whitmer for governor of Michigan. 
Whitmer has proven her dedication 
to the state of Michigan through 
her years of public service in local 
government. During the debate 
over whether to expand Medicaid 
under the Affordable Care Act 
in Michigan, Whitmer worked 
across party lines to advocate 
for increased health insurance 
coverage for thousands of Michigan 
residents. That sense of drive and 
prioritization of Michigan unity 
is what brought us, as an editorial 

board, to conclude that she is the 
best candidate to create change in 
our diverse state.
As students, the issue of college 
affordability is at the forefront 
of our minds when considering 
candidates. 
While 
Schuette’s 
plans 
for 
college 
affordability 
have remained vague, Whitmer 
has proposed to implement the 
Michigan Opportunity Scholarship, 
a program that would allow 
Michigan students to have two 
years of higher education schooling 
completely debt free.
Additionally, as young voters, 
Michigan’s public schools remain in 
our minds. Schuette and Whitmer 
strongly disagree, with Schuette 
supporting charter schools and 
the privatization of education, 
much like Secretary of Education 
Betsy DeVos. Whitmer has come 
out in strong opposition of the 
privatization of education. Whitmer 
plans to improve the consistency of 
school funding and create more 
accountability for public schools. 
We agree with Whitmer that this 
plan is a better option to improve 
education quality, accessibility and 
equality in Michigan.

Whitmer’s also supports an 
increase of the state minimum 
wage to $15 an hour, showing her 
dedication to the working class of 
Michigan and her prioritization of 
the standard of living of everyone 
in Michigan. In stark contrast, 
Schuette’s economic policy focuses 
mainly on cutting taxes and vetoing 
tax increases.
The most important issues 
in this upcoming election are the 
ones that affect the everyday lives 
of all the Michiganders who have 
been neglected under the current 
administration: road infrastructure 
and water availability. Whitmer 
has committed to a comprehensive 
and specific plan to improve road 
conditions 
through 
registration 
fees or gas tax increases. Schuette, 
on the other hand, has not included 
any specificity or detail in his 
plan and doesn’t mention where 
the money for any infrastructure 
improvements will come from, 
though he has firmly stated that 
he will work to improve road 
conditions.
Whitmer has also highlighted 
the importance of clean drinking 
water for all Michiganders, making 

special mention of the topic in her 
infrastructure plan. Schuette’s plan 
includes few implementable policies 
and is sparse on details, especially 
concerning 
from 
a 
candidate 
currently part of the administration 
that enabled the Flint water crisis.
We 
are 
also 
concerned 
about 
Schuette’s 
response 
to 
an endorsement by singer Ted 
Nugent, who has made sexist and 
anti-Semitic 
comments 
in 
the 
past. 
Instead 
of 
distancing 
himself from 
Nugent, 
Schuette 

campaigned 
with 
him 
and 
welcomed 
his 
endorsement. 
Schuette’s ties to Nugent are 
worrying 
when 
considering 
Michigan’s need for politicians who 
are able to appeal to many audiences 
and build communities.
Whitmer, 
however, 
is 
a 
uniter. She’s worked tirelessly to 
expand access to Medicaid for 
Michiganders, and has focused 

her campaign on issues affecting 
every resident: water, roads and 
schools. Given her dedication to 
the Michigan community and 
impressively comprehensive policy 
platform, The Michigan Daily 
Editorial board believes Gretchen 
Whitmer is best suited to lead 
Michigan into the future.

I

n 
the 
upcoming 
midterm 
elections, The Michigan Daily 
is endorsing Debbie Stabenow 
for U.S. Senate and Debbie Dingell 
for U.S. House of Representatives. 
The Debbie duo has been working 
tirelessly to take care of all their 
citizens, from families, to students, 
to immigrants, to workers. The two 
have also worked to protect the 
Michigan economy and what it has 
been founded on: the Great Lakes.
Debbie Stabenow has been 
a 
Democratic 
senator 
since 
2001, graduated from Michigan 
State University and was the 
first Michigan woman senator 
elected. Debbie Stabenow is a 
lifelong Michigan native, and her 
top priorities are creating jobs in 
Michigan by growing a diverse 
economy, banning oil and gas 
drilling in the Great Lakes, and 
taking care of agricultural and rural 
communities. 
Stabenow 
supports 
the 

Development, Relief, and Education 
for Alien Minors Act, the Keep 
Families 
Together 
Act, 
and 
comprehensive immigration reform 
to make sure the federal immigration 
system supports families, workers, 
businesses 
and 
farmers. 
She 
considers health care a human 
right and has been campaigning to 
increase children’s health care 
insurance, such as her Quality 
Care for Moms and Babies 
Act to improve maternity 
and infant care. She strongly 
believes full time jobs should 
provide living wages and 
is working to promote job 
opportunities in skilled trades 
and technical careers. As a native 
Michigander, she recognizes how 
important the Great Lakes are to 
our economy and way of life. She 
is committed to creating clean 
energy jobs and reducing our 
fossil fuel use. She has frequently 
voted for stricter restrictions on 

guns and is pro-choice. Stabenow 
has consistently worked to make 
the voting process, as well as the 
government, as transparent 
as possible.

Debbie 
Dingell, a Democratic representative 
for Michigan’s 12th congressional 
district in the U.S. House, studied 

at Georgetown University, and was 
first elected in 2014. She has many 
similar policy priorities to Stabenow. 
Her top priorities include 
ensuring every 

American 
has 
health 
insurance through her protection 
of the Affordable Care Act, working 
to reduce the cost of medicines, 

strengthening 
the 
economy 
by 
supporting 
manufacturing, 
protecting the environment and 
improving workers’ pensions.
Dingell is a strong advocate for 
immigration reform, announcing 
in a joint statement with Michigan 
Reps. John Conyers Jr., Dan Kildee 
and Brenda Lawrence, that we 
are “a Nation of immigrants,” 
and will support the DREAM 
Act. An environmentalist and 
activist, she relates economic 
advancement to the importance 
of all families having access to 
clean air and water as well as 
affordable housing, and — listen 
up college students — affordable 
higher education. She also believes 
in raising the minimum wage, 
another bonus. She is a huge 
supporter of renewable energy and 
is an opponent of Trump’s decision 
to repeal the Clean Power Plan and 
withdraw from the Paris Accords. 
Like Stabenow, Dingell places great 

emphasis on the importance of the 
Great Lakes in our economy and has 
detailed plans to protect these great 
Michigan assets. She is pro-choice 
and is endorsed by Emily’s List, an 
organization dedicated to helping 
pro-choice candidates run for office. 
She is an advocate for government 
transparency as well and constantly 
works toward making elections free, 
fair and non-discriminatory.
Stabenow and Dingell have 
been taking care of Michiganders 
and Americans for the past few 
years, providing health care, jobs 
and a stable economy to all their 
constituents. Now it is our turn. We 
must take care of our fellow students 
and Michiganders and vote to keep 
Debbie Stabenow and Debbie Dingell 
in office. Students hold a powerful 
role in the upcoming election. We 
have the power to stand up for what 
is right and turn this nation around, 
but only if we vote responsibly. Vote 
for the two Debbies in the midterms.

Jonah Hill’s career has been 

nothing if not dynamic. In 
2007, he broke onto the scene 
with “Superbad,” a high-school 
screwball comedy that’s still 
mentioned as the gold-standard 
for the genre post-2000. Hill’s 
performance as the boisterous, 
awkward and overweight Seth 
would prove both a blessing 
and a curse, launching him to 
stardom but pigeonholing him 
as “The Fat Guy” in Hollywood.

“I became famous in my late 

teens and then spent most of 

my young adult life listening 
to people say that I was fat 
and gross and unattractive,” 
Hill writes in an A24 program 
given to audiences at “Mid90s” 
early screenings. “It’s only in 
the last four years, writing and 
directing my movie “Mid90s,” 
that I’ve started to understand 
how much that hurt and got into 
my head.” 

Clearly, 
“Mid90s” 
was 
a 

watershed moment for Hill, 
a creative expression of self-
discovery both as a child and 
again as a young adult artist. 
This is unequivocally the film’s 
greatest strength; from the 
opening credits to the final shot, 
it’s clear that Hill has poured 

his soul into this piece. The film 
tells the story of Stevie (Sunny 
Suljic, “The Killing of a Sacred 
Deer”), a 13-year-
old who finds an 
escape from his 
turbulent 
home 

life with a group 
of 
high 
school 

skateboarders. 
As the guys grow closer, each 
reveals the unique struggles 
and triumphs of their day-to-
day lives.

While it certainly has some 

engaging character moments, 
“Mid90s” 
works 
best 
as 
a 

film that’s less about any one 
character 
and 
more 
about 

telling the story of an era and 

a niche culture within it. Hill, 
both a hip hop and skating 
fanatic, brings awe-inspiring 

meticulousness 
to the world he 
depicts, 
evoking 

details too small, 
too 
personal 
to 

be anything but 
autobiographical. 

Nevertheless, these moments 
never fall short of relatability, 
and it’s that ability to relate the 
trials and tribulations of a small 
community to the collective 
childhoods 
of 
a 
national 

audience. I’ve never owned a 
skateboard, and I was born in 
the tail end of the ’90s, and yet 
Stevie’s life — his rituals, his 

‘Mid90s’ charms despite hiccups

FILM REVIEW

A24

“Mid90s”

A24

State Theatre

ARTIST PROFILE

enthusiasm, his wide-eyed awe 
at his role models — felt at once 
uncanny and familiar.

This 
ability 
to 
transport 

the viewer is Hill’s crowning 
achievement, and the film is at 
its best when it focuses more 
on this labor-of-love nostalgia 
and less on dramatic tension. 
Unfortunately, the story that 
accompanies this is filled with 
ups and downs. By the film’s 
conclusion, the only character 
arc that feels as if it’s truly been 
completed is the subplot about 
Stevie and his abusive older 
brother Ian (Lucas Hedges, 
“Three 
Billboards 
Outside 

Ebbing, 
Missouri”). 
Na-Kel 

Smith brings some heart to the 
film as Ray, a seemingly aloof 
but kind-hearted cool guy, and 
offers a handful of poignant 
moments as the group’s resident 
philosopher-type. In the end, 
though, the film bites off more 
than it can chew in its scant 
84-minute 
runtime 
and 
at 

least half of its many subplots 
stumble to conclusions that feel 
more like a shrug. 

And we need to talk about 

that scene. If you’ve seen the 
film, you probably know the 
one I’m referring to, but if 
not, be warned: Slight spoilers 
ahead. There’s a sequence about 
halfway through the movie 
where the guys bring Stevie to 
a party. On the bus ride there, 
some of the guys pop adderall 
and Stevie, wanting to fit in, 
does the same. At the party, 
Stevie drinks an entire bottle 
of malt liquor and smokes 
weed with his friends. Now a 
veritable cocktail of substances, 
he’s approached by Estee (Alexa 
Demie, “Brigsby Bear”), a high 
school girl who’s presumably 17 
like the rest of the crew. Their 
conversation turns to flirting 

which turns to Estee leading 
Stevie to a bedroom, and, well, 
let’s just say it doesn’t stop 
there. 

Let’s not mince words — this 

is predatory. Estee is only four 
years older than Stevie, but 
make no mistake: She’s a grown 
woman, and his voice hasn’t 
dropped yet. If that weren’t 
bad enough, he’s so drugged up 
that he can’t possibly consent to 
what is happening. So why does 
the film portray this hookup as 
a victory and then never address 
it again? There’s really no good 
answer, and were gender-roles 
reversed here (an older, sober 
guy hooking up with a wasted 
prepubescent girl) this scene 
would be sparking outrage. It’s 
not inherently wrong to portray 
these types of encounters in 
cinema, but to do so with such a 
brazen “high-five bro!” attitude 
is a head-scratching lapse of 
judgement from a filmmaker 
who 
has 
otherwise 
proven 

himself to be incredibly savvy 
and 
in-touch. 
Unfortunately, 

these thoughts lingered with me 
for the remainder of the film’s 
runtime. 

While far from perfect and, 

at brief moments, concerningly 
ignorant 
in 
its 
messaging, 

“Mid90s” should serve as a 
decent addition to the ever-
growing A24 “coming of age” 
lineup. What it does well it 
does really well, and what it 
does poorly, well, you know. 
Nevertheless, the experience 
remains a net-positive, and 
if nothing else serves as a 
promising beginning for Hill’s 
directing career. Much like the 
era it portrays, “Mid90s” has 
some good times and some not-
so-good times, but ultimately 
carries enough charm and heart 
to be worth it in the end.

The cast of ‘Mid90s’ on 
making it as hooligans

This 
past 
Thursday 

afternoon I had the chance to 
call into a college conference 
call with Sunny Suljic, Olan 
Prenatt, Ryder Mclaughlin and 
Gio Galacia, four of the five 
members of the cast of Jonah 
Hill and A24 Entertainment’s 
latest hit movie “Mid90s.”

Although this was the first 

big screen appearance for all 
except Suljic, the group has 
actually been in the limelight 
for a number of years now, at 
least in Los Angeles, for their 
popular skating, clothing and 
cinema collective called Illegal 
Civilization 
(Illegal 
Civ). 

Friends and collaborators with 
big-name musicians like Tyler, 
The Creator, Frank Ocean and 
Vince Staples, the group has 
made several tours around 
the globe as a result of their 
endeavors.

Unaware of all of this going 

into the movie, however, I 
went into State Theatre’s free 
early screening of the film 
last Wednesday fairly free of 
expectation, other than that 
the name “Mid90s” sounded 
to me like another “Dazed and 
Confused” or “Kids.”

Walking in a few minutes 

late, I entered to a would-you-
rather conversation onscreen 
about having sex with your 
mom or your dad. The group of 
five friends were sitting on the 
couches of the skate shop, the 
workplace-turned-home for the 
crew. While you’d expect to be 
annoyed by this conversation, 

it immediately gives us insight 
into the sarcastic, carefree and 
light-hearted nature of the 
group.

Though their characters use 

certain homophobic and racist 
slurs that went unchecked two 
decades earlier, this kind of 
unbridled dialogue made the 
characters so believable that 
they retained their likeability. 
I wondered to myself later 
that night while discovering 
a treasure trove of Illegal Civ 
videos whether Jonah Hill had 
indeed written everything that 
ended up being said or whether 
he had let the group do what 
they had been doing for years 
prior in their YouTube film 
shorts.

Thus, 
given 
the 
chance 

the following day, I asked 
them what the their working 
dynamic with Jonah was to 
get the dialogue right. Sunny 
answered that they wanted to 
make sure to get all the slurs 
right, and they would often 
work for an hour before each 
scene talking this over. This 
wasn’t really what I was looking 
for, however, so I interjected — 
“I just … would you guys follow 
his 
writing 
specifically?” 

To this Sunny expeditiously 
responded that he had indeed 
read the script, and that none 
of it was improvised. Before 
he could finish, Ryder chimed 
in that all of the language 
was put in there for a reason, 
but before Ryder could finish 
Sunny 
interrupted 
saying: 

“shut the fu— yo, yo, no. I’m 
sorry. Continue.” From here, 
all cohesion in the conversation 
was lost. Ryder replied: “What 

the hell?” as all four members of 
the cast laughed. When the A24 
representative 
tried 
moving 

on, Sunny shouted, “Oh shit! I 
really just fucked up Ryder’s 
response, I’m sorry.” From 
here, Gio and Olan randomly 
quoted the movie, and before 
I knew it the conversation had 
descended into the same kind 
of headassery as many others 
had in the movie.

This 
hooliganism 
is 
just 

the byproduct of the cast’s 
closeness both on and off the 
set. In the movie, skating turns 
a group of kids from different 
walks of life into a family. Much 
the same is true for Illegal 
Civ. Their videos on YouTube 
promote 
self-expression, 

creativity and diversity through 
the common calling of skating. 
The linked video is the buildup 
to selling out a show of 500 at 
the Roxy Theater in LA back in 
early 2017. From the start, the 
collective’s positive creative 
energy is contagious. The show, 
for which they managed to get 
Compton’s Earl Swavey and 
Van Nuys’s Slow Hollows, is 
a celebration of rap, trap and 
rock and demonstrates how 
the common bond of music can 
get otherwise discrete cultural 
groups dancing together like 
there’s no tomorrow.

If “Mid90s” feels like a shout 

for the return of ’90s skatepark 
culture — a time in which 
cultural barriers were broken 
down for the sake of a common 
love — Illegal Civilization is 
answering that call. Jonah Hill 
has his cast to thank for making 
his musings a reality both on 
and off the big screen.

‘Mid90s’ soundtrack isn’t 
just a period piece copout

Movie 
soundtracks 
are 

delicate things. A soundtrack 
can make a powerful sequence or 
ruin one. It can enhance a line of 
dialogue or overpower it. It can 
flow easily or echo distractingly 
out-of-place. 
Soundtracks, 

depending on the degree of care 
a filmmaker takes to refine them, 
can make or break a movie. And 
for “Mid90s,” the soundtrack 
is endearing and meticulously 
composed.

Jonah 
Hill’s 
(“Maniac”) 

directorial debut may seem like 
just a period piece centered 
around skateboarding culture, 
but as the soundtrack reveals, it 
is rather a heartfelt coming-of-
age story that says as much about 
its period setting as it does about 
Hill himself. 

If you’re looking for a Best 

Hits of the Decade Compilation, 
look elsewhere. The truth is that 
the soundtrack of “Mid90s” is 
anything but cookie-cutter. It 
intentionally strays from the 
mawkishly overplayed singles 
from the era and instead aims for 
a far more personal connection 
that feels both unique and 
universal.

The tracklist darts effortlessly 

between 
genres, 
traversing 

Golden Age hip hop, grunge, 
hardcore 
punk 
and 
— 
you 

guessed it — Hungarian folk 
rock.

In 
particular, 
“Wave 
of 

Mutilation” 
by 
the 
Pixies 

combines quirky chord changes 
with ragged, angry vocals, a 
perfect metaphor for the story’s 
raging adolescence. 

These are clearly songs that 

Hill grew up with and remains 
close to after years. He elaborated 
on his thought process for 
curating the soundtrack on the 
“The Big Picture,” a podcast by 
The Ringer. 

“A large part of wanting to 

be a filmmaker for me is having 
music be presented the way that 
I associate it,” he said. Indeed, 
the track choices, despite not 
being the most famous of the era, 
evoke a specificity in experiences 
and memories. 

Perhaps the most endearing 

detail was the reason for which 
Hill chose the Nirvana song, 
“Where Did You Sleep Last 
Night” to be on the soundtrack.

“This (song) has this deep 

emotional connection to me 
because it was the first song I 
learned on guitar,” he admitted. 
The link one forms to a piece of 
music strengthens substantially 
when learning how to play it, 
and the anecdote is a perfect 
metaphor 
for 
the 
kind 
of 

individualistic 
attention 
Hill 

poured into developing the film’s 
auditory texture.

Another standout from the 

soundtrack is its final song, “We’ll 
Let You Know” by Morrissey, 
which ends the playlist with 
a grounded sense of maturity. 
Hill also includes songs from 
previous decades as the album 
goes on, such as “Watermelon 
Man” by the jazz pianist Herbie 

Hancock.

The soundtrack was released 

as a playlist on Spotify rather 
than an purchasable album, and 
the form points to why “Mid90s” 
is so much more than a period 
soundtrack. Hill does not want 
to merely drag listeners back to 
another decade in time; he wants 
to interact with us in a distinctly 
modern form.

The unsung star of the playlist, 

however, was not music from 
the ’90s at all. It was the film’s 
instrumental score, interwoven 
between era tracks, by none other 
than Trent Reznor and Atticus 
Ross (“The Social Network”). 

The score periodically offers 

a break between the intense 
period 
grooves 
and 
forces 

listeners to confront the innately 
human side of the story that 
Hill 
expresses. 
Sure, 
Hill’s 

unmistakably 
personal 
track 

choices shape the experience, 
but Reznor and Ross elevate 
these nuances into mellifluous, 
thrumming climaxes that imbue 
the soundtrack with a sense of 
momentum.

As Hill ingeniously intends, 

a listener can walk away from 
the playlist with a view into 
someone’s life in the mid-90s, 
not a bland aggregate of timely 
music.

“To me, the title ‘Mid90s’ was 

a joke,” he said, “because people 
would expect it to be like that 
’90s movie and then they get 
this kind of small emotional, 
hopefully moving film.” 

The soundtrack, at least, is 

undoubtedly all of these things.

PENN STATE
NOVEMBER 2, 2018


Behind Enemy Lines: 
PSU writer Tyler King

Before the season began, it 
seemed the Michigan football 
team’s entire 2018 would be 
defined by its three-game stretch 
against 
Wisconsin, 
Michigan 
State and Penn State, from middle 
October to early November. 
Two 
games 
through 
that 
stretch, 
the 
fifth-ranked 
Wolverines (7-1 overall, 5-0 Big 
Ten) have nearly made it out the 
other side unscathed. 
All that is left in Michigan’s 
season-defining span now are 
the 14th-ranked Nittany Lions 
(6-2, 3-2). 
Penn State was thought to 
be a national title contender 
at the start of the season, but 
after two heartbreaking losses 
to Ohio State and the Spartans, 
the Nittany Lions are now 
fighting an uphill battle to play 
meaningful late-season games. 
Of course, if they can overcome 
the Wolverines on Saturday, that 
narrative may be flipped on its 
head. 
To 
preview 
the 
top-15 
matchup, The Daily caught up 
with Tyler King, the football 
editor at Penn State’s student 
newspaper, The Daily Collegian, 
to ask about the importance of 
the game and how he sees things 
panning out.
The Michigan Daily: So, 
Michigan players have been 
talking, and the coaches have 
been talking a lot this week about 
last year’s game. I’m wondering 
how much talk there’s been on 
the Penn State end about that 
game.
Tyler King: Yeah, Penn State 
is like one of the few schools 
in the country, maybe the only 
school, that doesn’t do a big 
press 
conference, 
which 
is 
very frustrating from a content 
standpoint, but that’s beside the 
point. But they take this whole, 
1-0 each week mentality, treating 
every game like the Super Bowl, 
which is such a cliché, but they 
do it. For every game, they treat 
every game, not like it’s Akron, 
but there have been misconstrued 
quotes from, like, last year, where 
James Franklin says beating 
a team like (Pittsburgh), an 
in-state rival, is just as important 
as beating Akron.
So, I mean, they haven’t really 

talked about it too much, because 
honestly even today, the players 
and James Franklin were asked 
about two years ago, the game at 
The Big House, which Michigan 
won, 49-10. And they kind of just 
shrugged those questions off, 
like, ‘Yeah, that happened, but 
we’re just focused on this year’s 
game and this year’s Michigan 
team.’ They usually like to shrug 
those questions off and they don’t 
heavily talk about that game a lot 
from last year. Obviously it was a 
whiteout game and Penn State’s 
had success in the whiteout the 
last couple of years. Obviously 
this year losing by one point to 
Ohio State, but in general, usually 
the whiteout has been successful. 
I just think that was just a product 
of two teams last year where 
Penn State was just clearly better 
and in that home environment it 
just kind of showed.
TMD: And about those two 
losses, both of them have sort 
of come at the last minute in 
heartbreaking fashion. Does it 
feel at all like a team demoralized 
by those or are they sort of 
rallying around finishing strong 
here?
TK: Yeah, like I said, they do 
that annoying, kind of, 1-0-each-
week kind of thing, and James 
Franklin said that after they beat 
Iowa this past week. Another 
beat reporter asked about, you 
know, does this kind of, maybe 
breathe some life into the team? 
And James kind of really just 
played that question off and just 
said, ‘Look, we’re 1-0 this week. 
We’re happy we won this week.’ 
So, I mean, after the Ohio State 
game, the vibe that I got from 
talking to players and especially 
a guy like Trace McSorley, who 
had, I mean, just an unbelievable 
performance against Ohio State, 
they felt kind of confident. I 
mean, in my opinion, I thought 
Penn State was the better team 
for three quarters, and then they 
just had another fourth-quarter 
collapse and they lost by one 
point. So I didn’t think they were 
very defeated.
But after Michigan State, I 
could feel it, talking to players, 
that they were kind of defeated. 
And obviously now, that was 
three weeks ago, so I mean, I 
would have a good feeling they 
put those two games behind 
them. But, I mean, definitely

after the Michigan State game, 
you could kind of feel the vibe with 
the players, especially with a guy 
like Trace McSorley, who didn’t play 
his best game that day. The offense 
as a whole struggled, only scoring 
17 points. He seemed kind of — he 
seemed very defeated after that 
game. But now I think they’ve kind 
of rebounded and yeah, this game 
right here is going to decide their 
season — whether or not they have a 
chance at a New Year’s Six bowl or 
whether they’re looking at, maybe 
like, a Holiday Bowl or an Outback 
Bowl or Citrus Bowl appearance or 
something like that.
I think of this as the toughest 
game on their whole schedule. 
This is tougher than the Ohio State 
game, because that’s a whiteout 
game at home. This is a road game 
in a stadium that the Penn State 
program has not had a lot of success 
at this century. So they seem ready 
for this game, but like I said, they 
treat every game the same — at least 
they put on that mirage that they do.
TMD: From a national perspective 
going into the year, the narrative 
around Penn State was, how are they 

gonna replace Saquon Barkley. How 
do you think they’ve replaced Saquon 
Barkley both on the field and from a 
leadership standpoint?
TK: Yeah, from a leadership 
standpoint, I don’t think there’s 
been any — they have plenty of 
good veterans on this team and 
quality leaders. Obviously with 
Trace McSorley they have that. 
And replacing (Barkley) from a 
production standpoint, I mean, 
James Franklin said before the year, 
you can’t replace Saquon Barkley 
because he’s a once-in-a — the 
program’s never gonna have a player 
like Saquon Barkley again, because 
just his innate talent and his work 
ethic and things like that, it’s just 
never gonna happen.
But in my opinion, and I’ve said 
this all year long, I think Miles 
Sanders is a better fit for this Penn 
State offense than Saquon was. 
Watching Saquon for three years 
and being a huge NFL fan like I am, 
I think Saquon is better fit for a pro-
style offense where the quarterback 
is under center, and Penn State never 
goes under center. So I think Miles 
Sanders is just more fit for this type 
of system. And, obviously, he doesn’t 
have the same numbers that Saquon 
did last year, but I still think he’s been 

incredibly productive. I mean, he 
had a game against Illinois in which 
he ran all over them. He had exactly 
200 yards and three touchdowns. 
He’s put up big numbers in just about 
every game except I think two: 
against Ohio State and then this past 
week against Iowa he didn’t really 
do much. But he didn’t have a lot of 
touches in either of those games for 
whatever reason.
Yeah, I think Miles Sanders is up 
there. When I mention (Michigan 
running back) Karan Higdon in 
the top three (running backs in the 
Big Ten), I think Miles Sanders is 
in the top three as well. I think he, 
(Wisconsin’s) Jonathan Taylor and 
Karan Higdon are the three best 
running backs in this conference. I 
think Sanders has done a very good 
job this season.
TMD: McSorley has taken a slight 
tick down, I would say, statistically 
this year. Have you seen any sort of 
drop-off, or is that not necessarily 
representative of how he’s been 
playing?
TK: Definitely passing, his stats 
are down (from what) they were 
the past two seasons. I think, just, 
with the way this offense has had to 
adjust and had to work this season, I 
wrote a story last week about Trace 

McSorley and his ability as a runner 
this season, because he’s become 
that. He’s no longer this player that 
is chucking it deep to his talented 
wide receivers and letting them go 
get it as a product of Joe Moorhead’s 
offense.
… But yeah, Trace McSorley the 
last two seasons had 10 total 300-
yard passing games — five in each 
season. This season, through eight 
games now, he doesn’t have any. 
I think he’s only thrown for over 
230 yards once. So, I mean, as a 
passer, yeah. The stats show that 
he’s taken a step back, and there 
have been some games where he 
hasn’t looked as accurate, but he’s 
really just getting no help from 
his wide receivers. I mean, one of 
the big talking points this entire 
season has been the inexperience 
of this wide receiver group and the 
drops that have plagued them. Even 
the veterans that they have like 
DeAndre Thompkins and Juwan 
Johnson haven’t been nearly as 
productive as many people thought 
they would coming into the year. 
The only two, receiving — reliable, 
consistent, receiving targets that 
McSorley has is redshirt freshman 
KJ Hamler … and then another 
freshman, true freshman tight end 

Pat Freiermuth who has been really 
impressive.
… (McSorley) has been whatever 
Penn State needs him to be, and I 
think that is the biggest thing this 
season for him. He’s still playing 
at a Heisman-caliber level in my 
opinion, and even though that’s not 
as a passer, it’s more as a runner, he’s 
still been incredibly impressive.
TMD: If Penn State’s gonna win 
this game, they need to do…?
TK: It’s gonna come down to, can 
they play well enough on offense to 
get the job done against this really 
talented Michigan defense.
TMD: Do you have a prediction?
TK: Like I said, I don’t really 
think it’s gonna be all that close. I 
think this Michigan team is really 
dominant, and like I said, Penn State 
in the past has not really had a lot 
of success at The Big House. And 
the offense, right now, is just not at 
the level where I can fathom them 
scoring more than, like, 20 points 
against a defense like this on the 
road. I mean, they struggled to move 
the ball against an Iowa team that 
really wasn’t that impressive to me 
on tape.
So, yeah, I think I’m gonna go 
somewhere around Michigan 31, 
Penn State 17.

BEHIND ENEMY LINES
From Page 2B

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily
The Michigan and Penn State football teams will face off on Saturday for the first time since the Nittany Lions dominated the Wolverines, 42-13, in front of a whiteout crowd in State College last season.


come in and make an impact.”

This was a guy who would find his way 

on the field or die trying.

There was a time when Mason 

thought that would come on special 

teams exclusively, so he honed his craft 

at long-snapper. He still wants to play 

long-snapper.

“I’m still thinking of doing 

that in the next couple years,” 

says the sophomore fullback 

with six touchdowns on the 

season.

He means it, too.

***

After he accepted the head 

coaching job at San Diego, 

Harbaugh 
promised 
Bo 

Schembechler that as long as 

he coached, there would be a 

fullback on the roster. 

Now, 14 years later, that sentiment 

still stands at Michigan. Fullback 

is a foundational component of this 

program, inextricably linked to its 

identity. That extends to the role on 

the field, sure. But to Mason, it’s deeper 

than that.

“I think playing the fullback position 

is a mentality more than anything 

else,” Mason said. “It’s not something 

physical, it’s not even your athleticism 

… when it comes down to it, just having 

the mindset that you’re going to come 

downhill, and you’re going to make 

plays for the team no matter what.”

Harbaugh 
once 
said 
he 
thinks 

football is “the last bastion of hope for 

toughness in America in men.”

If you subscribe to that kind of 

rhetoric, 
Mason 
might 
be 
your 

Messiah. His high school tape is 

an absurd — even comical, if you 

partake in Schadenfreude — array of 

bludgeonings.

His nearly two years at Michigan 

have been full of the same. Physicality 

is his persona, and he wears it in his 

emotions, his interests, his voice and, 

mostly, his play. A pure fullback.

And yet, the ilk of Ben Mason is a dying 

breed across the sport of football. 

Michigan currently lists six fullbacks 

on its roster; six of the other top-12 

teams in the College Football Playoff 

rankings don’t even list one.

Michigan’s embrace of the fullback 

isn’t just abnormal in this modern 

era 
of 
football. 
It’s 
borderline 

unprecedented.

In 2017, Pro Football Focus graded 18 

fullbacks total in the NFL. Roughly 10 

percent of snaps in the NFL this season 

have included two-back personnel, 

according to sharpfootballstats.com. 

As teams at all levels of football use 

more spread concepts, the fullback has 

rapidly devolved.

“So my question is what’s the next 

step?” asked ESPN writer and analyst 

Matt Bowen.

Some believe there will come a day 

in which the fullback as we know it 

disappears. Others think it will remain 

but continue to dwindle in relevance. 

Bowen has theories of his own.

Right now, he sees a role for fullback 

with different skills, rather than the 

traditional downhill style. He points 

to Kyle Juszczyk of the San Francisco 

49ers as a prime example.

“I think the first thing is versatility. 

Can you catch the football? Can you 

play a role in the passing game? Because 

if you don’t, then you’re limited in 

terms of game situation,” Bowen said. 

“And also formation flexibility. You 

want to be able to line in an I-set and 

get downhill. I think you also have to 

be able to motion to shift outside to run 

a route and catch a football.”

Both his coaches — George and 

Harbaugh — seem to think Mason has 

that ability.

George: He has a lot of different 

weapons in his arsenal. He has very 

good hands. He’s a tough runner. Really 

good north/south runner. ... He’s also 

a very good blocker. He picks up the 

schemes quick. When you have a kid like 

that, I think it’s very easy to introduce 

him into the offense and work him into 

the different sets and plays.

Harbaugh: He’s got the ability to do a 

lot. Catch the ball out of the backfield, 

block, run. It’s an expanding package 

with Ben.

In an ecosystem predicated on 

zigging while others zag, Bowen sees 

a possibility — even a likelihood — for 

the return of smashmouth offense.

“You’re going to see a return of more 

power football, where offenses say, 

‘OK, if you’re going to build your 

defenses on speed, we’re going to 

start bringing back power football and 

getting downhill more,’ ” Bowen said. 

“If that’s the case and that happens, 
then you’ll see the return of the 
fullback.
“I think it’s gonna come back. I really 
believe that.”
Mason, for his part, isn’t going to lose 
sight of who he is or what drives his 
passion. If you asked him whether 
he loves football, Don Brown posited 
Wednesday, “he might swing.” (This 
reporter didn’t dare test that.) He’s 
certainly not going to conform to 
some trend to appease any NFL 
goals.
But he has NFL goals and he’s 

not blind to what he might need 
to accomplish to get there. He 
strays 
from 
confronting 
those 

goals directly (his team goal is “to 
win” and his individual goal is to 
“help the team”). Above the fame 
or fortune, Mason wants to keep 
playing football because he couldn’t 
imagine life without it.
The sport of football is so deeply 
ingrained in who Mason is; he won’t 
let some modern-day trend deter 
that. He’s just trying to hit people. 
And make a living doing it.
If that means expanding his 
repertoire to adapt? All the better.
“I think down the line, I definitely 
have to prove myself as a reliable 
route-runner, pass-catcher,” Mason 
said. “I’m looking forward to doing 
that.
“I’m thinking right now of a 
snowball 
effect. 
In 
anything, 

once you do something and you’re 
productive with it, they’re only 
going to give you more of a role.”
Anything specific?
“What more can I do?” he poses 
rhetorically, as if there’s a self-
imposed limit. 
As if the answer is anything short of 
“whatever I’m asked.”

Ben Mason speaks and it’s hard not to 

be startled.

His voice lowers. His eyes wander. His 

mohawk protrudes.

“It’s just a football position,” he says 

with a visceral appreciation for being a 

fullback. “For football players.”

This is one side of Ben Mason; the 

overtly gruff brute of a human being. 

This is the Ben Mason who will tell 

you how much he enjoys hitting people 

as many times — in as many ways — 

as you’ll ask. In two short years, that 

public persona has evolved from cult 

hero to the stuff of legend. “Bench” 

Mason, he’s called. That’s all real.

Those who know him best speak to 

another side, though.

His friend and high school teammate, 

Tom Long, tells of the Ben Mason who, 

at an eighth grade dance, requested 

the DJ play an Adele song so that he 

could sing it in front of the whole class, 

channeling his best impersonation.

“Spot on, too,” Long said.

That’s the Ben Mason who compelled 

his high school team to partake in the 

“Mannequin Challenge” when it was 

making the rounds on social media.

Former Michigan fullback and now-

graduate assistant coach Henry Poggi 

tells of a young freshman looking to 

find his way. The two were roommates 

during Mason’s first fall camp. Poggi 

— a starting fullback at the time — 

referred to Mason as his “son.”

After watching a Facebook video on 

the virtues of making your bed, Poggi 

decided it would be the first thing he 

did each morning. Mason, being the 

impressionable freshman he was, 

decided he would do the same.

Then, one day during camp, Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh asked Mason 

to give the “Wise Words” after 

practice — a tradition in which one 

player offers a message of inspiration 

before ending the day. Players take 

the opportunity seriously, especially 

younger players like Mason looking to 

make an impression. Some opt for an 

inspirational quote or advice a coach 

gave them. Others choose a poem.

Mason took a different route.

“Ben had been talking to me about it,” 

Poggi recalls, “and he said he wanted to 

talk about how we make our beds every 

morning and how that gets us going.

“I’m like, ‘All right, you wanna run it 

through with me, so that it’s fresh in 

your mind so you sound good up there?’ 

”

Mason declined. He had it all covered.

That is, until his moment arrived. 

Called up in front of the team to deliver 

his remarks, Mason’s mind wandered. 

He stared off into the distance for 10 

seconds, Poggi estimates. 

“People are kinda looking around like 

‘What on earth is this guy gonna say?’ ”

Then he started talking.

Every day, in the morning, me and Poggi 

wake up, and we yell at each other! And 

then we make our beds!

“And people are, like, waiting for it,” 

Poggi said. “He didn’t really know what 

else to say, he just knew that he wanted 

to talk about making beds. But he was 

so excited, he hadn’t thought about 

what really the point was to making 

beds.”

And it gets our day going!

From there, with nothing else to offer, 

Mason sprung into full panic mode, 

looking around in a plea for help. 

Harbaugh stepped in and gave Mason 

a hug.

“Ben,” he said, “that was awesome.”

“It was the best “Wise Words” because 

it was so genuine, so Ben Mason,” Poggi 

said. “Some guys will go up there and 

just talk and talk and talk.

“Ben, a man of few words, just wanted 

to talk about making beds.”

***

Ben Mason wasn’t always a fullback, 

though those around him seem to 

think the position was a matter of 

preordained fate.

“Ben is like a natural fullback,” Poggi 

said “He was put on this earth to play 

fullback.”

The first time Poggi met Mason was 

during Mason’s recruiting trip. The 

Newtown, Conn. native was donning a 

skin-tight blue jacket.

“Wow, who on earth is this kid?” Poggi 

thought. “Hopefully I’ll be gone before 

he gets here.”

At the time, Mason still held out some 

hope of playing linebacker. Defensive 

coordinator Don Brown recruited 

Mason at the position while he was 

at Boston College. When Brown was 

hired at Michigan, Mason came too. 

He loved Brown’s scheme and the 

defensive coordinator’s passion.

Mason enrolled early and spent most 

of his first spring on the defensive side 

of the ball.

“I think that’s where coach Harbaugh 

wanted him at first, when they were 

initially recruiting him,” said Steve 

George, Mason’s high school coach. 

“I think Ben really wanted to play 

linebacker at the time.”

He was fast, but not quite Devin Bush-

beating-a-running-back-to-the-edge 

fast. He was agile, but hardly Khaleke 

Hudson-shedding-blockers agile.

His strengths, unsurprisingly, were in 

run defense and sheer physicality.

Harbaugh and his staff liked what they 

saw when Mason went forward. So 

after Mason’s first spring they asked 

a simple, but ultimately prophetic, 

question: Why can’t he do that 

all the time?

“We felt like he was so 

good as a downhill type of 

linebacker that, to be able to 

do that all the time, to be a 

downhill, aggressive football 

player,” 
Harbaugh 
said, 

“fullback would be a great 

position for him.”

One day, Harbaugh called 

Mason and asked what he 

thought of a full-time move 

to fullback. Mason didn’t 

hesitate in his response.

“Oh, I would do anything that was 

right for the team,” he said Wednesday, 

thinking back, “and that I was excited 

to do it.”

To some, that cliche of “doing anything 

for the team” comes off as disingenuous 

lip-service. This was anything but.

“The biggest thing with me: I wanted to 

come in and make an impact no matter 

how I could do it,” Mason said. “And 

I was going to find a way no matter to

What to watch for when No. 5 Michigan faces No. 14 Penn State

There is no sugarcoating what 
is at stake for the Michigan 
football 
team 
in 
Saturday’s 
matchup against No. 14 Penn 
State.
Win, and the team’s floor — 
barring shocking upsets against 
Indiana and Rutgers — is a New 
Year’s Six bowl game. Lose, 
and that scenario becomes a lot 
more difficult. Coupled with the 
desire to avenge last year’s 42-13 
beatdown in Happy Valley, the 
fifth-ranked 
Wolverines 
(7-1 
overall, 5-0 Big Ten) simply have 
more to lose than the Nittany 
Lions (6-2, 3-2).
Michigan is coming off a bye 
week riding a seven-game win 
streak, while Penn State visits 
Michigan Stadium after escaping 
with a 30-24 home victory against 
Iowa.
The Daily breaks down what 
to watch for in the third game of 
the Wolverines’ self-proclaimed 
Revenge Tour.
Containing Trace McSorley
Alternatively, this could just 
be titled “Devin Bush Jr. needs 
to have a career game.” Sure, 
a 
defense 
that 
surrendered 
506 
yards 
and 
five 
rushing 
touchdowns a year ago is a call to 
arms for all 11 guys on the field. 
But last year, McSorley and now-
New York Giant Saquon Barkley 
did much of their damage from 
over-pursuing 
defenders 
and 
pure speed. It was a particularly 
tough night for Mike McCray, 
who was burned on two of the 
Nittany Lions’ scoring drives by 
the duo.
For 
Bush, 
spying 
McSorley 
effectively 
is 
priority 
number 
one. 
McCray 
wasn’t an answer 
last year, and Josh 
Ross 
or 
Devin 
Gil shouldn’t be 
the 
replacement. 
Miles 
Sanders 
has 
displayed 
All-American 
ability and could present similar 
problems, but he’s not Barkley. 
Thus, eyes are cast squarely 
on the quarterback. Imagine 
this scenario: Chase Winovich 
and Kwity Paye seal the edges, 
leaving a running gap open up the 
middle with Penn State receivers 
streaking up field. Except you 
don’t have to imagine, because 

Barkley did it out of the wildcat 
and McSorley succeeded with it 
too last season.
McSorley is also a capable 
passer, 
of 
course. 
Speedster 
K.J. Hamler is the prototypical 
slot receiver that can catch the 
ball and fly behind Michigan’s 
linebackers. 
Six-foot-4 
Juwan 
Johnson 
and 
6-foot-5 
Pat 
Freiermuth have combined for 
five 
touchdowns 
themselves. 
McSorley 
is 
a 
serviceable 
quarterback, 
but 
his 
110 
rushing 
attempts this year 
make the message 
clear: keep him 
from taking off.
Keeping 
the 
Michigan 
offense on the 
field
Michigan ranks 
seventh 
in 
the 
country in time 
of possession, averaging around 
34 minutes per game on offense. 
For a Wolverine offense that can 
be maddeningly slow, it’s easy to 
dismiss the number. Defensive 
coordinator Don Brown can tell 
you why he loves it.
“There were a couple points 
against 
Michigan 
State 
I’m 
like — I’m sitting with the guys 

and Bush is here and Khaleke 
(Hudson is) here and I’m like 
‘Dude, that’s five minutes off the 
clock,’ ” Brown said. “And that’s 
huge when you can go out there 
and just sell your soul to get off 
the field, and you’re rewarded by 
the offense just dominating the 
clock. That’s a big deal.
Don’t have to score, but field 
position and giving you the rest 
so you can be 100 miles an hour, 
that’s a big deal.”
Brown even put on his research 
cap on to dissect the impact even 
further.
“I did this study last year on us, 
and when we are below 70 snaps — 
in the sixties — we’re pretty good 
now,” Brown said. “When we get 
into the high seventies, eighties, 
that’s when trouble starts. That’s 
when fatigue’s done, concept is 
out there and it’s a bad deal.
“In the last seven games, we’re 
somewhere high-forties to mid-
sixties, which is a heck of a deal. 
I think if you asked a couple Big 
12 defensive coordinators, they’d 
take it and run.”
Penn State averages nearly 84.9 
defensive plays per game, and 92 
its past three games. Keeping 
Michigan’s offense on the field 
seems easier said than done, but it 
could be the key to topping a team 

that lost some playmakers.
Tarik Black is back
On 
Tuesday, 
senior 
wide 
receiver Grant Perry offered 
some encouraging, but curious 
insight regarding the health of 
Black, who is eyeing his first 
game action of the season after 
fracturing his left foot. He also 
missed the last 10 games last year 
from a broken right foot, earning 
him a medical redshirt.
“Coming back from an injury 
like that, there’s 
going to be some 
cloudiness coming 
back 
on 
the 
field, 
definitely 
some 
doubts,” 
Perry 
said. 
“He’s 
definitely 
overcome that gap 
and he’s back to 
being Tarik.”
What 
does 
being Tarik mean? 
Based on limited anecdotes from 
one spring game and three games 
over a year ago, it means being 
a playmaker that can spread 
the field that much more. Black 
can catch the deep ball, and 
can also play inside like he did 
when catching his first and only 
touchdown in his career debut 
against Florida in 2017.

Coinciding with improvements 
made by counterparts Donovan 
Peoples-Jones and Nico Collins, 
and tight end Zach Gentry, the 
various 
formations 
that 
the 
Wolverines can employ with 
Black in the lineup could leave 
opposing defensive coordinators 
sweating.
Bottom line
Penn State has the offensive 
weapons to expose holes in 
Michigan’s 
defense. 
But 
its 
offense 
is 
still 
worse than last 
year, 
and 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
is 
the 
same, if not better. 
McSorley doesn’t 
have 
the 
same 
parachute 
to 
get out of tricky 
situations.
Michigan’s 
offense, 
on 
the 
other hand, has trended upward 
week over week. Penn State’s 
defense has allowed at least three 
touchdowns 
in 
four 
straight 
games. And yeah, Shea Patterson 
in Ann Arbor is an improvement 
over John O’Korn in Happy 
Valley, to put it mildly.
Prediction: 
Michigan 
28, 
Penn State 17

EVAN AARON/Daily
Redshirt freshman Tarik Black is seemingly going to return from injury against Penn State on Saturday, after sitting out the last 18 games for the Wolverines.

“(You) sell your 
soul to get off 
the field, and 
you’re...

... rewarded by 
the offense just 
dominating the 
clock.”

After much improvement, another test awaits Jon Runyan

Jon Runyan Jr. was hesitant to 
watch his team’s season-opening loss 
at Notre Dame. The redshirt junior left 
tackle knew it would make him sick to 
his stomach. But last Friday, for the 
first time, he chose to anyway.
What Runyan saw was not always 
pretty. There were plays he, self-
admittedly, got caught in the heat of 
the moment. There were others where 
his technique evaded him.
“Just looking at it like, ‘Wow, that 
was probably actually a really bad play 
I had right there,’ ” Runyan said.
So why did Runyan relive the 
Wolverines’ lone loss during his only 
off-weekend of the fall? He wanted a 
reminder of how far he had come.
Runyan thinks his improvement 
started in Michigan’s win over 
Nebraska on Sept. 22. Then he felt 
another jump two weeks later against 
Wisconsin.
“Those two games, I thought I 
played really well,” Runyan said. “We 
were just having fun out there. Those 
games were really fun. Especially 
(Wisconsin) under the lights, on 
ESPN, 8:30. Those are the games you 
grow up watching and live for.”
After allowing three sacks against 

the Fighting Irish, the Wolverines 
have allowed just ten combined 
quarterback drops in the seven games 
since.
The offensive line’s collective 
growth 
was 
most 
apparent 
in 
Michigan’s victory over Michigan 
State. Against one of the country’s top-
ranked run defenses, Michigan ran for 
183 yards as its offensive line helped 
seal the victory down the stretch.
“Watching the Michigan State 
game as a unit with the offensive 
linemen, in the locker room, it was 
just unbelievable,” Runyan said. “I’ve 
never seen a locker room with that 
much atmosphere in there. Everybody 
in the Michigan State game had an 
overwhelming sense of pride in what 
we did.”
That’s quite the contrast from the 
sickness Runyan felt when replaying 
the Notre Dame game. During his 
press conference Tuesday, he repeated 
that his goal for the remainder of the 
season was to feel that way again.
A test to that, however, comes 
this weekend. Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh said that Penn State has 
the best defensive line the Wolverines 
have faced this season.
And on paper, even with the likes 
of Michigan State and Wisconsin 
in the rearview mirror, it’s easy to 

understand why Harbaugh feels that 
way.
The Nittany Lions rank fourth 
nationally with 28 sacks on the year. 
Yetur Gross-Matos — the reigning 
Big Ten Player of the Week — has two 
sacks in each of Penn State’s past two 
games. He and defensive end Shareef 
Miller have combined for 10 tackles 

and 21 tackles for loss this season.
“Really, 
the 
whole 
group 
is 
impressive,” Harbaugh said. “Like I 
said, I think it’s the best that we’ve 
played so far. Aggressive group that 
is very strong (on) inside pass-rush, as 
well as speed and power on the edge.”
That combination of speed and 
power is one that Runyan struggled 

against on Sept. 1. His improvement 
since then has been undeniable, but 
Gross-Matos and Miller will test just 
how far Runyan has come.
“We did a good job (against 
Michigan State),” Runyan said. “… 
Hopefully we carry that over to Penn 
State. Cause their team really likes to 
bring pressure, too.”
