Testing of new
surgical treatment
moves to Phase II
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily StaffReporter
Though the Food and Drug
Administration remains closed
due to the federal government
shutdown, researchers at the
University are pushing for-
ward the development of stem-
cell therapies, with the hope of
improving the quality of life for
individuals with life-threatening
disabilities.
Researchers at University
Hospital and the A. Alfred Taub-
man Medical Research Institute
are exploringthe use of stem cells
in the treatment of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis - also known as
Lou Gerhig's disease, a neurode-
generative condition that causes
cell death in spinal cord neurons
that control movement. Patients
with ALS suffer from loss of mus-
cle control and often die of respi-
ratory failure.
Neurology Prof. Eva Feldman
presented recent results from her
research at an event Wednesday
evening at the Taubman Insti-
tute's Kahn Auditorium for an
audience of about F40 students

and faculty. Feldman discussed
the completion of Phase I trials
of the new stem-cell therapy and
her plans for Phase IL
While Phase I trials typically
test the safety of a treatment in
human patients, Phase II tests the
treatment's efficacy. Feldman's
research team received approval
for Phase II of their research in
May and has since begun tests.
Shortly before the event
Wednesday afternoon, a third
patient enrollei in the trial had
the surgical procedure, in which
a surgeon injects stem cells into
specific regions of the spinal
cord. Although it is too early to
record changes in disease pro-
gression, Feldman said the three
patients have experienced "no
adverse consequences" from the
procedure.
Stem cells have the unique
ability to fulfill a wide variety
of tasks by developing into spe-
cialized cells depending on their
environment. When these cells
are injected into the spinal cord
of ALS patients, they surround
diseased cells and slow the pro-
gression of cell death, Feldman
said.
"Depending on how you grow
them ... they can become any cell
in the body," Feldman said.
Feldman's treatment uses a

Pierpont Commons,
Mitchell Field to
recieve upgrades
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporter
North Campus-ers feeling
left out from the dizzying resi-
dence-hall renovations on Cen-
tral Campus will soon have their
own to boast about - albeit on a
smaller scale.
The Commons Cafe is sched-

uled to close for renovations
in March as part of a larger,
campus-wide project to update
student facilities initiated by
Building a Better Michigan, a
student-run organization creat-
ed to advise renovations across
campus.
Through 2020, the project
hopes to bring improvements to
aging facilities including Mitch-
ell Field, the three recreational
sports buildings and two of the
three unions.
Built in 1965, Pierpont Com-
mons has apparently lost much

of its student appeal. Through
information from student sur-
veys distributed by Building a
Better Michigan, dissatisfaction
with the food options and usable
study and organizational spaces
became apparent.
"(Pierpont Commons) doesn't
offer healthy, affordable and
attractive dining options," LSA
senior Louis Mirante, co-chair of
Building a Better Michigan, said.
"It doesn't facilitate the academ-
ic, social or physical well-being to
the degree that itshould."
Renovations to the cafe hope

to address this by offering an
increased variety in food choic-
es and better study space.
Four new, restaurant-like
serving areas will bring in a
range of quality cuisine, such
as those found in the recently
renovated dining hall of East
Quad Residence Hall. A 'Fire &
Ice' station is in talks to serve
freshly-prepared Ramen or
stir-fry; a hearth-oven station
will serve gourmet flat-bread
pizzas and freshly baked bread;

'Generation' will
compete in four-day,
1,800-mile race in
Australian desert
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
One hundred team mem-
bers. Seven national champion-
ship titles. Five top-three world
championship finishes. This
Sunday, the University Solar Car
Team is competing in the World
Solar Car Challenge, and they're
hoping this will be their year.
After spending the last two
years building and designing
Generation, the team's latest car,
several members have traveled
to the Australian outback, where
they'll compete with teams from
around the world in a1,800-mile
race to the finish and the title of
world solar-car champion.
Over the course of four days,
competitors from 40 schools
and 23 countries will race from
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and then charge
their cars until 7 a.m. the next

morning for the next day of rac-
ing.
LSA junior Ian Sullivan, the
team's business director, spoke
to The Michigan Daily from Ari-
zona, where he was currently
attending a sponsorship confer-
ence. He said he learned at the
conference how to effectively
work with companies to gain
resources for the coming year.
"We're all definitely really
excited about Sunday's race,"
Sullivan said. "Though we're
proud to consistently be in the
top, this is our best chance ever
to win, and that's always our
goal, so we feel like we just need
to go in and take it."
Sullivan noted a rule change
this year that mandates thateach
car have four wheels instead
,of three, which will make this
year's car more efficient and
competitive. He said the team
is always working on improving
technology and sustainability,
but this has probably been the
most major change their design
has undergone.

Are there any experiences

There were many experi-

program then I switched into
the BBA program, and I also
went to law school at Michi-
gan. The same time that I was
going to school, I was starting

businesses; I had five different
businesses that I started over
the course of my time in Ann
Arbor, and I had a number of
employees by the time that I
was a senior. And the process
of starting and growing busi-
nesses across various disci-
plines while at the same time
going to school offered me lots
of experiences and lessons that
I still use.
As both a professor and
entrepreneur, how do you

experiences into your

I lecture at the University
at least once a year, and I also
teach an MBA-level class on
technology and entrepreneur-

ship at the University of Chi-
cago Booth School of Business,
and I try to bring as much of my
experience as an entrepreneur
and my experience building
business into the classroom. I
both tell stories from my busi-
ness life and use real-world
examples from growing busi-
nesses as the context of dis-
cussion in the classroom and
the students really appreciate
having that type of access and
interaction around things that
are going on in the real world
right now.

Government shutdown hits
hard for American Indian tribes

Tribal programs
take cuts and
furloughs hundreds
CROW AGENCY, Mont. (AP)
- American Indian tribes have
more than access to national
parks on the line with the gov-
ernment shutdown, as federal
funding has been cut off for
crucial services including foster
care payments, nutrition pro-
grams and financial assistance
for the needy.
For the 13,000 members of
southeast Montana's Crow
Tribe, the budget impasse had
immediate and far-reaching
effects: Tribal leaders fur-
loughed more than 300 workers
Wednesday, citing the shut-
down and earlier federal budget
cuts.
As a result, tribal programs
including home health care for
the elderly and disabled, bus ser-
vice for rural areas, and a major

irrigation project were suspend-
ed indefinitely.
"It's going to get hard," said
Shar Simpson, who leads the
Crow's home health care pro-
gram. "We're already taking
calls from people saying, 'Who's
going to take care of my mom?
Who's going to take care of my
dad?"'
Some tribes intend to fill the
gap in federal funds themselves,
risking deficits of their own
to cushion communities with
chronic high unemployment and
poverty against the effects of the
budget battle.
"Do we just throw kids onto
the street, or do we help them?
Most likely we're going to help
those families and do whatever
we can until this is unresolved,"
said Tracy "Ching" King, presi-
dent of northern Montana's Fort
Belknap Reservation.
But for other tribes, basic ser-
vices stand to take a direct hit.
That includes programs heavily
subsidized by federal agencies

5550MB

and others paid for with tribal
money that is suddenly unavail-
able because it's being held by
the Department of Interior, trib-
al leaders said.
Essential activities such as law
enforcement, firefighting and
some social services will contin-
ue, said Bureau of Indian Affairs
spokeswoman Nedra Darling.
Programs that did not make the
list include residential care for
children and adults, cash assis-
tance for the poor and payments
to vendors who provide foster
care.
How long those programs will
continue on reservations depends
on the duration of the shutdown
and how much money individual
tribes can spare. The BIA pro-
vides services to more than 1.7
million American Indians and
Alaska Natives from more than
500 recognized tribes.
Crow Chairman Darrin Old
Coyote said his tribe decided to
furlough workers now, hoping
the move will be only temporary,
rather than push into deficit a
budget stretched thin by earlier
federal cuts and recent declines
in revenue from a coal mine on
the reservation.
"We're taking a proactive
approach," Old Coyote said. The
316 furloughed workers represent
about half the tribe's employees.
In South Dakota, Yankton
Sioux Tribe Vice Chairwoman
Jean Archambeau said the shut-
down means money for heating
assistance won't be coning this
fall.
"I don't know what we're going
to do," she said. "They're already
predicting snow out west and
possibly in this area of the state."
General assistance payments,
which help people with gen-
eral needs not covered by other
programs, also have been cut,
Archambeau said.
The National Congress of
American Indians and tribal.
leaders said the "double wham-
my" of the shutdown and the
earlier automatic spending, cuts
known as sequestration illus-
trates their vulnerability in the
federal budget process.

said. "It's a friendly competi-

This year, MPowered not
only hopes to expand to other
campuses, but integrate itself
further into the University
community as well. Wloch is
optimistic about new tactics
to expand 1,000 Pitches's out-
reach on campus this year,
using methods such as "Pitch
Stations" - which will allow
students to pitch on the go -
and new social-media strate-
gies.
The organization is also
hoping to set up sponsored
pitch stations - the typical
pitch stations accompanied by
representatives from an entre-
preneurial company. Students,
along with pitching the idea on
video, will be able to pitch their
idea to the company on site and
receive feedback.
Wloch envisions that the
sponsored "Pitch Stations" will
change the process of recruit-
ing.
"(Companies) can see stu-
dents' creative processes at
work, and then they can see
how they develop the pitch,"
Wloch said. "So rather than
just finding out someone's
name and getting a resume,
you really get to see what the
person is like and how they
might be able to work for your
company."
He said he views 1,000
Pitches as a platform for fur-
ther development.
"We can encourage win-
ners of 1,000'pitches and par-
ticipants to start using other
projects within MPowered to
develop themselves," Wloch
said.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Doctor accused of
fraud to stay in jail
A Detroit-area cancer doctor
accused of intentionally misdi-
agnosing patients and ordering
unnecessary treatments will
remain in jail until trial, a judge
said Wednesday after prosecu-
tors insisted he might flee to the
Middle East.
Dr. Farid Fata, in custody since
Aug. 6, wanted the judge to lower
his $9 million bond to $500,000
and give him a chance to win
release. But the decision was
worse for the Oakland County
O man: No bond.
"Obviously there is a presump-
tion of innocence ... but the court
feels there is a serious risk of flight.
The charges are serious," U.S. Dis-
trict Judge Paul Borman said.
SEATTLE
Tesla Model S fire
worries investors
Flames that engulfed the front
end of a Tesla electric car near
Seattle also burned in the vehicle's
battery pack, making it difficult
for firefighters to extinguish the
blaze, according to documents
obtained by The Associated Press.
In an incident report released
under Washington state's public
records law, firefighters wrote
that they appeared to have Tues-
day's fire under control, but the
flames reignited. Crews found
that water seemed to intensify
the fire, so they began using a dry
chemical extinguisher.
After dismantling the front
end of the vehicle and puncturing
holes in the battery pack, crews
used a circular sawto cut an access
hole in the front section in order to
apply water to the battery, accord-
ing to documents. Only then was
the fire extinguished.
Shares of Tesla Motors Inc. fell
more than 6 percent Wednesday
after an Internet video showed
flames spewing from the vehicle,
which Tesla has touted as the
safest car in America.
CAIRO
Disrespecting flag
in Egypt could
lead to prison
Egypt's interim government
decided Wednesday that insult-
ing the flag and refusing to stand
for the national anthem is an
offense punishable by law.
The decree follows a media
fracas sparked by reports that an
ultraconservative Islamist sit-
ting on a committee to amend the
constitution refused to stand for a
moment of silence honoring police-
men killed on duty during a raid on
a militant stronghold last month.
It recalled earlier controversy
over reports that members of the
ultraconservative Salafi trendhave
refused to stand for the national
anthem for religious reasons.

MOSCOW
Activists charged
with piracy
Greenpeace said Wednesday
that 14 of its activists who were
detained after protesting at a
Russian oil platform have been
charged with piracy, a crime pun-
ishable by up to 15 years in prison.
L The environmental activists
from Argentina, Brazil, Britain,
Finland, the Netherlands, Poland,
Russia and Sweden were among
30 people from 18 countries who
were on board the Greenpeace

Iran's new President Hassan Rouhani waves after swearing in at the parliament, in Tehran, Iran in August. As Iran's
diplomatic profile rises with attempts to recalibrate its dealings with Washington, the Gulf rulers will have to make
adjustments, too, and that's not such an easy thing for the monarchs and sheiks to swallow.
Rouhani savs Iran is open to
iscussing nuclear activities

Iran's new president
has made overtures
to the West to cool
diplomatic tensions
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Presi-
dent Hassan Rouhani said
Wednesday that Iran is open to
discussing "details" of nuclear
activities including the enrich-
ment of uranium, hinting that
the Islamic Republic is willing
to broaden the terms of nego-
tiations with world powers.
He spoke shortly after receiv-
ing support from a wide range
of legislators for his policy of
reaching out to the West.
Rouhani emphasized Teh-
ran's longstanding position that
its fundamental right to enrich
uranium, a key ingredient of
nuclear weapons that Iran says
it needs for peaceful purposes,
is not up for discussion. But his
statement was a veiled hint that
Iran is open to negotiating on
the level of uranium enrichment
as part of a deal in return for
lifting of sanctions.
Rouhani was elected this
summer with the backing of
centrists and reformists, pledg-
ing a new approach to relations
with the West. During a visit to
New York for the U.N. General
Assembly last week, he held a
historic phone conversation
with President Barack Obama,
a gesture aimed at ending
three decades of estrangement
between the two countries.
In his remarks Wednesday
after meeting with the Cabinet,

Rouhani said Iran has drawn
up a "precise plan" to put on the
table at the next round of talks
with the five permanent mem-
bers of the U.N. Security Coun-
cil plus Germany in Geneva later
this month.
"Iran's enrichment right is
not negotiable but we must enter
into talks to see what would the
other side proposes to us about
the details," he said.
Uranium enrichment is a
technology that can be used to
produce nuclear fuel but further
enrichment makes it suitable for
use in nuclear weapons.
The U.S. and its allies fear
that uranium enrichment could
be used in developing a nuclear
weapons capacity. Iran says its
program is peaceful and geared
toward generating electricity
and producing isotopes to treat
cancer patients.
Foreign ministers of Iran and
the six-nation group - the U.S.,
Britain, France, Germany, Rus-
sia and China - met in New York
last week in a first meeting since
Rouhani was elected president
in June. The next round of talks
willbe held Oct.15-16 in Geneva.
Rouhani has reached out to
the West, hoping that his policy
of moderation and easing ten-
sions with the outside world will
lead to a nuclear deal.
Over 230 lawmakers, out of a
total of 290, signed a statement
Tuesday to endorse Rouhani's
policy of detente and interac-
tion, signaling that he enjoys
support from both moderates
and conservatives within the
ruling establishment.
Iran's Supreme Leader Aya-

tollah Ali Khamenei, who has
the final say on all state mat-
ters, has supported a strategy
of "heroic flexibility" in foreign
policy, opening the way for Rou-
hani's outreach.
Rouhani reiterated Iran's
pledge that it's not seeking
nuclear weapons, and that it
will keep its nuclear facilities
open to inspection by the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency,
the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog
group.
"This is our principle: to keep
doors of our nuclear facilities
open to IAEA inspection," he
said. "We have nothing to hide.
Our record is clean and our
hands are open."
Iran is living under U.N.
sanctions as well as tough U.S.-
led oil and banking sanctions
that have slashed oil exports by
half and shut Tehran out of the
international financial system.
Rouhani said he was not
surprised to see Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanya-
hu expressing anger at Iran's
"charm offensive."
Netanyahu on Tuesday called
Rouhani "a wolf in sheep's
clothing" and accused the lead-
er of being "a loyal servant of the
regime" who has done nothing
to stop Iran's nuclear program
since he took office in June.
"Such remarks show that we
are moving in the right direc-
tion," Rouhani said. "When
Israel sees that its sword doesn't
work and that wisdom has pre-
vailed in the world and that
the Iranian people's message of
peace is heard . they definitely
get angry."

Spending, safety,
transporation
among key topics
By FARONE RASHEED
Daily StaffReporter
On Wednesday night, the
League of Women Voters
hosted a second forum featur-
ing Ann Arbor City Council
candidates - this time host-
ing hopefuls from Wards 1
and 2 - to discuss a range of
issues, including city infra-
structure, downtown devel-
opment and transportation.
The event, which comple-
ments Tuesday night's debate
with representatives from
Wards 3 and 5, is in anticipa-
tion of the Ann Arbor City
Council elections on Nov. 5.
In the first round of debates
Wednesday, incumbent Sabra
Briere (D) faced off indepen-
dent candidate Jeff Hayner to
garner votes in Ward 1.
The two first discussed
crosswalk safety, a topic
sparked by the recent automo-
bile incident in which a bicy-
clist was struck at a crosswalk
on Plymouth Road. Hayner
called for increased education
about crosswalk safety backed
by more effective police
enforcement.
"The City Council's respon-
sibility should be to put the
proper amount of money into
educating the public - drivers
and pedestrians and bicyclists
- so we can share the streets
safely," Hayner said.
While Briere agreed thatcthe
issue needed to be dealt with,
she said she wasn't sure how to
proceed, since most of the inci-
dents stem from irresponsible
behavior, rather than unsafe
crosswalk policies.
Hayner addressed city
infrastructure, which he
said was overdue for needed
repairs to old and unsat-
isfactory roads, pipes and
draining systems. Briere
acknowledged these con-
cerns, but pointed to the
complexities and realities in
approaching such issues.
"We could do what people
in the past have advised - and
that is tear up the streets, put
in giant systems to conduct
the storm water quickly away
from the neighborhoods - but
we believe that damages the
river. Everything we do is a
moving picture," she said.
Hayner also supported
an expanded regional-bus-
transit system, as long as the
regional parties would be will-
ing and able to pay theirshares

equally. Briere acknowledged
that there would be a problem
expanding the current system
without also funding it - a
cost decision the community
needs to confront and decide
on together, she said.
In reference to the fund-
ing of the Downtown Devel-
opment Association, Briere
stood by her past position to
put a cap on DDA funding.
Hayner noted the inevitability
of growth, but also acknowl-
edged downtown growth as
a significant concern to the
community.
"I think the downtown is
getting pretty big, and when
I go door-to-door people are
concerned about it," Hayner
said.
Incumbent Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) debated Demo-
crat candidate Kirk Westphal
and Independent candidate
Conrad Brown, an LSA senior
and a member of the newly-
formed Mixed-Use Party.
Lumm expressed a need
to align city spending with
the needs of its citizens by
focusing on basic amenities
and services to the public,
including public safety, fixing
streets, addressing water and
sewage infrastructure, as well
as tackling the pedestrian
ordinance.
"It is all about priorities in
so many ways," Lumm said.
Westphal, a government
consultant and chair of the
City Planning Commission,
identified long-term economic
prosperity, proactive neigh-
borhood engagement and an
better budgeting process as
three focus areas - stress-
ing city revenue, community
awareness and council prior-
ity and efficiency in defining
and explaining the city's
major problems.
"I'm not an advocate or
somebody driving for a single
issue - I'm a data person,"
Westphal said.
Brown, a member of the
newly formed Mixed Use
Party and current University
student, reiterated the party's
most central concerns, includ-
ing infrastructure and urban
sprawl. He also articulated
a need to limit the amount of
tax dollars controlled byelect-
ed officials in the downtown
authority and exercise cau-
tion towards investing public
funds in private interests.
"Growing up in Flint, Mich-
igan has given me a unique
perspective on what govern-
ment and fiscal mismanage-
ment will do to a town as once
vibrant and proud as Flint,"
Brown said.

U.S . and global stocks fall over
fears of protracted gov. shutdown

Concerns linger over
potential sovereign
default if debt ceiling
isn't raised
NEW YORK (AP) - Fear of
a protracted U.S. government
shutdown is making global
investors increasingly nervous.
U.S. and European stock mar-
kets fell Wednesday as investors
and world leaders worried about
the threat to the global econo-
my. Europe's top central banker
called the partial shutdown
"a risk if protracted." Boston's
Federal Reserve Bank presi-
dent cited the budget battle as
a reason the Fed refused to pull
back its economic stimulus last
month, and President Barack
Obama appeared on financial
network CNBC to urge Con-
gress to pass a budget and avoid
derailing the nation's economic
recovery.
After shrugging off the first
day of the shutdown Tuesday,
Wall Street made it clear on the
second day that it was more and
more nervous that the budget
fight could turn into something
worse, a failure to raise the
nation's borrowing limit.
"I'm not going out there and
beating my chest and saying the
world is coming to an end here,"
said Brad McMillan, the Chief
Investment Officer at Common-
wealth Financial, an investment
adviser. "But we face the pos-
sibility for significantly greater
disruptions."
The looming crisis has been
growing for weeks. Republicans

in the House of Representatives
are insisting that Democrats
negotiate over a new health
care law as part of the budget
talks. Senate Democrats, led by
Majority Leader Harry Reid of
Nevada, insist that Republicans
pass a straightforward tempo-
rary funding bill with no strings
attached.
The political gridlock could
prevent the U.S. government
from borrowing more money
to cover its bills and pay back
creditors later this month. The
financial market sees that as a
disastrous move that could send
the U.S. into recession.
On Wednesday, the major
indexes opened sharply
lower, as U.S. lawmak-
ers appearing unwilling to
yield in their entrenched
positions. After Obama
summoned Congressional
leaders to the White House
later in the morning, the
market started to recoup
some of its losses, but the
recovery faded throughout
the afternoon.
"The markets are sending
a loud message to Washing-
ton lawmakers to get their
act together and resolve the
budget crisis," said Peter
Cardillo, chief market econ-
omist at Rockwell Global
Capital.
The Dow Jones industrial
average ended the day down
58.56 points, or 0.4 percent,
at 15,133.14 points. The Stan-
dard & Poor's 500 index fell
1.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to
1,693.87. The Nasdaq com-
posite declined 2.96 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 3,815.02.

Six of 10 industry sectors in
the S&P 500 fell. Declines were
led by the makers of consumer
staples and industrial compa-
nies.
Defense companies, which
rely on government contracts
for a large part of their revenue,
led declines for industrial com-
panies. Raytheon fell $1.73, or
2.2 percent, to $76.08. Lockheed
Martin dropped $2.42, or 1.9
percent, to $125.
Earlier, European Central
Bank head Mario Draghi said
that the partial U.S. government
shutdown was a risk to eco-
nomic recoveries in the U.S. and
globally.

Asking the right questions

Every September, the University of Michi-
gan campus in Ann Arbor comes to life again.
Incoming students from all over the world
arrive eager to embark on their new college
adventures and ready to start their indepen-
dent lives away from home. For many of these
new students, excitement fills them; how-
ever, for many others, stress and anxiety may
also occur.
As the school year quickly picks up pace,
students often find themselves feeling home-
sick and overwhelmed with the academic
rigor at Michigan. They experience difficulty
making friends and stress over how to bal-
ance their new lives. Many students begin
to adapt and readjust, whereas others find
themselves facing depression.
Depression is found worldwide and affects
everyone regardless of gender, age, race or
any other demographics. A 2011 study from
the American Psychological Association
revealed that the rates of depression among
college students are steadily increasing. Fur-
thermore, although it has been found to be
more prevalent in women, according to the
National Institute of Mental Health, more
than 6-million men face depression each year.
Research has also shown that men are
often unable to recognize their own symp-
toms of depression or feel embarrassed by
their depression due to the stigma behind
it. So even though free resources for treat-
ment of depression are available through the
University's Counseling and Psychological
Services, because men are often less aware
of their symptoms (which can vary from
women's symptoms) and feel ashamed about
seeking help, men frequently leave their
depression untreated.
During my freshmen year, a close friend of
mine expressed to me how he felt sadness for
varying reasons, found himself lacking any
motivation, had problems concentrating and
was feeling helpless. I suggested to him that
he speak with someone at CAPS, but he did
not know what CAPS was and was skeptical

as to how the office could help him. More-
over, he felt that his symptoms weren't signif-
icant enough to seek the help of professionals
and he believed that he could simply "handle
it on his own."
The stigma behind depression, the lack of
education regarding depression, and the trans-
parency of resources around campus continue
to affect many students, specifically males.
When depression goes untreated, students
may see a significant drop in their academic
performance, relationships can be strained,
risky behaviors may increase and, at the most
extreme, students may attempt suicide.
As a caring and close-knit community, the
University needs to address this problem.
Similarly to the Sexual Assault Prevention
and Awareness Center on campus, CAPS
should organize and conduct workshops for
each incoming freshmen class. This can be
done through required residential hall meet-
ings at the start of each school year or during
orientation sessions throughout the summer.
The workshops and presentations should
focus on educating students on the causes
and symptoms of depression, as well as the
treatments and free resources available on
campus. They should also divide groups
of students by gender for a portion of the
workshop to address gender-specific issues
regarding depression. Specifically for our
male students, it's important to address the
stigma behind depression in men and the
varying symptoms that men can face.
With CAPS providing our students, specif-
ically our male students, with awareness and
education regarding depression, we hope to
increase our students' academic performance
as well as increase their ability to flourish as
well-rounded individuals graduating from
the University. Equally as important, we
hope to promote healthy physical and mental
lifestyles here in our community.

Work graduate student.

ing and life-threatening diseases,
including Parkinson's disease,
Alzheimer's disease and multiple
sclerosis, Feldman said.
"I know that the potential of
human embryonic stem cells is
really in its infancy," Feldman
said. "As we engage in under-
standing of what stem cells do,
we will really then begin to more
fully understand their complete
potential. I really don't think
we're even at the tip of the ice-
berg."
Although the results from the
trials are still preliminary, Feld-
man said four of 15 patients tested
in Phase I experienced a "stable or
improved disease course." Prior
to human studies, the research
team demonstrated the capability
of this treatment to slow the pro-
gression of symptoms in rats with
the disease.
"Stem cells placed into the spi-
nal cord of these rat models of
ALS caused the large motor neu-
rons to survive," Feldman said.
"And also actually allowed the
rats to have continued function
and not to die as quickly from
their disease. We're very excited
about that."
Prior to 2008, Feldman spent
10 years investigating ALS treat-
ments in California, while stem-

cell research was still illegal in
the state of Michigan. After the
passage of the Michigan Stem
Cell Amendment, which loosened
restrictions on stem-cellresearch,
Feldman moved her research back
to the University and has contin-
ued here ever since.
Although the research - in
particular, embryonic stem-cell
research - is still controversial in
some areas of the country, Feld-
man said the research has the
potential to impact the lives of
people suffering from degenera-
tive diseases.
"I am more pro-life than any-
one because what I do is take
embryos that were previously lit-
erally discarded down a garbage
disposal, and I take those embry-
os and we create new embryonic
stem cell lines," Feldman said.
"And I think you can see today
the hope that these new stem-cell
lines can offer for what are really
fairly devastating diseases."
After studying ALS at the Uni-
versity for almost 25 years, Feld-
man said she is equally interested
in understanding the disease as
well as the treatment. Martin
Fischhoff, managing director of
the Taubman Institute, said this
focus on "translational research"
is important to the future of fed-
erally funded research projects.
"There's been a disconnect
between the research being
done in the laboratories and the
development of new treatments
for patients," Fischhoff said.
"We're doing important research,
but there hasn't been the same
emphasis of bringing them to
patients through new treatments
and new therapies, which is what
we're tryingto do at the Taubman
Institute and I think throughout
the University."
"To do this kind of pioneering
stem cell researchhere at the Uni-
versity of Michigan is something
everybody in the state should be
proud of," he said.

"I definitely fell in love with

ning, but says this week's race
is especially important to him
because he's been working on the
car's design from the beginning.

overturned on an appeal.
"I was devastated, humiliated
and could not let it go," Ledbet-
ter said.
Over the next eight years, Led-
better's case made it to the U.S.
Supreme Court, where the jus-
tices ruled in favor of Goodyear,
saying that she should have filed
a case within 180 days of her first
unequal paycheck, even though
Ledbetter was unaware of the
discrepancy for nearly 20 years..
"I could not let a major corpo-
ration (take advantage of) me and

best for the University, for your-
self, and for everyone else."
While dedication and high rank-
ings may have proven to be staples
of the Solar Car Team, Kauney said
the onethingthathas changed this
year is the car's name.
"Every other car we've
designed has had the letters UM

On average, women make 77
cents to every dollar men earn,
and the discrepancy is even
worse for women of color. Under
the act, more time is allowed for

natory wage practices.

enjoys.
"With everything already

to restructure and rebuild as a
team, which I'm really looking
forward to," O'Brien said. "Now
we'll have time to try out differ-
ent things and reorganize our
workspace, which will be nice."
As an engineer, O'Brien said
the skills he has learned on the
team are very different from
those he learns in the classroom.
"The things we learn at
Solar Car don't reinforce the
things I'm learning in my class-
es because they're different
aspects of engineering, but I like
that it broadens my scope and

LSA senior Brianna Hender-

because she had heard many dif-
ferent perspectives on the Equal
Pay Act and wanted to hear from
Ledbetter herself.
Ledbetter was invited to speak
by the Department of Women's
Studies and the Institute for
Research on Women and Gender
for their annual Vivian R. Shaw
lecture, part of a series highlight-
ing issues affecting women or

resulted in an emergency stop

completely.
"The nicest part about this
year is how there haven't been
any major engineering problems
with the car," O'Brien said.
For O'Brien, Solar Car is more
about being a part of something
big.
"Being a part of our team
means you're a necessary part
of one of the best engineering
projects in the world," he said.
"We're kind of the poster child

Pressure builds for
quick fix to health
exchange issues


(AP) - The pressure is on
for the federal government and
states running their own health
insurance exchanges to get the
systems up and running after
overloaded websites and jammed
phone lines frustrated consum-
ers for a second day as they tried
to sign up for coverage using the
new marketplaces.
In some ways, the delays that
persisted Wednesday were good
news for President Barack Obama
and supporters of his signature
domestic policy achievement
because the holdups showed
what appeared to be exceptional-
ly high interest in the overhauled
insurance system. But if the
glitches aren't fixed quickly, they
could dampen enthusiasm for the
law at the same time Republicans
are using it as a rallying cry to
keep most of the federal govern-
ment closed.
"It was worse today than it
was yesterday," Denise Rathman
of Des Moines said after she tried
for a second day to log onto the
Iowa site.
Rathman has insurance
through Dec. 31 but said she
is eager to sign up for a policy
because of her psoriatic arthri-
tis, which has caused her to be
denied insurance in the past.
David Berge, a pastor with
two young children in Shorev-
iew, Minn., tried unsuccessfully
at least 10 times to create an
online account on the state-run
site MNsure. His high-deductible
plan expires at the end of the year.
"I'm anxious to see what the
insurance is going to look like for
my family at the beginning of the
year," Berge said. "That's a big
unknown right now. I want to fig-
ure that out as soon as possible so
we can begin planning."
In California, home to 15 per-
cent of the nation's uninsured,
officials pulled the enrollment
portion of the Covered California
site down overnight for emergen-
0 cy upgrades. It was restored mid-
morning Wednesday, and 7,770
people had started applications
by then, spokesman Roy Kennedy
said.
California is one of a hand-

ful of mostly Democratic states
that opted to set up their own
exchanges rather than let the fed-
eral government do it for them.
In the 36 states being operated by
the federal Department of Health
and Human Services, consumer
patience was still being tested.
Agency spokeswoman Joanne
Peters said many Americans suc-
cessfully enrolled on the first day,
but she declined to put a number
on it. She said the delays were due
to "overwhelming interest" and
high volume.
It's not as if nobody warned
them. Just three months ago,
the congressional Government
Accountability Office said a
smooth and timely rollout could
not be guaranteed because the
online system was still getting
finishing touches and had not
been fully tested.
The Obama administration
shrugged off the evaluation.
The bumpy debut has the hall-
marks of a technology project
that may have rushed to meet the
Oct. 1 deadline, said Bill Curtis,
chief scientist at CAST, a soft-
ware quality analysis firm, and
director of the Consortium for IT
Software Quality, which develops
standards.
"When you are in a rush, you
typically make a lot of mistakes
and you don't have time to test
them all out," he said.
High volume can also expose
software flaws that were not
detected in testing, Curtis said,
like the recurring problem con-
sumers encountered trying to set
up accounts on the federal site.
Drop-down menus that were sup-
posed to provide security ques-
tions did not work.
The department issued sur-
vival tips for aggravated con-
sumers after 4.7 million unique
visitors logged in to the health-
care.gov website on Tuesday. As
new health insurance markets
went live around the country, the
federal call center also received
190,000 calls.
In suburban Cleveland, Sharon
Schorr finally gave up on the fed-
eral exchange website after eight
hours of failed clicks.

CANDIDATES

tem. However, over the next 10
months,the University Board
of Regents will be tasked with
choosing whether to once again
seek a candidate from outside
the University or turn within the
boundaries of its campuses.
The advisory committee in
charge of short-listing presi-
dential candidates , recently
released a Presidential Profile
detailing their expectations.
In an e-mail interview, Regent
Katherine White (D), the vice
chair of the board and act-
ing spokeswoman during the
search process, wrote that each
candidate, regardless of prior
affiliation with the University,
would bring "something unique
to the equation" and be judged
based on the profile.
"All candidates will be evalu-
ated on their own merit, whether
theyare internal or external," she

wrote in an e-mail interview. "It
is difficult to generalize about
pros and cons based solely on
whether a candidate is internal
or external."
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent for student affairs, said
in a September interview that
some of the internal issues she
believed the upcoming president
would be faced with include
keeping college affordable,
maintaining a balance between
academic and athletic excel-
lence, and improving diversity
and inclusion.
"I don't know if it'll be a chal-
lenge, but we certainly want a
president that understands the
history of this place and the stu-
dents' role in it," Harper said.
Michael Bastedo, an associate
professor of education, said he
believed that an internal presi-
dent had the advantage of need-
ingless time to build connections
within the University.
"I think we can learn that hir-
ing someone externally doesn't

mean they make a bad president,"
Bastedo said. "Even though she
was hired externally, now the
perception of President Coleman
is she's a very Michigan person -
not somebody that wants to just
act autocratically."
By July 2014, the regents'
decision to choose a president
from within the University will
depend on their valuation of lead-
ership qualities. Matt Chingos, a
fellow in the Brookings Institu-
tion's Brown Center on Educa-
tion Policy, said although having
a top University administrator
step up to the presidency would
be a more "natural transition,"
someone from the outside would
be more likely to bring an out-of-
the-box perspective to the insti-
tution.

The solution may be to choose
someone who had held a position
in the University for only a short
period of time, Bellman said.
Coleman said in a September
interview that her experience
serving as a president of the Uni-
versity of Iowa prepared her to
serve the same at another Big Ten
university. It took a few years, she
said, but over time she believed
she was able to learn the ropes of
the University.
"It's like drinking from a fire
hose," Coleman added. "You have
to just learn, learn, learn and lis-
ten intently, but itcan be the most
exhilarating."

'M' hunting for
first win in East
Lansing since '98

Seniors eager to make
good on title pledge

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
After ending the weekend
with its first tie and Big Ten
loss, the Michigan women's soc-
cer team dropped eight spots in
the NSCAA coaches' poll to No.
21. The Wolverines now look
to rebound in East Lansing,
focusing their
efforts on end- Michigan at
ing scoring
droughts that Mich. State
have plagued Matchup:
the team over Michigan 7-7-1;
the last two MSU 7-2-2
weeks. When: Thurs-
"We defi- day 3 p.m.
nitely have Where'
high hopes," DeMartin Soc-
said Michigan cer Complex
coach Greg
Ryan. "We're TV/Radio: rg
determined to
go into Lansing
and try to get a win out of that
game. Last year was our first
win over them in a long time. We
know it's going to be a very, very
tough game, but we're also very
confident that we've got a great
game plan."
Thursday, the Wolverines
(1-1-1 Big Ten, 7-2-1 overall) will
contest their in-state rival Mich-
igan State (1-2, 7-2-2) at the Spar-
tans' DeMartin Soccer Complex
at 3 p.m. Over the weekend, both
teams hosted their first confer-
ence opponents. Michigan had
a winless weekend with a tie.
Meanwhile, Michigan State had
a win against Minnesota (1-2,
8-3) followed by a loss to Wis-
consin (2-0-1, 7-1-2).
The last time Michigan won in
East Lansing was Oct. 16, 1998.
"(Michigan State is) very good
in the counter attack," Ryan
said. "If we give away the ball
in the midfield, they're gonna be
running down our throats very
quickly. That's how they created
numerous chances against Wis-
consin. For us, it's making sure
we're playing the well, keeping

the ball (and) not giving the ball
(up) in our own end because if
we do, they're gonna get great
chances."
The Wolverines played to
their first tie of the season
against the Badgers on Friday
night, followed by their second
loss Sunday against the Gophers.
Michigan's defense played
excellent against both teams. It
kept opponents to the outside
of the field and made it difficult
to cut inside to get a shot oppor-
tunity. Freshman goalie Taylor
Bucklin had a career high seven
saves against Wisconsin, as well
as two more against Minne-
sota. Senior midfielder Meghan
Toohey was also one of the most
productive players of the game,
putting pressure on the oppos-
ing teams' most aggressive play-
ers.
"I think defensively we do
have the right mentality," said
senior defender Shelina Zador-
sky. "Even on attacking players,
we know how to defend well."
Though the defense stood its
ground, the offense was lacklus-
ter. The Wolverines continued to
struggle with their shot accura-
cy, and despite outshooting Min-
nesota 5-3 in shots on goal, they
came up with nothing.
"Well, we've been working
a lot on finishing," Ryan said.
"We've done all sorts of finish-
ing exercises and training, train-
ingunder pressure so it's not just
shooting the ball at the goal with
nobody putting you under pres-
sure."
Added Zadorsky: "We talk
about the mentality that you
need to have in front of the goal.
You need to be able to focus in
the final moments just to get
that quality finish or that quality
final pass."
Meanwhile; Michigan State
pulled off a 3-0 victory against
Minnesota on Friday but was
shut out by the Badgers 2-0 on
Sunday.
Michigan State junior goalie

For The Daily
After comingup justsix points
short of a national championship
in 2012, the sophomores of the
Michigan women's rowing team
pledged that they would bring a
championship back to the Boat-
house before they graduated.
The time to prove that is here.
They had tasted success: a
second-place finish at the NCAA
championship meet in 2012 and a
No. 14 final ranking in 2013. Sec-
ond and 14th overall is nothing
to scoff at, but it doesn't make a
permanent legacy - and that's
what they are now aiming for.
With 17 of the 44 roster spots
belonging to seniors, this year
is the final stand for the class of
2014.
The seniors attribute the slide
to a lack of focus throughout
the squad. With a season begin-
ning in the fall and spanning the
next eight months, it is difficult
to stay focused when there isn't
a race weekend - as is the case

really good about not slacking
off and putting in the work now
so that we have that confidence
on race day to really step up and
preform."
The ratio of seniors to the rest
of the squad can be a double-
edged sward in rowing, where
there are only eight spots on
the top boat. There will be some
seniors who either don't make a
spot on the topboat, or have their
spot taken by an underclassman.
But there is a wealth of experi-
ence and leadership in the lower
boats, where they may end up.
"It brings us together know-
ing that other teammates are
pushing hard for your seat, and
you can never be comfortable,
and that brings you together in
a competitive way," Anderson
said.
One early trial of the seniors'
leadership is how they help
teammates in other boats
improve. At meets, Wolverine
teammates turn into opponents.
The challenge then will be how
to keep a mindset in practice

Senior defender Shelina Zadorsky said the offense must focus on finishing shots.

Courtney Clem also set a career
high in saves with 12 against the
Gophers. Clem is a very sharp
goalie, and it will be difficult for
the Wolverines' attack to get one
past her.
The Spartans' offense has also
proved difficultto defend with 12
different players scoring at least
one goal this season. Michigan
will have to keep an eye on soph-
omore defender Mary Kathryn
Fiebernitz. She headed one into
the net off of a corner kick with
three minutes left in the first half
against Minnesota and leads the
team in scoring with four goals.
Sophomore midfielder Allyson
Krause leads the team with 10
points, coming from three goals
and four assists.
"The main thing to take away
is Michigan State is a very, very
good team," Ryan said. "A key
player for them (is) Allyson
Krause, who plays on top. She's
very good at running in, behind
the back line, very good in the
one-on-one (and very good at)
getting her shot off."
Another thing to look for in
this week's matchup is the phys-
icality that comes with the Big
Ten conference. The Wolverines
saw new levels of intensity with
numerous slide tackles and a
number of moments where play-
ers struggled to recover from

hard hits. This week's competi-
tion should exhibit even more of
this type of brutal play.
"Every single Big Ten game is
going to be a difficult matchup,"
Zadorsky said. "I think this one
especially because there is so
much on the line. There's a lot of
pride and history and we want to
win again just like we were able
to last year."
The last time these teams
played was last October in Ann
Arbor. The game was decided in
the 99th minute when Zadorsky
launched one from the corner
to former Michigan midfielder
Emily Jaffe. Jaffe had only been
in the game for nine minutes,
but she made the most of them
by heading a game-winning goal
past the Spartans' goalkeeper to
lead the team to a 2-1 victory.
Last year's victory was the
Wolverines' first over the Spar-
tans since 2003, which was a
2-1 overtime win. With the 2012
win, Michigan improved its all-
time record over the Spartans to
9-5-7.
Coach Ryan is looking for win
No. 10.
"You go one game at a time,"
Ryan said. "You get ready for
Michigan State. We go after that
one to win just like we went after
(the win against Wisconsin and
Minnesota)."

of us, and I don't think we've
really lived up to that potential
yet," said senior port/starboard
Bryna Oleshansky. "This year we
are ready."
"It's way more intense this
year. Last year there was a lull,
and we weren't reminded all the
time that NCAAs were coming
and that every single day mat-
tered," said senior starboard
Lauren Anderson.
Some teams are cautious not
to look too far into the future -
this isn't one of those teams. As
is evidenced by the countdown
to the national championship
and Big Ten race that is dis-
played vehemently on a board in
the clubhouse. Pounding these
big picture goals into your head
in October gives you motivation
to work as hard as you can. Work
whose results will be seen in
June, when the Wolverines are
staring down a nasty headwind
in a pivotal race, and don't bat an
eye - they are prepared.
To take an extra step toward
reaching full potential, the
senior class created a substan-
tially harder summer and fall
workout schedule than they had
seen in the three prior off-sea-
sons.
By adding a level of off-season
commitment that would rival
any collegiate varsity sport, the
team is hitting the ground run-
ning this fall.
"In the past, our falls have
been used to get back to speed,
taking it nice and slow, being
very technical, but after last sea-
son the seniors decided that if
you're not training over the sum-
mer, you're not going to make a
top boat," Oleshansky said.
Every week the team runs in
the Big House, has early morn-
ing practices four times and
afternoon practices six times. No
piece of cake.
"We work harder than any-
body else, and we are really con-
fident about that," said senior
port/starboard Chrissy Holm.
"Everybody wants to win, obvi-
ously that's why you're in a sport,
but having that confidence is
what could tip the scale from
losing to winning. Our class is

go through,
and they have to go through
a few bad strokes to get to the
good ones, so (how much we sug-
gest to other boats) is a sensitive
boundary," Holm said. "If I come
from a place of 'This is going to
make the team faster' or 'We see
you guys working hard, you guys
will push through' helps more
than 'This is what you should be
doing, listen to me because I'm in
a higher boat."'
With such a large roster, there
are sure to be social disputes
throughout the year - which is
why the Leadership Council was
created in 2012. The council con-
sists of two team members from
each the sophomore, junior, and
senior classes. If two teammates
have a dispute, rather than hav-
ing the coaches deal with the
conflict, a council member will
meet with both parties and lead
them to resolution.
"It's really good," Livings-
ton said. "Last year there was
a little disconnect. The purpose
of it is to bridge the gap between
our team and the coaches. Dur-
ing my freshman year there
would be problems on the team
and they would just fester. They
wouldn't be resolved until the
end of the year, which was just
too late. Now people feel com-
fortable going up to their own
teammate and meet and discuss
the problem and make the neces-
sary adjustments."
Identifying problems from
past years is no easy task, and
fixing them all at once is even
harder - but that's what the
seniors have set out to do. With
a national championship in their
sights, nothing is intimidating
them.
"We have a lot of unfinished
business to take care of," Holm
said. "Seeing Virginia on the
stand being able to do their
cheer when they won the team
title was heart-wrenching.
Being able to top off all of the
hard work that we have done is
going to be a big thing. Really,
(we just want to) put it out there
for Michigan. The school has
given us so much, and it's really
time for us to give back and take
the title."

Bryant in, Miller out
on 'M' offensive line

Graham Glasgow
shifts to center as
Hoke tries to fix
scuffling line
By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
After weeks of deliberation,
the Michigan coaching staff has
opted for a personnel change in
the unit that has caused the foot-
ball team the most strife through
four games - the offensive line.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
announced at his Wednesday
press con- NOTEBOOK
ference that
redshirt soph-
omore GrahamGlasgow will now
be the starting center, replacing
fellow redshirt sophomore Jack
Miller, whose play has been at
the forefront of questions con-
cerning the inexperienced inte-
rior line.
Taking Glasgow's place at the
left guard spot for Saturday's
game against Minnesota will be
redshirt sophomore Chris Bry-
ant. The switch comes a week
after Hoke's comments that he
would only move linemen around
if a suitable replacement at guard
stuck out.
"These guys have all done

a tremendous job competing,"
Hoke said Wednesday. "If we
were going to kick the ball off
today, Graham would be the cen-
ter. Chris Bryant would be the
left guard."
Hoke added that redshirt
junior Joey Burzynski and true
freshman Kyle Bosch are also
possibilities to enter the rotation
come Saturday.
When pressed, Hoke said that
the cause for the moves was "just
competition. Simple. Competi-
tion at both positions."
"Chris has been close all year,
to be honest with you," he said.
"His knee became a problem for
three or four days, then he had
a little nick in the shoulder - a
boo boo. He's come through that
pretty well."
Last season, Bryant battled a
fractured leg that kept him out
for the entire season.
Hoke also noted that the
team's biggest obstacle to a suc-
cessful offensive line thus far
hasn't only been the center posi-
tion, but rather finding the five
players who will do the best job
together.
During the Brady Hoke Radio
Show on Wednesday night,
broadcast on the Michigan IMG
Sports Network, Hoke said the
difference between this year's
offensive line and that of previ-
ous seasons is the increased com-

petition.
RYAN REPORT: Redshirt
junior linebacker Jake Ryan,
who has been recovering from a
spring anterior cruciate ligament
tear, is participating in full con-
tact team activities, according to
Hoke.
"We're smart with him,
though," Hoke said.
Hoke said his star defensive
player will be back "hopefully
soon," adding "he's doing a lot
more every day." October has
been the target month for Ryan's
return since fall camp.
TEXT SPEAK: Consider-
ing how much redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner
has struggled through the first
month of the season, it's no sur-
prise that offensive coordina-
tor Al Borges has been spending
extra time with Gardner, trying
to work out the kinks.
As it turns out, Gardner has
been texting regularly with his
57-year-old coach, especially
since the Connecticut game,
when Gardner turned the ball
over three times in the 24-21 win.
Film study is when Gardner
and Borges have been communi-
cating electronically the most.
"When I see something the
other team is vulnerable in, I just
text him ... that we may be able to
exploit the weaknesses," Gard-
ner said Wednesday.

Like Robinson, Gardner
responds to his critics

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
Devin Gardner likes to call.
himself a "student of the game."
He watches extra film. He takes
time to learn the playbook. He
wants to make sure there are no
surprises.
But his studies extend beyond
the football field, too. Over the
past few weeks, Gardner has
come back to something he
learned in a psychology class.
"You need 10,000 hours to
get out of a habit," Gardner said.
"When you get into the heat of
the moment, you can revert back
to the old ways of doing things."
Did Gardner put in the full
10,000 hours necessary over the
past two weeks to kick his turn-
over tendency?,
Not quite.
Nevertheless, he feels confi-
dent saying that his eight turn-
overs over the course of four
games are more of the anomaly
than the rule.
Whether or not that is the
case once Big Ten play starts this
weekend remains to be seen. But
even if Gardner hasn't been able
to completely solve the intercep-
tion problem, at least he's getting

better at brushing it off after-
ward.-
By now, the Wolverines have
a routine for when interceptions
happen: fifth-year senior wide
receiver Jeremy Gallon simply
pats Gardner on the helmet, and
the offensive line tries to provide
as many encouraging words as
they can.
Gardner is all too aware of his
errors, and though he'll always
exchange a few words with Hoke
when he comes off the field, he
prefers to just "chill out and
think about what happened."
Gardner may be learning how
to cope with major criticism for
the first time in his career, but
Hoke's been through this before
- former Michigan quarter-
back Denard Robinson threw 12
interceptions during his senior
season, and often came under a
storm of criticism for his diffi-
culties throwing the ball.
Before Gardner was the one
throwing the picks, he was the
one on the sidelines consoling
Robinson as he came off the field.
Now Gardner's the one answer-
ing for his actions.
Gardner hasn't reached out to
Robinson for advice on how to
handle the criticism - according

to Gardner, he doesn't want to
bother Robinson, who is busy in
his current role as a wide receiv-
er for the Jacksonville Jaguars.
But Gardner learned a lot from
his predecessor, who was known
for his quieter demeanor and
actions-instead-of-words atti-
tude.
"That was beneficial for me
because I could see how much
it couldn't bother (Robinson),"
Gardner said. "I've probably
thought about the way he han-
dled things in general as the
quarterback. He was an example
of how to behave and how you
should act."
The Wolverines are quick to
defend Gardner from criticism,
and the coaches are too - as
Hoke continuously reminds the
media, the only noise he wants
his players to listen to is the kind
that comes from their teammates
and coaches.
Even so, Gardner smiled when
he acknowledged that he does
deserve some of the backlash
that's come his way in recent
weeks.
"When you play as bad as I've
played, you've kind of earned
that," Gardner said. "I just can't
wait to play on Saturday."

Redshirt sophomore Graham Glasgow will switch from left guard to center, replacing redshlrt sophomore Jack

Joe Maher gives Michigan coaching an edge on the ice

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
The No. 10 Michigan hockey
team has itself a brand-new
strength and conditioning coach.
And he has himself a pair of
shiny, new skates.
Joe Maher comes to the pro-
gram highly touted from his.
former employer - the 2012-13
national championship-winning
Yale men's hockey team. At Yale,
Maher's conditioning responsi-
bilities also included the wom-
en's ice hockey, track and field,
baseball, field hockey and crew
teams.
In addition to a Frozen Four
win, Maher aided in the success-
es of several programs - namely
four consecutive rowing national
championships between 2007
and 2010 - in six years with the
Bulldogs, while earning a bronze
medal at the international level
for the junior U.S. hockey team
in 2011.
A former hockey player at
Rhode Island, Maher is the first
strength and conditioning coach
in 30 years under Michigan
coach Red Berenson with prior
experience on the ice - an asset
that should prove invaluable this
season.
The ability to train both in the
gym and on the ice gives Maher
an edge over most strength and
conditioning coaches in the
nation. But for the time being,
Maher is the new guy with the
challenge of pitching a new style
to this team's seasoned veterans.
"For the most part, there's still
that trust factor, that feeling-out

I think he'll be a good fit here."
For the Wolverines, the 2013-
14 season begins with the bitter
aftertaste of last year, when a
team many expected to contend
for a 10th national title missed
out on its first NCAA Tourna-
ment appearance in 22 years.
Senior defenseman and cap-
tain Mac Bennett and sophomore
forward and alternate captain
Andrew Copp have since placed
partial blame for the demise on
a lack of team chemistry and

focus.
"We're just kind of desper-
ate," Copp said. "I think all of the
returning guys have amped up
their summers because of what
happened last year.
"Getting a full-time guy like
Joe has been awesome. Coming
on the ice is something (former
strength and conditioning coach
Jim Plocki) couldn't do. He
brings a new attitude."
Tuesday, Maher took charge
of the final 30 minutes of prac-
tice.
He began with a 10-minute
speed skate in which everyone
from forwards to fully-padded
goalies - who often tripped over
themselves - were forced to
change pace with each whistle
blow. The team then ran a cone
drill that forced several players
to double over.
In it, a pair of skaters weaved
around cones, touching the blue
line before slicing in toward cen-
ter ice several times on the width
of the rink.
In a brief moment between
sets, it became clear that Maher
isn't at Michigan to play games.
"He is kicking our butts, but in
a good way," Bennett said. "He
just said, 'Get these guys going.
We're not doing things fast
enough.' We need it. He's a guy
who demands respect. I think
just the fact that he can skate
and he's played before, everyone
respects him for that. He knows
what he's doing, so whatever he
wants to do, we'll do."

new guy coming in so I don't
expect everything to run the way
I want it to run because I have to
earn that respect and that trust.
I expect more of that to come in
the long run."
Until the exhibition opener
against Waterloo, Ont. on Sun-
day, NCAA regulations prevent
coaches from spending more

than two hours a week on the ice
with the team. Maher, though,
is allowed full.access to on-ice
practices in the weeks leading up
to the regular season.
And though it remains to be
seen if Maher will have full juris-
diction over on-ice conditioning
throughout the regular season,
an extra set of hockey-trained
eyes will be an advantage should

assistant coaches like goalie
coach Josh Blackburn - who
is currently enrolled in gradu-
ate courses at Michigan - miss
practices.
"Once I get the confidence
that he's got the feel for what our
team needs, we'll see," Beren-
son said. "I can tell you he had
an impact on that Yale team last
year, according to their coaches.

Offense finally snaps
long scoring drought

By MAX BULTMAN
For theDaily
After a 245-minute scoreless
droughtthat spanned nearly three
games, the Michigan men's soc-
cer team finally broke through
less than a minute into the second
half Wednesday against Western
Michigan.
The last;goal scored by the Wol-
verines, a golden goal five min-
utes into overtime two weeks ago
against West Virginia, was falling
further and further from memo-
ry. But Michigan redshirt junior
midfielder Tyler Arnone fired a
shot into the bottom left corner
from just outside the 18-yard box
on the right wing. The goal not
only ended the drought for the
team, but it also started an offen-
sive explosion in the second half
for the Wolverines, who piled on
three goals from 21 second-half
shots to beat Western Michigan,
3-1.
The 21-shot eruption was a far
cry from the two Michigan mus-
tered in the first half, which came
as a bit of a surprise coming off a
very strong showing just a few
days ago against No. 7 Northwest-
ern. One reason for the slow start
was the absence of senior mid-
fielder Dylan Mencia, who missed
the game with an ankle injury.
"I thought Dylan was our best
guy against Northwestern," said
Michigan coach Chaka Daley. "We
missed his presence, his competi-
tiveness, his leadership. Hopefully
we can nurse him back to health
quickly."
Replacing Mencia at midfield
was senior Fabio Pereira, who
dropped back from forward to fill
the spot, while senior T.J. Roehn
got the starting nod at forward.
Junior TJ VanSlooten, Michi-
gan's leading scorer this season,
came off the bench and assisted
the drought-breaking goal to start
the second half.
"We had a good combination
play up the field, the ball popped
out to me and I looked toward the
top of the 18-yard box to Tyler and
he slammed it home," VanSlooten
said "I started out the season well,
and then went through a bit of a
slump. It felt really nice to get on

the statsheet tonight."
The whole team has been off
the statsheetlately,so it was a wel-
come change when it fired 10 of its
21 second-half shots at Western
Michigan sophomore goalkeeper
Chase Rau.
Daley credits the second-half
breakthrough to a change in men-
tality.
"Just to kind of focus in," he
said. "Where we are in our season,
we still have a ton to play for."
If the Wolverines can continue
to get contributions from players
like Arnone, who netted his first
goal of the season tonight, they
may be able to put all the talk of
their offensive struggles to rest.
In fact, none of Michigan's goal
scorers tonight had scored prior
to the game. Along with Arnone,
senior forward Malcolm Miller
and junior midfielder Marcos
Ugarte got their first tallies of the
year.
"We talked a lot about being
relentless," Arnone said "Usu-
ally it's a lot about tactics, but
today it wasn't about tactics, it
was about work ethic and having
pride. Today, he kind of fired us up
instead of going over tactics."
Daley, though, said that he
gave his team "just a few words"
between halves.
Whatever he said, it worked, as
the Wolverines looked like a dif-
ferent team afterthe break.
"I don't know if we were partic-
ularly flat, but we weren't as good
as we were in the second half,"
Daley said.
"I think in the second half we
demonstrated a little bit of North-
western...with goals," he contin-
ued, referencing the Wolverines'
failure to capitalize against the
Wildcats despite an impressive
showing.
Michigan (0-1 Big Ten, 3-3-3
overall) will look to replicate
its level of play from the second
half on Sunday, when it travels to
Columbus to take on Ohio State in
a game Daley described as "not a
difficult one to get motivated for."
VanSlooten certainly seems up
tothe challenge.
"Come Ohio State, you'd better
believe we'llbe ready forthatone,"
he said.

A tale of two halves in win
over Western Michiga

By MINH DOAN
For the Daily
The men's soccer team took a
break from its Big Ten schedule
as Western
Michigan WMICHIGAN 1
(3-6-0) MICHIGAN 3
traveled
across the state to take on the
Wolverines. But Michigan also
seemed to take a break from the
first half of the game. It took a
lifeless first 45 minutes before
the Wolverines rallied with
three second-half goals en route
to their 3-1 win.
Any progress that the Wolver-
ines made during their previous
game against Northwestern on
Saitrday, when they dominated
possession, was stunted in the
first half as Michigan was out-
hustled by the Broncos. Mainly,
the Wolverines lacked passion
and energy ina very listless first
half. Michigan seemed to not
have the final pass to goal and
had little offensive production
because of it, exemplified by its
two shots, both off target.
"(The halftime talk was)
about work ethic and having
pride," said redshirt junior mid-
fielder Tyler Arnone. "A con-
versation you don't really want
to have because it's expected at
Michigan."
Western Michigan, on the

other hand, showed more life in
the first half as defender Connor
Furgason scored his first goal of
the season to the delight of the
large Western Michigan crowd
on hand for the game. The ball
was whipped in on a free kick
by midfielder-Edu Jimenez and
Furgason beat his defender and
struck a vicious header that hit
the bottom of the crossbar. The
shot was just out of reach of red-
shirt junior goalie Adam Grin-
wis before crossingthe goal line.
"We weren't as sharp as we

in the locker room," Arnone
said. "For me, I wanted to instill
some positive energy."
The Wolverines continued to
press and rattled off three more
shots in the next two minutes
before the Broncos could even
get down the field.
. Redshirt junior midfielder'
Colin McAtee received an assist
in the 65th minute when he
weaved his way past two Bronco
defenders on the goal line before

"I thought Marcos did very

Overall, Michigan played a
better second half and outshot
the Broncos 21-5 in the frame.
The hustle and energy, missing
in the first half, was evident.
The game served as a good
reminder for the Wolverines
that they have to play a complete
game if they want to do well the
second half of the season. How-
ever, the offensive outbreak does
give Michigan some confidence
as it heads into its first road Big

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Michigan adds four-star
forward Kameron Chatman

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan basketball
team's run to last year's Nation-
al Championship game was
supposed to solidify the Wol-
verines on an entrenched posi-
tion amongst the elites on the
national recruiting trail.
But despite continually find-
ing itself in serious contention
for several top prospects in the
2014 recruiting class - players
set to come to campus next year
- Michigan repeatedly found
out that like the title game, com-
ing up close doesn't quite cut it.
Finally, the commitment
drought ended Tuesday night,
when the Wolverines secured
a verbal pledge from four-star

VERBAL COMMITS

-Kameron Chatman, SF

-Austin Hatch, SF

forward Kameron Chatman -
their first since three weeks
before appearing in Atlanta.
Chatman, aversatile, 6-foot-7
wingman, is a consensus top-30
player in the nation. The Port-
land, Ore. native is regarded as

a tremendous rebounder for his
size and position, something
Michigan will certainly ben-
efit from, especially if the team
loses its starting wing, sopho-
more forward Glenn Robinson
III, to the NBA Draft following
the season.
Chatman joins three-star
center Ricky Doyle in the Wol-
verines' current haul, which
hopes to capitalize on the
newfound momentum. Michi-
gan is looking to compliment
the incoming frontcourt play-
ers with a prolific shooter out
of the backcourt. The team is
currently in the mix for shoot-
ing guards Devin Booker and
James Blackmon Jr. - a former
Indiana commitment that took
an official visit to Ann Arbor

last weekend. Booker, who
many analysts believe is leaning
towards attending Kentucky,
is planning to make his own
official visit to Michigan for

-side

5:30 p.m. Beneath a gray
September sky, kissed by rays
of a waning sunset, a few shut-
tered windows framed with
stone arches stare down from
the white faade of the old Jam
Handy building on Detroit's East
Grand Boulevard. Above the
arches, on a blue sign with faded
lettering, read the words, "The
Jam Handy Organization," tes-
tament to a bygone era when this
neighborhood housed an adver-
tising studio that owned many
of the buildings on the street,
employing between 500 and 600
people - General Motors its big-
gest client.
Down the block, in an aban-
doned gas station with graffi-
ti-stained pumps, weeds and
grass spring from cracks in
the pavement - a scene of ter-
rible beauty. A black cat wan-
ders the street, pausing briefly
and staring at its own tail, as
though curious or bored. A
man emerges from a nearby
home, taking out his trash. He
calls to the cat. "Where you
going?" he asks. "Huh? What
you doing?" A moment passes.
He laughs, shakes his head, and
then swings his trash bag into
the bin, before crouching low
on his front steps and lighting a
cigarette.
But inside the old Jam Handy,
the pace of life moves faster
this Sunday evening. Volun-
teers dash about the cavernous
warehouse, making last-minute
adjustments for the evening's
upcoming event that will tem-
porarily transform the space
into a hub of creativity: Detroit
SOUP, a monthly dinner that
uses money given by attend-
ees at the door to fund micro-
grants for community projects
seeking to improve Detroit.
For $5, anyone can attend
the dinner - which consists of
donated soup and salad - and
listen to four different present-
ers discuss their plans to better
the city. At night's end, diners
vote on which project to donate
the night's proceeds to. Projects
can range from a recycling edu-
cation program to a non-profit
dedicated to assisting relatives
of prisoners.
-' "Detroit SOUP reaches those
people you don't read about in
the news," said Kristen Selle,
whose MACC Lit literacy and
tutoring clinic won the August
2013 SOUP dinner. "It's grass-
roots. It's small and it's on a
very personal level."
Slowly, people arrive. Some
park cars in the gas station,
haphazardly filling up unused
space. Others arrive by bicycle
or by foot, gravitating toward
the entrance of the old Jam
Handy. Upon entering, smiles
and laughs are exchanged and
money is deposited in a large

steel pot.
In the room, people min-
gle. There's an excited buzz
to the atmosphere. Twenty-
somethings newly relocated to
Detroit for City Year swap sto-
ries with local residents about
urban farming initiatives and
entrepreneurial opportunities.
An iPhone playlist transitions
from Miles Davis's "So What" to
Outkast's "So Fresh, So Glean."
Next to the entrance, pinned
to the beige wall, paint peeling
from its surface, are handwrit-
ten signs advertising brands of
beer being served at the bar:
Pabst Blue Ribbon, Stroh's,
Miller High Life, Busch. The
beer is free, but $2 donations
are recommended. Eventually,
some people take their seats in
foldable chairs at long rectan-
gular tables, while others opt
for floor seating at tables assem-
bled from pieces of plywood,
covered with black tablecloths
and stacked on crates. On each
table rest two loaves of bread
and a candle.
Inspired by Sunday Soup, a
meal-based micro-grant dinner
started in Chicago in 2007 by
the arts research group InCU-
BATE, Detroit SOUP is but one
iteration of the Sunday-Soup
model. Similar micro-funding
projects have emerged in more
than 60 cities around the world.
In 2010, visual artist Kate
Daughdrill and Detroit musi-
cian Jessica Hernandez brought
SOUP to Detroit, holding the
first dinner above the Mexican-
town Bakery on a snowy Super
Bowl Sunday, with fewer than
40 artists. On that day, nobody
shared proposals. The goal was
simply to explore what SOUP
could be and what it could
become.
Since then, the event has
expanded and grown. It has
changed locations twice, find-
ing its current home at the old
Jam Handy. The types of pro-
posals receiving funding have
shifted from art to community-
based projects, often with a cre-
ative bent.
And with recent grants from
the Knight Foundation, United
Way of America and the Brooks
Family Foundation, SOUP
has begun neighborhood din-
ners based on the same model,
allowing Detroiters to give back
to Detroiters on a more regu-
lar basis, giving each other the
cash they need to spur their
ideas onward. To date, after 50
Detroit SOUP dinners, $50,674
has been distributed in micro-
grants.
"It's becoming a little bit
more formal, and it's becoming
a lot more rooted in the com-
munity," said Amy Kaherl, the
program's director.

Breaking Bad,' not
boundaries

'Breaking' virgin
recaps 'Felina'

Those who read The
New Inquiry's repost of
the 2012 essay "Wafter
White Supremacy" during that
anxious week-long wait before
the "Break-
ing Bad"
finale, may
have, like me,
realized that
their ability
to identify
systems of
oppression JOHN
at work was BOHN
more poorly
cultivated
than they thought. Upon reading
that article, I began to wonder
what value a show like "Break-
ing Bad" has for a community.
Becoming emotionally invested
in a product of popular culture
is a vulnerable position to be in.
It brings people together, but
around what? Around whom?
Of course, feel free to challenge
the articles claims - after you've
read it. Malcolm Harris, the
author, encourages usto employ
a critical lens to popular culture
that can "pay attention to our
attention, to look athow it's being
held, on what, and how someone's
making money on it." And many
people are making money off of
"Breaking Bad" - ahell of a lot
of money off of it. The Huffing-
ton Post reported that AMC sold
30-second ad space for upwards of
$400,000 during the finale. And
companies paid.
This is a show about a meth
kingpin. Why would any brand
be interested in associating them-
selves withsuch sport? As Har-
ris argues, "Breaking Bad" has
essentially whitewashed the drug
economy and made it palatable
for companies like Chrysler who
defend their product placement in
the show as "the right fit in terms
of the plot line and the character."
Harris emphasizes the fact that
the drug economywouldn't oper-
ate aswe see it in "Breaking Bad."
The notion of "paying more for a
better product" is a more familiar
practice of middle-class consumer
ethicsthan the reality of profit-
through-dilution in the drug
trade. And in a scenario where
that sort of trust and collaboration
between producer and distributer
doesn't operate, Walter and Jesse
would need to work closer with
the actual meth users to make
sure the product's purity and

By MAX RADWIN
Daily Fine Arts Editor
No, I don't watch "Break-
ing Bad." Yes, I've heard that's
it's amazing. No, I haven't "tried
watchinga couple of episodes."
That is, untl recently, when I sat
through my first-ever hour of what
many consider to be one of the best
shows in the history of TV. It also
happened to be the series finale,
and what resulted is probably the
most thoroughly ignorant recap of
"Breaking Bad" out there. But, hey
- maybe I offered a fresh take on
the whole thing? Who knows.
Before diving into the recap,
I have to admit - I'm not a total
"Breaking Bad" virgin. It's inevi-
table that I would have picked up
on a fewthingsabout the showhere
and there just by stepping outof my
front door. So before we start, this
muchI do know:
"Malcolm in the Middle" 's dad
- a.k.a. Walter White - has some
form of cancer, and to pay for his
chemo he sells drugs using the
vast knowledge of science that also
qualifies him to teach high school
chemistry.
How does a high school teacher
know that much about drug mak-
ing? I'm not sure. Why didn't this
dude just get health insurance in
the first place?Who the hell knows.
Will I finally understand why my
friend's cover photo says, "Call
Saul"? Let's hope so.
All right, here we go:
We start in a car covered in snow,
I'm guessing in Alaska or Canada
or maybe just Wisconsin in May.
Walter White doesn't look too hot.
He hasscancer, right?So that's prob-
ably why. He's not bald though.
I thought he was supposed to be
bald?
In the car, he searches around
for something but it turns out to be
just his keys, whichwas aletdown.
I thought it was going to be meth
or crack or a gun. Does Walter
White do drugs and have cancer?
What a gangsta.
Then it transitions to Walter
driving in some hot, open desert.
I'm going to say Texas or maybe
Mexico. Either way, that was quite
a change in seasons. He must have
covered some ground.
Walter gets some gas and
messes around with some pill
bottles (drugs? I hope it's drugs).
He calls some woman at the New
York Times and pretends to be
David Lynn asking about a phone
interview with someone named
Schwartz, who I'm guessing is
Walter's arch-nemesis that he is
tracking down to kill/steal backhis
woman/overthrow for the drug
empire.
Nope. I think Schwartz is just
this dopey looking guy in the
next scene complaining about
Thai food. No way is this Walter's
enemy. I miss the guy's name -
let's just call him Wonderbread
- but the woman's name I think
is Gretchen. Regardless, both of
them are boring, rich and white
as shit. Kind of rooting for them
to die.
Which looks probable at first,
because Walter just lets himself

into their house - Wonderbread's
wife nearly pisses herself when
she sees him standing there in
the kitchen. But unfortunately he
doesn't kill them. Instead, he just
gives them $9 million. Whatevs.
Oh shit, but then to make sure
they don't squeal on him he hires
two hit men to follow Mr. and Mrs.
Wonderbread 24/7, which Walter
demonstrates by having the snip-
ers put their red dots on the cou-
ple's chests. Does Walter White
have an ARMY now? How much
power does this dude possibly have
just from selling some drugs on the
side?
Psych, they tricked me again.
It's two goons in the bushes with
laser pointers. And one of them is
hilarious. He must be expressing
the whole philosophical dilemma
of the entire series. He asks Walter
if what they're doing is wrong -
"For real yo. Like morality-wise."
Best character yet. Brilliant.
Walter talks with these two
guys about someone selling "Blue
Meth." The morality-conscious
guy says, "That shit is choice, yo"
- so you know it's the real deal.
Apparently it's Jesse that's "cook-
ing" this Blue Meth and Walter
isn't so happy about it. Ok, so Jesse
= Bad. Let's go with that for now.
Then it switches tosaguy (maybe
Jesse?) polishing a surfboard or
building something from Ikea. Not
really sure.
Flash to Walter sitting in a diner
eating bacon. WHAT WAS THE
POINT OF THAT?!?
"Random Malcolm in the Mid-
dle" Flashback where Walter is
wearing a sweater.
Shit, this show is all over the
place. It's hard to follow, even with
commercials every five minutes.
The next scene is super confusing:
Two people are seemingly on
the most awkward date in the his-
tory of television. The ginger guy
talks about the woman's blouse
and she's like, "What are you even
saying to me right now?" Walter
interrupts them, thank God. At
first I can't tell if he knows them or
if he's going to take them hostage
or something. But then he starts
talking about meth - so yeah,
Walter definitely knows them. He
makes a business proposal to them
but they aren't buying what he's
selling, so he lets them continue on
with their awkward-as-shit-date.
The blonde is Skyler, I think.
She gets a call from a pasty bru-
nette about Walter "being back."

Seriously, she is so pasty. And she
makes it sound like Walter is a ter-
rorist. Is he going to blow some-
thing up? That's what she makes
it sound like, damn. That's, like, a
whole different level. Wait, Walter
was with Skyler during that whole
phone call. Skyler = Wife.
Walter says goodbye to his
infant son (or daughter?), but then
there's a kid on crutches that he
creeps on who might also be his
son. Not sure. Kind of touching,
though.
Now Walter is at like a garbage
dump ora construction site of some
kind that is secretly a drug factory/
gang headquarters. There's lots of
drama with the trashy ponytailed
guy in the purple sweater. Walt
makes his offer again, butponytail
isn't having it.
Ponytail = Uncle Jack? I think I
heard that right.
So then they're takingWalter out
back to kill him and they STOP so
Uncle Jack can talk some smack.
Why do bad guys talk so much
shit RIGHT BEFORE THEY'RE
GOING TO WIN? Seriously, you
could have shot Walter right then,
Uncle Jack. Right. Then.
Instead he brings in some guy in
chains, like a drug-prisoner-slave
guy (do they even do that in real
life? Is that a thing?) and (finally!) it
turns out to be Jesse.
This next part gets alittle banan-
as: A machine gun thing pops out of
Walter's trunk and shoots every-
body. Walter grabs Jesse at the last
second, but everyone else is mowed
the fuck down. I guessothat was the
most efficient way for the writers to
tie up loose ends.
So Jesse is free, and decides to
not shoot Walter (why was that
even a debate? Walter just saved
him after all). And then Jesse just
drives away, laughing like a crazy
person.
Walter's like, "Oh shit I got
a ricochet bullet to the gut I'm
gonna die." So he goes over to
the meth-making area and holds
his gas mask lovingly and pats
the meth-making equipment
with a nostalgic grin on his
face like, "It's been a good ride,
old friend." Didn't realize drug
dealers had so many feels. The
cops roll up but good-'ol-Wally
is already long dead by then.
Damn. Heavy shit.
The show's pretty good,
though, from what I saw. Might
have to watch it from the pilot,
even if I did just ruin it for myself.

Where have all the
femcees gone?

Detroit-based art gallery provides space and options for up-and-coming artists in the area.
" "
City Drift backs
Detroit'satist

Art gallery builds
bridges between
public, creators
By OMAR MAHMOOD
Daily Arts Writer
A few weeks after the news
broke that Detroit was finally
declaring bankruptcy, around
the time former mayoral can-
didate Mike Duggan was mak-
ing gains despite being taken
off the ballot, my dad and I set
out with an old friend to scout
the lots that lay decrepit in the
shadows of grand skyscrapers. It
seemed everyone wanted a piece
of Detroit now, with the public
auctions nearing. What drew
my dad's friend to the streets, to
Cass Corridor and Grand River,
was art. He was a long-time
oncologist-turned-muralist,
scouting for his own gallery in
midtown.
Jennifer Junkenheimer, a
curator hailing from New York,
works in contemporary art and
has partnered with City Drift
which, according to its website,
is an enterprise and worldwide
project that resurrects non-
traditional art of the city under
the "umbrella of the derive,"
that has now turned its eyes on
Detroit.
"I don't call myself an artist,
really. I'm a curator. So my job is
to ... bridge gaps between artists
and the public," Junkheimer
said.
She took the job with a calm
sureness, treading carefully
away from sensationalism. I
had been to the City Drift gal-
lery that weekend. It was on a
broken-down corner, a forlorn
brick building that used to be
a bank. A few paces down the
street arched a rusting bridge
emblazoned "Welcome to
Detroit," in an almost satirical
beauty, when only across the

wiry playground fence was an
old car warehouse overgrown
with weeds and shattered wind-
shields.
There was an inextricable
connection between City Drift
and the auto industry. Maybe it
was the murals of Diego Rivera
that, as far away as they were
on the courtyard walls of the
Detroit Institute of Art, seemed
to watch over the pieces. And
the pieces themselves spoke of
cars. One was a mountain of old
tires, all identical.
Another, called "Bumper
Cars," featured a string of old
car grills and bumpers, with
Chrysler, Dodge, Ford and
GMC still emblazoned, welded
stubbornly onto their frames.
Yet another was a sledgeham-
mer strung onto a windshield
which the viewer was sup-
posed to smash apart. The wall
opposite was lined with carved
metal shapes, beautifully woven
scraps and manifestos from
unions and protestors were
written in simple little notes
under each one.
When asked what she made
of the heavy auto motif, Junken-
heimer thoughtfully explained:
"It's probably not because the
culture of the city is so much
about cars or anything. If you
look around Detroit, a lot of
the empty businesses had to do
with cars, so that's what the art-
ists have to work with now."
As a part of the art commu-
nity, her job was not to worry
about trends and to name things.
It was clear, though, that some-
thing was up-and-coming. She
talked of her friend Thomas Bell,
the man behind Bumper Cars.
The artist and his partner had
moved to Detroit, of all places,
from New York, of all places.
Why?
"New York is just so expen-
sive. ... And artists tend to come
from lower economic status,
so you know, when New York

got unbearable they just kicked
out anyone who couldn't pay,"
Junkenheimer said.
It seemed that Thomas Bell
had found a living in Detroit. He
had his own gallery, for once.
And he wasn't the only one.
That's how you know when the
city is on the up: when the artists
start moving in.
Junkenheimer insisted that
artists have found a new home in
Detroit. "Although I don't live in
Detroit, for the record," she clar-
ified. She was part of the Detroit
arts circle, but a new voice and
one removed as well, because
her partner was a professor
at the Stamps School of Art &
Design here.
She emphasized the need to
change an attitude: "Detroit for
us can't just be a Tigers game,"
she said.
When she takes students out to
see sites, they come upon places
that are nice, that are glossy,
places that you'd never expect to
see in Detroit. She talked about
one recent project of hers where
she took viewers out to a Finnish
sauna at 2 a.m. Everything about
the project seemed to be about
subverting stereotypes about
Detroit. A Finnish sauna, right in
someone's backward. In Detroit.
Take Adil, our oncologist-
turned-muralist. He hails from
the suburbs and has spent his
career as an oncologist. His art
has long been a basement mat-
ter, but now he's moved out into
the open and has found that
Detroit is asking for something
more. City Drift itself shows
off pictures of the doctor paint-
ing Urdu poetry on the "Wall
of Freedom," next to bubbled
graffiti native only to Detroit -
prayer of the mother, read the
blue letters, air of heaven.
"Detroit is gritty; Detroit is
tough, " Junkenheimer said. "If
someone were to ask me where
to go for art, I wouldn't say Ann
Arbor. I would say Detroit."

T he first verse on the
introduction to Snoop
Dogg's landmark debut
album Doggystyle is aggressive,
witty and rapped with force.
Here's an
excerpt:
"Never
will there
ever be
another like -
me / You can
play the left,
cuz it ain't JACKSON
no right in HOWARD
me / out the
picture, out
the frame, out the box I knock
em all / Smack em out the park,
like a friendly game of baseball
/ Grand, slam, yes I am / Kickin
up dust and I don't give a god-
damn!"
Do you know who rapped
that? It wasn't Snoop, Dr. Dre,
Daz, Kurupt or Warren G.
Instead, it was a rapper by the
name of Lady of Rage who, in
the early 1990s, was considered
such an incredible lyricist that
she - not Snoop himself - was
given the honor of rapping
the album's first verse. There
once was a time when female
emcees (femcees) were not only
given the same respect as their
male counterparts, but actually
achieved similar levels of com-
mercial success.
Today, however, the story
couldn't be more different.
Since 2005, only one female
rapper has attained as much
success and acclaim as her male
contemporaries: Nicki Minaj.
Every other female rapper of
the past 20 years has either
stopped recording or faded into
oblivion. What happened to the
female emcee? Why, since the
early 2000s, have female rap-
pers been on the steady decline,
both in numbers and in record
sales? And, last but maybe most
intriguing, why does it seem
like the American public has
lost interest in female rappers?
There is no definitive answer.
However, if we look back at the
history of femcees, some clues
emerge.
Between 1988 and 1989,
Queen Latifah, MC Lyte and
Roxanne Shantd exploded onto
the scene with three classic
debut albums. These rappers
relied on their lyrics - not
their bodies - for success, and
preached predominately femi-
nist messages in their songs,
highlighted by Latifah's classic
"Ladies First."
The 1990s, though, were the
real height for female rappers.
Almost every hip-hop label
or crew during the decade
boasted a femcee on its roster
at some point: Lady of Rage
and Storm on Deathrow, Lil
Kim on Bad Boy, Eve on Ruff
Ryders, Remy Ma on Terror
Squad, Da Brat on So So Def,
Rah Digga on Flipmode and
Foxy Brown - who actually
started solo on Def Jam - later
on Roc-a-fella are just some
of the many female rappers

who had prominent positions
in some of rap's most storied
crews.
These women were not
just placeholders, though. Da
Brat, Foxy Brown, Lil Kim,
Eve, Missy Elliott and Lau-
ryn Hill all released platinum
albums in the 1990s, while
TLC, featuring the talents of
the incredible, late rapper Left
Eye, sold a whopping 21 mil-
lion records. What is impor-
tant to note, in addition to the
record sales, is these artists'
subject matter. While the lyr-
ics had certainly shifted from
feminist pioneers like Latifah
and Lyte in the late 1980s to a
more party-centric and sexed-
up approach, by no means was
sex the only subject matter for
these women. It was, as it was
for men, just another aspect.
No two rappers demon-
strated the unimportance of
blatant sex appeal in their
raps as did Missy Elliott and
Lauryn Hill, two of the most
successful and talented art-
ists - male or female - of
the past few decades. Missy's
groundbreaking debut, 1997's
Supa Dupa Fly, pushed sonic
boundaries with the help of a
then-up-and-coming producer
named Timbaland and proved
that female rappers didn't have
to exude sex to be success-
ful. Hill's magnum opus The
Miseducation ofLauryn Hill
went eight times platinum and
won five Grammys, including
Album of the Year. Even more
remarkable was the fact that
the album centered on themes
of love, race, class and religion,
not necessarily the makings of
a pop smash, especially from a
woman rapper. With the suc-
cesses of the aforementioned
women and the revolutionary
projects put forth by Hill and
Elliott, it's clear that the '90s
- specifically the latter half -
were the femcee golden age.
Sexualized
lyrics spell
demise for
female rappers.
The 2000s, however, were
the beginning of the end. As
more female rappers focused
solely on sexual and degrading
music (Khia, Trina, Jacki-O,
Foxy Brown, even Missy in
later years), the lyrical stan-
dard for women began to fade.
Lady of Rage, Da Brat, Rah
Digga and Three 6 Mafia's
Gangsta Boo (among others)
fell off the map by the mid-
2000s, while, maybe worst of
all, Lauryn Hill completely
stopped making music, plagued
by personal and legal troubles.
Eve released a platinum album
in 2001, a gold one in 2002 and
then not another until this past

year, while Lil Kim (before
going to jail) and Missy Elliott
both released their final proj-
ects in 2005.
What went wrong? One
theory could be that the three
most admirable and success-
ful femcees - Eve, Lauryn Hill
and Missy Elliott - stopped
putting out albums for a variety
of reasons, leaving their fellow
rappers with no leadership.
Another theory is that in the
mid-2000s, rap as a genre was
in a serious crisis (Nas named
his 2006 album Hip-Hop Is
Dead) and lyricism was no
longer appreciated. However, I
believe that what ultimately set
back female rappers is, unfor-
tunately but not unexpectedly,
the increasingly sexualized
nature of their raps, certainly
influenced by being women
working in a genre that has a
history of promoting misogy-
nistic and degrading sexual
content. Simply put, their sub-
ject matter has been limited to
only matters of sex. For many
femcees, it was either sex up
or fade out, and the few who
continued to sell records were
those who kept their sex appeal
at embarrassingly high levels.
Just look at Trina's first
verse from her aptly titled song
"No Panties," released in 2002:
"Look boo, what's the deal?
/ You got my cash so you can
stick it here? / I know you be
packing the steel / But I can't
suck your dick and get my lip-
stick smeared." Subtle is clearly
not in Trina's vocabulary.
Nicki Minaj is a great
example of this pressure.
Discovered by Lil Wayne as
a hard-spitting battle rapper
out of Queens, N.Y., Minaj is
now an overly-sexualized, self-
professed "Barbie" who seems
to turn on her lyrical abili-
ties - of which she has plenty
- only when forced to. Today,
major crews like Rick Ross's
Maybach Music, Kanye West's
G.O.O.D. Music and Jay-Z's Roc
Nation lack female rappers,
and though there is hope with
young rappers such as Azealia
Banks, Jean Grae, Angel Haze
and Rapsody - artists who
aren't as pressured by rap
music's pre-existing standards
into over-sexualizing them-
selves through sacrificing their
lyrical content and personal
integrity - the window of
opportunity for female emcees
appears discouragingly small.
"A woman can bear you,
break you, take you / Now it's
time to rhyme, can you relate
to / a sister dope enough to
make you holler and scream?"
Queen Latifah asked on "Ladies
First," and until the rap game
and the American public begins
acknowledging female rappers
again for their lyrics and not
their bodies, ladies will con-
tinue to be second.

DETROIT SOUP
From Page 1B
6:00 p.m. Simeon Heyer, owner
of the old Jam Handy, paid $13,000
for the building, a fact he still has
trouble wrappinghis mind around.
"I don't have any money," Heyer
said with a laugh. "The idea of me
owning anything is absurd."
Wearing a thin green sweater
and pants that sagged low on his
waist, he leaned against a wall in a
corner near the entrance, a canary
fluttering in a birdcage by his side
next to a semi-circle of chairs hold-
ingukuleles for aperformance later
in the night - the canary belonged
to the club
Originally from Minnesota,
Heyer moved to Detroit from
Madison, Wisconsin when he was
"bitten by the bug" - attracted,
like many others, to the city's do-it-
yourself culture. But, more impor-
tantly, he wanted to be in a place
where he felt he could make a dif-
ference.
"In Madison, you have a lot of
DIY stuff that's not necessary,"
he said. "Whereas here there are
so many things that are needed,
whether it's SOUP or just a get-
together."
He bought the building with
his brother three years ago as an
acquisition property from Wayne
County. After the Jam Handy
organization left in the late 1970s,
the property transitioned into a
televised church, Faith for Amer-
ica, followed by a string of other
churches and even, for a time, a
karate studio, before it became
deserted, Heyer said.
Renovating the property, for
him, has become "more than a

full-time job." it's a "lifestyle," he
said, funded by creative ventures
to which he rentsthe space, such as
theatre groups and Detroit SOUP.
He makes fixes based on necessity
- fundraising for heating, install-
ing plumbing, electricity. "Stuff
happens asnit's needed," he said.
His view of the space reflects
the kind of ground-up, communi-
ty-building mentality inherent to
SOUP.
"To the unaccustomed eye this
neighborhood looks bombed out
and unsafe. But it's not," he said.
"As with a lot of parts of Detroit,
people need a reason to go there.
I think SOUP, and a lot of things
that happen here, are a testament
to what people trusting each other
can accomplish."
For the time being, he said, part
of the city's character resides in
individuals' willingness to rely on
each other - after all, they kind of
have to.
"The city being weak and disor-
ganized creates terrible problems
for a lot of people," he said. "But
it also creates opportunities. And
the city is not capable of breathing
down your neck. This wouldn't be
possible anywhere else."
7:00 p.m. The word "democra-
cy" comes to mind. Before a crowd
of about 300, presenters get four
minutes each to share their ideas
and woo their peers for votes. Once
the presentations finish, in infor-
mal give-and-take sessions remi-
niscent of a town-hall meeting,
audience members ask questions,
grilling presenters on how exactly
they plan to spend the money.
"That's my favorite part," said
LSA senior Isabella Morrison, who
started a SOUP-style dinner in
Ann Arbor back in March. "People
want to know where their money is

going."
Proposals are submitted on
Detroit SOUP's website, with a
cutoff date of the Sunday before
the dinner. Typically receiving
between 10 and 25 submissions per
month, Kaherl and asteam of neigh-
borhood SOUP leaders decide
which four submissions appear
most dedicated to helping Detroit
and most deserve the chance to
present. Winners are then required
to return to a later SOUP to report
on how they have used the money,
a means of holding them account-
able.
As Kaherl told the crowd before
presentations began, there are
two rules to presenting at Detroit
SOUP: Projects must be about
Detroit and technology cannot be
used to present, in keepingwith the
stripped-down, barebones vibe of
the event. Still, later in the evening,
Kaherl introduced the new mobile
Detroit SOUP app, allowing you
to keep up with all things SOUP-
related around the city.
Tonight's four presenters
include Green Living Science,
a non-profit devoted to educat-
ing Detroit youth on environ-
mental issues; Eve's Angels, an
organization that aids women
trapped in the sex industry; Proj-
ect PEACE, an organization that
aids families of prisoners and ex-
felons; and Ec2 Lab, a mentor-
ing program fostering creativity
among young people.
Though some presenters were
poised, others grew nervous
from anxiety - four minutes is
just not much time. At one point,
Felisha Hatcher-Taylor, present-
ing with her daughter Jordan
on behalf of Ec2 Lab, broke into
tears, overcome with emotion.
"We won," she said after pre-
senting. "The fact that we were
here to raise awareness - that is
winning."
Kaherl, acting as the evening's
emcee, implored everyone, if
they had any ideas for funding
or support for these organiza-
tions outside of SOUP, to write
their ideas on a sticky note and
post the notes on posters near
the voting table by the building's
rear exit.
"Even though only one project
is going home with the money
raised this evening, everyone
goes home a winner!" read a
pamphlet distributed on each
table.
When presentations con-
clude, people literally break
bread with their neighbors. Dis-
cussions of the projects were
encouraged.
"Turn to your neighbor and
ask this question: What proj-
ect are you going to vote for?"
Kaherl told the crowd before
people began lining up for soup
and salad, provided by Avalon
Bakery.
8:00 p.m. Before leaving her
home in Munich, Germany for a
week-long trip to Detroit, There-
sa Juranek knew one thing about
the city: The food is cheap.
"We only read bad stuff about

The Detroit SOUP program meets once a month at the od Jam Handy building on C

it back in Germany," Juranek, 29,
said at her table, surrounded by
people she'd only met minutes
earlier. "You just read about how
bad it is, and we wanted to see if
it was true."
An automotive journalist,
she's here with her boyfriend
Axel Gundermann, a photog-
rapher, to research and write a
more positive story about Detroit
for people back home.
The reality, they said, has been
a welcome surprise. In their
short stay, they've been charmed
by the city's warm and welcom-
ing atmosphere. When they meet
Detroiters on the street, they're
engaged in friendly conversa-
tion, which wouldn't happen
back home, they said.
Between mouthfuls of bread,
Gundermann said an event like
SOUP would likely fail back in
Germany. When asked why, he
turned to Juranek and spoke a
few words to her in rapid-fire
German. After a moment, they
both sighed.
"(Germans) are too uptight,"
he said. "For whatever reason,
crowdfunding works much bet-
ter in the U.S."
While Kaherl said SOUP has
become more formal since its
creation three years ago, the
atmosphere here is mellow.
Engineering junior Chelsea
Pugh helped start a t-shirt com-
pany called DCH Apparel with
four other University students
last year that teaches design
and marketing skills to students
at Detroit Community High
School. The company won fund-
ing at last December's SOUP
dinner. What began as a class
project in "Change by Design,"
a class in the Penny W. Stamps
School of Art & Design, has per-
sisted - thanks, in part, to the
SOUP micro-grant.
Pugh remembers the casual,
laid-back atmosphere from when
her group won nearly a year ago.
"There are some events where

it's really professional and every-
one's dressed up and pitching
these entrepreneurial ideas,"
she said. "But (at SOUP) it was
really nice to see that everyone
was a normal person. It wasn't
like venture capitalists or any-
thing. It was normal people who
wanted good ideas in their com-
munity."
More than just time to think
about voting, the dinner itself is
a kind of theatrical experience.
A bearded man in a top hat goes
table to table, lecturing strang-
ers on the vital importance of
the <em>schwa</em> sound in
linguistics as a means to develop
a universal, global language; a
ukulele club performed; a small
child chased a dog through the
crowded mass of bodies.
But mainly people chat, net-
working and finding new ways
of working with each other to get
ideas and projects started.
"What I like about it is that
the people are deciding," said
Mary Luevanos, a Detroiter and
president of the Community for
Latino Artists Visionaries and
Educators. "The folks here are
making the decision and when
they're done with it they go off
and use the money thatthey need
it for. It's not a foundation decid-
ing. No one's pulling the strings."
8:45 p.m. The winner is
announced: It's Eve's Angels, the
organization dedicated to assisting
women in the sex trade. Marissa
Sheehy, presenting for the organi-
zation and a self-described "res-
cued angel," says the $1,519 they've
received will help establish a safe
house for the girls.
"We won $1,500, whichis amaz-
ing for speaking for four minutes,"
she said shortly after winning.
By night's end, crumbs and
plastic bowls lined with red
streaks of soup sauce lie scattered
across tables. Yet, within min-
utes, the plywood, tablecloths,
collapsible chairs, candles, bread
and soup are whisked away in

efficient fashion by eager, capa-
ble volunteers, jumping at the
chance to help clean up and play
their part.
Soon, the room is empty, save
for a few stay-behinds. A group
of bearded men in flannel shirts
and tight pants drinks beer and
laugh by the bar. Most of them
live in the neighborhood; some
live in the same building. Sheehy
does a video interview, still in
shock over her win.
Standing by the entrance,
where a man has begun to play
a white piano, Kaherl lets out a
deep breath. She says the event
was a success.
"Everyone walked away with
some sort of resource, some sort
of knowledge about how they can
participate together," she said.
She plans on taking the next day
off, but then it's right back to
work. "With Detroit SOUP we're
just going to keep moving into
neighborhoods, giving people
the chance to share their hearts,
their ideas."
And by the rear exit, Heyer is
locked in heated conversation
with two friends, who are also
heavy into the Detroit-renova-
tion scene. He gestures wildly,
like a man possessed, as he dis-
cusses the many buildings he
knows of in the city that deserve
repurposing.
When asked what's next for
the old Jam Handy now that
Detroit SOUP has finished, he
shrugs. SOUP will be back in
November, he says. Until then a
couple will get married here the 6
following weekend, a theatre
group might use it for rehearsal
space. But primarily, he'll keep
working - maybe adding lights,
painting walls, replacing doors.
Whatever it is that needs to be
done.
"As with most things here,
everything's so informal," he
said. "We just do a little bit at a
time. It's still mostly just a shell
of a building."
