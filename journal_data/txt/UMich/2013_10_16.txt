U.S. justices hear
oral arguments on
ballot initiative
By TAYLOR WIZNER
AND K.C. WASSMAN
Daily News Editors
WASHINGTON, D.C. -
Affirmative action in Michi-
gan has once again taken
center stage in the U.S.
Supreme Court.
The high court heard
oral arguments Tuesday -for
Schuette v. Coalition to Defend
Affirnmative Action, which
questions the legality of a
2006 amendment - commonly

known as Proposal 2 - to the
Michigan State Constitution
that bans race-based prefer-
ences in college admission
process. The court must weigh
whether or not a state ban
on race- or sex-based admis-
sions is in violation of the 14th
amendment's equal protec-
tion cause. The case brings
up questions of unfair burden
put upon minority communi-
ties, who would have to take
to courts to change admission
policy instead of that institu-
tion's governing body.
The case came to the U.S.
Supreme Court after the
state appealed the Sixth Cir-
cuit Court's decision, which
struck down equal protection

concerns, based on precedent
set in Washington v. Seattle
School District No. 1. In that
1981 case, the Court found
a statewide initiative for a
neighborhood-school policy
put an unconstitutional bur-
den on racial minorities by
reordering the decision-mak-
ing process.
In order for the court to
overturn the Sixth Circuit
Court's ruling, five of the eight
participating justices - Justice
Elena Kagan having recused
herself from this case - would
have to rule against the lower
court's decision.
If the justices are split in
a 4-4 vote, the ruling is auto-
matically deferred to the lower

court's verdict.
John Bursch, the state's
solicitor general, represented
Michigan Attorney General
Bill Schuette, who appealed
the Sixth Circuit Court's deci-
sion to the court. In his allot-
ted thirty minutes of time,
Bursch argued that it is up
to, each state to determine
whether or not they would like
race-based admissions.
During his opening state-
ments, Bursch noted it's
unclear whether or not diver-
sity has declined at the Uni-
versity in the wake of Proposal
2. He said the 2010 change in
the mandate for reporting
race, which allowed students

At its monthly meeting on
Friday, the University's Board

number of construction and
renovation proposals - nmostly

SCHEMATIC DESIGNS
FOR THE EARL V. MOORE
BUILDING RENOVATION
Though the regents approved
$23,270,000 for the Earl V.
Moore Building's renovation
lastNovember, the board will
vote Friday to approve the
project's schematic design and
slight budget increase.

The Moore Building, the
North Campus facility that
houses a portion of the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance, will
receive upgrades and expan-
sions to classroom spaces as
well as infrastructure updates.
The revised budget - which
now totals more than $24 mil-
lion- will allow for 4,600 addi-
tional square feet of mechanical
space that was not included in
the initial estimate.
The renovations to the facil-
ity will include changes to both
the first and second floor's
north wing. These changes will
increase the number and size
of practice rooms and will relo-
cate offices originally moved for
practice room expansion.
The larger part of the proj-
edt, a 34,000-square-foot build-
ing addition named the Brehm
Pavilion, will include three
classrooms, a large lecture hall,
piano labs, a jazz and percus-
sion suite, a rehearsal hall,lobby
and space reserved for, future
expansion.
The schematic designs also
call for updates to the build-
ing's fire detection and alarm
systems.

College Democrats campaign
in Virginia over Fall Break

Entrepreneurship clinic
helps students innovate

Volunteers canvass
for McAuliffe,
educate community
By KRISTEN FEDOR
For the Daily
Friday, members of the Uni-
versity's chapter of College
Democrats traveled to Virginia
during Fall Break to work on
gubernatorial candidate Terry
McAuliffe's campaign.
Campaign trips over the
short break are a tradition for
the group. For 2012, members
of the College Democrats trav-
eled to volunteer for President
Barack Obama's reelection
campaign in Akron, Ohio.
LSA senior Sonja Karnovsky,
treasurer for the College Dem-
ocrats, said it's important for
members, to see how political
organizing works outside of
greater Ann Arbor.

"Our campaign work is about
finding candidates we can get
behind and help them out in
any way we can - to make sure
that Democrats win across
Washtenaw County, the state of
Michigan and the entire U.S.,"
Karnovsky said.
After a failed bid for the
Democratic nomination in
Virginia's 2009 gubernato-
rial election, McAuliffe is now
the Democratic nominee for
the 2013 race against Republi-
can candidate Ken Cuccinelli.
According to averages by Real
Clear Politics, McAuliffe is
polling seven points ahead of
Cuccinelli.
In the past, McAuliffe served
as the national finance chair-
man of both former President
Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign
and as chairman of former Sec-
retary of State Hillary Clinton's
2008 campaign for the Demo-
cratic presidential nomination.
McAuliffe was also the chair-

man of the Democratic Nation-
al Convention in 2000 and
served as its chairman from
2001 to 2005.
Volunteers from the Uni-
versity were based in Henrico
County, Virginia, just outside
of Richmond. They spent the
weekend canvassing, knocking
on doors of Democratic voters,
making sure they knew when
Election Day was and voting-
site locations.
LSA junior Mary Bridget
Lee, communications direc-
tor of the College Democrats,
spoke of the buzzing atmo-
sphere.
"People knew about the cam-
paign, and they were excited to
vote," she said.
LSA junior Meg Scribner,
chair of the College Democrats,
also elaborated upon the notion
that cross-country travel is
vital to the mission of the orga-
nization.
Scribner attributed the
excitement around the Virginia
ubernatorial contest to the
idespread national attention-
hat it has garnered in an off-
ear election.
As a swing state, the results
from Virginia can often shift
momentum in one party's favor,
looking toward future presi-
dential elections as well.
"If a Democrat wins the gov-
ernor seat, then it is going to be
much more on the Democrats'
side in 2016," Scribner said.

Law School offers
legal guidance to
student innovators
By ALLANA AKHTAR
DailyStaffReporter
The University is a hotbed for
innovation.
A co-founder of Google, the
inventor of the iPod and the
former CEO of Skype are all
University alums. Plus, the Uni-
versity's Office of Tech Trans-
fer said last week that a record
number of inventions - 421 -
were born at the University in
the past fiscal year.
And, in 'an effort to reach
out to promising undergradu-
ates, the University launched
its Master of Entrepreneurship
Joint Degree, sponsored by the
College of Engineering, the
Ross School of Business and the
Office of Technology Transfer.
But University students, who
continue to share business ideas
and develop projects, may be
unaware that there are numer-
ous resources on campus to help
them navigate the often-con-
fusing legalities that come with
starting a company.
The Law School's Entrepre-
neurship Clinic, part of the Zell
Entrepreneurship and Law Pro-
gram - also known as ZEAL -
was created in January 2012 to

offer legal guidance to Univer-
sity student entrepreneurs. So
far, the clinic has already repre-
sented over 30 clients.
Common legal concerns of
startups include forming a par-
ticular type of company, intel-
lectual property issues and
finance documentation.
The clinic was the brainchild
of University alum Samuel Zell
- ZEAL's namesake and a major
University donor - and Evan
Caminker, dean emeritus of the
Law School.
"Michigan is a very entrepre-
neurial campus," ZEAL Direc-
tor Erik Gordon said. "We have
students from every college,
undergrads, graduates, who are
constantly coming up with new
businesses - and they need
help."
For example, Gordon
explained that students who
start working together on busi-
nesses are usually unaware of
the legal liabilities of their part-
nership. He said it's important
that students seek legal help so
they understand what they're
getting into.
The clinic also provides
opportunities for Law stu-
dents to develop relationships
with other students who could
become their post-graduation
clients.
Law Prof. Dana Thompson,
director of the clinic, said the
clinic allows students to go

beyond the walls of the Law
school and become immersed
in the "entrepreneurial ecosys-
tem" on campus.
"It's a great opportunity for
student venturers who are at
the Engineering School or Busi-
ness School or other schools
to really see the importance
of addressing legal issues as
they're setting up their com-
pany," she said.
Along with the Law School
Clinic, the Schools of Engi-
neering and Business also have
entrepreneurial clinics set up in
their respective colleges to pro-
vide support services to current
student entrepreneurs.
The clinic it also holds work-
shops at MPowered programs
and the TechArb for general
legal information and is cur-
rently developing educational
materials.
Thompson encourages stu-
dent entrepreneurs to attend
office hours, which are "open
to anybody on campus who's
an entrepreneur in figuring out
a particular answer to a legal
question they may have and we
also provide general informa-
tion about that legal topic."
Office hours are held Fridays
from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. at the Cen-
ter for Entrepreneurship locat-
ed in the Duderstadt Center and
2 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the Zell Lurie
Institute in the Ross School of
Business.

Hankook to build
$800M plant in

South Korean tire-maker Han-

1,800 jobs.
Hankook, the world's seventh-

build the $800 million facility in
Clarksville. Construction on the
1.5 million-square-foot facility is
scheduled to begin by next year,
and it will begin making high-end

Seung Hwa Sub, Hankook's
vice chairman and CEO, called the
construction of the U.S. plant "the
next natural phase for our contin-

that the decision to build the plant
in Tennessee was the result of a
year of discussions with state offi-

major factors.

Beyond having to deal with six

problem: back pains so intense he's
had to use a wheelchair.
Zarif heads the Iranian delega-

United States, Russia, China, Brit-
ain, France and Germany.
He apparently wasn't keen on
sharing his ailment with the pub-
lic. Instead of leaving his posh

hours after returning from the
talks and complaining of back
pains, he was wheeled out of the
service entrance and into a wait-

with Norris to bring the project to
campus in February.
Norris also continues to con-
tribute to NPR as a special corre-
spondent and occasional host.
Before joiningNPR, she worked
as a correspondent for ABC News,
earning professional acclaim for
her contributions to the network's
coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks.
She is also the author of The Grace
of Silence: A Memoir, a 2009 book
that takes a retrospective look at
her own family's story in the con-
text of America's history of race
relations. Norris received her
undergraduate degree from the
University of Wisconsin, Madi-
son and studied journalism at the
University of Minnesota.
In an interview Friday, Uni-
versity Provost Martha Pollack
said Norris's time on campus
during LSA's "Understanding
Race" theme semester and the
Race Card Project demonstrated
a commitment to cultivating a
dialogue on diversity. Norris also
delivered the Martin Luther King
Jr. Day convocation in 2012.
"She's a journalist of major
social issues - and the Univer-
sity is very concerned with social
issues," Pollack said. "We have
enormous regard for her integrity
and commitment to understand-
ing and celebrating diversity in
this country. Those are things we
value as well."
During one of her discussions
on race earlier this year, Norris
said the University's contribution
to the Race Card Project has given
her exceptional learning opportu-
nities and insights.
"Michigan definitely has a
place in history for all the things
it's pioneered, so there's a very
natural partnership between the
University. and the Race Card
Project," Norris said in Febru-
ary. "Since we began this year,
responses have been pouring in,
and they run the gamut."
The other five individuals
receiving honorary degrees from
the University are:
Willard L. "Sandy" Boyd: The
Rawlings-Miller professor of law
and former president of the Uni-
versity of Iowa will receive an

honorary Doctor of Laws. Boyd
received two degrees from the
University of Michigan: his LLM
in 1952 and his SJD in 1962. After
serving as the University of Iowa's
president from 1964 to 1969, he
served as the president of the
Chicago-based Field Museum of
Natural History from 1981to1996.
He is a member of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences
and helped establish the Larned
A. Waterman Iowa Nonprofit
Resource Center, which is dedi-
cated to providing information
and aid to Iowa-based nonprofits.
William Higuchi: A pharma-
ceutical scientist and former
member of the University's fac-
ulty, Higuchi will be granted
an honorary Doctor of Science.
Higuchi received his doctorate
in pharmaceutical chemistry and
biopharmaceutics from the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley in
1956 and was at the University
of Michigan from 1962 to 1982,
having served as the Albert B.
Prescott distinguished professor
of pharmacy and as a professor of
dentistry. He is currently a pro-
fessor emeritus at the University
of Utah.
As a Japanese-American, Higu-
chi was interned in a relocation
center in Wyoming during World
War II and has remained active
in the preservation of the former
site. He also received the Order of
the Rising Sun - the highest gen-
erally conferred honor awarded
by the Japanese government - in
2011 for his work in both pharma-
ceuticals and "improv(ing) the
social status of Japanese-Ameri-
cans."
David Satcher: A forme' U.S.
surgeon general who served
under both the Clinton and Bush
administrations, Satcher will
receive an honorary Doctor of
Science. Satcher served simulta-
neously as surgeon general and
assistant secretary of health for
the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services from 1998to
2001 and then solely maintained
the surgeon general role until
2002. He is the only four-start
admiral to serve in those posi-
tions.
Since leaving public service,
Satcher has worked in various
roles at the historically black
Morehouse College School of
Medicine in Georgia and is cur-

rently the director of the Satcher

Simon received national atten-
tion in 2006 by joining University
President Mary Sue Coleman in
opposition of the passage of Pro-
posal 2, which banned the use of
affirmative action in the admis-
sions process. She has also made
economic development a focal
point of her presidency, looking
for innovative ways to improve
Michigan's competitiveness. In
2012, Simon was selected as the
chair of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association's Executive
Committee, the organization's

28-year-old New
Zealander penned
'luminous' winner
LONDON (AP) - Youth
and heft triumphed at Brit-
ain's Booker Prize on Tues-
day, as 28-year-old New
Zealander Eleanor Catton
won the fiction award for
"The Luminaries," an ambi-
tious 832-page murder mys-
tery set during a 19th-century
gold rush.
- The choice should give
heart to young authors of
oversized tales. Catton is the
youngest writer and only the
second New Zealander to win
the prestigious award - and
her epic novel is easily the
longest Booker champion.
Catton said after accept-
ing the award that she didn't
think about the length of the
book while she was writing it,

"partly because I was inside it
for the whole time."
"It wasn't until I received
the proof of the book that
I thought, 'Jeepers, this is
actually quite heavy,"' she
said. "I've had to buy a new
handbag, because my old
handbag wasn't big enough to
hold my book."
She thanked her British
publisher, Granta, for pro-
tecting her from feeling the
commercial pressures around
a tome that could be seen as
"a publisher's nightmare." .
Travel writer Robert Mac-
farlane, who chaired the
judging panel, called "The
Luminaries" "dazzling,"
"luminous" and "vast without
being sprawling."'
"It is beautifully intricate
without being fussy," Macfar-
lane said. "It is experimental
... but does not by any means
neglect the traditional vir-
tues of storytelling."

Closing channels, adding burdens
The U.S. Supreme Court should favor invlusive governance
This week, the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments on Michi-
gan's Proposal 2, a ballot initiative passed in 2006 that outlawed
race and sex as a decision factor in public university admissions
and public-sector hiring. Since then, minority representation has plum-
meted at the University, and the law has been overturned in federal court.
Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a staunch opponent of affirma-
tive action, is now appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court.

This case, Schuette v. Coalition to Defend
Affirmative Action, differs from the 2003
case Grutter v. Bollinger, in which the Court
upheld the University's use of race as a factor
in admissions decision. In part as a result of
that ruling, Proposal 2 was put on the ballot
for Michigan voters a few years later..Instead,
the argument in Schuette is over the ballot ini-
tiative itself and whether voters can eliminate
policies that are ruled constitutional.
Supporters of -affirmative-action argue that
Proposal 2 violates equal protection as it places
undue burden on minorities. Typically, protests
against policies like those regarding affirmative
action, legacy preference or other "special con-
siderations" for admission are brought before a
university's governing body, like the University's
Board of Regents. The ballot initiative is unfair
because those wishing to challenge it cannot go
to theBoard of Regents - the democratic institu-
tion set up particularly for this purpose. Instead,
they instead must amend the state constitution -
a difficult task by design. It would require a two-
thirds majority in both chambers of the state
legislature, another ballot initiative or a special
constitutional convention for an amendment to
pass. This places minorities at an unfair advan-
tage to change the policy, denying them their
equal treatment underthe law. Other groups like
veterans, parents or legacy students don't have to

go through this difficult process.
Furthermore, ballot initiatives were not
originally part of the democratic repertoire.
The Progressive party added the mechanism
in the twentieth century as a way to get ordi-
nary citizens more involved in directly chang-
ing and influencing government and to make
government more responsive. Recently, how-
ever, the mega-wealthy and special interest
groups have ,used referendums to influence
policy to their liking. Additionally, people who
voted for Proposal 2 - also called the "Michi-
gan Civil Rights Initiative" - may have been
misled by the title that appeared on the bal-
lot. The wording of the ballot initiative took
advantage of inadequately informed voters
who support civil rights - a dogma not fur-
thered by abolishing affirmative action.
Proposal 2 closes avenues to democratic
change to minorities. According to Judge R.
Guy Cole Jr. - the author of the opinion from
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit
- "the majority may not manipulate the chan-
nels of change so as to place unique burdens on
issues of importance to them." For that reason,
the U.S. Supreme Court should strike down
this amendment. If any real solution is to be
found, minorities and marginalized communi-
ties must be free to represent their own inter-
ests in a waythat is equal and fair.

W ASHINGTON, D.C. -
"What's strongest? The
rock, the paper or the
scissors?"
A group of
about 40 kids,
eachnoolderthan
12, stood across
the street from
the U.S. Supreme
Court listening to
their tour guide JAMES
-a stocky, gray- BRENNAN
haired man with BRE__A__
a short beard.
"None of
them, right? Well, that's just like
Washington."
In theory, this analogy is quite
apt. Each branch of government is
assigned no more power than any
of the others, able to overrule deci-
sions through checks and balances.
But as we all know, government is
hardly this balanced or simple. The
courts often overpower all other
branches, while some presidents
expand executive power beyond
constitutional limitations.
Like our system of governance,
affirmative action is far more complex
than we'd like it to be. Both sides of
the debate over Michigan's 2006 bal-
lot proposalthat banned most formsof
race and gender-conscious admissions
argued in front ofthe strongest branch
of government Tuesday. It was made
clear that neither the Court nor affir-
mative action are as easy to under-
stand as rock, paper, scissors.
"This is about the political
process"
After speaking with Mike Stein-
berg, legal director of the American
Civil Liberties Union of Michigan,
it was made abundantly clear that
the usual debate about the merits of
race-conscious admissions wouldn't
be on the table. What was at stake,
according to Steinberg, was the right
of minorities to be treated equally
in the political process. Proposal 2
did not sinply outlaw an unpopular
policy by referendum, but it created
a separate and unequal process for
minorities to lobby for their interests.
The state has made it so any minority
group that wants to request the Uni-
versity Board of Regents to consider
race has to gather thousands of sig-
natures, run an entire statewide cam-
paign and overturn a ballot proposal.
Citing precedent in a similar case that

involved busing, Seattle v. Washington,
Steinberg believes that Proposal 2 cre-
ates two separate and unequal playing
fieldsbased on race.
Caroline Wong, national organizer
of By Any Means Necessary, gave me
similar arguments, asserting that Pro-
posal 2 is reminiscent of Jim Crow
Laws.Whenchallengedonthelegality
ofoverturningaballot proposal demo-
cratically decided on by an entire state,
Wong cited an amicus brief by dozens
ofhistory professors drawing parallels'
to state laws designed to disenfran-
chise minorities. According to Wong,
stopping minorities from petitioning
universities is just another attempt to
subvert people of color without actu-
ally codifying racism - a violation of
the 14thamendment.

Proposal 2, her
arguments were -
a 'rarity among
BAMN protesters outside the court.
University students told me they
came to fight for race-conscious
admissions, greater diversity and
equality for people of color. When
asked why the Supreme Court
should exercise its ultimate power
and throw out a popular ballot ini-
tiative, they struggled, clinging to
simplistic reasons and failing to
move beyond a single frame of mind.
One University student cited
the fact that a majority white state
passed the law, only doing so to
maintain white privilege. Another
University student rattled off facts
about dropping minority enroll-
ment, but could only explain the
need to overturn Proposal'2 as a
matter of racial justice and whites
outvoting minorities. A Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley student
admitted she couldn't articulate
why Proposal 2 was unconstitution-
al, but simply reinstating affirmative
action was reason enough for her to
come protest. A national organizer,
speaking into a megaphone, accused
the majority of Supreme Court jus-
tices of being racist.
This dissonance isn't just on the
side of BAMN. Attorney General Bill

I'm unim-

Or maybe I'm just frustrated that
people still don't understand
affirmative action.
Since the first time I stood up
against my entire high school gov-
ernment class to argue in favor of
affirmative action, I have rarely
seen coherence in interpreting a
race-conscious admissions policy.
Proponents seem to only defend it
because they feel they're supposed
to, while opponents are blind to the
realities of racism.
Affirmative action is a complex
policy with pros, cons and a lot of
moving parts. It can't be opposed
simply because it "sounds" discrimi-
natory, and it can't be defended and
implemented because "diversity is
good" and "we want justice." Affirma-
tive action is a complicated, constantly
evolving issue - if you decide to take
a stance, understand that. While it
would be nice if affirmative action
were as simple and neat as a game of
rock, paper, scissors, it simply is not.

Schuette wrote an op-ed in the Detroit
Free Press on Sunday purely attack-
ing the merits of affirmative action,
never once mentioning Proposal 2
- let alone the issues at hand in the
case itself. Some opponents of affir-
mative action are also fully ignorant
to the state of race-based admissions
as a whole. Multiple Black students
explained that some white students
concluded they were only admitted
to Michigan because of affirmative
action, a sentiment I'e heard in per-
son plenty of times. Apparently, some
opponents of affirmative action don't
even realize that the University has
been barred from using race in admis-
sions for the better part of a decade.

AARICA MARSH I
A temporary solution

WASHINGTON, D.C. - University President
Mary Sue Coleman once said, "Diversity is an old,
old wooden ship that was used during the Civil
War era." Oh, never mind - Iguess that was Ron
Burgundy in Anchorman.
Unlike Burgundy, Coleman and University
administrators seemingly understand the con-
cept and implications of diversity. As soon as stu-
dents begin their admissions applications,they're
bombarded with the importance of diversity at
the University. However, school demographics
paint a very different picture.
The enrollment of minority students has sig-
nificantly dropped since the implementation of
Proposal 2 - which banned race and gender-
based affirmative action in the state of Michi-
gan - in November 2006. Seven years ago, the
University was considered a frontrunner in
embracing diversity. The class of 2017 - current
freshmen - is 7.3 percent African American, 5.6
percent Hispanic and 1.1 percent Native Ameri-
can. Unfortunately, undergraduate enrollment
for people ofcolor has droppedby approximately
one-thirdinsixyears. 2012 statisticsindicatethat
African Americans constituted 4.6 percent of the
undergraduate population, Hispanics 4.3 percent
and Native Americans 0.17 percent.
Since Proposal 2 was enacted, the Coalition
to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration
and Immigrant Rights By Any Means Neces-
sary, the American Civil Liberties Union, the
National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People and many University profes-
sors and students have worked to overturn the
amendment in Michigan. BAMN immediately
filed a lawsuit against the ban, citing violation
of the 4th amendment.
In December 2006, a different case, Cantrgll
et. al v. Granholm, was brought forward by the
ACLU and NAACP Legal Defense and Education
fund on behalf of University students and faculty.
The Cantrellsiderelied heavily onthenotionthat
Proposal 2 created an unequal political process
where people could lobby the University's Board
of Regents to admit more students from their
interest group - athletes, legacies, students from
the Upper Peninsula, etc. - except for interest
groups concerned with race.
The two cases were consolidated early on due
to their similar positions about the constitution-
alityofMichigan's banonaffirmative action.Pro-
posal 2 was upheld in the district courts in 2008
and then overturned by the Sixth Circuit Court
of Appeals in 2011. The case was then appealed
to the U.S. Supreme Court and accepted the jus-
tices in March 2013. Oral arguments were heard
onOctober15.
As the attorneys and justices settled in for
their hearing, four police officers lined the steps
anticipating protesters who had not yet arrived.
Three officers were stationed closer to the
Supreme Court doors while five others roamed
the perimeter. Loud whistles, chanting and a

megaphone announced the arrival of BAMN
members and other affirmative action support-
ers. They appeared in front of the court steps as
10 more police officers drove up on motorcycles.
Chants echoed throughout the area.
"They sayJim Crow, we say hell no!"
"Integration now, segregation never!"
"Black, Latino, Arab, Asian and.White, by any
means necessary we will fight!"
Several University students stood among the
crowd where the majority of protesters were
from minority populations. The demographics
were drastically different than Michigan class-
rooms where oftentimes a minority student may
be the only person of their community present.
In these situations, the burden of representation
becomesvery severe.
"It's discouraging. It's frustrating. It makes
you doubt yourself. You have to fight and try to
work so much harder," noted Education senior
Ariam Abraham. Abraham said she many times
took the lead ongroup projects becauseshe didn't
want to be associated with society-created ste-
reotypesofBlackpeople.
LSA sophomores Lewis Graham and Chris
Ransburg, both Black, affirmed Abraham's
experiences. In a chemistry class of over 200,
Graham could count on one hand the Black
students in his class, creating pressure for
him to work harder and be better. Ransburg.
felt similarly: "I want to stand out. If I mess
up, it's not just me that's messing up."
It's indisputable that the University's
minority population has been dwindling
since 2006. As a result, minority students are
forced to represent their entire population
creating unfair burdens and obstacles. Diver-
sity doesn't just benefit minorities. It benefits
everybody through new understandings of
people who are different from you. So is affir-
mative action the answerto creating diversity
among college campuses?
It is regularly noted that the basis of the
problem lies not in college admissions but in
the continuing oppression of minority stu-
dents through education, geographic and
socio-economic means. "It's the mentality of
people that needs to change," added Adelia
Davis, anLSA freshman at the protest.
Unfortunately, these problems can't be
solved overnight. Affirmative action may not
be the ideal solution to create a more diverse
campus. There are obvious flaws. It often per-
petuates the idea that minority students are
only accepted due to their race. It ignores the
struggles of lower-income students. It doesn't
help retain minority students after they are
accepted. Affirmative action cannot solve any
of these problems. It is a temporary solution
for much larger issues. But while these issues
are being worked on, it will have to do.

Student protest and aff. action

The recent We Are Michigan pro-
test and U.S. Supreme Court hearing
on affirmative action calls to mind the
longhistory ofstudentprotest on cam-
pus around racial diversity. Building
a more inclusive campus requires an
understanding of past anti-racist stu-
dent movements.
After Martin Luther King Jr.'s
assassination in 1968, 100 Black stu-
dents locked themselves in an admin-
istrative building to address low Black
enrollment. Their demands included
the appointment of Black administra-
tors and the establishment of a U-M
Martin, Luther King Jr. Scholarship.
The lock-in resulted in the establish-
ment of the scholarship and the insti-
tution of the Center of Afroamerican
and African Studies (CAAS, now the
departmentofAfroamericanand Afri-
can Studies) in 1970.
This takeover initiated student
movements that mobilized coalitions,
articulated explicit demands and uti-
lized direct-action protest strategies
to create a more inclusive campus for
students of color. In 1970, the student-
led Black Action Movement organized
a massive protest to draw attention to
racial disparities on campus. Students
fought for a Black Student Center,
tuition waivers, additional funding fdr
the MLKscholarship, andmostimpor-
tantly, a University commitment to a
10-percent goal of Black enrollment
within three years. The administra-
tion initially agreed to only the enroll-
ment goal. BAM responded by taking
hundreds of books off the shelves in
the library, interrupting classes, pick-
eting parking garages and blocking
State Street. These disruptive tactics
caused LSA attendance to drop by
75 percent. The strikers gained more
power by enlisting white students
and organized labor. The University
agreed to devote more resources to
achieving the 10-percent goal by the
1973academicyearandincreasefinan-
cial support to CAAS.
The multiracial United Coalition
Against Racism renewed the fight for
minority rights in 1987. Two hundred
students blocked, Fleming Hall and

issued 12 explicit demands. These
focused on the unfulfilled promise
of minority enrollment, anti-racist
education and low numbers of Black
faculty. UCAR also demanded the
University close in recognition of
MLK Day; the University refused
to cancel classes to commemorate
the day until six years after it was
declared a national holiday. Most
significantly, students reasserted the
minority enrollment issue broached
in 1968. Black students remained a
mere 5 percent of the student body.
The University drafted the "Michi-
gan Mandate" - a comprehensive
plan to increase diversity on campus.
Last week's demonstration mirrors
the Mandate's core ideas: commitment
to diversity, representationofminority
groups and a pluralistic community.
The Mandate aimed for students of
color to represent atleast athird ofthe
student body by the endof the 1990s.
The University glowingly reported a
39 percent increase of students of color.
It even assured this growth would
lead to 14 percent Black enrollment by
1996, matching the state population at
the time. The University's confidence
in 1991 contrasts sharply with our
current climate. For example, Black
and Latina/o enrollment is under 5
percent. A partial explanation to the
rollback of minority enrollment is the
affirmative action debate of the last
decade. In the early 2000s, Michigan
nearly reached BAM's original goal
of 10 percent Black enrollment. How-
ever, Proposal 2 banned consideration
of race, sex and religion in University
admissions. Since the passage of Pro-
posal 2, the Black student population
has dropped from 6.5 percent in 2006
to 4.6 percent in 2012.
Still, widespread confusion about
the meaning and efficacy of affirma-
tive action remains. One obscuring
argument is that the dismantling of
affirmative action led to a more posi-
tive climate for students of color. Carl
Cohen, a University of Michigan pro-
fessor who spearheaded the Proposal
2 initiative, told the Daily in 2011:
"When you see Blacks on our campus

now, they didn't get here with prefer-
ence. You can't look down your nose
at minorities at Michigan now... And
I think that's a great thing for the
minorities. They don't have to excuse
themselves." The hostile response to
the recent viewpoint by LSA senior
Dan Green reveals the fallacy of this
argument. Commenters challenged
himto reveal his GPA,ACTscore and
tuition costs, after he wrote about
the discomfort he feels as a Black
Detroiter in Ann Arbor. Affirmative
action does not cause a hostile cam-
pus climate. It is the already-exist-
ing negative perceptions about the
inferiority of students of color. For
some, affirmative action becomes a
convenient scapegoat.
As the examples of BAM and
UCAR demonstrate, grassroots stu-
dent activism has driven efforts
to create a more diverse and sup-
portive campus. These actions have
been led by students of color, but
have always comprised white allies,
faculty/staff and others from the
campus community. They relied on
a combination of direct-action pro-
tests, explicit demands and disrup-
tion of normal campus operations.
These tactics succeeded in building
leverage for students who otherwise
had little decision-making power in
University policies. However, strug-
gling for a more inclusive university
should not fall squarely on the shoul-
ders of those underrepresented: The
University must take more than a
"wait and see" stance and facilitate
broader dialogue about these issues.
Student activists should build on the
rich history and lessons of student
protest on campus. And all students *
must educate themselves about how
privilege functions in university
life. Only through the combination
of strong student protest, education
and an active administration can we
begin to realize the aspirations of
this legacy of activism.

of By Any Means Neces-
- a coalition that supports
ative action -, asked the
to uphold the Sixth Circuit
s decision and to return
Fourteenth Amendment
o its "original purpose to
t minority rights against a
majority."

Justice Antonin Scalia imme-
diately questioned Driver's inter-
pretation of the amendment and
asked her to provide an example
of a case of the current court that
confirms her view that the four-
teenth amendment only protects
minorities, which Driver could
not.
Justice Stephen Breyer also
entered the discussion, giving
Driver hypothetical situations
about employment based on pref-
erences and asking her where the
line is drawn in regards to pref-
erential treatment for jobs and
admissions.
In response, Driver said she
believes the Seattle ruling pro-
vides the line and that the court
should uphold the precedent-set
in that case.
Justice Samuel Alito ques-
tioned Driver about when exact-
ly the problem with Proposal 2
becomes an issue in the admis-
sions-decision process. After
back-and-forth between the two,
Sotomayor stepped in to provide
her opinion, which Driver said
summed up the point she was
attempting to make.
"I thought the line was a very
simple one, which is if the nor-
mal academic decision-making
is in the dean, the faculty, at
whatever level, as long as the
normal right to control is being
exercised then that person could
change the decision," Sotomayor
said. "It's when the process has
changed specifically and only for
race, as a constitutional amend-
ment here was intended to do,
that the political doctrine is vio-
lated."
Driver's final moments in
front of the Court centered on
whether or not affirmative-
action programs are beneficial to
a minority group specifically, or
to the University as a whole, as
ruled in Grutter.
This discussion stemmed from
the earlier points made by Bur-
sch about minorities benefiting
from Prop 2. Driver combated
this in her final moments by say-
ing 90 percent of Black voters in
Michigan voted against the pro-
posal and that whether or not
affirmative action is beneficial is
for a different case; specifically
the already resolved Grutter.
The oral arguments concluded
with a four-minute rebuttal from
Bursch, which emphasized that-
Seattle is not a direct parallel to
this case.
Lawyers involved in the case
posit that the deciding vote will
likely come from Kennedy, who
questioned specific arguments
from both sides but said he had
trouble distinguishing between
the ruling on the Seattle case and
the debate over Proposal 2.

WASHINGTON
From Page 1A
take on Shuette v. Coalition
to Defend Affirmative Action,
which questions the legality of a
2006 amendment to Michigan's
constitution - commonly known
as Proposal 2 - that bans race-
or sex-based admissions policies
at the states' public colleges and
universities.
After the arguments conclud-
ed, University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said in a statement
that the University values diver-
sity but is firm in its admission
practices.
"The University of Michigan
places a high value on achieving
a richly diverse student body,"
Fitzgerald said. "It is a corner-
stone of our academic character
and excellence.
Proposal 2 has made-admit-
ting a diverse student body more
challenging. And, as we indicat-
ed in our brief, we do not believe
that one can assess the impact
of Proposal 2 by looking at the
experiences of other institutions
in other states operating under
other laws."
Lawyers arguing on behalf
of the coalition, including Mark
Rosenbaum, attorney for the
NAACP and the American Civil
Liberties Union and Shanta
Driver, chair of the Coalition to
Defend Affirmative Action, said
they thought the oral arguments
went well, citing some of Justice
Anthony Kennedy's statements
as particularly encouraging.
"We wanted to see if there
was any responsiveness from
any of the other five justices to
our argument, and I think we
achieved that goal." Driver said
in an interview after the oral
arguments. "I think where we
saw the openness was on Judge
Kennedy, but none of the justices
seemed that comfortable with
(Michigan Attorney General Bill
Schuette's) argument."
Michael Steinberglegal direc-
tor of the ACLU of Michigan, also
said he thought the arguments
went well for the Coalition.
"Given the questions that were
asked, we're very optimistic that

the court is going to do the right
thing," Steinberg said. "They
seem to understand that a sepa-
rate, unequal system for students
of color to lobby for programs
that will help them is unfair and
unconstitutional."
Schuette, the petitioner in the
case, said in a merit brief pre-
sented to court that past prece-
dent and the Constitution should
uphold their argument.
"The people of Michigan con-
cluded that not having affirma-
tive action in higher education
was the best policy for the state,"
Schuette wrote. "Nothing in the
Constitution bars the people
of Michigan from making that
choice."
In an op-ed to the Washington
Times Schuette elaborated on
his position saying that the real
problem with underrepresented
minorities in colleges lies within
our public schools.
"This legal challenge against
Michigan's constitution misses
the point. The problem that
needs to be solved is this: too
many minority students are
trapped in failing public schools.
The system is failing them,"
Schuette wrote. "Graduation
rates are far toolow; illiteracy far
too high. This is where drastic
change and reform are needed."
Before, during and after the
oral arguments, protesters from
the By Any Means Necessary, a
national organization that advo-
cates for affirmative action, held
a rally that started at the Lincoln
Memorial. The group marched
from there to the Court's steps,
rallyingsupporters of race-based
admission policies. As people
exited the Court after oral argu-
ments, members of the rally
shouted "Detroit, what do we
want? Affirmative Action. When
do we want it? Now."
Among the faces in the audi-
ence listeningto the chants were
Education senior Ariam Abra-
ham and University alum Laura
Washington. Both said they
drove from Michigan on Monday
to hear the case and support the
affirmative-action ideals iterated
by BAMN.
Abrahamsaid that, as a minor-
ity student at the University, she
has seen changes Oin the envi-

ronment on campus during her
undergraduate years. She came
to the court to show support
and act as a face for the people
who will be directly affected by
whether or not affirmative action
is reinstated in the state.
"For me, I just understand the
role that affirmative action plays
at the University and the role not
having it plays at the University,"
Abraham said.
Abraham and Washington
listened to the plaintiffs' argu-
ments and said it seemed like the
lawyers spelled out their argu-
ments well.
"I definitely think that the jus-
tices had their biases. It's hard to
tell when you're swaying them,
and when they're combatting
you constructively-or when they
are doing it with malintent,"
Abraham said. "It was difficult
for me to distinguish between
the two so I'm not sure what to
expect."
Washington, a 2012 gradu-
ate, said she was interested in
comments several of the jus-
tices made that might show how
they're swaying on the case.
"There was a lot of back-
and-forth for Sotomayor, who
was standing up for affirmative
action, it was very noticeable
that she was in support of it,"
Washington said. "Kennedy was
asked a lot of questions, which
was interesting. Based on my
research of the case, I wasn't
sure if he was going to be a swing
vote or not. But it seemed like
that could be a likelihood."
A group of students from
Michigan high schools also trav-
eled to Washington, D.C. to dem-
onstrate and march with BAMN.
Markeith Jones, a student at
Lutheran Northwest High
School in Macomb, Mich., said
he organized the trip because he
felt strongly about affirmative
action.
"I took it offensively that they
would try to block minorities
from going to these different
Michigan colleges. I took it per-
sonally," Jones said.
Jones, who is considering
applying to the University, said
he is unsure if he would want to
go to a school that would have a
less diverse student body.


Amnesty: Hundreds killed in
Nigerian military detention

Freed detainees
testify to cruel
treatment, lack of
medical care
LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) - Hun-
* dreds of people are dying in mili-
tary detention from shootings,
suffocation or starvation as Nige-
ria's security forces crack down
on an Islamic uprising in the
northeast, Amnesty International
said Tuesday.
More than 950 people died in
military custody in the first six
months of this year, according
to "credible information" from a
senior Nigerian army officer, the
rights group said.
The Associated Press reported
in August that hundreds of peo-
ple detained by security forces
in northern Nigeria have disap-
peared. The new Amnesty Inter-
national report may help explain
what happened to all those peo-
ple- a horrifying result for their
loved ones who are still searching
for the missing.
Military and government offi-
cials did not immediately respond
to phone calls and emails request-
ing their comments.
If the number of deaths in
military custody cited by the
Amnesty International is accu-
rate, that means Nigeria's mili-
tary has killed more civilians
than the extremists did during
the first half of 2013.
Amnesty International
called for an urgent investiga-
tion.
Detainees "were reportedly

shot in the leg during interroga-
tions, provided no medical care
and left to bleed to death," the
London-based human rights
group said in the report, which
includes testimony from freed
detainees.
The AP reported three months
after President Goodluck Jona-
than declared a state of emer-
gency in the northeastern states
of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe on
May 14 that hundreds of people
were being rounded up in night
raids. The state of emergency
gives a Joint Task Force of sol-
diers, police, intelligence and cus-
toms and immigration officials
the right to detain people and
move them from place to place, as
well as the right to search without
warrants.
Distraught relatives, human
rights organizations and jour-
nalists have asked the army, the
police, intelligence services and
government officials where the
arrested people are, but have
received no answers, the AP
reported.
Amnesty International says
dozens of bodies are being deliv-
ered by soldiers to the mortu-
aries of the main hospitals in
Maiduguri and Damaturu, capi-
tals of Borno and Yobe states.
Human rights activist Shehu
Sani of the northern-based
Civil Rights Congress of Nige-
ria told AP in August that he
believes thousands had been
detained.
Amnesty International said
those killed were detained as
suspected members or associ-
ates of Boko Haram, an armed
Islamic extremist group that has

claimed responsibility for attacks
that have killed hundreds of Mus-
lim and Christian civilians this
year in their mission to overturn
democracy and force Nigeria -
Africa's most populous nation
which is almost equally divided
between the predominantly Mus-
lim north and mainly Christian
south - to become an Islamic
state.
Boko Haram itself routinely
commits human rights abuses,
gunning down schoolchildren,
health workers, government
officials, Christian pastors and
moderate Muslim clerics. In
2009, security forces bombed and
destroyed the Boko Haram head-
quarters in Maiduguri. The sect's
leader, Mohammed Yusuf, was
killed in police custody.
Amnesty International said
most of the deaths it documented
at the hands of security forces
took place at the Presidential
Lodge guardroom and a deten-
tion center in Damaturu, and at
Giwa Military Barracks in Mai-
duguri.
"The details of what happens
behind locked doors in these
shadowy detention facilities must
be exposed, and those responsible
for any human rights violations
brought to book," said Amnesty
International's deputy AfricaI
director, LucyFreeman.
Amnesty International quoted
a second senior army officer as
saying: "Hundreds have been
killed in detention either by
shooting them or by suffocation.
People are crammed into one cell.
There are times when people are
brought out on a daily basis and
killed."

REGENTS TO CONSIDER
CONSTRUCTION OF
TRANSPORTATION
RESEARCH SITE
Pendingthe regents' approval,
the University will move for-
ward on plans to construct a
mobility transformation facility
- a testing ground for automated
and connected vehicles.
The College of Engineering
and the University of Michi-
gan Transportation Research
Institute have proposed the
project in conjunction with the
Michigan Department of Trans-
portation. As part of the col-
laboration, MDOT has provided
grant money to fund part of the
$6.5-mijlion project, the rest
made up by University sources.
The University's Trans-
portation Research" Institute
announced the establishment of
the Michigan Mobility Transfor-
mation Center during a three-
day symposium last May.
The center seeks to implement
new technologies into vehicles
in order to make advancements
in vehicle efficiency and safety.
At a site located off of Huron
Parkway between Plymouth and
Hubbard roads, the University
will construct simulated urban

streets, roads and ramps to
mimic real driving conditions.
To complete the facility, site
modifications will include road
construction, storm water man-
agement and electrical infra-
structure.
In a communication to the
regents, Timothy Slottow, Uni-
versity executive vice president
and chief financial officer, said
design plans are scheduled to
begin immediately with the firm
Mannik & Smith Group.
UNIVERSITY TO AWARD
PROJECT BIDS FOR
MUNGER GRADUATE
RESIDENCE, PENDING
FRIDAY APPROVAL
While demolition has begun
at the site of the planned Munger
Graduate Residence, the regents
will green-light University
administrators to seek construc-
tion bids and award contracts.
The projected is expected
to cost $185 million, funded by .
University Housing resources
and a $100-million gift from
Charles Munger. The Univer-
sity announced Munger's dona-
tion last April and approved the
building's schematic designs last
month. According to the sche-
matic designs, Munger Graduate
Residence will provide housing
for 630 students in seven-bed-
room apartments.
The project is expected to be
completedby the summer of2015.
ATHLETIC CAMPUS TO
OFFICIALLY BE RENAMED

THE STEPHEN M. ROSS
ATHLETIC CAMPUS
Following another record-
breaking private-donation, this
time a $200-million donation
from real-estate mogul Stephen
Ross, the regents will vote to
rename the University's athletic
campus the "Stephen M. Ross
Athletic Campus."
Last month, Ross directed his
$200-million gift to be divided
equally between his namesake
School of Business and the Ath-
letic Department. His donations
to the University have totaled
$313 million - including a $100
million gift that prompted the
University to rename the Busi-
ness School in his honor.
In a communication to the
regents, Slottow and Athletic
Director Dave Brandon said the
name change is "in recognition
of his exceptional gene-sity in
providing the finest facilities to
University of Michigan student-
athletes."
The Stephen M. Ross Athletic
Campus will include Univer-
sity property adjacent to athletic
facilities south of Hoover Street,
between State a'nd Main streets.
Also on the Athletic Campus,
the regents will vote on brand-
ing the Softball Center in honor
of University alum Donald R.
Shepherd, whose donations to
the University have totaled $25
million.

season premiere struggles to
mix these elements, and in the
end, the episode-long storyline
prevails while any attempt at
establishing a longer arc falls
by the wayside.
Season one of "Arrow" ended
on a huge cliffhanger, with
the poor area of the city, the
Glades, exploding and Oliver
Queen (Stephen Amell) escap-
ing his role as The Hood. The
season two premiere deals with
the story of the week follow-
ing the explosion. Those who
lost loved ones take revenge on
those who "simply let it hap-
pen," while Amell focuses on
doing a lot of character work
with Queen. The episode shows
the impact of his best friend
Tommy's death and his inabil-
ity to stop the eruption of the
Glades. Queen hates that his
best friend died thinking of
him as a murderer, leading him
to question his identity as The
Hood. His struggle is one of
the more interesting elements
of the premiere, even if there's
no doubt that Oliver doesn't

Those who saw the theatri-
cal trailer to "Captain Phillips"
this summer should remember
the opening: From beyond the
radar screen, a blip material-
izes. Captain Phillips walks
to the deck to see a small skiff
headed toward his ship. He's
under fire! Now the pirates
have taken over the bridge!
When they are allowed to
speak, the pirates tell the crew
over the telecom "in one min-
ute, I will kill your friend."
So scary! So violent! What I
gathered from this trailer was
that "Captain Phillips" would
be the most dehumanizing
and neglectful treatment of
an overwhelmingly complex
political and economic horror
story that Hollywood could
conceive.
Interestingly, the consensus
among critics is that "Captain
Phillips" provides a nuanced
treatment of the pirates, which
may have come as a surprise
for those who, like me, had
no hopes. Indeed, against all
expectation "Captain Phillips"
does provide some background
to the pirates. But before we
jump into this, let me just state
my case clearly: This is a high-
ly distorted representation of
facts. As with every work of
art ever claiming to be "based
on true events," it is a carefully
selected and constructed "re-
presentation" of these events,
which in this case, actually
happened along the Horn of
Africa in April 2009 and not in
the Mediterranean Sea where it
was re-created in early 2012.
So how then is this film care-
fully selected and constructed,
and more immediately, why
should you not go see this film?
True, there is a 10-minute
scene at the beginning of the
film set in a Somali fishing
village that attempts to pro-
vide some explanation as to
the social and economic world
from which the pirates emerge,
one of impoverishment and
desperation. Later on, there is

No hopeful future
for Tomorrow'

CW recycles story
for unexceptional
'People'
By JOE REINHARD
For the Daily
CW's "The Tomorrow Peo-
ple" offers a look at the future of
humankind, the next evolution-
ary step when
people develop.
unbelievable
superhuman The
abilities. What Tomorrow
it doesn't offer,
unfortunately, People
is anything par- Pilot
ticularly origi-
nal. Despite its Wednesdays
tagline - "Dif- at9 p.m.
ferent is Dan-
gerous" - the CW
series starts off
pretty mundane and safe.
The pilot introduces Stephen
Jameson (Robbie Amell, "1600
Penn") as a teenager going
through changes seemingly
unique to him: He's developing
superpowers. He soon discov-
ers that these powers aren't as
unique as one would initially
think. Turns out he's one of the
Tomorrow People, a .group of
people who mark the next evolu-
tionary step for the human race.
Like the others in this group,
Stephen has a genetic mutation

that gives him powers which
include (and are limited to)
telepathy, telekinesis and tele-
portation.
Now, pilots have a lot going
against them. They have little
time to go over some very impor-
tant information and hook the
viewer, and to this show's credit,
the exposition-laced dialogue
isn't too hard to swallow, and the
action scenes fulfill some sense
of fun. But the show chooses to
enter into well explored terri-
tory, the ever-popular-people-
with-superpowers genre, and so
far it hasn't presented anything
worth noting. Instead of rely-
ing on its own inventive ideas (of
which there are few), it mainly
draws from the inventive ideas
of the past, only to do little with
them. In particular, it borrows
heavily from "The Matrix,"
with what's shaping up to be
the classic Chosen One plotline,
and pretty much rips off "The
X-Men"; only the X-Men are a
little more diverse and excit-
ing when it comes to their super
powers (and-their personalities).
Therein lies the problem with
the characters: They don't leave
the viewer with much of an
impression. Amell as Stephen isn't'
particularly compelling or char-
ismatic, while the rest of the cast,
which includes Mark Pellegrino
("Supernatural") as the cryptic
villain Jedikiah Price, does little
to breathe life into the story. The

unoriginal premise needed strong
characters to make the viewer
especially care, but for now, the
show's just rather bland.
That isn't to say there's no
fun to be had. Fans of the recent
flood of superhero movies will
probably find something to like
here. The decent special effects
lead to enjoyable fight and chase
scenes, while the futuristic
score sets the tone well. From
a plotting standpoint, the show
spends its hour wisely, setting
up a handful of mysteries and
ending on an intriguing note.
If anything, the series has faint
potential.
For now, though, it's hard
to look past the unimagina-
tive opening act. The premise
and characters aren't especially
unique, and what's worse, one
could run by a checklist of pop-
ular sci-fi franchises over the
past 50 years and immediately
spot the multiple similarities.
Granted, this show is a remake
of a British TV program from
the 1970's, so some parallels can
be forgiven. A remake does have
the responsibility of making
itself relevant again, however,
and this show just hasn't done
that - at least not yet.
Until that happens, stick with
the first season of "Heroes"
to get your fix of superpower
action and fun. "The Tomorrow
People" 's future doesn't look
very promising.

'Vanilla Ice Goes Amish,' but

albums, Pearl

far removed
from its early
1990's-megastar glory days,
but it still keeps up a devoted
fanbase through its top-notch
live shows and generally solid
studio albums. After follow-
ing up early success with an
experimental (and some would
say self-sabotaging) mid-career
interlude, Pearl Jam has put out
a seriesof back-to-basics, rock
'n' roll records, of which Light-

Firstly, Lightning Bolt does
not feel like an album that was
recorded in 2013. The band's
love for vinyl and classic rock
shines through in the guitar-
heavy, riff-driven tracks, and
while the anachronistic style
can be off-putting for listeners
wanting something more for-
ward-thinking, those searching
for old-time rock 'n' roll will
find nothing better. Pearl Jam
is still a master at crafting rock
songs and executing them per-
fectly.

The prem-

people do after their 15 minutes

Vanilla Ice seems to have been
working, or at least dabbling, in
the construction field for quite
some time, because when he
helps demo and remodel a kitch-

First off, Vanilla Ice isn't

man we (at least those of us
with a working knowledge of
the 1980's) know as Vanilla Ice
bears the Christian name Rob-

Halloween Wednesdays

Ryan Mur-
phy's wonder- FX
fully weird
anthology series, "American
Horror Story," made its return-
last week. The new iteration,
subtitled "Coven," delves into
the history of witchcraft and
the fictitious witching scene in
New Orleans. Many of "Hor-
ror Story" 's signature actors
are back and joined by excit-
ing newcomers in this wild and
alluring new chapter.
"AHS: Coven" starts out
distinctly and surprisingly
straightforward. Series staples
Jessica Lange ("King Kong")
and Sarah Paulson ("Mud")
play mother and daughter who
both attended Miss Robich-
aux's Academy for Exceptional
Young Ladies. These "excep-
tional young ladies" are, in
fact, witches. Paulson's Corde-
lia Foxx now runs the school,
which has enrollment of four
students including "AHS" alum
Taissa Farmiga ("The Bling
Ring") and Emma Roberts
("We're The Millers"). Kathy
Bates ("Harry's Law") also stars
as Delphine LaLaurie, a real-
life, 19th-century serial killer in

whom Lange's character Fiona
takes a special interest.
It's worth noting that, on
paper, nothing about "Ameri-
can Horror Story" should work.
Dylan McDermott wrestling a
ghost in a leather suit should feel
silly. Lange performing a campy
rendition of "The Name Game"
in the middle of an asylum-set
horror series should make you
cringe. But this is "American
Horror Story," which means
any conventional wisdom does
not apply. Murphy has created a
world so bizarrely and perplex-
ingly enticing that the words
"should" or "shouldn't" don't
exist. Kathy Bates as a histori-
cal character hell-bent on hav-
ing her own real-life Minotaur?
SURE. Just sit back, enjoy and
try not to question why it's so
amazingly compelling. It just is.
In terms of ambition, "Coven"
already feels more "Murder
House" than "Asylum." Where-
as the latter came out guns
blazing from the very start
(Nuns! Mad Scientists! Aliens!),
"Murder House" was arguably
a more subdued saga, focused
on its singular haunted house
storyline. So far, "Coven" seems
to follow "Murder House" 's
delicate footsteps, introducing
one, witches-as-the-oppressed
dramatic narrative. With that
being said, the after-show sea-
son preview suggests that like
"Asylum," "Coven" will get
crowded (Zombies! Franken-
stein!).
Naturally, most of the pre-
miere episode, "Bitchcraft," is
about fleshing out the tone of
the miniseries, which isn't quite
nailed down yet. Though all
three iterations have a distinct
"AHS" feel, "Murder House"
and "Asylum" were able to
establish enough tonal and the-
matic differences to set them
apart from one another. Co-
creator Murphy has described
"Coven" as a lighter series than
its predecessors - he set out to

make it an easier watch than
the exceedingly dark "Asylum."
While the premiere establishes
this feeling a bit, it didn't quite
strike the right balance between
the desired playfulness and the
horror, at times feeling neither,
here nor there.
Regardless, the actors in
"AHS" have consistently out-
shined the series' plot or tone,
and "Coven" is no exception.
Lange continues to deliver a
master-class performance as
a witch determined to defy
the aging pr'ocess. Evan Peters
("Kick Ass") and Farmiga have a
beautiful chemistry together as
strong here as it was in the first
season. It's also no surprise that
Kathy Bates and Angela Bas-
sett ("Olympus Has Fallen") are
perfect in their spellbinding (if
you will) roles as rival sorcer-
esses.
"Bitchcraft" is also one of
the scarier entries in the "AHS"
series. Beginning with a truly
frightening 1830's torture
sequence, followed directly
by the revamped, hair-raising
opening credits, the premiere
doesn't let viewers forget that
this is, as promised, a horror
story.
All in all, "Coven" is a pleas-
ing start for a series that usu-
ally finds its stride somewhere
in the middle. Most of "AHS"
's standout episodes, includ-
ing "Rubber Man" and "Unholy
Night," begin to emerge around
the eighth episode of each
13-episode run. Fans of the
series will no doubt be glued
to their screens, as leads Lange
and Paulson are as mesmerizing
as ever. "Bitchcraft" is a wel-
comed reassurance that three
seasons in, "AHS" hasn't lost
any of its strange mojo. And
judging by some of the sexy
deaths (literally, deaths-by-sex)
in the premiere, it's clear this is
still the disturbing, outrageous,
crazy-good "American Horror
Story" we know and love.

Unfortunately, ABC
its spinoff "Once

to live up to expectations. The
problem isn't that "Wonderland"
can't stand on its own, onlythat its
unoriginality is so obvious.
Plunging the technicolored
splendor of Lewis Carroll's well
known children's story into dark-
er, grittier territory is nothing
new. Tim Burton literally did that
three years ago. And remember
the miniseries "Tin Man," Syfy's

If you agree with this argument,
you should steer clear of The Head

Because of the band's inclusive-

first album gave people the warmth
of music that can be played to fit
all scenarios; songs like "Rivers &
Roads" "Down in the Valley" and
"Cats & Dogs" offer security in the
swelling vocals, the rustic guitar
and the catchy harmonies. The
music is like a hug, a thick fuzzy
blanket or a hot mug of tea for the
head and the heart.
In Let's Be Still, the comfort
has maximized. Songs like "My

1. Michigan badly needs some
help on the offensive line.
The problems on the offensive
line were supposed to be fixed
when redshirt sophomore guard
Chris Bryant replaced redshirt
sophomore center Jack Miller in
the starting lineup against Min-
nesota two weeks ago. Bryant
is bigger, and the move allowed
Graham Glasgow to move from
guard to center, which was
seemingly a better fit for the red-
shirt sophomore.

The switch in the offen-
sive line also allowed for some
stacked formations, where fifth-
year senior tackles Taylor Lewan
and Michael Schofield - Michi-
gan's best offensive linemen -
would line up on the same side of
the ball. .
This was supposed to be the
big, nasty Wolverine offensive
line.
Instead, Michigan was blown
off the ball against Penn State.
The stacked offensive line was
sniffed out and rendered use-
less almost immediately. Bryant
was replaced at one point, while

Lewan left the game at halftime
and never returned due to an
apparent head injury, though
Michigan coach Brady Hoke said
Monday that the injury had more
to do with his hip than anything
else.
Make no mistake, Michigan
lost this game because of its
inability to move the Nittany
Lions off the line of scrimmage.
The run game never got going,
which completely halted the
passing game.
Hoke said that Lewan will
play against Indiana next week,
but if the undisclosed symp-
toms of the apparent head injury

don't fix themselves shortly, the
already struggling offensive line
is going to be in a world of hurt.
2. Michigan's offense isn't
anything without a running game.
This, too, ties into the strug-
gles of the offensive line, because
if the holes were bigger, the
running game would be much
improved.
But without halfback produc-
tion, Michigan's offense is going
to be difficult to watch the rest of
the year.

Meanwhile, in R ochser.

Atcthe same moment, 200
miles apart, the Michi-
gan football and hockey
teams were finding out what
kind of team they would be. At
Penn State,
the foot-
ball team's
52-yard field
goal had just'
fallen short to '
send its game,
once seem-
ingly in hand, ZACH
into overtime. HELFAND
At the
same time,
the Michigan
hockey team had justblown its
own four-goal lead in Rochester,
N.Y. With the football game des-
tined for late drama, few Michi-
gan fans were paying attention to
this early-season hockey game.
But as the football team strug-
gled with its identity - should
they run late behind a besieged
line? Pass and risk a turnover?
Would they gamble or play it
safe? - the hockey team was
findingsomething about its own.
The Wolverines had just
made a statement in their season
opener against Boston College
earlier in the week. Now, up 4-0
over Rochester Institute of Tech-
nology after just 20 minutes, "we
kind of thought we were on top
of the world," said senior forward
Derek DeBlois.
The puck dropped for the sec-
ond period at 8:03 p.m. At that
exact moment in Happy Valley,
the football team began its drive
with 4:18 remaining in the game.
For both teams, the nightmare
was about to begin.
For the hockey team, it came
by way of penalties and turnovers
and defensive-zone breakdowns.
Michigan was "demolished," said
senior defenseman Mac Bennett.
With a minute to go in the second
period, the lead had disappeared.

they never knew whatthey were
goingto get from the goaltender.
Last year, DeBlois and Copp said,
RIT would've been a loss.
"We're still answering ques-
tions from last year," Berenson
said.
But the feeling is already dif-
ferent this year. Bennett thought
the team needed to be closer, so
he made sure teammates were
playing paintball together, going
to the movies together, having
barbecues and dinner. Tuesday
night, a few guys on the team
went to the Red Wings game
together.
The win over Rochester meant
very, very little. The team knows
that. But Bennett felt something
as the team left the arena Satur-
day night.
He tried to describe that on
Tuesday. As Bennett spoke, lie sat
in the big armchair at Yost. He
rested an ankle on his knee. In
this pose, with his arms resting
against the chair, the senior and
captain looked almost grandfa-
therly. He struggled to articulate
what he knew about his team
after two games.
"I don't think we have an
identity quite yet," he said, after
a moment.
Before he spoke about what he
felt after the game, he thought
for several more seconds. When
he began, he spoke-slowly and
thoughtfully. In his pose and dic-
tion, he resembled - eerily, but
yes, it was there - his coach.
"If we want to get something
done, all ittakes for us to say is
'Alright, we need to go do it,' and
actually go out to do the work to
do it," Bennett said. "And it really
showed in that third period,
and it was something that I was
really, really proud of."

It was 4-4.
Michigan scored a late goal in
the second period and walked
into the locker room. Outside, a
crowd of 10,556 - close to twice
the size of Yost Ice Arena - had
turned frenzied. Nine freshmen
had made the trip. Together, in
the locker room, they waited.
The Wolverines had been here
before. A year ago, in the season
opener, Michigan went up 3-0
against RIT in the first period.
Then RIT tied the game in the
third. The Wolverines were
stunned. They'would lose just 14
seconds into overtime.
From there, the season spi-
raled downward. Michigan won
the next night against RIT, but
would soon fall below .500 and
never recover. After blowing
the chance to sweep on opening
night, the Wolverines wouldn't
sweep a series until February.
A lack of resiliency dogged the

team.
Now, in Rochester, Michigan
coach Red Berenson entered the
room.
"He was angry -for good rea-
son," Bennett said after practice
Tuesday. "And he kind of gave it
to us."
"A year ago," Bennett contin-
ued, "if they tie a game and it's
4-4, I'm not sure we're winning
that game."
In fact, that sentiment was a
theme for the day. Before Ben-
nett, senior forward Derek DeB-
lois and then sophomore forward
Andrew Copp each, unprompted,
said different versions of the
same thing: "We would've had
guys doubting whether we were
going to win that game," Copp
said.'
In the locker room Saturday,
after Berenson finished his dia-
tribe, the teamsat.there. Two
hundred miles south, Michigan

and Penn State had just entered
overtime. In Rochester, play-
ers said, the locker- room had a.
strange vibe. Nobody panicked.
Nobody doubted, Bennett,
DeBlois and Copp all said inde-
pendently and unprompted on .
Tuesday.
When the third period started,
senior defenseman Kevin Clare
blocked a shot. So did junior for-
ward Zach Hyman.
"All these guys were stepping
up out of nowhere and will do
anything for each guy in that
locker room," DeBlois said.
At 9:18 p.m., freshman for-
ward Tyler Motte scored his first
career goal,just as Penn State
scored a touchdown in quadruple
overtime to end the game. The
hockey team now led 6-4, and
would soon add a seventh goal.
Afterward, Copp said, his
teammates told him matter-of-
factly they never actually thought

they'd lose.
On Tuesday, Berenson sat in
the big armchair in the room
Michigan uses for interviews
at Yost Ice Arena. He rested his
arms on the cushions and spoke
deliberately and softly about a
team building its own personal-
ity over the 40-plus games ina
season. ,
"You're building the profile,"
Berenson said. "It's not like
you're waiting to see it come out
and it's a final product. It's never
a final product, but at least you'll
see glimpses."
The stigma of last year's fail-
ure to reach the NCAA Tourna-
ment still hangs over this team.
Bennett mentions "last year" so
often, he now apologizes for it.
Last year, Bennett said, the
team was never close-knit until
the end, when they made a des-
perate run for a tournament
berth. Last year, Berenson said,

Eckenrode guides 'M'
to upset over Creighton

By JEREMY SUMMITT
DailySportsEditor
Something the Michigan hock-
ey team lacked last season was a
true, No. 1 goaltender. Thanks to
an 8-1-1 record in his last 10 games
last year, sophomore Steve Racine
earned the start-
ingjob and hasn't NOTEBOOK
diverted much
from the late-season rally.
In the Wolverines' 7-4 win at
Rochester Institute of Technol-
ogy on Saturday, Racine posted a
career-high 42 saves on 46 shots.
Michigan coach Red Berenson said
he was the best player on the ice
that night.
Even though Racine had been
named the starter in the weeks
leading up to the season opener,
Berenson didn't know how long
that would last. He went as far as
saying Racine could be the top
option for a week or for the entire
season, but changes would arise if
needed.
Senior defenseman Mac Bennett
said the team has full confidence
in Racine, but Berenson wasn't so
quick to place his goaltender on a
pedestal.
"Obviously he's got off to a good
start, so, good for him," Berenson
said. "I think that's just a confi-
dence builder. I don't think you're
ever set unless he wins 10 games in
a row, and you can say he can't get
any better than this."
Racine came into last season
recovering fromhip surgery, which
meant he wasn't fully conditioned
by the season opener. Because of
the setback, Racine could hardly
garner any momentum in the times
he received the starting nod.
Racine says he worked harder
than ever this summer to get back
in shape and continue to get bet-
ter. The early results are promis-
ing, and his process to get there
hasn't slowed down. Racine has
already stayed after practice mul-
tiple times to work with goalten-
der coach Josh Blackburn on small
changes he can make between the
pipes.
"At the end of the year, he got
some confidence and he got some
momentum," Berenson said. "He
got established a little bit and had
a better summer, and he's coming
back as a number one now. It's his

job to lose."
FRESHMAN CLASS COMING
TOGETHER: Michigan's success
will continue to depend on how
well the 10-man freshman class
progresses throughout the year.
Multiple upperclassmen have men-
tioned that this freshman class is
one of the most mature they have
seen in their time at Michigan.
Whether through maturity or raw
talent, four of those freshmen have
made their mark by registering at
least one point in the first two reg-
ular-season games.
"The freshmen have been step-
ping into big roles early, and they've
all been playing great hockey," said
senior forward Derek DeBlois.
Freshmen forwards Alex Kile
and#JT Compher have each seen
time on the first line with DeBlois
and sophomore Andrew Copp,
gaining valuable experience from
the two alternate captains.
"I like playing with them
because they. show great leader-
ship, and they're two of our better
offensive players, I'd say," Kile said.
"It was an honor just to be recog-
nized and put on their line."
In the defensive zone, freshmen
Mike Downing and Nolan de Jong
have played significant roles on the

penalty kill, allowing the opposi-
tion just an 18-percent conversion
rate. Senior captain Mac Bennett
has openly expressed how smart a
player de Jong is, and that he really
loves being paired with him on the
blue line.
GUPTILL'S BACK : After missing
the first two games due to a sus-
pension for off-ice issues, junior
forward Alex Guptill made his
return to the lineup against RIT.
With two assists - one coming in
his first shift - his offensive pres-
ence was felt immediately.
"He's a leader up front in terms
of the points we need," Bennett
said. "In his first shift, he popped
in an assist so that has to be huge
for his confidence."
Guptill was paired on the fourth
line with freshman Evan Allen and
juniorTravis Lynch inwhatBeren-
son called a test to see if Guptill
was conditioned enough to play at
game speed. He was forced to miss
over a week of preseason practice,
too, because of the suspension.
But thanks to a number of spe-
cial-teams situations; Guptill also
received time on the first line with
DeBlois and Copp, where he'll like-
ly play this weekend when Michi-,

After a disappointing loss to
PennState onFridaythe Mich-
igan men's soccer team (1-2-2
Big Ten, 5-4-3 overall) came
up big Tuesday night. Late in
the sec-
ond half, CREIGHTON 0
with the MICHIGAN 1
game
destined for extra time, fresh-
man defender Lars Eckenrode
guided home a corner kick to
give the Wolverines a 1-0 vic-
tory against No. 12 Creighton.
This was Michigan's first
win against a ranked team this
year after losses to No. 2 Notre
Dame and No.7 Northwestern.
"We played well," said
Michigan head coach Chaka
Daley, referring to those loss-
es. "But gave away goals at the
wrong times."
From the start of the game,
Michigan's attack looked
dangerous. In the third min-
ute, junior midfielder Mar-
cos Ugarte played a ball into
the path of sophomore for-
ward James Murphy that
was deflected by a Creighton
defender. The ball landed at
the feet of redshirt sophomore
Colin McAtee, whose shot
went high and wide.'
As the half progressed, the
Blue Jays' (6-4-2 overall) pres-
sure intensified, as they kept
the majority of possession.
Despite keeping the ball for
long periods of time, Michigan
was able to catch Creighton on
multiple counterattacks that
were thwarted by Creighton
goalkeeper Alex Bolowich.
In the 34th minute, sopho-
more forward James Murphy's
shot was blocked by a Blue Jay
defender and the ball landed
at senior midfielder Fabio
Pereira's foot. What looked
like a certain goal was saved
by Bolowich, who had eight
saves on the day.
"We didn't gift any chances
to Creighton," Daley said "We
kept it solid in the back."

f 1

Redshirt junior goaltender Adam Grinwis made three saves Tuesday.

The Wolverines' back line
played a stellar game. The
unit allowed a potent Blue Jay
attack just three shots on goal
and kept scoring opportunities
to a minimum throughout the
game.
"We stayed with (our) men
and focused on clearances,"
Eckenrode said. "We didn't
allow them any space."
The Blue Jays' best chance
of the game came in the 28th
minute after a brief rain show-
er. Creighton junior forward
Zabarle Kollie stole the ball
from Eckenrode in the mid-
field and quickly passed the
ball to sophomore midfielder
Timo Pitter. Pitter, on a break-
away with only the goalkeeper
to beat, slipped on the wet
field, allowing the Wolverine's
defense to recover and clear
the ball.
After the intermission,
Michigan brought on fresh-
man forward Yamann Sahlool

and switched to a more attack-
ing style of play. Immedi-
ately after entering the game,
Sahlool made an impact. After
latching onto a pass from
Pereira in the 78th minute,
Sahlool made his way into the
box and forced a one-on-one
save from Bolowich with the
'game still scoreless.
"(Sahlool) is always a dan-
ger," Daley said. "He's always
a threat."
The breakthrough for the
Wolverines came in the 77th
minute.
Pereira whipped in acorner
that landed at the feet of Eck-
enrode who shot the ball past
the oncoming Creighton goal-
keeper, giving him his first
career goal and the Wolver-
ines a 1-0 lead.
This marked the first time
Michigan has beaten a ranked
team at home since last Octo-
ber, when the Wolverines beat
Akron 1-0 in overtime.

Gardner's propensity to give the
ball away, Borges stopped giving
him the opportunities to do so.
Time after time, it was Toussaint
with the ball going nowhere and
Gardner standing in the back-
field like a decoy.
The offense stopped moving,
and the game eventually went to
Penn State.
If Borges and Hoke.would
rather keep pushing a run game
that was clearly going nowhere
than give the ball to their best
offensive player, there's a prob-
lem there. At some point, Michi-
gan is going to have to figure out
whether Gardner is better suited
runningthe ball 20 times agame
than throwing the ball into the
hands of defenses, which he has
done more times than anyone
else in the country.
With the offensive line strug-
gling and the running game put
on hold, this is Gardner's offense
to make do with. Understand-
ably, Hoke and Borges aren't
ready for that, and it shows.
4. In Gardner's defense, who is
he throwing to?
Michigan's second-best wide
receiver is a converted tight end
that dropped two passes in the
end zone against Penn State.
The tight end, sophomore Devin

Funchess, ended up having a
productive day with four catch-
es for 112 yards and two touch-
downs, but the point stands. .
The best Wolverine wide
receiver is fifth-year senior Jer-
emy Gallon, who has 31 catches
on the year. Funchess has 19.
Their 50 combined catches is 10
more than the rest of the team
combined, which has totaled 40
catches.
Those two can't do it them-
selves, and neither can Gard-
ner. Michigan's wideouts were
thought to be a problem before
the season, but nothing this bad.
Losing redshirt freshman wide
receiver Amara Darboh before
the year was obviously a big
blow, but it's time for someone
not named Funchess or Gallon
to start making an impact.
Bold Prediction: Hoke's home
winning streak will end this sea-
son.
In his third year as coach,
Hoke still hasn't lost a home
game in 18 tries, but that streak
is going to end soon. With the
way the offense has been play-
ing and three tough Big Ten
games on the docket (Indiana,
Nebraska and Ohio State), Hoke
won't end 2013 undefeated in
Ann Arbor.

After he missed the exhibi-

m ich iga n d aily What would Michigan rely on?
After six games, Michigan is,

a team without an identity. The
offense isn't sure what it is. The
line was blown off the ball for
much of the game. Even with
Gardner extending drives with
the scramble, the Wolverines
still finished with 2.8 yards per
attempt on the ground against
Penn State. Fifth-year senior
running back Fitzgerald Tous-
saint finished Saturday with 27
yards on 27 attempts, the low-
est yardage for a back with that

according to Andy Reid of Rivals.
com.
At times, the passing game has
been a force. Gardner completed
15 passes against Penn State for
240 yards and three touchdowns.
But constant turnovers make
throwing the ball a dicey propo-
sition. Gardner had three more of
those Saturday.
With about 90 seconds
remaining, Michigan had the
ball within field-goal range on
the Penn State 27-yard line after
nine straight runs chewed tp
the clock. Score a field goal here,
or geta first down, and it would
render moot any late heroics
from Robinson or Penn State
quarterback Christian Hack-
enberg. It was third-and-9 and
Michigan faced a choice: go for
the kill with a pass, or call a'run
and risk a 44-yard field goal.
The Wolverines hesitated and
sent in the wrong play. Instead of
calling a timeout, Michigan took
a delay of game penalty. Instead
of passing, Michigan called.
another run and lost another
three yards. The 44-yard field
goal became 52. Instead of risk-

ing that, Michigan called a pooch
punt, which netted 15 yards.
The problem was, the defense,
in its own way, is still looking to
define itself. It's close, but not
yet a defensive juggernaut, like
Michigan State, because the
defense is incapable of generating
big negative plays. The defense
has bailed out the team more
than once, but it is too young to
be consistently dominant.
Penn State drove 80 yards
in 29 seconds and made it look
easy. Yet Michigan still had a
chance to win before overtime.
Gardner threw 25 yards to Gal-
lon. Though Gallon stepped out
of bounds with eight seconds left,
Gardner spiked the ball, wast-
ing a second. Gardner completed
another pass for five yards. Now
seven seconds remained.
But even the coaching staff
suffered from an identity crisis
against Penn State. Through
more than two years, Michigan
coach Brady Hoke has estab-
lished a style of aggression. If
he erred, he'd doit going for a
fourth down instead of punting,
going for the win instead of the
tie. But when Michigan had the
chance to ice the game for good,
it turned to a running game that
was doomed as soon as the play
call came in.
"We had all.kinds of oppor-
tunities at every position," Hoke
said. "As coaches we had oppor-
tunities. And we all, we're in this
together, and we all have to make
sure that we're taking advantage
and executing when those oppor-
tunities come."
Each time those opportunities

came, Michigan looked timid. On
a team still searching for its core
competency, apprehension ruled
as the game hung in the balance.
Against Notre Dame two years
ago, with eight seconds remain-
ing, Hoke had opted for one more
chance to win the game. He
called a long fade to the end zone.
Roy Roundtree caught the pass
with two ticks left.
Now, with seven seconds
remaining, Hoke called for a
52-yard field goal. Fifth-year
senior kicker Brendan Gibbons's
try was true, but short.
In overtime, the Wolverines
had to choose again: would they
risk the pass or play for the field
goal with the ineffective rushing
game? Offensive coordinator Al
Borges called nine runs com-
pared to five passes in the four
overtime periods. Bad luck, too,
plagued the team: Michigan had
a 40-yard field goal blocked, and
Gibbons - usually automatic -
missed a 33-yard field goal to the
left.
Yet the Wolverines never
threatened the end zone. In the
third overtime, Frank Clark
jumped on a Penn State fumble.
Michigan just needed points, any
points, to win and stay unbeaten.
Yet on third-and- 1 before the
missed 33-yard attempt, the
offense couldn't pick upa yard
with a Toussaint rush up the
middle.
Penn State won the game with
an authoritative decision. Faced
with fourth-and-l, needing a
field goal to tie, Penn State coach
Bill O'Brien didn't waver.
"I felt like it was time for

somebody to win the game,"
O'Brien said. "We could sit here
and trade field goals all day. I
think eventually it was time for
somebody to win the game, and
I had the opportunityto do it. I
felt like it was time to go for the
win."
The Nittany Lions converted,
and four plays later, they found
the end zone. The players
swarmed victorious running
back Bill Belton in the corner of
the field. Nearby, Gibbons walked
past the celebration alone, hel-
met in hand. He inhaled and let
out an animated breath.
For awhile, Gardner didn't
move. He looked up, hand on his
chin, no expression on his face.
"It hurts," Gardner said after
the game.
"Lose in overtime, if you let it
take a toll, it will," Hoke said.
And now Michigan stares at a
crossroad.
The conference is weak
enough that every team left on
the schedule is beatable, even
Ohio State. Yet there are no easy
games from here on out, begin-
ning was a pesky Indiana team
next week.
For a5-1 team, Michigan
teeters close to the edge. It had
hoped to come into this atmo-
sphere and forge an identity from
a messy but victorious string
of early games. Instead, what
emerged from the white sea of
Beaver Stadium is a team as con-
fused as ever.

Redemption at State College Back to basics

By JUSTIN MEYER
Daily Sports Writer
On a rainy Sunday in State
College, the No. 19 Michigan
women's soccer team erased a
heartbreaking 2012 tournament
loss, a 12-game winless streak
at Penn State and 11 years of his-
tory when '
senior for- MICHIGAN 1
ward Nkem PENN STATE 0
Ezurike
crossed the ball to senior mid-
fielder Tori McCombs.
McCombs fended off a defend-
er in front of the net to corral
the ball and sent a shot past the
keeper. The goal earned the Wol-
verines (4-1-1BigTen,10-2-1over-
all) a 1-0'win against No. 11 Penn
State and their first-ever victory
in Happy Valley.
The game also marked the
women's soccer program's first
win over Penn State (4-2-0, 10-3-
0) in 11 years, though Michigan
settled for several draws recently,
including a loss in penalties at last
year's Big Ten Tournament.
"I think we all knew we
were going to put one of them
in," McCombs said. "The way
we were beating their outside
defenders, and the way Nkem
and (freshman) Madi Lewis and
(sophomore) Corrine Harris were
going to the goal, we just knew."
Michigan coach Greg Ryan
said the way to beat Penn State
has always been to counterat-
tack because of its offensive skill
and aggressiveness. The Nit-
tany Lions have won the Big.Ten
charmpionship for 15 consecutive
years with this brand of reckless
offense, often sending eight play-
ers forward.
"Penn State was already frus-
trated with us, because last year
they tied us twice," Ryan said.
"They had made statements in
the press like, 'We need to come
out and make a statement against
Michigan.' They wanted to put
five or six goals up on us. It opens
up opportunities for you to score,
but you've got to withstand the
pressure of so many people com-

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
It's pretty evident that the
Michigan football team has
relied more on the ground game
since redshirt junior quarter-
back Devin Gardner has shown
his turnover N
problem with
his arm.
So, that means it's time to give
the majority of carries to... Gard-
ner?
Against Penn State last week-
end, Gardner took on the role as
lead rusher.
Fifth-year senior running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint ran
for a measly 27 yards on 27 car-
ries, as opposed to Gardner's 121
yards.
"I don't like it, but you do what
you have to do to win the game,"
said offensive coordinator Al
Borges. "End of discussion. If
nobody's getting any yards, then
you've got a problem."
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
denied that Gardner running the
ball had anything to do with the
fear of interceptions - rather, he
wanted to force Penn State to use
up all of its timeouts.
Hoke made sure to reiterate
gthe point Gardner is not kept on
a shortleash because of his arm.
. But after Gardner had 24 car-
ries against the Nittany Lions,
there are discussions about how
realistically sustainable that is,
especially given the concerns
that running could put him in
a position where he could get
injured.
"I don't think it's wise to have
Devin take more hits," Hoke
said. "Who's going to play quar-
terback ithe takes all those hits?"
When freshman Shane Mor-
ris's name was offered as a pos-
sible replacement for Gardner
should he become injured, Hoke
immediately brushed it off and
became defensive.
"You have to be conscious
enough about the team," he said.
"And (Gardner's) had 10 starts,
right? 10 starts. He has improved

every week."
STRIBLING SPECULATIONS:
In a game like the one against
Penn State, it's easy to wonder
if the Wolverines might still be
undefeated entering the midway
point of their season had things
been done differently.
But had freshman defen-
sive back Channing Stribling
jumped about half an inch high-
er, it's extremely likely the game
wouldn't have been thrust into
four overtimes.
Stribling was a fingertip away
from breaking up a 36-yard pass
from Penn State quarterback
Christian Hackenberg to wide
receiver Allen Robinson dur-
ing the Nittany Lions' drive to
tie the game with 27 seconds
remaining.
Stribling is a name that has
repeatedly come up when dis-
cussing Michigan's secondary.
In spite of the miscue Sat-
urday, defensive coordinator
Greg Mattison said he's usually
impressed with Stribling in prac-
tice Stribling is usually the one
breaking up passes and making
big plays during practice. Hoke
agreed.
"He's come on," Hoke said. "If
there's anybody I would want
back there, I'll be real honest,
in the secondary to make the
interception, it would be Strib.
We wanted to get him in the
game because of exactly what we
asked him to do."
RYAN REPORT OVER: Satur-
day officially ended any guesses
about when redshirt junior Jake
Ryan would make his season
debut after tearing his anterior
cruciate ligament last spring. '
Ryan dressed, took to the
field and made his presence felt
almost immediately after he
stuffed a Penn State 4th-and-1
near the beginning of the first
quarter.
"I don't think there were any
ill effects," Hoke said. "I think he
ended up playing 31 or 32 plays. It
was great to have him out there.
I think he brings something to
our team."

Bucklin, who made seven saves

Ryan said that every game in

Neurotransmitters are released
from neurons and cause cascad-
ing effects throughout the body,
resulting in symptoms like muscle
contraction or hormone releases.
When a neurotransmitter, like
serotonin, is released from a neu-
ron, it exists in the space between
the releasing neuron and the
receiving neuron as it searches
for the receptors that will allow
it to cause a specific effect. After
interacting with the receptors, it is
removed to avoid an overwhelming
and exaggerated response. Trans-

the releasing neuron, eliminating it
from the space where it could cause
a cascade.

Dear Unnamed Woman with child,
(I am still painting you!)
When I was younger I found it difficult
to understand that my artwork could not
be seamlessly translated from my mind
onto the piece of paper or canvas that was
before me. I had trouble accepting that
something always got lost in translation.
Poetry and writing were no less risky;
even if I did manage to put my thoughts on
to the page in the right way, the meaning
of my work would inevitably vary from
reader to reader. I cannot forget the
frustration I felt one day in eighth grade
when, after readinga poem out loud to my
English class, a classmate raised his hand
and said, "Yeah ... what was that about?"
Nowadays, I find myself with an even
greater challenge: explaining a piece of art
that I myself have not fully given meaning
to.
It is a simple acrylic painting no bigger
than two and a half feet in length and
two feet in width. It sits high up on our
mantel in the dining room, half-finished
as it has been for two years now. It began
on a long weekend when I was 15.I had
been sorting through a vast collection
of National Geographic magazines in

our bookshelves when I came across an
article called "A Life Revealed." There
she was. A woman named Sharbat Gula
who had been photographed in 1985 in a
Pakistan refugee camp. The cover photo
that captured her haunting green eyes is
iconic. But the issue I picked up was more
recent: it was from 2002, the photographer
had gone back and photographed her 17
years later. The photos I saw of her were
startling, she looked as though she had
seen things well beyond her years. She
was still as sinister and striking as she had
been in her first photo but she had lost her
innocence. Ihad to paint her.
The painting that now sits in my dining
room has elicited many responses from
guests. Many don't understand it. Others
are startled by its religiosity. When they
look to me for an explanation, I can only
throw up my hands and tell them to make
what they will of it. It is the face of Sharbat
Gula, only she has a golden crown and she
is holding a child dressed in white. They
have halos surrounding them.
When I describe it now it sounds
undoubtedly religious, though I had
never intended for it to be such a strong
statement. I had only meant to paint her
face. The addition of the religious element

was an afterthought. It was simply meant translation of our art is not altogether a

Invisible Women
by Alicia Adamczyk

statement on the street: How do you recharge during midterms?
Son the record

bile visiting a women's prison in
1989 to produce a video for the
inmates and their children, Art
& Design Prof. Carol Jacobsen was struck by
what she saw - or rather, what she didn't see.
The women in the prison - many serving
life sentences - weren't violent, career crimi-
nals or drug-addicts as popular culture would
have Jacobsen believe. Rather, they were
often victims themselves, mistreated by the
society that had sent them away.
Following that visit in 1989, Jacobsen cre-
ated the Michigan Women's Justice & Clem-
ency Project, an organization that works to
free womenin prison convicted ofmurder but
who acted in self-defense against an abuser.
In 2000, according to statistics from the
United States Justice Department, 25 percent
of women said they were raped and/or physi-
cally assaulted by a current or former spouse,
cohabiting partner or date at some point in
their lifetime. That's one in four - which
equates to roughly 3,222 female undergradu-
ates out of the 12,889 enrolled at the Univer-
sity duringFall 2012.
Broken bones and bruised skin are, unfor-
tunately, not the end of the story. Women
.tj disproportionately affected by domestic
abuse, accounting for 85 percent of the vic-
tims of intimate partner violence. The aver-
age prison sentence for men who kill their
intimate partners is two to six years; for the
women who kill their partners, the average
sentence is 15 years. Approximately 90 per-
cent of women in prisons in the United States
have been victims of domestic or intimate
partner violence.
For the Michigan Women's Justice &
Clemency Project, and Jacobsen, these are
statistics in need of change.
"I discovered who the so-called 'murder-
ers' are in our U.S. women's prisons," Jacob-
sen said of her first visit to the prison. "Most
(women) acted for their own survival, and I
was shocked and hooked for good."
Jacobsen began working with Lynn
D'Orio, an Ann Arbor-based criminal and
family attorney, in 1994 and the two began
visiting women in prison and writing clem-
ency petitions to free some of them.
So far, they, and a slew of rotating volun-
teers and interns, have helped secure the
freedom of nine women who would other-
vise have served life sentences. In the first
week of October this year, they sent 10 peti-
tions to Gov. Rick Snyder to help women in
similar situations.
- Writing a petition to the government can
take months. Jacobsen and her team meet

with women whose cases have a chance to be
petitioned, or those that offer clear evidence
of domestic abuse and that the abuse played
a factor in the crime. They then collect medi-
cal and court records, previous petitions and
even letters from family members, attesting
to the character of the women.
Victoria Adams, a graduate student in the
School of Public Health, interned for the proj-
ect over the summer to gain experience in
legal advocacy for victims of sexual assault.
She helped Jacobsen research and interview
the 10 women whose petitions were sent to
Lansing.
Beyond the resiliency of the women she
met, Adams said the most surprising aspects
of working with the project were the incon-

and Awareness Center, said while there's no
definitive answer to the question, a lack of
resources and support is almost certainly at
the heart of the issue.
"For women who have killed their part-.
ners, because they're in imminent threat of
their lives, that is so many times the resort
that they came to because there were no other
options, because the 'system failed them,"
Rider-Milkovich said.
Fortunately, the system has improved.
Over the last 40years, Michigan state law has
attempted to address domestic abuse in sup-
portive and responsive ways. This includes
the creation of shelters as well as the pass-
ing of various laws - including legalizingthe
use of deadly force to protect oneself from an

"It's sexism. Plain and
simple. Women aren't
supposed to be violent, but
there are violent women."
- Attorney Lynn D'Orio
Michigan Women's Justice and Clemancy Project

in the state Sentencing Guidelines that would
allow previous domestic abuse to be taken
into consideration to help mitigate the pun-
ishment.
"They look for all the bad marks and
don't look for anything that might explain
it," D'Orio said of the current guidelines.
"Self-defense law needs to be changed or
additional instructions should be given to
juries."
Rider-Milkovich recommends a pre-
ferred-arrest policy in place of the current
mandatory arrest policy. Under the current
policy, the abuser or the victim of abuse
can be arrested, and often police will arrest
both parties if it is not absolutely clear who
is at fault.
A preferred-arrest policy would fix this
problem, according to professionals like
Rider-Milkovich, because police would have
more discretion on who to arrest, if anyone.
As Rider-Milkovich explained, the abuser
in the vast majority of domestic abuse situa-
tions is the male partner.
She also recommends the implementa-
tion of more women's shelters and courses
in prison.
While she agrees that the state law has
made significant strides in recent years,
Rider-Milkovich said there are still many
women in prison for crimes committed
before the legal system caught up.
"We can feel really good about the prog-
ress we've made as a society and it's easy to
forget those women who were left behind in
the system ... because they're in prison and.
they're away from our minds and away from
our sight," Rider-Milkovich said. "Itends up
impacting women who are invisible to us as
a society."
For now, the futures of the 10 women
Jacobsen submitted petitions for are all but
certain.
"We are grateful that Governor (Jenni-
fer) Granholm granted as many clemencies
as she did, and angry that they were so few,
so politically safe and so racially unfair,"
Jacobsen said. "We hope that Governor Sny-
der will support clemency for more women
who did not receive fair trials based on the
facts of their cases."
Granholm could not be reached for com-
ment.
D'Orio is hopeful that the Snyder admin-
istration will offer more support for the
project than previous administrations,
though she admits she has no idea how.the
scene will play out.
"We're showing the governor a person-
alized story and saying 'This person's life
should be spared,' " she said. "That's a lot of
work."

"I go on YouTube and I'll
watch videos ... Jenna
Marbles, and whatever is
popular at the moment. Or
I'll go on Instagram."

sistencies and unfairness she encountered in
the legal system. The discrepancies in convic-
tion rates served as a wake-up call.
"I think a lot of times (the judges) see
themselves in the men who are involved in
the crime, or just the men in general," she
said. "I think knowing (the victim) might be
what leads them to much higher conviction
in women, and much more leniency in men."
D'Orio, who acts as the legal director for
the project, explained the discrepancy more
bluntly.
"It's sexism. Plain and simple," D'Orio said.
"Women aren't supposed to be violent, but
there are violent women."
But what would drive a woman to kill her
partner? Holly Rider-Milkovich, the director
of the University's Sexual Assault Prevention

attempted sexual assault and banning mari-
tal rape - and better education for police offi-
cers, judges and legislators on how to handle
a domestic-abuse situation.
Rider-Milkovich said the number of
women imprisoned for killing their abusers
has decreased dramatically during the same
period, with women escaping an abusive rela-
tionship in non-violent ways.
But according to the project, there is much
more to be done. Jacobsen and D'Orio believe,
the state should provide more resources to
domestic abuse victims, as well as women in
prison. They also recommend Michigan insti-
tute a Habeas law like one on the books in
California which would allow abused women
to apply for special clemency.
D'Orio specifically advocates for a change

An 18-foot-long oarfish was found by a marine
science instructor off the coast of Southern
California this weekend. According to CBS
News, oarfish live at depths of more than
3,000 feet, making them difficult to study. The
fish was already dead when discovered.
