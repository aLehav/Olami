morning dispute

When the University's
basketball team beat Michigan
State Sunday afternoon, the
energy inside the Crisler Center
was unmatched. But for University
students standing outside in
line several hours earlier, the
atmosphere was a little different.
Controversy arose early Sunday
morning over the formation of
two different lines for first-come,
first-served student seating.
One line formed at the student
gate at around 6:45 a.m. and was
composed of students who were
part of a pre-line at Kipke Drive
that formed around 5 a.m. The
second, was formed by a member
of Maize Rage, converged in the
parking lot of Crisler between 7:00
and 7:30 a.m.
At 7:30 a.m., Crisler security
guards told the first line to move
to the back of the Maize Rage line,
whichstudents in the first line
objected to since they had been
waiting outside longer. Maize
Rage is the student organization

dedicated to creating a prominent
fan base for the basketball team.
LSA freshman Josh Deyoung,
who arrived at Kipke at 4 a.m.
and was part of the first line, said
there was a lack of communication,
between the two lines at the
beginning ofthe process.
"We waited probably for 15
minutes right by the gate, where
precedent was set that you line
up and at that point there were
rumblings behind us of, 'Hey, this
isn't the line, there's a secondary
line back there," Deyoung said.
University Police were
called in around 7:30 a.m. It's
unconfirmed who called them,
though representatives for Maize
Rage and the University Athletic
Department both said they were
not the responsible for the call.
Police directed students to
either move to the back of the
line or leave the property, adding
that they would be arrested for
trespassing if they stayed where
they were.
No students ended up being
arrested, University Police said.
Following the police announce-
ment, most students moved to the
Maize Rage line but 119 students
who remained in the first line were
brought into the visiting football
team's locker room by Associate

Residents of West Quad's
Winchell Hall walked out of a
Quad Council meeting after a
dispute regarding the new house
rotating policy for dining hall
meals. The decision went into
effect two days prior to increase
social opportunities, but the
resulting need to change dining
halls several times a week was a
point of contention for students.
A solution was later proposed
allowing students to change din-
ing halls less frequently, result-
ing in co-ed dinners only once
or twice per semester. After the
motion was defeated, the men of
Winchell House exited in protest.

Percy Danforth, known as
"master of the bones," played his
unique instrument in the Michi-
gan Union.
Danforth created music with
two 3- to 4-inch rib bone-shaped
pieces of wood, holding the wood
pieces between his fingers with
one "bone" against the heel of his
hand and allowing the others to
swing back and forth, resulting in
a unique clacking rhythm.
Danforth ended his perfor-
mance with a brief explanation
of the genre of ragtime music,
where the use of musical bones
became popular.

Three University basketball
players were caughtstealingfrom
the Ann Arbor Dairy Mart. Ray
Jackson, Jimmy Iing and Chris
Fields stole several 12-packs of
Molson Ice beers from the East
University Avenue store.
Allison Chenault, the Dairy
Mart clerk working at the time
of the incident, saw the students
taking the beer but did not make
any effort to stop them. Instead,
she was seen on videotape hug-
ging the three players. Chenault
was subsequently fired from
Dairy Mart and received the
same sentence as the players.

Detroit police feel bankrupl

Low pay and old
facilities wear down
morale despite
positive changes
DETROIT (AP) - It has come
to this: Even some criminals
sympathize with Detroit's cops.
Baron Coleman thought he'd
heard it all in his 17 years patrol-
ling the streets. But then came
the city's bankruptcy, a 10 per-
cent cut in police salaries, fol-
lowed by support from a most
unlikely corner - the bad guys.
"When they saw us take a pay
cut they were in shock. We were
arresting guys ... and they were
like, 'I can't believe your city
would do you like this.' ... I say,
'Thanks for caring,"' the veteran
officer says with a smile. "It's
just funny because I don't like
communicating with a person
who has just committed a rob-

bery how sad my life is."
Detroit police officers have
long known adversity: They've
worked in crumbling station
houses with busted pipes, driv-
en run-down cars, tangled with
balky radios. They've navigat-
ed darkened streets - Detroit
has thousands of broken street
lights - chasing criminals,
breaking up fights, encountering
drug dealers who may be carry-
ing AK-47s or wearing their own
bulletproof vests.
As Detroit tries to rebound
- a plan to emerge from bank-
ruptcy was filed Friday - few
groups, if any, have been feeling
the pain of the city's financial
collapse more than the police.
Despite some recent positive
changes - a new chief, new
cruisers, new plans - there's
worry, frustration and anger
among the rank and file. Pay-
checks have shrunk. Morale is
low. Co-workers have fled to
more lucrative jobs. And those

who remain face a formidablet
task: trying to protect a sprawl-
ing, often violent city where hid-
den dangers lurk among tens of
thousands of abandoned houses.
Baron Coleman knows it's
hard being a police officer any-
where. In these trying times, itI
may be a lot harder in Detroit.

he had certain expectations: a
good salary, great benefits and a
pension.
The bankruptcy erased allI
that. The city's financial future
is uncertain. So is his own.
Though he still enjoys being
an officer, Coleman he says

there? If I get injured, is the
city going to cover my family?
... Before I would tell my wife,
'If I die, I know you'll be taken
care of.' Now, I tell her, 'If I die,
you're on your own."'
The plan by Detroit's emer-
gency financial manager to pull
the city out of bankruptcy would
give police and fire retirees at
least 90 percent of their pen-
sions after eliminating cost-of-
living allowances (other city
workers would likely get at least
70 percent). But that plan prob-
ably faces court challenges and
hinges on proposed state fund-
ing, among other factors.
While so many unresolved
issues linger, the department
is under new leadership. James
Craig knew all about the depart-
ment's troubles, but the former
Detroit police officer who spent
much of his 37-year law enforce-
ment career in Los Angeles
eagerly returned home last sum-
mer to take what he called his
"dream job" - chief of police.
He is the fifth man to hold the
position in five years. But he is
undaunted.

At least 18 have
been killed in recent
protest-related
violence
BANGKOK (AP) - Two
young siblings and a woman
were killed in an apparent gre-
nade attack against anti-gov-
ernment protesters occupying
an upscale shopping area of
Thailand's capital on Sunday,
the latest violence in a months-
long political crisis that is grow-
ing bloodier by the day.
The attack near the Ratchap-
rasong intersection in the heart
of Bangkok, home to major
shopping malls and luxury
hotels, followed another assault
on anti-government protesters
in eastern Thailand on Saturday
night that killed a young girl
and wounded dozens of other
people.
A 6-year-old girl, Patchara-
korn Yos-ubon, died Monday
from brain and liver injuries,
according to Erawan emergen-
cy services center, which keeps
track of protest casualties in
Bangkok. She died one day after
her 4-year-old brother, Korawit,
and a 59-year-old woman were
killed in the attack.
A 9-year-old boy suffering
from brain and lung damage
from the explosion remained
in the intensive care unit of
Ramathibodi Hospital, accord-
ing to a hospital statement
released Monday.
Erawan center said Sunday's
violence left 21 others injured.
The attacks were the latest
in a spate of protest-related vio-
lence roiling Thailand over the
past three months, with at least
18 people killed and hundreds
hurt. The protesters, who are
occupying several key intersec-
tions in Bangkok, want Prime
Minister Yingluck Shinawa-

tra to quit to make way for an
appointed interim government
to implement anti-corruption
reforms, but she has refused.
On Saturday night, a 5-year-
old girl was killed and about
three dozen people wounded
in an attack on an anti-govern-
ment rally in the eastern prov-
ince of Trat.
The perpetrators have not
been identified in either attack.
Both sides in the ongoing politi-
cal dispute have blamed the
other for instigating violence.
A protest leader, Sathit Won-
gnongtoey, said Sunday's explo-
sion was caused by a grenade.
Six protesters were hurt Friday
night by a grenade attack in the
same area.
Explosives experts from
the police and army cordoned
off the immediate area of the
blast to search for clues amid
vendors' overturned tables
and bloodied sandals. Protest-
ers, meanwhile, continued to
rally on streets in the area that
they have occupied for several
weeks, while soldiers patrolled
in combat gear.
While the protesters have
failed repeatedly to force Yin-
gluck out through self-declared
deadlines, they have blocked
the prime minister from work-
ing at her normal offices and
have sent roving mobs after her,
making it difficult for her and
Cabinet members to make pub-
lie appearances.
The protesters also have suc-
ceeded in delaying completion
of early elections called by Yin-
gluck, undermining efforts to
restore political stability.
"I strongly condemn the use
of violence in recent days that
has caused many deaths both in
Trat province and, especially, at
Ratchaprasong today, which is
particularly saddening and dis-
turbing since the lives of chil-
dren were lost," Yingluck said
in a statement Sunday night.

PROFESSORS
From Page 1A
from the School of Kinesiology,
School of Art and Design, LSA
and the College of Engineering
were honored.
The winners include Associate
Prof. MelissaGross,who is appoint-
ed in School of Kinesiology and the
School of Art & Design; Associate
Prof. Anne McNeil, who teaches
chemistry in LSA and macromo-
lecular science and engineering in
the College of Engineering;Associ-
ate Prof. Megan Sweeney, who is
appointed in the LSA departments
of English language and literature,
women's studies and Afroameri-
can and African studies; and Prof.
Michael Thouless of mechanical
engineering and materials science
and engineering. Herrero-olaizola
is appointed in the LSA Depart-
ment of Romance Languages and
Literatures and Phillips is of the
College of Engineering's electrical
engineering and computer science
department.
The professorship is named
after Arthur Thurnau, who was
a University student from 1902 to
1904 and who later endowed the
program.
In interviews with The
Michigan Daily, the professors
emphasized their love for
teaching and excitement to be
named a Thurnau professor.
"I feel like I've learned so
much from my students and
colleagues," Sweeney said. "I
have been inspired by them and it
feels like such a wonderful honor
to be recognized as somebody
who cares a lot about teaching,
who loves doing it and love
learning from my students and
my colleagues."
Herrero-Olaizola also named
students as key components of
the classroom community and
discussion.
"The students really make the
class," he said. "We tend to think
of professors making the class,
but I really think the students are
the ones makingthe class happen.
I see myself more asa facilitator."
Tenured faculty who receive
the title also receive a $20,000
grant to support teaching activi-
ties, such as buying books, travel
and graduate student assistance.
They are also designated as Thr-
nau professors through the dura-
tion of their University career.
Asforhis planswiththemoney,
Phillips said he will provide
support for graduate student
researchers in his lab. Herrero-
Olaizola said he anticipates using
the money for a bigger projector
and screencapturing tools for his
students' film studies.
The Thurnau Charitable
Trust, established by University
alum Arthur Thurnau, funds the
professorship. He attended the
Universityfrom 1902 to 1904.
Deans, associate deans, chairs
or academic program directors
nominated professors, followed
by an endorsement by each nomi-
neee's overseeing dean and letters
of support from students and col-
leagues. These nominations were
submitted in Decmber 2013.
University Provost Martha
Pollack then recommended recip-
ients to the University's Board
of Regents, who approved and
announced the recipients at their
February meeting.

"After every game, we sit

"My tactical skills are my abil-
ity to take everything I learned
during that campaign at a grass-
roots level and bring it to student
government," she said.
Manes and Abraham met on
the Obama campaign, as Manes
was one of the students Abraham
coordinated with. Since then,
they have worked alongside one
another in the CSG Assembly.
During their tenure as repre-
sentatives, Manes and Abraham
organized retreats for CSG rep-
resentatives, which are held each
semester and last three to four
hours each. The events aim help
foster a collaborative atmosphere
within student government.
Transparency is one of forUM's
main platform points, Manes
said. Abraham added that the two
hope to increase communication
between CSG representatives
and their respective schools.
In early February, Manes
said one of her campaign goals
is to add a student representa-
tive to the University's Board of
Regents. The board currently
holds eight representatives who
were all popularly elected by the
voters of the state of Michigan.

Sarmiento and Medical stu-

"You had a group of students
who came to the front of the
line - whether they were first
or not I don't know - but they
were there prior to 7 o'clock,"
Rademacher said. "What I didn't
want to do was take this group of
students and throw them to the
end of the line, then that would
have created more problems. I
looked upon the best solution by
accommodating them in a way
where they still had good seats."
Deyoung said although he
understood the issues the
University Athletic Department
and security faced, he was
disappointed with how the
experience unfolded.
"I just wish that it was
handled differently up front,"
Deyoung said. "I wish they had
the proper security there. I wish
they had proper guidelines set.
I would like to be reimbursed
in some sort of way because I
spent a lot of money and I was
planning on camping out and
getting the full experience and
Manes said.
While voter turnout for CSG
elections is usually low, Abraham
said she hopes to systemize voter
registration efforts to increase
active student voting turnout.
"Right now, there is no cen-
tralized way for students on this
campus to register to vote and
really engage themselves in the
political process," she said.
The candidates said they are
meeting with upwards of five
student organizations per day
to find out what their needs are
and the challenges that they face.
forUM hopes to work with these
organizations as well to spread
the party's message and cam-
paign goals.
"All students feel empowered
through student government and
can use student government as
a platform for empowerment to
elevate the work they are already
doing in their community,"
Manes said.
Manes and Abraham are also
trying to distance the current
forUM leadership from last year's
nominees and marred election.
forUM's previous nominee for
CSG president, now-LSA senior
Chris Osborn, won the popular
vote but was later disqualified
by the University Election Com-
mission for allegedly influencing
students while they were voting.
Manes said forUM's contro-
versial history is irrelevant to
this year's campaign. Instead of
dwelling on the past election,
Manes said student should focus
above freezing."
In addition to the plunge, the
event consisted of a costume
parade with teams and individu-
als wearing costumes ranging
from Superman, hula girls and
Speedo-clad men. Former Mich-
igan football players Denard
Robinson and Jordan Kovacs,
as well as Michigan coach Brady
Hoke served as the judges for
the costume contest.

I don't feel like I'm going to get
that now."
Both Rademacher and Shaffer
told students they would be able
to voice their concerns to Maize
Rage and University Athletic
Department representatives in
the future.
In an e-mail interview with
the Daily Sunday afternoon,
Shaffer said she would address
concerns at the next Maize Rage
meeting, which is scheduled for
Monday at 7 p.m.
Rademacher told the 119
sequestered students that they
would be contacted for par-
ticipation in a forum discussing
Sunday's seating issues.
In an interview with the Daily
Sunday afternoon, Business
senior Michael Proppe, CSG
President, said today's compli-
cations illustrate a systematic
problem with student seating.
"The bottom line is that there
needs to be more student seating
in the lower bowl," Proppe said.
"It is kind of insane that people

could get there at 5 a.m. and not
be able to get a bleacher seat."
LSA freshman Eric Montag,
who was one of the 119 seques-
tered students, expressed a sim-
ilar sentiment.
"I think that a lot of the other
big basketball programs wrap
around the entire lower bowl to
some extent," he said. "The fact
that there's just the bleachers
that hold literally 400 people at
the most is just way too small."
Deyoung said overall, the
experience made him feel like
the University Athletic Depart-
ment values profit over student
experience.
"I know it's a moneymak-
ing business, but it seems like
they're not trying to serve us as
much as they're trying to serve
themselves and that's frustrat-
ing for me," Deyoung said. "I
think they're going to lose a lot
of support in the future as far as
donations and fans, just because
they treat us like patrons rather
than students."

Manes and Abraham bring a

Manes compliment each other

After drying off and warming

Donating to school priorities
The regents need to push donors to fund University priorities

series of renovations that will change the landscape of the institution.

A promise long overdue

The new anti-racist movement
building on this campus has the
power to force the University to
take the long overdue steps needed
to keep promises it made in the 1970
Black Action Movement agreement.
On April 1, 1970, the University
administration and the University's
Board of Regents, under the
pressure of an integrated and
powerful student strike, promised
Black and Latin@ students to take
steps to increase the number of
minority students on campus. BAM,
an umbrella organization comprised
of all the Black student groups, and
the small but growing Latin@ and
Chican@ organizations on campus,
began by recognizing that the
gains won from the Black students'
actions beginning in the mid-1960s,
including the creation of special
minority scholarships, hiring of
Black faculty and new high school
outreach programs for Detroit had
failed to make the University a more
welcoming and less racist campus.
BAM understood that increasing
minority student enrollment was
the prerequisite to changing the
University. The main slogan of
the BAM struggle was "Open
it up or we will shut it down."
In 1970, Black students constituted
a mere 4 percent of the student body.
Latina@ students were treated as
invisible. The University administra-
tion did not even try to keep accurate
statistics on the number of Latin@ or
NativeAmericanstudentsoncampus.
BAM demanded and won the
promise from the University
administration and the regents that
Black student enrollment would
increase to 10 percent of the student
body by the 1973-74 school year. It
won a second demand to increase
Latin@ student enrollment, and
agreed to take special measures
to increase Latin@ enrollment,
including a special recruiter for
Chican@ students as a first step.
The promise to take the actions
necessary to increase Black student

enrollment to 10 percent has been
broken for 40 years. The University
ranked 147th on this year's U.S.
News and World Report diversity
index. The #BBUM campaign
launched this fall documented how
pervasive racism is attheUniversity
now. If the administration and
the regents continue to break the
promises they made to minority
students and communities 40
years ago, the downward cycle of
recruiting and retaining minority
students will continue to get worse.
Ten years after the Supreme
Court victory for affirmative action
in Grutter v. Bollinger and 40 years
after the BAM strike, the proportion
of Black and Latin@ students at the
University is declining. In a state
that is now over 14 percent Black,
Black students comprise less than
5 percent of the student body. The
proportion of Latin@ students
dropped from 5.6 percent in 2006,
to 4.75 percent in 2012, even though
the Latin@ community in Michigan
continues to grow at a rapid rate.
The proportion of Native American
students at the University isless than
half of the proportion of the Native
American population of Michigan.
It is time for a change. It is time
for the movement to force the Uni-
versity administration to keep the
promises they made in 1970. This is
a modest demand given the fact that
the University has had ample time
to keep its promises. The adminis-
tration has always known how to
achieve an increase in underrep-
resented minority student enroll-
ment. If they claim not to know now,
the movement can tell them how.
The creation of scores of com-
mittees, numerous "fireside chats,"
and the pledges made by every
incoming University president to
advance diversity, have done noth-
ing to change the campus climate.
To make the University a campus
that welcomes, nurtures and pro-
vides minority students with the
same opportunities to learn and

develop that it offers to white stu-
dents, the University must carry out
the promises they knew and agreed
were necessary in 1970. Keeping
its pledge to raise Black student
enrollment to 10 percent, revers-
ing the drop in Latin@ enrollment,
creating a Dream Scholarship for
undocumented students and dou-
bling the number of Native Ameri-
can and other under-represented
students are the first steps the Uni-
versity needs to take now to keep
the promises it made to provide the
an equal quality education for every
minority student on this campus.
Meeting the 10 percent demand is
the one measurable and transparent
actionthe University cantaketo prove
to minority youth and communities,
especially to the students of Detroit,
that its commitment to diversity
and integration is more than just
lip service. If the University will
not fulfill the promises they made
40 years ago, there is no reason for
the new student, civil rights and
immigrant rights movement to
believe that the vague and minor
promises it is making behind
closed doors will ever materialize.
Over the next several years the
state of Michigan will provide
the University with new, much
larger public grants. In 1970, the
student movement demanded and
the regents agreed to spend tens
of millions of dollars to increase
minority enrollment. The new
movement has the power to make
the regents use the new infusion of
public fundstheywillstartreceiving
this year to finally fulfill the historic
agreement they entered into in 1970.
Onlybykeepingthe letterandspir-
it of the promises made in 1970, can
the University of Michigan become
the great university it claims to be.

Notorious drug lord
caught by wiretaps

Gorbachev addresses
Ukraine political reform

Police use cell
phone technology to
find "El Chapo"
CULIACAN, Mexico (AP) -
After fruitlessly pursuing one
of the world's top drug lords for
years, authorities finally drew
close to Joaquin "El Chapo"
Guzman using a cellphone found
at a house where drugs were
stored.
The phone belonging to a
Guzman aide was recovered
with clues from a U.S. wiretap
and provided a key break in the
long chase to find Guzman, offi-
cials told The Associated Press
on Sunday.
Another big leap forward
came after police analyzed
information from a different
wiretap that pointed them to
a beachfront condo where the
legendary leader of the Sinaloa
cartel was hiding, according to
a U.S. government official and a
senior federal law enforcement
official.
When he was at last taken into
custody with his beauty-queen
wife, Guzman had a military-
style assault rifle in the room,
but he didn't go for it.
A day after the arrest, it was
not yet clear what would happen
next to Guzman, except that he
would be the focus of a lengthy
and complicated legal process to
decide which country gets to try
him first.
The cellphone was found Feb.
16 at house Guzman had been
using in Culiacan. By early the
next day, the Mexican military
had captured one of Guzman's
top couriers, who promptly pro-
vided details of the stash houses
Guzman and his associates had
been using, the officials said.
At each house, the Mexican
military found the same thing:
steel reinforced doors and an
escape hatch below the bath-
tubs. Each hatch led to a series
of interconnected tunnels in the
city's drainage system.
The officials, whospoke onthe
condition of anonymity because
they were not authorized to pub-
licly discuss how Guzman was

located, said troops who raided
Guzman's main house in Culia-
can chased him through the
drainage pipes before losing him
in the maze under the city.
A day later, on Feb. 18, Guz-
man aide Manuel Lopez Ozorio
was arrested and told investiga-
tors that he had picked up Guz-
man, cartel communications
chief Carlos Manuel Ramirez
and a woman from a drainage
pipe and helped them flee to
Mazatlan.
When he was finally in hand-
cuffs, the man who eluded Mexi-
can authorities for more than a
decade looked pudgy, bowed and
middle-aged in a white button-
down shirt and beltless black
jeans.
Now 56, he had successfully
eluded authorities since escap-
ing from prison in 2001 in a
laundry truck.
He is likely to face a host of
charges in Mexico related to his
role as the head of the cartel,
which is believed to sell cocaine,
marijuana, heroin and metham-
phetamine in some 54 countries.
He also faces extensive allega-
tions in the United States, where
grand juries in at least seven
federal district courts, including
Chicago, San Diego, New York
and Texas, have indicted him.
Federal officials in Chicago
were among the first to say they
wanted to try Guzman, followed
by prosecutors in Brooklyn, N.Y.
In an email Sunday, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Steven Tiscione
in Brooklyn said it would be up
to Washington to make the final
call.
A Justice Department offi-
cial, speaking on condition of
anonymity because it's a matter
of sensitive diplomatic discus-
sions, said no decisions regard-
ing extradition have been made.
During his 13 years on the
run, Guzman was rumored to
live everywhere from Argentina
to Mexico's "Golden Triangle," a
mountainous, marijuana-grow-
ing region straddling the north-
ern states of Sinaloa, Durango
and Chihuahua.
Under his leadership, the
cartel grew deadlier and more
powerful, taking over much of

the lucrative trafficking routes
along the U.S. border. Guzman
watched from western Mexico's
rugged mountains as authorities
captured or killed the leaders
of every rival group challeng-
ing Sinaloa's perch at the top of
global drugtrafficking.
The stocky son of a peasant
farmer even achieved a slot on
the Forbes' billionaires' list and
earned a folkloric status as being
too powerful to catch.
Then, late last year, authori-
ties started closing on his inner
circle.
The son of one of his two top
partners, Ismael "Mayo" Zam-
bada, was arrested at a border
crossing in Nogales, Ariz., in
November as part of a sprawling,
complex investigation involving
as many as 100 wiretaps, accord-
ing to his lawyer.
A month later, one of the
Sinaloa cartel's main lieutenants
was gunned down by Mexican
helicopter gunships in a resort
town a few hours' drive to the
east. Less than two weeks later,
police at Schipol Airport in
Amsterdam arrested one of the
cartel's top assassins, a man who
handled transport and logistics
for Guzman.
The noose got tighter this
month. Federal forces began
sweeping through Culiacan,
capital of the Pacific coast state
of Sinaloa, where they closed
streets, raided houses, seized
automatic weapons, drugs and
money, and arrested a series of
men Mexican officials carefully
described to reporters as top

Former Soviet
premier says heavy-
handed tactics
alienated populace
SHARJAH, United Arab
Emirates (AP) - Former Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev said
Sunday that the political crisis
in Ukraine, which has seen its
president driven fromthe capital
after months of protests, stems
from its government's failure to
act democratically.
He spoke a day after dem-
onstrators took over Kiev and
seized President Viktor Yanu-
kovych's office as parliament
voted to remove him and hold
new elections.
Protesters first took to the
streets of Kiev late last year
after Yanukovych abandoned
an agreement that would have
strengthen his country's ties
with the European Union in
favor of seeking closer coopera-

tion with Moscow.'
"Ultimately this is the result
of the failure of the government
to act democratically" and to.
engage in dialogue and fight cor-
ruption, Gorbachev said during
an address at the International
Government Communication
Forum in the city of Sharjah in
the United Arab Emirates.
He added that the root cause
of the unrest in Ukraine was an
"interruption of perestroika,"
referring to his reform policies,
and "an interruption of the dem-
ocratic process" there.
Gorbachev also criticized the
disparities that have resulted
from globalization, which he
described as a "blind process"
that has led to uneven develop-
ment and created more losers
than winners in the developing
world.
The 82-year-old Gorbachev
was the last leader of the Soviet
Union, and the reforms he put in
place helped lead to the fall of
Communism.
After becoming the Soviet

leader in March 1985,he pursued
the policies of using "glasnost"
or openness, and "perestroika"
or restructuring. While his
intent had been only reform, the
policies brought about demo-
cratic changes that eventually
led to the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991.
Gorbachev won the 1990
Nobel Peace Prize for his role in
ending the Cold War, but he has
little influence in today's Russia.
Recently he has become
increasingly critical of Russian
President Vladimir Putin.
In December 2011, Gorbachev
urged then-Prime Minister
Putin to step down as tens of
thousandsofprotesters demand-
ed free elections and an end to
Putin's rule in the largest show
of public outrage since protests
20 years ago that brought down
the Soviet Union.
Moscow has backed Yanu-
kovych. He is widely despised in
western Ukraine, but has strong
support in the Russian-speaking
east.

Sheinbein, 34, was tried in
Israel in 1999, two years after
he fled to the country and suc-
cessfully sought refuge from
extradition, enraging Maryland
authorities and briefly threaten-
ing U.S. aid to the Jewish state.
An Israeli court sentenced
Sheinbein to 24 years for his
slaying and dismemberment of
19-year-old Alfredo Enrique
Tello Jr. Sheinbein was 17 at the
time of the killing and could
have faced a life sentence in
Maryland. His extradition to
Maryland was blocked after a
yearlong battle between Israel
and the United States over an
Israeli law that prohibited it.
Following that embarrass-
ment, Israel changed its laws to
allow the extradition of Israeli
citizens on condition that they
are returned to Israel to serve
any sentence imposed.
Sheinbein, of Aspen Hill,
Maryland, confessed to stran-
gling Tello with a rope and hit-
ting him several times with a
sharp object. Sheinbein then
dismembered the body with
an electric saw and burned it,
authorities said. Another teen-
ager charged in the killing,
Aaron Needle, committed sui-
cide while in jail in Maryland.
Sheinbein fled to Israel days
after Tello's remains were
found in a garage. He success-
fully sought refuge under a law
that prevented the extradition
of Israeli citizens to foreign
countries. Sheinbein had only
passing contact with Israel, but
his father, Saul, was born in the
country and Sheinbein qualified
for Israeli citizenship.
Israel refused to extradite
Sheinbein, prompting protests
from senior officials, including
then-Attorney General Janet
Reno. Some congressmen who
had otherwise been friendly to
Israel threatened to cut aid in
response.
Nitzana Darshan-Leitner,
who represented Sheinbein in
1997, bemoaned the "terrible
tragedy" that befell the families
of both the wounded guards and
the shooter and challenged the
system for how it has handled
her client.
"When he was sentenced,
he was 17, without a criminal
background, a kid from a nor-
mal background," she said. "It
is hard to understand how after
all these years in prison it was
not able to help him rehabili-
tate."
Maryland Attorney General
Douglas Gansler, who tried to
extradite Sheinbein back to
the U.S. as a state's attorney in
the 1990s, said Sheinbein was
a troubled young man whose
mental health issues continued
into adulthood.
Gansler said the timing of
Sheinbein's prison outburst was
most striking because he was
close to serving two-thirds of
his sentence and becoming eli-
gible for parole.

Rising comediennes
discuss Comedy
Central show
By MADDIE THOMAS
Daily TV/New Media Editor
Abbi Jacobson and Ilana
Glazer, the stars of Comedy
Central's latest breakout hit,
"Broad City," are not afraid to
tackle the important questions
plaguing our generation today:
"Who would you rather have go
down on you: Michael Buble or
Janet Jackson?" asks Glazer's
character, Ilana Wexler, in a
recent episode. On the record,
Jacobson and Glazer both
agree that Jackson is the better
choice (though Jacobson's ideal
situation would be to also have
Michael Buble in the room,
singing).
"Broad City," which is only
five episodes into its first
season, has received critical
acclaim (see: The Michigan
Daily's coverage of the show,
including Erika Harwood's
pilot review and Kayla Upad-
hyaya's column) for its unique
voice and chemistry between
its two leads, Abbi and Ilana,
who are real-life best friends
and alums of the improvisa-
tional comedy group, Upright
Citizens Brigade (UCB), in New
York City.
Jacobson and Glazer's char-
acters - fictionalized versions
of themselves - are dirty, raun-
chy, awkward and lazy. Critics
are quick to peg the comedians
as feminist icons for bringing
these less-than-"ideal" women
to the silver screen, but Jacob-
son and Glazer maintain that,
while they're happy to be send-
ing a positive message, comedy
is their priority.
"When we're shooting, we
son't have that agenda of being
like, 'We gotta make sure that

an awesome word to describe
us and the show, but at the
same time, while it's great to be
described that way, we're not
female comedians. We're not
female writers. The show is a
comedy about people," Jacob-
son said.
It's true, the show is about
people - especially the people
of Generation Y.
"Both of these characters
went to college, used it and
abused it, and now they're try-
ing to make it after this four-
year vacation. Our generation
has a little bit of a prolonged
adolescence, so 'college life'
can extend into your early
twenties," Glazer said.
The two young comedians
showcase the trials and tribu-
lations of being a millennial
twentysomething through the
lens of their bizarre humor.
"(Our comedy) is like a
heightened realism. We like to
keep you grounded with the
characters' relationship, but
then we take things to an exag-
gerated, silly, level," Jacobson
said.
The key to pulling off that
surrealist humor (see: Fred
Armisen in an adult diaper in
the pilot episode) is the touch
of reality that Jacobson, Glazer
and their writing staff inject
into each episode.
"We try to base the seeds
of every episode on something
that's either happened to us
or friends of ours or the writ-
ers that write the show with us
or their friends, so somewhere
within the episode or scenes in
general is the inkling of some-
thing that's happened in real
life," Jacobson said. "Like, for
example, on last night's epi-
sode (episode five, titled "Fat-
test Asses") we were at this
crazy rooftop party that Abbi
and Ilana felt really uncom-
fortable at, and that's based on
a party that Ilana and I went to

Unlike their unmotivat-
ed characters, Jacobson and
Glazer are enjoying some seri-
ous and well-deserved success
during their post-college years.
In the last two years they have
gone from co-creating a little-
known web series (also called
"Broad City") on YouTube to
co-running a TV show on Com-
edy Central and working with
comedy icon (and fellow UCB
alum) Amy Poehler, who pro-
duces the show. This March,
Jacobson and Glazer will be
flexing their improv muscles
on a live "Broad City" tour
across the U.S. (featuring a
show in Pontiac, MI on March
12).
Despite all the recent hype,
Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer
never forget how lucky they are
to be doing what they love; the
real-life 'broads' are nothing
but grateful and earnest.
"I think we both know how
rare of an opportunity this is
and Comedy Central really
lets us go in terms of what we
wanna write about. It's pretty
awesome," Jacobson said.
Glazer agreed, adding, "We
are definitely sincere ver-
sus snarky or sarcastic. And
sometimes we're like ... 'are we
lame?' But it is what it is. We
sincerely want people to like
this. We never put out like, a
'fuck you' joke. We want people
to escape and enjoy when they
watch our show."
"Broad City" is crass, charm-
ing, magnetic and funny. In a
world where Brooklyn-based
sitcoms about twentysome-
things are a dime a dozen, Abbi
Jacobson and Ilana Glazer have
cultivated a show that, while
familiar in premise, is still
the most refreshingly original
comedy on TV today. Don't
believe me? Check out the full
pilot episode on the show's web-
site. Then make sure to tune in
every Wednesday at 10:30 p.m.
on CunmodvCentral.

dients, but the most profound
ones don't
exploit oft- A
recycled
tropes like The Past
cozy lensing M .g
and a weepy Michigan
score. The best Theater
relationship Sony Pictures
movies care-
fully calibrate Classics
into natural-
ism with enough awkwardness
and unease to convince you that
you're screening a documenta-
ry. Up-and-coming filmmaker
Asghar Farhadi, who delivered
the sensational divorce-centric
Iranian film "A Separation" in
2011, finds his rhythm again in
"The Past," this time with more
bite and a timeless performance
by his leading lady.
The movie starts in Paris
when Marie (Berdnice Bejo,
"The Artist") picks up her
estranged husband Ahmad (Ali
Mosaffa, "Leila") from the air-
port - time to finally ink the
divorce papers. Ahmad soon
finds out that Marie lives with
her new married boyfriend
(Tahar Rahim, "Grand Cen-
tral") and his young son. Yet it's
the eldest of Marie's two daugh-
ters, Lucie (Pauline Burlet, "La
Vie en Rose") who best compli-
cates the story.

Lucie doesn't like the boy-
friend, her mother or, really, her
own (lost) identity, complete
with a compellingly insecure
and rebellious carriage. Once
Lucie realizes that her mother
was having an affair with a mar-
ried man, she acts on a sense of
restitution, creating a hellfire
of veiny screaming and water-
fall tears amid the two families.
The movie never tries to rectify
any of the characters' decisions,
because that would imply a
"mistake" was made.
As the title suggests, "The
Past" cleverly fuses the not-
so-bright pasts of the key plot
players, leaving us room to
root for no one in particular,
yet we empathize with every-
body bereft of the victimiza-
tion tropes that many acclaimed
movies in 2013 seemed to proj-
ect. You know the kind: feel
sorry for the depressed weirdo
in "Her," the protagonist in "12
Years a Slave," the oppressed in
"Fruitvale Station" and so on.
The drama is so real that we feel
on a different emotional wave-
length than we're used to when
watching a melodrama that
tells us it's drama. We instead
feel on an even keel with these
characters, as if they were our
just-as-troubled-as-us next door
neighbors.
Bdrdnice Bejo as Marie quar-
terbacks this palpable realism
with vim and affect. After trial-
and-erroring her way through
several relationships, she gradu-

ally loses any grip on her increas-
ingly disobedient daughter and
her complex marital mess. A
climactic scene captures her
violently shaking Lucie, scream-
ing, "Why would you do this to
me?!" She angrily informs us
that she's finished with Ahmad
and wants to tread forward
with her new boyfriend, but too
many things hold her back in the
subtlest of ways: Lucie's resis-
tance; Ahmad's comfort with
the children and the boyfriend's
contagious pessimism. Her vacil-
lating feelings lead the story into
a darker but more honest place.
Timeless
authenticity.
The minimalist camerawork
complements the film that needs
no score. That doesn't mean the
film is unsuitable for a full-on
orchestral soundtrack, but our
helmer elected to let his charac-
ters and their raw crossings cre-
ate music, both authentic and
without superfluous notes.
We like the Bejo-Farhadi
actor/filmmaker tag-team. They
play off each other's sriousness
with humility and authenticity.
Totally snubbed it the Oscars
this year, "The Past" is a brute
cinematic force, one that isn't
afraid to show how ugly a
separation can get.

loud on the sideline. Beilein,
at least as far as basketball
coaches are concerned, is more
subdued.
Izzo speaks his mind. It's
refreshing. Ask him a question;
he'll answer it. Beilein is more
calculated. Ask him a question,
and sometimes he'll answer
it, and sometimes that answer
won't mean anything.
So, when hit by a truly
terrible string of injuries this
year - notably to Adreian
Payne, Keith Appling and
Branden Dawson - Izzo
reacted thusly: He told Sports
Illustrated he didn't want to
make excuses, but there had
just been so many darn injuries.
After Michigan beat Michigan
State in January, he said, "I
played guys that hadn't played in

a month." Two days later, during
an eventual overtime win over
Iowa, he told a sideline reporter,
"I've got some weird guys in
there right now."
Beilein has lost guys too.
But Mitch McGary has become
something of an afterthought.
The cavalry isn't coming.
It's two different approaches
to coaching, or a small part of it,
anyway.
That approach has behooved
Beilein. He has gone on that
6-2 run against Michigan
State using, mostly, very young
teams.
Trey Burke replaced Darius
Morris who replaced Manny
Harris.
For Izzo, the past is cause
for complaint, and the groans
aren't unjustified.

For Beilein, the past doesn't

greatness, with mercy-rule
victories and strong pitching
performances highlighting
the first two weekends of
the season. But what the
Wolverines hadn't yet done
was put together a weekend of
complete dominance.
That changed this weekend.
The sixth-ranked Wolverines
went 5-0 in three days at the
FAU Kickoff tournament
in Boca Raton, Fla., picking
up wins over Kent State,
Pittsburgh, Florida Atlantic and
No. 5 Kentucky and showing off
their versatility in the process.
Friday, Michigan's bats were
overpowering. Sophomore
shortstop Sierra Romero got the
action started with a one-out
RBI single in
the first inning
against Kent t ,
State, and her W e've g

posted seven
runs against
the Golden
Flashes (6-4) and nine more
against Pittsburgh inthe second
half of the double header.
Sophomore left fielder Sierra
Lawrence went 3-for-4 against
Kent State with three RBI, and
Romero went 1-for-l after being
pitched around for most of the
game, drawing two walks and
adding a sacrifice fly.
Later in the day, against the
Panthers (7-7), senior right
fielder Nicole Sappingfield took
her turn as sparkplug.
Up by two with two outs in
the second inning, Sappingfield
stepped to the plate with
runners at second and third and
knocked one over the right-field

fence. The home run ignited a
seven-run inning, all her team
needed to cruise to a 9-0victory.
"We definitely got in a
rhythm," Sappingfield said.
"We kind of realized what we
can do and what potential we
have. We just really relaxed and
played our game."
The hitting clinic put on
by Michigan (12-2) on Friday
overshadowed dominant
pitching performances by
freshman right-handed pitcher
Megan Betsa and junior lefty
Haylie Wagner, but the pitchers
quickly became the team's focal
point Saturday.
That morning, Michigan
sent Wagner back into the
circle in its matchup with No. 5
Kentucky.
The southpaw was nearly
flawless in the outing, giving
up just two hits and striking
out five with no walks in a 3-0
victory.
"(Wagner)

not trying too
hard. She's
pitching with
confidence
and got better from Friday to
Saturday."
But the Wolverines' pitching
prowess didn't stop with
just Wagner. Junior right-
handed pitcher Sara Driesenga
bounced back from a pair of
uncharacteristic outings the
week before - she gave up six
runs to Louisiana Lafayette
and five to Boston College - to
throw the first seven innings
of an extra-innings rematch
against the Golden Flashes
Saturday afternoon.
After trading zeros on the
scoreboard all afternoon,
Michigan finally broke through
in the bottom of the ninth.

With Sierra Romero placed
on second to start the inning
- an extra-innings rule in
college softball - Lawrence
walked before junior catcher
Lauren Sweet grounded out
to advance the runners with
Sappingfield coming up. The
senior delivered once again,
lacing a walk-off single down
the right-field line.
Driesenga held Kent State
to four hits and no walks
before yielding to Wagner, who
ultimately came away with the
win after pitching the game's
final two innings. Between
the two games, Driesenga and
Wagner combined to pitch 16
scoreless innings, giving up just
six hits while striking out 12.
"We feed off of each others'
games," Wagner said. "We just
trust each other and believe we
can get the job done. We've got
three great pitchers, and that
really pushes us forward."
Against Florida Atlantic
(7-7) on Sunday, the narrative
was much the same. Betsa got
the nod in the circle and didn't
disappoint, striking out 11 in a
complete-game shutout - the
Wolverines'- fourth in a row.
Any other result would've likely
meant a loss, as the Michigan
offense mustered just three
hits and scored its lone run on a
bases-loaded walk by Sweet.
"The pitchers really did
their part," Hutchins said.
"They didn't get caught up
in the circumstances they
didn't control, which was our
offensive production.
"They can only keep us in
the game with our defense and
their pitching. And I thought all
three did a nice job with that."
Most games, the Wolverines
won't need their pitchers to post
straight zeroes. Still, the type
of poise Michigan displayed
in the circle this weekend is a
coveted commodity - one that
separates teams that are just
talented from those that are
truly dominant.

Turnovers plague Wolverines

Defensive miscues
lead to Friday loss
By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
Defensive inconsistencies
have plagued the Michigan
hockey team all season, and
those same theatrics played out
inasecondconsecutive weekend
filled with disappointment.
With a 3-1 lead late in the
second period of Friday's
game against Penn State, the
Wolverines looked poised to
snap a three-game losing streak.
But a Nittany Lions goal with
35 seconds left made things
interesting heading into the
second intermission.
Then, Michigan self-
destructed.
It was as if the Wolverines
pointed a 12-gauge shotgun at
their bare feet and pulled the
trigger, collapsing against an
opponent that has won two
conference games all season -
both against Michigan.
"When you have the lead
at home, you should build on
it," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "In the third period
the game is on the line, and we
gave it away. They earned it, but
we gave it away."
There had been plenty of
defensive miscues in previous
games, but this was far from
an isolated mistake. Veteran
players made elementary
blunders, and a string of three
costly turnovers resulted in
three Penn State goals.
It was junior forward
Alex Guptill's miscue at the
offensive blue line early in
the third period that resulted
in forward Dylan Richard's
shorthanded breakaway goal to
tie the game. Though Guptill
later scored what should have
been Michigan's go-ahead
goal, his lackluster effort in
the defensive zone all evening
caused Berenson to bench him

for Saturday's game.
"We need him to work hard
every shift, the whole game,"
Berenson said. "You've got
to play both ends of the rink.
You're never going to be a good
hockey player if you can't play
hard at both ends of the rink."
Senior defenseman Mac
Bennett has been the catalyst
of a young defensive corps,
but his gaffes late in the third
period and in overtime Friday
ultimately pushed his team
toward defeat. With 10 ticks
on the clock, Yost Ice Arena
was buzzing in anticipation of
a victory. Then, Bennett swung
a blind pass behind his own net
and into the corner where two
Nittany Lions waited patiently.
And 5.4 seconds later, the
puck Bennett just had safely in
his grasp was sitting in the net.
Yost fell silent, and fans shifted in
their seats waiting for overtime.
With under a minute
remaining in the extra period,
Bennett mishandled the puck
in the offensive zone, springing

Penn State to an odd-man
rush. Forward David Goodwin
roofed a shot past freshman
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort
with 43 seconds left, and
Bennett probably wished he
were anywhere but under the
microscope of thousands of
Michigan fans.
"This doesn't come down to
talent, and this is really hard
work and just sticking with it,"
Berenson said. "The defense
and hopefully the goalie will
make up for your mistakes. And
tonight, it didn't happen."
It'd be easy to make excuses
about defensive lapses, especially
since two starting defensemen -
freshman Michael Downing and
junior Andrew Sinelli - were
both suspended from Friday's
game for illegal hits Feb. 15 at
Minnesota.
But as expected, the
Wolverines refused to make any
excuses. Instead, sophomore
forward Andrew Copp talked
about how the loss stains
the reputation of a place like

Michigan.
"I think everyone knows we
need to pick it up, because this is
flat out unacceptable," Copp said.
Copp realized the magnitude
of another embarrassing defeat,
and the next evening, the
Wolverines had to respond.
They needed a victory, and they
got one, dominating Penn State
as they should have the night
before, 5-2. It wasn't anything
to be too overjoyed about, but
Berenson and his players were
somewhat content, and perhaps
even relieved.
But Friday was the deal-
breaker. With a chance to
bounce back from a lackluster
weekend at Minnesota on Feb.
14-15, Michigan stumbled and
fell flat on its face. One win in
a two-game series against the
lowly Nittany Lions was far
from ideal.
And for a team that's
now hovering around a .500
conference record with a slew
of defensive concerns, Michigan
might just be fortunate to stay

Four games to go, but the hard work is done

It was a matchup between
the two best teams in the
Big Ten, the ones perched
atop the standings. Michigan
and Michigan State were ahead
of the rest of the pack, and this
was the teams' last scheduled
matchup of the year.
If t didn't
know better,
I might say
that this
game would
determine
the Big Ten
champion.
The NEAL
Wolverines ROTHSCHILD
wouldn't
have any
tough games after this one, and
the Spartans would continue to
get their injured players back
and in rhythm. Luckily for
Michigan, itngot the grand prize
- a season sweep and a Big Ten
title.
But not quite in the eyes of
the team.
"We know we've got four
big games left, so it's definitely
going to be tough," said
sophomore guard Nik Stauskas,
Even against Purdue,
Minnesota, Illinois and
Indiana?
"To be honest, we try to
treat every game that way,
every game like a Big Ten
Championship," said fifth-year
senior forward Jordan Morgan.
But wasn't this game
even more for a Big Ten
Championship?
"We have four games to
play," said Michigan coach John
Beilein. "What it does do right
now is put us in position to be in
position. That's all it does."
Fine.
There arefour games left, but
this was a signature win for a
program that hasn't stopped
stockpiling signature wins

over the last four years. It was
a game against Michigan's
toughest rival in the most
important game of the season.
Yes, there are four games
left, but because of this one,
Michigan only needs to win
three of the last four to win
a share of the title, and if
Michigan State loses again, for
an outright title.
All of the circled games on
Michigan's schedule have come
and gone. The tough part is
over. The remaining games on
the calendar are against teams
in the bottom half of the Big
Ten with the road contests
coming against the conference's
No. 9 and No. 11 squads. On
Sunday, the Wolverines landed
the big fish.

season, scoring 25 points on

"Maybe (it was) a little bit

basketball player. I like taking
pride in being one of the best
players on the floor every time I
step out there.
"When teams shut me
out, it's frustrating, and I
didn't want to let that happen
anymore."
Four games left, but this
one meant dominance over
Michigan State. Having won
six of its last eight against
the Spartans, Michigan has
asserted itself as the top
basketball presence in the state,
at least for the time being.
Six of eight isn't just a few

good years - it's sustained
success. It's Keith Appling and
Adreian Payne having come and
gone without ever winning in
Ann Arbor. With four wins in
the next two weeks, it means
two Michigan Big Ten titles
to Michigan State's one for its
senior class.
Over a four-year period when
Michigan sports have been
pockmarked by mediocrity on
the football field, where the
Spartans have laid Michigan
to waste, the basketball team
swung back. Michigan State
may have stolen the gridiron,
but Michigan has taken the
hardwood.
"It says that we're back,"
Beilein said. "Michigan's back
in so many ways.... If you
compete with Michigan State,
then you're competing with all
the other top schools. We hadn't
been there for a while. It's just
good to be in that position....
Consistency is the things that
Wisconsin and Michigan State
and Ohio State have been able
to do.
"Their kids don't know
what it's like to (not) go to the
NCAA Tournament. That's the
mentality that we want."
Of course, Michigan has
to perform in thefour games
left, but the title was earned
on Sunday. The Wolverines'
performance was the material
that Big Ten championships are
made of.
Over the span of seven
minutes in the second half,
Michigan flipped a 48-43
deficit into a 64-52 lead. It
was a run Michigan State
couldn't withstand and one that
has Michigan sitting pretty

championship since 1985-86.

to sweep
against Nebraska and in both of
their games against Wisconsin.
In Michigan's upset of the
then-third-ranked Badgers in
Madison, the three sophomores
combined for 57 points. On
the season, when they're all
in double figures, Michigan is
6-2, with the two losses coming
against then-No. 1 Arizona, and
at home against Wisconsin.
Sunday was a glimpse at what
could be when Stauskas, LeVert
and Robinson all perform at
the top of their games. It's a
team that can play the top-
ranked Wildcats until the final
possession, hand the Badgers
their first loss at home this
season and down a state rival in
the most anticipated home game
of the season.
"We're a team that likes when
other people succeed," LeVert
said. "We really love each other
out there.
"So when we see one guy's got
it going, we just try to get him
the ball as much as possible."
Unselfish and sharing the
load is how the sophomore trio
has set the Wolverines up for
a chance to control their own

destiny and take home the
conference title.
