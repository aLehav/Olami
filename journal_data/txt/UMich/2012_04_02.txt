STUDENT GOVERNMENT
SAM rallies
for higher
ed. funding

STATE BUDGET
'U' stem cell
programs
under attack

Amid rain, wind
100 turnout for
protest at Capitol
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
LANSING - Despite heavy
rain and strong winds, almost
100 students from across the
state came to Lansing on Fri-
day to protest funding cuts to
higher education and to advo-
cate for students' rights.
The rally - held by the Stu-
dent Association of Michigan,
a collaborative organization
of student governments at
universities in the state -
was close to being cancelled
due to a -heavy thunderstorm
that persisted throughout
the morning and afternoon.
However, the storm ceased
just minutes before the stu-
dents began their march from
the Lansing Center to the
steps of the capitol building.
SAM President Jay Gage, a
student at Lake Superior State

University, met with state
senators and representatives
on Thursday, before speaking
at the rally on Friday.
"We desperately need rein-
vestment in higher educa-
tion," Gage said. "If we are
going to have a good educa-
tional sector, then we fund it."
Gage lauded higher edu-
cation in the state and called
Michigan's institutes of
higher learning "the most
prestigious universities in the
world," particularly praising
the University of Michigan.
During the 90-minute
rally, the students, waving
colorful flags with university
logos, listened to speeches
from several speakers while
occasionally interrupting
with loud chants and vuvuz-
elas.
Tyler Helsel, public rela-
tions director for SAM and
a LSSU student, said he was
hoping upwards of 500 stu-
dents would participate in
the rally, but said the weather
discouraged students from

House committee
demands more
information on
studies
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
In light of ongoing disputes
over the University's embryonic
stem cell research efforts, the state
House Appropriations Subcommit-
tee on Higher Education passed
a budget recommendation Friday
seeking to strip the University of
some of its funding from the state.
The recommendation comes
more than two weeks after Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman's
critical remarks to the committee
about its budget formulation, and
stems from a disagreement over
the type of information the Univer-
sity should report to the legislators.
Republican members of the com-
mittee insist that the University
must provide specific data on the
research, while University officials

have resisted those efforts.
This year, instead of supply-
ing the data points the committee
requested, the University compiled
what Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-
versity's vice president for govern-
ment relations, called a packet of
press releases and scientificejournal
articles on the University's embry-
onic stem cell research.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the University sent
the package to legislators to pro-
vide them with a more in depth
look at the research going on at the
University.
"It gave the legislature a deeper,
broader, richer understanding of
the stem cell research than a simple
list of five or six numbers," Fitzger-
ald said.
Wilbanks added that one reason
the University did not provide the
data was that it does not generate
documents that contain the data
the committee requested.
"We have provided a lot of infor-
mation that may in part include
some of the data points that were
identified in the higher education

ANN ARBOR PUBLIC TRANSIT
AirRide bus service begins

From the Editor:

Route will serve
Detroit Metro
starting today
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
With summer quickly
approaching, students may
now have an easier time find-
ing their way home at the end
of the semester with the assis-
tance of AirRide - a newly
launched service that provides
daily roundtrip bus transpor-
tation from the Ann Arbor area
to the Detroit Metropolitan
Wayne County Airport.
The program - a collabo-
ration with Michigan Flyer,
a branch of the Indian Trails
Motor Coach transportation
service - will stop 12 times
daily at the Blake Transit Cen-
ter and the Kensington Court

Hotel, located off of State
Street, as well as four times at
the University's Central Cam-
pus Transit Center. Tickets
range from $6 to $20 a person,
depending on age and how
far in advance a ticket is pur-
chased.
At the official announce-
ment of the service at the
Kensington Court Hotel on
Friday, David Nacht, a Law
School alum and AATA board
member who spearheaded Air-
Ride's development, lauded the
service's affordability and con-
sistency of service to the crowd
of about 40 people.
"This is a big deal," he said.
"You're not going to wait two
or three hours. You need regu-
lar services, and you need to
know that and rely on that.
We're offering that."
Nacht said demand from
University officials was an
important factor in the ser-

vice's introduction, noting that
he surveyed the deans of the
University's schools and col-
leges to find out the biggest
barrier to attracting prospec-
tive faculty and graduate stu-
dents.
"Number one or two on
every dean's list were trans-
portation issues," he said. "The
University is the number one
driver of traffic to and from
our community from this air-
port, and so, this is very much
designed with the University
in mind."
Under current plans for the
service, AirRide may offer air-
port-bound riders parking for
up to 14 days at the Fourth Ave-
nue and East William Street
parking structure and at the
Kensington Court Hotel for $2
per day. It would also poten-
tially share bus stops with the
Detroit SMART bus system.

An article in the March 8
edition of The B-Side, The
Michigan Daily's weekly arts
supplement, ("Ten Thousand
Villages unites art, culture
and philanthropy in one store-
front") contained material that
was plagiarized. The article,
which was about a fair-trade
store on Main Street, contained
several passages that were cop-
ied directly from the Wikipedia
entry on fair-trade products and
from the store's website.
The plagiarism was discov-
ered after an arts editor editing
another one of the reporter's
articles found passages that
were also taken verbatim from
other websites. A thorough
search of the reporter'sprevious
work revealed no other instanc-
es of plagiarism.
The writer in question has
been dismissed, and The Mich-
igan Daily no longer stands
behind the plagiarized article.

This is an unacceptable
violation of this newspaper's
core principles, and correc-
tive actions will be taken. Since
January, when it was discov-
ered that a former Daily col-
umnist's work didn't meet our
paper's ethical standards, we've
stepped up our safeguards
against plagiarism.
We will continue to work to
enhance those safeguards.
This semester, we've expand-
ed the role of our copy desk. Our
copy editors now read all news
and opinion articles and any
arts articles in the B-Side. All
staffers must also now submit
details about any research they
conducted for their piece when
they turn in their articles.
Until now, these steps had
proven successful, as we've
caught a handful of question-
able pieces before they've gone
to print. The Ten Thousand Vil-
lages story slipped through the

cracks. There are no excuses:
This was an egregious error and
we, as Daily editors, take full
blame.
Moving forward, we willnow
require plagiarism checks on all
articles before they go to print.
The arts section already does
this in its day-to-day editing
process, and we will require all
other sections to followsuit.
Plagiarism willnever be com-
pletely preventable, but we can
- and will - do better to ensure
that you can trust the content
you see every day in print and
online as original work.

CAMPUS PHILANTHROPY
1,500 volunteer for annual Detroit Partnership service day

Students
participate in
activities to
rejuvante Detroit
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
DETROIT - For many Univer-
sity students, smashing concrete
or digging trenches may not be
the ideal way to spend a week-

end, but volunteers of the Detroit
Partnership gladly spent Satur-
day participating in such philan-
thropic efforts.
This weekend, about1,500 stu-
dents from the University trav-
eled to Detroit to participate in
events around the city organized
by DP, a student organization
that provides volunteer and edu-
cational opportunities in Detroit
to University students. Working
with community-based groups,
students engaged in activities
ranging from demolishing hous-

es to planting community gar-
dens in an effort to support some
of Detroit's most underprivileged
neighborhoods.
LSA senior Cassie Basler,
executive director of the Detroit
Partnership, explained that the
group arranged events with 35
organizations around the city.
Basler said one of the partner-
ship's strengths is the diverse
and unique opportunities it pro-
vides to its volunteers.
"Not many people have the
opportunity to knock down a

garage with a sledgehammer,"
Basler said.
According to Basler, students
went to several sites around the
city to paint and clean schools,
work in community gardens,
clean abandoned properties,
demolish dilapidated structures
and perform a host of other activ-
ities. In almost every case, com-
munity volunteers, joined the
students, eager to see their own
neighborhoods benefit from the
program.
In Brightmoor, a distressed

Detroit subdivision, volunteers
worked with the neighbor-
hood group Neighbors Building
Brightmoor to prepare commu-
nity gardens for planting, cleared
debris and cleaned up abandoned
properties awaiting demolition.
Riet Schumack, program coor-
dinator for Neighbors Building
Brightmoor, said to prevent aban-
doned homes from being used
as drug houses, residents often
employ a crude technique called
"dropping the porch." The pro-
cess - an economical solution for

a neighborhood where a house
can be purchased for $500, as
compared to the $10,000 it costs
to demolish it - involved tearing
the roof off a home's porch and
letting it fall in front of the door
to prevententry.
"(For) people that come back
to the neighborhood, it's very
mixed feelings," Schumack said.
"They're hurt by the fact that
so many houses are gone, but
they're also happy to see that
something is happening."

Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney addresses an audience during a campaign
stop on the campus of Lawrence University, in Appleton, Wis on Friday.
Democrats sharpen attacks as
GOP rallies around Romney

Obama launches
assault on foreign
policy credentials
MILWAUKEE (AP) -
President Barack Obama's
administration launched a
multi-pronged assault on Mitt
Romney's values and foreign
policy credentials yesterday,
while a fresh set of prominent
Republicans rallied behind the
GOP front-runner as the odds-
on nominee, further signs the
general election is overtaking
the primary season.
A defiant Rick Santorum out-
lined plans to leave Wisconsin
the day before the state's con-
test Tuesday, an indication that
the conservative favorite may
be in retreat, his chances to stop
Romney rapidly dwindling.
"I think the chances are over-
whelmingthat (Romney) will be
our nominee," Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell said
Sunday on CNN's "State of the
Union." "It seems to me we're
in the final phases of wrapping
up this nomination. And most
of the members of the Sen-
.

ate Republican conference are
either supporting him, or they
have the view that I do, that it's
time to turn our attention to the
fall campaign and begin to make
the case against the president of
the United States."
Both Secretary of State Hill-
ary Clinton and Vice President
Joe Biden went after Rom-
ney Sunday, underscoring the
belief inside Obama's Chicago
re-election headquarters that
Romney will - sooner than later
- secure the right to face Obama
this fall. Romney largely agreed,
telling a Madison, Wis., crowd
last night that the nominee "will
probably be me."
The Obama officials' involve-
ment comes as both sides
sharpen their general election
strategy, perhaps weeks before
the GOP contest formally comes
to an end.
"I think Gov. Romney's a
little out of touch," Biden told
CBS' "Face the Nation" in an
interview broadcast Sunday. "I
can't remember a presidential
candidate in the recent past
who seems not to understand,
by what he says, what ordinary
middle-class people are think-

ing about and are concerned
about."
The line of attack is likely to
play prominently in the Obama
campaign's general election
narrative. While Obama is a
millionaire, Romney would be
among the nation's wealthiest
presidents ever elected. And
he's opened himself to criticism
through a series of missteps.
Romney casually bet a rival
$10,000 during a presidential
debate, noted that his wife drives
a "couple of Cadillacs," and lists
owners of professional sports
teams amonghis friends. His per-
sonal tax records show invest-
ments in the Cayman Islands and
a Swiss bank account.
Obama's team yesterday also
seized on Romney's foreign pol-
icy inexperience.
Biden said Obama was "stat-
ing the obvious" when he told
Russian President Dmitry Med-
vedev that he would have more
latitude on missile defense after
the November general election.
The two presidents did not real- 0
ize the exchange, during a meet-
ing in Seoul, South Korea, last
weekend, was being picked up
by a microphone.

LONDON
U.K. to potentially

monitor citizens'
e-mail messages
Every e-mail to your child.
Every status update for your
friends. Every message to your
mistress.
The U.K. government is pre-
paring proposals for a nationwide
electronic surveillance network
that could potentially keep track
of every message sent by any Brit
to anyone at any time, an indus-
try official briefed on the govern-
ment's moves said yesterday.
Plans for a massive government
database of the country's phone
and e-mail traffic were abandoned
in 2008 following a public outcry.
But James Blessing of the Inter-
net Service Providers' Association
said the government appears to be
"reintroducing it on a slightly dif-
ferent format."
Britain's Home Office declined
comment, saying an announce-
ment would have to be made to
Parliament first - possibly as
soon as next month.
There was no indication of
exactly how such a system would
work or to what degree of judi-
cial oversight would be involved,
if any.

Suu Kyi perserveres in
Myanmar historic vote

Activist and former
prisoner elected to
parliament
YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -
She struggled for afree Myanmar
for a quarter-century, much of it
spent locked away under house
arrest. Now, the Nobel Peace
Prize laureate whose nonviolent
campaign for democracy at home
transformed her into a global
icon is on the verge of ascending
to public office for the first time.
Aung San Suu Kyi, 66, was
elected to parliament yesterday
in a historic victory buffeted by
the jubilant cheers of support-
ers who hope her triumph will
mark a major turning point in
a nation still emerging from a
ruthless era of military rule.
If confirmed, the election
win will also mark an aston-

ishing reversal of fortune for a
woman who became one of the
world's most prominent pris-
oners of conscience. When she
was finally released in late 2010,
just after a vote her party boy-
cotted that was deemed neither
free nor fair, few could have
imagined she would make the
leap from democracy advocate
to elected official in less than
17 months, opening the way for
a potential presidential run in
2015.
But Myanmar has changed
dramatically over that time. The
junta finally ceded power last
year, and although many of its
leaders merely swapped their
military uniforms for civilian
suits, they went on to stun even
their staunchest critics by releas-
ing political prisoners, signing
cease-fires with rebels, relaxing
press censorship and opening
a direct dialogue with Suu Kyi

- who they tried to silence for
decades.
As results came in yesterday
night from the poll watchers
of Suu Kyi's party, spokesman
and campaign manager Nyan
Win projected the opposition
would secure most of the vote,
winning 40 of 45 parliamentary
seats at stake. Those included
four in the capital, Naypyitaw,
considered a stronghold of the
ruling party whose leaders
helped build it. The opposition
had contested 44 seats.
Yesterday's by-election was
called to fill vacant seats in
Myanmar's 664-member bicam-
eral assembly, and the military-
backed government had little to
lose by holding it. The last vote
had already been engineered
in their favor - the army was
allotted 25 percent of the seats,
and the ruling party won most
of the rest.

AIRRIDE
From Page 1A
While the buses will stop
more frequently at the two off-
campus stops than they will at
the Central Campus Transporta-
tion Center, AATA officials said
they expect University students
to take advantage of the service.
AATA board chairman Jesse
Bernstein said the service could
be a "perfect opportunity" for
students' parents to shuttle
between Ann Arbor and the air-
port, adding that AirRide came
to fruition partly from the Uni-
versity's encouragement of the
plan to service their faculty and
staff.
"They're very supportive,
because they want to get their
people to the airport back and
forth cheaply and efficiently,"
Bernstein said. "They've been
very cooperative."
A variety of political fig-
ures were also present at the
announcement, including U.S.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.),
state Reps. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) and Rick Olson (R-York
Township) and Ann Arbor
Mayor John Hieftje.
Dingell said the cooperation
between the parties involved in
AirRide is a contrast from the
polarized climate in Washing-
ton, D.C.
"This is just one example
of how this community works
together," Dingell said. "I wish,
perhaps, as I come back from
Washington, I could come and

say that Congress is doing as
well."
Olson added that AirRide is
an important addition to the
city, noting that it serves as ful-
filling a"missinglink."
"(In) every other city in this
county, when you want to get to
downtown or wherever, there
are alternate ways of getting
there," Olson said. "Ann Arbor
doesn't have that other than a
cab, and that's a costly way, and
it's also not an energy efficient
way. Ann Arbor and Detroit -
it's an anomaly when it comes
to major cities in the United
States."
Kirk Steudle, director of the
state's department of trans-
portation and an attendee of
Friday's announcement, also
praised the service for its fulfill-
ment of Republican Gov. Sny-
der's transportation message
this fall.
In an interview in September,
AATA spokeswoman Mary Sta-
siak said the proposed service
was not intended to compete
with AirBus, an airport shuttle
sponsored by the Central Stu-
dent Government that runs
during breaks for University
students.
"(AirBus) service plays a very,
very important role when there
are a tremendous amountof pas-
sengers traveling between the
airport and Ann Arbor at really
high-peak periods, and we don't
see ourselves replacing that at
all," Stasiak said. "In fact, we
would encourage people to use
that service."

attending.
Earlier in the week, Helsel
said 150 people from LSSU were
planning to attend the confer-
ence, but changed their minds
upon hearing the weather report.
Regardless, Helsel said he was
pleased with the students who
did come.
"I still think that it was a good
event," Helsel said. "I think that
the people that were here were
really enthused."
The weather also deterred
University students from mak-
ing the trip to Lansing, and only
a handful of students attended.
LSA junior Sean Walser, chair
of the Central Student Govern-
ment's External Relations Com-
mission, helped plan this year's
rally and said CSG had planned
on taking a bus until student
support waned as a result of the
weather forecast.
"A lot of people were look-
ing at the weather this week
and realizing that was going to
be cold and rainy," Walser said.

"We didn't want to spend the
money on it if it wasn't going to
be used."
LSA junior Aditya Sathi, vice
speaker of CSG, was among Uni-
versity students in attendance at
the rally, and discussed medical
amnesty and the important of
student advocacy.
In particular, Sathi addressed
House Bill 4393, which would
amend a previous law to effec-
tively implement medical
amnesty on a state-wide level.
The bill easily passed the Michi-
gan House of Representatives,
but has yet to be voted on by the
senate.
"We have the opportunity to
save lives here, and why, why is
it that the state senate has not
voted on thisbill yet?" Sathi said.
"Why is it that it hasn't gone on
to the governor's desk?"
Another speaker at the event
was David Knezek, president
of the University of Michigan-
Dearborn Student Govern-
ment. Knezek is graduating this
semester and running for state
representative as a Democrat.
"For me, higher education
personally is the biggest issue

and I think it ties in very inti-
mately to the economy and
Michigan's well-being," Knezek
said.
Eli Karttunen, treasurer of
the Undergraduate Student
Government at Michigan Tech-
nological University, said he
drove 10 hours from Michigan
Tech in Houghton, Michigan to
Lansing to stand out in the blus-
tery weather.
"It's so important to be here
and to actually show state leg-
islators that students matter,"
Karttunen said. "It is 30 to 40
degrees out here, it's raining, it's
cold - it's awesome though."
While attendance may have
been lower than expected for
the SAM rally, Gage said the
organization has been grow-
ing, noting that the University's
recent affiliation with SAM has
been mutually beneficial.
"That not only helps us as an
association get stronger, but it
helps U of M elevate their stu-
dent voices to the state-wide
level," Gage said. "It's definitely
a great partnership that I hope
only gets stronger."

Car bombs in
Thailand kill 14


Muslim insurgents
suspected as cause
attacks
HAT YAI, Thailand (AP)
- Suspected Muslim insur-
gents staged the most deadly
coordinated attacks in years in
Thailand's restive south,.kill-
ing 14 people and injuring 340
with car bombs that targeted
Saturday shoppers and a high-
rise hotel frequented by foreign
tourists.
A first batch of explosives
planted inside a parked pickup
truck ripped through an area of
restaurants and shops in a busy
area of Yala city, a main com-
mercial hub of Thailand's res-
tive southern provinces, said
district police chief Col. Krit-
sada Kaewchandee.
About 20 minutes later, just
as onlookers gathered at the
blast site, a second car bomb
exploded, causing the major-
ity of casualties. Eleven people

were killed and 110 wounded by
the blasts.
More than 5,000 people
have been killed in Thailand's
three southernmost provinces
- Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala
- since an Islamist insurgency
flared in January 2004.
"This is the worst attack
in the past few years," said
Col. Pramote Promin, deputy
spokesman of a regional secu-
rity agency. "The suspected
insurgents were targeting peo-
ple's lives. They (chose) a bus-
tling commercial area, so they
wanted to harm people."
A blast also occurred Satur-
day at a high-rise hotel in the
city of Hat Yai, in the nearby
province of Songkhla. Officials
had initially attributed that
blast to a gas leak, saying it was
unrelated to the attacks blamed
on insurgents. But after inspect-
ing the hotel's underground
parking lot, authorities found a
severely damaged sedan and a
hole created by the explosion's
impact.

STEM CELL -

budget, but we don't have docu-
ments that specifically provide
those kinds of data because the
research, as you know, is done in
a variety of settings all across the
campus," Wilbanks said. "The
data isn't collected that in that
form."
Wilbanks also said that the
committee's request was uncon-
stitutional, noting that state law
promotes research of stem cells
in the state.
"(In order) to ensure that
physicians can conduct the
most promising forms of medi-
cal research in this state, Article
1, Section 27 of the state Consti-
tution - a provision passed by
popular vote in 2008 - states,
'any research permitted under
federal law on human embryos
may be conducted in Michi-
gan,"' Wilbanks said.
Wilbanks added that since
the University's research com-
plies with federal law and the
limitations and requirements
set out in the constitutional
amendment, the state cannot
obstruct it by asking for its data.
"Our belief is that there is a
clash with what the constitu-
tional amendment requires the
University to do when perform-
ing this research, and what this
specific language (in the state's
higher education budget) has
asked," Wilbanks said.
Neither Fitzgerald, Wil-
banks, nor University Spokes-
woman Kelly Cunningham, the
University's director of public
affairs, were able to estimate
how much of the University's
state appropriation is at stake
in the budget disagreement.
The University is one of two
institutions, along with Michi-
gan State University, in the
state being scrutinized under
the provision in the fiscal year
2012 state higher education
budget.
Though Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder's budget proposal
would raise state higher educa-
tion funding 3.1 percent from

last year's budget, Coleman
and University Provost Philip
Hanlon have been critical of the
proposal's institution of perfor-
mance-based funding.
Coleman told the Senate
Advisory Committee on Uni-
versity Affairs at its meeting
last week that the performance
metrics could have "unintended
consequences" for the Univer-
sity in ignoring its strong gradu-
ate programs and research.
"We've been proposing
alternatives with every breath
we have," Coleman said at the
meeting.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-
Ann Arbor) said the recom-
mendation by the House was
a realization that the aims of
the performance metric system
may potentially harm Univer-
sity research programs. Irwin
said even the threat of stripping
the University of funding could
damage the University's abil-
ity to attract and retain world-
class researchers.
"We have, in Michigan, this
tremendous jewel which is
the University of Michigan,
where life-saving research and

cutting-edge research hap-
pens," Irwin said. "And here,
we have, in Lansing, this group
of legislators who are trying to
(involve) their religious stances
in their roles as legislators and
make Michigan's government
more closely adhere to their
interpretation of what the Bible
says. That's damaging the Uni-
versity."
Despite the threat of funding
cuts, Wilbanks and Fitzgerald
said the University would not
immediately send in the data
requested by the state Legisla-
ture.
Wilbanks stressed that the
committee's recommenda-
tion still needs to pass in the
full House and Senate, and be
signed by Snyder before the
threat materializes into a loss of
aid, adding that the bill would
likely be changed before Snyder
signs the final budget.
Fitzgerald added that the
University would stand firm in
its protection of research inita-
tives.
"At this point, we've sub-
mitted our response, and our
response will stand," he said.

Unfair ident ificat ions
SAT, ACT now require photo ID to take test
eginning this fall, high-school students across the coun-
try will be required to show photo identification in order
to register to take the SAT or the ACT. TIME magazine
reports that these photos will be printed on the students' admission
tickets to testing locations and will be sent with students' scores to
high schools and colleges. The testing services believe that the new
photo requirement will help reduce the number of students that
cheat on the tests. But the requirement does more harm than good.
The new photo requirement adds another discriminatory aspect to
an already unfair standardized testing system.

FROM THE PUBLIC EDITOR I
Abusive analysis

've noticed this happen quite
often in The Michigan Daily,
and in professional publica-
tions too. There's probably an offi-
cial term for it, but I didn't know it,
so I made up my own a few years
ago. It's very tempting for all jour-
nalists - so easy to do and so easy
to get away with. I call it "abusive
analysis." And it has to stop.
Every section of a newspaper
is susceptible to abusive analysis.
Yes, even the supposedly "just-the-
facts" news section. But the con-
cept requires explanation, so let's
start there. Simply, abusive analy-
sis is exactly what it sounds like:
taking too much liberty with anal-
ysis in journalism. It's most easily
recognizable on the language level.
when a story reads like it's "over-
written," when simple, direct
words are swapped for fancy ones
until the point is lost in the pomp,
that's classic abusive analysis.
But it need not always be only
in the language; the content itself
is sometimes an example of abu-
sive analysis. The choices the
writer makes in the narrative, and
sometimes, the story he chooses
to write in the first place, can be
abusive analysis. This one is harder
to explain, but you know it when
you see it. When the first sentence
of a simple sports cover on a gym-
nastics meet starts with a quote
from Winston Churchill on leader-
ship; or when an arts review of the
movie "Fast Five" drops a flashy
reference to Kracauer, you might
say the writer is over-thinking and
over-drafting the story, even if the
language itself is clean and simple
- abusive analysis.

The roots of this concept lie, I
think, in a phenomenon that new
writers are unaware of. What new
writers do notice in their first few
weeks at the Daily is how much
their stories are edited, reworked
and rewritten by editors. It's dis-
appointing and stressful, and in
that understandable frustration,
it's easy for new writers to miss out
on that other phenomenon occur-
ring concurrently: The writer who
drafts the first version of the story
- even if it ultimately gets rewrit-
ten entirely - sets the pace, mood
and theme of the story. That is a
considerable power, and it's wield-
ed by every writer, no matter how
young or inexperienced.
You see, regardless of how much
editors might change the language
and word choice, they are more
limited in their ability to change
the meat of the story. At the end of
the day, it's the writer who was at
the event, saw the performance or
had the initial column idea. That
core of the story that the writer
puts into his or her work is going to
be very difficult to change. But it's
very easy for a writer to make that
very core something it shouldn't be
- abusive analysis.
Writers can get away with a lot
in their stories, and I think on some
level, we all know that. Instead of
stepping back and asking what
needs to be said to tell this story,
writers sometimes get locked
into relating a particular narra-
tive, whether it works or not. As
they run out of things to say, they
engage in literary gymnastics or
pointless parallels and false com-
parisons to fill out the story. Where

the true relevant thoughts leave off
and the abusive analysis begins is
sometimes known only to the writ-
er himself. And only the writer can
really fight it.
So what is the solution to this
over-baked, false-orienting and
annoying thing I call abusive anal-
ysis? Time and effort. I know from
my own experience that writers
over-write and over-analyze to the
point of disaster when they lack
enough relevant, concrete mate-
rial for the story. And that is almost
always a result of not doing their
homework, not picking up enough
background knowledge, not focus-
ing enough on the subject and
thinking and planning before ever
sitting down to write. And that is a
fatal error.
If you've made it this far into
this column, then you might be
tempted to say that parts of this
column are arguably examples of
abusive analysis. Mine was a con-
scious effort at irony, and I think
the needy bleached nature of abu-
sive analysis is made clear in parts
of this column. It's an annoying
way to write, and we should work to
avoid it. With just a little bit more
thought and effort into laying the
background and foundation for sto-
ries, writers could be doing so much
more with those same stories.

The-photo requirement was implemented
in response to a cheating ring that involved
a college sophomore and several high-school
students in Long Island, New York. Sam
Eshaghoff, who attended the University of
Michigan as a freshman and transferred to
Emory University for his sophomore year,
took the tests for at least six students from
Great Neck North High School at a cost of
$1,500 to $2,500 per student, ABC News
reported in November, 2011.
While the cheating scandal last year was
reprehensible and should never happen again,
it's more important to consider how the addi-
tion of photos to students' college applica-
tions would affect college admission officers'
judgments of the applicants. Colleges haven't
previously asked for photos as a part of the
admissions process, so it doesn't seem appro-
priate to start asking for them now. Photos of
the applicants could lead to unfair admissions
processes for all those seeking admission,
especially since only a small fraction of the
pool of applicants consider cheating.
The fact that the cheating scandal
occurred in the first place demonstrates the
enormous importance placed on the SAT and
ACT in the college admissions process. If stu-
dents are willing to pay someone else to take
the tests for them in order to receive a high-

er score, then there are serious flaws in the
process. Two tests should not have so much
power in determining a student's academic
future after high school.
Recent evidence also shows that high SAT
or ACT scores do not necessarily determine
academic success. Cindy Babington, vice presi-
dent for student services at DePauw University
in Greencastle, Ind., told The New York Times
in February that when the university's institu-
tional research department examined factors
that correlated with academic success, "the
one thing that made no difference whatsoever
was standardized test scores."
Also, organizations such as The Posse
Foundation are working to give students with
lower standardized test scores the oppor-
tunity to attend elite colleges. According to
The New York Times, Posse Scholars enjoy a
high college graduation rate and impressive
academic progress in spite of a 1,050 median
combined SAT score.
Students' resumss, essays and high-school
grades already provide a clear representation
of the particular students' abilities. SAT and
ACT scores should not have so much influ-
ence in the college admissions process. The
new photo identification requirement could
allow for more discrimination and unfair
admission processes.

U.S. intervention in Syria can't wait

SARI KRUMHOLZ
Advocate for health reform

The second anniversary of the Affordable
Care Act has just passed. The ACA is a ground-
breakinghealth care law that not only improves
women's access to affordable quality health
care, but also has a multitude of benefits that
enable women to lead healthier lives.
Whether you are a student struggling to
pay for birth control, a mother making health
care decisions for your family or a young adult
just entering the work force, access to health
care is a priority. Now is a great opportunity
to highlight some of the health benefits of the
ACA, especially in light of political opponents
who are working to take away these benefits
and repeal the new health care law.
According to a Mar. 23 article on Minn-
Post.com, the ACA's goal is to eliminate co-
pays for women receiving health care, and to
widen the availability of preventative mea-
sures, such as birth control and testing for
breast and cervical cancer.
The ACA will end discriminatory practices
against women, who are often charged much
higher rates for health insurance than their
male counterparts. For example, according
to Planned Parenthood, a healthy 22-year-
old woman can be charged premiums up to
150 percent higher than the premiums of a
22-year-old man. In addition, some health
insurers have claimed that being pregnant
or a survivor of domestic violence is a "pre-
existing condition," thus denying these
women health care. The ACA puts a stop to
this practice.

The health care law will provide afford-
able health insurance for millions of women
that have previously gone without insurance.
Nearly 13 million women of reproductive age
will become newly eligible for health insur-
ance coverage under the ACA.
The ACA expands coverage for young
adults by allowing them to stay on their par-
ents' health plan until the age of 26. This
is especially applicable to college students
because, due to this law, they will continue to
have health insurance during the adjustment
period of graduating from school and enter-
ing the work force.
These are just some of the benefits under
the ACA. The website healthcare.gov is a
great resource to learn about all of the ben-
efits of the new health care law.
While we are fighting to secure affordable
and comprehensive health care, opponents
are attempting to repeal these benefits. If
they had their way, more women would be
uninsured, medical discrimination against
women would be legal and women would be
forced to pay more for health care than men.
We need to speak out to protect the many
benefits in the new health care law. We need
to stand with President Barack Obama in
support of the ACA. And most importantly,
we need to send a message to opponents that
health care is too important to use as a politi-
cal tool. People's lives are at stake.
Sari Krumholz is an LSA senior.

It has inexplicably taken until now, as the Syrian
opposition's death toll surges toward 10,000 and over
a year has passed since Bashar al-Assad's government
resorted to unrestricted violence to put down a previ-
ously peaceful uprising, for tangible assistance to be
provided to the Syrian resistance movement by the
Western world. Until this week, the most that inter-
national leaders could muster has consisted of a few
feeble words of condemnation and pitifully ineffec-
tive economic sanctions. But even now, the granting
of "non-lethal aid" (primarily medical supplies with
some communications equipment) by the United States
and Turkey is nowhere near enough. As British pho-
tographer Paul Conroy recently declared after escap-
ing the siege of the Syrian city of Homs, "It's not a war,
it's a massacre. An indiscriminate massacre of men,
women and children."
This uneasy hesitation should have been'expected.
Learning from the explosive consequences of heavy
Western military presence in predominantly Mus-
lim countries, it's obvious why the option of inserting
significant numbers of ground troops is off the table.
Unfortunately, the Syrian opposition is having a brutal
time of conducting the fighting themselves.
The improvised Free Syrian Army, comprised
mainly of ragtag defectors from Assad's slaughtering
ranks, has repeatedly called for foreign weapon sup-
plies to protect the civilian populace and beat back
the onslaught, but arming them could prove gravely
reckless. U.S. intelligence agencies have indicated
that al-Qaeda may be joining the uprising, complete
with suicide car bombings and the vocal support of
al-Qaeda's ringleader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. It was
even reported that at least one rebel army commander
fought against American forces in Afghanistan.
Though the major opposition groups have disavowed
ties with the terrorist network, the U.S. cannot afford
to take this risk. Historically, Washington's arming of
opposition groups has tipped the battle scales for the
benefit of immediate policy gratification, but this habit
perpetually returns to bite the government with trou-
bling human rights headaches (think the Afghan muja-
hedeen or the Indonesian army in East Timor).
The opposition Syrian National Council and Free
Army have also persistently requested a no-fly zone
such as the one that was implemented over Libya with
overwhelming success. They assert that Western air
control would immediately enable the safe defection of
tens of thousands of Assad's soldiers.
Critics retort that unlike Col. Muammar Gaddafi's
legions, the Syrian military has generally brutalized
civilians from the ground rather than with aircraft and
that armored vehicles are difficult to hit from NATO
planes without significant risk of collateral civilian
death. Thus, our leaders have shied away from this
potential action as well. But it's only a matter of time

before the opposition develops into a serious threat to
the regime's existence. It is then that Assad's air force
will swiftly join in the murder, this time, from the
skies and out of reach of the opposition's AK-47s and
RPGs. When heavy air attacks on civilians and rebels
are unleashed, it will be truly shameful if the world's
military powers continue to turn their heads.
Offensive military options are not the only weap-
ons being used by the Syrian government. Assad's
army recently planted tens of thousands of landmines
along the border with Turkey, viciously blocking a
major escape route for refugees fleeing the bloodbath.
Turkish leaders have suggested that their military
may establish a "buffer zone" on the Syrian side of the
border to generate shielded refugee escape routes, but
they refuse to do so without international security sup-
port to defend against probable attacks from Assad's
forces. This is the closest any capable nation has come
to firmly considering a viable plan for effective aid. If
Turkey continues to refuse to intervene without for-
eign security forces, then the international community
is morally obligated to provide them, even if it's only in
the form of UN peacekeeping troops.
The United States and all Western powers have
major strategic interests in endorsing these two rea-
sonable intervention options. Syrian oppositionleaders
are bound to evolve into weighty political authorities
in the future post-Assad government. To ignore their
calls for help now is to imbue in them an unforgetta-
ble memory of abandonment later. They will not soon
forget that the U.S., who in 2003, invaded their close
neighbor Iraq, and for years imposed economic sanc-
tions upon them that crippled their poor, subsequently
chose to stand idly by and watch the butchery of yet
untold thousands of their brothers, wives, cousins,
husbands, mothers and children.
It's an understatement to say that the United States
is in painful need of strong allies in the region. The lon-
ger the Syrian people are massacred, the further the
opposition may be pushed to extremist tactics and ide-
als to achieve their victory. The last thing Washington
needs is an extremist-sympathetic (or worse, radical-
ized) Syrian government grudgingly bitter about the
United States's lack of support in their revolution -
which is adjacent to Israel.
Assad will ultimately fall, but the longer he remains
in power, the higher the bodies of innocents will pile.
The implementation of a no-fly zone and the enforce-
ment of civilian escape corridors are the moment's
most logical potential courses of action, but what-
ever is done, the ultimate aim must remain restrict-
ing Assad's forces' capabilities of slaughter. As the late
Christopher Hitchens so potently wrote, "Neutrality
favors the side with the biggest arsenal."

To end problems, recognize
Israel as a Jewish state
TO THE DAILY:
I just read about a hunger strike in support
of a Palestinian that was arrested and has
not yet been prosecuted. There is something
hypocritical about today's students. How
many meals did they forfeit in protest of a very
young Israeli soldier kidnapped into Gaza,
held incommunicado for five years and finally
released in exchange for over 1,000 tried and
convicted prisoners out of Israeli jails? How
hungry were they when Palestinians blew
themselves up with nuts and bolts dipped in

poison around their waist and murdered over
1,000 Israelis? The problem in the Middle
East has lasted for over 64 years and will go on
for another 64 years unless the Arab nations
recognize that Israel is the homeland of the
Jewish people and was established so that
the Jewish people could defend themselves
against all enemies, as Iran will soon learn.
Please announce in public that Israel is a Jew-
ish nation that shall live forever in peace and
within recognized geopolitical boundaries
with Jerusalem as its capital city, and all else
will rapidly fall into place.

wrTit ten scr ipt

By MATT EASTON
Daily Film Editor
There's a certain advantage an
action film has over films of other
genres: If it's bad, it becomes
funny. Com-
pare that to the ***
purgatory of an
awful comedy Wrath of
or a muddling the Titans
drama, and it's
apparent why, At Quality 16
when a film like and Rave
"Wrath of the
Titans" most- Warner Bros.
ly misses the
mark, it still ends up being a rela-
tivelyenjoyable experience.
Sam Worthington ("Man on
a Ledge") stars as Perseus, the
reluctant hero of humanity who
is pushed into a quest to save
his father Zeus (Liam Neeson,
"The Grey") from the clutches of
Hades (Ralph Fiennes, "Coriola-
nus"), who is attempting to raise
the big baddie Kronos from his
imprisonment in Tartarus. Per-
seus is joined by a ragtag group,
including half-god Agenor (Toby
Kebbell, "War Horse") and war-
rior queen Andromeda (Rosa-
mund Pike, "The Big Year").
The story may be of question-
able Greek mythological origins,
but it has potential. The first
combat sequence, in which Per-
seus battles a Chimera, is pulse-
pounding, and it's admittedly
fun to watch Worthington put
monsters in headlocks and be
thrown about likea ragdoll. Sadly,
the action doesn't maintain, and
"Wrath" decides to focus more on
the anticipation before the fight-
ing. It doesn't work - it's more
fun to see Worthington go WWE

"Katniss learned everything she knows from me."

on creatures from hell than to see
his "range" of scared expressions.
Stone-faced Worthington is an
enigma. In scenes with his son,
Helius (newcomer John Bell), he
reminds you why his most famous
role relied on CGI emoting. But in
the moments of physical expres-
sion, he excels. Perseus, after
being thrown from the shoulders
of a Chimera, rolls on the ground
like a dad with back pain, his face
showing that it really hurts. Also,
he stays down almost a little too
long (five seconds or so), making
viewers appreciate that being a
hero isn't easy work. It's a little
funny and over-the-top, but it
feels realistic.
Surprisingly, the supporting
acting is also admirable (con-
sidering this is certainly a film
one could phone in). Choosing
Rosamund Pike to play Androm-
eda was an interesting choice,
because she isn't obviously hot
- which is a good thing. She is
more queen than model, grunting
instead of posing. Her face also
possesses a natural intelligence,
not the sort of dead-eyed Megan
Fox-ness that seems standard in
certain action films.

Fiennes and Neeson are, pre-
dictably, the true forces of the
film. Neeson (who is literally in
every movie, but no one cares
because he is so cool) is a fatherly
Zeus, delivering wisdom and
warnings in his graveled voice.
Also, it's exhilarating to watch
him saunter across battlefields,
force lightning-ing every vil-
lain in his peripheral vision. As
Hades, Fiennes delivers his lines
with such conviction - using
eyes that turn from hatred to
fear in a split-second - that you
almost forget the script.
As for the script - the horror,
the horror - no amount of act-
ing chops can save this flimsy
excuse for writing and dialogue.
In the first scene with all the
gods, they say "brother" more
times than a frat house on Friday
night (or Hulk Hogan every day
of his life). Worthington, before
he goes off to fight the final bat-
tle, declares he won't be giving
a big speech. It's meant to con-
vey that he is just a man of few
words, but it seems more like the
film's writers are copping out of
actually doing their job. Even

By RADHIKA MENON
Daily Arts Writer
When FOX's "The O.C." pre-
miered in 2003, I was a mere 12
years old. Being a typical pre-
teen, I always acted older than
I was, sticking my acne-ridden,
buck-toothed face into everyone's
business. When my older brother
started watching "The O.C.," a
show entirely targeted at his age
group and not mine, I plopped
down on the couch next to him
week in and week out, much to
his annoyance. I didn't always
completely understand the cul-
ture that was depicted or the
issues raised, but I had FOMO:
Fear of Missing Out.
I recently revisited the entire
series, but I had once again
missed the boat. I was no longer
an annoying preteen trying to
fit into a much more grown-up
world;rather,Iam nowin college,
having already worked through
the irritations of adolescence.
The show still resonated.
"The O.C." falls into the cat-
egory of teen drama and is often-
times paired with its reality-TV
sister show "Laguna Beach."
But "The O.C." goes deeper into
character development, teenage
conflicts and societal issues than
"Laguna" ever managed.
"The O.C." depicts the lives of
wealthy teenagers in Southern
California. At the surface, the
show doesn't appeal to much of
middle America: We don't live
in opulence like the Cohens, nor
have many of us felt the sense
of loss and hardship that Ryan
Atwood has had to endure - and
if we have, how many of us have
been "saved" by an altruistic
attorney like Sandy Cohen? Yet,
there's something about waking
up to Sandy's bagel shmear and
Seth's comic book collection that
just feels like home.
At the core of it, "The O.C."
is a show about teenagers navi-
gating the world as best as they
can. Seth is a self-professed nerd
who doesn't fit in at school and
essentially has no friends until
his father brings Ryan home with
him one day. Ryan, a troubled kid
with agood heart from the wrong
side of town, has never felt the
warmth of a real family until the
Cohens take him in. Marissa is a

'U' to hire four new deans
after slew of resignations

University students play with a dog at the Puppies on the Porch event on Friday.

Copper, a beagle mix, wandered
around anxiously, dodging the
adoring squeals of girls and the
mob of hands that reached down
to pet him at the Puppies on
the Porch fundraiser hosted by
the Pi Beta Phi sorority and the
Sigma Chi fraternity on Friday.
More than 300 people attend-
ed the event, which raised
money for the Greek organiza-
tions' principle philanthropies,

books for low-income families,
and the Huntsman Cancer Foun-
DETROIT
From Page 1A
Schumack said the majority of
the houses in the neighborhood
were built in the 1930s to accom-
modate the influx of workers that
came to Detroit to work in the
then booming automobile indus-
try, but the homes were never
intended to be permanent struc-
tures. Many of the houses, even
the inhabited ones, are in poor
shape due to years of neglect or
abandonment, but according to
Schumack, the goal of the proj-
ect is to make the neighborhood
safer and nicer for the remaining
residents.
"The alternative is unaccept-
able to me under any circum-
stances," he said. "You'll have
one or two houses on a street that
are still inhabited, surrounded by
burned out, trash-filled, danger-
ous structures and drug houses
and prostitutes. Your children
have to walk by that every day on
their way to school ... That's the
alternative."
In the same neighborhood,
Hannah Smotrich, an associate
professor at the School, of Art &
Design, worked with University
students to strip the outside of an
abandoned house and replace the

dation. Proceeds also went to
the Lenawee Humane Society,
a non-profit, no-kill shelter in
Adrian, Mich.
The 12 puppies that partici-
pated in the event came from
the Lenawee Humane Society,
which manages 108 animals on a
budget of $27,000 a month.
LSA sophomore Sarah Gil-
berg, vice president of philan-
thropy for Pi Beta Phi, said she
was glad that her sorority came
together with Sigma Chi to put
on the event.
"Well, everyone loves puppies
and we thought that this would
be a good event to fundraise for
our philanthropy," Gilberg said.
Sasha Wilkerson, assistant
shelter manager at Lenawee
Humane Society, said she hopes
that the event was successful in
raising awareness about aban-
doned animals.
"(We want) to give a lot more
siding with large painted boards
with a map of rehabilitation,
demolition and gardening proj-
ects in the area. The work is part
of a semester-long project with
Neighbors Building Brightmoor.
"We came up with a concept
of what could be on the sides,
what could be useful to the com-
munity," Smotrich said. "They
would really like almost a'visitor
center' in a way ... it would be fun
to have an orientation for people
who don't live here."
At another site in Detroit, stu-
dents worked to help demolish
a series of houses to make way
for a community garden. Busi-
ness Senior Chris Sefcheck, who
volunteered with Phi Chi Theta,
a co-ed business and econom-
ics professional fraternity, said
he expanded his commitment
through the Detroit Partnership
to work on a weekly basis tutor-
ing elementary school students
in Detroit.
"It's very rewarding, it's great
to work one on one with the
kids," Sefcheck said.
At the end of the day, all of
the participants gathered in Sto-
epel Park near Detroit's west-
side to hear from community
leaders and activists about con-
tinuing projects and their appre-
ciation for the volunteers' time in

exposure and let people know
that there is this problem going
on," Wilkerson said. "There are
animals that need our help, so
the more people that can help,
the better."
LSA junior Anna Peters, a
member of the Zeta Tau Alpha
sorority, said she was excited to
see the puppies, adding that the
event was a unique method to
raise money for charity.
"This is an awesome way to
raise money for their philan-
thropies ... Everyone wants to
see puppies," she said.
LSA junior Olivia Roser said
that as a member of a sorority, it
was a great opportunity to sup-
port other Greek organizations.
"It is good to support other
Greek organizations' charity
events," she said. "It won't work
unless we have people that come
to our (events) and we go to
other organizations' (events)."
Detroit.
Speakers included Detroit
City Council members Saunteel
Jenkins and James Tate, Albert
Rush, pastor at West Outer
Drive United Methodist Church,
spoken-word artist Walter Lacy,
longtime community activist
Ron Scott and former Michigan
football coach Lloyd Carr.
"There's so many positive
things going on in Detroit," Jen-
kins told the crowd. "Detroit is a
delicate city. Just like we're full
of challenges, we're even more
full of opportunity."
After attending his first DP
Day last year, Carr said the num-
ber of students volunteering and
the variety of projects through-
out the city through the partner-
ship has continued to impress
him. He added that his message
to students was to keep contrib-
uting to their communities in
any way possible.
"You have to come here to
really see what it is all about,"
Carr said. "My message is that
you can't do everything, but
you can do something. We're
not going to rebuild the city of
Detroit in one day, or one year,
or one decade, (but) I want to
emphasize that what they're
doing is something and it's
important."

Dentistry, Law,
Library, LSA deans
to leave posts in
2013
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
Come 2013, the University
will have four new deans to help
lead the institution. At a Mar.
26 meeting of the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs, University Provost Phil-
lip Hanlon announced that four
deans - Dean of Libraries Paul
Courant, Law School Dean Evan
Caminker, Dentistry School
Dean Peter Polverini and LSA
Dean Terrence McDonald - will
step down from their positions
followingthe next school year.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said Hanlon will
appoint four different search
committees of faculty and stu-
dents to find a new dean for
each school. He explained that
an active University dean will
help guide the committee's rec-
ommendation and inform the
committee about the role of a
University dean.
Fitzgerald said each search
committee will then submit
three candidates to Hanlon and
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, who will make the
final decisions.
McDonald, Caminker and
Polverini, who have been deans
since 2003, will have all served
two five-year terms when they
step down. Courant will have
served a five-year term and an
18-month term.
Fitzgerald said deans normal-
ly serve two five-year terms and
added that this transition is typi-
cal. He explained that Courant
requested to step down after 18
months instead of completing
his second five-year term.
Courant wrote in an e-mail
interview that during his tenure
as dean, he has helped move the
library into a position to take
advantage of "digital technolo-
gies in the academic world."
"It was and is a struggle and
we have not moved as far as I
had hoped," Courant wrote.
Courant wrote that he is
proud of his work improving

the physical environment of the
University libraries.
"(We were able to) create
welcoming and productive
spaces for students and faculty
to hang out and work, and for
the broader community to enjoy
the libraries treasures and con-
tributions by faculty, students
and visitors," he wrote.
After almost 30 years serving
as University provost, director
of the Institute of Public Policy
Studies and chair of the eco-
nomics department, Courant
wrote that he plans to return to
teaching and researching at the
University.
"I want to ... while I've still
got some energy," he wrote.
Law School Dean Caminker
said he has been satisfied with
his work in improving and
expanding the facilities of the
Law School.
"We are very pleased to have
expanded and updated and
modified the building spaces for
appropriate 21st century legal
pedagogy," he said.
Caminker added that he
helped transition the Law School
to focus on teaching skills-based
learning by providing opportuni-
ties for law students to have real-
world clients and participate in
simulation courses.
"(They are) all designed to
make sure our students not only
think like lawyers, but actually
learn how to be lawyers so they
can hit the ground running," he
said.
Caminker said he hopes his
successor continues the Law
School's emphasis on the learn-
ing initiatives he promoted dur-
ing his tenure.
"There are some potentially
significant changes in the legal
profession right now that (will)
likely influence the way law
schools ought to prepare stu-
dents for practice," he said.
After his service as dean,
Caminker said he will step
down to teach and conduct
research as a faculty member at
the Law School.
Polverini said he has found
the success of his faculty to
be the most rewarding part of
being a dean. He added that
he is proud of the innovative
research by his faculty, com-
menting specifically on the
research on regenerative medi-

cine.
"Any dean measures his or
her success on other peoples'
success," he said.
Polverini said despite an
increase in funding from the
National Institutes of Health,
tough economic conditions have
made it difficult to invest in
research. Still, he said the Dental
School's investments have paid
off.
He added that he is glad
for the independence that the
administration has given him
involving research programs.
"They certainly have provid-
ed some important guidance,"
he said. "They have been very
supportive of what we do."
Polverini said after his ten-
ure is finished, he would rather
help shape health care policy
in the dental field than return
to research, adding this would
require an increase in preventa-
tive care and education.
"My goal is to do something
entirely different," he said. "(I
want) to try and look how we
can operationalize the evolving
field of perspective health care
in dentistry."
McDonald wrote in a letter to
LSA faculty and staff that he is
proud to have served as dean.
"I have found my time in
deanship to be endlessly inter-
esting, energizing and inspir-
ing," he wrote.
McDonald wrote that he feels
his accomplishments include
hiring distinguished faculty and
expanding the number of tenure
track faculty by 10 percent.
"The foundation of our suc-
cess has been an enormous
and continuous investment in
faculty," he wrote. "We have
enlivened the intellectual atmo-
sphere on campus."
McDonald added thathe is also
pleased to have invested in the
infrastructure of LSA. He stated
that more than $70 million have
been spent to improve classrooms
and learning spaces, including
$1.5 million that were invested in
building a wireless network.
After nearly a decade as dean,
McDonald wrote that he plans
to return to teaching.
"It has been a privilege to be
your dean but most importantly
to me, to be, first and always,
your faculty colleague," he
wrote.

After splitting the dou-

Wolverines

came INDIANA 7
back with
a 7-2 win MICHIGAN 7
on Sun- INDIANA 2
day to
take two games of the three-
game series against Indiana
(2-4,17-17).
Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins emphasized the
importance of bouncing back
from a tough loss, especial-
ly since it's hard to sweep a
three-game series. Hutchins
was pleased that her team
came back Sunday and won in
convincing fashion.
And so was junior second
baseman Ashley Lane, whose
2-for-4, 4-RBI performance
was a significant boost to the
offense on Sunday.
"It feels great (to come back
and win)," Lane said. "We just
played as a team (Sunday),
we kind of felt off (Saturday).
Things weren't quite working
for us, and (Sunday), we came
with a fresh look and we got
the job done."
The Wolverines got on the
board early in Sunday's match-
up with an RBI single by Lane
in the first inning. And in the
third, the Escondido, Calif.
native hit a three-run homer to
right field to put Michigan up,
4-0.
Along with Lane, sophomore
right fielder Lyndsay Doyle
highlighted the afternoon,
going 3-for-4 with an RBI.
Senior first baseman Amanda
Chidester added a solo shot in
the sixth, and one more run in

the seventh to round out the
scoring for Michigan.
Hutchins noted that
Chidester's leadership was out-
standing over the weekend, and
Doyle said Chidester and Lane
were integral in the Wolverine
offense in the third game of the
weekend.
"I think this weekend, both
of them together, they just did
awesome," Doyle said. "Any
time we were in scoring posi-
tion, the majority of the time
they batted us in, and that's
really key for us to win games."
While the Wolverine offense
was getting back in stride,
freshman lefty Haylie Wagner
stalled the Hoosier offense with
her performance in the circle.
With Sunday's victory, Wagner
moved to 17-4 on the season,
giving up one earned run on six
hits in a full seven innings.
Though Wagner's efforts
may have helped the Wolver-
ines pull out the series win,

she struggled in Saturday's
second game when she came
in as relief for fellow fresh-
man Sara Driesenga. Indiana
loaded the bases with two outs
in the third, and two straight
walks by Driesenga forced
Hutchins to put in Wagner.
But Wagner walked one more,
giving the Hoosiers a 3-0 lead
heading into the fourth inning.
And in the fifth inning,
Wagner gave up two singles
before facing Indiana junior
infielder Amanda Wagner,
who crushed a three-run shot
to force Hutchins to make yet
another pitching change. She
brought in senior lefty Hil-
ary Payne, whose 1.1 innings of
work was the most she's seen
all season.
But the lack of offensive
production ultimately spelled
defeat for Michigan.
"It was a little bit of every-
thing," Lane said. "We just
didn't have our A-game. We

were off on both sides of the
field, (and) everything wasn't
clicking for us."
Hutchins wasn't impressed
with Wagner's performance in
Saturday's loss but was satis-
fied with how she came back on
Sunday.
Lane understands the pres-
sure Wagner has faced all sea-
son.
"(Wagner is) a very strong
girl," Lane said. "She keeps her
composure, (but) she needs
situations like (Saturday's loss)
when things aren't going her
way just to make her stronger
and build up her toughness."
Wagner had an easier time
in Saturday's first game, giving
up two runs in 5.1 innings, and
her teammates helped her out
on offense. Senior shortstop
Stephanie Kirkpatrick and Lane
hit solo home runs, and Doyle
scored on an Indiana error to
give the Wolverines a 3-2 vic-
tory.

Ailing Bernstein boosts Wolverines

By ALEX STEINHOFF
Daily Sports Writer
Rarely are two matches in one
weekend alike. But this week-
end, the Michigan men's tennis
team played two dual matches
that could've been replays of each
other.
On Saturday, the Wolverines
stormed from behind in doubles
to win the point before claiming
four singles matches against Pur-
due (1-3 Big Ten, 7-9 overall). The
next day against No. 23 Indiana,
Michigan (4-1, 11-5) rallied again
in doubles to take the point. In
singles, four Wolverines clinched
to win another dual, 5-2.
Atthebeginningofeachmatch,
it wasn't looking good for Michi-
gan. On Saturday, No. 2 doubles
sophomores Barrett Franks
and Alex Buzzi were down two
breaks late in the pro-set, and the
No.1 pair of junior Ryan King and
sophomore Shaun Bernstein was
down 5-1. In addition, Michigan's,
early lead at No. 3 doubles started
to disappear.
But then, things started to look
up. Though Franks and Buzzi lost
their pro-set, 8-3, No. 1 and No.
3 started playing better. Down
5-1, King and Bernstein broke
the Boilermakers' serve right
after Bernstein held serve. After

week, Bernstein was forced to
serve underhand - something
he'd been working on all week in
practice.
With the score knotted at five
games apiece, it was Bernstein's
turn to serve again. Like the last
game, Bernstein held his serve,
giving the pair its first lead of the

set.
"You feel like you should be
able to hit a winner on (that
underhanded serve), but it's
tricky because it stays so low,"
said Michigan coach Bruce Ber-
que. "The ball is moving slow and
it stays low, so it gives (Bernstein)
time to get to the net. It's not as
easy as it looks to handle it."

After breaking Purdue's serve
for the third time in a row, King
had the opportunity to serve for
the set. The hungry Wolverines
didn't hesitate, and Bernstein fin-
ished the set off with a volley that
hit the Purdue player on the foot.
The crowd erupted in response.

you know-
what the mar-
riage is going to be like."
Life and tandem biking aren't
so different, after all.
Life led Hakken to a small,
two-stall shop in a plaza off Plym-
outh Road near North Campus,
where Hakken sells and repairs
bicycles, primarily tandem bikes.
The man, who grew up down the
street from Bo Schembechler in
Ann Arbor, hasa tired, weath-
ered face and hands that look
as thoughthey're familiar with
handy work.
Not every customer knows
what they're looking for when
they find him. Some do; others
stumble upon Hakken's passion,
Midwest Bike & Tandem, and walk
out having enjoyed a healthy con-
versation and traded new ideas.
Not of bikes, but of life, Hakken's
hometown, its people and its
school.
"Half the time, I don't know
what he's talking about," said
Hakken's son, Dylan, who had
been busy fixing a deep-blue-col-
ored tandem bike, and who lov-
ingly called his father a hippie.
In the 1970s, before his first
tandem, Hakken indulged his first
love studying fine-art photogra-
phy at Michigan. He practiced
as a professional photographer
briefly, then decided to get his
graduate degree, also in fine-art
photography, at Ohio University.
To scratch his itch after col-
lege, Hakken taught part time at
Washtenaw Community College
and started his own business
selling and renting photography
equipmenton the side. Hakken
was married and enjoyed bike rid-
ing in his free time.
"My wife and I rode at two dif-
ferent speeds. So we said, let's get
a tandem and we can ride togeth-
er," Hakken said.
Tandem bikes are romantic
at their essence, Hakken says.
With a normal-bicycle look, but
extended and built for two, it
takes teamwork, coordination,
trust and communication for the
captain - who controls the steer-
ing, sitting in front - and his or
her partner to ride painlessly.
Hakken surely imagined sum-
mer afternoons spent biking
serenely around Ann Arbor with
his wife when his photography
business took off, and he sold it
for enough money that he thought
he could retire. But five years
after his first tandem purchase,

With similar passion, he had
sworn to his mother that he
would never marry again. Then
he met Wendy, a Ford Motor

doors down and who said "sure"
when Hakken asked her to ride

ably together.
They weda few years later and
decided their wedding present
would be a tandem. They settled
on a bike that had been built

in Eugene, Ore. Since they had
friends in Seattle, they planned to
visit and pick it up from the man-

Always a people person, Hak-
ken met everyone who worked at

owner, who complained about the
company's lacking presence in

Hakken said, "Well, I'll see

later, Co-Motion came to him.
"They said, 'Just open a store,

own store,"' Hakken said. "That's
how we started."
Since September 2008, Mid-

his creative side by designing
bikes for Co-Motion and build-
ing prototypes himself: In 2010,

he entered a remarkably light
20-pound tandem in the North
American Handmade Bicycle
Show in Richmond, Va.
Currently, Co-Motion is build-

modifications, Hakken said.
For him and Wendy, the wed-

getting out on the bike, getting
away from phones and enjoying

Third doubles pair sparks Michigan win

By JEFF KAPLAN
For the Daily
When the No. 1 doubles team
for the Michigan men's tennis
team, consisting of junior Evan
King and sophomore Shaun Bern-
stein, went down 5-1 on Saturday
against Purdue, the weekend was
already off to a bad start. But due
to the play of the No. 3 doubles
team and a comeback from King
and Bernstein, the Wolverines
were able to turn their poor start
into two decisive wins.
"(The weekend) was great, "
said coach Bruce Berque. "Pur-
due and Indiana are both talented
teams. Indiana, we lost on the road
to last year, 4-3, so that's always
more satisfying."
On Saturday, the Wolverines
defeated Purdue (1-2 Big Ten, 7-8
overall), 5-2, then followed that
up with another 5-2 victory on
Sunday against Indiana (2-3,14-7).
Both of these victories included
winning the doubles point, which
allowed Michigan (4-1, 11-5) to
take a lead into the singles match-
es.
The decisive victory in the dou-
bles match on Saturday came from
the No. 3 team of freshmen Alex
Petrone and Michael Zhu. After

getting out to a 2-1 lead, the third
pairing never looked back, cruis-
ingto an 8-5 victory.
"I think the doubles point was
big," Berque said. "We would have
been confident that we would have
had a great chance to come back,
but we took an educated gamble to
take Shaun out of the lineup. And
having won the doubles, we were

energy up. I got a little tight serv-
ing for it and was up 5-4 in the sec-
ond, but (I) regrouped and got the

Zhu was also forced to play up,
moving from the No. 4 spot to the
No. 3 spot. Just like Petrone, Zhu
didn't miss a beat, winning, 7-5,
6-3.
"I think (Zhu's) really learning
everythingthat's involved in com-
peting at a high level in college
tennis, even when he's not hitting
the ball at hisbest," Berque said. "I
think that's his biggest thing that
he needs to learn, but he is defi-
nitely learning it. He was the lead-
er in doubles on that court, like he
has been so many times."
With Bernstein back in the line-
up on Sunday, both freshmen were
able to secure a victory. Zhu won,
6-2, 4-6 (10-8), and Petrone, 6-2,
6-0. With only conference match-
ups remaining, both Petrone and
Zhu will need to keep playing
with the same vigor, especially
next weekend, with the team trav-
eling to powerhouses Illinois and
Northwestern. Berque has confi-
dence the pairwill keep itup.
"They are competing really
well," Berque said. "They figured
out what they're good at and what
they're not as good at."

WOMEN'S ROWING
Michigan rowing squad scores nine victories in Columbus

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
For the Daily
The Michigan women's row-
ing team adopted a more rigorous
training program over the win-
ter, and it paid off on Saturday as
the third-ranked Wolverines won
nine events at Griggs Reservoir in
Columbus.
A week after defeating Princ-
eton and defending national
champion Brown, both of the
Wolverines' varsity-eight squads
went unbeaten, sweeping No. 12
Michigan State and No. 9 Yale. In
the morning, the first varsity-eight
rowed 6:18.10, outpacing its rival
from East Lansing (6:30.69). The

secondvarsity-eight followedwith
a time of 6:32.24, overwhelming
the Spartans by almost 28 seconds
(6:50.15). Later in the day, the first
varsity-eight (6:16.7) defeated Yale
(6:28.92) and the second varsity-
eight (6:25.62) followed suit.
The second varsity-eight has
yet to lose this year.
"I'm pleased with our per-
formance," said Michigan sec-
ond-varsity senior Ariel Piotter.
"We have a remarkable group of
seniors, and we've really come
together."
Michigan coach Mark Roth-
stein praised the grit of the sec-
ond-varsity squad, highlighting
Piotter's effort all season long.

helped tremendously."
After Michigan's impressive
performances against Princeton
and Brown last weekend, first-var-
sity coxswain Colleen Macke said
the team struggled at first to focus
for the competition in Columbus.
Then, the players decided to use
the matchup against arch-rival
Michigan State as motivation.
"It's always a big deal for us to
face them and to come home with
a win, so it helped us refocus in
practice," Macke said.
While Rothstein was happy
with Michigan's performance,
he stressed that the Wolverines
are not competing at the level he
expects. He noted several techni-

cal issues that he hopes his new
training program will alleviate
quickly.
"It was a good day, but all of our
boats have improvements we need
to make," Rothstein said.
Michigan will next hit the
water in Iowa City on Saturday,
where it will face Iowa and Lou-
isville. The women's rowing team
will then host its only home event
of the season on April 14th, as the
Wolverines continue their prepa-
ration for the Big Ten Champion-
ships.
"We have a lot of seniors, and
this is their last chance to win a Big
Ten Championship," Macke said.
"We're doing it for the seniors."

and Michael Zhu at No. 3 doubles.
"Definitely, throughout the
beginning, everybody seemed
to be struggling," Zhu said. "But
when (King) and (Bernstein)
won, we definitely got motivated
to win. Itwas like seeingthatlight
at the end of the tunnel."
Zhu and Petrone saw their
break lead turn into a 6-5 nail-
biter, but broke right back to take
a 7-5 lead. In the final game of the
pro-set, Zhu hit what he thought
was a service winner. He and
Petrone celebrated, but the Boil-
ermakers called the serve out,
to Zhu's disbelief. After a min-
ute of debate with himself, the
line judge overruled the call and
deemed the serve in, awarding
the point, set, and doubles point
to Michigan.
"With Bernstein out of the
lineup, everybody definitely has
to step up if we want to win,"
Petrone said. "(Bernstein) did a
great job serving underhand and
winning that doubles match, and
that could've been the difference.
If we didn't win that doubles
point, who knows what would've
happened."
Against Indiana (2-3, 14-7) on

Sunday, Michigan split doubles
matches at No. 1 and No. 2, leav-
ing the point up to the freshman
pair at No. 3. Like Saturday, they
responded to the pressure and got
the job done for the Wolverines.
At 7-7 in the pro-set, Petrone
and Zhu were down 0-40. The
freshman duo won the next nine
points to take an 8-7 lead, before
breaking Indiana's serve to win
the pro-set and doubles point.
"They're good at adjusting
their strategy to their strengths,"
Berque said. "You had two seniors
against two freshmen, and I
thought our guys did terrific,
competing really well under pres-
sure two days in a row."
On each day, Michigan car-
ried its momentum into singles.
At No. 1 singles, King made quick
work of Szymon Tatarczyk, one of
Purdue's six foreign-born players.
King won ten straight games en
route to a straight-set victory over
the Poland native.
King did nothing different on
Sunday against Isade Juneau,
winning a 6-1, 6-1 decision that
was filled with flashy winners,
impressive serves and few errors
from King.
Because Michigan won the
doubles point, Berque took a
calculated risk on Saturday and
decided to rest Bernstein. As a

result, every Wolverine singles
player except King was moved
one spot up in the lineup to
replace Bernstein at No. 2 singles.
The move showed Berque's con-
fidence in his young team, and it
also paid off.
Petrone and Zhu, at No. 2 and
No. 3 singles, respectively, deliv-
ered straight-set victories for the
Wolverines, not even blinking
about playing higher in the lineup
than ever before. Petrone defeat-
ed Purdue sophomore Mark
Kovacs, 6-2, 7-5, despite a late
second-set scare that saw Petrone
squander a chance to serve for the
set at 5-4. Zhu finished off fresh-
man Diego Acosta with a volley
winner on match point, 7-5,6-3.
"To win at No. 2 and No. 3 for
those guys is great," Berque said.
"We had a lot of confidence in
their skills when we were recruit-
ing them, but that's a lot to ask of
two guys like that to be winning
so high in the lineup, but they're
getting better every time."
On Sunday, Berque thought
that Bernstein would match up
well with his opponentfromIndi-
ana. But Bernstein wasn't able to
hold serve once and was defeat-
ed 6-1, 6-1. Bernstein - whose
shoulder has been bothering him
since late last week - hopes tobe
healthy by next week.

Because Bernstein was in the
lineup on Sunday, Petrone and
Zhu were pushed back down to
No. 3 and No. 4. Petrone won in
dominating fashion, while Zhu
squeaked out a match in the
third-setwinning a ten-point tie-
breaker.
Only Buzzi, at No. 5, was able
to win for the Wolverines, in the
final three singles matches. But
that was all Michigan needed,
as any other victory would have
simply padded the stats for the
Wolverines.
Buzzi won again Sunday,
clinching the dual victory over
Indiana. Buzzi cruised in the first
set but struggled to close out his
opponent.
At one point, Buzzi was down
two set points in the second set.
But with the match on the line,
Buzzi held serve to give Michigan
the dual victory for the second-
straight day.
The win marks the Wolverines'
seventh in eight contests, good for
atie for second in the BigTen.
"To come away with two wins
against two good teams was
great," Berque said. "We don't
have a big squad, and we've got a
youngsquad, and (Bernstein) was
banged up. I am really pleased to
come away with two wins in the
Big Ten against two good teams."

large part to its inability to
respond to the 5-1 deficit it found
itself in at the end of the first
quarter and its failure to stop
Cohen. Cohen matched the total
offensive production of the Wol-
verines with seven goals, leading
a scoring run in the first quarter,
and producing his own three-
goal run in the third.
The seven-goal performance
by Cohen was something that the
Wolverines had yet to see before
this season, but they know they
will have to learn how to stop
other players with his talent in
the future.
"We are going to come up
against plenty of opponents of
(Cohen's) caliber," said Michigan
coach John Paul. "The differ-
ence between a great player like
(Cohen), and the other players
on any team is that when he does
get opportunities, he is probably
going to finish."
The Wolverines, on the other
hand, didn't rely on one main
scorer, instead spreading out
their scoring among freshman
attackman David McCormack,
senior attackman Trevor Yealy
and junior attackman Thomas
Paras, who each had two goals.

Bryant tallied another goal and

For the Daily
Chris Whitten's job has not
been easy this year.
The Michigan men's golf coach
lost Lion Kim - the Wolverines'
top scorer of the 2010-11 season,
and a Masters participant, to
boot - and fellow senior Alex-
ander Sitompul to graduation,
while Joey Garber - last season's
freshman standout who started
every tournament last year and
was third on the team in scoring
average - transferred to the Uni-
versity of Georgia.
Whitten's had to face all of
this, while also learning the
ropes asa first-year head coach.
Andrew Sapp, Michigan's for-
mer coach, left after last season
to coach the University of North
Carolina men's team.
In the face of adversity, Whit-
ten has looked to his lone senior,
Matt Thompson, for leadership
on and off the course.
"Having Matt on the team
really makes things a lot easier,
because he's such a leader on the
course and with the guys," Whit-
ten said. "They can all see what
he does at home and (they can)
see why he plays so well."
Two weeks ago, Thompson
contributed a stellar 10-under
performance for Michigan at the
Furman Intercollegiate, finishing
in second place for the 54-hole
event - his third top-two finish
of the year. He led the Wolverines
to a 16th-place finish overall.
But this week, Thompson fin-
ished at six-over-par and 20th
individually at the LSU Intercol-
legiate in Baton Rouge, La.
"(On Saturday), I was fighting
all day to put everything togeth-
er," Thompson said. "Every time
I thought I was climbing back
into it, I would make another
bogey. I just couldn't really get
into a rhythm."
Thompson fared better on
Sunday, shooting an even-par
72, even after bogeying his final
three holes.
"(Matt) maybe tried to force it
a little bit," Whitten said. "(How-
ever), he's such a good player that
he can make those decisions.
He had a green light and it just
didn't work out this time, but that
doesn't really reflect where his
game is at. ... We don't (focus on)
results, we talk more about the
process,just getting prepared."
After a steady first half of the
year for the Wolverines - a peri-
od where Thompson finished in

the top-10 three times, including
a victory at the Windon Memo-
rial Classic in mid-October -
the spring season has seen them
precipitously drop out of NCAA
contention. If Michigan wants
to extend its four-year NCAA
Regional streak, it'll have to win
the Big Ten Championships in
French Lick, Ind. in four weeks
to receive the automatic bid.
The Wolverines will have to
play better than they did in Loui-
siana this weekend, where the
team finished in a tie for tenth
with a three-round total of 907
(+43).
"I'd say, overall, our perfor-
mance (this weekend) was well
below expectations," Whitten
said. "We're learning new things
every week, but we've still got a
lot of things to get better at."
Whitten is still optimistic that
his players will have an opportu-
nity to play at their home course
in May.
"I don't think there's any rea-
son that we can't go into (Big
Tens) with high expectations,"
Whitten said. "We're hoping to
do something special."
If optimism isn't enough,
Whitten should find solace that

the Big Ten Championships in
Bloomington, where they were

for a single round all season.
By 2008, Sapp had led Michi-
gan to its first NCAA Regional in
eight years. In 2009 - Thomp-

ing to eventual champion Texas
A&M in the semifinals. Thomp-*0

sons saw similar results. The
Wolverines made it to the NCAA
Regional each year, winning the
Central Regional last season.
"It's been difficult, especially
after my first three years - where
we've been and where we came
from," Thompson said. "Nobody
likes to lose."
With roster attrition and a
first-year coach, sustaining its
past success on the course has
proven to be easier said than
done for the Michigan men's
team. But Thompson is confi-
dent in the coaching staff moving
forward, even if the Wolverines
fail to reach their fifth-straight
NCAA Regional.

good groundwork here," Whitten
said. "I think everything we're

going forward."

could for my teammates, because
that is all I could really do. I ended
up figuring itout, playingwell and

It's a little surprising that a
squad dominated by freshmen
has performed so well - the Wol-
verines are the highest-ranked
Big Ten team. But this road trip
served as a reminder that these
still are first-year players.
"This weekend was our first
bus ride down, and that was a new
experience for me, being a fresh-
man," Dodge said. "It's always
nice to win at home, but it's nice to
win at matches that are away. It's
a good feeling."
These freshmen have already
proven themselves forces to be
reckoned with, and they seem to
promise even better things once
they mature as players. But for
now, Bernstein is focusing her
team on next weekend against
Illinois and Northwestern at
home, which could make or break
Michigan's current record.
"Walking out with two wins
was what our goal was, but defi-
nitely a wake up call," Bernstein
said. "We were fortunate to get
through today for sure, which I
guess is a goodsign that we fought
through it, but we have got to get
a lot better before next weekend."
