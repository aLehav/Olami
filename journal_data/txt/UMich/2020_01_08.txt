Every Saturday morning since 
September 2003, members of 
Witnesses For Peace — an anti-
Israel protest group — have 
stood outside the Beth Israel 
Congregation 
on 
Washtenaw 
Avenue in Ann Arbor. Members 

of the group hold signs reading 
“Resist Jewish Power,” “Jewish 
Power 
Corrupts,” 
“Boycott 
Israel,” “Stop U.S. Aid to Israel” 
and 
“End 
the 
Palestinian 
holocaust.” Their demonstrations 
last from about 9:30 to 11:30 a.m., 
taking place during Shabbat 
services. 
After 16 years and more 
than 
800 
protests, 
a 
Beth 
Israel 
Congregation 
member, 
Marvin Gerber, motioned to 

sue the group on Dec. 19, 2019, 
claiming Witnesses For Peace 
have demonstrated anti-Semitic 
rhetoric. The lawsuit also claims 
the city of Ann Arbor has not 
taken the appropriate action to 
put an end to the demonstrations.
According to the litigation, 
the protests defy Ann Arbor 
regulations on public gatherings 
and stretch the legal limits on 
a person’s right to free speech. 
Gerber requested the city either 

eliminate the protest altogether 
or install certain restrictions. The 
plaintiff is also seeking financial 
retribution due to the protester’s 
constant “harassment.”
“The First Amendment right 
of free speech does not entitle 
a speaker to use that right 
repeatedly 
to 
bludgeon, 
for 
weeks and years at a time, in the 
same location,” the lawsuit reads. 

Lewis Raven Wallace, an 
independent 
journalist 
from 
North 
Carolina, 
spoke 
at 
Literati Bookstore on Tuesday 
evening to a crowd of about 
70 people. Wallace discussed 
his new book “The View from 
Somewhere: Undoing the Myth 
of Journalistic Objectivity” at an 
event sponsored by the store. 
Wallace is an Ann Arbor 
native who turned his activism 
to journalism. He currently 
hosts his own podcast, “The 
View from Somewhere.” In 

addition, Wallace started his 
own 
company 
called 
Press 
On, 
a 
Southern 
journalism 
collective 
providing 
training 
and education about challenging 
harmful bias in the journalism 
industry. 
During the book reading, 
Wallace 
read 
passages 
describing how his early career 
as a journalist was affected 
by the LGBTQ+ activism he 
participated in as a teenager. 
The excerpts detailed how he 
was fired from a job at a daily 
paper when he wrote a blog post 
titled “Objectivity Is Dead and 
I’m Okay With It,” which would 
come to define the rest of his 

career. 
Wallace, who is transgender, 
said 
he 
knew 
his 
opinion 
about 
objectivity 
would 
be 
controversial but did not realize 
the extent to which it would 
change his career.
“I wrote about my experience 
as a transgender journalist, never 
neutral on the subject of my 
own humanity and rights, even 
as they were being debated in 
‘both sides’ journalism,” Wallace 
said. “When I posted the blog, I 
knew it might be controversial. 
What I didn’t know was how 
dramatically it would change 
the trajectory of my life, as my 
own story became part of a tense 

national conversation over truth 
and journalism.”
Art & Design senior Brooks 
Eisenbise said it is important to 
challenge the idea of journalistic 
objectivity. 
“I like the message of pushing 
against journalistic objectivity 
because I feel like in our current 
fact climate where people can 
say whatever, it takes more 
than objectivity to tell people 
the truth and to know what’s 
real and what’s not,” Eisenbise 
said. “Talking to the source 
and talking with people on the 
ground is important. Telling the 
full story is really cool.”

A 
team 
of 
University 
of 
Michigan 
faculty 
and 
students have created iGYM, 
an augmented reality system 
allowing 
both 
able-bodied 
individuals and those with 
mobile disabilities to engage in 
physical games together. 
iGYM is designed to mimic 
physical sports by projecting 
an interactive court onto the 
floor. It can host multiple 
games featuring virtual goals 
and balls. Players interact with 
the projections to virtually kick 
and pass the ball to score goals.
Art 
& 
Design 
professor 
Roland Graf, one of the team’s 
leaders, said the game creates 
an 
even 
playing 
field 
for 
children with disabilities so 
they can compete and play with 
their able-bodied peers.
The 
team 
consisted 
of 
students and faculty from the 
School of Art & Design, the 
School of Information, 
the 
College of Engineering and 
the 
School 
of 
Kinesiology. 
Graf stressed the importance 
of having an interdisciplinary 
team to bring the research 
project to life.
“What united us was really 
a shared mission,” Graf said. 

Good news for stressed-out 
students: there may be a link 
between stress in early life and 
longer lifespans, according to 
researchers at the University of 
Michigan.
The research is being conducted 
at the Jakob Lab, a molecular, 
cellular and developmental biology 
laboratory, and focuses on oxidative 
stress, a natural byproduct of 
metabolism, 
and 
its 
potential 
ability to increase lifespan. The lab 
uses genetically identical worms to 
study aging.
Postdoctoral 
fellow 
Daphne 
Bazopoulou, a key contributor to 
the ongoing project, explained 
what oxidative stress is and why 
the group chose to study it in 
worms. 
“These are oxidants that every 
organism produces, and these are 
byproducts of metabolism, and 
these have been linked to oxidative 
damage which contributes to 
aging,” Bazopoulou said. “Worms 
produce those oxidants at very high 
levels during development and they 
do that naturally … so this was a 
little bit weird because we knew 
from studies before that excessive 
oxidants might do harm, however, 
these juvenile worms were able to 
recover by themselves.”

Starting 
this 
April, 
undergraduate students can 
apply to the Ford School of 
Public Policy for acceptance 
into the new public policy minor 
for Fall 2020. The minor will be 
open to students from LSA, the 
College of Engineering, Ross 
School of Business, School 
of Information and School of 
Public Health.
Sharon 
Maccini, 
faculty 
director of the undergraduate 
program at the Public Policy 
School, said the impetus for 
the minor came from hearing 
students express interest in 
studying public policy without 
necessarily majoring in it.
“The idea was to attract 
students who are primarily 
committed 
to 
another 
discipline and to supplement 
their education with public 

policy studies,” Maccini said. 
“We offer essentially a toolkit, 
various types of skills and 
ideas that can be useful for 
pursuing effective change and 
leadership in essentially any 
field.” 
According 
to 
the 
press 
release, 
sophomores 
and 
juniors 
are 
able 
to 
apply 
from April 1 to May 15. The 
application consists of an online 
form, resume, transcript and 
two short essays. Students will 
hear their results by mid-June, 
and 25 students are expected 
to be offered admission into 
the minor. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Sarah 
Abdelbaki intends to major in 
economics and international 
studies. However, she said 
she is also interested in public 
policy. After learning about the 
new minor program, Abdelbaki 
said she was excited about the 
opportunity.

The Ann Arbor City Council 
met for the first time in 2020 
on Monday night to discuss a 
federal lawsuit filed over anti-
Israel protests at Beth Israel 
Congregation and increasing 
regulations 
for 
short-term 
rental properties.
Anti-Israel protester Henry 
Herskovitz spoke during public 
comment about the political 
demonstrations. 
Herskovitz, 
who leads the groups Deir 
Yassin 
Remembered 
and 
Jewish Witnesses for Peace 
and Friends, is listed as a 
defendant on a recent lawsuit 
filed by a member of Beth Israel 
Congregation. 
The 
lawsuit 
claims the protest group led by 
Herskovitz use hateful, anti-
Semitic speech.
The lawsuit also lists the 
city as a defendant for letting 
the protests continue over the 

past 16 years. 
Herskovitz 
explained 
why 
his 
group 
chose 
to 
protest in front of Beth Israel 
Congregation, 
citing 
it 
as 
both a house of worship and a 
political institution.
“We 
noted 
that 
Beth 
Israel flies a foreign flag 
in its sanctuary, that the 
congregation recites a prayer 
for the state of Israel every 
week, that many congregants 
wave Israeli flags as they drive 
into the parking lot and that 
some even sport Jewish-Israeli 
license 
plates,” 
Herskovitz 
said.
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, 
D-Ward 
3, 
responded 
to 
Herskovitz’s 
comments, calling him racist 
and anti-Semitic. Ackerman 
said he grew up as a member 
of Beth Israel Congregation 
and 
later 
said 
Ackerman’s 
comments were of his own 

opinion.
“Anti-Semitism in modern 
America looks exactly like Mr. 
Herskovitz,” Ackerman said. 
“Anti-Semitism 
in 
modern 
America looks like embedding 
distrust in your neighbors. I’m 
accusing Mr. Herskovitz of 
being an anti-Semite and using 
his 
platform 
of 
protesting 
a house of worship for the 
last 16 years as racist and 
anti-Semitic, and I think it’s 
important to call out.”
Later 
in 
the 
meeting, 
councilmembers 
discussed 
implementing a revised solid 
waste management plan. The 
outlined 
plan 
advised 
the 
City on how to keep its solid 
waste, recycling and compost/
organics 
management 
programs 
financially 
responsible and sustainable. 
Councilmember Jack Eaton, 
D-Ward 4, said he would like to 
refer the plan back to city staff 
and table the resolution.
“Rather than being a 
planning 
document, 
it’s 
really just a list of to-do 
items 
that 
we 
can 
do 
without a plan,” Eaton said. 
“This really falls short in a 
variety of ways.”
Councilmember 
Jeff 
Hayner, D-Ward 1, agreed 
with 
Eaton, 
saying 
the 
revised plan did not support 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
goals 
for 
combating climate change.
“Zero 
waste 
is 
you 
don’t generate any waste, 
or you generate as little 
waste as possible and what 
waste has to be generated 
is then dealt with in an 
ecologically 
appropriate 
manner,” Hayner said. “I 
really want the best deal 
for the community and 
the environment, with our 
climate action goals, so I 
will happily support tabling 
this.”
Concilmember 
Jane 
Lumm, I-Ward 2, disagreed 
with Eaton and Hayner 
and said the plan was 

comprehensive 
and 
logical, 
adding that it would generate 
savings for taxpayers.
“In all my years I can say, 
unequivocally, this is the most 
thorough, 
well-researched, 
documented, 
data-driven 
report I have ever seen the city 
produce,” Lumm said. “It is 
exceptional.”
The council voted in favor of 
tabling the resolution, moving 
on to discuss a resolution 
that would implement more 
restrictions 
on 
short-term 
rental properties in Ann Arbor. 
Councilmember 
Kathy 
Griswold, D-Ward 2, said she 
thought the city had waited too 
long to address the regulation 
of short-term rentals.
“We need to balance the 
needs of the neighborhoods, but 
I still think that there needs to 
be some type of grandfathering 
in of the existing short-term 
rentals,” Griswold said.
While Councilmember Ali 
Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, said he 
hopes City Council can find 
common ground on this issue 
so companies such as Airbnb 
can 
still 
operate 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, he said having short-
term rentals often negatively 
impacts the community.
“I have an issue when you 
set up a business in an area 
that’s not zoned for business,” 
Ramlawi 
said. 
“We 
can 
extrapolate for quite some time 
what that means, but these 
single-family 
zoning 
areas 
of our community were not 
intended for this type of new 
phenomenon.”
Councilmember 
Julie 
Grand, D-Ward 3, said she 
saw both sides of the issue but 
supports moving forward with 
regulating short-term rentals. 
“I 
do 
think 
there 
are 
providers of short-term rentals 
that 
provide 
services 
that 
are of value to people who 
are visiting our community,” 
Grand said.

AND SO IT BEGINS
puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

Jan. 7, 1999: President Bill Clinton’s impeachment 
trial set to open before jurors in United States Senate

“A time it was, and what a 
time. And this is a time for 
the president.” 
Political science Prof. Mel 
Laracey used the famous 
Charles Dickens quote to 
start his first class of second 
semester in political science 
415: The American Chief 
Executive.
Today is a day that will go 
down in the history books 
as the second impeachment 
trial for an elected president 
is 
scheduled 
to 
begin. 
Although the trial dominates 

headlines, 
most 
political 
science classes - even those 
dealing directly with the 
presidency 
and 
American 
government - will not change 
dramatically, professors said. 
Laracey 
warned 
his 
students yesterday to keep 
from getting too wrapped up 
in the trial.
“It is necessary to keep 
some perspective. This will 
pass and become part of 
history,” Laracey said. “This 
looks 
like 
an 
important 
occasion, but I don’t think 

that it will make any huge 
impact on the functioning 
of the office or its integrity. 
Regardless, we will have a 
new president in two years.”
But students in the class are 
looking to the impeachment 
trial to have a significant 
impact on the course.
“I think that the trial will 
make the class a lot more 
interesting and more relevant 
to everyday life,” LSA senior 
Josh Meyers said.
Political science professors 
at other universities plan to 

give the trial a little more 
weight in their curriculum.
“I will make references to 
it, of course. I have students 
analyze newspaper articles, 
so we will be trying to link the 
ongoing events to the themes 
of the class,” said James 
Eisenstien, a political science 
professor 
at 
Pennsylvania 
State University. “We will 
use 
the 
trial 
events 
to 
teach theories. I will draw 
examples from impeachment 
to bring home points about 
American politics.”

David Rohde, a political 
science professor at Michigan 
State University, said he will 
refocus his class only by 
teaching that impeachment 
has become a reality.
“If I were teaching two 
years ago, impeachment was 
only a theory. Now it is actual 
and will have to occupy more 
time,” Rohde said.
The historical significance 
of the trial also is destined 
to affect American history 
classes 
as 
well, 
some 
professors said.

“The 
debates 
over 
impeachment 
have 
given 
students 
a 
feeling 
of 
immediacy and invigorated 
class 
discussions,” 
said 
history Prof. Rebecca Scott, 
who chairs the University’s 
department. “It really gives 
legitimacy 
to 
discussions 
about 
the 
separation 
of 
powers, along with checks 
and balances. The faculty 
will link the events of the 
trial to the material of the 
course.”

The Michigan Daily (ISSN 0745-967) is published Monday through Friday during 
the fall and winter terms by students at the University OF Michigan. One copy is 
available free of charge to all readers. Additional copies may be picked up at the 
Daily’s office for $2. Subscriptions for September-April are $250 and year long 
subscriptions are $275. University affiliates are subject to a reduced subscription 
rate. On-campus subscriptions for fall term are $35. Subscriptions must be prepaid.

“The 
First 
Amendment 
… is subject to appropriate 
limitations on its continued 
and repeated usage.”
Defendants 
named 
in 
the lawsuit include Henry 
Herskovitz, 
Gloria 
Harb, 
Tom Saffold, Rudy List and 
Chris 
Mark. 
The 
lawsuit 
also lists the groups Deir 
Yassin 
Remembered 
and 
Jewish Witnesses for Peace 
and Friends — both led by 
Herskovitz, a former member 
of the congregation — as 
defendants. 
The Southern Poverty Law 
Center placed Deir Yassin 
Remembered on a list of 
hate groups in 2017 due to 
their support of Holocaust 
deniers 
Michael 
Hoffman, 
Eric Hunt, Germar Rudolf 
and the late Bradley Smith. 
Board members have also 
questioned 
historically 
accurate 
facts 
about 
the 
Holocaust.
In an August interview 
with The Daily, Herskovitz 
criticized the SPLC and said 
he believes hate is a name-
calling mechanism.
“They’re 
an 
amazing 
business because all they 
do is sell fear,” Herskovitz 
said. “As it turns out we were 
placed on the hate group due 
to one person, and that was 
with my membership to Deir 
Yassin Remembered, which 
isn’t the vigil group. But 
when you’re slimy people you 
don’t care about the details or 
the facts.” 
Deir Yassin Remembered 
previously campaigned for 
the release of Ernst Zundel, 
a German neo-Nazi who was 
imprisoned for inciting race 
hatred. In 2006, Herskovitz 
and Daniel McGowan, the 
former 
executive 
director 
of Deir Yassin Remembered, 
visited Zundel in Mannheim 
Prison 
in 
Germany. 
Herskovitz told The Daily 
that he wished to meet with 
Zundel in order to “confront 
the issue.”
“Every time I hear that 
someone is an anti-Semite, I 
want to go meet that person,” 
Herskovitz said. “If you put 
‘Holocaust deniers’ in quotes, 
I’ve 
met 
more 
Holocaust 
deniers than you can name 
because I want to go to 
people. I want to see what 
they’re really about … I am 
concerned about Jews, and 
I am very concerned about 
how their history is going to 
be finally written.”

However, 
Herskovitz 
rejects the claim Witnesses 
for Peace and any of its 
members are anti-Semitic. 
Member 
Blaine 
Coleman 
said the protest is generally 
against the military aid of 
Israel. 
“You’ve 
got 
a 
racist, 
violent government in Israel 
that has just shot down 
dozens of unarmed human 
rights protesters in Gaza,” 
Herskovitz said. “Israel is 
about 
killing 
Palestinians 
and taking their land. I don’t 
think it’s about religion.”
In addition to Herskovitz 
and the other protesters, 
the 
lawsuit 
lists 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor, 
City 
Attorney Stephen Postema, 
Senior 
Assistant 
City 
Attorney 
Kristen 
Larcom 
and 
Community 
Services 
Administrator 
Derek 
Delacourt 
as 
defendants, 
claiming the city has not 
required the group to obtain 
a permit to continue their 
demonstrations. 
The 
litigation 
also 
alleges 
that 
by 
allowing 
the 
protests 
to 
continue 
without 
restrictions, 
the 
city 
infringes 
upon 
the 
congregation 
member’s 
First Amendment rights, as 
they are unable to practice 
their 
freedom 
of 
religion 
without being “harassed” by 
demonstrators.
Taylor told The Daily he 
has not yet read the complaint 
or received communications 
regarding the lawsuit from 
city lawyers. He said the city 
has done everything possible 
to 
ensure 
constitutional 
rights are protected.
“The 
city 
honors 
the 
constitutional 
rights 
of 
everyone, no matter what your 
political views,” Taylor said. 
“In my opinion, the protests 
in front of the synagogue 
are 
entirely 
inappropriate 
and disgraceful. The city 
respects the constitutional 
rights 
of 
the 
people 
to 
express themselves and we 
act accordingly.”
The protests are not only 
harmful and irrational, Taylor 
said, but are inconsistent 
with Ann Arbor’s community 
values.
Robert Blumenthal, Beth 
Israel 
Congregation 
board 
president, gave The Daily a 
statement on behalf of the 
synagogue.
“While 
Beth 
Israel 
Congregation is in no way 
associated with this lawsuit, 
the activity outside of our 
house of worship every week 
continues to be offensive and 

reprehensible, and includes 
anti-Semitic 
hate 
speech,” 
the statement reads.
Rabbi Nadav Caine, from 
the Beth Israel Synagogue, 
told 
The 
Daily 
he 
and 
members of the congregation 
are often distressed about 
the protest. Caine said it is 
disconcerting that a city such 
as Ann Arbor would allow 
these 
demonstrations 
to 
continue for so long.
However, Caine said Beth 
Israel Congregation has a 
very 
positive 
relationship 
with Taylor, the Ann Arbor 
City Council and the city 
attorney. However, he still 
questions if more can be done 
to limit the volume of the 
protests, which he called hate 
speech.
“I 
value 
the 
First 
Amendment. 
I 
value 
my 
relationships with the City, 
but I sometimes wonder if 
this were happening to an 
African 
American 
church 
or to the mosque, whether it 
wouldn’t be more of a topic 
of conversation,” Caine said. 
“When it comes to the City 
Council and local ordinances, 
that’s really what it comes 
down to.”
Caine 
also 
said 
the 
synagogue has chosen to not 
participate in the lawsuit but 
could not comment as to why. 
Congregation members at 
Beth Israel often try to ignore 
the 
protesters 
and 
signs, 
Blumenthal said, though the 
members often find them 
very upsetting. He said many 
members of the congregation 
feel the city could do more, 
but they understand there are 
some limitations.
Blumenthal said said the 
city has responded to the 
protesters when contacted 
by Beth Israel Congregation 
in the past. Previously, the 
protesters had blocked the 
driveway into the synagogue, 
Blumenthal explained, which 
restricted 
congregation 
members from entering the 
parking lot.
Blumenthal said the police 
came 
after 
the 
city 
was 
notified and drew lines to 
prevent the protesters from 
surrounding the parking lot. 
“We 
(Beth 
Israel 
Congregation) 
are 
fairly 
resilient as a group, we’ve 
had to be over history,” 
Blumenthal said. “Some of us 
have young children there, 
and (the protest) has been 
going on 16 years … it’s been 
every week with sometimes 
very hateful signs.”

LAWSUIT
From Page 1A

Ursula 
Jakob, 
the 
lab’s 
primary investigator, said the 
researchers 
observed 
that 
oxidative 
stress 
in 
juvenile 
worms 
resulted 
in 
longer 
lifespans, leading them to begin 
their experiments. 
“The worms that have the 
highest levels of reactive oxygen 
species during this early stage 
were the ones that were most 
stress-resistant and the longest 
lived of the whole population,” 
Jakob said. “That was something 
that was very intriguing because 
it suggested that you can have 
these events very early in life in 
an organism that triggers this 
production of reactive oxygen 
species, and that will then 
extend the lifespan of that sub-
population of worms.”
Bazopoulou said they induced 
specific amounts of oxidative 
stress in these worm populations 
during early-life stages to test if 
it increased lifespan. 
“The main message is that 
oxidants in early life might 
predispose 
the 
organisms 
to 
withstanding 
stress,” 
Bazopoulou said. “They were 
becoming preconditioned; they 
were experiencing some early-

life stress which made them 
battle stress that they were 
encountering later in life.”
Bazopoulou 
said 
the 
lab 
planned 
to 
investigate 
this 
specific mechanism throughout 
an organism’s lifespan and how 
it may affect predisposition to 
age-associated diseases. 
“We are also interested now 
in seeing whether those early-
life oxidants can predispose 
organisms to better battle age-
related 
pathologies 
such 
as 
neurodegenerative 
disorders 
like dementia and Alzheimer’s,” 
Bazopoulou said.
LSA freshman Liam Thew 
Forrester, 
an 
undergraduate 
research 
assistant 
in 
a 
different lab at the molecular 
and 
behavioral 
neuroscience 
institution, 
studies 
stress-
induced mood disorders. He 
shared his excitement at the 
findings of this stress-related 
research. 
“I was really surprised by it, 
it’s really interesting to think 
that the stress can actually be 
beneficial if it’s early on because 
that could vastly change how we 
do things, not just for longevity, 
it could help with the stress-
induced 
disorders 
as 
well,” 
Forrester said. 
Jakob said she hopes to 
eventually develop interventions 

to help people combat the health 
and lifestyle struggles of aging. 
“This suggests that at a 
very early stage in life you can 
positively affect lifespan by, in 
this case, changing the levels of 
reactive oxygen species,” Jakob 
said. “If we can find out what 
are the mechanisms that are 
set in motion at a juvenile stage 
but ultimately are responsible 
later in life for higher stress 
resistance and longer life, maybe 
we can find an intervention that 
targets directly those processes 
so that we actually still have 
a chance to benefit from this 
information.”
Jakob explained the goal 
of this research is to have a 
real impact on human health 
and physiology. Her lab plans 
to continue investigating the 
unknown factors that affect 
aging. 
“If we understand all the 
long-term effects that have 
been set into motion in early 
development, maybe we can 
mimic those long-term effects by 
pharmacological interventions 
or other interventions,” Jakob 
said. “What are ultimately the 
changes in these organisms 
when it comes to aging and 
death that allows them to live 
longer?”

GAME
From Page 1A

“This is the fruit of great 
interdisciplinary teamwork 
and also really working with 
the parents and the kids that 
are testing the game, they 
are also a part of it.”
Graf said he was grateful to 
be able to engage in this type 
of applied research. 
“Developing 
technology 
explicitly to promote social 
change and the removal of 
social and physical barriers 
is just something that feels 
very fulfilling to make steps 
towards,” Graf said. “I’m just 
privileged that the University 
gives me the freedom to 
decide in which direction I 
want to develop technology. 
The freedom I have as a 
researcher and academic is to 
go for the truly life-fulfilling 
work.”
Hun-Seok 
Kim, 
an 
Engineering 
assistant 
professor, 
also 
found 
the 
project’s goal to be important. 
“It is a unique project 
for our research team as it 
directly connects technology 
development 
and 
research 
to 
an 
application 
with 
immediate social impacts,” 
Kim said. “Unlike other more 
theoretical 
research, 
this 
project allows us to directly 
engage with people outside of 
academia.”
Graf said participants have 
had positive responses to 
the project. He said players 
appreciated 
its 
inclusivity 
for both those with mobility 
disabilities and those without.
“We had a couple of kids 
ages 7 to 16 years test the 
system, and they found the 
game competitive, regardless of 
whether they use wheelchairs 
or not,” Graf said. “My favorite 
quote from our studies that 
sums beautifully the idea of 
what inclusive play can be is 
a participant who played the 
game using a wheelchair said 

it’s basically adapted for everyone, 
even people with no physical 
disabilities.” 
Information 
senior 
Emma 
Shpiz, who has been a research 
assistant on the project since the 
winter 2017 semester, noted her 
previous experience working with 
children with disabilities.
“I have a lot of background 
in working with kids, especially 
throughout high school,” Shpiz 
said. “I was really involved in 
clubs where we were using sports 
to build relationships and have a 
combination of fun and learning 
for different kids with different 
disabilities. Also, having a couple 
different family members who 
have various disabilities (made) 
this something that was really 
important to me.”
Shpiz said she was drawn to 
iGYM because of how unique the 
project was.
“I was honestly shocked that 
nothing like this had been done 
before.” Shpiz said “It’s kind 
of very different in the field. 
Obviously, there’s a lot of work 
towards 
different 
games 
for 
people with different disabilities, 
but just finding this really niche 
space where it keeps it competitive 
for both sides was really exciting 
for me.”
Shpiz 
realized 
how 
iGYM 
could improve inclusivity for 
people with disabilities when she 
interviewed a 5-year-old girl with 
a disability and her mother, who 
found the game very effective for 
her daughter.
“We 
were 
sitting 
in 
the 
interview 
asking 
her 
pretty 
generic questions after she had 

played the game, and all of a 
sudden her mom, she starts crying 
and was like, ‘This is so incredible, 
I’m so glad you guys are doing 
this, I’m dying for this game 
to be placed in my daughter’s 
school,’” Shpiz said. “For this to be 
something that I think could have 
a really big impact is my biggest 
takeaway.”
Kim said iGYM has merited 
positive reactions from children, 
parents and researchers alike, 
who found the project very 
rewarding.
“We had a case where these 
two brothers had never played 
a physical game before because 
their abilities are quite different,” 
Kim said. “We saw some teary 
eyes from the parents, and it was 
a very rewarding moment to see 
them and also researchers having 
a lot of fun.”
Graf said he and his team 
foresee iGYM entering the market 
in the future and are currently 
working on making the system 
more robust before consulting 
with an industry partner. The 
Houston YMCA and spaces in 
New York have made inquiries 
about having the system installed.
Kim said the future of iGYM 
holds many different possibilities 
due to the versatility of augmented 
reality systems.
“Possibilities 
are 
virtually 
limitless,” Kim said. “AR systems 
can 
overcome 
the 
limitation 
of 
physical 
surroundings 
by 
augmenting 
the 
reality. 
For 
example, iGYM augments each 
player’s ability to allow inclusive 
play among people with different 
physical abilities.”

“As someone that’s interested 
in policy, this would add that 
to what I’m already learning 
in school,” Abdelbaki said. “It 
would allow me to keep econ 
and international studies as my 
priorities.”
To complete the 16-credit 
minor, students will enroll 
in PubPol 201, a four-credit 
survey course of current policy 
issues, as well as PubPol 320, 
a four-credit class on the 
relationship between politics 
and public policy that all Ford 
School majors are required to 
take. Students who have not 
taken Econ 101 will take PubPol 
310, a four-credit class aimed 
at using economics to analyze 
policy, while those who have 
taken Econ 101 can substitute 
an elective instead. To complete 

the minor, students must also 
take four credits of electives.
Maccini said the minor is 
geared towards students like 
Abdelbaki, who hope to add 
public policy skills to their 
degrees. 
“The idea is to provide this 
supplementary set of tools that 
really focus in on policy change, 
social 
change, 
and 
more 
generally leadership, analytical 
skills, critical thinking skills, 
drawing primarily from an 
interdisciplinary social science 
perspective,” Maccini said. 
In a December email to 
students and faculty, Dean 
Michael Barr clarified that 
certain 
benefits 
would 
be 
reserved 
for 
Public 
Policy 
majors.
“Please note that while we 
hope to actively engage our 
new BA minor cohort into the 
Ford School community, some 
resources, such as our dedicated 
career counselor, will remain 

available only to students who 
are majoring in public policy,” 
Barr wrote.
Public Policy senior Nicholas 
Martire serves as the president 
of the Public Policy School’s 
undergraduate student council. 
He noted the minor provides a 
good sampling of the classes 
and skills public policy majors 
learn.
“For me, Ford has been an 
opportunity to look at real-
world issues and figure out 
policy issues to solve them,” 
Martire 
said. 
“The 
minor 
sounds like it will offer a similar 
opportunity.”
Martire said he is looking 
forward to seeing more students 
get involved with public policy.
“It 
seems 
like 
a 
great 
opportunity for more students 
to have a chance to receive a 
Ford education,” Martire said. 
“I think the more people that 
have the opportunity to have 
some sort of public policy

To 
conclude 
his 
talk, 
Wallace said he had a dream 
where he was in a sinking 
boat. 
In 
the 
dream, 
he 
decided to save the children 
drowning at the bottom of 
the ship instead of himself. 
He explained this dream was 
a metaphor for him deciding 
to risk his career in order 
to share his opinion about 
journalistic integrity. 
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
George 
Feldman 
said 
he 
found 
the 
sinking 
ship 
metaphor the most moving 
part of Wallace’s talk. 
“It was a metaphor for 
a situation we all feel,” 
Feldman said. “What would 

you do (in a situation) when 
it’s important … What do you 
do when you risk your job, 
or even when you risk your 
promotion, or you risk your 
friends cutting you off when 
you take an unpopular or 
difficult choice?”
After the book reading, 
Wallace held a question-
and-answer 
session. 
Audience members praised 
his skills as a storyteller 
and debated the need for 
facts 
versus 
storytelling. 
Some said people are only 
interested 
in 
compelling 
stories and others said facts 
are of interest when they are 
from trusted sources. 
When asked to define the 
role of journalists, Wallace 
said the profession should 
encourage 
unconventional 
journalistic writing to keep 

up 
with 
current 
media 
trends. According to Wallace, 
traditional 
journalism 
styles, 
which 
prioritize 
key 
facts 
over 
narrative 
storytelling, 
were 
only 
relevant when news traveled 
slower, such as when people 
had to ride horses to deliver 
newspapers.
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Anna 
Brunner 
said 
she 
found Wallace’s ideas of 
reinventing 
the 
role 
of 
journalism was inspiring. 
“My 
favorite 
part 
was 
how he talked about the 
fundamental change that is 
needed in journalism today,” 
Brunner said. “Providing the 
different ways with being in 
community and reimagining 
a profession in a way that is 
centering justice and equity 
was really inspiring.”

“I’m just not sure when I 
weigh the pros and cons that 
the value to those individuals 
overrides the value of a family 
being able to live in a house or 
someone not living next to a 
commercial enterprise.”
Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 
Christopher Taylor said he 
supported 
the 
resolution, 
noting 
neighborhoods 
with 
homes used for short-term 
rentals often lose their sense 
of community.
“There’s incomplete data as 
to safety, there are incomplete 
data as to the effect on pricing, 
but I think that the absence of 
community is unanswerable 

and for me is of particular 
importance.”
The council voted to approve 
the resolution. Additionally, 
councilmembers 
voted 
to 
add 
a 
full-time 
lieutenant 
position to the Ann Arbor 
Police Department to audit 
and review reports and video 
footage. They also approved 
annexing 
parcels 
of 
Ann 
Arbor Township and Pittsfield 
Township.
Local 
environmental 
toxicologist 
Mozhgan 
Savabieasfahani spoke during 
public 
comment. 
At 
the 
last City Council meeting, 
Savabieasfahani 
announced 
her candidacy for the Ward 4 
seat in 2020, where she will 
be running against Eaton and 
Ann Arbor resident Jen Eyer, 

a former journalist for MLive 
and the Ann Arbor News. Last 
week, Savabieasfahani said her 
platform would be focused on 
advocating for the immediate 
cleanup 
of 
the 
Gelman 
Dioxane 
plume 
and 
PFAS 
contamination in Ann Arbor.
Savabieasfahani said she did 
not support putting the site of 
the Gelman Dioxane plume on 
the Environmental Protection 
Agency’s list as a Superfund 
site.
“It takes up to 30 years for 
sites that are already on the 
EPA list to be cleaned up,” 
Savabieasfahani 
said. 
“If 
we want to go that route it’s 
basically just being forced to 
wait for a really long time if it 
comes to be clean.”

Two years after #MeToo, we need progress

Far removed from Mandela, the ANC’s legacy decays

I

n October 2017, #MeToo 
swept the web by storm. 
Victims 
of 
sexual 
misconduct 
congregated 
via 
Twitter 
to 
inform 
the general public of the 
pervasiveness 
of 
sexual 
violence, despite its lack of 
coverage in public discussion. 
Although 
an 
outstanding 
number of women experience 
sexual harassment, a large 
majority 
of 
occurrences 
are 
neither 
reported 
nor 
even acknowledged. One of 
the key insights from the 
#MeToo movement was the 
great urgency to implement 
more preventative education 
regarding sexual misconduct, 
an issue that our nation has 
yet to take action on.
As 
a 
young 
girl 
going 
through the public education 
system in Indiana, I found 
that 
health 
class 
was 
the 
laughingstock 
of 
the 
school 
curriculum. 
With 
mundane 
and 
repetitive 
assignments 
following 
day 
after day, we never needed 
to pay attention in class. The 
curriculum 
was 
painfully 
reserved; our lessons were 
confined to learning about 
the human body, abstinence 
and 
sexually 
transmitted 
diseases. Looking back today, 
the conservative education 
I was given is irritating. 
The class had potential to 
teach young, impressionable 
teenagers something greater 
about consent and respect in 
relationships. Yet, in fear of 
being too vulgar or promoting 
sexual activity, the school 
neglected 
this 
immensely 
important 
component 
of 
health. Comprehensive sex ed 
has been proven to work study 
after study and still many 
schools, including mine, have 
never implemented an all-
inclusive sex education. 
While it can be extremely 
empowering 
to 
sexual 
violence 
survivors, 
calling 
out 
perpetrators 
and 
shaming 
their 
behavior 

is simply not enough for 
the 
greater 
meaning 
of 
this 
movement. 
In 
order 
to accomplish what’s most 
serious — preventing sexual 
assault from transpiring in 
the first place — we must 
take preemptive measures. 
Because of the great amount 
of time children spend in 
schools, it is only rational 
these preemptive measures 
be implemented into school 
curriculums. 
Preventative 
education has been proven 
to 
work; 
schools 
already 
have alcohol abuse and drug 
prevention 
programs 
in 
effect, with results showing 
a reduction in the number of 
occurrences of sexual assault. 
If the concepts of consent, 
respect 
for 
others 
and 
sensitivity to their feelings 
were taught more seriously 
in public schools, serious 
advancements could be made 
in the realm of sexual assault 
prevention. 

One 
argument 
against 
including consent in public 
school 
curriculum 
is 
that 
it will only condone sexual 
activity and lead to a rise in 
the rates of pregnancy and 
sexually transmitted diseases. 
However, this has been proven 
to be false. With the age of the 
internet, teenagers are bound 
to learn about sex, whether it 
is taught in schools or not. The 
means from which teenagers 
learn about sex are limitless; 
movies, 
pornography 
and 
music all teach the youth 
about sex, and often portray 

these sexual relationships in 
disrespectful or problematic 
ways. 
Withholding 

information about safe sex and 
consent only harms school-
aged children; preventative 
education could easily combat 
these demeaning portrayals of 
sex.
Another 
argument 
for 
preventative 
education 
regarding sexual assault is the 
fact that gender harassment 
often 
occurs 
as 
early 
as 
kindergarten. Educating on 
sexual assault in the very 
place 
where 
it 
originates 
would be especially effective. 
The 
#MeToo 
movement 
acknowledged 
sexual 
and 
gender-based 
harassment 
in the workplace, but failed 
to 
address 
this 
behavior 
among grade-school children. 
Power dynamics and gender 
socialization 
are 
learned 
at an extremely young age, 
and tackling the subsequent 
problems they spawn in the 
very place they are created 
would most certainly be the 
best way to solve them. If 
young boys were taught their 
seemingly harmless actions 
(like pestering a girl) had 
greater implications, it’d be 
easier for them to understand 
the consequences of their 
actions as they grow older. 
It would be a waste of an 
opportunity 
if 
the 
power 
behind the #MeToo movement 
didn’t change the way our 
school 
systems 
approach 
sexual assault. One change 
that would certainly decrease 
the ubiquity of this problem 
would 
be 
implementing 
preventive 
education 
in 
health 
classes 
of 
public 
schools. From a young age 
children should be taught that 
no means no, and we should 
ingrain in their minds that 
disrespectful 
actions 
have 
serious consequences before 
it is too late.

I

n 
1994, 
South 
African 
apartheid ended and the 
nation’s Black community 
was finally granted suffrage. With 
that momentous change, Nelson 
Mandela and the long-outlawed 
African National Congress swept 
into power, winning 252 of the 
400 seats in the nation’s national 
assembly. Beginning here, the 
ANC 
established 
a 
political 
dynasty which has lasted ever 
since — in every election, the ANC 
has maintained their majority 
and won at least 230 seats. As 
the de facto party of liberation, 
the ANC has maintained a 
godlike 
reputation 
within 
the majority-Black nation for 
decades. However, 25 years after 
the ANC’s political ascension, 
their dominance is endangered. 
Largely thanks to self-inflicted 
problems (namely corruption), a 
series of political failures and an 
inability to carry on Mandela’s 
legacy, the ANC has slowly begun 
to lose its grip on power, and risks 
losing the adulation it first earned 
as the party of Black liberation. 
The ANC’s values were first 
officially codified in the Freedom 
Charter, a document written 
in 1955, with the party’s most 
important priority being that 
“The 
People 
Shall 
Govern.” 
When the party gained legitimate 
political power under Mandela, 
it styled itself as a center-left 
social democratic party with a 
focus on African Nationalism, 
anti-imperialism 
and 
social 
consciousness. 
Unfortunately 
for South Africans, the party 
now appears to care about those 
values in name only. 
The ANC’s history of corruption 
stretches back to its original rise to 
power under Mandela, beginning 
in 1994. In order to ensure the 
nation’s transition to full-fledged 
democracy was peaceful, Mandela 
struck a deal with the leaders of 
the old apartheid regime: While 
Black South Africans would be 
given political power, white South 
Africans would maintain their 
control over the vast majority of 
the country’s economic resources. 
Beginning with Mandela himself, 
many ANC leaders and party 
elites — most of whom had 
little individual wealth — were 
essentially bribed by white elites 

to protect their business interests, 
creating a culture of corruption 
and 
exploitation 
which 
has 
persisted ever since.
In tandem with this, a second, 
even more prevalent form of 
corruption emerged within the 
hegemonic ANC: the usage of 
government contracts and funds 
for personal enrichment. Since 
the installment of the ANC-led 
government, 
well-connected 
party members have utilized 
government contracts as a way 
to make money, often funneling 
funds 
away 
from 
legitimate 
projects and into their own 
bank accounts. One of the most 
pertinent 
examples 
of 
this 
corruption was unearthed last 
year, when it was revealed that 
Jacob Zuma, former ANC leader 
and South African president, 
had helped the Gupta family, a 
wealthy business conglomerate, 
pilfer billions of dollars. For two 
decades, the Guptas maintained 
close relationships with political 
leaders within the ANC, a move 
which allowed them to win 
inflated industry contracts and 
enriched both the family and 
South Africa’s elites — all at the 
expense of the greater South 
African populace. 
Even more egregious than 
skimming off of government 
infrastructure 
contracts 
is 
ANC leaders’ long history of 
personally taking funds intended 
for poverty relief, even while 
South Africa maintains its status 
as the most unequal country in 
the world. Throughout South 
Africa, politicians taking money 
intended for welfare programs is 
ubiquitous; an easy way to judge 
an area’s level of corruption is 
to simply look at how run-down 
its 
affordable 
housing 
units 
are. Unfortunately, this broken 
system is at least partly due to 
how the government itself divides 
up responsibility: While the 
national government is primarily 
responsible for collecting taxes, 
provincial governments are in 
charge of most spending and 
receive relatively little oversight, 
allowing 
corruption 
of 
this 
variety to run rampant. 
Beyond numerous corruption 
scandals, 
the 
party’s 
ability 
to govern has also been called 

into question in recent years, 
especially as the legacy of 
apartheid fades and a new 
generation of South Africans 
reach voting age. Under Zuma, 
who served as President from 
2009 until 2018, unemployment 
rose 
dramatically, 
economic 
growth 
slowed 
and 
South 
Africa’s rankings in a bevy 
of 
social 
and 
governmental 
issues 
dropped 
precipitously. 
Furthermore, the ANC 
has 
continually struggled to come 
up with a plan for effectively 
bridging the massive wealth 
divide 
which 
still 
exists 
between Black and white South 
Africans (and attempts to do so 
have led to the popularization 
of a far-right party composed 
primarily of wealthy, white 
Afrikaners). 
Faced with these challenges, 
the party has been unable 
to create a cohesive identity 
and appeal to increasingly 
frustrated voters. After Zuma 
stepped down last year, the 
ANC’s current leader, Cyril 
Ramaphosa, 
was 
elected 
president. Although Ramaphosa 
is viewed as a breath of fresh 
air for the ANC, he is largely 
surrounded by corrupt figures 
who remain allied with Zuma, 
leading to the perception that 
the party lacks a clear direction. 
Even worse, Zuma is alleged to 
have political ammunition on 
many of these senior figures, 
which creates further gridlock 
and incentivizes them to do his 
bidding. Although Ramaphosa 
promised a number of economic 
reforms to try and revitalize the 
nation’s lagging economy, he 
has faced criticism from every 
direction: The left is frustrated 
his ideas are too favorable to 
business, while many businesses 
believe his reforms don’t go far 
enough. More important than 
any particular detail, Ramaphosa 
has frustrated everyone with 
his inability to get any of these 
reforms passed in the first place.

Soleimani strike destroys the region’s true destabilizing force
T

his 
week, 
much 
has 
been made of the recent 
decision 
by 
President 
Trump to authorize an airstrike 
that killed the leader of the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds 
Force branch, Qasem Soleimani. 
Social media has been flooded 
with content suggesting that this 
act will lead to a third world war, 
and the political world has come 
to a hotly contested debate about 
the implications of the killing. 
The event has certainly caused 
strong reactions, especially from 
high-ranking Iranian government 
officials, and is sure to dominate 
the headlines in coming weeks as 
tensions between the United States 
and Iran likely escalate.
Critics of the strike against 
Soleimani, including Speaker of 
the House Nancy Pelosi, advance at 
least one of two main points. First, 
that the President acted outside 
of his legal powers to facilitate 
this strike and should have sought 
the approval of Congress prior to 
it. They also assert that Trump’s 
decision will only serve to escalate 
violent conflict between the U.S. 
and Iran and was a serious mistake. 
Such criticisms, however, fall 
short of accurately assessing the 
legal and strategic realities of this 
military decision.
Since 
the 
development 
of 
military drones, this technology 
has 
played 
an 
increasingly 
significant 
role 
in 
military 
operations, particularly for the 
U.S. 
As 
various 
presidential 
administrations 
have 
engaged 
in drone operations, discourse 
surrounding the regulation of 
drone use through executive power 
has surfaced on multiple occasions, 
often 
following 
a 
significant 
American drone strike.
Yet no legislation has arisen to 
curtail a president’s right to use 
drones, or any other conventional 
means for American military 
operations, 
without 
consulting 
Congressional leaders. President 
Obama acknowledged in 2013 that 
despite his choice to alert Congress 
about his military decisions in 
Syria, he was not required to do so. 
His administration also attempted 
to expand the definition of the 
2001 Authorization for the Use of 
Military Force to apply the measure 
to U.S. actions in Afghanistan, Iraq 
and Syria.
Though the 1973 War Powers 
Resolution aimed to give Congress 
some power over military action 

by a president, the president still 
retains his constitutional status 
as Commander in Chief and has 
historically had the final say 
on similar and more extreme 
operations. Such instances include 
U.S. interventions in Kosovo and 
Libya, among others. Further, the 
Trump Administration did not 
send any armed forces into action 
through the decision to eliminate 
Qasem Soleimani, rendering the 
act as less, if at all, applicable in this 
case.

It is clear that outside of a 
desire to be kept informed of 
all strategic operations by the 
military, members of Congress 
and 
others 
who 
claim 
the 
decision 
was 
illegitimate 
or 
illegal due to Trump’s decision 
not to notify Congress cannot 
justify their claims. Precedent 
and legislation on such a topic 
prove that the decision can be 
legally justified. Yet the question 
remains, for some, whether the 
strike can be supported from a 
strategic standpoint. To answer 
this question, it is important to 
establish clarity about who Qasem 
Soleimani really was. 
Soleimani 
commanded 
the 
Iranian military’s Quds Force, 
which is responsible for carrying 
out the Islamic Republic’s agenda 
abroad. In his efforts to advance 
the malignant interests of Iran 
in the Middle East and around 
the 
world, 
Soleimani’s 
state-
sponsored terrorism led to the 
deaths of many civilians — the 
most recent example being an 
American defense contractor in 
Iraq in late December, according 
to the Department of Defense. 
The Department of Defense’s 
statement also noted the fact that 
Soleimani has been responsible 
for the deaths of many American 
and allied service members and 
had plans to cause more harm to 
Americans and U.S. interests. 

The 
operations 
Soleimani 
oversaw in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria, 
among other conflict zones, caused 
years of instability in the region and 
put U.S. troops and allies like Israel 
at risk. His career and entire adult 
life were dedicated to sowing this 
chaos. The Trump Administration 
justifiably viewed it as important 
to prevent this man, infamous for 
his cunning and unique abilities to 
promote Iranian hegemony, from 
causing more destruction. After 
declaring Soleimani’s Quds Force, 
and the IRGC as a whole, a terrorist 
organization (Soleimani himself 
had already been designated as a 
terrorist in 2011), the president put 
an end to his malignant activities.
General 
Soleimani’s 
record 
speaks for itself. While those who 
opposed the strike that killed the 
Quds Force leader alleged that the 
attack will only destabilize the 
region, they fail to consider that it 
was Soleimani who was the cause of 
great instability in the Middle East 
for the past few decades. Though 
the Iranian regime is sure to attempt 
retaliation, the risk of all-out war is 
likely minimal, given Iran’s lack 
of resources or capabilities to fight 
the U.S. directly without incurring 
insurmountable costs. 
The question for the U.S. is 
whether this bold act will prove to 
be justified in the long run. Given the 
general’s record of wreaking havoc 
for American interests around the 
world, and the recognition of his 
developed strategies for doing so, 
his assassination will likely turn out 
to be a force for good in a dangerous 
part of the globe. U.S.-Iranian 
tensions would have continued 
regardless of any action against 
the military leader, and the attack 
sends a message to Tehran that 
Washington is willing to respond 
strongly when American lives are 
threatened. 
President 
Trump, 
Secretary 
of State Mike Pompeo and other 
officials were wise to carry out the 
strike, which required no use of 
American troops and was intended 
to save countless lives. Though 
history will record the outcome of 
this ongoing struggle, it is obvious 
that to leave Soleimani alive 
would have certainly endangered 
the lives of American and allied 
troops, officials and civilians. Such 
foresight on the part of the U.S. 
should be greatly applauded.

Kiley Reid is interested in 
what makes us cringe.
“As a writer I’m really drawn 
toward hyper-realistic, almost 
awkward dialogue and inner 
monologue,” said Reid in a 
recent phone interview with 
The Michigan Daily. “And I’m 
very drawn to characters who 
find themselves in positions of 
power and don’t really know 
what to do with it.”
Accordingly, Reid situates 
her debut novel, “Such A Fun 
Age,” at the nexus of multiple 
tricky 
relationships 
in 
the 
politically pregnant year of 
2015. Enter Alix (“uh-leeks”) 
Chamberlain, a 30-something 
blogger and influencer who 
has spent years cultivating a 
personal brand loosely based 
on White feminism (“letter-
writing 
promotion-receiving 
getting-what-they-want 
women”) in her favorite place 
on Earth: New York. After 
landing a book deal and low-
key inserting herself in the 
Clinton campaign, Alix decides 
to give the big city a little 
break and relocates her news 
anchor husband and two young 
daughters 
to 
Philadelphia, 
where she spends her time 
procrastinating on said book 
and using social media to 
pretend she still lives in New 
York. 
“I thought it was important 
that Alix would have the type 
of job that not just anybody can 
have,” Reid explained. 
With all that work, Alix 
seeks out the perfect babysitter 
to 
take 
care 
of 
two-year-

old Briar Louise — her more 
loquacious, 
less 
look-alike 
daughter — and hires Emira 
Tucker, a 25-year-old Black 
woman, chiefly because she’s 
safely unfamiliar with Alix and 
her brand. But underneath her 
employable anonymity, Emira 
is struggling with the pressures 
of being a postgrad who doesn’t 
exactly know what she wants to 
do yet (“Emira didn’t love doing 
anything, but she didn’t terribly 
mind doing anything either”). 
She’s got a few months left on 
her parents’ health insurance, 
$79.16 in her bank account and 
a voice in her head that says 
“you don’t have a real job.” 
“Emira is so naturally anti-
careerist,” Reid added, “and I 
think that makes a lot of people 
… a little bit uncomfortable.”
One night the Chamberlains 
call Emira in a panic, offering 
to pay her double to distract 
Briar while they manage a 
last-minute emergency. Emira 
leaves a birthday party to take 
the Chamberlain’s toddler to a 
Whole Foods analog down the 
street known for “bone broths, 
truffle butters, smoothies … and 
several types of nuts in bulk,” 
where she is summarily accused 
of kidnapping the White child 
she’s been paid to watch. It’s an 
altercation charged with latent 
racism , and a self-aggrandizing 
bystander takes it upon himself 
to film it on his smartphone.
“There’s a lot of people 
wondering ‘How can I be the 
best ally and do the perfect 
thing in this terrible situation?’” 
Reid said. “And a there’s a lot 
less focus on ‘How do we make 
sure that these situations don’t 
happen to begin with?’”
The 
confrontation 
takes 
place at the outset of the novel, 

allowing its aftermath enough 
space to grow beyond the neat 
boundaries of “aftermath” and 
into the complex plot of its own. 
In this respect, Reid has written 
a book about the consequences 
of prioritizing allyism over 
structural change. And it’s 
masterfully 
awkward. 
Alix 

gets anxious about progressive 
identity and her self-worth 
morphs into an uncomfortable 
function of how close she can 
get to her babysitter, a building 
obsession that reads like a 
crush and results in some off-
putting 
but 
well-meaning 
wine nights. Emira is slightly 

spooked but needs the money 
and genuinely adores Briar, 
so she continues to make ends 
meet with the Chamberlains 
and enjoys herself when she 
can. Which includes getting 
involved with the video phone 
bystander, a 32-year-old White 
tech bro who has a track record 
of dating women of color, with 
the exception of his high school 
sweetheart. Who happens to be 
Alix Chamberlain. Yeah.
What ensues is a painful, 
passive 
series 
of 
personal 
flexes as Emira’s employer and 
boyfriend compete to “protect” 
her, what Alix refers to as “a 
losing game called ‘Which One 
of Us Is Actually More Racist?’” 
And it’s played desperately — 
in Alix’s case, to the extent of 
metrics: “… the fact she’d lain 
in bed the night before and 
been so pleased as she counted 
in her head how many African 
American 
guests 
would 
be 
present at her Thanksgiving 
table. This number had totaled 
to five.”
Throughout 
her 
novel 
and our phone conversation, 
though, Reid adamantly and 
repeatedly returns to a critical 
lurking variable in the sticky 
social equation: class.
“Talking about race without 
talking about class is a moot 
point,” Reid explained. “In this 
particular case, Blackness can 
look and be so many different 
things for so many different 
people. If I’m honest — You 
know what, I think that I was 
always drawn toward matters 
of class but I didn’t know 
that’s what they were,” she 
interjected. “I thought it was 
more etiquette in awkward 
moments and now I realize 
it’s 
more 
people 
dealing 
with their guilt and a lot of 
people finding themselves in 
positions of power, whether 
it’s their holding a phone or 
they have a babysitter, and how 
they respond to being in those 
positions.”
And a constant consideration 
of class, according to Reid, 
makes space for the sort of 
terribly nuanced people and 
problems that populate and 
pace “Such a Fun Age.” The 
novel 
itself 
opens 
with 
a 
quote from Rachel Sherman’s 
“Uneasy Street: The Anxieties 
of Affluence,” a series of 
interviews with upper-class 
New Yorkers, and a work which 
Reid cited as pivotal in her 
understanding and crafting of 
characters from varying class 
backgrounds.
“By the time I read (“Uneasy 
Street”) I knew the plot lines 
that I wanted to have for this 
novel, but I wanted to dive 
deeper into the issues of guilt 
and class solidarity and the 
very common way that people 
see their morality attached to 
their wealth, but not so much 
the systems that got them their 

wealth,” Reid explained.
“And I think that it helped 
in terms of my understanding 
of capital in America and how 
that affects peoples’ psyches, 
but it also helped me with 
character development for sure 
… my biggest takeaway from the 
book was that as soon as you 
are judging someone for being 
rich, you stop judging all of the 
systems that keep poor people 

poor.”
Here 
Reid 
paused 
— 
something she did frequently 
throughout our conversation. 
She speaks deliberately and 
emphatically, and often reflects 
on her words mere seconds 
after they enter air. 
“… And that gave me room to 
have really full characters that 
aren’t villains, that are really 
smart, 
sometimes 
that 
are 
really charming, but that also 
make really bad decisions.”
While 
responding 
to 
some of my questions (and, 
honestly, judgments) on Alix 
Chamberlain’s thornier takes 
(the Thanksgiving scene is 
unreal), Reid circled back to this 
class-derived expansiveness of 
self.
“I 
think 
it’s 
a 
human 
response that we don’t always 
arrive at what we think the 
proper response is right away, 
and sometimes it takes a little 
mental 
gymnastics,” 
Reid 
explained, slowing my critical 
roll. “And so I really wanted the 
reader to go with Alix and she’s 
arriving at those things, ‘cause 
she’s not perfect, and neither 
is Emira … but I think that all 
of the characters should have 
room to process these thoughts, 
even when they’re not the most 
sympathetic thoughts on their 
own.”
This is the type of writer 

Kiley Reid is. The amount of 
empathy and consideration she 
routinely expresses for all her 
characters, present tense, is a 
feat of feeling in and of itself. 
Later 
in 
our 
conversation, 
while reminding me that Alix is 
working under the pressures of 
late-stage capitalism (namely, 
the double burden of work-
for-profit and unpaid child 
rearing), Reid took a moment to 
wince in audible pain.
“Yeah, 
poor 
Alix,” 
Reid 
breathed. 
And 
then 
recomposed: “She’s doing the 
best she can, but if Alix is the 
perfect mom to nanny for it 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
Emira’s 
financial situation is going to 
change, or any Black woman’s.”
First and foremost, though, 
Kiley Reid is writing to compel 
an audience.
“As 
a 
human 
I’m 
very 
political and not shy about 
those things,” she explained, 
“but as a writer I like to make 
it all about my characters, and 
what they believe in.” 
Indeed, 
with 
all 
its 
awkwardness 
and 
tension 
considered, “Such a Fun Age” 
is immensely readable, almost 
unbelievably so. The pages fly, 
relaxed with frequent dialogue 
and references to social media 
and paced impeccably by the 
compelling triangles between 
Alix, Emira and the various 
relationships 
(transactional, 
romantic) 
that 
bind 
them. 
It’s been selected by Reese 
Witherspoon 
as 
her 
Book 
Club pick for January, and the 
film rights were picked up by 
Lena Waithe months before its 
initial publication. “Such a Fun 
Age” is the sweet-and-sour spot 
between heavy and light, a book 
about difficulty and nuance, 
specifically 
regarding 
class, 
money, and race. This makes it 
accessible to an unprecedented 
number of audiences.
“I love it when novels give 
me a lot more questions than 
answers,” 
Reid 
disclosed, 
“and so my first priority is 
always just to focus on the 
narrative and not be polemic 
or use any character to make 
an overarching point, but I 
would love to raise questions 
in people about these things … 
Okay, so why does Emira have 
to figure out what she wants to 
do at 25? Why did college work 
so much differently for Alix 
than it did for Emira? … I would 
love for readers to feel inspired 
to dive into why that lifestyle 
is threatening to them, or 
threatening to the characters.”
In that case, I amend my 
first 
sentence. 
Kiley 
Reid 
is interested in why we’re 
cringing. 
Kiley 
Reid 
will 
be 
at 
Literati Bookstore at 124 East 
Washington Street on Monday, 
January 13th at 7 p.m. to read 
from her novel, answer questions 
and sign books.

Writer Reid on why her 
debut will make us cringe

AUTHOR INTERVIEW
AUTHOR INTERVIEW

VERITY STURM
Daily Arts Writer

A fresh decade, a new year 
and a semester without tears all 
mean that there’s only one thing 
for me to do: develop imaginary 
and 
outrageous 
predictions 
for my life that will no doubt 
get my hopes up for the future. 
With the peak years of Disney 
Channel Original Movies in 
the 2000s, as well as whatever 
Greta Gerwig released during 
the last decade, there’s no better 
source material than the last 10 
years of films for my new series 
of delusions. 
As a junior, I’m expected to 
have an internship this summer. 
At the moment, I don’t have 
anything planned; however, I 
see myself finding an internship 
with Anne Hathaway as she 
tries to juggle a healthy work-
life balance. As her seemingly 
incapable intern, we will have 
conversations about life. She 
will feel like she can have these 
conversations with me because 
I’m not very intimidating and 
I’m a good babysitter for her 
daughter. The internship will 
teach me about the importance 
of life and set me up for senior 
year. Robert De Niro will be 

there to take my place and this 
is where 2015’s “The Intern” 
starts. 
After 
having 
met 
Anne 
Hathaway 
at 
her 
clothing 
start-up in New York, I’ll come 
back for my 
final year at 
Michigan. 
A 
pivotal 
year 
made 
even 
more 
important by 
the fact that, 
before leaving 
New York, my 
superpowers 
will 
finally 
manifest 
themselves. 
Senior 
year 
will be about 
trying 
to 
understand 
this 
new 
characteristic 
of 
my 
life 
while 
also 
trying 
to 
juggle 
the 
social 
consequences 
of my role as 
Ann Arbor’s newest (first?) 
vigilante. Whatever troubles 
finance courses give me won’t 
compare to figuring out how to 
quickly change into a spandex 

super suit without the help 
of movie magic. Whether my 
superpowers consist of webs 
coming out of my wrists or an 
affinity for Excel spreadsheets, 
I will have no complaints. They 
really can make 
my life, if not 
better, at least 
more exciting, 
despite 
the 
fact that they 
supposedly 
come 
with 
“great 
responsibility.” 
More 
realistically, 
or 
at 
least 
less 
based 
in 
fiction, I plan 
on 
cementing 
a 
variety 
of 
friendships 
that have the 
potential 
to 
either blossom 
into a fabulous 
whirlwind 
romance 
that 
I’ll 
remember 
for 
the 
rest 
of my life or 
employment after graduation. 
Either 
option 
is 
pretty 
fantastical at this point in 
my life. Like many a Disney 
Channel 
Original 
Movie 

protagonist, my odds of meeting 
a celebrity and having an actual 
conversation with them will be 
exponentially higher than the 
average person in the coming 
decade. The details here are 
hazy — will I meet them at a 
music camp, convince them my 
mom isn’t the camp chef and 
have them fall in love with my 
music? Will we become lifelong 
friends, have a heart-to-heart 
on a hill in Massachusetts only 
to have them marry my sibling 
a decade later? Or maybe we’ll 
sing karaoke together at a New 
Year’s 
party, 
coincidentally 
end up at the same school the 
following week and fall in love 
during the school play while 
trying to juggle the insane 
social ramifications of a jock 
dating a nerd. The only thing I 
can do now is guess, but one of 
these things is bound to happen 

to me at some point in the 
future. 
Finally, 
though many of 
these predictions 
have been rooted 
in 
specific 
examples, there 
is a larger movie 
theme that, until 
now, has been 
missing 
from 
my life that I 
fully 
expect 
to 
experience 
more of in this 
decade: love. It 
can happen in 
2020 or it can 
happen later in 
the decade, I’m 
not that picky. 
And it’s not really the love I 
crave from these situations, 
but the dramatic romances 

— where is my Nora Ephron-
choreographed meet-cute? My 
“Little 
Women” 
friend-turned 
scorned 
lover-
turned 
sister’s 
fiancé? I want the 
kind of intrigue 
that can take my 
20s 
from 
just 
another decade in 
my life to my 20s. 
I want that kind 
of 
personality 
that 
makes 
my 
grandkids 
say, 
“Damn, I wish I 
knew 
grandma 
when 
she 
was 
hot.”

I want the kind 
of intrigue that 
can take my 
20s from just 
another decade 
in my life to my 
20s.

The pages fly, 
relaxed with 
frequent dialogue 
and references to 
social media and 
paced impeccably 
by the compelling 
triangles between 
Alix, Emira 
and the various 
relationships 
(transactional, 
romantic) that 
bind them. 

Throughout 
her novel and 
our phone 
conversation, 
though, Reid 
adamantly and 
repeatedly returns 
to a critical 
lurking variable 
in the sicky social 
equation: class.

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS


Let’s get this out of the way: 
I write negative reviews about 
music because I hate music, and 

you should hate it too.
After all, what is music if 
it isn’t something to dump 
on? Taking what people love, 
analyzing it piece by piece 
and ripping it to shreds to 
invalidate their enjoyment is 
what I thrive on. I just want to 

take your favorite album and 
show you why it’s so terrible 
until you hate it yourself. What, 
you thought I listened to music 
because I like it?
Just kidding! I love music.
A lot of people know me 
for my notorious dislikes. I 
could aggravate K-pop fans in 
an instant with my sweeping 
criticisms of the genre. My 
friends would put J. Cole on 
the aux at my own party just 
to mess with me. If I want to 
turn a whole room against me, 
all I have to do is say “I think 
Lana Del Rey is kind of boring” 
— that’s always been a very 
unpopular take.
Talking 
about 
my 
dislikes 
was 
pretty exciting 
for 
me 
early 
in my music-
appreciating 
career. 
As 
soon 
as 
I 
crossed 
some 
threshold 
of 
having listened 
to enough hip 
hop, I felt like 
I was qualified 
to 
make 
assessments 
on big releases 
in 
the 
genre. 
At some point 
I found myself 
questioning: 
Why am I full 
of 
dislikes? 
Do I think so 
highly 
of 
my 
own 
opinion 
that I assume 
everyone 
else 
is wrong and 
I’m 
on 
some 
sort of mission 
to correct them? Can’t I just let 
people who like J. Cole live in 
peace?
Well, turns out there is joy to 
be had in saying: “Your favorite 
album 
sucks.” 
Last 
year 
I 

attended a few meetings for 
Hip Hop Congress, a rap music 
production 
and 
appreciation 
club 
at 
the 
University. 
If 
those meetings 
were 
any 
indicator, 
sharing 
hot 
takes 
and 
strong negative 
opinions 
is 
really prevalent 
in the hip-hop 
community. 
I 
was definitely 
partaking 
in 
the smack talk 
myself. 
But 
that experience 
helped 
me 
realize 
something: 
The 
joy 
isn’t 
in 
changing 
other people’s 
opinions 
or 
ruining 
their 
favorites 
for 
them. 
The 
fun is in the 
debate and the 
argument.
Maybe that’s 
why 
I 
like 
doing what I do 
so much. I can’t help but think 
critically about why I like and 
don’t like music — I’ll be doing 
that in my head whether I’m 
writing it down or not — but 
putting that opinion into words 

is a springboard for debate. 
Debate might be one of the most 
fulfilling ways to appreciate art.
Arguing is all fun and good. 
The hip-hop head in me is 
always ready to defend an 
unconventional Kanye album 
ranking. However, I want to be 
known for the music I love, not 
the music I hate. I don’t get joy 
out of making 
people dislike 
an album they 
previously 
liked. On the 
other 
hand, 
nothing 
matches 
the 
excitement 
of 
getting 
someone 
to 
take a chance 
on an album 
they 
never 
would 
have 
considered before.
A real passion has started 
to emerge for me in finding 
music that means something to 
other people. In 2019, I fell in 
love with slowthai, SOPHIE, 
JPEGMAFIA 
and 
so 
many 
more game-changing acts in 
music. The only joy greater 
than listening to those artists is 
introducing them to my friends.
The other night, I picked 
up my brother and his friends 
from the bar. The day before, 
I had introduced him to the 
unconventional music of 100 
gecs. I don’t know how to 

articulate the surrealness of 
four drunk frat bros rolling into 
my car at one in the morning 
demanding 
I 
play 
“money 
machine.”
That’s the kind of domino 
effect I want to start as a 
devoted appreciator of music. 
So I’ve started to focus on 
talking more about music I love.
Nowadays, when I 
run into friends at a 
party, they’ll ask my 
thoughts on the new 
BROCKHAMPTON 
album, 
the 
new 
Kero 
Kero 
Bonito 
EP or the new Rina 
Sawayama 
single. 
One pal of mine texts 
me artists I should 
try 
all 
the 
time. 
Many of my fellow 
music writers also 
love 
Rex 
Orange 
County, so when Pony came 
out, I didn’t want to call dibs 
on reviewing it — but it was my 
team on the Music beat that said 
I had to write about it.
At some point, three out 
of five songs on my Spotify 
top-five-most-listened 
being 
by Kero Kero Bonito became 
funnier 
than 
my 
mocking 
impression of J. Cole’s “Wet 
Dreamz.” That’s something I’m 
pretty okay with. Bad albums 
will still get no mercy from me. 
But my 2020 will be all about 
artists that are pushing music 
forward, not holding it back.

Daily Arts Writer

I want to be 
known for the 
music I love, not 
the music I hate.

Three singles enter. One 
couple leaves. Yes, this is 
exactly how dystopian “Flirty 
Dancing” feels on a first 
viewing.
The American version of 
the popular UK reality series, 
“Flirty Dancing” follows two 
single people who are looking 
for love in the most traditional 
way: 
pre-choreographed, 
partnered 
dance 
routines. 
Each contestant learns two 
dances — one for each of their 
possible matches — and must 
perform the routines when 
they first meet their partner. 
After both dances are finished, 
the main contestant decides 
which of the two partners they 
want to go on a first date with. 
The series premiere featured 
Octavius (a choir teacher) 
and Erin (a hairdresser) as 
the main single contestants. 
Their 
professions, 
along 
with a few simple adjectives 
like “playful” or “cute,” are 
offered to introduce the two, 
as the show opts for likability 

over nuance or complexity. 
Their prospective suitors are 
described only briefly and 
have little say in choosing the 
specifics of the dance, even 
in one case where a female 
contestant expressed strong 
opposition 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
intimate 
touching 
the 

choreography required. This 
matter was quickly resolved, 
as “Flirty Dancing” does not 
dwell on the negative. There’s 
no crying in choreographed 
dance routines.
Hosted 
by 
celebrity 
dancer Jenna Dewan, “Flirty 

Dancing” seems sweet enough 
and even wholesome in its 
wildly optimistic premise. Can 
two people fall in love without 
knowing anything about each 
other? Can you know a person 
just from physical chemistry 
and prolonged eye contact? 
Where reality dating shows 
like “The Bachelor” or “Love 
Island” assume that people can 
find true love through short 
interactions in a group setting, 
“Flirty Dancing” emphasizes 
that one-on-one connections 
can bring couples together. 
Though the intentions of the 
show are good in theory, the 
actual end product seems more 
akin to weirdly staged dance 
propaganda 
than 
anything 
even 
slightly 
resembling 
genuine 
emotion. 
Each 
interview with the contestants 
feels highly scripted, footage 
of the dances is heavily edited 
and clearly shot in more than 
one take, and the sheer amount 
of eye contact is unnerving, no 
matter how “playful” or “cute” 
the contestants are. 
In a move that is both sadistic 
and a bit hilarious, the show 
stages the main contestant’s 
final choice of which partner 

they’d like to date by having 
both dancers show up at a 
restaurant. While this creates 
a sweet moment for the reveal 
of their choice, it implies the 
unchosen dancer is stood up 
and never given an explanation 
for why. Despite this, everyone 
featured on “Flirty Dancing” 
constantly praises the show 
and 
assures 
the 
audience 
that 
their 
experience 
was 
overwhelmingly 
positive. 
Their 
confessionals, 
which 
are 
usually 
opportunities 
for reality shows to directly 
connect with audiences and 
deliver genuine commentary, 
are so robotic and saccharine 
that you begin to wonder 
whether they’re hostages in 
this dance-fueled utopia they 
claim to love so much.
“Flirty Dancing” fundamentally 
assumes it has already won the 
viewers over. By hitting all 
the baseline requirements of a 
dating show with little effort 
or nuance, “Flirty Dancing” 
figures the appearance of utter 

perfection translates to quality 
television. Unfortunately for 
the new FOX series, this is 
simply not true. In pretending 
everyone 
and 
everything 
is picture-perfect from the 
start, “Flirty Dancing” fails 
to deliver the reality of reality 
TV.

TV REVIEW

ANDERS KRUSBERG / PEABODY AWARD

Over the years, returning 
home for break has seemed 
to feel more and more like 
returning to a state of limbo. At 
first, my homecoming felt like 
a return to form, or something 
familiar. I was only out of 
high school for a few months, 
and home still felt the way it 
should. But, after spending 
most of my time in Ann Arbor 
for 
the 
past 
three 
years, 
something about going back 
to my hometown feels slightly 
off. Either way, after a long fall 
semester, having two weeks 
to do nothing in particular 
sounded pretty nice.
So, for the first few days of 
winter break, I did just that. 
But then came the inevitable 
stress that comes with being 
around your family during the 
holiday season. I started to 
become dissatisfied with doing 
nothing for so many days in a 
row (something that’s all too 
common among people my age, 
unfortunately), 
and 
needed 
to do something to clear my 
headspace. I needed a creative 
outlet.
But all of my instruments 
were back in Ann Arbor — how 
was I supposed to manifest 
these 
creative 
desires? 
I 
journaled regularly, but I felt a 
need for something else. Then 
I recalled just a few months 
prior, when my housemates and 
I tried something that I had 
never done before: painting.
I reached out to a few of my 
remaining hometown friends 
and asked them if they wanted 
to paint. With some cheap 
supplies leftover from our arts 
and crafts days, some snacks, 
and music, we were ready 

to search for our muse. This 
proved to be quite hard for 
a few indecisive people that 
don’t regularly paint. So I went 
to the place I usually went to 
for inspiration: the internet. 
On that particular day, I saw 
that dictionary.com’s word of 
the day was “splore - a frolic; 
revel; carousel;.” With that, we 
were off — painting whatever 
came to our minds and showing 
off our progress along the way.
This was easily one of the 
most refreshing things I did 
over this past winter break. 
It can often be uncomfortable 
to try to express your ideas 
in a medium that you’re not 
technically 
proficient 
in 
because 
of 
the 
underlying 
desire 
to 
make 
something 
perfect. 
This 
perfectionism 
is something that stops many 
from creating or sharing their 
work, and something that I 
struggled with for a while. 
However, DIY has helped me 
shrug off that feeling that 
my art needs to be perfect. 
Creating 
art 
for 
the 
sole 
purpose of creating is one of 
the most liberating you can do 
not only as an artist, but as a 
person. Surrounding myself 
with supportive peers in an 
environment 
that 
supports 
even the most unfinished art 
has completely changed my 
originally unhealthy thoughts 
on artistry.
Bringing an idea into this 
world can be an incredibly 
therapeutic 
experience. 
It 
helps me clear my head, even 
when it’s been exceptionally 
cloudy. 
Thinking 
back 
to 
my break freshman year, I 
don’t think I would have ever 
gone outside and painted my 
interpretation of the word 
“splore.” After being shown 
the 
beauty 
of 
abandoning 
perfectionism, here we are.

Wolverines 
fall to
Spartans,
87-69, in East 
Lansing

ABBY SNYDER
Daily Sports Writer

MEN’S BASKETBALL

EAST LANSING – This game was almost
exactly as advertised.
 Cassius Winston and Xavier Tillman: stifling on 
defense and prolific on offense. As advertised. 
Tom Izzo: calculating game manager, passion-
ate coach. As advertised. The Spartan faithful: 
loud. Like, really loud. As advertised. 
 Michigan, too, was just as advertised. The 
Wolverines played with plenty of juice, the 
excitement of this rivalry seeming to fuel them, 
and for a while, they stayed with Michigan 
State.
 But eventually, it was too much for them. Till-
man and Winston were too dynamic on offense, 
their arms and hands somehow everywhere at 
once on defense. Izzo was too experienced with 
this game and with this Michigan program, his 
game plan capitalizing on the scoring droughts 
that have plagued these Wolverines all season. 
 And so, No. 12 Michigan fell to in-state 
archrival No. 14 Michigan State, 87-69, at the 
Breslin Center on Sunday. The offense struggled 
to put the ball in the basket and the defense could 
not contain the Spartans’ top scoring threats.
 Just as advertised. 
 “I think we hesitated a lot, and second-guessed 
ourselves, which kind of helps us to miss,” said 
sophomore forward Brandon Johns, Jr., who had 
12 points and two rebounds on the day. “I think 
we need to be more confident when we’re shoot-
ing. It’s a mental thing. We just have to stay 
mentally strong, mentally composed. 
 “The more we do that, the more our shots 
will fall.”
 Michigan State jumped out to an early lead 
as Michigan’s offense seemed to falter at 
the beginning, scoring just six points before 
the under-16 timeout. The defense also had 
trouble containing Spartan point guard and 

potential National Player of the Year Cassius Winston and forward 
Xavier Tillman, allowing Michigan State to jump out to a five-point 
lead around the 15-minute mark. 
 But by halfway through the first half, the Wolverines managed to 
make it a two-point game behind a strong effort from senior point 
guard Zavier Simpson and senior center Austin Davis. A quick-
er pace of play, something that rookie Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard has continued to stress throughout his first season at the 
helm for Michigan, seemed to be the key for the Wolverines, who 
started to match the speed of the Spartans in transition.
 Michigan’s success was short-lived, though. From there, the 
Wolverines’ shots just weren’t falling; they scored just five points 
between the ten- and six-minute marks. The loss of top-scoring 
junior forward Isaiah Livers was painfully evident. At the end of 
the first half, Michigan State led, 44-34.
 “It was a big win for us, because the final score was not indic-
ative of the game,” said Michigan State coach Tom Izzo. “We got 
that eleven, twelve-point lead, but we just couldn’t build on it. It’s a 
credit to them.” 
 From there, the game was never really in question. The Wolver-
ines came out of the halftime break playing as physical as they have 
all year, seemingly in an effort not to go too quietly, but even then, 
it was too little, too late. The Spartans had found their rhythm, and 
Michigan could not find a way to shake it. Tillman and Winston were 

practically unstoppable, and in the entire second half, the Wolverines 

found themselves within closer than ten points of the Spartans just 

twice. 

 Every Michigan effort seemed to come up short as Michigan State 
expanded its lead to the delighted cries of the rabid crowd at Breslin. Every 
time a maize jersey broke away, he was surrounded by white in a matter of 
seconds as Spartan shot after Spartan shot found nothing but net – and not a 
Wolverine in sight to stop them. 
 “Unfortunately for us, we didn’t do a good job communicating on the open 
man, and where he was, so that’s why they were able to score so much in tran-
sition,” Howard said. “There’s no excuses for that. We prepared for it. We just 
didn’t do it. And at the end of the day, you have to do your job.”
 In the end, it wasn’t that close. Michigan State’s talent and experience 
proved too much for this Michigan team. 
 Just as advertised.

Shooting troubles plague Michigan

EAST LANSING — Brick 
by brick, Michigan laid the 
foundation of its own downfall. 
Whether it was beyond the 
arc, from the elbow or along 
the baseline, the Wolverines 
struggled to knock down shots 
for three-quarters of Sunday’s 
18-point, 87-69 drubbing at the 
hands of No. 14 Michigan State. 
A fairly even contest through 
the first ten minutes gradually 
eroded into Michigan being 
forced to play catch-up.
Without 
leading 
scorer, 
junior forward Isaiah Livers, 
the Wolverines had nowhere 
to turn offensively when the 
Spartans’ All-American point 
guard Cassius Winston caught 
fire. 
While 
Winston, 
who 
finished with 32 points on 
11-of-19 shooting, orchestrated 
his team’s offense to perfection, 
Michigan’s offense sputtered. 
Senior point guard Zavier 
Simpson and senior center Jon 
Teske did their best to keep 
the Wolverines in the game, 
but 
poor 
3-point 
shooting 
from Simpson — 1-for-6 — and 
foul trouble for Teske meant 
that Michigan’s attack was too 
inconsistent. 
“Give Teske credit, he went 
to work on us early in there,” 
said Michigan State coach Tom 

Izzo. “I didn’t like the way we 
covered him at times. But, we 
made some adjustments and 
got a little better in the second 
half.”
With Teske on the bench, the 
Wolverines lacked an offensive 
focal point and resorted to 
hoisting up some ill-advised 
shots. This was especially true 
from 
3-point 
range, 
where 
Michigan went 5-of-23 over the 
course of the game. 
In 
Livers’ 
absence, 
sophomore forward Brandon 
Johns Jr. stepped in at the ‘4.’ 
Johns Jr. may be of the same 
athletic ilk as Livers, but less 
polished offensively. Despite 
scoring 12 points in 30 minutes, 
Johns Jr. shot 25 percent from 
three. 
The rest of the Wolverines’ 
rotation didn’t fare any better. 
Junior guard Eli Brooks, who 
upped his offensive production 
significantly from last season, 
was limited to five shots — 
missing all four of his 3-point 
attempts. 
The 
Spartans 
chased 
Michigan’s shooters off their 
spots, something that they 
emphasized going in. 
“We wanted to take away 
their threes,” Izzo said. “We 
didn’t give up the wide-open 
threes.
“We did a pretty good job on 
Brooks and (sophomore guard) 

David DeJulius, and I think 
that was one of the differences. 
(Freshman 
forward 
Franz) 
Wagner hit one, too, but we did 
a decent job on what we had to 
do to win the game.” 
Without 
Livers 
and 
his 
shooting 
threat, 
Michigan 
coach 
Juwan 
Howard 
was 
forced to play more of his 
bigs. As a result, the paint 
looked more congested and 
opportunities to attack the 
basket were harder to come by. 
“Isaiah 
would’ve 
helped 
(with 
the 
spacing),” 
Teske 
said. “But that’s no excuse. 
We always say, ‘Next man up.’ 
Brandon played well tonight 
and we trust him to do that.”
The 
Wolverines’ 
poor 
shooting 
on 
the 
road 
has 
become an alarming trend and 
one that reared its ugly head 
again in East Lansing. 36.2 
percent from the field isn’t a 
recipe for success in Big Ten 
play — especially when Winston 
and Michigan State’s offense 
hums like it did on Sunday.
The answer to improving 
these 
woes 
according 
to 
Michigan: keep working. 
“There 
were 
some 
shots 
that didn’t fall,” Howard said. 
“Unfortunately for us, it’s been 
our norm going on the road that 
our threes don’t fall for us. We 
just gotta keep forging ahead 
and mentally stay with it.”

J

uwan Howard hasn’t shied 
away from calling Zavier 
Simpson his quarterback.
In his first season as the 
Michigan 
men’s bas-
ketball 
coach, How-
ard inherit-
ed a proven 
senior point 
guard. 
Simpson, 
one of the 
nation’s 
craftiest 
passers and 
elite perimeter defenders, has 
been the Wolverines’ backbone 
since he became the team’s 
starting point guard halfway 
through his sophomore season.
Even after a coaching change 
forced him into a new system, 
Simpson has remained produc-
tive. Simpson leads the Big Ten 
in assists with 8.9 per game, 
and if you ask anyone around 
the program about his work 
ethic, they’ll tell you that above 
all, he wants to win. That pair-
ing of production and attitude 
makes it easy to see why How-
ard likens him to Tom Brady.
But over the last month, 
Michigan has seen a different 
version of the Zavier Simpson 
that piloted the team’s 7-0 start 
this season. Through the first 
month of the schedule, oppos-
ing defenses gave Simpson 
the opportunity to play to his 
strengths. And as one of the 
country’s best pick-and-roll 
ball handlers, he put together a 
highlight film of assists.
Whether it was throwing 
alley-oops to senior center Jon 
Teske or creating improbable 
angles to find shooters along 
the perimeter, Simpson’s abil-
ity to create offense out of the 
pick-and-roll fueled a high-
octane offense.
Until it didn’t.
In the Wolverines’ loss to 
Louisville on Dec. 3, Cardinals’ 
coach Chris Mack cracked the 
code. Louisville hedged hard 
on screens, making it difficult 
for Simpson to invent the same 
passing angles that made Mich-
igan’s offense so successful in 
wins over then-No. 6 North 

Carolina and now-No. 1 Gon-
zaga at the Battle 4 Atlantis.
“It starts with Zavier,” Mack 
said after the game. “The deep-
er he gets in the lane, the more 
it puts your off-ball defenders 
in a bind. How much do I help 
in? In the Bahamas, he’d just 
get in the lane and spray it out, 
and (junior forward Isaiah) 
Livers and (junior guard Eli) 
Brooks, they couldn’t miss. 
And so all we talked about was 
keeping him out of the lane, 
and then hard closeouts.”
When the Cardinals didn’t 
hedge hard, they played Simp-
son for the drive. They sagged 
off. They dared Howard’s Tom 
Brady to shoot.
And surely enough, as Mack 
predicted, the Wolverines are 
at their worst when their quar-
terback becomes their shooter.
In Michigan’s 10 wins, Simp-
son averages 7.6 attempts from 
the field at an efficient 59-per-
cent clip, which would be the 
third-best overall mark in the 
conference. But in the Wolver-
ines’ four losses, he averages 
13.5 shots. Increased volume, 
though, has brought the oppo-
site of increased effectiveness, 
as Simpson shoots just 31 per-
cent from the field in losses.
Simpson’s assist numbers, 
too, trend in opposite direc-
tions based on gameflow. He 
dishes out an average of 9.4 
assists in wins, but just 7.5 in 
losses.
Together, Simpson’s shoot-
ing and assist splits often tell 
the story of Michigan’s fate. 
When the Wolverines have fall-
en behind, Simpson has grown 

more aggressive. In an effort to 
will his team back into games, 
he drives to the rim at a higher 
rate and takes more contested 
shots. 
The most recent example 
came on Sunday in East Lan-
sing, where Simpson struggled 
to a 6-for-18 shooting perfor-
mance, including a 1-of-6 mark 
from deep. And it’s no coinci-
dence that Michigan was star-
ing at an 18-point loss by the 
end of the afternoon.
With Livers and his 13.6 
points per game now sidelined 
indefinitely, the Wolverines are 
at a crossroads. Simpson will 
always be at the offense’s helm, 
but the team’s best output 
comes when he’s orchestrat-
ing the scoring, not creating 
it. While he may be the team’s 
third-leading scorer, making 
up for Livers’ lost production 
needs to fall on Brooks, fresh-
man wing Franz Wagner and 
sophomore guard David DeJu-
lius.
If Michigan is to contend 
for a Big Ten title, Simpson 
has to play his brand of bas-
ketball. And with three of the 
team’s next four games coming 
against teams either nation-
ally-ranked or receiving poll 
votes, there will be times when 
he’s tempted to stray from 
exactly that.
But for the Wolverines’ 
offense to weather Livers’ 
absence, their quarterback has 
to facilitate it — not produce it.

AST LANSING — Maybe 
the most surprising part 
of Sunday afternoon was 
how inevita-
ble it all felt.
As Cas-
sius Winston 
walked off 
the Breslin 
Center floor 
for the last 
time with 16 
seconds left 
in the game, 
a final hail-
storm of noise 
coming down, Zavier Simpson’s 
hands were on his hips. Every-
one’s hands were on their hips. 
At least those wearing maize.
They looked at each other. 
They glanced at the floor. They 
had no answers, and never real-
ly came close to finding any.
Really, as soon as Michigan 
showed up in East Lansing 
with Isaiah Livers donning 
sweats during warmups, it felt 
like it would take something 
unforeseen to win the game. 
Even when the game stayed 
within arm’s reach, Michigan 
State’s lead hovering at 10 or 11 
throughout the second half, it 
felt like a mountain. 
All of Michigan’s warts 
were magnified without Livers 
— a 50-percent shooter from 
3-point range, a capable ball-
handler, a versatile defender. 
Its lack of depth and its lack of 
experience chief among them. 
“We had them scrambling, 
couldn’t really set up,” Winston 
said. “We were making plays 
like that.”
Of all the elements that 
have come to define Michigan-
Michigan State, a sense of pre-
determination hasn’t been one 
in a long time. But the Spartans 
walked off the floor with an 
87-69 win that never came into 
doubt, not from the moment it 
became clear that Livers would 
miss the game with a groin 
injury.
The Spartans collapsed the 

floor against Zavier Simpson, 
daring the Wolverines to shoot. 
They shot an abysmal 5-of-23 
from 3-point range. When they 
missed, Michigan State beat 
them down the floor, as Michi-
gan struggled to match — or 
keep — up. 
By the end of the first half, 
the Spartans had 44 points — 
the most Michigan has allowed 
in a first half since a Nov. 29, 
2017 loss at North Carolina, 
before Simpson was the start-
ing point guard and before the 
Wolverines went two straight 
years with a top-five defense in 
adjusted efficiency.
Right now, the Wolverines 
are 29th in adjusted defensive 
efficiency. They’re 24th in 
adjusted offensive efficiency, 
and in three true road games 

— all losses — they’re shoot-
ing 18.3 percent from three. 
They’re startlingly dependent 
on the three players left who 
played over 50 percent of min-
utes on last year’s team: Simp-
son, Livers and Jon Teske.
Without Livers, Michigan 
needed Brandon Johns Jr. to 
step into his role, confidently 
take 3-pointers and defend any-
one put in front of him.
“He’s disappointed,” Michi-
gan coach Juwan Howard said 
of Johns, after a performance 
in which solid top-line numbers 
belied a 1-of-4 performance 
from three. “He’ll probably tell 
you right now that he played 
badly.”
Without Livers, Michigan 
needed Franz Wagner to hit 
shots from outside and space 

the floor. Desperately.
“Wagner hit one,” Michigan 
State coach Tom Izzo said, 
after his team held Wagner 
to just three attempts from 
3-point range, a low-impact 
performance. “But we did a 
decent job and (what) we had to 
do to win the game.”
Without Livers, Michigan 
needed Eli Brooks and David 
DeJulius to take some of the 
load off Simpson.
“We did a pretty good job on 
Brooks and David DeJulius,” 
Izzo said, after his team held 
them to a combined 4-of-14 
from the field. “And I think 
that was the difference.”
Howard was predictably 
noncommittal when asked 
about Livers’ status for Thurs-
day’s game against Purdue, say-

ing only that Michigan would 
“take a look at it.” It’s hard 
to pick apart what on Sunday 
happened because of Livers’ 
absence and what happened 
because of problems that might 
have existed either way. 
The right answer might be 
somewhere in the middle.
These problems were there 
when Michigan lost at Louis-
ville, came up short in overtime 
against Oregon and couldn’t 
get going at Illinois. On Sunday, 
without Livers, they multiplied 
in severity, and his return 
might cover up those issues 
against some teams. But that 
would only serve to belie the 
point.
Simpson, Livers and Teske 
are the only three players on 
Michigan’s team who have 

played a big role in a road win 
of the kind Sunday’s would 
have been. They’re the only 
three who battled through a 
run to the national champion-
ship game in 2018. (Brooks was 
on that team, but essentially 
out of the rotation by that point 
in the year). 
Experience like that breeds 
confidence — something the 
rest of the Wolverines seem to 
lack, both during the game and 
afterwards, when they talked 
about second-guessing open 
shots and communicating more 
on defense. Those two areas 
don’t tend to be concerns on 
experienced, confident teams.
“You’ve just got to believe 
you can make it,” assistant 
coach Saddi Washington said 
of the shooting woes. “It’s defi-
nitely not a lack of ability. But 
you’ve got to step up and shoot 
the ball with confidence.”
“You’ve got to sprint back, 
but you also have to run with 
vision,” Howard said of the 
problems in transition. “Guys 
have got to be talking so that 
we’re getting matched up and 
not allowing easy layups or 
open 3s in transition.” 
This is the fine line between 
a top-20 team and a top-five 
team. There’s ample time for 
Michigan to grow past what it 
is right now — ample oppor-
tunities for Wagner, Johns, 
Brooks and DeJulius to grow 
into the players Michigan 
needs them to be. Two years 
ago, Simpson, Charles Mat-
thews and Jordan Poole did 
just that. That team wasn’t 
ranked until January, and, in 
the interest of fairness, nobody 
expected the Wolverines to be 
a top-20 team before the sea-
son — they raised that bar with 
their play in November.
Now, it’s on them to raise it 
again.

Pearson increasing focus on details 
going into second half of the season

After Michigan’s loss to 
Michigan Tech last Tuesday, 
coach Mel Pearson — as he 
always does — went back to look 
at the tape from the game. This 
time, he noticed something he 
thought may have been the key 
factor in his team’s 4-2 loss to 
the Huskies.
The 
Wolverines 
had 
37 
shots on goal, including 20 in 
the first period, but only had 
traffic in front of Michigan 
Tech goaltender Matt Jurusik 
on two of those 37 shots.
“We watched a lot of hockey 
over the weekend, NHL (and) 
college games,” Pearson said 
Monday. 
“When 
you 
start 
breaking down goals and how 
they’re going in, usually there’s 
a lot of traffic. … We need to get 
traffic.”
It’s no secret that offense has 
been one of the biggest issues 
for Michigan this season, and 
its anemic average of 2.25 
goals per game 
ranks 48th of 
60 teams in the 
country. When 
there 
aren’t 
bodies in front 
of 
the 
net, 
the 
opposing 
goaltender has 
more time to 
see the shots 
coming 
at 
him. And not 
having a skater on the doorstep 
eliminates any chance of a 
rebound opportunity after a 
save.
For the second half of the 
season, Pearson’s main focus 
for 
his 
team 
is 
increased 
attention to detail. So far, 
that’s entailed getting bodies 
in front of the net to take the 
goaltender’s eyes away and 
readying for rebound chances. 
In 
Monday’s 
practice, 
the 
majority of the drills were 

focused on exactly that.
“Attention to detail, even 
when you do little drills, 
someone getting in front of the 
goalie or constantly standing 
to the side of the net,” Pearson 
said. “It’s not fun to get hit 
with that puck, it 
hurts a little bit, 
but you’ve gotta 
get there. You’ve 
gotta 
pay 
that 
price.”
Outside of the 
focus on getting 
bodies 
to 
the 
net, 
Pearson 
wants to see the 
Wolverines 
put 
more 
emphasis 
on all aspects of the game. 
Whether that’s a small detail of 
the forecheck system or making 
sure to stay focused mentally 
late in games, it all counts.
“There’s certain things we 
do when we’re either down or 
tied that we do really well and 
then once we get the lead, we 
start trying to change those 
kinds of things in our game,” 
senior 
defenseman 
Luke 
Martin said. “I don’t know 
what it is, whether it’s mental 

or what the deal is.”
Michigan has 11 losses this 
season, but only three have 
come by more than one even-
strength goal. In three games, 
the other team scored an 
empty-net goal late to win by 
a two-goal margin. On the flip 
side, the Wolverines have won 
only one game by a single goal 
— their six other wins have at 
least a two-goal margin.
When 
they 
can 
create 
separation, 
they 
can 
win. 
When it’s a close game, they 
frequently fall short. These 
things matter in must-win 
games.
“We’ve been really good for 
the most part and then a bad 
play or just a mental lapse has 
hurt us,” Pearson said. “I think 
the biggest thing is we just 
have to clean some things up 
and a little attention to detail. 
They’re not huge things. And 
then the other thing is just we 
have to get everybody on the 
same page.”
“... We’re just finding ways 
to lose games instead of win 
games, and we’re not far off, 
but winning can be habit and 
losing can.”

‘M’ falls short against Oregon State

As Jackson Striggow walked 
onto 
the 
mat 
in 
the 
day’s 
penultimate match, he knew what 
he needed to do to keep Michigan 
alive. A win from the senior, even 
by a decision, would pull the 
Wolverines within four points. 
With the nation’s third ranked 
heavyweight, sophomore Mason 
Parris, coming up next, Michigan 
could have pulled out a win. 
Striggow, however, fell 5-3, 
squashing the Wolverines’ hopes, 
as the No. 22 Michigan wrestling 
team (1-2) fell to Oregon State 
(3-1), 21-15. The six deciding points 
came from a Michigan forfeit 
at 133 pounds, where it failed to 
make weight.
Sophomore 
Jack 
Medley 
tried to set the tone early for the 
Wolverines, opening the meet 
with an 11-0 major decision at 125 
pounds. The match saw him get an 
early takedown and continue the 
attack through all three periods.
“I felt pretty decent in my 
match,” Medley said. “I thought 
my energy could’ve been a bit 
better, I kinda forced myself to 
hustle back to the center.”
Medley’s 
performance 
put 

Michigan 
up 
4-0, 
but 
was 
immediately overshadowed by the 
forfeit at 133 pounds, taking away 
the Wolverines’ only lead of the 
day.
The next match at 141 set the 
tone as freshman Cole Mattin led 
for the majority of the match but 
failed to see it out, losing 6-5.
“Our finishing was not good 
enough today,” Michigan coach 
Sean Bormet said. “We’re capable 
of being much better at finishing.”
Mattin started a string of 
matches where the Wolverines 
lost three of four, with their only 
win coming from freshman Will 
Lewan at 157 — keeping Michigan 
from falling behind by double 
figures.
Freshman Max Maylor came 
up with only four matches left and 
an eight-point deficit to overcome. 
Maylor earned a major decision 
in his match, cutting the Beavers’ 
lead in half. 
“Maylor wrestled a really good 
match,” Bormet said. “Really glad 
to see him penetrate and get his 
offense early in that match.”
Maylor’s match could have 
proved a turning point in the 
match for Michigan, but Oregon 
State had other plans.
Freshman Bobby Striggow fell 

behind by two early and never 
caught up, but he prevented the 
Beavers from getting bonus points, 
losing by decision, 8-2.
This put the score at 18-11 
when Bobby’s brother Jackson 
Striggow came out, still just barely 
in reach. Jackson’s 5-3 loss meant 
the undefeated Parris would have 
no impact on the outcome of the 
meet. Despite the gap, he still 
went out and earned a 15-5 major 
decision to bring the final score to 
21-15.
The main separator between 
the two teams ended up being 
the Wolverines’ inability to win 
close matches or finish strong 
when they held the lead. Michigan 
consistently took an early lead in 
the first period, but then failed to 
close the match out.
“We put guys out there that we 
knew were gonna be in some close 
matches,” Bormet said. “We felt 
confident we could still win those 
close matches, unfortunately we 
did not.
“I’m a little disappointed in a 
few of our weight classes just in 
terms of how we wrestled in those 
matches. Some of the effort we put 
in a few of those positions, that’s 
gotta improve. The expectation is 
a lot higher.”

Shooting leads Wolverines past MSU

Near the end of the third 
quarter, the Wolverines saw 
the game slipping away. 
Michigan 
State 
forward 
Madreika Cook had just buried 
a 3-pointer, and a Michigan 
turnover and foul allowed the 
Spartans to cut the Wolverines’ 
lead to one. Michigan State (8-6 
overall, 1-2 Big Ten) had all the 
momentum, and “Go Green, Go 
White” chants rang through an 
otherwise silent Crisler Center. 
Michigan (11-3, 2-1) got its 
answer from sophomore guard 
Amy Dilk. Just before time 
expired, she caught a pass 
from junior forward Hailey 
Brown, set her feet and buried 
a 3-pointer. From there, the 
Wolverines 
dominated 
all 
the way through, securing a 
signature 89-69 win over their 
in-state rival.
At the start, the Spartans 
set the tone offensively with 
a 
3-pointer 
on 
their 
first 
possession. They relied heavily 
on the three early on, shooting 
3-of-6 from beyond the arc 
in the first quarter, including 
two makes from guard Taryn 
McCutcheon. 
The Wolverines, meanwhile, 
went 
to 
their 
bread 
and 
butter and attacked the rim. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon was unsurprisingly 
the most productive at the 
hoop. Though she shot an 
unusually inefficient 3-for-11 
in the first half, she managed 
to draw fouls at the rim and 
converted 
on 
5-of-6 
free 
throws. She finished the first 
half with 11 points. 
“(We needed to) match her 
energy,” said Michigan State 
coach Suzy Merchant. “The kid 
wants the ball, she ducks in, she 
can score the ball. … If you’re 
gonna have any chance to beat 
Naz, you have to have someone 
on your team that can do the 
same thing that she can do at 
the same level of intensity, and 
we didn’t have that.”
Hillmon’s 
success 
down 
low was made easier by Dilk’s 
ability to pass the ball and 
drive the lane. She tallied 

three assists and no turnovers 
— which had been a problem 
earlier in the season — in the 
first half, and added eight first 
half points of her own, six of 
which came at the hoop. 
“I think that all of my 
teammates 
being 
such 
offensive threats opened up 
the paint for me to be able to 
get those shots,” Hillmon said. 
“Especially Amy driving in and 
attacking the basket, people 
had to really focus in on her 
and worry about the outside 
shooter, so it just really opened 
everything up.”
Michigan’s 
ability to force 
turnovers helped 
it 
to 
carry 
a 
35-32 lead into 
halftime. 
The 
Wolverines 
picked up three 
steals 
in 
the 
second 
quarter 
alone 
— 
two 
of which came 
from senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson. Johnson used her 
speed and length to cut down 
a number of Michigan State 
possessions, especially when 
defending the pick-and-roll. 
When a miscommunication left 
a Spartan forward open under 
the basket for what looked 
like a guaranteed two points, 
Johnson jumped in and swiped 
the ball out of her hands. 
“We focus on defense a 
lot,” Hillmon said. “We want 
to pressure them and make 
it 
uncomfortable 
for 
them 
because we know that a lot of 
times teams do that do us.”

In the third quarter, both 
defenses 
disappeared. 
As 
Michigan State shot 69 percent 
in the quarter — and making 
both of its 3-point attempts 
— Michigan needed its own 
answer on offense. 
At a crucial juncture where 
the Spartans hit a pair of quick 
buckets to cut the lead to 
three, the Wolverines looked 
in danger of letting the game 
slip away. But on the next 
possession, Dilk drove to the 
basket and picked up a layup 
and a foul. She missed the 
free 
throw, 
but 
got 
her 
own 
rebound, 
leading 
to 
a 
3-pointer 
from 
Brown 
that stretched 
Michigan’s lead 
back to eight. 
Dilk’s buzzer-
beating 
shot 
would cap off 
a third quarter 
where the Wolverines shot an 
astounding 91 percent. 
In the fourth quarter, it was 
all Michigan. The Wolverines 
went on a 16-0 run — Michigan 
State didn’t score for the first 
five minutes of the quarter — 
that put any hopes of a Spartan 
comeback to bed. In a game that 
felt evenly matched through 
three 
quarters, 
Michigan’s 
strong second half shooting 
— they shot 78 percent from 
the field in the second half — 
propelled it to a convincing 
win, not just over a quality 
opponent, but over its biggest 
rival.

No. 5 Michigan reaps rewards of 
offseason in Orange Bowl Classic

The 
words 
“hard 
work” 
and “reward” are rarely used 
to describe the same thing. 
Usually, the former is seen as 
the latter’s antithesis. 
But according to Michigan 
women’s swim and dive coach 
Mike 
Bottom, 
his 
team’s 
training trip to Florida, which 
began shortly after Christmas 
and concluded with the Orange 
Bowl Classic in Key Largo, Fla. 
this Friday, was both. 
“We go down, we have a 
meet, see how we’ve done and 
where we are,” Bottom said. 
If his team’s performance 
against 
little-known 
foes 
including 
Wisconsin 
La 
Crosse, Florida International, 
and 
Colorado 
and 
Wagner 
Colleges, can function as such a 
barometer, the No. 5 Wolverines 
(3-0 overall, 1-0 Big Ten) appear 
ahead of schedule. Michigan 
did more than sweep every 
entered event; in only one did 
the Wolverines fail to place two 
swimmers in the three medal 
positions. They won the meet 
without the benefit of points 

from the men’s team, a boon 
which other squads could not 
capitalize on. The dominance 
occurred in unfamiliar waters 
— 
conditions 
including 
an 
outdoor, 
short-course 
pool, 
which is not NCAA regulation. 
“The course is a little bit 
different — it’s meters, as 
opposed 
to 
yards,” 
Bottom 
said. “The times are not so 
meaningful, it’s the racing that 
becomes most meaningful in 
the meet.”
Michigan now owns meet 
records in all but two events; 
sophomore Maggie MacNeil 
set two in this year’s rendition 
in the butterfly and backstroke 
sprints. MacNeil also served 
as the opening leg of the 200-
meter medley relay, using her 
two laps of butterfly to help the 
Wolverines’ quartet to a six-
second victory. 
Also on that relay, in a 
breaststroke 
capacity, 
was 
sophomore 
Olivia 
Carter. 
A 
midyear 
transfer 
from 
Georgia, where she was the 
SEC Freshman of the Year 
and got named to the All-SEC 
First Team, Carter arrives with 
expectations as high as her pile 

of hardware.
“She swims a lot of different 
events, so she will be scoring a 
lot of points in different places,” 
Bottom said. 
On Friday, Carter showcased 
her versatility across distances 
and strokes. In addition to 
her 
breaststroke 
entry 
in 
Michigan’s 
victorious 
200-
meter medley relay, she also 
notched a meet record in 
the 100-meter butterfly and 
swam to the touch against her 
teammate, sophomore Victoria 
Kwan, 
in 
the 
200-meter 
butterfly. Kwan won by a tenth 
of a second. 
“(Carter) chose us after a 
lot of research, got to know all 
of our team and our coaching 
staff, we got to know her really 
well as well,” Bottom said. “… 
We’re real fortunate to have her 
and get her into school.”
Carter’s arrival comes at an 
opportune time for Michigan, 
which is preparing for a pair 
of dual meets against No. 15 
Indiana and No. 18 Ohio State. 
“They’re gonna be difficult,” 
Bottom said. “… And then we 
take it from there, just one step 
at a time.”

O

RLANDO, Fla. — Camer-
on McGrone mentioned 

the big plays 
first, taking 
the blame 
for his unit 
without 
explicitly 
saying it.
Michigan 
gave up too 
many, he 
said, and 
that was the key. McGrone 
wasn’t wrong — the defense did 
give up six plays of 20 or more 
yards — but Alabama will do 
that to you. Loaded with a set 
of skill-position players just as 
good as Ohio State’s, if not bet-
ter, Alabama clearly had more 
speed, more athleticism. The 
Crimson Tide won, 35-16, in the 
Citrus Bowl on Wednesday in 
part because of that.
And yet, the defense did what 
it could. Any realistic game-
plan against 
Alabama was 
going to include 
winning in the 
30s or 40s. The 
Crimson Tide’s 
35 points tied 
a season low, 
and they might 
not have even 
gotten that 
many if not for a 
fourth-quarter 
Shea Patterson interception. 
They were just 4-for-10 on third 
down. They were on the field 
for over nine fewer minutes 
than the Wolverines.
Despite the chunk plays, 
Michigan’s defense played as 
well against Alabama as any 
team has this season. There 
are plenty of examples of the 
Wolverines going up against an 
opponent like this and getting 
their pants pulled down — look 
no further than the Buckeyes 
for proof.
This wasn’t that. But it still 
wasn’t enough.

“The defense played lights 
out, so it’s a tough one,” said 
senior quarterback Shea Patter-
son. He knew as well as anyone 
what had happened: the defense 
did as well as you could realis-
tically expect, but the offense 
didn’t hold up its end of the 
bargain.
After Crimson Tide receiver 
Jerry Jeudy torched the Wol-
verines for an opening 85-yard 
touchdown, one where safety 
Dax Hill wasn’t even close to 
keeping up, the Wolverines 
didn’t allow another score for 
10 minutes. In the first half, 
Michigan was in scoring posi-
tion four times to Alabama’s 
twice. But the Wolverines came 
away with just 16 points, lead-
ing by two at the half.
“That was huge as well,” Pat-
terson said. “Any time you get 
the ball you want to put points 
on the board but when you get 
in the red zone, you gotta score 
touchdowns and that hurt us 
tonight.”
Asked about 
Don Brown’s 
feelings on all 
this, McGrone 
noted his 
defensive coor-
dinator’s disap-
pointment. This 
wasn’t the way 
any of them 
wanted the 
season to end, 
and for Brown in particular, it 
was just the latest in a string of 
missed opportunities to make 
a statement on the biggest stage.
Once again, Brown is going to 
head into an offseason of criti-
cism, and in some ways, that’s 
justified. Brown’s lost big games 
in pretty much every way — 
overtime heartbreakers, being 
caught off guard early, falling 
apart in the fourth quarter. This 
time, his unit seemed prepared. 
It played well. It didn’t matter, 
because Michigan couldn’t get 
the win.
“We understand the chal-

lenge that’s in front of us,” 
Brown said Sunday. “We’re 
confident in our ability. You’re 
not going to beat them one way. 
You’re going to have to play a 
number of different coverages. 
And we’re confident in our abil-
ity to do that.”
The sad part for Brown is 
that he was right to be confi-
dent. That performance, against 
one of the best 
offenses in the 
country, one that 
no team could 
stop, should 
have been good 
enough to carry 
the Wolverines 
to a signature 
victory.
Somehow, 
once again, it 
wasn’t.
Michigan was shut out in the 
second half. None of Patterson’s 
deep shots landed. The receiv-
ers had a case of the drops. Pat-
terson had a few costly sacks 
and an interception when he 
really needed to drive. And the 
final scoring margin made it 
seem like the Wolverines had 
given up too many points again.
“(Brown) was disappointed, 
all the time we put it and just 
as a defense, we know what we 
can do but we didn’t show it all 
today,” McGrone said. “So yeah, 
a little disappointment but 
that’s just what it is.”

McGrone knew his unit 
was capable of more, and 
said as much. That’s what all 
good competitors do. But the 
offense’s anemic performance 
required the defense to be 
perfect — and how could you 
expect it to be?
Alabama isn’t like Iowa or 
Wisconsin. This wasn’t ever 
going to be a traditional grind-
it-out Big Ten-
style game. The 
Crimson Tide 
were the third-
ranked offense 
in the country, 
per SP+. Michi-
gan was never 
going to win 
this game in the 
teens or 20s.
This was one 
of the defense’s 
best performances of the sea-
son against about as good of an 
opponent as you can get. The 
defense gave the offense every 
opportunity to seize a signature 
win. The offense couldn’t figure 
out how to take advantage.
But nobody’s going to 
remember how the defense did 
Wednesday, and they shouldn’t.
Because McGrone is right. It 
is what it is now — another bowl 
loss in a long string of them.

Michigan’s ‘D’ deserved better
Partridge to Ole Miss

Special teams coordinator 
and 
safeties 
coach 
Chris 
Partridge left the Michigan 
football 
program 
Thursday 
morning, taking a coaching 
position at Ole Miss under 
Lane Kiffin.
Though Partridge’s job title 
was not named in Ole Miss’ 
press release announcing the 
move, it’s widely expected that 
he will be named co-defensive 
coordinator with D.J. Durkin, 
another 
former 
Michigan 
assistant whose hiring the 
Rebels announced Thursday 
morning in a press release.
In Partridge, a former high 
school coach Jim Harbaugh 
hired from Paramus Catholic 
High School in New Jersey, 
the Wolverines lose their best 
recruiter on staff. Partridge 
won 
247Sports’ 
National 
Recruiter of the Year in 2017. 
He 
was 
instrumental 
in 
landing 
five-star 
defensive 
end Rashan Gary — the top-

rated player in the country at 
the time — and flipping five-
star safety Daxton Hill back to 
Michigan from Alabama last 
season. 
“I don’t really know where 
my head was at, at that time,” 
Hill said in October, describing 
his 
recruitment 
process. 
“That’s what happened right 
there.”
Having just finished his 
freshman season, Hill will 
be an instrumental part of 
Michigan’s 
defense 
moving 
forward. The Wolverines will 
have Partridge to thank for 
that. 
Harbaugh’s 
staff 
has 
undergone 
turnover 
every 
offseason. It took less than 24 
hours after Michigan’s season 
ended with a Citrus Bowl loss 
to Alabama this time around.
In 
terms 
of 
replacing 
Partridge, the Wolverines have 
an experienced safeties coach 
in Devin Bush Sr. already on 
staff. They could look there, or 
to an outside hire.

On Saturday afternoon, junior 
receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones 
declared for the NFL Draft, 
electing to forgo his final season 
of eligibility.
It’s the second blow in as many 
days for Michigan’s offense, after 
junior center Cesar Ruiz declared 
for the draft on Friday. Peoples-
Jones’ 
departure 
leaves 
the 
Wolverines without one of their 
top offensive weapons heading 
into 2020. Junior receiver Nico 
Collins has yet to make a decision.
“Coach Harbaugh and the 
University of Michigan have 
provided me with an exceptional 
college experience and I deeply 
value the relationships that I 
forged throughout my time in 
Ann Arbor,” Peoples-Jones said in 
a tweet Saturday. “… After much 
prayer and discussion, I have 
decided to forgo my senior season 
and will enter the 2020 draft! 
This has always been a lifelong 
dream of mine and I am excited 
for the new opportunities in store 
for me. God bless and Go Blue!”
Peoples-Jones arrived in Ann 
Arbor three years ago as one of 
the most heralded signings of the 
Jim Harbaugh era. He came in 
as a five-star recruit and the top-
ranked receiver in the 2017 class.
For the next three seasons, 
though, those skills were only 
sporadically 
on 
display. 
His 
79-yard 
touchdown 
against 
Michigan State in 2018 stands 
out as one of the most memorable 
moments in the Wolverines’ 
recent history.
However, Peoples-Jones finishes 
his Michigan career with just 
103 receptions for 1327 yards and 
14 touchdowns. In 2019, he was 
the 
Wolverines’ 
third-leading 
receiver with 438 yards and six 
touchdowns.
Still, the speed and raw talent 
that made him a top-15 recruit 
also have him projected as a 
probable Day Two NFL Draft 
pick. In his absence, Michigan 
will likely turn to sophomore 
receivers Mike Sainristil, Giles 
Jackson and Cornelius Johnson 
to take over larger roles in the 
offense and replace Peoples-
Jones’ 34 receptions.

Collins to stay, Peoples-Jones to go

One 
day 
after 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
declared 
for 
the NFL draft, junior receiver 
Nico 
Collins 
announced 
he 
will return to Michigan for his 
senior season.
Collins 
arrived 
in 
Ann 
Arbor 
as 
the 
third-
highest 
ranked 
wide 
receiver 
commit in the 
Wolverines’ 
star-studded 
2017 
recruiting 
class, but quickly 
established 
himself 
as 
one 
of 
their 
key offensive weapons. After 
catching just three passes as 
a freshman, Collins broke out 
as a sophomore, recording 38 
catches for 632 yards.
In 2019, he was Michigan’s 
second-leading 
receiver 
with 
729 
yards 
and 
seven 
touchdowns. His strong season 
was capped with a 165-yard, 
three-touchdown performance 
against Indiana in November, 
creating widespread belief that 
he would declare for the NFL 
Draft, where he was projected 
as a likely Day Two pick.
Collins’ 
return, 
though, 

should bolster the Wolverines’ 
receiving corps into one of 
the strengths of their offense 
heading into the 2020 season.
“I am excited to announce 
that with the support of my 
family, I will be returning to 
the University of Michigan for 
my senior year,” Collins said in 
a tweet Sunday 
afternoon. 
“I 
am taking this 
opportunity 
to 
progressively 
evolve my craft, 
in 
preparation 
for what God had 
in store for me!
“I have always 
believed 
in 
finishing 
what 
I started. Coach 
(Jim) Harbaugh, 
coach (Josh) Gattis and staff 
have helped me grow as a player 
and person. Another season 
with our coaching staff will 
allow me to continue to work on 
my skill and development which 
will prepare me for the next 
level.”
He 
is 
expected 
to 
join 
sophomore Ronnie Bell and 
freshman 
Giles 
Jackson 
as 
Michigan’s starting receivers. 
Along with the return of redshirt 
junior tight end Nick Eubanks, 
that group will likely account for 
the majority of the Wolverines’ 
receiving production in 2020.

Harbaugh sees bowl chance slip away

ORLANDO, 
Fla. 
— 
Jim 
Harbaugh gathered his team 
together at halftime with a 
simple message: Finish the way 
the way you want to finish.
For a month, the widespread 
expectation for Wednesday’s 
Citrus Bowl was a blowout. 
Even in a down year for 
Alabama, the Crimson Tide 
are still college football’s flag 
bearer, providing a measuring 
stick for any program — like 
Michigan — hoping to join the 
nation’s elite.
Yet, with 30 minutes to play, 
the Wolverines held a two-
point lead. Thirty minutes 
from the type of win that could 
re-define 
a 
season. 
Thirty 
minutes from the type of win 
nobody in that locker room had 
ever experienced.
So Harbaugh directed his 
message at the seniors.
“I know personally, I wanted 
to get that win for the seniors,” 
sophomore 
linebacker 
Cam 
McGrone said, echoing his 
coach’s message. “Cause this is 
their last time playing a game.”
With one half to play in their 
college careers, they had lost in 
all four of their games against 
Ohio State and all three of their 
bowl tries. But here in Orlando, 
Harbaugh told them, there 
was an opportunity to put that 
behind them and grab a victory 
that would stand alone in their 
careers.
It’s true for the seniors.
It’s also true for Harbaugh.
Hailed as Michigan’s savior 
when he arrived five years 
ago, he’s now lost the last two 
games of the season four years 
in a row. Since the Wolverines’ 
five-win improvement in his 
first year, the theme of his 
tenure has been stagnation. 
In that first season, he won 10 
games. Half a decade later, he’s 
still never won 11.
All of that has been repeated 
ad nauseum, just with the 
numbers 
being 
updated 
annually.
But on Wednesday, it felt 
more glaringly obvious than 
ever. Because on the other 

sideline stood Alabama, which 
did win 11 games this year. The 
Crimson Tide viewed it as a 
disappointment.
Harbaugh on his nine wins? 
“I feel good about (the future of 
our program). I feel good about 
some of the young players that 
got 
great 
experiences 
this 
season and, you know, them 
getting 
their 
opportunity, 
going to work on that.”
Losing to Alabama shouldn’t 
deter that. The Wolverines 
held the Crimson Tide to 
their 
lowest 
point total of 
the season in 
a 
far-from-
embarrassing 
35-16 loss.
But it does 
provide 
a 
glimpse at the 
opportunity 
Michigan, and 
Harbaugh, 
let 
slip away.
“It just builds off going into 
next year,” Alabama cornerback 
Patrick Surtain said. “Like I 
said, we needed this game. Just 
a key moment going into next 
year. It’s a point of emphasis, 
going into next year with a high 
head on our shoulders.”
That’s 
for 
Alabama, 
a 
program whose expectation 
next year will be a national 
championship. The Crimson 
Tide, 
though, 
understand 
that getting there starts now, 
where a win will propel them 
into an offseason filled with 
confidence and optimism.
Michigan 
understands 

that too. Tuesday morning, 
Harbaugh called the Citrus 
Bowl, “a great opportunity 
for our season, for this 2019 
season.”
The 
difference 
for 
the 
Wolverines is they couldn’t 
take 
advantage. 
So 
while 
Alabama enters the offseason 
with 2019 marking a mere blip 
on their radar, Michigan enters 
theirs with no more answers 
than it had a year ago.
It’s why, as the clock ticked 
toward zeroes late afternoon, 
Harbaugh paced 
the 
Michigan 
sideline 
in 
a 
familiar 
pose: 
hands on hips, 
eyes 
trained 
toward 
the 
ground.
A 
few 
moments 
after 
Harbaugh 
had 
walked 
down 
the 
tunnel, 
towards a familiarly uncertain 
offseason, his counterpart — 
Alabama coach Nick Saban 
— cracked a smile and tossed 
a few celebratory oranges out 
of the Citrus Bowl trophy and 
toward his adoring players.
“I think that there was a lot 
of value for our program and 
our team to be able to come 
and get a reward, first of all, 
for having a successful season,” 
Saban said. “I know most 
people would think that 10-2 
was a good season. That’s not 
necessarily our standard.”
For 
Harbaugh 
and 
the 
Wolverines, it is. In a good year.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | JANUARY 8, 2020

I thought I’d aged out of this years ago. I’m sitting criss-cross-applesauce in my apartment while my roommate 
straightens my hair. The brush catches my hair knots and pulls my head back like the boys in my elementary 
school used to do, though it wasn’t because they liked me. 
The hair situation isn’t going as planned. My curls are beginning to spring back from stress sweat, either caused 
by the fact that I’m going to a dance with a stranger or the fear that I won’t fit in with the crowd. I have less than 
20 minutes to figure out how I can turn my curly hair, acne and glasses into something remotely resembling a 

O

n a Monday night in Novem-
ber, I sat on my half-lofted 
dorm bed with a book. It was 
already 2 a.m. My roommate was sleep-
ing on the other side of the room, and 
I’d carefully angled my desk lamp away 
from her so I could continue reading 
without disturbing her. 
Most weeknights, 2 a.m. is an hour 
I only experience if I’m staying up to 
study. But that night, I wasn’t reading 
for class — I was reading a novel.
Outside our window, I saw a few 
students walking back from the direc-
tion of the Diag with backpacks on 
— I assumed they were coming from 
Hatcher or the UGLi. A couple of my 
friends were studying in the lobby of 
my dorm building some floors below. As 
I lay there, I wondered: How many oth-
ers were reading this late because they 
really wanted to read? How many of us 
even read for leisure anymore? 
When I was younger, I devoured sto-
ries. I was the type of kid who would 

say goodnight to her parents with a 
book and a flashlight under her pil-
low. I always kept a novel tucked into 
one of the pockets of my middle school 
backpack, in case I wanted to read dur-
ing recess. I remember spending many 
Saturday afternoons with my dad at 
Barnes & Noble in the children’s litera-
ture section — a magical world.
In high school, I stopped seeing the 
magic in reading, as did many of my 
peers. Instead, the majority of my free 
time was dedicated to homework. If I 
wasn’t doing homework, I was probably 
on my way to tennis practice, orches-
tra rehearsal or club meetings. There 
just wasn’t any time to read for fun, 
and I had enough assigned reading on 
my plate between “Romeo and Juliet,” 
“The Grapes of Wrath” and “Franken-
stein.” Deadlines and forced fishbowl 
discussions in English class made read-
ing a chore rather than a joy. 
It wasn’t until this past summer 
when I was finally relieved of the chore 

of reading. I was stuck in a weird limbo 
between an ending and a beginning, and 
for the first time in a long while, I had 
no obligations. It was a slow, strange 
summer, placed awkwardly between 
my graduation from high school and 
the start of my first semester of college. 
I had no summer Chemistry packets to 
solve, English books to read or History 
essays to write.
Thus, I read. In the muggy heat, I 
went to Schuler Books, my local book-
store, and explored the expanse of 
shelves. Eventually, I emerged with 
an ambitious pile of books in my arms, 
and then I read and read and read. 
Upon witnessing this, one of my friends 
laughed and told me I was making up 
for the last four years. 
Looking back now, I wish I had real-
ized how precious that time was. Now 
that it’s winter in Ann Arbor, my life is 
nothing like it was back then. Summer 
is long gone — now, it’s cold and bleak 
out, and everything – from classes, 

friends, applications, orgs and meet-
ings – is chaotic once again. I am here 
to get an education, but college life 
can feel like endless work, work, work. 
There always seems to be a constant 
need to be doing something. At times, 
it feels suffocating. 
On a whim this fall semester, I 
ordered a novel online. It would be a 
break from everything, I decided, and 
maybe it would help make things less 
chaotic. Maybe I could recreate my 
lazy days from last summer. When the 
package arrived, I practically ripped 
the box apart. I held the book in my 
hands. It was new, in hardcover: “The 
Starless Sea,” by Erin Morgenstern. 
With its black binding and ornate gold 
engravings along its cover and spine, it 
reminded me of those books I’d poured 
over when I was younger, the ones with 
rough edged paper and maps of fantasy 
worlds. Despite my initial excitement, 
it took me awhile to find time to actu-
ally sit down and read it: I ended up 
carrying the book around in my back-
pack for a few days on the chance I’d 
find myself free.
The spare moment I’d been waiting 
for finally came on a Monday night in 
November. One of my weekly meetings 
had been canceled on short notice, I’d 
finished most of my homework and the 
next day was a light class schedule for 
me — the universe seemed to be on my 
side.
So, I sat down on my bed, nestled 
into the various blankets I’d brought 
from home, and laid “The Starless Sea” 
across my lap. I let myself sink into the 
pages. Before I knew it, it was two in 
the morning and I was halfway through 
the book. 
By now, I’ve finished “The Starless 
Sea.” It’s still sitting on my desk next 
to my bed, underneath a growing pile 
of secondhand books I’ve bought from 
Dawn Treader. If I sit in my bed and 
read at just the right angle, I can see the 
gold of the book’s spine glinting under 
the light of my lamp. It serves as a con-
stant reminder of that Monday night — 
and the natural magic behind reading 
that I almost forgot.

D

uring the winter holidays, Augie’s Coffee 
Roasters 
of 
Claremont, 
California 
is 
overflowing with recent college graduates 
reuniting, families stopping for a moment with babies 
in strollers and young couples chatting over matcha, 
oat milk lattes. The customers spill out to the tables of 
the Packing House, a relic of the ancient Californian 
citrus empire that’s been repurposed into a village 
attraction, complete with artists’ lofts and a used 
bookstore. 
It’s a joyous scene — a busy one — and a testament 
to a downtown that’s really come into itself over 
the past decade. Claremont, my hometown, is a city 
superficially similar to Ann Arbor, in terms of coffee 
shop offerings and deliberately cultivated, upper-
middle class quirk. After all, all happy college towns 
are alike.
I found myself at Augie’s not to meet old high 
school friends or catch up with extended family, 
but rather to seek out a small bit of normalcy in the 
strange, boneless time of year that is winter break as 
a college student. After a semester of a meticulously 
scheduled Google Calendar, a planner overflowing 
with deadlines and overly-optimistic aspirations, 
friends’ birthday parties and Rick’s Thursdays, 
moving back into my mom’s house for a few weeks 
tends to feel weird, for lack of a better word. The 
structure I’ve built around myself in Ann Arbor 
dissipates, and there’s the constant, uneasy feeling 
of falling backwards in time, the hovering fear that 
without a booked schedule and my college friends 
around me, I’ll revert back to my 17-year-old self — a 
terrifying prospect.
Coffee shops, however, are familiar territory. 
Having spent the majority of the past three and 
half years buying overpriced coffee with most of 
my minimal income, using the flimsy justification 
that the caffeine will power me through the essay of 
the moment, I know my way around these spaces. I 
know how to be myself — the college-aged version of 
myself, that is — in coffee shops, whether they are in 
Michigan or California.
So, I swapped out my living room couch for Augie’s, 
and set up shop with my book of the moment — 
“Commonwealth” by Ann Patchett — at a wobbly 
table in the interior of the Packing House, adjacent to 
Augie’s storefront.
Surrounded by the chaos of happy reunifications, I 
was particularly conscious of my solitude. So, my relief 
was palpable when I made the discovery that I had a 
lone comrade in my reading pursuits — a blonde boy 
sitting diagonal from me, buried in an unidentifiable 
paperback. He seemed utterly undisturbed by the 
goings-on around him, absorbed in some alternate 
world in the pages of his beat-up novel.
We were sitting facing each other, yet at a safe 
enough distance that I managed to sneak glances in 
his direction, intrigued by my fellow reader. What 
was he so engrossed in? Did he also feel self-conscious 
at sitting alone while laughter rang around us?
I pulled out my phone to check Instagram and 
was immediately ashamed of myself — my reading 
companion would surely never be so superficial as 
to put aside his literature for the banality of social 
media. Several minutes later, however, I caught 
him setting down his book spine-up on the table to 
scroll through his phone for a few minutes, and was 
reassured. We were kindred souls, I reasoned: both 

big fans of reading and good literature, yet not so 
self-righteous that we were above the distractions of 
social networks. He got me, I got him. 
My companion had to be somewhere in my age 
range, had the look of an older college student or 
recent grad and seemed like someone also trying to 
get some breathing space from his family over the 
holidays. He was blonde and clean-cut, so I figured 
he was either an economics major or beginning his 
studies at dental school. Not the most breathtakingly 
handsome man I’d ever seen, but definitely workable 
material. We’d get along, I speculated, and though we 
probably wouldn’t have the same music taste, I could 
see him wanting to talk about politics or check out 
new independent films. He’d get along great with my 
dad.
For an hour, we sat as such, me buried in 
“Commonwealth,” and him in his respective reading 
pursuit. Customers came and went — a loud woman 
with neck tattoos vacated the table to my left in favor 
of a young father, whose toddling offspring attached 
herself to any and all passersby. I smiled, and out of 
the corner of my eye, caught him smiling at the same 
moment.
Suddenly, there came the worst possible betrayal 
— I looked up from a particularly engrossing chapter 
to realize that my companion had vanished, leaving 
behind an empty chair and table. The dad and child 
were still to my left, as were the loud, grad students 
behind me, but his place was undeniably vacant.
What disloyalty! Such treachery! We’d built a future 
together in the hour that had passed in Augie’s — and 
this boy had the nerve to throw it all to the wind!
Only now sitting truly alone and feeling quite 

jilted — but also rather amused — at my evaporated 
fantasies, did I allow myself to float down to reality.
Sure, it was the idea of it. Of course, it was, it always 
is, right? The idea that buying a new top will fix all 
my problems, the idea of the perfect internship in 
a big city and the idea of the guy in the coffee shop. 
The ideas that always tend to turn out the same way 
— the top predictably ends up being just a top, the 
perfect internship inevitably ends up being at least 
80 percent busy work. The guy leaves the coffee shop 
before anything ever begins. 
It’s the idea that college has made me more 
educated, thoughtful and self-confident — worlds 
away from the insecure 17-year-old that frequented 
this same coffee shop four years — a lifetime —ago. 
The self who breezes through her hometown on short 
visits before moving on to bigger and better things. 
A self who has perfected herself in every possible 
aspect — overcome all her flaws, a self who no man 
would (ever) turn down — or even, god forbid, fail to 
approach in the neighborhood coffee shop.
I told myself he probably had awful breath. Or 
maybe he was studying finance and would have ended 
up to be one of those men who would advise me on my 
401k within the first few minutes of a conversation.
So caught up was I in my new justification that I 
almost missed the blond guy returning to his seat — 
he’d only gone for a coffee refill. 
We read together, sitting at our separate tables, for 
another two hours, before parting ways. This time, 
it was I who left first and who neglected to bid him 
farewell. I could have talked to him, I suppose, but 
what would have been the use of that? It was only ever 
just the idea of it.

The idea of it

ILLUSTRATION BY CHRISTINE JEGARL

I thought I’d aged out of this years ago. I’m sitting criss-cross-applesauce in my apartment while my roommate 
straightens my hair. The brush catches my hair knots and pulls my head back like the boys in my elementary 
school used to do, though it wasn’t because they liked me. 
The hair situation isn’t going as planned. My curls are beginning to spring back from stress sweat, either caused 
by the fact that I’m going to a dance with a stranger or the fear that I won’t fit in with the crowd. I have less than 
20 minutes to figure out how I can turn my curly hair, acne and glasses into something remotely resembling a 


E

njoy your meal!” said the waiter.
“You too!” I responded thoughtlessly.
The dialogue which shapes our lives is often 
a fumble. We stutter, misspeak, offend, reveal too much 
or not enough. Once we say what we do, it cannot be 
unsaid. In a technological world, what we type is forever 
imprinted somewhere. Contemporary “cancel culture” 
ensures that what we say and write is not only permanent, 
but unforgivable. Similarly, what is unsaid in one moment 
can remain forever unsaid, and the chances we don’t take 
in speech or otherwise are rarely offered to us for an 
opportunity to do-over. 
This phenomenon, and perhaps its pressure, was one 
reason I was drawn to playwriting. Drafting the dialogue 
of drama allowed me to control speech and situation, 
making the uncertainty of reality anticipatory. The first 
piece I wrote for the stage centered on this very notion, 
called “Backspace,” my quasi-one act play had a plot 
driven by the nonexistence of a backspace key on the 
typewriter used to write our lives. Without the power to 
return in time and in text, everything, once written, could 
not be rewritten. In the end, the characters confronted 
the one-directional passage of time and developed skills 
of apology and forgiveness to progress through their 
stories. There are ways to move forward in a life marked 
with errors, as we have all been forced to do, but moving 
on does not always eradicate missed opportunities from 

our memory. 
Playwriting is attractive as a medium in part because 
the dialogue I write can achieve anything I choose. With 
that power, I can say the right thing, offer forgiveness, 
give depth to the unknown and resolve conflict.
Still, the stage attempts to proxy reality, and as such, 
does not show perfectly smooth speech. Certainly, 
there would be no purpose in drama which was gutless 
or without despair, but the truth lived on stage is a 
manufactured one in which the desired ending is reached 
regardless of contextual complexity. The act of writing a 
drama, and not simply living one, gives me a semblance 
of control.
Living, however, has provided me ample opportunity 
to misspeak. One of my most serious errors in dialogue 
happened when, as an adolescent, I took it upon myself to 
criticize the life choices of a sister’s friend through the self-
righteous gossiping in which I had learned to participate. 
After at least 30 long minutes critically disparaging her 
grades, friends and clothes at a slumber party, I was 
shocked to find out she had been eavesdropping from my 
sister’s room next-door and overheard all of the unkind 
things my friends and I said. In the tense period after the 
interaction, I took to writing the drama as I wished the 
reality had unfolded. In one version, my friends and I had 
complimented her, and she became confident and joyful. 
In another, she did not cry outside the door but instead 

laughed, taking our words as facetious and offering us 
easy forgiveness.
In reality, my 12-year-old self apologized profusely 
after a period of embarrassment-induced blame I threw at 
my sister and her friend for sneakily listening in. I could 
not undo what I had said, but I tried to offer a revision. 
Fortunately for me, she and I remain friends today, since 
she accepted my apology. But this outcome was not 
guaranteed, and on other occasions, these accidental 
unkindnesses and offenses in dialogue have had lasting 
consequences. Sometimes, we have to write forgiveness 
into the story ourselves.
Dialogue is instrumental to the unfolding of our lives. 
How many times have the trajectories of our lives been 
decidedly altered when we were brave enough to greet a 
new friend, impress the right executive or defend what 
we stand for? How many times have we failed to speak 
and so cannot know what could have been? There is a 
profound ache that comes with the regret and anguish of 
life paths not taken and the torture of wonderment they 
stir in us. 
What if I had just said “yes,” or “no,” or something at 
all? 
I have not been unscathed by the force of regret for the 
unsaid. One particular fate-induced meeting still stands 
out as a catalyst for longing. 
One night, while I was solo-traveling in Stockholm, 

I found myself stranded eight miles from my residence 
— I had been living in Iceland and forgot the sun sets 
during the night in other parts of the world. Without 
a phone or cash, I wasn’t sure how I’d hail a ride back 
across the city’s isles, but that summer I had adopted the 
Icelandic mantra, “Þetta reddast,” or “it will fix itself,” 
so I remained unconcerned. I saw a boy my age walking 
the same direction as me — using his obviously-charged 
phone — which seemed like the logical way out of my 
situation. Conveniently, he had called an Uber to the 
same district that I was staying, and I shared the ride 
with him through the city. 
On the 40-minute journey through the night, we 
talked through multitudes of the political and personal, 
finding fateful linkages of days we’d both been in the 
same capital cities, interests we shared and beliefs we 
both found inalienable. When he implored me to stay up 
through the night, to explore the posh district and race 
against the sun’s rising, I fumbled for words and landed 
on non-adventure. 
The next morning my instinct of making things right — 
or rather, rewriting the regret — set in. As I took a train 
to Oslo, I wrote the dialogue I remembered and altered 
the ending, subtitling it, “with the grace of hindsight.” 
What might have happened that night if I said yes? The 
question would weigh on me for weeks.
Most people can name a time they wanted a do-over, 

and writing for the theatre gives us a 
chance to create one. This past summer 
I co-directed playwriting workshops in 
Kosovo, and we drew on this desire for 
rewriting the personal to make peace 
with past things said and unsaid. We 
created an activity called “Goodbye 
Stranger” for our final week, where 
students were to think of an encounter 
with someone they saw once and then 
never again. They could write the interaction with any 
ending they desired. 
One student wrote of the last time she saw a former 
crush, when she wanted to accept his apology for the 
hurtful things he said. When she performed the piece 
with the dialogue she wished she had actually used, 
her voice was brave and pure. She showed me that it is 
redemptive to forgive. 
Another student rewrote an interaction she had with 
an aggressor on public transit, who threatened her with 
stares and catcalls. She reimagined the scene as one in 
which she defended herself and the women around her 
from his taunting. She showed me that it is redemptive 
to empower. 
Another wrote of the interpersonal depth she thought 
existed within her favorite celebrity, who she had seen 
once on the street. Her scene detailed his hardships 

and hopes, reminding us what we might miss when we 
take someone’s surface as their entirety. She showed me 
that it is redemptive to inquire. Making things right or 
deep or new by rewriting moments missed is a process of 
redemption and one of reclamation.
I keep writing dialogue to put the world back in order 
— to forgive myself and others, reimagine lost time and 
put an end to conflict. On the page and on the stage, the 
progression of things is in my control. It would be nice if, 
in the writing in times of war, we ended it, or in recovering 
time spent we had second chances to muster bravery. In 
fictive worlds, we can imagine these better outcomes 
and actualize them when we choose. This process is not 
as imaginary as it seems. After all, in being reminded of 
the worlds I wish to inhabit, it becomes easier to set out 
creating them.

A little faith

I

n the August before my junior year, I scrambled to 
rearrange my schedule. I cold-emailed professors, 
begging them to let me into their classes and hopping 
on the waitlist of any possible course. Then I came across 
one called “The Catholic Novel.” The course description 
read: “All are welcome: religious, agnostic, atheist, non-
Christian, just reading, Catholic curious, and ‘questioning.’” 
I considered myself Catholic-curious, but it came as a 
surprise that I could enroll despite being sort-of-Jewish and 
maybe-atheist. On the first day of fall classes, I found myself 
in English 473 with an assignment to attend Mass three 
separate times. I was eager to see what this 2,000-year-old 
commotion was all about.
My first Mass visit was in the basement of St. Mary Student 
Parish on a Wednesday afternoon. The parish sits on the 
corner of William and Thompson, just across the street from 
NeoPapalis. I’d passed it a dozen times and never noticed 
it before. I locked my bike up, crossed the street nervously 
and walked into the dim, air-conditioned building. It was a 
sunny day, but the basement was quiet and still. 
The second I sat down, a woman breathlessly approached 
me. “Would you like to be the reader?” she said. 
Maybe I looked like I needed saving. “The what?” 
“The reader,” she repeated.
“Oh, thank you, but this is my first time at Mass so I 
probably shoul-”
“No, it’s easy. You can do it. You’ll do it. Want to do it?”
I reluctantly agreed. Rapidly and without taking a breath, 
she explained my task. I started to feel like a bit of an 
impostor, so I jutted in:
“I’m not Catholic.”
“Oh,” she said, clearly caught off guard. “Are you 
Christian?”
“No.”
“Hm. Are you Baptized?”
“No.”
“Well, are you Jewish?”
“Yes.”
“Okay, let me think.” She proceeded to think for no more 
than one full second. “That’s fine. Same God. Old Testament. 
It’s fine by me. We won’t tell anyone. It’s probably fine. It’s 
alright.”
She took me to the lectern to show me the book I’d read 
from and finally introduced herself as Rainey. She told me 
she’d give me a nod when it was time. I returned to my pew, 
more nervous than I ever anticipated being on a Wednesday 
afternoon visit to Mass.
A priest walked onto the pulpit. He murmured some hellos 
and maybe a prayer — I wasn’t really listening, distracted 

by my imminent Church debut. When he finished, Rainey 
suddenly turned around. She looked at me and nodded. 
A-freaking-men, I thought, here goes nothing.
I walked past the seemingly-endless rows of pews and 
stood facing the pulpit like everyone else still in their seats. 
Five minutes before, Rainey told me, “When you get to that 
part, do not bow to the tabernacle, the crucifix or the Virgin 
Mary. Find a place where God rests for you. He cannot rest in 
any of these places for you since you are not a Catholic, but he 
rests somewhere, just think of him for a moment.”
Remembering Rainey’s instructions, I stood stiff and 
clammy-palmed, careful not to bow. I closed my eyes, but 
instead of thinking about God, I wondered how long I was 
supposed to stand there. 
When it seemed like a sufficient amount of time had 
passed for thinking about where God rested, I found my 
place behind the lectern and peered at the book. All the 
rapid instructions Rainey gave me minutes before swirled 
in my mind. Read only the black words, she said; I read 
only the black words. Pause at this part and raise your 
arm; I paused at that part and raised my arm. Everyone 
repeated something with me. It went on like this for a few 
minutes and then I was finished. I stepped back, closed 
my eyes and bowed my head for about as long as seemed 
appropriate.
Rainey smiled at me as I returned to my seat. 
The Mass continued with a short homily, various 
prayers and ample kneeling. I crossed my arms and 
did not receive communion like a good non-Catholic. 
It all went by as one would expect, but when the priest 
asked for anyone to share grievances or prayers, I was 
surprised when Rainey piped up, “May all the children 
of the Abrahamic religions know that they are loved by 
God, our God, one God,” she said. “That they shall feel 
and know His love and that they shall know that we are 
all united in God’s eyes.”
As she spoke, I looked around at all the heads bent in 
prayer. Instead of making me feel like some kind of strange 
religious voyeur stealthily observing Catholic rituals, 
Rainey’s words reminded me I was just another person at 
church on a warm Wednesday afternoon. I laced my fingers 
together, bowed my head and closed my eyes like everyone 
else — if someone had come into the chapel at that moment, 
they wouldn’t have been able to tell the difference.
For my second Mass, I was at St. Mary again: same 
basement, different day, different priest. When I went up 
during communion at my previous Mass visit, I had looked 
down into the hands of the other priest, but I looked this one 
directly in the face. My crossed arms interrupted the flow of 

his communion. Ready to present the Eucharist, he tripped 
over his words as he noticed my closed-off body. He looked 
me in the eyes, leveled his face with mine, put his hand on my 
shoulder and said in a kind voice, “May peace be with you all 
your days.” It was a comfort I never knew I was missing — like 
the comfort I’d experienced after Rainey’s prayer. I felt a sense 
of belonging and peace, even in the basement of an unfamiliar 
building with little light and few faces I had seen before.
On another Sunday morning at Mass, a priest at St. 
Thomas the Apostle Church looked over my head to the line 
of communion-takers behind me, made a Sign of the Cross 
with the wafer, then waved me aside. It felt like hundreds 
of pairs of eyes bored into me as I walked back to my seat, 
seeing me for what I was: an outsider, a fake, unable to take 
communion.
Soon after, the priest and altar servers left the chapel in a 
procession carrying the crucifix down the aisle, with their 
green, gold, white and black robes drifting behind them. I 
watched them pass by as the organ played in the background. 
Once the fanfare ended, the woman who had been sitting 
next to me with her granddaughter turned to me. “I hope 
your day is full,” she said, then left.
I smiled. It almost seemed like she knew how I was 
feeling. Something inside me stirred quietly again, then 
settled. I walked out of the church alongside those who now 
felt a little less like strangers and into the cold, gray morning. 
Maybe God was trying to tell me something on these 
occasions: That there is mutual friendship or love to be 
shared with Him, or that there is a universal vision of 
grace, and Catholicism is the center of it. Maybe He was 
trying to show me that there are infinite ways to be good to 
other people. I cannot fully know His intentions — or know 
whether I believe He exists at all — but I was received with 
what felt like love by someone at each Mass I attended. 
And if any laws are regularly broken in life, they are those 
of human solidarity, social charity and love — laws on 
which Christianity is built. It was good to see these virtues 
actually in practice during my three Mass visits — good to be 
reminded they exist at all.
I don’t plan to start praying every night, confess my sins or 
convert to Catholicism, but I may return to Mass even after 
those three required visits. And if my return is not for the 
grace of Christ, then it will be for the wide and open ceilings 
of the churches and the way hymns filter through their 
stained-glass windows like rays of light through water.
And religious beliefs aside, those three Masses and the 
people I encountered at them made me pause and reflect. 
I was an outsider; I never knew the prayers, I didn’t know 
when to kneel or stand up and I never made the Sign of the 
Cross. But I was not treated as a stranger, or an intruder or 
even a visitor — just as another person at a church trying 
to make sense of why we are here on this earth. At a time 
in my life where I feel the constant pressure to compete 
with thousands of strangers who are smarter than me, 
more qualified than me or more driven than me, going to 
those churches and experiencing something so unfamiliar 
came as a relief I hadn’t expected. Not one of us is any less 
worthy than another of the love, kindness and friendship 
we encounter in this life. Mass reminded me of this — it 
reminded me that whatever it is we are doing on this earth, 
we cannot forget that we are doing it together, that we are 
beings bound together by history, time and even by which 
pew we decide to sit in when we go to church. 
Whatever is up there, around us or below, there is 
something to be said for quietly sitting beside another person 
for a while, for taking a stranger’s hand and wishing them 
peace for the day and for singing, standing and kneeling as 
one. Even if our prayers are not heard by God, I think it’s 
alright — we can be sure they are heard by those around us. 
There is comfort in being side-by-side as we bend towards 
heaven.

I 

thought I’d aged out of this years ago. 
I’m sitting criss-cross applesauce in 
my apartment while my roommate 
straightens my hair. The brush catches my 
hair knots and pulls my head back like the 
boys in my elementary school used to do, 
though it wasn’t because they liked me. 
The hair situation isn’t going as planned. 
My curls are beginning to spring back from 
stress sweat, caused by either the fact that I’m 
going to a dance with a stranger or the fear 
that I won’t fit in with the crowd. I have less 
than 20 minutes to figure out how I can turn 
my curly hair, acne and glasses into something 
remotely resembling a sorority girl.
“Do you want me try straightening it 
again?” my roommate asks.
“Who even cares anymore?” I yell and look 
at myself in the mirror, which I’ve smudged so 
I have a barrier between myself and my reflec-
tion. I wish I’d just left my hair curly but don’t 
have time to fix it. I swallow my inferiority com-
plex and call an Uber to the fraternity house.
Part of my anxiety comes from the fact that 
I wasn’t technically asked to this date party. It 
was more of an indirect invite, like in middle 
school when a friend asked my crush out on 
my behalf without asking for permission (he 
said no). My other roommate had been invit-
ed to the date party and wanted to set me up 
with another fraternity brother so we could 
go together. I said yes as long as she promised 
not to bail on me. Less than two days later, she 
backed out.
I could’ve backed out, too, but somehow felt 
obligated to keep my promise. Maybe it was 
out of compliance to the popularity gods, or an 
attempt to redefine my status as an awkward 
art girl. Maybe I was just curious to see if I 
could fit in with Greek life for a night. 

I arrive at the house, an ex-mansion van-
dalized with large Greek letters. I stand 
outside the front doors like a child waiting 
for their play date. The doors open to reveal 
my date, a tall and handsome figure with 
curly blonde hair that makes me feel silly for 
straightening mine. He invites me inside and 
we pass a DJ hyping up five people dancing. I 
try not to think about how much money was 
spent on this event. 
A girl poses in the living room, her back 
arched and eyes averted from her boyfriend 
snapping photos. A crowd cheers her on as 
she contorts her body into extreme shapes to 
accentuate her curves. She’s clearly done this 
before.
We pass a few more girls, all of whom are 
wearing similar outfits as me but are taller 
and with clearer skin. I feel like I’m in fifth 
grade and the prettiest girl in class is sitting 
next to me wearing the same Aeropostale 
shirt. I am a lab experiment: If we keep outfit 
X constant, it will yield significant results in 
measuring beauty, Y.
My date and I enter a room away from the 
noise and start getting to know each other. 
We have more in common than I previously 
thought: an interest in the Myers-Briggs test, 
a lack of interest in Greek life (ironic consid-
ering he’s a frat brother) and an equal hatred 
of the grading system. I wonder if this night 
could actually turn out well.
Our party bus arrives and we’re met with a 
cloud of bubblegum nicotine inside. I’m intro-
duced to two identical girls sitting across from 
us, whose names I immediately forget.
“Super cute glasses, don’t feel self con-
scious about them!” the one on the left tells me 
before I can say anything. I grimace.
Once the bus starts to move, the cabin goes 

dark and blasts EDM 
music. Strobe lights 
signal the passen-
gers to slowly rise 
from their seats like 
zombies and I watch 
in horror as they col-
lectively grind on 
each other in freeze 
frames. Their faces 
are 
dead, 
drunk, 
their bodies moving 
out of obligation to 
the night. I wonder 
if there’s a full moon 
outside.
The club is packed 
with the same scene. 
Distant faces, some-
where 
between 
bored and aroused, 
are attached to loose 
bodies touching each 
other with a sense of 
urgency. Again, the 
DJ seems to be hav-
ing the most fun of 
anyone.
My date asks a girl to take a photo of us. I 
feel like Nick Carraway next to Gatsby, a fan 
meeting her celebrity crush. The flash goes off 
and I place my hand awkwardly on his stom-
ach. I imagine my acne scars lit up under the 
light, spelling out “she shouldn’t be here” in 
Braille. I don’t look at the photo.
I head to the bathroom and face a chorus of 
yelling that someone cut in line, sobbing com-
ing from the corner and three occupied stalls 
with girls vomiting. The floor is more toilet 
paper than it is tile. One girl stands at the sink 
posting an Instagram photo. 
I wonder if all the girls in the bathroom 
were once posed like the model I saw in the 
frat house. Maybe this is the only place they 
can escape the feeling of being watched, the 
one place where they don’t perform. 
I wait as dozens of girls cut in front of me in 
line, letting them pass without a word.
I

t’s become instinct for me to assume 
attractive people are better than me. I 
find myself listening to their presenta-
tions more closely, following their Instagram 
even if I don’t know or care about them and 
feeling envious of their new job even if it’s at 
an obscure consulting firm. But the more I’m 
in spaces with these people, it makes me won-
der what “attractive” actually means – does 
it mean being tall and impossibly fit? Does it 
mean attending Pure Barre classes twice a 
week? Or does it just mean looking the exact 
same as everyone else?
As I look around the bathroom, I not only 
realize I’m freed from being watched, but I 
was never being watched in the first place. 
The girls walking past me in line don’t even 
give me a second glance. I could have skipped 
the hour before the party I spent staring at 
myself in the mirror, my hair curly and frizzy 

with bangs sticking to my forehead. I could 
have skipped the makeup and let me acne 
scars glow. No one even cared that I was there 
– and neither did I.
After finally pushing my way through the 
bathroom crowd, my date takes me to Buffalo 
Wild Wings with his friend and his friend’s 
girlfriend. “Wheel of Fortune” plays on the 
waiting area TV. I watch Vanna White strut 
across the screen and wonder if she’s actually 
there to reveal the clue’s letters or just to boost 
the show’s ratings.
“Did you know Vanna White makes $8 mil-
lion a year?” I ask. “Just for being beautiful 
and walking across the screen?”
My date shrugs. “Sometimes that’s what 
pays.”
Our food finally arrives and as I bite into 
my chicken wing, my date’s mouth falls open. 
“We’re going to miss our bus.” Panic ensues; 
the friend starts swearing and the friend’s 
girlfriend sprints outside. Both of the guys 
chase after her. I take another bite of chicken 
and watch the scene unfold, amused.
The girlfriend finds the bus and screams 
at the driver to let us inside, pounding on the 
door and threatening him. He complies. The 
rest of us apologize on her behalf. It turns out 
the Vanna Whites of the world really can get 
away with anything.
On the ride home, the bus fights over the 
rest of our chicken wings like fresh kill. My 
date stares out the window and says, without 
looking at me, “I’d give this night a five out of 
ten. It’s past my bedtime.”
I’m offended for a few seconds then realize 
there was never a version of this night where 
we would both have a good time. It takes a 
certain kind of person to enjoy these kinds 
of events, a collection of values and priorities 
that I simply don’t have. I remember my date 
said the same thing about himself. 
I finally ask the question I’ve been wonder-
ing all night: “If you don’t like Greek life, why 
are you in it?”
He shifts in his seat and says he doesn’t 
really know. “I guess I just like living in the 
house with the guys,” he says. I wonder why 
he joined in the first place but stay silent. 
Maybe he and “the guys” joined freshman 
year and just stuck with it without question; 
I probably would have done the same if my 
friends and this culture were intertwined. I’m 
immediately thankful they’re not.
The bus parks and someone hands me the 
empty box of chicken wings as if I’m their 
trash can. My date gives me a quick hug good-
bye and I call for a ride home.
I stumble into my apartment and look at 
myself in the mirror. My straight hair has 
started to curl and my makeup is almost 
entirely wiped off from walking in the cold. 
I start to see myself between smudges in the 
glass. For the first time, I’m glad to see my 
reflection looks like me.
I climb into bed, happy to take off my cos-
tume. It’s exhausting being invisible.
