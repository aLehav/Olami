NEGOTIATIONS
UMHS,
nurses
agree on
contract
Both sides have
been in discussions
since April
By STEVE ZOSKI
Daily Staff Reporter
After months of negotiations,
the University of Michigan Health
System and the Michigan Nurses
Association reached a tentative
contract agreement on Friday.
The MNA will meet at a date to be
determined to hold a ratification
vote.
Katie Oppenheim, chair of the
University of Michigan Profes-
sional Nurse Council, said spe-
cific details about the deal can't be
released yet, but more details will
be provided soon.
"We are unanimously recom-
mending ratification of this agree-
ment," Oppenheim said. "That is
all that we can say at this point.
Once we have the first ratification
meeting, we will post (the agree-
ment) on our website."
A UMHS spokesman declined
to comment on the new contract.
UMHS and the MNA have been
in negotiations since April and the
nurses have been working without
a contract since July. The main
controversy in the discussions
was centered on the nurses' com-
pensation and benefits.
The nurses claimed that UMHS'

TITLE IX TALK

Chicks don't dig the 'stache

60 years ago this week (Oct.
28,1951): Murray Kushell, execu-
tive vice-president of the Better
Grooming Foundation, reported
that college women admire mus-
taches. Kushell also stated that
one main reason for the rapid
increase in mustaches is that men
discovered that women secretly
admire being tickled when they
are kissed.
This assertion was flatly denied
by the women questioned at the
University, and most insisted that
they could not think of anything
worse than prickly facial hair.
"Heavens, no!" a University
senior replied when asked by
The Michigan Daily if she liked
"cookie dusters," or moustaches.
But she added that they weren't

bad on older men.
30 years ago this week (Oct.
30, 1971): Robert Knauss, vice
president for Student Services,
-requested more campus security,
when more than 1,400 residents
asked for improved service after
two rapes were reported on cam-
pus.
Knauss proposed the Dial-a-
Ride bus service for students as
well as an expansion ofthe regular
North Campus bus service area to
cover the Northwood Apartments.
Knauss also authorized
improved lighting on the streets
and the construction of a chain
link fence along the edge of the
Nichols Arboretum, in addition
to increased patrols by the Uni-
versity security guards.

10 years ago this week (Oct.
23, 2001): A joint committee of
the Michigan Student Assembly
and LSA Student Government
drafted a proposal for a fall study
break in mid-October.
"We are constantly hearing
MSA should do something that
affects students," MSA President
Matt Nolan said in a Daily article.
"I see this as MSAtaking an issue

Nolan added that giving stu-
dents more time to study for
midterms "will consequently
improve the mental and physical
health and the academic quality
of work done at this university."

GOP presidential primary rc
now a contest of character *

a

Romney, Perry
try to attack each
other's values,
credibility
NEW YORK (AP) - The
Republican presidential race has
become a no-holds-barred con-
test over character.
With the pace of the GOP con-
test quickening, Mitt Romney
and Rick Perry are resorting to
tough language online and while
campaigning to undermine each
other's credibility and values.
"It's time for you to tell the
truth," Perry said during last
week's Republican debate, all
but calling the former Massa-
chusetts governor a liar.
The Texas governor also is

trying to cast Romney as some-
one who lacks a core set of
beliefs, highlighting Romney's
shifts on health care and other
'issues in hopes of dislodging
him from atop the field.
Romney is portraying Perry as
a dimwitted novice who coddles
illegal immigrants and takes lib-
erties with his economic record.
"The great challenges we have
we will overcome," Romney said
in South Dakota recently, "if we
have leaders that will tell the
truth, and live with integrity,
and who, by virtue of their life
experience, know how to lead."
It was a suggestion that Perry
didn't fit that bill.
The amped-up rhetoric sig-
nals a more aggressive phase in
the race and sets the tone in the
10 weeks before the nominating
contest begins in Iowa in early

January. It also illuminates
campaign strategies and pre-
views likely attack ads sure to
surface on television soon.
It's raised concerns among
some Republicans, who fear
a drawn out, personal battle
between their top contenders
will only help President Barack
Obama's chances of winning
next year.
"I don't like that, I'm not
for that. I'm a Ronald Reagan
Republican, he didn't think it
was smart to attack each other
and I don't either," oil billion-
aire T. Boone Pickens told Fox
News last week after Romney
and Perry got in each other's
faces during the Las Vegas
debate.
Despite their oft-stated rever-
ence for Reagan, the two lead-
ing Republican hopefuls are
ignoring Reagan's so-called
11th commandment: "Thou
shalt not speak ill of any fellow
Republican."
Romney, seen as the Repub-
lican to beat, has identified
Perry as his top rival, even
with' businessman Herman
Cain polling well and lower-
tier contenders such as Newt
Gingrich and Rick Santo-
rum drawing positive buzz in
debates.
Only Perry has been able
to compete with Romney in
fundraising and the two are
expected to have enough
resources for a protracted
national campaign if neces-
sary. Both have the backing
of powerful special political
action committees that can
raise unlimited funds to run
attack ads of their own.
Romney's campaign has
started web site, www.career-
politician.com , that jabs at

Romney team posted a video

formance last week, stringing

fused.

Alex Pourbaix, president of TransCanada Corp.'s energy and oil pipelines, right, speaks to reporters outside the law
offices of Nebraska Speaker of the Legislature Mike Flood in Norfolk, Neb., Tuesday, Oct.11, 2011.
Nebraska lawmakers to potentially
challenge route of Keystone pipeline

Gov. Dave Heineman
will call special
legislative session
LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -
Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman
said yesterday he will call a spe-
cial legislative session that could
allow lawmakers to challenge
the route of a massive trans-
national oil pipeline, despite
uncertainty about whether such
an effort will succeed or stand
up in court.
The Republican governor said
he wants lawmakers to find a
"legal and constitutional" solu-
tion to allow for state oversight
of oil pipelines, including the
hotly contested Keystone XL
project. The U.S. State Depart-
ment has authority to approve or
scuttle the $7 billion Keystone
project because it would cross
the national border.
Heineman said he will call
lawmakers into session Nov. 1,
which means they'll have little
time to act before the end of the
year, when federal authorities
are scheduled decide the proj-
ect's fate.
The 1,700-mile pipeline,

which would travel through
Montana, South Dakota,
Nebraska, Kansas and Oklaho-
ma, ending up on Texas's Gulf
Coast, would tarry an estimated
700,000 barrels of oil a day, dou-
bling the capacity of an existing
pipeline from Canada.
Heineman has said he sup-
ports the pipeline but opposes
the route, which would cut
through part of the Ogallala
aquifer, a massive water sup-
ply in Nebraska and seven other
states.
The governor acknowledged
lawmakers will face steep chal-
lenges with any proposal that
might affect the project, which
has been in the planning and
review stage for years. Any state
law that tries to derail the pro-
posal will face an all-but-certain
legal challenge.
"At the end of the day I want
to be very, very clear: I believe
we need to make the effort. I
think Nebraskans will appreci-
ate that," Heineman said. "But
it's entirely possible at the end
of the day we'll have this conver-
sation, and the Legislature may
reach the conclusion that we
don't have any legal or constitu-
tional option."

Nebraska Speaker of the Leg-
islature Mike Flood welcomed
the plan to hold a special ses-
sion, despite saying last week
that a bill to reroute the pipeline
would not likely survive a legal
challenge.
"This issue has never been
about whether the state has a
legitimate role in protecting
our groundwater and natural
resources," Flood said. "The
question, for me, has been how
to exercise that role within the
parameters of the law."
Pipeline opponents in the
Legislature are now looking at
ways to amend the bill to focus
on other concerns where the
state would have authority, such
as protecting Nebraska's cultur-
al identity or economic interests.
"If we don't succeed, at least
we will have tried," said state
Sen. Bill Avery of Lincoln. "The
voters will respect at least that."
Supporters say the pipeline
could reduce U.S. dependence
on Middle Eastern oil, while
environmental groups say it
would bring "dirty oil" that
requires huge amounts of ener-
gy to extract and could cause an
ecological disaster in case of a
spill.

fiscal emergency Officials estimate

Gov. Tom Corbett launched
a state takeover of the heavily
indebted capital city yesterday by
declaring a fiscal emergency in
Harrisburg - a move viewed as
the state's most aggressive inter-
vention into the affairs of a Penn-
sylvania city.
Corbett, a Republican, made
the declaration four days after
signing a law that grants him the
ability to take unprecedented con-
trol over much of Harrisburg's
finances, including the ability to
use the city's money to ensure that
government continues to oper-
ate services, issue paychecks to
employees and make pension and
debt payments.
"City Council's failure to enact a
recovery plan in order to deal with

Kenya's capital.
The attacks came only two
days after the U.S. warned of
"imminent" terror attacks. The
U.S. warning had implied that the
Somali group al-Shabab would
carry out reprisals in response to
Kenyan troops' invasion of Soma-
lia in mid-October.

Ennahda party
won at least
30 percent of votes
TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) - A
moderate Islamist party claimed
victory yesterday in Tunisia's
landmark elections as prelimi-
nary results indicated it had won
the biggest share of votes, assur-
ing it will have a strong say in the
future constitution of the coun-
try whose popular revolution led
to the Arab Spring.
The Ennahda party's success
could boost other Islamist par-
ties in the North Africa and the
Middle East, although Ennahda
insists its approach to sharia, or
Islamic law, is consistent with
Tunisia's progressive traditions,
especially in regards to women's
rights.
Party officials estimated
Ennahda had taken at least 30
percent of the 217-seat assem-
bly charged with writing a new
constitution for the country.
Other estimates put the party's
share from Sunday's vote closer
to 50 percent. Official results are

expected today.
International observers laud-
ed the election as free and fair
while emphasizing that the par-
ties in the new government must
work together and safeguard the
rights of women.
There were no official
announcements of domestic
results yesterday, but Tunisian
media outlets posted tallies
from individual polling stations,
making it clear that Ennahda or
Renaissance Party was now the
dominant political force in the
country, coming in first in nearly
every constituency.
Ennahda did take half of the
18 seats reserved for Tunisians
living abroad in official prelimi-
nary results released yesterday.
Two center-left parties took
seven other seats between them
- a distributon of seats expected
to replicated domestically.
"Ennahda has taken first place
on the national level and at the
level of the constituencies," said
Abdel Hamid Jelassi, the party's
campaign manager at a trium-
phant press conference outside
its headquarters amid cheering
supporters.
In the half century since its
1956 independence from France,

Tunisia has been practically a
one-party state until Tunisians
kicked out President Zine El
Abidine Ben Ali in January after
a monthlong popular uprising.
Nine months of unrest, further
demonstrations and political
wrangling in the country of 10
million preceded Sunday's vote,
which saw a huge turnout.
The constituent assembly
elected will have an incredibly
important role in building Tuni-
sia's new democracy. It will not
only appoint a new interim gov-
ernment but write the constitu-
tion that will determine how the
country will function.
Tunisia's elections coincided
with declarations in neighbor-
ing Libya by its new leaders that
the country has been liberated
from the yoke of longtime dicta-
tor Moammar Gadhafi. Libya's
new leaders also announced
plans with a sharply Islamist
tone that could rattle their West-
ern backers.
Ennahda says it wants Islamic
law, to be the source of the coun-
try's legislation, but also insists
that the country's progressive
personal status code is compat-
ible with its ideals and that it
respects all religions and creeds.

Public aproval for pot
Gov. should respond to support for legalization
While a stigma aboutlegalizingmarijuana still exists, public
opinion is slowly shifting in favor of legalization. Accord-
ing to a recent Gallup poll, 50 percent of the American
public supports the legalization of marijuana. The poll indicates that
half of Americans are concerned about the country's harsh marijuana
laws. The federal government should take American opinions on this
issue seriously and make a shift toward legalizing marijuana.

The Gallup poll marks the first split of pub-
lic opinion since polling on the issue began in
1969. The number of legalization supporters
will hopefully continue to rise since younger
generations seem to be more accepting of
marijuana use - 62 percent of people polled
between the ages 18-29 supported legaliza-
tion.
A primary reason for the push for marijua-
na legalization is the appalling and costly war
on drugs. In 2008, the United States had more
people in prisons than any other nation in the
world, according to a New York Times article,
and 500,000 prisoners are in jail for drug
crimes - roughly 20 percent of all prisoners.
Enforcing the nation's marijuana laws
costs the taxpayers money. The government
employs the police force and prosecutors,
covers administrative costs of the legal sys-
tem.and pays to keep offenders in jails. Many
offenses are nonviolent and can be as trivial
as a first-time possession charge. The legaliza-
tion of marijuana would reduce government
spending and keep people who do not pose a
threat to societyout of prisons.
Marijuana legalization also has the poten-
tial to increase government revenue, by allow-
ing the.government to tax marijuana sales. A
2008 study by Harvard University economist
Jeffrey Miron estimated that legalizing and
taxing marijuana would save approximately
$7.7 billion in law enforcement costs and bring
in about $6.7 billion in tax revenue. These are

financial impacts that could have a profound
effect on rebuilding the U.S. economy.
In spite of its rising popularity, complete
legalization may still be far away. But much
can be done in the immediate future to
improve the state's medical marijuana law.
Michigan legalized medicinal marijuana in
2008, yet patients still face legal obstacles in
obtaining their prescriptions.
Across the state, medical marijuana dis-
pensaries have been closing. The current law
is challenging to understand, and the line
between legal and illegal is in many cases
extremely difficult to interpret. Michigan
lawmakers should make substantial efforts to
revise the law to reflect the will of Michigan
voters and to allow patients access to their
medigine. California has passed and imple-
mented laws that grant marijuana dispen-
saries and patients with medical marijuana
prescriptions access to marijuana. Michigan
should follow its model.
Legalizing marijuana on a federal level
would be beneficial on numerous fronts, and
the consistently increasing public support
shows that 50 percent of the American popu-
lation agrees. Enforcing marijuana laws is a
waste of taxpayer money and legalizing the
substance would, in contrast, make the nation
money. The federal government should move
to legalize possession, usage, purchase, sale
and cultivation of marijuana to make ita legal,
government regulated substance.

ook who's comingto campus!
After canceling a visit
scheduled for last March due
to severe weath-
er conditions,
House Majority
Leader Eric Can-
tor (R-Va) is set
to give a lecture
at the Michigan
League on Mon-
day. The event,
sponsored by DANIEL
the Ford School CHARDELL
of Public Policy,
will be free and
open to the public.
Cantor was planning to make a
similar visit to the Wharton School
of Business at the University of Penn-
sylvania last Friday. According to
the school's newspaper The Daily
Pennsylvanian, Cantor was slated to
deliver a much-anticipated speech on
American income inequality titled "A
Fair Shot at the American Dream &
Economic Growth," the text of which
can be found on the newspaper's
website. Given recent reports on the
widening gap between the rich and
poor in the United States, such a
speech would have been timely.
But Cantor never got around to
delivering thatspeech.
The Daily Pennsylvanian reports
that Cantor's office was under the
impression that only those affiliated
with Penn - namely, students and
faculty - were invited to attend. But
after learning that the event would
in fact be open to the general public
(the first 300 people in line would
gain entrance) Cantor called off his
appearance, apparently fearing that
protesters from Occupy Philadel-
phia - an extension of Occupy Wall
Street - would fill all the seats in the
lecture hall.
The abrupt cancellation has
sparked debate at Penn and in the
media. Charles Gray, a student at

Wharton and president of Penn Col-
lege Republicans, accused Occupy
Philly demonstrators of "hijacking
this event and making it into some-
thing that's a bit hostile." Politico
writes, "the cancellation in the face
of protests is the most recent exam-
ple of how Cantor... has emerged as
the chief object of ire for the left."
One unidentified Penn student is
quoted saying, "I think it's a little too
much to bring the protest to a college
campus." And on Twitter, the liberal
political blog Think Progress dryly
wrote, "Eric Cantor is eager to speak
on income inequality as soon as he
can find a venue that can guarantee
no poor people willbe admitted."
Where some have deemed Cantor
a coward, others place blame on the
protesters. That much was inevitable.
Accordingto Mike Morill, director of
the liberal advocacy group Keystone
Progress and one of the protesters at
Penn, demonstrators had no inten-
tion of disrupting Cantor's remarks
- they were simply there to protest
outside the building.
We'll never know, of course, what
would have happened had things
gone as planned. But I find it unfor-
tunate that Cantor didn't give pro-
testers the opportunity to prove
their civility. Rather than face them,
he disengaged altogether. Cantor
canceled because he presumed that
Occupy Philly demonstrators in the
audience would disrupt his speech
and/or ask him questions for which
he was unprepared - in any case, he
comes out looking like an out of touch
politician, and rightfully so
What does this mean for his visit
to Ann Arbor, then? Quite a lot, actu-
ally. Here's my take.
First, we should consider Can-
tor's visit to the University of
Michigan a privilege. That means
respecting him, his beliefs and his
opportunity to address our commu-
nity this Monday afternoon. This is

particularly important for those of
us who oppose Cantor's conserva-
tive ideology. No matter how much
you might disagree with him - and
trust me, I do disagree with him -
this lecture marks a rare opportu-
nity for students to hear firsthand
from one of our country's most
prominent political figures.
Students should
be respectful of
all speakers.

E
If I'm fortunate enoughto be in his
audience on Monday, I'll be there to
listen. I have no intention of infring-
ing on Cantor's ability to deliver his
lecture in its entirety - no heckling,
chanting or interruptions of any
kind - and I'd hope my peers feel
the same. We would win no sympa-
thy and make no gains if we resort
to insolence. I don't want to be can-
non fodder for the likes of Fox News.
We're better than that.
So let's make Cantor live up to
his word and tell us how Republi-
cans plan to address inequality in
America. Let's defy his expectations
of us and be civil. Let's give him no
excuse to cancel his visit to another
college campus. I hope to see Cantor
face down a respectful, level-headed,
informed audience capable of calling
into question his extremist rheto-
ric and flawed economic policies -
policies that have contributed to the
growing inequality of wealth and
opportunity in this country and the
perversion of the so-called Ameri-
can Dream.

DHRUV MADEKA | 'W
The various sides of Occupy'

Change anti-bullying attitudes

Whether or not you believe that Occupy
Wall Street heralds the proverbial Arab
Spring of the American nation, you cannot
ignore the impact it has had on our society's
thinking. The Occupy movement has spread
like wildfire from its nascent New York home
and is shaping the expression of the growing
frustrations of people across the world.
Occupy is a difficult movement to take a
stance on. On one side of the argument, its
protesters have put forth no definite policy
agenda. This leaves a substantial fraction of
people tethering on a decision of whether to
support it while they wait for an articula-
tion of its purpose. The scope of this move-
ment shows widespread agitation, but lacks
the depth that will see reform. Despite the
absence of a coherent agenda, protesters
continue to see millions of dollars spent by
the New York Police Department to protect
both sides of this movement. And no one
can say with certainty that the movement
does not have people with a class-warfare
agenda.
These thoughts, however, don't take away
the fact that Occupy has begun to frame and
direct the discontent of our generation with
a system that has failed us. It truly is an
expression of the anger that we feel toward
the establishments that structure our world.
When I visited Zuccotti Park and then
Times Square over Fall Break, I made sure to
consider the on-goings with a skeptical eye.
On first glance, OWS seems like a hippie con-
gregation in the middle of Manhattan, with
variegated hair colors lining the crowd and
scattered tents and mattresses.
Of course, this prompted the initial reac-
tion that the media has slowly been instilling
in us - the movement is essentially aimless
and reeks of class-warfare. But after a closer

look, that perception slowly changed. Here's
what came to mind.
The protesters aren't just a bunch of out-
of-work hippies looking to complain because
other people are in a better situation than
them. When I stood near the press listening
to them speak and gazing at their signs, the
intellect of the crowd began surfacing. These
people are far from bums and leeches, they're
an organized entity trying to frame a genera-
tion's mindset around their own egalitarian
beliefs. They've also made a conscious effort
to humanize their proverbial enemy, never
blaming a single person, but rather attacking
an idea and a corporation.
The movement is far from violent. Even
though the Times Square clash has been well
recorded, I saw police officers who seemed
to agree with the people they were trying
to keep under control. They weren't there
to suppress freewill, but rather to protect it
- for both sides. This wasn't lost on the pro-
testers, who bore signs saying, "The NYPD
are still heroes." Chants of "All day, all week,
Occupy Wall Street" were interspersed with
cries of thanks to the police officers, who
smiled at the acknowledgement.
The movement is by no means perfect. The
absence of a concrete philosophy and news
of protesters attacking the police certainly
add a sour note. But the true movement,
at its heart, is not caused by boredom or a
sense of injustice at the growing disparity of
wealth. Whether you believe it's a cry of the
have-nots against the haves, or an incipient
thought that will guide us, you must be glad
that it's drawn our attention away from the
trivial things that we pass our day with to
issues whose exigency is paramount.

found a very refreshing head-
line on The Huffington Post last
week, "5 Reasons Why Current
Anti-Bullying
Initiatives Don't
Work."
I was pulled
into this article
because too
much of the con-
tent on the bul-
lying problem is JEREMY
about rhetoric
rather than con- LEVY
tent. Consider
last Thursday,
when the White House website
went purple for Spirit Day. Created
in October 2010, Spirit Day is a day
in which supporters wear purple in
an act of solidarity against anti-gay
bullying. President Barack Obama
spoke out against bullying in a
video that was posted on the page.
He was calm and spoke with per-
fect diction - trademark Obama.
Without a doubt, presidential sup-
port sends a strong signal that the
movement against bullying is gain-
ing ground.
Before I go on, let me be perfectly
clear that the recent surge in support
of anti-bullying measures is a great
thing. I find the "It Gets Better" web-
site very powerful. But even the most
heart-throbbing issues have a wonk-
ish side. Looking beyond the zero-
tolerance mindset of anti-bullying
speeches, there is much less discus-
sion of the real conflicts that public
figures - including teachers, school
boards, local, state and federal office
holders - will grapple with sur-
rounding the bullying issue.
So what are those issues? Let's
turn to The Huffington Post article,
written by Urban Education expert
Christopher Emdin, to find out. His
points largely show that the solu-
tions conjured in public imagina-
tion do not necessarily work on the

ground, and finding real solutions
requires more in-depth discussion
from those with experience on the
issue. Here is a brief summary of his
points:
1) "Zero-tolerance theory
backfires"
Many -anti-bullying initiatives
impose severe punishments that only
demonize bullies and do not remedy
the cause of their behavior.
2) "Avoiding social media is not
a solution"
Bullying is rampant on social
media because children view it as
separate from reality. The solution is
to teach them that their behavior on
the Internet is just as real as in the
classroom.
3) "We address bullying with
celebrity, not expertise"
While celebrities bring attention
to the issue, they cannot offer much
advice in terms of effective policies
and programs.
4) "We forget that the bullied
and the bully are both children"
By punishing children as if they
are adults, we do little to changetheir
behavior.
5) "We turn a blind eye to adult
bullying"
Adults engage in name-calling
and other bullying tactics all the
time. The author uses politicians and
sports casters as prominent figures
who publicly bully.
My main comment is in regard to
the fifth point, and to some degree,
the second. Bullying - among both
adults and children - is an inher-
ently vague concept.
As a kid, I was always perplexed
when adults told me that it wasn't
ok to make jokes at other peoples'
expense. Because wherever you look,
most people do make jokes at the
expense of others. Roommates chide
each other about everything, while
stand-up comedy ranges from teas-
ing to outrageously offensive. Among

adults, I simply don't think this is
going to change. Ending "adult-bul-
lying" would require altering humor
as weknowit(andifyouthink"adult-
bullying" is new, read Aristophanes).
The question with kids is where
to draw the line between teasing and
bullying. On one extreme, we can
all agree that slurs - homophobic,
racist or otherwise - are complete-
ly unacceptable. Similarly, we can
probably all remember high school
peers who were blatantly singled out
and bullied. But beyond such cases,
defining what constitutes bullying
is not easy. In my mind, this is a key
reason why zero-tolerance punish-
ments are impractical.
Even emotional
issues have a
wonkish side.

0

Overall, I think my biggest point
aligns with Emdin's third point.
Addressing bullying with celebrity
and not expertise is similar to talk-
ing with rhetoric but no substance.
Public figures make it sound like
society knows exactly how to solve
the bullying problem when, really,
there are lots of issues to talk about.
Anti-bullying campaigns are doing
a fantastic job raising awareness.
But will the campaigns ultimately
be effective? I've read several opin-
ion pieces in The Michigan Daily
saying that Michigan's state gov-
ernment is irresponsible for not
passing legislation on the issue.
They didn't say anything about the
legislation's quality.

"Instead of getting what we want,

TASK FORCE AIMS TO
IMPROVE RECREATIONAL
FACILITIES
Later in the meeting, the Sen-
ate Assembly's Advisory Task
Force on Faculty Involvement in
Health Plan Incentives discussed
the reasons for establishing a
health promotion program that
would benefit students, faculty
and staff, along with its recom-
mendations on how to implement
the program.
The task force was formed
in September 2010 to identify
incentives for faculty to exercise
and become healthier in order to
drive down costs of health care,
and ultimately save money for the
University. The task force cited
the poor state of the University's
recreational facilities as the major
deterrent for students, faculty and
staff to stay active and healthy.
"If youlook at the facilities here
at (the University), we aren't the
leaders and best. We're not even
in the middle - we're at the bot-
tom," faculty member Charles
Koopmann said.
Koopmann said the issue of
recreational facilities has large-
ly been ignored by the admin-
istration which focuses more
on renovations of athletic and
academic facilities and that
the suggestions put forth by
the Advisory Task Force would
move the administration in a
positive direction.
"The problem with the Cole-
man administration is they really
did not address this like they did
the luxury boxes at the stadium,"
Koopmann said. "They put those

on the high priority list and I
think it's time we put the health
and well-being ofthe faculty, staff
and students at the top of the list,
and this would hopefully be a
guide to do so."
Koopmann said despite the
priority that the Division of Stu-
dent Affairs has placed on rec-
reational facility improvements,
it is not on the administration's
agenda until February, which is
why he hopes the suggestions of
the task force will speed up the
process.
SACUA Chair Kate Barald, a
professor of biomedical engineer-
ing and cell and developmental
biology, said, in an interview
after the meeting, she believes
the recreational facilities need to
be improved for the benefit of the
University.
"We need new and more mod-
ern facilities," Barald said. "We
need them not only to increase
the chances the people will use
them and actually benefit from
them if we mean to be a competi-
tive university to attract the best
students."
Barald said she is optimistic
that new recreational facilities
will be built, especially since it
is a major concern for E. Roys-
ter Harper, vice president for the
Division of Student Affairs.
"It's a major agenda item for
her office," Barald said. "She's
looking at this as part of a student
problem, but there's a synergy
between the students and the
faculty."
Katarina Borer, a professor of
kinesiology in attendance at the
meeting, raised the concern that
rather than focusing on the facili-
ties themselves, it is more impor-
tant to focus on how people use
the facilities. She reasoned that
because behavior change is dif-
ficult, people themselves should
be the greatest concern, not the
buildings.
"I don't think the issue is the
facilities, which are adequate if
people want to go there," Borer
said. "The issue is how many
people will utilize them and how
many of those who utilize them
will show significant changes in
their health."

Staudacher's condition wasn't
improving, he switched to CPR.
"I was doing chest compres-
sions while others around were
screaming for the ushers and
other Michigan people to get
the emergency people to come,"
Sonne said.
One of the fans screaming was
Tardiff's husband. Confused at
first by her husband's behavior,
Tardiff said she turned and saw
Staudacher had collapsed a few
seats down from her in row 60.
As chaos in the section erupted as
people attempted to reach out for
Staudacher or get out of the way,
Tardiff said she was determined
to use her training as a nurse and
assist the fallen stranger.
While Tardiff attempted to

wanted to cut back benefits by
limiting overtime pay, reducing
paid vacation time and requir-
ing union members to contribute
more to their health insurance.
In a speech in front of the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents at its
monthly meeting last month, Keri
Bokor, a nurse who works in the
UMHS Surgical Intensive Care
Unit, said the benefit reductions
essentially amounted to a pay cut
for the nurses.

reach Staudacher through the
crowd, Sonne placed Staudacher
flat on the bleachers as hegave him
CPR. When Tardiff reached the
scene. she started giving him com-
pressions as well, hoping to see a
change in Staudacher's bleak state.
"Leo was not responding,
his colors were not good, so we
continued to do compressions
because at that point, compres-
sions were what we needed to do
to try and get that heart going,"
Tardiff said.
While Staudacher's heart
failed to respond to CPR, Tardiff
said the EMS team moved into
the section, which Tardiff's hus-
band had cleared out, and placed
an automated external defi-
brillator on Staudacher. After
shocking him four times, Tardiff
said she noticed a miraculous
improvement in Staudacher's
condition.
"His color's starting to come
back, he raised his head, looked
around in a sense of;'What just
happened?"' Tardiff said.
Staudacher said he remembers
regaining consciousness in the
stadium, where his sons assured
him he was OK. The Huron Val-
ley Ambulance team then assisted
him out of the stadium to the Uni-
versity of Michigan Cardiovascu-
lar Center for treatment.
At the center, a stint was placed
in Staudacher's heart, and it
returned to normal conditions.
Staudacher watched his beloved
Notre Dame lose during the last
30 seconds of the game from his
"If you take away all of those
things, including making us pay
for more insurance, we're pretty
much taking a pay cut," Bokor said
in a Sept.15 Michigan Daily arti-
cle. "We have nurses that come
from Davison, Flint, Lansing,
Toledo - we service the entire
region. Those nurses aren't going
to want to work here if they don't
have those kinds of benefits."
In June, the MNA filed a griev-
ance with the state against thehos-
pital, claiming it violated state law
and collective bargaining rights
when it unilaterally changed the
work schedules of a handful of

hospital bed, but his own victory
in overcoming death supersedes
any football win. He added if he
had been at home instead of in the
Big House during his heart attack,
he may not have been so lucky.
"My heart stopped, so I was
technically dead for a half a min-
ute," Staudacher said. "Only about
8 percent of the people survive,
and the reason is there isn't a
Marvin Sonne (at home) or a defi-
brillator there to get your heart
started again."
Staudacher, who is now in good
health, couldn't attend the AHA's
heart ball to present the awards to
Sonne and Tardiff due to a busi-
ness trip, but he said he is grate-
ful for their assistance and for the
help of everyone at the University.
For Tardiff, receiving the award
from the AHA was an "over-
whelming" experience, and she
said Staudacher is here today not
just because of her actions, butthe
efforts of everyone in the section,
who either assisted Staudacher
or moved out of the way to allow
room for those who could help.
Though Tardiff has yet to for-
mally meet Staudacher since the
incident, she has learned that they
are both from the same city and
have mutual connections through
her co-workers, friends and family.
Sonne said he was "humbled"
by being invited to the ball, but he
added he doesn't need an award,
as doing the right thing in that
situation is expected of everyone.
"I don't look at this as about us
that helped him, I look at it that
nurses.
Additionally, the MNA orga-
nized a march through Ann Arbor
earlier this month as a means to
rally support for its cause. Hun-
dreds of nurses and supporters
marched from Liberty Plaza on
East Liberty Street to the Univer-
sity Hospital, where they picketed
in front of the building.
Tom Mallon, a UMHS nurse
since 2004 who participated in the
march, said he supported the union
because he didn't like how the hos-
pital was treating the MNA.
"I've historically never been a
pro-union guy, but when I see the

this man was saved, and he can
spend many more years together
with his family and friends,"
Sonne said.
While Sonne heard Stau-
dacher's son making negative
comments toward Michigan at
the start of the game, he said the
rivalry between the fans did not
have any bearing when it came to
assisting Staudacher during the
second quarter. Sonne plans to
meet Staudacher for the first time
on Nov. 11, when Staudacher and
his wife Marge visit Sonne's home
and family.
Staudacher said he received
personal "Get Well" notes from
Michigan coach Brady Hoke and
Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly
after the incident, echoing the
importance of his victory in the
stands over a victory on the field,
and highlighting a happening that
transcended team rivalries.
Staudacher added that the
care from the Michigan fans, the
medical team and the Univer-
sity hospital when he was in need
has made him a Michigan fan
- except when they play Notre
Dame - and has allowed him to
develop a greater appreciation for
human compassion.
"We're all humans and when a
crisis occurs, we come together as
the human family to care for one
another," Staudacher said. "In the
end, we gotto remember it is just a
football game, and there are more
important things in life, and one of
those things is just caring for one
another."
University giving their adminis-
trators and giving their executives
substantial pay increases and then
asking me - as a staff nurse - to
work more hours but reduce my
access to overtime and increase
my health care cost, it's a slap in
the face," Mallon said,in an Oct.12
Michigan Daily article.
The Michigan Student Assembly
also passed a resolution last month
voicing its support of the MNA in
its negotiations.

the education, enforcement and
engineering around creating a
more pedestrian-friendly commu-
nity," Hohnke said. "I think this
is a useful request to ask staff to
explore some new alternatives."
Due to changing technology in
pedestrian crossing mechanisms,
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
and Hohnke said they are looking
forward to seeing the proposals
the staff is expected to develop
and share with the council later
this fall. They both expressed
their support to explore alterna-
tives to the current High-inten-
sity Activated crossWalK - an
overhead lighting system acti-
vated by a button on the sidewalk
- which is installed at several
intersections throughout the city.
The current law states that
drivers must stop and yield for
pedestrians approaching or with-
in a crosswalk, as outlined in an
ordinance adopted by the city in

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

July 2010. Council member Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1) stressed the
importance of clarifying the use
of "approaching" in the ordi-
nance due to the ambiguity that
she feels it creates.
"That language is too vague for
people to feel comfortable about
what to do," Briere said.
Briere also brought up the issue
of having a bus stop near a cross-
walk, which poses a threat for
pedestrians since drivers cannot
determine whether individuals
are attempting to cross a street or
waiting for a bus.
Council member Marcia Hig-
gins (D-Ward 4) said she appreci-
ates the resolution, which might
help to prevent dangerous situ-
ations like the one she said she
witnessed a few weeks ago at the
intersection of Crest Avenue and
West Liberty Street.
"I had been on a cross street
watching a person wait and saw
a motorist stop on one side of the
street and almost get hit and have
people honking horns and shoot-
ing out around them... and yet the

(vehicles) coming from the other
side never stopped because they
hadn't seen that pedestrian yet,"
Higgins described.
Initiatives for increased safety
measures for pedestrians in the
city have been a major concern in
previous years, especially in light
of a tragic incident in which two
University students, Teh Nan-
nie Roshema Roslan and Norha-
nanim Zainol, were killed when
they were struck by a vehicle
while crossing Plymouth Road in
November 2003.
Their deaths instigated an ini-
tiative by City Council to improve
crossing safety. A new traffic
signal and medians were con-
structed two years later at the
intersection of Traverwood Drive
and Plymouth Road.
Council member Stephen Kun-
selman (D-Ward 3) said he felt
there were other areas in the city
where safety measures should be
improved for pedestrians, such
as Packard Street, and added that
he would ask the staff to consider
these areas as well.

Pro-life and pro-choice groups debate issues of abortion in the Michigan Union last night.

Las Vegas still fumes over
2-year-old Obama remark

President counting
on Nevada in
re-election
LAS VEGAS (AP) - President
Barack Obama has a Sin City
problem that won't go away.
Obama is counting on Nevada's
support for re-election next year.
He easily won the Las Vegas Val-
ley in 2008 and will probably win
the largely Democratic, urban
center again next year.
But some Nevada state officials
and residents of this economical-
ly ravaged state have been fuming
over comments they perceived as
rants against the tourism indus-
try since he first made them two
years ago, and Republicans are
hoping that fury will pointvoters
in their direction.

The friction resurfaced as
Obama visited a Las Vegas neigh-
borhood Monday as part of a
nationwide tour to sell his jobs
plan. The stop came as Repub-
lican presidential candidates,
business titans and former Las
Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman
maintain that Obama has twice
disparaged Las Vegas tourism -
this Western swingstate's largest
employer.
The jabs are notable because
casino-dependent Nevada has
the highest unemployment rate
in the nation, and Obama can't
afford to have voters blame
him as his Republican rivals
try to convince the nation that
they would do a better job of
turning the stalled economy
around. Nevada's unemployment
remained steady at 13.4 percent
last month.

"He said it more than once,"
said former Nevada Gov. Bob
List, a national Republican com-
mitteeman. "You can't un-ring
the bell. You have to live with
what you say. It just shows a lack
of understanding of the engine
that drives the state."
The feud began in 2009, when
Obama admonished corporations
using federal bailout money: "You
can't go take a trip to Las Vegas
or go down to the Super Bowl on
the taxpayer's dime." A year later,
Obama warned families against
gambling away college tuition:
"You don't blow a bunch of cash
in Vegas when you're trying to
save for college."
The call for financial respon-
sibility didn't sit well with some
Las Vegans, and Democratic and
Republican lawmakers in Nevada
all lashed back at the time.

From Page 1
"Human development begins
at fertilization and does not stop
at birth," LSA sophomore Joe
Lipa, a member of Students for
Life, said.
The discussion was heated
during the 90-minute debate.
Both sides expressed frustra-
tion about the complex argu-
ment concerning the definition
of life and the rights of both
women and fetuses.
While speaking about the
illegality of abortion, LSA
junior Dakota Hadfield, a mem-
ber of the Secular Student Alli-
ance, hit the podium and called
abortion unfair.
"This is masochism being
offered to you by sadists," Hat-
field yelled.
Earlier in the debate, LSA
sophomore Katie Dieckman, a
member of the Secular Student
Alliance, held up hangers and
knitting needles - which she
said are instruments used for

abortion in countries where it's
illegal - to argue the danger of
abortion alternatives.
"This is the reality we are
forcing if abortion becomes ille-
gal," said Diekman, while hold-
ing the instruments.
The Secular Student Asso-
ciation also talked about how an
overturn of the Supreme Court
ruling would directly affect
poverty and mortality rates and
unfairly penalize women and
doctors.
LSA junior Anna Paone of
Students for Life said there are
ways to support women's rights
without harming others.
"Feminine empowerment
does not mean killing unborn
women," Paone said.
Throughoutthe debate, mem-
bers of Students for Life held
steadfast in their beliefs of the
rights of the dependent unborn
over those of the mother, while
the Secular Student Alliance
stayed constant in their views of
the mother's right to choose.
"Our rights end when some-

one else's begins," LSA senior
Elise Aikman, a Students for
Life representative, said.
LSA sophomore Sahana
Prasad of the Secular Student
Alliance, countered: "(Abortion
is) depriving the fetus use of the
body ... which the fetus has no
right to in the first place,"
In an interview before the
event, Rackham Graduate
School student Andrew Patton,
a member of Students for Life,
said he saw the debate as an
opportunity for students to see
the principles of his group.
"I think people make the mis-
take that the decision to be pro-
life is irrational," Patton said.
Though there were criti-
cisms voiced during the debate,
Public Policy junior Michael
Jacobson, a Secular Student
Alliance representative, pro-
posed that the two groups work
together to address the roots of
abortion. Unplanned pregnan-
cy and alternatives to abortion
were proposed to be the focus
of future conversation.

College hockey received some
tough news Monday as college
hockey's southern-most program,
Alabama-Huntsville, fell victim
to budget cuts and lost its varsity
status.
After hosting the 2012 Frozen
Four, the Chargers will become a
club program starting next sea-
son.
But in the state of Michigan,
there couldn't be a more exciting
time to be a college hockey fan.
No matter the spot on the mit-
ten - or even above it - there is
bound to be a team nearby play-
ing high-caliber hockey.
Michigan coach Red Beren-
son believes the unbounded tal-
ent in programs across the state
starts with homegrown players.
It's not too difficult for coaches
like Berenson to keep nationally-
recruited skaters in their home
state with some of the nation's
best competition awaiting upon
arrival.
"That's where the players are
going to go (is Michigan)," Beren-
son said. "They're not all going to
come (to Ann Arbor) and they're
not all going to be a good fit."
And with the talent pool over-
flowing from the Upper Peninsu-
la to Metro Detroit, those recruits
aren't limited with choices of
where to play collegiately.
In fact, of the 20 ranked teams
in the USCHO.com poll, five play
their home games in Michigan.
Right now, the 4th-ranked Wol-
verines (0-1-1 CCHA, 4-1-1 over-
all) are caught in the midst of a
vicious portion of their schedule,
consisting of three consecutive
two-game sets against Michigan
schools boasting local products.
"Everybody's playing with
confidence and something to
prove," Berenson said. "But these
teams have proven (themselves)
already."
No. 6 Ferris State is a perfect
example of an in-state team that

has struggled historically against
the nation's best. But this season,
the Bulldogs have staked their
claim as one of those elites. With
Ferris State coming to Yost Ice
Arena Thursday fresh off a sweep
of Miami (Ohio), confidence will
be peaking. There's nothing the
Bulldogs would like more than to
leave with a historic sweep of the
Wolverines.
In that series, Michigan
natives like senior defender Greg
Pateryn, freshman forward Tra-
vis Lynch and fifth-year senior
netminder Shawn Hunwick will
face off against fellow Michigan-
der C.J. Motte -Ferris State's
goaltender.
Even No. 18 Lake Superior
State, a team Berenson picked to
finish in the league's bottom half,
has looked stellar early on, gain-
ing critical momentum for con-
ference play.
"In this league, every weekend
is tough," Berenson said. "At the
start of the year, nobody thinks
they're going to finish in last
place."
And all of the in-state pro-
grams are CCHA members, with
the exception of Michigan Tech.
Translation: Most weekends of
conference play will be as try-
ing as last weekend's affair with
Northern Michigan, which felt
more like a heavyweight fight
than a hockey series. In Friday's
loss and Saturday's shootout win,
there was hardly a moment on
ice without a goal scored, lead
exchanged or punch thrown.
As long as the state continues
to serve as a breeding ground for
the top talent out of high school,
college coaches will visit - from
near and far - to tap into the
fertile soil and get their share of
Michiganders.
"If you look at the USA hockey
^magazine, they show you where
all the (college hockey) play-
ers come from," Berenson said.
"When it comes down to how
many from each state, Michigan
is right uo there."

the locker room and in practice
and the intensity wasn't where it
was now."
Hoke's _calm and confident
demeanor ripples throughout the
team, said senior tight end Kevin
Koger. When Hoke was asked
whether he said anything differ-
ent to his team after the Michi-
gan State game, considering the
meltdown that ensued the previ-
ous two years, Hoke pointed to his
own unflappable consistency.
"We have a very honest office,
whether it's good or bad we'll talk
about it," Hoke said.
In recent weeks, players have
praised coordinators Greg Mat-
tison and Al Borges and their
gameplans and in-game adjust-
ments. If Michigan starts sliding
again, the mere presence of Hoke,
Mattison and Borges - and the
players' unrelenting confidence
in their coaches - could make all
the difference.
The first sign of change came
last week: the players were eager

to come into Schembechler Hall
on their days off during the bye
week and work on preparing for
Purdue on their own. Koger joked
hemight need to pick up a hobby
because he had nothing to do
without football.
Washing out the bad taste of
the 28-14 loss to Michigan State
will be the first step towards
finishing strong. Van Bergen ref-
erenced one of former Michigan
coach Lloyd Carr's favorite slo-
gans when the senior said they
just had to "control the control-
lables" and worry about fixing
themselves first - physically and
mentally.
"I'd be lying to you if I said we
weren't down for a while (after the
Michigan State loss)," Van Bergen
said. "We had a good thing going.
The big thing is - it's not done yet.
Yeah we lost a game, but that was
just a bump in the road. If you let it
affect you in the weeks following,
then you're going to get beat twice.
And we're not going to let that hap-
pen as a team."

junior Craig Roh plays. LEFT GUARD BATTLE ROYALE:

Redshirt junior Ricky Barnum was
expected to be the team's starting
left guard all season. Penciled in,
his name had to be replaced with
redshirt sophomore Michael Scho-
field in the season opener as Bar-
num was suspended.
Barnum returned and played
the next three games before suf-
fering an ankle-injury and now he
has missed the Wolverines past
three games, with the 6-foot-7,
Schofield replacing him again.
After the bye week, Hoke said
that Barnum is now healthy and
the two will compete to start Sat-
urday against Purdue.
"I guess we're going to have
to see in this week of practice -
if Ricky's all the way ready or if
Schofield's better," said fifth-year
senior center Dave Molk. "(We'll)
see how the whole thing plays out."
Neither Barnum nor Schofield
played exceptionally well in his
stint at the position. And with
Barnum's return, the question for
Molk and the rest of the offensive
line is whether removing Schofield
messes with their chemistry.
"I like consistency, that's always
a good thing especially with how
offensive line play is," Molk said.
"We're not individuals, we work
together. ... But if there's one guy
who can play better than the other

guy, it's better to make the switch.
"We're improving greatly as
the season goes along. Where we
started at the beginning of the
season, with Ricky being a first-
year starter and that was a little
shaky. Then when Ricky got hurt
we had Schofield and that was a
little shaky. Now, we're evening
out. Both have that game experi-
ence where they can come in and
play."
One intriguing option brought
up by a reporter was whether
Schofield and Barnumwould com-
pete with redshirt junior Patrick
Omameh at the right guard posi-
tion. Hoke wouldn't commit to
Omameh being a part of the other
two's open competition, but per-
haps he should be put on notice.
"(Omameh's) been playing
decent," Molk said. "You always
have to worry about losing your
spot. I know that's a bad thing to
say, but you always have to work to
get better every week."
RAWLS IS ROLLING: On Mon-
day, Koger declared true fresh-
man running back Thomas Rawls
as one young offensive player who
could emerge down the stretch.
Through seven games, most
of the running back load has
been delegated between redshirt
sophomore Fitzgerald Toussaint

and junior Vincent Smith. Rawls, "Thomas Rawls, he's getting a
a 5-foot-10, 219-pound bruising lot more snaps at running back,"

Consistency and
cohesiveness reign
on 'Mylo Xyloto'
By ELLIOT ALPERN
Daily Arts Writer
"I don't think bands should
keep going past 33," the now
34-year-old Chris Martin once
told Britain's
Daily Express. *
But io and
behold, "old Coldp~y
man" Mar-
tin and his Mylo Xyloto
merry quartet Parlohone
have churned p
out their fifth
album since 2000, and another
shoo-in to go platinum - make
it five for five. Mylo Xyloto is a
fairly obvious departure from
2008's Viva la Vida, ditching
the French Revolution-inspired
strings for a bright palette of
electric uppers and cushioned
floaters. And as surely as the
record will spawn its share of
hits, Mylo Xyloto will be lam-
pooned by its haters as one more
step toward a pop-fueled sellout.
In fact, it's fairly easy to
point out where Martin (or his
producers) tried to inject some
popular demand into his work.
"Princess of China," the second
single scheduled to be released,
is overarching and sincerely cap-
tivating - until Rihanna bursts
in (and won't leave until the song
ends). Though the single is sure

to be popular among a variety
of crowds, it becomes hard to
stomach upon the realization
that it could've been a veritable
classic without the cameo.
However, that's not to say
Coldplay has left its dedicated
fan base as an afterthought.
On the contrary - Mylo Xyloto,
underneath the thin concept of
love in a gritty, graffitied world,
is still your average Coldplay
album (and really, aren't they
all?). "U.F.O.," the modest two-
minute interlude between the
behemoth sounds in "Major
Minus" and "Princess of China,"
harkens back to the band's ori-
gins in Parachutes. "Lord, I don't
know which way I am going,"
sings Martin, and the delicate
guitar couples with his vulner-
ability to create a surprising
contender among the best tracks
in the entire work.
Few bands can achieve the
most redeeming aspect of Mylo
Xyloto: a record-wide consisten-
cy of content. This achievement
is even more pronounced when
considering the dependability
revealed in the British outfit's
four prior releases. Immedi-
ately after the album's prelude,
Coldplay reels off a three-round
burst of heavyweights with
"Hurts Like Heaven," the even-
tual single "Paradise" and the
recent crowd favorite "Charlie
Brown." While the latter has a
straight path to the top of the
charts, Mylo Xyloto rounds itself
out appropriately with the delib-
erate and heavy "Up in Flames,"

and the contrastingly elated "Up
with the Birds."
Longtime Coldplay fans
received their first taste of the
new material earlier this sum-
mer in the incarnation of "Every
Teardrop Is a Waterfall." The
single is tremendously represen-
tative of the record as a whole
- it isn't afraid to turn to the
synthesizers, but neither does it
build around them. Inevitably,
the listener is left with Martin's
soaring vocals and the impres-
sively cohesive talents of the
other band members.
Mylo Xyloto's flashy, colorful
cover isn't a falade - the rain-
bow of graffiti seems to stem
directly from the quality of its
tracklist. And though Coldplay
has taken a supposedly different
course from its norm, such is the
case with every work the band
has completed since Parachutes.
Eventually, one must realize
that it's almost always the same,
be that favorable or abrasive. As
much as the band, changes, it
never really differs. It's Coldplay
- don't overthink it.

n a popular YouTube video,
acclaimed filmmaker David
Lynch ("Mulholland Dr.")
says, "If you're playingthe movie

ence the film.
You'll think
you've expe-
rienced it,
but you'll be
cheated. It's
such a sadness PHILIP
that you think CONKLIN
you've seen a
film on your
fuckingtelephone. Get real."
Lynch, along with his vehe-
ment hatred of cell phones with
video capabilities, clearly has
strong opinions on how we expe-
rience cinema. It's an issue that
seems particularly relevant now-
adays. Advances in technology
provide new, ever-easier ways to
watch movies. Video-on-demand'
services like Netflix and iTunes
allow us to watch whatever we
want, at any time, on anything
with a screen. Meanwhile, Blu-
ray and high-definition televi-
sions have made home viewing
look better than ever. But are any
of these substitutes for the the-
ater experience so revered by the
likes of Lynch?
Historically, films were
always seen ina movie theater.
From the birth of cinema to
roughly the 1950s, the only way
to see a movie was to go to athe-
ater. Then, with the rise of net-
work television in the early '50s,
one could see movies at home,
but only movies the networks
would show. Starting around
1980, home viewing became pop-
ular, first with LaserDiscs, then
VHS, DVDs and finally Blu-ray.
Today, non-theater viewing
has become the norm. Though

Allen ("Home

return to television. However, in
true "Home Improvement"/Tim
Taylor fashion, not everything
goes as planned. In a display of
unapologetic intolerance and
lackluster humor, ABC's "Last

wood's beloved father figure into
an unlikable epitome of all that
is (supposedly) "man." How's
that for a family reunion?
The dynamic may sound
familiar: Mike Baxter (Allen) is
a working father, providing for a
wife and three children - none
of whom are Jonathan Taylor
Thomas (so slide that'96 issue of
"Tiger Beat" back under the bed

Man, a fictional outdoor sport-

to modernize his approach to
attracting customers through
several online video rants, most
of which end in a critique of the
fallacies of the "modern man."
Unfortunately for Mike -
and for ABC - his portrayal of
a "real" man is equally disap-
pointing. His resistance to mod-
ern technology and marketing
strategy is matched by a resis-
tance to a modern attitude, free
of misogyny and homophobia.
Allen, a family-oriented Holly-
wood icon known for his roles
as the bumbling Tim Taylor,
Buzz Lightyear and Santa Claus,
is awkward and unnatural in
the position of unapologetical-
ly macho and oblivious "man's
