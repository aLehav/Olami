Dialogue 
addresses 
racism in 
healthcare

Discussion focuses on 
racial discrimination 
faced by new mothers

MELANIE TAYLOR
Daily Staff Reporter 

Jay Bochert earned both 
his 
master’s 
degree 
and 
PhD in sociology from the 
University of Michigan and 
worked as a graduate student 
instructor. He also spent 
seven years in prison before 
attending the University. 
Bochert is a researcher 
and quantitative analyst at 
the Drug Policy Alliance, a 
co-founder of the Formerly 
Incarcerated College Gradu-
ates Network and an assis-
tant professor of sociology at 
the John Jay School of Crim-
inal Justice. 
Bochert continued by dis-
cussing the powerful sym-
bolic nature of the policy 
which will require Univer-
sity employees to disclose 
felony allegations. Bochert 
examined how, while the fel-
ony disclosure policy itself 
does not impact admissions, 
the message the policy sends 
could prevent qualified peo-
ple from applying. He also 
noted that the University is 
an influential school and it 
could lead other universities 

to implement similar poli-
cies.
“Aside from the people 
who 
decide 
not 
to 
even 
apply or decide that they are 
never going to make it into a 
school,” Bochert said. “And 
there are lots of people who 
just give up like that, there 
are going to be loads of people 
who are going to be affected 
by the symbolic nature of this 
change.” 
Bochert graduated in 2016 
and received many national 
and school-specific awards, 
including 
the 
Emerging 
Diversity 
Scholar 
award 
from the National Center for 
Institutional Diversity, the 
Mellon American Council of 
Learned Societies Disserta-
tion Completion Fellowship 
Doctoral Candidate Research 
Grant, the Rackham Merit 
Fellow and, most recently, a 
certificate of recognition for 
research mentoring. 
Bochert said despite all he 
accomplished on campus, the 
new felony disclosure policy 
sends a message the Univer-
sity does not value those with 
a criminal background.

Professor examines implications 
of Harvard discrimination lawsuit

ADMINISTRATION

Rule mandating staff reveal any felony 
charges draws criticism, concern

EMMA STEIN
Daily Staff Reporter 

Lawyer advised school during trial to determine if admissions process violated civil rights

NIKKI KIM
Daily Staff Reporter

On 
Wednesday 
afternoon, 
around 100 students gathered in 
Rackham auditorium to listen to 
Julie Park, associate professor 
at the University of Maryland 
and author of “Race on Campus: 
Debunking Myths with Data,” 
discuss the implications behind 
Students for Fair Admissions 
v. Harvard, the lawsuit against 
Harvard University to deter-
mine if the college violated the 
Civil Rights Act by discriminat-
ing against Asian Americans 
through their college admissions 
process. Park was the consulting 
expert for the trial, serving as 
defense for Harvard. 
Her talk comes amidst recent 

controversy 
surrounding 
the 
college admissions bribery scan-
dals in schools like University 
of Southern California, George-
town University, Yale University 
and Stanford University. 
The talk was part of a larger 
seminar series by the National 
Center for Institutional Diver-
sity, aiming to invite scholars 
who promote academic under-
standing of both historical and 
contemporary issues about race, 
oppression, power and how they 
occur on campus.
Park’s choice to come to the 
University of Michigan was in 
part driven by her personal con-
nection to it. She explained that 
she was inspired by the early 
2000s University of Michigan 
lawsuits and decided to pursue 

what is now her current academic 
path. Her research on the relation-
ship between affirmative action 
and Asian Americans works to 
question and debunk the myths 
surrounding 
Asian 
Americans 
through statistical data.
“We need to think about how 
we fit into this broader landscape, 
what our stories are and how they 
might be used or exploited by 
other if we don’t take own-
ership of our own stories,” 
Park said.
She referenced one of the ear-
lier college admissions lawsuits: 
the second Abigail Fisher case. In 
2016, Abigail Fisher was one of the 
plaintiffs challenging University 
of Texas in a case investigating 
admissions discrimination based 
on skin color. 

After the first Fisher case, 
Edward Blum, president of SFFA 
and the man leading the initiative 
to eliminate all race-conscious 
admissions, developed a website 
called harvardnotfair.org. After 
four failed cases where the plain-
tiffs were all white with B-average 
grades, the anti-affirmative action 
movement changed their strategic 
course to focus on Asian Ameri-
cans with exceptional grades.
According to Park, Asian Amer-
icans make more sympathetic 
plaintiffs than white students 
with mediocre grades.
“There were a lot of Black and 
Latinx applicants with better 
grades who didn’t get in,” Park 
said.

KARTIKEYA SUNDARAM/Daily
Julie J. Park, associate professor of education at the University of Maryland, presents a lecture at the Research & Scholarship Seminar Series: 
Affirmative Action, Asian Americans, and the Harvard Case at Rackham Auditorium Wednesday afternoon.

Wednesday 
evening 
the 
International House Ann Arbor 
hosted “Asylum Journey: 10 Years 
in the Immigration System,” 
featuring Knight-Wallace Fellow 
Emilio Gutiérrez Soto and his son, 
Oscar Gutiérrez Soto, who spoke 
on their experiences immigrating 
to the United States from Mexico. 
The event was organized by the 
University of Michigan Center for 
Latin American and Caribbean 
Studies, the Interfaith Council for 
Peace and Justice and Washtenaw 
Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant 
Rights (WICIR). 
Gutiérrez 
Soto, 
speaking 
through a translator, recounted his 
experience facing persecution by 
the government as a journalist in 
Mexico. After facing surveillance 
and the destruction of his home 
by the military in Mexico, he 
entered the United States with his 
son in 2008. Since immigrating, 
the Gutiérrez Sotos have been 
detained in ICE facilities twice, 
most recently for eight months in 
2017. His application for asylum 
was recently denied, and his 
attorney filed an appeal to the U.S. 
Board of Immigration Appeals.

Students awoke Friday morn-
ing to news of mass shootings in 
two mosques in New Zealand, 
killing 50. The next day, dur-
ing a vigil to commemorate the 
lives lost in New Zealand, police 
officers ran into the crowd urg-
ing people to flee the Diag, where 
the vigil was being held. Shortly 
after, the University issued an 
emergency alert telling students 
to “run, hide, fight”, alleging that 
an active shooter was on campus. 
Though the situation was eventu-
ally resolved and confirmed to be 
a false alarm, many students spent 
over two hours in hiding from 
what they believed to be a lethal 
threat.

When Public Policy senior Zoha 
Qureshi, vice president of external 
affairs for the Muslim Students’ 
Association, first heard about the 
attacks in New Zealand, she felt 
“numb.” She did not want to read 
the stories or see the video circling 
the Internet. She suppressed the 
news and went to sleep, hoping it 
was not true. It was not until the 
next morning that Qureshi was 
forced to confront the reality of 
the tragedy.
“That’s when I started to feel 
like, ‘Oh my god. No. I can’t believe 
this is happening,’’” Qureshi said.
News of New Zealand shoot-
ings affected Qureshi more than 
any other story in what she sees 
as a constant influx of tragic news 
and gun violence plaguing her 
newsfeed.

According to Qureshi, this 
attack was more personal than the 
others.
“I just remember every time a 
mass shooting happens, I always 
worry like, ‘Oh my God. What will 
I do if it hits a community close 
to home?’” Qureshi said. “Every 
mass shooting is a terrible situa-
tion, right, but I was always just 
hoping it would of course never 
happen again but then never enter 
a mosque or never affect a com-
munity that’s close to me, but then 
it did.”
LSA junior Silan Fadlallah, stu-
dent coordinator for the Islamo-
phobia Working Group, echoed 
Qureshi’s sentiments. Fadlallah 
could not wrap her mind around 
how someone could be so hate-
ful in the face of her community’s 

peace and hospitality.
“It really did get to me, and I did 
get emotional at one point because 
even though I’m not a super, super 
practicing Muslim, I do definitely 
consider myself spiritually Mus-
lim,” Fadlallah said. “It was just 
difficult for me to really challenge 
myself to process the fact that 
Islamophobia is so, so real.”
After some initial grieving, 
both 
Qureshi 
and 
Fadlallah 
sprung into action to console the 
University Muslim community, 
also awash in fear and shock. 
Muslim Student Association orga-
nized a DPSS security presence 
for their upcoming Jumu’ah ser-
vice, the same Friday prayer that 
had been disrupted by the attacks 
in New Zealand.

MAX KUANG/Daily

When you’re stressed 
with finals and midterms, 
how do you cope? How 
do you strike a balance 
between both work and 
fun?

“The first thing I do is make 
a written schedule that 
organizes what to do each 
day, just so I make sure I 
finish everything I need to 
do. I also like studying with 
friends and studying ahead 
of time so that way it’s a 
more fun and relaxed time 
instead of really stressful... 
I also love my sorority, like 
I only get to see the girls 
on the weekends but we’ve 
grown so close and I know 
I always have them to go 
out with or to learn on for 
support—so that makes 
the week worth it.”

“Students as future leaders 
— whether they’re in health-
care professions or not — we 
really wanted them to criti-
cally think about some of the 
issues that we’re facing in the 
world in general and what 
you would do about it.”
The dialogue began with 
an expert panel that included 
nurses, 
obstetrician-gyne-
cologists, professors and re-
searchers interested in the 
topic.
The panelists discussed 
what they believe to be 
the key issues facing Black 
women in prenatal health-

care in response to three 
articles that were recom-
mended reading before the 
event: Why America’s Black 
Mothers and Babies Are in a 
Life-or-Death Crisis, Amer-
ica is Failing its Black Moth-
ers and What States Aren’t 
Doing to Save New Mothers’ 
Lives. 
Charisse Marie Loder, a 
clinical lecturer at Michigan 
Medicine, summarized the 
discrimination Black women 
face in health care due to im-
plicit racism.
“All of the readings that 
were 
assigned 
today 
re-
ally focus on issues such 
as poor prenatal care, poor 
access to care, and what 
really disturbs me is the 

relationships between the 
providers and the patients 
that were described,” Loder 
said. “Often concerns were 
tossed 
aside 
or 
obvious 
medical problems or vital 
sign abnormalities were ig-
nored, and that’s a result of 
implicit bias or racism, and 
I think that’s something 
that we need to address in 
our training and work on 
reducing that as much as 
possible.”
Following the first panel, 
attendees split into groups 
surrounding facilitators seat-
ed around the room and re-
sponded to the ideas put forth 
by the panelists. Students 
and alumni from a variety of 
disciplines within medicine 
shared their responses and 
proposed ideas regarding 
how to fight inequity.
Kinesiology 
senior 
Bri-
anna Kennedy said she was 
invited to the event after at-
tending a previous Martin 
Luther King Jr. symposium 
and was interested in the 
topic because she is study-
ing both athletic training 
and Afroamerican and Afri-
can studies.
“It is a bridging gap be-
tween my major and mi-
nor in a way, with race and 
health, so it’s an interesting 
event to come to,” Kennedy 
said.
The second group of pan-
elists then shared their own 
thoughts on issues of racism 
in healthcare.
Jessica Fladger, a certified 
nurse midwife, stressed the 
importance 
of 
healthcare 
providers 
acknowledging 
their own internal biases.
 “I think the problem in 
our society is when we think 
about racism we think about 
the Ku Klux Klan, we think 
about obvious implications 

of racism, and we don’t think 
about our own internal bias-
es and how we react to peo-
ple who don’t look like us,” 
Fladger said. “We all have bi-
ases — it doesn’t matter what 
color you are, where you’re 
from, how you speak — we all 
have internal biases that we 
first have to address before 
we try to fix any problem that 
our nation is currently fac-
ing.”
After the second group of 
panelists spoke and respond-
ed to questions, attendees 
again broke into groups and 
discussed the new topics 
that had come up. Follow-
ing the final discussions, 
each panelist gave a closing 
remark reflecting on the dia-
logue overall and urging that 
attendees continue the con-
versations and advocate for 
women.
Dr. Lisa Kane Low, associ-
ate professor at the School of 
Nursing, said the conversa-
tion inspired her.
“There can be spaces and 
time where you start to get 
discouraged and you start to 
get cynical, and this is the 
kind of space that inspires 
you not to go to that ugly 
place but to be inspired and 
move forward,” Low said. “I 
look forward to many of you 
being the leaders that help 
us get past the errors of our 
ways and help us move for-
ward.”
The event was sponsored 
by the University of Michigan 
Schools of Nursing, Dentist-
ry, Kinesiology, Public Health 
and Social Work, College of 
Pharmacy, Michigan Medi-
cine and Michigan Institute 
for Clinical and Health Re-
search.

The talk was part of a larger 
seminar series by the National 
Center for Institutional Diver-
sity, aiming to invite scholars 
who promote academic under-
standing of both historical and 
contemporary issues about race, 
oppression, power and how they 
occur on campus.
Park’s choice to come to the 
University of Michigan was in 
part driven by her personal con-
nection to it. She explained that 
she was inspired by the early 
2000s University of Michigan 
lawsuits and decided to pursue 

what is now her current academic 
path. Her research on the relation-
ship between affirmative action 
and Asian Americans works to 
question and debunk the myths 
surrounding 
Asian 
Americans 
through statistical data.
“We need to think about how 
we fit into this broader landscape, 
what our stories are and how they 
might be used or exploited by 
other if we don’t take own-
ership of our own stories,” 
Park said.
She referenced one of the ear-
lier college admissions lawsuits: 
the second Abigail Fisher case. In 
2016, Abigail Fisher was one of the 
plaintiffs challenging University 
of Texas in a case investigating 
admissions discrimination based 
on skin color. 

After the first Fisher case, 
Edward Blum, president of SFFA 
and the man leading the initiative 
to eliminate all race-conscious 
admissions, developed a website 
called harvardnotfair.org. After 
four failed cases where the plain-
tiffs were all white with B-average 
grades, the anti-affirmative action 
movement changed their strategic 
course to focus on Asian Ameri-
cans with exceptional grades.
According to Park, Asian Amer-
icans make more sympathetic 
plaintiffs than white students 
with mediocre grades.
“There were a lot of Black and 
Latinx applicants with better 
grades who didn’t get in,” Park 
said.

Students awoke Friday morn-
ing to news of mass shootings in 
two mosques in New Zealand, 
killing 50. The next day, dur-
ing a vigil to commemorate the 
lives lost in New Zealand, police 
officers ran into the crowd urg-
ing people to flee the Diag, where 
the vigil was being held. Shortly 
after, the University issued an 
emergency alert telling students 
to “run, hide, fight”, alleging that 
an active shooter was on campus. 
Though the situation was eventu-
ally resolved and confirmed to be 
a false alarm, many students spent 
over two hours in hiding from 
what they believed to be a lethal 
threat.

When Public Policy senior Zoha 
Qureshi, vice president of external 
affairs for the Muslim Students’ 
Association, first heard about the 
attacks in New Zealand, she felt 
“numb.” She did not want to read 
the stories or see the video circling 
the Internet. She suppressed the 
news and went to sleep, hoping it 
was not true. It was not until the 
next morning that Qureshi was 
forced to confront the reality of 
the tragedy.
“That’s when I started to feel 
like, ‘Oh my god. No. I can’t believe 
this is happening,’’” Qureshi said.
News of New Zealand shoot-
ings affected Qureshi more than 
any other story in what she sees 
as a constant influx of tragic news 
and gun violence plaguing her 
newsfeed.

According to Qureshi, this 
attack was more personal than the 
others.
“I just remember every time a 
mass shooting happens, I always 
worry like, ‘Oh my God. What will 
I do if it hits a community close 
to home?’” Qureshi said. “Every 
mass shooting is a terrible situa-
tion, right, but I was always just 
hoping it would of course never 
happen again but then never enter 
a mosque or never affect a com-
munity that’s close to me, but then 
it did.”
LSA junior Silan Fadlallah, stu-
dent coordinator for the Islamo-
phobia Working Group, echoed 
Qureshi’s sentiments. Fadlallah 
could not wrap her mind around 
how someone could be so hate-
ful in the face of her community’s 

peace and hospitality.
“It really did get to me, and I did 
get emotional at one point because 
even though I’m not a super, super 
practicing Muslim, I do definitely 
consider myself spiritually Mus-
lim,” Fadlallah said. “It was just 
difficult for me to really challenge 
myself to process the fact that 
Islamophobia is so, so real.”
After some initial grieving, 
both 
Qureshi 
and 
Fadlallah 
sprung into action to console the 
University Muslim community, 
also awash in fear and shock. 
Muslim Student Association orga-
nized a DPSS security presence 
for their upcoming Jumu’ah ser-
vice, the same Friday prayer that 
had been disrupted by the attacks 
in New Zealand.

The 29th annual Martin Luther 
King Jr. Health Sciences Lecture 
and Community Dialogue com-
menced this Wednesday at the 
University of Michigan School 
of Nursing. Entitled “Disparities 
Dialogue on Maternal Health and 
Care: Being a Black Woman Giv-
ing Birth in the U.S.: A Maternal 
Health Crisis,” the event focused 
on inequity in maternal health-
care. 
Approximately 100 people at-
tended the event, including stu-
dents, who made up a majority of 
the attendees, as well as faculty, 
staff, alums and community mem-
bers. The discussion was part of a 
series of held by the Martin Luther 
King Jr. Health Sciences Program 
with the purpose of improving eq-
uity in healthcare.
Dr. Lenette Jones, assistant pro-
fessor at the School of Nursing and 
one of the organizers of the event, 
said she hoped the conversation 
would provide a space for students 
to think critically with experts.
“I think for all the MLK events 
we had this year, we really had in 
mind the students,” Jones said.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

Our University was deeply 
affected by the traumatizing 
event of having a believed 
shooter on campus. While 
this was thankfully proven 
to be a false alarm, the stress, 
fear and harm inflicted on 
students 
remains 
tangibly 
real 
and 
potent. 
One 
of 
the 
fundamental 
reasons 
that this stress has been 
so pervasive lies with the 
University’s 
inadequate 
response to the alarm – 
particularly in its unclear 
and sporadic communication 
with students before and 
after 
the 
incident. 
This 
past weekend’s events were 
an alarming wake up call. 
We as an Editorial Board 
urge 
the 
University 
to 
take 
this 
opportunity 
to 
implement concrete change 
to 
their 
active 
shooter 
preparedness and procedure, 
in collaboration with student 
organizations to create the 
most 
effective 
protocol 
possible.
After 
an 
emergency, 
students look toward the 
University 
for 
leadership 
and guidance on how to 
effectively 
move 
forward. 
We implore the University 
to create a space for open 
dialogue 
for 
students 
to 
directly 
express 
their 
concerns about the current 
active shooter protocol as well 
as suggest amendments to the 
way the University handles 
emergency 
situations. 
This could be a town hall, 
among other options. This 
will give the University the 
opportunity to hear from and 
acknowledge how different 
communities — specifically 
underrepresented 
communities like the Muslim 
community and people with 
disabilities — are affected, 
and allow these different 
experiences to inform the 
resulting policy.
One of the most glaring 
issues to come from the 
incident was the University’s 
alert system. The system 
failed to notify all students 
of the alarm, either at all or 
in a timely manner, which 
is unacceptable considering 
that the immediate safety of 
the entire community was 
at risk. Students reported 
receiving information from 
their parents before getting 
any notification from the 
University or from social 
media. 
The 
University’s 
first 
alert 
regarding 
the 

unconfirmed reports of an 
active shooter went out at 
5:06 p.m., though many had 
been 
receiving 
texts 
and 
calls from fellow students 
and loved ones for about 30 
minutes beforehand. When 
the alert finally came, not all 
students received it through 
practical 
and 
immediate 
channels 
such 
as 
text 
message or push notification. 
The University should not 
only work to deliver these 
messages in a more timely 
fashion, but also make it 
mandatory for students to 
opt into the emergency text 
system, which is currently 
optional 
and 
accessible 
for students to sign up to 
through Wolverine Access.

It is also important for 
the University to reevaluate 
the type of information they 
are disseminating in these 
alerts, and focus on providing 
accurate, detailed and clear 
information. One of the first 
messages from the University 
simply said “run, hide, fight” 
— the University’s current 
active 
shooter 
protocol 
sponsored by the Department 
of Homeland Security. While 
this protocol may be useful, 
in an emergency situation 
it 
does 
not 
adequately 
provide students with useful 
direction. Furthermore, it 
fails to account for specifics 
of the situation.
Additionally, 
the 
“run, 
hide, 
fight” 
protocol 
is 
something 
that 
needs 
to 
be addressed and retaught 
beyond the video shown at 
orientation. Many students, 
faculty and staff are unaware 
of what exactly this protocol 
entails, which is problematic 
due 
to 
its 
importance. 
Potential solutions to this 
problem could be creating 
a simulation to be shown at 
more regular intervals, either 
during 
syllabus 
week 
or 
through mandatory seminars 
in the mold of “Relationship 
Remix” and “Change it Up.” 

Expanded-upon instruction 
about 
“run, 
hide, 
fight” 
could 
include 
situations 
that 
are 
personalized 
to 
our 
specific 
institution, 
perhaps including building-
by-building 
protocols 
— 
especially 
those 
that 
are 
frequently 
attended 
by 
students and therefore more 
vulnerable 
to 
potential 
emergency situations. This 
information could also be 
featured on course syllabi in 
a similar way that the sexual 
assault and CAPS policies are 
described, giving students 
specific information based 
on the building and room.
It is crucial that the 
University discuss which of 
their channels of information 
is 
most 
reliable 
so 
that 
students and the community 
at large are able to turn to a 
credible source immediately. 
If such a channel is not yet 
established then it is the 
University’s duty to create 
a clear source for reliable 
updates. We also encourage 
the University to collaborate 
with The Michigan Daily 
as a trusted campus news 
organization and resource, 
as we can serve as a direct 
pipeline 
of 
reliable 
and 
immediate information. We 
acknowledge the mistakes 
we made on Saturday, and 
to 
prevent 
anymore 
the 
University 
should 
work 
with us to provide accurate 
updates in the event of an 
emergency.
Due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
clear 
communication 
via 
emergency 
alerts, 
vague 
vocabulary and instructions 
and no single, clear source 
for updates, students turned 
to police scanners and first-
hand accounts about what 
was happening. This aided 
in the spread of confusion 
and panic. We are incredibly 
fortunate that the alert on 
Saturday was a false alarm, 
but this event must be viewed 
as a learning opportunity for 
the University to improve 
its emergency protocols. It 
is imperative that students, 
faculty and staff have a 
clearer 
understanding 
of 
what to do and where to 
receive information in these 
types of situations. Saturday 
proved there is an urgent 
need to improve University 
policy and protocol, as these 
procedures are essential to 
our campus safety.

B

y 4 p.m., more than 
200 of us arrived at the 
University of Michigan 
Diag for a vigil to mourn the lives 
of those lost in New Zealand, 
organized by the Islamophobia 
Working Group.
At about 4:35 p.m., 20 terrified 
people called 911 from Mason 
Hall, reporting the sound of 
gunshots.
At 4:43 p.m., I sent my loved 
ones a text message that read, 
“I’m okay I love you.”
The truth is I was not ok. I 
was not safe. And I didn’t know if 
this would be the last thing they 
would ever hear from me.
My day started off better than 
most. I attended the Women’s 
March with my mom and friends 
and then arrived at the vigil 
shortly after to support the Ann 
Arbor Muslim community. It 
was supposed to be a day that 
would uplift and unite us. At 
the vigil, a student beautifully 
chanted a verse from the Quran, 
the names of the victims were 
spoken aloud and another student 
began reading a poem. Suddenly 
I heard a man’s voice shouting in 
the distance, I turned my head 
back toward the noise but saw 
nothing and turned back to face 
the poet. I could not hear what 
he said or see the crowd behind 
me from where I was standing in 
the front. Seconds later his voice 
was echoed by screams and cries 
and people all around me were 
running for their lives. It was all a 
blur. It happened so slowly and so 
quickly at the same time.
Over the past year and a 
half, in light of the news of mass 
shootings in this country and 
abroad, I have woken up with 
night terrors where I am in a 
lockdown more times than I can 
count. But my nightmares did 
not prepare me for this. I found 
myself lying on the cement of the 
Diag. It felt like I was drowning 
in the sea of people and I didn’t 
have the strength to get up or the 
ability to see the surface.
I heard two voices, who I 
would later find out were my 
friends, telling me I needed to 
stand up. It sounded like when 
you’re sleeping and someone 
is talking to you and you can’t 
tell if it is in your dream or real 
life. I somehow managed to pull 
myself up; I probably wouldn’t 
have been able to if it were not 
for the encouraging voices. I 
remembered that it was safest to 
run as far away as possible from 
the shooter, but I didn’t have 
the strength to keep running. 
It felt like I was running in slow 
motion. In delirium, I reached for 

the nearest door handle and ran 
inside. I later found out that it was 
the Hatcher Graduate Library.
I don’t even remember how I 
found the staircase that led to “the 
stacks,” bookshelves of archived 
materials and locked office doors. 
There was no room to hide in, no 
door to lock. In the active shooter 
situations I had been trained 
for, there was a dark classroom 
with entrances that could be 
barricaded and people huddled in 
a corner whimpering quietly. This 
was far from my experience. Here 
I was in an all-concrete area with 
nothing to hide behind or block 
doors with. Fluorescent lights 
shined above us and daylight 
streamed through the windows. 
We were not “in hiding” because 
there was nowhere to hide. I 
saw the number four on a door 
and assumed I was on the fourth 
floor of the building. I did not feel 
like I was in lockdown, nothing 
felt secure or protected. Twenty 
minutes later, messages came 
through our phones that read 
“Active shooter in Mason Hall. 
Run, hide, fight.” Mason Hall was 
the building next to us. We had 
run long ago. We were not able 
to hide here. And we had nothing 
with which to fight. Helpless.
I was with about 10 others. 
Two happened to be my friends, 
even 
though 
we 
had 
been 
separated in the crowd, and the 
rest were strangers. A couple 
of them organized and spoke at 
the vigil. The oldest among us 
proposed we all sit in a circle, hold 
hands, and just breathe. My hands 
were clasped so tightly with the 
people next to me, my knuckles 
must have been white.
Over the next hour and a half, 
we all received text messages 
and calls from worried friends 
and family. Between Twitter, 
text 
messages 
and 
listening 
to the police scanner on our 
phones, countless rumors spread 
rapidly. We heard mixed reports, 
including “the shooter is in the 
library right now,” “they have 
caught two shooters and are 
looking for a third,” “the suspect 
is heading towards Brown Jug” 
and others. It was impossible 
to know what was true, as we 
received no concrete information 
from the University’s emergency 
alerts.
After nearly an hour of pacing, 
waiting and worrying, some other 
students found our group. They 
suggested we try to get to a higher 
floor, as we were only on the first 
floor – which was news to me. 
After finally getting to the top 
floor, we heard loud footsteps and 
a man’s voice shouting something, 

so we bolted back down the spiral 
staircase in a parade of terror 
(this was likely a police officer but 
we, of course, assumed it was a 
shooter).
We remained at the bottom 
of the staircase for the last 15 
minutes, all 40 of us at that point, 
while a series of announcements 
started coming on the intercom. 
A 
woman’s 
voice 
projected 
throughout the building that the 
library was safe and there were 
police here because the fire alarm 
had been triggered, though we 
never heard it go off. The next 
announcement reported that it 
was safe outside and we could 
choose whether to leave or not. 
The final one said that the police 
declared everyone must vacate 
the building so they could clear 
it. We did not know whether to 
trust the voice overhead. These 
announcements spread to social 
media and I received texts from 
worried 
friends 
saying 
that 
what the woman was saying 
contradicted police orders.
When we finally got the “all 
clear” message, we cautiously 
got up to exit the staircase. The 
emergency alarm went off as we 
opened the exterior door. Some 
hesitated, while others said to 
keep going. Once outside in the 
brisk, open air, there was a police 
officer positioned between us and 
the road. He wore a bulletproof 
vest and dark sunglasses. The 
officer sharply motioned for us to 
stop walking toward him and to go 
in a different direction. Bright red 
and blue lights lining the Diag faded 
behind us. We continued to walk 
home, unsure if we were safe yet. 
Local news declared that the active 
shooter was a false alarm caused 
by popping balloons, assumed to 
be gunshots, prompting police to 
tell the crowd at the vigil to run. I 
received many texts from relieved 
friends and family to the effect of 
“at least it wasn’t real,” completely 
invalidating my lived experience.
When I got home I peeled off 
my muddy jeans to reveal two 
badly bruised and scraped knees. 
I feel grateful for the condition 
of my knees. Grateful for these 
knees that sting with each step 
I take back into normalcy. I am 
grateful for them because they 
prove, to others and myself, 
that I survived a very real active 
shooter experience. That for an 
hour and a half I did not know if 
I would make it to see today.

False alarm

ASHLEY SCHNAAR | OP-ED

B

ig 
Brother? 
Or 
a 
breakthrough in crime 
fighting? 
Detroit 
has 
joined the growing list of cities 
turning to surveillance cameras 
as a tactic in their efforts to reduce 
crime.
Project Green Light allows 
businesses to pay a fee to have 
surveillance 
cameras 
stream 
directly into city police facilities. 
Police monitor the footage, aiming 
to catch crime in real-time as well 
as using it to track down and arrest 
suspects. The program has been 
touted by Detroit Mayor Mike 
Duggan as a major factor in the 
city’s recent crime reduction. He 
has used that momentum to push 
for a major expansion of Project 
Green 
Light, 
which 
includes 
integrating traffic cameras as well 
as schools with the 500 businesses 
currently providing surveillance 
footage. 
Duggan 
has 
also 
entertained making the program 
mandatory for businesses open at 
10 p.m.
Does Project Green Light 
actually 
reduce 
crime? 
It’s 
unclear. City officials say yes, 
pointing to a number of statistics 
including crime falling by 11 
percent at Green Light locations 
from 2016 to 2017 (the city as a 
whole saw a 7 percent decrease in 
crime over the same time period). 
However, no robust study has 
been done comparing crime at 
Green Light and non-Green Light 
locations, and critics, such as Eric 
Williams of the ACLU, say the 
data presented by city officials is 
anecdotal. Furthermore, similar 
projects in Baltimore, Chicago 
and Washington D.C. have seen 
benefits diminish as the programs 
expanded. London, often cited 
as the most surveilled city in the 
world, has seen no significant 

reduction in crime since the large-
scale rollout of its camera system.
The 
trend 
towards 
surveillance as a crime-fighting 
strategy 
isn’t 
confined 
to 
government. A number of startups 
have arisen claiming to provide 
protection for homeowners with 
“smart” video doorbells. One 
of the largest such companies, 
Ring, was recently acquired by 
Amazon for $1 billion. However, 
just as with city-wide studies, 
the effectiveness of home video 
doorbells is unclear, with some 
studies finding that areas with 
Ring doorbells saw increased 
crime compared to similar areas 
without them.
If surveillance programs do 
work, it’s only when they are 
implemented in a small, targeted 
way according to Eric Piza, an 
associate professor at the John Jay 
College of Criminal Justice. When 
programs become too big, studies 
have shown residents begin to 
believe police are not consistently 
monitoring the cameras. So, by 
expanding Project Green Light, 
Detroit may eliminate any positive 
effects of the program.
Putting its effects on crime 
aside, 
what 
does 
increased 
surveillance mean for people’s 
privacy 
and 
civil 
liberties? 
Nothing good. Project Green 
Light’s combination of traffic 
cameras and business footage 
potentially opens the door for 
tracking 
citizens 
across 
the 
city. As people travel, inevitably 
passing businesses and traffic 
lights, police will amass data that 
could allow them to connect the 
dots on an individual’s movement 
with relative ease. China is already 
doing this, using a vast network 
of cameras to track Xinjiang 
residents.

Additionally, 
the 
use 
of 
facial recognition software to 
identify persons of interest could 
lead to misidentifications with 
potentially serious consequences 
— like when an FBI examiner 
using 
facial 
recognition 
technology incorrectly identified 
a bank robber. The ACLU tested 
Amazon’s 
facial 
recognition 
software, Rekognition (currently 
in use by a number of police 
departments), on members of 
Congress and found it matched 
28 of them — disproportionately 
people of color — to criminal 
mugshots. This finding which 
begs the question: Should a tool 
which perpetuates biases already 
plaguing the criminal justice 
system be used by it?
Detroit’s push to expand 
Project Green Light is in stark 
contrast 
to 
the 
ambiguity 
surrounding its effects. Millions 
of dollars in taxpayer money 
have been allocated to the 
program along with the typical 
$4,000 fee each business pays 
to install cameras. That’s money 
that could be spent on strategies 
that are proven to reduce crime 
such as community policing 
and better lighting, not to 
mention employment, housing, 
education 
and 
recreation 
programs. Instead of treating 
the root causes of crime, city 
officials are pouring money 
into an unproven quick-fix that 
opens the door for privacy and 
civil liberty abuses. Preventing 
crime should be about lifting 
people up, not targeting them 
with a dubious surveillance 
program 
whose 
effects 
are 
likely inconsequential.

Project Green Light’s end doesn’t justify the means

FROM THE DAILY

The University’s emergency response system needs improvement 
T

his past Saturday, there was a false alarm during which University 
of Michigan students were alerted about an active shooter situation 
in Mason Hall, leaving them confused, fearful and traumatized. 
This occurred at the same time as a vigil on the Diag for the victims of the 
recent attacks on two New Zealand mosques, where more than 50 people 
were killed. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board would like to specifically 
express our support for the Muslim community during this time, many of 
whom were disproportionately affected by this scare, and offer a statement 
of solidarity with the community.

The system failed 
to notify all 
students of the 
alarm, either at

Until I installed an Apple 
TV, I was never into YouTube. 
Sure, every now and then, 
I turned to the platform to 
find an obscure song or clip 
of celebrity fights, but I was 
nowhere near familiar enough 
to recognize its burgeoning 
class of celebrity vloggers 
and personalities. Speaking 
candidly, I had no desire to. 
Although 
these 
YouTubers 
were known, in my snobbish 
fame-traditionalist eyes, they 
were not real celebrities.
It wasn’t until I learned 
that the same YouTubers I had 
written off as low-brow were 
not only amassing legions 
of fans, but also raking in 
millions of dollars that I began 
to feel ... behind the times. Is 
this how people who doubted 
the rise of the automobile 
felt? As a self-anointed pop 
culture connoisseur, this was 
unfamiliar territory. Normally, 
I am ahead of the tide or right 
on the money in predicting 
the 
rise 
of 
celebrities. 
I 
soon realized I could only 
track 
star-making 
along 
the pathways I was already 
familiar with: A reality show, 
a popular song, a breakout 
role in a successful movie, 
a promotion from recurring 
cast to main cast, a move from 
the center, human interest 
section of People Magazine 
to the cover, etc. Now, with 
celebrities 
materializing 
seemingly out of thin air, my 
proven theories couldn’t be 
applied the same way. I had no 
algorithm to explain the rise 
of a Vine star, or even more 
difficult, a former “Dance 
Moms” star. What was a David 
Dobrik? A Tana Mongeau? 
A Shane Dawson? A James 
Charles? A Hannah Meloche?
As much as I wanted to 
immerse myself in the culture 
of my contemporaries, I was 
too late. Alas, YouTube culture 
had already taken off without 
me. There were already eras 
I had not experienced, long-
standing beefs I didn’t have 
enough context to pick a side 
on. I could never catch up. It 
was as bad as downloading 
Twitter post-2014.
But then ... I met friends 
who were not puzzled by the 
Internet, and my whole world 
changed.
Through 
my 
YouTube-
savvy 
friends, 
I 
received 
a 
crash 
course 
in 
the 
platform’s teenage subculture 
(Disclaimer: 
I 
am 
just 
a 
19-year-old that is bad with 
technology, I am not a 45-year-
old Breitbart employee). It 
did not take long for me to 
associate the no-filter, low-
quality, high stakes drama of 
vlogger world with the age 
of early reality television — 
before the interfering hand 
of networks and producers 
left even the juiciest shows 
feeling scripted and flat. The 
world of YouTube provided 
a 
perfect 
hate-watching 
substitute, and I was hooked. 
Within 
a 
few 
months, 
I 
was able to detect that, like 
Hollywood, this world also 
came with clear hierarchies 
of clout and resultant power 
dynamics. I knew that A-list 

star David Dobrik and his 
“Vlog Squad” doing a video 
with 
everyone’s 
favorite 
fraud, Olivia Jade — a former 
C-lister — meant her come-
up was drawing nigh. Falling 
star James Charles beginning 
a collaboration squad with 
consistent fan favorites, the 
Dolan 
Twins, 
meant 
that 
he was trying to salvage 
whatever is left of his waning 
popularity. Most importantly, 
I was able to correctly infer 
that the undisputed queen of 
teenage YouTube is Emma 
Chamberlain.
If the 17-year-old’s name is 
unfamiliar to you, you are not 
alone. However, as I learned 
the hard way, it would be 
naive to write off her presence 
simply because she is most 
popular with teenagers too 
edgy to like “Riverdale.” The 
scope of her influence in 
YouTube culture is evidenced 
in widespread attempts of 
wannabe vloggers to imitate 
everything about her — from 
her unique editing style, to 
her dry sense of humor and 
of course, her unmistakable 
style. 
Chamberlain 
could 
be 
considered 
responsible 
for popularizing the Urban 
Outfitters 
“aesthetic” 
(teddy 
jacket, 
mom 
jeans, 
scrunchie, 
messy 
ponytail) 
for the younger population of 
Generation Z. She is rumored 
to be one-half of a power 
couple with other massively 
popular 
YouTuber, 
Ethan 
Dolan. Every vlogger wants to 
collaborate with her, few are 
able to.
Despite my usual aversion 
towards anyone revered by 
eighth graders, I found myself 
to be endeared and entertained 
by Chamberlain’s videos. She’s 
charming. She’s effortlessly 
cool. She’s real. It soon became 
clear 
that 
I 
was 
bearing 
witness to the rise of a new 
“It” girl. Yet, I had to question: 
How “It” could she truly be 
if she did not attain fame by 
traditional means? She was 
not an actress, not a model, not 
a singer, not an heiress and not 
the spawn of someone already 
famous. Could she ever garner 
the respect of the high brow 
that is intrinsic to “It” girl 
status? Would the day ever 
come when Anna Wintour 
gives Emma Chamberlain her 
seal of approval?
Of all the potential moments 
to experience an epiphany, it 
seems right that I experienced 
mine during Chamberlain’s 
awkward collaboration with 
none other than the laughing 
stock/overlord of the internet, 
Jojo Siwa. In the midst of an 
uncomfortable 
Jojo-themed 
makeover, in her signature 
self-deprecating 
manner, 
Chamberlain 
makes 
the 
joke that, in her comically 
oversized Jojo brand bow, she 
could definitely see herself 
being on the cover of Vogue. 
And although purely a joke 
in Emma’s eyes, when my 
friends and I paused the video 
on the doctored Vogue cover 
Emma inserted into the video, 
I could not help but see the 
fake cover as a premonition. 
A Vogue cover pretty much is 
the “golden ticket” to status. 
My friend said it best: “Give it 
five years.”
Initially, I had my doubts 

about 
the 
reality 
of 
her 
ascent to “It” girl status from 
YouTube — would enough 
people know who she is to 
concretely bestow her with 
this title? When you yourself 
are immersed in only YouTube 
for a while, it is easy to lose 
sight the scale of a YouTuber’s 
fame relative to established 
celebrity culture. The biggest 
YouTuber will still be smaller 
than the biggest name in 
Hollywood. To put things in 
perspective, consider the fact 
that while Emma has over 
seven million subscribers, she 
still does not have a Wikipedia 
page — many adults’ mental 
prerequisite for “real” fame. 
Adults 
are 
still, 
in 
many 
ways, 
gatekeepers 
to 
who 
can be considered a bona fide 
celebrity. Unlike the stars in 
the Nickelodeon and Disney 
machine, 
Emma 
does 
not 
have to bow to management 
and participate in synergy-
motivated daytime talk show 
appearances 
wherein 
her 
name and image is dispered to 
a middle-aged audience.
The 
possibility 
of 
the 
hypothetical 
Emma 
Chamberlain 
Vogue 
cover 
began to feel all the more real 
when I considered the fact 
that Chamberlain already has 
begun to capitalize on her 
influence with a successful 
clothing line inspired by her 
own looks. From there, the 
possibilities for her rise are 
limitless. Will she continue on 
the path of couture a la Mary 
Kate and Ashley Olsen? Will 
she expand her vlogs into a 
larger lifestyle brand? With 
print journalism clinging onto 
relevancy, it is not far-fetched 
to predict that some struggling 
Conde 
Nast 
publication 
will bring her aboard in a 
titleless 
“creative” 
position 
in order to nab the younger 
generation of readers. Emma 
Chamberlain will be the face 
that 
legitimizes 
YouTube 
celebrity. It’s only a matter of 
time before her brand evolves 
from trendy teen to chic street 
style, and that dear reader, is 
when you can send me a letter 
confirming that I told you so.
It is important to remember 
that one does not necessarily 
need to be mainstream to 
reach “It” status. In fact, 
mainstream 
recognizability 
could 
even 
be 
considered 
detrimental. It makes said 
star “safe.” True “It” girls 
have always retained an aura 
of cutting-edge alternativity 
that distinguishes them from 
“America’s 
Sweethearts” 
— the more palatable of the 
women we place on pedestals. 
Chamberlain’s 
avoidance 
of network and corporation 
control has given her an edge 
that the network girls cannot 
compete with: She can curse, 
she can talk about sex, she 
can be seen publicly with no 
makeup, etc. There are no 
consequences. Even without 
the assistance of a larger brand, 
she has been able to influence 
an entire sub-generation. She 
is her own management. I must 
question, in a few years, when 
Emma makes her inevitable 
rise to the top, will her victory 
signal entry into a new era of 
celebrity 
where 
YouTubers 
have a legitimate seat at the 
table?

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: 
‘SALLY WALKER’

Iggy Azalea’s long and 
illustrious career has been 
plagued by accusations of 
cultural 
appropriation 
as 
well as a perceived lack 
of 
artistic 
talent. 
These 
accusations are both very 
true, and she continues to 
prove them correct in her 
recently released video for 
her single “Sally Walker.” 
To summarize the video, 
it depicts Azalea rapping 
and 
generally 
looking 
good at the funeral of a 
woman 
— 
presumably 
one 
of 
her 
haters 
she 
discusses in the song —
who was hit by a car. This 
video, much like Azalea’s 
entire discography, is a 
simulacrum 
of 
Southern 
Black 
hip-hop 
culture 
bordering on caricature — a 
three-minute, 
eight-second 
span devoid of any originality 
or meaning.
The video does not do 
much to reassure viewers 

that Azalea has learned from 
her past lack of consideration 
to the space she occupies as 
a white person within the 
hip-hop 
community, 
even 
after being admonished by 
both Q-Tip and Talib Kweli 

for her flippant responses to 
valid concerns. Instead, she 
continues with her long-time 
strategy of creating ersatz, 
disrespectful 
garbage. 
You have to respect her 
dedication.
The song itself is bland 

and uninspiring, sounding 
less like a piece of artistic 
expression and more like 
the miserable output of a 
machine learning algorithm 
fed the last few years of 
chart-topping Southern hip 
hop. The lyrical focus of 
“Sally Walker” is on how 
great she is, a promise she 
has been making and failing 
to deliver for almost half a 
decade. I will give her credit 
where it is due — she is a 
competent thief. However, 
the studied nature of her 
imitation 
almost 
makes 
her cultural biting more 
egregious. 
Outside 
of 
a 
careful 
re-creation, 
she 
doesn’t really have much to 
bring to the table, and this 
video proves that.

DEF JAM

Nadia Boulanger, the famous 
20th-century Parisian music 
pedagogue, was once asked how 
she determined if she would 
accept a potential student into 
her studio. At this point, she 
was the most famous music 
composition 
instructor 
in 
the world, and students were 
flocking to her home in hopes 
of 
studying 
with 
her. 
She 
explained that she asks every 
student if they could imagine 
living 
without 
music. 
She 
would only accept those into 
her studio who could not live 
without music — she wanted 
people willing to dedicate their 
lives to it.
While 
an 
undergraduate 
music student here at the 
University, I have had many 
professors speak to me about 
this mystical power of music. 
I’ve been told of the power of 
music to bring people together, 
to allow them to overcome their 
prejudices and understand each 
other on a more human level. 
I’ve heard the stories of sick 
people cured by music, of armies 
on the brink of war brought 
together through music.
But though I have frequently 
heard of this power, I’ve never 
understood it myself. I love 
music — both creating it and 
listening to it — and I can think 
of nothing that I would rather 
spend the rest of my life doing. 
But I’ve also always believed 
that I could live without it. 
Though it is beautiful, it is not 
essential.
Music, after all, is a form 
of 
entertainment. 
It 
can 
be 
incredibly 
moving 
and 
immensely powerful, but it is 
tangibly meaningless; vibrating 
air 
columns 
provoking 
sympathetic vibrations in our 
inner ear canal. It has no ability 
to substantially change the 
world around us; it can only 
change the world we hold inside 
us.
So as I’ve often asked myself, 
could I live without music? The 
events of this past weekend 
forced me to reconsider this 
question and the answer that 
I’ve long held to it. It is not 
a question of biology, I now 
understand, but a question of 
humanity. Boulanger is not 
asking if I could sustain my own 

life without music, but rather 
if I would lose some of my 
humanity if I lost music.
To explain how I reached 
this conclusion, I first must 
relate my experience of the 
active shooter alert from this 
past Saturday. I play bass in the 
Jazz Trombone Ensemble and 
the Jazz Trombone Quintet. 
We had a concert on Saturday 
between 4:45 and 5:15 — right in 
the middle of the crisis.
The concert was in the Moore 
Building up on North Campus, 

far away from the scene of the 
alleged crisis. In the minutes 
before we walked on stage, a 
few members of the Trombone 
Ensemble 
began 
receiving 
messages from friends about 
people running from the Diag. 
(Others had no idea what was 
going on, and they would not 
learn what was going on until 
after we performed.)
At first, those of us that were 
aware of the situation struggled 
with whether we should tell our 
bandmates and our professor. 
But the University’s official 
alert about this had not come 
out yet — we had no indication 
that the University considered 
this threat to be legitimate.
As I made eye-contact with 
a friend shortly before we both 
went on stage, I could tell that 
he had also gotten messages 
about what was going on. We 
were both scared, concerned 
and 
horrified. 
Should 
we 
continue to go on stage at this 
point? Was it appropriate for us 
to continue making music in the 
face of this potential tragedy?
I wavered a bit, unsure 
whether 
I 
could 
possibly 

continue to perform in the face 
of this potential tragedy. My 
friend, however, took a minute 
to gather himself before striding 
confidently onto the stage.
After five or 10 more seconds 
of indecision, I realized that 
I had to go out and perform 
as well. This was no longer a 
performance for class credit 
or 
performance 
experience. 
This concert was a means of 
expressing my thoughts in a 
manner that words would not 
allow — the only means I knew 
of to express how I felt about 
this alert.
For the first time in my life, 
I understood the incredible 
power of music. At the same 
time, I understood why music 
was so vital to my life, why 
there was absolutely no means 
by which I could ever live 
without music. In this moment, 
the abstract power of music was 
not a weakness; it was a virtue.
I was reminded of Leonard 
Bernstein’s famous quote on 
the role of music in troubling 
times. “This will be our reply to 
violence: To make music more 
intensely, 
more 
beautifully, 
more 
devotedly 
than 
ever 
before.”
I had always interpreted this 
quote to be an idealistic act of 
defiance. Making music was 
a means of proving to those 
who committed violence that 
they had not “won” — they 
had not scared musicians from 
continuing to make music and 
share with others.
But I now understand that 
this quote is not about defiance. 
It is about the awesome power 
of music. It is about the power 
to create connections between 
people. It is about the power to 
express in sound what cannot 
be expressed in words. And 
it is about the power to affect 
people’s emotions, to connect 
with 
them, 
share 
complex 
emotions 
with 
them 
and 
luxuriate in the beauty of this 
connection.
This is the power of music 
that all my professors have 
spoken about. This is the power 
that I never understood. And 
this is the power that Boulanger 
was asking her students about — 
the power that she believed we 
could not live without.

How many Italian words do 
you know?
If you’re like me, the total 
probably caps out at a stunning 
two: 
“ciao” 
and 
“rigatoni.” 
But you might know another 
without even thinking about it: 
“Consigliere.” It’s a term that we 
are so intimately familiar with, it 
appears in political and financial 
headlines with healthy regularity. 
Consigliere, of course, refers to 
the second highest position in an 
organization, a murky backroom 
advisor of sorts. And the reason 
we are all so familiar with the 
term is one film: “The Godfather.”
There 
are 
several 
more 
Godfatherisms, pieces of the 
film’s narrative language that we 
have naturally embedded into the 
American lexicon. These lingual 
appendages are a testament to the 
influence that “The Godfather” 
has 
on 
our 
vocabulary, 
as 
pervasive as they are persistent.
Among 
my 
favorite 
Godfatherisms is “going to the 
mattresses,” a tactic of mafia 
soldiers to prepare for factional 
wars by stuffing dozens of 
mattresses in a single apartment 
like a military base. The phrase 
now refers to a ramping up of 
political tensions, the pregnant 
stretch just before a cutthroat 
conflict. Inarguably though, the 
most iconic Godfatherism is the 
concept of Fredo. Fredo is the 
eldest, weakest and most naive of 
the sons of the Corleone family, 
but he lives on in the way we 
discuss any trio and its weakest 
link.
So much has been said about the 
sprawling epic of Vito Corleone 
and his mafia powerhouse that it 

would be pointless to heap more 
praise for Francis Ford Coppola’s 
masterpiece on the mountain of 
it that has accumulated over the 
past 47 years. Instead, much like 
I did for my first installment of 
this series with “The Departed,” 
I’ll be taking a thorough look at 
several characters in the film 
to decipher what they signify 
about culture and its intersection 
with organized crime. Beyond 
the Godfatherisms that have 
employed themselves in political 
and business dialogue, the key 
players in the film have become 
avatars for a shared yet conflicted 
sense of American identity.
While both “The Departed” 
and “The Godfather” anatomize 
organized 
crime 
in 
morally 
ambiguous ways, the relationship 
they have to each other regarding 
ethnicity 
is 
certainly 
worth 
considering. 
“The 
Departed” 
is 
primarily 
and 
proudly 
comprised of Irish characters, 
but in “The Godfather,” the few 
Irish characters stick out like 
sore thumbs among the Sicilians 
around them.
Among the most fascinating 
aspects of what “The Godfather” 
has to say about cultural shift 
manifests in Vito’s sons Michael 
and Sonny. The story subtly 
employs these two characters 
as vehicles to tell a far larger 
narrative about American values 
after World War II, and each time 
I return to the film, their arcs 
have a renewed weight.
There is something gravely 
profound 
about 
Michael’s 
transition from an adorned World 
War II veteran to the Don of the 
Corleone crime family. When 
he first greets his relatives after 
returning from the war during 
his sister Connie’s wedding, he 
is a shining, humble hero. His 

smile is bright, his military suit is 
decorated lavishly with medals, 
and his arrival is a delight 
within the ongoing celebration. 
Michael’s 
reception 
largely 
mirrors society’s adoration of the 
American war hero in the late 
‘40s.
The tragedy is that his turn 
to the criminal underworld is 
catalyzed by the simple act of 
protecting his father in a derelict 
hospital. After a corrupt Irish 
captain, 
McCluskey, 
strikes 
him across the face on the night 
of his father’s abandonment, 
Michael realizes — much like 
the post-war society did — that 
the institutions he had clung to 
and believed in were corrupt 
and unjust. This sudden loss of 
faith in the government that he 
had once fought for shakes his 
entire worldview and disposition. 
The film considers this idea in 
its very first scene, when Vito 
actually reprimands a friend, 
Amerigo Bonasera, for seeking 
justice in courts rather than the 
Corleone family. But McCluskey’s 
brutal hook across Michael’s jaw 
represents the violent realization 
of distrust in the government by 
the film’s initially pristine war 
hero.
Michael’s descent into a world 
of corruption mirrors a broader 
shift in proud American stories 
about cowboys and soldiers to 
a darker acceptance of crime 
and moral confusion. Naturally, 
this 
crumbling 
of 
moral 
superiority parallels the rise of 
counterculture in the ’60s, the 
uproar of political descent that 
rattled American discourse like 
nothing else had.

BITCH (takes one to know one)

Lennon Stella

Capitol Records

SINGLE REVIEW: 
‘BITCH (TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE)’

It’s a loaded word, and 
lots of us have been called it 
— in good contexts and bad. 
Lennon Stella inverts, twists 
and wields it on expert levels 
with her new single “BITCH 
(takes one to know one).”
Along 
with 
her 
sister 
Maisy, Stella is one-half of 
the musical duo 
Lennon & Maisy, 
but 
the 
past 
couple of years 
have 
seen 
her 
refocusing on her 
own solo projects. 
Her 
newest 
single 
opens 
with a boyfriend 
jokingly 
calling 
his 
girlfriend 
the 
derogatory 
word, forcing her into a 
position of weakness: “You 
sent me down the river to 
see if I would float away.” 
But she doesn’t float away: 
She speaks the word aloud in 
the chorus and turns it on its 

heel, proclaiming, “It takes a 
bitch to know a bitch.”
It’s a masterful move to 
affirm your own position 
and put down your horrible 
boyfriend in the fell swoop of 
a single world, but that’s what 
Stella does. It’s a concept she 
returns to time and time 

again — most notably in the 
bridge lyric, “You should 
hear the way you talk to me.” 
She’s literally making him 
hear it. But “BITCH (takes 
one to know one)” is a head-
turning song even beyond its 

lyrical cleverness, boasting 
a catchy hook and a chorus 
that sounds jubilant, fun 
and just the right amount of 
gloating. It’s Ariana Grande-
style pop, too even-handed to 
be a rant, vocally melodic in a 
way that elevates Stella miles 
above the level of the man 
she’s addressing. 
She’s 
in 
touch 
with the betrayal 
and hurt that she 
feels, 
but 
also 
with 
her 
own 
authority 
and 
ability to dictate 
the relationship 
she’s 
in. 
The 
real triumph in 
the song is that 
these 
emotions 
all come through on equal 
levels, each one validated 
and accounted for.

“It sounds like hope is kind of a 
risk that you take?” I asked.
“That’s exactly what I said at 
the talk,” she answered. I was 
seated across from Detroit-based 
writer and teacher at the College 
for 
Creative 
Studies 
Dorene 
O’Brien, speaking with her about 
the themes of her latest release, a 
collection of fiction called “What 
It Might Feel Like to Hope.” She 
continued, “I think that a lot 
of us suppress hope to defray 
disappointment,” adding that “We 
have to accept that failure is going 
to be a common thing and not let it 
destroy any inkling of hope.”
If I had to describe O’Brien in 
three words, I’d borrow from one 
of the most stunning moments 
of “What It Might Feel Like to 
Hope.” In it, Jack and Braelynn, a 
couple approaching an impasse in 
their relationship, take a road trip 
to symbolically test whether they 
will make it. During a spontaneous 
stop at a candy factory, they gaze 
upon the conveyor belts of sweets 
below. A young boy who is also 
touring the factory unthinkingly 
reaches up and takes Jack’s hand, 
who is caught off guard by the 
“easy, unconscious grace” of the 
boy’s unquestioning expectation 
that his real parent would be there 
to catch his hand. Having had 
the pleasure of both reading and 
meeting O’Brien, I’ve witnessed 
her own easy, unconscious grace, 
penning stories that hum with 
a delicate hope and emitting a 
gentle aura that corroborates her 
work.
Honoring the influence of 
other writers on her current 
work, O’Brien mentioned Andrea 
Barrett, 
explaining, 
“(Barrett) 
introduced me to the idea of 
quietly educating people in my 
writing. My favorite stories are 
the ones where I learn something 
I didn’t expect to learn.”
O’Brien sees something more, 
however, in the task of the writer, 
something that resides in her 
rich, lively dialogue and her 
ability to channel distinct voices. 
I delighted at this prioritization of 
character’s voices in every story, 
and when I asked O’Brien about it, 
she relayed an anecdote: “Every 

creative writing workshop I teach, 
the first day of class, I ask students 
if they hear voices in their head, 
and I joke that half of them raise 
their hands, and the other half 
drops the class.” Then, answering 
her own question, O’Brien added, 
“Most of my stories start with my 
characters talking to me. I think 
of someone and they start talking 
… It’s my job,” she continued, “to 
write these stories and channel 
the voices that come through 
me.” When she said that, I could 
not help but think of Arundhati 
Roy’s meditation on the duties of 
a storyteller: “Writers imagine 
that they cull stories from the 
world. I’m beginning to believe 
that vanity makes them think so. 
That it’s actually the other way 
around. Stories cull writers from 
the world … They commission us. 
They insist on being told.”
As O’Brien indicates in the 
anecdote above, teaching is also 
part of her professional endeavors. 
And I could tell she’s a teacher 
from the way she would answer 
my questions, from the way 
she would take them seriously, 
answer them methodically and 
even thank me for them. “I love 
talking to people about this,” she 
told me, “hearing the things that 
you’re saying. You may think I 
know all these things, and I don’t 
… You’re giving me a lot of insights 
that I didn’t consciously set out to 
do.”
In her stories, too, she invests 
in mutual learning in the form of 
intergenerational 
relationships, 
harvesting them as sites of growth 
for both generations involved. 
“We don’t live in generational 
bubbles. I think it’s so important 
that generations feed off one 
another — they learn from one 
another,” she began. “I’ve been 
writing for more than 30 years, 
and I’m still learning. I’m still 
growing. I think it’s a long, long 
apprenticeship. Any writer who 
says, ‘… I’m a full-blown writer,’ 
I think that’s a little arrogant 
because it’s an evolving practice … 
How can you say I’m a writer and 
I learned everything I’ve got to 
learn if the field is just constantly 
evolving?”
More than anything, it is 
impossible 
not 
to 
see 
how 
carefully O’Brien regards her 
position as a writer, how she 

does not take any of her power or 
talent for granted. In fact, while 
speaking with O’Brien, I finally 
got the chance to ask a question 
that nags me every time an author 
kills off a character in what seems 
like vain and what feels like 
emotional manipulation of the 
reader.
I asked for her thoughts on 
what a writer, for lack of a better 
word, owes not only their readers 
but also their characters. In 
response, she discussed at length 
one of the stories in the collection 
called “turn of the wind,” in 
which the main character, an 
aging 
crystallographer, 
tries 
to make connections and do 
meaningful work as Alzheimer’s 
seizes his memories. O’Brien 
discussed her difficulties with 
honoring that character: “Where 
I did him a great disservice was, 
he had Alzheimer’s, so … very 
conveniently, when I needed him 
to forget something, he would just 
forget. But then, when I needed 
him to be lucid, he would be lucid. 
And I realized that he is just a 
prop in my plot,” she admitted. 
O’Brien then relayed how she 
redressed this treatment of her 
character: “I had to do a lot of 
research on Alzheimer’s. That’s 
what he deserved. That’s what 
my character deserved. And that’s 
what my readers deserved as well. 
Because I’m the one saying I want 
to quietly educate readers, and 
I’m misleading them.”
In this instance and virtually 
every other one that gave O’Brien 
the chance to speak about her 
characters, she spoke about them 
as though they are her neighbors, 
her old friends. People that trust 
her, and people whose trust she 
would not dare squander. She 
treated me in a similar, heartening 
way: Like I’m a real person who 
wants to talk to her and not just 
a journalist with a recording 
device. I have a hunch she regards 
her students in the same way: Like 
they are real people in the desks 
before her with valuable stories to 
learn to tell.
In her writing but in our 
conversation, too, Dorene O’Brien 
quietly educated me on what it 
means to be a writer and on what 
it means to cull stories from the 
world. It was a privilege to have 
culled hers, here.

AUTHOR INTERVIEW


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Sports
Thursday, March 21, 2019 — 7

In recent years, the Michigan baseball 

team has seen both highs and lows. Even 
with a record of 111-59 over the past three 
years, only two of those wins came in 
postseason games. 

Last season, despite a thrilling 

20-game win streak, the Wolverines 
were eliminated from the Big Ten 
Tournament with only one victory and 
failed to clinch an NCAA Tournament 
spot. 

This inability to break through in 

the past, however, has motivated this 
year’s team to strive toward making 
a deep run in the postseason. With 
improved offensive strength and an ideal 
combination of youth and experience, 
expectations are high. And as of now No. 
23 Michigan is the only ranked team in 
the conference. The Daily takes a look at 
the other teams in the Big Ten and those 
who could potentially pose a threat to the 
Wolverines.

Minnesota (5-13)
After their euphoric 2018 season, 

the Golden Gophers placed first in 
the 2019 Big Ten preseason poll of 
conference coaches. Last year the team 
posted a 44-15 record, winning the Big 
Ten Tournament and advancing to 
NCAA Super Regionals. Despite those 
achievements, however, Minnesota has 
had a rocky start to its season, and it 
remains to be seen whether the Golden 
Gophers can reclaim last year’s magic.

Player to watch: Sophomore Outfielder/

Right-hander Max Meyer

Meyer competed for the USA Baseball 

Collegiate National Team last summer, 
bringing his strengths as a two-way 
player. He boasts a .333 batting average 
and an equally strong 1.17 ERA so far.

Illinois (14-3)
Illinois has had a strong start to its 

season and has high expectations after 
making it to the semifinals in the Big Ten 
Tournament, just missing the NCAA 
Tournament field as the second team 
out. While they are reckoning with the 
loss of Big Ten Player of the Year Bren 
Spillane as well as reliable closer Joey 
Gerber, the future looks promising 

with a D1Baseball.com Top 25-ranked 
recruiting class. Keep an eye on the 
Fighting Illini.

Player to watch: Freshman Right-

hander Aidan Maldonado

Maldonado — ranked the No. 4 

newcomer in the Big Ten by Baseball 
America and drafted in the 38th round 
of the 2018 MLB draft by the Milwaukee 
Brewers — promises to deliver an impact 
on the mound but has yet to be heavily 
utilized by the team, with only eight 
innings pitched in five games.

Iowa (10-7) 
The Hawkeyes, who were on the 

NCAA Tournament bubble last year, lost 
their top four hitters in the offseason. The 
team has endured significant losses since 
its 2017 run to NCAA Regionals, with 
only three offensive starters remaining 
from two years ago. The overhauled 
team has exhibited some strengths 
which were on display in its two wins 
against California State Northridge –– 
who bested the Wolverines during their 
swing through California earlier this 
month. But with so many key offensive 
players missing, Iowa will find it difficult 
to replicate what it’s done in the past.

Player to watch: Junior Right-hander 

Grant Judkins

Judkins, with a 1.52 ERA, has had a 

strong season so far and was key in the 
Hawkeyes’ doubleheader victories over 
Cal State, even demonstrating an ability 
to contribute at the plate with a two-run 
double to win the second game.

Penn State (13-3)
The Nittany Lions posted an abysmal 

15-34 record last season and an even 
worse Big Ten record. Their relatively 
strong start this year has thus been a 
pleasant surprise for a team almost 
completely excluded from preseason 
prognostications. The offseason saw a 
lot of turnover and the team has added 
seven freshmen, a sophomore and four 
upperclassmen transfers to the lineup, 
who the coaching staff hopes will shift 
things in another direction. Despite its 
strong start, resetting a team can be 
a long process, and Penn State likely 
poses little threat to the conference 
heavyweights.

Player to watch: Junior second baseman 

Gavin Homer

Homer, a transfer from Kellogg 

Community College and part of the 
team’s attempt to reinvigorate its offense, 
hit a .386 batting average last season and 
promises to add more offensive efficiency 
to the lineup.

Indiana (12-8)
The Hoosiers have only missed out 

on one NCAA Tournament berth over 
the six years since their College World 
Series appearance in 2013 and have 
been a consistent regional presence in 
the conference. Their performance so 
far this season –– the first under new 
manager Jeff Mercer –– however, has 
been anything but consistent. In the 
first 15 games of the season, Indiana had 
difficulty producing consistent pitching 
or hitting. Strikeouts also plagued the 
offense. Junior outfielder Matt Gorski 
was the only hitter making significant 
contributions.

Players to watch: Junior Outfielder 

Matt Gorski and Senior Right-hander 
Pauly Milto

Gorski, a Big Ten preseason honored 

player, has been moved into the leadoff 
spot thanks to his team-leading .329 
batting average. Pauly Milto, meanwhile, 
has established himself as the team’s 
leading pitcher, and the team enters 
its first conference series against Iowa 
coming of a five-game win streak. Don’t 
count them out just yet.

Nebraska (7-7)
After 
the 
Cornhuskers 
earned 

their first Big Ten title in 2017, their 
2018 season with a 24-28 record was a 
disappointment stemming from injury 
problems within the pitching staff as well 
as offensive inconsistency. Having lost its 
two leading hitters, Chad Luensmann 
and Connor Curry, Nebraska will have 
to find a way to fill gaps in its offense. 
The Cornhuskers’ mixed record thus far 
indicates this will be a challenge.

Player to watch: Freshman Infielder/

Right-hander Spencer Schwellenbach

Nebraska 
is 
fortunate 
to 
have 

Schwellenbach — who turned down 
an opportunity to join the Cleveland 
Indians after being drafted in the 34th 
round. He has the team’s second highest 
batting average so far this year at .333.

AIDAN WOUTAS
Daily Sports Writer

At the start of the season, 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich had a 
feeling.

“I do like this group,” Bakich 

said. “I think this group has a lot 
of potential. On paper, at least, the 
pieces are there to have a special, 
magical type of season.”

Now, the No. 23 Michigan 

baseball team is validating that 
feeling. It has quality pitching 
and elite defense. A cohesive team 
chemistry and the drive to prove 
itself. It’s only missing one thing — 
a consistent offense.

Starting off the year in Florida, 

the bats looked red-hot, averaging 
nine runs per game over the three-
game series, leaving Binghamton 
in the dust. The next week, The 
Wolverines’ bats showed the first 
signs of slowing down — averaging 
just over five runs per game as they 
rode their impressive pitching to 
comfortable victories.

In California, the problems 

were aired out for the whole 
country to see. Junior infielder 
Jordan 
Brewer 
and 
junior 

outfielder Jordan Nwogu were tied 
with Michigan’s highest batting 
average at just .285. The team eked 
out an average of just over three 
runs per game against the team’s 
toughest competition all year — 
USC, Oklahoma State and then No. 
2 UCLA.

Beyond hitting, the Wolverines’ 

other offensive weaknesses were 
exposed. 
In 
the 
Dodgertown 

Classic, five times Michigan’s 
baserunners were caught stealing 
or put out. The team’s aggressive 
mindset was being pushed too 
far, it had crossed the fine line of 
positive mistakes it was treading 
earlier in the season — aggressive 
defensive 
plays 
and 
forcing 

opposition to make tough choices 
— to bad mistakes.

“We had a lot of outs on the 

bases from this trip,” Bakich said. 
“Whether it be caught stealing or 
pick-offs, those are very costly 
mistakes 
against 
really 
good 

teams. We can get away with it 
against lesser teams, you can’t get 
away with it against UCLA, USC, 
Oklahoma State, some of these 
west coast teams that are playing 
outside all year long”

The Wolverines’ 3-4 run over 

Spring Break sent them tumbling 
down most rankings. The only poll 
that kept them in the top 25 was 
Baseball America, dropping them 
to No. 23.

“All of the games were close 

because of our pitching and our 
defense in the losses,” Bakich said. 
“That’s how we’re built, and we 
are not even close to firing on all 
cylinders offensively.”

Bakich predicted an offensive 

storm following the trip, but not 
even the most optimistic fan could 
have predicted the onslaught to 
come on Michigan’s five-game 
homestand. With 50 runs, the 
Wolverines blew past their two 
opponents 
— 
Manhattan 
and 

Western Michigan.

But Michigan’s ability to score 

against struggling teams isn’t 
a question. The question is if it 
can keep a productive offense 
throughout the season against 
good teams — the same question 
that was asked last year.

After an awful start to 2018, the 

Wolverines went on a 20-game win 
streak that ended shortly before 
the postseason. Their offense 
couldn’t show up — only averaging 
two runs over the last six games — 
and they crashed out of the Big Ten 
Tournament after two games.

Bakich, though, has a feeling 

this year is different.

“It feels like a championship 

team,” Bakich said.

First, they’ll need to prove it.

KENT SCHWARTZ

Big Ten Breakdown

A question of offensive
consistency

The 2018 season for Michigan 

baseball was a roller-coaster.

After losing 11 players to the 

MLB draft, many freshmen and 
inexperienced players were thrown 
into important roles. After a 4-11 start 
last season, the Wolverines followed 
by going on a 20-game win-streak. 
After accomplishing such a great 
achievement, Michigan subsequently 
crashed — a disappointing Big Ten 
Tournament and a poor finish for 
the regular season resulted in the 
Wolverines getting left out of the 
College World Series.

This season couldn’t be more 

different.

Michigan coach Erik Bakich and 

this team entered the season with high 
expectations — and so far they seem to 
be on track. The experience gained by 
those young and untested players has 
already paid dividends as they have led 
the Wolverines to a 14-4 record.

Michigan 
has 
used 
only 
two 

newcomers extensively in its lineup thus 
far. Junior outfielder Jordan Brewer 
who transferred in 2018 after two 
seasons at Lincoln Trail Community 
College (Illinois) and freshman right-
hander Willie Weiss. Brewer has been 
a consistent starter all season while 

Weiss has seen opportunities in a relief 
role.

The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
and 

pitching were expected to be their 
strengths this season and have been 
as advertised with a team ERA of just 
2.56 and a team fielding percentage 
of .974. But their hitting has also been 
impressive. Michigan has put up five 
or more runs in 11 of its first 18 games. 
As a team, the Wolverines average over 
seven runs per game and have a healthy 
batting average at .281.

The Daily breaks down the team 

position-by-position:

Pitchers
Someone with two first names is 

usually subject to a plethora of jokes.

But junior Tommy Henry’s season 

has been no joke.

The left-handed ace has been dealing 

this season. His 0.51 ERA and a 5-0 
record puts him atop the team and the 
Big Ten in both categories. He leads the 
team in innings pitched, has the fewest 
walks, earned runs and batting average.

Henry has a strong supporting cast 

of starters in junior right-hander Karl 
Kauffman and sophomore right-hander 
Jeff Criswell. Kauffman would be the 
headliner if not for the outstanding 
performance of Henry. Kauffman 
has an ERA of 1.06 and a 4-1 record. 
He holds his opponents to a batting 
average of .164. Criswell rounds out the 
rotation with a 3.51 ERA. Criswell has 

seen a major step up in his role after 
pitching in relief last season. The loss 
of sophomore left-hander Ben Dragani 
to season ending Tommy John surgery 
seems to have pushed Criswell into a 
larger role.

Catchers
Sophomore Joe Donovan grabbed 

the starting position in the offseason 
and hasn’t looked back. Donovan has 
been a steady presence behind the 
plate thus far. His defensive prowess 
with a .993 fielding percentage and his 
vocal leadership have made Donovan 
a key player for Michigan. Freshman 
Casey Buckley and redshirt sophomore 
Harrison Salter are the primary 
reserves for Donovan. Combined, 
they’ve played in 12 games and started 
four. Unlike last season, catcher is a 
known quantity and should continue to 
be a strength for the Wolverines.

First Base
Junior Jordan Brewer was a bit of 

an unknown coming into the season. 
Bakich raved about his athleticism, but 
Brewer’s batting has been the highlight 
of this season. Against Manhattan, 
Brewer had the bases loaded with two 
outs and an 0-2 count. He crushed 
the ball into left field for a grand slam 
adding to his collection of highlights 
this season. He has started all 18 games 
and has the third best batting average 
on the team at .368. But, Brewer is 
more than just a slugger. His fielding 

percentage is an incredible .986. At first 
base, Michigan is solid both defensively 
and offensively so don’t expect many 
opportunities for the reserve players.

Second Base
Last season, senior Ako Thomas 

suffered a wrist injury derailing a 
promising 
junior 
campaign. 
This 

season, he is looking to reach the All-
Big Ten First Team form he enjoyed in 
his sophomore season. Thomas looks 
healthy again and, while his early 
season batting average is lower than 
last season, he has plenty of time to 
rectify those issues. Thomas’ defense 
has been top-notch again this season 
with a fielding percentage of .982. 
Additionally, his base-running skills 
are something that the Wolverines will 
look to utilize. Over his sophomore and 
junior seasons Thomas stole 38 bases 
— an impressive tally considering his 
junior season was shortened due to the 
aforementioned injury. Thomas has 
split time this season with senior Blake 
Nelson. Nelson brings an added element 
of batting with an impressive .452 
average in 11 games this season. But, 
the added power comes with a tradeoff 
as Nelson has accrued six errors this 
season compared to Thomas’ one.

Shortstop
Sophomore Jack Blomgren has 

retained his starting position from 
last season. Blomgren appears to have 
made a significant jump since then, 

batting at .339 as compared to .216 last 
season. Blomgren already has 13 RBI 
this season compared to last season’s 
tally of 18 in less than half of the games. 
Blomgren’s fielding has improved vastly 
as well, with just one error this season.

Third Base
Senior Jimmy Kerr is the veteran 

leader of this team. Kerr returns as 
starter this season and, while his 
batting has not been exceptional, his 
defense appears to have improved since 
last season. Kerr has built on his fielding 
percentage from last season, going from 
.893 to .923. Kerr is a steady presence 
on both the field and in the dugout. 
His teammates have a lot of respect 
for the player who embodies Michigan 
baseball. Kerr’s father and grandfather 
played at Michigan as well. Kerr has 
started every game this season.

Outfield
After starting the past two seasons 

in left field, redshirt senior Miles Lewis 
has been shifted over to right field. 
Lewis has been a solid hitter this season 
at .292 — a marked improvement over 
.230 last season. His two home runs 
this season nearly equal last season’s 
total of three. Lewis has once again 
been a pillar of Michigan’s defense with 
a 1.000 fielding percentage.

Jimmy Kerr and three generations of Michigan baseball

Every player on the Michigan 

baseball team has a mantra. 
Something 
they 
repeat 
to 

themselves before every game, 
every 
at-bat, 
every 
pitch. 

Something to get them in the 
right mindset .

For most players, it’s action-

based. Attack. Right now. Pound 
it.

Not Jimmy Kerr.
His mantra is three letters: 

J. D. J. 

J for John, his grandfather, 

who 
played 
baseball 
for 

Michigan in the 60s. D for 
Derek, his father, who did the 
same 20 years later. And J for 
Jimmy.

He wears their initials on his 

glove, and he has them on his 
bat. Every game. Every at-bat. 
Every pitch.

J. D. J.
“We talk all the time about 

how we’re standing on the 
shoulders of great men. It’s 
something we really value a 
lot as a program,” Jimmy said. 
“This is just my own little piece 
of that, to have my dad and my 
grandpa with me at all times.”

The Kerrs are a Michigan 

family.

There’s 
Jimmy, 
who’s 

now a senior in the school of 
engineering. Derek met his 
wife, Carolyn — Jimmy’s mom 
— when they were graduate 
students at the Ross School of 
Business in the early nineties. 
John also met his wife, Sharon, 
here when they were students. 

In 1962, John won a College 

World Series as a starting 
pitcher with Team 96.

In 1983 and 1984, Derek went 

to the College World Series 
twice as a catcher with Teams 
117 and 118. 

Now, in 2019, Jimmy starts at 

third base as a captain for Team 
153. 

Though the Kerrs’ Michigan 

tradition doesn’t start with 
John — his parents also met 
here — he was the first in the 
family to compete for Michigan 
baseball. As a starting pitcher 
with 
the 
Wolverines 
from 

1960-62, John was a key part 
of a commanding Michigan 
pitching staff that helped the 
Wolverines dominate the Big 
Ten. More than fifty years 
later, he still remembers how 
his “nasty” changeup screwball 
stifled batter after batter.

“Sophomore Kerr registered 

his fifth straight win without a 
defeat and stymied the Spartan 
batsmen by never allowing a 
runner to reach second base,” 
the Daily reported in 1962. 

“The capable starter kept the 
ball low and around the plate 
most of the afternoon, causing 
the majority of men he faced to 
hit bounders to the infield.”

Michigan 
wouldn’t 
have 

gotten to the College World 
Series without John. In the 
regional final, he pitched both 
ends of a doubleheader against 
Illinois and Western Michigan. 
He threw 313 pitches and 
won both games to send the 
Wolverines to Omaha, where 
they defeated Santa Clara 5-4 
in 15 innings.

“(Playing for Michigan) was 

a great experience — one of 
the best of my life,” John said. 
“It brings back such wonderful 
memories.”

Derek was the next of the 

Kerrs 
to 
don 
a 
Michigan 

uniform. After hearing stories 
from his dad’s years playing 
with the Wolverines, Derek 
knew it was a program — and 
a tradition — he wanted to be a 
part of.

“I grew up bleeding blue,” he 

said. “It was always a goal of 
mine to come here and play at 
the U of M.”

He walked onto the team as 

a catcher in 1982 and earned 
a varsity letter in three of his 
four years with the team. The 
Wolverines went to the College 
World Series his freshman and 
sophomore years and came 
close his junior and senior 
years.

Though Derek did not play 

much, his four years playing 
baseball at Michigan were still 
full of meaning for him. He 
played on teams with sports 
agent Casey Close and future 
Hall of Famer Barry Larkin, 
who won the World Series in 
1990 with the Reds. 

Despite his minimal playing 

time, coming to Michigan and 
continuing his family’s legacy 
both on and off the field was a 
meaningful experience.

“It’s the best academic and 

athletic 
institution 
in 
the 

country,” Derek said. “I never 
thought of going anywhere else 
for college.”

Growing up in a house with 

such strong family ties to the 
Michigan tradition, there was 
never any question for Jimmy 
about where he wanted to go 
to college. After spending his 
fall Saturdays watching the 
Wolverines with his father, 
Jimmy had no doubt that he one 
day wanted to put on the block 
M for himself.

“It was always my dream, 

as a baseball player, to come 
here and play for Michigan,” 
he said. “Especially having my 
family around — my parents 
make it to most games, and my 

grandparents have lived thirty 
minutes away for the last four 
years, so they’re always here 
— just being able to represent 
them while they’re in the stands 
means everything to me.”

But as meaningful as it is for 

the Kerrs to have Jimmy play 
for Michigan, it was important 
to everyone that the program 
was the right choice for more 
reasons than just tradition. The 
family baseball lineage alone 
could not be the sole reason 
behind Jimmy’s choice. 

Any 
such 
concerns 
were 

alleviated the minute Jimmy 
stepped on campus for his 
recruiting trip. The Kerrs were 
all impressed with the culture 
Michigan coach Bakich has 
created, building not only great 
athletes but great men.

“It’s special for us as a family 

for him to have the opportunity 
to play there. Coach Bakich 
gave him the opportunity to 
be a part of the team, and we 
appreciate that and everything 
else Coach Bakich has done 
for him so much,” Derek said. 
“It means so much to us — the 
person he’s become playing 
with such a special group of 
players and playing under such 
a special group of coaches. 

“It’s one thing to be good 

athletes, but it’s another thing 
to develop this group of 35 
kids into the people that they 
are and the people that they’re 
going to be when they’re done 
with athletics.”

Though his playing time 

was limited through his first 
three seasons at Michigan, 
Jimmy had plenty of bright 
spots. He hit .375 with a .531 
on-base percentage over 14 
games as a freshman and had 
a .412 slugging percentage and 
a .964 fielding percentage as 
a sophomore. As a junior, he 
knocked out his first home 
run of the season in a clutch 
moment to help seal a series 
win over Rutgers.

But as a senior, Jimmy has 

stepped into a larger role with 
the team, starting every game 
this season. Since settling into 
a role in the lower middle of 
Michigan’s batting order, he 
has 14 hits, three of which were 
home runs, and 13 RBI on the 
season so far. 

“He’s hitting the ball with a 

lot of juice in the bat,” Bakich 
said. “It’s really good to see.”

But for a program that prides 

itself so much on its history, 
Jimmy represents more than 
his offensive production and 
his defensive statistics. He 
embodies the tradition and 
the history that the Michigan 
baseball program is steeped in.

“To have a guy like that on 

our team, he’s just such a great 
inspiration and role model to 
all the other guys,” Bakich said. 
“It’s so easy how much it means 
to him. It’s so much more than 
most.”

When it faced Manhattan 

on Mar. 17, Michigan brought 
out its throwback uniforms. 
To honor the 1962 team, the 
Wolverines wore the jerseys 
that team wore when they 
won the College World Series, 
giving Jimmy a chance to 
wear the same jersey as his 
grandfather did.

“Coach pulled up the picture 

of the championship team in 
our meeting today. We hadn’t 
seen the jerseys before today. 
When he pulled one out of his 
bag, it looked almost exactly 
the same (as the ones the 1962 
team wore),” Jimmy said. “It 
was just so cool to be able to 
wear his jersey.” 

For many, the jerseys were 

simply a tribute to Michigan 
teams 
of 
years 
past. 
For 

Jimmy and John, they were a 
symbolic connector, bridging 
the generations of Kerrs to put 
on the maize and blue.

“It’s 
been 
a 
fabulous 

experience to see (Derek) play 
there and then to see Jimmy 
play there,” John said. “It’s 
hard to describe. It’s obviously 
one of the highlights of my life. 
I’m glad they had the same 
experience that I did because 
it was such a valuable, life-
changing experience.”
