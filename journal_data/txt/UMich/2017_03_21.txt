The University of Michigan 

Senate Assembly gathered on 
Monday to elect three new 
representatives to the Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University Affairs and further 
discuss its official statement 
regarding 
the 
University’s 

views 
on 
transgender 

bathroom policies.

The meeting began with a 

presentation of the resolution 
SACUA drafted earlier this 
month that states all members 
of the campus community 
should have the right to use 
the bathroom that matches 
their gender identity.

The Assembly was given 

the opportunity to discuss, 
amend and vote on whether 
they wanted to support the 
resolution. 

Assembly members brought 

up several changes they’d 
like to see made, such as a 
statement about visitors, and 
others wanted to broaden the 
language of the resolution.

Engineering 
Prof. 
Doug 

Noll spoke up, stating he 
was 
uncertain 
about 
the 

explicit promotion of safe 
spaces in the statement’s first 
sentence, which states: “The 
University faculty governance 
is committed to working to 
create a safe and inclusive 
space for all people. We 
support a policy that allows 
all members of our campus 

to use bathrooms consistent 
with their gender identity.”

“I’m 
a 
little 
concerned 

about the first sentence,” Noll 
said. “You might read that 
to say that we’re endorsing 
safe spaces generically, and 
I’m not sure I would be in 
favor of creating safe spaces 
where you can’t have robust 
discussions.”

Further 
discussion 
led 

to the Assembly to remove 

the entire first sentence of 
the resolution, leaving them 
with a statement solely about 
bathrooms.

The amended version of 

the resolution read: “The 
University faculty governance 
supports a policy that allows 
all members and visitors to 
our campus to use bathrooms 
consistent with their gender 
identity.”

It passed unanimously.

The Assembly then moved 

into elections of the next 
SACUA representatives. LSA 
Prof. Silke-Maria Weineck, 
LSA Prof. John Lehman and 
Pharmacy Prof. David Smith 
will all end their terms as 
SACUA representatives this 
April. Six faculty members 
were nominated from the 
Assembly to fill their seats, 
and three were elected.

Thirteen 
candidates 
and 
a 

presidential and vice presidential 
nominee presented their platforms 
and answered questions from 
constituents at the University 
of 
Michigan 
LSA 
Student 

Government Candidates’ Forum 
on Monday night in the Michigan 
League.

The 
candidates 
addressed 

topics ranging from increasing 
student involvement in campus 
organizations to improving the 
political 
dialogue 
on 
campus. 

The students gave speeches for 13 
open representative seats, and one 
presidential candidate and one vice 
presidential candidate spoke about 
their platforms to an audience of 
about 20 people. Voting will take 
place on Wednesday and Thursday.

A 
common 
theme 
among 

platforms 
was 
increased 

communication between students 
and administrators. LSA freshman 
Kevan Casson, a candidate for 
representative, 
addressed 
the 

importance of making internship 
and 
employment 
opportunities 

more visible to students.

Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 

unanimously passed a resolution 
Monday to oppose cuts to the 
Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, which were 
released last week in President 
Donald Trump’s administration 
budget outline, obtained by the 
Washington Post.

The new budget for 2018 

includes over $6 billion in cuts to 
HUD, stating that state and local 
jurisdictions are better suited to 
address their own needs. One of 
the major missions of HUD, now 
headed by Secretary Ben Carson, 
is to provide affordable housing 
for all residents of the United 
States.

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski (D–Ward 5) opposed 
the cuts, saying the harm they 
would do to the community 
would be greater than the value 
of the dollars saved.

“I have the privilege of serving 

on the Urban County Steering 
Committee for the City, and in 
that role I see a couple things,” 
he said. “One, I see how these 
funds that are under attack are

The University of Michigan 

Museum of Natural History 
announced plans last Friday 
to close its Ruthven Museums 
Building location. The building 
will officially close on Dec. 
31, 2017 and the museum will 
permanently move to the new 
Biological Sciences Building in 
2018.

It was announced over two 

years ago that the building 
would close once the new 
Biological Sciences Building was 
finished across the street.

According to a University 

press release, the museum will 
incorporate the biological theme 
of its new home into the exhibits 
with a display on cells, genes 
and molecules. Along with new 
exhibits, the famous mastodon 
couple 
and 
two 
prehistoric 

whales will be featured at the 
entrance of the BSB.

Amy Harris, the director 

of the Museum of Natural 
History, said the move will be 
a continuous process until the 
final opening event in the fall of 
2019.

“We’ll be opening in three 

stages,” she said. “We’ll be 
closing on New Year’s of this year 
and then, while we’re closed to 
the public, we’ll be moving all of 
our specimens and our exhibits 
and our people over to the new 
building and getting settled 
into our new work spaces. We 
have an exhibit firm that we’ve 
hired to help us develop, design, 
fabricate and install the new 
exhibits and they will be doing 
that installation in batches.”

Harris said she has high 

hopes for the museum after the 
move and said the act of moving 
buildings is not new to the 
Natural History Museum.

“(The 
Ruthven 
Building) 

is the third location of our 
museum since it was founded in 
1837 with the Cabinet of Natural 
History,” she said. “Moving to 
the Biological Sciences Building, 
that’ll be our fourth move, so

Movement, eMerge and DAAP discuss campaign platforms at Daily-hosted event

The Michigan Daily hosted 

its 
second 
annual 
University 

of 
Michigan 
Central 
Student 

Government debate on Monday 
night, with the president and 
vice president candidates from 
eMerge, Movement and the Defend 
Affirmative Action Party fielding 

questions from moderators and 
online submissions. The fourth 
party running, Better Than the 
Rest, did not attend the debate due 
to a scheduling conflict. 

The parties began the debate 

with overviews of their platforms, 
highlighting the initiatives they felt 
most strongly about.

DAAP’s presidential candidate 

and vice presidential candidate 
are Art & Design senior Keysha 
Wall and LSA senior Lauren Kay, 
respectively. Both Wall and Kay 
stressed that their main focus 
was empowering undocumented 

students, with an emphasis on 
ending the 28-month residency 
within high school cutoff of in-state 
tuition for these students. 

Presidential candidate Anushka 

Sarkar, LSA junior, and vice-
presidential 
candidate 
Nadine 

Jawad, Public Policy junior — 
who are running with eMerge — 
maintained that the three pillars 
of their campaign were voice, 
opportunity and momentum. They 
highlighted the importance of 
building upon the momentum the 
current CSG administration has 
built with its recent initiatives, and 

making CSG proceedings more 
transparent.

LSA juniors Evan Rosen and 

Dan Sweeney, who are running 
for president and vice-president 
the Movement party respectively, 
responded to the recent video 
controversy they were facing, before 
Rosen departed for a hearing.

Issues of sexual misconduct, 

CSG 
experience 
and 
diversity 

were frequently brought up during 
the debate, with all six candidates 
proposing various initiatives to 
address these.

President Donald Trump’s 

presidency is considered 

illegitimate by 57 percent of 

young adults, according to a poll 

conducted by GenForward. 

Among those who were 

surveyed, a slight majority 

of white voters age 18 to 30 

found Trump’s presidency to 

be legitimate. However, within 

that group, 55 percent said they 

disapprove of his efforts as 

president.

The poll, administered 

by a research group from the 

University of Chicago, also found 

that within the group of 18 to 30 

year olds polled, only 22 percent 

approve of the job Trump is doing 

as president, while 62 percent 

disapproved.

These numbers have been 

reflected on the University 

of Michigan’s predominantly 

Democratic-leaning campus. 

During the election season, 

surveys by The Michigan Daily 

showed approximately 70 percent 

of students supported Clinton 

over Trump or other third-

party candidates. Additionally, 

following the election, there have 

been multiple protests pushing 

back against Trump’s presidency.

At a vigil immediately 

following the election, University 

President Mark Schlissel 

encouraged students to stand up 

against hatred.

“Ninety percent of you 

rejected the kind of hate and the 

fractiousness and the longing for 

some kind of idealized version of 

a non-existent yesterday that was 

expressed during the campaign,” 

Schlissel said in November. “So I 

urge you, continue your advocacy 

and your voices are already being 

heard. They are loud and clear — 

this is the way America changes. 

It’s the way it always changes. 

It’s the way it will change for the 

better.”

A recent press release from the 

University of Michigan’s Central 
Student Government introduced 
the 
Student 
Fee 
Advisory 

Committee, which was originally 
announced on March 8 and is 
co-chaired by the presidents 
of CSG and Rackham Student 
Government. 
In 
coordination 

with E. Royster Harper, the 
University’s vice president for 
student life, this committee of 
nine students will meet twice 
during both the fall and winter 
terms next year.

As stated in the press release, 

the committee will work to 
increase 
the 
participation 

of students in activities and 
organizations on campus before 
developing 
student 
fees 
and 

making recommendations to the 

University’s Board of Regents, 
and will also give feedback on the 
needs of students, specifically in 
relation to these fees.

By providing students with 

more opportunities to voice their 
opinions and concerns, the SFAC 
looks to continue encouraging 
the input of students. In the 
press release, CSG President 
David Schafer, LSA senior, spoke 
specifically of this importance.

“The elevation of student voice 

in as many avenues of University 
decision-making as possible has 
been one of our major goals this 
year,” he said. 

The 
recommendations 
the 

committee makes will come 
directly 
from 
the 
consensus 

of its members. If a consensus 
cannot be reached, a majority 
recommendation will instead be 
used for student fee approval and 
allocation.

In an email interview, CSG 

Communications Director Joseph 
Shea, a Public Policy senior, said 
SFAC will provide students with 
a way to connect more directly 
with upper-level administration 
and to have a say in the impact of 
fees affecting both their tuition 

and their participation in campus 
organizations.

“The 
student 
fee 
is 
a 

powerful tool: it permits the 

allocation 
of 
financial 

resources towards pressing 
on-campus 
concerns,” 
he 

wrote. “When I was a first 
year student, the Proppe 
administration 
increased 

the student fee in order to 
provide additional funding 
for student organizations. As 
this 
administration 
winds 

down, we felt it was important 
to have an institutionalized 
body that is both independent 
of CSG and will represent 
students in discussions on any 
student-fee related issues with 
the Vice President of Student 
Life.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Chang 

Yang wrote in an email she 
was not aware she pays for 
services such as CSG. 

“I definitely would like 

to hear more about this new 
CSG committee because any 
increased 
communication 

between our student body 
and the Regents in terms of 
how effectively the students’ 
money is spent is good,” she 
wrote.

Diversity
The candidates all stressed 

the importance of on-campus 
diversity to their platforms, and 
talked about the different ways 
they planned on approaching the 
issue.

Sarkar and Jawad mentioned 

they have a wide range of 
perspectives 
in 
their 
party, 

and their initiatives are based 
on real experiences members 
of their party have had. While 
both of them believe they can 
not represent people of other 
identities, they emphasized the 
importance 
of 
transcending 

boundaries.

“eMerge 
believes 
diversity 

is of utmost importance when 
attempting to represent a wide 
range of ideas, backgrounds and 
identities on campus,” Sarkar said. 

“We are the only party running 
that has students from the most 
schools represented, as well as 
diversity of identities, diversity 
of experiences on campus and 
diversities 
of 
socioeconomic 

status.”

Jawad also touched upon her 

own experiences as a woman 
of color and the rarity of seeing 
her representation in student 
government. 

Sweeney said he doesn’t know 

what it feels like to be a minority 
student, but he advocates giving 
students the tools to deal with 
lack of diversity. Movement is 
also in favor of making the Race 
and Ethnicity requirement a first-
year requirement to encourage 
freshmen 
to 
have 
important 

discussions about diversity as 
soon as they step onto campus. 
Sweeney also said he believed 
every 
student 
belonged 
on 

campus, 
regardless 
of 
their 

political views, and that simply 
being on campus and exposed to 

ideas can help students learn and 
grow.

“Yes, we should look for the 

best candidates at this school, 
period,” Sweeney said. “But I 
believe there will be an overall 
increase in diversity of minds and 
perspectives joining CSG if we 
are elected, because that’s what 
we’re trying to do, we’re trying to 
get people on this campus excited 
about CSG.”

Wall 
and 
Kay 
described 

themselves as having diverse 
identities and backgrounds, and 
highlighted the integration of 
their own party. They expressed 
frustration with the fact that 
administrators don’t push for 
data collection of other identities, 
such as queer populations. They 
also want to push administrators 
to adopt the Texas House Bill 
588, better known as the Top 10 
Percent plan, guarantees students 
in the top 10 percent of their 
high school class admissions to 
state universities. This however, 

would conflict with the state 
of Michigan’s ban on race- and 
gender-based affirmative action 
prohibiting 
discrimination 
on 

the basis of sex, gender and 
socioeconomic status.

“(We need) to further integrate 

this campus, and if you’re going 
to have a (Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion) plan, have a DEI 
plan that is actively working 
to 
integrate 
this 
campus,” 

Wall said. “That means going 
to Detroit schools and doing 
on-site admissions. Aggressively, 
aggressively courting students 
from low-income areas, from 
majority Black cities … These are 
the steps that can easily, easily be 
taken. This is something that’s not 
on the student body to fix, but is 
on us to set the example and the 
tone for the administration, for 
the people who would be able to 
do something about this.”

this is not unprecedented.”

Museum employee Mishaal 

Khan, a University alum who 
graduated in 2016, said the 
schematics for the new space 
show a renovated and larger 
area compared to the Ruthven 
Building.

“I am super, super excited 

about the new changes,” Khan 
said. “When you look at the 
(museum) 
sketches, 
there’s 

going to be a lot more space and 
a lot more new exhibits … (The 
Ruthven Building) is like 90 years 
old and there’s no AC.”

In December, the Regents 

approved 
a 
$150 
million 

renovation 
project 
for 
the 

Ruthven Building, which will 

add 100,000 square feet for 
classrooms 
and 
auditoriums 

and will renovate spaces for dry 
labs and the University’s central 
administrative offices, currently 
housed in the Fleming Building. 
The 
Fleming 
Building 
will 

eventually be demolished.

LSA senior Kathryn Zoller 

previously worked on a project 
under German professor Kastin 
Baindt researching the history 
and the impact of museums 
at the University. She said the 
renovations 
to 
the 
Ruthven 

Building preserve the building’s 
legacy and are a much better 
option than destroying it.

“I’m very happy to hear that 

they’re not going to tear down 
the Ruthven Building, which was 
a big concern for me with the 
move,” she said. “I really like the 
historic Ruthven Building.”

Khan is one of the employees 

working 
on 
the 
museum’s 

newest 
initiative, 
Museum 

Memories, which catalogs public 
submissions of photos and stories 
about experiences at the Ruthven 
Building. She said the archive 
celebrates the museum’s history 
and the University’s bicentennial.

“So far, what’s been archived 

and uploading to the site are some 
really cool memories,” she said. 
“People have come to the museum 
for 90 years … People have really 
sweet memories of their kids 
there, too.”

Zoller 
said

Four of the nominees from 

the Ann Arbor campus were 
LSA Profs. Andreas Gailus and 
Neil Marsh and Medical School 
Profs. Kathryn Eaton and Sami 
Malek. 
Business 
Prof. 
Joy 

Beatty was nominated from the 
Dearborn campus and History 
Prof. John Ellis was nominated 
from the Flint campus. 

Each candidate was given 

time to speak to the Assembly 
about why they wanted to serve 
on SACUA.

Some candidates felt their 

field expertise would be helpful 
in this new position. Beatty 
submitted a video with her 
statement, as she is on sabbatical 
in New Zealand. She stressed 
to Assembly members that she 
felt her organizational studies 
background would help make 
SACUA communicate better and 
run in a smoother fashion.

“What I like to think I can 

contribute, if I were elected, 
is that I have organizational 
expertise, 
which 
helps 
me 

be in tune to organizational 
processes,” Beatty said. “I think 
faculty governance is a tradition 
we should cherish.”

Communication 
was 

a 
popular 
theme 
among 

candidates. Ellis said his main 
goal if elected would be to 
increase 
communication 
and 

cooperation among all three of 
the University’s campuses.

“We should continue to press 

for more integration of Flint 
and Dearborn into a single 
University system and promote 
communication,” Ellis said. “A 
lot of times, things that happen 
in SACUA tend to just appear 
in Flint … I think in the end, we 
will be stronger as one faculty, 
in reality, than we would be as 
three different campuses doing 
the same thing.”

Malek 
and 
Gaius 
both 

shared the view that faculty 
governance has a duty to protect 
the institution of the University. 
If elected, Malek promised to 
hold on to traditional academic 

values.

“I 
have 
fundamentally 

stood for traditional academic 
behavior … and commerce and 
less 
bottom-line 
decisions,” 

Malek 
said. 
“I 
think 

relationship-building 
and 

honesty are how you get people 
to listen to you, and that’s what 
I’m going to try to do for all of 
you.”

Marsh 
rounded 
out 
the 

speeches. He said he wanted to 
work on expanding the current 
work of SACUA, as well as 
making faculty governance more 
reachable to and communicative 
with the greater University 
community.

“If I am elected, I would like to 

be a builder,” he said. “I’d like to 
build on the important work that 
SACUA is doing. I’d like to build 
support, enthusiasm and better 
channels 
of 
communication 

to 
the 
broader 
faculty. 
I 

want to build bridges (to) the 
administration 
and 
bridges 

outside the administration. We 
don’t need to be building walls, 
and we certainly don’t need to 
be living in our ivory tower.”

Once all the speeches were 

heard, 
Assembly 
members 

voted for the three candidates 
they wanted to serve as SACUA 
representatives. The votes were 
tallied, and though it was a close 
election, it was announced that 
Beatty, Malek and Marsh had 
been chosen to serve. Their 
terms will begin this May.

The 
meeting, 
which 
was 

the 
second-to-last 
Assembly 

meeting of the academic year, 
ended with SACUA President 
Bill 
Schultz, 
professor 
of 

mechanical 
engineering, 

welcoming the new members 
into the committee. He will give 
an official end-of-year statement 
at next month’s meeting, but he 
said a quick thanks to the body 
for a good year and mentioned 
the elections for a new president 
will be held soon. 

“It’s been a pleasure to serve 

you, but it’s time to pass the 
torch to someone else,” Schultz 
said. “We hope to have that 
election in the not-so-distant 
future. That’s chosen by the 
present members of SACUA.”

used to leverage. A dollar that 
goes in yields a lot more than 
a dollar in terms of community 
good. But I also every now and 
then get to hear some of the 
personal stories of how these 
funds make a difference in 
people’s lives. We talk about 
the numbers, but there are 
lives behind these numbers. 
These funds provide a lifeline 
to 
these 
people, 
and 
to 

threaten them is to threaten 
some of the best members of 
our community.”

Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman 
(D–Ward 
3) 

emphasized the real effects 
the cuts would have on Ann 
Arbor residents, specifically 
mentioning 
HUD-Veterans 

Affairs Supportive Housing 
vouchers, 
which 
provide 

monetary 
assistance 
to 

veterans in need of housing.

“As we dig deeper and ask 

‘how does this affect our local 

community in terms of the 
most vulnerable,’ we’re also 
looking at two to three million 
dollars in cuts to the Ann 
Arbor Housing Commission,” 
Ackerman said. “And these 
are programs that go to 
house veterans, the disabled, 
to house people of limited 
income simply because this 
society doesn’t provide enough 
to them. We spent the last six 
years in Washtenaw County 
fighting veteran homelessness, 
and in the past year got it to a 
functional zero. And cuts to 
the VASH voucher program 
put that entirely at risk. These 
cuts will put people on the 
street.”

Councilmember Jack Eaton 

(D–Ward 4) voted in favor 
of the resolution but said he 
thought the HUD cuts were 
just one of many problems 
with the new budget and the 
resolution on its own was not 
enough.

communication between students 
in government and the LSA 
Opportunity ... Hub to better 
prepare students for their career,” 
Casson said. 

LSA 
freshman 
candidate 

Mohsin Arsiwala also emphasized 
the importance of assisting LSA 
students in their searches for 
internships and careers. Arsiwala 
proposed improving relations with 
the Alumni Center, to increase 
available 
connections 
between 

students and University alumni.

Another recurring topic during 

the speeches was how to increase 
the dialogue on campus about 
current events, especially given 
the current political climate on 
campus.

LSA 
sophomore 
Amanda 

Delekta, 
a 
representative 

candidate, proposed hosting an 
event that would discuss how 
to translate a passion for social 
justice into social change. A panel 
would be composed of different 
policy experts to answer students’ 

questions 
about 
implementing 

social change.

“I want to hold an event looking 

into how to change an idea for 
social change into tangible events,” 
Delekta said.

LSA sophomore Eli Rachlin 

talked 
about 
the 
importance 

of 
facilitating 
conversations 

between students with different 
political 
beliefs 
on 
campus. 

Citing the responses to the 2016 
presidential 
election, 
including 

the post-election protests, Rachlin 
believes it is crucial for students 
to be exposed to different ideas. 
He proposed bringing experts 
to campus to demonstrate the 
importance 
of 
understanding 

different viewpoints. 

“People 
don’t 
have 
the 

opportunity, nor do they want to go 
out of the way to find things outside 
of their bubble,” Rachlin said. “It 
would be cool to have people who 
have experience with expressing 
their opinions that may not be in 
line with what they have to say.”

M

arch 
Madness 
is 

about much more 
than 
68 
teams 

playing basketball to vie for a 
stupid trophy and 
bragging rights. It’s 
one of the largest 
spectacles in which 
the power of sports 
reveals more than 
just athletic ability. 

Over the years, 

we’ve seen stories 
of 
underdogs 

overcoming 
obstacles, 
coaches and players 
displaying the power 
of mentorship and, weirdly, 
how crazy the hoopla around 
college sports has become. We 
live in a country where the 
passion for college athletics is 
intense, but sometimes goes 
too far.

I was reading online the 

other day about a player from 
Vanderbilt who didn’t play 
as well as he usually does. 
The author posited that he — 
singlehandedly — potentially 
caused his team to lose its play-
in game. It’s odd to me that we 
live in a society where college 
students, many of them my 
age, are criticized and bear the 
burden of ridicule if they don’t 
perform well.

I’m part of it too; I’ve written 

articles about the performance 
of athletes and how that relates 
to team success, and there’s 
room for that. For now, I’m 
playing devil’s advocate by 
thinking about how it would 
feel to read critiques of your 
ability every day. But I want to 
remember from now on, before 
I get angry over a player’s shot 
selection, that they’re just like 
me — a 20-something year old 
just living life.

Me critiquing an athlete’s 

layup, for example, is like 
someone 
critiquing 
my 

penmanship when I take notes. 

It’s uncalled for, and 
frankly, I don’t know 
what 
I’m 
talking 

about, because the 
athlete 
has 
spent 

thousands of hours in 
the gym, not me.

I’ll 
probably 

gripe to my friends 
about 
something 

going 
against 
my 

wishes 
during 
the 

tournament, but I’ll try 
to hold my tongue and 

remind myself that the people 
on the court are students and 
amateurs. Though they may 
receive full rides, they don’t 
get paid. Most of them won’t 
play professionally. But they 
have spent countless hours 
with everyone in their ears — 
parents, coaches, teammates, 
die-hard fans.

For those reading this as 

college students, you know 
how hard it is to juggle school 
and extracurricular activities. 
Imagine having to travel every 
week, rising early every morning 
and still having to turn all your 
work in on time. Let’s give these 
guys a break sometimes.

For those who are older and 

critical, remember that these 
are college students trying their 
best. Mistakes happen. Humans 
are fallible. And there are more 
things to worry about than the 
result of a game.

I bet the athletes who will play 

face a lot of anxiety about playing 
up to expectations while being 
under the spotlight. It takes a lot 
of guts to be able to rise above the 
pressure. And criticism follows 
athletes for years. Fab Five 
member Chris Webber still gets 

patronized for calling a timeout 
in the NCAA Tournament when 
he had none, causing Michigan 
to lose the game.

I get that people can have huge 

attachments to their teams. I’ve 
been engrossed with sports culture 
my entire life, so I understand the 
passion. But verbally attacking 
an amateur, even when they 
can’t hear you, isn’t acceptable. 
It’s essentially continuing to 
perpetuate the ridicule of young 
adults. It’s even more profound to 
see how much more hate is out in 
the open because of social media.

Instead of breaking players 

down, it would be great to see 
them be built up. The most 
beautiful moments in sports are 
when the hate tweets and death 
threats are overshadowed by 
support and thankfulness when 
someone messes up.

Sometimes the relationship 

to athletes is blurred, as some 
see them as characters in games 
instead of human beings. They 
have emotions and probably don’t 
like to see negative reactions in 
the news and their social media 
notifications, just like everyone 
else. It would be better for 
everyone if people left them alone 
or viewed them as someone 
they know and love and want 
to succeed.

There are many debates about 

how to combat the ridicule and 
how to compensate for the pressure 
and amount of time that college 
athletes spend practicing. I believe, 
at least, that college athletes should 
be more humanized. The coverage 
shouldn’t be totally revamped, but 
an attitude of empathy is a good 
start to possibly taking some of 
the pressure off them.

D

uring my past four 
years on campus, as a 
former editor for this 

publication and as a student 
interested in campus policy, 
I’ve paid a lot of attention to 
Central Student Government 
elections. Each year, I can tell 
when campus has hit the peak 
of the election season — when 
I start seeing something from 
one of the parties on social 
media repeatedly.

This year, it looks like you, 

Movement, 
might 
get 
that 

honor. Over the past few days, 
I’ve been seeing your rap video 
frequently — but it’s been in an 
unusual way. Usually, people 
share CSG things because they 
think they’re funny, or because 
they’re 
interested 
in 
the 

party’s ideas. This time, I’ve 
been seeing it from people who 
think your video is offensive, 
myself included. In four years 
of these videos, I’ve yet to see 
one as tone-deaf or concerning.

I’m not going to spell out 

all the reasons why, because 
frankly, there are too many 
of 
them, 
ranging 
from 

having women only appear 
for 
five 
seconds 
to 
gaze 

adoringly at your candidate 
to your presidential candidate 
calling 
himself 
the 
“white 

George 
Washington 
Carver.” 

Delegitimizing 
people’s 
lived 

campus experiences or calling 
yourself the white version of 
anybody shouldn’t be a part of a 
campaign, nor should personally 
attacking candidates for their 
educational paths. It’s a display 
of privilege, plain and simple.

Nonetheless, if it was just 

the video, I might not have 
felt compelled to write this. 
And I want to acknowledge 
that after much defense of the 
video — including a statement 
from your presidential candidate 
that anybody who was offended 
shouldn’t be because it was “fun,” 
not serious — you did apologize 
during The Michigan Daily’s 
CSG debate. However, the point 
is that it’s not the just the video 
— there’s a similar ethos in your 
platform and your slate, which 
is notably less diverse than 
the other parties, that I hope 
you also choose to revisit and 
think more about in light of the 
feedback you’ve received.

Your “Mental Health Wake 

Up,” a proposal for a yearly 
lecture on mental health, is 
a key example. Combatting 

mental 
health 
issues 
on 

campus is fantastic and well-
needed. But saying the way to 
deal with it is by broadcasting 
that “we all have hardships and 
struggles throughout our time 
here,” as quoted from your 
website, is trivializing. It’s true 
that many, if not all, University 
of 
Michigan 
students 
will 

struggle during their time here, 
and it’s important to recognize 
that. But mental health issues 
aren’t just a “hardship.” They’re 
medical facts with debilitating 
impacts 
on 
people’s 
lives. 

Using your language is akin to 
equating sadness to depression 
or stress to anxiety disorders. 

And while a lecture is lovely, it 
won’t address the systemic lack 
of mental health resources on 
campus that students and the 
University have consistently 
identified as the most pressing 
issue in this arena.

Your “Send the Elevator” 

initiative 
also 
lacks 

awareness. Encouraging the 
University to do outreach in 
low-socioeconomic 
status 

communities 
is 
great 
(and 

in fact, it’s already doing it, 
though more can definitely 
be done). What’s troubling 
is 
your 
insistence 
that 
it 

should 
be 
“students 
from 

similar 
backgrounds” 
doing 

the 
outreach. 
Having 
low-

SES students connect with 
people who have faced similar 
challenges is reasonable and 
likely helpful. Where it becomes 

concerning is when you make it 
primarily their responsibility 
to 
mentor 
and 
encourage 

more 
low-SES 
students 
to 

come here. Everyone on this 
campus is accountable for this 
kind of work (and I’ll be the 
first to admit that I haven’t 
done nearly as much as I 
could), and to place it on the 
shoulders of low-SES students, 
who often are balancing more 
commitments with their time 
regardless, is problematic.

I 
don’t 
have 
the 
space 

to address the rest of your 
platform, but I want to note 
this — none of your specific 
10 initiatives touch on ways 
to improve diversity, though 
your pillars do. Many of your 
initiatives instead touch on 
things that are only one-
time 
events, 
are 
highly 

logistically challenging (such 
as redesigning the School of 
Education’s curriculum) or call 
for things already in place (to 
me, a “Committee of Student 
Action and Unity” sounds like 
what a student government is 
already supposed to do).

I want to give credit where 

it’s due — I like your proposals 
to improve lighting on Central 
Campus and increase SafeRide 
hours. I haven’t seen prior 
candidates pitch something like 
your “4 Years” initiative, which I 
think is an interesting approach 
to helping students succeed. 
And to be clear, I don’t want 
anyone who runs for CSG to 
fail. Running for a position like 
this asks a lot, and I respect that 
you’ve put yourself out there and 
devoted time to something that, 
at its best, can make meaningful 
impacts on campus.

Your 
platform 
repeatedly 

states that your focus is “taking 
this campus back and giving 
it to the students,” as well as 
making sure the University 
lives up to its name. The thing 
is, your statements, your rap, 
your platform exemplify the 
reasons this campus doesn’t 
feel like home or like it’s living 
up to its potential, for me and 
many other students. If you 
truly want to represent us, 
please take criticism like this 
to heart for your platform as 
well. This, right now, is the 
time to be serious.

Movement, it’s time to get serious

CROWDER

FROM THE DAILY

Vote eMerge

W

ith the upcoming Central Student Government elections, four parties 
— Movement, Better Than the Rest Party, Defend Affirmative 
Action Party and eMerge — vie for the CSG presidential and 

vice presidential positions. Of these parties, The Michigan Daily Editorial 
Board believes that the eMerge party candidates, LSA junior Anushka Sarkar 
and Public Policy junior Nadine Jawad, are the best picks for these offices. 
Between their extensive involvement in CSG and other campus organizations, 
their concrete plans to increase diversity and inclusion on campus and their 
innovative plans to increase community engagement, eMerge has the strongest 
ideas of all the parties and possesses the skills needed to implement these 
plans. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board endorses eMerge presidential 
and vice-presidential candidates Sarkar and Jawad and is confident in their 
abilities to serve in the best interests of our campus community.

 Both Sarkar and Jawad have 

immense experience that would 
allow them to represent the 
student body in a holistic way. 
The candidates’ knowledge of 
the processes and capabilities of 
CSG would allow them to quickly 
get to work when starting their 
term. While serving on CSG, 
Sarkar has spearheaded efforts to 
expand the number of counselors 
at Counseling and Psychological 
Services. Jawad served as a policy 
adviser on CSG and has worked 
to support the needs of students 
with affordable housing. Their 
commitments to CSG — as well as 
the work they’ve done as leaders 
in CSG — are testaments to their 
preparedness for these positions 
and their abilities to create tangible 
change on campus.

The 
eMerge 
party 
would 

best 
represent 
students 
with 

marginalized 
identities 
across 

campus. Sarkar and Jawad have 
shown throughout their proposed 
policies that they are highly 
qualified to construct diverse and 
inclusive dialogues on campus. 
For example, their critique of the 
limitations of the Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion plan proposed by the 
University of Michigan earlier this 
academic year offers hope for those 
unsatisfied with the document.

We are also confident that 

eMerge’s platform points regarding 
diversity would be the most 
successful at impacting campus 
diversity. The candidates have 
acknowledged that their one-year 
terms will never be enough to fully 
tackle diversity across campus and 
in CSG, but they have put together 
a concrete, manageable platform 
that recognizes the struggles of 
students 
of 
underrepresented 

minorities and the past difficulties 
in addressing these issues. Platform 
initiatives, such as working with 
University Health Services to 
accept Medicaid health insurance 
or creating a specific mentorship 
program 
for 
non-traditional, 

first-generation and multilingual 
students, show their commitment 
to diversity in the long term.

The 
Defend 
Affirmative 

Action Party and Movement 
would not be as successful in 
representing student groups. The 
Defend Affirmative Action Party, 
which has shown an engagement 
with a diverse group of students 
on campus, fails to represent 
a majority of students. The 

radical methodology of DAAP, 
such as its collaborations with 
the By Any Means Necessary 
organization, alienates a large 
group of students who do not see 
such tactics as worthwhile.

While Movement candidates 

have expressed care about the 
needs 
of 
minority 
students, 

throughout their campaign they 
have displayed a lack of empathy 
and have failed to listen to 
students of color. The Movement 
candidates have instead pandered 
to the campus community in 
an attempt to create a positive 
image for their campaign, without 
truly 
incorporating 
voices 
of 

minority students. For example, 
their 
“Divide 
and 
Prosper” 

initiative delegates a tangible 
initiative to recruit students of low 
socioeconomic status to students 
enrolled School of Education, 
rather than creating an initiative 
within the scope of Central Student 
Government itself. 

In addition, when asked how 

Movement plans to represent 
students of color, LSA junior 
Dan Sweeney, Movement vice 
presidential candidate, mentioned 
that he does, in fact, listen to 
communities of color on campus. 
 

However, the only example he 
could give was during three weeks 
out of the year while campaigning 
for CSG. We believe that engaging 
with students for three weeks out 
of the year as a campaign tactic is 
far from enough, and a long-term 
dialogue is key. We believe that 
eMerge bridges the ideologies of 
Movement and DAAP by bringing 
together and representing students 
of differing identities.

In addition to their work with 

CSG, the eMerge party candidates 
have demonstrated a significant 
amount 
of 
engagement 
with 

organizations 
across 
campus 

and 
within 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 

community. CSG would benefit 
from Sarkar and Jawad’s strong 
leadership experiences and their 
abilities to manage and organize 
different groups and interests. 
Sarkar 
founded 
Wolverine 

Consulting Group as part of CSG 
that partners with struggling 
student organizations on campus, 
and Jawad co-founded Books for 
a Benefit, a non-governmental 
organization that advocates for 
the importance of literacy, which 
has since spread to other campuses 
across Michigan. 

eMerge’s platform emphasizes 

its commitment to having a student 
voice in the Ann Arbor City 
Council, creating ties between 
our University and the city 
that houses us. The party also 
emphasizes the need for unity and 
engagement across all University 
of Michigan campuses, including 
our satellite locations in Flint 
and Dearborn. The willingness 
to work with all students, in the 
Ann Arbor community and at our 
other campuses, shows eMerge’s 
dedication 
to 
improving 

students’ experiences across all 
University campuses.

The 
lack 
of 
community 

engagement demonstrated by 
the other candidates and their 
platforms gives us reservations. 
While 
Movement’s 
platform 

includes engagement initiatives, 
many are one-time events, such 
as a Thanksgiving food drive 
or their “Mental Health Wake 
Up” initiative. These initiatives 
don’t actively engage students 
on a daily basis at the University, 
instead delegating involvement to 
specific days throughout the year. 
While many of DAAP’s platform 
points would support various 
marginalized communities at the 
University, its focus on initiatives 
from 
an 
activist 
perspective 

will pose problems as its tries to 
implement them. Furthermore, the 
leaders of DAAP are most certainly 
passionate about the issues they 
present, but their emphasis on 
national and international issues 
may limit the scope of students’ 
engagement in their platform. 
eMerge’s platforms parallel the 
positives that come with DAAP’s 
platforms, but are more inclusive 
toward students and members of 
the Ann Arbor community.

The Michigan Daily Editorial 

Board 
enthusiastically 

supports 
eMerge 
and 
the 

incredible ideas presented in 
its platform. The combined 
experience of the candidates, 
which would allow them to 
represent campus diversity, 
would create a culture shift 
that is desperately needed 
within CSG. We hope the goals 
of eMerge are accomplished 
and that Sarkar and Jawad can 
bring our campus together to 
support all students. Be sure 
to vote in CSG elections on 
March 22 and 23 at http://vote.

‘Belko’ puts on a pointless 
display of turgid violence

ORION PICTURES

John Gallagher Jr. stars in new thriller “The Belko Experiment.”

Interesting premise proves chilling but empty, leaving viewers 
without answers to questions broached in new, violent thriller

“The 
Belko 
Experiment” 

starts out promisingly enough. 
The idea of being locked in an 
office and forced to kill your 
fellow employees is chilling, 
and John Gallagher Jr., after 
terrific 
supporting 
work 
in 

“Short 
Term 
12” 
and 
“10 

Cloverfield Lane,” gives a heroic 
and endearingly human central 
performance. The pacing is 
great, defined by long stretches 
of 
tension 
punctuated 
by 

sudden, horrifying violence to 
create an affecting, if familiar, 
portrait of human nature at its 
worst. The absolute high points 
are the interactions between 
the workers, though, as they 
try to levee their workplace 
relationships into positions of 
greater power.

“Belko” is at its best in its 

first half — as it soon abandons 
all semblance of being a smart 
thriller in favor of becoming 
a mindless gorefest. All of the 
shock 
and 
discomfort 
that 

accompanied the violence in 
earlier, better scenes is replaced 
by a numbness. Nothing that 
is portrayed on screen has 
any weight, and this applies 
most of all to the cast. The side 
characters that the audience has 
been following for the entire 
movie are often killed off before 

they are given a chance to affect 
the story in any meaningful way. 
After the umpteenth pointless 
character death, one can only 
wonder why writer James Gunn 
(“Guardians of the Galaxy”) saw 
fit to introduce these characters 
in the first place. Was it a 
misguided attempt to make his 
script feel like it had greater 
stakes than it does? As it is, 
most of them are 
cannon 
fodder, 

extras of a movie 
they 
ostensibly 

star in.

This 
mean-

spiritedness 
takes 
its 
toll 

after 
a 
while, 

and “The Belko 
Experiment” 
becomes a truly joyless slog 
to watch. The moment a dog 
randomly 
shows 
up, 
you 

mentally brace yourself for it 
to die horribly, as well. By the 
third act, it has descended into 
violence for the sake of violence. 
It’s not fun, smart or even all 
that scary. It’s just sadistic. 
Characters 
do 
outrageously 

bloody battle with slogan like 
“Brings the world together” 
painted on the walls behind 
them, because director Greg 
McLean 
(“The 
Darkness”) 

thought blatant irony would 
make the proceedings more 
bearable. It doesn’t.

In fact, for a film written 

by the man behind one of the 
best and funniest comic book 
movies of the last decade, 
“Belko” stumbles in its writing 
more than anywhere else. He 
tries to inject his signature 
humor wherever he can, but 
the jokes, few of which land 
anyway, can’t contend with the 
harsh, dreary atmosphere. The 
natural questions invited by the 

premise cause a 
glut of exposition, 
as 
well, 
and 

no 
matter 
the 

strengths 
of 

the 
performers, 

no 
one 
could 

have 
made 
the 

resulting 
clunky 

dialogue 
sound 

natural.

As “The Belko Experiment” 

draws closer to its conclusion, 
there has been so much build-
up to answers to the questions 
viewers have been asking that 
the eventual answer can’t help 
but be disappointing. There’s 
a climax that, like much of the 
rest of the late-film action, is 
completely hollow, and it ends 
with 
the 
textbook 
sequel-

baiting ending that modern 
horror apparently demands. It 
starts with strong footing and 
ends having fallen flat on its face, 
reaulting in an hour-and-a-half 
of turgid, senseless bloodshed. If 
it was saying something unique, 
it might be more worthwhile.

FILM REVIEW

NETFLIX

Netflix’s new superhero series “Iron Fist.”
‘Iron Fist’ stumbles, fails 
to establish a new identity

Yet another adaptation in Netflix’s string of superhero 
successes, “Iron Fist” doesn’t quite know where it is going

Over the past half-decade, 

superheroes 
have 
come 
to 

dominate 
Hollywood. 
With 

ten superhero films released 
from 2015 to 2016, and another 
25 slated for release through 
2020, there doesn’t appear to 
be an end in sight for comic-
book franchises Marvel and 
CAPCOM. The latest entry into 
this superhero universe comes 
in the form of Netflix’s “Iron 
Fist,” a television adaptation 
of the comic-book series of the 
same name. Slow and lacking 
a clear direction, “Iron Fist” 
struggles to develop an identity 
and craft an entertaining plot 
capable of exciting viewers.

In the series, protagonist 

Danny 
Rand 
(Finn 
Jones, 

“Game of Thrones”) returns to 
his previous home in New York 
City after spending 15 years 
training in martial arts. There, 
Rand discovers that the business 
his father co-founded, Rand 
Corporation, is now ran by his 
father’s unscrupulous former 
business partner, and he sets out 
to regain control of his family’s 
legacy. “Iron Fist” is held back 
by its meandering storyline, 
which is to blame for the show’s 
sluggish 
pace. 
Seemingly 

intent on portraying even the 
most granular, uninteresting 
details of Rand’s life, the series 
gives off a leisurely feel, as 
if it doesn’t care to condense 
anything. Toward the end of 
the show’s premiere, in one of 
the strongest examples of this 
quality, “Iron Fist” devotes a 
whole scene to depicting Rand 
meeting a homeless man named 
Big Al (Craig Walker, “The 
Cobbler”) and using his phone 
to read a news story covering 
the death of his parents 15 years 

prior. Becauase he was on the 
plane crash with his parents, 
Rand is already aware of their 
death, and this — coupled with 
the fact that Big Al later dies in 
the episode — makes the entire 
scene feel utterly unnecessary. 
By subjecting audiences to these 
meaningless bits of Rand’s life, 
“Iron Fist” reveals that it has 
little idea of the type of show 
that it wants to be.

Along with its lack of identity, 

“Iron Fist” suffers from writing 
that often spoon-feeds the plot 
to viewers. Despite its gradual 
pacing, the series 
constantly works 
to 
ensure 
that 

its 
storyline 
is 

clear, oftentimes 
becoming overly 
transparent. 
Ostensibly, 
the show perceives itself as 
confusing, and hopes to avoid 
audiences developing a similar 
sense. In an almost-comically 
bad instance of “Iron Fist” 
spoon-feeding viewers, Rand is 
attacked by the same menacing 
security guard, Shannon (Esau 
Pritchett, 
“The 
Narrows”), 

who he fought earlier in the 
episode. After disarming the 
guard, Rand loudly professes: 
“You’re the security guard from 
Rand [Corporation]” to identify 
Shannon for viewers, but then 
asks him “Who sent you?” not 
five-minutes later. Such lines 
effectively kill “Iron Fist” ’s 
momentum and further dilute 
the show’s quality by preventing 
audiences from experiencing its 
storyline naturally.

Throughout 
its 
marketing 

materials for “Iron Fist,” Netflix 
made a concerted effort to 
highlight Jones’ role as Rand in 
the series. As the poster-boy for 
the show, Jones’ performance 
was used as one of the selling 
points for “Iron Fist,” especially 

given Jones’ strong work on 
“Game of Thrones.” While Jones 
certainly isn’t the weakest link 
of the series’s cast, he doesn’t 
deliver a particularly impressive 
or 
meaningful 
performance, 

and he does little to distinguish 
Rand among Marvel’s growing 
roster 
of 
superheroes. 

Unfortunately, Jones’ slightly 
above-average 
interpretation 

of Rand represents the best of 
the show’s cast, with Jessica 
Stroup (“Prom Night”) and 
Tom 
Pelphrey 
(“Banshee”) 

disappointing as a brother-

sister 
antagonist 

duo. Even Jones’s 
former “Game of 
Thrones” co-star, 
Jessica 
Henwick 

(“Star Wars: The 
Force Awakens”), 
is 
emotionally-

restrained in her role. This cast 
should be better, and it will have 
to improve to keep audience 
members’ engaged with the 
series.

It’s not all bad for “Iron Fist.” 

The show’s cinematography is 
well-done and includes several 
gorgeous shots of New York 
City that portray “Iron Fist” ’s 
diverse backdrop. Avoiding the 
typical cliché sweeping shots 
of the Empire State Building or 
the city skyline, these scenes 
attempt to highlight the city’s 
underbelly and the different 
sides of New York. It’s an 
interesting take, one that serves 
to almost revitalize and rebrand 
a city that has been featured in 
countless superhero films and 
shows alike.

While the show may be visually-

appealing, “Iron Fist” ’s struggles 
with 
plotline 
and 
pacing 

remain, looming large over 
a series that, in its current 
form, doesn’t inspire viewers 
to return beyond the poorly-
executed pilot.

Pop music, sexuality 
and the gay duckling

Intersections of sexuality and music, and the ducks in between

When I was four years old, my 

parents gave each of their three 
sons a pet duck. You can’t do 
much with a pet duck, so most of 
the fun was deciding on a name. 
For weeks, my duckling went 
by two different names: Elvis 
and Britney (Spears, of course). 
Eventually, I firmly settled on 
Britney, and shortly thereafter 
she was attacked by a local clan of 
raccoons and put to rest (may she 
rest in peace).

Fast-forward 15 years: I sat my 

parents down in our living room, 
a short 100 feet away from the 
scene of Britney’s tragedy, and 
told them I was gay. Saying “the 
word” took me a half hour in itself. 
I danced around it, using phrases 
like “my boyfriend” and “dating 
him” instead. I couldn’t decide if I 
wanted to articulate my sexuality 
or not because, just like with 
Britney’s name, I’d always been 
an indecisive kid. My parents had 
hours of questions that evening, 
but I had just as many for myself. 
I remember going back to Ann 
Arbor for my sophomore year, 
looking for answers for both 
myself and my parents thinking, 
“I have absolutely no idea what 
I’m doing.”

It was true, I had no idea what 

being openly gay meant. But I 
knew of someone I could ask for 
help: Britney. No, not Britney the 
duck, not even Britney Spears 
herself, but rather Britney as a 
cultural element — pop stars’ 
emboldening lyrics and the fan 
bases they draw.

I’d always lacked a community 

growing up, never loving sports. 
Pop stars filled that space. Akin 
to how sports unite fans in 
competition, fandom was my 
sport. I was a “Little Monster,” 
which meant that I rooted for 
Lady Gaga to “win,” whether it 
was beating Katy Perry on the 
charts or besting Madonna in 
critical acclaim. As sports fans 
read player stats, I researched 
chart positions. Pop star feuds 
were 
my 
March 
Madness 

brackets, Pharrell Williams and 
Max Martin my Harbaugh.

Fandom gave me the same 

sense 
of 
competition 
and 

camaraderie my friends on the 
football team had, and I developed 
a love for the communities each 
artist fostered. When summer 
came around, and subsequently 
pop music albums were released, 
I pledged allegiance to a team; 
was I a player in Rihanna’s Navy, 
Beyonce’s Beyhive or even Taylor 
Swift’s Swifties? Regardless of 
whose colors I wore, in each team 
I experienced a culture that was 
inclusive, fun and, often times, 

very queer.

Vibrant stan culture aside, the 

pop stars I fell in love with offered 
music that made me feel normal. 
Their lyrics were empowering 
and loud — two adjectives I 
lacked as a closeted kid in a rural 
Midwestern town. Pop surges 
with 
strong 
beats, 
inspiring 

statements and 
bold 
outfits; 

these 
flooded 

me 
with 
a 

multisensory 
wave of distilled 
confidence. 
I’d 
grown 
up 

obsessing 
over 

pop 
music 

behemoths 
like 
Michael 

Jackson, 
Lady 

Gaga and Prince, 
all artists whose 
grandeur 
and 

pounding 
synthesizers 
injected 
confidence into 
my 
self-image 

that it lacked on its own.

Prince’s Purple Rain — the 

first album I purchased when 
my dad gave me his old turntable 
— blurred the lines of sexuality 
and gender, and made me feel 
okay to be confused. In “I Would 
Die 4 U,” Prince, an artist both 
accepted by mainstream culture 

and generally deemed “straight,” 
opens with “I’m not a woman, I’m 
not a man, I am something you’ll 
never understand.” I replayed 
that introduction hundreds of 
time on my iPod Classic, thinking 
if mainstream ’80s pop music 
can accept these lyrics, then 21st 
century society has to be OK with 

me.

Even 
more 

influential 
was 

Lady 
Gaga’s 

Born This Way. 
When 
it 
was 

released, I was 
in 9th grade and 
finally beginning 
to 
associate 

the word with 
how I felt about 
guys. Songs like 
“Hair” preached 
individuality, 
with 
Gaga 

belting, “I just 
wanna be myself 
/ And I want you 
to love me for 
who I am” — I 

couldn’t have said it any more 
directly myself. Gaga’s album 
exuded love, a feeling I needed 
during a time in my life when I 
felt displaced. Born This Way was 
monumental, both critically and 
on the charts, and its widespread 
international recognition helped 
me entertain the concept that 

society would accept me if I was 
to come out; it was the catalyst for 
owning my sexuality.

Pop music wasn’t just an 

internal inspiration though — it 
also gave me tangible friendships. 
This past summer, I packed up 
my brother’s red Ford Focus and 
drove from Michigan to L.A. I’d 
never set foot in the city of Los 
Angeles before, and the number 
of people I knew in Southern 
California could barely be counted 
on one hand. I was scared.

The first few weeks were 

lonely; I had no friends and no 
known avenues to meet people. 
I’d come home from work, make 
dinner and binge-watch “Gilmore 
Girls” (I finished all seven seasons 
in less than three weeks). With 
“Gilmore Girls” finished, I had to 
stop moping and take the advice a 
friend of mine: To not be afraid to 
do things alone.

That week, I met a friend-of-

a-friend for a beach concert and 
began chatting with some of her 
work friends — Katy Perry had just 
dropped a single right as Britney 
debuted “Make Me… ,” and fan-
bases were shocked, pitting the 
Britney Army against KatyCats 
(?!). This offensive single release 
tactic wasn’t new to KatyCats, 
as they’d fought a similar battle 
when Katy released “Roar” in 
conjunction with Lady Gaga’s 
“Applause” in 2013. Katy cut into 

Gaga’s downloads significantly, 
tainting the entire album release.

When 
I 
received 
a 
text 

about the #drama, I let out an 
“ohmygosh” under my breath. 
Concerned, 
the 
friend-of-a-

friend asked if everything was 
okay, so I gave him the update. 
Immediately, his face flushed: 
“How could Katy do that to 
Britney? I’m SHOOK!”

The stranger, named Caleb, 

ended up being one of my best 
friends for the summer. I went 
from watching five episodes of 
“Gilmore Girls” a night alone 
to spending every weekend on 
Santa Monica Blvd, where gay 
bars played music by the very 
artists that inspired me to go 
there in the first place. My L.A. 
experience completely changed 
because of that simple pop star 
interaction.

Whenever I reflect on coming 

out, I think of Britney (the duck). 
I so badly wanted to name her 
Britney, but it would’ve been 
more socially appropriate to 
name her Elvis. This dilemma 
served as an important precursor 
for my life rolling forward — the 
notion that my love for music 
and my identity as a gay man are 
inseparable. In a way, with every 
new person I meet and every 
new workplace I enter, I make 
a decision. More often than not 
now, I choose Britney over Elvis.

How lucky is it that, for 

whatever reason, every once 
in awhile fate and timing meld 
together in serendipitous chance 
to present opportunity?

(There’s a right answer to this: 

extremely lucky.)

To disregard these instances is 

complete nonsense, but it’s a trap 
I fall into sometimes — too many 
times. Actually, all the time.

Directed 
by 
Nick 
Vitale, 

Michael Schwartz and story-
writer 
Tyler 
Nilson, 
“The 

Moped Diaries” (2014) is a 
heartbreakingly 
stunning 

depiction 
of 
one 
man’s 

tumultuous 
coming-of-age 

journey through all the ways 
love kicked him in the shin and 
picked him back up again.

The 11-minute narrative short 

film follows Levi, a young boy 
growing up on Colington Island 
right off the coast of North 
Carolina, through the literal and 
spiritual losses of his parents, 
his brother and his first love. 
Familial love, romantic love, 
self-love; the story takes turns 
swiping each away from Levi, 
leaving one void to be filled by 
another.

At the end of his grief and 

the beginning of his resolution, 
Levi doesn’t just take a chance 
on his life; he takes a chance 
on 
himself. 
Having 
grown 

up to experience the utterly 
shattering, beautifully wretched 
sides of relationships, he takes 
to his moped in a moment of 
intense clarity. Now, an adult 
with nowhere to go, he finds 
solace in the fact that the only 
place to move is forward. In 
the last couple minutes of the 
short, a Wes Anderson-esque 
sequence of events unfolds as 
Nilson voices what my heart 
always knew and my mind was 

too afraid to think: “You have 
to step out into the unknown 
and just pray the road will rise 
to meet you. And it will. It has 
to.”

For an inexcusable length 

of my life, I’ve pushed off 
applying for this or going after 
that with the mindset: What 
if the reality I’ve dreamed of 
attaining isn’t what I thought 
it would be? Or worse, what 
if I’m not well-suited for it? 
Constantly waiting for hopes 
to become experiences, I have 
allowed flashes of outstanding 

harmony to slip away into 
“should haves” or “what ifs.”

I’m terrified of the abyss of 

life because, more than just 
being inherently daunting, it’s 
intangibly promising. Of all 
the lessons Levi’s adventure 
taught me, one that sticks out 
most prominently is this: To 
let heartaches of the past or 
anxieties for the future dictate 
current choices is a miraculous 
misuse of the present.

The summer of 2014, I 

was frantically searching for 
something to do with myself 
when I was struck with a 
moment of not wanting to do 

anything at all. I wasn’t lazy; I was 
scared. I had my eye on a writing 
program in Chicago (rather, I had 
my heart on a writing program in 
Chicago), and being the dramatic, 
angsty teen I was, I was stuck in 
a state of perpetually questioning 
my own abilities. If I went to 
this program and I was an epic, 
absolute, fantastic failure — well 
that would really suck. But for 
the first time in my life, I wasn’t 
an idiot, and I actually applied 
for this experience.

So, I went, and I wasn’t the 

worst at it. Finally ignoring the 
voice in my head that forever 
thrived on repressing my real 
dreams for the ones I thought 
were more practical, I finally 
hurdled into the type of world I 
only ever wished I could live in.

Something I have had to 

learn the hard way is that 
there’s no right time to start 
being the person I’ve always 
wanted to be. The notion that 
I’m waiting for some optimal 
moment in which I can launch 
my life is ridiculous. It has just 
been a way for me to fool myself 
into believing that indulging in 
the fear of living is somehow 
OK. I call bullshit on all of it.

There’s no perfect moment 

for anything. Perfection is 
strived toward and worked for, 
but it doesn’t actually exist. If it 
did, the art of risk-taking would 
disappear. No one in this world 
has ever achieved anything by 
sitting around and waiting for 
life to happen to them, and 
the future is only as full as 
you allow yourself to make it. 
The greatest experiences are 
a result of surrendering to the 
wildest possibilities.

Tragedy 
doesn’t 
spare 

anyone, but neither does joy. I 
might as well stop fearing the 
abyss because the abyss will 
not cease to exist until I do. At 
some point, at this point, I’ve 
just got to strap on my helmet, 
get on my moped and begin.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

Third album You’re Not As ____ As You Think pushes 
modern emo forward as the band reaches new heights

Sorority Noise is a really sad 

band — at least that’s exactly 
what every other thinkpiece 
seems to deem their defining 
quality. Sorority Noise seem 
to be constantly associated 
with depressing lyrics cloaked 
in pop-rock. This, however, 
is a base look at a band that 
has proven to be much more 
complex than simply “sad.”

On 
their 
third 
album, 

You’re 
Not 
As 
_____ 
As 

You 
Think, 
Sorority 
Noise 

continues to dabble in hope 
and self-improvement, writing 
incredibly catchy songs with 
sing-along 
choruses, 
but 

frontman Cam Boucher has 
begun to move outside his own 
head by reflecting on the world 
around him and his place within 
it. Like Boucher’s most recent 
release Slow Burn (from his 
heavier project Old Gray) the 

album largely deals with death, 
but it is less depressing than it 
is thoughtful and uplifting.

The 
album 
opener 
“No 

Halo” follows the story of 
Boucher visiting the home of 
a friend who had committed 
suicide 
a 
year 
earlier. 

Boucher takes this morose 
tale and gives it a hauntingly 
human 
contemplation 
on 

existentialism. “So when you 
show up to my funeral / Will 
you be wearing white or black?” 
asks 
Boucher 

— 
questions 

whether 
death 

should 
be 

celebratory 
or 
mournful. 

Boucher 
has 

proved 
his 

impressive 
growth 
in 

his 
skillful 

songwriting 
since the band’s debut album 
Forgettable. Moving beyond the 
basic self-loathing associated 
with emo music, Boucher asks 
questions about this sadness, 
forcing the listener into his 
head to contemplate what he 
contemplates.

Boucher opens the most 

anthemic track on the record 
“Disappeared” with “I took 
some time to myself / To sort 
out all the things that make 
me feel the way that I feel.” 
With this track, Boucher again 
asks questions by reflecting 
about 
the 
permanence 
of 

death — the complete severing 
of a personal connection and 
how viscerally it can be felt. 
It’s the beginning of a lightly 
sung track that builds into an 
explosive chorus: a technique 
that Sorority Noise has nearly 
perfected. 
Boucher 
knows 

exactly how to craft a song that 
begs for deafening sing-alongs, 
a common occurrence at nearly 
every Sorority Noise show I’ve 
attended.

The album also features 

an 
interestingly 
tongue-in-

cheek 
religious 
undertone. 

Multiple 
songs 
reference 

Christian figures in a light-
hearted 
manner. 
From 

“shooting jumpers with Jesus, 
Mary, and Joseph” to angels 

“drinking 
up 
whiskey 
and 

cokes,” Boucher unabashedly 
reveals his carefree attitude 
of the afterlife and religion, 
and this nonchalance feels 
fits comfortably in the album. 
At his most raw take on 
religion, Boucher pokes fun 
at circumstantial misfortune 
with the line “It’s been awhile 
since I’ve seen God / And I’m 
not trying to lead him on / But 
he’s always trying to fuck me to 
the tune of my favorite song.” 

Boucher expertly 
ties 
humor 

and 
sadness 
in 

reflections, 
and 

the 
lines 
shine 

brightly 
among 

the pop melodies.

Still, 
Sorority 

Noise 
hasn’t 

turned its back 
on 
the 
tender, 

quiet 
tunes 

they’re also known for. “A 
Better Sun” softly sends nods 
to 
Boucher’s 
friends 
and 

influences in Modern Baseball, 
Julien Baker and many others. 
In an interview with Uproxx, 
Boucher notes that this track 
stems from his education in 
jazz music, showcasing his 
diverse, multi-faceted approach 
to songwriting by applying 
jazz principles to the acoustic 
side of his music. “Leave The 
Fan On” is most similar to the 
tense “Your Soft Blood” from 
their sophomore record Joy, 
Departed. These tracks act as a 
jarring pacemaker, reminding 
the 
listener 
that 
Boucher 

isn’t immune to the more 
melancholic side of existence.

As You Think is an album 

that is fully on par with what 
we know from Sorority Noise. 
On the surface, it’s a diverse, 
fun album to listen to. But 
at its core, it is a haunting 
look at the human reaction 
to death. As the members of 
Sorority 
Noise 
continue 
to 

develop as musicians, they’ve 
grown beyond a genre that can 
easily pigeonhole artists to 
less prolific work. Their third 
record is an exciting milestone 
in modern emo, and with it 
Sorority Noise has begun to 
cement its place at the top.

ICE HOCKEY

BASEBALL
Pitching staff taking
shape for Wolverines

After a stellar performance 

over spring break in California, 
the Michigan baseball team 
could feel confident in its team, 
especially those on the mound.

Highlights from the trip out 

west included the Wolverine 
pitching staff – led by junior 
right-hander Ryan Nutof – 
notching 
12 
strikeouts 
in 

the game against Southern 
California to tie a season 
high. 
Even 
in 
Michigan’s 

heartbreaking loss to UCLA, 
the strong effort from junior 
left-hander Oliver Jaskie on 
the mound – where he pitched 
six scoreless innings, struck 
out six batters 
and 
allowed 

four walks and 
just three hits 
– was a silver 
lining for the 
team.

But 
when 

the Wolverines 
returned 
to 

Ray 
Fisher 

Stadium 
for 

their 
opening 

weekend 
at 
home 
against 

Northern Illinois, they didn’t 
exit the weekend with the 
same confidence they entered 
with.

In the first inning of the 

series Thursday, Jaskie walked 
one batter in four pitches and 
gave up two hits and two runs. 
Fortunately for Michigan, the 
lefty eventually pulled out the 
win due to an offensive surge 
by his teammates.

Nutof was the starter for 

the second game of the series 
Saturday and didn’t have any 
more success than Jaskie. He 
allowed eight hits and seven 
runs through 4.2 innings to 
make him 1-1 on the year.

After a sluggish start to the 

series, Sunday’s doubleheader 
returned 
some 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ optimism in the 
pitching staff. Twelve pitchers 

saw the field and gained 
crucial experience going into 
Big Ten play this weekend.

“We got a lot of guys some 

opportunities,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “I thought 
it was important to give some 
guys that haven’t pitched in 
a while, we’ve got some guys 
who haven’t pitched since 
California, spring break, that 
needed some innings, needed 
to face another jersey.

“And so to get them back out 

there and see them compete, I 
thought everyone who went in 
there did a good job.”

Even those players that 

were only in the game for an 
inning were still able to make 
a difference. Freshman right-

hander 
Karl 

Kauffman came 
in as a reliever 
for 1.1 innings, 
but only gave 
up one hit and 
earned 
two 

strikeouts.

“I 
thought 

everybody 
did a good job 
attacking 
the 

strike zone and 

letting their defense make 
plays behind them,” Bakich 
said.

Not every pitcher had to rely 

on the defense, though. Senior 
right-hander Mac Lozer came 
into the game in the seventh 
inning and stayed in for just 
0.2 innings. Of the two batters 
he faced, he sent both of them 
back into the dugout while 
his team just stood by and 
watched. 

While the relievers proved 

to be mostly successful, many 
threw only minimal pitches. 
The experience was good, but 
most of them entered late in 
the game when the Wolverines 
had the lead as a cushion. 
Entering 
conference 
play 

might test the relievers more 
and force the starters to come 
out focused right from the 
first pitch.

Michigan learning to win close games in WNIT

In each of the past two 

seasons, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s stated goal of 
securing a berth in the NCAA 
Tournament was derailed by one 
common factor: losses in close 
games. 

Last year, the Wolverines 

dropped six contests by 10 or 
fewer points, which ultimately 
relegated 
them 
to 
the 

Women’s National Invitation 
Tournament. While Michigan 
had just three similar defeats 
this season, a 76-75 loss at 
Penn State in the last game 
of the regular season is likely 
what doomed the Wolverines’ 
tournament hopes.

But one encouraging sign 

has 
emerged 
in 
Michigan’s 

WNIT wins over Kent State on 
Thursday and Wright State on 
Saturday. In both games, the 
Wolverines withstood a late 
surge by the other team and held 

on for a victory.

“Survive and advance,” said 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “I think in a tournament 
it’s a great experience to be put 
in this position. I think that will 
definitely give us confidence 
moving forward.”

Against the Golden Flashes, 

Michigan raced out to a 43-22 
halftime advantage thanks in 
large part to its suffocating 
defense. Kent State converted a 
mere 18.8 percent of its shots in 
the first two quarters.

Then the Golden Flashes 

started making shots, which 
allowed them to pull within five 
points of the Wolverines with 
two minutes left in the game. 
It appeared Michigan’s season 
might have been heading for a 
disastrous finish.

The Wolverines lived to play 

another day, though. Senior 
guard Siera Thompson sank 
four free throws and freshman 
guard Kysre Gondrezick made 
a layup in the waning minutes, 

propelling Michigan to a 67-60 
triumph.

The situation was even scarier 

for the Wolverines against the 
Raiders. Michigan built another 
20-point lead in the first half, but 
Wright State fought back to take 
a 64-63 edge with just under 
five minutes left in the fourth 
quarter. Michigan’s season was 
on the line once more.

This time, it was sophomore 

center Hallie Thome and junior 
forward Jillian Dunston to the 
rescue for the Wolverines. The 
duo combined for six points 
down the stretch and secured a 
71-66 win for Michigan.

“Fatigue is just a state of mind. 

You can always push through it,” 
Dunston said. “I think it was 
just, things were going our way 
and then we kind of let things 
slip that we don’t normally.”

For now, the Wolverines’ goal 

is to win the WNIT. It would be 
a noteworthy accomplishment, 
as it would allow Michigan to 
hang its first banner in Crisler 

Center.

But the WNIT games also 

provide 
the 
Wolverines 
an 

opportunity 
to 
think 
about 

long-term 
aspirations. 
Four 

of 
Michigan’s 
five 
starters 

— including all three of its 
All-Big 
Ten 
players 
— 
are 

scheduled to return next season. 
Undoubtedly, securing an NCAA 
berth and erasing the sting from 
this year’s snub will be priority 
number one for the returning 
players.

If the Wolverines can learn 

from the experience of winning 
these close WNIT games, and 
turn contests like the Penn State 
loss into wins, Michigan will 
have a very good chance to go 
dancing at this time next year.

“We 
were 
put 
in 
these 

situations plenty of times last 
year and we didn’t get a single 
(game),” Dunston said. “This 
year we’ve learned to deal with 
it. There’s been a ton of growth 
from last year. Everyone is a year 
older.”

Hutchins hits 1,500-win milestone

In locking up a routine 

run-rule victory over Kent 
State, 
11-3, 
in 
the 
first 

game of a doubleheader on 
Sunday, 
Michigan 
coach 

Carol Hutchins became the 
first college softball coach in 
history to reach 1,500 career 
wins.

But after the game, senior 

centerfielder Kelly Christner 
and junior first baseman Aidan 
Falk — brows raised — shared a 
bewildered look upon hearing 
the news.

“I 
didn’t 
even 
know,” 

Christner said.

“We had no clue,” Falk 

added.

Hutchins 
flies 
under 

the 
radar 
as 
much 
as 
a 

coach 
with 
her 
pedigree 

can. The magnitude of her 
accomplishments can often go 
unnoticed, often by her own 
insistence.

“I just want to win the 

game,” Hutchins said. “The 
only game I care about is the 
game we’re playing. I don’t 
count wins. I don’t win any 
games. I’m just the coach, they 
win the games.”

After a momentary pause 

to allow for proper context, 
though, Christner emphasized 
the 
low-profile 
nature 
of 

Hutchins’ 
monumental 

accomplishment.

“The fact that none of us 

even knew that it was her 
1,500th… I think that says a lot 
about her as a coach, that she’s 
not worried about that, she 
doesn’t care about that. She’s 
focused on the team we have 
right now.”

While Hutchins is quick to 

deflect the credit of her big-
picture feat to her players, the 
nitty gritty of her coaching 
prowess lies in the smaller 
details throughout each game.

With the offense sputtering 

in the fourth inning of the 
final game of the weekend in 

what seemed to be another 
lackluster performance against 
Kent State ace Ronnie Ladines 
— who held it to just two hits in 
Saturday’s contest — Hutchins 
held a lengthy meeting with 
the whole team outside the 
dugout. Her demeanor in the 
huddle signaled an unhappy 
tone.

“I think (the meeting) was 

more just talking about our 
at-bats and how we really 
needed to see the ball deep and 
let the ball get there because 
we were all just early,” Falk 
said. “So that was the main 
focus, just on the offensive 
side. I think after that we did 
pick it up.”

Added Hutchins: “I know 

how well these kids can hit. 
I watch them every day, and 
they’ve been tight endlessly 
throughout the season and 
trying too hard, and it’s not 
working for us. So they really 
need to just relax and believe 
that 
their 
swings’ 
good 

enough.”

And when she talks, the 

Wolverines listen.

The 
Michigan 
offense 

immediately responded in the 
bottom of the fourth inning to 
break the 0-0 tie. Falk keyed a 
3-run rally with a slicing double 
down the left field line to score 
the first two runs of the game. 
The 3-run inning would be 
plenty for Michigan ace Megan 
Betsa, 
who 
completed 
her 

second shutout of the weekend 
in the Wolverines’ 3-0 win.

In 
the 
first 
inning 
of 

the 
second 
game 
of 
the 

doubleheader, Christner — who, 
prior to the game, hadn’t had 
a hit in her last nine at bats — 
fouled off a pitch down the first 
base line. The lefty immediately 
turned her attention to the 
third base side, where Hutchins 
was flailing her body and 
arms in a swinging motion, 
as if to symbolize Christner’s 
imbalance at the plate.

Christner’s single in the 

bottom of the fourth — notably 
to the opposite field — was key 

to the three-run Wolverine 
rally that would prove more 
than 
enough 
to 
extend 

Hutchins’ win total to 1,501.

Inarguably one of the most 

— if not the most — successful 
coaches in softball history, 
Hutchins’ 
accomplishments 

speak for themselves.

Thirty-three 
seasons 

and 
1,501 
wins. 
Twlelve 

Women’s College World Series 
appearances. Nineteen Big Ten 
titles. The winningest coach in 
Michigan athletic and NCAA 
softball history.

But to Falk and Christner, 

their coach means a whole lot 
more than just her numbers.

“It’s kind of us taking it as 

it goes and really embracing 
what we have—what we’re 
blessed to have — that a lot of 
other teams dont,” Falk said. 
“I think (Hutchins is) making 
us better women as well. 
Everyday that we come in here, 
I can feel myself being better 
— being a better person, being 
better overall.”

Kile signs pro contract

On Monday, it was announced 

that Alex Kile of the Michigan 
hockey team signed a contract 
with the Rochester Americans of 
the American Hockey League for 
the 2017-18 season. The former 
Wolverine will also finish the 
remainder of this season with 
the Americans on an Amateur 
Tryout.

The news comes less than 

a week after Michigan’s 4-1 
loss to No. 11 Penn State in the 
first round of 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament. 
The 
loss 

officially ended 
Kile’s 
college 

career 
— 
an 

ending 
that 

he 
would 
be 

the 
first 
to 

admit 
was 

unexpected.

As 
one 
of 

two 
captains 

and the team’s returning leader 
in points, the senior forward 
entered the year as the new face 
of the Michigan hockey team. 
Expectations were thrust upon 
him to help carry the Wolverine 
offense — a unit that suffered 
drastic 
losses 
from 
NHL 

departures following the 2015-
16 season.

Kile (and Michigan), though, 

could never quite seem to get 
going. He tallied just 14 points 
— his lowest output since his 
freshman year — while dealing 
with 
multiple 
injuries 
that 

limited his playing time.

Despite the difficulties of 

his senior year, there were still 
moments when Kile flashed signs 
of the player many expected him 
to be. Against Michigan Tech on 
Oct. 22, Kile recorded his first 

goal of the season in a stunning 
fashion, deking past multiple 
defensemen — sliding to his 
knees in the process — before 
putting one past the goaltender. 
Three of his seven goals on the 
year came against in-state rival 
Michigan State. And in a 5-3 
win over then-No. 5 Minnesota 
on March 3, Kile turned in 
a 
masterful 
performance, 

recording one goal and two 
assists.

And while his career at 

Michigan is now over, Kile will 
get a chance to prove his senior 

season was just 
a 
fluke 
almost 

immediately with 
Rochester.

The Americans 

— 
an 
affiliate 

of 
the 
Buffalo 

Sabres 
— 
are 

getting a player 
who 
worked 

hard to improve 
his craft over his 
four years in Ann 
Arbor. As part of 

a large and impressive recruiting 
class, Kile flew under the radar 
as an undrafted player. He had to 
fight to find ice time in his first 
year, carving out a part-time 
role and appearing in 28 games, 
where he tallied four goals and 
two assists.

He had a breakout campaign 

the 
following 
year 
as 
a 

sophomore, recording 13 goals 
and assists each, before reaching 
career-highs of 16 goals and 
18 assists as a junior, helping 
his team return to the NCAA 
Tournament.

Kile remained close with his 

classmates, even as some — like 
JT Compher, Tyler Motte and 
Michael Downing — chose to 
leave early for the NHL. Now, 
he’ll have a shot to join them at 
the next level.

Breaking down the Sweet Sixteen

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team defeated No. 2 
Louisville, 73-69, on Sunday — 
clinching a spot in the Sweet 16 
of the NCAA Tournament.

Now, the Wolverines will 

travel to Kansas City to take on 
No. 3 Oregon before potential 
matchups with No. 1 Kansas or 
a rematch with No. 4 Purdue, a 
team that Michigan has already 
beaten twice this season.

The Daily breaks down all 

eight games that will take place 
either Thursday or Friday for 
spots in the Elite Eight.

Midwest Region - Kansas 

City, Mo.

No. 7 Michigan vs No. 3 

Oregon

If the Wolverines’ run to 

the Sweet 16 isn’t impressive 
enough, the way they have done 
so certainly is.

In its first-round matchup 

with Oklahoma State, Michigan 
dialed shots up from beyond 
the arc time and time again. 
After sinking 11-of-15 from 
deep in the second half, the 
Wolverines managed to win a 
shootout against the Cowboys 
— who entered the game as the 
top-ranked team in adjusted 
offensive efficiency according 
to Ken Pomeroy.

And 
on 
Sunday, 
the 

Wolverines 
kept 
rolling, 

defeating 
the 
Cardinals 
at 

Bankers Life Fieldhouse to 
give John Beilein his first win 
against Rick Pitino since 2005. 
Unlike Friday’s matchup, this 
time, Michigan pounded the 
paint. 
Sophomore 
forward 

Moritz Wagner finished with 
a game-high 26 
points on 11-for-
14 shooting — 
becoming 
the 

first Wolverine 
to 
score 
25 

points 
on 
75 

percent shooting 
in 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament 
since 
Chris 

Webber did so in 
1993.

Michigan 

keeps finding more and more 
ways to score, and that is far 
from an encouraging sign for a 
sputtering Oregon team.

The Ducks got into the Sweet 

16 by the skin of their teeth 
— eking out a 75-72 win over 
Rhode Island with the help 
of Tyler Dorsey’s 3-pointer 
with 38 seconds left to play. 
Through its first two games 
of the tournament, though, 

Oregon 
has 
reeled 
in 
76 

rebounds. Though 41 of those 
came against No. 14 seed Iona, 
if there’s a key to attacking the 
Wolverines it’s on the glass.

No. 1 Kansas vs No. 4 

Purdue

If Michigan can manage 

to get by the 
Ducks, 
it 
will 

face the winner 
of Kansas and 
Purdue in the 
Elite Eight.

Purdue 

forward 
Caleb 

Swanigan 
continues 
to 

show 
why 
he 

was 
the 
Big 

Ten 
Player 
of 

the Year, as he 

scored 36 points and grabbed 
26 boards through the opening 
weekend. More notably, 20 
of those points and 12 of the 
rebounds came against No. 5 
seed Iowa State. With Isaac 
Haas also at the Boilmakers’ 
disposal, they will likely try 
to counteract the Jayhawks’ 
strong guard play.

That will be easier said than 

done.

When it comes to Kansas, 

there may not be a hotter team 
in 
basketball. 
Between 
its 

matchups with UC Davis and 
Michigan State, the Jayhawks 
have won by an average margin 
of 29. Guards Frank Mason 
III and Josh Jackson continue 
to 
thrive, 
as 

the 
two 
are 

averaging 21 and 
20 
points 
per 

game 
through 

the 
opening 

weekend, 
respectively.

This one will 

come down to 
whether or not 
Purdue can flip 
Kansas’ 
game 

plan on its head, 
but with the way the Jayhawks 
are playing, that isn’t looking 
likely.

No. 8 Wisconsin vs No. 4 

Florida

Comparing the paths these 

two teams took to the Big Apple 
almost seems unfair. Florida 
would have been expected to 
play at Madison Square Garden. 

Wisconsin is lucky to have 
made it out of Buffalo.

After losing in the first 

round of the SEC Tournament, 
the Gators had five days of 
rest before their first NCAA 
Tournament matchup. Facing 
No. 13 East Tennessee State and 

No. 5 Virginia 
in its opening 
weekend, 
Florida 
had 

no 
trouble 

dispatching 
either opponent, 
toppling 
both 

by a combined 
41-point margin.

Meanwhile, 

the 
Badgers 

needed to make 
five free throws 

in the final 37 seconds to beat 
No. 9 Virginia Tech, and then 
snuck past No. 1 overall seed 
Villanova off a go-ahead layup 
from forward Nigel Hayes with 
just 12 seconds left.

Both 
have 
a 
reasonable 

degree 
of 
momentum, 
as 

the Gators are on a roll and 
Wisconsin is used to tough 
contests. Whichever team can 
generate the most Friday night 
will likely stick around for 
another game in New York City.

No. 3 Baylor vs No. 7 South 

Carolina

Both of these teams have 

faced a mixed bag of ease and 
adversity 
in 
their 
opening 

weekend of the tournament. 
From blowing out their first 
opponents to outlasting their 
subsequent foes, Baylor and 
South Carolina seem to be on a 
similar trajectory despite being 
four seeds apart.

The Bears and Gamecocks 

posted nearly identical scores 
in their first round matchups, 
as Baylor defeated No. 14 New 
Mexico State, 91-73, and South 
Carolina beat No. 10 Marquette, 
93-73.

In the second round, the 

Bears pulled away from No. 11 
USC in the final five minutes 
and the Gamecocks surged past 
No. 2 Duke in the second half. 
The major difference in that 
regard is South Carolina pulled 
off the upset while Baylor was 
almost upset itself.

Though both sides are ranked 

in the top 50 for scoring margin, 
the Bears have the advantage 
at 10.1 to the Gamecocks’ 7.9. 
However, South Carolina might 
have another upset in store 
Friday.

South Region - Memphis, 

Tenn.

No. 1 North Carolina vs No. 

4 Butler

North Carolina and Butler 

are two teams coming off polar 
opposite games in the second 
round. The Tar Heels barely 
squeaked by No. 9 Arkansas in a 
game where they trailed by five 
with three minutes remaining. 
But off the back of 19 points 
from forward Kennedy Meeks, 
the Tar Heels prevailed.

Butler, on the other hand, 

is coming off a relatively easy 
victory over No. 12 Middle 
Tennessee, 
shooting 
51.1 

percent in the game and 53.3 
percent from behind the arc.

The Tar Heels will have the 

size advantage, giving them the 
upper hand on 
the boards. But 
if the Bulldogs 
continue 
to 

shoot well, as 
they 
have 
in 

the tournament 
so far, North 
Carolina could 
be in trouble.

No. 3 UCLA 

vs 
No. 
2 

Kentucky

Kentucky 

and UCLA are both coming 
off tough matchups against 
double-digit 
seeds 
with 

wins over No. 10 Wichita 
State and No. 11 Cincinnati, 
respectively, 
in 
the 
second 

round. The two teams have 
met already once this season, 
with the Bruins pulling off a 
97-92 upset in Lexington with 
UCLA forward TJ Leaf putting 
on 
a 
spectacular 
17-point, 

13-rebound performance.

Three months later, the two 

teams will meet again, when 
the 
stakes 

will be much 
greater than a 
non-conference 
game 
in 

December. 
The Bruins are 
coming 
off 
a 

game 
where 

their 
star 

point 
guard 

Lonzo Ball had 
arguably 
his 

best performance in the past 
month, putting up a statline of 
18 points and 9 assists — all of 
which came in the second half — 
to lead UCLA past the Bearcats.

Kentucky 
survived 
a 

nailbiter over the Shockers, in 
which the Wildcats’ freshmen 
trio of guards Malik Monk and 
De’Aaron Fox and forward Bam 
Adebayo led the team to victory.

Look for the battle between 

the point guards (Fox and Ball) 
to dictate the pace of the game. 
Both teams play up tempo and 
score a lot of points, which was 
evident in their last matchup, 
and will make for one of the 
more entertaining of the eight 
games to watch.

West Regional - San Jose, 

Calif.

No. 1 Gonzaga vs. No. 4 

West Virginia

On paper it’s looking like 

Thursday’s matchup between 
the Bulldogs and Mountaineers 
is going to be a low-scoring 
affair. Gonzaga has the nation’s 
No. 1 scoring defense, while 
West Virginia forces opposing 
offenses into committing more 
turnovers than any other team 
in the country.

The 
Mountaineers 

experienced some drama in 
the first weekend, pulling out 
a tight contest against Bucknell 
with a six-point win, and 
followed that up with a more 
comfortable 12-point victory 
over 
Notre 
Dame. 
Junior 

point guard Jevon Carter had 

24 
points 
in 

the later of the 
Mountaineers’ 
wins. 
His 

matchup 
with 

Gonzaga 
point 

guard 
Nigel 

Williams-Goss 
promises to be 
entertaining and 
to largely shape 
what happens in 
Thursday’s game.

The 
Bulldogs 

nearly blew a 22-point lead 
against Northwestern over the 
weekend, and are hoping that 
close one can be a wakeup call 
for the team that lost just once 
in the regular season. Gonzaga 
will need more from its 7-foot-
1 center Przemek Karnowski, 
who scored just nine points 
versus 
the 
Wildcats. 
He’s 

expected to be the key player 
for the Bulldogs against an 
undersized 
West 
Virginia 

squad.

No. 2 Arizona vs. No. 11 

Xavier

The 

Musketeers 
are 

the tournament’s 
lowest remaining 
seed, but proved 
against 
No. 
3 

seed Florida State 
they are capable 
of taking anyone 
down. In one of 
the 
most 
one-

sided games of the 

second round, Xavier absolutely 
blew 
out 
the 
Seminoles. 

Forward Trevon Bluiett led the 
way for the Musketeers with 29 
points. That was Bluiett’s encore 
performance to a 21-point night 
in Xavier’s first round matchup 
with Maryland.

But 
the 
Wildcats 
have 

multiple players who have the 
talent and ability to put an end 
to Bluiett’s hot streak. Forward 
Rawle 
Alkins 
and 
guard 

Alonzo Trier have contained 
some of the Pac-12’s best small 
forwards all season long, and 
will hope to do the same with 
Bluiett and score some points at 
the same time. Forward Lauri 
Markkanen posted a double-
double in Arizona’s second 
round game with St. Mary’s 
with 16 points and 11 rebounds, 
and will look to have another 
efficient day at the post.

The 
Musketeers 
do 
play 

a stretch-four, which could 
challenge Markkanen and the 
Wildcats on the perimeter. But 
Arizona has enough weapons 
to neutralize that threat, and 
can do so with both solid post 
play and outside shooting that 
could be too much for Xavier to 
overcome.
