Lecture examines Rwanda

New president,
vice president to be
announced after

By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily Staff Reporter
On top of an already eventful
week for the Central Student Gov-
ernment, students were left wait-
ing early Friday morning as CSG
presidential election results were
delayed by campaign infraction
hearings.
The results of the CSG elections
are currently withheld due to two
lawsuits filed with the University
Election Commission by the Make
Michigan and FORUM parties.
According to the provisions
of the new UEC election code,
the results of CSG elections will
be withheld until all cases are
resolved, according to Law stu-
dent Bryson Nitta, the Winter
2014 election director.
In compliance with the election
code, the UEC will issue demer-
its to those foundTesponsible for
the infraction. Each demerit will
result in a 3-percent deduction of
total weighted votes per demerits

issued.
On Monday, Make Michigan
filed a formal complaint against
FORUM, particularly concern-
ing legislative candidate Robert
Greenfield, an Engineering junior;
legislative candidate Jacob Podell,
an LSA freshman; and vice presi-
dential candidate Pavitra Abra-
ham, an LSA junior.
The first complaint alleged that
Greenfield falsely claimed to be
associated with the Campus Saf-
eRide app in tweets and Facebook
posts promoting FORUM. The
second complaint stated that the
FORUM party improperly implied
the endorsement of the SafeRide
app-
"Our own Engineering can-
didate Rob Greenfield worked
intricately on the application by
workingwithstudents,theadmin-
istration and top safety officials
to help make this app a reality," a
FORUM party supporter wrote on
Facebook on March 22.
In a March 21 interview with
the Daily, FORUM presidential
candidate Carly Manes, a Public
Policy junior, said FORUM was
responsible for the SafeRide app.
"The prototype is up, helped to
be completed by one of our repre-
sentatives, Robbie Greenfield," she

The killings began on April 6,
1994 following the assassination

of Rwandan President Juvenal
Habyarimana, an ethnic Hutu.
The conflict that lasted 100 days
was initiated by militant Hutus

By KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily Staff Reporter
LSA juniors Natasha Dab-
rowski and Corey Walsh were
elected president and vice
president, respectively, of LSA
Student Government for the
2014-2015 academic year. With
a roughly 15-percent turnout,
2,498 LSA students voted in the
March 26-27 election.
The election was the first
contested LSA-SG executive
race in five years, making can-
didates take a much more active
role in external campaigning.
Dabrowski said she and
Walsh are ecstatic to get started
intheirnewroles.
"We're now honored to be
able to serve the organization
that gave us so much since
freshman year in this new role
and empower new leaders and
new progress," she said.
Walsh said he is ready to
begin working on initiatives.
"We're most excited to real-
ly start to get to work on a lot
of the projects that we set out
to accomplish over the next
year in terms of student life,
academics and beyond," Walsh
said.

Dabrowski said external
campaigning helped raise stu-
dent interest in LSA-SG. She
added that overall campus
involvement in current CSG
elections contributed to the
increased attention to all of stu-
dent government.
"The campus is really gath-
ering around these elections,"
she said. "There are lots of dif-
ferent parties and lots of people
running."
LSA junior Kendall Johnson,
current LSA-SG vice president
and presidential candidate, said
it was important that students
had a diversity of choices while
voting.
Election Director Melissa
Burns said the campaigning
was free of infractions.
LSA senior Sagar Lathia, cur-
rent LSA-SG president, said the
friendly working atmosphere
in LSA-SG did not suffer due
to the increased campaign-
ing. He said the absence of
parties helped keep elections
from interfering with the
group's work.
"Because of the culture of
our organization, I'm proud
to say both groups have been
very cordial with each other,"
he said.
While he has enjoyed his
time leading LSA-SG, Lathia
said all four candidates have
and will continue tobe assets
to student government in the
transition of power.

pioneers new
mentorship
program
CHAMPIONS:
DETROIT tutors will
lead by example
By SARAH BERNARD
For the Daily
A teacher is more than an educa-
tor. A teacher is a reliable role model,
a motivating coach, a trusted friend,
and most importantly, a student's
number one fan. This is the idea that
initially kick-started CHAMPIONS:
DETROIT, anup-and-comingorgani-
zation ofstudent mentors on campus.
Beginning next fall, student men-
tors will serve as examples of the
opportunities that post-secondary
education creates for high school
students in Detroit. The organiza-
tion is looking for individuals who
are prepared to go above and beyond
- who understand that they are both
teaching and setting an example for
students. In short, they are looking
to provide students in Detroit with
"champions."
"This is more than just another
mentor, or another adviser, estab-
lishing a more compassionate type
of mentorship that is relationship-
based," said LSA sophomore Nathan
Sell, a board member of CHAMPI-
ONS.
LSA junior Michael Chrzan, the
organization's executive director,said
he began laying the groundwork for
this mentorship program after watch-
ing a documentary titled "Waiting for
Superman." In the film, social activist

Newpilot program
proposed for
alternative payment
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily StaffReporter
Imagine attending the Uni-
versity for four years without
ever seeing a tuition bill appear
on Wolverine Access. If a new
bill under consideration in the
state legislature succeeds, free
tuition could eventually become

a reality.
The Supporting Michigan and
Retaining Talent Act would fund
eligible students' public higher
education with the agreement
that they would then repay a
fixed percentage of their income
for a set number of years follow-
ing graduation.
SMART would introduce a
"pay it forward" model of tuition
in the state. In this system, a stu-
dent's tuition is funded by the
fixed payments of previous pro-
gram participants. Michigan's
proposal would require gradu-

ates to pay a percentage of their
income - 4 percent for four-year
college graduates and 2 percent
for community college gradu-
ates - for five times the number
of years they attended college.
For example, if a student were
to attend the University for four
years, he or she would make pay-
ments for 20 years.

born Heights), who co-sponsored

Representatives along with Rep.

said. "He's a part of the creation of
that - there were no Make Michigan
people actually a part of the creation
of this new SafeRide app."
Previously, Public Policy junior
Bobby Dishell, Make Michigan's
presidential candidate and current
CSG vice president, and Campus Saf-
eRide LLC concluded a formal agree-
ment wherein Campus SafeRide LLC
agreed to officially endorse Make
Michigan and gave Make Michigan
exclusive rights to promote the appli-
cation.
FORUM filed a countercomplaint
against Make Michigan claiming the
complaint was frivolous.
"Long before Mr. Greenfield
became an official candidate with the
FORUM party, he was hard at work on
a project to address student's trans-
portation needs," the respondent's
reply brief read.
The brief included multiple e-mails
between Greenfield and University
Provost Martha Pollack about the
development of the SafeRide app,
However, the petitioners of Make
Michigan responded in another brief
with a letter from Engineering senior
Summit Shrestha, one of the technical
developers for Campus SafeRide LLC.
"No member of the FORUM politi-
cal party has participated in the tech-
nical development of the SafeRide
application at any stage of this pro-
cess," Shrestha wrote in a March 25
letter to the UEC. "Mr. Greenfield
claims to have participated in this

development process, but his asser-
tion is simply untrue."
The UEC held a hearing Wednes-
day night and will come to a conclu-
sion Friday morning.
If FORUM is found responsible, the
UEC will issue the party a statutory
maximum of eight demerits, which
would result in a 24-percent reduc-
tion of FORUM's votes, Nitta said.
The second case preventing the
release of election results pertains to
an alleged violation of irresponsible
e-mail use by the Defend Affirmative
Action Party.
Steven Richards, a Social Work and
Public Health graduate student and
FORUM legislative candidate for the
School of Social Work, is suing DAAP
for improperly sending an e-mail to a
listserv of 630 Social Work students
on March 24, encouraging them to
vote for DAAP.
According to the complaint brief,
Social Work student Cassandra Muro
sent the e-mail on behalf of Social
Work student Reyna Asadizoudegani,
the DAAP legislative candidate for the
School of Social Work.
However, the respondent's brief
read: "Ms. Muro, unlike her friend,
did not become involved with DAAP
and has never volunteered with
DAAP. Ms. Asadizoudegani has never
asked Ms. Muro for assistance with
her campaign."
If the UEC finds the DAAP respon-
sible for requesting the e-mail, three
to four demerits will be issued per
e-mail recipient, Nitta said.
The hearing will begin at 4:30 p.m.
on Friday and the decision will be
announced 36 hours after the hear-
ing concludes.

RWANDA

from the country since 1959 began to
return to the nation.
The genocide ended in 1994 with
the victory of the Tutsi Rwandan
Patriotic Front, leaving between
500,000 and 1 million Rwandan
people dead.
During the war, Rusesabagina
offered refuge to 1,268 people,
both Hutu and Tutsi, in the Mille
Collines, the large hotel where he
had previously served as manager.
As a result of paying off generals
and wielding his connections, all
of the hotel guests survived the
genocide.
Rusesabagina's story was later
depicted in an Academy Award-
nominated film starring Don
Cheadle. The film was shown
Monday as part of the University's
commemoration activities.
In his remarks, Rusesabagi-
na said many of the problems in
Rwanda have been caused by poli-
ticians and government-sponsored
media and not the country's aver-
age citizens.
Rusesabagina also said other
countries require collective action
to intervene in international con-
flicts, as well as time to make deci-
sions and then take actions. He
also claimed the United Nations is
ruled by six or seven powers that
intervene in other countries only
to protect their own interests.
Rusesabagina, who was also a
2005 recipient of the Presidential

Medal of Freedom, has previous
history with the University. In
2005, he was awarded the Univer-
sity's Wallenberg Medal, an honor
that recognizes individuals who
have made significant contribu-
tions toward furthering human
rights.
Allan Stam, professor of Pub-
lic Policy and Political Science
and director of the International
Policy Center, said he, along with
Political Science Prof. Christian
Davenport, first thought about
organizing a commemoration of
the genocide six months ago.
Stam said Rusesabagina's own
observations during the event as
well as 20 years of study would
provide a perspective that people
in the United States don't often
hear.
"That there is hope for progress
in the future but that there is still
a lot of people who need to be held
accountable for what took place in
the past," Stam said.
Rusesabagina, who now lives
in Belgium and has not been to
Rwanda since 2004, said he does
feel nostalgic about his home. He
also established the Hotel Rwanda
Rusesabagina Foundation, which
works to prevent future genocides
and promote the healing process in
Rwanda.
"My dream is that one day we see
Hutus and Tutsis sitting around
that table," he said. "We'll see all of
these people talking. Bringing the
whole truth to the table. Practicing
equal justice towards sustainable
peace, not only for us but also for
our neighbors."

said this interest-free tuition plan
would eliminate financial barriers
to higher education. The bill was
introduced in February.
"Interest is taken off the table,"
Knezek said. "By doing the pro-
gram interest-free, we're saving
students tens of thousands of dol-
lars - literally with the swipe of a
pen."
The current legislation includes
only the implementation of a pilot
program. Funded with an initial $2
million grant, the pilot would con-

dents and 100 four-year university
students. Knezek said lawmakers
would monitor the program's suc-
cess over a five-year period with
the possibility of then considering
system-wide legislation.
Knezek said one of the propos-
al's best features is its ability to be
self-sustaining in the long run.
"When you pay back into the
program, this isn't going to banks,
this isn't going to line anybody's
pockets, nobody is making a profit
off you having attended an institu-

later elected chair of that subcom-
mittee and previously served on
the Curriculum Committee for the
College.
Dabrowski and Walsh will focus
on specific goals regarding aca-
demic projects and new student life
initiatives. A key point of their plat-
form is to make course evaluation
data public for studentstouse while
choosing courses.
"We hope to empower students
to take ownership of their educa-
program to fund the next genera-
tion of students."
Knezek said the legislation
was introduced through identical
House and Senate Bills, the latter
of which is sponsored by Sen. Jim
Ananich (D-Flint). The House bill
is currently being reviewed in the
Committee on Competitiveness
chaired by Rep. Mike Shirkey (R-
Jackson).
However, unlike in other states,
support for SMART is not unani-
mous in Michigan.
Audrey Spalding, director of
education policy at the Mackinac
Center of Public Policy, said tuition
model plans are simply not sustain-
able in the longterm.
"Is an engineering major who
might be facing the prospect of
earning $100,000 after graduation
really going to sign on to a program
where he's promising a percent-
age of his income? Probably not,"
Spalding said. "Is someone who's
considering majoring in a less
lucrative major more likely to sign
on to this program? Absolutely."
Spalding said without those
high-earning graduates, the fund
would not be substantial enough to
continually finance rising tuition
costs.
Spalding said she is also con-
cerned by the fact that "pay it

forward" plans ignore the root
problem - the exorbitant price tag
of higher education. She said leg-
islative initiatives such as SMART
would actually incentivize univer-
sities to raise tuition, given that
students would pay a fixed percent-
age of their own salary regardless
of the institution's price.
"It completely eliminates the
connection between what you pay
for your degree and what degree
youget," she said.
Last summer, the University's
Board of Regents approved the
smallest annual tuition increase
in 29 years. Still, the change is part
of a broader trend of upwardly spi-
raling tuition. LSA in-state tuition
increased by 60 percent between
academic years 2004-05 and 2013-
14.
Despite the opposition, Kne-
zek said part of his confidence in
SMART lies in the fact that every-
one can agree that some kind of
reformis necessary. When itcomes
to student loans, barriers to access
and the cost of higher education,
he said he remains committed to
improving higher education in the
state.
"Everybody acknowledges
the fact that we have a crisis
right now as it relates to college
tuition."

Staving behind the times
Michigan's government should support same-sex marriage decision
n Friday, U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman issued
a ruling that lifted Michigan's 2004 ban on same-sex
marriage. In less than 24 hours, the Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals granted atemporary stay on the judgment, which on Tuesday
was extended indefinitely by the appeals court. Filed by Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette (R), the stay means the government
does not recognize the marriages of hundreds of couples who rushed
to get married. Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's ambivalence on the
issue is not only discouraging, but also flies in the face of a majority
of Michiganders, who are now in favor of same-sex marriage. By
denying LGBTQ citizens equal protection under the law, the ban is
in direct violation of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution, and requires immediate attention and action from the
judiciary. The state government should support legal marriage for
LGBTQ couples. The court should also revoke the stay on Friedman's
ruling. Schuette's argument that Michigan voters approved the
existingban in 2004 completely ignores the public's current opinion,
as well as the fact that this decision is coming a decade later.

At 20 years old, I've been work-

inconspicuous room on the fourth
floor of the Dirksen Senate Office
Building, as well as the television
crew that accompanied them. Just
as I had made my way past them, a
door opened behind me.
"Mr. Gates, will you stop for a
photo please?"
"Mr. Gates, why are you here
today? What is the Gates Founda-
tion currently working on?"
Bill and his entourage ignored

both his admirers and the televi-
sion cameras, and came hurtling in
the direction I was already headed.
Bill freaking Gates was trailing me.
Or we happened to be walking in
the same direction. Whatever. I just
kept walking forward in shock and
as the crowd began to dissipate, Bill
and I found ourselves alone (with
six of his security guards) in the
hallway. So I did what every self-
respecting American would do - I
frantically rummaged through my
bag in hopes of locating my phone
and attempting an inconspicuous
Bill Gates selfie. And in the process
I dropped my metro card (an item
even more beloved than a Skeeps
card in Metropolitan D.C.). Luckily,
one of Bill's security men stopped
to pick it up.
This was my moment, my in. Fight
or flight. Do or die - and so I did.
"Excuse me, I know you said you
didn't want to take any pictures but
will you take one with me?" I asked.
Without missing a beat one of
his security men turned me down,
saying, "Sorry miss but we're busy."
To which Bill shook his head with
a faint laugh and responded, "No
we're not."
With that, he walked over next
to me, posed and smiled as the
man who retrieved my metro pass
excitedly snapped several photos.
I thanked him, told him I admired
his wife and the Gates Foundation
and floated away as they boarded
the elevator.
I do like that photo of me and
Bill, though despite its obvious
popularity amongst social media
- it makes me cringe a little. I
should've washed my hair. I should
have ironed my pants and I should
not have worn a shirt that revealed
the straps of my camisole. It was a
below-average outfit and a pedes-
trian moment. I know that may
sound superficial or trivial, or both,
but I could have looked more put

together. I could've at least intro-
duced myself or shaken his hand.
Only three months into my
semester sabbatical spent in the
"real world," that afternoon caught
me in full-blown banality. I belong
to a generation of Millennials that
are allegedly the "most affirmed"
generation to date, repeatedly told
that we can do whatever we sent our
minds to, and assured that we have
the necessary talents and skills to
become exceptional. But sometimes
we don't. We have the talents and
skill sets to be acceptable. We do
just enough to get by, we look in the
mirror and think a greasy, low bun is
"good enough," and consider the B-
we scraped by with just fine.
According to studies cited by the
New York Times, our generation
lacks the attitudes and behaviors
needed for job success. We don't
have a strong work ethic, we aren't
motivated and we don't take initia-
tive. Our employment expectations
are too high, and our commitment
levels too low. Maybe they're on to
something. I often hear my friends
claiming not that they would like a
job - but a job in Industry X, with
company Y, at level Z. Yet the rate
of 16 to 24-year-olds that are out of
school yet out of work is unusually
high at 15 percent, and many col-
lege graduates take jobs that do not
require a degree.
I think we can change these
perceptions. I think we can get up,
wash our hair and approach each
workday as if we may spontaneous-
ly bump into the wealthiest man in
America - not approach eachwork-
day as if we've already achieved it.
Mediocrity is tempting, and having
endured a short stay in the Ameri-
can work force, allow me to warn
you that your pants will wrinkle far
sooner than you hoped.

There is a clear mandate for the courts to
strike down the ban on same-sex marriage.
Since the passage of the 2004 ban, the public
support for same-sex marriage has shifted.
National support for same-sex marriage is the
highest in history, and this cultural acceptance
has been manifested in film, art, television and
other forms of popular culture. Furthermore,
54 percent of Michiganders support same-
sex marriage. The courts have historically
followed the trend of public opinion in their
interpretation 'of how the Constitution,
written more than 200 years ago, is to be
applied to present-day society and should
continue to work within this-framework to
extend protection to more citizens.
After the ban was lifted last Friday, more
than 300 couples across Michigan were legally
married. The fact that these couples have now
been placed in legal limbo is the latest unjust
decision in a long debate over an outdated
constitutional amendment. Snyder affirmed
that the marriages were legal at the time they
occurred but that the state will not recognize
them. Not affording legal recognition to these

unions cheats the couples out of full legal
benefits - the very reason April DeBoer and
Jayne Rowse brought their case to court.
Instead of intervening in DeBoer and Rowse's
case by filing a holding, Schuette should
recognize these couples in order to ensure that
they have the same protections and benefits as
other married citizens.
The behavior of our elected officials is
neither appropriate nor representative of
the collective will of Michigan's citizens.
Both Schuette and Snyder need to respect
the majority opinion before advancing their
own agendas. Snyder's unwillingness to
reconsider his stance on same-sex marriage
or call for alegislative steptoward to marriage
equality is disheartening to the many couples
married this weekend and unfair to the
people whom he serves. Snyder has claimed
that he only has the power to enforce the law,
but continually backs legislation that makes
its way through Michigan's legislature. His
hypocritical behavior and lack of leadership
on this controversial issue during an election
year is cowardly.

Respecting mental health

f all people, I never thought I'd find
myselfempathizing with ChrisBrown.
In fact, given his Rihanna-beating
and general cockiness, I
essentially abhorred him.
But now, as I've read more
and more about his recent
stints in rehab and in jail, I '
find myself relating to him
- onsome odd level - more
and more.
Chris Brown is 24 years
old, and suffers from bipo- CAITLYN
lar disorder. Like him, Iam BRENNAN
a young person faced with
the challenges of the same
mental illness.
Bipolar disorder is characterized by periods
of depression and mania. The depression side
is easy enough to relate to - most people go
through at least one depressive period in their
life. The mania side is more difficult, though.
I can't completely accurately describe
what mania is like. To lose your sanity, slowly
and then so quickly, is impossible to put into
words. Like water slipping through cupped
hands, no matter how hard you squeeze your
fingers together, your sanity just drips through
to its escape, leaving you with nothing. The
sheer terror and agony of watching yourself
melt away and feeling unable to stop it, as you
transform into something you don't recognize
- the deep levels of insecurity and uncertain-
ty you are brought to - it's all so much for one
person to handle.
And while experiencing the mania is one
thing, managing it is another. From falling into
dangerous drinking habits, chasing bottles of
Xanax with bottles of wine in an attempt to
keep your mind calm, to getting yourself regu-
lated on antipsychotics, often with serious side
effects, it's easy to find yourself in a place you
really don't want to be. The frustration and
anxiety brought on by treating the mania can
beget worse mania.
It's for these reasons I find myself empa-
thizing with Chris Brown. While we, the
public, don't know the intricacies of his incar-
ceration, I feel like I know fairly well the intri-
cacies of his illness. The way that the media
handles his behaviors is that of a circus act,
not that of someone sufferingaserious illness.
Radio DJs talk about him going into solitary

confinement - "He can't shower except every
two days! Ew!" - but not about the ramifica-
tions that might have on someone already
mentally unstable.
Chris Brown has obviously done some ter-
rible things to merit the punishments he has
received, and arguably has gotten off with
less punishment than the average person
might. Still, I think there is a moral obligation
to at least try to understand and acknowl-
edge the mental illness from which he
purportedly suffers.
The same goes for someone like Amanda
Bynes, who though clearly suffered (is suffer-
ing?) a mental health crisis, was turned into the
laughingstock of the public. Would someone
with an illness like cancer be treated the same
way? Would someone with a mental disabil-
ity be laughed at like she was? This is a person
clearly suffering very serious mental health
issues, but look at the way she was treated.
As I experience my own extreme ups and
downs trying to find a course of treatment that
works for me, I find myself constantly on the
verge of"crazy."As I switch medications, trying
to find one that doesn't turn me into a zombie
butkeeps the mania at bay, there are days Istart
to feel my sanity slip through my fingers again.
And it scares me, because at times, I am only
days away from the possibility of being Chris
Brown or Amanda Bynes. Would I be laughed
at? Would I be ostracized? Would everyone so
quickly forget my competencies and achieve-
ments as a "normal" person, in favor of reveling
in my loss of reality?
I'm fortunate to have an amazing system of
supportive family, friends, instructors and cli-
nicians. I'm fortunate to have been raised to
not shy away from issues of mental health, but
to work to overcome them. Most fortunately,
I think, I suffer mainly in privacy, not in the
public eye. While I can imagine what celebri-
ties with bipolar disorder go through, I cannot
imagine what it is like to go through it publicly.
It's easy to get caught up in the whims of gos-
sip magazines and TMZ, but I ask regardless -
for my sake and the sake of others - that when
it comes to issues of mental health, we afford
people a bit more compassion as they endure
their challenges.

These questions drive young
adult literature into what it is
today: a thriving industry on the
rise. A genre in which an honest
exploration of what it means to
be anything at all is valued above
unnecessary complexity. Through
this examination, unique plot,
unforgettable characters and
captivating prose pours out the
faucet into the cool, not-so-calm
YA waters where the deep end isn't

There's no shame in
your TV preferences

By DREW MARON
DailyArts Writer
A couple of weeks ago I wrote an
article about the shows I was most
excited to seethis year. One of those
shows was "Believe," a science-
fiction drama created by Oscar
winning director, Alfonso Cuar6n
("Gravity") and produced by J.J.
Abrams ("Star Wars Episode VII").
It seemed like a magic combination.
Then I started readingreviews.
Words like "cliched" and
"cheesy" were thrown around
by numerous critics and Rotten
Tomato's Tomatometer dropped
to 36 percent approval. I was disap-

I kept thinking, "How could this
have happened? How could such
talented people fail so miserably?"

show, I downloaded the first two
episodes and braced myself for the
worst. But something happened
that I didn't anticipate: I actually

partners Music Theatre and Dance
senior Ellie Sachs, who directed the
play, and LSA senior Jacob Axelrad,
a former Michigan Daily arts con-
tributor, who wrote it.
"DoingWhite Nights"is first and
foremost a story of the friendship
between two best friends, Mike
and Aaron, both UM seniors tak-
ingacross-countryroadtrip. How-
ever, trouble strikes whentheir car
breaks down in a deserted Ohio
cornfield outside of civilization. To
make matters worse, Mike, who
has recently been released from
a mental hospital , has run out of
his medication. The pair must sur-
vive the battle against cold, hunger
and Mike's inner-demons as their
friendship takes the ultimate test.

Axelrad and Sachs started con-
ceptualizing the play last summer.
The script was finished by January
and the casting complete by early
February.
"This is probably (the play)
based most on my own experi-
ences because I've never written
about people who are directly my
age or anything so personal," Axel-
rad said. "Seeing everyone come
together with different skills and
expertise to make this vision that
was originally an idea I had on
paper is pretty awesome."
Many of the students working
on the show have previously col-
laborated with Sachs and Axelrad.
Because of limited funding by the
University, the play has been sig-
nificantly funded by a Kickstarter
project.
"JacobandIwerereallycommit-
ted to doing the show on our own
and doing it within the city of Ann
Arbor, much like we would be if we
were trying to do our own work in
New York, Chicago or LA," Sachs
said. "You've got to do it yourself,
you've got to find the venue, you've
got to findthe people and you've got
to make it work."
"It's been a challenge but so
rewarding when the pieces come
together, and you've got be a go-
getter," Sachs added. "You've got to
go out and get it done, and I think
it's good practice for what the
future mightlook like for us."
As a venue, The Yellow Barn
adds a perfect ambiance to the set-
tingof the story. The barn's raw and
rustic, yet cozy interior allows for
significant creative liberty from the
show's art director, Music, Theatre
and Dance and LSA senior Mada-
lyn Hochendoner, while also letting
the audience use their imagina-
tions.
"This is a wonderful space to
have, and you've got to be self-moti-
vated. As much as Ellen is a good
motivator, there's only so many
times she can tell you to do some-
thing," Hochendoner said. "You've
got to be willing to collaborate and
go out on your own and be the one
to do the research bring the stuff

and get excited about it."
Hochendoner previously
worked with Sachs in various class-
es during their time at the Univer-
sity. Being from Ohio, the cornfield
setting appealed to her and drew
her to the project. Hochendoner
has also dealt with mental illness
personally through family mem-
bers with bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia, and took that expe-
rience into the shaping of her work.
The decorative cornstalks that are
present on the set throughout the
play differ aesthetically based on
Mike's state of mind, and Hochen-
doner incorporated pill bottles and
other trinkets where she thought
tasteful.
The play's small cast and crew
has allowed the group to.become
close knit and supportive of
each other's artistic talents. An
actress in the production, LSA
freshman Anna Garcia, was dis-
covered by Sachs after an improvi-
sational comedy show in February.
Although she's done theater for
most of her life, this is her first the-
atrical production at the Univer-
sity.
"Ellie is so talented when it
comes to directing, she has such
a clear vision," Garcia said. "The
show is going to be great and a lot
of that is due to her."
Garcia is playing the role of Ali-
cia, the deceased sister of the char-
acter Mike who appears during the
character's hallucinations. Alicia's
entrances bridge moments of real-
ity and reconstructed memory
with tap-dancing interludes from
the 1980s film "White Nights", the
play's namesake. The various artis-
tic mediums and subtleties with
which the play takes the audience
between the inner landscape of
Mike's mind and the realities of the
cornfield, showcase the distinct
creative talentsbehind the play.
"Just being a part of (Doing
White Nights), I feel cool just to be
involved," Garcia said. "I'm sur-
rounded by all these people with
these great visions who just exude
talent. I'm just proud to be here for
the ride."

Are you in need of a good laugh?
Yes, yes you are. Because between
the soul-crushing despair of this
never-ending winter and the sick-
ening realization that participation
is 20 percent of your grade in that
classyou've never said aword in,the
world can often seem likea humor-
less place.
So allow me then to introduce
you to misters Groucho, Chico,
Harpo and Zeppo, better known
to the world as the Marx Brothers.
The kings of comedy during the
1920s and '30s, the Marx Broth-
ers' special brand of anarchic and
improvisational humor catapulted
them to stardom and ensured
comedic relevance for generations
to come.
Now some people will imme-
diately assume black-and-white
films aren't funny. Luckily for the
rest of us, those same people aren't
inclined to pick up a newspaper. So
let's begin.
Sons of Jewish immigrants,
the brothers grew up in a relatively
poor section of New York City's
Upper East Side. Coming from an
artistic family, the brothers were
encouraged to develop their musi-
cal skills and eventually began per-
forming vaudeville. Success there
led to shows on Broadway and
eventually major motion picture
deals. It was in the early vaudeville
performances that they created and
perfected their individual stage per-
sonas. ~
Groucho, instantly recogniz-
able by his trademark greasepaint
mustache and eyebrows as well as
his glasses and cigar, always played
the fast-talking, wisecracking man
in charge. With his biting one-
liners and off-the-cuff innuendos,
Groucho exudes the most modern
of comedic sensibilities of the broth-
ers. Take his line in "Duck Soup"
about Margaret Dumont's charac-
ter: "Remember men, we're fight-
ing for this woman's honor; which
is probably more than she ever did."

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
Michigan coach Erik Bakich, in his second year, has made this year's goal for his
team simple: to win a Big Ten regular-season championship. The achievement
would be its first since 2008.
On baseball: A
new beginning

By BEN FIDELMAN
Daily Sports Writer
After playing 24 games in five
different states, the Michigan
baseball team made its home
debut this week. The team got
off to a frustrating 2-8-1 start to
the season, but it has rebounded
of late and is trending upward
moving into Big Ten play. The
Daily broke down the team
position by position.

Led by junior center fieldet
Jackson Glines, the Wolverines
outfield has provided a solid
footing for the lineup on both
sides of the ball. Offensively, the

average and make up just under

Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan baseball team
is near the bottom of the league
in every statistical hitting
category. Its 175 strikeouts are
34 more than the next Big Ten
team. The woeful hitting is,
perhaps, the principal reason
for the team's underwhelming
10-14-1record.
Now, as the Wolverines enter
the heart of Big Ten play, the
excuses - dominant opposing
pitching, freshman mistakes
and, yes, even bad luck - are
starting to fall on deaf ears.

Michigan has shown glimps-
es of being a Big Ten title team.
At times, it looks like a last-
place finisher. But after a 4-3
win against Indiana on Sunday,
arguably the conference's top
team, there's reason to believe
this team is underachieving.
Before the season, Michigan
was faced with a number of
questions.

Indiana heads
in as conference
favorite
By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan baseball team
has shown in the past that it is
capable of being a legitimate
contender in the Big Ten. The
Wolverines boast 35 conference
titles but the program has been
in a six-year drought.
The last time Michigan (1-2
Big Ten, 10-14-1 overall) won the
regular-season title or the post-
season conference tournament
was in 2008 under coach Rich
Maloney, but Maloneyisnow out
of the picture and Erik Bakich
has stepped into the frame.
After the Wolverines posted
losing seasons in 2011 and 2012,
Bakich brought Michigan back
above .500 in his first season.
He'll try to keep Michigan on
the road to becoming Big Ten
Champions once again but will
meet roadblocks alongthe way.
Indiana (2-1,12-10)
The Hoosiers are the
reigning Big Ten conference
and tournament champions,
earning an automatic bid into
last year's NCAA Baseball
Championship where they
made it to the College World
Series - the first Big Ten team
since 1983.
They remain one of this
year's toughest conference
teams and were unanimously
chosen by Big Ten coaches to
win the conference for a second
straight year. After going 2-1
against the Wolverines last
weekend, Indiana is tied for
first in the standings with Ohio
State, Minnesota and Iowa.
Players to watch: third
baseman Dustin DeMuth and
catcher Kyle Schwarber.
DeMuth currently leads the
Indiana roster with a .343 bat-
ting average, good for 10th in
the conference. Meanwhile,
Schwarber was named the top
MLB draft prospect by Baseball
America. The junior led the con-
ference with a.647slugging per-
centage and had the third-best
batting average at .366 last year.
Ohio State (2-1,16-7)
The Buckeyes are in a slump
- they finished 2013 with
their worst hitting since 1971,
combining for a .258 batting
average. In Ohio State's final
15 games last season, the team
scored more than three runs
only once and let a share of the
conference title slip away with
two straight losses in the final
regular-season series against
the Hoosiers.
Third-year head coach Greg
Beals will try to get his team
back into the NCAA Tourna-

ment after a four-year drought.
Players to watch: right-
handed pitcher/first baseman
Josh Dezse.
Out of high school, Dezse
turned down a chance to
play professional ball as a
28th-round pick by the New
York Yankees so he could play
in college. He earned Big Ten
Freshman of the Year due to his
performance on the field and
the mound, where his fastball
broke 100 miles per hour on the
radar gun.
Nebraska (1-2,14-10)
In the program's third year
in the Big Ten, the Cornhuskers
were picked to finish second
after dropping last year's
conference tournament
championship game to Indiana.
Nebraska is ranked second in
Big Ten fielding percentage at
.975, but went 1-2 in its opening
Big Ten weekend against Iowa.
But don't let the Cornhuskers'
current fifth-place standing
fool you.
Nebraska is returning some
injured players this year, both
in the bullpen and at the plate.
Last season, left-hander Kyle
Kubatstarted eight games, with
opponents hitting .208, but he
missed 33games dueto shoulder
soreness. With him back in the
rotation, the Cornhuskers have
a deeper bullpen to fall back on.
Players to watch: First
basemanAustin Christensen and
outfielder Ryan Boldt.
Christensen is a redshirt
sophomore who missed 2012
due to an elbow injury and
spent 2013 recovering from
Tommy John Surgery, but
his senior year in high school
showed potential that may
surface this year. He led the
entire state of Iowa in batting
average (.555) and home
runs(19) and was the 2011
Gatorade Player of the Year.
Boldt injured his knee in
April, but is still shaping up to
be a possible first-round pick in
the MLB draft and is currently
hitting.342,12th in the Big Ten.
Illinois (12-10)
Last season, the Fighting
Illini earned an at-large bid
for the NCAA Tournament but
were eliminated in Regionals.
In the conference coach's
preseason poll, they were voted
to end this season in a fifth-
place tie with Michigan.
Illinois has won its last
three games and will play its
first conference game against
Purdue on Friday. The Illini
have the second-best ERA in
the Big Ten at 3.23 and come
in at fourth with a .267 batting
average.
Player to watch: catcher Jason
Goldstein.
Goldstein has posted a .373
batting average, good for fourth
inthe BigTen.

Daily Sports Writer

ndiana pitcher Christian
Morris stepped up to the
mound and gazed at his
opponent strolling to the plate.
The 6-foot, 190-pound figure
60 feet away was as cool as the
March Midwestern air around
them.
Travis Maezes swung his bat
around himlike a toy, hisstill face
treating every movement with
the same precision and care as the

Maezes digs into the left-handed
batter's box. For the sophomore,
the confidence has always come
easily. No matter what sport he
tried growingup, he couldn't lose.
Today, that sport is baseball,
and as Michigan's man, it was on
his shoulders to prevent Michigan
from losing a third straight game
and falling to 0-3 in the Big Ten.
The 0-1 pitch by Morris came
in low and away. But Maezes
made solid contact and shot the
ball into the Hoosiers' bright
new turf at Bart Kaufman Field.
As the ball bounced high into
the air, Maezes took off. The
former hockey
player glided
down the line,

the sophomore
helped pave
the way for other Wolverines.
After mustering just five hits the
previous game, Michigan posted
three in the first inning, allowing
Maezes to score the opening run.

Like with many leaders, the
progressofthe Michiganbaseball
team mirrors the progress of
Maezes.
Using the momentum of a
freshman year full of potential,

As the years went on, it looked
like Maezes' commitment to

hockey would pay off. Playing
for elite Triple-A youth hockey
team Compuware and for Ann

Maezes began drawing attention
from colleges for his play on the

But in the fall of his sophomore
year, an ankle injury wiped out

Maezes turned to a different

said. "I had to pick which route I

writers do their best to
predict what will happen in
the world of college
baseball this season.

MICHIGAN
From Page 6
rounded player on the
Michigan roster is sophomore
shortstop Travis Maezes, whose
average has been sitting in the
low .300s for much of the year but
has undergone a recent uptick.
The lefty showed power when he
pounded two home runs in the
same day against the College of
Charleston.
With a tremendously young
infield, senior catcher Cole Mar-
tin provides a breath of leadership
where it's most desperately need-
ed. Perhaps his greatest strength
this season has been durability.
Multiple times, Martin has held
his post behind the plate for three
or four games in a weekend - a
physical toughness that not all
catchers can offer. Though he is
putting up a miserable .176 batting
average, his worth is well-covered
by his defense and leadership.
Two other offensive forces
reside at first base in Jusick and
junior Kendall Patrick. The duo
usually fills the four and five holes
in the batting order, with one or
the other at designated hitter.
Patrick has two home runs on the
season - one of just three players

on the team to hit a single dinger
this year.
Starting Pitching
The starting rotation has given
a mixed bag of results so far this
season. Many expected more
stability from a rotation that
returned every arm that started a
game in the 2013 season, but that
dependability is hit or miss. The
group is led by fifth-year senior
right-hander Ben Ballantine, who
carries a 2.81 earned-run average
through six starts this season
and has tentatively been named
the team's ace. Ballantine's ERA
was among the best in the Big Ten
until his start Friday against the
Hoosiers, when he was roughed
up for three runs in 1.2 innings
pitched.
The combination of sophomore
left-hander Evan Hill and junior
left-hander Trent Szkutnik have
combined for a shaky tail-end to
the weekend rotation. Though
they only have one combined
win, their strikeout numbers are
among the best in the Big Ten.
Power pitching is one of the staff's
goals, and these pitchers perfectly
fill that role.
Bullpen
The story of the season so far
has been the young bullpen's
highs and lows. It's the area that

the team lives and dies with -
when playing in so many close
games, having reliable arms in the
late innings is key.
Junior right-hander Donnie
Eaton, senior right-hander Alex
Lakatos, freshman right-hander
Mac Lozer and freshman right-
hander Keith Lehmann are
pitchers who have emerged as
being most dependable.
Cronenworth acts as the closer
and is considered one of the best
in the country. Offseason labrum
surgery kept him off the mound
through the first few weeks of the
season, but he has rebounded well
enough to maintain an 0.96 ERA
while racking up a Big Ten-best
five saves.
The veterans and the newcom-
ers have a sense of optimism about
the team and its future. Bakich's
methods and style have meshed
well with the Wolverines, by all
accounts. Bakich is focused not
only on this teams success but on
the program's future.
"The players are buying into
the enthusiasm and the style that
we bring," Bakich concluded.
"Our program will have an
identity, we don'thave an identity
right now, but I think all great
organizations know exactly what
they stand for."

M' finishes season

Poor first half dooms
Wolverines in final game

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
BOWLING GREEN, Ohio
- It's safe to say the Michigan
women's basketball team will
want to beat Bowling Green next
year. Badly.
The Wolverines kicked off
their season with a loss to Bowl-
ing Green (17-1 MAC, 30-4 over-
all) in early November, and just
four-and-a-half months later, the
Falcons picked up where they left
off. Michigan's season ended just
like it started after the Wolver-
ines (8-8 Big Ten, 20-14) fell 63-53
in the third round of the WNIT.
In one of the loudest venues
Michigan has played in this
season, Bowling Green pushed
the Wolverines from both teams'
favorite spot - the 3-point arc.
The Falcons hit five of nine
from beyond the arc in the first
half and added four more in the
second, holding Michigan to
3-for-13 from three.
Sophomore guard Madison
Ristovski, who in recent weeks
has become the Wolverines'
most lethal long-range threat,
was unable to find a rhythm. And
freshman guard Siera Thompson,
who has hit athree in all 35 games
this season, went just 1-of-5.
"I think our team really grew
(between matchups with the
Falcons), really improved and
really found its identity," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "Bowling Green is a
tough matchup, and they're
extremely tough at home. They
had a great atmosphere here
tonight, but I think they had the
edge playing here."
Despite getting out of reach
late, the game looked promising
early for the Wolverines who,
after trailing for the first few
minutes of the game, got a jumper
from the right side of the key from
junior forward Nicole Elmblad to
put them up 12-10 five minutes
in. The basket not only marked
Michigan's new program record
for points in a season but also the

Wolverines' last lead of the game.
From there, Michigan went tight
when its baskets weren't falling.
"I think this time that we
played them we definitely started
off a lot stronger," Elmblad said.
"This time we were more focused
and ready to lock up on defense,
but unfortunately we didn't hold

"We got some good looks, but
we couldn't get shots to fall and
there were some calls we didn't
get to go our way," Barnes Arico
said. "I think that took the wind

half. It's not a new narrative,
but one that made the difference
for the fourth time this year.
Tonight, it gave Bowling Green

Wolverines out of the WNIT,
leaving them with an impressive
20-14 record in what was widely
identified before the season as a
transition year.

gr remaining, . Michigan was
deadlocked with the Falcons at
19. As junior forward Cyesha
Goree picked up a charge trying
to beat the buzzer on a half-
court prayer, the score stood
at 31-22 following a fast-paced,
back-and-forth first half that
escaped the Wolverines entirely
in the final five minutes.
"That took the wind out
of our sails a little bit," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "We could never get back

"It's definitely been a differ-

ward Nicole Elmblad.
This time around, the
Wolverines' final eight minutes
were troubled in every phase
of play. The foul on Goree
was her second, a completely
unnecessary pickup for a
player plagued by foul trouble
all season.
Michigan's shots weren't
falling, not even a wide-open,
point-blank Elmblad jumper
with two minutes left. Bowling
Green forward Jill Stein's layup
on the next possession brought
the raucous crowd to its feet.
Though the halftime deficit
stood at just nine points, it
became clear early in the second
half that the night belonged to
the home team. The only true
glimmer of hope came when
freshman guard Paige Rakers
cut the lead to single digits on
a corner 3-pointer just seconds
after checking into the game.
There's no telling what might
have been, had the Wolverines
closed out the first half on a
stronger note - while frenetic

Tonight's nearly identical
scoreline, though, belies the
tremendous growth that Barnes

season.
"I think our team really

Barnes Arico said. "This team

With 5:02 left in the half and the
game still within reach, Elmblad
hit a fadeaway that put Michigan
within one, but the Falcons
countered with a 9-1 run to end
the half, putting the Wolverines
down nine going into the locker
room. Bowling Green used strong
3-point shooting, going 5-for-9 in
the first 20 minutes, to pad its lead.
Unfortunately for Michigan,

Rakers hit a triple off the bench
followed by a layup from Elmblad.
But Michigan was unable to make
the necessary stops on the defen-
sive end and halt the momentum
inside Stroh Center.
By the end of the night the
Bowling Green crowd was
deafening and the Wolverines
couldn't generate a last-minute
spark - ending their season just
like it began.

The only flaws Hoke men-

were injury-related. Freshman
wide receiver Drake Harris has

Hoke expected him to be held

ris missed all of his senior sea-

enrolled at Michigan healthy.
"We're probably being a little
bit more safe with it," Hoke said.
Harris participated fully in
the Wolverines' early practices,
and Hoke thought he was pro-
gressing nicely, learning how to
properly run Michigan's routes.
Young running backs
improve: Because of a combina-
tion of poor offensive line play
and personal underachieve-
ment, Michigan's running backs
endured a frustrating 2013 sea-
son. The Wolverines' top return-
ing running backs, sophomores
Derrick Green and De'Veon
Smith, combined for just 387
rushing yards last season on 109
attempts for an average of 3.55
yards per carry.
Hoke says he has seen
improvement in the pair through
the beginning spring practices
compared to their contributions
in the fall, particularly for
Green.
"(Green's in better) shape,
in experience, understanding
the expectations, maybe a little
more of a clarity, I think it's all
part of it," Hoke said.
Hoke also noted that he has
seen immense improvement
from the pair in pass protection.
Offensive line transfer:
Hoke also responded to rumors
that Michigan is interested in
Alabama guard Chad Lindsay,
a graduate transfer, to shore
up the offensive line. Lindsay
played for offensive coordinator
Doug Nussmeier and would be
eligible to play for the Wolver-
ines in the fall because of gradu-
ate transfer rules. He spoke in
vague terms, but didn't rule out
the possibility.
"We'll investigate all those
guys, just to see where we're at,"
Hoke said.
