On Tuesday night, 10 
candidates running for the 
Democratic 
presidential 
nomination 
gathered 
in 
downtown 
Detroit’s 
Fox Theatre for a live 
debate organized by CNN. 
Approximately 
3,500 
students, 
government 
leaders, city residents and 
guests were in attendance.
Author 
Marianne 
Williamson, 
Rep. 
Tim 
Ryan, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, 
Mayor 
Pete 
Buttigieg, 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. 
Elizabeth Warren, Former 

Rep. 
Beto 
O’Rourke, 
Former 
Gov. 
John 
Hickenlooper, Former Rep. 
John Delaney and Gov. 
Steve Bullock all took the 
stage on the first of a two-
night debate series.
University of Michigan 
students were among those 
in attendance. LSA junior 
Clare Godfryd said she 
felt fortunate to attend the 
debate, as not all students 
were able to obtain tickets.
“Pretty much everyone 
who is able to attend is 
either very well off, a 
donor or has some sort 
of connection like us,” 
Godfryd said. “It made 
me wish that more people 
had the opportunity to see 

events like this in person, 
because 
it 
was 
really 
rewarding.”
The 
candidates 
discussed a wide variety 
of issues — highlighting 
differences in policy among 
their campaign platforms 
— with a specific focus on 
health care, immigration, 
electability 
and 
race. 
Other topics, like taxation, 
gun violence and climate 
change were also covered.
Medicare was the main 
focus of the first hour of 
the debate, with all 10 
candidates 
weighing 
in 
with their plans for health 
care reform.

DEMOCRATS DEBATE IN DETROIT

Warren, Sanders disagree with moderate candidates
over Medicare for All, plans for economy on first night

Thousands 
of 
eager 
attendees 
descended 
on 
Fox Theatre for the second 
round 
of 
Democratic 
presidential primary debates 
hosted by CNN in Detroit on 
Wednesday night. 
On stage for part two were 
former Vice President Joe 
Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris, 
Sen. Cory Booker, former 
Gov. Jay Inslee, Mayor Bill 
De Blasio, former Secretary 
of 
Housing 
and 
Urban 
Development Julián Castro, 
entrepreneur 
Andrew 

Yang, 
Congresswoman 
Tulsi Gabbard, Sen. Kirsten 
Gillibrand and Sen. Michael 
Bennet.
In Tuesday’s debate, the 
two top pollers, Warren 
and Sanders –– also widely 
considered 
the 
most 
progressive in the race –– 
were seen as presenting a 
united front, defending each 
other against the attacks of 
more moderate candidates. 
In 
Wednesday’s 
debate, 
Biden, who has led by 
double-digit percentages in 
a majority of polls, received 
the brunt of the attacks 
from other candidates, but 
close in tow was Harris, who 
received 
strong 
criticism 
from others on her criminal 

justice record.
De Blasio was the first 
to attack both, using his 
opening statement to depict 
them as part of the status 
quo.
“Joe Biden told wealthy 
donors 
that 
nothing 
fundamentally 
would 
change if he were president. 
 
Kamala Harris said she’s not 
trying to restructure society. 
Well, I am,” De Blasio said. 
“When I’m president, we 
will even up the score and 
we will tax the hell out of the 
wealthy to make this a fairer 
country and to make sure it’s 
a country that puts working 
people first.”

Biden, Harris spar on health care plans, history on 
criminal justice history during rowdy second night

‘Die-in’ calls for 
climate action

Event at UMMA 
intends to raise 
awareness of 
climate change

The bodies of about 50 students, 
faculty and Ann Arbor residents 
lay still on the floor of the Taubman 
Gallery at the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art for 11 minutes on July 
27 as part of a “die-in.” The event, 
hosted by the Ann Arbor Climate 
Mobilization and UMMA, intended 
to raise awareness of climate change 
by mimicking death and highlighting 
the role time plays in the issue.
The die-in brought attention to the 
UMMA exhibit “The World to Come: 
Art in the Age of the Anthropocene,” 
which displayed effects of human 
activity 
on 
the 
environment. 
According to Morgan Barrie, event 
organizer and Ann Arbor resident, 
this form of protest has been used 
for a wide range of issues, though the 
UK based group Extinction Rebellion 
inspired this particular event. 
“Die-in’s have been held recently 
for climate action, for gun safety, for 
a lot of things where people are trying 
to stress the urgency of an issue and 
what is at stake if no action is taken,” 
Barrie said. “...I do want to highlight 
that in the UK it’s often an act of civil 
disobedience whereas here UMMA’s 
been insanely cooperative about 
working with us. We approached 
them because of this show, which in 

and of itself is a call for action. There 
are many images showing the climate 
crisis, showing the environmental 
destruction, 
showing 
species 
extinction.”
During the 11 minutes, Barrie 
spoke every so often, explaining the 
reasoning behind the designated time 
frame and sharing information either 
about climate change or one of the 
pieces on display in the exhibit. 
“We picked this duration because 
based on the most recent UN 
intergovernmental panel on climate 
change report we have about 11 years 
to drastically reduce carbon emissions 
if we want to avert the worst climate 
catastrophes,” Barrie said. 
Meg Daupan, an alum of the 
School of Sustainability and the 
Environment, currently works in 
their DEI office and attended the 
die-in and the speeches following the 
protest on the steps of the UMMA. 
Daupan said she has been working on 
this issue and was invited to the event 
by one of her former professors.
“I currently lead a program on 
conservation for underrepresented 
groups of undergraduate students,” 
Daupan said. “ We recently watched 
the documentary ‘the Last Animals’... 
it’s really sad to learn how much 
damage humans have caused and so I 
thought I would come here today for 
the die-in and hear perspectives from 
different people.”
As she lay physically on the floor 
of the gallery, Daupan said she felt 
a stronger bond to the earth.

Changes result in 
mixed feelings from 
undocumented 
student community

Currently, a student must enroll 
at the University of Michigan 
within 28 months of graduating 
high school or obtaining a GED 
certificate to qualify for in-state 
tuition. Effective fall 2020, the time 
limit will be extended to 40 months 
for newly enrolling students, the 
University announced on July 18. 
The change was approved by 
the Board of Regents at their July 
meeting after review of “sufficient 
evidence” 
demonstrating 
differences in timing of application 
submission and enrollment across 
different 
demographics. 
The 
new policy aligns with those at 
Michigan State University and 
Oakland University, both of which 

also have a 40-month time limit. 
For 
community 
college 
attendees, 
underrepresented 
minorities, 
first-generation 
students and low-income students, 
the 
median 
time 
from 
high 
school graduation to university 
enrollment ranged from 28 to 
44 
months, 
explained 
Kedra 
Ishop, vice provost for enrollment 
management. 
“We need to make sure that we 
maintain reasonable access for 
those who need to stop along the 
way, for instance to work, but who 
continue to achieve and are great 
candidates for U-M,” Ishop said.
LSA junior Monica Olszewski, 
secretary 
of 
First-Generation 
College Students @ Michigan, 
expressed 
excitement 
for 
the 
extension. She said the change will 
help first-generation students who 
may need time after high school 
graduation to plan and arrange 
finances.

Americans packed down-
town Detroit on Tuesday and 
Wednesday nights to engage 
in activities regarding the 
Democratic 
presidential 
debates being held at the Fox 
Theater. Beyond the 3,500 
present in the audience, a pre-
dicted 10 million more people 
followed along through the 
TV broadcast. In Washtenaw 
County, residents gathered at 
watch parties to eat, view and 
debate amongst themselves.
Washtenaw for Warren 
hosted a watch party for the 
first debate in June, yet 15 
minutes before the debate 
aired on Tuesday, the atten-
dance at their watch party at 
the Cirq Bar had already sur-
passed that of the first par-
ty’s. Danny Steinmetz, Ann 
Arbor resident and Washt-
enaw for Warren co-chair, 
shared he believes watch 
parties encourage political 
engagement because they let 
activists know they aren’t 
alone. Steinmetz said people 
watch the debate “the way 

they watch a sporting event” 
— as a means of entertain-
ment.
“You have people desper-
ate for a breakout, so some 
of the drama will be them 
attempting to do god knows 
what stunts,” Steinmetz said. 
“I’m waiting for someone 
to stand on their head to get 
attention.”
Attendees 
expressed 
frustration 
toward 
these 
“stunts,” with Ann Arbor 
resident Leslie Sobel even 
reminiscing about “throwing 
things at the TV when it’s not 
Warren talking” during the 
last debates. Rackham stu-
dent Jason Grant reverber-
ated this common sentiment 
by explaining his choice for 
the Democratic nomination 
would “completely contrast 
what we’re dealing with right 
now, (actions) that look like 
governing instead of tweet-
ing.”
Sobel also commented on 
the large field of Democrat-
ic presidential candidates, 
which she finds “ridiculous.” 
She believes some of the can-
didates should drop out of 
the race and run for Senate 
instead, because a Democrat-

ic president “isn’t going to get 
enough done unless we take 
back the Senate.”
When asked what draws 
her to Warren, Sobel said she 
looks for a candidate who is 
data- and policy-driven.
“That kind of intellectual 
honesty is refreshing,” Sobel 
said. “She has plans for all of 
the things that really need to 
be done. It’s policy-based, it’s 
not personality-based, it’s not 
faux populism.”
Recent University alum 
and admissions representa-
tive Chloe Hypes also attend-
ed the Warren watch party, 
explaining she likes War-
ren’s progressive policies on 
climate change and women’s 
rights. Being from a rural 
area of Michigan, Hypes said 
she’s looking for a candidate 
who can unify voters across 
the political spectrum.
“Both being from Ann 
Arbor and from a rural area, 
I’ve seen a pretty big politi-
cal divide,” Hypes said. “So 
I think candidates need to 
acknowledge that and figure 
out a way to bridge that gap.”
Grant came to the Washt-
enaw for Warren watch party 
with a friend because neither 

of them have TV’s to watch 
the debates. Other graduate 
students were offered the 
same opportunity at another 
watch party, hosted by Rack-
ham Student Government at 
Bar Louie on Tuesday eve-
ning.
Marshall Case, Rackham 
student and student govern-
ment external affairs offi-
cer, said the event was “back 
by popular demand” after 
the success of a party they 
held to watch the first set of 
Democratic debates in June. 
They hosted more than 60 
attendees on Tuesday, leav-
ing standing room only on 
Bar Louie’s patio deck.
“Rackham student gov-
ernment 
is 
looking 
to 
sponsor events to build 
a 
graduate 
community 
outside of the academic 
environment,” Case said. 
“Watching the debates in 
a group fosters discussion. 
Some people want to sit 
back and watch with people, 
others want to debate with 
their friends. It’s all about a 
sense of community.”

The University of Michi-
gan is under public criticism 
for investing in a company 
involved in evictions in Detroit 
following a Bridge Magazine 
article published mid-July. 
In February 2018, the Uni-
versity’s Board of Regents 
approved a $30 million dollar 
investment into the Detroit 
Renaissance Real Estate Fund 
LP, a Metro Detroit fund which 
invests in single and multi-fam-
ily homes. Fortus Partners is a 
general partner for the fund, 
and the report claims a For-
tus Partners-owned company 
bought 112 homes, 47 of which 
were occupied at the time of 
foreclosure, and filed for evic-
tion for 20 of them.
A week after the Bridge 
article was released, Univer-
sity students, staff and fac-
ulty appeared before at the 
Regents meeting to ask Univer-
sity administration to halt their 
investment. An online peti-
tion, which as of publication 
has more than 400 signatures, 
was also started for the same 
purpose. 
The petition was started by 
Joel Batterman, a University 
Ph.D. student of Urban Plan-
ning and Development. Batter-
man said he is appalled at the 
University’s actions. 
“It struck me as outra-
geous that the University has 
invested in a company that was 
profiting off the foreclosure 
process, in particular, off the 
purchase of occupied homes,” 
Batterman said.
Alexa Eisenberg is a doctor-
al candidate with the School of 
Public Health and a researcher 
with 
University 
President 
Mark Schissel’s Poverty Solu-
tions, an initiative to find ways 
to “prevent and alleviate pov-
erty 
through 
action-based 

research.” She was present at 
the board meeting and was one 
of the speakers alongside Bat-
terman. 
In an interview with The 
Daily, 
Eisenberg 
expressed 
concern the investment could 
weaken the impact of her work, 
which she explained depends 
on the relationships she builds.
“(The investment) damages 
trust and undermines rela-
tionships that researchers and 
the University have built with 
community-based 
organiza-
tions and people in the city of 
Detroit,” Eisenberg said. 
Fortus responds
Corey Hanker and Jordan 
Friedman 
co-founded 
For-
tus Partners with a mission 
to increase the availability of 
affordable, 
quality 
housing 
by rehabilitating single- and 
multi-family homes and apart-
ments.
After the Bridge Magazine 
article was published, Fortus 
claimed there were a number 
of inaccuracies which por-
trayed the company poorly, and 
released a guest commentary 
on the story. 
Friedman, managing part-
ner of Fortus Partners, is aware 
of the online petition. 
“We didn’t bid on occupied 
homes,” Friedman said. “We 
bid on unoccupied homes. 
After we did ... someone broke 
into the house.”
Friedman stated Fortus only 
buys unoccupied properties 
through open, public sales. 
“We see all these addresses 
around September, and we’re 
allowed to inspect the exteri-
or,” Friedman explained. “We 
physically went to every single 
property, 
inspecting 
these 
properties from the outside 
and making sure that from the 
outside, they’re unoccupied.”

n the winter of 2018, a 
record 
number 
of 
bee 
colonies 
died 
in 
the 
United States. Beekeepers lost 
a daunting near 40 percent of 
their honeybee colonies due to 
a few detrimental factors. The 
threat to bees has been an issue 
for many years and may create 
drastic changes to the fabric 
of human agriculture. Yet, this 
topic is often overlooked or not 
met with the immediate action 
it deserves.
Our 
bee 
neighbors 
may 
not 
be 
human, 
but 
their 
services to the human race are 
unparalleled. They provide vast 
pollination across the country. 
Of the 369,000 plant species, 
90 
percent 
are 
dependent 
on pollination via insects. If 
bees continue to die out, wild 
flora and crops will become 
less healthy and unviable for 
commerce. Without the insect 
pollination, 
plants 
would 
remain unfertilized and would 
not be able to produce seeds. It is 
clear that the wellbeing of bees 
is integral to plant life. If plants 
are neglected and pollinators 
are unable to continue their 
job, farmers and markets will 
lose product. This chain of 
events could lead to diminished 
access to healthy and fresh 
foods and a destruction of the 
economic market. These real 
threats, as well as the looming 
endangerment 
of 
bees, 
are 
enough for me to believe that 
we need to work to save our 
pollinators.

The few ways to directly 
protect bees are, unfortunately, 
outisde 
of 
most 
people’s 
control. For example, farmers 
and industries should not use 
pesticides, 
neonicotinoids 
or 
GMOs as they can harm bees’ 
immune 
systems, 
and 
even 
kill them, if in contact with 
a 
chemically 
covered 
plant. 
Of course, the decision to use 
these chemicals is entirely at 
the discretion of the farmer or 
owner. They may decide the 
benefits of pesticides outweigh 
the risks of killing bees. Yet, 
this outlook seems ironic since 
killing bees will eventually lead 
to the decreased pollination and 
death of plants. It is a cycle that 
everyone should be educated on 
to understand the consequences 
attached to spraying pesticides.
The fight against pesticides 
has been difficult. Even though 
there is an abundant amount 
of evidence that pesticides are 
harmful, there has been very 
little action taken to eradicate 
their use. Maryann Frazier, a 
retired associate at the College 
of 
Agricultural 
Sciences 
at 
Pennsylvania State University, 
discusses this issue. She stated 
“I don’t expect to see a change in 
losses over time for this reason. 
There’s 
been 
no 
significant 
effort to correct what’s causing 
the decline … There’s a huge 
amount of data (and) research 
showing 
pesticides 
are 
a 
significant player in the decline 
of honeybees and other insect 
species. And yet there’s been 

so little done to make a change 
on that front. The EPA has been 
incredibly ineffective.”
Pesticide 
industry 
leaders 
seem to be avoiding the negative 
effects 
their 
products 
have 
on wildlife. Pesticides are the 
start of a downward spiral for 
the safety of bees and plants. 
According to Frazier, important 
figures tend to cover up their 
own business and hand in the 
destruction of bees by pointing 
out Varroa mites and viruses.
Varroa mites, viruses and 
other pests are a danger to 
bees and their hives. Parasites 
attack honeybees and kill them 
off at alarming rates. This 
natural invasion of a honeybee 
hive definitely plays a role in 
decreasing 
bee 
populations, 
but 
the 
fact 
that 
powerful 
leaders in business and politics 
shift their institutional harm 
onto these faceless parasites 
is irresponsible. People who 
hold positions of power in the 
pesticide industry or in the 
EPA should be owning up to the 
impacts humans have on climate 
change and wildlife. Due to the 
fact that climate change alters 
seasonal timing, flowers and 
crops are blooming at different 
rates. This unpredictable effect 
makes it difficult for bees to 
pollinate correctly and in a 
timely 
manner. 
Government 
figures have the means to enact 
sustainable policies for the crop 
industry and could be pouring 
their resources into saving our 
natural pollinators.

Bee kind to pollinators

Since 
we 
cannot 
always 
rely on industry bosses to 
make changes for the future 
of bees, community members 
are beginning to take mat-
ters into their own backyards. 
Stuart Anderson invented a 
way to make beekeeping more 
accessible to homes around the 
world. He invented the “Flow 
Hive,” which allows the keeper 
to pull a lever and release the 
delicious, flowing honey. They 
have managed to already sell 
thousands of hives in 130 coun-
tries across the world. This 
invention creates an ease for 
beekeepers, and I think this 
ease will incentivize beekeep-
ing even more.

If more people can learn 
about the importance of bees, 
plant flowers for them and even 
keep hives in their yards, bee 
genetic diversity will increase 
around the world. This diver-
sity will ultimately help bees 
fortify their immune systems, 
strengthen colonies and resist 
the harms of pesticides. The 
backyard hobby of beekeeping 
contributes to an important 
cause and helps pollinators and 
plant diversity. Let us all bring 
bees into our communities and 
live under the realm of their 
golden glide.

F

or the past several years, 
European political cover-
age has focused almost sole-
ly on the rise of the far right — and 
not without reason. Far-right par-
ties have gained voters in “progres-
sive” countries like Germany and 
France, and have even managed to 
win outright majorities in Poland 
and Hungary. However, while the 
far-right may be grabbing all the 
headlines, another movement is 
beginning to make its presence felt 
in European politics: green parties.
Long thought of as the quirky 
little brother of the European 
left, green parties across Europe 
have recently emerged as legiti-
mate electoral powers capable of 
winning seats in Parliaments and 
impacting mainstream political 
discourse. Green parties through-
out Europe have crafted a wholly 
progressive identity which sets 
them apart from traditional center-
left parties, focusing not only on 
environmental protection (as the 
name would suggest), but also on 
fighting economic inequality and 
promoting multiculturalism. In an 
era where political leanings cor-
relate heavily with age and educa-
tion level, the Greens seem to be 
the leftist party of the future, with 
ideologies that are highly attractive 
to young and well-educated voters. 
Compared to established par-
ties, European green parties are a 
relatively new phenomenon. The 
German Green Party, probably 
the biggest and most influential in 
Europe, wasn’t founded until 1980, 
while Germany’s premier center-
left party, the SPD, was founded 
in 1875. Similarly, the French, 
Austrian and Dutch Green Parties 
weren’t established until 1984, 1986 
and 1989, respectively. During their 
early years, green parties across the 
continent found little success, and 
were often barely able to win seats 
in their respective nations’ parlia-
ments. The German Greens con-
sistently won only about 6 percent 
of the vote during the two decades 
after their founding, and their 
most notable contribution was 
controversy, which they provided 
when their members chose to wear 
sweaters and other business-casual 
attire into the Bundestag (German 
government building) instead of 
suits.
Throughout the 1990s and 
2000s, European Green Parties 
remained largely irrelevant. In 
many cases they were their nation’s 
third-most influential leftist party, 
behind both traditional moderate 

leftist parties and free-market cen-
trist parties, who were often key 
for forming left-wing coalitions. 
Though they would occasionally 
serve in these governing coalitions, 
they were never major players, and 
their views were often outside the 
mainstream left.
However, the 2019 European 
Parliamentary Elections were a 
watershed moment for the Greens. 
After winning 48 seats in the 2009 
elections and 50 in the 2014 elec-
tions, the Green Coalition won 74 
seats in the 2019 elections, placing 
them fourth overall (and ahead of 
the highly-touted far-right coali-
tion). Crucially, Greens did well in 
several major countries: they came 
second in Germany, and third in 
France and the UK. This showing 
seems to have boosted the domes-
tic fortunes of green parties across 
the continent: The Greens are 
now polling as the second-most 
popular party in Germany, and are 
gaining popularity in France and 
Austria as well. 

Looking at the foundations 
of the Green Party movement, 
it’s actually not surprising that 
the Greens are on the rise across 
Europe, as the party has success-
fully corned two demographic 
groups: young voters and highly-
educated voters. The Green’s 
flagship issue is climate change, 
due to citizens across the conti-
nent becoming more and more 
concerned about the threat it 
poses. A Pew Survey from 2017 
found that 64 percent of Europe-
ans believed climate change was 
a major threat to their respective 
counties. Unsurprisingly, the age 
demographic 
most 
concerned 
with climate change was young 
people, something which trans-
lates to support for green parties; 
in the 2017 German Elections, 
Green Party voters had the lowest 
average age.
Additionally, another Pew sur-
vey found that, while young Euro-
pean voters are just as likely as the 

general populace to be leftist, they 
are less supportive of traditional 
moderate leftist parties, leaving an 
opening on which the Green Party 
can capitalize. As climate change 
becomes an even more important 
issue going forward, the Greens’ 
progressive stance will likely pay 
dividends, allowing parties across 
Europe to capture a greater and 
greater share of young and envi-
ronmentally conscious voters. 
In addition to protecting the 
environment, green parties also 
promote diversity and multicultur-
alism, which helps them appeal to 
more educated European voters. 
Surveyed citizens of nearly every 
European country say their nation 
has become more diverse in the 
past 20 years, making diversity a 
political issue. While there is no 
overwhelming consensus on the 
merits of diversity, the young and 
well-educated strongly favor it and 
believe it is a positive development.
By focusing on climate change 
and 
diversity, 
green 
parties 
throughout Europe have set them-
selves up to be the leftist parties 
of the future. While green parties 
support the standard economi-
cally progressive ideas that all left-
ist parties support, their specific 
focus on issues beyond that has 
allowed them to win new voters 
who felt unimpressed with center-
left establishment parties. Though 
left-wing views have historically 
been associated with lower-class 
urban workers (many of whom 
were part of labor unions, hence 
the birth of “labor” parties), this 
connection weakened over time as 
demographics shifted. As working-
class union members were primar-
ily interested in leftist economic 
policies, which ensured they would 
be protected from corporate over-
lords, labor parties are lead to focus 
primarily on fighting economic 
inequality. However, times have 
changed, and the Greens’ environ-
mentally and socially conscious 
brand of progressivism is well-
suited for contemporary Europe, 
where left-wing voters are increas-
ingly more likely to be young, 
well-educated and urban. Though 
it won’t happen instantly, and it 
may take years, if not decades, the 
Greens’ vision for contemporary 
leftism will allow green parties 
across the continent win over new 
voters and grow into major politi-
cal forces.

The European left’s future looks green

O

n July 25, the United States 
Attorney General announced 
that the federal government 
would once again practice capital 
punishment in relation to five death-
row inmates convicted of murder, 
torture and rape of children and the 
elderly. The executions, scheduled for 
December and January, are the first to 
be carried out by the federal govern-
ment since 2003. 
There is no doubt that the crimes 
committed by these individuals are 
objectively heinous, and deserve to 
be punished to the fullest extent of 
the law. But that leads to the ques-
tion: Should the system allow for such 
an extreme and brutal sentence? To 
some, the answer is a clear “yes.” After 
all, why should we go easy on perpe-
trators who so viciously hurt the most 
innocent groups among us? It seems 
like a logical conclusion: a literal “taste 
of their own medicine” form of justice. 
However, I would argue that capital 
punishment is not true justice and is 
not just morally wrong, but is uncon-
stitutional.
First, let’s examine what hints the 
Constitution might offer. The Eighth 
Amendment in the U.S. Constitution 
states that “Excessive bail shall not be 
required, nor excessive fines imposed, 
nor cruel and unusual punishments 
inflicted.” This ultimately begs the 
question: What is more cruel and 
unusual than state-sponsored kill-
ings? When I hear the phrase “cruel 
and unusual,” images of 18th cen-
tury France and the guillotine bubble 
into my mind, where citizens were 
beheaded in the thousands in a period 
that came to be known as La Terreur 
(scarily enough, the guillotine was not 
outlawed in France until 1981 when 
the country abolished the use of capi-
tal punishment).
The vagueness of the clause in the 
Bill of Rights was written that way 
on purpose — “cruel and unusual” is 
inherently subjective, and is meant 
to adapt to society’s progression. It is 
the same reason the wording states 
limits on “excessive bail” as opposed 
to a specific dollar amount: The fram-
ers understood that inflation changes 
over time and that it should be at the 
discretion of the system to determine 
what constitutes excessive at the time 
of sentencing. Whether or not one feels 
capital punishment is “unususal,” it 
ought to fall under the “cruel” category, 
as executions have been proven to be 
excruciatingly painful, and often go 
botched. Many legal scholars disagree 
that it violates the Eighth Amend-
ment, and both state and federal courts 
have had differing decisions regarding 
appeals. I am by no means a constitu-

tional expert, and thus am willing to 
concede that this argument may lean 
on a simple side. 
But beyond how one interprets 
the constitution, capital punishment 
is, in my opinion, ethically and mor-
ally wrong. The decision to sentence 
someone to death is an independent 
 
one; regardless of what crimes they 
committed. At the end of the day, 
no matter how evil the felon or how 
depraved their acts, no punishment 
can bring back the deceased or undo 
the wrongdoings. At the end of the 
day, we are choosing to kill them from 
our own hate, not from any notion of 
justice; it becomes an exercise of our 
own cruelty. 
Let’s consider the argument that it is 
fair simply by way of it being reserved 
for only those who commit the most 
extreme atrocities, and therefore is 
neither cruel nor unusual. This phi-
losophy makes us no better than the 
guilty parties. I empathize with vic-
tims, and understand why some feel it 
is fair by way of “eye for an eye.” Yet, we 
established our criminal justice system 
with ideals based in fairness and jus-
tice — the very reason that Lady Jus-
tice is blind and holds a sword in one 
hand and a scale in the other. Despite 
the countless shortfalls of the system to 
operate how it is meant to, that does not 
mean we shouldn’t strive for more. We 
need to rise above, not sink to a lower 
level. 
It is also worth mentioning the 
statistics and data that point to capi-
tal punishment being unnecessary. 
A recent study in Louisiana showed 
that the state spends an extra $15 mil-
lion more per year than it would in a 
system with life without parole as the 
maximum sentence. In Tennessee, 
one report found that capital pun-
ishment trials cost 50 percent more 
than life-sentencing trials. If you are 
unconvinced that the death penalty is 
morally wrong, then statistics such as 
these ought to show what a massive 
burden it is on our criminal justice 
system. Most states’ criminal justice 
systems are severely underfunded; 
imagine the benefits of directing 
these funds elsewhere. Additionally, 
previous biases within the criminal 
justice system that disproportionately 
target minorities is an important con-
cern to raise. According to an article 
from NPR, 41.7 percent of death row 
inmates are Black, despite Black peo-
ple making up 13.1 percent of the total 
U.S. population in 2014. 

We should kill capital punishment

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“You can never publish my 
love,” Rogue Wave chants, in the 
song that the title of this series 
riffs on. Maybe that’s true, and 
we can never quite account for 
our love on paper or in print, but 
we sure can try. That’s what this 
series is devoted to: publishing 
our love. Us, the Arts section of 
The Michigan Daily, talking about 
artists, some of the people we love 
the most. Perhaps these are futile 
approximations of love for the 
poet who told us we deserve to be 
heard, the director who changed 
the way we see the world, the 
singer we see as an old friend. But 
who ever said futile can’t still be 
beautiful?
In 2013, an obscure, post-met-
al outfit released its sophomore 
record, the psychedelic, blaring-
ly tender Sunbather. The album’s 
artwork is simple and unforget-
table: a pleasant salmon gradient 
overlaid with white, stripped-to-
the-bone minimal lettering that 
spells out the title in three rows 
and three columns. That is to say, 
Sunbather’s aesthetic is far from 
what most would consider metal. 
And yet appearances are deceiv-
ing. 
If Sunbather proved anything, 
it’s that the primal shrieks, the 

thundering blast beats and the 
dissonant tremolo guitar chords 
of black metal can push into the 
fringes of mainstream when 
packaged in just the right way. 
Indeed, when Sunbather first 
broke through with a devout cult 
of listeners, it wasn’t treated like 
a metal album, but rather like 
something amorphous, the lost 
mutant child of post-punk and 
dream pop that had suddenly 
found its way back into the popu-
lar consciousness. 
Only years afterward did I 
discover the album myself. Like 
many other metalheads who 
propelled the album’s second 
wave of influence, I heard about 
Sunbather through the esoteric 
term “blackgaze.” “Blackgaze” 
was what people were calling 
this new stylized aggression, a 
hybrid of black metal and shoe-
gaze. I was immediately drawn 
into the sheer craft of the music, 
vividly aware that mention of the 
album’s style as its own subgenre 
were more than valid. It didn’t 
take me long to reckon with and 
accept the fact that a band called 
Deafheaven was profoundly and 
irreversibly 
shaping 
modern 
metal. 
I return time and time to 
Deafheaven because I discover 
something new on every listen, a 
quality that I find bitterly rare in 
experimental metal. Deafheav-
en’s ability to construct hazy, 

intensely 
evolving 
emotional 
journeys through a framework 
of traditional metal expanded 
my entire notion of what metal 
could be. That’s not to say that 
modern metal lacks emotion, 
or that it must even harness the 
very intimate to succeed. What 
Deafheaven offers that other 
current metal doesn’t is a range 
of feelings, some happy, some 
sad, most fleeting and impos-
sible to qualify. 
There’s something alchemical 
about the way that Deafheaven 
captures and builds upon the 
ephemeral. The band’s songwrit-
ing process is so singular in its 
vision, so personally embrac-
ing, that certain playthroughs 
of their albums embed them-
selves starkly in my memories. 
I can recall with remarkable 
ease everything I was doing and 
everything I was feeling dur-
ing one particular time I heard 
their third album New Bermuda. 
A specific afternoon after an 
algebra exam, a specific walk 
on a Florida beach. I, like many 
others, have similar experiences 
with albums important to me in 
my most formative and impres-
sionable years. But only a hand-
ful of artists can clearly capture 
the relationship between a mem-
ory and the moment.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Chance the Rapper’s debut studio 
album The Big Day is inescapably, 
embarrassingly bad. It seems that 
in the three years between Coloring 
Book and The Big Day, Chance has 
lost some fundamental aspect of his 
musical identity. 
The first three songs present the 
only strong sequence of ideas to be 
found across the bloated, 22-track 
project. “All Day Long” is a high-
energy opener, nothing to write 
home about but fun enough to lis-
ten to. “Do You Remember” is a 
highlight, thanks in large part to an 
elegant if slightly mawkish hook, 
courtesy of Ben Gibbard. “Eternal” 
is a solid, groovy effort featuring a 
creative and soul-
ful 
verse 
from 
Smino.
After that, it all 
goes off the rails. If 
you’ve ever listened 
to “Womp Womp” 
by 
Valee 
and 
thought to yourself, 
“Man, I really like this song, but I 
wish it had more lines about trying 
to go to sleep and also was a whole 
lot worse in every way,” then I high-
ly recommend you check out “Hot 
Shower.” If you’re like me, and this 
does not sound like something you 
would enjoy, the track would best be 
skipped. Dababy provides some last-
second life support with an excellent 
verse, but it’s not enough to redeem 
this subpar, plagiaristic misfire.
The next three songs (“We Go 
High,” “I Got You (Always and For-
ever)” and “Roo”) are good efforts 
and worth giving a listen if you’re 
attuned to Chance’s overarching 
vision. Everything after that ranges 
from forgettable to embarrass-
ing. There are so many confound-
ing decisions Chance made here. 
Why are there almost five minutes 
worth of skits? Why did the mad-
dening “Found a Good One (Single 
No More)” merit inclusion on an 
already-bloated tracklist? Why is he 
letting every single guest who isn’t 
named MadeinTYO or Francis Star-
lite outshine him? Why did he think 
“Hey there, lovely sister / Won’t you 
come home to your mister? / I’ve 

got plans to hug and kiss ya” (“Let’s 
Go On The Run”) was a good line? I 
don’t have the answers. 
“The Big Day,” the title track, the 
centerpiece of the album’s narrative, 
is an incoherent mess. The lyrics are 
laughable: “The only way to survive 
is to go crazy” sounds like some-
thing Heath Ledger’s Joker would 
say. The beat is slow and plodding, 
creating a sense of claustropho-
bic anxiety that I’m certain wasn’t 
intended to be conveyed on a happy 
song about his wedding day. Fran-
cis Starlite’s vocals are terrible. The 
jarring screaming halfway through 
the track, aside from sounding sus-
piciously similar to Frank Ocean’s 
outro on “Biking,” is a complete and 
utter failure that takes the listener 
out of whatever semblance of an 
emotional atmosphere that has been 
created up to that point. 
As a fan of most 
of Chance’s previ-
ous work, I find 
The Big Day to be 
bitterly disappoint-
ing. This is the type 
of album that you 
release after you’ve 
surrounded your-
self with yes men and spent your 
free time shooting Kit-Kat commer-
cials and riffing with the Wendy’s 
Twitter account. This is the type of 
album you make when you’re resting 
on your laurels. 
It seems as though Chance has 
lost the ability to make his life seem 
compelling. Where did his sense 
of humor go? His willingness to be 
weird and experimental seems to 
now be limited to trying on the styl-
ings of other artists, mere artistic 
mimesis. The vibrancy of 10 Day, 
Acid Rap and Coloring Book are 
nowhere to be found, and it’s hard to 
believe that the person responsible 
for those three projects was involved 
with The Big Day at all. 
Listening to The Big Day produc-
es in me the same uneasy feeling as 
watching a commercial, the sense 
that I am being somehow tricked. 
It is plastic soul, the worst effort 
Chance has put out to date, and (puts 
fingers to temples) I predict it will be 
nominated for several Grammys. 
I fear that this record is so tedious 
and self-absorbed as to be indicative 
of the end of Chance’s artistic rel-
evance. I hope he proves me wrong.

Chance’s album 
is just plastic soul

Chance the Rapper

DESIGN BY KATHRYN HALVERSON


Mo Pop returned to West Riv-
erfront Park for its seventh year 
this July, this time bringing two 
of music’s most acclaimed acts to 
headline: Vampire Weekend and 
Tame Impala. This year’s edition 
also brought some of the indus-
try’s fastest-rising stars to Detroit, 
with singers and bands like Yel-
low Days, Goth Babe, Roy Blair 
and Tiny Moving Parts taking the 
stage.
Vampire Weekend headlined 
Saturday night, putting on a mind-
blowing, 
passion-filled 
perfor-
mance. Their seven-member suite 
played more instruments than I 
could count — I lost track when 
the bongos came out. The crowd 
bobbed to the groove of “Sun-
flower,” and the dancing stretched 
from the front row back to the tech 
booth as “This Life” captured the 
summertime vibe of Mo Pop. Ezra 
Koenig made for a more dramatic 
and impressive live singer than I 
ever could have imagined in the 
studio version of “Harmony Hall.” 
His ethereal vocals enchanted the 
festival after the sun went down 
and the stars began shining, both 
literally in the sky and metaphori-
cally as Vampire Weekend rocked 
out onstage.
Hearing old hits like “Oxford 

Comma” and “A-Punk” reminded 
me that the band is really from 
before my time. I was especially 
reminded of it when Koenig gave a 
shout out to everyone in the crowd 
who came to their first Michi-
gan performance in Ann Arbor 
in 2007. A group of festival-goers 
beside me from the University all 
turned to each other and smiled in 
mutual understanding — we were 
doing multiplication tables and 
watching Spongebob when Vam-
pire Weekend first came to our 
current home.
Closing out the festival Sun-
day night was Tame Impala, who 
drew the biggest crowd I’ve ever 
seen, stretching from the stage 
across half the length of the fes-
tival grounds. Kevin Parker and 
his team of live performers took 
the stage in grandeur, launching 
confetti into the sky over the audi-
ence as they whirled and reeled 
to a harmonious clatter of instru-
ments. Just as the performance 
was teeming with trippy imag-
ery, Parker himself sounded like 
he was tripping: “Great, this is 
good, I feel good,” he said between 
laughs. “There’s a bug in my drink 
… it’s a Detroit bug … it’s good for 
you.” Between songs, a fan in the 
crowd screamed, “SEND ME, 
KEVIN!” and Kevin answered his 
call by playing “Let It Happen.” 
Let it happen we did.
Tame Impala live is an experi-
ence worlds apart from the stu-

dio version. While the main beats 
of each song remained, all of the 
tracks were stretched and warped, 
making for a hazy, dream-like ren-
dition of Parker’s peerless produc-
tion. Arms waving, hips swinging 
and heads bobbing, the crowd was 
spasmodic from start to finish. 
Motor City and all its visitors may 
have never been mesmerized so.
The headliners took the stage at 
night, but smaller acts made waves 
while the sun was still up. Alec 
Benjamin paid homage to Detroit’s 
own Eminem, singing a rendition 
of “Stan” infused with Benjamin’s 
sadboy energy. J.I.D. honored his 
forebears, playing A Tribe Called 
Quest’s “Scenario” as a lead into 
“EdEddnEddy.” The Story So 
Far had a nonstop moshpit and 
more crowdsurfers than security 
could keep up with. And Wallows 
rocked the river stage, although 
the 
“scrawny 
motherfucker(s) 
with the cool hairstyle(s)” had 
only mediocre hairstyles at best.
Country music also graced 
Mo Pop. Chicago band Whit-
ney rocked their set for a fervid 
crowd, impressive for a last-min-
ute addon, taking Noname’s place. 
Caamp brought the rawest of folk 
energy, beginning their set with 
only guitar, bass, and banjo. At 
one point, a man walked on stage 
and lead singer Taylor Meier said, 
“This is my friend Joe. He’s gonna 
play piano.” Sure enough, Meier’s 
friend Joe played piano.

Among all the acts, it was clear 
who really ran Mo Pop: the women. 
Queer icons like King Princess, 
Siena Liggins and Lindsey Jor-
dan (of Snail Mail fame) were the 
greatest stars and brought power-
ful performances. Kali Uchis and 
Ella Mai, R&B’s reigning queens, 
took 
listeners 
through 
soulful 
journeys of heart-
break and love. 
Their supporting 
bands 
brought 
a new intensity 
to 
their 
music, 
revealing emotion 
and 
spirit 
that 
could only be felt 
live. There was 
no doubt that this 
year, women were 
the ones running 
shit.
To that end, It 
was Lizzo who 
took the crown at 
Mo Pop 2019. There was nothing 
she couldn’t do: Singing, danc-
ing, butt shaking and flute play-
ing, she performed with all her 
heart before pouring it out to the 
audience, talking about visiting 
her family during her return to 
her hometown of Detroit. As she 
described the feeling of seeing her 
face on a billboard overlooking the 

city, she came to the verge of tears, 
and so did many listeners around 
me (myself included). In her “spe-
cial discount,” Lizzo declared 
everybody in the audience, no mat-
ter their shape or size, was blessed 
to be a thick bitch for the duration 
of her performance. Between all 
the body positiv-
ity and embrac-
ing who you are, 
Lizzo made Mo 
Pop a celebration 
of self love.
Mo Pop 2019 
made for a hot 
girl 
summer 
to 
remember. 
The 
festival 
is 
unique in that all 
performers 
go 
back-to-back 
on 
alternating stages, 
so 
festival-goers 
don’t 
have 
to 
miss a single set. 
It exposes listen-
ers to music they may never have 
listened to before — I saw many 
of the same people getting down 
to hip hop before singing along 
to country, grooving to R&B as 
hard as they moshed to pop punk. 
There wasn’t just something for 
everybody; everything was for 
everybody. But Mo Pop was for the 
ladies, most of all.

FESTIVAL COVERAGE


The most heavily discussed 
topics on Wednesday night were 
health 
care, 
immigration 
and 
criminal justice, while climate 
change and foreign policy, while 
discussed, were among topics 
receiving less airtime.
Many of the candidates now 
support Medicare-for-all, insofar 
as it means creating a public option 
for health insurance into which any 
citizen can buy. One of the main 
divides that has opened within the 
healthcare debate, however, has 
been whether to keep an option for 
private, employer-provided health 
insurance, which only Warren and 
Sanders have opposed.
Unlike many others, Biden does 
not support Medicare-for-all, and 
on Wednesday night criticized 
Harris’s plan for its high cost. 
Harris, by contrast, criticized 
Biden’s plan for failing to cover 
every citizen.
Yang argued Democrats had 
been discussing Medicare-for-all in 
the wrong ways, pointing out that it 
took the burden off of businesses to 
provide healthcare for employees.
“As 
someone 
who’s 
run 
a 
business, I can tell you flat out our 
current health care system makes 
it harder to hire, it makes it harder 
to treat people well and give them 
benefits and treat them as full-
time employees, it makes it harder 
to switch jobs, as Senator Harris 
just said, and it’s certainly a lot 
harder to start a business,” Yang 
said. “If we say, look, we’re going 
to get health care off the backs 
of businesses and families, then 
watch American entrepreneurship 
recover and bloom.” 
On the issue of immigration in 
particular, candidates took the 
opportunity to go after Biden, 
criticizing him for his part in the 
record number of deportations 
which occurred under the Obama 
Administration.

Castro, who put forward his plan 
to decriminalize border crossings 
and invest millions of dollars 
in Honduras, El Salvador and 
Guatemala as part of a “21st Century 
Marshall Plan,” acknowledged his 
role in the Obama administration 
by telling Biden, “one of us has 
learned the lessons of the past and 
one of us hasn’t.”
At one point as Biden was 
discussing 
immigration, 
he 
was interrupted by protesters 
criticizing his record in the Obama 
Administration, chanting “Three 
million deportations!” Biden said 
unauthorized 
border 
crossings 
should continue to be treated as a 
crime and that “people should have 
to get in line.”
“And by the way, anybody that 
crosses the stage with a PhD, you 
should get a green card for seven 
years,” Biden said. “We should keep 
them here.”
Booker 
contradicted 
Biden, 
connecting his comment to one 
made by President Trump in which 
he said he wants fewer immigrants 
from “shithole countries.”
“That’s 
playing 
into 
what 
the Republicans want, to pit 
some immigrants against other 
immigrants. 
Some 
are 
from 
‘shithole’ countries and some are 
from ‘worthy’ countries,” Booker 
said. “We need to reform this whole 
immigration system and begin to 
be the country that says everyone 
has worth and dignity and this 
should be a country that honors for 
everyone.”
Of all the candidates, Inslee 
discussed climate change the 
most, and was the only one to 
name it as a priority. He pointed 
out that while it was everyone’s 
problem, it was Democrats’ duty 
to deliver justice to poor and 
minority communities like those 
in southwest Detroit, who suffer 
from disproportionate rates of 
asthma and lung disease due to 
air pollution.

Delaney, Bullock and Ryan 
all supported health care plans 
offering both private and public 
options, agreeing it wouldn’t be 
worthwhile to take away private 
health care from those who like it.
“At the end of the day, I’m not 
going to support any plan that 
rips away quality health care from 

individuals,” Bullock said. “This is 
an example of wish list economics. 
It used to be just Republicans who 
wanted to repeal and replace. Now 
many Democrats do, as well.”
Buttigieg and O’Rourke shared 
similar policies. They supported 
a plan with several insurance 
options as well as Medicare for 
those who need it.
“We don’t have to stand up 
here speculating about whether 
the public option will be better or 
a Medicare for All environment 

will be better than the corporate 
options,” 
Buttigieg 
said. 
“We 
can put it to the test. That’s the 
concept of my Medicare for All 
Who Want It proposal. That way, 
if people like me are right that the 
public alternative is going to be 
not only more comprehensive, but 
more affordable than any of the 
corporate options around there. 
we’ll see Americans walk away 
from the corporate options into 
that Medicare option, and it will 
become Medicare for All without 

us having to kick anybody off their 
insurance.”
O’Rourke 
also 
shared 
his 
disapproval of increasing taxes for 
the middle class to support health 
care reform.
“The middle class will not pay 
more in taxes in order to ensure 
that every American is guaranteed 
world-class health care,” O’Rourke 
said. “I think we’re being offered a 
false choice.”
Williamson 
said 
she 
understands the argument behind 

maintaining 
privatized 
health 
care. This statement prompted 
a debate between Warren and 
Sanders — both strong supporters 
of Medicare for all plans — and the 
other candidates on stage.
Warren 
said 
pushing 
the 
idea of rising taxes was a tactic 
Republicans have used in the 
past to paint the plan in a 
negative light.

Michigan football, basketball each self-report one NCAA violation

The Michigan football and 
men’s 
basketball 
programs 
each reported one minor NCAA 
violation in recent months, per 
records obtained by The Daily via 
the Freedom of Information Act.
Michigan 
football 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh, 
director 
of 
recruiting 
Matt 
Dudek, 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown, cornerbacks coach Mike 
Zordich, offensive line coach Ed 
Warinner, wide receivers coach 
Ben McDaniels and tight ends 
coach Sherrone Moore violated 
the NCAA dead period in January. 
McDaniels was an analyst when 
the violation occurred.
Because of a scheduling error 
by Dudek, the coaches made visits 
to high schools during the dead 
period, during which schools 
are not allowed to have contact 
with athletes or their parents, 
watch them compete or visit their 
schools. One prospect, unnamed 
in the report, took an unofficial 
visit during the period as well.
Though Dudek was off by just 

one day — thinking contact was 
allowed on Jan. 10 when the 
period lasted until Jan. 11 — eight 
Michigan coaches visited 25 high 
schools illegally. According to the 
report filed by the University, all of 
the trips were to evaluate recruits, 
as none were of a contactable age.
Michigan 
avoided 
serious 
punishment, as the violation was 
not intentional and classified as 
a Level III violation. As a self-
imposed penalty, coaches were 
not allowed to recruit off-campus 
on Jan. 19, 20, 26 and 27, as well as 
Feb. 2. They were also prohibited 
from contacting the prospect who 
unofficially visited for two weeks, 
and had a reduction of 14 recruiting 
person days between the spring 
and fall evaluation, per the report. 
Dudek was issued a letter of 
admonishment. The NCAA did 
not impose an additional penalty 
on the program.
That was the only self-reported 
violation by the football program 
this calendar year, while Ohio 
State committed six over the last 
academic year, per a report by 
Eleven Warriors this week.
As for the basketball program, 

assistant coach Saddi Washington 
sent 
an 
impermissible 
text 
message to a 2021 recruit’s parent 
last Oct. 4. Contact prior to June 
15 after a prospect’s sophomore 
year in high school is forbidden.
This was also classified as a 
Level III violation, though there 
was comparatively little action 

taken. Michigan’s staff couldn’t 
contact that recruit for two weeks 
after June 15. John Beilein’s 
program had a sterling reputation 
when it came to the NCAA 
rulebook — even a small violation 
comes as a surprise.
Washington 
was 
the 
only 
assistant coach retained by new 

head coach Juwan Howard.
Spokespeople 
for 
both 
the 
football and basketball teams 
declined comment.
Michigan State basketball self-
reported two NCAA violation this 
season, per MLive, as did Ohio 
State, per the Eleven Warriors 
report.

Michigan to pay out $485,000 to non-conference opponents

Michigan’s 
non-conference 
basketball schedule is complete, 
and the athletic department willl 
be writing out a handsome check 
to go with it.
The school will pay out a total 
of $485,000 to its guarantee 
opponents, 
per 
documents 
obtained by The Daily via the 
Freedom of Information Act. 
This includes games against 
Appalachian State, Elon, Houston 
Baptist, Presbyterian and UMass 
Lowell, as well as an exhibition 
contest against Saginaw Valley 
State. Michigan will also make 
$75,000 from playing in the 
Battle 4 Atlantis, though its 
contract with the tournament 
organizers requires the school 
pay out $85,000 to a guarantee 
opponent for a home game 
sponsored by the tournament, 
which the Wolverines found in 
Elon.
The most Michigan pays out 
to a single opponent this season 

will be App State at a cool 
$100,000, with Houston Baptist, 
Presbyterian and UMass Lowell 
tied with $95,000 as runners up. 
The Wolverines will be heavy 
favorites in each of those games. 
Presbyterian held the highest 
KenPom ranking of those teams 
last season at 179 and finished 
with a 20-16 record in the Big 
South.
Under John Beilein, Michigan 
traditionally didn’t go out of 
its way to schedule tough non-
conference 
games. 
Juwan 
Howard’s first year will largely 
keep to that mold, though there 
are a few exceptions.
The 
Wolverines 
go 
to 
Louisville, expected to be one 
of the top teams in the country, 
for a December Big Ten/ACC 
Challenge game. They’ll also 
face stiff competition in the 
Bahamas, with Iowa State as 
their first opponent, followed 
by the winner of Alabama-North 
Carolina. 
Their 
third 
game 
could be against anyone on the 
other side of the bracket, which 

features Gonzaga, Seton Hall, 
Oregon and Southern MIss.
In 
a 
scheduling 
quirk, 
Michigan could play the Ducks 

three times in two years, as the 
two meet in Ann Arbor on Dec. 
14 in the first leg of a home-and-
home. The Wolverines also play 

Creighton, which finished with 
a solid record in the Big East 
last year, at home in the Gavitt 
Games.

Rosen, Jewell share special ‘reconnection’ on Foreign Tour

It took 21 years and 6,000 miles 
of travel, but Michigan volleyball 
coach Mark Rosen and Purdue 
assistant Kathy Jewell finally 
found themselves on the same 
side of the net again this summer.
To understand the sincerity 
of the reconnection, one must 
examine its roots. In the fall 
of 1994, Rosen and Jewell both 
arrived on campus at Northern 
Michigan 
University 
— 
the 
former 
as 
the 
newly-minted 
volleyball coach and the latter 
as an incoming freshman. Rosen 
and his wife Lesia went on to 
spend four years at Northern 
Michigan, guiding the Wildcats 
to 
a 
Division 
II 
national 
championship, runner-up finish 
and two Final Four defeats.
Jewell, meanwhile, was the 
difference maker in the Rosens’ 
successful tenure. Despite being 
undersized at 5-foot-6, she held 
her own as an outside hitter, 
earning a pair of NCAA Elite 
Eight 
All-Tournament 
Team 
selections 
and 
tallying 
the 
second-most digs in program 
history. She was inducted into 
the Northern Michigan Hall of 
Fame in 2000.
In 1998, Rosen and Jewell 
went their separate ways. Mark 
and Leisa took over at Boise 
State, while Jewell finished her 
bachelor’s degree in management 
of health and fitness.
Following 
her 
graduation 
from Northern Michigan, Jewell 
hadn’t made up her mind on a 
desired career and, admittedly, 
had no idea what she wanted 
to do. After spending a year 
coaching at the high school and 
club levels in her home state of 
Indiana, Jewell’s phone rang. 
Rosen’s voice was on the other 
line.
By that point, the Rosens 
had already made the leap to 
Ann Arbor. Mark was calling to 
inform Jewell that he submitted 
her name for coaching vacancies 
at Central Michigan and Toledo.
***
Jewell 
ultimately 
spent 
three years as an assistant with 
the Chippewas before joining 
Purdue’s staff in 2003, where 
she has spent the last 16 years. 
Since then, her former college 
coach has been one of her fiercest 
competitors.
When asked why she chose to 

go into coaching, Jewell didn’t 
hesitate to credit Rosen’s phone 
call. But to Rosen, it was the 
obvious path all along.
“She had all the makeup of 
(coaching),” Rosen said. “It didn’t 
surprise me at all when she went 
into coaching because she’s very 
much a student of the game. As 
a player, she was an undersized 
outside, so she had to be one of 
those players who learned the 
game very well in order to be 
successful.”
Recently, the two have clashed 
on the recruiting trail more than 
ever. With their teams typically 
finishing close to one another 
in the Big Ten standings, Rosen 
and Jewell often battle for the 
same high school prospects when 
they’re not trying to outduel each 
other during the season.
It was only fitting for the 
two to reunite on the Big Ten 
Foreign Tour, which saw 12 of 
the 
conference’s 
top 
players 
represent the Big Ten in Japan 
during 
a 
six-match 
summer 

swing.
For Rosen, the presence of a 
familiar face added a dimension 
of comfort to the uneasy dynamic 
of coaching the same opposing 
players that give him headaches 
during the season. On a personal 
level, it presented an opportunity 
to temporarily put their coaching 
competition aside.
“It’s kind of hard to have this 
really friendly relationship when 
you’re competing for the same 
players and you’re competing 
to beat each other during the 
season,” Rosen said. “That went 
away a little bit during that time 
because we were on the script 
together and coaching the team 
together. It just really brought 
that relationship back a little, 
which was really fun.
“To be honest, it was really 
cool. 
It 
was 
really 
fun 
to 
reconnect with her and spend 
some time not talking about 
volleyball, just talking about life 
and just sharing a trip together.”
***

Jewell isn’t the Rosens’ only 
alumna who has made their 
mark 
in 
college 
coaching. 
Loyola Maryland head coach 
Alija 
Pettinger 
and 
George 
Washington assistant Erin Moore 
— who graduated from Michigan 
in 2001 and 2004, respectively — 
are also active coaches, to name 
another two.
In Jewell’s eyes, playing for the 
Rosens made all the difference, 
and the Northern Michigan roots 
are as strong as ever.
“(Mark 
and 
Leisa) 
really 
helped mold me through my 
playing career and if I have 
questions or need something, I 
know I can reach out to either 
one of them for personal or 
professional help,” Jewell told 
The Daily in a phone interview 
last week. “They’re always there 
for me in that regard. As a player, 
they put me in my place at times 
but also challenged me to be the 
best competitor that I could be. 
I’m grateful to have those two in 
my life.”

The Big Ten Foreign Tour 
gave Rosen and Jewell a chance 
to reminisce over their 1994 
national 
championship 
run, 
catch up on life beyond the court 
and swap stories from the two 
decades since leaving Northern 
Michigan. The value of such an 
opportunity wasn’t overlooked, 
to say the least.
“We have a long history,” 
Jewell said. “By coaching against 
him and also seeing (Rosen) 
out recruiting, it’s just like an 
old friend kind of thing. It was 
really fun to be on that side and 
to see his style of coaching and 
interacting. It brought back a lot 
of memories from back in the day 
when he coached me.”
In four short months, these 
“old friends” will once again find 
themselves on opposite sides 
of the net in West Lafayette. 
But, for now, the heat of the 
competition can take a backseat 
to the reconnection — regardless 
of whichever side of the globe it 
happened on.

Though inexperienced, RB squad showing that it runs deep

For the first time in his tenure 
as head coach of the Michigan 
football team, Jim Harbaugh 
has 
stability 
and 
depth 
at 
the 
quarterback 
and 
wide 
receiver positions. With senior 
Shea Patterson and redshirt 
sophomore 
Dylan 
McCaffrey 
vying to man the offense and the 
experienced trio of junior wide 
receivers Tarik Black, Donovan 
Peoples-Jones and Nico Collins 
finally healthy, the Wolverines 
possess one of the best passing 
attacks in the Big Ten.
But one of the first questions 
that Harbaugh fielded at the 
Big Ten Football Media Day on 
July 19 was about the battle at 
running back. Last year, then-
senior Karan Higdon and then-
junior Chris Evans dominated 
snaps as expected. And though 
Higdon 
graduated, 
Michigan 
was supposed to have at least 

one veteran running back with 
plenty of snaps under his belt in 
Evans.
Until he was suspended for the 
season.
As a result, the Wolverines 
are left with a wide-open battle 
for one of its most important 
positions. Running an offense 
that relies heavily on run-pass 
options, 
Michigan 
coaches 
understand that without a viable 
threat on the ground, the passing 
game won’t find the success its 
projected to achieve.
But 
Harbaugh 
expressed 
optimism talking about his three 
major candidates, starting with 
sophomore 
Christian 
Turner 
— he appeared in three games 
last season but struggled to stay 
healthy until this summer. 
“Everything is stay healthy 
(with Turner),” Harbaugh said. 
“You know he’s had some bad 
luck, he’s had some real bad luck 
with the broken bone in his hand, 
and then an ankle injury and 

then a hamstring in the spring. 
“But at each juncture, it’s 
always been, ‘We’re about to 
play Christian. Christian’s about 
to go in. He’s looked great in 
practice. Here we go,’ and then 
either bad luck or bad timing. But 
he’s looking good right now.”
Harbaugh was also effusive 
for freshman Zach Charbonnet. 
Though 
he 
missed 
spring 
workouts, he’s impressed his 
teammates and coaches with 
his acclimation to college-level 
training. 
“He’s been termed a lot like 
Ben Mason,” Harbaugh said. 
“Strength coaches are saying 
that he’s a stalker, that he stalks 
them. He’s in the weight room all 
the time, living in there. Khaleke 
Hudson mentioned to me that 
of all the guys he’s been most 
impressed with, it’s been Zach 
Charbonnet.”
However, the most experienced 
player that is going to receive 
a bulk of the snaps alongside 

Turner 
and 
Charbonnet 
is 
senior Tru Wilson. He made an 
appearance in every game last 
season, turning 62 attempts into 
364 yards for a whopping 5.9 
yards per carry. Wilson’s biggest 
contributions came down the 
stretch when Higdon needed a 
breather and Evans struggled, 
eventually receiving equivalent 
playing time to the latter.

And though Harbaugh doesn’t 
plan on it, if worse comes to 
worst, he’ll be prepared. 
“I’ve also talked about maybe 
Khaleke Hudson who was a high 
school running back,” Harbaugh 
said as the media laughed. 
“I don’t think it’ll get to that 
because I think we’re in pretty 
good shape at the running back 
position but always a possibility.”

After battling injuries, a healthy Johnson emerging as a team leader

Despite not beginning its regular 
season until November, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team has been 
hard at work in Ann Arbor.
The team is working tirelessly 
to continue to mesh as a unit and is 
looking to break through to the Sweet 
Sixteen after ending its season in the 
Round of 32 in back-to-back NCAA 
Tournaments. 
A major change this season will 
be the losses of center Hallie Thome 
and guard Nicole Munger — both of 
whom graduated. The two served 
as integral figures over the past four 
years, and were the heart and soul of 
the team last season as senior leaders. 
This season, senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson, who figures to slot in as 
the team’s starting shooting guard, is 
more than ready to step up and lead a 
new group of Wolverines. 
“(Nicole) Munger really helped 
me a lot because she knew I was 
eventually gonna be a leader,” 
Johnson said. “So, I kinda went 
under her wing. I asked her a lot of 
questions.”
Along with senior forward Kayla 
Robbins, Johnson will be one of just 
two seniors on this year’s roster. 
Despite suffering two ACL tears 

in three years as well as sustaining 
a hand injury in 2018, Johnson 
continued to remain a vocal figure in 
the locker room. In 2019, Johnson was 
a major impact player for Michigan, 
entering the starting lineup and 
playing at both guard spots to key a 
February run that saw the Wolverines 
go 7-1 — eventually propelling them 
to an NCAA Tournament berth. 
“I think being a leader comes from 
respect,” Johnson said. “And I think 
our team really respects me a lot just 
from where I’ve come from, injuries 
I’ve had, adversity that I’ve (fought) 
through, so I think most of it is the 
respect aspect from the team.”
Unlike last season, Johnson will 
slot into Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico’s starting five right off the bat. 
With her new role as one of the team’s 
primary options, Johnson hopes to 
be a contributor on both ends of the 
floor. 
“I want to be the primary scorer, 
primary 
defender, 
and 
primary 
rebounder,” Johnson said. “I want to 
make sure that Coach Arico can trust 
me in the game at any point.”
As Johnson continues to refine 
her game in Ann Arbor, she has also 
had an opportunity to work with 
and mentor the incoming freshman 
class, 
which 
includes 
guards 
Maddie Nolan and Michelle Sidor 

and center Izabel Varejão. 
“Everything we do we always 
make sure that they have confidence,” 
Johnson said. “Freshman year is 
tough, basketball on and off the court 
is tough, so we make sure that we’re 
always there, make sure they always 
have someone to talk to.”
Johnson said that the team’s 
summer workouts have gone well so 
far, even reporting that their strength 
and conditioning coach had to adjust 
the sprint routines because their 
sprint times were too fast. Sophomore 
point guard Amy Dilk says that the 
competition aspect of the summer 
has brought out the best in the team. 
“We’re pushing each other,” Dilk 
said, “but we’re also having fun with 
it.”
Johnson speaks very highly of 
Michigan’s roster for the upcoming 
season, noting that the team has very 
few holes in its roster. 
“There’s not a weak link on our 
team,” Johnson said. “Everyone is 
kind of the same. Almost the same 
size, same build, same intensity, same 
speed, so it’s not really like a weak 
link.”
With Johnson entering the season 
healthy after a summer of training, 
the team is hoping that it can finally 
get over the hump and make a deep 
tournament run.
