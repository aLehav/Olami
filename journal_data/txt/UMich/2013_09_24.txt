Home of ROTC will
be razed to make
way for new building
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
South Quad Residence Hall
might look a bit rough right now,
but another building on campus
will have it worse.
North Hall, the building that
currently is home to the Univer-
sity's ROTC programming, is set
for demolition, pending approval
by the Board of Regents.
Operations Officer Wayne Doyle
said the building is being torn
down because repairs to the cur-
rent building would be too costly.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the building, locat-
ed on North University Avenue
near the C.C. Little Building and
the Museum of Natural History, is
"more than a little old," University
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said.
North Hall was built between
1899 and 1900 as the Homeopathic
Hospital Building, according to
records from the Bentley Histori-
cal Library. It has housed ROTC
programs since 1940.

Senate Assembly
0 upset about lack of
own members on
search committee
By YARDAIN AMRON
For theDaily
At their meeting at Palmer
Commons Monday, members of
the Senate Assembly expressed
concern that the University's
Board of Regents didn't appoint
any assembly members to the

Presidential Search Advisory
Committee.
The Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs - a
nine-member faculty executive
committee elected by the Sen-
ate Assembly - passed a reso-
lution in February 2012 urging
the regentsto include represen-
tatives from the assembly on
the committee. When members
were announced in July 2013,
no assembly members were
among the names
Over the summer, SACUA
responded with another reso-
lution expressing their "disap-

pointment" with the regents'
decision. Assembly members
expressed a similar sentiment
Monday.
"It doesn't start off in very
good light, given the fact that
there's no representation of
central governance on the
Search Advisory Committee,"
said Prof. John Lehman, the
SACUA secretary. "It sends a
sort of message as to what the
conversations are going to be
about in the interviews."
SACUA member Prof. Scott
Masten said the regents gave
no explanation as to why the

assembly was not included in
the committee.
Monday, University spokes-
man Rick Fitzgerald declined
to comment about why no Sen-
ate Assembly members were
included.
In lieu of representation
on the committee, members
proposed that the assembly
establish a strong channel of
communication with the new
University president from the
onset.
But the window of influence
is apparently small. Lehman,

Hall will be up for approval by the
University's Board of Regents next
month. Therefore, he could pro-
vide only limited information at the
time.
"It's been in development for a
long time," Fitzgerald said. "It's a
project that will try to solve mul-
tiple problems on campus."
Lt. Col. Allana Bryant, a profes-
sor of military science, said ROTC
programs will be relocated in May,
and the building will be torn down
in June. It's not clear where the
ROTC programwillbe held during
construction.
Fitzgerald declined to comment
on the timeline of construction,
but said more information will
become available once the project
is approved.
Nursing junior Meghan Con-
ger, an Army ROTC cadet, said
she spends several hours a week
at North Hall because it's the
meeting place for almost all of her
ROTC activities. She added that
she's disappointed the building
will be taken down, as she thinks
of it as acampus landmark.
"It's a very unique building with
a lot of purpose, and it's a build-
ing that's special to cadets and
midshipmen because it's solely for
ROTC operations," Conger said.
"Not a lot of other students know
about it or can use it."
CAMPUS LIFE
New group
combines
networking
with fitness
Run This Campus
spins off events in
Detroit, Chicago
By CHRISTY SONG
Daily StaffReporter
Is your workout routine get-
ting stale? Give networking out a
chance.
Run This Campus is a new
organization focused on promot-
ing fitness through networking,
or "networking out." Unlike many
athletic and wellness groups,
RTC is focused on collaboration
rather than competition. It also
provides the opportunity for par-
ticipants to engage with commu-
nity leaders, peers and potential
employers.
RTC is based off of an organiza-
tion with operations Detroit and
Chicago called Run This Town,
which was founded in 2012. Usual-
ly 400 to 1,000 people participate
in two sessions a week in those cit-
ies, according to the group's orga-
nizers.
LSA senior Omar Hashwi, for-
mer vice president of the Cen-
tral Student Government, helped
start RTC. The group held its first
meeting on Sept. 17 and will soon
announce inaugural events. Hash-
wi hopes the University's numbers
will reach or surpass the atten-
dance rate of Run This Town.

"My goal is to create a healthier
campus by creating one of the larg-
est collaborative fitness sessions
in the U.S. here at our University,"
Hashwi said.

Oxford Rd. house

The Creators is a new
co-op in town - and it has a
celebritybenefactor.
The co-op was founded
after Business and LSA
senior Nancy Xiao, a mem-
ber of MPowered, spoke at
an alumni event in Cincin-
nati to generate support for
entrepreneurial projects on
campus. Former Michigan
linebacker Dhani Jones, who
currentlyplays forthe Cincin-
nati Bengals, was intrigued by
her speech and approached
her afterward to talk about
creating a student group to
foster such endeavors.
"On this panel, I remem-
ber talking about this prob-
lem we had on campus, that
we're trying to solve, there
was just no one place to go
to meet like-minded people
who were building great
things," Xiao, the co-op's
general manager, said.
Since the event, Jones and
Xiao have worked together to
form a group that encourages
young entrepreneurs to fol-
low through with their dream
projects. Xiao has attracted
six other students to the
cause and they continue to
have weekly discussions with
Jones to continue growing

the outfit.
The co-op is named for its
mission to create a collabora-
tive environment for students.
The co-op is not a part of
the Inter-Cooperative Coun-
cil and is not registered as a
student group. Xiao said they
decided not to affiliate to avoid
narrowing the project's scope.
"It's not a student organi-
zation. We thought it would
be better if we weren't so
Ann Arbor focused ... we
wanted people to be focused
on our people, not the place,"
Xiao said.
This fall, Jones bought the
group a house located at 631
Oxford Road, a property that
used to be owned by the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents.
The four-story house has two
floors of workstations and
communal areas to foster the
exchange of ideas, and a resi-
dential floor for leadership.
Due to zoning laws, only four
members are able to live in-
house currently as they finish
convertingthe building.
The organization will be
accepting their first group
of new members this fall.
While other clubs accept
students with varying levels
of experience, The Creators
will require more business-
focused qualifications when
considering applicants.
"We're looking for ... peo-
ple that have kind of already
hit that epiphany and have
already started building an
app or selling their first prod-
uct," Xiao said.

Man misidentified by media as

Judge gives EPA six months to

NBC and CBS cause
emotional turmoil
for former worker
McLEAN, Va. (AP) - A week
ago, Rollie Chance was working
the phones, worried that some
of his friends at the Washington
Navy Yard may have been killed
in a mass shooting there.
In the middle of that, he
received a call that he thought
was a prank: a news organiza-
tion telling him that he had been
identified as the shooter.
Chance's name was reported
Sept. 16 by two network news
organizations as the shooter in

Advocates make
progress with
waterway 'dead zone'
NEW ORLEANS (AP) -
Environmental advocates in
states along the Mississippi
River have won a round toward
a long-term goal of having feder-
al standards created to regulate
farmland runoff and other pol-
lution blamed for the oxygen-
depleted "dead zone" in the Gulf
of Mexico and problems in other
bodies of water.
In a ruling Friday, U.S. Dis-
trict Judge Jay Zainey in New
Orleans gave the Environmental
Protection Agency six months
to decide whether to set Clean
Water Act standards for nitro-
gen and phosphorous in all
U.S. waterways or explain why
they're not needed. The EPA
describes the nutrients on its
website as "one of America's
most widespread, costly and
challenging environmental
problems," affecting every state.
"If they step up to the plate
and do the right thing, agreeing
to promulgate federal standards
where states have failed, the
impact on waters throughout the
nation could be hugely positive,"
said Ann Alexander, an attor-
ney for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, one of nine
environmental groups including
the Gulf Restoration Network,
the Sierra Club and the Prairie
Rivers Network.
If they do, she said Monday,
one of the first areas to look at
could be the 31 states of the Mis-
sissippi River basin, because the
annual dead zone is "one of the
clearest manifestations of the
severity of the problem."
Every summer, nutrients
feed algae blooms at the river's
mouth. Algae and the protozoa
that eat them die and fall to the
bottom, where their decomposi-
tion uses up oxygen.
That creates an area on the
sea bottom averaging nearly
5,800 square miles - larger
than the state of Connecticut -

where there is too little oxygen
for aquatic life.
"More than 100,000 miles of
rivers and streams, close to 2.5
million acres of lakes, reservoirs
and ponds, and more than 800
square miles of bays and estu-
aries in the United States have
poor water quality because of
nitrogen and phosphorus pollu-
tion," according to EPA. "Addi-
tionally, nutrients can soak into
ground water, which provides
drinking water to millions of
Americans."
Earlier this month, a fed-
eral judge in Virginia upheld
federal and state pollution lim-
its worked out by the EPA, six
states and Washington, D.C., to
improve the health of the Chesa-
peake Bay by more tightly regu-
lating wastewater treatment,
construction along waterways
and agricultural runoff. The
American Farm Bureau, one
of 44 agricultural groups that
asked to join EPA as plaintiffs in
the Louisiana lawsuit, had chal-
lenged the regulations.
Similar issues are driving the
damaging algae blooms in Lake
Erie and threatening other parts
of the Great Lakes, the NRDC
said in a news release.
The environmental groups
are also members of the Missis-
sippi River Collaborative, which
asked EPA in a 2008 petition to
set standards and cleanup plans
for nitrogen and phosphorus
pollution of the river.
An attorney for the agri-
cultural groups, from the U.S.
Poultry & Egg Association, the
National Corn Growers Associa-
tion and the National Pork Pro-
ducers Council to farm bureaus
in 15 states from Louisiana to
Wyoming, said he would ask his
clients if they wanted to com-
ment.
"We're reviewing the ruling.
We have no further comment
at this time," U.S. Department
of Justice attorney Wyn Horn-
buckle wrote in an email.
The department argued for
EPA that setting such rules
would be unnecessarily com-

plex, would take too many peo-
ple and too much time, and that
the agency could more effective-
ly fight water pollution by work-
ing with states to reduce such
pollution from fertilizer, sewage
and storm runoff.
States are indeed working
with the EPA and each other
on the problem, said Garret
Graves, coastal protection chief
for Louisiana, one of 12 states
that joined the EPA as defen-
dants. "The Hypoxia Task Force
is meeting this week in Min-
neapolis to advance nutrient
management strategies on the
entire Mississippi River basin,"
he said.
He said Iowa released its plan
about a year ago. "We're work-
ing in that larger venue to make
sure that all the state efforts are
complementary," Graves said.
The U.S. Supreme Court's
2007 ruling in a lawsuit about
greenhouse gases and car emis-
sions also requires EPA to inves-
tigate whether federal water
pollution standards are needed,
Zainey ruled Friday.
He refused to rule that such
standards should be based only
on science, noting that the Clean
Water Act was designed to give
the states the first crack at set-
ting water quality standards,
letting EPA step in "only when
the states demonstrate that they
either cannot or will not comply.
"Plaintiffs contend that most
states to date have done little
or nothing to meaningfully
control the levels of nitrogen
and phosphorous that pollute
their waters, and that they
have even less political.will to
protect downstream waters,"
he wrote.
Alexander said the feder-
al government has known at
least since the 1990s that the
nutrients are a major problem.
She said EPA warned states in
1998 that it would have to act if
states didn't set their own stan-
dards within three years. "They
extended that deadline and then
ultimately blew through it,"
Alexander said.

Gov. Rick Snyder says he

to privatize food service for the
state's 45,000 prison inmates

Snyder will consider objec-

as unionized prison employees
and others but won't let them
block the process, the governor
 told the Detroit Free Press.
The State Administrative

Colorado flood
death toll rises
A 79-year-old woman whose
house was swept away by the Big
Thompson River was found dead
on the river bank, authorities said
Monday, bringing to eight the
death toll from the massive flood-
ing in Colorado.
As the number of people unac-
counted-for dwindled to six,
Vice President Joe Biden viewed
the devastation from a helicop-
ter before meeting with disaster
workers.
"I promise you, I promise you,
there will be help," Biden said,
trying to mute concerns that
a possible federal government
shutdown could derail relief
efforts.
The latest victim was identi-
fied as Evelyn M. Starner. Lar-
imer County authorities said she
drowned and suffered blunt force
trauma. Starner was previously
listed as missing and presumed
dead. Authorities initially said
she was 80.

the SACUA secretary, said the
president's thinking and agenda
starts to solidify after the first
six to eight months.
Another avenue discussed
was attending the board's
Thursday public forum on the
search.
Masten was less optimistic
that attending the forum would
allow the assembly to impact the
search.
"We get to tell them what
we think is important, but we
don't know if they will weigh
those things - we won't have
anybody who will see the
responses of the candidates,"
he said.
Members also discussed what

they saw as ideal characteristics
of the University's next presi-
dent. Many members said that
the new leader should have an
academic and research back-
ground, with a focus on cre-
ativity. Other members favored
a more corporate background,
citing the unique problems of a
public institution, such as solidi-
fyingstate government funding,
creating new revenue streams
and competing with private
institutions.
Still other members valued
communication and technologi-
cal skills, with an emphasis on
leadership and gravitas.
Prof. George Garcia said the
academic and corporate debate
is closely linked, given the
amount offundingnecessaryfor
research.
"The ultimate mission of the

University is to educate the
students. The second - and
it's a close second - is to do
research," Garcia said. "And
the most important thing that
we put out in the research
arena, are the students that we
train to go out to do research,
not necessarily the research
discoveries."
Garcia added that while
the members have differing
visions of their ideal president,
in the end, the entire Univer-
sity community has the biggest
impact.
"We're not getting a mes-
siah. We're getting a presi-
dent," he said. "The person
needs to be a leader and have
a vision, but it's going to be all
of us working with that per-
son that's going to solve these
problems."

FITNESS
From Page 1
Blanchard said the idea of creat-
ing a networking group based
on wellness came to him while
running with a friend in Detroit,
where he was perplexed that
there were no runners along the
recently renovated waterfront.
Having heard about the group
through Facebook, about 30 peo-
ple came to the first event. That
number rapidly grew to more
than 200 people within the first
few months.
The program soon attracted
guest appearances by promi-
nent local figures, and it went
on to win a Spirit of Detroit
Award in 2012. After the pro-
gram expanded to Chicago,
Blanchard said his next goal
was to reach out to a college
campus. Michigan, his alma
mater, was the first choice.
"We understand the demo-
graphic at Michigan is a bit
different with respect to
there's more younger people
that are excited about fitness,"
Blanchard said. "And they
should be exposed to 'network-
ing out.' "
The ultimate goal of RTC is to
branch out and introduce as many
students to "networking out" as

possible.
"It brings relationships
into a different category, so it
enables students to be in the
network in a different realm,"
Blanchard said. "Which will
help students in more ways
than one - both physically and
professionally."
The program is currently
recruiting University students,
faculty and administrators as well
as professionals from the Ann
Arbor community.
"RTC's networking out ses-
sions provide a venue for aspiring
professionals of all fitness levels
to participate in collaborative fit-
ness sessions," Hashwi said. "As
well as expand their personal,
professional and healthy lifestyle
networks."
The organizers plan on host-
ing their meetings on the Diag
to begin with a pre-workout
session in one, larger group
and then breaking into smaller
groups based on a exercise pref-
erence.
A frequent runner, Public Pol-
icy senior Olivia Thompson said
she thinks it will be a unique way
to get to know professors other
than meeting with them during
office hours.
"It's a cool way for students to
interact with teachers outside of
the classroom," she said.

suspicion of nuclear
activity, U.S. looks at
first talk in 30 years
NEW YORK (AP) - The
Obama administration edged
close to direct, high-level talks
with Iran's new government
on Monday, with Secretary
of State John Kerry slated
to meet his Iranian counter-
part this week and the White
House weighing the risks
and rewards of an encoun-
ter between President Barack
Obama and Iran's president,
Hasan Rouhani.
An Obama-Rouhani
exchange on the sidelines of
the U.N. General Assembly
would mark the first meet-
ing at that high level for the
two nations in more than 30
years. Such talks could sig-
nal a turning point in U.S.-
Iranian relations - but also
could be seen as a premature
endorsement for a new Irani-
an government that has yet to
answer key questions about
the future of its disputed
nuclear program.
Obama advisers said no
meeting was scheduled. But
they added that the U.S.
planned to take advantage
of diplomatic opportunities
while in New York and indi-
cated they were not leaving a
possible encounter between
Obama and Rouhani to
chance.
"I don't think that anything
would happen by happen-
stance on a relationship and
an issue that is this impor-
tant," Ben Rhodes, Obama's
deputy national security
adviser, told reporters travel-
ing with the president to New
York.
The election of Rouhani,
a moderate cleric, has led to
speculation about possible
progress on Iran's nuclear

impasse with the U.S. Particu-
larly intriguing to American
officials are Rouhani's asser-
tions that his government has
"complete authority" in nucle-
ar negotiations. That would
be a marked change from
previous governments and
their relationship with Iran's
Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
The U.S. and its allies have
long suspected that Iran is
trying to produce a nuclear
weapon, though Tehran insists
its nuclear activities are only
for producing energy and for
medical research.
American officials say
Rouhani's change in tone is
driven by the Iranian public's
frustration with crippling
economic sanctions levied by
the U.S. But it is still unclear
whether Iran is willing to take
the steps the U.S. is seeking in
order to ease the sanctions,
including curbing uranium
enrichment and shutting
down the underground Fordo
nuclear facility.
State Department offi-
cials said Kerry would seek
to answer that question on
Thursday when new Iranian
Foreign Minister Mohammad
Javad Zarif joins nuclear talks
between the U.S. and five other
world powers. Zarif's partici-
pation, which was announced
Monday, sets up the first meet-
ing in six years between an
American secretary of state
and an Iranian foreign minis-
ter, though it's unclear wheth-
er the two men will break off
from the group and hold sepa-
rate one-on-one talks.
Catherine Ashton, the
European Union's foreign
policy chief, told reporters
after meeting with Zarif that
she saw "energy and deter-
mination" for talks to move
ahead with the U.S., Russia,
China, Britain, France and
Germany.
On Twitter, the U.S.-edu-
cated Zarif called his meeting

with Ashton "positive," and he
added, "Need new start under
new circumstances."
The prospect of bilateral
talks between Kerry and
Zarif did little to tamp down
speculation about a meeting
between the U.S. and Iranian
presidents, who both arrived
in New York on Monday. The
most obvious opportunity for
a direct exchange appears
to be at a U.N. leaders' lunch
both are scheduled to attend
on Tuesday.
But a lunch meeting would
put Obama in the risky posi-
tion of engaging Rouhani
before knowing what the Ira-
nian leader will say during his
highly anticipated address to
the U.N. General Assembly.
Rouhani is scheduled to speak
late Tuesday afternoon, while
the U.S. president will address
the U.N. in the morning.
No American president has
met with an Iranian leader
since the 1979 Islamic revolu-
tion that led to the ouster of the
pro-American Shah Moham-
mad Reza Pahlavi. However,
U.S. secretaries of state and
Iranian foreign ministers have
had occasional encounters. The
most recent was in 2007, when
Secretary of State Condo-
leezza Rice exchanged pleas-
antries with Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki during a
meeting in Egypt.
Suzanne Maloney, a former
State Department official, said
Obama should be wary of mak-
ing a bold diplomatic gesture
with so much about Rouhani's
intentions still unknown.
Back in Washington, sena-
tors urged Obama to reaffirm
at the U.N. that, despite Rou-
hani's recent overtures, the
U.S. will not accept a nucle-
ar-capable Iran. two separate
letters, top Democrats and
Republicans also called on
the president to make clear
that the U.S. will continue
tough sanctions against Teh-
ran.

Chrysler prepares
to offer some of its
shares to the public
after discussion
DETROIT (AP) - Chrysler
Group is reluctantly preparing
for an initial public offering of
some of its shares.
The automaker is proceeding
with the IPO after it failed to
reach an agreement on the value
of the stock with the retiree
trust that owns it.
Chrysler shares haven't been
publicly traded since 1998,
when the company merged with
Daimler AG. The Auburn Hills,
Mich.-based automaker is now
majority owned by Italian auto-
maker Fiat SpA.
The shares that would be sold
are owned by a United Auto
Workers-run trust that pays
the health care costs for around
130,000 blue-collar Chrysler
retirees. The trust owns a 41.5
percent stake in Chrysler. It will
get all of the proceeds from the
IPO if it goes forward.
Sergio Marchionne, the CEO
of both Fiat and Chrysler, has
made it clear that he wants to
buy up the UAW's share and
combine Fiat and Chrysler. But
the two sides have been unable
to agree on a price. The trust has
set the value of the stake at $4.27
billion, while Fiat says it's worth
$1.75 billion.
At the trust's request, Chrys-
ler filed the IPO paperwork with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission late Monday. But
Chrysler emphasized that the
shares may never be publicly
sold. The two sides could still
reach an agreement on the price
of the shares without an IPO.
"There can be no assurance
that any such offering will be
made or as to the timing of any
offering that is made," the com-
pany said in a statement emailed
to The Associated Press.
Richard Hilgert, a Morning-

star analyst who watches Fiat
and Chrysler, said it's unlikely
that the IPO will ever take place
because it's not in the best inter-
est of either the trust or Fiat.
"This is just the negotiat-
ing dance that they have to go
through to come to an agree-
ment," he said.
Hilgert thinks Fiat will likely
exercise options that it has tobuy
another 16.6 percent of Chrysler
stock, giving it 75.1 of the com-
pany's shares. That leaves 24.9
percent that would be sold to
investors who might have differ-
ent interests from Fiat.
Last year, Fiat sued the trust
in Delaware Chancery Court,
saying a 3.3 percent stake it
wanted to buy was worth $139.7
million. The trust contended the
sharesmwere worth $200 mil-
lion more than that. In July, a
judge refused to set a price and
said the issue would have to go
to trial, a process that could take
several more years.
The trust did not immediate-
ly respond to an email seeking
comment. But it likely calcu-
lated that its shares are growing
in value as Chrysler's sales and
profits improve with the econo-
my.
Chrysler reported its eighth
straight quarterly profit in the
April-June period, with net
income up 16 percent to $507
million. Worldwide sales were
up 10 percent to 643,000 vehi-
cles. Among Chrysler's best sell-
ers is the Ram truck, which has
seen sales surge in the U.S. this
year as contractors and other
small businesses have begun
buying trucks again.
In its filing, the company also
warned that the IPO could hurt
Fiat's alliance with Chrysler.
Fiat owns 58.5 percent of Chrys-
ler.
Chrysler exited the U.S. pub-
lic market 15 years ago, when
Daimler acquired it. But the
combination was a disaster, and
Daimler sold most of Chrysler
to private equity firm Cerberus
Capital Management in 2007.

(Don't) shut it down
Political ultimatums are a poor excuse for politics and governance
n Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill
that would defund the Affordable Care Act - or not pass
a budget, causing a shut down of the federal government.
With the end of the fiscal year coming up on Sept. 30, House Repub-
licans are trying to gain Senate support for stopgap spending bills
that would allow money to keep flowing to federal agencies past the
deadline - but only if Obamacare is scraped from the budget. The
partisan-fueled plan, approved by all nine of Michigan's Republican
representatives, should not receive approval from the Senate. Moti-
vated by political gains, the only beneficiaries to this bill are Repub-
licans seeking re-election by any means necessary this November,
and they do so by keeping uninsured Americans down.

Insuring the future

The GOP plan would attach to a continu-
ing resolution, or a temporary federal budget,
that allows the government to maintain a cer-
tain level of spending while Congress works
out a permanent solution. This particular bill,
proposed by Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), offers
a purely partisan approach to spending - one
which ultimately places political ambition over
good policy. After the House voted yes to the
bill onFriday - split between the partieswith a
230-to-189 vote - House Majority Leader Eric
Cantor (R-Va.) started naming off the House
Democrats running for re-election in red states,
warning them that by not voting to defund the
health-care law, they risk losing their seat. This
approach toward legislatingsuggests that these
representatives are more interested in keeping
their title than governing effectively.
Even Republicans in the Senate recognize
the harm this political theater could bring.
When asked about the possibility of shutting
down the government in an attempt to end
Obamacare, Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) argued
that this political ultimatum was bad politics.
"Let me say that I have heard so much con-
cern about Obamacare, and I have supported
repealing it," Ayotte said. "But I don't think
shutting down the government is productive."

If the plan does go through and the gov-
ernment is indeed shut down - for the first
time since 1996 - the ramifications for Mich-
igan could be detrimental for the state's low-
income residents. Under a shutdown, only the
most "essential" federal employees continue
to work - without pay. The lack of employ-
ees may mean "the flow of federal money to
Michigan will slow to a trickle." The popu-
lation that could be most harmed by this
slowdown are those enrolled in Medicaid,
receiving food stamps and others who rely on
social services.
Saturday, at the Mackinac Republican
Leadership Conference, GOP strategist Karl
Rove said it was time for Republicans to offer
a new solution to the country's health care
problems, rather than just shutting down
Obamacare ad infinitum. "We're really good
at describing what's wrong with Obamacare,"
Rove said. "But there's one thing that we're
lousy at and we need to get better at and that
is describing what we are for." Rove is right.
If Republicans truly want a shot at a suc-
cessful election this November - and more
importantly, offering effective healthcare
to Americans - it's time for a solid plan, not
stopgap politicking.

et's talk about climate
change.
There's an extremely
large and cohe-
sive amount of
scientific data
suggesting that
our planet is
warming at a
faster rate than
ever recorded
in human his- KATE
tory. Globally, LARAMIE
the first decade
of the 21st cen-
tury was the "warmest on record"
with surface temperatures rising
steadily by .14 degrees Fahrenheit
per decade since 1901.
This temperature increase may
seem insignificant, yet our planet is
a delicately balanced ecological sys-
tem that is greatly affected by even
the slightest environmental shift.
The acting administrator of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Kathryn D. Sul-
livan, stated that " ... carbon levels
are climbing, sea levels are rising,
Arctic sea ice is melting, and our
planet as a whole is becoming a
warmer place."
While there will always be skep-
tics who believe that global warming
is a complete hoax, the current con-
troversy among the scientific com-
munity is the human impact have
had on our changing climate and
exactly what we should do about it.
The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change - a group com-
prised of scientists from around
the world - has stated in a draft
of their most recent that "more
than half of the observed increase
in global average surface tempera-
ture" has been caused by human
forces. When discussingthe effects

Should the next University presi-
dent focus on lowering the cost
of attendance? Launching envi-
ronmental sustainability initia-
tives? Being personally accessible
to students? Increasing diversity
on campus? Where should the next
president focus their fundraising
efforts? What can the next president
do to improve the student experi-
ence at the University? What aspects
of the student experience should the
next president preserve? These are
questions the University's Board
of Regents need to answer as they
search for President Mary Sue Cole-
man's successor. Without a student
in the room as the board reviews
candidates, we need to take it upon
ourselves to give them the answers
from outside the room - and we
need to speak loudly.
Atthe Julymeetingofthe Boardof
Regents, the regents announced the
formation of a Presidential Search
Advisory Committee, which is made
up of the eight regents and seven
members of the faculty. The make-
up of this committee represented
a notable departure from the last
search that began in 2001, which had
an advisory committee that included
representatives from the faculty,
staff, Dearborn and Flint campuses
and most importantly, two students.
Many, including myself,
expressed disappointment at the
regents' decision to leave student
representatives off the Search
Advisory Committee. After several

conversations with members of the
Board of Regents over the summer,
it became clear the decision would
not be reversed. This is concerning.
Students are very important
stakeholders in the future of the
University of Michigan - perhaps
the most important stakeholders.
Without students, there is no Uni-
versity. We live here. We learn here.
We will graduate from here and
carry the experiences and memo-
ries from Michigan with us for the
rest of our lives. The next president
will play a pivotal role in shaping
the student experience. If the next
president fails, the University fails.
The Central Student Govern-
ment recognized this, and the Uni-
versity Council - a body made up
of heads of each school's student
governments - voted on Sept. 9 to
form a student committee tasked
with seeking and providing a stu-
dent perspective to the regents and
the Presidential Search Advisory
Committee through the search and
eventual transition process.
This student committee, madeup
of a diverse group of student lead-
ers from some of the largest student
organizations on campus, has been
working diligently to solicit feed-
back from students. The committee
put together a survey, which was
sent out Sept. 18, that will help get
a pulse on what qualities, experi-
ences and values students desire
in the next president. There's still
time to take this survey and make

your voice heard.
Additionally, the Board of Regents
and the Central Student Govern-
ment will be co-hosting a forum
for students to give our input as the
regents search for the next leader
of Michigan. Students will have the
opportunity to give remarks to the
regents on what qualities you seek in
the next president.
From my conversations with
the regents, it's clear they take the
input they get at these forums very
seriously. One remark you make
could sway the discussion in a new
direction as the regents assess the
qualities of finalist candidates. You
can sign up to speak through the
link provided in the e-mail all stu-
dents received from me last week.
Even if you don't want to speak,
your attendance speaks volumes to
the importance the student body
places on this search.
We need a president who will
value the concerns students have.
But the first step in that process
is making sure the regents under-
stand what our concerns are. We
all get to play a key role in selecting
the next president who will shape
the future of Michigan. Let's take
advantage of this opportunity. Let
the regents know just how serious-
ly they need to take our voices. It's
the only way the next leader of the
Leaders and Best can succeed.
Michael Proppe is a Business
senior and CSG president.

Reflecting on the
stumbling Emmys

Annual television
 celebration feels
more like a eulogy
By DREW MARON
For the Daily
 Though it aimed for a dignified
tribute to television's past, the
65th Annual Primetime Emmys
stumbled, thanks to CBS's
notorious overabundance of
commercials and its ruthlessly
monitored schedule. Host Neil
Patrick Harris did his best with
the little time he had, including
a hilarious opening monologue
featuring cameos from past hosts
- including Jimmy Kimmel, Jane
Lynch, Jimmy Fallon and Conan
O'Brien, as well as Golden Globes
hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
- and ending with Kevin Spacey
breaking the fourth wall as his
character Francis Underwood
from "House of Cards."
Big winners of the night
included "Modern Family," which
won its fourth consecutive Emmy
for Outstanding Comedy Series
and "Breaking Bad," which won
its first Emmy for Outstanding
Drama Series. "Bad" creator Vince
Gilligan accepted the award with
the humility expected from one
of the best writers in the medium.
"I thought this was gonna be
'House of Cards,' " Gilligan said,
"or it could've been 'Homeland,'
or it could've been 'Mad Men,' or it
could've been 'Game of Thrones'
or 'Downton Abbey,' could've
been any of 'em, and even some
others who were not nominated in
this golden age of television that
we feel so proud to be a part of."
"Bad" also picked up the award
for Best Supporting Actress in
a Drama, with series star Anna
Gunn getting her just due for
putting up with Skyler White
 haters for the past five seasons.
Huge upsets were seen in
both the Lead and Supporting

Actor Categories for Drama.
"Boardwalk Empire" 's Bobby
Cannavale beat out fan-favorite
Peter Dinklage of "Game of
Thrones," as well as "Homeland"
's Manny Patinkin, Jim Carter
from "Downton Abbey" and
"Breaking Bad" stars Jonathon
Banks and Aaron Paul.
But the biggest upset happened
when Jeff Daniels of "The
Newsroom" won for Lead Actor
in a Drama. Daniels echoed
everyone's reaction with his
acceptance speech: "Well crap, I
didn't expect this." The favorite
was clearly Bryan Cranston,
whose turn as Walter White might
very well be remembered as the
greatest television performance
of all time. Still, Cranston has
three Emmys under his belt and
was grouped in a category with
some of the most memorable
TV actors in recent years. Kevin
Spacey's scheming Congressman
Frank Underwood from "House
of Cards" seemed to be next in line
after Cranston, as well as Damian
Lewis from "Homeland" and Jon
Hamm from "Mad Men," whose
portrayal of ad man Don Draper
has yen to see a golden statue.
Still, Daniels's performance as the
affable but isolated Will McAvoy
is largely ignored by most critics,
as is the HBO show itself. Will
McAvoy's charm and nobility set
him apart from the darker anti-
heroes portrayed by his peers,
something that Emmy voters
seemed to have considered.
Other notable winners
included Julia Louis-Dreyfus
and Tony Hale of "Veep," who
won for Outstanding Lead
Actress and Supporting Actor
in a Comedy, respectively. Big-
name filmmakers like David
Fincher ("House of Cards") and
Steven Soderbergh ("Behind
the Candelabra") also won,
with Fincher making history
as the first Emmy winner for a
show that didn't premiere on

any television network. But the
show's most tender moment came
from the standing ovation given
to television legend Bob Newhart,
who won his first Emmy for
his guest role on "The Big Bang
Theory."
Elton John delivered a
powerful performance dedicated
to the life of Liberace, while
Carrie Underwood gave a solid,
albeit semi-sacrilegious, cover of
"Yesterday" by The Beatles. The
nominees for Best Choreography,
meanwhile, presented an out-of-
place performance inspired by
the nominees, turning the award
show into an awkward episode of
"So You Think You Can Dance."
The most controversial change to
the show, however, was scattering
of memorials throughout the
broadcast, in honor of deceased
television personalities like
James Gandolfini and Cory
Monteith. Trying something
new in showing respect to these
tragically departed icons took
some guts, and their attempt
should be applauded. However,
it made the whole broadcast feel
like an overlong eulogy, not a
celebration.
The rushed and
commercialized broadcast acted
as a prime example of why this
current generation is likelier
to watch something on cable,
Netflix or DVR than slog through
the miserable onslaught of
advertisements and cheese that
has rendered networks like CBS
first in viewers and last in quality.
With shows like "Homeland,"
"House of Cards" and "Breaking
Bad" becoming the standard by
which all television is judged,
the question is whether network
dramas will ever be able to
catch up to their less censored
counterparts, or will network TV
someday have its own memorial
segment when the Emmys are
broadcasted on HBO or Netflix
somewhere down the line.

Jhumpa Lahiri's Lowland'
examines brotherhood

By NATALIE GADBOIS

I have two younger brothers,

giggling roommates, yet crippling

Brothers have been a
cornerstone of literature since
stories were written on papyrus.
The passion, the resentment, the
emotionally charged competition
between brothers has obvious
biblical ties, and authors can't
seem to resist the concept
of people tied by blood and
background, but not necessarily
by love.
In the magnificent "The
Lowland," Jhumpa Lahiri
introduces us to two archetypal
brothers: Udayan, the young,
brash revolutionary, and his
intellectual and reserved older
brother Subhash, living in post-
partition Calcutta. Though the

Do they still not care? Do they

we hope to unpack during
Swedish pop
duo Icona Pop's
sophomore
album, Thia This is...
Is... Icona Pop.
Coming from cona Pop
the nation that Icona Pop
has become
synonymous Atlantic
with cranking
out dance-pop
hits(see: Robyn, Bloodshy & Avant,
Avicii and then Robyn again),
Icona Pop seems destined for
superstardom solely based on its
birth certificates. Unfortunately,
the group needs more than a sheet
of government documentation to
produce a greanpop album, which
may be why This is... consists
primarily of filler tracks only
worthwhile for thrusting college
kids in fraternity basements.
By now, the album's opening
track, "I Love It," has been
heard for months by way of
a variety of platforms (radio,
commercials, on repeat in your
brain for days just because),
and it's no wonder: pulsating
synths, simple, shout-sung
lyrics and an in-your-face
chorus that asserts, "I don't
care / I love it." The world eats
that sort of thing up like free
samples at Costco. Despite
the powerhouse single and
album opener, this also marks
the beginning of the album's
consistent fizzle into dull,
vanilla pop, as well as your own
growing concern of why they're
still yelling at you five tracks
deep. Just so it's clear: The
sing-shouting is a not-so-subtle
theme throughout.
We don't care
about this
album.
Laced with winding synths,
tracks like "All Night" and
"Ready for the Weekend" come
across as typical party songs
no one would be able to discern
against the dubstep menagerie
of a drunk disc jockey's
playlist. While This Is... doesn't
claim to be any more than
a fun pop album and would
clearly be the wrong place
to search for any profound
lyricism, tired pop cliches of
smashing the club and not
sleeping because this party is
paradise force songs like "All
Night" to get displaced among

the thousands of OK dance-pop
songs we hear during our lives
and most likely forget about the
following morning.
"Girlfriend" begins with yet
another pop trope of "Na na nas"
paired with an indiscriminate
beat while they assert that all
they need in this life is "me
and my girlfriend / me and my
girlfriend." The album ends
with "Then We Kiss," a byper-
glossy track which comes off
more as a laundry list of nouns
than actual lyrics: "daylight, to
nighttime, to sunrise, to your
eyes, to my eyes, to your lips, to
my lips, to your hips, to our hips
The album ends abruptly
with what is arguably its
worst song. It leaves listeners
unfulfilled and unsatisfied with
a touch of confused.

Not to say This Is... is without
a few decently catchy tracks.
"In The Stars" provides a
much more laid-back, yet still
danceable alternative to the
pounding, fiber-pop that fills
the rest of the album, while "We
Are the World" builds into the
most well-crafted hit behind
"I Love It." These songs have
what the rest lack: the distinct
and thought-out differences
between each verse, bridge and
chorus, giving you something
different to look forward to and
eventually enjoy. Most of the
album struggles to follow this
method throughout and instead
throws every dance beat and
yell-able lyric out there. In the
end, it seems like Icona Pop still
doesn't care, but unfortunately,
I don't love it.

but the expression of the
argument leaves room to be
desired. It's as though all of
Scahill's research and efforts
to explain the war situation
were done merely to appease a
Hollywood audience. And so the
motive seems shaky. He makes
promises, exposes perturbing
secrets, shares the anger of
real citizens, but only for what
seems to be the purpose of self-
importance.
Regardless of Scahill's
apparent self-indulgence,
"Dirty Wars" provides a
disturbing view into the realm
of secret American war efforts.

when all is said and done and

Has there ever been a time
when the fine arts have been
applauded and awarded on such
a mass scale as film or television?
Have millions of viewers
tuned in to watch painters,
photographers, poets or pianists
accept accolades from peers and
critics?
In short, the answer is
of course not. Fine arts are,
unfortunately, not universal
enough to draw in the
same crowd - not enough
people follow the works of
contemporary artists to have an
award show that could carry as
much weight and authority.
And, regrettably, it makes
sense. The feelingI get after

powerful, it rarely compares to
anything a painting can evoke.
Watching a master violinist

stare transfixed at the artist.
But with albums, film and TV,
the concept is simple: Create
a piece of art that will allow
the viewer or listener to feel
they've experienced the emotion
portrayed. Without that critical
connection, all would be lost.
The reason people enjoy going
to the movies isto understand
characters. Whether through
complex thought, through
dramatic storytelling or through
comedy interlude, the underlying
goal is to achieve mutual
appreciation and recognition
between storyteller and listener.
Plots vary vastly - very few

people watch "Homeland"
because they've been in either
Carrie Mathison's or Nicholas
Brody's shoes. In fact, because
TV is often an escape from
reality, whether or not shows
perfectly complement the
general population's lifestyles is
irrelevant - what matters is the
underlying emotion. Everyone
has felt fear, uncertainty and the
tugging pull of indecision. This
is what draws people in.
It's no wonder audiences
want to celebrate the
amazing performances put
on by people - it's a way of
sayingcongratulations for
acknowledging how real and
complicated human emotion is.
TV gets the
Emmys, film
gets the Oscars,
Picasso gets ... ?
It's not thatthe finer arts are
stagnate and touched out from
daily life. Plenty of contemporary
artistsbeautifully depict reality
through a lens or apaintbrush.
Rather, it's that there is no
exchange of information between
artist andviewer. Sprawling
behemoths, films, TV shows
and albums are thousands of
paintings, photos and violin
performances put into one,
unifying piece of art. It's the
constant movement and flow
of art that allows people of all
backgrounds and experiences to
appreciate and understand it.
Sadly, this truth would leave
any potential fine-art award show
with a small crowd and little
national, widespread coverage.
Fine and visual art don't
hold the same appeal. Whether
photographs can incite fear or
sadness, they're still a snapshot
of an otherwise constantly
changing world. Paintings don't
interact with their viewer. Piano
concertos can't captivate the
same waysangsty lyrics can. In
their own way, the fine arts are
more showpieces - accolades of
their own accord, achieved only
by the craftiest of craftsmen.

Wolverines forced to
earn the right to play

WOMEN S CROSS COUNTRY
For Finn, it's
always been 'M'

By DAVID GRANADIER
For the Daily
It's easy to spot Michigan ath-
letes around campus: uniforms,
jackets and the gear they wear.
But the 148th Michigan baseball
teamhas chosentotake a different
approach.
Michigan coach Erik Bakich
wants his team to earn every-
thing it is given, so he gave each
of his players one $2 white, cotton
T-shirt and one pair of the worst
blue mesh shorts he could find
to work out in. It was their uni-
form until the coaches felt they
deserved everything the school
has to give. They couldn't even go
into the locker room until Bakich
felt the team had earned that right.
"These first couple weeks of
school, part of our training is
instilling the culture we want,
a championship mindset, by
reinforcing how privileged and
fortunate we are to be a part of
Michigan and Michigan athlet-
ics," Bakich said.
For the Wolverines, everybody
is equal. Whatever they earn, they
earn it as a team and not as indi-
viduals.
When Bakich feels that the
team as a whole has performed
well in workouts and practices
over time, they are granted these
privileges.
"It's much bigger than an indi-
vidual player earning a maize
T-shirt," Bakich said. "The team
will all get the gear, the team will
all move into the locker room
together."
Even the coaches, trainers and
faculty take part.
"It's big, too, that all the coach-
es and all the sports staff who are
part of the team wear the exact
same stuff that we do every day,"
said senior catcher Cole Martin.

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Michigan coach Eric Bakich is entering his second season running the show.

"So they're in their same white T,
same blue shorts, and they're right
there with us in the trenches."
After the first couple weeks,
the team was allowed to use the
locker room but is still earning the
privilege to staythere full time. As
of now, it's only a place to change,
like avisitor's locker room.
This is Bakich's second year at
the helm of the team, so this is the
second year the team has adopted
the policy. Many of the players see
the unique tradition as symbolic
of a new era of Michigan baseball
and have gained a new perspective
because of it.
"It definitely helps you appre-
ciate everything because my first
two years here, we kind of got
everything, no questions asked
and last year was the first year
earning the locker room and earn-
ing workout clothes," Martin said.
"It makes you appreciate what
you're getting - not everyone gets

For Michigan, building a pro-
gram goes far beyond the funda-
mentals. The athletes participate
in leadership training twice a
week and "mental toughness
training" once a week. It's all part
of Bakich's plan to create a team
that's strong on and off the dia-
mond.
"It's so much more than hitting,
catching, bunting and fielding,"
Bakich said. "It's all about the
team and instillingcore values."
Even though the purpose of
the identical shirts and shorts is
to make everyone equal, the team
is still finding ways to put its own
personal touch into the routine.
"As we move forward with the
white T-shirts, we're actually
beginning to write on them," Cole
said. "Writing what we believe
in, whether it be 'God, family,
baseball' or 'Team 148,' that gets
us pumped up or our teammates
pumped up. I think that's actually
a really cool thing."

When she was in high school,
Erin Finn looked up to current
Michigan cross country run-
ners Brook Handler and Shan-
non Osika. Now, after setting
a national indoor 5,000-meter
record in 2012 and almost
repeating the feat in 2013, she is
their teammate - and she's off to
a blazingstart as a Wolverine.
Finn, who placed fourth
in her collegiate debut at the
Purdue Invitational on Sept.
13, arrived at Michigan with
a phenomenal cross coun-
try background. As a junior
at West Bloomfield (Mich.)
High School, she took the 2012
national indoor 5,000-meter
title with a time of 16:19.69 after
having kicked the race off with a
blistering 5:07 first mile that was
described as "reckless" by the
runner-up.
Then, in her senior year, she
crossed the same finish line in
16:18.02 in a head-to-head finish
and was announced the win-
ner with a new national record.
But a few minutes later, a voice
boomed over the public-address
system to say that the runner-up
had in fact won by .01 seconds.
"That was very tough to take,"
Finn said. "But it just motivated
me to keep working, and it's still
motivating me now."
That motivation has proved
useful. Before the Wolverines'

Michigan finishes
third at Invitational

By MICHAEL KESSLER
For the Daily
Sophomore Chris O'Neill got
his season off to a sizzling start
at the Wolverine Invitational last
week with a second-place finish.
So how would he top that effort
in the Michigan men's golf team's
second event of the year?
He topped it by not only playing
injured, but also winning in domi-
nating fashion as his tournament-
winning eight-under-par 208 led
the Wolverines to a third-place
finish at the Windon Memorial in
Lake Forest, Ill., on Monday.
O'Neill sprained his ankle in
warmups at the team hotel before
a practice round, yet he showed
no ill effects from the setback.
Playing with a taped-up ankle,
he shot under par in each of the
three rounds and saved his best
for last: a three-under-par, bogey-
less back nine in the final round
Monday that helped catapult
Michigan into the top three after
briefly falling into eighth earlier
inthe day.
The third-place performance
was a marked improvement over
the past two years of participating
in the event, in which the Wolver-
ines failed to crack the top eight.
"(O'Neill) is really mentally
tough, and he manages the course
really well," said Michigan coach
Chris Whitten. "I don't think he
hit it or putt(ed) it the best he's
ever done, but he just knows how
to manage his game, and he keeps
eliminating shots that hurt his
round or that stop momentum.
I think he just hit the best shots
when he had to this week."
Michigan has been a main-
stay in the 16-team event, which
included perennial top 30 pro-
grams like host and first-place
finisher Northwestern, Kent State
and Arkansas this year. O'Neill's
top score continued an impressive
run of individual performances
at the Windon Memorial for
the Wolverines recently, with a
Michigan golfer now winning the

Michigan coach Chris Whitten said his team is "capable of a lot better."

individual title in three of the past
four years.
In addition to O'Neill's strong
performance, fellow sophomore
Brett McIntosh finished in a tie
for third overall with a four-
under-par 212.
"The course played well for
me out there," McIntosh said. "I
just had to stick to my game plan,
and for the most part, I did. There
were a couple shots I wish I had
back, but overall it was great."
Though the season is still in
its early stages, the sophomore
duo of O'Neill and McIntosh has
already established itself as both
the present and future of Michi-
gan men's golf.
"We're both really competi-
tive guys. We definitely push each
other, we definitely talk about it
amongst each other," McIntosh
said. "It's just great that whether
it's in practice or at tournaments,
we're always pushing each other
and the whole team as well."
O'Neill and McIntosh have
provided early-season fireworks
for the Wolverines, but the rest of
the youth-laden roster has yet to
impress. None of the other three

Michigan golfers at the Memo-
rial finished in the top 40, and the
team has just one upperclassman
on the roster. But Whitten isn't
worried, and he feels his team
will only get better as the season
goes on.
"It's not concerning because
I know that the other guys -
including the players at home that
weren't on this trip - are more
than capable of contributing and
playing at a really high level,"
Whitten said. "We just need
really good competition at home
to make it feel like a tournament
when we're in practice, and then
we'll be ready the next time out."
Nonetheless, coming off a
mostly disappointing season
last year in which Michigan fin-
ished 10th at the Big Ten Cham-
pionships, the coaches are very
encouragedbythe team's opening
play this year.
"I think it was a good start,"
Whitten said. "I think we can play
better for sure, but I think Chris
and Brett will keep getting better,
and I knowthat our third through
seventh players ... are capable of a
lot better."

5 things we learned: Connecticut

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
1. The offensive line is not near-
ly ready for the Big Ten. +t
Saturday was the worst per-
formance yet for Michigan's scuf-
fling offensive line. Lesser teams
had dominated Connecticut in the
trenches, yet on Saturday, UConn
controlled the line of scrimmage.
Fifth-year senior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint had his best
game of the year, and even with
that performance, Michigan still
rushed for fewer yards against
UConn than Maryland or Towson
- an FCS team. The Wolverines
rushed for 173 yards. A Big Ten
defense would've dominated the
Michigan run game.
With an ineffective interior
line, runs up the middle went
nowhere, and offensive coordina-

4. The defense isn't the prob-
em.
Was this a dominant showing
for the Michigan defense? Not
exactly.
But the defense still only gave
up 14 points. And apunt thathit off
the leg of freshman wide receiver
Da'Mario Jones essentially gave
away a touchdown to the Huskies.
What's left is a defense that
surrendered just one long scor-
ing drive. Against anyone, that's
enough to get the job done.
More positives for the defense:
the pass rush showed up. Com-
ing into the game, the defensive
line had accounted for only one
sack all season. Three different
linemen had at least half a sack
against UConn. Junior defensive
end Frank Clark finally broke
his drought with two Saturday.
Sophomore Mario Ojemudia and
redshirt freshman Chris Wormley
each had a half sack.
Passes over the heads of the
linebackers is still a concern.
UConn dropped some easy com-
pletions that could've gone for big
gains. And the rush defense gave
up too many easy runs.
But overall - and especially
compared to the offense - the
defense has performed well.

verines averaged just one yard per
attempt on first down.
Yes, Toussaint and the line
were inconsistent on first down.
But the defense didn't have to
respect the pass.
3. Gardner's struggles go
beyond turnovers.
What makes Michigan's recent
struggles so puzzling is that
against Notre Dame, it was a
dynamic and impressive football
team. Akron could've just been a
letdown, but that rarely happens
two games in a row. Michigan
has major holes, specifically on
offense, but are the Wolverines
really as bad as they've shown

againsttwo inferior opponents?
Probably not. Much of that has
to do with turnovers: Michigan
has 12, which is second only to
Western Kentucky (15) for the
most in the nation.
Ten of those are attributable to
Gardner, whose recent swoon is
just as mysterious. Gardner leads
the nation in turnovers with 10,
and many have been the result of
reckless decision-making. That
wasn't exactly the case against
UConn.
Gardner should have been more
careful with the ball on a quarter-
back sneak that resulted ina fum-
ble. Still, the ball came loose after
redshirt freshman lineman Erik
Magnuson was pushed back into
Gardner.
Gardner's first interception was
a result of a poor pass and a tipped
ball. The read wasn't careless, but
the throw was off. The second
pick came on an underthrown ball
into single coverage on a streak.

Redshirt freshman receiver Jehu
Chesson didn't help much to break
up the interception.
The execution was poor, but
a deep shot into single cover-
age isn't ill-advised. on Satur-
day, though, Gardner missed an
alarming number of passes due to
inaccuracy. He finished 11-for-23
for 97 yards through the air.
That's the first time he has
completed less than 50 percent of
his passes as the starter and the
first time he's thrown for fewer,
than 100 yards. During the week,
Borges said Gardner doesn't
repeat his mistakes often. That's
encouraging.
"At least I'm not falling back,
the things he talks about so
much," Gardner said, referring to
Borges's advice.
The problem is, he's found new
errors to make. Gardner's problem
was never his arm. But on Satur-
day, even that failed him.

a

5. Bold Prediction: Brady Hoke
and Co. will shake up the offensive
line in two weeks.

They almost have to. The cur-
rent front five has not shown the
ability to get the job done.
Even prior to the UConn game,
Hoke and Borges said they were
open to replacing some of the inte-
rior line.
"It's always been in pencil,"
Borges said at the time. "We're
going to continue to force people
to compete atthe position. It'sthat
simple. But to say we're going to
start firing guys left and right, no.
We knew if we go through this."
But at this point, what choice
does he have?
