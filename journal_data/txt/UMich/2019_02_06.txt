According to new research, 
the chemical pollutant PFAS — 
or polyfluorolalkyl substances 
— can cause different kinds 
of 
chemical 
mutations 
depending on a person’s race. 
Sung Kyun Park, associate 
professor in the School of 
Public 
Health, 
presented 
this research in a seminar on 
Tuesday sponsored by the 
Integrated Health Sciences 
Core of Michigan Center on 
Lifestage 
Environmental 
Exposures and Disease, or 
M-LEEaD.
PFAS have been used for 
decades in industrial and 
consumer products, such as 

cookware, grease-proof food 
packaging and fire-retardant 
materials. 
Park’s 
research 
highlighted 
two 
different 
forms of PFAS, distinguished 
by their functional groups: 
PFOA 
and 
PFOS. 
PFOA 
and 
PFOS 
have 
different 
manufacturing processes and 
are used in different products.
PFOA 
is 
most 
often 
contracted 
when 
an 
individual’s 
food 
is 
contaminated 
by 
products 
that 
use 
PFOA, 
such 
as 
greaseproof takeout boxes or 
certain kinds of cookware. 
PFOS is more commonly used 
in the auto industry and can 
contaminate drinking water.

In light of the continuing 
Palestinian 
refugee 
crisis, 
leaders from various Arab 
culture 
organizations 
convened 
for 
a 
teach-in 
Tuesday night about the reality 
of life in Lebanese refugee 
camps. 
The 
information 
session was hosted by Learning 
for the Empowerment and 
Advancement of Palestinians, 
an 
educational 
enrichment 
program 
supporting 
Palestinian youth in Lebanon, 
along 
with 
the 
Lebanese 
Student 
Association, 
Arab 
Student 
Association 
and 
Students Allied for Freedom 
and Equality. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Nada 
Eldawy, who is a copy editor 
and Michigan in Color editor 
for The Daily, and Jenna, a 
LEAP volunteer who asked to 
be identified by only her first 
name, led the presentation to a 
group of more than 30 students. 
Since the adoption of United 
Nations Resolution 181, which 
partitioned 
the 
Palestinian 
territory 
into 
Jewish 
and 
Arab states in 1947, around 5 
million refugees qualify for 
aid from the United Nations 
Relief 
and 
Works 
Agency, 
a UN program that assists 
Palestinians displaced by the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. Most of 
these displaced people settle in 
the Israeli-occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. Hostilities 
between Israel and Palestine 

forced about one third of 
Palestinian refugees to live in 
camps in neighboring areas 
such as Lebanon and Jordan. 
According to the UNRWA, 
there 
are 
currently 
more 
than 450,000 refugees living 
in Lebanon. Jenna said the 
UNRWA 
was 
established 
to provide necessary aid to 
Palestinian refugees. Despite 
this, she said the program 
often 
discriminates 
against 
Palestinians and fails to offer 
sustainable solutions to issues 
like power shortages and lack 
of health care. 
“The 
classes 
are 
over-
packed, that’s one of the 

reasons 
that 
the 
UNRWA 
schools fail,” Jenna said. “A lot 
of the kids don’t want to go, a 
lot of them work in the middle 
of the day, and it’s one teacher 
with 50 students. They were 
recently 
criticized 
because 
the kids were not allowed 
to sing the national anthem, 
Fida’i, in the UNRWA schools. 
UNRWA is trying to silence 
the Palestinian identity of the 
Palestinians.”
Last summer, Jenna and 
about 20 others participated 
in LEAP’s Project Shine, a 
program that sends volunteers 
to teach English and other 
recreational activities at the 

Burj Shemali and Rashidieh 
refugee camps in Lebanon. 
The 
program 
emphasizes 
full English immersion in its 
teaching in order to prepare 
Palestinian refugees for their 
high school admissions test, 
which is administered solely in 
English. 
Jenna 
said 
the 
lack 
of 
English 
education 
hurts 
Palestinian refugees’ chance 
of attending high school and 
eventually 
university. 
She 
noted many refugees do not 
attend 
secondary 
schools 
because of the lack of resources 
and opportunity. 

Following the swearing in 
of 48 new members of the 
Michigan Legislature last 
month, a bipartisan coalition 
of 
representatives 
has 
proposed 
a 
constitutional 
amendment to end the state’s 
controversial 
lame 
duck 
session.
In state legislatures, the 
lame duck session is a period 
between the election of new 
representatives 
and 
their 
swearing 
in 
procedures, 
during 
which 
outgoing 
politicians are able to craft 
legislation relatively easily, 
without the fear of public 
scrutiny. Michigan remains 
one of only a handful of 
states in which this session 
still exists.
According to state Rep. 
Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, 
who was a co-sponsor of the 
resolution, Michigan’s strict 
six-year term limits also 
makes the state particularly 
susceptible to facing faulty 
legislation during the lame 
duck period.

Near an isolated desert in 
Patagonia, Argentina, a unique 
community which, in 1980, was 
classified as virtually “extinct,” 
still resides. These descendants of 
South African Boers immigrated 
to Patagonia at the start of the 
20th century and are bilingual, 
speaking both Afrikaans and 
the current dominant language, 
Spanish.
Yet, it seems mostly the older 
generation — those who are in 
their 60s — speak Afrikaans, while 
their children and grandchildren 
have adapted to the prevailing 
language of Spanish as the 
community begins to consolidate 
into modern Argentine society. 
The bulk of those who have 
mastered both of these languages 
have begun to dissipate. 
However, 
for 
Nicholas 
Henriksen, associate professor 
of 
linguistics 
and 
principal 
investigator of the Afrikaans-
Argentine Collaboratory project, 
the distinct and relatively veteran 
community provides insight for a 
contemporary understanding of 
cultural identity.

On 
Tuesday 
afternoon, 
about 20 people gathered in the 
Osterman Common Room for a 
faculty panel on neighborhoods 
and 
suburbs. 
Held 
by 
the 
University of Michigan’s Institute 
for the Humanities as part of the 
“Humanities and Environments” 
series, the event featured three 
University professors, each of 
whom presented their current 
research on topics such as 
poverty, the war on drugs and 
urban neighborhoods.
To begin the event, Alexandra 
Murphy, assistant professor of 
Sociology and faculty affiliate of 
the Population Studies Center, 

drew on her ethnographic work 
in Penn Hills, a suburb outside 
of Pittsburgh, to discuss the 
uniquely suburban ramifications 
of poverty. In particular, she 
focused on how the physical 
landscape of suburbs, originally 
designed 
for 
white 
middle-
class families, exacerbates the 
transportation and social needs 
of the low-income people who 
now live there.
To illustrate her point, Murphy 
used the example of Roslyn, 
a 
woman 
she 
interviewed. 
According to Murphy, Roslyn 
moved 
from 
Pittsburgh 
to 
Penn Hills to escape crime and 
violence and immediately faced 
the stark physical differences 

between city and suburb.
“In the half square-mile that 
surrounded 
her 
(Pittsburgh) 
neighborhood, 
there 
was 
a 
Head Start, fourteen churches, 
an elementary school, a public 
park, a senior center, a Salvation 
Army, four bars, a barbershop, 
three beauty salons, a corner 
convenience 
store 
and 
four 
different bus lines,” Murphy 
said. “In Penn Hills, the only 
neighborhood 
amenities 
that 
were in the same half-mile radius 
within her new (Penn Hills) 
house was one church and one 
golf course.”
According to Murphy, Roslyn 
could not afford a car. Because 
Penn Hills had limited public 
transportation 
and 
few 
sidewalks, Roslyn and others 
who did not own reliable 
cars found they had little 
mobility, 
restricting 
their 
access to resources such as 
stores, 
community 
centers, 
employment opportunities and 
social service centers.
“Those with the greatest 
difficulty getting around in 
Penn Hills, those I’m calling 
homebound, 
are 
acutely 
isolated,” Murphy said. “In 
addition 
to 
mobility, 
the 
physical mold of suburbs also 
has important relations to 
people’s social networks in 
this space. It shapes who they 
know and what ties that they 
have to draw on.”
Matthew Lassiter, professor 
of history and urban and 
regional planning, spoke next 
on the war on drugs in the 
suburbia context from the 
1950s to 1980s. He discussed 
how suburbs were idealized as 
safe utopias, which meant the 
influx of drugs into suburbias 
were seen as crises. According 
to 
Lassiter, 
mainstream 
views characterized ethnic 

minorities as external villains 
who 
were 
invading 
and 
corrupting 
innocent 
white 
Americans from “good” families, 
especially females.
“In the 1950s, there was 
explicit, racist, constant coverage 
of Mexican Americans as a 
crime threat who were invading 
white communities,” Lassiter 
said. “African Americans in this 
time period are actually not 
constructed 
as 
dope-pushers 
crime threat, although they 
would be later … And media often 
showed white females who start 
with marijuana in parked cars 
with their boyfriends, and then 
they end up getting wrapped up 
in these pushers, and then they 
become prostitutes and addicts 
and they’ll never recover.”
In addition, Lassiter focused 
on how attitudes and perceptions 
of drug use varied between 
different identities, leading to 
policy disparity.
“The war on drugs is in part 
about 
the 
impossible 
public 
policy of criminalizing the social 
practices of tens of millions of 
white, middle-class Americans 
who are otherwise seen as 
law-abiding citizens,” Lassiter 
said. “And this of course affects 
what the war on drugs looked 
like in the 1980s. In suburban 
neighborhoods, (there’s) more 
of a public health prevention 
campaign, 
and 
(there’s) 
militarized interdiction in non-
white urban centers.”
To close, Harley Etienne, 
assistant professor of urban 
and regional planning, shared 
his “big questions” about urban 
neighborhoods, 
covering 
topics from inner-ring suburbs 
to 
the 
relationship 
between 
poor neighborhoods and their 
education 
systems.

ON THE DAILY: DPSS ANNOUNCES UNIVERSITY TO GET ICED, AGAIN

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: SNR STUDENTS RALLY ON 
SHAPIRO’S FRONT LAWN

Early 
Tuesday, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Division of Public Safety 
and 
Security 
released 
a 
winter 
weather 
advisory 
for freezing rain, expected 
from around 1 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
Wednesday. 
The 
freezing 

rain is expected to spread 
into Southeast Michigan late 
Tuesday night, but may shift 
from freezing to normal 
rain sometime Wednesday 
afternoon. 
However, 
there are warnings about 
especially 
hazardous 
and 
slick travel conditions.
According to the National 
Weather Service, freezing 

rain is liquid precipitation 
that 
freezes 
on 
contact 
with 
cold 
surfaces 
with 
cold surfaces within a small 
range of temperatures at 
or below 32 degrees. Often, 
a coating of ice is created 
on roads, walkways, trees 
and powerlines and has the 
potential to be dangerous.
DPSS 
spokeswoman 

Melissa 
Overton 
offered 
safety 
tips 
for 
handling 
the 
potentially 
hazardous 
temperatures. 
Recommendations 
include 
wearing 
shoes 
or 
boots 
with non-slip rubber soles, 
walking slowly with short 
steps and traveling along 
grassy 
edges 
for 
more 
traction. 

Feb. 4, 1983
School 
of 
Natural 
Resources students tied a 
green ribbon around the old 
oak tree in front of University 
President Harold Shapiro’s 
house yesterday to protest 
proposed budget cuts to the 
school. 
More than 150 students 
marched from the Diag to 
Shapiro’s house and chanted 
“save SNR” while the ribbon - 
their symbol of opposition to 
the University’s redirection 
was tied. A few students 
said the tree was actually 
an elm, but no one seemed 

concerned. 
After 
musicians 
played 
songs about SNR, speakers 
praised 
the 
school’s 
programs 
and 
criticized 
the 
University’s 
five-year 
financial redirection 
“Teaching 
is 
being 
sacrificed because teaching 
is not important to Dow 
Chemical,” said LSA senior 
Tom Marx. He urged students 
not to “sit back and watch” 
the redirection process. “Get 
involved,” Marx said. “Rallies 
are not enough.”
During the rally, organizers 
in the crowd tried to get more 

people involved by soliciting 
donations to fund a full-page 
newspaper 
advertisement 
publicizing 
the 
school’s 
plight.
The students said they 
hoped publicity would cause 
the Regents to be sympathetic 
when the budget cut comes 
up at their Feb. 24 meeting 
and said they were pleased 
with the exposure
yesterday’s rally provided. 
“It graduate student Martha 
Tableman. “We filled the 
Diag.”
After the rally, one SNR 
student who asked not to 

be 
identified 
complained 
that many people do not 
understand 
the 
present 
budget reviews. “It’s more 
than just cuts in SNR we’re 
upset about,” he said. “The 
money is not being cut 
because it’s not there. It’s still 
in the budget, but it’s being 
put into other programs.
Rally 
organizer 
Susan 
Denzer agreed, saying the 
reviews are “pitting schools 
against 
each 
other.” 
She 
criticized the lack of student 
input in the review process 
and 
said 
administrators 
should consider alternative

Recession, Etienne highlighted 
Detroit’s housing vacancy issue.
“We can see that there is a 
massive problem with housing 
vacancy in Detroit,” Etienne said. 
“Part of it is where Detroit started 
off, and then we have all these 
other factors like the bankruptcy 
and the tax foreclosure crisis that 
exacerbated the issue.”
According to Etienne, his “big 
questions” all ultimately centered 
on the empowering the use of the 
word “ghetto.”
“All this is actually leading to 
this implicit question, which is, 
‘How do we put all this together 
to reassert the term ‘ghetto’?” 
Etienne said. “The use of the 
word ‘ghetto’ could actually be a 
provocative way to draw attention 
to really oppressive conditions in 
particular neighborhoods. We’ve 
actually morphed into using 
euphemisms … Given declining 
property values, underfunded 
schools, police violence et. cetera 
— can we put all this together and 
come up with a new framework 

and justification for using the 
term ‘ghetto’?”
LSA junior Charde Madoula-
Bey told The Daily after the 
event that Lassiter’s presentation 
struck a chord, as it addressed her 
own interests.
“I wrote a research paper in a 
previous class about how the war 
on drugs was a political agenda 
to eradicate the Black population 
through 
mass 
incarceration,” 
Madoula-Bey 
said. 
“With 
Matthew’s point of view, it was 
really interesting how it kind of 
took away the criminalization of 
African Americans and put it on 
Mexican Americans, which was a 
perspective I was totally unaware 
of.”
However, 
Madoula-Bey 
expressed 
she 
wished 
the 
speakers could have presented 
more on possible solutions to the 
issues they discussed.


 
According 
to 
Park’s 
research, white women are 
more likely to contract PFOA, 
while Black women report the 
highest levels of PFOS.
Park said PFOS is a broader 
societal 
issue 
that 
cannot 
be 
ameliorated 
through 
individual decisions.
“My two cents from my 
studies, we need to better 
understand 
the 
difference 
between PFOA and PFOS,” 
Park said. “… PFOS is more 
related to the environmental 
contamination, 
drinking 
water contamination — that’s 
why you cannot avoid. So 
individual 
recommendation 
doesn’t work. For PFOA it is 
more related to the consumer-
product use. That’s why you 
can recommend them, ‘Don’t 
use or a little less use your 
(container for) fast food’ can 
work. But for PFOS, that should 
be done at the population level 
and at the more regulatory 
level, lowering the standard is 
the critical one.”
PFAS 
are 
released 
into 
the 
environment 
from 
manufacturing 
plants 
and 
contaminate water supplies. 
According to the city of Ann 
Arbor, samples collected from 
the city’s drinking water in 
the fall of 2018 showed a rise 
in PFAS levels since 2016, 
prompting 
responses 
from 
local elected representatives.
Public 
Health 
student 

Andrea Winne, who attended 
Park’s talk, remarked to The 
Daily after the speech that she 
found the levels of PFAS in 
water supplies unsettling.
“It’s kind of scary how much 
PFAS is in our water, especially 
since we don’t know what it 
does,” Winne said.
Though 
Park’s 
research 
highlighted 
a 
correlation 
between race and the kind of 
PFAS contracted, it did not 
track the residential areas 
or neighborhoods in which 
women live specifically. He said 
this information is necessary 
to determine a reason why 
Black women contract PFOS 
more than white women, and 
why the opposite is true with 
PFOA.
Park said Black and Latina 
women are disproportionately 
represented 
in 
lower 
socioeconomic classes, which 
likely 
contributes 
to 
the 
problem.
“I cannot say (for sure), 
because 
we 
don’t 
have 
information on where they 
live,” Park said. “We know the 
study is cities, but we do not 
know where they live, and so 
their residential location really 
close to any contaminate area, 
treatment plant or whatever, 
and that’s why we cannot 
comfortably say, ‘That’s the 
reason why we see Black 
women higher,’ but just in 
general, 
in 
environmental 
disparity 
study, 
but 
more 
social-economic 
data 
of 
populations, higher proportion 
in that group is African-

American 
and 
Hispanic 
population, so that’s why they 
could be at higher risk of this 
PFOS exposure.”
According to Park, PFOS 
is especially relevant in the 
state of Michigan. PFOS can 
be found in surfactants — 
substances that reduce surface 
tension — and are often used 
to protect workers and aid 
manufacturing 
processes. 
This is particularly true to 
auto industries, ubiquitous in 
Michigan.
“Chrome plating industry, 
manufacturing companies all 
around, all this is Michigan, 
because Michigan is a Motown, 
an auto industry,” Park said. 
“There’s 
many 
different 
plating companies and when 
they make this inside the 
car, and this chrome plating 
is very important to protect 
the worker, the surfactant is 
very important to protect the 
worker and the manufacturing 
process. 
They 
need 
some 
type of surfactant, but PFAS 
is the answer, well, we need 
to use different surfactant. 
But the cost matters. That’s 
why they’re very resistant to 
change to something else, but 
in terms of health, we need to 
think about whether PFAS is a 
good option.” 
Park said if the government 
were to mandate a phasing out 
of PFOS and PFOA, industries 
are able to develop something 
else that can serve the same 
function as PFAS.
“One thing I want to point 
out is if you replace, now PFOS 

and PFOA, they phase out ... 
the industry, they’ll develop 
something else,” Park said. 
“Just forcing the industry 
to replace is something we 
need to think about. We need 
to find the right surfactant. 
Otherwise, the health effect 
remains.”
Many of the effects of PFOS 
and PFOA remain unknown. 
Public Health students and 
other 
attendees 
said 
they 
hope to use Park’s seminar to 
advance their own research 
and discover exactly how PFAS 
in its different forms affects 
people’s health.
Public Health student Jarrod 
Eaton is conducting a capstone 
project on PFAS’s relation 
to metabolic syndrome and 
cardiovascular disease. Eaton 
said the seminar presented by 
Park spurred ideas to apply to 
his own project.
“It definitely gave me a 
couple of different things to 
think about for my capstone 
project and how I approach 
things, so overall, I thought it 
was very helpful,” Eaton said. 
“A couple of different topics 
came up about what could 
be confounding, some of the 
different results, which is 
something I definitely will take 
a look at in my own research. 
One thing that I thought about 
today was the issue of exercise 
and maybe seeing how that 
confounds the results. I think 
that’s something interesting 
that I’ll definitely be taking a 
look at.”

“You 
need 
experienced 
people around, but when you 
have a lame duck situation 
like 
this, 
(term 
limits) 
amplify the problem even 
more,” 
Rabhi 
said. 
“You 
have people who have only 
served for one or two terms 
that are already running for 
state Senate. There’s huge 
turnover. You’ll have a lame 
duck cycle where almost half 
the house is not going to be 
accountable to the positions 
they’ve been elected to.”
During 
the 
most 
recent lame duck session, 
Republicans 
in 
control 
of 
Michigan’s 
House 
of 
Representatives rejected a 
minimum wage raise and 
increased the difficulty of 
putting statewide initiatives 
on the ballot, complicating 
planned 
legislation 
for 
Democrats assuming office.
The 
House’s 
newly 
proposed 
resolution, 
House Joint Resolution C, 
would 
amend 
section 
13, 
article IV of the Michigan 
Constitution, calling for the 
state legislature to adjourn 
before 
Election 
Day 
and 
resume 
work 
once 
new 
representatives have assumed 
office. Currently, Michigan 
has a full-time legislature, 
meaning representatives do 
not adjourn, even during 
transitions of power.
In light of this problem, 
Rabhi explains, Democrats 
and Republicans have begun 
to come to a consensus on the 
issue of lame duck sessions. 
According to Rabhi, HJR-C 

has sponsors and supporters 
from both sides of the aisle.
“It’s 
100-percent 
bipartisan,” Rabhi said. “I 
think the co-sponsorship was 
50-50 Dems and Republicans. 
It’s one of those issues that 
a lot of us agree on, and it’s 
just a matter of making sure 
the house leadership on the 
Republican side sees this as a 
priority as well.”
Public Policy junior Katie 
Kelly, 
communications 
director for the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
chapter 
of 
College Democrats, stressed 
Michigan’s lame duck session 
has long been an outlet for 
lobbyists and interest groups 
to 
exert 
disproportionate 
influence on legislation.
“We saw from this last year 
how dangerous lame duck 
sessions can be,” Kelly said. 
“The legislature this time 
around tried to end citizen-
led ballot initiatives as well 
as undermine the authority 
of an incoming governor. I 
think, and the College Dems 
think, that passing the lame 
duck legislation will help the 
state be more transparent 
in its legislature and help 
ease the passage of incoming 
leaders.”
Many on the other side 
of 
the 
aisle, 
including 
University’s 
chapter 
of 
College Republicans, echo 
this sentiment, emphasizing 
the harm lame duck sessions 
can assert on the democratic 
process.
LSA senior Dylan Berger, 
president 
of 
the 
College 
Republicans and a columnist 
for The Daily, said in an 
email interview the push to 

eliminate lame duck sessions 
signifies a step in the right 
direction for Michigan.
“Lame 
duck 
sessions 
allow 
for 
legislation 
to 
be passed with unsavory 
amounts of influence from 
special interests and without 
proper debate of the issues,” 
Berger said. “Michiganders 
deserve better from their 
representatives. 
Doing 
away 
with 
lame 
duck 
sessions here in Michigan 
would be a victory for good 
government.”
While 
a 
number 
of 
Republicans and Democrats 
appear to align on this issue, 
in order for the constitutional 
amendment to be passed, 
the resolution would have 
to be approved by the state 
legislature, placed on the 
ballot and be approved by the 
voters during the next state 
election in November 2020.
Despite 
the 
outward 
agreement on HJR-C, Rusty 
Hills, a professor at the 
Ford School of Public Policy 
and campaign manager for 
former Attorney General Bill 
Schuette, contends getting 
the resolution through the 
state legislature could be a 
complicated task to achieve.
“It’s 
just 
unusual 
for 
anyone 
in 
public 
office 
to give up their powers, 
whether it’s the executive 
branch, the judicial branch 
or the legislative branch,” 
Hills said. “I think this is 
going to be a really tough 
road to hoe. If it did pass and 
get on the ballot, it would 
get 
widespread 
popular 
support, but I’m not so sure 
it’s going to get through the 

legislature.”
Despite the public’s strong 
appetite for reform, according 
to Hills, a large percentage 
of 
representatives 
would 
be unlikely to sacrifice the 
session’s existence. Because 
the lame duck period is one 
in 
which 
legislation 
can 
be advanced en masse, the 
amendment would reshape 
the manner and periods in 
which representatives’ most 
valued bills can be approved.
“Lame duck is a time to 
get a lot of things done,” 
Hills said. “When I worked 
for Governor (John) Engler, 
it was a very productive 
time. We were able to get a 
lot of legislation passed — 
quite a lot of it bipartisan, 
in fact. The fact that some 
legislators 
were 
heading 
out the door did give us the 
opportunity to pick up some 
votes, particularly on long, 
festering 
issues 
that 
had 
defied resolution.”
Despite the possibility of 
opposition ahead, Rabhi, as 
well as the 13 Republican 
and 
11 
other 
Democratic 
co-sponsors of the resolution, 
remain confident HJR-C is a 
necessary measure for the 
people of Michigan.
“It’s something that comes 
up at all the coffee hours 
and constituent events that 
I have,” Rabhi said. “This 
is one of those issues that 
keeps on resurfacing. People 
don’t like lame duck; it’s not 
popular with the voters and 
I agree with them. It’s not 
really acceptable to have 
this period of time where 
accountability 
is 
at 
rock 
bottom.”

Kempster and Jones began their 
keynote presentation by discussing 
what a healthy relationship entails. 
By reflecting on their own relation-
ship, the two stressed how com-
munication, trust, boundaries and 
understanding play into a produc-
tive and loving relationship. 
They then discussed how their 
identities as trans women im-
pacted their relationship and have 
forged how they see their individ-
ual roles within their relationship.
“Us as trans people is a huge part 
of our relationship,” Jones said. “I 
am very comfortable speaking out-
wardly in public, that’s just part of 
how I navigate my gender … Corey 
is a woman with a deeper voice. 
When we’re in public, I know to 
step up in that moment … stepping 
up for our safety is super impor-
tant to me.”
With Valentine’s Day coming 
up, Kempster discussed her con-
flicting views on the holiday. She 
often sees it as socially problem-
atic, but also recognizes it as an op-
portunity to celebrate loved ones.
“So much of Valentine’s Day 
can occasionally be very hurtful,” 
Kempster said. “It ends up being 
very heteronormative. It implies 
that the relationships in your life 
aren’t important if you don’t have 
romantic relationships or your 
romantic dynamics are different 
than what is celebrated in our soci-
ety, but I think we can build better 
views and practices under these 
days. Any day that gives space for 
us to celebrate each other and tell 
someone we love them and share 
how we’re feeling with them is a 
beautiful day.”
During a student panel portion 
of the event, when student couples 
engaged with Jones and Kempster 
on ideas surrounding relation-
ships, LSA Junior Mike Zlonchev-
ich discussed how his girlfriend 
encouraged him to expand who he 
celebrated on Valentine’s Day. 
“She asked me what I was doing 
for my family on Valentine’s Day...I 
had never thought of it that way 

before. Up until that point, it had 
always been about the person you 
are with. Now, I’m planning some-
thing for my brother...It’s for every-
one I love in my life.”
SAPAC volunteer Claire Volk-
ert, an LSA sophomore, told The 
Daily after the talk that the event 
was purposefully held close to Val-
entine’s Day in an effort to open 
up new avenues of discussion sur-
rounding healthy relationships. 
“With the event being around 
Valentine’s Day, we wanted to es-
cape the heteronormative narra-
tive that normally surrounds the 
day, and talk about how all differ-
ent kinds of relationships can be 
healthy,” Volkert said. “We want to 
open up conversations to be more 
inclusive and create an environ-
ment where everyone knows that 
they deserve to have a healthy re-
lationship and can recognize the 
values that go into that kind of re-
lationship.
Kempster concluded the event 
with a reflection on what it means 
to love another. She said to her, 
Valentine’s Day is about more than 
romantic love.
“With the falling in love trope, the 
only harm of it is that we close our-
selves off to all the ways that we’re 
loving people,” Kempster said. “So 
often, we’re taught that there is 
one kind of love that must be el-
evated above all else. Love doesn’t 
always have to be hierarchical … 
The more we can love, the better 
our lives will be.”
LSA sophomore Mikayla Kruse 
discussed how her women’s stud-
ies classes inspired her to learn 
more about couples that fall out-
side of heteronormative labels.
“I’ve only really seen heteronor-
mative couples in day-to-day life, 
so I thought it would be interesting 
to learn what it’s like to be outside 
the gender binary and hetero-
sexual assumptions,” Kruse said. 
“I’ve taken a few women’s studies 
classes, and you learn that people 
are outside of the gender binary 
and most things related to couples 
are aimed at heterosexual couple … 
It was interesting and I wanted to 
learn about what that’s like in real 
life, on a day-to-day basis.”

“LEAP 
was 
initially 
founded in order to bridge the 
gap where there is not really 
a lot of English proficiency in 
Palestinian refugee camps,” 
Jenna said. “That is mainly 
because there is not a lot of 
English-focused 
education, 
and the funds for UNWRA do 
not provide a lot of English 
lessons.”
Jenna 
and 
Eldawy 
discussed a typical week in 
the life of a LEAP volunteer, 
which 
included 
English 
education, art classes, trips 
to Lebanese cultural sites 
and lesson planning. Jenna 
said 
while 
her 
students 
were passionate about their 
future careers, they knew 
Palestinian 
refugees 
are 
barred from working in about 
20 professions and struggle 
to find jobs even if they hold 
advanced degrees. 
“Some days, the (students) 
come in and they’re having a 

bad day and their motivation 
is very low, because all they’re 
thinking is ‘Ok, say I do this, 
and then I take the entrance 
exams and I get a donor to pay 
for my college, I do all of that 
and I don’t even end up getting 
a job,’” Jenna said. 
Eldawy 
said 
the 
decaying 
infrastructure 
in 
many 
Lebanese 
camps 
is 
discouraging 
for 
many 
refugees and makes it difficult 
for them to continue their 
education.
“Over half of the Palestinian 
refugee population in Lebanon 
live inside of the 12 camps,” 
Eldawy said. “This leads to a 
lot of issues like overcrowding, 
poor housing, sewage water 
issues and electric issues. 
We were living outside of the 
camps, directly outside of Burj 
Shemali, and we experienced 
power 
shortages 
hourly 
almost. That was not even 
inside of the camps.”
Jenna 
said 
she 
hoped 
students understood that even 
though 
many 
Palestinians 

in 
the 
Lebanese 
refugee 
camps were born in Lebanon 
and have never seen their 
homeland, they are proud of 
their Palestinian identities. 
“There is a saying: ‘The old 
will die and the young will 
forget,’” Jenna said. “When it 
comes to Palestinian refugees, 
that has never been more 
untrue. A lot of the older 
people there hold on very 
strongly to their memories 
and very strongly to their 
roots and that translates. You 
see how they passed it down to 
their kids and their grandkids, 
because 
their 
grandkids 
were the same people in our 
classrooms 
drawing 
and 
talking about their homeland 
because they know and they 
fully believe they’re going to 
reclaim their homeland one 
day.”
LSA senior Ahmed Alabed 
said 
the 
mistreatment 
of 
Palestinian 
refugees 
was 
shocking, especially because 
both 
Palestinians 
and 
Lebanese identify as Arabs. 

“To see inside of Lebanon 
is so different than inside of 
the West Bank,” Alabed said. 
“It was really surprising to me 
to see how Palestinians were 
treated inside of Lebanon. 
I thought that, ‘Oh, Arabs 
would be there for each other,’ 
but I feel like it’s just as bad as 
in the West Bank.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Maya 
Chamra said hearing about 
the 
Palestinian 
refugee 
crisis from volunteers who 
experienced life in the camps 
first-hand was more powerful 
than learning about it from 
the news or in class. 
“The 
hopelessness 
that 
the Palestinians experience 
because they face so many 
barriers to get out of the 
camps,” Chamra said. “I think 
that’s really important. You 
hear about the struggles that 
they may face, you might read 
about it in the news, but when 
you hear personal experiences, 
you hear it directly and it hits 
a lot closer and you realize the 
gravity of the situation.” 

“This community is surprisingly 
very relatable,” Henriksen said. “A 
lot of the topics they talk about are 
still very relevant to 21st century 
politics. We live in a country 
where identity is really important. 
They have really interesting views 
about race; many people today can 
identify and relate to these stories 
from over a hundred years ago.”
Henriksen’s project is funded 
through 
a 
grant 
from 
the 
Humanities 
Collaboratory, 
a 
research 
initiative 
established 
at the University of Michigan in 
the summer of 2017 that provides 
resources for humanities-specific 
scholars to work on more research-
based projects. The grant gave 
him the opportunity to create the 
“From Africa to Patagonia: Voices 
of Displacement project. Due to 
the complicated nature of the 
community, he realized this was 
not just a linguistics centralized 
study, but one that incorporated a 
wide variety of different humanities 
fields.
“We needed to be able to 
research the community not in just 
linguistic terms but also in terms of 
their racial views, their historical 
views, their views on ethnicity in 
race — as they have a really long 
history with Apartheid,” Henriksen 
said. “So we realized as linguists, we 
weren’t really trained in ways that 
would allow us to approach these 
questions on the human experience. 
So we knew we had to work with 
other collaborators.”
The 
project 
is 
composed 
of 
an 
interdisciplinary 
team 
of 
U-M 
faculty, 
post-doctoral 
students, graduate students and 
undergraduates, totaling about 40 
members altogether. Each of these 
members stem from an array of 
different fields, including history, 
linguistics, literature, anthropology 
and much more. The team has 
visited Patagonia once in 2014 and 
again in 2017, conducting more than 
100 interviews in both Afrikaans 
and Spanish.
Ryan Szpiech, associate professor 
of Spanish, looks more into the 
religious aspect of the relation 
between the Afrikaans’ identity, but 
because of the collaborative project, 
has begun to branch out within his 
own research. Szpiech noted how 
certain values in humanities fields 
tend to limit collaboration.
“In the humanities, we don’t tend 
to work together,” Szpiech said. 

“We read and write by ourselves 
because of the emphasis in the 
humanities on originality and the 
form of an argument when writing 
and researching. In the humanities, 
there is a lot of stress on how elegant 
your rhetoric is and how original 
your ideas are, which really does 
limit itself in terms of collaboration.”
Szpiech said he appreciates 
how this project has allowed 
him to explore disciplines he was 
previously unfamiliar with.
“Co-writing, co-authoring pieces 
together is so stimulating, it has 
pushed us all too start talking about 
things we’re not fully comfortable 
with,” Szpiech said. “That is 
something interesting about the 
collaboratory; it’s not a whole bunch 
of experts that are fully informed 
of their subject. Everyone has 
their area, but we have all sort of 
branched out into new areas to 
try on new things. Because we are 
working together, we feel support 
for each other.”
Similarly, 
Myrna 
Cintron-
Valentin, a doctoral candidate in 
psychology, had to shift her view 
of a “traditional lab” and learn new 
skills like archiving, of which she 
had no previous knowledge.
“I’ve worked in a variety of 
different research labs — coming 
from 
psychology, 
I’ve 
had 
experience with interdisciplinary 
labs before where people from 
different areas breed together 
their knowledge into a project, but 
never quite as I’ve experienced here 
where I feel as if people’s different 
academic 
areas 
of 
experience 
really come together to generate 
new things,” Cintron-Valentin said. 
“From the beginning, everyone was 
deeply involved. It was not just one 
person. All of the faculty members 
and even the student interest have 
been integrated into this one big 
project.”
One of the components of 
the lab is the incorporation of 
more than 25 undergraduate 
students. Henriksen’s aim is to 
combat some of the problems 
faced by the liberal arts in 
higher education, such as the 
decline in enrollment numbers 
in light of rising student debt, 
the 2008 financial crisis and 
the job market. He hopes to 
re-imagine humanities research 
and education within its place 
in 21st-century academia.

S

ince Michigan education 
lobbyist 
Betsy 
Devos’ 

appointment as secretary 

of the Department 
of 
Education, 

the sorry state of 
public education in 
Michigan has been 
well 
documented. 

According 
to 

the 
National 

Assessment 
of 

Education Progress, 
Michigan students 
have seen the lowest 
proficiency growth 
on standardized test scores of 
any state in the country.

Most education reformers 

want to increase education 
spending 
as 
a 
way 
to 

counteract 
these 
trends. 

They point to the fact that 
Michigan ranks 29th in per-
pupil spending, that adjusted 
for inflation, we are spending 
less money per student today 
than we did in 2011, and that 
$4.5 billion directed for public 
schools has instead gone to 
higher education.

While proposals to increase 

spending are well-intentioned, 
convincing the Republican-
led legislature to substantially 
increase education funding 
is difficult. I have seen this 
myself. Last year, I went 
to Lansing to talk to state 
legislators about increasing 
funding for community and 
junior colleges in Michigan. 
Every 
Republican 
I 
spoke 

to dismissed our proposal 
as soon as I explained that 
it 
would 
require 
funding 

increases. 
They 
responded 

asking 
specifically 
what 
I 

would want to take away 
funding from and when I 
offered my suggestions, they 
told me that if there were 
extra funds, fixing the roads 
was their priority.

Since 
state 
legislators 

were not willing to increase 
education funding, I started 
thinking about how the state 
government can invest more 
in students with the money 
already 
appropriated 
and 

quickly 
arrived 
at 
public 

school advertising.

Education 
advertising 

in the United States is big 

business, taking many forms 
— online ads, newspaper ads, 
billboards. Michigan public 

school 
districts 

and public school 
academies that set 
advertising budgets 
play a role, with 
$6.25 million spent 
in 
the 
2017-2018 

school year. There 
are a number of 
egregious examples 
of 
individual 

schools 
spending 

excessive amounts. 

Michigan 
Connections 

Academy spent about $750,000 
on advertising in the 2015-
2016 school year alone, Detroit 
Public Schools spent $100,000 
on the “Students Rise. We All 
Rise.” campaign and National 
Heritage 
Academies 
spent 

approximately 
$375,000 
on 

one ad buy in 2014 in response 
the Detroit Free Press’ report 

on 
charter 
schools. 
These 

expenditures are harmful to 
students and a gross misuse 
of public resources. Public 
school advertising spending 
takes away money that could 
be 
invested 
in 
students. 

Michigan should not let public 
schools 
and 
public 
school 

academies advertise without 
regulation.

The first reason to limit 

school 
advertising 
is 
that 

when some schools increase 
their 
advertising 
budgets, 

other schools are incentivized 
to do so as well, and this makes 
sense. If some schools are 
getting their name out, other 
schools trying to compete for 
students will spend more on 
advertising.

Another reason to limit 

school 
advertising 
is 
that 

parents should be deciding 
where to send their students 
based 
on 
school 
results, 

not 
advertising 
prowess. 

Schools spend on advertising 
because it works, meaning it 
attracts students. But what 
decisions are made should be 
determined by school quality. 
When 
schools 
advertise 

without regulation, parents 
are making decisions with the 
wrong data. The right data 
exists on the Parent Dashboard 
for School Transparency on 
the Michigan School Data 
website.

Additionally, unregulated 

advertising 
hurts 
schools 

that invest in their students. 
According to a member of 
Education 
Trust 
Midwest, 

low-performing 
charter 

schools that spend more on 
advertising are able to attract 
more 
students 
than 
high-

performing schools with low 
advertising budgets. Perhaps 
the schools that spend more on 
advertising are not investing 
in their students, which could 
lead to lower test scores.

School 
advertising 
does 

not help anyone. It encourages 
parents to make bad decisions, 
takes 
money 
away 
from 

classrooms and takes away 
from teacher pay. The solution 
is to set a yearly cap for the 
amount 
of 
public 
school 

district 
and 
public 
school 

academy advertising, based 
on the public school district 
with 
the 
lowest 
projected 

advertising budget. Setting a 
cap for public school spending 
on advertising would equalize 
the 
playing 
field, 
forcing 

schools to invest in students 
and compete for new students 
based on merit.

Instead 
of 
relentlessly 

advocating to a Republican 
legislature deaf to increases 
in 
public 
education 

appropriations, 
education 

advocates 
should 
look 
at 

how the state government 
can ensure that schools are 
investing 
their 
funds 
in 

students.

A message to our peers

O

ur campus has been a 

trying environment for 

many in the last year. 

The divisive national dialogue, 

volatile 
campus 
climate 
and 

the University of Michigan’s 

shortcomings on the University 

of Southern California Race and 

Equity Center report have made 

it difficult to see the University 

as the symbiotic community 

we all hoped it would be. As we 

navigate these times together, 

we wanted to reach out to 

you, our fellow Wolverines, to 

remind you of what lies in the 

core of the University’s ethos: 

You belong here.

Whether you’re new to Ann 

Arbor or are toward the end of 

your Michigan experience, you 

have a right to a welcoming 

campus 
community 
where 

you feel safe, included and 

empowered. 
We 
at 
Central 

Student 
Government 
know 

the University has not always 

succeeded in providing that, 

especially to our students whose 

identities are underrepresented 

or underserved. CSG’s purpose 

is to act as the voice for all 

students, 
conveying 
their 

concerns 
and 
working 
to 

ensure the University upholds 

its commitment to enriching 

the future of all of our peers. 

Recently, the concerns we’ve 

heard have centered around 

our campus’s inclusivity and 

safety, so we wanted to start 

an open discussion about our 

efforts to ensure this campus is 

a welcoming environment for all 

visible and invisible identities.

As 
we 
navigate 
the 

implementation 
of 
the 

University’s 
Diversity, 
Equity 

and Inclusion plan, CSG seeks to 

expand the current administrative 

and academic focus and turn 

toward what many Wolverines 

consider to be the most critical 

element: everyday, peer-to-peer 

interactions. We recognize that 

large, institutional changes are 

critical to ridding ourselves of 

systemic injustice, but we feel 

our Michigan community has 

lost its focus on improving the 

Michigan 
experience 
in 
the 

short term as well. Our peer-to-

peer interactions impact current 

and soon-to-be Wolverines and 

illuminate the experiences and 

struggles of our peers, hopefully 

allowing us to better understand 

our diverse environment.

By 
transforming 
campus 

buzzwords 
such 
as 
DEI, 

inclusivity and diversity into 

more digestible concepts, we 

can initiate a cultural shift 

that 
encourages 
ownership 

and accountability on campus. 

Accordingly, 
the 
executive 

branch of CSG created two 

new 
positions 
this 
past 

summer: an executive diversity 

officer 
and 
an 
external 

relations officer. In addition 

to 
improving 
CSG’s 
internal 

inclusivity, representation and 

accessibility, these two officers 

are 
establishing 
a 
student 

organization 
liaison 
program 

that, among other initiatives, 

will help student organizations 

construct and pursue individual, 

self-created 
Diversity 
and 

Inclusivity plans.

CSG 
hopes 
to 
use 
the 

institutional 
and 
existing 

culture 
surrounding 
student 

organizations as a mechanism 

to improve campus inclusivity. 

As we work to make the campus 

more welcoming and safe, we 

must remember that academic 

and administrative initiatives 

can only go so far. New students 

often join student organizations 

to create a more navigable 

community. It is a disservice to 

students, and to the ideals of the 

University, when students feels 

unwelcome because they do not 

see their identities reflected in 

the organization’s membership. 

The identity barrier serves to 

perpetuate a sense of exclusion. 

We at CSG have seen our 

organization 
suffer 
from 
a 

similar negative feedback loop, 

and as we address our own 

shortcomings, we hope to help 

other 
student 
organizations 

do the same. Accordingly, we 

are proud to introduce our new 

initiative: the Narrative, Equity 

and Transformation plan.

The new NET plan will 

allow 
student 
organizations 

to 
benefit 
from 
reviewing 

their 
recruitment 
strategies, 

reflecting on their leadership 

and membership compositions 

and expanding inclusive social 

event programming. The NET 

plan will help organizations 

reconsider simple logistics like 

meeting 
times 
and 
increase 

general 
awareness 
within 

organizations. The CSG team 

will administer a demographic 

survey 
of 
the 
organization’s 

membership, work with current 

leaders to identify and reduce 

barriers for participation, offer 

inclusive 
programming 
and 

social event options and help 

create multi-year strategic plans.

Though the impact may not 

be immediately apparent, CSG 

believes 
its 
commitment 
to 

promoting inclusive practices 

within student organizations 

will be a worthy investment in 

shifting campus climate and 

culture toward one that is more 

accepting and welcoming of 

diverse identities. Our journey 

will inevitably have obstacles; 

we won’t always get it right, but 

all of us as student leaders must 

lead by example for the students 

in our organizations — and other 

leaders on campus.

We are asking you, our 

peers, to join us in confronting 

the 
issue 
of 
inclusivity 

within our communities at 

the 
University. 
Ensure 
the 

organizations you’re a part 

of opt into CSG’s new liaison 

program and NET plan, and 

hold 
your 
organization’s 

leadership 
accountable 
for 

pursuing inclusive change. It’s 

on all of us to help current and 

rising students commit to the 

cultural change. If we strive 

to be the Leaders and the Best, 

then it is time for a Michigan 

experience open to all.

Government President and Lloyd Lyons

“

Are you guys ready to 
move on?” Looking back, 
it’s an odd thing for me to 

say to a mostly-female physics 
study group. But it wasn’t until 
it was pointed out to me at a 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
training seminar that I began 
to question the ubiquity of 
America’s 
favorite 
second-

person plural pronoun, “You 
guys.” A second-person plural 
pronoun is used to address or 
refer to a group of people you 
are talking to. Basically, it’s the 
plural form of “you.”

“You 
guys” 
has 
been 

criticized 
by 
a 
remarkably 

intersectional audience, from 
California 
tech 
startups 
to 

senior citizens. In 2002, Sherryl 
Kleinman, professor emeritus 
at the University of North 
Carolina, described the term 
as, “a reinforcer of a system in 
which ‘man’ in the abstract and 
men in the flesh are privileged 
over women.” Defenders of “you 
guys” often justify its use by 
stating that it’s usually intended 
and understood to be gender-
neutral when used to address 
people. “Guys” in this case has 
been bleached.

In other words, because it 

is seen as gender-neutral in 
this usage, it has lost part of its 
original gendered meaning. But 
does bleaching “you guys” make 
it unproblematic?

When I was growing up, 

similar logic was used to explain, 
if not defend, the use of “gay” as 
a pejorative (e.g. “those shoes 
are gay”). In 2008, a compiler 
of a slang dictionary told the 
BBC that “gay” has “nothing 
at all to do with hostility to 
homosexuals,” and that it was 
“nearly always used in contexts 
where 
sexual 
orientation 

and sexuality are completely 
irrelevant.” This is a technically 
correct description of how the 
term is used as a pejorative, 
but the distinction did little to 
assuage my feelings of isolation 

as a bisexual teenager. It was 
effectively impossible for me to 
separate the bleached meaning 
of “gay” from the non-bleached 
meaning, despite being told to 
explicitly and implicitly.

I think the same is true for 

“you guys.” Though “you guys” 
has 
become 
gender-neutral, 

“guys” is decidedly not gender-
neutral in all contexts. As one 
acerbic Twitter user points out: 
“If you think ‘guys’ is gender-
neutral, ask a straight man how 
many guys he’s slept with.” 
So, at least for me, it’s hard to 
divorce the gender-neutral use 
of “you guys” from gendered 
uses of “guys” in general.

Nevertheless, replacing “you 

guys” is still quite difficult 
— after 20 years of saying it, 
it’s hard to avoid slipping it 
in, especially when I’m not 
specifically focusing on avoiding 
it. Part of the reason why “you 
guys” has so much staying 
power is a lack of alternatives. 
English hasn’t had a universal 
second-person plural pronoun 
since we ditched the singular 
“thou,” 
and 
the 
originally 

plural “you” began to be used 
primarily 
as 
the 
singular 

second-person pronoun. Other 
terms are regionally popular in 
the U.S., such as “yins” in urban 
Pennsylvania, “yous/youse” in 
coastal New England, and of 
course, “y’all” in the South and 
elsewhere. Of course, we all 
have perceptions about regional 
dialects which may make it 
difficult to adopt a regional 
term. “You all” has become my 
preferred pronoun instead of 
my native “you guys,” as to me, 
it seems regionally neutral and 
sufficiently warm.

Of course, some may wonder 

why I’m picking this battle 
instead of focusing on more 
important subjects. “You guys” 
does seem pretty innocuous 
in the grand scheme of things. 
But that innocuity is precisely 
what drives people like Sherryl 

Kleinman to label “you guys” as 
the “most insidious” example 
of sexist language. There are 
certainly worse things to call 
women than a “guy,” but these 
worse terms are often policed 
and immediately called out. 
“You guys” isn’t.

Some might also wonder 

why I don’t focus on “actual 
issues” rather than just words. 
But changing the way we use 
language is one of the few 
things that anyone can do to 
combat those “actual issues.” 
I can’t solve the gender wage 
gap by personally implementing 
sweeping policy changes, but I 
can, for instance, stop using “you 
guys” to address my mostly-
female physics study group in 
order to combat attitudes that 
STEM is a male domain.

Changing 
“you 
guys” 
is 

ultimately not as difficult a task 
as it seems. “You guys” has been 
in existence for only 100 years, 
and has been popular for only 
about 50. Furthermore, there’s 
been some demand for more 
gender-inclusive language on the 
University of Michigan campus, 
as Central Student Government 
passed a resolution last year 
encouraging the use of more 
inclusive terms. And language 
change can happen in relatively 
short periods. Back when my 
parents were in college, “he” was 
prescribed by many sources as 
the most acceptable pronoun to 
use when referring to someone 
of indeterminate gender (“the 
male embraces the female,” don’t 
you know?). That’s changed. 
Perhaps 30 years from now, the 
defenses of “you guys” will be 
seen as equally quaint, perhaps 
not. But, in any case, I’m ready to 
move on.

Much 
like 
seeing 
a 
groundhog on Groundhog Day, 
celebrity sightings at Sundance 
are often serendipitous. You 
have to be in the right place at 
the right time in order to even 
steal a quick glance, but the 
most obvious route to take in 
spotting some movie stars is 
going to a panel discussion. On 
day five of the festival, I had the 
pleasure of watching a loose, 
funny 
conversation 
between 
Jenny Slate (“Obvious Child”) 
and Ed Helms (“The Office”), 
moderated by New York Times 
pop culture commentator Kyle 
Buchanan. 
Some 
questions 
revolved around the Sundance 
premieres of their new films — 
Slate with “The Sunlit Night” 
and Helms with “Corporate 

Animals” — but the two comedic 
actors also shared some lovely 
anecdotes about working in the 
same field of entertainment, 
being 
real-life 
friends, 
the 
world of stand-up vs. the world 
of acting, their past experiences 
at Sundance and overcoming 
stage fright.
After the chat, I ventured to 
Atticus, a nearby coffee shop/
bookstore 
hybrid 
on 
Main 
Street, where I spent a few 
hours writing reviews before 
heading to my only screening of 
the day, Minhal Baig’s “Hala.” 
At one point, in walked Tobey 
Maguire (“Spider-Man”), who 
produced this year’s Audience 
Award winner “Brittany Runs 
a Marathon,” as did the rest of 
the main cast: Jillian Bell (“22 
Jump Street”), Lil’ Rel Howery 
(“Get 
Out”) 
and 
Utkarsh 
Ambudkar (“Pitch Perfect”). 
The timing couldn’t have been 

more perfect. And yet, even with 
this pleasant surprise, there’s 
a sense of unease that comes 
with finding some famous folk 
floating around Park City.
By having to juggle their 
status with the films they’re 
promoting 
at 
the 
festival, 
celebrities are probably already 
well aware of the fact that 
their presence is on full blast. 
This is not to say that every 
filmmaker or actor at Sundance 
is closed off from interacting 
with their fans — flocks of 
movie-goers, for example, went 
to congratulate and talk with 
a receptive Baig about “Hala” 
following the post-screening 
Q&A — but there’s a certain 
distance 
that 
comes 
with 
which celebs you see. Perhaps 
it’s just my own insecurity 
with treating celebrities like 
they’re on a pedestal — they’re 
normal people, too! — and 

the overwhelming nature of 
trigger-happy, 
over-friendly 
film enthusiasts. Either way, 
it’s a reminder of how fun and 
strange the blurring between 
the industry and the public can 
be, especially in a setting as 
temporary as Sundance.

‘Hala’:

For a film that should’ve 
been 
groundbreaking 
in 
de-homogenizing the coming-
of-age genre, “Hala” is oddly 
formulaic and dry. Based on 
the acclaimed 2016 short of the 
same 
name, 
writer-director 
Minhal Baig’s underwhelming 
bildungsroman centers on a 
Muslim-American girl named 
Hala (Geraldine Viswanathan, 
“Blockers”), who finds herself 
struggling 
to 
reconcile 
the 
contradictory nature of her 
hyphenated identity.
Hala is a gifted, studious 
writer, often waxing poetic 
through 
narration 
and 
receiving 
encouragement 
from 
her 
attorney 
father 
Zahid (newcomer Hatta Azad 
Khan) 
and 
English 
teacher 
Mr. Lawrence (Gabriel Luna, 
“Temple Grandin”). Her biggest 
obstacle, however, lies within 
the tense relationship with her 
strict, devout mother Eram 
(Purbi Joshi, “Damadamm!”), 
who criticizes Hala for her lack 
of enthusiasm over practicing 
Islam 
and 
spending 
more 
quality time with Zahid.
Despite a promising setup, 
“Hala” 
hits 
many 
of 
the 
predictable 
dramatic 
beats 
and universal conflicts that 
one could find a typical film 
about high school — a fractured 
home life, an uncertain future, 
first crushes, feeling like the 

end of the world could happen 
at 
any 
moment. 
The 
only 
difference is that the story is 
positioned through the lens of 
a Muslim-American teenager, 
which certainly helps “Hala” 
distinguish itself among the 
many 
coming-of-age 
flicks 
revolving around white boys 
that have dominated young 
adult cinema for quite some 
time. “Hala” even includes a 
few thematic echoes of Greta 
Gerwig’s transcendent “Lady 
Bird,” mirroring that film’s 
dysfunctional mother-daughter 
dynamics, unabashed display 
of burgeoning female sexuality 
and spiritual emphasis on the 
meaning of its protagonist’s 
name (Hala means “halo” in 
Arabic).
Unfortunately, 
“Hala” 
is 
nowhere 
near 
as 
nuanced, 
well-written and honest as 
“Lady Bird,” stumbling through 
its tried-and-true plot with 
aggressively 
on-the-nose 
dialogue 
and 
uninteresting, 
dimensionless 
characters. 
Eram is a particularly egregious 
example of a rigid immigrant 
mother stereotype, a depiction 
reminiscent 
of 
Kumail 
Nanjiani’s character’s mother 
in “The Big Sick.” Additionally, 
Hala’s love interest Jesse (Jack 
Kilmer, “Palo Alto”) is vastly 
underwritten, his main traits 
only being that he shares the 
same love for literature and 
skateboarding as Hala. But 
above everything, Hala’s own 
motivations for what she wants 
to do with her life remain 
unclear, despite Viswanathan’s 
versatile, sensitive portrayal.
Her 
desire 
for 
sexual 
and 
personal 
agency 
in 
a 
restrictive home environment 
invites 
slivers 
of 
inspired, 

soulful 
introspection. 
This 
contrast becomes immediately 
transparent in the first two 
scenes of the film, where Hala 
intones 
an 
Islamic 
prayer 
off-screen before the camera 
cuts to her masturbating in 
a bathtub. Henrik Ibsen’s “A 
Doll’s House” also presents 
a neat juxtaposition between 
Hala’s 
inner 
turmoil 
and 
external circumstances, acting 
as both a reading assignment 
for her English class and an 
intriguing, if somewhat lazy 
form of exploring the film’s 
theme of self-sufficiency. But 
during the messy third act, that 
desire reaches an unsettling low 
involving her English teacher, 
which provokes a surprising but 
unearned reversal between her 
parents.
Considering how the story 
is based loosely on Baig’s own 
life experience, it’s somewhat 
exasperating that “Hala” fails 
to convey any new, insightful 
truths about the rocky tidal 
wave 
of 
growing 
up. 
The 
respectable and quite welcome 
normalization 
of 
Hala’s 
storyline is unquestionably a 
start. There’s no mention or 
showcase 
of 
Islamophobia, 
allowing 
the 
audience 
to 
recognize 
Hala’s 
problems 
beyond 
the 
preconceived 
expectations 
of 
what 
it’s 
like to live as an oppressed 
minority in America. In fact, 
the specificity of Hala’s identity 
might 
resonate 
much 
more 
with those who see this film 
as an achievement in fighting 
the 
underrepresentation 
of 
Muslim-American 
women. 
And while “Hala” should be 
celebrated as such, audiences 
deserve a much better fleshed-
out story.

This past Sunday, on a bitterly 
cold Holocaust Memorial Day, 
Roberta 
Grossman’s 
(“Seeing 
Allred”) documentary, “Who Will 
Write Our History” screened in 
350 venues in 55 countries across 
the world. The State Theater 
was one of those participating 
establishments.
“Who Will Write Our 
History” details the brave 
endeavors 
of 
Emanuel 
Ringelblum 
— 
a 
Polish-
Jewish historian — and his 
collaborators who worked 
to compile an historical 
archive in real time of the 
experiences of the Jews 
in 
the 
Warsaw 
Ghetto. 
Together 
with 
over 
60 
others, Ringelblum created 
the Oyneg Shabes Archive. The 
name comes from the Yiddish 
“The joy of the Sabbath,” a way to 
keep the operation under wraps 
and maintain the group’s secrecy. 
The goal of Oyneg Shabes was 
to ensure that the Jews would 
be able to tell their own stories 
and take ownership of their 
narratives. Many of the archival 
material is seemingly ordinary; 
from simple accounts of daily 
life in the ghetto to newspaper 
clippings and photographs. Yet, 
this is exactly what Oyneg Shabes 
wanted to capture: the everyday 
lives of Jews living in the ghetto, 
what they ate, what they felt, what 
they endured.
The documentary takes an 
unconventional form, using a 
combination of archival material, 

talking 
heads 
footage 
and 
re-enacted scenes. The wealth 
of archival footage is astounding 
and disturbing. Much of the 
footage from the Warsaw Ghetto 
depicts starving bodies piled like 
logs along the streets, shells of 
human beings deprived of the 
most basic of human needs. The 
scenes portrayed by the actors 
flow seamlessly into the archival 
footage, but the talking heads feel 
somewhat jarring. Occasionally, 

the 
documentary 
feels 
more 
like an historical drama than a 
documentary. Nevertheless, the 
film is a powerful one, educating 
the masses about crucial players 
in history who have long been 
overlooked.
The film is filled with an 
abundance of poetic narration 
of accounts from the archive. 
For example, Rachel Auerbach, 
a writer and contributor to 
Oyneg Shabes, recalled the pain 
and longing she felt seeing the 
abandoned belongings of those 
deported after the liquidation 
of the ghetto. It is worth noting 
Auerbach, a Jew and a woman, 
faced double the discrimination 
and exclusion from writing. Her 
beautiful prose still drips with 
emotion even in its translation. 

Ringelblum describes the streets 
of the ghetto as looking like 
Hollywood — everywhere you 
looked was covered with stars 
(referring 
to 
the 
armbands 
emblazoned with the Star of David 
that Jews were forced to wear). In 
another entry from Ringelblum, 
embodied by the voice of Adrian 
Brody (“The Pianist”), he asks, 
does the world know our suffering, 
and if they do, why are they silent?
Auerbach was one of the 
three survivors of the 60 
members of Oyneg Shabes. 
She, together with Hersh and 
Bluma 
Wasser, 
uncovered 
two out of three of the 
buried caches of the archive. 
Ringelblum, who was hiding 
in a bunker underneath a 
Polish gardener’s green house 
was discovered and sent to 
a death camp along with his 
wife and twelve-year-old son. 
Hersh Wasser was the only one 
who knew where the archives 
were located. The third cache is 
believed to be buried beneath the 
Chinese Embassy in Warsaw. As 
one young contributor, Dawid 
Graber, noted in his last will and 
testament, “What we were unable 
to cry and shriek out to the world, 
we buried in the ground.”
The film ends by informing 
the audience that in 1999 Poland 
added three works to UNESCO’s 
Memory of the World Register; the 
scientific work of Copernnicus, 
Chopin’s masterpieces and the 
Oyneg Shabes archives.
“Who Will Write Our History” 
asks us to question the perspective 
of history and reminds us that 
political resistance comes in a 
number of ways.

FILM REVIEW

PLAYMOUNT PRODUCTIONS

BECKY PORTMAN
Daily Arts Wrtier

Han Kang opens “The White 
Book” with a list that could have 
been a collection of chapter 
headings:

Swaddling bands

Newborn gown

Salt

Snow

Ice

Moon

Rice

The book is about the color 
white and the objects that embody 
it, but from the beginning we are 
to understand that white is a way 
into an oblique or repressed feeling 
— she writes of “sifting” the white 
words through herself, drawing 
sentences out “like the strange, sad 
shriek the bow draws from a metal 
string.” For the purposes of this 
book, the color white is somewhere 
between a tool and a door. Her 
narrative and thematic goals are 
clear from the start — the book is, 
in part, an extended rumination 
on a miscarriage her mother had 
two years before she was born, the 
child’s face “as white as a crescent-
moon rice cake.”
The book resists classification: 
it’s told in third person, but for 
the most part it seems as though 
the events in the book mirror 
Kang’s life. Kang’s mother had 
the miscarriage described in the 
book, and large parts of it are set 
in snowed-in Warsaw, where 
Kang went after finishing her 
second novel, “Human Acts.” 
This 
heavily 
autobiographical 
work thus assumes some of the 
characteristics of a novel (third 
person, assumption that anything 
can be fictional) for the distance 

fiction offers, but it doesn’t really 
commit to a narrative arc or any 
of the novelistic infrastructure. 
 
The work is instead structured 
into fragments resembling prose 
poems, with varying levels of 
narrative involvement — a sort 
of an incomplete photo album. 
By the time Kang gets going with 
her elliptical task, she’s already 
juggling themes and motifs. The 
brutal history of Warsaw is placed 
next to her mother’s miscarriage 

and her own second-hand trauma 
from the event. White seems like 
it could be a sinew between these 
disparate concerns, or as Kang 
writes, white could be “something 
like white ointment applied to a 
swelling, like gauze laid over a 
wound.”
It’s unclear what Kang sees in 
the color white that makes her 
want to combine it with trauma 
and death. White appears in the 
book fairly invariably as a symbol of 
cleanliness, order, blankness. Fog 
“scrubs” the boundary between 
the sky and the ground, a white bird 
alights on her head and continues 
flying, people killed in the Warsaw 
uprising are reincarnated as white 
butterflies. A few entries in the 
book point to a white-hot zenith 
of pain, but for the most part, 
white is a one-dimensional other 
for suffering and ugliness. At one 
point she writes of a slushy snow 
quickly disappearing, a “whiteness 
that seemed too perfect to be real, 
showing up the shabby figures that 
moved against its canvas.”

A typical entry will be a brief 
burst of anecdote, or else a scene set 
and interwoven with rumination. 
“On cold mornings, that first white 
cloud of escaping breath is proof 
that we are living. Proof of our 
bodies warmth.” For Kang, the 
natural world and the human body 
are co-expressive, and she rarely 
finds any contrivance at all to link 
them. “There is none of us whom 
life regards with any partiality. 
Sleet falls as she walks these 
streets, holding this knowledge 
inside her. Sleet that leaves 
cheeks and eyebrows heavy with 
moisture. Everything passes.” 
Sleet is right next to fate, clouds 
are right next to bodies. It has a 
pleasingly disjunct haiku-esque 
effect at times, but more often 
than not the adjacencies don’t 
quite stick.
“Where the thin sheet of ice 
meets still water, the ducks float 
side by side on its grayish-blue 
surface, necks bowed to drink. 
Before turning back from them, 
she asks herself: Do you want to go 
on? To push forward? Is it worth 
it?” There isn’t a clear association 
between what Kang is describing 
and 
her 
emotional 
state 
— 
something there that is hidden just 
below the language, that isn’t quite 
being conveyed, the gap widening 
into one that can’t be effectively 
bridged by free association.
This discontinuous style is baked 
into the form of the work itself. It’s 
hard to say whether there’s any 
real linearity to the book at all, any 
sense of progression. Kang’s third-
person persona simply wanders 
around in the same white space 
for the duration of the book. This 
might be honest to the experience 
of emotional pain, but it also means 
that Kang’s book combines non-
progression with non-specificity 
— the book frequently feels like 
it’s not really communicating 
anything in particular about the 
color white, or about grief.

FOR RENT

Last Tuesday, I was awakened 
from 
my 
mid-afternoon 
nap 
to what sounded like a party 
happening on the second floor. 
When I came down from the frigid 
attic I call my bedroom, I was 
greeted by the most wonderful 
of news: For only the third time 
in 40 years, the University had 
cancelled school, and not just 
for one day, but for two. With my 
schedule already perfectly aligned 
to give me Fridays off, I was now 
looking at an early spring break. 
How did I spend it? Did I catch 
up on all of the work I had? Did I 
finally get around to applying to 
all those internships I had been 
talking about? Well actually, yes 
I did. But before I got around to 
doing all the important things, I 
woke up on Wednesday and spent 
the first four hours watching two 
documentaries I had been hearing 
about that both happened to be on 
the same subject.
Fyre Festival. It has become a 
meme twice over now, once when 
the event originally took place 
and again now that Netflix and 
Hulu have brought it back to the 
forefront of public scrutiny. For 
my part, I had no idea what the 
festival was until I started hearing 
about the Netflix documentary 
last week — maybe that’s just how 
out of touch with social media 
I am. I happened to watch the 
Hulu documentary first because 
the friend I was watching with 
had already seen the Netflix one, 
and I was introduced to Billy 
McFarland, the Fyre Festival, and 
a whole host of con artists, shady 
businessman, unfortunate victims 
and rich Instagram models. As 
the hours went by and I slowly 
became an expert on the biggest 
concert turned train crash in 
modern history, I found myself 
more and more fascinated and 
simultaneously more and more 
confused.
Almost every facet of the Fyre 
Festival boggles my mind. It was 
absurd that people were willing to 
pay tens of thousands (or in some 
cases hundreds of thousands) of 
dollars to go to a concert that didn’t 
exist. Billy McFarland’s entire 
gimmick of using a bigger scheme 
to pay off his last scheme. The 
bizarre timing of both Hulu and 
Netflix releasing documentaries 
about the Fyre Festival within 
days of each other and the strange 
way in which the documentaries 
almost feel like two halves of a 
single whole. All of this stuns me. 

I’m just waiting for some third 
party to come along and tell us the 
meta-story of Hulu and Netflix’s 
competing desire to cover this 
purely 21st century debacle. How 
could both companies possibly be 
making a movie about the exact 
same thing and then release 
them at the exact same time? Did 
they plan that? Is this some new 
kind of corporate synergy? And 
what are we to make of the fact 
that Hulu paid McFarland for his 

appearance, but Netflix’s doc was 
produced by Jerry Media, the 
same company that promoted the 
Fyre Fest to begin with?
One 
of 
my 
roommates 
became annoyed with the Hulu 
documentary because he thought 
it 
was 
attacking 
millennials 
unnecessarily. The Hulu doc does 
argue that millennial culture and 
the pretend world of Instagram 
are things that make possible a 
world where something like the 
Fyre Festival can exist. But the 
Hulu doc also went to a place that I 
found even harder to understand: 
It argued that in today’s society 
anyone who isn’t on twitter or 
Instagram in essence does not 
exist. The film actually doesn’t 
argue this so much as it states it 
as a fact of the digital age. At first 
I found this to be a preposterous 
assumption. I hardly ever tweet 
and surely I exist. Surely even 
if no one in my house so much 
as exited the front door on that 
frostbite inducing day we would 
still exist. To think otherwise 
would be to give ourselves over 
entirely to a digital world where 
all that matters is perception 
and reality is meaningless. Or 
in this digital framework, has 
perception become reality? We 
do, after all, live in a world where 
it is increasingly obvious that 
politicians do not have to say 

anything resembling the truth in 
order to get elected and where our 
executive branch treats the truth 
with such a lack of regard as to 
render it almost meaningless. If I 
do not post a picture on a beach, 
did I really go on vacation? If a 
tree falls in the forest and no one is 
there to hear it, did it really make 
a sound?
Although my roommate was 
disturbed by the notion that 
millennial culture caused the Fyre 
Festival and that he didn’t exist 
because he wasn’t on Instagram, 
a few days later I brought up the 
subject at a club meeting and half 
the room agreed that if you are not 
a prevalent person on social media 
you basically do not exist. This 
shocked me. Again I reiterated 
that I was sitting right in front 
of them, I was speaking in the 
room, they were hearing me, and 
this alone was proof that I exist. 
They assured me that, no, in fact, 
I did not exist. They admitted that 
they probably didn’t exist either 
and that even if they posted on 
Instagram right than and there 
if the algorithm didn’t push their 
post to the front of people’s feeds 
it wouldn’t functionally be in 
existence, for how can the post 
exist if no one has liked it? This 
line of reasoning seems dangerous 
to me. Every person is the center of 
their own universe, the key factor 
in their own continued existence.
There are people on this 
campus I have never spoken to. To 
me, perhaps they do not exist. But 
that does not mean they are not 
there. Collectively, the anonymous 
figures I walk past on campus 
have an impact on me, but more 
importantly they have an impact 
on themselves. You do not need 
the outside world to tell you your 
life is worthwhile. Is the support 
and love of your friends and family 
not enough? Is it not enough to 
sit inside on a snow day and text 
no one, post nowhere, call not a 
soul, and enjoy a calm peaceful 
day with your roommates and 
a Netflix documentary? Maybe 
not. But if watching four hours 
of footage about the Fyre Fest 
has taught me anything, it’s that 
you don’t need to pay $250,000 
to attend a concert and you don’t 
need to post on Instagram in order 
to prove you exist. Just take a look 
in the mirror and sing a song in the 
shower. Descartes said, “I think, 
therefore I am.” In this age of 
Hulu and Instagram, I think I’m 
still inclined to agree with him.

DAILY ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

The fury of Fyre Festival

Prior 
to 
the 
release 
of 
Boogie’s Shady Records debut 
album, it was unclear how 
the 
label’s 
backing 
would 
assist him. After all, Shady 
Records is not exactly known 
for promoting its newly signed 
artists or giving them creative 
freedom; just look at the label 
debuts 
from 
Conway 
and 
Yelawolf. It’s clear that Yelawolf 
had little creative 
control over his 
own project, and 
Conway’s mixtape, 
while 
good, 
received virtually 
no promotion and 
generated no buzz. 
However, this was 
not the case for Boogie.
Right out of the gate, it was 
clear that the album came out 
exactly how Boogie imagined. 
“Tired/Reflection,” 
the 
opening track of Everythings 
for Sale, is highlighted by lush, 
soulful 
productions 
littered 
with vocal samples. On the 
song, Boogie questions 
his 
critics and, in turn, himself. He 
ponders their critique and if it’s 
even worth trying to change 
himself as he continues to 
make mistakes. As he reflects, 
a gunshot rings out and the 
beat becomes more intense. 

On the chorus, Boogie raps, 
“(C)ome and save me, I feel 
threatened / Think I ran into a 
dead end, uh / Ain’t no point in 
using weapons, no / I’m at war 
with my reflection, uh,” fully 
explaining 
his 
predicament 
that will carry across the entire 
album.
Boogie is at his best as he 
reflects on his relationships, 
his shortcomings in them and 
his attempts to get better. 
“Swap Meet” is an appreciation 

of Boogie’s girlfriend, stating 
that he is willing to bargain 
everything he has, no matter 
how little he brings to the table, 
in exchange for her love. Album 
highlight “Skydive” finds the 
Compton 
rapper 
pleading 
with his partner to be sure 
of their relationship before 
they 
both 
find 
themselves 
jumping into it too quickly. 
Even the more uptempo songs 
on the album, like “Soho” 
featuring 
JID 
and 
“Rainy 
Days” featuring Eminem, are 
mostly contemplative. “Soho” 
outlines Boogie’s discontent for 

the lifestyle that others expect 
from him. He wants to live his 
own life without having to deal 
with the industry expects from 
him. These songs, as great as 
they are, stick out like a sore 
thumb in an album reliant on 
somber, introspective tracks.
The main problem with this 
album is its pacing. It jumps 
from slow, laidback cuts to 
high tempo songs, even though 
each track delves into similar 
themes. It is a little jarring to 
listen to “Rainy 
Days” 
and 
then, two songs 
later, hear the 
heartbreaking, 
Christian Scott 
aTunde Adjuah-
assisted “Whose 
Fault.” The lack 
of 
sonic 
cohesion 
between 
songs hurts the album a little, 
but by no means does it ruin it.
On 
Everythings 
for 
Sale, 
Boogie manages to find his 
sound and his place in the rap 
scene. Given that he has a great 
ear for beats, all he needs to 
do is fine-tune the synergy 
between his sound and his 
subject matter. With this in 
mind, it is clear that Boogie 
has an incredible album within 
him, but it is a matter of him 
taking his time and realizing 
exactly what it is that he wants 
to accomplish.

Boogie’s latest is the future

Everythings for Sale

Boogie

Shady Records

Robert Smith said that after 
he wrote “Friday I’m In Love,” 
he slipped into a kind of “drug-
fueled paranoia” in which he 
found himself calling everyone 
he knew in the music business, 
panicked because he was sure 
that he had somehow plagiarized 
the chord progression. There was 
an effusive quality to the melody 
that felt too familiar, too easy, too 
obvious to be real, as if the song 
had always existed.
I don’t blame him for being 
paranoid — it’s a perfect song. 
Like really, fully, honest to God 
perfect — the kind of classic I 
can imagine playing softly on the 
last radio on earth after plural 
apocalypses. The world could 
burn, but “Friday I’m In Love” 
would remain and the aliens 
would at least have something 
beautiful to remember us by.
It’s built out of the sort of joy 
that lifts you from your feet, but 
is still suffused with a sweet, 
sad urgency in Smith’s voice that 
pierces through the warmth the 
song’s scaffolding is built on. 
You’ve never once had to think 
about the lyrics to understand 
perfectly what the song is about, 
but if you do think about them 
you’re pulled into a swirling rush 
of love and longing. With every 
verse another week has passed, 
and when you reach the bridge, 
“sleek as a shriek / spinning 
round and round,” you’re brought 
to a new place entirely.
Smith, who was probably best 
known at the time for writing 
moody, gothic pieces notorious 
for their brooding complexity, 
told 
Spin 
Magazine 
in 
an 
interview that he went through 
hundreds of drafts for “Friday’s” 
lyrics, trying to, “...hit something 
that’s not cringing — a simplicity 
and naiveté that communicates. 
There’s a dumbness that sort of 
cracks.”
I’ve 
been 
thinking 
about 
that a lot lately — about art 
that doesn’t exactly articulate 

anything 
complicated 
or 
particularly specific but cracks 
you open anyway, not with a 
blunt force punch of drama or 
pathos, but with the sweet and 
awful earnestness of witnessing 
something unbearably true. It’s 
like this time, a few winters ago, 
I was in the dining hall, freezing 
cold, panicking about something 
that was probably dumb and 
looking over at the table next to 
me where there was a couple. 
They were holding hands and 
staring at each other with an 
open-hearted tenderness all over 
their faces. I had to look away 
almost 
immediately 
because 
it was way too intimate, too 
embarrassing to watch people 
feeling so deeply and so openly. 
There’s a reason we say “I feel 
so attacked right now” — when 
a feeling is precisely rendered, 
its intimacy feels like violent 
intrusion.
I think the art that depicts joy 
the best has a similar effect. It’s 
rare, but I’m finding myself less 
and less interested in anything 
that doesn’t hit this hard, mostly 
because the medium through 
which I discover 99% of the art 
I love — the internet — makes 
me numb. Not in the sense that 
it bores me, but that I think 
it’s done something to me on a 
psychological level that’s difficult 
to define, but feels real anyway.
There’s that scene in “Eighth 
Grade” where Kayla is lying 
in bed, scrolling through her 
phone and we see the changing 
colored lights flashing across 
her face along with a montage 
of all the things she’s seeing — a 
Jimmy Fallon clip, a Tumblr post 
about the bees, a picture of the 
cool girl in class on Instagram, 
a catty tweet, a Trump tweet, a 
steady IV drip of information — 
and it feels so familiar. I’ve been 
Kayla so many times, sitting for 
hours experiencing content with 
nothing really reaching me. My 
attention is captured but my heart 
isn’t and the result is a feeling of 
relentless sameness in the art and 
media I’m consuming day in and 
day out.

Some days just feel like an 
unending feed of content that flits 
by in a listless haze, everything 
blurring together and humming 
at 
the 
same 
frequency, 
an 
inescapable low drone. It leaves 
me uneasy when I look up from my 
computer, like I’m in this liminal 
space between thinking and not 
thinking, feeling and not feeling. 
Bo Burnham said in an interview 
with Rookie: “(The internet) is 
everything. It’s overstimulating, 
it’s 
numbing. 
We’re 
hyper-
connected, we’re super lonely ... 
the problem with the internet is 
indescribably subtle and I just go 
to bed at the end of the night and 
I have a nervous stomach for no 
reason and I don’t know why.”
It’s not that “Friday I’m In 
Love” is the cure (see what I 
did there) to this problem — and 
besides, “problem” is the wrong 
word. I don’t think the Internet 
is a discrete positive or negative 
thing at this point in the culture 
so much so as it operates like 
a lysogenic virus, embedding 
itself into the DNA and growing 
as the host, the user, does. It’s 
only lately I’ve noticed a shift. It 
makes me feel, like Burnham, sick 
to my stomach for reasons I find 
really difficult to explain. I don’t 
know how to fix it. I don’t know 
if it can be fixed, or if it’s all in my 
head, or if something completely 
inscrutable and terrifying really 
has happened to my brain.
But I know I feel a sense of 
relief when I listen to that song, 
or read a book that feels essential 
in that similar feverish way. I 
feel, at this point, so allergic to 
anything ironic or numb in art, 
whether that’s how it’s made or 
how I engage with it. So I’m on 
the hunt for a dumbness that 
cracks me right open, past all the 
bullshit and the soundbites and 
the endless humming monotone 
that fills up my internet, and 
cuts to the feeling. I don’t know 
how often I’ll encounter it, or if 
I’ll be able to tune out the noise 
long enough to pay attention to 
the things that matter. In the 
meantime, I’ll be listening — 
tentatively, carefully.

On loving earnestly, in full

Wednesday, February 6, 2019 — 7A

After two weeks of relief, Mann staying ready for when his number called

One goaltender — the starter 
— leads the team onto the ice. 
The other — his backup — comes 
in the middle of the pack, faces 
half as many shots in warmups 
and spends the whole game on 
the bench.
While that’s the standard 
routine for a starting netminder 
and the backup, the Michigan 
hockey team hasn’t been doing 
things quite like that lately.
In the early part of the 
season, 
junior 
goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne and freshman 
goaltender Strauss Mann split 
time in net. One would start 
on the first night of a series, 
and the other would start the 
second night.
But since the beginning of 
January, Lavigne has been the 
go-to man in goal, starting 
all but a mid-week matchup 
against Merrimack. Against the 
Warriors, Mann got the start, 
largely to allow Lavigne to rest 
as the week was bookended by 
three important Big Ten games.
However, in the Wolverines’ 
last two series, Lavigne hasn’t 
finished the second game of 
either weekend.
On Jan. 26, Lavigne played 
just over 30 minutes and allowed 
five goals to Penn State before 
getting 
pulled. 
Last 
Saturday, 
he played barely 
more 
than 
a 
single 
period 
at 
Minnesota, 
giving up three 
goals 
in 
an 
eventual 
4-3 
loss, 
before 
Michigan coach 
Mel 
Pearson 
elected to switch 
to Mann. 
“I think it’s just a gut thing,” 
Pearson 
said 
of 
making 
a 
goaltender change. “I talk to 
the other coaches about it. 
Sometimes, it’s not that the 
goalie’s playing poorly. Like, 

in Saturday’s case, it wasn’t 
Hayden, but we needed to give 
our team a little bit of a wakeup 
call.”
Pearson is right. It isn’t 
completely 
Lavigne’s 
fault 
that he’s been taken out of 
two straight Saturday night 
games early. The Wolverines’ 
defenders haven’t done their 
job to help Lavigne, especially 
against the Nittany Lions where 
they gave up four one-on-zero 
breakaways.
And 
when 
the 
defenders 
aren’t doing their job, Pearson 
turns to Mann to provide a 
spark and wake up his team.
“It’s a little bit of a wakeup 
call to the other players when 
you pull the goalie out because 
Hayden’s played extremely well 
for our team,” Pearson said on 
Monday. “They know it. Players 
are smart and they understand 
that, 
‘Hey, 
maybe 
we 
left 
Hayden out to dry a little bit. 
(Mann’s) getting in, we better 
pick it up.’ Your goalie going in, 
he has to be ready to provide 
you that spark, too. Strauss has 
done that.”
Mann 
has 
played 
about 
70 minutes across those two 
games. In those 70 minutes, 
he’s allowed only one goal and 
has a save percentage of .966 — 
well above his season average of 
.896.
“He’s 
come 
in 
in 
tough 
situations 
but 
given us chances 
to come back in 
games,” Pearson 
said. “Especially 
Minnesota, 
we were down 
three to nothing. 
Really 
nothing 
on 
Hayden, 
nothing against 
Hayden, we left him out to dry.
“But Strauss came in and 
made some key saves to at least 
get us back tied. He’s looked 
really good. Good for him, 
because it’s hard. It’s hard when 
you’re not playing, but he’s 

stayed in it mentally, which is 
huge.”
Perhaps it’s that wakeup 
call to the defense that has 
allowed Mann such success in 
his appearances. Perhaps it’s 
Michigan recognizing that its 
back is against the wall when 
it gets into a situation where a 
goaltender change is warranted. 
In those two Saturday night 
appearances, Lavigne allowed 
a combined eight goals before 
getting pulled — each time 
leaving the game with the 
Wolverines in a deep deficit.
Or 
perhaps 
it’s 
Mann’s 
dedication to staying mentally 
prepared, even when his playing 
time is inconsistent. 
“Obviously, at any point, 
whether the guy gets hurt or 
pulled, you can get in, so you 
always have to be ready,” Mann 
said. “I think you just kinda 
go through the game, keep 
the bench energy up and help 

your teammates, and when you 
realize there’s maybe a chance 
you might get in, then you start 
kind of moving your legs a little 
bit and start getting your mind 
in the right place in case you get 
in.”
Added Pearson: “Mentally, 
he’s handled it really good. He’s 
been ready. That’s what you 
have to do as a goalie, is you 
have to be ready to go in at any 
time because the goalie could 
get hurt or the coach could call 
upon you to go in and play just 
to change the momentum.”
And change the momentum 
Mann has, particularly against 
the 
Golden 
Gophers. 
He 
entered the game 15 seconds 
into the second period with the 
Wolverines trailing three goals 
to none. By the time the period 
ended, the game was tied at 
three apiece.
But despite that comeback, 
the game ended in a loss and 

became 
Michigan’s 
fourth 
straight split series.
The Wolverines know that 
it’s crunch time. They are out 
of the conversation for the 
NCAA Tournament based on 
regular season record — their 
only path is to 
win the Big Ten 
Tournament. 
There are just 
seven 
regular 
season 
games 
left 
before 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament 
starts 
and 
getting 
home-
ice advantage for 
the first round is 
still in play.
But Michigan hasn’t swept 
a series since late October, and 
the Saturday night difficulties 
certainly aren’t helping that. 
In eight of the nine series the 
Wolverines 
have 
split 
this 

season, they’ve won on Friday 
night and dropped the Saturday 
night matchup. 
“I 
gotta 
look 
at 
that,” 
Pearson said Saturday night in 
Minneapolis. “Hayden’s played 
well, but as a team, we’ve won 
the first game 
mostly 
and 
then the second 
night 
we 
just 
can’t 
complete 
the deal. I don’t 
know what it is.”
The issue of 
why 
Michigan 
can’t 
win 
on 
Saturday 
nights 
doesn’t 
completely 
come down to the goaltender 
situation. But given Mann’s 
mental preparation and his 
performance 
in 
relief 
of 
Lavigne, he may be the key 
to the Wolverines sweeping a 
series or two down the stretch.

Down but not out, ‘M’ retains hope

When the Michigan women’s 
basketball team lost at home to 
No. 23 Michigan State on Jan. 27 
— and fell to 3-6 in the Big Ten — 
it seemed like it was time to look 
toward next season.
With a home matchup against 
No. 13 Iowa — which throttled 
the Wolverines, 75-61, just two 
weeks earlier — looming next 
on its schedule, things were not 
looking good for Michigan. The 
Wolverines could not afford to 
concede a second straight home 
loss and miss another opportunity 
to beat a ranked team if they were 
to maintain any sliver of hope at 
making the NCAA Tournament. 
Considering that Michigan was 
winless on the road in the Big Ten 
and was headed to Madison to take 
on Wisconsin following Friday’s 
game against the Hawkeyes, the 
odds of winning one game, let 
alone both, were slim. 
But what followed was a high 
scoring, hard fought 90-81 victory 
over Iowa and a 76-70 win over 
the Badgers in what was far more 
lopsided than the final score 
shows.
“I think it’s important for us 
not to lose our confidence,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
said following the victory against 
Iowa. “We’ve been in every single 
game, we’ve lost some incredibly 

difficult games. For the most part, 
they’ve all been on the road. So we 
know we’ve had a tough start to 
our Big Ten schedule. We really 
believe in our team. Our losses 
are to some of the top teams in 
the country. We don’t really have 
a bad loss on our schedule, so 
it’s really important to keep our 
confidence.”
And Barnes Arico is right: Six of 
Michigan’s nine losses have come 
against teams currently ranked 
in the AP Top 25. The other three 
losses? All on the road. 
“I think the next step in our 
growth of this team is getting 
wins on the road,” said senior 
guard Nicole Munger. “So that’s 
what we’re focused on moving 
forward.”
Currently sitting at 57 in the 
latest Ratings Percentage Index, 
and as just the fourth team out 
in ESPN.com’s Charlie Creme’s 
latest bracket projection, the 
Wolverines finds themselves in a 
position that just 10 days ago was 
inconceivable.
Even 
though 
things 
are 
trending upwards for Michigan, 
it does not mean in the slightest 
that the Wolverines are a shoo-in 
to make the Tournament.
With seven games remaining — 
including home matchups against 
Indiana and No. 20 Rutgers as 
well as a road contest against the 
Spartans — Michigan will face 
steep competition in this final 

stretch of the season. 
But 
with 
the 
challenging 
matchups comes the opportunity 
for the Wolverines to leave 
their final mark on the selection 
committee. 
Luckily for Michigan, four of its 
remaining games will take place 
at the Crisler Center and the other 
two road games are against two 
of the Big Ten’s bottom feeders: 
Penn State and Illinois.
“I think it’s our fans,” said 
junior guard Akienreh Johnson 
when asked why she thought 
Michigan played better at home 
than on the road. “Just knowing 
that when we’re away and we 
have a bad loss or a bad game and 
knowing we can come home (to 
them), it just makes us happy.” 
For 
the 
Wolverines 
to 
feel 
comfortable 
with 
their 
tournament chances, they will 
have to come out of this stretch 
with, at most, one loss. If it loses 
two games, Michigan will be on 
the bubble sweating it out come 
selection time. 
Anything more than two losses 
and the Wolverines’ only hope at 
making the NCAA Tournament 
will likely be by accomplishing the 
daunting challenge of winning the 
Big Ten Tournament — something 
they have never done in program 
history.
So while Michigan still has its 
work cut out, it’s not yet time to 
count the Wolverines out. 

Three takeaways from fall ball

Michigan softball is back.
After a No. 19 preseason 
ranking, a second straight first-
round loss to Michigan State in 
the NCAA Tournament and the 
graduation of key power hitter 
Tera 
Blanco, 
the 
Michigan 
softball program seems to be at 
a crux. But stirrings of changes 
haven’t fazed the Wolverines, 
who already hit the ground 
running in the fall — fast.
Michigan competed in two 
exhibition series this fall: the 
annual Traverse City College 
Tournament Sept. 29-30 and 
the home-and-home fall series 
in October against the Spartans. 
In Traverse City, the Wolverines 
played Central Michigan, Detroit 
Mercy and Western Michigan 
in a round-robin tournament 
with 
a 
championship 
and 
consolation game. The team also 
scrimmaged Detroit Mercy on 
Oct. 18 in Ann Arbor.
Though the exhibitions, by 
nature, didn’t yield reported 
scores or statistics, fall ball 
provided 
key 
insights 
into 
Michigan’s 
coming 
season. 
These three main takeaways 
from fall ball may be pivotal in 
defining the team’s potential 
this season.
1. The team will bring in a 
third pitcher this season.
Last year, sophomore pitcher 
Meghan Beaubien emerged as a 
star, pitching three individual 
no-hitters 
and 
leading 
the 
nation in wins.
Beaubien 
shared 
primary 
pitching time with Blanco, a 
then-senior. By the end of the 
season, with only two main 
pitching options, Beaubien was 
gassed. She held a 3.99 ERA in 
the last four games compared to 
an overall season ERA of 1.16.
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins’ 
solution? 
Add 
a 
third primary pitcher into the 
rotation.
“We need a really good, 
confident 
pitcher,” 
Hutchins 
said Tuesday at the team’s 
media day. “If we don’t have to 
give Meghan the ball as many 

innings, and you give it to 
somebody else, it forces teams to 
prepare for more than one look 
and it helps keep her fresher 
longer.”
Adding a third viable pitching 
option to supplement Beaubien 
and sophomore pitcher Sara 
Schaefer does just that. And 
freshman 
Alex 
Storako, 
a 
two-time 
Illinois 
All-State 
First Team player, seems to fit 
the role. Storako specializes 
in spin-pitching, in contrast 
to 
Beaubien’s 
more 
power-
driven pitching. Splitting time 
between Beaubien and Storako, 
in 
addition 
to 
Schaefer’s 
contributions, will force teams 
to prepare for diverse pitching 
styles.
“(Beaubien) throws it hard 
and she can bend it, but she 
doesn’t really spin it,” Hutchins 
said. “I like the fact that they’re 
so different.”
After Beaubien sat out of fall 
ball with an injury, Storako got 
time in the circle at the college 
level and is poised to be a strong 
step-up pitcher going into the 
regular season.
“We have our sights set on 
Alex Storako,” Hutchins said. 
“We think she’s going to come 
in and give us some innings — 
some really good innings.”
2. A veteran infield will 
set the team chemistry for 
younger talent.
The 
Wolverines’ 
pitching 
situation may be in flux, but the 
Michigan infield is locked in. 
With junior Madison Uden at 
third base, sophomore Natalia 
Rodriguez at shortstop, senior 
Faith Canfield at second base 
and multiple strong first base 
contenders, infield chemistry 
shouldn’t be a problem.
“It’s really nice having Natalia 
and Faith there cause, you know, 
you already know how they play, 
what their range is, and how 
they honestly play, to the nitty-
gritty of how they throw the ball 
to you,” Uden said. “It’s huge 
because it’s consistent and you 
know what to expect and it just 
makes you that much tighter 
in your defense and that much 
better.”

That chemistry will set an 
example for younger players as 
they integrate into the program. 
Additionally, players hope the 
success and team chemistry 
from fall ball will set a pace 
for the entire team to follow 
during 
the 
regular 
season. 
The games this fall solidified 
the 
upperclassmen, 
and 
subsequently, the team’s, tempo 
heading into the season.
“I think you look to your 
upperclassmen always to set 
the tone and what kind of team 
they’re going to have and what 
kind of standards they’re going 
to hold,” Hutchins said. “My 
upperclassmen and particularly 
my seniors have been really 
rock solid all year, holding high 
standards and showing up to 
work hard every day.”
3. Rankings, former losses 
and impressions won’t affect 
the Wolverines’ play.
Among 
pitching 
changes, 
established 
team 
chemistry 
and freshman integration, the 
biggest takeaway from fall ball 
is that Michigan softball is 
fighting. The Wolverines may 
have received a No. 19 preseason 
ranking. They may bat with a 
traditional 
consistency 
style 
that some teams deem dated. 
They may have suffered early 
tournament exits at the hands of 
in-state rivals. But Michigan has 
built a culture — one that has 
sustained.
“We came out tough against 
Michigan State even though 
it’s just fall ball, and I think we 
really handed it to them,” Uden 
said. “The past few years, it’s 
been a grind for us against them 
in the postseason, but I think we 
came out hot this year and that’s 
how it’s going to continue to be.”
Beaubien 
agrees, 
saying 
that 
rankings 
don’t 
affect 
the team, whose focus is on 
its performance and play — a 
Hutchins philosophy.
“I expect the same thing 
every year,” Hutchins said. “In 
every aspect of our program, 
we are gearing toward a chance 
to be a World Series contender. 
That’s the expectation of our 
program.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“At this time” Chris 
Evans not with team

Junior running back Chris 
Evans is no longer a member 
of the Michigan football team.
“Chris 
Evans 
is 
not 
a 
member of the football team 
at this time,” said associate 
athletic director for football 
communications Dave Ablauf 
in a statement on Tuesday.
Ablauf would not specify the 
reason for Evans’ dismissal, 
citing privacy laws.
Sources told The Daily that 
Evans’ departure is a result 
of academic misconduct, and 
he was disenrolled from one 
of his classes this week. It is 
unclear whether he is still 
enrolled at the University. 
Evans explained his situation 
on Twitter following news 
breaking of his status on the 
team.
“I am going through some 
academic issues right now,” 
Evans tweeted. “I’m working 
through it now. I will still 
continue my career at the 
University of Michigan!”
It remains to be seen whether 
Evans’ dismissal is permanent, 
though Evans writing that he 
will still continue his career at 
the University, as well as the 
statement from Ablauf, seem 

to imply it is not.
“I suppose there’s a chance,” 
a source told the Daily of his 
chances to return. “Basically 
it wasn’t the football team 
that kicked him off it was the 
school. No bad blood between 
Chris and the team.”
Evans totaled 423 yards 
and four rushing touchdowns 
off of 81 carries in his junior 
campaign as the No. 2 back 
behind Karan Higdon. With 
Higdon 
graduating 
and 
declaring for the NFL Draft, 
Evans 
was 
the 
presumed 
starter for the 2019 season.
With Evans no longer on the 
team, as well as the dismissal 
of O’Maury Samuels in early 
December, the running back 
position is murky. Returning 
players with game experience 
include former walk-on Tru 
Wilson, who tallied 62 carries, 
364 yards and a touchdown as 
the No. 3 back, and redshirt 
freshman Christian Turner. 
Incoming freshman Zach 
Charbonnet, who rushed for 
1,770 yards and 13 touchdowns, 
while averaging 8.2 yards per 
carry in his final high school 
season, also appears slated 
to make an impact in his first 
year.

McDaniels will coach 
QBs, Pep Hamilton out

After two seasons as the 
associate 
head 
coach 
and 
passing 
game 
coordinator, 
Pep Hamilton is leaving the 
Michigan 
football 
team, 
according to multiple outlets.
There was speculation this 
move was coming after the 
Wolverines hired Josh Gattis 
to be their new offensive 
coordinator 
earlier 
this 
offseason. 
Since 
Michigan 
didn’t 
have 
a 
specified 
coordinator 
last 
season, 
Gattis’ hiring and presumed 
responsibilities — Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
said 
Gattis will have full control 
of the offense — seemed to 
overlap with Hamilton’s role.
Now, 
with 
Hamilton’s 
departure, 
that 
picture 
is 
clear.
In addition to the Hamilton 
news, Sam Webb of 247Sports 
reported that Ben McDaniels 
will be taking over as the 
Wolverines’ 
quarterbacks 
coach for 2019.
McDaniels is the brother 
of 
New 
England 
Patriots 
offensive 
coordinator 
Josh 
McDaniels, and he has spent 
his career bouncing around 
various 
NFL 
and 
college 
coaching 
staffs, 
including 
spending the last two seasons 
with the Chicago Bears.
Harbaugh 
mentioned 
in 

December that he anticipated 
giving McDaniels a full-time 
role on the coaching staff, 
but at the time it was thought 
to mean he would take over 
as receivers coach for the 
departing 
Jim 
McElwain. 
McDaniels coached receivers 
in the Peach Bowl in an interim 
role after McElwain was hired 
at Central Michigan.
After the hiring of Gattis, 

however, 
McDaniels’ 

upcoming role was unclear, 
as 
Gattis 
has 
extensive 
experience 
coaching 
wide 
receivers.
With 
Hamilton 
gone, 
McDaniels seems like a natural 
fit with the quarterbacks, 
since he has coached the 
position in stops with Rutgers 
and the Denver Broncos.
What all this means for 
Michigan 
is 
that 
the 
10 
members of its coaching staff, 
which had been in flux all 
offseason, are finally settled.
Hamilton, 
McElwain, 
defensive line coach Greg 
Mattison and VIPER coach Al 
Washington are out. Gattis, 
McDaniels, 
former 
Boston 
College defensive coordinator 
Anthony 
Campanile 
and 
former Arizona State defensive 
line coach Shaun Nua are in.
Now the staff is complete, 
and there are only 207 days 
until the Wolverines kick off 
against 
Middle 
Tennessee 
State.

Michigan gets back on track, tops Rutgers 77-65

PISCATAWAY — Geo Baker 
stood dead center, well beyond the 
arc, and fired for three.
The shot landed to cap off an 
8-0 run, and with just over three 
minutes left in the first half, 
Michigan’s lead was down to single 
digits for the first time since the 
under-16 timeout.
It was the first of several times 
Rutgers tried to make things 
interesting. But this time, the 
magic wasn’t there. A minute later, 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole 
returned the favor with a three of 
his own, then after a block on the 
defensive end, freshman forward 
Ignas Brazdeikis drove into the 
paint for a layup. And despite a few 
similar moments in the second half 
— where the Scarlet Knights got 
the deficit under 10 four separate 
times — the No. 5 Michigan men’s 
basketball team (21-2 overall, 10-2 
Big Ten) ultimately scored too 

much, too quick, leaving Rutgers 
(11-11 overall, 4-8 Big Ten) unable 
to keep up in the Wolverines’ 77-65 
win.
“They got off to a great start,” 
said Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell. 
“And we kind of went digging, 
digging, digging and I told them 
they could’ve made it interesting. 
… But we needed some timely 
stops defensively or some timely 
offensive possessions and you just 
can’t play that way. Every time we 
made a mistake, they made us pay 
on the offensive end.”
Michigan started the game 
5-for-5 from the field and, for much 
of the first half, got whatever it 
wanted on offense. Seven minutes 
into the period, redshirt junior 
wing Charles Matthews scored 
seven consecutive points for the 
Wolverines on two free throws, 
a 3-pointer and a turnaround 
jumper — part of a 19-4 run that put 
Michigan up 17 not even 10 minutes 
into the half.
The lead was so large that despite 

no fouls from anyone on the team, 
freshman forward Brandon Johns 
subbed in with 13:37 remaining. 
Unlike most of his previous 
appearances — like one last Friday 
at Iowa when other options at the 
‘5’ were in foul trouble — this one 
was not out of desperation, but 
luxury.
Other than the 8-0 run at the end, 
the rest of the period proceeded 
similarly, 
with 
Brazdeikis 
especially taking advantage of 
every Scarlet Knights defensive 
breakdown. He finished with 23 
points — his seventh 20-point game 
of the season — while leading the 
team with five 3-pointers.
“They definitely didn’t prepare 
for my 3-point shot, I feel like,” 
Brazdeikis said. “They didn’t close 
out as hard and left me open so it 
was an advantage for us.”
But in the second half, the brand 
of junkball that the Scarlet Knights 
have ridden to four conference 
wins came out. The field goals 
that had dropped so effortlessly 

for 
the 
Wolverines 
early 
on 
couldn’t find the net. But whenever 
Rutgers started to inch within the 
possibility of an upset, Michigan 
answered back. After a thunderous 
dunk by Shaquille Doorson cut 
the lead to seven five minutes in, 
the Scarlet Knights turned the 
ball over and fouled junior guard 
Zavier Simpson, leading to two 
free throws and then back-to-back 
threes from Poole — who shook 
off a shooting slump by scoring 15 
points and going 3-for-6 from deep 
— and Brazdeikis.
Rutgers fought as hard as it 
could, but in a second-half defensive 
battle, it was unable to cut into the 
Wolverines’ lead enough to make 
anything happen.
It wasn’t a pretty win by any 
means, but in the end it got the job 
done. And on the road in the Big 
Ten — with a first half that provided 
hope the Wolverines would find 
their way out of their recent 
offensive struggles — sometimes 
that’s all you can ask for.

Ball movement, 3-point shooting spark ‘M’

PISCATAWAY 
— 
Despite 
his team’s 21-2 record and top-
10 national ranking, Michigan 
coach John Beilein has cast a 
frustrated figure for much of 
the last month. Wins and losses 
alike have been met with an 
unsatisfied air — a feeling that 
the Wolverines have failed 
to 
maximize 
the 
potential 
displayed in their 19-0 start.
So when Beilein entered 
the Rutgers Athletic Center 
media room 20 minutes after 
Michigan’s bland 77-65 win 
against the Big Ten’s perennial 
doormat Tuesday night, the 
expectation 
was 
for 
more 
of the same. But before the 
questions even began, Beilein 
sat down and offered a different 
assessment.
“We were really good today,” 
he said. “I really loved just about 
everything about our game.”
The reason for his change in 
tune? One simple line in the box 
score that read, 11-of-23.
That, of course, was the 
Wolverines’ 
stat 
line 
from 
3-point range Tuesday night. 
Just last year — when Michigan 
ranked 4th in the Big Ten with 
a 37.3 shooting percentage from 
deep — that would have been 
impressive, but nothing out of 
the ordinary. This season, it’s 
a revelation — 
just the second 
time in 10 tries 
since the New 
Year 
that 
the 
Wolverines have 
shot 40 percent 
from three.
For 
a 
Michigan team 
that now ranks 
10th 
in 
the 
conference with 
a 
31.5 
shooting 
percentage 
from deep, Friday’s 8-for-33 
performance in a loss at Iowa 
was rock bottom, as it couldn’t 
move the ball into open looks. 
Instead, it repeatedly forced up 
contested shots in a desperate 
attempt to claw back into the 
game before falling to a 15-point 
defeat.
“Just keep practicing… and 

hopefully, we’ll make some 
shots,” Beilein said after that 
game. “We’ve seen some of our 
guys go out there and really 
have good shooting days. Today, 
we didn’t have great shooting 
days.”
Rather than spending the 
three 
days 
between 
games 
preparing 
for 
Rutgers 
as 
they 
typically 
would, 
the 
Wolverines did exactly that, 
turning introspective in hopes 
of solving their 
3-point woes.
Against 
the 
Scarlet 
Knights, it was 
immediately 
clear 
that 
the 
approach 
had 
paid 
off. 
Freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
opened the game 
with a three on Michigan’s first 
possession. A few minutes later, 
junior guard Zavier Simpson 
found the freshman forward 
again wide open in the corner. 
The next time the Wolverines 
tried from deep, it was redshirt 
junior wing Charles Matthews 
springing sophomore Jordan 
Poole open at the top of the arc. 
By the time Michigan finally 

missed a 3-pointer, 7:22 into the 
game, it led 18-6.
“I think at the very beginning, 
the ball movement was great,” 
Beilein said. “We just moved it 
really well.”
Each time Rutgers threatened 
to put a serious dent in that 
lead, Michigan’s ball movement 
provided it with a much-needed 
buffer. 
When 
the 
Scarlet 
Knights made their biggest run 
of the night — an 8-0 stretch to 
cut it to single 
digits 
with 
two minutes to 
play in the first 
half — it was 
again Matthews 
assisting Poole to 
snap Michigan’s 
dry spell.
“We’re 
definitely 
all 
unselfish players 
and we play for 
the team,” Brazdeikis said. “We 
put the team first. Definitely 
today, that was an emphasis and 
we were moving the ball really 
well.”
Five minutes into the second 
half — the next time the lead 
shrunk 
to 
single 
digits 
— 
Simpson drove into the lane, 
dishing it to Poole beyond the 
arc. Again, he found bottom.

Ten 
feet 
away, 
Beilein 
looked on emotionless — the 
best in-game approval he will 
ever offer. Two possessions 
later, when Poole’s isolation 
tendency returned, the coach 
reverted to the emotions that 
he displayed so often last week 
in Iowa City, dropping his head 
into his hands before turning 
to assistant coach DeAndre 
Haynes with a befuddled look.
“It still stuck a few times and 
we’re 
working 
on that,” Beilein 
said. “Because 
we 
do 
have 
some 
talent 
that 
can 
get 
their own shot. 
But sometimes, 
the more you 
dribble it, the 
more everybody 
gets 
into 
the 
gap and you’re 
not gonna be able to get your 
stuff.”
Tuesday night, though, that 
look was rarely on display. And 
when a Rutgers’ miss with 1:39 
left sent the crowd toward 
the exit and drew chants of, 
“Let’s Go Blue,” Beilein finally 
cracked a smile.
For the first time in weeks, it 
came because of his offense.

ating. A word that is thrown 
around casually at home in Amer-
ica is a word that, if uttered in an 
Indian household, causes the television’s 
volume to be lowered, the newspaper to 
be slowly folded, and the hustle and bus-
tle to come to a standstill.
 In my household, dating is frowned 
upon to an unnatural extent. Since high 
school started, if a celebrity couple was 
brought up when we discussed pop cul-
ture, the only reaction would be my dad 
looking over his glasses, asking if I also 
was in a relationship. The answer always 
stayed at a constant “no” regardless of my 
true relationship status. Lying was never 
the intention, but it seemed easier to lie 
than to get engaged in an argument that 
would more often than not last longer 
than the relationship itself. As I got older, 
the lies got more and more elaborate. I 
had to mask not only crushes, but entire 
relationships from start to finish.
 Growing up as a brown girl in subur-
bia, the amount of teenage heartbreak you 
have to face with no familial support is in-
tense. You have to cry over boys silently 
in your room, and then when your mom 
calls you down for dinner, you wipe away 
your tears and face your family as if noth-
ing happened. I understand the cultural 
differences between the time and place 
my parents were raised and the time and 
place I was, but these secrets damage you 
more than Indian parents know.
 Even when I successfully pulled off 
a guise of happiness following a rough 

breakup or emotional moment, I tended 
to be more snappier around my parents 
and played the victim whenever they said 
anything. Moments like these turned into 
bigger fights and I, already overcome with 
my own emotions, tended to break down 
faster, which confused my parents and led 
to more reprimanding for being too emo-
tional. As a result, I, and so many of my 
brown female friends, found ourselves be-
coming caught in a vicious cycle of a lack 
of familial trust.
 We felt that our parents didn’t trust us, 
and we also couldn’t confide in them. We 
hid more secrets and our parents, as par-
ents usually do, found out and trusted us 
even less. Every secret relationship we 
had led to more and more secrets being 
kept from our parents and the bar we set 
for ourselves in terms of honesty plum-
meted.
 As I grew up and entered college, I fos-
tered the connection and trust I had with 
my parents, but never to the extent it was 
before. My parents and so many other 
Indian parents believe that not allowing 
their kids to date will protect them from 
relationships and the negatives that come 
with them, but it never does. All it does 
is teach their kids to lie better and causes 
them to grow apart from their parents.
While I will always appreciate the effort 
my parents have put in to make me as 
happy as possible, I will also always regret 
that I’ve lied to them so many times. But 
at the same time, I never felt that I had a 
chance not to lie.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | FEBRUARY 6, 2019

Dear Reader,
M
ichigan in Color was created five 
years ago in order to uplift the voices 
of people of color by offering a platform 
dedicated to every aspect of identities of 
color -– the heartbreaking stories, the calls 
to action, the feelgood moments and the 
frustrations. Throughout the years we have 
expanded from a column to a full-fledged 
section of The Michigan Daily, producing 
creative content, written narratives, a pod-
cast, and now, as a part of an annual tradi-
tion, a collaboration with the Statement 
magazine. 

In this special edition Statement and Michi-
gan in Color collaboration, you will find tes-
timonies on what it means to love as a per-
son of color — whether the recipient of that 
love is a mother, a significant other or even 
yourself. The complexity of love is often 
magnified by complex identities, and we are 
so grateful to The Statement for extending 
a platform for students of color to explore 
love’s intricacies. Enjoy the issue!

In solidarity,

 
Carly and Na’kia

A

s a Chinese-American bisex-
ual girl, my love and sex 
life have been a mess from 
the start. Long before I knew I was 
also into girls, I was super into boys, 
and not afraid to be upfront about 
it. I think I was something of a femi-
nist in middle school before I really 
learned about or knew what feminism 
actually was because I thought that 
girls waiting for boys to ask them 
out all because of social and gender 
norms was dumb. I’d ask boys out.
But growing up as a kid in the 2000s, 
I didn’t feel very attractive. I didn’t 
look like Barbie and have long blonde 
hair, big blue eyes, freckles, or the 
tiny, upturned nose I wanted to have 
so badly. All of these, of course, were 
Eurocentric beauty standards. In the 
romance movies I watched as a kid, all 
the female protagonists were white — 
there was very little Asian representa-
tion in the media. When I was younger, 
I didn’t think I was attractive at all 
because I wasn’t white. And of course, 
as a kid, I went through the whole 
“only attracted to white boys” phase — 
something that’s very common among 
young Asian girls, but deeply rooted in 
internalized racism and societal norms 
about what the West deems beauty 
and desirability to look like. I dreamed 
of being the good-looking, average 
American girl next door and I so badly 
wanted a white boyfriend. I used to 
think that if I could just have a white 
dude named Jake to love me, I would 
somehow feel validated and more 
beautiful because someone like that 
could be attracted to someone like me.
Looking back ten years later, I real-
ize how wrong I was. It took me a 
while to accept myself as Asian. In my 
early teen years, I tried to play myself 
off by being the most non-stereotyp-
ical Asian girl: I was super outgoing 
and not afraid to say what was on my 
mind, wasn’t afraid to make the first 
move with boys I was interested in, 
listened to a lot of Green Day and wore 
a lot of black. I was trying to send out 
the message that I was “not like other 

Asian girls.” In my mind, I imagined 
Asian girls to be unattractive nerds 
complicit in our own dehumanization 
and oppression (Chinese culture places 
importance in society on older men, 
and most older Chinese families have 
a preference for sons over daughters). 
But with social media now, I see a lot 
more faces in my feed that look like 
mine — Asian girls on Instagram being 
fashionable and looking cute. But with 
the rebranding of Asian girls from 
being the undesirable nerd with bangs 
to being the sexy, long-haired tattooed 
party girl with eyelash extensions, it 
still didn’t quite fit with what I was.
And, for better or worse, my experi-
ence with boys changed from “you’re 
not attractive because you’re Asian” to 
the “you’re attractive because you’re 
Asian” sort of fetishization by white 
men — which I soon learned, did not 
put me in a better place at all (both 
above statements are gross and racist). 
A number of guys I’ve hooked up with 
have told me, “I just think Asian women 
are the hottest,” or “You would make 
so much money if you did porn.” In 
pop culture and porn especially, Asian 
women are fetishized and portrayed as 
submissive sexual objects or “Dragon 
ladies,” a stereotype of Asian women as 
mysterious, deceiving, and domineer-
ing (much like a sexy ninja). It’s hard 
for me as a girl who enjoys asserting 
and owning my sexuality to not fit into 
these sorts of stereotypes — and what’s 
more, I hate it when men try to play it 
off like I’m doing this for them like no, 
stop, my sexual prowess is my own.
Even after coming to college at the 
University of Michigan, I still encoun-
ter such ignorance and fetishization of 
my race. Someone I met at a tailgate said 
to me, “You’re the sexiest Asian I’ve 
ever seen,” and someone from my eco-
nomics discussion told me, “I’ve never 
had Asian pussy before.” I told him 
to stop fetishizing my race, to which 
he replied, “If anything, I thought it 
would be more of an incentive for you.” 
Excuse me, “Chad,” I’m not eight any-
more and I don’t need a white boy’s 

attention to feel accepted and wanted.
Now: women. Being bisexual is hard 
enough as it is. But being Asian and 
bisexual is where it gets even more 
complicated. When I tentatively came 
out at age 14, people were shocked that 
I was attracted to women and were 
shocked that someone who grew up 
in a strict Asian household could be 
bisexual. Again, I was haunted by ste-
reotypes of being the perfect docile 
Chinese daughter who never did any-
thing wrong (although my peers knew 
perfectly well what I was up to behind 
my parents’ backs). Additionally, being 
fetishized for my race was already 
annoying enough — I now had to deal 
with guys fetishizing my sexuality 
and asking me if I would have a three-
some. It’s hard to be a sexual person 
by nature and not fall into these rac-
ist, sexist stereotypes of being merely 
a sexual object for men’s pleasure. I 
wanted to be able to enjoy sex and rela-
tionships without being overly sexual-
ized and objectified just for my identity.
I’ve even been referred to as an 
Asian “manic pixie dream girl.” Manic 
pixie dream girls are a trope in film and 
television for a quirky and alternative 
sort of female character who “isn’t like 
other girls,” and exist only to help the 
male protagonist rediscover or better 
himself. But that’s not me in relation-
ships or sex at all. I — like every other 
woman — am complicated and smart 
and angry and confused and happy. I 
have interests outside of the bedroom. I 
have goals of my own that don’t include 
fixing broken men and being the mys-
terious dark-haired lover with black 
combat boots and big eyeliner-rimmed 
eyes. I — like other bisexual women of 
color — am so much more than that. 
And I sure as hell don’t need society 
or “Chad” telling me how I should act 
based on a shitty pop culture reference. 
My bisexuality is not for men to sexu-
alize. My Chinese heritage is not for 
people to fetishize and make assump-
tions about — and most of all, I am not 
your Asian manic pixie dream girl.

ear Mom,

First, I love you for every-
thing about you, and I think that you 
are one of the most beautiful people that 
I’ve ever seen. I love the way that the 
sun illuminates your skin — the natu-
ral glow that gleams effortlessly among 
the pigmentation of your melanin. It is 
the most beautiful shade of brown and 
earth, and when I feel overwhelmed 
and insecure in a sea of white, it is the 
first thing I want to see to wrap me in 
its embrace.
Undoubtedly, you are my biggest and 
best supporter. I will never be able to 

put into words how thankful I am for 
everything that you’ve done for me. 
Whenever I am sad or low in energy, 
a phone call from you is all that I need 
to uplift my spirit. Your kindness and 
humor is medicine for my ever-racing 
mind, and I know for a fact that I would 
not be whole without your butter voice 
helping me hold it together.
I thank you so much for wearing your 
hair natural, instilling in me a love for 
my roots. You were, and continue to be, 
my hair inspiration. When I felt lost in 
my pursuit to reclaim agency over my 
own self-esteem and appearance, I was 
able to look no further than your crown 

of coils for assurance and ease. I thank 
you for accepting me for who I am, in 
all of my flaws, errors, messy rooms 
and dirty laundry baskets. You give me 
so much grace, more than I deserve, 
because you always try your best to be 
compassionate to my young adult strug-
gles. I strive to always pay you back the 
same love, and I hope that one day I can 
grow into a heart that is as big and for-
giving as yours.
Your blood runs pertinent and sure 
in my veins and, along with that, from 
our elders and ancestors, is the essence 
through which I strive to ground my 
strengths in. It is through generational 

resilience and perseverance that I am 
made, and I give honor to the example 
of unwavering solidity that you have set 
for me.
This letter will never be enough to 
fully capture how much love I have for 
you, but I hope that this dedication will 
give you even the slightest sense of the 
admiration that I have for you. I love 
you dearly.

Love,
Na’kia

studies Communications and is also 
extremely engaged in campus as a 
member of many organizations within 
the U-M black community.

How would you personally define self-love?
Freddie: Self-love is being ok even in the case of 
your setbacks and failures you can still be a good 
person even when making mistakes.
Cyd: Self-love is the necessity of actively seeking 
out the beauty in all of your individual flaws, tak-
ing time to work on making your strengths stron-
ger, and then actually believing your own voice 
when you hear it say, “I love me”.
Jose: Self-love is accepting yourself for who you 
are mentally and physically, and that includes your 
flaws. It means not trying to change or adapt to the 
expectations of others.
Summer: Self-love is the act of putting your 
physical, emotional, social and mental health as a 
priority. Also, just the basic care and compassion 
towards your body, mind and spirit.
Charles: Self-love is being content with who you 
are every morning. Doing things that make you 
happy, not just your physical well-being, but also 
your mental.

In what ways do your identities play into 
your concept of self-love?
Freddie: In the Mexican community, self-love 
often means your family is doing well. It’s like a 
cultivated focus. So that can occasionally be very 

counterintuitive because if you’re always focus-
ing on other people, you don’t have much time 
to develop as an individual.
Cyd: The world works very hard to convince 
me, as a Black woman, that I am not destined 
to be as beautiful or as successful as someone 
else. It tells me every single day that if I don’t 
play dumb, that if I don’t release some level of 
my ambition, that if I just let men take advan-
tage of my complacency, I’ll spend my life alone. 
I am told daily that my body is not ideal. That if 
I want to be liked, I need to change the way I 
look and dress. Under all of that scrutiny, it is 
important to me to spend time with myself.
I like to reassure Cydney of her undeniable 
self-worth and recognize that the things that 
make Cydney who she is, are the reasons why 
she is beautiful, capable and strong.
Jose: In contrast to how many Dominicans 
are raised machismo pride and lack of emotion, 
I was raised on pride in loving myself as a man. 
I guess like not being afraid of showing emotion 
and embracing emotion in a way that allowed 
me to self-reflect.
Summer: Because I value my identity as a 
mixed, cis woman, I practice self-love in ways 
that are accustomed to those identities. For 
example, my femininity screams for different 
types of physical love than other genders. Also, 
being mixed, I know mentally what differences 
I have between the general populous (good and 
bad). I use that knowledge to constantly moti-
vate positive thinking and good spirits wher-
ever I go.
Charles: As a dark skinned Black man espe-
cially, I’ve come to have to learn how to love 
myself even when the world doesn’t. I realized 
that I have had to try even harder to understand 
my worth and to ensure to maintain it. I love 
the skin I’m in and I use that confidence to my 
ability whenever I can. I’m much quicker to 
accept myself for who I am, whether it be posi-
tive or negative.

Has your concept of self-love ever recog-
nizably shifted? Explain.
Freddie: I always felt very grounded in my 
morals and the things that I saw as being cen-
tral to my sense of self before coming to col-
lege. Then I got to UMich, and like my sense of 
identity changed a lot and I wasn’t okay with 
that at first because I was like, “Oh fuck, this is 
what people appreciated about me before, who 
am I now?” Because that’s not what I was doing 
anymore. Pretty much it took me a minute to 
change my mindset to recognize that even 
though those things are important to me, those 
things aren’t me.
Cyd: Hell yeah! Self-love for me used to very 
superficial. It was not until recently I added 
emotional support for myself into the mix. Also 
recognizing that sometimes self-care is finding 
help when you need it and saying “no” if you 
cannot commit to all of the things people are 
expecting your commitment for. There is no 
inherent value in spreading yourself too thin 

for the sake of pleasing other people’s agen-
das. If the thought of being a part of something 
brings me dread, I decommit. And you know 
what? I’ve stopped feeling guilty about it.
Jose: In high school, I didn’t pay that much 
attention to understanding self-love, but after 
coming to Michigan I was definitely forced 
to pay more attention to it. As I faced more 
hardships and struggles, I realized I had to be 
grounded in taking care of myself in order to 
overcome them.
Summer: My transition from high school 
to college changed how I envisioned self-
love for myself. In high school, I loved others 
before myself in fear of being ridiculed (usually 
because of my difference in beliefs/identities). 
As a college student, I now know that I am what 
deserves love and I know how to balance caring 
for others and myself in HEALTHY ways!
Charles: The most it has shifted in the last 
couple years is my relationship with God. The 
closer I’ve gotten to him the more I’ve realized 
what love is truly, and have been able to apply to 
not only others but myself as well.

What do you do when you realize you 
haven’t been “self-caring”?
Freddie: The biggest thing that has helped 
me is mindfulness, being aware of my own 
actions and how my actions are reflected onto 
other people. Also recognizing what habits and 
qualities in myself are causing me to regress to 
those places of not taking care of myself. This 
usually looks like focusing on what helped me 
have a better day like, “Did I drink coffee in the 
morning? Did I hang out with my friends and 
study by myself at night?” Also like learning to 
be ok with being comfortable with ambiguity 
because many things aren’t in our control and 
accepting that helps you move forward.
Cyd: It usually takes me a minute to notice, 
but I’ll stop working out, stop eating, and I get 
moody. That’s when I realize like, “Oh...I need 
to spend some time for introspection.” I try to 
do small things every day for myself. Like my 
end of the day skin/body routine is my safe 
place. I like to go through the whole nine yards 
slowly with music in the background. Last 
night was ’90s hip hop while I did a face mask, I 
exfoliated to Adele and I moisturized to smooth 
jazz.
Coming back to that consistent routine can 
usually ground me after a day that felt *off * for 
whatever reason.
Jose: In these times, I usually try to devote 
my time to interesting new hobbies, as well as 
hanging out with friends and doing just other 
simple things I enjoy. These things help take 
my mind away from those negative things and 
anchors me in the positive aspects of my life.
Summer: When I realize I haven’t been “self-
loving,” I like to see what event happened that 
may have thrown off my routine. Then after 
reflection, I do something that notoriously 
makes me feel better (hang with friends, eat 
pickles, with Princess Mononoke, etc.). Engag-

ing in happy actions after reflection can soothe 
pent up-emotions. After, I like to plan my days 
out and find at least one or two things I can do 
that will incorporate more “self-love” in my 
routine!
Charles: I personally realize when I haven’t 
been doing my self-care routine, is when I 
haven’t been writing or taking enough time to 
do what I enjoy doing.

What’s your current self- love routine?
Freddie: As I mentioned previously, it focus-
es on mindfulness, like really paying attention 
to things surrounding myself. I enjoy being 
around people that motivate me and give me 
energy. Mentoring other people also helps a 
lot, as making sure people are on a good path 
means that I have to make sure I’m taking care 
of myself.
Cyd: Recently I have been doing self-care in 
the form of taking long periods of time with-
out speaking to anyone. I like quietly walking 
across campus and thinking about my day and 
what I need to do. Another thing that calms 
me down is completely decluttering my space. 
Every day, when my academic day is over, I get 
elated with the thought of coming back to my 
room and “putting on my cozies” haha. I end 
my day by cleaning (organizing) my room. I 
recently hung up my 2019 vision board and I 
will also admit that manifestation is the truth 
and the way. It’s as powerful as praying! I love 
waking up and having my goals be the first 
thing I see.
Jose: I definitely seek the company of friends 
along with talking to my parents, which replen-
ishes my motivation to keep going so I can be 
able to contribute to motivate family back 
home. I also really like doing yoga too because it 
allows (me) to physically take care of myself in 
relaxing myself both physically and mentally.
Summer: My current self-love routine is very 
simple! I start my day with a nice skin and hair 
care routine. Then I plan out my day so that I 
can save any anxiety later and manage my time 
better. During the day, I try to find time to do 
stuff other than homework or work like read 
an article, watch a video or draw. This is a nice 
practice to clear your mind throughout the day. 
As the day ends, I try to squeeze in a workout, a 
shower, and then use essential oils and crystal 
energy to ensure a nice sound sleep to restart 
my routine.
Charles: For me, my self-care routine is mak-
ing sure that I take the time out to write music 
and also eating right. I’ll make sure that I have 
something to eat and a smoothie especially, 
going to the park is something that brings me 
peace, too. Just being in nature helps me realize 
that I’m a part of something much bigger than 
me. Hearing the birds chirp and the sun glow-
ing on my face always brings a smile to my face.

ow often do you put yourself 
down? Talk to yourself in neg-

you’re not good enough?
Really think about how often you do 
this to yourself.
I’ve been there, and I am constantly 
critical of myself and what I achieve. Key-
word: achieve. I measure myself by my 
successes, and when I fail, I take it as a 
self-reflection of my whole being — that 
I’m not good enough and I don’t have what 
it takes.
I realized that learning to accept your-
self is crucial to self-love. Because at the 
end of the day, you have to spend a lot of 
time with yourself and your thoughts, 
and you should probably learn how to like 
yourself. Now, this sounds obvious, but 
if you take a step back and really analyze 
how you talk to yourself, you might be sur-
prised.
While definitely a journey, self-accep-
tance is like building any other skill. You 
constantly have to work on it deliberately. 
At times, you are your own worst enemy, 
comparing yourself to others, especially 
in a society of production and consump-
tion, you are thought to be only as good as 

I.
it’s past midnight and i start thinking 
about my umma[1] dying again. she’s not 
dead, but as my head starts to spin i think—
well what if she gets into a car accident 
tomorrow morning on her way to work, 
you know anything can happen on the 
new jersey turnpike, wait she doesn’t take 
the new jersey turnpike anymore since 
we’ve moved, but what if she gets into a 
car accident anyway, they happen pretty 
frequently, and then she’ll be gone forever, 
and i didn’t even hug her goodbye when 
she dropped me off for an interview on 
move-in day
— and my chest heaves up and down, so 
i text my umma and tell her that i love her, 
and i miss her. just in case. (my umma is 
alive, by the way.)

II.
the first time i had anxiety about my 
umma dying was sometime between pre-
school and kindergarten. i had a night-
mare my umma never came back from her 
ESL classes at bergen community college. 
i don’t remember if this was before or after 
the car accident we were in. (it wasn’t on 
the new jersey turnpike.)
she took me to community college with 
her. she took me to the laundromat with 
her. she took me to the grocery store with 
her. she took me to the nail salon with her, 
where she worked seven days a week, non-
stop. we didn’t have a babysitter then.
the day the patriots played the giants in 
the super bowl and lost, my umma stayed 
out at work for a long time, and to this day 
i still remember calling her and her not 
picking up the phone and wondering if 
she was okay, wishing she was home with 
me and appa[2] on sunday nights. (she was 
okay, but driving back, so couldn’t pick up 
the phone.)

III.
at my new elementary school i would 
see kids being picked up by their mothers, 
in their minivans, off to play soccer or go 
on a playdate or to violin lessons. and just 
once, just once, i wished i could be picked 
up by her.
i have a friend from high school who 
tells her mother everything, and i wish 
this were true of my umma and i. but 
there is too much to catch up on what she 
missed.

IV.
i tell all my friends, my umma is the best, 
too good for this world. she still works 
seven days a week, non-stop, juggling two 
jobs, cooking all the food, cleaning the 
apartment; she says she loves to work.

what you produce or what you achieve. But 
rarely, you are judged by who you are, your 
emotional capacity and intelligence, your 
ability to love and be loved.
Furthermore, you constantly have to 
keep yourself in check about promoting 
positive and action-oriented feedback so 
you can do better. It’s not about having a 
fixed mindset, but rather having a growth 
mindset. Allow yourself to make mistakes 
and fail — which is really scary — but nec-
essary in order for us to grow. Having a 
growth mindset allows us to be critical 
of our weaknesses and shortcomings, but 
also allows us to recognize our strengths 
and assets, and that everything is a pro-
cess. While we tend to be oriented around 
big aspirations, being present in the period 
we are at in our journey and seeing how 
far we’ve come is encouraging and essen-
tial to fully accepting our process of self-
acceptance and self-love.
How can we expect others to like and 
love us if we can’t even do it ourselves? 
Once you find that inner harmony within 
yourself, others will recognize it and give 
you the respect of who you are because 
you respect yourself. They recognize that 
you treat and talk to yourself with value 
and worth, and will give the same to you — 
and maybe subconsciously recognize that 
and try to do it for themselves. Because of 
all the noise within society today, and so 
many external forces, it’s hard to differ-
entiate your self-worth compared to oth-
ers — but you have to find that silence and 
peace within yourself.
Once you do find a balance between self-
acceptance and self-love, you can spread 
that to others. This is key, because finding 
that inner harmony allows us to become 
more empathetic and giving of the “feels,” 
love and so much more. This in turn, helps 
us infuse that spirit to other people. To 
help them if they are beating themselves 
up, or feeling down.
If self-love may seem too far-fetched for 
you, start by liking yourself maybe even 
just a little. How can you do this? Treat 
yo’self. Stop putting energy into degrading 
yourself and confining yourself, because 
you’re only limiting your full potential. 
Stop that voice in the back of your head 
that you’re not good enough, and actively 
work on telling yourself that you are, and 
you are trying your best. Recognize the 
talents you have and compliment yourself, 
laugh at your own jokes, meditate, breath, 
go to that dance class, buy that piece of 
pizza, or break out into random song and 
dance like you’re in a musical. Whatever 
that looks like for you, do it!
My journey for self-acceptance and self-
love has been a process. Don’t quantify 
your love through capitalizing it this Val-
entine’s season, and focus on the energy 
you give to yourself, which you can then 
give to others. Take the time to assess 
yourself so you can give to others all the 
feels, emotions, and love that you have. 
You are a unique human being with the 
ability and capacity to feel and love and 

connect. So I challenge you to learn 
how to fully accept yourself, because 
your relationship with yourself is 
one of the most important in your 
life, isn’t it?

poem

Why your 
relationship 
with yourself 
is important

even when she’s angry or sad or frus-
trated she makes the effort to understand 
others. even when she says things that 
are rooted in bias, like when she said my 
bisexuality was just a phase, i know she 
tries to understand me. she still loves me. 
and that feels quite rare in the asian queer 
community.
i resented her for never being there for 
me when i was younger. but now i know 
she was only trying to help us climb the 
impossible ladder of the nonexistent amer-
ican dream.
my umma crossed an ocean with her 
only child and her husband so that my appa 
could pursue his dream of getting an MBA 
in the USA. she told me she majored in ger-
man when she was in college, because that 
was where her favorite pianists, bach and 
beethoven, were from. she wanted to go to 
germany. she went to america instead. she 
still hasn’t been to germany.
my umma lost her umma when i was 
seven to cancer. she takes care of her 
mother-in-law, my halumni[3], like she’s 
her own mother. maybe that’s why i’m 
afraid of her dying even though she only 
turned fifty just a few years ago.

French Kiss

She touched my lips on the first 
day in May

Her lips made the cold go away

My heart was iced over

Frozen solid, stone cold

I thought I’d die

Before I had the chance to grow 
old

Her lips brought me back to life

Their sweet peppermint taste 
made everything seem right

Her lips were everything that 
meant peace

Her lips were everything that 
meant me

She touched my lips on the first 
day in May

Her lips made the sun shine its 
rays

Dare I say

Her lips were made for me

Dare I say

Her lips had sailed the high 
seas to get to me

Dare I say

Her lips were everything they 
would always be

And she touched my lips on a 
warm day in July

To say goodbye

Dare I say

She loved my lie

in class, I fully compensated for on Face-
book messenger. As a somewhat shy and 
awkward kid in middle school, it was 
quite nerve-racking to talk to girls with-
out some sort of third party judgement 
from my friends or my mother. There-
fore, whatever I wanted to say to people 
of Facebook seemed to be limitless. In 
fact, whenever I go back and read those 
messages, I still blush a little bit at my 
attempts to flirt with girls in the most 
corny and tragic way possible. There-
fore, it was an actual nightmare when 
one morning, my mother had conve-
niently found that I had forgot to log out 
of my Facebook account and decided to 
read every message I had. I came back 
from school that day and was forced to 
listen in horror as my mother analyzed 
every message I wrote and asked to me 
to explain what I meant by them.
To this day, I will never understand 
the motivation behind why of parents 
forbid middle school relationships. 
Like honestly, what’s the worst thing 
that could’ve happened? I don’t know 
a single person that looks back at their 
middle school relationships with any-
thing but a grain of salt because of how 
cringe-worthy they were. Also, I will 
never understand my own mother’s 
motivation for trying to find as much 
information as possible about my peers 
through Facebook. You’re not going to 
learn anything about a girl in middle 
school by looking at her Facebook pro-
file, beside the fact that she went to Dis-
ney World over the summer through 
her profile picture and maybe her Farm-
ville score.
Despite this traumatic event, that 
wasn’t the last time I flirted with a girl 
on social media because social media 
has kept growing. A large number of 
our interactions with people are carried 
out through our phones. When I had 
gotten my first iPhone in high school, 
my limited use of social media started 
to grow as I joined other social media 
platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram 
and Twitter. At this point, I remem-
ber my mother feeling a little anxious 
because she just couldn’t keep up with 
all of these different mediums. There-
fore, after a day of scouring the internet 
for information about these different 
apps, she aggressively started to preach 
against the use of social media. At the 
time, I would simply roll my eyes and 
came to the conclusion that my mother 
was insane.
But it wasn’t until I was in college 
that I really started to value interact-
ing with people in person, and I started 
to realize that my mother’s frequent 
tirades against social media were for a 
good reason. There have been a count-
less number of recent studies that link 
social media with teenage anxiety and 
depression. People care too much about 
how many likes their Instagram photo 
gets or why their crush on Snapchat has 
left them on “opened” and the hourglass 
emoji has appeared (which signifies the 

end of a “streak”). All of these aspects of 
social media just add on an unnecessary 
amount of stress to one’s life.
But let’s unpack that. What does it 
mean when a person likes your photo on 
Instagram or Facebook? A “like” would 
probably be the equivalent of a person 
coming up to you in person and say-
ing, “Hey, I like that photo you took,” 
or “Hey, you look really good in that 
photo,” and so on. But Instagram has 
replaced a meaningful human interac-
tion with the simple and convenient tap 
of a finger on a screen. Snapchat isn’t any 
better. While one may argue that having 
a “streak” of 100 days shows dedication, 
it really doesn’t. Let’s be honest — out 
of the 100, 10 days might be actual sub-
stance and the rest are just Snapchats of 
your forehead, random out-of-context 
selfies or even better yet, Snapchats of 
the wall or the ceiling. One of my best 
friends has been Snapchatting a girl for 
almost a year now, went to high school 
with her and has a class with her now in 
college, but has still yet to have a single 
conversation with her in person.
And look, I can’t completely attack 
social media, because I do frequently 
scroll through my Facebook timeline 
and occasionally post photos on Insta-
gram. And yes, there are good uses for 
it. I’ll probably be sharing this article 
on Facebook in order to get my friends 
to read it. However, what I do find dis-
turbing is that our use of social media 
is giving us an excuse to not interact 
with each other in person and is trying 
to replace a very healthy social interac-
tion.
So this Valentine’s Day, be bold and 
go take a risk. Go talk to that person 
that you’ve been crushing on from afar 
or have been Snapchatting for a year 
now. Don’t scroll through this person’s 
Instagram or enviously look at photos 
that your friends are posting with their 
significant others. If you’re watching a 
romantic comedy, don’t do it alone with 
a quart of ice cream. Instead, do it with 
friends and surround yourself with 
people who care about you. And last 
but not least, don’t be me from middle 
school and flirt with people on Face-
book messenger. If anything, go out 
there and have these experiences first 
hand, in real time. I do realize that this 
does have the potential of going terribly 
wrong, but at least you’ll have a good 
story to tell at the end of it.

I

’ve had very little experience 
with love. But I have seen 
enough romantic comedies 
starring Ryan Gosling and have lis-
tened enough songs by Rex Orange 
County and Frank Ocean to at least 
know that Love is a complicated 
emotion. It’s not an emotion like 
happiness or anger, where most of 
the time, we know how and when 
to register these emotions. Love, on 
the other hand, is something that 
we’re still trying to figure out as 
young adults. But before I start try-
ing to talk about something I am very 
unqualified to talk about, I’m going 
to take us back to a time when Love 
was nothing but a complete mess.
Middle school is an interesting 
time for love, and yes, in case you 
were wondering, I could hear every-
one who’s reading this article groan 
as they start to recall their awkward 
middle school relationships. But 
here’s how I see it. In elementary 
school, girls and boys are constant-
ly at war and trying to torture each 
other on playgrounds. But as soon 
as the sixth grade rolled around and 
Bruno Mars came out with “Just 
the way you are,” every 12-year-old 
guy was trying to find a girl to sing 
it to. And while every girl in middle 
school dreamed of serenade from 
Justin Bieber, the boy who had his 
haircut and wore too much Axe body 
spray in her Spanish class seemed to 
come in a close second.
When I was about to start middle 
school, my parents and I moved to 
Bangalore, India from Ann Arbor. 
Around the same time, my parents 
started to view themselves as the 
more “modern” and “cool” version 
of Asian parents. Therefore, when 
it came to girls, my mother made it 
explicitly known to me that girls 
who were “friends” were completely 
fine with her, but girlfriends were 
strictly off limits. And just like that, 
by allowing me to interact with peo-
ple of the opposite gender, my moth-
er had thought she had made some 
incredible progress to the Asian 
parenting 
model. 
Nevertheless, 
whenever my mother would see me 
hanging out with a girl from school, 
she continued to insist that I told 
her everything about her just so that 
she could go on Facebook a couple of 
hours later and continue her investi-
gation.
Therefore, when I had finally got-
ten a Facebook account in order to 
“keep up with my friends from Ann 
Arbor,” it turned out to be a god-
send for my middle school social life. 
Because whatever game I had lacked 

Loving is 
not easy
Poems for 
the loved 
and lonely

Where Love is Real

There is a place where love is real,

And after hate is concealed,

And there the sky is kind and blue,

And there the grass is jade dew,

And there the robin has a soft coo

To warm in the tomato sun.

Let us leave the place where the ash 

grows white

And the dull sidewalks are steel.

Past the ditch where the tar roses 

bloom

We shall stride with a stride that is lei-

sured with doom,

And gaze where the gray-rust needles 

zoom

To the place where love is real.

Yes, we’ll stride with a stride that is 

leisured with doom,

And we’ll go where the gray-rust nee-

dles zoom,

For the youngsters, they spot, and the 

youngsters, they loom

The place where love is real.

Empty

A heart

Easy to break

Pick yourself up they said

Days dragged on, everyone moved on

How a relationship 
(and a break-
up) taught me to 
accept my body

“Comparison robs you of joy.” It is an 
old adage that I shouldn’t have forgotten 
when I walked away from myself for a 
boy.
As funny and charming as I eventually 
found my first boyfriend, I wasn’t all that 
interested in him when we met over din-
ner with other interns. The music was 
too loud to hear even those across the 
table from me, and I was at the very end, 
only able to speak to a guy whose name 
I couldn’t quite remember or pronounce.
As a nervous talker, I had a compul-
sion to try anyways. I don’t remember 
much about that first conversation, but I 
do know that at one point, I commented 
on his fast metabolism. He was almost 
impossibly skinny, weighing 127 pounds 
even at a height of 5-foot-9-inches. I 
envied that he could eat anything and 
still stay thin because my metabolism 
was completely the opposite: slow and 
seemingly incompatible with being slen-
der.
For most of my life, I’ve struggled with 
my weight. After the tender age of three, 
my BMI often left me solidly in the over-
weight range. I wasn’t the only fat one 
in the family, but I was the only fat girl 
and the only one in my generation to 
remain fat. Though I heard from others 
that Asians were supposedly so lucky to 
be so skinny, I knew that did not apply to 
me. I felt un-Chinese, and ironically, my 
shame was only compounded because I 
had a Chinese family.
Chinese families can be very direct 
to children about their flaws, and my 
family was no different. My father com-
plained about the tightness of the shirt 
I was wearing to church — not because 
it would attract unwanted attention to 
me, but because it would draw notice to 
my belly. The most mortifying of these 
memories took place on one Thanksgiv-
ing, when my entire extended family 
was gathered in my grandparents’ liv-
ing room. My grandmother brought out 
a scale and had me stand on it in front 
of my aunt. She read the results out loud 
and commented on how much weight I’d 
gained —in the same room as the whole 
family.
My father once referred to my figure 
as manly. I’m stocky, made to be wider 
than I’d ever like to be, and it used to 
make me uncomfortable. Through mid-
dle school and even into the beginning 
of high school, hearing others use female 
pronouns to describe me made me feel 
anxious and strange. I didn’t feel femi-
nine, especially as one of the fattest in 
my grade and far from the thin bodies of 
K-pop idols. I didn’t expect to ever look 
like them, but I hoped to at least have a 

shot at being pretty like other Asian girls.
With a mindset like this, being with 
my boyfriend was both comforting and 
horrifying. Though I was often at the 
apartment he shared with a roommate 
and ate the same food that they did, I 
assumed that perhaps he was somehow 
working off the unhealthy portions after 
I had gone home. When I moved in with 
them for a month, I realized that this was 
patently untrue. When his roommate — 
an incredible, somewhat health-oriented 
chef — wasn’t cooking, my boyfriend ate 
like a typical college student, with plenty 
of delivery pizza and always a carton of 
ice cream in the freezer. I tried to keep 
up with him, perhaps out of a misguided 
notion that this would somehow allow us 
to spend more time together, but I even-
tually and ruefully came to terms with 
the fact that I could never eat like he did.
When we broke up, I lost my confi-
dence. It made me feel like I had never 
been good enough for him. There were 
many things he could do that I couldn’t: 
He spoke more languages, programmed 
in more languages, and was so smart that 
he easily got A+s, even with his trade-
mark laziness. But those didn’t really 
bother me all that much. I could easily 
resolve them all with hard work, and 
that’s something that I’m glad I took the 
time to work on. What wouldn’t leave my 
mind was that perhaps he hadn’t wanted 
to continue our long-distance relation-
ship because I wasn’t enough of what he 
wanted. I thought, “If only I were thin-
ner, perhaps he would have been willing 
to persist.” Maybe he had grown embar-
rassed of being with me.
As time passed and our communica-
tion dwindled (for the record, I made 
every attempt to begin a friendship, but 
he chose to ghost me), I grew. After I 
began to counter my feelings with logic, 
I developed a stronger sense of self. From 
my various weight loss attempts, I know 
that looking how I want will take a while, 
but for the first time, I’m happy with 
who I am right now. When I look at the 
mirror, I see someone who is imperfect, 
but beautiful, capable and loved. And 
despite all that this relationship has put 
me through, I’m truthful when I quote 
Ariana Grande and say, “I’m so grateful 

Confessions of a 
of a middle school 
romantic

As long as I can remember, and per-
haps even before, I have been a hopeless 
romantic. I had my first crush on a girl 
when I was three; when I was eight, I 
still had a crush on her and reflected this 
by giving her a pair of earrings that my 
mom helped me make. Her family moved 
away a year later and I was crushed.

By middle school my romanticism had 
reached its peak cringe, a borderline emo 
phase on which I look back and try to 
laugh. In fifth grade, when I was ten, I 
started having a crush on a new girl, and 
being who I am, I wanted to let her know 
in a romantic way. I wrote her a long 
poem and on Valentine’s Day in the year 
two-thousand and nine, ten years ago, I 
snuck the poem into her locker at recess. 
I don’t remember what the poem I wrote 
said, but I do remember the rejection 
poem she put in my locker later that day. 
It read:

Roses are red
Violets are Blue
I’m too young
And so are you
P.S. another time

I think my poem was better. To add to 
my humiliation, I came across her teach-
er in the hallway the following day, who 
congratulated me on writing such a good 
poem.
Despite this rough start to poetry, I 
continued using it as an emotional outlet 
through middle school, and my poems 
were exceptionally bad and cringingly 
melodramatic. In honor of Valentine’s 
Day and for your entertainment, I have 
included an annotated selection of some 
of my middle school poems that related 
to romance. I hope you will enjoy.

Glow
A golden glow
Flows through my body
Warms my heart
And opens my mind

I don’t remember who I wrote this 
about, but it definitely reflects much 
more positive emotion and probably is 
peak Danyel.

Rumor
A terrible infection
That spreads like wildfire
A secret, divulged
A trust, violated
A malignant rumor
Destroying me inside

I’m pretty sure I wrote this poem after 
one of my ‘friends’ told everyone who I 
had a crush on.

Desire
My heart’s desire
Lies in the arms
Of another man
And accounts me every detail
Little does she know
She is eating away
At my soul

At this time, I had a crush on one of my 
best friends, who was ‘dating’ (whatever 
that means in middle school) another 
one of our friends; evidently I was not 
super happy about this.

These are just three of the worst (or 
best entertainment value) from several 
small notebooks’ worth that I wrote 
between 5th-8th grade. To pick these 
out, I went through all of them, and was 
cringing at my past self the entire time. 
Though they make good stories to laugh 
at, as we reflect on the past this Valen-
tine’s Day, I am definitely glad not to be 
in middle school anymore.

To my 4c curls

Dear hair,

Thank you for sticking with me through-
out all the years.
From the hair frying days of high school 
to the box braids that were worn way too 
long.
This is a love letter to you.
I know we’ve had our rough patches, but 
I just didn’t understand your beauty, your 
uniqueness and your power.
The way your 4c curls make you stand 
apart from any other head of limp strands.
The way you absorb coconut oil and 
cantu to make raw power.
The way you continue to grow and shine 
no matter how much relaxer or chemicals 
you get hit with.
Your flexibility and ability to change at 
the drop of the hat. If I wanna try braids, 
you say let’s do it. If I want to wear crochet 
you say girl I’m ready and you make those 
work.
I didn’t appreciate it before but I do now.
I used to think I was treating you well, 
by using the hair products I found in my 
house, using the treatments my mom taught 
me. But then I discovered what sulfates and 
parabens are, and that products for white 
hair are significantly different than prod-
ucts for Black hair. And that just because 
something cleans your hair, it doesn’t mean 
the product is good for your hair.
Now I treat you the way you deserve and 
you show your appreciation through beau-
tifully coiling and growing, the way you 
know how.
I’ve spent too much time not appreciat-
ing you, but I love you hair.
So thank you for sticking through it, and 
always being there.

Love,
Efe
