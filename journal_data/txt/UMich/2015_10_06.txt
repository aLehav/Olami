Service to connect 

students with 

licensed psychologist 

over the phone

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

As 
of 
Monday 
night, 

conversations 
about 
mental 

health 
are 
now 
constantly 

accessible beyond the traditional 
hours offered by Counseling and 
Psychological Services.

Partnering with a company 

called ProtoCall, CAPS will now 
give students the option to call 
a mental health hotline after its 
office in the Michigan Union 
closes at 7 p.m. The hotline will 
be open whenever CAPS is not — 
including weekends and school 
holidays. The phone number 
will be the same number as the 
CAPS main line and will connect 
the caller to a ProtoCall licensed 
psychologist.

According to CAPS director 

Todd Sevig the idea for the 

program has been in the works 
for a few years. He said though 
the University hospital provides 
a psychiatric emergency room 
at all hours, this service could 
help struggling students who 
don’t feel they need to rush to the 
hospital.

“Maybe it’s not quite an 

emergency but it would be 
really helpful to talk with a 
counselor at that moment,” he 
said. “That’s the inspiration. As 
I’ve asked students these last two 
or three years, across the board, 
everybody has said that would be 
really helpful.”

Sevig said the purpose of the 

hotline is to provide a resource 
for students every moment CAPS 
is not open. The phone line will 
not be available when CAPS is 
open, he said, because students 
can access the in-person services 
at those times.

LSA senior Allie Williams, 

a member of CAPS Student 
Advisory Board, said ProtoCall 
has a presence on more than 100 
college campuses and has helped 
more than 2 million students 

Residents with 
disabilities say 
changes don’t go 

far enough

Despite 
recommendations 

from the Pedestrian Safety and 
Access Task Force, the Ann Arbor 

City 
Council 
voted 
Monday 

to retain current regulations 
stipulating the amount of snow 
allowed to build up on sidewalks 
— currently set at one inch.

The 
council 
did 
vote 
to 

give only one warning per 
season before issuing a citation 
for failure to remove snow. 
Previously, residents were given 
a warning per snow event. 
Language will also be eliminated 
that provided “police discretion” 
in issuing snow removal citations. 

Furthermore, while previously 
residents had 24 hours to remove 
snow from sidewalks, there will 
be an 18-hour period before 
residents are issued a warning or 
citation.

The council heard the task 

force’s recommendations during 
a work session on Sept. 14.

After the task force released 

an extensive study on pedestrian 
safety in the city, the authors 
led the council through the 
report and outlined potential 

amendments 
to 
current 

ordinances designed to make 
Ann Arbor a safer city for 
pedestrians.

The ordinance regarding snow 

and ice removal was a particular 
focus for the task force.

In addition to altering the 

policy dictating citations, the 
changes also clarify that property 
owners 
are 
responsible 
for 

clearing snow and ice from bus 
stop and crosswalk approaches.

New initiative 

aims to encourage 
collaboration across 

departments

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

The University is allocating 

more than $5 million to fund a 
new initiative in the humanities.

The funding will provide 

University 
faculty 
members 

working 
in 
the 
humanities 

additional 
opportunities 
to 

collaborate 
across 
University 

departments, the Office of the 
Provost announced last week.

The 
Michigan 
Humanities 

collaboration aims to create 
new 
research 
opportunities 

by funding projects that will 
gather resources from different 
departments. Projects will pull 
largely from the study of human 
culture and thought, including 
language, literature, philosophy, 
history and the arts.

Teams of faculty researchers 

— led by faculty in the humanities 
— will partner with librarians, 
undergraduates, graduate and 
postdoctoral fellows to develop 
new models of research with 
the hope of publishing across 
multiple types of media.

Peggy McCracken, a professor 

of French, women’s studies and 
comparative literature, is acting 
as the collaboratory coordinator.

been proposed, and now that the 
funding has come through we’re

decision to release

Faculty concern over the 

release of course evaluation 
data continues to grow.

After last week’s meeting, 

the Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs received 
an 
e-mail 
invitation 
from 

University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack to appoint a member 
to a task force being formed 
to evaluate the possibility of 

releasing the data. Members 
of student government have 
also been invited to appoint a 
member.

“It’s important that both 

students and faculty have a 
strong voice on this task force 
and are not just decorative 
items,” SACUA Chair Silke-
Maria Weineck, a professor of 
comparative 
literature, 
said 

in an interview following the 
meeting Monday.

At 
last 
week’s 
meeting, 

SACUA 
members 
were 

surprised to learn from James 
Holloway, the vice provost 
for 
Global 
and 
Engaged 

Education, that the University 
was planning to release course 
evaluation data as soon as this 
semester.

Biology 
Prof. 
John 

Lehman, a SACUA member, 
suggested 
constructing 
a 

second committee comprised 
solely 
of 
students, 
faculty 

and survey experts. Lehman 
said the student government 
representatives he has spoken 
to are receptive to faculty 
concerns, and are willing to 
create new evaluation questions 
that better suit faculty and 
student needs.

“There 
are 
no 
students 

who feel as passionately about 
the need for those particular 
questions to be public as to 
the degree of passion that 
was 
expressed 
by 
some 

faculty against it, and that’s 
widely recognized, that’s so 

Expansion builds 
on University’s past 

experience with 

Coursera

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University 
is 
delving 

deeper into the age of digital 
learning with the launch of at 
least 20 new courses on edX, a 
nonprofit massive open online 
course provider, over the next 
two years.

Finance, 
learning 
analytics 

and data science ethics will be the 
topics of three of the first courses.

In a press release, University 

Provost Martha Pollack said 
Monday the announcement is 
evidence 
of 
the 
University’s 

commitment to digital education.

“Michigan is redefining public 

residential education for the 
21st century,” she wrote. “With 
this new partnership we are 
accelerating our experimentation 
in 
digital 
learning 
and 

reaffirming our commitment to 
leadership in learning analytics. 
It’s wonderful to see the growth 
of faculty-led initiatives that 
provide new modes of learning 
and rich opportunity for cutting 
edge scholarship.”

EdX’s chief executive officer, 

Anant 
Agarwal, 
expressed 

similar excitement about the 
University’s decision to partner 
with the organization during a 
recent visit to campus.

“We are honored to welcome 

the University of Michigan to 
edX,” Agarwal said, according 
to a release. “As one of the most 
prestigious 
public 
research 

institutions in the U.S., and a 
pioneer in digital learning and 
learning 
analytics, 
Michigan 

will be an important collaborator 
with edX both in technology and 
research contributions. We are 
delighted to now offer Michigan’s 
highly engaging MOOCs, in a 
wide variety of subject areas, to 
our 5 million edX learners around 
the world.”

EdX was founded in 2012 by 

scientists at Harvard University 
and the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology. The nonprofit’s 
courses are free and available to 
anyone that has Internet access.

This is not the University’s first 

brush with digital education. In 
2012, the University — along with 
the University of Pennsylvania, 
Stanford University, Princeton 
University and two Stanford 
computer science professors — 
co-founded Coursera, a for-profit 
company that offers massive open 
online courses. The University’s 
partnership with Coursera will 
continue.

James Hilton, the vice provost 

for digital education initiatives, 
said edX and Coursera will 
complement each other well.

“EdX and Coursera provide 

very 
different 
models 
with 

different 
sweet 
spots 
for 

experimentation,” he said in a 
release. “We are thrilled that 
our faculty will be able to take 
advantage of both platforms 
to 
push 
the 
boundaries

with mental health needs.

She 
said 
implementing 
a 

ProtoCall hotline on campus will 
help bridge a gap between the 
current services offered and extra 
help students might need.

“CAPS wanted to offer this 

service because they realized 
that there was a need among the 
student body in terms of offering 
alternative resources for mental 
health crises that happen after 
hours, on the weekends or on 
holidays,” she said.

Sevig noted that students will 

never be put on hold through this 
service, and will gain access to 
counselors who know the campus 
and its resources well.

If desired, students will also 

have the option to connect with 
the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center’s 24-hour 
hotline, or with the University 
Hospital.

“They are specifically trained 

in college student mental health, 
and so there are master’s level 
and doctoral level counselors that 
know a lot about college students 

and college student issues,” he 
said. “The second reason why 
this is going to be a great benefit 
for our campus is that they, as 
part of the service they provide, 
take the time to learn not just 
about local resources, but they 
take time to learn the protocols 
that exist within the University. 
So when a student calls they 
will talk to counselor right away 
and that counselor will know all 
about the Michigan resources 
and to connect them with other 
resources if that’s needed.”

Sevig also said through talking 

to students, he has learned 
that some people feel more 
comfortable talking about private 
mental health issues on the phone. 
He hopes this service will add 
value to the face-to-face services 
CAPS already provides.

Williams said she believes the 

hotline can be used not only for 
emergency situations, but also 
for talking through the stressors 
many students face as a result 
of classes or pressure at the 
University.

“An example would be when a 

student is experiencing intense 
anxiety during finals or midterms 
and they’re in the library feeling 

really upset or anxious about the 
exams they have to take,” she 
said. “They could call this line to 
talk through the problems they’re 
having and really receive the help 
that they need.”

Though Sevig said hopes are 

high for the potential of this 
program, he wants to check in 
and evaluate the efficacy of the 
hotline after its launch.

“At 
this 
point, 
what 
I’m 

planning on is an evaluation 
simply in the number of calls and 
the types of calls,” he said. “But 
at some point later in the year I 
would like to talk with students 
and student groups. It could be a 
survey. Then we’ll make changes 
based on that.”

Ultimately, 
Williams 

emphasized that the phone line 
is a strong complement to the 
services CAPS already offers.

“CAPS really wants students 

to live wellness-oriented lives 
and wants to offer this service 
in hopes of serving students that 
need help after regular business 
hours,” she said. “I’d like to think 
that CAPS will continue to strive 
to meet our student mental health 
needs in any way possible.”

DOMINIQUE CANNIS

International interests

ME LODY OF THE FALL 

LSA freshman Dominique 

Cannis does not know how 
to drive, plays music in the 
shower loud enough for the 
entire fourth floor of the Helen 
Newberry Residence to hear 
and, since moving into her 
dorm, has acquired an inter-
est in vacuuming. She has only 
just moved back to the United 
States after spending years 
moving from country to coun-
try as a result of her father’s job 
for Ford Motor Company.

Where have you lived?

I went to high school in 

Moscow, Russia at the Anglo-
American School of Moscow, 
which was an international 

school. From halfway through 
seventh grade to eighth grade, 
I lived in Istanbul. I lived in 
Birmingham, Michigan from 
third grade to halfway through 
seventh grade. I lived in Argen-
tina from kindergarten to third 
grade, and I lived in Venezu-
ela in pre-school. I was born in 
Michigan.

What languages do you 

speak?

I used to speak Spanish flu-

ently — now, because of all the 
moving around, it got really 
messed up, especially when 
I moved back to the States … 
Then, in Istanbul, I didn’t even 
take Spanish for a year — I had 

to take French, which messed 
up my Spanish completely 
because I had to start thinking 
in French. I had a beginner’s 
knowledge of Turkish. I picked 
it up from all of my friends 
because all of my friends were 
Turkish and I really loved 
speaking it. Russian, I never 
really ended up learning.

Where was your favorite 

place to live?

Istanbul I loved, because 

our apartment complex was 
connected to a mall, so I could 
go into the mall whenever I 
wanted. I could just meet up 
with everyone.

Kenan Malik talks 
Muslims in Europe, 

radicalization 

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

For the Daily

Kenan Malik, a lecturer and 

writer, came to the University 
on Monday to discuss a central 
question: what draws thousands 
of Europeans to an organization 
like the Islamic State?

Malik challenged conventional 

thoughts about radicalization and 
deradicalization in his lecture 
called “The Making of European 
Jihadis,” sponsored by the Center 
for European Studies and the 
Islamic Studies Program.

Born in India and raised in 

England, Malik has a background 
in neurobiology and the history 
of the study of science. He has 
recently written “The Quest for a 
Moral Compass: A Global History 
of Ethics” and “From Fatwa to 
Jihad: The Rushide Affair and 
Its Legacy.” Malik runs the blog 

“Pandaemonium” and is also 
known for his broadcasts on BBC 
Radio.

Malik 
began 
his 
lecture 

reflecting on how radicalization 
is often spoken about by reducing 
complexity 
into 
a 
simple 

narrative. He broke the typical 
explanations down into four 
categories.

“First, they claim that people 

become terrorists because they’re 
… usually religiously informed 
of extremist ideas,” Malik said. 
“Secondly, that these ideas are 
acquired in a different way … 
Third, that there’s a conveyor 
belt that leads from grievance 
or personal crisis to religiosity 
to radical beliefs to terrorism. 
And fourth, the insistence that 
what makes people vulnerable 
to acquiring such ideas is that 
they are poorly integrated into 
society.”

According to Malik, there is 

very little evidence to support any 
of these elements of radicalization 
and considerable evidence to 
suggest that all are untrue. He 
believes there is a gap between 

the reality of jihadism and the 
political desire for a simplistic 
narrative that the traditional 
radicalization thesis provides.

Malik said many critics argue 

it is not religion, but politics that 
drive jihadis to terror. However, 
this is a more conventional 
model 
of 
the 
radicalization, 

and Malik said in his opinion, 
both 
explanations 
miss 
the 

specific historical context of 
contemporary 
attraction 
to 

jihadism.

“Those drawn to groups such 

as Islamic State are clearly both 
politically enraged about Western 
intervention and have a particular 
view of Islam — religion and 
politics all indispensable threats 
to their stories,” Malik said.

According to Malik, what drew 

some jihadis to Syria was neither 
politics nor religion, but rather, it 
was a search for something more 
abstract, like a sense of identity 
and meaning. Malik said jihad is 
a form of social disengagement 
rather than radicalization, as it is 
often perceived by the public.

See LECTURE, Page 3


“It is not, in other words, a 

question of being groomed or 
indoctrinated, but of losing faith 
in mainstream moral frameworks 
and searching for an alternative,” 
he said. “Disengagement is, of 
course, not simply a Muslim 
issue. There is today widespread 
disenchantment in the political 
process, 
a 
sense 
of 
being 

politically voiceless.”

Islam 
was 
not 
an 
all-

encompassing 
philosophy 
in 

Malik’s father’s generation, he 
said. The faith of his father’s 
generation 
represented 
a 

relationship with God, not a 
sacrosanct public identity. The 
Muslim identity of today has 
been molded by society and then 
appropriated by Muslims as a 
means for asserting their own 
agency.

“In the past, most Muslims, 

in Britain or in France, would 
have regarded their faith as one 
strand among many,” Malik said. 
“There’s a growing number that 
see themselves as Muslim in an 
almost tribal sense, for whom 
the richness of the tapestry has 
given way to an all-encompassing 
monochrome cloak of faith.”

Common among all the people 

turning to jihadism is their 
distance 
from 
conventional 

Muslim 
traditions 
and 

institutions, Malik said, either 
because they have rejected them, 
or because they have come to 
Islam late in life.

“If we try to explain away 

complexity, it we try to reduce 
complexity to a simple narrative, 
we’re actually explaining away 
the explanation,” Malik said. 
“If we try to craft public policy 
upon a simplistic narrative, it will 
usually be disastrous.”

Karla Mallette, a professor 

of Italian and director of the 
Center for European Studies and 
the Islamic Studies Program, 
introduced Malik to attendees 
as a “rare creature” and public 
intellectual who has a robust 
presence in the public sphere.

“We were looking for somebody 

who 
could 
be 
a 
thoughtful 

and 
intelligent 
correspondent 

to talk to us about the lives of 
Muslims in the UK and really 
throughout 
Europe,” 
Mallette 

said in an interview with the 
Daily. “Kenan Malik was highly 
recommended to us and really 
is one of the most insightful and 
incisive commenters on the lives 
of European Muslims.”

The 
Center 
for 
European 

Studies and the Islamic Studies 
Program are running a series on 
the lives of European Muslims, 
what brings them together and 
how they interact with other 
communities

“What we’re able to do at 

the International Institute is 
to bring people who are from 
other parts of the world to really 
internationalize the University 
community to a lot of people, 
to think through problems that 
are being faced in other parts of 
the world with people who are 
coming directly from that region,” 
Mallette said.

Some speakers representing 

the disabled community of 
Ann Arbor spoke out against 
the ordinance’s amendments, 
saying the changes did not go 
far enough.

“I look at this issue as a human 

decency issue,” said Ann Arbor 
resident Daniel Heumann at the 
meeting. “I’ve lived in weather 
worse than Ann Arbor. I have 
to say after living in Ann Arbor, 
I’ve had the most difficult time 
getting around here than any 
other city.”

Heumann said he felt the 

ordinance was too lenient and 
neglects not just the disabled 
community, but everyone in 
Ann Arbor.

“We need to be a city that 

allows for all of us to be able to 
get around easily,” Heumann 
said. “Despite the fact that 
winter here is sometimes very 
brutal, I think this ordinance 
needs to be reworked in many 
ways.”

Some individuals also felt 

that the suggested ordinance 
violated the Americans with 
Disabilities 
Act 
by 
making 

it more difficult for disabled 
residents to travel about the city.

“I’ve overcome a lot of 

things, but I cannot overcome 
ice and snow,” said Ann Arbor 
resident Ruth Barkan. “During 
the winter I need a walker to 
balance and my walker also 
cannot overcome ice and snow. 
I’m asking you not to pass this 
ordinance, it will make my 
life a lot harder. It is not fair to 

discriminate against some of 
us that have no control over the 
fact that we are disabled.”

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) said 
the ordinance does not violate 
the ADA because all walkways 
and public sidewalks must be 
cleared.

The 
current 
ordinance 

requires one inch of snow to be 
accumulated before residents 
are required to remove it.

The suggestion from the task 

force, which was not approved 
by Council, specified that snow 
of greater than one inch and any 
compacted snow of greater than 
a half inch must be removed. 
However, an amendment to 
the 
proposal 
removed 
the 

specifications about compacted 
snow because councilmembers 
felt 
it 
over-complicated 

enforcement.

“We can’t get compliance 

with the one inch, so until we 
can get that, it’s going to be 
very difficult to get compliance 
on the zero,” Councilmember 
Sabra Briere (D–Ward 1) said.

Several speakers said that 

Ann Arbor is one of the only 
cities where a zero-tolerance 
rule is not enforced.

Councilmember 
Kirk 

Westphal (D–Ward 2) said he 
was grappling with how to 
change the ordinance to please 
the concerns of all residents.

“We’re reportedly an outlier 

in the way we allow snow on 
our walkways,” Westphal said. 
“I think we have the ability 
and willingness to get to a 
place where we accommodate a 
greater variety of users.”

The City Council also voted 

on a resolution to approve 
the 
Council 
Administration 

Committee to act as a search 
committee for a new city 
administrator.

In 
previous 
years, 
the 

process of selecting a new city 
administrator depended less on 
the Administration Committee 
and more on smaller search 
parties. However, in alliance 
with the Open Meetings Act, 
which states that meetings of 
certain public bodies must be 
open to the public, the process 
changed.

According to Briere, the 

committee gave recommended 
some candidates in years past, 
but it was up to Council to 
narrow down their options in a 
public forum.

“The 
challenge 
here 
is 

how to involve us all without 
having a meeting in public 
that embarrasses a candidate 
because we don’t choose that 
candidate to be considered for 
the next phase,” Briere said.

In 
August, 
Current 
City 

Administrator 
Steve 
Powers 

announced 
he 
was 
leaving 

the position. After spending 
four years in the position, 
he is accepting a new career 
opportunity in Oregon and 
leaving 
in 
November. 
The 

Council has appointed Tom 
Crawford, 
the 
city’s 
chief 

financial officer, as an interim 
city administrator while the 
search process is completed.

While 
the 
Council 
will 

select and approve the city 
administrator when the time 
comes, the committee will serve 
as a search committee for three 
finalists suitable for the role.

getting under way,” she said.

The 
$5 
million 
University 

investment 
will 
support 
the 

project for a projected four years. 
Depending on the initiative’s 
success, a potential renewal for 
another three years would double 
the amount to $10 million.

Sara Blair, vice provost for 

academic and faculty affairs and 
professor of English, said the first 
task for the advisory board would 
be developing criteria for project 
proposals and guide interested 
faculty toward applying.

“The advisory board will be 

looking for projects that make 
imaginative use of collaborative 
teams, 
are 
thoughtful 
about 

research and mentoring across 
faculty, graduate student and 
undergraduate roles, and ready to 
experiment with alternative ways 
of getting humanities research 
out to our many publics,” she said.

Because preliminary deadlines 

for 
project 
proposals 
are 

approaching, 
McCracken 
said 

she’s working with her staff to 
quickly prepare the criteria before 
the first deadlines in February.

“I’ve heard from a number of 

people,” she said. “I think there’s 
a lot of interest. And I’m excited 
about that.”

McCracken’s team will also 

work to provide a series of 
workshops about how to craft 
project programs in advance of 
the deadline.

The workshops will detail 

successful examples of research 
proposals 
to 
help 
faculty 

structure their own requests. 
They will also provide tips on 
successfully 
incorporating 

student involvement in projects.

Participants 
in 
the 

collaborative will be selected 
by a faculty board composed of 
Sidonie Smith, director of the 
Institute for the Humanities; 

associate deans for humanities 
in LSA and Rackham Graduate 
School; and any additional faculty 
selected by the coordinator.

Though there are no guidelines 

in place yet, Smith said an 
important aspect of projects 
contending for funding is their 
method of reaching the public 
with their results.

“Part of the requirements is the 

results of the collaboration need 
to be made available in multiple 
formats for different audiences,” 
Smith said.

While the research may end 

up appearing in either a book 
or essay format, Smith said the 
expectation is that the results will 
be communicated through public 
events or multimedia platforms.

Smith 
said 
the 
projects 

would 
not 
preempt 
a 
new 

interdisciplinary 
program 
or 

result in any rearrangements of 
departmental structures.

“They will not be tied to 

establishing 
some 
kind 
of 

institutional 
program,” 
she 

said. 
“They’re 
meant 
to 
be 

pop-up — that is, they arrived 
from faculty interest. They’re 
not tied to a long-term agenda. 
They are for enabling faculty to 
have the opportunity to work in 
collaborative teams and to train 
doctoral students in this new kind 
of environment for doing work in 
the humanities.”

The 
collaborative 
efforts 

will 
be 
strategically 
housed 

at Hatcher Graduate Library 
to allow the projects access to 
research resources as well as 
public exposure.

“Being in the library, a hub of 

humanities research, will allow 
for collaboration with librarians, 
information specialists and other 
humanists, and make the work 
of the collaboratory visible to the 
campus and community,” Blair 
said.

Selected projects will begin in 

the fall of 2016.

discovery.”

Finance 
Prof. 
Gautam 

Kaul will teach “Finance for 
Everyone: 
Smart 
Tools 
for 

Decision-Making.” As one of 
the first professors to pilot 
Coursera, he created his first 
MOOC three years ago.

Timothy McKay, a professor 

of 
physics 
and 
astronomy, 

will teach a new learning 
analytics course as a part of the 
University’s new partnership 
with edX.

McKay 
said 
the 
new 

partnership 
will 
allow 
the 

University to further personalize 
education.

“At 
U-M 
we 
believe 

personalization 
at 
scale 
is 

within reach. We care deeply 
about 
enriching 
the 
lives 

of learners on campus and 
around the world” McKay said. 
“With edX we will continue 
to employ personalization and 
learning analytics to improve 
the effectiveness of student 
learning, our teaching and the 
design of courses and curricula.”

H. V. Jagadish, a professor 

of electrical engineering and 
computer science, will teach 
the third course about data 
science ethics.

Comparative Literature Prof. 

Silke-Maria Weineck, chair of 
the Senate Advisory Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs, 
said 

the University’s move toward 
digital education is something 
SACUA has yet to cover.

“We have not had a chance to 

discuss this at SACUA so I can’t 
speak to this,” she said. “But as 
with all technical innovations, 
there’s always great potential 
and great risks.”

James DeVaney, the associate 

vice provost for digital education 
and 
innovation, 
said 
the 

University’s decision to expand 
its digital education system will 
have an international impact.

“Anchoring our scholarly and 

practical approach in digital 
learning and learning analytics, 
we’ve 
reached 
3.6 
million 

lifelong 
learners 
through 

MOOCs since 2012, and have 
created the infrastructure and 
capacity to partner with faculty 
innovators 
to 
dramatically 

increase Michigan’s impact,” 
DeVaney wrote in a release. “If 
we continue to harness the best 
technology and deepen our use 
of learning analytics, we know 
the ripple effect of Michigan’s 
academic excellence and alumni 
network will be felt around the 
world.”

Farmer discovers 
mammoth, donates 
it to the University

The farmer who found wooly 

mammoth bones on his property 
in Washtenaw County donated 
the specimen to the University on 
Monday.

Last week John Bristle was 

digging in his soy-bean field when 
he discovered the unusual bones. 
What he first mistook as a fence 
turned out to be a rib bone. When 
Bristle realized the magnitude 
of his discovery he contacted 
the University and Dan Fisher, 
director 
of 
the 
University’s 

Museum of Paleontology and 
professor.

Fisher said Bristle’s mammoth 

discovery is in the top ten most 
significant mammoth discoveries 
in Michigan’s recorded history.

University researchers believe 

the 
mammoth 
lived 
around 

11,700 and 15,000 years ago. They 
hypothesize that it may have been 
killed by early hunters based 
on the placement of the bones 
and their discovery of what they 
believe could be a cutting tool.

Researchers aim to 
get children moving 
in the classroom

University 
researchers 

are working to curb obesity 
and 
keep 
students 
focused 

through implementing periodic 
two 
minute 
exercise 
breaks 

throughout the day in elementary 
and middle school classrooms.

Rebecca 
Hasson, 
assistant 

professor 
in 
the 
School 
of 

Kinesiology, is leading the Active 
Classroom project which gives 
students two minute exercise 
breaks between every twenty 
minutes of classwork.

Hasson found students burn on 

average 100 — 300 more calories 
with the exercise program than 
they would have in a typical 
classroom setting. Her research 
also shows students are able to 
quickly resume focusing on their 
school work after the break and 
none of the participants in her 
study complained about having 
to exercise.

As 
Hasson 
continues 
her 

research she hopes to quantify 
the effect the breaks have on 
kids’ ability to maintain a healthy 
weight and improve cognition.

University debuts 
training program

On Monday the University 

launched Navigate: Fundamen-
tals — a course to train incoming 
research administrators.

The program involves eight 

day long conferences where 
guest speakers will present their 
research. The course will run 
October through March.

The course was developed 

after the research administra-
tion advisory council subcom-
mittee for mentoring research 
administrators and training new 
ones conducted a survey in 2013 
gathering input on what would 
make a good course.

Navigate will prepare the 

incoming administrators on how 
to respond in various profession-
al situations and how to manage 
a research project.

clear,” Lehman said. “There’s 
no coalition more important 
at a University than between 
the faculty and the students. 
And any time you have the 
opportunity to demonstrate that, 
you demonstrate it.”

Ultimately, 
the 
committee 

decided it would be too confusing 
to implement a second task force.

“The sense of most people 

in the room was we are totally 
in favor of students and faculty 
working together on this, but we 
are already asking for this, and 
now to have a separate version 
would 
muddy 
the 
waters,” 

Weineck said after the meeting.

SACUA 
members 
also 

discussed University President 
Mark Schlissel’s decision to 
continue to publicly release only 

the base salaries of University 
faculty, 
administration 

and 
staff 
members. 
His 

announcement follows a review 
of the University’s compensation 
practices by the institution’s 
human resources office and a 
private consulting firm.

“This feels right to me 

in 
striking 
the 
balance 

between 
continuing 
our 

competitive edge for the best 
administrative talent and being 
fiscally responsible, especially 
given the scale and complexity 
at Michigan,” Schlissel said in 
a statement.

The review, which looked at 

executive compensation levels, 
the use of non-base pay and 
practices on public disclosure of 
compensation for all employees, 
found 
compensation 
for 

executives at the University 
ranks high in comparison to peer 
public institutions and falls in 

the median when compared with 
private peer institutions.

Under Michigan state law, the 

University is required to release 
base salaries, but not total 
compensation, which includes 
bonuses.

Weineck said faculty members 

were hoping the University 
would decide to release the full 
compensation data, but have 
decided not to pursue the matter 
now that Schlissel has made his 
decision.

“There 
was 
a 
general 

consensus among many faculty 
that they would like the actual 
compensation data to be released, 
not just the base salaries because 
that can paint a misleading 
picture,” she said. “We had hope 
that this was an ethical decision 
and the ethical decision was to be 
transparent. We’re disappointed 
but we’re not contemplating any 
further action.”

A sobering experience

O

nce, 
during 
Welcome 

Week of freshman year, 
I slept in a bramble patch 

outside the Cen-
tral 
Campus 

Recreational 
Building. It was 
2 a.m., and I was 
walking 
home 

with my friend. 
“I’ll 
be 
right 

back,” I said, wan-
dering into the 
bramble 
patch. 

“Don’t leave.” 

He did leave 

— thanks, Greg — 
but to be fair, I was already asleep in 
a fucking bush. It was the beginning 
of the tradition of me falling asleep in 
places that are neither comfortable 
nor appropriate.

Sophomore year, I went on a 

camping trip with some friends. One 
night, after just two hard ciders, I 
climbed into a canoe and pushed 
myself away from shore. “So long, 
assholes,” I yelled at my friends. “I’m 
fucking Pocahontas.” Except that I 
didn’t have a paddle, and my friend 
Kenny had to swim to the middle of 
the lake and tow me in.

So when I came home last week 

to find some kid sleeping in a chair 
on my lawn, I tried to be forgiving. 
I walked right by him and into the 
house. It was 7 p.m. on a Monday. I’m 
not Mother Theresa, and I was too 
busy for that shit.

I asked Kenny if he saw the kid in 

our yard — apparently Kenny found 
him on the street.

“He was gonna get MIP’ed,” 

Kenny said, making coffee. “You’ve 
been there.”

Kenny was always taking in strays. 

He has a natural social instinct that 
I don’t — not that there’s anything 
wrong with chatting with strangers. 
It’s just not for everyone, in the same 
way that autoflagellation isn’t for 
everyone. Or pulling teeth.

We went outside and checked on 

him. Kenny asked where he lived. 
“Close,” he slurred, over and over. 
“Real close.” That didn’t do much 
for us, but we each took an arm and 
started walking in the direction he 
pointed us. “Just over there,” he said. 
“Real close.”

Ten minutes into the walk, I started 

doubting his understanding of “close.”

Kenny and the kid were getting 

along splendidly, though. He wouldn’t 
tell us his name — pretty shy for a guy 
we let sleep on our lawn — but he was a 
senior at the University. He liked craft 
beer and the Seattle Seahawks.

“What were you drinking tonight, 

buddy?” Kenny asked.

“I wasn’t drinking,” he said.
He wouldn’t tell us what he was 

on — that didn’t bother Kenny and 
I, though. College kids experiment. 
So what.

I don’t want to exoticize hard drug 

use. (That? Here?) Nor do I want to 
broadcast the suffering of one young 
man — if you’re out there, I’m sorry. 
But when we talked it seemed like 
you had a lot to say. And I think your 
story is important.

We sat him down in Burns Park 

around 8 p.m. — he was basically dead 
weight at this point. He could hardly 
keep his eyes open, but he kept telling 
us the story. It sounded rehearsed, as 
if he’d been over it in his head before 
he had someone to listen.

“I tried it three years ago. I was 

just looking for something. I think it 
really started when I started smok-
ing, though. I started smoking when 
I was 14. And I was high all the time. 
I think because I started so young I 
don’t know how not to be high. So 
then I was on pills. My doctor said it 
was OK, you know? Because I have 
anxiety. But I think I have anxi-
ety because of the smoking. I don’t 
know. It gets harder to find that thing 
you’re looking for,” he said. “It gets to 
this point where you don’t even know 
what it was in the first place. You 
don’t know what you ever were look-
ing for. But I was doing really well, 

with this — I haven’t used in three 
weeks, did you know that?”

We were sitting on a bench and 

some kids were playing on the play-
ground not far from us. It struck 
me, as I grabbed the guy to keep him 
from falling forward, that this was 
the closest I’d ever been to a hard 
drug addict. He looked a little like 
me, actually.

It was dark. He was falling asleep 

on Kenny’s shoulder. Out of options, 
we took his phone and started calling 
numbers. “No way,” said the voice over 
the phone. “I can’t deal with his shit 
today. Tell him to call someone else.”

Another friend did come — “I have 

someone important in the car. Don’t 
fuck this up for me, man,” he said.

We helped him into the car. As we 

closed the door, he grabbed Kenny by 
the shoulder.

“Don’t ever do prescription pills,” 

he said. “It only leads to heroin.”

It was 9:30 p.m. Kenny and I had 

a bowling game in 20 minutes. Our 
housemates would be mixing drinks 
— everyone drinks heavily on bowl-
ing night. For me, it’s the only way I 
can deal with my utter lack of talent. 
If we hurried, we could make it back 
to the house in time to play catch-up 
with a few shots. But we stayed on 
the bench a little longer. All the kids 
had gone home.

“I thought he was just drunk,” 

Kenny said. 

Would it have been better if he was 

just plain, old-fashioned fucked up? I 
don’t know if one sort of fucked up 
is better than another. He was using 
heroin for the same reasons a lot of 
us drink, anyway: to feel comfortable 
or relaxed. The difference is campus 
culture allows one sort of passing out 
and not the other.

We bowled sober — for that night, 

at least. I’m sure we’ll be back in the 
partying mood soon. But Kenny’s 
been staying in a bit more. So have I.

I 

don’t identify as American. But I also 
definitely don’t identify as German. 
Having been raised by immigrant par-

ents, I’m pretty staunch 
in my view of myself as a 
German-American, and, for 
better or for worse, I know 
I will never belong either 
here or there. However, this 
gives me an irreplaceable 
advantage over any Ameri-
can-American.

My parents immigrated 

to the United States in 1994. 
Both of my older sisters 
were born in Germany, but 
I was born on U.S. soil, with 
both the citizenship of my parents’ country 
and this new one. Unlike the rest of my fam-
ily, I could be president. We actually were only 
supposed to live in the United States for three 
years, so my parents named me after an actor 
in popular American films at the time, Liam 
Neeson, so they could show off my Ameri-
can birthplace when I lived in Germany. They 
ended up staying, though, so I actually have a 
name that does the opposite of what my parents 
intended. Instead of standing out, I blend in. 
An interesting relationship can often develop 
between the children of immigrants and their 
parents. Looking back, it’s actually bizarre how 
much cultural authority I had over them. As a 
native to the language of the United States, I 
had valuable skills and knowledge that neither 
my mother nor even my engineer/businessman 
father had. My family turned to me for advice 
on grammar, spelling, vocabulary and other 
references not understood by non-Americans.

I still can remember being absolutely 

ashamed when my mom would come pick me 
up from kindergarten (a word I hadn’t realized 
was German) and speak our native language 
with me. I was so embarrassed. For play dates, 
I would always prefer going over to my friends’ 
houses, with their easily-chewed American 
foods (my dad always says our hard German 
bread is “gut für die Zähne,” or good for your 
teeth) and parents without accents. Instead of 
pronouncing my last name the correct way, I 
would introduce myself phonetically as “Liam 
Weez-en-burger.” My sister recently told me 
the story of how she found out she was an immi-
grant, in which, after seeing the other kinder-
garten students’ PB&J sandwiches, Cheetos 
and Gushers at lunch time, she realized maybe 
these other kids actually don’t all have a differ-
ent secret family language they speak at home.

As I grew older and began to appreciate my 

heritage and culture, it was finally time for me 
to begin asking my parents about their home 
country. I, of course, went through a phase in 
which I thought Germany was the best thing 
since sliced Bauernbrot, and relished in bring-
ing my background into any conversation I 
could, citing how much more advanced and 
progressive my parents’ home country was than 
America. Now, however, I believe I’ve struck 
a healthy balance with which I can appreciate 
both the positive and negative aspects of each 
of my countries.

A phenomenon I find fascinating is that, 

from what I have noticed, many first-generation 
Americans gravitate toward their own kind in 
college. By that, I mean many first-generation 
friends of mine from high school whose social 
circles consisted of a wide variety of ethnicities 
and nationalities find a place in college with 
other first-generation Americans with parents 
from the same region. And I’m no exception! I 
too have surrounded myself almost exclusively 
with other first-generation students. The only 
difference with me is that I happened to become 
part of a community whose parents came from 
a different country than mine. Despite being 
German, I feel very much at home in Michigan’s 
Indian-American dance community. In my 
opinion, it’s not the region of origin that causes 
first-generation students to be extremely driv-
en, open-minded, optimistic and motivated. 
The experience of growing up with immigrant 
parents often results in individuals that have 
dealt with issues their native peers have not, 
and so needed to develop the skills necessary to 
overcome potential disadvantages. Immigrant 
parents are also often very motivating. That is, 
they know what they came to this country for, 
and instill high expectations in their children.

My American peers probably have never had 

a kid turn around and yell, “SPEAK ENGLISH” 
to them on a ski lift, or never have to take over 
the phone because their mom is on the verge 
of tears from being treated rudely by customer 
service for her accent and English skills. But 
they also probably didn’t grow up bilingual, 
international and with an innate understand-
ing of cultural self-awareness. Being a first-
generation American is an absolute blessing as 
a university student, and my split cultural iden-
tity is something of which I am fiercely proud. 
Immigrant parents may struggle with raising 
their children in a country originally foreign to 
them, but it’s a price that comes with an irre-
placeable reward.

C

olumbine, 
Virginia 

Tech, Newtown, Aurora, 
Charleston and Umpqua 

were merely a list 
of names years 
ago — a grouping 
of cities, schools 
and places with 
seemingly 
little 

significance 
to 
the 
outside 

world. Now, as 
our 
generation 

and 
subsequent 

generations con-
tinue to grow up 
in a culture with 
a high frequency of mass shootings 
and gun violence, these names stand 
as reminders of a bleak history of vio-
lence, tragedy and humanity’s ability 
to inflict devastating harm upon itself. 
They stand as memorials of cherished 
lives taken away too soon.

I remember, as a middle school 

student, watching the unceasing 
news coverage of the Virginia Tech 
shooting. My parents undertook the 
difficult task of explaining what was 
going on. A little more than one year 
later, during the summer of 2008, my 
hometown’s name tragically gained 
significance as another site where 
innocent young lives were taken by 
a shooter. I was too young to know 
the individuals personally. Rather, 
I knew them solely through con-
nections made only in small towns 
where everybody somehow knows 
everyone. Even with the greatest 
amount of empathy and compassion, 
I’ll never be able to fully understand 
the terror, the grief or the magnitude 
of loss felt by the parents, friends and 
classmates of the teenagers lost that 
summer day. I can only attest to the 
shock, fear and collective mourning 
felt by a community left wondering: 
How, of all places, could this happen 
in a small town in the middle of the 
woods? How could this happen here?

Tragedy, as citizens of Umpqua, 

Ore. — preceded by countless com-
munities before them — will learn, 
leaves an indelible mark that remains 
after the last headlines have gone 
to print, after the final condolence 
has been given, after the cameras 
disappear and the resulting policy 
debates stagnate. Shock and devasta-
tion mend and transition over time 
to somber mourning and finally to 

memorialization 
and 
acceptance. 

While the memory of these tragedies 
may dampen with each passing year 
as the world moves onward, it never 
truly fades in the minds of the families, 
friends and communities affected.

Yet, as the public could see from 

the frustration and aggravation 
President Barack Obama showed in 
his address this past Thursday, soci-
ety isn’t moving onward after these 
tragedies. Instead, after each succes-
sive traumatic instance, we enter the 
same cyclical path of tragedy, media 
coverage, unproductive debate and 
impasse, repeating it every few 
weeks or months.

Whether these tragedies happen 

on a wide scale, whether they capture 
national media attention or even just 
the attention of a region or whether 
these incidents are more isolated, the 
frequency of gun-related violence in 
the United States is alarming. Thurs-
day marked Obama’s 15th address 
regarding mass shootings during his 
time in office. According to the BBC, 
the number of mass shootings this 
year in the United States, including 
the events that took place in Oregon, 
increased to 294. The rate of deaths 
resulting from gunshots each year 
currently stands at 30,000.

Our country, without a doubt, 

needs reform in order to reduce the 
epidemic of gun violence. To do so, 
we, as a society, need to change the 
way we approach these incidents. Far 
too often in the aftermath, all that 
results is simplistically labeling it an 
issue of gun control, which usually 
leads to an unproductive, escalated 
brawl of partisanship. Our govern-
ment does need to reevaluate our 
laws and consider stronger regula-
tion. It’s also important to acknowl-
edge that regulation and confiscation 
are in no way synonymous. In fact, 
conducting background checks for 
all individuals who purchase a gun 
is an initiative supported by roughly 
90 percent of Americans. Likewise, 
there’s evidence that enacting back-
ground checks and permit-to-pur-
chase laws in some states has aided 
in reducing gun-related violence.

But gun control — even though 

media outlets and politicians cer-
tainly center upon the issue — will 
not offer the ultimate resolution to 
this serious problem. Rather, the 
media itself presents another issue 

entirely. Coverage tends to focus 
heavily upon the motivations of the 
shooter to an extent to which the 
name of the shooter is often more 
recognizable than the names of the 
victims. Some argue the sensational-
ist style and continuous coverage is 
capable of a contagion effect, which 
may appeal to those seeking infamy 
and contribute to continuing the 
trend of increased gun violence.

We watch news of these events 

unfold, seeking to know the motiva-
tions behind a perpetrator’s actions 
and usually attributing them to 
issues of mental health, a violent 
culture, hatred, sexism, racism or 
other societal problems. In order to 
reduce the frequency of these events, 
though, more time also needs to be 
devoted to analyzing and remedy-
ing underlying issues. Society can’t 
expect gun violence and mass shoot-
ings to be eliminated by a few laws 
in a culture where issues of mental 
health, prejudice and inequality are 
still frequently overlooked.

We can’t begin to solve a problem 

we still don’t fully understand. With 
numerous potential factors to con-
sider, our lack of conclusive answers 
and information about gun violence 
is highly problematic and illustrates 
a dire need for research. Barriers, 
such as bans, against gun-violence 
research have been imposed and 
lifted in recent years. Yet, limits on 
funding and concerns over reignit-
ing polarizing debates still continue 
to inhibit organizations like the CDC 
from researching gun violence and its 
contributing factors further.

Simplistic answers and stagnant 

debates aren’t the solution to this 
multi-faceted problem of violence. 
In his address last Thursday, Obama 
stressed that after these horrific 
acts, supplying “our thoughts and 
our prayers” is not enough to dis-
rupt this pattern. Our words, no 
matter how heartfelt and genuine, 
must begin to coincide with our 
actions, and we, as a society, need to 
both thoughtfully consider and look 
beyond the divisive, complicated 
debate over gun control. Until we 
look deeper and analyze all of the 
potential contributing factors, our 
response still won’t be “enough.”

‘Other People’ will 
keep you chuckling

IFC FILMS

Pete Campbell wouldn’t wear flannel.

Indie rom-com 
overcomes genre 
conventions with 

great jokes

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

Nowadays, practically every 

romantic comedy is labeled 
“predictable” or “formulaic.” 
Movies 
like 

“Trainwreck,” 
though, 
have 

conclusively 
shown us that 
predictability 
isn’t necessar-
ily a bad thing 
when it comes 
to this genre. A 
good old-fash-
ioned romance 
story can be 
pleasing in its familiarity, and 
often 
the 
“unconventional” 

ending is simply the wrong 
ending for a given story. Writ-
er-director Leslye Headland’s 
(“Bachelorette”) new rom-com, 
“Sleeping with Other People,” 
does fall back on some of the 
same conventions of the genre, 
but with some great jokes, a 
great cast and a few surprising 
touches, the movie succeeds at 
overcoming those pitfalls.

Jason Sudeikis (“Saturday 

Night Live”) and Alison Brie 
(“Community”) star as Jake 
and Lainey, two people who 
lost their virginity to one other. 
When Jake and Lainey run into 
each other at a sex addiction 
support group years later, they 
ignore their mutual attraction, 
and instead strike up a friend-
ship based on the idea that sex 
ruins every relationship they 
have been in.

It’s a pretty silly premise, 

and it calls to mind the count-
less other rom-coms based on 
characters trying and failing to 

remain “just friends.” But the 
movie is surprising in its hon-
esty. This isn’t building toward 
a revelation when the charac-
ters will realize their insecu-
rities. From the beginning, it’s 
clear that Jake is a womanizer 
because he’s too afraid to actu-
ally make a lasting connec-
tion with anyone, and Lainey 
is hung up on her engaged ex, 
Matthew (Adam Scott, “Parks 
and Recreation”). Neither of 
these conflicts seem particu-
larly fresh, but it does feel fresh 
how openly and honestly the 
characters work through their 
issues together. Jake and Lain-
ey discuss sex positions, female 
ejaculation, penis size and mas-
turbation, and their candor is 
both hilarious and refreshing.

Even if the beats of the story 

are mostly typical, there are 
little touches in the direction, 
script and acting. After Lainey 
has a surprisingly humiliating 
sexual experience, she lies back 
on the table and a ray of sunlight 
filters into the room, lingering 
for several seconds as she stews 
in self-loathing. As Jake delivers 
joke after hilarious joke, Lainey 
giggles in the background. And 
in one scene that will make you 
fall for Alison Brie (if you some-
how haven’t already), Lainey 
teaches a group of kids at a 
birthday party how to dance.

At different points in the 

movie, the predictability of 
the ending shifts. As Jake and 
Lainey’s sexual tension builds 
and the two show clear signs 
of falling in love, it seems obvi-
ous that they’ll end up together. 

But as Headland cultivates her 
trope-subverting style with her 
naturalistic direction and well-
written honesty, the possibil-
ity of an unconventional ending 
becomes more real. At one point 
about an hour into the movie, 
the story reaches an unexpected 
note of peace and acceptance, 
with the characters content in 
their platonic roles. In that one 
quiet moment as Jake and Lainey 
lie together and fall asleep, all 
the conflict falls away and the 
viewer gets the distinct feel-
ing that it doesn’t really matter 
whether the characters do get 
together.

Unfortunately, 
the 
movie 

brings back the conflict in a 
somewhat 
unnecessary 
third 

act, shattering the sense of con-
tentment by again raising the 
question of whether these char-
acters belong together. For many 
viewers, Headland’s small sam-
ple of stylistic touches will be 
enough to overcome the inher-
ent predictability of the genre. 
But it’s hard not to wish the film 
would be OK with stopping a 
little earlier and leaving things a 
little ambiguous. By the time the 
movie does resolve the will-they-
won’t-they conflict, it feels a lit-
tle false. The answer just doesn’t 
seem to matter as much as it did 
earlier on.

“Sleeping with Other People” 

doesn’t reinvent the romantic 
comedy like it sometimes aspires 
to, but that’s OK. With a support-
ing cast stacked with hilarious 
comedic actors including Jason 
Mantzoukas 
(“The 
League”), 

Andrea Savage (“Step Brothers”) 
and Natasha Lyonne (“Orange is 
the New Black”), and a compel-
ling pair of leads in Sudeikis and 
Brie, it succeeds in investing the 
audience in its conflict. By the 
time it ends, some of that invest-
ment has dwindled, but it’s still 
an admirable entry into the rom-
com genre. When the laughs are 
constantly rolling, it’s hard to 
ask for much more.

TV REVIEW
Not yet Trevor’s show

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

Reviewing late night shows right 

after they premiere is a difficult 
task because they, more than any 
other 
type 
of 

television, 
take 

time 
to 
grow 

into their own. 
Even the most 
talented 
hosts 

have 
early 

bumps 
in 
the 

road. It’s hard to 
be too critical on 
someone who’s 
just 
starting 

and isn’t used 
to this format 
yet. 
Despite 

all this, there 
were 
moments 

in the first week of the new “The 
Daily Show” where Trevor Noah 
looked actively uncomfortable. His 
delivery was off, and some of his 
work didn’t have the sharp wit that 
landed him the prestigious position 
of replacing Jon Stewart. However, 
there were some bright spots in the 
week. With time, Noah should be 
able to take what worked, improve 

what didn’t and spin the show 
in a direction where he is more 
comfortable.

The format of the new “The Daily 

Show” remains the same: Noah tells 
jokes at his desk, both on his own 
and with the correspondents; there 
are field pieces and an interview 
in each episode’s third act. Of the 
desk segments in the premiere 
week, only a handful worked, with 
the best ones occurring when 
Noah let his own voice shine. For 
example, Thursday’s show opener, 
where Noah compared Trump to 
an African dictator, showcased 
Noah’s biting humor and his 
global perspective (Noah grew 
up in apartheid South Africa). 
However, the entire week wasn’t 
as impressive — a segment on racist 
police by correspondents Jordan 
Klepper and Roy Wood Jr. lingered 
for about twice as long as it should 
have.

Noah’s biggest weakness in the 

first week of shows came during 
the interviews, where he seemed 
nervous asking questions and 
couldn’t flesh out substance in the 
conversations. This was prevalent 
during his interview with New 
Jersey Governor Chris Christie. 

While Noah tried to guide the 
conversation in a more serious 
direction, he couldn’t negotiate 
with Christie’s evasiveness. The 
rest of the week’s interviews were 
less substantive, with celebrities 
and CEOs with whom Noah was 
a bit more relaxed. The one new 
benefit of Noah’s show is that 
there will be more music on it, 
something that was lacking during 
Stewart’s 
tenure. 
Thursday’s 

episode had Ryan Adams as a 
musical guest; he played three 
songs off his Taylor Swift cover 
album 1989.

The 
moment 
most 

representative of Noah’s timidity 
in the chair was when he 
addressed the community college 
shooting in Oregon. He gave a 
heartfelt statement, expressing 
his condolences for the victims, 
but he didn’t quite go as far as Jon 
Stewart would have. If it weren’t 
his first week, maybe he would 
have given more of a commentary 
or expressed more of his personal 
views than he did. What’s nice 
about the late night format is that 
Noah will have several months 
to find his voice and establish 
himself in the host chair.

That Mars problem took two years to solve.
Innovative ‘Martian’ 
explores humanity

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

The 
concept 
of 
space 

is 
terrifying. 
It’s 
a 
place 

completely hostile to human 
life, a place 
where we’re 
not 
meant 

to 
survive. 

To go into 
space, 
in 

several ways, 
is to defy the 
laws of the 
universe. 
Yet, 
for 

many, there’s 
an 
endless 

allure to visiting the vastness 
beyond our planet — the 
challenge to push mankind’s 
collective ingenuity, to test 
the boundaries of possibility 
and to achieve unmatched 
greatness continues to drive 
humanity 
forward. 
“The 

Martian” 
weaves 
together 

these 
two 
contrasting 

human needs, to endure and 
to explore, into a tale where 
survival depends on doing the 
unprecedented.

At the center is astronaut 

Mark Watney (Matt Damon, 
“Interstellar”). A botanist for 
the Ares III mission on Mars, 
Watney 
is 
presumed 
dead 

and abandoned by his fellow 
crewmembers after a freak 
storm forces an evacuation. 
Alone, Watney must live on a 
foreign world where even the 
smallest mistake can lead to 
his death.

Directed by Ridley Scott 

(“Prometheus”), who makes 
one of his best efforts in years, 
“The Martian” bears resem-
blance to Ron Howard’s “Apol-
lo 13.” In this similarity lies 
one of “The Martian” ’s biggest 
challenges: while the crisis of 
“Apollo 13” took place over a 
roughly six-day period, “The 
Martian” has the task of tell-
ing a narrative that extends 
over 500 days. To maintain 
the life-or-death tension over 
such a prolonged period of 
time, screenwriter Drew God-
dard (“Cabin in the Woods”) 
splits the story into two parts, 
emphasizing 
two 
distinct 

questions — how Watney will 
survive and how he will get 
home.

The first question forms 

the beginning of the movie as 
Watney comes to grips with 
his situation. The weight of 
the movie is largely thrust 
on Damon as the isolated 
astronaut, and he’s more than 
up to the task. With a measured 
determination and smirking 
gallows humor, Damon brings 
lightness to Watney’s grim 
task while delivering the stress 
and doubt that crawl into the 
man’s psyche as he faces such 
insurmountable obstacles.

“The 
Martian” 
embraces 

ingenuity as Watney uses his 
limited resources to create a 
small potato farm. To explain 
Watney’s technical method, 
Scott interweaves narration 
and 
image. 
Using 
video 

journals, 
Damon 
narrates 

his character’s progress as 
he fertilizes his crops using 
human 
waste 
and 
creates 

water by burning hydrazine. 
This combination of voice and 

action makes these scenes 
fascinating, 
comprehensible 

and poignant.

While Watney’s situation 

focuses on survival, the idea 
of doing the extraordinary 
works its way in. At one 
point, 
Watney 
muses 
that 

everywhere 
he 
goes, 
he’s 

the first: to survive, he must 
paradoxically take calculated 
risks 
while 
stepping 
into 

the unknown, forcing these 
combative instincts to work in 
harmony.

As the film diverges from 

its protagonist, this reality 
becomes 
more 
apparent. 

Watney’s crewmates and the 
Earthbound NASA discover 
his survival and try to find a 
way to bring their man home. 
These storylines require a 
large ensemble cast, and Scott 
fills it with big-name talent. 
In lesser hands, these roles 
could be boring exposition 
dumps, but a distinct sense 
of 
humor 
and 
personality 

are brought forth by most 
of the performers. On the 
NASA front, mission director 
Vincent 
Kapoor 
(Chiwetel 

Ejiofor, “12 Years a Slave”) 
and NASA Director Teddy 
Sanders (Jeff Daniels, “The 
Newsroom”) are strong points 
as men who have final say 
and weigh every choice with 
caution. However, there are 
some 
relatively 
thankless 

roles 
like 
Kristen 
Wiig’s 

(“Bridesmaids”) Mindy Park, 
who sometimes operates as 
little more than an audience 
stand-in.

The same goes for Watney’s 

astronaut companions. Jessica 
Chastain (“Zero Dark Thirty”) 
is given the most to work 
with as guilt-ridden mission 
commander Melissa Lewis. 
While Michael Peña (“Ant-
Man”) as pilot Rick Martinez 
develops a strong bond with 
Damon, even when they can 
only communicate through 
typed messages. The rest of 
the crew is good, but don’t have 
as many opportunities. “The 
Martian” never squanders its 
cast, but doesn’t always utilize 
its talent pool to full effect. At 
one point, Watney disappears 
to the background of the film 
in 
favor 
of 
concentrating 

on these storylines. While 
it’s interesting to see the 
challenges of putting together 
a rescue mission, the movie 
loses track of its emotional 
core for too long. A time jump 
makes the transition back 
to 
its 
protagonist 
slightly 

jarring.

However, 
despite 
these 

small struggles in maintaining 
focus, these interlocking sto-
rylines about rescuing Watney 
emphasize the need to extend 
beyond perceived limits as 
nothing comes easy and inno-
vation is the only solution. 
It’s in these accomplishments 
of 
human 
resourcefulness 

that “The Martian” reveals 
why exploring the challeng-
ing reality of space is neces-
sary. In facing the impossible, 
people can achieve more than 
they imagined and humanity, 
as a whole, is driven forward.

Close reading our 

candidates’ memoirs

Politics is increasingly a game 

of short words. Sound bites, slo-
gans and even candidates’ names 
(think of all the posters for Ber-
nie, Hillary and Jeb) have been 
jettisoned to 
the bare mini-
mum.

But with 

the political 
agenda abbre-
viated to 140 
characters, 
the political 
memoir still 
finds a way 
into the hearts 
and hands of the American voter. 
In fact, for the last 60 years, every 
winning presidential candidate 
has published a book before run-
ning. These books often serve as 
a way for the presidential hopeful 
to transition into bonafide can-
didate.

In between the stories of child-

hood and anecdotes about paren-
tal wisdom, there is sometimes 
insight into policy views. We owe 
it to ourselves and each other to 
make an informed decision when 
voting, and that means looking 
at the information provided by 
the candidates. These books are 
a way of allowing a candidate 
to transcend being an annoying 
talking head with views that can 
differ drastically from your own. 
They remind us that underneath 
all the hairspray and suits, there 
are people with childhoods and 
families and dreams. It’s a way 
to find humanity in what can 
seem like a mechanical process. 
While looking through these 
memoirs, I found myself connect-
ing to people with whom I would 
never guess I could find common 
ground.

One of the more surprisingly 

personal memoirs was Marco 
Rubio’s “American Dreams: 
Restoring Economic Opportu-
nity for Everyone.” Rubio begins 
“American Dreams” with a poi-
gnant story of accompanying his 
grandfather to the hospital. As his 
grandfather slipped into a coma, 
a young Rubio promised to make 
something of himself. Quickly 

moving to present day, Rubio 
stresses several times the shared 
blame between Republicans and 
discusses his plans for initiatives 
like increasing access to federal 
student loans. He shares his opin-
ions on subjects like same-sex 
marriage and the laughability of 
liberal arts degrees, subjects on 
which we disagree viscerally. But 
his political memoir may be a lit-
mus test to help people determine 
if Rubio is worth considering.

Judging by the re-release of 

the 1997 “Outsider in the White 
House,” Bernie Sanders doesn’t 
seem to have changed his very lib-
eral views. It’s unusual in a world 
where the word “flip-flop” is used 
so much, you’d think everyone 
in the House of Representa-
tives was wearing inappropriate 
sandals. Sander’s key positions 
— hatred of the one percent, a 
disinterest in campaigning and 
the contempt he holds for both 
major parties involved have been 
the main theme in his life and at 
least establishes consistency and 
genuine beliefs. “Outsider in the 
White House” proves Sanders to 
be unafraid to reveal himself in 
blunt and straightforward way.

In a very different approach, 

Hillary Clinton’s memoir “Hard 
Choices” is a fascinating look 
at her time as President Barack 
Obama’s Secretary of State. She 
shares with the reader the expe-
riences she has had on her dip-
lomatic travels and some of the 
difficulties she had during her 
time in office. The book shows 
how Secretary Clinton faced 
stressful situations with exper-
tise and allows the reader to see 
her intellectual, diplomatic and 
professional authority. What we 
don’t see is a lot of emotional 
exposure. She is reticent to share 
her tales and personal stories, 
which makes sense consider-
ing her vulnerable position as a 
woman running for President. 
As with all political memoirs, we 
only see what the writers wants 
us to.

In contrast, Mike Huckabee’s 

recent memoir “God, Guns, 
Grits and Gravy” leaves little 

to the imagination. (Also, come 
on guys. Who taught Huckabee 
about alliteration? This one is 
on you.) With his startling chap-
ter titles like “Bend over and 
take it like a prisoner!” and his 
concern that Jay-Z is “crossing 
the line from husband to pimp 
by exploiting his wife as a sex 
object,” Huckabee is difficult to 
take seriously.

But receiving first place of 

the category I call “Books I Find 
Difficult to Take Seriously” has 
not even been published. Donald 
Trump’s as-yet-untitled memoir 
is set to be released on October 
27th. “Not since ‘The Art of 
the Deal’ have I had so much 
fun writing a book,” Trump 
announced in the release. 
Considering that 62 percent of 
Republicans feel that Trump 
“tells it like it is and we need that 
right now,” Trump continues 
to surprise, with both his brash 
statements and his high poll 
numbers, despite reports that 
the Republican Party would not 
support a Trump presidency. 
His book will be a chance to see 
if there are any plans for actual 
policy-making in a race where 
attention is paid not to the smart 
or the prepared, but to the bold.

There are roughly five other 

candidates with books out that I 
haven’t even mentioned, or quite 
honestly, cared to read – Jeb Bush, 
Carly Fiorina, Rand Paul, Ben Car-
son and Lindsey Graham. With a 
supply of political memoirs this 
abundant, it would be fantastical 
to imagine that there is a demand 
that meets it. And there isn’t. 
Some of the memoirs are more 
financially successful than others, 
(for example, Lindsey Graham’s 
memoir “My Story” was released 
for free online as a PDF), but the 
incentive for publishers is greater 
than just money. It’s the possibil-
ity of being the publisher of the 
memoir of the next President of 
the United States of America.

FILM REVIEW
‘Mississippi Grind’ is 
carried by characters

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

For The Daily

“Mississippi 
Grind,” 
the 

newest film from directing duo 
Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden 
(“It’s Kind of a 
Funny Story”), 
follows 
two 

pathetic 
gambling 
addicts on an 
odyssey across 
the 
South 

in search of 
enough money 
to 
break 

even. 
Ben 

Mendelsohn 
(“The 
Dark 
Night 
Rises”) 

expertly plays Jerry, a sad real 
estate agent with a knack for 
losing money. He is easily drawn 
in by the fast-talking charms of 
Curtis (Ryan Reynolds, “Green 
Lantern”), a younger version of 
Jerry who appears, at least at 
first, to win wherever Jerry loses, 
in poker and in life. The two 
become a pair soon after Curtis 
slides into Jerry’s poker game, 
asking, “Did you see that rainbow 
yesterday?”

We actually did see that 

rainbow. The film opens with 
a rainbow stretching over a 
pastoral 
scene, 
romantically 

completed with a red tractor 
and silo. This is the first and 
last tribute to the nature of the 
Midwest; scenic shots of the 
plains are quickly replaced with 
rainy streets and flashing lights 
(a different kind of romanticized 
America). 
But 
this 
initial 

rainbow 
remains 
important, 

“a sign,” as the two men tramp 
across the country, betting on 
anything with a name alluding to 
the color spectrum. Even at his 
low point, Jerry seeks out a slot 
machine called “Rainbow Road” 

in a New Orleans casino. They 
carry a “Wizard of Oz” type 
mindset that something better 
is waiting for them somewhere 
over the rainbow. 

As Jerry’s Subaru traverses 

the Southeast, the audience’s 
hope that they will make it to 
“somewhere” dwindles, as does 
the faith that “somewhere” 
exists. According to Curtis, their 
big break lies in New Orleans 
at a poker table with a $25,000 
buy-in. This game is the catalyst 
to their trans-American journey. 
The film doesn’t take long to 
turn into a road trip movie, full 
of Americana spirit emphasized 
by the bluegrass and folk music 
of its soundtrack. As Jerry and 
Curtis roll into Nashville, the 
crooning voice of Big Bill Boonzy 
assures the audience that “this 
train is bound for glory.” And we 
are forced to ask — is it? 

Glory, 
it 
seems, 
is 
less 

important than just playing 
the game. “The journey is a 
destination,” 
Curtis 
claims 

with a wink. Maybe that’s 
why the two men return to the 
table and win big, only to turn 
around and lose it all — a cycle 
that quickly becomes tiresome. 

The repetitive plot might have 
been 
necessary, 
but 
strong 

performances from the two 
leads leave it redundant. Jerry 
could easily have been merely 
pathetic, 
but 
Mendelsohn 

layers him with enough anger 
and sincerity to raise him 
to the level of a compelling 
deadbeat. And Reynolds, who is 
easily written off as a summer 
blockbuster actor, shines as 
Curtis. 
Reynolds’s 
inherent 

charm couples with mystery to 
create a character the audience 
can’t exactly pin down.

“Mississippi 
Grind” 
isn’t 

quite plot driven and it isn’t 
quite character driven. The film 
leans on its dialogue, which 
often fails to offer sufficient 
support. At times the film 
feels like a remake of some 
glamorous ’70s casino movie, 
relying on the audience having 
seen the original to fill in the 
gaps. “Mississippi Grind” longs 
for a time (or a place over the 
rainbow) where two pitiful 
gambling addicts can be heroes, 
a time that no longer exists and 
probably never did. a time that 
no longer exists and probably 
never did.

Why ’Ye should run

By MICHAEL FLYNN

Daily Arts Writer

Kanye West is no stranger 

to making people scratch their 
heads in awe and bewilderment. 
At the most recent VMAs, he 
continued 
this 
time-honored 

tradition of his by announcing 
that he plans to run for President 
in 2020.

Some may be apprehensive 

about the rapper being elected to 
office due to his lack of political 
experience. 
But 
after 
some 

thought, it becomes increasingly 
clear why Kanye is the absolute 
right 
choice 
for 
the 
2020 

Presidency.

1. He’s honest:
Unlike many politicians today, 

Kanye has absolutely no problem 
speaking his mind whenever he 
feels like it. If he can walk onto 
the VMA stage and interrupt 
Taylor Swift, who’s to say he can’t 
demand 
that 
pharmaceutical 

CEOs lower drug prices, or that 
police stop using excessive force? 
Granted, there’s no guarantee he 
will do any of those things, but 
there’s no doubt he’s got the balls 
to do it.

2. He’s young:
As exciting as Bernie Sanders 

is, he’s so old that there’s a huge 
possibility that the stress of the 
Presidency will give him a fatal 
aneurysm the minute he steps 
into office. With Kanye, who’s 
on track to become the youngest 

President since JFK, Americans 
can rest assured that any fatal 
aneurysms he may suffer during 
his tenure as President will not 
be caused by age.

3. 
He 
understands 
the 

economy:

Some have complained about 

the ridiculously steep price of 
Kanye’s new fashion line. But 
there’s a reason for that: He 
knows that it’s worth it. And you 
can be damn sure he knows that 
America’s worth it too. With 
Kanye, no price is too high for 
the freedom of the American 
people.

4. 
He 
knows 
what’s 

important in life:

In a recent interview with 

Vanity Fair, Kanye was quoted 
saying “I don’t go a day without 
shoes.” 
That 
is 
some 
good 

common sense right there. In an 
era of excess and buffoonery from 
politicians, we need a leader with 
a good head on his shoulders.

5. He’ll bring new things to 

the Presidency that are too 
good to pass up:

Imagine the possibilities. A 

presidential debate in which 
he responds to a barb from 
an opposing candidate with a 
pointed “HAH?” An Auto-Tuned 
State of the Union. Free Yeezy 
shoes for everyone (apparently.)

6. Without a presidential bid, 

there’s really no good excuse 
why SWISH isn’t out yet:

Really.

PRESIDENT’ CAMPAIGN

‘No more freshmen’ on Wolverines

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Five games into its season, 

the Michigan football team has 
exceeded the expectations of 
many.

After outscoring their last 

four opponents by a combined 
122-14, the Wolverines have 
climbed to No. 18 in the AP poll, 
have the ninth-highest odds to 
win the national championship, 
according to Bovada, and boast 
the nation’s No. 2 overall defense.

Despite 
the 
apparent 

improvement since last season, 
the success can almost entirely 
be attributed to players who 
played last year.

Of Michigan’s 14 true freshmen 

on scholarship, just defensive 
back Tyree Kinnel and wide 
receivers Brian Cole and Grant 
Perry have seen game action, and 
even they have only seen the field 
sparingly.

But with upcoming matchups 

against No. 13 Northwestern and 
No. 3 Michigan State, Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh has reached 
the point in the season where he’s 
no longer afraid to deploy all of 
the troops.

“Now’s the time,” he said. “We 

truly believe there are no more 
freshmen. When they go through 
a month of training camp and 
four games, when you’ve played 
four games, a third of a season, 
nobody is a freshman anymore. 
… If they’re gonna show that they 
can contribute as a freshman, 
now’s the time to do it.”

At his weekly press conference 

Monday, Harbaugh said that 
running back Karan Higdon, 
cornerback Keith Washington 
and defensive ends Reuben Jones 
and Shelton Johnson are also 
close to seeing game action.

Not 
coincidentally, 
junior 

cornerback Channing Stribling 
and junior running back De’Veon 
Smith missed Saturday’s game 
with 
injuries, 
while 
senior 

defensive end Mario Ojemudia 
tore his Achilles and is out for the 
entire season.

The injury bug is one path for 

freshmen to see the field, but with 
a suddenly legitimate chance at 
contending for a conference title, 
the quickest way to see game 
action is simply being the best 
player on the field — the same 
standard for everyone else.

“Personally, I’ve never been 

one to come in and not play 
football for a year, and I don’t 
think any of them feel that way 
either,” said senior linebacker 
and team captain Joe Bolden. “If 
you want to come in, you want to 
play, do something about it. Get 
yourself on the field.

“Freshmen aren’t freshmen 

anymore. You’ve been here long 
enough, you know the way to 
carry yourselves and how to 

practice and how to help the 
team get better, and that’s what 
we expect of them every day.”

Though he only played on 

special teams against Maryland, 
Kinnel served as an example of 
Bolden’s message — the freshman 
earned playing time simply by 
competing in practice. Whether 
it was informal team races or 
just effort in drills, Kinnel made 
the coaching staff an offer they 
couldn’t refuse, and they didn’t 
want to.

“He just seemed like a guy who 

was screaming to ‘Get me on the 
field, Coach,’ ” Harbaugh said. 
“Not in the vocal way or coming 
into the office like, ‘Hey, I need 
more playing time,’ but in the 
best way: with what he did on the 
field and how he was competing 
in practice and in competitions. 
So I listened.”

The 
drawback 
to 
that 

approach, of course, is that 
playing true freshmen requires 
them to burn their redshirts and 
extra year of eligibility.

Former Michigan coach Brady 

Hoke drew criticism for playing 
too many true freshmen when 
they weren’t ready and losing the 
extra eligibility. Harbaugh isn’t 
Hoke, but his time coaching at 
both the college and professional 
levels taught him that worrying 
about burning a redshirt can 
burn a team.

“It’s always been my feeling 

that those who can play as true 
freshmen ultimately become the 
best players,” Harbaugh said. 
“You get better at football by 
playing football, and the ones that 
are mentally and physically ready 
to do that as true (freshmen) have 
a chance to do that.”

Tyree Kinnel earned playing time against Maryland because of how he has performed in practice and in drills.

St. Louis Blues give Yost 
rave reviews during visit

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

Yost Field House has been a 

home for Michigan athletics since 
1923, but officially became the 
stomping ground of the Michigan 
hockey team in 1973 when it was 
converted into Yost Ice Arena.

Since then, the facility has 

undergone five renovations, each 
improving the quality of the 
establishment for players, fans 
and students.

Yost underwent its most recent 

renovations in 2006, 2011 and 
2012. The locker rooms were 
enhanced and a high-definition 
jumbotron was installed in 2006 
and 2011, respectively, while 
the 2012 renovation added more 
seating options, including a new 
press box. 

And when the Wolverines 

hosted the St. Louis Blues of the 
National Hockey League over 
the weekend for their preseason 
team-building trip, it was a 
unique 
opportunity 
for 
two 

members of the organization 
— coach Ken Hitchcock and 
defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk 
— to reflect on how the facilities 
have progressed.

Shattenkirk played in the U.S. 

National 
Team 
Development 

Program from 2005 to 2007, and 

during that time he billeted with 
the family of current Wolverine 
sophomore forward Niko Porikos 
in Ann Arbor.

Shattenkirk has had a front-

row seat to view the evolution of 
Michigan’s hockey facilities, and 
from his perspective, Yost has 
come a long way since his time 
with Porikos’ family.

“Yost looks great now with the 

new renovations,” Shattenkirk 
said. “It looks like a completely 
different rink. It just seems like 
every time I come back, there’s 
more buildings on campus and 
everything gets bigger and better.”

Hitchcock, on the other hand, 

spent two and a half seasons 
at the helm of the Dallas Stars’ 
International 
Hockey 
League 

franchise, the Kalamazoo Wings, 
from 1993 to 1996 before being 
awarded the head-coaching job 
for their NHL counterpart.

During 
his 
tenure 
in 

Kalamazoo, Hitchcock had a 
seat in Yost’s press box reserved 
for him. He attended almost 
every Friday night game he 
could. When he was promoted 
to Dallas’ NHL head coaching 
position, he still brought the 
Stars for summer trips to Ann 
Arbor for five years.

So when the Blues used Ann 

Arbor as their temporary home, 

squeezing in a few practices 
between Shattenkirk’s planned 
team trips to the Brown Jug 
and Zingerman’s Delicatessen, 
Hitchcock was impressed with 
how far the arena has come 
over the years and cited it as an 
incentive for recruits to choose to 
wear the maize and blue sweater.

“The second (set of renovations) 

brings you up to speed with the 
big boys. A big part of (recruiting) 
is you’ve got to have facilities, 
and I’ve always said that this 
is 
a 
player-friendly 
facility,” 

Hitchcock said. “It’s not just the 
coach that is part of that program, 
it’s everybody else too. So you’ve 
got to have the facilities to show 
off with the players (so they) feel 
comfortable.

“This is a facility where you 

don’t have to walk very far to 
get much. The players have got 
everything here. They’ve got 
really good people who have been 
around a long time — strength 
people, medical people, they’ve 
got a lot of good things going.”

With the consensus between 

Hitchcock 
and 
Shattenkirk 

that Yost is on par with — if not 
superior to — the majority of 
hockey arenas, one thing has 
become clear: If Michigan loses 
out on a recruit, don’t point the 
finger at the 92-year-old facility.

The St. Louis Blues enjoyed the facilities at Yost Ice Arena during their team-building trip over the weekend.

Larkin makes Red Wings

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

The 
Michigan 
hockey 

coaching staff experienced a 
flood of emotions Monday upon 
hearing that former Wolverines 
standout Dylan Larkin had made 
the Detroit Red Wings’ opening-
night roster.

Not only were the coaches 

ecstatic that Larkin had cracked 
the lineup, but they also felt a 
sense of relief. For them, it would 
have been gut-wrenching to see 
Larkin in the American Hockey 
League rather than suiting up in 
the maize and blue. And just a few 
weeks ago, Michigan coach Red 
Berenson didn’t seem optimistic 
that Larkin could make the NHL 
club.

“He’s proven he can play 

there, 
so 
good 
for 
him,” 

Berenson said on Monday. “I 
think their intent was to put 
him in the American League, 
and then when he was ready to 
stay in the NHL, he would be up 
there. It says something about 
college hockey. It says that they 
aren’t far away.”

After 
all, 
before 
Monday, 

no teenager had made the Red 
Wings’ 
opening-night 
roster 

since 
Jiri 
Fischer 
in 
1999-

2000. Just 12 teenagers have 
accomplished the same feat for 
Detroit since Steve Yzerman 
made the Red Wings as an 
18-year-old in 1983. But Larkin, 
who boasts exceptional maturity, 
speed, hockey IQ and talent, 
defied the odds.

The 19-year-old starred for the 

Wolverines last season, notching 
47 points en route to being 
named the Big Ten Freshman of 
the Year.

The Red Wings have gained a 

reputation for being notoriously 
careful with their top prospects. 
But after Larkin scored three 
goals and tallied an assist while 
playing top-line minutes in the 
preseason, new head coach Jeff 
Blashill had no choice but to keep 
Larkin at the highest level. 

“We just felt, I specifically 

really felt, he makes us better,” 
Blashill told reporters Monday. 
“And to an exponential amount 
that we felt it was important he 

started on the team. We just felt 
he has earned the spot.

“As I have said before, if a young 

guy makes our team better and 
is going to play enough minutes 
to make our team better, then 
he was going to be on the team. 
Whether 
it 

was him or 
someone 
else.”

Blashill 

went on to say 
that 
Larkin 

would 
begin 

his Red Wings 
tenure playing 
with 
former 

Michigan 
State 
star 
Justin 
Abdelkader 
and 

likely 
Hall-of-Famer 
Henrik 

Zetterberg.

“We feel like he has earned a 

chance to play in the top nine, 
which is going to be the type of 
role which is going to give him 
the minutes to be successful,” 
Blashill said. “As a result of that, 

we made the 
decision 
to 

put him on the 
team.”

So 
while 

the Red Wings 
coaching staff 
is eager to see 
how 
Larkin 

performs 
in 
his 
first 

game, his old 
coaching staff 

back in Ann Arbor was nothing 
but joyous.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Dylan Larkin was named to the Detroit Red Wings’ roster Monday.

“He’s proven he 
can play there, 

so good for 

him.”

Glasgow learns 
from past errors

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

In March, Graham Glasgow 

was in the middle of his final 
spring camp as a Michigan 
offensive 
lineman. 
He 
had 

started the Wolverines’ last 
11 games in 2014, after being 
suspended for the first following 
an arrest for driving while 
intoxicated that summer.

But 
Glasgow 
served 
his 

suspension and hadn’t violated 
his probation, which was set for 
one year.

Then things changed again. 

Jim Harbaugh replaced former 
coach Brady Hoke, who had 
given Glasgow a second chance 
last fall. And Glasgow violated 
his 
probation 
by 
failing 
a 

breathalyzer test, earning him his 
second suspension.

Glasgow was a fifth-year senior 

with a brother (Ryan, a redshirt 
junior defensive tackle) already 
on the team and another (Jordan, 
a freshman safety) on the way. He 
was in position for a starting spot 
this season. And all of it appeared 
to be in jeopardy.

It was Harbaugh’s decision. 

According to Glasgow, the two 
sat down three or four times the 
week after Glasgow violated his 
probation.

“We kind of came together,” 

Glasgow said. “He didn’t really 
tell me that I had to really do 
anything. It was more along the 
lines of, ‘How do you think we 
should do this together?’ ”

Harbaugh chose to reinstate 

Glasgow, and now, almost seven 
months 
later, 
Glasgow 
has 

become the team’s most consistent 
offensive lineman at center.

And that hasn’t been his only 

improvement.

“Over the past four years of 

playing football, over the past 
few years of off-the-field stuff, 
I would say I’ve just grown a lot 
as a person,” Glasgow said. “I’ve 
grown a lot as a man, and I’ve 
really just matured. I just try to 
do everything the right way.

“I can’t afford to do anything 

the wrong way. I just need to make 
sure I’m doing the right things at 
all times. It’s just not having an 
option. It’s either I do what I need 
to do, or I’d be out of here.”

With his back up against the 

wall, Glasgow has worked things 
out and made his way back into his 
spot on the offensive line, proving 
himself to a new coaching staff.

Harbaugh 
doesn’t 
accept 

any excuses — and in this case, 
the off-the-field issues were no 
exception. 
He 
kept 
Glasgow 

accountable for his actions.

“He’s tough on me, but he 

understands,” 
Glasgow 
said. 

“He’s dealt with me in a way that 
I feel like a dad would deal with 
this issue. It’s really helped me 
out a lot.”

Now, Glasgow has bigger goals 

in mind. He plays on a much-
improved offensive line that has 
been a key to Michigan’s success 
this year. And after all, he’s the 
eldest of three Glasgows on the 
team — and by extension, he’s 
expected to be a leader.

“When I first came here, I 

didn’t think Ryan would come 
here to begin with,” Glasgow 
said. “It was really just my goal 
to earn a scholarship and play. 
When I was 19, I didn’t think that 
they would be like this. You just 
put in the work every day, and it 
sort of just happens. You gotta 
have the goals to make it happen, 
but it’s just a stepping stone. You 
want to earn a scholarship and be 
a starter, and then what’s the next 
goal? And the next goal?”

‘Mo Weezy’ adjusting to life in America, Michigan

The freshman is 
impressing, but 
still has room to 

improve

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Moritz Wagner hadn’t seen a 

rebounding gun before.

A common sight in American 

gyms, Michigan men’s basketball 
players 
frequently 
use 
the 

device, which funnels made and 
missed shots into a machine that 
shoots the ball back into its user’s 
waiting hands. It’s addictively 
convenient — instead of wasting 
time chasing basketballs around 
the court, players use their 

limited time and energy working 
on their jump shot.

So Wagner recently asked, 

a day after using it for the first 
time, if he could give the gun 
another shot. But the fresh-
faced, 18-year-old German made 
an 
understandable 
mistake: 

instead of requesting to use the 
gun, he asked if he could go back 
on the “pistol.”

“Nobody knew what he was 

talking about,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein.

Minor linguistic nuances are 

the tip of the iceberg when it 
comes to the transition Wagner 
faces. 
Shifting 
continents 
is 

plenty to handle on its own, but 
Wagner is also in the midst of 
simply transitioning to college. 
Within the program, he doesn’t 
have much company.

Unlike senior guards Spike 

Albrecht and Caris LeVert, who 
started at Michigan as part of a 
five-member 
recruiting 
class, Wagner 
counts 
only 

freshman 
forward Brent 
Hibbits, 
a 

walk-on, 
among 
his 

classmates.

“(Wagner) is 

still getting the 
slang 
down,” 

said sophomore forward Aubrey 
Dawkins. “They’re both really 
smart kids, and doing well so far, 
I think.”

But Wagner’s time playing 

in 
Germany’s 
Basketball 

Bundesliga, the country’s highest 

level of club competition, should 
prove invaluable.

“Fortunately, I think Wagner, 

since 
he’s 

been 
playing 

overseas, 
has 

been 
around 

older 
guys,” 

Albrecht 
said. 
“He’s 

played 
with 

some 
grown 

men. 
He’s 
a 

very 
high-IQ 

basketball 
player, 
so 

he fits right in here. He’s been 
picking up on things very quickly, 
and he brings an edge, a sense of 
competitiveness to the team that 
not a lot of freshmen do.”

Wagner — or “Mo Weezy,” as 

Albrecht calls him — averaged 

16.8 points and 5.3 rebounds per 
game for Alba Berlin, one of the 
German league’s most successful 
clubs, in 2014-15.

After committing to Michigan 

in April, the freshman forward 
arrived in Ann Arbor in June 
and took classes during the 
University’s summer term.

Wagner had adjusted well, 

Beilein said Friday, and has 
begun adding weight to his 
youthful frame. At 6-foot-10, he 
displayed impressive touch from 
the outside at the Wolverines’ 
open practice on Friday.

Where Wagner might slot into 

the lineup is still in question. 
While he’s listed at one inch 
taller than sophomore forward 
Ricky Doyle, who established a 
firm hold on the ‘5’ position last 
season, Wagner slots in at just 

225 pounds, and likely lacks the 
physicality to command the low 
post.

Junior forward Zak Irvin is 

capable of filling time at power 
forward if needed, and with 
sophomore forwards D.J. Wilson 
and Kameron Chatman back 
from freshman seasons that 
showed flashes of promise, there 
likely won’t be many minutes 
available at the ‘4,’ either.

Wherever he slots in — if 

he slots in — Wagner’s talent 
is unmistakable, but Beilein 
acknowledged that he is very 
much a work in progress, albeit 
an exciting one.

“One minute, he’ll look very 

awkward,” Beilein said. “And 
the next minute he’ll give you a 
‘wow’ moment. He’s 6-foot-10, 
and he just did that?”

“He’s a very 

high-IQ 
basketball 

player.”
