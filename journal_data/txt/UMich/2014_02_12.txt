Peace Cgnizes'U

New initiative aims
to combine many
services under one
message
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
After launching its new pro-
gram in the fall, Wolverine
Wellness, the University Health
Service is striving to streamline
its offerings to better serve stu-
dents.
Previously known as the
Health Promotion and Commu-
nity Relations at UHS, Wolverine
Wellness is still under develop-
ment, but is beginning to form
a vision for the future of health
offerings at the University.
A draft of the first common
agenda was decided upon over
the summer. In October, Wolver-
ine Wellness discussed the agen-
da with students in student focus
groups and edited the draft.
The current draft states that
"through collective and innova-
tive programs, services and facil-
ities, students will grow in their
capacity to integrate health and

wellness as part of success, build
resilience to manage the fluc-
tuations of life, make thoughtful
choices that reduce harm and
find meaning and purpose."
Wolverine Wellness Director
Mary Jo Desprez said adminis-
trators in 2010 were originally
focused on integrating many
departments to better serve stu-
dent health and wellness.
Currently, different UHS
units focus on different parts
of the student body - Counsel-
ing and Psychological Services
looks at mental health issues
while Recreational Sports looks
at physical fitness issues - and
Wolverine Wellness hopes to
combine efforts for each student
in the future.
"We are looking at how we can
do better by making sure our ser-
vices look at a student as a whole
person," Desprez said.
Along with infrastructure
redesign, UHS could also benefit
from physical renovations, said
Dr. Robert A. Winfield, the Uni-
versity's chief health officer, said.
Though there is no formal pro-
posal to create a new UHS facil-
ity, Winfield has begun to think
that when the time comes, pos-

For 14th year,
program ranks the
University as a top
contributor
By WILL GREENBERG
Daly News Editor
For the 14th year in a row, the
University is on the Peace Corps'
top contributor list, ranking fifth
nationally. N
In 2013, 81 graduates worked

with the Peace Corps, the third-
most out of the large colleges and
universities within the Big Ten,
behind the number one-ranked
University of Wisconsin and
number four-ranked Ohio State
University. This year's group
brings the University to a total
of 2,556 alumni recruits, the
fourth-most of any school since
the Corps first started in 1961.
The University's connection to
the Peace Corps has been strong
since the program's inception,
which began with a speech given
by President John F. Kennedy on

the steps of the Michigan Union
in 1960.
In a statement, Carrie Hes-
sler-Radelet, Peace Corps acting
director, said the organization
has consistently drawn a great
deal of passionate members,
especially from the University.
"The enthusiasm for service
that President Kennedy saw
on the Michigan campus more
than 50 years ago continues
to drive students to the Peace
Corps," Hessler-Radelet said.
"The University of Michigan's
commitment to service and

cross-cultural learning makes it
consistently one of the top five
recruiters of Peace Corps volun-
teers."
Brian Smyser, a graduate stu-
dent in the School of Natural
Resources and Environment and
campus recruiter for the Peace
Corps, said the University's con-
sistently high contribution is
reflective of a strong passion for
volunteerism at the school and
within Ann Arbor.
"University of Michigan
programs are well respected,"

Ohio State promotes wellness

Student wellness programs at
Ohio State University have been
reformed to align with the find-
ings of a new study conducted
by Brown University and the
Miriam Hospital, The Ohio State
Lantern reported Monday.
The study suggests that col-
leges should intervene early, even
during a student's freshman year,
to assess alcohol abuse risk and
provide one-on-one feedback.
In addition to individualized
assessments and counseling,
the study also showed the effec-
tiveness of teaching moderation
strategies. A Brown press release
said colleges "screen all freshmen
within their first few weeks for
alcohol risk and offer effective
combinations of interventions for

those who report drinking."
The Brief Alcohol Screen-
ing and Intervention for College
Students program has shown its
commitment to making more of
an impact on campus. Amanda
Blake, program coordinator for
Alcohol, Tobacco & Other Drug
Education and Prevention at
OSU's Student Wellness Center,
described the program that has
been set in place as a potential
model for other universities.

Asteroid mining could be

Petition started to revive

beneficial for space travel part-time legislature

Materials from
space potentially
beneficial to Earth
resource supplies
ByTOMMCBRIEN
Daily StaffReporter
Earth is more than just our
home planet - it's is a giant
spaceship with a finite amount
of materials. Strain on Earth
is resources grows in propor-
tion to the human population,
and the planet is already run-
ning out of important materials
such as the rare earth metals
that make our electronics work.
However, some University
researchers are embarking on
an effort to lessen the stress on
the mother ship: the endeavor

of asteroid mining.
Asteroid mining refers to
a future practice in which
humans could prospect, cor-
ral and mine asteroids - flying
chunks of rock in space - for
useful materials such as water,
iron, platinum and rare earth
metals. The materials could be
used for many different eco-
nomic and welfare purposes.
NASA's 2014 budget proposal
contains the Asteroid Initiative,
which provides a model of what
asteroid mining would look like.
The first step of the initiative
would be prospecting, or exam-
ining an asteroid to determine
what elements it contains. The
second step would be redirec-
tion, or capturingthe asteroid to
bring it under control and mov-
ing it to a safe place for mining,
such as the Moon's orbit. The
third and final step would be

EU .' K

the mining itself, either manned
or unmanned.
One purpose of asteroid min-
ing would be to utilize materials
in space exploration. Engineer-
ing Prof. Alec Gallimore said
asteroid miningwouldbe avalu-
able contribution to expanded
space programs.
"The question is,'What is the
most efficient way of colonizing
the solar system?"' he said. "And
the notion of doing that might
be so-called 'living off the land.'
Instead of bringing resources
that we need to colonize Mars,
asteroids, etc. all the way from
the Earth, what if we were able
to actually extract those essen-
tial materials that are needed
locally?"
With a current cost of about
$10,000 per pound to send
something into orbit, the pos-
sibility of using materials found
in space,.as opposed to
bringing all supplies
from Earth, would
be the most cost- and
energy-effective option
available.
This would fit into
what Engineering Prof.
Brian Gilchrist said is a
"resurgence and entre-
preneurial mindset of
new things we can do
in space that haven't
been considered at all."
Gilchrist's research
focuses on space teth-
ering, which involves
connecting two space-
craft with a conductive
cable. As the spacecraft
orbit in Earth's elec-
tromagnetic field, the
cable becomes charged.
Solar power is used to
add or leak charge from
this circuit, causing the
two spacecraft to move
up or down. This theo-
retical system would
allow the satellites to
gain momentum with-
out a propellant, and
could have practical
applications for tug-

Michigan group to
gather signatures for
small government
ballot proposal
ByANASTASSIOS
ADAMOPOULOS
Daily StaffReporter
This weekend, organizers will
begin the hunt for more than
320,000 signatures necessary
to put their proposal for a part-
time legislature on a statewide
ballot.
The Committee to Restore
Michigan's Part-Time Legisla-
ture launched a petition to bring
the question of a part-time leg-
islature before voters on the
Nov. 4 election ballot. The peti-
tion was approved Feb. 6 by the
Board of State Canvassers.
This petition is the first
attempt by this eight-member
committee to bring the proposal
before voters.
If the petition is approved,
it would not be the first time
the state has operated under a
part-time legislature. Though
Michigan has had a full-time
legislature since 1963, it is only
one of four states - along with
California, New York and Penn-
sylvania - that still have a full-
time legislature.
By enacting a part-time legis-
lature, lawmakers would be paid
less and would work on a part-
time basis. Additionally, the leg-
islature would only meet during
a limited number of days.
Committee Chairman Norm
Kammeraad said a part-time
legislature would help lawmak-
ers prioritize their work in Lan-
sing.
"(The proposal) will make
government more efficient by
taking the legislature that we
have ... and placing it in a part-
time role," he said.
The petition would establish
60 days as the maximum annual
number of legislative sessions,
and would reduce legislators'

salaries from roughly $75,000
to $35,000 annually. The plan
would also reduce the total
number of legislative staff mem-
bers to 250.
Kammeraad also wants to see
full disclosure of payments of
legislators' expenses.
He added that one of the
main issues behind the propos-
al is that the cost of producing,
adopting and enforcing each leg-
islative bill is too high. By short-
ening the time legislators spend
in their roles, they will be forced
to prioritize the bills they work
on.
"They are not going to have
the time to sit there and try to
make a name for themselves," he
said.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said he views the effort
as an unproductive reaction of
dismay toward the government.
"Part time legislature is going
to guarantee that we have less
capable, less qualified and less
well-informed legislators," he
said.
The pay cuts will also nega-
tively affect legislators, Irwin
said. People will be less effective
as legislators because they will
be more focused on doing other
jobs to generate income.
"It will also mean that the
types of people who can run
for office are going to be either
retired folks or extremely
wealthy folks because (those)
who have to work for a living
and have to pay for their mort-
gage - those people aren't going
to be able to be public servants,"
he said.
Another component of the
proposal will require the disclo-
sure of all bills five days before
a vote of the legislature. This
change will allow the public
time to examine the content of
the bill, Kammeraad said. Under
the current system, legislators
do not know the content of all
the bills they pass.
"What we've got right now is
it comes out of the committee
and it goes for vote, instantly,"
Kammerad said. "And there's

no disclosure, nobody is given
the chance to absorb it. Not even
the legislators themselves know
what they are voting on half the
time."
Though Irwin said he rec-
ognizes the volume of bills can
pose a challenge, he said a part-
time legislature would only
increase the extent of the prob-
lem.
"There will still be a flood of
complicated issues; legislators
will just have far less time and it
will be far more likely that leg-
islators will be voting on issues
that they don't really under-
stand," he said.
LSA sophomore Derek Magill,
president of the University's
chapter of Young Americans for
Liberty, said he fully supports
the idea of a part-time legisla-
ture, as well as the reduction in
pay.
He added that though some
members of his organization
have been working closely with
those involved in the part-time
legislature committee, there has
been no formal alliance between
the two groups.
"My organization hasn't
thought about doing that yet, but
that may be something coming
down the pipeline depending on
whether it gets enough atten-
tion on campus," Magill said.
"It's something my organization
definitely supports."
As the committee begins to
gather signatures, Kammeraad
said the petition drive will be
conducted on a grassroots basis.
"Right now we have already
allocated captains in just about
every county in the state who
will be leading the petition drive
in their counties," he said.
The committee needs to gath-
er the signatures before July 7
for the proposal to appear on the
Nov. 4 ballot.
The committee will end the
petition drive on July 1 so it can
prepare to submit the results to
the Michigan Secretary of State.
Kammeraad also said the group
has set a 400,000-signature tar-
get to ensure its goal is met.

PEACE CORPS
From Page 1A
Smyser said. "The Peace Corps
sees University of Michigan
undergrads as well prepared for
Peace Corps service, and so I
think that's a positive thing that
makes Peace Corps take atten-
tion of undergrads here."
Smyser served in the Corps
from 2010 to 2012 in Malawi. He
said the University's branch is
particularly tight-knit, with for-
mer volunteers often returning
to the program as staff members
or continuing to help.
"Returning Peace Corps vol-
unteers are attracted to Michi-
gan as a graduate program, and
that kind of maintains conti-
nuity between undergraduate
and graduate programs, kind
of establishing a larger ethic
of Peace Corps service, public
service, volunteerism, stuff like
that," he said.
In terms of the composition of
volunteers from the University,
Smyser said the group is highly
qualified, many with high lan-
guage skills and experience
in environmental studies and

health. He said the Corps draws
most students from LSA and
the College of Engineering, but
also has members from the Ross
School of Business and the Ford
School of Public Policy. Volun-
teers work on a variety of proj-
ects ranging from manual labor
and infrastructure to education.
Nate Gire is another former
Peace Corps volunteer and Uni-
versity alum, and worked in
Peru promoting public health
from 2010 to 2012. He also said
the University has a strong
ethic of volunteerism, adding
that Peace Corps members form
bonds together through their
shared experiences abroad -
even between students working
in different parts of the globe.
"There's a reason they call
it the toughest job you'll ever
love," Gire said. "It's inspired me
to go more into public service
and to come to U of M for grad
school. I think that both U of
M and Peace Corps go hand-in-
hand." I

Tuesday, Hessler-Radelet said
graduating college students are
still able to apply for a 2015 pro-
gram; the deadline is March 1.


SEXPERTISE
From Page 1A
ual choices. Based on research
conducted in the Detroit suburb
of Grosse Pointe, Neale found
many young people are being
forced or pressured into engag-
ing in sexual activity.
"Lots of young girls are hav-
ing sex that they are not choos-
ing to have," she said.
Neale also provided three
main pointers for a happy,
healthy sex life, including
"knowing your body," "granting
yourself permission for plea-
sure, and understanding that
pleasure is both your right and
your responsibility",and "decid-
ing for yourself what's right and
what's wrong," in terms of your
sexual behavior.
She concluded her address
by encouraging the audience
to stop judging others on their
sexual choices, and to instead
become empowered to make
their own.
Elizabeth Armstrong, asso-
ciate professor of sociology &
organizational studies, dis-
cussed her research, which she
saidwasinspiredbyherstudents
in her section of a sexual diver-
sity class she taught at Indiana
University. In her inquiry, she
surveyed more than 20,000 col-
lege students across the United
States about their experiences
with hooking up and sexual rela-
tionships on campus.
Armstrong found that, on
average, students reported
abouteighthookups, seven dates
and two relationships by their
senior year of college.
"The notion that relation-
ships are dead, dating is dead
on college campuses, is just not
true," she said.
Additionally, Armstrong
found that not many students
are engaging solely in random

hookups. In her survey, 46 per-
cent of students reported they
knew the other person moder-
ately to very well in their last
hookup. She also found that
both women and men reported
a better sexual experience after
repeated sex with one person,
and that men and women actu-
ally have a similar desire for
lasting relationships.
Both speakers. emphasized
the importance of students tak-
ing charge of their sexuality.
In an interview after the
event, Neale said it is crucial for
students to put what they know
about sexual activity into prac-
tice.
"I don't think the question
is whether or not students are
informed. It's whether or not
they use that information,"
Neale said. "There aren't many
students who aren't aware of
the concept of safer sex, not all
students know that safer sex
supplies are available for free at
UHS and not all students recog-
nize that they are personally at
risk for negative consequences."
Armstrong said events such
as Sexpertise are an important
part of that learning process.
"I think what most of what
people learn in college they
learn from each other. I think
one of the ways that people can
become better educated about
sexuality is talking," she said.
"To their friends, to their lovers,
to their partners ... and finding
out what sex means to them."
Over the next three days,
Sexpertise will continue with a
series of events, including pre-
sentations titled "Finding Plea-
sure," "Kink for Beginners" and
"Mobile Love."
As part of the event, anony-
mous HIV testing will be held
throughout the week at UHS
and on Wednesday and Thurs-
day at the Safe Sex Store on

"If given the option many years
forward I would like to see a larg-
er facility that could co-locate the

SAPAC and other health related
services" Winfield wrote in an
e-mail interview.
Agreeing on the common agen-
da is an essential first step before
any plans can be made for a new

Rackham student Samuel Mol-
nar, a CSG representative who
co-authored the resolution, said
BSU's withdrawal of support was
a detriment to the bill but not a
coincidence.
"The point of this is to get all
these (student) groups to be allies
and I think that we're going to
be a lot stronger if we can stick
together," Molnar said. "The
schism between these groups is
not new and it's not by accident,
it's meant to keep us from build-
ing a real, strong movement."

ward.
Students know the facts and
know what is good for their per-
sonal well-being, Desprez said,
but that does not necessarily
correlate with a typical college
social life. The hope is that Wol-
verine Wellness shows up more
in a student's everyday life as a
reminder to make responsible
decisions.
Wolverine Wellness recently
piloted a new wellness coach-
ing program where students can
make an appointment with awell-
ness coach to talk and set goals for
themselves.
Mobile applications including
the Stress Buster and Stay In The
Blue apps are other ways Wolver-
ine Wellness is trying to stay at
the forefront in students' lives.
Another goal Desprez has for
the Wolverine Wellness program
on improving student life - spe-
cifically residential life and inter-
disciplinary studies - as well as
innovation and creativity as top
considerations for the award. The
announcement also noted Cole-
man's expansion of academic
partnerships, both with univer-
sities around the world and with
Google, which will "enable the
public to search the text of the
University's 7-million-volume
library."
During her tenure at the Uni-
versity, Coleman spearheaded
The Michigan Difference cam-
paign, which raised $3.2 billion
for a variety of programs and
to minority groups in need of
more representation on the Uni-
versity campus.
CSG President Michael Proppe
moved to change a line that origi-
nally stated, "... and be it further
resolved that CSG defends the
right of minority and anti-racist
students to speak the plain truth
about racism ..." to "CSG defends
the right freedom of speech for all
students."
Molnar said this wasn't a
worthwhile rewrite.
"This isn't a resolution about
free speech, it's a resolution about
racism," Molnar said. "Should we
defend to the free speech of stu-
dents to be racist?"
Eventually, this language
changed to say "CSG defends the
right of all students to speak the
plain truth about racism," avoid-
ing the problem of free speech but
including the entire student body
rather than restricting the resolu-
tion to minorities.

is to cross-train coaches to know
the connections between sexual
health, eating and body image and
alcohol- and drug-related issues,
so they can properly educate and
help students.
Winfield said alcohol use on
campus is clearly related to issues
of serious harm, including sexual
assault, violence and academic
failure, and hopes that the Wol-
verine Wellness program can
work to address these issues and
their causes.
Wolverine Wellness will also
work to eradicate the stigma sur-
rounding mental and behavior
issues that students have, a con-
cern voiced by students as well as
administrators, Desprez said.
"I hope that students will be
more accepting of imperfection,
void of the stigma associated with
mental and emotional health, and
initiatives. Additionally, Cole-
man created the Residential Life
Initiative to renovate residential
halls across campus.
The organization also noted
Coleman's selection as one of
six university presidents to help
launch the Advanced Manufac-
turing Partnership an effort that
fosters collaboration between
industry, universities and the fed-
eral government.
Coleman will receive the award
on March 9 at ACE's 96th Annual
Meeting in San Diego. She will
also deliver the annual Robert H.
Atwell Lecture, which focuses on
a timely higher education topic.
Manes, an LSA representative in
the Assembly and the 2014 forUM
presidential candidate, suggested
an amendment stating "the CSG
assembly requests that the presi-
dent of CSG shall express his sup-
port for this resolution at the next
regent meeting." This amend-
ment was passed as well.
Prior to discussing the resolu-
tion, speakers from The Coalition
to Defend Affirmative Action,
Integration, and Immigrant
Rights and Fight for Equality By
Any Means Necessary, or BAMN,
asked CSG to declare direct sup-
port for 10-percent minority
enrollment, a policy that BAMN
claimed the University promised
to achieve over 40 years ago,
BAMN members in attendance
included a University alum, cur-
rent University students and sev-
eral high school students mostly
from the Detroit area.

This past weekend, Desprez
and 29 University students and
staff traveled to Purdue Univer-
sity and the University of Illinois
to examine how other universities
approach wellness in rec sports
programs.
University staff from Student
Life, Recreational Sports, Uni-
versity Unions, Auxiliary Capi-
tal Projects and Architecture,

observed newly renovated spaces,
including leisure pools, multi-

rooms and had the opportunity to
speak to students and staff at the
respective campuses.
Last March, more than 1,500
leaders in higher education con-"

been awarded several honorary

which he labeled as aggressive
and not worthy of merit. Maya,
added that affirmative action
should have a resolution to itself,
separate from the BSU's more
attainable goals.
Public Policy junior Bobby
Dishell, CSG vice president;
reminded the assembly that while
a well-formed proposal support-
ing diversity was important, rep-
resentatives needed to keep the
feasibility of new initiatives in
perspective as a student-based
organization.
"It's very effective to work with
the administration with active
action plans that we at CSG can
do, and not necessarily take posi-
tions on national policy issues
that aren't going to be decided
here in this room," Dishell said.
Now, the resolution will head
to the Senate Advisory Commit-
tee on University Affairs and
eventually to E. Royster Harper,
vice president for student affairs.

recent limitations to
women's testimony
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- A new draft law in Afghani-
stan that would limit testimony
in domestic violence cases is
drawing international outcry,
with activists warning it is part
of a broader trend toward roll-
ing back women's rights in the
nation.
Afghanistan's parliament
last month approved changes
to the country's criminal code
that would prevent relatives. of

alleged abusers from testify-
ing against them. Legal experts
say this would have a chilling
effect on prosecutions involving
violence against women, where
relatives are often the only wit-
nesses.
As the law awaits final signa-
ture from President Hamid Kar-
zai, a growing chorus of Afghan
activists and of Kabul's Western
allies alike are urging him to
veto the legislation.
The issue is buried in about
100 pages of Afghanistan's new
criminal code - labeled Article
26. While it does not specifically
mention women or domestic
violence, Article 26 bars a broad
swath of "relatives" for acting as
witnesses - an issue in a coun-

try where the bulk of violence
against women is committed by
or in front of family members,
especially given how restricted
freedom of movement is for
many women.
In practice, legal experts say,
it would mean that a woman
cannot testify that her uncle
raped her, that a mother who
sees her daughter beaten by her
father or brother, cannot testify;
that family members witness-
ing a young woman being forced
into marriage by her father can-
not be used in a prosecution,
that a sister or brother who wit-
nesses an honor killing cannot
be questioned.
They say it would mean there
would have been no short-term

justice for Sahar Gul, a child
bride who became the bruised
and bloodied face of women's
rights in Afghanistan when it
emerged that her in-laws had
kept her in a basement for six
months after her arranged mar-
riage, tortured her with hot
irons, and ripped out her finger-
nails.
Her in-laws were sentenced
to 10 years in prison - an out-
come that never would have been
possible if Gul's relatives were
unable to testify.
Kimberley Motley, who repre-
sented Gul, called the new legis*
lation a "catastrophic nightmare
for women's rights" in AfghaniW
stan and goes against the nation'sg
constitution and Shariah law.

Strengthening LGBTQ support
The 'U' should fortify and increase advocacy programs on campus
ast Saturday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced the
federal government would mandate that additional marriage benefits
be accessible to same-sex couples who are legally married, regardless
of whether their marriage is recognized in their home state. Granting new
legal protections to same-sex couples is a profound and commendable
development in the gay rights movement. However, LGBTQ citizens face
many other serious obstacles that don't garner nearly as much attention
as marriage equality. Many LBGTQ youths and adults alike are faced with
serious issues such as bullying, inclusion and depression on a daily basis. In
order to fully support its LGBTQ students and faculty, the University must
promote awareness and take concrete action from relief of these inequalities.

Love thy community

The new policy - revealed during a Human
Rights Campaign event in New York - ensures
that same-sex couples will be allowed equal
rights concerning legal matters such as filing
for bankruptcy, prisoner visitation and federal
benefit programs. These programs will include
death and educational benefits to the spouses of
police officers and firefighters killed in action.
Holder's announcement mirrors a growing
trend in the United States in support of
marriage equality. Same-sex marriage is now
legal in 17 states and just last year the Defense
of Marriage Act was deemed unconstitutional
by the U.S. Supreme Court. These actions
taken by the Obama adtninistrations and states
throughout the country are highly admirable.
Ironically, the Department of Justice's
extension of benefits to same-sex couples
is technically illegal in the 31 states that
constitutionally prohibit gay marriage,
including Michigan. However, in the 2012 State
of the State survey, 56 percent of respondents
indicated that they supported same-sex
marriage. Since the majority of Michiganders
are in favor, and the Obama administration
is mandating that federal benefits be given
to married same-sex couples, it's illogical for
Michigan to continue opposing gay marriage.
The ban needs to be overturned and same-sex

marriage legalized in the state.
The University has done much to support its
LGBTQ community,butcould improve itsefforts.
Organizations, like the office of Institutional
Equity, were created in order to protect students
and faculty from discrimination. Family housing
is available to married same-sex couples and
domestic partnerships. The University also offers
gender-neutral housing in its undergraduate
dormitories through the Gender Inclusive Living
Experience learning-community, created for
students who do not identify with restrictive
gender roles. But gender-neutral housing is only
available to those in GILE, and should be further
expanded.Onlyhaving2spots is notenough, and
not only should the number of spots increase, but
their location as well. tntegratinggender-neutral
housing in other dormitories would provide
more opportunities for students to join the many
other learning communities housing offers. To
address serious issues that LGBTQ individuals
face, more programs should be offered through
CAPS and the Spectrum center. Currently, there
are relatively few psychological help services for
LGBTQ members, and those that do exist are not
advertised well. The University needs to raise
further awareness of the inequalities that affect
LGBTQ students and faculty, and fortify the
advocacy programs that already exist.

that are sold by individuals who iden-

Gaining a new perspective

Toning down the passion

Living in a Detroit suburb my entire life has
given me a bit of an outsider's view of the city.
I grew up knowing about the problems of the
city, the hidden danger that the city harbored
and the major events the city had to offer. The
media has always negatively portrayed Detroit.
Consequently, my knowledge of and exposure
to the city as a child was limited to the few
excursions my family made into the city,
primarily for sportingevents, the Thanksgiving
Day Parade and the obligatory Lafayette Coney
Island hot dog. Though situated a mere 25
minutes from the city my entire life, I didn't
know much more about it than what I saw on
the news.
Upon joining the student body at the
University, Detroit seemed "trendy." Everyone
was doing service-learning work in Detroit,
and I didn't get it. Why Detroit? Why now? I
was extremely skeptical of the entire ordeal as I
felt it perpetuated this idea of the white-savior
complex, and I didn't know if I would ever want
to be involved in something like that.
During January of my freshman year, I
was coaxed into being a site leader for Detroit
Partnership Day. I had absolutely no clue what
I was getting into, with the exception of the
fact that I'd be joined by about 1,400 of my
peers in Detroit. I wasn't sure what difference
I could make in one day. I was a bit reluctant
to be involved in something I wasn't sure I
supported, but decided to give it a chance.'
Two months later, DP Day finally rolled
around, and at 6:30 a.m., I rose with the sun.
I spitefully piled on layers upon layers of
clothing, grabbed a cup of coffee in the eerily
quiet Michigan Union and walked to meet
the rest of my peers who were volunteering
with me.
I volunteered at Neighbors Building
Brightmoor that day, and was pleasantly
surprised by how much I enjoyed my
experience. Five other students and I worked
with a man who told us all about his journey
to Detroit 30 years ago and how he fell in love
with the city. His dedication and his care really
inspired me. The work I did was tiring and
tedious, but the impact that man made on me
that day has stayed with me ever since.
What I realized during that tine was that
it's not about the amount of siding I moved or
how clean the alley looked after we finished

our work for the day, but the relationships I
was able to forge during the experience that
made DP Day a highlight of my freshman year.
I realized that I was looking at DP Day from
the wrong angle. DP Day is about more than
just spending your Saturday volunteering in
Detroit; it's about taking active steps and taking
into account that service-learning is as much
about receiving as it is giving. Though I was the
one volunteering, I felt a bit guilty about how
good I felt after doing so. Was that supposed to
happen? Was I doing something wrong?
One year later, I am now on the Major Events
Team of the Detroit Partnership and have a new
perspective, which enables me to see an entirely
differentsideofwhatDPDaylookslike.WhatI've
cometoappreciateisthatthe DetroitPartnership
truly is about building mutually beneficial
partnerships. If this happened to me, I have no
doubt it is also happeningto many others. What
ostensiblybeganas a "chore" hasmorphed intoa
labor of love.
The approach the Detroit Partnership
takes toward creating these relationships is
intentional. The group researches potential
sites first and foremost. After that, applications
are sentto Detroit-based organizations seeking
their participation. If the organizations are
interested, they decide whether they'd like
volunteers to work with them to achieve some
of their goals. The Detroit Partnership works
carefully to let these organizations articulate
specifically what help they need and to match
that need with available resources. If we can't
accommodate their needs for the specific event,
we work to find other ways, such as one-time
programs or weekly programs to involve these
organizations. Doing this really enforces the
sustainability of these relationships.
with the hope of creating your own
connections, I encourage you to join me -
and the rest of the Detroit Partnership - in
volunteering on DP Day. Be one of the 1,400
University students who join forces to serve the
community, learn from one another and create
meaningful relationships along the way. Don't
think of it as one day, but rather a step toward
familiarizing yourself with the city beyond
what you see in the news. Sign up to volunteer
at thedetroitpartnership.org.

O Sunday, the Big 12
suspended Oklahoma State
sophomore star basketball
player Marcus
Smart for three
games due to an
altercation with
a Texas Tech fan
named Jeff Orr on
Feb. 8. Toward the

Ben Wallace during the infamous
"Malice at the Palace."
While this is, thankfully, the
first time we've seen Smart actually
lay hands on someone else, his
frustrations have been expressed
publicly in recent weeks - he was
caught kicking a chair during a win
against West Virginia last month.
Smart obviously made a mistake.
His emotions got the best of him
amid the difficult stretch of games
his team has gone through - Okla-
homa State has a disappointing 4-6
conference record. And I tlhiak it
can be universally agreed upon that
there is no circumstance where shov-
ing someone - whether it be another
player, a coach or a fan - is appropri-
ate. Smart, at age 19, is a public figure
and an all but guaranteed top-10 pick
in the upcoming NBA draft thisJune.
He has to hold himself to a high stan-
dard. End of story.
But we also shouldn't let Orr's role
go unnoticed. Sure, he apologized,
saying, "My actions last night were
inappropriate and do not reflect
myself or Texas Tech - a university
Ilove dearly."
However his original action -
to call Smart a "piece of crap" in
that setting - was pure coward-
ice. There's an uneven playing field
between players and fans in sports,
the producer and the consumer -
especially in college athletics. And
that holds even truer atnbig Division I

In defense of
January and
bad movies

"January is Hollywood's ver-
sion of sharting on the wall."
That's a word-for-word recap
of something I thought about,
said out loud and then tweeted
a little bit over a month ago

Crosses tries its
hand in "softcore"
synth punk
By HANNAH WEINER
DailyArts Writer
In pictures, China Moreno
has a big black goatee, spiky hair
and black t-shirts studded with
intense graph-
ics. So, from
these pictures, C.
it's not hard
to deduce that
Moreno enjoys Crosses
heavy metal
music and, in Self-released
fact, sings for
heavy metal
bands.
In his previous band,
Deftones, Moreno's vocals
pierced tracks with names like
"Nosebleed," "Knife Prty" and
"Rats!Rats!Rats!" From these
track titles, it's also not hard to
deduce that Moreno's voice has
a distinctive scream and growl
familiar to the genre.
That's why Crosses' debut
album, ttt, feels relatively soft
- even tender, at points. Loaded
with euphoric, glowing synths
and gently echoing vocals, tracks
like "trophys," "Thholoyghst"

and "Nineteen Ninety Four"
aim to dilute a hardcore sound,
boiling it down to slower beats
and unremarkable lyrics. Found
in the middle of the album,
these songs slow the momentum
and intensity of ttt but also
sonically gain complexity,
showing Moreno's versatility as
a vocalist. Essentially, Moreno is
saying, "Hey, I can do more than
scream." And he's right - his
voice can soothe, too.
But while the calmer songs
serve as the crux of ttt, the open-
ing tracks aim to ease hardcore
listeners into an ultimately (and
relatively, of course) "softcore"
album. "This is a Trick" and
"Telepathy" toe the line of emo-
punk revival, generating a sound
that could identify itself as "pro-
gressively emo." Yet, the third
track, "Bitches Brew" ends on a
screaming note, nodding toward
the hardcore listeners and thank-
ing them. But, it's exactly at this
point where the album appears
to muddy its sonic identity - and
not in an edgy, genre-mixing
way. Moreno's screams seem to
indicate confusion, both on part
of the listeners and the band:
"What genre is this? What sound
are we going for? Is this new or
old? Are we Deftones or are we
Radiohead?"
The perplexity probably stems

from a constantly changing tone
and shape. At points, the album
fuses hardcore energy into a
sound that feels less abrasive
than a metal production from
Deftones. At other points, it feels
as if Moreno senses a pressure
from his previous heavy metal
influences, channeling that
anxiety into screams that don't
quite make sense in terms of the
album's progression.
ttt doesn't repulse, nor does it
attract. Instead, it confuses - it
draws in a certain audience and
then throws a curveball, refusing
to neatly fit into one sound or the
other. Just as you feel comfort-
able in melodically pleasing, mild
tracks, a harsh driving guitar will
interrupt you, and then revert
back to an acoustic guitar ("Nine-
teen Eighty Seven"). Moreno has
found a new, serene tone that
suits his voice - perhaps he just
needs to embrace it and let go of
his Deftones persona.
It's a noble effort from a band
that badly wants to strip itself
of hardcore connotations and
enter the realm of synth-y, emo-
fueled music. But, the generation
that grew up with Relient K and
Hellogoodbye have (generally)
matured, losing the need for ang-
sty, atmospheric electro-pop, dis-
regarding albums like ttt along
the way.

my mind
moments before it happened.
If I had to guess, the reasoning
stems from the sudden
perceived drop in quality of
content hitting theaters weeks
after studios are done parading
around their prestige babies,
getting ready to purge all the
shit (ideas) they hope will
be flushed and forgotten in
the looming shadow of Oscar
season. Given the rest-stop-
bathroom-level lack of effort
wafting from every crevice in
last month's box office slate,
it's a surprise Ann Arbor
moviegoers weren't advised
to bring along plungers when
venturing out to catch a new
release at Rave or Quality 16.
Enough. All poop-related
imagery and crappy sense of
humor aside, the point emerges.
It's understood that January is
the calendar equivalent of Hol-
lywood's white flag, and in the
eyes of most sane audiences,
movies released in those 31
days are unanimously deemed
inconsequential wastes of time
and money. But what if that's
not always a bad thing? What
if January is the metaphorical
manure patty we must toss into
the flames to keep our film-
oven burning?
It's an interesting question -
one I posed when running the
early stages of this column by
one of my closest friends. Like
most skeptics, her response
was a resounding "Please stop
saying 'manure patties' out
loud." So I'll convince you
guys like I convinced her -
with cold. hard. feels* (the
phrase "cold. hard. feels" is
a registered trademark of @
NotAkshaySeth).
Before we begin, it's
important to establish some
context. Think: When was the
last time you sat down with a
group of friends and spent more
than 15 minutes discussing a
movie? And I'm not talking
about cursory declarations of
"Oh my god, give (insert name)
an Oscar right now" or "Oh
my god, give (insert name) a
plunger right now." I mean
actually discussing - direct
quotations flying around
everywhere, references to
specific scenes, inside jokes
gradually peeking out through
natural bends in conversation.
In short, the type of talk that
finds you comparing seemingly
unrelated films, and in the
process, discovering opinions

Roberts keeps it cool and classic

By ADAM THEISEN
Daily Arts Writer
While mostly a stranger to the
American charts, Sam Roberts
will sound familiar to those who
grew up in the
Detroit suburbs
and were able
to catch the Lo-Fantasy
radio signals
that were Sam Roberts
beamed from Band
across the river
from Canada. Paper Bag
The Juno
Award winner
has been featured on professional
hockey TV broadcasts and his
singles like "Brother Down" and
"Them Kids" have garnered solid
radio play north of the border.
With his most recent album,
Lo-Fantasy, Roberts proves that
there will always be a place in the
music world for throwback rock
'n' roll.
Roberts' style is character-
ized by charismatic, catchy
vocals and prominent guitar
work designed to fill arenas.
There are plenty of "whoa-oh-
oh"s and bouncy, active drums.
At its worst, this sound can be
uninteresting and grating, but at
its best it rocks with energy and
power. The first single, "We're
All in This Together," is inof-
fensively built for radio. Roberts
could've written a catchier hook,
especially when it's repeated so
often, but the song somehow
finds a way to stick in your head
for days on end.
The album's highlight is the
third track, "Human Heat," the
fastest and toughest rocker on
Lo-Fantasy. Energetic guitars
pound and Roberts's voice is
nice and loud. The song probably
isn't quite enough to be a cross-
over hit, but don't be surprised if
you hear it atla sports stadium in

the future.
After "Human Heat," the
album settles down into a softer
groove.;A misguided, fad-chasing
disco experiment is followed
by "Angola," which could be
a breezy, enjoyable, walking-
down-the-street-on-a-sunny-day
kind of song if the lyrics weren't
so dark ("Listen to the gunshots
echo through the treetops").
But when the heavy, fuzzy
guitars arrive, they lend a very
effective and complimenting
cover of darkness to the track.
Roberts and his band do a great
job of arranging guitars and
drums to achieve the desired
mood or pace for their songs,
showing that even seemingly
straightforward rockers can
hold surprises. Roberts expertly
crafts crescendos and keeps
the songs twisting and turning
into different territory; the first
minute of each track rarely
sounds the same as the first.
The second half of the album
is a great batch of singer-song-
writer rock songs - often memo-
rable, smiley and fun. None of
the band members really take a
back seat; everyone is active and
letting loose. The last stretch is

back; it's music to listen to while
drinking a margarita. There are
more keyboards present and the
band gives the songs a little more
breathing room. The music is
relaxing even if it's not too musi-
cally challenging. Sometimes
Lo-Fantasy loses its momentum
when Sam Roberts gets a little
too experimental, when it's obvi-
ous that he's trying to be more
than just a rocker, but nothing
is ever terrible, just occasionally
overdone and bland. Regardless,
listeners should be left satisfied.
Good ol'
rock 'n' roll.
Lo-Fantasy is a difficult album
to define. It's groovy and charis-
matic, but neither heavy nor soft.
It's just solid music, a group of
talented people coming together
to create well-crafted songs. Sam
Roberts Band is the type of artist
that often gets 'dismissed - not
poppy enough for Top 40, not hip
enough for the critics - but there
will always be a sizable audience
for good music like this.

'Les Revenants'
reinvents zombies

French series
presents a fresh
take on the undead
By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
DailyArts Writer
If you've been watching ABC
lately, you might have noticed
some cryptic ads for its new televi-
sion series "Resurrection." While
I can't speak for the quality of the
networks latest attempt at a dra-
matic hint, I can give a glowing
recommendation to the French
series it's based off of: "Les Rev-
enants," or "The Returned."
Set in a small mountain
town, "Les Revenants" follows
a group of seemingly unrelated
people who have come back
from the dead, unchanged
since their deaths. Those that
have "returned" seem perfectly
healthy and have no memory of
being dead. They do, however,
have some rather suspicious
characteristics, as they don't
sleep and have voracious
appetites.
But typical zombie story this is
not. Those that have "returned"
are not so concerned with how
they actually came back, but
rather the focus of the show is on
their struggle to return to their
old lives and loved ones who have
done their best to move on from
their deaths.
15-year-old Camille, who died
in a bus accident on a school trip
four years prior, returns home

to find her parents separated -
driven apart by her death - and
her twin sister Lena, now 19, a
hard-drinking misfit suffering9
from severe guilt after faking
sick to stay home the day of the
accident and surviving.
Next comes the little boy
Victor, who was killed along with
the rest of his family in a home
invasion 30 years prior. Victor
definitely fulfills the creepy little
kid requirement, as he hardly
says a word and also seems to
possess more mystical ability
than any of the other "returned."
He forms a close relationship
with Laure, a nurse who survived
a brutal attack some years earlier.
Then there's Serge, a serial
killer who terrorized the town
by murdering several women and
eating their internal organs. He
is only stopped when he himself
is murdered. Serge stays with his
older brother Toni, a bartender
who's been trying to keep his
brother's dark secrets in the past.
And then there is Simon, per-
haps the most interesting of the
"returned." Simon was a bride-
groom set to marry the pregnant
Adele, the love of his life, when he
died ten years prior. Simon tries
to reunite with Adele, but finds
she is soon to be married to local
Gendarmerie captain Thomas,
,who has become a de facto father
to his daughter Chloe.
There are many more
"returned," but we have yet to
hear their stories.
Concurrent with all these
plotlines are mysterious power

outages and the ever-decreasing
water level of the town's
reservoir, revealing the remains
of the village that had been
flooded decades before, along
with several dead animals.
"The Returned" exists in
a uniquely dark atmosphere,
playing as both a surrealist
thriller and a soul-wrenching
tragedy. Yes, there are moments
that send shivers down your
spine and make you jump in
fright. But what stays with you
after the screen has gone dark
is grief. It explores the ways
in which people experience
mourning and death, how they
are fundamentally changed by it,
but in a way remain the same.
From the music and
cinematography to the pacing
and plot, everything works in
conjunction to create a haunting,
sophisticated sense of ambiguity.
Even the setting, a small isolated
town in the Alps, leaves the
viewer questioning whether or
not they can trust this reality.
The only worrying aspect of
"The Returned" is its similarity
to a show like "Lost." For every
one question answered in the
most base of terms, ten more rise
up, until it seems like there's no
possible way producers will be
able to come up with a satisfy-
ing ending. Oh well, it's a good
enough show to take the risk on.
With only eight episodes in
season one, "The Returned" is
perfect for a weekend binge. Plus
watching things with subtitles
makes you smarter. It's a fact.

Star-studded cast can't
save 'Spoils of B abylon'

ByMADDIETHOMAS
Daily TV/New Media Editor
"The Spoils of Babylon" is
"nothing less than a masterpiece,"
according to Eric Jonrosh, the
story's fictional
author and
creator. In this
parody of the The SpiIis
melodramatic
miniseries of of Babylon
the 1970s and
'80s, Will Ferrell IFC
plays Jonrosh, a
pretentious and overweight drunk
who graces the silver screen with
his epic novel-turned-miniseries.
With purposely-laughable
production quality, ridiculous
costumes and a semi-incestuous
romance at its heart, "Spoils"
definitely shows promise as a
satire. In terms of actual laughs,
though, it doesn't quite live up to
its "epic" reputation.
Jonas Morehouse (Tim
Robbins, "The Shawshank
Redemption") is apoor oil driller
who lives in middle-of-nowhere
Texas with his daughter, Cynthia
(Kristen Wiig, "Bridesmaids").
A hardworking optimist, Jonas

spends every day in the field,
searching for oil so he can save
his estate and family. One day
he comes across an orphan boy
named Devon (Tobey Maguire,
"The Great Gatsby") and, out
of the goodness of his heart,
adopts him as his own. As Devon
integrates into the family, a
forbidden romance between he
and his adoptive sister begins to
blossom. "The Spoils of Babylon"
follows Cynthia and Devon
through the ups and downs of
their love affair over the course
of several decades.
The performances in "Spoils"
are undoubtedly the highlight
of the series. The humor is right
in Wiig's wheelhouse. Like in
"Saturday Night Live" 's "Cali-
fornians" sketch, her exagger-
ated facial expressions and
body movements make a perfect
match for the melodramatic par-
ody. Maguire also delivers a sur-
prisingly commendable comedic
performance, playing a char-
acter he describes as a satirical
version of Nick Carraway from
"The Great Gatsby." Even the
more "serious" guest stars, like
Val Kilmer and Tim Robbins, are
totally game, most notably the
criminally underused Michael
Sheen, who plays Wiig's hus-
band in one episode and may be
the best part of this entire series.
Unfortunately, great perfor-
mances aren't enough to sup-
port a flimsy script. The campy
humor succeeds in parodying a
genre, but fails to consistentiy
reach heights that transcend
the context of that parody. Per-
haps some of the humor is lost on
me, a millennial college student
who wasn't even alive during the
height of miniseries popularity,
but the entire six-episode collec-
tion feels a bit stretched - like
an overlong "SNL" sketch that
could use a caffeine injection.
The funniest moments
occur when the show embraces
absurdity - like when Cynthia
and Lady Anne (voiced by
Carey Mulligan, "Inside Llewyn
Davis"), who is a mannequin and
Devon's wife, have a showdown
over brunch at the Morehouse
estate. Never mind the fact that
she is literally a hunk of plastic

and no one acknowledges it; the
permanently placid expression
on Lady Anne's face while she
and Cynthia swap insults is
hilarious when juxtaposed with
Wiig's famously dynamic face.
The show grows tiresome
when it fails to provide a creative
punch line to overused parody
tropes. Episode three features a
drawn out black and white scene
during which Devon tries to kick
his heroin addiction. In episode
four, Jessica Alba trots around in
lingerie as "Dixie Melonworth."
There are too many already-
parodied situations like these
that fail to accomplish the
ultimate goal of breathing a new
life into an old genre.
A spoiled
opportunity.
"The Spoils of Babylon" is
frustrating mostly because it
feels like a wasted opportunity.
With its massive amount of star
power and relatively low stakes
(considering it is only 6-episodes
long and not necessarily looking
to get picked up for another
season) one would hope for
riskier content. Writer-director
duo Andrew Steele and Matt
Piedmont (both alums of the
"SNL" writers' room) are funny
when they take the content to
bizarre levels. Otherwise, "The
Spoils of Babylon" is merely a
parody of a genre few people
remember or really care about.
At only about three hours
in length total, "Spoils" is
made up of six 22-minute
installments, and that is just
the right amount. Is it worth
binge-watching at home while
cleaning your room? Probably.
Does it call for more works of its
kind? Probably not. "The Spoils
of Babylon" is a fun attempt at
parody, but after its short stint
on the air, the comedy well has
run dry. As Will Ferrell's Eric
Jonrosh reminds us in the final
installment, "When the wine is
gone, it's time to go home. That's
the rule."

Another Curling Canadian

M' signs nine recruits

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson has been curling, and
not just in the weight room.
He's participated in the
Olympic sport that most of
Americans can't quite figure
out, and despite his storied
success in ice hockey, he labels
it one of his favorite events in
this year's Olympic Winter
Games. Though the Canadian
men's curling team has posted
just a 1-2 mark in Sochi thus far,
Berenson remains intrigued.
The game of curling is most
popular in the prairie provinces
of Canada, such as Alberta, Man-
itoba and Saskatchewan. From
time to time, Berenson par-
ticipated in throwing rocks and
sweeping in front of them him-
self, and has always found solace
in the long-time Canadian sport.
"Being a Canadian, I think
curling is a great event,"
Berenson said with a smile. "But
that's not as popular down here."
Despite curling's relevance in
the United States, or lack there
of, the sport has been rooted in
the Michigan hockey program
for more than a decade. When
the Wolverines played in the
Central Collegiate Hockey
Association, before joining the
Big Ten Conference this season,
Berenson would take his team
curling when it would travel to
play Alaska-Fairbanks.
The venue was just half a
mile from the hockey rink in
Fairbanks, and an instructor
would always show the team
the basics of curling. Berenson
recalls everyone having an
enjoyable experience.
"It's amazing," Berenson said.
"It's like shuffleboard on ice.
There's a great skill to it. There's
a great touch."
His mom and dad both curled

Despite the loss of the class
that changed a program, the
future doesn't look bleak for the
Michigan women's soccer team.
On Tuesday, Michigan
coach Greg Ryan answered
looming questions regarding
who would fill the vacant spots
when he announced that nine
recruits committed to play for
the Wolverines this fall: Alyssa
Dillon, Megan Hinz, Danielle
Hogarth, Sarah Jackson, Kendall
Kramer, Courtney Parr, Taylor
Timko, Rubina Veerakone and
Nicole Wilkinson.
The addition of nine recruits,
two more than the 2013 class,
comes as no surprise following a
record-breakingseason.
What does surprise isthe range
of talent this class boasts. Michi-
gan's expectations will be high
next season as Ryan works with
new rotations to keep his aggres-
sive offense and stonewalling
defense con-
sistent. Based
on the acco- "This C

ing class, next a little

"This class
has a little bit
of everything,"
Ryan said in a statement. "We're
adding depth at every position on
the field, but the best part about
this class is that every player is
athletic and skillful.
"We're graduating one of the
most successful senior classes in
our program's history and while
that entire group is irreplace-
able, there's going to be a fierce
competition to fill the spots that
they held."

made an
impressive run to the Elite Eight,
where they fell to No.1 Virginia.
But the run wouldn't have
been possible without the efforts
of the senior class - a class
Ryan says shaped the program
in many ways. The loss sealed
the departure of forward Nkem
Ezurike, the program's all-time
leading scorer and assister, and
left Michigan with big cleats to
fill - seven pairs to be specific.
The incoming class consists
of four mid-

thing. There
g is some
familiarity
among the
upcoming
freshmen that should certainly
help adjust them to collegiate
soccer. Hinz, Hogarth and Parr
played club together on Maryland
United FC, Kramer and Timko on
Vardar and Dillon and Veerakone
on the Michigan Hawks.
"Hopefully we won't annoy
each other too much," Parr said
of Hinz in an interview with
The Washington Post last Sep-
tember. "No, we love each other,
it'll be fun."

Defender Dillon, who led a
defense that limited opponents
to four goals all season, attended
Plymouth High School with
freshman forward Madisson
Lewis. She was also named as a
Michigan High School Athletic
Association All-State first team
selection and Dream Team pick,
and will be Plymouth's captain
this spring.
Currently, the Wolverines have
two goalkeepers - freshman Tay-
lor Bucklin and sophomore Mad-
die Clarfield. Though Bucklin
started every game last season,
time in the net will be more com-
petitive with the addition of goal-
keepers Hinz and Jackson.
Hinz is one of 44 players in
the country to be selected to play
in the National Soccer Coaches
Association of America's All-
American Game in December,
held in Cary, N.C., during the
College Cup.
She also has back-to-back
State Cup championships
(2010-11) under her belt.
Meanwhile Jackson held a 0.813
goals-against average last fall
and was a Massachusetts All-
State All-Star.
Forward Timko is a unique
and well-rounded addition to
Michigan. Not only is she a
forward who scored 39 goals her
junior season, but she also served
as the kicker for her high school's
football team. She was also called
into the ECNL Elite Training
Player Development Program in
2012-13, and 2011.
Hogarth is the other forward
signed for next season, and she
played with Hinz when Maryland
United FC won two straight state
championships.
"We expect several of these
players to make an immediate
impact and add to the culture that
we've built here at Michigan,"
Ryan said.

competitively, and Berenson
took after his parents by
participating in curlinggrowing
up in Regina, Sask. He never
competed on an organized
team, though, as hockey usually
took precedence throughout his
adolescence, but he remembers
learning the game well.
One of his fondest memories
involving curling was watch-
ing the great Garnet Campbell
- a legendary curler from Sas-
katchewan nicknamed "The
Little General" - win the Cana-
dian Curling Championships at
a venue in Berenson's hometown
in 1955. Campbell was the first
native of Saskatchewan to take
home the honor. Both Berenson
and Campbell have since been
inducted into the Canadian
Sports Hall of Fame.
Aside from curling, Berenson

also expressed interest in cross-
country skiing and the biathlon.
He said being from Canada
helps him relate to the Winter
Olympics a bit more closely than
the Summer Games.
There won't be any curling for
Berenson's squad in the foresee-
able future beside spending time
with strength and conditioning
coach Joe Maher. But 5,545 miles
away from Sochi, Michigan will
still get a taste of the Olympics
when it plays on an Olympic-
sized ice arena during this week-
end's two-game series at No. 2
Minnesota. Berenson mentioned
he enjoys watching downhill
skiing because of the speed, and
on the large ice surface in Min-
neapolis, the Wolverines will
have a premier opportunity to
impress their coach with their
own speedy skaters.

After Sunday's game,
Barnes Arico acknowledged
that her team's recent lapses
may have been induced by its
schedule of four games in 10
days. Michigan has lost four
of its previous six games while
many of its players experience
the full grind of the Big Ten
schedule for the first time. But
Barnes Arico takes pride in the
fact that the Wolverines have
shed some of their inexperience
and have been in the thick of
every conference game except a
blowout loss at Nebraska.
"If any team in our conference
thought that we were going to be
in the position where they come
out and Michigan is going to give

"You don't show up, Michigan is
going to beat you. I think we've
been a surprise to alot of people."
As of late, it hasn't been a
surprise when an opponent goes
on a run to shrink a Wolverine
lead. The question isn't if
Michigan will allow a run, but
how it will respond to it.

A POEM:
Sportsing is a thing we like to do,
So join the Daily and you can too.
Maybe basketball is your sport of choice,
Or writing soccer you'll find your voice.
The sports section is the place to be
If you have thoughts on track or hockey.
So come on in, you'll have a ball,
We know how to write about them all.

Wolverines earn first
win in Columbus for

Ohio State men'sbasketballteam's
lineup was announced before it's
game against Michigan's."
The loud, red, blazing streaks
of color lit up the dimmed
arena, and in the beginning of
the first half, the 22nd-ranked
Buckeyes personified the scarlet
pyrotechnics.
Ultimately the scarlet and gray
fireworks faded as the first half
ended, and the 15th-ranked Wol-
verines pushed out (10-2 Big Ten,
18-6 over-
all) to a MICHIGAN 70
70-60 win. OHIO STATE 60
Michigan
knocked down free throws late
in the game to the victory, to give
it its first win in Columbus in 11
years.
The Wolverines trailed early
and often through the first half
but were finally able to chip
away at Ohio State's lead in the
second. Midway through the
second half, freshman guard Zak
Irvin knocked down a 3-pointer,
then sophomore guard Caris
LeVert stole the ball and finished
with a left-handed layup on the
other end.

One minute later, freshman
guard Derrick Walton Jr.
penetrated and got a lay up to
fall after drawing contact. He
knocked down a free throw
to finish the and-1 play giving
Michigan a six-point lead and
momentum it would carry to the
end of the game.
"At the beginning of the game
the pace was kinda frantic," Wal-
ton said. "It kinda slowed down
in the second half I just did a good
job of trying to pick my spots."
The Buckeyes (6-6, 19-6)
dominated the beginning of the
contest, though. Four minutes
in, Ohio State guard Aaron Craft
lobbed a pass to forward Sam
Thompson for an electrifying
alley-oop dunk. Thirty-three
seconds later, after a missed
3-pointer Stauskas, Ohio State
replayed its previous possession,
this time with forward Ross
throwing down a dunk after
gettingsetup.
The Buckeyes pushed their
lead to as many as 10 in the
first half, but Michigan cut the
lead to just four by the time the
team headed to the locker room,
thanks in part to an ensemble
cast that stepped up at the end of
the half.
The Wolverines helped their
cause with big play on the boards
outrebounding Ohio State, 39-27.
Fifth-year senior Jordan Morgan
collected eight rebounds - six on
the offensive side, leading to sec-
ond-chance points for Michigan.
On defense, the Wolverines
focused on eliminating Craft

from the flow of the game. The
senior finished with just eight
points, and Ross did the bulk of
the scoring - finishing with a
game-high 24 points.
"(We tried to) keep Craft the
heck out of there," Beilein said.
"Just get him over there and let
the other four guys play us."
The effort from Ross down
low wasn't enough though -
Ohio State relies on its shoot-
ing to win games. The Buckeyes
came into the game shooting 35.3
percent from beyond the arc,
Tuesday night they went 3-for-20
from deep.
But it was Walton who
knocked down each of his three
foul shots after being fouled
behind the arc in the second half
that pushed Michigan's lead to
10, forcing the Buckeyes to foul.
"If you watched (Walton)
earlier in the season, when he
was coming off screens or doing
anything, his shoulders were
pointed sideways all the time,"
Beilein said. "Now his shoulders
are pointed at the basket, and
he's getting low and he's getting
down hill. It's huge for him to be
able to go north south."
Walton finished with a double-
double, adding 10 rebounds to
his 12 points. Michigan coach
John Beilein said the point
guard became more comfortable
taking over on the court, both by
attacking the basket and vocally
directing the offense.
Michigan went 8-of-8 from
the line in the final minute and
a half to ice the game on its way
to its first win against a ranked
Ohio State team in Columbus in
program history.

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
COLUMBUS - At the
13:41 mark of the second half,
Michigan coach John Beilein
was in desperate need of inspired
play, and it certainly wasn't
comingfrom Glenn RobinsonIII.
Trailing 41-35, the sophomore
forward was just 2-of-9 from
the floor, with most of those
misses coming from ill-advised
jumpers, point-blank misses or
blocked layups. With Robinson's
confidence slipping by the second
in a hostile environment, Beilein
pulled the veteran sophomore for
a freshman.
And Zak Irvin didn't let
the headman down. Over the
next 7:20, with Robinson look-
ing on from the bench, Irvin
appeared in the scorebook
only once, but it was a big
one. His 3-pointer with just
less than 12 minutes remain-
ing narrowed the 15th-ranked
Wolverines' deficit to three.
And by the time he checked
out at the 6:21 mark, Michigan
had a 51-50 lead.
"Obviously that was a big
shot," said fifth-year senior
forward Jordan Morgan. "But
just the energy that he brings to
everyone on the court - it picks
the whole team up."
Irvin's 10 points in 20 minutes
proved more monumental than
it showed on the boxscore as
the Wolverines beat No. 22 Ohio
State, 70-60 - their first win in
Columbus since 2003.
Make no mistake, Irvin's play
wasn't perfect. His matchup

on the defensive end, forward
LaQuinton Ross, scored a
game-high 24 points, and while
many of those baskets can't be
pinned on Irvin, the freshman
did surrender multiple easy
layups.
But it was his play - a breath
of fresh air from a team that was
lacking a real sparkplug - that
seemingly saved Michigan from
losing a game that, given the
way Ohio State played, had no
business losing.
The second-half boost wasn't
the first time Irvin's play was the
difference maker.
"He's done that for us for this
whole stretch of the Big Ten,"
Morgan said.
Tuesday night was the
guard's third consecutive
game scoring in double fig-
ures, coming on the heels of a
19-point performance at Iowa
and a 16-point first half against
Nebraska last week. In early
January, he dropped 15 points
at Minnesota while the teams
key scorers struggled. And even
in low-scoring nights, such as a
three-point affair at Michigan
State, his lone 3-pointer came a
much-needed time.
In fact, it wasn't even the flst
time that he came up huge on
Tuesday night. Seven mindtes
into the contest, the Buckeyes had
turned a 5-5 tie into a 13-5 lead
thanks to an array of highlight-
reel dunks. Parting like the red
sea and failing to hustle back in
transition, Michigan's defensive
lapses had Value City Arena
rocking. Shades of Saturday's loss
to the Hawkeyes flashed through

the building, as it looked like
Ohio State had delivered an early
knockout blow.
Just like the first half,
Irvin replaced a struggling
Robinson in the first half. On
his first offensive possession
of the game, he knocked down
a 3-pointer. It's difficult to
gauge the full magnitude of
a make with so much time to
play, but it was enough to keep
the Wolverines in the game,
where they stayed - despite
a horrendous 32.1-percent
shooting mark in the first half
- until Irvin's second-half
stint.
"He's been a typical freshman
in some ways, but the young man
can make a shot," Beilein said.
"He can just make a shot. He
comes in he just finds the bottom
of the basket ... He just makes
shots."
The freshman's efficient night
in the hostile setting - 2-for-3
from the field and 4-of-5 from
the charity stripe - displayed a
poise matched only by a fellow
freshman, point guard Derrick
Walton Jr., who commanded the
offense to the tune of 13 points, 10
rebounds and six assists in place
of sophomore Spike Albrecht.
And if Robinson's struggles
continue - the sophomore shot
3-for-10 while failing to score in
double figures for the fifth time
in six games - Irvin may find
himself on the floor for more long
stretches of time.
And unlike Walton, if Irvin
keeps shooting like he has, it
would hardly be a simple long-
term project.

8B Ensday February12,2014 The Statement

STAFF
From Pages 4B-5B

A decade ago,Colemancalled for
the creation of an advisory board to
channel input from staff members
to the University administration.
Today, Voices of the Staff is a
organization composed of 120
volunteer members who serve on
smaller project teams to advise the
University's administrators and
build relationships across units.
Tim Kennedy, a. Building
Automation Systems manager, has
been with the University for 26
years and has spent the last nine
involved with Voices.
"Its membership represents a
microcosm of the University so it
really brings in staff from the four
corners of the institution to work
collaboratively on issues that are
most important to staff," Kennedy
said.
In a bright office on the sixth
floor of the Ross School of Business,
Mary Ceccanese, research process
coordinator at the Office of Tax
Policy Research, lights up when
she talks about her participation
experience with the group.
As part of this role on Voices,
Ceccanese helped a business school
professor compile presentations
related to positive workplace
cultures. Soon, Ceccanese started
doing the trainings herself. Now,
she's frequently requested to run
sessions for units across campus,
which often include improvisation,
videos and hands-on activities.
"This has literally changed my
life," Ceccanese said. "Now this
has kicked off almost like a whole
new career for me. Every day, I get
up now and I'm absolutely ecstatic
about what I get to do."
Ceccanese said participation in
Voices not only provided a forum to
influence change at the University,
but also empowerment for staff
members trying to learn and grow
personally and professionally.
"I've become more creative,
more empowered," Ceccanese said.
"I've taken on projects in our office
I never would have dreamed of. I'm
not afraid to take a chance - to try
something new."
Snakebit: The shared services
initiative
While Tyler, Rollins and
Ceccanese had few complaints
regarding the University's
treatment of its employees, the
past four months have been
particularly straining for staff in
many of the University's academic
departments.

Since the University rolled out
the shared services initiative, the
administration has been intensely
criticized for its failure to consult
faculty or staff during most stages
of the process. Shared services - a
component of the Administrative
Services Transformation Project -
will relocate 275 department-level
human resource and finance staff
to a central services center. It is
expected to save about $5 million
annually.
In the fall, 19 LSA department
chairs signed a letter to Coleman
and Provost Martha Pollack
voicing concerns about the
project's equity and transparency.
The letter criticized the University
for implementing the project with
"an aura of secrecy," which caused
anxiety among members of the
staff worried about layoffs and
transfers.
A petition authored by
Engineering Prof. Fawwaz Ulaby,
which gained the signatures of
1,100 University faculty members,
questioned the efficacy of the
model as a way to reduce costs.
Departments also sent a slew of
letters to administrators contesting
the process.
In response, the University
convened a series of meetings
and committees to seek input, but
Coleman has said the University
remains committed to the
initiative.
History Prof. Brian Porter-
Sztcs said what's most alarming
about the initiative is the broader
cultural change, both at the
University and nationally, where
public institutions are beginning
to adopt corporate models of
organizing their employees.
"Instead of seeing employees as
part of an organization, (staff) are
more perceived as interchangeable
parts on an almost factory model,"
Porter-Szfcs said. "Once you do
that, they are then cheaper and you
have at least on a superficial level a
savings of cost."
Porter-Szics said he deems
the cost savings artificial because
they lead to higher turnover, lower
morale and lower productivity.
"I can't tell you how many times

offices after working late, and the

professionals; they are working
like people who are dedicated to
the task of making our department
as successful as it can be. You start
treatingthose people as replaceable

parts who can be moved off site
- if you create that culture- I'd
like to see how many of them
will ever stay late."
HistoryProf. MarisVinovskis
said the shared services rollout
revealed an indifference to the
staff he had never seen before at
the University.
"This used to be a University
I could be proud of the way we
handled our staff," Vinovskis
said, "Today, it isn't. Now, my
hope is this is an anomaly. We
all make mistakes. We all can
do better. But the way it was
handled revealed a side of a
University I wouldn't want to
be proud of, I'm not even sure
I'd want to be part of."
Since the uproar last
semester, the University has
attempted to make-good in
light of the troubled rollout.
Pollack and other officials
involved in the initiative
have vowed to improve
communication and include
faculty and staff in the
process.
In an interview with
The Michigan Daily, Laurita
Thomas, associate vice
president for human resources,j
said staff are ready to move on. 4
"Any change is going to get a
range of reactions and it was clearI
to me as I talked to the 244 that
were impacted by shared services
there was a range of emotions,"
Thomas said. "There was huge
concern (but also) there was huge
excitement among the staff." I
When asked to characterize
the University's communication or
planning related to the initiative,
Thomas deferred, saying, "We
should look forward."
But for Kathleen King, the
History Department's graduate
services coordinator, and other
department-level staff members,
the pain does not subside so quickly.
The pain stems not only from
losing a colleague - whose office
will no longer bustle with students
and faculty wandering in and out
- but also from the broken trust
between staff and the University's
leadership.
King compares the situation
to a snakebite, a term she learned
during her days as a consultant in
the oil and gas industry.
"No amount of effort is going to
fix this. It's a dry hole," she said.
Vinovskis and Porter-Szucs said
they were more optimistic about
the University's ability to mend the



relationship between staff, faculty staff mc

in the fall of 2010, I did every-
thing I could to stand out. As my
friends listened to Rihanna, I
streamed Bullet for my Valentine.
When girls struggled to get past
the no-nonsense debates on what
color nail polish best suited their
skin tones, I jammed with the met-
al-heads. No, I may not have made
a case for myself with the boys, but
I was unique.
Well, so much for that.
In a world that's increasingly
focused on diversity - or a lack of
it - it's remarkable how minimally
diverse we really are. Earlier this
year, a Wall Street Journal report
showed that the top 10 singles on
radio last year were played twice as
often as the top hits from a decade
ago did during their heyday. The
most played song of 2013, "Blurred
Lines," performed by Robin
Thicke, was played 2,053 times a
day on average. More startlingly,
Clear Channel Communications
Inc. tracked over 70 new Top 40
radio stations in the last ten years.
As much as I try to differentiate
de253
myself from the crowd, the rate of
return for a varied taste in music is
far too low. Each time I let Avenged
Sevenfold ring through my laptop
speakers, I hardly receive a second
glance. And if I plug in my head-
phones to indulge in my personal
favorites, then I'm essentially cut-
ting myself off from the outside
world.
There's a sense of community

that comes with popular music.
Pop music is permeable and adapt-
able to any sort of social scenario.
By the transitive property, I can
walk into a party or a club and feel
an immediate connection to the
stranger next to me if we can both
recognize the song being played.
Music is culture, and culture
comes in groups. Culture is recog-
nizable, it's viral and it's what helps
define a generation. Radio stations
and music streaming services will
never lose their appeal as long as
they serve to reinforce the cultural
camaraderie that comes with pop-
ular music - ad revenue notwith-
standing. And if that means playing
the song of the summer for three
months on aloop, then so be it. .
This sense of diversification bias
- the false assumption that we,
as humans, crave more diversity
than we really do - isn't unique
to music. A 2011 study by decision
theorists Jeff Galak, Justin Kruger
and George Loewenstein found
that when people consumed high-
concentrations of anything over
a short period of time, they were
more likely repeat their choices.

TRATIONS BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND
Over time, however, they were
more like to switch out their old
tunes to new ones.
I'm still optimistic. As the line
between pop music and other
genres fades out, musical hits like
"Royals," by Lorde, "Somebody
that I Used to Know," by Gotye and
"Get Lucky," by Daft Punk start to
permeate everyday radio and turn
obscure artists into overnight hits.
It's clear that online media has the
power to keep hit music sound-
ing fresh. There's no doubt that as
generations evolve, the sound of
popular music will evolve, too. On
the other hand, if our community
tends to listen to music that is more
obscure than those songs that are
nationally or internationally trend-
ing, then that obscurity becomes
popular within our own sphere of
existence.
More often than not, we place
ourselves outside the trend. The
trend is seen as something inde-
pendent of our being and the choice
to follow or separate ourselves
from this becomes our autonomous
choice. Slowly though, the trend
becomes us.

quently than in college. And while
I had found that to be majorly true,
despite an embarrassingly dispro-
portionate amount of failure in the
arena of sex and sensuality, I was
hoping that some of them would
turn out to be cool enough to talk
to in a long-term sort of way, as
well.
Which is why I took extra care
that morning when it came to fac-
tor No. 3 - looking good for the
girl. I had class with a cute bru-
nette - let's call her ... Pothos -
every Tuesday and Thursday. She
was attractive with long hair, long
legs and a nice smile, and I suppose
we'd had some interesting conver-
sations - awkwardly at first, and
then more flirtingly and jokingly
as I broke new ground. I had got-
ten her number and invited her
out, but she never responded; I had
mixed up a seven and a five. Later
on, I had suggested we do some-
thing together, but she never com-
mitted. I told myself these mishaps
were not rejections - I just needed
to be more upfront.
I had on a nice red sweater
that had received compliments
from other girls, and a new pair of
brown corduroys that Ihad bought
at H&M in Chicago with my mom
over Thanksgiving break. These
facts are equally if not more impor-
tant to this story than Pothos is
herself: that sweater was sexy.
I packed my books and laptop
into my bag and brought them
downstairs with me. I set them
on the couch and made break-
,fast.- Sometimes I fry an egg op

two while I make oatmeal. Other
times, I just eat cereal. That day,
I had strawberry pop-tarts and
mini-wheats. I always drink whole
milk. Looking back, this seems rel-
evant to everything: I drink whole
milk.
For whatever reason, I had more
time to kill that morning, so I sat
on the couch while eating, watch-
ing SportsCenter and thinking
about the cute brunette, Pothos.
Are dates clich6? Should I just
invite her to a party and try to get
with her? I didn't like the colors
she used to paint her nails, though;
if it didn't work out, it would all be
OK.
When I'd seen Pothos on the
first day of classes, I'd thought,
"There's no way I'm going to sit
here all semester and not talk to
her at least once. Even ifI strike out
horribly." At the time, I was trying
to be braver about the whole meet-
ing girls thing. They're undoubt-
edly frightening and rejection is a
nightmare, but I was discovering
that it's better to strikeout than
to wonder what would have hap-
pened had I just taken a swing at
it. Gotta get your at-bats, I told
myself.
I rinsed off my plate and bowl
and put them in the dishwasher
because I'm not an asshole like my
housemates.
Was Pothos too hot for me?
Was being "too hot" a thing? My
friends and I debated this notion
numerously. They wanted to know
what she looked like. I gave them,
her name and they deconstructcd

her profile pictures in the most
shallow, banal and sexist of ways,
which I resented on principle but
admittedly partook in regularly.
I told myself I was a good guy. At
least, I'm not a bad guy. That's
something.
I locked my front door and went
to class.
And ... that's pretty much it.
Everything described leading
up to class was maybe 1 percent of
the thoughts that were bouncing
around in my head that morning.
Not that I had a notably sizable
amount of thoughts on that day.
It's just that people have a lot of
thoughts all the time, constantly.
Perhaps those thoughts, specifi-
cally, were unique to that Tuesday
morning. But in other ways, they
weren't at all. Pothos becomes
Aphrodite next Tuesday, Hera
the day after, or maybe even just a
plain old Jessica. The individuals
themselves don't really matter, but
my pursuit of them certainly does,
In the end, routine becomes

6B Wednesday, February 12, 2014 // The Statement
The third culture kid: Between homelands
by Rachel Premack

The streets of Ann Arbor are covered in
gray, squelching slush. The same picture
goes for my hometown, less than an hour
away.
However, LSA sophomore Ayo Akinokun
- who has Nigerian parents, spent time
in Norway and France and attended high
school in Dubai - recalls the warm traffic-
congested streets in his home of Nigeria.
The cars often move so slowly you can buy
cookies on the highway.
LSA junior Thibaut Dupuy flies back to-
Istanbul every break since his French par-
ents moved there from Washington, D.C.
There, what he sees is a liberal city in a con-
servative country, where mosques, syna-
gogues and churches can all be on the same
street. Fully veiled women tromp down
sidewalks next to others in miniskirts.
And in Shanghai, where LSA sophomore
Gabriel Meredith calls his home, the envi-
ronment is increasingly wealthy and glitzy.
When he was younger, he visited a hec-
tic market with vendors hawking bootleg
DVDs. Now, there's a flagship Prada store,
where that hardscrabble collection of shops
once stood.
"I like the Shanghai where you wake
up early on a Saturday and go to the park
and see old people playing badminton and
doing tai chi," Meredith said. "I guess the
Shanghai that's a lot more quiet, relaxed,
leafy streets. And a lot of it's still there. It's
always gonna be there. it's just harder for
us to see."
Change and instability is a defining
theme in the lives of many "third culture"
kids, a small but increasingly more visible
subset of the University's student body.
The term "third culture kid" is new and
somewhat unknown. Coined in the 1950s
in the book, "Third Culture Kids: Growing
Up Among Worlds" by American sociolo-
gist David C. Pollack, it's defined as a child
who experienced a "significant part of his
or her developmental years outside the par-
ents' culture" and as a result does not iden-
tify completely with any one culture. It's
similar in many ways to the term "global
nomad," though this usually refers to a per-
son who typically has loosened their ties to
their home country and work abroad.
I talked to seven students who identify
as third culture kids. Collectively, these
students have at some point called Zambia,
France, the United Arab Emirates, China,
Norway, Turkey, Nigeria Switzerland and
vw- the U.S. their home.
It's a bit gimmicky too. When Iasked LSA
juniors Thibaut Dupuy and Leslie Sommer
if they had heard of the term, they burst out
laughing. LSA sophomore Brendan Wu said
the term has been used by Buzzfeed and
other Internet hotspots for someone who
simply associates with international cul-
ture.
But the idea of a childhood spent in a cul-

ture different from one's parents is not new them. For Li, it could be seen as a hindrance.

single year. There's always a constant flow
of everyone coming in and leaving," he
said. "You get kind of used to the system of
constant change and meeting new people
and being forced to understand different
people's experiences but at the same time
joining together to build an experience
together."
Wu, however, said he does not necessar-
ily prefer the company of third culture kids.
He said he's often pressured to hang out
with Chinese Americans and Asian Ameri-
cans, but doesn't deem it as necessary.
"After that we're still very different
sometimes," Wu said. "Like Gabriel (Mere-
dith) and I are friends partly because we've
had similar experiences and things we've
both experienced, like living in China, but
there's a lot more than that."
It connects to his idea of nationality.
"I always say things like ethnicity or
where you're from and stuff is just a state
of mind," Wu said. "Even if you've grown
up in America all your life but you really
associate with another part of the world
or something, there's nothing wrong with
saying part of you is a manifestation of
that."
Finding one country to identify with is
often a challenge, and several of the stu-
dents said even that could be fluid.
Sommer said she rejected her Swiss
background while attending a high school
in Switzerland, noting the stereotypes of
a Swiss person with a smile: being anal,
reserved and on-time. She was quicker
to name herself Czech, her mother's
nationality. But in the U.S., she said, she's
embraced that she is a Swiss person.
"Now I feel like I'm becoming my own
person," Sommer said. "I feel like every
experience I have I learn and I develop
and I would say being Swiss is a part of
me. I realized that I am a Swiss citizen
and I will always be Swiss. However,
that's not how I would define myself. I
wouldn't limit myself as just being Swiss."
Sommer, who spent her childhood sum-
mers in South Carolina, sees the fleeting
nature of a national identity as something
that goes beyond third culture kids.
"I feel like we're part of a new generation
that's gonna fully get rid of this national-
ism that we used to have. We're going to be
able to move from country to country and
culture to culture and live together with-
out identifying first as a nationality."
Dupuy echoed Sommer, adding the shift
could help define a generation;
"I think that identifying with more than
one culture makes identifying in today's
world special," Dupuy said. "In the world
that we live in today, we're going to work
with more people that don't look like us,
don't speak the same languages as us and
didn't grow up like us. I dont know if you
could necessarily say that in the past."

"Cultures are very complex and there's
a lot of things you can't quite understand
unless you've grown up in that culture,"
Akinokun said. "Like in a coffee shop here
in the U.S., there might be something about
whether you should say hi to someone
before sitting down or wait until everyone
is seated before saying hi. Things like that
differ. It's just weird having to map out in
my mind where I am andwhat I'm sup-
posed to be doing."
The culture shock stretches beyond sub-
tle social norms, too.
LSA sophomore Jenny Li, who spent
most of her childhood in Zambia, is Chi-
nese but said her family assumed she would
get good grades and go to an American col-
lege. In her school in Zambia though, her
teachers and classmates, who hailed from
places like the U.S., Britain and South Afri-
ca, accepted B's and C's.
These cultural differences, among the
students I interviewed, helped develop

Dupuy --the French student
who grew up in Washington, D.C. - said
this was especially shocking considering
the diverse nature of the student body. It
has the eighth largest international student
population out of all U.S. universities and
represents 130 countries.
Meredith said he bonds most quickly
with third culture kids, even those who are
neither Chinese nor American. Half-white
and half-Chinese, hedoesn't fit in with
international Chinese students, who see
him as white. But he's not American either.
"It's the experience of living in a ridicu-
lously diverse situation with a school with
people from actually all over the world," he
said. "(There's) the idea that diversity is in
a way our life, in a way we kind of crave it."
Meredith paused, considering his home
in Shanghai, his father's birthplace on a
Michigan farm and the American boarding
school where he came of age.
"One of the biggest similarities is the
idea that all international schools just

eople call them
Michigan Men.
From a
tract of wilderness,
they molded one of
the nation's premier
institutions of higher
education. Even today,
their names grace the
University's academic
stone and brick edifices,
a permanent testament
to their enduring
achievements and legacy.
These luminaries and
legends are the professors,
students, researchers and
coaches who first number
among the victors.
But across a history as
storied as the University's,
the imagined narrative of
the Michigan Men is far from
nuanced.
On campus, many of the
University's 28,500 employees
are hard to find. Most don't have
offices or professional webpages.
They don't have published
work on reserve at the Shapiro
Undergraduate Library. Their daily
triumphs won't likely find their way
into the bound volumes of University
history.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman may spin the Cube to start
the day, but in many ways, it's the
University's regular employees who
truly make the University move.
Each morning, bus drivers rev up their
engines to shuttle students to class. Staff
warm loaves of French toast as custodians
push their cleaning carts quietly past
the doors of sleeping students. Others
ready projectors for lecture, calm students
overwhelmed by a deadline or treat patients
at the University Health System.
These are the staff of the University of
Michigan.
Jack Tyler: More than ajob
Two-thirds of the way through the
dinner shift, East Quad has run out
of Broccoli Bake. At the entryway, a
small electronic card reader shows
the night's tally of diners creeping
closer and closer to 1,000.
It's Monday, which
means Jack Tyler is
manning. the greeter's
stand. Tyler swipes quickly,
his arm rocking back and
forth; sliding the yellow
cards in a rhythm
refined over a couple of
decades. It's easy to
get caught up in the
speed and pattern
- swipe, return,
swipe, punch.

swipe.
But for Tyler, the five seconds it takes for
a student to fumble with her wet mittens or
dig for his wallet is just enough time to utter
a greeting.
"Hey man, how are you doing?" Tyler calls
out from behind his stand.
He's beaming. It's not always because he
knows the student - though oftentimes he
does - but at Jack Tyler's East Quad card
station, greetings are delivered like he's been
waiting for you all day.
Most times, students reciprocate. When
Tyler smiles widely, his thin moustache
stretching above his upper lip, it's hard not to
smile back. Many know him by name.
"I think it's how I treat the student body,"
Tyler said. "This is part of me - it's not
something I make up. I started saying I'm
going to treat them like young adults, not like
my kids and that's the way I treat them."
With 1,000 students funneling past his
stand every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday,
Tyler said he tries hard to learn names, but he
can easily recognize the faces of his regular
customers. And he knows who's on the sports
teams; Jack loves athletics.
ApartfromastintawayatcollegeinJackson,
Mich., Tyler has lived in Ann Arbor most of his
life. His aunt has a picture of him in the Big
House at age nine, back when the stadium was
furnished with wooden benches. For the past
30 years, he's spent football Saturdays as an
usher at Michigan Stadium.
"When I put on that equipment, I go there
like I'm supporting the football team," he said.
"We're a team. But my position on the team
is to make sure that the fans who come there
leave and say 'I had a nice time at Michigan
Stadium."'
For Tyler, the University is more than
a job. It may have started that way though,
back when his kids were little and he needed
the additional income. Tyler has kept his day
job - still gearing up with a lab coat each
day as a technician at a nearby research lab.
But Michigan is Tyler's community - it's the
place where he unwinds after a stressful day
at the lab, and the place where he takes his
responsibility to students seriously.
"Maybe it's a day where they were down
and not doing too well," Tyler said. "Maybe
it's a day when they didn't do well on an exam.
When they leave that station I want them to
feel good."
Still, when the line gets busy and the scents
of pizza, stir-fry or dining hall sugar cookies
waft over, students often develop tunnel vision
for the food, rushing toward the sandwich line
without much pause for the guy who lets them
into the dining hall.
"It's up to them because I'm always ready,"
Tyler said.
Susan Rollins: The work mom
StandinginoneofthehallwaysonMarkley's
fourth floor, custodian Susan Rollins twirls
a silver-colored necklace as she talks. The
pendant spells out "Mom" in cursive. Rollins'
fingers rotate around the letters.
When she started working at the

University 16 years ago, her own kids were
young. But now that two of them are in college,
she views students from the perspective of a
parent, not just as the custodian who cleans
their halls.
"When you look at it as these are people's
children, sometimes that interaction that we as
staff can have with them can make the biggest
difference," she said.
Picking up hallway trash, vacuuming,
cleaningrestrooms -that's the job. Butmaking
students feel at home, asking them how they're
doing, providing a friendly face during exam
period - that's the calling.
Though she never went away to college,
Rollins understands move-in day and the
excitement and nerves of the first month of
freshman year. She gets why parents cry when
they say goodbye. When Rollins dropped off
her daughter last year for the first time, she
cried too.
By making the effort to interact with
students, Rollins hopes she can spread the
same kind of comfort she would want staff in
her own daughter's residence hall to provide.
"Some people feel comfortable right away
making that connection and others don't,"
she said. "Sometimes you say good morning
and you get no response. It is a challenge
sometimes."
But Rollins, who said she is not naturally
outgoing, has worked hard to step out of
her comfort zone. For the past few years,
she's participated in a program that allows
employees to try out a new assignment during
the summer, where she has worked as a
facilities supervisor.
It's during the summer where she said she's
formed some of the best relationships with
students, especially the student residence hall
staff.
One move-in day, an RA from the previous
summer was helping her younger sister move
into Markley. Upon arrival, she went to find
Rollins and brought her to meet her family.
"Mom, this is my work mom," the girl said.
For Rollins, it's those moments that make
the hardest days bearable.
"Then you know you've made a difference
even if it was just those three months," Rollins
said. "To me it's so much more than work. If I
can make that connection for anyone else, for
the one or two semesters they're here - it's
worth it."
Voices of the staff
Tyler and Rollins are just two of the nearly
30,000 non-faculty staff members who set the
University's gears in motion.
The University's staff is a diverse group of
people. According to the 2013 human resources
annual report, the average staff member has
served for 11 years and is 44 years old. Seventy-
one percent are women and 20 percent are
members of a minority group. They work
in units ranging from plant operations and
finance to transportation, the hospital and the
Office of Admissions. operations and finance to
