Matthew Vlasic, one of 

four former fraternity mem-
bers charged in connec-

tion with damages inflicted 
on a Northern Michigan 
ski resort, was sentenced 
Monday to two years of pro-
bation, 100 hours of com-
munity service and a $5,000 
fine, according to Otsego 
County Prosecutor Michael 
Rola.

Senate Assembly 
straw poll shows 
support for more 
Friday lectures

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

Senate Assembly members 

voiced overwhelming support 
for a proposal floated last week 
to increase the number of 
classes scheduled on Fridays. 
The straw poll — which isn’t 
binding — was conducted at 
Monday’s meeting of the Senate 
Assembly.

Classical Studies Prof. David 

Potter, chair of the body’s 
Student 
Relations 
Advisory 

Committee, said the committee 
has discussed the possibility of 
increasing the number of Friday 
morning classes in response to 
excessive alcohol consumption 
among students.

“The number of lecture classes 

for first- and second-year classes 
that occur with a Friday section 

have declined significantly in 
the course of the last couple of 
years which has really led to a 
much more intensive culture of 
student drinking on what is now 
known as ‘thirsty Thursday,’ ” 
Potter said.

The issue was first raised at a 

Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs meeting last 
week, and was brought to the full 
Senate Assembly on Monday.

In an interview last week 

with 
The 
Michigan 
Daily, 

University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack said she supported the 
idea of having more classes 
on Fridays, and noted that 
schools and colleges are already 
encouraged to hold 15 percent 
of their classes on that day.

Specifically, the committee 

suggested 
the 
central 

administration mandate 100- 
and 200-level courses with 
10 sections or more have a 
required lecture on Friday.

Potter said while the decision 

to hold more Friday classes will 
not alleviate dangerous campus 
drinking entirely, it is a step in

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 

Arbor) 
introduced 
legislation 

Thursday that aims to legalize 
and tax the private use of 
marijuana for Michiganders who 
are 21 and older.

The Marijuana Legalization 

and Regulation Act — House 
Bill 
4877 
— 
would 
allow 

Michigan residents to grow a 
limited amount of marijuana 
plants in their own homes for 
their own consumption. Under 
the legislation, only licensed 
dispensaries would be able to sell 
marijuana to the public. Amounts 
of one ounce or less can be 
transferred between individuals 
if no payment is exchanged.

In an interview, Irwin said 

AAU data shows 
survivors of sexual 
assault unlikely to 

report crime

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

About 
30 
percent 
of 

undergraduate women at the 
University reported experiencing 
nonconsensual 
penetration 

or sexual touching by force 
or incapacitation during their 
time at the University, a new 
report released Monday found. 
Nationwide, the figure was 23.1 
percent.

Of University students who 

experienced 
nonconsensual 

penetration involving physical 
force, 76.8 percent of them did not 

report the crime. 

These findings come from 

a set of data released by the 
Association 
of 
American 

Universities, 
which 
surveyed 

28 top research universities, 
including the University.

Of all students who said they 

did not report their experience of 
sexual misconduct, 37.4 percent 
said it was because they didn’t 
think anything would be done 
about it. Of all students surveyed, 
40.2 percent indicated it was 
extremely or very likely that 
campus officials would conduct 
a fair investigation of a reported 
instance of sexual misconduct. 

Nationwide, 
11.7 
percent 

of surveyed college students 
experienced 
nonconsensual 

sexual contact as a result of force 
or incapacitation, according to 
the survey. The figure was 14.6 
percent at the University.

Nationally, 
50 
percent 
of 

students who experienced sexual 
misconduct said they did not 
report the incident because they 
didn’t consider it serious enough.

Of 
University 
students 

surveyed, 
30.3 
percent 
of 

undergraduate women at the 
University reported experiencing 
nonconsensual 
penetration 

or sexual touching by force or 
incapacitation during their time 
at the University. Nationwide, the 
figure was 23.1 percent.

Holly 
Rider-Milkovich, 

director 
the 
University’s 

Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness 
Center, 
said 
the 

survey data will help inform the 
University’s approach to sexual 
misconduct.

“With regard to some areas of 

nonconsensual sexual behavior, 
our numbers are higher than the 
aggregate data, while in other 
areas we are consistent with it,” 
she said. “But in all cases, the 

numbers are too high and we 
are committed to continuing 
to address the issue of sexual 
misconduct. The data from these 
surveys are critical to our work. 
The more we know about our 
community, the better we are able 
to tailor our programs to be most 
effective.”

The 
AAU 
survey 
results 

come several months after the 
University 
released 
its 
own 

sexual assault report in June. The 
University’s data showed 22.5 
percent of female students were 
sexually assaulted during their 
time at the school.

The AAU survey did point 

to 
consistencies 
with 
the 

University’s own survey results 
— namely that most instances 
of 
sexual 
assault 
occurred 

after 
verbal 
pressure, 
under 

the influence of drugs or when 
too drunk to stop what was

into an agreement with the 
University’s Board of Regents 
that 
requires 
the 
City 
to

Mcity. The city of Ann Arbor 
will contribute to the project 
by helping to sustain the test 
environment by maintaining 

existing equipment, providing 
network support and enhancing 
the facility as needed for 
additional research efforts.

The 
resolution 
approves 

Ann Arbor’s participation in a

he sponsored the bill because 
he sees giving adults the right 
to make their own decisions is 
consistent with American values.

“I think we need to let adults 

make their own choices about 
what they eat and what they put 
in their body,” he said.

Currently, it is only legal in 

Michigan to use marijuana for 
medical 
purposes 
authorized 

by 
a 
physician. 
In 
Ann 

Arbor, 
marijuana 
has 
been 

decriminalized 
since 
1972, 

meaning its use is still illegal but 
the only punishment for first-
time offenders is a $25 fine.

Statewide — including on 

University 
property, 
which 

doesn’t follow city ordinances — 
marijuana use and possession is 
a felony. 

Under the bill, the state 

would impose both Michigan’s 
6-percent sales tax as well as 
an additional 5-percent excise 
tax on the wholesale market for 
marijuana. The excise tax would 
increase by 1 percent each year, 
capping off at 10 percent after a 
five-year period.

The revenue from this excise 

tax — based on comparisons 
with 
Colorado, 
where 
the 

wholesale excise tax on non-
medicinal 
marijuana 
is 
15 

percent — would total roughly 
$100 million, according to a 
Michigan 
House 
Democrats 

press release.

Forty percent of the tax 

revenue 
would 
go 
toward 

early 
childhood 
education, 

another 40 percent would go 
toward Michigan roads and the 
remaining 20 percent would be 
used to fund substance-abuse 
treatment programs.

Irwin said he felt complete 

prohibition as a method for 
controlling 
marijuana 
use 

and distribution doesn’t work 
because it’s too costly to the 
taxpayers and individuals who 
are prosecuted.

“There’s both practical and 

philosophical 
motivations 

(to legalize marijuana) — the 
practical motivation is that 
prohibition is a colossal, costly 
failure: It doesn’t accomplish 
any of its goals, it promotes the 
black market, it puts money and 

power in the hands of criminals 
and it makes (marijuana) more 
available to young kids.”

He also noted that, based 

on examples of other states 
that have legalized marijuana, 
it is unlikely that doing so in 
Michigan would impact the 
amount of people under 21 who 
use the drug.

“The law has very little 

impact on what people choose 
to do,” he said. “If you look at 
what’s happening in Colorado, 
teen use is pretty much the 
same as what it was before 
legalization.”

However, 
marijuana 

legalization bills across the 
country have drawn opposition 
from some health professionals.

Carl Karoub, a physician who 

practices in Royal Oak, said he 
legalizing marijuana is not a 
smart decision.

He noted the state has an 

incredibly high incidence of 
depression, 
and 
legalizing 

a drug such as marijuana, 
which can be used to increase 
endorphins, in a place ripe 
for substance abuse could be 
dangerous.

Karoub said while he doesn’t 

turn to it as his first option, he 
is not inherently opposed to the 
use of medical marijuana for 
certain patients who are, for 
example, experiencing chronic 
pain and for whom conventional 
treatments would not succeed.

He cautioned, though, that 

marijuana makes people less 
productive, and that the effects 
of using it last for extended 
periods after the fact.

“Marijuana 
has 
certain 

psychiatric and psychological 
effects that may not end when 
you stop using marijuana. They 
may be persistent for days, for 
months, and sometimes they 
stay for a lifetime if you used it 
chronically. If you smoke it, you 
run the risks of heart disease, 
high cholesterol, heart attack 
and loss of brain cells,” he said.

Irwin 
said 
he 
thinks 

marijuana should be regulated 
similarly 
to 
how 
alcohol 

consumption is regulated in the 
United States because the health 
risks associated with marijuana 
are no more harmful than those 
associated with alcohol.

“This idea that we have 

legally available alcohol, which 

is 
addictive 
and 
incredibly 

intoxicating — and can kill 
you — yet we strongly punish 
people who possess and use 
marijuana, despite the fact that 
it’s non-toxic, it’s not physically 
addictive and you can’t overdose 
on it,” he said. “That’s always 
struck me as silly.”

There 
are 
also 
several 

organizations currently working 
to legalize marijuana in the state 
through ballot initiative.

If a legalization petition 

receives 250,000 signatures of 
Michigan voters, the legislature 
has 40 days to adopt or reject 
the proposal. If they reject it, 
the proposed legislature would 
then go before the electorate 
for approval on the 2016 ballot.

Irwin said there are many 

legislators 
who 
support 

the 
principles 
behind 
his 

legislation, but that for political 
reasons, they may be reluctant 
to jump on board. As a result, he 
said it is marginally more likely 
that the issue will be decided 
through ballot initiative than 
in the legislature.

Third-year 
law 
student 

Reid Murdoch, the executive 
director of Law Students for 
Sensible Drug Policy, echoed 
Irwin’s sentiment, saying the 
several ballot initiatives are the 
real story in the legalization 
debate.

However, he said Irwin’s bill 

could potentially add momentum 
to the debate in Michigan.

“Even if there was political 

will in the legislature to pass 
it, it’s probably not going to be 
a priority,” he said. “The bill 
being out there — it’s a talking 
point, it’s a way for people to 
see it and it’s a way for those 
who might be more on the fence 
to understand that it’s going to 
the legislature as well.”

Murdoch 
said 
some 
of 

the students involved with 
his organization on campus 
volunteer 
with 
the 
ballot 

initiative MI Legalize to help 
collect signatures, and added 
his organization has worked 
with Irwin in the past.

“This legislation signals that 

we are trying to treat our young 
people with more dignity,” he 
said. “A drug conviction can 
keep you out of all sorts of 
professions.”

freshmen students words of 
advice.

“If you are coming from 

a different culture, try to 
meet people. People here 
are very nice; don’t be 
afraid to talk to people. 
Even if you are an intro-
vert, it’s OK. People will 
come and talk to you, so I 
think it is very easy for you 
to open up. If international 
students are worried about 
fitting into this culture, 
just be yourself and peo-
ple here will accept you.” 
—Dilparinder Singh, first-
year MBA student in the 
Ross School of Business

“Do not be scared to put 

yourself out there even if 
you have to end up doing 
things by yourself — you 
end up meeting so many 
awesome different people 
from various paths of life. 
It’s really cool to see the 
different types of people 
who go here that are unit-
ed by the common goal to 
be leaders and best.” 

—Nursing 
sophomore 

Alexis Valenciano

“Don’t get overwhelmed 

by the raised standards of 
being an upperclassman. 
Take it easy, and don’t

36 generations 
of rats later, ‘U’ 

researchers connect 
inactivy and illness

By SANJAY REDDY

Daiily Staff Reporter

Physicians have long recog-

nized the health benefits of reg-
ular exercise. Now, University 
researchers are getting closer to 
explaining the ways in which 
exercise helps reduce susceptibil-
ity to disease.

Steve Britton, a professor of 

anesthesiology, and Lauren Koch, 
an associate professor of anes-
thesiology, have long bred rats to 
model how exercise affects the 
risk for developing certain dis-
eases in humans.

“We believed that there was a 

strong relationship between how 
long one was going to live and how 
large their exercise capacity was,” 
Britton said. “It seemed that those 
who had a large exercise capacity 
were living healthier and longer.”

To test the theory, University 

researchers in 1996 developed a 
selective breeding process to gen-
erate rats that were either “high 
capacity runners” or “low capac-
ity runners.” To do this, Koch said 
they took a large sample of rats 
and measured their endurance 
on treadmills. The rats that could 
run for longer periods of time 
were then bred together.

“We believed that if we had 

lab rats that we could selectively 
breed on low or high exercise 
capacity, then we could develop 
a model system to see how low 
capacity and high capacity rats 
harbor complex disease risks and 
health risks,” Koch said. “So it 

was a good way to look at health 
and disease genetically.”

Since the beginning of the 

breeding process more than 20 
years ago, Britton and Koch have 
bred 36 generations of rats. Now, 
years of breeding are beginning 
to pay off — allowing researchers 
across the country to use these 
selectively bred lineages of rats to 
conduct their own studies. Brit-
ton said their model is the only 
one to allow for direct artificial 
selection for exercise capacity. He 
added that the rat model has been 
studied at 60 institutions nation-
wide, and has been the subject of 
about 100 papers in scientific lit-
erature.

Results from the rat model 

studies have confirmed research-
ers’ theory that exercise stimu-
lates health and life expectancy, 
Britton said. The rats bred with 
a high exercise capacity have 
been shown to be more resistant 
to memory loss, sleep disorders, 
obesity and fatty liver disease 
compared to those bred with a 
low exercise capacity. In addition, 
their average life expectancies 
are between 28 and 45 percent 
higher.

Koch said these results are a 

step toward figuring out exactly 
how exercise benefits the human 
body.

“We know that exercise is good 

for you,” Koch said. “But we don’t 
know the underlying mechanisms 
behind it. This model is helping us 
uncover some of the connections 
between both exercise and health 
and inactivity and disease.”

Britton cited his collaboration 

with colleagues at Colorado State 
University as an exciting avenue 
for future studies. Researchers 
at CSU are testing the effects of 
exercise capacity on susceptibil-
ity to breast cancer, and their

of the Sigma Alpha Mu frater-
nity and a University alum, 
plead guilty in July to malicious 
destruction of property totaling 
more than $200, but less than 
$1,000. He was initially charged 
with a more serious, felony 
malicious destruction of prop-
erty charge, but the judge later 
reduced the charge to a misde-
meanor.

Vlasic is prohibited from 

using drugs and alcohol while 

on probation, and is subject to 
random testing.

Vlasic was one of 270 SAM 

fraternity and Sigma Delta Tau 
sorority members from the 
University who attended the 
January ski trip at the Tree-
tops Resort in Gaylord. Chap-
ter members reportedly caused 
more than $400,000 in dam-
ages during their stay.

Business 
juniors 
Joshua 

Kaplan and Zachary Levin, 
former president and treasurer 
of the disbanded fraternity, 
respectively, are scheduled to 
appear in court Thursday to 

file a plea agreement. Univer-
sity alum Jesse Krumholz, the 
fourth SAM member to receive 
criminal charges, plead guilty 
to malicious destruction of 
property less than $200 in July. 
He will be sentenced October 5.

In March, the national SAM 

organization 
disbanded 
the 

University’s chapter, citing the 
failure of its members to fully

Amendments to snow removal 

policy approved

Council 
also 
approved 
an 

amendment to sections of the 
city’s snow removal policy — a 
change recommended by the 
recently-released 
Pedestrian 

Safety and Access Task Force.

The ordinance amended three 

sections in the Code of the City 
of Ann Arbor and added a fourth 
amendment regarding sidewalk 
snow removal policies.

One of the amendments asks 

alters language in the section that 
calls for the removal of snow greater 
than one inch, so that residents 
are now required to remove any 
snowfall that lands on the sidewalks 
outside of their property.

A second amendment states 

that residents will have 24 hours 
to clear their sidewalks, after 
which they will receive a citation 
from 
Community 
Standards. 

From the time they receive the 
citation, they will then have 
another 24 hours to clear their 

property themselves before the 
City does it for them and issues 
the resident a fee for doing so.

The third amendment clarifies 

that the fine for the citation and 
the fee for the City clearing the 
resident’s 
sidewalks 
are 
two 

separate fees.

Councilmember 
Stephen 

Kunselman (D–Ward 3) said he is 
pro-“clear pavement,” but he said 
the ordinance presents too abrupt 
of a change.

“I would like to define ways 

of getting to a lower threshold 
of snow, in a way that is gradual 
and takes into account other 
things like fines and really going 
after the chronic offenders in a 
way that doesn’t feel so abrupt 
for the rest of the community,” 
Kunselman said.

Vote 
on 
zoning 
change 

postponed

During Monday’s meeting, an 

ordinance to amend a zoning law 
pertaining to a new apartment 
complex was postponed until 
the Council’s second meeting in 
November. The amendment, if 
passed, will re-zone what is now 
53.61 acres, located off of Nixon 
Road and M-14, of agriculture 
and wetlands to make way for 
development of a new complex, 
the Woodbury Club Apartments.

The apartment complex would 

consist of 282 apartment units 
and 575 parking spaces.

Many community members 

who live in the area, which is now 

composed mostly of wetlands, 
spoke out against the development 
project.

Among those concerned were 

residents who live near Barclay 
Park, an area that borders the 
prospective development site.

“I speak for the board and the 

membership when I say we are 
opposed to any new development 
north and west of Barclay Park,” 
said William Quinn, Barclay Park 
Board of Directors president. “We 
are very concerned about the 
impact the development will have 
on the wetlands and traffic.”

Several councilmembers also 

expressed concerns.

Councilmember Jane Lumm 

(I–Ward 2) said if the Council 
voted to postpone their vote on 
the bill, it could use that time to try 
to solve some of the community’s 
concerns with the project.

“This time can be used to work 

through all of the issues, get 
more clarity, definition and get 
in concert with the neighbors,” 
Lumm said.

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) echoed 
Lumm’s opinion.

“I would like to see a move 

from a perspective of mitigation 
to 
actually 
preservation,” 

Kailasapathy said. “The whole 
lens through which we now see 
things is ‘Okay, let’s destroy some 
trees and then let’s plant some 
other trees over there.’ I think Ann 
Arbor can do better than that.”

the right direction.

“We’re 
not 
talking 
about 

something that is going to 
change the entire culture of the 
University overnight, nor are 
we suggesting that the majority 
of our students aren’t extremely 
serious,” he said. “What we are 
suggesting is that there has been 
an upsurge in alcohol-related 
issues and that if Friday becomes 
a regular school day … the issue 
of drinking will decline.”

SACUA 
chair 
Silke-

Maria 
Weineck, 
professor 

of 
comparative 
literature, 

said University officials have 
expressed 
support 
for 
the 

proposal, but would prefer the 
initiative be driven by faculty, not 
the central administration.

“The 
administration 
has 

signaled to us that they would be 
very open to such a suggestion 
coming from the faculty, but 
they don’t want to be the ones 
introducing it because it would, 
of course, require that quite a few 
of us actually show up on Friday 
to teach classes,” Weineck said.

Weineck 
also 
proposed 

offering some sort of incentives 
for 
departments 
willing 
to 

have more classes on Fridays, 
especially 
those 
with 
large 

introductory courses.

“We haven’t discussed this 

in any detail but maybe the 
University could offer some 
incentives 
for 
departments 

willing to do that,” she said. “If 
you have the Econ 101 and Psych 
101 as a required lecture on 
Friday morning, you take out a 
lot of drinking.”

Senate 
Assembly 
discusses 

release of student data

The issue of whether or not to 

publicly release student course 
evaluations 
also 
generated 

debate among members of the 
Senate Assembly.

Biology Prof. John Lehman, 

a SACUA member, said that 
last 
November, 
Pollack, 
the 

University provost, asked the 
University’s Academic Affairs 
Advisory Committee to consider 
the 
release 
of 
numerical 

responses in student course 
evaluations to the following 
four prompts: overall this is an 
excellent course, overall the 
instructor 
was 
an 
excellent 

teacher, I learned a great deal 
from this course and I had a 
strong desire to take this course.

Lehman said he presented the 

proposal to the Senate Assembly 
and conducted a straw poll 

among members of the assembly 
that same month. Among those 
who responded — which was 
about half of the assembly — 
close to 60 percent supported 
releasing the scores.

In their April meeting, Lehman 

said, AAAC members discussed 
creating alternatives to two of the 
four prompts — overall this was 
an excellent course and overall 
the instructor was an excellent 
teacher — because of concerns that 
they were based on popularity, not 
student-learning objectives.

According to Lehman, Pollack 

said she would ask the Center 
on Research for Learning and 
Teaching 
to 
formulate 
new 

questions. However, Lehman said 
as of SACUA’s Sept. 11 meeting 
with Pollack, those questions 
hadn’t been generated yet.

Lehman 
said 
student 

representatives at the AAAC 
meeting said they want the 
evaluations made public to help 
answer questions such as which 
professor they should select for 
courses taught by multiple people 
and the difficulty of the course.

“We need to take notice of 

the fact that student faculty 
governance 
has 
unanimously 

called for the release of this 
information, they’ve transmitted 
all of this to the provost and 

met with the provost,” Lehman 
said. “It certainly seems to me 
speaking with her that she’s 
receptive to this.”

Weineck, the SACUA chair, 

presented several caveats to 
releasing course evaluations to 
the assembly, such as that faculty 
might teach to the evaluation, 
the evaluations might hurt junior 
faculty seeking tenure, race and 
ethnicity courses tend to score 
lower in evaluations because the 
course content is uncomfortable 
and data shows students treat 
female faculty and faculty of 
color differently in evaluations.

Comparative Literature Prof. 

Catherine Brown said reworking 
the course evaluations so that 
students actually care about the 
results could boost response 
rates and make the evaluations a 
better student tool.

“The percentage of people 

that respond to the evaluations is 
tremendously low,” she said. “So 
my concern would be that folks 
would be making their decisions 
based on extraordinarily low 
response rates.”

In a straw poll, the assembly 

voted to bring the issue of 
releasing student evaluations to 
the faculty as a whole during the 
next Senate Assembly meeting on 
October 19. 

happening.

With the new and sweeping set 

of data, University administrators 
will now be able to both gauge the 
accuracy of its own campus sexual 
assault survey results and assess 
how the University’s findings 
compare 
to 
peer 
institutions 

nationwide.

According 
to 
a 
University 

release, 6,700 University students 
participated in the AAU survey, 
making for a 17.6-percent response 
rate. The national response rate 
was 19.3 percent.

The AAU survey also pointed to 

high numbers of sexual harassment 
among students. Nationally, 61.9 
percent of female undergraduates 
reported being sexually harassed. 
At the University specifically, 
54.7 percent of students reported 
having 
experienced 
sexual 

harassment 
since 
entering 

college, and 73.2 percent of female 
undergraduate students reported 
instances of sexual harassment.

The AAU survey found 60.4 

percent of gay and lesbian students 
report being sexually harassed, 
compared to 45.9 percent of 
heterosexual students.

The AAU survey also reported 

that transgender, genderqueer, 
non-conforming or questioning 
students had the highest rates of 
sexual assault.

The national data also reveals 

a general hesitance to report 
instances of sexual misconduct, 
with some variance based upon 
the severity of misconduct.

Nationwide, 
the 
highest 

reporting rates occurred when a 
subject was stalked (28 percent) or 
physically forced into penetration 
(25.5 percent), but drop to 5 
percent if the subject was sexually 
touched while incapacitated.

Additionally, 
35.9 
percent 

of 
students 
who 
experienced 

sexual misconduct did not report 
because they were “embarrassed,” 
“ashamed” — or because doing 
so “would be too emotionally 
difficult.” One-third of students said 
they did not report because they did 
not think anything would be done.

In a conference call with 

reporters, AAU President Hunter 

Rawlings said he hopes the 
participating universities will use 
the survey data to the benefit of 
their students.

“The purpose of this survey is 

to enhance the safety of students 
on our campuses,” he said. “It is 
our hope that these universities 
and others will be able to make 
use of these data on behalf of their 
students.”

The 
AAU 
survey’s 
large 

sample size, in both universities 
studied and number of student 
respondents, makes it unique 
among similar surveys conducted 
on campus climate.

With a national response rate 

of 19.3 percent, Bonnie Fisher, 
professor at the University of 
Cincinnati’s College of Education 
Criminal Justice and Human 
Services and developer of the 
survey, said the relatively large 
sample size allows analysts to get 
a more accurate picture of campus 
climate.

“This is a strength because it 

allows for a greater estimation 
of the prevalence of different 
forms of sexual assault and sexual 
misconduct on each campus,” 
Fisher said in a conference call 
with reporters.

Some 
data 
points, 
including 

whether students would report and 
how students believed the University 
would respond to a reported assault, 
varied by up to 25 percentage points 
among college campuses. According 
to David Cantor, who is vice president 
of Westat, the research firm that 
conducted the survey, factors such 
as size and whether the institution is 
public or private only provide a weak 
correlation to explain the variance.

“It is important to slice and 

dice these events very carefully 
and that is one of the strengths 
of the survey,” Cantor said in the 
conference call.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel has identified sexual 
assault on campus as a top 
priority for his administration. 
The 
University’s 
response 
to 

allegations of sexual misconduct 
is currently under investigation by 
the U.S. Department of Education. 
Earlier this month, Schlissel told 
The Michigan Daily that he hopes 
to update the University’s Student 
Sexual Misconduct Policy before 
the new year.

Nursing junior Alex Fauer,

“The first stage of change that

U

nfortunately, insensitivity 
is commonplace without 
exposure to individuals 

with intellectual disabilities. When 
I ask my 
mom 
wheth-
er 
she 

knew my oldest sister, Selina, had 
Down’s Syndrome before she was 
born, she always responds, “Thank 
god I didn’t.” Even she admits to 
not having challenged stigmas 
until she raised her first child. I, 
on the other hand, have grown up 
with a disabled older sister, mak-
ing me very aware of others’ use of 
vocabulary pertaining to individu-
als like Selina. The use of the word 
“retarded” has changed quite a bit 
in the last century, from a technical 
to a derogatory term, and I have a 
problem with how it’s used today. 

It was originally accepted as the 

way of referring to people with 
mental disabilities, but has since 
come to be loaded with a very dif-
ferent connotation. My whole life, 
I’ve heard it used as an insult. 
Whether used self-deprecatingly 
(“I can’t believe I said that. I sound 
so retarded!”) or a fun jape between 
friends (“Dude, you looked like a 
retard!”), for some reason the use 
of this word has yet to be curbed. 
Unlike problematic terms referring 
to other minorities, such as “fag-
got,” I don’t see much backlash to 
the use of “retard” or “retarded” at 
the University of Michigan.

Usually, if I hear someone use a 

slur against the LGBTQ commu-
nity, which is already rare, they are 
called out pretty quickly. Despite 

my friends and students at the Uni-
versity being relatively forward 
with social justice, for some reason, 
slurs against intellectually disabled 
individuals aren’t kept in check 
quite as much. Could it be because 
many like my sister don’t have the 
option of attending college, and 
therefore aren’t worth changing 
campus 
culture 

for?

But then again, 

it’s not as if I do a 
lot for the cause, 
either. Just last 
night I was hang-
ing 
out 
with 

some friends and 
repeatedly heard 
the word used, 
but said nothing. 
Why do I value 
the comfort and 
peace of a social situation over the 
dignity and respect of individuals 
with intellectual disabilities? I have 
sometimes in the past called people 
out for using the word, and I always 
got one of three responses.

The first option is that the person 

recognizes their mistake almost 
immediately and apologizes, and I 
can tell that they sincerely regret 
using it. The second response is 
that the person who I called out 
remembers that I have an intellec-
tually disabled sibling, and I can 
tell in their eyes how uncomfort-
able they are. They’ll apologize, 
but I can tell that it is a hurried 
and awkward apology, done for my 
sake rather than out of a desire 
to use less offensive vocabulary. 
The third response I’ve gotten 

is something along the lines of 
“I don’t actually mean retarded 
‘retarded!’ That’s not even the 
word they use for disabled peo-
ple. Stop being so sensitive.” 

While it is true “an individual 

with an intellectual disability” has 
replaced “mentally retarded individ-
ual,” using this slur will always draw 

upon connota-
tions of people 
like my sister. 
And every time 
I hear it, I will 
think back to 
elementary 
school, 
when 

other students 
actually would 
directly bully 
the kids who 
had legitimate 
developmental 

disabilities.

It’s not as if hearing the word 

makes me never want to hang out 
with those who use it. Part of my 
frustration is just knowing how 
jealous Selina is of the fact that I 
get to attend college and be sur-
rounded by so many friends. It kills 
me that my friends — the types of 
people who she would love to also 
be friends with — use a word so 
negatively charged with such a 
casual lack of self-awareness. My 
sister is extremely sensitive to the 
respect and feelings of others. I can 
only hope those who use the word 
“retarded” might choose to be a bit 
more like her.

“That’s retarded”

Defending trigger warnings
W

hen you live in an apartment 
occupied 
solely 
by 
English 

majors, some interesting revela-

tions are bound to arise. 
The first thing you’d prob-
ably notice is the ever-
present opportunity for 
generic living-room chats 
to morph into moments 
of 
thought-provoking 

literary 
discussion 
and 

analysis. You unintention-
ally begin to acquire full 
synopses and major plot 
points for books you’re not 
even reading, and discus-
sion questions for classes 
you’re not even in. Many of my evenings this 
past week involved one of my roommates — 
as we sat doing homework — recanting grisly 
tales of bloodshed and violence from “The 
Iliad” while I brought up themes of sexual-
ity and societal pressures within “Giovanni’s 
Room.”

These discussions led me to the realization 

that English majors — along with a multitude 
of students immersed in humanities courses 
— read, examine and analyze some of the 
most controversial topics out there. Sexual-
ity, gender, race, discrimination, violence, 
inequality, injustice, tragedy, oppression and 
morality — more often than not — comprise 
the bulk of our subject matter. While these 
are crucial intellectual matters to discuss, for 
individuals who personally experienced cer-
tain forms of trauma, such as sexual assault, 
they may experience some difficulty as they 
initially engage with them.

Therefore, I was surprised to learn Com-

mittee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure of 
the American Association of University Pro-
fessors, earlier this month, described “trigger 
warnings” as a “current threat to academic 
freedom” and stated the group’s opposition to 
the practice of issuing them to students. 

While Committee A argues against “trig-

ger warnings” (in particular, mandated ones), 
its statement does make a clear distinction 
between “academic regulation” and “faculty 
judgment.” The report acknowledges the 
possibility of scenarios emerging where an 
instructor may find it necessary to fore-
warn students about concerning material, 
and it asserts the instructor’s personal 
right to do so.

However, merely mentioning the phrase 

“trigger warning” in the last few months has 
prompted an outpouring of critiques stigma-
tizing the phrase. Accompanied by this debate 
is a myriad of accusations that today’s college 
population is a mass of individuals who are 
“coddled,” “over-sensitive” and politically 

correct to a concerning degree. A recurring 
argument in the vast amount of commentary 
is that these warnings don’t exist in the real 
world, so providing them to students in their 
courses leaves them unprepared to handle 
similar issues once their college careers end.

Yet, warnings in the media aren’t a novel 

concept. Various media, for years, have been 
categorized according to a system of ratings 
to provide viewers with information about 
the content they’re consuming. Songs are fre-
quently marked as explicit. Labeling on video 
games warns of questionable content. Grant-
ed, these ratings were originally instituted 
and primarily serve as safeguards for younger 
audiences. Yet even content that undisputed-
ly is mainly intended for adult audiences still 
retains these warnings. If you go to an R-rat-
ed movie, the film’s rating is still justified by 
a list of the potentially controversial images 
and themes that adult viewers (including 
those only a year away from legal adulthood) 
can expect to encounter. Television shows, 
such as “American Horror Story,” for exam-
ple, feature warnings advising “viewer dis-
cretion” before the opening credits and still 
depict horrific imagery, unsettling themes 
and gruesome scenes of violence.

Sometimes, “trigger warnings” happen 

naturally, whether we use that particular 
term or not. A few days ago, as a friend mes-
saged me about a newly released music video, 
he mentioned beforehand that there might be 
some potential content issues. Immediately 
after sending me a link to an article about the 
video, he followed up by saying it was difficult 
to watch but told me it was something that 
needed to be shared.

Students — regardless of any particular 

concentration — encounter challenging and 
discomforting topics in their studies. They 
personally experience and understand the 
reality of the complex and distressing issues 
that permeate our society. Rather than shy 
away from these issues, students often seek 
out discussions about racism, classism, sex-
ism and injustice on their own in order to 
prepare to work to remedy them.

Advocating for a brief overview of poten-

tially troubling content doesn’t equate to 
asking for an excuse to completely avoid 
potentially jarring material or texts one 
may not fully agree with. As students ask for 
information about particularly disturbing 
material beforehand, it’s a respectful request 
for the acknowledgement that not every stu-
dent’s experiences are similar, and to avoid 
the assumption that every individual in a 
classroom will react the same way. The stig-
ma that views these warnings as an extreme 
byproduct of an overly politically correct 
environment exaggerates their intent.

At the most basic level, “trigger warnings,” 

whether you choose to label them as such or 
not, are intended as preventative measures 
and simple warnings. For those affected by 
particular emotional traumas, this foresight 
isn’t meant to inhibit discussion. Rather, it 
allows students to prepare themselves and 
acknowledge any potential personal issues 
while they still continue to try and engage 
with the material, but in a different manner.

Why the family dog matters

I 

didn’t get poison ivy this 
summer. I usually get it from 
my back yard, which is a 

wooded 
lot 
in 

Illinois. Instead, 
while I was away 
in New York for 
an internship, my 
dog died and I picked up a violent 
variety of Manhattan crabs. There’s 
a coming-of-age anecdote there, if 
you look too closely.

I’m joking, of course — about the 

crabs, at least. My dog really did die. 
But the parents are fine — better 
than I thought they’d be since my 
dog collapsed at the dinner table. 
It’s pretty much just them in the 
house now — you know the gears of 
age are turning when you start wor-
rying about your parents, and not 
vice versa. 

But I guess they’ve been dealing 

with the death of the dog longer than 
I have. They called me right after 
he collapsed and, yeah, I cried. But 
it really doesn’t hit you until you’re 
back in the old house and realize 
how quiet it is. Or you see the spot 
where the dog’s bowl used to be.

This isn’t an obituary for a dead 

pet, I promise. But it is a story 
about why the death of a family dog 
really matters.

I was in Washington Square, near 

New York University, when my mom 
called — the dog had a tumor around 
his heart. There’s no feeling quite 
like hearing your mother cry — it 
sticks you in the gut and stays there. 
I hung up quickly. I didn’t want her 
to hear my voice cracking.

Crying is fine in Washington 

Square, though; about a quarter of 
Manhattan’s crazies gather there 
daily. There was one lady chewing 
on her hand, and another man with 
a dead parrot on a leash, and me, a 
hirsute 21-year-old in hysterics over 
a golden retriever.

I know why I reacted that way, 

and it wasn’t just about losing a dog.

We bought the dog when I was 13. 

Mom put the kids in the pickup truck 
and drove out to McHenry, out in the 
country, to a farmer whose golden 
retriever just had a litter. I was going 
into eighth grade and it was the sum-
mer my cousin, Allie, came to stay.

Allie’s home life back in Boston 

wasn’t ideal, so for the summer she 
lived with us in Illinois. It seems sad 
now, but back then it was magical: 
We had the pickup truck, my older 
sister had just gotten her driver’s 
license, and every night that sum-
mer we could make it to McDonald’s 
before it closed and get ice cream 
for a dollar, which we’d eat in the 
truck bed while we looked out over 
the lake.

But suddenly 

it was already 
August. Eighth 
grade 
loomed 

just around the 
corner, and the 
light at the end 
of the tunnel 
was the puppy. 
He ran with 
us around the 
lake, he slept with us in the bed of 
the pickup.

And then, suddenly, I was 21 and 

in New York. Eight more summers 
had turned to fall and then winter 
without me even noticing.

And then the dog was dead. A 

tumor on his big, stupid heart. And it 
seemed that summer was dead. The 
weather was hot, but all it did was 
make my suit sticky. After gradua-
tion, there would never be another 
summer of freedom. But with the 
dog’s death, that summer before 
eighth grade came back. I smelled 
the tobacco smoke stuck to the 
truck’s interior. I saw the progres-
sion of constellations. I heard Allie 
crying on summer nights.

Washington Square was getting 

dark. I started walking to my apart-
ment, but then kept walking. About 
10, I reached Central Park, about 
50 blocks north of my place. I don’t 
remember getting home. But the 
next morning, Thursday, I got a call 
from my cousin Allie. She would be in 
New York for about an hour the next 
day, en route to her home in Boston. 
Things with her parents had turned 
for the better years ago, so after she 
left that summer I rarely saw her. 
The call seemed like providence.

We planned to meet at some food 

festival in Midtown, before she 
hopped on the train at Grand Cen-
tral. If I sprinted to the subway on 
my lunch break, I could catch her.

At about noon I snuck out of the 

office and loosened my tie. I was 
already sweating through my shirt 
when I got to the subway platform. 
I sweated even more when the train 
broke down somewhere between 
Union Square and Grand Central. 
And then, after a half-hour of wait-
ing, I finally emerged from the sub-
way. Allie’s text came through: She 

couldn’t 
get 
a 

hold of me and 
had 
caught 
an 

earlier train. Off 
to Boston.

It was about 

12:45 p.m. I had 
to be back to work 
sometime in the 
next half hour, 
but I sat down at 
the food festival 

and had something to eat. I loved 
New York — the culture and cuisine 
were palliatives for loneliness and a 
low paycheck.

But here I was, crying into an arti-

sanal, gluten-free pork-belly kimchi 
taco. Was this worth it? Being half a 
world away from home? Did I aban-
don my aging parents in an empty 
house for jazz concerts and fusion 
street food?

It’s not just about the dog. It boils 

down to this: Time moving for-
ward can be a lot to handle, some-
times, and that’s OK. Each year 
feels shorter than the last. We lose 
people. Whole patches of our lives 
can only be remembered through 
the people we spent that part of our 
lives with. Like Allie, and in a way, 
like the dog. It feels like when we 
lose them, we lose a whole chunk 
of ourselves. But this doesn’t have 
to be true.

I wound up getting poison ivy, by 

the way, on some cliffs outside Bos-
ton, visiting Allie. I left New York a 
little early and made a trip of it. We 
had 99-cent ice cream — with beer, 
now — by moonlight on the cliffs. 
Then, a week later, I flew home, 
to my parents’ house. I faced the 
place where the dog’s bowl used to 
be. And I paid attention to the way 
things are today.

The stigma that views these

EVENT PREVIEW
Professor discusses 
intersectionality

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writer

Intersectionality is ubiquitous 

in 
contemporary 
women’s 

studies. However, its entry into 
discourse 
has 

a 
complicated 

history. 
This 

concept 
has 

roots in a rich 
history 
of 

Black 
feminist 

thought 
and 

practice 
that 

was 
formally 

articulated, but 
not 
originally 

developed, 
by 

legal scholar and critical race 
theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw in 
her 1989 paper “Demarginalizing 
the Intersection of Race and 
Sex: A Black Feminist Critique 
of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, 
Feminist Theory and Antiracist 
Politics.”

The idea that people inhabit 

multiple 
social 
positions 

and 
identities 
(race, 
class, 

gender, 
nationality, 
sexuality, 

religion) 
that 
mutually 
and 

simultaneouslyaffect each other 
is one in U.S. Black feminist 
thought 
that 
long 
predates 

Crenshaw’s work in a specifically 
legal context. A central category 
for much of women’s studies 
scholarship, it is an analytical tool 
used now in many disciplines that 
seeks to describe the interaction 
of 
multiple 
oppression, 

discrimination and exploitation 
that affect people who occupy 
multiple identities.

For Jennifer C. Nash, professor 

of American Studies and Chair of 
the Women’s Studies Department 
at George Washington University, 
intersectionality emerged as a 
kind of “outsider knowledge.”

“By ‘outsider knowledge,’ I’m 

trying to think about the ways that 
intersectionality emerged from 
women of color who were trying 
to describe a particular set of 
experiences, some of which were 

being excluded from the legal 
system or having experiences of 
discrimination rendered invisible 
by law, some of which were being 
rendered invisible by feminist 
theory,” Nash said in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily.

However, 
intersectionality 

has begun to appear into the 
language repertoire of university 
administrations in the past 20 
years in ways that largely conflate 
it with diversity and minority 
enrollment. Nash devotes a great 
deal of energy in her career to 
describing and intervening in 
the place of Black feminism in 
the corporate university system, 
women’s 
studies 
departments 

and other disciplines. Her talk on 
Thursday, Sept. 24, will focus on 
how intersectionality has become 
institutionalized in the language 
of women’s studies departments 
and university administration 
that largely conflate it with 
inclusion, 
diversity 
and 

difference.

“My own interest in how 

intersectionality has been taken 
up, 
particularly 
in 
women’s 

studies as a field and discipline, 
is the way that intersectionality 
gets collapsed into diversity, 
particularly 
at 
universities,” 

Nash said. “So I’m interested in 
the way that, in women’s studies, 
it becomes almost a requirement 
that we describe our work and 
our teaching as intersectional.”

Intersectionality 
“gets 

deployed by universities (and 
women’s studies departments),” 
Nash 
wrote 
in 
the 
event 

description online, “to signal 
commitments to inclusion and 
difference.” She describes in 
her forthcoming book “Black 
Feminism Remixed” how Black 
women, through the language of 
intersectionality, are referenced 
only as “metaphor” in many 
academic settings.

“One of the things that is really 

interesting to me is how Black 
feminism, Black women and 
intersectionality get collapsed 

into each other,” Nash said. 
“So what I’m doing in the long 
article (“Practicing Love: Black 
Feminism, 
Love-Politics, 
and 

Post-Intersectionality”) is trying 
to say, in part, Black feminists 
have this very long intellectual 
tradition 
that’s 
varied, 
and 

complex, and multiple, and in the 
last five to 10 years we’ve come to 
assume that what Black women 
produce is intersectional work, 
and that’s it.”

In her work, Nash opposes the 

reductive, identitarian version 
of intersectionality that you see 
in universities with a “politics 
of love” that she sees as critical 
in the history of Black feminist 
intellectual 
history. 
Nash’s 

talk will work to reorient other 
intellectual histories that now 
celebrate certain political forms, 
like a politics of love, that Black 
feminism laid the basis for in the 
1970s.

Nash’s 
talk 
will 
be 
very 

important for many campus 
political 
and 
academic 

actors 
because 
it 
seeks 
to 

critique 
a 
vocabulary 
like 

“intersectionality” 
that 
so 

many take for granted. Such a 
critique is significant because 
it attempts to draw attention 
to how universities continually 
exclude certain Black women 
in spite of celebrating diversity 
and 
inclusion 
through 

intersectionality.

“What I’ve tried to develop is 

this idea that women’s studies 
has been obsessed with the 
figure or the metaphor of the 
Black woman and making Black 
women into metaphor or symbol, 
that is, Black women as never 
dealt with as a fleshy, material 
body,” 
Nash 
said. 
“When 

intersectionality 
moves 
into 

university discourses through 
the language of diversity, Black 
woman continues to operate 
as a symbol, whether it’s Black 
woman as the symbol of the most 
marginalized subject, or Black 
woman as the limits of agency.”

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Beyoncé is back. No she hasn’t 

released any new music quite yet 
(save one feature that dropped last 
week), but she is back, and it’s clear 
that this is a new era for Queen Bey.

I’m one of the few people who has 

a Tidal subscription, so without hav-
ing to make the trip to Philly and miss 
Welcome Week, I was lucky enough 
to watch Bey’s Made In America fes-
tival set from the comfort of my own 
bed. That’s when I realized it: This 
isn’t the same Beyoncé I saw last 
summer on the On The Run Tour. 
This isn’t the same Beyoncé who 
dropped a surprise album in Decem-

ber 2013. Yes, that Bey and this one 
are eerily similar, but this one has a 
few new tricks for her loyal fans.

For starters, anyone who has 

seen all of Beyoncé’s tours/DVDs 
knows that she keeps up fan favor-
ites throughout her shows. She’s 
been daunting the same intro to “Get 
Me Bodied” for years now and same 
for her go-to finale “Halo.” But now, 
her set has clearly been revamped, 
so it begs the question: was MIA just 
a singular b-day show, or was it the 
mark of Beyoncé’s new realm of roy-
alty?

Even throughout the first minute 

or two of her set, it’s clear that it is 
the ladder. Beyond new choreogra-
phy, she chose to open with the sul-

try 2015 remix of “Crazy in Love” 
topped off with lip-biting and kiss 
blowing. She’s taken on the role of 
seductress. As she has gotten older, 
Bey has clearly become increasingly 
open with her sexuality (just ask 
Mike Huckabee). Beyoncé was the 
first album in which she got down 
and really dirty, and since then, she 
hasn’t let up much. “7-11” can be 
some filthy dance floor music in the 
right setting, and her appearance on 
“Feelin’ Myself” with Nicki Minaj 
isn’t something she would’ve been 
privy to long ago.

Nonetheless, her subtle transfor-

mations are more than her embrac-
ing of her sexuality. MIA is by far the 
most feminist context in which she 

has put herself. She boasts “FEMI-
NIST” as proudly as she did on the 
VMAs in 2014, but now she goes even 
further. The French section in “Par-
tition” is repeated in English during 
an interlude. “Do you like sex? Sex. 
I mean, the physical activity. Coitus. 
Do you like it? You’re not interested 
in sex? Men think that feminists hate 
sex, but it’s a very stimulating and 
natural activity that women love.” 
She also embraces fellow badass 
Ronda Rousey when she uses her 
“Do Nothing Bitch” quote as an intro 
to “Diva.” And even more intriguing 
is the new intro to “Grown Woman:” 
a reading of Maya Angelou’s “Phe-
nomenal Woman.” A single dancer 
moves gracefully as the poem is read.

Not only has she embraced her 

womanhood, it seems that she also 
managed to pick up a few tricks of 
the rap game while on tour with Jay. 
Her covers are typically glossy and 
high-class, like Whitney Houston or 
Lauryn Hill, but this set was cover-
less. However, the guest spots dur-
ing dance numbers where a special 
treat to the Philly crowd and will 
certainly be appreciated in whatever 
tour plans may arise. Not only did 
she go for her guest spot in “Feeling 
Myself,” but the unmistakable beat 
of “Truffle Butter” as well as “Trap 
Queen,” “Nasty Freestyle” and Lil 
Ronny MothaF’s “Circle” made sick 
cameos.

And finally, while the video of her 

new Naughty Boy-produced collab 
with Arrow Benjamin doesn’t quite 
resonate with all of this, her mes-
sage is there. The power in her voice 
equates with the badass-ness of her 
new persona. The defiance of “If I 
lose myself, I lose it all” speaks to her 
commitment to herself and her com-
mitment to genuinity.

After an extensive career, Bey has 

taken the best of the best, dropped 
the old and thrown some spice over-
top to create the most captivating 
Beyoncé show ever. It seems that, at 
the ripe age of 34, Beyoncé Knowles 
has reached the age where she is 
going to do whatever she damn well 
pleases … and that makes for the best 
Beyoncé yet.

Beyoncé is Beyoncé, will continue to be so

FILM REVIEW
Beautifully shot, but 
depressing ‘Everest’

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

If you don’t feel like risking 

your life to climb the most 
infamous mountain in the 
world, 
the 

view of Mount 
Everest in the 
all its IMAX 
3D 
glory 
is 

probably 
as 
good 
as 

you’ll 
get. 

The sweeping 
vistas of the 
mountain, captured in a depth 
that 
couldn’t 
be 
achieved 

without that extra dimension, 
make you feel like you’ve made 
it to the Nepalese mountains. 
But 
without 
that 
nasty 

frostbite that makes your toes 
fall off.

Aside from the magnificent 

views, 
“Everest” 
seeks 
to 

answer the looming question 
of why. Why would people 
risk 
everything 
they 
have 

for this? Director Baltasar 
Kormakur’s portrayal of the 
1996 expedition that claimed 
eight lives answers it with a 
display of the ferocity with 
which these people attempt to 
conquer the beast.

The 
cast 
does 
its 
best 

through the heavy parkas and 
facemasks to convey the tragic 

story. Australian guide Rob 
Hall (Jason Clarke, “Zero Dark 
Thirty”) must lead his group 
up the mountain alongside his 
rival guide, American hippie 
Scott Fisher (Jake Gyllenhaal, 
“Nightcrawler”). Hall’s wife, 
Jan, (Keira Knightley, “The 
Imitation Game”), is a climber 
as well but is pregnant, so she 
cannot go on the trip. Also in 
their crew is Jon Krakauer 
(Michael 
Kelly, 
“House 
of 

Cards”), a reporter who later 
captured the events in his 
book, “Into Thin Air,” the 
brash Texan Beck Weathers, 
(Josh Brolin, “Inherent Vice”) 
and the sole woman of the trip, 
Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori, 
“Humans”) 
who 
conquered 

the world’s Seven Summits by 
climbing Everest.

The 
backstories 
of 
the 

characters 
become 
less 

of 
a 
concern 
when 
the 

foreshadowing of the disaster 
ahead becomes fully clear. 
Aside from the literal corpses 
of past hikers they trek past, 
the communication via walkie-
talkie is lacking, there are 
missing oxygen bottles and 
there are far too many people 
on the mountain for safety. 
If people are willing to pay 
$65,000 for this trip, from an 
economic standpoint it would 
make sense to take more 

climbers. But from a safety 
standpoint, it feels reckless.

Much of the film focuses 

on 
this 
commodification 

of Everest. It’s become less 
of 
an 
conquest 
solely 
for 

experienced 
climbers 
and 

more of a fatal tourist trap. 
Especially after glacial ice 
crashed down Everest’s west 
side and killed 16 sherpas last 
year, it weighs heavy the risk 
that this business creates for 
everyone. The tour leaders, 
like Hall and Fisher, have 
an 
inherent 
contradiction 

in their jobs – they must aid 
these people in achieving their 
dreams of summiting Everest 
but they also have to get them 
down the mountain alive. With 
a terrible storm coming, these 
goals prove to be mutually 
exclusive.

The story is gut-wrenching. 

To see people deliberately go 
to their death with the film’s 
foreshadowing playing as a 
funeral march is emotional 
and tense. But the movie’s 
thick coats and voices muffled 
through wind and snow leaves 
too much unexplained. Its 
beauty is absolute, so much so 
that you think you can reach 
out and touch the snow on the 
peaks. But “Everest” makes 
it hard to justify that beauty 
with the cost of human lives.

Wheezing ‘Queens’

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

About halfway through the 

premiere of “Scream Queens,” 
a girl sits in her bedroom. She 
receives a text 
on her phone 
that says “Brave 
enough to open 
the door?” She 
does and her 
university’s Red 
Devil 
mascot 

enters the room. 
He 
texts 
her 

“Do you want to 
dance with the 
devil?” 
After 

they dance, he 
sends 
another 

text that says “I’m going to kill 
you now,” to which she responds 
“Wait what?!?!” over text and he 
proceeds to stab her.

Set in the Kappa Kappa Tau 

sorority house on the fictional 
Wallace 
University 
campus, 

“Scream Queens” follows what 
happens when a Red-Devil-suited 
axe murderer descends upon the 
residents. The show’s ensemble 
has a lot of talented actors and 
celebrities popping up in the first 
two hours, many of whom have 
worked with Murphy before. The 
cast is fronted by Emma Roberts 
(“American Horror Story”) as 
the president of the sorority, and 
Skyler Samuels (“The Nine Lives 
of Chloe King”) as a freshman 
who rushes to feel closer to her 
dead mother. Jamie Lee Curtis 
(“Freaky Friday”) plays the dean 
of students of the university. 
Ariana Grande (“Victorious”), 
Lea 
Michele 
(“Glee”), 
Niecy 

Nash (“Reno 911”), Nasim Pedrad 
(“Saturday Night Live”), Keke 
Palmer (“Masters of Sex”) and 

Abigail Breslin (“Little Miss 
Sunshine”) round out the cast.

“Scream Queen” ’s ensemble 

is 
among 
the 
strongest 
of 

the new fall pilots; however, 
they’re hampered by one-note 
characters. Roberts is probably 
the biggest victim of the group, 
as she’s saddled with a character 
who, at her core, is a stereotypical 
sorority girl. She has minions 
who do her work for her, holds 
her nose up at fatties and weirdos 
and orders pumpkin spice lattes. 
While the show attempts to play 
these characteristics as jokes, 
her character appears grating 
in almost every moment she’s 
on-screen, and Roberts can’t do 
much to improve upon that. Other 
actors such as Nash and Pedrad 
do well with comedic material, 
but don’t do much besides add a 
couple laughs. Even Curtis, who 
has accomplished a lot across her 
film career with thin characters, 
is hampered by a character who 
only plays different versions of 
angry.

The one thing that saves the 

show from mediocrity is that a few 
of the horror-comedy moments 
are quite effective — though not 
many are original. The scene 
described earlier is probably the 

only one that plays into the show’s 
sorority-girl elements and creates 
an entertaining scene. Nash also 
has some strong moments where 
she generates a lot of laughs as 
an incompetent security guard. 
However, other attempts at horror, 
including copious gross, bloodless 
deaths (it’s on FOX after all), and 
comedic elements (which include 
hazing gone-wrong and “weirdos” 
being creepy) that don’t land 
because they come off as neither 
scary nor funny. In particular, the 
show makes a lot of jokes at the 
expense of everyone from the deaf 
to the developmentally disabled 
that come off as mean and 
unnecessary, and squeeze out any 
of the fun from what came before.

If you’re reading this and 

thinking, 
“Screw 
this 
guy, 

‘Scream Queens’ sounds like a 
show I’d like,” then by all means 
give it a watch. You might find the 
characters to be more interesting 
and the horror and comedy 
elements to be more successful. 
However, for this critic, the 
show wastes talented cast with 
one-note characters and humor 
that comes off as mean, which 
overpowers some of the strong 
horror-comedic elements in the 
show.

LITERATURE COLUMN

“

And may the odds be ever 
in your favor,” announces 
an organizer of the fictional 

but gruesome Hunger Games, 
which end when all the contes-
tants but the 
winner have 
been mur-
dered. This 
chilling sen-
timent from 
Suzanne 
Collins’s 
post-
apocalyptic 
bestseller 
of the same 
name is an echo of the difficult 
times in which the book was 
published. “The Hunger Games,” 
published in 2008 during the 
Great Recession, swept the 
world into the trend of futuristic 
and dystopian novels. While a 
glimpse of doom or the super-
natural is not uncommon in 
American literature, depressing 
accounts of the ominous Ameri-
can future described in novels 
such as “The Maze Runner,” 
published in 2009, and “Diver-
gent,” published in 2011, came 
fast and furious throughout the 
Great Recession. Over the past 
few years, the market for dysto-
pian novels has become a very 
profitable mirror held to a world 
of anxiety and fear.

The Great Recession, the 

worst global recession since 
World War II, was caused by 
failures in financial regulation 
and the deflation of the housing 
market in mid-2007. It resulted 
in a drop in employment, finan-
cial uncertainty and a widening 
wealth disparity in the country. 
As of 2014, only 14 percent of 
the American workforce felt 
that they had fully recovered 
from the recession, indicating 
that for some, its effects will be 
felt for years to come.

In spite of the economic 

restlessness the recession 
caused, people did not want to 
be buoyed by their literature. 
Instead, they wanted to read 
about fictional societies doing 
things that were even worse 

than their own society was 
doing to them. The desire to 
put the fictional less-fortunate 
on display is reminiscent of 
the concept of “disaster porn.” 
It’s why people slow down to 
see the gore of a car crash and 
why horrible events are played 
over and over on a loop on the 
news. According to Emily God-
bey, a humanities professor at 
Albright College, it’s satisfying 
because “we’re able to experi-
ence the existential dilemma of 
human lives … (but) there’s no 
real risk.”

When “The Hunger Games” 

came out, I was on a lake with 
my friends and several parents. 
One of my friends, who was 16 
at the time, began to read from 
the novel. We were all trans-
fixed. At dinner that night, gone 
was the hushed discussion of 
finances and disappearing nest 
eggs. The topic of conversation 
was who at the table would sur-
vive the Hunger Games — and 
who would be killed within 
minutes. Although we were 
astonished by it, we could still 
talk and even laugh about this 
because the idea is so unreal. Of 
course our government would 
never force children to kill each 
other for sport. But it isn’t so 
absurd that we couldn’t let our 
imaginations run a bit wild and 
place ourselves in the setting 
just long enough to forget how 
bad things were in real life.

And yet, people have not 

always wanted to replace 
reality with imagined catas-
trophe. The earlier match for 
the Great Recession, the Great 
Depression, had a substantially 
cheerier tone in its entertain-
ment. Instead of craving more 
destruction and pain in their 
entertainment, the audiences of 
the early 1930s wanted to laugh 
at and root for their heroes and 
heroines.

The era’s more positive litera-

ture included fish-out-of-water 
stories like “White Collar Girl,” 
written by Faith Baldwin in 
1933, about a charming young 
collegiate woman who returned 

to work in her hometown to 
ease her family’s financial woes. 
There were many tales of adven-
ture, like the 1932 novel “Muti-
ny on the Bounty,” by Charles 
Nordhoff and James Norman 
Hall. And then there were nov-
els written that were just for 
fun, like Virginia Woolf’s imagi-
native “Flush: A Biography,” a 
view of city life told by Eliza-
beth Barrett Browning’s dog. In 
other realms of entertainment, 
comedy and singing acts like 
Shirley Temple, Judy Garland, 
and Fred Astaire dominated 
the movie theaters. People were 
eager to forget their worries 
through a few hours of hap-
piness, even when the dismal 
conditions made such a thing in 
short supply.

Entertainment has always 

represented a chance for escap-
ism. In the Great Depression, 
people looked to the light of 
happier days, perhaps because 
such days had been with them 
not long before during the 
ephemeral prosperity of the 
Roaring ’20s. People retreated 
into lightness because the 
downturn had been such a ter-
rifying quick reaction, an unex-
pected slap in the face to the 
entire country. But in the Great 
Recession, the memories of past 
few years in the wake of the 
harrowing terrorist attack on 
Sept. 11 and the anxiety that fol-
lowed it, haunted its entertain-
ment and turned it into the dark 
dystopias to which so many 
flock. The American public had 
been primed for doom through 
the disappointment of the early 
aughts, leading to novels full of 
death and despair. Though the 
memories of the Great Reces-
sion will be with us for years 
to come, the dystopian trend is 
winding down. Upon leaving 
the recession, maybe our coun-
try’s next beloved characters 
will find themselves in happier 
times.

FILM REVIEW
Compelling ‘Phoenix’

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

It’s the black of night, and a 

lone car is stopped by American 
soldiers at the border of Germany 
after 
the 

liberation 
of 
the 

concentration 
camps at the 
end of World 
War II. The 
young soldier 
peers 
inside 

and sees a tall, 
wise 
Jewish 

woman driving. In the passenger 
seat sits a woman with bandages 
wrapped around her face. She is 
curled up in a blanket, avoiding 
the soldier’s gaze, but he demands 
she remove her bandages so he 
can see her face. We only see the 
soldier’s expression as she finally 
does. We see his eager smile 
sucked away. He swallows and 
lets them pass.

Writer-director 
Christian 

Petzold 
(“Barbara”)’s 
latest 

film, “Phoenix,” doesn’t hit you 
right away. It begins slow and 
contemplative. Nelly (Nina Hoss, 
a regular in Petzold movies 
like 
“Jerichow”), 
recovering 

from 
facial 
reconstruction 

surgery after she was rendered 
unrecognizable by a passing 
bullet, glimpses her new self in 
a shard of broken glass. She’s 
not happy. The only friend she 
has is Lene (Nina Kunzendorf, 
“Unspoken”), a surrogate mother 
who pays her constant attention 
throughout her recovery. No one 
from her old life knows she’s still 
alive. Most are dead, indicated 
by crosses scrawled above their 
heads on old photographs. But 
there’s one face without that 
fateful 
cross: 
her 
husband, 

Johnny 
(Ronald 
Zehrfeld, 

“Barbara”).

As Nelly sets to rebuild her 

life, everyone urges her to take 
advantage of this opportunity 
to restart. Her doctor, before 
the surgery, suggests she pick 
a 
completely 
different 
face, 

like that of a beautiful movie 
star. Lene wants her to move 
to Palestine with her, where 
they’ll both be safer than there in 
Germany. Nelly rejects all these 
suggestions. She just wants her 
old life back: the same face, the 
same friends and most of all, the 
same husband.

When 
Nelly 
finally 
finds 

Johnny, instead of telling him all 
that happened, she finds herself 
pretending to be someone else 
— pretending to be someone 
quite like herself, but not the 
same, because she’s afraid of the 
rumors, the idea that Johnny was 
the one who betrayed her and sent 
her to the camps in the first place. 
So Johnny and Nelly enter into a 
shocking, twisted relationship, 
with Nelly impersonating herself 
to help Johnny collect her 
inheritance money. All the while, 
Johnny observes her constantly, 
the gears in his brain turning. 
Who is this woman who looks so 
remarkably like his dead wife?

One of the most impressive 

accomplishments of “Phoenix” 
is its ability to avoid the pitfalls 
of its somewhat unbelievable 
premise. 
In 
a 
soap 
opera 

melodrama, Johnny would be 
a cartoonish villain, a greedy, 
soulless sociopath who only 
cares about money, but it’s 
clear he loves Nelly, regardless 
of whether or not the rumors 
are true. Just as easily, it could 
strain credibility that he can’t 
recognize Nelly when she has 
the same voice and the same 
general appearance. Yet perhaps 
somewhere deep inside Johnny, 

he knows it’s her from the very 
beginning. 
Even 
when 
Nelly 

emerges in her old favorite dress 
with her hair re-dyed to match 
her old self and asks, “Do you 
recognize me?” Johnny pushes her 
away. Denial is a powerful thing.

The 
biggest 
risk 
from 
a 

narrative standpoint is delaying 
the inevitable confrontation in 
which Johnny will realize his 
wife is still alive. From Nelly and 
Johnny’s very first scene together, 
it’s easy to groan and wonder, “Are 
we really going to have to wait until 
the last scene for him to figure 
this out?” Waiting so long could 
feel like plot-mandated wheel-
spinning, but the film overcomes 
that trap by imbuing every scene 
with magnificent tension building 
towards the day when Nelly will 
come out of hiding.

If there is a flaw in the film, it 

lies in a third-act twist of sorts, 
a reveal of new information that 
could’ve just as easily come early 
on but must wait until the end 
so that the climax can be timed 
correctly. It’s also paired with a 
barely telegraphed tragic turn that 
feels unnecessarily grim. Still, as 
clumsy as this sequence may come 
across to some viewers, it serves 
its purpose well, setting up a 
ferociously tense climax devoid of 
extraneous characters or subplots.

Even if the rest of the film 

had disappointed, it’d be worth 
sticking around just for the 
final scene, which finds Petzold, 
cinematographer Hans Fromm 
(yet another of Petzold’s regulars) 
and the film’s outstanding cast 
firing on all cylinders. Almost 
certainly 2015’s best final scene, 
it’s 
an 
awe-inspiring 
display 

of suspense, shock, regret and 
devastation. As the lens blurs and 
the world silently falls to black, 
tears will spill and hearts will stop. 
It’s unforgettable.

Harbaugh sticks up 
for starter Rudock

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Five interceptions in three 

games 
for 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback 
Jake 
Rudock 

led fans to question Rudock’s 
performance at the helm of the 
Michigan football team’s offense.

But coach Jim Harbaugh isn’t 

having it.

Asked Monday in his weekly 

press conference what areas 
Rudock can improve, Harbaugh 
said simply, “There’s areas.”

When pressed to specify which 

areas, he vigorously defended his 
offense.

“The question, to me, just the 

way you started the question 
after the game, questions to 
divide and compare, we’re all 
working,” Harbaugh said. “We’re 
all working to get better.

“I 
sense 
sometimes 
the 

questions to compare and be 
divisive. I’m quick to turn those 
off.”

He didn’t turn off the next 

question — rather, he gave a vote 
of confidence for Rudock.

“To be clear, Jake Rudock 

is the best quarterback. Not by 
a small margin, he’s our best 
quarterback,” Harbaugh said. 
“And when it comes to precision 
of the passing game and the 
timing, that’s something that 
we’re all working together at.”

Still, the statistics show a need 

for improvement.

While Rudock has proved a 

capable game manager and his 
receivers have made plays, the 
passing game has yet to establish 
a 
rhythm. 
The 
Wolverines’ 

longest pass play of the season is 
28 yards. Every Big Ten team has 
one longer — even the struggling 
offenses of Penn State, Rutgers 
and Maryland.

Rudock has overthrown deep 

balls in every game, but his 
receivers are quick to share the 

blame. They anticipate seeing an 
improvement soon.

“It’s 
getting 
there,” 
said 

redshirt junior wide receiver 
Jehu Chesson. “I don’t think I 
can say we’ve completed a deep 
pass, but his confidence is there. 
In terms of getting us in the 
right plays, checking, audibles, 
that nature, he’s doing great. 
The passing game will come. I’m 
very confident that it will. He’s 
very confident that it will. Coach 
Harbaugh is very confident that 
it will.”

Rudock, a fifth-year senior 

with plenty of experience, has 
other assets, too. He picks up the 
play or a choice of plays from the 
sidelines. Then, he decides the 
one he thinks will be better, or 
even calls an audible at the line.

On a more micro level, Chesson 

also said he does a nice job of 
enunciating the play calls in the 
huddle. It might seem minor, 
but with players fatigued and 
the stadium contributing noise, 
a couple of miscommunicated 
words can switch the play.

All of these factors go into 

Michigan’s 
impression 
of 

Rudock, and all of them lower the 
anxiety level inside the program 
as compared to outside of it.

“At the end of the day, nobody 

really sees the 90 percent that 
goes into the game, only the 
10 percent that we have to 
execute that Saturday,” Chesson 
said. “We’re judged by our 
performance, and (that’s) how 
it should be. But at the same 
time, if we could understand 
how hard this kid works leading 
from Sunday after the game to 
Saturday to get the whole team 
prepared, it’s amazing.”

Rudock was not available to 

the media Monday afternoon 
or after the game Saturday, but 
when he talked after the games 
against Utah and Oregon State, 
he took responsibility for his 

mistakes.

He and the receivers will 

shift their focus ahead toward 
cleaning up the deep passing 
game and making it a threat in 
the coming weeks.

“It’s 
definitely 
something 

that’s emphasized, because we 
do need to do that,” Chesson 
said. “We have the ability to do 
that, so we’re only short-handing 
ourselves if we don’t attempt to 
do it and if we don’t execute it 
either.”

The Wolverines know it’s 

important for them to establish 
timing sooner rather than later. 
No. 22 Brigham Young comes 
to town this weekend, and then 
Big Ten play opens, with a home 
game against No. 2 Michigan 
State looming on Oct. 17.

The power running game has 

gotten Michigan to 2-1, but it 
might not always be enough.

“When the bullets start flying 

and guys start thinking, you’re 
just trained for that situation,” 
Chesson said. “You do what 
you’re trained to do.”

Perhaps an improvement in 

that area will help Michigan 
establish an offensive identity. 
Harbaugh 
said 
Monday 
he 

doesn’t have a word for its 
identity yet, and Chesson added 
that the Wolverines get a chance 
to prove it every week. They’ll 
get another opportunity against 
BYU, and a chance to solidify it 
with consistency at Maryland 
after that.

It’s up to the quarterback 

and the receivers, but the onus 
inevitably falls largely on Rudock 
either way, fair or unfair.

“The nature of the position 

is, you get too much glory when 
you’re doing great, and you get 
too much ridicule when you’re 
doing bad,” Chesson said. “But 
I think he has a very level head. 
Things are going to click for us. I 
really do believe it.”

Trips provide a learning 
experience for Michigan

By ALEX KHALIFEH

Daily Sports Writer

The trips were far from 

home, and the Michigan men’s 
tennis team split up, heading to 
different parts of the country 
this past weekend. Such is 
life 
when 

preseason 
begins on the 
road.

And 
while 

starting 
with 
two 

out-of-state 
tournaments 
may 
seem 

like a hectic 
road trip, for 
Michigan, 
it’s just what it wanted to 
prepare its youthful group. The 
Wolverines sent sophomores 
Carter Lin and Davis Crocker to 
California and freshmen Myles 
Schalet and Gabe Tishman to 
New Jersey.

The sophomores participated 

in 
the 
Battle 
of 
the 
Bay 

Invitational, where they faced 
California 
and 
San 
Diego, 

among 
others, 
and 
played 

in both singles and doubles 
competition.

In doubles action, Lin’s and 

Crocker’s strong performances 
propelled 
them 
against 

Southern California, 8-7. Yet 
Saturday, the Wolverines fell to 
San Francisco’s Nils Skajaa and 
Thomas Takemoto in a tightly 
contested 8-7 loss.

Lin 
advanced 
to 
the 

semifinals before falling to the 
Golden Bears’ Flip Bergevi in 
straight sets. Lin’s other two 
singles opponents, California’s 
Oskar Wikberg and San Diego’s 
Slip Vittek, fell to Lin in two and 
three sets, respectively.

Opposite Lin was Crocker, 

who faced difficulty against 

Wikberg, falling in straight 
sets, 6-4 and 6-1. The loss put 
Crocker into a consolation draw, 
where he found success against 
Pepperdine’s Stefan Menichella, 
whom he defeated in straight 
sets. Crocker, however, bowed 
out in a three-set match to 

the 
Toreros’ 

James 
Ponwith.

2,800 miles 

across 
the 

country 
was 

the Princeton 
Invitational, 
which 
held 

the debut of 
freshmen 
Myles 
Schalet 
and 

Gabe Tishman, both of whom 
participated 
in 
their 
first 

tournaments as Wolverines.

Schalet 
advanced 
to 
the 

semifinal portion of singles 
competition after two straight-

set victories over Darmouth’s 
Max Schmidt and Wisconsin’s 
Lamar Remy. Saturday in his 
last matchup, a semifinal draw 
against Cornell’s Colin Sinclair, 
Schalet fell in three sets, 6-3, 
5-7 and 6-3.

Rather than focus on the 

results of each match, coaches 
came away pleased by what they 
saw out of their roster.

“They want to do great 

things for Michigan, and that’s 
awesome,” 
said 
Michigan 

associate 
head 
coach 
Sean 

Maymi. “But we also want them 
to focus on the right things. So 
if they start thinking about the 
result as opposed to the process 
and how to get that result, 
they’re gonna have trouble.

“It was good for me to 

see some of (Schalet’s and 
Tishman’s) 
strengths 
and 

weaknesses. Both of them did 
a great job of just competing 
hard.”

Yurovsky represents ‘M’ in 
new California tournament

By BEN KIM 

Daily Sports Writer

It’s an uncommon sight to 

see when someone competes for 
Michigan with no other team 
members around.

For 19th-ranked senior Ronit 

Yurovsky, she had to do just that 
in the inaugural Oracle/ITA 
Masters tournament. She was the 
lone Wolverine representing the 
Michigan women’s tennis team 
in Malibu, Calif., to start off the 
season. Yurovsky was unable to 
find success, losing in the first 
round of the championship and 
consolation bracket.

“Result-wise, I wish (this 

weekend) went a little bit better,” 
Yurovsky said. “Playing-wise, I 
feel pretty good out on the court. 
It was the first tournament back. 
I think I struggled a bit with 
confidence because I haven’t 
played that many matches (over 
the summer). Just looking ahead, 
I think this weekend was good 
just to get me back into competing 
again.”

Yurovsky faced ninth-ranked 

Hayley Carter of North Carolina 

in the first round. Carter put the 
pressure on early, jumping to a 
4-0 lead. Yurovsky was able to 
roar back, taking the next three 
games to cut Carter’s lead to 4-3. 
But her efforts weren’t enough, as 
Carter was able to take two of the 
next three games and the set, 6-4.

The next set was more evenly 

played, but ultimately Carter 
prevailed. The two split the first 
eight games, 4-4. Yurovsky 
would go on to win two of the 
next three, putting her in position 
to win the set. However, Carter 
was able to force a tiebreaker 
and eventually won the set and 
match, 7-6.

In 
the 
consolation 
round 

on the second day of the 
tournament, Yurovsky faced off 
against Vanderbilt’s 14th-ranked 
Astra Sharma. In the first set, 
each player took turns winning 
two games in a row until they had 
four games apiece.

Yurovsky didn’t win another 

game in that set as Sharma closed 
out for a 6-4 win. In the second 
set, Sharma won five of the first 
six games. Yurovsky tried to 
make up the deficit, but came up 

short, losing 6-4 and ending her 
stint in the tournament.

“Hayley (Carter) was tough. 

She’s a really good player and 
so is Astra (Sharma),” Yurovsky 
said. “Everyone’s good there. 
It’s the top 16 players, so you’re 
not gonna get a bad match. I just 
focused on having that belief, 
that confidence that I could win 
the match, but I just couldn’t pull 
it out in the important points.”

This 
tournament, 
in 
its 

inaugural year, was uncharted 
territory for the lone senior, 
especially since she had no 
teammates competing with her.

Yurovsky will have plenty of 

time to regroup and prepare for 
her next competition, but will 
need to get used to being the 
only Wolverine present when she 
heads to the ITA All-American 
tournament on October 8.

“I’m a little bummed this 

weekend didn’t go as planned, 
but I’m excited because I knew 
I was playing well,” Yurovsky 
said. “I’m glad I got two matches 
under my belt, so going into All-
Americans, I’m back into the 
swing of things.”

Michigan’s defensive goal? Turnovers and more turnovers

By MAX COHEN 

Managing Sports Editor

Three games into the season, 

the Michigan football team does 
not yet have a definitive identity. 
The offense has mixed and 
matched pieces, and the team’s 
defenders have given their own 
unit varying reviews.

But spending just a few minutes 

with senior linebacker James 
Ross 
and 
junior 
cornerback 

Jourdan Lewis makes it clear 
what the Wolverines’ defense 
wants its identity to be.

They arrived to their media 

availability Monday wearing the 
same logo — Lewis wore it on a 
fleece sweatshirt, and Ross wore 
it on his baseball cap. The logo 
had the wings of a carnivorous 
bird with a skull head between. 
It read “Ballhawks.” Defensive 

coordinator DJ Durkin has given 
out the gear since the spring, as a 
reward for creating turnovers in 
practice.

The 
gear 
is 
a 
way 
to 

emphasize what has been an 
area of weakness for Michigan 
in recent years. Last season, the 
Wolverines recorded just five 
interceptions 
and 
recovered 

five fumbles, which was tied for 
108th among all Football Bowl 
Subdivision schools.

The need to create takeaways 

has been a constant teaching 
point in practice ever since the 
new coaching staff took over. 
They have drilled it into the 
players’ heads to the point that 
it is a mantra the players often 
repeat.

“When we get on that field, we 

want to get that ball back for our 
offense,” Ross said.

The new strategy manifests 

itself in multiple ways. When 
tacklers hit ball carriers, they are 
encouraged to do so with force 
and to make an effort to punch 
out the ball.

“We probably coach turnovers 

more than any defense I’ve ever 
been around, and in the camp 
and throughout practices we’ve 
had more turnovers than I can 
ever remember,” said Michigan 
defensive 
line 
coach 
Greg 

Mattison last week.

Mattison has held defensive 

coaching positions with eight 
different colleges and one NFL 
organization since 1977.

So far, the new mentality 

most evidently paid off when 
Michigan played Oregon State 
in the second game of the season 
and junior defensive end Taco 
Charlton knocked the ball out 

of the grasp of Beavers’ running 
back Victor Bolden. Michigan 
senior linebacker Joe Bolden 
snatched the ball out of the air in 
what became a game-changing 
play.

“We just learn to be way 

more aggressive than we’ve ever 
been,” Ross said. “That’s ripping 
the ball out, that’s making it 
very uncomfortable for the ball 
carriers no matter what. I’m 
not saying I punch the ball out 
rather than make the tackle. It’s 
not that. It’s just I’m reaching for 
that ball every time I’m taking 
you down.”

The secondary takes a similar 

approach with balls in the air. 
With the way they speak about 
their desire for interceptions, it’s 
as though they believe they have 
the same opportunity to catch a 
ball as the intended receiver.

Lewis had four pass breakups 

in 
Michigan’s 
win 
against 

UNLV. For some cornerbacks, 
the absence of pass breakups is 
viewed as a positive. It merely 
means the offense is scared to 
attack them. Lewis is different. 
He hopes the passes keep coming 
his way.

“Honestly, I wanted a pick,” 

Lewis said. “Pass breakups are 
great, but the ultimate goal is the 
interception.”

Lewis 
will 
have 
another 

chance 
to 
prove 
his 
point 

Saturday against No. 22 Brigham 
Young. The Cougars are a team 
unafraid to air out the football, 
illustrated 
by 
quarterback 

Tanner 
Mangum’s 
47 
pass 

attempts in his team’s loss to 
UCLA last weekend.

Mangum, a freshman, took 

over the starting job when 

Taysom Hill was injured in 
BYU’s season opener. He has 
had bright moments and game-
winning drives early on, but the 
Wolverines will attempt to lure 
him into mistakes.

Lewis asserted Monday that 

Michigan’s secondary can be 
the best in the country. The 
unit recorded two interceptions 
Saturday to bring its total to 
three this season. Ross went a 
step further than Lewis, saying 
that he believes the entire 
defense can be the best in the 
country. He thought back to 
four-hour spring practices and 
the Wolverines’ taxing fall camp 
in stating his opinion.

“It would be criminal to not 

think we could be the best,” Ross 
said. “When you put in so much 
work, that’s the only belief you 
have.”
