House rep. defends bill that
would fine 'U' for contracts

Leader of forUM
threatens UEC suit
after confrontation
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily News Reporter
A seemingly innocuous cam-
paign e-mail sent by the party
chair of forUM to members of his
fraternity has quickly escalated
to a threat of filing lawsuits with
the Central Student Govern-
ment's University Election Com-
mission, according to a series of
messages obtained by The Michi-
gan Daily.
Eaghan Davis, forUM's chair,
sent an e-mail Wednesday to a
non-University listserv of the
members of the Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity, of which he is a mem-
ber. The e-mail encouraged
brothers to vote for forUM in the
election and ended saying "This
is who we're running against"
followed by the headshot of LSA
freshman Nick Swider, the presi-
dential candidate for momen-
tUM.
A member of the listserv sent
the e-mail to LSA junior Jill
Clancy, the momentUM vice
presidential candidate, who then
e-mailed Davis.
"I expected more professional
tactics from you as party chair,"
Clancy wrote to Davis. "I feel
it is inappropriate that you are
emphasizing physical appear-
ance above our platform and

what we envision for our Univer-
sity."
Davis responded, apologizing
for the "crude joke to fraternity
brothers that was in poor taste."
However, Davis didn't stop there.
"Clearly I'm disappointed that
a member of my own fraternity
showed you an email,but I would
also like to remind you that our
legal team has 6 violations of the
UEC election code by momen-
tUM," Davis wrote.
"If you go public with this
email - we will submit every
UEC violation," Davis added.
Davis also offered to include
Clancy on a lawsuit forUM
plans to file against youMICH
Wednesday.
In a joint statement, Swider
and Clancy said they were upset
with the initial e-mail, but more
so at the ensuing e-mail from
Davis.
"What's even more unfortu-
nate is that it was followed by a
foul play - a threat to derail our
campaign that has focused on
no ethos more than a clean cam-
paign," the statement said. "It's
especially disappointing that
any of the candidates would have
to deal with this kind of issue,
especially when we each prom-
ise so much to the University in
the interest to better the learning
experience for the students."

Lane, forUM's communications
director, said Davis is not the
person in charge of legal affairs

Pscholka: I'm
standing up
for students
By BEN ATLAS
Daily News Reporter
Last week, state Rep. Al
Pscholka (R-Stevensville), chair
of the Appropriations Subcom-
mittee on Higher Education,
proposed a higher-education

budget bill that would increase
funding by $31 million, though
the University would lose 15
percent of state funding.
College administrators have
been vocal against the measure
because it penalizes universities
that agree to union contracts
before the so-called right-to-
work law takes effect, though
Pscholka says the universities
who do so are being unfair to
students.
"What's really unfair is that U

of M students and parents have
paid a 90-percent increase in
tuition over the last 10 years,"
Pscholka said. "My bill includes
a $31-million increase in higher
education. Some universities
have chosen to participate in
that increase, others have taken
the choice not to participate."
The bill stipulates that if
any higher education institu-
tion signed or extended a new
union contract before unions
are banned from requiring all

members of a workplace to pay
union dues, it would be ineligi-
ble for the state's "performance
funding" unless the contract
saves at least10 percent in costs.
This portion of funding would
amount to $41 million for the
University for the 2013-2014
academic year.
The University, along with
several other higher-education
institutionsinthestate,renewed

SUSTAINABILITY
Group wants to
rid endowment
of investment
in fossil fuels

New campus
organization hopes
to raise awareness
of revenue sources
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
The University has divested
funds from its endowment for
social reasons only twice - the
first time from South Africa dur-
ing apartheid, the other from
tobacco companies in 2000. A
group of students on campus,
the Divest and Invest Campaign,
wants to make fossil fuels the
University's third target.
Rackham student Dave Mar-
vin, a leader of Divest and Invest,
said the campaign wants the Uni-
versity to divest from companies
"primarily involved in the extrac-
tion, production, transport, or
burning of fossil fuels," which
accounts for about $900 million
of the nearly $8-billion endow-
ment.
According to Marvin, the
$900-million figure came mainly
from Freedom Of Information
Act requests but doesn't account
for private equity or venture capi-
tal portions of the endowment.

Marvin said that the first step
of divestment would be to pro-
hibit any new investment in these
companies. A five-year period of
divestment would then follow,
but he noted that the campaign
is aware that the University has
some contractual agreements
with companies that make the
five-year goal a soft deadline.
"The goal of divestment is not
to financially harm these com-
panies. We have no illusions that
we could ever do such a thing,"
Marvin said. "It really is about
drawing attention to the perni-
cious practices of the industry in
terms of their contributions to
politicians, contributions to think
tanks which are running a sus-
tained campaign to discredit the
science of climate change."
On Monday, Erik Lundberg,
the University's chief investment
officer, told members of the Sen-
ate Advisory Committee that the
Board of Regents has established
a policy of selecting investments
based on potential returns, not
social or political purposes.
"We can't let our personal
views influence the investments
we pursue," he said.

By GIACOMO BOLOGNA

After youMICH released a
video early this week in which
student personality "Da'Quan
Carter" endorses the youMICH
candidates for president and
vice president, students took
to social media to denounce or
defend the campaign material.
The video was originally post-
ed on youMICH's facebook page
but has since been replacedwith
an apologetic statement, which
said the video was "intended to
be a light-hearted promotional
video done for the campaign by
a campus comedian:'
The post continues, saying,
"Our intention was never to
be racially insensitive--it was
never meant to come at the
expense of any racial identity. "
Some people believe the charac-
ter - played by a white student
- portrays offensive stereo-
types of African Americans.

Dingell reflects on federal

Congressman

By ASHWINI NATARAJAN
Daily StaffReporter
At the Ford School of Pub-
lic Policy on Wednesday, Rep.
John Diygell (D-Mich.) gave
his views on the nation's issues
to a 25-person panel of the

University's chapter of The
Can Kicks Back, a millennial
organization striving to fix the
national debt.
The event was in honor of
the organization founding of a
University chapter. Members
of TCKB partner, the national
Fix the Debt campaign, and
students attended.
The topic of discussion
focused mostly on the effects
of the growing national debt
on the younger generations,

also covering major topics such
as climate change and how the
deficit is shaping federal law.
Dingell said Congress has
to fully understand the fiscal
problems they're voting on
and make sure legislative mea-
sures passed are fully carried
through.
"It's not just the making of
the budget; It's making sure
the budget is properly imple-
mented," Dingell said. "This is

Ann Arbor City
Councilmember Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1), who gradaated
from LSA in 1986, has served
on the council since 2007. An
advocate for recycling and
solving other city issues, she
is running for re-election
this year.
Are there any experiences
you had during your time
as a student thnt you use
in your career today?
I studied history and took
political science for fun, but
the real benefit I got from
the University was actually
learning how to research,
how to look at documents,

evaluate them and write up
a report.
As a city council member,
what University issues do
you help solve?
The biggest issues that
the council deals with are
places where town and Uni-
versity don't mix well. One
of those is the University's
expansion into the city,
acquisition of buildings and
not having to follow city
ordinances. Another place
where I run into a problem
is inevitably student behav-
ior. I'm not talking about
students who over-indulge
in alcohol on football Sat-

urdays or have loud par-
ties. I'm talking about the
fact that people who are
newly leaving home haven't
yet begun to recognize that
what they do in public is
public.
What is the most gratify-
ing aspect of your career?
The mostcgratifying aspect
of sitting on city council is
helping to solve problems.
My goal is to make the city
to work better for the people
who live here, whether they
live here for decades like I
have or they foolishly decide
to leave.

Group submits
petitions for vote
on wolf hunting
A coalition of environmental
and animal welfare groups says
it has filed petitions seeking a
statewide referendum on wolf
hunting.
The group called Keep Michi-
gan Wolves Protected submitted
253,705 signatures to the secre-
tary of state's office in Lansing
on Wednesday.
If officials verify that at least
161,305 of the signatures are
valid, the issue could be placed
on the November 2014 election

Snyder signs
$23M bill for
recreation
Gov. Rick Snyder has signed
legislation to spend $23 mil-
lion for land purchases, trail
upgrades and other recreation
projects.
The money in the bill signed
Wednesday comes from the
Michigan Natural Resources
Trust Fund, which consists of
royalties from sales and leases
of state-owned mineral rights.
Most of the 76 grants will go
to local governments that also
cover part of the projects' costs.
The biggest grant goes to
Hayes Township in Charlev-
oix County, which gets $3.4
million to buy 20 acres with
1,400 feet of Lake Charlevoix
shoreline. It previously was the
location of a summer camp.

Guantanamo
prisoners say guards
withold water
Prisoners taking part in an
expanding hunger strike at
Guantanamo Bay leveled new
complaints about their military
jailers Wednesday as a team
from the International Com-
mittee of the Red Cross made a
fact-finding trip to the U.S. base
in Cuba.
In an emergency motion filed
with a federal court in Wash-
ington, lawyers say guards have
refused to provide drinking
water to hunger strikers and kept
camp temperature "extremely
frigid," to thwart the protest.
A spokesman for the detention
center denied the allegations.
"The reality is that these men
are slowly withering away and
we as a country need to take
immediate action," said Mari
Newman, a human rights lawyer
based in Denver, who was among
those who submitted the motion.
ATHENS, Greece
Bomb explodes
near Acropolis in

central Athens
A bomb exploded outside a
Greek ship owner's house near a
crowded pedestrian area under
the Acropolis in central Athens
on Wednesday night, causing
minor damage but no injuries,
police said.
The explosion a few hundred
meters from the country's most
famous monument occurred at
about 8:30 p.m., after a warning
call to a Greek newspaper.
There was no immediate
claim of responsibility for the
blast, which follows a string of
bomb attacks in the financially-
struggling country by anarchist
groups that have caused no
major injuries or loss of life.
Police spokesman Panagiotis
Papapetropoulos said officers
were able before the blast to
evacuate one or two people from
the building and to seal off the
area.
"Judging by the minor extent
of the damage, it can't have been
a very strong explosive device,"
he said.

"Mr. Davis is the party chair,

Swider released an individu-

disappointment with the inci-

"I am incredibly disappoint-

"Obviously, I don't give a damn
about a personal attack against

This incident, however, illu-
minates a larger issue - pre-
paring and filing complaints to
gain a competitive advantage
over other campaigns. Com-
plaints are heard by the UEC,

can results in demerits. Par-

be issued 10 and five demerits
respectively before they're dis-

CONTRACTS
From Page 1A
the last week before right to

Collective bargaining units rep-

announced that union members
from five different labor groups
have ratified new tentative
agreements with the Univer-
sity over the last few weeks: the
American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employ-
ees; the Graduate Employees'
Organization; the House Offi-
cers Association; the Lecturers'
Employee Organization and the
Michigan Nurses Association.
Together, these five unions rep-
resent about 11,000 University
employees.
The recently ratified agree-
ments - which will last four
to five years, depending on
the organization - don't ful-
fill Pscholka's 10-percent cut
threshold.
"While it's not completely
clear how the 10 percent would
be measured, we do not believe
10 percent savings is achiev-
able," University spokesman
Rick Fitzgerald said in an email.

"It's also about putting our
values here at the University of

ing that as a socially responsible
institution we should be socially
responsible in our investments,"
Pfeiffer said.

Marvin said that while the
energy sector of the Univer-
sity's endowment has been the
"top performer" during the last
decade, past success doesn't
ensure future success.
"You can't use historical
returns to predict the future.
That's just poor investment
practice," Marvin said. "So
the argument that the energy
industry has done terrific and
will continue to do terrific just
because it has been doing well
doesn't have any basis in reality."

"My impression is that the
way that these things normally
work is that you don't take any
legal action really until after
the election is over or until
very close to the election being

Lane added that forUM has
been doing nothing out of the

"Everything that we are

other parties are doing. It's
exactly what the other par-
ties are doing," Lane said. "It's

"Cost-saving measures are
a good thing that can help you
save tuitiondollars and still have
a good, high-quality education,"
Pscholka said. "Chances are
your parents aren't getting five-
and eight-year contract exten-
sions with guaranteed raises."
Though some feel universi-
ties are being attacked by the
bill, Pscholka said he is simply
standing up for his constituents.
"If some universities choose
not to participate in the (spend-
ing) increase, that's their choice,
not mine, and they should be
held accountable for it," Pschol-
ka said. "It seems everybody has
a lobbyist (in Lansing) except
students and parents and tax-
payers. So I plan to be a lobbyist
for students, parents and tax-
payers."
Pscholka questioned the
University's motives for get-
ting a contract done earlier this
month, consideringthe impend-
ing change to union's rights in
the state.
Negotiations for the LEO
contract began back in Novem-
ber, before the right-to-work
legislation was passed. Fitzger-

ical for these negotiations.

until (Thursday), and that's
what the legislature approved,"
Fitzgerald said.
range of students, the campaign
has partnered with numerous
organizations, including the
Program in the Enviornment
club, the Public Health Sustain-
ability Initiative, Students for
Clean Energy and the Student
Sustainability Initiative. Pfiefer
said the group plans to raise
awareness on campus by attend-
ing regents' meetings and host-
ing a DiagsDay on April 3.
The movement has not been
met with widespread acceptance.

While LSA Student Govern-
ment passed a resolution in sup-
port of divestment from fossil
fuels two weeks ago, the Cen-
tral Student Government voted
down a similar resolution after
weeks of deliberation.
Rackham Rep. Wonwoo Lee
voted in favor of the resolution
to support divestment from fos-
sil fuels.
"As an institution - as the
Leaders and the Best - we real-
ly, truly have to consider these
institutional divestments as a
necessary measure to curb cli-
mate change," Lee said.
The video was also brought
up at Tuesday night's CSG
assembly meeting when LSA
sophomore Chavon Taylor
addressed the assembly in
community concerns.
"A lot of people in my com-
munity - the African-Amer-
ican community - were very
offended by this video," Tay-
lor said, adding that the video
was "ignorant" and "insensi-
tive."
At the meeting, CSG presi-
dent Manish Parikh said he

Business junior Scott
Christopher, the independent
presidential candidate, LSA
sophomore Laurel Ruza, the
chair of youMICH, and Clancy
said they don't plan on holding
or preparing any complaints
to file on Thursday. All three,
however, declined to absolute-
ly rule that possibility out.
"I do know some people are
thinking of strategies on how
to file lawsuits, but we haven't
put much thought into that,"
Christopher said.
Ruza noted the negative
connotation with filing com-
plaints late.
"We try not to wait until
the last minute," Ruza said. "I
think that does look like you're
trying to kick somebody out
specifically."
Ruza said that when suits
are filed to counter other suits,
smaller infractions that are
commonly ignored might come
into play.
"If we're being attacked with
small violations and that sort
we do have those violations that
we've seen as well," Ruza said.
"It's nothing that we want to
embark on, but at some point
parties start doing these stra-
tegic little petty UEC violations
and it kind of is a back and forth
at that point."
Pscholka emphasized that
the government and the pub-
lic should act with a greater
sense of urgency in dealingwith
tuition costs and other fiscal
issues, noting that the country
is in $78 to $90 trillion in debt
and unfunded liabilities.
"I'm not trying to go after
unions, not trying to screw
anybody," Pscholka said. "I'm
very concerned about the fis-
cal condition of the nation and
the state. I'm not going to spend
money I don't have, and I'm not
going to put more debt on the
next generation."
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said ratifying LEO's
new contract was not just about
combating right to work, but
also "about trying to make up
for a chronic issue of underpay-
inglecturers." Pscholka claimed
that old labor contracts for Uni-
versity employees compensated
them fairly.
Irwin said he also felt that
the motives for Pscholka's bill
were different than those that
he had expressed.
"(Republicans) want to
hamper the effectiveness of
labor unions because it serves
their political interests," Irwin
said. "The reason Republicans
passed right to work is because
they wanted to weaken the
Democratic Party. It's all about
politics - it has nothing to do
with good public policy."
LSA junior Russ Hayes, an
LSA representative, said he
doesn't think divestments are
something student government
should focus on.
"We're a student government
that ought to be supporting real-
istic, tangible, impactful reso-
lutions for campus," he said. "I
don't think the divestment reso-
lution, while well-intentioned,
met those goals."
The issue has also become
an issue in the CSG presidential

elections. The Divest and Invest
campaign endorsed forUM can-
didates.
forUM, the Defend Affir-
mative Action Party and the
campaign of independent Scott
Christopher said they support-
ed divestment from fossil fuels
in individual statements. you-
MICH, however, said that while
it supports sustainability, divest-
ment is not the best solution.
"YouMICH supports sustain-
able efforts on campus through
research and clean energy,"
the statement read. "However,
divestment from the 900 million
dents are doing anything that
may be insensitive toward
other students, it should always
be brought to the attention of
the campus, not just during an
election.
"Whenever such content
anywhere on campus happens
for any community, I think all
of us should be vigilant about
this throughout the year," he
said, adding that he believes

your government. I work for you."
Dingell also spoke about his
rebuttal to Congressman Paul
Ryan's (R-Wis.) budget plan. He
said Ryan has been vague and
misleading with his use of future
tax reforms, and claimed his
policies are not geared towards
increasing affordability for U.S.
citizens.
"Frankly, it's fiction," Dingell
said. "He takes and repeals all of
the Affordable Care Acts, except
things that are going to increase
federal revenue. He eliminates
all the things that are going to
provide additional care."
Dingell is against Ryan's
replacement of Medicare's
defined benefit plan with a
voucher system because, infla-
tion occurs and the cost of living
increases, benefits will decrease
since they won't be adjusted for
inflationary measures.
Dingell said stability in the
financial sector is vital for
investment in the economy and
the United States is on the verge
of an economic boom.
"The U.S. is ready for a period

of economic greatness," he said.
"And the corporate treasuries
are bulging with money, but they
don't want to spend ... They want
to invest and make jobs because
they don't have any apprecia-
tion of the financial system we're
looking at, because until the bud-
get is finally decided, and they
have certainty - and business
needs certainty. If they get cer-
tainty, they'll invest."
Public Policy senior Mad-
elynne Wager, a member of
TCKB, said she thought Ding-
ell's perspective as the longest-
serving representative on the
national debt is vital for creating
a successful plan of action for the
future.
"So if we can understand his
experience, and the types of
issues he faces, we can then re-
orient our actions in the most
effective manner," Wager said.
Public Policy junior Matt
Andonian said he wanted to take
advantage of the unique oppor-
tunity to see Dingell, and agreed
that the budget is not practical
for the future.
"Obviously (the budget) isn't
sustainable. I think there's quite
a few things they need to really
look at."

Equal work, equal tuition
Regents should put the tuition equality debate behind them
n March 24, The Detroit News, a traditionally conservative
newspaper, published an editorial in support of the Univer-
sity's Coalition for Tuition Equality, a student-led umbrella
organization championing in-state tuition for undocumented stu-
dents. While the University has expressed a desire to grant tuition
equality for the estimated 21,000 affected students, practical reali-
ties and legal hurdles have caused progress to stagnate on such poli-
cies. In the editorial, The Detroit News pointed out universities in
13 other states extended in-state tuition to its undocumented stu-
dents. The University should do the same. With growing support
for tuition equality from faculty, students and community members,
the hesitation in implementing tuition equality at the University is

Obviously, I don't give a damn about

MICHAEL PROPPE AND BOBBY DISHELL
It's all about 'you'

no longer acceptable.
Current University policy charges undocu-
mented students out-of-state tuition. CTE
argues that undocumented students who've
lived in Michigan for the majority of their
lives and meet certain requirements deserve
to pay in-state tuition. In its editorial, The
Detroit News similarly contended that
regardless of one's position on immigration
policy, the children of undocumented work-
ers grew up in Michigan "involuntarily"
and shouldn't be punished for choices they
didn't make. Furthermore, The Detroit News
argued that "rather than driving these excel-
lent students underground, or out of state,"
keeping graduates in Michigan will help the
economy. To this end, CTE is proposing a pol-
icy in which undocumented students can gain
in-state tuition if they agree to attend a state
university for at least three years and plan to
stay in Michigan. Growing support from such
diverse media outlets for tuition equality is
indicative that this topic has become a larger
issue than just an internal affair of the Uni-
versity. More universities should be having
this conversation.
University President Mary Sue Coleman
earlier this month voiced her support for
tuition equality. "Iwould love to have the same
circumstances here, but we don't," she said in
reference to California state provisions, which
allow universities to grant in-state prices for
undocumented students. Although there may
be some complications in providing tuition
equality while complying with state law, the

University's status as a constitutionally auton-
omous state institution gives it the leeway to
move forward on the issue. In fact, other pub-
lic universities in Michigan - also constitu-
tionally autonomous - have proven that it's
not impossible. Wayne State University, West-
ern Michigan University and Saginaw Valley
State University have all found ways to offer
tuition equality to students while adhering to
the state laws. Implementing tuition equality
is plausible, and the University can't continue
to use legal complications to delay fair policy.
Last week, Oregon's state Senate passed
a bill calling for tuition equality, poising the
state to become the next to support undocu-
mented students. While the state senators
worked with college administrations across
the state, Oregon sets an example of state gov-
ernments taking responsibility on the issue.
Michigan lawmakers should look to the exam-
ple of Oregon, as well as other states such as
Texas and California, and become a role model
itself in advocating for student rights and
higher education.
Though the comprehensive of immigra-
tion reform must continue at local, state and
federal levels, the University needs to take
this as an opportunity to be a leader in pro-
moting tuition equity. Other state universi-
ties in Michigan have shown that it's legally
possible. The Board of Regents should review
the report on tuition equality, acting on the
right side of history and putting this issue in
the past.

This year, when you cast your
vote for Central Student Govern-
ment executives, you won't just
be casting your ballot for political
pleasantries or feel-good slogans.
Instead, you'll be choosing your
campus leaders for the upcoming
year - leaders who'll represent the
student body to our administration,
faculty, the campus community
and the outside world. It's impor-
tant to consider what each of the
candidates and parties will seek to
accomplish - and will reasonably
achieve - as a student government.
This year, youMICH is presenting a
platform full of tangible, achievable
goals that will positively impact the
lives of students on campus. From
creating an off-campus bus route
to developing an MCard app and
increasing student organization
funding, we want to make student
government all about the students
again - all about you.
Our presidential candidate, Busi-
ness and LSA junior Michael Proppe,
has served as CSG's speaker of
assembly for a year and is the presi-
dent of his business fraternity, Delta
Sigma Pi. LSA sophomore Bobby
Dishell, our vice presidential can-
didate, has served as an LSA repre-
sentative since November and is the
vice president of recruitment for the
Interfraternity Council Executive
Board. As CSG members and leaders
of student organizations, Proppe and
Dishell understand that CSG works
best when it works for the lives of the
students. We aim to help with your
student organizations, your campus
community and your academics.
Student organizations are the
lifeblood of this campus, and CSG
should do everything it can to aid
and empower them. If elected,

we promise to ensure that at least
50 percent of CSG's budget goes
straight back to student organiza-
tion funding via the Student Organi-
zation Funding Commission.
Our proposed off-campus bus
route is a smart solutionto a serious
problem. An off-campus bus route
servicing the Hill Street, South
University Avenue and Washtenaw
Avenue corridors, the State Street
and Packard Street area, and those
at Scorekeepers will provide stu-
dents with increased safety, reduce
wait times for SafeRide and create a
more sustainable campus environ-
ment by reducing emissions from
dozens of taxis.
We're working on an Mcard app
to eliminate the need to carry your
Mcard by incorporating it right onto
your smartphone. The Mcard is the
key to unlocking the campus com-
munity; it gets students into Greek
events, buildings, exams, sport-
ing and social events, dining halls
and so much more. Why not make
it a part of your smartphone and
eliminate the need to carry your
Mcard everywhere?
youMICH will also create a stu-
dent organization sorting hat survey
to help match incoming students
with groups on campus. At orienta-
tion, new students will be able to
indicate their passions, interests and
organizations they were involved in
during high school and types of orga-
nizations they'd liketo join in college.
Organizations can indicate what
types of profiles match what they're
looking for, and CSG will put new
students and organizations in touch
with each other.
Creating a 24-hour cafe in the
Duderstadt Center on North Cam-
pus is also a no-brainer, and you-

MICH is proud to have been first
to propose this idea in the election.
Since we've put this in our platform,
other parties have followed suit, and
we're flattered by their imitation.
The 24-hour cafe in the Shapiro
Undergraduate Library has been a
huge success and important part of
academic life on campus. Caffeine-
starved engineers and artists on
North Campus deserve the same
round-the-clock support that stu-
dents can enjoy on Central Campus.
Finally, CSG has done well in
supporting student entrepreneur-
ship this year, and we want to keep
that work going. We have proposed
creating a five-year combined bach-
elor's and master's in Entrepreneur-
ship program that will be housed in
a residence hall. This will give the
innovative and courageous students
a University-supported platform on
which to thrive.
There are 43,000 students at
Michigan, and it's time to have a
student government that listens to
their real concerns and addresses
tangible issues on campus. With
creative and innovative thinkers
responding to student concerns and
issues, CSG can become a proactive
environment for making academic
life and the campus environment all
about the students again. Michael
Proppe, Bobby Dishell and all of our
youMICH candidates will be ready
to hit the ground running on day
one, and we hope to have the oppor-
tunity to serve you. It's time to have
a student government that makes
student needs its first and foremost
priority - that's why youMICH is
all about you.

SCOTT CHRISTOPHER AND ETHAN MICHAELI
Hail to our peers

There are many talented individuals who
would like to serve as your next Central Stu-
dent Government leaders. In fact, we believe
that when it comes to values, character and the
desire to truly make a difference for University
students, those of us who are running for office
have more similarities than differences. We
view our opponents as worthy competitors, not
adversaries. We genuinely respect all who are
competingto lead CSG, representyourinterests
and give you a strong voice in student affairs.
We believe our differences are best illustrated
by vision and ideas, not through adversarial
engagement. Instead of "going negative," which
seems to be the easy path to distract from the
real issues in today's competitive world, it's
necessaryto generate healthy debate over mat-
ters of true importance. It's sad, really. We sim-
ply won't go there, and we hope it's an example
that all will follow. As your only independent
candidates for CSG president and vice presi-
dent, Scott Christopher and Ethan Michaeli,
respectively, are campaigning on ideas - a
full, independent platform of ideas with equal
importance on plans to get them cone.
We recognize and share many of our oppo-
nents' goals, and we also have some very criti-
cal objectives that are unique to our platform.
Reform of the University's Counseling and Psy-
chological Services, returning power back to
the student organizations and the safest cam-
pus are three key initiatives within our plat-
form. You can check out our entire platform on
our website.
However, everyone has great ideas about
moving forward for next year. We hail Mike
Proppe and Bobby Dishell of youMICH for

moving forward the student organization
sorting hat, a part of their platform that links
students to clubs of interest. It's definitely
somethingthatwe would've loved as freshmen.
momentUM's Nick Swider and Jill Clancy have
made huge strides reconnecting to students,
especially freshmen. It's always gratifying to
see Nick taking big steps during his firstyear on
campus. Chris Osborn and Hayley Sakwa from
forUM offer a progressive platform, touching
some key areas for the University's success.
Personally, we can't wait to have more fresh
and sustainable food on campus. Finally, the
Defend Affirmative Action Party is pushing for-
ward an important issue on campus. Its execu-
tive candidates realize that Michigan isn't as
diverse as it claims to be, and they're making
strides to bring a greater voice within CSG for
diverse and underrepresented students.
We want to salute and hail every one of our
peers in this election. We're thrilled to be com-
peting with such great individuals, and I hope
we can all work together next year. As we said
duringthe debate, we pledge to work with every
candidate no matter the result of this election -
because what we can do as two people is noth-
ing compared to what we can all do together.
As we move into this busy week, I encour-
age everyone to become informed on the great
candidates that are running, and, most impor-
tantly, to vote! This is the time that we truly
bring CSG back to each and every student as 10
dedicated candidates hoping to change the Uni-
versityfor the better.

Freshman forward Mitch McGary had a breakout game in the third round of the NCAA Tournament against Virginia Commonwealth, but he remains a team-first player.

COURTESY OF MCGARY FAMII
McGary has an odd set of talents off
the court, like riding a unicycle.

Mitch Mc Gary:
Michigan's'Giver'
by Steven Braid Daily Sports Editor

T he images of Mitch
McGary sliding along
the floor or diving into
the stands are entrenched in
the minds of many who have
watched the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team this year. McGary's
bigbody tangled in the crowd, his
massive arms waving in encour-
agement for the crowd to cheer
louder, his legs flailing every
which way - perhaps more than
anyone else, he embodies hustle.
But that all-out energy and
somewhat out-of-control play
is steeped in something much
deeper: a desire to be the best
teammate possible.
It's plenty clich4 for coaches
to praise their team and to call
attention to how good their play-
ers can be, but McGary is truly a
team player. All those dives and
bumps and bruises and burns are
for the team. McGary realizes
that he's become a fan favorite,
that he can create an atmospher-
ic buzz in Crisler Center with his
antics, but he also realizes, more
than anything, that his frenzied
play has a bigger impact on his
teammates.
"I always like to say, 'Be a giver
and not a drainer,"' he says.
I sn the age of high-profile
recruits being groomed
from their middle-school or
early high-school days, McGary
differs in that he has always had
interests away from the court.
Wayne Brumm, McGary's
AAU coach, said he's heard sto-
ries about the Chesterton, Ind.
native throwing a baseball in the
mid-to-high 80s, and Brumm
once or twice talked McGary out
of playing the sport beyond high
school by asking, "How many
6-(foot)-10 outfielders are there
in the majors?"
His high school football coach
wanted to put his name out on
the recruiting trail after his
freshman season playing at the
junior-varsity level at Chesterton
High School because he just had
a sense that McGary would get
recruited to play football in col-
lege.
McGary is also an avid skate-
boarder. His dad built him ramps
in the driveway behind his house,
a place where he and his friends
could hone their skills. But noth-
ing stands out to his family more
than what he could do on one
wheel, on a unicycle.

"He was so good at what-
ever he did, it was incredible,"
McGary's older brother Ryan
said. "So I bought him a unicycle
for his 12th birthday, and he mas-
tered it in like a week."
When he's at home, McGary
will periodically tell his dad to
toss him footballs while he's rid-
ing around on his unicycle. He's
got so much control on one wheel
that Brumm thinks he should
lead the team out of the tunnel
before each game on the unicycle.
McGary wasn't the only kid
in the community with a unicy-
cle. His friend Spencer had one
too. McGary always wanted his
own paper route, but his parents
wouldn't allow him to pick up the
job because of his many other
responsibilities.
He always liked working as
a team, helping others, so he
offered to help Spencer with his
paper route. Side by side, the two
would deliver newspapers to
doorsteps together, each riding
their own unicycle.
"You should have seen them
wobble down the street togeth-
er," said his father, Tim. "It was
such a funny sight."
To Tom Peller, McGary's
former coach at Ches-
terton High School,
nothing epitomizes McGary's
competitive spirit more than the
big man's last game during his
sophomore year. He recounts the
game in a mix of awe and amaze-
ment.
In a game against Valparaiso
High School in the 4A region-
al quarterfinal, McGary was
injured early in the second quar-
ter. He had stolen a pass, sped
down the court and gone up for a
layup. He made the layup but was
undercut and fell down violently.
He crashed hard on his left wrist
and banged his head. McGary
headed to the bench to remain
there for the rest of the first half.
"I don't really remember much
from the game, but I do remem-
ber a funny story," McGary said.
"Two of my good friends, Juan
and Adam, they were sitting on
the bench next to me, and I kept
asking them if I made the basket,
literally around 15 times. They
kept answering me, but I didn't
really comprehend them until
afterwards."
At halftime, McGary wanted
to go back into the game. It was

a playoff game, and playing while
injured was instinctive to him,
a no-brainer. If he was able to
contribute, then he would play.
The team's trainer made him do
jumping jacks and assessed that
he was healthy enough to go
back into the game. McGary's left
wrist hurt, but that didn't matter.
He got his wrist taped, and he re-
entered the game after halftime,
finishing out the rest of the dou-
ble-overtime contest.
Only later was it figured out
that McGary's injuries were a
little more severe than previously
thought.
"We found out afterwards that
he had a concussion and a broken
wrist," Peller said. "He wound up
playing the rest of the game, and
he played great. That was one of
his better games, he had like 18
points and 12 boards. That was
kind of amazing."
Brewster Academy basket-
ball coach Jason Smith
has had many play-
ers come through his program
during his 13 years at the New
Hampshire prep school. He has
coached five NBA players, and
out of the seven players who
graduated in 2012 to go on to play
Division I basketball, five have
collected Rookie of the Week
honors in their respective con-
ferences.
But, according to Smith, in his
two years coaching him, McGary
was a little bit different than all
the other highly touted players
that passed through. He made
time for everyone, whether it was
students in the hallways, workers
in the dining hall, members of the
maintenance staff, something
Smith considers rare for a bas-
ketball player - and a teenager in
general.
What former Brewster team-
mate and current UCLA guard
Khalid McCaskill remembers
most about McGary was the pride
he took in being the hustle player,
in doing whatever little thing he
could to help the team.
But maybe Smith's favorite
story about McGary is one that
he never witnessed firsthand.
During the 2011 summer, right
before his final year at Brewster
and about the time his stock was
starting to spike, McGary attend-
ed the NBA Top-100 Camp at the
University of Virginia.
It's an accepted standard at

these camps that players are just
trying to improve their stock and
will try to make themselves look
as good as possible on the court.
Smith expected there to be some
buzz about McGary's play, as this
would be an opportunity for him
to showcase his talents for an
audience that included dozens
of college coaches. One day dur-
ing the camp, Smith had gone for
a run, and when he came back
his phone was blowing up. But it
wasn't about what he had expect-
ed.
"I had about 15 text messages
from coaches and they were all
talking about how shocked they
were because they had never
seen anyone with a reputation
like Mitch's be such a great team-
mate at a camp setting," Smith
said. "The text messages were
saying that he was giving his
teammates water during time-
outs, he was the first guy clap-
ping on the bench and that he
cheering his teammates on - and
this was all happening at a com-
petitive camp."
It came as no surprise to
Smith. That selflessness was
something he saw from McGary
on a daily basis, whether it was
during a game or a practice.
"The one thing you can say
about Mitch is that he always has
been, and he always will be, atre-
mendous teammate," Smith said.
"With him, it's not about person-
al accolades. It's all about what he
can do to help the team win. He's
definitely the best teammate of
anyone that we have had."
cGary has a competi-
tive spirit, and there's
no question that he's
wanted to start every game this
season. He came in as a blue-chip
recruit, one of the nation's best
big men, and there was a lot of
pressure on him. Even if he won't
say it, there were expectations
that he wanted to meet.
Early in the season, McGary
accepted the sixth-man role. He
was a difference maker off the
bench, providing energy and
pumping up the crowd with his
hustle.
So when redshirt junior for-
ward Jordan Morgan went down
with a sprained ankle in late
January, McGary had his oppor-
tunity to start. It was something
he had been waiting for all sea-
son, and now all he had to do was

accept the promotion while Mor-
gan was unable to compete on a
bum ankle.
But McGary didn't do what
was expected. On Jan. 29, the
night before the Wolverines
matched up against Northwest-
ern, McGary suggested to Michi-
gan coach John Beilein that he
look elsewhere to fill the void in
the starting lineup that Morgan
left.
"I said to Mitch McGary,
'Mitch, what do you feel about
tomorrow? I don't know what to
do yet, you (and redshirt sopho-
more Jon Horford) both prac-
ticed well,' " Beilein said. "He
said, 'Coach, I've been coming off
the bench for two years, I'm cool
with coming off the bench.' That
really helped us make the deci-
sion. Talk about sacrifice."
For McGary, there's nowor-
rying about his future, no
concern over his stats or
his minutes. He started the sea-
son coming off the bench and
only recently has made his way
into the starting lineup. He pro-
vides what the team needs - no

kicked Gov. Rick Snyder in the
face when diving for a ball in the
stands.
McGary's unselfish style of play
doesn't really stand out until you
realize that he was the second-
highest-rated high-school recruit
in the country when he commit-
ted to Michigan in the fall of 2011.
"I started at the bottom of
the totem pole, and I'm trying to
make my way up," McGary said.
"I never wanted to diss anybody,
I've always wanted to be a giver.
I keep saying that because it's
important in life to give to peo-
ple."
And as the season winds down
and the Wolverines make a push
in the postseason, McGary is giv-
ing more than ever. He's averag-
ing 17 points and 11.5 rebounds
in the NCAA Tournament so far
and tallied career highs in points,
rebounds and minutes in Michi-
gan's third-round victory against
Virginia Commonwealth.
But for McGary, he's trying
to save his best for last, working
hard to accomplish what he set
outto do when he signedhisletter

Freshman second baseman Jacob Cronenworth stayed hot Wednesday, hitting two doubles with an RBI in the loss.

with one out. Sexton then hit a
deep sacrifice fly to the center
fielder that allowed Winger to
tag up and score. Zott, tagging
up on second, tried to round
third and score on the play, but
a perfect relay got him thrown
out.
Michigan added another run
inthe third when junior outfield-
er Michael O'Neill laced a ball up
the middle to start off the inning,
followed by a stolen base. This
allowed freshman second base-
man Jacob Cronenworth to come
to the plate with a runner in
scoring position, an opportunity
that he didn't waste as he drove

in O'Neill with an opposite-field
double, his fifth of the year.
"I was just hitting the pitches
that they threw to me," Cronen-
worth said. "I guess I'm just see-
ing the ball well, but we have to
put the whole game together."
Michigan threatened in the
eighth inning when O'Neill
led off with a double and came
around to score off of sophomore
catcher Kevin White's single.
The Wolverines had runners on
first and second with only one
out, but a strikeout and a run-
ner thrown out on the bases cost
Michigan the rally.
A factor in the game was the

strong wind blowing into the
hitters' faces, and it held up sev-
eral fly balls for outs rather than
finding gaps for extra-base hits.
Two bright spots for the Wol-
verines continue to be the play
of O'Neill and Cronenworth.
O'Neil continued his strong start
by scoring two runs, hitting a
two-hop double to the fence and
stealing a base to up his total to
nine on the year. Cronenworth
also continues to swing a hot bat
after hitting two doubles while
recording an RBI.

As a brisk wind blew into right
field, fans and coaches huddled
under multiple layers of clothing
when the No.14 Michigan softball
team hosted Bowling Green on
Wednesday afternoon. But junior
left fielder Nicole Sappingfield
sparked an offense that was red
hot, and the Wolverines buried
the Falcons, 9-1.
Last season, Sappingfield was
instrumen-
tal in the BGSU 1
Wolverines' MICHIGAN 9
12-2 victory
over the Falcons, driving in five
runs on two hits. On Wednesday,
she again impressed at the plate,
leading rallies in the first two
innings to stretch Michigan's lead
to eight. The Wolverines (3-0 Big
Ten, 25-7 overall) have won seven
consecutive games, the longest
streak of the young season.
"We just like to play hard," Sap-
pingfield said. "It's always nice to
be on the field - it's better than
practice."
The Wolverines wasted no time
breaking the game open, sand-
wiching a pair of hits - the first
by Sappingfield - between walks
to bring home a quick run in the
opening frame. After a patient
at-bat that forced Falcons pitcher
Paris Imholz to throw strikes,
freshman designated hitter Sierra
Lawrence laced a shot into cen-
ter field. First baseman Kelsey
Susalla followed with a pop fly
that dropped into right field, and
senior right fielder Jaclyn Crum-
mey added a blooper that squibbed
out of the infield, extending Mich-.
igan's lead to six.
Sappingfield's sharp single to
left field in the second inning led
to a two-run frame that pushed
the lead to eight. The teams
exchanged scores in the fourth
inning before the game was decid-
ed by mercy rule.
Michigan has dominated the
all-time series against Bowling
Green, 30-5, and has won nine
consecutive games against the
Falcons.
Sophomore pitcher Haylie
Wagner struggled in the opening
frame, hitting shortstop/Iannah
Fulk in the helmet witK a fastball
on the first pitch of the game. But
after another runtner reached on a
dropped thirdtrike, the 2012 Big
Ten Pitcher of the Year induced a
groundout to escape the inning.
Though she was disappointed by
the early miscues, Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins explained that the
weekday games help the Wolver-
ines improve for weekend series.
"Our goal is to keep sharp,"
Hutchins said. "We're just trying
to get in a groove."
Wagner did just that, mixing
off-speed pitches with a power-
ful fastball to hold the Falcons to
only one hit through three innings
of work.
Sophomore Sara Driesenga
took over pitching duties in the
fourth inning for the Wolverines
and was immediately hit in the
left arm by a comeback line drive.
After a short delay, the right-
hander stayed in the circle for the
last two innings - allowing a run
on two hits - but ended the game
with her third strikeout. Hutchins
said she's "hopeful" that Driesen-
gawill pitch this weekend.
A strong wind was blowing
out to right field throughout the
contest, making routine pop-ups
difficult for the outfielders. The
breeze might have helped Michi-

gan in the first inning when Bowl-
ing Green center fielder misread a
Lawrence line drive. The Wolver-
ines added 10 hits to the error and
put a runner on base on all but one
inning, decisively halting Bowling
Green's four-game win streak.
"I thought we did a good job
of playing the game and not play-
ing the opponent," Hutchins said.
"We got on a bit of an offensive
groove over the weekend and we
want to keep it."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
New coach, old players propeled
Wolverines to historic season

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Jon Merrill dazzled in his freshman year, but a suspension and an injury short-
ened his next two seasons. Michigan announced his departure Wednesday.
M errl forgoes
senior season

Junior defenseman
signs contract with
Devils; Trouba
decision to come
BY MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
After three seasons with the
Michigan hockey team, including
two shortened ones, defenseman
Jon Merrill has left the Univer-
sity and signed an amateur tryout
contract with the Albany Devils
of the American Hockey League,
according to TSN's Bob McK-
enzie on Twitter. The Michigan
hockey team later reported the
news on Twitter.
Merrill also signed an entry-
level agreement with the New
Jersey Devils, the parent club
of Albany, set to begin with the

2013-14 season.
In his final year as a Wolverine,
which came to an end Sunday in
a 3-1 loss to Notre Dame in the
CCHA championship game, Mer-
rill tallied two goals and nine
assists in 21 games. He missed
the first half of the season with
a fractured vertebrae suffered in
an exhibition game against the
University of Windsor on Oct. 9.
Merrill also missed the first
half of his sophomore season
because of a suspension for an
undisclosed violation of team
rules.
At his end-of-season press con-
ference Tuesday, Michigan coach
Red Berenson said he expected
Merrill to depart.
"I'm leaning towards it's going
to be time for Jonny to move,"
Berenson said. "I think (the Dev-
ils) have been really patient. They
could have signed him after his
first year."

It has been a hell of a season
for the Michigan women's bas-
ketball team.
The Wolverines exceeded all
expectations under first-year
coach Kim Barnes Arico. Michi-
gan (9-7 Big Ten, 22-11 overall)
got off
to a 16-2
start - ALEXA
best in DETTELBACH
program On Women's
history Basketball
- during
which
time the Wolverines went on a
10-game winning streak, setting
another program record.
Once Big Ten play started,
Michigan set yet another pro-
gram record by winning its
first four games. Adding to the
accolades, Barnes Arico led the
Wolverines to a win over No. 13
Purdue in early February, and
later ended a six-year drought
against Michigan State in a close
70-69 win that ended in dramatic
fashion at Crisler Center on Feb.
16.
And if that weren't enough,
Michigan earned its first Associ-
ated Press ranking since 2002 on
Jan. 14 and won its first NCAA
Tournament game since 2001.
Thisteamreached newheights
fans would never have guessed,
especially after an offseason that
cost the Wolverines five players
to ACL injuries.
"When you get a coaching
change, you don't know what to
expect," said senior guard Jenny
Ryan. "I can't explain enough

throw her style at us, she worked
with us, got to know us as people,
as players and once you realize
the amount of effort that was put
in, I'm not surprised by our suc-
cess."
Barnes Arico has pointed to
her seniors all season as the rea-
son for the team's success, and
rightfully so. The five seniors,
four of whom started, account
for 84 percent of the offense. The
80 wins make this class the win-
ningest in school history.
Led by Ryan, Michigan never
lacked leadership. Ryan earned
third-team All-Big Ten honors,
the first time she's been named
to an all-conference team, and

was her 3-point shooting that
carried her. She set the program
record for most career 3-pointers
as well as 3-pointers in a season.
She ended the season with 110,
becoming only the fifth player in
Big Ten history to hit at least 100
threes in a season.
Thompson garnered second-
team All-Big Ten honors and
also finished the regular season
ranked second in the nation in
3-pointers per game with 3.4. In
Michigan's second-round NCAA
Tournament loss to Stanford,
Thompson scored just seven
points, but it still brought her
past the 1,000-point mark for her
career.

ended up averaging 8.5 points
per game, while leading the team
it rebounds with 7.5 per game.
The Detroit native also earned
an honorable mention from the
Big Ten.
As the only senior who didn't
start, forward Sam Arnold made
sure her presence was known
when she entered off the bench.
Arnold averaged 5.2 points per
game and led the team in field-
goal percentage, hitting 53.2 per-
cent of her shots. She was by far
the most productive bench player
for the Wolverines, who spent
most of their time in a six-player
rotation.
With a Michigan team so
dependent on its seniors, Barnes
Arico's squad will be starting
over next year, allowing her
to put her stamp on the team.
Retaining only one starter, soph-
omore forward Nicole Elmblad,
Barnes Arico will need help from
her incoming freshmert class as
well as huge contributions from
freshman guard Madison Ris-
tovski. Ristovski was expected to
play a major role this season, but
the success of the seniors put her
on the bench.
"Any time you don't win a
national championship, you're
going to end your season on a.
sour note," Barnes Arico said.
"They're a special group, and we
talked about it all week. I feel
honored to be their coach, and*
the transition has been so great."
Despite an early exit from the
NCAA Tournament, the Wol-
verines' accomplishments went
eyond expectations. It was clear
from the opener against Detroit
- back on Nov. 9 - this had the
potential to be a season worth
remembering.
And it was.

averaged 10.2 points per game
with 5.2 assists. A leader on and
off the court as the point guard
and captain, Ryan embraced her
vocal role and became the heart
and soul of the team from the
beginning.
"I've coached a lot of really
good point guards in my career
as a coach, and she leads the pack
just because of everything she
does," Barnes Arico said. "She's
the total package. She's a coach's
dream really."
The surprise 'x'-factor for this
Wolverine squad was forward
Kate Thompson - who had never
started a game until this season.
Thompson led the team in points,
averaging 14.5 per game, but it

Center Rachel Sheffer, who
led the team in points last sea-
son, averaged 12.8 points and 6.6
rebounds per game this season.
Sheffer proved to be a critical
player for a team that typically
ran three- or four-guard sets,
earning an honorable mention
from the Big Ten. Her experience
and poise set her apart from the
start in the locker room. On Jan.
21, Sheffer scored her 1,000th
career point.
Another pleasant surprise
from the seniors was forward
Nya Jordan, who worked her
way into the starting lineup once
conference play began. Jordan,
whose specialty had always been
defense, worked on her shot and

Recreating Panera s
holiday bread

baked.buzzed.bored.
In this new series, three daily arts writers
in varying states of mind visit the same
place and write about their experiences.
this week's destination:
"S pring Breakers "

There are a few things
that draw me back
home at least a couple
of times every semester, name-
ly my family and friends, a .
cozy bed and
an actual
kitchen:
You know,
that magical
place where
you can cook
or bake with
more than NATHAN
just a micro- WOOD
wave and
cup of Easy
Mac (#RAproblems). And while
I was home this past weekend,
I tried my hand at something
I've been wanting to taste for a
long time: Panera Bread's Holi-
day Bread.
All November and Decem-
ber, I walked past Panera on
North U and stared at the
window-sized photos of the
bread being offered "for a lim-
ited time only." On a weathered
wooden cutting board laid a
sliced loaf of brioche oozing
with apple filling and topped
with streusel and icing. Cran-
berries were dashed about and
a cup of coffee - artfully set
out of focus - sat alongside. I
could taste Christmas in my
mouth just looking at it.

"4 large eggs, lightly beaten
-1/4 cup honey
.3/4 cup unsalted butter,
melted (11/2 sticks)
"4 cups all-purpose flour
.1/2 cup semisweet choco-
late chips
.1/2 cup chopped walnuts
"1/4 cup dried cranberries
.1/4 cup golden raisins
Directions:
1. Mix the water, yeast, salt,
eggs and honey in a large bowl.
Slowly add the melted butter
while stirring vigorously so as
to not scramble the eggs and/or
kill the yeast.
2. Mix in all of the flour
(without kneading) - lumps
are okay.
3. Allow the dough to rise
with a non-airtight lid until it
begins to collapse (about three
hours). A warm, moist place is
best. If your oven has a proof-
ing setting, use it. If not, don't
worry. Either way, place a big
bowl of hot water in the bot-
tom of the oven to supply the
moisture.
4. Punch down the dough
with greased hands.
5. Transfer the dough to
a floured cutting board and
briefly knead in the remaining
ingredients.
Apple-Cinnamon Filling

Simple Egg Wash
Ingredients:
-1 large egg
-1 tablespoon water
Directions:
1.Whisk to combine.
Streusel Topping
Ingredients:
-1/2 cup granulated sugar
-1/4 cup unsalted butter,
room temperature
-1/2 teaspoon ground cin-
namon
-1/3 cup all-purpose flour
Directions:
1. Combine all of the ingre-
dients in a small bowl.
2. Mix with a fork until
crumbly.
Powdered Sugar Icing
Ingredients:
-2 cups powdered sugar
(sifted, if you can)
-1/2 teaspoon vanilla
-Approximately 3 table-
spoons milk
Directions:
1. Mix together the pow-
dered sugar, vanilla and one
tablespoon of milk.
2. Continue adding milk -
one teaspoon at a time - until
the desired consistency is
achieved.
BAKING:
1. Roll the brioche dough into
a rectangle approximately 1/2-
inch thick.
2. Spread the apple-cinnamon
filling over the middle third of
the dough rectangle, starting at
one short end and ending at the
other.
3. Fold over the longsides of
the rectangle so that the filling is
covered and there is some dough
overlap in the middle.
4. Transfer the loaf to a flat
baking sheet and let it rest for an
hour and 40 minutes.
5. Brush the top with egg
wash (don't be concerned with
using it all).
6. Scatter the streusel topping
over the whole loaf (definitely
use it all).
7. Bake the bread at 325
degrees for approximately
one hour, or until a toothpick
inserted under the streusel crust
comes out clean.
8. Cool the bread slightly.
9. Drizzle the icing over the
streusel. Slice the bread and
serve warm.

The stakes have never been higher.
Ashley Benson, Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez and Fourth Girl
(who IS that fourth girl) just want to go on spring break ("spraaaaaang
breaaaaaak"), but they have no drug money or booze money or scooter
money or bikini money :(. So, they pick up some hammers and squirt
guns and turn into robbers (not Selena though - she's innocent! She's
religious! Amen!). THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER.
Picture this: A corn-rowed, grillz-studded James Franco tapping a
single key on his white piano, hands bloodied, cooing "I'm gonna kill
my beeeest friend." His BFF, for the record, is Gucci Mane.
Meanwhile: Boobs. Literally everywhere. The stakes, the stakes.
An extended criminal endeavor montage is scored - horribly, per-
fectly - by Britney Spears's "Everytime." You'll laugh; you'll cry; you
might see through time and space (I did all three).
What is "Spring Breakers" about? Nothing. And yet, everything.
Never before have I been so disturbed that my only reaction was to
laugh and laugh and laugh and drop all of my popcorn because. I. Can't.
Stop. Laughing. "Shhhh," say fellow moviegoers, who apparently are
takingthis all much more seriously than I am.
The longest threesome ever in the history of cinema happens. It's
more confusing than sexy (the film's logline).
For most of the movie, I'm torn between wanting to make a list of
every overtly male-gazey shot, wanting to leave the theater to go get
chicken tenders and wantingto take body shots off of Vanessa Hudgens.
Don't see this movie sober. You will hate yourself.
In the (probably paraphrased) words of T.M.: "I feel kind of down.
It's like real life isn't enough. I'm gonna go sleep on this."
- DAILY ARTS WRITER
"Spring Breakers" is the best movie I've seen in forever and I can't
feel my face. All of a sudden I understand Dubstep, and Rustie is better
than he's ever been. Slasherr. James Franco is Riff Raff, wearing silver
grillz. Aliens. So here's the deal ...
My two best friends arrived in Ann Arbor unexpectedly on Saturday.
I was supposed to see "Spring Breakers" then, but after six hours and
eight craft beers at Ashley's and two bottles of wine at a house party, I
didn't feel very up to the prospect of sitting in a theater. I skipped the
show. Sacrificed the later for the now. #SpringBreakBitches. Now it's
Monday night and I need to see this crazy movie drunk out of my mind.
I hope future employers don't read this.
Class gets out at 9:00. Two shots of Mango Burnett's, two of Sailor's,
Jameson and a Honey Wheat beer. Lez go. Hit the 9:45 show. Leather
flask of 100% Agave just for kicks. After all, it's spring break (right?).
No, it's Monday (night).
My D.D. hero Brian K. drives me to the theater (D.T. tags along -
after some shots of gin). In line at the theater, D.T. whispers, "Is that
Tim Hardaway behind us?" I turn around - HOLY SHIT IT IS. Be cool.
We want to whisper "Good luck against KU; kick that Whitney bro's
ass" but we restrain ourselves. Whitney is there as well. They are see-
ing some movie that starts with an "O. " Could it be "Olympus is Fall-
ing?" I don't know; I'm beyond reading things.
Neon tits everywhere. That's the plot summary of "Spring Break-
ers." Harmony has made something wonderfully dark, something that
is right next to and so far away from everything that is the American
Youth. Skrillex. Guns. Gucci Mane. Bikinis. I need to go to sleep. Hope-
fully I won't have glow-in-the-dark nightmares. #InMitchMcGaryWe-
Trust #BeatKU
- MATT EASTON
OK, so watching "Spring Breakers" while totally, stupidly sober goes
like this: It's like being part of a "Harlem Shake" video, only you're at
the way back, no one can see you and you sort of awkwardly stand there,
waving at the camera. And the whole time, the weird guy up front in a
neon bikini keeps seductively whispering "spring break forever, bitches."
The crisis started happening midway through the movie. Right about
when Faith finally leaves (let's face it, she wasn't ready for spring break
lyfe), I asked myself what I was watching ... and had no answers. There's
really no plot other than getting wasted, grinding on bitches, boobs, kill-
ing bitches, boobs - and while the girls took on their roles eagerly, I was
like, "Say 'spring break' again. Say it."
I want to love it. And a part of me does - the weird part that watches
hours of music videos on end. But this is not life. This is nothing like my
spring break! I don't even own a neon bikini - should I be allowed to
live? I'm so far away from the spring breakers that I felt uncool watching
it. I felt as if Faith's grandma came along on the trip, and that grandma
was me.
But, yes. OK. It's going to be one of those movies I download and watch
at midnight on a Wednesday, pretending I too can drive off in a Lambo
after killing a drug kingpin.

NOIRE
From Page 1A
Anchored in the black
community
"It was two women who were
interested in creating something
that was serious about fashion, but
also centered in the black commu-
nity," said NOiR's vice president
Ciarra Ross, an LSA sophomore.
"They wanted something differ-
ent, something of higher quality
to represent the fashion industry."
Though NOiR has matured and
carved its own space among the
many student groups at the Uni-
versity, Ross said the original mis-
sion is still very much a part of the
organization.
"Now we're here and wanting
to encapsulate it, but also broaden
it a bit, always wanting to be more
diverse but to be anchored in the
black community, knowing that
that is what the vision was for it to
begin with."
Despite having close ties with
the African American commu-
nity, NOiR is a large advocate of
diversity and multi-culturalism.
"We have premier fashion in
our organization, and we are very
diverse," Thomas said. "You can
just look at our e-board."
Like many fashion groups on
campus, NOiR's style is distinct.
Rather than blending in with the
trends, NOiR highlights them
with clothing and accessory piec-
es chosen from both local design-
ers and big-name brands.
"We find (designers) on differ-
ent social networks like Twitter
and Instagram, and we're like,
'oh they have really cool stuff.' I
reached out to this guy from Okla-
homa, and he's donating wooden
bow ties this year," said Lou Pope,
Engineering senior and VIP coor-
dinator. "We are cognizant of the
different trends that are going on,
things that we want to show in
the show, but we also know who is
credible and who has good pieces
to represent."
In order to sponsor the show,
the non-profit student group
needs to spend a number of hours
reaching out to companies and
organizations, asking them to
help fund the show. Each e-board
member has a specific sector of
companies they contact, further-
ing the sponsorship relationships
along.
"The basis is gathering
resources, but where we gather
our resources from is all over the
place," Pope said. "Every execu-
tive board member has a role
or a specific sector that they're

NOiR's annual fashion show sponsors an organization of their choosing, with this year's pick being Food Gatherers.

reaching out to bring in those
resources.
"Within the organization, there
are a lot of different dynamics and
pvenues that you can support. My
specific job is to coordinate the
experience our VIP will have and
when our models are coming on to
audition."
An outlet for creativity
NOiR models go through a
week-long casting process at the
beginning of December. Each
model comes in with contact
information and measurements in
order for the e-board to compile
the candidates' information and
be ready when the final selections
are made.
"People come in and we have a
sheet that says, 'confidence level,'
'eye contact,' things like that -
things we normally look for,"
Ross explained. "And then we rate
based on different categories, and
we have numbers, so at the end,
whatever your total is puts you
into whether or not you made it."
Though casting might seem
competitive and judgmental,
HoJeong Shin, Music, Theatre
& Dance freshman and NOiR's
fashion recruit, assures that the
models chosen aren't stereotypi-

cal cover girls and are selected
based on personality and presen-
tation rather than looks alone.
"Because our organization is
about diversity, we look for mod-
els that are diverse. We don't
look for the typical skinny, tall
girls. We go from small, petite
girls, to tall girls, to plus-sized
models and models from all
backgrounds and races, so we
look for that, too."
The girls and guys chosen to
walk at the annual spring show
are revealed at a party thrown in
order to raise money for NOiR's
cause and also to celebrate the
models.
"That helps us out, supporting
our cause, making sure everyone
is present," Ross said.
The different opportunities
presented in NOiR all stem from
their cohesive mission: to give
back to the community with a
fashionable touch. Sundai John-
son, model coordinator and LSA
sophomore, noted that the trade
doesn't matter as long as service is
a part of the mission.
"In whatever we're doing,
regardless of what industry it is,
it's important to give back," John-
son said.
In this way, NOiR is able to con-
tinue as a non-profit group, help-

ing the community and providing
an outlet for creative individuals.
Preaching the acceptance of oth-
ers and community service, NOiR
prides itself in continuing its tra-
dition of producing quality shows
with a purpose.
"Putting a face to some of these
causes and letting people know
that you can do something really
fun and exciting and participate
in fashion, but you can also have
something behind it," Johnson
said. "That fashion doesn't have
to be a place where you have to
look a certain way or be a certain
way, and knowing as an organiza-
tion we offer that space for people
to express themselves without
the limitations and restraints the
fashion industry can put on you
sometimes."
This year's show, "La Nuit,"
premiers March 30 at the Union.
Though the contents and theme of
the show are kept secret until the
last minute, tickets typically sell
out quickly as the shows draw a
large crowd and noticeable atten-
tion.
Despite its direct, meaningful
motto and mission, one aspect of
NOiR can be confusing.
"'Noir' is French for black,"
Thomas said. "A lot of people
don't know that."

When the Occupy
movement broke out
in September 2011,1
didn't have anythingto say. Con-
versation in the dining hall would
sometimes
break out into
a discussion
of the move-
ment, but
I never felt
comfortable
with my opin-
ions. I ate J
my food and JOHN
listened to BOHN
others speak.
When the
world seemed to be shaking, and
you could hear the people's voices
screaming through the articles
on Occupy, and you could see the
meetings in our own town, there
was an imperative to brush up on
your politics and do you home-
work if you hadn't already. When
the gadflies swarmed the pro-
tests and asked the famous ques-
tion, "What do you demand?" I
didn't want to be the one who
didn't have a response, who gave
the movement a bad rap as being
romantic or naive. "We want
equality!" some would say. And
the skeptics responded: "Great,
how?"
Nowadays, if you ever talk to
someone who participated in the
Occupy movement, they'll laugh
in a defeated way, shake their
head and say, "we failed." In his
keynote address to the retirement
symposium of University profes-
sor Alan Wald that took place last
week, British-Pakistani activist
and writer Tariq Ali chose to dis-
cuss the poetry of defeat, a rather
dour topic he apologized for in
advance. From John Milton to
Nazim Hikmet, Ali looked at the
works of literature that had been
written in the wake of political
defeat. As a former Trotskyist,
vocal against Pakistan's military
dictatorship and adamant in
organizing protests in London
against the Vietnam War, Tariq
Ali's lecture seemed to be a
chance for him to come to terms
with his own sense of defeat. But
I didn't leave the lecture a newly
born pessimist.
In many ways, we inherit
the defeat of our mothers and
fathers, but we also inherit their
endless energy. I had never been
so moved by a public lecture as I
had by Tariq Ali's. He measured
his words and spoke with sin-
cerity, a quiet anger rumbling

beneath the surface. For all the
charges of idealism that get
thrown in the face of revolu-
tionaries, he spoke with a sober
realism. And might I add with a
bit of wit? Ironic humor and keen
delivery filled the event.
When Michael Lowy, a Brazil-
ian and French scholar of the rev-
olutionary imaginary, introduced
Tariq Ali, he chose to read from
Tariq Ali's Wikipedia page, mak-
ing personal commentary and
(in his mind) corrections as he
went. He arrived at the publica-
tion of Ali's novel "Redemption,"
a critical and satirical book about
the major figures of the Trotsky-
ist party trying to come to terms
with the fall of the Eastern Bloc.
Lowy, who was the inspiration
for one of the characters, called
Ali's depiction of him one of ten-
der irony. To which Ali respond-
ed that if tender irony was how
Lowy had read it, then he gravely
misread the book. Everyone
laughed, and with that, Ali began
his lecture.
Protests come
and go, but
communities
last forever.
Professor Wald, whose career
had been dedicated to document-
ing the many lives of the Ameri-
can literaryleft, remarked that
people always asked him how to
write a good political novel. He
said he tells them that in order to
do so, you write a good novel, and
then change all the names to ref-
erences of political figures. Voila!
These small asides gave the
symposium a sense of a living,
breathing community. Many
of these people shared not just
a common struggle but also a
personal history. They read
each other's work, sometimes
met at various nodes of resis-
tance or simply had dinner
together.
In the wake of defeat, what
do we have left? Other than the
resolve to continue and endure,
we have community and that
too must endure.
