While 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan has canceled classes 

in response to the COVID-19 

virus and advised students to 

leave campus if they are able, 

some 
organizations 
and 
local 

restaurants have continued food 

distribution at no cost to help 

those in the community facing 

food insecurity.

Food 
banks 
such 
as 
the 

University’s 
Maize 
and 
Blue 

Cupboard 
and 
Washtenaw 

County’s 
Food 
Gatherers 
are 

continuing their services during 

the coming weeks to assure that 

no one in the community will go 

hungry. 

Helen 
Starman, 
chief 

development 
officer 
of 
Food 

Gatherers, 
said 
many 
people 

will be feeling the effects of food 

insecurity for the very first time 

due to layoffs spurred by COVID-

19. Starman said Food Gatherers is 

providing meals to these people, as 

well as others who have benefited 

from their organization in the 

past.

“There are going to be people in 

this community who have never 

needed it before who are going to 

find that they need food,” Starman 

said. “We are open, we will stay 

open and we are here to provide 

food to anyone who needs it.”

Starman said Food Gatherers 

recognizes the risk that public 

school shutdowns in Washtenaw 

County pose to children on free 

or reduced meals. To alleviate the 

burden on families, Starman said 

the non-profit has set up locations 

in the community for families to 

collect two pre-made meals a day 

per child under the age of 18. 

This not only goes for children 

who are registered for reduced 

or free meals at school but for 

any child enrolled in the county 

public school system under 18. 

Additionally, 
any 
individual 

enrolled 
in 
special 
education 

programs 
through 
the 
public 

school system may collect their 

two meals a day if they are 26 or 

younger.

Starman said the food bank 

acquires the food by coordinating 

with school systems and then 

distributing the food to the people 

who need it.

“What’s 
happening 
right 

now in this sort of emergency 

situation is that each school 

district in Washtenaw County 

is taking the lead in providing 

meals to their kids, and those 

meals are being paid for by 

the Michigan Department of 

Education,” Starman said. “The 

MDE has now said, ‘You can 

give meals to anybody. You don’t 

have to check the kids at the door 

and provide information about 

needing reduced priced or free 

meals.’ So, our role in that is 

coordinating and helping people 

know where to get the food and 

how to pick it up.”

Starman 
also 
said 
the 

organization recognizes some 

families 
cannot 
access 
the 

facilities during the hours that 

Food Gatherers is open so they 

are trying to be flexible and cater 

to the community’s needs.

Arthur Tarnow, U.S. district 

court 
judge, 
deemed 
the 

University of Michigan’s former 

sexual 
misconduct 
policy 

unconstitutional on Monday. 

The lawsuit, Doe v. University 

of Michigan, was filed in June 

2018. The plaintiff, John Doe, 

a male undergraduate student 

was accused of sexual assault by 

a female student in his residence 

hall.

2020 census begins amid COVID-19

Bureau initiates data collection as many students leave campus, return home

Data collection for the 2020 

Census began early last week, 

just as many students left their 

colleges 
amid 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic to return home. 

The 
U.S. 
Census 
Bureau 

released a statement on March 

15 detailing how their operations 

would change to ensure people 

are 
accurately 
counted. 
The 

statement declared the Bureau is 

committed to counting as many 

students as possible. The Bureau 

also said students should respond 

with their school address — 

regardless of where they are 

living on Census Day, April 1 

— and has provided answers 

to common questions on their 

website. 

“We are adjusting operations 

to make sure college students are 

counted,” the press release said. 

“In general, students in colleges 

and 
universities 
temporarily 

closed due to the COVID-19 virus 

will still be counted as part of 

this process. … We are asking 

schools to contact their students 

and remind them to respond.” 

LSA 
junior 
Carolyn 
Chen, 

a political science major, said 

she thought getting students to 

respond would be difficult, as 

they may instead be focused on 

their schoolwork and the effects 

of 
COVID-19. 
She 
also 
said 

students may not understand 

the impact of the census, as it 

is not widely publicized, and 

therefore they may not take time 

to respond. 

“Unfortunately, the ... census 

is not the number one priority 

for many students right now,” 

Chen said. “The census’s impact 

is not something that gains a lot 

of recognition, and if there was 

low visibility about census issues 

before the pandemic, then there 

is probably even less visibility 

now. The news is filled with so 

many other headlines that the 

importance of data accuracy does 

not even cross many people’s 

minds.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Central 
Student 
Government’s 

Ninth Assembly held its last meeting 

virtually through a BlueJeans video 

conference Tuesday night. The 

Assembly discussed amendments 

to the CSG budget and allocations 

to the Dean of Students Emergency 

Fund, 
a 
financial 
assistance 

program run by the University 

that provides students in need 

with up to $500.

The Assembly discussed a motion 

to amend budget allocations for the 

LSAT prep course sponsored by 

CSG. Currently, course instructors 

are paid $200 for two and a half 

teaching hours a week. The motion 

proposed to pay $80 to instructors 

teaching their own class and $120 

to instructors covering another 

instructor’s class as opposed to the 

previously set weekly rate for their 

role in the program.

The 
amendment 
further 

stipulated that instructors would 

be paid $40 for attending a weekly 

meeting, but it was ruled out of 

order by Speaker Whit Froehlich, 

a Medical student, on the grounds 

that it was unconstitutional. 

Rackham student Austin Glass 

said 
he 
supported 
Froehlich’s 

ruling due to the precedent it set 

for future amendments that could 

have a negative impact on workers. 

“Overturning 
this 
ruling 

would, in my view, be a dangerous 

constitutional challenge to the 

power of CSG and the power of 

the Assembly,” Glass said. “If 

an amendment like this were 

allowed, an amendment to change 

the amount that individuals were 

paid to zero dollars would also 

be allowed. That is completely 

unacceptable and unattainable to 

me.”

The 
Assembly 
voted 
to 

overturn Froehlich’s ruling and 

after engaging in a debate, LSA 

sophomore Sam Braden proposed 

to strike the $120 being paid to 

instructors 
covering 
another 

instructor’s 
class 
from 
the 

proposed budget amendment. The 

change was made with unanimous 

consent and the Assembly voted to 

pass the budget amendment. 

Rackham 
student 
Hayden 

Jackson supported the amendment 

to the budget so that course 

instructors get paid adequately, 

citing 
that 
not 
passing 
the 

amendment due to procedural 

concerns would be unjust to the 

workers.

“What (this amendment) comes 

down to is whether you believe 

that people should be paid fairly 

for their work,” Jackson said.

The Assembly approved the 

amendment to the Winter 2020 

budget 
to 
reallocate 
$2,000 

from 
the 
Programming 
Board 

Project Account to the Legislative 

Discretionary 
Fund. 
The 

amendment was made in order to 

create sufficient funds to make 

an allocation of $20,000 from the 

fund towards the Dean of Students 

Emergency Fund.

After amending the amount to 

be allocated to $10,000 in order 

to leave sufficient funds in the 

budget for the next Assembly, the 

Assembly voted for the motion by 

unanimous consent.

The Assembly also discussed 

the screening process for the Dean 

of Students Emergency Fund and 

the idea of waiving the $500 limit 

of fund allocation to students 

displaying need from the fund 

to Dean of Students Laura Blake 

Jones. 

Because Tuesday’s meeting was 

the last of the ninth CSG Assembly, 

President Ben Gerstein, Public 

Policy junior, thanked Assembly 

members for their contributions. 

Elections for the 10th Assembly 

take 
place 
Wednesday 
and 

Thursday online at vote.umich.

edu.

“I want to thank each and 

every one of you. It’s been a really 

challenging, 
but 
rewarding 
and 

unbelievable, year. Each and every 

one of you have had an impact 

on 
my 
personal 
experience 
at 

CSG,” Gerstein said. “It’s been an 

unbelievable two and a half years. I 

really hope that you all took as much 

as I took from this Assembly this 

past year and utilize that passion you 

all have to move forward.”

CSG discusses budget changes

Doe 
claimed 
the 
sex 
was 

consensual.

Following the complaint against 

Doe, the University suspended his 

degree. Doe alleged this put his 

academic and professional future at 

risk without a full investigation in 

the lawsuit. 

According to MLive, Tarnow 

held it was unconstitutional for the 

University to suspend Doe before 

his hearing and decided all students 

accused of misconduct are entitled 

to a live hearing and a cross-

examination with the accuser. 

There is no dispute between 

the parties that Defendants’ 2018 

Policy denied Plaintiff a right to a 

hearing,” Tarnow held. “Defendants 

adjudication 
of 
the 
allegations 

against him ‘without process ... 

immediately 
collides 
with 
the 

requirements of the Constitution.’”

Doe claimed the University’s 

investigative process violated his 

due process rights because he was 

not made aware of his accuser’s 

allegations when the Office of 

Institutional Equity interviewed 

him.

Chen also explained why she 

believes the census is important, 

citing the value of congressional 

representation. She also discussed 

ways the Bureau could increase 

student response. 

“It is important that people are 

reminded that, in a time like this, 

having accurate representation and 

data can be crucial (for) public health 

and safety,” Chen said. “I think 

that it’s great that the census can be 

responded to online (because) they 

can probably get a higher rate of 

accurate responses. Right now, not a 

lot of people are willing to leave the 

house or talk to people in person, so 

using online tactics for something 

this important should definitely 

help.” 

In the press release, the Bureau 

also announced how they would 

alter data collection to ensure safe 

procedures. 
Though 
they 
have 

suspended in-person canvassing in 

certain locations, they emphasized 

the importance of counting everyone 

to ensure accurate numbers once 

they are able to resume in-person 

operations. The Bureau is also placing 

an emphasis on locations where 

students often live and places where 

homeless 
populations 
frequently 

visit. 

“In (the in-person) operation, 

census takers begin following up with 

households that haven’t responded 

yet 
around 
some 
colleges 
and 

universities,” the Bureau said. “We 

can count households in areas with 

off-campus housing before the end 

of the spring semester when students 

may leave for another residence.” 

Margaret Leary, former director 

of the University Law Library, has 

given 
educational 
presentations 

on the census and participated in 

various outreach events, such as a 

census town hall event in February. 

She said students leaving Michigan to 

return home could greatly impact the 

count and, in turn, affect the amount 

of representation apportioned to the 

state. 

“I expect the absence of students 

will lessen — and make less accurate 

— the count throughout Michigan,” 

Leary said. “College students are low 

responders because they are so busy. It 

is very possible ... they will be counted 

at home. Overall, this is probably bad 

for Michigan, because if they are 

not counted here, and are counted 

in another state, that increases the 

chance of our congressional numbers 

dropping from 14 to less. It depends 

on how well colleges and universities 

respond to the Census Bureau’s 

efforts.”

The Bureau said people can 

respond online or over the phone, and 

that they will also be participating in 

outreach efforts in hopes of increasing 

the initial response. This would 

include producing advertisements 

explaining the census and motivating 

people to fill it out.

“The Census Bureau is also 

making changes to its paid media 

campaign, earned media efforts, 

and partnership outreach efforts to 

adapt to changing conditions while 

continuing to promote self-response,” 

the press release said. “The key 

message right now for anyone with 

questions about how COVID-19 will 

affect the 2020 Census: It has never 

been easier to respond on your own, 

whether online, over the phone or by 

mail — all without having to meet a 

census taker.” 

Leary commented on the Bureau’s 

outreach efforts and how they hope 

to prevent the COVID-19 crisis from 

affecting the census. She said she 

expects the changes made to the 

process will reduce the number of 

people counted, especially among 

undocumented 
people, 
college 

students, people of color and those 

with lower degrees of education or 

low socioeconomic status.

“I am very concerned because it 

will inevitably cause the count to 

be less than it would have been for 

several reasons,” Leary said. “(It 

will impact) those groups that are 

historically least likely to respond 

either from fear and/or lack of 

knowledge of the impact of them 

not being counted. There will (also) 

be both less time and fewer Census 

Bureau workers to knock on doors to 

encourage people to respond. Each 

one of these elements will compound 

as 
the 
coronavirus 
emergency 

worsens or lengthens.”

“We know that, especially 

now with quarantines and social 

isolation, people have even less 

ability to get out and go to the 

food pantry during certain hours 

and pick up food, or maybe they 

are working or don’t have the 

transportation to get there,” 

Starman said. “So, we’ve been 

in really close contact with all 

of 
our 
community 
partners, 

our food pantries, our meal 

programs to get extra food out 

to make sure that everyone — 

children, families, individuals, 

veterans and seniors — are able 

to get food in this situation.”

In addition to the work Food 

Gatherers is doing, the Maize and 

Blue Cupboard has continued its 

services in providing food for the 

University community. Steven 

Mangan, 
senior 
director 
of 

MDining, said the organization 

plans to remain open for the 

foreseeable future because of 

a recognized need for their 

operations. MDining, donations, 

Food Gatherers, Central Student 

Government and the Dean of 

Students office support these 

operations.

Mangan said during a crisis, it 

is especially important for their 

organization 
to 
continue 
its 

mission. 

“There 
are 
a 
number 
of 

students that have been and 

will 
continue 
to 
experience 

food insecurity,” Mangan said. 

“In addition, many off-campus 

students may not have access 

to food or basic supplies. Maize 

and Blue Cupboard will provide 

these needed services to all 

students and faculty and staff 

during this crisis.”

Volunteers are continuing to 

work at both the Maize and Blue 

Cupboard and Food Gatherers, 

but precautions are being taken 

to ensure the health and safety 

of all who come in contact with 

the organization. 

Mangan 
said 
the 
Maize 

and Blue Cupboard asks their 

volunteers and shoppers about 

their health. If healthy, they 

will be admitted into the store 

in limited numbers to encourage 

distance 
from 
one 
another. 

The organization also provides 

gloves and hand sanitizer for 

their shoppers.

“Upon 
entering, 
shoppers 

are 
asked 
to 
present 
their 

MCard,” Mangan said. “Staff at 

the entry will visually observe 

and question shoppers about 

their wellness. Shoppers will 

be able to enter three at a time 

to maintain social distancing. 

They are instructed to use 

sanitizer and wear gloves that 

are provided by Maize & Blue 

Cupboard and instructions are 

posted regarding how to handle 

food. 
Shopping 
baskets 
are 

sanitized between shoppers and 

surfaces are sanitized every two 

hours.”

Starman said Food Gatherers 

is also taking similar precautions 

in terms of monitoring their 

volunteers and are asking about 

each individual’s health.

“We 
have 
modified 
our 

volunteer 
opportunities,” 

Starman said. “We don’t have 

them in congregate situations 

like with our volunteers in our 

community kitchen. We have 

stopped some of our normal 

volunteer roles, like not having 

volunteers in our warehouse. 

We are also having everybody 

answer questions before they 

volunteer and then when they 

come to the shift, such as, ‘Have 

you been sick? Are you sick? Have 

you traveled out of the country 

within this certain amount of 

time? Are you in a risk group?’”

Additional community groups 

and individuals have reached 

out to Food Gatherers to donate 

their help, such as Cottage Inn 

Pizza and BD’s Mongolian Grill, 

according to Starman. 

LSA junior Aaron Boockvar-

Klein said he feels these food 

donations show a lot about the 

way society deals with crises. He 

also said he thinks there will be 

many eager volunteers.

“During the last week or so, 

I’ve seen a lot of people come 

together and to get through this 

time by just being generous for 

no gains,” Boockvar-Klein said. 

“I think there are a lot of people 

at home right now looking for 

something to do, and people 

wanting to make a difference 

in this crisis. So, I think there 

would be a lot of people willing 

to volunteer their time, or extra 

food if they have it.”

What you need to know for the student 
government elections this week

The Daily compiled a list of frequently asked questions regarding how to vote 

Though students are scattered 

across the globe as classes move 

online for the semester, the University 

of Michigan student governments 

will still hold elections online this 

Wednesday and Thursday, March 

25-26. Here is what you need to know.

What am I voting on?

Students 
are 
electing 

representatives for their schools to 

the Central Student Government 

Assembly. There is also a University-

wide election for the executive ticket 

of 
Central 
Student 
Government, 

the Michigan Police Department 

Oversight 
Committee 
and 
the 

adoption of an instant run-off voting 

policy. These positions are all year-

long terms. Depending on the school, 

there may also be specific proposals or 

policies for students to vote on.

Who is eligible to vote?

For the executive ticket of CSG, 

any student regardless of grade or 

school is eligible to vote. There are 

also elections for CSG Assembly 

representatives within each school 

at the University and any student 

can vote for their respective school’s 

representative. 
Some 
school-wide 

student governments, like LSA’s, are 

also housing their ballots within the 

election website, where any student in 

any school will be able to vote for their 

school’s student government. 

How and when can I vote? 

Voting 
begins 
on 
Wednesday, 

March 25 at midnight and closes on 

Thursday, March 26 at 11:59 p.m. 

All voting takes place online at vote.

umich.edu except for the College of 

Engineering’s election, which happens 

at vote.studentlife.umich.edu. 

Why do some schools have more 

openings than others?

Each school is allotted a certain 

number of representatives based 

on the total number of students 

at the University enrolled in each 

school. LSA, the largest school at the 

University, has 14 representatives, 

while smaller schools, like the School 

of Education, have as few as one seat.

Does how I rank the candidates 

matter?

Yes. 
In 
student 
government 

elections, a form of ranked-choice 

voting is used. This means students 

rank their preferences for the position 

with the option to rank as many 

candidates as there are open positions. 

So, for the CSG executive ticket, there 

is only one spot to rank because only 

one pair can hold the office, while 

for 
representative 
elections 
with 

multiple seats, voters can rank multiple 

candidates for those seats.

For the smaller schools, this has 

little impact. However, when there 

is more than one seat open, like for 

LSA’s 14, a different numerical value is 

given to each candidate based on how 

high they are ranked. That means a 

candidate who is ranked as a voter’s 

first choice receives more points from 

that voter than the candidate ranked as 

their second choice.

The 
voting 
frequently 
asked

What is the difference between 

CSG 
and 
school-wide 
student 

governments?

CSG is the student government of 

the entire University student body, 

containing representation from every 

school, including graduate programs. 

CSG is known for its AirBus program 

offering free rides to and from the 

airport, its game day hydration stations 

and for providing funding to student 

organizations.

Individual 
schools’ 
student 

governments are composed of students 

in programs within those schools. 

These

In September 2018, shortly after 

Doe’s lawsuit was filed, the U.S. 

Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals 

struck 
down 
the 
University’s 

single-investigator 
process 
in 

Doe v. Baum, a different sexual 

misconduct 
lawsuit. 
The 
court 

ordered the University to create 

an 
interim 
sexual 
misconduct 

policy that incorporates cross-

examination and a live hearing. 

The cross-examination process 

has 
been 
largely 
criticized 

on 
campus 
with 
claims 
it 

re-traumatizes the survivor by 

forcing them to face their alleged 

assaulter.

In June 2019, the University filed 

a motion to dismiss the lawsuit 

and 
claimed 
the 
due 
process 

argument Doe made was no longer 

relevant due to the new policy. 

Though the motion was dismissed, 

the 
University 
maintained 
the 

argument. 

In October 2019, Doe’s suspension 

was lifted and he is now re-enrolled 

in classes at the University.

O

ct. 5, 2018. The Senate 

chamber held its collective 

breath as Sen. Susan 

Collins, R-Maine, rose from the desk 

once occupied by civil and women’s 

rights activist Sen. John Sherman 

Cooper, R-Ky., to waste nearly an 

hour of time and announce that she 

would vote to elevate accused sexual 

assailant and calendar enthusiast 

Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme 

Court. During her winding speech, 

Collins 
addressed 
everything 

from her reservations about the 

judge to the reality of the #MeToo 

movement. Collins was flanked by 

two fellow GOP senators: Shelley 

Moore Capito, R-W.Va., and Cindy 

Hyde-Smith, R-Miss. 

The former is supposedly pro-

abortion rights, yet she voted to 

permanently ban federal funding for 

abortions, including Medicaid. So, 

for Capito, it’s morally permissible to 

have an abortion ... as long as you’re 

not poor. The latter made a truly 

inexplicable joke about lynching 

during her 2018 Senate campaign 

against a Black man. When asked if 

she regretted the comment, Hyde-

Smith said she was sorry that people 

were offended. This trio elevated 

the first explicitly pro-beer Supreme 

Court 
justice, 
which 
allowed 

Republicans — especially the 6’3” 

Cheeto topped with a Pringle in the 

White House — to use Kavanaugh 

to galvanize the base in the 2018 

midterms.

Enter Sen. Marsha Blackburn, 

R-Tenn. As a politics nerd, I first 

saw Blackburn when she was 

just 
a 
climate-change-denying 

representative who debated Bill Nye 

— yes, that Bill Nye — about global 

warming on NBC’s Meet the Press. 

As someone who easily experiences 

secondhand 
embarrassment, 

watching the vice chair of the 

Energy and Commerce Committee 

get ripped to shreds on national 

television made me experience 

several 
levels 
of 
discomfort. 

Highlights of the debate include 

Blackburn calling climate change an 

“unproven hypothesis” and claiming 

that the Earth had cooled over the 

last 13 years. The constant lies and 

disinformation made her a darling of 

the right-wing. 

This energy also fueled her 2018 

Senate campaign against Tennessee 

Gov. Phil Bredesen. Conventionally, 

Bredesen — being a former governor, 

centrist and generally boring guy 

— would have been competitive in 

this race. But, on the back of the 

Kavanaugh-induced 
conservative 

rage, Blackburn wiped the floor 

with Bredesen, winning by 10.8 

percent despite being outspent by $3 

million. Since she has been in office, 

Blackburn has continued to support 

the far-right and the interests of the 

president, blocking three different 

election security measures in a move 

that made #MoscowMartha trend 

on Twitter. She has also baselessly 

attacked 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 

Alexander 
Vindman 
for 
being 

“unpatriotic.” 

The 
midterm 
elections 
also 

brought 
Sen. 
Martha 
McSally, 

R-Ariz., to national prominence 

through her loss to the most 

interesting woman in the world, 

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. Now, 

while I would love to spend the 

rest of this article talking about 

Sinema’s illustrious side hustle as 

a triathlete, I cannot. Suffice it to 

say, she is amazing, which fueled 

her 2.34 percent win to take over 

the seat previously held by Sen. Jeff 

Flake, R-Ariz. However, after the 

election, Gov. Doug Ducey pulled 

a switcheroo on the people of the 

Grand Canyon state and appointed 

McSally, who had just lost statewide, 

to sit in the other Senate seat vacated 

by the late Sen. John McCain, 

R-Ariz. In McSally’s time in the 

Senate, she has taken on the mantle 

of a “warrior,” repeatedly berating 

journalists, blaming Democrats for 

the coronavirus and belittling sexual 

assault survivors, despite being one 

herself. Now, don’t get me wrong, I 

believe McSally sharing her story is 

incredibly brave and commendable, 

but stealing a Senate seat and using 

that national perch to degrade our 

country and make lasting structural 

damage to our institutions is 

completely unacceptable. However, 

McSally is not the only person who 

cheated and lied in order to gain 

power.

Remember how I said earlier 

that there was a 6’3” Cheeto topped 

with a Pringle who was in the 

White House? Well now, sadly, we 

have to talk about him. Specifically, 

we have to talk about his role in 

shaping all of the aforementioned 

women’s political careers. Prior 

to the Trump era, Collins was 

moderate, pro-abortion rights and 

consistently spoke in defense of 

moral leadership. Capito was a 

moderate with a strong women’s 

rights agenda. McSally was a Paul 

Ryan critic. The Trump effect has 

been pronounced for all of these 

women, especially those who have 

received promotions in the Trump 

era: Blackburn and McSally. Their 

political legacies are so intertwined 

with Trump that they must echo not 

only his policy preferences but also 

his toxic rhetoric and lies. See, since 

the Republican Party is increasingly 

male-dominated 
in 
both 

representatives and constituents, the 

women who remain have become 

“Trumpified.” Unlike the old white 

guys who are inherently assumed 

to be on their side, GOP women 

have to prove themselves to a sexist 

base. This extra level of scrutiny and 

purity testing makes female senators 

from moderate Maine to ruby-red 

Mississippi 
reconsider 
political 

positions that they previously held, 

which in turn gives the president 

an increased hand in shaping the 

Congressional GOP.

While Republicans have pursued 

this strategy, Democrats have taken 

a different approach by allowing 

their young female representatives 

to span the ideological spectrum, 

from Bloomberg-endorser Rep. Lucy 

McBath, D-Ga., to Bernie Bro and 

democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria 

Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. This diversity 

inside the Democratic caucus has 

allowed for a robust policy debate 

surrounding issues like Medicare 

for All and a Green New Deal, while 

the Republicans’ united front has not 

yielded much except a ballooning 

deficit and a corporate tax cut. 

The Democrats have been allowed 

to build such a broad coalition by 

not having a Trump-like figure 

to dominate the scene. Instead, 

the national party has allowed 

for debate and discussion around 

policies rather than insisting on 

political allegiance.

Now, I’m not saying Republican 

women should want Trump to lose 

in 2020 — especially because that 

would change many of their political 

fortunes — but it would ultimately be 

better for democracy and the GOP. 

A debate over Trumpism among 

Republicans and, more importantly, 

a reckoning for the behaviors 

of this era might just usher in a 

kinder, gentler, more compassionate 

conservative party. Even though 

I still won’t vote for them, it’s a 

movement I can support.

S

ince the University of Michigan’s 

initial COVID-19 announcement 

on March 11, students have been 

feeling overwhelmed, to say the least. 

The uncertainty that comes from a 

surreal crisis like the one we are facing 

induces heightened levels of stress 

and anxiety for both students and 

community members. The University 

administrators’ 
fumbled, 
multi-day 

rollout of their response measures did 

little to mitigate these fears.

In the midst of universities and 

governments around the globe enacting 

unprecedented policies, people want to 

cling to what is comfortable. Yearning 

for normalcy during a crisis is natural. 

Some students are still hanging out with 

friends and visiting on-campus spots 

while taking precautions. To many, this 

type of response seems reasonable.

It is not. 

By only providing additional clarity 

and toughening their policies March 

17, the University helped facilitate 

this dangerous attitude. The March 11 

statement did not take a clear stance on 

whether or not students should leave 

campus, only specifying that housing 

and dining halls would continue to 

operate. By not conspicuously stating 

they wanted students to leave if they 

were able to, the University caused 

confusion and many people, quite 

understandably, decided to remain on 

campus for the time being and go about 

their lives as normally as possible.

This widespread desire to stay in Ann 

Arbor for the semester briefly influenced 

my plans. I could have easily driven 

myself an hour and a half to my moms’ 

house in Kalamazoo, but I wanted to stay 

on campus. I figured being in Ann Arbor 

would help me focus on my schoolwork 

and avoid the probable challenges of 

moving back home. I reasoned that I 

could stay if I exercised precautions, 

such as limiting my movement outside 

of my residence hall and not meeting up 

with large groups. Many of my friends 

and hallmates were planning on sticking 

around, too. 

This sentiment was echoed by what I 

witnessed on my social media feeds, as 

students posted photos from bars, joked 

about spending $20 to fly internationally 

and shared statments like the following: 

“I’d rather be dead in Ann Arbor than 

alive in my hometown.” Soon after the 

University switched to online classes, I 

noticed that students were continuing 

to attend informal events with more 

than 10 people and neglecting to adhere 

to proper social distancing measures at 

such gatherings.

This approach exhibits privilege that 

is, quite literally, deadly.

It is imperative for those who have 

the ability to go to an alternative, 

safe location to do so. Crowded living 

environments like residence halls and 

sorority houses would make the virus 

remarkably easy to spread to others and 

make it difficult for individuals who 

have been exposed to properly self-

quarantine. Many people who have the 

coronavirus might not even realize they 

are carrying it, being that some of those 

who are infected are asymptomatic. 

About 81 percent of cases are mild, 

which is likely higher among younger 

demographics. A lack of caution among 

students, coupled with the effortless 

transmission of the virus, will only 

spread it wider and faster, further 

risking vulnerable populations and 

increasing the number of patients that 

health care workers will need to aid.

Additionally, not taking the advice 

to move home is seriously harmful to 

students who have no other choice but 

to stay. Some people simply don’t have 

the funds to travel or a safe place to 

go. International students are caught 

in incredibly difficult situations due 

to travel restrictions, while out-of-

state students have to choose between 

waiting it out or making the trek back 

home — potentially increasing their 

risk of exposure by traveling across the 

country — to be with their families. 

Others might need the food provided 

by campus dining halls or need to work 

jobs in Ann Arbor to make ends meet. 

Staying on campus means frequenting 

common spaces like dining halls and 

grocery stores while continuing to 

live in tight quarters, making social 

distancing harder and putting the 

students who must stay here at an 

increased risk of exposure.

By risking transmission of the virus 

in a condensed campus environment 

like that of Ann Arbor, people with 

the ability to return to safer homes 

elsewhere are only adding to the 

problem. Even though it might not 

present a severe risk to you personally, 

staying on campus and spreading 

the disease could mean life or death 

for others. Although not explicitly, 

doing this prioritizes those who are 

healthy, young and wealthy over 

those who are immunocompromised, 

elderly, undocumented, disabled and 

impoverished. Not taking the threat 

COVID-19 presents seriously is a 

demonstration of blatant privilege that 

will inevitably weaken public health 

efforts to combat the virus and prolong 

its adverse effects on society.

This is our chance to come together 

and do something good. By following 

preventative measures — like moving 

off-campus and not socializing with 

friends in person — we can prevent this 

pandemic from saturating the capacity 

of our health care system and causing 

long-term disruption to society. If you 

are privileged enough to have a choice, 

choose to help the vulnerable people 

who need us to do our part.

At some point, everyone pictures their life as 

a movie. Be it studying to “Battle Without Honor 

Or Humanity” and pretending to wield a samurai 

sword, mourning a breakup to “Visions of Gideon” 

and doing your best Chalamet or driving like 

James Bond to his theme song, we’ve turned 

the world into our own film, soundtrack and all. 

Lately, though, my inner movies have all veered 

toward one genre: apocalypse. 

To paraphrase Bob Dylan — Corona, Corona, 

gal, you’re on my mind. 

Coronavirus came slowly, advancing like the 

horde in “Night of The Living Dead.” At first, it 

seemed too far away to do any damage, and slow 

enough to be stopped by a capable government. 

Yet in the beginning of March, there it was, 

pounding our door down and stretching its filthy 

hands toward us. 

First it took the schools. Then the restaurants. 

The bars, the libraries, the movie theatres. 

Borders, airports, friends. Writing this article, 

outside my window, the streets are practically 

desolate, like something out of “28 Days Later.” 

To make things worse, our situation is more 

“War of The Worlds” than any zombie movie. 

Zombies are easily killed while, without a vaccine 

or cure, coronavirus is a much more complex 

threat, attacking a society powerless to stop it. We 

spend our days waiting, watching for symptoms 

that could appear at any moment and wreak 

havoc. If my life was actually a movie, I would 

scream, “Cut!” Yet I, like everyone else, am stuck 

living through this horror show.

We’re all (if we’re smart) socially distancing. 

That means most of us are living out our own 

renditions of “I am Legend” or “10 Cloverfield 

Lane.” So how should we fill these empty hours, 

waiting for the zombies to come? 

All jokes aside, what I watch is vital to my mental 

state, especially in times of stress. A few days ago, 

in a moment of weakness, I made the ill-advised 

choice to watch “Outbreak.” Needless to say, I 

became even more terrified than I already was. 

Watching a fictional deadly American pandemic 

while living through a deadly American pandemic 

isn’t exactly the most comforting pastime. Don’t 

be like me. 

After “Outbreak,” I searched for another movie. 

Choosing something too carefree wouldn’t work, 

plastic and sugar-sweet would just remind me of 

the dire straits my life was veering toward. Yet 

darkness clearly wasn’t a good idea either; just 

looking at the poster for “The Mist” gave me a 

cold sweat. I needed an escape, but one that was 

honest. Thankfully, I found the perfect film on the 

Criterion Channel. 

When “Until The End of The World” was 

released in 1991, it was a critical and commercial 

failure. Even at almost four hours, it was deemed 

inscrutable — Roger Ebert called it “a film that 

was photographed before it was written, and 

edited before it was completed.” 

Yet the film that was released in 1991 wasn’t 

director Wim Wender’s (“Paris, Texas”) true 

vision: The studio had forced him to trim the 

movie by at least an hour. No wonder things were 

jumbled. Wenders and his editor then copied the 

film negative at their own expense, making a five-

hour version that they showed throughout the 

world. This September, the Criterion Collection 

made it official, restoring and releasing the 

Wenders Cut. 

“Until The End of The World” is a road movie, a 

love story, a noir film, a science fiction allegory and 

a hopeful meditation on storytelling. It’s the apex 

of what cinema can achieve, crossing continents, 

genres, tones and technological eras. Best of all, 

the plot matches what we’re going through almost 

exactly. 

It begins with Claire Tourneur, played by 

Solveig Dommartin (“Wings of Desire”), waking 

up in Venice toward the end of a Rococo-futurist 

style party (think “Marie Antoinette” meets 

“Blade Runner”). To the tune of “Sax and Violins” 

by Talking Heads, she walks through this fading 

celebration, passing intoxicated dancers in silk 

dresses and stepping over passed out drunks in 

tuxedos. In her eyes we see that she’s tired of this 

life, sick of the overwrought frivolity on display. 

After she leaves the party and decides to head 

home to Paris, we learn that it’s also the end of the 

world. 

In 
this 
alternate, 
futuristic 
1999, 
a 

malfunctioning nuclear satellite heads toward 

Earth and nobody knows where it will hit. Many 

clog the streets in a panicked effort to escape 

predicted drop zones, some hunker down and stay 

home, while many party their days away. In the 

age of COVID-19, this situation was hauntingly 

relevant. As I watched many I knew get drunk, 

lock themselves in their rooms or pack in a flurry 

and rush home, I wondered if the world would ever 

become normal again. All around me, lives were 

upended because of an unstoppable, inexplicable 

existential threat. Like Claire, I felt lost and was 

sick of it. 

Yet Claire is soon rescued by this ennui when 

her car crashes and she meets two bank robbers 

who need her help. This quest soon becomes 

another, then another, and before one knows it 

they have followed Claire from Venice to Paris, 

Lisbon, Berlin and Moscow, all before the movie is 

even halfway over. Almost instantly, this traveling 

cured my quarantine blues. The soundtrack 

mirrors the breadth of scope, too; there’s music 

from the likes of Talking Heads, U2, Lou Reed, 

REM, Elvis Costello, Patti Smith and Julee Cruise. 

If nothing else, “Until The End of The World” will 

add some new songs to your playlist. 

The film’s final act takes place in the stunning 

Australian Outback and involves a scientist 

played by the recently departed, legendary icon 

Max Von Sydow (“The Exorcist”). As always, his 

performance is a highlight. The scientist lives 

with an Aboriginal tribe, and has shades of Steve 

Jobs, Doctor Moreau and Colonel Kurtz. The 

Aboriginal characters’ culture, like the other 

cultures depicted in this movie, are treated with 

great depth and respect, which even now is 

incredibly rare. There’s also an anti-imperialist, 

anti-capitalist message that still rings true, 

especially when many modern movies’ versions 

of representation so frequently involve a white 

savior. 

So much of the film is relevant that I’m tempted 

to call it prophetic. Characters use video chat to 

communicate, all money is electronic, the wealth 

gap is horrific, gun violence is rampant, substance 

abuse is widespread, the globe is connected both 

virtually and physically and everyone lives in fear 

of an imminent, deadly threat. Sound familiar? 

The movie predicted the technology boom and 

globalization of the 21st century, while also seeing 

the dangers of climate change, nuclear power and 

the addictive nature of digital life. It displays how 

advancement isn’t always what it’s cracked up to 

be — after all, haven’t these past few weeks shown 

us how those in a connected world suffer together?

Yet, time and time again in “Until The End of 

The World,” characters still seek joy. Be it through 

music, a walk through the woods, a trip to another 

city or just a good book, Claire and those around 

her find happiness through escape, even if it is in 

the briefest of moments and the direst of situations.

Finding solace in Wenders’ ‘Until the End of the World’

FILM NOTEBOOK

Two weeks ago, I wrote about the cancellation 

of South by Southwest resulting from the COVID-

19 pandemic. It’s safe to say that in the two 

weeks since that article was published, a lot has 

changed in the state of Michigan. As of midnight 

on Monday, Mar. 23, Governor Whitmer’s Stay 

Home Stay Safe executive order (which intends 

to halt any “non-essential” public gatherings or 

activities) was brought into effect. This policy 

was enacted with the news of over 1,000 cases of 

COVID-19 being found in Michigan in the last 13 

days.

I’m sure this news is (hopefully) not new to 

anyone, and I’m sure most people are aware 

of how this global pandemic is affecting every 

industry. The entertainment industry, specifically 

live music, has especially felt the impacts of this 

situation, with countless tours and performances 

canceled. For some, these cancellations come 

with the loss of income. Two weeks ago, I don’t 

think that I had yet grasped the gravity of the 

situation. But over the past fortnight, I’ve started 

to realize just how impactful this will be for the 

world of music as well as the world at large.

I spoke with Ypsilanti musician Chandler 

Loch, known for his project Ness Lake, about how 

things have changed in the music community 

over the past few weeks. Loch spoke about the 

financial implications over the halt of live music. 

“You can see the desperation and sadness in 

every tour and show cancellation because in the 

‘digital streaming age’ the most profitable way 

for musicians to stay afloat is by selling physical 

merchandise at their 

shows,” Loch said. 

Even 
though 

musicians have lost 

such a major avenue 

for revenue with the 

cancellation of live 

performances, they 

still have options. 

“The 
digital 

age also allows us 

a sense of online 

community 
that’s 

being fully utilized 

by musicians,” Loch 

said. 

Platforms 
like 

Bandcamp 
allow 

fans 
to 
purchase 

merchandise 
and 

albums 
as 
well 

as stream them, while taking only a small 

percentage of the profits. However, even with 

the small commision the platform takes, the site 

decided to waive their revenue share this past 

Friday and give 100% of the profits to the artists 

in an attempt to support these musicians. 

And it worked.

The site reported that, “on a typical Friday, 

fans buy about 47,000 items on Bandcamp, but 

this past Friday, fans bought nearly 800,000, or 

$4.3 million worth 

of music and merch. 

That’s more than 15 

times 
our 
normal 

Friday, and at the 

peak, 
fans 
were 

buying 11 items per 

second.” All for the 

music makers.

Amid 
all 
of 

the 
cancellations 

announced 
over 

the past few weeks, 

it started to seem 

like live music may 

be halted for a bit. 

But in the age of the 

Internet, that wasn’t 

the case. As time has 

gone by, I’ve started 

to see more and 

more musicians hosting live streams on various 

platforms, whether it’s my friend practicing his 

scales on his oboe through Facebook live, or Willie 

Nelson and Neil Young streaming on Twitch.

Ness Lake was recently able to perform on a 

livestream for Common Ground Collective and 

Home Outgrown Presents, two organizations 

that put together live performances; the digital 

show was live streamed on Instagram. 

“I think that the event that I participated in 

went really well!” Loch told me.“It was exciting to 

‘share a stage’ with some of my favorite musicians 

across the country. Many people logged in to see 

the art that I have to share and they said nice 

things about it. I always chalk that up as a win.”

With musicians trying to adapt to this new 

situation, it’s more important than ever to offer 

them support, even when live performances start 

happening again. 

“I think that consumers have to realize that 

artists make next to nothing off of music,” Loch 

said. “Even the ones in my circles that folks may 

consider ‘more established’ often have to work 

menial jobs whenever they’re not creating just to 

keep their lives afloat. The unfortunate reality is 

that the industry is created to sap the hard-earned 

compensation we deserve.”

See Ness Lake perform from the comfort of 

Loch’s apartment this Wednesday, Mar. 25 with 

the Obsessives and Shortly at 5:00 p.m. on @

homeoutgrown’s Instagram channel, and stay 

safe. Along with supporting these musicians, 

following the CDC’s guidelines is incredibly 

important. Creating and consuming art has been 

incredibly therapeutic for me in these times, and I 

hope it can be for you, too.

I decided to write about my love for The

to say goodbye to Ann Arbor and its many 

strange institutions that I love. As such, 

this piece feels entirely bittersweet, tinted

my favorite concert hall in town would 

normally be.

venue 
online 

brings 
images 

of 
performers 

like the Flaming 

Lips, 
Kim 

Gordon, Darren 

Criss and Theo 

Katzman.

Upon entry, you can feel the proud 

grittiness that exists not only within 

the mirrors and framed photographs on 

the sides of the performance venue, but 

even the popcorn machine near the bar. 

The disco ball overhead always casts the 

perfect amount of sparks for each concert 

goer, romanticizing the dark, cramped 

space. Red and blue lights saturate the 

walls and the faces of those around you, 

and the checkered floor beneath your feet 

only sticks slightly. The bar serves as an 

oasis of cooling drinks and (if you’re lucky) 

provides occasional free water that allows 

you a breather from the intense mess 

of the dance floor. The shared sweat of 

carefree dancers makes it a place certainly 

not immune to infectious natures of any 

kind. It’s absolutely wonderful.

The stage is quite small, allowing 

artists to connect with the crowd more 

intimately, 
sometimes 
even 
thrusting 

themselves forward into the crowd when 

fits of passion overtake their performance. 

The small size of the venue permits crowds 

to fill the room with their presence. You’re 

close enough to see the way the lead 

singer shifts from foot to foot nervously, 

to observe the shared glance between the 

keyboard player and bassist, to hear the 

drummers exhaled laugh as he hits that 

groove just right. This place isn’t the kind 

of “alternative” where you have to style 

yourself to look like you’re protesting 

fashion’s mainstream ways; people are 

there for the music and the good time, 

not 
to 
show 

off. 
It’s 
hard 

to 
imagine 
a 

more informal, 

welcoming 

place. 
At 
one 

show, I watched 

as the drummer 

jogged off stage 

to the back of 

the room to grab 

a beer from the 

bar, and then 

made 
it 
back 

onstage before 

the band’s vamp 

had gone on too 

long.

I’ve seen the 

room 
packed 

to capacity for 

Cory Wong (the 

guitarist 
from 

popular 
funk 

band Vulfpeck) 

and his band. 

The crowd frothed and surged, navigating 

their way around the pillar in the middle 

of the room. You had to fight with your 

elbows in a way that made it all the more 

rewarding when you finally got halfway 

through the room. 

I’ve seen the room with maybe 40 

people in it for a college band show. People 

reveled in the open space, throwing their 

bodies with abandon, imitating what 

might loosely be called “dance moves.” 

The passion of the performers was not 

diminished. It was worth my eight dollars.

I’m not sure if it’s the classic bathroom 

graffiti, the vending machine that sells 

cigarettes or the warm buzz of neon 

lighting inside, but The Blind Pig has its 

own brand of dirt-covered charm that 

goes beyond your typical dive. It is filled 

with history in the least pretentious way 

possible, and carves out a space for all. Its 

faded light-up sign provides a welcoming 

torch to a true Ann Arbor institution. And 

personally, I can’t wait to be back.

“Self-Made: Inspired by the Life of 

Madam C.J. Walker” is a historical 

retelling of the life of Sarah Walker, 

(Octavia 
Spencer, 
“Hidden 
Figures”) 

a washerwoman who became the first 

female self-made millionaire during the 

Gilded Age. The story follows Sarah as 

she escapes the condescending glare of 

the light-skinned, beautiful Addie Munroe 

(Carmen Ejogo, “Selma”) and begins to 

sell her own hair-growth product made 

specifically for Black women.Working 

against the patriarchy, Eurocentric beauty 

standards and blunt racism, Walker single-

handedly turns her spite into a massive 

enterprise. 

The themes the show purports are 

self-evident and wholly American. With 

hard work and determination, you can 

pull yourself up by the bootstraps. While 

the “American Dream” comprises the 

backbone 
of 

the 
show, 
the 

narrative’s 

inclusion 
of 

other tangential 

themes 
reveal 

barriers to the 

achievement 
of 

the 
“American 

Dream” 
that 

often 
go 

unmentioned. 

In 
fact, 
the 

show 
manages 

to efficiently do 

the 
impossible 

— 
balance 

colorism, racism 

and feminism in 

an efficient and 

nuanced way. 

In “Self-Made,” no “-ism” supersedes 

another. Race doesn’t supersede the 

importance of gender, nor does gender 

supersede color. Instead, the characters’ 

alliances shift to push back against the 

oppressive force of the moment. For 

example, while Addie Munroe and Sarah 

Walker are sworn rivals due to their 

skin color differences, Addie signals 

her support for Walker as she fights for 

a chance to speak at a male-dominated 

convention. Despite their conflict, both 

recognize the need for female solidarity. 

While the show focuses on the fascinating 

intersections of Walker’s gender and race 

struggle, it fails to explore another equally 

important aspect of Walker’s character: 

class.

We live in a peculiar time. On one 

hand, the myth of the American Dream 

is crumbling in front of our eyes. On the 

other hand, society has become more 

receptive to the idea that positions of 

power should be occupied by people who 

aren’t white males. Should we dismantle 

power structures or simply reoccupy 

them with different faces? “Self-Made” 

obviously supports the latter. Central 

aspects to Walker’s life, such as her 

position as a working class washerwoman 

are only mentioned as a tool to juxtapose 

her past with her present. 

Perhaps the most egregious example of 

this dissonance is one of the final scenes 

of the show. In the final chapter of “Self-

Made,” Walker’s employees protest the 

deal she made in the industry that would 

jeopardize their jobs. One might expect 

the show to focus on this dilemma. Perhaps 

Walker would give a passionate speech 

where she would recount her working-

class past, and thus her sympathy towards 

her 
workers. 

Perhaps 
(more 

realistically) 

she would fire 

her 
workers, 

and 
the 
show 

would 
focus 

on 
aspects 
of 

her 
personality 

that were less 

glamorous. 

Instead the show 

does 
neither. 

Walker 
simply 

says she won’t 

go through with 

the deal, despite 

the 
fact 
that 

every aspect of 

her 
character 

shows she will 

break down every barrier to her success. 

This scene speaks for a particular purpose 

of the show. Despite the title, “Self-Made” 

isn’t truly about the life of the human 

being Sarah Walker. It’s about the idea 

of Madam CJ Walker, a larger-than-life 

figure, living proof that all barriers can, 

and should, be shattered. 

Ultimately, 
“Self-Made” 
is 
a 
very 

empowering show. The central character’s 

story is remarkable and worth exploring. 

Like other “empowering” media, it feels 

good to watch. It feels good to watch 

someone overcome overwhelming odds. It 

feels good to beat back racism, sexism and 

colorism. It feels good to be empowered, 

just don’t think about what you can do 

with that power.

Don’t think on it too much, 
and you’ll enjoy ‘Self-Made’
