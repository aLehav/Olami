NCAA INVESTIGATION
Coleman
dodges NCAA
question at
fireside chat

CATWALKING FOR A CAUSE

Coleman: 'Both I
and the AD take this
very seriously'
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
and KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
and Daily NewsEditor
At an intimate meeting with
about 50 students yesterday, Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man discussed a wide range of
issues including the NCAA's recent
allegations against the Michigan
football program.
At the gather- NOTEBOOK
ing, which was
one of Coleman's monthly fireside
chats where students are invited
to discuss campus issues with
her, one student brought up the
NCAA investigation and recently
announced set of allegations, ask-
ing Coleman if the University had
a zero tolerance policy for major
violations of NCAA rules.
The charges, which were
announced last month, include
allegations that the football pro-
gram violated rules regarding the
number of coaches that can work
with student-athletes, exceeded
the limit of allowable practice
hours and that Michigan football

coach Rich Rodriguez did not pro-
mote an "atmosphere of compli-
ance," among other allegations.
Coleman did not explicitly
address the student's question
regarding the investigation, and
said the rest of the process needed
to play out first. The University has
90 days from when they received
the allegations to respond and Uni-
versity officials will also appear
before the NCAA's Committee on
Infractions in August.
"These are allegations and I
think we need to let the process
play out," Coleman said. "I do think
it does matter whether there was
intent or not. ..don't know that
yet."
However, Coleman did say she
wouldn't try to dodge any allega-
tions that prove to be true.
"We are not going to make any
excuses. If there are things that
we've done wrong, then we'll make
sure that we correct them," she
said. "We are still going through
the process. Both I and the AD take
this very seriously."
Coleman continued by saying

Officials say if

By ANNIE GORDON THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
With about six months left until
the start of football season, athlet-

ic department officials say they've
sold 57 of the 81 new suites in
Michigan Stadium, which will be
unveiled for the first game of the
upcoming season in the fall.
But Joe Parker, senior associate
athletic director for development,
said he isn't concerned that all of
the suites haven't been sold yet.
According to Parker, the 57
buyers' first year's payments
have been collected. Four of the
57 buyers have also already paid

their contractual commitments -
which span a minimum of three
years - in full.
According to a Feb. 12 Detroit
Free Press article, 2,822 commit-
ments have been made to purchase
the new club seats being built.
About 3,000. indoor and outdoor
club seats are available on the east
side of the stadium and run from
about $1,500 to $4,000 each in
addition to the price of a season
ticket. In place of the old press

box, 704 "chair back" seats are also
available for $2,000 each.
"We're only right now in March
and have roughly half of a year to
secure commitments before the
first game of the 2010 season," he
said.
According to Parker, when the
athletic department reaches the
point at which they've sold 70 per-
cent of the suites and club seats,
the project will have paid for itself.

DESTRUCTING REALITY

GETTING AROUND MICHAG
University Research Corridor
to study transportation issues

'U,' MSU and Wayne
State to host
transportation
summit in Detroit
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
Researchers from universities
across Michigan are hoping to
revitalize transportation in the
state that's famous for its once

illustrious auto industry.
The University Research Cor-
ridor - an organization composed
of administrators from the Uni-
versity of Michigan, Michigan
State University and Wayne State
University - is starting a new
multi-disciplinary consortium
that will work toward formulating
solutions for transportation prob-
lems in the state.
The new program, called
Transforming Transportation:
Economies & Communities, will
host a summit in Detroit this

October, in order to jumpstart the
brainstorming process.
Matt Seeger, chair of the
Department of Communication at
Wayne State University, said the
goal of the consortium is to bring
together a group of scholars inter-
ested in addressing transportation
problems in the state.
Seeger said the state's transpor-
tation challenges are multi-facet-
ed and that solutions that focus on
just one area won't be successful.
"It's not a technological fix by

Grocery Delivery
aims to slim down
students' food bills
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
Two students are trying to make
it easier for students without a car
to get much needed groceries with-

out relying solely on stores close to
campus like White Market and Vil-
lage Corner.
Started in November 2009 by
LSA freshmen Lukas Garske and
Michael Zhang, Ann Arbor Gro-
cery Delivery is a new student-run
business that offers students same-
day grocery deliveries at a smaller
markup than local grocery stores,
the students said.
The business was developed
last semester and started deliver-
ing last month. Garske and Zhang

are currently running the business
single-handedly, though Zhang
said once they get more costum-
ers they plan to hire an additional
driver. '
Zhang said he's been wanting to
start his own business for a while.
Though a grocery delivery service
wasn't his original idea, he decided
it would bea good investment after
conducting some research.

George Mitchell visited Israel
earlier this week to hold an open
discussion on Israeli-Palestinian
relations. Though these peace
talks are often brokered on an
international stage, political
action regardingthe dispute in the

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
* Detroit woman
involved in federal
food-aid fraud
Authorities say a Detroit city
employee sold food-assistance cou-
pons for years to people who didn't
qualify, costing the U.S. govern-
ment as much as $648,000.
A judge unsealed a criminal
complaint yesterday against Jac-
queline Taylor. A federal agent says
Taylor sold WIC coupons and deb-
it-style cards for about eight years
while working at a health clinic on
Detroit's east side.
The federal WIG program pays
" for certain grocery items for moth-
ers and children.
Taylor appeared to turn remorse-
ful. A year ago, agents searching
her workplace found a handwritten
note in her Bible that said, "Dear
Lord, I have done somethingwrong
as you know. ... So please I hope
they look over this."
A phone message seeking com-
ment was left for Taylor.
WASHINGTON
Obama to donate
Nobel Prize money
to Haiti survivors
President Barack Obama plans
to donate the $1.4 million from his
Nobel Peace Prize to helping stu-
dents, veterans' families and survi-
vors of Haiti's earthquake, among
others, drawing attention to orga-
nizations he said "do extraordinary
work."
Obama is giving a total of
$750,000 to six groups that help
kids go to college. Fisher's House,
which provides housing for families
with loved ones at Veterans Admin-
istration hospitals, will receive
$250,000, the White House said
Thursday. And the Clinton-Bush
Haiti Fund, for which two former
presidents are raising money to
rebuild earthquake-ravaged Haiti,
will receive $200,000.
"These organizations do extraor-
dinary work in the United States
and abroad helping students, veter-
ans and countless others in need,"
Obama said in a statement. "I'm
proud to support their work."
Obama was chosen for the Nobel
award more for his aspirations and
approach than his accomplish-
ments thus far.
BAGHDAD, Iraq
Iraqi journalist dies
in military gunfire
U.S. troops opened fire on a car
in western Baghdad, killing an Iraqi
journalist and her husband, a police
official said yesterday.
Morgue officials confirmed the
deaths and said the bodies of Aseel
al-Obeidi and her husband were
riddled with bullets in Wednes-
day's shooting in the Tobchi neigh-
borhood.
AI-Obeidi worked for Dijla tele-
vision, an independent Baghdad
station that recently closed because
of financial problems.
The U.S. military said it was

investigating the killing of two
Iraqis during a joint patrol by
American and Iraqi troops in west-
ern Baghdad on Wednesday, but it
did not give any details or confirm
if that was the same shooting that
involved the journalist and her hus-
band.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
Kidnapped aid
workers released
Kidnappers have freed two
Swiss women snatched off the
streets of Haiti's capital and held
for five days, officials said yester-
day.
It is the first reported kid-
napping since Haiti suffered a
magnitude-7 earthquake with
catastrophic damage on Jan. 12.
More than 5,000 prisoners fled
jails that collapsed or were dam-
aged in the temblor. Only about
200 have been captured.
Doctors Without Borders con-
firmed the kidnapping. Agency
spokesman Michel Peremans
said the victims were released
Wednesday night. He would not
say if a ransom was paid.
Doctors Without Borders is one
of hundreds of international aid
agencies that have flooded into
Haiti to help.
A security alert sent to non-
governmental agencies, obtained
by The Associated Press, said the
0 two were Swiss women working
for the France-based agency.

CARLOS OSORIO/AP
Ex-Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick addresses the media outside the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice in Detroit on Tuesday.
Former Detroit mayor
Kilpatrick owes $ 870K

Judge calls for
short restitution
hearing
DETROIT (AP) - An ongoing
restitution battle between ex-
Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick
and prosecutors may come down
to a final one- or two-day hearing
in Wayne County Circuit Court.
Kilpatrick, his attorneys or
prosecutors have either appeared
or filed motions on the issue, or
judges have made rulings in the
matter, on at least nine occasions
since Feb. 10.
But on Thursday, Circuit Court
Presiding Judge Timothy Kenny
made it clear that the proceed-
ings should be nearing an end
with a March 24 probation viola-
tion hearing.
"I do think ... both sides need to
have the opportunity to fairly and
completely litigate the issues,"
Kenny said. "It really should be
done swiftly and conclusively."
Defense attorney Michael
Allan Schwartz said he would
need about a day to present his
case, while prosecutors expect to
use transcripts from earlier hear-
ings before Judge David Groner.
Kenny also on yesterday denied
Schwartz' appeal to disqualify
Groner over claims the judge was
biased against Kilpatrick and had

improper communications with
prosecutors on a bench warrant
charging the former mayor with
violating his probation.
Kenny's ruling was a "partial
victory," Kilpatrick spokesman
Mike Paul told reporters outside
the court building.
"What we were seeking all the
time was fairness, accountabil-
ity," Paul said. "And the judge
added something that was just
as important: 'swiftly.' And that's
what we feel we're going to have
now. Judge Groner, we feel that
he will deal with us in a more just
and accountable way."
Kilpatrick also was allowed to
return to his home outside Dallas
after spending the past two days
in Detroit.
The latest flurry of court
action followed a six-day resti-
tution hearing that started in
October and ended in January
when Groner ordered Kilpatrick
to make two lump sum payments
of $79,011 and $240,000 toward
restitution.
On Feb. 10, Kilpatrick's law-
yers said he was having trouble
coming up with the first payment
that was due Feb. 19 and filed an
emergency motion with Groner
asking the judge to reconsider.
Six days later, Groner ruled he
would not consider the order.
A bench warrant was issued
for Kilpatrick's arrest when he

failed to pay the full amount.
Defense attorneys went to the
state Appeals Court which post-
poned a brobation violation
arraignment, but later denied a
request to stay Groner's restitu-
tion payment order.
Kilpatrick was arraigned Tues-
day and kept free on a $10,000
personal bond.
Kilpatrick agreed to pay the
city $1 million in restitution fol-
lowing pleas in 2008 to two
criminal cases tied to a text-mes-
saging sex scandal involving a
former aide.
He resigned as mayor, spent
99 days in jail and took a job as a
computer software salesman for
Texas-based Covisint after his
release in February 2009.
Prosecutors accused Kilpat-
rick last year of not being hon-
est about his finances and those
of his wife, Carlita. They proved
during earlier restitution hear-
ings that tens of thousands of
dollars were moved from bank

Settlement offer
awaits approval of
judge, workers
NEW YORK (AP) - After years
of fighting in court, lawyers rep-
resenting the city, construction
companies and more than 10,000
ground zero rescue and recovery
workers have agreed to a settle-
ment that could pay up to $657.5
million to responders sickened
hy dust from cle destroyed World
Trade Center.
Thesettlementwas announced
yesterday evening by the WTC
Captive Insurance Co., a spe-
cial entity established to indem-
nify the city and its contractors
against potential legal action as
they moved to clean up the site
after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror
attacks.
The deal, which still must
be approved by a judge and the
workers themselves, would make
the city and other companies
represented by the insurer liable
for a minimum of $575 million,
with more money available to the
sick if certain conditions are met.
Most if not all of the money
would come out of a $1 billion
grant from the Federal Emergen-
cy Management Agency.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg
called the settlement "a fair and
reasonable resolution to a com-
plex set of circumstances."
"The resolution of the World
Trade Center litigation will allow
the first responders and workers
to be compensated for injuries
suffered following their work at
Ground Zero," Bloomberg said in
a statement.

Marc Bern, a senior partner
with the law firm Worby, Groner,
Edelman & Napoli, Bern LLP,
which negotiated the deal, said it
was "a good settlement."
"We are gratified that these
heroic men and women who
performed their duties with-
out consideration of the health
implications will finally receive
just compensation for their pain
and suffering, lost wages, medi-
cal and other expenses, as the
U.S. Congress intended when it
appropriated this money," he said
in a statement.
Workers who wish to par-
ticipate in the settlement would
need to prove they had been
at the World Trade Center site
or other facilities that handled
debris. They also would have to
turn over medical records and
provide other information aimed
at weeding out fraudulent or
dubious claims.
For the settlement to be
enforced, 95 percent of the work-
ers would need to agree to be
bound by its terms.
The agreement comes with
just two months to go until the
first trials are to begin in the
case. Thousands of police offi-
cers, firefighters and construc-
tion workers who put in time at
the 16-acre site in lower Man-
hattan had filed lawsuits against
the city, claiming it sent them to
ground zero without proper pro-
tective equipment.
Many of those workers now
claim to have fallen ill. A major-
ity complained of a respiratory
problem similar to asthma, but
the suits also sought damages for
hundreds of other types of ail-
ments, including cancer.

accounts in ms name to his wite'

7C

accounts and argued some of that
should go toward restitution.
Groner agreed and ordered the
two large lump sum payments, in
addition to the $3,000 monthly
payments Kilpatrick already is
making.
On Tuesday, Kilpatrick told
reporters that he owed about
$870,000 in restitution.

Profs should post course information online early
W hile ratemyprofessor.com might not be the most
credible source of information about courses and
professors at the University, it's usually the only
place students can go for information. But recently, the LSA Stu-
dent Government passed a resolution requesting that instructors
make course syllabi available to students online during regis-
tration. This would provide students with a crucial resource to
inform their expectations about the classes they sign up for and
prepare them to face the semester. Professors should quickly
embrace the practice of putting syllabi up early, and the Senate
Advisory Committee on University Affairs - the faculty's lead-
ing governing body - should make it official policy.

Speak up, pro-choicers

On Monday, the Daily reported on LSA-
SG's efforts, previously undertaken by
the Michigan Student Assembly, to urge
University professors to post course syl-
labi online at the time of class registration.
According to Timothy McKay, director of
the LSA Honors Program, most SACUA
members are in support of this proposi-
tion. But John Lin - the chair of MSA's
Academic Affairs Commission and a mem-
ber of SACUA's Academic Affairs Advisory
Committee - noted that it will likely take a
couple of semesters for the resolution to be
implemented at the University.
Posting syllabi online early would be
extremely beneficial to University students
who are planning course loads. Course
descriptions tend to be vague and fail to
provide a complete picture of the course's
content, rigor and the time commitment
required. Providing syllabiearlywillincrease
students' understanding of the courses
and allow them to choose ones they know
they can manage. Being able to make more
informed selections of courses will help stu-
dents get the most out of their education by
allowing them to focus on their studies and
take courses that supplement their concen-
tration. And when students enter a class fully
prepared for its rigor, they will be less likely
to drop the course. This would help stabilize
the hectic early-semester lives of University

students. The success of similarly modeled
initiatives at universities around the coun-
try, like Princeton University and Harvard
University, shows that making syllabi more
accessible can work at the University.
Professors should view transparency
in their courses as a duty to the students.
With a minimal amount of time and effort,
they can make progress in improving both
student participation and academic per-
formance by giving students additional
information so they can choose the right
courses. Even posting an old copy of a syl-
labus if a current version isn't available
would provide a more in depth description
of what a course offers and entails. Minor
changes could always be made to the syl-
labus after registration.
SACUA could also be a powerful force in
advancing this proposal. With encourage-
ment from the student body and its rep-
resentative parties, it should urge faculty
members to commit to its implementation.
LSA-SG and MSA have been pushing pro-
fessors toward this initiative, but SACUA
should follow the LSA-SG resolution with an
official policy.
Making course syllabi available at the time
of registration will allow students to make
informed decisions about their course loads
and get the most from their education - if
SACUA takes action.

Last week, just as I had settled
into my spring break-induced
state of sedation, a New York
Times article jolted
me into a panic that
I thoughtIwouldn't
see until finals.
The article, 4
entitled "ToaCourt
Blacks, Foes of
Abortion Make
Racial Case,"
explained that
Georgia Right to LIBBY
Life, Georgia's larg-
est anti-abortion ASHTON
organization, is
undergoing a cam-
paign across the
state to attract black people to the
anti-abortion movement and reduce
the disproportionate number of black
women who have abortions. The orga-
nization has hired a black woman as
their minority outreach staff member,
whose responsibilities include trav-
eling to black churches and colleges,
spreading the message "that abortion
is the primary tool in a decades-old
conspiracy to kill off blacks."
As a part of the campaign to increase
support for their organization among
the black community, the group has
paid for 80 billboards throughout
Atlanta that read "Black children are
an endangered species," and feature
the link to their website.
The recruiting tactics of this organi-
zation exemplify the absence of ratio-
nality - and even morality - from
the motivating forces behind the anti-
abortion movement. This campaign in
Georgia is rooted in a fundamentally
religious conviction that a woman's
reproductive capacity to bring poten-
tial human life to fruition is more
sacred than her rights as a person of
moral agency to control whether or not
she utilizes this capacity.
In order to generate enough sup-
port to make policy consistent with
this religious conviction, anti-abortion
activists (who are primarily white) are
using to their advantage the excep-

tional and inexcusable instances where
abortion has been regarded as a means
to achieve the racist ideal of a smaller
black population.
The impact these anti-abortionists
have had on Markita Eddy, a Morris
Brown College sophomore who was
quoted in the Times article as saying
she was pro-choice until she watched
"Maafa 21"- adocumentary that sup-
ports the idea that abortion is a rac-
ist conspiracy - has instilled in me a
sense of urgency to communicate the
truth of the pro-choice argument.
Those fighting for the criminaliza-
tion of abortion seem tobe much more
energized and vocal than those who
believe the issue of abortion should stay
as it is - a matter of choice. I, as some-
one who identifies with the latter group,
fear that if we don't begin to engage the
opposition, our silence will imply alack
of argument or a lack of certainty.
The argument is this: the female bio-
logical capacity to reproduce does not
legally (nor, in my opinion, morally)
commit any woman to reproducing.
The killing of an innocent person is
wrong. However, abortion is not the
killing of an innocent person because,
although an embryo does mark the
beginning of biological human life, it is
not yet a person.
Mary Anne Warren, a philosopher
most noted for her work on the ques-
tion of abortion, created a rough list
of criteria to determine personhood
- or what about "human life" consti-
tutes its belonging to the moral com-
munity. She said that a person must
have at least some of these five crite-
ria: consciousness and the capacity to
feel pain, reasoning, voluntary activ-
ity, the capacity to communicate (in
any way) and self-awareness.
A fetus, in the first trimester, has
none of these.
One might argue that a first-trimes-
ter fetus would eventually become a
person, in the moral sense, if left alone.
However, in order to develop, that fetus
cannot be left alone - it must receive
support and nourishment from the
woman carrying it.

Until a fetus develops to a point of
personhood, it only represents poten-
tial - the same potential that exists
virtually everywhere and only some-
times results in the emergence of a
person. Abortion, contraception, and
my failure to have sex with every virile
man Iencounter are all the same denial
of potetntial personhood.
A woman is more
than her capacity
to reproduce.
All women, from puberty to meno-
pause, have the potential for the devel-
opment of personhood. However, our
worth and our rights, as people, extend
beyond our reproductive function. A
woman is more than her uterus and
deserves to be regarded by the govern-
ment as more.
I fear that if supporters of the pro-
choice movement remain reluctant to
challenge anti-abortionists for fear
of offending their religious beliefs or
failing to change their minds, cam-
paigns like the one in Georgia will
successfully distort the reality of the
abortion debate and make the imper-
missible seem permissible. I urge the
majority of the country, which is made
up of people who believe abortion
should be legal in all, some or a few
cases, to make its voice heard - begin-
ning here in Ann Arbor.
If my framing of the pro-choice
argument (as Iunderstand it) has reso-
nated with you, talk to your friends
about it. As University students liv-
ing and learning in a community that
values the pursuit of truth, we have a
responsibility to engage in sometimes
uncomfortable dialogue - even if it
interrupts your vacation.

Substance over symbolism

In 1925, an affluent black man, Dr. Ossian
Sweet, moved with his family into a white
neighborhood in Detroit, and their house was
subsequently mobbed. By the end of the night,
a white man had been shot and the entire Sweet
family was arrested. Thanks to the help of the
NAACP and the renowned lawyer, Clarence
Darrow, the Sweets were acquitted in a trium-
phant victory for civil rights. The history of the
Sweet case is well documented in Kevin Boyle's
"Arc of Justice: A Saga of Race, Civil Rights, and
Murder in the Jazz Age".
At the end of the book, the author notes that
the fight for desegregated neighborhoods has
been put on hold since the Civil Rights era, and
that asa result, Detroit is currently the most seg-
regated city in the country. However, this point
was likely lost on many readers because of the
grandiose nature of the Sweets' story.
In conversations relating to civil rights and
racial equality, certain milestones are frequently
referenced to show the advancements our coun-
try has made. The Sweet case might not be a very
well-known example, but Brownv. Board of Edu-
cation is another example. The election of Barack
Obama as our first black president is one as well.
While these events are all important, their sym-
bolic significance in the minds of many Ameri-
cans tends to outweigh their practical effects. As
a result, their legacies overshadow current civil
rights problems that often go unmentioned.
Take Brown, for instance. The case often sym-
bolizes the end of de jure segregation in public
schools, even though racial segregation result-
ing from resource inequality between school
districts remains a huge problem. In her column
this Wednesday, Brittany Smith voiced her frus-
tration with the racial disparities in American
schools and with the policy makers who are not
addressing the problem (Education shouldn't be a
crapshoot, 03/10/2010).
I'm somewhat hopeful that this lack of atten-
tion will change.- Obama stated in his State of
the Union address that education reform will
become a major project for his administration.
But I largely agree with Smith. It seems very
possible that education policy will be over-
shadowed by talks about the economy and the
environment in the near future. And even if

education becomes the next health care debate,
I have no reason to believe that the Demo-
crats won't side step the race issue, as they've
been doing since President Lyndon B. Johnson
signed the Civil Rights Act.
Regardless, Brown will always be held on a
pedestal to symbolize progress in racial equal-
ity in schools. In his book "Silent Covenants:
Brown v. Board of Education and the Unfulfilled
Hopes for Racial Reform," Derrick Bell refers
to the Yale University Commencement 2002
when lawyer Robert L. Carter received an hon-
orary degree, largely for his work on the Brown
case. As the primarily white audience burst into
applause, Bell hesitated to join, thinking about
the modern state of our education system and
how little it seems like Brown actually contrib-
uted towards significant progress.
Additionally, the way Brown is taught in pri-
mary and secondary education seriously over-
emphasizes the significance of the case. Students
are frequently taught that Brown was a unani-
mous decision. While this is true, the implication
is that there were no feelings of dissent among
the justices. In "From Jim Crow to Civil Rights :
The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial
Equality," historian Michael Klarman shows
that this is not true, as the justices who contem-
plated dissent were convinced otherwise to min-
imize public resistance to the decision. Students
are also rarely taught about Brown II, the follow-
up case that severely impeded the ability of state
governments to enforce the decision.
Arguments that rely on the symbolic impor-
tance of an event are not limited to race issues
- a few weeks ago the Daily argued that the
university should adopt a policy of gender-
neutral language because it would be symboli-
cally important (He/she/ze, 02/17/2010). But the
subject is particularly relevant to racial issues
because it has become customary in politics
to talk about the milestones, and nothing else.
It's a mistake for us to only recognize the mile-
stones, because they usually divert our atten-
tion away from ongoing problems. But talking
about issues related to race is contentious, so
politicians simply don't.

Award-winning letdown

So, how was your break? Mine
was good too. I went to Mexico.
Why I chose to go to Mexico, I
don't know. I have
the complexion of
a leprechaun and
can only sit in the
sun for five min-
utes before I start
wheezing and turn-
ing into a bright- -
red, blistered,
version of the Hulk.
This may be why LINCOLN
I'm probably the BOEHM
only person who
went to Mexico for
spring break and
recounted "watching the Oscars" as
the highlight of the trip.
I don't know why I get so excited
for the Academy Awards each year
because I always leave each viewing
disappointed. But despite my peren-
nial disappointment with the Oscars,
I'm always excited to watch them.
For one reason or another, the Oscars
have some social importance, and for
the life of me, I don't know why that
is. It was this burning question that
led me to watch this year's telecast
with a critical eye.
My favorite parts of the Oscars are
the performance art aspects of the
show. When someone wins an award,
all eyes turn to them, and being actors
they instinctively start playing a role.
For example: Roberto Benigni stand-
ing on the chair after winning his
award for "Life Is Beautiful" was per-
formance art. Angelina Jolie making
out with her brother after winning her
Oscar was weirdly arousing, but more
importantly, performance art.
These are the moments I love to
see, and sadly there was only one win-
ner who lived up to the bill: Mo'Nique.
Mo'Nique took about seven minutes to
get from her seat in the front row to the

stage. One thing I didn't understand
was why everyone gave her a standing
ovation like she was Martin Scorsese.
I mean, sure, I thought she was great
as Jamiqua in "Soul Plane" and there's
no question the Academy snubbed her
landmark performance as Jazmin Bilt-
more in "Phat Girlz" but did she really
deserve the standing ovation?
And the first thing that came out
of her mouth was a darting insult to
everyone who had been nominated in
her category, and every prior Oscar
winner: "I would like to thank the
Academy, for showing that it can be
about the performance, and not the
politics." She was essentially saying
that she is the first person to win an
Academy Award that actually deserved
it. Ballsy, Mo'Nique.
Next came the John Hughes memo-
riam. I loved this because they brought
out some of the legendary and incred-
ibly creepy child-actors that John
Hughes made famous. Macauley
Culkin looked like a meth addict (no
shock there) but more importantly
Judd Nelson looked like astoned Teddy
Roosevelt. I loved it.
Then came the incredibly weird
montage of people who had died dur-
ing the past year; or, as I call it, the
Debbie Downer Lifetime Achievement
Award. Right after seeing Star Trek's
makeup artist cry out ofhappiness, and
about 25 unnecessary cuts to George
Clooney (who was sporting a mullet)
we have the montage of dead people to
thwart whatever momentum had been
built. And by the way, Academy, you
forgot Farrah Fawcett! Farrah Faw-
cett, whose slow death garnered hun-
dreds of hours of media coverage, was
snubbed. Not only did she get screwed
over when Michael Jackson died on
the same day as her, now she's getting
snubbed by the Academy. On a separate
note, I was reallyhopingthat JeffGold-
blum would make it into the montage;

and then we'd have a great cut to him
sitting in the audience with a look of
confusion on his face. Ugh. If only.
Despite the Oscars'
pointlessness, I just
can't look away.

0

Lastly, why it was necessary for
Kathryn Bigelow, the director of
"The Hurt Locker" to be seated right
in front of her ex-husband James
Cameron and his new wife, I don't
know. Whenever they'd cut to Kath-
ryn Bigelow we'd see the tiny head of
James Cameron's new wife, glaring
at her. Awkward. And when Bigelow
won the award for Best Director, I was
frankly a little upset that she didn't
thank her husband, Deuce Bigelow
Male Gigolo. For those of you keeping
score at home, the Oscar snubs now
include Farrah Fawcett, Jeff Gold-
blum and, most importantly, the ever-
so-sensitive Rob Schneider.
At first I was thinking that maybe
people just love the Oscars because
they love movies. That makes sense.
But having just wasted four hours
watching them, I can tell you that I
know more about George Clooney's
complexion than I do any of the films
that were up for awards. The Oscars
have just as much to do with great
filmmaking as Mo'Nique does. But,
will someone please tell me why I
can't wait for next year's Academy
Awards? Is this what it's like being
addicted to drugs? I should have
asked Macauley Culkin.

Susan Zielinski, manag-

initiative - a part of the Univer-

in an e-mail interview that the
most pressing transportation
challenges are in urban areas

Overcrowding in cities poses a
challenge for the transportation
industry,' as it leads to problems
like congestion, social inequity
and commuting, according to

"Divestment or any talk of
divestment would do nothing to
solve the conflict in the region,"
he said.
The U-M Dearborn student
government passed similar reso-
lutions in 2005 and 2006, but
according to David Skrbina, a
lecturer of philosophy and fac-
ulty advisor to the Arab Student
Union at U-M Dearborn, the
University didn't follow through
with the resolutions because
they weren't in accordance with
the regents' rules on student
activism.
Skrbina said instead of asking
the Board of Regents to form an
investigative advisory commit-
tee on the issue, the previous
resolutions "went directly to
divestment."
He added that students passed
the current resolution in an
attempt to pressure the Universi-
ty to withdraw its financial sup-
port from companies involved in
the conflict.
Though she hasn't comment-
ed on it recently, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
said in a statement in 2002
that the University wouldn't be
divesting.
"I do not support divestment,"
Coleman said in the statement.

which someone would be able
to enter their origin and desti-
nation into their computer or

past instances in which the Uni-
versity divested - in 1978 to pro-
test South African apartheid and
in 2000 from tobacco stocks -
were consequences of sustained
support for the issues from the
campus community.
Both Berry and Skrbina are
currently working to raise cam-
pus awareness and interest in the
issue of divestment. Recently,
the Arab Student Union held a
week-long series of events focus-
ing on issues of divestment and
the realities for Palestinians
involved in the Israeli-Palestin-
ian conflict.
Berry said though awareness
of the conflict has come with the
large number of Arab Americans
on Dearborn's campus, he does
not believe that this resolution is
anti-semitic.
"The issue isn't whether or not
we should divest from Israel," he
said. "The issue is whether or not
we should divest from the killing
of innocent people," he said.
Berry added that he is work-

students on Dearborn's campuss

and the Jewish Voice for Peace.
In addition, Berry said he

charges "very seriously."
"We are determined to have a
program that meets all_ the rules
and regulations and does it in the
right way. Nobody wants to not do
it in the right way."
However, Coleman made it
clear that there is more left in the
process and that she is focused on
"finding out what the issues are
and then addressing the issues in
the appropriate way."
"I think we just have to get
through the process. It's very
important," Coleman said.
In further discussion with one
of the students at the event, Cole-
man told the audience she believes
the football program is still in good
standing.
"We do have a good reputa-

in the future is very important,"
Coleman said.
COLEMAN RESPONDS TO
STUDENT COMPLAINTS
ABOUT UNIVERSITY DINING
At the event, students also
expressed mixed opinions about
the quality of the food served in
the dining halls and the selection
of food that is available with a few
students saying they believe they
are paying too much for substan-
dard food.
Linda Newman, director of Uni-
versity Housing, said the Univer-
sity tries to make sure there is a
wide variety of quality food at all
dining halls on campus. She added
that because of the plethora of food
available, and because so much
goes into the making of the food,
prices are higher than at some res-
taurants.
"Granted, in this kind of envi-
ronment it will be more than the
price you will pay for the price of
a hamburger at McDonalds," New-
man said. "But there is a lot more

burger than there is at McDon-
alds."
Coleman encouraged students
to share any issues they have with
the dining halls, adding that the
University is committed to pro-
viding the best experience for
diners.
"We continue to try and provide
the best we can for the price. We
are not making a profit on the food
service, believe me," Coleman said.
Students also expressed con-
cern about the amount of food that
is wasted in the dining halls each
day.
Dan Schleh, associate director
of Residential Dining Services,
said the University always tries to
reduce the amount of waste.
Schleh said previously the din-
ing hall in Markley Residence Hall
tried to go without trays to reduce
waste, but students didn't like it,
adding that in about two weeks the
East Quadrangle Residence Hall
dining hall will experiment with
not using meal trays.
"I've visited campuses where
they've done it," he told students.
"I've talked to the director at times
and I've talked to the students and
I asked them how they like it. It's
kind of a mixed bag. Some students
said they really liked it and others
say,'I now have to make three trips
to get (food). So it's kind of inter-
esting, but we are trying it."
Another student asked Coleman
about the possibility of moving
the nutritional facts on each menu
option - which are currently
placed directly over the dishes as
their served - away from the buf-
fet line.
The student, who is recovering
from an eating disorder, said it can
be difficult for individuals to take
food, when they see the amount of
calories in each dish.
Schleh said the University was
already in the process of making
this change. He said computers
displaying nutritional facts for all
menu items will soon be placed in
Parker added that every suite
purchased after the 70 percent sale
target has been reached would pro-
vide additional money for funding
other projects in the athletic depart-
ment.
Fewer than 20 of the suite buyers,
Parker said, are "true corporate enti-
ties," and that the majority of suites
has been purchased by individual
consumers. He added that many of
the individual as well as corporate
buyers, like Dow Chemical and DTE
Energy, have had a long-standing
history with the University.
"It has not been, whatI think alot
of people might have anticipated, as
just a lot of companies that have had

dining halls across campus.
COLEMAN TALKS CAMPUS-
WIDE SMOKING BAN
Students also expressed concern
regarding the campus-wide smok-
ing ban - set to go into effect in
July 2011 - to Coleman. One stu-
dent, who has attended previous
fireside chats, questioned Coleman
extensively on the topic and ada-
mantly protested the ban.
Coleman said a taskforce dedi-
cated to the topic, which is made
up of both smokers and nonsmok-
ers, might designate certain areas
on campus for people to smoke
in, but that the ban is moving for-
ward.
"They have discussed the issue
of whether or not they should
create some spaces that would
be a transition," Coleman said.
"We don't want to have these, I
think, forever, but as transition
spaces where people could go and
smoke."
The proposed ban has rubbed
some on campus the wrong way,
including the student who raised
the topic at the fireside chat.
During the event, the student
asked Coleman if she believed
unhealthy food - like cheese-
burgers and pizza - should simi-
larly be banned from dining halls
on campus to make students lead
healthier lives.
"We need to ban the choice or
they're going to make that bad
decision," the student said sarcas-
tically, playing off comments other
students made about the quality of
food in University dining halls.
In an interview after the event,
Coleman said she would encourage
any students who have an inter-
est in the impending smoking ban
to speak to the task force and give
their opinion.
"We are moving," she said.
"We've made the decision to move
on this and we are going to try to
satisfy people's legitimate con-
cerns."
no experience with the institution,"
Parker said.
And, while the economic climate
has been a factor in suite sales, Park-
er said he doesn't believe the foot-
ball team's record over the past two
years has affected sales.
"Most people that we've talked
to, they've invested in Michigan
football for years and they realize,
like all things in life, there are points
in time where its cyclical and there's
going to be some experiences that
are kind of a downturn," Parker
said. "So, they're in it for the long
term. They aren't thinking about
the course of two seasons and wins
and losses."

VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Some of you might be dabbling in a
secret, forbidden love affair. Or maybe a
secret for other reasons. You're playing
your cards close to your chest.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Yams have hots of eegy for group

cess. Now you are encouraged!
SAGITTARIUS

happy about this.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Sit down with others to discuss how to
share what must be divided - perhaps
an inheritance or a specific amount of
money. Differing opinions will soon
reach a consensus.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
Don't be annoyed with others, espe-
cially partners and close friends. Seek
ways to make the peace. It takes a lot of
energy to stay angry. Harmony makes
for happiness.
PISCES
(Feb. 19 to March 20)
it's easy toget a lot done now because
you have the motivation and the energy
to follow through on whatever you do.
Capitalize on this! Get as much done as

'Brooklyn's Finest' wants
to be 'The Wire' but ends
up a bloody mess
By IMRAN SYED
Daily Arts Writer
In an interview on "The Colbert Report"
last week, actor Don Cheadle said his new
film, "Brooklyn's Finest,"
was shot in a part of East
Brooklyn so cut off from
the glitz of New York City Brooklyn's
that he doubted the resi-
dents of that neighbor- fines
hood had ever seen a film At Qualityl6
crew before. and Showcase
Whether or not that's Overture
true, one thing's for cer-
tain: No matter how cut
off those folks may be, "Brooklyn's Finest"
is a film even they have seen countless times
before.
Embodying one of three disparate sto-
rylines in the film, Cheadle ("Ocean's Thir-

teen") plays Tango, a trusted lieutenant of
drug kingpin Caz (Wesley Snipes, "Blade:
Trinity"). While Caz and his crew trust
Tango like a brother, he happens to be an
undercover cop, working to get Caz's drug
organization shut down.
Meanwhile, in another plotline, Ethan
Hawke ("Before the Devil Knows You're
Dead") plays a righteous cop forced to steal
from drug dealers to take care of his fam-
ily. Finally, Richard Gere ("Amelia") plays a
depressed, aging police officer who hasn't .
cared about the job in years, but suddenly
finds his emotions awakened as he works to
break up a prostitution ring.
While the film has plenty of guns, drugs
and sex, it's annoyingly clear from the very
first scene that it seeks to be something
greater. The deliberate, overwrought the-
atrical procession that unfolds across a
grueling 133 minutes seems to have been
intended as a film counterpart to "The
Wire." The several distinct storylines popu-
lated by the sprawl of intermittently inter-
esting characters show that the film sought
to be a gritty, enveloping character drama
that spans magnificently across genres and

endures in our memories as a transcendent
cinematic masterpiece.
Needless to say, it falls well short of
accomplishing anything of that nature.
More surprisingly, it fails even as a con-
ventional police drama, perhaps owing to
its desperation to achieve more. While all
the performances are solid - Cheadle and
Snipes especially - the persistent bland-
ness of the writing and direction simply
cannot be overcome.
All three storylines are propelled by one
cliche after another - too many to even
count - before converging predictably into
a bloody final sequence that achieves new
levels of miscalculation and confusion.
There are surprises to be sure, but none
of the cathartic relevance and emotional
depth of similar scenes in better movies
like "The Departed" or anything by Sidney
Lumet.
What we get from "Finest" is a fuming
hot mess in which who lives and who dies
seems decided not by what makes thematic
sense, but rather by who would look the
coolest walking toward the camera in slow
motion as the credits roll.

Two years of preparation will be
crammed into 24 hours starting at 5 p.m.
tonight. "One Day Run-
way," the brainchild
of director and Art & One Day
Design senior Amy R
Plouff, will bring togeth-
er two of her favorite Tomorrow
things: Basement Arts's at11 p.m.
24 Hour Theatre, an Walgreen
annual challenge to cre- Drama Center
ate four original short Free
plays in one day's time,
and Lifetime's fashion
competition "Project Runway."
Plouff's initially far-fetched idea to
bring together seven Art & Design stu-
dents for a faux reality TV show wasn't
fully realized until a $400 grant from
Arts at Michigan provided some much-
needed, financial backing. Once the
money issue was solved, finding enthusi-
astic participants including film, design
and acting majors was no problem at all.
The action will begin when the seven
designers are given $50 and an undis-
closed challenge to fulfill as the sun goes
down tonight.
The concept may be similar to "Project
Runway," but according to Plouff it does
have its differences.
"Instead of going downtown in
New York to buy fabric, we're going to
JoAnn's," she said.
Contestants will bring their purchased
materials back to the Walgreen Drama
Center where they will be supplied with
sewing machines and cutting desks in the
"Costume Lab." The room will not only
contain frantic designers, but also their
previously selected models, already mea-
sured and set for fitting.
Meanwhile, cameras will be rolling to
capture the insanity and insomnia.
Participant and Art & Design junior
Yonit Olshan said that during this time,
she will be forced to think "about things
like zippers or hems or how my model
will get in and out of my garment easily
- things I'm not used to thinking about.
"Even just staying on target all along
with my friends around and a camera
crew - things might just get crazy," she
added.
When the clock strikes 5 p.m. tomor-
row night, the contestants will have to
drop what they're doing and let their
stress subside until 11 p.m. During this
time the film will be edited and then pro-
jected as the first component of the show,
with the intention of presenting the "epi-
sode" before the live event.
Other components will include a judg-
ing by costume design and directing
professors, as well as the choosing of an
"audience favorite," decided by votes cast
during intermission.
Last but not least, the obligatory "con-
fessional" segment will take place live on
the set.

Plouff, for one, is looking forward to
the "shit-talking behind the confession-
als."
"I've always wanted to be that produc-
er that probes them (and says), 'Oh yeah,
what do you think about that outfit,' " she
said, admitting that she's a sucker for the
"drama" of reality TV.
The restrictions posed by the clock
and purse strings will certainly provide
an intriguing challenge, no matter how
experienced contestants are.
"I have made a wide variety of cos-
tumes and different garments through-
out my life, but I'm not sure how I will
react to designing and constructing
under such time and budget constraints,"
Olshan said.
Another contestant, Art & Design
junior Corey Davis, agreed with this sen-
timent, and plans to prepare accordingly.
"I'm pretty sure I'll be sleeping all of
Thursday and Friday so I don't pass out
in the middle of the challenge," he said.
For Plouff, this limited time span is
sure to test her stamina and will certainly
spark some memorable moments.
"I don't think I've experienced the
most enjoyable part," she said of her
approximately 730-day journey. "I think
that's going to be probably like the eigh-
teenth hour of being on energy drinks
and really excited and watching the
drama unfold."
'Project Runway'
meets 24 Hour
Theatre at Walgreen.
Art & Design senior and participant
June Saito isn't too phased by the con-
cept, saying that some days feel very sim-
ilar to "One Day Runway."
"Honestly, this is normal for us," she
explained. "Twenty-four hours in the
costume lab is like a normal night. We're
always in there working on projects,
though typically a full camera crew isn't
present."
Regardless, Saito plans on brushing up
on some technical aspects as well as cre-
ating a new iPod playlist.
"I'm trying to mentally prepare myself
for the chaos, so I think I might review
some sewing skills before Friday just to
be prepared," she said. "I also think (the
designers) are preparing to amp things up
a little for the camera so it's not just anoth-
er normal night singing along to Disney
soundtracks and Broadway musicals."
And rightfully so. Although the contest
is friendly in nature, there are prizes at
stake. Win or lose, the ultimate goal for
Plouff and the contestants is to put on an
entertaining and spontaneous live show
that is sure to contain some of Basement
Arts's well-known improvisation and
present a remarkably unique concept.

Indie but not innovative

By EMMA GASE
Daily Arts Writer
I remember the first time I heard Fleet
Foxes. I was in Austin, Texas, fresh from a
trip to the Mecca of all music stores, Water-
loo Records. Basking in the glow of my
purchases (Dr. Dog and Deerhunter among
them), I was especially excited about this
new band from Seattle that all my in-the-
know friends were raving about. I quickly
unwrapped the case (ignoring the lame
medieval-looking cover), slipped the CD
into the car stereo and waited.
The first song ("Sun It Rises") was kind
of nice. Good harmonies, cool atmospheric
vocals ... but wait. Something was off. I kept
listening. The second track ("White Winter
Hymnal") was a little more pop-oriented,
but this nagging thought was bursting to
escape my mind and Iecould hold it in no
longer.
Um, doesn't this guy's voice sound exact-
ly like Jim James of My Morning Jacket? Or
am I crazy? Wait, doesn't it also sound like
that guy from Band of Horses? And don't
these harmonies kind of (exactly) sound
like Crosby, Stills & Nash with a dash of
Fleetwood Mac? Haven't I heard this some-
where before?
I listened to the rest of the album, only
to be treated with the same medicine over
and over. Every dose was easy-to-swallow,
inoffensive Sunday morning music. Noth-
ing gripped me. -
Hearing Fleet Foxes and subsequently
witnessing the massive praise heaped on
their debut - the album gained extreme-
ly favorably reviews from Rolling Stone,
Entertainment Weekly, Pitchfork, Paste
Magazine and The Onion's A.V. Club - was
the final straw in a trend that has been irk-
ing me for some time. Recently a number
of bands have cropped up that are building
their careers on the established folk-rock/
Americana laorels of their reoeoessors.

These bands (e.g. Fleet Foxes, Band of
Horses, My Morning Jacket, Midlake) are
being lauded for a style they didn't actually
create.
Let me get something out of the way:
Copying others is natural. It's inevitable.
Musicians are influenced by other musi-
cians, and they attempt to create some-
thing that is part their own, part a nod to
their heroes. I have nothing against bands
that copy someone else's sound; my favorite
bands are all guilty of this. I only become
irritated when I hear people praising bands
like Fleet Foxes as "innovators" when
everything they do has been done before.
To me it's all about the songs, and I hear no
quirky personal touch, no innovation, noth-
ing to make me check this band out instead
of pulling Crosby, Stills & Nash or Rumours
back out of their well-worn sleeves.
Folk has been
around forever.
Sure, Fleet Foxes's Robin Pecknold has
great pipes beneath his bushy beard. But
play "White Winter Hymnal" or "Quiet
Houses" and then listen to CSN's "49 Bye-
Byes" or "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes," and tell me
which ones give you goose bumps. The CSN
songs are dripping with melody, charisma
and complexity; each song seems to contain.
half a dozen different songs. Fleet Foxes,
on the other hand, accumulate elements
of their predecessors and strategically mix
them with a tired nature theme for a calcu-
lated and recycled sound.
So much time has passed since artists
like CSN, The Band and Neil Young that
many of today's listeners don't remember
or even know about them. Let's face reality:
The modern hipster teen will read Pitch-
- I I .

fork, see that Fleet Foxes received a 9.0, buy
the album, find nothing wrong with it and
subsequently will consider it the bench-
mark of that style. They don't know any
better because they were never exposed to
the real innovators. Most people just don't
have the pedigree to see past these trendy
indie bands and appreciate the longevity of
albums like Music From Big Pink or After
the Gold Rush.
The same goes for bands like My Morn-
ing Jacket and Band of Horses. Both use the
same reverb-soaked high-pitched vocals
and loud Crazy Horse-esque guitars at
plodding rhythms to establish their sound.
Sometimes it seems as if these bands were
founded entirely on one edifying listen to
"Down by the River."
Nevertheless, Jim James owes it big to
Neil Young. I'm not saying every MMJ song
is sub-par to Young and Crazy Horse, but
even the best track on 2003's It Still Moves
(which is "Mahgeetah") could never cap-
ture the same stoner-rock perfection of Neil
Young's Everybody Knows This is Nowhere.
Band of Horses also does the whole dual-
guitar, mid-tempo rock, nasally vocal thing
very well, but it doesn't impress me. I see
what they're trying to do and I'll "admit at
times they serve up a semi-enjoyable tune,
but that's not enough. For the amount of
praise and hype that Band of Horses and
MMJ receive, it doesn't compel me to
shelve my Neil Young records. I've heard it
all before, and they just don't offer compa-
rable talent or personality.
So all of you musicians out there who
want instant cred in the folk-revivalist rock
world? Simply follow this recipe: One part
Whiny Falsetto Vocal, three parts Reverb
or Massive Echo Chamber, three parts Har-
mony, one part Sensitive Nature-themed
Band Name, one part Crazy Horse Gui-
tar Attack and three parts Scraggly Neck
Beard ...
And we'll see you at Bonnaroo!

A gleeful gather ing
of men's ensembles

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

It's a big year for Glee, and a memorable
time for three of the oldest collegiate men's
choruses in the coun-
try. This year marks Celebrating
the 150th anniversary 440 Years
of the University of
Michigan Men's Glee of Song
Club, as well as the Tomorrow
150th anniversary of
Harvard University's at 8 p.m.
Glee Club. This Satur- St.Thomas
day, the two will join the Apostle
together along with the ctohc
University of Virginia Ticketsfram $5
Glee Club in their pen-
ultimate concert of the semester.
The three choirs will perform a variety
of music, emphasizing different eras and
styles. American contemporary, Renais-
sance and folk songs are listed on the pro-
gram planned for Saturday. Performing
a wide selection of classical to popular
music, with an array of different languag-
es, the choirs plan to show off their ranges.
"I know firsthand that the UM Men's
Glee Club performs with extra energy and
excitement when there are peer groups
listening," said Paul Rardin, the director
of the Michigan Men's Glee Club. "I'm
quite sure that the other groups are the
same way, and we all will give peak per-
formances that evening."
A time for celebration, this year marks
several important milestones for these
esteemed choirs. The oldest continually
run student organization at the Univer-
sity, the Men's Glee Club is celebrating
150 years of history and fraternity. At the
same time that the Harvard Glee Club is
marking its 150th anniversary, it's also
honoring Jameson Marvin's final year as

conductor. Marvin is retiring after serv-
ing as director of choral activities at Har-
vard for 32 years.
"Jameson Marvin has built one of the
best Men's Glee Clubs in the country
across his 32 years," Rardin said. "His will
be giant shoes to fill."
The title of the event is "Celebrating 440
Years of Song," as Virginia's Glee Club is
also one of the oldest choruses in the coun-
try and the oldest musical organization at
the University of Virginia, founded nearly
140 years ago. But the main reason the Uni-
versity of Virginia Glee Club is making the
trip to Ann Arbor is to welcome its new
president: The University of Michigan's
current provost, Teresa Sullivan.
"For them it's a concert of meeting and
welcoming Dr. Sullivan to their students
and sound," Rardin said.
The University of Michigan Men's Glee
Club only has one performance left this
year after the March 13 event: the official
A meeting of men's

150th anniversary celebration on April 10.
This weekend's quadruple celebration is
one of the last opportunities of the semes-
ter to hear them, along with the added
bonus of hearing other illustrious colle-
giate choirs.
"It's very rare for three men's choirs
to converge on the same city on the same
day," Rardin said. "It's a wonderful oppor-
tunity for allof us to see, hear and learn
from three different ensembles."

Fuck battle of the bands. This is battle of the beard,

Brotherly love in'Tucson'.

Child actors carry FOX's
latest comedy series with
emotion and absurdity
By JAMIE BLOCK
ManagingArtsEditor
FOX has taken it upon itself to answer histo-
ry's most burning question: What would happen
if Jack Black adopted the kids
from "Malcolm in the Middle" *
and moved to Arizona? While
that may not be the exact plot Sons of
of "Sons of Tucson," it's pretty
damn close. But here's the Tucson
thing: It actually works. Sundays at
Tyler Labine ("Reaper") is 9:30 p.m.
our Jack Black wannabe, tak-F
ing on the role of Ron Snuffkin, FOX
a slightly overweight, washed-
up loser who lives in his car. He's approached
by the Gunderson children, three incredibly
rich, orphaned kids who secretly live on their
own in a suburban Tucson home. The trio pays

Snuffkin to pose as their father so they can
enroll in school. As the kids struggle to avoid
being found out and sent into foster care, they
broker a deal with the desperate Snuffkin, giv-
ing him a weekly stipend and room and board
in exchange for him posing as their father on an
as-needed basis.
While Labine is technically the star of the
show, he just seems along for the ride. His act-
ing is certainly up to par, but his character is
the stereotype of a low-brow slob, giving him
few opportunities to shine in an original way.
Snuffkin's requisite heartwarming moments as
a father figure, though, are actually aided by this,
as he manages to retain his slovenliness even in
his noblest actions.
It's really the children who make the series
shine. They take the main trio from "Malcolm in
the Middle" and give each character an upgrade,
adding wit, charm and a whole lot of love.
There's the youngest Gunderson, eight-year
old Robby (newcomer Benjamin Stockham), who
is crazy, loud and often shockingly diabolical.
And while he's certainly not the first rambunc-
tious, angry child we've seen on the small screen,
he's one of the mostendearing, and one of the sad-

dest. He's ascaredkidwho'supsettobe alone and
is just looking for someone to look up to. Robby
harbors an incredible resentment toward adults,
so he takes it out on every adult close to him. And
Stockham is able to make this motivation clear
without the show ever mentioning it overtly.
Then there's the middle child, 11-year-old
Gary (newcomer Frank Dolce), who is smart
and mature to the point of absurdity, just like
Frankie Muniz's Malcolm. But while Malcolm
was motivated to escape his family, Gary's moti-
vation is to keep everyone safe and together. For
God's sake, the kid made sure they all got signed
up for school. But more than anything, Gary is a
stress ball, going so far as to buy a heart moni-
tor at ayard sale to ensure he stays healthy under
pressure. Dolce pulls the character off perfectly.
Sometimes it's hard to remember he's a child, not
a vertically challenged adult who shops at Gap
Rids.
Thirteen-year-old Brandon Gunderson (new-
comer Matthew Levy) is the oldest of the three,
though Gary is undeniably the leader. While
Brandon has some of the bullyish, slightly oblivi-
ous qualities of Reese from "Malcolm," once
again his motives are far more endearing. Bran-
don puts up flyers of Gary saying "Whatup, slut?"
not to mock Gary, but to give him a chance to
reinvent himself as a fun-loving guy. Brandon
seems the most aloof to the trio's plight, but still
fulfills the role of morale booster.
This trifecta of novice actors is supremely
entertaining and extremely talented. And the
Gunderson characters make for great televi-
sion; they're just weird enough to allow for some
absurd plots, but still driven by brotherly love.
"Sons of Tucson" manages to combine the crazy
antics we see in the "Home Alone" movies and in
"My Name is Earl," then make them legitimately
heart-warming and witty.
The show would probably be better with-
out Snuffkin. He only shines when he's with
the kids, and the scenes without them drag on
tediously and for far too long. But even thatslob
Snuffkin can't completely mess up the magic
of the Gunderson children. Hopefully when
the dust clears in Tucson, the trio of aspiring
actors will find a chance to have the spotlight
on themselves.

"You are no son of Tucson!'

Putting scriptures on, display

By BRAD SANDERS
Daily Arts Writer
Have you ever wondered what is
actually over the rainbow? While
everyone's familiar with the popu-
lar song "Over the Rainbow" and
the question
it poses, many A
don't know
who actually Alen
composed the T
Broadway hit. Todayat5 p.m.
Walter Frisch, Burton Memoral
a professor
of music at
Columbia University, will be hold-
ing a lecture this Friday at 5 p.m.
in the Burton Memorial Tower
discussing the complex works of
Harold Arlen, the composer of the
famous tune.
Like most people, Frisch was
introduced to Arlen while watch-
ing "The Wizard of Oz." However,
his curiosity took him a step fur-
ther into examining the compos-
er's lesser-known pieces.
"I had been looking through the
works that had been made by the
great masters of that time, such as
Richard Rogers, and was drawn in
by the qualities of Arlen's music,"
Frisch said. "I find his songs very
expressive and moving."
"The song forms he uses often
transcend the standard form, as
he's frequently interested in lon-
ger structures that keep unfolding.
The way he approaches this genre
really gives him the quality of what
we might think of as an art song,
and there's a kind of completeness
and richness that is satisfying to
listen to," he added.
In addition to the form of Arlen's
music, Frisch is interested in the
songs' key changes, hinting at their
novelty.
"There's a song that he wrote
with Johnny Mercer, from a
show called 'St. Louis Woman,'
that starts in the key of B flat and
ends in A flat," Frisch explained.
"I think he just sort of follows his
instincts. He obviously couldbegin
and end in the same key, but he
loves to play with things like that."
Arlen drew inspiration from
specific types of music, as well as
his religious background, and con-
tinues to inspire various artists to
perform his songs.
"He denied he was just a blues
composer, but his harmonies are
very much tinged with blues scales
and notes," Frisch said. "Some
people say that since he was the

son of a cantor ina synagogue, that
his melodies and harmonies reflect
the Jewish cantorial style.
"'Over the Rainbow' served as a
comebackvehicle for JudyGarland,
and was also sung by famous sing-
ers such as Frank Sinatra and Bar-
bara Streisand, who specialized in
singinghis pieces," Frisch added.
With the popularity of some of
Arlen's songs, including "Stormy
Weather," it's strange no one really
recognizes his name.
"It puzzles me in some ways, but
I think it's because he never had a
hit show on Broadway. His work
was mostly showcased in films,"
Frisch said. "Hollywood compos-
ers never really got high status like
Broadway ones did, they were like
second-class citizens. His music
has seeped into the consciousness
of Americans, but for some reason
his name hasn't gone with it."
The lecture will include vari-
ous recordings of Arlen's as well as
other performers' works.
"I'll be talking a little bit about
how the song'A Sleepin' Bee' came
intobeingthat he wrote for amusi-
cal in 1954 when he was working
with a less experienced writer
named Truman Capote. He guided
this talented lyricist into recording
that song," Frisch explained.
Credit where
credit is due.
"My hope is to give an impres-
sion of this different side of Arlen
that people may not know about.
He was very unusual in the early
20th century in the sense that he
was such a complete and rounded
talent," he added.
Invited by the musicology
department, Frisch is excited to
speak at an institution that accel-
erated the integration of music as
a subject to be studied in Univer-
sities.
"The University of Michigan
was one of the first departments
of music in the country to study
American music as a scholarly sub-
ject," he said. "Many people who
have made their careers studying
music from the United States come
from the University, so this is a
great opportunity for me to share
research with people who have
been thinking about it for genera-
tions."

Religious texts have always had a widespread
impact, influencing our everyday customs, polit-
ical preferences and even our
concept of time. An annualA
exhibit at Hatcher Graduate
Library, "A History of the of the Bible
Bible from Ancient Papyri from Ancient
to King James," explores
these themes and makes Papyn to
them more accessible to the King James
public.
Running through March Through March
31 this year, "A History of 31,8:30 a.m.
the Bible" is showcased in to7 p.m.
the Audubon Room of the Hatcher Graduate
Hatcher Graduate Library. Library
The texts range from the
Epistles of Paul (circa 2nd
century C.E.) to a 1611 edition of the King
James Bible.
In addition to possessing great religious
significance, the displayed texts span a vari-
ety of subjects. The collection has served as a
resource for students studying art history, reli-
gion and the honors curriculum, Great Books,
but it also has other uses.
"One of the most important things (the exhib-
it) does besides telling the specific history of the
biblical text is it... talks about communication of

information," said Peggy Daub, director of the
Special Collections Library. "So in that sense
you go from the ancient Egyptian papyri to the
medieval manuscripts to the invention of ... the
movable type printing.
"It's a history of how text is transmitted from
one age to the next."
The exhibit has attracted not only University
members, but also the surrounding community.
"There are a lot of seminaries and theologi-
cal schools, so it is not just for the campus,"
Daub said. "In fact, a lot of groups come in from
churches and also people from different schools
where they are studyingtheology."
In addition to the evolution of the written
Bible, the collection features non-Biblical Chris-
tian texts, such as a Census Declaration from 119
C.E. and the Book of Enoch from 4th century C.E.
Daub also emphasized the importance of
enduring themes in the texts. There are no man-
uscripts in the exhibit created after 1611, but the
ideas they discuss are still relevant today.
"The fact that it stops at 1611 I think makes it
seem a little foreign to people," Daub said. "One
of the things we've tried to do in the labels and
text isto point out things that are eternal."
Correspondingly, the exhibit addresses last-
ing concerns such as the preservation of texts
and the conflicts between religion and politics.
"Most people would not have thought the act
of translation as a political act," Daub said. "The
fact thatnpeople were burned at the stake, people

were persecuted for taking it upon themselves
to put the Bible in their own language whether
it was Martin Luther in Germany or it was the
people in England ... is a surprise to many peo-
ple."
"A History of the Bible" features some of
Hatcher Graduate Library's most valuable doc-
uments. The exhibit has been displayed annu-
ally for the past 20 years. This year, the exhibit
is extended to the end of March, due to the visit

by the Royal Shakespeare Company.
"The Royal Shakespeare Company in Eng-
land has commissioned some new plays thatcel-
ebrate the 400th anniversary of the King James
Bible next year," Daub said.
"They are actually coming to campus in
March ... and that's why we're keeping the
exhibit open longer so it will be open when
they are here and people can come see the King
James after hearing about it."

Rogue Wave gets poppy on 'Permalight'

By ARIELLE SPECINER
For the Daily
What's the recipe for a typical
indie-rock album? Start with a sim-
plistic drumbeat,
throw in some ***
tambourines and
add a teaspoon of Rogue Wave
clap tracks mixed
in with a soft- Permalight
sounding male Brushfire
singer. Then, for
some flavor, add a dash of dance
beats and a large helping of overly
poetic (yet still charming) lyrics.
Put it all together and the resulting
concoction is Rogue Wave's fourth
album, Permalight.
The indie rock band from Cali-
fornia takes a different, well-played
approach on its first record after a
three-year hiatus. On past albums
Rogue Wave threw in a few dance
tracks and pop-synth beats, yet
retained traces of their folksy
charm. Permalight trades the usual
hypnotizing guitar riffs for some
club-thumping bass and poppy lyr-
ics.
The album opens with "Soli-
tary Gun," an acoustic standout in
tribute to late Rogue Wave bassist
Evan Farrell. Singer Zach Rogue
reminisces: "We've been suffering
the six days since he's died / I saw a
picture of his mother as she cried."
Despite such devastation, the band
is able to produce an upbeat song

and surround it with numerous
other cheery tracks.
The band is also clearly taking
more risks: "Good Morning (The
Future)," "Stars and Stripes" and
the title track each infuse electroni-
ca to a much greater extent than the
band has dared before. While much
of the album lacks true original-
ity, "Permalight" contains the most
unique sounds Rogue Wave has ever
put out. Starting with tribal grunts
as a glittery dance beat flows into
the background, the chorus imme-
diately grips the listener with sim-
ple but memorable lyrics like: "Turn
the light / On tonight / Permalight /
Say good night."
Less riffing, more
club-thumping.
On the other side of the spectrum
is acoustic ballad "I'll Never Leave
You." Rogue muses over his brand-
new baby girl in the track's camp-
fire-like serenade as he sings: "The
only thing I have is time / to bring
back this blood line of mine / Well,
I'll never leave you." The summery,
feel-good song is short, sweet and
to the point, with clapping percus-
sions on the chorus and happy gui-
tar chords dottingthe mix.
But after all is said and done,

Rogue Wave seems a bit confused
on Permalight. It's as if the band
members don't know which sound
they likethe most: hip, programmed
mechanizations or organic folk.
Permalight is a grab bag of solid
acoustic songs, fun dance numbers
and indie regulars, but as a whole
it's a bit lackluster.
Nevertheless, Permalight is a
delightful listen. The track "We

Will Make A Song Destroy" per-
fectly describes the album as "digi-
tal campfire." As front man Rogue
retains his folksy lyrical genius, he
pops up the record with perky per-
cussion and digital doodling. And
while Rogue Wave surely won't
cause a tsunami with Permalight,
it's certain to make a sizeable
splash for newcomers and long-
time fans alike.

A scrt made for

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Editor
INDIANAPOLIS - (Cut to: Con-
seco Field House, home of the 2010
Big Ten Tournament)
The Michigan men's basket-
bail
team
has just won
its first-round
matchup
against Iowa.
It moves on
to the second
round of the
tournament JOE
and will play STAPLETON
at noon tomor-
row against
Ohio State.
(Cut to: the stands of Conseco,
where two Michigan fans have just
finished singing the Victors after the
game. They sit down next to each
other)
Michigan fan 1: Well, they almost
gave that one away.
Michigan fan 2: Oh, come on.
They couldn't hit anything, but this
time they found a wayto win.
Fan 1: They were up by 16! How
do you let Iowa get to within five
with two minutes left?
Fan 2: Iowa did a good job fight-
ing back. That Cully Payne kid kept
them in the game. What'd he have,
like, 20 points?
Fan1: Twenty-five Apparently
guarding him was optional. Anyway,
it was the same old story as the rest
of the season. They still can't shoot
and they're still inconsistentoffen-
sively. I mean, they were under 30
percent from three, right?
Fan 2: Twenty-four percent.
Fan 1: (rolling his eyes) Good lord.
Fan 2: Yeah, except it's not the
same old story because this time
theywon. Look, you're thinkingtoo
much about the season that was.
They weren't continuing to shoot
poorly, they just had a bad shooting
night. Trust me it's healthier to do-
what the team's doing: just forget
about this season and focus on the
next game. Remember? It's a "new
season."

Fan 1: Did Coach Beilein give you
that line? Whatever, it's not like your
"new" (makes quotations in the air)
season is going beyond Ohio State
tomorrow.
Fan 2: What?! Firstof all, air
quotes are really lame. Secondly,
they obviously match up great
with Ohio State! Theybeat them at
home and played them real tough in
Columbus. Hell, they were ahead at
halftime!
Fan 1: Yeah, theybeat them at
home without Evan Turner, the Big
Ten Player of the Year, and they had
no business being ahead at halftime
in Columbus. I want them to win as
much as you do, but I just don't see it
happening. Yeah, Michigan won, but
Iowa sucks. They won'tbe playing
Iowa tomorrow.
Fan 2: Or the third-best, depend-
ing on how you look at it. Whatever.
I think they're gonna win.
Fan 1: Well, I think they're gonna
lose.
(Fade to black)
Michigan fans, like most fan
bases, are split between optimists
and pessimists. This season has
undoubtedly dealt a serious blow to
the number of optimists in Michi-
gan's camp,but they're out there.
The thing to remember, no mat-
ter what camp you fall into, is that
today's game against Ohio State
may be the last game of the Manny
Harris-DeShawn Sims era. Sure,
they could win, but if this season
is any indication, they will not. (I
guess I'mbetraying what camp I fall
into. Oh, well)
Barringablowout like the Wol-
verines suffered last weekend at
Michigan State, my advice to Michi-
gan fans is this: just try to enjoy
watchingthese two play.I'mriot
taking anything away from Anthony
Wright or Zack Gibson, but these are
the two players who have defined
this program for the past three
years. And today mightbe the last
time they take the court together in
Michigan uniforms.

ly - things we just didn't do at
Michigan State, and it turned out
terrible."
Beyond just balanced scoring
and offensive involvement, there
were other major differences
between yesterday's game and
the Wolverines' last loss. One
area they showed vast improve-
ment in was turnovers - they
forced 14 Hawkeye turnovers,
compared to turning the ball
over just eight times. Another
was Harris's involvement on both
sides of the ball. After a dreadful
scoring and rebounding perfor-

mance at Michigan State, he put
up 22 points and nine boards yes-
terday.
Michigan's win over Iowa was
its third of the season, and it
catapults the Wolverines into a
second-round matchup with No.
1 seed Ohio State on Friday at
noon.
"It might be a little bit of how
we match up with Iowa, but
we've had that contribution from,
a little bit of everybody against
them all three games this year,"
Douglass said. "We've got to keep
it going into Ohio State."

series that starts TV: Comcast
tonight.
And with
the Wolverines' 1-3 season record
against the Spartans, Michigan
coach Red Berenson will be the first
to tellyou how this series is not short
on plot twists.
"There's a lot of stories going into
this weekend," Berenson said with a
laugh.

And as much as the Wolverines
may miss their top defenseman
in senior captain Chris Summers,
Berenson remains confident that the
team's defensive corps is more than
capable of contending with the Spar-
tans' high-octane offense.
"When you lose a player, senior,
leader, captain, it speaks for itself,"
Berenson said. "But that's the way it
is. We can't sit here and feel sorry for
ourselves."
After Michigan handily defeated
the No. 10 seed Lake Superior State
last weekend, the Wolverines are
heading into the weekend with argu-
ably their most momentum of the
season.
Over and over, the players and
coaches have assured that the team
is playing its best hockey of the sea-
son right now.
The Wolverines accounted for 11
goals last weekend against the Lak-
ers, tying a season series high. But
more important than the proficiency'
on offense was the defense's perfor-
mance, allowing just two goals on
the weekend in one of its most com-
plete series of the year.

Considering the Spartans boast
three of the league's most talented
scoring forwards in Corey Tropp,
Andrew Rowe and Derek Grant,
playing smart, mistake-free defense
is what Berenson says will be Michi-
gan's key to success, especially with-
out an experience blue liner like
Summers suitingup.
"If we let the defense get out-
numbered time and time again, then
it won't matter who's on defense,"
Berenson said. "You saw what
happened the last time we played
Michigan State (at Munn Ice Arena).
Outnumbered rush, outnumbered
rush and a turnover. That's three
goals."
Senior defenseman Steve Kamp-
fer, who will be the de facto leader of
the defense with Summers out, says
that situations like what happened
last time against the Spartans have
plagued the Wolverines' perfor-
mances on the blue line all season.
"That's been our Achilles heel,"
Kampfer said. "We've had some
breakdowns this year in our defen-
sive zone and teams have capitalized
on us, and when you have a team like

Michigan State who can put pucks in
the back of the net, you have to make
sure you're playing as tight as pos-
sible defensively."
If there's a bright side for the Wol-
verines, it's that Michigan State is
limping into the CCHA Tournament,
having finished the season with a
record of 4-4-2.
But on the flip side, the Spartans'
disappointing finish has put them
squarely on the NCAA Tournament
bubble, which Berenson says will
provide Michigan State coach Rick
Comley with enough motivation to
light a fire under his struggling Spar-
tans.
Regardless, with playoff hockey
in full swing, Berenson insists that
nothing is guaranteed for either side,
especially in a matchup of two rival-
ry teams.
"You don't have any script for how
a playoff series might go," Beren-
son said. "We want to win the game
Friday, not give the home team any
confidence. But I've seen it work the
other way whereteams have lost and
bounce back. They're going to have
something to say about that too."

Bausher successfully fills nine-hole for Blue

tomorrow's Conseco
game between Fieldhouse
the Michigan TV: ESPN
basketball team
and Ohio State
isn't ordinary.
But despite the standings, the
Wolverines have fared reasonably
well against their rival this season.
While the Buckeyes are the No.
1 seed in the Big Ten and the fifth-
ranked team in the country, the
reality is, Michigan has bested Ohio
State in three of the four halves
they've played this year.
While BigTen Player of the Year
Evan Turner was out with a back
injury in the Wolverines' 73-64 win
over Ohio State on Jan. 3, Michigan
did play the Buckeyes tough later in
the year, losing 66-55 at Value City
Arena.
"I mean, we beat them for a full
game, and I think we beat them for
a half then the next game," sopho-
more Zack Novak said. "We're
confident going in. They're a really
good team. They've got a lot of tal-
ented guys. But we're going to be
ready to play, and just go out there
and have fun, see what happens."
After quickly falling behind in
that second game, the Wolver-
ines (7-11 Big Ten, 15-16 overall)
stormed back behind a first-half
team effort. While senior forward
DeShawn Sims boosted a 14-4 run,
it was threes by Novak and fellow
sophomore Stu Douglass thatreally
sparked the Wolverines, pulling
Michigan to a one-point halftime

lead.
Really, the only one not involved
was junior guard Manny Harris,
who scored just10points that game.
But Michigan kept it close by
having five players score in double
figures.
While the Buckeyes found a way
to shut down the Wolverines in the
second half, Harris's lack of pro-
duction was the key.
And once again, the matchup
will be between Michigan's star
offensive player and Ohio State
guard William Buford, who was
able to shut Harris down.
What should really scare the
Wolverines about the Buckeyes is
the improvements they made with
Turner not in the lineup. With him
out, they found secondary scorers
in Jon Diebler, Buford and David
Lighty who all average more than
12 points per game. Additionally,
the Buckeyes boast the Big Ten's
second-best scoring defense, allow-
ing justh60.4 points per game.
"The second time we played
them, they'd all gotten better with-
out (Turner)," Michigan coach
John Beilein said. "And then adding
him, it's just an X' factor to really
make them one of the league co-
champions or tri-champions and
a great chance to win the National
Championship."
To beat the Buckeyes (14-4 Big
Ten, 24-7 overall) , Michigan will
need Harris to be at his best against
arguably the toughest defensive
matchup he will face all year in
Buford. While it's a given that the
Wolverines don't stand much of a
chance without a third or fourth
scorer - like they haven't all sea-
son - against Ohio State, it requires
something extra.
The Wolverines know their
season will end with a loss tomor-
row against the Buckeyes, and the
message the last few days has been
to put it all on the line. With Ohio
Statelookingfor apossibleoneseed
in the NCAA Tournament, both
teams have something to play for.
"We just have to go and it's all
or nothing, and try to win it," Sims
said.

DeShields led off. In the team's four losses this

season, Bausher has mustered just
one hit in 11 opportunities. But
she's hitting an impressive .333
over Michigan's 14 victories. And
the team has won by a margin of
at least seven runs in each of her
multi-hit efforts.
Bausher's production may seem
unprecedented - she finished with
a career-best .244 batting average
in her junior season - but she's not
intimidated by the goal of main-
taining her average that's currently
40 points higher than last year's
finish.
"This season is a little different
than the rest because I am a senior
now." Bausher said. "I've figured
out what works and what doesn't
work, and I know what I need to do
to continue to be successful."
A major ingredient to maintain-
ing her success is patience. The
ability to wait for the right pitch

and not being overly aggressive at
the plate has been a three-year-
long progression. And it's one she's
still working on.
Through 18 games, Bausher has
still drawn just one walk. Although
her teammates want to believe she
can sustain her production without
taking more free bases, she knows
that's not the case.
"It's especially important for
me to not swing at too many balls."
Bausher said. "I have to let the
pitcher throw to me and avoid let-
ting her get two quick strikes."
In Hutchins's opinion, it
makes more sense to bat Aman-
da Chidester, Nikki Nemitz, and
Stephanie Kirkpatrick - who all
have lower batting averages than
Bausher - sixth, seventh and
eighth. And that's the look she's
gone with through the first quarter
of the season.
