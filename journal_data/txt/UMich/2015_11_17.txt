Vanessa Carlton was a fading 

memory in the minds of ’90s kids 
everywhere, her name merely 
standing as an indication of the 
seminal classic, “A Thousand 
Miles.” From 2002 to 2005, 
Carlton’s sugary piano ballads 
filled the radio airwaves. These 
Billboard-topping 
hits, 
like 

“A Thousand Miles,” “White 
Houses,” and “Ordinary Day,” 
were a heavy load to bear for 
one so young. The fast fame 
swallowed her name and image 
with what she was most known 
for. In the media vacuum that 
this 
early 
success 
created, 

Vanessa should have lost control 
of her image. By now, she should 
have fallen off into some island of 
once-famous musicians.

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily, 
Carlton 

recounted these early successes in 
a positive light: “It’s not all being 
measured up against some pop 
culture moment I had with a song 
I wrote when I was 16. Everyone 
has allowed me to grow.”

But with natural talent, hard 

work and a heavy concentration 
on 
individualistic 
musical 

stylings, Carlton disproved the 
stigma of the one-hit wonder 
pop star. Time away from the 
limelight paired with hours 
in international studios with 
renowned producers have helped 
her regain control on the reigns 
of her popularity. 

Her 2011 album, Rabbits on 

the Run, was the beginning 
of 
these 
decisive 
changes. 

Rabbits on the Run, if nothing 
else, communicated with her 
audience and former fans that 
artistic changes were imminent. 
And in her 2015 effort, Liberman, 
Carlton 
swallows 
whatever 

former images the media has 
cast. Her reformed artistry is 
minimalist, elegant and a quieter 
kind. With Liberman, she’s not 
some pop star with three Top 
40 hits that may or may not have 
dated John Mayer. Carlton has 
regained control over what she 
always was: a fantastic pianist 
with an ethereal voice who 
possesses an lyrical penchant for 
the lovelorn.

Named 
after 
Carlton’s 

grandfather, 
one 
of 
whose 

paintings of nudes hangs in the 
eyeline from the piano, Liberman 
was 
creatively 
nurtured

inducted to the Ann Arbor City Council on Monday.

Council approves 
next police chief, 
sends off outgoing 
city administrator

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Monday’s Ann Arbor City 

Council meeting featured two 
new faces — newly elected 
members 
Chip 
Smith 
(D–

Ward 5) and LSA senior Zach 
Ackerman (D–Ward 3). The 
council also welcomed back 
Jane Lumm (I–Ward 2), Sabra 
Briere (D–Ward 1) and Jack 
Eaton (D–Ward 4), who all 
returned to council for another 
term.

The 
council 
appointed 

James 
White, 
an 
assistant 

police chief with the Detroit 
Police Department, as Ann 
Arbor police chief, discussed 
the allocation of funds in 
preparation for winter weather 
and discussed the rezoning of 
the Nixon Farm properties.

The council unanimously 

approved City Administrator 
Steve Powers’ recommendation 
to appoint White to the role. 
White will start the position on 
Jan. 11, 2016.

“I’m happy to be able to 

support 
this 
appointment,” 

Lumm said. “The national 
search resulted in three very 
strong 
qualifying 
finalist 

candidates, 
and 
I 
believe 

Mr. White is an exceptional 
candidate. He will serve Ann 
Arbor very well.”

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) said 
she felt Ann Arbor residents 
responded 
well 
to 
White 

during the interview process.

Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 

Christopher 
Taylor 
also 

voiced support for White’s 
appointment.

“The three candidates were 

each excellent and would have 
served as chief ably and well,” 
Taylor said. “I look forward 
to working with Mr. White as 
police chief; he will have an 
important task.”

White was one of three 

finalists in running for Ann 
Arbor police chief, alongside 
Interim Police Chief Jim Baird 
and Rob Severance, a deputy 
city manager in Texas. John 
Seto, former AAPD police chief, 
accepted a role as director 
of the University’s Housing 

Security and Safety Services 
and announced his retirement 
from AAPD in May after 25 
years with the department. 

While 
council 
welcomed 

White to the city, they also said 
goodbye to City Administrator 
Steve Powers, who announced 
plans to accept a new job as 
city manager in Salem, Ore. 
in August. Tom Crawford, 
Ann Arbor’s chief financial 
officer, will serve as interim 
city administrator while the 
administration 
committee 

searches for a replacement.

Powers thanked the council 

for giving him the opportunity 
to serve the city of Ann Arbor.

“Thank you for taking a 

chance on a small county, 
community guy, and letting 
me work with you,” Powers 

ACADEMICS

Faculty body calls on 
regents to consider 
investments in oil 

and gasoline

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

Divest 
and 
Invest, 
the 

student-led campaign calling 
on the University to divest from 
oil and coal, scored a small step 
forward at Monday’s Senate 
Assembly meeting.

The 
Senate 
Assembly 

voted to support a resolution 
advocating the formation of 
a committee to review the 
University’s investments in oil 
and coal. During the meeting, 
the assembly also heard an 
annual report on the academic 
performance of the University’s 
student athletes.

The 
assembly 
discussed 

fossil 
fuel 
divestment 
last 

spring, but lost quorum before 
the 
motion 
to 
vote. 
Even 

with support of SACUA, the 
University’s Board of Regents 
must endorse the committee 
before it can form.

Divest and Invest president 

Nicholas Jansen, an LSA senior, 
noted divestment is just one 
approach to addressing climate 
change.

“We realize climate change 

is 
a 
huge 
problem; 
we’re 

not saying that this is the 

solution that is going to save 
everything,” 
Jansen 
said. 

“Being students, being at a 
University with political power 
and an image that people look 
up to, this is where we can take 
a stance and contribute to the 
problem. It’s a big problem, it’s 
going to take a lot of solutions.”

The 
University’s 
Divest 

and Invest campaign, formed 
in 2013, has spent the past 
two years encouraging the 
University’s administration to 
divest from fossil fuels, though 
the 
objective 
was 
recently 

amended to include only coal 
and oil, not natural gas.

Comprised 
of 
faculty, 

students, staff and alumni, the 
organization has urged the 
regents to form a committee 
that 
would 
review 
the 

University’s 
$1.04 
billion 

invested in fossil fuels.

Jansen 
has 
previously 

expressed frustration with the 
regents’ refusal to develop an 
ad hoc committee to investigate 
the University’s investments in 
fossil fuels.

“We have overwhelmingly 

demonstrated time and time 
again that we meet the three 
prong requirement needed for 
the Regents to form an ad hoc 
committee to look at divesting 
(from coal and oil) with the most 
recent being a nearly unanimous 
vote 
by 
CSG 
to 
support 

our resolution that ask the 
Regents to form the mentioned

Students consider 
class size, need for 
changes across the 
schools, colleges

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

During 
an 
open 
forum 

Monday 
afternoon, 
around 

20 
students 
expressed 

dissatisfaction with the LSA 
Race and Ethnicity requirement 

amid an ongoing review by the 
LSA Office of the Dean.

The 
current 
requirement 

mandates that LSA students 
take a course focusing on 
racial and ethnic inequality, as 
defined by LSA administrators, 
in order to graduate.

A leading concern at the forum 

was that many of the classes 
that satisfy this requirement 
are too large and therefore 
don’t 
meaningfully 
engage 

students 
in 
discussion. 
The 

three largest courses that fulfill 
this requirement are Cultural 

Anthropology 
101, 
Women’s 

Studies 220 and Public Health 
200, which enrolled 693, 366 
and 351 students in the fall 2014 
semester, respectively.

“When I took my Race and 

Ethnicity requirement it was in 
a class of over 300 people, and 
it was one of my favorite classes 
I’ve taken at the University,” said 
Public Policy junior Alexandra 
George, CSG communications 
director. 
“But 
because 
the 

class was so large people felt 
uncomfortable speaking up and

Researchers discover pathway 
that decreases fat absorption

LSA SG candidates speak 
on diversity, mental health

Removal of liver 
protein prevents 

cholesterol production

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

University 
research 
has 

recently found that a pathway 
in the liver controlled by the 
protein BAF60a can help the 
body absorb more cholesterol. 
Though at the very least this has 
unhealthy 
results, 
ultimately 

this problem could lead to medi-
cal issues such as hyperlipidemia 
and atherosclerosis.

Conducted 
by 
research-

ers from the University’s Life 
Sciences Institute, the study 
focused on the negative effects 
that a high-fat, high-cholesterol 
diet can have on the body.

Jiandie Lin, senior author of 

the study, said, “Atherosclerosis 
is a big issue, and high-choles-
terol levels are a major risk fac-

tor for atherosclerosis. The blood 
vessels get damaged and choles-
terol deposits in those sites that 
form . . . those clog up the artery. 
It could potentially go to the 
brain, go to the heart and cause 
stroke and heart attack.”

Lin, who is also the associate 

professor of cell and develop-
mental biology at the University’s 
Medical school, said he and his 
colleagues tried to understand 
how blood cholesterol concen-
trations are regulated in normal 
physiological 
conditions 
and 

potentially in disease conditions.

The researchers started by 

looking at a particular pathway 
of proteins called BAF60 pro-
teins, Lin said. BAF60 proteins 
are present in fat tissue, skeletal 
muscles, and in the liver. The 
proteins regulate different bio-
logical processes in each of these 
cells.

“What we found is that, if you 

feed mice [a Westernized] diet, 
the mice will become obese, they 
will develop hyperlipidemia – so 

basically, high blood-cholesterol 
levels,” Lin said.

Lin said they also found that 

the protein BAF60a levels were 
elevated in the liver. Therefore, 
Lin and his colleagues we were 
curious 
whether 
the 
higher 

amount of this protein could con-
tribute to hyperlipidemia.

“Because we know that this 

Western diet increased blood 
lipids, and we know that this 
Western diet also increased the 
level of this protein in the liver,” 
Lin said, “the question was really 
whether this increase in protein 
level somehow contribute to 
hyperlipidemia.”

According to Lin, mice who 

had the protein BAF60a deleted 
from their genetics do not devel-
op high blood lipids as do the 
normal mice, so they are partial-
ly protected from diet-induced 
hyperlipidemia. In normal mice 
when this protein is regulated 
in a way that it is supposed to 
be regulated, meaning without 
genetic alteration, the mice will 
develop high blood lipid levels.

After discovering these find-

ings, the question remained as to 
why this protein, when deleted 
from the liver, could actually 
protect the mice from bad lip-
ids. Ultimately, Lin said they 
were looking at genetic makeup 
to identify what subset of genes 
would be affected by the dele-
tion of the BAF60a protein in the 
liver.

“One of the things that stood 

out was the metabolic pathway 
that makes bile acid,” Lin said. 
“When we deleted this gene in 
the liver, we found that many, 
many genes that contribute to 
bile acid synthesis modification 
and secretion were significantly 
reduced. Somehow, this gene is 
important for really maintaining 
bile acid synthesis modification 
and release from the liver.”

According to Lin, bile is made 

in the liver and then gets released 
into small intestines for absorp-
tion of lipids and cholesterol.

LSA sophomore Nicholas Fadanelli, a student government candidate, campaigns at the LSA Student Government 
Candidate Forum in the League on Monday.

Ten candidates will 

run for election 
this Wednesday 

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Ten candidates for LSA Stu-

dent 
Government 
presented 

their ideas Monday night for 
increasing diversity of the stu-
dent body and and expanding 
mental health awareness in stu-
dent government and on campus. 
Elections will be held Wednes-
day.

LSA 
Student 
Government 

consists of 19 representatives 
elected by students in LSA. This 
year, nine positions are filled 
during the November elections, 
while the other 10 seats are up for 
election during the main student 
government elections in March.

LSA SG president Jason Colel-

la, LSA senior, said he enjoyed 
hearing ideas from the candi-
dates and he looks forward to 
implementing them.

“I think we have a great slate 

of candidates and I think no mat-
ter who wins or loses we’ll have a 
great upcoming semester at LSA 
Student Government,” Colella 
said

Apart from the candidates, 

less than 15 people attended. 
Colella said this turnout was not 
surprising.

“We always are hoping for a 

large turnout,” Colella said. “We 
try to get lots of students here. It’s 
important that students know 
who they’re voting for and I wish 
more LSA students would show 
up to these forums.”

Diversity

The 
candidates 
addressed 

concerns regarding diversity on 
campus, as well as the extent to 
which minority groups are rep-
resented in LSA SG.

LSA 
sophomore 
Nadine 

Jawad said inclusivity and diver-
sity on campus drive many of her 
goals for LSA SG. Jawad said she 
hopes her involvement in student 
government breaks stereotypes 
often attributed to Arab Ameri-
cans and Muslims in the media.

Jawad added that she is she is 

working on page through Uni-
versity Social Media to present 
community news about under-
represented groups on campus.

She said when she arrived on 

campus, she struggled to find a 
place where she felt safe, and that 
LSA SG should focus on improv-
ing sensitivity to minority stu-
dents on campus. She added that 
both Central Student Govern-
ment and LSA SG lack diversity 
in its membership. 

“I think we have to have peo-

ple on our student body who are 
representative of the campus as 
a whole,” Jawad said. “Whether 
it’s in CSG or in LSA SG, we’re 
kind of lacking in diversity.”

LSA 
freshman 
Chelsie 

Thompson proposed a diversity 
day where the campus would cel-
ebrate students of different back-
grounds.

“I want us to come together 

— not as a melting pot because 
that’s when we’d all get mixed 
together, and we’d all look basi-
cally the same again — but more 
as a mosaic so when we step back 

CHRISSTINA HAMILTON

Director of Penny Stamps lecture 

series talks program’s goals

Chrisstina 
Hamilton 
is 

the mind behind the Penny 
W. Stamps School of Art & 
Design’s Distinguished Lec-
ture Series, an event held 
every Thursday night of the 
academic year at the Michigan 
Theater. Hamilton is the for-
mer director of the Ann Arbor 
Film Festival, and now brings 
organizes a weekly event that 
draws more visitors every 
year.

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily, 
Hamilton 

discussed her personal career 
trajectory and how the Penny 
Stamps Speaker Series came 
to be what it is today. She was 

the first to occupy her posi-
tion, as the director of visitors’ 
programs, 10 years ago, when 
it was first created to develop 
the series into a more impact-
ful event.

Before Hamilton, the series 

was barely attracted present-
ers from outside Ann Arbor, 
drawing mostly on faculty to 
make up the series. Now, in the 
11th year under her direction, 
the series boasts big names 
like Anna Sui, David Yurman 
and the group Pussy Riot as 
among the series’ previous 
speakers.

“I love what I get to do now 

because I get to bring people 

together 
around 
important 

ideas and issues of today,” 
she said. “The most reward-
ing thing for me is when I see 
the light bulb go off in people’s 
heads all the time, when they 
make realizations.” 

Hamilton said she is “con-

stantly 
scanning 
for 
the 

cultural 
horizons,” 
when 

scheduling speakers and top-
ics for the series.

“It’s important to be con-

fronted with many different 
perspectives,” she said.

from it it’s just a whole better pic-
ture,” she said.

Thompson said misinforma-

tion is a pitfall for many students, 
and perpetuates stereotypes.

“I’m from Michigan, and when 

some people think of a Black girl 
from Michigan, they’re probably 
from Detroit,” Thompson said. 
“But that is wrong; I’m from Mel-
vindale, which is a small subur-
ban city outside of Detroit. The 
mentality of stereotypes have 
to be changed and not just with 
(Intergroup Relations) training.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Nicholas 

Fadanelli said minority groups 
feel they have difficulty getting 
their voices heard, and part of 
the responsibility to change those 
notions rests on the shoulders of 
student government.

“I want to reach out to other 

groups that we mainly don’t hear 
the voices of,” he said.

Mental health

Candidates also proposed mea-

sures that would improve mental 
health on campus.

LSA junior John Steffes, chair 

of the LSA SG health commit-
tee, said he hopes to work with 
campus gyms to make sure stu-
dents are aware of their fitness 
options. Steffes said knowing 
what exercise options are avail-
able is important for maintain-
ing students’ physical and mental 
health — especially for freshman 
and transfer students, who are 
less likely to know their options.

LSA junior Aditi Rao said put-

ting mental health resources 
on syllabi — a proposal that has 
already garnered support from 
CSG — could benefit students.

said. “I was impressed then by 
your intellect and stamina, and 
most importantly with your 
compassion and concern for the 
city. That has not changed with 
the 22 council members I’ve 
worked with.”

Several 
council 
members 

offered words of encouragement 
and farewell to Powers.

“You leave huge shoes to fill,” 

Councilmember Kirk Westphal 
(D–Ward 2) told Powers. “If 
there’s any downside to this, it’s 
the expectations. You’ve set the 
bar very high. I have to admire 
your 
professionalism, 
your 

intents, your listening abilities. 
It’s a really hard job and I 
admire that you’ve genuinely 

respected all the views around 
the 
table 
and 
among 
the 

residents.”

Later in the meeting, the 

council 
discussed 
winter 

emergency 
shelter 
and 

warming 
centers 
for 
the 

upcoming winter. They voted 
unanimously to allocate up to 
$89,040 for the initiative.

“The logic by doing it now 

is that by Dec. 1, everything 
should be in place,” Briere 
said. “It remains my hope and 
expectation that we can roll 
money for the winter shelter 
into the budget for next year.”

The 
Washtenaw 
Housing 

Alliance and the Office of 
Community 
and 
Economic 

Development formed a winter 
shelter work group to address 
winter shelter needs in the 
city. Led by Briere, the group 

reviewed 
shelter 
operations 

from the 2014-2015 winter. 
They found that while the 
city’s response worked well 
overall, several logistics and 
transportation 
challenges 

persisted.

Consequently, 
the 
group 

recommended 
the 
council 

provide 
funding 
for 
two 

overnight 
warming 
centers 

in Ann Arbor, providing a 
temporary shelter for homeless 
individuals at night in churches 
and community centers. The 
group 
also 
suggested 
the 

council 
allocate 
$11,000 
in 

funding for hotel and motel 
vouchers, as well as $18,000 
to 
fund 
transportation 
to 

the 
warming 
center. 
The 

recommendations 
anticipate 

another winter of extreme cold 
and aim to prioritize the needs 

of homeless individuals in Ann 
Arbor.

“This is pretty essential,” 

Eaton said. “It’s not a great deal 
of money, and yet it really goes 
a long way ensuring that no 
one dies on our watch. No one 
should die because of extreme 
weather.”

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski (D–Ward 5) said 
the council should consider 
future funding by looking at the 
large picture.

The council also voted to 

postpone the rezoning of the 
Nixon Farm properties until 
the body’s second meeting in 
December. The postponement 
delayed a vote on the site plans 
and zoning changes needed to 
greenlight 472 new residences 
on Nixon Road, near Dhu 
Varren Road.

The proposals both drew 

public 
commentary, 
mostly 

from neighbors to the area. 
Several community members 
voiced their opinion and said 
they felt that the city had not 
conducted 
enough 
research 

on 
traffic 
and 
floodwater 

ramifications.

Kailasapathy rallied for the 

residents who felt the Nixon 
Farm properties would damage 
the nearby areas.

“My 
advice 
is 
fix 
the 

problems, 
we 
don’t 
want 

another flooding lawsuit in our 
hands,” Kailasapathy said.

Eaton also said he did not 

feel 
comfortable 
approving 

the plans. He proposed the 
postponement and said the 
extra time would allow for the 
completion of additional studies 
on traffic and wetland impacts. 

committee,” he wrote in an e-mail 
last spring.

Last March, the University’s 

Central 
Student 
Government 

overwhelmingly 
voted 
to 

support the formation of such a 
committee.

However, 
in 
April, 
then-

CSG President Bobby Dishell 
vetoed a resolution that would 
have encouraged the University 
to 
become 
a 
signatory 
on 

the 
American 
College 
and 

University Presidents’ Climate 
Commitment, 
an 
undertaking 

by colleges and universities to 
address global climate change. 
Signatories pledge to eliminate 
net greenhouse gas emissions 
from certain campus operations.

In an e-mail statement issued at 

the time, Dishell cited investment 
concerns as one of his reasons for 
vetoing the resolution.

“Though the aims and efforts 

of the ACUPCC aspire to positive 
sustainable change — an issue 
that the University aligns with 
and takes very seriously — it also 

sets a specific target date for 
achieving net climate neutrality,” 
he wrote. “The University cannot, 
with sound investment in mind, 
commit to the ACUPCC because 
there is no way to concretely 
determine that these goals will be 
met by that target date.”

The University has divested 

for social reasons just twice in 
the past — first from South Africa 
during the apartheid, and again in 
2000 from tobacco companies.

In 2005, Timothy Slottow, 

the University’s former chief 
financial officer at the time, 
published a statement regarding 
the 
University’s 
divestment 

proceedings.

In 
the 
statement, 
Slottow 

said the regents would only 
appoint an ad hoc committee to 
investigate “the ethical and moral 
implications of our investments” 
if three conditions were met: the 
concern is shared consistently 
across campus, the behavior or 
action contradicts the University’s 
core mission and values and the 
“organization, industry or entity” 
identified is solely responsible for 
the issue.

In a viewpoint written for 

The Michigan Daily last month, 
Jansen said University President 
Mark Schlissel has said he does 
not believe the campaign has 
met the three pronged standard 
for the formation of an ad hoc 
committee.

Though fossil fuel divestment 

campaigns have taken root on 
hundreds of college campuses, 
few universities have divested 
from fossil fuels.

In 
May 
2014, 
Stanford 

University announced it would 
divest 
from 
coal 
companies, 

becoming 
the 
first 
major 

university to begin divesting from 
fossil fuels.

Athletics report

English Prof. Anne Curzan, the 

faculty athletics representative, 
and Business Prof. David Wooten, 
both members of the Academic 
Performance 
Committee, 

presented the committee’s annual 
report to the assembly.

The Academic Performance 

Committee is a subcommittee 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Board 
on 

Intercollegiate Athletics, which 
reports to the provost on matters 
pertaining 
to 
the 
academic 

welfare of student-athletes.

According to the report, the 

University’s athletic department 
is comprised of 25 sports teams 
and 797 student-athletes.

Last 
year, 
the 
University 

recognized 
eight 
Academic 

All-Americans. To receive this 
honor, a student-athlete must 
have a cumulative 3.3 GPA and 
start more than 50 percent 
of his or her games. During 
the 2013-2014 academic year, 
the University recognized six 
Academic All-Americans, and 
before that, the University had 
not recognized more than four 
since 2005.

During the 2014-2015 fall and 

winter semesters, 184 student-
athletes 
received 
University 

Honors. To qualify for this award, 
the student must have a 3.5 GPA 
for that semester and must be 
taking 14 credits, 12 of which 
must be graded.

An additional 260 student-

athletes 
were 
honored 
as 

Academic All-Big Ten, the most 
in recent history. Academic All-
Big Ten honorees must maintain 
a 3.0 GPA and must letter in their 
sports. 

Advisory 
Committee, 
which 

is comprised of 12 faculty 
members, four students and 
one liaison from the Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University 
Affairs. 
SRAC 

is 
currently 
charged 
with 

reviewing 
the 
initial 
batch 

of proposals, including those 
offered 
by 
Central 
Student 

Government.

Statistics 
Prof. 
Edward 

Rothman, who serves as SRAC 
chair 
during 
the 
current 

amendment 
cycle, 
said 
the 

committee aims to clarify the 
proposed 
amendments, 
but 

not question the merits of each 
change.

“We spent about an hour 

or 
so 
going 
through 
the 

proposed amendments student 
government brought forward,” 
he said.

Rothman said he had been on 

the committee for several years, 
and proposals from students 
are of particular interest to 
the committee. He said the 
committee heard a presentation 
in 
which 
Public 
Policy 

sophomore 
Jacob 
Pearlman, 

CSG general counsel, outlined 
amendments suggested by CSG.

CSG 
proposed 
seven 

revisions: 
establish 
formal 

venues to gather input on 
revisions, an honor pledge, 
implement 
formal 
education 

about the student statement 
during new student orientation 
and a consistent three-year 
amendment cycle.

CSG 
also 
proposed 
an 

amendment to ensure students 
aren’t disciplined for violating 
revisions 
to 
the 
statement 

enacted after the action in 
question occurred. They also 
proposed 
formalizing 
the 

University 
president’s 
need 

to select amendments before 
the end of the school year, and 
allowing CSG access to records 
related to the process.

Pearlman spearheaded the 

process of composing CSG’s 
proposals, and Rothman noted 
that having a single person 
author all the proposals was 
incredibly useful.

“When proposals are written 

by committees you’re trying 
to incorporate a myriad of of 
perspectives in the document,” 
Rothman 
said. 
“It’s 
much 

more difficult to get a cohesive 
message than what you might 
get from having a single person 
write the amendments.”

Pearlman 
said 
he 
was 

surprised by the lack of student 
knowledge about the statement, 
considering it pertains only to 
students.

“The statement is supposed 

to 
be 
a 
‘community-owned 

document’ 
that 
highlights 

the values of our institution,” 
Pearlman said. “Unfortunately, 
most 
students 
are 
entirely 

unaware of what the statement 

is, and how it can affect them.”

He also said the current 

CSG 
administration 
focused 

on increasing student voice 
and input in the University 
decision-making 
processes, 

which resulted in amendments 
pertaining 
to 
the 
revision 

process itself.

“The 
amendment 
process 

as 
it 
stands 
is 
potentially 

restrictive to student voice, and 
much of the true power is held 
by faculty and administrators,” 
Pearlman said. “Faculty are not 
subject to the rules outlined in 
the statement.”

Though the process begins 

with students’ participation, 
it does not always end with 
their input informing the final 
amendments. During the 2001 
amendment cycle, none of the 
proposed 
amendments 
put 

forth by student government 
— then called the Michigan 
Student Assembly — made it 
into the statement.

Erik 
Wessel, 
director 
of 

the Office of Student Conflict 
Resolution, said his office helps 
guide the statement revision 
process since they receive all 
the 
amendments 
proposed 

before they are sent for SRAC’s 
consideration.

“OSCR is really the keeper of 

the Statement of Student Rights 
and Responsibilities,” Wessel 
said. “Obviously we use it 
everyday in our general work.”

Wessel 
said 
OSCR 

emphasizes 
a 
restorative 

process 
for 
addressing 

statement 
violations. 
After 

a student is notified of the 
allegations against him or her, 
he or she attends an intake 
meeting where OSCR presents 
options 
for 
resolving 
the 

violation.

He said the collaborative 

relationship 
between 
CSG 

and OSCR during this year’s 
amendment process was more 
cohesive compared to recent 
years.

“I think that we’re seeing the 

fruits of that labor here,” Wessel 
said. “I’m not sure if we’ve seen 
this caliber in the relationship 
with CSG ever before.”

Rothman said he appreciated 

that many of the proposals 
focused on raising awareness 
about the statement.

“Students should be aware 

of having the implications of 
having the proposed changes 
in place,” he said. “Students 
are taking the responsibility 
to make modifications to put 
a process in there to assure 
that students coming to the 
University will at least know 
about these issues.”

He also said he respected 

the honor code proposal, and 
deemed it a proactive approach 
to dealing with issues like the 
January ski trip, during which 
fraternity members inflicted 
several 
hundred 
thousand 

dollars worth of damages.

“It’s as though we imagine 

the way to fight crime is by 

building more prisons, and 
that, of course, is nonsense,” 
Rothman said. “We’ve got to 
be proactive, and figure out 
why it is people are engaged in 
crime. And here with respect to 
students, by moving upstream 
and 
attempting 
to 
build 

awareness and engagement by 
the students in these changes, 
we hope to reduce the issues 
that come about as a result of 
bad behavior.”

Rothman said the manner 

in which students treat one 
another is essential to the 
University experience, and the 
statement is the best method of 
clarifying appropriate behavior 
before students enter murky 
situations.

“The notion of what that 

means needs to be made clear 
at a point where you’re not at 
that party and intoxicated and 
reacting to the circumstances 
in a way where your decision-
making skills may not be quite 
as strong,” Rothman said.

After 
SRAC’s 
review, 
E. 

Royster Harper, vice president 
for student life, will again 
review the proposals before 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel has the final say.

“Regardless of our advice, 

President Schlissel will look at 
the recommendations and it’s 
his prerogative to say yea or 
nay,” he said.

asking questions.”

Students 
also 
expressed 

concern that many of the courses 
that 
technically 
satisfy 
the 

requirement actually fail to meet 
the criteria used by the LSA 
administration to classify courses 
as Race and Ethnicity. One such 
course mentioned was Public 
Health 200, which, although 
containing 
a 
unit 
examining 

health care disparities by race, 
focuses on data and fails to 
have any discussion about the 
underlying causes of inequality, 
attendants said.

Evans 
Young, 
assistant 

dean 
for 
undergraduate 

education, 
who 
was 
present 

at 
the 
event, 
acknowledged 

student concerns and laid out 
some tentative solutions, such 
as 
adding 
questions 
to 
the 

course evaluations of courses 
satisfying the Race and Ethnicity 
requirement so that departments 
can have better feedback data, 
and providing more training to 
Graduate 
Student 
Instructors 

of such classes to better engage 
students.

Throughout 
the 
forum, 

participants 
reaffirmed 
the 

importance of the requirement, 
citing ongoing racial tensions at 
the University of Missouri and 
on other college campuses, as 
well as incidences of racism at the 
University. Engineering senior 
Erin Moore spoke at the forum, 
providing a personal example of 
this behavior.

“I was on a bus in North 

Campus and I was reading an 
article and watching videos about 
what’s happening on another 
college campus,” Moore said, 
referring to the protests occurring 
on the University of Missouri’s 
campus, “and someone tapped me 

on my shoulder and said, ‘We’re 
sharpening our knives in case 
you guys are planning on doing 
something — just so you’re aware.’ 
” 

A number of students also 

argued 
that 
the 
Race 
and 

Ethnicity 
requirement 
should 

be universally required across 
all 
other 
undergraduate 

schools, including the College 
of Engineering and Ross School 
of Business. Currently, only LSA 
students are required to satisfy 
this requirement.

“We are in a moment where we 

can change this requirement and 
apply it to the entire University,” 
said LSA senior Branden Shafer, 
a CSG representative. “You can 
take all the science courses you 
want, all the engineering courses 
you want and be brilliant, but 
you also need that broader 
knowledge of the people that you 
interact with and the world you 
live in.”

Body found in river

Police responded to a call 

Monday afternoon after a body

The name of the man found has

Police

Gov. Snyder refuses 
to allow in more 
Syrian refugees

Sunday, Michigan Gov. Rick 

Snyder joined 23 other states that 
have announced they will not 
accept Syrian refugees in their 
states.

The statement came in response 

to the Paris terrorist attack by 
ISIS, which killed 132 people and 
injured hundreds.

Governors have taken different 

approaches to the blocking of 
refugees. Some have completely 
banned refugees from entering, 
while others 
— like Snyder — have 

put a temporary ban on refugees 
entering.

Snyder 
has 
welcomed 

immigrants 
and 
refugees 
in 

the past. In September, Snyder 
said he was working with the 
federal government to increase 
the number of Middle Eastern 
refugees.

Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, 

Florida, 
Georgia, 
Idaho, 

Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, 
Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Mississippi, 
Nebraska, 
New 

Hampshire, 
North 
Carolina, 

Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin 
governors are among the other 
states who are banning the 
admittance of refugees from Syria.

Study abroad 
increases 15 percent

More and more students are 

packing their bags to experience 
college life abroad.

For the second consecutive 

year, the number of U.S. students 
studying abroad increased by 15 
percent, according to a Univer-
sity release Monday. In 2013-14, 
the University had 2,719 students 
earning credit abroad, compared 
with 2,365 in the 2012-13 school 
year.

This 
increase 
in 
students 

abroad raised the University in 
standings among higher education 
institutions with the most stu-
dents overseas. According to the 
Open Doors report by the Insti-
tute of International Education, 
the University rose from sixth to 
fifth place. This puts the Univer-
sity behind New York University, 
the University of Texas at Austin, 
Texas A&M University and the 
University of Southern California, 
in that order.

The Open Doors report is the 

most complete census of education 
abroad in the United States. How-
ever, the study does not include 
students who are not U.S. citizens. 
It also does not include students 
who go abroad for noncredit activ-
ities, like internships or volunteer 
opportunities. 

Michigan attorney 
general to lead 
national association

The 
Republican 
Attorneys 

General Association announced 
Monday that Michigan’s Attor-
ney General Bill Schuette will be 
appointed chair of the national 
association.

The association is composed of 

27 Republican attorneys general.

In a press release, Schuette said 

he is eager to take on the role.

“It is my honor to serve as chair 

during this critical time in which 
federal government overreach is 
hurting job creation and economic 
growth in our states and our coun-
try as a whole,” Schuette said. “I 
look forward to working with the 
other 26 Republican attorneys 
general in the fight to protect free 
enterprise, liberty and our consti-
tution.”

Actively listening to activists
M

onths before setting foot 
in Ann Arbor for the first 
time, before taking any 

class about femi-
nist 
literature 

or 
social 
jus-

tice, and before 
“intersectional-
ity” ever entered 
my vocabulary, 
I 
was 
sitting 

on 
the 
floor 

at 
a 
friend’s 

house 
receiv-

ing advice that 
seemed obvious 
at the time. My 
friend’s mother 
— describing how college campuses 
were centers of immense debate 
and discussion — told a group of us 
that while we were all attending 
these large institutions, one of the 
most important things we could do 
was to stay observant and engaged.

Coming from a rural, small town 

built upon conservative, old-fashioned 
values, some form of culture shock 
was inevitable for us all, whether 
we were traveling “downstate” or 
across the country. We were told that 
on our respective campuses we’d 
encounter discussions, causes and 
demonstrations of all kinds: ones some 
of us were just beginning to champion 
ourselves, new ones that would align 
with our beliefs, ones we’d strongly 
disagree with, ones that were entirely 
unheard of at the time and ones 
that may challenge everything we’d 
known for the past 18 or so years. 
Regardless of our thoughts on the 
issue, it was important for us to listen 
to everything being said and always 
consider alternative viewpoints. As 
my college career begins to close, 
I never would’ve imagined that 
within these centers of activism and 
demonstration, voicing concerns 
about relevant issues, such as 
racism, oppression and sexism, 
would be seen as the whining of an 
over-sensitive population. 

Looking at the news, it’s undeniable 

that college campuses have been in 
uproar and shrouded in dialogues 
of reform recently. The collective 
feeling among students, particularly 
minority and marginalized students, 
is one of frustration and protest. For 
months, students have denounced 
the inaction of their universities, 
vocalizing 
long-held 
frustrations. 

Events at the University of Missouri, 
Yale University, the University of 

Michigan and others have indicated 
unaddressed, 
underlying 
racial 

tensions on college campuses and 
signaled a dire need to foster better 
dialogues about the experiences of 
minority students.

However, by doing so, students are 

doing exactly what colleges often ask 
them to do as they learn: question and 
challenge the status quo.

From first meetings in lecture halls 

to senior year, colleges ask students 
to reconsider how they think about 
and view the world. We’re heavily 
encouraged by our professors to avoid 
just being passive observers. Instead, 
we’re expected to be active, informed, 
inquisitive and vocal in our studies 
and in our interactions with others.

With such rhetoric and prompting, 

it’s no surprise that universities and 
colleges in the past have served as 
the foundations of various social 
movements and are so conducive 
to fostering activism. Historically, 
they’ve been environments of debate, 
controversy and contention. Taking 
this into consideration, it’s frustrating 
to see current measures of social 
questioning and action labeled as the 
overreactions of a “coddled,” fragile 
generation 
of 
over-liberal, 
over-

sensitive individuals.

A hunger strike shouldn’t be seen as 

a response that’s “disproportionate to 
the offense.” A football team refusing 
to participate in games while issues of 
racism remain unaddressed shouldn’t 
be seen as a group of young men 
being disrespectful and taking their 
status as student athletes for granted. 
There should be no conflicting notion 
between encouraging students to 
speak their minds about important 
issues of race and equality and then 
labeling them as “coddled” or “too 
liberal” when they do so. Rather, the 
general population should be asking 
itself why such strong measures were 
necessary in the first place.

Those quick to label these activists 

as a part of a population too sensitive, 
too obsessed with being politically 
correct and too out of touch with the 
world need to stop operating under the 
presumption these students are blank 
slates without any prior experience, 
who 
were 
entirely 
protected 

beforehand and are just suddenly 
rejecting the complexity and conflicts 
of the world. While some students are 
undoubtedly more privileged than 
others, and this privilege certainly 
needs to be addressed, students, to 
varying degrees, have encountered 

their own experiences of sexism, 
racism, homophobia or classism earlier 
in their lives. These experiences 
can’t be discounted. As Roxane Gay 
aptly states in a piece for the New 
Republic, “College students do, 
however, understand the real world 
because they aren’t just students. 
They do not abandon their class 
background or sexuality or race or 
ethnicity when they matriculate, 
and these issues do not vanish when 
they register for courses.”

Taking these experiences into 

account, students are voicing these 
concerns because they’re aware of the 
injustice that needs to be remedied. A 
common critique of these groups is that 
these demonstrations are suppressing 
speech. Yet, those concerned about 
speech must also consider that 
students are demonstrating in order 
to draw attention to the suppression of 
their own voices.

In order for tangible change to 

occur, debate is absolutely necessary. 
But nothing will be achieved if one 
or both sides are dismissing one 
another. Respect must be shared 
on both sides. Labeling the outcry 
and demands of a population of 
students seeking change as “over-
reacting” is, in itself, diminishing 
and suppressing viewpoints that 
may not necessarily want to be heard 
by those who disagree.

Perhaps current attitudes about 

student activism are merely the result 
of time. Those critiquing college 
students now were part of generations 
that once held their own protests, 
caused their own uproar, became the 
focal point of media attention and were 
critiqued by preceding generations. 
Perhaps one could just chalk it up to a 
generation gap and a cyclical nature of 
youthful idealism and optimism.

One 
of 
my 
classes 
recently 

discussed how time can be a privilege 
to those in power, and we debated 
the common misleading argument 
that society — if left only to the 
overwhelming influence of time — 
will change on its own without our 
intervention. However, time also 
functions as a mirror to illustrate 
how much or little things may have 
changed, and recent actions taken 
by students demonstrate that these 
issues have been left unhealed by 
time — or have evolved entirely — 
and need our attention.

Speaking out for choice

EMILY ZONDER | VIEWPOINT

Last Thursday night, I had the 

pleasure of attending Students for 
Choice Abortion Speak Out. I sat in 
a room full of people — teenagers, 
students and adults alike. I listened 
to a dozen brave, powerful voices 
share their stories, some for the 
very first time. The two hours 
passed like seconds — each moment 
filled with immense emotion, each 
story told with a profound sense of 
individuality and ownership unlike 
any that I had ever witnessed before.

Needless to say, when I left that 

room, my head was rushing and 
my heart was pounding. I felt so 
many things on such an utterly deep 
and real level. I felt frazzled and 
confused, experiencing a range of 
emotions at a speed that I couldn’t 
quite comprehend.

Looking back, the most prominent 

feeling floating around in my brain 
that evening was an incredible 
sense of sonder, which is a word 
and concept that may be slightly 
unfamiliar to some. Essentially, 
sonder is an understanding that 
every person you encounter has 
their 
own 
individual 
life 
and 

story, 
complete 
with 
emotions 

and experiences that are as deep 
and complex as your own. It is an 
understanding that every human 
being on this planet has a timeline, 

a head, a heart, a sex drive, a voice 
inside their head, a personalized 
moral compass — a story.

Listening 
to 
the 
voices 
on 

Thursday — the beautiful, unique 
and complex voices — I could feel this 
sense wash over me. Every story gave 
me a small glimpse of the depth that 
was tucked underneath the surface 
of each person, at the individuality 
that each of us has and the power 
that accompanies that. I was in awe. 
I was completely captivated by each 
soul that so bravely stepped up to 
the microphone and by each story 
that was shared.

But after a phone call with my 

dad, several conversations with 
my politically charged friends and 
hours in my room filled with pacing, 
journaling and frustration, this 
feeling slowly evolved. I thought 
about all that I had heard — every 
expression of gratitude regarding 
the choices that these people had, as 
well as every mention of the current, 
restrictive 
legislation 
and 
the 

politicians who are doing everything 
in their power to take this choice 
away. My comforting sense of sonder 
warped into something different 
entirely: outrage.

I left that room, as I sit here now, 

with an overwhelming sense of 
outrage. 

My outrage is not only over the 

fact that there are people — strangers 
— who are currently attempting to 
gain the power to make decisions 
about my body. It is over the fact 
that there are people — strangers — 
who want to make decisions about 
all bodies. It is over the fact that 
there are people — strangers — who 
believe that one decision, the same 
decision, can be the right decision 
for all women in every instance for 
each of their individual existences.

How can anyone justify that? 

How can anyone claim that they 
have the right to tell all women how 
to govern their bodies? And how 
can anyone argue that all bodies 
can and should be governed in the 
same way?

By taking away choice, you are 

viewing the right to abortion as 
merely a political issue, when in 
reality it is much more than that: It is 
a deeply personal one. When you take 
away choice, when you categorize all 
women under one umbrella and claim 
that you know what will be best for 
each of their unique bodies and lives, 
you are denying the existence of the 
individual experiences that every 
woman has, as well as the personal 
attention that every woman deserves.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

I

n the corner of a small bulletin board, the 
copy desk at The Michigan Daily has a 
“guide to dashes.” You may be thinking, 

“What could there possibly be to know about 
dashes?” or “Why would anyone need a guide 
for that?” My guess is that you’ve probably been 
using them incorrectly since you learned about 
them in the grammar unit of fourth-grade 
language arts.

The guide to dashes explains the three 

differing lengths of dashes and their uses. 
The shortest (and most common) dash is the 
hyphen. Hyphens are used for a variety of 
reasons, such as to combine two words into 
one idea as we do for compound adjectives. For 
example: “My post-graduation plans are still 
up in the air, unlike my tech-savvy friends who 
have already landed full-time jobs.” See? Two 
words, but one thought.

The second, slightly longer dash is the 

en-dash. Because the Daily really only uses 
these for political party affiliation, like Sen. 
Gary Peters (D–Mich.), I won’t elaborate. What 
I really want to talk about is the em dash — my 
favorite of all the dashes.

The Daily has a 65-page guidebook that 

dictates how we style the newspaper, and 
the entry on em dashes states that they’re 
often overused. But because em dashes can 
denote an abrupt change in a sentence — 
or a parenthetical aside — I feel that every 
time I add them — appropriately, of course 
— I internally debate whether or not the 
use is justified. Did that string of words feel 
parenthetical enough? What if that assertion 
wasn’t meant to read so abruptly? I weigh these 
considerations carefully. I have to — it’s my job. 
In my own writing I am partial to the em dash, 
because when I plunk it out on my keyboard, I 
acknowledge the inevitable abrupt change that 
is coming to my life after graduation.

It’s my senior year at the University. 

Someone once told me I had hit all the bases in 
terms of where I lived — freshman year, North 
Campus; sophomore year, a sorority house; 
junior year, the East Packard neighborhood 
on a lovely street called Greenwood; senior 
year, the Old Fourth Ward. I reflect upon how 
much I loved my dorm room — the sun filtered 
through the trees and onto my bed in the best 
way — and how much I struggled living in a 
sorority house. I lived on a street that always 

seemed to shimmer from broken glass bottles. 
I now live so near to the police and fire stations 
— and, frankly, the street that is the most direct 
route to the hospital — that emergency sirens 
punctuate my dreams. Each year existed in 
between two dashes — separated from the 
previous year — like a fresh start in a new home.

The 
transient 
nature 
of 
college 
is 

unparalleled. I may never again live on a glass-
littered street, or have to race someone to the 
landlord’s office in order to secure a lease. 
Each fall, I cart all of my belongings up flights 
of stairs and try to make the arrangement feel 
like home for a brief period of time. Then there 
will be move-out day, and it always seems — 
think two weeks of homelessness between 
leases — abrupt.

College — like the em dash — symbolizes four 

years of abrupt change and parenthetical asides. 
My classes begin and end so quickly that I never 
seem to learn everyone’s names. The clubs and 
extracurriculars I joined as a freshman either 
no longer exist, or I’ve quit being a part of 
them. The friends from past years fade away. 
The person I was as a freshman in Bursley is 
certainly not the same woman writing this 
column. If that wasn’t the case, I’d be worried.

Graduation day looms as the ultimate 

change — a formal ceremony to celebrate 
finishing a degree and getting the boot into 
the working world. I imagine by then I’ll feel 
stable and at peace with myself and the person 
I’ve become, but what if I never truly get there? 
I recognize that this four-year period of my 
life — one in which I’ve finally come to feel as 
if I’ve gotten the hang of it — is on the verge of 
ending. I have no qualms about changing U.S. 
to United States when it’s used as a noun, or 
placing a four-word title after a name, but I do 
worry about who I’ll be when all of the things 
that define me as a person at this University 
fall away.

Maybe the dash won’t be as meaningful 

when I’m not a student anymore and I’ve settled 
into a job. Maybe the abrupt changes I’ve come 
to expect will be few and far between. Maybe 
then, change won’t feel as sudden as it does 
each year as a college student. Maybe by then, 
I’ll start using more commas.

Copy That: The em dash

L

et me just enjoy the IASA show first and 
then I’ll worry about it.”

These are the actual words that 

left my mouth during the 
Indian American Student 
Association’s annual dance 
performance, Azaya, last 
Friday, in response to a friend 
telling me about the several 
tragedies that occurred that 
night. It very succinctly, 
yet 
colorfully, 
illustrates 

my relationship with world 
news while on campus here 
at the University.

Two years ago, when I 

was a senior in high school, 
I thought college would 
be “Campus” by Vampire Weekend. I pictured 
everyone as those cliché opinionated college 
students, crossing the Diag in autumn while 
wearing horn-rimmed glasses and heatedly 
discussing 
the 
Arab-Israeli 
conflict 
with 

classmates.

Instead, it’s been “Sweatpants” by Childish 

Gambino. Not only do I wear the same H&M 
joggers every day (not gonna lie, they’re 
dope and versatile), but I have also almost 
completely replaced any attention I could 
possibly pay to world events with other things. 
I used to call myself a global citizen not only 
due to my international experiences, but also 
due to my interest in and empathy for world 
issues. Now, instead of catching up on news 
first thing in the morning or before I go to bed, 
I rewatch Royal Family hip-hop dance videos. 
Every. Single. Day.

It’s not that I don’t love the student 

organizations I’m involved in. I’m just 
concerned about the fact that it becomes so 
easy to get distracted and isolated from the rest 
of the world here. The cliché metaphor made 
about the University, and college campuses in 
general, is that the students live in a bubble. 
While this comparison has value, I think it’s 
not so much that we’re all isolated from the 
world, but rather that it’s insanely easy to just 

not pay any attention to life outside of our 
campus. Obviously, so many college students 
are very politically involved and aware of 
world events, but it’s just SO EASY to live for 
months at a time with blinders on, blocking 
everything except classes and student orgs. 
I’m so privileged that I have the option of 
living like this.

The scariest part, at least for me, is that 

I have to ask myself how willful it is. Like 
with the IASA show, was my gut reaction a 
problematic one? Am I a horrible person for 
wanting to not yet know about the tragedies 
occurring so that I could wholeheartedly 
cheer on my friends on stage? Sure, I did my 
research and educated myself on the events 
afterwards, but that initial rejection to even 
face the outside world while enjoying myself 
in (bubble-shaped) Hill Auditorium has to 
warrant some self-reflection.

I spent my free time during the summer 

between high school and college reading 
memoirs and listening to National Public Radio. 
This completely stopped when I started at the 
University, without me even realizing it. After my 
freshman year, I returned to this leisure routine 
again in the summer, promising myself that in my 
second year I wouldn’t make the same mistake 
again. But I did.

As much as I love reading memoirs and 

listening to NPR, for some reason I just can’t 
bring myself to do it here, and I think that’s 
somewhat a reflection of just how much of 
a bubble the University can be. Granted, it 
was much easier to listen to NPR when I 
was commuting to and from Detroit for my 
summer internship, but there are other ways 
to still conveniently engage with the news 
while on campus.

I just hope that I manage to find those ways 

of reconnecting with the world again soon. 
But first, I have to work on this EECS project. 
Oh, and I have to choreograph for Izzat, too. 
Oh man.

ALBUM REVIEW
Justin Bieber’s new 
aggressive apologies

‘Purpose’ is a good 
career strategy with 

a modern sound

By RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writer

On 
Friday, 
Justin 
Bieber 

released his fourth studio album, 
Purpose, to let us all know he’s 
really, 
really 

sorry for every-
thing 
he 
has 

done in the last 
couple of years: 
for the time he 
was detained on 
charges of driv-
ing under the 
influence 
and 

resisting arrest, for the whole 
vandalizing-his-neighbor’s-
house-with-eggs-and-causing-
$20,000-in-damage thing, for 
assaulting a limo driver in Toron-
to, for spitting on fans from a 
balcony and for, of course, aban-
doning his pet monkey in Munich 
(possibly his worst transgression 
to date).

But like he explains on the hit 

single “Sorry,” “you know that I 
try but I don’t do too well with 
apologies.” That’s evident on 
Purpose; it’s his attempted ret-
ribution narrative, rather than a 
well-curated collection of songs. 
Bieber asks his fans — and his 
ex-girlfriend and singer Selena 
Gomez — to forgive him, maybe 
with a little more aggression that 
we’d like.

The opening track, “Mark My 

Words,” begins Bieber’s apol-
ogy and promise to be better. 
“I’ll Show You” has the singer 
reminding us, “Don’t forget that 
I’m human / Don’t forget that I’m 
real.” On “No Pressure,” he takes 
responsibility for his actions, “I 
made a few mistakes / I did it 
to myself / I’m the only one to 
blame.” The unironically titled 
“Life Is Worth Living” addresses 
the scrutiny he’s faced, “They try 
to crucify me / I ain’t perfect, 
won’t deny / My reputation’s on 
the line / So I’m working on a 

better me.”

And his apology culminates on 

the final track, the album’s title 
track, “Purpose,” which ends 
with a minute-long monologue 
about his coming of age expe-
riences, “You can’t be hard on 
yourself for these were the cards 
that you were given, so you have 
to understand that these, like … 
that’s not who you are.”

Still, when Bieber’s on, he’s 

on. By modern-production stan-
dards, Purpose contains some 
outstanding tracks. With the 
help of household house music 
producer 
Skrillex, 
we 
for-

get about Bieber’s overeager 
redemptive narrative and just 
enjoy 
ourselves. 
Pre-released 

singles “What Do You Mean?” 
and “Sorry,” which follow each 
other successively, mark some 
of the most satisfying moments 
on the album. Despite the unin-
spired lyrics on “Where Are U 
Now” (“Where are you now that 
I need you? / Where are you now 
that I need you? / Where are you 
now that I need you?”) and “I’ll 

Show You” (“My life is a movie 
and everyone’s watching”), the 
synthesized dance beats boast 
Skrillex’s dominant presence on 
the album. “Mark My Words” 
offers a Bieber exposed, and “No 
Pressure” calls to mind Confes-
sions-era Usher, the more sultry 
sound highlighting Bieber’s raw 
vocal talent. 

But the cacophony of dif-

ferent genres feels a bit jar-
ring. The grotesquely insincere 
“Children” asks, “What about 
the children? / Look at all the 
children we can change / What 
about the vision?” before enter-
ing into a Skrillex-produced beat 
drop. On ballad “Life is Worth 
Living,” Bieber compares his 
love life to an avalanche — “Rela-
tionship on a ski slope” — almost 
immediately after tracks with 
Travi$ Scott and Big Sean fea-
tures; it feels unnatural. In the 
Ed Sheeran-written “Love Your-
self,” Bieber regresses back to 
his 2009 “Baby” sound, displac-
ing the album’s “look at me, I’m 
growing as a person!!” narrative.

Bieber may not be great with 

apologies, but this project proves 
it’s never too late to say sorry. 
And as far as career strategies 
go, this album is a damn good 
one. The singer may have slightly 
compromised his sound and his 
vocal abilities to fit the current 
dance club-driven music scene, 
but Purpose shows Bieber’s got 
just that again.

STAND-UP SPECIAL REVIEW
Maturing Mulaney

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

In the three years since John 

Mulaney’s last stand-up special, 
the 33-year-old entertainer has 
gotten 
mar-

ried, bought a 
house and cre-
ated one abject 
failure of a sit-
com. Yes, it’s 
hard to believe 
that 
someone 

as 
witty 
as 

Mulaney could 
create 
some-

thing as unfun-
ny as last year’s 
“Mulaney,” but 
the comedian persists with his 
new special, “John Mulaney: The 
Comeback Kid.”

Performing in The Chicago 

Theatre, Mulaney never direct-
ly addresses his experience of 
making a failed TV series, but 
the challenges of change make 
themselves clearly present. With 
an oddly boyish appearance, the 
comic seems to defy aging itself 
— but that doesn’t stop an aging 
point of view.

The 
girlfriend 
Mulaney 

referred to in “New in Town,” 
Annamarie Tendler, is now the 
stand-up’s wife in “The Come-
back Kid.” At one point, Mulaney 
says someone warned him, “Why 
buy the cow when you can get the 
milk for free?” in regards to his 
marriage. Mulaney’s penchant 
for breaking down the inherent 
insanity of certain subjects comes 
into play as he points out the ini-
tially insulting and nonsensical 
meaning behind the statement. 
He also uses the arguments own 
logic against itself. “Why buy 
the cow?” he asks himself before 
answering, “Because everyday 
the cow asks you when you’re 
going to buy it.” Mulaney contin-
ues, “Because a lot of people think 
that you like bulls,” before con-
cluding, “because you love her.”

Mulaney’s delivery and abil-

ity to inhabit several characters 
allows his setups to take shape, 
portraying memories as slightly 
absurd reimaginings. In one 
instance, Mulaney describes his 
grouchy French bulldog as an 

old French woman who easily 
asserts her Alpha status over the 
Mulaney household, prompting 
a dog trainer to tell him, “You 
need to show dominance over 
your puppy.” “These are things 
people say to me,” the comedian 
marvels at his own weakness.

But there is a growing matu-

rity in the man. This isn’t the 
guy who gets pushed around 
by Delta Airlines in “New In 
Town.” Instead, Mulaney is able 
to assertively ask that his wife 
board the plane with him. Yet, 
the man’s childishness never 
escapes him. Filled with refer-
ences to ’80s and ’90s hallmarks 
like “Back to the Future,” “Saved 
by the Bell” and Jonathan Taylor 
Thomas, “The Comeback Kid” 
paints a picture of Mulaney’s 
adolescence, applies a univer-
sality to it and contemplates the 
encroaching concept of adult-
hood. “I am very small and I have 
no money. So you can imagine the 
kind of stress that I am under,” 
Mulaney says of his mindset as a 
child, but also capturing the Mil-
lennial experience.

Mulaney’s parents are promi-

nent figures in his special, espe-
cially his father, lawyer Charles 
Mulaney. Starting as background 
figures, the parents become a 
recurring theme throughout the 
performance as Mulaney sees 
that they aren’t so different. At 
one point Mulaney tells how his 
father, with a car full of children, 
went into a McDonald’s drive-
through, and ordered a single cup 
of black coffee. Despite child-
hood frustration, Mulaney says, 
“In retrospect that is the funniest 

thing I’ve seen in my entire life,” 
as he calls his dad his hero.

Mulaney closes his set with an 

extended look into a childhood 
memory, much like he did with 
the Salt and Pepper Diner closer 
from 2009’s “The Top Part.” Now, 
the comedian details the time 
he met Bill Clinton, the political 
Comeback Kid, during his first 
presidential campaign. Amid rec-
ollections of the finale of “The 
Fugitive” and his parents’ clash-
ing ideologies, young Mulaney is 
swept up in childhood wonder at 
meeting the personable Clinton. 
This contrasts with his father’s 
cynicism towards the future pres-
ident, an outlook punctuated by 
the bit’s final act of irony.

At one point, Mulaney remem-

bers an old employer, Mr. Finch, 
who once said that he was “Too 
old to be a duckling.” The odd 
statement 
perplexes 
Mulaney 

every day, but it begins to take 
on meaning as “The Comeback 
Kid” comes to a close. Mulaney 
has changed; he’s too old as well. 
His views have shifted with time 
and what was simple becomes 
complex. Youth has left Mulaney 
behind and has been replaced by 
the responsibility of adulthood. 
He looks back at his childhood 
fondly but he doesn’t disregard 
its difficulties. This ubiquitous 
challenge faced by all ages is 
emphasized in Mulaney’s final 
story where obligation trumps 
personal opinion. Despite his own 
struggles, Mulaney’s witty sense 
of humor continues to persevere, 
allowing him to communicate 
growing up in a way that only he 
can.

STYLE NOTEBOOK
Annual V.S. show’s 
promising advances

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Arts Writer

The 20th annual Victoria’s 

Secret fashion show was filmed 
on Nov. 10, but the peasantry of 
the world will have to wait until 
Dec. 8 to see it aired on CBS.

This year’s show ushers in a 

new league of showstoppers, 
after long-time, iconic Angels 
Karlie 
Kloss 
and 
Doutzens 

Kroes walked their final Victo-
ria’s Secret show last year.

Ten models were anointed 

to be Angels this year, but all 
eyes will be on the rookies. 
While nine models will walk 
in this particular show for the 
first time, two of them seem to 
be attracting all of the media 
attention — top models of the 
year, Kendall Jenner and Gigi 
Hadid. Jenner was asked to 
walk last year, but chose to do 
the Chanel show instead.

Hadid has modeled for Guess, 

Versace and starred in several 
music videos, but for the past 
two years has been denied a 
spot in the Victoria’s Secret 
show. Her acceptance this year 
is undoubtedly partly due to her 
rise to fame as part of T-Swift’s 
girl squad (I kid you not) and 
friendship with Jenner, but 
Hadid put in a lot of work too — 
becoming and being an Angel is 
far from angelic. Many women 
work all year to maintain a star 
physique — only to be denied 
one of the 47 spots in the show.

In a video the company 

uploaded to YouTube as part 
of a series on how the show is 
produced, casting director John 
Pfeiffer said out of the 400 to 
500 model submissions, he sees 

300 auditions and two days of 
callbacks for around 100 girls.

But, as the show hits its 

20-year mark, it becomes a time 
to look back on what (if any-
thing) has been accomplished 
by it. The program and brand 
have consistently shown one 
unique and extremely demand-
ing body type: thin, tall, light 
girls with long hair, washboard 
abs and thigh gaps as wide as 
the Grand Canyon.

All of which comes at an 

incredibly demanding physi-
cal price for an industry that 
doesn’t pay what it used to. 
According to Business Insider, 
contracts for veteran models 
like Alessandra Ambrosio are 
in the millions whereas newer 
models are only offered a 10th 
of that.

For some models, the time 

requirements and stress to stay 
in shape isn’t worth the pay — 
Kroes left Victoria’s Secret for 
better pay in Europe. Famous 
Angel Miranda Kerr allegedly 
left because Victoria’s Secret’s 
extensive demands.

The narrow, demanding body 

requirements both pushes mod-
els out and prevents them from 
joining in the first place. Volup-
tuous Kate Upton was denied 
for her body type, despite being 
named “Sexiest Woman Alive” 
by People Magazine.

The brand has said it wants 

women to not only be attractive, 
but likeable to other women — 
insinuating that Upton’s shape 
and sex appeal deems her 
unmarketable to other females. 
If women don’t like the model, 
they won’t buy the bralette.

Hadid — while not exactly 

“thick” and nowhere near “fat” 
— represents somewhat of a 
deviation from the wafer model 
type, and has had to address 
criticism online because of it. 
Accepting Hadid into the show 
is a good start — if only an 
increment forward.

However, the most monu-

mental change to the show was 
the brand allowing Angolan 
model Maria Borges walk her 
third show with natural hair. 
Past shows have been predomi-
nantly filled with long strands 
of straight and softly waved 
hair. Essence reported that 
Borges told her agent to ask 
Victoria’s Secret if they would 
allow her to walk with her natu-
ral hair.

“I was nervous, but I had to 

do it,” Borges said. “When they 
said ‘yes,’ I didn’t expect it, but 
I was so happy!”

This approval marks another 

step forward in diversifying the 
appearance of the show, but, 
overall, Victoria’s Secret show 
has a long way to go before 
breaking the mold.

The show is great voyeur-

ism: it’s extravagant “fantasy,” 
and with musical stars like this 
year’s Ellie Goulding, Selena 
Gomez and The Weeknd, it’s fun 
to watch. But it should be taken 
at face value: a “fantasy.” If you 
do tune in, watch it over cheesy 
bread and wine with your girl-
friends. Watch it for Selena 
Gomez, who looked bomb in a 
low cut black gown (or for her 
drama with JB). Watch it for the 
fashion, but don’t watch it for 
the bodies. These women are 
genetically blessed and work 
hard all year to perfect it.

FILM NOTEBOOK
‘Room’ is the perfect 
coming-of-age film

By JACOB RICH

Daily Film Editor

Spoilers for “Room” to follow. 

You should go see “Room.” It’s a 
great film and this won’t make any 
sense unless you’ve seen it.

“Room,” a film currently sus-

pended in a sea of Oscar-buzz, is 
difficult to confine within a single 
genre. It’s billed as a thriller, but, 
being about the imprisonment 
and rape of a teenage girl by a ter-
rifying criminal, the label “hor-
ror” may be a better fit; there’s 
no lack of horrific imagery here. 
However, the most apt genre to 
classify “Room” with is one that 
has, so far, rarely been assigned to 
it by critics: “Room” is a coming-
of-age film.

“Room” doesn’t have cute teen-

agers, nostalgic music, first sexual 
experiences or gross-out humor 
(the usual codifiers of the genre). 
Rather, “Room” ’s two-act struc-
ture depicts the central theme of 
the genre: a passage, from child-
hood into adulthood.

In the first act, we are intro-

duced to Jack and his mother 
Joy, the captives. Jack was born 
in Room, and has never seen any-
thing outside of it. He is not aware 
of the limitations of his existence; 
Room is his existence. Given the 
circumstances, he’s a happy and 
healthy kid. He’s still a little kid 
running about, taking pleasure in 
playing with toys and interacting 
with his mother.

Then, he turns five. His mother 

considers him old enough to learn 
the truth: They’re captives, and 
they can’t leave.

This is the moment, an exclu-

sively human explosion of con-
sciousness we all experience at 
different times in our lives: we 

discover exactly who, what and 
where we are. These are concepts 
that are vaguely known in child-
hood but don’t really come into 
complete 
understanding 
until 

young adulthood.

It’s a vastly important moment 

of self-reflection, but not usually 
a pleasant one. The ego is formed. 
Here enters the haziness and 
murkiness of reality, the realiza-
tion that we aren’t a floating con-
sciousness that has always been 
and always will be, but a thorough-
ly mortal biological construct. 
There may be more out there, but 
we have no method of understand-
ing it. We are alone together. We 
are not complacent; we are limited, 
and our time is running out.

We 
understand 
now 
that 

“Room” is not unfamiliar to us. 
“Room” is our new reality when 
we hit this point in our lives. Now 
that we understand what we are, 
we have a pervasive discomfort 
that bleeds into everything that 
was once simple and easy. While 
the physical manifestation of 
“Room” in the film is given context 
and emotional weight as a terrify-
ing situation of imprisonment and 
abuse, it also represents this more 

mundane sense of understanding.

Joy and Jack do not escape 

“Room” when they leave its 
walls. They’re still prisoners of 
their reality. Beyond the initial 
catharsis of their observed free-
dom, they cannot find a way to 
escape the humanity that they 
were born into.

Their freedom only comes 

when they re-examine their 
reality. The final scene, in which 
the pair returns to their place 
of captivity, finally puts the two 
at peace. They look at each part 
of Room unblinkingly. Through 
acceptance, they are able to 
enjoy their lives again. No lon-
ger are they stuck within the 
turmoil, the hatred of their own 
understanding. This is adult-
hood.

No, “Room” does not aestheti-

cally resemble the traditional 
coming-of-age films like “The 
Breakfast 
Club,” 
“American 

Pie” and “Almost Famous.” But 
it does explore similar themes, 
and represents a similar pas-
sage. “Room” is a primal film, a 
harrowing and emotional explo-
ration of what it’s like to compre-
hend one’s humanity.

“On the bright side, we’re in a perfect coming-of-age film.”


various 
forms 
of 
inspiration. 

Pulling from the “trippy colors of 
my grandfather’s painting” to the 
production styles of producers 
like Steve Osbourne to the mental 
space she was in at the time, 
Carlton was able to construct her 
most peaceful, minimalist, folk-
inspired album.

“There’s something about being 

minimal and presenting just the 
essentials. I think that I had, in the 
past, come from a flamboyance,” 
Carlton said. “And I love dynamics 
in music and I think that we were 
still able to achieve that with 
Liberman, but I wanted the album 
to reflect where I was at. It had to 
be more peaceful.”

While still a little melancholy 

in the lyrics, Carlton uses her 
angelic voice and piano to create 
something 
that 
soothes. 
She 

self-describes the album as a 
“background sound album,” one 
that can delicately fill up the dead 
air of any backroom, bus, small 
gathering or late-night drink. And 
in this projected goal, Carlton 
undoubtedly 
succeeded. 
She 

produced half of Liberman with 
Steve Osbourne, a multi-platinum 
selling British music producer. 

Carlton, who loved his production 
stylings with the Doves, worked 
with Osbourne previously on 
Rabbits on the Run.

In describing her work with 

Osbourne, Carlton recounted the 
“incredible learning curve” that 
Osbourne initially presented.

“He is so incredibly talented,” 

Carlton said. “And I decided that 
I wanted to go further down this 
musical path with him. I wanted 
to go more into his sonic world.”

Specifically, Carlton praised 

Osbourne for helping her to 
harness her voice to assume a role 
as one of the most strongly featured 
instruments of the album. In this 
Osbourne-inspired 
endeavor, 

Carlton once again succeeded; 
songs like “Take It Easy” and 
“House of Seven Swords” reveal 
the intense prettiness of her 
refined vocal range.

In her live performance at The 

Blind Pig this past Saturday night, 
the effortless beauty of Vanessa’s 
talents 
were 
revealed. 
The 

minimalist stylings of the music, a 
sound so streamlined it was almost 
tangible, matched the nominal 
objects that decorated the stage: It 
was nothing but a piano, Carlton’s 
violinist and scattered lit candles. 
Silence 
spread 
through 
the 

crowd when Vanessa interjected 
some light commentary into her 

relatively short, hourlong set. The 
fans kept their beguiled eyes on 
Carlton for the entirety of the set, 
while whispered, light hummings 
of lyric repetition was a constant 
underlying sound in the packed 
Blind Pig.

Acoustic 
versions 
of 
“A 

Thousand Miles” and “White 
Houses” 
were 
undeniably 

enchanting for the crowd of college 
kids who had grown up with 
these radio hits. Carlton jokingly 
offered up some context for each 
of the songs as the peeled eyes and 
whispered voices fell back into love 
with this early 2000s sensation.

Carlton could be considered 

lucky: Very few early popstar 
one-hit wonders tend to resurface 
successfully or without great 
difficulty. 
Surely, 
Carlton 

experienced this stereotypical 
plight in some form, but she 
seems to have arisen as a stronger 
artist because of it. After years 
of allowing the media to nurture 
some false image of her, Carlton 
has built herself up, once again, 
with the same building blocks 
that had always remained: talent, 
depth, beauty and a determined 
vision for one’s craft. What was 
once stolen has now been won 
back, to be nurtured and expand 
upon once again, with far fewer 
Dr. Scholl’s jokes this time around.

ALBUM REVIEW
Cara’s strong debut

Hit single ‘Here’ 
highlights new 

album Know-It-All

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

The first time I Googled Ales-

sia Cara, I was shocked to see the 
year 1996 on my laptop screen. In 
addition to hav-
ing 
two 
first 

names, 
being 

Canadian 
and 

already scoring 
a sleeper hit in 
her maple-leafed 
homeland, Cara 
is only 19 years 
old. I say “only” 
because I am also 19, and like Cara, 
I’m straddling the wobbly bound-
ary between youth and adulthood, 
and sometimes I like to write 
about it. But unlike Cara, I can’t 
sing about it; I don’t have a voice 
like liquid silver, like silk hanging 
out the window on a cool, breezy 
night. She does, though. And if 
I gleaned anything from Know-
It-All, Ms. Cara’s excellent debut 
album, it’s that more people should 
be listening to her voice.

“Here” is the aforementioned 

smash, the second tune off the 
album and easily its best work. So 
far it has peaked at #20 in Canada 
and #13 in the U.S., and rightfully 
so: it toys with the (admittedly 
relatable) subject of not wanting 
to be at a party anymore, getting 
bored with the do-you-have-a-
boyfriend cajoles, all on top of 
piano-infused R&B sounds. We 
get the summit of Cara’s sardonic 
lyrics: “So holla at me I’ll be in the 
car when you’re done / I’m stand-
offish, don’t want what you’re 
offering / And I’m done talking / 
Awfully sad it had to be that way.” 
She sounds like a cynical Alicia 
Keys, spitting out smoky pleas 
and biting observations capped 
off with expert vibrato. It’s been 
a while since a track has captured 
the ennui of burned out youth so 
inventively, so well.

Know-It-All continues strongly, 

and “Four Pink Walls” and “Out-
laws” keep the energy alive. The 
latter is doo-wop done right — a 
modern tune through and through, 
with apt ’50s drive-in influences. 

It never crosses into hammy ter-
ritory, nor does it reek of pseudo-
feministic lyrics (cough, Meghan 
Trainor, cough), and Cara’s voice is 
potent enough to set it apart from 
most of the album’s other poppy 
songs. “Four Pink Walls” is just as 
great: as a funky, personal ode to 
dreams with chunks of piano and 
jazzy chord progressions, it sounds 
straight off Amy Winehouse’s 
Frank. Cara takes many genres for 
a walk on this compilation, and 
it’s an experiment conducted with 
caution and grace.

However, when you hit so many 

high notes, low ones are inevitable. 
Too many of Know-It-All’s songs 
fall into the rabbit hole of pop typi-
cality: “Overdose,” “I’m Yours,” 
“Wild Things” and “Scars To Your 
Beautiful” are the prime examples 
of this “basic” state of being. All 
four blend into each other with 
minimal offerings of distinguish-
ability. The verses are the sounding 
board for similar, less-than-grip-
ping lyrics, and the choruses fol-
low trite melodic lines. “Wild 
Things” mentions 808 drums, like 
so many other tunes of today. (A 
note: We can trace the zenith of 
what I’ve dubbed the “808 Plague” 
to Ke$ha’s 2010 sensation “Your 
Love Is My Drug,” where she says, 
“Do I make your heart beat like an 
808 drum?” After years of its pro-
lific mention in album titles and 
songs, I thought Ke$ha’s reference 
would mark its demise. But the 
808 Plague is still festering. Please 
contact your local physician if you 
feel it coming over you. We can end 
this together.)

So maybe it was my youth or my 

ennui or my aversion to the basic, 

but I found myself pining to click 
pause and play “Here” again a little 
too often while listening to Know-
It-All. Alas, plague-free unique-
ness is alluring.

Cara turns it around on a few 

shiny beacons, like “Stars.” A 
stripped-down yet robust piano 
ballad, “Stars” deals with “shed-
ding off the sun” while falling in 
love and accepting one another’s 
faults and potential simultane-
ously. Cara’s voice pierces through 
the track like an oh-so-gentle 
dagger, and the minimalist back-
ground gives her the confidence 
to push those million-dollar pipes 
even harder. Laced with some 
dissonant chords toward the end 
— something “Stone,” the album’s 
more lackadaisical ballad, is miss-
ing — “Stars” absolutely shines. 

It’s tricky to critique an artist 

with an indubitably stellar voice. 
Things like production, backing 
vocals and album instrumenta-
tion are easy to overlook when 
a voice like Cara’s is fighting for 
its life in the cruel realm of my 
19-year-old headphones. So even 
“Seventeen,” yet another basic 
tune, is hard to deny: it’s catchy, 
it’s typical, but it’s Cara. She’s 
singing about freezing time, about 
wanting to grow up but realizing 
that it’s not all it’s cracked up to 
be — and she’s doing it with that 
silvery voice of hers.

And then a few days later you 

find yourself at that drunk party, 
with all these people you don’t 
want to be with, listening to music 
you don’t really like, just yearning 
to be chilling with yourself and 
doing things that feed your soul. 
Like listening to Alessia Cara.

LITERATURE COLUMN

My Maryland story
I 

had barely walked past my 
English professor’s door 
when I saw the map. Upon 

closer inspection, I noticed it 
was adorned with small, curlicue 
letters list-
ing titles of 
books within 
defined state 
borders.

This map 

is called “The 
United States 
of Books,” 
and when I 
couldn’t stop 
thinking 
about it and tried to find it online 
later, I found multiple variations 
of this list. There are maps that 
showed the most popular books 
set in their respective state, the 
book most frequently purchased 
in each state, and several that try 
to claim that one book can serve as 
a representative for an entire state.

I have mixed feelings about this 

claim. “Where are you from?” is 
often the first or second friendly 
question we get when meeting 
new people. (The other being the 
unremitting “What do you do?” 
or the collegiate translation of 
“What’s your major?”)

So to have literature intercede 

and do some of the work for us 
— essentially, assigning responsi-
bility for the identity of a state to 
a particular book — is a strange 
idea. I say this mostly because the 
book that allegedly represents my 
state is foreign to me.

I’m from Maryland, but I was 

born in Washington, D.C., about 
15 miles away from my house. 
I grew up my entire life in the 
house that my parents and dogs 
still occupy. In the suburbs of 
D.C., I had a very happy child-
hood, owing mostly to my parents, 
brother and grandmother who 
acted as a third parent, but also 
due in large part to my location. I 
had a backyard to run around and 
play in, I could walk safely to my 
friends’ houses, I could kayak on 
the Potomac River with my dad or 
bike the 16 miles to Georgetown 
with my best friend on the C&O 
Canal. My house is close enough 
to D.C. that I can easily get to 
the Lincoln Memorial or get the 
sushi tacos that Maryland lacks, 
but traffic isn’t as affected by the 
hassles of endless diplomatic and 
presidential motorcades the way it 
would be if I lived there.

It sounds like the best of both 

worlds, and it was. But the 18 
years I spent in Bethesda are not 
represented in the book that was 
chosen to symbolize my state. The 
Maryland book that is on the list 
on my English professor’s door 
is “The Accidental Tourist,” by 
Ann Tyler. I picked it up from the 
library on my way home that day, 
and it’s phenomenal. But I didn’t 
relate to it as a Marylander.

“The Accidental Tourist” is set 

in Baltimore, about an hour from 
Bethesda. But the novel doesn’t 
focus on its location or in any 
way make Baltimore come to life. 
“The Accidental Tourist” could 
be located anywhere, really. Loca-
tion isn’t important to this novel 
— it was a finalist for the Pulitzer 
Prize and won the National Book 
Award for fiction not because of 
the few times that it mentions that 
the characters live in Baltimore, 
but because of the narrative and 
compelling characters. Tyler’s 
books are distinctively American. 
As a reviewer highlighted when it 
came out, “(Tyler) has taken as her 
fictional territory that sprawling 
American landscape of the middle 
class.” “The Accidental Tourist” is 
a book that explores the complexi-
ties of the American family. But 
the next time someone asks me 
where I’m from, I couldn’t rely on 
“The Accidental Tourist” to tell 
my story of Maryland.

So I thought about what 

novel could. I found it in about 
10 seconds of racking my brain: 
“The Sisterhood of the Traveling 
Pants.”

When I picked up that familiar 

book again, my recollections of 
the four best friends of different 

body types that can magically fit 
into the same pair of jeans were 
spot on. In the first few pages, I 
realized how close the experi-
ences of these girls were to my 
experiences when I was 16 and 
desperately wanted to leave the 
idyllic childhood I described with 
joy earlier. I saw the common 
white lies of my friends to the 
ceaseless “Where are you from?” 
quandary in the response of 
Bridget, a Bethesda native, who 
casually replies, “I’m from Wash-
ington, D.C.” And as Carmen, 
another one of the narrators, 
says in the first few pages “It’s 
not enough to stay in Bethesda, 
Maryland, and hunker down in 
an air conditioned house.”

But the simultaneous boredom 

and pleasure of suburbia is not 
unique to Bethesda, or Maryland. 
The same location problems 
can be found in Jeffrey Eugen-
ides’s “The Virgin Suicides” and 
Jonathan Franzen’s “Freedom,” 
which are set in Michigan and 
Minnesota, respectively.

When the structure and ideals 

of a place is as easily reproducible 
as those of my hometown — good 
schools, competition over every-
thing imaginable, open spaces 
for kids to ride their bikes or get 
high — it makes that location, at 
least in a literary sense, standard 
and routine. For these books, nar-
rative takes enormous precedent 
over where the characters are. 
A suburban backdrop for a novel 
can often be put in any state.

The list of books that repre-

sent states should be looking for 
the strange and the uncanny 
found to represent each state. 
This is easier to do with states 
that can more easily embody 
particular ideals. On most lists, 
Hawaii is captured by “The 
Descendants.” “Gone with the 
Wind” is almost always chosen 
for Georgia. I’ll admit, I haven’t 
spent much time in these states 
and maybe that’s why I’m more 
willing to accept these asser-
tions. I love stories where the 
setting can become more of a 
character than a background. 
When I read that John Hughes 
described “Ferris Bueller’s Day 
Off” as his love letter to Chicago, 
I wanted to find something simi-
lar for the places I hold close to 
me, even when I’m hundreds of 
miles away.

I haven’t yet. I love “The Sis-

terhood of the Traveling Pants” 
— it makes me think of my past, 
complete with all the frustrations 
and beauty of suburbia. When I 
go back for my summers in this 
perilous place between teenage 
angst and adult realization, I 
can’t also go back to identifying 
with the story of the four teen-
agers who refuse to wash their 
jeans. I’m not afraid to ask for 
a better story from Maryland 
because I think that it can deliver. 
In the meantime, I’ll be waiting.

Playoff mindset drives 
Harbaugh, Wolverines

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan football team has 

taken its share of lumps in recent 
weeks. The Wolverines have won 
three games in a row against lesser 
opponents, but two of the victories 
have come because of last-second 
stands by the defense.

Making matters worse, injuries 

have taken their toll. Redshirt 
junior defensive tackle Ryan 
Glasgow is likely out for the season 
with a pectoral injury, adding 
to the decimation of a defensive 
front that was already playing 
without 
sophomore 
defensive 

tackle Bryan Mone and senior 
defensive end Mario Ojemudia.

It’s 
plausible 
that 
those 

absences 
led 
to 
Saturday’s 

struggles against the run, in 
which Michigan’s defense, once 
the best in the nation, surrendered 
307 yards on the ground.

Still, 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh insisted Monday that 
his players are not downtrodden 
in the least heading into the final 
two games of the regular season.

“No one’s acting beat up that I 

know of,” Harbaugh said.

“We’ve got a bounce in our step. 

We’re ready to go.”

Harbaugh likened the final 

stretch of the season to when 
he was a kid playing pickup 
basketball during the summer at 
Pattengill Elementary School in 
Ann Arbor. The kids who won the 
game stayed on, and Harbaugh’s 
goal was always to play until it 
was time for lunch.

The college football equivalent 

to lunch, Harbaugh said, would be 
playing in the championship game 
of the College Football Playoff. He 
has stressed the playoff mentality 

to his players. If they lose to Penn 
State or Ohio State, their season 
will culminate in a bowl game 
without the opportunity to play 
for the Big Ten championship 
in Indianapolis or even a less 
probable national title.

“I personally love the playoff 

type of situation and atmosphere,” 
Harbaugh said. “You win, you get 
to keep playing.”

Senior 
linebacker 
Royce 

Jenkins-Stone said the possibility 
of 
winning 
the 
Big 
Ten 

championship has motivated the 
players throughout the season. It 
has been the clear end goal for the 
team all season long.

For most of the season, though, 

the 
players 
have 
preferred 

to discuss the game in front 
of them rather than the big 
picture. However, the thought of 

advancing past the game against 
the Buckeyes has crossed their 
minds on many occasions.

“If you haven’t thought about 

playing in Indianapolis (for the 
Big Ten Championship Game) or 
playing in the top four, you’re in 
the wrong place,” said senior tight 
end A.J. Williams. “Especially 
with the position we’re in, we’ve 
just got to handle our business, 
and if it’s meant for us to be there, 
then we have to be.”

Williams said the Wolverines 

don’t need vocal reminders about 
the importance of the final two 
games of the regular season. 
They know the stakes and are 
not avoiding them. They see 
the scenarios when they peruse 
Twitter, and they know exactly 
what needs to happen.

“If things go a certain way, 

Indianapolis, here we come,” 
Williams said.

The 
most 
likely 
scenario 

for the division to play out in 
Michigan’s favor involves some 
help from Ohio State. Before his 
press conference ended Monday, 
Harbaugh was asked if he will be 
rooting for the Buckeyes to beat 
Michigan State on Saturday. If 
that occurs, and the Wolverines 
beat Penn State, then Michigan 
will play Ohio State for the Big 
Ten East title on Nov. 28. The 
winner would advance to the Big 
Ten Championship Game.

Harbaugh 
deflected 
the 

question, referring to his earlier 
pickup basketball analogy in 
explaining that he cares only 
about his team’s performance.

“There was only one court at 

Pattengill,” Harbaugh said.

MEN’S TENNIS
Lin upsets No. 1 
seed in tourney

Michigan wraps 
up fall season with 
Florida tournament

By KATIE CONKLIN

Daily Sports Writer

Entering 
the 
quarterfinal 

round at the Lakewood Ranch 
Intercollegiate 
Clay 
Classic 

this past weekend, Michigan 
men’s tennis sophomore Carter 
Lin was the underdog. Though 
matched up with the No. 1 seed 
in the tournament, Princeton’s 
Tom Colautti, Lin did have an 
advantage: he was playing in his 
hometown of Lakewood Ranch, 
Fla.

Lin went into the match 

not intent on winning, but on 
improving specific components 
of his play. The alternative 
approach was successful, with 
Lin coming out on top after 
splitting the first two sets.

“Each of (the players) had 

something 
specific 
they 

were working 
on,” 
said 

Michigan 
associate head 
coach 
Sean 

Maymi. “(We 
don’t) 
stress 

so much about 
how we we’re 
going to win this match, but 
more of how we’re going to go 
about it and the process.”

The 
team, 
described 
by 

Maymi as well balanced, is 
looking forward to its spring 
season, which starts Jan. 23. 
Until then, the Wolverines’ 
main 
focus 
is 
day-by-day 

development.

Such development is what 

has earned Lin positive results 
during 
recent 
match 
play. 

Though Lin was not able to 
pull out a win in the semifinal 
against 
Minnesota’s 
Ruben 

Weber, his coaches have noticed 
progress since his arrival in Ann 
Arbor last January.

“He’s put forth good effort 

to make sure he’s a staple in 
our lineup,” Maymi said. “He’s 
consistently one of the hardest-
working guys.”

Leaving Florida on Sunday 

evening, 
the 
Wolverines 

wrapped up their fall season 
and are looking forward to play 
in 2016. Between now and then, 
individual effort is crucial.

“You 
find 
out 
whether 

(individual 
players) 
are 

going to be successful when 
they’re doing it themselves 
and practicing on their own,” 
Maymi said.

Maymi, along with the rest of 

Michigan’s coaching staff, will 
have keen eyes when analyzing 
the players on their return for 

spring season. 
They will be 
looking 
for 

improvement, 
whether 
it 

be 
advances 

in 
skill 
or 

physicality, or 
both.

Finishing 

off 
the 

fall season on a high note is 
a positive, according to the 
coaching staff, but singular 
success is neither the program’s 
intention nor its destination.

“Doing 
well 
in 
one 

tournament doesn’t do much 
for us unless the whole group 
continues to get better,” Maymi 
said. “There’s still a lot of work 
to go.”

“He’s consistently 
one of the hardest-

working guys.”

Rudock, Chesson finally click, 
combine for four touchdowns

Passing game 

combo finds long-
awaited connection 

against Indiana

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Jehu 
Chesson 
remembers 

when he first met Jake Rudock.

Rudock hadn’t even finished 

unpacking after his move from 
Iowa City, let alone gotten to 
know his new teammates, but the 
fifth-year senior quarterback had 
secured a summer job in his new 
city Ann Arbor.

For Chesson — a redshirt 

junior wide receiver who had 
spent much of the past decade 
working side jobs to make ends 
meet — that was the best first 
impression he could have hoped 
for.

“It says something about his 

character and his willingness to 
serve others,” Chesson said over 
the summer. “You want that kind 
of guy at quarterback.”

Living across the street, the 

two quickly connected. Chesson 
invited Rudock to join a number 
of teammates at regular games 
of Monopoly to get to know the 
team, and it took Rudock less 
than a week to ask Chesson to 
run routes.

Given Rudock’s status as the 

newest Wolverine, many would 
see the advances as forward. 
But Chesson is the fastest player 
on the team — he didn’t mind 
moving quickly.

“He was just always there, 

always ready to work,” Chesson 
said. “Other people might see that 
as weird, but that’s something 
I noticed and respected right 
away.”

Though 
the 
quarterback-

receiver relationship didn’t take 
long to begin, it took months for 
it to blossom on the field.

Through 
seven 
games, 

Chesson had just 190 yards 
receiving and no touchdowns 

in the air. Rudock was mulling 
through below-average numbers 
in the Big Ten — primarily relying 
on short passes to tight ends and 
running backs. The pair had all 
the skills and connections to 
make big plays, but in the game, 
the ball would fall a foot short, or 
Chesson would miss by a couple 
steps.

After mustering just 23 points 

as an offense and narrowly 
missing several big plays in a 
loss to Michigan State, the pair 
entered the bye week with a 
mission.

“The coaches don’t sugarcoat 

anything,” Chesson said. “They 
told us we needed to track the 
deep ball better.”

So the two reignited their 

summer pastime of route running 
after practice.

Others joined, of course, but it 

was clear that the speedy Chesson 
and Rudock, whom Chesson said 
makes “full-speed decisions,” had 
a special connection.

The connection heated up 

against Minnesota and Rutgers, 
as 
Rudock 
showed 
marked 

improvement 
and 
Chesson 

secured 
three 
receiving 

touchdowns.

Then, in a shootout against 

Indiana, five months’ worth of 
work reached a boiling point.

In the 48-41 win, Rudock 

set a school record with six 
touchdowns and 440 passing 
yards. 
Chesson 
was 
at 
the 

receiving end of 207 of those 
yards 
and 

four of those 
touchdowns, 
tying a school 
record 
set 

by 
Derrick 

Alexander 
in 

1992.

Both efforts 

were historic, 
and it was only 
fitting that the 
two shared Big Ten Offensive 
Player of the Week honors.

“Sometimes it could just be 

a matter or inches or feet,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 

“What does water boil at? 212 
(degrees)? 212 it boils, 211 it 
doesn’t. 213 is the magic number. 
… I would agree it’s been close, 
and now it’s boiling. It’s good. 
Bodes well for us.”

With the surge in productivity, 

Harbaugh has 
noted that both 
are 
playing 

at a level that 
deserves NFL 
consideration. 
Chesson 
and 

Rudock 
had 

relatively quiet 
careers before 
this 
season, 

but Harbaugh 

feels that with the deep ball 
finally connecting, their games 
are becoming complete.

“It was just the constant 

improvement in all phases of his 

game,” Harbaugh said of Chesson 
on Monday. “I think the one 
thing he is improving at, the final 
piece, is tracking the deep ball. 
You watch him run, you watch 
him catch, you watch him block, 
cover kicks, the way he plays in 
all phases and now the deep ball. 
… You see that improving, and I 
think that’s the final piece that 
he’s acquiring.”

Rudock and Chesson are no 

longer just bonding over summer 
jobs, but over their outputs on 
the field. With arguably the two 
toughest defenses Michigan will 
face this season still remaining 
on the schedule, the deep-ball 
connection that started months 
ago is finally clicking.

And for the quick-running 

Chesson and the quick-thinking 
Rudock, it couldn’t come a 
moment too soon.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Munger quickly 
fitting into role

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

Nicole Munger couldn’t have 

asked for a better start to her 
Michigan career.

The freshman guard co-led the 

Wolverines in scoring on Saturday 
against 
Binghamton 
with 
19 

points, while shooting 7-for-11 
from the field. She followed that 
performance with a five-point, 
four-rebound outing at Detroit on 
Sunday.

Now that last year’s go-to 

scoring option off the bench 
— sophomore guard Katelynn 
Flaherty — has become a fixture 
in the starting lineup, Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico has been 
searching for the player who can 
sub in and provide an instant 
spark. Perhaps sooner than she 
might have expected, Barnes Arico 
chose Munger to fill that role.

“I 
think 
she 
is 
definitely 

challenging for a starting spot 
every day,” Barnes Arico said. “But 
I also really like that you have that 
spark coming off the bench right 
now too, which has provided us 
with a tremendous amount of 
energy, instant offense and also 
energy on the defensive end.”

Right from the start of last 

season, Flaherty shot from all over 
the court and put up impressive 
scoring numbers in her first 
appearances as well, scoring 15 
and 14 points in her first two 
college appearances, respectively. 
Munger posted a similar average, 
and has done so playing fewer 
minutes than Flaherty.

Unlike Munger, Flaherty was 

forced prematurely into a starting 
role in her first few games in a 
Michigan uniform, and that’s 
a decision Barnes Arico came 
to regret in the long run. After 
moving her to the bench, Barnes 
Arico noticed Flaherty was more 
comfortable when she got an 
idea of the pace of the game after 
observing from the sideline for a 
few minutes.

The 
change 
benefited 

Flaherty’s 
confidence 
and 

ultimately earned her the Big Ten 
Sixth Player of the Year. Barnes 
Arico is hoping the same for 
Munger.

“With freshmen, sometimes 

it’s kind of a work in progress,” 
Barnes Arico said. “We realized 
that with Flaherty last year 
when she didn’t start, then did 
start, then she didn’t. It was nice 
for (Munger in) the first couple 
minutes to let the game come to 
her and see what was happening 
before she got out there, and we’ll 
see how that goes with Nicole.”

While Munger and Flaherty 

can both shoot the ball lights-
out and serve as the Wolverines’ 
sixth player, their similarities 
end there. Flaherty’s game last 
year was largely based on finesse, 
and she lacked the dominant, 
physical presence that Munger 
has exhibited.

Munger led the Wolverines with 

three steals against the Bobcats, 
and full-out dove for loose balls 
any chance she got this weekend.

Munger’s work ethic is her 

greatest strength at the moment, 
and what Barnes Arico loves 
about her the most. The freshman 
consistently 
comes 
early 
to 

get some shooting in before 
practice, and at one point made 30 
consecutive 3-pointers, according 
to Barnes Arico. The coach has 
had to look outside the team for 
a comparison about Munger’s 
desire to get better.

“I’ve watched the guys for 

three years now come in and how 
(Michigan men’s basketball senior 
guard Caris LeVert) comes into 
the gym at every extra second that 
he’s had since his freshman year,” 
Barnes Arico said. “And now I 
can say that about Nicole. Now, 
we have someone in our program 
that’s a Caris LeVert.”

Despite the pressure of lofty 

comparisons so early in her career, 
Munger has shown no signs of 
slowing down. If the freshman 
can continue to work at the levels 
that have garnered Barnes Arico’s 
praise, Michigan could have a 
special talent on its hands.

Freshman Moritz Wagner (right) has worked his way into Michigan’s rotation.
Michigan’s big men 
getting opportunity

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

After his team’s regular-season 

opener on Friday, Michigan men’s 
basketball coach John Beilein 
said earning minutes at the ‘5’ 
spot would be “very competitive.” 
He never said it would be a blood 
battle.

But that didn’t stop freshman 

forward Moritz Wagner from 
stiffening his 6-foot-10 frame and 
setting his feet to take a charge 
midway through the second half 
of the Wolverines’ win against 
Elon on Monday. When he stood 
up, blood dripped down from a 
gash in his forehead. He slapped 
his chest twice and returned to 
the bench to wipe away the blood.

Wagner was one of four big 

men whom Beilein rotated in 
during the Wolverines’ 88-68 win 
over the Phoenix. In each half, the 
situation down low looked more 
or less like this: Junior forward 
Mark 
Donnal 
started, 
then 

redshirt freshman D.J. Wilson 
and sophomore Ricky Doyle 
subbed in after five minutes, then 
Wagner for a few. And then, late 
in each frame, Beilein mixed it up.

After getting the start for the 

second game in a row, Donnal 
grabbed 
an 
offensive 
board 

early in the first half and put it 
back in. Two minutes later, he 
committed an off-ball foul, and 
soon after that Beilein pulled him 
and sophomore guard Kameron 
Chatman in exchange for Wilson 
and Doyle, with Doyle playing the 
‘5’ and Wilson playing as a stretch 
forward.

Wilson nailed his first 3-point 

attempt, but then, like Donnal, 
he committed a foul on the other 
end. Beilein opted to go with a 
smaller lineup and pulled Wilson. 
Then, in keeping with the theme, 
Doyle committed his first foul 
and found himself on the bench 
with Wilson taking his spot.

Wilson scored on a layup 

quickly after reentering, then 
committed 
his 
second 
foul. 

Wilson out. Wagner in.

It was a big-man merry-go-

round.

Wagner lasted less than three 

minutes in the first half, but 
his physical play was enough to 
impress Beilein. He did a nice 
job of boxing out his man on 
the defensive end and fought 
for a rebound off the offensive 
glass, forcing the ball off an Elon 
defender and giving Michigan 
possession.

Each big earned his turn on the 

floor on Monday. Donnal tallied 
15 minutes, Doyle and Wilson 
13 each and Wagner seven. But 
Beilein knows it isn’t realistic to 
play four bigs every game.

“We hope we’ll get a rotation,” 

Beilein said. “We can’t be rotating 
four guys there. Somebody’s 
gonna beat somebody out, and 
we’ll go with two or three (big 
men). Usually you need three, 
but we’ll go with two primarily 
and a third guy will back up, and 
a fourth guy will have to wait his 
turn.”

Based 
on 
minutes 
alone, 

Donnal has been Beilein’s most 
trusted manut Doyle has been 
the most productive. Doyle went 
3-for-4 from the field, including 
a big dunk. On the defensive side, 
he grabbed three boards. 

Wilson struggled against the 

Phoenix. He had twice as many 
fouls (four) as he had field goals 
(two). But in Michigan’s first 
game, he looked more poised, 
going 2-for-4 from the field and 
dishing out three assists in 23 
minutes.

The biggest wild card is still 

Wagner. 
The 
Berlin 
product 

was an option to redshirt at the 
beginning of the year, but Beilein 
opted to play him. In two games, 
he’s just 1-for-3 from the field but 
has shown an ability to step up on 
defense, which he demonstrated 
by taking a charge on Monday.

“That was awesome,” said 

redshirt 
sophomore 
Duncan 

Robinson. “He brings a ton of 
energy, to get up and pump his 
chest like that. That was a lot of 
fun. … He’s talking a lot, bringing 
a lot of energy, so he’s a great 
teammate.”

Results mixed across Big Ten

Wisconsin’s upset 
of North Dakota 

stands out, but most 
teams still mediocre

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan hockey team 

has been quite an enigma this 
season. While a 5-1-1 record 
looks great on paper, the team is 
far from satisfied.

Once again, it appears the 

12th-ranked Wolverines boast 
one of the nation’s top offenses 
— Michigan is second in the 
country with 4.43 goals per 
game — while the defense ranks 
45th out of 60 teams, allowing 
3.29 goals per game.

Regardless, the Wolverines 

are currently in the top 16 in the 
Pairwise Rankings heading into 
their 
biggest 
non-conference 

series of the year, a two-game set 
at Boston University.

Michigan aside, no other Big 

Ten team is ranked.

The Daily gives a team-

by-team breakdown of what 
the Wolverines’ five Big Ten 
counterparts have (or have not) 
accomplished in the season’s 
first five weeks:

Michigan State (4-4-1)

The Spartans have to be 

disappointed with their start to 
the season. Michigan State went 
winless in its three marquee 
games: two against Denver and 
one against Boston College.

Prior to the season, Spartans 

coach 
Tom 
Anastos 
knew 

his team would win with its 
goaltending. 
They 
returned 

the reigning Big Ten Goalie 
of the Year, Jake Hildebrand, 
who has a career .926 save 
percentage and 2.23 goals per 
game average. Through nine 
games, the netminder’s stats 
are below his career mark, but 
he still has an impressive .916 
save percentage while allowing 
2.44 goals per game.

Michigan State had a real 

chance to bump its RPI when it 

traveled to play Boston College. 
In a game that boasted arguably 
the nation’s top two goalies 
in Hildebrand and the Eagles’ 
Thatcher Demko, there were 10 
goals allowed. Boston College 
escaped with a 6-4 win.

The Spartans’ win column 

stems from a sweep of New 
Hampshire and two wins over 
Lake Superior State.

Wisconsin (3-4-1)

It’s been another wild start 

for the Badgers after they tallied 
just four wins a season ago.

Wisconsin garnered the Big 

Ten’s biggest non-conference 
win, beating No. 4 North Dakota 
on the road, 3-1. That means 
each 
Michigan-Wisconsin 

tilt is of great importance for 
the Wolverines, as a win over 
the Badgers would improve 
Michigan’s RPI.

Wisconsin coach Mike Eaves 

said after the game: “To have 
that signature win really could 
be something special for this 
group as we move forward.”

Aside from their win in Fargo, 

North Dakota, the Badgers’ only 
other wins came against Arizona 
State, which is in its first season 
as a Division I program.

Minnesota (4-5)

Minnesota lost most of its 

premier players in the offseason 
due to graduation or to the NHL. 
How the Gophers replace those 
players will define their season.

First, 
coach 
Don 
Lucia 

needed to fill the void left by 
netminder Adam Wilcox, who 
gave the Wolverines fits in the 
past. It appears he has done that 
successfully, starting freshman 
Eric Schierhorn, who has a .931 
save percentage and 2.11 goals-
allowed average.

A sluggish start to the season 

has held Minnesota back — the 
Gophers lost to Vermont and 
were 
swept 
by 
Minnesota-

Duluth to begin the year — 
but the team is starting to 
trend upward. Just recently, 
Minnesota 
stole 
one 
from 

Minnesota State on the road.

Penn State (6-2-2)

After losing Casey Bailey, 

who led the Nittany Lions in 
goals (22) and points (40) last 
season, to the Toronto Maple 
Leafs, Penn State’s offense had 
multiple question marks.

However, the Nittany Lions 

haven’t skipped a beat. They 
boast the nation’s third-best 
offense, scoring 4.40 goals per 
game. Freshman forward Chase 
Berger is leading that charge, 
already having tallied eight 
goals.

Penn State has been aided by a 

porous non-conference schedule, 
with its best win coming over 
Notre Dame at home.

Ohio State (3-7)

The Buckeyes had an ultra-

slow start to the season, losing 
their first seven games. Ohio 
State was swept by both Miami 
(Ohio) and Providence — its 
toughest 
non-conference 

opponents.

Forward Nick Schilkey has 

come out of the gates firing, 
registering six goals and six 
assists, and the junior has been 
a large reason for the Buckeyes’ 
current 
three-game 
winning 

streak.

Still, it’s looking like it could 

be a long season for the Buckeyes.

‘M’ pulls away from Elon

Walton, Robinson 

combine for 43 
points to power 
another home win

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

Duncan Robinson sank a 3 

from the corner. Then he did it 
again. And again. By the end of 
the 
first 

half, 
the 

redshirt 
sophomore 
was 4-for-4 from the field.

Robinson and junior guard 

Derrick Walton Jr. combined 
for 43 points Monday in the No. 
24 Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s win over Elon, with 33 
of those coming on 3-pointers. 
The offense shot 51.7 percent, 
and though it looked explosive 
at some times, it looked sloppy at 
others. 

But the Wolverines didn’t have 

trouble dropping the Phoenix, 
88-68, in a Battle 4 Atlantis 
Mainland 
Game 
just 
three 

days after defeating Northern 
Michigan. 

Though Elon didn’t provide a 

true test of his team’s talent, the 
game gave Michigan coach John 
Beilein more time to work out his 
starting lineup. 

On 
the 
first 
possession, 

sophomore forward Kameron 
Chatman threw the ball to an 
open Derrick Walton Jr. as the 
shot clock dwindled to four 
seconds. 
The 
junior 
guard 

threw it up from beyond the 
arc without hesitation, and the 
student section erupted as the 
Wolverines won an early lead 28 
seconds into the game.

“(Walton) 
played 
great,” 

Robinson said. “That’s a big thing 
for him, just staying aggressive. 
That’s when he plays his best. He 
was finding people all over the 
floor and was really efficient at 
scoring the ball as well.”

But 
minutes 
later, 
the 

Wolverines went on a six-minute 
scoring drought to allow Elon to 
tie it up at 12, only to snap out 
of it by hitting their next three 
attempts. 

Redshirt 
freshman 
D.J. 

Wilson ended the drought with 
a tip-in, and then, seconds later, 
Robinson scored his first points 
as a Wolverine with a dunk to 
get Michigan to a 16-15 lead. 
Robinson 
got the ball 
again 
after 

picking off an 
inbounds pass 
and fed it to 
sophomore 
guard 
Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman, 
who took it 
the length of 
the court for a layup. 

There 
were 
still 
clumsy 

moments, though. Four minutes 
into the game, sophomore guard 
Aubrey Dawkins let the ball slip 
through his fingers and go out 
of bounds after LeVert threw it 
to him from half-court. LeVert 

was burned by Phoenix guard 
Steven Santa Ana, who stole 
the ball and drove it to the net 
for a layup. Elsewhere, junior 
big man Mark Donnal missed 
multiple shots from under the 
basket. Junior forward Zak Irvin 
played his first minutes since his 
early-September back surgery 
and went 0-for-5 from the floor. 
Michigan entered halftime with 
just a 10-point lead. 

“The 
funny 

thing about Zak 
is that one shot 
doesn’t 
phase 

him, so until he 
gets his rhythm 
back, you can 
expect him to 
get 
‘em 
up,” 

Walton 
said. 

“So we know 
we can expect 
him to make 

the right play, but until then, 
we’re trying to get him back to a 
rhythm to find his niche and get 
his condition back.”

The Wolverines came out of 

the locker room on a 10-0 run by 
correcting some of those mistakes 
and continuing what they had 

been doing well. Walton and 
Robinson had more 3-pointers, 
and LeVert had two monster 
dunks. Forward Ricky Doyle 
came in and outplayed Donnal by 
making all three of his second-half 
shots and looking more composed 
on the defensive end. 

“(Elon) played a really, really 

fast pace,” Robinson said. “From 
that standpoint, we definitely 
have a lot of room to grow 
defensively, just being a little bit 
closer in communication, but it 
was definitely a step in the right 
direction.”

In a high-scoring game where 

Walton led with 24 points, 
seven assists and six rebounds, 
Beilein took full advantage of his 
team’s depth. Against Northern 
Michigan, Dawkins and LeVert 
led the charge, but against Elon, 
it was Walton and Robinson.

“I mean, any night it could 

be anyone else, which is a great 
quality to have in a team,” 
Robinson said. “We all know 
that. 
Last 
Friday, 
everyone 

was excited for those two, and 
tonight, everyone’s excited for us. 
It’s whoever can get it done on a 
given night.”
