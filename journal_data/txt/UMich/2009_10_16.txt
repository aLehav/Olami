'U' endowment falls 21 percent

Big drop on par with that
of other endowments
across the country
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
The University's endowment fell 21 per-
cent last year, a significant drop but one
on par with endowments of other schools
around the country.
The endowment's value now stands at
approximately $1.6 billion, University offi-
cials reported yesterday.
Reporting at the University's Board of
Regents monthly meeting, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer Tim-
othy Slottow presented the regents with
the annual report on investments. The
endowment, which was valued at $7.6 bil-
lion in June 2008 fell to $6 billion in June
2009, Slottow said.
The report presented to the regents yes-
terday showed that only one area of the
University's investments saw a positive
return last year - a 4.6-percent increase in
fixed income.

All other categories - equities, absolute
return, venture capital, private equity, real
estate and energy - posted double-digit
percentage losses. Among the largestwas a
38.5-percent drop in real estate assets and
a 30.5-percent decline in energy invest-
ments.
In a committee meeting before the
regents meeting, Slottow and Chief Invest-
ment Officer Erik Lundberg reported the
news to the regents and discussed how
the University would be affected by the
decline.
Reading a statement during the regents
meetingyesterday, RegentKatherine White
(D-Ann Arbor) said although the drop is
significant, the University is in a much bet-
ter spot than many other schools.
Many other institutions have lost larger
sharesoftheirendowments, includingHar-
vard University, which lost 27 percent of its
endowment, and Yale University, which
lost 30 percent over the lastyear.
However, some institutions lost less than
the University of Michigan, including the
University of Virginia, which saw a 21-per-
cent drop in its endowment.
"Even though the banking crisis in the
short term created a challenging year ...

over the past 10 years, the University's
endowment has earned an annualized
return of 9 percent," White said.
White said the overall increase is evi-
dence that the University's long-term
approach to investing is paying off.
"Although these numbers showa signifi-
cant decline in one year, the endowment
is invested for the long term," White said.
"The overall performance of the portfolio
is consistent with our diversified strategy
to provide an ample amount of return to
support operations at the University, while
protecting the corpus and fostering the
endowment's growth."
At the end of her statement, White rec-
ognized Lundberg and thanked him for his
oversight of the University's investments.
In a letter presented to the regents, Slot-
tow and Lundberg wrote that the unex-
pected spikes and drops in the market are
normal.
"While a negative 23-percent return for
the endowment was always possible, it was
about as unlikely to occur as the positive
44-percent return generated in the first
year of the Investment Office's operation,"
the two wrote. "These widely different

A HISTORIC DECLINE
For only the second time in the past two decades, the University's
endowment lost value over the previous fiscal year.

REGENTS NOTEBOOK
'U'looks at
ownership
of disputed
remains
At busy meeting, regents also
get update about the state of
H1N1on campus and approve
honorary degrees
ByKYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
Speaking at the University's Board of Regents
monthly meeting yesterday, Stephen Forrest, vice
president for research, announced a
new committee had been formed to NOTEBOOK
explore how the University handles
culturally unidentifiable human remains.
The Advisory Committee on Culturally Unidenti-
fiable Human Remains, which consists of 10 faculty
members and one graduate student, will advise For-
rest on how to handle requests from Native Ameri-
can tribes for the transfer of culturally unidentifiable
human remains currently being housed in the Univer-
sity's Museum of Anthropology.
The University has come under fire in the past for
refusing to release remains, which Native American
tribes have claimed are rightfully theirs. The Univer-
sity has maintained that the remains are not identi-
fiable and that under the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act the University is
required to maintain possession of the remains until
final regulations are released or the Secretary of the
Interior explicitly directs the release of the remains.
New regulations are expected to loosen restrictions
and to dictate how the University and other organi-
zations should distribute culturally unidentifiable
human remains.
Though no new rules have been handed down yet,
Forrest said he hopes that the University will "do the
right thing, be proactive and be prepared for antici-
pated changes in federal rules."
Prof. Phil Deloria, a member of the new committee,
said he looks forward to serving on the committee.
"It's something that's concerned a lot of native
students and lot of native faculty on campus, myself
included," Deloria said. "My sense is that what this
committee will do is look at these from a critical intel-
lectual, ethical sense of positions and try to offer
advice."
However, Fred Harrington, a former member of
the Lake Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians tribal
council, said he doesn't see a need for the committee.
"I don't understand what possible good a commit-
tee can do," he said. "I don't understand how (the
University) can continue to hold the remains of tribal
ancestors in their museum unless they've followed
the law, so I'm not sure what they're doing with the
committee."

Ever pay your cabbie with a bur-

Didn't think so.
But if you took a pedicab, you prob-

will gladly take your burritos.
Schemanski and Grand Valley
State University sophomore Josh
Lycka opened Petoskey Pedicab, LLC
this summer in their hometown of
Petoskey, Mich. And in the fall, Sche-

manski brought the business back to
school with him.
"People think it's really cool and
respect the fact that we bike around
to make a living," Schemanski said.
The carriages sit on two wheels
and are pulled through the street by
a man-powered bicycle.
Hundreds of cities across the coun-
try currently have pedicab services,
including New York, Chicago and San
Francisco.
Last winter, Schemanski and
Lycka were trying to come up with
something they could do during the
summer to make some money.
"We were both working in a kitch-

about different things we could do

Document sets student
rights, campus group
rules, funding framework
By MALLORY JONES
Daily StaffReporter
The Michigan Student Assembly will
launch a constitutional convention in
the next few weeks to revise the Univer-
sity student constitution - all in hopes
of bringing legitimacy back to a docu-
ment that many students on campus
don't even know exists.
MSA student General Counsel Jim
Brusstar, who also serves as secretary
of the convention, said the student con-
stitution - which was written in 1986 -
needs some major revising.
"It's very broken up," he said. "It
doesn't have the kind of logical flow
that it should. It's not very clear about
some things. There are some parts that

are even contradictory. I mean there are
even some spelling errors."
ThoughBrusstarhasadetailedknowl-
edge of the constitution and knows what
he would like to see changed, he said
discretion will ultimately be left up to
the students involved in the convention.
"We wanted to involve people who
might not otherwise be involved," he
said. "Ultimately everyone does have a
stake in this."
The student constitution outlines the
structure of all student governments,
establishes the rights of student groups
and students and states the way in which
these groups interact, said Brusstar.
The constitutional convention will
have the chance to revise any of these
structures, from the large-scale ques-
tions like the purpose of student gov-
ernment to more practical questions
like how MSA distributes funds to stu-
dent organizations.
MSA officials hope to make the docu-

Kansas legislator's 'Red Neck Rap'
video taken down from YouTube

Videoby Republican
BillkOtto criticizes
PresidentObama
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - A video
featuring a Kansas legislator criti-
cizing President Barack Obama's
policies while wearing a hat
describing opossum as "the other
dark meat" was removed yesterday
from YouTube, where the lawmak-
er had posted it last month.
Republican Rep. Bill Otto said
he didn't remove the video, titled
"RedNeck Rap," and didn't know
whyithadbeentakendown. Google
Inc., YouTube's owner, could offer
no explanation.
Otto said criticism of the video
was unfounded. He said the hat's
saying, which he repeats at the end
of the short video, refers to redneck
stereotypes, not Obama.
The White House declined to
comment yesterday, but Kansas
Senate Minority Leader Anthony
Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, called

the video "disturbing." He said it's
logical to see the reference as being
to the first black president's race.
In the video, Otto pauses after
criticizing Obama and his policies,
repeats the saying on the cap and
adds, "A little greasy, but hey."
"It's a reference to rednecks,"
Otto said during a telephone inter-
view from his home in LeRoy, a
small town about 75 miles south of
Topeka. "It's like 'The Beverly Hill-
billies,'eating opossumbellies, grits
and pigs' feet."
The flap comes less than two
months after U.S. Rep. Lynn Jen-
kins, another Kansas Republican,
remarked in a public forum that
the GOP was still looking for "a
great white hope." She later said
she wasn't referring to Obama and
didn'tknowofthe phrase'spastlink
to pre-civil-rights era racism.
Attempts by AP to access Otto's
video Thursday night resulted in
a message stating that it had been
"removed by the user." Google
spokesman Scott Rubin said if a
video is removed for violating You-

Tube's standards, a message would
say so.
"With 20 hours of video upload-
ed every minute to YouTube, we
cannot comment on individual vid-
eos," he said in an e-mail.
Meanwhile, Hensley accused
Otto of "bigotry."
"If opossum is the other dark
meat, whatis the original darkmeat
he is referring to?" Hensley said. "It
is not only thoughtless, but outra-
geous."
Otto replied:"Idon't know where
he's getting that."
Hensley, though, pointed to an
incidenthesaidhappenedearlierthis
year involving Patrick Woods, legis-
lative liaison for the Department of
Social and Rehabilitation Services.
Woods said he encountered Otto
in March while walking between
the Statehouse and an office build-
ing, and Otto said he'd confused
Woods with Rod Bremby, the state's
secretary of health and environ-
ment. Woods said Otto told him, "I
almost shot you. You look a lot like
Secretary Bremby."

HUDSONVILLE, Mich.
Woman embezzles
parents' savings
Authorities have charged a
west Michigan woman with
embezzling at least $100,000
from her parents' life savings of
$275,000.
Eloise Russo is accused of tak-
ing the money to pay for gam-
bling losses, a $10,000 gift and
a $16,000 new car for her sister.
The 53-year-old woman is free on
bond following her arraignment
Wednesday - two days after her
father, Thomas Sherwin of Hud-
sonville, died at age 90.
Russo was appointed guardian
to her father and her 83-year-old
mother, Ada, in April 2007. Otta-
wa County Probate Judge Mark
Feyen removed her from the post
in July 2008 after allegations of
fraud emerged.
" Russo's lawyer, Kelly Lambert,

client only borrowed the money
and always intended to return it.

A convicted bigamist posing

sued avenues that would never
yield them, changed his phone
number to evade his "clients"
when they started asking ques-
tions and even startled some
by proposing they marry him
in order to get legal residency,
prosecutors said.
Melendez, 60, denied the alle-
gations, which add to a series of
far-flung and colorful brushes
with the law. Records show he
was imprisoned for bigamy in
Georgia; prosecutors said he also
was convicted in an office bur-
glary in the U.S. Virgin Islands
and broke out of an Ohio jail
through a ceiling hole in 1971.

Surveillance tapes
show state senator
assaulting girlfriend
NEW YORK (AP) - A freshman
state senator was acquitted yes-
terday of smashing a glass into his
girlfriend's face, but was convict-
ed of a lesser charge for dragging
her bleeding from his apartment
in a violent scene caught on vid-
eotape.
State Sen. Hiram Monserrate,
a Queens Democrat, would have
lost his Senate seat if convicted
of second-degree felony assault.
He faces up to a year in prison at
his sentencing Dec. 4 on a mis-
demeanor count of third-degree
reckless assault for injuring Karla
Giraldo while pullingher through
a lobby as she resisted, crying and
latching on to banisters.
While a misdemeanor convic-
tion doesn't automatically force
Monserrate to vacate his Senate
seat, it opens the door for col-
leagues to consider passing a res-
olution to either censure or expel
him. That would require a 32-vote
majority following a committee
investigation. Republicans hold
30 seats and would need just two
Democrats to join them to remove
Monserrate, whose term runs
through 2010.
Monserrate, 42, said he tripped
while holding the glass, and
rushed her to a hospital. Giraldo
also said it was an accident. The
wound above her left eye required
between 20 and 40 stitches.
"A terrible accident occurred
to my girlfriend, Karla Giraldo, a
person that I love, and I have to
live with that forever. There were
nowinnershere," Monserrate said
outside court after the verdict.
The outcome of the case rested
mainly with Giraldo's testimony.
She said on the witness stand
that her language barrier (Giral-

do's native language is Spanish)
prevented her from communicat-
ing properly with the staff at Long
Island Jewish-North Shore Medi-
cal Center.
But she also dodged the pros-
ecution's questions, sometimes
answering only when the judge
ordered her to and often contra-
dicted previous statements she
made. Assistant district attorney
Scott Kessler said during closing
arguments that she wasn't cred-
ible, and she lied on the witness
stand to protect her abusive boy-
friend.
But Judge William Erlbaum,
ruling in a non-jury trial, said
Giraldo's testimony carried more
weight than that of the medical
personnel, and it had to be taken at
face value.
"There are two people who
have actual knowledge about what
happened in that apartment," Erl-
baum said. "Can one know she's
not being forgiving or that she's
not being compassionate? One
can't know that."
Prosecutors said Monserrate-
a Marine and ex-cop - smashed
Giraldo's face during an argument
at his apartment Dec. 19 sparked
by another man's card he found in
her purse.
Surveillance tape shows Mon-
serrate take the card to the trash
chute outside his apartment, wave
it at Giraldo, and toss it down.
They spent the next two hours
fighting, according to testimony
from a downstairs neighbor who
said she banged on the ceiling with
a broom to get them to quiet down.
She heard a woman crying and a
thump.
Grainy surveillance footage
later showed Giraldo making a
beeline for the neighbor's door,
as Monserrate grabbed her and
dragged her downstairs.
District attorney Richard A.
Brown, speaking after the verdict,
said the conviction justified the

complaints from some residents of
the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast
thatfederalhelp inrecoveringfrom
the 2005 disasters hasn't improved
much since he took office.
"We've got a long way to go but
we've made progress," Obama told
a town hall at the University of
New Orleans. "We're working as
hard as we can and as quickly as
we can."
As a candidate, Obama criticized
former President George W. Bush's
response to Katrina, when the gov-
ernment showed up late and unpre-
pared and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency became the
object of widespread scorn.
Thestorm killedsomet1,600peo-
ple in Louisiana and Mississippi -
and damage has been estimated at
roughly $40 billion. The damage is
still starkly visible in New Orleans
- in blighted neighborhoods of

creaky houses, boarded-up busi-
nesses, structure after structure
awaiting demolition and critical
recovery work not yet started.
Obama wanted to use his first
visit as president to the Gulf Coast
to listen to residents' concerns
about the recovery effort. And
although most questions were on
unrelated subjects, one man gave
him an earful.
"I expected as much from the
Bush administration, but why are
we still being nickeled and dimed
in our recovery?" asked Gabriel
Bordenave, 29, of New Orleans.
"I wish I could write a blank
check," Obama replied, promot-
ing Bordenave to shout back,
"Why not?"
Obama claimed progress since
he entered the White House in
January. He cited reconstruction
projects that have moved forward
after having been stalled by dis-
agreements over whether the state
or federal government would foot
the bill. FEMA is working "around
the clock to clear up red tape and to
eliminate bureaucracy on backlogs
that go back years," he said.
According to FEMA, 76 of the
120 Louisiana reconstruction proj-
ects that were stuck at the begin-

ning of his presidency have been
resolved, sending more than $1.4
billion in additional federal aid to
Louisiana.
"I know since a lot of these
problems have been going on since
Katrina, people understandably*
feel impatient," Obayna told the
crowd of, several hundred who
won tickets in an Internet lottery
to attend. "On the other hand, a lot
of these things are not going to be
fixed tomorrow."
Obama said officials from his
administration have made 35 trips
to the Gulf Coast since March -
and "notjust to make appearances,
but to listen and to learn and help
you move forward."
In his opening remarks, Obama
acknowledged residents' frustra-
tion about the pace of recovery.
As evidence, he cited firefighters
working from a trailer at a newly
reopened school in the Lower
Ninth ward that he visited earlier
Thursday.
"It's clear how far we have to go
before we can call this recovery a
success," Obama said, noting sew-
ers and roads that still need repair,
houses and hospitals that are still
vacant and schools and neighbor-
hoods still waiting to thrive.

Northern Illinois
University police
chief criticized for
gruff demeanor
CHICAGO (AP) - Atough-talk-
ing police chief hailed as a hero
for leading his men into a North-
ern Illinois University classroom
last year after a gunman opened
fire is now seen by some as a vil-
lain, of sorts, and is in danger of
losing his $199,000-a-year job.
The persona that won Donald
Grady laurels from survivors of
the Valentine's Day shooting that
left five students and the gun-
man dead is a now liability, say
a growing number of critics who
accuse Grady of being combative
and uncooperative.
Criticism of NIU's 6-foot-5 top
cop came to a head recently after
an editor of the campus newspa-
per accused Grady of threatening
and shouting at him during an
interview that became a three-
hour tirade.
"It's time to put an end to this
mess. It's time for a change,"
the Northern Star student paper
wrote in a blistering editorial
calling for Grady's removal. It
accused him of an "empirical
reign" and of employing intimi-
dation to get his way.
School officials put the
56-year-old Grady on paid leave
for 30 days starting last week
while a panel reviews the alle-
gations by editor in chief Justin
Weaver. A finding by next month
could result in Grady's dismissal,
NIU spokeswoman Kathy Buett-
ner said.
Grady responded to an e-mail
yesterday saying he couldn't dis-
cuss the matter.
But NIU police Sgt. Ramon
Holland defended his boss in a let-

ter in Wednesday's Northern Star,
praising Grady for pushingofficers
to improve their skills and to meet
the highest ethical standards.
The newspaper's main concern
was Grady's strained relations
with other area agencies, said
Weaver. The 22-year-old from
Beloit, Wis., said that threatened
to undermine overall campus
security.
"Because of that, combined
with the hostile work atmosphere
that a lot of people in the univer-
sity say he creates, we believe
we'd be better served with some-
one more willing to work with
other agencies," he said.
DeKalb County Sheriff Roger
Scott is among the officials who
have publicly backed the paper's
call for Grady's ouster or resig-
nation.
"NIU has isolated itself under
his leadership," Scott said.
The sheriff hastened to praise
Grady's immediate response to
the attack on Feb. 14, 2008.
As 911 calls came in about gun-
shots, Grady, a former sprint star,
bolted from his office and ran
the 400 yards between his office
and Cole Hall against waves of
screaming students fleeing the
complex.
Grady and several officers
rushed into the classroom. The
shooter, 27-year-old former NIU
student Steven Kazmierczak,
already was dead of a self-inflict-
ed gunshot. But survivors praised
Grady for displaying bravery
when he couldn't have known
that, and for quickly administer-
ing aid and comforting injured
students.
Grady also won kudos for bol-
stering campus security earlier
and for drawing up plans for crisis
scenarios - including a shooting
on the 25,000-student campus. For
weeks after the tragedy, students
applauded Grady when he walked

by, some even hugging him.
But his critics say that however
good Grady may be in a crisis, he's
less well-suited for the day-to-day
grind of a campus police chief.
Controversy has dogged
Grady, who also is from Beloit,
Wis., during his career. After
becoming Wisconsin's first black
police chief in the mostly white
town of Bloomer in 1989, he cre-
ated a stir by issuing nearly 300
tickets, including to himself, for
violations of a snow-shoveling
ordinance.
When he became Santa Fe,
N.M., chief in 1994, he ordered
officers to stop accepting free
cups of coffee on the job and
banned bolo ties.
Police responded with a 103-
to-5 no-confidence vote in their
boss. After digging in his heels for
two years, Grady resigned, saying
his reforms had encountered too
much resistance.
And at NIU, well before the
shooting, staff of the student
newspaper had already com-
plained that he often withheld
standard crime reports, requir-
ing the paper to file Freedom of
Information Act requests.
He has failed so far to release an
official report on the Valentine's
Day shooting. Asked earlier this
year why he hadn't done so, Grady
said he would rather not hear the
gunman's name again, that he
didn't want to give Kazmierczak
the notoriety he sought.
He also said there's no dispute
about what he deemed the most
important facts.
"You want to know who the
suspect is? You know that. He's
dead," said Grady, his stern,
booming voice rising. "You want
to know how many guns he had?
You know that. You want to know
how many victims there were?
You know that. What else do you
need to know?"

A greener blue bus
'U'in serious need of more routes to North Campus
t's regrettably true that North Campus can seem like a sep-
arate college for those who live there. And the difficulty of
traveling between North Campus and Central Campus is cer-
tainly a major factor in that feeling of isolation, as anyone who has
attempted the journey at peak hours can attest to. But with impor-
tant developments happening on North Campus, the University is
planning to look into ways of easing the strain on existing meth-
ods of transportation. The University should consider all options
to improve transportation between North Campus and Central
Campus and should aim for a greener commute.

The hassle ofhistoric housing.

In her annual State of the University
address on Oct. 5, University President Mary
Sue Coleman announced the formation of a
committee to explore transportation alter-
natives to improve intercampus connectiv-
ity. The committee, scheduled to meet in
early 2010, would consist of transportation
experts and local authorities. According to
an Oct.18 AnnArbor.com article, the commit-
tee will consider a wide array of options to
expand the University's transportation sys-
tem, including a new bus stop on Fuller Road
across from the hospital, better bicycle lanes
and a rail system. The committee wants to
address current inequities in intercampus
connectivity and insure that the transporta-
tion needs of the University population are
fully met.
For many students, North Campus may
seem like a far-off land, home only to Burs-
ley and Baits Residence Halls, freshmen and
a host of brainy engineers. But according to
the University, around 10,000 students and
faculty members live and work on North
Campus. To prevent the creation of a divid-
ed campus, it is essential to have a smooth
transportation system connecting these two
areas.Andthe currentsystem,with cramped
buses and long rides, isn't cutting it.
Improving transportation to North Cam-
pus is especially important due to develop-
ments in the last year. One of the catalysts

behind the formation of the transportation
committee was the University's purchase the
174-acre former Pfizer site, which has now
been renamed the North Campus Research
Complex. According to the Daily, about
2,000 employees are expected to inhabit the
NCRC when it opens for regular business,
definitely increasing traffic to North Cam-
pus. To compensate, more avenues for trans-
portation are clearly needed.
As the Universitylooks for ways to expand
transportation, it should keep in mind
that a well-organized mass transit system
should be environmentally friendly. For
example, both the city and the University
run buses on bio-diesel rather than conven-
tional fuels. But the University has resisted
following the city's example of switching
to hybrid buses. Although initially costly,
hybrid buses are cheaper in the long run
and better for the environment. Now could
be a prime opportunity for the University
to make this investment. Greener transpor-
tation methods are both dependable and
conscientious.
North Campus shouldn't feel like that dis-
tant step cousin you only see at Christmas.
The University needs to offer students and
employees more options for bridgingthe gap
between the two campuses, because with
the NCRC opening, the buses are only going
to get tighter.

There is a lot of drama sur-
rounding City Place, a pro-
posed apartment complex on
South Fifth Avenue,
and it's all much
ado about history.
Residents had been
trying to halt the
complex's approval,
by forming a his-
toric district in the
neighborhood. Now
that the developer
is working to pre- JAMIE
serve the history BLOCK
of the homes with
a new design, the
focus of the objec-
tions has shifted to preserving a tree,
- notably the tree on the Ann Arbor.
city seal. The old bur seems to have
found itself in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
As City Place developer Alex de
Parry told AnnArbor.com on Oct. 12,
"I hate to say a tree is driving alot of
this, but this tree is driving alot of it."
Well, sir, I hate to hear it, too.
But then again, I've really disagreed
with the residents' objections the
whole time. I'm an appreciator of the
arts (I'm a senior arts editor, after all),
and I fully acknowledge that architec-
ture is considered one of the original
fine arts, but I simply do not support
the idea of historic districts - here
or anywhere else. To halt Ann Arbor
development because we want to keep
some old houses around is absolutely
ridiculous. Population density needs
to be a key focus of the city right now,
and no amount of rustic porches is
going to solve any problems.

Low-income housing is needed
now more than ever, and we ought
to be building as many complexes as
possible to support low-income fami-
lies in Ann Arbor. To argue that the
need to preserve historic architec-
ture supersedes the need to provide
shelter is preposterous. There is no
building so beautiful or old that its
value is greater than that of preserv-
ing people's well-being.
But there's a simple supply and
demand counterargument to be made
here, too. You don't need to be an econ
major to know that people wouldn't
want to build somethingthatwouldn't
be profitable, that a service is only
profitable if people buy it and, finally,
that people usually don't buy things
they don't want. Logically deduced
from these simple points, we can
gather that buildings are built to meet
some form of popular demand. And
while there may be some demand to
have old buildings sitting around to
remind us what cities looked like back
when smallpox was still a big deal, this
seems like a paralyzing outlook when
it comes to modern expansion. There
are plenty of reasons not to want a
Wal-Mart in the middle of your small
town, but the fact that old Jeremiah
Jenkins once used to rock in that old
rocking chair in your attic shouldn't
be one of them.
But there is one argument in favor
of historic districts I have failed to
address - the artistic argument. It's
a prevalent but unfortunate trend
that all the old buildings are pretty
and all the new ones look like park-
ing lots. We have museums and other
forms of preservation for most every

other kind of art, but a museum full of
old buildings is hardly practical. The
point here is that the only remaining
viable defense for preserving these
old homes would be to consider the
phrase "historic district" as code for
"outdoor museum full of old, pretty
buildings." As I said, I'm all about the
arts, but no amount of artistic value is
worth taking up so much prime real
estate for a giant museum that most
non-residents don't even see. Call me
a dystopian, sightless fool for point-
ing this out - I'd be flattered if you
did, actually - but there's no practical
need to preserve every bit of art in this
world, no matter how big or old it may
be. If I had my way, we'd tear down all
the old historic forts and monuments
to put up homeless shelters.
Expansion should
trump old buildings
every time.
Historic districts, especially in a
time of economic recession with a
need for low-income housing, serve
no pragmatic purpose. If you want to
value aesthetics over advancement,
be my guest. But now is not the time
to get bogged down in buildings of
bygone times.

Making Detroit sustainable

Detroit used to be king. It was the Silicon Val-
ley of its day - a city built on innovation and new
technology. Its only rule was to keep advancing
its industry. But Detroit broke that rule. It held
on to the automotive market for too long and
then was forced to watch as the city fell into
economic despair. Detroit's auto manufactur-
ers stopped adapting to a changing society and
foreign competition, which caused its long fall
from grace.
But I know that this isn't the end, and it's
because of Detroit's great automotive past that
the city is uniquely poised for a manufacturing
comeback. Detroit holds the needed infrastruc-
ture, workforce and space to match green indus-
try with profitability and becaame the world's
green epicenter. Detroit can become the king of
innovation and new technology once again.
Detroit is a huge city. Only a small portion
of its approximately 138 square miles is actu-
ally densely developed, and so it contains a large
amount of space. This is a trait that other large
cities don't have. So why not use this space for
something productive and economically benefi-
cial to the Detroit?
The vacant lots, instead of being ghosts of
the city's past, could be turned into commercial
farms and became products of the future. Small
urban farms and community gardens already
exist within the city, which provides examples
of urban environmentalism, but this idea needs
to be expanded to become profitable. Large
commercial farms, with an emphasis on envi-
ronmental sustainability, would grow Detroit
businesses not only locally but also across state
lines. These farms could encompass the not-so-
dense areas of Detroit and provide much needed
employment for the city.
Along with open space, Detroit contains fac-
tories; which makes the idea of bringing green
businesses to the city seemingly contradictory.
But the manufacturing infrastructure of the city
only gives it advantages. It is the most fiscally
responsible choice for green companies. Why
build a new factory when you can use an existing

one? The city not only has the infrastructure for
large-scale green manufacturing but the work-
force as well. Using the city's strong population
of factory workers and engineers, companies
can save time in the turnover from training to
producing. Imagine that famous Detroit muscle
and steel constructing massive numbers of solar
panels on the assembly line instead of cars.
The growth of a green Detroit doesn't just
stop at the city limits. It would ripple through-
out the entire state. Specifically, Ann Arbor
would undoubtedly see enormous benefits since
it's located so closely to Detroit. A green Detroit
would not only encourage job growth here, but
would present unique possibilities to the Uni-
versity for partnerships with the private sec-
tor. Such partnerships would not only aid the
University's commitment to environmental
sustainability and research, such as the goals
highlighted by University President Mary Sue
Coleman in her State of the University address,
but would also educate generations of young,
environmentally-conscious minds. A partner-
ship would also further feed the workforce of
green companies and provide close employment
to graduates.
Detroit was a city built on hard work and
innovation. And although those ideas have
partially been forgotten by the industry that
thrived on them, they can still be used to
rebuild. Detroit, because of its past, is ina prime
position to become the world's green epicenter,
which would benefit not only the city but also
the entire state through increased employment
and revenue.
Michigan's economic success is dependent on
a revitalized and profitable Detroit. Although it
may be hard to see through the lens of today's
economic recession, Detroit's green future is
not too far off. It can once again lead in advanc-
ing industry and innovation. Detroit was once
king, and I say it's time for the city to reclaim
its crown.

'Tame 'Wild Things'

* Though visually stunning,
'Where the Wild Things
Are' can't reproduce the
magic of the book
By JENNIFER XU
Daily Arts Writer
At this point, you have probably seen the
"Where the Wild Things Are"
trailer taking up every other
commercial spot on TV, blar-
ing an earnest rendition of the WIhere
Arcade Fire's "Wake Up." You ffmWfd
have probably looked through
the windows of Urban Outfit- ThingS Are
ters, which peddles the film's At Quality 16
characteristic stuffed ani- and Showcase
mals, T-shirts and leggings -
maybe you have even bought Warner Bros.
yourself a shirt or two. The
"Wild Things" franchise has literally turned
into a hipster's nirvana, and most people haven't
even seen the movie yet. But let this review be a
warning: Don't expect too much, because you
will inevitably be disappointed.
Director Spike Jonze ("Being John Mal-
kovich") and co-screenwriter Dave Eggers
("Away We Go") have adapted Maurice Send-
ak's timeless children's picture book "Where
the Wild Things Are" into a full-length film,
extendinglo lines of plot into 94 minutes of cin-
ema. Max (newcomer Max Records) is a rebel-
lious kid trying to cope with the changes in his
life after his mom (Catherine Keener, "The 40
Year Old Virgin") brings her boyfriend (Mark
Ruffalo, "Zodiac") over. After being sent to his
room and biting his mom, Max angrily sails off

into the land of the Wild Things, where he sub-
sequently becomes their king.
"Where the Wild Things Are" is a film in
which things aren't wrapped up in nice, kid-
friendly boxes. The Wild Things are scary.
These huge-headed creatures do horrific things
like destroy trees, push whole boulders off cliffs
and eat the humans they don't like. But simul-
taneously, their destruction is beautiful. When
Carol, a Wild Thing voiced neurotically by
James Gandolfini (TV's "The Sopranos"), bal-
letically body slams his friends and annihilates
their nests, it's frightening, but also magical.
Directors often tend to romanticize childhood
as a time of painless bliss. "Wild Things," on
the other hand, is a perfect encapsulation of a
child's monstrous capabilities without appear-
ing too threatening.
The dialogue is delivered strictly in"kid speak"
- it's doubtful that any word in the screenplay
exceeds two syllables. In this way, Jonze stays
faithfully true to akid's world. Max is a kid act-
ing like a kid, akid who can't completely express
his thoughts in understandable sentences. While
this is at first charming, viewers will eventually
find themselves in a world they don't completely
understand. If the emotions evoked from the film
can't be described inwords,they need tobe made
up in some other kind of intangibility, and in that
regard, Jonze fails to deliver. When the Wild
Things pile up in a huge sleeping heap, it's cute
and everything, but there's also an overwhelm-
ing feeling of alienation. It's like Jonze tries so
badly to capture the spirit of childhood that he
doesn't consider that maybe the adults watching
can't keep up.
It's difficult to sift through the feelings
evoked from this movie at first because it looks
so damngorgeous. The casting is as close to per-
fect as it can get. Max's face could have been cut
out of a Renaissance painting. Sunlight liber-

ally bathes each camera shot, and it's as if some
minimalist Japanese designer dreamed up the
scenes where Carol and Max tread through a
land inundated with sand. In the film's sound-
track, Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs tenderly
vocalizes through conflict and resolution alike.
If emotions could be told purely through visu-
als and hipster music, Jonze has literally made
the most perfect film of the year. But while this
might well be the mostbeautiful movie of 2009,
it's also the most underwhelming.
The thing is, there is no way Jonze could
have executed the movie any better. The visu-
als stay true to Sendak's haunting, soulful
drawings - even adding a layer of depth to
them. It is undeniable that Jonze has captured
the voice of the book perfectly; however, that is
not enough to translate into a working movie.
Whereas the book focuses on one beautifully
illustrated scene, Jonze tries to turn that scene
into a long parable on life. Somehow it just
doesn't ring true.
This conundrum leads to a larger question:
If something like this doesn't completely gel
with adults, will kids be more forgiving of, or
even feel, the film's emotional disconnect? The
viewer is expected to see the world through
Max's lens, and, for some, this may prove near-
ly impossible. Yet this is a film that necessi-
tates the absence of adult bias in order to truly
appreciate its subtleties. Perhaps Jonze made
a film targeted exclusively toward kids and
adults who act like kids, a kind of Rorschach
test that only the few sincerely connected to
their childhood could pass.
"Where the Wild Things Are" isn't a disaster
- there are some scenes that are truly sublime.
But a movie like this, for all its lush, slightly
unorthodox visuals and standoffish childlike
simplicity, builds itself up to be brilliant. And
it's just not brilliant.

Baucus: Democrats will
vote for health reform plan

During the Great
Depression, life
0 expectancy jumped
from 57 to 63 years
By OLIVIA CARRINO
Daily StaffReporter
A new University study shows
that although the current eco-
nomic downturn may be hurting
your income, it may also be help-
ing your health.
According to a University study
published in the current issue of
the Proceedings of the National
Academy ofScience, life expectan-
cy increased by six or seven years
duringtheGreatDepression,while
deaths from disease, accidents and
infant mortality decreased.
Researchers JosTapiaGrana-
dos and Ana Diez Roux from the
University's Institute for Social
Research used historical life
expectancy and mortality data to
analyze the relationship between
economic growth and population
health from 1920 to 1940.
They found that the life expec-
tancy of men and women, both
white and non-white, increased
from 57 to 63 years between 1929
and 1932.
Mortality tended to peak dur-
ing times of strong economic
expansion, but declined dur-
ing times of economic recession
when there were even gains in
life expectancy.
Of course, suicide mortal-
ity, which increased during the
Great Depression, was the only
exception.
Tapia Granados said he believes
that general health tends to evolve
more during periods in which the
economy is weakened, while peri-
,ds of economic expansion are not
good for population health.
'I think that the study quite
clearly shows that the ideas that
economic recession are bad for
society in all aspects are quite
wrong," he said. "In this case it is
quite clear that the Great Depres-

H1NI ON CAMPUS
Also during the meeting yes-
terday, the regents received an
update on the state of the HINI flu
at the University.
According to a presentation
by Dr. Robert Ernst, the medi-
cal director of University Health
Service clinic operations, told the
regents that the extensive coordi-
nation between University Health
Service, the University's Health
System, the office of the Provost
and the Division ofStudent Affairs
are key to controlling a possible
outbreak on campus.
Ernst said currently the Uni-
versity Hospital sees between five
and 10 patients with HIN1 each
day, down from early September
when as many as 50 cases were
visiting the hospital each day.
Ernst explained that while the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention have classified most
states as having a widespread out-
break of H1N1, Michigan is one of
only a few states not to have been
classified in that category.

While Ernst explained this,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman - a biochemist who has
served onthe board of the Institute
of Medicine - said, "It's just a mat-
ter of time," referring to the fact
that most believe every state will
be classified as having widespread
cases of HINT in the near future.
On a positive note, Ernst said
the University of Michigan Health
System received its first shipment
of HiN1 vaccinations this week
and that it would begin giving
them to staff next week.
Because ofthe limited availabil-
ity of vaccinations, health workers
and people at high risk will receive
vaccinations first, Ernst said.
In an interview after the meet-
ing, Coleman said she was con-

sion, in the aspect of population
health, was not at all harmful."
During the economic expan-
sion period known as the Roar-
ing Twenties, population health
stagnated and there was no prog-
ress in U.S. health as a whole,
Tapia Granados said. However,
during the economic recession of
the 1930s, the general trend was
an increase in longevity.
Although the study did notana-
lyze potential causes for the pat-
tern, including possible advances
in technology and health care, the
researchers offer some explana-
tions about the trend.
Among other theories, during
recessions, there is less work to
do, more time to sleep and less
money is spent on alcohol and
tobacco because people do not
have the means.
Tapia Granados included that
a wrong interpretation of this
study is thatbeing unemployed is
good for one's health.
"The paper is looking at the
whole population and cannot
differentiate what was happen-
ing to people who had jobs and
those who did not have jobs,"
he explained. "To be jobless, to
be unemployed, is not good for
health. Even though in periods of
recession more people are unem-
ployed, at the population level,
at the general level, the health of
the people tend to improve."
Tapia Granados said the
study's findings may also be
applicable to the current eco-
nomic downturn.
"Is this relevant for present
conditions? Well I think so," he
said.
"Not because you can extrapo-
late what happened 70 years ago
or 80 years ago to the present, but
because there have been other
studies in which effects of reces-
sions and expansions of health
have been looked at," he contin-
ued. "They have been looked at in
quite more recent periods, in the
1980s and 1990s, and the results
of these studies are quite con-
sistent with results for the Great
Depression."
fident about the plan's ability to
deal with HN at the University.
"I feel really good about our
preparation," Coleman said. "Who
knows, we might get a big wave,
but I think we're prepared for it."
REGENTS APPROVE
HONORARY DEGREES
By a unanimous vote, the
University's Board of Regents
approved four honorary degrees
to be awarded at winter com-
mencement during its monthly
meeting yesterday.
Jeff Daniels, a well-known
actor, songwriter and playwright,
will deliver the keynote address
at winter commencement. During
the ceremony, University officials
will honor him with an honorary
Doctor of Fine Arts.
Though not speaking at com-
mencement, long-time White
House Correspondent Helen
Thomas will also attend win-
ter commencement and will be
awarded an honorary Doctor of
Humane Letters.
Grace Lee Boggs, an advocate
for civil rights, labor issues and
justice, will also accept an hon-
orary Doctor of Humane Letters
while in attendance at the winter

commencement ceremonies.
Edward Wilson, who spoke at
the opening of the University's
Life Science Institute in 2004,
will return to campus for winter
commencement. While in atten-
dance, Wilson - a widely-known
entomologist - will be awarded
an honorary Doctor of Science
degree.
None of the four individuals are
alumni of the University, but Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man said they were selected to
receive honorary degrees because
of their ties to Michigan and lead-
ership in their fields.

Senate Finance chair
said lawmakers have
a moral obligation to
reach an agreement
WASHINGTON (AP) - When it
comes time to vote, every Demo-
crat in the Senate - and perhaps
more than one Republican - will
support legislation overhauling
the nation's health care system, the
chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee predicted Thursday.
That assertion by Sen. Max Bau-
cus,D-Mont.,was anotable show of
confidence coming in the midst of
negotiations with Majority Leader
Harry Reid and White House offi-
cials to finalize legislation that can
satisfy liberal Democrats without
alienating moderates - and get
the 60 votes needed to advance in
the 100-seat Senate.
Baucus told reporters that law-
makers have a moral obligation to

repair the health care system to
rein in costs and extend coverage
to millions of the uninsured.
"And that is why we are goingto
pass health care reform legislation
this year, and it is why every Dem-
ocrat will vote for it, and it is why
there will be at least one Republi-
can and maybe a couple more who
also will vote for it," Baucus said.
"Every Democrat will vote for
national health care reform," Bau-
cus emphasized.
Democrats control 60 Senate
votes, but that includes two inde-
pendents, and leaders have been
uncertain of support from a num-
ber of moderates who've expressed
concerns about the price tag of
health care legislation and the gov-
ernment's role in a remade system.
Baucus' prediction followed
approval by his committee ear-
lier this week of a tO-year, $829
billion bill that makes numerous
changes to the health care system
alongthe lines sought by President
Barack Obama, but taking a more

centrist approach than the other
four health care bills approved by
House and Senate committees.
Baucus and Reid met Thursday
with White House Chief of Staff
Rahm Emanuel and other officials
wrestlingto merge the Finance bill
with a more liberal version passed
by the Senate Health, Education,
Labor and Pensions Committee.
Reid later held out hope of get-
ting support from more Repub-
licans than just Sen. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine, who was the
lone GOP "yes" vote in the Finance
Committee.
Unanswered is whether Reid
will include provisions in the bill
to allow the government to sell
insurance in competition with
private industry. That so-called
public plan is supported by liber-
als, who spoke up in favor of it at
a closed-door Senate Democratic
caucus meeting Thursday.
But because of opposition from
moderate Senate Democrats, any
public plan Reid does include

likely would be some type of com-
promise, such as leaving the deci-
sion on a public plan to states or
offering public coverage only as a
backstop in areas where one insur-
er has a lock on the market - the
approach favored by Snowe.
Reid said, "We're going to work
very hard ... to see what, if any-
thing, we're going to do" on a gov-
ernment plan.
"I favor a public option. Every-
one knows that," Reid added.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif., mounted a strong defense
of a public plan at a news confer-
ence, contending that recent
attacks from the health insurance
industry should dispel any doubts
about the need for it.
"Our House bill will have a pub-
lic option," Pelosi declared.
She referred to an industry-
funded study that said insurance
premiums would rise under the
Senate Finance bill, and also ref-
erenced an insurance industry ad
campaign targeted at seniors.


PEDICABS
From Page1A
tion in New York City that limited
the number of pedicabs allowed on
the streets, Schemanski and Lycka
said they were able to purchase two
cabs at a cheap price. Schemanski
said this made the opportunity too
good to pass up.
They started the business last
summer in their hometown of Peto-
skey, Mich., giving tours of the city
during the afternoons and running
as a regular taxi service for the local
bars during the night.
In the fall, Schemanski brought
the business to Ann Arbor, where
the pedicabs were first used during
welcome week.
"At first there were a lot of double
takes," he said. "We started talking
to people about it and alot of people
didn't know what it was. But once
one person rode it, and people saw
it, they joined in too."
For rides under 10 minutes, the
drivers only ask for a tip. But if
the ride is longer than 10 minutes,
they'll give you a quote, typically $3
to $5 per person, per mile.
"Some people questionthe decision
to go by tips," Schemanski said. "But
it has proven itself to work very well.
I would say that I get overpaid much
more frequently than underpaid."
Music School senior Fritz McGirr,
who sometimes drives the pedicabs,
was even tipped with a burrito once
after he transported the co-owner
of Burrito Jointtowork.
"It made my day," he said.
The pedicabs run from 10 p.m. to
3 a.m., Friday through Sunday, and
Schemanski said it is rare for a driver

Calvin Schemanski poses for a photo with the pedicabs he recently purchased to start his transportation business.

to go 10 minutes without giving a ride.
"Most people walk because call-
ing a (regular) taxi for a 10- or
15-minute walk seems silly;" he said:
"But when a guy with a bike andcar-
riage rolls by asking only for a tip to
ride you to your destination, many
people recognize the value and take
advantage of our service."
Engineering freshman Joe Beck,
who is a regular pedicab customer,
said the quality of the service is one
reason he continues to come back.
"Calvin told me he'd take me
down the street for a dollar," Beck
said. "After that, I kept seeing him
and Ikept gettingrides."
Beck is just one of the many regu-
lar customers the new service has
drawn, but once winter comes, they

might have to resort to regular taxis
to transport them around town.
"We pride ourselves on doing our
best to provide an enjoyable ride,"
Schemanski said. "When the tem-
perature is so cold it is hard to offer
that quality experience."
Petoskey Pedicab, LLC will close
for the winter but not permanently.
Depending on the weather, the com-
pany might open occasionally.
Schemanski said the two plan
to return to Petoskey next summer
where they will continue to offer
tours. And, because of their success
in Ann Arbor, they plan to come
back again next fall.
"This was our experimental year.
It didn't costus much.We found alot
of demand for it," Schemanski said.

"We didn't have any problems with
the government or police so we're
buying another pedicab or two and
continuing it next year."
Despite the positive feedback for
the new company;there are some in
Ann Arbor who aren't as excited.
Kevin Tulppo, a dispatcher for
Amazing Blue Taxi, LLC, voiced his
skepticism of the new business.
Tulppo said it was taking away
some of his business, but he didn't
see how the company could last in
the winter months.
"It's a nice novelty, but I don't see
howpeoplecanmakealivingoffofit,"
Tulpposaid. "Theonlytime(pedicabs
can) make moneyisthe first couple of
months of autumn and then the few
weeksbefore graduation."

ment more relevant to students by
inviting them to take part in the
revision process. Students can apply
to be a part of the convention on
MSA's website starting early next
week. From those applications,
MSA President Abhishek Mahanti,
will select about 40 delegates to
serve at the convention.
MSA representatives will hold
about a quarter of the spots at the
convention.
Mahanti said revising the stu-
dent constitution has the potential
to improve the way students inter-
act with each other and with their
student government.
"The all-campus constitution
governs the way that all the student
entities on campus work, whether
it's student government or student
organizations," Mahanti said. "By
re-writing that, we can get student
orgs to work together in a new, pos-
itive way."
Michael Rorro, MSA vice presi-
dent, will chair the constitutional
convention. He said it will re-exam-
ine how MSA serves student groups
on campus.
"The entire structure of how we

universities, since most schools use
three- or five-year averaging sys-
tems.
In an interview after the meet-
ing, University President Mary Sue
Coleman said she's proud of the
University's long-term investment
strategy.
"They arelong-term thinkers and
that has served us extraordinarily
well," Coleman said of Lundberg
and the Investment Office. "None
of us know what the markets are
going to do, but I have great faith in
(Lundberg's) team."
Despite her confidence, Coleman
said additional cuts to University
function is really coming into light
and coming into question," Rorro
said.
After the convention comes up
with a revised document, they will
vote to put the document on the bal-
lot and then the student body will
vote on it during the March MSA
elections, Mahanti said.
Three fifths of the voting student
body needs to approve the docu-
ment for it to be enacted.
Rorro said he hopes the con-
vention will be able to approve the
document by the end of January to
allow for two months of promotion
on campus before the vote.
In the process of rallying appli-
cants, the leaders of this convention
have the added burden of proving
the relevance of the constitution to
the studentbody.
Rorro said the topics that are
most important to students are
funding for student groups, the
Central Student Judiciary and the
power that MSA has to amend the
Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities.
"Every single funding source
from student fees for student orgs is
governed by this document," Rorro
said.
The students on the convention
will have the power to change how

spending would be needed to offset
expected cuts in state funding.
"We'll be tightening our belts,"
she said. "We've already said we've
got to cut this year, but our goal is
to protect the experience students
have and always make that better."
Regent Denise Ilitch (D-Bing-
ham Farms) said in an interview
after the meeting that she recog-
nizes the University will likely face
hardships in the coming years.
"I think it's too early to tell but
I am concerned that we're going to
have a difficult year next year over-
all," Ilitch said. "I think we will
be impacted - to what degree, it's
hard to say."
money is distributed and even what
percentage of the MSA's income will
be given to student groups.
In addition to amending the
funding structure, delegates to
the convention can also amend the
organization of the student judicial
court. CSJ has the power to solve
disputes between student organi-
zations, within student organiza-
tions and students can file a CSJ
suit against MSA.
In the current constitution, there
are no specifics as to who can serve
as a justice on CSJ, which allows for
the possibility of corruption. While
this hasn't come up yet, the current
constitution, for example, does not
prevent the MSA president from sit-
ting as a justice.
"I mean there's not that many
cases through CSJ, but if we clean
up the process and let people know
about it, there might be a couple
hundred CSJ cases a year," Rorro
said. "Which means that MSA is
putting people on this body and
that's actually a really important
thing."
The constitution also gives MSA
the power to amend the Statement of
Student Rights and Responsibilities,
which students agree to when they
apply to the University, Rorro said.

However, Ilitch said she is proud
that the University has been able
to outperform many other institu-
tions.
"I'm pleased with the perfor-
mance," Ilitch said. "I think we've
done much better than some of our
peers."
Despite the hit to the Universi-
ty's financial backbone, University
officials expect the overall invest-
ment payout to increase in the com-
ing year, because of the University's

cers of the University, and Senate
Advisory Committee on University
Affairs, the leading faculty govern-
ing body - has the power to amend
the statement.
This year, MSA will consider pro-
posing seven amendments to the
Statement. There have been no pro-
posals from University executives
or SACUA, Rorro said.
By taking the power out of the
hands of the assembly, Rorro hopes
that the politics involved in MSA
that have made large-scale change
difficult in the past will not get in
the way at the convention.
Rorro cited last year's effort to get
rid of political parties, which failed
because MSA representatives were
each sponsored by a party.
Along with the major changes
that this convention could make
to the constitution, Rorro said that
this process has the potential to
unite student organizations.
"This could, as aside effect, could
really bring campus together,"
Rorro said.
He added that the creation of the
convention shows MSA's commit-
ment to change.
"We languished control of our
organization," Rorro said. "This
assembly had ahuge amount of faith
with the student body."

'M' treats No. 1
Penn State like
any other team

Sophomore Kim Siebert played a big role in Michigan's stalwart man-to-man defense against the high-octane Boilermaker offense.
Wolverines extend 12-day scoreless
drought, fall to tough Purdue squad

By MARK BURNS
DailySports Writer
Take a 20-piece puzzle. Now try
and take one of those pieces and
put it into the correct position -
but then you find out that for some
reason, the piece doesn't fit.
The Michigan volleyball team
faces No. 1 Penn State - that awk-
ward piece that just won't fit -
tonight inside an already sold-out
Cliff Keen Arena. The Wolverines
(4-2 Big Ten, 16-3 overall) haven't
defeated the Nittany Lions since
Nov. 2, 2002.
Since then, Penn State has won
two national championships, in
2007 and 2008.
But instead of looking at
tonight's match as an anomaly,
the Wolverines are looking at the
match as just another step in hope-
fully completing their quest for a
Big Ten Championship.
"It's important to know that
they're No. 1, but it's also impor-
tant to know that rankings don't
matter," senior libero Megan
Bower said.
Bower, along with the rest of the
team, isn't treating this game like
it's the end-all, be-all match of the
season. Sure, Michigan has a shot
to knock off the top-ranked team
in the country and end its seven-
year drought against the Nittany
Lions.
But last year, the Wolverines
lost convincingly in straight sets
to end the regular season.
"Sometimes when you're build-
ing cars or trying to win a volley-
ball match or studying for school,
if you think about the big picture,
it can almost become overwhelm-
ing," Michigan coach Mark Rosen
said. "If you think about the end
product, it doesn't get you any-

where. ... We really try to focus on
the process and get back to con-
centrating on the small picture
rather than the big picture.
"Because the season is so long
and because you have such high
goals and expectations, it's easy
to think about the picture and say,
'This win is so important.' And it
doesn't help you."
If the 11th-ranked Wolverines
want to disrupt Penn State's run
for a second straight undefeated
Big Ten season, Michiganwillneed
to stick to the basics. More specifi-
cally, the game will be fought with
the serve-and-pass battle.
Serving aggressively and pass-
ing with very few errors are two
trademarks of Rosen's system. If
the Wolverines win the serve-and-
pass battle, they can contend with
anyone in the Big Ten, according
to Rosen. After all, Michigan leads
the conference with 1.78 aces per
set.
Penn State, on the other hand,
leads in every other statistical
conference category - blocks,
kills, assists, hitting percentage
and opponent attack percentage.
The team is on the verge of being
labeled a legitimate collegiate
dynasty within the volleyball
community, and that has the Wol-
verines in a frenzy.
"(The team) is really excited
about the buzz surrounding this
match," Rosen said. "I'm sure in
the NBA, it's probably like when
Michael Jordan came to town
or when LeBron (James) does.
There's this buzz now that the
match is sold out. ...We've been
sold out for two days. The kids
have been getting phone calls like
crazy from friends asking if they
have any more tickets and if they
can get in."

Brown isn't the tallest player
on the team at 6-foot-2, nor does
he have the bulkiest frame (194
pounds), but the Texan's intense
and hardnosed style of play makes
him one of the hardest hitters on
the ice for the Wolverines.
And to say he's made that kind
of impression in just a few weeks
of official practices with the team
is a testament to the young for-
ward's ability to affect a game.
"He's adding physicality,"
Berenson said. "Our whole team
has to play physical, but it's a lot
easier when you're a big, strong
kid (like Brown)."
With physical senior forward
Brian Lebler playing on the third
line, Brown is able to usehis physi-
cal skill set to allow for more scor-
ing opportunities for Carl Hagelin
and Matt Rust who combined for
a total of 53 points last season.
But don't countBrown out when

it comes to scoring goals. He'll be
the first to tell you that his shot is
one of the strengths of his game.
As a member of the U.S. Nation-
al Team Development Program
Under-18 Team last year, Brown
led the squad in goals (42) and
points (74). Those numbers were
enough to attract the Phoenix
Coyotes who selected him with
the 36th overall pick in last year's
NHL Entry Draft.
And with the lack of scoring
depth behind Caporusso on the
first line, Brown's offensive prow-
ess could be essential when the
team needs someone to put points
on the board.
"He can definitely be a first liner
and I think he will be," Caporusso
said. "We're only two games in
and it's hard to tell, but I expect,
from what I've seen, for him to be
a great power forward."
Added Berenson: "The scoring
adds the finishing touch."

REACHING THE 2009 MICHIGAN FOOTBALL SCHEDULE

October 17,2009 1- Football Sat rda

Wolverines should run away with a 'W' against DSU

HALFWAY.POINT
Does this stat scare you? Michigan is 0-1 all-time
against Football Championship Subdivision competi-
tion. The one they lost just so happened to be to one of
the best FCS schools ever -- Appalachian State - but
anyway, we're done rationalizing that one.
The lowly Delaware State Hornets, winners of just
one game this season, are going to bring their best
into the Big House Saturday, because, well, this is their
Super Bowl.
You don't schedule a nonconference game over an
already-scheduled conference opponent and come
600 miles to lay down and die. Trust us, win or lose,
the Hornets will fight tough.

HIGHLIGHTS
Believe it or not, Michigan isn't the only team that
boasts maize-and-blue winged helmets that Delaware
State will play this year. Page three for details.
It's the midway point of the season (and midterm time
for Michigan students), so it's about time for The Daily
to grade the Wolverines' performance thus far.
it's best to know the enemy, right? Read about
members of the opposing team in our weekly Q&A
feature. Up this week is Hornet defensive back Avery
Grant.

Sept. 5 Western Michigan: Before this win, it had been a while since Michigan
fans had anything to cheer about during opening weekend.
Sept.12 Notre Dame: Hey, Chuck Weis, you already got schooled by one true freshman
quarterback this season. This week, you'll make it two after Matt Barkley throws all over the place.
Sept.19 Eastern Michigan: The Eagles put up a good fight in the first half, but Michigan
once agais proved there's only room for one college football team in Washtenaw County.

Sept.26 Indiana: Wait, what? Indiana still has a football team? We'll believe it when we
see it. Still haven't, even though it gave Michigan a scare for a few minutes there.
Oct. 3 at Michigan State: So the Spartans beat Michigan for the second year ina row.
Whatever. Keep Paul Bunyan. That thing is butt-ugly anyway. .

It's fall break. It's starting to
get cold. Oh, and the Wolver-
ines are playing a school you
hadn't heard of until the Athletic
Department scheduled the game
in February.
We get it - you're not exactly
excited about Saturday.
But, let's be honest, Michigan
football is still Michigan football.
Whether the Wolverines are play-
ing Ohio State or Delaware State,
you should be pumped to see the
maize-and-blue-clad players run-
ning under the "Go Blue" banner
before the game.
Obviously, the Hornets are
pretty overmatched here, but that
willgivesomeyoungWolverines a
chance to get some much-needed
experience. Players like running
back Vincent Smith, defensive
lineman William Campbell and
quarterback Denard Robinson
should be getting a lot of playing
time this week.

Want a glimpse into the future
of Michigan tailbacks? Pay atten-
tion on Saturday. The Hornets
have surrendered 202.8 rushing
yards per game so far this season.
With senior tailback Carlos Brown
questionable for Saturday with a
concussion and Brandon Minor

flashes of his speed this season,

And the 5-foot-6 Smith is more

DSU lost to
Delaware 27-17
earlier this season
By COURTNEY RATKOWIAK
Daily SportsEditor
There was something different
about those Wolverines.
On Oct. 1, 1938, Michigan beat
Michigan State 14-0 - and the
game was a sign of change.
"For Michigan, victory was as
sweet as nectar," The Michigan
Daily sportswriter Bud Benjamin
wrote. "For the first time in four
long years the sun began to peep
through the clouds. Michigan foot-
ball was on its way back -
"Why on its way back? What's
new and improved on this 1938
team?"
The lasting answer to that ques-
tion wasn't detailed in the Daily,
but we know now that what was
truly new about Michigan was
its winged helmets - now the
most lasting symbol of Wolverine

tradition.
When former Michigan player
David Nelson got the coaching job
at Delaware in 1951, he took the
helmets with him.
And this season, Delaware's in-
state "rival" Delaware State's two
biggest games of the season are
against teams that sport the tradi-
tion-rich headgear.
Delaware State's game against
Delaware, played on Sept. 19, and
the Hornets' game against Michi-
gan on Saturday were both ini-
tially intended to be just schedule
fillers. The game against Delaware
has turned into an attempt tobuild
tradition, but the game against
Michigan is a one-and-done affair.
Even though FCS (formerly
Division 1-AA) schools Delaware
and Delaware State are only locat-
ed an hour apart, they had never
scheduled a regular-season game
until one of Delaware's opponents
pulled out of its contract and the
Blue Hens needed to fill the open
date. Delaware State lost 27-17 last
month, but the two schools worked
out an agreement and will now play

Still, Rodriguez said Delaware
State and the Wolverines have
similar offenses, and he mentioned
the Hornets' speed - as well as the
Appalachian State factor of under-
estimating a FCS opponent- as
things to possibly watch out for on
Saturday.
"As a coach, you worry about
everything," he said. "You worry
about a team that has, you know,
21, 22-year-olds, which they do,
eight or nine seniors. They've got
a chip on their shoulder because
they want to prove they can play
against our guys who are 18 and
19-year-olds in some spots.
"It's not the same atmosphere
you have on a primetime Satur-
day night game we had last week.
... We'll get their Super Bowl - it's
their best shot. So our guys have to
understand that."

Six games down, six to go -
it's time to assess what's
wo ng and what
works a at.

THE ,MOST TELLING STATS



Rushing yards per game: 197.3
Get senior tailbacks Carlos Brown and
Brandon Minor healthy at the same time,
and Michigan's rushing production is more
impressive than No. 2 in the Big Ten and
No. 23 in the nation. Besides ablip when
the Wolverines put up a measly 28 yards
against Michigan State, Brown, Minor and
the other Michigan tailbacks havebeen
beyond solid.


Turnover margin: -0.33
It's a statistic that's obviously not

he. But after finishing a dismal No. 110
in the nation last year with an atrocious
-12 margin, Michigan will acceptbeing
just below zero. After center David Molk
returns from injury, expect the fumbles at
quarterback to fade.

Passing defense: 246.5
yards per game
It's lonely at the hottom. Six games in,
the Michigan defense finds itself in the
cellar of the Big Ten after givingup 2465
passing yards per game. Chalk some of
that op to talented receivers like Notre
Dame's Golden Tate and Michael Floyd, but
you can't ignore the talent void opposite
cornerbackDonovan Warren. After moving
from safety to cornerback last week against
lowa, Troy Woolfolk looks like he could be
Warren's counterpart in the backfield.

Fourth down conversions: 71%
It's still early and the sampling is small,
but the Wolverines have proven themselves
five of seven times on the down that
matters. Against Notre Dame, quarterback
Tate Forcier capitalized on decisive
play calling when he ran for a 31-yard
touchdown on a fourth down.

tackles for loss per game-
Sure, he didn't have a sack during the
first month of the season, and it might
make you think he's slipping, hut Brandon
Graham is findinghis way around the
double teams. His 1.67 tackles for loss
per game puts him at No.15 in the .
nation. Although Graham was left offthe
Rotary Lombardi semifinal list, he's still
contributing with solid numbers you would
expect from the senior defensive end.

THE QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD

DISHING OUT THE GRADES

Which bowl game is
Michigan likely attending
this postseason?
Well, it will be a betterbowl than
last year.
Too soon?
Michigan needs just two more
wins to qualify for a bowl game,
and assuming one-win Delaware
State isn't the next Appalachian
State, the Wolverines will be sitting
pretty after Saturday.
Then, it just depends onwhere
Michigan finishes in the Big Ten.
The Wolverines already have two
conference losses, and no team has
won a Big Ten championship with
multiple defeats since 2000.
But Michigan has a good shot at
eclipsing .500 in the conference if
it can knock off Wisconsin or Penn
State. Wolverine fans can breathe
a sigh of relief - they will likely go
bowling in a warm-weather state,
which means it won't be at the
Little Caesars Pizza Bowl.

Is the force actually with
Tate Forcier?
That certainly seems to be the
case, unless the 188-pound signal
caller gets his bell rung a few more
times.
After a very good first six games
(57.2 completion percentage!
Nine touchdowns!), Forcier is the
clear-cut starter, although that's
assuming injuries don't prove to be
his downfall.
Forcier is the real deal because
he finds ways to win, and his
growth potential over the next
three seasons is exciting for fans.
The rest of the year should help
Forcier solidify his starting spot
for the future, even with the rivals.
com top-rated quarterback Devin
Gardner committed for next

Is Denard Robinson
more than a glorified
running back?
This could take a while to figure
out.
Rodriguez has insisted that
Robinson will play quarterback -
he did groom Pat White at West
Virginia, after all - but time and
time again, Robinson has proved to
be much more effective as a runner.
Saturday's game against
Delaware State will hopefully
provide a little insight. Robinson is
expected to get many more snaps
than he has so far this season. But
then again, even if he looks like the
next Tim Tebow, it is against the
Hornets.
Thetsecond-half Big Ten
matchups will be the best
barometer for Robinson's future,
especially with Gardner poised to
enroll in January.

Could Warren leave
school early?
No. This is Warren's first
excellent season, and his
playmaking ability is accentuated
by the secondary's lack of depth.
But then again, considering
defenses have largely avoided his
side of the field, Warren's numbers
are even more impressive this
season. Warren's statistics, with
three interceptions and 10 pass
breakups, are some of the best in
the conference.
At the moment, Warren doesn't
look likea first-rounder, and
another year under his belt would
significantly help his draft stock.
It seems unlikely right now, but
with Warren playing the way he is,
it's something to keep an eye on..

What will come of the
Free Press allegations?
With all of the Detroit Free Press
allegations coming out this season,
particularly the preseason report
that Rodriguez violated NCAA
practice regulations, it is almost a
sure thing that follow-ups are in
the works.
The practice-related accusations
are currently under investigation.
Although the findings aren't
expected to be released any time
soon, it'll be interesting to see if
they have any significant effect on
the program.
We don't expect the allegations
to have any direct impact on the
team, but you never know what
could happen.

THE PLAYERS/POSITIONS
THAT NEED TO STEP UP

OFFENSE DE ENSE
After getting off to a blistering start on the "Bend but not break" maybecome an
ground, Michigan hita speed bump against extremely overused cliche this season. Yardage-
the Spartans. It recovered against Iowa and is wise, Michigan is on pace for its worst defensive
now second in the conference in rush offense, year, yet the Wolverines somehow lock down
but the running backs still haven't managed to in the red zone. Brandon Graham and Donovan
overshadow comeback phenom Tate Forcier, Warren have been the lone highlights of the unit,
who has exceeded all expectations. Too many and their play has kept the defense from getting
three-and-outs and seven turnovers in the past a 'D' grade. Does the University give anything
two games knock the offense down to a 'B', less than a'C' in classes, anyway?
though.

THE MOST MEANINGFUL MOMENTS OF THE FIRST HALF

Boubacar Cissoko/J.T.
Fioyd, cornerbacks
Through six games, the
secondary has been the most
team's glaringweakness. The
Wolverines are dead last in
the Big Ten in passingyards
allowed per game, and the lack
of a true second cornerback
opposite stalwart Donovan
Warren has deeply hindered
their ability to find consistency
at the position.
one of these two needs to
step upo cornerback-turned-
safety-turned-cornerhack
Tiny Woolfolk can move hack
to strong safety, where his
speed can really help ashaky
defensive unit.
Obi Ezeh, middle
linebacker
Yes, Ezeh is sixth in the Big
Ten with 55 tackles. But there's
more to his position than
takedowns, especially in new
defensive coordinator Greg
Robinson's wacky scheme.
Ezeh's pass coverage leaves

much to be desired, and as the
"quarterback of the defense,"
it's up to the middle linebacker
to shoulder the load for a
defense that's on track to give
up almost 300 points - which
could potentiallybe the worst
in school history.
Greg Mathews, wide
receiver
In the 2008 Capital One Bowl,
Mathews had areakoutgame
- or that's what Michigan fans
thought at the time. Rspecially
after Mario Manningham and
Adrian Arrington left for the
NFL.
Through six games this season,
Mathews has the same number
of catches, seven, as in that one
bowl game - and just 24 more
total yards. He's also averaging
just 3.4 yards per punt return,
and he muffed a critical punt
late against Iowa that could
have changed the outcome of
the game.
Well, at least he had that one
touchdown against Notre
Dame.

Darryl Stonum, vide
receiver & kick returner
If Michigan is going to continue
to play in these tight, heart
attack-inducing games, special
teams is going to plays huge
factor. One could definitely
argue that Stonum is the reason
the Wolverines upset Notre
Dame, but the Texan has trailed
off since then.
Stonum was No. 15 in the
country in yards per kick return
after the Indiana game, hut in
the losses to Michigan State
and Iowa, he averaged just 18.8
yards per return. That definitely
kills the field-position battle.
The return game is essential to
the offense's success - and that
success rests on Stonum from
here on out.
Tate Forcier/
Denard Robinson,
quarterbacks
Here are the Daily, we're not
about to knock these two. They,
especially Forcier, have far
exceeded expectations - and
with their quick adaptation
to college football, there's no
way Michigan would be 4-2 at
the midway point. So, putting
Forcier and Robinson on this
list isn't necessarily negative -
we're just saying they need to
step up even more as leaders if
they Wolverines want to finish
strong.

SPECIAL T EAMS
Sophomore Darryl Stonum has gone from
stunning to just acceptable in the last couple
weeks, but is still just 147 yards away from
breaking Michigan's season record for kickoff
returns. Greg Mathews should find a cure for
that nagging senioritis, but for the most part,
he has been reliable. And who singlehandedly
boosted special teams by a full letter grade? It's
Zoltan Mesko, who has kicked a helluva ball
thus far.

COACHING
It takes a lot to groom two freshman
quarterbacks, especially when one has a full
head of shaggy, light brown hair and the other
sports impressive dreadlocks. Although both
Forcier and Denard Robinson have looked like
freshmen at times, Rodriguez and his staff
have made the necessary adjustments to ensure
the two learn the playbook at an appropriate
pace. But some questionable coaching at crucial
times, like the defensive coaches' inability to
anticipate schemes Michigan hasn't seen on
film, has cost the Wolverines. At some point,
the second-half adjustments need to happen
before the second half.

David Molk breaks his
foot against Eastern
Michigan
Center David Molk broke his foot
on a first-half play against Eastern
Michigan on Sept.19 and had
surgery two days later. His initial
prognosis suggested a return in
four to six weeks, and though he is
making progress, his exact return
date is still unknown.
Molk's injury has showed all too
well the value of an experienced
center. David Moosman, who
moved from right guard to fill
Molk's void, botched six snaps in
the next game against Indiana. The
offensive line, which had been one
of the most consistent units until
Molk's injury, has been struggling
to find its groove ever since.

Denard Robinson
outruns and outjukes
the Broncos
Tate Forcier threw his first
touchdown as a Wolverine to
put Michigan up 7-0 early, but
Denard Robinson answered him
one flashier. On his first play from
scrimmage, Robinson fumbled the
snap and drew collective gasps
of dismay from the Big House
crowd. But Robinson picked up
the ball and ran to the outside.
He shook off a tackler, cut back
toward the middle, found a hole
and broke free for 43 yards and
his first touchdown. The shocking
play showcased both Robinson's
greatest strength (blazing speed)
and his greatest weakness
(unfamiliarity with the offense).
Both would come back to help and
haunt him duringthe season's next
five games.

Mathews and Forcier
pull through in the clutch
vs. Notre Dame
Greg Mathews may only have
seven catches this season, but
one of them was the Wolverines'
biggest of the first half. Michigan,
desperately needing to prove itself
in the early-season game, trailed
Notre Dame 34-31 with 16 seconds
left. On second-and-goal, Forcier
threw under pressure to Mathews,
who caught the ball inside the one-
yard line and stepped into the end
zone. The play proved that Forcier
could calmly lead his team to a
comeback, and he would go on to
help Michigan come back against
Indiana and Michigan State.

With a chance to be the
hero, Forcier throws an
OT interception
That said, Forcier has also
showed he is human. The crazed
hype surrounding the freshman
quarterback after Michigan's 4-0
start followed him to East Lansing,
where the 1-3 Spartans were
determined to spoil the Wolverines'
record. After leading Michigan to
yet another improbable comeback
to force the game to overtime,
Forcier decided to go for the
end zone on third down - and
threw the ball directly at safety
Danny Fortener, who tipped the
ball enough for Michigan State
cornerback Chris L. Rucker to
catch it. Michigan State scored on
the ensuing possession to seal a
26-20 win. Forcier later called the
interception a "freshman mistake."

Michigan's defense
almost costs the team a
win against Indiana
Against Indiana, Tate Forcier's
leaping touchdown run and
two-point conversion run put the
Wolverines up by three with 9:15
left in the game. But that lead held
for just 18 seconds. On Indiana's
ensuing drive, Darius Willis took
the ball and ran 85 yards. Defensive
end Ryan Van Bergen said after
the game that the missed play was
the result of an incorrect check, a
mistake that he said was "something
very basic, first week." Though the
long run wasn't the beleaguered
secondary's fault, it was just another
big play the Michigan defense has
given up at a crucial moment this
season. The play gave Indiana
a four-point lead, which forced
Forcier and Co. to score a late
touchdown to win the game.
