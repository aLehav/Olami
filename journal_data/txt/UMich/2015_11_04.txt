THE STATEMENT

Student wins 
Ward 3 seat

LSA senior is first 

‘U’ student to 

secure council seat 

in two decades

By EMMA KERR and 
CAMY METWALLY

Daily News Editor and 

Daily Staff Reporter

LSA senior Zachary Ackerman 

secured a seat on Ann Arbor’s City 

Council in an uncontested race 
Tuesday night, with 90.68 percent 
of the vote. With all precincts 
reporting, Ackerman garnered 730 
votes from the 3rd Ward.

It has been more than two 

decades 
since 
someone 
in 

Ackerman’s age range has been 
elected to City Council. Ackerman 
is 22 and spending an extra 
semester at the University as a 
fifth-year senior due to taking time 
off to work on campaigns.

Incumbent Jane Lumm 
retains post on A2 Council

Democratic 

challenger Sally 

Hart Petersen loses 
by 29-point margin

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

In Ann Arbor’s only contested 

City Council race, incumbent Jane 
Lumm (I) defeated Sally Petersen 
(D) for the open seat in Ward 2, 

garnering 64.46 percent of the 
vote over Petersen’s 35.34 percent, 
with 100 percent of precincts 
reporting.

The turnout rate in Ward 2 was 

7.7 percent. On Tuesday, 1,283 
votes were cast. The ward has 
16,650 registered voters.

The result will prevent Petersen 

from returning to elected office in 
Ann Arbor, after serving on the 
council from 2012 to 2014 until she 
forgoed her re-election campaign 
to 
conduct 
an 
unsuccessful 

mayoral run. Petersen and Lumm 

were not available for comment by 
telephone Tuesday evening.

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 

Taylor and Councilmember Kirk 
Westphal (D–Ward 2) endorsed 
Petersen. Councilmembers Mike 
Anglin (D–Ward 5), Jack Eaton 
(D–Ward 4), Sumi Kailasapathy 
(D–Ward 
1) 
and 
Stephen 

Kunselman (D–Ward 3) endorsed 
Lumm.

The endorsements illustrates 

a split between members of the 
council 
aligned 
with 
Taylor 

and those who more frequently 

disagreed with his policy agenda.

The city’s forthcoming deer 

cull featured prominently in the 
Ward 2 race, and has generated 
debate in council over the last few 
months. The City Council voted 
in August to move forward with 
plans to manage the city’s deer 
population with a cull.

Lumm 
campaigned 
as 
a 

proponent for a deer cull while 
Petersen has voiced opposition to 
the plans.

Masha Gessen 
presented with 

24th annual 

Wallenberg Medal

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Russian 
journalist 
and 

activist Masha Gessen was 
awarded the 24th Wallenberg 
Medal 
on 
Tuesday 
night 

before a 250-person crowd in 
Rackham Auditorium.

Gessen has written 11 books 

and is known for taking a strong 
stance on the deteriorating 
human rights condition in Syria 
as well as her open criticism 
of Russian president Vladimir 
Putin. She is also an activist for 
gay rights in Russia. According 
to a press release, Gessen 
received the award for “her 
willingness to write and speak 
truth to power whatever the 
personal cost.”

The Wallenberg Medal is 

given annually to an outstanding 
humanitarian. The award was 
named for University alum 
Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish 
diplomat who saved tens of 
thousands of Jews in Nazi-
occupied 
Hungary 
during 

World War II. After accepting 
the medal, Gessen presented a 
lecture on the current state of 
affairs in Russia.

Gessen focused on the ways 

totalitarian systems are formed 
and how she sees this playing 
out in Russia. She said it’s 
difficult for Western countries 
to accept the existence of 
totalitarian societies.

“It was very difficult for the 

West to talk about totalitarian 
regimes because they seem 
preposterous,” 
Gessen 
said. 

“Who could really believe that 
you could use these simple ideas 
like the idea that certain races 
were fated to do better would 
lead to the extermination of 
millions of people.”

Vigil focuses on impacts of 
violence in Palestine, Israel

Students gather 
to discuss recent 
conflict in region

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

Lights illuminated the Diag 

on Tuesday evening as students 
gathered at the steps of Hatcher 
Graduate 
Library 
to 
honor 

victims of violence in Israel and 
Palestine.

The vigil was organized by 

LSA junior Nicole Khamis and 
LSA senior Devin Jones, who are 
both Palestinian-Americans with 
extended family members who 
have been affected by the area’s 
history of conflict. 

Most recently, tensions have 

been high in the area following 
a spate of terrorist attacks in the 
region largely aimed at Israelis, 

with four attacks occurring Oct. 
13. 

Khamis began the event by 

sharing statistics on the number 
of Palestinians killed and injured 
due to violence in either Palestine 
or Israel from live gun fire — 921 
in the past 30 days, according to 
the Palestinian Health Ministry.

She said it’s important to 

recognize statistics on the recent 
attacks in context of those deaths,

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Assembly also 

approves inclusion 
of mental health 

resources in syllabi

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Central Student Government on 

Tuesday discussed seven proposed 
changes to the Statement of Stu-
dent Rights and Responsibilities 
and passed a resolution to include 
mental health services in course 
syllabi.

The statement governs non-

academic behavioral conduct at 
the University. Amended every 
three years, the statement features 
expectations for student conduct, 
and suggests sanctions and disci-
plinary procedures for violations 
such as illegal drug and alcohol use, 
hazing and sexual misconduct.

CSG proposed seven amend-

ments this cycle: establish formal

Gessen argued that people 

need to take the repercussions 
of totalitarian regimes seriously, 
no matter how preposterous they 

seem, rather than risk the great 
tragedy that can occur if Western 
countries ignore them.

“We’re so rational we don’t 

like to believe in things that are 
preposterous, and it gives us a lot of 
satisfaction to feel more intelligent 
and just sort of sniff at things,” she 

said. “But it is so much better to 
have unjustified fear, to have let 
your imagination run wild, than to 
have let down your fellow human 
beings because you didn’t believe.”

Gessen spoke about how an 

entire country could be swayed by 
a single ideology. She said Russia’s 
past harsh rule has ruined the 
people’s ability to hold core values, 
and they are therefore susceptible 
to the shifting of ideologies. 
Totalitarianism, she said, not only 
sways public opinion, but renders 
people unable to form opinions in 
the first place.

Talking 
about 
Russia 

specifically, Gessen said Putin 
gained power by appealing to 
traditional values.

“The most important thing he 

did was back into an ideology,” she 
said. “He was trying to paint the 
protesters as others and when he 
started queerbaiting them, that’s 
when it worked. This idea of this 
traditional civilization presented 
itself, and the idea of the traditional 
civilization is a perfectly primitive 
and preposterous idea.”

Discussing what the West can 

do in response to Russia’s shift back 
toward a totalitarian state, Gessen 
said leaders should emphasize 
a system of politics based on 
morals 
rather 
than 
reason. 

Specifically with Russia’s position 
in the Ukraine, Gessen said it is 
important to take action from a 
moral standpoint, not a strategic 
one. She said the sanctions placed 
on Russia by the United States and 
Western Europe were logical, but 
predictably unsuccessful.

“It goes along with the idea that 

we have to be realistic and strategic 
and the only reason to do something 
is because it’s going to work,” she 
said. “What I’m suggesting is the 
reason to do something is not that 
it’s going to work, but that it’s the 
right thing to do.”

LSA 
senior 
Marion 
Berger 

said she found the talk very 
encouraging as a member of the 
LGBTQ community.

“As a queer person, it’s really 

inspiring to see another queer 
woman on the stage at a big event 
like this,” Berger said. “It’s really 
remarkable to have role models 
like Masha Gessen in the world 
and to see them be rewarded for 
the incredible work that they do, 
especially since this kind of work 
often goes unnoticed.”

AT NYU, IMAGE RAISES CONTROVERSY

Halloween party draws criticism

WEDNESDAY:

In Other Ivory Towers

After a video projection of what 

some claim to have been a silhou-
etted man dying by suicide was 
projected at the New York Uni-
versity School of Law’s annual 
Fall Ball, a student organization 
within the law school wrote an 
open letter to its deans in protest, 
the Washington Square News 
reported Monday.

The organization, called the 

Mental Health Law and Justice 
Association, wrote in its letter that 
other projected images included 
displays of interpersonal violence 
and violence against women. The 
Fall Ball party was Halloween-
themed, and because of that, some 
students said the images were 
more “Halloween fun” than they 
were inappropriate.

“For members of our commu-

nity who have lost someone to 
suicide or who have had personal 
experiences, this topic is not a 
Halloween gimmick,” the letter 
states. “We believe that this unfor-
tunate situation is the result of the 
stigma surrounding mental health 
and widespread misunderstand-
ing of suicide.”

As a result of the letter, the 

MHLJA will meet with the law 
school administration to discuss 
the topic.

UCLA switches meal plan 

options

In response to low participation 

rates, the University of California, 
Los Angeles switched from pro-
viding a supplemental meal plan 
for students adhering to kosher 
and halal diets to incorporating 

those meal options into regular 
university dining, the Daily Bruin 
reported Tuesday.

Originally, students could buy 

the supplemental plans in addition 
to their regular meal plans, which 
cost about $2,600 for lunch and 
dinner meal options. Kosher and 
halal foods are those which are 
prepared according to the Jewish 
and Islamic faiths, respectively. 
The dietary laws include restric-
tions on types of meat and food 
preparation, for example. UCLA 
Dining Services officials stated 
that they will refund students who 
purchased the supplemental meal 
plan, but will continue to offer the 
same halal and kosher options for 
lunch and dinner until the end of 
the quarter.

Shraddha Bhatawadekar, Nehru-Fulbright Academic and Professional Excellence fellow, discusses the importance 
of preserving cultural heritage sites in India at the Museum of Art on Tuesday.

ZOEY HOLMSTROM /Daily

University President Mark Schlissel presents the Wallenberg Medal to Masha 
Gessen, Russian and American journalist, author and activist, at Rackham 
Auditorium on Tuesday. 
Lecture highlights culture 
preservation in Mumbai

Fulbright fellow 
talks impact of 
development on 
heritage sites

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Shraddha Bhatawadekar, a 

Fulbright-Nehru Academic and 
Professional Excellence fellow, 
began her presentation on India 
with a joke — that the first thing 
people often want to know is 
how she survives the Michigan 
winter.

However, 
the 
ultimate 

goal of Bhatawadekar’s dis-
cussion Tuesday night at the 
University was not talking 
about Michigan’s climate, but 
rather presenting the chal-
lenges 
of 
maintaining 
and 

preserving India’s cultural her-
itage in archaeological sites.

The event was sponsored by 

the Museum Studies Program 
and the Center for South Asian 
Studies.

Bhatawadekar, who earned 

her bachelor’s degree in his-
tory at Mumbai University, 
has worked in archaeology, 

research and museum devel-
opment throughout her career. 
She is currently in residence at 
the University and working on 
a research project about com-
municating the significance of 
India’s archeological heritage. 

Bhatawadekar told attend-

ees that preserving heritage is 
crucial, despite the many chal-
lenges that arise while doing so.

Her sentiment was echoed 

by Anthropology Prof. Carla 
Sinopoli, director of the Muse-
um Studies Program, who said 
the program wanted to explore 
issues of preserving heritage 
from an international perspec-
tive as part of an ongoing series 
of talks.

“(We’re) looking at the range 

of both threats to heritages and 
museums and the responses to 
them in the Middle East, South 
Asia, Greece, and . . . in our own 
backyard,” Sinopoli said.

Speaking 
specifically 
to 

Mumbai, Bhatawadekar empha-
sized the importance of heritage 
preservation because of its cul-
tural impact.

“Imagine India without the 

Taj Mahal or the world without 
one of its wonders,” she said.

Bhatawadekar described her 

native city, Mumbai, as a heritage 

city, which is defined as a city 
that is has particular cultural 
importance to a country.

Important heritage sites in 

Mumbai include Sopara Stupa, 
an ancient port city for interna-
tional trade, the Kanheri Caves, 
a center for Buddhist learning, 
the Ambreshwar Shiva Temple 
and most well known, the Taj 
Mahal. Many of these landmarks 
are considered World Heritage 
Sites by the United Nations Edu-
cational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization and are significant 
drivers of India’s tourism indus-
try.

However, Bhatawadekar said 

Mumbai is also characterized by 
another phenomenon — industri-
al growth. Today the most popu-
lous city in India, the population 
of Greater Mumbai has grown to 
approximately 12.4 million peo-
ple as of 2011, averaging a den-
sity of about 54,000 people per 
square mile.

In cities like Mumbai, the 

pressures of urbanization con-
stantly influence the distinction 
between the old and the new and 
threaten the balance between 
conservation and development, 
Bhatawadekar said.

venues for students to weigh in 
on several amendments, includ-
ing the addition of an honor 
pledge, include statement edu-
cation 
during 
new 
student 

orientation, specification of a 
consistent 3-year amendment 
cycle, specify the scope of viola-
tions and formalize the Univer-
sity president’s need to chose 
amendments before the end of 
the school year.

CSG president Cooper Charl-

ton, an LSA senior, said CSG 
General Counsel Jacob Pearl-
man, a Public Policy sophomore, 
was largely responsible for the 
creation and submission of the 
amendments.

“This amendment process was 

truly gruesome,” Charlton said.

Pearlman 
addressed 
the 

assembly 
about 
the 
seven 

amendments, which were sub-
mitted Monday to the Student 
Relations Advisory Committee.

CSG’s proposals — as well as 

proposed amendments submit-
ted by the Executive Officers 
and the Faculty Senate — will 
be sent to the Student Relations 
Advisory 
Committee, 
which 

serves as a liaison between the 
Faculty Senate and CSG.

Recommended amendments 

will then be filtered through E. 
Royster Harper, vice president 
for student life, and Timothy 
Lynch, University vice president 
and general counsel.

Once the proposals have been 

reviewed, the Office of the Vice 
President and General Counsel 
will forward its recommenda-
tions to the Office of the Presi-
dent by March 2016.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel would make final deci-
sions on which revisions will go 
into effect by July 1 of next year.

Transparency

Pearlman said CSG should 

play a role not just in adding 
amendments to the statement, 
but 
approving 
amendments 

put forth by other governing 
branches. He said all amend-
ments should be filtered through 
CSG, which is largely overlooked 
through the current process.

“Skipping student input here, 

I don’t like that,” Pearlman said. 
“An executive officer or the 
Faculty Senate could propose 
amendments to SRAC that CSG 
would never see … Giving CSG 
the power to recommend or not 
reccomend all proposals and not 

simply their own.”

Honor pledge

After the January ski trip at 

a Northern Michigan ski trip 
resulted in thousands of dollars 
of damage last year, a CSG task 
force commissioned a proposal 
to add an additional honor code 
as a supplement to the statement.

The code stipulates it is sym-

bolic rather than binding, and 
is meant to remind students to 
conduct themselves in a way 
that reflects the University’s ide-
als and values.

“Since the Statement of Stu-

dent Rights and Responsibilities 
is a lengthy document, this short 
honor pledge would be more 
tangible to students to famil-
iarize themselves with or even 

memorize,” the code states.

Pearlman said the code is 

meant to help students rather 
than make them susceptible to 
punishment by the administra-
tion.

“When you guys go out and are 

making decisions, no one’s asking 
you to memorize this document,” 
he said.

Education

This 
amendment 
proposes 

that students be educated on the 
statement 
during 
orientation. 

Pearlman said doing so during 
orientation would allow the Uni-
versity to reach students when 
they are most receptive to new 
information.

Frequency of cycle

Though in recent years the 

statement has been amended 
every three years, specific cycle 
length is not currently included in 
the statement. This amendment 
would cement the three-year 
amendment cycle.

Scope

This proposal basically ensures 

that students are held to the ver-
sion of the code that was in place 
when they committed a violation.

Communication

This amendment addresses the 

University president’s role and 
obligations with the Statement.

Currently, Pearlman said the 

University president reserves the 
right to alter the Statement at any 
point in time. However, Univer-

sity President Emerita Mary Sue 
Coleman always decided which 
amendments would be chosen 
before the end of Winter semes-
ter, while students were still on 
campus. The amendment pro-
poses that Coleman’s precedent of 
approving amendments at a speci-
fied time become a requirement.

Executive communications

Charlton also spoke about the 

progress CSG has made with the 
Faculty Senate’s decision regard-
ing the release of course evalua-
tions for student consideration. 
Last Monday, the body voted to 
support a delay in releasing course 
evaluation data to students.

“We’ve progressed actually 

quite positively,” Charlton said.

Charlton said the two ongo-

ing conversations between the 
Faculty Senate and CSG regard-
ing course evaluations are their 
release to students and the cre-
ation of a committee to re-eval-
uate the instrument of gathering 
course evaluations.

Charlton said CSG asking for 

the release of the data by Winter 
2016 is still on the table.

“CSG still wants to see course 

evaluations be public,” Charlton 
said, “However that conversation 
has progressed into an ask of giv-
ing course evaluations to advisers 
with the contextualization they 
requested initially.”

Charlton said the Senate Advi-

sory Committee on University 
Affairs is in support of at least 
releasing the course evaluation to 
advisors, so that they can talk to 
their students about it.

“Some people are calling this a 

compromise,” Charlton said, “I’m 
calling it common sense.”

A forum on the topic will be 

held Nov. 16 in CSG chambers at 
the Michigan Union.

Mental health in syllabi

CSG voted on a resolution to 

add mental health services in 
syllabus language, which passed 
unanimously.

LSA junior Sierra Stone, one of 

the authors of the resolution, said, 
in addition to faculty members, 
Graduate Student Instructors will 
be trained about how to address 
mental health in their syllabi.

holding elected office in Ann 
Arbor isn’t due to a lack of trying. 
University alum Peter Nicolas 
was elected to City Council in 
1992 at the age of 21, and since 
then, a number of students have 
attempted to run for the position. 
Ackerman was the first in a while 
to succeed.

Ackerman 
was 
chosen 
as 

the 
Democratic 
candidate 

in the city’s August primary, 
in which he unseated long-
time 
Councilmember 
Stephen 

Kunselman (D–Ward 3).

At a watch party Tuesday 

evening 
attended 
by 
both 

Ackerman 
and 
fellow 
newly 

elected 
councilmember 
Chip 

Smith, 
attendees 
expressed 

support for both candidates.

In an interview during the 

watch party, Ackerman discussed 
the disadvantage faced by many 
University 
students 
in 
the 

community who would like to 
voice their opinions.

In particular, he cited the 

fact that with primary elections 
in August, few students are on 
campus to participate in elections.

“Most of the deciding votes of 

the city happen in August when 
only one-tenth of the student 
body is enrolled in classes,” 
Ackerman said. “That’s not to 
say that I think the city should 
be run by representatives of the 
student body. I think there has to 
be a critical balance because no 
temporary resident should dictate 
policy for the next 20 years.”

LSA junior Samuel McMullen, 

who ran for City Council as a 
freshman but was defeated, said it is 
refreshing to see younger members 
elected. He said though the city is 
largely composed of students, the 
demographic is underrepresented 
in local government.

“We have a pretty big imbalance 

in terms of policy, where the source 
of the policy doesn’t match up 
with the people that it’s affecting,” 
McMullen said.

Ackerman said he focused on 

running an active and personal 
campaign 
in 
connecting 
to 

residents across the city, knocking 
on more than 4,000 doors.

After 
campaign 
season, 

Ackerman said he plans to hold 
two coffee hours per week, 
providing Ann Arbor residents 
with the opportunity to share 
concerns. He also aims to attend 
a variety of community events to 
foster collaboration with citizens 

and 
continue 
to 
strengthen 

connections with them.

“I think we often times have 

high 
level 
conversations 
that 

ignore 
what 
people 
want,” 

Ackerman said. “I ran to be 
a responsive leader, and I am 
committed fully to that.”

Along with limited student 

representation on City Council, 
student turnout in city elections 
has also typically been low, though 
student organizations this year 
cited Ackerman’s candidacy as a 
potential path to higher turnout.

LSA sophomore Sara Lebow, 

chair of the Central Student 
Government commission Voice 
Your Vote, was out on the Diag on 
Tuesday encouraging students to 
vote.

Though student turnout is 

usually highest in years when 
presidential or state elections 
are on the ballot, Lebow said 
council elections are important for 
students, too.

“I guess young people a lot of 

times have pretty low turnouts, 
which means the elections tend 
to represent the votes of the older 
populations,” Lebow said. “But, 
in a city like Ann Arbor, where 
so much of the population is 
people between 18 and 30, you 
need people voting in the local 

elections, which is going to affect 
them directly.”

Turnout this year remained 

significantly 
low 
in 
student-

dominated precincts, though it’s 
difficult to fully discern the impact 
of the student vote because voting 
wards are drawn from the center 
of downtown — meaning students 
are divided among the wards. 
Turnout was also low across the 
city, since the majority of council 
races were uncontested.

The Michigan Union reported 

a voter turnout of 0.81 percent of 
those registered in Ward 1’s first 
and second precinct and a voter 
turnout of 1.15 percent for Ward 
4’s first precinct. The Michigan 
League, 
which 
was 
assigned 

Ward 3 precincts 1 and 2, had 
a voter turnout of 1.20 percent. 
Seven ballots were cast at Palmer 
Commons, five for Sally Petersen 
and two for Jane Lumm. At 
Pierpont Commons, six ballots 
were cast with a voter turnout of 
0.45 percent.

Lebow 
cited 
Ackerman’s 

campaign as an opportunity to 
mitigate the underrepresentation 
of students in Ann Arbor city 
government because his candidacy 
represents an increase in student 
involvement. That involvement, 
she said, begins with getting more 

students to vote.

The 
University’s 
Chapter 

of 
College 
Democrats 
also 

encouraged 
students 
to 
vote 

throughout the week, holding 
a forum last week and going 
door to door for candidates 
running as Democrats in the city 
election. They also encouraged 
a competition between students 
living on campus in East Quad 
Residence 
Hall, 
West 
Quad 

Residence Hall, on the Hill and 
on North Campus who vote at the 
Michigan League, the Michigan 
Union, Palmer Commons and 
Pierpont Commons respectively.

In campaigning, Ackerman said 

he sought to hear the voices of a 
broad range of residents, adding 
that his agenda and outreach 
focused on all residents, including 
but not limited to students. He said 
thought hearing from a diverse 
array of citizens in all forms of 
civic engagement was important 
for elected officials.

“I think too often, especially 

at the local level, we only get to 
hear from one segment of the 
population,” 
Ackerman 
said. 

“We’re a diverse city of age, 
socioeconomic class and race, and 
I think hearing every side of the 
story is critical to making policy 
decisions.”

previous experience on the council, 
transparency and attitudes toward 
new development within the city.

This election also drew large 

amounts of fundraising by both 
campaigns. 
Petersen 
raised 

$33,640 and spent $27,556. Lumm 
raised $25,035 and spent $12,418. 
Both also posted small amounts of 
late contributions filed after Oct. 
23.

Lumm served as an independent 

on 
council 
since 
2011, 
and 

previously held a council seat as a 
Republican in the 1990s. In April, 
she said the 2015 race would be her 
last. Before assuming a council seat 
in 2012, Petersen held positions 
in marketing at several firms in 
the Ann Arbor area and currently 
serves on the board of the Neutral 
Zone.

The University’s chapter of 

the College Democrats endorsed 
Petersen and actively canvassed 
door-to-door and made phone 
calls on her behalf. “While City 
Council doesn’t seem like it has 
much of an influence on you 
directly, that’s where a lot of the 
day-to-day things of your life are 
decided,” said LSA junior Stephen 
Culbertson, the College Democrats 
communications chair, Tuesday 
afternoon. “In a local municipal 
elections students don’t really see 
it as relevant to them as national 
politics, so we definitely want to 
encourage students to be involved 
at the local level.”

Tuesday’s 
overall 
voter 

turnout in Ann Arbor was 12.29 
percent. Incumbent Sabra Briere, 
LSA senior Zachary Ackerman 
and incumbent Jack Eaton, all 
Democrats, won unopposed races 
in Wards 1, 3 and 4 respectively. 
Democrat 
Chip 
Smith 
easily 

defeated a write-in campaign for a 
seat in Ward 5.

adding that Palestinians are not 
inherently violent people.

“I think it’s really important, 

once we look at the statistics, not 
to label Palestinians as people who 
are inherently violent and people 
who are violent without reason,” 
she said.

Following the statistics, Jones 

read the names of 66 Palestinians 
and eight Israelis who died over 
the past 30 days, after which 
students paid homage with a 
moment of silence. 

Organizers 
indicated 
that 

the event, which spanned both 
a reading of names as well as 
discussion about the broader issues 
in the region, was set to honor both 
Palestinian and Israeli victims, 
though 
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 

Joel Reinstein offered remarks 
condemning the Israeli occupation 
of Palestine and encouraging vigil 
attendees to boycott Israel during 
the second part of the event.

His sentiment was echoed by 

most speakers.

“This situation is unspeakable, 

but it’s not complicated,” he 
said. “This is a violence between 
oppressor and oppressed, between 
occupying soldiers and people 
whose lives are made worse than 
death.”

Khamis also cited the Israeli 

occupation 
during 
the 
event, 

calling it the root cause of the 
violence in Israel and Palestine.

“Something 
that’s 
really 

important to contextualize is 
the fact that when we look at 
the media, everything is novel ... 
everything is new,” she said. “But 
this isn’t a new problem. This 
has been going on because of the 
occupation that has been going on 
for Palestinians in the West Bank 
and in the Gaza since 1967.”

In 1967, Israel launched a 

series of preemptive air attacks 
against Egypt, which had been 
amassing troops along Israel’s 
border in the Sinai Peninsula. The 
resulting conflict — the Six Day 
War — ended with Israel gaining 
control of several new territories, 
including the Sinai Peninsula, 
Gaza and the West Bank. In 1977, 
Israel withdrew from the Sinai 

Peninsula. There is still an Israeli 
presence in the West Bank.

Khamis, who also spoke during 

the vigil, cited her personal 
experiences as a Palestinian living 
in small town in the West Bank, 
which she said is now surrounded 
by a 25-foot wall. She also said 
Palestinians in some areas aren’t 
allowed to visit other parts of the 
region and cannot marry others 
from different towns. 

“All 
of 
these 
are 
against 

international human rights, and to 
subject a population to these racists 
policies is wrong,” she said. “To sit 
here and allow these injustices to 
keep going, a part of us dies. I hope 
as a Michigan community we can 
come together to condemn this 
violence and demand for peace, but 
furthermore that this occupation 
needs to end.”

Jones echoed Khamis’ remarks, 

and said he thinks Palestinian 
citizens of Israel are persecuted.

“This isn’t just a Palestinian 

thing, for Palestinians who live in 
the West Bank or Gaza,” he said. 
“This is for the Palestinians that 
make up 20 percent of Israel’s 
population. Palestinian citizens 

of Israel have been arrested for 
Facebook posts and for merely 
existing and for showing up in 
support of things that are done for 
other Palestinians.”

In an interview with the Daily, 

Jones said he believes Palestinians 
are suffering the most in the 
ongoing conflict in the area.

“This isn’t mutually affecting 

both sides,” he said. “There are 
people from both sides that are 
injured, but the toll suffered by 
Palestinian is so much higher than 
any other side.”

In an interview with the Daily 

after the event, LSA senior Daniel 
Pearlman, who attended the vigil, 
said he was disappointed that 
the event was heavily politicized. 
Pearlman is a member of WolvPac, 
a political group on campus that 
promotes a strong relationship 
between the United States and 
Israel. 
WolvPac 
joined 
with 

several other Israel-related groups 
on campus last month to host a 
vigil for victims of terror in Israel.

“It seemed like a good cause 

and it seemed like it would be 
beneficial to everybody who has 
family and friends affected, Israeli 

and Palestinians,” he said. “It was 
very, very one-sided, and I was 
really disappointed to see that. 
There are people that are dying 
on both sides, and I thought that 
they were being sacrificed for the 
promotion of a political cause. I’m 
still happy I went, I just really wish 
it wasn’t for this purpose.”

Speaking near the end of the 

vigil, Khamis said the goal of the 
event was to demonstrate that 
the violence in the region impacts 
a range of individuals in the 
University community.

“Just know that people are on 

this campus, not just Palestinian, 
both sides are being affected by 
this issue,” she said. “Just keep that 
in your hearts. If you pray, pray for 
peace. I hope that at the end of the 
day we can all come together as a 
Michigan community and put an 
end to this violence.”

“This situation is a lot closer to 

home than people think and that 
it’s affecting everyone,” she said. 
“I think it’s walking away with 
more context on the issue than 
just names, and knowing that it’s 
an issue that’s impacting students 
here.”

Public Policy sophomore Jacob Pearlman proposes amendments to the 
Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities during the Central Student 
Government meeting Tuesday in the Michigan Union.

Wu donates $10 
million to ‘U’ China 
partnership

University 
alumnus 
and 

investor John Wu, and his wife, 
Jane Sun, donated $10 million 
to the University of Michigan-
Shanghai Jiao Tong University 
Joint Institute. 

The 
Joint 
Institute 
was 

founded in 2006 and is located 
on the campus of Shanghai 
Jiao 
Tong 
University. 
The 

Joint Institute consists of 1,280 
students studying mechanical, 
electrical 
and 
computer 

engineering. 

The donation will set up 

the John Wu and Jane Sun 
Endowment 
Fund, 
which 

will 
support 
professorships, 

scholarships, faculty awards and 
student entrepreneurship funds, 
among other programs.

Wu 
graduated 
from 
the 

University 
in 
1989 
with 
a 

Bachelor of Science in computer 
science. He then worked senior 
positions at Yahoo! and Alibaba, 
a Chinese e-retailer. 

“The University of Michigan 

and 
Shanghai 
Jiaotong 

University provided me with 
deeply meaningful educational 
opportunities. Jane and I are 
delighted to support the Joint 
Institute, and we look forward 
to the continued success of 
students and faculty,” Wu said.

6,000 Detroit 
casino workers 
authorize strike

According to the Detorit Free 

Press, 
roughly 
6,000 
casino 

workers 
authorized 
union 

leaders to call a strike amid 
contract disputes between the 
Detroit 
Casino 
Council 
and 

three gambling halls: Greektown 
Casino, MGM Grand Detroit and 
MotorCity Casino., The Detroit 
Free Press reported. The Detroit 
Casino Council is a consortium 
of four unions. The DCC asked 
its members for permission to 
authorize a strike just three days 
after state and federal mediators 
called for a “cooling off” break 
between the two sides in the 
negotiations, which have been 
ongoing since August 24th. 

Dave 
DeLong, 
secretary 

treasurer of Teamsters Local 
372, a union, and a member of 
the bargaining committee said 
healthcare is an issue of contention 
among workers. 

“I can tell you that healthcare 

has been the major stumble 
block here,” DeLong said. “Our 
members would like to keep the 
current coverage that they have 
without any increased cost.”

Michigan Senate 
passes road 
funding bills 

If fee and tax increases 

passed in the Michigan senate 
become law, Michigan drivers 
should expect an increase in $20 
in registration fees and $1.17 
more for a 15 -gallon fill-up, 
The Detroit Free Press reports. 
These increases are part of a 
$1.2-billion road funding plan.

Republicans in the Senate 

passed the bill, which aims 
to raise $400 million from 
increased fuel taxes, $200 mil-
lion from higher registration 
fees while taking $600 million 
from the state’s general fund. 

The plan also calls for an 

income tax rollback for Michi-
gan residents that would start 
in 2023 if the bill passes through 
the state House and is signed by 
Gov. Rick Snyder. 

Senate Majority Leader Arlan 

Meekhof (R-West Olive) expects 
the package of bills to recieve 
the support of both the House 
and Gov. Snyder. 

“It’s going to help our econ-

omy,” 
Meekhof 
said. 
“Not 

everything that we send out is 
perfect.” 

Senate Minority Leader Jim 

Ananich (D-Flint) said he would 
encourage Gov. Snyder to veto 
the bill because he feels its 
delayed tax and fee increases 
signify a delay in improvement 
on the roads.

M

illennials have been cited as one of 
the most narcissistic generations 
in comparison to Baby Boomers 

and Gen Xers. In an age of 
selfies, instant gratification 
and self-assurance in their 
ability to manipulate tech-
nology, it’s no surprise mil-
lennials would be perceived 
as vain.

Yet is there a moment 

when this obsession with 
the self directs an inward 
focus on self-awareness and 
self-consciousness in a way 
that’s actually productive? 

Self-consciousness 
is 

typically seen with a nega-
tive connotation under the premise that one is 
unsure of oneself. I would challenge that prem-
ise. I view self-consciousness as being deliber-
ate and fully aware of one’s own existence. In 
the midst of a generation of self-photographers 
who capture images of our most beautiful, 
most adventurous, strongest and accomplished 
moments, it can be challenging to critically self-
evaluate our internal feelings with our relation-
ship with ourselves.

College is a transformational stage — a piv-

otal marker in defining what makes each of us 
unique. The years spent in college are often 
encouraged to be used as a period of self-dis-
covery. By the end of one’s college career, a 
student should be able to answer the question, 
“Who are you?”

Students are often befuddled by this ques-

tion. Their responses are usually a composi-
tion of one-dimensional characteristics such as 
their major, their year in school, activities they 
are involved in, how they self-identify and the 
beauty pageant answer of wanting to make the 
world a better place.

These obvious adjectives only graze the sur-

face of who we are. “Who are you?” is not an 
easy question to answer; it requires thoughtful 
understanding of oneself. Few times in life do 
people set aside time to freely and intentionally 
think about their priorities in life, how their 
background influences those priorities, identify 
their weaknesses, and strengthen and create a 
realistic plan for themselves to make those pri-
orities tangible. 

As I recall hearing my freshman year during 

a Black Student Union meeting, college is the 
best time to be selfish. With an infinite amount 
of responsibilities, it can be difficult to strategi-
cally use college to prioritize your experiences 
around getting to know oneself holistically, and 
to know how one’s personality is enriched by 
academics, extracurriculars and professional 
opportunities. In college, there is an innumer-
able amount of chances for students to heighten 
their personal development. Such opportuni-
ties can make students feel overwhelmed with 
options, adding to the daily stresses many 
undergo. Through the duration of my time in 
college, Rihanna’s “Question Existing” chorus 
constantly reminds me of three questions I can 
use to check my self-awareness:

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances are given, question existing
Rihanna’s lyrics force me to reflect on what I 

elect to involve myself in.

Why am I doing this? What benefit does this 

give to me? What do I have to contribute? Am I 
really giving the most of myself that I can to make 
the most out of my experience and to feel utilized?

These questions serve dual purposes, both 

as an exercise of checking one’s self-conscious-
ness and boosting self-confidence. How con-
fident am I in my own abilities, talents and 
endurance to create and become the best ver-
sion I perceive myself to be? How will I hold 
myself accountable for making sure I meet my 
goals and expectations?

Distinguishing expectations I set for 

myself and the expectations others have for 
me is a process in itself. It can be difficult to 
detach one from the other; often times, oth-
ers’ expectations can determine how we proj-
ect ourselves to the world. Yet, our passions 
and talents best display themselves when we 
set our own expectations.

As David Brooks, political and cultural 

commentator, brilliantly points out in his 
article about passion, “People who live with 
passion start out with an especially intense 
desire to complete themselves. We are the 
only animals who are naturally unfinished. 
We have to bring ourselves to fulfillment, to 
integration and to coherence ... (People with 
passion) construct themselves inwardly by 
expressing themselves outwardly.”

Self-fulfillment is a lifelong journey. The 

desire to complete oneself can be powerful, so 
much so that it can be destructive to develop-
ing intimacy with ourselves. There’s a fine line 
between self-consciousness being productive 
and being harmful. When the process becomes 
antagonizing or isolating, we become vulnera-
ble to doubt and fear, and can begin to mistrust 
our abilities. If we give into these misgivings, 
we stunt our own personal growth and fail to 
challenge ourselves to adjust to our current 
stage in the self-learning process. In our reflec-
tions, we must know ourselves well enough to 
identify these boundaries, and recognize when 
our discomfort comes from true pain rather 
than from the fear of understanding a level of 
ourselves we never had encountered before.

In one of James Baldwin’s best works, “No 

Name in the Street,” he wrote, “I have always 
been struck, in America, by an emotional pov-
erty so bottomless, and a terror of human life, of 
human touch, so deep that virtually no Ameri-
can appears able to achieve any viable, organic 
connection between his public stance and his 
private life.”

In a global society that seems emotionally 

bankrupt — reminding its inhabitants con-
stantly that Black lives don’t matter, where our 
schools are still segregated by race and income, 
where civil liberties are contractual, where 
laws sustain cycles of poverty and second-class 
citizenry for ex-offenders from our iniquitous 
criminal justice system, where structures of 
power can commit heinous crimes against 
human rights while powerful nations act as 
bystanders and where historical injustices still 
need to be absolved — it’s imperative that we 
are rooted in fundamental understanding of 
ourselves and our role in this society.

To be our most authentic selves, our public 

stances and private thoughts must conjoin at 
a comfortable level of dissonance. Self-inter-
rogation can be draining, but it’s necessary for 
growth. If we do not know ourselves intimately, 
how do we know our place in the world? How 
can we relate to one another? How can we 
become agents of change and progress if we do 
not challenge ourselves to evolve?

But before you answer those questions, 
 

take a selfie.

I 

don’t believe in ghosts and 
probably never will, despite 
my father’s best efforts. He 

grew up off a 
little 
wooded 

lane called Cuba 
Road. It’s sup-
posedly one of 
the most haunt-
ed places in Illi-
nois, and had the 
stories to boot: 
“There’s a ghost 
of an old man 
who walks the 
road back and 
forth looking for 
his family,” he’d 
say. “Never pick him up, Tommy, 
when you’re old enough to drive.”

And then, of course, there was 

the ghost of the tricycle-riding 
5-year-old. The peddling spectre 
would appear if you drove past the 
old asylum. “I’m not lying to you, 
son. You best stay away from that 
old asylum, now, you hear?”

I never did confirm if there’s an 

old asylum out by Cuba Road, but 
not for lack of looking. In middle 
school, we’d hike through the 
marsh that’s just north of Cuba 
Road, never finding anything but a 
rusty saw we assumed, naturally, 
the asylum used for lobotomies. 
It wasn’t ghosts or death we were 
afraid of, but boredom, as most chil-
dren are.

But it’s possible, growing up, to 

learn to be afraid of the dark. With 
good reason.

When I was 16 years old, I spent 

a week on an Indian reservation in 
South Dakota. I was doing charity 
work, and that sort of thing was 
expected of a young person from 
a good Christian background and 
a well-to-do town. And who, one 
day, would need something to write 
about in college application essays.

We worked most days fixing up 

houses. Sometimes we built fences, 
protecting the Lakota’s pastures 
from coyotes and wild dogs in the 
reservation’s interior. Much of the 
reservation is 400 square miles of 
prairie, empty except for predators 
and wild horses. It was also the site 
of the notorious pre-Columbian 
Crow Creek Massacre. Somewhere 
out there is a mass grave, a remnant 
of a conflict in which the invaders 
scalped most villagers and the oth-

ers were decapitated, though I sup-
pose that’s not mutually exclusive.

Kids of the reservation know not 

to wander into the interior, mostly. 
Sometimes a young one will get 
lost. I heard a story once about a 
5-year-old who followed a stray dog 
out of camp and never came back. 
They looked for a few days with-
out any sign of him, though no one 
knew how he got that far.

The last night of the trip, after 

the sweat lodge, we were given time 
to reflect. I was never one for reflec-
tion, especially at 16, and managed 
to convince a few other volunteers 
to hike into the interior.

“My wallet,” I lied. “I must have 

left it by the sage fields.”

I just wanted to see the stars 

from out there. They were the best 
on the reservation since there was 
no light.

“I hike at home all the time,” I 

said. “And I want to pick some sage 
as a souvenir.”

I didn’t pick sage while the Lako-

ta were around, since their custom 
is to pick ritual sage in a particular 
fashion while making offerings of 
tobacco as payment.

We lost the trail within an hour. 

A mile into our hike, we saw a black 
dog staring at us, eyes glowing in 
the flashlight beam. We ran until 
we realized we’d lost the path. Now, 
the flashlight was blinking out, and 
we were hopelessly lost. What’s 
more, our luck had turned sour. 
I tripped and landed on a cactus. 
Another hiker tripped and fell into 
a shallow ravine. It had been about 
three hours by now. We wondered 
if they would start looking for us 
soon. We wondered if they even 
noticed we were gone. And lastly, 
we thought about the missing little 
boy who followed the stray dog, 
and the black dog that had stared 
at us and scared us off the trail, and 
how diseased it looked, and how we 
could all smell it, still, an oppres-
sive stench that conflated with the 
darkness to terrify us.

I had a bundle of sage in my 

fist, which I’d taken without offer-
ing any tobacco. When the group 
turned on each other, a la “The 
Blair Witch Project,” my stolen sage 
and I were the target.

“Just put it back,” some of them 

said. “You don’t know. I know you 
don’t believe but you don’t know,” 

they begged.

But I did know. Taking a plant 

didn’t have anything to do with get-
ting lost. “OK,” I said, pretending 
to drop the bundle. But I kept it. I 
tucked it into my back pocket.

It was fine until someone point-

ed the flashlight at a bush, and 
I thought it was the black dog. I 
sprinted away, off into the dark-
ness, leaving the group behind.

Here’s what I learned wandering 

around a haunted Indian reserva-
tion at night by myself: It doesn’t 
matter if the ghosts are real if the 
fear is. Fear got me lost, not ghosts, 
but the result was the same. I might 
never be found.

I dropped the sage. No one was 

there to see it, so I didn’t do it for 
them. But it was my way of admit-
ting to myself that I was afraid. 
Sometimes that’s all you can do in 
the face of ghosts: admit that you 
are afraid, and that you don’t know 
what’s next, and that you’re sorry, 
and scared, and that you are afraid, 
you are afraid.

When they found me, I was 

walking deeper into the interior. 
I’d heard a howling; I was hoping 
it was the dogs around camp. Ten 
Lakota kids went looking for us in 
an off-roader and found the rest of 
the group. They spent the better 
part of an hour following me in. 
The Lakota had a black dog with 
them, covered in swollen ticks and 
with hardly any hair. His name was 
Caleb, and he helped them find us.

“We’ve got to go,” the kid driving 

said. “Haven’t you noticed? A storm 
is coming in from the west.”

That was why it had been so 

dark. A cloud moved toward camp, 
blinking out the stars as it came.

By the time we got back to camp, 

wind was ripping our tents from 
the ground. We slept in the chief’s 
basement, all of us curled up like a 
mass of voles, and in the morning 
we collected what was left of 
 

our belongings.

We found our things 100 yards 

from where they were. Almost all of 
our things, anyways. I lost a pair of 
jeans, the one with my wallet in the 
back pocket. I wonder sometimes, if 
I went back to the sage field where I 
lied and said it was, if I’d find it there.

F

or years, we’ve all felt it. Life 
seems to be getting more 
and more expensive. And 

for years — for 
most of us — 
complaining 
about low pay, 
car 
payments 

and 
rising 

housing 
costs 

seemed to be 
the solution.

Then boom.
Earlier 
this 

year, Ann Arbor 
was ranked the 
eighth-most 
economically 
segregated city 
in the nation. We’re definitely a cul-
ture and a generation that loves our 
news in rankings and list form. And 
sure enough, this news went viral.

Now I appreciate any wake-up 

call, Buzzfeed-style or otherwise. 
But simply being ranked eighth-
worst doesn’t tell the full story. 
What does economic segregation 
really mean in Ann Arbor?

A desirable city attracts people 

who can choose to live anywhere. 
And people who can choose to live 
anywhere make a city even more 
desirable. At first glance, it’s a nice 
problem to have. But it’s also a cycle 
that has a lot of unintended conse-
quences — consequences dispro-
portionately felt by those who don’t 
have the luxury of choice.

In any city, there’s always visible 

poverty. We’re quite aware of the fact 
that there are residents who live on 
our streets. Unfortunately, it’s usu-
ally an awareness measured only in 
spare change. But it’s the economic 
hardship that we don’t see, the hard-
ship faced by neighbors and cowork-
ers, that’s the most pervasive and 
toxic to a healthy community.

Since 1979, the top 10 percent of 

Ann Arbor incomes have jumped 
almost 19 percent. That’s mean-

ingful economic growth that you 
can be proud of. But that growth 
is matched by a staggering drop in 
income for the bottom 10 percent 
of our community — a drop of more 
than 14 percent. I have a hard time 
being proud of growth if it isn’t felt 
by my neighbor. And neighbors 
aren’t feeling that growth. In fact, 
they’re feeling the opposite.

There’s a timeless maxim that 

says work is the greatest form of 
welfare. But not all work is cre-
ated equal, and that inequality is 
felt by many people. Prior to taxes, 
a couple both working minimum-
wage jobs, with two kids, would 
need to spend about 44 percent of 
their annual combined income on 
a one-bedroom apartment in Ann 
Arbor. If they wanted to give their 
kids a separate room to share, that 
number jumps to about 58 percent, 
nearly double what the federal gov-
ernment defines as remotely afford-
able. That doesn’t really leave room 
in the budget for a car, let alone 
food. For the wage-earner — the 
person who waits our tables, serves 
our coffee or cleans our classrooms 
— life in Ann Arbor seems increas-
ingly impossible.

But while those numbers are 

alarming, the story is more com-
plicated than the richest and the 
poorest. As the gap between the 
top and bottom of income grows, 
so too does the size of its middle. In 
Ann Arbor, the starting salary of a 
public school teacher before taxes 
is just over $38,000 — still only 
half the median income of the city. 
To live in that same one-bedroom 
apartment, a new teacher would 
need to spend nearly 40 percent 
of his or her annual salary on rent 
alone. Professionals who once lived 
comfortably in communities are 
being pushed out. Clearly, there is 
a “Missing Middle” in the housing 
market.

As of now, Ann Arbor’s solution to 

rising costs and increasing inequal-
ity is to export people to Ypsilanti. 
Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti may only 
be 10 miles apart, but our neighbor 
can feel a world away. With average 
rental rates hanging about $200 per 
month lower than equivalent units 
in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti has become 
our affordable housing option.

As of now, Ann Arbor’s solution 

to the 10 miles separating our two 
communities has been expanded 
public transit. I believe public tran-
sit to be a public good — one wor-
thy of investment. But this isn’t a 
sustainable solution. It’s a bandage 
on a wound that’s bleeding human 
capital, draining our community of 
economic opportunity and disman-
tling our inclusive character.

The solution has to be holistic. 

It has to take wage and transit and 
housing into account. It has to be 
thoughtful in design and decisive in 
implementation.

This is a crisis affecting every 

city across the country. As we 
graduate, look for work and decide 
where we settle, it’s a crisis that 
will affect each of us.

Ann Arbor City Council has 

pledged to do its part by creat-
ing 2,800 new units of affordable 
housing in the next 20 years. This 
can’t be lip service. This goal has to 
be matched with clear resolve and 
opportunities taken.

It’s a complex issue that has to 

be approached very intentionally. 
But we can tackle that in my next 
column. For now, simply put, if you 
work in a community or serve a 
community, you deserve the oppor-
tunity to live in that community.

Unfortunately for many, that 

opportunity is fading.

FILM REVIEW

ABC

“You used to call me on my cell phone.”
No redemption 
for ‘Wicked City’

New ABC drama 
negates feminist 
progress on TV

By SHIR AVINADAV 

For The Daily

Ed Westwick broke “Gos-

sip Girl” ’s fans hearts as Upper 
East Side playboy, Chuck, and 
does it again 
in 
ABC’s 

new thriller, 
“Wicked 
City” 
as 

suave serial 
killer 
Kent. 

Like Chuck, 
Kent has a 
troubled past 
and takes it 
out on women. However, Kent’s 
vendetta against women is a little 
more extreme. Set in 1980s Los 
Angeles, “Wicked City” follows 
the troubled young killer who 
uses his charm (a familiar char-
acter trait of Westwick’s) to lure 
unsuspecting victims into his 
twisted killing routine.

Within the first few minutes, 

he sways two women into hand-
ing over their phone numbers. 
One, a young naïve journalist 
(not cliché at all) who was lucky 
to elude Kent’s plans for her, 
becomes essential in identifying 
the unknown serial killer relent-
lessly pursued by investigator 
Jack Roth (Jeremy Sisto, “Law 
and Order”). The less fortunate 
young woman gets her 15 seconds 
of fame as Kent’s first victim of 
the season. After being led back 
to his car under the guise of an 
innocent hookup (this is the ‘80s 
after all), she is brutally stabbed 
to death. Though the premise of 
the show was obvious prior to 
watching the pilot, seeing this 
unnamed girl repeatedly stabbed, 
her blood splattered on the car’s 
dashboard, while engaged in a 

sexual act, was appalling.

Perhaps what was truly shock-

ing was the fact that it’s 2015, and 
such a horrifying act of violence 
committed against a woman was 
shown on network television as 
entertainment. And victim num-
ber one was just one of many girls 
whose roles on the pilot equated 
to that of a tissue – used and dis-
posed of quickly and without a 
second thought. 

Aside from the tired plotlines 

and melodramatic tone recycled 
from every other crime series on 
television, the show is just plain 
offensive. Competing investiga-
tors Jack and Paco (Gabriel Luna, 
“Bernie”), who are (big surprise) 
forced to work on Kent’s case 
together, conclude that Kent’s 
targeting of women is the prod-
uct of “mommy issues” and call 
it a day. Top notch investigative 
work! With Kent’s inner psyche 
thoroughly analyzed we can con-
tinue watching him justifiably 
victimize the female population 
of Los Angeles with a newfound 
sympathy for his actions.

How could this have been the 

angle “Wicked City” ’s writers 
chose to take? Humanizing a psy-
chotic murderer is one thing, but 
profiling him in a way intended 
to shift the blame onto women 
is wrong and completely absurd. 
The show isn’t the first to explore 
the mind of a serial killer to drive 
the narrative down a twisted 
and dark path that satisfies audi-
ences’ bizarre obsession with 
glamorizing crime. But, it does 
so by exploiting some question-
able subjects – the least of which 
include sex and drugs.

The attempt to humanize Kent 

takes an even more bizarre turn 
when he lets his guard down 
for almost-victim, Betty (Erika 
Christensen, 
“Parenthood”), 

a single mom (like Kent’s own 
mother) who also has a tenden-
cy towards sadism. Her cold-
blooded proclivity is revealed 

in a less graphic manner than 
Kent’s when she plays with a spi-
der and then crushes it with her 
bare hands. Their relationship 
escalates quickly, and strangely 
at that. Kent makes her pretend 
like she’s dead when they have 
sex for the first time, and then 
almost completely dismisses her 
when she has to cancel on their 
date because of work. Of course 
she makes the logical decision 
and blows off her demanding job 
as a nurse to salvage her budding 
relationship with Kent. She goes 
to meet him at the predetermined 
location of their date only to find 
him leaving with another girl. 
He then whispers something in 
Betty’s ear, and we are left guess-
ing at what could have possibly 
convinced her to go along with 
him and the unsuspecting girl, 
with wickedly grin on her face. 
And just like that, the killer nec-
rophilic couple is formed. 

Kent doesn’t seem to be the 

only character exempt of soci-
ety’s 
moral 
standards. 
The 

supposed hero of the pilot’s 
awkwardly strung together plot-
line, Jack Roth, is sleeping with 
his coworker Dianne (Karolina 
Wydra, “True Blood”), whom 
he appears to be using for a one-
sided trade of information to help 
solve his cases. Of course Paco has 
to deprecatingly comment on the 
fact that she’s a stripper, only to 
find out that she’s actually work-
ing undercover at the strip club to 
take down a cocaine dealer. This 
revelation isn’t surprising com-
pared to the discovery that Jack 
is married with kids. Soon after, 
we see Jack using his work as a 
guise for his affair with Dianne. 
This is yet another banal plotline 
– which doesn’t exactly elevate 
the show’s already exhaustive use 
of the plotlines and dialogue typi-
cal of the endless crime shows 
already congesting network pro-
gramming. So, do we really need 
another one?

One-sided ‘Truth’ 
feels too superficial

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

The film “Truth” revisits a 

time in America’s history when 
politics ensnared media in its 
corruption and 
lies. 
“Truth” 

has its saving 
graces 
— 
an 

all-star 
cast 

of Hollywood 
pros 
and 
an 

ultimately 
fascinating 
story. 
Unfortunately, 
it sags under 
the pressure of its disputed 
storyline. 

 
“Truth” 
is 
about 
the 

controversial 2004 news story 
that “60 Minutes” producer 
Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett, 
“Carol”) broke about George 
Bush’s service in the National 
Guard. With the story, Mapes 
asserts that Bush was able 
to avoid service in Vietnam 
through favoritism. She has 

help from her research team, 
played 
by 
Elisabeth 
Moss 

(“Mad Men”), Dennis Quaid 
(“Footloose”) 
and 
Topher 

Grace 
(“American 
Ultra”). 

Considering the potential for 
greatness in these supporting 
actors, particularly Moss as a 
journalism professor, they are 
underused in roles that could 
have added to the character 
relationships had they been 
deeper. The face of the scandal 
is veteran news anchor Dan 
Rathers, skillfully portrayed by 
Robert Redford (“A Walk in the 
Woods”). Skepticism is raised 
when 
Bush’s 
commanding 

officer doubts his service, so 
the entire blogosphere, still 
in its youth in 2004, begins a 
witch-hunt. Mapes stands as 
the main target of the bloggers’ 
wrath, but everyone involved is 
implicated. 

 Firstly, as a director and 

screenwriter, James Vanderbilt 
uses a strange angle to explain 
Mapes’s 
fierce 
journalism. 

While she sleeps on a plane 

back to New York, her team 
discusses her past. They justify 
her tenacity with her abusive 
father, who would beat her 
and her siblings for asking 
questions. 
Unfortunately, 

the 
shocked 
response 
over 

her journalism career feels 
manufactured and awkward. 
When Mapes discusses the 
abuse with her husband, she 
equates the media’s persecution 
of herself to her father’s abuse. 
It’s an odd association, and 
she is already portrayed as the 
victim in this story, so it feels 
like too much to put another 
degree of victimhood onto her 
character. 

 Despite this, Blanchett and 

Redford do an admirable job of 
creating compelling characters. 

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

In some respects, a movie 

about a famous psychologi-
cal study writes itself. Experi-
ments like 
the 
Stan-

ford Prison 
Experiment 
(the 
basis 

of 
a 
film 

that 
was 

released 
earlier 
this 
year) 

are inherently cinematic, with 
thrilling sequences of tension 
and violence rooted in real 
human psychology. In drama-
tizing these studies, filmmakers 
can do a better job of explaining 
their implications, beyond just 
reading their Wikipedia summa-
ries. With deeper research, the 
films can create a more visceral 
reaction in the viewer. A movie 
based on true events needs to 
do more than just recount what 
happened. That’s where “Exper-
imenter” falls apart.

Directed 
and 
written 
by 

Michael Almereyda (“Hamlet”), 
“Experimenter” is the latest film 
to attempt the dramatization of 
a psychological study. Stanley 
Milgram, played here by Peter 
Sarsgaard (“Shattered Glass”), 
conducts 
an 
experiment 
in 

which the participants believe 
they’re delivering increasingly 
painful 
electric 
shocks 
to 

other participants. The study 
intended to examine the effects 
of punishment on learning. In 
reality, the designated “learner” 
(Jim 
Gaffigan, 
“The 
Jim 

Gaffigan Show”) is an actor in 
on the experiment, not actually 
being shocked; the study is 
meant to observe how far the 

subjects are willing to comply to 
continue delivering shocks.

Viewers who know anything 

about the study won’t be sur-
prised to learn that the subjects 
are disturbingly willing to shock 
the learner. The actors playing 
the subjects, like John Leguiza-
mo (“Chef”), Taryn Manning 
(“Orange is the New Black”) and 
Anton Yelchin (“Star Trek”), 
portray their characters in a way 
that presents the full spectrum 
of human reactions to Milgram’s 
seemingly sadistic commands. 
Most subjects begin to wince or 
clench their fists as the shocks 
become more and more pain-
ful, but they continue to obey 
the experimenter even when the 
learner begs them to stop.

The first half of the film plays 

out like a History Channel spe-
cial, with Sarsgaard often break-
ing the fourth wall to explain 
the psychological concepts at 
play. “Experimenter” would be 
a decent movie if it was willing 
to stay focused on the study and 
keep the scenes at Yale. But to 
reach greatness, an experiment-
based film needs to have a pur-
pose beyond reenactment. There 
needs to be an emotional core 
— something that justifies the 
film’s existence. Unfortunately, 
after a kinetic first half explor-
ing the shock experiment’s sig-
nificance, the second half of 
“Experimenter” devolves into 
disconnected scenes devoid of 
narrative drive.

“Experimenter” makes the 

mistake of attempting to portray 
new dimensions by slowly trans-
forming into a biopic of Stanley 
Milgram. Sarsgaard, as always, 
is great in the role, and Winona 
Ryder (“Beetlejuice”) lends a 
warm, curious presence as his 
wife. Still, the film struggles to 

justify Sasha Milgram’s necessity 
as a character in the film. After 
they get married, she mostly sits 
back and watches Stanley work, 
at most helping him sort papers 
or cheering him on.

Ultimately, this story doesn’t 

belong to Sasha Milgram, or 
sociologist 
Paul 
Hollander 

(Edoardo Ballerini, “The Sopra-
nos”), or the numerous other 
minor characters who either 
challenge or support Stanley 
Milgram along the way. “Exper-
imenter” passes these support-
ing characters off as important 
in Stanley Milgram’s life, but 
the first act of the film presents 
the study as the protagonist, not 
Milgram himself.

As a result, once the experi-

ment is over, the film feels 
inconsequential. There’s no par-
ticular grounded story left to tell 
besides a slightly comic, meta 
subplot in which Milgram’s 
study is made into a television 
film starring William Shatner 
(Kellan Lutz, “Twilight”). The 
last two acts do explore the con-
troversy around the study and 
Milgram’s subsequent rise to 
infamy, but these stories pro-
ceed exactly how you’d imagine: 
with detractors criticizing Mil-
gram’s ethics and Milgram defi-
antly dismissing them.

The most compelling scenes 

in the second half are simple 
episodes 
explaining 
related 

psychological studies, like the 
small-world 
experiment 
that 

spawned “six degrees of separa-
tion.” Even these brief interludes 
though are barely connected to 
any overarching plot or purpose. 
The film is worth watching for 
its profound depictions of Mil-
gram’s experiments, but as a 
biopic about Milgram himself, it 
barely leaves an impression.

“Truth” accomplishes what it 
does because of their acting 
finesse, as Blanchett’s every 
movement and facial expression 
is perfect for her role. Redford, 
at 79 years old, is still a force to 
be reckoned with onscreen, as 
he sincerely portrays Rathers’s 
nuanced character.

 Ironically, the screenplay 

— based on Mapes’s memoir 
detailing the events leading up 
to her end in TV journalism 
in 2004 — has been charged 
with not telling the whole 
truth. The network for “60 
Minutes,” CBS, refuses to run 
ads for the show, and “Truth” 

has received criticism for its 
conspiracy theories about the 
media’s influence on the Bush 
administration’s public policy. 
“Truth” seems to want to 
answer the questions America 
still has, but when we walk out 
of the theater, we’re still left in 
the dark.

It’s not you, it’s your 
‘problematic fave’

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Honestly, we were all fine 

with Jennifer Lawrence until 
she made a rape joke.

OK, maybe not all of us. But 

that was the first time I had 
seen such an uproar on the 
Internet about this infamously 
GIF-ready, 
cool-girl-epitome 

celebrity. BuzzFeed reported in 
May that a “Vulture” reporter at 
the Cannes Film Festival party 
overheard Jennifer Lawrence 
say “I broke out my rape scream 
for you!” to Alfonso Cuarón to 
describe how excited she was to 
see him. When this story blew up 
on the Internet, some defended 
her, citing past feminist remarks 
as proof that she was OK or char-
acterizing the comment as dumb 
but not offensive, but some were 
outraged that she felt comfort-
able making that joke.

But despite those black-and-

white gut responses, I’d say the 
vast majority of the reactions 
that I saw on the web consisted 
of people just chalking it up to 
JLaw joining an ever growing 
list of “problematic faves,” and 
this is what intrigued me — 
especially now, only a few weeks 
after she has been commended 
for speaking out against pay 
inequality in Hollywood.

The term “problematic fave” 

(sometimes spelled “fav”) feels 
like it has been ubiquitous for a 
couple years now, and it seems 
like everyone is using it in more 
or less the same way: to describe 
a person in the public eye who, 
despite being lovable in some 
ways (“fave”) also holds or 
expresses controversial opinions 
or behaviors — “problematic.”

Some of the first examples of 

popular problematic faves that 
come to mind (other than Jen-
nifer Lawrence) are Lena Dun-
ham, Azealia Banks and John 
Green. Dunham gets credit for 
bringing women’s stories to TV 
in a big way — but loses points 
for whitewashing New York City 
and not being inclusive (and also 
for some of the more question-
able things she writes about in 

her book). Banks calls out guys 
on their misogynistic music, 
but at the same time has used 
and not apologized for her using 
a very derogatory gay slur on 
more than one occasion. Green 
is interesting because people 
who care about Young Adult lit-
erature usually have very strong 
opinions about him — he’s either 
adored or abhorred. He’s one of 
the most popular and prolific 
writers of our generation, but he 
has been accused of being prob-
lematic for writing female char-
acters who fall into the Manic 
Pixie Dream Girl trope. 

These are just a few, but the 

list goes on — Amy Poehler, 
Trevor Noah, Taylor Swift, 
Jerry Louis, Iggy Azalea, etc. 
And sometimes, people who 
start off as faves become prob-
lematic faves and then just 
problematic. Take Miley Cyrus. 
A few years ago she was a cham-
pion for women owning their 
sexuality and breaking out of 
the mold. But now, it seems that 
every time the camera is back 
on her, she’s saying something 
inappropriate — like calling 
Snoop Dogg her “real Mammy” 
during a VMA sketch.

Even the term “problem-

atic” itself bears scrutinizing. 
Sometimes it’s used to sig-
nify something as insensitive, 
uncomfortable, 
non-inclusive 

or obviously biased. But it has 
also 
become 
an 
occasional 

stand-in for more condemna-
tory words, like racist, sexist 
or homophobic. This discrep-
ancy invites the question: Does 
using the term problematic fave 
mean we’re accepting that peo-
ple can’t be perfect? Or does it 
mean that we’re excusing inap-
propriate, insensitive or even 
unacceptable behavior?

And who gets to decide?
It’s worth noting that all of 

the people I listed as problem-
atic faves are entertainers in 
some form or another. These are 
all individuals who have an open 
relationship with the American 
public — fans and haters, alike. 
Whether they think of them-
selves as role models for their 

fans or not, they still rely on 
the public for their continued 
success, as we rely on them for 
entertainment. It’s a symbiotic 
relationship; their constituen-
cies have given them a responsi-
bility, whether they want or are 
equipped for it or not.

I’m 
not 
saying 
it 
isn’t 

complicated — it is. I’m still 
unsure of the best way to deal 
with these past difficulties. For 
example, Trevor Noah has been 
painted with the problematic 
brush for tweets that he posted 
from 2011 and 2012. While 
some of them are gross, are we 
supposed to assume he can’t 
change? Despite having similar 
definitions 
for 
problematic 

fav, everyone seems to have a 
different opinion on how far 
back we are allowed to pull 
for evidence that someone is 
problematic 
when 
analyzing 

their place in society.

To 
be 
more 
optimistic, 

maybe the use of problematic 
indicates a positive trend in 
society. If people who are 
uncomfortable calling someone 
out as racist or sexist or 
homophobic — or legitimately 
can’t see an action or remark 
as indicative as being one of 
those things — then their use 
of the term problematic could 
be an introduction to opening 
up conversation. At least they 
recognize that something is 
wrong. And this is especially 
useful when we’re talking about 
our own personal problematic 
faves: grandparents, neighbors, 
parents 
of 
the 
kids 
we 

babysit, professors, university 
presidents, roommates, etc.

I think that the widespread 

use of “problematic fave” sig-
nals that yes, we accept that 
people can’t be perfect and they 
can produce interesting or qual-
ity art while not being paragons 
of intersectional social justice. 
But at the same time, calling 
someone a problematic fave is 
acknowledging that we have 
given them a platform — and 
we’re holding them to certain 
standards when they’re speak-
ing from it.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Falling in love 
with T-Swift’s 
‘Fearless’

By SELENA AGUILERA

Daily Arts Writer

Contrary to popular belief, I 

wasn’t always this cool – I mean, 
at least if you think someone who 
listens to music older than they 
are and wears “hipster” glasses 
with band shirts everyday is cool. 
You would never be able to guess 
that my first favorite album ever 
was … Fearless by Taylor Swift. 
That’s right, I was totally down 
with the T-Swizzle when I was 
10 years old. She was my savior 
and for some unknown reason, 
my dumb 10-year-old feelings – 
whatever those were – would be 
nurtured whenever I popped that 
CD into my purple radio.

I wish I could tell you that my 

actual first favorite was some-
thing from Green Day or Led 
Zeppelin or The Temptations – 
anything other than an album by 
the sweetheart of country pop – 
but I can’t. Fearless was the first 
album I spent my own money on, 
it was the first album art I taped 
on my wall and it was the first 
album I knew every word to. Oh, 
the nostalgia.

For some reason, I grew up 

around girls who matured faster 
than I did. They all started to look 
13 early, and I just started looking 
13 when I turned 16. The curse of 
a young face is awful until you’re 
30, probably. But, anyway, my 
friends got the attention from 
every boy I had a crush on and 
I would go unnoticed. My little 
pre-mature heart couldn’t handle 
it, and Taylor Swift was the only 

one I could empathize with.

I remember specifically when 

I had a crush on my friend Avery. 
He was the heartthrob of fifth 
grade. We were the best of friends, 
but he liked Andriana because 
she was the first girl in my class 
to wear a bra. Every boy loved her. 
She wore bows in her hair and her 
mom even let her wear mascara. 
Then there was me, with my dino-
saur shirts and ugly glasses. I had 
never personally identified with 
a song more than when I listened 
to “You Belong with Me,” because 
Andie wore “high heels” and I 
wore “T-shirts.” I thought I was 
the only girl to know Avery – like 
really know him – and Andie just 
wanted him because she wanted 
to make everyone else jealous. 
How rude. Like, didn’t she know 
me and Avery were in love?

Avery and I were in the prime 

of our relationship. We had just 
confessed that we “like liked” 
each other when Andie decided 
she absolutely had to have him, so 
“Forever and Always” became my 
favorite song. My heart exploded 
when I heard Swift sing, “This 
thing is breaking down we almost 
never speak / I don’t feel wel-
come anymore.” It was like Swift 
understood what a 10-year-old 
heartbreak felt like.

Every song on Fearless like 

“Hey Stephen,” “Breathe” and 
“White Horse” spoke in volumes 
about childish unrequited love, 
and I couldn’t get enough of it. 
So, now you know my secret. 
Let’s keep it between you and 
me, OK?

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

In 1979, a group of college 

students from Michigan State 
University visited a cabin in the 
woods. 
What 
happened 
next 
changed 
the horror 
genre 
forever 
with 
the 
1981 

classic, 
“The Evil 
Dead.” Made on a shoe-string 
budget, “Evil Dead” catapulted 
star 
Bruce 
Campbell 
(“Burn 

Notice”) and director Sam Raimi 
(“Spiderman”) into the spotlight 
and has since been cited by no less 
than Stephen King as one of the 
defining horror films of all time.

Over 30 years later, series hero 

Ash Williams and the creative 
team that brought him to life 
return in “Ash vs. Evil Dead.” The 
Starz original series continues 
the 
story 
of 
the 
franchise, 

ignoring 
the 
well-meaning 

but unfulfilling 2013 remake 
directed by Fede Alvarez (“From 
Dusk Till Dawn: The Series”).

It’s 
difficult 
to 
express 

the sheer joy in seeing Raimi 
come back to the franchise, 
bringing with him the gleefully 
cartoonish sensibility for which 
he is known. The key to the 
show’s success, however, lies 
with 
Bruce 
Campbell, 
who 

combines old-school coolness 
with 
slapstick 
humor, 
but 

keeping just enough madness to 
make the whole thing scary.

The story picks up three 

decades after “Army of Darkness,” 
with 
Ash 
reading 
from 
the 

“Necronomicon Ex Mortis” after 
a night of smoking pot and fooling 
around. Ash’s carefree attitude 
with the series’ iconic Book of 
the Dead is one of the few weak 
points of the pilot. As funny as it 
is to imagine Ash doing something 
so thickheaded as use the Book of 
the Dead to impress a woman, it’s 

surprising that he wouldn’t be a 
little more careful after the tome 
murdered all of his friends and 
ruined his life.

The series doesn’t do much to 

fill in newcomers to the franchise 
— then again, if you haven’t seen 
the “Evil Dead” films, maybe you 
deserve to be confused.

As much as the series has to do 

with the franchise’s past, Raimi 
and team still find a way to tell a 
fresh story with some new faces. 
Ray Santiago (“Dexter”) co-stars 
as Pablo, Ash’s friend at the elec-
tronics store where he works, 
while newcomer Dana DeLoren-
zo stars as fellow store employee 
Kelly Maxwell who can more 

than hold her own against Ash’s 
old-fashioned bravado. Also star-
ring is Jill Marie Jones (“Sleepy 
Hollow”) as a disgraced Michigan 
State Trooper whose early scene 
involving the death of her partner 
at the hands of Deadites provides 
the episode with one of its more 
frightening sequences.

“Ash vs. Evil Dead” feels like 

an anomaly — a show so unabash-
edly old-school in its sensibilities, 
yet so interesting in its poten-
tial. To have the same creative 
team behind the original films in 
charge is an undeniable asset to 
the series, making sure its con-
tent transcends simple fan ser-
vice. Those who are unfamiliar 
with the world of “Dead” might 
be turned off by its idiosyncratic 
style and old-school tastes. That 
being said, these qualities are 
precisely what makes the show 
feel so different from the rest of 
the pack. “Ash vs. Evil Dead” is 
delightful; a gory, unfiltered awe-
someness that brings fans back to 
the wonderfully twisted world of 
Deadites, boom-sticks and never 
tiring of hearing Bruce Campbell 
say, “groovy.” 

‘Ash vs. Evil’ is a 
groovy TV sequel

Shared universe 
takes over at CW

TV NOTEBOOK

The CW’s superhero 
series show pros and 
cons of crossovers

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

Next 
January, 
the 
CW 

will 
launch 
“DC’s 
Legends 

of 
Tomorrow,” 
a 
spinoff 

series 
taking 
place 
in 
the 

same 
narrative 
universe 
as 

the channel’s other popular 
superhero shows, “Arrow” and 
“The Flash.” The show will 
feature an Avengers-style team-
up with Ray Palmer (Brandon 
Routh, “Chuck”) and Sara Lance 
(Caity Lotz, “Mad Men”), two 
major 
supporting 
characters 

in earlier seasons of “Arrow.” 
There will also be characters 
from “The Flash,” including 
Martin Stein (Victor Garber, 
“Godspell”), Captain Cold and 
Heat Wave (Wentworth Miller 
and Dominic Purcell, “Prison 
Break”). The problem is this: 
at the start of each existing 
show’s current airing seasons, 
none of these characters were 
in a position where the new 
show’s premise would make 
sense. As a result, the past 
few episodes have slowly been 
moving the pieces around to set 
up “Legends of Tomorrow.”

Setting 
up 
future 
stories 

has 
increasingly 
become 
a 

part of superhero narratives. 
“Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” began 
integrating 
mythology 
about 

the “Inhumans” last season, and 
this will eventually plant the 
seed for a future “Inhumans” 
movie (possibly in 2019, if a new 
writer is found). The movies of 
the Marvel Cinematic Universe, 

too, have included little threads 
to set up future installments, 
like Thor’s disjointed subplot 
in “Avengers: Age of Ultron.” 
In fact, some viewers criticize 
the 
M.C.U.’s 
overreliance 

on serialization in general, 
devoting most of its films to 
tracking Infinity Stones that 
won’t really pay off until the 
third and fourth films are 
released.

The 
CW’s 
franchise-

building 
has 
gained 
some 

criticism, too, and though 
their 
cultural 
reach 
is 

admittedly smaller than that 
of “The Avengers,” “The Flash” 
and “Arrow” can be helpful 
tools in understanding when 
expositional setup works and 
when it feels like nothing more 
than table-setting.

Using the A.V. Club’s episodic 

grades 
and 
corresponding 

comments as a rough indicator 
of critical quality, “The Flash” 
reached its nadir last week with 
“The Fury of Firestorm.” The 
episode’s main plot is devoted 
exclusively 
to 
replacing 
the 

departed Ronnie Raymond with 
a new character to take up the 
Firestorm mantle. Part of this 
feels like a waste of time because 
the cast was announced for 
“Legends of Tomorrow” months 
ago, so viewers already know 

Franz Drameh (“Some Girls”) 
will appear as Jefferson Jackson, 
the new character who will team 
up with Martin Stein and turn 
into a Human Torch-esque hero.

The greater problem, though, 

is the balance of plots. By 
devoting a main plot entirely to 
finding Jefferson Jackson, it’s 
much more obvious that this 
is meant to set up something 
down the road. Meanwhile, the 
far more interesting stories are 
relegated to the background, 
like Iris West’s (Candice Patton, 
“The 
Game”) 
confrontation 

with 
the 
mother 
she 
had 

always thought was dead. Most 
notably, though, this episode 
almost completely ignores the 
momentous return of Harrison 
Wells (Tom Cavanagh, “Ed”), 
last season’s amazing villain. At 
the end of last week, a Wells from 
a parallel universe appeared in 
S.T.A.R. Labs, but this week’s 
episode delays his inevitable 
confrontation 
with 
Barry 

Allen (Grant Gustin, “Glee”) 
until the very last moment. 
Essentially, the problem with 
the procedural isn’t necessarily 
that 
the 
case-of-the-week 

is wholly uninteresting; the 
problem is that the case-of-
the-week 
is 
foregrounded 

instead of the thrilling new plot 

developments.

“Arrow,” 
meanwhile, 
has 

done a much stronger job 
setting up the return of Ray 
Palmer and Sara Lance, both 
of 
whom 
were 
supposedly 

dead at the end of last season. 
In the past few episodes’ 
subplots, Felicity (Emily Bett 
Rickards, 
“Brooklyn”) 
has 

been receiving strange coded 
messages. Ray Palmer, the only 
one who has the ability to send 

these messages, has seemingly 
been 
communicating 
from 

beyond the grave. By confining 
this table-setting to small 
chunks of time, it feels like a 
slow-burning add-on — not a 
superfluous bit of setup.

Meanwhile, each episode’s 

B-plot has been dedicated to 
Sara’s resurrection. There are 
a few reasons this story doesn’t 
feel rote. To begin with, the 
desire to bring Sara back to 
life is grounded in character 
motivations; 
Laurel 
(Katie 

Cassidy, 
“Supernatural”) 

understandably 
wishes 
her 

sister was still alive, so when 
she finds out that there’s a 
“Lazarus pit” that can bring 
her back, she pursues the 
possibility. “Arrow” also makes 
the smart choice to destroy the 
Lazarus pit once Sara is back, 
so that’s one avenue that can 
no longer be used for cheap 

resurrection on the part of the 
writers.

Lastly, 
Sara’s 
symptoms 

upon resurrection — she’s an 
incoherent, animalistic beast, 
no longer really herself — 
prevent her return from feeling 
contrived. Really bringing Sara 
back to life isn’t as easy as it 
sounds, and “Arrow” continues 
to wring thrills and emotional 
tension from her situation.

Table-setting doesn’t have 

to feel so mechanical, though 
“The Flash” has occasionally 
descended into that territory. 
This season, though, “Arrow” 
has 
shown 
that 
smart 

writing and a tight focus on 
characterization can make any 
plot movement feel true to the 
story, not just lame setup for 
the next new franchise. Making 
sure each episode succeeds on 
its own is key to introducing 
new stories in an organic way.

THE CW

“No I can’t hear anything, but at least I look flashy. Get it?”

CW’s franchise-

building has 
gained some 
criticism, too.

The greater 

problem, 

though, is the 
balance of plots.

Future stories 
have become a 
part of superhero 

narratives.

Seniors savor first Big Ten 
championship since 1998

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

Senior year is typically full of 

lasts. The last time you’ll pull an 
all-nighter to study. The last time 
you’ll take a walk in the Nichols 
Arboretum. The last time you’ll 
attend a lecture at Rackham 
Auditorium. 

But for some members of the 

Michigan men’s cross country 
team, senior year brought a first. 

It was the first time the 

Wolverines were able to call 
themselves Big Ten champions. 

“A lot of the runners are seniors 

and fifth-year seniors, and they’ve 
never gotten to the top of the 
podium,” said Michigan coach 
Kevin Sullivan. “It’s been such 
a long time since (this program) 
won. This team wanted to win 
and wanted to leave their mark, 
and that’s what they did.”

The last time the fifth-ranked 

Wolverines ran their way to first 
place was in 1998 — Sullivan’s 
final year as a Michigan track 
athlete. 
Previously, 
Sullivan 

won the individual title at the 
Big Ten Championship for three 
consecutive years from 1993 to 
1995 and again in 1997. 

After this season, fifth-year 

seniors Mason Ferlic, August 
Pappas and Nick Posada will 
no longer be NCAA eligible. 
Seniors Alex Moran and Tony 
Smoragiewiecz 
will 
also 
be 

leaving 
the 
team, 
although 

Smoragiewiez will have one more 
year of track and field eligibility. 

The most notable absence on 

the team will be that of Ferlic’s, 
who became a prominent force 
for Michigan after he redshirted 
his sophomore season due to an 
injury. He has led the Wolverines 
for 17 consecutive races and seven 
postseason meets. He’s been 
named a two-time All-American 
and has been awarded Big Ten 
Athlete of the Week six times. 
Not surprisingly, Ferlic has also 
captained the men’s cross country 
team for three years. 

Despite 
his 
achievements, 

Ferlic 
still 
harbors 
some 

dissapointment that he didn’t 

meet his personal goal of an 
individual title. He fell seven 
seconds short of frontrunner Matt 
McClintock from Purdue. 

“I’m sad this is my last 

championship 
season,” 
Ferlic 

said. 
“I’ve 
dreamed 
about 

winning a conference title for my 
team since I was a freshman. Even 
though I didn’t win an individual 
title, as a team we finally won. We 
wanted nothing more than to end 
as Big Ten champions. I think all 
the seniors are satisfied. We can 
close that chapter of our running 
careers.”

Added 
Smoragiewiecz: 

“We went into this race with a 
different mindset today. We went 
in knowing we could win. It was 
ours to win. We could do it. It was 
this confidence that allowed us to 
be champions.”

Winning the 2015 Big Ten 

title ended the longest drought 
without a conference title since 
cross country regained varsity 
status in 1972.

A lot of what the runners 

chalk their confidence up to is 
experience and knowing that a 

pre-determined race plan will 
never work. Both Ferlic and 
junior Ben Flanagan, co-captains, 
preach flexibility to their team. 

“I don’t think there’s been much 

of a difference in my mindset 
about running from year to year,” 
Ferlic said. “You obviously always 
get stronger, faster and more 
mature in your race tactics, but 
I’ve stayed consistent in how I 
approach these races. I come in 
with this confidence that I know 
I’m coming in with the miles and 
experience to do well.”

This level of dedication has 

extended beyond the seniors 
to the underclassmen, who are 
waiting to become the new senior 
class. 

“We’re thankful the seniors 

got this experience,” Flanagan 
said. “Us younger guys are excited 
to send them out on this note. 
Everybody knew what it was 
going to take. Everybody focused 
on our individual goals. And then 
we filled our individual roles. 
Next year we’ll have new roles.”

And together, they filled the 

role of champions.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Mason Ferlic earned a second-place finish in the Big Ten Championships.

Marody enjoying 
fast start for ‘M’

The lifelong 

Michigan fan has 
fit right in for the 

Wolverines

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Cooper Marody didn’t blow 

out the candles on his 10th 
birthday cake in a Chuck E. 
Cheese’s, or even in his own 
home.

Instead, he elected to have his 

birthday party at Yost Ice Arena 
— a choice that, in retrospect, 
seems to have foreshadowed the 
path his hockey career would 
follow.

Now a freshman forward 

for the Michigan hockey team, 
Marody has played every game 
for the Wolverines, tallying 
three goals and four assists. 
His early-season performance 
has catapulted him to first 
on the team in scoring, along 
with fellow freshman forward 
Kyle Connor. The duo is also 
tied ninth nationally among 
freshmen in points per game.

And Marody has shown that 

regardless of class ranking, 
he has ice in his veins and the 
determination of a veteran.

As 
the 
Wolverines 
found 

themselves tied against then-
No. 18 Union on away ice, 
Marody was the one to give 
Michigan its first lead of the 
game by simply hustling to the 
puck off a deflection faster than 
his defender. He finished the 
chance cooly. 

“He’s brought it, I give him 

credit,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “He showed up 
to the first practice like he was 
ready for this. You only get one 
chance to make a good first 
impression, and he’s done that.”

Though Marody is excelling 

for the Wolverines, his path to 
Yost was unconventional and 
riddled with adversity.

The freshman was never a 

highly touted recruit. He was 
cut from his high school varsity 
team as a freshman. And just 
a year ago, he struggled in the 
United States Hockey League 
as a member of the Muskegon 
Lumberjacks.

But 
when 

Marody 
was 

traded to the 
Sioux 
Falls 

Stampede, 
Berenson 
watched 
the kid who 
committed 
to him as a 
17-year-old 
transform into 
a 
different 

player.

Marody finished 11th overall 

in USHL scoring with 58 points, 
49 of which came in the 38 games 
he played with the Stampede. 
As if that wasn’t enough, he 
put an exclamation point on his 
breakout season by leading Sioux 
Falls to the Western Conference 
regular-season title and the 2015 
Clark Cup championship.

And 
while 
Marody 
is 

headlining Michigan’s highest-
scoring line (which has tallied 
17 points), his prior trials and 
tribulations 
have 
kept 
him 

humbled.

“I don’t mind being the 

underdog, and it (has) been like 
that my whole career,” Marody 
said. “I’m just looking to prove 
the people right that always 
believed in me, and Michigan 
always believed in me. That’s 
why I’ve had good success so 
far, because they all believed in 
me and gave me a shot, and I’m 
working hard to earn that.”

Earning 
this 
opportunity 

has been a lifelong dream for 

Marody, who is a Brighton, 
Mich., native. His father, Patrick, 
raised his son as a Wolverine 
fan. His childhood fandom is 
one of the reasons Marody chose 
Yost for a birthday celebration 
over more conventional options 
as a third grader.

Being 
exposed 
to 
the 

Michigan hockey culture for 
such an extended period of time 

fostered 
an 

appreciation 
for 
the 

position he’s 
in. 

“You 

don’t 
really 

know 
what 

to 
expect 

exactly, how 
your 
game 

is going to 
acclimate to 

the college level,” Marody said. 
“But I think I just try to do the 
little things and work hard. … 
I grew up a diehard Michigan 
fan. I think it takes my passion 
to a whole (new) level when I 
put on that jersey, and I think 
that’s propelled me to have such 
a confident start.”

Now, with that confidence, 

Marody is blowing his coaches’ 
and teammates’ expectations 
away — just like those candles 
nine years ago.

Berenson and his staff never 

anticipated 
the 
immediate 

impact Marody is having. They 
recognized the talent was there, 
but they also anticipated that 
the freshman would experience 
some collegiate-level growing 
pains 
— 
a 
prediction 
that 

Marody ensured wouldn’t come 
true.

“He was in shape, he was 

confident,” Berenson said. “He 
has competed hard and he has 
listened. He’s doing all of the 
things that we’re telling our 
team to do. And it’s working.”

Michigan defense 
reflects on errors

Wolverines seek 
improvement after 

recent lapses in 
performance

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

For weeks, the Michigan 

football team’s defense picked 
out the smallest mistakes to fix. 
After back-to-back victories in 
which the Wolverines gave up 
seven points in each, they vowed 
to prevent their opponent from 
scoring at all.

After three straight shutouts, 

they insisted they should not 
give up even a first down.

The last two games have 

brought 
the 
inevitable 
fall 

from that high, as Michigan 
has allowed 53 points after 
surrendering just 14 in its 
previous five wins. Where the 
Wolverines previously tried to 
make small tweaks, they now 
have big plays to avoid. That has 
been the emphasis in the film 
room this week.

“We just gotta finish,” said 

redshirt freshman safety Jabrill 
Peppers. “We gotta make plays. 
We had too many almost plays. I 
almost had a pick-six. Dymonte 
almost had a pick. I almost took 
the punt to the house. I’m just 
tired of almost. We just have to 
do it. That’s all it comes down 
to.”

But Michigan had perspective 

during its dominant weeks, 
and it has perspective now. In 
keeping with the adage of never 
getting too high or too low, the 
Wolverines know their miscues 
Saturday were outliers. Correct 
them Saturday against Rutgers, 

and they could return to their 
old form.

In a broader scope, mistakes 

notwithstanding, 
Michigan’s 

performance Saturday was not a 
disaster. While 
26 points was 
the 
defense’s 

highest 
total 

allowed 
this 

season 
— 

excluding 
27 
against 

Michigan 
State, 
when 

the 
Spartans 

scored 
on 

special 
teams 

during the final play — they dug 
in when it counted and gave 
themselves a chance to win.

“We’re not worried about it,” 

said fifth-year senior linebacker 
Desmond Morgan. “We’re still 
confident in who we have, what 
we’re capable of.”

To get back to that level, the 

Wolverines will return to the 
film to correct issues that seem 
more obvious now than in a 
30-point shutout. Their start 
Saturday was not ideal, as seven 
of Minnesota’s first eight drives 
moved into Michigan territory 
and five ended with points.

Those 
numbers 
won’t 
be 

lost on Michigan’s coaches this 
week.

“I don’t know why we didn’t 

come out how we were supposed 
to come out, but I can say it will 
not happen again,” Peppers said. 
“We got (criticism) in the film 
room, a lot of guys in particular.

“One 
thing 
about 
these 

coaches, they’re going to coach 
you hard and they’re going to 
be honest with you. They let 
everyone else tell you how good 
you are. They’re going to give 
you the real.”

Another problem, in senior 

linebacker James Ross’ eyes, 
was missed assignments. The 
Wolverines gave up eight plays 
of 20 or more yards. On the 

last 
series, 

Minnesota 
tight 
end 

Drew 
Wolitarsky 
snuck 
past 

the secondary 
for a 22-yard 
completion to 
just inside the 
one-yard line. 
Earlier in the 
second 
half, 

Golden Gophers running back 
Shannon Brooks leaked out on 
a wheel route and picked up 40 
yards.

“It’s been us giving up plays 

and not teams earning them,” 
Ross said. “It’s one thing if they 
earned it, but we gave up a lot of 
plays.”

Added Morgan: “It’s hard to 

say exactly what it was. In terms 
of motivation, I don’t think that 
was lacking. In terms of energy, I 
would say we were fresh. I don’t 
know if the focus wasn’t there. I 
know we were ready to play. It’s 
just that we didn’t come out and 
play the way we all expected us 
to play.”

For 
Michigan, 
that 
has 

become a difficult standard to 
follow. After all, the Wolverines 
could only get worse after three 
straight shutouts. Now they 
have room for improvement 
again, and they intend to use it. 
They have the blueprint from 
earlier in the season, and they 
know just how to get back there.

“You just gotta make plays, 

man,” Peppers said. “That’s it. 
That’s what it comes down to. 
Make plays.”

Carry fairy helps Johnson 
during recent resurgence

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Editor

With four experienced running 

backs who have started games on 
its roster and far less experience 
in the passing game, the Michigan 
football team was expected to 
lean heavily on its rushing attack 
this season.

For much of the season, that 

strategy 
has 
worked. 
After 

struggling against Utah to begin 
the 
season, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

rushing outputs have been as 
consistent as they have been 
helpful: 225 yards against Oregon 
State, 254 yards against UNLV, 
254 yards against Brigham Young, 
198 against Maryland and 201 
against Northwestern. Michigan 
averaged a cool 5.05 yards per 
carry in that stretch.

But against Michigan State 

and Minnesota, the Wolverines 
showed flashes of the ineptitude 
they had displayed in previous 
seasons, missing holes, failing 
to break runs into the secondary 
and, most importantly, combining 
for just 189 yards in the two games 
and just 3.5 yards per carry.

“When we do our stuff right, 

it works,” said redshirt junior 
running back Drake Johnson. 
“When we do things that we’re 
not coached to do, we don’t block 
who we’re supposed to block, we 
taper off.”

The tapering off is a problem, 

but suddenly, depth has become 
a larger one for the backs. Junior 
Ty Isaac is no longer on the depth 
chart due to what Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh called an “internal 
matter,” 
and 
junior 
De’Veon 

Smith is still getting evaluated 
after leaving the game against 
Minnesota on Saturday.

With freshman Karan Higdon 

receiving single-digit carries and 
Derrick Green struggling to the 
tune of just 3.4 yards per rushing 
attempt, that leaves only Johnson 

to carry the load.

Yes, Johnson, the same player 

who has torn his anterior cruciate 
ligament twice and has yet to 
carry a heavy load since.

Despite limited action against 

Nortwhestern and missing the 
Michigan State game due to 
an unspecified injury, Johnson 
showed capabilities of leading the 
backs at Minneapolis, gaining 55 
yards on 10 carries.

“Sometimes, I would say the 

carry fairy allows people to run 
well, and it just happened to 
sprinkle a little dust on me that 
day,” Johnson said.

Due to a successful back-by-

committee start, Johnson has 
yet to carry the ball more than 13 
times in a game but said Tuesday 
that he’s recovered and ready if 
the team needs him.

“That’s not for me to determine, 

that’s up to the coaches, and 
they’ve been doing well so far,” 
Johnson said. “They’ve been 
game-planning 
incredibly 

well, and however I fit into the 
gameplan, wherever they say I 

should be is what I’m going to do.

“If that’s five carries, if that’s 35 

carries and I’m decrepit the next 
day, that’s what needs to be done 
that game to win the game.”

With a thin backfield, odds 

are high that the carry fairy will 
sprinkle dust on Johnson against 
Rutgers, but Michigan continues 
to push for a back-by-committee.

In 
practice, 
Johnson 
said 

carries are split relatively evenly, 
with no one receiving preferential 
treatment. Even if he had become 
the 
feature 
back, 
Johnson 

wouldn’t know.

“Do I have an issue with it? 

No. Are there challenges to it? 
No. Does everyone want to be the 
feature back? Of course,” he said. 
“Idealistically, everyone wants to 
be the person who gets 30 carries 
a game but in a real situation 
that’s not probably what’s going to 
happen.

“It’s not the University of 

Drake Johnson or the University 
of De’Veon or Ty. The University 
of Michigan is the entire team, so 
it’s doing what helps the team.”

Drake Johnson gained 55 yards on 10 carries in Michigan’s game against Minnesota on Saturday night.

“(When choosing universities) I was talking to 

someone and they said you can make a big school small 
but you can’t make a small school big. My other college 
option was a really small school, and when looking at 
it that way, Michigan has so many cool things that I 

thought it would be good to come and get involved in a 

community instead of getting lost in a big school.”

O

h, and another thing:

There’s a pile, and it’s 

made up of all the bad. And 

the pile grows and infects like can-
cer, which is, according to scien-
tists, also bad news bears. (Are you 
on my side yet?)

And the pile comes from any-

where:

She sighed. I did too, hoping, 

half-expecting to hear, “Sorry 
things have been weird this past 
week. Wanna swap saliva?”

But no saliva swap, not even a 

wet nipple fondle. Just “Have a nice 
break,” and away she drove. That 
night, we split up.

Into the pile.
Later, I stood in front of my mir-

ror and winked both eyes at the 
same time. One was red. Was I get-
ting pinkeye again? I’d had it three 
times that week. (Into the pile.)

I was depressed. I knew I was 

depressed because my shirt was 
untucked. I watched The Simpsons 
and tried to remember to laugh. 
When Homer did something, I 
went like, “Heh-heh.”

Two days later, we played Michi-

gan State. And I know everything’s 
already been said about everything 
about everything, but dammit this 
is my column and I’m gonna talk 
about it! Weeeeeee!

Here’s what I remember:
From those moments before, 

when, for once, the Earth revolved 
at our own pace; to those moments 
after, we felt something slip 
through our fingers, felt the parties 
and the stomach pumps and those 
inevitable, hellish orgies evaporate 
into what-nows, into sad bagel din-
ners at home with your unopened 
Swiffer Sweeper and a red solo 
cup of recently expired milk. (Just 
me?)

We 
were 
Alderaan, 
were 

100,000 voices crying out in terror 
and suddenly going silent.

(The Pile. The Pile. The Pile.)
And I cared too much — about 

this game, about that week-long 
quasi-relationship, about the size 
of my Adam’s Apple (my neck looks 
like a snake swallowing a foot).

Why can’t I care about some-

thing important? Like Sudan! Or 
even South Sudan!

But the pile isn’t polite. It doesn’t 

knock first. It bursts in, dropkicks 

your crotch and forgets to call your 
Mom. Loves, losses, suspiciously 
small ears? Depression doesn’t 
make sense, and it doesn’t take 
orders. It’s a real prick. (Just like 
Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir. 
Asshat.)

Twenty minutes later, still fro-

zen in the stands, my friend Cath-
erine turned to me.

Catherine: “What now?”
Me: “Now ... we rebuild.”
So we did.
We walked to Fleetwood Diner 

where we stared at our reflections 
and examined our consciences. 
Catherine asked, “Do you feel any-
thing yet?”

“Not since Thursday, no.” I ate 

my ham in one bite and pretended 
not to choke a little.

At 9 p.m., we went to our friend 

Clare’s apartment, where we vent-
ed to Finnegan, her pet pig.

“Oh, Finnegan,” I said. “Some-

times, I feel like you: Small. Pink. 
Constantly peeing. Never sure 
if I’m allowed in the bedroom.” 
Finnegan nodded and bid me rub 
his tum-tum.

Feeling nihilistic, I downloaded 

Tinder and matched with a lady 
named Cleotilde who asked me 
to text her my “favorite position, 
cutie.”

I answered: “Shortstop.”
Finnegan snorted and bur-

rowed his snout in my crotch. “Oh, 
Finnegan! You naughty pig you! 
You make me feel wanted.”

At 10:52 p.m., we laughed about 

something. I can’t remember what, 
but it was probably something I 
said. Yeah.

At 11:30 p.m., we called an Uber 

(Can you relate now, heathens!) to 
take us to the State for a midnight 
showing of “They Live” (which, I 
know, makes me sound “refined” 
and “nifty.” To that, I say: Thanks, 
dude. I also have a picture of Tom 
Hanks on my fridge. Change your 
bermudas, ladies).

Never seen “They Live”? Know 

this: it’s the greatest 80s movie 
about a drifter finding a pair of sun-
glasses that show him the world is 
taken over and run by undercover 
aliens since “Flashdance.”

(Disclaimer: 
Never 
seen 

“Flashdance,” but I have seen that 
one part where the water goes 

Woooosh-sploooosh-splash 
on 

Jennifer Beals’s boobies.)

I watched, laughed, forgot his-

tory, and walked Catherine home. 
Then walked myself home.

In Kerrytown, a girl in paja-

mas stood outside and yelled at an 
imaginary man ... or maybe I just 
couldn’t see him behind the tree? 
Nah. Imaginary. I missed the lock 
with my key, decided to put that in 
this column and, once inside, part-
ed my hair the other way because 
life is too short not to know. (I sort 
of looked like Jennifer Beals. Or 
Lincoln Chafee.)

I sat on my sweet-ass, fucking 

awesome red couch and remem-
bered all that’d happened, all I’d 
forgotten: My pile.

My hair, humor, body, jaw. My 

thoughts, motives, malice, fears, 
farts, dreams, doubts, posters, 
penis, writing, wrists, sweaters, 
saliva, nose, knees, voice, and the 
way I say, “Chic(aw)go.” That split, 
that loss, this baby raccoon – Wait, 
what are you doing! Get out of here, 
you! Varmint! Shoo! Shoo!

We cope with our pile, with our 

nuggets of pain. And it is painful. 
And there’s no reason for it, no 
secret to being so, so not there. But 
in our best moments, we behold our 
own pile and say, “This is my bad-
ness and my rot and I am proud. So 
suck it.”

At 3 a.m., I cocooned myself 

in my ex-girlfriend’s blanket and, 
nearly smiling, fell asleep.

It’s my pile.

My Cultural Currency: Hair

M

y hair is high mainte-
nance.

Despite 
what 
my 

previous columns might imply 
— ahem, weddings — it’s the only 
thing, really, that’s high mainte-
nance about me.

It started when I was born on 

Oct. 18, 1996, and I’m not saying 
this for dramatic effect.

As soon as my mom saw me, she 

had my dad rush out to get hair clips 
so that she could see my face clearly 
instead of just a giant black mop on 
a tiny human body. In every picture 
I have from the day I was born, my 
scalp is adorned in tiny butterfly 
clips.

So I guess you could say my hair 

has been a huge, divisive issue for 
my family and me since day one.

I have a lot of hair. My mom has 

a lot of hair. All of my aunts, grand-
mothers, female cousins, and my 
sister have a thick mane of jet black, 
shiny hair. It’s both an advantage 
and disadvantage of being Indi-
an. I never have to tease my hair 
to “volumize” a damn ponytail, 
but, on the other hand, it requires 
industrial strength hair clips and 
ties to keep it in place.

When I was younger, my mom 

would slather every strand of my 
hair in coconut oil religiously every 
two days. The cobalt blue Para-
chute bottle was an institution in 
the Madhani household for most of 
my formative years.

“It keeps your hair neat,” she 

said as she massaged my scalp with 
a force so vigorous that my neck 
would start to cramp. “You’ll thank 
me later when you’re 30 years old 
and your hair still looks the same.”

But a 6-year-old doesn’t under-

stand the concept of turning 30 and 
neither does a 13-year-old, which is 
the age I decided to stop allowing 
my mother to oil my hair. She had 
cycled the five stages of grief over 

the course of a week before excom-
municating me for another.

Like I said, hair is a Big Deal for 

my family and me.

Monday/Denial: “What are you 

talking about you’re not letting me 
put Parachute in your hair? Go get 
the bottle right now.”

Tuesday/Anger: “There’s no way 

you’re not oiling your hair today. I’ll 
drag you by your ponytail if I have 
to.”

Wednesday/Bargaining: 
“OK 

look, you can oil your hair only 
once a week from now on.”

Thursday/Depression: “Oh my 

god, Tanya your hair is not going to 
look good when you’re older. Why 
would you do this to me?”

Friday/Acceptance: 
Unfortu-

nately, this particular step does 
not exist for Indian parents. Or, at 
least, definitely not mine. My dad is 
still low-key hoping I do a 180 and 
switch to pre-med. (I know you’re 

reading this, Papa, and you know 
it’s true.)

My decision to forgo coconut oil 

was misguided teenage rebellion 
— I was a good girl, so that was the 
extent of my “acting out”— and I 
quickly saw my hair deplete in both 
its mass and quality.

But, as all teenagers are wont to 

do, I refused to accept my mistake 
and continued to avoid putting 
coconut oil in my hair, like an idiot, 
which is another way teenagers are 
inclined to behave.

I just turned 19 a few weeks ago 

and the prospect of turning 30 isn’t 
so impossible or abstract anymore. 
Ever since I’ve started college, the 
stress has managed to make my 
hair fall out in clumps continuous-
ly. My roommates and I frequently 
find hair stuck on every imaginable 
surface of our apartment.

We’re all hair oil defectors and 

we’re all paying the price.

Faces of an invisible identity:

First-generation student experiences

G

rowing up on the west side of Detroit, most of Katie 
Thomas’ high school classmates didn’t go to college. 
But the Kinesiology senior was a stellar student: she 

consistently earned As in her classes, and she enjoyed going to 
school. So when she applied to college, the University of Michi-
gan seemed like a natural choice.

But Thomas didn’t expect to feel so out of place at the Uni-

versity.

“I knew that coming here was going to be hard,” she said. 

“But it was really hard. I didn’t make any friends until sopho-
more year. I was here by myself and didn’t have any friends.”

Thomas is a first-generation college student. Neither of her 

parents went to college, and Thomas says this identity has had 
a huge impact on her experience at the University.

“If you have parents who went to college, you have some 

idea of what to expect,” she said. “I wasn’t aware. Everything I 
came to here was new to me.”

According to the 2015 enrollment report, about 8.6 percent 

of current freshman are first-generation college students. This 
represents a decline of freshman from about 13 percent in 2010 
and about 11 percent in 2014.

These are the children of food service workers, farmers, 

mailmen, and electricians. Many are from Michigan, but some 
travel from distant corners of the country. Many are working-
class and low-income, according to experts interviewed for 
this article, but first-generation students can also come from 
higher income families.

First-generation students cross boundaries of race, class, 

sexuality, and economics. These are their stories.

***

Thomas went to a charter high school in Dearborn, Mich., 

near her neighborhood in Detroit. Only one-third of her class-
mates went to college, she said — but she estimated that half of 
them have since dropped out. In high school, she studied hard, 
but good grades came easily to her. In college, it was different.

“I didn’t understand what hard meant,” she said. “Hard to 

me was an exam that was tough, not that you have an exam, a 

paper and a project all due within 24 hours. It was physically 
hard, having to keep up on all of the work, but also mentally 
hard. I was here all by myself, no friends, no family, and I had 
to try and do it on my own.”

Most of her friends growing up didn’t even see college as an 

option, Thomas said .

“A lot of people I went to school with thought more about 

the quickest way to get money,” she said. “They thought that 
college was just a distraction, and they could make money by 
working at one of the plants, or somewhere else. They’d rather 
get their six-week license to be a CNA (certified nursing assis-
tant) instead of actually going to school to get a degree and be 
a nurse.”

Public Policy graduate student Cortney Sanders shares 

many of the same experiences as Thomas. A Black woman 
from a working-class, low-income neighborhood in Houston, 
Texas, Sanders was valedictorian of her high school class and 
went on to the UT Austin for her bachelor’s degree.

“I think that’s the journey for most first-gens,” she said. 

“They come from a neighborhood that’s poverty-stricken, 
and the high school is filled with people who come from low 
income or disadvantaged backgrounds, and they are valedic-
torian, salutatorian, top five percent because of the neighbor-
hood they came from.”

Sanders says she grew up in a safe and friendly neighbor-

hood, but she doesn’t remember any of her friends growing up 
actually attending college. Attending a university even a few 
hours away was something unprecedented for her family.

She received a full-ride scholarship to attend the UT Aus-

tin through a program that offers scholarships to low-income 
and underrepresented students. Otherwise, attending college 
might have been unaffordable.

“Some people have different ideas about college,” she said. 

“They think it’s a rip-off, or you’re going to be spending your 
entire life paying it off. It really depends on what people’s par-
ents told them.”

Though only one of Sanders’ sisters attended a four-year 

college, her parents were adamant that she and her siblings 
pursue at least some form of higher education. Thomas said 
her parents are huge proponents of education, too — they 
wanted their kids to have better lives. Her parents emphasized 
academics above everything else.

“They didn’t require us to do a lot of chores and stuff at home 

because they wanted to make sure that we stayed focused on 
the main goals: school and academics as well as extracurricu-
lars,” Thomas said. “As long as we did well in school, that was 
the main focus.”

Sanders said her identities as a Black woman and a first-gen-

eration student are very intertwined.

“In my family, I’m three generations away from slavery,” she 

said. “Generations of my family did not have the option to go to 
college. Someone else who could be literally sitting next to me 
in class never had that experience. It’s not just about the choice 
that was made, but the system that was created for me and my 
personal identities.”

Thomas is biracial. She’s from an area that’s predominantly 

Black, so being in a place with so many white people was very 
different for her.

“Coming here, where the percentage of African-American 

people is fairly small, was different to me,” she said. “I wasn’t 
used to being around so many white people, which is kind of 
crazy.”

Thomas is president of First Generation College Students at 

Michigan — a group she says has helped her feel welcome at 
the University.

The group began with a few students in 2008 and has since 

grown to include a variety of social activities, resources, and 
events. They host weekly meetings, dinners every semester, 
and a special graduation ceremony in May.

Sociology lecturer Dwight Lang is one of two advisers of the 

group. The other is Greg Merrit, a senior associate director for 
housing. Both were first-generation college students, too. Lang 
said these students face a certain set of challenges, but they 
often share common strengths.

“They were the cream of the crop at their high school,” he 

said. “I think one of their biggest struggles is learning how to 
ask for help, because they have been self-sustaining for most 
of high school.”

Lang said being first-gen at the University, especially if a 

student is also low-income, can be a challenge because stu-
dents are generally put in an environment completely differ-
ent from their hometown.

“They are changing, while the rest of their families are 

oftentimes staying in the lower class,” he said. “You’re going 
back and forth for the rest of my life. I’ve experienced that, 
because I was also the first in my family to go to college. I felt 
like I was always going back and forth between my old world 
and my new world.”

Lang added that because the first-generation identity is 

often closely tied to being low-income, this makes the identity 
different than, say, racial identities.

“If you’re working class, you’re going to become middle 

class when you come here and you graduate,” he said. “If 
you’re Black, you’re going to be Black until the day you die.”

Students of color have access to resources like the Trotter 

Multicultural Center and the Office of Multicultural Student 
Affairs. But before the First Generation Students at Michigan 
group was founded in 2008, there wasn’t a place on campus for 
white first-gens.

“Based on the research I read, many first-gen students end 

up being loners because they feel so detached on campuses 
like this,” he said. “I’ve talked to so many first-gens who’ve 
seriously thought about leaving even into their sophomore 
year, because they felt so out of place.”

Lang also emphasized that the first-generation identity 

can transcend boundaries of race, class and more. Some high-
income students are the first in their families to go to college, 
and some low-income students are continuing-generation stu-
dents, a term describing students whose parents graduated 
from college.

Take Logan Meyer, a School of Information junior and vice 

president of First Generation College Students at Michigan. 
Though he’s a first-generation student, he comes from a well-
off family, which has complicated this identity.

“When people are talking about stressors I would never 

experience, it’s hard to consider the issues I’m having,” he 
said. “I almost shouldn’t be in this space. Do my problems even 
compare to those who don’t have the privileges I have?”

Meyer’s mother works for their rural Illinois county, and 

his father is an electrician. They also partially own a family 
farming business, and while they aren’t wealthy, they have 
never struggled with money. Meyer said his first-gen identity 

is often overlooked.

“I struggled a lot my first year, especially academically,” he 

said. “I hated it. I felt alone. I came here with no one. No one 
reached out to me, because I looked like every other continu-
ing-gen student.”

Meyer’s parents pay for his college tuition, but he said 

doesn’t mean they understood what he was going through. He 
said there was a huge disconnect between him and his par-
ents, and between him and his friends from home, too. No one 
understood why he was going to an out-of-state school. Most 
of his high school classmates thought it was a waste of money.

Thomas and Meyer both said being a part of the student 

group has helped them realize that there are other people 
going through similar experiences.

“I realized, I’m not the only one here who feels this way,” 

Thomas said. “Going to the meetings and realizing that there 
are other people who are also struggling and have the same 
issues and concerns as me was also an eye opener. And that’s 
why I started to feel like I had a place and I belonged.”

Thomas is proud to be a first-generation college student. It’s 

something with which she identifies very strongly.

“We set trends,” she said. “We are trailblazers. I am a leader 

and I will be a leader of my family for generations to come, and 
I don’t think that’s anything that should be looked down upon 
or seen as a barrier.”

Statistics on first-generation students at the University 

come from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program 
entering student survey. It’s a national survey of new full-time 
undergraduate students that’s administered by the Univer-
sity’s office of student life. Generally, 75 to 80 percent of new 
students take the survey. Numbers of first generation fresh-
men have shifted over the past few years but generally hover 
around 10 percent.

At other top schools, numbers are similar, or higher. At 

Princeton, 12 percent of students are first-generation college 
students. At Yale, it’s 14 percent, and 17 percent at Brown. 
Among the lowest is Washington University at St. Louis, with 
only 8 percent first-generation students.

Sandra Levitsky, an assistant professor of sociology, is cur-

rently leading an effort to aggregate results of several differ-
ent research studies on first-generation students. Levitsky said 
first-gen students at the University face particular challenges 
because there are so few of them.

“If you go to a community college the numbers will be 60, 

70, 80 percent first generation students, you don’t have that 
sense of isolation because there are a huge number of people 
going through the same experience as you are,” she said. “But 

when you arrive at an elite university like Michigan, most peo-
ple aren’t experiencing this sort of trauma of upward mobility. 
You feel like you are the only one. That sense of isolation makes 
the experience of college much more difficult.”

For example, the percentage of first-generation students at 

the University pales in comparison to nearby Eastern Michi-
gan University: in fall 2011, 33 percent of new first year stu-
dents were the first in their families to attend college.

Levitsky became interested in studying first-gens because 

her dad was one. Growing up, he talked about his college expe-
rience a lot. As a professor, she mentors many first-gen stu-
dents. She said the challenges that these students encounter 
are unique.

“All of these challenges make the experience of being here 

very isolating, very challenging, and very demoralizing,” she 
said. “And so you see a higher dropout rate, or a just sort of 
a really hard experience for four years, sometimes five years, 
where other students are, you know, this is the best time of 
their life.”

Levitsky emphasized that first-generation students have a 

lot of unique qualities. They might not have the cultural capi-
tal of a continuing generation student, but, she said, they tend 
to be hard-working and persistent, and they oftentimes have 
overcome a lot to be where they are.

“If a student arrives at a top research university such as the 

University of Michigan, coming as the first in their family to 
go to a four-year college, they have a certain level of grit, skills, 
persistence usually equated with future leaders,” she said. 
“These are great students.”

In September 2015, University President Mark Schlissel 

announced a new initiative to increase diversity on campus. 
He described ongoing programs to address inclusion and 
diversity, and programs that will be put in place over the next 
year to reach out to students with incomplete applications 
and do more outreach to students who are admitted but not 
yet enrolled. These initiatives also target students from low-
socioeconomic backgrounds.

Levitsky hopes to use results of the project to propose pro-

grams for first-generation students that may be piloted in the 
sociology department. As the University becomes increasingly 
diverse, she says, these programs will become more and more 
necessary.

“One of the things I find so striking is that in a University 

like Michigan, even though we know this about the obstacles 
that first gen students face, we still throw everyone together in 
the classroom and into the program as if they were starting at 
an equal starting line,” she said.

“We know that students who are first-gen students enter 

college less prepared,” she added. “We know that students are 
often unfamiliar with the culture and the mechanics of col-
lege life and they don’t have family members who they can 
call and ask questions. And we know that they tend to have 
more complex family structures and that pulls their attention 
and their time away from their work.”

***

Sanders didn’t begin identifying as a first-generation stu-

dent until she arrived at the University in September, but she 
knows that it has always affected her.

Sanders said being at the University has been different 

than undergrad because her cohort for her Master’s in Pub-
lic Policy program is so much smaller — about 100 students 
per class. She knows her classmates more than she did at the 
UT Austin. But she said overall, the experience has been less 
welcoming. For example, when she made an announcement 
in class one day about an upcoming first-gen meeting, no one 
seemed to care.

“People would have side conversations with me about it, 

and some people would ‘come out’ about them being first-gen, 
but at the moment, it felt like dead silence,” she said. “It was 
more like, ‘Oh, poor Cortney.’ ”

Similarly, Rackham student Aubrey Schiavone also didn’t 

identify as first-generation until she got to the University. 
She’s a student in the joint program between English and edu-
cation.

Schiavone got her bachelor’s from Mount Saint Mary’s 

University, a Catholic school in Maryland of just under 2,500 
students, and her master’s degree at Salisbury University, a 
public school also near her hometown of Lanham, Maryland. 
At both schools, coming from a working class background was 
pretty normal.

Then, she moved to Ann Arbor.
“It was really hard when I moved here,” she said. “I hated 

Ann Arbor when I first got here. In my eyes, everyone here 
was rich and wealthy and I didn’t trust them. Mostly, I had 
interacted with working class people and middle class peo-
ple.”

Schiavone got more in touch with her first-generation 

identity when she found herself unable to afford basic neces-
sities like rent and required books — she had never felt so out 
of place before. She found the first-generation undergraduate 
student group during her second year, as well as the Rackham 
first-generation group.

“It was helpful to know that there are students like me 

here,” she said. “I was still hard for me to say, I’m first-gen and 
I’m not fitting in here and I’m not experiencing it well.”

Similarly, Sanders was the first one in her family to leave 

Houston to attend college and the first one to go out of state, 
too. Since Sanders began college, two of her cousins and her 
niece have all enrolled, too — and her niece is out of state, at a 
school in Ohio. She thinks that she has played a role in making 
this happen.

“I am a trailblazer,” she said. “I am making lives better 

because, for the first time, I can give tangible evidence to say, 
I graduated from here, given my circumstances.”

***

Schiavone’s dissertation is focused on how being a working 

class and first-generation student affects how students read, 
write, and communicate. She remembers one lecture distinct-
ly that made her think a lot about the subject.

“One day in class, we read this article called Kitchen Tables 

and Rented Rooms,” she said. “It was all about how people do 
reading and writing, literacy that matters, outside of schools, 
and a lot of it was about working class people who were writ-
ing at their kitchen tables, for the jobs or for fun or because 
they were going back to school.”

Schiavone said this was strikingly familiar to her — her 

mother is a secretary, and her father is a mailman. Both of 
them love to read and write in their spare time, but she says 
that their literacy skills aren’t valued because they didn’t go 
to college.

“I was so uncomfortable that we were talking about people 

like me, people like my family,” she said. “There is the assump-
tion that the kind of people we study, the kind of people who 
are working class and poor, aren’t in the room.”

Schiavone is interviewing fifteen first-generation, work-

ing-class undergraduates for her study. She focuses a lot of her 
interviews on their writing and speaking practices.

“How we communicate with other people has a lot to do 

with how we are perceived,” she said. “I have this inkling that 
people who are first-gen and working class write and speak 
a little bit differently than people who aren’t, and they write 
and speak in ways that are very much informed by their back-
grounds and their upbringings.”

However, Schiavone was quick to emphasize that first-gen-

eration students have unique strengths.

“A lot of research done on first-generation students is about 

the difficulties they face,” she said. “But I also want to ask stu-
dents about what their strengths are, and what they are doing 
differently and are celebrating about their experience.”

For example, most of Schiavone’s research participants 

have one or more jobs on and off campus, something often 
seen as a weakness because it takes time away from academ-
ics. But these students are also gaining from such experiences.

“They are having this professional development while they 

are in college that other students aren’t getting,” she said. 
“They’ll say that ‘I work in a cafe, or in an office, and I have to 
learn how to talk to customers and clients.’ This is an impor-
tant skill that your career is going to demand of you after col-
lege.”

Social Work masters student Christina Castillo has a bit 

of a different story. Castillo transferred to the University in 
2013, when she was 28. At the time, her daughter, Miranda, 
was five. Castillo is a single mom.

Castillo is from an impoverished neighborhood in San 

Diego. Her grandparents immigrated from Mexico, and never 
went to school. Her mom didn’t go to college, either.

Castillo went to community college on and off for several 

years and also struggled with domestic violence and men-
tal illness. Her daughter was born in 2007; later on, Castillo 
graduated with her associates degree as a Phi Beta Kappa and 
with highest honors. As her daughter was nearing kindergar-
ten, Castillo found herself on public assistance, and she knew 
that she wanted to give her a better life.

“I was applying to jobs that I hated and didn’t want, and I 

knew there was not going to be a future,” she said. “Mainly, 
the decision was for my kid. I knew I wanted a better life for 
her, and I knew whatever she saw, she would repeat in her life. 
College is important and I wanted her to have that value.”

So in August 2013, Castillo and her daughter got on a train 

that took them from San Diego to Los Angeles, and from Los 
Angeles to Chicago. From Chicago, they took a bus to Ann 
Arbor. It was her first time setting foot in Michigan.

“We came here with two suitcases and that was it,” she 

said. “(We) moved into the apartment and slept in the clothes 
we had. We had no blankets, no nothing.”

Now, she says, Miranda is in second grade and constantly 

tells her that she’s going to go to the University one day, too.

“She was, many times, on campus with me going to class-

es,” Castillo said. “She just got into kindergarten when I start-
ed. It was the hardest thing of my life. I had to take her to my 
classes sometimes because there wasn’t a babysitter. Some-
times teachers, I think, forget that there are students that are 
not young and not single and have other obligations.”

Castillo said the experience has been positive for her 

daughter, too, because the Ann Arbor Public Schools are 
among the best in the state.

Although Castillo’s experience as a single mom affected 

her experience at the University, being a first-generation col-
lege student has, too.

“When I first came here, I honestly felt like the stupidest 

person in the world,” she said. “They would be talking about 
concepts I never heard of. People will say things like, for 

spring break, I went to Brazil, and I’m like, as a first genera-
tion, I’m barely cutting it, eating ramen noodles. You feel like 
you’re getting same education but starting off on a different 
playing level.”

***

Schiavone said the biggest message she wants to send to 

people at the University is that these students need mentors.

“They need mentors who are empathetic, and that can 

advocate for them, and who they can identify with,” she said.

Schiavone said because being a first-generation student is 

an often invisible identity, students and faculty should not be 
afraid to speak up about it. When she finally did, she found 
three mentors who were also first-gen.

“If you’re a professor on campus here, if you’re a grad stu-

dent or undergraduate who is first-gen, start saying it,” Schia-
vone said. “Say it out loud, and celebrate it.”

I 

notice the red holes in my sneakers as I walk into an outlet mall’s T.J. Maxx. Wearing 
a $10 graphic tee purchased on clearance, I wade through aisles of affordable clothing. 
I’m looking for a particular shirt.

I move around the men’s section until I lay eyes on my intended purchase: a blue polo shirt 

with a yellow Ralph Lauren logo embroidered in the top right corner.

I quickly grab the polo, pace toward the fitting room and throw it on. It fits me well. A few 

seconds later, I'm hit with concern.

“You shouldn’t purchase this,” I think. “It’s such an expensive brand. It’s not your style.”
“But it’s $35 here — over 50 percent off,” I respond. “You’ll get a lot of wear out of it at the 

bars. It’s nice quality.”

I override my concerns, head to the cash register and buy the shirt.
While purchasing a Ralph Lauren polo may sound frivolous and trivial, it’s emblematic of 

the difficulties I navigate in transitioning out of being from a lower socioeconomic class. It’s 
a constant war, shaded with difficult emotions to articulate that feel silly to discuss.

If you asked me about purchasing a Ralph Lauren shirt three years ago, I would have 

laughed at you.

I grew up in Ypsilanti, a town with a reputation for being low-income. I lived in a low-

income household. As a child I cringed when handing money over to see a movie with friends. 
When I showered, I looked up and saw clear-looking tarp covering the hole in our roof that 
we couldn’t afford to fix. I became accustomed to poverty — its patterns and rhythms that 
would strike fear and confusion into others if they lived like me.

But that all changed when I came to Michigan. I attend this school on an incredibly large 

need-based scholarship, one that lends itself to covering my rent. Not only is my rent paid, 
but through making financially smart choices like sharing a room with my best friend, I 
pocket some of my student refund each semester.

This money provides me a source of disposable income, and it’s more than I’ve ever had in 

my life. It’s not, say, enough money to buy a car, but coupled with my jobs, I can afford to eat 
out with friends, buy drinks at a bar and make occasional $30 to $50 purchases on clothes I’ll 
wear two to three times a month.

While this feels very American-Dream-Come-True-esque, each step out of poverty leaves 

me feeling weighted, shameful, and guilty.

Take, for example, the blue polo shirt. Even though it was reasonably priced, I felt guilty 

because I purchased it to blend in with other people that wear those shirts — people who are 
financially stable. It’s tough, because when I’m wearing it at a party or bar I look like every-
one else. But that blending feels like I’m lying to myself, to the world around me.

Not only that, but it’s a stark contrast to the core values I held.
I remember during high school when I’d wear whatever I wanted and feel proud of myself.

One day, I wore a polo shirt that looked like it belonged to a safari guide. I got it for a few 

bucks at Plato’s Closet. As I interacted with my friends that day, I got a wide range of respons-
es to the shirt. Some friends thought it looked amazing while others teased me in good spirit.

Regardless of the response, I liked that shirt and didn’t care what others thought.
I compare that to myself now. Looking around at Rick’s one night, I realized how many 

people wore Ralph Lauren polo shirts and I immediately felt self-conscious wearing my plain 
shirt. Instead of reassuring myself that I don’t need to wear what others do, I realized I could 
just go out and buy a polo shirt.

It’s as if the more money I’m given, the more things I can purchase, the more I feel my 

self-confidence slipping through my hands like sand. But I can’t tell if that’s actually what’s 
happening, or if I’m simply developing a rational and logical solution to a problem.

Throughout my life, I’ve gotten the impression that low-socioeconomic status is an iden-

tity I should escape. I need to work hard, attend a good school, graduate, get a high-paying 
job and proceed to live happily ever after. 

And I’d have to agree that escaping poverty is important and beneficial. But, then, why do 

I feel like I’m losing more than just a set of poor circumstances? Even the mundane, day-to-
day activities like wearing a shirt make me feel as if part of my identity, beliefs and lifestyle 
are being ripped from the very core of who I am.

***
I’ve been thinking of how to end this story for the past few weeks. I wanted to leave with 

some sense that I’m meshing the two identities. But it’s just not happening.

I hoped this story would inspire me to wear other shirts, but I still love the Ralph Lauren 

Polo. Some nights I feel that same sense of guilt tugging at my stomach, but other nights I 
look at myself in the mirror and ask why I’m making such a big deal out of a T-shirt.

“Seriously, you’ve had enough of this. It’s a shirt. You like it. You look good in it, you didn’t 

pay much for it. It’s not that big of a deal. You have money now, and you can buy stuff like this. 
It makes you feel confident. Just stop making a big deal out of this,” I constantly tell myself.

But sometimes when I’m walking away from the mirror I see my reflection not as who I am 

in that moment, but as every image that I’ve ever seen myself as in a mirror. They’re smashed 
together into one being while also being individual and fragmented, like every past version 
of myself is present in that glass. In that moment I’m whole yet unbelievably disjointed. And 
I hear in my head — as if one of the old fragments is coming into focus — a whisper.

“I miss who you used to be.”
That whisper is fierce and chilling. It shocks me to my core. I can’t tell whether it’s a voice 

of sincerity and truth, or the voice of a jaded, wildly irrational 16 year old.

But as I walk away, I hear my most current fragment respond.
“I miss you, too.”

I

t won’t take long into getting to know me to know how much I love the rapper Drake. 
He’s in my Twitter bio. He’s the background on my phone. I once changed the all com-
puter screens at The Michigan Daily news desk to mirroring images of his face.

When friends describe me to people they know, they often bring up my obsession with 

Drizzy. It’s become my “niche.” Interestingly, however, no one has ever asked me why I’m 
obsessed with him.

On the surface, it’s easy to understand my infatuation. In music videos when he points his 

chocolate brown eyes at you, framed with long eyelashes and thick, sculpted eyebrows, and 
puckers his full, pink lips … one can’t help getting carried away.

Aside from his godlike beauty, Champagne Papi has earned his top spot among today’s 

most famous pop stars. He’s sold 10 million albums worldwide and has had more singles on 
Billboard than any other rapper. Drake’s got one Grammy, six BET awards, four platinum 
albums, and a thriving record label, OVO Sound.

However, Champagne Papi is far from flawless (barring aesthetics). Following the release 

of Hotline Bling, Drake’s been called out for slut-shaming and being too quick to judge a girl 
as “bad” or “good.”

To be clear, these are critiques I wholeheartedly agree with. Drake does not “own” women 

— if they want stop talking to him and go out with their friends, that is none of his business.

Yet I still have love for The Boy — not for the women he doesn’t like, but for the women 

he does.

Whether it is Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, or Serena Williams, Drake loves his independent 

women — women who make their own money, who have their own names, and do not rely on 
a man for their fame. 

In the song “Fancy,” Drizzy praises his girlfriend for her independence. He says though 

she spends hours getting ready and looking good, she doesn’t “do it for the man, men never 
notice; you just do it for yourself, you the f*cking coldest.” And not only does the girl not care 
about what men have to say about her, she’s got a degree, a house and she’s making her own 
money: “Shout out to the homeowners / the girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan 
us / a little something extra should we ever need it.”

I have always looked up to independent women. During my childhood, I saw many girls, 

the daughters of Pakistani immigrants, with little ambition in their schoolwork or hobbies. 
Though much different now, traditional Pakistani culture had dictated women take on less-
intense career aspirations and focus all their energy into getting married and raising their 
children. And this general lack of ambition in women isn’t singular to children of immigrants 
— when I came to college, I saw women all around me have little drive for success.

Though many would say this is OK, that sometimes pursuing a passion is not for every-

one, I disagree. For women especially — who face the constant pressure of being overlooked 
for jobs and promotions by men in the workplace and still manage to get paid less — I have 
always felt there’s something to prove. Whether it be through getting good grades and find-
ing a job, or being the best athlete, singer, artist, chef, or journalist you can be, I feel women 
have a responsibility to being their best selves.

I am not working hard just because Drake notices, but when I play him on Spotify and he 

croons about loving a “student working weekends in the city” or a girl “tryna study by the 
pool,” I know he notices when a girl’s working hard.

It’s not as if I do these things for Drake — it’s just nice that he notices.
