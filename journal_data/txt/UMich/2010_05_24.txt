CITY ELECTIONS
LSA alum
makes bid
for mayor
Recent graduate seeks
Ann Arbor's highest
public office
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
Less than one month after U.S.
President Barack Obama stressed civil
service in his commencement address,
one University graduate is wasting no
time putting his political science edu-
cation to the test by running for public
office.
Abeut halfway through his senior
year at the University, William Btustic
Jr. started thinking about running for
mayor of Ann Arbor. At 22, the politi-
cal science and Afroamerican and
African Studies major who graduated
on May 1 said he just wants to listen to
and help the people of Ann Arbor - a
place he said feels like home.
"If I can help you, I can help you.
If I can't, I'm going to figure out away
to help you out. That's what I want to
do," Bostic said. "I want to be some-
body who you can come talk to if you
have a problem. I feel that as the
mayor, I can be that voice for people
(who) need a voice."
Bostic said he was inspired to run
for office after he wrote a paper for
one of his political science courses
about enacting a foreclosure morato-
rium.
"The funny thing was I started
seeing (my ideas) in The Huffington
Post ... they were talking about lone
modifications - what I was talking
about in my paper," he said. "I (was)
like, 'Wow, I actually came up with

University as a research faculty
member. One report was adopted
by the Faculty Hearing Commit-

Panel discusses
good leadership

Presidential advisor
shares experience in
workplace authenticity
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily Staff Reporter
In front of a large crowd in Rack-
ham Auditorium on Wednesday
morning, Betsy Myers, chief oper-
ating officer of President Barack
Obama's 2009 campaign, spoke of her
8-year-old daughter's love for dance.
The anecdote, she said, was a meta-
phor for authenticity in the work-
place.
"Profiles in Leadership" - a day-
long discussion with high-profile
panelists - featured Myers, who was
interviewed by Ora Pescovitz, the
University's Executive Vice President
for Medical Affairs and University
Provost Teresa Sullivan. The con-
versations centered on the qualities
that make a good leader, particularly
focusing on women and leadership in
the current economy.
"When you think about being
authentic, are you freaking out with
joy with what you're doing in your
life?" Myers asked.
Though her daughter was given
as an example of authenticity, when
asked to name other leaders who
exemplified the trait, Myers chose
President Obama, stating that she'
felt he did not change who he was for

campaign purposes.
Myers also listed Sarah Paln, who
was the Republican vice presidential
candidate in 2005, as another leader
she felt remained true to her own val-
ues and positions - a trait Myers said
is essential to finding success in any
career field.
As former President Bill Clinton's
former White House senior advisor
on women, Myers said she felt Clin-
ton was successful because he valued
his staff members. She added that a
leader who can appreciate the efforts
of all workers can encourage produc-
tivity in any workplace.
"When we feel valued in our
life, when we feel appreciated and
acknowledged and thanked, that is
when we are motivated to bring our
best self," Myers said.
While Myers said she has enjoyed
working for the two presidents, as well
as her time as executive director of
Harvard's Kennedy School of Govern-
ment Center for Public Leadership, she
said there have been times when she
was not fulfilled by her work.
The problem of being disengaged
is common, Myers said, with 70 per-
cent of people in the workforce who
say they are disinterested in their job.
She said they are the target audience
for her upcomingbook.
For those people, Myers said the
solution is to take risks and explore
other job possibilities. Myers said she
took this risk herself, when she left
the mainly office work of Obama's

Wednesday during the day-long panel discussion titled "Profiles in Leadership."

campaign to advocate for him on the
road.
Despite the fear many people have
of taking chances in the current eco-
nomic situation, Myers said this move
is actually ideal given the changing
job market.
During the panel discussion
entitled, "Leading in Lean Times,"
Stephanie Boyse, president and CEO
of Boyse, Inc., also said she felt that
being a vulnerable leader in business
is one of the greatest and most prof-
itable risks to take. Boyse said, when
forced to close the company's plant in
Adrian, Michigan her open display of
sympathy and emotion was appreci-
ated by the displaced employees.
In the second half of the event, as
she was interviewed by Provost Sulli-
van, Myers spoke about the advance-
ment of women, as they compete for
the same jobs as men.
"What we're seeing with the glass
ceiling is that it's being shattered by
women who are pushing through that
glass ceiling," she said. "But we still

have quite a bit of work to do."
Citing the example of the many
female university presidents, Myers
said she has seen an increase in
women in power across the nation.
In an interview with the Michi-
gan Daily after the event, Becky
Eggleston, a nurse manager in the
University's Health System, said
she enjoyed the discussion and will
take away the fact that she needs to
be willing take more of a risk in the
workplace.
Barb Walters, a business analyst
in the Medical Center Information
Technology department, also said
she learned a lot from the discussion.
She added that though many of the
conversation topics were directed at
women, she felt men could also learn
from the discussions.
"She spoke earlier about a diverse
workforce and I think one of the keys
to successful leaders, both female and
male, is being able to recognize each
others' strengths and understand
each other," Walters said.

Public speakers criticize U' officials

Regents meeting
draws controversial
topics, police officers
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
Police officers from the Univer-
sity's Dearborn campus were on hand
at the Board of Regents meeting on
Thursday, as several individuals spoke
out against the University and its top
administrators.
Topics brought before the regents
in the public comment section of the
meeting - in which pre-registered
members of the public can address
the regents for up to five minutes -
included objections to alleged strong-

arming by the Department of Public
Safety, concerns over the procedures
that govern the DPS Oversight Com-
mittee and commentary on the sup-
posed crumbling of institutional
integrity at the University.
Speaking before the University's
Board of Regents, Doug Smith, a Uni-
versity alum, asked regents and execu-
tive officers to examine a clause in the
policies that govern the DPS Oversight
Committee.
Smith told the regents about chang-
es that were made to the DPS Over-
sight Committee's guiding document
in Fe ry. Specifically, Smith voiced
concer out one change that reas-
signs the grievance spk 'l process.
Prior to the amendments made
in February, the executive director
of DPS could appeal a grievance to

the Board of Regents by taking the
grievance to the University's Execu-
tive Vice President and Chief Finan-
cial Officer, Tim Slottow. Then, if the
Board of Regents accepted the appeal
from the executive director of DPS,
the grievance would be dismissed
before being reviewed by the DPS
Oversight Committee.
However, under the changes made
earlier this year, the executive direc-
tor of DPS now has the option to
appeal grievances to Slottow, who in
turn can have the grievance dismissed
from consideration by the DPS Over-
sight Committee with the permission
of University President Mary Sue
Coleman.
Effectively, the change gives Cole-
man the final say in whether the DPS
Oversight Committee can investigate

a grievance against DPS, not the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents.
Asked in ane-mail why the change
had been made, University spokes-
man Rick Fitzgerald said the change
was meant to bring the policy for the
DPS Oversight Committee in line with
other University policies and proce-
dures.
"The change makes this process
consistent with most of the other cam-
pus appeal processes, like the one for
(the Freedom of Information Act) for
example," Fitzgerald wrote.
However, when speakingbefore the
University's Board of Regents yester-
day, Smith said he thought there was a
different reason for the policy change.
"Not only are the committee mem-
bers sworn to complete secrecy by

REPORTS
From Page 1
According to the Faculty Hearing
Committee's report, the commit-
tee found evidence that University
officials violated Borisov's rights to
personal and academic freedom and
intellectual property. Additionally,
the report says the officials broke
established University policies sur-
rounding academic integrity, wrong-
fully damaged Borisov's reputation
and retaliated against him.
The reports' findings stem from
an incident in 2008 in which Borisov
was allegedly forced to resign in a
meeting with his department chair
and two University Police officers.
According to a pending lawsuit
Borisov filed against the University,
officials at the University retaliated
against his allegations of scientific
misconduct within his department
by claiming he was not bringing in
enough outside funding to support
his research. Prior to the allega-
tions, Borisov had reported that his
research collaborator had begun
claiming Borisov's work as his own
after receiving tenure and had ille-
gally reduced Borisov's effort on
their grant. This reduction, which
Borisov alleges in the suit was done
illegally, made it appear as though
Borisov was bringing in less money
for his research.
The chair of the Faculty Hearing
Committee confirmed that the com-
mittee accepted the report's findings
last month despite SACUA's vote not
to accept the report.
And while SACUA, the leading fac-
ulty governing body atthe University,
chose not to adopt the report, it did
draft a memo that included aspects
of the report to send to University
Provost Teresa Sullivan.
SACUA President Ed Rothman
told The Michigan Daily he would
not comment on SACUA's letter to
Sullivan because he felt it was a
confidential communication.
"A letter was created and sent off
to the Provost's Office in lieu of the
report," Rothman said. "It takes
the elements of the things that
were agreed upon and sent those
off, and left out those elements
that we didn't agree upon. Beyond
that, I can't tell you because it was
a letter that was from SACUA to
the provost and wasn't addressed
to the general public."
Rothman also said he didn't

believe that formally accepting the
report presented by the Faculty
Hearing Committee - of which he
was a member - would be in the best
interest of current faculty members.
"We all have the same purpose and
that is to make this a better institu-
tion and to protect the faculty who
are here and that purpose was not
well served by taking that report
and sending it to a bunch of people -
that's why it wasn't accepted," Roth-
man said. "You can imagine that if
you're tryingto affect changes so that
other people are protected and treat-
ed properly, having a report released
that presents a narrow view of what
really happened can undermine your
ability to negotiate change."
Referencing ongoing litigation in
the matter, Rothman said, "It isn't
that we didn't accept what was there,
it's that there's a lot that is left out
and by its very omission undermines
what we wanted to say."
"The Provost's office and SACUA
are not in opposite camps on this
issue, we agree," Rothman added.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald declined a request for
comment on behalf of the provost
about the letter from SACUA.
"The Provost has nothing more to
add on this topic," Fitzgerald wrote
in an e-mail.
When comment on the report
endorsed by the Faculty Hearing
Committee was sought, Fitzger-
ald told the Daily that because the
full body of SACUA did not vote to
approve the final draft of the report,
he didn't feel there was basis for
comment.
"There's really no report to com-
ment on," Fitzgerald said.

Fitzgerald also declined to com-
ment on the copy of the report that
was accepted by the University's
chapter of the AAUP.
Sullivan had previously reviewed
a draft of the Faculty Hearing Com-
mittee's report sent to her by then-
SACUA Chair Michael Thouless.
The draft included several recom-
mendations to University adminis-
trators, including that compensation
be awarded to Borisov for economic
damages, efforts be made to rehire
him, the trespass order that bans
Borisov from campus be lifted and
that the Michigan State Police be
called to further investigate the inci-
dent.
The draft also recommended that
appropriate disciplinary measures
be taken against those who allegedly
broke University policies - includ-
ing Valerie Castle, the chair of the
Department of Pediatrics and Com-
municable Diseases where Borisov
worked. Castle was reappointed to
her post as the Ravitz Foundation
Professor of Pediatrics and Com-
municable Diseases last week by the
University's Board of Regents.
After reviewingthe draft, Sullivan
sent a one-page letter back to Thou-
less in which she said that she was
against formalizing the report as it
could be harmful to SACUA and some
tenured members of the faculty.
"As I read the report, I came to
the conclusion that the report would
be damaging to the reputation of
SACUA and potentially (and unfairly)
damaging to the reputation of one or
more tenured faculty members," Sul-
livan wrote in her response letter.
In an interview with the Daily in
March, prior to the formal adoption

by the Faculty Hearing Committee
of the final report, Sullivan said the
report overlooked the other perspec-
tives underlying the issue.
"When this faculty group was
empanelled to begin the investiga-
tion, no litigation had been filed.
Shortly after the panel started its
work, a number of people from the
University were sued," Sullivan said.
"And so, as was completely foresee-
able, counsel said you can't speak
to this faculty panel. So the faculty
panel has heard one side of the story."
Sullivan continued by saying she
believed there was another side to
the story, but that she wouldn't com-
ment on the report.
"The first thing you learn as an
administrator is there's more than
one side to every story, and there
aren't even just two sides to every
story, you know, there are many sides
to every story," Sullivan continued.
"That tends to be true in personnel
situations as well, so both because it's
a personnel situation and because it's.
a litigation situation, I'm not going to
be inclined to talk about it."
However, when responding to fol-
low-up questions from the Daily, Sul-
livan called the report problematic.
"I think inevitably, the report can
talk about what they heard," Sul-
livan said. "As I said, the first thing
you learn as an administrator is that
there is more than one side to every
story so almost by definition when
one side can't speak to you, you're
hearing one side of the story. I think
that's a problem."
In an interview with the Daily
earlier this month, Charles Smith,
the past president of the University's
chapter of the AAUP and a profes-

sor in the University's Pharmacol-
ogy Department, confirmed that the
AAUP's report would be forwarded
to the regional chapter of the AAUP
- which covers all schools in the
state of Michigan and is led by Smith
as its president.
From there, if the regional chap-
ter adopts the report, it could be
forwarded to the national AAUP for
consideration, Smith said. However,
consideration from the national orga-
nization may not be easily gained
given the number of cases they
receive each year.
Smith explained that the national
AAUP typically only takes four to five
cases each year, addingthatthey typ-
ically are cases that can have "enor-
mous impact."
"That does not mean that the
AAUP would not take the Borisov
case because it involved one person
who's not a tenured faculty member,"
Smith said. "If they find that what-
ever happened in that case violates a
principal of the AAUP ... they could
take the Borisov case."
However, Smith explained that
the National AAUP is already aware
of the Borisov case, saying the orga-
nization has been in contact with the
University already.
"I understand that the National
AAUP Committee A staff sent a letter
to the University of Michigan," Smith
said. "They did receive a response
from General Counsel and the gen-
eral counsel said do not do anything,
because SACUA has now created a
faculty hearing committee and you
should wait until the faculty hearing
committee has completed its deliber-
ationsbefore you do anything, before

A right to education
Michigan students deserve more than a temporary fix
Jt seems that the Michigan State Legislature has adopted a new man-
tra: out with the old and in with the new. With the idea of saving the
school district money, Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm recently
signed a law providing tenured teachers incentives to retire, allowing new,
younger teachers commanding lower salaries to take their place. Given the
alternatives, this is the preferable course of action for the state to take. But
with cuts to education becoming as regular as the seasons over the past
decade, legislators must work to guarantee that a solvent, sustainable and
successful public education system a right for Michigan children.

Michigan recently took a strong step
toward protecting our community's
health by making virtually all res-
taurants, bars, workplaces and public
places smoke-free.
The governor signed the measure
into law because it has been demon-
strated, time and again, that smoke-
free policies improve indoor air quality,
protect the health of non-smokers,
reduce emergency hospitalizations for
heart attacks, decrease cigarette con-
sumption, encourage smokers to quit
and change social norms regarding the
acceptability of smoking.
The facts supporting the adoption of
such measures are stark. Worldwide,
the tobacco epidemic killed 100 million
people in the 20th century and is pro-
jected to kill one billion people world-
wide in the 21st.
In the United States, smoking
kills an estimated 443,000 people
each year, with secondhand smoke
responsible for 50,000 of those
deaths, including 1,700 in Michigan.
Approximately 8,600,000 people in
the United States have chronic ill-
nesses related to smoking.
And it's no wonder why. Every bil-
lowofsmoke fromacigarettecontains
hydrogen cyanide, arsenic, benzene
and radioactive polonium 210, as well
as dozens of other carcinogenic, or
cancer-causing, substances. Addi-
tives used by the manufacturers cer-
tainly don't help, but it is the tobacco
itself that is responsible for most of
the cancer-causing and toxic effects
of cigarettes. In other words, using
"organic" or "additive-free" tobacco
doesn't help.
Many people now know that both
smoking and secondhand smoke
exposure cause lung cancer and asth-
ma attacks, but many areunawarethat
secondhand smoke, like direct smok-
ing, also causes heart disease, acute
respiratory infections, ear problems
and sudden infant death syndrome, to
name just a few concerns. They don't
know that tobacco use causes more
deaths than HIV/AIDS, alcohol use,
cocaine use, heroincuse, homicides,
suicides, motor vehicle crashes anad
fires - combined.
When it comes to secondhand
smoke, some people incorrectlybelieve
that openinga window, sittingin a sep-
arate area within the same airspace or
using a fan protects bystanders from
harm. However, a 2006 report by the

U.S. Surgeon General concluded that
there is no risk-free level of expo-
sure. The only genuine protection is
100-percentsmoke-free environments.
With passage of the new smoke-free
law, Michigan has committed itself to
saving lives and protecting its resi-
dents. Additionally, it joins the grow-
ing number of jurisdictions that have
done so. As of the month of March,
24 states, the District of Columbia
and Puerto Rico have enacted simi-
larly comprehensive smoke-free laws.
(An additional 14 states had adopted
less comprehensive smoke-free laws
that cover some venues.) Well over
a dozen countries have also enacted
strong smoke-free laws. Even Ireland
eliminated smoking in all pubs with
overwhelming public support several
years ago.
The right not to be harmed by the
conduct of others is deeply embedded
in our culture and in our laws. By con-
trast, there is no state or federal con-
stitutional right to smoke. As a civil
libertarian, it is my personal belief
that adults should have the right to
make their own, informed decisions
about their personal conduct. That
prerogative does not extend to engag-
ing in activities that place others at
risk against their will, whether they
areour friends, ourfellowworkers, our
children or members of the public.
Most people these days are naturally
concerned about the health impact of
tobacco use, and 70 percent of smokers
report that they want to quit. If you are
one of them, low-cost (or free) assis-
tance is immediately available.You can
start by going to www.smokefree.gov,
calling 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-
8669) or talking to your doctor.
Many years ago, I coordinated the
national campaign for enactment of
the law making all domestic commer-
cial airline flights smoke-free. That
law has been a huge, popular success
for 20 years. Today, one can hardly
imagine having to inhale the smoke
of fellow passengers on a five-hour,
transcontinental flight. I am confident
that implementation of Michigan's
new law will be met with equal sup-
port and appreciation.

Last Friday, the state passed a
bill that provides incentives for

com. Eligible, retiring teach-
ers would receive slightly
increased pension plans, and
those who choose to stay will
receive a three-percent pay cut.
The bill's proponents hope the
retirements will make room
for younger, cheaper educators,
saving the public school systems
up to three billion dollars and
alleviating the stress of their
budget shortfalls.
This bill slaps a Band-Aid on

Apoor standard

SIMON BORST

E-MAIL SIMONATSIMKAL UMICII.EDU.

f you're beginning the pro-
cess of applying to graduate
schools, then you are likely
preparing to take
a standardized
test. For me, it's
the Graduate
Record Exami-
nation, or GRE.
When I began
studying for the
test, the section TOMMASO
I feared was PAVONE
"Quantitative
Reasoning." But
after taking some practice exams,
I found that the math on the GRE
is as basic as many of my friends
had said. So, I thought, the verbal
section will be a breeze - after
all, I've always possessed a fairly
robust and diverse vocabulary.
Two words: fat chance.
I knew I was in trouble when
my parents, who lived in Italy for
35 years, were performing bet-
ter on the practice verbal tests
than I was. To be clear, my dad
still doesn't know the difference
between "live" as in "to live one's
life" and "live" as in "Saturday
Night Live," and my mom isn't
much better. But they know Italian
and their Latin roots, resulting in
several awkward moments when
I would be faced with a seem-
ingly indecipherable word only to
have my parents quickly provide
the Italian translation as if to say,
"Seriously, you didn't know that?"
Perhaps I should brush up on my
Italian to improve my GRE score
- but that seems like a ridiculous
strategy to improve my perfor-
mance on the English section of a
standardized test.
In case you're wondering what
type of vocabulary is tested on
the GRE, the following is a GRE-
esque paragraph explaining how I
feel about the verbal section.
I don't wish to sound cantanker-
ous, much less jejune, and I know
that garrulous decrials of the GRE
are no ersatz for pedantic studying.
Therefore, I shall be laconic in my
a posteriori diatribe. Prima facie,
I had a visceral premonition that I
would perform feebly in the quan-
titative reasoning section while
feeling like a puissant on the verbal
section, which I hoped would bol-
ster my score. Inter alia, there has
been a hypertrophy in my increas-
ingly heterogeneous vocabulary.
Ex post facto, I was mistaken. The
verbal section has enervated my
confidence with its ostentatious, if
not archaic, repertoire of vocabu-
lary. I can only hope that my resil-
ience prevails, my fervid efforts

are vindicated and my frustrations
prove ephemeral.
In other words, the GRE ver-
bal section and I have hit a rough
patch in our three-week old rela-
tionship. But let me be clear about
why I'm ranting in the first place:
the GRE doesn't adequately test
your verbal analysis skills, and
it's a poor example of a "standard-
ized" test.
It's time for
grad schools to
scrap the GRE.
Regarding my first critique, if the
verbal section is primarily a vocab-
ulary test (which it is), then it's test-
ing a person's memorization skills
or knowledge of an increasingly
obsolete vocabulary that's often
unrelated to one's field of study. In
an ideal world, a standardized test
should assess a person's natural
abilities and require no studying
(if this seems unrealistic then you
know why I dislike the concept
of standardized tests in the first
place). But on the GRE, those with
the time and resources to buy and
study GRE prep books, attend GRE
prep classes and make hundreds
of note cards are at a significant
advantage over their peers.
Like many undergraduates, I'm
bitingthe bullet and studying daily
for the GRE. But we should ques-
tion why graduate programs (who
are aware that GRE performance
is not very indicative of success
in graduate school) are making
admissions and financial aid deci-
sions based, at least in part, on a
standardized test score. Sure, it
makes their life easier by provid-
ing a cutoff point for the consid-
eration of applications, but the
focus shouldn't be on what's easy,
it should be on what's right. And
what's right just might be scrap-
ping the GRE altogether.
The GRE is outdated. It's a test
based on the philosophythat a stan-
dardized score can assess the intel-
ligence and merits of an infinitely
complex individual. Thankfully,
graduate schools are beginning to
place less weight on GRE results.
But darn it, after fifteen years of
school, I feel I've earned the right
not to preoccupy myself with one
more standardized test.

Learning to live in the UK

My mom always told me
that first impressions are
really important: "Wrin-
kles and a poor
handshake do
not make a good
impression." And
London - one of
the most amazing
cities in the world
- has extended
its arm and given ERIKA
me a really bad MAYER
handshake.
My family and
I lived in Indonesia for three years
during my preteen years, so I'm no
stranger to extended stays outside
the United States. So after living in
the largest Muslim country in the
world, I expected that adjusting to
London would be a walk in the park.
What I didn't realize is that it's a
lot harder for my family to support
me from across the ocean, and that
makes this English-speaking coun-
try seem very foreign.
Now, don't get me wrong; I'm
not going to give up on London just
yet. I had rocky starts with people
who turned out to be some of my
best friends. But for a city with such
awesome reviews, I've been disap-
pointed with my first encounter.
The first British accent was excit-
ing, even though it was far from the
first one I've heard in my life. I had to
stop myself from being mesmerized
by the grandmotherly woman sit-
ting across the aisle on the plane. But
from there, the enchantment ended.
Heathrow Airport is very confus-
ing, and it has little to offer. Grant-
ed, if I hadn't spent six hours there
waiting for the rest of my group to
land, I might've enjoyed my visit a
bit more. If my first lesson of study

abroad was to avoid total assimila-
tion, the second was to be patient.
But a grumbling stomach - there's
no food in the arrivals terminal -
makes that a little difficult.
Once out of the airport, I was
struck with the startling realization
that London is dirty. Really dirty. In
all my pre-travel excitement, I pic-
tured the city as both a gleaming
metropolis and beacon of culture and
cleanliness to the wide-eyed tourist.
Reality: 1, Erika: 0.
Yes, it was naive of me to create
this mental image. But I can't say
anyone ever prepared me for what it
would actually be like. While the city
is filled with charm and old build-
ings, I'm covered in black smudges
by the end of the day.
After a shower and some food,
however, I started to see the city dif-
ferently. With my clothes put away, a
working blow dryer and a fresh out-
look, things didn't seem so bad any-
more. Pubs spilling over with locals,
music playing: The city had the buzz
I initially expected from London. A
regular party town where you can
drink on the street - what more can
you ask for?
But now, as I write this column
in the middle of the night, I real-
ize how utterly in over my head I
am. Nothing around me is familiar,
and that is made even worse by how
similar things are to home. It's the
little things - like no flat sheet on
the bed - that trip me up. Not to
mention the fact my body clock is
so out of whack that I'm up at 3 a.m.
trying to stave off a panic attack.
The mercurial changes of acclima-
tion are the worst part of adjusting
to my new location.
Lesson three of studying abroad is
that no matter how much I thought

I prepared myself, nothing could
get me ready for the homesickness.
Right now, I just want to go home to
my family and friends. Eight weeks
seems like a ridiculously long time.
We were told all kinds of unimport-
ant information at orientations and
talks before we left, but no one told
me what I'm supposed to do when I
can't even make it through the first
24 hours.
In London,
Reality: 1,
Erika: 0.
Everything here is so similar to
home, but at the same time frustrat-
ingly different. Everyone speaks Eng-
lish, drives the same cars and pretty
much eats the same food. The bath-
rooms are almost the same, but then
figuring out how to work the shower
is harder than taking the LSAT. I can
talk to my family pretty much like I
would at home, but I'm living com-
pletely alone. It's very unsettling.
In all my travels, I have never felt
this way when entering a country.
It's like I skipped the excitementpart
and went straightto the freaking out.
Though things are rough now, it's
only the first day and I'm sure that
things will get better. The program
suggests I immerse myself in the
local culture, but I think a little taste
of home - perhapssome Starbucks -
and a good night's sleep will get me
back on track.

this before some other people ... You
know what? This is what my educa-
tion is teaching me - I have the cre-
dentials, I can do this, why not?"'
With no official campaign plat-
form yet, Bostic said he is waiting to
hear more from the citizens of Ann
Arbor about what issues are impor-
tant to them.
"We need to hear what everybody
has to say first before we can do
anything," he said. "Whatever prob-
lems come to the top we're going to
address. If it's a small problem, we're
going to address it too. I want to hear
every single problem."
There are some issues, however,
that Bostic said he already knows he
will incorporate in his platform - the
mostimportantbeing the city's budget.
"We can't really do anything until
the budget's fixed," he said. "I'm
going to tell people that sacrifices
have to be made and I'll start off by
lowering my salary. If I am elected, I
plan onloweringit to (at most) 35,000
dollars. I believe it's 41,600 (dollars)
right now for the mayor, but I'll take
it down to 35, even 34. That will be my
gesture of good will saying... I'm will-
ing to make a sacrifice."
Bostic said he hopes that by fixing
the budget, he can prevent layoffs to
Ann Arbor's first responders.
Also on Bostic's agenda are reno-
vations to the E. Stadium bridge and
a decision on whether or not to tear
down Argo Dam. Bostic said he is

you intervene in anyway."
The national AAUP's compliance
with the request was normal, Smith
said, because the AAUP prefers that
matters be dealt with at the local level.
Upon learning of the steps being
taken by the AAUP chapters, Roth-
man said he didn't feel such actions
would be appropriate.
"It can only do harm to the people
involved and I think it's really short-
sighted," Rothman said. "I'm sorry to
hear that they are proceeding with
this because it's not the whole story
and it's misleading. I certainly can't
tell them what to do, but I would rec-
ommend against doing that."
Borisov is currently in the process
of making his case in public, having
brought litigation against the Uni-
versity in 2009. The case is currently
awaiting further proceedings in the
Washtenaw County Circuit Court.
The case is currently on hold due
to an extension granted by the court
to Borisov, who is in the process of
finding a new attorney. He was pre-

waiting to take a side on the Argo
Dam issue until he has more informa-
tion on the situation.
"If (the dam) is not generating
electricity, I feel there should be no
need for it, but I'm still not ready
to make that call because I haven't
heard from anybody who uses Argo
pond," he said.
Born in Houston, Bostic said he
lived in Ann Arbor for five years before
moving back down to Texas, where he
spent most of his childhood. Bostic
added that even after settling down in
Stafford, Texas he and his family came
back to Ann Arbor occasionally on the
holidayto visit relatives.
At the University, Bostic was
involved with the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored
People and the Black Undergradu-
ate Law Association. He played var-
sity football but quit after two years
and started working at the Michigan
Telefund.
"I wasn't used to having so much
time on my hands," Bostic said. "I
wanted to work and do things for
myself, so I started working and was
able to buy a car, so I learned what
hard work gets you."
Bostic said he was always planning
to stay in Ann Arbor after graduation.
"Personally, I feel attached to Ann
Arbor - the people here, the students,
the citizens, the residents, everybody
here," he said. "I'm going to try to
stick around up in Michigan because
... this is home."
Before deciding to run for mayor,
Bostic said he was en route to law
school to become a corporate lawyer,
viously represented by Christine
Green, who is now running for the
Michigan House of Representatives.
His suit includes seven counts,
including defamation, interference
of contract, fraud, false imprison-
ment, assault and battery and mali-
cious prosecution. According to
court documents, Borisov seeks
compensation with interest, attor-
ney's fees and other relief as may be
deemed appropriate.
Borisov is not a stranger to battling
the University in court. In April 2009
he was acquitted of criminal charges
brought against him by DPS, which
alleged that Borisov ignored orders
given by officers and attempted to
leave his office with property whose
ownership was in question.
After the acquittal, University
Police spokeswoman Diane Brown
told The Ann Arbor News that DPS
had given Borisov ample opportuni-
ties to avail himself, but that he con-
tinued to intensify the situation.

the Daily to corrections@
michigandailycom.

but he said after doing some research,
he realized he didn't want to be "just
one of the heavy-handed lawyers that
would just do what they had to do for
the company."
Jon Lockard, a lecturer for the
Center for Afroamerican and African
Studies, said Bostic approached him
earlier this year to discuss his future.
"He came to me talking about
advancing his career, about being
helpful to the community, about the
determination to not let political
things affect his growth," Lockard
said. "Frankly I had no idea he was
going to run for mayor, but I did know
he was very interested in helping the
community."
Lockard spoke highly of Bostic's
caring and genuine personality,
describing the young candidate as "a
little bit beyond his years." He also
said he's excited to see a young person
running for office.
"I think it's wonderful when young
people...see themselves as part of the
community and not as on the side of
the community, and I think that's
something that should be celebrat-
ed. Whatever the outcome, I think it
should be celebrated," he said.
"If personality has anything to do
with it," Lockard added, "he's in good
shape."
After deciding to throw his hat
in the ring for mayor, Bostic said he
called Mayor Leonard Scarcella ofhis
hometown of Stafford for some guid-
ance.
Scarcella, who said he knew Bos-
tic when he was in high school and
often watched him play football, said

the administration, but the adminis-
tration has added a new clause that
says that if the police chief objects to
a grievance and the president agrees,
there will be no hearing," Smith said.
"This clause codifies the president's
authority to cover up police miscon-
duct."
Having first-hand experience with
the policy, Smith said he and Andrei
Borisov, a former faculty researcher
at the University, were informed that
a grievance they filed with the DPS
Oversight Committee would not be
considered because Coleman had cho-
sen to reject it.
The grievance alleges misconduct
and violation of DPS policies by DPS
officers who participated in an inci-
dent in which Borisov was allegedly
forced to resign in 2008.
University spokesperson Rick
Fitzgerald said the University would
not comment on the issue because it
involved a matter currently in litiga-
tion.
Another public commentator at last

A University graduate from the class of 2010, William Bostic Jr. recently a
for mayor of the city of Ann Arbor.

he's proud of the young candidate and
thinks Bostic has what it takes to sit
in office.
"I admire him immensely," Scar-
cella said. "He's biting off a huge
chunk to run ... never having any
political experience ... butI have great
admiration for what he's doing. He
seems to be an articulate young man
and has a very nice appearance, and I
think he's a very solid individual and
I just wish him every success."
Scarcella, who was first elected
mayor of Stafford in 1969 at the age of
week's meeting also raised serious
concerns about University policies
and procedures.
Linda Martinson, a former Univer-
sity student, spoke about her struggles
that were caused by a lack of central
policies when she was a student at the
University.
Martinson was a student in the
School of Nursing before her status
at the school was jeopardized and
hearings to determine her status at

And while the topics discussed by
members of the public at last week's
meeting may have been unusually
critical of the Board of Regents and
the University's executive officers,
University spokeswoman Kelly Cun-
ningham told The Michigan Daily
that the presence of police officers
maynot have been unusual.
Responding to a question from the
Daily about whether the officers were
present because of the controver-
sial topics being discussed in public
participation or the fact that one of
the public speakers was barred from
setting foot on the University's Ann
Arbor campus after being expelled,
Cunningham said neither was the
case.
"It had absolutely nothing to do
with any of the speakers," Cunning-
ham said in an interview.
Cunningham instead said that it is
commonpractice forcorporate boards
to have security on hand during pub-
lic meetings. However, Cunningham
wouldn't comment on whether the
University typically takes such mea-
sures for Board of Regents meetings.

FESTIVAL PREVIEW
Detroit's own electronic Movement.

going to envi- Hart Plaza, Detroit
sion a sweaty, $60 for a three-day pass
white "Euro
Rave," action-packed with grinding

club-druggers. Little does the aver-
age American know that not only did
techno music originate in the States,
but that it was a predominantly black,
urban movement, spearheaded right
here in Detroit.
Movement, also known as the
Detroit Electronic Music Festival, is
an annual testament to Detroit's often
overlooked past as the hotbed of tech-
no and electronic music in general.
And, with a 100-artist lineup boast-
ing talent from 13 different countries
(including Germany, Chile, Spain and
Argentina), Movement also showcases
the international spiderweb of splin-
ter genres that the "Detroit Sound"
has spawned over the years.

Since its foundation in 2000, the
festival has erupted into a gargan-
tuan five-stage gala, attracting techno
fanatics from across the globe.
"It's a pilgrimage - it's a Mecca
of this stuff," said Jason Huvaere,
Movement's executive director. "It
is a full-blown 36-hour block of pro-
gramming, plus all the after-parties
spread all over town. It is, without a
question, the single highest concen-
tration of creative individuals that the
city attracts. I mean, we sell out every
hotel in town ... Detroit just lights up
for the weekend. This festival makes
people want to vacation in Detroit."
But unlike the star-studded lineups
of blockbuster indie festivals like Lol-

lapalooza and Bonnaroo, Movement's
lineup is likely to look like Greek to
anyone who isn't a hardcore tech-
head.
"One of the beauties of this festival
is that we're able to showcase music
that people here may not be super
familiar with," Huvaere explained.
"It's not designed, nor was it ever
designed, to be a popular music festi-
val ... Most of the music that we work
with is from artists that have a lot
of momentum in other parts of the
world. And that's what we're trying to
do, is just to keep Detroit up with the
current momentum and the current
pace of the world festival circuit."
While the festival certainly sports

its fair share of local talent and musi-
cians stayingtrue to the funk-and-dis-
co roots of classic Detroit techno and
house music, it also plays host to an
eclectic slew of electronic offshoots --
from breakbeat and jungle to hip hop
and dubstep.
Detroit native Juan Atkins, largely
credited as the pioneer of techno
music along with high school buddies
Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson
(all of whom will be performing at
Movement this weekend), sees the
festival as a showcase of Detroit's
transnational influence coming full
circle.

A gross 'MacGruber'

By BEN VERDI There

Has anyone ever handed you one
of their shoes and said, "You have to
smell this!" even
though you've just

"MacGruber" and Rave
is that putrid shoe Universal
transferred onto
the screen. In all honesty, this film
should make you puke, but - if
you're a true friend to the art of film
- you'll give it a whiff, only to hate
yourself later.
Rarely does a film reach the elusive
"so-bad-it's-good" level of films like
"Snakes on a Plane" and "Highland-
er" (which navigate different paths
to the same end of the spectrum),
but "MacGruber" might be ready to
inherit the throne reserved for the
best horrible movie in existence.
Because of the "Saturday Night
Live" skit that spurred the film,
which stars "SNL" cast members
Will Forte and Kristen Wiig along
with Ryan Phillippe ("Stop-Loss"),
one would expect a lot of "bomb"
metaphors to pop up in any review of
such an atrocious piece of filmmak-
ing. MacGruber, played by Forte, is
essentially a poor man's MacGyver,
whose job it is to defuse bombs to
presumably save the world. But the
bomb metaphor for the film is too
easy and simplistic.

lacing challenges built on various
planets and satellites. Players travel

Throughout, they are fearlessly
thrust into 3-D gravity mayhem, retro
2-D throwbacks and platforming per-
fection.
The sequel's additions to the "Gal-
axy" formula are varied and fresh.
New to the game is the inclusion of
Yoshi, who has somehow managed
to become cuter and cuter since his
debut 20 years ago. Controlling Yoshi
is a blast, largely because he retains
that double-edged Yoshi thrill of the
old Mario games - a sense of power
coupled with great risk. New power-
ups for Mario, including rock and
cloud suits and a nifty drill are all
inspired, exciting flourishes.
Overall, "Galaxy 2" is more stream-
lined, varied and engaging than its
predecessor. Subtle edits to the game-
play yield great results. This time out,
the worlds have fewer challenges each,
meaning there are more of them. Each
manages to be a little bit more varied
than in the last game, too, from grassy
clusters of asteroids to monstrous
labrynthine battleships. In "Super

Mario Bros. 3" style, there's a world
map, along with a simplified base hub,
making navigation a breeze. The story
and preliminary stages waste no time
throwing players into the thrill-ride of
exploring Mario's universe.
And what a universe it is. "Super
Mario Galaxy 2" features what might
be the greatest level design in Nin-
tendo's established history. Every
single stage is a masterclass in art and
game design - a consistent gameplay
rollercoaster with consistently mind-
blowing results. Just when you think
you've experienced all the tricks of
"Galaxy 2," it throws out a handful of
new ones. The graphics are gorgeous-
ly rendered: From the farthest star to
Mario's mustache, "Galaxy 2" makes
the most of the Wii's hardware.
The orchestrated score is wonder-
ful, treating old and new tunes alike
with a heartfelt reverence. There is
so much to love about this game, and
it is clear that a lot of love went into
making it.
The only downside to "Galaxy 2"
is its similarity to its predecessor. But
while retaining much of that game's
form, "Galaxy 2" manages to improve
on it in crucial ways. It's hard even to
imagine where Nintendo can go from
here - single stages in "Galaxy 2"
have more creativity than most devel-
opers' entire games. If you own a Wii,
you should be playing and loving this
title. Heck, if you have ever loved
video games, you need to be explor-
ing this galaxy.

FILM REVIEW
No happy ending for 'Shrek' series*-

Fairytale story can't
hold 'Forever After'
By ANKUR SOHONI
Daily Arts Writer
Most children's franchises throw
out quality in exchange for fleeting
amusement, but you'd think Dream-
Works
would *****
take qual- Shrek Forever After
ity further
into con- At Quality16 and Rave
sideration DreamWorks Animation
for such a
high-grossing series as the "Shrek"
movies. With the fourth installment,
DreamWorks seems to have dropped
the ball. "Shrek Forever After" is a
fun and enjoyable 90 minutes, but
beyond that it feels more like a direct-
to-video sequel than the culmination
of a successful animated film series.
The first "Shrek" came out nine
years ago, and it was a fresh, welcome
sensation, it reached critical acclaim

and it quickly became Dream-
Works Animation's most successful
franchise to date. The story of an
unusual - meaning large, green and
nonhuman - "prince charming" (not
to be confused with the actual Prince
Charming, a bratty character in the
series) is a valuable tale for children
and adults alike, who are all too often
swayed by 20th century, pretty-faced
Disney animation, where the hero
always looks like Prince Charming
himself.
In this fourth theatrical outing,
Shrek (Mike Myers) has settled down
with wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and
triplets Farkle, Fergus and Felicia
into their cozy swamp house. He's
content to pass the days as a family
man, receiving daily visits from best
friend Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and
nodding to the passing tour bus that
points him out as a public attraction.
Shrek becomes wary of the routine,
though, and uncomfortable with his
new softie reputation.
Staying rooted in fairy tales,

"Shrek Forever After" brings in a
classic character to mix things up -
Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn). He
tricks Shrek into making a deal: In
exchange for one day of his life, he
gets to live one more day as a true
ogre, free to roam and terrorize
humans at will.
The jealous Rumpelstiltskin
chooses the most inopportune day -
Shrek's birthday - and takes it away.
And thus commences the "Back to
the Future" existential paradox. How
does Shrek get back to his life if he
was never even born?
On a critical level, "Shrek Forever
After" is like a typical unnecessary
sequel. It returns Shrek to his old
locations and threatens to render
all his previous efforts pointless. It
represents the creators' attempt to
squeeze out one more film without
bothering to progress the story. The
film is a big character arc, and not
much else. Considering the rich-
ness of the personalities and the odd
charm of their world, it's unfortu-

nate that more effort wasn't given to
developing the story as a whole.
On an entertainment level, though,
"Shrek Forever After" has at least a
bit of the original "Shrek" charisma,
even after losingsome of its magic. I

predecessors a popular hit. In true i
DreamWorks fashion, the visual style
is delightfully bright, shiny and real-

many theaters showing the film in
RealD 3-D, the film capitalizes on
what is quickly becoming an anima-
tion standard. The 3-D is actually
rather well done - that is to say, not
especially gimmicky.
There are also a few brilliant
moments scattered throughout the
film, which, not surprisingly, mostly
involve the Murphy-voiced Don-
key. Even in the most uninspiring
moments, his character is adorably
irreverent, and it's a marvel that his
shtick still feels fresh. And the rest

In the 2010 renewal of the NCAA

were required to beat Notre Dame
twice in order to advance in the
64-team tournament.

and 12-2 in the regional final on Sun-

Notre Dame entered the tourna-
ment ranked 25th with an impres-
sive 45-10 record, just one win shy
of Michigan's record. They had four
selections to the All-Great Lakes first
team, which was just two fewer than
Michigan.
But neither coach expected to see a
pair of blowouts.
"To come back and attack Notre
Dame the way we did was just out-
standing," Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins said. "I thought it started
in the circle. (Junior pitcher Jordan
Taylor) attacked them."
The Notre Dame lineup, which
was batting .035 higher than Michi-
gan's lineup coming into the regional,
was no match for Taylor. She struck
out 22 Irish batters in 12 innings of
work, walking only one.
And the Wolverine lineup wasn't
intimidated by Notre Dame pitcher
Jody Valdivia, who got the start in
both games and entered the tourna-
ment with 36 wins and a 1.72 ERA.
"They did a good job of jumping on

said. "I didn't help by putting the

Michigan and Tennessee's fates
were sealed.
The two will face off this upcom-
ing Friday and Saturday in the best-
of-three super regional series, and it
will be held at Alumni Field in Ann
Arbor. Next weekend will mark the
third time Michigan has hosted the
super regional and the first since
2008.
SCOUTING THE ENEMY: If
there's one thing that stands out
when glancing at Tennessee's depth
chart, it's youth.
The team carries 10 freshmen on
its roster, and six underclassmen
start in the Lady Vols' everyday
lineup.
And if there's one deficiency with
Michigan's roster, it's youth - the
everyday lineup consists of five
seniors and no freshmen.
But Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins has yet to decide wheth-
er Tennessee's age is a good or bad
quality.
"I know they're young," Hutchins
said. "But that concerns me as much
as if they're old. They always have
great talent, and they're always
competitive.
"So, you know what, we'll focus
on us, as always."
With the age difference will

They drill the ball into the

ground, bouncing it 25 feet into the
air, and by the time the third base-
man comes up with it, she has no
chance at a play at first.
Once they're on base, they run
wild - Tennessee has -stolen 119
bases this season, dwarfing Michi-
gan's 44.
But that's not to say that the Wol-
verines aren't willing to give their
opponent a taste of its own medi-
cine. They surprised their oppo-
nents in the Ann Arbor regional
by swiping four bases over three
games.
Michigan will also come into
the series with significantly more
power than Tennessee. After seven
home runs in the regional, Michi-
gan has 81 long balls in 2010, com-
pared to Tennessee's 47.

gle-season record with 20 apiece.
MICHIGAN'S PITCHING STRAT-
EGY: Hutchins doesn't appear to
have a strict pitching strategy thus
far in the postseason.
She's only revealed that she'll
give the start to whoever gives the
Wolverines the best shot at win-
ning.
And as of now, that means that
junior pitcher Jordan Taylor will
probably get the start in tougher
games.
Senior pitcher Nikki Nemitz got
the nod for the regional opener
against lowly Wright State, and
Taylor was tapped for both starts
against Notre Dame.
In 2005, during Michigan's
championship run, Jennie Ritter
started every game of the tour-
nament. So don't be surprised if
Hutchins goes with Taylor from
here-on-out.
And if Nemitz does get the start,
expect Taylor to enter at the first
sign of trouble.

'M' season ended by
Lady Vols in Sweet 16

Every story has an ending, but
the Michigan women's tennis
team's record season, unfortunate-

After dominating athome during
the first two rounds of the NCAA

Wolverines traveled to Georgia for
the Sweet 16.
But that would be as far as the
team would get, after facing No.
14 Tennessee. Michigan (24-5)
fell, 4-0, on Thursday to the Lady
Volunteers, effectively ending the
Wolverines' winningest season in
program history.

Bernstein said. "We feltpretty good

out."
However, the third-year coach
didn't want to take anything away
from Tennessee (19-8) and its per-
formance.
"Clearly we did not play our best,
but some of it was Tennessee, too,"
Bernstein said.
Michigan struggled in doubles
right out of the gate - an area that
has generally been a strength all
season. Tennessee's No. 1 doubles
m team of Caitlin Whoriskey and
Natalie Pluskota defeated the Wol-
verines' top tandem of 19th-ranked
juniors Rika Tatsuno and Whitney
Taney.
The doubles point was then
clinched in dramatic fashion in the
number-two spot thanks to a 9-8

Tennessee win in the eight-game
pro set. The Volunteers won the
tiebreaker 12-10.
Bernstein and her team were
unhappy with the results, but con-
sidering the Wolverines only had
one senior, they know that such a
season can be a stepping stone to
greater success.
"This doesn't take away from our
year," Bernstein said. "It was our
first time and hopefully the girls
will learn and feel what it was like
to be here and have that feeling af-
terwards, (of) not doing our best."
Most of the Michigan squad trav-
eled back to Ann Arbor after the
loss, but a select few received the
opportunity to stay in Georgia.
No. 19 junior Denise Muresan
and the doubles duo of Taney and
Tatsuno will be staying for this
week's upcoming NCAA Individual
Championships.
"They're excited and I'm excited
for them," Bernstein said. "It's a
great opportunity and a reward for
a great year that they've had indi-
vidually for us."
It's easy to criticize a team that
fell out of the tournament earlier
than expected. But to a coach who
preached unity and teamwork all
year, Bernstein simply saw it as a
bright flame dying out a little too
soon.
"The goal was to peak at the
end of the year, and I think the last
couple of weeks we've been a little
bit off, tobe honest," Bernstein said.
"There's not much in particular (to
work on). We just need to make
sure that at the end of the year
we're playing our best tennis."
Bernstein is excited to get into
the off-season training period and
start preparing for the fall. With a
tup-10 recruiting class coming in,
the first part of the year will be that
much more important.
"It's a clean slate," Bernstein
said. "Nobody has a spot won in
the lineup, by any means. The fall is
where they can show their stuff, so
it's going to be important not only
for our freshmen to come ready to
go, but for the veterans to know
that it's not time to take a couple of
months off."
