Detroit lost
25 percent of
residents in decade
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
Though several municipali-
ties across Michigan may see
changes in state or federal
funding they receive due to

dips in population sizes, Ann
Arbor is most likely not one of
them.
The results of the U.S. Cen-
sus, which were released yes-
terday, show that though Ann
Arbor's population has not sub-
stantially changed in the last 10
years, the population in Washt-
enaw County has increased by
about 7 percent. But a more sig-
nificant change has occurred in
Detroit, where the city's popula-

tion diminished by 25 percent in
the past decade.
While its population has
remained fairly constant, Ann
Arbor has moved up from the
seventh to the sixth largest city
in the state.
Lisa Neidert, senior research
associate inthe Population Stud-
ies Center at the University's
Institute for Social Research,
said the population changes
were mostly expected and there

was nothing "real earth shatter-
ing" about Ann Arbor's results.
However, Neidert said a
closer examination of Ann
Arbor would most likely reveal
significant changes about the
population. She pointed to racial
dynamics in the city as a key
area of interest for her, saying
she plans to analyze if the His-
panic and Asian populations
have increased.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS
Polling stations to be used
for first time in 10 years

LSA-SG candidates uncontested

Voting method
aimed at raising
voter turnout
By ROBIN VEECK
Daily StaffReporter
Students casting their bal-
lots in student government
elections today and tomorrow
will be able to do so at various
locations around campus - not
just in front of their laptop.
In addition to voting online,

ballots can be cast at polling
stations in University resi-
dence halls and other locations
on campus - a voting method
the Michigan Student Assem-
bly and LSA Student Govern-
ment last employed more than
a decade ago. The added option
is in an effort to increase low
voter turnout and avoid digi-
tal problems that have plagued
student government elections
in years past.
In studentgovernment elec-
tions this past fall, roughly 10
percent of the University stu-

dent body voted. Last year's
MSA elections drew voter
participation from 14 percent
of the student body. How-
ever, voter turnout had previ-
ously been lower - with 12.8
percent of students voting in
winter 2009 and 6.4 percent of
students voting in the winter
2008 elections.

voting stations to online vot-
ing, we kind of lost a couple

After spending five semesters
on the LSA Student Government,
LSA juniors Anne Laverty and
Jeff Larkin have their sights on
the organization's top positions.
Laverty and Larkin, who are
running uncontested for LSA-
SG president and vice president,
respectively, in the elections
today and tomorrow, are stress-
ing the importance of making
sure the voices of LSA students
are heard and valued by their
governing body.

LSA juniors Anne Laverty and Jeff Larkin pose for a portrait yesterday.

Laverty and Larkin became
active members of LSA-SG dur-
ing the second semester of their
freshman year and currently

hold positions on the body's
executive board as secretary and

DPS Oversight Cmte. lacks student interest

Increase in funding

By BRANDON SHAW
For the Daily
Students may have to reach
into their pockets for an extra
dollar if an LSA Student Gov-
ernment initiative passes in

this week's election.
Appearing on the Michigan
Student Assembly election bal-
lot today and tomorrow, LSA-
SG is proposing an increase
from $1.50 to $2.50 in student
dues paid per semester to vari-
ous colleges at the University.
LSA-SG officials estimate the
$1 increase per student will
result in an additional $18,000
for each school's budget.
LSA-SG President Steven

Benson, who spearheaded the
initiative, said 85 percent of
LSA-SG's budget goes directly
to student groups and event
planning. The other 15 percent
is reserved for internal com-
mittee use and discretionary
spending.
The amount that University
students payto their respective
colleges hasn't been increased

PABLO MARTINEZ MONSIVAIS/AP
President Barack Obarna answers question on the ongoing situation in Libya during his joint news conference with El
Salvador President Mauricio Funes at the National Palace in San Salvador, El Salvador, yesterday.
Obama: U.S. to turn over control
of Libya operations within days

Administration will
not request funding
from Congress
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
four-day air assault in Libya will
soon achieve the objectives of
establishing a no-fly zone and
averting a massacre of civilians
by Moammar Gadhafi's troops,
President Barack Obama said
yesterday, adding that despite
squabbling among allies, the
United States will turn control of
the operation over to other coun-
tries within days.
"When this transition takes
place, it is not going to be our
planes that are maintaining the
no-fly zone. It is not going to
be our ships that are necessar-
ily enforcing the arms embargo.
That's precisely what the other
nations are going to do," the
president said at a news confer-
ence in El Salvador as he neared
the end of a Latin American
trip overshadowed by events in
Libya.
He spoke as one senior Amer-
ican military official said the
Persian Gulf nation of Qatar
was expected to start flying air
patrols over Libya by this week-
end, becoming the first member
of the Arab League to partici-
pate directly in the military
mission.

The president also suggested
the administration would not
need to request funding from
Congress for the air operations
but would pay for them out of
money already approved.
Administration officials
briefed lawmakers during the
day about costs and other details
to date.
Criticism of the operation
has been muted so far, with the
president out of the country, but
is likely to increase once he flies
home today - a few hours earlier
than had been scheduled.
The Pentagon said two dozen
more Tomahawk cruise missiles
were launched from U.S. and
British submarines late Monday
and early yesterday againstLiby-
an targets, raisingthe total to 161
aimed at disabling Gadhafi's air
defenses.
Adm. Samuel J. Locklear III
said Libyan ground troops will
be more vulnerable as the coali-
tion grows in size and capability,
but he declined to provide details
of future targeting. He spoke to
reporters at the Pentagon from
aboard his command ship in the
Mediterranean Sea.
The president and Pentagon
officials have stressed since the
military campaign began that
America would quickly give
other countries the lead.
"I think fairly shortly we are
going to be able to say that we've

achieved the objective of a no-fly
zone. We will also be able to say
that we have averted immediate
tragedy," Obama said.
He told reporters he had spo-
ken earlier with British Prime
Minister David Cameron and
French President Nicolas Sar-
kozy in hopes of quickly resolv-
ing a dispute over the transition
of the military mission.
With congressional critics
growing more vocal, the presi-
dent defended the wisdom of the
operation so far.
"It is in America's national
interests to participate... because
no one has a bigger stake in mak-
ingsure that there arebasic rules
of the road that are observed,
that there is some semblance of
order and justice, particularly
in a volatile region that's going
through great changes," Obama
said
With longtime autocratic gov-
ernments under pressure else-
where in the Arab world, the
president made clear his decision
to dispatch U.S. planes and ships
did not automatically signal he
would do so everywhere.
"That doesn't mean we can
solve every problem in the 0
world," he said.
Several members of Con-
gress, including a number
from Obama's own party, were
increasingly questioning the
wisdom of U.S. involvement.

Proposal to reject
same-sex health
benefits stalls
A bid to rescind the extension
of state-paid health insurance
coverage to same-sex partners
or other adults living with some
state employees stalled yester-
day in the Michigan House.
A resolution that would reject
the extension of benefits did not
get enough votes to pass with
the required two-thirds major-
ity in the Republican-led cham-
ber. The measure was getting
65 votes - nine short of the 74
needed - when the vote board
was cleared without an official
count announced.
Republicans say they have
until April 18 to pass the reso-
lution, and they likely will try
again before that deadline. The
resolution already has passed
with a two-thirds majority in the
Republican-led Senate.

criticizes amount

United Auto Workers Presi-

Alan Mulally earlier this month.
King spoke at a union meet-
ing that sets goals for bargaining
a new labor contract with auto-
makers later this year.
"I think Alan Mulally is a
great CEO, but I don't think
any human being in the world
deserves that much money,"
King said at the opening of a
three-day UAW convention in
Detroit. The UAW's current con-
tract with Detroit's three auto-
makers expires Sept. 14.
Mulally received stock valued
at $56.6 million, before taxes,
for his performance in 2009 and
2010. His total compensation for
2010 hasn't yet been released.
Ford Motor Co. responded
that Mulally's leadership has
been "widely recognized as
extraordinary."
PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich.
Video of shooting

A decision to clear a Michigan

shooting became available, pros-

The patrol car video of the Jan.
15 shooting in by Pittsfield Town-

viously wasn't available because
of problems with the recording

FDA forbids sale
of defective heart
and lung devices
The federal government is
legally barring a Michigan com-
pany from selling life-sustaining
devices used in heart surgery,
following years of quality con-
trol problems at company facili-
ties.
The Food and Drug Adminis-
tration said yesterday it signed
a permanent injunction with
Terumo Cardiovascular Systems
and two executives that bars
them from making and distrib-
uting heart-lung bypass systems
and similar machines to new
customers. The devices are used
to circulate blood during chest
surgery.
Terumo agreed to pay $35 mil-
lion in back profits from the sale
of its devices and additional fines
if it doesn't comply with the gov-
ernment's terms.

FEES

went from $1 to $1.50. MSA has
implemented three fee increases
since that time.
LSA-SG Vice President Carly
Goldberg said the student gov-
ernment researched the effects
of the potential fee increase,
including its impact on student
governments at the University.
LSA-SG talked with other col-
leges and school student gov-
ernments, Royster Harper, the
University's vice president for
student affairs, and the Univer-
sity's Dean of Students Laura
Blake-Jones, who all agreed the
fee increase would have a posi-
tive effect on each student gov-
ernment, Goldberg said.
LSA-SG's research shows that
$1.50 in 1998 amounts to $1.98 in
today due to inflation - some-
thing Goldberg and Benson are
using as a central argument for
their proposed initiative.

brought before the University
Senate at yesterday's meeting.
The group voted 51-66 against
an action item that would have
allotted more discussion time
for University Provost Philip
Hanlon's tenure probationary
period proposal, which would
allow schools to extend the
period of time in which faculty
members can be granted tenure
status from eight to 10 years.
Physics Prof. Keith Riles said
LSA-SG

Laverty said Larkin has
extensive experience with bud-
getary issues and academic
affairs, while she has a strong
focus on student life at the Uni-
versity. Larkin explained that
their different perspectives and
past work are, in part, what
make the two a dynamic and
competent pair.
"The different experiences
that we've had, bringing that
together, it reflects the whole
government," Larkin said. "So
I think that's what makes us
really well qualified to run, is we
know a lot about everything that
goes on because we've done so
many different things. I person-
allywanted to be a part of Anne's
team."
The duo's platform aims to
improve multiple dimensions of
campus life, beginning with col-
laboration between LSA-SG and
other student groups and school
departments.
LSA-SG currently sponsors
Diag Days - in which represen-
tatives provide free food and
information about LSA-SG to

students - but these events have
often conflicted with the efforts
of other groups that are also
trying to fundraise or advertise
CENSUS
From Page 1A
Ann Arbor's population has
been "very steady" for the past
few years, and its rise in the
population size rank doesn't
have major implications for
the city since many Michigan
cities have similar population
numbers, Neidert said. She said
while the local results didn't
surprise her, other numbers did.
Detroit saw a 25-percent loss in
population and Wayne County
recorded a 12-percent overall
population drop, according to
the results.
Detroit's results are notable
considering that the counties
that surround Wayne County
and Detroit - like Washtenaw
County - didn't absorb Detroi-
ters who left the city, Neidert
said. Since Michigan doesn't
require residents to register their
new addresses with authorities
after they move, it's difficult to

cents to students' tuition to fund
student organizations, passed
at the time. But the initiative
wasn't taken to the University
provost or Board of Regents,
which approves the fiscal budget
every June. According to Gold-
berg, the proposal was intended
merely to garner student feed-
back on the concept.
She said students and Univer-
sity administrators have been
receptive to the proposal, add-
ing that LSA-SG holds "Lunch
with the Representatives" meet-
ings in an effort to connect to
their student constituency and
receive feedback.
Benson stressed the impor-
tance of student voter partici-
pation in the election. He said
students often express interest
ininitiatives for school planning,
but few actively participate in
the voting and election process.
He added that he is confident if
the same students who approved
last year's 50-cent increase turn
out to vote in this election, the
measure will pass.
Because of its possible impact
he didn't support the action
item because he wanted the fac-
ulty to move on with more spe-
cific actions.
James Woolliscroft, dean
of the University's Medical
School, said he is in favor of
each school being allowed to
opt for Hanlon's tenure pro-
posal on an individual basis.
He said extending the tenure
probationary period could be
important for many employees
in the Medical School.
"In the Medical School, our
faculty colleagues determine
when somebody is ready to be
put forward for promotion,"
Woolliscroft said during the
meeting. "This is done within
each department. It is a critical
process."
The University Senate
in the Diag, Laverty said. To
resolve issues like this and to get
more students involved in LSA-
SG events, Laverty said she is
planning to limit the number of
LSA-SG functions and increase
collaboration with other orga-
nizations like University leader-
ship councils.
She added that she feels LSA-
SG should be more proactive in
reaching out to students on cam-
pus.
"Right now, student govern-
ment is just not very reflective of
the constituents we represent,"
Laverty said.
Laverty and Larkin are also
aiming to make the student
government more transparent
by changing the bylaws that
address LSA-SG's election pro-
cedures.
"We're trying to change that
because we want to give more of
our body a chance to be involved
in who they selectt," Larkin said.
Another bylaw change they're
considering would call for LSA-
SG members to represent a cer-
tain group of constituents, rather
than all LSA students, in order
to increase the accountability
of representatives. Already dis-

cussed among LSA-SG members
for some time, the proposed
change would involve defining
each constituency based on spe-
cifics like concentrations or loca-
know where the departing resi-
dents ended up, she said.
Jim Kosteva, the University's
director of community relations,
said the census results aren't
particularly relevant to the Uni-
versity.
"The census has relatively lit-
tle direct impact upon the Uni-
versity since there are few, if any,
financial awards or grants that
have any relationship to popula-
tion," Kosteva said.
However, any changes
regarding city funding could
have an indirect impact on the
University community, he said.
Ann Arbor City Council
member Mike Anglin (D-Ward
5) said he thinks Ann Arbor's
population stability is most like-
ly due to a constant influx and
outflow of students, profession-
als and other people who aren't
grounded in the city.
"We have a subpopulation of
transients for sure," Anglin said,
adding that he doesn't think city
funding will be greatly affected

on all University colleges, Ben-
son said it's important for stu-
dents to vote in the election.
"It is imperative that students
understand that this directly
affects them, and not only vote,
but encourage others around
them to vote," Benson said.
"This initiative and others on
the ballot have a direct impact
on all students."
Goldberg also said if the bal-
lot initiative is approved by the
majority of voters this week,
she is confident it will pass Uni-
versity Provost Philip Hanlon's
approval process and make it
into the budget at the regent's
meeting in June.
Several students, including
LSA freshman Erin Huffnagel
and LSA senior Matt LaChance,
said they support the initiative
because the college-specific
governments do a lot for their
schools.
"Everyone has a dollar,"
LaChance said. "To say this isn't
worth it is just wrong. They do
great things and should definite-
ly have my money."
members also voted against
another action, which would
have allowed individual fac-
ulty members to pause their
tenure clock for a one-year
period without need for Univer-
sity approval. Faculty members
would have been able to exer-
cise this option twice, the time
of which they would choose
themselves.
University Senate members
motioned to add a fourth action
item, which declared the Sen-
ate Assembly's hesitance about
making any changes to the
University's Board of Regents'
bylaws concerning tenure. A
similar measure was passed
in January. The members
endorsed this action item with
70 yes votes, 42 no votes and
eight abstentions.
tions of constituents' residences,
Laverty said.
"We can learn more what stu-
dents want if you're dealing with
the same group of constituents
the whole time," Larkin said.
Laverty and Larkin are also
striving to make the LSA-SG
website more interactive for stu-
dents by updating the minutes
of weekly meetings, detailing
the resolutions passed by the
government and adding a forum
throughwhich students can pro-
vide input.
"Hopefully by allowing stu-
dents to ask questions, we can
converse with them more," Lar-
kin said. "That will get more stu-
dents engaged, it will get more
people to join student govern-
ment and be interested in what
we're doing, too."
Laverty added that another
way she and Larkin hope to gain
feedback from students is by
introducing college town hall
meetings to address pressing
issues at the University includ-
ing campus safety and problems
with the LSA course guide.
"We elicit feedback from (stu-
dents) every semester, but more
feedback doesn't hurt ..." Larkin
said. "So as we move forward

into a new age and a new chapter
at the University, what students
want is always changing, so we
always have to keep up."
by the results.
"I don't see the state funding
changing very much," Anglin
said. "I think more and more of
the burden of local government
is going to remain with local
government and that revenue
sharing ... will start to cut back."
Anglin said he thinks other
cities in the state experienced
population losses due to changes
in the automotive industry. But
Ann Arbor has a more "sustain-
able employment situation than
most," he said.
Still, Anglin said he's not sure
Ann Arbor has "good jobs" to
offer, adding that he would like
to see more manufacturing com-
panies in the city.
"The fact that someone is
employed in retail, as far as I'm
concerned, is not one of the jobs
that I would put in the middle
class," he said.
More important to the city's
population sustainability, Anglin
said, is keeping companies that
were started here in Ann Arbor.

DPS

who are nominated and elected
by their representative groups.
The election system was cre-
ated after independent lawyers
told The Michigan Daily in fall
2009 that members of the com-
mittee weren't being elected in
accordance with Michigan stat-
ute Public Act 120 of 1990 - the
act that created the commit-
tee. In the past, students were
appointed to the committee by
the Michigan Student Assembly
but, the student members are
now elected during student gov-
ernment elections, which are
taking place today and tomor-
row.
Steele said her experience as a
board member of the University's
chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union and her famil-
iarity with student rights issues
gives her a fresh perspective and
qualifies her for the position.
"I'm really passionate about
civil liberties and social justice,
and I want to bring that perspec-
tive to the DPS Oversight Com-
mittee to protect the rights of
students and anyone associated
with the University," Steele said.
If faced with a topic she is
unfamiliar with, Steele said her
interest in law would help her
form an educated opinion on the
subject.
"I have a natural curios-
ity about these legal issues, so
if there is anything that comes
to the table that I don't feel I'm
aware about or that I'm not qual-
ified to have an opinion about,
then I will do the research to
make an informed opinion,"
Steele said.
LSA senior Rebecca Egler
and LSA sophomore Hari Vutu-
kuru currently hold the student
spots on the committee. How-
ever, at the end of the semester,
Vutukuru's term will expire and
Egler - whose term officially
ends in the fall - will be stepping
down since she's graduating this
spring. Therefore, the committee
will only have one student mem-
ber come May, if Steele is elected,
and will be in violation of state
law.
To remedy this problem,
MSA rules chair Kyle Summers
said write-in candidates could
potentially fill the empty seat. He

added that if the seat isn't filled in
this week's election, it would be
open for re-election in the fall.
However, MSA Student Gen-
eral Counsel Timothy Bekkers
wrote in an e-mail interview that
he was concerned about the legit-
imacy of write-in candidates.
"One of the problems with
write-in candidates, however, is
that many times they're not actu-
ally supported by the actual indi-
vidual, so that person may not
actually want to serve even if he/
she is the runner-up from write-
in ballots," Bekkers wrote.
He added that he thinks the
new system, in which only elect-
ed students can hold a position
on the committee, is problematic
because there isn't enough stu-
dent interest in the committee to
ensure there are enough candi-
dates every semester.
Steele said if she's elected, she
would keep students' opinions in
mind whenconsideringgrievanc-
es brought before the committee.
She added that she wouldn't pro-
pose any major changes to the
committee because it only oper-
ates in an advisory role.
During her involvement in
the ACLU, Steele founded the
Civil Liberties Peer Educa-
tor Program - which informs
students about proper conduct
when encountering the police
- participated in MSA's Open
Housing campaign to instate
gender-neutral housing in Uni-
versity residence halls and
advocated to reform the Uni-
versity's trespass policy. The
trespass policy has been widely
criticized recently for its review
and expiration components,
though Suellyn Scarnecchia,
the University's vice president
and general counsel, proposed
alterations to the policy earlier
this month.
Steele said she will continue
working forthe ACLU and is cur-
rently running unopposed for
chair of the University's chapter.
She added that she would keep
her role as member of the ACLU
distinct from her position on the
DPS Oversight Committee.
"I would view my roles on the
ACLU and DPS Oversight Com-
mittee as separate, so my advo-
cacy to changes to the trespass
policy will be done as part of the
ACLU and not necessarily as part
of the DPS Oversight Commit-
tee," Steele said.


POLLING

tor, said.
Voting stations, which will
be staffed by student volun-
teers, will operate in locations
including the Michigan League,
Michigan Union, Pierpont Com-
mons and Mason Hall, as well
as in select residence halls. Can-
didates and campaign materials
will not be allowed within 50 feet
of voters.
Patterson said election offi-
cials, using the slogan "Vote
Because It Matters," have been
focused on making elections
more visible among the student
body.
"We are emphasizing the
financial stake people have in
MSA and LSA-SG, and how
instrumental we are in organiz-
ing peoples' funds, their pro-
grams and things that they would
like to do," Patterson said.
$7.19 of each student's tuition
goes to funding MSA's projects
and the organizations it spon-
sors, and LSA students pay an
additional $1.50 to LSA-SG,
accordingto Patterson.
"It's important for you to know
howyour moneyisspent; andyou
make sure that the official that
was elected is going to spend that
money on what needs to be done,
and in the interest of every stu-
dent," Patterson said.
Patterson said another advan-
tage of the voting stations is
being able to avoid a number of
technical voting issues that have
occurred in past years as a result
of the online method. MSA's
online elections have been inter-
rupted repeatedly over the past
10 years by technical issues and
attempted fraud. In last year's
MSA elections, problems with
the randomization mechanism
- which ensures the anonymity
of voters - on the online ballot
had the potential to affect about
1,000 votes, which were cast
before the issue was fixed.
"There's more of an opportu-
nity to take care of those prob-
lems onsite than if someone were
to say, 'Oh, my computer isn't
working,"' Patterson said.

In this week's elections, stu-
dents will also have the oppor-
tunity to vote on ballot questions
that may financially impact them
next year. One MSA ballot ques-
tion, which LSA-SG is proposing,
is to raise the amount students in
all colleges pay to their respec-
tive student governments from
$1.50 to $2.50. Another question,
on MSA's ballot, asks if students
are willing to pay up to $4 more
per semester to have access to
paper copies of The New York
Times on campus on week days.
The MSA president, vice presi-
dent and representatives elected
this week will serve a full-year
term, starting at the end of this
semester. Students will also be
able to vote for representatives in
college-specific student govern-
ment elections including LSA-SG
and the University of Michigan
Engineering Council.
To help students understand
the candidates and issues, Pub-
lic Policy junior Zac Berlin, the
election director for LSA-SG,
and Patterson compiled a voter's
guide that willbe available on the
MSA website and in paper form
at pollingstations.
"We also want voters who
aren'tjust voting randomly," Ber-
lin said. "We want people who
are informed about the election,
people who are informed about
the candidates."
Despite student government
officials' efforts, several students
said they were not interested in
the elections.
Engineering junior Greg
Caldwell said he wasn't planning
on voting, calling the student
government elections "worth-
less."
LSA sophomore Ashley Mo
said she was only aware of the
new polling plan because she
heard about it in one of her class-
es.
"I feel like I've seen something
but not a significant amount (of
advertisements)," Mo said. "I feel
like I see more cultural events on
campus advertising than voting
for elections."

Vote Watson Campbell
Support MForward candidates in MSA election
tudent engagement in the Michigan Student Assembly has
been lacking in recent years. There seems to be a debilitating
disconnection between MSA representatives and their student
constituents. But MSA presidential and vice presidential candidates
DeAndree Watson and Brendan Campbell, both LSA juniors from the
MForward Party, are hoping to combat this disinterest among stu-
dents and have plans to do so. Watson's extensive experience serving
on MSA, personal goals to improve the University's student govern-
ment, selection of Campbell as vice president and MForward's strong
party platform all bring a fresh perspective to the table - making the
MForward ticket the strongest in this year's MSA election.

Go vote, go blue

have the task of convincing you
to vote in the student govern-
ment elections taking place

today and tomor-
row.
Why should
you vote? After
all, won't stu-
dent government
continue on just
the same with-
out your input?
Won't students
running for
office continue

JEFF
WOJCIK

One of the most encouraging qualities about
Watson is his willingness to acknowledge that
student perceptions of MSA are less than favor-
able. He told The Michigan Daily that "a lot of
students see MSA as a bank (and) don't really
see the advocacy of it." Many of his goals aim
to reverse the trend of student apathy. Specifi-
cally, Watson plans to make MSA meetings and
its budget more transparent to University stu-
dents. His plan to publish the approved budget
and weekly presidential addresses on the MSA
website will certainly help to make MSA more
accessible to students.
Having institutional knowledge of the
way MSA functions is crucial to success as
president, and Watson currently serves as the
speaker in the three-branch MSA system. He
is aware of the pitfalls and advantages of this
newly formulated system and will be the best
candidate to ensure MSA operates efficiently.
Watson's plans to improve the campus com-
munity is in line with student concerns, and he
has realistic plans for addressing these issues.
Some of his objectives include working to
implementthe open housing plan that students
originally formulated, combating bias inci-
dents on campus and working with the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents and state legislators to
fight tuition hikes.
Defend Affirmative Action Party candidates
Briana Hatcher, an LSA freshman running
for MSA president, and Lena Cintron, an LSA
sophomore running for MSA vice president,

have positive ideas like interacting with con-
stituents through mixers and social events
and creating a more unified campus. But their
lack of experience with student government is
concerning. Additionally, their platform is too
focused on advocating for particular issues,
instead of improving MSA and making sure it
operates efficiently for the entire student body.
It's difficult to blame students for their dis-
content with MSA. Many of their concerns are
valid and result from the lack of transparency
in the way MSA functions and uses student
funds. But if students don't take the few min-
utes to vote for MSA officials, they forfeit their
right to complain about the actions of these
individuals.
While uncontested, LSA Student Gov-
ernment elections are just as important for
students. Junior Anne Laverty, running for
president, and junior Jeff Larkin, running for
vice president, feel that student access to their
student government is vital. They have palpable
plans to increase student involvement in LSA-
SG by adding a forum feature to the LSA-SG
website, holding college town hall meetings and
collaborating with organizations on campus.
For this year's election, The Michigan
Daily's editorial board endorses MForward's
DEANDREE WATSON and BRENDAN
CAMPBELL for MSA president and vice pres-
ident. We also endorse ANNE LAVERTY and
JEFF LARKIN for LSA-SG president and vice
president.

advocating for
student rights, even without your
support? The answer to this ques-
tion is yes, but student voter turnout
has a huge impact on our ability to
advocate for policy reform around
campus. We often approach the
dean's office with new ideas, (typi-
cally recommendations which come
out of suggestions from students
e-mailing thissucks@umich.edu).
These recommendations have great-
er meaning and more impact when
we can show that a larger contin-
gency of the student body supports
them. With each additional student
who votes in our election, our argu-
ments and voice become stronger.
And at a University with an ever-
increasing volume of requests for
improvements in technology, facili-
ties and other resources, sometimes
the student voice can be pushed
aside. A higher turnout in elections
means a higher degree of student
control over the direction and mis-
sion of LSA and the University.
The people you vote for make a
difference in your experience at the
University. In the past, students who
won elections went on to help create
the international studies concentra-
tion, and others have developed the
way roommates are selected for those
entering the residence halls without
a roommate. Elections have chosen
people who organized art contests

and provided a voice for students to
advocate for decreasing the cost of
textbooks. Members of student orga-
nizations can thank elected students
for cutting internal University oper-
ating costs the past eight semesters
to provide more funding for lectures,
service projects and other events that
happen every day on campus.
Student government represen-
tatives actually have an impact on
what goes on at the University, and
when you cast your vote, you express
what you think student government
should work on through your selec-
tion of the people who representyou.
Each candidate has a platform that
represents what work he or she will
do over the coming year, and you
should elect those who will work
on things that are important to you.
This includestackling wireless issues
in the UGLi, maximizing printing
resources and addressing academic
policies that directly influence how
you learn at the University.
In my previous columns, I have
outlined a few of the new poli-
cies, programs and resources we
are advocating for on behalf of stu-
dents. Changes to the course guide,
improvements to exam scheduling
and increases to student organiza-
tion funding are only a sample of the
items we lobbied for in just the past
six months. I have received a lot of
feedback from people across campus
expressing agreement with our advo-
cacy efforts as well as disappoint-
ment with our work. This election
is an opportunity for you to indicate
concrete endorsement or criticism
about our actions and ensure we
work for you. We operate on behalf
of students and motivate administra-
tors to change their practicesto focus
on the things that are important to
students. Your representatives are
responsible for improving your LSA
experience. They just need your vote
to know what to work on and to pro-
vide strength to student voice.

Outside voting for student repre-
sentatives, you also have the ability
to weigh in on three ballot questions
relevant to your experience here at
the University. Each semester, we
take the data we acquire from sur-
veying students in our elections and
mold this information into new poli-
cies and ideas for LSA and the Uni-
versity. These ballot questions allow
you to clearly indicate your priorities
for student work on issues pertain-
ing to all aspects of student life and
requests that you dictate how we
advance the University from a stu-
dent perspective. We want honest
answers and strong data to demon-
strate to the LSA dean's office and
other entities what the student body
wants and how that wish list should
be prioritized.
Voter turnout has
a huge impact on
policy reform.
Please take the time to vote in the
student government elections today
and tomorrow by going online to
vote.umich.edu. It only takes a few
minutes for you to read a little about
what your fellow students are doing
on your behalf and endorse their
work. Supporting our efforts through
voting allows us to push harder for
these changes and make an impact
on the rules and resources you expe-
rience at the University. Your vote
indicates that student activism is
important at Michigan and provides
the support for that activism to work.
Go vote, go blue.

Moving (M)forward

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

Melanie Kruvelis, Patrick Maillet, Erika Mayer, Harsha Nahata, Emily Orley,
Harsha Panduranga, Teddy Papes, Asa Smith, Seth Soderborg, Andrew Weiner

When MForward began nearly a year ago,
the promise of ideas, action and community
truly resonated with me as a student leader,
as it did with all those who decided to run for
positions on the Michigan Student Assembly
on the MForward ticket. Although we all knew
it would be an uphill battle, we didn't let these
odds discourage us from setting in motion a new
approachto student governance. As a result, this
first year has not only yielded many improve-
ments to campus but, perhaps mostimportantly,
it has created anew tone for leadership and new
foundation off of which future representatives
can base their work inyears to come.
The mission of MForward includes an
emphasis on increasing the extent to which
studentorganizations can access MSA resourc-
es. By working with Student Parking and
Transportation Services, we were able to cre-
ate a $5,000 budget to fund groups that require
vehicles to carry out their service-based ini-
tiatives. We also launched the "Get Involved
Campaign," which started activities like Diag
Days dedicated to promoting our many won-
derful arts and service organizations and
eventslike Explorthto bring information about
these opportunities to North Campus.
To continue these efforts, current MFor-
ward representatives are meeting with Uni-
versity administrators to improve Festifall
by making it more environmentally friendly,
easier to navigate and more accessible for stu-
dents with disabilities. MForward represen-
tatives are partnering with the Office of New
Student Programs and Student Activities and
Leadership to institute a panel at orientation
which student leaders can share with incoming
students the importance of involvement. This
program will begin this June.
Another cornerstone of the MForward phi-
losophy is to improve and publicize our inter-
nal activities as means to hold representatives
more accountable to the studentbody. Our new
website, which we created without spending
any student tuition dollars, now contains infor-
mation aboutcvoting records, attendance, meet-
ing minutes, agendas and resolutions.
Furthermore, the new MSA Constitution,
initiated by the MForward leadership, is near-
ing the end of its transitional period. The con-

tents of this document will establish a better
system of checks and balances through the cre-
ation of different branches of government. One
of the new positions it defines, chief program-
ming officer, has already helped the University
produce several campus-wide events, and the
implementation of a University Council will
facilitate greater communication between dif-
ferentbodies of student governance.
In terms of advocacy, MForward has long
held the belief that student government should
both reflect and defend the needs of all those
who it represents, especially for communities
whose members constantly suffer the injus-
tices of certain University standards. We feel
that advocacy includes everything from intro-
ducing new areas of CAEN printing and work-
space on Central Campus to lobbying at our
nation's capitol among other in-state and Big
Ten university leaders for increased access to
and affordability of higher education.
Among the accomplishments of MSA under
MForward leadership in the past year, our
advances in implementing the open housing
policy ranks near the top of the list. Because
of our tireless work among a coalition of sup-
portive organizations, transgender and gender
non-conforming students now have the oppor-
tunity to room with another student regardless
of their gender. Although we still have a long
way to go, we have made great strides toward
our goal of establishing a completely compre-
hensive policy that will eliminate housing
discrimination on the basis of gender identity,
gender expression and sexual orientation.
These are just some of the many examples of
the direction in which MForward has moved
student governance. Not only will the mem-
bers of its ticket continue the incredible work
their predecessors have begun, but they will
also have a better space in which to introduce
new initiatives in the name of ideas, action and

BRIANA HATCHER I

Defend DAAP

LSA sophomore Lena Cintron and I are running to
become Michigan Student Assembly vice president and
president for three reasons. First, we believe that the
increased privatization of our University is distorting
and deforming the experience of students on this cam-
pus and that the toll of the privatization effort is far
greater than any of the short term benefits. The loss
of affirmative action as a public mandate has paved
the way for the unprecedented attack on public edu-
cation that we are now facing. Over the past decade,
the University has become increasingly reliant on pri-
vate funds, which is stifling honest research, social
criticism and academic freedom and creating a hostile
campus climate for minority students. Cuts to funding
for public universities, tuition hikes, and increasing
reliance on private donors, in particular for minority
scholarships, place us under more pressure to be edu-
cated. Public education is a fundamental democratic
right; we should have the resources and opportunities
to explore our many interests and talents and deter-
mine our own futures.
Second, we believe that only we as students can
rescue, restore and revive our University's traditions
of academic independence, integration, diversity and
accountability to the people of our state. We oppose
the recent statement by University President Mary Sue
Coleman that we're prepared to share in the sacrifice
for state budget cuts to education. We don't have to
accept the tuition hikes and budget cuts that fall on the
backs of students and employees, while corporations
are receiving tax cuts. Students are the most power-
ful force on this campus and should be determiningthe
character and direction of our University, but we lack
the leadership and organization needed for us to assert
our will and power. The Defend Affirmative Action
Party exists to provide that leadership.
Third, we want to make the University a more wel-
coming, more interesting, less lonely and less alien-
ating campus. We believe that our University can be
a place in which all students here feel supported and
respected and are able to think critically, accept new
challenges and grow as human beings. We believe that

the much touted diversity of our campus, which few of
us experience as a meaningful part of our lives, ought
to challenge our prejudices, expose us to new ideas and
cultures and deepen our understanding of our own
humanity and potential. For this to occur, our campus
would have to become far less segregated and strati-
fied.
DAAP is the longest standing and only consistently
progressive independent student political party at the
University. Nowmorethanever we need astudent party
prepared to take on the bullies, cynics and liars and
unite all the progressive forces on the campus against
our common enemies. We pledge to make MSA an inde-
pendent and strong advocate for student rights and for
the kind of university that can allow each and every one
of us to be ourselves and express and develop our spe-
cial talents and gifts. We pledge to defend and further
the University's longstanding commitment to diver-
sity and free speech by restoring the public character
of our institution. We pledge to be the voice of minor-
ity, immigrait, international, poor and working class,
inner city and rural and progressive students on cam-
pus. We pledge to women, LGBTQ, Muslim and other
students who face harassment, threats and discrimina-
tion, date rape and other forms of physical attack that
we will fight to improve our campus climate and condi-
tions so that this campus is really your home. We pledge
to immigrant students with and without papers that we
will fight for the DREAM Act and to make our Univer-
sity a sanctuary campus. We pledge to all the campus
unions and workers to raise your issues to MSA and to
educate students on the significance of your issues so
that greater unity between us all is possible.
If anyone can stop the runaway train of privatiza-
tion, restore and revitalize public education, it's us.
Other campuses are organizing. We here at the Uni-
versity can lead, as we have so many times before, a
powerful student movement for civil rights, public
education, internationalism and progress.
Briana Hatcher is the DAAP presidential
candidate. She is an LSA freshman.

NY Times journalists say
they were abused in Libya

Photographers,
reporter freed after
six days, driver' s
location unknown
NEW YORK (AP) - A team of
New York Times journalists said
in a story published on the news-
paper's website yesterday that
Libyan soldiers physically abused
them and threatened to kill them
during the six days they were
held in captivity.
The journalists said they were
captured when their driver mis-
takenly drove into a checkpoint
manned by Libyan forces on
March15.
The journalists - reporter
Anthony Shadid, videographer
Stephen Farrell and photogra-
phers Lynsey Addario and Tyler
Hicks - say soldiers tied them
up with wire, an electrical cord, a
scarf and shoelaces and hit them
with fists and rifle butts.
"All of us had had close calls
over the years," they wrote in the

nearly 2,700-word story about
their capture while recount-
ing their previous near-fatal
encounters in combat zones. "At
that moment, though, none of us
thought we were going to live."
They say a soldier said, "Shoot
them."
Addario was punched in the
face and groped, they say, and one
soldier stroked her head and told
her she was going to die.
"You might die tonight," they
quoted the soldier as saying to
her. "Maybe, maybe not."
The journalists wondered
whether a body Addario saw in
their car was that of their driver,
who's still missing.
"We still don't know whether
that was Mohammed. We fear it
was, though his body has yet to
be found," they wrote. "If he died,
we will have to bear the burden
for the rest of our lives that an
innocent man died because of us,
because of wrong choices that
we made, for an article that was
never worth dying for."
The journalists were captured
during fighting in the eastern

part of Libya, where rebel forces
are trying to end the four-decade
rule of leader Moammar Gadhafi.
Gadhafi yesterday made his
first public appearance in a week,
promising supporters at his resi-
dential compound in Tripoli, "In
the short term, we'llbeat them. In
the long term, we'll beat them."
A no-fly zone has been put
in place over the North African
nation, and international coali-
tion forces have pounded Libyan
military targets with missiles.
The Times said Libyan soldiers
had threatened to decapitate
Hicks.
Hicks said the soldiers tempo-
rarily put handcuffs on Shadid so
tightly that he lost feeling in his
hands.
The journalists said that after
they were delivered into the
custody of military intelligence,
an official promised their harsh
treatment would end and it did.
For the last four days of their
captivity, they said, they "fought
boredom more than anything
else" as they waited to find out
their fates.

PABLO MARTINEZ MONSIVAIS/AP
The Obama family poses for a group photo with El Salvador's Foreign Relations Minister yesterday.
Obama promises to
fight drug trafficking

President visits El
Salvador to discuss
economic, energy,
security initiatives
SAN SALVADOR, El Salva-
dor (AP) - President Barack
Obama vowed closer coopera-
tion yesterday with the Central .
American nations where U.S.
policies on crime, immigra-
tion and other issues have out-
size influence on populations
that depend heavily on their
giant neighbor to the north and
impact U.S. society in turn.
Speaking in El Salvador, the
final stop on his three-country
Latin American tour and the
only one in Central America,
Obama promised attention to
increasing trade and economic
growth, fighting drug traffick-
ing and creating opportunities
so that people can find work in
their home countries and "don't
feel like they have to head north
to provide for their families."
"The United States will do
our part" in combatting the
increasing scourge of drug
trafficking, the president said,
standing next to El Salvador's
president Mauricio Funes, who
welcomed Obama's attention
to the oft-overlooked region.
Obama said $200 million would
be spent as part of a new region-
al security partnership meant
to combat drug wars that have
led to a spike in murders here
and in other Central American
countries.
Yet Obama's five-day visit to
Latin America has been over-
shadowed from the start by the
war he's running in faraway
Libya. Just before his news con-
ference with Funes the White
House said Obama would be
cutting his trip short, depart-
ing El Salvador for the U.S. this
morning instead of in the after-
noon as planned.
The U.S. and international
partners are launching mili-
tary strikes to protect civilians
from attacks by Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi. The White

House said Obama was briefed
on developments there by his
national security team yester-
day during a conference call
from Air Force One. He also
spoke with British Prime Minis-
ter David Cameron and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy
while en route from Chile to El
Salvador, to discuss NATO's roll
in the Libya offensive.
Obama said during his news
conference with Funes that he
was confident the U.S. would
transfer control of Libya opera-
tion to an international coali-
tion in days.
And despite Libya's shadow,
Obama sought to make clear
that El Salvador is a criti-
cal partner on immigration
and narcotics wars, issues of
increasing concern to the Unit-
ed States.
Among the issues he and
Funes addressed was the rising
crime south of the U.S. border.
El Salvador has seen murder
rates rise amid an influx of
drugs and displaced traffickers
from crackdowns in Colombia
and Mexico. Obama said a new
partnership to combat nar-
co-trafficking could focus on
strengthening courts and civil
society groups in order to keep
young people from turning to
drugs and crime.
Obama said he was confident
that Funes would show "great
leadership" in using the money
properly.
El Salvador also has one of
Central America's highest rates
of emigration, especially to the
United States. About 2.8 million
Salvadoran immigrants living
in the United States sent home
$3.5 billion last year, so laws
that crack down on immigrants
can significantly affect the
Salvadoran economy. But con-
gressional politics have made
it difficult to restart talks about
overhauling the nation's immi-
gration laws.
Nonetheless Obama recom-
mitted himself to the effort
yesterday in response to a ques-
tion from a Salvadoran reporter.
He said Republicans who now
exert greater control in Wash-

ington were more reluctant
than in the past to engage in
comprehensive reform, but "My
hope is that they begin to recog-
nize over the next year that we
can't solve this problem without
taking a broad comprehensive
approach."
Obama said immigration
reform in the U.S. would also
benefit Latin America, and
would "ensure that relations
between neighbors, and trade
and economic relationsbetween
neighbors is more orderly and
secure."
Obama, along with wife
Michelle Obama and their two
daughters, arrived in the capi-
tal of San Salvador yesterday
afternoon under a blistering
sun following stops in Brazil
and Chile.
After his meeting and
appearance with Funes, Obama
was headed to visit the tomb of
slain Roman Catholic Archbish-
op Oscar Arnulfo Romero at San
Salvador's Metropolitan Cathe-
dral. Romero spoke out against
repression by the U.S.-backed
Salvadoran army during El Sal-
vador's 12-year civil war and
was gunned down March 24,
1980, as he celebrated Mass in
a hospital chapel. Rights activ-
ists and others were welcoming
Obama's decision to visit the
tomb as a gesture of recognition
of Romero's cause.
In a broad-ranging speech in
Chile on Monday that spelled
out his policy in Latin America,
Obama called on the region's
rising economies to take more
responsibility and play a larg-
er role both in the region and
around the globe.
He also described U.S. initia-
tives in Latin America to help
curb the proliferation of drugs.
Congress approved $1.8 billion
for the so-called Merida Initia-
tive to fight drugs in Mexico.
After complaints that Central
America was shortchanged,
Congress created a separate
Central America Regional
Security Initiative with a total
of $248 million so far. Central
American leaders say that has
not been enough.

Anti-government protestors shout slogans during a demonstration demanding the resignation of Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh in Sanaa,Yemen yesterday.
Yemeni president warns of civil war

Protesters swell in
capital as president
refuses to step down
SANAA, Yemen (AP) -
Yemen's U.S.-backed president,
his support crumbling among
political allies and the army,
warned that the country could
slide into a "bloody" civil war
yesterday as the opposition
rejected his offer to step down by
the end of the year. Tens of thou-
sands protested in the capital
demanding his immediate oust-
er, emboldened by top military
commanders who joined their
cause.
Ali Abdullah Saleh's apparent
determination to cling to power
raised fears that Yemen could be
pushed into even greater insta-
bility. In a potentially explo-
sive split, rival factions of the
military have deployed tanks in
the capital Sanaa - with units
commanded by Saleh's son pro-
tecting the president's palace,
and units loyal to a top dissident
commander protecting the pro-
testers.

The defection on Monday of
that commander, Maj. Gen. Ali
Mohsen al-Ahmar, a powerful
regime insider who commands
the army's 1st Armored Division,
has been seen by many as a major
turning point toward a poten-
tially rapid end for Saleh's nearly
32-year rule.
The question is whether the
Yemeni chapter of the uprisings
sweeping the Middle East will
read more like Egypt - where
the resignation of President
Hosni Mubarak set the coun-
try on a relatively stable, if still
uncertain, move toward democ-
racy - or like Libya, which has
seen brutal fighting between
armed camps.
Already, clashes broke out late
Monday between Saleh's Repub-
lican Guard and dissident army
units in the far eastern corner of
the country. On Tuesday, Repub-
lican Guard tanks surrounded a
key air base in the western Red
Sea coastal city of Hodeida after
its commander - Col. Ahmed
al-Sanhani, a member of Saleh's
own clan - announced he was
joining the opposition.
The turmoil raised alarm in

Washington, which has heavily
backed Saleh to wage a campaign
against a major Yemen-based al-
Qaida wing that plotted attacks
in the United States.
U.S. Defense Secretary Rob-
ert Gates, on a trip to Russia,
said yesterday that "instability
and diversion of attention" from
dealing with al-Qaida is a "pri-
mary concern about the situa-
tion." He refused to weigh in on
whether Saleh should step down.
After a month of street pro-
tests - led mainly by students
and pro-democracy advocates -
against his nearly 32-year rule,
Saleh became dramatically more
isolated after security forces
opened fatally shot more than 40
demonstrators on Friday.
The killings set off an ava-
lanche of defections by top
figures in his ruling party, influ-
ential tribal leaders and, most
damagingly, al-Ahmar and a
string of other top generals.
In a meeting yesterday with
his still-loyalist military com-
manders, Saleh railed against the
dissidents, calling them "weak"
and saying they "dropped away
like autumn leaves."

* Egypt's Interior Ministry burns
as police officers protest outside

Interior Ministry's
security forces
associated with
Mubarak regime
CAIRO (AP) - Fire swept the
upper floors of Egypt's Interior
Ministry building yesterday as
policemen protested outside to
demand higher pay. A security
official accused demonstrators
of starting the blaze in down-
town Cairo.
TV footage showed flames
climbing the top floors of the
building and a huge plume of
black smoke filling the sky.
Later, firefighters on tall ladders
sprayed water to extinguish the
fire.
One protester denied they had
lit the fire and accused those
inside of setting if off by burn-

ing security files to get rid of evi-
dence of police abuses.
Many Egyptians still asso-
ciate the Interior Ministry's
security forces with the worst
excesses of the regime of oust-
ed President Hosni Mubarak.
Earlier this month, protesters
rallied outside State Security
offices across the nation, storm-
ing some of them in a search of
evidence of human rights viola-
tions.
Yesterday's protest outside
the ministry, however, was held
by policemen themselves. They
want a minimum salary of $200
a month - much more than
many get now - and other ben-
efits, including improved health
care. The mass demonstrations
that toppled Mubarak on Feb. 11
have set off frequent protests by
laborers, including police offi-
cers, seeking to improve their
lot.

The security official said pro-
testers lit the fire in the build-
ing housing in the ministry's
personnel department. It then
spread to an adjacent communi-
cations building.
One protester who arrived
to see fires burning in the two
buildings said it couldn't have
been started by the crowd
because they had no way of
entering the heavily guarded
compound. He accused workers
inside of burning security files
and starting the blaze.
"It is as if light just started to
arrive and they want to bring
back the darkness," he said, giv-
ing only his first name, Amil,
because he feared government
retribution.
About 15 central security
trucks cordoned off the complex
to prevent demonstrators from
storming it. It remained unclear
how the fire started, though

onlookers said it appeared to
begin in the six-story building's
middle floors, then spread to the
top.
Thousands of people collect-
ed in nearby streets to watch as
four fire trucks extinguished the
blaze. Military police in khaki
uniforms and red berets pre-
vented them from approaching
the building.
Yesterday's demonstration
also called for the return of for-
mer Interior Minister Mahmoud
Wagdi, whom Egypt's military
rulers replaced in a Cabinet
shake-up this month aimed at
removing stalwarts of the
Mubarak regime.
Wagdi, who held the post for
less than a month, was replaced
by Maj. Gen. Mansour el-
Essawy, a former Cairo security
chief who has pledged to restore
security and reduce the role of
the hated State Security agency.

actually find it a lot more the novel," Swedberg said. "It's
sting than the novel really a wonderful construction
se there's not as much as the way the opera is put together

in that Jo is reflecting back on
how things were."
Bringing greater depth to
Adamo's libretto is his equally
accessible neo-romantic score.
"The color he gets out of the
orchestration is very bright,"
said conductor Christopher
Lees, an MT&D lecturer who
also serves as associate direc-
tor of orchestras in MT&D. "It
sounds American. There are lots
of great tunes that I think listen-
ers will leave humming."
Lees explained that the score
for "Little Women," which hap-
pens to be his first foray into
operatic conducting, is rooted in
a series of sung motifs that weave
the plot together and highlight
the central ideas of the piece.
"One of the things that
(Adamo) does is incorporate
musical equivalents of major
themes," Lees said. "So the
theme that Jo tries to hang on to
is the 'Perfect as you are' theme.
And that appears all the way
through the opera, and it's very
tuneful and very accessible. And
a slightly more jagged motive
appears throughout when they
are talking about change - the
'Things change, Jo' theme."
He added, "It's so lyrical and

so beautiful to listen, so I don't
think the musical language will
be a barrier to anyone enjoying
the story."
The conductor also touched on
the pluses of performing a work
by a contemporary composer.
"I've met (Adamo) several
times and we've been in cor-
respondence over the course of
this," Lees said. "The great thing
about doing a piece by a living
composer isthey e-mail you back.
The number of times Mozart has
not responded to my inquiries is
too numerous to count."
Lees stressed the importance
of "Little Women" as a quintes-
sential work of American opera,
but he also pointed out the
work's global appeal and general
accessibility for all audiences of
any gender.
"I would love for people com-
ing away to be moved by the
universality of the themes that
are contained in the piece - to
be able to relate to the journey
that Jo goes on where she has to
choose whether or not to accept
change or to continue pushing
back from it," Swedberg said.
"And I think we all encoun-
ter this in our lives to various
degrees."

" Bewitching books

'Lincoln' logs in a win

Some suprising
literary works just
kick us in the gut
By ANT MITCHELL
Daily Arts Writer
Over the years of my fairly lit-
erary academic career, I've come
to the conclusion that it's not
merely the assumed greatness
of any given book you read that
has an impact. Rather, it's the
stealth with which it manages
to kick you right in your emo-
tional balls that really makes
a book stand out from the rest.
It's the unexpected and out-of-
character book that shocks you
into being impressed. While this
effect by its very definition can
come from nearly anywhere, I
have three favorite sources.
The first falls under the cat-
egory of children's books;,that
shattering content disguised as
innocence. Sometimes I sit and
read children's books - just curl
up in the aisle and take in the
pictures and nostalgic good-
ness while parents and children
step around my inappropriately
adult-sized body. I was in the
process of this relaxing medi-
tation on my own mental age
when I came across "The Big
Ugly Monster and the Little
Stone Rabbit" by Christopher
Wormell. It's not very nicely
* illustrated. It looks unremark-
able. But it managed a bookish
little nip at my tender under-
belly. It tells the story about a
monster so hideous that all of
nature retreats from him in dis-
gust, leaving the lonely monster
talking to rocks. Then the mon-
ster dies, and immediately all
the plants and animals return,
leaving it "a beautiful place now,

perhaps the most beautiful place
in the world," Wormell writes.
Could there be a more sim-
plistic yet unspeakably cruel and
sad book floating about? Possibly.
However, feeling like my story-
bookguts hadbeen pulled out my
throat was not what I'd expected
fromthe children's aisle of Barnes
& Noble. And that's what made it
fantastic. "Strega Nona" and it's
disturbing Italian noodles, "The
Giving Tree" with whispers of
one-sided needy relationships
and the ever-poetic "Frederick"
all share a similar magic.
The second category comes
with a dose of academic pain.
Most have had the experience of
having to read an assigned book
of biblical length. Everyone
shares in the pain when they put
the book off till the last minute,
reading it all at once in a sicken-
ingly slow dose. And while you
make thattorturousjourney, you
hate the book. You hate reading
it: You hate each and every hour,
each page abamboo shoot under
the fingernail in your tired and
dragging mind. But the moment
you come to class there's an
explosion of passion - everyone
wants to talk about the book.
For a brief moment you're all
the same person with a million
voices cathartically listing off
everything you hated and how
painful and terrible and long
the whole experience was. But,
having been brought together
through trauma, each begins to
discover merit where once only
hate could be found.
For me, it was reading James
Michener's 688-page novel
"Caribbean" overnight in high
school. It read like wading
through a mental mud of his-
torical fiction - generations
of characters dying off, politi-
cal facts and sludge. But by the

end of class that day, I'd transi-
tioned through my hatred, and
found myself inexplicably lov-
ing it. Like a book tattoo, it had
to hurt to leave an imprint, and
once that imprint was made,
it became tough to forget. Yet
part of me couldn't comprehend
why I liked it. So many hours of
loathing its existence, wishing
the author nothing but a fiery
libido and an influx of watery
rejection and suddenly I was
turned on, as it were.
The last in the trio to bruise
those bookish family jewels
is the quirkily translated and
anciently filthy - those prehis-
toric texts whose interpreters
go wild with their word choice,
or whose original authors, born
in, say, 446 B.C., still slathered
their works with the most mod-
ernly dirty innuendo. Examples
abound here, from the descrip-
tion of a woman's "high arching
caverns" and Aphrodite's shout
of "Don't vex me bitch!" in "The
Iliad," to Aristophanes's "intes-
tinal insight" into the status of
the gnat's anus as a wind tunnel
"trumpet." Now that's classic lit-
erature, and classy classic litera-
ture to boot.
My point is not that of a liter-
ary hipster. I'm not saying that
because a book is well known
it can't be that dose of magic
you're looking for. I'm simply
suggesting that every once in a
while it's O.K. to put down your
copies of "Lolita" or the sprin-
kle-covered "A Million Little
Pieces," remove your cup and
open yourself to the possibil-
ity of a swift and startling read
from an unthought-of source. Sit
down with a picture book, hate
something into greatness and
remember that if aged wines get
you drunkest, age may have a
similar effect on books.

like this, there
are a certain Lakeshore
collection of
targeted male-protagonist films
that go relatively under the radar,
like "Brooklyn's Finest" and
"Green Zone" last year. This year,
that void was filled by two releas-
es this past weekend - "Limit-
less" and "The Lincoln Lawyer."
In a way, "The Lincoln Law-
yer" is the perfect film for this
time of year. It's a crime drama
and thriller without the flash
and awe that many so-described
films tend to devolve into, and
its quiet nature is reflected by its
focus on the personal develop-
ment of its macho-smooth pro-
tagonist. Therein lies the source
of its success - it doesn't go too
far, but stays within reason to
illuminate the believable life of a
fictional hero.
The charismatic Matthew
McConaughey ("Ghosts of Girl-
friends Past") capably embodies
the slick Mick Haller, a defense
attorney with just as much street
cred as experience. He has no

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com


Despite late slide, next season is
looking bright for Blue

Asat watched the Mihigan
women's basketball team
throw its season away last
Thursday, the irony of the situ-
ation began to creep up on me.
The Wolverines were losing to
an undersized
team from EVERETT
Ypsilanti who COOK
were wearing
green jerseys onskeon
and playing b
some of its
best basketball of the season - on
Saint Patrick's Day. In my mind,
Michigan was not losing to East-
ern Michigan, but to the Luck of
the Irish.
How else could someone
explain what was happening?
As one of the lastteams to miss
the NCAA Tournament, the Wol-
verines were expected to contend
for the WNIT title. The players
seemed to be focused and ready
to go that week in practice, talk-
ing about hangingthe first wom-
en's basketball banner in program
history up in Crisler Arena.
But somehow, some way, I
found myself listening to senior
guard Veronica Hicks after the
game as she described her last
game wearingthe maize and
blue. In a season full of surprises,
this had to be the biggest one.
Michigan started off the sea-
son predicted by no one to finish
in the top three of the Big Ten,
yet it finished third for the first
time since 2001. At one point, the
Wolverines beat three-straight
ranked opponents, which includ-
ed their 2-0 start in conference
play. Perhaps most importantly,
they swept that team down south
for the first time in program his-
tory.
But with the highs came the
lows. Michigan lost to Detroit
Mercy early in the season, and to
Big Ten bottom feeder Minne-
sota twice. The Wolverines' slide
toward the end of the season,
though, is what ended up costing
them a spot in the NCAA Tourna-
ment. In the Big Ten Tournament,
Michigan received a first-round
bye for the first time since 2001,
yet lost to last place Illinois in its
first game of the tournament.
That loss pretty much sealed
the Wolverines' fate, putting
them on the outside looking in
on the NCAA Tournament. The
WNIT would have to be enough,
as Michigan would extend its
10-year absence from the Big
Dance.
Thanks to the Eagles, though,
Michigan's season is officially
caput. The season ended before it
should have, but I, the usual pes-
simist, am not worried. At all.

TODD NEEDLE/Daily
Junior forward Carmen Reynolds will fill a leadrship void left by current senior Veronica Hicks next season.

Michigan graduates only one
senior - Hicks. Granted, that one
senior is a huge one to lose, con-
sidering Hicks is one of just five
Wolverines in program history
with 1,000 points, 200 assists
and 150 steals. Perhaps more
importantly, Hicks was the team's
unquestioned leader and the emo-
tional backbone - every single
player leaned on her for support,
on and off the court.
After Hicks' last game in
Crisler, her post game speech
moved many people to tears,
including her teammates.
"Ronni" leaves the program
having never made an NCAA
Tournament, but the team she
left behind has a great chance to
do so.
Consider how much the Wol-
verines improved this year, even
with their incredible youth.
Then consider how much better
all of those players will be after
another six months of offseason
basketball.
Michigan will return a tal-
ented nucleus of young players
who can only go up from here.
Juniors Courtney Boylan and
Carmen Reynolds will step into
the leadership role that Hicks left
behind, as at one point or another
this season they each carried the
team.
Reynolds was inconsistent
throughout the season, but she
is still atop Michigan's all-time
3-point percentage chart at
43-percent in her career. Boylan

lit a fire under the Wolverines
midway through the season in her
first career start, showing flashes
of brilliance as starting point
guard.
Sophomore guard Jenny Ryan
has the potential to be the Wol-
verines' best all-around player
and even earn All-Big Ten honors
- her only weakness is a sporadic
jump shot. Sophomore guard Nya
Jordan will finally be healthy, and
she will step into to the slasher
role the Wolverines so desperate-
ly needed late in the season when
Jordan missed due to injury.
And 6-foot-4 sophomore guard
Kate Thompson used her height
and wicked jump shot to create
serious mismatches from the
perimeter.
Sophomore center Rachel Shef-
fer developed into a legitimate
offensive threat late in the sea-
son, as she ended up as the Wol-
verines' second-leading scorer.
Sophomore forward Sam Arnold
will most likely remain the Wol-
verines' post player off the bench,
as she can score in bunches from
both the center and forward posi-
tions.
Redshirt freshman Kendra
Seto will also geta chance to play,
as she sat out this year due to
NCAA transfer rules. Seto aver-
aged 10 points per game in her
freshman year at Vermont and
was named one of the Top-20
high school basketball players in
Canada her senior year of high
school.

All of the inexperience, dearth
of height, and poor pre-season
expectations were tied together
by the mad man at the helm -
coach Kevin Borseth. He took
a supremely youngteam and
led Michigan to its first win-
ning record in the Big Ten in 10
years. He might be angry on the
sidelines and seem crazy to the
outsiders, but his players love him
and he knows how to getthe best
out of them.
Obviously, most of this is spec-
ulation, but something tells me
this team is headed in the right
direction.
Nothing confirmed this more
than the courts of the CCRB on
Monday night.
Among the regulars were six
Wolverines, practicing for next
years' campaign less than a week
after their season ended. It was
9:00 p.m. ona weeknight and the
young Michigan players wanted
nothing more than to dominate a
game of pick-up basketball.
Michigan will miss Hicks,
without a doubt, but the team she
left behind has the potential to go
far. Remember, this is a program
that has made it out of the first
round of the NCAA Tournament
just twice. Ever. There have not
been alot of great teams in this
program, but the future is bright
in Crisler.
As long as the Wolverines
don't run into any Saint Patrick's
Day leprechauns, the outlook,
for once, is optimistic.

Burlon - out of the lineup for
both games this past weekend
at Joe Louis Arena - has been

The junior defenseman has

By the time we made it to Neyba,

our directors told us that the bus

Given that his schedule affords little room to repeat a
class - because some courses are not offered on a yearly
basis - there is high pressure to earn satisfactory grades.
Despite its difficulties however, his triple concentration
offers Liu numerous advantages. In particular, Liu believes
it will result in numerous employment or educational
options after graduation.
It also lends him a broad base of knowledge that he can
leverage in interview settings. Liu, an aspiring actuarial
analyst, notes with a good-humored caveat that prospective
employers seem to appreciate his ability to efficiently man-
age three concentrations.

they make, andahow the decisions they make effect all the
human beings around them and their decisions," Berman
said. "It's about network effects between people and deci-

While Berman appreciates the variety afforded by a quan-
titative degree and a qualitative degree, and has learned to
better manage the workload of the respective disciplines,
she professes that dual-school status can be turbulent at
times.
"They're just such different mindsets that sometimes
I have trouble switching right away from coming out of a
theatre class where we're delving into these really intense
scenes, and then sitting down and doing econ or stats can be
kind of tricky," Berman said.
Though potentially restrained in the extent to which she
can explore both disciplines, Berman does not believe that
she is limiting her educational or intellectual growth.
."Until one thing is the only thing you can possibly see
yourself doing, you want to do as much as you humanly can
because all of that feeds into experiences and life," Berman
said.
The Violist as Educator
Another student transcending a single degree from the
Music, Theatre, & Dance School is freshman Dan Brown, a
viola performance major who plans to apply to the Univer-
sity's two-year School of Education program at the end of
his sophomore year. If admitted, Brown will concentrate in
French, complemented by a German minor.
According to Brown, the trend of disappearing symphony
jobs prompted him to reevaluate his career options and con-
sider the School of Education. If joining a symphony should
prove unattainable, he plans to teach French.
"I always knew that music was competitive," Brown said.
"I was fine with that. I'm happy with a competitive edge, and
I'll go for that. But if symphonies are literally disappearing,
there are no jobs available, it doesn't matter how good I am."
Though his heavy course load demands that he also take
classes during the spring semester, Brown said consulting
School of Education advisors has thus far been helpful in
planning his forthcoming semesters.
Potentially problematic for Brown is the scheduling con-
flict between his education courses and, perthe requirements
of his music scholarships, the necessary orchestra class he
must take each semester. He also will not be able totake many
music electives, which he calls his "biggest sacrifice."
But despite any surfacing logistical friction, Brown is con-
fident in his ability to split time between both schools.
"Growing up in high school, you have the public school
and then you have music," Brown said. "When you get here,
it's really no different."

Bwilding the perfect class schedule is an
art. The moment the course guide goes
live, the eight-page paper due tomor-
row takes second priority as students
attempt to craft a four-day weekend with no
classes before 11 a.m.
Within each department, students spread the
word as to what courses to avoid and which to
fit in before graduation. If you must take that
painful pre-requisite, most have an idea who the
best professor is to tough it out with. Students
pick apart and analyze their professors for their
peers - he talks too fast, she makes good jokes,
his readings are interesting - but perhaps the
most vital piece of information for schedule
builders is how their potential professor grades.
The University holds its students to a high
standard. However, according to data obtained
by The Michigan Daily from a Freedom of
Information Act request, there are large dis-
parities in grades across professors and depart-
ments. The data includes the grade distribution
and end-of-the-semester course evaluations of
2,329 professors, lecturers and Graduate Stu-
dent Instructors for the fall 2009 and winter
2010 semesters. In analyzing the information to
determine the easiest and hardest classes, the
Daily excluded courses with less than 15 stu-
dents and omitted courses in which the major-
ity of students received incomplete grades. The
FOIA data excludes information about certain
schools.
If you're longing to graduate with a 4.0 GPA,
the math department is one to avoid. Compared
to the other departments listed in the FOIA data,
in the 2009-2010 academic year, math instruc-
tors gave the lowest combined average grade
to students: a B-. While the math department
appears to be the most difficult at the Univer-
sity, the easiest is LSA's small Aerospace Sci-
ence department, which consists of four courses
where professors give an average grade of an A.
Obsession over grades has been a large fea-
ture of most students' academic lives ever since
high school. Parents, teachers and guidance
counselors alike let us know that if we wanted
to get into top-ranked schools, we were going to
have to prove we deserved admission. Now that

we've made it, it's hard to shake that itch for an A. Maybe
graduate school is on the horizon or you need a presti-
gious internship to make your resume more competitive.
Either way, for most students, the drive to secure a high
GPA continues unceasingly into the college years.
But before you switch your major to Violin Perfor-
mance - another program with an average grade of an
A - it's important to understand why there are these
discrepancies in grades. We all go to the same Univer-
sity: Shouldn't we all be held to the same academic stan-
dards? When an instructor gives an average grade of a C
and another one awards nothing lower than an A+, there
is likely to be an explanation beyond, "my GSI is so evil."
THE 'EASY' COURSES
Jennifer Yim, lecturer and director of the Global Schol-
ars program, could be considered an "easy grader." In the
2009-2010 academic year, she gave an average grade of
an A for her Global Understanding course, which had 28
students total in the fall and winter semesters. Seven stu-
dents received an A+ and 21 received an A. However, she
maintains that her course isn't an easy A.
The course she taught is a highly specialized class
restricted to students in the Global Scholars living-learn-
ing community, which students are eligible to apply for
at the end of their freshman year. Yim said students' pas-
sion for the subject material is reflected in the grades her
students receive.
She addedthat manyGlobal Scholarscourses arehighly
cooperative, with students depending on one another for
their success in the classroom: this class style pressures
students to put in more effort. Furthermore, Yim makes
sure that the requirements for an A are clearly defined.
"The more clear you make your grading expectations
in the class, the better the students tend to do," she said.
Similarly, School of Social Work Assistant Prof. Brian
Perron, who gave 17 A+s, four As and one A-, echoed Yim,
saying that clearly-defined expectations and grading
guidelines that are established and communicated to stu-
dents at the beginning of a course leads to higher student
achievement.
"It is my role and passion to create an atmosphere that
will help students learn the course material and go above
and beyond the course expectations," he said.
He said when grading, he remains as faithful as pos-
sible to the grading criteria he set at the beginning of the
term and works to make sure his system of evaluation is
fair and accurate.
Professor Nilton Renno teaches Geophysical Electro-
magnetics which had 16 students during the last academ-
ic year. Seven earned an A+, seven earned an A and two
received an A-. He said he tries to find problems early in
his students' work and help them overcome those issues
by the end of the semester.
His teacher evaluations show that his efforts are appre-
ciated. All students who filled out evaluations "strongly
agreed" that he was an "excellent teacher." Renno said
students have told him that his class is the best they've
taken while at the University. He added that students
honestly want to do well and are interested in the subject
material in his course, which is why they are so success-
ful.
"Some people think if the professor grades the course
easy, there's a negative connotation," Renno said. "But if
the student meets the requirements, there's no reason to
give them a bad grade."
PE R FOERM A N M AJO RS: EA R F ROM E ASY
Many departments that give the highest average
grades are within the School of Music, Theatre & Dance
School. Included on the list are percussion, opera, piano,

music performance and violin.
Music, Theatre & Dance School is made up of about
1,050 students and 150 faculty members. Many of the
departments require an audition and interview before
acceptance. Unlike LSA students, students who choose
Music, Theatre & Dance School aren't undecided. And
unlike LSA departments, the classes often require more
pre-requisites, are restricted to majors and sometimes
require further auditions, which significantly reduces
the number of non-majors in the courses.
Despite the emphasis on talent and performance,
Music, Theatre & Dance School Registrar Deedee Ulintz
said the importance of grades for students in the school
is "just the same as a student pursuing an academic con-
centration."
"I would say a ton of these studentsare going on to
grad school," she said. "And even though things are
audition-based, you still need a minimum GPA for any
school to even show up."
Music;Theatre & Dance School sophomore Roberto
Arundale hopes one day to have an orchestra or teaching
job. He agrees that getting good grades is important, but
says it ultimately comes down to talent.
"I have a 3.5. I'll be happy and that'll be just fine," he
said. "It's more important how well you play."
Even though students who take percussion classes
get higher grades on average than University students
taking other courses-100 percent of students who took
percussion classes received at least an A- compared to
31 percent of students taking math classes - it is by no
means easy to major in a performing art.
"I try to do three to four hours a day of solo practice,"
Arundale said. "Others do more and others do less."
THE HARD COURSES
Courses in the math department are anathema to stu-
dents who wish to graduate with a 4.0. On a list of the
10 University instructors who gave the lowest average
grades during the 2009-2010 school year, eight instruc-
tors from the math department are featured. The math
department's aggregate average grade is a B-.
The difficultly of math classes is one reason LSA
freshman Salvatore Aiello recently dropped his Calcu-
lus II class. He was taking the course as a pre-requisite
for his biology major and said he isn't surprised that the
math department gives out the lowest average grades.
After talking with his adviser, Aiello decided that a bet-
ter path would be to finish the course at a college near
his hometown over the summer.
"It was extremely difficult," Aiello said. "Combined
with my first exam score and how I felt in the class, I
didn't think I could raise my score, and it just wasn't
working out."
Stephen DeBacker, math professor and director of
undergraduate studies, says "it's because there has been
no grade inflation" that math department grades tend to
be low.
"I can't speak for the whole department, but my
thinking is grades should mean something," he said. "If
you're giving 50, 60, 40 percent of the people As, then
the A loses its meaning. The A is supposed to stand for
excellence. I also think you honestly have to evaluate the
students so they understand how they stand in life."
Despite the low grades, many of the instructors have
positive teacher evaluations GSI Tomoki Ohsawa gave
an average grade of a C during the 2009-2010 academ-
ic year, yet in 35 evaluations, on average, his students
"strongly:agreed" that he was an "excellent teacher."
The same trend was found with other math GSIs and
lecturers.
"Overall, mathematics work really, really, really hard
to make sure its Grad Student Instructors are good

teachers," DeBacker said. "They have to go through all
the training, and then they get followed up during their
first semester of teaching, and if there are any prob-
lems with that they get followed for another semes-
ter. There's constant evaluation during their initial
teaching periods."
Though it's not best for GPAs, the math
department's techniques seem to be working.
"There are studies that show that kids who
learn calculus at the University of Michi-
gan learn it better than at other college
that has been similarly tested," DeBacker
said.
Even Aiello said, "the way Michigan
teaches its calc is very different than
any way I've ever experienced it."
DO GRADES MATTER?
For Aiello, grades are an impor-
tant indicator of his academic
success and will play a large role
in his future.
"Grades are very impor-
tant," Aiello said. "I'm hope-
fully going to med school, and
grades have a huge influence in MUSEU
that."
Perron said the importance
of grades fluctuates between
disciplines and years in col-
lege. He understands how they
can be important to an under- PROS
graduate's future plans, but
in graduate programs like the
School of Social Work, grades
have a different meaning. He
said it's his duty to motivate
his students "to look beyond
the grading system so they learn
information and skills to support
their success."
"As educators we need to be
responsive to what students need to
excel in their careers, namely a high-
quality education," he said.
To DeBacker, grades are a measure
of how well students learn the material.
When grades are reduced to
only A's, he wonders, "why
have grades?" TOP 10 HA
In regard to a universal
University standard, Perron by average Grad
believes the University "should I Moth 2 Mole(
be providing the highest qual- 6 Accounting 71
ity education as possible."
"Grades are a part of the
process, but a distribution of THE BREAKS
grades is not necessarily an
indicator of educational qual- Department of M
ity," he said.
WHAT THE DATA SAYSCr
It's hard to determine what
constitutes a universally j
"easy" or "hard" class. Thef
diverse strengths of University
students ensure that a broad
range of academic talents is
represented. While one stu-
dent may struggle in English
