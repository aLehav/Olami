More than 40 Ann Arbor 
residents gathered for food 
and drink at the home of 
Ann and Steve Arbaugh on 
Thursday night in support of 
former journalist Jen Eyer’s 
candidacy for the Ward 4 
city council position in Ann 
Arbor. 
Those 
in 
attendance 
included Mayor Christopher 
Taylor; state Sen. Jeff Irwin, 
D-Ann Arbor; Washtenaw 
County 
Commissioner 
Katie 
Scott, 
D-District 
9; and former state Sen. 
Mitch Irwin. Former City 
Councilmembers 
Kirk 
Westphal, D-Ward 2; Margie 
Teall, D-Ward 4; Graydon 
Krapohl, D-Ward 4; and 
Joan Lowenstein, D-Ward 2, 
were also present. 
During the event, Eyer 
said she wanted to continue 
working in public service 
after 
her 
time 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Commissioners. 
After reflecting on where 
she could make the most 
difference, Eyer explained 
she was compelled to serve 

at the local level, which she 
believes is often overlooked.
To Eyer, one of the most 
important issues in the city 
is a housing crisis, which she 
said she believes is largely 
due to an affordable housing 
shortage. 
“We have 80,000 people 
who commute into our city 
every day, and we are a city 
of 120,000 people,” Eyer 
said. “Our population grows 
75 percent every single day. 
How many of those people 
would like to live here? I 
would guess quite a few.”
Eyer said she would like to 
address the city’s structural 
budget deficit. In addition, 
she said she wants to see the 
city pursue more aggressive 
action to address what she 
called the “existential threat 
of climate change.”
“I don’t know about you, 
but I feel like Ann Arbor 
should be a leader among 
cities when it comes to 
climate action,” Eyer said. 
“And we are so far from that 
goal right now that we can’t 
even see it. We are not doing 
the work.”

University 
of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
announced 
a 
$50-million 
increase 
in 
funding 
for 
the 
Center 
for 
Academic 
Innovation, the creation of 
the Firearm Injury Prevention 
Research Initiative and a new 
fund dedicated to achieving 

climate neutrality to a crowd 
of more than 200 faculty, staff 
and students at the annual 
Leadership 
Breakfast 
in 
the Ross School of Business 
Thursday morning. 
The funding for the Center for 
Academic Innovation, Schlissel 
said, would support the center 
as they develop strategies to 
make academic knowledge more 
accessible through technology 
and research. 

According to Schlissel, the 
funds will be distributed over 
the course of five years, with 
$10 million given to the center 
every year. 
“Our 
innovations 
have 
already personalized learning 
to 
students 
from 
diverse 
backgrounds, 
they 
have 
identified 
potential 
biases 
in 
testing 
and 
empowered 
learners to make data-driven 
choices about how they allocate 

their studying time,” Schlissel 
said. 
“They’re 
leveling 
the 
playing field and identifying 
opportunities 
that 
were 
previously unseen.” 
The first iteration of the 
center, the Office of Digital 
Education and Innovation, was 
founded in 2014 to bridge the 
gaps between digital platforms 
and academic learning.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

In 
a 
packed 
Michigan 
Theater Thursday evening, 
students gathered for a Penny 
Stamps lecture featuring the 
man behind many of the hats 
displayed in fashion exhibits 
and donned by celebrities: 
Stephen Jones.
Stephen 
Jones 
is 
the 

fashion 
world’s 
leading 
milliner, or hatmaker. Having 
made a name for himself 
in the 1970s in London, 
Jones was a student of Saint 
Martin’s 
School 
of 
Art 
during the day and regularly 
attend the Blitz nightclub 
in the evenings, where he 
and his friends would wear 
outrageous outfits. By 1980, 
Jones had opened up his 
own store in Covent Garden. 

Forty years later, Jones still 
attracts the biggest names 
in the industry, crafting hats 
for celebrities including Lady 
Gaga, Rihanna, Madonna and 
Meghan Markle.
The lecture was hosted by 
the School of Art & Design as 
the first event in their yearly 
Penny Stamps Speaker Series.
Onstage, several different 
headpieces were displayed, 
from berets and headbands 

to more elaborate headpieces. 
Art & Design senior Sofia 
Zertuche 
found 
that 
the 
displays added an important 
visual element to the lecture.
“Usually we don’t have 
things 
onstage,” 
Zetruche 
said. 
“Having 
the 
hats 
onstage, 
it 
provides 
an 
interesting outlook on what 
the show is about.” 

Earlier this year, more than 
250 parking spots for hospital 
employees were converted to 
patient-only spaces, making it 
challenging for hospital staff to 
find parking and get to work on 
time. At the Board of Regents 
meeting on Sept. 18, dozens of 
nurses showed up wearing red 
shirts holding signs that read 
“Schlissel: Fix Parking Now!” 
At that same Regents meeting, 
the board approved a new $920 
million hospital.
Mary Masson, spokesperson 
for Michigan Medicine, wrote 
in an email to The Daily that the 
University of Michigan has been 
aware of parking concerns for 
a while now, for both patients 
and employees. Masson said in 
order to try to create a better 
experience 
for 
patients 
and 
their families, they converted 
employee 
spaces 
to 
patient 
spaces.
“We recognize parking is 
currently a challenge for our 
employees and our patients,” 
Masson wrote.

When 
he 
arrived 
at 
the 
University of Michigan in 1962, 
Cazzie 
Russell 
didn’t 
expect 
to 
become 
engraved 
in 
the 
history of Michigan Basketball. 
Assistant coaches James Skala 
and Tom Jorgensen came to his 
neighborhood high school in the 
south side of Chicago to recruit him 
to the Michigan basketball team, 
telling him he would be guaranteed 
to play if he came to the University. 
Russell later came to the 
University 
for 
a 
visit 
before 
committing for basketball. During 
his visit, Coach Skala attempted to 
take him on a tour of Yost Arena 
to woo him. Skala lost the keys 
that day, so the pair couldn’t get 
into the arena. Russell committed 
regardless. 
This weekend, Russell will 
be coming back in honor of the 
homecoming game. 
“I ended up coming to Michigan, 
which was a real blessing because I 
was told by Coach Skala, he said, 
‘If you come to Michigan you can 
play.’ I enjoyed his visit and enjoyed 
his honesty,” Russell said.

The story behind Detroit’s 
cornerback pipeline to 
Michigan that’s berthed 
numerous stars.

 » Page 4 and 5B


Cuban-inspired street food 
restaurant Frita Batidos opened 
in Detroit Wednesday, marking 
their second location since the 
restaurant opened in Ann Arbor 
in 2010. Located downtown, the 
business is situated between the 
Fox Theatre and the Fillmore 
on West Columbia Street. Frita 
Batidos is the first of many 
businesses expected to open 
in the new Columbia Street 
development in District Detroit 
in the near future.
The 
restaurant’s 
“fritas,” 
Cuban-style burgers and fries, 
and “batidos,” tropical fruit 
milkshakes, 
have 
garnered 
love and appreciation from 
University of Michigan students, 
some of whom were excited to 
hear about the new location in 

downtown Detroit.
LSA senior Peyton Sternfeld 
grew up in metro Detroit and 
recounted hearing about the new 
location from her mother, who 
saw the announcement in their 
local paper. Sternfeld praised 
the restaurant for its ability to 
accommodate her food allergies 
and expressed her excitement 
about the introduction of Frita 
Batidos to Detroit.
“I think it’s great that (Frita 
Batidos is) expanding. … There’s 
so many fun and new restaurants 
coming up in Detroit,” Sternfeld 
said. Frita Batidos is “affordable 
and it’s great for most people 
to have a fun, different food 
option.”
Frita Batidos is known for 
its customizable options, and 
the Detroit location will be 
no different. From black bean 

burgers topped with fried eggs 
and avocado spread to churros 
dusted with cinnamon and 
sugar, the menu in Detroit will 
be similar to the Ann Arbor 
original. Detroit’s location also 
boasts a full bar and seasonal 
drink options for customers.
Eve Aronoff is the chef and 
owner of Frita Batidos and 
came up with the idea for the 
Cuban-infused restaurant based 
on her childhood experiences 
visiting her grandmother in 
Miami, as well as her love for the 
Latinx culture. Frita Batidos’s 
Detroit location opened after 
almost a decade of high demand 
and praises from the local 
community.
Aronoff noted the positive 
customer reception of the new 
location’s opening thus far, 
especially because of the Detroit 
natives who now feel like 
Frita Batidos is closer to 
home.
“It’s going great and 
better than we could have 
imagined, just super warm 
reception from people in 
the neighborhood, and the 
city, and people coming out 
from Ann Arbor,” Aronoff 
said. “We didn’t realize how 
many people used to come to 
Ann Arbor from Detroit that 
now are really happy that 
we’re closer to them, so that 
felt really good.”
Business 
sophomore 
Owen 
Hill 
noted 
that 
because the restaurant does 
not solely imitate Cuban 
cuisine, 
there 
is 
more 
opportunity for Aronoff and 
her team to try out different 
recipes and create unique 
dishes for patrons.
“It’ll be a completely 
different vibe in Detroit, 
obviously, because of the 
location, but also because 
it’s not taken from another 
culture 
concretely 
and 
moved here,” Hill said. “It’s 

just the creator’s imagination, 
which opens up a lot of different 
avenues for her to go down when 
you open it in Detroit.”
In 
its 
nine 
years, 
Frita 
Batidos has gained national 
recognition 
and 
earned 
its 
place as Ann Arbor’s go-to 
spot, receiving glowing reviews 
from 
publications 
including 
The New York Times, National 
Geographic and USA Today. The 
Daily has named Frita Batidos 
the “Best Burger” in their annual 
“Best of Ann Arbor” series every 
year since 2014. 
Aronoff 
and 
her 
team 
gravitated toward opening a 
location in Detroit “because of 
the unique character and energy 
of the city — not just in recent 
years, but through its rich and 
complex history” according to 
the restaurant website. Over 
the past four years, the Frita 
Batidos team came close to 
opening locations in Detroit, but 
ultimately signed their lease for 
the Columbia Street location a 
year and a half ago. 
LSA sophomore Courtney 
Fortin also noted the advantages 
of bringing Frita Batidos to 
Detroit as the city continues 
to develop and establish new 
homes and businesses. Fortin 
also 
explained 
that 
while 
young people go to Detroit for 
a sporting event or concert, 
they will be drawn to a unique 
restaurant 
atmosphere 
as 
opposed 
to 
typical 
chain 
restaurants.
“It’s good to have a cultural 
identity 
for 
a 
restaurant, 
and then put it in a place like 
Detroit,” Fortin said. “A lot of 
people go to Detroit to eat, and 
they don’t want to see a bunch 
of chain restaurants … I feel like 
Detroit is the right environment 
for (Frita Batidos) to be in.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
I’m trying to be strong even though I don’t feel strong. I’m so 
weak. I’m tired. But I’m not going to quit fighting for my son as long as 
his heart is beating. I will be fighting for him to my last breath. And I 
said, whatever happens, it’s in God’s hands. If God takes my son while 
he’s on life support, you know, we’ll make peace with it, but I’ll never 
have peace with knowing that I consented to pulling the plug on my son 
when he’s still here.”

Sarah Jones, mother of 14-year old Bobby Reyes, who was placed on life suppot after he went into cardiac arrest following an 
asthma attack

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look 
at one of this week’s stories. This week, Public Policy junior 
Samantha Della Fera coordinated an oral history of The Michigan 
Daily.

“The lede was a profile on The Daily itself. We interview a bunch of 
alumni, spanning back all the way to the ‘50s, so back when there was 
still a staff person that was in charge of The Daily and it wasn’t just 
student-run. We interviewed a lot of high profile people that wrote 
for The Daily and got their start here, like Adam Schefter, who is the 
NFL insider for ESPN. He was a sports editor here. Philip Power of the 
Power Center was also an editor here, so we got to talk to a lot of cool 
people who are connected to both Michigan history and the history of 
The Daily.”

The lecture began with a 
short instructional video on the 
steps of creating a hat.
Jones 
discussed 
how 
throughout his time in boarding 
school, he wasn’t sure exactly 
what he wanted to do — all he 
knew was that he wanted it to 
be something exciting. He also 
recalled how his family always 
communicated via art, which 
is why he decided to apply 
to fashion school in London. 
Upon arriving at the school, 
Jones said he saw two distinct 
cliques.
“My first day of college I 
walked into this room … on the 
left-hand side, there were all 
these very chic, elegant girls, 
all wearing beige cashmere and 
smoking cigarettes,” Jones said. 
“And then on the right-hand 
side of the room, there were a 
few, some miserable fucking 
punks … and I thought, ‘I’m 
either going to go left or going 
to go right. I’m either going to 
have to wear beige cashmere, 
and or I’m going to wear cheap 
vinyl.’ I went to the cheap vinyl 
side and never looked back.”

As a student at St. Martin’s 
School of Art, Jones got an 
internship at a couture shop 
working 
for 
the 
tailoring 
department. While Jones said 
his main responsibility was 
going on coffee runs, he advised 
students to take advantage 
of knowledge gained during 
internships.
“Keep your eyes open … when 
you are interns,” Jones said. “It 
doesn’t matter what you do, 
it matters what you observe 
which is the most fascinating 
thing. And I observed the 
politics of the couture house.”
It was during this internship 
that 
he 
became 
fascinated 
by the millinery department 
within the couture shop. Jones 
asked his boss to transfer to 
the millinery department, even 
though he had never created 
a hat before. He was given a 
weekend to produce a hat and 
to present it to the head of the 
department. This left Jones 
scouring for materials at home 
in order to create a pillbox hat.
“So, I got an old box of 
cereal and took the cardboard 
from that and some glue, and 
I begged my sister for some 
fabric, and she gave me an old 
blouse,” Jones said. 
Jones’s 
millinery 
career 

started picking up as he began 
spending his nights at the 
Blitz nightclub and premiering 
his hats on the fashion scene. 
By 1980, he had dropped out 
of art school and opened his 
own millinery. Jones credits 
his success to his successful 
networking, 
especially 
befriending Jasper Conran, a 
fellow fashion designer. Jones 
recalled how, one day, Conran 
told him that he had a new 
client opportunity for him.
“So, I went to his showroom 
and I opened the door and 
in the fitting room… to my 
complete 
amazement 
[was] 
Princess Diana, Princess of 
Whales,” Jones said. “And then 
I said, ‘Oh, where’s Jasper?’ and 
I heard an ‘I’m here’ and Jasper 
suddenly appeared from under 
the ballgown.”
Jones said he works with 
large scale couture shops such 
as Dior and Marc Jacobs, but 
he also works with individual 
celebrities. The slideshow he 
displayed showed all of his 
hat creations on the heads of 
Madonna, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, 
Janelle Monae, Meghan Markle 
and Amal Clooney.

In 2016, it was renamed 
the 
Center 
for 
Academic 
Innovation 
and 
became 
a 
presidential 
initiative, 
allowing it to expand its 
offerings and reach out to 
more students. 
Currently, 
the 
center 
runs 
about 
160 
Massive 
Open 
Online 
Courses 
to 
make a University education 
accessible to students online. 
The 
MOOCs 
are 
courses 
designed by University faculty 
that are meant to be taken 
online by anyone interested in 
learning more about a specific 
subject.
Schlissel also introduced 
the Firearm Injury Prevention 
Research Initiative, a new 
program that aims to harness 
the 
University’s 
research 
capabilities to advocate for 
safer gun use across the 
country. Schlissel stressed the 
program is not interested in 
debating Second Amendment 
rights or introducing gun 
control measures, but instead 
is focused on collecting data 
to prevent gun deaths through 
safer and smarter use. 
“I 
trust 
the 
initiative 
to engage the breadth of 
expertise across the University 
of Michigan with input from 
non-academic 
stakeholders 
to generate knowledge and 
advanced solutions that will 
decrease firearm injury in 
the United States,” Schlissel 
said. “The focus is not on gun 
control, but rather on injury 
prevention.”
During the Q&A session 
that took place after the 
speech, an attendee asked 
Schlissel to elaborate on how 
firearm 
injury 
prevention 
is not a form of gun control. 
Schlissel responded by noting 
that the new initiative is only 
focused on the ways research 
can help prevent injury and is 
not politically affiliated in any 
way. 
“The challenges around the 
politically contentious debate 
over 
interpretation 
of 
the 
Second Amendment actually 
seem to paralyze our country 
from dealing with the health 
crisis,” Schlissel said. “So, 
the notion is, it’s not that I 

don’t think people should be 
discussing 
and 
considering 
gun control, but it’s not our 
research initiative.”
During 
his 
speech, 
Schlissel 
also 
touched 
on 
current 
Diversity, 
Equity 
and 
Inclusion 
plans 
that 
will 
continue 
throughout 
the semester. The five-year 
DEI plan — the University’s 
program to increase diversity 
in all sectors of the institution 
— is currently in its fourth 
year. Schlissel said he plans 
to 
work 
with 
University 
administrators, faculty and 
students to continue these 
efforts even after the fifth 
year finishes. 
“Thanks to the dedication 
and hard work of people of 
people all across our campus 
… the values we share are 
becoming ingrained deeply in 
the content of our mission as 
a public university,” Schlissel 
said. 
LSA sophomore Julianna 
Collado, 
the 
external 
director of La Casa, a student 
organization 
representing 
Latinx students and faculty 
at the University, attended 
the 
Leadership 
Breakfast 
alongside 
three 
other 
members of the organization. 
Collado said she and other 
representatives from La Casa 
wanted to hear Schlissel’s 
plans for expanding current 
DEI projects. 
“I 
was 
particularly 
interested 
in 
the 
DEI 
initiatives that are happening 
and 
how 
that 
work 
will 
continue 
after 
the 
five-
year plan,” Collado said. “It 
was interesting to see what 
was 
highlighted, 
but 
also 
acknowledging that there is 
still a lot of work that needs to 
be done.”
In the Q&A session, Craig 
Reynolds, 
the 
executive 
director 
of 
the 
Office 
of 
Research 
and 
Sponsored 
Projects, 
asked 
Schlissel 
how the University plans to 
respond to current policies 
that make it difficult for 
academics in other countries 
to do research in the United 
States. 
“A challenge that we face is in 
the rhetoric in policy changes 
coming out of Washington in 
respect to foreign influence 
on research,” Reynolds said. 

“One of the hallmarks of a 
strong university is our ability 
to attract students and faculty 
and post-docs from across the 
world, either as collaborators 
are 
as 
members 
of 
our 
community.”
Schlissel emphasized the 
University’s commitment to 
fostering 
an 
international 
and diverse student body and 
faculty, and said the University 
would do the most it could to 
continue attracting students 
from around the world. 
“We are a global university, 
and that means being open to 
collaborations, 
educational 
efforts, global travel in all 
parts of the world,” Schlissel 
said. “Twenty percent of all 
Michigan faculty were not 
born in the United States. 
Our 
talented, 
hardworking 
students 
in 
this 
year’s 
freshman class come from 68 
countries around the globe. 
We’re a global university, and 
that’s inextricably linked to 
our excellence.”
Other topics discussed at 
the 
Leadership 
Breakfast 
included 
the 
Commission 
on Carbon Neutrality, the 
Ideas Lab at the Biosciences 
Initiative and the retirement 
of Vice President of Student 
LifeE. Royster Harper, among 
others. 
Schlissel also announced 
that an anonymous donor 
recently 
donated 
several 
million 
dollars 
to 
the 
University to fund projects 
that will help the campus 
achieve 
carbon 
neutrality. 
Schlissel said he asked the 
Graham 
Sustainability 
Institute to set up a fund with 
the money that will be used 
by faculty toward developing 
carbon-neutral strategies. 
Schlissel 
mentioned 
that 
the 
University 
recently 
joined the University Climate 
Change Coalition, a group 
of North American research 
universities that help their 
campuses 
and 
surrounding 
communities 
reach 
their 
climate goals. 
“The 
problem 
of 
global 
climate change is far too big for 
any one institution to solve,” 
Schlissel said. “Collaboration 
and engagement are key to 
creating real, lasting solutions 
that will benefit our society.”

Eyer previously worked at 
MLive and the Ann Arbor News. 
After leaving MLive in 2016, 
Eyer replaced Conan Smith on 
the Washtenaw County Board 
of Commissioners. Smith left 
to pursue a position in the 
county’s Office of Community 
and Economic Development, and 
Eyer served the remainder of the 
term. 
Following 
an 
unsuccessful 
write-in campaign to continue 
in that position, Eyer became a 
partner at Vanguard, a Michigan 
public relations firm representing 
organizations in the fields of 
education, labor and advocacy. 

According to Eyer, she is 
running 
because 
she 
wants 
to reshape how the council 
approaches issues in the city. 
“When I look at our current 
City Council, I’m frustrated … 
because I see a lot of ‘no’ when 
ideas come to the table, and I 
don’t see a lot of solutions being 
put forth,” Eyer said. “I don’t 
think that’s leadership, and I 
think that has to change.”
Ginny Rogers, Ann Arbor 
resident 
and 
a 
member 
of 
the Citizens’ Climate Lobby, 
explained she attended the event 
hoping to learn more about Eyer’s 
campaign, as she is attracted 
to Eyer’s stances on affordable 
housing and climate action. 
“Seeing 
what 
she’s 
said 
on 
social 
media 
about 
the 

importance of those issues, I’m 
just really interested in Jen’s 
campaign and what she can do to 
address those issues in the city,” 
Rogers said. “I just want to hear 
more details of what she thinks 
and what she’s hoping to do.”
Jenna Jarjoura, a Community 
High School student, helped sign 
in guests at the door. Jarjoura 
explained she wanted to help 
with the campaign because she 
has known Eyer since befriending 
Eyer’s daughter in kindergarten. 
“Every time I’ve gone over 
to her house, she’s always made 
sure I’ve had everything I needed 
from a very young age all the way 
until now,” Jarjoura said.

“Recent 
changes 
have 
already made parking easier for 
patients: in August we created 
more than 250 spaces for patient 
parking because patients were 
missing or late to appointments, 
or just arriving quite stressed 
out by the parking process.”
Leah Karr, a nurse at Mott’s 
Children’s Hospital, said she 
understood the need for more 
patient parking, as she has a 
child who is a frequent patient 
at Mott. However, Karr said 
the converted parking spots 
disproportionately 
affected 
nurses and other direct bedside 
employees and can put them in 
dangerous situations if their 
shifts end late at night. 
“I also have a son that has 
a chronic medical condition, 
and I spend a bit of time at 
the hospital as a parent as 
well, so there definitely was a 
very strong need for increased 
patient and visitor parking at 
the hospital hands down, I do 
not disagree with that,” Karr 
said. “However, the solution 
that they came up with was 
to maintain that top level of 
parking — the gold parking 
— and cut the blue parking, 
which really affects a lot of 
direct bedside employees. And 
then, so they’re forced to go to 
outline lots, which would be 
OK, except there is not reliable 
and 
safe 
transportation 
to 
get the employees to work on 
time. The shuttles do not run 
frequently enough and many of 
the lots are not well lit, and so 
you’re asking them to go back 
out to their cars late at night. 

It’s a problem.”
A University of Michigan 
graduate and current registered 
nurse at the University of 
Michigan Hospital has asked to 
remain anonymous to protect 
her job. She will be referred to 
as Nurse 1. 
Nurse 1 said she can attest 
to struggling to find parking 
as a hospital employee. She 
expressed that she has been 
late to work as a result of these 
difficulties and feels like the 
University doesn’t prioritize the 
needs of those working in often 
undervalued hospital positions, 
such as nurses and clerks.
“Parking is a daily hassle,” 
Nurse 1 said. “In the first two 
months of work, I was late 
twice because of it. It comes 
up almost daily on my unit as 
it being an issue. That being 
said, it’s a problem for everyone, 
patients included. The solutions 
that they’ve come up with 
don’t solve anything though, 
and a lot of times it feels like 
the critical employees are put 
on the back burner when they 
make decisions. Without us 
though, you have no functional 
organization.”
Masson 
said 
Michigan 
Medicine has heard the nursing 
union’s concerns, and that a 
new parking lot will open in the 
fall of 2020.
“We 
also 
have 
listened 
to 
staff 
and 
have 
made 
improvements: 
adding 
more 
buses, 
more 
direct 
express 
routes and more low-cost and 
free remote parking spaces with 
shuttle service for employees,” 
Masson wrote. “A new garage 
for employees on Wall Street is 
under construction and opens 
in fall 2020 with more than 

1,000 parking spots.”
Masson 
noted 
the 
new 
12-story 
hospital, 
that 
is 
supposed to open in 2024, 
will help alleviate the parking 
problems overall. 
LSA junior Rayna Shamah 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
nurses 
in 
a 
hospital 
environment. She cited her 
own personal experience as a 
patient, saying the nurses made 
her feel the most cared for. 
“When I was in the hospital, 
nurses were the figures that 
provided hands on support and 
helped me get through my time 
there,” Shamah said. “They 
kind of personalized the whole 
experience and allowed me to 
feel cared for, and that they 
actually wanted to help me. 
I wasn’t just another person 
coming through the hospital 
that they needed to take care 
of.”
Shamah said the University 
should realize how important 
nurses are and prioritize their 
safety as well. 
“I feel like it makes them 
feel undervalued when they’re 
not 
given 
parking 
spaces,” 
Shamah said “Which makes 
them late for work and makes 
them miss out on patient care, 
which could be very vital for 
the patient. The patient always 
comes first, and the University 
should know that, and care 
about their nurses’ safety and 
well being.”
Ultimately, Karr said she 
loves her job, and she just wants 
to be able to do the best she can. 
“I love being a nurse, I love 
what I do,” Karr said, “and I 
just want my colleagues to get 
to and from the hospital 24/7 
safely.”

“To come visit me and try to 
get me to go to Michigan was a 
fond memory of people taking 
interest in you as a person.”
Russell would go on to set 
the school’s record for single-
season scoring as a sophomore, 
breaking it as a junior and again 
as a senior, becoming a three-
time All-American and one of 
the greatest players in Michigan 
basketball history. 
After 
his 
time 
at 
the 
University, Cazzie went on to 
play for five National Basketball 
Association 
teams 
including 
the New York Knicks and the 
Los Angeles Lakers. He earned 
an NBA championship and was 
named an NBA All-Star player. 
From his time at the University, 
he was the National College 
Player of the Year of 1966 and 
had his jersey number 33 retired 
from the team.
“I am a part of history,” 
Russell said. “They have blessed 
me by retiring my number.”
Martin Vloet, founder of 
Michigan Stadium Products, 
invited Russell back to campus 
in honor of the launch of his 
latest product, a pen made from 
wood from the arena where he 
used to play. Vloet came upon 
the original redwood bench 
seats at The Big House, which 
were installed in 1927, during 
the repurposing of the stadium 
in 2010. The redwood seats 
were going to go waste. As a fan, 
Vloet said he couldn’t sit by and 
let this happen.
“When I saw what was 
bound for the dump, I figured 
someone’s gotta save this … I 
felt like I had to take some of it 
with me,” Vloet said. “I wanted 
something to maintain that 
connection … I’ve had a passion 
for Michigan sports for a long 
time.” 
He salvaged the bit of wood he 
could and turned it into multiple 
limited-edition products to sell 
to fans who wanted to have a 
piece of Michigan history with 
them. Once the University had 
licensed 
and 
authenticated 
the wood, Vloet turned it into 
pens, bottle openers, cufflinks, 
pendants and bracelets. He 
said what makes his product 
special is the limited amount of 
material to use, and therefore, 
an exclusive amount of product 
he can sell.
“It’s a piece of Michigan 
Stadium history, which is really 
nice because it’s something 
even donors who are giving 
tens of millions of dollars can’t 
find somewhere else,” Vloet 
said. “Really just something for 
Michigan fans to connect with 
and to hold on to. The material 
is so limited that we wanted to 

reflect that in a product.”
In early 2019, Vloet decided 
to 
move 
into 
basketball-
inspired products to appeal to 
a wider Michigan fan base. He 
found the final few boards of 
the original hardwood floors 
of the Crisler Arena that had 
been installed in 1967. The 
Crisler Center has been dubbed 
“The House that Cazzie Built” 
after he led the team to victory 
at the Big Ten Conference 
championship three years in a 
row. Though he never played 
in the arena, Russell grew the 
Michigan fanbase beyond the 
limits of the Yost Field House, 
where he originally played.
“We wanted to tie it to the 
Crisler,” Vloet said. “There 
is so little of it (Yost Field 
House) that we wanted to try 
and attach it to the history of 
Crisler Arena, so on a whim 
I looked up Cazzie Russell. I 
wanted something that went 
all the way back in history, 
the same as the flooring did 
and I sent a couple of letters to 
Cazzie (and said) we wanted to 
build something on the history 
of the program.”
The wood floor of the original 
Crisler Center was salvaged and 
turned into a dedication wall 
inside of the current Crisler 
Center. The remaining few feet 
of wood saved by Vloet will be 
turned into 266 limited edition 
pens to commemorate Russell’s 
legacy at the University and on 
the team.
“I think (the pens are) a nice 
tribute to history,” Russell said. 
“I am glad and humble about 
that. I think I also have gotten 
some wood from the two arenas 
that have sent to me: the floor 
from Yost and a piece from the 
renovation of Crisler. When I 
walk in (the Crisler arena) and 
get on the escalator and went 
up there I almost cried because 
when you go up there and you 
look at that, that really reminds 
me of coming to Michigan in 
1962.” 
Russell 
calls 
himself 
a 
Michigan man and is looking 
forward to his return to campus.
“I am a Michigan man,” 
Russell 
said. 
“I 
went 
to 
Michigan. I am a part of history. 
I want to be there for the 
reunion … I am truly grateful 
for the opportunity to come 
back to see everyone and to be 
involved in the homecoming 
atmosphere.”
Russell discussed the story 
behind the famous picture of 
him standing in the construction 
site of Crisler Center. He said 
when the picture was taken, the 
team had just finished two good 
years for Michigan basketball 
and were hoping to play in 
the new arena senior year. 
Something went wrong with 
the roof so Russell didn’t get to 
play in it while at Michigan, but 

he did get the chance as a rookie 
for the Knicks. 
“I took a picture in the first 
Crisler Arena hoping to play 
there,” Russell said. “ ... I played 
in it a year later as a rookie for 
the Knicks … and the people 
were so wonderful, they gave 
me a five minute standing 
ovation; sometimes I wish I can 
go back and replay that because 
it lets you know how blessed 
you are to be a part of history. 
It really is a great feeling … to 
say, ‘Thank you for your years of 
playing and your dedication to 
making Michigan good.’” 
Russell said Ann Arbor has 
changed a lot since he played. 
He said there used to be nothing 
but train tracks where the 
Crisler Center is located. 
“I came to Michigan in 1962 
when a lot of the stuff that is 
built now was not built,” Russell 
said. “I am excited about it. 
Ann Arbor is somewhere very 
special because when I look 
back over what has happened in 
and around Yost, it was nothing 
but train tracks over there … 
I’ve been blessed to be 75 where 
I can enjoy that and look back 
over it.”
LSA junior William Rieck, an 
avid Michigan basketball fan, 
appreciates Michigan Stadium 
Product’s mission and devotion 
to history.
“I think it’s awesome,” Rieck 
said. “Cazzie’s legacy in Ann 
Arbor is still felt in the program 
today, and repurposing Crisler’s 
old hardwood is a great way 
to remember the past and 
get excited for the future of 
Michigan Basketball.”
Vloet said the next step in the 
expansion of his business is the 
move into hockey with acquired 
wood benches from Yost Field 
House.
“I want to find some new 
avenues, and some people like 
sports, and Michigan Stadium is 
a temple of college football and I 
look forward to expanding a bit 
and looking to do more,” Vloet 
said. “I picked up the original 
seats from Yost, so I have two or 
three long bench seats.”
During Russell’s visit, he 
will be doing a public signing 
session and tailgate, in addition 
to reuniting with his teammates 
of 1964 and 1965. He said they 
are all now between the ages of 
75 and 80. 
Russel said he is very excited 
to meet with new basketball 
coach 
Juwan 
Howard 
and 
watch the Iowa game from a box 
on Saturday. 
“I am very, very grateful 
God gave me a chance to play 
for Michigan and I got to do 
something to help people enjoy 
winning because I am a tough 
loser,” Russell said. “I don’t like 
losing. But it was a real pleasure 
for me to play for Michigan and 
I hope they feel the same way.”

O

n March 12, one of the 
greatest — if not the 
greatest — scandals in 
academia was unceremoniously 
unveiled to the world after a 
federal indictment, confirming 
a 
suspicion 
many 
people 
had regarding the American 
college system. Despite their 
championing of merit, selective 
colleges 
at 
their 
core 
are 
subservient 
to 
corruption, 
privilege and wealth. At the 
time, 50 people were implicated 
in the scandal ranging from 
coaches, college prep executives 
and actors. Now, the fallout 
is finally being seen, and it’s a 
slap in the face in the name of 
justice. 
Felicity 
Huffman 
paid 
$15,000 
to 
artificially 
alter 
her 
daughter’s 
SAT 
score. 
Undoubtedly, her actions are 
morally abhorrent. Thousands 
of students every year dedicate 
themselves 
to 
studying 
and 
preparing 
for 
these 
standardized tests, sacrificing 
their already small amount 
of free time in the hopes of 
raising their scores. Huffman 
rooted her actions in a familiar 
sense of desperation to secure 
a better score for her daughter, 
to which prosecutors hit back 
stating that “all parents want 
to help their kids get ahead...yet 
most manage to steer clear of 
conspiracy, bribery and fraud. 
By means of her privilege and 
wealth, Huffman was almost 
able to completely bypass this 
dedication 
and 
hard-earned 
merit. Her actions undoubtedly 
undermine the integrity of the 
college 
preparatory 
system 
as something that genuinely 
prepares students for college.
On May 13, Huffman pleaded 
guilty to conspiracy to commit 
mail fraud and honest services 
mail fraud.” Now, according 
to 
2019 
federal 
guidelines, 
her charges would entail a 

punishment spanning four to 
10 months in prison. Huffman’s 
bribe was marginally smaller 
than 
others 
implicated 
in 
the 
scandal 
including 
Lori 
Loughlin’s 
alleged 
$500,000 
bribe 
to 
the 
University 
of 
Southern California. So, what is 
the punishment? Five months? 
Maybe even the bare minimum 
— let’s say four months? 
14 days.
Felicity 
Huffman 
was 
sentenced to 14 days in prison. 
Fourteen days in prison, one 
year of probation, 250 hours 
of community service and a 
$30,000 fine. The government 
asked for one to 15 months of 
imprisonment, 
but 
Huffman 
was still able to pass by with 
just a slap on the wrist. Sure, 

probation is commonplace for 
those who plead guilty. But, 
for a woman worth nearly 
$20 million, a $30,000 fine 
is nothing. Fourteen days is 
nothing compared to what the 
federal 
guidelines 
suggest. 
Two hundred and fifty hours 
of community service when it 
comes to celebrities has become 
so menial that it’s hard to even 
gauge if it’s a punishment.
At first, the college admissions 
scandal served as a hallmark, 
reminding the American public 
that privilege will continue to 
overrule the hard work of those 
with true dedication and merit. 
However, let us not forget 

the accomplices in this entire 
scandal: the colleges themselves. 
Though all of these colleges 
should be ashamed to even have 
their names mentioned in this 
scandal, these specific shameful 
colleges 
are 
the 
University 
of 
California-Los 
Angeles, 
University 
of 
California-San 
Diego and the University of 
Texas at Austin — all public 
schools. These schools have 
been funded by the government, 
and under that pretense, they 
are supposed to be different 
from the elitist snobbery of 
private schools. 
But, of course, private schools 
are equally guilty in the scandal. 
When the scandal broke, I 
hardly blinked an eye when 
the 
University 
of 
Southern 
California was implicated in 
the bribery scandal, seeing that 
they’re 
already 
comfortable 
taking upwards of $77,000 a 
year from their students. For 
private schools, this scandal 
was 
merely 
a 
confirmation 
that the system was designed 
for the over-privileged and 
underqualified cowards bred 
by America’s richest and most 
famous. Seeing these public 
schools proclaim themselves 
separate from the bureaucratic 
corruption many assumed was 
present within private schools 
is sickening.
With Huffman as the first 
indicted celebrity in the case, 
there is hope that the other high-
profile offenders like Loughlin 
suffer a greater punishment 
than Huffman’s. However, now 
it has also become a mockery of 
the punitive aspect of criminal 
justice and an embarrassing slap 
in the face to those who actually 
believed the wealthy and the 
privileged would be subjected 
to the hard hand of justice.

“Varsity Blues” and the failure in the fallout

How digital “crumbs” can help us understand privacy

JOSHUA KIM | COLUMN

T

he philosopher Timothy 
Morton 
refers 
to 
concepts that are all-
encompassing yet difficult to 
see directly as “hyperobjects.” 
He points to global warming as 
an example of a hyperobject. Its 
enormous scale and amorphous 
nature often cause skepticism 
and despair. Digital privacy can 
be classified as a hyperobject, 
too: We know our data is tracked, 
packaged 
and 
traded 
on 
a 
massive scale, but we don’t often 
see it directly. We get glimpses 
when an oddly specific ad shows 
up on Instagram or Google, but 
stories about huge data brokers 
and detailed databases are tough 
to conceptualize when we have 
such a narrow window into the 
system. Just like climate change, 
this can lead to skepticism and 
despair.
How can we avoid being 
overwhelmed by digital privacy? 
By interacting with the traces 
left behind by systems of big 
data. These digital “crumbs” can 
help make tangible that uneasy 
feeling we get from interacting 
with digital systems. Because the 
technology sector was allowed to 
operate with free reign for so long, 
untangling the breadth and depth 
of the surveillance economy will 
take years. However, confronting 
the evidence currently available 
to us can help clarify the 
realities of the system and 
overcome 
the 
powerlessness 
that can accompany it. Just as 
images of climate change can 
be an effective way to galvanize 
support for action, coming into 
contact with pieces of our digital 
world can help us understand the 
scope and power of the system, 
transforming the intangible into 
the tangible and despair into 
action.
There are some tools that have 
emerged from the recent tech 
backlash that can help us look 
inside the black box of digital 
privacy. The website Have I Been 
Pwned?, created by a Microsoft 
web 
security 
expert, 
allows 
people to see accounts associated 
with their email that have been 
compromised in a data breach. 
Part of the reason the site exists 
is that companies in the United 
States are typically not required 
to notify people when their data 
is breached. When I put my 
personal email address into the 
site, I saw to my surprise that I 
had compromised accounts from 

two separate breaches. Neither 
company had notified me, and 
I was able to link a recent hack 
of my Amazon account to one of 
the breaches, because I (stupidly) 
had reused a password from a 
compromised account. Seeing 
specific instances where my 
data was breached, as well as 
the fraudulent purchases that 
followed, made the implications 
of my data insecurity clearer.
Another tool that can help us 
understand our digital existence 
is an ad personalization tool from 
Google that gives a glimpse of 
the predictions gleaned from 
our personal data. It lets people 
see the interests and preferences 
Google assigns them based off 
of data such as their search 
history, YouTube history and 
partner (third-party) data. I 
found the granularity of Google’s 
predictions about me unnerving. 

I counted 50 different inferences 
that Google made, including my 
estimated age, types of movies 
and music I like and the type of 
transportation I use. I’ve always 
been vaguely aware that my 
activities on the Internet are 
tracked, packaged and traded, 
but seeing how much was tracked 
and how accurate the packaging 
was reified that feeling.
Finally, 
Facebook 
built 
a 
tool that gives users an idea of 
the breadth of organizations 
that have their data. The tool 
lists organizations that have 
run an ad using users’ personal 
information in the past seven 
days. The sheer size of my list was 
surprising, as was who was on 
it. There were some companies 
and organizations I directly 
and often use like Spotify and 
Netflix, but there were also 
many I had never interacted with 
and had no clear connection to. 
For example, my list included a 
lieutenant governor candidate 
from Mississippi, the Kansas 
City Grilled Cheese Festival 

and the Arabic branch of 
Newchic and a Hong Kong-
based retailer. How did these 
organizations I never gave 
my data to and have no clear 
connection with end up with 
my personal information? Why 
do they want it? The answers to 
these questions aren’t clear, but 
they demonstrate the tangled, 
Kafkaesque mess of online 
advertising and data collection. 
I will never go to the Kansas 
City Grilled Cheese Festival 
or shop in the Arabic branch 
of Newchic. Yet, they have my 
personal data and are using it 
(seemingly) mistakenly.
Why does all this collection 
matter? What’s the harm in 
being served a few irrelevant 
ads? First, collecting and storing 
data puts it at risk of being 
breached. Your data is only as 
safe as the weakest organization 
that has it, and we often don’t 
get to choose who collects vast 
profiles on us (see the Equifax 
data breach). Second, it can 
be used to shape our behavior. 
All the data collected on us 
fuels 
behavioral 
predictions 
that can be used with nudges 
to influence our behavior. This 
can lead to a power dynamic 
where organizations with data 
and information can tune and 
herd the rest of us, undermining 
autonomy 
and 
potentially 
democracy. 
Proponents of surveillance 
capitalism often argue that 
people don’t care about privacy 
(see Facebook arguing there is 
no expectation of privacy on its 
platform). Yet, polls consistently 
show otherwise. So, where is 
the disconnect? Because digital 
privacy is a hyperobject, people 
often struggle to articulate their 
discomfort 
and 
frustrations 
with the system. This can make 
people seem apathetic when 
they actually feel helpless. We 
can overcome this by using tools 
like the ones listed above. They 
help us interact with the edges 
of our digital world, giving us 
a better understanding of the 
system and its implications. 
This is empowering — instead 
of feeling overwhelmed and 
aimless, we can demand specific 
changes and start to truly grasp 
our present and future in the 
digital age.

Michigan’s negligence with mental health
I

n September 2019, the 
state 
of 
Michigan’s 
Department of Licensing 
and Regulatory Affairs released 
new 
revisions 
for 
licensed 
professional counselors. These 
revisions dictate that counselors 
will be barred from diagnosing 
and 
using 
psychotherapy 
techniques with their clients. 
The department is hoping to 
have these rules in effect by 
November 2019, approximately 
a month after their Oct. 4 public 
hearing on the proposal.
While LARA claims these 
rules will help protect the 
public, they will actually do the 
opposite. Approximately 10,000 
counseling jobs in Michigan 
will be affected, as diagnosing 
is 
necessary 
for 
insurance 
reimbursement. 
Furthermore, 
the mental health of clients 
will suffer. There are 150,000 
Michigan residents who seek aid 
from professional counselors. 
Under LARA’s new rules, clients 
unable to afford the out-of-
pocket cost will be forced to exit 
treatment, jeopardizing their 
mental health. 
The 
updates 
are 
wildly 
unnecessary. LPCs are the most 
accessible resource in mental 
health care, and their education 
trains them to treat a broad 
range of issues. They are clearly 
qualified to diagnose and use 
psychotherapy techniques. As 
LARA’s rules will not change 
counselors’ 
education 
and 
training, they will continue 
to 
be 
qualified. 
Therefore, 
making revisions is nothing 
more than adding unreasonable 
limitations. If someone goes 
through proper education and 
training, they should be able to 
use their skills, especially when 
it goes toward helping others.
As someone who has received 
therapy for over a year, I can say 
it has been through the help of 
LPCs that I have found success 
in 
my 
recovery. 
Through 
counselors, 
I 
was 
able 
to 
understand my eating disorder 
and grasp my diagnosis of post-
traumatic stress disorder. I 
was able to begin healing and 
learn new coping mechanisms. 
Counselors served as integral 
parts of my treatment team. 
Without them, my road to 
recovery 
would 
be 
more 
strenuous than it already is. 
When I was in a partial 
hospitalization program, the 
majority 
of 
my 
treatment 
team 
was 
counselors. 
The 
head coordinator of the eating 

disorder program was an LPC, 
as was my case manager. Outside 
of them, my team was made 
up of a dietitian, an activity 
therapist and a psychiatrist. 
More 
often 
than 
not, 
my 
counselors were more helpful 
than my psychiatrist. While my 
psychiatrist was able to confirm 
my 
diagnoses, 
prescribe 
medicine 
and 
occasionally 
offer 
advice, 
it 
was 
my 
counselors who unquestionably 
contributed to my recovery. I 
was able to express my emotions 
without judgment or pity, and 
they provided support during 
any difficult situations. In the 
hospital, 
these 
impromptu 
sessions 
were 
often 
during 
mealtimes. Depending on who 
was with me, my team would 
help me process my thoughts and 
would help make the situation 
seem less scary. In outpatient 
treatment, my counselor back 
home provided similar support 
in and outside of sessions. But 
she added another layer of 
support outside of sessions by 
texting me to check in and by 
allowing me to text her during 
panic attacks, if needed. Today, 
my counselor in Ann Arbor 
still serves as a vital part of my 
recovery. If LARA’s revisions 
are approved, I will no longer 
be able to attend counseling, 
and I will lose a needed service.
Thousands more like me will 
suffer from the regulations. 
Mental 
health 
care 
will 
continue 
to 
deteriorate 
if 
counselors are barred from 
providing 
diagnoses 
and 
utilizing 
psychotherapy. 
Michigan already has a mental 
health crisis. The need for care 
continually increases, but there 
are 
not 
enough 
counselors 
to aid people suffering from 
mental illness. By limiting the 
help even more, Michigan will 
further the mental health crisis. 
As a result, mental health 
insurance 
will 
be 
rendered 
useless, 
as 
counselors 
will 
no longer be qualified for 
reimbursement and will have 
to charge clients full price. 
Consequently, only the rich 
can then afford counseling. 
If counselors are not able to 
diagnose or use psychotherapy 
anyway, the sessions would 
not be worth the money, and 
help will be sought only from 
psychologists. 
However, 
there are not nearly as many 
psychologists, and their higher 
education makes them more 
expensive. Poorer clients cannot 

afford such a high financial 
change. 
Thus, 
LARA’s 
revisions will create a broken 
system, 
where 
qualified 
counselors 
are 
unable 
to 
treat, and the mental health of 
poorer patients will suffer. 
But it’s not a hopeless 
situation. 
Though 
LARA’s 
public hearing is already on 
Oct. 4, a Michigan House bill 
currently in committee can 
neutralize the changes. House 
Bill 
4325 
was 
introduced 
by state Rep. Aaron Miller, 
R-Sturgis, and its purpose is 
to clarify the state’s wording 
and requirements for LPCs. 
Unlike LARA’s revisions, HB 
4325 will expand educational 
requirements while allowing 
counselors 
to 
continue 
to 
diagnose and treat. This bill is 
what would actually benefit the 
Michigan population, as it does 
not place practicing limitations 
on 
counselors. 
Expanding 
education does require more 
training to become a counselor, 
but it does not limit their 
treatment 
approach 
and 
diagnosing ability. No jobs will 
be lost and no clients will bear 
the consequences. 
If HB 4325 is passed before 
LARA’s revisions are accepted, 
then it will stop the revisions 
from happening. And yet, if the 
revisions are accepted, the bill 
will then be inapplicable. It is a 
fateful race against time, but it’s 
not entirely out of the public’s 
control. Residents must voice 
their support for counselors 
and inclusive mental health 
care.
Michigan has a responsibility 
to represent and care for its 
residents, but the regulations 
are negligent and endangering. 
Therefore, 
we 
must 
fight 
back. Signing petitions and 
participating in letter-writing 
campaigns are good starting 
points. Taking the time out of 
your day to support counselors 
and mental health in Michigan 
is worth it and will benefit 
our 
society. 
Mental 
health 
is a personal issue affecting 
our communities, but mental 
health care will flounder if we 
silently 
allow 
unreasonable 
and unnecessary requirements 
for 
counselors. 
Access 
to 
mental health care is a human 
right, and we cannot allow our 
government to threaten the 
health of its residents.

How can we 
avoid being 
overwhelmed by 
digital privacy?

the accomplices in

When I was around 10 or 11, I begged my 
mom over and over again for a copy of Tiger 
Beat magazine. You know the type — they’re 
hard to miss, with a neon cover, an obtrusive 
face of a teenage heartthrob and headlines 
like “Take a quiz to find out what color your 
birthday cake will be” plastered across their 
glossy surfaces. Tiger Beat and other teen 
magazines like it were more than just sugar-
drenched literary beginnings for preteen 
girls and boys. For me the full-size poster 
of Zac Efron that hung on the back of my 
door was a constant companion, keeping me 
company from the moment I pulled him out of 
a magazine until a friend who slept over said it 
was creepy. May he rest in peace. 
There’s nothing wrong with a shrine to your 
celebrity crush, especially in that hormonal 
hell we affectionately call tweenagehood. 
But in the modern age, the flashy quizzes and 
posters and kissing tips that don’t actually 
work are no longer relegated to the pages of 
magazines like Tiger Beat and Seventeen — 
instead, they’re very, very online. Somehow, 
in the last 10 years the tabloid media and its 
tried-and-true tropes of sensationalism have 
merged with teen media to create something 
of an amorphous monster, constantly hungry 
for bits of personal information left by careful 
(or not-so-careful) celebrities. It’s invasive, but 
not in the cute way it used to be. We all had our 
Zac Efrons at age 13, but should we really still 
care about the girlfriend of a famous young 
man? His favorite food? Colors he likes girls 
to wear?
I woke up one day during the summer, rolled 
over and found on my Twitter feed the same 
Seventeen Magazine article posted seven 
times in a row. The headline read “Everything 
You Need to Know About Tom Holland’s 
Girlfriend Olivia Bolton.” Tom Holland of 
“Spider-Man” fame apparently had a new 
girlfriend. But the comments left alongside the 
article expressed outrage. “Do we really need 

to know this much about a normal woman?” 
one asked. “Leave her alone,” another echoed. 
I hesitated, then clicked on the link, which 
took me to a pretty standard list of web-
sleuthed information about poor Olivia. I 
can’t even imagine the lengths to which the 
reporter searched for some of the facts noted, 
which dive deeply into her education, age and 
everywhere she had been seen with Holland 
in the past few months. “Tomdaya stans 
everywhere thoroughly freaked out, horrified 
at the fact that Tom and Zendaya may not 
actually be an item,” the author wrote. I rolled 
my eyes. 
Seventeen Magazine isn’t just for 17-year-
olds anymore. Really, nothing is. The loss of 
those neon covers and the glossy pages in our 
hands has made it easier to fall into a clickbait 
trap. No tween is going to beg her mother for a 
copy of Tiger Beat because all she has to do is 
look up her questions, her quizzes, her deepest 
darkest loves on Google. The tween mentality 
is no longer just for tweens; it’s for everyone 
and their mothers, literally. And for people like 
Olivia Bolton, that is a big problem. We don’t 
need to know everything about her. No self-
respecting adult person does. The teen media 
industry used to sugarcoat it, to wonder where 
her clothes were from and where to get them. 
Now, people on the internet send her nasty 
messages trying to find out more, mixing the 
worlds of fiction, media and reality beyond 
recognition. Our hunger for information isn’t 
surface-level, isn’t cute, isn’t a phase anymore. 
That’s what it used to be, a phase. But as the 
Tom Hollands and Olivia Boltons of the world 
continue to proliferate in celebrity gossip, it’s 
clearer and clearer to see how this aspect of 
our culture has changed. The introduction 
of the internet into the equation has spun 
it out of control, allowing everyone to go 
deeper than the pages of a poppy magazine. 
There are no limits or ethics. There is only 
opportunity to go deeper, and sometimes too 
deep. No, we don’t need to know everything 
about Tom Holland’s new girlfriend. As adults, 
with our own interests and relationships and 
responsibilities, do we really need to know the 
personal lives of celebrities at all?

How long must Travis Miller wait for the recognition he 
deserves? Will he ever receive it?
Travis Miller has made music under numerous stage 
names, but his most impactful work has come under the 
pseudonym Lil Ugly Mane. Despite his lack of recognition 
outside of the underground scene (as well as certain 
corners of the internet), Lil Ugly Mane is responsible for 
the best Memphis rap by anyone not named Three 6 Mafia. 
His most well-known work, Mista Thug Isolation, is a 
hazy homage to early Memphis rap, but it’s far from a rote 
reproduction: Miller imbues the album with a dreamlike 
and colorful flavor that marks the project as distinctly his 
own.
His final album under the Lil Ugly Mane moniker, 
Oblivion Access, is a bolder and experimental, if less 
accessible, project. Not as directly influenced by the 
Memphis style, Oblivion Access is much more frustrated 
and toxic. At times he can get a little preachy, especially 
on “Columns,” but overall he pulls off his progression to a 
more industrial, noisy sound quite well. 
However, his best work is not to be found on this, or any, 
album, but instead on two of his singles: “On Doing An Evil 
Deed Blues” and “Uneven Compromise.”
The former is a plunderphonic collage of old-school East 
Coast hip hop, which segues into a beautiful cloud-rap 
reflection on the creative process and Travis’s relationship 
to his own output. The beat itself, produced by Travis, is 
gorgeous and kaleidoscopic. 
During the bridge, Travis states plainly one of the main 
points he makes in “On Doing An Evil Deed Blues”: “The 
blues weren’t born in a bunker.” This line has two points 
of significance: the first is that the emotional resonance 
behind blues music (and, 
by implication, all music) is 
inseparable from the artist’s 
actual life — no one can 
write the blues if they’ve 
never had them. The second 
and 
more 
interesting 
point is that creativity is a 
dialectic process; that is, all 
creative works are borne 
out of an artist’s reaction to 
and engagement with the 

artistic expression and ideas that they have encountered 
before. The intro is an overt expression of this idea, a sonic 
collage assembled out of fragments of older works that 
creates a coherent and new statement. “Art is imitation, 
creation is forever,” he claims. 
The other thematic aspect of the track is Travis’s 
relationship to rap, and how it has changed over time. “I 
used to like to rhyme when it was all about linguistics / 
When Big L verses was like decoding hieroglyphics,” he 
says; rap, for Travis, was always about his love for music, 
and, as he reveals elsewhere in the song, while he once 
dreamed of fame, he realizes that that was never his true 
goal. These two themes are connected. In recalling his 
early influences, Lil Ugly Mane comes to the broader 
conclusion that no artist escapes the shadow of those who 
initially turned on their passion. 
Lil Ugly Mane’s other magnum opus is the 2014 
track “Uneven Compromise.” The first few minutes are 
dissonant, a near-satanic depiction of violence and misery. 
Just when the darkness feels like it’s about to overwhelm 
you, when the sickness is creeping in at the borders of 
the listener’s mind, the floor falls out into a short-lived, 
oddly-pastoral interlude. About five minutes in, the track 
launches into one of the best examples of boom-bap 
storytelling ever put on wax, a story of an old friend who 
is hopelessly and permanently lost to drug addiction and 
mental deterioration.
“Your homeboys change sometimes / The thoughts 
rearrange in their brains sometimes / It’s too hard dealing 
with the pain sometimes / But you gotta let go, you can’t 
save their lives.” Lil Ugly Mane’s nihilism here is convincing 
and painful. There is an overabundance of dark hip hop, 
but there are very few songs that manage to make darkness 
feel like such a powerful and all-encompassing force (as 
opposed to a cheap trick designed to provoke, or lend the 
artist a sense of gravitas).
Lil Ugly Mane’s ability to challenge the listener while 
integrating such disparate 
influences into a raw yet 
cohesive work is that of a 
creative master. His lack 
of mainstream recognition 
accentuates the themes of 
his music — he is a forgotten 
legend who never was, 
living in the dark and damp 
trenches of hip hop. He 
wouldn’t want it any other 
way.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

As I read “The Testaments,” Margaret 
Atwood’s latest Booker Prize-nominated novel, I 
was reminded of a case study of Darwin’s finches I 
learned about in an anthropology class I took last 
year. Throughout the 1970s, biologists Peter and 
Rosemary Grant observed the finch population 
of the Galápogos Islands. As a result of a severe 
drought that radically changed the food supply 
available to the finches, natural selection worked 
to alter the makeup of the population in response 
to the demands of this new environment, resulting 
in the production of a completely different species 
of bird. The Grants disproved Darwin’s belief 
that evolution needed hundreds or thousands of 
years to significantly change a population — in 
some cases, it only needs a few years to create 
astounding change. 
When it comes to Atwood’s “The Testaments,” 
it’s arguable that things line up with the Grants’s 
story quite well — only the novel’s characters are 
the finches, and Gilead is the drought. In “The 
Testaments,” we learn that Gilead, the apocalyptic 
and theocratic dystopia of Atwood’s modern 
classic “The Handmaid’s Tale,” has continued 
its reign of terror well after the events of the 
latter novel. However, while “The Handmaid’s 
Tale” chronicled the very first years of Gilead, 
readers of “The Testaments” get to witness what 
has become of this regime — how it has evolved 
in its cruelty and, more poignantly, how the 
women who have grown up inside it hardly even 
resemble the women who lived before them just 
decades ago. The young girls who have grown 
up inside Gilead might as well be a different 
species — feminism is a foreign concept to them, 
heinous crimes like murder and sexual assault are 
everyday occurrences and they don’t even know 
how to read.
Just as Darwin’s finches were products of a 
drought that reshaped their environment, the 

women of “The Testaments” are products of 
Gilead and its culture of hate and shame and 
oppression. The prospect of centuries upon 
centuries of human advancement crumbling 
within just a few decades is genuinely terrifying 
and truly fascinating to read about, and Atwood’s 
talent for visualizing this creatively is without a 
doubt the novel’s greatest asset. 
The haunting and frightening world of Gilead 
introduced in “The Handmaid’s Tale” has made 
its mark on our culture, spawning its own Emmy-
winning Hulu adaptation. There are many 
reasons why “The Handmaid’s Tale” has had the 
cultural impact it’s had — the parallels Atwood 
draws between her fictional Gilead and our own 
society’s internalized patriarchy are biting, deeply 
disturbing and impossible to forget. Aside from 
any political and social resonance the book might 
have, though, “The Handmaid’s Tale” is simply a 
great work of literature, a beautifully written and 
fully realized account of one woman’s journey as 
she’s forced to go through a living hell. 
Given all of this, it’s clear that “The Testaments” 
has a lot to live up to. You could say that the book 
should be read as its own entity, independent 
from its predecessor, but I don’t think this is 
what Atwood wants from her readers at all — she 
refers back to “The Handmaid’s Tale” constantly. 
And although “The Testaments” is written from 
the perspective of a different narrator (three 
narrators, in fact), all three of the women it gives 
voice to are intricately and permanently bonded 
to Offred, and this bond is a central catalyst for 
the decisions they end up making. 
So, I’m going to compare “The Testaments” 
to “The Handmaid’s Tale.” I think I have to. 
And, as I contemplate their differences, I’m 
more and more aware of the inferiority of “The 
Testaments” in nearly every respect. For one, its 
prose, in relation to “The Handmaid’s Tale” at 
least, is unrefined and often unconvincing. One 
narrator in particular utters lines so unnatural, so 
cringeworthy I could hardly stomach them (“I am 
fucking sorry, but we are in a hot mess emergency 
here!”). At certain points it reads like a young 
adult novel, which certainly isn’t detrimental in 
and of itself but feels completely out of place in the 
context of its predecessor.
Simply put, this kind of writing belongs 
nowhere near a Booker Prize, and it certainly 
wouldn’t be in the running for the award if it 
weren’t the brainchild of Margaret Atwood. A 
more glaring and upsetting criticism, though, 
and what may just be the book’s fatal flaw, is the 
superficial and stereotypical characterization of 
its narrators Atwood opts for. All three narrators 
are two-dimensional, archetypal embodiments 
of the cultures they come from, and there simply 
aren’t enough pages in this plot-heavy novel to 
flesh them out further. These women deserve 
more. They each deserve a novel of their own.
I don’t want to sound like I despise this book. 
I don’t in the slightest. “The Testaments” is an 
addictive read with an uplifting (albeit slightly 
unearned) resolution. I admire its ambition, its 
aspiration to give voice to as many women as 
possible. Most importantly, it doesn’t make me 
love “The Handmaid’s Tale” any less. Ultimately, 
though, if I do decide to return to Gilead, it won’t 
be by way of “The Testaments.”

I was as prepared as I could be going into the series 
premiere of Chuck Lorre’s new series “Bob Hearts 
Abishola” to cringe as much as humanly possible. 
After all, the premise begs it. Middle-aged white man 
courts Nigerian immigrant nurse? Nope, nothing 
good can come of this. Yet I was pleasantly surprised 
at the end to discover 
that while the show isn’t 
particularly 
funny, 
it 
handles its subjects with a 
surprising amount of grace 
and nuance.
Bob (Billy Gardell, “Mike 
and Molly”) is a successful 
Detroit-based 
workaholic 
sock 
salesman 
who 
is 
introduced in the midst of 
having a heart attack. In 
his overnight stay at the 
hospital, he is taken care 
of a Nigerian nurse named 
Abishola (Folake Olowofoyeku, “Transparent”) to 
whom he takes an immediate liking. When she sings 
him a Yoruba lullaby while he tries to relieve himself, 
he’s a goner.
There was a lot of potential here to make the fact that 
Abishola is Nigerian the butt of the joke. Likely due to 
the influence of one of the show’s creators, British-
Nigerian comedian Gina Yashere, the day-to-day 
aspects of the Nigerian immigrant experience are at 
the forefront and are the most interesting parts of the 
show. Abishola lives with her young son and relatives 
Olu (Shola Adewusi, “Family Affairs”) and Tunde 
(Barry Shabaka Henley, “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”) 
in a cramped apartment and lives a life worlds 
away from Bob. Yashere herself shows up as Kemi, 
another Nigerian woman who is good friends with 

Abishola, and notably, their conversations are entirely 
in subtitled Yoruba.
The conversations between the various Nigerian 
characters are also illuminating about the West 
African and also broader immigrant experience. 
Examples include a contentious conversation between 
Abishola and her son in which she discourages him 
from joining the track team in order to further 
encourage him to study to become a doctor. While 
cliché to an extent, these sentiments are familiar 
to many other immigrant children. In addition to 
these 
more 
substantive 
discussions, 
the 
small 
discussions 
about 
food 
and other cultural tidbits 
are equally important and 
informative.
Even more thankfully, 
Bob’s interest in Abishola 
is sweet (if a bit sad) and 
respectful and doesn’t ever 
veer into creepy, fetishizing 
stalker 
territory. 
While 
Abishola 
isn’t 
quite 
as 
interested (and much more 
focused 
on 
establishing 
herself in the country), she is certainly slightly 
charmed by the incredibly Midwestern Bob.
All things being said, the unfortunate part of the 
show is that it’s just not particularly funny. The 
first five minutes themselves include some yawn-
inducing fat and fart jokes, and it doesn’t get much 
better at all. The few bright spots are the interactions 
between Abishola and her relatives, with the latter’s 
melodrama contrasting with the steelier pragmatism 
of the former.
“Bob Hearts Abishola” is ultimately a mildly 
funny yet quite sweet story of a courtship between 
two different, equally lonely people. It treats its 
immigrant subjects with much more nuance than 
I imagined, and that in and of itself might make it 
worth a watch.

‘Bob Hearts Abishola’ is well
intentioned but lacks laughs

This article contains spoilers from the series “Breaking 
Bad.”
The first acquaintance Walter White ever killed almost 
escaped with his life, twice. Walt (Bryan Cranston, 
“Sneaky Pete”) strangled New Mexico-based, Latino 
methamphetamine distributor Krazy-8 (Max Arciniega, 
“Bosch”) three episodes into the five-season run of 
“Breaking Bad.” Over the next several seasons, Walt 
gets much more practice eliminating his opposition in 
the drug trade and his murder methods becoming more 
laissez-faire, but at the time Krazy-8 posed a legitimate 
challenge to the nascent drug lord. His second, nearly 
successful attempt to convince his captor that he deserved 
to live was lengthy, involved. Life stories were exchanged 
and morals were appealed to over the piss-bucket and 
the meals Walt would bring to his prisoner, who was 
bike-locked by the neck to a pole in Walt’s partner Jesse 
Pinkman’s (Aaron Paul, “BoJack Horseman”) basement. 

Krazy-8’s first escape attempt was much simpler, though, 
as he merely limped down the road outside the suburban 
house, illegitimately claimed by Jesse from his late aunt, 
on foot. It is that scene — Walt driving down the road and 
depositing Krazy-8’s body into the trunk of his Pontiac 
Aztek — that haunts me.
How is that? In a show that includes shots of a man’s 
face, half-intact, half-skeletal, after a bomb detonates, a 
show with sequences inside a neo-Nazi torture chamber, 
how did Krazy-8 getting caught and dumped in the 
protagonist’s trunk get its staying power in my brain? 
While the shock and vulgarity of the latter scene is much 
less obvious, it is more affecting for its insidiousness, its 
absurdity. Because one man plucked the other man he 
hadn’t finished killing yet right off the street. A suburban 
neighborhood in Albuquerque, by no means unpopulous, 
had nothing to say in response. He got away with it 
without the added stress of hiding it.
More than 11 years have passed since that episode 
aired, just under six since the series finale, and now the 
makers of “Breaking Bad” have another episode in store. 
The film sequel, “El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,” is set 
for limited theatrical and digital release on Netflix Oct. 11, 
a week from today. The only concern expectant fans seem 
to have for “El Camino” is whether or not it will live up 
to the original incarnation’s dramatic caliber, reminiscent 
of the fanatic intellectual gridlock that blesses revered 
stories’ adaptations into other mediums. Aren’t there 
better questions we might hazard to pose?

I’m afraid we’re too enamored with Walt’s story and 
the show’s glory to question it at all, including when we 
look to what this film will have to offer. The untouchability 
of the show and the untouchability of Walter White are so 
entangled that the inner workings of the show, at times 
problematic and overly romantic, are hidden. My aim is 
to begin to untwine them, to bring them to light, so that 
we might assess whether “El Camino” is being used as 
an opportunity to revel in these fantasies further, or to 
outgrow them.
The Suburbs: How to hide in plain sight
“I’m supporting my community. I hide in plain sight, 
same as you,” says Gustavo “Gus” Fring (Giancarlo 
Esposito, “The Get Down”) to Walt in a crowded hospital 
wing, in an episode of Season 3 titled “I See You.” Both 
men are waiting to hear about the condition of Walt’s 
brother-in-law, Hank Schaffer (Dean Norris, “Scandal”), 
a DEA agent who has just barely survived a violent 
altercation with two men from the Mexican drug cartel, 
twins Leonel (Daniel Moncada, “Justified”) and Marco 
Salamanca (Luis Moncada, “Queen of the South”). To no 
one else’s knowledge, however, Gus is also there to assess 
the condition of the other survivor, Leonel, who was not 
supposed to come out of it alive. Gus knows that because 
he orchestrated the whole thing.
But let’s back up. Because, while it is true that 
Gus was the man behind the attack, both Walt and 
Gus share responsibility for the violence that almost 
claimed three lives. Several episodes prior, Leonel 
and Marco’s cousin Tuco Salamanca (Raymond Cruz, 
“Major Crimes”) was Walt and Jesse’s distributor. 
Later kidnapped by the violent, volatile, drug-addicted 
Tuco, Walt and Jesse try (unsuccessfully) to poison 
him to save their own lives. In the end, though, they 
don’t have to. Hank, who was tracking Jesse’s car 
as part of an investigation of Walt’s disappearance, 
ends up on the right side of a shootout with Tuco. 
To avenge his death, the Salamanca family at first 
turns their attention to Walt. But Gus, dependent on 
Walt for his product of unrivaled purity, first warns 
the Salamancas to wait until his business with Walt 
has concluded, then redirects their attention toward 
Hank, the man who actually pulled the trigger. 
All that and yet there the two of them stand, 
conversing in a sea of cops. Wearing clean button-
downs, untouched by the carnage of the battles they 
mechanized. Hiding in plain sight. How do they do it? 
Where does their camouflage come from?
It has something to do with their button-downs. 
Something to do with the houses they drove from 
to get there, the homes they will return to when they 
leave, that won’t have cops parked in their driveways 
when they get back. Not everyone can hide in plain 
sight, can they? Could a Mexican-American man have 
inhabited that same space in the hospital free of attention, 
suspicion? Could Jesse — in his baggy, ever-oversized 
sweatshirts and jeans, with his designation as resident 
methhead? Hiding in plain sight requires a particular set 
of conditions.The camouflaged must satisfy a number of 
invisible checkboxes before their surroundings cooperate, 
before they fade into the landscape. One of the foremost 
checkboxes Gus and Walt fill (but Walt most readily) is 
that of suburban existence, and the status that comes 
with it. The suburbs have a hand in protecting these two 
participants in the drug trade.
Let me be clear: I’m not talking about merely physical 
plots of land on the outskirts of a city, or implying that a 
picket fence will fend off the DEA. I’m talking about the 
ideology and social constructions that are as foundational 
to suburbia as the cement and steel upon which the 
suburban homes rest. I’m talking about the suburbs as 
a narrative about its inhabitants, which subsumes their 
individual narratives and tells an incorrigible story of 
good citizenship and clean records. I’m talking about the 
people who are rarely cast for the narrative — particularly 
people of color and unmarried folks. I’m talking about a 
myth, but a powerful, historical, lasting one, with wordly 
implications.
Historian Elaine Tyler May has written at length 
about the distinct effects of postwar 
suburbanization on the American 
family. In “Containment at Home,” 
the first chapter of her book 
“Homeward Bound,” May evaluates 
the role the suburbs were supposed to 
play during the Cold War. They were 
envisioned as a “bulwark” against the 
most prominent political concern of 
the day — that is, communism and 
class relations. (It is not difficult to see 
how this stolid bulwark might remain 
in place even as the political climate 
changes, deflecting our evolving 
concerns.) The latter portion of the 
chapter May devotes to analyzing 
survey data from suburban-American 
husbands and wives from the Cold 
War 
Era. 
Unsurprisingly, 
these 
firsthand accounts of the costs and 
benefits of suburban life suggest that 
suburbanites maintained a good deal 
of faith, however unrealistic, in the 
pacifying effect of the suburbs. One 
man in particular, Joseph, husband 
of fellow interviewee Emily, was 
recorded going on a jaded rant in 
which he remarks, “Love of neighbor 
… get him before he gets you.” May 
follows with an interpretation of how 
Joseph’s outlook on the world affects 
what he expects from the suburbs in 
turn: “Joseph’s cynicism toward the 
wider world made him place even 
higher hopes on the family to be a 
buffer.”
I think May’s term buffer might 
be a more precise representation of 
what suburban status offers. What 
buffer accounts for that camouflage 
doesn’t is that the protection goes 
in two directions. The protective 
sphere of the suburbs absorbs the 
shock of social ills, but also deflects 
accusations of complicity in those 
ills. The suburbs are presumed “safe” 
from the outside world, so it follows 
that the outside world has nothing to 

fear from them. This cycle of mutual protection is only 
sustainable, however, when it’s left untouched, unspoken 
of. Don’t let in anyone new, anyone who doesn’t look the 
same, and no flags will be raised.
Jesse Pinkman may have grown up in the suburbs, 
but he loses that source of protection four episodes into 
the series. His parents have no tolerance for his drug 
addiction and selling and will not let him inhabit their 
sanctum. The irony is that their younger, high-achieving 

son Jake (Benjamin Petry) uses drugs as well — he just 
hides it better. In Season One, Jesse asks to stay with his 
parents for a couple of days, but when their housekeeper 
finds a marijuana cigarette in his bedroom, they kick him 
out. Before he leaves their house for the last time, Jake 
runs outside and thanks his big brother for covering for 
him — the cigarette that lost Jesse his suburban family life 
was actually Jake’s.
Walt’s role in his suburban household is more 
gridlocked. He’s the provider, the father of two children. 
Even when his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn, “Shades of 
Blue”) figures out where Walt’s additional money comes 
from, she does not turn him in. She tries multiple times to 
divorce him, but he almost always finds a way back into 
their home, to the point where it seems inevitable, or at 
least by social design. Walt does not go on the run until 
the third-to-last episode of the series, after his wife and 
son find out that Walt’s actions led to his own brother-in-
law’s death.
Whereas Jesse loses the protection of suburban 
existence almost instantly, Walt never quite does until the 
very end. And it shows.
Selective silences in “Breaking Bad” (after 
Langston Hughes)
Héctor Salamanca (Mark Margolis, “The Affair”) 
doesn’t speak. He appears to have suffered a debilitating 
stroke sometime before Walt entered the drug trade; he 
lives in a nursing home and uses a wheelchair. Instead of 
speaking, he communicates primarily through the use of 
a bell: a ding means yes, silence means no. The only time 
we hear his voice is in flashbacks, in which he speaks his 
native Spanish. 
When characters confront him about his past as a 
member of the cartel in Mexico, or to inform him of 
the repercussions from his fraught past that his family 
members now have to bear — I’m thinking of a scene 
when Gus shares that he just murdered the last of Don 
Salamanca’s descendents, terminating the Salamanca line 
for good — all the elderly man can do in response is breathe 
more vigorously, curl up his lip and dart his eyes around 
the room in a wild fury, not unspeakable, but unspoken. 
Echo:
Why are
Only white drug dealers
Allowed to speak?
Don Salamanca’s twin nephews Leonel and Marco 
do not speak, either. That is never explained. They 
communicate through nods, glances and choreographed 
acts of violence. We hear their voices in one flashback, 
speaking Spanish, and perhaps one other scene. Aside 
from that, we never hear why they do the horrific things 
they do.
Echo:
Will we ever
Listen
To Latinx voices?
The perimeter of Walt’s drug empire is always quiet, 
untouched until he and his associates arrive. It made 
for some beautiful, disarming cinematography: open 
desert, terracotta-tinged landscape, the lone vehicle 
coughing out its cloud of dust as it makes its way across 
the screen, uncontested. It is with shame that I admit it 
did not hit me that these supposedly empty lands are 
actually reservations until Walt says the title of Season 
5, episode 13 — “To’hajiilee” — aloud and adds that it’s 
the name of a Native American settlement. The random 
Native American character, usually performing a Good 
Samaritan function, showed up here and there, but not 
enough to make their existence felt or relevant, to the 
purposes of the show.
Echo: 
How many people
Did “Breaking Bad”
Silence?
In “Breaking Bad,” identity and place of origin quietly 
dictate not only what you are able to get away with, but 
also how much of a story you get to have. This reality has 

large, obvious, somatic manifestations in the physical 
violence different bodies are susceptible to, even though 
many of them operate within the same economy; I 
could compare Walt’s wound log to those of many other 
characters, and the results would be similar, if not more 
dramatic. But there are also subtler manifestations of 
this insidious determinism, equally worth noting, in the 
violence others’ stories and ethnic identities sustain.
Revoking the power of a disenfranchised people 

to tell their own story is an injustice. To continue 
this disenfranchisement in today’s political climate, 
however, would move from unsettling to outrageous, to 
corroboration in today’s more concerted destruction of 
immigrant and indigenous peoples. “El Camino” would 
do well to begin the work of refusing these silencings. 
To start, perhaps it should remember its very title comes 
from the language of the characters it tried to silence for 
five seasons.
The other Heisenberg effect
“I think the reason why viewers, myself included, 
continue to root for Walt, even in this tough final season, 
is that he continues to serve as a fantasy figure,” said 
Dr. David Pierson, a professor of media studies at the 
University of Southern Maine, in an interview published 
by Pacific Standard two days before the “Breaking Bad” 
series finale “Felina” aired in 2013. “By living a double-
life and identity as Heisenberg, he is able to take charge 
of his life, to become more assertive and to become a self-
sufficient entrepreneur. For the first time in his life, he is 
able to effectively use his talents as a chemist to build an 
empire. He also does it for the right reasons, to secure his 
family’s future for a couple of generations.” 
Contrast Pierson’s latter assessment with one of 
the final confessions Walt makes to his wife Skylar in 
“Felina.” He begins, “All the things that I did, you need 
to understand — ” She cuts him off: “If I have to hear, 
one more time, that you did this for the family … ” He 
interjects. “I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And 
I was really … ” After a long pause: “I was really alive.”
So yes, there were times, thankfully, when the show 
wrested awake from the fantasy Pierson describes, 
moments of consciousness, of reflexivity. A lot of these 
moments were clustered in the final two seasons of the 
show — which are also arguably the best two. I believe 
it happened every time something forced Walt to lose 
his illusion of control, of invincibility; these moments 
seem to coincide with times when the writers also 
remembered Walt’s situation was a cautionary tale, 
rather than a fantasy for viewers to crave.
There were of course, other times, when Walt’s 
invincibility high was so potent, we got a secondhand 
high. The finale of Season Four embodies this, when 
Walt finally outsmarts Gus, leveraging Jesse’s loyalty 
and Don Salamanca’s revenge wish in the process, and 
kills his biggest rival to date — he then declares over the 
phone to a suspicious Skyler, “I won.” These were the 
moments that engendered Walt’s aspirational quality, 
as well as irrational hatred for characters who disrupted 
his fantasy. We might call the sum of these moments 
the other Heisenberg effect: Writing that made Walt’s 
invincibility seem the result of his intellect alone 
changes the nature of his reception by audiences.
At any point, “Breaking Bad” was in flux between 
reveling in Walt’s fantastical double-life and exposing 
 
the dramatic moral compromising and social positioning 
that granted Walt the ability to lead those two lives in 
turns. While the show may be a combination of both, 
what is the net effect? I’m not positive the moments of 
reflexivity sufficed to force its audience into the same 
consciousness, the same awakeness. Fantasies have an 
inertia that is difficult to overcome. It seems to be the 
inertia that rests on the minds of the sizable proportion 
of audience members who expressed severe hatred 
for Skyler White — likely on the basis of her continual 
resistance against Walt’s manipulation. Among these 
fans are Facebook users who created a “I Hate Skyler 
White” page on the site, and a man who expressed a 
desire to kill Anna Gunn — the actress who plays Skyler 
— online, as Gunn herself noted in an op-ed for The New 
York Times. I think it’s safe to say that it will take more 
than two seasons and a handful of lucid moments to 
undo these kinds of illusions.

Two weeks after a season-altering loss at Wisconsin, Michigan gets 
tested again. This time, it comes at home. No. 14 Iowa comes into Ann 
Arbor unbeaten — and impressively so. The Wolverines will confront 
a litany of questions saturday afternoon. Has the offense truly taken 
strides, or was the Rutgers showing a facade? Can the defense stack 
up against a formidable offense? The result of Saturday’s bout will 
reveal plenty about the makeup of this team, now and going forward.

Michigan cannot exorcise all its demons on 
Saturday. But it can take an important step.

Middle Tennessee State (Aug. 31): Look man, 
the middle of Tennessee is decidedly not a state.

Army (Sept. 7): The Army football team: The 
only time running behind enemy lines is a good 
idea.

Penn State (Oct. 19): Hey, Mike.

Notre Dame (Oct. 26): You think beating Mich-
igan is special? Everyone’s doing it these days!

Maryland (Nov. 2): You’ve got 59 problems 
and a team is one.

Wisconsin (Sept. 21): Sure, your town is sick 
and your beer is elite and your football team is 
dominant, but do you have a sculpture that says 
“Art” from every angle?

Michigan State (Nov. 16): The Michigan Daily 
has beaten The State News 14 years in a row.
Rutgers (Sept. 28): My grandma’s New Jersey 
retirement home mahjong group could beat Rut-
gers in football ... basketball would be close, too.

Iowa (Oct. 5): The year is 2080. Aliens have 
taken over. Iowa capped off a 7-5 season with a 
five-year extension for Kirk Ferentz. All is well.

Illinois (Oct. 12): Someone go over there and 
make sure Lovie Smith still has a pulse.

Ohio State (Nov. 30): Do you think Justin

Indiana (Nov. 23): Hoosier favorite to be the 
next head coach of this supremely mediocre

What to watch for: Iowa

The only real consensus among 
pundits and fans about Saturday’s 
game against No. 14 Iowa is that it 
will be very, very revealing.
In 
all 
likelihood, 
No. 
19 
Michigan’s true capability as a team 
is somewhere between the one 
that got run out of Camp Randall 
Stadium on Sept. 21 and the one 
that shut out Rutgers last Saturday 
at the Big House. But where on 
that spectrum it is will determine 
the direction of its season. Can the 
Wolverines achieve the goals they’ve 
spent the last two weeks saying are 
still attainable? Or is this a team 
ticketed for 7-5?
Michigan 
under 
Harbaugh 
has historically been very good in 
these types of games. Excluding 
Ohio State, a demon all its own, the 
Wolverines are 5-1 against ranked 
teams at home since 2015, and the 
one loss came on a fluke last-second 
play against Michigan State in 2015. 
But at the same time, Iowa runs a 
very similar scheme to Wisconsin, 
just without the Heisman candidate 
running back, and we all saw how it 
went against the Badgers.
Here are some things to keep a 
look out for as Michigan tries to get 
its season back on track:
Can Michigan score first?
The stat you’ve probably heard by 
now is that in the first three games 
of the Wolverines’ season, they 
fumbled the ball away on the first 
drive. But more concerning is that in 
each of those games, the Wolverines 
subsequently allowed the opponent 
to march down the field and score a 
touchdown.
Senior tight end Nick Eubanks 
said after the Wisconsin game that 
it was a mental issue, that allowing 
those early touchdowns deflated the 
team. In that light, the importance of 
the Wolverines scoring first cannot 
be overstated.
If Michigan can find the end 
zone early, it could give them a 
boost of confidence that may well 
translate to the rest of the game. 
But if the defense falters early, brace 
yourselves.
How does Shea Patterson look?
Through 
the 
season’s 
early 
goings, the senior quarterback was 
some combination of injured and 
bad, but he bounced back in a major 
way against the Scarlet Knights, 
completing 17 of 23 passes for 276 
yards and a touchdown. Perhaps 

more significantly, Patterson ran for 
three more scores — and that was in 
just three quarters of work.
The 
Wolverines 
seemed 
to 
scheme the offense a little differently 
last Saturday, letting Patterson run 
around and improvise, making plays 
with his arm and his feet. Patterson 
isn’t one of those guys who can just 
stand in the pocket and let it rip.
And for Patterson more than 
other players, the Rutgers game 
likely did mean something, because 
the way he was utilized was similar 
to last year — when Patterson was 
objectively a good quarterback.
Especially with backup Dylan 
McCaffrey 
doubtful 
with 
a 
concussion, Michigan needs Shea 
Patterson to play like 2018 Shea 
Patterson, like last week’s Shea 
Patterson, if it wants to beat a good 
team like the Hawkeyes.
Can the defensive line hold up?
In Madison, the Wolverines’ 
defensive line was pushed around 
by a mass of beefy linemen. The bad 
news for Michigan is that Iowa also 
has a stout offensive line led by two 
All-Big Ten tackles in Alaric Jackson 
and Tristan Wirfs, both of whom 
are over 300 pounds. That’s a tough 
assignment for the Wolverines’ 
undersized front seven.

If 
there’s 
any 
positive 
for 
Michigan, it’s that the defensive line 
that played against Wisconsin isn’t 
likely to be the same one that goes 
against the Hawkeyes. The 282-
pound senior Michael Dwumfour 
was out with an injury two weeks 
ago, but he should play on Saturday 
and bring some much-needed size 
at defensive tackle. That also means 
the Wolverines likely have no need to 
play Ben Mason, a former fullback, 
at the position. Mason, just 270 
pounds, struggled in the early games 
and appeared on offense against the 
Badgers, a potential sign that the 
experiment there is over.
Defensive 
ends 
Kwity 
Paye, 
Aidan Hutchinson and Michael 
Danna have looked good in the early 
going, and if they can get to Iowa 
quarterback Nate Stanley, it could 
cover up for mistakes elsewhere — 
but there’s only so much the pass 
rush can do to bail out everyone else.
Can Oliver Martin make noise 
on the other sideline?
Martin, who hails from Coralville, 
Iowa — just northwest of Iowa City 
— never quite found a fit at Michigan. 
He was buried on the depth chart by 
classmates Donovan Peoples-Jones, 
Tarik Black and Nico Collins and 
had just 11 catches in 2018. In that 

light, it’s not hard to see why Martin 
transferred to his hometown school 
in the offseason. He was granted 
immediate eligibility.
Martin hasn’t lit the world on fire 
with the Hawkeyes — he has just five 
receptions for 28 yards on the season 
— but he has a clearer path to more 
playing time at Iowa than he did 
with the Wolverines.
There don’t seem to be hard 
feelings 
regarding 
Martin’s 
departure, but multiple players 
mentioned it would be weird seeing 
him in black and gold.
“You’ve gotta make the decision 
that’s best for you,” said junior wide 
receiver Nico Collins. “I wasn’t mad 
about it. … He felt like that’s what he 
needed to do to chase his goal and he 
made that decision. But we’re still 
supportive.”
Can 
Michigan 
contain 
AJ 
Epenesa?
Google Iowa pass-rusher AJ 
Epensa, and one of the top results 
is an article that poses the question, 
“The next JJ Watt?”
Epenesa is a star. He led the Big 
Ten with 10.5 sacks in 2018 and was 
named First Team All-Big Ten by 
the media. It’ll be up to the offensive 
line — which has had its fair share of 
struggles lately — to stop him.

Fifth-year 
senior 
offensive 
tackle Jon Runyan looked shaky 
in his return from injury against 
Wisconsin, but with a few more 
games to get back into form, Runyan 
could still find a groove.
So, what will be the final score?
It’s Daily tradition to do a 
prediction at the end of these things. 
But you know what, I’m not going to 
do that, because, to be honest, I have 
no idea what will happen Saturday.
I buy that Michigan will look 
better than in Madison, with key 
players back healthy and a friendlier 
home environment against a slightly 
worse team. But it seems just as likely 
that the Wolverines win at home 
like they always have, as it does that 
they’ll allow an early touchdown 
and completely fall apart.
Using 
the 
highly 
scientific 
transitive 
property 
of 
football, 
Michigan beat Rutgers by 52 and 
Middle Tennessee by 19, while Iowa 
beat the Scarlet Knights by 30 and 
the Blue Raiders by 45. Summing up 
those margins of victory, we get……
the Hawkeyes by four. It’s as good as 
any guess I could come up with.
One 
thing 
is 
sure, 
though. 
Whatever happens Saturday, it’ll be 
a lot easier to predict the subsequent 
games.

Five questions that will determine the outcome of Michigan’s game Saturday, and possibly its season

If Michigan wants to move forward, it can start this week
T

here’s a kind of routine to 
this by now.
Michigan goes on the 
road and loses to a better team. It 
comes back home and spends the 
next week talking about a refo-
cused energy. It beats up on a bad 
team or two, calming things down 
before the next 
real opponent 
comes into 
town. Still, the 
initial loss casts 
a pall.
From there, 
it goes one of 
two ways. Last 
season, Michi-
gan ripped 
off 10 straight 
wins, including 
three over good teams, riding the 
streak into Columbus as the bruise 
left by the initial loss faded. In 
2017, it metastasized and Michigan 
went 8-4 in the regular season, the 
worst year of the Harbaugh era.
Those are the two directions 
this season can head towards, 
starting Saturday.
The phrase “measuring stick” 
has gotten some play ahead of 

Michigan’s matchup with Iowa. 
It’s a sympathetic framing. In real-
ity, the measuring stick was two 
weeks ago in Madison, and the 
Badgers blew the doors off Michi-
gan. Until proven otherwise, that’s 
the lens through which this season 
will be viewed.
But the Wolverines don’t have a 
chance to beat a good team on the 
road this week. Ohio State won’t 
roll through until late November. 
Michigan can’t absolve the woes 
of the Harbaugh era on Saturday, 
but it has a chance to beat Iowa at 
home, and that’s a task unto itself.
Iowa, as has been pointed out in 
kinder terms by many this week, is 
a poor man’s Wisconsin. The two 
teams play a similar style of grind-
it-out, classic Big Ten football. The 
Badgers do a better version of it. 
That game was on the road, this 
one is at home.
Call Saturday a barometer of 
sorts if you wish. Certainly, it’s a 
chance for Michigan to make the 
same mistake twice.
Special teams coordinator 
Chris Partridge, more than any 
other coach or player who spoke 
to media this week, painted a vivid 

picture of a program that picked 
itself up off the mat after getting 
embarrassed two weeks ago.
“Everybody responded. Every 
single person in this building 
responded,” Partridge said. “That’s 
not common when you get beat 
like that in a game.”
As for Harbaugh, the man at the 
center of the storm?
“Unbelievable how he handled 
the team and the coaches that 
week,” Partridge said. “It was just 
like a clinic, I felt.”
That’s fine and good. A 52-0 
beatdown of Rutgers last Saturday 
surely helped out Michigan’s confi-
dence and started its recuperation 
from Wisconsin. It didn’t finish 
that recuperation, though, and it 
proves nothing if the Wolverines 
can’t follow up.
The looming reality of this sea-
son still remains: every game left 
on the schedule is either against a 
ranked team or on the road. The 
Scarlet Knights were the last hur-
rah for empty blowouts. The next 
eight games are as strong a test as 
Michigan has faced under Har-
baugh.
This week is likely the best shot 

the Wolverines have this year of 
knocking off one of those ranked 
teams and a game they absolutely 
must win to keep any semblance 
of optimism for their season. That 
doesn’t mean it’s a gimme.
An offensive line that struggled 
against Wisconsin and is likely to 
be missing its best blocking tight 
end, Sean McKeon, will need to 
figure out how to block star edge 
rusher AJ Epenesa. The run game 
averaged less than 3.5 yards per 
carry against Rutgers — that won’t 
cut it against Iowa, or most of the 
opponents left on the schedule. 
Josh Gattis standing on the 
sideline is a nice cosmetic change. 
Michigan’s offense looked truly 
improved last week, but it’s 
impossible not to against Rut-
gers. Saturday will start to tell us 
whether it actually means any-
thing.
“If you play two really good 
games in a row, that would be 
a trend in my mind,” Harbaugh 
said. “Three or more, a habit.” 
In Harbaugh parlance, more 
than that might form a callus. 
That would be an uphill task given 
the schedule. It’s also what was 
expected of Michigan before the 

season. Beating Rutgers by 52 
does as little to change the goal-
posts as losing to Wisconsin by 21. 
But on Saturday, Michigan 
could get a little closer to its initial 
goal. It has yet to change, if you 
ask some players.
“We know that we’re gonna see 
(Wisconsin) again in my home-
town, for the Big Ten champion-
ship,” sophomore linebacker Cam 
McGrone said after the Rutgers 
win. “I don’t really mind hearing 
it, cause I know when we see them 
again, we’re gonna smack ‘em in 
the mouth.”
Ben Bredeson, a senior guard 
and, more importantly, a captain, 
kept things more diplomatic.
“We’re just focused on Iowa 
and not trying to make a state-
ment for a game that happened 
two weeks ago,” he said this week 
when asked a baiting question 
about Wisconsin.
Michigan can say it’s moved on 
from the loss two weeks ago. For 
the rest of us, that process can 
start with a win this week.

How Penn State’s 2016 Big Ten title proves Michigan has a path

Even now, more than three 
years 
later, 
Trace 
McSorley 
remembers the feeling perfectly: 
“Quite frankly, honestly, being 
embarrassed.”
Through four games, Penn 
State sat at 2-2, fresh off a 49-10 
dismantling at Michigan Stadium. 
This wasn’t what the Nittany 
Lions expected to be, what the 
2016 season was supposed to 
bring.
“It was a bad loss, ugly loss all 
around,” McSorley told The Daily 
this week. “We didn’t want to have 
that happen again, just that feeling 
that we had after that game.”
Outside 
the 
program, 
frustration rose to a fever pitch.
The 
third 
paragraph 
in 
PennLive’s 
story 
from 
the 
Michigan game read: “And with 
the Lions in their third year with 
James Franklin, the talent gap 
between Penn State and Michigan, 
Ohio State and Michigan State 
appears to be widening.”
Flip a few of those names around 
and you have the same eulogies 
currently being written about 
the 2019 Wolverines. Attribute 
McSorley’s quote to Jim Harbaugh 
or Shea Patterson after Michigan’s 

35-14 loss to Wisconsin two weeks 
ago and no one would bat an eye.
There’s a kicker, though.
Three months later, McSorley 
stood on a podium in Lucas Oil 
Stadium, 
draped 
in 
confetti, 
triumphantly raising the Big Ten 
championship trophy over his 
head.
Celebrating a few feet behind 
him, with the rest of the Nittany 
Lions’ coaching staff, was then-
Penn State wide receivers coach 
Josh Gattis.
So when Gattis gathered the 
Wolverines together after the 
Wisconsin game, he had a story to 
tell.
“I shared with them — as 
coaches, this is something a lot 
of us have been through before,” 
Gattis said. “I know I’ve been 
through it in my career.
“… Our players came together 
and we went on to win the Big 
Ten championship that year. So 
sometimes, adversity is something 
that you never want to use to 
bond your guys together, but it’s 
something that forms a bond, 
because when you go through the 
pressure situations, it only makes 
you tighter.”
McSorley’s 
recollection 
matches Gattis’. There was no 
magic 
schematic 
change 
or 

rallying cry that righted the ship. 
“It was just coming out and playing 
better,” McSorley says now.
The issue, then, is how to do 
that. For Penn State, the one 
tangible thing McSorley can put 
his finger on is players-only film 
sessions held by the team’s senior 
leaders on off days.
Those film sessions aren’t what 
fixed the Nittany Lions’ season, 
but they speak to a bigger part of 
the fabric of that team.
“Our senior leaders and captains 
were able to able to make sure we 
righted the ship,” McSorley said. 
“But it was kind of an all-around 
thing. The leaders get everything 
going and get everyone to buy in, 
but we needed to have all the other 
guys willing and able to buy in and 
know what we were trying to go 
and work for and how we were 
going to be able to fix it.
“So it’s kind of an all-around 
team effort, but I think the leaders 
and seniors and captains that we 
had on that team were the ones 
who spearheaded it and were able 
to get everyone going the right 
way.”
All these years later, the same 
message 
reverberates 
around 
Schembechler Hall.

HANDCRAFTED

In the last week, it’s come 
from captains Khaleke Hudson, 
Ben Bredeson and Carlo Kemp, 
but it’s also come from Josh Uche 
and Jordan Glasgow and anyone 
else who’s had a chance to speak 
to the media.
“It’s not a single person’s 
effort, it’s everybody’s effort,” 

Uche said. “You don’t even have 
to be a senior, just everyone 
stepping up, keeping the morale 
up and keeping the energy up. 
This is a team, this isn’t an 
individual thing, this is a team 
effort.”
Bredeson — one of those 
senior leaders at the heart of this 
team’s identity — said, “It’s more 
stabilizing everything. Khaleke, 

Carlo and I, we’ve been here a 
while, we’ve seen the ebbs and 
flows of the season so just trying 
to maintain and control things.”
They’ve seen a season-opening 
loss, last year at Notre Dame — 
something that’s been repeated 
ad nauseam since Wisconsin — 
and a lifeless 8-5 season in 2017. 
What they haven’t seen is a start 
quite like this, with an utter 

embarrassment just three games 
in.
Before 
2016, 
neither 
had 
McSorley, then in his first year as 
a starter.
“At that time, we had only had 
one Big Ten loss so we knew, 
again, anything could happen 
in that conference,” McSorley 
said. “So we just wanted to come 
out and be competitive and win 
games and focus on us, not worry 
about all the other things that 
would have to happen.”
That’s a lot easier to say now, 
from his spot on the Baltimore 
Ravens’ 53-man roster, than it 
would have been amid the fire 
of September 2016. But the point 
remains — everything was ahead 
of Penn State, just as it is for 
Michigan now.
They escaped an overtime 
win 
at 
Minnesota 
the 
next 
week, before an uninspiring win 
over Maryland took them into a 
matchup with No. 2 Ohio State at 
4-2.
“It was honestly just (a chance 
to show people who we were),” 
McSorley said. “Just another 
opportunity 
to 
go 
out 
and 
compete and show who we were. 
That’s the kinda group of guys we 
had, just prideful, competitive 
dudes that wanted to go out and 
win games.”

All these years later, Harbaugh 
called 
Michigan’s 
upcoming 
game against No. 14 Iowa a chance 
to turn good performances into 
a “trend.” According to Kemp, 
it’s the Wolverines’ opportunity 
to show they can “perform on 
Saturdays.”
Of course, Iowa isn’t Ohio State 
— even if Harbaugh carries a 
.000 winning percentage against 
both. 
Beating 
the 
Hawkeyes 
won’t be the sort of afternoon 
fans remember years later, like 
Penn State’s eventual 24-21 win 
over the Buckeyes.
What it would be is the same 
type of confidence boost that the 
Nittany Lions got from that win. 
As McSorley puts it, a sense they 
could “compete with anyone” 
— something they carried into a 
nine-game win streak.
“That was one of those times 
where you almost had to do it and 
see it to be able to know exactly 
what it felt like,” McSorley said. 
“And then once you got it, you 
were able to repeat it over and 
over again in the coming weeks 
and games.”
For Michigan, those coming 
weeks and games will bring 
tougher tests than Iowa. The 
2019 iteration of Penn State is one 
of them. The 2016 iteration can 
show them how to get through it.
