'U' to receive $5
million to foster
global health
research efforts
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
The University received a
$20.3 million grant yesterday
from the National Institutes of
Health to fund global health
initiatives.
The grant is part of a part-
nership with the NIH's Fog-
arty International Center, an
organization focused on global
health programs, and will be
distributed over the next five
years to help foster the devel-
opment of the next generation
of University researchers and
doctors. The University was
named a partner in one of the
five consortiums of universi-
ties, and each consortium will
receive $5 million over that
period to sponsor the research
of 12 to 15 Global Health Fel-
lows for a one-year traineeship.
The University will join
the University of Minnesota,
the University of Washington
and the University of. Hawaii
to form the Northern/Pacific
Universities Global Health

Research Training Consor-
tium, according to a University
press release.
The Global Health Fellows
will be selected from a pool of
young doctors and health scien-
tists, according to the release.
In addition to a stipend for liv-
ing and traveling expenses, the
fellows will be granted $t0,000
each to research a subject of
their choice in one of six differ-
ent countries - China, Ghana,
Kenya, Peru, Thailand or Ugan-
da.
Kate Restrick, linkages and
education officer for the Uni-
versity's Center for Global
Health, said the fellows will
split their time between their
assigned country and a consor-
tium university.
Restrick said the program's
mission is to mentor and train
new global health researchers
and doctors, adding that the
program has been parallel to
the University Medical School's
mission for the field of global
health over the past several
decades.
"Health, as it pertains to the
world around us, has a direct
impact on what we learn and
how we do medicine," she said.
Restrick said the research
projectswill vary depending on
interests, but could be science

Swider said the organization

"Healing is possible - that's

one, they're not alone, and two,
they have the capacity within
themselves even to just start the
first step towards healing."
Johnson added that it is

Daily StaffReporter
Students who enjoy relaxing with
a cup of coffee and a macaroon at
Lab Cafe on East Liberty St. may be
interested in a new incubator busi-
ness currently being developed by
one of its co-owners.
Lab co-owner Tobias Wacker and
Rackham student Pablo Quinones
recently teamed up to create dapp,
a business that will sell an eclectic
combination of handcrafted elec-
tronics cases and furniture made
from local reclaimed barn wood.
According to Waker and Quinones,
the company will feature various
crafters with differing skills and
interests in an effort to emphasize
the value of handcrafted items in the
era of mass-produced products.
"It's more about craft, care and
quality of the product," Wackersaid.
"Using materials that are meant to
last as opposed to dissolve in a few
years."
Wacker explained that dapp is

'U'prof. studies woolly mammoth

Ancient specimen

By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily StaffReporter
Rather than venture to
the Caribbean during spring
break to take a break from
cold winter weather, Paleon-
tology Prof. Dan Fisher trav-
eled to Yakutsk, Siberia to

study Yuka, a unique woolly
mammoth specimen.
Fisher and a group of about
a dozen other scientists from
various universities, includ-
ing the Russian Academy of
Sciences, examined the speci-
men over a week-long peri-
od, which was documented
by a film crew as part of an
hour-long documentary that
premiered in England on
Wednesday. An American ver-
sion is scheduled to air on the
Discovery Channel in May.

The animal appears to have
been killed by a large preda-
tor, most likely a lion, before
being butchered by humans,
Fisher said, adding that evi-
dence of humans interact-
ing with mammoths existed
before, but these new findings
help answer questions about
the prevalence of those com-
munications. He noted that
the distinct cut marks and
complex incision patterns in
its hides indicate that humans

crisis in Syria is worsening

U.N. chief appeals
to Assad to stop the
violence
UNITED NATIONS (AP)
- Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon said yesterday the crisis
in Syria is getting worse and
claiming more lives every day
even though President Bashar
Assad's government insists it is
withdrawing troops ahead of
a U.N. deadline to end the vio-
lence.
The U.N. chief appealed to
Assad "to show vision and lead-
ership" and keep his pledge to
pull troops and heavy weapons
out of cities and towns by April
10, and he urged the opposition
to be ready to stop all violence
if the Syrian government meets

the deadline.
"Cities, towns and villages
have been turned into war
zones. The sources of violence
are proliferating," Ban told the
U.N. General Assembly. "The
human rights of the Syrian peo-
ple continue to be violated....
Humanitarian needs are grow-
ing dramatically."
His comments came as activ-
ists reported that Syrian troops
attacked the Damascus suburb
of Douma, an assault they said
shows that Assad is intensify-
ing violence in the days before
the April 10 deadline. His crack-
down on the yearlong uprising
has left at least 9,000 people
dead, according to the U.N.
Earlier yesterday, a U.N.
team arrived in Damascus to
start technical preparations
for the possible deployment of

U.N. monitors for any cease-fire
between Syrian troops and rebel
forces.
Kofi Annan, the U.N.-Arab
League envoy trying to end the
conflict, said Syria has informed
him of partial withdrawals from
three locations - Idlib, Zabada-
ni and Daraa - "but it is clear
that more far-reaching action is
urgently required."
"We must silence the tanks,
helicopters, mortars and guns,
and stop all other forms of vio-
lence too: sexual abuse, tor-
ture, executions, abductions,
destruction of homes, forced
displacement, and other such
abuses, including on children,"
he said.
Annan and Ban spoke to the
General Assembly minutes after
the U.N. Security Council called
on Syria to "urgently and vis-
ibly" fulfill its pledge to halt the
use of troops and weapons by
April 10. It called on the govern-
ment and opposition to stop all
violence within 48 hours if Syria
meets the pullout deadline.
The presidential statement
raised the possibility of "further
steps" if Syria doesn't imple-
ment the six-point peace plan
outlined by Annan, which Assad
agreed to on March 25.
The statement called on all
parties, including the opposi-
tion, to stop armed violence in
all forms in 48 hours after the
Syrian government fully fulfills
the measures.
"All points of the plan are
crucial, but one is most urgent:
the need for a cessation of vio-
lence," Annan told diplomats
from the 193 U.N. member states
by videoconference from Gene-
va. "Clearly, the violence is still
continuing. Alarming levels
of casualties and other abuses
continue to be reported daily.
Military operations in civil-
ian population centers have not
stopped."
Ban said despite the Syr-
ian government's acceptance of
Annan's plan, "the violence and
assaults in civilian areas have
not stopped."

Smallest town
in the country
auctioned off
BUFORD, Wyo. (AP) -
Buford is a small place for sure,
but so is the world.
A remote, unincorporated
area alongbusyInterstate 80 that
advertised itself as the smallest
town in the United States, Buford
was sold at auction for $900,000
on yesterday to an unidentified
man from Vietnam.
It's owner for the last 20
years, Don Sammons, served
with the U.S. Army as a radio
operator in 1968-69.
After meeting the buyer, an
emotional Sammons said it was
hard for him to grasp the irony
of the situation.
"I think it's funny how things
come full circle," he said.
The buyer attended the auc-
tion in person but declined to
meet with the media or to be
identified. Sammons and others
involved in the auction would
not discuss the buyer's plans
for Buford.

It will take about 30 days for
all the paperwork to be com-
pleted before ownership of the
place located almost equidis-
tant between Cheyenne and
Laramie in southeast Wyoming
changes hands, Sammons said.
The new owner will get a gas
station and convenience store,
a schoolhouse from 1905, a
cabin, a garage, 10 acres, and a
three-bedroom home at 8,000
feet altitude - overlooking the
trucks and cars on the nearby
interstate on one side and the
distant snowcapped mountains
in Rocky Mountain National
Park in Colorado on the other.
The town traces its origins
to the 1860s and the construc-
tion of the Transcontinental
Railroad. Buford had as many
as 2,000 residents before the
railroad was rerouted.
Sammons, who moved to the
Buford area in the late 1970s
from Los Angeles to get away
from the busy city life, bought
the trading post on Jan. 31,
1992. He plans to retire from
his unofficial title as "mayor"
and write a book about his
experiences in Buford, he said.

"I felt my time here has been
very happy for me, and hope-
fully the new owner will be able
to enjoy what I've enjoyed over
the years - conversations with
people, the uniqueness of the
area and so on - and keep the
history alive," Sammons said.
As workers boarded up the
windows of the convenience
store behind her, Rozetta
Weston, a broker with a Chey-
enne real estate auction compa-
ny that represented the buyer,
said the buyer was excited to
own a "piece of the United
States." But she declined to dis-
cuss the buyer's future plans
for Buford.
Weston said the buyer and a
companion arrived in Wyoming
- their first trip to the United
States - on Monday, touring
Cheyenne and the University of
Wyoming at Laramie before the
auction.
Williams & Williams Co.
of Tulsa, Okla., conducted the
auction on a sunny, windy day
outside the trading post, which
has been closed since Dec. 31.
The number of bidders was not
released.

Detroit Mayor
Bing treated for
blood clots in lung
Detroit Mayor Dave Bing is
being treated for blood clots in his
lungs, one day after he was read-
mitted to a hospital where he'd
recently undergone surgery for a
perforated colon.
The 68-year-old mayor was
readmitted Wednesday afternoon
to Henry Ford Hospital after
experiencing some discomfort.
Henry Ford chief executive
John Popovich said in a statement
yesterday that Bing is being treat-

both lungs.
Popovich says the condition "is
often caused by a blood clot that
forms elsewhere in the body and
travels to the lungs."
He says Bing is alert and "in
good spirits."

Small plane

An airport supervisor says a
man was taken to the hospital
after his single-engine, two-

Arbor Municipal Airport.
Ann Arbor facilities supervi-

alone in the plane that took off
late yesterday morning. He says
the plane circled around and
crashed in a field about 150 feet
from the small airport's runway.
Mlive.com says it took rescu-

the pilot.
Crum says the man was "in

Gingrich's think
tank files for
bankruptcy
The health care think tank cre-
ated by Republican presidential
candidate Newt Gingrich is going
out of business.
The Gingrich Group, also
known as the Center for Health
Transformation, filed for Chapter
7 bankruptcy in federal court in
Atlanta on Wednesday. The bank-
ruptcy filing marks an abrupt
turn for a group that raised mil-
lions of dollars just a few years
ago to support and promote Gin-
grich's health care ideas.
The center's filings indicate it
has liabilities between $1 million
and $10 million and between 50
and 99 creditors. The group had
assets of only up to $100,000, the
filing said.

Gingrich cut ties to the Center
for Health Transformation and
the Gingrich Group in May 2011
as he prepared his presidential
run, said his attorney Stefan Pas-
santino.

U.K.'s Sky News:
We hacked in the
public interest
Rupert Murdoch's British sat-
ellite news channel yesterday
became the latest branch of the
mogul's global media empire to
acknowledge bending the rules in
an effort to stay ahead.
Sky News admitted its report-
ers hacked emails on two separate
occasions, insisting that it was
done in the public interest.
But legal experts said that's no
defense, the police are investigat-
ing, and Murdoch's goal of taking
full control of Sky News' profit-
able parent company, British Sky
Broadcasting Group PLC, may be
at risk.
Shares in BSkyB fell 5 percent
following the revelations but
recovered somewhat in late after-
noon trading, closing down about
2.4 percent at 642.5 pence ($10.16).

Malian rebels call for cease-
fire after capturing remote

Humanitarian aid
to return to war-
torn nation
BAMAKO, Mali (AP) - The
rebel group that recently seized
control of Mali's remote north
in a maneuver that effectively
partitioned the country in two
announced a cease-fire yester-
day, saying they had reached
their military goal.
Moussa Ag Assarid, a spokes-
man for the National Movement
for the Liberation of the Azawad,
said the group was declaring the
cease-fire to allow humanitar-
ian aid to resume in the north,
where shops were looted.
In Ivory Coast, the military
chiefs of the nations bordering
Mali met yesterday to hash out
their plan for a military inter-
vention. Deputy Ivorian Defense
Minister Paul Koffi Koffi said
military action is being consid-
ered both to reverse the coup
that deposed Mali's president
last month, as well asto preserve
Mali's territorial integrity after
the rebel advance in the north.
He instructed the army chiefs
of the 15 nations in West Africa
to draft a detailed plan, includ-

ing how many troops each
intends to send, how quickly
they could ready them and what
logistical means they plan to
contribute.
In Paris, Foreign Minister
Alain Juppe said France is ready
to help African forces on a logis-
tical level. The chief of staff of
the French army, Adm. Edouard
Guillaud, traveled yesterday to
Burkina Faso to discuss details
with the president.
The rebels launched their
insurgency in January, say-
ing they wanted to establish an
independent Tuareg homeland
in the north, known as the Aza-
wad. They only succeeded in
taking small towns until March
21, when disgruntled soldiers
stormed the presidential palace
in the distant capital of Bamako,
overthrowing the democrati-
cally elected president.
Inthe confusionthatfollowed
the coup, the rebels launched a
new offensive and succeeded
in taking the capitals of the
three main northern provinces,
including Kidal, which fell last
Friday, Gao on Saturday and
Timbuktu on Sunday.
"The NMLA has reached the
end of its military operations for
the liberation of the territory
of the Azawad," said Assarid,
speaking by telephone from
Paris.
"Since the day before yes-
terday when our units reached
Douentza which we consider to
be the frontier of the Azawad,"
he said, referring to a town some
600 kilometers (375 miles) from
Bamako, "the military offensive
is declared over."
Assarid's group is the larg-
est rebel group involved in the
offensive, but it is not the only
one, and in the three main
towns in the north, local offi-
cials say they cannot be sure
which of the rebel armies
has the upper hand. Western
observers have expressed con-
cern over the presence of an
Islamist faction called Ansar
Dine, which planted its omi-
nous black flag in all three of
the provincial capitals. This
week, the group announced it
was imposing Sharia law in the
ancient city of Timbuktu.
The mayor of Timbuktu said
nearly all of the estimated 300

Christians based in the city fled
after Ansar Dine's spiritual chief
Iyad Ag Ghali gave an inter-
view on local radio outlining the
tenets of Sharia law: Women are
to be covered at all times, thieves
will have their hands cut off and
adulterers will be stoned.
"The problem for us is that we
don't know who is the master of
our town," said the mayor, Ous-
mane Halle, explaining that the
Islamist faction had taken over
the city's military camp, while
the NMLA was stationed at the
airport.
"What I deplore is the depar-
ture of the Christian commu-
nity," he said. The city has been
honored as a UNESCO World
Heritage site for its collection
of ancient Islamic manuscripts,
propagating a moderate inter-
pretation of the religion.
"Many said to me that they
are obliged to leave," he said.
"And they are right. I cannot
guarantee their safety. And
these are people that have lived
side by side with us for centu-
ries."
In astatementUnited Nations
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
on yesterday strongly con-
demned the forcible seizure of
power in Mali. The bloc repre-
senting nations in West Africa
has imposed harsh sanctions in
an effort to force out the mili-
tary junta. Since Monday, Mali
has been under an embargo, its
borders closed. As a result, the
country is struggling to import
fuel, which comes overland from
neighboring Senegal and Ivory
Coast.
. Rolling blackouts have started
in the capital, with many neigh-
borhoods now only having elec-
tricity at night. A representative
of the state energy company said
on state television Wednesday
that they were running at 50 per-
cent capacity due to the embargo,
and things could get worse. The
government is prioritizing who
gets power, with hospitals and
military installations ahead of
residential areas.
"Mali has never experienced
such a situation," Mali's U.N.
Ambassador Omar Daou told the
Security Council on Wednesday.
"Our people are divided. Our
country is threatened with parti-
tion."

Connecticut on track to become
17th state without death penalty '

After 10 hour
debate, state
Senate votes for
abolishment
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -
The state Senate voted yester-
day to abolish the death penalty
in Connecticut, a state that has
executed only one prisoner in
a half-century and is now on
track to join a national trend
away from capital punishment.
In an early morningvote that
followed more than 10 hours
of debate, the Senate approved
legislation that would set life
imprisonment as the maxi-
mum punishment for all future
cases. The bill, which has the
support of the state's Demo-
cratic governor, now goes to the
Democrat-controlled House
of Representatives, where it's
expected to win approval.
In the past five years, four
other states have abolished the
death penalty - New Mexi-
co, Illinois, New Jersey and
New York. Connecticut would
become the 17th state without a
death penalty.
Repeal proposals are also
pending in several other states
including Kansas and Ken-
tucky, while advocates in Cali-
fornia have gathered enough
signatures for an initiative to
throw out the death penalty
that is expected to go before
voters in November.
"I think with the revelations
of so many mistakes, aided by
DNA testing, it's been made
clear that the death penalty
risks (innocent) lives," said
Richard Dieter, executive
director of the Death Penalty
Information Center, a nonprofit
capital punishment tracking
organization in Washington,
D.C.

Connecticut religious leaders who oppose the death penalty stop for a prayer
during a marchto the state Capitol on Tuesday.

Executions in the U.S. have
declined from a high of 98 in
1999 to 43 last year, Dieter said.
The number of people sen-
tenced to death each year has
also dropped sharply, from 300
a decade ago to 78 last year, he
said.
Connecticut state Sen. Eric
Coleman, D-Bloomfield, called
the 20-16 vote "a pivotal step."
"It moves us towards a
more enlightened posture on
the issue and puts us more in
line with other New England
states," he said.
The legislation wouldn't
affect sentences of the 11
inmates now on Connecti-
cut's death row. Many officials
insisted on that as a condition
of their support for repeal in a
state where two men were sen-
tenced to death for a gruesome
2007 home invasion that killed
a woman and her two daugh-
ters and evoked comparisons
to Truman Capote's "In Cold
Blood."
Similar legislation never
made it to the Senate floor for a
vote last year after some sena-

tors voiced concern about act-
ing when the second of two
suspects in that case was still
facing trial.
Two paroled burglars, Ste-
ven Hayes and Joshua Komis-
arjevsky, were convicted of
killing Jennifer Hawke-Petit
and her daughters, 17-year-old
Hayley and 11-year-old Michae-
la, in their suburban home in
Cheshire. The girls' father, Wil-
liam Petit, was beaten but sur-
vived.
Now that both men have been
sentenced to death, some law-
makers who previously opposed
the penalty - including Sen.
Edith Prague, D-Columbia -
shifted their support.
"I cannot stand the thought
of being responsible for some-
body being falsely accused and
facing the death penalty," she
said. "For me, this is a moral
issue and realizing that mis-
takes are obviously made."
Before the Senate voted, Wil-
liam Petit told reporters before
a state Capitol news conference
that he didn't think capital pun-
ishment would be abolished.

Stripping rights
Supreme court decision puts detainees at risk
ichigan is currently one of four states spending more on
prisons and corrections than on education. Now, thanks
to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Michigan's return on
investment in those incarcerated will increase, by means of greater
access to detainee's physiques. In a 5-4 decision earlier this week, the
Supreme Court upheld jailer's rights to subject any incoming detain-
ees to full body cavity strip searches without probable cause. The strip
searches, legitimized without warranted suspicions, are a violation of
fourth amendment rights and detainees' dignity, and have proven to
be unnecessary to keep contraband out of prison systems.

The plaintiff in the case, Albert Florence of
New Jersey, was pulled over while en route to
a family celebration. Police sawa warrant was
out for his arrest for an unpaid traffic ticket.
Florence had in fact already paid the fine and
even carried proof that the warrant had been
rescinded, but he was arrested nonetheless.
Florence had not been convicted of any
crime at the time of the incident, nor was there
reason to suspect he was hiding any contra-
band. Yet, he was then taken to county jail
where the jailers conducted a cavity search.
He was transferred to another jail, where he
was subject to a second strip search. Florence's
charges were eventually dropped, and he then
filed suit against the jails for violation of his
Fourth Amendment rights against unreason-
able searches and seizure.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the swing
vote between the court's four conservative and
four liberal justices, cast his vote touphold cor-
rectional officials' rightto subject any detainee
to strip searches without probable cause.
In Kennedy's written opinion, he argued
that the randomness of strip searches -
regardless of reasonable suspicion -was used
as an effective deterrent for inmates or detain-
ees against smugglingcontraband into prisons.
Limiting strip searches to only criminals con-

victed of violent or drug related crimes would
give criminals a loophole to bring weapons or
drugs into prisons.
Kennedy also argues that the seriousness
of an offense is a poor indicator of whether
a detainee is hiding contraband. Therefore,
he says, requiring probable cause shouldn't
restrict strip searches. This logic is paranoid
and further criminalizes people who should be
working toward rehabilitation.
Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the dissent-
ing opinion. He argued that in the records of
a county jail, out of 75,000 inmates that were
strip searched, three were hiding contraband
detectable only througha strip search. Of those
three detainees, all of them had drug or felony
history that would have given probable cause
for the use of a strip search.
The Supreme Court was wrong in its deci-
sion to uphold strip searches without probable
cause. Cavity searches should be limited only
to people rightly suspected of carrying con-
traband. The safety of the prisons can still be
assure as records continue to show that jailers
almost always have probable cause for detain-
ees more likely to smuggle drugs. Americans'
Fourth Amendment rights must be taken seri-
ously, especially in an increasingly violent and
crowded corrections system.

It's not always easy to toe the line
between public and strictly person-
al interests, or what one of former
Detroit Mayor Coleman Young's
left-leaning mentors termed "the
class struggle" and "the ass strug-
gle." Yet, we owe it to ourselves to
take care of each other on scales
both large and small, whether it's
with a friend over coffee or with
crowds on the Capitol steps. To
have hope of transforming our
institutions, we first need to sustain
ourselves as people against all the
pressures they place on our souls.
Our age needs more of the "creative-
ly maladjusted," in the words of Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr., and we also
need each other for the strength to
take on the world as it is.

Boycott, Divest and Sanctions

As we write this piece, more than 5,300 Pal-
estinians are imprisoned in Israeli jails. Zero
Israelis are imprisoned in Palestinian jails. A
total of 24,813 Palestinian homes have been
demolished by Israel since 1967. Zero Israeli
homes have been demolished by Palestinians
since then.' Some 172 Jewish-only settlements
and 101 "outposts" have been erected on confis-
cated Palestinian land. Zero Palestinian settle-
ments exist on any Israeli land. These facts and
many like them make clear that what is happen-
ing in Israel and the Palestinian territories is
not simply a "conflict." It's a decades-long colo-
nial campaign led by the Israeli military that
aims to disenfranchise the indigenous race and
to purify the land of non-Jews by implementing
an apartheid system.
MichiganBDS is a new student organization
that is dedicated to the philosophythat students
have the power to help end apartheid in Israel
and the Palestinian territories. This power is
derived from our ability to hold our University
accountable for its complicit role in injustice:
Our Universityinvests in corporations -such as
weapons manufacturers Northrop Grumman,
Raytheon, among many others - that profit off
the injustices in the Middle East. Our initiative
does this by bringing together a diverse group
of student activists dedicated to responding to
the 2005 global call by Palestinian civil society
for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions. BDS is
defined by a rights-based approach that aims to
launch broad boycotts, implement divestment
initiatives and demand sanctions against the
Israeli government until it meets its obligation
to recognize the Palestinian people's inalien-
able right to self-determination and until it
meets its obligations by:
1. Ending its occupation and colonization of
all Arab lands occupied in June 1967 and dis-
mantling the wall separating the Palestinian
territories.
2. Recognizing the fundamental rights of
the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full
equality.
3. Respecting, protecting and promoting the
rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their
homes and properties as stipulated in UN Reso-
lution 194.
MichiganBDS is not concerned with imple-
menting a particular state solution to the Israe-
li-Palestinian impasse. We are rights activists
who focus on pressuring the Israeli and Ameri-

can governments - since America gives $8 mil-
lion per day in military aid to Israel - to end
racist practices that deny the rights of Palestin-
ian refugees, of Palestinians in Israel proper
and of Palestinians in the occupied territories.
For example, Jewish-only roads and illegal
Israeli checkpoints are located throughout the
West Bank - restricting Palestinian movement
and freedom. Humiliated, Palestinians must
routinely wait hours for access through these
checkpoints as they attempt to live their daily
lives. Furthermore, Palestinians within Israel
are treated as second-class citizens. Israel has
more than 30 main laws that both directly and
indirectly discriminate against their Palestin-
ian citizens. One law passed explicitly outlaws
citizenship to non-Israeli non-Jews who marry
Jews. These realities are too reminiscent of the
institutionalized racism that existed in South
Africa, the United States and elsewhere in the
world not too long ago.
The inspiration for BDS as atool for resisting
the racist policies of the Israeli state comesfrom
the victory of the South African anti-apartheid
movement's boycott call, which pressured firms
that profited from the South African apartheid
regime. The movement empowered masses
in the United States and elsewhere to demand
that institutions boycott the apartheid regime.
University students were at the forefront of
that struggle and have long been committed to
divestment as a legitimate method for ensuring
that our University is not complicit in injus-
tice. In 1978, a group of students successfully
convinced the Board of Regents to withdraw
its deposits from and discontinue purchasing
short-term money market instruments from
banks who dealt with the racist South African
regime. This momentous success gives us hope
that one day the University will divest from the
racist practices of the Israeli government as well.
MichiganBDS invites all students to join us
in demanding the University not serve as an
accomplice to apartheid in Israel. Our Univer-
sity needs to divest from companies that profit
off selling equipment to the Israeli government
that is used to oppress Palestinians. We have a
moral obligation to demand that our University
divests from socially irresponsible companies.
MichiganBDS will work tirelessly to make that
happen.

ne bearded professor, 120
credits and countless lec-
tures have definitely taught
me a lot during
my four years at
the University.
And while I've
accumulated
immense knowl-
edge through
my studies, I
would argue that
some of the most LEAH
valuable lessons POTKIN
learned as a col-
lege student are
those stemming from the ups and
downs of living with roommates.
During my time in Ann Arbor, I lived
in a quad (turned triple) in Oxford,
a sorority house with 50 girls and
then a house with six girls - a com-
pilation conducive to encountering
a variety of disagreements growing
into learning experiences, which
ultimately helped me grow and learn
more about others and myself. So,
for anyone who ever has or ever will
live with roommates, I've compiled
a short list, in no particular order, of
some of the most essential lessons
I've learned over these years, some-
times at the price of friendships -
and sanity.
1. Never eat your roommate's food
without their permission.
While it may have been OK to
raid your friends' refrigerators in
high school, tables turn when Mom
and Dad aren't restocking them on
an as-needed basis. If what your
roommate is eating looks good,
feel free to ask to try it, but never
take it without asking - ever. And
if a late-night study session or an
alcohol-induced, momentary lapse
in judgment leads you to steal some
grub, be sure to tell your roommate,
apologize and replace said food
within one business day.
2. Deleting your roommate'sfavor-
ite showfrom the DVR is never okay.
Sure nearly all television shows
can now be easily found on the
Internet, but sometimes the lapse in
time between a new episode airing
and it being posted online is simply
too long. So, never assume that your

roommate has already watched his
or her recorded show. If you need
space on the DVR, be sure to ask all
roommates - e-mails work well for
large groups - before even thinking
about hitting the delete button. And
remember, just because an episode
is old does not mean it is up for dele-
tion - some people take comfort in
knowing their favorite episode of
"Friends" is only a click away.
3. Always clean up after yourself
Though it sounds obvious enough,
this piece of advice is vital. Because
having a roommate involves shar-
ing space, it's essential that people
respect their roommates' space
and clean up after themselves. This
concept may be alien to some who
are used to having someone pick up
after them at home or whose parents
tolerated unkempt rooms through-
out their childhood. When observed
by all roommates, this tip can help
roommates and housemates avoid
potential fights and confrontations,
and maintain a happy and healthy
household. Remember, there are
just as many neat freaks as there are
slobs out there.
4. Know your roommates' sched-
ules.
This is a big one, as it refers to
everything from sleep schedules
and class schedules to eating sched-
ules and shower schedules. After all,
there never are enough bathrooms.
The more you know the better off
you are. But most importantly, never
interrupt a roommate mid-REM
sleep cycle, as this can cause pro-
longed grumpiness and aggravation.
Not to mention it's always good to
know when the stove or shower will
be in use to keep your own schedule
on track.
5. If your roommate is sick, take
precaution - you will get sick too.
I wish this weren't the case, buta
sick roommate always almost means
a sick house. Take precaution: Lysol
all surfaces, open windows to get
fresh air, use a new toothbrush and
keep hand sanitizer within a one
foot radius at all times. If these tac-
tics don't work, resort to mask wear-
ing and quarantine. Such extreme
measures might be necessary to

avoid keeping a virus circulating
among roommates for weeks or even
months.
A variety of
disagreements
helped me grow.
6. Learn to compromise.
When all's said and done, this is
by far the most important thing to
remember. Learning to share space
is never easy, especially considering
everyone has his or her own idea of
what defines a suitable living envi-
ronment. So, when the garbage is
overflowing or your roommate's stuff
is on your side of the room, take one
for the team and fix it yourself. If the
problem persists, talk to your room- 0
mate about the issue and find a way
to compromise that works for both of
you. Bottom line: Failing to compro-
mise is a sure fire way to lose friends.
All in all, living with roommates
is a great learning experience and
makes college all the more fun. How-
ever, sharing space with people is
bound to cause problems now and
again, and it's important that stu-
dents understand how they can best
deal with these situations and ulti-
mately how they can learn to bet-
ter deal with people in the process.
Though not a textbook-defined skill,
the ability to interact with others
to resolve differences and maintain
friendships is one of the most impor-
tant skills students can learn while
attending the University and will
stay with them long after the names
of 18th century English poets are
long forgotten.
So remember, asking is always bet-
ter than taking, waking people up is
never OK and, if all else fails, at least
always remember to lock the front
door.

"It's a great opportunity for

Cole also said that his current
tour would be his first with a full

said it most likely lived between
10,000 and 30,000 years ago.
Fisher said he has plans for
future research on the specimen
and wants to arrange a CT scan
of the specimen so he can better
understand the animal without
causing it further damage, not-
ing that radioactive carbon dat-
ing tests were performed on the
specimen to find its exact age,
and the results will be avail-
able in two weeks. Fisher said
a future study of the animal's

Wacker said Quinones caught

Fisher said Yuka was one of
the more interesting projects

However, he said this may be
challenging due to the demand-
ing schedules of students.
"Design students and art stu-
dents often have amazing proj-

Quinones said he's excited
about the prospect of potentially

"One of my dreams is to go to

we could work together with

Quinones said he is consider-
ing searching for crafters within
the community, notinghe already
has his eyes on a hat-designer.
"There's a lot of richness in the
community in terms of people's
ideas and experience, and I think
we would do really well by con-
tinuing to have the connection to

ONE Campaign event raises
awareness for w er safety

Students gather in
support of human
rights advocacy at
UMMA
By ALICIA ADAMCYZK
Daily StaffReporter
At last night's "Thirsty Thurs-
day" event at the University of
Michigan Museum of Art, about
50 students attended a free con-
cert hosted by the University's
chapter of the ONE Campaign,
an international nonpartisan
advocacy organization working
to fight poverty and disease in
Africa.
Each year, the ONE Cam-
paign selects a different global
issue to focus its advocacy
efforts on. In previous years,
the organization has focused
on HIV/AIDS, maternal health
and education. This year's
event, which was organized
around World Water Day, was
held to raise awareness about
water accessibility and sanita-
tion conditios in devel ping
nations.
Public Policy senior Mer-
edith Horowski, the former
president of the University's
ONE chapter, said the event
was held to inform attendees
on the various ways they can
solicit change.
"The ONE Campaign is all
about advocacy," Horowski
said. "We're not a charity;
we don't ask people to donate
money, so it's all about the real-
ly simple actions that you can
take to hold our government

leaders accountable to good
development policy."
Horowski said her passion
for the ONE Campaign was
solidified when she traveled to
Rwanda in 2010 and saw the
impact of the campaign first-
hand.
"I saw on the ground in
Rwanda that the policies that
the U.S. is implementing in
terms of international develop-
ment really are effective," she
said. "These programs that we
fund are crucial in saving lives
across the world."
The event included perfor-
mances by Match by Match and
Chaser - two bands composed
of University students - as well
as brief sets from the Universi-
ty a cappella groups Dicks and
Janes and Gimble. Vertika Sriv-
astava, a member of Michigan
Sahana, also performed a solo
dance number, and the Michi-
gan Slam Poetry Team made
an appearance at the end of the
event.
During the performances,
pictures of impoverished con-
ditions:and =global water sani-
tation facts an&statistics were-
projected on a screen. LSA
junior Lesley Kucharski and
other members of the Universi-
ty's chapter took time between
sets to further educate attend-
ees on the issue.
"We're here to tell you guys
there's opportunity out there.
Progress is being made,"
Kucharski said. "We're here to
try and make (government offi-
cials) do what they say they're
going to do."
After the performances,

members of the ONE Cam-
paign passed out stationary and
helped audience members com-
pose letters to President Barack
Obama asking him to take
action at the next G8 Summit,
a conference for world leaders
to discuss international affairs.
LSA senior Mary Kate Cart-
mill, the campus leader of ONE,
said she was pleased with the
event's turnout.
"As long as we're reaching
people and we're having them
write their letters and getting
them engaged, it's really excit-
ing," Cartmill said. "We had
really great performers this
year ... I think we had a good
mix of Ann Arbor bands and
then student performers."
LSA sophomore Ryan Kras-
noo, a member of the Universi-
ty's Slam Poetry Team, said he
agreed to perform at the event
because he is a strong believer
in the mission of the ONE Cam-
paign.
"It's a great cause. I actually
performed last year at ONE's
event," Krasnoo said. "Any time
I can help out, :I'malways happy
'tWcontribute.-
Jessica Branski, an LSA
sophomore, said she's been
involved with ONE since high
school and believes the cause is
something college students can
easily stand behind.
"You can do so much with
your voice, and you don't have
to put any money in it," Bran-
ski said. "College students can
do a lot to affect change in the
world ... What's important to us
is what's going to be important
to the world later."


Obama plans to rail against
Supreme Court in fall campaig

Deomcrats to
paint conservative
justices as extreme
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama is laying
groundwork to make the major-
ity-conservative Supreme Court
a campaign issue this fall; taking
a political page from Republicans
who have long railed against lib-
eral judges who don't vote their
way.
The emerging Democratic
strategy to paint the court as
extreme was little noted in this
week's hubbub over Obama's
assertion that overturning
his health care law would be
"unprecedented."
His statement Monday wasn't
completely accurate, and the
White House backtracked. But
Obama was making a politi-
cal case, not a legal one, and he
appears ready to keep making it
if the high court's five-member
majority strikes down or cuts the
heart out of his signature policy
initiative.
The court also is likely to con-
sider several other issues before
the November election that
could stir Obama's core Demo-
cratic supporters and draw cru-
cial independent voters as well.
Among those are immigration,
voting rights and a revisit of a
campaign finance ruling that
Obama has already criticized as

an outrage.
"We haven't seen the end of
this," said longtime Supreme
Court practitioner Tom Gold-
stein, who teaches at Stanford
and Harvard universities. "The
administration seems to be posi-
tioning itself to be able to run
against the Supreme Court if it
needs to or wants to."
While Obama has predicted
victory in the health care case
now before the court, his admin-
istration could blame overreach
by Republican-appointed jus-
tices if the law is rejected, said
Goldstein, who wrote a brief sup-
porting the law's constitutional-
ity.
This can be dangerous ground,
as Obama discovered. Since
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, few
presidents have directly assailed
the Supreme Court. In Obama's
case, he issued an indirect chal-
lenge, but the former constitu-
tional law professor tripped over
the details.
Obama told a news conference
on Monday that he was "con-
fident that the Supreme Court
will not take what would be an
unprecedented, extraordinary
step of overturning a law that
was passed by a strong majority
of a democratically elected Con-
gress."
The Supreme Court does
sometimes overturn laws passed
by Congress. Obama later clari-
fied that he was referring to a
narrow class of constitutional
law, but even then Republicans

and some court scholars took
issue. What's not in question is
that the law wasn't approved by
a strong, majority - the vote was
a slim 219 to 212 in the House.
A Republican-appointed fed-
eral judge took umbrage at the
suggestion that federal courts
might be powerless to overturn
such laws, and ordered the Jus-
tice Department to provide writ-
ten assurance. He insisted the
response be at least three pages,
single-spaced.
Attorney General Eric Holder
took on that task himself, tell-
ing the judge Thursday that "the
longstanding, historical position
of the United States regarding
judicial review of the constitu-
tionality of federal legislation has
not changed."
He also took the opportunity
to cite Supreme Court case law
supporting the premise that laws
passed by Congress are "pre-
sumptively constitutional."
The Supreme Court heard a
rare three days of argument on
the 2010 health care overhaul last
week, and the court's conserva-
tive majority appeared deeply
skeptical of the key provision, a
requirement for individual health
insurance. Justice Antonin Sca-
lia, for one, appeared strongly in
favor of striking down the entire
law. A decision is expected by
July.
Also Thursday, Senate Repub-
lican Leader Mitch McConnell
had his say on presidents and the
Supreme Court.

Many people in the crowd
wore teal armbands to iden-
tify themselves as survivors of
sexual assault. Among them
was Ann Arbor resident Grif-
fin Green, who said the event
evoked feelings of support and
empowerment.
"I'm here because I know
plenty of survivors that get a
chance to be able to speak out.
I'm a survivor, and it's just a
really good experience being
able to see people get together
and fight for the same thing,"

Green said.
LSA sophomore Gia Tam-
mone said her membership
in F-Word, a feminist activist
group, influenced her choice to
attend Take Back The Night.
"I am participating because
I think that sexual violence is a
really important issue that soci-
ety still struggles with, and it's
something that women are still
very much afraid of, and it holds
women back from really living
the lives that they would want
to live," Tammone said.

Michigan faces rival Spartans Delany heating up
By LIZ NAGLE
Daily Sports WriterF ater slow start

Last year, the Michigan base-
ball team finished last in the Big
Ten conference with a record
that looked almost identical to
Michigan State, just flip-flopped.
Spartans -
36-21 - first M$U at
place.

from last sea- (Fri., Sun.),

much to show
for it.
Though the Wolverines won
a 7-3 midweek contest over Cen-
tral Michigan, they will continue
searching for Big Ten redemp-
tion this weekend against their
bigger in-state rival.
Michigan (0-3 Big Ten, 3-16
overall) will host the first and
third games of the series against
Michigan State (2-1, 18-8) today
and Sunday, and the Wolverines
will travel to East Lansing for
tomorrow's matchup.
It's going to be a tough week-
end for the Wolverine bats,which
face one of the top pitchingstaffs
in the conference. So, will Michi-
gan coach Rich Maloney stick to
the usual lineup?
"Honestly, I haven't even
thought that far yet," Maloney
said. "I'll have to sleep on this
one."
The choice seems obvious
since just three players are hit-
ting consistently, but Malo-
ney likes to weigh his different
options and experiment.
Though the top of the bat-
ting order has remained mostly
unchanged this season with its
use of the outfielders - junior
Patrick Biondi, freshman Will
Drake and sophomore Michael

PAULgans Mh/Uaily
Freshman pitcher Trent Szkutnik tnssed atoem against Minnesnta last weekend and will start tomorrow atainst MSU.

O'Neill - Maloney occasionally
mixes it up.
Against Central Michigan,
Maloney bumped freshman
shortstop Dylan Delaney from
his usual spot at the bottom of
the order to second in the lineup.
It was a bitof a surprise consider-
ing his measly .176 batting aver-
age and .250 on-base percentage,
and Delaney went hitless against
the Chippewas.
"The two-hole may be where
he ends up at some point," Malo-
ney said. "Whether we'll use it
this (weekend), we have to talk
about it as a staff and try to figure
it out."
Michigan is still stuck in a
hitting slump. Sophomore first
baseman Brett Winger especially
has been feeling that pressure at
the plate and now in the dugout.
In his last 10 games, Winger
has tallied just five hits, dropping
his batting average to .265. Malo-
ney gave him the opportunity to
"rest his mind" against the Chip-
pewas and started senior catcher
Coley Crank at first base.
Maloney hopes Winger will
come back refreshed against

Michigan State, because the
Wolverines need the extra run
support. While Biondi, Drake
and O'Neill continue to carry the
offense, the Spartans will come
into the series with an advan-
tage. Michigan State left fielder
Jordan Keur bats .368 with a
.460 on-base percentage. But the
numbers don't end there.
Spartan second baseman Ryan
Jones posts similar statistics and
ranks third in the Big Ten with
42 hits on the season. Unlike
Michigan's batting order, Michi-
gan State has consistency and
an ample supply of production
throughout the lineup.
If the Wolverines lag behind
on the scoreboard, the lopsided
pitching staffs will also play a
role. The Spartans have the low-
est team ERA in the conference
at 2.60, and no other team is in
close contention.
Though Michigan boasted a
strong string of starting-pitching
performances during nonconfer-
ence play, last weekend's poor
performance just added to the
Maloney's concerns.
After freshman left-hander

Trent Szkutnik's gem on the
mound against Minnesota,
Maloney has decided to start
Szkutnik between senior }right-
hander Brandon Sinnery on Fri-
day and junior right-hander Ben
Ballantine on Sunday.
If Szkutnik pitches as he did
last weekend, when he threw
for six innings with just two hits
and no runs against the Golden
Gophers, the Wolverines might
have a chance to claim at least
one win. But Michigan State has
found success with its hurling
trio - right-handers Tony Bucci-
ferro, Andrew Waszak and Mike
Theodore. The threesome gives
up very few earned runs, limits
their walks and has combined for
79 strikeouts.
Though the matchups don't
look promising for Michigan,
Maloney believes the key is con-
fidence. He's trying to instill that
in his team by exploring the dif-
ferent possibilities in the batting
order and on the mound.
"We're just trying to cre-
ate something," Maloney said.
"We're trying to find what com-
bination might work."

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
When Michigan baseball coach
Rich Maloney looks at freshman
shortstop Dylan Delany at the
plate, he doesn't see a player who's
struggling to find his footing in
the batter's box. He sees a hitter
that is continually improving and
one whose hitting woes won't last
long.
"I think in the big scheme of
Dylan Delaney's career, he's going
to be a really good hitter," Malo-
neysaid.
Delaney, who has started all but
one game for the Wolverines (0-3
Big Ten, 13-16 overall), has had a
rocky start to his freshman cam-
paign. Of all of Michigan's regular
starters, Delaney's .176 batting
average ranks him at the bottom,
but that hasn't stopped him from
contributing to the offense - he
has 10 RBIs and 11 runs scored.
Though Delaney has been at
the bottom of the order for the
majority of the season, Maloney
has experimented with him in the
two-hole on occasion to tryto mix
up the lineup and find different
sources of production.
Slotted behind the leadoff hit-
ter, junior center fielder Patrick
Biondi, Delaney wen hitless in
Michigan's 7-3 victory against
Central Michigan on Wednes-
day. But he did walk once, and he
scored a run.
Whether he's hitting at the top
or the bottom of the lineup, Del-
aney approaches his at-bats the
same way.
"I have no preference, really,"
Delaney said. "My job is the same
either way. I'm just trying to move
runners, get on base and help the
team win."
Delaney attributes his troubles
at the plate to a slow adjustment
to the pitching style in collegiate
baseball.
His inability to adapt quickly
might be the biggest reason for
his high strikeout total. Though
Delaneyis tied for most strikeouts
on the team with 32, his improve-
ment at the plate has been visible
over the past three weeks.

In the first 19 games of the
season, he struck out 21 times,
including an eight-game stretch
in the middle of March when he
was fanned 15 times.
But in his last 11 contests, Del-
aney has struck out just nine
times, an encouraging sign for
him.
"Early in the season, (off-
speed pitches) gave me a little bit
of trouble, but I've been working
reallyhard, the coacheshave been
helping me outa lot, and I've been
doing a lot better lately."
CLIMBING UP THE LADDER:
This weekend's series against
Michigan State might end up
being an eventful one for two of
Michigan's upperclassmen, as
Biondi and senior catcher Coley
Crank are making their way up in
the record books.
When Biondi swiped second
base in the fourth inning of the
Wolverines' victory against the
Chippewas, he collected his 18th
stolen base of the year.
With that, he tied Jim Durham
for the second-most stolen bases
(74) in the program's history.
Biondi, who has converted 18 of
his 24 stolen-base attempts, needs
just 17 more stolen bases to pass
all-time leader Eric Rose, who set
the record in 2007.
"It's not something I'm think-
ing during the game," Biondi said.
"It's kind of cool to think of over-
all, but when I'm out there, I'm
just playing the game, trying to
help our team win."
During the same game, Crank
smacked his sixth home run of the
season. Not only did it tie him for
the team lead, but it also placed
him ninth all-time, with 29 career
home runs.
Though he is batting just .200,
he has provided the Michigan
lineup with some much-needed
power and ranks third on the
team with 21 RBIs.
Crank's next home run will
move him into a four-way tie with
Chris Sabo, Mike Cervenak and
Bryan Besco.
Casey Close has the all-time
record with 46 career home runs,
which he set in 1986.

Kevin Borseth: What just happened?

n an unforeseen move yes-
terday, Michigan women's
basketball coach Kevin
Borseth resigned after five sea-
sons at the helm.
In his
final sea-
son, the
Wolverines
compiled a
20-11 record,
which was
enough to
earn their
first NCAA MICHAEL
Tournament LAURILA
bid since
2001.
The question that remains is,
why the sudden departure?
When Borseth arrived in
Ann Arbor in 2007, Michigan
had won just 35 games in the
previous four seasons. Along
with the losing mentality that
had become entrenched, the
Wolverines also hadn't made a
single postseason during this
stretch.
But in his first year, he took
Michigan to the WNIT and his
five-year tenure saw four post-
season berths.
With this season's team the
first composed of all Borseth
recruits, it looked like the Wol-
verines had made giant strides.
Going into next season, they
j were looking to stay a contend-
er, unlike the previous decade.
When senior guard Courtney
Boylan said, "Our program has
changed so much since coach
Borseth came here," she wasn't
joking.
He had sculpted the Wol-
verines into his own team, and
that didn't happen overnight.
There were growing pains -
there always are when a new
coach implements a new sys-
tem.
But it seemed the play-
ers had finally adjusted, and
the offense and defense were
developing their own identity
apart from former Michigan
teams.
That is, until Wednesday.
The world - well, the wom-
en's basketball team, at least
- came crashing down with'
the announcement of his resig-

don't know if it's the demands,
or what the case might be, but
peace of mind is important.
"Happiness is important,
and you can never question
a person's happiness. That's
something that is unquestion-
able. From that standpoint,
health is important. I told my
players yesterday, 'If I keep
going on and am not happy, I
may not make it past tomor-
row.'"
No one's faulting him for
doing what he believes is right
- even if it means possibly
sending Michigan into women's
basketball limbo, which unfor-
tunately isn't that unfamiliar of
territory.
Though some might remem-
ber him as the coach who had
the famous "rant of 2008,"
when he blew up during a press
conference following a loss,
his legacy is deeper than that.
No one's
faulting him for
doing what he
believes is right.
He turned around a faltering
program, and that in itself is an
accomplishment.
Borseth might have left sud-
denly and unexpectedly, but
there certainly doesn't seem to
be hard feelings between the
current players and Borseth.
"I want to wish Coach Bors-
eth the best and thank him for
everything," junior forward
Sam Arnold tweeted yesterday
following his announcement.
"He's an amazing coach and an
even better person!"
What's next for the Wolver-
ines is unknown. But with the
offseason already in full swing,
they need to find a coach soon
if they're going to win at all
next season.

Beilein
shares
thoughts
on Burke
Michigan coach
says reports of
Burke's departure
are premature
By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Editor
After a Wednesday full of
speculation about the NBA Draft
status of freshman point guard
Trey Burke, Michigan basketball
coach John Beilein took the time
on Thursday to address the issue
in his "Beilein Weekly" section
of the Athletic Department's
website.
In the short statement on
MGoBlue.com - Beilein's first
since an entry on March 21
which focused on the Wolver-
ines' NCAA Tournament loss to
Ohio - the coach refuted reports
that Burke had decided to enter
the NBA draft, calling them
"premature."
"My coaching staff and I have
met with Trey and his parents
several times over the past two
weeks," Beilein said. "Collec-
tively, we have gathered and
shared with each of them some
necessary information that we
feel will help Trey make the
most informed decision for his
future."
No news had emerged regard-
ing Burke's decision for quite a
while until Wednesday. That's
when the situation became
something of a frenzy.
CBSSports.com, citing anon-
ymous sources, reported on
Wednesday that Burke had
decided he would enter the draft.
The Detroit Free Press soon fol-
lowed with a similar report, also
citing an anonymous source.
Soon after, Trey's father, Benji
Burke, tweeted that his son had
not declared for the NBA, and
the tweet neither confirmed nor
refuted the notion that he was
still planning to do so.
By Wednesday night, the Free
Press was instead reporting that
Burke, in the face of the media
attention and speculation of that
day, was reconsidering his deci-
sion and was still weighing his
options.
To further muddle the situ-
ation, just after midnight on
Thursday morning, the Daily
obtained a photo of Burke's
near-empty dorm room, full of
packed-up clothing and belong-
ings.
But, according to Beilein, no
decision has been made and
Burke is still taking classes and
preparing for final exams, which
are about two weeks away.
Burke has until April 29 to
declare for the NBA Draft, but
the last date to pull out of the

draft if one has declared is April
10 - that's essentially serving as
Burke's deadline.
"The Burke family has been
very receptive to our assistance
and appreciates that we have
encouraged Trey to take his time
and look at all of his options
between now and the April 10
deadline," Beilein said.

Michigan travels to Ohio State

The two rival schools meet

purposes later
in the season,
since each team is 5-1 in confer-
ence play.
The Wolverines (5-1, 24-10)
suffered their first conference
loss last week at the hands of
Indiana, but they remain in sec-
ond place in the Big Ten behind
Purdue.
After playing at home last
season against the Buckeyes,
Michigan has to travel to
Columbus for the entire series
this year.
The environment there is
something that the Wolverines
have not experienced this sea-
son.
"The crowd there is nasty,"
said Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins. "There's no love lost
when we walk on the field."
Though the atmosphere of
the crowd may be different,
Hutchins doesn't think that
defines how Ohio State will play.
"I never get too focused on
the other team," Hutchins said.
"I don't put red-letter marks
on teams, because every game
counts the same."
During last week's inconsis-
tent series at Indiana, the Wol-
verines scored five runs over
the first two games of the series
before scoring seven runs in the

finale.
A strong offensive perfor-
mance will be needed for Mich-
igan this weekend to counter
the bat of opposing first base-
man Evelyn Carrillo.
Carrillo, the reigning Big Ten
Player of the Week, hit .722 with
13 hits, 13 RBIs, two home runs
and a 1.167 slugging percentage
last week to help lead the Buck-
eyes to a three-game sweep of
Michigan State.
But Carrillo is not the only
reason Ohio State is current-
ly on an eight-game winning
streak.
Senior shortstop Alicia Her-
ron also plays a major factor.
Herron leads the Big Ten in

home runs with 10, RBIs with
40 and is also tops in slugging
percentage, on base percentage,
total bases and runs scored.
"We'll have to be careful with
her," Hutchins said.
Just as that dynamic duo has
led the Buckeyes to a hot start,
the same could be said for Mich-
igan sophomore right fielder
Lyndsay Doyle and senior first
baseman Amanda Chidester,
who have each hit .500 in Big
Ten play.
"We're going to need some
(other) people to step up in the
order to have confidence at the
plate," Hutchins said.
Chidester and junior sec-
ond baseman Ashley Lane have

played at Ohio State before,
unlike the sophomores and
freshmen, and they know the
atmosphere at Ohio State is
unlike anything the team has
experienced this year.
"I'm sure they'll say stuff and
be loud," Lane said.
"I'm expecting anything
(from the crowd) at this point."
To some teams, this type of
atmosphere might scare a team
off and affect its play in a nega-
tive way. Accordingto Chidester
and Lane, this is not the case for
the Wolverines.
"It gets us pumped,"
Chidester said.
"(There's) a lot of excite-
ment," Lane added.

SLICE OF COMEDY
'Pie' cast reunites

TV REVIEW
Ensemble wins 'Game'

'American Reunion'
cast and crew talk
humor, new film
By KAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
Daily Arts Writer
"Hey, do you want to have sex
with us right now?" Jason Biggs
asked. "I know we just met,
brother, but there's a fucking
lock on that door, right?"
Since it would be a blatant
breach of journalistic ethics, this
writer for The Michigan Daily
respectfully declined, politely
pointing out that the windows in
the group-study rooms at Ross
are in fact, two-way, before pro-
ceeding with an interview with
the cast and crew of "American
Reunion": writers/directors Jon
Hurwitz and Hayden Schloss-
berg ("Harold and Kumar"
films), star Eddie Kaye Thomas
(Finch), and the apple pie par-
amour himself, Jason Biggs
(Jim).
It's been a long 13 years
since the first "American Pie"
launched a new generation of
teen-sex comedies and nine
years since the last non-direct-
to-video sequel, "American
Wedding." But the original cast
wasn't always keen about reunit-
ing for yet another installment.
"No one thought after ("Amer-
ican Wedding") that there was
going to be one, and the idea, on
the surface, wasn't that appeal-
ing," Thomas said. "(Hurwitz
and Schlossberg) wrote a qual-
ity script, and I know that's what
got everybody on board. It's hard
to find good movies, period, to
make. Whether it was 'American
Pie 4' or a whole other film, it's
just a good, funny script, which
got everybody to say 'Alright, I'll
do it.'"
Because of storytelling and
scheduling issues, members of
the core cast were dropped for
2003's "American Wedding,"
including Chris Klein (Oz), Tara
Reid (Vicky) and Mena Suvari
(Heather). But Hurwitz and
Schlossberg were insistent that
they and everyone else were
game before "Reunion" moved
forward - this meant every-
one, including Jim's foreign
exchange crush Nadia (Shannon
Elizabeth), the MILF Guys and
The Sherminator.
"You wanted to bring back all
thefavorites fromthat firstfilm,"
Schlossberg said. "The hope was
that once you started getting

some of the cast, the rest of the
cast would jump on board."
Hurwitz added: "If these guys
hadn't signed on board, Tara
Reid would have played every
character. It would have been
Eddie Murphy style."
As newcomers to the "Ameri-
can Pie" franchise, Hurwitz and
Schlossberg were brought on
for their dual-threat capability
- not only did the duo create,
write and direct the entirety of
the legendarily raunchy "Har-
old and Kumar" trilogy, they are
devotees of the "American Pie"
films.
"These guys know these mov-
ies better than any other human
being walking on the planet - to
a scary degree," Thomas said.
Biggs related an anecdote
from their flight to Detroit that
explicated the breadth of the
pair's fandom.
"I looked over, (Schlossberg)
puts his earphones into his
iPhone," Biggs recounted. "I'm
like 'What're you watching?'
because I'm nosy as shit. And it's
'American Pie 1.' He was like 'I
just wanted to double check the
Uncle Mort reference in 'Ameri-
can Pie 1' and see what scene it
was in.'
"When you're doing a sequel,
you want to make sure."
Schlossberg began.
"Yeah, especially six, seven,
eight months later, after the
movie's already been locked into
the can, you want to be able to
reference it on the flight," Biggs
interrupted.
"I was sitting next to Jason
Biggs, I wanted to impress him,"
Schlossberg said.
But when it came to writing
the story, the duo knew they had
to inject fresh material among
the recurring jokes and call-
backs to the previous films.

"When we were first
approached with the idea of
doing the movie, Jon and I
started thinking about differ-
ent ideas, and the first idea that
came into our heads was that
Jim's mom is dead," Schlossberg
said.
"You sick fucks. You sick, sick,
fucks," Biggs exclaimed.
"The truth of the matter is,
when you have someone like
Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad) and
you see that he's been put in the
position where he's been doing
the same thing every movie,"
Hurwitz said. "We were looking
to give Eugene (more to do)."
"It's kind of a genius idea - to
introduce death into the 'Ameri-
can Pie' franchise is conceptu-
ally ridiculous," Biggs said. "But
it's so smart and so good, it's one
of my favorite things about the
movie because, first of all it adds
some poignancy, which there is a
lot of in this movie, despite what
you may have gathered from the
present company."
Though pathos is pumped
up, so are the sex-crazed she-
nanigans that would make even
Tracy Morgan blush. While Jim
romancing a pie was boundary-
pushing in 1999, Jim running
around in a gipii suit for an
extended sequence is one of the
tamer scenes in 2012.
"When we were on set, you
shoot those long days and like,
on hour 15, I'd have a long con-
versation with Biggs," Thomas
narrated. "I'm like 'Yeah, I think
the country is headed in the
right direction, how do you feel
about Obama' and he's got leath-
er studs on his cock."
Now with kids and careers,
the hormonal teens from "Amer-
ican Pie" have certainly evolved
and matured - thankfully, the
humor hasn't one bit.

this review
going, we HBO
should get a key
piece of background informa-
tion out of the way: Ned Stark is
dead. Our goody-two-shoes hero
and famed Internet meme had
his head cut off and mounted
on a spike at the end of the first
season. That would have been a
massive spoiler, but his severed
head currently decorates a mild-
ly polarizing "Game of Thrones"
promotional poster that screams
"Look at us! We killed our lead
in the first season, which means
we're edgy and shocking and
unpredictable!"
The poster is a bit much, but
its message holds true - in its
second . season premiere, the
tale of political intrigue and
deception that captivated audi-
ences last year wastes no time
in bringing the explicit horror
of George R.R. Martin's dark,
cynical fantasy world to life.
Our first minutes back in Weste-
ros feature fights to the death
staged for the amusement of Jof-
frey (Jack Gleeson), the realm's
new king. They're soon followed
by a character that "marries"
his daughters and fathers his
own personal harem. Round-
ing everything out are several
instances of infanticide, as well
as typical "Game of Thrones"
material: attempted poisoning,
plenty of topless prostitutes
and, of course, medieval torture.
While these scenes lose some
shock value for die-hard fans
who've pored over the books and
visualized these scenes count-
less times, it's certainly flinch-
worthy material.
Yet, beneath all the horror and
blood and crimes against nature
lie the things that make "Game
