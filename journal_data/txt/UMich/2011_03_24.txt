RELIEF EFFORTS
'U' students,
faculty band
together to
assist Japan

Japan Student
* Association,
UMHS fundraise to
support victims
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
In Japanese culture, if a person
folds 1,000 origami cranes, his or
her wishes come true. And so, as
they wish for relief for victims
of the recent disasters in Japan,
members of the Japan Student
Association on campus have
begun creating the small paper
birds.
The "1,000 cranes" project is
just one of several relief efforts by
the University community to help
Japan after the country's recent
string of natural and man-made
disasters. Other student groups
as well as the University of Michi-
gan Health System have been bol-
stering support for the victims of
the 9.0-magnitude earthquake on
March 11 and a subsequent tsu-
nami with 10-meter waves. The
country is now facing a combined
toll of more than 25,000 dead or
missing people.
Engineering junior Yoshiki
Masada, president of the Japan

Student Association, said the
organization is engaged in a vari-
ety of fundraising efforts to help
victims of the disaster in Japan. It
is alsoworking with several other
campus organizations, including
the Tzu Chi Collegiate Founda-
tion and the Malaysian Student
Association, to make the endeav-
ors even more successful.
"We don't see the point if
everyone's just doing their own
thing," Masada said.
Representatives from sev-
eral of the organizations have
been collecting donations on the
Diag and in front of the restau-
rant Sushi.com to help victims of
the earthquake and tsunami in
Japan, Masada said. The groups'
fundraising efforts have raised
more than $5,000, he said. The
organizations will also be selling
bracelets and T-shirts that say
"Pray for Japan" next week in
Angell Hall.
UMHS spokeswoman Kara
Gavin said members of the health
system are collecting medical
supplies and bottled water to
donate to relief efforts in Japan.
She added that UMHS is asking
all its departmentsto collect reus-
able equipment such as crutches
or spare supplies like injury
dressings to send to Japan.

Coleman talks North
Campus issues at chat

Students express
concerns about
Northwood housing
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily News Editor
University President Mary
Sue Coleman visited the North-
wood Community Center on
North Campus for the first time
yesterday to host her monthly

fireside chat with students.
About 20 undergraduate and
graduate students joined Cole-
man and E. Royster Harper,
the University's vice president
of student affairs, for the talk.
Students discussed a variety of
topics including the Michigan
basketball team and the Uni-
versity's switch to the Common
Application, but the informal
conversation was focused on
several issues pertaining to
North Campus.

One of the issues was the new
Northwood Houses - residence
halls in the Northwood Com-
munity Apartments that were
designated for freshmen after
about 500 more students than
expected enrolled last fall.
"In the last couple of years
we've over-admitted students
because our yields have been
higher than we've predicted,"
Coleman said. "So, last fall, 500
students showed up that we
weren't expecting ... This was

something we had to scramble
about."
Undergraduate students and
resident advisers living in the
Northwood Houses - located
within Northwood I and II -
said they were surprised by how
much they enjoyed living there.
Still, they said several improve-
ments could be made to the
apartment-style residence hall.

Football ticket prices
increase for students

English, Spanish,

to be altered in fall
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily StaffReporter
Students looking to start ful-
filling their Spanish, English or
physics majors may find their
concentration requirements are

different than they originally
anticipated.
Beginning in the fall 2011
semester, the programs will have
new concentration requirements.
Most ofthe changes willbe to the
concentration prerequisites, with
some of the alterations regarding
the number of classes a student
will need before declaring their
major.
The Department of English
Language and Literature pre-

viously had two prerequisites
classes for its undergraduate
concentration - English 297:
Introduction to Poetry and Eng-
lish 298: Introduction to Literary
Studies. However, the depart-
ment decided to remove the
poetry class as a prerequisite and
instead make ita requirement for
concentrators to take a higher
level poetry class once they have
already declared.

Extra revenue
will be used for
stadium updates
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily StaffReporter
Mirroring the upward trend
in the Michigan football team's
performance, the price of stu-
dent tickets is on the rise for the
second straight year.
Wolverine fans wanting to
spend their Saturdays at the Big

House this fall will have to shell
out a heftier sum. Students will
have to pay $240 - plus pro-
cessing fees - for season tick-
ets, which is about a 21-percent
increase, or $43 greater than,
the 2010 season ticket price.
University Athletic Depart-
ment spokesman Dave Ablauf
wrote in an e-mail interview
that the price increase was nec-
essary because the season ticket
price last year was below mar-
ket value.
"We benchmarked our sea-
son ticket prices against all of

our peers and found that we
had fallen significantly below
competitive market prices, both
in student season tickets and
general season tickets," Ablauf
wrote. "We made a modest
increase to the season ticket per
game."
The price bump is also due
to an increase in the number
of home games from seven to
eight, including the first-ever
night game against Notre Dame
on Sept. 10 and the home game
against Ohio State on Nov. 26,

Republican Gov. Rick Snyder

ACTING OUT

Falling into fun

Some University students
like to take risks and try new
things, and for students in
the Michigan Skydive club,
that means jumping out of a
plane at 18,000 feet.
Michigan Skydiving
began in 2006 with just a
few students who shared
a unique hobby. Timothy
Montrief, LSA sophomore
and club president, said his
vision is to expand the club's
outreach and recruitment
process for new members.
The club recently cre-
ated a new logo, marketing
plan and website in. what
Montrief called "a com-
plete overhaul and new

approach." Additionally, the
club is recruiting rookies
and long-time aficionados of
the sport.
From December through
April, the club holds month-
ly meetings on campus,
often inviting instructors or
other guest speakers with
different approaches to the
sport. During the remain-
ing months of the year, the
club takes weekly trips to
Skydive Tecumseh, a local
skydiving facility located in
Tecumseh, Michigan about
a half hour from campus.
First-time jumpers pay
about $200, which decreas-
es to $150 after the first five

times. Eventually, partici-
pation costs $20 for a plane
ticket and $20 for equipment
- if the jumper doesn't have
his or her own - bringing
the total cost for long-time
jumpers to about $40 a
week. Though the cost may
seem high to many college
students on a budget, Mon-
trief said he thinks the sport
provides a new outlook on
life.
"I had both a fear of
heights and a massive fear of
flying when I tried it the first
time," he said. "Now I'm the
president of the club."

Children's Mirandarights
argued in Supreme Court

Court considers if
age is a factor in
police questioning
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court delved yesterday
into two cases involving the wel-
fare of children, including one
where justices seemed ready to
force courts to consider age when
examining whether a child is in
custody and must be given Miran-
da rights.
The justices wrestled with
whether a child, in this case a
seventh-grade special education
student, could understand he was
free to end police questioning and
leave, a key indicator of whether
someone is in custody.
In the second case, the court
appeared unlikely to rule that
delinquent parents must be given
a lawyer before judges can jail
them for not paying child support.
The special education student,
known as JDB in court papers was

13 in 2005 when he confessed to a
rash of break-ins in Chapel Hill,
N.C. while interviewed in a closed
room at his school by police and
school officials.
JDB's lawyer challenged the
use of his confessions. Previ-
ous court rulings have required
Miranda warnings before police
interrogations for people who are
in custody, which is defined as
when a reasonable person would
think he cannot end the question-
ing and leave.
The North Carolina Supreme
Court refused to throw the con-
fession out, saying the youth was
never actually in custody since he
had not been formally restrained
and the door to the room was not
guarded. It also said courts can-
not look at age when examining
whether the boy thought he could
leave.
The court's four liberal-lean-
ing justices, as well as the more
conservative Anthony Kennedy,
seemed uncomfortable with this
idea during the argument.

"Just as a matter of common
sense, how can you say we're
going to have the same test for
this 8-year-old as we would for
the 30-year-old?" Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg said.
Judges take into account
whether a person speaks English
and a person's physical shortcom-
ings - such as deafness - when
determining whether someone
thinks he is in custody, said Jus-
tice Stephen Breyer.
"There are all these things
around that might suggest to
a 20-year-old, yeah, you could
leave, but to a 12-year-old, 'no,"
Breyer said.
But the court's conserva-
tive justices argued that making
police officers consider age when
they question children could raise
challenges in other situations.
"If age should be one of the
factors deciding whether the
individual regarded himself as
in custody or not, why shouldn't
mental deficiency be so as well?"
Justice Antonin Scalia said.

shoppers reeling in the produce
aisle should ease in the coming

crops.
Vegetable prices shot up last
month after cold weather in
the southern U.S. and Mexico
t destroyed much of the winter
vegetable supply, the Commerce
Department said. From tomatoes
in Florida to lettuce in Arizona,
fruit and vegetables became
frostbitten,~and prices rose for

soon, though, as crops farmers
planted after the winter freezes
start to reach stores, said grow-
ers, grocers and analysts. Grocers
also typically switch this time of
year to crops planted for spring,
said Jody Shee, an analyst for the
market research firm Mintel.
"Unless there are any other
weather issues, the prices should
bounce back pretty soon," she
said.
The Iowa-based Hy-Vee
supermarket chain, which has
more than 230 stores in the Mid-
west, already is seeing cheaper
prices for lettuce, broccoli and
other vegetables, spokeswoman
Ruth Comer said. But tomatoes
and cucumbers, which were hit
hard by cold weather in Mexico,
could remain high for one more
month, she said.
Vegetables imported from
Mexico often offset losses in
the U.S. during winter freezes,
but that wasn't the case this
year because the cold stretched
further south than usual, said
Gary Lucier, an agricultural
economist with the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture's Economic
Research Service.
The result was the biggest
one-month increase in overall
food prices Americans have seen
since 1974 and the steepest rise in
U.S. inflation in nearly two years.

WMU receives
$100M for private
medical school
Donors have given Western
Michigan University $100 mil-

school.
University President John
Dunn says it is one of the largest
cash gifts donated to a U.S. uni-

the money will serve as "foun-
dation funding" for the medi-
cal school that the university is
developing with Kalamazoo's
two main hospitals.

The school is expected to open

The number of people around

he declared. He leaves behind
nations delighted by the atten-
tion but determined to use their
growing economic voice their
own way.
A day after Obama left Brazil
and two days after NATO allies
began enforcing a U.S. backed no-
fly zone over Libya, the govern-
ment of President Dilma Rousseff
called for a cease-fire.
Chilean President Sebastian
Pinera pressed Obama to com-
plete pending trade deals with
Panama and Colombia. And in
an interview with The Associ-
ated Press the day after Obama's
departure from the Chilean capi-
tal, Pinera said he would request
U.S. intelligence documents
relatedto human rightsviolations
during the Pinochet dictator-
ship - an uncomfortable chapter
for the United States because it
backed his regime.
The visits to Brazil, Chile and
El Salvador illustrate the new
politicsofthe hemisphere - more
economically viable, more demo-
cratic, with a growing global
footprint and a perspective that
will not always hew to the wishes
of its giant neighbpr to the north.
American financial aid does
not carry as much influence as
it once may have - though fiscal
pressures on the U.S. make that
aid unlikely anyway. The stron-
gest leverage the United States
has is forging relationships
based on mutual commer-
cial or security interests. But
Obama knows Latin America
has heard pledges for new
regional alliances before, only
to see them fizzle.
"Words are easy, and Iknow
that there have been times
where perhaps the United
States took this region for
granted," Obama said in San-
tiago.
Indeed, many in Latin
America thought his trip was
long overdue. But Obama
leaves behind good will in his
host countries and leaders
buoyed by a sense that his visit
brought them and their coun-
tries a degree of international
validation.
By that measure, the trip
ends on a successful note.
Obama went to the region with
little anticipation of signing
grand agreements or achieving
bilateral breakthroughs.
"What President Obama
proposed to us yesterday was
something Chile has been
assuming for a long time now
- a different relationship, to
move from handouts to col-
laboration, from an unequal
vertical relationship to a rela-
tionship of equals, horizontal,"
Pinera said in his interview
with The Associated Press on
Tuesday.
For Obama, the timing of
the trip awkwardly coincided
with American forces drop-
ping bombs and firing mis-

siles at Libya. Questions about
Libya dogged Obama at every
stop.

The White House maintains
that simply showing up can do
much to build bridges. Obama
generally stuck to his itinerary
despite the demands of the attack
on Libya, helping mitigate any
lingering irritation that he had
put off the visit for too long.
It's an approach the White
House under new political advis-
er David Plouffe has employed
domestically as well, sending
Obama on weekly visits to states
to make his case on domestic top-
ics even as national and interna-
tional issues overwhelm them.
A good relationship abroad,
deputy national security adviser
Ben Rhodes said, will yield ben-
efits for the United States over
time.
"For instance," he said, "Brazil
is one of the largest economies in
the world, and an emerging glob-
al power, and trips like this are
indispensable to elevate relations
to a new level."
A trip such as this can also gen-
erate domestic rewards. El Salva-
dor has one of Central America's
highest rates of emigration, espe-
cially to the United States. As
Obama said Tuesday night in
a toast to President Mauricio
Funes, "Just about every Salva-
doran has a loved one or a friend
in the United States -- husbands
and sons, mothers and daughters
-- working hard, sacrificing every
day."
In regions such as northern
Virginia, with a heavy concentra-
tion of Salvadorans, such atten-
tion can reap political benefits.
The power of trips like these
also rests on the lingering sym-
bolic images.
Obama supplied them. He
played soccer with children in
a Rio de Janeiro shantytown,
visited the tomb of slain Roman

Catholic Archbishop Oscar
Arnulfo Romero in San Salva-
dor, and addressed the people of
Latin America from La Moneda,
the Chilean governmental pal-
ace placed under siege during a
bloody coup nearly four decades
ago and now the heart of a
restored democracy.
Taken together, the pictures
illustrate the strides Latin Ameri-
ca has taken and how remarkably
different it is from the strife that
characterized it in the 1970s and
1980s.
Brazil has grown into the
seventh largest economy in the
world. Chile has emerged from
Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship
with a vibrant democracy and
a succession of center-left but
pragmatic leaders - a string only
broken by Pinera, a Harvard edu-
cated conservative who nonethe-
less has not sought to dismantle
the work of his predecessors.
El Salvador, still struggling
economically, has established its
own model of democracy after
the bloody 12-year civil war that
began in 1980s and left an esti-
mated 75,000 people dead. After
years of democratically elected
conservative governments, Funes
was elected as the candidate of
the party of former left-wing gue-
rillas.
Obama's trip also revisited
complicated periods of the Unit-
ed States' own history, when it
sided with oftenbrutal right wing
factions, particularly in Chile and
El Salvador. Asked by a Chilean
reporter Monday whether the
United States was prepared to
seek forgiveness for any role it
played in the 1973 coup of Social-
ist President Salvador Allende
and the subsequent repression
in Chile, Obama sought to look
ahead instead.

Harper's budget
proposal was
rejected by all
opposition parties
TORONTO (AP) - Canada's
three opposition parties said
yesterday they planned to topple
the conservative government in
a vote of no confidence in Par-
liament on Friday and trigger
the country's fourth election in
seven years.
Prime Minister Stephen
Harper needs the support of at
least one opposition party to stay
in power, but all three rejected
Harper's proposed budget after
it was announced Tuesday.
The trigger that's expected to
bring Harper down are allega-
tions - supported Monday by a
Parliamentary committee - that
Harper has acted in contempt of
Parliament by failing to disclose
the full financial details of his
tougher. crime legislation, cor-
porate tax cuts and plans to pur-
chase stealth fighter jets.
The opposition is set to intro-
duce a no-confidence vote on the
contempt issue on Friday, which
could trigger an election that
would take place either May 2 or
May 9.
Opposition parties made
inroads in attacking the gov-
ernment for its alleged ethical

shortcomings.
Last week, Harper asked
police to look into the activities
of Bruce Carson, a key former
aide. Carson, 66, is accused of
using the access he had to senior
members of the government to
lobby on behalf of a company
affiliated with his 22-year-old
fiancee, a former escort.
"This government has lost the
confidence of Canadians," Liber-
al leader Michael Ignatieff said.
Earlier, Harper urged the
opposition to support his latest
budget plan. And he called on
opposition members to explain
their refusal to support it during
a time of economic uncertainty.
"Our economy is not a political
game. The global recovery is still
fragile. Relative to other nations,
Canada's economic recovery has
been strong, but its continuation
is by no means assured," Harper
said.
Canada is likely to emerge
from an election with little
changed unless the opposition
parties join forces ina coalition.
Opinion polls expect Harper's
Conservative Party to win, but
not outright, meaning he will
continue to govern with a minor-
ity in Parliament, dependent on
opposition votes to stay afloat.
Harper's Conservatives hold
143 seats in Parliament. The Lib-
erals have 77, the New Demo-
crats 36 and the Bloc Quebecois
47.

From New York to'U'
The New York Times will benefit students
The campus community may soon have daily access to one of
the most well-recognized newspapers in the world. A pro-
posal on the Michigan Student Assembly ballot will gauge
students' reactions to the University adopting The New York Times
College Readership Program, which will allow students to pick up a
copy of the newspaper around campus for just $4 per student each
semester. When voting today, students should support the program,
and give MSA the chance to push it through the administration.

a

The proposal coincides with The New
York Times website's introduction of an
online subscription fee. Starting March 28,
readers of the online edition will only be
able to read 20 articles each month for free.
People who wish to read more articles than
the limit allows will have to pay for an online
subscription for full digital access, which can
cost more than $450 each year. In contrast,
the College Readership Program will only
add $4 per student to each semester's tuition,
which is a small price to pay for this impor-
tant resource that students might not other-
wise seek out. This relatively minor expense
provides students with more extensive and
detailed information about national and
international issues.
Ifthe proposal passes, the program -which
has been successfully implemented at more
than 400 campuses nationwide including
Ohio State University and Pennsylvania State
University - will distribute 3,000 to 4,500
copies of the paper at different drop boxes
around campus Monday through Friday. Any
student will be able to pick upa paper just like
they pick up The Michigan Daily. By reading
The New York Times, students on campus can
stay informed about what's going on in the
world beyond State Street and engage in con-
versations with their peers and classmates.

Even professors can take advantage of the
new program by connecting concepts taught
in lecture to real-world events, encouraging
students to employ their knowledge outside of
the classroom.
In addition to the discounted price, The
Times offers several perks for schools that
commit to the readership program. Accord-
ing to a March 16 Daily article, participating
campuses can schedule speaking events with
Times journalists, as well as other services
uniquely available through the program. For
just a few dollars a year, students would have.
the opportunity to engage with some of the
most established writers in journalism today
and discuss some of the most pressing current
topics with leading political minds.
If this agreement is passed, students need
to take advantage of this opportunity. Stu-
dents should pick up copies of The Times and
learn about what is going on outside of campus
boundaries. If they don't, their small invest-
ment of $4 is wasted.
As college students, it's our responsibility to
engage in global events and to understand the
world that we're about to enter. By providing
students with low-cost access to The Times,
the University can ensure that we really do
know "all the news that's fit to print." At $4 a
semester, we can't afford not to.

Tectonic plates are responsi-
ble for the world as we know
it. Without this geologi-
cal movement
of the Earth's
crust, you could
kiss the Atlantic
Ocean goodbye,
and we would be
able to walk from
North America
to Africa. Tec-
tonic plate move- JOE
ments are also SUGIYAMA
responsible for
the tragedy that
struck Japan earlier this month. The
shifting of the Earth's crust is pre-
cisely what caused the 9.0-magni-
tude earthquake - and the ensuing
tsunami - to shake the world.
Death tolls in Japan continue to
rise, as the aftermath of one of the
worst natural disasters in modern
day history continues to escalate.
The most recent estimates place the
number of missing or dead at more
than 25,000 - with more than 9,500
confirmed dead and 16,000 people
still missing, according to a March
23 New York Times article. This car-
nage can't be summed up by a few
numbers, and the horror of earth-
quake is something that most of us
will never know.
I'm extremely grateful that my
family members in Japan were for-
tunate enough to escape the disaster
with minimal anxiety. But despite
their personal safety, their minds
can't be at ease yet. They're waiting
to hear news on friends and loved
ones who may have been in the
afflicted area.
The question of what's next for
Japan is ever present in the minds
of the Japanese and those who
have watched the story unfold in
the news and on the Internet. Cur-
rently, the afflicted nation is facing
contaminated food and water sup-
plies, nuclear power plant failures
and massive rubble clean ups that
threaten the health and safety of the
Japanese.

The food and water contamination
goes hand in hand with the nuclear
power plant failures. The failure of
the plants comes from the failure of
the water pumps that are used to cool
the nuclear reactors. Nuclear reac-
tors reach extremely high tempera-
tures during the fission process and
therefore need to be cooled constant-
ly to lower the risk of a meltdown
situation. However, once the reactors
reach critical temperatures, radioac-
tivity becomes a major health risk.
This radioactivity can cause harm to
people as well as contaminate food
and water supplies.
This is what the Japanese gov-
ernment is facing. Efforts are being
made right now to cool the reactors
to a manageable temperature, but if
thoseeffortsfail,buryingthe nuclear
power plants may be the only option.
Covering the plants with sand and
concrete would be the Band-Aid
approach to the problem, but it may
also be the only viable option. Even
after burying the plants, the radio-
activity could still contaminate local
groundwater supplies and would
most likely result in the relocation of
thousands of Japanese citizens who
live near the plants.
The disaster in Japan was com-
pletely unavoidable. There's no way
to stop an earthquake from com-
ing in the same way that there's no
way to stop the Earth from spin-
ning. And the cleanup - which is
estimated to cost $248 billion -
also comes with the territory. But
Japan's earthquake precautions
have made it "the best prepared
country in the world," according to
MIT geophysicist Stephane Ron-
denay. Japan's forewarning system
- which includes more than 1,000
seismographs around the country
- alerted the citizens of the earth-
quake 80 seconds before it actu-
ally hit. This warning system - in
combination with building designs
that are meant to withstand the
shock of earthquakes - gave many
the opportunity to seek safety and
minimized the impact of the quake.

If the quake had hit an under-
developed nation, the world would
be looking at a situation even more
devastating than the Haiti earth-
quake that killed hundreds of thou-
sands of Haitians. Bear in mind that
Haiti was hit by a 7.0-magnitude
earthquake, which - according to
the Richter Scale - has about 1,000
times less energy than the 9.0-mag-
nitude earthquake that hit Japan.
It's almost unimaginable to think of
how many lives were saved by the
preparations that were put in place
by the Japanese. This preparation
is something that should be com-
mended as well as duplicated.
Everyone
should donate
to relief efforts.
The United States has literally
built earthquake preparation into
its infrastructure. The addition of
rebar to concrete block structures
is just one example of how this is
done. Underdeveloped countries
in seismically active zones need
safer building designs and disaster
action plans, which are something
more-developed nations can help
with. Such movements have the
potential to save countless lives and
should be seriously looked into by
relief organizations.
All the preparation in the world
didn't change the fact that many
Japanese citizens lost their lives
during and after the earthquake.
Relief efforts are underway, and
even though you're probably apoor
college student like we all are, I
encourage everyone to donate to
those efforts. Even if you can only
spare a few bucks, you'll rack up
some serious karma points.

As members of the Michigan Vision Party at the Uni-
versity, we pride ourselves on our accomplishments in
student government over the past few years. We are
thrilled to have had the opportunity to work closely with
the student body and many prominent and promising
young student leaders on campus. Our party's members'
involvement in the Michigan Student Assembly con-
tinues to be robust, and we continue to be a key driving
force behind many MSA commissions and initiatives.
And while we have chosen not to run an executive slate
for president and vice president in this year's election,
we remain committed to providing the leadership, ideas,
vision and results that are required to help the student
body at the University reach its fullest potential.
Our candidates for representatives to MSA have all
demonstrated unique abilities and incredible diversity in
their backgrounds and in their involvement with various
student groups and organizations here on campus. All of
them have remarkable leadership experience and a track
record of achieving results in their endeavors. Our slate
for this year, which includes six candidates for MSA, an
LSA representative and a candidate for the College of
Engineering and School of Public Policy, is well versed in
campus issues and understands the concerns of all Uni-
versity students. And their vision for where they want to
take the University next is nothingshort of incredible.
The initiatives that our candidates are fighting for
range from tackling concrete issues like Saturday Night
Dining and increased bus service on weekends, to pro-
moting open housing policies and greater communica-
tion, transparency and student participation in student
government on campus. Several of our candidates have
been the driving force on MSA behind various student
leadership initiatives, increased funding for student
groups, more streamlined student government and great-

er cooperation between studentorganizations. They have
all pledged to listen to you, as students of the University,
to ensure that the issues important to you are addressed
in a forum that meets your needs.
If elected, we look forward to working closely with
various departments of the University administration,
from the Board of Regents to the Department of Public
Safety, all in an effort to make sure that the concerns of
all University students are heard. MSA should be your
forum, your portal to the rest of the University. In addi-
tion to some of the various projects outlined above, we
will work closely to facilitate interaction, cooperation
and communication between student groups, Univer-
sity departments and students themselves. Overhauling
the MSA website and providingnew, effective interfaces
through which students can find out about new events or
initiatives that may affect them or grab their interest are
some of our top priorities. We are hopeful that we will
have the support of the student body in implementing
these new changes in order to increase communication
and the effectiveness of MSA as a forum through which
ideas can be exchanged across campus, all the way from
the Michigan Union to North Campus.
We thank the students of the University for the trust
and confidence they've placed in us before. And we
pledge that we will continue our mission to serve the stu-
dent body and students' interests through student gov-
ernment on MSA. With your vote and your support, we
will make MSA the students' assembly, and a place where
all students can see their vision translated into real prog-
ress on campus.

TO THE DAILY:
The Michigan Student Assembly recently
announced a pilot program of The New York
Times College Readership Program on cam-
pus (msa.umich.edu/nyt). While our student
assembly has yet to express any endorse-
ment to this program, they're seeking feed-
back on an initiative that would add a $4
fee to every student's tuition bill in order to
extend the provision into perpetuity. This
$4 fee would provide 3,000 to 4,500 cop-
ies of The New York Times daily, "free" to
students and distributed around campus at
various locations.
The Michigan Daily currently provides
18,000 copies each day to students and Ann

Arbor residents. Not only does this student-
run paper come at absolutely no cost to the
University community, but it includes exclu-
sive local coverage as well as syndicated
national coverage provided by The Associ-
ated Press.
It seems ridiculous that MSA is asking for
hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to
provide one-sixth of the service to students
that's already being provided - free - by the
Daily. I encourage you all to offer your con-
tinued support to the Daily by voting against
the MSA proposal to provide The Times to
students. I'm not suggesting that the $4 be
spent on the Daily instead, but rather saved
by the students or used to support other more
valuable programs

UMHS has already seen an
outpouring of support for vic-
tims of Japan - not just at the
main campus hospital but also at
medical offices throughout the
area, Gavin said.

The Department of Physics is
also tweaking its introductory
classes. In this case, the depart-
ment is making changes so the
track is more relevant for stu-
dents studying life sciences and
pre-medicine rather than engi-
neering, according to Timothy
McKay, Arthur F. Thurnau pro-
fessor of physics and astronomy.
Instead of offering Physics 125
as the class for non-engineers,
Physics 135 will be the primary
class aimed at life sciences and
pre-medicine students.
McKay said the content for
many students taking Physics 125
was often "not very relevant." He
added that classes should provide
a connection with the natural
world.
"We should have a new kind of
physics class that aims to teach
people how life works instead
of how random things in our
technology work," McKay said.
"That's what got us started on
this path."
Physics 135 was first intro-
duced in 2006, but it was only this
academic year that class enroll-
ment surpassed that of Physics
125, according to McKay. Howev-
er, onlyPhysics 135 willbe offered
next year.
The changes to the physics
curriculum have been anticipated
for awhile, McKay said. He added
that they are concurrent with
fundamental changes occurring
in science disciplines around the
nation.

Though some students may be
deterred from buying the tickets,
the student section as a whole
will probably sell out, he wrote.
The deadline for students to buy
season tickets is this Friday at 5
p.m.
Tickets for non-students are
also pricier than last year at $480
for the eight home games. Last
year's package for seven games
had apricetagof$375. Despitethe
price increase, Ablauf estimated
that in the upcoming season there
will be the same number of sea-
son ticket holders from last year.
"We have a robust waiting list,
in the event that a small portion
of season ticket holders decline
their renewal," Ablauf wrote.
The ticket cost increases of this
and last year came after a slight
reduction in student and other

season ticket prices decreased
due to economic reasons. Stu-
dents paid $200 for the home
game package in 2009, while sea-
son ticket holders paid $400.
The extra revenue raised by
the price increase will be used to
continue renovations at the Big

Relief, Inc., which also distrib-
uted UMHS donations to vic-
tims of the earthquake in Haiti
last year. UMHS already has
enough bottled water and medi-
cal supplies to fill two shipping
pallets, according to Gavin. She
added that donations are still
being collected and that UMHS
will also accept contributions
from the non-medical commu-
nity.
"It's amazing to see what
everyone's doing," Gavin said.
"Everyone wants to help."
Reflecting personally on the
disaster, Masada said though his
gan is kind of out in front on this
across the country," McKay said.
"The course materials we're
using here are being picked up
and adopted by other universi-
ties."
The Spanish concentra-
tion within the Department of
Romance Languages and Litera-
tures is also shifting its prerequi-
sitecoursesbycombiningSpanish
275 and 276 to create Spanish 277.
Like the other new courses, the
class will debut in the fall.
According to Juli Highfill,
an associate professor of Span-
ish, these changes are part of an
attempt to bring the program
more in line with the French con-
centration curriculum.
"We think that this will make
our program more effective and
interesting for students," Highfill
said.
Highfill also said the chang-
es will allow the department
to more effectively channel its
resources and offer more upper-
level classes in the future.
"We're hopingthatby reducing
our prerequisite to one course,
we can direct more resources to
the upper-level courses, and then
offer more sections. We don't yet
have permission from the college
to offer many more because of
budget pressures, but we're hop-
ing over the next few years that
we can offer more because we
know that's a huge problem," said
Highfill, referring to students'
difficulties enrolling in Spanish
classes.
Many students seeking to take
Spanish classes have struggled in
the past few semesters to get into
the courses. Department offi-

relatives live in Tokyo and were
unaffected by the earthquake,
he's doing whatever he can to
help out.
Masada said students on
campus have already surpassed
1,000 cranes, noting that partic-
ipants at an event coordinated
by the University's Center for
Japanese Studies folded more
than 1,200 in one day.
"We're not going to stop at
1,000," Masada said. "We'll just
keep on doing it."

large number of students inter-

French Prof. Michele Hannoosh,
then-chair of the Department

within the Spanish program,
there are "more combined con-
centrators and minors than any
department in LSA apart from
economics."
Highfill said this is a problem
the department is still trying to
solve.

can grow in terms of faculty and
offering more courses and sec-
tions," she said.
LSA junior Lauren Hanley
wrote in e-mail interview that
she is optimistic about the chang-
es being made within the Spanish
department.
"I really hope this restructur-
ing allows the professors to teach
more classes so that everyone
that wants to can be involved
with the Spanish department,"
Hanley wrote.
LSA junior Katherine Riley,
president-elect of the Undergrad-
uate English Association, said she
thinks the English department's
new prerequisites will encourage
more students to choose the con-
centration.
"It will definitely make a lot
more people consider being an
English major because there's
only one prerequisite," Riley said.
"After they take that one prereq-
uisite, they can really just jump
into the major and start taking
the really fun classes that are
super specialized."

COLEMAN
From Page 1A
in Northwood, said he and his
fellow RAs try to create a com-
munity environment for the stu-
dents.
"When I came up here I
thought it would be a very dif-
ferent experience," Lumley said.
"It's definitely different from
living in the residence halls, but
the community building (is still
there). We still want the resi-
dents to get to know each other.
It's just a little bit more challeng-
ing here because we have to go
knock on doors. We don't have
that community center where
people come."
Nearly all the students at the
fireside chat said they would like
some sort of community cen-
ter or lounge where they could
congregate and hang out. LSA
senior Morgan Baker, another
RA in Northwood, said a com-
mon lounge would help bring the
communitytogether.
"Seeing Northwood at its
beginning stage and the pos-
sibility it has to bring freshmen
together, it'd really be nice to
have our own common space
where you can really get to know
the residents," Baker said.
Lumley added that a residen-
tial computing site would also

benefit Northwood residents and
help to build a stronger commu-
nity.
"We are trying to figure out
ways to best serve the students,"
Lumley said. "We're talking
right now about the possibility
of getting some computers and
a printer in Northwood hous-
ing because right now they don't
have anywhere to print. Right
now, they have to go use Burs-
ley's lounge, but it's a really far
walk away."
LSA freshman Ronak Mehta
lives in Mary Markley Residence
Hall but said during the chat that
he enjoys coming to North Cam-
pus to visit his friend in North-
wood.
"I think it's a great place up
here," Mehta said. "Whenever
I come up here, I feel very at
peace. I can definitely see it very
different than living in the dorm
- different not in a bad way."
Harper said the University
is working to change North
Campus's reputation of being a
secluded area. The University
is considering freezing over the
pond at the School of Music,
Theatre and Dance for ice skat-
ing in the winter and holding
outdoor concerts in the spring,
Harper said.
"The idea is to take what's so
wonderful and beautiful about
North Campus and build on it

Thursday, March 24, 2011 - 5A
rather than fighting it ..." Harper
said. "(We're) just tryingtothink
about what's unique about North
Campus that we could do that
would make it feel less secluded
or less isolated, so you'd have
both the trees and the squirrels
and the muskrats and all that,
but sometimes a little bit of a
party atmosphere."
While the undergraduates
in attendance were extolling
the virtues of the Northwood
Houses, a handful of graduate
students expressed their dis-
pleasure with the University's
plan to have more undergradu-
ates live in Northwood I and II
after the apartment buildings
are renovated in spring 2012.
Residents of Northwood I, II
and III will have to leave their
apartments in April 2012 prior
to the building updates. The
residents will have the option of
relocating to Northwood IV or
V. Students at the fireside chat
expressed concern that their
potential new apartments could
be farther away from campus,
grocery shops and restaurants.
Coleman said she understood
the graduate students' plight,
adding that the University will
do everything it can to try and
accommodate them.
"Well, be patient with us,"
Coleman said. "We'll try to man-
age."



SNYDER
From Page 1A
Kazmirzack said the emergency
financial manager system has
been in place in Michigan since
1990 to protect citizens who live
in a financially unstable city.
The public uproar against
Snyder's plans has spawned
recent protests on campus and
at the State Capitol Building in
Lansing over the past month.
Cries of "kill of the bill" erupted
on March 8 against the Emer-
gency Financial Manager leg-
islation, and five students were
arrested in Lansing on March 16
while protesting Snyder's pro-
posed budget. However, Sny-
der signed the bill into law that
same day last week.
While Snyder has faced dis-
content from members of the
University community for his
proposal to cut higher education
funding, spurring several cam-
pus protests after the announce-
mentcthatcthe governor would be
this year's Spring Commence-
ment speaker, Kazmirzack said
Snyder is not anti-education.
"The governor worked very
hard to protect education,"
Kazmirzack said. "It is a pain-
ful cut. He, more than anybody,
understands the value of educa-
tion, but we have to get our bud-
get under control."
The financial inefficiency
of state universities is the
primary reason for the cuts,
Kazmirzack said, adding that
Snyder believes community col-
leges run more efficiently and
therefore will not be subject to
any loss in funding.
Kazmirzack added that while
the tax rate will not rise for any
citizen, Snyder has proposed to
cut earned income tax credits -

tax refunds that reward citizens "People are trying to make
with low incomes for working it sound like businesses are not

House, according to Ablauf.
"Some of the funds will be used
for the new scoreboards that we
are installing this season," Ablauf
wrote. "The new high-definition
boards will enhance the game day
experience for the fans. It will
also be used to cover the operat-
ing expenses of the department
for fiscal 2011-12."
Additionally, this year there
are a limited number of season
tickets available for non-stu-
dents, Ablauf wrote. Previously,
seats were blocked off for con-
struction, so not all seats were
available during every game.
But now that construction is
complete, all seats can be used,
allowing for more season ticket
packages to be sold.
LSA freshman Kevin Zhang
said he didn't notice the price
bump. He said despite the cost
increase, he thinks many stu-
dents feel that the increase is
acceptable because this year will
be the inaugural season for Foot-
ball head coach Brady Hoke.
"It's reasonable because there
are more games that are valu-
able," Zhang said.
LSA freshman Brian Burch-
man said he didn't find the
increase to be substantial either.
"I was like, 'I guess it went up

a tiny bit from last year,' but it
wasn't big enough that I was con-
cerned about it because that type
of price increase compared to
how much I'm paying for school,
relatively speaking, is nothing,"
Burchman said.
But LSA sophomore Sheila
Waslawski said she noticed the
increase right away and was not
happy about it.
"I thought it was unnecessary
seeing as our football tickets are
way more expensive than other
schools already," Waslawski said.
"I am still buying them but I did
debate it more."
University of Wisconsin-Mad-
ison students paid $154 to watch
the Badgers in seven home games
in 2010, and OSU students paid
$160 for their season tickets last
year.
Zhang also said he thinks, like
in years past, some students will
buy the season pack to sell their
tickets to the pricier games, such
as the night game and the Ohio
State game, to make money.
"I know people who aren't
actually purchasing tickets, and
they actually have friends that
just buy (the tickets) for them,
and they're just going to sell the
tickets and make money," Zhang
said.

Experience 'Utopia' at Penny Stamps talk

'U' alum's film
presented with
live soundtrack
By DANIEL CARLIN
Daily Arts Writer
After a star-studded week
of film shootings in Ann Arbor,
one would expect things to cool
down a bit.
But thanks to Utopia in Four
the Ann Arbor Movements
Film Festival,
which began Tomorrow at
this week, 5:10 p.m.
filmmaking
will remain Michigan Theater
a focal point Free
on campus.
Tonight, the Penny W. Stamps
Lecture Series will welcome 'U'
alum and Academy Award nomi-
nee Sam Green to share his film,
"Utopia in Four Movements."
Green premiered the piece at

the 2010 Sundance Film Festi-
val and spent the last year trav-
eling around the world - from
Turkey to Boston - screening
the film. "Utopia in Four Move-
ments" allows audiences to think
about the future in a more posi-
tive light.
"The purpose of the piece - in
sort of a poetic way - is to try
to examine the question of why
we are living in an anti-utopian
time," Green said in an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily.
"Today, most people probably
don't think that the future is
goingto look that great, so we are
examining that (idea)."
The film looks at four exam-
ples, as hinted in its title, that
have tried to demonstrate some
sort of utopian vision. For exam-
ple, it examines the language
Esperanto, which was created in
the late-19th century under the
belief that a universal and neu-
tral language could potentially
prevent war. It was a utopian

idea that may not have succeed-
ed, but many people did (and
some still do) believe in the lan-
guage's power.
Though Green's other films,
like his Academy Award-nom-
inated "The Weather Under-
ground," are presented in a
more traditional fashion, "Uto-
pia" acts as a theatrical perfor-
mance and a film. Green narrates
each screening live alongside
Brooklyn-based band The Qua-
vers and sound artist/musician
David Cerf who synthesizes the
live documentary's soundtrack
together. Ann Arbor's perfor-
mance will also feature Brendan
Canty on the drums, who is noto-
rious for his association with the
punk-rock band Fugazi.
While "Utopia" is breaking the
mold of the familiar film-going,
Green is not pretentious or even
stuffy about this experimental
way of sharing cinema.
"I am excited to do this in the
Penny Stamps lecture because

this is a fancy-ass lecture, you
know?" Green said. "When's
the last time you saw someone
give a lecture and saw them
bring their own live band to do a
soundtrack?"
Green first became interested
in filmmaking while at the Uni-
versity. As a student of the Resi-
dential College, he spent time
working for a group called Mich-
igan Media, which consisted of
students going into classrooms
and lectures to help set up pro-
jectors and other equipment to
share multimedia with students.
Though the technology at the
University has developed since
Green's time here, he is still
interested in the connection
between live engagement and
multimedia.
"Live performance made me
realize that in the world today, as
a filmmaker, you need to accept
that people are going to watch
your films on a laptop while
checking their email - where

a

people don't need to give their
full attention," Green said.
With limited distractions for
moviegoers, Green hopes view-
ers will experience the content
in a new and exciting way.
"I love the theatrical experi-

ence of going to a theater, sitting
with strangers, lights go down
and the magic of the cinema,"
Green said. "You lose yourself
in something. I wanted to make
something that would be seen in
a theatrical context."

Hoke sees plenty of room for Coaches create competitive
improvement, Vinopal gone atmosphere at spring practice

Hopkins getting
time at fullback,
Woolfolk and Floyd
making progress
By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
With just three spring prac-
tices under his belt and only one
in which he saw his new players
in pads, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke was asked
to estimate the NOTEBOOK
gap between
where the Michigan football
team was, as of Wednesday, and
where he wants it to be.
"That's a huge gap, I don't
know," Hoke said, pausing brief-
ly.
"Grand Canyon-sized right
now," he continued. "That's
nothing that's shocking right
now to us. And they're hun-
gry, like I said, they want to be
coached. They want to do it the
right way."
This spring, Hoke and his
assistants are focusing on a
combination of implanting new
schemes and teaching the funda-
mentals Hoke wants his athletes
to play with.
Transitioning to the 4-3
defense and the pro-style offense
has been a process early on.
"When you're installing an
offense or defense, there's always
a little paralysis by analysis as far
as somethinking going on," Hoke
said. "New terminology and all
of those kind of things - plays
being a little bit different, tech-
nique being a little bit different ...
We're not playing as near as fast
as we need to yet, but I wouldn't
expect it."
No matter how much the
growing pains hurt, Hoke
expects everyone to play with
toughness and effort - as those
are the constants players can
control at this point. As for the
speed of their play, that paralysis
is something that Hoke assured
would work itself out. He said
* the team wasn't playing nearly
as quickly as he expects it to play.
One player who hasn't slowed
down is quarterback Denard
Robinson. Hoke said that the
signal caller and backup Devin
Gardner were beginning to
pick up the nuances of the new
offense.
"I think they both have done a
good job," Hoke said. "And both
are very capable of being tre-
mendous quarterbacks in this
offense."
The transition has been pretty
much a smooth one, if not for a
few speed bumps along the way.
"There's an issue with foot-
work at times, you try and rush
yourself in a drop off of play-
action or something like that,"

for much of the 2010 season.

wide receiver and safety, accord-
ing to Hoke.
And through three spring
practices, teammates are already
starting to embrace the environ-
ment.
After Tuesday's practice -
Michigan's first in full pads -
defensive end Ryan Van Bergen
bragged during a video inter-
view with MGoBlue.com that he
sacked Robinson in each of their
first three practices.
"Three-for-three - all three
practices I got a sack," Van Ber-
gen said with Robinson within
earshot.
"It reminds me
of one of those
Under Armour
commercials."
"You did not get me yes-
terday," Robinson chimed in.
"Today you got me because I
made Mike Martin miss and you
got me."
"Trying to step up in a pocket
that wasn't there," Van Bergen
responded.
"No, I shook Mike Martin and
you came and got me," Robinson
said, eyes widening in disbelief.
"No - false," Van Bergen
quipped to the camera. "Three-
for-three (on) Denard Robinson.
Oh-for-three for him. Three-for-
three is not as impressive as oh-
for-three for him."
"Where's Mike? Where's
Mike," Robinson said, smiling,
as he walked away.
At least Mattison's defense
has won at least a few battles
against Robinson this spring.

Hoke added. "But both of those
guys have handled it pretty well."
The quarterbacks' progres-
sion will be important to keep an
eye on. And by the end of the 15
spring practices, Hoke probably
still won't be satisfied with his
team's progress as a whole.
"We'll never be where I want
us to be, period," Hoke said. "I
know me. I think it's pretty typi-
cal of the last two places that
we've started. At Ball State and
San Diego State, there's a point
where you have to start and
you've got a vision of where you
want to finish. I think it always
takes a little bit of time during
the spring to move the dial."
SEE YOU LATER, 'PAL: Hoke
announced that sophomore safe-
ty Ray Vinopal is officially no
longer with the team.
"Ray decided to go back to
Youngstown, (Ohio)," Hoke said.
"That issue is more of a family
issue."
Vinopal was moved into the
starting lineup when Michigan
played Penn State last season
after the Wolverines' bye week
- he started the final six games
of the season, totaling 33 tackles,
L5 tackles-for-loss and one inter-
ception on the year.
HOP ON UP: Sophomore
running back Stephen Hop-
kins - the biggest running back
Michigan had last year at 6-foot,
227 pounds - has been play-
ing "part-time" at fullback this
spring.
"We don't have a lot of full-
backs," Hoke said. "We have one,
really, with that type of body on
the team in (John McColgan).
Hop's doing some of it, and some
of the split back stuff that we
do, a lot of the old 49ers' stuff, it
really works out well with that
type of guy."
Hopkins was used as a goal-

line back under Rich Rodriguez
and rushed for 151 yards on 37
carries, for an average of 4.1
yards per carry, with four rush-
ing touchdowns in 2010. Hoke
wants his fullbacks to fit a cer-
tain mold.
"He's got to be a guy who
comes in 6-(foot)-3 and leaves
the program about 6-(foot)-1,"
Hoke said, referringto the physi-
cal grind it takes to play the posi-
tion. "Every Wisconsin fullback
I've seen, they get shorter as the
years go on."
SPRING FLING: This year's
spring game, set for April16, may
not look like a typical game, as
Hoke warned on Wednesday.
"We wouldn't play a (real)
game," Hoke said. "We have a lot
of situational scrimmage stuff.
And we've got (24) more days
until that spring game date. Just
in different experiences, I doubt
we'll play a game, game. (I'd)
like to, but we don't have enough
depth."
He added that he hopes to
have 50 to 60 percent of the
schemes installed by the end of
spring, with the remainder com-
ing in fall camp.
INJURY UPDATES: Running
back Mike Shaw has been taking
part in alternate conditioning,
Hoke said. Shaw broke his hand
before spring practice started
and is expected to be able to do
a little more, with a cast on, next
week. ... Center David Molk has
been hampered by a hamstring
injury, relegating Rocko Khoury
to take the majority of the snaps
at center - Molk is expected to
be fine by next Tuesday. ... Hoke
also commented on the status
of cornerbacks Troy Woolfolk
and J.T. Floyd. Woolfolk is doing
some group work and certainly
not everything yet. And Floyd is
further behind than Woolfolk.

zoo to Ann Arbor, bringint his experience to help Michigan's youthful post game.

shows, traveling to 13 countries.
But an aching body told him it was
time to transition into something
new.
That 'something new' led him
back to his roots at the UDM,
where, after two months as the
director of basketball operations,
he was promoted to an assistant
coaching position.
He spent six seasons there
before moving to Ohio Univer-
sity and becoming an assistant
coach on a team that took part in
the inaugural CBI Tournament in
2008.
In 2008, Alexander transi-
tioned to the MAC conference
and became an assistant coach at
Western Michigan University.
In his first year in Kalamazoo,
the Broncos featured a roster of
16 players, eight of whom were
freshmen. There was only one
returning post player with sig-
nificant playing time the previous
season.
"Through a labor of work and
love, we were able to develop
those guys to become contribu-
tors in the first year and then
forces in the second year," Alex-
ander said. "So as you're devel-
oping (Michigan's post players)

and using the methodology that,
quite frankly, we used at Western
Michigan, it's really boded well
for our young bigs."
It was with the Broncos that
Alexander began to solidify his
post coaching philosophy. He
decided that the most important
aspect in coaching was establish-
ing a superior work ethic within
each player.
"A lot of times athletes want
to be really good players but it's
always a tremendous challenge
to learn the level of intensity that
it takes to achieve those goals,"
Alexander said. "I tell our play-
ers all the time, 'Don't mistake
intensity for anger. Just because
I have a scowl on my face and I
have a volume on the delivery of
my words doesn't mean that I'm
upset at you fellas.
"It just means that we're trying
to establish a mentality in terms
of the approach that you have to
take each and every day on the
practice court.'"
He would transition from
Kalamazoo to Ann Arbor easily
by bringing with him his experi-
ence to a very similar situation.

Alexander didn't personally
know Beilein when his phone
number appeared on Alexan-
der's cell phone that afternoon.
Beilein had called to talk about
a job opening at the University
of Michigan. That phone call led
to an in-person interview where
Alexander ran a full workout for
Beilein's son, Patrick.
"I was looking for, first of all,
a big-man coach," coach Beilein
said. "When you're small and ...
you're effective as a big man, you
know a lot of the trade secrets. I
could sense that right away. Then
I ended up talking with his former
head coaches, Tim O'Shea and
Steve Hawkins, they both said the
same thing. And then I just loved
his energy, his personality when
he came to his interview.
"I could tell right away he was a
very good teacher."
Alexander was offered the job
and knew he would be coming
into nearly the same situation as
when he was an assistant at West-
ern Michigan.
The Wolverines had two red-
shirt freshmen forwards, Morgan
and Blake McLimans, but beyond
that, it was a slew of freshmen.
The heavy task of taking these
players and turning them into Big
Ten contenders was placed on the
broad shoulders of Alexander.
He immediately took to the
players and brought an intensity
that few had ever seen in a coach
before.
"He always says he'd never
make us do anything that he
hasn't done himself, so he's basi-
cally just trying to make us in his
image," Horford said. "Having
strong post play is crucial to any
team that wants to have great suc-
cess like the success we're looking
for."
Morgan added: "He tries to
have a different approach about
everything. He finds a way to
make doing good things fun. You
do a lot of good things to be a
great player. And he finds a way to
break everything down and make
it real simple for you."
With the true freshmen, Alex-
ander taught them the what's,
how's and why's of being a Divi-
sion-I basketball player. But with
McLimans and Morgan, Alex-
ander focused more on teaching
them the when's and the where's,
since they were expected to see

Daily Sports Editor
the most game time.
With each player, he brought
game-like intensity to every prac-
tice and every game.
"My personal belief is that you
win games in practices," Alexan-
der said. "Practice is the process
that takes care of the outcome. So
for me to stand onthe sideline and
not give a 'yes face' to our play-
ers is really a recipe for disaster
on some levels when you have a
young developing talent of guys
that are trying to establish confi-
dence consistently forthemselves.
"So I'm always sitting over
there with a 'yes face,' apat on the
back, a smile, awink, you know, or
even some laughter, just to break
up the mood and keep it light."
When Alexander was at UDM
he wore the jersey No. 34. He said
he wanted to pick a number that
great, tough players like Charles
Barkley once wore.
It was a big deal to him because
he also believed that the number
was lucky - the two numbers
added up to seven.
And while he doesn't wear the
uniform number anymore on the
sidelines, the coach is still con-
cerned with his attire.
It may have started as a joke,
but now Alexander is a four-time
winner of CollegeInsider.com's
Runway to the Fashionable Four
- the only coach in the country
to do so.
He said that his game-day
decorum is more aboutbeing pos-
itive than about what he wears,
but he admits that his wife does
pick out his suits for the game
because it's important to always
look put together.
"(You must) not only dress
for where you're at, but dress for
where you're trying to go," Alex-
ander said.
At this point, none of the Wol-
verines wear No. 34 and Alexan-
der jokes that "they still have to
earn their stripes and the jury is
still out" on whether any deserve
to wear his historic number.
But perhaps after a season that
saw the Wolverines' post group@

Trip to St. Louis takes Berenson down memory lane

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily SportsEditor
Seventeen days ago, Michigan
coach Red Berenson stepped onto
the ice at Scottrade Center to drop
the puck for the opening faceoff
between the St. Louis Blues and
the Columbus Blue Jackets.
It was the curtain closing on
Berenson's illustrious career with
the Blues -'Salute to No. 7.'
Alongside the 17-year NHL vet-
eran stood three other legendary
No. 7s: Garry Unger, Joe Mullen
and Keith Tkachuk.
But just as the last strains of
light vanished from behind the
curtains in St. Louis, the 'Red
Baron' burst back onto center
stage.
Friday, Berenson and the No. 6
Michigan hockey team will tangle
with No. 14 Nebraska-Omaha in
the opening round of the NCAA
West Regional. The matchup will
be the Wolverines' first ever inSt.
Louis.
Though the Gateway City rolled
out the red carpet for the veteran
coach last time, there certainly
will be no homecoming party this
time around - that's Berenson's
initiative.

tED MOCH/Daily
Michigan coach Red Berenson returns to St. Louis this weekend, where he was
an All-Star caliber forward for the Blues.

As a player who took his knocks
in the NHL and saw time as both
a fourth-line player and a six-time
All-Star, Berenson has carried
his experience into his tenure as
coach of the Wolverines.
"I was up and down," Berenson
said. "I can relate to players that
aren't having success, and I can
relate to our players that are hav-
ing success."
Added senior forward Louie

Caporusso: "(Berenson) shows no
signs of slowing down. He's the
most intense person in the rink
every time there's a game. We feed
off him. His pregame talks and
some of the things he says are very
inspirational - you can't ask for a
better coach."
In St. Louis this weekend,
Berenson hopes to close the cur-
tains with a pair of wins, and not
get sent home singingthe blues.


TRASENDING
.THE BLU EPRI NT

UNIVERSITY'S ELUSIVE
ARCHITECTURE PROGRAM

fter you ride the bus to North Campus, find Bonisteel Boulevard,
enter the Art and Architecture Building and climb three sets of
stairs, an exclusive world unfolds in the form of an expanse of desk
areas. Bodies spot the space that flows with natural light pouring
from the grand windows, paper cutouts hanging, colored Christmas lights
wrapping around the floor-to-ceiling beams, Aunt Jemima bottles, wooden
paddles, glue, Vitamin Waters, coffee, chargers and beanies cluttering the
area with trendiness - this is their living space.
"The relatively insular nature of architecture schools is reinforced by (our
school's) location on North Campus at (the) University of Michigan," said
Prof. John McMorrough, the chair of the department. "What's unique in the
institutional setting... is a lot of work happens in the building.
"This is where they do their homework, this is where they're doing the
designs of the building, they're drawing- and soit treates alivingsituation,
almost," he added. "Sometimes they sleep up there, but they're not supposed
to. So it just creates a kind of intensity."
The architecture school, a part of the Taubman College of Architecture and
Urban Planning, is not just ahidden and intriguing aesthetic place, but a place
for a kind ofthinkingthat teeters toward philosophy. McMorrough began his
position at the University in September 2010 and wants the program to not
only be about realizing buildings, but also about realizing that "architecture
is a form of thinking more than just a form of thinking about a thing."
Entering the studio
The Architecture program's acceptance rate from 2010 to 2011 is surpris-
ingly high at 94 percent, but there is an explanation for this. The students
can apply as incoming freshmen or in the winter term of their sophomore
year after getting a letter of recommendation, writing a 500-word statement
of purpose and creating an impressive portfolio of their work, predominant-
ly derived from the pre-Architecture studio courses ARCH 201, 202 and 218
- not the easiest of tasks.
Once they get in, Architecture students are quickly submerged into the
studio culture. Junior Hannah Hunt Moeller gave the low-down.
"I feel like the word 'studio' gets thrown around a lot and not always in
the same way," she said. "Studio is like, 'Are you going to studio?' - like the
place where you're actually working in your desk. But it's also like the studio
that is broken up within your class or your cohort."
The teachers of each particular studio quickly establish personal relation-
ships with their students because of the small but fierce work environment.
Moeller explained that there are three levels of evaluation in the program:
the desk crits, the pin-ups and the review. These are Michigan Architec-
ture's forms of feedback.
The least serious of the three is the desk crits, in which students bene-
fit from casual discussions with faculty about their current project. In the
less-frequent pin-ups, students literally pin their drawings on the wall with
pins and discuss them. The semester reviews, also referred to as critics, are
essentially final exams to the rest of the academic world. In them, the stu-
dents read an extensive essay about their semester-long project to other stu-
dents and professors. These reviewers are able to subsequently challenge the
presenter and foster back-and-forth discussion.
"The reviews do have a performative quality," McMorrough said. "You
get up, it's kind of a rhetorical thing ... probably our most public sort of mani-
festation of something that's really pretty private a lot of the time."
There is a comprehensive progression up to the students' final term - for
the Masters students this means a big "thesis;" for the undergraduates this
means a final project called a Wallenberg Studio. These studios are funded,
dealing with socially relevant topics. McMorrough said those are the pro-
gram's capstones.
Finding (or not finding) the balance
Second-year graduate student Kyle Sturgeon went as far as to call the
physical studio in the third-floor space "the arena, the Coliseum," architec-
ture humor fully intact. According to Sturgeon, the students want to be at
the studio instead of working in their homes because the space allows help-
ful conversation between peers and provides for surrounding motivation.
"The studio culture sort of fuses your personal life and your work," Stur-
geon said.
However, Sturgeon admitted that the studio can be like an addiction.
"It's kind of like nicotine in a way, it's a smoke break," he added. "You're
there,you're working, it's really intense, its really hard ... you're pushingyour-
self and you're uncomfortable where you're going, but you have lots of people
doing the same thing and you know how to blow off steam, you know?"
And most Architecture students appreciate the dualistic culture of the
studio as Sturgeon does.
But there is another struggle that comes with the intense nature of the
* architecture program, particularlyin the process ofgettinga Masters degree.
Sturgeon verbalized specific examples of what he gives up in the program.
"I used to work out every day and I used to love to cook and photograph
food," he said. "Always going hard, but I'm in graduate school mode so just
bangit out. I know I'm all there still. Like all of me is still there, but right now
it's like working on a part of it."
Even if his life is a bit more unbalanced, at least all of his personality is
still there. Yet Sturgeon does believe that architecture studies aren't quite as
difficult as one might imagine.

mysticism of a time-honored quadrangle and gauge student perspectives on the
University's architectural landscape.

Regal and legal Law Quad

Springtime
for poets

The story behind
the serene and
majestic complex
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily Arts Writer
Regardless of the season, there
are always plenty of students
walking through the grassy (or
snow-covered) area of the Law
Quadrangle. People have long
been fascinated with the beauty
of its mystical architecture.
Consisting of four main build-
ings - the Lawyer's Club, the
John P. Cook Dormitory, the
Legal Research Library and
Hutchins Hall - the Law Quad
has held a long and storied his-
tory, with the construction of the
first of the buildings dating back
to 1925 and the latest one having
been completed in 1933.
First-year Law student Wen-
cong Fa finds both the beauty and
history of the Quad mesmerizing.
"I've seen pictures of it before
I came here, but it was better
than anything I could have imag-
ined," Fa said.
One of his favorite places in the
Law Quad is the arch leading to
the dining hall, since it serves as
agreat connecting space between
the Law community and the rest
of the University.
Fa finds the Law Quad's inclu-
siveness very convenient.
"It's an amazing place," he
said. "I like how it prompts you
to get a lot closer to everyone.
This is one of the reasons why
we have such a tight-knit com-
munity at Michigan Law - you
see your classmates, you see
your professors. Everyone is
really accessible since you see
them all the time."
For second-year Law student
Justin Benson, this all-inclusive
design captures the intellectual
energy of the Law School.
"Wherever you go, you can feel
that energy," he said.
His favorite spot in the Quad
is the Reading Room, both for its

aestheticism and the muse it pro-
vides him, particularly when he
is studying for hours on end.
The first time he set eyes on the
Quad, Benson was an undergrad-
uate student at the University. He
used the intriguing qualities of
the Quad as motivation to work
hard so he could have the oppor-
tunity to be a Law student in such
an inspirational area.
"(The Law Quad) is old and
beautiful, and I think that's what
makes it an appropriate space to
become a lawyer," Benson said.
"You are surrounded by extreme-
ly bright and engagingcolleagues
and being around these people
and the Quad's beauty is what
makes it so conductive to the
study of law."
For J.S.D. candidate Tianlong
Hu, the fascination with the
quadrangle has more to do with
the smaller things.
As an international student
from China, he served as a recep-
tionist for Chinese visitors and
has found the main attraction to
the Quad are the minor details -
usually looked over by most.
"They are more interested in
seeing the soft parts, like those
window glasses on Hutchins Hall

or those little sculptures in the
building walls," Hu said.
He said these soft details
even inspired a legal historian
at Peking University Law School
in China to improve the campus
courthouse with decorations
inspired by what he saw in the
University's Law Quad.
"People usually (overlook)'
small details and don't pay atten-
tion to them, but visitors show a
different viewpoint," he said.
Another aspect that is very
impressive to international visi-
tors, Hu said, is the modern func-
tionality of the old buildings.
"They are surprised to see how
the buildings that are 80 years
old are able to incorporate mod-
ern technology like elevators," he
said.
The concept behind the Law
Quad's classic construction has
its roots in the 1400s, when the
leaders of Cambridge's King's
College in England had a philoso-
phy of designing a school with
everything included in the same
site. The Law Quad's design was
inspired by such a concept.
A quadrangle by definition is
a space or courtyard usually in
the shape of a square or rectangle
whose sides are walls of build-
ings. Though the design was very
common in European colleges,
American universities prefer to
have multiple college buildings
spread across campus.
University Planner Sue Gott
said the University's Law Quad
took this understanding to build
an all-inclusive residential,
learning and research environ-
ment through a gothic revival for
the University's Law students.
The buildings comprising the
quad were built in a variety of
related styles, including English,
Elizabethan and gothic. They
also have classical features, with
Greek revival themes snuck in
throughout the complex. The
quad itself includes a number of
details, including six sculptured
corbels crouching at the main
entrances that have the faces of
prominent past University presi-

dents James Angell, Marion
Burton, Henry Frieze, Erastus
Haven, Harry Hutchins and
Henry Tappan.
Even for those who aren't
familiar with the history of ear-
lier colleges, the quad provokes a
sense of awe in most spectators
far and near.
"It's simply a magical and
inspiring setting because it is
unique and not typical to other
areas of campus and even other
campuses across the country,"
Gott said.
Gott said the Law Quad's
beauty and early design are
planned to be maintained as the
complex adapts to building codes
and makes use of state-of-the-art
construction methods.
"We will always be evolving
and adapting but certainly pursu-
ing (the Quad's) integrity," Gott
said. "Any new or future devel-
opment would be sensitive with a
compatible design."
Back in the 1990s, develop-
ments included the construction
of a state-of-the-art Moot Court-
room. Currently the Quad is
undergoing even more additions,
which include the Law School
Academic Building and Hutchins
Hall Law School Commons.
The purpose of the Academic.
Building is to house more class-
rooms, clinical work spaces,
multi-purpose rooms and offices
for the faculty and administrators
of the Law School. The Commons
is being built to accommodate
student study, interaction and
support rooms.
"It's designed to very clearly
express that it is within the col-
lection of buildings of the Law
School so that it will very intui-
tively speak to you as a continua-
tion of the quad," Gott said.
Whether thebuildings in ques-
tion were built back in 1925 or in
2011, their irrefutably unique
qualities - be they breathtaking
archways or modernized tech-
nology within the walls of the
magical structures - will contin-
ue to provide a muse for Univer-
sity students for years to come.

If spring didn't exist - some-
I times in Ann Arbor I think it
doesn't - poets would have had
to invent it. Breezes no longer
sting, but soothe, and daylight
lingers later
than we
remember
possible. We
are reminded
of the myriad
varieties of
green, and
the mineral DAVID
smell of rain LUCAS
and soil.
"What is
all this juice and all this joy?"
Gerard Manley Hopkins asks -
and though we know what it is
and trust it to arrive, spring nev-
ertheless surprises and overjoys
when it does.
Cycles of life and death con-
cern us all, of course, but poets
seem particularly obsessed. So
it's no surprise that they have
plenty to say about the most
symbolically resonant of all
seasons. In Philip Larkin's "The
Trees," buds have justbegun to
open. Larkin imagines the blos-
soming trees as
... unresting castles (which)
thresh '
In fullgrown thickness every
May.
Last year is dead, they seem to
say,
Begin afresh, afresh, afresh.
The richness of sound - espe-
cially the repeated "sh" in the
last line - recalls the rustle of
youngleaves, a music we may
have forgotten since last Novem-
ber. But the trees only seem to
say anything at all; we are the
ones who give voice to what we
see, smell and feel happening
around us.
And happening within us. The
season, Tony Hoagland reminds
us in "Just Spring," "drives more
(than) birds and flowers crazy."
And desire, "if you don't let it
out, everybody knows /backs
up and poisons you inside / like
old sap clogged inside a tree."
The Freudian teenagers in Hoa-
gland's poem vandalize church-
es "because they loved their
mothers so much / it was killing
them," and a recent divorcee
swears off love, even though she
secretly wants to be
... kissed all over her thirty-nine-
year old body
until, like Spring,
she comes and comes and comes.
Suffering Mother of God. Sweet
Jesus.
That's not to say it's all juice

and joy, though. If spring comes
with its melodies of love and
rejuvenation, such love and reju-
venation also remind us of all
that does not return, what is lost
for good.
T.S. Eliot opens "The Waste
Land" in springbut, lost in his
own spiritual desert, declares
that "April is the cruellest
month." Earthly reawakening
isn't much good to one whose
mind and heart remain wintry.
"To what purpose, April, do
you return again?" asks Edna
St. Vincent Millay in "Spring."
"Beauty is not enough." And it
never is, much as it astonishes
us for simply being. "It is not
enough that yearly, down this
hill, /April / Comes like an idiot,
babbling and strewing flowers."
April showers
bring.., poems.
Those of us who live in the
upper Midwest must beware
the false spring that lasts about
20 minutes before returning us
to a winter redux, colder than
ever. In "The Birds Return," the
Polish poet Wislawa Szymbo-
rska watches the birds "again
come back too early," and pro-
claims,
Rejoice, O reason, instinct can
also err.
It dozes off, it overlooks - and
down they fall into the snow,
and perish senselessly.
To watch this happen seems
unjust, even unnatural, to a
human sensibility. But Szym-
borska makes clear that this
is how new beginnings in fact
begin. Szymborska stakes a
clever, subtle claim on behalf
of those fallen birds, and false
spring, regarding the dropped
birds from the perspective of a
stone "which in its archaic and
boorish way / looks on all life as
attempts repeatedly failed."
The failures are necessary
and can even be beautiful
themselves. University English
Prof. Linda Gregerson writes
in "Spring Snow" of"a kind of
counter- / blossoming, diver-
sionary, // doomed." In this
spring blizzard, the old season
is not yet ready to be dethroned:
The saplings
made (who little thought
what beauty weighs) to bow
before their elders.

Accelerating this notion for-

validity of discussing architecture
instead of performing the prac-

to be "too theoretical" in the aca-

So the architecture students
are taking 20-minute power

laser cutter, and leaving the gym
behind, but for what result?
It seems that the students
have a variety of aspirations and
McMorrough is confident that
their education at the University
will support eclectic desires and
decisions.

"For the Bachelor of Science,
of course I think people join the
degree thinking they want to
be architects, but a lot of people
don't go on to be architects," he
said. "Not because they couldn't,
but because they discover other
things ... people have gone and
become filmmakers or painters or
lawyers or all sorts of things."
He is sure architectural edu-
cation is more about theory than
practice. The great reality about
that belief is that this unique way
of problem solving can translate
into a lot of different careers - it's
why the Architecture program
tries to describe the undergradu-
ate degree as liberal arts.
Though undergraduates are
afforded a more diverse future,
those who go to graduate school
and receive a Masters most likely
want to build - that is the expec-
tation.
The undergraduate students
can walk down varied avenues.
Junior Hannah Hunt Moeller
tends toward the humanitarian-
oriented direction. Alongside her
peers, Moeller started a group
called design FOR//HUMANS at
the University, using her skills to
help developing countries. The
group submitted two designs for
a playground competition for
Burmese refugee kids in Mae Sot,
Thailand. According to Moeller,
their small student-run organi-
zation serves as a think tank for
community design projects cen-
tered around human needs. It fits
what Moeller believes architects
see themselves as - "activists"
and "change-makers."
And in this light, the students in
the University's Architecture pro-
gram go beyond the making and
start to make change.
