Ford Policy Talk 
features panel 

on human rights, 
Middle East policy

By JOEL GOLDSTEIN

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ford School of Public Poli-

cy kicked off the semester of Ford 
Policy Talks with a panel discus-
sion on the refugee crisis in the 
Middle East, featuring journalist 
Luke Mogelson, NPR editor Joel 

Lovell, Public Policy Prof. John 
Ciorciari and Public Policy Prof. 
Susan Waltz.

Much of the talk featured 

Mogelson discussing his 2013 
New York Times Magazine arti-
cle, “The Dream Boat,” which 
examines his journey across the 
Indian Ocean with Middle East-
ern refugees in search of asylum 
in Australia.

For 
the 
article, 
Mogelson 

won the prestigious Livingston 
Award, which is sponsored by 
the University. Awarded to top 
journalists under 35 years old, 
the award’s previous recipients 

include 
CNN 
correspondent 

Christiane Amanpour and New 
York Times columnist Nicholas 
Kristof.

Working in Kabul, Afghani-

stan, for The New York Times 
Magazine, Mogelson embarked 
on the dangerous trip undertaken 
by Afghans trying to escape the 
country. He began his journey 
in Sarai Shahzada, Kabul’s cur-
rency market. Posing as Georgian 
asylum seekers, Mogelson and 
his photographer paid smugglers 
$4,000 each to transport them to 
Australia’s Christmas Island.

“The fact that your smug-

gler could call at any time, day 
or night, meant that you were 
forever suspended in a state of 
high alert,” Mogelson wrote in 
the article. “It also meant you 
couldn’t venture far. Most of the 
asylum seekers, additionally fear-
ful of police, never left the build-
ing.”

Like refugees, the journal-

ists flew to Indonesia and took a 
small boat from Jakarta, Indo-
nesia, to Australia. In the arti-
cle, Mogelson explains that a 
refugee could wait for months 
in Jakarta, drown in the open 

Schlissel announces 
campus-wide study 

on ‘U’ culture, 

misconduct policies

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

University President Mark 

Schlissel announced early Mon-
day morning the University’s 
plans to conduct a student sur-
vey gauging the climate sur-
rounding sexual misconduct on 
campus.

In an e-mail distributed to 

the student body, Schlissel said 
3,000 randomly selected stu-
dents will receive the roughly 
15-minute long survey asking 
about their knowledge, percep-
tions and opinions of the Uni-
versity’s resources, policies and 
culture related to sexual mis-
conduct.

“Learning about the expe-

riences of students and the 
degree to which students feel 
safe and respected will help us 

better understand how we can 
more effectively address and 
prevent sexual misconduct,” 
Schlissel wrote.

Though the survey data will 

be made public, student identi-
ties will remain confidential. 
The University will offer par-
ticipating students the choice 
of either personal payment or a 
donation to United Way, a sup-
port group that promotes edu-
cation, financial stability and 
good health for Washtenaw 
County citizens, as compensa-
tion for completing the survey.

The University has hired 

Ann Arbor firm Survey Science 
Group to conduct the survey.

University 
spokesperson 

Rick Fitzgerald said the Univer-
sity has worked on the survey 
for some time based on a recom-
mendation from a White House 
task force designed to combat 
sexual misconduct on college 
campuses nationwide.

“We hope the survey will 

give us an initial information on 
what students understand about 
the policy, what services are

SACUA meets for their weekly meeting Monday in the Regents Room at the Fleming Administration Building.

IT officials update 

faculty body on 

changes to University 

guidelines

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

The Senate Advisory Com-

mittee on University Affairs 
convened 
in 
the 
Fleming 

Administration Building Mon-
day to discuss potential updates 
to University Information Tech-
nology Policy.

Alan Levy, IT policy and com-

pliance lead for the University, 
and Sol Bermann, the Univer-
sity’s interim chief information 
security officer, joined the com-
mittee to review IT-related 

revisions to the University’s 
Standard Practice Guide, the 
document which includes Uni-
versity-wide policies regarding 
specific standards and expecta-
tions for University employees.

Levy introduced updates to 

three policies that applied spe-
cifically to SACUA and have not 
been revised since their initial 
implementation, including the 
Proper Use Policy, an umbrella 
IT policy written for University 
employees to abide by in 1990.

Proposal use policies are 

intended to stipulate the ways in 
which networks or websites are 
used.

The second program, a sub-

set of the Proper Use Policy, was 
written in the mid-1990s and 
has also never received revi-
sion. Levy said the IT depart-

ment wishes to add a paragraph 
to clarify that the program will 
apply to students.

“We want to represent the 

culture and ethos of this insti-
tution,” Levy said. “We have 
written drafts that we hope and 
believe are the U-M way of doing 
things.”

The third proposal was to 

implement a new software-
licensing standard to replace the 
previous versions, which were 
developed in 1979 and 1993.

“We have not done a good job 

with keeping up with what is 
going on in the software world,” 
Levy said.

SACUA also discussed the 

election process for LSA’s exec-
utive committee, which includes 
several 
faculty 
members

Students sell 

apparel following 
appointment of 

new football coach 

By LINDSEY SCULLEN

Daily Staff Reporter

Since 
the 
departure 
of 

Brady Hoke, former Michigan 
football coach, LSA juniors 
Zachary Bruch and Ryan Luck 
have been eager to welcome 
Michigan coach Jim Har-
baugh to Ann Arbor — or as 
they call it, “Ann Arbaugh.”

Bruch and Luck filed to 

trademark the phrase “Ann 
Arbaugh” on the day of the 
press conference announcing 
Harbaugh’s arrival Dec. 30. 
They started selling affiliated 
products the day before.

“Before the press confer-

ence, we went ahead and 
decided to file for the trade-
mark. We kind of just took the 
risk,” Luck said.

With the help of Luck’s 

friend Benjamin Frost, owner 
of Frostees Apparel, a Talla-
hassee-based screen-printing 
T-shirt company, Luck and 
Bruch designed apparel, most 
of which reads “Ann Arbaugh” 
across the front.

“We 
wanted 
that 
‘Ann 

Arbaugh’ name on the chest,” 
Luck said. “Everyone’s been 
proud to rep that.”

Bruch and Luck now sell a 

variety of products through

Funding plan could 

impact higher 

education funding 

allocations

By JACK TURMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Republican Gov. Rick Sny-

der signed legislation Monday 
afternoon to advance a plan for 
funding upgrades to Michigan’s 
aging roads and bridges.

The plan will remove the 

current sales tax on fuel, which 
currently supports schools and 
local governments, and replace 
it with a wholesale tax on motor 
fuels, such as gas and diesel, ear-
marked for funding transporta-
tion.

The plan is expected to result 

in a 20-percent drop in yearly 
appropriations from the School 
Aid Fund to public universities, 
though the legislation includes 
provisions to offset the losses 
with General Fund dollars.

To protect schools and local 

governments from losing rev-
enue as a result of these altera-
tions to the fuel sales tax, a 
proposal will go before the 
electorate in May that includes 
a 1-percent increase in the sales 
tax to 7 percent. The result from 
this 1-percent increase would be 
an additional $300 million per 
year for schools and $94 million 
per year for local governments.

The legislature would raise 

approximately $1.3 billion per 
year for transportation. Approx-
imately $1.2 billion would go 

to restoring the roads and $127 
million would be allocated for 
public transportation after two 
years of debt reduction.

“This is a solution that takes 

care of our roads in terms of a bil-
lion dollar plus investment, does 
it in a way that does not harm 
other parties,” Snyder said. “In 
fact, it actually provides more 
resources for our schools, for our 
local governments, for our mass 
transit, mass public transporta-
tion.”

Gretchen Whitmer, former 

State Senate Democratic leader, 
said there were tough negotia-
tions in determining the legisla-
tive package, but she noted she 
was proud of being a part of this 
process.

“This represents an invest-

ment in critical things, like our 
infrastructure, our roads, our 
bridges, which translates into 
the safety of our people, but it 
also represents a real investment 
in our schools, which I think is 
something that is going to be 
critical as we go to the ballot in 
May. That is something I think 
we are all invested in making 
sure we’re successful,” she said.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily on Dec. 18, Sny-
der Press Secretary Sara Wurfel 
confirmed that if the proposal is 
approved, General Fund dollars 
will be allocated to substitute 
higher education funding no 
longer provided by the School 
Aid Fund, though it is unclear if 
this funding will fully make up 
for anticipated losses.

PROF. TARFIA FAIZULLAH

Poet chronicles year abroad

RITA MORRIS/Daily

LSA Freshman Cryserica Jeter practices her 
choreography for The Movements Dance Team in 
Angel Hall Monday evening. 

ON STAGE

Tarfia Faizullah is the Delbanco 
Visiting Professor of Creative 
Writing. In addition to being pub-
lished in the American Poetry 
Review, Oxford American and the 
New England Review, she won 
the Pushcart Prize and the Crab 
Orchard Series in Poetry First 
Book Award for “Seam,” her book 
on living in Bangladesh for a year 
on a Fulbright Scholarship. 

How did you start writing?

I was a really shy, awkward child 
and I felt like both reading and 
writing opened up a world of 
wonder for me. It also sort of gave 
me something that I could con-
trol, which I thought was really 
powerful at the time. When 

you’re a kid, you think the world 
tends to happen to you or hap-
pen all around you. Being able to 
close and open a book or being 
able to write something that was 
free of any judgment was really 
profound for me. So I was pretty 
young when I started writing 
and I never really stopped.

What is your book “Seam” 

about?

It’s a book of poetry. In 2010 I 
went to Bangladesh for a year 
on a Fulbright Scholarship and 
I researched the 1971 liberation 
war in which Bangladesh won 
its independence from Pakistan 
and I was in Bangladesh to spe-
cifically research and interview 

Bangladeshi women who were 
raped or taken as sex slaves dur-
ing that same war. The book 
chronicles that year abroad and 
the experience I had there as 
well as the interviews. There 
are also a number of poems that 
are written from the perspective 
from one of these women, who 
were raped during the war.

What is the last piece you 

wrote?

I wrote a poem recently that’s 
called “While it’s Still Safe.” I 
just wrote that a couple of weeks 
ago. I’m not entirely sure what 
it’s about.

Police report 

violence committed 
against ex-girlfriend 

(AP) — George Zimmerman 

became angry and threw a wine 
bottle at his ex-girlfriend when 
she tried to break up with him, 
according to a police report 
released Monday.

Zimmerman denied throw-

ing the bottle and disputed her 
claim that he destroyed her cell 
phone last week, according to 
the report, which chronicles his 
latest run-in with police since 
he was acquitted of murdering 
Trayvon Martin in 2013. The 
killing of the unarmed black teen 
touched off protests across the 
country.

Instead, Zimmerman said, he 

was only trying to prevent her 
from entering his home.

The 
former 
neighborhood 

watch volunteer was arrested 

Friday in Lake Mary and charged 
with aggravated assault. He was 
released Saturday on $5,000 bond.

Zimmerman didn’t respond 

to a message left on his cell 
phone Monday by The Associ-
ated Press.

Officers patrolling the neigh-

borhood 
where 
Zimmerman 

lives last week heard the sound 
of glass shattering, and then 
saw the former girlfriend drive 
out of the driveway. They pulled 
her over for a traffic stop a few 
streets over because she didn’t 
have her lights on.

She explained that Zimmer-

man became angry after she told 
him she didn’t want to take the 
relationship further, and they 
also argued over a painting she 
had that he wanted returned. 
Zimmerman made threats and 
threw the wine bottle, which 
didn’t hit her, she said.

Detectives 
described 
her 

as “extremely emotional, cry-
ing, mad and upset” and said 

she became reluctant to coop-
erate when she realized that 
officers might be conducting 
an investigation. She called her 
former boyfriend “that psycho, 
George Zimmerman” and said 
several times that she should 
have known better than to get 
involved with him.

The ex-girlfriend, whose name 

is redacted, told investigators 
that she had had an “intimate 
relationship” with Zimmerman 
since the end of last year.

“She indicated that this began 

at a time when she was emotion-
ally vulnerable,” the report said.

Zimmerman was arrested at 

his house on Friday, four days 
after the confrontation. Detec-
tives said in the police report 
that he refused to come to the 
door for more than two hours 
despite their repeated knocking. 
They said they could hear the 
television on and a dog barking.

Zimmerman eventually came 

outside after police officers 
agreed to allow him to keep his 
attorney on his cell phone with 
him while he was interviewed, 
the report said.

Zimmerman was acquitted in 

2013 of a second-degree murder 
charge for shooting Martin in 
a gated community in Sanford, 
Florida.

In resort towns, 
working class 

squeezed out amid 
growing wealth gap

(AP) — At first, Loly Garcia 

didn’t have to travel far to her 
jobs in the chic hotels of this 
fabled tourist town. She shared 
a tiny studio apartment with 
her father, brother and a cousin 
after arriving from El Salvador 

more than 20 years ago. 

But after she married and 

wanted a home of her own, she 
had to drive 23 miles west, past 
tracts of empty land and vacant 
mansions whose owners visit 
only a couple of weeks a year, to 
the mobile home park where she 
now lives.

The drive eventually wore 

her down, and she decided to 
take lower-paying work closer 
to home. “That commute — it 
becomes 10 hours a week. It’s 
like working an extra day,” said 
Garcia, 49. “It’s hard to live 
here.”

Resort towns like Aspen 

dramatically demonstrate an 
unnerving trend: Across the 
country, the rich are getting 
richer while the rest of the 
country is essentially treading 
water. 

From 
2009 
to 
2012, 

inflation-adjusted 
income 

for the wealthiest 1 percent 
of 
U.S. 
households 
surged 

31 
percent, 
according 
to 

economist Emmanuel Saez of 
the University of California, 
Berkeley. For everyone else, 
income inched up just 0.4 
percent.

In Aspen, the division is 

especially stark because it 
goes beyond mere money. The 
wealth gap is also a geographic 
divide.

The people who clean the 

vacation homes, maintain the 
mansions’ gardens and work 
in the hotels must find housing 
in 
mobile 
home 
parks 
or 

subdivisions squeezed into the 
few acres of developable space 
dozens of miles to the west. 
A lucky few — about half of 
Aspen’s year-round population 
of 6,700 — are able to score 
units in the town’s unusual 
affordable housing program 
that, on the open market, would 
sell for millions of dollars.

Meanwhile, residents who 

struggle to find affordable real 
estate 
watch 
an 
increasing 

number of houses in town 
become 
rarely 
inhabited 

vacation properties.

“It’s a mirror image of Detroit, 

where wealth, not poverty, is 
driving population down,” said 
Mick Ireland, a former three-
term Aspen mayor.

Aspen’s dilemma is similar to 

that of other resort towns, from 
Nantucket, Massachusetts, to 
Park City, Utah, especially those 
nestled in the jagged terrain of 
the western United States. 

In the West, vast tracts 

of 
public 
land 
and 
sheer 

mountain faces prevent the 
easy development of suburbs to 
house workers, pushing clusters 
of more affordable housing 
many miles away. 


DETROIT
Detroit house fire 
kills woman and 
her adult daughter

Authorities say an electrical 

problem may have caused a fire 
at a home on Detroit’s east side 
that killed a 57-year-old woman 
and her 32-year-old daughter.

Fire officials are investigating 

Monday morning’s blaze on 
Wilfred 
Street. 
The 
Detroit 

News 
identifies 
the 
victims 

as Hattie Simmons and her 
daughter, Tonquinia Simmons.

Charles Harris tells WJBK-

TV that he yelled for his family 
to follow him out of the burning 
house after his daughter ran 
down the stairs yelling “There’s 
a fire! There’s a fire!”

Harris says he tried to go 

back into the house when he 
saw no one behind him, but the 
intense smoke stopped him at 
the kitchen door.

WXYZ-TV says an electrical 

problem may have caused the 
fire.

NEW YORK
U.S. stocks decline 
with energy sector 
as oil prices fall

Energy companies are leading 

a decline on the stock market as 
crude oil continues to tumble.

The price of oil dropped 

another 5 percent Monday to 
$46 a barrel. That’s far below its 
recent peak of more than $100 
a barrel last June. The slump 
means much lower profits for

JACKSON, Miss.
Congressman 
takes oath during 
hospital stay

A Mississippi congressman 

who’s recovering from a series 
of health problems has taken his 
oath of office while hospitalized 
in his hometown.

Republican Rep. Alan Nun-

nelee was sworn in Monday 
by U.S. District Judge Michael 
Mills at North Mississippi Medi-
cal Center in Tupelo.

Nunnelee had a stroke while 

surgeons were removing a tumor 
from his brain in June. The 
56-year-old was admitted to the 
Tupelo hospital Dec. 28 for treat-
ment of a hematoma, a bleeding 
problem in his left leg.

Uganda’s 
government 
said 

Monday it wants to try the 
Lord’s Resistance Army rebel 
commander who recently sur-
rendered to U.S. forces for 
war crimes and crimes against 
humanity.

Dominic Ongwen is in U.S. 

custody 
in 
Central 
African 

Republic 
after 
surrendering 

there on Jan. 6. He is wanted 
by the International Criminal 
Court in The Hague, Nether-
lands.

“Some of our partners want 

him tried by the ICC but we want 
him tried in Uganda because we 
have the capacity to try him,” 
said Uganda State Minister for 
Regional Cooperation Asuman 
Kiyingi.

Kiyingi 
said 
a 
decision 

would be made during consul-
tations between the African 
Union, Uganda, U.S. and United 
Nations.

“The biggest problem is 

that LSA faculty are under the

said. “The dean is most like-

The process of electing board

com, including three different 
short-sleeved T-shirts, three 
long-sleeved T-shirts and three 
sweatshirts. The short-sleeved 
shirts go for $15 each; the long-
sleeved shirts cost $22; the 
sweatshirts are $30.

In addition to the “Ann 

Arbaugh” prints, they also have 
variations that read “The Kha-
kis, The Khakis, The Khakis” 
in honor of storied coach Bo 
Schembechler’s mantra, “The 
team, the team, the team,” and 
Harbaugh’s well-known prefer-
ence for khaki pants.

LSA freshman Rachel Steir 

was the first “Ann Arbaugh” 
customer. She discovered the 
product in Bruch and Luck’s 
post in the Facebook group 
“University of Michigan Class 
of 2018”.

“I was really impressed; I 

thought it was really creative,” 
she said. “My whole family 
has ordered the shirts; we love 
them.”

The orders, however, are not 

only coming from Michigan 
students, Luck said. They’re 
coming from Kentucky, Texas, 
Kansas, California and all over 
the United States.

As their business grows, 

Bruch and Luck say they are 
unsure what to expect next, 
especially as the process hap-
pened very quickly and their 
trademark application has yet 
to be approved.

Stephanie Wydick, an assis-

tant of social media for the 
Detroit Red Wings, also filed 
to trademark “Ann Arbaugh” 
on Dec. 30 — the same day as 
Bruch and Luck.

Her 
request 
appears 
to 

have arrived hours after the 
one made by Bruch and Luck, 

according to the United States 
Patent and Trademark Office 
website.

Wydick’s 
application 
was 

filed on an intent-to-use basis, 
meaning she would plan to use 
the slogan if approved; whereas 
Bruch and Luck’s filing was on 
an actual-use basis, meaning 
they had already begun selling 
their product before applying 
for trademark.

According to Chris Falkows-

ki, an intellectual property 
attorney 
based 
in 
Detroit, 

actual use applications are in a 
stronger position than intent-
to-use applications.

Falkowski added that there 

could be a few hurdles as far as 
attaining a trademark for “Ann 
Arbaugh.”

The first is that Ann Arbor 

is a geographic location — one 
that cannot be trademarked. 
While “Ann Arbaugh” is not 
directly a geographic location, 
it could potentially raise some 
issues. The second is that Har-
baugh himself has the right of 
publicity to his name and he 
could potentially claim that 
right.

Bruch and Luck, however, 

are not concerned.

“We’ve been talking about 

this idea forever,” Bruch said. 
“We’ve known that this is our 
idea, our content, our intellec-
tual property.”

The pair expects to hear 

about 
the 
trademark 
rul-

ing within the next couple 
of weeks. In the meantime, 
they’re enjoying the process.

“It’s been great, it’s a great 

opportunity — and Harbaugh, 
Harbaugh’s going to be here 
for a while,” Luck said. “It’s 
going to be the Harbaugh era 
… there’s this whole new buzz 
and excitement at the school. 
We’re really glad to be a part 
of it.”

water or be turned around by 
officials along the way. Mogelson 
noted that almost all of the refu-
gees he encountered, including a 
pregnant woman, were diverted 
to detention centers in Papua 
New Guinea and the Republic of 
Nauru.

“The most common word they 

used to describe their lives back 
home was ‘na-aomid’ – hopeless,” 
Mogelson wrote.

Most refugees were either 

unaware or indifferent to Aus-
tralian laws that instruct officials 
to move refugees away from the 
country. Mogelson’s boat carried 
57 mostly Iranian refugees for 
three days before being divert-
ed to one of the smaller island 
nations.

According to Mogelson, the 

refugees he traveled with prob-
ably will not reach Australia, or 
any other developed country.

“They manage to convince 

themselves that there’s hope, 
when there’s not,” Mogelson said.

After recounting the story, 

Mogelson and the panel dis-
cussed 
the 
current 
refugee 

problem. Ciorciari, a professor 
of public policy, explained that 
while people fleeing war and nat-
ural disaster are popularly called 
refugees, legally, one can only be 
considered a refugee if they are 
specifically targeted.

Ciorciari said this presents 

problems for people displaced 
by calamity, but are not legally 
protected in the same way as 
political opponents and victims 
of genocide.

Waltz said people are either 

displaced 
within 
their 
own 

country, forced to travel to a 
neighboring country or interna-
tionally to avoid danger.

Waltz said each state is largely 

free to set up its own protocols 
for dealing with refugees and 
displaced people.

“Because the world commu-

nity was not ready to set up a 
central mechanism, it left to indi-
vidual states ways to grant people 
political asylum to whoever they 
wanted to grant it to,” she said.

While each state scrambles to 

deal with asylum seekers, there 
are more displaced people now 
than there have been in recent 
history. According to the Unit-
ed Nations, there are now 51.2 
million people who are forcibly 
displaced, more than there have 
been since the end of World War 
II. Internationally, states have 
pledged to resettle about 1 per-
cent of these people.

Monday, David Murray, Sny-
der’s deputy press secretary, 
said the governor has been 
a 
proponent 
of 
prioritiz-

ing “P-20” education, which 
includes elementary through 
higher education.

“We know that a rock-solid 

education is essential to build 
a talented workforce in Michi-
gan that will attract and retain 
businesses and grow more and 
better jobs for the state’s resi-
dents,” Murray said.

Murray also noted Snyder is 

a supporter of increasing dual 

enrollment 
opportunities 
for 

high school students and the cost 
of higher education, which he 
outlined in the fiscal 2015 budget.

“The fiscal 2015 budget, 

which went into effect in 
October, includes a 3-percent 
increase in operations funding 
for community colleges and a 
5.9-percent increase for state 
universities,” he said. “Univer-
sities were required to limit 
tuition increases to 3.2 percent 
or less in order to receive their 
funding increase.”

Murray added that Snyder’s 

State of the State address, 
which is next week, will pre-
view additional recommenda-
tions for the upcoming fiscal 
year.

available, perhaps give us better 
data on the incidence of sexual 
misconduct,” he said. “All of 
that would be the kinds of addi-
tional feedback that’s unique 
to our campus and would help 
inform any further changes in 
additional resources.”

Fitzgerald said he expects 

an analysis of survey results be 
released this summer.

The University will also 

participate in another student-
wide survey on sexual mis-
conduct administered by the 
Association of American Uni-
versities, a non-profit organiza-
tion comprised of 62 research 
universities, according to a 
news release.

In November, the University 

released its first report soley 
focused on sexual misconduct. 
The report listed the Univer-
sity’s response to 129 reported 
instances of assault. The alle-
gations increased by 46 reports 
in 2014 compared to 2013.

Following the release of the 

report, Schlissel said campus 
climate 
surrounding 
sexual 

misconduct is a top priority as 
administrators are working on 
ways to study and reduce the 
number of reported and occur-
rences of sexual misconduct.

“This is an issue we’re going 

to have to keep working on 
until the number is zero,” 
Schlissel said in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily in 
December.

Many students have voiced 

their concerns on how the Uni-
versity handles sexual miscon-
duct on campus last semester.

Survivors and allies of sex-

ual assault and misconduct 
protested across the Univer-
sity in October in part of a 
national “Carry That Weight” 
campaign. 
The 
organizers 

also announced a list of seven 
demands for University offi-
cials to address sexual assault 
on campus.

In Septmeber, the Office of 

Student Conflict Resolution 
also hired a sexual misconduct 
program manager to further 
address the issue.

T

welve years ago, “student 
ghetto” meant Greenwood 
Avenue 
— 
the 
one-way 

street 
home 
to 

hanging sneakers 
and the Ann Arbor 
Police 
Depart-

ment’s 
favorite 

block party. Even 
former 
Mayor 

John 
Hieftje 

agreed with the 
label, telling the 
Daily 
in 
2003, 

“That’s what it’s 
called, 
and 
it’s 

part of being in a 
university town.”

More than a decade later, Hief-

tje still sees symptoms of a student 
ghetto at Greenwood, but recently 
shifting real estate trends could 
change this. What were previously 
student neighborhoods, Hieftje told 
me, are beginning to see families 
and non-students move in. In Ann 
Arbor, the term “student ghetto” 
may only last as long it takes to build 
a luxury high rise.

In the last decade, the area sur-

rounding Central Campus has seen 
a development boom, as lofts like 
Zaragon, Landmark and Varsity 
have elbowed their way into the Ann 
Arbor skyline. Ann Arbor Blu, cur-
rently a hole in the ground next to 
Pizza House, should be finished and 
open for business in the fall of 2015. 
Given the increasingly wealthy 
makeup of Michigan’s student body, 
it’s hard to see the number of lofts 
staying stagnant for long, especially 
as the University continues to reno-
vate dorms potentially, creating 
short-term housing shortages.

Many residents of Ann Arbor, 

including less wealthy students, 
supported the development of these 
monstrous 
apartment 
buildings, 

largely in the hopes of lowering rent 
costs. For non-student residents, 
this hope may soon be realized.

As wealthier students move into 

high rises, landlords owning mod-
erately expensive housing shift 

their focus from the remaining stu-
dent renters (who would require 
reduced prices) to new families or 
young professionals. These non-stu-
dents can afford rent close to cam-
pus, which is lower than a house 
or an apartment near Main Street. 
As these neighborhoods become 
increasingly non-student, value-
lowering factors like trash, noise 
and poor maintenance will peter 
out, raising overall prices.

For now, low-income students 

can still afford a limited amount 
of housing near campus, often by 
splitting rooms, packing houses, or 
accepting shoddy living conditions. 
If the above prediction plays out, it 
will limit options for low-income 
students even more, pushing them 
as far away from campus as Ypsi-
lanti (from where some low-income 
and otherwise frugal University 
students are already commuting).

In the big picture, these trends 

are troubling for several reasons. 
One issue that has already begun to 
play out is greater campus segrega-
tion and polarization. For poorer 
students, this means living only 
near other low-income students 
while being forced to commute to 
campus by car or bus. Conversely, 
lofts like Landmark concentrate 
large numbers of wealthy students 
all in one place, while their close 
proximity to campus means that 
residents rarely leave their comfort 
zone for much of anything.

This residential polarization also 

has snowball-like political conse-
quences. According to Ann Arbor’s 
City Charter, City Council wards 
are to be drawn like slices of a pie, 
with the pieces converging near the 
center of the city, i.e., the center of 
campus. This layout divides the stu-
dent vote across each ward, mean-
ing no single district is likely to elect 
a student or a candidate focused on 
student issues. With heavier con-
centration in the city center, this 
problem may only become worse.

Rather than a diabolical ger-

rymandering scheme (my original 

theory), Kestenbaum believes the 
city wanted to avoid creating one 
ward with only a few likely voters. 
According to Kestenbaum, who is 
also an attorney and history blog-
ger, the layout of the city wards 
was decided before the voting age 
was reduced to 18, meaning most 
students couldn’t vote anyway. The 
fear, Kestenbaum explained, is of 
a ward with so little voting activ-
ity that its elections could be easily 
manipulated.

Given the current boundaries of 

City Council wards, the student vote 
is set up to be watered down for any 
City Council election. If wealthy 
students continue to crowd even 
closer around the center of the city 
while poorer students are forced 
into the outskirts or out of the city 
completely, the student voice may 
suffer even more, especially for 
those who need it the most. And as 
student voices dissipate, city gov-
ernment will have fewer and fewer 
incentives to craft policy favorable 
to both students and non-students.

Many of the necessary pieces for 

the above scenario are already in 
place. For future low-income stu-
dents, their time on campus does 
not look particularly promising 
— and let’s not forget that the only 
important City Council elections in 
Ann Arbor, the Democratic prima-
ries, are held in August, when most 
students are gone.

However, there is one glimmer of 

hope: general elections, which are 
held in November, include ballot 
proposals. Hieftje noted that many 
candidates won office running on 
hugely popular issues in the 1970s 
thanks to students. What kind of 
issues galvanized the student vote 
forty years ago? According to Hief-
tje, it was decriminalizing marijua-
na possession to a $5 (now $25) fine.

The student ghetto may soon be a 

thing of the past, but in Ann Arbor, 
some things may never change.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

I

t was a new semester. New 
professors and new classmates 
and new subjects and greater 

enlightenment 
waited 
ahead. 

I filed into my 
500-person 
lec-

ture early, eager 
to 
make 
new 

friends as the term 
started anew, and 
anxious to pro-
ceed through the 
course with a new 
study buddy.

Luckily, 
a 

plain-looking guy 
plopped this bags next to mine, and 
we easily struck up a conversation. 
He was amiable, eloquent in speech 
and seemingly open-minded. We 
were all Michigan liberals in a Race 
and Ethnicity requirement class that 
heightened a sense of progressivism 
inside us all.

He started by asking about the 

classes I was taking — standard. 
I was taking blah, blah, blah and 
Working Women’s Class Literature 
— the one class that stuck out to him.

“Oh, so you’re a feminist,” he sud-

denly chuckled — scoffed.

Confused, I rebutted with waver-

ing confidence, “Yeah … Yes. I am.”

I probed further. “Is that bad?” 
 

I asked.

“Well, I guess not. But you’re 

a feminist. You’re one of those,” 
he answered, as if the title was 
 

a disease.

Reflecting 
in 
retrospect, 
he 

turned what is, at the core, sim-
ply the support of gender equality 
into a pejorative concept that the 
media often portrays negatively. 
His understanding of feminism 
was based on the rants of Tumblr 
extremists, the angry Facebook 
posts of his “feminist friends” 
and radical perspectives brought 
to light by the news. Feminism to 
him only had one degree: extreme. 
It equated to a hatred of men and 
a disavowal of anyone who dis-
agreed. Feminism has now become 
a concept people love to hate — an 
idea stigmatized by people’s igno-
rance on the subject.

As shocked as I was by his lack 

of understanding, I realize that as 

a feminist, labeling or condemning 
people for being “dumb” or despi-
cable is neither a solution to the 
problem nor a way to demonstrate 
my support for feminism. That day 
in lecture, I could have berated him 
for his gross misconceptions, and 
then indoctrinated him with what 
I believe to be correct. However, I 
most likely wouldn’t have inspired 
him to change his outlook by belit-
tling his intelligence. In his eyes, I 
probably would’ve exemplified the 
exact social-media radical feminist 
that he envisions.

Rather, it is important to under-

stand that some people are simply 
misled about the subject of feminism. 
Thus, where better to implement 
this education than in college? It is 
becoming increasingly necessary for 
universities — namely, Michigan — 
 

to have a gender studies requirement 
as part of the core distribution.

Historically, racial progress has 

typically come before progress of 
gender equality. Most prominently, 
African-American men were ini-
tially granted the right to vote in 
1865, about 55 years before the 19th 
Amendment was ratified. This is not 
to overshadow the significance of 
any civil rights advancement. How-
ever, in similar fashion to the prec-
edent history has set, it seems like 
an appropriate progression to extend 
the University’s Race and Ethnic-
ity requirement to a Gender Studies 
course as well.

The University currently requires 

every student to take at least one 
Race and Ethnicity course for a min-
imum of three credits. As the LSA 
page explains, an approved Race 
and Ethnicity requirement discusses 
“the meaning of race, ethnicity, and 
racism; racial and ethnic intolerance 
and resulting inequality as it occurs 
in the United States or elsewhere; 
(and) comparisons of discrimination 
based on race, ethnicity, religion, 
social class, or gender.”

Even though the University’s 

Curriculum Committee requires 
courses to be re-certified as a Race 
and Ethnicity requirement every 
five years, there is a reason these 
courses are labeled as they are, 
where discussion of gender study 
is limited. Though many Race and 

Ethnicity requirement classes do 
sometimes address feminism, stu-
dents can only be provided with a 
fractional understanding — super-
ficially 
glazing 
over 
women’s 
 

rights 
and 
skimming 
over 
 

transgender issues.

Just as with accepting racial and 

ethnic equality, gender equality 
is not — or should not be — a revo-
lutionary concept. Especially at a 
college that prides itself on its diver-
sity, we must reflect that through 
our academic courses. As students, 
we learn about the oppression, the 
history and the gradual improve-
ment of different cultures in our 
country. Yet we often overlook the 
struggles of half of our population. 
Essentially, discrimination to differ-
ent ethnicities feels different from 
oppression of different sexes. Every 
identity feels social struggle and 
social advancement differently.

Our society is becoming increas-

ingly aware of feminist issues, 
especially with recent campaigns 
promoting female equality, such 
as the United Nations He for She 
and the White House’s It’s On Us 
this past September. We are college 
students with malleable mindsets 
before the real world hardens us; 
we are young adults at the peak of 
fighting for what we are passionate 
about. It is the prime opportunity to 
teach us about injustices, inequali-
ties — or simply, diversity — in the 
world so we have the opportunity to 
ameliorate them in our lifetime.

Even as students at a reputable 

college such as Michigan, there is 
still so much we do not understand. 
We represent some of the “leaders 
and best” in the nation, yet not all 
of us are equipped with a complete 
understanding of all facets of the 
society we will soon lead.

We are all uneducated about our 

own respective topics. We can’t all 
be radical feminists who will lead 
to the reform of the entire system 
of societal thinking. But we can at 
least equip students with the litera-
ture and tools to develop their own 
opinions, which hopefully will be for 
greater equality in our society.

Improving the pre-med curriculum 

The University offers over 75 majors and 

over 100 minors — and that’s just in its Col-
lege of Literature, Sciences, and the Arts. 
Ranging from majors in English and micro-
biology to minors in oceanography and eco-
nomics, the University has everything. Well, 
almost everything. While 40 LSA programs 
rank among the top 10 in their field, the Uni-
versity lacks a degree program that caters 
to its future doctors. Instead, the University 
encourages its future doctors to acquire a 
balanced and challenging liberal arts educa-
tion. The liberal arts education that lies at 
the core of the University’s LSA graduation 
requirements includes courses focused in the 
humanities, race and ethnicity, and quantita-
tive reasoning.

Students who aspire to become doctors 

must take courses toward a major, courses 
toward the distribution requirements and the 
medical school prerequisite courses. Many 
of the classes required to apply to medical 
school, such as introductory science courses, 
count merely as prerequisites toward LSA 
degree programs.

Being in LSA is awesome; I get to major 

in Spanish, while also completing minors in 
biochemistry and business through the Ste-
phen M. Ross School of Business. While I love 
the diversity of my education, the breadth of 
knowledge comes with vast requirements, 
forcing many premedical students to take 
courses during spring and/or summer terms. 
To better serve its pre-medical students, 
while also maintaining its integrity as a com-
prehensive liberal arts education, LSA should 
create a program designed for pre-medical 
students. Ideally, this program would allow 

the required courses needed to apply to medi-
cal school to count toward a degree. In this 
fashion, pre-medical students would be able 
to both learn everything they need to know 
to apply to medical school and take advantage 
of the wide variety of programs ranked so 
highly. Just as being a doctor requires more 
than just medical and scientific knowledge, 
so should being a pre-medical student. A 
well-rounded education would produce doc-
tors who are better able to connect with and 
holistically treat patients.

The course requirements for applying to 

medical school continue to increase for class-
es applying after 2016. New requirements, 
which are also tested on the new Medical Col-
lege Admission Test beginning in April 2015, 
include sociology, psychology and biochemis-
try, an extra 11 to 12 credits designed to cre-
ate future doctors with broad knowledge. The 
American Association of Medical Colleges, the 
governing body of medical schools and admis-
sion, has also created a list of 15 core compe-
tencies to evaluate potential doctors. Among 
these competencies are scientific inquiry, 
teamwork and social skills. As the landscape 
changes regarding what courses and experi-
ences medical school admissions committees 
desire and expect, so too should the under-
graduate education of the future doctors.

Pre-medical students at the University of 

Michigan look like elementary students con-
torting their bodies while playing a game 
of Twister. At times, the balancing act is 
impressive. At other times, students collapse 
to the floor.

he Michigan Department of Education announced on 
Jan. 7 that starting in spring 2016, the state will require 
high school juniors to take the SAT instead of the ACT, 

the state’s college-entrance test of choice since 2007. The College 
Board, a nonprofit organization that administers the SAT, and 
ACT, Inc. engaged in a competitive bidding process to decide 
which test would be administered to students. The College Board’s 
bid of $17.1 million over the course of three years was chosen 
over the ACT’s $32.5-million bid. While the shift could prove to 
be beneficial in saving the state money and creating uniformity 
throughout the education system, the suddenness of the change 
raises questions about the MDE’s motivations and potentially 
adverse effects.

According to the College Board, more than 

3.6 million students take the PSAT, the SAT 
preparatory exam, each year. Therefore, 
high schools administering the SAT ensure 
consistency of students’ learning trajectories. 
Most prominently, the change saves the 
state money, potentially allowing for more 
investment in resources — including teachers 
and curriculums — to continue to prepare 
students for the SAT. Similarly, Michigan 
high schools will retain one important aspect 
of the old system: the ACT’s WorkKeys 
exam, which holds a $12.2 million three-
year contract. The exams tests general job 
skills for all high school juniors, including 
assessments in applied mathematics, locating 
information and reading for information. 

According to University spokesperson Rick 

Fitzgerald, “the University has accepted both 
tests for many years, so this will not have a 
significant change.” While this change may 
not affect University applicants directly, 
several challenges could present themselves 
to high school students during the transition 
process between tests. Michigan’s short, 
three-year contract with the SAT could create 
future difficulties, as there’s no guarantee 
the state will not switch back to the ACT or 
another exam. These switches have potential 
detrimental effects for both schools’ and 
students’ test preparation prior to the exam.

The switch from the ACT to the SAT also 

presents challenges for long-term educational 
data collection in Michigan. It will be difficult 
to compare SAT exam scores, as the state 
collected data on the ACT for eight years. The 

decision was seemingly made for monetary 
reasons, without much input from students 
and educators. “They just pulled the rug out 
from under us, with absolutely no warning,” 
Michael Boulus, Executive Director of 
the Presidents Council, State Universities 
of Michigan, told the Detroit Free Press. 
“It’s very clear from the news release that 
this was done purely out of cost savings, 
with little concern for the students and the 
 

admissions 
process 
we’ve 
been 
using 

for years.”

Currently, 
there 
are 
many 
resources 

dedicated to ACT preparation, including 
courses and tutors. However, there are 
virtually no state-issued or curriculum-
based preparation resources for the SAT. The 
transition process for tutors and students to 
learn a whole new test and set of strategies 
presents must be monitored closely in order to 
avoid creating a learning gap between tests.

Despite possible benefits to this switch, the 

decision to switch to the SAT was first and 
foremost for the state’s economic benefit; it 
was a decision that seemingly did not take into 
account the difficulties families and students 
will face during the transition process. While 
the switch saves the state money that could 
potentially be invested in bettering elementary 
and secondary education, Michigan should 
have been more transparent in its decision 
and included community input in the process. 
However, since the state has already decided 
to move forward with this change, close 
monitoring of schools should be the next step in 
the transition process.

A questionable ACT

Change to SAT in Michigan brings both positives and negatives

‘Bonnie & Clyde’ 
to steal the show

Famous crime duo 

make their way 
to Mendelssohn 

Theatre.

By ALEX BERNARD

Daily Community Culture Editor

Through ice and snow and a 

wind that gives frostbite in the 
same way my mom texts me 
about getting a job (a lot), the 
cast and crew 
of “Bonnie & 
Clyde” lumber 
into rehearsal, 
shake 
off 

the cold, hug 
each other for 
warmth 
and 

settle 
in 
for 

a 
long 
night 

of practice – 
the final run-
through before 
they 
move 

into the Lydia 
Mendelssohn 
Theatre.

The 
space 
buzzes 
with 

movement 
and 
final 

preparations.

The 
assistant 
director 

tightens 
a 
screw 
in 
their 

trapdoor. An actor puts on a 
cowboy hat and clips a sheriff’s 
badge to his zip-up sweater. 
The whole cast pins numbers 
to 
themselves 
– 
makeshift 

microphones until they rehearse 
in a space that isn’t half the 
size of the Mendelssohn. The 
music director calls everyone 
together for warm-ups. 

And then “Bonnie & Clyde” is 

off and running. 

The musical tells the story 

of Bonnie Parker and Clyde 
Barrow, the infamous lovers 
and robbers who spent the 
Great Depression plundering 
and thieving in the central 
United States. Composed by 
Frank Wildhorn, “Bonnie & 
Clyde” opened on Broadway 
in December 2011, and starred 
Laura 
Osnes 
and 
Jeremy 

Jordan. 

This 
time 
around, 
Ann 

Arbor Civic Theatre brings 
“Bonnie & Clyde” to the Lydia 
Mendelssohn 
Theatre 
from 

Thursday, January 15th to the 
18th. Though the Broadway 
version closed after just four 
weeks (much to the chagrin of 
delighted audience members), 
Civic director Ron Baumanis, 
an Ann Arbor Civic Theatre 
veteran, believes crowds will 
be surprised by the musical’s 
unapologetic authenticity. 

In the opening moments of 

“Bonnie & Clyde,” the audience 
sees what a few bullets can do 
to a car door, a windshield and 
two kids. You might worry that 
this could deprive the play of its 
uncertainty and suspense, but 
Baumanis says the opposite is 
true. 

“The fun of a show like this 

is that the audience knows how 
it ends, even though the cast 
members 
don’t,” 
Baumanis 

said. “So the audience sees it 
coming from a mile away and it 
adds to some of the suspense.”

Baumanis is the first to 

admit that Bonnie & Clyde 
were 
anything 
but 
the 

idealized, 
front-page 
news, 

super criminals that history 
remembers them as.

“They were two dumb kids. 

When they died, they were 
25 and 23 ... They were kids. 
Imagine people at U of M 
graduating and suddenly going 
on a killing spree for the next 
two years. And (the police) shot 
‘em down.”

As I watched the cast – out 

of costume, off set – I found 
myself incapable of focusing 
on the notes I was taking for, 
well, this article. After all, how 
can you expect to write if you 
keep tapping your pen to the 
music? 
Stuck-in-your-head 

country numbers like “You’re 
Going Back to Jail” and “When 
I Drive” the gospel punch of 
“God’s Arms Are Always Open” 
Bonnie’s heartbreaking point 
that “Dyin’ Ain’t So Bad.” 

Whatever number it was, I 

had to wait until its end before 
returning to my notes to add 
checks and stars next to the 
song titles: Remember this one 
too. 

The show is a credit to Civic’s 

cast, who range in age from 
over-70s to in eighth grade and 
who will make you forget that 
they’re not earning a paycheck 
for this show. 

“These people are not ‘24/7 

theater.’ They all have jobs 
during the day so they come in 
from whatever they’re doing. 
We 
have 
a 
neurophysicist, 

and we’ve got a doctor and 
we’ve got accountants ... but 
they all have musical theater 
backgrounds,” Baumanis said.

You 
wouldn’t 
know 
it 

watching Baumanis’s cast. As 
Clyde Barrow, Dan Clair leads 
the show with an immensely 
entertaining, 
vein-popping 

vocal performance and an even 
better acting job. There’s no 
pretense or romanticization 
here. Clair’s Barrow is no hero, 
just a kid in way over his head.

Meanwhile, 
his 
Bonnie 

Parker, played by Kimberly 
Elliott, is charged with both 
reviving an American icon 
and not disappearing next to 

Clyde’s massive shadow and 
charisma. Where one might 
strive to outperform, even 
upstage her fellow lead, Elliott 
delivers a considered, cautious 
performance that stands tall 
against 
Clair’s 
electricity, 

setting a key foundation for 
Parker and Barrow’s obsession 
and moral degradation. 

But 
talent 
isn’t 
limited 

to Baumanis’s leads. Kyrie 
Bristle – who plays Blanche 
Barrow, Clyde’s sister-in-law 
– delivers heavy, emotional 
vocals with a nuance and touch 
that makes one wish she had 
her own musical, maybe called, 
“Blanche & Blanche”? I’d see it. 

To prepare their cast and 

the show, Baumanis and his 
music director Tyler Driskill 
received 
some 
first-hand 

advice from the writers of 
the show, including Frank 
Wildhorn.

“Our music director talked 

to Frank Wildhorn and said, 
‘What about this?’ and ‘Why 
this?’ and ‘Why is this harmony 
here?’ And they are super, 
super enthused about making 
their production work, because 
they love this piece of work.”

As though input from the 

director, writers and composer 
wasn’t enough, the cast also 
had a special visit to prepare 
them for the show’s passionate, 
often complicated, material.

“We had one of the cast 

members (Daniel Cooney) from 
the (Broadway) show come in 
and talk about the show and 
what it was like to do it in 
New York. It let the cast ask 
questions about characters ... 
and how people made choices 
about 
how 
they 
present 

certain scenes and songs.”

In their cramped rehearsal 

space, the leads danced two 
feet from my sneakers and 
about three feet from my lap, 
as I remembered something 
Baumanis told me earlier:

“It’s 
a 
more 
intimate 

musical than people are going 
to expect. You get to know 
these characters pretty well.”

The 
show 
will 
use 

projections 
and 
firearms, 

death and country, robbery 
and gospel music. But more 
than anything, Civic’s “Bonnie 
& Clyde” is a story about 
dedication and loyalty ... to a 
fault. 

“These are kids that were 

very much in love,” Baumanis 
said. “Despite the fact they 
were both idiots.”

Theater is just fancy lying; 

but these kids are real. Stupid. 
Hopeful. Doomed. But real. 

After rehearsal, I opened 

the backstage door, stepped 
knee-high into what I imagine 
Greenland feels like, and began 
the long walk home, warmed 
by the fact that I’d be seeing 
these idiots again on Thursday. 
The show starts at 8 p.m. See 
you there.

Expectations for “The Gam-

bler” may be 
for something 
along the lines 
of “21” — a fast-
paced 
thriller 

about 
genius 

gamblers that 
easily make for-
tunes in single 
nights. Instead, 
“The Gambler,” 
a remake of the 
1974 film of the same name, is a study 
of gambling addiction, personal ful-
fillment and self-destruction.

In addition to working as litera-

ture professor at a fictional univer-
sity, Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg, 
“The Departed”) leads a double-
life as a high-stakes gambler. Pos-
sessing an affluent background 
and 
high 
intellect, 
Bennett’s 

potential is obvious – except that 
he can’t walk away from the table 
when he’s up big. Despite many 
advantages and having a desirable 
career, Bennett feels inadequate as 
a writer, leads an apparently empty 
personal life and has a tumultu-
ous relationship with his mother. 
When these problems come to 
a head, Bennett finds himself in 

steep debt to three vicious loan 
sharks – with only seven days to 
pay off the balance.

Surprisingly, 
gambling 
itself 

takes somewhat of a backseat in 
the film’s plot. Bennett’s addiction 
catalyzes the entire story, but little 
screen-time is allotted for actual 
gambling. Unlike the 1974 version, 
the film includes a romance between 
Bennett and one of his students 
(Brie Larson, “21 Jump Street”), a 
prodigious writer whom he openly 
gushes over in front of a large lec-
ture hall. Needless to say, Bennett’s 
teaching methods are unorthodox if 
not downright inappropriate.

Bennett’s profession plays into 

the plot with another student of 
his, a university basketball star and 
non-stop in-class texter, whom 
Bennett approaches about fixing a 
game. The film minimally explores 
this topic, though it raises complex 
questions about the morality of 
cheating for the sake of one’s fam-
ily and the value of sportsmanship.

The film would benefit from 

greater depth to the nature of Ben-
nett’s relationships with his stu-
dents, especially his love interest 
and the basketball star. Apparently 
without any previous history, Ben-
nett feels comfortable approach-
ing both students in remarkably 
forward manners. While this can 

be chalked up to a character trait, 
more development and build-up 
to Bennett’s interactions with his 
students would add to the weight 
they carry.

The most entertaining character 

is Frank (John Goodman, “Flight”), 
one of the loan sharks. Bald and goa-
teed, Frank doesn’t simply resemble 
a fattened Heisenberg, but possess-
es the same crucial characteristic of 
a fierce underground businessman: 
a fuck-you attitude. Though he 
causes trouble for the protagonist, 
Frank also sees Bennett’s potential 
and pushes him to aspire for free-
dom — not only from his debts, but 
also from his own self-destructive 
tendencies.

Director Rupert Wyatt (“Rise of 

the Planet of the Apes”) and editor 
Pete Beaudreau (“All is Lost”) shine 
as bright spots for the film, from the 
opening car sequence to the quick, 
tense cuts during gambling scenes. 
The film also visually makes a nice 
point about students’ texting habits 
during class, with subtle inserts dur-
ing Bennett’s lectures.

“The Gambler” exudes creativ-

ity and sufficiently navigates deep 
themes without attempting to take 
on too much or make too grand of a 
statement. Though no aspects of the 
film are spectacular, every compo-
nent serves its purpose.

Not another sequel!

#KillinItAgain.

By CONRAD FOREMAN

Daily Arts Writer

More is always better when it 

comes to pizza, but sadly that’s 
not the case for movies.

Hollywood loves to overdo 

it with sequels, prequels and 
spin-offs. For example, this year 
will mark the release of the sev-
enth installment in the “Fast 
and Furious” series. There are 
many reasons that studios love 
franchises, but the most obvious 
reason is that no one can really 
ever know whether an original, 
non-sequel movie will be suc-
cessful.

One genre where franchises 

are valued highly is the super-
hero movie. Unless a superhero 
movie really sucks (i.e. “Green 
Lantern” starring Ryan Reyn-
olds), a sequel will almost cer-
tainly be made. But recently, 
franchises have started encom-
passing a wider swath of the 
superhero genre. No longer is a 
hero limited to solely his or her 
own follow-up films: we have 
entered the age of the cinematic 
universe.

We’ll 
begin 
with 
Marvel 

Studios, pioneers of the con-
cept. Marvel’s ever-expanding 
universe was created with the 
2008 release of “Iron Man,” 
a surprisingly successful and 
acclaimed project. This Marvel 
film was the first to include a 
post-credits scene, and boy, was 
it prophetic. The short scene 
depicts Nick Fury speaking to 
Tony Stark. He says, “Mr. Stark, 
you’ve become a part of a bigger 
universe. You just don’t know it 
yet.” 

Sure enough, later in sum-

mer 2008, Tony Stark made a 
post-credits appearance in “The 
Incredible 
Hulk,” 
promising 

audiences that he was “putting 
a team together.” Then came 

“Iron Man 2,” “Captain Amer-
ica: The First Avenger” and 
“Thor,” which all converged in 
2012’s “The Avengers.” Except 
for “The Incredible Hulk,” each 
film has multiple sequels of its 
own, in addition to crossover 
appearances by many charac-
ters.

So far, the model has been 

overwhelmingly successful. The 
last two Marvel installments, 
“Guardians of the Galaxy” and 
“Captain America: The Winter 
Soldier,” were some of the most 
acclaimed of Marvel’s releases, 
and this summer’s “Avengers: 
Age of Ultron” is a safe bet to 
pull in a billion dollars, if not 
more.

Success means these expan-

sive superhero universes aren’t 
going away anytime soon. 20th 
Century Fox decided it wants a 
piece of the action, and is mov-
ing forward in a similar fashion 
with the two Marvel franchises 
to which it owns the rights: 
X-Men and the Fantastic Four. 
2014’s “X- Men: Days of Future 
Past” attempted to tie together 
the story lines of all six previ-
ous X-Men films, at least half 
of which were never meant to 
exist in an overarching uni-
verse, and indeed, this retroac-
tive merging created continuity 
issues. Beyond this, Fox has a 
reboot for “The Fantastic Four” 
set to hit theaters this August, 
and its sequel already has a 
release date, (set even before its 

predecessor even started shoot-
ing). 

DC Entertainment, in compe-

tition with Marvel, has begun 
constructing its own cinematic 
superhero universe, building on 
2013’s “Man of Steel” and the 
upcoming “Batman v. Super-
man: Dawn of Justice.” Char-
acters like The Flash, Wonder 
Woman and Aquaman will all 
get solo films, before ultimate-
ly coming together for a “Jus-
tice League” movie.

My point is that maybe these 

studios are biting off a bit more 
than they can chew. Marvel 
will release 11 more movies 
into its universe between now 
and 2019, including sequels 
for “Captain America,” “Thor” 
and “The Avengers,” as well as 
outside-the-box choices “Ant-
Man,” “Black Panther” and 
“Captain Marvel.” In addition, 
Marvel produces the television 
series “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” 
which also exists in Marvel’s 
movie universe. Only the die-
hardest of die-hard fans can 
keep up with every character 
and plot, and while that must 
certainly be rewarding for a 
select few, where does that 
leave casual fans?

The real question, though, is 

how does it end? What will hap-
pen when Robert Downey Jr. 
is too old to play Iron Man, or 
when Samuel L. Jackson is sick 
of playing Nick Fury? It seems 
likely that the films’ canon may 
soon become as convoluted as 
their source comics, meaning 
that finding a conclusion satis-
fying to fans, that also ties up 
loose ends, will be virtually 
impossible.

Are Marvel Studios and oth-

ers taking the trend of cinematic 
universes too far? I don’t know, 
but trying to keep up with these 
vast stories sure is exhausting.

“It’s a more 

intimate 

musical than 

people expect.”

Hollywood 

loves to overdo 
it with sequels.

Blind ‘Hindsight’ 

VH1

I’ll be there for youuuuuuuuuu!

Poor writing and 
unoriginality hold 

back VH1’s new 

series

By KAREN HUA

Daily TV/New Media Editor

Despite 
an 
intriguing, 
if 

unoriginal, premise, the pilot of 
VHI’s “Hindsight” is full of cli-
chés. In areas 
where 
the 

writers 
could 

have offered a 
fresh lens, they 
succumbed 
to 
hackneyed 

plot points and 
awkward dia-
logue. 

Becca 

(Laura 
Ramsey, 
“She’s 
the 

Man”) is a woman past her 
prime 
– 
the 
middle-aged 

romantic finds herself facing a 
second wedding, as she is now 
engaged to a man (Nick Clif-
ford, “The Opportunist”) she 
once found repulsive. Even now 
that she has discovered “new 
love,” Becca remains perpetu-
ally unhappy with her love life 
and career. But just as she wal-
lows in self-pity about how she 
reached her discontented state, 

Becca suddenly finds herself 
rewound to her first wedding 
day in 1995. How opportune – 
and how overused.

Becca’s past life features her 

hunk of an Australian fiancé 
(Craig Horner, “Legend of the 
Seeker”) and her once insepa-
rable, eventually estranged best 
friend Lolly (Sarah Goldberg, 
“The Dark Knight Rises”). Soft 
grunge is back in vogue, as are 
choker necklaces, pagers and 
AOL. Her first day caught in 
the past consists of begging 
Lolly to believe she’s from the 
future, and contemplating the 
love and happiness so elusive to 
her life. Becca is determined to 
use this opportunity to live life 
differently without making the 
same bad mistakes, which cul-
minated in the ever-so-original 
run from the altar. However, 
the show’s stock dramatic irony 
is that we foresee Becca mak-
ing different mistakes – ones 
that just lead to a life of dif-
ferent unhappiness. The show 
is reminiscent of “13 Going on 
30,” except Ramsey can’t quite 
exude that retro presence like 
Jennifer Garner.

Becca and Lolly’s friendship 

is uplifting, but the other rela-
tionships have little potential 
for development. Additionally, 
many plot aspects feel forced, 
especially when Lolly almost 

immediately believes Becca’s 
time-traveling scheme. Lolly’s 
blind assumption has less to 
do with her adherent devotion 
to her best friend, and more 
with an unbelievable lack of 
awareness. The show gradual-
ly becomes too scripted, which 
flattens all the characters, 
including the protagonist.

The script allows for good 

introspection, as the audience 
hears Becca’s every thought, 
pondering questions we must 
all ask ourselves about the 
meaning of happiness and the 
existence of fate. As inspi-
rational as this initially may 
be, her inner dialogue soon 
becomes juvenile, every line 
rewording 
empty 
truisms 

with clunky philosophical lan-
guage. Ultimately, the writing 
feels lazy – using voiceovers 
and 
external 
narration 
to 

recount exposition. It breaks 
a crucial law of writing: the 
necessity to trust audience 
intelligence. 

While “Hindsight” ’s pilot 

has some redeemable qualities, 
its unoriginal script hampers 
its potential, wasting a poten-
tially compelling premise. Not 
only does Becca rewind the 
clock, but the show reverts 
back to overdramatic, stale sit-
com tropes as well.

‘Living Different’ 
struggles to subvert

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

“I never in my life would have 

guessed that I’d 
be giving tes-
tosterone shots 
to my girlfriend 
once a week to 
turn her into a 
man.”

The 
pre-

miere 
episode 

of 
Oxygen’s 

new four-part 
special “Living 
Different” kicked off with this line, 
immediately letting viewers know 
that they were about to get a fresh 
take on what exactly “different” 
means from a group of nine women 
from a variety of backgrounds. 

This episode, titled “#Love-

WithoutLabels,” focuses on two of 
the nine: Lizz, a woman who has 
been warily anticipating telling 
her conservative Mexican Catho-
lic family that her girlfriend is not 
only her girlfriend but also trans-
gender, and Rain, a woman whose 
androgynous looks allow her to 
model as both a man and a woman. 
As a show that actively focuses on 
groups that have been silenced by 
the media and have experienced 
prejudice before, it has potential to 
help spread new understandings of 

different sexualities and lifestyles. 

Lizz is the first of her fam-

ily to graduate from college, and 
she struggles with whether to tell 
her family when they come for 
her graduation that her partner is 
transgender. She has to deal with 
the reactions of both her family 
and friends, one of whom asks her 
in a puzzled tone as they sit in a bar, 
“Are you gay or are you bi? Because 
if she’s turning into a boy … ” 

Rain was mistakenly booked as a 

male on her first modeling gig; she 
goes along with it and models as 
both genders. She is more comfort-
able with male modeling shoots and 
is nervous doing a lingerie shoot in 
this episode, as she hints she may 
be developing a crush on her female 
photographer. Additionally, Rain 
grapples with wanting a relation-
ship with her emotionally distant 
father, as her ease with and control 
of her own gender fluidity — espe-
cially modeling as a man but dating 
both men and women — makes him 
uncomfortable. 

As with most reality TV, the 

danger with this show lies in the 
potential to be exploitative instead 
of explanatory, pernicious instead 
of progressive — and the premiere 
episode leaves viewers distrust-
ful, still wondering which way 
the show will go. The camera’s 
influence on all of the people in 

the show is all too apparent, even 
for reality TV, and the resulting 
awkwardness in stilted conver-
sations is palpable. Further, the 
long-winded and smooth solilo-
quy-esque voiceovers don’t feel 
authentic. However, there are 
flashes that demonstrate a concern 
for portraying the genuine frustra-
tion of those who don’t conform 
to societal norms. Such instances 
as Lizz’s reaction to her brother’s 
misunderstanding the meaning of 
transgender (“Gay? I mean I don’t 
want to get into all the details … ”) 
and Rain’s wondering tone when 
she says, “This whole androgynous 
thing is actually paying the bills,” 
are particularly powerful. 

Though 
“Living 
Different” 

doesn’t feel like it’s quite living up to 
its title yet, it shows brief glimpses 
of what reality looks like for people 
in these unconventional situa-
tions, contributing to discussion 
about representation of diversity 
in media. Future episodes will fea-
ture Hasidic musicians, an MMA 
fighter and a psychic-medium, 
among others. These are all women 
who are used to others questioning 
their lifestyles or choices, and they 
seem united in a certain hope: that 
by watching them push boundar-
ies and live in acceptance of them-
selves, audiences might be inspired 
to do the same.

Groutfit chic 

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Gray sweats, gray crew neck. 

We have all done it at some 
point: the unmistakable and 
completely atrocious groutfit (a 
portmanteau of gray and outfit, 
if you live under a rock). There 
are two distinct roots behind a 
mind that chooses an all gray 
getup: 1) You, like my father, 
simply don’t care what you’re 
wearing, especially if it is just 
around the house, or 2) you, like 
me, have lost your mind and 
your life is just in shambles (see: 
finals week). So, my question is: 
if someone with a decent sense 
of fashion like myself opts for an 
ensemble representative of all 
50 shades of grey, why must you 
kick me when I am down?

Comments come from sib-

lings, verbal harassment from 
friends and “oh, honey” looks 
come from hall mates. Grout-
fit rockers understand they 
exceed the comfort levels of 
others with their choices, but 
believe me when I say groutfits 
are the official uniforms of rock 
bottom. Once there are three 
essays, a French presentation 
and a Michigan Daily article on 
the line, fashion goes out the 
window, down a hill and drowns 
itself in tears and coffee. Instead 
of the aforementioned reac-
tions, give a hug, thumbs up or 

a slightly creepy wink to show 
you’ve been there too.

As a personal rule, I try my 

hardest to never leave the house 
in my groutfit and all its great-
ness, but hey, shit happens. A 
quick trip for Kroger sushi does 
not present enough motivation 
to put on a different colored pair 
of sweatpants or sweatshirt. 
So we can extend the family 
and friends rule to strangers in 
supermarkets … 

You know my groutfit, not my 

story. So kindly step off and let 
me have my $4 California roll 
with a sliver of dignity.

What’s even with the color 

gray? Why are my gray sweat-
pants so much more enjoyable 
than my black ones? Why is my 
gray UM crew neck superior 
to the blue one? Maybe it is all 
in my mind and that of my fel-
low groutfitters … (Just realized 
Urban Groutfitters would be a 
great Etsy store). 

Also, in defense of the color 

gray: is there a better color 
(excluding black) to create an 
entire outfit out of? A student in 
my high school once wore green 
sweatpants and a green sweat-
shirt (he went to State … if that 
needed further explanation). It 
was awful, and I would pick a 
groutfit any day over a greenfit. 
Or a red, blue or yellow ensem-
ble as well.

From one groutfitter to the 

rest: embrace it, and don’t let 
any person in jeans tell you shit. 
Rocking a groutfit is rocking a 
state of mind – a state of mind 
that says “leave me alone and 
let me desperately try to get 
my life together.” And for those 
who wear groutfits because 
they just don’t know anything 
about dressing themselves (I’m 
talking to all of the fathers out 
there): stop. You’re making the 
rest of us look like fools.

Same-sex marriage 
ban unconstitutional 

Senior executive 

says the project will 

not use public or 
taxpayer dollars

LOS ANGELES (AP) - The 

developers behind a sprawling 
sports and housing complex 
in the Los Angeles suburbs — 
whose 
centerpiece 
stadium 

could become home for an NFL 
team — expect to recoup up to 
$100 million in local tax dollars 
in the first five years of opera-
tion, an Associated Press review 
has found. 

When 
the 
proposal 
was 

unveiled last week, Christopher 
Meany, a senior executive with 
the joint venture designing and 
financing the project, empha-
sized that “there will be no pub-
lic dollars, no taxpayer dollars, 
used for this project.”

While the plan does not 

include any upfront tax money 
to build the 298-acre community 
of homes, offices and entertain-
ment venues, a 187-page outline 
released by developers includes 
provisions 
for 
multimillion-

dollar public paybacks to them 
over time from tax dollars gen-
erated by the project, which 
would cover costs ranging from 
installing street lights and fire 
hydrants to running shuttle 
buses and providing police secu-

rity on game days.

The documents submitted to 

officials in Inglewood, where 
the stadium would be built, say 
that if annual tax revenue to the 
city from the completed project 
exceeds $25 million as expect-
ed, the developers, including 
a company controlled by the 
owner of the St. Louis Rams, 
would be entitled to reimburse-
ments for funds they invested in 
streets, sewers, parks and other 
projects deemed dedicated to 
the public.

Chicago-based sports finance 

consultant Marc Ganis said 
claiming no tax money would 
be used in the project is “hyper-
spin” and could damage the 
project’s credibility.

“It’s not an outright lie ... but 

there will be people who think 
it is,” Ganis said. “They might 
be prospective tax dollars, and 
it might make sense for Ingle-
wood to contribute them to the 
project, but they are tax dol-
lars.”

Inglewood 
officials 
are 

reviewing the proposal, but 
Mayor James Butts said the 
deal appears favorable because 
the city isn’t required to invest 
hundreds of millions of dollars 
into the development. The city 
about 10 miles from downtown 
Los Angeles could end up with a 
steady source of tax income and 
a vibrant entertainment mecca, 
he said.

“We get revenue that we 

didn’t have to make a financial 
investment for. That is unheard 
of in a project of this magni-
tude,” Butts said.

The proposal envisions a 

domed, 80,000-seat stadium ris-
ing on the site of a defunct horse 
track and would also include a 
6,000-seat performance venue 
and parking. 

It’s the latest in a string of 

stadium proposals in the Los 
Angeles area since the Rams and 
the Oakland Raiders abandoned 
Southern California after the 
1994 season.

According to the plan, devel-

opers could be reimbursed an 
estimated $50 million to $60 
million for building the struc-
tural backbone of the site: 
sidewalks and road work, land-
scaping, water mains and utility 
lines. 

Meany said in a statement 

that those costs are expected to 
be paid back within the first few 
years from tax revenue generat-
ed by the project, and they rep-
resent a fraction of the overall 
investment.

Additionally, the records say 

developers can be reimbursed by 
the city for costs on event days 
for police, emergency medical 
crews and shuttle bus services 
from off-site parking. 

They estimate that could tally 

$8 million annually, or $40 mil-
lion for a five-year period.

New Mexico police officers 
charged in shooting ill man

Camera footage 

shows police killing 
mentally ill homeless 

man in March

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) 

— Two Albuquerque police offi-
cers were charged with murder 
Monday in the shooting death of 
a knife-wielding homeless man 
that led to sometimes violent pro-
tests and a federal investigation 
into the city’s police force.

The decision to bring murder 

charges occurred at a time when 
police tactics are under intense 
scrutiny nationwide, fueled by 
the fatal shooting of an unarmed 
18-year-old in Ferguson, Mis-
souri, and the chokehold death 
of another unarmed man in New 
York City. Grand juries declined 
to charge officers in those cases, 
leading to large protests.

Acknowledging 
the 
frus-

tration over the secrecy of the 
proceedings in those cases, the 
Albuquerque 
district 
attorney 

said she would bypass the grand 
jury process and instead present 
the murder case to a judge at a 
preliminary hearing that will be 
open to the public.

“Unlike Ferguson and unlike 

in New York City, we’re going to 
know. The public is going to have 
that information,” District Attor-
ney Kari Brandenburg said.

Police said SWAT team mem-

ber Dominique Perez and former 
detective Keith Sandy fatally shot 
James Boyd, a mentally ill home-
less man who had frequent violent 
run-ins with law enforcement. 
Video from an officer’s helmet 

camera showed Boyd appear-
ing to surrender when officers 
opened fire, but a defense lawyer 
characterized him as an unstable 
suspect who was “unpredict-
ably and dangerously close to a 
defenseless officer while he was 
wielding two knives.”

“I’m looking forward ... to the 

DA’s office presenting one single 
witness that says this is murder,” 
said Sam Bergman, a lawyer for 
Sandy.

The district attorney refused 

to provide specifics about the 
reasons for bringing the case, but 
said it was a lengthy and delib-
erate process involving several 
members of her staff.

Each officer faces a single count 

in the March death of the 38-year-
old Boyd. The charges allow 
prosecutors to pursue either first-
degree or second-degree murder 
against the officers.

Even before Boyd’s death, the 

U.S. Justice Department was 
investigating the use of force by 
Albuquerque police. The depart-
ment recently signed an agree-
ment to make changes after 
the government issued a harsh 
report. The agreement requires 
police to provide better training 
for officers and to dismantle trou-
bled units.

Since 2010, Albuquerque police 

have been involved in 40 shoot-
ings — 27 of them deadly. After 
Boyd’s death, outrage over the 
trend grew and culminated with 
protests that included a demon-
stration where authorities fired 
tear gas and another that shut 
down a City Council meeting.

The criminal charges were the 

first Brandenburg has brought 
against officers in a shooting. 

She is in her fourth term as dis-
trict attorney and is waging a 
fight with the Albuquerque Police 
Department over allegations that 
she committed bribery while 
intervening on behalf of her son 
in a burglary case.

Police believe she should be 

charged with bribery because, 
they say, she offered to pay a 
victim not to press charges. The 
attorney general’s office is han-
dling the matter.

Brandenburg said the charges 

against police had nothing to 
with the agency’s investigation 
into her and that her office got 
the case long before the bribery 
claims came to light.

The next step in the case will 

be a preliminary hearing where 
a judge will decide whether the 
case can proceed. The officers 
have not been booked or arrest-
ed. That would not happen until 
a judge renders a decision at the 
preliminary hearing. A date has 
not been set.

Brandenburg has been criti-

cized for her office’s decades-old 
practice of using grand juries 
to affirm prosecutors’ decisions 
that no probable cause existed to 
charge officers in shootings.

Under a revamped system, 

county prosecutors now decide 
whether there’s probable cause 
that a crime was committed and 
either take the case to a grand jury 
or opt to file a “criminal informa-
tion” charge on their own.

Bregman said there is “not one 

shred” of evidence to support 
the case and insisted the officer 
had no criminal intent when he 
encountered Boyd. He said Sandy 
followed training procedures out-
lined by the police department.

South Dakota judge 
says couples have 

right to marry

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — A 

federal judge on Monday declared 
South Dakota’s same-sex mar-
riage ban unconstitutional, but 
marriage licenses won’t be imme-
diately issued because the ruling 
was put on hold pending a poten-
tial appeal.

U.S. District Judge Karen Sch-

reier sided in favor of the six cou-
ples who filed the lawsuit in May 
in Sioux Falls. 

The lawsuit challenges a 1996 

state law and a voter-approved 
2006 constitutional amendment 
that ban gay marriage.

“Plaintiffs have a fundamental 

right to marry,” Schreier wrote. 
“South Dakota law deprives them 
of that right solely because they 

are same-sex couples and without 
sufficient justification.”

Attorney General Marty Jack-

ley on Monday said the state will 
appeal the case to the 8th U.S. Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals, a conserva-
tive-leaning federal appeals court 
that in 2006 affirmed Nebraska’s 
right to ban same-sex marriages.

“It remains the state’s position 

that the institution of marriage 
should be defined by the voters of 
South Dakota and not the federal 
courts,” Jackley said.

He said he’s obligated by law to 

defend both the state constitution 
and state statutes.

Two other states — Arkan-

sas and Missouri — already have 
appealed similar federal district 
court rulings to the 8th Circuit. 
The U.S. Supreme Court again is 
considering whether to hear a gay 
marriage case, and more appeals 
court rulings — especially if they 
conflict — could increase the like-

lihood the justices will do so.

In November, the 6th Circuit 

Court of Appeals based in Cin-
cinnati became the first appel-
late court to recently uphold 
state bans on same-sex mar-
riage. 

Plaintiffs 
from 
Kentucky, 

Michigan, Ohio and Tennes-
see are asking the court to 
reverse that decision. Four other 
appeals courts — based in Chi-
cago, Denver, San Francisco 
and Richmond, Virginia — have 
ruled in favor of gay and lesbian 
couples. Arguments over bans in 
three Southern states were held 
last week before a New Orleans-
based appellate court.

Romero said that the more 

cases that are pending at the 8th 
Circuit will only increase the 
pressure on that court to issue its 
ruling. But the court could put 
the cases on hold if the Supreme 
Court decides to take on the issue.

Attacks on outlet, 

threats to film lead to 
international outcry

LONDON (AP) — These are 

dark days for those who want to 
believe that the pen is mightier 
than the sword.

The attack on French satirical 

newspaper Charlie Hebdo has 
caused grief and soul-searching 
around the world, and exposed 
the risks humorists can run 
— only intensified in an era of 
instant global communications 
where starkly opposed ideolo-
gies can collide.

British 
cartoonist 
Gerald 

Scarfe expressed his anguish 
in the Sunday Times newspa-
per with the image of a sword 
slicing off a hand holding a pen. 
In the Sunday Telegraph, Bob 
Moran depicted a cartoonist in 
full body armor under the slo-
gan “Keep Calm and Carry On.”

For centuries, satirical sto-

ries and cartoons have mocked 
the powerful and sacred in the 
societies that produced them. 
Often they drew a harsh reac-
tion. Offending an absolute 
monarch could mean death. 
Well into the 20th century, 
comedians from Lenny Bruce to 
the editors of British magazine 

Oz were prosecuted for offend-
ing society’s sensibilities.

Today, societies in countries 

like France are more diverse 
than ever before. Once over-
whelmingly Catholic, France 
is a now an officially secular 
country with 5 million Muslims, 
about 7.5 percent of the popula-
tion. There’s less consensus 
on what’s taboo and where the 
boundaries of taste and offense 
lie.

And now that words and 

images move around the world 
at the click of a mouse, there 
more chance for provocative 
humor to collide with rigid 
ideas, whether Islamic funda-
mentalism or North Korean 
communism.

When comedian Seth Rogen 

and his collaborators chose 
the imagined assassination of 
North Korean dictator Kim 
Jong Un, who presides over 
one of the world’s most isolated 
countries, as the plot of slacker 
comedy “The Interview,” the 
distant leader took offense. 
North Korea condemned the 
movie as an “unpardonable 
mockery of our sovereignty and 
dignity of our supreme leader.” 
There were threats against U.S. 
movie theaters, and Sony was 
hit by a cyberattack that spilled 
sensitive commercial data and 

embarrassing emails across the 
Internet. (U.S. authorities have 
blamed North Korea for the 
hack, though some cybersecu-
rity experts have their doubts).

Charlie Hebdo springs from 

a French satirical tradition that 
reaches back to the republic’s 
revolutionary roots: rude, sca-
brous, an enemy of power and 
piety. Its targets have included 
popes, politicians — and the 
Prophet 
Muhammad. 
Many 

Muslims believe all images of 
the prophet are blasphemous; 
Charlie Hebdo’s cartoons could 
be deliberately crude and outra-
geous, once showing Muham-
mad as a star in a porn shoot.

Some witnesses reported that 

the attackers who killed 12 peo-
ple at the paper’s offices shouted 
“We have avenged the prophet.”

The attack is another bloody 

chapter in a story that stretch-
es back to Salman Rushdie’s 
1988 novel “The Satanic Vers-
es,” whose ironic take on the 
prophet drew a death edict from 
Iran’s religious authorities. The 
British Rushdie lived in hid-
ing under police protection for 
years. Many miles from both 
Britain and Iran, his Japanese 
translator was stabbed to death. 
Rushdie’s Italian translator and 
Norwegian publisher were also 
attacked, but survived.

Elmblad, Goree 
head into final 

chapter of 

illustrious careers

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

With 1:05 left in overtime, 

senior forward Cyesha Goree 
leapt up to the glass and 
grabbed an offensive rebound 
after senior guard Shannon 
Smith missed both of her free 
throws.

Fourteen 
seconds 
later, 

Goree drew a foul and had to 
step up to the line herself. After 
missing both of her free throws, 
she fought her way to the rim 
and pulled down yet another 
offensive 
board, 
her 
18th 

rebound of the night.

This was Ohio State she was 

playing, after all, and she wasn’t 
going to let anyone else benefit 
from her mistakes.

Goree grabbed one more at 

the glass before the game ended 
in a 100-94 victory for the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team. It’s easy to assume that 
the game would have concluded 
in a much different fashion if 
Goree hadn’t scrapped for 19 
rebounds.

But that would be assuming 

that 
senior 
forward 
Nicole 

Elmblad wasn’t there to help 
her out.

Elmblad — who ended the 

afternoon with nine rebounds 
herself — always complements 
Goree well.

“It’s great to show how no 

matter what position you play 
or what kind of person you bring 
to the team, you can always play 
if you know each other, and we 
worked on (our dynamics) a lot 
in practice a few days,” Goree 
said.

Added Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico: “I think they had 
a really great week of practice 

this week. We really worked on 
(Elmblad and Goree) playing 
off each other, and I think they 
connected really well tonight. 
Really well.”

The 
two 

have 
been 

playing 
together 
since 
their 

freshman year 
under 
then-

Michigan 
coach 
Kevin 

Borseth. 
They’re 
also 

the only two 
remaining 
from their original recruiting 
class.

After 
completing 
their 

first season of college ball 
and learning how to play in 
the NCAA, they had to face 
adversity together once again. 
Borseth resigned, and Barnes 
Arico was hired before their 
sophomore season.

Even with the makeup of 

the program changing, Goree 

and Elmblad have remained 
consistent for the past four 
seasons.

Before 
Goree 
had 
her 

breakout junior season, Elmblad 

was 
already 

a 
regular 

starter for the 
Wolverines.

“(Elmblad) 

was 
able 

to 
play 
her 

freshman 
year 
and 

play a lot her 
sophomore 
year, so that 
kind of made 

me look up to her as far as what 
I needed to do in order to be 
successful and play like she 
did,” Goree said. “That gave 
me someone to look up to, even 
though we were the same age 
and came together.”

But after a season in which 

she averaged 12.1 points and 9.3 
rebounds, Goree found herself 
on the scouting report alongside 
Elmblad. They each started 32 

out of 33 games in their junior 
season.

After 
each 
game, 
the 

coaching staff awards stickers 
to the players who execute the 
“intangibles” — things that 
don’t show up in the box score, 
like diving after the ball, taking 
a charge or fighting for position 
under the basket.

According to Barnes Arico, 

Goree and Elmblad are head 
and shoulders above everyone 
else.

And since both appear most 

comfortable 
when 
they’re 

sprawled out on the court 
fighting for the ball, the image 
of one helping another off of the 
hardwood is ingrained in every 
Michigan fan’s brain.

“It’s an honor to play with 

Nicole,” Goree said. “I’m so glad 
we’re both here together and 
finishing our years (together).”

Without 
the 
other, 
each 

would still be successful. Both 
have the necessary drive to 
prosper.

It’s just more fun this way.

The Michigan men’s bas-

ketball team appears to have 
bounced back 
from a rough 
non-confer-
ence showing 
with a 3-1 start 
to Big Ten play. 
But the road 
gets 
tougher 

when it travels 
to 
Columbus 

on Tuesday for 
a rivalry clash 
with No. 20 
Ohio State.

Despite 

having 
won 

the last three games in the series, 
the Wolverines (3-1 Big Ten, 10-6 
overall) are clear underdogs. 
Three seniors form the core of the 
starting lineup for the Buckeyes 
(2-2, 13-4), and that trio includes 
Shannon Scott, who averages 7.2 
assists per game, good for fifth in 
the country.

Many of Scott’s assists have 

come thanks to the offensive 
prowess of Ohio State guard 
D’Angelo Russell, who ranks 
second in the nation in scoring 
among true freshmen, averaging 
17.9 points. Russell, who stands 
6-foot-5, presents a challenge for 
whoever ends up guarding him — 
likely junior guard Caris LeVert, 

who has been known for his 
defensive skills since his fresh-
man season.

Michigan coach John Beilein 

has taken notice of Russell’s 
efforts, and praised him effu-
sively.

“He’s got the unique skill set 

right now,” Beilein said. “He’s 
really shooting the ball well … 
And with his assist numbers, he’s 
got flow to his game that is just, 
he snap-passes the ball, he sees 
(the floor), he’s got great quick-
ness and a nose for the rim, gets 
to the foul line enough.”

Though they have benefited 

from it in years past, the Wol-
verines can’t currently relate to 
the concept of having a freshman 
post such dominant figures in the 
opening months of his career.

Beilein’s young squad features 

just three upperclassmen and a 
plethora of freshmen who have 
yet to contribute in a major way, 
and taking on a ranked team 
laden with seniors presents a 
daunting challenge.

While talented, Michigan’s 

newcomers have yet to contrib-
ute at the same level as Russell, or 
come particularly close. Though 
freshman forward Ricky Doyle 
has shown marked improvement 
throughout the season, no other 
Wolverine freshman is averaging 
over five points per game. And if 
Michigan wants to maintain its 
early-season Big Ten success in 

the long-term, it couldn’t hurt to 
see more of its rookie class bump 
its productivity and join Doyle 
among the ranks of Michigan’s 
consistent contributors.

“They’ve all had their little 

points during the season,” Beilein 
said, citing Doyle and Chatman’s 
performance in the Wolverines’ 
68-65 win over Syracuse on Dec. 
2. Beilein also pointed to freshman 
guards Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman and Aubrey Dawkins as 
others who have shown occasion-
al sparks of productivity.

Adding the hostile road atmo-

sphere and rivalry pressure is 
the cherry on top, but in Beilein’s 
mind, it all represents yet another 
opportunity for growth.

“All the (Big Ten) venues are 

very similar in that they’re loud,” 
Beilein said. “The student bodies 
are very innovative.”

Albrecht agreed, stating that his 

role — along with that of LeVert, 
plus sophomores Zak Irvin and 
Derrick Walton Jr. — is critical in 
keeping the Wolverines’ youngest 
contributors’ heads in the game, 
something they’ve struggled with 
in other high-pressure situations 
on the road.

“I probably can’t share some 

of the things their fans say,” 
Albrecht said. “It’s going to be a 
very hostile environment, very 
similar to Arizona, so we’ve got 
to do a much better job this time 
around.”

‘M’ looks to stay hot at OSU Behind Enemy Lines: 

OSU’s Sam Thompson

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Sam Thompson remembers 

what it’s like to transition to 
college basketball. Ohio State’s 
senior 
forward 
averaged 
just 
two 

points 
and fewer 
than 
two 

shots 
per 

game in his 
freshman campaign.

During 
his 
first 
season, 

Thompson was able to learn 
from veteran Buckeyes how 
to adapt to the nuances of the 
college game, en route to a Final 
Four appearance.

Now, Thompson is the veteran 

voice in the locker room of an 
Ohio State squad led by a true 
freshman — highly touted guard 
D’Angelo Russell. And with the 
Buckeyes’ early exit from last 
season’s 
NCAA 
Tournament 

serving as motivation, the senior 
will be tasked with ensuring 
a smooth transition for Ohio 
State’s young talent.

If Thompson can guide Russell 

into his groove, the Buckeyes 
have enough experience around 
the floor to return to the type of 
success Thompson experienced 
in his first years at Ohio State, 
in which the 
Buckeyes 
made 
trips 

to the Final 
Four and Elite 
Eight.

The 

Michigan 
Daily 
sat 

down 
with 

Thompson in 
October at Big Ten Media Day 
in Chicago to talk about his 
leadership role and what Russell 
and others bring to this year’s 
roster.

The Michigan Daily: You 

had a ton of success coming 

into college with a couple state 
championships in high school 
and a Final Four your freshman 
year. Has the last year or two 
made you appreciate that even 
more?

Sam Thompson: Yeah, I 

mean, my sophomore year we 
had some success too. We were 
a tip-in away from winning 
another Big Ten Championship, 
we won the Big Ten Tournament, 
we made the Elite Eight. But I 
think last year really put things 
into perspective, how easy it 
is to go from an elite level of 
college basketball to the kind of 
disappointing 
season we had. 
Last year was 
definitely 
a 

humbling year. 
It really makes 
you appreciate 
every 
day 

that 
much 

more. 
Every 

day it’s so important to get 
better — to get something out 
of that practice, something out 
of that game, something out of 
that workout — so that you can 
continue to get better and be the 
best basketball team you can be.

TMD: 
How 
different 
do 

you think things will be with 
Shannon 
Scott 
running 
the 

offense rather than Aaron Craft?

ST: I think we’ll be a lot faster. 

Shannon 
is 

one 
of 
the 

fastest 
guys 

I’ve ever seen 
baseline 
to 

baseline with 
the ball in his 
hand. I think 
we’ll 
have 

better 
pace 

offensively, 

and he’s really shown a lot of 
good things in practice. He’s 
really been vocal, really made 
shots, really made plays for his 
teammates and himself. I’m 
excited about it. I know he is.

TMD: What is it like to be 

able to rely on some freshmen 
this year?

ST: Those young guys are 

super, super talented. They’re 
wise beyond their years. They 
can do a lot of different things. 
They’re freshmen, so obviously 
there’s going to be a little bit of 
an adjustment time, but they’re 
crazy talented, so they can help 
us win.

TMD: What have you taken 

away from the older players 
you’ve had above you, and how 
will you pass it on to this year’s 
freshman crop?

ST: It’s just about my everyday 

approach. It’s 
about 
how 

I 
approach 

every practice, 
every 
shot, 

using 
every 

opportunity 
I can to get 
better. 
It’ll 

show in the 

games.

TMD: Who’s the biggest 

clown on this year’s team?

ST: 
D’Angelo 
Russell. 

Well, it’s really all four of the 
freshmen. Those guys are wild 
dudes, man. They come in with 
some confidence, they’ve got 
some swagger to them.

TMD: What’s going to be the 

biggest difference in you guys 
this year?

ST: Offensively, I think that 

we’re gonna be a very different 
basketball team. I don’t think 
we’re going to have one guy 
dribble the ball for 15, 20, 25 
seconds. I think there will be 
a lot more player movement, 
a lot more ball movement, the 
ball moving from side to side. 
Definitely a lot more athletic. 
I think we’re more talented 
than we’ve been in the last few 
years. We’ve got the size, we’ve 
got the athleticism, we have the 
shooting. We have the tools. 
So it’s all about how we put it 
together and how we grow as a 
basketball team.

A duo years in the making ‘M’ looks to cure 

road struggles

By JEREMY SUMMITT

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan hockey team 

has won eight of its past nine 
games and has scored 5.8 goals 
per 
game 
in 

five conference 
matchups, 
enough to propel it to the top spot 
in the Big Ten standings. All of 
that sounds fine, but hardly any 
of it will matter for the next six 
weeks. Why?

The Wolverines have to play 

games on the road — six of them in 
the next month — an assignment 
that has become a bewildering 
problem for them. Holding a 1-5 
record this season in road games, 
there hasn’t been any rhyme or 
reason for their shortcomings.

“Whether it’s been special 

teams, our goalie, our defensive 
play, we’ve got to get better in our 
D-zone and our overall defensive 
game,” Berenson said. “Whether 
it’s back-checking, penalty killing 
(or) goalkeeping, I think we’re a 
better team now, and we’re going 
on the road, but we’ve got to 
prove it on Friday.”

Michigan 
has 
a 
real 

opportunity to distance itself 
from the rest of the conference if 
it can crack the code to winning 
in another team’s barn. Of those 
six away games, four are against 
Ohio 
State 
and 
Wisconsin, 

two teams unable to find any 
consistency this season.

Six games against what have 

arguably been the conference’s 
three 
most 
underachieving 

teams typically comprise a slate 
destined for success.

But the Wolverines are a 

completely different team on the 
road, getting outscored by an 
average of 4.33 to 2.83.

HYMAN HUMMING: Zach 

Hyman is enjoying a dynamite 
season at the right time, when 

Michigan has needed a consistent 
leader the most.

He broke out last season when 

Hyman recorded a career-best 17 
points (seven goals and 10 assists) 
in 35 games. This season, he’s 
already surpassed that in just 
19 games, scoring 11 goals to go 
along with 15 helpers.

“I think it’s his time,” Berenson 

said. “I predicted before the year 
that Zach Hyman would have 
his best year. Right from his 
freshman year, things didn’t go 
as well, sophomore year a little 
better, junior year a big step. And 
I could just see it coming.”

Last year, a large root of why 

Michigan failed to live up to 
expectations was that it lacked a 
consistent goal scorer, a player to 
take over when games got tight or 
when the Wolverines fell behind.

In 
Friday’s 
4-3 
overtime 

win against Minnesota, it was 
Hyman who delivered a no-look, 
backhand pass to junior forward 
Justin Selman, who finished to 
tie the game.

“This is a classic case of a 

college player just developing 
every year and getting better, and 
now he’s coming into his own,” 
Berenson 
said. 
“Everything 

comes together — your strength, 
your experience, your confidence, 
your role on the team — and he’s 
ready now to handle a role that 
he wasn’t ready to handle as a 
freshman or a sophomore.”

TROUBLE FOR TRAVIS: In 

the second period of Saturday’s 
7-5 win over Minnesota, senior 
forward Travis Lynch laid out to 
block a shot and was immediately 
shaken up. 

On 
Monday, 
Berenson 

confirmed that Lynch suffered 
a broken right hand, and that 
he’ll be sidelined for at least one 
month, meaning that the earliest 
he could return to the lineup 
would be Feb. 13 at Minnesota.
