On Thursday afternoon, the 
Ross School of Business hosted the 
first session of the ninth annual 
Michigan India Conference in 
the Robertson Auditorium. The 
theme of this year’s conference, 
which was first held in 2011, was 
“Moving Beyond Emerging,” and 
was focused at analyzing and 
comparing emerging markets — 
countries that have some elements 
of a fully developed market, 
but are not quite at that status. 
The first day’s keynote speakers 
included D. Shivakumar, president 
of Aditya Birla Group, and Harry 
Broadman, former White House 

trade advisor. Both discussed 
growing markets around the 
globe, especially in India and 
China.
The conference started with 
M.S. Krishnan, associate dean for 
executive programs at the Business 
School, who welcomed all the 
attendees and explained the 
idea of educating responsible 
leaders behind the conference.
“At Michigan, our mission 
is to educate leaders, who 
believe in business that can 
change the world,” Krishnan 
said. “We ask for responsible 
leaders who can create a 
positive 
impact 
wherever 
they go, whether it is profit, 
non-profit 
or 
whichever 

organization they choose, and 
whichever part of the world.”
The 
audience 
then 
welcomed Shivakumar, who 
focused his keynote address 
on 
the 
development 
and 
growth of markets around 
the globe, with an emphasis 
on consumer habits in those 
markets.
“All my life I worked with 
consumers,” 
Shivakumar 
said. “All my life I worked 
with emerging markets. And 
all that you see in the next 
30 slides are pure, personal 
experience.”
Shivakumar 
condensed 
his experiences into some 
general trends reflecting the 

development 
of 
emerging 
economies 
with 
respect 
to 
population, 
wage, 
urbanization and technology. 
He 
first 
pointed 
out 
the 
trend of having a relatively 
young population in emerging 
countries.
“Emerging markets have 
very 
young 
populations,” 
Shivakumar said. “The U.S. 
has 
the 
youngest 
among 
developed 
economies 
with 
a 
37-years 
average. 
The 
right side is the developing 
economies, 
Pakistan, 
21; 
Nigeria 18; South Africa, 25.”

As part of Ripple’s University 
Blockchain Research Initiative, the 
University of Michigan received 
a $1 million grant for education 
and research in blockchain and 
cryptocurrency — types of financial 
technology, commonly referred to 
as FinTech. Ripple is a technology 
company working in the blockchain 
payments working in the field.
Ken Weber, head of social 
impact at Ripple, said UBRI aims 
to support students and faculty 
actively engaged in the blockchain 
space. The initiative hopes to 
streamline ongoing partnerships 
with universities across the world 
and Ripple will help tailor initiatives 
to fit each school’s curriculum and 
goals.
“The 
University 
Blockchain 
Research Initiative is a program 
for partnerships with universities 
to 
advance 
understanding 
and 
innovation 
in 
blockchain, 
cryptocurrency and FinTech and 
related topics,” Weber said. “It 
is given in the form of a gift and 
universities are able to utilize that 
funding in ways that are aligned 
with students and faculty interests.”

Students, faculty respond to 
impact of ‘U’ DEI initiatives

Michigan Masons B.E.S.T award to 
charitable organization in Ann Arbor

Different complaints regard Title IX adherence, lack of community input

At the University of Michigan 
and 
around 
the 
country, 
universities are engaged in ongoing 
discussions 
about 
diversity 
programs and Title IX adherence. 
The University has repeatedly 
stressed its commitment to its 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
initiatives. But some people take 
issue with this type of initiative, 
claiming certain diversity efforts 
exclude men.
LSA 
sophomore 
Saveri 
Nandigama 
said 
themes 
of 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
have a historical place at the 
University. Nandigama, a member 
of South Asian Awareness Network 
and 
former 
Central 
Student 
Government chief of staff, said it’s 
important for the University to 
include student voices — which has 
been a problem for the University 
historically.
Nandigama specifically noted 
the three Black Action Movements 
and the Trotter Multicultural 
Center as times students had to 
make campus-wide calls for change 
from the University. She said the 
University has a good DEI presence 
on campus, but should take student 

concerns into consideration before 
students feel they must demand 
action through large-scale actions. 
“The quantity of D, E and I 
initiatives is great, but the quality 
can definitely be greatly improved 
if there was more student input in 
the programming that’s done, and 
looking at the history of diversity, 
equity 
and 
inclusion 
on 
our 
campus, I think that’s very easily 
forgotten, but it’s important to go 
back to our history,” Nandigama 
said. “It’s important to get student 
voice into these D, E and I offices to 
sort of be proactive about ensuring 
that students feel like they have a 
space on campus before they feel 

like they need to speak out 
and they need to take larger 
efforts in order to feel seen 
and heard.”
In 2016, the five-year 
DEI plan, which promised 
$85 million over five years 
and 
included 
campus 
climate-related training, the 
creation of the new Trotter 
Multicultural Center and 
new recruitment strategies, 
was unveiled. 
According 
to 
2016 
Daily reporting, the plan 
was in part a response to 
recent 
student 
activism, 
specifically 
the 
#BBUM 
movement on Twitter and 
2013 protests started by the 
Black Student Union.
The 
DEI 
plan 
made 
connections 
to 
social 
movements 
on 
campus, 
including 
Black 
Action 
Movement and debates over 
affirmative action in the last 
decade. Students protested 
the plan because they felt 
the student voice was not 
properly accounted for during 
the keynote speech at the plan’s 
launch.
The costs of DEI 
Perry has seen what he’s called 
increased “administrative bloat” 
over his 25 years in the University 
system. He pointed to position 
changes related to diversity as 
part of this issue. Ultimately, he 
said this changing administrative 
landscape and the costs associated 
with it fall on students, families 
and taxpayers.
“This is very, very costly, and 
it’s one of the reasons that college 
gets more expensive,” Perry said.

For 
Business 
freshman 
Aamisha 
Kini, 
coordinating 
class schedules and keeping up 
with assignment deadlines are 
difficult tasks. It’s stressful, 
she 
said, 
because 
many 
times the primary option for 
keeping up-to-date in classes is 
navigating pages and pages of 
online syllabi.
“No one really told me what 
Canvas was,” Kini said, “I 
wouldn’t have known that I had 
assignments due.”
This issue inspired the free 
mobile 
application 
Skoller, 
founded 
by 
Carson 
Ward, 
Logan Matthews and Jonathan 
Rankin. The app allows the 
user to download a syllabus, 
generate a grade calculator, a 
course schedule and a to-do list 
with 
notifications. 
Matthews 
said Skoller is unique from other 
grade calculators and course 
planners because it’s “student-
powered,” and doesn’t rely on 
professors or teachers to update 
information on official university 
platforms like Canvas.

On Thursday morning, 
members of the Michigan 
Masonic 
Charitable 
Foundation 
awarded 
the 
Ronald McDonald House 
Charities 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 
a $36,000 grant for their 
notable work.
The Ronald McDonald 
House 
provides 
lodging 
for the families of children 
being 
treated 
at 
C.S. 
Mott 
Children’s 
Hospital 
across the street. Mott is a 
component of the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
medical 
infrastructure.
Julaine LeDuc, director of 
development for the Ronald 
McDonald 
House, 
said 
the house aims to provide 
comfort and convenience 
to families facing a difficult 
situation.
“The mission of Ronald 
McDonald 
House 
is 
to 
provide a home away from 
home for families whose 

children are seriously ill or 
injured and are hospitalized 
at the C.S. Mott Children’s 
Hospital,” LeDuc said. “We 
provide rooms, meals, each 
bedroom has a private bath, 
and families can stay for 
as long as they need to stay 
while their child is in the 
hospital.”
The 
Masons’ 
donation 
is a part of their annual 
B.E.S.T. Grant, an acronym 
for build, enrich, strengthen 
and transform. The Masons 
award $1 million dollars 
split between seven causes 
chosen from 88 applicants. 
Executive 
Director 
Walt 
Wheeler said the Ronald 
McDonald House stood out 
in the applicant pool for its 
truly influential work.
“Really, 
the 
deciding 
factor is that we try to look 
at what’s going to have 
the most impact — what’s 
really going to change a 
person’s life or really make a 
difference in a person’s life,”

The Zell Visiting Writer 
Series welcomed esteemed 
poet Major Jackson to the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Museum of Art for a poetry 
reading 
on 
Thursday 
evening. 
The 
series 
invited 
distinguished 
writers each semester to 
present their work.
Zell 
Fellow 
Callie 
Collins, program assistant 
for the Visiting Writer 
Series, 
discussed 
the 
program’s goal of giving 
the University community 
a 
unique 
opportunity 
to hear from respected 
writers. 
“These are incredible, 
nationally 
acclaimed 
poets and fiction writers,” 
Collins said. “We hope 
that we can bring writers 
who are at the top of their 
fields and put them in front 
of both current students 
and a bigger audience from 

the community who could 
come out and hear writers 
they wouldn’t otherwise 
have the chance to hear.
She 
went 
on 
to 
discuss poetry’s unique 
potential to make social 
commentary, 
especially 
in a society rife with 
political partisanship.
“I 
think, 
especially 
right 
now, 
so 
much 
writing is attempting to 
grapple with our political 
situation and the way that 
the world is changing, and 
so dramatically,” Collins 
said. “Poetry is especially 
effective because it can 
change so quickly, and it 
can adapt so easily… It’s a 
particularly good time to 
listen to people who think 
about how to be a human.”
Jackson, 
an 
award-
winning poet, began his 
reading with a reflection 
on poetry’s function as a 
means of self-discovery. 
He then read a series 
of 
deeply 
personal 

poems 
which 
focused 
on 
broader 
themes 
of 
Black 
representation 
and the tropes of Black 
masculinity.
After 
the 
reading, 
Jackson took part in a 
question-and-answer 
session, 
during 
which 
he reflected on his own 
experience as a poet. He 
began by explaining the 
moment he discovered he 
wanted to pursue writing 
poetry professionally.
“I was writing a lot 
of 
poems 
about 
North 
Philadelphia,” 
Jackson 
said. “I showed it to my 
grandfather… He was so 
proud of that poem. I saw 
this poem exist outside 
of my little apartment, I 
saw how it existed among 
my community at that 
time. That was a feeling 
that was quite addictive, 
so much so, that I took 
myself serious, and found 
other student writers.”
Many of Jackson’s poems 
are 
location-based, 
focused 
specifically 
on 
his 
hometown, 
Philadelphia. 
Jackson 
explained that he finds 
inspiration in writing 
about 
something 
so 
deeply 
personal. 
He 
reflected on how his 
writing aims to reveal 
a more humanistic side 
to his home city.
“For me, in a lot of 
ways, 
it 
was 
about 
trying to dignify lives 
in that space, trying to 
remember the people 
I 
grew 
up 
with,” 
Jackson said. “There’s 
something 
that 
you 
probably 
shouldn’t 
bear witness to at such 
a young age, but, oddly 
enough, 
I’m 
grateful 
for 
that 
childhood 
in 
Philadelphia… 
It 
wasn’t 
a 
war-torn 
environment, 
but 
that’s 
what 
I 
am 
writing 
against 
— 
the 
perception 
that 
there was a lot of pain 
because there was a lot 

of humanity, history and 
culture that was passed 
down.”

After the event, LSA 
sophomore Joshua Jordan 
told 
The 
Daily 
how 
his 
passion 
for 
poetry 
stemmed from its being 
different from every other 
art form.
“I enjoy poetry because 
it 
isn’t 
so 
necessary,” 
Jordan said. “Every other 
art form that we have 
seems to be justified by 
some other medium — 
it’s either profitable or 
it’s popular. Poetry has 
always been weird and 
niche, and it has stayed 
that way, to some degree.”
Jackson concluded with 
a reflection on how the 
process of writing poetry 
is inherently personal and 
based on instincts.
“Every line that you 
write is a note you play, 
and it’s a note you play 
that has to feel right,” 
Jackson said. “The words 
are there, but the shape 
is not there. That’s a 
kind of restlessness that 
I think we all should 
cultivate 
inside 
of 
us. 
That restlessness is really 
dependent on how much 
you are going to lean in 
on yourself not to do easy 
things.”

LSA sophomore Alyssa McMurtry on her story “Whitmer delivers first 
State of State address”:

“I was in the press room, but from what I could tell it was electric. A lot of people, 
there were a lot of standing ovations, at one point she got everyone to stand which was 
impressive. Even though her speech was somber, you could tell everyone was upbeat and 
pretty hopeful for the future and seemed like they really wanted to get work done. It was 
definitely nerve-wracking, I was very nervous but everyone was very nice, very polite, and 
gave some really great answers, really insightful. You could feel the energy off them, that 
they were really excited about the future. It was scary but i was very happy to do it.”

Award-winning poet reflects on themes

Zell Visiting Writer Series welcomed Major Jackson for a reading at the UMMA

MADELINE MCLAUGHLIN
Daily Staff Reporter


“In addition to all the administrative 
bloat and administrative growth 
that’s been driving up the cost of 
tuition, this is now a whole new part 
of subset of the bigger picture of more 
and more administrators making 
higher and higher salaries, and then 
burdening students and their parents 
with higher and higher levels of 
student loan debt to be able to afford 
this rising tuition that’s blowing up 
not because instructional costs are 
necessarily increasing or their hiring 
full-time professors, they’re hiring 
more and more bureaucrats.”
Perry published a list of diversity 
officers at the University on his 
Twitter account. He said over 70 
positions have been added and the 
money spent would be equivalent 
to 
giving 
in-state 
full 
tuition 
scholarships to over 700 students.
In response to a Detroit News 
editorial critical of DEI spending, 
University President Mark Schlissel 
wrote in a letter to the editor over 80 
percent of the positions were created 
before 2016 and have had diversity 
duties added since their creation.
“In many cases, staff with the term 
‘diversity’ in their job descriptions 
have added these specific duties 
to jobs they already had,” Schlissel 
wrote. “Everyone benefits from 
their work.”
University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen reiterated the message 
of Schlissel’s letter in an email 
interview with The Daily. She added 
there is also a DEI Implementation 
Leads Group, which is a group 
helping 
with 
department-level 
DEI work, but these are University 
employees doing this in addition to 
their other work.
“They help carry out unit 
and department level DEI goals 
and meet on a monthly basis to 
share best practices, engage in 
professional development activities 
and receive updates, information, 
tools, templates and other resources 
from 
central 
administration,” 
Broekhuizen wrote. “Many of these 
employees are not solely dedicated 
to DEI efforts but do so in addition 
to their roles and responsibilities 
within their department.”
National 
discourse 
on 
diversity and Title IX compliance
Perry filed a complaint in May 
with the U.S. Department of 
Education’s Office for Civil Rights 
challenging 11 University programs, 
initiatives, 
organizations 
and 
scholarships. An OCR letter to Perry 
dated Jan. 24 said the department is 
opening an investigation into the 
claims.
Perry said his claims stemmed 
from males being overlooked and 
the University not taking action. 
He said the roles of employees who 
have diversity-related duties should 
be to ensure programs and policies 
work against discrimination against 
all groups equally. He specifically 
noted the case of men.
“From a legal standpoint it’s 
very clear and yet it seems like it’s 
never tolerated to discriminate 
against women or minorities, but 
discriminating 
against 
men 
is 
either overlooked or encouraged or 
even advocated,” Perry said. “That’s 
where this double-standard, I think, 
in the diversity industry, the Title 
IX enforcement and compliance 
is, so that’s where I think if they’re 
really doing their job, then they 
have to look at discrimination 
against men as a violation of Title 
IX — which it is — and they have to 
take that as seriously as they take 
discrimination against women.”
Perry is known for challenging 
a women-only lounge at Michigan 
State University in 2016. His 
complaint prompted a petition in 
favor of the lounge garnering over 
6,500 signatures and the school 
converting the lounge into a study 
space for all students. Additionally, 
he has filed complaints with OCR 
against Wayne State University, 
the University of Virginia and the 
University of Minnesota, Twin 
Cities.
However, Perry is not the only 
person vocalizing his opinions 
on diversity programs and Title 
IX policy compliance on college 
campuses. 
Margaret 
Valois, 
a 
Virginia-based 
lawyer, 
filed 
a 
complaint 
with 
OCR 
against 
Tulane University for “financial 
discrimination” against men in 
awards and internship grants. 
Ultimately, Tulane reached an 
agreement requiring administrative 
training to prevent discrimination 
in 
funding 
and 
on-campus 
opportunities in the future.
Perry 
held 
up 
the 
Tulane 
University 
agreement 
as 
an 
example of the outcome of OCR 
investigations 
into 
diversity 
programs. 
He 
said 
there 
are 
parallels between his complaints 

and those made against Tulane.
“Tulane University was just 
challenged on a bunch of similar 
programs,” Perry said. “They were 
found to be in violation of Title IX, 
so they’re now under sanctions 
from the Office for Civil Rights in 
Dallas for programs that are very 
similar to the ones that I challenged 
at the University of Michigan, and 
so they’re now under orders from 
the Office of Civil Rights to open up 
all these programs that previously 
discriminated based on gender… 
The outcome at Tulane, I think, 
should be a precedent for what 
happens at Michigan.”
Similarly, Harvard University 
has recently faced a flurry of 
lawsuits 
related 
to 
Title 
IX, 
diversity and discrimination. One 
pair of lawsuits, known unofficially 
as #StandUpToHavard, was filed by 
Greek groups and three anonymous 
students. The lawsuits claim a 
school policy barring students 
involved in single-sex finals clubs 
— a select group of fraternity-like 
student organizations recognized 
by the school — and Greek 
organizations from holding campus 
leadership positions, varsity team 
athletic captaincies and school 
endorsement 
for 
fellowships 
violates the U.S. Title IX policy 
and the Constitution, as well as the 
Massachusetts state constitution 
and Civil Rights Act.
In another case, a transgender 
woman is suing Harvard and 
one of its Office for Dispute 
Resolution investigators for alleged 
discrimination 
and 
retaliation 
against the plaintiff after she 
reported an admissions officer 
for sexual harassment. All three 
lawsuits are ongoing.
Broekhuizen 
said 
because 
Title IX decisions are made on an 
institution-by-institution 
basis, 
rulings made on programs at other 
campuses like the decision at 
Tulane University, do not influence 
University decisions.
“A ruling at Tulane University — 
which is specific to the programs/
policies at Tulane University — 
does not impact our policies and 
programming here at the University 
of Michigan,” Broekhuizen wrote. 
“The University of Michigan, as 
an equal opportunity/affirmative 
action employer, complies with all 
applicable federal and state laws 
regarding nondiscrimination and 
affirmative action. The University 
of Michigan is committed to a policy 
of equal opportunity for all persons 
and does not discriminate on the 
basis of race, color, national origin, 
age, marital status, sex, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, gender 
expression, 
disability, 
religion, 
height, weight, or veteran status in 
employment, educational programs 
and activities, and admissions.”
Student opinions, involvement
Kinesiology 
junior 
Jackson 
Schleuning, 
secretary 
of 
the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans, said he doesn’t take 
issue with the intentions of DEI, but 
feels University resources should be 
placed directly into the classroom.
“I believe the intentions are good 
behind the efforts,” Schleuning 
said. “The resources could better be 
used if those are funneled directly 
back into the classroom. What 
strengthens us as a University 
and community is being one of the 
most high-level institutions in the 
nation and I believe that comes with 
having highly funded classrooms.”
Broekhuizen 
recognizes 
any 
program 
will 
garner 
differing 
opinions 
from 
students. 
She 
referenced the first and second-
year progress reports for the five-
year plan to show the impact of the 
program on campus. As of today, 
she said 92 percent of the 2,177 
individual action items are already 
implemented or in progress.
In regards to student input, 
Broekhuizen said there are many 
avenues for students to share their 
thoughts. For instance, one 2018 
DEI Summit Week event, hosted 
by the Office of Student Life, was 
a student-designed event that gave 
students the opportunity to discuss 
possible approaches to campus 
climate-related issues, as well as 
give input on the proposed Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center 
interior 
finishes and programming.
Additionally, 
Broekhuizen 
also said many individual schools 
and departments have diversity 
committees comprised of students 
and faculty. She said all students 
are welcome to contact the Office 
of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to 
share their thoughts. Broekhuizen 
also noted a new student advisory 
planning group in the Office of 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, 
which students can join if interested.

Wheeler said. “And obviously 
the 
things 
the 
Ronald 
McDonald House does are 
just amazing.”
The 
Ronald 
McDonald 
House 
has 
undergone 
extensive 
renovations 
over the past decade. They 
launched a new program 
where volunteers push a 
hospitality cart around the 
hospital, complete with hair 
ties, phone chargers and 
whatever else families may 
need. The house has been 
expanded and re-outfitted 
from the house originally 
built in 1985, with new 
housing 
in 
the 
hospital 
just steps away from the 
Newborn 
and 
Pediatric 
Intensive 
Care 
Units 
at 
Mott.

The 
Alpha 
Delta 
Pi 
sorority pairs with Ronald 
McDonald House for their 
primary philanthropy, and 
the 
University’s 
chapter 
works 
closely 
with 
the 
Ronald McDonald House of 
Ann Arbor year after year. 
LSA junior Sarah Daly is the 
formerly philanthropy chair 
of Alpha Delta Pi. She said 
it’s important for students 
to be aware of and support 
the 
Ronald 
McDonald 
House.
“Everyone 
can 
feel 
connected because it’s so 
close to campus and its 
children are staying at the 
Mott’s Hospital which is 
right on campus right next 
to 
Markley,” 
Daly 
said. 
“Students have the ability 
to go in and cook dinner 
for the families and see 
the impact they can make 
and the impact the Ronald 

McDonald house is making 
on the families.”
Daly spent time in a 
Ronald McDonald House 
when 
she 
was 
younger 
while her cousin received 
medical care. She said the 
organization’s 
cause 
still 
has a place in the hearts of 
herself and her family.
“They 
don’t 
ask 
the 
families to pay,” Daly said. 
“That’s another thing that’s 
so special is that these 
families are able to stay 
there, feel warm, feel like 
they’re at home for free or 
for a small donation, but 
those rooms do cost a lot 
of money. That’s why they 
need people like us to help 
take care of them, volunteer 
but also donate money.”
It 
costs 
approximately 
$100 per night to house one 
family. With 44 rooms and 
those at capacity nearly all 

of the time, LeDuc said it 
becomes expensive to keep 
the house up and running. 
The 
Michigan 
Masonic 
Charitable 
Foundation’s 
grant will cover a year’s 
worth of occupancy for one 
of the rooms. 
“We receive a few very 
large 
donations 
a 
year,” 
LeDuc 
said. 
“This 
is 
certainly one of our largest 
donations, 
and 
we’re 
incredibly grateful to the 
Masons for providing this 
wonderful 
community 
grant.”
LeDuc said that donations 
like the Masons’ grant or 
Alpha 
Delta 
Pi’s 
efforts 
are 
what 
sustain 
the 
organization.
“We 
rely 
on 
the 
community and appreciate 
the community support that 
we receive,” LeDuc said.
 

The 
University 
will 
use 
the gift to create the FinTech 
Collaboratory, 
which 
will 
engage 
students 
and 
faculty 
in 
educational 
and 
research 
opportunities. The Collaboratory 
will be an interdisciplinary effort 
between the Center for Smart 
Infrastructure Finance (UM-SIF) 
at the College of Engineering, 
the Center on Finance, Law and 
Policy at the School of Public 
Policy and the FinTech initiative 
at the Ross School of Business.
UM-SIF 
Director 
Peter 
Adriaens, a professor of civil 
and environmental engineering, 
highlighted 
education, 
case 
research 
and 
applying 
blockchain knowledge to real-
world opportunities as the main 
components of the Collaboratory.
“There’s 
that 
student 
education side to help develop 
a pipeline that companies like 
Ripple can hire,” Adriaens said. 
“To new use cases, that’s really 
all about market expansion for 
opportunities for FinTech and 
blockchain. And then the third 
one is how do we translate all of 
this more into the public markets 
and public finance and public 
infrastructure systems.”
The 
financial 
technology 
space also has a social impact. 
Adriaens 
stressed 
the 
need 
to look past the algorithmic 
side 
of 
cryptocurrency 
to 
see the business needs and 
legal implications of financial 
technologies.
“It’s not because you can do 
it that you should do it, from a 
business perspective,” he said. 
“On the social side it’s again, it’s 
not because you can do it that 
you should do it. Or if you do it, 
you’re going to have to put some 
protections in place, privacy 
protections in place for people... 
It might potentially result in 
destabilization of the markets 
and that’s why we need financial 
policy. So, not just public policy 
but financial policy to be in place. 
That’s why we’re starting to look 
at students in all different sides, 
there are legal students involved 
both from the Center on Finance, 
Law and Policy but also in the 
Business School that look at the 
legalities.”

Blockchain 
and 
cryptocurrency fall under the 
broader umbrella of financial 
technology, aiming to improve 
financial 
service 
activities, 
usually through the use of 
algorithms. Originally created 
for 
Bitcoin, 
a 
blockchain 
is 
a 
growing 
linkage 
of 
“blocks” storing transactional 
information, 
which 
can 
be 
accessed by anyone and is 
stored on multiple computers 
as opposed to in one central 
location. 
Because 
of 
this, 
blockchain is seen as a more 
robust, protected way of making 
transactions. 
Cryptocurrency 
is a medium of assets using 
cryptography to secure financial 
data and transactions.
Student interest in FinTech 
has been growing rapidly and 
surged in popularity in 2017 
when cryptocurrencies rapidly 
rose in price. On Jan. 1, 2018, 
Bitcoin hit its highest price 
of 
$13,412.44. 
Engineering 
senior Andy Walner, president 
of Wolverine Blockchain, sees 
interest from students in both 
blockchain and cryptocurrency.
“We were founded at the 
beginning of last school year, 
and that was a time when 
blockchain and cryptocurrency, 
which people often think of as 
synonymous, was getting a lot 
of media coverage,” Walner said. 
“We held our first event and had 
a turnout of 500 people at Ross 
in the Robertson Auditorium, 
and we’re seeing a lot of interest 
in December.”
Business junior Rishi Prasad, 
co-founder 
of 
Wolverine 
Blockchain and president and 
founder of Michigan FinTech, 
a 
student 
organization 
that 
promotes 
education 
and 
opportunities in the field of 
financial 
technology, 
echoed 
Walner’s 
sentiments. 
He 
recalled a Michigan FinTech 
event in 2017, where Andrew 
Wu, 
assistant 
professor 
of 
technology and operations and 
finance, spoke and where the 
club saw how many students 
were interested in a FinTech 
course. The club would go on to 
develop the course, today taught 
by Wu and finance professor 
Robert Dittmar.
“That was one of our first 
events, we had 300 people come 
out to it,” Prasad said. “And 

(Wu) said, ‘If you’re interested 
in taking a FinTech course, raise 
your hand.’ And nearly every 
hand in the room went up, and 
he literally took a picture of that 
and sent it to the dean. That was 
proof right there that there’s 
insane interest in the space.”
According to Wu, meeting 
high student demand is difficult 
because 
already 
present 
resources 
like 
courses 
and 
faculty are being utilized to 
their full capacity. Resources 
from the Collaboratory and from 
Ripple would provide additional 
learning 
opportunities 
for 
students.
“We’re capacity-constrained 
by faculty, but the demand is 
there,” Wu said. “We’re going 
to launch a new MBA section 
this year. All of our action-
based learning things, as you 
can imagine these things are 
very popular. But again, the 
Collaboratory would give us a 
lot more resources to develop 
more of that, maybe getting 
more faculty involved so that 
we can better serve student 
demand. Right now essentially 
the demand is so high that we’re 
capped by what we can do.”
Weber said one goal of the 
UBRI is to grow a network of 
students and faculty who can 
lead the way in cryptocurrency 
and 
blockchain 
development 
and application.
“Part of the program is 
to 
create 
more 
connecting 
tissue 
and 
more 
synergy 
between students and faculty 
who 
are 
working 
at 
these 
different universities,” Werner 
said. “There’s a lot of cross-
pollination, it can happen in 
collaboration, 
already 
we’re 
seeing 
subjoined 
research 
happening. There are workshops 
and conferences planned for 
later this semester and later this 
year where, you know, Ripple 
partners will either be hosting, 
co-hosting or attending.”
As one of the 29 universities 
partnered 
with 
Ripple, 
the 
University serves as a “node” 
on a RippleNet blockchain. Wu 
said this will be particularly 
helpful as a hands-on approach 
for student learning.
“We’re going to have a Ripple 
validator here on campus,” Wu 
said. “That means we’re going to 
be part of the Ripple blockchain 

network, 
actually 
processing 
the Ripple transactions. As part 
of that, we’re also going to build 
what’s called stock servers for 
the students, our students, to 
get involved. So they can see the 
transactions, that’ll give them 
a better understanding of how 
this blockchain actually works. 
They can see that in real time, 
live.”
Since 
FinTech, 
cryptocurrency and blockchain 
are new topics, Wu said there 
are no textbooks and no cases 
for students to study. Instead, 
he said, students will engage 
through action-based learning.
“We already launched a bunch 
of projects which we are going 
to do more with the FinTech 
Collaboratory,” Wu said. “We’re 
going to build essentially action-
based 
learning 
projects 
for 
students to actually work in 
these FinTech companies. Be 
it Ripple, be it startups, across 
different markets. In the U.S., 
we have one here this spring in 
the U.K., we’re going to build 
new markets in China and Israel 
… just to give these guys first-
hand experience in actually 
working with the companies. 
And in doing so they can learn 
what FinTech is and how it 
works.”
Prasad 
believes 
the 
Collaboratory can help solve 
challenges on campus, including 
a lack of recruiting events for 
those interested in a FinTech 
career, as well as increasing 
student 
engagement 
and 
education across the University.
“I think it’s tremendous that 
the University is doing this, I 
think it’s definitely a step in the 
right direction,” Prasad said. 
“I’d say the blockchain space 
can definitely be crowded and 
the legitimacy of companies in 
that space can definitely, to put it 
bluntly, be called into question. 
But I’d say Ripple is definitely 
one of the industry leaders, 
one of the most legitimate 
companies in the space, with 
their leadership team, the type 
of investments they’ve attracted 
and 
the 
partnerships 
that 
they’ve garnered with some of 
the biggest financial industries 
and companies in the world. 
I think it’s great and in terms 
of research and connections it 
should help a lot.”

T

he 
University 
of 

Michigan has a rich 
and 
storied 
history 

of 
student 
activism. 
One 

vivid 
example 
is 
student 

activism against the horrors 
of South African apartheid. 
But today, students have lost 
sight of that history, instead 
now organizing against the 
only stable democracy in the 
Middle East and resorting 
to anti-Semitism to do it. 
Going 
forward, 
we 
must 

organize against hate-filled 
movements, such as Boycott, 
Divestment, 
Sanctions, 
in 

order 
to 
honor 
our 
rich 

history of fighting for what’s 
right.

In 
his 
“Letter 
from 

Birmingham Jail,” Dr. Martin 
Luther 
King, 
Jr. 
wrote, 

“Injustice 
anywhere 
is 
a 

threat to justice everywhere.” 
King wrote this letter while 
detained in the Birmingham 
City 
Jail 
for 
organizing 

nonviolent 
resistance 

against racial segregation in 
Alabama. The letter served 
as a rebuke to critics who 
spoke out against King as an 
“outsider” and derided his 
popular 
campaign 
against 

segregation in the state.

King’s 
words 
remind 

us all that it is our duty 
to stand against injustice, 
wherever it may exist. King 
so 
profoundly 
articulated 

that none of us can sit idly by 
while our fellow members of 
humankind are denied their 
God-given rights. Despite his 
life being cut short by hate, 
his words live on. Inspired 
by King, countless Americans 
have picked up his mission to 
spread the light of freedom 
wherever darkness may exist. 
Students right here at the 
University of Michigan have 
an especially storied history 
of carrying on King’s eternal 
struggle against injustice.

When confronted with the 

menace of apartheid in South 
Africa, University students 
led the movement to tear 
down such an unjust system. 
In 1977, students launched a 
divestment campaign against 
apartheid South Africa with 
the formation of the South 
Africa Liberation Committee. 
Through these organizations, 
students pressed University 
leadership 
to 
divest 
all 

corporate 
investments 
in 

South Africa and cut ties with 
any 
segregated 
academic 

institutions in South Africa. 
At first, progress was slow. 
While opposed to apartheid, 
University 
leadership 
was 

reluctant 
to 
fully 
divest 

from South Africa. However, 
students were not deterred.

A 
new 
generation 
of 

student activists kept the 
movement 
humming 
on 

campus 
throughout 
the 

1980s as the rest of the 
world woke up to the horrors 
of 
apartheid. 
Thanks 
in 

large part to the work of 
students, 
the 
University 

Board of Regents voted in 
1983 to divest 90 percent 
of 
University 
holdings 
in 

companies with ties to South 
Africa. By 1985, the board 
voted to divest a further $4.5 
million of holdings connected 
to apartheid South Africa.

Students continued their 

quest for justice with an 
intense push to bestow an 
honorary degree on Nelson 
Mandela, 
the 
imprisoned 

leader of the South African 
anti-apartheid 
movement. 

After 
weeks 
of 
intense 

demonstrations, the board 
finally voted in favor of 
awarding 
Mandela 
with 

said honorary degree. After 
his 
release 
from 
prison, 

Mandela visited Michigan in 
1990, holding a rally at Tiger 
Stadium and receiving his 
honorary degree. With two 
decades of hard work and 
determination, 
University 

students 
honored 
King’s 

legacy by doing their part in 
bringing an evil system to an 
end.

Currently, 
however, 

similar forms of activism 
are employed by students on 
campus to smear a beacon 
of freedom and democracy 
while looking the other way 
on real evil. This is painfully 
apparent in the rise of the BDS 
movement on campus. In a sea 
of Middle Eastern illiberal 
theocracies and failed states, 
Israel has developed as a 
paragon of liberal democracy. 
The 
country’s 
diverse 

population of Jews, Muslims 
and Christians live in relative 
peace, 
with 
equal 
rights 

for all. In fact, next month 
marks the 20th anniversary 
of Abdel Rahman Zuabi, the 
first Arab-Israeli Supreme 
Court Justice, taking his seat 
on the court. Arab-Israelis 
also 
contribute 
to 
Israeli 

government, 
business 
and 

academia as equal citizens.

In opposition to the facts, 

BDS supporters on campus 
have forged ahead with their 
crusade against Israel. Since 
2002, student activists tried 
and failed 10 times to pass a 
resolution in support of the 
BDS movement against Israel. 
Exemplifying the frightening 
rise 
of 
anti-Semitism 

worldwide 
as 
of 
late, 

Central Student Government 
ultimately passed a motion 
in support of BDS in 2017. 
Thankfully, the University 
Board of Regents have stood 
against this unjust effort to 

wage economic war against 
the world’s only Jewish state.

While 
speaking 
out 

against Israel, a beacon of 
freedom and a key pillar 
of 
American 
security 
in 

the 
Middle 
East, 
student 

activists 
have 
been 
mum 

on the rising tide of anti-
Semitism 
associated 
with 

their movement. Just this 
month, 
newly-elected 
U.S. 

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., 
accused supporters of Israel 
in Congress of being bought 
off with Jewish (specifically 
from AIPAC) money. While 
some came to her defense, 
her 
comments 
provoked 

significant backlash on both 
sides of the aisle. In a rare 
show of bipartisanship, both 
President Donald Trump and 
Speaker of the House Nancy 
Pelosi, D-Calif., condemned 
Omar’s 
comment. 
While 

Omar 
represents 
a 
fresh 

face for liberal Democrats, 
her ideas are anything but. 
Instead, Omar has reverted to 
age-old anti-Semitic tropes 
to make her case against 
Israel.

As a Jewish-American, 

those comments hit close to 
home for me. My loyalties 
are with one country and 
one 
country 
alone: 
the 

United States of America. 
That 
being 
said, 
I’m 
a 

strong believer in Israeli 
sovereignty 
and 
security. 

My opposition to the BDS 
movement should in no way 
be construed as opposition 
to Palestinian sovereignty 
or the Palestinian people. 
Quite 
the 
contrary. 
I 

believe 
wholeheartedly 

in 
the 
Palestinian 
right 

to 
self-determination 
and 

am a strong supporter of a 
two-state solution. Having 
said that, I oppose BDS’s 
antagonization of a liberal 
democracy that is key to 
advancing 
U.S. 
security 

interests in the region. With 
public figures such as Omar 
increasingly 
comfortable 

with calling the loyalties 
of patriotic Americans into 
question because of their 
religion, now is the time for 
action on campus.

As 
Dr. 
Martin 
Luther 

King, 
Jr. 
said, 
“Injustice 

anywhere is a threat to justice 
everywhere.” In the past, 
students at the University 
of Michigan have stood on 
the side of justice, tirelessly 
working to extend the flame 
of freedom into the next 
generation. Now, however, 
a movement built on anti-
Semitic hate has taken root 
on campus and in our country 
as a whole. University of 
Michigan 
students 
must 

again honor our legacy of 
leading 
the 
fight 
against 

hatred, no matter how long it 
takes.

JONATHAN R. MORRIS | OP-ED

Fossil fuel is not the path to carbon neutrality

T

he scientific consensus 

is 
unequivocal: 
To 

curb 
climate 
change, 

humanity 
must 
act 
with 

existential 
urgency 
or 
face 

devastating impacts. The recent 

2018 Intergovernmental Panel 

on 
Climate 
Change 
report 

recommends 
cutting 
global 

greenhouse gas emissions in half 

by 2030. Other research, like 

the alarming recent findings on 

sea level rise and Greenland’s 

rapidly 
melting 
ice 
sheet, 

implies that we need to act even 

more swiftly to avoid potentially 

catastrophic tipping points.

Fortunately, 
University 

of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel has pledged to make the 

University of Michigan carbon 

neutral. 
His 
administration 

just announced the formation 

of 
a 
committee 
to 
make 

recommendations towards this 

goal. 
Unfortunately, 
we 
are 

way behind the curve. Other 

universities 
are 
taking 
the 

challenge seriously, like Stanford 

University, which is switching to 

100 percent solar energy by 2021. 

Closer to home, our Big Ten rival 

Michigan State University has 

installed a system of solar carports 

that produce 15,000 megawatts 

of power annually, while Ohio 

State University now generates 

26 percent of campus electricity 

with wind power. Others are 

already implementing aggressive 

carbon neutrality plans, like the 

University of California system, 

which set an ambitious target of 

cutting emissions by 2025.

Disappointingly, our primary 

strategy at the University for 

confronting the climate crisis 

has been to double down on 

fossil fuel infrastructure. This 

past 
summer, 
the 
University 

finalized an $80 million plan to 

upgrade the U-M Central Power 

Plant and to expand our capacity 

to burn natural gas. According 

to 
University 
estimates, 
the 

project will improve efficiency 

and partially help us to meet our 

previous GHG reduction goals.

But 
from 
a 
climate 

standpoint, this move is deeply 

troubling. First, this decision 

ignores the emerging science that 

demonstrates that methane leaks 

from natural gas infrastructure 

are much worse than previous 

estimates and may erode the 

potential 
transitional 
benefits 

of this fuel source. Second, and 

most importantly, investing in 

yesterday’s infrastructure locks 

our university into continued 

fossil fuel reliance for decades 

to come — a move that is 

diametrically opposed to the 

rapid decarbonization timeframe 

established by the IPCC.

We can learn from others 

who have already made this 

same mistake, such as the UC 

system, which is struggling to 

meet their carbon neutrality 

goals 
because 
of 
the 
dead 

weight 
of 
their 
extensive 

natural 
gas 
infrastructure 

that 
was 
expanded 
decades 

ago. 
Fortunately, 
they 
have 

already 
done 
most 
of 
the 

research necessary to guide 

us 
away 
from 
this 
same 

quagmire, while still meeting 

campus heat and electricity 

needs. Not surprisingly, the 

first 
recommendation 
is 
to 

stop 
expanding 
natural 
gas 

infrastructure.

This is, in fact, doable at the 

University and there are many 

innovative 
examples 
around 

the world, starting in our own 

backyard with MSU and OSU — 

both of which are saving money 

to keep tuition costs down by 

switching to renewable energy. 

At the University, the experts 

that actually run our central 

power plant say that we can 

make the transition, but what 

they need are the directive 

and the resources. That means 

leadership 
from 
University 

administration, not just the 

formation of another committee.

In fact, in 2015, Schlissel’s 

previous 
Greenhouse 
Gas 

Reduction 
Committee 
made 

the recommendation that any 

upgrades to our central power 

plant should come in tandem with 

an aggressive plan to transition 

our infrastructure away from 

fossil fuels. This was four years 

ago and yet there is still no plan 

in place. Their report even admits 

that the central power plant plans 

are “... unlikely to be viewed as 

the action of a climate leader or 

to engage the campus community 

in the vision and implementation 

of GHG reduction.” And yet, 

embarrassingly, the University 

Office of Campus Sustainability 

continues to brag about this 

misguided plan, seemingly taking 

pride in our increased reliance on 

natural gas.

While we must give Schlissel 

credit for aspiring towards the 

right goal, it is crucial that we 

press the University to do it the 

right way. On that, there are two 

important perspectives. First, if 

we aspire to actually reduce the 

climate impact of our campus, we 

must have scientifically sound 

and 
transparent 
accounting. 

The only emissions metric that 

matters is the total impact of our 

actions on the atmosphere, which 

requires a holistic approach — 

incorporating methane leaks and 

all.

Second, echoing Schlissel’s 

own vision, our impact must 

be 
much 
broader 
than 
the 

individual 
footprint 
of 
our 

campus. As one of the world’s 

largest and most prestigious 

public universities, we are in a 

unique position to lead on this 

issue and to set an example to 

inspire other institutions to also 

take this challenge seriously. Our 

tremendous capacity for research 

and 
our 
ample 
resources, 

including 
the 
impressive 
$5 

billion we recently raised, can 

be mobilized to partner with 

communities and inspire climate 

solutions around the world.

In fact, other universities 

— like, you guessed it, OSU — 

have already been doing this 

by 
collaborating 
with 
local 

governments and municipalities 

to develop extensive plans for 

decarbonization, in turn making 

their efforts replicable on a 

broader scale. To do the same 

here in Michigan, we must be 

a 
good 
community 
partner 

and set an example by actually 

committing to ambitious climate 

action, not just questionable baby 

steps.

DYLAN BERGER | COLUMN

We must come back to our roots on activism

P

olitical 
commentator 

Ben Shapiro is coming 
to campus. He has been 

invited to come down to the 
University of Michigan at the 
behest 
of 
Young 
America’s 

Foundation 
and 
there 
will 

surely be fireworks at his event 
(as there tend to be at all of 
them).

I’m not going to say he should 

be disinvited, because I do not 
believe in deplatforming, but I 
will ask, what does his rhetoric 
do? Is there an expectation 
that 
the 
incoming 
circus 

will actually make anything 
better? Or is he being invited 
solely to — if you’ll pardon 
the phrase — own the libs? A 
quick look at YouTube videos 
of 
his 
previous on-campus 

experiences typically features 
the same thing — a clueless 
student who makes the mistake 
of asking a question only to get 
shot down by Shapiro talking 
faster than the speed of light. 
The videos all tend to be titled 
something to the effect of, “Ben 
Shapiro 
OWNS/DESTROYS/

OBLITERATES/etc.”

This 
certainly 
helps 

fundraising and it no doubt 
raises 
Shapiro’s 
name 

recognition, 
but 
does 
this 

convert students to a belief 
in freer markets and freer 
people? I would argue that it 
doesn’t and, if it does anything, 
it 
pushes 
students 
away 

from 
anything 
resembling 

conservatism.

There are those who say 

that the young lean left and, 
as they grow, they’ll grow into 
conservatives — but this might 
not happen.

The young people who put 

President Obama in office in 
2008 and 2012 are settling 
down and having kids — they’re 
not 
college 
students 
any 

longer. However, their liberal 
politics have stayed with them 
along with their resistance to 
voting Republican. This isn’t a 
problem solely with millennials 
— Gen Z is just as, if not more 
liberal than millennials, and I 

fail to see how large numbers 
of either of these groups will 
vote for people who have 
made militant resistance to 
gay marriage and transgender 
rights 
a 
prerequisite 
for 

involvement (one need only 
look to the 2016 Republican 
platform to see things to this 
effect and beyond).

Not all hope is lost, but much 

work must be done to regain 
the trust — and, eventually, 
the votes — of younger people, 
and 
there 
are 
promising 

starts. Shoshana Weissmann, 
digital media manager of the 
right-leaning 
think 
tank 
R 

Street Institute, has become 
a 
passionate 
advocate 
for 

occupational licensing reform 
and groups like the Association 
of Corporate Counsel have 
popped 
up 
to 
give 
the 

environmentalist capitalists a 
place to call home. If people like 
this were the face of the young 
right, it would demonstrate 
that not only are there serious 
solutions on the right but that 
they are being pursued by 
serious people as opposed to 
what there is today.

The main issue with this 

important work is that it tends 
to be outshone by charlatans 
like Charlie Kirk who came 
to campus to screech about 
capitalism in 2018. They’re 
the visible ones and the ones 
who will end up forming the 
backbone of the future of 
activist conservatism. To be 
clear, Ben Shapiro is leaps and 
bounds ahead of Charlie Kirk, 
but that would, ideally, not be 
the baseline. This is because 
when one consciously chooses 
to make Charlie Kirk the 
baseline, this lowers the bar for 
everyone else to the point that 
an infant could crawl over it. 

Conservatism can offer a 

compelling vision to young 
people — lower taxes on the 
businesses they start, a strong 
national defense to keep them 
safe and fewer regulations 
to make day-to-day life less 
onerous. 
However, 
as 
long 

as it comes with the anti-
immigrant, anti-LGBTQ and 
anti-Muslim rhetoric of U.S. 
Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, the 
anti-intellectualism of Charlie 
Kirk and the hostility to basic 
governance 
embodied 
by 

President Donald Trump, none 
of them will sign up — and you 
can’t blame them.

These problems have been 

written about before and will 
be written about again. But 
until the right decides that 
they’re done vying for the 
youth vote, nothing is going to 
change and that is a tragedy. 
Younger voters could help 
make the Republican Party 
more appealing to broader 
swathes of the electorate and 
could help divorce the GOP 
from its current dalliance 
with bigotry. It’s a bit of a 
chicken 
and 
egg 
problem, 

because 
the 
party 
won’t 

change without young voters 
— but young voters aren’t 
getting 
involved 
with 
the 

party without changes. This is 
especially evident given that 
under one-third of millennials 
and under one-third of Gen Z 
approve of President Trump. 
The more the institutional 
right ties itself to Trump, the 
less young voters will approve 
of the institutional right. This 
problem has bled down to the 
campus level and as a result, 
the on-campus iteration of 
the institutional right seems 
to have decided that given 
the choice between “owning 
the 
libs” 
and 
achieving 

meaningful policy victories, 
they would go with the former.

Those 
who 
involve 

themselves 
in 
groups 
like 

Turning Point USA and put on 
these kinds of circuses might 
do well to remember that if 
they want to see any public 
policy that they agree with 
later in their lifetimes, they’ll 
need the votes of their peers.

NEW MEDIA REVIEW

SQUARE ENIX
After working with John Decker 
for a semester, I began to realize he 
likes to read weird stuff (according to 
my roommate, he also likes to write it! 
Ooh la la). He has sung the praises of 
Anna Burns’s “Milkman” three times 
in print (and counting), wrote a full-
on piece in support of uncomfortable 
fiction and was 300 percent into 
Kristen Roupenian’s latest collection 
of squirm-worthy horror stories.
He is also on Goodreads, and 
I happened to notice that he had 
marked Olivia Laing’s “Crudo,” 
an 
aggressively 
contemporary 
experimental novel with a dried, 
crushed fly on the cover, as “want 
to read.” This was convenient for 
me, because I had been looking for a 
reason to buy the book (it’s hardcover, 
a greater investment than I usually 
squander my impulses on). A couple 
texts and transactions later, we both 
had books in our hands and updated 
statuses on our Goodreads.
As a contemporary novel, “Crudo” 
does that risky thing where it pulls 
present-day behavior into the revered 
realm of published literature. The book 
moves at the rapid speed and with 
the passive attitude of technology, so 
we decided to write our review in a 
compatible medium: email. It worked 
pretty well for “Paradise Rot,” another 
stylish and slim work of fiction 
marketed to millennials. The form 
felt right for Laing’s tweet-infested, 
Trump-obsessed prose, too.
For what it’s worth, I gave “Crudo” 
three stars and John gave it four. 
Watch us duke it out below.
— Verity

***

Verity,

I’ve just finished reading “Crudo” 
and I think there is something to 
be said about a reader’s evolving 
proximity to a book. As in, not just 
how someone quantifiably judges a 
book (for its writing style, its lovely 
intrigue), but how they interact with 
it.
I’ll say that “Crudo” began as 
something distant for me. I worked 
through the first quarter of the 
book with a slight attraction around 
Kathy’s story. But the brevity of the 
images that Laing had written meant 
that when I stopped reading, any of 
the emotional velocity I’d felt while 
reading was gone. It was like I had to 
start over with emotive involvement 
when I picked up the book again. 
I’m thinking, then, that the depth of 
the book was really meant to spark 

something just in the very act of 
reading; that is, to be struck while 
in the process of encountering the 
images Laing flashes, but not to be 
affected by them afterwards. I’m not 
sure if you felt the same, of course.
I will say, this belligerent line will 
sit with me for a while after finishing 
the book, though: “The hammer, 
smashing the crab’s back. She 
wanted to be cracked open, that was 
the thing, only on her own terms and 
within preordained limits. There 
were rules, she changed them.”
At this crab-smashing point in 
the book, I’ll say, my interaction 
with “Crudo” changed. What I 
said before still stands, but I found 
that the images started throwing 
punches a little more violently (right 
into my gut, sometimes, because 
I think I related a bit too much to 
some of Kathy’s sentiments). But 
maybe it was all just me getting 
used to the structure of the book — 

image after image with dialogue 
claustrophobically 
in 
between. 
Somewhat hoping that your feelings 
on the almost-experimental aspect 
of the book’s structure are similar.
Still absorbing.
John
P.S. Wondering what you think 
of the development of the Laing’s 
characters. Especially “husband” 
and Kathy.

***

John Decker!

You put words to “Crudo”’s 
peculiarity 
so 
effortlessly. 
“A 
reader’s evolving proximity to a 
book … ” yeah, I’d say. “Crudo” is 
low-key slippery, one of those books 
that looks digestibly edgy but ends 
up eluding you just a little more 
than you wanted it to. Flirting with 
disaster. I thought it was going to 
be a talkative high and it was more 
like a funky microdose. Which isn’t 
bad, it just wasn’t as easy as I had 
anticipated. In fact, I’d be a hypocrite 
if I said that wasn’t a good thing for a 
book to do.
But yes, I kept changing my mind 
about my relationship with “Crudo” 
chapter to chapter, exactly the way 
you’re describing. It’s much easier 
to put down than pick up. And it 
gave me an identity crisis as a reader 
because, as much as I despise this 
term, “Crudo” is my brand — pissed 

off women trying to figure out how 
to emote in the now, complete with 
art and snark and a Chris Kraus 
endorsement (“Paradise Rot” is 
also endorsed by Kraus, a funny 
little throughline I just realized). I 
usually devour that shit, but I found 
myself making excuses to not pick 
up “Crudo.” When I did, it would 
take me 5-10 pages to stop resisting 
and warm up to each chapter (my 
east coast brain says “WASTED 
INTERPRETIVE TIME”). I wish 
I had forced myself to read it all in 
one go.
Omg, I just realized that this 
warming up/cooling down inertia 
cycle I’ve been describing is the 
narrative structure we’ve been 
discussing in Joyce class the past few 
weeks. “A Portrait of the Artist as a 
Young Man” is also separated into 
five chapters, COINCIDENTALLY 
ENOUGH, each of which seems 
to frustratingly end exactly where 
it had begun. Although Stephen 
Dedalus (angsty hetero woman-
fearing 
intellectual 
whiteboi 
protag) is doing stuff — going to 
school, fucking prostitutes, almost 
becoming 
a 
priest, 
comparing 
women to birds, mansplaining 
philosophy, writing bad poetry, 
you know — he never seems to 
evolve from it. There’s dramatic 
irony to this: through pattern, 
we learn that Stephen is forever 
doomed to stagnancy. The character 
development is paralyzed, and 
every chapter starts in the same 
introspective funk, unresponsive to 
the plot that continues to strike it. 
Visually, the book is like five identical 
circles in a row. Ask Ethan for more 
about this, it’s really interesting.
Anywho, I think “Crudo” is very 
much like five identical circles in a 
row. That’s the best answer I have 
for your question about character 
development. I just got massive deja 
vu while writing that sentence and I 
can’t place it. Weird.
I mentioned this briefly in person, 
but I’m very certain that much of the 
pause “Crudo” gives me is due to 
how personally attacked I felt while 
reading it. This sort of identification 
is always such a double-edged 
sword. There’s definite relief in 
seeing something kind of knotty 
about yourself in popular art, the 
solidarity of representation, yada 
yada. But it also gives you the unique 
distance to see exactly how difficult 
those qualities can be, like the 
age-old fantasy of getting to watch 
yourself go through a day from afar 
or as an onlooker (it also makes you 
feel less special, like is my internal 
struggle that basic? Sad).

BOOKS DIALOGUE

VERITY STURM
Daily Book Review Editor

Imagine battling the forces of 
darkness in Andy’s room from 
“Toy Story” while being aided 
by Donald Duck and Goofy and 
smacking foes with a giant key 
— you don’t know what you’re 
doing, you don’t know how you 
got there, and like in all Disney 
movies, it doesn’t matter. Who 
cares? You’re the good guys. 
The creatures you’re killing 
are 
the 
bad 
guys. 
There’s 
bright 
lights 
and jolly music. That’s 
“Kingdom Hearts III” 
in a nutshell. You can 
read the rest of this 
review, but the truth is 
that Kingdom Hearts 
is best played when not 
questioning it. Better 
yet, it’s best played by 
not thinking, putting 
away all semblances of 
logic and letting your 
monkey 
instinct 
for 
stimulation take over, 
seriously. 
If you are new to the 
Kingdom Hearts series, 
and if you expect to get a 
story from your games, 
then “Kingdom Hearts 
III” will be a slog for you. That’s 
because “Kingdom Hearts III” 
(as well as the rest of the series) 
has one of the most convoluted 
plots in gaming history. As 
the concluding chapter to a 
17-year-old franchise, you are 
expected to know what feels 
like a million characters and 
all of their individual motives 
and relationships. Even worse, 
some of these characters share 
the same name or are alter-
egos of other characters. All 
you really need to know is that 
you play as “anime boy” Sora, 
whose defining feature is his 

disproportionate 
head-to-
foot size ratio. His mission is 
to travel throughout Disney’s 
most 
beloved 
corporate 
holdings, regain his powers 
and fight the big baddies.
Your 
entourage 
includes 
Donald Duck and Goofy, as 
well as any Disney character 
whose world you happen to 
be in at the time. The rest of 
the story has all the standard 
adventure tropes such as forces 
of darkness and light, super 
villains 
trying 
to 
unearth 

powerful ancient relics, and 
apprentices training to become 
grandmasters. In all honesty, 
none 
of 
it 
really 
matters 
because 
it’s 
impossible 
to 
follow anyways. Luckily for 
fans of classic Disney movies, 
Kingdom Hearts is a dream 
come 
digitally. 
Running 
alongside the likes of Woody 
from “Toy Story,” or Elsa from 
“Frozen,” is a joy. Their worlds 
are so accurate they look like 
the actual movie. However, I’d 
like to have had some of these 
characters join my entourage. 
Donald and Goofy are great 

comic relief, yet it would have 
been funny if I could have 
swapped one of them out for 
say, Captain Jack Sparrow or 
Hercules. 
Sora’s main weapon is the 
Key Blade. After successfully 
completing each world, Sora 
is awarded a new Key Blade 
specific to that Disney movie. 
In addition to more effectively 
smacking enemies, these new 
weapons have movie specific 
abilities that make combat 
feel more like whimsical fun 
rather than life or death 
violence. As Sora stacks 
ability after ability to 
his roster, the screen 
becomes a flurry of 
rainbow chaos, causing 
your brain to panic, 
but your eyes to smile. 
Even 
better 
is 
that 
Sora’s ultimate abilities 
include 
summoning 
famous 
rides 
from 
Disney 
theme 
parks. 
Destroying an entire 
mob of monsters by 
riding a glowing merry 
go round is what I’m 
talking about when I 
say it’s better to not 
question 
“Kingdom 
Hearts III.” Though the 
gameplay 
mechanics 
are amazing, my one complaint 
is the auto lock system. When 
locking 
onto 
enemies 
the 
camera’s attempt to keep Sora 
and your opponent in view 
feels choppy, which breaks 
the fluidity the action RPG 
experience.
Kingdom Hearts III is fun, 
yet it’s not rewarding to grind 
through the story unless you’re 
a long-time fan. The novelty of 
theme park ride weapons and 
visiting classic Disney locations 
is why you will come. Unless 
you didn’t have a childhood, it 
will be the reason why you stay.

‘Kingdom Hearts III’ and 
the most convoluted story

A few months ago, I asked 
my friend what she had been 
laughing at for the past 
half hour straight. Without 
explanation, she added me 
to the Facebook group and 
watched as I scrolled through 
dozens of memes. I marveled 
at the fact that I had friends 
from the U.S., Hong Kong 
and Australia in it.
For 
those 
of 
you 
who 
aren’t 
familiar 
with 
it, 
Subtle Asian Traits is a 
Facebook group that took 
the internet by storm. What 
started out as a joke for six 
Australian students erupted 
into a group with over one 
million members from all 
over the world who share 
memes about life as a first 
generation Asian immigrant.
In 
many 
ways, 
Subtle 
Asian Traits is a way for 
Asian people to unite in 
the complications they feel 
navigating 
school, 
work, 
dating and more. Your life 
can be wildly frustrating, 
inexplicably hilarious and 
tremendously confusing at 
the same time. And Subtle 

Asian Traits is here for it all.
A 
lot 
of 
people 
have 
mixed feelings about the 
group. On the one hand, it 
can 
consume 
your 
entire 
newsfeed and suck you into 
a vortex of endless memes 
and notifications. On the 
other hand, it’s a source 
of 
hilarious 
content 
that 
can make you smile on a 
depressing day or feel like 
you belong to a community.
But I think one of the 
most 
notable 
aspects 
of 
Subtle 
Asian 
Traits 
and 
its spinoffs (Subtle Curry 
Traits, Subtle Asian Pets, 
Subtle Asian Dating, the list 
goes on and on) is the diverse 
applications of its platform. 
It’s whatever you want it to 
be: A place to poll how many 
times people rinse their rice, 
a place to find a future date 
(or 
significant 
other?), 
a 
place to share your mutual 
love for boba, a place to ask 
for advice on coming out to 
your parents.
It’s 
even 
a 
place 
for 
celebrities 
like 
Hasan 
Minhaj, 
comedian 
and 
former senior correspondent 
for “The Daily Show,” to 
remind us that they struggle 
with similar issues. Minhaj’s 

ask me anything on Subtle 
Asian Traits generated the 
comment “feels like a huge 
distance 
between 
regular 
folks 
and 
celebrities 
has 
been abridged,” speaking to 
the group’s ability to bring 
people 
together 
through 
memes, videos and jokes.
And most of all, it’s a 
group for Asians to voice 
and reflect on the struggles 
of growing up with Asian 
parents and being a minority 
ethnicity 
in 
their 
home 
countries. From getting made 
fun of for mispronouncing a 
word to sharing how Asian 
parents express love for their 
children by cutting fruit for 
them, Subtle Asian Traits 
covers just about everything.
While 
many 
may 
feel 
isolated 
in 
their 
communities, this group is 
a reminder we’re not alone. 
Because 
there’s 
over 
a 
million people out there who 
can relate to us too.
Also, fun fact: For the 
longest time I thought that 
Subtle 
Curry 
Traits 
was 
about Steph Curry — not 
content for South Asians and 
Middle Easterners. Don’t ask 
why because I truly cannot 
explain what I was thinking.

with considerable care.
It’s no surprise that “Bao,” 
this year’s Pixar entry, is by far 
the most clean-cut short of the 
bunch. In typical Pixar fashion, 
“Bao” appeals to the emotions 
of its audience, though this 
time using a uniquely absurd 
approach. The film’s premise is 
bizarre: A Chinese-Canadian 
woman copes with her son’s 
abandonment 
of 
her 
by 
personifying him in the form 
of a dumpling. It’s quite funny, 
and it’s meant to be. For much of 
the film, the sadness of the story 
is hidden behind its absurdist 
and 
colorful 
presentation, 
until the reality of the mother’s 
emotional devastation comes 
to a forefront. The amount 
of emotional depth conveyed 
within the film’s eight-minute 
runtime is astounding. Check 
out “Bao” if you’re looking to 
laugh and cry all at once.
Like “Bao,” the Irish short 
“Late Afternoon” is committed 

to making an emotional impact. 
Its 
2D, 
minimalist 
design 
couldn’t be more different from 
that of “Bao,” but both shorts 
are alike in the way they explore 
the process of coming to terms 
with the past in different but 
equally poignant ways. “Late 
Afternoon” tells the story of an 
elderly woman with memory 
loss reliving the most important 
events of her life. These bursts 
of recollection are inspired 
by mementos in her house 
that are being stored away. 
The film’s bare-boned plot is 
complemented by fluid, vivid 
imagery of the woman literally 
diving back into the recesses 
of her memory. Aside from its 
supposed “twist” ending, “Late 
Afternoon” is nearly flawless. 
The film, though small in scope, 
makes a major impact, and 
serves as inspiration to live life 
to the fullest while we can still 
remember the experience.
Canada’s “Animal Behaviour” 
is without a doubt the oddball 
of the group. While the other 
shorts deal with heavy subject 
matter, 
“Animal 
Behaviour” 
is comedic gold. Like “Bao,” 
its premise is absurd. In the 
short, a group therapy session, 
led by a pit bull and consisting 
of a leech, a praying mantis, a 
pig, a cat and an ape, turns into 
chaos when the ape lets his 
anger overpower him. While 
the animation is admittedly 
cartoonish and could even be 

called ugly, it’s in concordance 
with the film’s ridiculous and 
often childish sense of humor. 
Although “Animal Behaviour” 
is unquestionably the funniest 
short that’s nominated, it’s 
still willing to get deeper. 
The 
animals 
grapple 
with 
surprisingly human issues, from 
lack of success on dating apps to 
dealing with crippling grief. It’s 
hard not to see a part of yourself 
in at least one of these animals.
Of all the films nominated, 
“Weekends” may just be the 
most 
impressive. 
The 
film 
explores the experience of being 
a child of divorce by following 
the protagonist’s journey from 
one house to another, repeating 
the journey over and over again 
for what intentionally feels like 
an eternity. By deliberately 
distinguishing the atmospheres 
of 
each 
home 
environment 
through color, light and sound, 
“Weekends” 
highlights 
just 
how confusing and disorienting 
marital separation can be from 
a child’s perspective. Because 
the protagonist is placed in 
between two entirely different 
worlds, he doesn’t fully feel at 
home in either. The ending of 
the film suggests that he will 
embark on a journey to find his 
own sense of belonging, and it is 
beautiful.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

A few weeks ago, my friends 
and I were hanging out and 
the 
conversation 
devolved 
into a wilderness survival 
scenario. We all agreed; one 
of them would survive for a 
few weeks and one would end 
up splitting from the group to 
join another. My own fate was 
unanimously decided in less 
than five minutes: As soon as 
my feet touched dirt, I would 
just cease to exist.
Although I am Michigan 
born-and-raised, the nature 
streak that many girls have 
growing up around this many 
lakes 
skipped 
me 
almost 
completely. I credit this to 
my parents, especially my 
father (who needs a hair 
dryer to survive). I have 
never 
been 
camping, 
am 
very allergic to mosquitoes 
and 
would 
probably 
light 
myself on fire if I tried to 
cook outside. Needless to say, 
I never dreamed of having 
an outdoor life. I have made 
some strides in embracing the 
natural beauty of my state, 
but it ends at a lack of indoor 
plumbing or the inability to 
plug in a microwave. Sure, 
I love the dunes, but the 
thought of returning to a 
warm shower is just as sweet 
as the sand between my toes 
in the moment. I assumed 
many girls were like this, or 
that it was at least a 50/50 
split between the population 
of young women who loved 
being 
outside 
and 
those 
who despised it. However, 
according to the men of 
Tinder, I was wrong.
The first time I downloaded 
Tinder as a freshly-minted 
student here at the University 
of Michigan, I was shocked to 
immediately find a peculiar 
species of male Ann Arborite 
running amok: the fish man. 
I didn’t know this was such 
a major demographic in the 
online dating sphere, but boy, 
was I in for a surprise. These 
men 
are 
typically 
white, 
stocky, tall and absolutely 
LOVE to fish (or at least their 
online presence would say 
so). Their names are things 
like Brent, Logan, Trenton. 
Their first profile photo is 
characteristically an image 
of them on a dock, holding 

the prize of their time on the 
water limply in one hand. 
Each time I come across one 

of these profiles, all I can ask 
myself is whether these fish 
know what they’ve gotten 
themselves into. I look into 
their dead, slimy eyes do they 
know that their demise has 
become a ploy to get some 
20-year-old laid? The fish do 
not respond, only hang in the 
photos like deflated props 
of masculinity. It is a sad, if 
confusing end for our scaly 
friends.
Beyond the fish themselves, 
the mystery of the men behind 
them has perplexed me since 
that first foray into online 
dating a year ago. They still 
come up every time I lazily 
swipe when I’m bored in 
class, or trying to fall asleep 
after watching a romcom. 
This phenomenon alone has 
cemented my suspicions that 

love is dead, but leave it to 
Netflix to change my mind, 
if only for an hour. Whatever 
the fish men’s deal is, it’s clear 
to me that I am decidedly not 
their target audience. But 
who really is? What I imagine 
is a girl dressed in all-pink 
hunting 
fatigues, 
bearing 
a hatchet in one hand and 
another fish in her second. 
Their respective fish eye each 
other, and romance is reborn. 
But that can’t be right. The 
phenomenon requires deeper 
thinking.
In my hypothetical musings 
on the fish men, I realized 
what they could truly be 
playing 
to: 
The 
primitive 
need to be taken care of. See, 
I have no interest in building 
a life out in the wilderness (or 
the suburbs, for that matter), 
but I can understand that 
many young women do. And 
what a better consolation 
for that dream than knowing 
that 
your 
Tinder 
match 
can literally provide food 
for a family? Hell, he could 
probably build you a cabin 
too. In this understanding, I 
finally came to comprehend 
the core of the fish men. They 
must believe that displaying 
their 
catch, 
however 
disgusting in theory, shows 
more than the fact that they 
are willing to sit for hours on 
top of an algae-ridden lake. 
It is more than a display of 
machismo; rather, a concrete 
example of the traditional 
male calling to build a home, 
fish and all.
Now, 
as 
previously 
established, 
this 
is 
not 
something I personally aspire 
to. I’d rather live in a shoebox 
apartment and subsist solely 
on bodega chips than deal 
with a home in the woods 
and everything that comes 
with it. However, my initial 
confusion around the fish 
men has slowly turned into 
a muted reverence for their 
cause. All they want is a nice 
blonde lady to eat their fish, to 
turn hot dogs over a campfire 
and attend country music 
festivals wearing matching 
bandanas with them. I know 
that I am not this girl. But for 
now, I’ll let the fish men live. 
Even if the fish can’t.

Bait in the online ocean

Beyond the fish 
themselves, 
the mystery 
of the men 
behind them has 
perplexed me 
since that first 
foray into online 
dating a year 
ago.

I was looking for an antidote. 
With Valentine’s Day a week 
out, I tried not to get my hopes 
up. But I was searching for 
a romance film that tasted 
better: not the syrupy spoonful 
of infeasibility, not the stale 
sensation of overused formula, 
not the acrid aftertaste of leftover 
chauvinism. I’ve only collected 
a few over the years — “Eternal 
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” 
“Blue Valentine” and “Up” come 
to mind. (Fatalistic? I call them 
frank. But I digress.)
When I encountered Paweł 
Pawlikowski’s 
“Cold 
War,” 
my hopes got 
away from me. 
Pawlikowski’s 
2015 
film 
“Ida” 
was 
an 
antidote 
of 
another 
nature that I 
desperately 
needed at the 
end of my first 
year of college. 
It came at a 
time when I 
felt ashamed 
of the Catholic 
Church to the 
point 
where 
I was on the 
verge of leaving but hesitated, 
fearful of what would be left of 
me if I abdicated that part of my 
identity. “Ida” soothed me, told 
me I could live with opposing 
forces and curate takeaways 
from both the secular and 
religious influences in my life. If 
anyone was going to convince me 
with a romance, it would be the 
man who convinced me of that.
Sadly, though, the romance in 
“Cold War” leaves much to be 
desired. The movie places it in 
mid-twentieth century Poland 
and France, between an aspiring 
singer Zula (Johanna Kulig, “The 
Innocents”) and music director 
Wiktor (Tomasz Kot, “Gods”). 
In strictly practical terms, they 
probably shouldn’t be together, 
and, by the end of the film, they 
definitely shouldn’t. That leaves 
an hour and a half to … what? 
Bide our time? What happens 
in the prodigal journey from 
point A back to point A? A host 
of 
heteronormative 
romance 
tropes, that’s what happens. 
Let’s identify some.
Exhibit 
A: 
Propelling 
the 
romance through the male gaze
The first time Zula auditions 

in front of Wiktor, his love-
struck look slices through the 
otherwise ordinary atmosphere 
of 
the 
scene, 
wonderfully 
capturing the disarming effect 
some people have on us. This 
gaze cannot become a crutch. 
It’s only charming a few times. 
It cannot support the weight of 
a budding romance, or justify 
a sharp cut into a sex-scene, or 
make us believe Wiktor loves 
Zula.
I inadvertently put a friend 
through this film, hoping it 
would convince him to see 
“Ida” (actually, it just became 
more difficult to convince him 
to watch a dark movie about a 
nun — thank you, “Cold War”). 
He 
compared 
one 
of 
the 
most egregious 
instances of this 
gaze (across a 
crowded room — 
I’m not kidding) 
to a Dos Equis 
commercial 
and 
called 
Wiktor 
“the 
most interesting 
man in Poland.” 
There 
is 
no 
better way to 
convey 
this 
unconvincing, 
contrived 
device.
Exhibit B: The 
aggressive kiss
Once Zula and Wiktor are an 
item, they spend much less of 
their time staring at each other 
and much more of it making 
out. Neither tactic should be 
used as a wholesale substitute 
for character development or 
dialogue. Yet both tactics are 
used as such.
Exhibit 
C: 
High-Impact 
Screenwriting/Low-Impact 
Reception
In other words, schmaltz. 
Lines alluding to staggering love 
(“she is the woman of my life”) 
without substance to prop up 
these words. They fall flat.
Exhibit D: Wait, so what 
happened to her husband?
Otherwise 
known 
as 
the 
romance 
writers’ 
selective 
amnesia, the main symptom of 
which includes giving the lover-
protagonists an interloping lover 
or spouse to mention to one 
another in passing. Causes vary; 
in “Cold War,” they range from 
the need to justify a character’s 
ability 
to 
leave 
communist 
Poland for France to the more 
common desire to provoke envy. 
No matter the cause, the loss of 
the romance writer’s integrity is 

the universal result. I lost track 
of the non-character casualties 
of this endemic in “Cold War.”
Exhibit E: He slaps her, and I 
guess we’re supposed to chalk it 
up to the historical period
I don’t want to brush over 
violence against women. I don’t 
want the setting to silently 
justify it. It was never justified.
The list of other tropes that 
sap the emotional impact of this 
film go on, but I want to talk 
about one of the few scenes in 
“Cold War” that made me feel 
something. Zula and Wiktor 
venture to a club. “Rock around 
the Clock” comes on and a 
drunk Zula dances her heart 
out, from partner to partner, 
even mounting a countertop 
(while Wiktor fixes her with 
a very different gaze, tinged 
with disgust). You’re probably 
supposed to feel apprehensive 
about the increasing turbulence 
of their romance. I was smiling, 
tapping my foot. The only feeling 
I got from watching this movie 
was accidental.
What I’m asking for, this 
Valentine’s Day, is that we close 
these exhibits. Until then, I hope 
you’re lucky, unlike me, and 
that you find one of those rare 
romance films that does.

A ‘Cold War’ moratorium 
on romance for your cold 
post-Valentine’s Day feels

‘M’ set to take on ACC opponents 
UNC, Louisville over weekend

When the No. 17 Michigan 
softball team takes the field 
this weekend, it will see a pair 
of unfamiliar foes on the other 
side of the diamond.
The 
Wolverines 
(3-2) 
will travel to Chapel Hill, 
N.C. to participate in their 
fourth straight ACC/Big Ten 
Challenge. This year, they’ll 
take on Louisville (3-2) and 
North Carolina (2-2), who they 
haven’t faced since 2014 and 
2016, respectively.
Since 
those 
meetings, 
each program has evolved. 
At Louisville, longtime head 
coach Sandy Pearsall retired 
in 2018 after an 18-year stint. 
Despite the loss of its icon, 
the program hasn’t lost a step 
under the tutelage of first-year 
head coach Holly Aprile, who 
compiled a 271-234 record in 
ten seasons as Pittsburgh’s 
head coach. History will be 
on the Wolverines’ side when 
the teams clash on Friday and 
Saturday, as they have won 18 
of the 21 all-time meetings.
Meanwhile, 
two 
softball 
coaching 
legends 
— 
Michigan’s 
Carol Hutchins 
and 
North 
Carolina’s 
Donna 
Papa 
— will put 71 
combined years 
of 
experience 
to 
the 
test 
when the Wolverines square 
off against the Tar Heels on 
Friday and Sunday. Hutchins 
has established the upper-
hand thus far and will look to 
improve upon her 9-1 all-time 
record against North Carolina. 
The Tar Heels received four 
votes in this week’s USA 
Today/NFCA 
Coaches 
Poll 

after last weekend’s impressive 
showing in Mexico, where they 
captured a 4-0 victory against 
No. 9 South Carolina at the 
Puerto Vallarta Challenge.
The Wolverines have posted 
a 9-3 record in the ACC/
Big Ten Challenge over the 
last three years — a stretch 
highlighted by last season’s 
thrilling triumph over Florida 
State, the eventual national 
champion. In that game, then-
freshman 
pitcher 
Meghan 
Beaubien’s 
two-hit 
shutout 
propelled Michigan to a 1-0 
victory. If the Wolverines are 
to see similar success against 
this season’s ACC opponents, 
Hutchins 
will 
need 
solid 
innings from freshman pitcher 
Alex Storako — who recorded 
a 2.33 earned run average 
while amassing 18 strikeouts 
over 15 innings in Tampa last 
weekend.
Because Beaubien faced the 
same pressure early in her 
freshman year, Storako has 
looked to her for guidance.
“(Beaubien) 
is 
a 
great 
mentor,” Storako said. “It’s so 
exciting to have her. She has 

such great poise and is someone 
that anyone would love to look 
up to. She’s really pointed me 
in the right direction at times 
and I love having her on the 
pitching staff with me.”
As the weekend goes on, 
Hutchins hopes to find a 
resolution 
to 
her 
lineup’s 
biggest question mark: first 

base. Last weekend, senior 
Alex Sobczak and sophomore 
Taylor Bump split the first 
base duties, recording seven 
and eight at-bats, respectively. 
Before last weekend, Sobczak 
— who started 22 of the 
Wolverines’ 
57 
games 
last 
season — had started 41 games 
at catcher and two at third 
base, but none at first base.
On the other hand, Bump’s 
natural positions are third 
base and shortstop, meaning 
she is accustomed to playing 
defense on the other side of 
the infield. But with junior 
Madison Uden and sophomore 
Natalia Rodriguez in the fold, 
the lineup already has a pair of 
standouts opposite first base. 
Though Hutchins has decided 
to give Bump a shot at the first 
base job, only her performance 
can dictate whether or not she 
secures a full-time job.
The ACC/Big Ten Challenge 
will live up to its name by 
posing just that — a challenge, 
at least for Hutchins’ first base 
candidates.
Despite 
roughly 
equal 
opportunity, 
neither 
player 
recorded more 
than 
two 
hits and each 
struck out at 
least twice. If 
Sobczak 
and 
Bump 
don’t 
make the most 
of 
the 
next 
few 
games, 
Hutchins could 
start turning to 
other 
options 
as soon as the end of the 
weekend.
“First base is a hitting 
position, we all know, but 
you’ve got to be able to take 
care of the defense,” Hutchins 
said. “We’ve got to find a place 
for our best hitters. And first of 
all, I’ve got to figure out who 
the best hitters are.”

Wolverines look to right penalties

Mel Pearson sat at the back of 
Yost Ice Arena after an October 
win again St. Lawrence, content 
with 
the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team’s victory.
But beyond that, he still had a 
goal in mind.
“We want to be the least 
(penalized) 
team 
in 
the 
country,” Pearson said. “ ... If 
we can do that, we continue to 
keep it three or under power 
plays 
a 
game, 
we’re going to be 
in good shape.”
But 
since 
Dec. 
30, 
the 
Wolverines 
have only had 
less than three 
penalties 
in 
a 
game 
once. 
Though 
that 
hasn’t 
always 
stopped 
Michigan 
from 
picking 
up 
wins, 
frustration 
penalties 
are an easy — and completely 
avoidable — way to tilt the 
balance of a game right into 
another team’s favor.
In the Wolverines’ 5-2 loss 
at Notre Dame on Tuesday, 
senior 
defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi 
helplessly 
watched 

a 
third-period 
shot 
from 
the blue line come to a halt 
in an empty crease, with no 
teammates there to clean it 
up. But shortly after watching 
that wasted opportunity, he got 
called for interference. Only 
a minute after that penalty 
ended, Cecconi sulked back to 
the box after hitting a Notre 
Dame player. And 36 seconds 
after Cecconi got out of the box 
for a second time, sophomore 
defenseman 
Quinn 
Hughes 
kept the seat warm with a 
slashing penalty 
of his own.
“You can get 
angry 
because 
they don’t give 
up much, and 
when they do 
give up much, 
you don’t score 
and you get a 
little 
angrier,” 
Cecconi 
said. 
“And 
it 
can 
slide out the wrong, but I felt 
like yesterday was one of the 
one times this season that it 
happened, usually we don’t 
take those.”
Frustration — and a feeling 
of unfairness — on both a micro 
and a macro-level isn’t anything 
new for the Wolverines. In 
games against Michigan State 

and 
Minnesota, 
they 
saw 
45-plus shot attempts yield to 
nothing but a loss.
And though Michigan has 
yet to replicate their 17-penalty 
weekend from Lake Superior 
State, 13 in two games against 
Minnesota recently and six 
against the Fighting Irish point 
to more than an abundance of 
necessary, commonplace fouls.
“When I mean selfish I mean 
— I don’t say that outward about 
the team, but they let their 
emotions get the best of them 
in that situation,” Pearson said. 
“When I say a selfish penalty 
I don’t mean protecting a goal 
or helping a teammate in some 
situation. It’s just a bad penalty.
“... We were playing a pretty 
good game. I think there were 
some non-calls against us on 
penalties. I think their guys 
were going down easy, we 
were playing strong, and I 
think that’s part of it. You get 
frustrated like Quinn at the end 
there. You can get slashed three 
times and they don’t call it, and 
then he says ‘OK, I’ll slash him 
back’ and they call it.”
If Michigan can tighten that 
up it may well stay alive longer 
than conventional logic might 
dictate. But if it doesn’t? It 
might find itself in a tight box 
come March. 

Different mindsets define Michigan, 
Binghamton ahead of Opening Day

Erik Bakich sees a lot of 
benefits to practicing outside 
in the wintertime. Even in 
Michigan.
“We’re trying to get as 
many 
reps 
outside 
as 
we 
possibly can,” the Michigan 
baseball 
coach 
said 
after 
another practice in 33-degree 
weather last Thursday. “So 
even on nights like tonight 
where it’s probably too cold 
to scrimmage, it’s still great 
weather to get out and do some 
team defense, get some swings, 
things like that.”
That said, the Wolverines 
will be more than happy to 
exchange Ann Arbor’s erratic, 
often-freezing 
weather 
for 
the sunny warmth of Port St. 
Lucie, Fla. when they play 
their opening series of the 
season 
against 
Binghamton 
this weekend.
Expectations are high for 
Michigan. 
The 
Wolverines 
had a promising 2018 season 
and advanced to their sixth 
straight Big Ten Conference 
tournament. On Wednesday, 
the team was selected second 
in the 2019 Big Ten Preseason 
Coaches 
Poll, 
behind 
Minnesota. 
Furthermore, 
they are the only team in the 
conference to be featured in 
every national top-25 ranking, 
coming as high as No. 17 
according to D1Baseball.com. 
This fact is by no means lost 
on the Bearcats.
“(Michigan) seems to be very 
deep in a lot of different areas,” 
said Binghamton coach Tim 
Sinicki in a phone interview. 
“And I think the country is 
recognizing that with very 
nice early season rankings for 
them. 
“We expect to see as good of 
a team as we’ve ever opened up 
with.”
Sinicki’s 
evaluation 
is 

probably 
correct. 
Michigan 
will arrive confidently in the 
Sunshine State with much of 
last 
year’s 
high-performing 
offense 
returning 
to 
the 
diamond, now with another 
year under their belts. 
“I see a group of kids who’ve 
had another birthday, who’ve 
gotten 
stronger, 
who’ve 
become more physical,” Bakich 
said. “I would like to think 
we’re capable of hitting for 
more power this year.”
This, 
paired 
with 
improvements on the mound, 
has the Wolverines poised for 
a successful opening weekend. 
But the Bearcats have made 
their own improvements in the 
offseason.
In Binghamton, Michigan 
will 
find 
a 
determined 
opponent with an appetite 
for a comeback. The Bearcats’ 
2018 season was more than 
disappointing. 
After 
back-
to-back seasons winning the 
regular 
season 
conference 
title and a No. 1 ranking in 
America East in the preseason, 
they 
posted 
a 
lackluster 
18-30-1 record and sat out the 
postseason.
“Last year we struggled 
offensively,” 
Sinicki 
said. 
“We had a great group of 
seniors who had won some 
championships in their time 

here, but for one reason or 
another we couldn’t get things 
going and we struggled to 
score runs.”
Burned by that experience, 
Binghamton 
is 
now 
approaching things with a 
different mindset.
“This year we’re hoping 
to have a bit of a different 
philosophy,” 
Sinicki 
said. 
“We’ve moved some guys and 
are looking to play a bit more 
aggressive baseball.”
Michigan 
will 
have 
to 
contend with a reinvigorated 
Bearcat defense and a deep 
pitching 
staff. 
In 
addition 
to 
reliable 
pitchers 
Nick 
Gallagher and Reid VanScoter, 
Binghamton sophomore Ben 
Anderson — who posted an 
impressive 1.60 ERA in 2018 
— will move into the starting 
rotation on Saturday.
This weekend will be the 
first-ever matchup between the 
Wolverines and the Bearcats. 
They approach their inaugural 
meeting with different states 
of mind. But with everyone 
accustomed to the bitter cold 
of the Midwest and Northeast, 
both teams will be sure to 
enjoy the Florida sunshine.
“Just like Michigan,” Sinicki 
said, “we’ve got more than our 
fair share of weather issues in 
Binghamton.”

As the Big Ten race tightens, the Wolverines keep their eyes ahead

This was supposed to be 
straightforward.
The Big Ten was supposed to 
run through the mitten this year. 
Michigan and Michigan State 
were the two highest-ranked 
teams in the conference before 
the season and the disparity 
between them and everyone 
else only seemed to grow as the 
season progressed — at the end 
of January, the Wolverines were 
20-1, the Spartans 18-3.
It was all supposed to come 
to a head on Mar. 9 in East 
Lansing in the second meeting 
between the teams. It couldn’t 
have been scripted any better: 
on the last day of the regular 
season, two juggernauts with no 
love lost between them would 
walk into the Breslin Center, and 
one would emerge as Big Ten 
champion.
Turns out, nothing’s that 
simple. Not in a conference 
where 10 of 14 teams currently 
harbor 
reasonable 
NCAA 
Tournament hopes.
For starters, other legitimate 
challengers 
have 
emerged. 
Purdue, which Michigan blasted 
by 19 in December, rattled off 
eight straight wins, including a 
defeat of Michigan State, before 
falling to Maryland on Tuesday. 
The Boilermakers and Terrapins 
sit at third and fourth, both 
within a game of the Wolverines 
and Spartans. Wisconsin and 
Iowa, at 9-5 and 8-5 respectively, 
lurk just beyond, and both teams 
have also beaten Michigan.
Meanwhile, the cannibalism 
that has pervaded the Big Ten’s 
middle and lower tiers has 
finally caught up to the top. The 
Spartans’ 
recent 
three-game 
losing streak included a home 
defeat to 11th-place Indiana 
and a loss at Illinois, which has 
won four straight after a 2-8 
conference start. Penn State, just 
2-11 in conference play, chased 
the Wolverines out of State 
College with a 75-69 win on 

Tuesday.
All of a sudden, the Michigan-
Michigan State prize fight is no 
longer a foregone conclusion.
“It’s great for our league to 
have a team who’s in the bottom 
of the league beat a team that’s 
going for the championship,” 
said Wolverines coach John 
Beilein on Tuesday. “It means 
there’s great parity.”
Beilein was as positive as one 
could be about a game in which 
his first-place team was, in the 
words of redshirt junior guard 
Charles Matthews, “punked” by 
the conference’s cellar dweller.
“It just shows who they are. 
They’re a top-100 team,” Beilein 
said of Penn State. “All you will 
make a whole lot about their Big 

Ten record, just look at their 
scores. They’re a basket or two 
away from being a team in the 
middle of our league with all 
those games they’ve played. 
We lose to a top-100 team on 
the road, it’s not the end of the 
world.”
Coachspeak or not, Beilein has 
a point — the Nittany Lions are 
ranked 347th in KenPom.com’s 
“luck” rating, factoring in the 
number of close losses they’ve 
suffered. Penn State might be 
just 9-15, but its KenPom rating 
of 58th is the highest of any team 
with less than 10 wins, by a wide 
margin. It was always capable 
of beating Michigan if enough 
swung in its favor.
Matthews, however, was far 

more critical in his evaluation.
“(No) sense of urgency, lack 
of focus right there,” he said. 
“Simple as that.”
But 
underlying 
these 
contrasting postgame sentiments 
is a point of agreement between 
coach 
and 
player. 
Beilein 
indirectly noted it when he 
extolled the Big Ten’s depth. 
Matthews was more explicit. The 
Wolverines aren’t flying above 
the conference’s pressure cooker 
anymore — they’ve been dragged 
back in, and their mentality must 
be adjusted accordingly.
“You got to respect each and 
every game,” Matthews said. 
“Lack of discipline, lack of effort, 
not having a sense of urgency. 
I tell my guys, all of our losses 

came to teams who at the time 
weren’t ranked. … Clearly (that) 
has to do something with our 
focus.”
The problems that were on 
display in Happy Valley didn’t 
start there, but the loss might 
serve a benefit as a much-
needed wake-up call. To take 
advantage of it, Michigan needs 
to learn from what went wrong 
Tuesday and, if Matthews is 
representative of anything, it has 
the sense of urgency needed to 
do so.
“I’m not gonna hang my head 
and quit before the end of the 
season,” Matthews said. “We 
gotta go out fighting, nothing to 
lose. Get my teammates to rally 
on with me. We gotta be better.”

That 
starts 
as 
soon 
as 
Saturday, when Maryland comes 
to Crisler Center with a much 
stronger team than Penn State. 
The Terrapins represent a new 
reality for the Wolverines: if they 
want to achieve their ultimate 
goals — celebrating a conference 
title in their rivals’ arena, a third 
straight Big Ten Tournament 
championship or a deep run 
in March — there’s no margin 
for error. Not in arguably the 
toughest conference in America.
The path to achieving those 
goals isn’t as straightforward 
as it once was. But on Tuesday, 
Matthews couldn’t have been 
more clear:
“Don’t get punked. It’s simple. 
Don’t get punked.”

With just under 30 seconds 
remaining in Michigan’s 67-58 
win over Indiana, Kim Barnes 
Arico pulled senior center 
Hallie Thome out of the game. 
As Thome took a seat on the 
bench, her coach approached 
her.
“Did you get it?” Barnes 
Arico asked.
“No coach, I needed one 
(more),” Thome said.
Despite 
finishing 
one 
point shy of the 2,000 point 
milestone, Thome was fine 
getting the only stat that 
mattered to her on the night: a 
fifth-straight victory.
After 
scoring 
one 
point 
against Penn State, Thome 
bounced back in a big way in 
Thursday’s win. Thome — who 
was masterful all night long 
with a 14-point, 11-rebound 
performance that also included 
three assists, two steals, and 
three blocked shots — netted 
seven points in the first half. 
Michigan, 
however, 
found 
themselves in a five-point hole 
heading into the locker room.
To try and spark a run, 
Barnes 
Arico 
started 
the 
second half with freshman Naz 

Hillmon coming in at power 
forward — pairing Thome with 
her heir and sparking a 9-0 run 
to seize the game’s momentum 
and bring the Crisler Center 
crowd to its feet.
“I think it’s a tremendous 
thing,” Thome said. “To have 
me, Hailey and Naz, three bigs, 
some guard has to guard one of 
us.”
While Thome scored just 
two points in the third quarter, 
she dominated 
on the glass and 
helped to create 
transition 
opportunities 
by forcing steals 
down low and 
registering 
a 
blocked 
shot. 
On the offensive 
end, her lone 
bucket came on 
a play that saw 
her strip a Hoosier defender 
to regain possession of a loose 
ball before banking in a tough 
layup to tie the score at 39.
In 
the 
fourth 
quarter, 
Thome came up with two of 
the team’s most important 
baskets. 
With 
just 
under 
4:30 remaining, Thome hit 
a right-handed hook shot to 
give Michigan a 56-55 lead. 

Two-and-a-half minutes later, 
Thome once again converted 
a hook shot, this time with her 
left while earning a trip to the 
line for a three-point play in 
the process. Thome’s ability to 
muscle through the contact to 
finish the tough shot reminded 
her of a certain teammate.
“I felt like Naz on that one!” 
she laughed.
As the final buzzer sounded, 
the 
Wolverines 
locked 
up 
another 
huge 
conference win 
to 
push 
their 
conference 
record to 8-6 
and, 
most 
importantly, 
improve 
their 
resume 
for 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament. 
The team’s next 
game 
will 
be 
on the road against Illinois on 
Sunday, meaning that Thome 
will be unable to secure her 
scoring 
milestone 
in 
front 
of her home fans. Thome, 
however, reiterated that she 
got exactly what she wanted:
“At the end of the day, I’m 
not worried about the points,” 
she said. “As long as we win, 
I’m a happy camper.”

Charging to victory
Michigan comes from behind to beat Indiana, 67-58, moving to 8-6 in the Big Ten and boosting NCAA Tournament hopes

With 30 seconds on the clock 
and Indiana pushing the ball, the 
Hoosiers looked poised to cut into 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s 63-58 lead. But then Nicole 
Munger stepped in. Literally.
With four fouls to her name, 
the senior guard planted her feet 
and took a charge right near the 
basket to give the Wolverines the 
ball back, effectively icing the 
game. 
“It’s 
Munger,” 
said 
junior 
guard Akienreh Johnson said. 
“Everybody else was probably 
like, ‘Wow that’s amazing.’ But she 
does that every day.”
Thanks to Munger’s hustle play 
and strong performances from 
Thome, who had a double-double 
with 14 points and 11 rebounds 
and Johnson — who stepped 
up in the absence of injured 
freshman guard Amy Dilk, going 
for 16 points and seven rebounds 
— Michigan (8-6 Big Ten, 17-9 
overall) got a come-from-behind 
67-58 victory on Thursday night 
against Indiana, its fifth-straight 
win. 
The Wolverines started off 
the game strong, jumping out 
to an 8-2 lead in the first three 
minutes, thanks in part to a 
pair of 3-pointers from Johnson 
and sophomore forward Hailey 
Brown. A few minutes later — 
following freshman forward Naz 
Hillmon’s layup, a pair of free 
throws from sophomore guard 
Deja Church and a Johnson 
jumper — Michigan extended its 
lead to 18-10.
Then things started to change. 
Quickly.
From the final 2:22 in the first 
period until nearly two minutes 
into the second quarter, the 
Wolverines failed to score. The 
Hoosiers (6-8, 17-9), meanwhile, 
put together an eight-point run 
during that same stretch to tie 
the game. Johnson finally ended 
the scoring drought for Michigan 
with a layup in the low post to go 
up, 20-18. 
But things didn’t change much 
for the Wolverines after that. 
During the final eight minutes of 

the first half, Michigan could only 
muster six points.
“We (talked) about (how) we 
kind of went away from what was 
working,” Johnson said. “So we 
had a lot of transition and we went 
away from that. I think it might 
have been a little bit of fatigue and 
a little bit of like we didn’t think 
that we could keep getting the 
shots that we were getting.” 
Indiana, 
meanwhile, 
got 
everything it wanted. Following 
the Johnson layup, the Hoosiers 
and Wolverines traded a pair of 
baskets each before Indiana went 
on its second run of the game, 
registering nine straight points 
during a four-minute run at the 
end of the second period. Thome 
rescued the Wolverines with 
an up-and-under layup with 21 
seconds remaining, cutting the 
deficit to five going into the half. 
A big reason for Michigan’s 
struggles late in the first and 
throughout the second quarter 
was turnovers. After committing 
just three turnovers in the first 
eight minutes of the game, the 
Wolverines committed another 
three in the last two minutes of 
the quarter. Then, in the second 
quarter, Michigan recorded four 
more turnovers in the first 4:20 of 
the period. The Hoosiers totaled 
12 first-half points off turnovers.
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico attributed much of the 
turnover issues to the team 
missing Dilk. 
“Amy was probably averaging 
about 35 minutes a game and 
she had the ball in her hands, 
especially under pressure,” Barnes 
Arico said. “A lot of decision 

making came through her and 
now we’re putting Deja there, 
we’re putting Akienreh there, 
putting Nicole there, (freshman 
guard) Danielle Rauch a little bit 
at times in that spot. … And now 
teams are pressuring us.” 
Coming into the second half, it 
looked like not much had changed 
for the Wolverines. After allowing 
an Indiana layup, Michigan then 
proceeded to turn it over on its 
first possession after the break. 
But, as quickly as things 
changed for the worse in the first 
half, they changed for the better in 
the second. 
Highlighted 
by 
Brown’s 
second 3-pointer of the night, the 
Wolverines put together a 7-0 run 
of their own to tie the game at 35. 
The rest of the quarter was a 
back-and-forth affair, with the two 
squads trading basket after basket. 
Then, with seconds remaining, 
Munger caught the ball in the 
corner and knocked down a three 
as time expired to give Michigan a 
51-48 lead heading into the fourth. 
In what continued to be a 
tense battle, the Hoosiers and 
Wolverines exchanged blows in 
the final period. 
With Michigan clinging to 
a 58-57 lead, Thome converted 
a spinning layup while getting 
fouled to extend the lead to four 
with just under two minutes 
remaining. 
“In the fourth quarter we 
brought a huddle in,” Thome said, 
“and it was pretty close and we 
said, ‘We’ve been here every game 
and we know what to do,’ ”
Then, the Wolverines went out 
and did it.
