MSA joins national
initiative to prevent
higher ed. cuts by
U.S. committee
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
With college students nation-
wide vocalizing their outrage,
in response to higher education
funding cuts, the Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly recently joined
the cause by endorsing an ini-
tiative to prevent future federal
funding slashes.
In an e-mail to about 2,600
students on Wednesday, MSA
President DeAndree Watson
endorsed the "Save Student
Aid" petition. The petition was
penned by the Student Aid Alli-'
ance - a national coalition of
universities promoting aid ini-
tiatives - that aims to keep
higher education affordable. The
endorsement comes less than
three weeks before the Nov. 23
deadline set by the Congressio-
nal supercommittee on deficit
reduction to pare the federal
budget by at least $1.2 trillion,
which could have an effect on

federal financialaidi
The Alliance plans fn deliver
the petition to the committee
before its deadline to demon-
strate the fight against cuts to
higher education funding.
Watson wrote in the e-mail
that the committee, also known
as the Joint Select Committee on
Deficit Reduction, may continue
to scale back and eliminate more
student aid after already cutting
$30 billion from federal student
aid programs. He wrote that
students need to express their
concerns that any rollbacks will
bring down the affordability and
accessibility of higher education.
"Our members of Congress
need to hear from us directly, so
that they understand the impor-
tance of student aid and the vital
role it plays in ensuring access
to higher education for all stu-
dents," Watson wrote.
To emphasize the importance
of supporting student aid initia-
tives, LSA junior Sean Walser,
chair of MSA's External Rela-
tions Committee, said students
should remember there are two
U.S. representatives from Michi-
gan serving on the Joint Select
Committee on Deficit Reduc-
tion - U.S. Reps. Dave Camp

during his announcement that
aired on ESPNU. "(I felt) I could

"And I know (Michigan's) on

McGary's probably right
about his ability to make an early

(R-Mich.) and Fred Upton (R-
Mich.).
Walser said he is concerned
that further cuts to federal loan
programs, coinciding with rises
in tuition at the University and
schools nationwide, would push
college out of reach for many stu-
dents.
"We've seen an increasing gap
between aid programs by the gov-
ernment and the rising costs of
tuition, and it's really becoming
very, very difficult for students
from lower-income families to
have access to higher education,"
he said. "That's terrible for the
future of our country, when not
everyone has equal rights and
equal access to education.",
The fear that lower-income
students could not afford to attend
college in the wake of imperiled
loan programs inspired MSA to
get "fully on board with this ini-
tiative," Walser said. MSA is also
coordinating a campaign to give
students postcards addressed to
state politicians and deliver them
to the politicians' offices.
While he said he hopes the
measures will draw the commit-
tee's attention, Walser blamed
neither Republicans nor Demo-
crats for the decision to cut fed-
eral loan programs. Instead, he
said past cutbacks and the pros-
pect of future slashes reflected
a lack of concern for higher edu-
cation funding throughout Con-
gress.
"It's just a lack of priority on
education," Walser said.
Past cuts to federal student
aid programs include the elimi-

nation of year-round Pell Grants
and the termination of various
state grants. As part of the federal
deficit deal in August that averted
the government's default on its
debt, in-school interest subsidies
- which suspend the payment of
interest on student loans until six
months after graduation - were
eliminated for graduate and pro-
fessional students.
College officials and student
advocacy groups nationwide are
concerned that upcoming cuts
by the supercommittee could
lead to further rollbacks of the
Pell Grant program, according to
Tony Pals, director of communi-
cations for the National Associa-
tion of Independent Colleges and
Universities - one of 75 groups
and institutions that make up the
Student Aid Alliance.
Pals said the effect of further
cuts to the Pell Grant program
would be severe.
I "What happened in August
had a real impact on the ability
of students to afford their higher
education," he said. "And if addi-
tional cuts are made to the Pell
Grants, it could have a devastat-
ing impact."
He added that he was encour-
aged by the popularity of the
petition, which has about 45,000
electronic signatures as of last
night. In response to the wide-
spread support, Pals said the Alli-
ance raised its target to 100,000
signees.
"The response to the statement
has already exceeded our expec-
tations, and it speaks volumes
about just how important our stu-
dent aid programs are," he said.
Despite the success of the
petition, Pal said he still wor-
ries about the supercommittee's

upcoming decioion's:
The amount of the cuts is not
yet known, but one clue could
be the House and Senate plans,
according to Mark Eantrow-
itz, foundertand publisher of the
financial aid information website
finaid.org.
Kantrowitz said the Senate
plan proposes the elimination of
the in-school interest subsidy for
undergraduate students, while
the House bill would cut eligi-
bility for the Pell Grant from 18
semesters to 12 and lower the
maximum annual income to
receive a Pell Grant from $31,000
to $15,000.
Whether the supercommit-
tee's resolutions will more closely
resemble the House or the Sen-
ate bill is hard to tell, Kantrowitz
said. Either way, he said cutting
student loan programs without
severe repercussions would be
nearly impossible.
"It'll be very hard for them to
cut without cutting significant
needs," Kantrowitz said. "This
isn't just getting rid of fraud and
waste and then improving effi-
ciency. This is cutting many areas
where there is a definite need for
the funding."
The underlying issue, Kan-
trowitz said, is that higher educa-
tion funding is not as important
as it should be to the federal gov-
ernment.
"Post-secondary education and
student financial aid aren't even
in the top 10 in terms of govern-
ment priorities," he said. ""We
are entering a decade of severe
declines in college affordability,
and increasingly more and more
low-income students are going to
be priced out of the cost of a col-
lege education."

Environmentalists
oppose proposed

Environmentalists tried to rally
oppositionyesterdayto aproposed
national policy for cleansing ship

would pre-empt stronger state
and federal rules.
The U.S. House was expected

Utah man stages
deportation to
avoid jail time
A Utah man hatched a cre-
ative scheme to avoid going to
prison on a drug charge: He lied
to authorities and said he was an
illegal immigrant so he could get
deported to Mexico and evade
time behind bars.
The jig was up, however, when
27-year-old Jaime Alvarado
returned to the U.S. using his
passport and was arrested again
by Salt Lake City police.
The tactic exploited a system in
which law enforcement officials
sometimes prefer deporting ille-
gal immigrant offenders instead
of adding to an already overloaded
prison system.
At thetine of his initial arrest,
Alvarado claimed he was Saul
Quiroz and had emigrated from
Mexico illegally. He is actually an
American citizen.

Obama talks with

His political fortunes and his
nation's economy at risk, Presi-

implored European leaders to
swiftly work out a eurozone res-

fallout at home if they fail.
Obama, at the French Riviera
for a summit of the Group of 20
leading industrialized and devel-
oping economies, pledged to be a
partner in helpingthe Europeans
cope with the economic emer-
gency. But his aides insisted that
Europe's problem, brought on by

the threat of a Greek default, was
one it had to fix.
Taking his jobs-first message
abroad, Obama said the goal
was getting people back to work.
"That means," Obama said,
"we're going to have to resolve
the situation here in Europe."

MCGARY
From Page 1
in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily. "He's a good athlete,
plays very hard down low, scores
with his back to the basket or
facing the rim. One of the most
impressive things for a center, he
can handle the ball and face up a
taller, slower player.
"He can really create his own
shot."
For the .Michigan program,
landing McGary is nothing short
of a coup. He's the highest-rated
recruit to commit to the Wol-
verines since LaVell Blanchard
in 1999 and could be the most
dynamic Michigan player since
Detroit native Chris Webber -
part of the famed Fab 5 - roamed
the Crisler Arena court 20 years
ago.
It's a sign, too, that concerns
about Michigan coach John
Beilein's recruiting competence
might be overblown. Some have
criticized him for an inability to
pull in star recruits in the past.
McGary adds to an already
strong 2012 class, joining AAU
teammate Glenn Robinson III
and Canadian wing Nick Staus-
kas. ESPN.com now ranks Michi-
gan fifth in its 2012 recruiting
rankings, after not being in the
top 25 before McGary commit-
ted. The Wolverines also already
have four commits for 2013.
It's also a mark of status, as elite
national recruits typically just
consider the traditional basketball
powers. Having McGary might
not help land any future recruits,
since they wouldn't likely get to
play with the post man - he's
widely considered a one-and-done
player. Still, McGary's decision
indicates that Michigan is a pro-
gram on the rise, and one that can
battle with the elites - one that
recruits would want to consider.
"Winning on the court is
what gets recruits, and if Mitch
McGary helps you get victories,
that's going to help you recruit,"
Snow said. "That's the bottom

line.... He's going to help Michi-
gan win games, and good pro-
grams that win games get good
recruits."
McGary initially attended
Chesterton HighSchool, the alma
mater of current senior guard
Zack Novak. Though McGary
was a freshman at Chesterton
when Novak was a senior there,
they rarely played together -
McGary was on JV and only
occasionally played varsity.
After two solid years on varsi-
ty, McGary transferred to Brew-
ster Academy - a prep school in
Wolfeboro, NH. known for its
basketball prowess - to repeat
his junior year. McGary, who
suffers from attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, was hav-
ing maturity and grade issues at
Chesterton. His parents thought
the discipline of Brewster would
be good for him.
"I think he just took a bit more
(time to mature),"said Chesterton
coach Tom Peller. "Sometimes
these taller kids aren't as mature,
and he just needed another year
for maturity, so I think it was a
smart move for him to go to the
Academy.
"(Now) you can see he's
matured a lot, just by talking to
him."
A lot of the credit for McGary's
commitment should go to Michi-
gan assistant coach Bacari Alex-
ander, who Snow said did a "hell
of a job" recruiting him. It also
didn't hurt that McGary's AAU
coach, Wayne Brumm, was a
big advocate for Beilein and the
Michigan program.
Still, the decision was ulti-
mately McGary's to make.
"His main factor is commit-
ting to a coach that he believes
can bring the best out of him,"
Brumm said on Monday. "Some-
body that he can trust, and (a)
program where he really gets
along with the guys, where he
sees himself going to a campus
that he (can say), 'Hey, I really feel
comfortable here."'
In the end, Michigan was that
program.

The scope of marriage shouldn't be constrained
nly six states in the United States currently allow members
of the LGBTQ community to get married. A common argu-
ment against legalizing this policy across the country is
the sanctity of the traditional institution of marriage. But this argu-
ment is flawed. Laws prohibiting same-sex marriage, like the Federal
Defense of Marriage Act and certain state statutes and amendments,
should be eliminated.

Open up to open housing

ost University students
would agree that their
housing experience has
a significant
impact on their
day-to-day life.
A typical student
lives in a residen-
tial community
for at least one
year. I can say
that though my
freshman year NORA
roommate and STEPHENS
I were not best
friends, I always
felt comfortable with my living situ-
ation in Couzens Residence Hall. I
vividly remember looking over the
housing options during the summer
before my freshman year and choos-
ing to live in a co-ed dormitory. But
one thing I do not remember is con-
sciously thinking about my gender
when signing up for my housing. As
someone who identifies asa woman,
I never questioned my decision to
live in a room with another woman.
But for some, this decision is not as
easy. University Housing accom-
modates men who want to room
with men and women who want to
room with women, which leaves
out individuals who are gender
non-conforming - a term for indi-
viduals whose gender expression is
different from societal expectations
related to gender - or students who
would feel more comfortable living
with someone of a different gender
than themselves.
Until 2008, if students identified
as transgender and had undergone
sex reassignment surgery, their
only option was to live in a single
apartment in Northwood on North
Campus, which is typically filled
with graduate students. Last year,
the Open Housing Initiative worked
with administrators to expand the
options available to include all gen-
der non-conforming students. Cur-

rently, students can request - on a
case-by-case basis - a gender-neu-
tral suite if they already have room-
mates in mind. This year, about a
dozen individuals chose this option
and are living in various residence
halls across Central Campus. This
expansion demonstrates that the
University is willing to support stu-
dents who do not feel comfortable
living within the traditional resi-
dence hall experience.
However, this isn't good enough.
As a member of the Open Housing
Initiative , I have been working to
put a gender-neutral option on the
Housing application. We feel that
even though accommodations can
be made, they are limited. Students
currently only have the option to
live in a suite and are therefore
required to have multiple room-
mates. This is unlikely to be feasible
for a freshman or incoming transfer
student who may not know other
students on campus, nor does it
allow students to live with just one
other person.
Across campus, residence halls
have been renovated, which has
created more gender-neutral bath-
rooms. The space is there, so why
isn't the option on the Housing
form? All we need is a "yes" from the
administration.
We need student support from
different corners of campus to
rally for student rights - includ-
ing people like myself who are not
directly affected by the policy, but
think it's a student's right to live in
a comfortable and safe environment.
Additionally, all students should
have easy access to all their possible
housing options before entering the
University.
I can't see why anyone would
disapprove of these additions to the
gender-neutral housing policy. One
main concern is that heterosexual
couples would abuse the option and
choose to live together. However,

the research file of genderblind.org
illustrates that other college cam-
puses.with gender-neutral options
have not faced the issue of couples
wanting to live together. This mind-
set also ignores the fact that under
the traditional housing policy,
gay and lesbian couples could live
together in the dorms. Another fear
is that students will unwillingly or
unknowingly be placed into gender-
neutral rooms. only students who
explicitly request gender-neutral
housing will be given gender-neu-
tral rooms - adding this option will
not change traditional housingroom
assignments.
Students deserve
a comfortable
living situation.
However, we believe fully imple-
menting open housing will affect
every student on this campus. We
all benefit when our community is
inclusive. Let's work together to
support each others rights to choose
who we want to live with and ensure
that we all feel comfortable in our
housingsituation.
Have something to say about the
Open Housing Initiative? Want to
help? Come to the Open Housing
Initiative Town Hall Meeting from
8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Monday Nov.
7th in the 3rd Koesseler Room of the
League. Hope to see you there.

The divorce rate for heterosexual couples is
more than 50 percent, and it seems many mar-
riages take credence from the "traditional"
debate. With the widely publicized announce-
ment that celebrity Kim Kardashian ended
her marriage after only 72 days, it's difficult to
argue that same-sex couples would disgrace
the sanctity of marriage when heterosexual
couples do that on their own.
On Monday, The New York Times reported
that Kardashian filed for divorce from NBA
player Kris Humphries. The couple earned
more than $17.5 million in television and
magazine appearances during their 10-week-
long marriage. Though Kardashian denies the
marriage was planned for her to make money
or gain publicity, many people are hesitant to
believe she's telling the truth.
Obviously, the forthcoming divorce of Kar-
dashian and Humphries is a highly publicized
example of an unconventional marriage. Dur-
ing his visit to campus on Monday, House
Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) was
questioned about his views on gay marriage.
In response, Cantor cited his "traditional val-
ues," which has become the vague, politically
correct answer conservatives use to respond
to this question.
Historically, the United States has had one
of the highest divorce rates in the world. If
politicians have a duty to defend the institu-
tion of marriage, shouldn't they target cou-
ples filing for divorce by providing marriage
counseling? Or shouldn't they pursue poli-
cies to ensure engaged couples aren't going to
get divorced? These precautions would likely
lower the divorce rate and protect marriage.

Instead, politicians focus on banning
LGBTQ citizens from engaging in an inherent
right with social and financial benefits. Until
the 1967 Supreme Court decision in Loving v.
Virginia abolished the practice, several states
had racial restrictions on marriage. To many
politicians of the time, interracial marriage
didn't fall under the umbrella of "traditional
marriage" either.
Today, any race-based marriage constraint
would be promptly dismissed as racism. The
same logic should apply to same-sex marriage.
Arguments like Cantor's should be dismissed
as homophobic and hostile toward millions of
Americans.
Pentagon officials showed broad support
for the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell," which
was enacted last month and allows gays to
serve openly in the military. In July, New
York became the most recent state to legalize
same-sex marriage. The Obama administra-
tion ended its legal defense of the Defense
of Marriage Act which defines marriage as a
union between a man and woman. The coun-
try is on a progressive track, and the admin-
istration needs to move more swiftlyn-that
direction.
Opponents of gay marriage and the-politi-
cians who support their arguments should be
consistently challenged to define their notion
of "traditional values." Using the term as an
end-all answer to their opposition is unac-
ceptable and ignores important arguments.
The Obama administration and state legisla-
tors should accept marriage as an institution
between two consenting adults regardless of
gender or sexual orientation.

SARAH SKA LUBA I
Savor the siesta

Friendly faces, laughing, glasses clanking
and lively chatting. This is how more than
a few nights were spent on the cobblestone
streets in Salamanca during my six-week stay
in Spain this past summer. These festivities
did not last for one or two hours as they would
have in the United States, but in fact took up
a hefty four hours of our night. If Spain had
a motto, it would be "take things slow, and
enjoy all the pleasures of life." Granted, there
are a few exceptions to this lifestyle, but for
the most part it is a notorious norm of Span-
ish culture. The people of Spain know how
to truly enjoy life's greatest pleasures: talk-
ing with friends, drinking cheap wine and
eating good food. Whether it's time for tapas
or lunch, the Spanish custom is to dine with
close friends and family, while catching upon
recent events and stories.
Coming from the States, it was a huge shock
when I first arrived in Salamanca, Spain and
witnessed this laid-back, slow-moving life-
style. Growing up on the East Coast, I was
especially used to the hustle and bustle, fast-
paced life of your average American student. In
high school, it seemed I barely had enough time
to sleep, nevertheless eat, get my work done on
time, study for exams and go to sports practice
every day. This way of life has not changed
since coming to college. The fast-paced Ameri-
can lifestylethat so many of us take for granted
is in actuality an extremely demanding way of
life that the U.S. has learned to run on.
When was the last time you felt completely
comfortable taking a two-hour nap in the mid-
dle of the day or spending a solid four hours
catching up with friends and ordering appetiz-
ers at local bars? The Spanish understand the
importance of having a four-hour break in the
middle of the day to eat lunch with your family
and take a short nap. During this time, which
is known as the siesta, shops and restaurants
close as storekeepers run home to see their
family and take some time off to relax.
But here in the U.S., we've learned that in

order to live a productive life, napping and
relaxation is exclusively reserved for vacations
and breaks. In reality, taking a few hours each
afternoon to unwind and catch up with fam-
ily would be exactly what we need to power
through the rest of the day. It is this concept
of a perfect balance between work and leisure
that makes the Spanish lifestyle an ideal way of
living for all of us.
Contrary to popular belief here on campus,
double shot espressos and energy drinks will
never be an acceptable substitution for sleep.
We have learned to run on caffeine and daily
coffee trips to help us stay awake through gru-
eling late night homework sessions and study-
ing at the UGLi. We've trained our bodies to
sleep less in order to pound out countless hours
of work and prepare for dreaded exams. Yet
in the end, no matter how much caffeine we
pour down our throats, we will never be able to
make up for the many hours of lost rest.
It is up to us, as students here at the Univer-
sity, to realize thattaking a few hoursout of our
busy day will not kill us. Taking time to catch
up with friends, share stories, take a nap and
relax our minds is exactly what we need to live a
healthy, balanced life. We have to start taking a
little bit of time away from our hectic lives here
on campus to reflect on what's really important
to us We've all heard countless times that "col-
lege is going to be the best experience of your
life," so isn't it time we actually adopt this idea
and start enjoying all of life's pleasures?
Yes, we don't live in Europe, and can't actu-
ally spend four hours in the middle of the after-
noon each day eating and napping when we
have classes to attend, exams to study for and
work to do. But we can definitely put aside a bit
of time to catch up with friends, let our minds
rest and relax our over-worked bodies. A mini-
siesta is exactly what students here need to
escape the hectic, demanding lifestyle that we
have been all too quick to adopt.
Sarah Skaluba is an LSA sophomore.

The University is public. But
I mean to say more than
that some of the Univer-
sity's funding is
fromethe gov-
ernment. And
it's more than
just the Uni-
versity's pride
in its private-
like standard
of excellence, LIBBY
which allows ASHTON
it to compete
aggressively
with private schools whose students
loudly profess that we'll be pumping
their gas someday.
The way I've understood the Uni-
versity's public-ness is not in terms
of its in-state tuition (I'm not from
Michigan) or its lusted-after Foot-
ball Saturday pandemonium (despite
my last column, I don't actually care
about football) Instead, I conceptu-
alize our public character as being
one of commitment to the people.
And it's a character that will remain
long after the state pulls its last dol-
lar from our endowment.
We are, by definition, of the peo-
ple. So how, in practice, are we to be
for the people? We're for the people
in that we maintain a large demo-
graphic of students from Michigan.
We're for the people in that we pro-
tect the access to opportunity for
students who wouldn't otherwise be
able to afford tuition. We're for the
people in that we fiercely pursue a
diverse community, even when the
judicial system hasn't quite figured
out how they'd like us to fashion our
pursuit.
As an abstraction from our finan-
cial structure and admissions poli-
cies, we're public because we're
committed to the public good. In
an academic context, that commit-
ment shows itself in the breadth and
depth of the liberal arts education
many of us have been able to attain
here. Relative to the academic expe-
riences of my friends who are spread
out among several private colleges

and universities around the country,
my professors seem anxious to root
the theoretical discussions of justice
and good in the tangible realities
outside our classroom walls.
But the most palpable commit-
ment to the good of the people has
been by way of the University com-
munity's justice work. If you were
to identify with any disadvantaged
group or if you were to feel espe-
cially engaged in the advocacy for
one disadvantaged group, there's
an institution on campus that will
support you. Growing Allies, Expect
Respect, the Spectrum Center - to
name a few - are positioned to pro-
mote equality and unity at the Uni-
versity.
An innumerable amount of stu-
dent organizations declare their
fight for justice in one social arena or
another and new initiatives develop
all the time. Students who haven't
yet been moved to think about how
to tackle the inequalities that per-
sist today have an incentive togain
exposure to students who have.
Classes like Project Community,
Project Outreach and Intergroup
Relations accredit service work and
social investigation. Rather than
simply relying on students to vol-
unteer when they're not sitting in
class, the University has essentially
knocked down its classroom walls
by partnering service with learning.
And the classic social justice
schools and departments aren't the
only University actors who are pro-
moting social consciousness and
action among- students. The Ross
School of Business has its own mode
of incentivizing business designs
to promote the public good. Busi-
ness Prof. Michael Gordon's course
"Solving Societal Problems Through
Enterprise and Innovation" chal-
lenges students to view "the world's
toughest problems (as) opportu-
nities for for-profit companies,
non-profits and other enterprises,"
according to the course description.
So every facet of the University is,
at least to some extent, commonly

committed to the good of the public.
But I would argue that, relative to
the amount of money, human capi-
tal and influence the University has,
its social ventures aren't enough in
number or in reach. Though stu-
dents with even a small interest in
learning more about avenues for
social change have many options,
the institutional commitment to
creating socially conscious and
active citizens isn't active enough.
Much of the change work on cam-
pus is because of a few incredibly
hardworking and dedicated people.
Without them, the University may
not display the admirable charac-
ter of a public university that I just
delineated.
'U' should
promote social
consciousness.
Departments should be required
to incorporate an aspect of the Uni-
versity's commitment to the public
good in their courses for concen-
tration. Institutions like Dr. John
Burkhardt's National Forum on
Higher Education and the Public
Good should receive additional
funding with the expressed pur-
pose of fostering their ideals and
facilitating action projects and
ideas among undergraduate stu-
dents. And programs like Project
Community and Intergroup Rela-
tions should be expanded to other
departments in an effort to reach
more students.
I don't suggest this strength-
ened commitment because we can
and because it's the right thing to
do - though we can and it is - but
because it's essential to what we are
as a leading public university.

TV REVIEW
'Boss' loses touch with reality

one of these finely dressed gen-
tlemen standing up to exclaim:
"To be, or not to be: That is the
question."
Today, tomorrow and Sunday,
the Rude Mechanicals will set
a similar scene in their produc-
tion of Shakespeare's "Hamlet."
Director Emily Lyon, a junior in
the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance, set out to answer Ham-
let's famous question as she took
on the daunting task of stag-
ing one of literature's most well
known and difficult plays.
" 'Hamlet' is a huge under-
taking," Lyon said. "I started
off with saying, 'Hey, I know it's

"Hamlet" and people are going
to have expectations, but we're
going to do our own thing.' Our
play is what we decide to do with
it."
Lyon's decision was to set the
classic Shakespeare story in the
1960s - creating a "Mad Men"-
inspired show, complete with
men in suits and women in cock-
tail dresses.
"I feel like doublets and hose
and men in tights, it makes
people either confused or put
off," Lyon said. "But to me it's
such a living document, such an
alive play. Why not make it more
interesting and have the audi-
ence excited?"
Kris Reilly, a School of MT&D
senior, stars as the foreboding
and sulky Hamlet. Reilly said
the process of fitting Hamlet
into the life and style of the '60s
was easier than expected.
"You'll notice throughout the
show that the '60s are an era that
men were expected to be hyper-
masculine," Reilly said.,"You're
coming out of a period where the
U.S. wasvery-dominant, so the
men had to be very dominant.
And in 'Hamlet,' there are a lot
of lines and other little things
that hinge on masculinity, and it
fits very well."
Also suited to the "Mad Men"
era is the idea of silence and
secrecy - a general sense of the
clandestine that translates well
to a '60s-era production. As in
"Mad Men," "Hamlet" is full of

covert expeditions, sneaky con-
versations and undisclosed plot-
ting, with each character having
a distinct public face shown to
the world and a darker, deeper
private life rarely on display.
Along with well-dressed men
dragging swords through their
apartments while contemplat-
ing their lives, Reilly said the
excitement of the play is found
in the act of telling the tale. No
matter the setting, the plot or
who's speaking, sharing the
story is what entices and invites
people to sit through a long per-
formance.
"Theater is about sittingdown
and experiencing something
that's unstructured," Reilly said.
"It's open time, and that's the
mentality you need."
Though "Hamlet" is not a
short, comedic or light play, the
script, cast and plot are all richly
devised to provide the audience
with the mission of any theater
performance: entertainment.
"Everyone is so rushed today
- it's all 30-second news clips
and truncated articles online,"
Reilly said. "We're so info-sat-
urated that we often lose the

A' Grimm' outlook

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com
Sea and Cake in Detroit

NBC fairy-tale
vehicle doesn't
spell out magic
By BRIANNE JOHNSON

Attention all mythical crea-
tures, wandering children and
aspiring Disney princesses:
The Brothers
Grimm have
returned - this **

long-stand- d 9
ing question, Fridays at 9p.m.
"Who's afraid N
of the big, bad
wolf?" is finally answered in this
twist on the classic, morbid tales
written about 200 years ago.
Abandoning the whimsicality
and lightheartedness of past re-
interpretations, NBC's "Grimm"
is a cold clash between suburban
reality and fantasy, leaving little
magic in its wake.
Once upon a time, there lived
homicide detective Nick Bur-
khardt (Dave Giuntoli, "Turn
the Beat Around"). Nick can see
things. Ghoulish things. Hairy
things. Things with shoddy spe-
cial-effects makeup. Revealed
to be one of the last in a line of
Grimms, Nick inherited the abil-
ity to see through the creatures'
human pretenses. When his aunt,
a fellow Grimm, falls into a coma,
Nick is forced into the family
business: protecting the commu-
nity from the likes of classic sto-
rybook bad guys.
Family secrets! Ominous
nightmares! Marilyn Manson!
Wait - Marilyn Manson? Yes,
that was Manson himself croon-
ing his rendition of Eurythmics'
eerie "Sweet Dreams (Are Made
of This)." To any indulgent fan of
mystery and suspense, this com-
bination of elements may sound
like the formula for a cliff-hang-

NBC

ing success.
But the fantasy falls flat.
"Grimm" is far more cop drama
than it is fairytale, placingclassic
characters like Little Red Riding
Hood and the Big Bad Wolf in the
underwhelming suburbs of Port-
land, Ore. Weaving beloved tales
into a modern setting, "Grimm"
had the potential to be fantasti-
cal and intriguing, but the result
is humdrum at best.
Nick is impulsive but boring as
a one-note detective preoccupied
with the yet-to-be-solved mys-
tery, and Giuntoli's stale acting
does nothing to express his char-
acter's emotional depth. Nick's
hasty tendencies are grounded
by fellow detective and sidekick,
Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby,
"Lincoln Heights"), whose pres-
ence is no more lively than his
counterpart's.
The only magic to be found
resides in those of a less-human
nature. Accused by Nick of kid-
napping and murder, Eddie Mon-
roe (Silas Weir Mitchell, "The
Whole Ten Yards") is a reformed
Big Bad Wolf whose awe at

the existence of the infamous
Grimms nearly equals Nick's
shock at the reality of Monroe's
species. Despite minimal screen
time, Eddie's wry demeanor and
tongue-in-cheek attitude are
a welcome kick to the show's
lethargic pace.
The portrayal in "Grimm" of
the true murderer and Big Bad
Wolf himself is a fresh take on the
traditionally cross-dressing mutt.
As a potpie-baking, sweater-
wearing postman with a love for
needlepoint, the Wolf is deceit-
fully wholesome. His soft-spoken
persona is often far more menac-
ing than any beastly growl.
The moral of the story? There's
a reason cautiontape and the puls-
ing reds and blues of surrounding
police cars don't often crop up
in the likes of "Snow White" or
"Hansel and Gretel." Readers pre-
fer their villains to melt away in a
puff of smoke, not to be carried off
in handcuffs. The Brothers' tales
are recognized for their darkness
and violence, free of interference
from the law. NBC's "Grimm" is
just not one for the storybooks.

The Sea and Cake will perform

Title track "The Moonlight
Butterfly" is an example of The
Sea and Cake's various interests.
It starts small but grows to fully
submerge the listener in four
minutes of broadening electronic
experimentation.
"Basically, that was (drum-
mer) John McEntire's song, in
the guise of The Sea and Cake,"
Prekop said.
Until this album, the band-
mates' individual musical ele-
ments were just subtly present,
but now they are being thrust
into the limelight, Prekop said.
"It reflects our broad interests,

The Sea and Cake still main-
tains a cohesive identity that
intends to be exploratory. The
song "Inn Keeping" demonstrates
how the band integrates it into the
multifaceted, multilayered timbre
that is The Sea and Cake.
"I think ('Inn Keeping') is a
happy accident, landing on that
sequence and messing around
with it, and hearing that it can
be so malleable yet cohesive,"
Prekop said. "I'm pretty happy
with that. It's been the center-
piece of our shows."
The Sea and Cake has been
around since the mid '90s, and
over the years it has undergone
countless developments. Origi-
nally, the group pursued a tradi-
tional rock sound with brashness
and bombast. But the year 2000
arrived with the definitive album
Oui, which took the edge off
things. In the years before Oui,

ects, and this period of individual

"I can't predict exactly what
it will sound like, because it will
have the tendency of The Moon-

recently, its
only connection to Michigan was
the sewage it dumped into the Lit-

"Here's an average-sized white
kid with average speed and quick-
ness, but I knew his heart was
going to get him somewhere and
that that would make the differ-
ence, and I think that did," Peller
said. "If you want one word, he
was a winner."
So that's what Novak did. Win.
Novak led the Trojans to a
57-31 record as a four-year start-
er, the program's best four-year
stretch. In his senior season, he
led the program to its first out-
right division title. Even though
Novak had put himself into the
mix for Indiana's Mr. Basketball
by averaging nearly 27 points and
eight rebounds a game, the offers
weren't comingin.
Valparaiso offered a scholar-
ship - only because its campus is
10 miles from Chesterton - and
thenwithdrew. Butthebigschools
weren't the only big thing that
paid little attention to Novak and
his work ethic that year.
At every one of Novak's game,
a 6-foot-9 freshman was in the
stands. At each of Novak's prac-

tices, the tall kid was there work-
ing up a sweat - but maybe not
enough.
While Novak was working his
tail off, the tall kid's work ethic
wasn't quite there. The class-
room yielded similar results,
with Novak excelling in advanced
placement classes and the tall kid
struggling to pass.
Meanwhile, John Beilein was
struggling mightily in his first
year at Michigan - both on the
court and on the recruiting trail.
Beilein heard about Novak's sit-
uation. With nothing to lose and
few alternatives, Beilein started
showing up in Chesterton's stands
and came away impressed.
That chance he took on the grit-
ty, hard-nosed player established
Michigan's foothold in Chester-
ton.
Novak's commitment was
hardly a splash. Scout.com left
him unranked, without any stars.
Rivals.com almost inexplicably
gave him three stars for commit-
ting to a Big Ten program, but
didn't even give his profile a pic-
ture.
But somewhere else in those
stands with Beilein was that tall
kid. Maybe they even shared a row
once or bumped into each other.
Maybe the kid looked at Beilein in
awe. Maybe he didn't give it much
thought.
Beileinwouldn'thave -couldn't
have - known who he was, but in
the stands with Beilein was the a
sweaty kid who'd just finished his
JV game: Mitch McGary. But the
Novak-Michigan-McGary con-
nection should've stopped there.
McGary's grades continued to
decline - after his junior year, he
was forced to transfer to Brews-
ter Academy, a New Hampshire
prep school - justto give himself a
chance of garnering a scholarship.
Novak, on the other hand, was
making headlines in Ann Arbor,
putting together a stunning rise
from a nobody to a four-year start-
er and three-time captain.
And then McGary turned his
life around. His game followed
closely behind.
"He did not have the work ethic
that Zack had, but I think now he
does," Peller said. "Mitch has come
back since then and I can see the

maturity, I can see the improve-
ment. You can see he's matured a
lot, just talking to him."
Though he didn't even start on
Brewster last year, he made the
honor roll. When summer came
around, Mitch McGary simply
blew up. Playing on the AAU cir-
cuit, he went from being a player
on the rise to one of the summer's
hottest players and finally, to his
current position: No. 2 in the
country.
Somewhere amidst all of the
fame he was receiving, he made
time to stop back in Chesterton.
With the hectic lifestyle of a bas-
ketball phenom, there couldn't
have been much time for the visit.
The same can be said for Novak,
who was busy leading offseason
workouts in Ann Arbor.
But as fate would have it, their
visits home overlapped. Natu-
rally, the two best athletes to
come out of Chesterton in the last
decade would head to the gym,
where they would finally play
together.
It was just a pick-up game
and no one, including Beilein,
was in the stands this time. But
at one time, five years earlier, he
had been. He found Novak, the
scrappy, disregarded kid, straight
out of "Hoosiers." Novak would
take Beilein's program, coming
off a 10-win season - out of the
Big Ten's basement and into the
NCAA Tournament.
When Novak graduates this
year, he'll have left the program
a better place than he found it
- even if McGary hadn't cho-
sen Michigan. But in that small
Indiana town that doesn't even
show up on the state map, Novak
brought the University of Michi-
gan.
The connection was once
bound only by a sewage-filled
river. But when the kid who once
shared the bleachers with John
Beilein committed to Beilein
over Mike Krzyzewski and Duke,
Mitch McGary finished what his
tack Novak started. Together,
they put Michigan on the college
basketball map.

~Offense will be tested by WMU

The Michigan hockey team
stole one last year against West-
ern Michigan.
The Wolver-
ines scored with Western

pulled to tie the Matchup:
game. Then they WMU 5-0-3;
scored again Michigan 6-1-1
with just three When: Friday
seconds remain- and Saturday
ing in overtime 7:35 P.M.
to pull off their Where: Yost
wildest win of Ice Arena
the season on Liveblog:
senior night. Michigandaily.
"We were com
lucky," said
Michigan coach
Red Berenson.
Lucky indeed. Case in point:
the Broncos rolled past Michigan,
5-2, in the CCHA Tournament
semifinals, en route to the cham-
pionship.
Yet Michigan made some of
its own luck, partially because it
knew where to turn for its scor-
ing. Then-senior forward Carl
Hagelin scored both crunch-time
goals.
Who would be the go-to scorer
this year? The answer remained
unclear entering the season.
Maybe an established scorer like
senior forward David Wohlberg
would emerge as the guy, or per-
haps a younger player like junior
forward Chris Brown would
break out.
Really, though, the big question
facing No. 3 Michigan entering
the season was if it has enough
offense, period.
Through eight games, the Wol-
verines (2-1-1CCHA, 6-1-1overall)
have answered with a resounding
"yes."

"We've scored a little more
than I thought we would," Beren-
son said. "I think we've got some
balance. It's not one line that's
carrying our team, we're getting
goals from all the lines. It's not
one class, it's all four classes that
are contributing."
Last year, Michigan ranked
16th in the nation in scoring - not
overpowering but certainly solid.
This year, the Wolverines have
jumped out to the second-best
scoring production in the nation,
averaging 4.88 goals per game.
Not bad, especially considering
they've only given up more than
their scoring average only once
- and that fifth goal came on an
empty-netter in Michigan's lone
loss to Northern Michigan.
But can the Wolverines main-
tain that level of offensive produc-
tion?
Berenson said that Western
Michigan (3-0-1, 5-0-3) would be
even tougher than Ferris State
was last weekend, a team that
came into Ann Arbor with the No.
1 defense in the nation. Michigan
and the fourth-ranked Broncos
will play a weekend series at Yost
Arena beginning Friday.
"They're doing what they did
last year," said Berenson of the
Broncos, who emerged from
the CCHA Tournament to earn
a NCAA berth last year. "And
they're probably doing it harder
now and with a little more confi-
dence because they didn't know at
this time last year how good they
were going to be."
Make no mistake about it,
Western Michigan is legitimate.
The Broncos remain the only
unbeaten team in the CCHA, and
they earned their ever highest
ranking with the fourth spot in
the poll, including one first-place
vote.
Western Michigan will test the
Wolverines' offense. The Broncos,

though, have limited opponents
to just L6 goals per game.
"They didn't lose much from
last year," Berenson said.
Michigan has capitalized on
its depth and the surprising play
of freshmen, like forward Phil Di
Giuseppe, to score heaps of goals.
Berenson has compared this
year's crop of freshmen to the
most recent graduating class that
included players like Hagelin,
Matt Rust and Louie Caporusso.
"When you have freshmen
coming in, you don't really know
what to expect from them," said
senior defensemanGregPateryn.
"But after the first week, you
could see some guys were really
going to stand out this year."
Western Michigan's defenders
have limited opposing offenses
to just under 22 shots per game,
but the Broncos' goalies haven't
played incredibly well. Western
Michigan has played two goalies
- with junior Nick Pisellini and
freshman Frank Slubowski split-
ting time - and the two have
stopped .931 and .918 percent of
shots, respectively.
The Broncos' goalies have
benefited from a strong top line
of scorers. Sophomores Chase
Balisy, Shane Berschbach and
junior Dane Walters have pow-
ered the offense, combining for
34 points through eight games.
And they've taken well to
coach Andy Murray in his first
season. Murray coached for the
NHL's Los Angeles Kings and St.
Louis Blues before making the
move to the collegiate ranks.
Berenson said Western Mich-
igan is playing like a confident
team.
"(Last year) they didn't know
they were going to make the
NCAA Tournament, and make it
to Joe Louis and so on," Beren-
son said. "This will be a real
proving year for them."

Three weeks ago, the Michigan
football team traveled to East Lan-
sing to face Michigan State - the
toughest team on the schedule,
according to
Michigan coach Michigan
Brady Hoke.
On Saturday, at Iowa
the 13th-ranked Matchup:
Wolverines (2-1 Michigan 7-1;
Big Ten, 7-1 Iowa 5-3
overall) travel When: Satur-
to Kinnick Sta- day 12 P.M.
dium to again Where: Kin-
face the tough- nick Stadium
est team on their TV/Radio:
schedule. But ESPN
this time it's
Iowa.
The Hawkeyes (2-2, 5-3) sit one
game behind Michigan, Michigan
State and Nebraska in the Big Ten
Legends division, but are unbeat-
en in Iowa City this season.
"They play awfully well and
they're a very well-coached foot-
ball team and have been for many,
many years," Hoke said. "It will
be the most physical game to this
point for us as ateam."
The Wolverines' only loss of the
season came on the road against
the Spartans, a game that was
plagued with personal fouls and,
well, toughness of all sorts.
Still, for Hoke, that game wasn't
the toughest. This one will be.
"Oh, yeah," Hoke said. "(The
Hawkeyes) always have been (the
toughest), in my opinion. I always
thought they were well-coached
and physical. It's a fun week. As a
defensive line coach, this is fun. I
love this."
Added fifth-year senior captain
David Molk: "They're old-school
football. It's hit-'em, smash-mouth
football. That's what they play.
Always have."
Michigan has dropped its past
two decisions with Iowa and
hasn't won in Iowa City since

MAROSA MCCLA/Daily
Michigan coach Brady Hoke is 1-1 on She road is his first season in Ann Arhor.

2005.
Seeming to ignore the Hawk-
eyes' defensive rankings - they
are in the bottom half of the Big
Ten in both rushing and passing
yards allowed - Hoke has empha-
sized Iowa's tenacious, exemplar
defense to his players.
"Iowa is one of those teams
that's not going to change anything
they do in preparation for you,
especially offensively," said fifth-
year senior defensive end Ryan Van
Bergen. "They're going to do the
same thing they've been doing for,
I don't know how many years."
Saturday's matchup with Iowa
also marks the beginning of Mich-
igan's November slate of games.
The Wolverines' final month con-
sists of consecutive games against
the Hawkeyes, Illinois, No. 9
Nebraska and Ohio State. Those
four teams currently have a com-
bined record of 23-10.
This is exactly the competition
that Hoke wants in November.
"It's going to be a great chal-
lenge for us," Hoke said. "When
you get in November, you play for
championships in the Big Ten con-
ference, and that's kind of how it's
been for many years."
Michigan is certainly within
striking distance of the confer-
ence championship, sitting in a
three-way tie atop the division but

the Wolverines' roster has slowly
begun to deteriorate. Sophomore
safety Carvin Johnson left the
team this week, becoming the
sixth player to depart this fall.
Perhaps more importantly, sev-
eral everyday starters are ques-
tionable entering the weekend.
Redshirt junior safety Jordan
Kovacs missed last Saturday's
game with a knee injury, while
redshirt sophomore offensive
tackle Taylor Lewan and redshirt
junior offensive guard Ricky Bar-
num have both been slowed by
nagging ankle injuries.
Hoke gave no final indication as
to whether any of the three would
play, but he also didn't rule any
player out. Even with the depleted
roster, junior quarterback Denard
Robinson is healthy, and thatgives
Michigan a chance in any game.
"I don't know if our blueprint
is ever going to be different (in
November)," Hoke said. "We want
to run the football. We want to be
able to possess the football. We
want to take care of the football.
"I can't tell you that's going to
be any different, but it's how you
have to improve on a daily basis
so you can play your best football
through the month."
At 7-1 to begin November,
Michigan fans won't be demand-
ing anything different.

egend has it, the field at
Kinnick Stadium talks to
unwanted guests.
They say you can hear the
fan in the first row while you're
in the huddle. They say Iowa's
stadium is
so tight, you
can feel the
noise breath-
ing down the -
back of your
neck.
"They
could prob- TIM
ably touch ROHAN
you," said
junior quar-
terback Denard Robinson.
After driving through miles
of corn stalks, opponents dress
for battle in pink locker rooms.
Ahead of them is an opponent
who doesn'ttry to trick or dis-
guise anyone or anything. Soon
enough, you'll be facing a physi-
cal, unrelenting defense.
Brady Hoke will play the role
of the leader of the unwanted
guests. Unimaginable prior to
the season, Hoke has Michigan at
7-1, ranked 13th in the country.
The seniors can still talk about
how they have something to play
for, how the Big Ten Champion-
ship is within reach. Their voices
grow more confident each week.
All this because Hoke has them
playing the right way. But there's
one thing he has yet to do: Prove
he can win consistently on the
road in the Big Ten.
This is where the Kinnick
Stadium voices come in. The
Spartans were too loud - too
boisterous for Michigan's liking.
The Wolverines had problems
with their snap count. All the
preparation didn't matter when
the Michigan State blitzers could
easily pounce on Denard Rob-
inson once they timed that snap
count perfectly.
Even in the quiet, high-class,
less-than-raucous academia set-
ting of Evanston, Michigan wasn't
prepared in the first half to take.


on Northwestern in their house.
And this field in Iowa can talk,
remember. Silence it - silence
the crowd and the questions
about his team - and Hoke will
have proven this team worthy of
being in the hunt this late in the
season. He may just be able to
add another check to the list of
his impressive start. The noise is
deafening though. The top eight
teams in the Big Ten, regardless
of division, are 39-3 at home this
season. The last time Robinson
threw a pass in Kinnick Stadium,
he was merely a freshman and
in the spotlight for the first time,
charged with leading Michigan
on a game-winning drive against
undefeated Hawkeyes.
The sound reached a crescen-
do as Robinson tossed an inter-
ception with 46 seconds left.
"I actually missed the sig-
nal," Robinson said Wednesday,
recalling what many consider the
defining moment of his freshman
season. "It kind of bothered me
because I think I could've done
better - beinga little calmer
about the situation.... I was just
trying to do so much."
How will he respond this'
time? Could he rise above his
past mistakes - including a three
interception half at Evanston
and a poor showing in East Lan-
sing - and play with poise? Can
he silence the noise - the racing
thoughts - within himself?
The last time Michigan took
the field, Robinson was calm
and the offense looked a lot like
Michigan. Less Robinson, more
Toussaint. Questions turned
from whether Robinson could
ever figure out his mechanical
issues in the passing game to
whether Fitzgerald Toussaint
could keep this up.
Offensive coordinator Al
Borges said that's what the
offense is supposed to look like:
pound the ball 20 times with
Toussaint, with Robinson safe
behind "BREAK ONLY IF NEC-
ESSARY" glass. Sounds like


Michigan circa Lloyd Carr and
Bo Schembechler, right?
But Ricky Barnum and Taylor
Lewan - the whole left side of
the offensive line - are banged
up; and Michael Schofield can
only spot one of them.
But Toussaint had been absent
in so many games this season,
carrying the ball 16 times for 32
yards in Michigan's two road
games. Against the Spartans, he
had two carries for seven yards.
But Hoke should know better,
that the noise is louder on the
road. That staying true to your
identity is all you can do when
it gets loud. Players revert to
muscle memory and what feels
comfortable when it gets loud.
Toussaint and the offensive
line will have their chance to
prove that not only was last
week's Purdue game how Michi-
gan runs the ball, but also how
Michigan will run the ball.
Iowa plans to run the ball too.
"And they're going to dare you
to try and stop it," said fifth-year
senior defensive end Ryan Van
Bergen.
There will be no tricks. No
fancy gimmicks. Just tough on
tough. For a coach that has fed
his players three square meals
of toughness since he arrived in
January - he recently called out
their manhood, saying football
players don't wear long sleeves
when it gets cold outside, they
embrace it - this is the ultimate
test: Is his team truly tough
enough? The winning team won't
make the most noise. It'll be
whoever silences the other long
enough to either bask in the glory
of its own screaming crowd or to
hear a collective audible moan
once the Wolverines answer all
these questions.
Regardless, by Saturday's end,
Kinnick Stadium will have said
something about Brady Hoke's
team.
