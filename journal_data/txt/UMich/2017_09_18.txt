Three Black students’ room 

doors in Michigan Community 
Scholars Program, located in 
West Quad Residence Hall, were 
vandalized with racial slurs over 
the weekend. The hate speech, 
including “N-----,” was written 
underneath their name tags 
placed on their dorm room doors.

LSA 
sophomore 
Travon 

Stearns, one of the students 
whose door was vandalized, said 
he did not see the nametag when 
he first woke up — it was around 
1 p.m., when he came back from 
the dining hall. His nametag bore 
the racial slur. His roommate’s 
also had slurs, but were not 
racially charged. Strens said he 
notified his RA, where he noticed 
her nametag had scribbles on it. 
She contacted DPSS. 

“When I got up this morning, 

I was ready to focus and get 
ready to do my studies and 
my homework. I planned on 
dedicating this whole day to 
prepare for the week and get 
homework done...like a regular 
Sunday,” he said. “But when I saw 
that, it kind of messed me up a 
little bit. From there, I had to take 
other steps to really try to get to 
the bottom of this and report it.”

Stearns said he posted a 

picture on Snapchat, which his 
friends screenshotted and posted 
on Twitter.

“Everybody was, of course, 

especially 
in 
the 
Black 

community and even my friends 
who are not part of the Black 
community, was pretty outraged 

and really concerned. But they 
really were there for me and let 
me know that if I needed any 
help with support, they’re there 
was me. They were really upset 
with what had occurred. Very 
outraged.”

Stearns met with DPSS Sunday 

afternoon. He said they were 

“very concerned” and pointed 
him to resources he can use on 
campus. He also said security 
took the nametags as evidence 
and to look for fingerprints.

Stearns said this is the first 

time he had faced direct racism 
before. However, despite this, he 

Alumni of The Michigan Daily, 

several of whom are Pulitzer Prize 
winners, participated in panels 
on sports journalism’s role in the 
21st century, diversity for women 
and minorities in the newsroom, 
alternative career paths from a 
journalism background and the 
role of student publications Friday 
afternoon in Rackham Auditorium. 
About 200 students, faculty and 
University of Michigan alumni 
attended the panels throughout the 
day. 

Celebrating its 127th year of 

operation, the Daily invited alumni 
back to campus for a weekend of 
reunion and reminiscing about 
their 
past 
Daily 
experiences. 

Many former Daily staff members 
pointed to the recent digitization 
of University newspapers from 
the past 125 years by the Bentley 
Historical Library as a way to 
connect with the history of the 
Daily, the University and the world.

The event was co-sponsored by 

the University’s Office of Student

On Sept. 17, 2017, three 

Black University of Michigan 
students were targeted with 
racially derogatory language in 
the form of defaced name tags 
on their dorm doors. This is 
not only a crime of vandalism, 
but also a hate crime carried 
out by those with access to our 
campus and residence halls, 
presumably 
underclassmen 

students. As we move into the 
third week of classes, we have 
already encountered deliberate 
racism via social media and 
now directly to students in 
their campus homes, a space 
where they should feel safe.

We, 
the 
Black 
Student 

Union, 
stand 
in 
solidarity 

with the three Black students 
who were directly targeted 
by this heinous offense. As 
an organization, our mission

those affected by crimes such as 
this. We expect an appropriate

On Friday, the University 

of 
Michigan 
brought 
its 

Bicentennial festivities to the 
place where it all began.

A founding ceremony took 

place in Detroit’s Grand Circus 
Park as a nod to the University’s 
1817 founding in Detroit, as 
well as an acknowledgment 
of 
upcoming 
partnerships 

and commitments to the city. 
Several seminars also took 
place earlier in the day, ranging 
in topics from investments in 
the city’s future to innovation in 
education, arts and technology.

University alum and long-

time local journalist Carmen 
Harlan emceed the ceremony 
and spoke to the significance 
of the University’s founding in 
Detroit.

“What (University founders 

Augustus Woodward, Gabriel 
Richard and John Monteith) 
created was not just what is 
now the University of Michigan 
but also public education in 
Michigan,” Harlan said. “In 
other words, all the outstanding 
public universities and colleges, 
high schools, middle schools, 
and elementary schools that 
we have today, started here, in 
Detroit, with the University 
of Michigan ... Today, as we 
celebrate 
this 
anniversary, 

we the people of Detroit and 
Michigan, must recommit to 
public education for the next 
200 years.”

Harlan was not the only 

one 
speaking 
of 
renewed 

commitments.

Award-winning actresses doing statewide tour on economic disparities in food service jobs

Academy 
Award-winning 

actresses Jane Fonda and Lily 
Tomlin 
drew 
an 
audience 

of 
about 
300 
students, 

staff 
and 
local 
residents 

Friday 
afternoon 
to 
the 

Power Center. The celebrity 

activists, 
accompanied 
by 

Saru Jayaraman — co-founder 
of 
Restaurant 
Opportunities 

Centers United, an organization 
that aims to improve restaurant 
industry standards nationwide 
— 
discussed 
economic 

inequality and the minimum 
wage’s effects on women in the 
restaurant industry.

Prior to the event, the Daily 

sat 
down 
with 
Fonda 
and 

Tomlin to discuss what the two 
have been highlighting thus far 
on their statewide tour.

“Ann Arbor made sense as a 

stop for us for us — it’s a college 
town, a progressive city and the 
food industry employs many 
college-aged women who we 
hope to advocate for here,” 
Tomlin said. “We need college 
students to be a part of this 
platform, this change. It’s very 

important.”

Fonda 
echoed 
Tomlin’s 

sentiments 
regarding 
Ann 

Arbor being an appropriate 
locale to discuss this issue. 

“It’s important for Lily and I 

to bring our message to a place 
like Ann Arbor, where we can 
hope, even at a minimum, to 
help make contact with people,

MONDAY MEMORIES

On Sunday night, more than 

100 students from the Michigan 
Community Scholars Program 
learning community gathered in 
the Multipurpose Room of West 
Quadrangle Residence Hall to 
show support and solidarity 
against the racist vandalism that 
targeted three Black student 
residents.

David Schoem, director of 

MCSP and an adjunct associate 
professor, led the event.

“We feel terrible that in 

our community they had to 
experience 
those 
disgusting 

things that were put on their 
doors, and we want to show our 
support and love,” he said. “We 
hope you will feel that we are all 
here to express that to you.”

Schoem said such actions are 

meant to threaten and intimidate 
members of the community, but 
it will not be tolerated. He said 
an attack against one is an attack 
against all.

Wendy 
Woods, 
associate 

director of MCSP, compared the 
hateful incidents occurring in 
West Quad to such an incident 
happening in someone’s family 
home.

“In other words, it happened 

in your home,” she said. “That 
is probably one of the ways 
you might most make someone 
feel violated or insecure — by 
actually coming into their own 
home and putting up something 
like that. It’s just like if you are 
living in your homes at home and 
you come home and your house 
has been broken into.”

Woods noted in her time 

addressing 
MCSP, 
she 
has 

recognized 
it 
as 
a 
brave 

community.

“We’re 
not 
talking 
about 

free speech in this instance, 
we’re not talking about coming 
up and talking to someone 
and exchanging views with 
them,” she said. “To do (this), to 
deface room or where they live, 
basically is an act of cowardice.”

Angela Dillard, the associate 

dean of undergraduate education 
in LSA, was next to take the floor.

Dillard said the LSA Dean’s 

Office has been actively in 
contact with the President’s 
Office, targeted students and 
greater community to determine 
how the University will best 
respond to the crime.

“We advocate on behalf of all 

undergraduates at the University 
all the time. ... We really want to 
try and do a better job building 
relationships with students this 

year,” she said. “We think it’s 
going to be another tough year, 
we think that this stuff is going 
to keep happening, that it’s 
going to keep testing us and it’s 
going to test our resolve and 
our ability to respond and to 
respond well.”

John Seto, the director of 

Housing Security, also spoke, 
emphasizing the event is under 
investigation.

“We take these types of 

instances very seriously, this is 
going to be investigated, and it 
is a priority,” he said. “Housing 
Security 
and 
University 

Police have already started 
investigation and have made 
contact with the residents that 
have been impacted.”

Seto also affirmed Housing 

Security’s support for students, 
saying students may notice 
more security officers in the 
halls and encouraging students 
to reach out if they have 
questions.

Henderson, a resident adviser 
in MCSP, said she and her

ROBERT BUECHLER/DAILY

George Hastings, a retired judge, speaks alongside distinguished Michigan 
Daily alumni at Rackham on Friday.

Publications and Wallace House, 
home 
of 
the 
Knight-Wallace 

Journalism Fellowship and The 
Livingston 
Awards 
for 
Young 

Journalists.

Lisa Powers, event coordinator 

and 
Student 
Publications 

Development /Alumni Relations 
Director, 
said 
the 
panel 
and 

weekend sought to connect alumni 
with current students and forge 
relationships over a mutual respect 
for the Daily.

“I wanted to bring as many 

alumni and students together and 
celebrate everything that makes the 
Daily relevant and past, present and 
future, it all comes together,” Powers 
said. “We want our alumni events 
and our student recognition to 
happen at the same time whenever 
possible so this was an opportunity 
to do that.”

A discussion on sports journalism 

and how the genre has changed with 
the introduction and widespread 
usage of social media kicked off the 
panel series. Moderated by Leba 
Hertz, the arts and entertainment 
editor 
of 
the 
San 
Francisco 

Chronicle, 
the 
panel 
featured 

prominent figures in sports media, 
more recent University graduates 
and Laney Byler, current Daily 
senior sports editor.

Ken Davidoff, sports journalist 

for the New York Post, said he leans 
heavily on Twitter for his work 
and it forces normally long-winded 
journalists to be concise and direct 
with their reporting.

“I think tweeting is an art form,” 

Davidoff said. “I love tweeting. I’m 
all about brevity and efficiency … I 
think anyone who tweets twice in 
a row should pay a fine. Anything 
you can’t communicate in 140 
characters on Twitter is not worth 
communicating. I think social media 
has made me a better writer because 
it’s made me more efficient.”

With the increased amount of 

social media in sports journalism 
comes the added price of gender 
discrimination from behind a screen 

according to Shannon Lynch, recent 
alum and social media coordinator 
at MLB.com. She said women are 
still highly scrutinized in sports 
journalism, especially in the digital 
age due to increased anonymity 
online.

“I think it’s no secret that women 

on Twitter who work in sports 
are a target of a different kind of 
hatred 
and 
misunderstanding 

I would say,” Lynch said. “The 
internet unfortunately gives people 
that platform to say whatever 
they feel without dealing with the 
consequences of it.”

Byler echoed Lynch’s statements 

as a panelist and said some 
individuals online have questioned 
her coverage because she is a woman 
reporting on sports.

“I definitely think there is a little 

bit of extra (pressure),” Byler said. 
“We have to prove ourselves a little 
bit more. … People would tweet ‘Are 
you sure? Are you sure you know 
what you’re talking about?’ and yes, 
I do. I know as much as the next 
person, but there is that little bit of 
skepticism.”

The following panel, featuring 

three 
Pulitzer 
Prize 
winners, 

expanded upon Lynch’s and Byler’s 
comments on women in sports and 
focused on diversity for women 
and underrepresented minorities in 
journalism today.

Eugene Robinson, columnist at 

the Washington Post and MSNBC 
commentator, was co-editor in chief 
of the Daily in 1973. He was awarded 
the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary 
in 2009 for his columns on the 
election of former President Barack 
Obama. He also currently serves on 
the Pulitzer Prize Board.

According 
to 
the 
American 

Society of News Editors 2016 
Diversity Survey, 17 percent of 
the workforce in newsrooms are 
minority journalists. The same 
survey reported about 33 percent of 
newsroom employees are women. 
Robinson said he has seen the entire 
arc of newsroom diversity in his 
career, from being one of the first 
four African-American reporters at 
the Post to seeing the recent dip in 
newsroom diversity even at the Post.

“Things got a lot better and 

now they’re starting to get worse,” 
Robinson said. “If you look at 
the (Washington Post’s) overall 
numbers, in terms of minorities, 
the Post newsroom is something 
like 31 percent minority, which is 
a lot better than it appears right 
now. However, if you look at our 
masthead, it’s way whiter and 
more male than it was just a few 
years ago and I think that is true 
when you look around at who’s 
running the various sections.”

Lisa Pollak, former Daily news 

editor, won the 1997 Pulitzer for 
Feature Writing while writing for 
The Baltimore Sun for her story 
on a baseball umpire whose son 
died of a genetic disease. She said 
journalists miss stories without 
adequate diversity and she is 
still seeing the same issues with 
a lack of minority representation 
in journalism today as she was 
when she was on staff at the 
Daily in the late ’80s.

“I’m struck by how 30 years 

ago at the Daily, we were talking 

at the Daily about how to increase 
the 
number 
of 
non-white 

students who were on staff and 
everywhere I’ve worked, I feel 
like in 30 years, at newspapers 
and public radio or a startup, it 
is the same problem and that is 
not what I would have expected 
and it’s unfortunate,” Pollak 
said.

Ann 
Marie 
Lipinski, 

co-editor in chief of the Daily in 
1977 and curator of the Nieman 
Foundation for Journalism at 
Harvard University, was part of 
the team at The Chicago Tribune 
that was awarded a Pulitzer in 
1988 for Investigative Reporting 
on issues of self-interest in 
Chicago’s city council. She said 
while it is possible to reprimand 
specific instances of sexism and 
racism in articles and in the 
newsroom, the larger systemic 
issues of diversity are difficult 
to change.

the University came together. 
There will also be a MCSP 
meeting Sunday night to discuss 
the incident, he explained.

and said it’s unacceptable,” he 
said. “Campus security talked to 
me to get the full story. I think the 
campus is handling the situation 
really well...action is definitely 
being taken. The University is 
really putting effort to get to the 
bottom of this.”

What caught Stearns off 

guard, he said, was that MCSP is 
considered to be one of the most 
inclusive spaces on campus. He 
said he hopes people will take the 
situation seriously.

“Because it’s not (a joke). 

Maybe people do those things 
as a joke but they don’t realize 
what 
psychologically 
impact 

that can have on a person,” he 
said. “Especially since I am 
at the University to study and 
get an education. But then I 
have to worry about the feeling 
of oppression and not being 
accepted. I have to watch my 
back at all times. And that just 
puts extra pressure on me on top 
of regular college life.” 

LSA junior Sydney Whack is 

a friend of one of the students 
whose door was marked — 
she initially saw the photo on 
Snapchat.

“I made sure he was good,” 

she said. “He said he was 
going to report it to the RA. I 
know he was pretty upset.”

Pictures of the incidents 

were 
spread 
by 
angered 

students across Twitter.

“Everyone’s pretty upset,” 

Whack said. “I know some 
people have made tweets 
and 
stuff 
addressing 
the 

University. A lot of people 
have 
reposted 
on 
their 

Snapchat 
and 
stuff 
and 

they’re just really really upset 
because that’s vile.”

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s chapter of the 
Black Student Union released 
a statement on the incident 
later 
Sunday 
afternoon, 

standing in solidarity with 
the three students.

“We expect an appropriate 

response from The University, 
including 
an 
investigation 

and consequences for those 
involved in the vandalism,” it 
read. “In times like these, it is 
important that we do not act 
solely out of the frustration, 
anger, 
and 
sadness 
we 

may be feeling. We have 
to channel these emotions 
into productive action, in an 
attempt to leave the campus 
better than we found it.”

The University of Michigan’s 

College Democrats social justice 
committee also made a statement 
on 
Twitter, 
quoting 
BSU’s 

original tweet.

denouncing the vandalism.

Schoem 
wrote 
in 
the 

statement; 
“On

safety, 

security and well-being of all 
of our students.’

convince them to talk about this 
issue with their friends, collect 
signatures for the ballot, go to 
town halls and help develop 
a people’s platform that will 
help talk about all of the issues 
facing this country and this 
state,” Fonda said.

Fonda 
and 
Tomlin 
both 

otably appeared in “9 to 5” 
which premiered in 1980.

Lilly 
Fink 
Shapiro, 
the 

Sustainable 
Food 
Systems 

coordinator at the University, 
opened the event, and noted 
there are 60 faculty and staff 
members working together at 
the University to explore issues 
related 
to 
food 
production 

and distribution, as well as 
the policies that shape the 
emergence of different food 
system models globally.

“The University of Michigan 

is on the map for our world-
class 
research, 
curricular 

and 
interdisciplinary 
study 

of sustainable food systems,” 
Shapiro said. “We are one of the 
few Universities in the country 
to offer both an undergraduate 
minor, a graduate certificate in 
sustainable food systems, and 
we have five tenure-track faculty 
who are a part of a cluster hire 
to teach and conduct research in 
this growing field.”

Tomlin was the first speaker 

to take the stage: She performed 
a monologue as Judith Beasley 
— a character she portrayed in 
sketches throughout her career 
on Saturday Night Live. Tomlin 
explained through her monologue 
that 
Beasley 
represents 
the 

millions 
of 
waitresses, 
like 

herself, “who have worked hard 
all their lives and yet cat can 
barely eke out a living.”

Since the first minimum wage 

law was passed in 1938, Tomlin 
explained, restaurant workers’ 
wages had gone from zero dollars 
per hour to $2.13 per hour at the 
federal level and $3.38 dollars per 
hour in Michigan — a raise of $3 
over 80 years.

“And no, this is not fake news,” 

said Tomlin, acting the part of 
Beasley. “We restaurant workers 
are facing the greatest level of 
economic inequality since the 
Gilded Age and 70 percent of tip 
workers who earn that measly 
3.38 an hour are — drumroll, wait 
for it — women.”

Tomlin 
described 
an 

overworked waitress — speed-

walking with multiple plates up 
and down her arms, sometimes 
with carpal tunnel syndrome in 
her elbows.

Still acting the part of Beasley, 

Tomlin said, she became the 
primary breadwinner in her 
household when her husband 
became injured; she needed to 
provide a good home for her 
children.

“What was I to do?” she said. 

“Working as a waitress was the 
only skillset I had. I hope no one 
snickered at that phrase, ‘skillset,’ 
because waiting on tables — to do 
it right — requires one’s personal 
best. Yes indeed, with low wages, 
we still have high aspirations.”

Speaking as herself, Tomlin 

used the term “breastaurant” 
— referring to restaurants that 
employ a female waiting staff. She 
pointed out an irony of women 
surrounded by food in their jobs, 
and yet dependent on food stamps 
to support themselves and their 
families.

Speaking as herself, Tomlin 

noted she was born and raised 
in Detroit; her parents were both 
blue collar workers – her father, a 
factory worker, and her mother, a 
nurse’s aide.

“I know what it’s like to live 

paycheck to paycheck and not 
have any savings,” she said. “I 
went into food service very early.”

Tomlin said she got a job as 

an usher at the Avalon Theater 
in Detroit; she worked bringing 
food trays to hospital patients 
and later she worked at a Howard 
Johnson’s in New York City.

In 
her 
opening 
remarks, 

Fonda noted she and Tomlin 
advocated for female worker’s 
rights in their 1980 comedy “9 
to 5” — a film in which three 
female workers attempt to get 
even with their misogynistic 
boss.

Fonda explained she, Tomlin 

and Jayaraman are working to 
get the One Fair Wage measure 
on the ballot for the midterm 
election in November 2018; 
350,000 signatures are needed 
for the petition. According to 
Fonda, such act would raise 
the minimum wage to $12 in 
Michigan. It would also phase 
out the two-tiered wage system 
in which different groups of 
workers receive different pays 
and set the same wage for tip 
and non-tip workers. 

“It’s seems ridiculous that 

we’re 
applauding 
for 
$12 

minimum wage, doesn’t it?” 
Fonda said. “I mean it’s got to 
eventually go much higher than 

that. What on Earth does the 
owner (of a restaurant) think 
when he, or she — but they’re 
mostly ‘he’s’ —knows that his 
workers, and they’re mostly 
women in Michigan — 80 
percent of restaurant workers 
are female and they have three 
times the poverty level as other 
workers, and they’re heavily 
dependent on food stamps and 
other social services — what 
does an owner think when he 
knows that his workers are 
having to work two jobs, maybe 
even three, just to make ends 
meet?”

Fonda said she, Tomlin and 

Jayaraman are in Michigan 
because for decades it has 
been a steadfast Democratic 
stronghold, 
it 
was 
the 

birthplace of the American 
labor movement and it has the 
largest 
Black-majority 
city 

in the country, among other 
attributes.

“We’re 
here 
because 
we 

think Michigan can become 
a template for the rest of the 
country,” Fonda said.

According 
to 
Fonda, 
the 

National Restaurant Association, 
which 
represents 
more 
than 

300,000 
restaurants 
in 
the 

United States, is very against the 
One Fair Wage mission and the 
ROC; it also favors the two-tiered 
system because it guarantees big 
restaurant chains can make a lot 
of at the expense of waiters.

Fonda 
explained 
seven 

states, including California and 
Minnesota, have only one-tier 
systems — where everyone earns 
the same minimum wage — and 
people working in restaurants 
still get tips.

Jayaraman 
noted 
the 

restaurant 
industry 
is 
the 

largest and fastest growing 
sector of the U.S. economy, 
comprising more than 12 million 
workers.

“Despite the size of this 

industry, despite its growth, 
despite the fact that most of 
us have worked in it, despite 
the fact that we actually, just 
last year, made world history 
becoming the first nation on 
Earth that is now spending 
more money on food bought 
outside of the home, rather than 
food bought inside the home 
— despite all of those things, 
it continues to be the absolute 
lowest paying wage job in the 
United States,” Jayaraman said.

and executive director of the 
United Tribes of Michigan, 
discussed the Treaty of Fort 
Meigs, which transferred land 
from local Anishinabe tribes 
and made the founding of the 
University possible.

“The 
struggle 
to 
fully 

implement 
the 
treaty 
took 

many decades,” Ettawageshik 
said, explaining the efforts to 
improve Native American access 
to education at the University.

“History teaches us, however, 

that we must continually refresh 
our agreements and assert our 

rights,” he added, describing the 
200th anniversary as a chance 
to renew commitments to the 
Michigan tribes who gave up 
their lands.

Present at the festival were 

several University departments 
and student organizations with 
ties to the metro Detroit area.

One such group is Seven 

Mile 
Music, 
which 
brings 

music education to underserved 
communities 
in 
Detroit. 

According to LSA senior Tyler 
Neiss, the organization was 
founded in response to Detroit 
Public Schools cutting arts and 
music programing funds in 2013.

“Seven 
Mile 
Music 
is 

especially compelled by our 

love for public access to music 
because most of our members 
went to public schools and 
first were engaged with music 
through our public education,” 
said LSA sophomore Kirtana 
Choragudi.

However, 
Choragudi 
and 

Neiss were among the few 
University students present at 
the day’s celebration. The event 
was open to the public, and 
most of the several hundred 
attendees 
were 
faculty 
or 

guests who were not associated 
with the University.

“Detroit’s 
a 
really 
great 

place, and I wish people would 
care about it more,” Choragudi 
said.

only two Black residents were 
targeted.

“I’m just disappointed more 

than anything else. … People 
should be ashamed of themselves 
— the people who did this — they 
should be embarrassed,” she 
said. “If anyone has any of idea 

of who did this, or if you did it, I 
encourage you to come forward. 
… This is very serious.”

Students were made aware 

of resources they can turn to 
in response to for support in 
response to this at: specifically, 
the Dean of Students Office, as 
well as the Bias Response Team 
— a group of professional staff 
who assist in managing incidents 
of bias.

Students were also encouraged 

to write the expressions “We 
stand together for social justice” 
and “#mcspstandstogether” and 
tape it to all of the doors in the 
living community.

After the speakers addressed 

the attendees, students broke 
into small groups to reflect on 
the incident. The Daily was 
asked to leave for this portion of 
the event.

SOLIDARITY

I

t was 2:30 a.m. on a 
Thursday. 
I 
had 
just 

finished working a shift 

in my lab and needed to start 
fixing my newspaper column 
because it was ripped apart 
by the editor. As I was getting 
ready 
to 
write, 
I 
opened 

Spotify and was greeted by 
an advertisement of Taylor 
Swift’s new single. Because 
I hadn’t heard this song all 
the way through, I decided to 
give it a listen.

I attempted to work but 

couldn’t think straight while 
the chorus of seemingly never-
ending “look what you made 
me do’s” reverberated through 
my head from Swift’s cleverly 
titled single “Look What You 
Made Me Do.” As much as 
I would like to say, “No one 
cares what you did, Taylor,” I 
would be wrong considering 
her single broke streaming and 
viewing records on Spotify and 
YouTube. People idolize Taylor 
Swift and often seem to be 
more invested in her life than 
their own. This is a problem.

In modern society, social 

media and even television have 
evolved in a way that favors 
making the famous even more 
famous. 
Celebrities 
thrive 

off 
publicity, 
and 
through 

platforms such as Instagram, 
Snapchat 
and 
Twitter, 

providing 
them 
with 
this 

notoriety has become a part of 
our everyday lives.

But 
what 
makes 
us 

interested in celebrities in 
the first place? Well, most 
of the time they have lives 
that are more interesting and 
extravagant than our own. 
They have lifestyles that most 
of us regard as fantasy, and 
social media has allowed us to 
admire these lifestyles 24/7. 
In the amount of time it takes 
to unlock a phone and open 
Instagram, you can see where 
Leonardo DiCaprio decided to 
go after winning his Oscar or 
what color Lamborghini Justin 
Bieber decided to drive to the 

MTV Video Music Awards. By 
commenting on and reacting 
to photos and videos, we’re 
provided with the illusion 
that we’re having an impact or 
taking part in celebrities’ lives 
— but we’re not. 

The truth is that we’ve all 

become pawns in their personal 
marketing campaigns. No one 
seems to take a step back and 
ask themselves, “Why do I care 
about these people? Why am 
I one of 500,000 commenting 
on Kylie Jenner’s selfie? Aren’t 
there more important things I 
should be focusing on?”

The 
average 
U.S. 
adult 

spends more than six hours 
per week on social media, 
and I bet that a good chunk 
of this time is spent viewing 
celebrities. 
If 
you 
don’t 

believe me, just look at Kim 
Kardashian — one of the 
most popular individuals on 
Instagram with 103 million 
followers. That’s roughly a 
third of the United States’s 
population. 
Imagine 
what 

people 
would 
be 
able 
to 

accomplish 
if 
the 
total 

time spent on Kardashian’s 
Instagram page were spent on 
something useful.

Even television has shifted 

its focus to endorsing the 
famous and making them 
viral sensations. “Celebrity 
Family Feud,” “Hollywood 
Game Night” and “Running 
Wild with Bear Grylls,” for 
example, are shows that never 
shift their spotlight from 
the rich and famous because 

featuring 
celebrities 
can 

boost ratings and entertain.

As a result of this trend, 

reality 
competition 
shows 

are no longer about finding a 
star. Unlike “American Idol,” 
which did an extremely good 
job of placing emphasis on the 
individuality and development 
of its contestants, shows like 
“The Voice” and “America’s Got 
Talent” are about marketing 
the judges and serving as a 
platform to further perpetuate 
their 
celebrity 
status. 
A 

contestant’s 
performance 

is merely background noise 
while the camera forces you 
to examine every change in 
a judge’s facial expression as 
they ponder whether they like 
what they’re seeing.

Though these competitions 

have 
each 
produced 
11 

winners, none of them have 
had mainstream commercial 
success. 
But 
for 
celebrity 

judges 
like 
Adam 
Levine 

and 
Blake 
Shelton, 
these 

shows have allowed for the 
advertisement 
of 
comeback 

albums, live performances and 
creation of fashion lines while 
simultaneously 
establishing 

relationships with a large, 
diverse audience.

I’m not saying that the over-

marketization of celebrities 
is always a bad thing. Some 
of them are great role models 
who 
are 
truly 
inspiring. 

But when you find yourself 
scrutinizing every detail of 
Taylor Swift’s feuds, listening 
to “Look What You Made Me 
Do” on repeat to decipher the 
lyrics and choosing sides in 
her celebrity row, it might be 
time for a reality check. People 
need to spend more time 
focusing on their own lives 
and aspirations, because they 
can make far more important 
contributions to society than 
a poorly written diss track or a 
viral selfie.

W

hen I was younger, 
I had an imaginary 
friend 
named 

Raleigh. Together, we played 
on an imaginary soccer team 
called the Wild-Winds. We 
went to school together and 
had playdates after class. Just 
as I awaited Santa’s arrival by 
placing cookies and milk on the 
fireplace mantel on Christmas 
Eve or delicately put my freshly 
pulled teeth under my pillow at 
night expecting the tooth fairy, 
Raleigh sprung from the depths 
of my imagination — a false 
reality which others around 
me validated. My mother had 
a soccer jersey for the Wild-
Winds team made for me. 
She 
intricately 
gift-wrapped 

and placed “Santa’s” presents 
around our Christmas tree. She 
slid dollar bills under my pillow 
in exchange for my teeth.

Having grown out of our 

childhood 
fantasies, 
as 
a 

society it is safe to say that 
we 
don’t 
think 
like 
this 

anymore. There is no make-
believe 
or 
magic. 
Parents 

won’t 
contextualize 
or 

qualify the abstractions of 
our imagination. Instead of 
creating an imaginary soccer 
team to play on, we now say 
things like “I can’t imagine 
that Cristiano Ronaldo won’t 
be considered one of the best 
soccer 
players 
ever.” 
It’s 

fair to say there’s a societal 
normalcy in this concreteness 
— the improbable remains 
intangible. At least this was 
what I thought until recently.

My reflections regarding 

Raleigh are not meant to 
bombard you with memories 
of my childhood. Instead, I use 
him to draw a parallel to my 
“imagination” today. I would 
never 
have 
imagined 
my 

identity as a Black American 
woman 
would 
become 
as 

threatened as it has within 
the past few months. I would 
never 
have 
imagined 
that 

others like myself who belong 
to 
minority 
communities 

would have to fear losing their 
homes or families. I would 
never have imagined that the 
process of “making America 
great 
again” 
included 
the 

blatant resurgence of racism 
and racially charged violence.

Most significantly, I would 

never have imagined that fear, 
hate and violence touching the 
very core of our lives — once 
figments of my imagination — 
would become validated by the 
government and society, just like 
how Raleigh was legitimized 
by 
my 
mother. 
Maybe 
my 

thoughts were incorrect. Has 
the improbable, or outrageous 
or absurd — the unimaginable — 
become tangible? 

Last 
week, 
the 
seventh 

season of “American Horror 
Story” 
premiered. 
Spoiler 

alert: This season’s storyline 
centers on an American woman 
named Ally who experiences 
extreme 
emotional 
turmoil 

and 
excessive 
paranoia 

following President Donald 
Trump’s election. Her phobias 
actualize, and she seemingly 
hallucinates 
terrifying 

interactions 
with 
clowns, 

which others view as a figment 
of her imagination or as her 
“going crazy.”

In other words, Trump’s 

election reached the depth 
of her imagination. Her story 
mirrors 
my 
reflections 
of 

Raleigh 
and 
the 
political 

and social climate of today’s 
society (minus the clowns). 
The 2016 presidential election 
and subsequent policies and 
events 
under 
the 
Trump 

administration serve as the 
tipping point for Ally at the 
same time the unimaginable 
(killer 
clowns) 
becomes 

tangible, haunting each aspect 
of her everyday life.

I do want to make sure 

everyone 
understands 
that 

this is a dramatization. We 
hopefully aren’t hallucinating 
killer clowns or being consumed 
by our phobias because of 
President Trump’s election.

However, I aim to draw 

your 
attention 
to 
the 

connection. What we thought 
was impossible or outlandish 
or discriminatory has become 
very real, very quickly. I 
use the word “we” here to 
describe we as human beings, 
regardless of race, gender, 
religion, sexual orientation or 
political affiliation.

We must recognize some 

faults 
or 
tensions 
in 
the 

decisions of our executive, 
legislative 
and 
judicial 

branches 
of 
government, 

which, in turn, trickle down 
into 
our 
society 
through 

violence and use of hateful 
rhetoric. We as human beings 
must 
see 
and 
feel 
these 

divisions emerging, whether 
they’re in our own lives or in 
what we view through media 
outlets. We as human beings 
must 
observe 
the 
Trump 

administration’s 
progressive 

action to marginalize certain 
communities or those who 
embody certain identities. For 
it would be rather impossible 
not to witness this unfolding 
before our eyes.

Now, whether you find these 

developments “unimaginable” 
or “imaginable” may be the 
source of our agreement or 
disagreement. However, I hope 
we can all recognize a shift in 
our political and social climate 
as of late in light of events like 
the 
Trump 
administration’s 

rescinding of DACA, banning 
of transgender individuals in 
the military and “travel ban,” 
the violence in Charlottesville, 
Va., and Betsy Devos’s recent 
criticism of Title IX.

I no longer play make-

believe soccer games with 
Raleigh or wait for visits from 
Santa and the tooth fairy. 
Instead, I imagine what will 
come of this country in the 
next four years.

How about you?

T

his academic year, we 
have already witnessed 
two 
record-breaking 

hurricanes, a massive fire in 
California and devastating floods 
in South Asia. “Climate change” 
is 
the 
word 
on 
everyone’s 

lips. Here at the University of 
Michigan, we go to great efforts 
to ensure that we’re doing our 
part to combat climate change 
and promote a healthy earth. We 
are, after all, the Leaders and 
the Best. But why is it that when 
it comes to addressing some 
of the largest causes of global 
climate change, the University 
is just following the crowd? 

One of the largest causes of 

global climate change is, by the 
way, the animal food industry.

As a progressive, forward-

thinking institution that prides 
itself on its environment and 
sustainability 
efforts, 
the 

University should be a societal 
leader 
when 
it 
comes 
to 

acknowledging and responding 
to the devastating relationship 
between 
animal 
foods 
and 

climate change. Instead, the 
University decidedly ignores 
the huge role animal food plays 
in perpetuating climate change.

Studies after studies point 

to animal agriculture not only 
as “bad for the environment,” 
but as the single biggest factor 
hurting 
the 
environment. 

Georgetown 
J.D. 
candidate 

Christopher Hyner wrote an 
excellent article, entitled “A 
Leading Cause of Everything,” 
for 
the 
Georgetown 

Environmental Law Review. He 
states that “animal agriculture 
is a leading cause of many major 
environmental 
problems 
we 

face globally and domestically—
most 
importantly, 
climate 

change. … This means that 
animal agriculture must be a 
central element of our efforts to 
mitigate climate change.”

I encourage all of you to 

read Hyner’s article. But for 
those of you who will inevitably 
form your opinions without 
doing 
sufficient 
research, 

I will briefly touch on the 
grave implications of animal 
agriculture. In South America, 

cattle ranching is responsible 
for 75 percent of deforestation 
in the Brazilian Amazon. At 
least one-third of public lands in 
the contiguous United States is 
devoted to animal agriculture. 
Animal agriculture is also the 
number one consumer of fresh 
water in the U.S, according to 
Hyner’s research.

Fifty-one 
percent 
of 

worldwide 
greenhouse 
gas 

emissions come from livestock 
and 
their 
byproducts, 
and 

replacing livestock products 
with 
more 
sustainable 

alternatives would have more 
rapid effects on greenhouse gas 
emissions than replacing fossil 
fuels with renewable energy. 
According to calculations made 
from Worldwatch Institute’s 
research, even if we were to 
eliminate fossil fuels entirely, 
we would still reach our 565 
gigaton CO2 emissions limit 
by 2030, just from the animal 
agriculture industry.

On a more positive note, 

cutting animal foods out of 
your diet would decrease your 
contribution 
to 
greenhouse 

gas emissions to one-seventh 
of what they were while eating 
meat. Even the United Nations 
has stated that “a global shift 
toward a vegan diet is vital to 
save the world from the worst 
impacts of climate change.”

Veganism is one of the most 

powerful tools we have for 
combatting 
climate 
change. 

Yet, 
from 
the 
University’s 

standpoint, it’s nothing but a 
personal dietary choice.

The U.S. government ignores 

the danger of animal foods 
because it has incomprehensible 
vested 
interest 
in 
the 

animal agriculture industry. 
Subsidies, 
legislation 
and 

regulation play a major role 
in our access to animal foods 
and are the only reason we 
can purchase them at such 
low prices, as is outlined by 
David Robinson Simon in his 
book “Meatonomics.”

It hurts my heart to believe 

that the University would turn 
a blind eye to the disastrous 
implications of the animal food 

industry for those same reasons.

To 
the 
environment’s 

detriment, 
the 
University’s 

sustainability 
and 
climate 

change efforts don’t mention 
veganism at all. For example, 
the University expresses a desire 
to “pursue energy efficiency 
and fiscally-responsible energy 
sourcing strategies to reduce 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 

toward 
long-term 
carbon 

neutrality.” To do this, it focuses 
on things like decreasing vehicle 
carbon output, even though 
a larger percentage of global 
greenhouse gas emissions is 
directly attributable to livestock 
production than is attributable 
to the entire transportation 
industry (according to United 
Nation’s Food and Agriculture 
Organization).

In another case, Planet Blue 

expresses a goal of purchasing 
more food from “local and 
sustainable sources,” but it fails 
to provide a comprehensive 
definition 
of 
“sustainable” 

other than stating the farming 
practices that it considers to 
be such. It would be helpful to 
understand how it determines 
if meat, eggs and dairy are 
sustainable; The New York 
Times notes that meat labeled 
as “sustainable” is often even 
worse for the environment. 
The word “vegan” is only 
mentioned in passing on the 
Planet Blue website and is 
never 
once 
mentioned 
on 

the website for the Graham 
Sustainability Institute.

The University has a unique 

position of power. If “reduced 
consumption of animal foods” 
was one of the school’s climate 
change goals, other institutions 
would likely follow suit. It 
could start a precedent of 
reducing climate change in the 
most effective way possible. 
The University truly has the 
opportunity to be the “Leader 
and the Best,” and yet, in what 
is arguably one of the most 
critical issues ever, it is settling 
for mediocrity.

DAILY LITERATURE COLUMN

LGBTQ writers & their 
place in literary cannon

Literature columnist Laura Dzubay explores the uneven 
patterns of sexual identity scattered across the literary canon

When you hear “Willa Cather,” 

you might think, “Oh yeah, I had to 
look up My Ántonia on SparkNotes 
in high school.” Or, if you’re a 
big literary fan, you might recall 
some of her other monumental 
and frontier-focused novels, “O 
Pioneers!,” “Song of the Lark” and 
“One of Ours.” Or maybe you’re just 
thinking, I’ve never heard of Willa 
Cather before today.

But one thing a lot of people 

aren’t aware of, even if they are 
familiar with her groundbreaking 
achievements in literature, is that 
Cather was likely a member of the 
LGBTQ community.

Of course, the idea of a famous 

writer being LGBTQ is hardly a 
groundbreaking one. So was Oscar 
Wilde, so were Arthur Rimbaud 
and Paul Verlaine, Allen Ginsberg, 
W. H. Auden — maybe even 
William Shakespeare, if you’re 
ever in the mood to go down that 
road. But what’s interesting about 
Cather — at least in part — is how 
long it took for the public to start 
admitting it.

I started down this path 

of discovery one day when I 
was bored and started reading 
famous people’s biographies on 
Wikipedia. On Willa Cather’s page, 
I scrolled through long passages 
about her life and career before 
stumbling across the information 
that during college, Cather often 
went by “William” and wore 
traditionally masculine clothes. 
Several of her works, including 
her early short story “Tommy, 
the 
Unsentimental,” 
seem 
to 

critique and discount traditional 
gender roles and conventions, and 
positively portray main characters 
who undermine them. Cather also 
seems to have had several same-
sex relationships, most notably 

with editor Edith Lewis, with 
whom she lived for the last thirty-
nine years of her life.

For some reason, though, the 

matter of whether or not Cather 
was lesbian, trans or otherwise 
queer is still a matter of much 
contention among scholars. Of 
course, Cather was also a very 
private person. She’s been dead 
for seventy years now and never 
explicitly came out during her 
lifetime, and my purpose here isn’t 
to make undue presumptions about 
her or to direct attention away 
from the quality of her writing 
itself. Rather, it is to make a point 
about LGBTQ writers in general, 
particularly 
female 
LGBTQ 

writers, and the ways in which they 
are represented (and omitted) in 
contemporary literary discussion.

For instance, remember the 

writers I listed a few paragraphs 
ago? You may have noticed that 
they’re all white men. I refer to 
them because they were the first 
people to come to my head, and even 
now I can’t think of any canonized 
LGBTQ writers to add to the list 
who aren’t either white, a man or 
both. By “canonized,” I mean non-
contemporary writers whose work 
is often taught, often anthologized, 
and considered deeply impactful to 
English literary traditions. I’m sure 
there are some, but there certainly 
aren’t enough for me to be able to 
think of them easily.

However, it must be added here 

that even gay white men draw the 
short straw when you put them 
up next to straight white men. Of 
those above, Rimbaud and Verlaine 
probably don’t count as canonical, 
and some secondary schools don’t 
even teach Wilde and Ginsberg 
due to concern from parents over 
subject matter. As for Shakespeare, 
I’ve 
seen 
people 
defend 
his 

straightness as vehemently as if 
they were defending their own.

So what’s the deal? Is there 

a dynamic in which a famous 
writer can be recognized either as 
influential and worth teaching or 
as queer, but not both? Cather is 
somewhat recognized in English 
literature, but even she is taught 
far less regularly than James 
Joyce, W. B. Yeats, and many of her 
other countless contemporaries. 
This is particularly surprising in 
American schools, where no doubt 
Cather’s profound and beautifully 
composed accounts of American 
frontier 
life 
and 
immigrant 

experiences are more relevant than 
European-set and focused works 
like Dubliners.

The 
web 
of 
LGBTQ 

representation 
in 
the 
writing 

world is a tangled one, but the 
list of LGBTQ writers who are 
considered “classic” begs some 
questions. Either there just weren’t 
that many queer writers until very 
recently, or (more likely) there 
have been a lot, who have been 
poorly represented in history. This 
is particularly true of writers of 
color and of female writers like 
Cather. They have always existed, 
but something has always been 
swept under the rug: their sexual 
or gender identity or their writing 
itself, and in some cases both.

Of course, the skewed leanings 

of the English literary canon where 
LGBTQ writers are concerned 
have been apparent for quite some 
time now, and Cather is only one 
example in a sea of others whose 
accomplishments and/or personal 
identities have been sidelined 
by the narrative of scholars over 
time. But it isn’t useful to simply 
complain about the way writers’ 
identities 
have 
been 
handled 

in the past; what is useful is to 
examine these patterns critically 
and to acknowledge the impact 
that LGBTQ writers have had on 
literary traditions, so that this 
subject may receive more attention 
in the future.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

If Lil Uzi Vert is setting the 
bar, rap today is having a very 
“post” moment.
The video for Uzi’s “XO Tour 
Llif3,” released Sept. 4, is, at the 
very least, post-cliché. There’s 
no discernible narrative and for 
over four minutes viewers are 
treated to a jumbled montage 
of a bejeweled Uzi dancing in 
post-apocalyptic scenes. The 
excessive use of blood, zombies 
and The Weeknd feels right, 
however, certainly compat-
ible with Uzi’s loaded career 
thus far. It’s the rapper’s — or 
“rock star’s” —latest display of 
his post-sadboy vulnerability 
machine, served with a side of 
post-trap/punk/middle finger-
blasting verve, and it all further 
adds to the brand.
Frequent Kanye West col-

laborator Virgil Abloh directs 
the video, which explains the 
traces of West’s now-iconic 
2007 “Stronger” video. The 
1980s-esque filters and bold 

Arabic subtitles are the most 
obvious parallels to Kanye’s 
Akira-alluding epic, and this 
time around shots of dismem-
bered bodies in a bathtub (first 

shown around the 1:14 mark) 
lend to the video’s post-punk 
feel. That’s not to mention Uzi’s 
trademark emo touch, seeping 
through in oversaturated and 
overstated purples.
The song itself, by now an 
absolute hit, touches on death, 
loneliness and life purpose, 
among other introspective 
crises rarely approached in this 
space. And Uzi complements 
the confessional with a so — 
wait for it — post-rap video 
that it excels more in aesthetic 
than substance. He’s beyond 
conventional rap spectacle, and 
such flirtation with this sort of 
rugged touchiness, even amidst 
some aesthetic confusion, is 
setting him apart day by day.

In a smooth debut, ‘Deuce’ 
outdoes our expectations

New HBO series wows in its storytelling and creative design

“The Deuce,” a new HBO period 

drama by David Simon (“The 
Wire”), delivers so much more 
than what its premise implies. 
The story revolves around the 
rise of the porn industry in 1971 
Manhattan — a plot that reeks of 
tasteless caricature and ostensibly 
formulaic storytelling. Like, do 
we really need more stories about 
Italian mobsters, sex and the ‘70s?

From 
the 
super-sized, 

84-minute 
pilot 
alone, 
“The 

Deuce” defies those expectations, 
displaying 
the 
gritty 
texture 

and Greek tragedy stylings of a 
character-driven morality tale. 
This is not a show about the 
intricacies of the porn industry per 
se. It’s a show about the humanity 
underlying 
the 
people 
who 

would become involved in such 
an industry, and how financial 
desperation and social ecosystems 
lead them to make brash, self-
contradictory decisions. 

Centered within the show’s 

version of New York’s seedy 
underbelly 
are 
two 
identical 

twin 
brothers, 
Vincent 
and 

Frankie Martino, both played 
wonderfully by James Franco 
(“The Interview”). While Vincent, 
a 
down-on-his-luck 
Brooklyn 

bartender, is given more screen 
time 
during 
the 
pilot 
than 

Frankie, 
an 
elusive 
gambler, 

Vincent’s 
knack 
for 
business 

offers a intriguing set-up for the 
episodes to come. When it comes 
to dramas, Franco is somewhat of 
an unpredictable actor (amazing 
in “127 Hours,” not so much in 
“Palo Alto”), and you’d think 
with a show like “The Deuce,” 
he would overact the hell out of 
his characters. Here, however, 
Franco disappears into the roles 
of Vincent and Frankie with 

finesse, distinguishing the two 
with charismatic ease and subtle 
dramatic flair.

In addition to Franco’s standout 

dual performance, the rest of the 
incredible ensemble cast deserve 
credit for making the most out 
of their absorbing characters. 
There are the ruthless pimps C.C. 
(Gary Carr, “Downton Abbey”) 
and 
Larry 
Brown 
(Gbenga 

Akinnagbe, “Detroit”); the forlorn 
prostitutes 
Candy 
(Maggie 

Gyllenhaal, “Frank”) and Darlene 
(Dominique Fishback, “Show Me 
a Hero”); and the 
ambitious 
college 

dropout 
Abby 

(Margarita Levieva, 
“The 
Blacklist”). 

Each of them are 
painted 
with 
the 

same 
amount 
of 

robust 
complexity 

and specificity: C.C. and Larry 
establish their friendship and 
business acumen through their 
punchy banter, Candy juggles her 
occupation 
with 
motherhood, 

Darlene quietly defies her boss and 
Abby harnesses her independence 
after deciding the college life isn’t 
for her. Even the more secondary 
characters, like new girl in 
town Lori (Emily Meade, “The 
Leftovers”) and her competition 
Ashley 
(newcomer 
Jamie 

Neumann), have some dimensions 
to them. And as disparate as their 
storylines are, they seamlessly 
interconnect with one another 
throughout the episode.

The theme of independent 

women 
being 
corrupted 
by 

abusive men is a prominent — and 
unfortunately relevant — part of 
“The Deuce,” especially in how 
the male characters attempt to 
dominate the female characters 
through toxic masculinity and 
the male gaze. The women, for 
the most part, are able to subdue 
their male counterparts through 

their own agency, such as when 
Candy explains the limitations 
of her practice with an overeager 
teenage 
customer 
or 
when 

Darlene asks her client to give her 
an advance for letting her watch 
“A Tale of Two Cities” with him 
during their usual session. 

Along 
with 
its 
colorful 

characters, 
“The 
Deuce” 

incorporates 
impeccable 

production 
values 
and, 
most 

importantly, a clear tone, mood 
and atmosphere. The visuals ooze 
with steely, cold blues, juxtaposing 

the darkness of 
the night scenes 
with the glowing 
artifice of Times 
Square, the show’s 
setting. 
There’s 

an 
obvious 

significance 
to 

this 
aesthetic 

contrast 
— 
the 
darkness 

embodying the corruption on the 
streets and in janky hotels versus 
the brightness and flashiness of 
the “rich and famous” lifestyle that 
the characters seek. But it’s shown 
with such rich astuteness, a clear 
indication of the brilliant artistry 
of Simon, cinematographer Pepe 
Avila del Pino (“Ozark”) and 
director 
Michelle 
MacLaren 

(“Breaking Bad”).

Granted, there’s some confusion 

during the episode about who’s 
who and what’s happening, a flaw 
that can easily be fixed as the story 
continues. The beauty of non-
expository dialogue and situations 
allows the audience to connect the 
dots on their own rather than have 
the writers do it for them. In fact, 
there isn’t even a single mention 
of the porn industry in the first 
episode. Instead of resorting 
to exploitation like it could, or 
crafting a simplistic, glamorous 
story for entertainment’s sake, 
“The Deuce” does its own thing 
and unapologetically so.

Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Thursday, Sept. 7 kicked off 

the start of New York Fashion 
Week, a biannual event where 
designers debut their collection 
for buyers and the press. New 
York fashion week is the first of 
the “Big Four”: London, Milan, 
and Paris host the remaining 
major fashion weeks.

Cushnie et Ochs
Cushnie 
et 
Ochs 
is 
an 

American 
fashion 
brand 

founded in 2008 by Parsons 
grads 
Carly 
Cushnie 
and 

Michelle Ochs. The brand prides 
itself on being a “By women, 
for women” and is famous 
for pieces with minimalistic 
sophistication with a seductive 

element.

Fashion has a problem with 

trying too hard, attempting to 
push the envelope at the cost of 
ultimately creating something 
creatively contrived and wholly 
un-clever. Cushnie et Ochs’s 
spring 
summer 
collection 

provided necessary relief from 
the over-designed collections 
that are all too frequent on 
the runways. The collection 
succeeded on simple silhouettes 
coupled with strong patterns.

Brandon Maxwell
Perhaps 
most 
famously 

known as Lady Gaga’s stylist, 
Brandon 
Maxwell 
launched 

his luxury women’s ready-to-
wear label in 2015. Maxwell’s 
transition from stylist to a 
designer has been well received 
by the fashion community; in 

the short period of time since 
his label launched, his designs 
have 
quickly 

become a favorite 
among 
icons 

such as Michelle 
Obama, Gwyneth 
Paltrow, Jennifer 
Aniston 
and 

more.

Still a relatively 

juvenile designer, 
Brandon Maxwell 
is 
steadily 

establishing 
himself as one 
of 
New 
York’s 

coolest 
by 

consistently 
offering up well 
designed 
collections. 
This 

runway show, only his fifth ever, 
was no exception. His women 

marched down the platform 
ready to seize and conquer, be 

it a boardroom 
or 
gala. 
 
His 

frequent use of 
angora knits was 
an untraditional 
textile choice for 
a spring summer 
collection, 
but 

the 
unorthodox 

fabric 
did 
not 

detract 
from 

the 
collection. 

The 
collection 

focused 
on 

vibrant, 
monochromatic, 
occasionally 
neon 
looks. 

Despite the harsh color scheme, 
his looks maintained an air of 
professionalism, well-matched 

with his intentions to “give 
something that our customer 
could wear to work, or to her 
friend’s house on the weekend.”

Christian Siriano
Christian 
Siriano 
is 

measurably the most successful 
“Project 
Runway” 
alum. 

In 
addition 
to 
owning 
an 

eponymous line, he sits on the 
Council of Fashion Designers 
of America, arguably the most 
prestigious fashion organization 
in the world. He has recently 
garnered applause for his more 
inclusive style of dressing.

Christian Siriano made a 

name for himself last year when 
he volunteered to dress Leslie 
Jones, of “SNL” fame, when 
no other designer would. This 
collection paid homage to that 
incident in two parts. First he 

invited Jones, who, according 
to 
Vogue, 
showed 
“raucous 

enthusiasm for each piece.” 
Second, he cast an array of body 
types in his show — something 
that should be neither shocking 
or rare, but unfortunately is. He 
didn’t draw much attention to 
this fact, however, and instead 
let the focus remain where it 
should be: on his clothes. His 
collection carried the energy 
of the room well, his designs 
all had an energy and a spark to 
them. Sometimes the liveliness 
derived from his electric choice 
of color and pattern and other 
times from sculptural elements. 
If you want to leave a party 
with a guarantee of not being 
forgotten, he’s a designer to 
turn to.

“Mario” is the latest from Ubisoft

The

handcuffed to the “Rayman” 
brand, some classic, really good 
game series or something that 
doesn’t sell anymore. Nowadays 
the Rabbids have hit the big 
time, starring in a crossover, 
Mario and the Rabbids, with the 
Mario characters — a very rare 
instance in which Nintendo 
allows a ‘B’ franchise to hang 
with the big boys. This game 
leaked a while back and nobody 
was all that excited for it.

Weirdly 
enough, 
though, 

my cynicism for this usually-
soulless series of products kind 
of has to end there. This is a good 
game, one that clearly has heart 
and soul packed into it. That 
was made clear in that famous 
video where director Davide 
Soliani 
became 
overcome 

with emotion at seeing living 
legend 
Shigeru 
Miyamoto 

talk about his project onstage 
at E3. Somehow, it seemed, 
Ubisoft made a Rabbids game 
not to exploit the characters’ 
marketability 
but 
because 

an artist actually developed 
passion for an idea.

That passion is immediately 

evident 
in 
this 
game’s 

animation. From the opening 
cutscene, it seems like more 
love is poured into each frame 
than usual. It’s hard to put 
a finger exactly on what’s 

changed, and using nouns like 
passion and love to describe 
in-game 
animations 
doesn’t 

get us far in doing so. But it just 
feels less soulless and grating 
than that of previous games 
like the Kinect and mobile swill 
Ubisoft used to churn out.

It is not hyperbolic to call this 

game “Duplo XCOM.” It is quite 
simply a watered-down version 
of XCOM’s famous turn-based, 
squad-based strategy gameplay. 
A team of Mario characters and 
Rabbids dressed up like Mario 
characters arrange themselves 
on a battlefield and take shots 
at baddies with cartoon-y laser 
guns. There’s an extremely 
simple cover system, which 
strips some of the nuance from 
how XCOM calculated aim 
values (shots hit 0 percent, 

50 percent or 100 percent of 
the time, which kind of takes 
away the thrill of gambling on a 
risky shot). Enemy types evolve 
nicely, if a teensy bit slowly, 
over the course of the game, 
which forces the player to 
change up their strategies and 
keeps gameplay fresh.

There 
is, 
of 
course, 
no 

permadeath 
in 
“Kingdom 

Battle,” a hallmark feature 
of 
the 
XCOM 
series 
that 

obviously wouldn’t make sense 
in 
Nintendo’s 
kid-friendly 

universe. Instead, the game’s 
battles come with a rather 
annoying 
rating 
system, 

encouraging 
the 
player 
to 

complete missions with a full 
party remaining in order to 
be granted more coins for 
their victory. However, where 
XCOM is designed to actively 
encourage continuation after 
losses and toys with the players’ 
emotional attachments to their 
party members in a meaningful, 

effective way, there’s no reason 
to press on in “Kingdom Battle” 
after a pyrrhic victory. It’s 
super easy to just reload the 
encounter, and the weapons 
bought with the extra coins 
are so valuable that not getting 
them makes you feel under-
equipped for future fights.

The highlights of this game 

are the boss battles. They’re 
incredibly diverse and are often 
good digressions from the way 
fights typically work. One in 
particular takes the form of a 
musical, complete with lyrics 
written by Grant Kirkhope, 
the renowned British game 
composer 
that 
penned 
the 

“DK Rap” we all sing along to 
in DK64, Melee and the opera 
from “Conker’s Bad Fur Day.” 
It’s cute.

Speaking of Kirkhope, the 

man puts in soundtrack work 
here that is beautiful, fitting, 
and extremely nostalgic, giving 
reverence to Nintendo classics 
while coming up with a few 
new classics of his own. Some 
of the melodies aren’t distinct 
enough, though — they feel 
a little wandering, and I left 
the game with merely a few 
earworms to hum. Let me be 
clear that the only reason I 
feel comfortable giving such 
an unfair criticism to a great 
soundtrack is that Kirkhope 
has the power to make every 
single song in a video game a 
memorable classic (see: both 
Banjo-Kazooie 
games). 
He 

didn’t quite do that here.

One more small criticism: 

Playing 
this 
game 
on 
the 

Switch’s 
Tablet 
Mode 
isn’t 

ideal. The proportions of the 
characters to the map, the 
hugely restrictive camera and 
the mediocre UI make it so 
the TV version is much more 
manageable. It’s definitely not a 
deal-breaker, but you’ll want to 
play this one at home more than 
you take it on the go.

Regardless, this game is 

still a great B-tier release and 
decent satiation for Nintendo 
fans at the end of a Summer 
quite starved for new Switch 
games, Rabbids (and Minions) 
be damned.

Still searching

Michigan’s defense knows 
its identity. The same can’t 
be said for the offense, and 
that’s becoming a problem.

The arrival
Donovan Peoples-Jones 
finally had his moment, 
returning a punt for 79 
yards and scoring the first 
touchdown of his career.

One week later, and the boos 

rained down once again.

Yikes.
This time, they came in the 

third quarter after a failed 
draw play on 3rd-and-goal from 
the eight-yard line. Air Force 
signaled it was blitzing, and 
it did, stuffing Ty Isaac in the 
backfield. Michigan’s offense 
trotted off the field, Quinn 
Nordin and the field goal unit 
trotted onto it and the crowd 
expressed its displeasure.

It was that type of day for the 

seventh-ranked 
Wolverines, 

who struggled to a 29-13 win 
over the Falcons.

The spread was 23 points. 

Michigan, 
though, 
certainly 

proved that Las Vegas is no 
expert — thanks to occasionally 
sloppy execution by the offense.

What could have seemed 

like an outlier compared to 
previous 
seasons 
has 
now 

become a very real trend. The 
Wolverines have entered the 
red zone 10 times this year, and 
have only one touchdown to 
show for it. Saturday, Michigan 
had the ball in the red zone 

four times. And while it didn’t 
exit completely empty-handed, 
kicking four field goals, the lack 
of touchdowns kept Air Force 
in the game.

Michigan 
outgained 
the 

Falcons, 359 to 232. But that 
didn’t matter as much when the 
Wolverines were putting only 
three on the board instead of 
seven.

The 
Falcons 
— 
true 
to 

their reputation and riding a 
seven-game 
winning 
streak 

— performed admirably. With 
their flexbone offense, they 
ground away at the Wolverines. 
Several 
nifty 
plays, 
good 

decision-making 
from 
their 

quarterback, Arion Worthman, 
and stout defense helped Air 
Force stay close with Michigan.

“We knew they were going 

to be fundamentally sound and 
really smart players, which 
obviously 
they 
were,” 
said 

redshirt 
junior 
quarterback 

Wilton Speight, who completed 
14-of-23 passes for 169 yards. 
“They were doing a really good 
job of disguising coverages, 
disguising blitzes. Oftentimes 
in the red zone they’d show one 
thing until the last second and 
then they’d bring another look 
or they’d bring the house. 

“We were making in-game 

adjustments. I was talking to 
Coach Pep (Hamilton) on the 
phone a lot, talking with Coach 
Harbaugh as well. Just trying 
to adjust on the fly like they 
were doing the entire game.”

The 

Wolverines 
came 
out 

of 
the 
gate 

determined 
to 
throw, 

beginning their 
opening 
drive 

with 
three 

consecutive 
passes. 
Their 

first run play 
nearly resulted 
in a touchdown 
when 
Isaac 

made 
a 
nifty 

cut 
and 

rumbled down 
the 
sideline 

before stepping 
out of bounds. 
The drive eventually sputtered 
at Air Force’s 17-yard line, and 
Nordin knocked in the first of a 
record-tying five field goals.

After Air Force was forced to 

punt, Michigan seemed on its 
way to moving the ball down 
the field again. Sophomore 

running back Chris Evans, 
though, fumbled on the ensuing 
possession, and the Falcons tied 
the game with a 37-yard field 
goal from Luke Strebel after a 
glacial 12-play, 24-yard drive 
that took 6:13 off the clock.

The Wolverines 

used 
a 
pair 
of 

explosive plays — 
a 37-yard screen 
pass to freshman 
receiver Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
and 
a 
30-yard 

catch-and-
run 
by 
redshirt 

sophomore 
tight 

end Zach Gentry 
— to move down 
the field on their 
third 
drive. 
But 

the red zone issues 
continued, 
and 

Michigan 
was 

forced to turn to 
Nordin 
for 
his 

second field goal.

The Falcons would counter 

quickly. They marched down 
the field, gaining 42 yards, 
before 
their 
own 
offense 

faltered in opposing territory — 
apparently the theme of the day 
on both sides — and Strebel hit 
a 50-yarder.

A poor punt by Air Force did 

give Michigan enviable field 
position on its final possession 
of the half. But it ended with a 
familiar sight: Nordin and the 
field goal unit trotting out for 
a 49-yarder that gave Michigan 
an uncomfortable three-point 
lead headed into halftime.

It appeared the Wolverines 

were ready to pull away at 
the start of the third quarter. 
Peoples-Jones 
zig-zagged 

his way past Air Force’s punt 
coverage unit for a 79-yard 
touchdown. 

“My punt return team did a 

great job of blocking,” Peoples-
Jones said, “and they made my 
job very easy.” 

The 
Falcons 
countered 

quickly, 
though. 
After 

attempting only two passes up 
until that point, they caught 
the 
Wolverines’ 
secondary 

off guard and connected on a 
64-yard touchdown strike to 
Ronald Cleveland.

Michigan’s 
next 
two 

possessions 
began 
on 
Air 

Force’s side of the field — 
and both resulted in Nordin 
celebrating with his teammates 
after his third and fourth field 
goals.

After a 12-play, 73-yard drive, 

the Falcons seemed poised to 
make things interesting by 
cutting it to a one-score game. 
But the Wolverines kept Air 
Force out of the end zone and 
then caught a break when 
Strebel missed a 29-yard field 
goal wide left, preserving their 
tenuous nine-point lead. And 
with just over a minute left, 
the offense finally iced the 
game when junior running back 
Karan Higdon bounced a run 
outside and took it 36 yards to 
the house. 

The 16-point win seemed to 

be another unsettling effort 
from a team with serious 
postseason 
expectations. 

Yet Jim Harbaugh remained 
unfazed after the game, saying 
that he is “happy” with the 
offense thus far — with the 
offensive line, the running 
backs and his quarterback. 

Happiness aside, a continued 

inability to score touchdowns 
in the red zone could prove 
disastrous for Michigan.

But Harbaugh doesn’t think 

that’ll remain the case for much 
longer.

“Our team is moving the ball, 

that’s a fact,” Harbaugh said. “I 
think the red zone touchdowns 
will come.”

An identity crisis

K

aran Higdon paused for 
a moment when he was 
asked the question. 

If you had to sum up your 

offense in one word, one sentence, 
how would you describe it right 
now?

The 

Wolverines’ 
sophomore 
running 
back had just 
scored the 
Michigan 
football 
team’s sole 
offensive 
touchdown 
in a 29-13 
victory over Air Force that 
was far closer than the score 
indicated.

It was a rough day at the office 

for the offense, which entered 
the red zone four times and 
didn’t come away with a single 
touchdown. It’s not an anomaly, 
either. The Wolverines have 
converted on only one of their 
10 red zone opportunities this 
season.

Higdon’s 36-yard rush — a 

break to the outside that turned 
into a foot race to the end zone 
with just over a minute left in 
the game — was the singular 
exclamation point. 

And yet, it’s not really the 

discrepancies in production 
between Michigan’s offensive 
and defensive units that are the 
problem. 

So: If you had to sum up your 

offense in one word, one sentence, 
how would you describe it right 
now?

“Courageous,” Higdon 

finally said. “Our offense is very 
courageous. Don’t give up and 
we won’t be denied, no matter 
what happens in a game. And I 
think we believe in each other, 
we have faith in each other 
and we know that we’re gonna 
come around and make things 

happen.”

But those things haven’t 

happened yet.

Later, Higdon admitted that 

Michigan shot itself in the foot 
on multiple occasions. It did.

He admitted that the 

Wolverines need to get back to 
the drawing board. They do.

And he admitted that the 

Wolverines’ offensive unit is 
still searching for its identity. 
Undoubtedly.

Higdon has an idealistic vision 

of what Michigan’s offense could 
be. He said the Wolverines have 
shown flashes of it, and he’s not 
wrong.

The first score against Florida, 

which ended in a 46-yard 
touchdown pass to freshman 
receiver Tarik Black, was a flash.

The opening drive against 

Cincinnati, which ended in 
43-yard touchdown pass to 
sophomore receiver Kekoa 
Crawford, was a flash.

And the multiple touchdown 

rushes by fifth-year senior Ty 
Isaac that have been called back? 
Those are flashes, too.

On Saturday, Higdon looked to 

the future, painting a picture of 
what his unit’s identity could be.

“I think we’re great,” he said. 

“I think we’re physical. I think 
we know ourselves, we’re gonna 
play hard, we’re determined and 
we won’t be denied.”

The problem is that they have 

been denied plenty of times. The 
flashes don’t create an identity, 
and the Wolverines are still in 
need of one.

I don’t mean to suggest that 

Michigan should be perfect 
already. But we still don’t know 
what makes Michigan’s offense, 
well, Michigan’s offense.

That’s a problem. Michigan 

has a playoff-caliber defense, 
and right now, it looks like its 
offense might waste it. 

The Wolverines’ young 

defensive unit attacked Air 
Force’s triple option, and barring 
the Falcons’ 64-yard touchdown 
pass in the third quarter, they 
were successful.

Through three games, 

Michigan is allowing an average 
of 14.7 points, 82.3 rushing yards 
and 125.7 passing yards. The 
Wolverines have surrendered 
just two touchdowns, while 
scoring three of their own.

On Saturday, sophomore 

linebacker Devin Bush Jr. said 
the defensive unit is starting 
to reveal “who we are, who we 
want to be.” Taken at face value, 
it would appear Michigan’s 
offense and defense are each 
progressing simultaneously.

But it’s in the subtle 

statements that it becomes clear 
the Wolverines’ defense is miles 
ahead of their counterpart.

When you’re stuffing them on 

the run like that, do you feel like 
nobody can run the ball on you 
guys?

“Nobody can run the ball on 

us,” he said. “Nobody.”

And again.
You mentioned their offense 

being almost annoying to face, 
does that make it more fun to 

blow a play up when you do get a 
chance to do that?

“Just to stop what they love to 

do,” he said. “It’s always a good 
feeling.”

And again.
Is that the identity of this team, 

the defense helping the offense 
along?

“Yeah, that’s how it should 

be,” he said. “Championship. 
Let’s get it.”

It’s Bush’s unbridled 

confidence that makes this much 
clear: The defense knows who it 
is. They are confident, with the 
appropriate touch of arrogance. 
They find pleasure in ruining 
another team’s Saturday. They 
know — and are not intimidated 
by — the likelihood that, as of 
Saturday night, this team will go 
as far as the defense can take it.

There’s nothing wrong with 

that collective identity — a team 
that thrives on the defensive end 
while its offense does enough. 
Plenty of championship-caliber 
programs have succeeded 
under the same model. You 
don’t need to look further than 
when Jim Harbaugh was in the 
NFL with San Francisco. From 
2011 to 2013, the 49ers went to 
two conference championships 
and a Super Bowl with Colin 
Kaepernick or Alex Smith as 
their quarterback. Their defense 
ranked fourth, third and fifth in 
the NFL.

The NFL is a low-scoring 

league. Comparatively, each 
of last year’s College Football 
Playoff contenders averaged at 
least 38 points. The Wolverines 
don’t need to be that, but they 
certainly need to be better.

But right now, Michigan’s 

offense doesn’t know what to 
hang its hat on. And the time to 
play catch up is over.

Looking down the road

I 

imagine Purdue fans were 
smiling if they found 
themselves watching 

the Michigan football team’s 
matchup with Air Force.

Sure, the seventh-ranked 

Wolverines won, 29-13, and 
remained 
undefeated, 
but they had 
to endure 
another 
unsettling 
afternoon. 
Barely 
beating a 
so-called 
‘inferior’ 
opponent 
doesn’t bode 
well when three top-10 teams 
remain on the schedule.

The Big Ten season starts 

away at Purdue next weekend, 
and the Boilermakers have 
plenty of reasons to be 

optimistic about their chances of 
upending Michigan.

After all, the Wolverines have 

been the ones struggling. Their 
upcoming opponents have not.

Purdue (1-1) handled No. 

14 Louisville well on opening 
weekend, losing by only a 
touchdown. The week after that, 
the Boilermakers whooped Ohio, 
44-21.

Just up the road, Michigan 

State is 2-0 with a pair of 
comfortable wins.

Meanwhile, No. 5 Penn State 

(2-0) is crushing every team 
in its path. The Nittany Lions 
won their first two games by 
a combined score of 85-14. To 
be fair, they played Akron and 
Pittsburgh. To be fair again, 
Michigan has played Cincinnati 
and Air Force. Those four teams 
aren’t much different.

In Madison, the 10th-ranked 

Badgers (2-0) keep winning as 

well.

And of course: No. 8 Ohio 

State (1-1). If Michigan can’t 
find a solution to its offensive 
struggles, taking down 
quarterback J.T. Barrett and 
the Buckeyes at the end of the 
season is not going to be easy. 
The consequences of the Ohio 
State game might not even 
matter if the struggles keep 
repeating.

Nonetheless, amidst all the 

criticism, the coaches and 
players have remained positive. 
They don’t express much 
concern in front of the media, 
but in reality, there is concern to 
be had.

Relying on the defense and 

special teams isn’t going to get 
them very far in conference play. 
The team knows it, too.

“We know (the defense is) 

top tier, and we know they’re 
going to do their job,” said junior 

running back Karan Higdon. 
“We still got to do our job as an 
offense. … We got to do our part 
and not make it as hard on the 
defense.”

Fixing the mistakes doesn’t 

fall on one player, either. 
Criticizing redshirt junior 
quarterback Wilton Speight 
would be easy, but it’s really the 
entire offensive unit that has 
struggled to produce.

They’re moving the ball 

downfield well — Speight 
threw for 169 yards and the 
team gained 190 yards on the 
ground — but when they get into 
a scoring situation, something 
isn’t clicking.

Michigan didn’t score an 

offensive touchdown against Air 
Force until there was a minute 
left in the game.

It was the same story as last 

week, the same struggle we 
saw against Cincinnati. The 

Wolverines have scored only one 
touchdown on 10 red zone trips 
this season.

Air Force handed Michigan 

chances, too. Two botched punts 
gave the Wolverines starting 
field position in Air Force 
territory, and both of those 
times Michigan had to settle for 
field goals.

They were the type of 

scenarios that a great offense 
would capitalize on, but 
Michigan’s wasn’t up to the task.

“If you’ve ever been on a 

football field, and one side might 
not be going right, it’s easy to 
point fingers,” said redshirt 
junior defensive end Chase 
Winovich. “Great teams don’t 
do that, even if something isn’t 
coming along as much as you 
like.”

At the end of the day, 

Michigan came out victorious, 
and the Wolverines still hold a 

perfect record. But after beating 
Florida, it seemed like it would 
be smooth sailing until a trip to 
Happy Valley in late October. 
The real test shouldn’t have 
started until they played Penn 
State.

Now it’s clear, the test 

has already started, and the 
Wolverines have managed to 
escape back-to-back scares.

“If one guy makes a hiccup, 

it can cost the whole offense,” 
Higdon said.

When an entire offense has 

the hiccups, though, it could 
cost Michigan a win.

With the Big Ten season now 

upon them, we’re about to find 
out what really happens when 
the Wolverines get punched in 
the mouth.

Five Things We Learned: Air Force

What’s the first rule about 

playing Air Force?

Never play Air Force.
No. 8 Michigan slogged its way 

to a mostly unsatisfying 29-13 win 
over the Falcons on Saturday. The 
Wolverines did well in shutting 
down Air Force’s triple-option 
attack. But their own offense 
struggled to convert deep in 
Falcon territory, settling for a field 
goal on all four trips into the red 
zone.

Here are five things we learned 

from Saturday’s game:

1. Ty Isaac is a home-run 

hitter

It didn’t take long for the fifth-

year senior to wrest the starting 

running back job away from Chris 
Evans — only one week, to be exact. 
And Isaac hasn’t showed any signs 
of slowing down, either. He’s 
been Michigan’s most consistent 
runner and is a constant threat to 
break a long run.

Against Air Force, he had two 

that were this close to going the 
distance — a 32-yarder in the first 
quarter that displayed impressive 
burst, and a 26-yarder in the third 
that would’ve been a touchdown 
had sophomore receiver Kekoa 
Crawford not been flagged for 
holding.

On the season, Evans and 

Higdon are averaging 3.7 and 4.6 
yards per carry. Isaac, meanwhile, 
is averaging 7.1, and last week, The 
Athletic ranked him the 26th most 
efficient runner in the nation. 
He’s been a significant difference-
maker out of the backfield, and 

if the injury he suffered late 
in Saturday’s game is serious, 
Michigan’s run game will suffer.

2. 
Don 
Brown 
remains 

unstoppable

Michigan’s 
defensive 

coordinator may find his name 
in conversations for the Broyles 
Award — given to the nation’s best 
assistant coach — at the end of 
the season. He’s taken a relatively 
inexperienced unit and kept it 
running just as smoothly as last 
year’s historically elite defense.

That’s 
nothing 
short 
of 

remarkable.

On Saturday, Air Force — 

which had won seven straight 
games — was the latest team to 
run into Brown’s buzzsaw of a 
defense. Aside from one big bust 
in the passing game that went for 

a 64-yard touchdown, Michigan 
shut down the Falcons. Air Force 
ran the ball 49 times for just 168 
yards — 3.4 yards per carry. That 
was its second-lowest rushing 
output since 2014.

Brown could have his hands 

full next week with a rejuvenated 
Purdue 
attack 
led 
by 
new 

coach Jeff Brohm and veteran 
quarterback David Blough. But, 
given the results up to this point, 
does anyone doubt that he’ll have 
the defense ready to go?

3. Success with the ‘VIPER’

Khaleke Hudson hasn’t played 

offense. 
He 
hasn’t 
returned 

punts or kicks, either. Those are 
components of Jabrill Peppers’ 
game that Hudson will probably 
never be able to replicate. What the 
sophomore has done, though, is fill 

in capably at the ‘VIPER’ position, 
perhaps the most important spot 
in Don Brown’s defense.

Hudson, who played safety in 

high school, has been stout against 
the run. He’s also been a pleasant 
surprise in defending the pass. 
Against Air Force, he covered a 
deep route comfortably, knocking 
the ball to the ground. And his 
most impressive play in coverage 
wasn’t even his first recorded 
interception, which came late 
on a desperate heave from Air 
Force’s Nate Romine — it was an 
unsuccessful attempt at a pick, 
when Hudson nearly snagged a 
pass with one hand.

He doesn’t wear No. 5. But 

Saturday’s disruptive performance 
may have reminded some viewers 
of the last ‘VIPER’ Michigan had.

4. The 3-3-5 is here to stay

Michigan has spent most of 

its first three games in the new 
3-3-5 stack formation that was 
debuted 
against 
then-No. 
17 

Florida. It doesn’t matter what 
type of offense the Wolverines 
have faced — their new scheme 
has successfully thrown off all of 
their opponents.

It shut down Air Force’s lethally 

efficient flexbone option Saturday, 
it shut down Cincinnati’s mess 
of an offense last week and it 
destroyed Doug Nussmeier’s pro-
style, zone-blocking scheme in the 
opener.

Most importantly, Michigan 

still retains the flexibility to switch 
back to its more conventional 
4-2-5 look. Redshirt junior nose 
guard Bryan Mone, who is subbed 
out in favor of redshirt junior SAM 
linebacker Noah Furbush in the 
3-3-5, is still strong enough to take 
on double teams and beat single 
blockers. That may come in handy 
against heftier pro-style attacks 
such as Wisconsin, and being 
able to successfully employ both 
schemes may help the Wolverines 
confuse Penn State and Ohio 
State’s no-huddle spread attacks, 

as well.

5. 
BOLD 
PREDICTION: 

Devin Bush Jr. will be an All-
American

Michigan’s lightning bolt of a 

linebacker stood out once again, 
leading the team with 11 tackles 
Saturday. The sophomore is now 
on pace to finish the regular season 
with 18 tackles-for-loss and 14 
sacks. What may be scarier for 
opponents is that the stats aren’t 
a fluke. Bush has simply been that 
good, and in Brown’s scheme, 
which favors constant blitzes from 
the linebackers, it would be unwise 
to expect him to slow down.

Bush’s unique blend of speed, 

explosiveness and tackling makes 
him the complete package in the 
middle of the defense, and if he 
continues to pile up stats, the rest 
of college football will be sure to 
take notice — if it hasn’t already.

The good, the bad and the ugly

For an undefeated team, No. 8 

Michigan (3-0) hasn’t looked all 
that convincing.

Another Saturday into the 

2017 season and the Wolverines 
still haven’t presented a clear 
picture of who they are and 
what they are capable of this 
year. After double-digit wins 
over Florida and Cincinnati 
that left much to be desired, 
Michigan fell victim to the same 
fate against Air Force.

The defense carried the load 

while the offense struggled to 
find a groove, but the Wolverines 
managed to capture yet another 
victory. The Daily breaks down 
the good, the bad and the ugly 
from Saturday’s 29-13 win.

The good

Michigan’s defense may have 

faced its toughest task of the 
year Saturday when the Falcons 
and their complex triple-option 
scheme rolled into town, but 
their performance didn’t show 
it.

Air Force rushed the ball a 

whopping 49 times, but gained a 
measly 168 yards — an average of 
3.4 yards per carry. Though the 
Falcons tried to pound the ball 
down the Wolverines’ throat, 
Michigan controlled the line of 
scrimmage from start to finish.

Air Force’s pass game fared 

much 
worse. 
The 
Falcons 

attempted nine passes. They 
completed only one.

That one pass resulted in 

Air Force’s only touchdown of 
the game. Junior safety Tyree 
Kinnel was caught off guard at 
the snap and Air Force receiver 
Ronald Cleveland got the jump 
on him. Cleveland caught the 
ball in motion and sprinted 64 
yards across the field. Kinnel 
couldn’t recover in time to catch 
him before he reached the end 
zone.

The Wolverines terrorized 

Falcon 
quarterback 
Arion 

Worthman 
all 
day, 
sacking 

him three times and forcing 
a fumble. With the amount of 
hard hits he took in the contest, 
Worthman would have needed 
to take a long ice bath Saturday 
night.

The linebacker unit earned 

top marks, as senior Mike 
McCray and sophomore Devin 
Bush Jr. each tallied 11 tackles. 
The ends weren’t far behind 
in that race, as redshirt junior 
Chase Winovich and sophomore 
Rashan Gary recorded nine and 
six tackles, respectively.

After 
a 
mistake-riddled 

outing 
against 
Cincinnati, 

the special teams unit also 

got back on track against Air 
Force, 
courtesy 
of 
redshirt 

freshman kicker Quinn Nordin 
and freshman receiver Donovan 
Peoples-Jones.

Nordin had a perfect day, 

nailing all five of his field goals 
to notch a career high and equal 
a 
program 
record. 
Peoples-

Jones, for his part, provided 
the highlight of the day with a 
79-yard punt return touchdown. 
It was Michigan’s first trip into 
the end zone, and it gave the 
Wolverines the breathing room 
they desperately needed.

The bad

Though 
disastrous 
pick-

sixes and fumbles were placed 
firmly in the rearview mirror, 

Michigan’s 
offense 
didn’t 

look 
particularly 
impressive 

Saturday.

Coming into the matchup, 

Air Force’s offense seemed to 
be of principal concern to the 
Wolverines. But with the way 
the game panned out, they 
should have been warier of the 
Falcons’ defense.

Redshirt junior quarterback 

Wilton Speight completed 14 of 
23 attempts for 169 yards, but 
he couldn’t seem to connect 
on the most important passes. 
Michigan found its way into 
the red zone four times, yet 
not once did the Wolverines 
come away with a touchdown. 
After the game, Speight said Air 
Force disguised its blitzes really 
well, holding its positioning 
until he called for the snap, and 
therefore making it difficult for 
him to pick up on the scheme.

Even Michigan’s run game, 

which had proved to be a steady 
force in its first two games, 
looked relatively contained by 
the Falcons’ game plan. Fifth-
year senior running back Ty 
Isaac came closest to scoring, 
but both times he reached the 
end zone, the play was called 
back.

The ugly

The score at halftime was 9-6. 

For a football game, that’s never 
a good sign.

While it may have been nice 

for Nordin and Air Force kicker 
Luke Strebel to go mano-a-
mano in a quasi-kick-off, neither 
offense will enjoy watching 
the tape of their first-half 
performance — just as the crowd 
of 111,387 at Michigan Stadium 
probably didn’t enjoy watching 
it in person.

With both teams unable to 

find the end zone, the most 
exciting plays of the first half 
were a 50-yard field goal from 
Strebel and a 49-yarder from 
Nordin. But even “exciting” 
would be generous.

The Daily breaks down what went right, and what went 

wrong, for the Wolverines in their win Saturday afternoon.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Peoples-Jones marks his arrival

One 
foot 
made 
all 
the 

difference.

It wasn’t that of redshirt 

freshman kicker Quinn Nordin, 
who nailed a career-best five field 
goals to tie a school record. And it 
wasn’t that of fifth-year senior Ty 
Isaac, who broke through the line 
of scrimmage and made it all the 
way into the end zone before the 
officials called him back, stating 
that he had stepped out of bounds.

Though there will certainly 

be arguments to the contrary, 
Nordin’s 17 points and Isaac’s near-
touchdown paled in comparison 
to the left foot of freshman 
receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones. 
For the No. 7 Michigan football 
team, which led Air Force by just 
three halfway through the game, 
Peoples-Jones made the play of 
the game Saturday. And to think, 
it almost never happened.

Peoples-Jones, lined up to 

receive the punt, watched eagerly 
as the ball soared through the air. 
While backpedaling nearly 10 
yards, he never took his eye off it. 
As it corralled into his grasp, he 
immediately turned on the jets.

He ran 30 yards to his left, 

sliced across the painted ‘M’ in 
the middle of the field and headed 
toward the right sideline. There 
was only one Falcon left in his 
path with 20 yards to go.

Peoples-Jones faked to his left, 

and while he gained just enough 
separation to run around Air 
Force punter Charlie Scott, Scott 
followed his cut and managed to 
put both hands on Peoples-Jones 
at the very edge of the sideline.

The freshman’s right foot hung 

just shy of the sideline, but he 
came down with his left. He had 
shaken off Scott, and the contact 
kept him balanced just long 
enough to bring his left foot down 
inside the sideline. The final 15 
yards was easy.

With a 79-yard touchdown — 

Michigan’s first of the game and 
its first via punt return by a true 

freshman since 2008 — Peoples-
Jones gave the Wolverines a 
double-digit lead only one minute 
into the second half.

“I mean, it just opened up like 

the Red Sea,” Peoples-Jones said. 
“... (The punt return team) did a 
great job of blocking, not holding, 
and made my job pretty easy.”

There 
had 
been 
much 

anticipation ahead of People-
Jones’ first punt return of the day 
after the freshman receiver had 
been benched halfway through 
the Wolverines’ previous game 
against Cincinnati.

He only made one true error. 

But at his position, one mistake can 
lead to disastrous consequences.

In the case of Peoples-Jones, 

he kept making that same mistake 
over and over again. And against 
the Bearcats, it cost him dearly.

Just eight minutes into the 

first quarter, Michigan held a 
comfortable 14-0 lead. With the 
Wolverines riding high after 
junior safety Tyree Kinnel’s pick-
six, all Peoples-Jones had to do 
was call for a fair catch.

Instead, he watched as the 

Cincinnati punt soared through 
the air, heading straight toward 
him. If he had signaled for a 
fair catch, maybe his main 
blocker, freshman defensive back 
Benjamin St-Juste, would have 
stopped running. While it’s no 
guarantee, Peoples-Jones might 
have been able to prevent what 
happened next.

St-Juste wasn’t even looking 

at the ball when it bounced off 
him and right into the path of an 
oncoming 
Bearcat. 
Cincinnati 

took over possession at the 

Wolverines’ 38-yard line and 
scored 
its 
first 
touchdown 

minutes later to cut Michigan’s 
lead in half.

Thinking 
Peoples-Jones 

had learned from his mistake, 
coach Jim Harbaugh gave him 
another chance. But when he 
was hammered by a Bearcat 
immediately 
after 
controlling 

another punt, Harbaugh had 
enough. Peoples-Jones didn’t see 
the field again that day.

Saturday, Peoples-Jones was 

all over the field. He called for 
fair catches when they were 
necessary, 
returned 
another 

punt for 25 yards, and caught two 
passes — the first two receptions 
of his career — for 52 yards, 
including a 37-yard connection 
with redshirt junior quarterback 
Wilton Speight.

“I think you saw Donovan 

settle in a little bit today and 
realize what he’s truly capable of,” 
Speight said.

Though Peoples-Jones — the 

No. 1 receiver in the 2017 class 
— has taken a backseat to fellow 
freshman Tarik Black so far, he 
took center stage on Saturday. 
And there could be much more of 
him in store.

“We’re giving a lot of thought 

to using Donovan in a lot of ways,” 
Harbaugh said. “... I think you’re 
gonna see him grow, grow, grow. 
He’s been plus, plus, plus, so (it’s) 
great to see.

“I feel like great things will 

happen for Donovan Peoples-
Jones.”

After reaching the end zone, 

Peoples-Jones motioned toward 
the 
student 
section, 
raising 

his arms high above his head. 
With more students still in 
attendance than what may have 
been expected after halftime in 
a game where neither team had 
scored a touchdown, the section 
responded in kind, bouncing with 
more energy than it had shown all 
game.

The scene on both sides made 

one thing abundantly clear. 

Peoples-Jones had arrived.

‘M’ defense passes another test

Nate Romine let the pass 

loose from Michigan’s 48-yard 
line.

The 
Air 
Force 
reserve 

quarterback 
was 
facing 

pressure, and with the Falcons 
trailing by 16 with under a 
minute left, he took a shot 
downfield.

It 
was 
an 
ill-advised 

decision.

The pass turned into a jump 

ball, and Michigan linebacker 
Khaleke 
Hudson 
won 
that 

battle — rising up to snatch the 
ball out of the air and seal the 
seventh-ranked 
Wolverines’ 

third win of the season.

Redshirt junior quarterback 

Wilton 
Speight 
took 
over, 

taking a knee to milk the final 
19 seconds off the clock.

But for the third time in as 

many games, it was Michigan’s 
defense 
that 
provided 
the 

exclamation point on a victory.

Against 
Florida, 
redshirt 

junior defensive end Chase 
Winovich sacked Malik Zaire 
in the end zone before senior 
linebacker 
Noah 
Furbush 

corralled the loose ball for a 
touchdown.

Against 
Cincinnati, 

sophomore cornerback Lavert 
Hill’s pick-six put the game to 
bed in the final five minutes.

And against Air Force, there 

was Hudson’s interception.

It’s 
no 
secret 
that 
the 

Wolverines’ defensive unit has 
been the highlight of what has 
been an oddly unconvincing 
three weeks of undefeated 
football. The alarming fact 
is that Winovich thinks the 
performances up to this point 
are just the “tip of the iceberg.” 
And 
against 
the 
Falcons, 

Winovich and the defensive 
unit took another step forward.

Michigan faced the triple 

option 
— 
an 
offense 
that 

sophomore linebacker Devin 
Bush Jr. described as a “whole 
other world” — with a unit 
composed primarily of players 
making their third college 
start.

“It’s harder because you 

gotta stay in your gap,” Bush 
said after the game. “You can’t 
get washed out, you can’t get 
washed down. You can’t fall, 
miss a block or miss attacking 
your gap. It’s way harder when 
you have to do a certain job 
and not make 
the play, but 
do 
your 
job 

to 
help 
your 

teammates be 
great.”

They 
did 

their job well.

While 

the 
Falcons 

amassed 
232 

yards, 
those 

were primarily 
the result of a 
high 
volume 

of carries: Air 
Force ran the 
ball 49 times, but averaged just 
3.4 yards per carry.

The passing game didn’t fare 

much better. Earlier this week, 
Bush had warned of such.

“They’re not going to pass 

the ball too many times,” 

he said. “If they do, we got 
something for ‘em.”

He was right. The Falcons 

threw the ball just nine times. 
One pass was picked off. Seven 
of the attempts fell incomplete. 
The one that didn’t, however, 
was the singular blemish on 

the 
defensive 

unit’s resume.

On first and 

10 
with 
just 

under 12 minutes 
remaining 
in 
the 
third 

quarter, 
Arion 

Worthman — Air 
Force’s 
starter 

under 
center 

— 
made 
the 

Wolverines 
pay 

for complacency. 
He 
found 
his 

receiver, Ronald 
Cleveland, 

who busted the play open for 
a 
64-yard 
touchdown 
that 

brought the Falcons within 
three. Bush admitted that, for 
the play, they were “lulled to 
sleep” by Air Force’s run-heavy 
scheme.

Still, Michigan didn’t allow 

a single point for the rest of the 
game. They notched three sacks 
and nine tackles for loss. The 
Falcons converted on just three 
of their 13 third-down attempts.

With the way the Wolverines’ 

offense was sputtering, the 
singular mistake could have 
been costly. In the end, though, 
a unit that surrendered just 13 
points against a triple-option 
system notoriously hard to 
prepare for deserves its credit.

Michigan’s defense checked 

off another box Saturday. And 
if you ask Bush or Winovich, 
they’re just getting started.

“You haven’t seen us at our 

best yet,” Bush said. “You 
haven’t seen us lights out yet. 
We get three and outs, but we 
want it much cleaner. We want 
first down, second down, third 
down — out.”

Added Winovich: “It’s the 

little details. We’re so close to 
being such a great team. And 
Coach Harbaugh talked about 
this, how our defense could be 
special. And I believe we’re on 
our way.”

Kieffer-Wright, Crocker
key to Wolverine victory

With 
the 
Michigan 

volleyball team clinging to 
a one point lead, Cincinnati 
defensive 
specialist 
Abby 

Williams readied her serve. 
She 
fired 
the 
ball 
over 

the 
net, 
deflecting 
it 
off 

the 
outstretched 
arms 
of 

Michigan’s 
senior 
outside 

hitter Adeja Lambert for a 
service ace. Suddenly, a 2-9 
Bearcats team was tied with 
the 21st - ranked Wolverines.

They 
appeared 
to 
have 

Michigan on the ropes. 

Apparently, they didn’t.
Senior 
middle 
blocker 

Claire Kieffer-Wright quickly 
pounded a kill down the 
center of the court, junior 
middle blocker Cori Crocker 
redirected 
a 
Cincinnati 

hit down to the floor for 
a Michigan point and the 
Wolverines never looked back.

Michigan ended up winning 

the match in straight sets 
(25-16, 25-21, 25-18), adding 
yet another win to its perfect 
home record at Cliff Keen 
Arena on Saturday night.

This victory came in large 

part due to the efforts of the 
Wolverines’ two star middle 
blockers. Their defense was 
truly 
spectacular; 
Kieffer-

Wright tied her season high 
with 
seven 
blocks 
while 

Crocker had six. Several times 
throughout the match, the 
duo’s defense was so stifling 
that the Bearcats were barely 
able to get the ball over the net 
for several possessions.

Michigan coach Mark Rosen 

praised 
Kieffer-Wright 
for 

“just making great moves,” 
and commended Crocker for 
her athleticism.

“Cori is the most physical 

player we’ve ever had,” Rosen 
said. “At times she’s getting hit 

off her head because she’s so 
far above the net. Today, she 
got her hands way across the 
net, and almost got on the ball 
before the hitters got on the 
ball, and I think therefore she 
blocked a lot of balls.”

In a season where the 

Wolverines 
have 
struggled 

to generate a high volume 
of 
blocks, 
a 
defensive 

performance like this was 
refreshing for Rosen, who 
called the game, “the best 
defensive, and especially the 
best blocking match we’ve had 
this season.”

“Our defense across the 

board hasn’t been where we 
want it to be,” Rosen said, “and 
that’s been a big focus for us 
the whole week at practice.”

Both of the middle blockers’ 

defense was excellent, but 
they had solid offensive games 
as well — especially Kieffer-
Wright. Through the first 
two sets, she collected nine 
kills, including a service ace 
and several spikes that she 
blasted from the center of the 
court. Although she began 
to struggle offensively in the 
final set, she never appeared 
to be flustered and continued 
to trust in herself.

Crocker, 
meanwhile, 

contributed just four kills, 
but they all came at important 
times, 
including 
two 
that 

came right after the Bearcats 
appeared to have the second 
set within their grasp.

And that was the story of 

the game — whenever the 
Bearcats appeared to be poised 
for a comeback, Crocker and 
Kieffer-Wright 
deftly 
shut 

the door. Whether it was 
with their suffocating blocks 
or timely kills, they kept 
themselves off the ropes. They 
kept their team from faltering. 
They 
kept 
the 
Wolverines 

perfect at home.

MEN’S SOCCER
‘M’ loses heartbreaker
against Michigan State

Sunday’s game between the 

No. 18 Michigan men’s soccer 
team and 
No. 
6 

Michigan 
State was 
perhaps the most significant 
match in the rivalry’s history. 

For the first time ever, both 

teams were ranked in the top 
25, and the Wolverines were 
coming off a draw against 
No. 1 Indiana in Bloomington. 
While it looked like Michigan 
might be able to pull off the 
upset, the Wolverines fell 
short with a 1-0 overtime loss 
to the Spartans.

Michigan State controlled 

possession for most of the 
game, but Michigan’s defense 
stood its ground. Ultimately, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
lackluster 

attack allowed the Spartans 
to 
control 
momentum 
for 

much of the game.

Throughout the first half, 

Michigan defense was able 
to keep the Michigan State 
strikers out of position and 
make them fight for every 
shot. The match was locked in 
a scoreless draw at halftime, 
yet Michigan State had the 
upper hand due to its ability 
to control the ball.

Michigan started to show 

some 
signs 
of 
aggression 

13 minutes into the first 
half, but it was unable to 
capitalize around the Spartan 
net. To counter Michigan 
State’s 
forceful 
attack, 

the Wolverines we able to 
effectively slow the tempo 
and gain momentum using 
their style of play.

The second half of play was 

much more evenly matched, as 
both Michigan and Michigan 
State went back and forth 
between shots and possession. 
Both teams had multiple open 
looks on goal, trading blows 
like two great boxers.

The Wolverines came out 

of halftime with a different 
mentality, as they moved the 
ball with purpose and added 
grit to their play. Michigan 
was able to gain momentum 
with more time on the ball, 
forcing the Michigan State 
defenders to retreat back into 
coverage.

Increased 
aggression 

from both sides caused both 
team 
to 
amass 
penalties. 

Senior defender Billy Stevens 
received a red card in the 74th 
minute, which brought out 
a huge altercation between 
the two teams. A few minutes 
later, Michigan State defender 
Brad Centala drew a yellow 
card.

After a full 90 minutes, the 

match was still scoreless, and 
the two in-state rivals went 
head-to-head in an overtime 
period. 
The 
10-minute 

overtime 
period 
was 

controlled by the Spartans, as 
they pushed the ball forward 
deep into Wolverine territory.

With just 31 seconds left 

on the clock in overtime, 
Michigan 
State 
forward 

DeJuan Jones nailed a shot 
into the lower right part of the 
goal to give the Spartans the 
victory.

“It’s college soccer,” said 

Michigan coach Chaka Daley. 
“We’ll get healthy and learn 
from our mistakes.”

Daley 
believes 
that 
his 

team learned a lot from being 
down three key players and 
that his team will mature 
and grow from this tough 
battle. In addition to Stevens’ 
absence, 
Marcello 
Borges 

(Junior defender) and Daniel 
Mukuna 
(Junior 
defender) 

also suffered injuries in the 
game. According to Daley, 
it was an opportunity for 
his team to adapt to adverse 
circumstances.

“They say weak teams will 

be broken, mediocre teams 
will survive it, and great 
teams will get better as a 
result of it,” Daley said.
