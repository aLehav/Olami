Village Corner owner says

Despite rumors,

By LINDSAY KRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
After 40 years on the corner of
South University and South Forest

Avenues, campus mainstay Vil-
lage Corner may have to relocate,
leaving students living in the area
without a place to go for late-night
food runs or alcohol purchases.
Plans for a student high-rise
in Village Corner's location have
been in the works for the last few
years, putting the store's location
in limbo. In the last few weeks, Vil-
lage Corner's owner Dick Scheer

and developer Ron Hughes have
been discussing alease buyout that
would allow Hughes to begin con-
structing the apartment building
in the store's space and force VC
to move.
Scheer said any rumors that
the store is closing are unfounded,
adding that he's not planning on
relocating until he is positive that
Village Corner won't be able to

stay in its current location.
"Well we've had this high-rise
shadow over us for four years,"
Scheer said. "And another project
was projected for four years before
that. We're essentially carrying
out until something is certain."

CONTROVERSIAL SPEAKER ON CAMPUS
MLK's niece to talk abortion
views in civil rights context

Students say they
plan to protest
pro-life speech on
campus tonight
By OLIVIA CARRINO
Daily StaffReporter
Continuing her uncle's discus-
sion of the Civil Rights Movement,
Alveda King - Martin Luther King
Jr.'s niece - is coming to campus
tonight to extend the conversation
of minority rights to the hot-button
issue of abortion.
The University's chapter of Stu-

dents for Life has invited King to
speak tonight in an event called
"How Can the Dream Survive?"
during which she will discuss abor-
tionin the contextof the civil rights
movement. King - the director of
the pro-life advocacy group Priests
for Life - has drawn controversy in
recent weeks for her views on abor-
tion and gay marriage as well as her
appearance at Fox News commen-
tator Glenn Beck's Rally to Restore
Honor in August.
Though many students
expressed interest in welcoming
King to campus, students like LSA
junior Raina LaGrand opposed the
presentation.
LaGrand, a member of the Uni-

versity's chapter of Students for
Choice, said King's relation to Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. makes criticism
of the event difficult but that cer-
tain misconceptions still need to be
addressed.
"What's interesting is that anti-
choice (and) pro-life groups have
framed abortion as a eugenics
movement," she said. "They are
stating that Planned Parenthood
targets black communities. Alveda
King has been very outspoken on
that, and she has said a lot of homo-
phobic things as well."

president for Students for Life, said

DETROIT - Embryonic and
adult stem cells have captured

the imaginations of scientists
and researchers looking for the
next breakthrough in regenera-
tive medicine. For Max Wicha,
director of the University's Com-
prehensive Cancer Center, the
question of what can happen
when stem cells go awry is just as
important.
Wicha, also a professor of
internal medicine at the Univer-
sity's Medical School, posed this
question to a crowd of about 35

people at the beginning of his
presentation on the final day of
the sixth annual World Stem Cell
Summit - an international, three-
day gathering of leaders in stem
cell research - held this year in
Detroit.
Just as the majority of stem cell

Scarves With A Purpose

With cemperacures
beginning to drop in Ann
Arbor, LSA sophomore Mel
Hebeisen and the members of
her organization - Scarves
Wich A Purpose - are pro-
viding warmch to chnse in
need.
The club, which was scart-
ed last year, aims to provide
knitted scarves to area home-
less shelters and hospitals.
Hebeisen said the scarves act
as both wearable gifts and,
more importantly, reminders
that the recipient is cared fur.
"We try tn let people know
they are part of our commu-
nity by welcoming them with
our scarves and makingcthem
feel loved," Hebeisen said.
An avid knitter, Hebeisen
said she began knitting for
the cause in middle school at
home in Evanston, Ill. with

her mother. Upon coming to
the University, she founded
SWAP with support from her
academic learning communi-
ty, the Michigan Community
Scholars Program.
The club has since grown
and now has upwards of 100
members. Besides knitting
with one another, members
of the group also accept
donations from anyone offer-
ing scarves or supplies.
to addition to knitting,
Hebeisen said she and many
members of the club are edu-
cating themselves about the
devastating effects of pov-
erty.
"Last year, we were really
based on knitting and not
much else, but now we're
trying to educate our group
about homelessness and pov-
erty," she explained.

This semester, Hebeisen
said the group has plans to
partner with local nursing
homes to knit and bond with
residents while encourag-
ing them to donate to the
needy. She said most com-
pleted scarves are donated
to the Delonis Center home-
less shelter in downtown Ann
Arbor, but the group occa-
sionally donates to areas in
Chicago and is looking for a
shelter in Detroit as well
Hebeisen added that most
members don't know how
to knit upon joining but can
pick it up quickly at one of the
club's weekly meetings.
"The meetings get really,
really intense and it's kind
of stressful to teach so many
people (to knit). But it's fun..
and it's worth it," she said,

Bernero, state
officials want freeze
on foreclosures
Two congressional members and
gubernatorial candidate Virg Ber-
nero say Michigan should be added
to the list of states where mortgage
companies have frozen home fore-
closures.
Three banks have halted fore-
closures in 23 states after evidence
surfaced that their employees
or outside lawyers signed docu-
ments without reading them or
* filed inaccurate paperwork, rais-
ing concerns about potential legal
violations.
Democratic U.S. Reps. John
Conyers and Carolyn Cheeks Kil-
patrick said yesterday the foreclo-
sure moratorium for the 23 states
that require foreclosures to go
through judicial review should be
extended to all states, including
Michigan. Bernero agrees.
Republican gubernatorial can-
didate Rick Snyder says the banks
should be investigated. He doesn't
favor a statewide moratorium
because he says that could affect the
availability of credit.
COLUMBIA, S.C.
Prison faces legal
trouble in book ban
A South Carolina jail was sued
yesterday over its policy barring
inmates from having any reading
material other than the Bible.
The American Civil Liberties
Union filed the federal lawsuit
seeking to overturn the policy on
behalf of Prison Legal News, a
monthly journal on prison law. The
16-page complaint says officials at
the Berkeley County jail in Moncks
Corner, about 100 miles southeast
of Columbia, are violating several
of the magazine's and inmates'
constitutional rights including free
speech, freedom of religion and
right to due process.
Since 2008, the publishers of
Prison Legal News have tried to
send magazines, letters and self-
help books about prison life to
several inmates at the jail, the com-
plaint says.
"Our inmates are only allowed to
receive soft back bibles in the mail
directly from the publisher," First
Sergeant K. Habersham noted in
the e-mail. "They are not allowed to
have magazines, newspapers, or any
other type of books."

Three Russians
sentenced for
terrorist attacks
A Russian court has handed long
sentences to three ultranationalists
convicted ofhate killings and bomb-

The Moscow City Court said in a

were in a militant neo-pagan cult
and preyed on labor migrants from
ex-Soviet Central Asia and the Cau-
casus.
It said between 2008 and 2009

they killed 10 people and arranged
bombings at a Russian Orthodox
church, a McDonald's restaurant
and a railway station that left one
womanwounded.
Itsaid twoofthe defendants were
underage and received sentences of
between 8 and 9 years. The third
defendant was over 18 at the time of
the murders and got a 21-year sen-
tence.
HILLSBORO, Ore.
Suspect pleads
guilty to murder of
pregnant woman ,
An Oregon woman accused of
murdering a pregnant woman from
Maryland and cutting the unborn
child from her womb pleaded guilty
yesterday to a charge of aggravated
murder and was sentenced to life in
prison.
The sentence prohibits parole for
Korena Roberts. The battered body
of 21-year-old Heather Snively was
found in the crawl space of Roberts'
home in June 2009 after Roberts'
boyfriend cal led 911.
Prosecutors say Roberts blud-
geoned Snively in the bathroom
with a collapsible police baton, then
used a sharp instrument to cut the
unborn baby from Snively's abdo-
men. The baby was due a month
later.
For months before the killing,
Roberts told neighbors was she was
pregnant, going so far as to acquire a
stroller, baby formula and parenting
magazines.

U .S apologizes for
recent helicopter
attacktt in Pakistan

Apology could
lead to key border
crossing reopening
ISLAMABAD (AP) - The U.S.
apologized yesterday for a recent
helicopter attack that killed two
Pakistani soldiers at an outpost'
near the Afghan border, saying
American pilots mistook the sol-
diers for insurgents they were
pursuing.
The apology, which came after
a joint investigation, could pave
the way for Pakistan to reopen a
key border crossing that NATO
uses to ship goods into land-
locked Afghanistan. Pakistan
closed the crossing to NATO sup-
ply convoys in apparent reaction
to the Sept. 30 incident.
Suspected militants have
taken advantage of the impasse to
launch attacks against stranded
or rerouted trucks, including two
yesterday where gunmen torched
at least 55 fuel tankers and killed
a driver.
"We extend our deepest apol-
ogy to Pakistan and the families
of the Frontier Scouts who were
killed and injured," said the U.S.
ambassador to Pakistan, Anne
Patterson.
Pakistan initially reported that
three soldiers were killed and
three wounded in the attack, but
one of the soldiers who was criti-
cally injured and initially report-
ed dead ended up surviving, said
Maj. Fazlur Rehman, the spokes-
man for the Frontier Corps.
Pakistani soldiers fired at the
two U.S. helicopters prior to the
attack, a move the investigation
team said was likely meant to
notify the aircraft of their pres-
ence after they passed into Paki-
stani airspace several times.
"We believe the Pakistani
border guard was simply firing
warning shots after hearing the
nearby engagement and hearing
the helicopters flying nearby,"
said U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Tim
Zadalis, NATO's director for air
plans in Afghanistan who led the

investigation. "This tragic event
could have been avoided with
better coalition force coordina-
tion with the Pakistan military."
The head of U.S. and NATO
forces in Afghanistan, Gen. David
Petraeus, also expressed his con-
dolences, saying in a statement
that "we deeply regret this tragic
loss of life and will continue to
work with the Pakistan military
and government to ensure this
doesn't happen again."
Pakistan moved swiftly after
the attack to close the Torkham
border crossing that connects
northwestern Pakistan with
Afghanistan through the famed
Khyber Pass. The closure has
left hundreds of trucks stranded
alongside the country's highways
and bottlenecked traffic heading
to the one route into Afghanistan
from the south that has remained
open.
There have been seven attacks
on NATO supply convoys since
Pakistan closed Torkham, includ-
ing those yesterday.
NATO officials have insisted
that neither the attacks nor the
border closure have caused sup-
ply problems for NATO troops
since hundreds of trucks still
cross into Afghanistan each day
through the Chaman crossing in
southwestern Pakistan and via
Central Asian states.
But reopening Torkham is
definitely a priority for NATO
because it is the main crossing
in Pakistan, the country through
which NATO ships the majority
of its supplies into Afghanistan.
Other routes are more expensive
and logistically difficult.
Both U.S. and Pakistani offi-
cials have predicted Torkham
would reopen soon, and the apol-
ogies issued yesterday could pro-
vide Pakistan with a face-saving
way to back down.
Reopening the border could
reduce the frequency with which
militants have attacked NATO
supply convoys in recent days,
although such attacks occurred
regularly even before Torkham
was closed.

n late September, a student at Rutgers University took his
own life after he was a victim of a dangerous trend: cyberbul-
lying. A concept that has quickly spun out of control as Inter-
net technology has advanced and more students are connected,
cyberbullying has been the cause of multiple suicides in the last
month. Cyberbullying has even happened on campus - Andrew
Shirvell's recent Internet attacks on Michigan Student Assembly
President Chris Armstrong could certainly qualify as cyberbully-
ing. But this threat is rarely combated at the legal level. The state
must address the seriousness of this threat and create legislation
to protect the victims of cyberbullying.

As college students these days,
we don't have to bother with
a lot of things like we did in
the past, like polio.
So why should
we bother with
exams? It's a trou-
bling question.,
It's not a ques-
tion that will get
you in trouble,
like, "Are you sure
a knife is armed
robbery?" No, it's a WILL
troubling question GRUNDLER
because I'm wor-
ried it doesn't make -
much sense and
my editors will yell at me like usual.
Also, Ive been up all night studying
for exams and my brain has liquefied
and my eyeballs have all dried up and
I wish my body would just go back to
normal because it's getting really hard
to stay coherent and ask tougher ques-
tions like, "How do I explain to the
studentbody how to fix the economy in
under 800 words?"
Now, at this point you may be say-
ing, "Gosh, I'd sure like to know how
to fix the economy! Betcha I'd make a
bundle of money ifI fixed the econo-
my!" Please quiet down; you're mak-
ing my headache worse.
Where was I? Let's see, according
to my column outline - which I make
every time a column is due so I don't
just write nonsense - the fourth
paragraph is where I introduce my
thesis with a joke. (Note to English
majors: A delayed thesis or even no
point at all can be powerful in litera-
ture, such as "The Scarlet Letter" by
Nathaniel Hawthorne.)
Thesis: Maybe we could stop tak-
ing exams...?
Joke: Why was the belt thrown in
jail?
Punch line: Because he held up a
pair of pants!
Now then: Exams - do we really
need them? Through careful analy-
sis, 've concluded that many students
strongly dislike studying and it would
be beneficial for the University to

abandon them. My full results (which
I've forwarded to University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman) are slightly
technical, of course, filled with graphs
and statistics and allegories, so I'll just
present some basic points in this col-.
umn, starting with:
The University is a business. We've
all heard this before. Sometimes it's
expressed as, "That University is
just a (bleep)ing business you little
(bleep)" by our legal guardians, but
the idea remains the same. And if the
University wants to remain competi-
tive in the business of attracting the
best undergraduates, attracting the
leaders among undergraduates - in
short, attracting the best AND the
leaders - -then eliminating exams
from the curriculum is a brilliant
marketing ploy.
Who doesn't want to have exams?
Everyone. Statistically, then, the Uni-
versity would attract the majority of
really intelligent students. At least
I think so. Honestly, I have doubts
about writing this and making the
strategy public. I'm imagining the
slogan, "The University of Michigan:
Harvard without the exams!"
There's also student health. I care
deeply about the health of my fellow
students and exams make them go
absolutely crazy. Take my experience
a couple days ago, when some idiot
nearly assaulted me at a drinking
fountain. The fountain in question
was outside a lecture hall where my
anthropology exam was to take place.
There was plenty of time before the
start of the exam, mind you, when I
began to fill my water bottle.
The student in question, who had
to wait, completely ignored the cus-
toms of our country and stood to
the SIDE of me (rather closely, too),
presumably so he could glare at me
and remind me that he, too, would
like some water, and fast, because
the exam was about to start in ten
minutes. To stress this point even
further, the young man ad ed
closer and leaned against the wall
in an intimidating manner as if he
wanted to meet at the flagpole after

the exam to settle things like men.
Needless to say, I calmly finished fill-
ing my water bottle before returning
his glare with a look that said, more
or less, "Even though the discipline
of anthropology stresses the diversi-
ty and equality of all human life, you,
sir, are a (bleep)head."
Of course, he was probably just
stressed out or on drugs because of
exams. How much longer will the
University continue to subject stu-
dents to such anxiety?
Thesis.
Joke.
Punchline.
Lastly, there is plenty of technology
available these days, making the pro-
cess of memorization obsolete. Why
does the University think exams arose
in the first place? Because we didn't
have computers and the Internet to
Look Stuff Up. Nowadays the practice
of cramming loads of information into
our heads is unnecessary.
All in all, in a perfect world we
would learn things - rather than sim-
ply memorize them for exams - and
then afterward, assuming this world
is perfect, we would not be tested on
the learning, wouldn't even get grades,
because letters don't count for knowl-
edge, and at the after-class party the
professor would be cool and make
funny jokes that were offensive, but
in a good way, and the alcohol would
be free, and everyone would have an
extremely attractive significant other,
and people would not be obnoxious at
drinking fountains, and -

As campus has witnessed over the past
week, the problems inherent in creating equal
civil rights in our country have yet to be fully
resolved. Today, difficult issues of bullying,
sexual identity and privacy are interwoven
into a portrait of reality that America would
rather not confront. But this silence has a cost:
In the past year alone, at least 10 gay teenagers
across the nation have taken their own lives as
a result of bullying and harassment.
The most recent of these tragedies occurred
at Rutgers University, where freshman Tyler
Clementi took his own life last week after two
of his hall mates filmed him having a sexual
encounter with another male student. After
the encounter was broadcast online, Tyler
jumped off the George Washington Bridge into
the Hudson River.
But amid the fog of this sadness, there are
glimmers of light and hope. From University
President Mary Sue Coleman to the dozens of
student groups that signed onto the "Expect
Respect" petition, this campus has been an
example of acceptance, openness and expres-
sion of self while grappling with our own case
of intolerance.
Both local and national news outlets have
covered the story of Andrew Shirvell, a Michi-
gan assistant attorney general, who has cre-
ated and maintained a blog that criticizes our
Michigan Student Assembly president primar-
ily because of his sexual identity.
Shirvell's attacks on Chris Armstrong, his
family, friends and campus affiliations are
unwarranted, unnecessary and wrong. We
stand up against Shirvell's personal attacks
on Armstrong in addition to the misrepre-
sentation and misuse of Order of Angell, a
senior leadership society, as a way to propa-
gate his hate agenda. As individuals through
our respective organizations and as a collec-
tive, we continue to fight for the respect of
all, regardless of background. The strength to
fight comes from within, as we are an organi-
zation that reflects today's society: we are gay
and straight; of color and white; conservative

and progressive; and religious and secular.
And we are committed to standing for the
individuals that make up our university. Using
Order of Angell as a scapegoat and shroud for
discrimination only circumvents confronting
actual issues.
Shirvell's attacks against all parties are
ignorant, ill-informed and, above all, unfound-
ed. They detract from the real point: As acam-
pus community, there is a need among all of us
for more constructive dialogue that leads to
positive understanding and action.
Let our campus culture continue to evolve as
we stand up to intolerance and hate wherever
it may rear its head. Let the grumbles denounc-
ing Shirvell and his actions grow louder and
broader as we stand up against bigotry, wheth-
er it be in Ann Arbor or anywhere else. And let
the members of this campus community feel
even more proud for being their diverse selves,
regardless of religious belief, race, sexual ori-
entation or any other metric.
As our student body president, Armstrong
purposefully chose to surround himself with
diverse students, leaders, and opinions. As we
build abetter tomorrow, we should all embrace
Armstrong's action to accept everyone, regard-
less of background or identity. As one step out
of many, we invite you to attend the Campus
GlowLight Vigil on Monday, Oct. 11 at 8:15 p.m.
near the Cube. This vigil is one of many events
the Spectrum Center is planning next week,
and is a way to send a message that bullying,
hate and bias are not acceptable.
May all students proudly attend next week's
events to show that, regardless of one's per-
sonal point of view, intolerant demagogues
and hatred have no place at our university. The
attacks against Armstrong have shown that we
can't let our guard down. We must continually
show our unyielding devotion to that which
makes us who we are - the diverse and toler-
ant students of the University of Michigan.

Say ves ' to C VS

ccording to a Sept. 28 Daily
article, it won't be much lon-
er until construction is fin-
ished on a new CVS
Pharmacy on State
Street. While this
may be exciting
news to some, oth-
ers are complaining
that the proverbial
virginity of down-
town Ann Arbor
is at stake and are -
upset over the has- ALEX
sles of construc-
tion (Officials: CVS BILES
slated to open near
campus early next
year, 09/28/2010). IShave two words for
those of you up in arms about the new
CVS construction: Stop whining.
First, there may exist concerns
among individuals about the demo-
lition of a building constructed in
1899 and deemed part of the city's
historic district. Yet, a look at the old
structure - which will be replaced
by the CVS - reveals a gray, grimy
and uninspiring exterior. It's not like
we're talking about the demolition
of part of the Law Quad here. In my
opinion, the dullness of the current
structure is conceivably a reason why
the city allowed CVS to move in.
Then there's the neighboring busi-
ness - Mr. Greek's Coney Island -
that blames a loss of business due to
the CVS construction. This argument
doesn't do much for me. If somebody
possesses enough desire to eat at the
Coney Island, the individual can find
his or her way into the unobstructed
building without much difficulty. Yes,
the construction is currently reducing
the availability of a couple of parking
spots, but I have trouble imagining a
time when parking spots on the most
business-packed strip of State Street
weren't a premium. Also, I would hope
that Mr. Greek's would be well-aware
of the risk of neighboring construction
incurred by leasing the State Street

property. Case in point: North Quad.
Some students dislike the idea of
the CVS pharmacy because of their
allegiance to the closest - and only
- campus drug store, The Village
Apothecary. I'm sure many students
prefer the intimacy and potentially
superior customer service provided
by the family-owned enterprise. And
that's fine. But one's personal pref-
erence is generally not suited to the
taste of everyone else. Also, I find it
wrong to manifest one's prejudices
toward a business into a maxim for
others to follow. This type of think-
ing - when put into action - has
the potential to severely hinder the
choices of individuals in a market-
place, effectively telling them how to
spend their money.
Perhaps the greatest pet-peeve I
have about anti-CVS sentiment is the
romanticizing of "mom and pop"-era
State Street. Within a close vicinity
to CVS stands Potbelly's Sandwiches,
Ben and Jerry's, Buffalo Wild Wings,
Starbucks Coffee, Urban Outfitters
and Chipotle. These are all national
chains. And frankly, I find it hard to
believe that Ann Arbor is worse off
for having these. On the contrary -
Chipotle serves delicious burritos at
the same price as BTB, and Starbucks
- though a tad pricey - provides the
community with access to gourmet
coffee. If these chains had never been
allowed to "invade" this stretch of
State Street, the community's access
to Chunky Monkey ice cream, Caffe
Vanilla Frappuccinos, pulled pork
burritos, v-neck t-shirts and miscel-
laneous hipster paraphernalia would
be dramatically reduced.
Those looking for a lesson in this
matter need to look no further than
season 2, episode 17 of "South Park."
In the episode, the city is assaulted
by the arrival of international cof-
fee conglomerate, Harbucks. A wave
of unjustified anti-corporate fervor
takes over the city, as local rivals
push a poli ical campaign to drive the
r1

chain out of town. In the end, South
Park citizens finally taste Harbucks
coffee, in awe of the product's supe-
riority over the local competition and
in realization of their stupidity. And
though fictional, the "South Park"
episode resembles the current situa-
tion with CVS.
This is not a defense of corporations,
but rather of common sense. Most of
my favorite places to eat in Ann Arbor
are locally-owned. I prefer them for a
number of reasons: the cuisine, atmo-
sphere, customer service and price. But

Chain stores
offer students
more options.
I also recognize a clear advantage when
I see one. There has been a demand on
campus for a large pharmacy for sev-
eral years now. The opening of the new
CVS Pharmacy will grant the campus
community easier access to medicines
and other goods at times far later than
6 p.m. (the time thatthe Village Apoth-
ecary's pharmacy closes), compared to
our current situation where one has to
venture miles away from campus to
find such a pharmacy.
Not to mention that the CVS will
create dozens of jobs and even restore
the parking spots next to Mr. Greek's
Coney Island. Personally, I'm finding
it hard to see what's not to like here.
If we truly consider the benefits and
avoid thinking along the lines of eco-
nomic protectionism or romanticizing
about the nonexistent glory days of
State Street business, the advantages
of a CVS Pharmacy close to campus are
clearly evident.

cussions and presentations at the
summit. Wicha's presentation on
cancer stem cells - cells within a
tumor that fuel the tumor's growth
- stuck out on the summit agenda.
In 2003, University research-
ers reported the first discovery
of cancer stem cells, or CSCs, in
breast cancer tissue. These cells
have since been discovered in many
other types of cancer, including
those chat affect the brain, head,
neck, colon and pancreas.
CSCs constitute only about 1 to
5 percent of all cells in a malignant
tumor, but despite their relatively
small proportion, these cells are
responsible for regenerating new
cancer cells.
That's the reason, Wicha said,
he and other scientists believe an
effective cancer treatment must
specifically target CSCs.
Wicha acknowledged that in
recent years, existing treatments
that don't target CSCs have still
lowered the death rates of certain
types of cancer. As a breast cancer
specialist, he pointed out that the
death rate from breast cancer saw

a "precipitous fall" after 1990, and
breast cancer patients are now 25
percent less likely to die from the
disease than they were 20 years ago.
But the success of current cancer
treatments, Wicha said, is largely
due to early detection and preven-
tion. He said doctors still struggle
to treat advanced cancers and that
certain diagnoses like that of pan-
creatic cancer still coincide with
high death rates.
Wicha added that the advances
in treatment have thus far been
incremental and not dramatic,
because scientists have been tar-
geting the wrong cells.
According to Wicha, cancers
are "driven" by cells that can make
exact copies of themselves through
a process called self-renewal - a

$888 million the state appropri-
ates to the three universities.
URC Executive Director Jeff
Mason echoed Anderson's assess-
ment, calling the URC "a bright spot

"Michigan has the third fast-
est research and development

innovation clusters," Mason said
in a press release. "Just as impor-
tantly, we're getting stronger rel-
ative to the competition, which
puts us in a good position to
help propel the state's economic
growth in the future."
University of Michigan Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman said in a
statement she is pleased with the
recognition the URC is getting
for its efforts.
"A recent headline from the
San Francisco Business Times
really said it all," Coleman said,
referencing a headline that read,
'California's Innovation Model...

worked to change attitudes about

shows the word is getting out."
Michigan State President Lou
Anna K. Simon said in a state-
ment that she is also pleased with
the URC's innovation activity -
which includes new patents and
licensing revenue.
"We're working diligently and
creatively to make university
resources accessible to entre-
preneurs and businesses," Simon
said in a statement. "This report
reflects the impact of those
efforts in addition to growth in
other benchmark areas."
Each member of the URC has
an industry liaison division,
which includes the University of
Michigan's Business Engagement
Center, to aid in such efforts.
Allan Gilmour, interim presi-
dent at Wayne State University
and former CFO and vice chair-
man at Ford Motor Company,
said the report demonstrates
the value of those collaborations
between industry and higher
education.
"Businesses and universities
are both part of the solution to
our economic challenges," Gilm-
our said in a press release. "It's
the combined power that can

added that in these tough economic
times, everyone feels the impact of
budget cuts.
"We've really had to tighten our

legislators will be paid 10-percent
less than they were before."
Byrnes said she doesn't know
how universities in the state plan to
cope with the cuts.
"I don't know whether that
means they're going to have to
tighten their belts more," she said.
"Are they going to be looking at
more tuition increases?"

"In some ways, it's good news
because they thought (the budget

DesJardins, who is a higher edu-
cation expert, said he feels the Uni-

In addition to diverging on the
level of the cuts, Democrats and
Republicans differed on whether
the higher education budget should
include language requiring univer-
sities to report stem cell research

strongly for institutional reports on
the state of stem cell research proj-
ects, while Democrats advocated
for the schools to have autonomy on

abortion because she has been in
the situation "emotionally, physi-
cally and academically."
"I think she realizes abortion
really does impact the rights of
women and it really does impact
the way America sees people," she
said. "I think she is going to talk
about how minorities are targeted
by Planned Parenthood ... (and)
how Planned Parenthood was
built on a very racist foundation."
LaGrand said she feels it is
upsetting that King, who identi-
fies as a civil rights activist and
has had two abortions herself,
is speaking out against Planned
Parenthood given its support for
minority communities.
"I would point out that she is
just one voice of many women
who have had abortions, and that
there are many women out there
who will tell you that their abor-
tions have saved their lives or
have prevented them from getting
in a positionthat wasgoing to take
them on a bad path,"'she said.
Levis responded to ques-
tions concerning Eing's back-

ground, saying that she believes
that King's change in viewpoints
came from the realization that
the "hurt, suffering and depres-
sion she was going through was
a result of the abortions, and that
her self-destructive behavior
came from the fact that she went
through that."
Levis added that assistant dean
of students Sam Goodin advised
the group to meet with the pro-
testers to avoid disruptions to this
evening's event.
Though Students for Choice is
not planning to attend the event
as a group, LaGrand said group
members will be hanging fly-
ers tomorrow showcasing their
views.
Levis said the ultimate goal of
the event, and for Students for
Life, is to educate women on cam-
pus about their options.
"I really hope that people who
come to the speech will under-
stand that we are only trying to
help women," she said. "We aren't
trying to accuse anyone, we're not
trying to target anyone, we are
just here to say that abortion is an
awful thing, and it's not your only
option and you don't want to have
a life of pain and suffering."

distinct characteristic of stem cells.
When the self-renewal process in
these cells becomes deregulated,
cancer develops.
The CSCs that are responsible
for cancer development are resis-
tant to treatments like chemother-
apy that shrink tumors, so after the
treatment, the CSCs constitute a
higher percentage of the total cells
in the tumor, Wicha said.
Wicha said that in general,
shrinking tumors does not neces-
sarily increase a patient's lifespan
because it does not attack the root
of the disease.
"Tumor shrinkage does not cor-
relate well with patient survival,"
he said.
A treatment that will effectively
cure a patient, Wicha said, is one
that will stop metastasis - the

spread of the disease to other parts
of the body. About 99 percent of
deaths from breast cancer are due
to metastasis, he added.
Scientists have determined that
CSCs and not other cancer cells are
responsible for metastasis.
In collaboration with research-
ers at Baylor College and the Dana
Farber Cancer Institute, the Uni-
versity has completed one clini-
cal trial in testing a CSC-targeting
drug. Anne Schott, an associate
professor in the University Medi-
cal School's department of internal
medicine, was the principal inves-
tigator for the trial.
The study involved 35 partici-

participants tolerated the treatment

treatment, and they all showed a
decrease in the percentage of CSCs,
which is exactly the opposite of
what happens with chemotherapy.
Wicha said the question remains
whether patients will ultimately
benefit from the treatment. He esti-
mated that after phase two studies
of the drug, which will begin in
one to two years and last for about
two years, scientists will be able to
determine whether this treatment
is beneficial. In total, the process
should take roughly five years.

of research, Wicha said, is that a
documented increase in survival
rate is often the proof necessary
to declare a drug successful, but
that kind of proof could take years
to acquire.

Bridgette Carr says
we're in a'era of
disposable people'
By SABIRA KHAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Law School Professor Bridgette
Carr addressed a gathering in the
Betty Ford classroom in Weill Hall
on Wednesday night in an effort to
highlight the prevalence of human
trafficking.
The event, which was organized
by the University of Michigan
Journal of International Affairs,
featured a short speech by Carr fol-
lowed by a question-and-answer
session.
Carr began by clarifying the
definition of human trafficking and
clearing up common misconcep-
tions about the issue.
"One of the words that pop up
(when thinking about) human traf-
ficking is movement or transpor-
tation and unfortunately that is a
myth that many people think," Carr
said. "Human trafficking is at its
core about exploitation and in the
U.S., Human trafficking is defined
as one of two types: sex or labor."
Carr explained that despite
its grotesque nature, many for-
mer drug dealers turn to the field,
because there is often a lower risk of
being caught and penalized than is
the case with dealing drugs.
"If I had 150 pounds of heroin
sitting up here and I want to sell it,
someone could come see it, take a
photo of it and show it to the cops,"
Carr explained. "I could have a
slave sitting with me in this room
and if I was good at my job - which
is terrifying that slave - you guys
wouldn't know it, I wouldn't have to
hide him or her."
Carr added that human traffick-
ing can often be more lucrative than
dealing drugs.
"The other great thing is if I sold
all of you two pounds of heroin I'm
going to get a profit, but Ive got

Law School Prof. Bridgette Carr discusses the issue of human trafficking at an event last night.

to get more, while I can sell all of
you my slave and you will give him
or her back to me and I get to do it
again and again and I don't have any
of the transaction costs of getting
more," Carr said.
In addition to discussing her own
views, Carr paid homage to other
scholars on the issue. She discussed
work done by Kevin Bales, president
and co-founder of Free the Slave, a
non-profit organization focused on
abolishing slavery worldwide.
According to Carr, Bales
described the present as an "era of
disposable people."
"Today, I can buy a slave for
around 150 bucks," she said.
Despite the prevalence of human
trafficking, Carr said people often
distance themselves from the issue,
saying they aren't in a country that
allows this type of activity and
therefore don't need to act to stop it.
Carr brought the issue home for
the audience by discussing girls who
were found beingtrafficked ina gas
station in Dexter, Mich., just outside
of Ann Arbor. According to Carr,
the gas station is notorious for sex

trafficking.
"Everywhere in Michigan human
trafficking occurs," Carr said. "It
occurs in urban centers, it occurs
in small towns, it's sex and it's free
labor."
She also explained that though
many perceive human trafficking as
a foreign problem, it is in fact very
close to home.
"Some statistics say that there are
over 300,000 children in America at
risk every year of human traffick-
ing," Carr said. "Any one of us could
go out right after this and within
an hour or less have access to those
kids."
Carr added that though the issue
is being addressed at the federal
level to a degree, local police need
to take action to stop human traf-
ficking.
"We won't see a change in human
trafficking significantly, I think,
until local cops and communities
think that this is important to them
and act accordingly," she said.
LSA sophomore Amre Metwally
said the talk changed his perspec-
tive on the issue.

"She opened my eyes to the fact
that no one is immune to this prob-
lem," he said. "In order to get things
to really happen and take effect,
we have to work as communities to
stand and make sure that human
trafficking can't be tolerated."
Just before Carr ended the dis-
cussion, a student raised her hand
and asked what undergraduates
could do to help end human traf-
ficking.
Carr responded by describing her
typical day at work, dealing with
several clients who are victims of
human trafficking.
"And then (at the end of the day),
I'll get in my car," she continued
"and I'll hear students talk about
goingto hoes and pimps parties and
it's like a slap in the face."
Carr explained that students have
a social responsibility to uphold.
"If students had any idea about
the reality of that life, they would
never attend an event that glori-
fied it like that," Carr said. "As stu-
dents, you really have the power to
change the conversation about what
is acceptable."

Frank Lautenberg
says he wants to
require colleges to
prohibit bullying
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP)
- U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg said
yesterday he'll introduce legisla-
tion requiring colleges to adopt
a code of conduct that prohibits
bullying and harassment follow-
ing the suicide of a student whose
gay sexual encounter in his dorm
room was broadcast online.
Lautenberg, D-N.J., made the
announcement at a town meeting
on the Rutgers University campus
in memory of 18-year-old fresh-
man Tyler Clementi.
Clementi, a promising violinist,
jumped off the George Washing-
ton Bridge into the Hudson River
on Sept. 22 after the intimate
images of him with another man
were webcast, and his body was
identified days later.
Clementi's roommate, Dha-
run Ravi, and another Rutgers
freshman, Molly Wei, both 18,
have been charged with inva-
sion of privacy, and authorities
are weighing whether bias crime
charges should be added.
Clementi's death has prompted
a national discussion on the plight
of young gay people and bully-
ing. The Rutgers event, organized
by the university and the gay
rights activist group Garden State
Equality, drew about 300 students
and others, including U.S. Sen.
Robert Menendez, D-N.J., U.S.
Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., and
actress/comedienne Judy Gold, a

Rutgers grad and gay activist who
won two Daytime Emmy Awards
as a writer and producer for "The
Rosie O'Donnell Show."
"No one could have heard
about this degradation he suf-
fered without feeling pain them-
selves," Lautenberg said. "This is
a major problem, and we're going
to fix it."
Gold expressed outrage at the
pain inflicted on Clementi.
"What happened to him was
not just an invasion of privacy.
This was just sick," she said.
Lautenberg said his bill would
require colleges and universities
that receive federal student aid to
create policies prohibiting harass-
ment of any student. Such poli-
cies are not currently required
by federal law, he said. The bill
also would provide funding for
schools to establish programs to
deter harassment of students.
Clementi's death was one of
a string of suicides last month
involving teens believed to have
been victims of anti-gay bully-
ing. Just days after Clementi's
body was recovered, more than
500 people attended a memorial
service for a 13-year-old central
California boy, Seth Walsh, who
hanged himself after enduring
taunts from classmates about
being gay.
Earlier Wednesday, Ravi's law-
yer, Steven D. Altman, issued a
statement saying he was "heart-
ened to hear" that investigators
are taking their time "to learn all
the facts before rushing to judg-
ment" about whether to file bias
charges against his client. Altman
said he hoped the public would do
the same.

Top five Michigan wins FOLLOW @MICHDAILYSPORTS
in the in-state rivalry
Ryan Kartje II Daily Sports Editor
With the Michigan-Michigan State game approaching, Daily Sports took a look
back through the history books to find some of the best games from the in-state
rivalry, from the Wolverines' dominantwin in 1997 on the way to anational cham-
pionship to Braylon Edwards' one-man show in 2004.
Michigan leads the all-time series 67-30-5, and with both teams 5-0 this season,
it could be an instant classic an Ann Arbor this weekend. Until then, here's five of
the best games that went in the Wolverines' favor.
i g Un n
1980- Michigan wins 27-23 on heels of ~
Bo Schembechler's questionable call J
With the game tied 13-13 in the second quarter, the Spartans were U *
called for a roughing the kicker penalty after Michigan's Ali Haji- th bs
Sheikh had nailed a field goal. But instead of opting to decline the
penalty call, Michigan coach Bo Schembechler accepted the penalty,
and three plays later, quarterback John Wangler delivered a strike to wide e s O r
receiver Anthony Carter for atouchdown. Who needs field goals? Not Mich-
i an,as they won the game b exactly the difference between Haji-Sheikh's T 0 4
f eld goal and Carter's touchdown. "
1964- Michigan stops losing skid and C an r i
beats Spartans, 17-10
After a rough stretch against Sparty in the late '50s and '60s, the
Wolverines bounced back and received a huge road win against
their in-state rivals. After the longest Michigan losing streak by far
in the rivalry (eight ames), the Wolverines, led by All-American
Bob Timberlake, ousted Michigan State on their way to the Rose Bowl. C m:
2007- Manningham's late catch lifts
Michigan in East Lansing
3 With victory looking more and more out of reach, Michigan quar- C
terback Chad Henne was left with a 3rd-down-and-12 which ulti- ., y 'f P
mately decided the game in its final minutes. Henne, having thrown
three touchdown passes already, launched a beauty into the back of
the end zone, which seemed almost out of wide receiver Mario Manning-
ham's reach. But Manningham extended just far enough to pull the ball
down, stealing Michigan's last victory over State.
1997- Wolverines trounce Spartans en .. .5
route to '97 National Championship paeop~mc~a
2This game may have been the one that meant the most out of these
top five moments. The Wolverines demoralized a 5-1 Spartan squad
that had its best start since the '60s. Charles Woodson made one of
the greatest interceptions in college football history and did a great
deal to beef up his 1997 Heisman Trophy resume. It may not have had the
same effect as the Wolverines' end-of-the-season win over Ohio State, but
Woodson's grab said it all in Michigan's in-state beatdown on its way to a
national championship.
2004- Braylon Edwards puts on
one-man show in OT victory
In one of the best individual performances in Michigan history, Mich-
igan wideout Braylon Edwards put up three touchdowns in a six-min-
ute span to squeak out one of the wildest victories the program has
ever seen. He essentially did it all for the Wolverines. Edwards, don-
ning the legendary No. 1 jersey, looked like a man among boys, grabbing
touchdown after touchdown over helpless Spartan defensive backs. Then-
0 freshman Chad Henne delivered one of his most poised performances ever,
and Michigan delivered a crushing blow to Sparty. _ ____

Following the Michigan hock-
ey team's tie and win this past
weekend against Mercyhurst and
Western Ontario, respectively, the
coaching staff finally had the oppor-
tunity to skate for the entire length
of practice instead of the shortened
two-hour-a-week pre-season limit.
And after the team's collapse
on Saturday night and its lacklus-
ter win on Sunday, all of the play-
ers would agree having coach Red
Berenson on the ice will hopefully
correlate with better results.
"The tempo out there for the first
three or four drills is obviously a lit-
tle bit better," senior forward Matt
Rust said after practice on Wednes-
day. "Sometimes it's hard to keep
the same intensity level without the
coaches out there regardless of what
the team or the captains are trying
to do."
In Michigan's first full week of
practice there has been a range of

night.

proved to be too much for Cincin-
nati, frustrating the Bearcats to
the point of a brawl in the penalty
box, before going on to win, 2-0.
After the Wolverines' second
goal, the Bearcats were flustered.
Michigan dominated possession,
but yellow cards were pulled
left and right as the game grew
increasingly physical.
Toward the end of the game,
senior forward Justin Meram
found himself in the middle of a
scuffle.
"My buddy Dylan (Mencia)
was in a headlock and I wanted
to separate it," Meram said after
the game. "As a senior, I wanted to
break it up.
"I tried to take him off the guy,
and all of a sudden, they were
attacking me. But it's all just part
of the game."
Further showing their frustra-
tion, Cincinnati began to fire shots
over the goal. As the clock wound

MICHIGAN'S BREAKDANCERS HIT THE FLOOR
WITH HEADSPINS AND WINDMILLS
BY ANKUR SOHONI, DAILY ARTS WRITER

undreds of people
gathered in the
Anderson room
of the Michigan
Union last Sat-
urday, forming
a giant circle.
Some spectators
stood on chairs
around the edge of the huddle. Police officers
stood guard around the back. Others gathered
toward the middle, leaving a small section
of floor exposed like the center of a stadium.
In front of them were two teams of three on
opposite ends, each waiting for its turn to
throw down.
An MC took the mic and spurred on the
battle. One dancer after another, passing from
team to team - the b-boy competition had
begun.
This was the Diag Hip Hop Festival - relo-
cated to the Union due to rain. The event was
planned by a brand new group on campus
called Hip Hop Academy as a way of generat-
ing attention.
The festival was straight out of a dance
film, and overwhelmingly impressive for being
witnessed in reality. During the b-boy com-

petition finals, the dancers used their turns,
timing and teammates to perfection. Every
big move inspired a collective "Oh!" to sweep
over the crowd. While the competition was
isolated to six participants at a time, there's no
question the b-boy performances get everyone
involved, no matter the age and no matter the
experience. From the DJ to the dancers, from
the MC to the crowd - everybody elevates to
the same level.
In their Element
The words "b-boying" and "b-girling" con-
stitute another way - many would say the
proper way - of referring to the style known
as "breakdancing." While considered a street
dance style that values improvisation, it has
concrete elements and aclearstructure within
which performers work. And despite its ability
to impress the crowd, b-boying can be a fierce-
ly personal activity.
Such is the case with campus b-boying
group Element 1. A drastically less competi-
tive atmosphere characterizes the mood at
the Mason Hall posting wall every Monday
and Wednesday night, when the group holds
it meetings. Music blares through the building

- sometimes three or more songs in different
areas of the hall - and b-boys and b-girls prac-
tice their moves while passers-by look on.
There are no battles like those in the week-
end's Hip-Hop Festival, but rather a casual
air of self-discovery and collective positivity.
Some are there preparing a specific routine,
while others are purely practicing technique.
In these past two weeks, as Element 1 has been
bringing in new members, many of the partici-
pants are learning the art for the first time.
LSA freshman Eleni Zaras is one such new-
comer. In her second week with the group,
Element l's leaders could see Zaras beginning
to improve. But as many are with newendeav-
ors, she was nervous to start.
"I came last week," she said. "It was the first
time I came and I got there really early, which
was a little scary."
Zaras didn't have to worry for long, though,
as an older member quickly helped to get her
started on some basic moves.'
Element 1 has resources for people of any
level looking to b-boy. At the same time, it
has an elite Performance Group for which the
group holds tryouts every year. It dances at
student and charity events, and uses its oppor-
tunities to spread its art on campus. Every

year, Element 1 holds an event called Master
the Art, which draws crews to Ann Arbor from
around the country for a competition and cel-
ebration of multiple dance styles.
In developing dancers' performance talent,
Element 1 prides itself on self-improvement.
"B-boying is really individual," said LSA
junior and Element 1 President Jun Tai Kim.
"In my opinion, b-boying is all about creating
your own style. Everybody comes out and peo-
ple can give you feedback on your stuff."
Despite the perception of breakdancing as
a male-dominated art, there is a healthy bal-
ance between b-boys and b-girls at Element 1
practices.
Megan Kao, a sophomore in the School of
Engineering, is on the board of Element 1.
"I'm a b-girl," she said. "Element 1 has
inspired me to be a lot more creative ... and a
lot more self-confident. You know, if you're not
confident in b-boying, then it's not going to
look good."
Element 1 is an unconventional dance
group, but its structure feeds directly off the
personal nature of the art form. Unlike some
hip-hop campus dance groups, which feature
choreography and group dances, Element 1

By Its Cover
Why read a single page when the cover
tells the whole story?

TRAILER REVIEW

There may be no more polarizing
director working today than Julie
Taymor. For every
post-modernist
who swooned
over "Titus" - The Tempest
her adaptation of
William Shake- Touchstone
speare's "Titus
Andronicus" - there's a Beatles
aficionado still furious with her for
rpaking "Across the Universe." The
new trailer for her latest, "The Tem-
pest," won't do anything to win over
her dissenters, but it promises the
film will boast her distinctive visual
style: batshit crazy.
Jumping from the Bard's first-
ever play ("Titus") to his last good
one, Taymor keeps the language but
transplants the setting into a world

of magic and cross-dressing. Dame
Helen Mirren, bending gender roles
as Prospera, spits fire from her staff
and mixes potions in an island labo-
ratory. There's a giant storm and a
shipwreck, and then lots of people
in costume (including Russell Brand
and Djimon Hounsou) run around
island cliffs causing general mayhem.
The trailer doesn't promise to
add anything new to the "modern
phantasmagoria" subgenre already
occupied by pretty much everything
Taymor and Baz Luhrmann ("Mou-
lin Rouge!") have ever made, but at
the very least "The Tempest" should
be fascinating from a sensory stand-
point. Also worth looking forward to:
the sight of the world's most respect-
ed actress transforming into a bird.

ing us to contemplate just what
kind of beat Kanye has cooked up
to complement Vernon's delicate
vocals. The answer comes about a
minute in, and Kanye's gift for syn-

thesizing songs out of other songs
is immediately apparent. He com-
pletely re-imagines "Woods" as a
tribal club-banger with a synco-
pated house beat and vague moral
agenda courtesy of Gil Scott Heron
soundbytes. Bet you didn't see that
one coming.
Just in sheer novelty, the song
succeeds. Kanye spits a brief non-
sense verse, but it doesn't really
matter. It's the song's vibe that
does the heavy lifting - unrelent-
ing, ecclesiastic Vernon hooks,
Afrobeat breakdowns and the fact
that there's like 20 vocal tracks
at any given time make the track
something loftier than just a clever
use of a sample. Kanye takes 'em to

SINGLE REVIEW

Authors Robert Jordan and
Brandon Sanderson have crafted
another classically zany vacation
caper.When Captain Traingle con-
vinces the scoundrel Robin Hood
and the curmudgeonly Merlin to
accompany him on a camping trip,
little does the gang know they're
in for an inter-dimensional roller
coaster ride.
Jordan and Sanderson's narra-
tive is crafted masterfully, with
each twist more surprising than
the last. The authors lull readers
into a false sense of security as
they send their heroes through the
Time Towers. The gang can only
pass through the Tower of Mid-
night at midnight. Obviously. And
the Tower of One in the Morning
can only be passed through at 1
a.m. But as Captain Triangle and
his two tag-alongs step into the
Tower of Two in the Morning,
something goes horribly wrong.
Savings Time takes hold and they
are trapped in the time tower for

an entire hour, waiting for it to be
2 a.m. once more.
This time in the tower is where
the authors' renowned dialogue
truly shines. Such lines as "Gee,
it's boring in here" and "What time
is it?" really make the characters
come to life.
If the novel has any flaw, it's that
the Triforce Saga isn't progressed
at all. Captain Triangle still hasn't
really learned how to use the Wii-
Mote, and he goes the entire book
without finding the Master Sword.
Also, Merlin keeps shouting PK
fire for no apparent reason, negat-
ing the character development and
leveling up we saw him go through
in the lastbook.
But hopefully those plotlines
and more will be fleshed out in
next work in the series, "Pillars
of Noon." And maybe Robin Hood'
will finally recover from his amne-
sia and realize he's an archer, not a
halberdier.

EPISODE REVIEW

After a fantasy-filled Britney
Spears episode, "Glee" returned this
week with atribute
to faith: "Grilled*
Cheesus." When
Finn (Cory Monte- Glee
ith) finds Jesus on
his grilled cheese Season tWO
sandwich, New "Grilled
Directions starts Cheesus"
a dialogue on God
and the role of FOX
religion. Though
many glee clubbers find comfort in
the divine, Kurt (Chris Colfer) stands
alone despite his friends' dismay and
his comatose father.
"Glee" has a hard time straddling
the line between happy-go-lucky
fun and real emotional issues, but
its tough episodes tend to be the

best. "Grilled Cheesus" will join
"Home" and "Wheels" as the epi-
sodes with heart. For once, Rachel
(Lea Michelle) isn't self-absorbed as
she sings "Papa, Can You Hear Me?"
at Burt Hummel's (Mike O'Malley)
bedside.With this and a gospel song,
"Glee" seems to moving away from
campy fantasy musical numbers,
giving them actual context.
Still, the season is three episodes in
and the story has yet to progress past
the first episode when new charac-
ters were introduced. The gimmicky
Britney Spears episode made for great
music and this provocative religious'
episode gave the series some soul, but

Why do we dress
to impress?

The four elements of b-boying are toprock
B-BOY
From Page 1B
focuses on individual dancer
development through instruction-
al leadership and workshops for
beginners.
"We have our group out here
to show the different aspects of
it, like the actual art of b-boying,"
Kim said. "This is not simply
about fancy moves, this is not sim-
ply about impressing the crowd,
this is a dance and this is special
to oneself."
The overly bombastic depic-
tions of breakdancing in film
and media are rather different
from the ideals of breakdanc-
ing espoused in Element 1, which
seeks to spread b-boying and
other funk dance styles as true
art. At the same time, though,
increased exposure of the art
form has helped Element 1 remain
 popular at the University.
"If there's something good that
comes out of that, it's that some of
the negative perspective of b-boy-
ing dies down," Kim said. "People
won't see it as an 'only people that
are up to no good' type of dance."
Kim added that flashy depic-
tions of b-boying have created a
false standard for the real thing.
"That's actually the opposite of
what b-boying is aboutthe said.
"The spinning on the head and all
that is really nice and fancy, and
if you can do it, use it. But people
mistake it. People lack that under-
standing of the art itself."
The Basics
There are four main elements to
every b-boying routine: toprock,
downrock (sometimes simply
referred to as "footwork"), freeze
and power moves.
Every b-boy's routine starts
with toprock - moves performed
standing up. Toprock is broad: It
can involve anything from foot-
work to interacting with the
crowd, but it sets up the rest of the
routine by establishing the danc-
er's style. With toprock, dancers
have a unique opportunity to dis-
play their own personality and dif-
ferentiate themselves.
"Toprock is like a way to kill
time before you go down into the
more complicated stuff," Kao said.
At the same time, toprock is the
basis behind all of b-boying. If
your toprock isn't good, usually
your footwork and your power and
your freezes aren't good. It's the
foundation that everything else
sets up on."
After toprock, the dancer drops
to the floor, and there commenc-
es downrock, a display of quick
footwork and handwork, with
the dancer's weight supported
by hands and feet at different
moments.
The dancer performs freezes at
his or her own discretion. (a well
known technique that shows off
full body strength.) Freezes are
performed to match the beat of
the music; for example, a one-sec-
ond break in a song might be met
with a one-second freeze before
the music's return sends the danc-
er back into downrock.
The fourth element, power
moves, require experience and

a mastery of the other elements.
Many power moves involve spin-
ning of some sort, whether it's a
"headspin" or a "windmill" or a
"flare." The dancer puts his or her
upper-body strength on display
while torquing with the lower
body.
Two other important forms of
dance that many b-boys explore
are popping and locking. While
not technically considered b-boy-
ing, popping and locking are often
assumed to be under the umbrella
of breakdancing, and Element 1
includes all three in its purview.
Popping involves the rapid con-
traction and relaxation of mus-
cles, which is sustained for a full
song. Locking is distinct in that
it features dancers "locking" into

downrock, freeze and power moves.
position before moving to another
position before doing the same.
Both are precise, full-body dance
styles.
Like other forms of art and
dance, b-boying has a culture sur-
rounding it - a culture clear in
environments like this past week-
end's festival.
"It's a dance, but there's defi-
nitely a subculture," said LSA
sophomore and Element 1 Vice
President Jason Do. "It's also the
type of music, the songs - the hip
hop, the rap - that we use."
B-boying attire is another part
of its subculture, but Do sees it as
more practical than anything else.
"For attire, it's really about com-
fortability and how well you can
move in it," he said.
Some of the garb worn by the
participants at Element 1 meetings
is also determined by the type of
dance they are trying to explore.
For example, Do pointed out a
few dancers wearing beanies with
specially designed padding on the
front.
"Those are headspin caps," he
said. "They're actually designed
for spinning on your head."
Those who can
do, teach
Fancy stuff aside, Element 1
starts its new members on the
basics.w
Element 1 meetings are open
to anybody - not just members
who sign up at the beginning of
the semester - and dancers from

novice to expert are welcomed.
Element 1 offers many instruc-
tional resources, including begin-
ner workshops at every meeting.
The group's leaders are quick to
mention the rewards they get from
teaching others.
"Teaching other people, you
strengthen your fundamentals,"
Do said. "It's always good to go
back to basics. I know it's also good
to give back, to get more people
involved. Bringing them into it,
they get to learn part of the cul-
ture."
"Certain b-boys, they can go in
the wrong direction," Kim said.
"They forget their foundation in
a way, and it's actually the most
important thing."
In one workshop a few weeks
ago, the dedication to develop-
ing newcomers was clear. On this
day, Kim and Do were teaching
the basics, starting with toprock,
and showing a few ways for danc-
ers to go down into downrock. Kim
demonstrates a technique called
the "knee drop," which looks far
easier than it is in practice. The
move involves jabbing one's foot
into the back of the knee before
falling down on that foot and keep-
ing one's balance on the floor. He
sent it around the circle, and some
found more success than others.
Next, Do exhibited a standing-
up hip-spin that corkscrewed his
body down to the floor and sent his
feet swinging out into downrock.
Newer dancers had trouble with
Downrock, but there was no lack
of effort or casual acceptance of

difficulty.
The last thing Kim and Do
taught the newcomers - a freeze
- seemed especially difficult with-
out prior experience. It started
with a stab, which requires the
dancer to place his or her hand flat
on the floor, and keep the forearm
perfectly perpendicular to it while
jabbing their elbow into the side.
Each dancer uses that arm to
elevate his or her body, using the
other arm to form a "platform"
while lifting both legs into the air.
Many of the beginners had a tough
time keeping their bodies elevated,
but Element l's leaders patiently
persisted until each dancer got his
or her feet up.
After going through a few work-
shops, Zaras said she was happy to
be learning the basics from other
students.
"I think they're really good,"
she said. "People volunteer them-
selves, which is really nice."
On her future with b-boying,
she wasn't quite sure how far she'd
go.
"I don't know about perfor-
mance," she said. "ButI want to get
good."
Element 1 values that self-
motivation. The group shows that
b-boying is more than a simple
crowd pleaser; it is a genuine form
of art that's just as important to
the dancer alone as to a crowded
room of spectators. With orwith-
out a stage, each b-boying routine
is an expression of personal atti-
tude and style, and a unique cre-
ation in movement.

overflowing with trendy choices,
none of which remotely resemble
ratty gym clothing or worn sleep-
wear. Would all that stuff really
be gone if the rest of the world
told her it was OK to dress like a
slob? And that got me thinking:
What really drives us as a society
to dress the way we do and not in
comfort-conscious loincloths and
furry hats?
It's a valid question. In fact it's,
like, the only question the fash-
ion industry rides on. How much
money are we willing to spend
on these pieces of uncomfort-
ably sewn cloth? We buy maga-
zines that tell us that military
and metallics are in this season
and that we should measure the
amount of peanut butter we put
on our sandwiches so that we can
lose those extra ten pounds off
our butts. And then there's my
favorite little gem: 80 percent
of all women are wearing the
wrong bra size. What the hell
is this even supposed to mean?
That we're too stupid to figure
out what's most comfortable on
us? Yeah, those manufacturers
at Victoria's Secret sure know
us well - much better than we
know ourselves.
So maybe it's true. Maybe the
underlying factor for all of us
wearing "fashionable clothing"
is social constraints. Take places
like New York. The main rea-
son the people there are so well
dressed is because they come
into contact with thousands of
people on the street every day.
In order to stand out - or maybe
even just to keep up - people
have to pay attention to what's
in or out. Because there are so
many people, the cut and style
of a piece of clothing, no mat-
ter how ragingly uncomfortable
it may be, ends up defining the
person underneath.
Obviously, this is not just lim-
ited to clothing. Anything we
own, whether it's furniture, elec-
tronics or bathroom supplies, has
some sort of status symbol built
into it. Take it as sign of our bur-
geoning civilization, or the wid-
ening gap between third world
countries and the richest ones -

we've just become obsessed with
buying fashionable stuff.
But this explanation still feels
incomplete. Generally, your pri-
mary criterion for buying a couch
is not how fashionable it is, but
whether you can sit comfortably
on it. In fashion, this is obviously
not the case, as my small-footed
brethren in Qing-dynasty China
can tell you. But why?
Let's try moving this to more
personal territory - Why do I
wear the stuff I do instead of
Snuggies and Uggboots? For me,
it's all about the feelings associ-
ated with the things ISwear. If I
take a reasonable amount of time
out of my day to put on clothes
that I bought and like, I'm going
to feel better about doing produc-
.tive stuff for the rest of the day.
People put on clothes the same
reason they go to the gym or eat
breakfast: It freshens up their
morning. Staying in pajamas all
day makes me feel like I'm sick
or at a sleepover, which is really
not the way I want to feel when
I'm stressfully studying for a bio-
chem exam.
Beauty is another factor. As
every psychology study has told
us a billion times, people are just
drawn to beautiful things. Babies
would rather be cuddled by big-
breasted blonde bombshells than
their own mothers. Subjects in
studies routinely dub beautiful
people nicer, smarter and all
those other awesome adjectives.
Like magpies to a gold mine, we
Comfort plays

but that's fine.
just can't get enough of pretty
stuff. It's like the hidden third
law of thermodynamics or some-
thing.
And the point is, nobody
can really pinpoint why we've
evolved into fashion-mongers.
Yes, the concept of the entire
industry is completely ridiculous,
but you know what? It works.
Whether it's for pure aestheti-
cism, peer pressure or just to
start out your day, fashion has
stepped out to the forefront of
our culture with almost no expla-
nation for its phenomenon.
So the next time you run
your hands over those madden-
ingly uncomfortable, ridiculously
expensive stiletto boots, buy
them. Who cares if they're going
to make your toes bleed and
ankles break? They're awesome
and you deserve them.

We asked the people of Ann Arbor
what they think about graffiti.
Here's what they had to say.
As told to Carly Steinberger 11 Daily Arts Writer

Graffiti is kind of
rebellious. Everyone is

In Ann Arbor,
graffiti takes on a
positive, activist role
By BRAD SANDERS
Daily Arts Writer
When the four pillars of hip hop
were established in the 1970s in
the Bronx, graffiti was all about
glory. Youth in rebellion against
society and the law would run
wild in the night streets, spraying
their name up wherever people
were likely to see it. In Ann Arbor,
the art takes on a decidedly differ-
ent slant. While a few locals still
take pride in tagging, much of Ann
Arbor's graffiti is about sending a
message and improving the neigh-
borhood.
Local graffiti artist Paolo
Carone, an LSA senior, mostly
uses stencils to create political
messages and purposefully plac-
es them where they will be most
appreciated.
"When I do stencils, it's like
a statement because it's some-
thing you can read and it's short
... something you can get the gist
of," Carone said. "It's like, 'Yes I
think this is unfair and I hope by
reading this you at least consider
that it's unfair too, or you consider
that it's terrible that this is being
ignored.'"
One of his favorite lines to
use is "I will show you fear in a
handful of dust," taken from T.S.
Eliot's "The Waste Land." Carone
has this five-foot tall stencil on a
number of abandoned buildings in
Detroit, including a record store
he liked that was being torn down,
he said.
The dustin the poem represents
a lifeless substance with no fur-
ther meaning, Carone explained,
like the rubble of the demolished
record store.
"It's specifically that there
weren't efforts to save these build-
ings or clean them up or anything,
they were just efforts to get rid of
it and turn it into a parking lot or
just another bank," he said. "There
was no effort for an actual expres-
sive use of this building."
It's the artists who can bring
this expression to life with their
craft. Ellen Rutt, a junior in the
school of Art & Design, painted
a mural on the wall of Univer-
sity Towers apartment building
on South University Avenue that
used to face the old Pinball Pete's
arcade building, which burned
down nearly a year ago.

street mentality."
Rutt didn't have such motiva-
tions. Rather, Rutt hopes to revive
an area marred by destruction and
perhaps even extend her painted
"Garden" beyond the wall.
"In addition to having it be
a mural I think that space has
potential for being an urban gar-
den," Rutt said, adding that she's
in talks with the student group
Cultivating Community about cre-
ating "a community space for both
art and collaboration for environ-
mental reasons."
Eventually, Rutt is open to dif-
ferent murals being displayed
on her newfound space, making
the wall a consistently changing
movement of rebirth after the
damage caused by the fire.
"I want to see what the pos-
sibility is of painting over that
wall every year and having either
myself or someone do a mural
every year," Rutt said. "So it will
be annual and something like this
will exist for a temporary period
of time."
Both Rutt and Carone agree that
street art has a distinct advantage
over the traditional act of painting
on a canvas, transcending closed
walls and reaching a broader and
unsuspecting audience.
"It's one thing to do an image
on a canvas where it's presented
in a gallery or in an art setting,
but that attracts a certain type of
person," Rutt explained. "Public
art can be seen by everyone ... it's
universally accepted or rejected,
in some ways. So that has to be
taken into consideration when
choosing images that you want to
portray."
It's that idea - that graffiti is
best when it serves a community
purpose or sends an important
message - that makes Carone so
disdainful of Graffiti Alley, proba-
bly Ann Arbor's most popular spot
for graffiti artists and viewers.
Beyond the middle-aged man
dressed head to toe in King of Pop
apparel as he swings and sings
through a rendition of "Thriller,"
the Graffiti Alley is, like it or not,
quite a spectacle. It's a veritable
labyrinth of graffiti, strewn with
Beatles lyrics, ancient spray-
painted pieces of gum and even a
Barbie doll strapped to a pole.
"I don't like the painted alley,
because there used to be a mural
there and it was beautiful," Carone
said. "Now it's been painted over
and it's just a mess - it's chaos.
"That thing is so just part of
Ann Arbor that when you do any-
thing around here, no one takes
it seriously," he added. "There's a
blend of all sorts of ideas and good
ideas are covered up by pointless
ones."
For Carone, a good idea is not
necessarily one that sends the
right message, but one that's pro-
vocative enough to incite a strong
reaction, whether it's positive or
negative, political or personal.
"If it makes people think, if all
they have to do is walk past it and
think, it makes the area a better
place."

MARSA MCCLAIN/Da
"The Garden" is a graffiti work designed to bring beauty to a spot that could use it.

"I've seen really cool KELEKI GOTTSCHALK

really crappy graffiti.
I've seen really cool art
and really crappy art. As
long as it doesn't, let's see,
as long as it's notcom-
promising the structural
integrity of something I
don't think it's vandalism.
I think it can be taste-
less and can be put in the
wrong places. Generally,
I think it's cool. If it'swell
done it can add character
to a city."
MICHAEL ANGELO
"I think it's -WAYNE STATE MED STUDENT
one of the old-
est forms of.art....
I like a lot of graf-
fiti, provided it's

certainlyhave the
potential to have

"Once they painted over the
wall (after Pinball Pete's burned
down) it seemed like a really per-
fect opportunity to take advan-
tage of this space that no one was
doing anything with," said Rutt,
who lived in University Towers at
the time.
The mural, called "The Garden,"
features surreal flowers painted
with various vibrant reds, blues and
greens and was completed this past
summer. Rutt painted her name
and contact information next to
the mural. She had no need to hide
her identity, as she gained approval
from the property manager of Uni-
versity Towers beforehand.
"(The property manager) had
me fill out some sort of proposal
and present an idea to her ... just to
make sure it wasn't gang affiliated
or really racist," Rutt said. "While
I was making it, people would
come up and talk to me about it,

ask me what I was doing and why I
was doing it. I had quite a few offi-
cers approach me."
Graffiti has long been crimi-
nalized as an act of vandalism
and defacement of property.
Ann Arbor law penalizes graf-
fiti offenses with restitution, com-
munity service and a fine of up to
$500. In addition, the graffitied
business can pursue civil litiga-
tion. For this reason, many local
graffiti artists wouldn't consent to
being interviewed for this story.
Rutt said she knows people who
engage in illicit tagging in Ann
Arbor.
"People do tons of stuff on
North Campus but it's not nearly
as public as doing it on Central
Campus," Rutt said. "There's a
very distinct group of people who
travel around North Campus."
Carone attributes the act of
tagging to graffiti's urban roots,
where tags would represent ter-
ritories that belonged to certain
gangs.
"There is still that mid-'90s
mentality of ... someone tower-
ing over a certain area or being
the king of something," Carone
said. "I'm not a really big fan
of that way of thinking but it's
really integral - it's like street
advertising, like putting your
band's flier up. It's for a method
of art that came from a street
mentality, and is at its best a
