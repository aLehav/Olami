Social networking
sites spur civic
engagement in A2,
Middle East
By DAVID BUCCILLI
Daily StaffReporter
While people across the world
are using Facebook and Twit-
ter for connecting with friends
or following celebrity news, the
social networkingosites have been
takingon alarger role.
The function of online activ-
ism has come under an increased'
watch recently with the wide-
spread use of various websites to
garnersupporters for the protests
in the Middle East. According to
University professors, social net-
working websites are also chang-
ing the way students participate
in political and social dialogue.
Michael Dobbs, a lecturer of
Communications Studies, said
social media websites like Face-
book and Twitter are "completely
(changing) the game" of activism.

He said this has been illustrated
by these sites' influencing the
recent uprisings in Tunisia and
Egypt.
"Undoubtedly, the Inter-
net and social media played an
important role inbringingpeople
out into the streets," Dobbs said
in an interview this week.
Because people mobilized
through the use of network-
ing sites, Dobbs said, Egyptian
authorities cut off Internet access
from Jan. 28 until Feb. 2.
In addition to the Internet aid-
ing short-term goals like getting
people on the streets to "give
people a voice they didn't have,"
online resources also help pro-
testers achieve long-term goals
like raising global awareness
about torture, Dobbs said.
The Internet makes it "much
easier for an ordinary protestor
to communicate with the outside
world," he said.
But Dobbs pointed out that the
Internet has helped to empower
governments too, specifically by
allowing officials to track people
through photos and social net-

Passed almost one year ago,
the Affordable Health Care
Act aims to make health insur-
ance more attainable to United

States citizens, especially col-

the high expense of tuition.
The act's provisions are just

Steve Larsen, director of

U-M WIKIPEDIANS
Lending a helping e-hand

Many .studentsuse Wikipedia as a
resource for classes, essay and other aca-
demic pursuits. But several University stu-
dents have taken their Wikipedia use one
step further.
This past fall, Rackham student Cher-
yl Moy started U-M Wikipedians - the
first Wikipedia student club in the United
States, according to the Wikimedia Foun-
dation website.
The club, which began as a project in
one of Moy's chemistry classes, garnered
the attention of the Wikimedia Founda-
tion, the non-profit organization respon-
sible for various "Wiki" sites including
Wikipedia, Wikionary and Wikinote.
The club's two dozen members update
Wikipediapages rangingfromscience pol-
icy articles to pages about the University.
The group's. members scours Wikipedia
for errors, omissions and poorly written

articles.
LSA sophomore Charles Zhou, a mem-
ber of U-M Wikipedians, said he has con-
tributed to Wikipedia articles on topics
including University camupus tours and
obscure dung beetles. According to Moy,
the group has also created ten new articles.
Though Zhou said he is not sure how
many articles he has contributed to, he
said he's made at least 200 edits since high
school.
Senior Wikipedians like Zhou help
guide club members with less experience
and explain how to navigate the website
and make contributions.Y
In the fall, the group hosted a talk by
Frank Schulenburg, head of public out-.
reach for the Wikimedia Foundation, '
who gave a presentation about the orga- COURTESTY OF CHARLES ZHOU

Indonesia religious minority
falls victim to violent attacks

Three killed, six
wounded in attack
on worshippers
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)
Indonesia's president ordered
an investigation into an attack
onrinembsiof a minority 'Mus-
lihnsect after a gruesome video
emerged of a mob beating several
victims to death with machetes,
sticks and rocks.
About 1,500 people stormed
a house in Banten province over
the weekend to stop 20 Ahmadi-
yah followers from worship-
ping. They killed three men and
badly wounded six others, while
destroying the house and setting
fire to several cars and motor-
bikes.
Indonesia is a secular country
of 237 million people with more
Muslims than any other in the
world.
Despite a long history of
religious ' tolerance, a hard-
line fringe has grown louder in

recent years and the government
- which relies on the support of
Islamic parties in Parliament -
has been accused of caving in to
it.
Rights group said Tuesday
a 2008 decree that bans reli-
gious activities of Ahmadiyah,
thought to have 200,000 follow-
ers in the archepeligic nation,
should be immediately revoked.
They say it only encourages vio-
lence.
The latest attacks on Ahmadi-
yah - which drew rare con-
demnation from President
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono -
were captured on video and have
circulated widely on national
television and the Internet.
The most disturbing clip, post-
ed on YouTube, showed assail-
ants repeatedly pounding two
victims - who had been stripped
naked and appeared to be dead -
with heavy sticks.
A policeman came to the
scene but his screams of "stop"
were almost inaudible among
dozens who shouted "Allahu

Akbar" or God is Great.
The Ahmadiyah are consid-
ered deviant by many Muslims
and are banned in many Islamic
countries because they believe
that Muhammad was not the
final prophet.
"I have ordered a comprehen-
sive investigation to find out the
real cause of the incident so that
those guilty, or violating the law,
can be penalized," Yudhoyono
told a news conference.
He also called on security
forces as well as local govern-
ments to be proactive in taking
action against the instigators of
such violence.
"Don't wait until the conflicts
and clashes have already hap-
pened," Yudhoyono said.
Many attacks on religious
minorities in recent years have
been carried out by members of
the hardline Islamic Defenders
Front, known also for smashing
bars and attacking transvestites
and anyone one else considered
"blasphemous" with bamboo
clubs and stones.

him more as a mentor than a col-
league. He was extremely help-
ful and receptive as I worked my
way through the ranks at Michi-
gan."
Arnett wrote numerous
articles on accounting and co-
authored seven books after
receiving his Ph.D. from the Uni-
versity of Illinois, according to
Feb. 8 Ross School of Business
press release. Additionally, he
held positions on committees for
several business groups.
Though Arnett retired from
the Business School in 2001, his
legacy of being a fun and good-
hearted educator will continue,
Danos wrote.
"He was what they might
call now 'old school' and I, as a

freshly minted Ph.D. with more
confidence than understanding,
learned to appreciate his wis-
dom and clear thinking," Danos
wrote.
Danos wrote that in the 20
years he and Arnett worked
together, their families became
close and Danos cherished their
friendship.
"Once, we were all driving
together to Ann Arbor from
Mackinac Island after present-
ing a paper to an accounting
meeting," Danos wrote. "He and
my daughter Melissa, five years
old at the time, regaled us for
hours us with their rhymes and
jokes."

Young Professor of Accounting
and one of Arnett's colleagues at

share stories and entertain.

ation "because of the confiden-
tial nature of the complaint."
"The University of Michigan

Three released
after kidnap on
Indian tiger reserve
Separatist militants released
three volunteers from WWF-
India on Tuesday who were
kidnapped two days ago in a
northeast Indian tiger reserve,
but three others were still being
held, local officials said.
Police were questioning the
three Indian women, who were
found in good health wander-
ing out of a dense forest Tuesday
afternoon near the border with
Bhutan after the militants con-
tacted local journalists and told
them of the release, local council
administrator Kampa Borgoyari
said. Reporters were unable to
speak with the women before
police took them away.
Borgoyari refused to say if the
militants made any demands and
denied journalists access to the
women, as authorities work to
free three male volunteers.
The group of six was abducted
Sunday while counting the tiger
population at the Manas Tiger-
Reserve in Assam state. The
park, which spans into neighbor-
ing Bhutan, has a sizable popula-
tion of Royal Bengal tigers and
wild Asiatic elephants.

Judge dismisses
Air Force Academy
prayer lawsuit
A federal judge has dismissed a
lawsuit seeking to block a prayer
luncheon at the Air Force Acad-

U.S. District Judge Christine
Arguello ruled Wednesday in
Denver. She says associate pro-
fessor David Mullin and a watch-
dog group, the Military Religious
Freedom Foundation, didn't show
they had legal standing to bring
the suit.
They alleged the event vio-
lates the constitutional separa-
tion of church and state because
it appears to be sponsored by the
academy itself, and because Mul-

lin and other faculty members
believe they'll face retribution if
they don't attend, even though it's
officially voluntary.
Following the judge's ruling,
the academy's chaplain agreed
to make it clear at the start of the
luncheon that it's an event spon-
sored by the chapel, not the acad-
Uemy as a whole.

HEALTH CARE
From Page 1A
likely to be uninsured than
other age groups, Larsen said.
Roughly 5 percent of Uni-
versity undergraduates and 10
percent of graduate students
are without health insurance,
according to a Jan. 19 Michigan
Daily article.
However, provisions in the
new act will give students a
"peace of mind," Larsen said,
since dependents are now
allowed to stay on their par-
ents' health insurance plans
until age 26.
Three million students are
currently covered under stu-
dent health care plans through
their college or university, but
many of these plans limit what
is covered and which doctors
individuals may visit, Larsen
said.
The University offers an
optional health insurance plan
for domestic students and a

mandatory plan for interna-
tional students, the Jan. 19
Daily article reported.
Approximately 1,400 stu-
dents are currently enrolled in
the domestic plan, which costs
$224.83 per month, according
to the article.
However, the new health
care law will guarantee that
students receive the same
health care as other demo-
graphics, which gives "stu-
dents and young people more
control over their health care,"
he said.
The changes impact anyone
enrolled ina U.S.-based health
care plan, including interna-
tional students, Larsen said.
Aaron Smith, executive
director of Young Invincibles
- an organization that works
to make the cost of health
care more reasonable for col-
lege students - said in the
conference call that the act
represents a "major victory
for college students and their
families.

"Theavailabilityof affordable
health care has been something
students have been requesting
for years," Smith said.
Eight out of nine colleges
surveyed were found to have a
clause in their insurance plans
that excluded students with
pre-existing conditions, Smith
said, but the new act will pre-
vent this.
In a world where 15 percent
of adults have a chronic medi-
cal condition, Smith said, "all it
takes is one accident or illness
to rack up thousands of dollars
in debt."
He added that this kind of
debt often forces students to
drop out of college.
With the new act, 80 percent
of every dollar a person spends
on premiums will go to health
care coverage, as opposed to
the current percentages, which
often fall between 20 and
50 percent, Smith said. This
change, and others like free
preventive care, will begin to
take place in 2012, he said.

ACTIVISM

works. Because the Egyptian
government has power over the
media, Dobbs added, police there
have used Facebook and Twit-
ter to obtain information about
citizens. He also cited China as an
example of a government's "filter-
ing" of the Internet
"The new information technol-
ogy has changed the nature of the
game," Dobbs said, adding that
it's often ambiguous which side
of conflicts benefits more from
online resources.
Regardless, Dobbs said the
Internet plays a pivotal role'in
communicating information
quickly - a function he said is
vital for any form of activism or
protest.
"All revolution in the end
becomes an information revolu-
tion," he said.
Thomas Finholt, professor and
senior associate dean at the Uni-
versity's School of Information,
said in an interview in November
that social media also help engage
students in political dialogue.
"What the Internet offers is
a new halfway engagement," he
said. "People previously, doing
nothing now are involved."
In addition to keeping people
informed and involved, social
media websites serve as a check on
power, Dobbs said, citing Egyp-
tian activists' using cell phones to
document police corruption.
"They smuggle in cell phones
in the police station and surrepti-
tiously take photos," he said.;
Finholt also said cell phones
have become important tools for
political activism closer to home.
He spoke specifically of "flash
mobs," saying that such technol-
ogy allows students to spontane-
ously organize protests, an option
that wasn't available in previous
decades.
"(With mobile devices) it
becomes possible to organize
activity more spontaneously," Fin-
holt said. "A lot of activism in the

past was pre-mobilized."
LSA senior Mallory Jones,
chair of the University's under-
graduate chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union and a for-
mer news editor for The Michi-
gan Daily, said using Facebook
and blogs from local, state and
national chapters are great ways
to distribute information to ACLU
members.
"Even justthrough Facebook, it
is just so much easier to be aware
of things going on," Jones said.
People who are too busy to
attend University ACLU meet-
ings can still keep abreast of the
group's proceedings through
online forums, she added.
LSA junior Brendan Campbell,
chair of the University's chapter of
College Democrats, said new tech-
nologies are an effective way for
student activists to spread their
missions and connectsupporters.
Campbell said College Demo-
crats use online outlets like You-
Tube, video podcasts, Twitter and
bloggingtocomplementmore con-
ventional forms of participation.
Though online media help stu-
dents, Finholt said, they also pro-
duce a sense of disengagement
from the activities themselves.
University students in the past
participated in events like protests
and anti-war marches, whereas
now, students partake in causes
online, which Finholt said limits
actual involvement.
"From the point of view of the
individual, clicking a mouse on a
website isn't very motivating or
engaging," Finholt said. "The 60s
and 70s had a much more public,
in-your-face exposure."
Student activists during those
times had more "aggressive com-
mentary," Finholt said, because
of their desire to defy norms and
expectations of older generations.
Jones said she doesn't believe
online activism can completely
substitute in-person activism.
"Being there in person is still
the heart of activism," Jones said.
"You're always going to see people
on the Diag ... and the Internet's
riot going to replace that."


MPOWERED

porations, Holtz said. However,
the fair hopes to combat this by
bringing in local businesses that
desire to recruit Michigan stu-
dents.
"One of the main goals of
the fair is to show students
that there are more opportuni-
ties outside of corporate orga-
nizations," Holtz said in an
interview last week. "We want
to help make Ann Arbor the
entrepreneurial hub of the Mid-
west, and this is one of the only
opportunities for small com-
panies to meet students in this
fashion."
Working for an entrepre-
neurial company can provide
students with hands on experi-
ence that allows them to have a
direct impact on the company,
Holtz said.
LSA junior Ankit Mehta, the
president of MPowered, said
the organization believes there
are three ways to foster entre-
preneurship: opening the door
for opportunities, inspiring
students to do business and sup-
porting students who start their
own businesses.
The fair hosted many tech-
nology and business companies
and was open to students of
all majors. The most job open-
ings were in fields involving
engineering; graphic design,
accounting and marketing. The
University's Medical Innova-
tion Center was also present at
the fair and student-run com-
panies made up one-fifth of the
companies in attendance.
Students had the opportu-

nity to introduce themselves
to a multitude of companies,
including MENLO Innovations
- an Ann Arbor-based company
that designs software. MENLO
Innovations CEO Richard Sher-
idan said at the event that he
enjoys being involved with the
career fair.
"The MPowered Career Fair
is a great opportunity that gives
small companies tremendous
exposure," he said.
Amy Klinke, the assistant
director for small company ini-
tiatives at the University's Cen-
ter for Entrepreneurship and
Business Engagement Center,
said she became involved with
MPowered because she felt
there was a need for small com-
panies to meet and hire Univer-
sity students.
Prior to the career fair it
was hard for small businesses
to personally interact with and
recruit students. To meet this
need, Klinke said, MPowered
helped advocate for the devel-
opment of the Center for Entre-
preneurship.
"MPowered and the career
fair create a multifaceted expe-
rience for students where they
can meet and learn about small
startup companies," Klinke
said.
Mehta said he joined MPow-
ered during his freshman year
so he could gain real-world
entrepreneurial experience.
The fair provides an opportu-
nity for MPowered members
and other students to network
with small businesses and get
job leads.
"It is a great way to talk to
startup companies and draws
in a cool mix of people to make

it different from a normal
career fair," Mehta said in an
interview this week. "There are
people there looking to build
ideas."
Working for these smaller
companies provides an oppor-
tunity to channel what students
have learned in the classroom,
Mehta said.
"MPowered is operated like
a start-up company and is an
organization where skills are
transferable," he said. "There
are students at the fair who
want to learn from each other
and make an impact."
LSA junior Linda Chang
said she took advantage of the
opportunity to talk to potential
employers at the career fair.
"I had heard about the fair
and compiled a list of compa-
nies I was interested in and then
looked at their websites," Chang
said. "I was then able to talk to
them at the fair."

Bing's housing intiative can repopulate Detroit
ith its population dropping below 1 million, Detroit is
becoming less and less centralized. To help reverse this
trend and create a cohesive municipality, Detroit Mayor
Dave Bing introduced a plan last week that would encourage police
officers and other city employees to move within city limits. In order
to build better police community relations and to improve the con-
nection between public servants and the city where they work, Bing's
plans should proceed unhindered. If this program proves to be as suc-
cessful as Bing hopes, officials should use the Neighborhood Stabili-
zation Fund to invest in other housing projects that would encourage
more people to migrate to Detroit.

a

According to Detroit officials, more than
50 percent of Detroit police officers live out-
side the city's limits. Detroit is in possession of
an abundance of foreclosed and repossessed
real estate. The experimental program Bing
is introducing is an effort to simultaneously
address these two facets. In an attempt to bring
police officers back into the city, the proposal
will provide funds to renovate these derelict
homes which will then be sold to police offi-
cers for as little as $1,000. The funds for this
project are a part of the Neighborhood Stabili-
zation Fund from the federal government, and
no part of the program will be funded by tax
dollars, according to a Feb. 7 freep.com article.
While it's important to help families
already living in Detroit, putting money into
dilapidated, rundown homes isn't cost effec-
tive. Bing's plan will help improve the real
estate in the city twofold - it will improve
the houses and housing market through res-
toration and renovation, and it will fill empty
houses that are contributing no money in
property taxes. Filling empty houses with
police officers will decrease crime in Detroit
neighborhoods.
Until 1999, the state law stated that all city
employees had to be residents of Detroit. But a
law that mandates Detroit residency for public
service will deter people from working for the

city. Rather than reinstating a law similar to
the one that ended in 1999 and risking losing
city employees, Bing's plan will create posi-
tive incentives to get its employees back in the
city. This will help build community relations
between the city's government and the city's
residents, which will provide a more unified
municipality.
The pilot program is only the first step in
the many necessary for Detroit's recovery.
Even though police officers are going to help
fill vacant houses and maintain a presence
within the city, there is still going to be a sig-
nificant lack of tenancies. In order to help
improve infrastructure and stave off foreclo-
sure, Detroit should consider formulating a
land bank similar to the Genesse County Land
Bank, which would also qualify for funding
from the Neighborhood Stabilization Fund.
A land bank could help intervene on behalf
of families facing economic hardships, and.
underwrite abandoned properties in order to
distribute them to responsible developers and
owners.
Detroit needs new innovations and ideas to
reinvigorate the city. There are many avenues
that Bing can take to improve Detroit, and fol-
lowing the success of this program, new infra-
structure and a land bank would be the logical
next step.

My older brother despises
the movie "Grandma's
Boy." He's a 27-year old
video game pro-
ducer in San
Francisco, Calif.
who works for
Electronic Arts.
whenever I tell
anyone about his
job the most com-
mon response is,
"Oh, you mean JEREMY
like in 'Grand- LEVY
ma's Boy'?" For
those of you who
are unfamiliar, "Grandma's Boy" is
the 2006 movie about an adult game
designer who lives in his grandma's
basement with his geeky design
team. The movie is pretty indicative
of what people tend to imagine when
they hear the phrase "video game."
But let's contrast that image with a
different one. This summer, my friend
Daniel developed a Facebook Scrabble
rivalry with my other friend's mother,
Mrs. Hanrahan. The two could play
each other with their iPhones over
the course of several days. This is the
same mother who used to tell us to
eat more fruit and go playoutside. But
now, Daniel could expect trash talk
whenever he walked into the Hanra-
han household.
The video game world is current-
ly going through big changes, and
whether you realize it or not, you've
probably already taken part. Sure,
there is still a large market for games
that attract Dungeons and Dragons
aficionados and fraternity guys, but
the industry is continually looking
to attract a wider audience. We can
see it in the rise of online games like
Bejewelled and Farmville, active
games on the Nintendo Wii and
novelties like Guitar Hero. Accord-
ing to Ph.D. and game designer Jane

McGonigal, 69 percent of all heads
of households play computer games
or video games and 40 percent of all
gamers are women.
Yet, the "Grandma's Boy" image
still persists, and what's more,
games - both those for casual and
intense users - are continually
viewed as a waste of time or a dis-
traction at best. In her new book,
"Reality is Broken," McGonigal
argues that common perceptions of
video games are flat-out wrong, cit-
ing research showing that gaming is
often very beneficial. She goes as far
as to say that games can offer peo-
ple many things that the real world
can't and that gaming's new mass
appeal shows how reality is broken.
Take what you will from someone
who has worked in the industry,
but McGonigal does provide lots of
useful information that challenges
common perceptions about the role.
of video games in society.
As evidenced in the anecdote.
above, games like iPhone Scrabble
are helping to shape relationships
by providing new forums for social
interaction (bear with me here).
As with Facebook, these interac-
tions obviously aren't a substitute
for the face-to-face interactions
people experience with those close
to them. But games likely forge new
relationships that would hardly be
commonplace in any other scenario
- like competition between a col-
lege student and his friend's mother.
As McGonigal puts it, "If you haven't
pwned your Mom, you're clearly
missing out."
Another useful piece of research
shows that people who play games
during work breaks are more
refreshed than those who participate
in activities that are less mentally
strenuous like watching Internet
videos. When faced with a challenge

in a video game, participants can see
the direct outcome of their actions,
which makes games more satisfy-
ing than real work in which one's
individual agency to effect outcomes
is more diffuse. This psychological
benefit has spillover effects - games
make real work more enjoyable. In
fact, McGonigal sites a study from
the University of Hamburg that
found "70 percent of (high-level
executives) regularly play casual
computer games while working."
Video games are
much more than
a societal blight.
In a column at.. the beginning
of the school year, I argued that
socially conservative critiques of
technological change are frequently
reactionary. If you listen to people's
arguments against Facebook or
BBM, they point out things that are
different from the past more often
than things that are clearly negative
for society. I believe video games
serve as the ultimate example of this
phenomenon.
But the research is real and robust
- games are much more than a
drain on our societal well-being, and
more people play them than ever
before. While there are drawbacks
to mass game consumption, the ben-
efits are too often overlooked. Games
aren't just for the realm of low-life
grandma's boys, and you could save
yourself some stress if you stopped
thinking about them as such.

Let WikiLeaks peak

The first time I heard of WikiLeaks was back in
December 2010 when news broke out that the organiza-
tion leaked United States diplomatic cables to the public.
My first reaction was alarm: What a breach of national
security! Who's behind this? Isn't this espionage? Those
responsible must be punished!
But as I obsessively followed the news on WikiLeaks,
my mind changed.
First, it hasn't broken any laws so it hasn't commit-
ted espionage - many will argue that WikiLeaks is, by
legal definition, a journalistic organization whose rights
to publish state secrets are protected by the rulings from
New York Times v. United States.
Second, they haven't "dumped" 251,287 cables. They
partnered with five media organizations including the
New York Times, the Guardian, Le Monde, l Pais, and
Der Spiegel, which selected which cables to publish.
Those publications then redacted the cables as necessary
and sent them back for WikiLeaks to publish. Therefore,
only about 3,000 of the 250,000 documents have been
published so far and no grave national security concerns
have been raised.
Third, WikiLeaks revealed serious issues in U.S.
diplomacy.
Perhaps those who closely follow international history
and news already knew most of what's detailed in the
cables, but the public - the people who are supposed to
monitor government activity'- weren't aware. Does the
public know that the U.S. State Department ordered its
diplomats to collect credit card numbers, passwords, fin-
gerprints and even DNA from the United Nations leader-
ship? That oil giant Shell claimed it had inserted staff into
key positions in the Nigerian government? That the U.S.
partnered with China to make sure that little gets accom-
plished at Copenhagen? That U.S. tax dollars have been
used to fund child sex slavery in Afghanistan?
The cables also revealed many actions done in the
name of "national security." One example concerns Tuni-
sia. Those paying attention to international news know'
that Tunisia recently had a massive uprising that resulted
in its president of 24 years fleeing the country. The dip-
lomatic cables show that the State Department knew of
the Tunisian president's corrupt acts as early as 2006,
but because of Tunisia's support for the War on Ter-
ror the government did little to address the concerns of

oppressed citizens. This resulted in anti-American sen-
timents among Tunisians, who thought their resistance
would be futile since the U.S. would aid President of the
Tunisian Republic Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to the end.
Similar events occurred in Egypt. Egypt President
Hosni Mubarak has held his post for 30 years and is
widely known for his cruel rule. But because of his sup-
port for the War on Terror, the U.S. viewed that it could
do little to advance real democracy in Egypt. In the end,
this behavior has fostered anti-American sentiments
among Egyptians who see U.S. support for Mubarak. The
billions of dollars in foreign aid spent in buying U.S. cor-
porations' military equipment don't help either.
The pattern is clear: counter-terrorism efforts are rais-
ing anti-American sentiments.
Tom Malinowski, Washington Director for Human
Rights Watch and an expert in U.S. foreign policy,
writes on foreignpolicy.com that WikiLeaks "did more
for Arab democracy than decades of backstage U.S.
diplomacy." He also mentions that cynicism runs ram-
pant in the State Department. His diplomatic friends
often say something along the lines of, "Sure, our dip-
lomatic engagement with country X won't make human
rights better, but neither will sanctions or public criti-
cism or anything else."
This cynicism isn't only unnecessary, but harmful.
The Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings against their
oppressive governments show that those people want
real democracy, and any effort to stymie it, no matter
how well intentioned, may ultimately harm U.S. inter-
ests in the long term.
The revelations show that many actions are taken in
the name of the United Stateswithout its citizens' knowl-
edge of exactly what the actions entail. Do we want to let
the world think that we don't support democracy? That
we would support dictators and let millions of people suf-
fer, all in the name of U.S. national security?
Perhaps Benjamin Franklin was right when he said,
"He who sacrifices freedom for security deserves nei-
ther." This judgment is up to the people to decide - all
the raw material is available on the Internet. The truth is
the best disinfectant, and I'm only thankful to WikiLeaks
for its commitment to it.

Senior Muresan within striking distance
of program record for career simgles wins

By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
Sometimes, an injury can
make or break a collegiate ath-
letic career.
Many recruiters, unsure of an
athlete's future, choose not to
take the risk.
But almost four years ago,
the Michigan women's tennis
program did - and now senior
Denise Muresan has the chance
to change the record books for-
ever.
The senior is just 12 wins
away from breaking the program
record for career singles wins.
Former Wolverine Chisako
Sugiyama holds the current
record with 104 wins; Muresan
currently sits at the No. 5 slot
with 93.
Michigan coach Ronni Ber-
nstein explained that despite
being a star in juniors, Muresan
was injured during the collegiate
recruitment process, so many
would not have guessed she
would be standing where she is
today.
"I think a lot of schools were
unsure," Berstein said of Mure-
san's ability to successfully
compete at the collegiate level.
"When you have someone com-
ing off an injury you really don't
know where she can get to."
Breaking a Michigan record
didn't even seem to be on the
table.
But Muresan always knew she
had it in her.
"A lot of maturing off of the
court helped me play better on
the court," Muresan said. "Just
to relax and have more fun with
the sport is what ultimately

helped me to reach those goals.
I have a lot of confidence in
myself."
Staring down the singles
record is not the first time Mure-
san has come face to face with
making history in the Michigan
women's tennis program.
During the 2009-10 season,
the Illinois native earned All-
American honors - the first
Wolverine to do so since Marian
Kremer in 1981- and was named
Big Ten Player of the Year.
"At the end of our (2009-10)
season, we didn't have as good of
a finish as we wanted to - even
me individually," Muresan said.
"After I got All-American, it was
just really exciting. That entire
year I was trying to believe in
myself, that I belonged at the
top. After the season that we
had, it gave me the confidence to
know that I belonged there."
As one of four seniors current-
ly on the team's roster, Muresan
has buillt close ties with many
of her teammates - especially
senior Kari Whig.
Whig calls Muresan "com-
petitive and fiery," yet funny and
kind, emphasizing that despite
being the 11th-ranked competi-
tor at No. 1 singles, she's com-
pletely different once her feet
leave the court and her racket is
away.
"I remember when we were
freshman, we didn't know each
other very well," Whig said. "I'd
seen her off the court and she
was so nice. Then the first time
we played points against each
other ... I was shocked."
Muresan has built quite the.
career for herself, working her
way up the ranks over the past

Senior Denise Muresan is 12 wins away from the program's singles record.

three years. As a freshman, she
kicked off her career at the No.
5 singles slot, reaching a steady
position at No. 1 by her junior
year.
Currently 3-1 this season,
Muresan is just 12 wins away
from taking Sugiyama's title as
the Wolverine with the most
career singles wins. After a
2009-10 record of 18-8, a career
winning percentage of .699 and

at least 16 more matches this sea-
son, she has a fighting chance.
"It doesn't really faze her,"
Bernstein said of Muresan's
current successes. "Denise has
always had a ton of confidence in
herself. Every time she steps out
on the court, she feels like she
can win the match."
Bernstein hopes the next 12
times Muresan steps out on the
court, she's right.

From Page 5A
Caporusso and junior David
Wohlberg - was also a contrib-
uting factor in the restructur-
ing, since over time a line can
become stale and lose its former
luster from when it was initially
formed.
Even with the offensive-jug-
gling effort, Michigan (14-7-1-0
CCHA, 17-9-4 overall) isn't over-
ly concerned about its inability
to produce the last few games.
According to Brown, the Wolver-
ines have the players and talent
to put pucks in the net and devel-
op into the offensive juggernaut
it's capable of becoming on any
given night.

Morgan explodes for career-high
By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Writer

Burns comments on
Saad's departure to
European pro league

It was only fitting that Jor-
dan Morgan snatched the final
rebound of Wednesday night's
game against Northwestern.
And it was only fitting that the
redshirt freshman forward did it
with authority.
The same player that came into
the matchup averaging 7.3 points
in Big Ten contests - the same
player who Michigan coach John
Beilein said was spending too
much time acting like an assis-
tant coach, since he was so often
relegated to the bench with bouts
of foul trouble - had the perfor-
mance of a lifetime in the Wolver-
ines' 75-66 victory.
Morgan busted out for a
career-high 27 points, topping
his previous totals of 20 and 23
points recorded earlier this sea-
son. Those performances came
against Gardner Webb and NAIA
squad Concordia, respectively
- this one came against a tough
Wildcat team that blew Michigan
out just three weeks ago.
"He did a marvelous job of fin-
ishing," assistant coach Bacari
Alexander said. "You knew that
day would come, you just didn't
know when it would come. I'm
really happy for Jordan's success
today."
All season long, Beilein and
Alexander have talked about how
Morgan is learning and develop-
ing into the physical post pres-
ence the Wolverines sorely need
and have lacked for several years.
On Wednesday night, the
Detroit native finally validated
his coaches' faith.
"It kind of just got rolling,"
Morgan said. "A couple things fell
my way ... It's not so much wait-
ing (to break out) as realizing
that (the ability's) there, and just
pushing myself to do the best that
I can on every possession, defen-
sively and offensively.

Redshirt freshman Jordan Morgan scored a career-high 27 points in last night's win over Northwestern.

"(I) just (want to) show people
that I can play."
Morgan thrived all nightwork-
ing the pick-and-roll with sopho-
more point guard Darius Morris.
On defense, Northwestern typi-
cally switches, letting screeners
slip off their picks.
And the Wildcats - like Michi-
gan's last two opponents - put
more of an emphasis on locking
down the Wolverines' shooters.
As a result, Morgan constantly
found himself open rolling to the
basket or slipping past defenders
while cuttingto the hoop. Morris
consistently found him, and the
big man finished.
"Darius is a great passer, and
lot's of times, he's a passer first,"
Morgan said. "He's just recogniz-
ing (on) switches that I was going
to be under the basket. He trusted
me to finish them, and I came
through for him."
The Wolverines rarely look

inside for offense this season, but
the team's first points on Wednes-
day came from agive to Morgan.
"After we ran a couple of our
normal plays, once I got to the
lane, it was like two people or
three people (collapsing) on me,"
Morris said. "The right play was
(to) Jordan Morgan.
"They didn't adjust, and he just
kept making layups."
And the forward closed the
first half with a flourish. After
receiving a pass from freshman
guard Tim Hardaway Jr., Morgan
accidentally hit the ball off the
backboard.
But it came right back to him
- just another indication it was
Morgan's night - and he put it
back to give him his 17th point
and Michigan the 34-19 halftime
lead.
Northwestern slowed him
down slightly in the second half,
but only by fouling him on all his

strong takes to the basket and
sending him to the line for five
free throw attempts.
When the Wolverines need-
ed him again, though, Morgan
responded. With the deficit down
to three points late in the game,
he blocked JerShon Cobb's layup,
hit his own shot on the other end,
finished an alley-oop and then
stunted Michael Thompson's
3-point attempt with a powerful
hedge off a screen.
"Tonight he was just feeling
it," freshman forward Jon Hor-
ford said.
"He was doing great, no matter
where you threw him the ball. He
was just taking his time, pivoting,
getting open buckets ... He defi-
nitely earned his points."
Beilein cautioned that the
young big man has plenty more
developing to do. Still, for one
night, Jordan Morgan had his
moment.

Former Wolverine
forward led team
to first-ever
College Cup berth
By BRIAN MECHANICK
Daily Sports Writer
Two months ago, the Michi-
gan men's soccer team reached
its greatest heights and the
future looked bright. Today,
one decision has shaken the
team to its core.
Soony Saad, the Wolverines'
star freshman forward, left the
University after the fall term in
pursuit of a professional career
in Europe.
Michigan coach Steve Burns,
who has led the program since
its inception in 2000, saw
Saad set record numbers never
before seen in Ann Arbor, lest
by a freshman.
His first public response to
his star player leaving was short
and sweet.
"Soony feels that now is the
right time for him to pursue
his lifelong dream of playing
professionally overseas," Burns
said. "We wish him the best in
all of his future endeavors."
Burns has said he will not
comment on Saad's departure
again, per team policy. But the
messageis clear.
When Saad did not show
interest in going to the MLS
after the season, Burns, the
Michigan Ultras and many
followers of college soccer
assumed Saad would be back
for a sophomore campaign.

Early rankings had Michigan
among the favorites to push for
the NCAA title.
Saad's departure has thrown
that all into flux. Along with
senior forward Justin Meram's
move to the MLS's Columbus
Crew, the Wolverines -are now
without ,36 of their 53 goals
from last season.
Michigan is in the hunt for
strikers, but with none listed in
the incoming freshman class,
sophomores-to-be Ezekiel Har-
ris and Malcolm Miller will
have to step up.
For Burns, Europe has
become a poacher of his talents.
Not only is Saad being looked
at by clubs in Germany and
Belgium, but top 2011 signee
Sean Cunningham, a left back,
passed over the Wolverines for
Norwegian side Molde FK.
Saad enters the pro rank try-
ing to beat a miserable Michi-
gan soccer alumni tradition.
Before 2011, six players had
been drafted into MLS, with
none achieving regular starting
jobs.
Perhaps the most sobering
example for Saad is that of for-
ward Peri Marosevic. Drafted
No. 5 overall by FC Dallas
in 2009, Marosevic has only
played four times in league play
for Dallas.
Saad is undoubtedly a hot
commodity among some of
Europe's elite clubs.
He may be the first national
star to come out of Burns's pro-
gram or he could go the way his
Wolverine predecessors. Either
way, his Michigan teammates
and club supporters will miss
No. 8up top next fall.

There's a difference between communicating ideas and experiencing them. It's the
difference between memorizing a foreign language and thinking in one. Between
studying ruins and excavating them. Between analyzing dreams and living them. The
difference is huge. And it's the very essence of the University of Chicago Summer
Session. Where students are engaged at every level-intellectually, socially, personally,
and professionally. Where you can benefit from the value of taking university courses
in an accelerated, intensive format. Join us this summer for an extraordinary learning

'M' beats Wildcats, picks up fifth conference win

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Editor
Junior guard Stu Douglass
made his first start of the season
in the Michigan men's basketball
team's 75-66 win over Northwest-
ern last night at Crisler Arena.
Part of the reason Douglass
started was to help the Wolver-
ines (5-7 Big
Ten, 15-10 NU 66
overall) MICHIGAN 75
get off to a
faster start, but part of Beilein's
decision to start Douglass over
freshman Evan Smotrycz was
a defensive move - an effort to
slow the production of North-
western's hot hand, junior John
Shurna, who exploited Smotrycz
and the Michigan defense the
first time these two teams face
off, scoring 22 first-half points.
But Shurna didn't start on
Wednesday. And it was North-
western coach Bill Carmody who
should've made a defensive move
for his team in order to slow down
redshirt freshman Jordan Mor-
gan, who manhandled the Wild-
cat defense last night for his best
game of the season.
He matched his Big Ten season
high of 17 points in the first half
alone, and continued his scoring

campaign in the second stanza,
finishingwith 27 points.
Fueled by Morgan's monster
first half, the Wolverines went
into halftime leading 34-19. But
even with the 15-point cushion,
junior captain Zack Novak felt
his team was too loose heading
into the second half. Last year's
matchup with Northwestern -
when the Wildcats overcame a
17-point halftime deficit to beat
Michigan in Ann Arbor - seemed
all too close in his memory.
"I just told everybody we need
to come out and take their heads
off right off the bat," Novak said
Wednesday. "The way North-
western plays, they can get back
in games quick. They can get out
of games quick and they can get
back in games quick, so it defi-
nitely wasn't over."
Just as Novak predicted,
Northwestern (4-8, 14-9) came
out strong in the second half.
Senior Michael Thompson scored
the first seven points of the peri-
od, which pulled the Wildcats
within eight. But it was in the
final five minutes of the game
when the Wolverines became the
most vulnerable.
On the coattails of fourstraight
3-point scoring possessions, the
Wildcats clawed their way back

to within one point of Michigan.
"You can't lie" Douglass said.
"There (were) thoughts that the
whole success we've had for 38
minutes (was) just going to be
gone, but we kept fighting."
Because of Morgan's produc-
tion in the post, the Wolverines
had to rely less on their outside
shooting and attempted a season-
low 15 3-pointers. And their 21
shots from the charity stripe is
the team's best in conference play.
Beyond Morgan's impressive
performance, freshman guard
Tim Hardaway Jr. notched his
first-career double-double with
17 points and 10 rebounds. Sopho-
more point guard Darius Mor-
ris rounded out the double-digit
scoring with11.
With the victory over North-
western, Michigan has amassed
15 wins so far this season - the
same number of victories last
year's squad accumulated the
entire season. And with the Wol-
verines playing arguably their
best basketball of the year, it's
hard to look past the postsea-
son chatter. That's especially the
case when Michigan closes out

Reading the leaves of
Ann Arbor's tea culture.
By Erin Steele,A

As many college students will attest,
coffee has become the number one
way to power through long weeks
of homework and studying. But what hap-
pens when they've grown tired of the daily
latte? Perhaps it's time for coffee addicts
to embrace their adventurous sides and
explore the endless varieties of a less com-
monly consumed drink: tea.
Steeped in tradition
When visiting TeaHaus on N. Fourth
Ave., it's impossible to ignore a sign nearthe
door that reads, "Only the best .5% of the
annual world tea harvest is of high enough
quality to be considered for our collection at
TeaHaus."
Opening the door and walking inside,
customers are greeted by the sound of clas-
sical music and the aroma of the store's 180
varieties of black, green, white, oolong,
rooibos, fruit, herbal and ayurvedic teas.
Neatly stacked silver tea tins cover one wall,
while the other side displays teacups, pots,
strainers and other tea paraphernalia that
only experts would recognize. In the adja-
cent tea room, there is a wall covered in
books accompanied by a sign: "Learn fur-
ther about tea!"
There is certainly a lot to learn.
"Tea is justas complex - if not more com-
plex - than wine. The topography of where
it's grown, the seasonal and climatic chang-
es - everything plays a big part in what your
end cup will taste like," explained TeaHaus
owner Lisa McDonald.
"We're not fancy," was McDonald's first
reply when asked what she would sayto the
average University student who might be
mystified or intimidated by tea culture.
"We're actually just really casual people,"
she said. "Two of the people who work here
are students at U of M. We're not gonna diss
you because all you've ever had is Teavana."
For McDonald, the most important char-
acteristic of the tea house is its emphasis on
taking things slow. She feels that because
Americans are always in such a hurry, the
closest people will come to taking a minute
to slow down is when enjoyingtea.
"I think there's something about tea that
kind of makes you sit down for a minute,"
she said. "We sell a lot of tea to go, but there
is something to be said about (having) to
wait two minutes for a cup of tea to brew, so
there's two minutes of your life you have to
be willing to give up to enjoy a cup of tea."

When TeaHaus first opened, McDon-
aId refused to put in Wi-Fi Internet access.
After a while, she gave in to popular
demand, but she still turns off the Wi-Fi on
Saturdays.
McDonald's fascination with tea began
on a backpacking trip through, Europe,
which turned into a 14-year stay, during
which she worked as a business consultant.
"I did a lot of traveling for business,"
McDonald said. "Every village that I went
to had an apothecary-style tea store with
up to 300 types of tea, and so it just became
what I would do - I would go into these
towns and look for the tea store."
McDonald began taking courses to
become a tea sommelier - someone with
training and extensive knowledge of tea as
a hobby. In the process, she became some-
what of a tea expert.
"One of the things that is a surprise to
most people is that Germany is the world's
largest tea purchasing country and also has
the strictest quality control," McDonald
said. "They have a zero tolerance for pesti-
cides and heavy metals."
After moving to Ann Arbor, McDonald
began looking for a career that would allow
her to raise her two young sons. She opened
TeaHaus in December 2007 with about 200
different loose teas, all imported from Ger-
many.
McDonald is quick to point out that what
most Americans think of as the typical tea
house is much more refined than the vast
majority of the traditional ones throughout
Europe.
"In the U.S., most of the tea rooms have
a lot of doilies, flowers, a lot of pink, alot of
mauve," she explained. "Most of the really
fancy tea rooms in Europe are for the tour-
ists. Most of the tea rooms I went to were
just like what we would call a cafd - they
just happened to sell tea instead of coffee. It
just happened to be ina building that is 250
years old, so it kind of oozed a little quaint-
ness, but not on purpose."
In keeping with this statement, the actu-
al tea room of TeaHaus, which opened in
September, is more consistent with the tra-
ditional European tea house."
"We don't have the big hats and the white
gloves and the doilies and stuff like that,
because in 14 years of living in Europe, I
never once saw that," McDonald said.

FOOD WARS
Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a battlefield
as Daily Arts staffers butt heads over which restaurant makes it best.
California Roll


Dear Christina Aguilera,

What about us?

JED MOCH/Daily

TOTORO
215 South State
Totoro's California roll doesn't just
consist of rice and seafood - the res-
taurant has succeeded in rolling plenti-
ful amounts of awesomeness in its most
delectable sushi creation as well. With
its delicate crab meat, its light, crunchy
cucumber slices and all those sesame
seeds sprinkled on top, there's no doubt
that this is a roll that would make the
Golden State proud.
SUSHI.COM
715 North University
Sometimes it's all about the little extras.
At $3.69, the California roll comes in eight
pieces with orange smelt roe slathered
on top. If you're seated on the right-hand
side, you might be able to see one of the
sushi specialists preparing it. At the end
of the meal, your check comes with a
sucker. Because, while those little extras
are important, you did justspend less than
four dollars for your meal.

SADAKO
1321 South University
With Sadako's California roll, you'll
first be struck by some silky-smooth avo-
cado, followed by a refreshing morsel of
crab meat and finally the crispy-crunch
of thinly shredded cucumber. After you've
completed that foodgasm, you might
notice a few gummy grains of rice strag-
gling on the roof of your mouth - but
when it comes to quality sushi, that's the
least important ingredient.
AYAKA
1205 South University
No contest. Ayaka has the best Cali-
fornia rolls in town. With the perfect
crab-to-cucumber-to-avocado ratio, this
concoction melts in your mouth on the
first bite. And, if you like, the right amount
of soy sauce and wasabi makes this maki
roll truly a wonder. But the sushi's own
merits (i.e. no added accoutrements) are
enough to leave you full and satisfied. Plus,
the restaurant's got great mood lighting.

Latinis not dead yet at'U
Students in the classics department and
RC program use culture to revive Latin
By Lucy Perkins I Daily Arts Writer -

Sailor's delight

Latin has held a steadfast pres-
ence far beyond the reaches of
memory - no technology, war or
revolution could wipe it off the
map. Many would argue it to be a
dead language, its culture no lon-
ger existent or applicable to life
today. But anyone who has dipped
a toe into the classics scene at the
University would strongly dis-
agree.
"There has never been a peri-
od - ever - where the language
has not been spoken," said LSA
Prof. Gina Soter, who founded the
Residential College's department.
"It may not have been a first lan-
guage, but the language has a his-
tory from antiquity through the
Middle Ages - through every-
thing - up until the current day."
Within the RC, students and
faculty have created a cozy atmo-
sphere in their own department
that brings Latin to life through
cultural activities outside the
classroom.
Soter founded the Residential
College's Intensive Latin program
when she joined the University in
2000. She discovered that teach-
ing students to speak the language
(as opposed to just reading and
writing) almost instantaneously
improved their understanding of
Latin. Before Soter came to the
University, Latin existed solely in
LSA, and there, speaking wasn't a
priority. The RC program contin-
ues to challenge that.
"We finally added our fifth
semester readings class, which is
a class that culminates in a Latin
play done in Latin," Soter said.
This 300-level class is limited
to students who have taken Latin
195 and 295 and then passed a
Latin proficiency test. The play

selected this year was written by
Plautus in 200 B.C., and students
designed the costumes and the
set, besides acting in the produc-
tion.
"We work with the play and
figure out how we can make
something that was written two
thousand years ago accessible to
people today and keep it in Latin,"
Soter said.
"The problem for many stu-
dents and people is thatthey don't
have any idea what kind of life the
Latin language has had outside of
classroom authors," she added.
Every two years, Soter orga-
nizes a trip to the Vatican in Italy,
during which students in the RC
Latin program have a chance to
communicate with a monsignor
- a native who only speaks Latin.
It is this type of experience that
Soter hopes will help get the lan-
guage off the page and alive inthe
minds of students.
The RC's classical department
is part of a larger group of just
over 150 students who are work-
ing toward classical majors and
minors under the close instruc-
tion of 29 faculty members, with
classes that often have fewer
than ten students. Many of these
students may not have originally
planned to be a part of this small
department when they enrolled at
the University - students in the
field come from concentrations
like classical archaeology and
modern Greek.
According to Soter, many of her
students didn't expect to study
Latin. Some intend to pursue
careers in medicine, law or educa-
tion, but others simply had no idea
what they wanted to study.
"I've had some of the most

SALAM RIDA/Daily

LSA Prof. Gina Soter founded the RC Latin program in 2000.

wonderful students come in with
no clue why they want to do it,"
Soter said. "I think it's because
they wanted to do something dif-
ferent."
This was the case for Chris
Ostro, a 'U' alum who triple
majored in history, comparative
literature and classical language
and literature.
"I didn't expect to go into clas-
sics as a freshman," Ostro said,
"but I thought Latin would be
the hipster language to learn, so
I took it as my language require-
ment and I really liked it."
After reading the Latin poet
Catullus, he was hooked.
"I couldn't believe how relat-
able it was - it was weird that
there was a difference of a two
thousand year period, but I total-
ly got this guy," Ostro said. "It's
insane, I wish I had been intro-
duced to Latin when I was young-
er."
Ostro is now in grad school
with the intent of becoming a late-
ancient historian. But he didn't
get to where he is now without
running into skepticism about
Latihalongthe way.
"It's really weird to be in a field
where you spend half of your time
defending its existence - there's
no other field that is so heavily
scrutinized," Ostro noted.
Ostro hypothesized that con-
tinuous scrutiny and skepticism
form one of the reasons the Clas-
sics department is so strong and
close-knit.
"U of M's department is so
great because you have the older
professors who come from the old
guard of academia - pre-World
War II guys - and then you also
have a lot of younger classics pro-
fessors too," he said.

Though they may come from
completely different places, Latin
professors at the University can
be characterized by dedication.
"Everyone in the classics pro-
gram is wholeheartedly dedicat-
ed to what they're doing, which
gives it an unusual feel," he said.
"It's something that really means
a lot to them, they've sacrificed a
lot and they're giving everything
they can to this field. It creates a
really nice community - every-
one's really supportive."
LSA senior Erich Heiden, who
is majoring in Latin language
and literature and minoring in
European history, was first intro-
duced to classical culture in a high
school Greek mythology class. He
set a goal for himself - to read
Homer in the ancient language -
and decided to pursue itin college.
After taking Greek 101, profes-
sors within the department sug-
gested that Heiden should take
Latin too. Now he plans to become
a Latin high school teacher.
"It's great because it's close-
knit," Heiden said of the program.
"It's cool going to our own library.
and only seeing familiar faces."
The Classics department's
library is open only to students
concentrating in the program,
located on the second floor of
Angell Hall.
The feeling of closeness within
the Latin-learning community
extends outside the classroom as
well.
Heiden is the president, or
"Prytanis," of the honors fraterni-
ty Eta Sigma Phi, which provides
opportunities for students and
faculty to mingle when they're not
in class. Facing dwindling mem-
bership in recent years, Heiden

staples from around the county
make it a worthy competitor of
its many maritime-located peers.
In its 2004 "100 Special Issue,"
Saveur Magazine named Mona-
han's one of its top markets.
Moreover, Monahan's friendly
and knowledgeable staff will
guide any wayward seafarer or
shy neophyte in the right direc-
tion. Their suggestions put me
right on course for one of the
best lunches I've had in Ann
Arbor.
Steppingup to the turquoise-
colored lunch counter, you'll be
greeted warmly by one of the
market's fishmongers and a mas-'
sive hanging swordfish. That and
a large buoy ball hanging from
a black net are just a few of the
touches that add to the wharf-
like ambiance of the eatery. The
service was no-fuss. We ordered
at the counter and sat down.
Within ten minutes the food was
ready and brought to our table -
no tip expected.
The space is more market-like
than a formal restaurant, mean-
ing seating options are sparse.
The counter has a couple of high
chairs, but perhaps more cozy
are the square-shaped tables
with seating for two around the
corner. They are covered with
white paper, crayons available if
you love to doodle while you wait
to down a delish meal.

On the menu are the main-
stays: mussels steamed in white
wine and garlic sauce, fried cala-
marl and fish and chip, as tel
as some more daringecombina-
lions fordhose who aren't afraid
of fishiness. I have a roommate
who cringes every time she sees
any form of marine life. Perhaps
Cajun shrimp salad, bluefish teri-
yaki and hand-shucked oysters
aren't for everyone.
However, if you're not a wimp
about fish, the bestipart of the
menu - hands down - is the
option to "pick a fresh fish." The
staff shows you to a large glass
display case stuffed with the
day's selections. The fish avail-
able vary by season. Price is
based on the market value.
Choose from an array of
sauces to cook yours in - tartar,
grenobloise (caper sauce, for
non-French speakers), remou-
lade (another tartar-like sauce
usually flavored with curry
powder or pickles), teriyaki,
mustard-mayo, mustard-dill-
mayo, aioli, sweet and spicy Thai
and San Remo butter (sun-dried
tomatoes, white wine, basil and
chives). I mixed the Spanish
mackerel our serversuggested
with this last sun-dried sauce.
My friend chose the Atlantic
salmon burger, served on a bun
with red onion, lettuce, tomato
and a dill sauce. She added avo-
cado to it. The salmon was sur-
prisingly succulent - at $6.95, it
was a steal for its freshness. And
they only charged her 45 cents
for the avocado extra.

The mackerel was the greatest

A portion of hand-cut Cajun

whenever you want them.
Monahan's is atrue delight.
It's worth a brisk walk from

are sure to brighten your day.

D . ' THE CONVERSATION' (1974), PARAMOUNT
Coppola's secret masterpiece


By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Arts Writer
Francis Ford Coppola is a
prominent member of the New
Hollywood elite, best known for
his coup de grace, the "Godfather"
trilogy. However, an extensive
body of work that includes "Rum-
ble Fish," "Apocalypse Now" and
the acquisition of a Napa Valley
winery hides an overlooked gem:
"The Conversation." This 1970s
thriller features a twist ending
that puts M. Night Shyamalan's
two-bit ruses to shame and con-
fronts us with moral dilemmas
that would make Dr. Franken-
stein soil himself in shock.
Harry Caul (Gene Hackman,
"The French Connection") is one
of the most respected surveil-
lance experts in the business, and
he reaps tidy sums by selling his
talents as a quasi-private inves-
tigator. In service to the high-
est bidder, he exposes dishonest
business relationships, political
pitfalls and cheating spouses.
But when he suspects a client of
plotting a murderous crime of
passion, he's forced to reevaluate
his job, his lifestyle and his entire
code of ethics.
Coppola conveys the precari-
ous morality of Caul's job in sever-
al ways. In terms of the narrative,
Caul's paranoia cripples his abil-
ity to nurture any social life. His
colleagues and lover know noth-
ing about him, and he hates being
questioned about anything for

fear thathe's being taped. And his la's genius is in his ability to excite

the Nixon administration used
during the Watergate scandal.
According to Coppola, the fact
that the film was released only
six months after the scandal went
public bore no political implica-
tions, since filming ended well
before the White House's indis-
cretions. Coincidence or not, it'd
be hard to find the same degree
of authenticity in other spy flicks.
But even in light of the cor-
relation between Coppola and
Watergate, the theme of surveil-
lance is far more important now
than it was in the '70s. Maybe a
bit of sermonizing is warrant-
ed, at least in retrospect. For
example, the U.K. operates one
camera for every 14 citizens, and
a third party study in 2002 esti-
mated that the citizens of the
sovereign state are subject to the
watchful lenses of approximately
4,200,000 cameras. Similar cam-
era trials have long been debated
as a form of crime prevention in
the U.S. in light of the U.K. pro-
gram's success.
In "The Conversation," the
tables are turned on Caul when
he discovers that his own meth-
ods are being used to monitor
his apartment. It's been nearly
40 years since the film's release,
and spy equipment is more tech-
nologically advanced than ever.
It's enough to make you wonder
whether our impression of securi-
ty may be a double-edged sword.

TEA
From Page 1B
The tea room is a place where
many professors and graduate
students come to work. It also
holds tea tastings and semi-
nars, as well as baby and brid-
al showers. Though TeaHaus
doesn't serve traditional meals,
it provides a light menu of treats
from all over the world, includ-
ing scones and truffles actually
infused with tea.
"It's there so people can enjoy
a little food with their tea as
opposed to get some tea with
their food," McDonald said of
the menu. Her aim is to keep the
focus of her business on the teas,
which she has made sure are the
best of the best.
While the store certainly has
a solid constituent of loyal cus-
tomers, employees are more than
happy to teach novices about the
wonders of tea.
"We really like to look at our-
selves as a place to come and not
just drink a cup of tea, but get
informed," McDonald said. "We
spend a good 20 minutes with
new customers just explaining
to them some of the myths about
tea. You basically walk out with a
bag of tea and a mini-lesson."
The love of tea shared by
McDonald and her staff pervades
the entire nature of their busi-
ness, and they want customers to
feel the same way.
"We just enjoy that people are
curious," she said. "(We want)
to let the guys know that it's not
a 'frou-frou girl thing' - it's a
pretty cool beverage. One of the
guys who worked here and just
left was a track and field star at U
of M. It's far more accessible than
people might think we are."
A holistic hippie home
TeaHaus isn't the only estab-
lishment dedicated to provid-
ing quality teas in Ann Arbor.
Crazy Wisdom Bookstore and
Tea Room also takes its teas quite
seriously.
Originally just a bookstore
co-owned by husband and wife
Bill Zirinsky and Ruth Schekter,
Crazy Wisdom opened its tea
room in 1999 as a community-
oriented establishment.
"(Crazy Wisdom is) a place for
the community to come in and
have something to eat and drink,"
Crazy Wisdom manager Jerri
Dodge said.
Its cozy, warmly lit atmo-
sphere lends itself to the cultural
events that take place there sev-
eral times throughout the week,
including concerts, poetry read-
ings and club meetings. The
shelves are lined with count-
less books on everything from
alternative spiritual practices
to holistic health, and there are
meditation rooms on the second
floor. It's a place where one could

easily grab a book, settle down
in a nice, cushiony chair by the
window and spend an afternoon
enjoying a good cup of tea in an
atmosphere that is a little more
laid-back than the sophisticated
surroundings of TeHaus.
Dodge said the aim of Crazy
Wisdom is to accommodate as
many customers as possible,
whether they be community
members or University students
and faculty. She said it is essen-
tial for the staff to be able to
teach customers about different
types of tea.
"First, Itwill ask someone how
familiar they are with tea - how
often they drink it, and if they
drink it often, what kind. The
most common answer I've had to
that is Lipton," she said.
She lets customers experience
the different aromas, and decide
whether they like single leaf or
blends. Though their blended
teas do not feature much flavor-
ing, quite a few are made with
real berries or flower petals.
"One specific tea that has
been a tea room staple is a Victo-
rian Earl Grey with lavender and
rosemary," Dodge said. "It's one
of our biggest sellers."
Other popular teas feature
dried raspberries, strawberries
and rhubarb, as well as more
vegetal flavors. Although a drink
made with flower petals may
sound odd to many, Crazy Wis-
dom attempts to make things
easy with its vast variety of teas
and accommodating nature of
the staff.
Crazy Wisdom's food menu is
more extensive than TeaHaus's
and features bakery items like
cupcakes and macaroons as well
as international dishes. It serves
around 125 black, green, rooibos,
white, oolong, herbal blend and
single herb teas as well as cof-
fee. Some of these teas are single
estate, meaning that they come
from a single area of land (as
opposed to the common blend of
leaves from different geographi-
cal areas).
The criteria for selecting these
teas are very high. Dodge takes
great care in choosing which teas
will round out Crazy Wisdom's
menu. She generally buys from
about four different tea compa-
nies and one herb company -
she is currently in the process of
searching for a new company to
buy from after one of the estab-
lishment's regulars went out of
business.
In selecting a tea company,
Dodge carefully reads the menu,
sources all the information about
the company and then asks for
samples for the staff and owners
to test from the companies that
seem good. She is also careful to
research the history of the estate
the tea is coming from. So far, she
has investigated eight companies
and received 'samples from three
- none of them have made the

But for Dodge, the appeal of
the Crazy Wisdom really comes
down to the environment.
"The community orientation
of the owners and Crazy Wisdom
staff makes it one of the most
comfortable businesses I have
worked at," she said.
Great balls of boba
For a tea experience that is
even more accessible and fun,
look no further than Ann Arbor's
bubble tea shops. Very differ-
ent from a European-inspired
tea room, bubble tea shops like
Momo Tea and Bubble Island
embody tea's fun, playful side,
with their Asian tea recipes that
feature tapioca "bubbles," also
known as "boba." Boba consist
of tapioca roots cut into circles
and cooked in water with sugar.
The end result is a slimy, marble-
sized bubble that can be sipped
through a straw.
Momo Tea supervisor Mary
Emma Young, an LSA junior,
has worked at the store since its
opening about a year and a half
ago.
"Bubble tea is really popular in
far-east Asia and southeast Asia,"
Young explained. "For Taiwan
in particular, it's gourmet and
traditional - the way we drink
mochas and lattes here is kind
of how they drink bubble tea,
but it's geared toward younger
people a little bit more, given the
color and the novelty."
Though bubble tea is relatively
foreign to the Midwest, the large
population of international stu-
dents in Ann Arbor has created
an advantageous market for plac-
es like Momo Tea.
"I've had a lot of Taiwan-
ese customers come in and tell
me that they feel like they just
walked into Taipei, which is real-
ly great to hear," Young said.
All of Momo's tea is brewed
and blended by hand in the store
under the close direction of man-
ager and Taiwan native Angie
Thai. The menu is seemingly end-
less, with huge amounts of flavors
including green and milk teas.
"There's lots of flavors inspired
by fruits that grow in that area in
the world," Young said. "In Tai-
wan, mangos are like apples in
Michigan, so mango is a really
popular flavor."
There are also some less popu-
lar features in Momo's tea, which
Young said might seem odd to
American taste buds.
"In East Asia, red beans and
green beans are used to sweeten
things. It's a basic feature in des-
sert, kind of the way chocolate is
here. I brought a burrito into a
shift for dinner and to (my man-
ager) that was like a hamburger
with chocolate on it."
Young recognizes the creation
of bubble tea as an art, due to the
meticulous training period each
employee must undergo to make
teas that meet the store's high

LATIN
From Page 3B
made it his goal to improve
recruitment and revitalize the
program's social life.
Latin Scrabble, Jeopardy
and translating exercises are
a few activities the group does
at weekly meetings. Larger
events include a traditional
Roman feast, which was held
in December.
"It was at my house and
each of the students were
each responsible for part of
the meal," said Robin Axelrod,
the Classics department's pro-
gram coordinator.
Students found the recipes
for each dish in an ancient
Roman cookbook.
"The banquet was a really
cool way to experience the
ancient culture, the classical
way of life," Heiden said.
Events like this give the
department character and
allow faculty and students to
get to know one another.
"It's a great combination of
class and experiences because
you have this mix of students
who would never meet each
other otherwise and they end
up forming these incredible
bonds," Soter said.
According to Heiden, profes-
sors know their students well
in the LSA Classics depart-
ment. In contrast to other
LSA lectures, courses within
the Classics department have
no more than 20 students - a
characteristic that lends itself
to one-on-one contactbetween
students and professors.
"It's such a small depart-
ment, so if you're talking with
a professor about your inter-
ests, they'll suggest other
faculty you should interface
with," said Malcolm MacLach-
lan, an LSA junior majoring in
classical language and litera-
ture. "You never have trouble
getting recommendations -
there's an entirely different
mindset to it."
It's this mindset that con-
tinues to breathe life into the
Latin language and distin-
guishes the program from oth-
ers. Soter noted that although
the language has remained
static over the years, its value
has never diminished.
"I don't think you can say
(Latin is) artificially con-
structed or used, because
people have spoken in this
language and written it con-
stantly," she said. "Christo-
pher Columbus's discovery of
the New World was written in
this language."
Within the University of
Michigan, Latin isn't bound
to the page. It's alive in games,
feasts, plays and travels. And
most importantly, it's alive in
the minds of young students.

standards.
"I really appreciate my man-
ager's drive to produce a really
authentic and high quality prod-
uct, and I'm really inspired by
how she wants to convey her cul-
ture," she said.
Unlike at a traditional tea
house, bubble tea drinkers have
more control over exactly how
they want their tea to taste.
"You can really make your
own beverage here," Young said.
"We really give our customers a
lot of freedom to make choices
for themselves. It can be over-
whelming."
Fortunately, employees are
happy to make suggestions, and
they give out alot of samples.
Young said the shop is a great
place for students to stop in and
get some work done, which many
people do between classes and on
the weekends. While the store
features brightly colored orange
and green walls and Asian chil-
dren's toys and stuffed animals,
there is also a bookshelf stacked

with literature, newspapers and
even board games.
Slurping up some slimy bub-
bles along with tea may not sound
appealing to some, butYoung has
some good reasons for people to
give ita try.
"I think everybody should try
something at least once," Young
said. "You don't have to get bub-
bles in anything. But if they're
willing to try it, they will prob-
ably love it... it's definitely unique
and it's a lot of fun."
When it comes to tea, Ann
Arbor has all degrees. Whether
a sophisticated, European expe-
rience, a hippie-esque feel, or a
tea shop that looks like it's been
imported directly from Asia, tea
drinkers are bound to find some-
thing new. And in walking in to
try it, they'll not only get a nice
cup of tea, but an education as
well.
