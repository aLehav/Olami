More morning,
Friday classes
to be scheduled


New plan will save
* the University
about $462 million
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
When Martha Pollack, the
University's vice provost for
academic and budgetary affairs,
told her son - a freshman at the
University - that the Univer-
sity's plan to restructure class
scheduling would likely result in
more early morning and Friday
classes, he groaned in response,
she said.
The plan to restructure the
class scheduling process was
initially announced at a meet-
ing of the Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs,
the University's leading faculty
governance body, meeting on
Jan. 9. Its goal is to reduce the
over-scheduling of classes dur-
ing peak hours - 10 a.m., 11 a.m.
and 1 p.m. - Monday through
Thursday by raising the number
of classes during non-peak hours
and on Fridays.
With implementation of the
new plan, the Office of the Regis-

trar will be able schedule classes
in available rooms after depart-
ments with priority have select-
ed their rooms - until5 p.m.
instead of noon.
In an interview last Thursday,
Pollack said she was concerned
that students may not be recep-
tive to the changes. Still, she said
she is excited about the plan, and
is confident students will recog-
nize that the advantages - like
fewer scheduling conflicts - are
worth the sacrifices or waking
up earlier or having Friday class.
"If we can spread out the
classes more, then it's actually
easier for students," she said.
Pollack also said the change
will allow for better utilization
of campus buildings and prevent
tuition increases by saving the
University about $462 million.
As more academic buildings,
like the Dennison Building, are
repurposed into office spaces,
the University would have had
to erect new buildings to com-
pensate for the loss of classroom
space until the policy was imple-
mented. The University will also
reclaim $18 million per year in
electricity costs from the repur-
posing of the buildings.

Flash mob fun

One campus group aims to
alleviate the immense pressure
placed on students by the stress-
es of classes and extracurricular
activities through the power of
laughter.
Founded this year by LSA
sophomore Miranda Kahn, Cam-
pus Chaos organizes impromptu
comedic events across campus.
The initial idea for the group was
spurred from flash mob YouTube
videos created by Improv Every-
where, a New York acting compa-
ny, Kahn said.
Both groups are based on the
idea of initiating seemingly ran-
dom, yet previously organized,
commotion in public . spaces.
Kahn said elements of surprise

and entertainment are the main
focuses of the campus club, and
the group enjoys keeping students
guessing.
"(Our goal) is creating happi-
ness and joy in different and unex-
pected places," Kahn said.
In the future, Campus Chaos
hopes to create interactive spec-
tacles such as recreating scenes
from "Ghostbusters" in the Sha-
piro Undergraduate Library and
holding a human petting zoo on
the Diag, Kahn said.
"We hope the events will be
a fun and engaging time for stu-
dents, and promote happiness
throughout campus," Kahn said.
She added that the club is
open to students of all abilities

and experience, not just theater
majors or improvisational actors. Â°
Even professors can participate,
Kahn said.,
LSA sophomore Jami Levin has
been working to advertise the new
club across campus with flyers,
social media and digital advertise-
ments, and said she's has attracted
about 300 students thus far.
The group's uniqueness comes -
from its base in fun and light-
heartedness, not academics or
goals for the future, Levin said. n -;
"It's fun to be doing something
that's not for your resume and just
do it so you meet new people and
just have fun and laugh and brain-#
storm," Levin said. PAUL SHERMAN/Daily

ASSEMBLY
From Page 1A
son said the tuition equality reso-
lution was met with t-epidation
by the Assembly, but he expects it
to pass when it is voted on at the
Assembly meeting next week. The
goal of tuition equality is to allow
undocumented students who
have lived the majority of their
lives in Michigan to be considered
as in-state students and exempt
them from the higher out-of-state
tuition.
Designating Michigan resi-
dents who are undocumented
as in-state students could have
positive economic benefits for

the state of Michigan because the
University could produce more
alumni who live and work in the
state, Watson said.
"(The) benefits go way beyond
just the students," he said.
Watson said he supports both
the tuition equality and medical
amnesty proposals due to their
positive impact on the student
body, adding that the medical
amnesty program encourages
students to make smart decisions.
"(Medical Amnesty) is some-
thing that has the potential to
impact the entire student popula-
tion," Watson said. "... If it saves
one student's life, I think it's
worthwhile"
In addition to proposals about


800.ZRoview 1800-273-84391 PrinoetonReview.comn
- -U . l? <r *":"; ets

medical amnesty and tuition
equality, a resolution was pro-
posed in support of organiza-
tions - including Amnesty
International and the American
Civil Liberties Union - who are
opposed to the National Defense
Authorization Act, which
includes a provision allowing U.S.
citizens to be detained for undis-
closed amounts of time if they are
thought to be involved with ter-
rorism.,
The Assembly will vote on the
resolutions at next week's meet-
ing, and if passed, they will be
sent to legislators and other polit-
ical leaders.
LSA sophomore Omar Hashwi,
a CSG representative and co-
author of the resolution against
NDAA, said the proposed policy
"puts every American citizen in
jeopardy."
He added that it's unneces-
sary to combat terrorism by
compromising individual free-
doms.
' LSA sophomore Rayan El-
Zein, a CSG representative and
the other co-author of the reso-
lution, said the NDAA would
"preserve the status quo of the
Patriot Act."
The meeting was sparsely
attended, with only 26 of the 44
Assembly members at the open-
ing roll call, and 25 at the closing
roll call. The number needed for
a quorum is 22 members.
Business senior Matt Eral, the
Assembly's speaker of the house,
said the turnout was "average to
below average."
In his address to the Assem-
bly, Eral said low attendance
at meetings and a lack of avail-
ability to constituents led to the
creation of the Representative
Outreach Task Force - a group
that will be especially active
this semester to improve stu-
dent-representative relations.
He added that he expects to
develop individual websites for
representatives with visible vot-
ing records, and will potentially
require representatives to hold
office hours.
Members of the Central Stu-
dent Judiciary also attended the
meeting to discuss complaints
received after the CSG recall
elections in November.

ter learn how to manage the fire
department's budget amid the
city's economic difficulties.
The city made cuts in vari-
ous areas in the last fiscal year,
including reductions to the bud-
gets of the AAFD and the Ann
Arbor Police Department that
led to layoffs and reductions in
personnel .
Before making cuts this year,
Briere said the city aims to seek
the guidance of professional
advisers.
"It was not about cutting fire
department budget," Briere said.
"It's about knowing enough to
make good decisions."
Data discrepancies within the
report have caused some coun-
cil members to express concern,
according to Briere. The report
was initially released in Decem-
ber, but was further revised
and redrafted before being re-
released this month.
"The firefighters were con-
cerned that the data used in the
review was not current," Briere
said. "Data collected, includ-
ing the number of firefighters
on staff, has changed over the
period of the report due to the
city cuts."
Briere added that response
time data may also be inac-
curate because of the way it

was recorded, noting specifi-
cally that it's unclear whether
the tests measured the time
between when the truck leaves
the station and arrives at the
location, or when the call comes
in and the truck reaches its des-
tination.
City Council member Tony
Derezinski (D-Ward 2) agreed
with Briere, and said the incon-
gruities in collecting infor-
mation may have skewed the
report, or show inaccurate data.
"We believe there may be
some discrepancy between how
the city calibrated response
times and how they were mea-
sured by ICMA," Derezinski
said. "We are going to have a
work session where we review
these statistics thoroughly."
AAFD Chief Chuck Hubbard
wrote in an e-mail interview
that the report still needs to be
evaluated by the fire department
and City Council.
"There is a need for detailed
clarification on the response
time data," Hubbard wrote.
"Accuracy will be determined
after a thorough evaluation of
the contents."
The report recommends that
the AAFD consider purchasing
quick response vehicles for bet-
ter efficiency in emergency situ-
ations. These mid-sized vehicles,
generally the size of a large pick-
up truck, can be equipped with a
compressed air foam system and

an alternative fire extinguisher.
The report suggests these vehi- 0
cles be used in fire stations 3 and
4, located on Jackson Avenue
and Huron Parkway, which typi-
cally respond to more EMS calls
than fires.
"These QRVs may be these
more reasonably sized vehicles
for the typical EMS response,"
Derezinski said. "We are defi-
nitely reviewing a cost-benefit
analysis on the use of these vehi-
cles."
The vehicles will cut costs and
reduce staff due to their small-
er size, the report states. The
city will ultimately determine
whether or not to utilize the
vehicles, but before any changes
can be made, the city would first
have to renegotiate its collec-
tive bargaining agreement with
the firefighter union in order to
address a three-person mini-
mum personnel requirement for
all fire suppression vehicles.
The report also proposed
changing some responsibili-
ties - these include training
to identify fire hazards, more
fire suppression training, using
computer programs to solve
problems by using the technol-
ogy to display trends - of the
firefighters, incorporating addi-
tional planning techniques and
strategy software while offering
additional methods for training
and monitoring of department
performance.

A snowshoer who was lost in

he stayed alive by digging out a

paper money for warmth.
Yong Chun Kim, 66, of Taco-

that he had fire starters with him
and first burned some leaves.
Then he started burning person-
al items: his socks and then $1
and $5 bills from his wallet.
Kim, who served in the South

War, told the station that skills
he learned as a soldier helped
him survive.
Kim also said he marched in

his backing.
Speaking at a town hall yes-
terday in West Columbia, S.C.,
Gingrich was asked whether he
could support a Muslim-Ameri-

The former House speaker

Christmas day

* bomber escapes
after gun battle
The suspected mastermind
of the Christmas Day bombing
of a Catholic church in Nige-
ria escaped custody after being
arrested in the country's capi-
tal, police acknowledged yes-
terday - an embarrassment for
a nation struggling to contain
increasingly bloody sectar-
ian attacks by a radical Islamist
sect.
Authorities said Kabiru Soko-
to planned the bombing that
killed 38 people at St. Theresa
Catholic Church in Madalla, just
outside Nigeria's capital Abuja.
But his arrest at the mansion of
a state governor in Abuja, and
subsequent escape, raised more
questions about the govern-
ment's ability to stop the radi-
cal sect, known as Boko Haram,
which claimed responsibility for
the church attack.
Federal police spokesman
Olusola Amore said in state-
ment that a local commissioner
ordered Sokoto transferred to
another police station in Abaji,
just outside of Abuja and that the
policemen escorting him were
attacked by suspected sect gang
O members who freed him.

JONESIN' FOR A JOB

WIKIPEDIA
From Page 1
Wikipedia is joined by other
websites, including Wordpress
and Reddit, that disconnected
their services today out of soli-
darity or displayed their public
disapproval like Google, which is
displaying a black banner over its
logo today.
MacKie-Mason added that
students worried about the Wiki-
pedia outage should remember
there are other sources of infor-
mation on the Internet.
"It may be hard for today's stu-
dents to remember, but all of us
had to find information without
Wikipedia not very long ago."
Engineering freshman Brad
Olson, who had previously heard
about the planned blackout, said

he would be disappointed there
were barriers limiting his use of
Wikipedia.
"If that were to go down ... I
would probably be pretty upset,"
Olson said. "It would feel like I
lost a resource."
However, some students said
they aren't concerned about
the repercussions of not being
able to use Wikipedia for a day,
mostly because they do not have
any immediate schoolwork that
requires online research.
Engineering sophomore Jer-
emy Ross said most students are
able to use other resources on the
Internet to gather information.
"It might make researching
something more difficult," Ross
said. "But you can find almost
all of the information, I would
assume, that's on Wikipedia on

Verma added that he believes
advances in technology and
increased public awareness on
the issue will help reduce the use
of animals in research and the
pursuit of unnecessary research.
University of California, Los
Angeles neuroscientist David
Jentsch, a member of the board
of directors of Americans for
Medical Progress, said some
of the current technology that
replaced animal research over
the past 30 years would not be
possible without discoveries
made through animal research.
"Cell cultures, computational
models - the things you hear
people talk about that are alter-
natives to animal research in
every case - emerged because
scientists discovered in the
course of a study a more tech-
nologically sophisticated way of
doing the study," Jentsch said.
Jentsch, who noted that his
car was once blown up by animal
activists, added that it doesn't
make sense for activists to target
only animal researchers, but also
institutions like fast food chains.
"If animal activists were
honest, they are against animal
research and (they) are against
you because you eat Burger
King," Jentsch said. "(If this
were true,) then they would have
no support."
LSA freshman Jasmine
Garmo said she supports animal
research as long as ethical guide-
lines and animal welfare laws are
observed.
"I am all for animal rights, but
I also believe that the recent reg-
ulations set in place have made
animal research safer and not
as detrimental for the animals
involved," Garmo said.
Engineering freshman Aditya
Chintalapati said as long as the
testing is done in humane ways,
it should not be an issue.
"However, I don't think it's
going to be necessary in the
future," Chintalapati said. "In
the future, technology will
become more sophisticated and
most of testing will be done by
computers."

SCHEDULED
From Page 1
Pollack added that she was
glad that the savings could
help curb recent rises in tuition
without harming the quality of
instruction at the University.
"We're dealing in a time of
very constrained resources, so
if we do things like move classes
around and, as a result of that,
still have lower tuition increases
or still have raises for faculty and
staff and have these other ben-
efits - less conflicts for students,
more use of the nice classrooms
- it's kind of a win-win," she
said.
Amid rising tuition and an
increase in operating costs for
the University, Pollack said she
has been examining all pos-
sible methods of saving costs.
Through repurposing of campus
buildings, she said the plan will
slow the rush of construction
that has persisted over the last
decade, noting the University
grew in square feet at more than
2 percent per year from 2001 to
2007.
According to data compiled by
Frances Mueller, assistant vice
provost for academic and bud-
getary affairs, about half of class-
rooms are empty at 8 a.m. and 5
p.m. during the week.
Conversely, classes are often
overscheduled during peak
hours and professors have dif-
ficulty finding open classrooms,
according to Pollack. She iden-
tified three or four classes in
the School of Nursing for which
professors were unable to sched-
ule classes in the same room for
every meeting.
"A lot of faculty think, 'Wow,
we must have a real shortage of
classrooms because I can never
get my class schedule,"' Pollack
said. "Well, actually that's not
true. We have this oversupply,
but the problem is everybody
wants to teach their class at the
same time."
The plan hopes to resolve the
time conflicts by scheduling no
more than 35 percent of all class-
es during peak hours, no fewer
than 35 percent of classes during
off-peak hours - 9 a.m., noon, 3
p.m. and 4 p.m.- and 15 percent
of classes on Fridays, according
to Pollack.
Currently 39 percent of class-
es are held during peak hours,
about 32 percent are during non-
peak hours and 12 percent are on

Fridays.
Kim Kearfott, SACUA vice
chair and a professor in the
Medical School and College of
Engineering, said at last week's
meeting that the over-schedul-
ing problem offered few flawless
solutions, but the rise in the per-
centage of early morning classes
may inconvenience students.
"The young adult mind of a
freshman or sophomore doesn't
work well early," she said at the
meeting.
LSA junior Lars Johnson
said the proposal's potential to
decrease scheduling conflicts
may be particularly beneficial
to underclassmen who are still
determining their majors and
enrolling in courses in multiple
departments.
Overall, Johnson called the
plan "reasonable" because it
checks tuition increases and
aims to prevent scheduling
conflicts for students and pro-
fessors. He said he wouldn't be
more inclined to skip class if it
were earlier, but added that he
thought other students may be
prone to do so until they grew
used to the changes.
"It's tough to get people who
are attentive in class at that time,
and until an actual culture gets
behind it, I'll bet they get a lot of
people who just skip class," he
said.
LSA junior Ray Stapleton said
he would likely skip early lec-
tures, since it's something he
does frequently already.
"I don't like having early
classes," he said. "It sucks when
there's a class I want to schedule
and I see it's at 8:30."
LSA junior Rebecca Lynn, an
employee at the University Hos-
pital, said she works early in the
morning and therefore would
not mind earlier classes since
she would already be awake.
She added that she believes
the plan is fair and sensible,
particularly since she has had
difficulty scheduling Psychol-
ogy classes to fit her major in
the past because the required
courses are often taught at the
same time, forcing her to choose
between classes.
"The tradeoff is definitely
worth it," she said. "If it means
lowering tuition, it's not a huge
commitment. It's not like they're
asking for Saturday or Sunday
classes."

Sustain STEM programs
Math and science majors should be promoted
Any student who's taken a math or science class at the Univer-
sity has grappled with the demands of a rigorous academic
schedule. The burden is taking a toll as an increasing num-
ber of students who enter college with the intention of majoring in
a STEM - science, technology, engineering and math - discipline
decide to switch majors. As the United States continues to lag in math
and science education, it's important that the University continue to
foster a supportive environment for students studying these subjects.

Student warning! Do your homework early.
Wikipedia protesting bad law on Wednesday!"
- Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales tweeted Monday about the Wikipedia blackout today
in protest of two anti-piracy bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP. Act.
The catch-22 ofpolitics

According to a study cited by a Nov. 4 arti-
cle in the New York Times, about 40 percent
of students who plan on majoring in engi-
neering or science switch concentrations or
fail to receive a degree. When pre-medical
students are taken into account, this number
rises to roughly 60 percent.
It's encouraging that the Obama admin-
istration has made math and science educa-
tion a priority. The topic was mentioned in
the State of the Union address last January,
and last June the president called on univer-
sities to produce 10,000 more engineers each
year. As the U.S. navigates a more competi-
tive global economy, an emphasis on math
and science is essential to creating a healthy
climate for technological innovation.
More students sticking to the pre-medical
track could mean better progress toward
reducing the projected deficit of 91,500 phy-

sicians by 2020, according to the Associa-
tion of American Medical Colleges.w Action
is better than rhetoric - Obama should set
forward substantive policy initiatives that
directly address shortcomings in college-
level math and science education.
The University should also address the
issue. As a first step, tracking the number
of students who switch majors would help
determine the scope of the problem. Steps to
combat attrition could include redesigning
lower-level coursework, modifying grading
procedures to ease freshmen into math and
science learning and expanding tutoring
resources available on campus. Though both
the University and the federal government
are aware of the issue, it must become a focus
as the need for students with math and sci-
ence backgrounds continues to grow.

U pon hiring Washington
D.C.'s first chancellor of
schools, then-mayor Adrian
Fenty was asked
by his new-
est employee,
Michelle Rhee,
"How much are
you willing to
risk?"
"Everything,"
Fenty responded.
And that he did. SARAH
Fenty, who ROHAN
spoke in Blau
Auditorium at
the Ross School of Business on Mon-
day as part of the 26th annual Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Sym-
posium, focused the majority of
his speech - as he did his mayoral
tenure - on education reform. The
issue of education reform is perhaps
foreign to students here in the eru-
dite halls of the University, but the
problemofafailingAmerican school
system is real and widespread.
Take, for example, the statistics
of Fenty's own Washington, D.C.
school district. At the time of his
inauguration in 2007, reading pro-
ficiency among eighth graders was
12 percent. The rate was even lower
in math, with students showing an
8 percent proficiency. Washington,
D.C.'s scores echoed hundreds of
other schools systems across Ameri-
ca, but Fenty - as mayor of a district
with the worst scores in the nation
- was unwilling to perpetuate the
pitiful statistics.
Fenty looked to the radically dif-
ferent school models New York City
Mayor Michael Bloomberg and for-
mer Chicago Mayor Richard Daley
employed in their own cities. Fenty
felt that the best way to reform D.C.'s
schools was to run them "like a pri-
vate sector business" as Bloomberg

and Daley had done. Consequently,
Fenty transferred control of D.C.
school systems from an elected
school board to himself. In the final
steps of transformation in 2007,
Fenty hired Michelle Rhee, an
inexperienced but determined for-
mer teacher, as the school district's
chancellor.
Throughout Rhee's tenure as
chancellor, she closed 23 schools
and fired 266 "bad" teachers. Rhee
introduced the notion Fenty refers
to as "accountability" or the system
of "rewarding good teachers and
punishing bad teachers." While pub-
lic school teachers in D.C. received
salary increases based on senior-
ity, Rhee wanted to reward teachers
with salary increases based on the
quality of their instruction, rather
than the length of their career.
It was a bold move and didn't go
unchallenged.
In the span of four years, profi-
ciency of D.C.'s 8th grade students
rose to 15 percent in both areas of
reading and math. According to
Fenty, the improvements in this
short period were greater than any
recorded improvement in the pre-
ceding 30 years.
Despite the greatest educational
turn-around in D.C. history, Fenty
was not re-elected for a second term.
The most unsettling fact about his
failed bid for re-election is that the
majority of those who voted against
him were African Americans, or
those who would be the primary
beneficiaries of an improved public
school system.
In trying - and succeeding - to
make a radical change, Fenty ended
his mayoral candidacy. The idea
that marked change risks political
backlash is not a new or unknown
concept. Consider President Barack
Obama, who won the 2008 presi-

dential election largely through
promises of great change but is now
often criticized for being too pas-
sive. As frustrating as it may be, can
we really blame him? We live in an
era where the payoff of employing
actual change comes at the expense
of a political career. Fenty's situa-
tion underscores the great catch-22
of politics - people make a career of
politics to bring about change, but
once they are put in a position to do
just that, they will shy away from
anything too drastic so as not to lose
Change comes at
the expense
of a career.
their career.
As sad as this reality is today,
Fenty pointed out that it may not be
the reality of tomorrow. Appropri-
ately, Fenty quoted from King's "I've
Been to The Mountaintop" speech
wherein he recalled, "only when
it is dark enough, can you see the
stars." To also borrow from MLK's
final speech, I believe that we have
"seen the promised land" in both
education reform and more broad-
ly, political willingness to employ
change thanks to Fenty's efforts.
The positive changes that happened
in Washington D.C. during Fenty's
short tenure as mayor can happen in
any arena where change is needed.
Our politicians just need to practice
a little more "dangerous unselfish-
ness," as King would say.

al lure to follow through
Maroun needs to allow proper repairs on bridge
Matthew Maroun, the owner of the Ambassador Bridge
that connects Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, has defraud-
ed Michigan taxpayers by failing to follow construction
orders from the state. Maroun and his company should meet the
obligations set out for them or continue to face legal action.

In2009,theMichigan DepartmentofTrans-
portation filed a lawsuitcagainst Maroun's com-
pany for not completing its part of the Gateway
project. The project, which has been in devel-
opment since the 1990s, would reduce traffic
around the Ambassador Bridge by implement-
ing a series of new ramps that connect to local
freeways. Instead of completing the project as
planned, Maroun diverted bridge traffic past
a duty-free gas station and convenience store
that he also owns. Maroun was held in con-
tempt of court in November and was jailed last
week for his failure to finish work on the Gate-
way project, as ordered by court.
Many of the nation's aging bridges are struc-
turally deficient and need to be upgraded in

order to meet modern demands. In this case,
the state is in a unique position to renovate its
infrastructure by sharing costs with the Cana-
dian government to improve a critical crossing
between Detroit and Ontario.
Because of Maroun's actions, improvements
to the current bridge, as well as construction
on a proposed second bridge, are now in jeop-
ardy. His mismanagement of resources hurts
the people of Michigan by wasting tax dollars
and delaying important improvements to a
crossing that Michigan's manufacturing and
tourism industries can't operate without.
Maroun should face jail time until the
Department of Transportation is satisfied with
his company's work on the Gateway project.

LAURA ARGINTAR fIE
In defense of Dell

Every time I find a seat and unpack my
belongings - namely my laptop - in the
Hatcher Graduate Library Reference Room, I
can't help but notice that I have the only Dell
in a sea of Macs. I don't have a lit up apple to
proudly display as I'm hard at work. My com-
puter is significantly less sleek and I can never
don a cool case that fits my larger, heavier PC.
It suddenly feels - for a split second - that
I am in high school again. The odd man out
whose mother packs her a hearty roast beef
sandwich while the rest of the lunchroom
sneers with their delicate cheese on white
bread. In almost every meeting, every class-
room, every table, my Dell is the only thing
that separates me from the rest of the group.
Growing up with a "techie" father who
endorsed only PCs - so much so that when I
was 10 years old he had me take apart a com-
puter and put it back together again - I have
never grown accustomed to Apple products.
You'll never see me with an iPhone or Pad or
MacBook, and I'll never understand how to
even open Safari, let alone use it. My life as
a student revolves around a dark navy blue,
basic yet durable laptop that sometimes gets
viruses and other times shuts down unex-
A

pectedly and forgets to save.
More often than not, I am constantly ques-
tioned about my brand choice. "It's weird you
don't have a Mac," or "CanI borrow your char-
ger?" that I clearly don't have. But at the end of
the day, I've been with my same Dell for four
years, and I know it better than I know the
University campus. I don't stress about keep-
ing up with the constantly updated Apple mer-
chandise, I don't need all the fancy software
like Final Cut or Photoshop. It's almost as if my
world is a little simpler when it's just me and
my Dell - and that's okay by me.
Throughout our four years at college, we
embark on a journey to better understand our-
selves. A big part of going to school is trying out
classes and clubs that may seem foreign to you
at first, but eventually, as you gain an interest in
the subject, you realize that the club you joined
is made up of people with the same interests
as your own. In some ways, we all start out as
outsiders, yet ultimately find our niche. And
maybe, if I'm lucky, these people will also have
a Dell that I can share my charger with.
Laura Argintar is an LSA senior
and a Daily opinion blogger.

This is the time of year when
we used to watch documen-
taries about the civil rights
movement of the
1960s in elemen-
tary and middle
school. Class
was set aside
for assemblies
where an actor
read the Rev. Dr.
Martin LutherS
KingJr.'s "I Have SETH
a Dream" speech SODERBORG
and the gospel
choir sang out
in faithful strains. These were the
only moments when the school cur-
riculum acknowledged that religious
communities were at the center of
the civil rights struggle.
The moviesshowed us an inspiring
story of progress. Whether the move-
ments began in Montgomery, Ala. in
1954, or in Little Rock, Ark. in 1957,
they marched us from one southern
city to the next until we arrived with
hundreds of thousands of people in
Washington, D.C. to watch King tell
us of his dream in 1963.
My teachers liked to say that the
"Dream" speech was made up on the
spot. Lastyear, I heard arecordingof
King's speech to a crowd in Detroit,
two months before the March on
Washington D.C.. He reminded
listeners that "injustice anywhere
is a threat to justice everywhere,"
and then rebuked satisfied North-
ern sympathizers, "No community
in this country can boast of clean
hands in the area of brotherhood,"
King said.
King came to Detroit - and
marched with labor leaders like
Walter Reuther of the United Auto
Workers - to protest the "subtle
and hidden" discrimination African-
Americans faced in the North, where
racialized realty practices and dis-

criminatory hiring segregated the
public schools.
"I have a dream this afternoon,"
King said, "that one.day right here in
Detroit, Negroes will be able to buy a
house or rent a house anywhere their
money will carry them, and they will
be able to get a job."
We've all seen videos of Bull
Connor's cops beating marchers.
Every civil rights documentary
shows peaceful protesters forced
to the ground by white men with
water cannons.
Most of us haven't seen images of
whites rioting during a 1966 march
for fair housingin Chicago. King was
hit on the head by a thrown brick,
and told reporters, "I think the peo-
ple from Mississippi ought to come to
Chicago to learn how to hate."
The public school curriculum
left out Northern civil rights battles
completely. Perhaps that's because
what King and others were fighting
against - realtors' subtle ways of
keeping non-white homebuyers out
of certain neighborhoods - rarely
produced shocking images like
those caught during the Southern
marches.
There is an easy way to tell the
story. Documentarians already have
a story are in the boycotts and march-
es of the 1950s and early 1960s, from
Rosa Parks to the "Dream" speech.
It's an arc full of pathos, replete
with images that challenge viewers
to understand how America has not
always lived up to its ideals.
By ending with the March on
Washington, or with the signing of
the great civil rights laws, the story of
the civil rights movement becomes a
closed narrative of triumph. African
Americans suffered. Then - led by
King - they overcame.
That narrative is incomplete. In
the years after the March on Wash-
ington, King fought with other great

whelming majority.
If you visited a school in Detroit
today, you would see that de facto
segregation continues to deny
children the opportunities they
deserve. Walking down the city's
empty streets, you would see that
one of King's dreams - that one
day Detroiters could get jobs, never
came to pass.
Teaching the struggle for racial
equality as something that happened
long ago in the South sends a mis-
leading message. This narrative tells
us that the American community has
alreadyovercome discriminationand
its legacies. It teaches Northerners to
look down on Southerners for their
intolerance, leaving us blind to the
inequalities that continue to shape
our own communities. We should
be honest with ourselves and teach
the whole story, so that someday, we
might overcome.

That struggle never really came to
an end. After California adopted a
law - now part of the federal code
- that made it illegal to refuse to

rose up in protest. A year after the

its melodies
and its gim-
micks. Best of all, I've memo-
rized its silences - the pauses
between tracks, the tiny, pre-
chorus gaps in "High 5 (Rock
the Catskills)," and the fading,
vinyl crackle that opens "Where
It's At." Odelay has achieved,
through dedication, a burly
fusion with my consciousness.
Yet the one silence I can never
quite forecast - the moment that
keeps Odelay's guillotine-grip
on my head - comes with the
last track. After four minutes
of "Ramshackle" (which would
have been an apt title for the
album) and its doomy, casual
beauty, the track remains silent.
After about two minutes, what
sounds like a cyborg dry-heaving
eviscerates the afterglow, looping
for a minute before ending the
album.
I vividly recall the first time
I heard it. I had put on Odelay
as a late-night, bedside accom-
paniment in high school. I had
fallen asleep within the first few
tracks. And in the middle of some
dream - which quickly became
a nightmare- the sound forced
me awake, staring into darkness,
terrified at nothing.
Ah, those hidden tracks. It's a
terrific trick.
One of the most prominent
early (though not the first)
instances of this trick is credited
to The Beatles - with a sinister
bit of looped babble concluding
the first UK pressings of Sgt. Pep-
per's, in what is called a "locked
groove." In a locked groove, the
vinyl is cut in a closed spiral so
that the needle constantly resets.
Your record can play until the
end of time, your needle erodes
or the power goes out.
Countless artists, from ABBA
to Weird Al, have done more than
simply put looped noises at the
end of their works. Full songs
found their way onto the tail ends
of albums' and singles' pregnant
pauses. Different pressings and
remasters have produced end-

less variables, with different
tracks, slight differences in speed
and runningtimes, occasion-
ally (or outrageously) stripping
the albums of them entirely. It's
become the lovely minutiae of
obsessive record collectors in
some tragically dazzlingballet
of distribution, obsolescence and
capitalism.
I've come to love hidden tracks
because they horrify me. I picked
up an old CD pressing (Discogs.
com lists 71 total versions) of
Nirvana's Nevermind last sum-
mer and was delighted to find
the final song, "Something In the
Way," listed with a hidden track.
I listened to the whole album on
a mid-day drive from Detroit to
Ann Arbor, waiting the entire
12, conclusive minutes to hear it.
I was treated to the cryptically,
wonderfully titled "Endless,
Nameless," which, Cobain was
furious to find, wasn't actually
included on Geffen's initial press-
ings of the album.
Be vewy, vewy
quiet, we're
hunting hidden
twacks.
The track itself, a shrieking
sludge-bomb with Dave Grohl's
attempt at instilling orderby
whaling on every cymbal in
reach, didn'tgratify me as much
as the silence leading up to it. For
12 minutes, I gripped my steer-,
ing wheel. For 12 minutes, I tried
to predict it. For 12 minutes, I
waited.
Silence can be uncomfortable
for many people. And if you're
John Cage, it can be the basis of
an entire philosophy. To me, hid-
den tracks and locked grooves
are explorations of what silence
can do for you.
Hidden tracks are a chance
for me to willingly submit myself
into the tension of my own
expectations - in which any
sound, every sound, becomes
its own little cataclysm. Every
moment can be the last. I have
to ponder fate. And in locked
grooves, I can appreciate silence
and what it might mean to be
free. I've come to realize the ideal
of silence only exists in my head.
Traffic, crickets, my own heart-
beat - there's only one way to
escape that.

in the mines. In order to han-
dle the harsh conditions, the
workers, coming from diverse
backgrounds and languages,
developed Gumboot dance as a
means of communication and
amusement.
Williams created Step Afri-
ka to develop a relationship
between stepping in America
and the dance forms of South
Africa. This not only established
an innovative dance form, but
also explored the connections
between movement and culture
between the two continents.
The upcoming performance
will feature South African Gum-
boot dance as well as Zulu dance
technique, a form derived from
the Zulu tribe designed to cele-
brate certain rituals. Throughout
the show, a traditional African
drum ensemble will mix their
rhythms with the beats the danc-
ers create.
"One piece is called 'Tribute,'
and this is our way of paying
homage to the African-American
step show and all different styles
of stepping," Williams said.
In addition toto the traditional

stepping of South Africa, more
interpretive pieces will be inter-
spersed into the show, covering
the history of a wide variety of
styles.
Throughout the performance,
dancers start and stop at sepa-
rate times, creating a continu-
ous piece. The music becomes
more powerful as a larger group
of dancers perform the same
rhythm at the same moment.
It then transitions into softer,
divergent tones as they break
away from the group and per-
form their own songs, provid-
ing a contrasted, complicated
dimension to the performance.
The show will also incorpo-
rate slam poetry, using voice as
another component of the per-
formance. Moreover, Step Afrika
encourages constant communi-
cation with audience members to
let thembecome part of the danc-
ers' songs.
Like a Morse code message,
the Step Afrika dancers will
clap, stomp, yell and, of course,
step to the beat of the drums,
speaking their own language to
the audience.

Still 'Rock' solid in sixth season

By SAM CENZHANG
Daily Arts Writer
"30 Rock" has always been
the most unhinged of NBC's
Thursday-night block. At its
best, the show
veers toward
the cartoonish, *'**

ing farce with premiere
abandon. After
a weak season Thursdays
four, "30 Rock" atll p.m.
recovered last NBC
season, devel-
oping its voice
while still maintaining the
laugh-a-minute, frenetic energy
that makes it so great. The sea-
son six premiere continues along
the same lines.
Everything "30 Rock" does
well is on full display in the pre-
miere. Appropriately enough for
a show about a show, "30 Rock"
has always been on-point yet
over-the-top hilarious when it
takes on current television forms
and tropes. Last season's high-
concept parody of Bravo shows
was funny, but most of its jokes
were too specific to the language
and form of that particular sub-
genre. Season six's first episode
returns to the low-hanging fruit
of reality television, and its take
on competition shows hits the
mark. Jenna (Jane Krakowski)

is brilliant as the Simon Cowell
character, telling characters to
jump back up their mothers and
demanding multiple takes to get
the best shot of crying children.
The reality-show-within-
the-show is tonally perfect. The
kids singing are vaguely creepy,
and John McEnroe's effusive
delivery of lines like "this will
just make us better friends" is
strangely convincing, consid-
ering his former life as a com-
bustible tennis star. "JO Rock"
is always great at coming upT
with titles, ("The Rural Juror";
"Werewolf Bar Mitzvah") -and
it strikes again with "America's
Kidz Got Singing."

some of her work, as well the mind becomes an essential

tool used to escape any conun-

By understanding the mind of
a writer, we can be better read-
ers. Scott expressed that writ-
ing is never an easy task. There
are always concerns, which she
tries to address in her pieces.
She emphasized that fiction is
a mode for experimenting with
language, in which she plays
with the arrangements of words
and the power of representation.
Reading and writing go hand-
in-hand and, as a result, one's
passions as a reader often flow
into one's writing.
"With each book there have
been certain pleasures that I
can never repeat," Scott said.
"Some took me to places where
I had to travel to do research,
some introduced me to areas of
knowledge that I was ignorant
of, some were personally sat-
isfying like the kind of expres-
sions, the play of language that I
allowed myself."
Scott's writing has become
more than just a career. Rather,
she becomes so immersed in her
work that she transforms into a
character herself and sees the
place she is imagining and the
culture she is envisioning.
"I like to go to the places that I
write about," Scott said.

"clown in a leg lock" between
his thighs - and the frenzied

the episode, the vodkagods must

Stonum dismissed from Michigan football team

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Senior wide receiver, Darryl
Stonum has been dismissed from
the Michigan football team for a
violation of team rules, accord-
ing to a statement released by the
Michigan Athletic Department
on Tuesday afternoon.
Stonum was redshirted during
the 2011 season after a second-
offense arrest in May for driving
while visually impaired - the
first offense came in Septem-
ber 2009 - and was expected to
return for a fifth-year senior sea-
son in the fall. But Stonum was
jailed two weeks ago after violat-
ing his probation by driving on a
suspended license and received
a 10-day jail sentence. Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke made the.
decision that Stonum would not
return for the 2012 season.
"I love Darryl and wish him
nothing but the absolute best,"
Hoke said in the release. "How-
ever, there is a responsibility and
a higher standard you must be
accountable to as a University of
Michigan football student-ath-
lete. That does not and will not
change.
"It's unfortunate because I
believe he has grown a great
deal as a person since the begin-
ning of the season. My hope is
that maturing process contin-
ues."
In three seasons, Stonum
started 25 games, catching 76
passes for 1,008 yards and six
touchdowns. He also saw time
on kick and punt returns, setting
the program's single-season kick-

with Stonum's work ethic and
attitude all fall.
"He's embraced what hap-
pened to him and has learned
from it," said senior tight end and
team captain Kevin Koger. "A lot
of guys might get suspended and
then they'd just transfer. But he
stuck it out.
"When he's been through
everything he's been through,
and all the turmoil and all the
speculation, I'm just glad he
stayed."
Stonum's classmate and best
friend, fifth-year senior wide
receiver Junior Hemingway, was
the star of the Sugar Bowl, catch-
ing a pair of memorable touch-
down passes to win MVP honors.
They had spent four years
together, and Stonum missed out
on their last season together. It
was bittersweet.
"It just motivates me for next
year," Stonum said, watching his
teammates celebrate.
"They're going to see a beast."
No longer.
Michigan's team plane touched
down the next day, Jan. 4. Later
that day, Stonum wrote, "Guess
who's back!" on Twitter. Some-
one asked if he'd be playing the
next season. Stonum replied,
"Y'all answer this for him."
The next morning, Stonum
drove to meet with his probation
officer. He was pulled over on a
suspended license and arrested
for violating probation.
It was the last straw for Hoke,
who witnessed Stonum charged
with driving while visibly
impaired and stopped twice for
driving on a suspended license.

season.
"I appreciate everything the

Stonum said in the release. "I
look forward to continuing my
football career down the road,
but more importantly, right now
I'm focused on graduating from
Michigan this Spring. I under-

come around, Stonum would be
ushered indoors and out of sight.

New Orleans, being part of every-

as his teammates.
Stonum was the first one to

Moffie's defense drives
Wolverines on offense

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
After Friday night's victory
against Ohio State, Michigan
coach Red Berenson and fifth-
year senior goaltender Shawn
Hunwick happily answered the
questions about the shutout win.
But while they were busy gush-
ing, another Michigan player was
patiently waiting to be addressed
by the media.
It was junior defenseman Lee
Moffie, who had a standout game
against the Buckeyes, second only
to Hunwick. He provided the
Wolverines' first goal of the night
and an assist, but until that night,
he had never been the center of
defensive focus.
It's easy to get caught up on
the team's traditional defense-
men. Senior Greg Pateryn is a big,
fearless guy who isn't afraid to
slam opponents into the boards to
go after the puck - everything a
defenseman should be.
Those players are undoubt-
edly valuable to the team, but hey
can't compare to Moffie if you
look at the box score.
Moffie quietlyleads the teamin
plus/minus rating (plus-20) and
assists (17). You wouldn't know it
without looking at the stats, but
there's something about his pres-
ence on the ice that catalyzes the
team's offensive drive.
"Moffie can free up a forward
with one good pass," said Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson. "He can
jump in and join the rush. He's
got good offensive instincts, (and)
that's the kind of player that we
recruited."
Just as Berenson likes his for-
wards to play both ways, he val-
ues the same versatility in his
defense. But Moffie's offensive
intuition doesn't show in number
of goals scored. Instead, he takes
pride in surveying the environ-
ment and setting up his team-
mates for goals.
Moffie makes sure driving
the offense doesn't become his
top priority - he learned that
lesson before he ever arrived at
Michigan, when he played for the
Waterloo Black Hawks. No mat-
ter how good his offense was, if
his defense wasn't up to par, he
wasn't going play that game.
"My main focus is always play-
ing good defense," Moffie said.
"Like coach said, good defense
generally leads to good offense.
My main focus is always to play
good 'D,' and that's the way it

Junior defenseman Lee Moffie leads the team in plus/minus and assists.

works out."
Moffie's strength on defense
comes from the fact that he can
easily move the puck out of his
own zone and is alert to his sur-
roundings. Once the puck gets
in front of the opponent's net, he
doesn't have trouble setting up his
teammates with assists.
He doesn't think there's any
special formula for the number of
assists he's tallied over the course
of the season - for him, finding
an open man is a matter of luck,
not skill. But Berenson sees it as a
hybrid of the two.
"It's a little bit of coincidence
and a little bit of confidence,"
Berenson said. "He's got offen-
sive instincts that you can't teach.
He might see a play that another
player doesn't. It's good execution
and good awareness."
Even though Moffie doesn't
play with the same. ferocious
nature that Pateryn does, he still
finds his own balance between
necessary aggression and making
smart decisions.
"It's not like (Moffie is) soft out
there," said freshman defense-
man Mike Chiasson. "He plays
tough when the time comes.
Moffie does a good job of know-
ing when to step up, when to play
tough and when to knock guys
down in front of the net. He finds
a good balance."
For most of the first half of the
season, Moffie skated with Chias-

son. But since the return of sopho-
more defenseman Jon Merrill,
Berenson has found a productive
combination.
"They're both smart with the
puck, both smart without the
puck," Berenson said. "I think
they'll be an imposing pair. They
can move the puck, they can cre-
ate offense, and they'll be solid."
Moffie in particular has noticed
a difference in his game since he
started playing with Merrill.
"We're growingtogether, game
by game, practice by practice,"
Moffie said. "We work off each
other, (and) we're looking to get
the immediate play."
It seems paradoxical that
someone who leads the team in
plus/minus rating and assists only
has three goals to his name so far
this year, especially after Moffie
led the defensive corps in goals
last season.
Moffie hinted that the dis-
crepancy might have something
to do with Michigan's lackluster
power-play unit, which is where
the bulk of his scoring came from
last year.
But it doesn't matter to Beren-
son or the team how often Mof-
fie's shots find the back of the net
- playing solid defense remains
the top priority.
"(Moffie) is a really humble
person," Chiasson said. "Just
keeping the game simple, he's just
doing his job."

Douglass also played wellinhis
first start since the season opener
against Ferris State, always seemv
ingto deliver when his team need-
ed it most. He started in place of
struggling sophomore forward
Evan Smotrycz, who had shot a
miserable 2-of-19 from the field
over the previous three contests.
In the waning moments of the
first half, as Michigan State nearly
erased a 10-point deficit on a 9-0
run, Douglass nailed a 3-pointer,
getting fouled hard by a Spartan
defender. He went to the free-
throw line and completed the

four-point play to kill Michigan
State's momentum and help the
Wolverines take a 36-29 lead into
the locker room at halftime.
The play evoked images of
Novak's four-point play from
last season at the Breslin Center
in East Lansing. Michigan State
opened that contest with a 6-0
run, but Novak neutralized the
momentum on a 3-pointer from
the corner, while being fouled.
"If you don't want that last-
second shot, I don't know what
you're doing playing basketball,"
Douglass said.
Michigan had to overcome.a
couple of major disadvantages to
come out of this one with a vic-
tory. The Wolverines finished
just 6-for-21 from behind the arc
(28.6 percent), largely due to the
recent shooting woes of Hard-
away Jr. and Smotrycz, who were

combined 0-for-6 on the day. The
pair combined for a woeful 0-for-
12 from long range in Saturday's
game at Iowa as well.
Compare that to the Spartans,
who shot an efficient 7-for-15 from
downtown on clutch shooting.
"We did enough things to win
the game, we did enough things
to lose the game," said Michigan
State coach Tom Izzo. "But when
you do enough things to lose the
game, you're not going to win
them on the road, especially in
your rival's backyard."
The Spartans also did solid
work cleaning up the glass, out-
rebounding the Wolverines, 31-18,
and only allowing two offensive
boards from Michigan. But Mich-
igan coach John Beilein insists.
that that was part of the game
plan.
"We're not going to rebound

great in that game," he said. "We
sent three people back on every
possession - we weren't trying
to get offensive rebounds. ... We
were trying to take away their
transition game, so there's sort of
a method to our madness."
Ultimately, players agree that
one of the biggest advantages
Michigan had was the crowd at
the Crisler Center, which at times
was the loudest it's been this sea-
son. In all likelihood, it was the
loudest home crowd Burke has
ever played in front of
"The Maize Rage was great for
us, and they kept us energized
down the stretch," Burke said
with a smile on his face. "It feels
great, just to be able to give Zack
and Stu this win, them playing
against Michigan State their last
time here. That was the greatest
feeling."

Burke proves mettle in win

nu knowa player is truly
elite, is truly something
special, when he deserves
a nickname.
We're in an era that is, com-
pared to the
past, simply
embarrassing.
when it comes
to dishing out
nicknames.
Maybe our
generation ofY
sportswriters
just isn't cre- BEN
ative enough. ESTES
Maybe play-
ers are now
so reserved when dealing with
the media that they don't present
a persona to the press that leads
itself to an easy nickname.
In any case, these days, it's
pretty standard to just take
someone's full name and A-Rod
or D-Mo it. (I refuse to legitimize
the nickname "Butterfly" that
some tried to force on former
Michigan point guard Darius
Morris.) I bring this up because,
after the way he played in Michi-
gan's 60-59 win over Michigan
State on Tuesday night, Trey
Burke officially needs a nick-
name.
I vote for "Trey the Truth,"
though I worry that rapper Trae
Tha Truth isn't popular enough
for it to catch on widely. But
there's plenty of time to figure
out abetter one later on, since
it's clear that the freshman point
guard is going to be terrorizing
defenses - whether in the Big
Ten or in the NBA--for many
years to come. After leading all
scorers with 20 points and key-
ing the Wolverines to a huge win
over the Spartans - their third
straight in the in-state series,
proving that the rivalry is, once
again, a real rivalry - there's no
doubt left that Burke is the team's
best player.
Michigan coach John Beilein
(as well as the media) was reti-
cent for most of the season to go
too far in anointing Burke. After
all, despite earning the title of
Ohio's Mr. Basketball his senior
year of high school, Burke was
just an ordinary three-star
recruit, maybe a four-star to
some scouting services.

Burke really arrived at the
Maui Invitational, immediately
asserting himself in Michigan's
first game against Memphis.
Playing in such a big-time
atmosphere against so many
teams, the Columbus native
was unfazed. He even seemed
to thrive in the limelight. That
should have been the first clue
as to Burke's true potential -
the great ones live for the big
moments and rise to them, using
those times to lift theminselves to
heights they couldn't otherwise
reach.
"I just felt like I had to make
big plays," Burke said after the
Michigan State game. "Coach
Beilein told me one of my jobs
was to make big plays tonight,
to get the team what we want
every time down on offense.... I
can't say I was the best player out
there. There were just times out
there I had to make a big play for
my team."
Maybe Burke can't say that
he was the best player out there,
but I'll say it for him. And those
big moments are the reason why.
All night he was responsible for
the most important momentum
plays for Michigan. There was
his and-one layup, followed by
his trap of Michigan State guard
Travis Trice, which forced Trice
to burn a timeout with 9:34 left
in the first half. The Spartans cut
into the Wolverines' lead later in
the frame, and Burke responded
by stealing the ball in the back-
court and scoring over Draymond
Green. His play gave Michigan its
first double-digit lead of the night,
and it was the loudest Crisler Cen-
ter has been in my two years cov-
ering the team (though not as loud
as when the final horn sounded.)
Burke saved his best for when
the Wolverines needed it the
most, scoring when Michigan
State stole the lead and the
momentum, and when he was
no doubt the most tired. With
Michigan down three points
with 5:29 left in the game, Burke
calmly launched a 3-pointer from
NBA range to tie it back up. A
minute later, down four points,
he attacked the rim and hita foul
shot to cutthe deficit once more.
And somehow, some way,
Burke avoided getting swallowed

by Green and two other players
in transition with 35 seconds left,
deftly weaving and flipping the
ball to senior guard Stu Douglass
for the winningbasket.
He was the only player doing
anything for Michigan on offense
in those instances and in other
long stretches against the tena-
cious Spartan defense.
"That kid walks the walk, so
he can talk the talk," said senior
guard Zack Novak. "I've told him,
whatever he says, I'll back him
100 percent."
How funny it now seems that
Wolverine fans were worried
about how the team would be
able to replace Morris. Obviously,
you'd want both players on your
squad, but there's no doubt that,
if forced to pick, you'd go with
Burke - even the freshman ver-
sion - every time. And ina situa-
tion like the NCAA Tournament
game against Duke, who would
you rather have taking a last shot?
Morris, who could never figure
out how to shoot consistenly?
Or Burke, who can hit any sort
of jumper that he damn well
pleases? Perhaps Burke will break
down soon, will hit the prover-
bial freshman wall. It's a valid
concern, considering he averages
34.5 minutes a game, the highest
on the team. But I'm not worried
about it. He just seems to have
that extra something that will
keep that from happening. He's
not like most other players in that
regard, like Spartan guard Keith
Appling, who coach Tom Izzo
said was too fatigued atthe end of
the game. (Appling, a sophomore,
only played 31 minutes.)
This isn't a slight to Tim Hard-
away Jr. or any other Michigan
player, but rather a statement
about Burke's ability. He'll bethe
engine that drives the Wolverines
for as long as he's around Ann
Arbor. After the game, I asked
Beilein where his team would
have been without Burke.
"Don't want to even think
about that," he said.
No need to. Burke is there, and
Michigan need onlybe thankful
for that. Someone get this guy a
nickname.

Yes

- No

Were you awesome today?

Duh
This day and _

Welcome to the Random Student
Interview, where a student's
name is just as interesting as her
major.
Your last name (Nations) is the
plural form, like with an "s" at the
end?
Yeah, like the United ones.
h So you're a Classical Civ major?
That sounds kind of intense.
What does "Civ" even stand for?
It's Classical Civilizations, like histo-
ry. We basically study ancient Greek
and Roman history.
lg
And what do you hope to do with
that?
Be a curator at a museum. (Laughs)
No, I'm joking - I'm actually pre-law.
Well, I'm really bad with politics,
but that major sounds like it'll
help you learn about democracy.
You would know this better than
I would.
Well, (the United States) got ideas
from Roman laws.
7NE

So do you have an internship lined
up for this summer?
Not yet, no. I'm still looking.
What kinds of internships are
open to pre-law people?
Not really anything, because big law
firms don't take summer interns
unless they're in law school. So you
can just hope to get one in Washing-
ton D.C. with some politician, which
is the most likely route students go
with, or you can do stuff in business
because there aren't any prereq-
uisites for law school besides the
LSAT.
The LSAT is so brutal - not like I
would know personally - but my.
roommate took it. As a sopho-
more, have you started thinking
about it?
Well, yes. But I haven't started
thinking about preparation for it.
I'm going abroad in a year, next win-
ter, so probably after that.

Do you speak French?
Yeah, I'm minoring in French.
So that'll help you when you want
to be, like,the French ambassador
or something.
(Laughs) Yeah, exactly.
Do youknow whatkind oflaw you
want to practice?
No, something probably with inter-
national relations, but I'm not posi-
tive.
So something vaguely resembling
your name.
(Laughs) I have yet to meet another
"Nations" on this campus.
Well,mylastnameisArgintar,so I
never meet anyone withmyname.
There's actually only eight Argin-
tars in this world.
How do you know that?
My uncle likes to tell me that -
he's a bit odd. You could probably
Google it, though.
________ _ |sear >
(Laughs)
Where are you headed to next?
Well, I have every single class except
for one in Mason Hall this year.

Landing a job 'after gradu-
ation is no guarantee. In fact,
the job hunt all seems like a big
toss-up. A recent study done by
Georgetown University's Center
on Education and the Workforce
found that unemployment rates
for recent college graduates was
8.9 percent, with students pos-
sessing degrees in architecture
topping the list at a 13.9 percent
unemployment rate.
So what about those people who
don't have a traditional four-year
college degree? What options are
out there for people with associ-
ate's and GEDs?
Where can one go with
an associate's degree?
Student adviser of employment
services at Washtenaw Communi-
ty College Sandra Worrell said it's
certainly possible for one to have a
well-paying job without obtaining
a bachelor's degree first.
"At WCC, we've got tons of
associate's degrees and certifi-
cates (with which) students can go
out after they graduate and get a
good job," Worrell said.
While she said she was unau-
thorized to.disclose specific names
and information of previous WCC
students, Worrell said she person-
ally knew of several students who
landed jobs in computer or tech-
nology fields right after complet-
ing an associate's degree.
She mentioned a student who'd
gotten a job with a local internet
company and quickly moved up
the ladder.
"(The student has) been work-
ing there for a long time ... and I
think he's a manager now," she
said. "He started out as a techni-
cal support specialist doing trou-
bleshooting over the phone when
z 'fA
o \f? t

Is college worth it?
Careers are out there for those
without four-year degrees
by Christine Chun

customers call in."
Other students with associ-
ate's degrees got jobs as computer
support specialists, tier-two and
tier-three networking engineers,
support desk technicians and
network administrators, Worrell
explained.
Computer and information
technology jobs have annual
salaries ranging from $41,000 to
$72,200, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics website.
They also are popular con-
centrations for students at Lan-
sing Community College. James
Woolcock, coordinator of student
employment at LCC, said such
fields tend to be "a bigger draw in
the mid-Michigan area."
"We got a lot of opportunities
for employment as well as intern-
ships or fellowships in (computer
and information technology),"
Woolcock said. "We're seeing a lot
students go into everything from
database administration to pro-
gramming and web design."
A broad spread
But jobs pertaining to comput-
ers or technology aren't the only
options for students, according
to Worrell and Woolcock. Both
advisers listed many other pos-
sible occupations one could have
without spending four years at a
university beforehand.
Among the other jobs Wor-
rell mentioned were positions
in nursing, web design, welding,
culinary arts, physical therapy
or technician posts in pharmacy
and radiology.
"(Students) can all leave here
and get a job right away with-
out a four-year degree," Worrell
said.
Woolcock added that General

Motors is also recruiting students
to go into manufacturing.
"We're seeing the manufactur-
ing sector pick up here with GM,"
Woolcock said. "They're starting
to hire, bring people (from LCC)."
How important is
a bachelor's degree?
BLS statistics suggest that hav-
ing a bachelor's degree is more
advantageous for employment.
According to a BLS Jan. 6 eco-
nomic news release, the unem-
ployment rate for all individuals
with "some college or associate's
degree" is 7.9, whereas for those
with "bachelor's degree and high-
er," the rate is 4.6.
Despite the statistics, Worrell
and Woolcock said people with
associate's degrees and certifi-
cate holders can still land a good
job and earn a decent salary. So is
a bachelor's even worth the time

and effort?
Woolcock and Lynne Sebille-
White, senior assistant director of
employer relations at the Univer-
sity of Michigan; said they think
students should pursue bachelor's
degrees.
Though Woolcock acknowl-
edged that many past LCC stu-
dents were able to earn a good
salary with their associate's
degrees, he stressed the benefits
of having a bachelor's degree.
"There are a number of stu-
dents who can make as good of a
way, (but) just not more so, than
somebody in a bachelor-degree
field," Woolcock said.
According to Woolcock, LCC
encourages students to pursue
higher education, even though it's
common for students to get hired
with just a two-year degree.
"Certainly, over one's lifetime,
they're going to have more earn-
ing potential with a higher-level

degree," he said. "We're always
encouraging people to think about
that (idea) and the lifelong learn-
ing benefits that come with a high-
er degree."
In a similar way, Sebille-White
explained that while for some
jobs, a bachelor's would not be as
useful, having the degree is ben-
eficial in most cases.
"I think a lot of it is definitely
industry specific," Sebille-White
said. "Certainly, for someone
who wants to be an electrician or
plumber, a bachelor's degree isn't
going to help them, and they can
probably still make a good living
(without it)."
But she said in today's world,
employees are more frequently
requiring advanced degrees.
"There are fewer of the higher-
paying opportunities that would
be available to somebody who
doesn't have at least a bachelor's
degree."

Pitching yourself
Behind the interview process
by Kaitlin Williams

You sit down for your job inter-
view. The first question arrives.
"How many people are using
Facebook in San Francisco at
2:30pm on a Friday?"
Why would anyone ask this
question during an interview?
How would you begin to answer
it? And, most importantly, what
would your answer say about you?
A Dec. 28 article on glassdoor.com
placed this question, which was
actually asked at Google job inter-
views, among its "Top 25 Oddball
Interview Questions of 2011."
Lynne Sebille-White, senior
assistant director of employer rela-
tions at the University's Career
Center, said while these "case inter-
view" questions are rare for typical
job interviews, students applying to
jobs in certain fields like consulting
can expect off-the-wall questions
from companies looking to gauge
critical thinking skills.
"Obviously, there's not going
to be an answer for the question,"
"Think about
those times
when you
were a leader,
when you did
something
innovative."
-Megan Budzynski,
senior consumer and
market knowledge
manager at Procter &
Gamble
Sebille-White said. "For some
questions, there could be, but for
a lot of things, they're Hypotheti-
cal. They just want to see how that
(critical thinking) process works."
Sebille-White said behavioral

questions - such as "What are
your strengths?" and "What are
your weaknesses?" - are still the
most popular in job interviews.
While, these are more standard
questions, Sebille-White said
practice is essential to performing
well in everytype of interview.
"Because obviously most
Michigan students are articulate,
they're bright, have great com-
munication skills, they think the
interview part is going to be the
easy part," Sebille-White said.
The Career Center offers half-
hour appointments for mock
interview sessions, which are
conducted by staff members who
record audio and video to review
with the student later.
Students can schedule one
appointment a semester to prac-
tice for interviews for jobs after
graduation, summer internships
and graduate schools.
Sebille-White said students are
urged to dress up for the practice
interview to really get in the right
mindset.
"I think that with any inter-
view prep, one of the key things
is to get beyond prepping in your
head or prepping on paper and
actually getting to articulate your
answers," Sebille-White said.
Students can even practice
working out case interview ques-
tions like, "Why are manhole cov-
ers round?"
While Sebille-White stressed
That interview questions tend
to remain unchanged through-
out the years, more companies
are tweaking their processes to
weed out candidates before an
interview even takes place. She
said more employers are now
conducting pre-interview assess-
ments online.
Olivia Sitto, campus recruit-
er for the satellite TV provider
DISH Network and a 2010 Uni-
versity alum, said DISH utilizes
a pre-hire assessment online as a
part of the multi-step hiring pro-
cess.
DISH Network accepts candi-
dates from all majors, and Sitto
said that the company will be at
today's Winter Career Expo look-
ing for students to fill summer
internship positions. Sitto said

that after the pre-hire assessment,
a behavior-based interview is con-
ducted, followed by a problem-
solving assessment that covers
quantitative reasoning, critical
thinking, verbal ability and inter-
net proficiency.
"We really value your innate
characteristics, like energy, intel-
ligence and need for achievement
a lot more than we value your
actual experiences just because
we feel like those are the things
that can't really be taught," Sitto
said. "Experience can be taught,
on the other hand."
As a recent University gradu-
ate, Sitto advocates using the
Career Center Connector, an online
resource listing employers and job
openings.

"When I was a student, I basi-
cally lived on the Career Center
Connector, and really applied to
everything that I felt I might be
interested in," Sitto said.
Megan Budzynski, senior con=
sumer and market knowledge
manager at Procter & Gamble and
a 2005 University alum, recruits
students for the company but also
helps them prepare for interviews
with rsume reviews and mock
job interviews. Budzynski said the
mock interviews are behavioral-
based and can translate into any
job interview situation, although
they are modeled off of what can-
didates can expect when they
apply for a job or internship with
Procter & Gamble.
For interview advice, Budzyn-

ski said students should under-
stand the company and type of
interview to expect.
Sebille-White said most compa-
nies who conduct case interviews
will inform the candidate before-
hand and provide sample ques-
tions online. Coming prepared to
any interview with specific anec-
dotes is important, Sebille-White
and Budzynski said.
"Really think about those times
when you were a leader, when
you did work with a team, when
you did something innovative,"
Budzynski said.
To those navigating the job
interview process, and some
potentially strange questions,
Budzynski said preparation can
only help.

If so, I apologize to, them and to Lou Gehrig.

Post-grad plans
Students across the different schools and colleges talk about what they want
to do after they graduate and how the University has helped them get there
by Steve Zoski
What are you planning on doing after you graduate? I Has your ideal career changed since you began college?

College is a time for experimentation - making new friends, devel-
oping interests and pursuing romantic partners. But whenall is said
and done, what are you going to do after you graduate? Where are
you going to live, how much will you be paid and does the school
you enter into as a freshman really make a difference as to where
you're headed in the future?
A total of 2,766 students who graduated in 2010 and 2011 were
surveyed by the career centers in six of the University's schools
and colleges. The Statement sought to synthesize the data and
compile it into a comprehensive, user-friendly chart. Below are the
results.

or businessmen?

Get a job. And then go to school later again.

Definitely. I had no idea what I wanted to do when I started and through doing research and pro-
grams like UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program) and taking a variety of classes,
I really found what I like.

I feel like Ross is very much so a career-oriented school, and it focuses on specific things you
would be doing in that job, and it teaches you how to get that job. In that sense it really does do
a good job at preparing you. Recruiters come here all the time, especially in accounting, so I just
kind of struck up a conversation and developed a relationship from that. .
- Jordan Isom, Business junior

I don't know. I always wish I had practiced more. I feel like I could've been ahead coming into the
gate if I had been as disciplined as I am now then. But I mean, things seemed to work out all right
as they are.
