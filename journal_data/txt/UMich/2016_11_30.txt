Since 
the 
trailer 
of 

Comedy Central’s new show 
“Detroiters” 
debuted 
last 

Saturday, some University of 
Michigan students have been 
wrestling with how the city 
will be depicted and the effect 
the show will have on the city 
economically.

The show, green-lighted by 

Comedy Central in October 
2015 and slated to premiere 
Feb. 7, was created by and stars 
Sam Richardson, a Detroit 
native, and Tim Robinson, 
also a Detroit native and a 
“Saturday Night Live” alum. 
The plot centers around two 

advertising agents in their 
pursuit 
of 
the 
automotive 

company Chrysler as a client 
for their firm. The 10-episode 
sitcom was filmed in Detroit 
last 
summer 
and 
features 

landmarks such as the General 
Motors building and Belle Isle.

After watching the trailer, 

LSA freshman Michael Riehs, 
who 
is 
from 
Farmington, 

said he thought the national 
spotlight the city will receive 
from this Portlandia-style of 
direct locational parody will 
ultimately be positive.

“It seems like it’s going to 

be good and it seems like it’ll 
probably be good for Detroit, 
bringing some attention to 
the city,” he said. “Hopefully 

Central Student Government 

executives asked CSG members 
for 
donations 
toward 
CSG’s 

Leadership 
Engagement 

Scholarship at their Tuesday 
meeting through Giving Blueday, 
and CSG President David Schafer 
and CSG Vice President Micah 
Griggs, LSA seniors, discussed 
how to encourage more students 
to be involved.

Schafer and Griggs addressed 

their assembly as guest speakers 
to 
promote 
the 
scholarship 

project, which they spearheaded 
and initiated last month to support 
emerging and established student 
leaders on campus. According to 
Schafer, the initiative has raised 
$100,000 so far.

“We are sitting in a room with 

probably 50 of us. Even if you give 
a dollar, that’s 50 dollars right 
there,” Griggs said.

The 
scholarship 
aims 
to 

relieve the financial burden of 
membership dues and unpaid time 
commitments that go into being 
involved in a campus organization. 
Schafer said the assembly wanted 
to 
increase 
involvement 
in 

student organization because it is 
a valuable part of the university 
experience that students will 
reflect back on after graduation.

“On a larger scale, we are 

committed 
to 
this 
life-long 

engaged learning outside of the 
classroom that the Leadership 
Engagement 
Scholarship 
will 

advance,” Schafer said. “In 20 or 

30 years we might not remember 
what we’ve done inside of the 
classroom but I can guarantee 
you that the work we have done 
outside of the classroom will 
transcend that period.”

CSG 
held 
an 
information 

session about the scholarship last 
month to spread awareness and 
answer the questions of interested 
student leaders, though f ew 
students not on the body were 
in attendance. The scholarship 
can apply toward any area of 
student life, including Greek life, 
student government, performing 

arts 
and 
entrepreneurship 

organizations. It can be awarded 
to 
undergraduate, 
graduate 

and professional emerging or 
established student leaders.

In her remarks Tuesday, Griggs 

connected the scholarship to the 
reality of a college student with 
financial burdens, and said CSG 
could contribute to the degree to 
which students are involved.

“There 
are 
students 
that 

have to go to work to put 
themselves through college, to 
pay for the necessities, or just 
the littlest things,” Griggs said. 

“Automatically it’s a barrier for 
students to get involved.”

Speaking specifically to Giving 

Blueday, the 24-hour University-
wide 
fundraising 
event 
for 

students and the surrounding 
community 
to 
support 
the 

program or department or their 
choosing, Schafer and Griggs 
urged members of the body to 
continue donating to their own 
organization through the Giving 
Blueday’s 
website 
for 
their 

scholarship.

The Michigan Daily recently 

administered a women’s health 
survey to 1,000 randomly selected 
respondents at the University of 
Michigan campus. There were 

147 respondents, with 115 self-
identifying as female.

Late nights freshman year 

going out with her new friends 
at the University of Michigan 
didn’t make now-LSA sophomore 
Vianney Flores want to drink — in 
fact, though she experienced peer 
pressure, her experience helped 
her commit further to abstaining 

from alcohol consumption.

“In the beginning, when I first 

met my friends, it was like, ‘Why 
aren’t you drinking? Come on, 
drink,’ ” Flores said.

Fitting in at party, she said, 

requires a solo cup in your hand.

“There was so much pressure, 

but I would just say no … they 
wouldn’t shut up until I said I 

don’t like the taste,” Flores said.

In the Daily’s survey, 16.52 

percent 
of 
the 
all-female 

respondents 
said 
they 
never 

drink alcohol and 21.74 percent 
said they rarely drink. Nearly 34 
percent said they drink weekly 
and the remaining 27.83 percent 
of respondents reported drinking

Approximately 
two 
dozen 

individuals gathered Tuesday 
in North Quad for a lecture 
on 
how 
fragmented 
media 

outlets increase the political 
polarization of their viewers, 
and possible resolutions to the 
trend.

Magdalena 
Wojcieszak, 

associate professor of political 
communication at the University 
of 
Amsterdam, 
described 

to attendees why the rise of 
fragmented media — a trend in 
which modern viewers consume 
media that cements their own 
political beliefs — raises the 
chances of viewer selectivity 
and polarization. She said this 
concern is especially important 
in light of the current U.S. 
political environment and a 
modern influx of information 
sources.

“When 
we 
have 
this 

unprecedented 
choice 
(of 

sources), which we now do, we 
can be more selective in what we 
see and hear,” Wojcieszak said.

University of Michigan 

alum and U.S. Rep. Tom 
Price (R-GA) will be a 
member of President-elect 
Donald Trump’s cabinet as 
head of the Department of 
Health and Human Services, 
Trump announced Tuesday 
morning.

Price was born in 

Lansing and received his 
Bachelor and Doctor of 
Medicine degrees from 
the University before 
completing orthopaedic 
surgery residency at Emory 
University in Georgia. Price 
has served as a U.S. Rep. 
from Georgia since 2004 
and chairs the House Budget 
Committee.

As the head of the HHS, 

Price will advise Trump on 

health and medical matters. 
Price is a notable opponent 
of the Affordable Care Act 
and has introduced the 
Empowering Patients First 
Act as an alternative to 
Obamacare. Under Price’s 
plan, individuals would 
receive age-adjusted tax 
credits when purchasing 
insurance and it would 
also allow insurers to sell 
policies across state lines in 
an effort to drive down costs 
by making insurance more 
competitive.

“True health reform 

in this country must put 
patients first while working 
to improve accessibility to, 
and affordability of, quality 
health care,” Price said 
in a press release on the 

legislation. “Rather than 
granting government more 
authority in the lives of 
patients and their doctors, 
we must seek reforms that 
empower patients while 
advancing the principles of 
accessibility, affordability, 
and quality of care.”

Trump’s platform 

included repealing the ACA, 
and Trump said he will work 
with Congress to reform 
healthcare and broaden 
healthcare access according 
to free market principles.

“(Price is) exceptionally 

qualified to shepherd our 
commitment to repeal and 
replace Obamacare and bring 
affordable and accessible 
healthcare to every 
American,” Trump wrote in 

his cabinet announcement. 

At a University event 

in September 2015, Price 
expressed his concerns about 
Trump as a presidential 
candidate.

“What concerns me about 

Trump is not necessarily 
his policy positions, but 
we know what it feels like 
to have a president that 
oversteps their bounds on 
regulations and rules,” 
Price said, referring to 
President Barack Obama. 
“And when I hear Trump 
saying things like ‘I’ll just 
do XYZ’ without seemingly 
any regard for the legislative 
branch, it gives me some 
thought.”

leaders like you,” Schafer said. 
“Help us provide the opportunities 
we have been given to help shape 

our personal growth and our 
professional development. That’s 
what we really hope to do with this 
scholarship.”

“That’s my only ask of you 

tonight,” he continued. “It’s to 
consider to give to the leadership 
scholarship. In the hopes to make 

more student leaders like all of you. 
And for you to ask your friends and 
families to give.”

Schafer noted that though 

Giving Blueday only lasts 24 
hours, the link to donate to the 
scholarship will always remain 
open to accept future donations.

“It (the link) is open the 

entire year… You can give to 
the scholarship after Giving 
Blueday just like you could give 
to the scholarship before Giving 
Blueday,” he said.

While the assembly did not 

attach a specific fundraising goal 
to the scholarship since it is newly 
developed, Schafer said his goal 
was $10,000.

“The reason we didn’t set a 

goal is because this initiative is 
very much in its infant stage… 
to us, we have already been 
successful regardless of what 
we raised because we launched 
the scholarship and we raised 
awareness and inspired people 
along the way,” Schafer said. “But 
I think $10,000 would be great.”

Though 
the 
scholarship 

is already endowed, Schafer 
emphasized that CSG wants 
to raise even more money to 
increase 
the 
scholarship’s 

endowment.

“We 
have 
already 
raised 

$100,000 toward the scholarship 
and at the University of Michigan, 
you only need $25,000 to endow a 
scholarship,” Schafer said.

about climate change following 
the election.

“I’ve 
been 
struggling 

with 
optimism 
related 
to 

the environment, but we’ve 
been getting more active and 

doing more education, so I 
think the election has created 
more 
people 
being 
active 

in the political realm and 
environmental issues as the 
whole,” Toweh said.

The 
three 
panelists 

individually 
presented 

concerns 
focusing 
on 
how 

climate policy will be affected 
in the future and what part 

people can play in the issue.

Citing data from the National 

Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 

Association, Engineering Prof. 
Richard Rood, who specializes 
in climate impact, emphasized 
the topic of climate science 
including global temperatures, 
rising sea levels and ocean 
temperature.

He also underlined that the 

scientific evidence supporting 
the theory of climate change 
was only one of the issues when 
addressing climate change as a 
society.

“The social and political 

aspects are much more difficult 
than the technological aspects 
for how to deal with this 
problem,” Rood said.

Stacy Coyle, a lecturer with 

the Program in the Environment, 
cited the Paris Agreement as one 
social and political response to 
climate change. The agreement, 
which was signed on April 22, 
2016, is an international pact 
addressing political and financial 
strategies 
for 
addressing 

greenhouse gas emissions.

Coyle 
emphasized 
the 

extensive 
international 

participation in the agreement 
as ratified by 55 countries who 
represent 55 percent of total 
global 
emissions. 
She 
also 

addressed concerns over the 
possibility and legality of the 
United 
States 
withdrawing 

from 
the 
treaty, 
another 

campaign promise of Trump’s.

“The U.S. cannot withdraw 

until November of 2019,” Coyle 
said. “It makes me breath just a 
little easier.”

The 
Paris 
Agreement 

outlines that the signed parties 
like the United States cannot 
withdraw from the treaty for 

another three years, according 
to Article 28 of the agreement 
itself. However, under U.S. 
law, 
participation 
in 
any 

international treaty can be 
terminated by the president 
under U.S. law. Scholars have 
suggested potential effects of 
leaving the treaty could range 
from loss in global standing to 
potential difficulties for the 
U.S. on issues such as trade and 
terrorism in the future.

Sally 
Churchill, 
professor 

of 
environmental 
law 
and 

policy in the School of Natural 
Resources and Environment, 
noted 
that 
disassembling 

environmental 
regulations 

would 
be 
difficult 
and 

unlikely. She emphasized the 
importance of local action and 
public recognition and concern 
for the issue by highlighting a 
New York Times article about 
towns in Alaska threatened by 
climate change.

“As an environmental lawyer, 

I am very optimistic,” Churchill 
said. “People care about climate 
change. I walked into this room 
on a Tuesday night thinking 
there might be 15 to 20 people 
and it’s packed. Climate change 
is not going away.”

Churchill 
also 
said 
she 

thought it was important for 
people to continue to engage 
with 
environmental 
issues 

across political divisions.

“Climate change is not an 

issue of party,” Churchill said. 
“We have to keep finding 
allies everywhere to advance 
the important activities and 
address any disagreements we 
may have.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Melanie 

Chasseur, who attended the event, 
said she was initially concerned 
for the future of environmental 
policy after the election, but 
like Churchill, is focusing on 
the potential for unity around 
environmental issues.

“Feedback 
is 
really 

important 
between 
people 

that are knowledgeable on the 
issue and people that aren’t 
active about it, and we need to 
integrate people that might not 
understand,” Chasseur said.

LSA 
freshman 
Kristen 

Hayden said she thought that 
the discussion was effective in 
addressing climate change due 
to the different backgrounds of 
the panelists.

“I liked that there were so 

many 
different 
viewpoints,” 

Hayden said. “They had such a 
different range in experiences, 
from the professor who worked 
with NASA to the professor who 
is an environmental lawyer, 
and I thought those different 
interests influenced how they 
talked about the subject.”

side, said she had concerns 
about the show going too far 
in terms of displaying the city 
in a way that is humorous, but 
inappropriate.

“The 
issue 
is 
that, 
I 

understand that it’s supposed 
to be funny but my worry is that 
it’s going to make an even bigger 
joke out of Detroit than it already 
is, because Detroit already has 
such 
negative 
connotations 

associated with it as far as the 
economy, frankly, the Black 
people, that live there,” Green 
said.

Green said the show should 

neither glorify nor romanticize 
the city in its depictions.

“When most people see or 

when they hear Detroit, they 
think of all the bad — the gang 
violence, the violence in general, 

the economy just going down, 
the way that it looks right now 
or from what they show, because 
not all parts are bad,” Green 
said. “With that, I hope they 
would show more of the good 
parts while still including the 
bad so it’s not biased towards 
one way.” 

While 
LSA 
senior 
Yara 

Beydoun, who is from Dearborn 
and works in Detroit, also 
acknowledged that the city will 
receive national attention from 
the show, she said she was afraid 
the show will focus solely on 
select areas of Detroit, like the 
Downtown-Midtown-Corktown 
area. She said an overview of 
the city might gloss over the 
crucial problems facing the 
lower-income 
neighborhoods 

of Detroit, including blight and 
infrastructural damages.

“I’m a little bit confused,” 

Beydoun said. “It just seemed 
like 
(the 
trailer) 
was 
very 

focused on the downtown area 
of Detroit … but I don’t know 
how representative of actual 
Detroit the show is going to be.”

While a more clear sense 

of how the show will depict 
Detroit won’t be revealed until 
its premiere, both Beydoun and 
Riehs said they were glad that 
the show chose to film in the city 
instead of in another city set to 
resemble Detroit.

Jenell 
Leonard, 
Michigan 

Film & Digital Media Office 
director, told the Detroit Free 
Press this past January that 
with no tax breaks or financial 
incentives, 
“Detroiters” 

being filmed in Detroit takes 
determination by the production 
company,

“We thank Comedy Central 

for taking a risk on us,” Leonard 

said. “People think because it’s 
called ‘Detroiters,’ it has to be 
done in Detroit … To say that 
we landed a TV series in a post-
incentives climate, that is huge.”

Legislation 
providing 
tax 

incentives for film and television 
is in place in many states across 
the country in hopes that the 
production 
companies 
bring 

with their projects additional 
revenue for the city and local 
businesses 
and 
commonly 

sought-after publicity. Michigan 
provided incentives for several 
years, but in July 2015, Michigan 
Gov. Rick Snyder (R) signed 
legislation 
that 
dissolved 

Michigan’s 
tax 
incentive 

programs for film and television 
production companies. Before 
the legislation, films such as 
“Batman v. Superman: Dawn 
of Justice,” “Red Dawn” and 
multiple “Transformers” movies 

were filmed in the state. 

No matter what the show 

chooses to satirize, Reihs said if 
the city is making money from 
this promotion, then the show 
will have a positive effect on the 
city’s economy.

“If (the show) is going to 

bring people to Detroit and put 
money into the city, that’s a good 
thing,” he said.

Beydoun said she was glad 

the show decided to film in 
the city despite not knowing 
what elements of Detroit the 
show will explore. She added 
that simply filming in the city 
itself is a positive first step in 
reforming the nation’s view of 
real Detroiters.

“Detroit has a lot of negative 

stereotypes, but it’s a beautiful 
city with a lot of great people,” 
she said. “I think everyone there 
wants the best for the city.”

twice weekly or more.

For this 16 percent of women, 

the college environment can 
feel isolating in a social scene of 
alcohol consumption — making 
them unique in a sea of students 
drinking and partying.

In interviews, some of these 

women said their decisions about 
drinking are tied to religious 
beliefs or stems from safety 
concerns. They also said it is 
impacted by their friends, family 
and the resources available to 
them at the University.

The data largely fits with 

results from the University’s 
2016 National College Health 
Assessment survey — which 
received a response from 2,515 
undergraduates, graduate and 
professional students. The survey 
found that in the 30 days prior to 
taking the survey, 28 percent of 
students reported they had not 
drank, while 72 percent reported 
they 
had. 
Additionally, 
40 

percent of respondents reported 
having experienced high-risk 
drinking, defined as more than 
four drinks for females and more 
than five drinks for males in the 

last two weeks.

Flores said she stressed to her 

friends her choices stem simply 
from personal preference — she 
wasn’t judging them. She also 
added that her decision to not 
drink has been influenced by 
her parents’ desire for her safety, 
news stories about sexual assault, 
the negative health effects and a 
genuine aversion to the taste.

“I tried to tell them ‘I’m 

not judging you guys,’ ” Flores 
said. “It’s just my choice. I feel 
like they thought I was there 

thinking, ‘You guys are stupid.’ 
No, that wasn’t the case.”

Though both the University 

and the Daily’s surveys show a 
significant group of University 
students do not engage in high-
risk 
drinking, 
research 
has 

shown that the majority of people 
underage do, in a departure from 
the campus trend. About 90 
percent of the alcohol consumed 
by youth under the age of 21 in 
the United States is in the form 
of binge drinks, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.

The 
University 
Health 

Service website states, “Most 
students grow up in a culture 
which equates the consumption 
of alcohol with having fun, 
relaxing, 
making 
social 

situations complete and reducing 
tension.”

LSA junior Alexis Babbitt 

cited her religion as one of 
the reasons she doesn’t drink. 
Babbitt said in the way she 
understands 
her 
Christian 

beliefs, drinking before it is 
legal is not acceptable.

“I’ve 
never 
been 
drunk,” 

Babbitt said. “God tells me to 
follow the law and the law is 
to not drink under 21 and I am 
under 21 so I don’t drink.”

LSA freshman Gabrielle de 

Coster said she is not afraid to 
drink, even though she chooses 
not to in part for religious 
reasons, because she believes 
would know her limits. Instead, 
for her, not drinking translates 
to a more meaningful social 
experiences.

“I don’t feel that I am serving 

God to the best of my ability 
or spreading light in any way 
if my awareness of myself or 
surroundings 
is 
deluded 
by 

any substance,” de Coster said. 
“Faith and family history aside, 
I don’t want to be forgetting 
anything and I want the friends 
who I surround myself with to 
be friends who can make me 
laugh when I am not under the 
influence.”

Babbitt echoed her sentiments, 

saying while she understands 
college 
students’ 
desire 
to 

drink, she prefers smaller social 
environments to larger parties 

where everyone’s drinking.

“I know people say it adds 

an element of fun and lightness 
to a night out,” Babbitt said. “I 
have gone to parties but I don’t 

like being the only sober one at 
a party. I’d rather hang out with 
a smaller group of friends and 
watch a movie. I understand 
that people drink but it is not 
something that I find necessary.”

Flores said she is glad to 

have never had the disorienting 
experience of “blacking out” 
from 
alcohol 
consumption, 

noting that the kind of parties 
she attends don’t present the 
risks 
associated 
with 
heavy 

alcohol consumption.

“I like going to parties because 

it’s fun, you’re just hanging 
around with friends and things 
like that; I just don’t like being 
drunk,” Flores said. “After my 
friends understood that, I still 
liked to have fun even without 
drinking and I’m OK with them 
drinking … The environment 
is fun and they forget I’m not 
drunk sometimes. So I don’t feel 
uncomfortable.”

The main reason for their 

choices not to drink for some 
students also isn’t just about 
having fun. De Coster said her 
reasons not to drink also stem 
from a familial influence, but 
in her case, experiences with 
alcoholism have also impacted 
her choices in college.

“I have alcoholism that runs 

in my family and so I have seen 
the other side that isn’t just light 
dancing and a little giggling,” de 
Coster said. “I have seen people 
have to go to jail and the dark side 
of alcohol. College is definitely 
the stepping stone for that type 
of alcohol consumption.”

That “other side” of drinking 

is not absent from campus, even 
though many students don’t 
report heavily drinking regularly. 
Alcohol-related incidents have 
increased on campus in the past 
year; there were 561 incidents 
of students illegally consuming 
or possessing alcohol at the 
University last year, an increase 
from the 515 incidents the year 
prior, according to the Office 
of Student Conflict Resolution 
annual report.

The 
University, 
Central 

Student 
Government 
and 

UMix 
have 
also 
expanded 

the availability of resources 
encouraging students to find 
alternatives to parties in recent 
years.

UMix, a program Flores said 

she frequently attends, offers 
late night activities — crafts, 
live entertainment, recreational 
sports, dances and other social 
events — on about half of all Friday 
nights in the semester to cater to 
students who choose not to drink. 
CSG also held its third sober 
tailgate earlier this semester. LSA 
sophomore Grant Rivas, CSG 
chief programming officer, said 
he felt the reputation of college 
students drinking and partying 
does not hold for everyone at the 
University of Michigan.

“If you read the newspaper, 

a lot of times you hear about 
college students just partying 
all the time, and that’s actually 
kind of not what we’ve noticed 
is representative of the whole 
UMich population,” Rivas said.

Along with sober tailgating 

efforts, 
CSG 
has 
sponsored 

hydration stations in front of 
partnering Greek life houses as 
well as begun funding University 
Dining 
to 
open 
earlier 
on 

Saturdays to encourage students 
to eat before tailgating.

Ultimately, Rivas said it is 

a necessity for resources to be 
made available to the noticeable 
population 
of 
students 
who 

do not drink — and for Flores, 
University resources have helped 
support her choice.

“If I can have fun without 

alcohol, there’s no need for me 
to add alcohol to the mix,” Flores 
said.

polarization by offering a wide 
range of viewpoints, the natural 
human 
tendency 
to 
process 

information with bias hinders 
that goal. Biased information 
processing, she added leads to 
people 
interpreting 
articles 

through their own prejudices.

“We have known for quite 

many decades that people see 
what they want to see,” she 
said. “We tend to interpret 
information 
in 
a 
way 
that 

reinforces our beliefs.”

Wojcieszak 
also 
discussed 

how 
viewer 
selectivity 
and 

polarization might be attenuated 
in the media, her primary topic 
of study. She highlighted data 
from two experimental studies 
she conducted which showed 
individuals were more willing 
to consider differing opinions 
when they realized they shared 
a common social identity with 
others who held these opinions. 
In 
particular, 
it 
encouraged 

viewer selection of balanced 
content, lowered hostility and 

social 
distance 
toward 
out-

groups and increased individual 
acceptance of messages from 
outgroups.

“If we make this overarching 

shared identity salient, biased 
processing and polarization will 
diminish and also selectivity will 
be lower,” Wojcieszak said.

She said this research can be 

applied to the current state of 
media, as unlimited content and 
social media have profoundly 
changed the channels through 

which 
people 
receive 
their 

information. Wojcieszak offered 
several ideas on how to apply 

her findings to projects in the 
future, challenging media outlets 
to present information in a way 
that’s accessible to members of 
all social groups.

“So for instance, in the context 

of social networks, we can 
think of priming the in-group 
endorsement of an out-group 
and that’s also something that I 
would like to look at (in future 
research),” she said.

Rackham student Sage Lee 

said she attended the talk because 
the topic tied into her interests 
on the potential ways in which 
media can reduce polarization 
across various identities.

“My research is deeply related 

to what she’s trying to do, like 
intervening 
political 
spheres 

and finding the role of the media 
in terms of facilitating a more 
constructive 
public 
sphere 

that can motivate individuals 
to lessen the chasms or gaps 
among individuals when they’re 
categorizing 
themselves 
as 

in-groups and out-groups,” she 
said.

Lee added that she appreciated 

how Wojcieszak presented her 
research and findings in an 
organized, 
easily 
understood 

way.

“I 
think 
she 
showed 
a 

systematic approach in how her 
research, how her efforts and 
endeavors to this field, unfold 
over time,” Lee said. “I think 
those kinds of things were 
the biggest strengths of the 
conversation she presented to 
us.”

A

s the transition to a 
Trump 
presidency 

takes 
shape, 
one 
of 

the most uncertain issues is 
climate 
change. 
In 

October, 
I 
wrote 

a 
piece 
exploring 

Trump’s position on 
climate change and 
the prominence the 
issue warranted in 
the 
election. 
Well, 

the issue was hardly 
mentioned in any of 
the 
three 
debates, 

and we still do not 
know for certain what 
our next president plans to do 
regarding climate change. In the 
face of this uncertainty, we must 
explore what he could have the 
power to do as president and how 
far he could set us back in terms 
of climate change.

Trump’s previous statements 

on climate change don’t leave 
much promise; the most glaring 
example is when he tweeted 
that “the concept of global 
warming was created by and 
for the Chinese in order to 
make U.S. manufacturing non-
competitive.” This was in 2012, 
when he wasn’t even a candidate 
for president. He has since called 
climate change a “hoax” and 
“bullshit,” but more threatening 
are the actions he has suggested 
throughout the campaign. The 
long list is highlighted by a desire 
to “cancel” the Paris climate 
agreement and to essentially 
eliminate 
the 
Environmental 

Protection 
Agency, 
leaving 

behind just “tidbits.”

It’s easy to speak, but let’s 

look at the actions Trump has 
taken so far. The EPA is where 
he could realistically have the 
easiest time causing the most 
trouble, and he’s already started 
making his moves. To lead his 
EPA transition team, he chose 
Myron Ebell, a man who denies 
climate change and thinks that 
even if it were real, it would be 
beneficial. He wants to destroy 
the Clean Power Plan, one of 
President Barack Obama’s most 
influential climate policies and 
has previously been credited 
with helping destroy “cap-and-
trade.” In 2007, he was called an 
“oil industry mouthpiece,” and 
when we couple his leadership 
with Trump’s desire to defund 
the EPA, it does not look good. 
This is all to say: It seems like 
Trump wants to destroy the 
EPA, and he may very well be 
able to do so.

Coupled with the EPA are 

the many regulations Obama 
has set in motion to implement. 
The Clean Power Plan, central 
to Obama’s goal to decrease 

emissions, is in the crosshairs. 
The 
already-controversial 

regulation will most likely be 
taken up by the Supreme Court 

next year, and with 
Trump 
in 
office, 

its fate looks bleak. 
Trump can’t destroy 
the 
plan 
single-

handedly, but he can 
weaken its chances 
of passing. In terms 
of other guidelines, 
Trump can use the 
Office of Information 
and 
Regulatory 

Affairs, 
a 
group 

of lawyers who are the final 
stop before any regulation gets 
enacted, in order to significantly 
slow, weaken or eliminate some 
of the other regulations Obama 
has set in motion. Finally, by 
cutting funding for regulations, 
Trump can reach around having 
to repeal regulations while still 
making them essentially useless.

The big fish would be the Paris 

climate agreement, an agreement 
of 193 countries to come together 
as a global community and 
limit carbon emissions. A U.S. 
withdrawal would have two 
major effects. First, the United 
States’ plan for limiting emissions 
to 22 billion tons of carbon dioxide 
by 2030 is supposed to account for 
roughly 20 percent of the entire 
agreement, according to Climate 
Interactive. This in and of itself is 
an incredibly harmful effect, but 
if the rest of the world looks to the 
United States and sees that we are 
ignoring the issue, many other 
countries can be expected to 
back out, causing a domino effect 
that will significantly weaken 
the agreement. Second, if China, 
the only country that emits more 
carbon dioxide than us, holds 
steady on the plan, the United 
States would effectively hand 
over its moral and worldwide 
leadership on the issue to the 
Chinese. In no uncertain terms, 
Donald Trump withdrawing the 
United States from the agreement 
could be one of the greatest 
setbacks in climate policy we 
have ever faced.

There are many obstacles 

Trump would have to surpass 

to withdraw the United States 
from the agreement — most 
importantly, his own desire 
to 
do 
so. 
Public 
opinion 

shows that a large amount of 
Americans care about climate 
change and would not want to 
see Trump follow through on 
his promise. Moreover, Trump 
would have to deal with the 
other 192 countries that signed 
the deal. It is a big risk for him 
to anger the rest of the world 
by withdrawing this late, thus 
hurting foreign relations.

On a similar note, Trump 

would be opening the door for 
China to take over our global 
leadership 
role 
and 
would 

diminish our influence abroad. 
Finally, we don’t even know 
if Trump was every really 
committed to withdrawing in 
the first place or whether it 
was simply campaign rhetoric. 
A Reuters report indicating 
that Trump’s transition team 
is looking for ways to bypass 
the four-year procedure for 
withdrawing is not a positive 
sign, but there is reason to 
believe Trump does not want to 
and will not follow through.

Simply put, Trump cannot 

just 
snap 
his 
fingers 
and 

destroy Obama’s climate legacy. 
However, if he wants to, he could 
significantly undermine some of 
Obama’s accomplishments and 
even threaten global progress. All 
is not yet lost, but for those who 
care about climate change, the 
next few months will be some of 
the most critical in our lifetime. 
Trump, if he cares enough and 
devotes 
enough 
resources, 

could squash some of Obama’s 
most important regulations and 
agreements, or he could not. If he 
chooses to, he could face a fight of 
his lifetime from environmental 
groups, Democrats and even 
some Republicans.

Unrelenting 
pressure 
on 

Donald Trump is how we fight 
for climate progress. If we lose 
that, we must keep fighting 
on the local level. Michael 
Bloomberg 
plans 
to 
push 

movements to make cities more 
green, regardless of Trump. 
This, as well as electing and 
pushing local officials to support 
climate-friendly positions, is 
how we deal if the top of the 
government 
pushes 
against. 

A 
bottom-to-top 
movement 

energized by the people can 
help minimize Trump’s long-
term effect on climate change 
and our world.

Trump will have lasting effects on climate

The ironic twist of Standing Rock

INA GONZALEZ, WASIF KUNDI & JUSTIN SLICK | OP-ED

T

hanksgiving 
is 
an 

American 
holiday 

that 
celebrates 
the 

coming together of the Native 
Americans and the Pilgrims. 
Every 
fourth 
Thursday 
of 

November, we gather with our 
friends and family to enjoy 
each other’s company and to 
give thanks for what we have. 
However, after almost four 
centuries of carrying on this 
tradition, we often forget the 
celebration commemorates the 
peaceful union of two different 
cultures. 

Today, we take for granted 

the generous hospitality offered 
by the Native Americans to 
the newly arrived Pilgrims. 
We learn throughout our lives 
what this day is supposed to 
mean, yet when it comes to 
application we begin to draw 
blanks. As a society, we have 
replaced the original meaning 
of commemoration with mass 
consumption of food, football 
and parades.

Our 
country’s 
change 
of 

heart can be seen in the current 
proceedings of the North Dakota 
Access Pipeline situation. For 
example, its most recent gift 
given to the native population 
was a bracing shower in freezing 
temperatures while they were 
attempting 
to 
protect 
their 

sacred lands. This pipeline has 
remained a headline issue that 
became 
highlighted 
during 

election season and has thrived 
due to the controversy of the 
situation.

The most recent controversy 

comes to head in an ironic twist, 
as protesters have been mowed 
down by the very resource 
that they have been fighting 
to protect. Amid struggles to 
protect reserved Sioux land, 
protesters 
have 
spent 
the 

recent months protesting the 
construction 
of 
the 
North 

Dakota Access Pipeline. The 
primary 
reasoning 
behind 

this now-classic struggle is all 
in the name of human rights 
and how large corporations 
have been suppressing these 
intangible rights for decades. It 
is seen by the native population 
that protecting their land is 
now an even higher priority 
than what it once was.

The original plan for the 

North Dakota Access Pipeline 
had intended for it to run just 
north of the capital of the 
state, 
Bismarck. 
Seeing 
as 

there was mass opposition to 
these plans, the construction 
company decided to relocate 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
pipeline 

through the Standing Rock 
Sioux reservation, where its 
construction 
is 
currently 

being peacefully protested by 
a generous mix of people. The 
coincidence with the movement 
of the pipeline construction is 
that the majority of Bismarck 
is 
composed 
of 
a 
white 

population and therefore had 
a louder voicing of opinion in 
the entirety of the situation. 
Their 
complaints 
are 
the 

same as those of the residents 
of Standing Rock: potential 
water 
pollution 
from 
any 

possible runoff due to the 
pipeline’s activity in carrying 
oil. 
Even 
with 
the 
same 

concerns, 
the 
construction 

continues without regard to 
the protesters’ efforts that 
are driven by environmental 
and public health concerns in 
addition to simply not wanting 
the pipeline on their land.

What this whole situation 

represents 
is 
the 
blatant 

disregard for human rights 
when it gets in the way 
of potential profit for the 
corporations 
involved. 
This 

type of behavior has been 
exhibited across the world and 
has tended to lead to reforms 
— if not revolts — by those 
who have been oppressed by 
such corporations who seem 
to seek money over all else. 
It is an amazement that even 
though this land is protected 
by federal statutes, there has 
been no sort of government 
intervention in the assistance 
of helping these native people 
in securing their land against a 
private entity that they have no 
desire of allowing to desecrate 
their land and potentially their 
water supply.

If these sort of public outcries 

are listened to when they come 
from a white community, yet 
not one of minorities, then 
this stands as proof of the 
lack of true equal opportunity 
and 
representation 
within 

this country that we deem as 
modern America.

Obama’s Cuban legacy may be in peril

MELISSA STRAUSS | COLUMN

F

idel 
Castro, 
the 

revolutionary 
Cuban 

leader who led his country 

toward communism and the world 
toward the brink of nuclear war, 
died last Friday at 90 
years old. Upon the 
news of his death, we 
witnessed just how 
divisive a figure he 
truly was. While many 
Cubans rejoiced at the 
news, others mourned 
the loss of their former 
leader. 
Across 
the 

Caribbean, 
Castro’s 

death amplifies the 
question of President-
elect Donald Trump’s commitment 
to normalizing relations between 
our two countries. Following five 
decades of a failed isolationist 
policy toward Cuba, it would be 
a grave mistake for Trump to 
roll back the progress President 
Barack Obama has made in the 
U.S.-Cuban relationship over the 
past two years.

When Castro catapulted to 

power on Jan. 8, 1959, creating 
the first communist state in the 
Western Hemisphere, he quickly 
took control of nearly all aspects 
of Cuban life. Castro ruled with 
a heavy, repressive and often 
brutal hand, while at the same 
time providing the country with 
improved public services. He 
severely restricted political and 
economic freedoms in Cuba, 
including 
banning 
opposition 

newspapers, 
prohibiting 

elections and ordering political 
opponents and dissenters to be 
jailed and sometimes killed. After 
Castro nationalized all U.S.-
owned businesses on the island 
in 1960, the United States ceased 
diplomatic relations with the 
country (which President Obama 
reinstated last year) and imposed 
a trade embargo on Cuba that 
still remains today. However, his 
legacy often evokes a mixture of 
feelings as Castro also provided 
the 
country 
with 
improved 

health 
care 
and 
education, 

eliminated legal discrimination 
and increased availability of 
electricity in the countryside.

It is true that many aspects 

of Fidel Castro’s repressive rule 
remain today under his brother 
Raúl’s leadership. In fact, between 
January and October of this year, 
more than 9,000 political prisoners 
were detained — four times as 
many than in 2010. However, 

reversing the progress made in 
U.S.-Cuban relations will likely 
worsen the issue, not improve the 
prospects of the Cuban people. 
As Elizardo Sánchez, the founder 

of the Cuban Human 
Rights and National 
Reconciliation 
Commission, 
argues, 

“The personal contact 
that comes from all 
the travel (from the 
United States) has a 
huge impact in terms 
of fighting propaganda 
… In a closed society, 
the 
door 
can 
only 

be opened a bit at a 

time. It’s going very slowly, but 
it’s happening.” While there is 
certainly room for improvement, 
we cannot reasonably expect 
Cuban society — which has been 
closed for more than 50 years — 
to completely open overnight. 
If we maintain and improve 
our relationship with Cuba, we 
can arm the Cuban people with 
knowledge and empower them 
to fight for their own rights in a 
way they may not have had the 
opportunity to before. 

But 
under 
the 
Trump 

administration, this may prove to 
be a difficult task. Trump posted 
a tweet on Monday morning 
threatening to terminate recently 
renewed 
diplomatic 
relations 

between the United States and 
Cuba “If Cuba is unwilling to 
make a better deal for the Cuban 
people, 
the 
Cuban/American 

people and the U.S. as a whole.” 
While I am choosing to believe 
that President-elect Trump has 
the best interests of both the 
Cuban and American people at 
heart, I fully oppose his threat 
to reverse the headway made in 
normalizing U.S.-Cuban relations. 
Our 
past 
strategy 
of 
harsh 

restrictions and trade embargoes 
was simply unsuccessful. The 
Castros 
remained 
in 
power 

despite U.S. actions while the 
Cuban people suffered immensely 
from 
deteriorating 
economic 

conditions. Human rights were 
still violated, political prisoners 
were still detained and the Cuban 
people were still unable to provide 
for 
themselves 
financially. 
If 

history means anything, there 
will be no “better deal” in Cuba’s 
future. I agree that the United 
States 
absolutely 
should 
not 

support a repressive government. 
However, I also believe it is against 

our American values to abandon 
the Cuban people. With the 
opening of diplomatic relations 
between the two countries, we 
allow an opportunity to work 
together, to repair our differences 
and to help the Cuban government 
better provide for its citizens.

Since 
President 
Obama 

reinstated 
relations 
with 

Cuba, millions of dollars have 
been spent on business deals, 
especially 
in 
the 
tourism 

industry. As recently as Monday, 
the United States began flying 
direct 
commercial 
flights 

bringing American tourists and 
Cuban-Americans to the island. 
As the economic situation on the 
island improves with American 
investments, it is only logical to 
assume that the Cuban people 
may begin fighting for increased 
political freedoms now that 
their first worry no longer has 
to do with whether or not they 
will be able to feed their family 
for 
the 
week. 
Additionally, 

better relations benefit not only 
the Cuban economy, but also 
American 
businesses 
looking 

for new ventures in which to 
invest. Reversing this progress 
will produce a severe blow to the 
industries in Cuba that have seen 
business rise considerably in the 
past couple of years.

To 
add 
insult 
to 
injury, 

the 
Cuban 
government 
has 

historically always been suspicious 
of American intentions. President-
elect Trump’s hostile position 
will add fuel to a fire that has only 
recently dimmed to a smolder. 
Not only is Trump’s ultimatum 
seen as an attack on the economic 
improvements that have been 
made, but also as a direct assault 
on 
Cuba’s 
sovereignty. 
With 

an increasingly dangerous and 
uncertain global landscape, the 
United States simply cannot afford 
to make more enemies.

While we will not be able 

to solve all of Cuba’s problems, 
severing ties has proven totally 
ineffective. After more than 50 
years of a failed strategy, it is time 
to employ a new policy. Continuing 
the progress we have already 
made gives us a greater chance of 
improving the lives of a people that 
have suffered long enough.

I 

think it was two years 
ago, 
when 
during 
the 

hard-fought 
University 

of 
Michigan-Ohio 
State 

University 
football 
game, 

I 
was 
so 
impressed 
with 

the care, concern and great 
sportsmanship 
demonstrated 

for all to see when the UM 
quarterback went over to OSU 
quarterback J.T. Barrett, knelt 
down to the field and offered 
a brief prayer to him where he 
lay when he was injured during 
the game. I wrote the Daily 
telling how proud I was of the 

Michigan player, and the Daily 
was kind enough to publish it.

Once again, as a resident 

of Columbus and a Buckeye 
fan (though I am a Purdue 
graduate), I feel that the tweets 
a number of your football 
team’s players sent to OSU with 
their prayers and concern for 
the University in light of the 
serious incident that happened 
yesterday is another example 
of Michigan class.

The game on Saturday was 

a spectacle to see, but we all 
know that the players on both 

sides of the game gave their 
all. Losing the game in such 
a way, after being so close to 
winning, has to have resulted in 
a sadness and frustration that 
will last for a long time. Even so, 
Michigan’s athletes put those 
personal 
feelings 
aside 
and 

publicly expressed their concern 
even after a bitter defeat. You 
can be very proud of these 
gentlemen,who exemplify the type 
of student-athlete all can admire.

Teen angst: not exclusive to teenagers.

What happens when a friend 

of yours goes missing? Do you 
file a police report, send out an 
Amber Alert or post a status 
about it on Facebook? Or do you 
actually 
go 
and 

seek out the person 
yourself?

These questions 

linger over TBS’s 
dark, hilarious new 
comedy 
“Search 

Party” — not to 
be confused with 
the atrocious 2014 
movie of the same 
name 
starring 

Thomas Middleditch. The TV 
show follows a group of four 
self-absorbed young adults who 
embark on a reluctant quest to 
find their missing college friend, 
Chantal Witherbottom (Clare 
McNulty, “High Maintenance”). 
Out of all of them, protagonist 
Dory (Alia Shawkat, “Arrested 
Development”) shows the most 
concern, despite having had only 
one interaction with Chantal 
back in school. As Dory and her 
pack of friends unearth more 
clues about Chantal, they learn 
a lot more about themselves and 
one another than they initially 
believed.

Led by a talented young 

cast 
who 
imbue 
the 
show 

with 
phenomenal 
comic 

performances, “Search Party” 
twists the existential dread 
of 
post-college 
ennui 
into 

a 
strange, 
intriguing 
and 

satisfying whodunit à la “Nancy 
Drew.” 
The 
show 
certainly 

appeals to millennials, in that 
its 
characters 
and 
dialogue 

reflect a lot of what millennials 
are like. But to classify it as a 
“show for millennials” is simply 
wrong. Like Comedy Central’s 
“Broad City,” its crass humor 
mirrors 
the 
dysfunctional 

antics of shows like “Seinfeld” 
and its missing-person mystery 
subplot is as compelling as an 
episode of “CSI.” It’s a show 
that, though somewhat familiar 
as a conventional comedy with 

an unconventional setup, feels 
wholly original on its own.

Thanks to the gifted craft of 

its creators — Sarah-Violet Bliss 
(“The Color of Time”), Charles 
Rogers 
(“Fort 
Tilden”) 
and 

Michael Showalter (“Wet Hot 
American Summer: The First 
Day of Camp”) — “Search Party” 

incorporates 
absurdism 
and 

surrealism, while 
still 
remaining 

grounded 
in 

reality. 
Shawkat 

is perfect as Dory, 
playing the role 
of the straight-
woman 
with 

assured 
finesse 

and a tinge of 

melancholy. 
Dory’s 
mission 

to find Chantal is the show’s 
main drive, but “Search Party” 
focuses on what this mission 
tells us about Dory as someone 
who is herself lost in a world that 
couldn’t care less about her.

She works in Brooklyn as 

an assistant to a rich socialite 
(Christine Taylor, “Dodgeball: 
A True Underdog Story”), where 
she’s given rudimentary tasks 
like throwing out unattractive, 
expensive clothes. Her love 
life also seems to be rather 
unexciting; Dory’s sensitive yet 
ineffectual boyfriend Drew (John 
Reynolds, “Stranger Things”) 
lacks both understanding of 
her boundary issues and the 
awareness to see the strains in 
their relationship. The two have 
a fight early on in the season, 
which turns out to be one of the 
funniest curse-laden outbursts 
on television in recent memory. 
Meanwhile, her two other best 
friends, the manipulative Elliott 
(John Early, “Other People”) 
and the naive extrovert Portia 
(Meredith Hagner, “Men at 
Work”), are too invested in their 
own shenanigans. Nevertheless, 
Dory does her best to drag along 
the three to help her look for 
Chantal, even though the real 
reason for finding Chantal lies 
within Dory’s own anxiety about 
making her life less mediocre.

“I think you’ve decided that 

this matters to you because 

you have nothing else,” Dory’s 
ex Julian (newcomer Brandon 
Micheal Hall) bluntly tells her 
when she asks for advice.

While 
“Search 
Party” 
is 

predominantly 
a 
plot-driven 

show, it also depicts these 
characters as three-dimensional, 
(somewhat) 
nuanced 
people. 

Dory’s sublimation over finding 
Chantal to satisfy her own 
needs is incredibly relatable to 
anyone who’s ever projected 
their anxiety onto other people’s 
lives. At first, Drew seems like 
a puzzled, immature asshole — 
which he is for the most part. But 
over the course of a few episodes, 
he’s seen as someone who deeply 
cares about Dory, even if he 
isn’t the best at showing it. On 
the other hand, Elliott is an 
attention-seeking 
narcissist, 

but unapologetically so, thanks 
to the likable charm of Early. 
The only character who needs 
a bit more work is Portia, who 
occasionally verges on the “dumb 
blonde” stereotype. Regardless 
of its flawed characters, the show 
is exemplary in demonstrating 
the power dynamics of modern 
friendship, as well as the search 
for truth in a society masked 
with lies and deceit.

Aesthetically, “Search Party” 

also brings a lot to the table with 
its enchanting cinematography 
and 
mesmerizing 
synthpop 

soundtrack — Purity Ring’s 
“Obedear” is the show’s theme 
song. Each episode title sounds 
like a chilling crime novel 
waiting to be read, such as “The 
Mysterious Disappearance of 
Chantal Witherbottom,” “The 
Woman Who Knew Too Much” 
and “The Night of One Thousand 
Candles.”

It’ll be interesting to see how 

“Search Party” will continue 
after its first season, which can be 
watched in its entirety on TBS’s 
online streaming platform. Will 
each subsequent season focus on 
a different mystery? Will Dory 
find the meaning in her life? Will 
Chantal join their group once 
she’s found? Like many mystery 
shows, “Search Party” is filled 
with questions, but fortunately it 
has all the right answers.

“Stardust” is a perfect movie. 

It’s perfect because it’s beautiful 
and 
sentimental 
and 
might 

be made of pure sunshine. Of 
course, it’s well edited and the 
characters are well-acted and 
it looks great and all of that 
technical stuff. But “Stardust” is 
perfect mostly because it’s just 
127 minutes of pure joy.

Let’s be clear: this assessment 

of “Stardust” is perhaps the least 
objective possible opinion on the 
movie you’re likely to ever find. 
“Stardust” and I have a history. 
I saw it for the first time at the 
age of seven, having just finished 
devouring the “Harry Potter” 
and “Narnia” series and I was 
desperate for more fantasy and 
otherworldly adventures. I was 
transfixed instantly, and have 
rewatched the movie once a year 
since.

Based on the book of the 

same name by Neil Gaiman, 
“Stardust” tells the tale of 
Tristan Thorn in his quest for 
true love. Tristan, played by 
Charlie Cox (“Daredevil”), is a 
bumbling and sweet shop boy 
living in an English village 
called Wall, named for the long 
wall on its border that no one 
is allowed to cross. Tristan is 
in love with Victoria (Sienna 
Miller, “American Sniper”), and 
when he sees a shooting star 
one night, he promises to cross 
the wall and bring Victoria back 
the star to prove his devotion to 
her. However, crossing the wall 
isn’t as simple as it seems. The 
wall is a bridge to another world, 
a kingdom called Stormhold, 
where the seven sons of the 
dying king are on a hunt for a 
ruby necklace that will allow 

them to ascend the throne. 
Tristan does indeed find the 
shooting star, only to find that 
it’s no lump of rock at all, but 
instead takes the form of a young 
woman named Yvaine (Claire 
Danes, “Homeland”). Yvaine is 
in grave danger, because a coven 
of witches are chasing after her 
to cut out her heart and eat it to 
restore their youth and beauty. 
If it seems complicated, don’t 
worry, that’s only about half the 
story. I haven’t even gotten to 

the pirates in feather boas or the 
Greek chorus of ghost princes.

You’d be hard-pressed to find a 

movie that better blends comedy, 
action and romance in a way 
that serves all three sentiments 
equally well. For one thing, the 
comedy is genuinely funny and 
the action is truly exciting. Action 
comedies so often do away with 
real emotion because it’s much 
easier to turn them into cynical 
parody. 
Take 
“The 
Princess 

Bride” as an example. Now, I love 
“The Princess Bride,” and don’t 
know anyone of sound mind and 
body who doesn’t, but nobody 
watches “The Princess Bride” 
for its gentle sentimentality and 
precisely expressed emotions. 
It’s just not that kind of movie. 
“Stardust,” on the other hand, 
somehow manages to convey real 
romance and emotional stakes 
while still being honestly funny.

But that’s not what hooked 

me on this movie as a little kid 
— little kids don’t care about 
balanced tones or any nonsense 
like that. No, what got me was 
the intangible, yet ever present 
magical quality to “Stardust” 
that is reinforced by every aspect 
of the film: the costumes, the 
acting, even the name. “Stardust” 
makes anything seem possible — 
it makes you feel like a little kid 
again. It’s all imagination and 
hope, no wise remarks or dark 
cynicism.

“Stardust” was directed by 

Matthew Vaughn, the director of 
“Kick-Ass” and “Kingsman: The 
Secret Service.” Both of these 
films are pitch-black comedies 
that rely heavily on brutal 
violence and the crudest of 
humor to drive their stories. So 
“Stardust” is a bit of an anomaly 
in Vaughn’s filmography, what 
with its profanity-free script and 
its “127 minutes of pure joy” thing 
it has got going on. Knowing that 
it’s made by Matthew Vaughn, it 
would be easy for a cynic to write 
“Stardust” off as a parody that 
just didn’t do its job very well.

But “Stardust” has little time 

for cynicism. And besides, the 
cynic’s view is probably the 
easiest and least interesting 
way of thinking about this 
story. Turning your nose down 
is easy. Thinking earnestly and 
hopefully is harder — so much 
harder, in fact, that it almost 
never happens once we reach 
a certain age. That’s why we 
need movies like “Stardust” 
to remind us every once in a 
while that it doesn’t have to 
be this way — that under the 
world’s dark, sardonic, derisive 
pessimism lies an awful, earnest 
belief that things could be good. 
That maybe, just maybe, we 
could even believe in magic.

“This is for my number one fan, Caroline Filips.”

Abel Tesfaye has developed 

quite the persona since 2012’s 
Trilogy. His smooth, high voice 
now rings out tales of sex and 

drug use, enveloping the explicit 
material in a fog of irresistible 
soul and Tesfaye has grown to 
great acclaim since that quiet 
2012 release. He’s now warmly 
welcomed as The Weeknd on 
radio stations, the main stages 
of music festivals and in front of 

a sea of celebrities at events like 
the Grammys. The Weeknd’s 
latest 
work, 
the 
mammoth 

18-track Starboy, confronts his 
current status — standing at 
the crossroads of purposeful 
musicality and pop-stardom.

Starboy opens with its lead 

CARLY SNIDER
Daily Arts Writer

The Weeknd breaks free from his 
popstar mold with new ‘Starboy’

The album also features Kendrick Lamar, Daft Punk and Future

single and title track, “Starboy,” 
playing right into the hands 
of eager disc jockeys across 
the country. Following in the 
footsteps of “Can’t 
Feel 
My 
Face,” 

the track draws 
on 
Daft 
Punk’s 

funk 
and 
relies 

on 
formulaic 

pop 
repetition 

and 
seemingly 

nonsensical lyrics. 
Though not The 
Weeknd’s 
most 

profound effort, “Starboy” gets 
the record off to a strong start.

The album goes on to deliver 

some of the same expected party 
tracks. “Rockin” is a solid track 
that prods listeners to, well, 
rock. It’s bouncy and addictive 
— the kind of song that will 
likely be played to a pulp on the 
radio in a few months time. The 
aptly named “Party Monster” 
brings to mind images of a blue-
lit nightclub full of dancing 
bodies as the chorus repeats, 
“Woke up by a girl, I don’t even 
know her name.”

Pleasure 
seeking 
aside, 

there are a few tracks that, 
surprisingly, give listeners a 
glimpse into The Weeknd’s life 
when he’s not bedding women 
or getting high. In what feels 
like flashes of consciousness, 
the lyrics comment on The 
Weeknd’s 
upbringing, 
his 

previous 
work 
and 
today’s 

current celebrity climate. In 

“Reminder,” he takes a dig at the 
commodification and celebrity 
of his own work, singing “I just 
won a new award for a kids show 

/ Talking ‘bout a 
face numbing off 
a bag of blow.” The 
track also takes 
swaggering 
hits 

at other R&B-ers 
trying and failing 
to 
mimic 
his 

Trilogy sound.

The 
Weeknd 

goes on to address 

his upbringing and its stark 
contrast to the lavish life he 
now leads. On “Sidewalks,” 
he alludes to hardships in 
his youth and his struggle to 
make something of himself. 
Although still functioning on 
the surface level, the Kendrick 
Lamar feature on “Sidewalks” 
makes 
it 
one 
of 
Starboy’s 

most socially aware tracks. 
Similarly, “Six Feet Under” 
deals with the pressures of 
consumerism 
and 
attempts 

to shed light on the problems 
that can come with material 
obsession. Unfortunately, the 
track goes about doing so in 
a way that revolves around 
the objectification of female 
bodies.

On 
“Ordinary 
Life” 
The 

Weeknd 
acknowledges 
the 

absurdity 
of 
his 
lifestyle 

outright. The chorus consists 
only of a repeated, “This ain’t 
ordinary life.” He knows that 

his music and the life it depicts 
act as an outlet, a fantasy for 
those who tune in. He even goes 
as far as to insinuate that his 
life will end early and he will 
find himself in Hell. But The 
Weeknd’s reminder that his 
existence isn’t perfect or readily 
attainable is still packaged in 
a 
romanticized, 
intoxicating 

track — he’s not trying too hard 
to turn anyone away. 

The record is bookended by 

Daft Punk features, wrapping 
with 
“I 
Feel 
It 
Coming.” 

The track is soft and kind in 
comparison to The Weeknd’s 
usual depictions of physical 
intimacy. There is no rush or 
urgency in his voice, no crude 
anatomical 
euphemisms. 
It 

shows 
the 
growth 
of 
The 

Weeknd 
as 
an 
artist 
and, 

arguably, as a man since Trilogy 
hit the Internet four years ago.

Starboy’s range — musically, 

lyrically and vocally — is a clear 
attempt by The Weeknd to shake 
free from his increasingly pop-
heavy mold. Even the length of 
the album itself may be taken as 
an affront on pop convention. 
But The Weeknd is not making 
any overt statements; the tracks 
largely follow the pop formula 
and the album runs smoothly 
from start to finish. Though there 
are clear markers of attempted 
dissonance, Starboy is ultimately 
a well-produced, radio-friendly 
record that will please current 
fans and draw in even more.

TV REVIEW

Nostalgia is a funny thing. 

It brings us happiness, while 
remaining elusive as to how to 
recapture it and 
also 
leaving 
us 

unsure how to feel. 
This 
sentiment 

best 
describes 

the long awaited 
“Gilmore 
Girls” 

revival “A Year in 
the Life.” The new 
series may leave 
fans 
struggling 

to reconcile the 
beloved 
Stars 

Hollow and characters they knew 
from over a decade ago with the 
world presented to them now. 
Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino 
(“Bunheads”) similarly seems to 
struggle bridging the gap between 
the show she left after its sixth 
season with the chance she has to 
revisit it now.

The four-part series loosely 

follows a four act structure, each 
set in a different season of the 
year. The slightly overwrought 
“seasons” metaphor attempts to 
hint at any sort of development in 
the show’s characters throughout 
the four episodes, but doesn’t lend 
much to the series overall. While 
the comforting sight of a snowy 
Stars Hollow and the resurrection 
of the “Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of 
Summer” town festival ignite the 
seasonal settings with a rewarding 
familiarity, the plot itself remains 
mostly disconnected from the 
thematic titles.

Faint efforts are made at 

reminding us that time has passed 
since we last saw Lorelai (Lauren 
Graham, “Parenthood”) and Rory 
(Alexis Bledel, “The Sisterhood of 
the Traveling Pants”). And while 
some are successful, many point 
glaringly to the fact that Sherman-
Palladino wants to pick up where 
she left off before leaving the 
show (and taking her vision for 
the show’s ending with her). The 
title of “Winter” fades in over 
lines of dialogue from seasons 
past, introducing the series with 
an eerie feeling that enhances the 

uncertainty of what’s to come.

But this eeriness dissipates as 

soon as we’re dropped back into 
the cozy town of Stars Hollow with 
Rory and Lorelai’s casual reunion 
— one that indicates their lives 
continued on after the “Gilmore 

Girls” 
finale 
and 

we’re 
just 
now 

catching 
up 
with 

them as one would 
with 
old 
friends. 

Sherman-Palladino 
acknowledges 
the 
potential 

awkwardness 
of 

our first encounter 
with 
these 

characters after so 
long 
with 
subtle 

self-awareness. After their first 
round 
of 
Sherman-Palladino’s 

special 
brand 
of 
quick-fire 

banter, Rory exclaims “I’m out 
of breath,” and Lorelai responds 
“It’s been awhile since we’ve 
done that.” This tongue-in-cheek 
acknowledgement of the show’s 
return likely made fans’ hearts 
skip a beat with the layered 
emotion behind the exchange. 
Other continuities like Kirk’s 
(Sean Gunn, “Super”) half-witted 
entrepreneurial endeavors and 
Taylor’s (Michael Winters, “Deep 
Impact”) endless campaigning 
to modify the town are a treat. 
Moments like these make the 
revival worth watching, but at a 
cost. 

At times, Sherman-Palladino 

and her husband Daniel Palladino 
(who each wrote two episodes, 
respectively) seem like they’re 
trying to fit far too much into the 
narrative. The four-part series 
plays out like a movie in which 
the plot moves along restlessly 
towards the culmination of its 
efforts in the very end. Storylines 
that don’t match the tone of the 
series are introduced with little 
explanation — a likely result of 
attempts to include old characters 
like Paris (Liza Weil, “How to Get 
Away With Murder”) and Logan 
(Matt Czuchry, “The Good Wife”) 
for our benefit.

Lorelai’s arc suffers the most 

from these atypical plot points — 
her insistence on wanting a baby 
then venturing out to California 

to emulate the story from “Wild” 
forces conflict between her and 
the seemingly idle Luke (Scott 
Patterson, “Meth Head”) It also 
distracts from the significance 
of the more successful subplots, 
including her mother Emily (Kelly 
Bishop, “Bunheads”) and her 
relationship with Rory. Rory’s arc 
flounders under similar twists 
and turns, most of which are self-
inflicted obstacles that make it 
difficult to sympathize with Rory 
as she navigates her nomadic 
lifestyle and career with the self-
doubt of a troubled 30-something.

However, some of the storylines 

introduced succeed with their 
unexpected novelty. And above 
all, the relationship between the 
three Gilmore women surpasses 
the sum of their parts. With 
the passing of actor Edward 
Herrmann (“The Practice”) who 
played the imposing Richard 
Gilmore, 
Sherman-Palladino 

poignantly weaves together both 
genuine emotion and comic relief 
that is reminiscent of the original 
series’ ability to bring together 
conflict and comedy with pathos 
and charm.

Overall, the revival somewhat 

resembles the oversized portrait 
of Richard commissioned by 
Emily that sits in the Gilmore 
living room. Emily refuses to 
acknowledge that it’s oversized, 
too 
overcome 
by 
her 
grief 

over Richard’s death to admit 
that his depiction is not what 
she had intended it to be. 
The looming presence of the 
portrait captures his likeness 
and essence, but doesn’t quite fit 
with its surroundings. In short, 
it represents something held 
dear by many but that can’t be 
recaptured in the appropriate 
way. The revival series is just that 
— a too-large-for-life replication 
of what was once great at odds 
with the new circumstances 
under which it was created.

Despite its flaws, the series 

revisits 
its 
characters 
with 

integrity and harkens back to 
a world where rapid dialogue 
chock-full 
of 
pop 
culture 

references is the norm, while 
creating a sense of closure for 
fans to hold on to.

Those bottom eyelashes, though. 

We arrived to the Fillmore 

in Detroit almost five hours 
before 
doors 
opened 
for 

Marina and the Diamonds, 
waiting 
in 
anticipation 
to 

witness the spectacle of a 
true pop goddess. Her music 
embodies fierce femininity; 
with songs like “Primadonna 
Girl” and “Bubblegum Bitch,” 
it’s pretty hard not to.

As an avid fan of music 

and concert-going, I’ve never 
bothered 
to 
pay 
attention 

to my own appearance at 
shows or what others could 
possibly think of my own 
music preferences. I donned 
my finest pop-punk kid attire 
for the summer show: black 
Vans, khaki shorts, Knuckle 
Puck shirt and my classic black 
nose ring — an outfit I could 
have easily worn to Warped 
Tour (and probably did). In 
retrospect, a punk kid singing 
lyrics like “I’m gonna pop 
your bubblegum hard” at a 
Marina show must have been 
an abnormal sight. But who 
actually gives a shit?

Music 
transcends 
things 

as 
trivial 
as 
aesthetics, 

masculinity and femininity. It 
resounds in the soul. In today’s 
world, gender expectations for 
music should be about as dead 
as the binary gender system. 
It’s 
an 
outdated, 
limiting 

ideology to execute on a daily 
basis.

Unfortunately, 
this 

isn’t quite the case. I still 
shamelessly jam to Pierce The 
Veil, whose flawless blend of 
incredible 
guitar 
melodies, 

post-hardcore breakdowns and 
poetic lyrics are egregiously 
underappreciated by masses 
of male adults. To this day, I 
receive comments like “His 
voice is too girly” or “They’re 
for 
13-year-old 
girls” 
in 

response to my love of the 
band (don’t get me wrong, this 
is definitely a shot at all of my 
friends from high school). It’s 
an isolated incident of frankly 
ridiculous standards for music 
taste that spread throughout 
the spectrum of genres.

It’s 
also 
disgustingly 

common to see the belittling 
of women in the punk scene. 
Girls aren’t “strong enough” to 
protect themselves in a punk 
crowd, or they’re just being 
“fangirls.” I take it as a damn 
compliment 
when 
someone 

likens me to a fangirl — if the 

best you can do is compare my 
passions to a stereotype, at the 
very least it’s getting noticed.

I guess the whole point of 

this discussion is to dismantle 
the reasons people tend to 
view music through such a 
limiting lens. There’s a number 
of possibilities ranging from 
fragile 
masculinity 
to 
an 

overall lack of appreciation 
for music as something more 
than background noise. This 
is at no blame to the person, 
but I think it would be pretty 
hard for someone who’s had 
“Closer” by the Chainsmokers 
on repeat for the past few 
months to dig anything from 
Pierce The Veil. Still, I think 
it’s important to critique music 
by how it hits you, not whether 
you perceive it as masculine or 
feminine. It’s unnecessary to 
gender music and unnecessary 
to cut your scope of interest 
short in response to socially 
constructed ideas.

It’s about time we destroy 

these expectations, not only in 
music but also in the continual 
destruction of barriers around 
human existence: listen to what 
you want, wear what you want 
and be exactly who you want. 
Nothing is stopping you other 
than your own insecurities.

DOMINIC POLSINELLI

It’s time to end overt expectations 
around gender in the music world

Marina and the Diamonds concert open to Primadonna Boys , too

“Paranoid,” an ITV show 

now available on Netflix, opens 
like an episode of “House,” 
“Bones” or “Law and Order.” It 
begins with an 
idyllic scene in 
a 
playground; 

children 
are 

playing 
in 

the 
sandbox, 

parents 
are 

laughing 
and 

one 
woman 

is 
sitting 
on 

a park bench 
alone, 
blonde 

tendrils of hair gently blowing 
in the wind, watching a mother 
push her toddler on a swing. A 
man enters the frame, wearing 
a sweatshirt pulled close over 
his hunched shoulders, his 
face hidden by the hood. The 
air seems to stiffen as he walks 
towards the mother, hands in 
his pockets. Before anyone can 
predict his actions, he grabs 
her and stabs her several times. 
The woman sitting on the park 
bench runs forward and pulls 
the child out of the swing to 
protect him, but the man runs 
away after leaving his victim 
lying in a pool of blood under 
the swings. Opening credits 
roll.

However, unlike “House,” 

“Bones” or “Law and Order: 
SVU,” the pilot of “Paranoid” is 
awful enough to merit refusing 
it a second chance. It’s boring, 
kitschy and full of cliches that 
aren’t even executed well. It’s 
overly filtered, and the score 
matches the overdone aesthetic.

The plot follows a group of 

detectives who try to solve the 
whodunit, but they quickly 
realize it is not as simple as they 

thought it would be. There’s 
a schizophrenic suspect with 
OCD who is later found dead 
himself, framed as a murder-
suicide situation. The detectives 
receive anonymous notes in 
boxes with photographs that 
say things like “You have no 

idea 
what 
you’re 

up 
against” 
and 

“Look into Angela’s 
past.” 
To 
quote 

Miranda 
Priestly: 

groundbreaking.

The worst part of 

“Paranoid,” besides 
the 
hackneyed 

plot and the score, 
is the writing for 
the 
three 
main 

detectives, 
The 
first 
is 
a 

grizzled old cop, Bobby Day 
(Robert Glenister, “Hustle”) 
who 
questions 
the 
blonde 

woman, Lucy (Lesley Sharp, 
“The Full Monty”) with his 
hands shaking slightly as he 
tries to write down her answers. 
She looks at him without 
blinking a second longer than is 
comfortable, smiles beatifically 
and then offers advice on how 
to deal with panic attacks. He 
cuts her down immediately, 
embarrassed 
that 
she’s 

spotted his weakness. Lucy 
blinks and moves on. (I seem 
to remember seeing a lot of 
pointed blinking in the pilot. 
Whether they were attempting 
to make a point about non-
verbal communication or I was 
just bored enough to be paying 
special attention to eyelids is up 
for debate.)

Lucy is constantly wearing 

soft smiles to indicate that she 
always knows what’s best for 
people. I’m still rather confused 
as to her role in the plot.

Indira Varma (“Game of 

Thrones”) plays Nina, the 
second main detective, and is 

blessed with the opportunity 
to deliver this line: “I’m 38 
years old. I’m childless. My 
arse is starting to sag. And 
the flake that I thought was 
going to marry me has given 
me the shove.” It was bizarrely 
reminiscent of “Bridget Jones’s 
Diary” which made me upset 
that I was watching this and 
not “Bridget Jones’s Diary.”

Later on, after mulling over 

how said flake (her boyfriend 
of a few years) had dumped her 
in front of the third detective 
(Dino Fetscher, “Now You See 
Me 2”), Nina mutters “Why 
am I so buttoned up,” and then 
kisses him. The second they 
break apart and he opens his 
mouth, perhaps to say “Where 
did that trite piece of dialogue 
come from?” she shakes her 
head and tells him to forget 
it. Fetscher’s confused face 
never changes throughout the 
episode.

Most of the pilot is taken up 

by trying to track down people 
who are connected with the 
victim’s past. It ends with a 
possible key suspect’s body 
facedown in a swimming pool, 
and 
another 
box 
delivered 

to Bobby. Inside is a DVD 
of footage of himself and 
another photograph — this 
one edgily scribbled on with 
black Sharpie — and a sinister 
message. This would’ve been 
an interesting way to end the 
pilot and convince someone to 
watch the next episode if that 
someone hadn’t seen the same 
cliffhanger in several other 
episodes of several other TV 
shows. The pilot ends after 
40-something 
minutes 
of 

failing to make you care about 
any of the characters. The only 
good thing I got out of it was 
a reminder to watch “Bridget 
Jones’s Diary” again.

Wolverines’ fate up in the air

After the Michigan football 

team lost in double overtime to 
No. 2 Ohio State on Saturday, 
redshirt sophomore quarterback 
Wilton Speight speculated that 
the Wolverines’ chances to make 
the College Football Playoff were 
“slim to none.”

Three days later, it’s not clear 

whether he’s correct or not, but 
one thing is for sure: Michigan 
will need help.

The Wolverines slotted in 

at No. 5 in the second-to-last 
CFP rankings revealed Tuesday 
night, behind No. 1 Alabama, 
No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Clemson 
and No. 4 Washington — all of 
which, with the exception of the 
undefeated Crimson Tide, have 
only one loss on their résumés.

Michigan 
stands 
as 
the 

highest-ranked 
two-loss 

team in the country and has 
head-to-head wins over No. 6 
Wisconsin, No. 7 Penn State 
and No. 8 Colorado.

Many 
pundits 
believe 

Alabama and Ohio State are locks 
for the playoff, meaning that the 
Wolverines would need Clemson 
or Washington to lose their 

conference championship games 
to get back in the playoff picture.

What complicates matters, 

though, is that the Badgers 
and Nittany Lions will meet 
for the Big Ten Championship 
on Saturday, thanks to Penn 
State’s 
division-tiebreaking 

win over Ohio State. And 
the 
eighth-ranked 
Buffaloes 

have an opportunity to upend 
Washington and add the Pac-12 
Championship to their résumé.

Consequently, 
Michigan 

may be the most divisive team 
still in contention. Even ESPN’s 
panelists squabbled over the 
Wolverines during the release 
show Tuesday night, delving into 
the arguments for and against 
Michigan making the playoff.

Host Rece Davis pointed to the 

Wolverines’ weak road schedule, 
mentioning that they only beat 
2-10 Rutgers and 3-9 Michigan 
State, while losing to Iowa and 
Ohio State.

Analyst 
Joey 
Galloway 

preached the importance of 
conference 
championships, 

citing 
the 
final 
2014 
CFP 

rankings, in which TCU fell from 
No. 3 to No. 6 after the Buckeyes 
won the Big Ten Championship. 
He 
also 
pointed 
out 
the 

unprecedented 
possibility 
of 

two non-conference champions 
from the same division making 
the playoff.

“If Penn State wins the East 

and wins the Big Ten, and you, 
say, ‘Great job, great season, let’s 
go back and get two teams from 
the East and put them in,’ now 
we’re talking crazy,” he said.

On the other side of the 

argument, 
Kirk 
Herbstreit, 

who did color commentary 
for the Wolverines’ game in 
Columbus, raised the question 
of “most deserving” versus 
“best.” In Herbstreit’s opinion, 
Michigan’s 
performance 

against the Buckeyes — and its 
three head-to-head wins over 
fellow contenders — proved 
the Wolverines were one of the 
top teams and that they should 
advance to the playoff with a 
Washington loss Friday.

Of 
course, 
none 
of 
the 

panelists’ opinions factor into the 
decision. And the chairman of the 
CFP selection committee, Kirby 
Hocutt, emphasized that the 
ultimate goal of the committee is 
to get the “four very best teams” 
into the playoff, regardless of 
conference championships and 
past years’ precedents.

This 
week, 
Hocutt 
said 

Washington and Michigan had a 
very small margin of separation. 
Things could only get more 
difficult next week as Clemson, 
Washington, 
Michigan 
and 

Colorado, as well as either 
Wisconsin or Penn State, could 
all have two losses, bringing up 
the difficult question of how to 
separate them.

“When 
two 
teams 
are 

comparable, there’s razor-thin 
margins between the two, that’s 
when we go to the protocol and the 
metrics,” Hocutt said on ESPN. 
“Conference 
championships, 

strength of schedules, head-
to-head, and outcomes against 
common opponents.

“Those four are not in any 

particular order. None of those 
four are weighted above the 
other. It’s up to each member 
of the selection committee to 
determine if there’s a priority 
of one of those four metrics to 
them and which one carries the 
most weight.”

At the end of the day, he 

reiterated, the committee’s job is 
to find the four best teams based 
on overall résumés.

What that means for the 

Wolverines is anyone’s guess.

‘M’ hosts Hokies in Big Ten/ACC Challenge

With games such as No. 

3 North Carolina vs. No. 10 
Indiana, 
No. 
14 
Louisville 

vs. 
No. 
16 

Purdue, 
No. 

17 Wisconsin 
vs. 
No. 
22 

Syracuse 
all 
on 
the 

schedule; the 
Big Ten/ACC 
Challenge 
has 
its 
fair 

share 
of 

heavyweight 
bouts.

But another 

big game in 
the Challenge 
will 
take 

place inside Crisler Center 
Wednesday night between the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

team and Virginia Tech (5-1).

Both teams, who were on 

opposite sides of the bubble last 
season, with Michigan making 
the NCAA Tournament and the 
Hokies going to the NIT, come 
into the game with bounce-
back wins. The Wolverines 
(5-1) beat Mount St. Mary’s 
on Saturday after losing to 
South Carolina, and the Hokies 
downed Nebraska on Sunday 
after losing to Texas A&M.

“We got a quality game on 

our hands,” said Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beilein. 
“It’s 

really odd that the bubble 
teams (from last year) that 
have (players) back are the 
teams we’re playing, whether 
it’s South Carolina, UCLA, 
Marquette and now Virginia 
Tech.”

After a lackluster loss in 

Columbia, S.C., where they shot 
just 19.2 percent and made only 
1 of 25 from behind the arc, the 
Wolverines bounced back to 

defeat the Mountaineers, 64-47.

Led by the trio of senior 

guard 
Derrick 
Walton 
Jr., 

senior forward Zak Irvin and 
sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner, who all put up double-
digit point totals, the Wolverines 
powered their way past Mount 
St. Mary’s for the victory.

“We knew we just had to 

bounce back (from the loss to 
South Carolina),” Irvin said. 
“Every team goes through 
those games where the ball 
doesn’t fall for you. The game 
doesn’t go your way, and I 
knew I had to come with a 
mindset to be able to bounce 
back, and I think the team did 
that as well.”

Michigan 
shot 
much 

better against a much smaller 
opponent in the Mountaineers 
and regained some of its stroke 
that allowed it to shoot its way 
past Marquette and Southern 
Methodist prior to its loss to 
the Gamecocks.

On the other side of the 

court, Virginia Tech, which 
was projected to finish 10th in 
the Atlantic Coast Conference 
this season, has impressed 
early on in the season. The 
Hokies started the year with 
four straight victories before 
a narrow three-point loss to 
Texas A&M at 
the 
Wooden 

Classic 
in 

Fullerton, Calif.

Coach Buzz 

Williams’ team 
is led by 6-foot-
7 forward Zach 
LeDay, 
who 

ranks first on 
the 
team 
in 

both 
points 

and rebounds, 
averaging 16.3 and 7.7 per 
game, respectively.

Virginia 
Tech’s 
biggest 

strength has been its shooting 

and its transition offense. The 
Hokies are shooting at almost 
50 percent this season and 
play an up-tempo style that 

Michigan 
has 

not 
had 
to 

defend yet this 
season.

“They’re 
a 

really 
smart 

team,” Beilein 
said. 
“They 

shoot the ball 
really 
well. 

They 
remind 

me 
of 
some 

of the better 

teams we’ve had, who have a 
lot of shooters and have a lot of 
guys who can see the floor.

“That ball is going to come 

through the basket and pushed 
up the floor right down our 
throat. So if our transition 
defense isn’t good enough, they 
will get 80 on us.”

While Virginia Tech’s style 

of offense is something that the 
Wolverines haven’t yet seen 
this season, it is one that they 
will see down the road.

Beilein 
highlighted 

Michigan State and Indiana 
as teams that play with an 
up-tempo style that Michigan 
will see later on in the season.

So while the Hokies may not 

have the talent of the Spartans 
or the Hoosiers, Virginia Tech 
will pose a good challenge for 
Michigan before tougher Big 
Ten foes come to town.

FOOTBALL
Peppers, 
defense 
dominate 
awards

The 
Michigan 
football 

team’s defense dominated its 
opponents all year long. Tuesday 
night, it dominated the Big Ten’s 
award show.

All 11 of Michigan’s defensive 

starters received honors from the 
Big Ten, with eight making either 
first or second team All-Big Ten and 
three earning honorable mentions.

Jabrill 
Peppers 
was 
the 

big winner, taking home the 
Nagurski-Woodson 
Defensive 

Player of of the Year, Butkus-
Fitzgerald 
Linebacker 
of 
the 

Year and Rodgers-Dwight return 
specialist of the year awards. In 
fact, only one of the four individual 
defensive awards not given to 
Michigan — the conference’s 
Smith-Brown Defensive Lineman 
of the Year award was given to 
Ohio State’s Tyquan Lewis.

Peppers was the first player 

to win three awards since the 
conference expanded its awards 
program in 2011.

Peppers, who is in the running 

to be a Heisman Trophy finalist, 
tallied 16 tackles for loss in 
the regular season and had 
one interception. He made an 
impact all over the field, lining 
up 
defensively 
at 
linebacker, 

safety and cornerback, as well as 
playing offense and serving as the 
Wolverines’ main return man.

A redshirt sophomore, Peppers 

is just the fourth Michigan player 
to win Defensive Player of the 
Year, following Charles Woodson 
(who also won the Heisman in 
1997), Larry Foote (2001) and 
LaMarr Woodley (2006).

He was also one of four 

Wolverines named first team 
All-Conference 
on 
defense, 

along with senior defensive end 
Taco Charlton, fifth-year senior 
defensive end Chris Wormley 
(coaches) and senior cornerback 
Jourdan Lewis.

Lewis took home the Tatum-

Woodson Defensive Back of the 
Year award, capping a season in 
which he took away half the field 
for the Wolverines. Even with 
teams seldom throwing his way, 
Lewis broke up 12 passes and 
intercepted two. He allowed just 
eight receptions all season.

His biggest highlight-reel play 

came on a fourth-down deep ball 
against Wisconsin, when Lewis 
made an outstretched, one-handed 
grab to ice the game. Lewis was the 
anchor of the nation’s No. 1 pass 
defense, a distinction reflected 
in the vast number of Wolverines 
honored Tuesday during the Big 
Ten Network’s hour-long award 
special.

Fifth-year 
senior 
defensive 

tackle 
Ryan 
Glasgow, 
senior 

cornerback Channing Stribling, 
senior 
safety 
Delano 
Hill 

(coaches) and senior linebacker 
Ben Gedeon (media) were named 
to the second team.

Earning honorable mentions 

were fifth-year senior defensive 
tackle 
Matt 
Godin 
(coaches), 

redshirt 
junior 
linebacker 

Mike McCray and senior safety 
Dymonte Thomas.

Fifth-year senior Kenny Allen 

was the second team All-Big Ten 
punter and an honorable mention 
at kicker.

The Coach of the Year awards 

were split between Wisconsin’s 
Paul Chryst (coaches) and Penn 
State’s James Franklin (media), 
the two coaches who will compete 
for the Big Ten title in Indianapolis 
this Saturday.

All 11 defensive 
players earn All-
Big Ten accolades

Michigan defenseman Cutler Martin (left) takes naps to make sure he’s rested on the road, while goaltender Zach Nagelvoort (right) prefers to stay awake and loose.
Inside the Wolverines’ road trips

Road trips with the No. 20 

Michigan hockey team consist 
of visits to new arenas, games 
against former teammates and 
simply “being on the road with 
the boys.”

Senior 
goaltender 
Zach 

Nagelvoort remembers many 
moments throughout his history 
of road trips and roommates 
with the Wolverines. His most 
memorable 
moment, 
though, 

occurred when he roomed with 
former 
Michigan 
goaltender 

and then-senior Adam Janecyk 
during 
the 
2013-14 
season. 

Nagelvoort saw Janecyk as a 
role model, especially as the 
two shared Western Michigan 
roots, with Janecyk hailing from 
Grand Rapids and Nagelvoort 
from Holland.

“I don’t remember where 

we were (on the road) … and 
I didn’t know him super well, 
and I had statistics homework,” 
Nagelvoort said Monday. “And 
so I’m trying to do it, and I’m 
buried in it. I just could not 
understand it, so I brought him 
over. I’m expecting that (since) 
he’s a senior, he’ll give me some 
pointers. Well, he just kinda 
looked at it, and he says ‘Dude, 
this might as well be Chinese.’ ”

Though Janecyk couldn’t help 

Nagelvoort with his homework 
assignment, he grew as a role 
model 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ 

system. Every road trip, all of 
the team’s roommate pairings 
consist of one upperclassman 
and one underclassman. The 
older player ensures that his 
younger counterpart remains 
focused during the trip and 
arrives promptly for mealtime 
and the pre-game skate.

Junior 
forward 
Cutler 

Martin roomed with sophomore 
defenseman Joseph Cecconi last 
season and now splits time on the 
road with Cecconi and freshman 
forward Steven Merl. Last year, 
Martin and Cecconi bonded over 
their shared nap schedule.

“Every guy likes to nap 

different 
amounts,” 
Martin 

said. “Some guys like to go a 
couple of hours, some guys like 
to go 30 minutes. Chico and I 
like to lie down for an hour and 
a half, at least, to get ready for 
the game and make sure we 
get 
ready 
to 

go. 
(There’s) 

not too much 
laughing when 
we wake up and 
walk down to 
the bus to go to 
the games.”

As 

goaltenders, 
Nagelvoort and 
his 
roommate, 

freshman 
Hayden 
Lavigne, their perspective is 
slightly different from the rest 
of the team.

“Whichever 
guy 
is 
not 

starting, (he’s) going to do 
pretty much whatever it is to 
make that guy (who’s starting) 
comfortable,” Nagelvoort said. 
“So if he likes to nap for three 
and a half hours, then you’re 
quiet for three and a half hours. 
If he only likes 30 minutes of 
napping and wants to talk for 
a little while, or keep it light. 
(Lavigne) did that for me in 
Arizona. When he’s playing, I’m 
sure it’ll be the exact opposite.”

Added freshman goaltender 

Jack 
LaFontaine: 
“Everyone 

has their own superstitions 
and stuff, and so everyone has 

a little bit of respect. You know 
not to talk to a certain guy, don’t 
wake him up at this specific 
time. Lavigne’s not the weirdest 
goalie (I’ve roomed with). He’s 
not going to be doing weird stuff 
at 4 a.m. I’ve had some pretty 
weird roommates in this past, so 
it’s a breath of a fresh air to room 
with these guys.”

For 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson, his decision to pair 
roommates in this way stems 
from his days as a player at 
Michigan. 
He 
remembers 

rooming with older teammates 

as 
a 
young 

player 
and 

likewise 
tried 

to pass on the 
knowledge 
he 

gained when he 
was a senior.

And 
these 

roommate 
pairings could 
lead to on-ice 
success as well.

“It helps (to) 

get 
to 
know 

each other as people,” Berenson 
said. “There’s no question. And 
you have a good relationship 
with them, you can communicate 
better with them, you can critique 
each other better and you can be 
closer together as a unit on the 
ice. We’ve got 11 freshmen on our 
team. We need the upperclassmen 
to appreciate what kind of people 
these guys are. They’re not just 
hockey players, they’re not just 
freshmen, they’re good people. 
And I think the more you can 
respect someone as a person, the 
more you get to know them, the 
more you’ll appreciate them on 
the ice, too.”

As the players can attest, 

though, success isn’t only about 
the on-ice chemistry.

“Road trips are so weird 

because you’re together but you 
spend a ton of time just in your 
hotel room,” Nagelvoort said. 
“There is a lot of downtime. 
Hayden’s 
a 
studious 
guy, 

probably more studious than 
I’ve ever been.

“If we’re not hanging out and 

talking or watching movies, 
then he’s buried in a book or 
something like that. He’s been 
a good guy to room with. The 
focus is on keeping it light with 
the two of us.”

Lavigne 
and 
Nagelvoort’s 

chemistry 
shows 
Berenson’s 

success 
in 
creating 
these 

roommate 
pairings. 
Often, 

Berenson will find a team leader 
and place an anxious freshman 
with him. After a few weeks, as 
the young player becomes more 
comfortable, he will give the 
senior another mentee. On last 
year’s team, JT Compher served 
in this mentor position. This 
season, it is senior defenseman 
and captain Nolan de Jong, who, 
according to Berenson, “walks 
the talk” on and off the ice.

As the Wolverines prepare 

to travel to State College to 
face No. 7 Penn State, the elder 
players 
will 
ensure 
prompt 

practice 
attendance 
— 
20 

minutes early, as Luce says — 
and concentration on the games 
ahead. For Nagelvoort, though, 
it is imperative that the team 
stay occupied on the trip.

“We’re there to play two 

hockey 
games,” 
Nagelvoort 

said. “I get it, that’s obviously 
the focus of the time there. But 
I’m totally subscribed to the 
theory that you can’t only be 
thinking about that the entire 
time, otherwise you’re going to 
drive yourself nutty, especially 
as a goalie.”

“You can’t only 

be thinking 

about (hockey) 
the entire time.”

Three’s company for ‘M’

On Oct. 16, junior guard 

Katelynn Flaherty tweeted a 
photo of a Shot Tracker placed 
below 
a 
basketball 
net 
at 

Michigan’s practice gym.

The 
machine 
had 
three 

numbers written on it: 517 shots 
attempted. 500 shots made. 97 
percent made.

Flaherty posted this astonishing 

practice feat as a countdown to 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s first game of the season, 
but 
through 
the 
Wolverines 

first seven games, it has become 
representative of the Michigan’s 
dominant 3-point shooting.

At 
45.5 
percent, 
the 

Wolverines currently hold the 
nation’s best 3-point field goal 
percentage. They’re also scoring 
at a high volume, making the 
fifth-most 
3-pointers 
in 
the 

country — trailing fourth-place 
Sacramento State by just 2 with 
82 fewer attempts.

Most of Michigan’s 3-point 

prowess comes from Flaherty 
and 
senior 
guard 
Siera 

Thompson, who are second 
and first, respectively, on the 
Wolverines’ all-time 3-point list 
with 205 and 209 shots made 
from behind the arc.

Thompson’s 
talent 
beyond 

the arc has been subtle and hard 
to defend, as the starting point 
guard and season assists leader 
also has an arsenal that extends 
beyond her outside shooting, 
posing a difficult test for opposing 
point guards.

“Siera’s been terrific all season 

long,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico. “Coming into this 
year we talked and said, ‘Siera 
you have to score for us a little 
bit more, you can really knock 
down shots and take some of the 
pressure off of Katelynn.’ ”

Though Thompson’s place atop 

the 3-pointer list is noteworthy, 
Flaherty is well on her way to 
becoming the greatest shooter 
in Michigan’s history less than a 

quarter of the season through her 
junior campaign.

In fact, Barnes Arico and 

the rest of the team are more 
surprised when she misses.

“Any time she shoots the ball, 

we know there’s a good chance 
it’s going in,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She makes it really hard for 
other teams to defend us because 
she’s such a great scorer.”

While Flaherty and Thompson 

are the main 3-point threats 
— knocking down 33 of the 
Wolverines’ 65 3-pointers this 
season — Michigan has displayed 
its depth of long-range shooters.

Off the bench, sophomore 

guard 
Nicole 
Munger 
and 

freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick have shown veteran 
poise from the 3-point line.

Munger 
already 
has 
10 

3-pointers to her name this season 
after hitting 21 in 34 appearances 
last year. Her shooting proved to 
be vital against No. 25 Gonzaga 
last Thursday. After the Bulldogs 
tore off an 8-0 run to bring 
Michigan’s lead to four with 
3:19 in the final quarter, Munger 
stymied their momentum with 
a 3-pointer and a drew a charge 
on the following play to seal the 
victory.

Gondrezick 
was 
a 
highly 

touted 
recruit 
because 
of 

her scoring abilities, and her 
transition to the college game 
has looked seamless, as she has 
averaged 2.3 3-pointers a game as 
the first player off the bench.

While the Wolverines are 

confident in their game from 
deep, they also like to emphasize 
improvements on defense so that 
they don’t have to live and die by 
the 3.

“Our defense has gotten better, 

and that is something we really 
stressed in the offseason,” Barnes 
Arico said. “But our ability to 
shoot the ball and go in transition 
is something we did pretty well 
last year. We are continuing in 
that same direction this year 
with a little bit more experience 
and more confidence.”

efore the election, I admit I was going to take a 
different angle to a piece about late night and the 
election. I was going to talk about how the election 

helped fill the void left at the top of the late-night space 
from Jon Stewart leaving. Through coverage of the elec-
tion, comedians such as Samantha Bee and Seth Mey-
ers established themselves at the top of their game. But 
over the past couple weeks, I’ve noticed myself turning to 
these late-night comedians. Instead of thinking about the 
new late-night pecking order, I’ve found myself working 
through my emotions about the election by watching the 
late night shows. It’s been cathartic to watch them work 
through the same feelings I had and grapple with what the 
next four years are going to be like.

One of the unsung heroes of the late-night space during 

the 2016 election has to be Seth Meyers. When his show 
debuted in 2014, it was fine. He wasn’t doing anything par-
ticularly special or different about it. But, in the summer 
of 2015, Meyers made a transition. Instead of standing on 
the stage giving a monologue, he moved behind the desk 
and delivered jokes similarly to how he had on “Saturday 
Night Live.” He was clearly more comfortable behind the 
desk than standing on a stage, and it made watching him 
more enjoyable. He then developed a segment called “A 
Closer Look,” which is several minutes long and a sharp, 
hysterical deep dive into issues like President-elect Donald 
Trump’s predatory behavior or the presidential debates. 
On his first post-election show, he was smart and reflec-
tive on both his past and what the future will bring. In the 
monologue, he was clearly shaken by what happened, just 
as I was. But, hearing him work through his emotions with 
jokes made me laugh, which was exactly what I needed.

During this election cycle, one of late night’s strongest 

and most powerful voices, “Full Frontal with Samantha 
Bee,” premiered. Throughout the campaign, Bee’s sharp 
jokes, often told with a seething rage, led to compelling 
and hilarious TV. After the election, she went on the air 
and talked about things like how scared her staff (the most 
diverse in late night) is about the results of the election. 
But, at the end of the segment, she went through some of 
the positives to come out of the election, like historic elec-
tions of senators in Illinois and California. Like Meyers, 
Bee ended on an optimistic note, which was exactly what 
I needed to hear.

With the rise of Meyers and Bee, I found myself asking 

a question: Is John Oliver still the best and sharpest voice 
in late night? In his third season, Oliver continued doing 
what he does best, and constantly had great lines about 
Trump and how awful this election was. But, as the third 
season went along, I found myself less interested in watch-
ing. I still saw every episode, but it was no longer the first 
thing I watched on a Monday morning. His post-election 
episode was as good as Bee’s or Oliver’s, but there’s some-
thing about his humor that feels less fresh than it used to.

One show I haven’t talked about yet is “Saturday Night 

Live,” but I do want to mention them because of their cold 
open from a couple weeks ago. It was simple: Kate McK-
innon as Clinton sitting at a piano singing “Hallelujah,” a 
song written by Leonard Cohen, who passed away several 
days after the election. After the election, the show had a 
lot of pressure to do something. By doing this, it showed it 
couldn’t do jokes as usual, and it nearly left me in tears. I 
don’t exactly know why, but there’s something about McK-
innon singing one of my favorite songs and talking about 
not losing hope that got to me.

For 
the 
past 
couple 
weeks, 
I’ve 
been 
try-

ing 
to 
maintain 
the 
sense 
of 
optimism 
that 

drives who I am. I’m trying to have faith in this country 
and faith in the American people. That’s particularly hard 
in a time like this one, but it’s something I need to do. I 
can’t let myself be broken by one night — and that’s made 
it just a little bit easier watching comedians like Bee, Mey-
ers and Oliver attempt to hold Trump accountable on their 
shows.

hen I was looking at study abroad programs 
for the winter semester of my junior year, the 
overwhelming number of places I could go 

both excited and scared me. Ross Global Initiatives and the 
Center for Global and Intercultural Studies offer programs 
to over 40 countries. I felt and continue to feel lucky to be 
student at such an international-reaching university, where 
the opportunities to travel and learn are plentiful.

Although I’m a seasoned international traveler, I’d spent 

most of my time abroad for vacation or visiting family, 
with the exception of the six week language program I did 
in France last summer. I had never spent four months by 
myself in a place I’d never been, and I was hungry for this 
experience to be different from my past experiences. Since 
I’ve already lived and visited most of Europe, I decided to 
eliminate it from my list of potential places to go. Europe is a 
big place with hundreds of different cultures and thousands 
of things to do, I wanted to explore somewhere that I knew 
nothing about, and a culture that I had never experienced. 
I wanted to participate the Ross Global Initiatives Semester 
Abroad Program, which has partner schools mostly in 
Europe and Asia, so I chose Asia. I’d never been to Asia 
before and the idea frightened, but intrigued me. I’d be at 
least a 25 hour plane journey from home and in a completely 
opposite time zone.

In my research of different Asian countries and programs, 

I realized the vast differences I would be choosing between. 
The schools in China versus Thailand versus Singapore had 
many differences in class selection, student life and culture. 
For example, the International Education of Students 
School in Shanghai is a school that specifies in study abroad. 
Contrasting with the National University of Singapore, 
which is a large university that attracts students from all 
over the world for regular enrollment. An experience at a 
university that only has study abroad students, and learning 
to mesh with regular students is a completely different 
experience. As a whole, the huge continent offers a plethora 
of ways of life, landmarks, languages and peoples. Looking 
through the different schools, the variations and options 
were amazing. Singapore stood out to me for three distinct 
reasons: the school, the food and the travel opportunities.

When I go to Singapore, I will be attending the National 

University of Singapore. The school had all the academic 
requirements I was looking for, noted as the best University 
in Asia, as well as the travel opportunities I was looking 
for: Vietnam, Laos, Bali, Thailand, etc. Since I’m only 
in the country for about four months, this is the perfect 
opportunity to try something new, meet new people and 
maybe develop some new skills.

Singapore is known for its amazing food. It is estimated 

that almost 40% of the population is non-citizens, so 
naturally, the food is an agglomeration of Asian influences 
and European dishes. “Hawker centres,” or market places, 
boast many street food stalls — each with a different dish 
from India to Malaysia. I am so excited to try foods that aren’t 
generic in the United States and give myself the opportunity 
to branch out in tastes. Although the idea of eating some 
strange meats and vegetables I’ve never heard of makes me 
a little nervous, I’m looking forward to exploring.

I’m also looking forward to travelling. I plan to visit 

Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bali and maybe 
even Australia to visit family. The opportunity to visit all 
these places at once has never been available to me before. I 
also plan to travel with other exchange students that I meet 
at NUS and develop good relationships with people from 
all over the world. Singapore is a popular location for many 
students to study in all over the world, which makes it the 
perfect place to meet young students just like me. The best 
way to get to know someone is travel the world with them, 
and that’s exactly what I plan on doing.

Although I’m excited to do all these fun things while 

abroad, I do have some concerns. For example, Singapore has 
a very strict set of laws and regulations. Almost everyone’s 
heard that “gum is illegal to buy and chew” since the city 
cares deeply about cleanliness and order. One thing I’d never 
heard of before is that jaywalking is illegal and punishable 
by prison. As a converted “Ann Arbor-ian,” jaywalking is 
second nature to me, and I am guilty of stepping out into 
the street whenever I please. Let’s hope I don’t end up in 
prison during my four months there. Lastly, it is forbidden 
to urinate in an elevator. In fact, most elevators have urine 
detectors and if you dare to do so, you will be locked in the 
elevator until your arrest.

Ultimately, planning my study abroad and learning 

about my future temporary home has been one of the most 
exciting parts of fall semester. I plan to branch out in ways 
I never have before, meet people who will hopefully be my 
friends for life and expand my sense of cultural awareness.

A

ccording to this year’s enrollment 
overview from the University of 
Michigan’s Office of the Registrar, 

there are only 80 Native students at the 
University, making up 0.21 percent of those 
enrolled as of fall 2016. These students make 
up 0.17 percent of enrolled undergraduates 
and 
0.32 
percent 
of 
graduates 
and 

professional staff. In contrast, in 2015, 
Native Americans made up 2 percent of the 
country’s total population and 0.7 percent of 
the population in Michigan.

The number of students on campus has 

dropped from last year, when 92 students 
with Native heritage were listed as enrolled 
at the University.

However, students within the Native 

community said in interviews that issues 
of representation extend past the number 
of Native students on campus to visibility 
on the campus landscape, an issue they’ve 
confronted by building communities.

One 
expression 
of 
this 
community 

occurred the Sunday before Thanksgiving, 
where more than 40 people came to 
celebrate their Native identities over Native 
inspired food as part of November’s Native 

American Heritage Month. The feast was 
only one of NASA’s many events organized to 
commemorate the month-long celebration. In 
addition to several cultural and educational 
events, the group capped off the month with 
a performance by a Native singer and spoken 
word artist.

“Our numbers for enrollment are very, 

very low so I think that has a lot to say with 
the Native community on campus,” said 
NASA co-chair Kaitlin Gant, an LSA senior. 
“Since there’s so few of us it sometimes gets 
really discouraging, especially when we 
know people who are Native who could be 
here and they’re not. We would like to do 
some recruitment, and we’ve tried some of 
that, but we don’t have the resources to do 
so.”

Much of the University outreach to 

Native students is funneled through NASA, 
which organizes Native cultural programs 
throughout the year including annual events 
for the November heritage month and the 
Dance for Mother Earth Powwow in the 
spring.

In addition to NASA, the umbrella 

organization for Native members of the 

University community, there are several 
other specialized organizations available 
for Native students, including the American 
Indian in Science and Engineering Society, 
the Latin American and Native American 
Medical 
Association 
and 
the 
Native 

American Law Association.

“What we aim to do on campus is to give 

Native American students a community 
of support where they can explore their 
identities and to just give them a sense of 
Native culture,” Gant said.

While membership varies, Gant said NASA 

has about 12 core members who help out 
and attend every meeting and event, though 
turnout tends to be significantly higher at 
events, which are open to the public. Still, 
spreading the word can be difficult given the 
group’s size.

“It’s so hard when there’s not a lot of 

Native American students on campus,” Gant 
said. “So when so many of us are busy it 
really takes a toll.”

Gant said the University also provides 

assistance through its support of NASA’s 
Powwow, with Assistant Vice Provost Dilip 
Das acting as the group’s point person in 

helping with funding and administration.

“It’s isolating (being Native on campus), 

but we do have a strong community,” 
Rackham student Jeremiah Thompson said. 
“We come from many different disciplines. 
We have to seek that out and create that for 
ourselves and I think the University does 
support us. I think of course we wouldn’t 
mind having more support.”

NASA also receives resources from the 

University’s Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs. 
However, Jasmine Pawlicki, a University 
alum and current library assistant, said 
it is easy for Native American students to 
sometimes get overlooked because MESA 
represents a large number of student groups.

“Native American students are a relatively 

small number on campus,” Pawlicki said. 
“There’s this issue where the students were 
asking for a dedicated person to help support 
them and they’ve been asking for it for 10 
years but so far it hasn’t come to fruition.”

While appreciative of the University’s 

support for NASA and the annual Powwow, 
Thompson said he does not feel that Native 
students are well represented in the campus 
landscape.

“This is my ancestral homeland and I 

belong here and we’re not really represented 
on campus,” he said. “ … When you look at the 
Law School, whose history is represented 
there? It’s not mine. When you look at the 
buildings and who they’re named for, it’s 
not my history, and yet not so long ago this 
was tribal land. This is where my people are 
from.”

While acknowledging that the University 

has become gradually more inclusive in the 
most recent chapter of its history, Thompson 
said the campus itself continues to ignore the 
contributions of women and marginalized 
groups.

“We don’t have a statue, we don’t have 

something that says ‘in memoriam’ or ‘in 
commemoration of the people who gave up 
this land and gave this land grant institution,’ 
” Thompson said. “I would like to see more 
things that acknowledge that … to be visible 
and to be part of the structuring. That’s not 
much to ask I don’t think.”

***

Though the University’s campus is littered 

with markers commemorating distinguished 
scholars, graduated classes and generous 
donors, one stone plaque on the edge of the 
Diag is dedicated to the Ojibwa, Odawa and 
Bodewadmi tribes who granted land to the 
University in 1817.

Twenty years before Michigan became a 

state, the United States and several Native 
American tribes signed the Treaty of Fort 
Meigs, which agreed that the tribes would 
cede their land and allow for the foundation 
of the University. Though the treaty is as old 
as the University, the plaque was erected to 
honor the gift in 2002.

Native students statewide also have the 

Michigan Indian Tuition Waiver, which 
allows students to apply to have their 
tuition waived for enrollment at a state 
public college or university. To be eligible 
for the waiver, which is processed by the 

Department of Civil Rights, students must 
be a legal resident of the state for at least 
12 consecutive months, certified at least 
25-percent Native American and enrolled in 
a U.S. federally recognized tribe.

The Waiver of Tuition for North American 

Indians Act was first passed in the Michigan 
Legislature in 1976 — culminating from early 
20th-century laws and agreements that the 
state would assume responsibility from the 
federal government for the education of 
Native students. The tuition waiver gained 
support in Michigan after a failed 1971 
lawsuit claimed the University had violated 
the Treaty at Fort Meigs by using the land 
without providing education guarantees to 
Native students. 

The act has been amended several times 

since it was first passed, mainly to loosen 
eligibility restrictions and allow universities 
to be reimbursed by the state for the cost of 
the waiver.

However, there have also been legislative 

attempts to dissolve the program. The most 
recent effort was in 1996, when Gov. John 
Engler said he would veto the next higher 
education budget if it included funding for 
the MITW program. Rallies were held in 
protest around the state and, though the 
program was removed from the budget, 
it was saved when funding was instead 
reallocated into the base per pupil funding 
of each university and college.

Thompson, who is an enrolled member 

of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa 
Indians, is a recipient of the tuition waiver 
and said it’s partly why he goes to the 
University.

“The tuition waiver program is kind of 

always under constant threat and I need to 
utilize it,” he said. “It’s something that is a 
benefit that may not last forever. I certainly 
hope it does.”

According 
to 
Vicki 
Levengood, 
the 

communications director at the Michigan 

Department of Civil Rights, 1,093 waivers 
were 
granted 
at 
Michigan’s 
four-year 

universities for 2014-2015. As of January 
2016, 4 percent of program applications are 
for enrollment at the University.

“It’s a really hard process to get approved 

for the tuition waiver,” Gant said.

Though a native of Michigan, Gant said 

she is not eligible for the waiver because 
she is a member of the Oneida tribe, which 
is based out of Canada and not federally 
recognized by the United States.

As an unrecognized Native student, 

Engineering junior Gabrielle May doesn’t 
have access to resources like the MITW 
program. Though many of her relatives are 
registered in tribes, she said her parents 
encountered trouble trying to enroll.

“There’s not really any resources for me,” 

she said. “I am doing OK otherwise. I think I 
probably would have done OK or better with 
the resources but they’re unreliable. Good 
for some but not for all.”

Higher education assistance programs for 

Native students are offered in other states as 
well, with varying access and administration 
challenges. Though in some states, tuition 
waivers and scholarships are operated only 
by individual colleges.

With Heritage Month coming to a close, 

NASA will soon be turning the bulk of its 
efforts to planning its biggest cultural event: 
the annual spring Powwow.

The organization prides itself on hosting 

the largest student-run Powwow in the 
country, featuring on average more than 
50 Native vendors, feasting, singing and 
dancing. This will be NASA’s 45th year 
organizing the two-day event, which sees 
hundreds of visitors from around the 
country.

“It’s a huge Powwow,” said Law student 

Jason Searle, a non-Native student who 
helped organize last year’s event. “A lot of 

tribes know about it and they all come to sell 
food and items as well as perform dances and 
cultural performances, which were great.”

Held at Skyline High School, the Powwow 

is painstakingly organized by members of 
NASA in collaboration with the University’s 
MESA and Eastern Michigan University’s 
Native American Student Organization. The 
event moved from its usual spot at the Crisler 
Center two years ago, but the organization 
hopes to eventually bring it back to campus.

“It’s great to be involved in a student 

organization that’s helping highlight and 
keep alive these cultural practices, and 
Powwow being a big one,” Searle said. “... It’s 
a big endeavor for students to take on but it’s 
really rewarding.”

Social Work student Shandiin Church said 

she has been attending powwows since she 
could walk and that dancing is a tradition in 
her family.

“Powwows are open to the public. It’s a 

celebration,” she said. “Some people think 
it’s a ritual and there’s something spooky 
about it … but it’s very celebratory. It’s 
a celebration, it’s a social gathering. It’s 
nothing tribal specific like just to one tribe. 
There’s 566 tribes in the United States and 
this is just something common that we all 
share.”

Gant said there is a lack of information 

in history books about Native Americans 
and encourages non-Native students to ask 
questions and try to learn more about Native 
culture.

“Being Native is something a lot of people 

don’t understand because they haven’t had 
the chance to learn about it yet,” Gant said. 
“A lot of people see being Native American 
as something of the past that doesn’t really 
exist anymore.”

native american 
representation 
on campus


I 

never understood the hype, and I’m still not really 
sure if I do. The aura that surrounds sports at 
the University of Michigan is unique, and as a 

photojournalist for The Michigan Daily, I view it all from 
a unique perspective. It’s humbling to stand on a field 
surrounded by thousands of screaming fans that live and 
breathe Michigan sports while I, as a photojournalist, must 
remain neutral. I had never cared about Michigan or its 
sporting teams until I began photographing them.

I never understood why people became so emotionally 

distraught after a loss or called their rivals such awful 
names. As a photojournalist, my job is to take experiences 
that I see through my viewfinder and present them to our 
readers in an unbiased fashion. Through my experience, 
I’ve captured the raw emotions and passions that people 
have for this school and its teams. The genuine passion, 
heartbreak and cheers from fans, along with players’ 
intricate athleticism, have allowed me to understand in 
a small sense the immense pride that these Michigan 
fans display. It’s even made me reflect on one of my own 
passions as well: the practice of photography.

I began to seriously consider photography in high 

school when I took AP Studio Art my senior year. My 
teacher was the first person that really believed in my 
passions for the craft, and I’ll forever be thankful for the 
confidence he instilled in me. Through his guidance and 
encouragement, I decided to attend Ohio University to 
study photojournalism, a major that seemed to combine 
two of my passions in high school: writing and photography.

At Ohio University, I enrolled in my first college-level 

photography class and was shocked about everything I 
didn’t know. My high school classes never spoke about 

things like F-stops or ISO numbers, and I felt incredibly 
lost. One of my first photo assignments at OU required us 
to shoot a sporting event. I hadn’t photographed any sort of 
sport prior to college, and I chose to attend a field hockey 
game. I entered the field with some other classmates, and 
after reviewing my photos I felt a sense of confidence arise. 
However, my photos were torn to shreds the next day, 
quickly erasing my positive thoughts and sending me into 
a spiral of self-doubt in my photography.

Pulitzer-winning professors and kids with years of high 

school photography experience and classes under their 
belts surrounded me; I was attending one of the best schools 
for photojournalism in the country. It seemed as though 
my dreams would come true and I would someday land 
that dream job at National Geographic every photographer 
wants at some point in their journey. But I was completely 
lost. They all knew how to capture the perfect photos in 
comparison to the images I was producing, and really 
knew how to connect with their subjects on a deep, 
personal level. One of the most important aspects to 
photography is building a connection with subjects to 
create a more natural feel in photographs, something that 
I wasn’t achieving at all. The passion that I let lead me to 
OU seemed to be quickly depleting, and I wanted out of 
that corner of southeast Ohio as quickly as possible. The 
medium that had once given me confidence and purpose 
had proven to be a fluke, or so it seemed.

I was too overwhelmed with the stress I felt at OU, and 

I knew the photojournalism lifestyle wasn’t for me. I saw 
how it affected my peers: biting their nails until they were 
raw after class critiques, many tears and the feeling of 
worthlessness. I decided that photography was something 

I no longer had a passion for because of all the emotional 
stress it brought upon me. This led to my decision to look 
elsewhere for school, and I ended up at the University 
of Michigan. When I was accepted to Michigan, I never 
thought I’d pick up a camera again for a publication. I was 
ecstatic to leave Ohio in my past and travel back to my home 
state to attend college. When I loaded the car to depart for 
Ann Arbor going into sophomore year, I remember almost 
forgetting to bring my camera. On a whim, I threw it into 
the trunk, and it traveled with me.

Though my time at Ohio University wasn’t ideal, 

I wouldn’t trade this experience for an extra year at 
Michigan. The experience and photography knowledge 
I gained are invaluable, and it truly helped widen my 
perspective. I recognize, now, that I needed to be torn 
apart to build upon my practice and I could never achieve 
great photos if I was never criticized for my subpar work 
that I was producing at OU.

My first sport assignment for the Daily was a women’s 

basketball game. I walked into the Crisler Center, and I 
know I must’ve had a dumbfounded face because a member 
of the event staff immediately asked if it was my first time 
in the building. I made my way to the sideline under the 
basket and took a seat on the blue-stained hardwood and 
let the feeling sink in. Though there were hardly any fans 
in attendance and the team hadn’t exited the locker room 
yet, I was hit with a feeling of pride — a virtue I hardly 
ever allow myself to feel at all, let alone in great depth. 
This feeling was a sort of validation that I needed with my 
photography: despite the fact that I was no longer studying 
it professionally, I was beginning to pick up events that 
held greater importance than anything I photographed in 
Ohio.

When I left Ohio, I never expected that, within the 

following two years, I would see president-elect Donald 
Trump passionately explain his platform to his supporters 
in Novi, Twenty One Pilots from two feet away, football 
coach Jim Harbaugh at the unveiling of Michigan’s new 
Jumpman football jerseys and Iowa football fans swept 
up in a crowd celebrating a win against Michigan. During 
these experiences, I’ve had these small moments of pride, 
and I’ve allowed them to drive my ambition in all of the 
events that I cover.

This past October, I walked onto the plush turf of the 

Big House and was greeted with cheers and whistles. Sure, 
these cheers weren’t directed at me, but I immediately felt 
a sense of pride and accomplishment. Just like in Crisler, 
I paused outside the tunnel (probably blocking someone’s 
way) and allowed myself to stop and soak in the feeling 
that swirls around the stadium on Saturdays. Standing on 
the field was one of the most surreal feelings that I’ve ever 
felt, and it has lingered with me even a month after the 
game.

Through photography, I have found a voice through 

which I feel that I can truly speak. Though I don’t specialize 
in posed portraits, I am able to capture the essence of 
everyday life and moments that aren’t always seen. I feel 
as though I have a true calling to capture a small essence 
of life’s candid moments. This ideology has definitely 
manifested itself when I cover sports for the Daily. Often, 
my favorite photos aren’t of the game itself, but of intimate 
moments that occur on the sidelines or in between plays.

My contraption of metal and glass has given me a comfort 

through my trials of self-doubt, a comfort that despite the 
feeling of drowning, I can find hope in my subjects. I’ve 
not only allowed it to become a sense of comfort, but also a 
method to push myself further through all that I do.

Though I still may not understand the undying love 

for something like sports, I am forever grateful that it has 
allowed me to find my own passions behind the lens.

Coming into Focus

“

People are afraid to merge on freeways in Los Angeles.” - Bret Easton Ellis, “Less Than 
Zero”

If you’re from Los Angeles or know anything about it, the first thing that comes 

to mind is the city’s horrendous traffic. And yes, for those not from L.A., the traffic is 
indeed horrible.

As a resident of Los Angeles, I can attest to this. Getting to school in the mornings and 

coming home in the afternoons was a pain, especially when I had to take the freeway. The 
route going to and from places eerily coincides with tongue-in-cheek SNL sketch “The 
Californians”: You take the 10 East, merge onto the 405 North and get off at Mulholland. 
If the freeway is too crazy, take the Canyons, preferably Laurel or Coldwater. Waze and 
Google Maps become somewhat reliable guides when it comes to getting around the city. 
Other forms of transportation seem hopeless in an area that’s connected mostly through 
roads. The subway and train system is expanding, but it’s practically nonexistent and 
inefficient at the moment. Biking is fun and environmentally friendly, but cyclists are 
known to be a nuisance. And while the Metro buses are helpful in getting around places 
locally, driving a car has been and probably will continue to be the dominant mode of 
transit in L.A.

I’ve always felt the car culture reflected a lot of what Los Angeles represents as a 

city. It’s spread out, spacious and horizontal — the inverse of New York City’s vertical, 
claustrophobic and skyscraper-heavy island. To me, L.A. is a strange and surreal paradox, 
a bustling city rich in mythology, a flawed paradise that prides itself on diversity but is 
racially and socioeconomically divided. It’s at once fascinating and alienating.

At its core, Los Angeles is a desert, but over time, its ecosystem has been upended 

by man-made structures and freeways to make way for the city’s growing population. 
Over the years, Los Angeles went through several cultural shifts as it expanded, from 
the cozy suburbia of the ‘60s to the wild groove of the ‘70s to the neon glam of the ‘80s 
to the racial turbulence of the ‘90s. As of now, it’s become an epicenter for musically 
inclined hipsters, aspiring actors, ambitious screenwriters, fitness freaks, Instagram 
models, gluten-sensitive foodies, faux-famous social media stars and quasi-cynics like 
myself who complain about them, all living underneath a smog-heavy bubble populated 

with palm trees. 

Growing up, I got to know the city of L.A. by being driven through it. One of my 

earliest memories involved driving, in which I witnessed my first car crash at age 4. 
After I visited the doctor for my annual checkup, my mom and I saw two cars collide at 
an intersection. Since then, I feel as though I subconsciously internalized that moment 
in order to make sure that, if I was ever going to drive, I would avoid crashing my car 
at all costs — I have not been in any accidents thus far, though there were several close 
calls.

Being the younger one in the family, I was relegated to the backseat during my 

childhood but slowly made my way to the passenger seat when I was 12 years old. Either 
way, I would have to ask my parents, my sister or my aunt to drive me places until I got 
my driver’s permit. Almost every afternoon in eighth grade, I had to take the Metro bus 
home or wait for hours until my mom or dad could pick me up. In high school, I was 
driven in a carpool during my freshman and junior year and had to take the regular bus 
during my sophomore year. During all that time, I never felt like I had the control and 
responsibility that I often yearned for when it came to driving. I always had to depend 
on others to take me where I wanted to go. Luckily, when I did get to drive more during 
my senior year, I finally fulfilled my dream of exploring L.A. on my own terms.

Because a lot of my friends lived in the San Fernando Valley and I lived in the city, 

I would plan out my trips in order to avoid traffic on the 405, despite the inevitability 
of some back-up on the freeway. Even though the drives there were often aggravating, 
the late-night rides back home were fantastic because I would be cruising down a dark, 
empty road by myself, staring at the red glow of the cars driving in front of me and 
hearing the whoosh of the ones that would pass me. As I coasted on the streets through 
flashing lights and billboards, I felt free, limitless and able to appreciate the romantic 
undertones of Los Angeles.

Driving also gave me the agency to control the music; I’d load up my car ride playlist 

on Spotify to play songs that transformed the city into a cinematic experience. Late-
night drives often consisted of listening to the wistful melancholy of Yo La Tengo’s 
“Nowhere Near” or Cage the Elephant’s “Cigarette Daydreams.” If I was taking Laurel 
Canyon from Studio City or Sunset Boulevard from West Hollywood, I would alternate 
between the adrenaline-pumping pop of Hellogoodbye’s “(Everything Is) Debatable” 
and the chilling piano balladry of Tobias Jesso Jr.’s “Hollywood.” If I was feeling 
nostalgic for the 1980s, which I often was, I’d turn up Flock of Seagulls’s “I Ran” or The 
Cure’s “Friday I’m in Love.” Or if I was feeling really cinematic, I would put on songs 
with direct references to L.A.: The Eagles’ “Hotel California,” the Mamas & the Papas’s 
“California Dreamin’” and Albert Hammond’s “It Never Rains in Southern California.” 

To truly know and live in Los Angeles is to drive through it, to explore its hidden gems, 

to seek out the city’s authenticity hindered by its distractingly ostentatious artifice. This 
past summer, I drove through and visited several areas in L.A. for the first time, or at 
least some places for the first time in a long while.

I went to Venice, where I perused the Venice Canals with my mom and ate paleo-

friendly shaved ice cream with my sister and dad. I developed a love for Swingers, a 
phenomenal vintage diner located in Hollywood and Santa Monica that serves a variety of 
delicious food 24/7 — I highly recommend getting the avocado toast, a protein shake and 
a fruit platter for breakfast. I hung out at Larchmont, a swanky, pleasant neighborhood 
with great restaurants but inconvenient parking. On Father’s Day, my sister, dad and I 
hiked at Lake Hollywood, a dirt path surrounding the Hollywood Reservoir that offers a 
gorgeous view of the L.A. horizon. After an hour or two of walking and talking, the three 
of us ventured to Grand Central Market in Downtown, a large space with high ceilings, 
a mixture of pungent smells and an overwhelming sensory overload. We waited almost 
an hour in line to eat at Eggslut, a mouth-watering gourmet eatery that specializes in 
egg-based concoctions. Though I hated the Santa Monica beach as a kid, I drove with 
my mom there almost every Sunday afternoon to go on a morning run and spent some 
time basking in the sun. 

People often ask me why I came to Michigan from Los Angeles, why I left the city’s 

warmth for Ann Arbor’s cold, harsh weather. This was also surprising to many, because 
I want to enter a career in the film industry and Los Angeles is the perfect place for it, 
notably being the entertainment capital of the world. The truth is I actually wanted 
to escape L.A., not stay in it. Despite 18 years of living in a city with pitch-perfect 
temperature, I didn’t want to limit myself to just living in Los Angeles for another four 
years. There are many things that I love about L.A., but there is so much more to this big 
world of ours than home and it’s easy to get stuck there.

I feel like most Angelenos who don’t leave L.A. are always stuck in existential and 

literal gridlock, unmotivated to take the wheel and unearth the treasures of the city they 
live in. People are afraid to merge, to connect with their own hometown and to escape 
their comfort zone. “What causes traffic?” is a question I ask myself a lot when I’m 
driving. I’ve learned that construction, car accidents, rubberneckers and texting drivers 
are the primary sources of car pileups. But perhaps the real cause might stem from a fear 
of wanting to leave and not being able to.

To Live and Drive in L.A.

Journalists look out from a hill overlooking the camp.

Water protectors — as those working to stop then pipeline prefer to be called — 
hold signs and gather as they approach the police last Thursday.

The road leading into the main standing Standing Rock camp, Oceti Sakowin Camp, is lined with flags of over 140 tribes.

On Thanksgiving, police stand on sacred burial grounds as 
water protectors watch from below, asking them to leave.

Ryder Foster, 4, is a part of the Cherokee and Anishaabe tribes. 
From Kalamazoo, MI, he came with his mother and sister.

A Lakota water song is shown on a piece of paper.

Instead of driving an hour home to be with my family for 
Thanksgiving, I drove seventeen hours to document the 
camps and people at the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in 
North Dakota, acting as water protectors in resistance of the 
Dakota Access Pipeline. Though these photos could never 
tell the full story, I hope they shed light into the incredible 
people dedicating their time to fight for clean water and the 
rights of indigenous people.

Two women join hands while discussing their time at the camp.
