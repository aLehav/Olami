The Ann Arbor City Council 

met Monday evening via Zoom in 

a public livestream. Despite the 

meeting’s alternative format, the 

council kept its usual structure, 

including 
public 
comments 

via 
phone 
calls 
and 
speakers 

from 
various 
city 
government 

organizations, informing the public 

on issues such as zoning policy and 

the city budget.

With people across the country 

as well as local tenants calling for 

a rent freeze, or the forgiveness of 

debt, council members took up the 

issue.

Council members unanimously 

passed a resolution that extended 

eviction prevention for tenants of 

Ann Arbor Housing Commission 

properties. The resolution also 

allocated $200,000 in emergency 

assistance funds. 

Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman, D-Ward 3, said the 

COVID-19 
outbreak 
and 
the 

necessary public health solutions, 

such as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s 

“Stay Home, Stay Safe” Executive 

Order, have had major economic 

repercussions that impact Ann 

Arbor tenants. 

“We have a set of tenants who 

find themselves in a financial 

hole and, when the states release 

their hold on evictions, may face 

becoming homeless very quickly,” 

Ackerman said. “As a community 

and an affluent one, in fact the most 

affluent in the state, we can take it 

upon ourselves to fill that hole.”

Councilmember 
Jack 
Eaton, 

D-Ward 4, said the council should 

strive to help the Ann Arbor 

community during this difficult 

time.

“We are really going to have 

a 
horrible 
economy 
for 
the 

foreseeable future, and to the extent 

that we can help our residents, we 

should do that,” Eaton said. 

The 
council 
opened 
their 

meeting 
with 
comments 
from 

various council members to the 

public. Council members used this 

time to thank essential workers, 

citizens for 3D-printing protective 

equipment for health care workers 

and citizens doing their part by 

social distancing.

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 

Taylor 
encouraged 
citizens 

to continue to practice social 

distancing.

“Go outside, but do so in a 

matter that is safe,” Taylor said. 

“Your attention to detail will help 

a nurse on her shift or a doctor on 

her rounds. Your attention to detail 

will save lives, so please be careful 

at all times.”

The recent coronavirus outbreak 

has sent the economy reeling, with 

fears of a looming recession and 

massive spikes in unemployment. 

The 
federal 
government 
has 

stepped in to provide relief for 

individuals 
and 
corporations 

through a series of economic 

stimulus packages over the past 

several weeks. 

At $2 trillion, the most recent 

bill is the largest stimulus bill in 

U.S. history. As part of the package, 

millions of people older than age 18 

will receive $1,200 checks, with an 

additional $500 checks going to the 

parents of qualifying children under 

age 18. The legislation includes 

$377 billion to small businesses and 

boosts unemployment benefits by 

$600 per week.

However, college students and 

young adults across the country 

are largely ineligible to receive 

benefits because they are claimed 

as dependents by their parents. 

Students have struggled to deal 

with the economic toll of the virus, 

facing internship cancellations and 

the loss of on-campus jobs. Many 

students are also bound to pay rent 

for 12-month leases in Ann Arbor 

while they are away, and many 

students have had trouble finding 

people to sublet their apartments 

over the summer. 

Thomas 
Lyon, 
professor 
of 

sustainable 
science, 
technology 

and commerce at the University 

of 
Michigan, 
called 
the 
bill 

“enormous and complex,” noting 

the importance of providing relief 

for everyday Americans. He said 

the bill would provide some help for 

students regarding loan payments.

A worker welds materials in preparation for a field hospital at the TCF Center in Detroit Monday afternoon. Governor Gretchen Whitmer designated 
the center as an “alternate care facility” and it’s largely being built by Michigan National Guard soldiers and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

In honor of Asian/Pacific Islander 

American Heritage Month, the Multi-

Ethnic Student Affairs held a virtual 

event on Monday with feminist 

blogger Jenn Fang titled “Speaking 

Up and Speaking Out: Why the AAPI 

Community 
Must 
Be 
Politically 

Engaged.” 
Forty-three 
viewers 

tuned into the event, during which 

Fang discussed the history of A/PIA 

activism and the anti-Asian racism 

in light of the ongoing coronavirus 

pandemic.

Fang is the founder, editor and 

primary blogger of Reappropriate, 

one of the oldest and most popular 

A/PIA race advocacy and feminism 

blogs. Her writing has been featured 

in NBC News, Teen Vogue and The 

Washington Post. 

Fang began the event by discussing 

her 
personal 
background 
with 

activism, which she said started when 

she was an undergraduate at Cornell 

University and took a class in Asian 

American studies. In this class, Fang 

said she learned material beyond what 

she was taught in high school history 

classes.

In high school, Fang said she 

learned about the Chinese American 

Exclusion Act, an immigration law 

that prevented Chinese laborers from 

coming to the United States. She said 

she was also taught that many Chinese 

immigrants were crucial to the 

construction of the Transcontinental 

Railroad, the first railroad to connect 

both coasts of the U.S., despite 

dangerous conditions and widespread 

discrimination.

In college, Fang said she learned 

more about the indentured servitude 

of Asian American laborers on West 

Coast sugar plantations. Fang noted 

these 
Chinese, 
Japanese, 
Korean 

and Filipino agricultural workers 

partially helped inspire America’s 

labor movement. 

She also highlighted the importance 

of Michigan as the home of one of her 

role models, Grace Lee Boggs. 

“Michigan is an especially integral 

point for Asian American activism, as 

Troy was home to Grace Lee Boggs, a 

community activist, scholar and my 

personal hero,” Fang said. “She taught 

me that our work is founded upon 

the assertion that Asian and Pacific 

Islander Americans are, for better 

or for worse, part of this country’s 

national and political fabric.” 

Fang used the murder of Vincent 

Chin to continue her discussion 

of 
Asian 
American 
history 
and 

oppression in the state of Michigan. 

In 1982, autoworkers Ronald Ebens 

and 
Michael 
Nitz 
brutally 
beat 

and murdered Chin at his bachelor 

party in Highland Park days before 

his wedding date. They blamed the 

Japanese automotive companies for 

losing their jobs and mistook Chin as 

a Japanese man. 

Despite their role in Chin’s murder, 

the judge stated, “these weren’t the 

kind of men you sent to jail.” The two 

men were only sentenced to three 

years of probation and a $3,000 fine. 

Taking this history into account, 

Fang emphasized the need for the 

awareness 
of 
anti-Asian 
racism 

more than ever due to the ongoing 

coronavirus pandemic. The virus has 

been deemed by some — including 

President Donald Trump — as the 

“Chinese Virus.” 

According 
to 
Fang, 
calling 

coronavirus 
the 
“Chinese 
Virus” 

is 
representative 
of 
the 
racial 

microaggressions, 
assaults 
and 

widespread systemic stigmatization 

of Asian people during the SARS 

epidemic 20 years ago.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

It began with introductions 

of SACUA’s three new members: 

Jennifer 
Caitlin 
Finlayson, 

associate professor of English 

literature at the U-M Dearborn; 

Allen Liu, associate professor 

of mechanical and biomedical 

engineering 
in 
the 
College 

of Engineering; and Kentaro 

Toyama, professor of information 

and community information in 

the School of Information. 

Collins then began speaking 

about the implications of the 

coronavirus 
pandemic 
along 

with the University’s response.

“We 
are 
committed 
to 

protecting health and safety 

while we proceed with the 

University’s 
core 
mission,” 

Collins 
said. 
“That 
includes 

instruction, 
maintaining 

academic 
continuity 
for 
our 

students and it also includes 

things like keeping on track the 

faculty promotions, which are 

so essential to the University’s 

long-term excellence.” 

To 
accommodate 
the 

challenges of online instruction, 

specifically for faculty, Collins 

discussed changes to course 

evaluations 
for 
the 
winter 

semester. 

“We are just about to roll out 

changes to the course evaluations 

for this semester … we’ve added 

new questions that will reflect 

the unusual circumstances and 

give lots more room for students 

to give qualitative feedback,” 

Collins said. “Evaluations will 

not in the traditional way be used 

to address promotion and tenure 

cases because the circumstances 

are just so unusual.” 

Additionally, 
Collins 

emphasized 
the 
mental 

health resources that remain 

accessible for both students and 

faculty. The Faculty and Staff 

Counseling 
and 
Consultation 

Office is providing telehealth 

counseling sessions to faculty 

and staff and their dependents. 

Counseling and Psychological 

Services is still open for virtual 

appointments and has added 

a few more resources to their 

website as well.

Collins also said incoming 

graduate 
students 
may 
face 

uncertainty in enrolling at the 

University in light of the rapidly 

changing economy. 

“There is more uncertainty 

about graduate and professional 

enrollments … in the short-run 

many students may choose to 

defer or forego their plans and 

we have certainly recognized 

that,” Collins said. “Or even 

considering the broader economy 

as a factor, sometimes when the 

economy is more challenged, 

more people go to graduate 

school.” 

Collins 
then 
opened 
the 

floor to questions from SACUA 

members. 
Colleen 
Conway, 

professor of music education 

in the School of Music, Theatre 

& 
Dance, 
asked 
about 
the 

consistency 
of 
messaging 

surrounding the new approach 

to course evaluations. 

“What is the language that is 

going to go out to faculty about 

the use of course evaluations 

in 
tenure 
and 
promotions?” 

Conway said. “Is it at the unit 

level that those decisions will be 

made?”

Collins said her intent is that 

the message comes from both her 

and the deans of the schools and 

colleges to reiterate that it does 

not make sense for evaluations 

for this semester to be used as 

they traditionally would be.

Annalisa Manera, a professor 

of 
nuclear 
engineering 
and 

radiological 
sciences 
in 
the 

College of Engineering, asked 

about plans regarding pauses in 

research for Ph.D. and graduate 

students. 

“In my department, this has 

already taken place, so I was 

wondering whether there are 

some plans of what to do with all 

the Ph.D. and postdoc students 

who are in these circumstances,” 

Manera said. 

Collins said some units are 

further 
along 
in 
monitoring 

students’ progress, adding that, 

overall, plans were being made 

on a case-by-case basis. 

Elena 
Gallo, 
an 
associate 

professor of astronomy in LSA, 

commented on the issue of 

stalled research.

“This is really a source of 

enormous stress for the graduate 

student population and students 

are extremely worried about 

funding 
continuity, 
so 
any 

approximate deadline (for plans 

moving 
forward) 
would 
be 

extremely helpful,” Gallo said. 

Though there is not yet a clear 

timeline, Collins said she would 

make communication regarding 

research plans a priority going 

forward. 

Collins emphasized her desire 

to utilize SACUA, especially in 

this unprecedented time, as the 

“eyes and ears” of campus in 

order to make future decisions. 

“We’re now in a place where 

we can be thoughtful about 

what we need to prioritize so 

there aren’t major pockets in our 

community that are not being 

considered,” Collins said.

“We could well find ourselves 

in an extended recession, making 

it hard for students graduating 

this year and next year to find 

the kind of jobs they were hoping 

for,” Lyon said. “This, in turn, 

makes repaying student loans 

more challenging. The stimulus 

bill provides some loan relief: 

no payments on federal loans 

through the U.S. Department of 

Education need be made until 

October, and no interest will 

accrue during that time. However, 

federal loans not run through the 

Department of Education are not 

affected, nor are private loans. 

There are no provisions for debt 

forgiveness. Thus, many students 

will not see any relief on their 

student loans.” 

Several 
students 
also 

commented 
on 
the 
historic 

stimulus package and what its 

implications 
are 
for 
college 

students. 

LSA 
freshman 
Nick 

Schuler, freshman chair of the 

University’s chapter of College 

Republicans, said these measures 

were 
necessary 
given 
the 

unprecedented circumstances of 

the coronavirus outbreak. 

“Because 
this 
is 
the 
first 

economic downturn to come from 

the service sector, the money 

must largely go directly to the 

hands of small businesses and 

the taxpayers which President 

(Donald) 
Trump 
has 
done,” 

Schuler said. “Which is why 

many students are frustrated, 

only those that work will receive 

a check which is equitable in my 

eyes.” 

Business sophomore Ari Bosse, 

vice president of investments for 

the Alternative Investments Club, 

told The Daily that the stimulus 

package was a necessary short-

term solution to the financial 

crisis facing the nation amid 

the coronavirus outbreak. Bosse 

said he understood the backlash 

from young adults over their 

exclusion from the federal check 

distributions. 

“College 
students 
classified 

as dependents have every right 

to be upset about being excluded 

from federal check distributions, 

as college students are often 

independently responsible for a 

variety of financial obligations,” 

Bosse 
said. 
“While 
a 
more 

inclusive plan would be preferred, 

it will be difficult to make a case 

for why the aid package — which 

is already the largest in history — 

should be expanded.” 

Business junior Jon Rotbard 

said the stimulus bill is able 

to 
provide 
a 
temporary 
fix 

during 
these 
unprecedented 

times. 
He 
also 
commented 

on the ineligibility of many 

college students who qualify as 

dependents for these stimulus 

checks. 

“From 
my 
understanding 

parents get more money if they 

have children or dependents so 

it evens out,” Rotbard said. “I 

think a dependent needs it a lot 

less than someone who’s actually 

been laid off and will seriously 

have their quality of life reduced 

without that check.”

The stimulus package also has 

provisions that benefit major 

businesses and corporations. 

Rotbard told The Daily that 

this stimulus is critical not only 

for individuals but for businesses 

as well. 

“From a finance and business 

perspective, (it) keeps businesses 

running 
too,” 
Rotbard 
said. 

“Most businesses have so much 

debt and so little cash that they 

will all shutter without massive 

stimulus.” 

Lyon was more critical of the 

inclusion of some of the features 

of the legislation, particularly a 

$500 billion corporate liquidity 

fund.

“The most questionable part 

of the package is the $500 billion 

fund to provide loans to large 

businesses,” Lyon said. “Many 

large businesses are sitting on 

large cash reserves and used 

much of the historic $1 trillion 

Trump tax cut to buy back their 

own shares. It is hard to see 

why big business(es) should be 

a high-priority concern for the 

U.S. at this time. The original 

Republican proposal had very 

few oversight measures on how 

the Trump administration could 

dole out the $500 billion, but at 

Democratic insistence, the final 

bill requires immediate disclosure 

of beneficiaries and includes some 

congressional oversight.”

LSA sophomore Regina Egan, 

communications director for the 

University’s chapter of College 

Democrats, declined to comment 

on the specifics of the bill but 

said the country is looking for 

leadership during this crisis. 

“We 
are 
living 
through 
a 

rare and tumultuous time in 

which the need for government 

is clearer now more than ever,” 

Egan said. “What Americans and 

young people especially need 

is government leadership and a 

system that serves each and every 

one of us.”

This discrimination, Fang said, 

is still present today. Fang also 

noted some media outlets continue 

to run stories of the pandemic 

alongside Asian faces, which she 

said contributes to the fear that 

some Asian Americans may have of 

being in public. 

“Just 
last 
week, 
the 
FBI 

described the attempted murder of 

an Asian American family as part 

of their warning of a growing surge 

in hate crimes against anyone 

perceived to be East Asian,” Fang 

said. “A website launched by the 

Asia Pacific Policy and Planning 

Council already received over 

1,000 self-reports in just two weeks 

of incidents of racial harassment 

and assault.” 

Recently, 
former 
Democratic 

presidential 
candidate 
Andrew 

Yang suggested in an op-ed in the 

Washington Post that the best way 

for Asian Americans to address 

the tide of racist violence directed 

towards 
them 
is 
to 
remind 

attackers of how Asians are still 

American. 

According 
to 
Fang, 
Yang’s 

statement 
suggests 
Asian 

Americans who have been attacked 

are at fault and have something to 

apologize for. 

“Let 
me 
be 
clear, 
Asian 

Americans are not responsible 

in any way for anti-Asian hate 

crimes against our community,” 

Fang said. “We have not invited, 

nor incited violence against our 

bodies, and we have nothing to 

apologize for and we see in Yang’s 

op-ed what happens when we are 

not connected to our history.” 

Fang ended her speech with a 

call for the A/PIA community to 

combat these injustices by working 

together 
with 
other 
minority 

communities.

“To be an Asian Pacific Islander 

American is to be inextricably 

interconnected with that of other 

Black and brown people and 

we must understand how our 

struggles are interrelated,” Fang 

said. “We must work in solidarity 

and understand we cannot afford 

tunnel vision and recognize that 

racial oppression does not occur in 

a vacuum.” 

LSA senior Dim Mang said she 

found Fang’s response to Yang’s 

article poignant. According to 

Mang, Fang’s emphasis on both 

learning and actively engaging 

with Asian American history was 

refreshing. 

“My biggest takeaway from this 

event was that Asian Americans 

must not allow white people and 

institutions to decide our history 

or even rewrite it for us,” Mang 

said. “We must stand in active 

solidarity with other people of 

color, and essentially use collective 

liberation.” 

LSA junior Osa Svensson logged 

onto the event due to it being 

a requirement for a class, but 

said they found Fang’s talk very 

impactful. Svensson said they were 

not previously taught about topics 

such as the Chinese Exclusion Act 

and Angel Island, the immigration 

station in San Francisco Bay 

designated to control Chinese 

entry into the U.S.

“Especially 
in 
the 
current 

climate and the blatant racism 

being spouted by so many people 

due to the current pandemic 

makes me want to learn as much 

as possible and speak out about 

this mistreatment,” Svensson said. 

“Joining this event helps me fuel 

my rage at the ways Asian people 

are being attacked for something 

which has nothing to do with 

them.” 

After her lecture, Fang opened 

the 
floor 
to 
questions 
from 

viewers. Music, Theatre & Dance 

junior Alyxandra Ciale Trinidad 

Charfauros asked Fang how to 

make activism more accessible and 

personal.

Fang responded by pointing to 

the importance of social media as a 

tool to influence people to engage 

with one another. Since she said 

she found her own voice through 

her 
blog 
Reappropriate, 
Fang 

suggested people produce their 

own media, such as art, comedy 

or any individual form of artistic 

expression. 

Through art, Fang said she 

believes people can more easily 

facilitate 
Asian 
American 

discourse 
and 
help 
activism 

become more accessible through 

technology. 

“The main advice I have to young 

people who want to get involved is 

to start thinking about the ways 

you can learn from people you are 

not currently learning from,” Fang 

said. “What every single person has 

to say is important, and amplifying 

your own voice is a radical act that 

is important, necessary and worth 

hearing.”

“

Stay safe.” It’s a phrase that’s 

becoming all too familiar in the days 

of COVID-19. My husband says it to 

me as he hugs me before I leave for work. I 

read it in texts from friends and family who 

I haven’t seen in weeks. The grocery store 

clerk utters it through a plexiglass barrier 

in the checkout line. These two words are 

a ubiquitous mantra the whole world is 

crying out in desperation.

I want to tell you all today that I am 

not safe. I am not safe because Michigan 

Medicine will not let me protect myself.

I am an ICU (intensive care unit) nurse at 

Michigan Medicine. I am one of thousands 

of front-line health care providers at the 

hospital who are faced with the impossible 

task of handling the coronavirus pandemic. 

Similar to any other health care system in 

the United States, our hospital was wholly 

unprepared to face this unprecedented 

crisis.

Personal protection gear for hospital 

workers is limited worldwide and many 

health care systems have had to adapt to 

preserve their limited supply of masks. 

Unfortunately, “The Michigan Difference” 

here is that our hospital administration 

is not only rationing protective gear but 

also prohibiting bedside staff from using 

their own personal equipment to protect 

themselves from the virus.

So much is still not understood about 

COVID-19. One of the greatest areas of 

debate is whether the disease is transmitted 

through the air or through respiratory 

droplets. For health care providers caring 

for patients, appropriate 

droplet precautions include 

a 
simple 
surgical 
face 

mask, along with a gown, 

gloves and eye shield. 

Diseases 
with 
airborne 

transmission 
can 
easily 

penetrate 
these 
masks. 

Because of this, when a 

disease is airborne, a more 

sophisticated 
respiratory 

mask is recommended such 

as an N95 or N100.

The world has only known about 

COVID-19 for a few months. Researchers 

are working around the clock to study its 

transmission. Some studies are suggesting 

the virus is airborne, but there is still not a 

definitive consensus.

The 
World 
Health 
Organization 

and Centers for Disease Control and 

Prevention both postulate that COVID-

19 transmission is primarily airborne and 

close transmission via respiratory particles 

is “uncertain.” However, the CDC has yet to 

update its recommendations and maintain 

that droplet precautions provide healthcare 

workers with adequate protection. Is 

this reluctance a product of insufficient 

evidence?

Of course, a shortage of personal 

protective gear is not a problem unique to 

Michigan Medicine. Up until recently, the 

hospital was recommending and supplying 

COVID-19 providers with N95 masks. That 

rug was pulled out from under us on March 

19 when the administration announced 

that we will now be using simple face masks 

and N95 masks will only be used in special 

circumstances.

This policy change feels alarming and 

irresponsible. The hospital administration 

has shown a profound lack of transparency 

on showing staff what data they are using 

to support this change. The change has 

left many of us panicked. Are we really 

expected to just believe that a mask will 

protect us when there is still no consensus 

on transmission?

On March 30, it was announced that, 

in anticipation of an influx of patients, a 

new staffing model would be introduced 

to address patients exceeding our current 

nursing capacity. We will all be forced 

to work 12-hour shifts, with very few 

exceptions. We will work with non-ICU 

trained nurses to care for up to 12 patients 

at a time, including several patients who are 

critically ill. This means as bedside staff, 

our exposure to this virus will increase 

exponentially, while our only protection is 

a face mask that will “probably” protect us.

Maybe it’s too much to ask for a hospital 

to provide N95 masks to all its frontline staff 

during a global crisis. The shortage of gear 

is obviously not just a Michigan problem. 

But what if I purchase my own personal 

N95 mask or reusable respirator mask 

online to use at work? Many are expensive 

and difficult to find, but perhaps the price 

is worth it when you are fearful for the 

health of yourself and your family. Henry 

Ford Health System has not only allowed 

staff to use their own personal gear but also 

has allowed staff to make their own masks 

amid the shortage.

On March 30, the Joint Commission 

released a statement supporting the use of 

health care providers utilizing their own 

personal protective equipment, saying “the 

degree to which privately-owned masks 

and respirators will increase the protection 

of health care workers is uncertain. 

However, the balance of evidence suggests 

that it is positive.”

Despite this recommendation, on April 1, 

Michigan sent a hospital-wide email saying 

they will continue to prohibit the use of 

personal protection brought from home.

The 
CDC 
has 
also 

published recommendations 

for 
ways 
to 
protect 

providers 
when 
masks 

are limited or unavailable. 

They have even gone as far 

as to say that we can use 

bandanas and scarves as 

a last resort. Yet if I have 

an N95 mask at home for 

personal use, Michigan 

says that it is not OK to 

use at work. It is frustrating how our 

administrators can pick and choose which 

recommendations they will abide by.

As health care providers, we take an 

oath to do no harm. We did not take an 

oath to stand by and allow ourselves to be 

harmed in the process.

There is a fine line between essential 

employees and sacrificial staff. This week 

it was announced that a Henry Ford 

Hospital nurse died after testing positive 

for COVID-19. Hospital administrators 

are making choices around infection 

control, but we are the ones paying the 

ultimate price.

Michigan Medicine is a respected 

leader in health care and should be setting 

an example for the rest of Southeast 

Michigan as we fight through this 

pandemic. By not allowing us to wear our 

own gear, the hospital is being negligent 

and disrespectful to every single person 

who is putting their life on the line to help 

these sick patients. We have a right to do 

anything we can to protect our lives and 

the lives of those we love without fear of 

retribution from our superiors.

Michigan Medicine, I am disappointed 

in you. You already are overwhelmed, 

understaffed and unprepared. You will 

lose some of the most brilliant medical 

professionals in the world to this disease 

if you don’t allow us to become better 

protected. Instead of telling me to stay 

safe, why don’t you give me a fighting 

chance?

Unprotected and disrespected - The Michigan Difference

I

n 
periods 
of 
societal 

uncertainty, 
individuals 

must turn to rationalism 

and self-control rather than 

relying on external factors.

It has been about 15 days since 

the reality of COVID-19 settled 

into the streets of Ann Arbor. 

Classes were canceled, Greek life 

was extinguished and students 

began packing their bags — our 

education was bookended not by 

a reflection of accomplishments 

but by an elusive and highly 

contagious 
virus. 
The 

strangeness of social distancing 

creates 
tension 
between 

boredom and intensity. In the 

blink of an eye, the traditional 

formats, 
expectations 
and 

responsibilities of our education 

have shifted. The proverbial rug 

of syllabi and deadlines has been 

yanked from beneath us, which 

feels even more jarring because 

of the United States national 

government’s delayed reaction 

(besides the immediate response 

in regards to personal stocks) to 

the virus.

Student life as we know it is 

on hold, with no clear timeline 

as to when we will shift back to 

normal. Sadly, what we know as 

normal will never be reclaimed 

after the pandemic has slowed.

It is clear the world is under 

a stage of significant transition, 

where every critical decision 

will have an immense impact 

for years to come. My family 

and I decided that it would be 

best for me to come home to 

our cottage in West Michigan, 

and while my lake view and the 

wildlife surrounding the area 

is calming, I feel the intrinsic 

motor of motivation grinding to 

a halt. Personally, as classes have 

become Pass/No Record Covid 

and my additional responsibilities 

shift online, it is difficult to not 

be swept up in the discourse 

pertaining to COVID-19. We 

have all the time in the world 

with no definitive end in sight, 

but our lives have been dictated 

by deadlines and sociality for 

our entire collegiate careers, 

so the pressure of progress and 

achievement still hovers in our 

personal quarantines. This being 

said, all societal expectations and 

sociological surges are becoming 

less important in our personal 

lives compared to the massive 

shifts in health care, policy and 

politics.

Right now, life seems to 

be 
controlled 
primarily 
by 

external factors. We rely on the 

politicians we have elected, the 

health care systems currently in 

place and late-stage capitalism 

to handle this pandemic. With 

each 
additional 
restriction, 

the underlying fear and unrest 

increases.

The protagonist of the new normal

ELIZABETH COOK | COLUMN

M

y kitchen island has 

served as a place 

where time gets lost in 

long hours of insightful conversation. 

Now, when time seems to stand still 

and daily discussions don’t steer 

far from the all-consuming, mind-

numbing coronavirus pandemic, 

I often reminisce to one of my last 

conversations 
with 
my 
college 

friends. 

We’d landed on my favorite 

discussion 
of 
all 
time: 
the 

simulation 
argument. 
The 

argument juggles the capacity of 

technological advancement with 

the probability that we are living 

in a matrix. While it’s intriguing 

to momentarily entertain such 

questions, 
philosophers 
have 

studied these kinds of thought 

experiments for centuries. The 

real-world implications of working 

through these purely imaginative 

exercises have been heavily debated 

in philosophy and science, but one 

thing many thinkers can agree on 

is their importance. By limiting an 

existing realm to either be a matrix 

or to be a technologically lagging 

society, thought experiments, like 

the simulation argument, yield clear 

intuition that can be translated into 

real-world dilemmas. While life is 

messier than a carefully crafted 

hypothetical, popular culture offers 

a medium in which we can further 

consider philosophical questions 

through movies, TV shows and 

books. 
The 
actual 
challenge, 

however, is actively engaging in the 

intelligent participation this kind 

of content calls for — and allowing 

any existential epiphanies to shape 

our perception and way of life.

Existentialism 
has 
existed 

as a prevalent theme in books 

and movies, taking the form of 

dystopian 
futures, 
dangerous 

diseases and exaggerations of 

reality, but these conversations 

often circle back to the same 

conclusion: “That’s just a big ‘what 

if,’ though.” Well, what if we didn’t 

take these interpretations lightly? 

Instead, in times like these, we 

should indulge in the uncertainty 

of existence. 

Among all the chaos it has 

already caused, a global pandemic 

serves as yet another reminder of 

the frailty of human nature, and 

as Albert Camus, author of the 

commonly revisited novel “The 

Plague,” suggests, the absurdity 

of life. Written post-World War II 

when existentialism began gaining 

popularity, Camus’s classic novel 

eerily mimics the current crisis 

and, subsequently, the potential 

lessons to be learned from it, as 

many have already connected. 

While Camus’ philosophies seemed 

purely educational when plowing 

through the 320-page book for an 

elective class, its relevance and truth 

feel unsettling in our current 

context. It’s as if hypotheticals 

in popular culture have some 

truth behind them — as if we just 

may be living in our own twisted 

episode of “Black Mirror.”

From 1999’s “The Matrix” to 

contemporary Netflix originals 

like “The Society,” TV shows 

and movies have encouraged 

us to question reality and 

contemplate our own purpose, 

though it’s not as if we’ve 

ever really needed this push. 

Feelings of existential dread, or 

intense feelings of indifference 

triggered by external stimuli, 

are common among college 

students, especially when the 

sleepless nights of studying 

never seem to be enough and 

successes are questioned at the 

first stumble. 

Embrace the existential crisis

The change has 
left many of us 

panicked.


“Parasite” made history two months 

ago (yes, two months is right — time is all 

sorts of funky in the age of corona) with its 

Best Picture win, but it certainly wasn’t the 

first non-English-language film to make 

an attempt at the Academy’s top prize. The 

twentieth century saw a number of French, 

Italian and Swedish films have a go. The year 

2000 featured Ang Lee’s martial arts epic 

“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” And it 

was only as recent as 2019 that a perhaps 

equally deserving film was in Best Picture 

contention: Alfonso Cuarón’s sublime black-

and-white Netflix flick (Netflick?) “Roma.” 

It didn’t win. But the cast and crew still 

went home happy with the awards for Best 

Foreign Language Film (since renamed Best 

International Feature), Best Director and 

Best Cinematography.

Despite falling short of the top prize, 

“Roma” is one of those rare movies that 

may have truly earned the title of “instant 

classic,” a status that is being recognized 

by the film’s recently announced inclusion 

in the Criterion Collection. As Netflix’s 

first-ever home video release, it’s set to be 

accompanied by the 72-minute making-of 

documentary “Road to Roma,” co-directed 

by Andres Clariond (“Hilda”) and Gabriel 

Nuncio (“Cumbres”). And, this being a 

Netflix shindig, it’s already on the streaming 

service for everyone’s viewing pleasure.

“Labor of love” is a phrase that gets 

thrown around a lot; in “Road to Roma,” 

we learn what exactly a labor of love looks 

like, as the documentary is largely a grand 

picking of director Cuarón’s brain. If one 

reads anything about “Roma,” they’ll learn 

that it’s a deeply personal film, a semi-

autobiographical tale of Cuarón’s childhood 

in Mexico City and an emotional ode to 

his beloved nanny Liboria Rodríguez, the 

inspiration for the film’s own protagonist 

Cleo. He goes so far as to call it his “first 

film” (an especially meaningful claim 

considering his sci-fi film “Gravity” was a 

contender for Best Picture in 2013, not to 

mention Oscar nominations for “Children of 

Men” and “Y Tu Mamá También”). In this 

light, “Road to Roma” brings the same keen 

quality of appeal that arises whenever one 

listens to someone talking about something 

they’re truly passionate about.

Cuarón definitely fits the role of the 

neurotic director — hemming and hawing 

over every angle, every set piece, every 

minute expression — and to that end, some 

might be exhausted by the eccentricities of a 

stereotypically ostentatious artist. But what 

“Road to Roma” really pounds in is that 

“Roma” is a film that set its sights beyond 

artistic quality. Cuarón’s perfectionism was 

not in service of perfection itself, but rather 

in pursuit of truth, in fidelity to Libo and to 

Mexico, plumbing the depths of his memory 

to make sure the garage tiles matched, the 

local delicatessens had the right signage, 

that even that the extras playing his 

neighbors looked at least a little similar.

It’s insights like these that proliferate in 

“Road to Roma,” as the film is largely an 

extended interview with Cuarón as he takes 

the viewer through the casting process, the 

set construction, the blocking and specific 

methods of acting and all the minutiae of 

film production. Anyone looking for sit-

downs with the film’s lead Yalitza Aparicio 

— or discussion with really any other crew 

or cast member beyond candid footage — 

will be disappointed.

Ultimately, like most making-of films, 

this movie is an “extra.” But if one was 

captivated by the grace and endurance of 

Aparicio’s Cleo and has any interest at all 

in the life and work of Alfonso Cuarón, 

then “Road to Roma” is an enlightening 

experience, augmenting rather than merely 

ornamenting the already excellent “Roma.”

‘Road to Roma,’ a moving, making-of-the-movie-type movie

FILM REVIEW

Over the course of mere days, COVID-19 has 

changed our lives in ways we never could have 

imagined. While we’ve heard countless stories of 

workers being laid off due to the economic strain 

of the stay-at-home order, musicians, who rely on 

ticket sales to pay their rent, have been relatively 

forgotten amid the madness. 

Though big artists 

who’ve made millions 

in hit records will 

probably 
make 

it 
through 
these 

uncertain 
times 

without 
incurring 

irreversible 
damage, 

“low-tier” professional 

musicians who are just 

starting their music 

careers 
have 
been 

greatly impacted by 

show 
cancellations. 

As artists who rely 

on touring to gain a 

following 
and 
who 

barely make anything from streaming, they are 

facing severe financial struggles after investing 

much of their savings into crews and equipment 

for touring, only to have all of those shows 

canceled. 

I had the opportunity to chat with Jordy 

Searcy, a folk singer/songwriter based out of 

Nashville, about the unique impact of COVID-19 

on musicians and what’s being done to support 

them during this time. As an artist working his 

way into mainstream music, Searcy has been 

supporting the Nashville music community 

by hosting livestreams on his Instagram every 

Tuesday night, with each virtual show dedicated 

to raising money for a different band. 

“I had the idea (because) I have a lot of friends 

that are touring off of their first record and they’re 

starting to make fans, but it’s really just like the 

first year of gaining some success and starting to 

sell out rooms, but still having a lot of expenses,” 

Searcy said. “A lot of my friends are the people 

that got hit the hardest because they may not have 

streaming, or online merch sales, or savings from 

a bunch of hit records saved up like a lot of other 

professional musicians do. A lot of my friends rely 

exclusively on touring for income. They rely on 

touring, but it’s like five people that rely on one 

tour to pay (each member’s) rent.” 

Last Tuesday, Searcy 

hosted a livestream to 

raise money for The 

Brook and the Bluff, a 

pop-soul band out of 

Nashville that had their 

shows canceled due to 

the virus. On top of public 

show cancellations, the 

group also had their 

private events canceled 

— which would have 

been a major source of 

income heading into the 

summer. 

“A lot of musicians 

make cash not just from 

tickets to shows, but also from unpublicized 

special events, like a high-profile wedding, or a 

bar mitzvah, or a corporate event,” Searcy said. 

“The Brook and the Bluff had a lot of big corporate 

events booked to keep them afloat through the 

summer, and all of those got canceled.”

While Searcy is an out-of-work musician 

himself, he claims he is doing well for the time 

being and wants to dedicate his time to helping the 

artists that truly need it. 

“I actually got pretty lucky because I make most 

of my income from streaming,” Searcy said. “My 

cash flow actually wasn’t affected and I’m kind of 

on a gradual rise this year anyway. I’ve been lucky 

enough to now be making a little bit more money 

than I was making even a few months ago.” 

Though Searcy is the one coordinating the 

livestreams, he believes their success comes from 

fans’ willingness to help out. 

“I’m not the one giving cash. I’m just basically 

playing a few songs, orchestrating it,” Searcy said. 

“What’s been really cool is the number of people 

watching every week has grown. The number of 

dollars that the fans give to the bands has been 

growing every week too, which has been really 

cool. It’s been really encouraging to see people 

support my friends, who I love a lot.”

On top of performing some of his own music 

and covers, Searcy invites other musicians to 

join the livestreams in an effort to get the entire 

Nashville music community involved. Searcy has 

featured the bands he’s raising money for, as well 

as outside artists like Caleb Chapman from Colony 

House, a rock band based out of Nashville, who 

played a few acoustic songs from the band’s new 

album. 

Staying true to the spirit of struggling 

musicians, Searcy films the livestreams from a van 

he recently purchased for touring. 

“We bought the van maybe a month and a 

half ago and then everything got canceled, so it’s 

basically my office now,” Searcy said. “The van 

was a touring thing and now I’ve built that out a 

little bit. I moved everything into my van, and now 

I record and write out of there.”

During his livestream dedicated to raising 

money for the band Sawyer, a female indie-

pop duo, Searcy had to pause the livestream 

periodically to talk to Mike, the stranger that was 

allowing Searcy to park his van on his property. 

About halfway through the livestream, something 

must have come up, and Mike politely asked Searcy 

to move his van, forcing him to find a new spot to 

park so he could finish the livestream. Needless to 

say, Searcy has been on a lot of adventures during 

this quarantine. 

“Last week I took (the van) out surfing for a 

while, self-quarantined in the van and surfed for 

a week, did one of the livestreams from out close 

to the beach,” Searcy said. “Now the van is parked 

in Nashville, so usually my daily routine is I drive 

out to a little secluded area like a scenic park and 

just park it and work all day in the van in my office-

studio thing, and then I drive it back home.”

As someone who loves to perform live, Searcy 

has missed the in-person interactions that can’t be 

replaced by virtual shows, but he still believes he’s 

been able to make unique connections with his 

fans through livestream concerts.

As millions of people adjust to working, learning and trying to live their normal lives from home, some jobs simply can’t be done from the confines 

of your living room. At first, being a Michigan Daily photographer seemed to be one of those jobs since all events and games had been canceled, not 

to mention social distancing prohibiting us from even leaving our houses. This means we’ve had to photograph what’s around us: quarantine. 

Most of us have been adjusting to online classes in our new workspaces at home. Some of us have taken on projects ranging from making face 

masks for local hospitals experiencing shortages to building skateboards. We’ve also been getting outside and staying active. Most importantly, we’ve 

been washing our hands, and we hope you are too!

The bond between Owen and Bryan Finnerty

Bryan Finnerty gazed across 

the table and saw himself. 

It was late last October, and 

he was out to lunch in Ann 

Arbor, in town for that night’s 

men’s soccer game between 

Michigan 
and 
Wisconsin. 

Bryan was catching up with 

one of his fraternal twin sons, 

Owen, who doubled as the 

Wolverines’ backup goalkeeper. 

Michigan had only three 

games left on its regular 

season schedule and Owen, 

a freshman, had yet to see 

the pitch. He was the backup 

to senior stalwart Andrew 

Verdi, the eventual Big Ten 

Goalkeeper of the Year. 

Bryan had been in Owen’s 

shoes 
before. 
Thirty-two 

years ago, he was a backup 

goalkeeper for San Diego State, 

slotted behind senior Felipe 

Hernandez on the depth chart. 

To begin the 1987 campaign, 

Bryan, a redshirt sophomore, 

readied for life on the bench, 

unlikely to contribute for the 

third straight season. 

Then everything changed. 

Eleven games in, Hernandez 

fell victim to a broken leg in an 

ugly collision during practice, 

thrusting 
Bryan 
into 
the 

starting lineup. 

Bryan took his opportunity 

and ran with it. In his first 

game in the net against rival 

San Diego, he anchored a 2-0 

shutout win. He steered the 

Aztecs all the way to the NCAA 

Tournament final, the first 

chapter in what would become 

a successful 13-year career 

that spanned the collegiate 

and professional ranks on the 

National Professional Soccer 

League’s Detroit Rockers. 

So as Bryan looked at Owen, 

whose lack of playing time 

made redshirting a possibility, 

he had just one message to 

relay: be ready. 

“Most guys just shut it down 

mentally at that point,’’ Bryan 

said. “They’re just done, ready 

for next year. But what if the 

coach looks down the bench 

and says it’s time for you to 

go in? Do you say yes or no? 

Without hesitation, Owen goes 

‘Yes, for sure. I’m taking every 

chance I can get. I’m ready for 

it. I’m ready to go.’ ” 

That 
evening 
against 

Wisconsin, Verdi suffered an 

injury that forced him out of the 

game. Owen was summoned. 

“Hearing my Dad’s story 

so many times before, I think 

I was prepared in a way that 

I knew I needed to be ready 

because my Dad always told me 

to be ready,” Owen said. “I put 

myself in the right mental place, 

the always be ready aspect.”

Verdi’s injury proved to be 

season-ending; the reins to the 

net were now Owen’s. He didn’t 

miss a beat. 

In his first collegiate start, 

he shut out rival Michigan 

State, 2-0, much like Bryan 

did against San Diego all those 

years earlier. He piloted the 

Wolverines on a run in the 

NCAA Tournament — just as 

Bryan had done with his Aztecs 

— ending in the Sweet Sixteen.

Like father, like son. 

Said Bryan: “You just can’t 

script it.”

***

A 
sobering 
predicament 

faces kids pursuing a sport 

in which one of their parents 

found success. Every day of 

their childhood, they confront a 

reminder of all they have yet to 

achieve. Some aspiring athletes 

crumble under the pressure, 

engulfed by their parent’s 

shadow. Others opt for a more 

auspicious outlook. 

Owen always viewed his 

Dad as a beacon of possibility, 

not a towering wall of his own 

unfulfilled expectations. 

“I felt a drive, almost like 

I wanted to experience my 

dreams to play professional 

soccer and collegiate soccer and 

take the game as far as I can,” 

Owen said. “Having a Dad who 

did the same thing I wanted to 

do, that inspired me to do that 

as well. I knew it was feasible.”

From an early age, Owen 

grew cognizant of his Dad’s 

soccer career. He watched old 

tapes of Rockers games, seeing 

his Dad shine in goal against his 

adversaries.

It was through these films 

that Owen got a sense of who 

his Dad was as a goalkeeper. 

“Watching 
the 
games, 

not a lot of (my actions) were 

censored out back then,” Bryan 

remembered, laughing. “Owen 

would go, ‘Dad are you cussing 

there? Are you yelling that?’ It 

was just the intensity I played 

with. He grew to understand 

that, when you’re on that side of 

the touchline, you should have 

that level of intensity that the 

game deserves and needs.”

Playing with that vigor is 

a requisite for goalkeepers, 

perhaps more so than it is for 

other positions. Manning the 

net comes with the utmost 

pressure — being the last 

line of defense, the boundary 

between win and loss and often 

the scapegoat for the latter. 

Accordingly, goalkeepers, the 

good ones, have trademarked 

characteristics. 
They 
are 

dogged, 
unshakable. 
Bryan 

calls it a “bravery chip.”

It’s a trait that’s been visible 

in Owen since he was 13, 

only a year after he took up 

goalkeeping full-time. 

It was the 2014 State Cup 

final and he got peppered 

with shots, his team vastly 

outmatched. In the first half 

alone, he made 15 saves and 

allowed just one goal. 

In the halftime huddle, 

Owen inspired. 

“He comes in and just 

pumps the guys up,” Bryan 

recalled. “It’s a spot where most 

goalkeepers want to be in a shell 

and crawl under a rock, cause 

they know that’s coming in the 

second half. He just showed 

a lot of moxie, to have what it 

takes between gears to be able 

to get scored on and still bounce 

back and have that resolve. I 

remember thinking to myself 

he’s got it, he’s got that chip.”

Owen 
and 
Bryan’s 

similarities in the net go beyond 

the chip. They share the same 

charisma and demeanor, that 

fervor. They’re both risk-takers 

and have a knack for making 

the big save. Hard work runs in 

Finnerty blood — “control the 

controllable” is a family mantra.

And Owen’s career path, 

rather eerily, continues to 

resemble that of his father. 

Last May, Owen stood out 

on the turf field at Keyworth 

Stadium, the home venue for his 

new team, Detroit City FC. The 

stands were filled with those 

Bryan 
labels 
“generational 

fans” of Detroit soccer. It’s a 

vibrant community that didn’t 

exist when he played for the 

Rockers. The ‘90s marked 

an era where the fans, while 

devoted, 
were 
novice 
and 

limited in number. 

Bryan has long been a fixture 

in Detroit’s soccer community. 

He won over followers with 

stellar play on the field and 

activism off it, making routine 

appearances at schools and 

camps. When his career ended 

in 
2000, 
his 
involvement 

didn’t cease. Along with his 

wife, Denise, he launched 

Opportunity Seed, a nonprofit 

program designed to stimulate 

soccer in the area and assist 

younger players. 

On that May evening, Bryan 

found himself caught up in 

the moment. He looked on 

as his son signed autographs 

for a fanbase he cultivated. 

Owen lacing up to play on a 

field he laid the groundwork 

for. He couldn’t help but get 

emotional. 

Here was Owen, literally 

following in his doting father’s 

footsteps. 

***

All father-son relationships 

evolve over time. And along 

the way, all have their ups and 

downs. Sports have a way of 

surfacing these tensions. 

The Finnertys were never 

exempt from any of this. Bryan 

and Owen’s relationship has 

had its strains, for which the 

dinner table was the usual 

stomping ground. 

“There were plenty of times 

where I thought I knew better, 

and Owen thought he knew 

better, which led to some pretty 

spirited discussions,” Bryan 

said. “You know, where as a 

Dad who might have grown 

up playing hockey and then 

Owen played soccer, I probably 

wouldn’t have had as much of 

an opinion.”

Gradually, their relationship 

has matured. It’s taken effort 

on both sides. 

Bryan, who coached Owen 

in his early playing days, has 

acclimated to a more hands-

off approach. He’s learned to 

embrace the life of a spectator, 

as someone who can’t affect 

the outcome of the game any 

longer.

Owen, 
meanwhile, 
has 

grown to appreciate everything 

his Dad has brought to the 

table, learning it’s often best 

to heed to Dad’s wisdom. In 

hindsight, he realizes just how 

fortunate he’s been to have a 

former goalkeeper around all 

the time.

“I just love when he watches 

me,” Owen said. “And having 

him to coach me and kinda 

show me what he could show 

me. Especially as a young kid, 

to be exposed to someone like 

that, it was huge. Just having 

him to talk to all the time and 

ask questions, to have him by 

my side all the time was huge 

for my growth and knowledge 

of my game.”

Their bond extends beyond 

the soccer pitch. The two share 

many of the same passions and 

cherish the times when they’re 

not talking about soccer at 

all, the “guy time” — fishing, 

surfing, golfing. 

“I 
think 
through 
that 

goalie-to-goalie, 
dad-to-son 

relationship, it created a lot 

of space for us to build many 

other relationships, which has 

just been really cool,” Bryan 

said. “Certainly, soccer has 

made us closer. I’ll go back 

to the conversations at the 

dinner table. To me, that’s like 

any relationship. It’s tough to 

have your relationship grow if 

you don’t have those healthy 

contention 
points 
where 

you’re challenging each other. 

Not only did it give us time 

to communicate with each 

other about soccer, but also to 

communicate about life.”

***

In Owen’s second start as a 

Wolverine, Michigan hit the 

road to take on No. 17 Maryland. 

As the last contest of the 

regular season, the match had 

major implications on seeding 

for the impending Big Ten 

Tournament and a potential 

NCAA Tournament bid. 

With under a minute to 

play, the Wolverines nursed 

a 3-2 lead. The Terrapins 

had 
possession 
and 
in 
a 

quickly developing play found 

themselves on the lip of Owen’s 

18-yard-box. As a Maryland 

forward ripped a screaming 

shot 
toward 
the 
top-right 

corner of the net, Owen 

propelled himself into the air. 

He punched the ball away 

with his right fist, denying the 

equalizer with a highlight-reel 

save. 

Michigan held on to win, 4-2. 

After the game, Owen made 

a beeline for the stands to greet 

a beaming Bryan. 

“To just go over there, 

hugging him as a fan, I think 

that was a great moment for 

both of us,” Owen said. “It felt 

like a lot came together in that 

moment. I’ll never forget that 

one.”

“That Maryland moment, it 

was culminating,” Bryan said. 

“A critical point in the season, 

as a young player when you’re 

still being tested. To make that 

save, I was just taken aback. It 

was kinda like, man, he did that.

“And I was just so, so proud.”

It is the case, even outside 

the realm of sportswriters like 

myself, that students often 

remember 

their 

time 
at 

Michigan 

through 

the 

snapshot 

of sports. 

Questions 

like, 

“Where 

were you when Poole hit the 

shot?” both capture a moment 

in 
time 
and 
a 
nostalgic 

reverence for the past. We get 

that brief rush of dopamine 

thinking back to a single 

moment of joy. Who did we 

hug? What did we do? Who 

climbed that light pole on 

South U?

Students graduating this 

year — or whatever word we 

choose — have seen a four-year 

span packed with Michigan 

sports success, maybe more 

so than any crop of graduates 

since … the late-90s? The early 

90s? Earlier?

There 
were 
iconic 

moments, legendary athletes, 

historic runs and unexpected 

twists. There was a shot, a 

frozen dagger, a gut-punch 

in the pouring rain. There 

was heartbreak — oh, plenty 

of that. A loss at Kinnick. 

Inches of a football separating 

triumph and tumult. Titles 

and 
near 
titles. 
Surprise 

postseason runs. Coaching 

changes we expected and 

coaching changes that seemed 

unfathomable.

But 
let’s 
not 
get 
too 

far ahead of ourselves. I 

picked 
eight. 
Your 
eight 

might be different. We’re 

all susceptible to our own 

biases. But here are the eight 

moments, runs, games and 

events that will define how I 

remember our four years on 

this campus. I’d love to hear

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Michigan guard David 

DeJulius plans to enter the 

transfer portal, according 

to a program spokesperson. 

The news was first broken 

by 
Josh 
Henschke 
of 

247Sports.

A 
former 
four-star 

recruit from Detroit in 2018, 

DeJulius played sparingly as 

a freshman before taking on 

a bigger role this past season. 

He averaged 7.0 points on 

42 percent shooting this 

past season and started 

in place of senior guard 

Zavier Simpson during the 

Wolverines’ trip to Lincoln 

in January.

DeJulius, 
who 
was 

recruited 
by 
former 

Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein, 
seemed 
to 
be 

adjusting 
well 
to 
the 

beginning of the Juwan 

Howard era in Ann Arbor. 

On Dec. 2, DeJulius praised 

Howard’s open door policy.

“You can just walk into 

his office at any time of 

the day and just talk about 

anything,” DeJulius said. 

“It doesn’t even have to 

be about basketball. A lot 

of times, he’ll pull you in 

and talk to you and it won’t 

have nothing to do with 

basketball, 
‘How’s 
your 

family? How are you? How’s 

school? How are you doing 

mentally?’ ”

In a conversation during 

January, DeJulius echoed 

a similar sentiment after 

the two met for breakfast at 

Sava’s on State Street.

“No matter the time of 

day, you can hit him up,” 

DeJulius told The Daily. 

“Just to know you have a 

coach that’s been through 

what you’ve been through, 

you’re able to relate to him 

and he’s able to relate to you. 

It’s a very good feeling to go 

out there and play for him.”

Even 
beyond 
Howard, 

DeJulius was outspoken in 

his ability to connect with 

the rest of the stuff. In 

particular, he bonded with 

assistant 
coach 
Howard 

Eisley over their shared 

Detroit roots.

“(Eisley) was like an OG 

from the city,” DeJulius 

said in February, “But now 

he came in and now he’s my 

coach, so I’m just going to 

embrace it. He had a great 

career in the NBA so I’m 

just trying to pick (up) as 

much knowledge from him 

as I can. We connected, just 

both being from Detroit. 

Being from the inner city, 

just seeing the type of life 

he made for himself and 

his family, how he conducts 

himself on and off the court, 

and me (being) inspired to 

get to the level he’s on. We 

just kind of connected from 

that standpoint.”

Given 
the 
Wolverines’ 

five public class of 2020 

commitments, attrition was 

always going to be inevitable. 

But with Michigan in strong 

contention for class of 2020 

five-star 
shooting 
guard 

Josh 
Christopher 
and 

Harvard graduate transfer 

Bryce 
Aiken, 
perhaps 

DeJulius’ departure boils 

down to a desire for playing 

time. He’s shown enough 

in his time at Michigan to 

draw national high-major 

interest.

And 
now, 
with 
his 

decision 
to 
transfer 

expected to become official 

later this week, DeJulius 

will finish out his remaining 

two 
years 
of 
eligibility 

elsewhere.

What was already likely 

to be a revamped Michigan 

men’s 
basketball 
roster 

heading into next season 

became 
even 
more 
so 

Monday afternoon with the 

announcement that guard 

David DeJulius had entered 

the transfer portal. 

A 
Detroit 
native, 

DeJulius was in line to 

compete for the starting 

point guard job following 

the departure of senior 

Zavier Simpson. Instead, 

DeJulius 
will 
complete 

his two remaining years of 

eligibility elsewhere. 

DeJulius’s 

announcement 
comes 
as 

somewhat of a surprise 

given 
his 
reportedly 

strong relationships with 

first-year 
coach 
Juwan 

Howard 
and 
assistants 

Phil Martelli and Howard 

Eisley. DeJulius was one 

of the first players off the 

bench for the Wolverines, 

averaging 
20.9 
minutes 

across all 31 games and even 

started against Nebraska on 

Jan. 28 following Simpson’s 

one-game suspension. At 

times, DeJulius provided a 

jolt of much-needed energy 

and even amidst struggles, 

displayed a certain bravado 

and confidence. 

“At 
my 
position, 
if 

I’m hitting shots, good,” 

DeJulius 
said 
back 
in 

November. “Each and every 

night, I can’t have a night off, 

where I’m not rebounding 

or where I’m not guarding. 

That’s gonna keep me on 

the floor. Hitting shots just 

adds to that. But, at the very 

least, I’m going to give my 

teammates all I can on the 

defensive end and in the 

muscle areas.” 

But, even with Simpson 

and 
center 
Jon 
Teske 

departing 
and 
junior 

forward 
Isaiah 
Livers 

testing 
the 
NBA 
Draft 

waters, 
an 
offseason 

transfer 
or 
two 
was 

probable. On top of bringing 

center Austin Davis back 

on a fifth-year scholarship, 

Michigan will usher in a 

loaded 
2020 
recruiting 

class of five commits. Five-

star guard Josh Christopher 

may add to that number 

with 
an 
announcement 

in the coming weeks. The 

Wolverines are also in the 

running for sought-after 

graduate transfers Bryce 

Aiken of Harvard and Mike 

Smith of Columbia — both 

point guards. Once all those 

questions 
are 
answered, 

Michigan 
will 
need 
to 

come away with just 13 

scholarship players.

DeJulius 
has 
yet 
to 

speak publicly about his 

decision, but guaranteed 

playing time likely factored 

into 
the 
equation. 
The 

addition of Aiken or Smith 

to 
Michigan’s 
backcourt 

would 
undoubtedly 

jeopardize that prospect. 

As for now though, his 

exit means rising senior 

Eli Brooks will have to 

shoulder 
much 
of 
the 

burden, 
both 
from 
an 

offensive and leadership 

perspective. Brooks started 

alongside Simpson at the 

“2” last season but served as 

the backup point guard the 

two years prior. 

Brooks 
enjoyed 

somewhat of a breakout 

junior 
season 
under 

Howard, 
averaging 
10.6 

points and shooting 36.4 

percent from deep. He also 

was the Wolverines’ best 

perimeter defender. 

“A lot of people overlook 

Eli,” 
Livers 
said 
after 

Michigan’s February win 

over Michigan State. “I 

honestly 
hate 
when 
he 

guards me in practice. You 

can’t come off any ball 

screens, you can’t drive. He 

doesn’t give up any angles. 

He told me his dad taught 

him that at a young age, so 

that’s why he’s so excellent 

at it now.”

From 
a 
production 

standpoint, Brooks is more 

than capable of stepping 

into a primary role. Dubbed 

“the silent assassin” by 

teammates, Brooks is not 

the vocal presence that 

Simpson or even DeJulius 

was. Whether he likes it 

or not, now Brooks has to 

assume more of that role — 

especially if Livers opts to 

leave. 

Brooks, Davis, freshman 

standout 
Franz 
Wagner 

and versatile sophomore 

forward 
Brandon 
Johns 

Jr. will all have significant 

roles next season for the 

Wolverines. Accompanying 

a premature and abrupt 

offseason 
though, 
are 

a 
number 
of 
questions 

yet to be answered: Will 

Livers return for his senior 

season? Who else might 

transfer? Will Christopher 

join a stacked 2020 class? 

Can Michigan land Aiken or 

Smith? And, what does the 

rotation look like heading 

into next season?

DeJulius’s 
transfer 

announcement is just the 

first of many dominoes still 

to fall.

David DeJulius will enter the transfer portal, a program spokesperson confirmed to The Daily.

2019: John Beilein leaves 

for the Cleveland Cavaliers

I’d imagine if you’d taken 

an on-campus approval poll 

of every athletic figure at the 

school (addendum: someone 

should do this), Beilein likely 

would have ranked highest. 

People inside and outside 

the program knew him to 

be a good person. And most 

importantly, he won — a lot. 

He singlehandedly made a 

program relevant at a school 

that prioritized football first, 

second and third. He never 

recruited quite as well as 

you’d hoped; by the end, he 

made you a truther in that 

philosophy, anyway.

For those not plugged into 

Beilein’s 
inner-circle, 
the 

departure came as a shock. 

That ship seemed to have 

sailed for a 66-year-old college 

basketball lifer to gamble 

on a professional job, in the 

unlikely event one would 

even surface. But he did. On 

a random May morning, a 

single tweet from Adrian 

Wojnarowski 
sent 
ripples 

from Ann Arbor to Cleveland 

and beyond.

His departure also marked 

an inflection point in the 

trajectory of the program. 

Could the infrastructure he 

built sustain his departure? 

Would interest around the 

program wane?

Early signs are eminently 

positive 
on 
both 
fronts, 

though far from a closed book. 

In other words: it should speak 

volumes about his successor 

that when Beilein’s tenure 

with the Cleveland Cavaliers 

petered out, there wasn’t 

even the slightest suggestion 

that Michigan should try to 

rekindle the flame.

That doesn’t make that 

single moment — the kind that 

triggered double- and triple-

takes — any less startling.

2018: 
Jordan 
Poole’s 

miracle shot

Much has been written 

about this, so much of it is 

really, really good. There is one 

thing that I think routinely 

gets overlooked, though.

Put yourself in the shoes 

of Muhammad Ali Abdur-

Rahkman in this moment. 

Your college career, one which 

not only ranks among the 

best in program history, but 

which has never received the 

credit it deserves, hangs in the 

balance. This play is for you — 

the same play they ran against 

Minnesota 
earlier 
in 
the 

season to get him to the free-

throw line and force overtime. 

You should be the hero.

The ball is in your hands. 

The clock is dwindling. You 

catch the ball at midcourt, 

begin to dribble and hear this 

voice belting your name. You 

have to make this split-second 

decision: keep dribbling and 

try to get this yourself, as 

roughly 99 percent of college 

basketball 
players 
in 
his 

spot would, or pass to the 

freshman who had yet to take 

a shot all game, made just five 

of his 19 shots in the Big Ten 

Tournament 
and 
averaged 

just over 12 minutes per game.

It’s easy to imagine a 

scenario 
where 
Poole’s 

wayward attempt bricks rim, 

Michigan packs up a roller-

coaster season and Abdur-

Rahkman 
spends 
years 

regretting giving up the ball 

at all.

The shot, of course, went in.

Pandemonium ensued. The 

bench went nuts. Skeeps lost 

its mind. Students flooded 

the streets. Poole became 

an instant legend. Michigan 

made the National Title Game. 

The rest is history.

There are plenty of ways to 

dissect this play from Poole’s 

perspective. But man, that’s 

also an astounding display of 

faith from Abdur-Rahkman, 

a habitually selfless basketball 

player. Let’s not lose sight of 

that. 

(Oh, it also gave us the 

single most iconic image in 

Michigan Daily history.)

2019: 
Bakich 
leads 

insurgent Michigan team to 

College World Series

They just kept winning. 

The Wolverines entered the 

Big Ten Tournament unsure 

if they’d even make the 

NCAA 
Tournament. 
They 

did. The won their Regional. 

They beat Texas Tech, then 

Florida State, then Texas 

Tech again. There were folk 

heroes, like Jimmy Kerr and 

Tommy Henry. There was 

late-inning magic. At some 

point, those of us who believe 

in 
whimsical 
things 
like 

“destiny” in sports couldn’t 

help but feel this was it. 

Suddenly, coach Erik Bakich, 

the disciple, was staring down 

Vanderbilt coach, Tim Corbin, 

the master, with a chance at 

college baseball glory. Quietly, 

Bakich took a middling Big 

Ten program and made it 

a 
model 
for 
midwestern 

baseball 
during 
the 
last 

four years. And I say quiet, 

knowing that emergence from 

subtlety probably came earlier 

than expected. 

The Wolverines came just 

short, of course, losing Game 

Three of the College World 

Series to the Commodores, 

8-2. But the run put Michigan 

baseball on the map, locally 

and nationally, in a way it 

hasn’t been in quite awhile.

2017: Michigan loses to 

Michigan State, fans have 

fun anyway

Time to get on a bit of a 

soapbox. If you crowdsourced 

the entire senior class, I bet a 

plurality would point to this 

game as their single favorite 

sports moment in college. 

They’ll tell you about how 

the rain actually energized 

everyone. They’ll pull out 

their iPhone, pull up the 

link of everyone singing Mr. 

Brightside. And that’s cool.

They 
leave 
out 
one 

convenient fact: This is one 

of the worst losses of the 

Harbaugh era to date!
