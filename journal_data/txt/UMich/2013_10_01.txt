programs affected
by gov't closures
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily NewsEditor
Now that the government has
shut down, the Ann Arbor and
University community are pre-
paring for the consequences of a
reduced government.
The University's three ROTC
programs - Army, Naval and
Air Force - are programs of the
Department of Defense, which is
affected by the shutdown.
Captain Joseph Evans, Naval
ROTC commanding officer and
chair of the Naval Officer Educa-
tion Program, said the possible
impact on students in the pro-
gram would depend on how long
the shutdown lasts.
Evans said there would be no
immediate, "outwardly visible"
effects, as most issues would be
dealt with internally. He noted

that at least three members of his
staff would be furloughed, but
the rest are military employees
who would not be affected.
He noted that in the long term,
the students' scholarships could
be in jeopardy, but those details
are not clear.
Officials at the University's
Army and Air Force ROTC pro-
grams could not be reached for
comment.
Federal agencies postpone
recruiting visits
Several government agencies
have also notified the Career
Center that they would no longer
be sending recruitment officials
to the Career Expo on Oct. 1 and
Oct. 2. The State Department and
the National Security Agency,
which were also holding separate
events with University depart-
ments, cancelled their presen-
tations and notified the Career
Center.

By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
City Councilmember Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) has begun
the petitioning process to become
a candidate for the mayor of Ann
Arbor in 2014.
Kunselman - who is an employee
in the University's Energy Manage-
ment Office - went to the City Clerk
Friday to obtain the petition to be
nominated as a candidate in the
Democratic Party. He is currently
in the middle of his third term as a
council member in Ward 3, having
first been elected in 2006.
Even though the deadline for the
primary-election petition is mid-
May, Kunselman said he typically
likes to start his campaign process
early, adding that he is "not a typical
candidate."
Kunselman said he wants to
change the political culture in Ann
Arbor and increase transparency.
"I very much believe in good pub-
lic policy and budget priorities that
serve a broader element of our com-
munity rather than what we've seen
in the last few years if the direction
of our city is to be basically focused
on downtown," Kunselman said.

SACUA members
seek greater
administrative
transparency
By EMILIE PLESSET
For The Daily
Martha Pollack, Univer-
sity provost and executive
vice president for academic
affairs, made an appearance
at the Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs
meeting Monday, discussing
goals for recruitment, col-
lege affordability and funding
allocations.
At the meeting, Pollack
reflected on her first few
months as provost and dis-
cussed upcoming initiatives
to improve various aspects on

campus, including improved
education, a more diverse
student culture, college
affordability and research
enterprise.
During the meeting, mem-
bers also discussed changes
in benefits and salaries and
asked for more transparency
from committees discussing
these changes.
To improve campus inclu-
sion, Pollack said she's in the
early stages of working on a
new recruitment program for
community-college students.
According to Pollock, the
program would "strengthen
(the University's) ties to com-
munity colleges and expand
student support services" and
is a "really good way to try
and tackle" what she says is a
diversity problem.
SACUA also discussed
ways to allocate resources,

and how to keep college
affordable for students while
still ensuring departments
receive their appropriate
funds.
"We have a huge array of
programs on campus that are
intended to address diver-
sity on campus," Pollack said.
"What we need to do is figure
out which oneswe want to put
more resources into."
According to Pollock, over
the past year, average stu-
dent-loan burden decreased
by $500 and out-of-state stu-
dents saw their amount of
need-based aid double. Addi-
tionally, in 2012 University
had the lowest in-state tuition
increase in the past 30 years.
"College affordability con-
tinues to be a top priority,"
Pollack said. "We still have
a lot farther to go, but if you

Washington Woman

LSA and Public Policy Prof
Edie Goldenberg was director
of the Public Policy School from
1987 to 1989 and the dean of LSA
from 1989 to 1998. Goldenberg is
the founding director of the Mich-
igan in Washington Program,
which is in its eighth year.
What attracted you to
political science?
As a sophomore, I took a
wonderful course that made
me switch majors from math
to political science. It was an
interdisciplinary social science
class team-taught by four dis-
tinguished senior leaders in a
newly established Department
of Political Science at MIT. One
of them, Ithiel de Sola Pool,

became my adviser, and my
interest in the field just kept
growing. Michigan's Political
Science Department is one of
the very best in the world. Being
part of it has only enhanced my
interest in the field. Ever since
coming to Ann Arbor, I have
been involved in both Political
Science and the Ford School.
What is your role as the direc-
tor of the Michigan in Wash-
ington program?
I am responsible for pro-
gram design, requirements,
and evaluation; curriculum;
student recruitment, selection,
preparation and recognitions;
faculty and staff selection and
evaluation; program budget,

including student scholarships,
fundraising and development
of opportunities for program
enrichment.
All of this requires teamwork
and we have a great program
team, including staff in Ann
Arbor and in Washington, D.C.,
a faculty advisory committee,
an advisory board in D.C., stu-
dent volunteers and program
ambassadors, advisors and stu-
dent-oriented staff, key faculty
and deans in various schools

Monday afternoon and blamed
the unrest on elements close
to Col. Youssouf Traore, who
has had a strained relationship
with Sanogo. Coulibaly said the
soldiers accused Col. Mohamed
Elhabib Diallo of taking their

were to be promoted.
However, another Malian
military official said that Diallo
had been wounded by gunfire
after the angry soldiers took
him hostage.
The tensions on several
fronts underscore the enor-
mous challenges for new Mali-
an President Ibrahim Boubacar
Keita, who took office in Sep-
tember after winning the elec-
tion in an August runoff. In
an acknowledgement of those
obstacles, Keita has made rec-
onciliation a priority for his
new government, even naming
a minister responsible for the
effort and for developing the
north.
Talks were to resume
between the two sides in Burki-
na Faso later this year. How-
ever, the rebels accused the
government of failing to make
good on its promises under the
deal.
Separatist sentiment remains
high in Kidal, and the presence
of the Malian soldiers since
June has been highly contro-
versial.
Tuaregs in northern Mali
have sought autonomy dating
back to the country's indepen-
dence from France in 1960. The
government has put down sev-
eral rebellions over the years,
though the one sparked in
early 2012 allowed separatists
to make their greatest gains to
date.
After the March 2012 coup
in the capital, al-Qaida-linked
jihadists also sought to control
northern Mali and temporar-
ily sidelined the separatist reb-
els. After a French-led military
intervention ousted the radical
Islamic militants from power,
though, the NMLA began reas-
serting itself in Kidal.

NC challenges new
election law
North Carolina's Republican
governor is vowing to fight a law-
suit by the U.S. Justice Depart-
ment challenging the state's
tough new elections law on the
grounds it disproportionately
excludes minority voters.
Gov. Pat McCrory said Mon-
day he has hired a private lawyer
to help defend the new law from
what he suggested was a parti-
san attack by President Barack
Obama's Democratic administra-
tion.
"I believe the federal govern-
ment action is an overreach and

without merit," McCrory said at
a brief media conference during
which he took no questions. "I
firmly believe we have done the
right thing. I believe this is good
law."

Congo refugee
numbers swell
A new U.N. report says the
number of refugees fleeing the
war in Congo swelled by more
than 350,000 in just the past few
months as fighting escalated,
pushing the number of people
uprooted in the long-running con-
flict to 3 million.
The Congo conflict is a spill-
over from the 1994 genocide in
neighboring Rwanda. Hundreds
of Hutus who participated in the
mass slaughter escaped into Congo
and still fight there. Fighting has
continued over two decades.
The report to the Security
Council released Monday said
that as of the end of August, about
440,000 Congolese had become
refugees in neighboring Burundi,
Rwanda and Uganda. A report
three months ago put that number
at 70,000.

INSURANCE
From Page 1
GradCare plan currently covers
5,900 students, including gradu-
ate student instructors, gradu-
ate student staff assistants,
graduate student research assis-
tants, benefit-eligible fellow-
ship holders and benefit-eligible
medical students.
While enrollment data for
the fall has yet to be released,
combined graduate and profes-
sional student enrollment has
exceeded 14,000 in each of the
past three years, meaning that
GradCare likely covers less than
half of that.
For those outside the Grad-
Carenetwork,thereare avariety
of options: The University offers
the Domestic Student Health
Insurance Plan to graduate and
doctoral students who are com-
pleting requirements. Graduate
or professional students may be
able to become insured through
their parents if they are under
age 26, or through a spouse. The
deadline to enroll in DSHIP for
the fall semester was Septem-
ber 23, and uninsured students
were encouraged by University
Health Services to enroll if they
wanted insurance that could be
used sooner than offerings on
the marketplace.
Business graduate stu-
dent Tiffani Bender decided
that DSHIP's $3,284-per-year
premium was too expensive,
instead opting to see if market-
place options would be cheaper.
Though exact costs have yet
to be released, the marketplace
will offer four plans: bronze, sil-
ver, gold and platinum.
A consumer who purchases
the bronze plan would pay the
cheapest monthly premium, but
would also bear roughly 40 per-
cent of out-of-pocket costs - the

highest proportion of any plan.
Someone on the platinum plan
would pay the highest monthly
premium rate, but would be
responsible for only 10 percent
of out-of-pocket costs.
Each plan provides the same
set of essential benefits, includ-
ing doctor visits, emergency ser-
vices and prescriptions, but the
more expensive options could
include additional services.
UHS director Robert Win-
field, the University's chief
health officer, said that the Uni-
versity's health coverage most
resembles the silver plan in
terms of its proportion of cov-
ered to out-of-pocket costs - sil-
ver leaves patients responsible
for 30 percent of out-of-pocket
costs, while University policy-
holders pay roughly 28 percent.
Although the gold and
platinum plans offered on the
marketplace cover a greater pro-
portion of costs, Winfield said
the University health plan cov-
ers a broader range of pharmacy
benefits and physical-therapy
services.
"The University's benefits
for those non-essential cov-
ered items are for the most part
going to be better than most of
the insurances offered on the
exchange," Winfield said.
Despite all of the atten-
tion given to the marketplace,
another component of the ACA
may be more relevant for the
uninsured University popula-
tion: Medicaid expansion. This
provision gives states the option
of expanding Medicaid eligibil-
ity to 133 percent of the federal
poverty level, all at the federal
government's expense.
Gov. Rick Snyder signed Med-
icaid expansion into law in Sep-
tember, but the Republican-led
state Senate did not grant the
bill immediate effect, meaning
it won't be implemented until

late March or April. Tempo-
rary University employees and
uninsured graduate or profes-
sional students may qualify for
Medicaid because of the income
eligibility expansion, which
makes individuals with income
of roughly $15,000 or a family
of four with roughly $31,000 in
income eligible.
Implementation aside, Win-
field said one of the biggest chal-
lenges will be helping people
figure out all of their options
between the federally-run
insurance marketplace and the
state-run Medicaid program.
"I think it's just a great exam-
ple of the struggle between
federalism and states' rights,"
Winfield said. "(There is) com-
promise after compromise
which leads to more and more
confusion."
Consumers and health
administrators share this con-
fusion. For people like Bender,
the Business graduate student
who left a job in advertising at
McCann Worldgroup to return
to school, the insurance mar-
ketplace allows people to learn
more about their options, but all
that information can be hard to
comprehend.
"When I got (insurance)
through my employer, it was
almost like a black box: You pay
a premium every month, you
know when you go to the doc-
tor you may or may not have a
certain copay, or if you needed
prescriptions you'd know if it's
covered," Bender said. "I'm 26;
I've had health insurance my
whole life, but now I feel like I'm
just learning about it, because
now it's being put in my control."
It is unclear how the govern-
ment shutdown early Tuesday
morning will affect the Mar-
ketplace, but it appears the pro-
gram will open for enrollment
as planned.

A Career Center official said
most of the time the center is
unaware of cancellations until
they don't show up for their
scheduled time.
Students in Washington, D.C.
affected by shutdown
Students in D.C. for the Michi-
gan in Washington semester are
still largely unaware of whether
they should attend their intern-
ships in the morning.
Of the 23 students in D.C., 11 are
working in government intern-
ships, according to Margaret
Howard, MIW program manager
in Washington, D.C. Howard said
so far one student has been told to
stay home and four students have
been notified that they should to
go to work.
Though the shutdown may be
a lost day of work for some stu-
dents, LSA and Public Policy Prof.
Edie Goldenberg, who is also the
director of Michigan in Washing-
ton, said the shutdown should be a
good lesson.
"They are going to learn quite
a bit about how the government
does or doesn't function," Gold-
enberg said. "Mainly, we are
interested in them learning while
they're there, and this is going to
be a very educational experience
for all of them."
LSA senior Andy Craft, a cur-
rent MichiganinWashingtonpar-
ticipant, said his internship with
government access TV network
C-SPAN would not be directly

affected by the government shut-
down. However, he said the shut-
down would limit his ability to do
his job, as C-SPAN covers many
government-sponsored events.
In a meeting Friday, Craft said
MIW officials discussed plans to
set up walking tours and other
activities should the government
shutdown last throughout the
week.
"All the monuments and muse-
ums will be closed, so there won't
be anythingto do anyways," Craft
said.
Craft said it has been a "tumul-
tuous semester" with the Navy
Yard shooting closing down some
students' workplaces, and now
the government shutdown could
further impede work.
"This city never sleeps for
sure," he said.
Transportation, veteran care
and financial aid
Airports and Amtrak - includ-
ing the station in Ann Arbor -
are among the systems that will
remain open, the Washington
Post reported.
Derek Atkinson, spokesperson
for Veteran Affairs Ann Arbor
Health System, said the hospital's
operations will not be affected,
regardless of the shutdown.
The Post also reported that
Pell Grants and Federal Direct
Student Loans will continue to
be processed, although payments
may slow as there may be fewer
employees to process them. Other
grants previously approved by the
Department of Education, such
as Race to the Top, Investing in
Innovation and Promise Neigh-
borhoods will also continue to be
distributed.

REPORT
From Page 1
2011 to 16 in 2012.
Burglaries reported have
increased steadily over the last
several years with 68 reported
in 2012 and 60 reported in 2011.
Larcenies on campus - such as
laptop thefts - in 2012 added
up to 734, compared to 617 in
2011.
Statistics also show that
alcohol-related crimes, such as
Minor in Possession of Alcohol,
have also increased in recent
years.

The report discloses both
alcohol-related crimes handled
by police organizations and alle-
gations handled internally by
the University. In 2012, the state
of Michigan adopted a medical
amnesty law which gives stu-
dents the ability to seek medical
help for excessive alcohol con-
sumption without facing legal
repercussions. However, the
law does not prohibit the Uni-
versity from taking disciplinary
action against students involved
in underage drinking.
Liquor law arrests, citations
and violations reported to Uni-
versity and Ann Arbor Police

totaled 426 in 2012 with 941
alcohol cases handled internal-
ly, though some of these reports
may have been for the same
violation. In 2011, liquor law
arrests, citations and violations
reported to University and Ann
Arbor Police totaled 358 and 857
were handled internally.
Fires in 2012 caused more
than $500 in damage, versus
about $350 in 2011, according to
the report.

Syrian minister claims to be at
war with al Qaida-linked miliants

'Terrorist' activity
a possible cover up
for the disposal of
chemical weapons
UNITED NATIONS (AP)
- Syria's foreign minister
claimed Monday that his gov-
ernment is fighting a war
against al-Qaida-linked mili-
tants who eat human hearts
and dismember people while
they are still alive, then send
their limbs to family members.
Walid al-Moallem, address-
ing world leaders at the U.N.
General Assembly in New
York, also charged that the
U.S., Britain and France had
blocked the naming of the real
perpetrators of chemicalweap-
ons attacks in Syria, which he
blamed on the opposition.
President Barack Obama
told the same forum last week
that it was the President
Bashar Assad's regime that
was behind a chemical weap-
ons attack in August that killed
hundreds in the Damascus
suburbs and brought threats of
a retaliatory U.S. strike.
After the U.S. threatened to
attack Syria, the Assad regime
committed to getting rid of its
stockpiles of chemical weap-
ons. The U.N. Security Coun-
cil then voted unanimously
on Friday to oblige it to do so
based on a plan made by the
Organization for the Prohibi-
tion of Chemical Weapons. The
resolution broke 2-1/2 years of
paralysis on the Syria conflict
in the Security Council.
U.N. spokesman Martin
Nesirky was asked after the
speech why the U.N. was not

assigning blame for the chemi-
cal weapons attacks in Syria.
He said that U.N. guidelines
mandate that U.N. inspec-
tion teams determine whether
chemical weapons were used,
but not who used them.
Syria's main opposition
group in exile called al-Moal-
lem's speech "an attempt to
hide from the world a totali-
tarian regime's systematic and
indiscriminate attacks against
its own people." The Syrian
National Coalition (SNC) said
the minister "denied the Assad
regime's fundamental respon-
sibility for creating and per-
petuatingthis conflict."
Syria's civil war, raging for
2-1/2 years, had killed more
than 100,000 people.
"The Syrian regime has
abandoned all responsibility
to protect its people," the SNC
claimed.
Al-Moallem claimed "ter-
rorists" fighting the regime
are being supplied with
chemical weapons, but he
did not name specific nations
accused of supplying them.
The Syrian regime has long
referred to the entire opposi-
tion rising up against Assad
as "terrorists."
Al-Moallem claimed that it
was clear to all that offshoots
of al-Qaida - "the most dan-
gerous terrorist organization
in the world" - is fighting in
the civil war. But some coun-
tries refuse to recognize it, he
charged.
"The scenes of murder, man-
slaughter and eating human
hearts were shown on TV
screens, but did not touch blind
consciences," al-Moallem said
"There are innocent civil-
ians whose heads are put on
I

the grill just because they vio-
late the extremist ideology and
deviant views of al-Qaida. In
Syria ... there are murderers
who dismember human bodies
into pieces while still alive and
send their limbs to their fami-
lies, just because those citizens
are defending a unified and
secular Syria.
A video published online
in May purported to show
a member of Syria's armed
opposition eating a human
heart while the body of a Syr-
ian soldier lay close by. The
video drew condemnation
from human rights groups as
well as the Syrian National
Coalition (SNC), one of the
main opposition groups.
Another video the minis-
ter referred to purportedly
showed rebels grilling the
head of a Syrian soldier.
As rebels gain more terri-
tory and a multitude of mili-
tias, jihadists and criminals
join the fight against Assad,
reports of serious human
rights abuses committed by
armed opposition elements are
on the rise.
Summary executions com-
mitted by rebel forces - albeit
on a far smaller scale than the
regime's alleged atrocities -
have put the West in a diffi-
cult position as it seeks to arm,
train and otherwise aid the
rebels.
Al-Moallem said his gov-
ernment was committed to a
political solution to the con-
flict, which he called a war
against "terror" and not a civil
war as the international com-
munity has been referring to
it for months. He added that
"terrorists" from 83 countries
are operating in Syria

Know your debt
Students should learn about loan repayment options early on
In an effort to help borrowers who are struggling with their stu-
dent loans, the U.S. Department of Education will begin contact-
ing borrowers to inform them of their available options. Starting
this October, officials from the Department of Education will send out
e-mails to students who borrowed money for their education about pay-
ing off their debt. In line with the Obama administration's goal of low-
ering student debt, which totals over $1.1 trillion, this plan is a needed
move. Students should be encouraged to consider their options in pay-
ing off their loans - and that process should begin early.

Fuck the police

Part of the confusion surrounding loan
repayment is the vast number of programs
available through the Department of Edu-
cation. According to The New York Times,
enrollment in the department's income-linked
debt repaymentplans - plans that target those
with lower incomes following graduation - is
"modest." Programs like Income-Contingent
Repayment, Income-Based Repayment, Pub-
lic Service Loan Forgiveness and Pay as You
Earn are alien to most college students and
even graduates - partially due to lack of com-
munication to seriously consider options. "The
challenge is getting the word out," said Edu-
cation Secretary Arne Duncan. Outreach has
now become a mainstay of the Department
of Education's future plans. With this effort,
students can learn of their options sooner -
hopefully reducingincidenceofdefaulted edu-
cation loans.
Action just from the Department of Educa-
tion, however, will not suffice. The University
must also take stepsto help its students under-
stand their options in paying off their debts.

With the average Michigan graduate owing,
on average, more than $27,000, it's now time
to take a proactive role to help students from
being buried under an insurmountable debt.
Following the lead of the Education Depart-
ment, the University's Office of Financial Aid
should make a concentrated effort to inform
students of debt-repayment options - and
not just after students earn their degrees.
E-mail reminders early on, debt counseling
and lessons on how to manage debt should be
incorporated into student advising as soon as
students arrive on campus.
The Department of Education's active role
in tackling the debt of graduated students
should be commonplace. The Obama admin-
istration has prioritized higher education,
and students should be able to do so while
understanding their financial options from
the get-go. It may not be the most pleasant
thing to think about while on campus, but
knowing your options before leaving Ann
Arbor may save you from serious financial
woes in the future.

t he police are not on
your side."
As the son of an
attorney, t heard
my father say
this more times
than I can count.
He repeats it
to me over and
over, not in
an attempt to
indoctrinate
me, but because JAMES
he wanted to BRENNAN
protect me.
Throughout
his career he has seen far too many
people sent to prison, not for genuine
wrongdoing, but because the police
were simply out for blood.
Whether they're filling quotas,
following orders from the chief or
just having a bad day, police are
too often more interested in mak-
ing arrests and handing out tick-
ets than improving public safety.
Being from a wealthy, white sub-
urb, I experienced plenty of this
first hand. Police had little to
occupy themselves and developed
an intense scrutiny for underage
drinking while profiling teenagers
as dangerous troublemakers. Luck-
ily for my friends and me, getting
a citation for speeding or having a
party carried minor consequences,
if any. In urban areas with more
crime and less money for police,
however, young black men along
with other minorities often profiled
as criminals have their lives turned
upside down by the police every
day, while violent crime continues
to cripple neighborhoods.
To be clear, this isn't a personal
indictment of every single police
officer in the United States. The vast
majority of the boys and girls in blue
are hard-working people who want
to uphold the law. Bad policies - pol-
icies that direct police to ignore the
Constitution and focus on numbers
rather than on people - are mak-
ing officers look and act like villains
instead of heroes.

Do you think the University's crime
reports aren't effective? Have you ever had
your laptop, bike or cell phone stolen? Do you
wish you knew how to defend yourself in an
unsafe situation?
Campus safety isn't something most stu-
dents think about on a daily basis. Between
managing busy class schedules and balanc-
ing time for friends and studying, there isn't
always a lot of time to think about safety.
But what about your personal safety
while commuting to class or other involve-
ments? Or your walk home at night? Person-
al safety should be a priority, but it's often
overlooked.
Regardless of where you live, there are
times when you must venture off campus,
walk alone at night or feel unsafe in certain
situations. Central Student Government's
Campus Safety and Security Commission
wants to help make students not only feel safe
but also be more aware of their own safety
and security.
We have big plans this year to help stu-
dents help themselves. Last year, we hosted
free personal-safety workshops with Katy
Mattingly, chair of the Self-Defense Subcom-
mittee of the Student Safety Work Group, to
help educate students on safety. We'd like to
host these workshops again this year. CSSC
will also be hosting Bike and Laptop Regis-
tration with the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment in the Shapiro Undergraduate Library
throughout the year to help students prevent
theft. We will also be involved in launching
safety awareness campaigns, which will edu-
cate students on their rights.
We will be working closely with Beyond
the Diag to help spread awareness of these

resources to the off-campus community. We
will be contributing various safety informa-
tion tips in the monthly Beyond the Diag
newsletter to reach more off-campus stu-
dents. We will also be promoting student
use of Beyond the Diag's housing-listing ser-
vice to securely aid students in finding off-
campus housing, roommates and subletters
within the University community. This will
help eliminate scams and let students safely
browse available housing options without
scouring the neighborhoods door-to-door.
Students will be able to browse housing
options through pictures available on the
new website.
The CSSC will be working in collaboration
with the Off-Campus Transportation and
Safety Commission with the goal of imple-
menting a more extensive off-campus bus
route. Hopefully, this will reach many of the
densely populated student neighborhoods
that do not currently have night and weekend
public transportation services. This will help
alleviate dangers that students face while
walking home alone late at night in unlit,
off-campus areas or other unsafe traveling
options.
Do you have any safety concerns? Are you
interested in joining the Campus Safety and
Security Commission to make a difference on
campus? The CSSC would love to hear from
you. Please contact the commission via email
at csg.campus.safety@umich.edu. The Com-
mission meets Monday evenings from 6 p.m.
to 7 p.m. in CSG Chambers (third floor of the
Michigan Union) in Conference Room A.
Rebecca Liebschutz and Emily

ERIN PAVACIK

No scrubs, please

The first time a boy popped his
head out of a moving car's window
and asked me, "How much?" I think
I may have smiled. When you're 16
years old and walkingto the beach in
a bikini, you're eager for any boost of
self-esteem you can get - even if that
means that it's coming from a pimply
20-year-old kid who doesn't have the
guts to ask you respectfully for sex.
You're 90 pounds and still you feel as
though your thighs are too fat, your
face is too round and your stomach is
too soft. So, when you hear what you
mistakenly assume is validation, you
blush brightand giggle at the car that
has already sped away.
Today, I'm 21. I passed the
90-pound mark a few years ago and
also gained back a good amount of
confidence that my teenage years.
had stolen from me. I was taught
about self-respect and the respect
that others owe to us.
And, yet, I am still dealing with
the same catcalling that I encoun-
tered at 16. Men have gotten slightly
more creative, if not more barbaric
- my best friend will frequently
stick the entire top half of his body
out of a window and pound on
the car door, yelling "Shawtayyy"
while I watch uncomfortably from

the back seat. His actions and those
of others have forced me to face the
sad reality that remains five years
later: Catcalling is not receding; it's
only getting worse.
Ask any of your female friends,
and they will repeat my same frus-
trations. The comments range from
"Nice ass" to "How you doin', baby?"
These cat-callers always assume
you will comply. When you fail to
smile in return the man "compli-
menting" you may react with anger.
Even if you're one of those quick
enough to yell out "fuck you", the
man who has objectified you is able
to speed away without knowing or
caring that his words may have just
ruined your night, made you feel
uncomfortable or driven you inside
your home by sunset. Either way:
You lose. You have been degraded,
and the man who committed that
act is already gone. And he got to
look at your ass.
Sadly, the only way to fix this is
to revolutionize the way that these
men see all women. I'm hoping
that this might reach some of the
men around campus who're hang-
ing out of their car windows -
including my best friend. Ifa man
respected each woman he passed

on the street, catcalling would
cease to exist.
The women on this campus need
to realize that the comments hurled
out of car windows and on the street
are not compliments and shouldn't
be taken as such. These comments
are part of a bigger frame of forced
submissiveness, but they're also
indicative of a lack of the respect
that every woman on this campus
and beyond deserves.
If this doesn't change, I worry
that our future daughters will
endure the same shame that we've
endured on the sidewalks of small
towns and big cities alike. I fear
that our mothers have already seen
this, and they feel for us, knowing
the helplessness of what some call 4
"victimless fun" by rowdy teenage
boys. I hate that my sister, a fresh
20-year-old on whom I could write
an entire book about self-esteem,
takes it as a compliment when a
man says "Mmm, I like that" as he
walks past her. I want change, but 4
I don't see it coming soon. Instead,
I'll keep walking, middle finger
ready for a new assault, and head
home - where I know I'm safe.

that still satisfies after multiple

It's not a somber collection,
either. There's no shortage
of snarky quips and colorful
sarcasm, which readers have
come to expect out of the
86-year-old. "In all my years as
a pedestrian / serving juice to
guests, it never occurred to me
/ thoughtfully to imagine how
a radish feels," Ashbery writes
in "This Economy." Lines like
these pepper nicely across
Ashbery's collection.
And while that's all well
and nice, they have little
functionality or poetical
weight. They aestheticize only,
like a hobo hanging frilly drapes
in a ramshackle house.
Poetry is supposed to be
problematic. It is supposed to
invite discussion. But most of
these poems silence the room
with answers to questions that
nobody asked.
Or maybe they don't. His
poetry defies criticism, as I
mentioned before, so it's really
up to the reader, and everything
else is made tediously moot.
"Now that wasn't so easy, was
it?" Ashbery asks at the end of
"More Reluctant." You've got
that right, buddy. And I'm more
reluctant than ever.

Hope there isn't any Stevia in that tea.

Is solid secondary enough?

Wolverines need
revamped run game

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
Throughout his Monday press
conference, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke answered questions
about the struggling or inconsis-
tent groups on his football team.
He fielded questions about the
' Wolverines' offensive and defen-
sive lines, the running backs and
quarterback Devin Gardner.
He also answered questions
about the secondary, which is
different than those other units.
The group isn't exactly strug-
gling, but it isn't exactly blowing
anyone away, either.
It's not like the offensive line,
which has clear issues on the
interior, or the defensive line,
which has been inconsistent in
its pass rush.
It's solid. But what do you do
about solid? Can you do anything
about solid?
"I think we need to get a little
better from a run-support stand-
point first," Hoke said. "And
then we've got to get a little bet-
ter when you look at some of the
coverage aspects, the concepts a
little bit at times. I think there
was some real ground we could
gain, and I think we did. Last
week was great for us, and then
some of the fundamental stuff."
Through four games, Michi-
gan has defended an astounding
162 passes, more than all but 12
Division I teams. That number
gets more interesting when con-
sidering the quality of the oppo-
nents the Wolverines have faced.
Notre Dame attempted 53 pass-
es. Akron, 49. UConn, 32.
And while Michigan has
done a fine job against those 162
attempts - allowing just over
50 percent of those passes to be
completed - teams wouldn't be
attacking the secondary unless
they saw gaps on film.
The young unit has been a
revolving door of personnel.

At this point in the Michigan
football season, it's no secret that
the Wolverines have struggled on
offense, in large part due to all the
turnovers from redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner.
Michigan N
coach Brady NOTEBOOK
Hoke has
preached Gardner's faults are
as much his own as the team's.
And in that same spirit, he now
believes the best way to reduce
Gardner's turnovers may be as
simple as establishing a dominant
ground game.
"Us running the football, that's
part of it," Hoke said. "Taking
some of the pressure off of him to
do everything."
Fifth-year senior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint has car-
ried the bulk of the load for the
Wolverines, rushing for an aver-
age of almost 80 yards per game.
Gardner may be the backbone of
the offense, but when he has diffi-
culty, the Wolverines have to look
to the rest of the backs for produc-
tion. Part of the reason the Wol-
verines struggled during the first
half of the Akron and Connecticut
games was because the offensive
line couldn't open enough holes
for Toussaint.
Hoke has talked all season
about getting some of the other
running backs - freshmen Der-
rick Green and De'Veon Smith
and junior Thomas Rawls - more
reps during games, but so far, that
trio has played sparingly. Green
has gained the most rushing
yards of the other tailbacks, but
that's still just 60 yards total -
58 of them came against Central
Michigan.
Hoke has minimized the num-
ber of Toussaint's reps in practice

recently and wants it to translate
into a more well-rounded ground
game.
"We would love to (lessen
Toussaint's load)," Hoke said. "I
think it gives him where he can be
fresh, and I think it gives another
guy an opportunity, who's a little
different than what Fitz is."
CHANGE AT CENTER: With
the bye sandwiched between the
Connecticutgame and Michigan's
Big Ten opener against Minne-
sota, there was some speculation
that Hoke would use that time to
change up the interior line that
has struggled lately.
But as of Monday, there was
still no change in the lineup -
Hoke said the coaching staff
won't have a decision of what it
wants to do with the group until
after Tuesday's practice.
"We wouldn't have a problem
making a change if that's what we
deem we want to do," Hoke said.
"I think we're at the point where
we want to make sure (of our deci-
sion), so one more day isn't going
to hurt us."
The biggest change would
come at center. Hoke is flirting
with the idea of moving redshirt
sophomore left guard Graham
Glasgow over to replace redshirt
sophomore Jack Miller at center.
Then, either redshirt sophomore
Chris Bryant or redshirt junior
Joey Burzynski would fill in for
Glasgow at guard.
A RESTFUL BYE: After Con-
necticut, Hoke said Gardner was a
little banged up. When Michigan
returned to practice last week,
though, it was nothing to be con-
cerned about.
"We went out (last) Tuesday,
and (Gardner) didn't look sore,"
Hoke said. "He may be doing a
good job acting because he knows
there are lot of guys who are sore
out there. It's just part of it."

'Michigan's 12th man on the field

By JUSTIN STERN
For theDaily
For Michigan freshman defen-
seman Lars Eckenrode, moti-
vation to take the pitch doesn't
come from a game-winning shot
or a goal-saving tackle. It doesn't
come from one day drawing cor-
porate sponsors on clothing or
the prospects of a professional
career.
For Eckenrode, the fire with-
in isn't stirred by something so
materialistic. For him, takingthe
field is about honoring a fallen
friend. It's about remembering
one moment in high school that
not only motivated him as he
continued his soccer career, but
also made him into the man he is
today.
In March 2012, Eckenrode's
classmates at West Springfield
(Va.) High School were struck
with tragedy.
Football player Jordan Trun-
fio was diagnosed with a brain
tumor that would later take his
life.
"I first found out when (the
quarterback of the football team)
had just told me, 'Jordan was
diagnosed with brain cancer
and they don't know how long he
has,' " Eckenrode said. "My ini-
tial reaction was being horrified,
because how often do you hear of
an 18-year-old being diagnosed
with cancer? Especially for it to
be someone that I know and who
went to the same school as me,
it's hard."
Whether it was the quick
glances in the weight room or
making each other laugh dur-
ing class in a school of 2,285
students, the two became very
 familiar with one another and
formed a unique friendship.
"Jordan wasn't one of my
closest friends, but everyone
at school knew him because he
was a fantastic football player,"
Eckenrode said. "I put myself in
1 his position and thought, 'What
would I want from the people
around me if I was in this situa-
tion?'"
Once treatment started, Eck-
enrode was unaware of the hos-


around each other and sang
Jordan's favorite song - Don
McLean's American Pie. Before
long, the audience joined in and
the entire gym served as final
tribute to Jordan.
Students, parents, and com-
munity members shed tears,
unable to hold back their emo-
tions.
"It was possibly the single-
most saddest moment of my life,"
Eckenrode said.
Eckenrode also planned a
charity carwash with the help
of the football staff, which also
raised around $12,000.
Even though Jordan lived lon-
ger than doctors anticipated, the
tumor took his life on June 6th,
two months before Eckenrode
began his journey in Ann Arbor.
"He showed me that attitude
and being strong really matters,"
Eckenrode said. "Never make
excuses. Sometimes people think
they are having tough times, but
in reality, it is nothing compared
to what he went through."
Jordan Trunfio passed away
holding a pendant with the Bible
verse of John 3:16 written on it.
In honor of Jordan's memory,
Eckenrode and his fellow high-
school friends wear the verse on
a necklace every day.
As Eckenrode heads to the
locker room to change into his
uniform before every match,
he is required to take off this
jewelry, per NCAA regulations.
However, Eckenrode wears a
wristband with No. 58 (Jordan's
football number) and a grey rib-
bon printed to support the Amer-
ican Brain Tumor Association.
And now, whenever Ecken-
rode runs onto the field, Jordan
runs with him.
"Jordan's story made me real-
ize that life can go before you in
the blink of an eye," Eckenrode
said. "You never know what you
are going to lose and how you are
going to lose them. We all need
to cherish the people we have in
our life and be grateful for them
because you never know when
they are going to go."
That's all the motivation Eck-
enrode needs.
