UMich President dismissed at closed-door Regents meeting due to “inappropriate relationship” with subordinate

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

has 
been 
fired 
effective 

immediately 
following 
an 

internal investigation revealing 
Schlissel’s 
inappropriate 

behavior with a subordinate at 
the University, according to a 
Saturday press release from the 
Board of Regents. 

The decision was made at 

a closed-door Board meeting 
Saturday morning without a 
public vote after the board 
hired a third party investigator 
to determine whether or not 
Schlissel’s actions as president 
had violated the University’s 
supervisor relationship policy.

“It is with great disappointment 

that we announce that the 
University of Michigan Board of 
Regents has removed Dr. Mark 
Schlissel as President of the 
University of Michigan, effective 
immediately,” the Regents wrote 
in a Saturday press release.

The 
policy, 
which 
was 

introduced 
in 
July 
2021, 

states that “a Supervisor may 
not, 
implicitly 
or 
explicitly, 

initiate or attempt to initiate 
an Intimate Relationship with 
a Supervisee over whom they 
exercise supervisory authority,” 
and was implemented in July 
2021 
following 
allegations 

former Provost Martin Philbert 
had used his position to coerce 
women into sexual relationships. 

The firing comes after an 

anonymous complaint submitted 
on Dec. 8. revealed Schlissel 
had been in an inappropriate 

relationship with a University 
employee. 
A 
subsequent 

investigation 
was 
performed 

which found he had used his 
University 
email 
account 
to 

inappropriately 
communicate 

with said employee. 

Schlissel’s existing contract 

contained a morals clause which 
stated his behavior as President 
“be consistent with promoting 
the 
dignity, 
reputation, 
and 

academic 
excellence 
of 
the 

University.” 

The regents also released a 

letter transmitted to Schlissel 
informing him of his termination 
Saturday after the vote. In 
it, the regents outlined their 
justification 
for 
firing 
him, 

citing 
messages 
sent 
from 

his 
University 
email 
to 
a 

subordinate. Because the regents 
fired Schlissel for cause, he will 
no longer receive the golden 
parachute he and the regents 
negotiated when he announced 
he would resign in 2023.

Schlissel 
had 
previously 

provoked the regents’ ire for 
failing 
to 
to 
communicate 

with the board regarding the 
Detroit Center for Innovation. 
Talks 
broke 
down 
between 

donor Stephen M. Ross and Dan 
Gilbert, who owned the site. 
An anonymous administration 
official who spoke to the Detroit 
Free Press said the regents felt 
Schlissel left them in the dark as 
negotiations faltered.

In 
October, 
Schlissel 

announced that he would be 
stepping down from the job in 
June 2023, a year earlier than 
planned. The Detroit Free Press at 
the time categorized his stepping 
down early as a deal between the 

members of the board who were 
satisfied and dissatisfied with 
his performance. 

The decision was announced 

Saturday night. A press release 
from the University announced 
president 
emerita 
Mary 
Sue 

Coleman will serve as interim 
president. Coleman served as 
president from 2002 until 2014. 

In a statement posted to 

the Board of Regents website, 
Coleman wrote she was sad to 
learn of the allegations against 
Schlissel but was honored to once 
again be leading the University.

“While 
saddened 
by 
the 

circumstances, I am honored 
to be asked to again serve 
the University of Michigan,” 
Coleman wrote. “When I left the 
U-M campus at the end of my 
presidency in 2014, I said serving 
this great university was the 
most rewarding experience of 
my professional life. I’m happy 
to serve again in this important 
interim role.” 

The 
University 
hired 
the 

private law firm Jenner & Block 
to continue the investigation into 
Schlissel’s behavior. According to 
the Detroit Free Press, the firm 
is also investigating whether 
Schlissel 
misused 
University 

funds to support his relationship 
with the unnamed subordinate.

In an email obtained by the 

Michigan Daily addressed to 
LSA employees Saturday night, 
LSA Dean Anne Curzan wrote 
she would be meeting with 
fellow deans and senior leaders 
tomorrow and will communicate 
additional updates in the coming 
days.

Curzan 
wrote 
Schlissel’s 

firing reinforced to need for 

sexual misconduct prevention on 
campus.

“As I process this news, it only 

strengthens 
my 
commitment 

to continuing the work we 
have been undertaking in the 
college, with the wise, research-
informed 
guidance 
of 
the 

Preventing Sexual Harassment 
Working Group,” Curzan wrote. 
“It is essential.”

Jonathan 
Vaughn, 
former 

University football and notable 

survivor of the late Doctor Robert 
Anderson who has been camped 
outside of Schlissel’s house for 
nearly 100 days in protest of the 
University’s handling of sexual 
misconduct tweeted Schlissel’s 
firing would help create a safer 
campus. 

“This news is fuel for my 

mission: the safety & protection 
of the students of this university,” 
Vaughn wrote. “After 99 days of 
being ignored in front of former 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

home, the regents finally made 
1 good choice. But there must be 
many more if U-M is to be fully 
accountable.”

 ‘It’s a long time coming:’ 
U-M students rally in front 
of presidential residence

 Over 100 community members gather outside 

South University home following 

‘U’ leader’s termination

ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

LSA 
freshman 
Jack 

Thompson 
was 
one 

of the first students to 
arrive outside of former 
University President Mark 
Schlissel’s residence after 
news broke that he had 
been fired by the Board 
of Regents on Saturday. 
With 
a 
saxophone 
in 

hand, he satirically played 
George Michael’s “Careless 
Whisper” and the classic 
Big House anthem “Mr. 
Brightside” by The Killers 
as 
fellow 
protesters 

gradually gathered and 
cheered around him.

“I live in East Quad, 

and my friends and I were 
sitting in a lounge and I 
said, ‘Wouldn’t it be funny if 
we stopped by and brought 
an instrument?’ And we’ve 
kind of amassed a bit of a 
group here,” Thompson 
said. 

Over 
100 
students 

gathered 
outside 
the 

President’s 
House 
on 

Saturday evening following 
the report of Schlissel’s 
termination by the Board 
of Regents earlier this 
afternoon. 
Schlissel 

was fired for engaging 

in 
an 
“inappropriate 

relationship” 
with 

a 
subordinate 
at 
the 

University as early as 
Sept. 2019. In Dec. 2021, 
an anonymous complaint 
was filed which led to an 
internal investigation into 
Schlissel’s behavior. 

The 
investigation 

revealed 
inappropriate 

emails sent from Schlissel’s 
U-M email account to the 
subordinate, referred to 
as Individual 1. Schlissel’s 
emails contained an article 
related to sexual fantasies, 
details of travelling to 
California and Paris with 
Individual 1 as well as other 
inappropriate 
comments 

related to their relationship. 
 
 

“It’s 
recently 
been 

revealed that (Schlissel) 
had an affair with a staff 
member, and that’s not 
really a good thing when 
you’re the president of one 
of the biggest schools in the 
country,” Thompson said. 
“Kind of makes a mockery 
of our name. So I’d like to 
return the favor a little bit.”

As Thompson continued 

to play into the night, more 
students joined in and 
began chanting “Show your 
face!” and “Mark, are you 
home?” at the only window 
with its blinds half open 
on his house. Cars driving 
by frequently honked as 
students cheered in return 

as Mr. Brightside and Pump 
it Up filled the background. 
One protester held a “Can 
I have a private briefing?” 
sign in reference to one of 
the emails Schlissel sent to 
the subordinate. 

“I love performing and 

it’s a really good chance 
to kind of get a crowd out 
here,” Thompson said. “I 
feel terrible for his family. 
I can’t believe that he 
actually 
did 
something 

in such a high position 
of power. I mean, that’s 
simply an abuse of power. 
And 
that’s 
something 

that I don’t think any of 
the students in Michigan 
would stand for.”

The last time the Board 

of Regents dismissed a 
president was in 1863, 
when former University 
President Henry Philip 
Tappan was dismissed due 
to “difficulties with the 
regents on matters both 
of policy and personality,” 
according to the Bentley 
Historical Library.

LSA 
sophomore 

Neil Peterson came to 
Schlissel’s 
house 
with 

fellow Residential College 
students 
who 
brought 

instruments. 
Peterson 

brought his trumpet to 
have a “celebration.”

Emails, texts released between 

University head, anonymous employee 

in internal investigation

118-page document details improper messages dating back to September 2019

Emails 
from 
former 

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

were released in a 118-page 
document Saturday evening, 
detailing 
inappropriate 

communication 
with 
a 

subordinate at the University. 
The emails were revealed 
as 
part 
of 
an 
internal 

investigation into Schlissel’s 
behavior, ultimately leading 
to his firing.

The investigation revealed 

a series of communication 
between Schlissel and an 
unnamed 
subordinate, 

identified 
in 
the 
emails 

as 
“Individual 
1,” 
which 

disclosed 
multiple 
emails 

between 
the 
two 
dating 

back to Sept. 2019 in which 
Schlissel sent the employee 
an article by the New Yorker 
entitled “Sexual Fantasies of 
Everyday New Yorkers.” In 
that email, Schlissel told the 
employee the article was “just 
for fun.” 

The 
emails 
also 
detail 

several trips Schlissel and the 
employee went on together, 
including one to California 
and 
another 
to 
Europe. 

The 
emails 
also 
include 

receipts for dinner and movie 
reservations. 

The regents also released a 

letter sent to Schissel outlining 
the causes for his termination 

of 
employment, 
including 

exchanging 
inappropriate 

emails with Individual 1 using 
his official U-M account.

In one exchange on July 

1, 2021, Individual 1 wrote 
to Schlissel saying that her 
“heart 
hurts,” 
to 
which 

Schlissel responded with “i 
know. mine too.” Schlissel 
also wrote to the individual 
that “this is my fault,” that 
he is “in pain too” and that he 
still wishes he “were strong 
enough to find a way.”

Schlissel also responded 

to Individual 1’s official U-M 
email address on Jan. 9, 2021 
with “Love it when you say 
that.” Schlissel made a similar 
remark on April 25, 2020, 
according to the regents’ 
letter.

The regents cite another 

instance on Nov. 4, 2021, 
in 
which 
Schlissel 
was 

scheduled to attend a U-M 
basketball game as part of his 
official duties as president. 
On that day, Schlissel wrote 
to Individual 1 saying that 
“the only reason I agreed to 
go was to go with you. there 
is a conspiracy against me.” 
According to the regents, 
Schlissel was not able to sit 
next to Individual 1, prompting 
his “disappointment.” 

On Dec. 3, 2021, Schlissel 

also wrote Individual 1 about 
the Big Ten Championship 
“President’s 
Suite 
briefing 

Info,” to which he said “You 
can give me a private briefing.”

The 
emails 
also 
detail 

various gifts Schlissel sent 
to Individual 1, including a 
matching set of gifts and U-M 
facemasks for both of them.

The emails also reveal 

Schlissel and Individual 1 
took several trips together, 
including one to India. The 
trip connected through Paris, 
prompting 
an 
exchange 

between Individual 1 and 
Schlissel about a hypothetical 
situation 
in 
the 
city 
if 

their flight were canceled, 
writing “What if we miss our 
connection and get stuck in 
Paris…” It is unclear if this trip 
was for University business or 
personal reasons.

Schlissel and the employee 

also exchanged texts over 
iMessage, which were also 
included in the document. 

“I am looking forward to 

seeing you later. That thought 
will get me through (sic) day,” 
Schlissel texted Individual 1 
on June 30, 2021. 

The emails come after 

the University updated it’s 
sexual misconduct policy in 
Sept. 2021, which included 
more concrete definitions of 
misconduct, clarifications on 
ways to report misconduct 
and outlines for procedures in 
addressing sexual and gender-
based misconduct allegations. 

Schlissel’s term was filled 

with 
instances 
of 
sexual 

misconduct 
investigations 

among 
University 
faculty 

and staff, including former 
Provost Martin Philbert, who 
was the second-in-command 

below Schlissel. 

In 
Nov. 
2020, 
the 

University 
reached 
a 

settlement with eight women 
who were sexually assaulted 
by Philbert, who had a history 
of sexually harassing female 
employees and having sexual 
relationships 
in 
university 

offices. 
The 
settlement 

came after an investigation 
conducted by WilmerHale, 
which 
found 
“significant 

evidence” 
that 
Philbert 

violated 
the 
University’s 

sexual misconduct policy. 

In addition to the Philbert 

case, more than 950 survivors 
have come forward alleging 
thousands of instances of 
sexual misconduct in what 
may be the most instances 
of misconduct by a single 
person 
in 
U.S. 
history. 

Anderson 
survivor 
and 

former U-M football player 
Jonathan Vaughn is running 
for the Board of Regents, 
with his campaign speaking 
against Schlissel’s response 
to victims. He has been 
camping outside of President 
Schlissel’s house since Oct. 8, 
protesting the president’s lack 
of response to his and other 
survivors’ demands.

CAMPUS LIFE

At the foot of the Harlan 

Hatcher Graduate Library, two 
microphones were set up. A group 
of students congregated around 
a small table, serving themselves 
hot chocolate, while clusters of 
families and students began to 
arrive. 

For the past 16 years, the 

Michigan Community Scholars 
Program has honored the legacy 
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on 
the namesake holiday with their 
Circle of Unity celebration. The 
event returned in person this 
year, following last year’s virtual 
installment. 

The program began with a 

performance 
from 
Michigan 

natives Joe Reilly and Julie 
Beutel, who sang a series of 
songs, including Reilly’s own song 
entitled ‘The Circle.’ Attendees 
formed a large circle and were 
encouraged to participate in a 
sing-along to tunes inspiring 
action and uplifting marginalized 
groups. 

William Alt, MCSP Community 

Engagement Coordinator said the 
event was very much student-led. 

Many of the performances 

featured students, including a 
rendition of Taylor Swift and 
Ed Sheeran’s “Everything Has 
Changed,” which was performed 
by Blue Records, a recording 

group at the University of 

Michigan. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Sarah 

Oguntomilade 
followed 
this 

performance with a reading of her 
poem,

“Enemies to Lovers,” which 

explores the dual-edged nature of 

history and how the reprehensible 
actions of the past inform the 
present day. 

“Terribly horrible events have 

created terribly beautiful realities, 
and because of that, nothing is 
black and white, everything is 
in the grey,” Oguntomilade said. 
“Through this lense, I share the 
story of my life and how I’ve 
gotten to this point, all while 
using the metaphor of enemies to 
lovers, my favorite literary genre.” 

Oguntomilade 
also 
read 

another original poem called “My 
Name Is,” which Oguntomilade 
said highlights her own life 
journey with faith and how 
faith connects with Dr. King’s 
advocacy.

“‘My Name Is’ also describes 

my life and my story, however this 
time through the lense of faith,” 

Ogutomilade said. “I recognize 
that the faith that brought great 
pain in the past is the same faith 
that drove Reverend Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. in his activism 
and his peace movements.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Leilani 

Fonseca then spoke briefly about 
the impact she has been able to 
create as a peer mentor through 
MCSP. 

“It is through communities like 

(MCSP) that I feel like my dreams 
will soon be a reality,” Fonseca 
said. “The idea that I will one day 
be able to give back and support 
my community in the way they 
have supported (me) will always 
bring warmth to my heart.” 

As the event came to a close, 

Reilly and Beutel performed more 
songs. Papers with QR codes were 
handed out, directing attendees to 

information about the Freedom 
to Vote Act and providing phone 
numbers to the Senate and the 
House of Representatives, as well 
as a template for those interested 
in writing letters to members of 
Congress about the Freedom to 
Vote Act. 

Alt also said the focus of the 

event was to acknowledge Dr. 
King’s life as well as a way for the 
community to come together.

“We always try to stress here in 

MCSP that you have a place here,” 
Alt said. “Dr. King’s message of 
the Beloved Community, this 
idea that everybody has a right to 
participate, that everybody has a 
right and a place to belong in this 
community.”

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan Martin Luther 

King Jr. Symposium memorial keynote lecture 
Monday featured speakers Maria de Lourdes 
Hinojosa Ojeda and Dr. Rashad Richey. The 
virtual keynote was one of many events held as 
a part of the 2022 Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr. Symposium titled “This Is America.”

Organized by the Office of Academic 

Multicultural Initiatives, the Symposium has 
been an annual event since 1986. This year, the 
events were originally scheduled to take place 
in person at Hill Auditorium, but were moved 

to a virtual format due to rising COVID-19 
cases.

Keynote speaker Richey –– a professor, 

political 
analyst 
and 
Emmy-nominated 

broadcaster –– discussed the transformation 
and palatability of Rev. Dr. King’s ideas, as well 
as how he was perceived by the public.

“We have cherry picked what we would like 

Dr. King to be,” Richey said. “Dr. King was 
called radical. They called him a communist. 
They said he was a socialist. The same people 
who called him that were simply adversarial to 
a policy change in America.”

Richey also emphasized the importance of 

understanding the difference between equality 
and equity.

“This issue of equality versus equity has been 

front and center in many conversations in this 
country. I think some people have intentionally 
mischaracterized the two,” Richey said. “Dr. 
King talked about something called genuine 
equality as opposed to equality as it relates to 
mobility, to the Civil Rights Bill that allows you 
to go places. He said ‘we need genuine equality.’ 
That was his way of saying equity.”

Hinojosa, multimedia journalist and author, 

spoke regarding the significance of both 
owning and sharing one’s history and story 
while connecting her messages to the life and 
lessons of Dr. King.

Steve Pemberton – author, 

business leader and motivational 
speaker – spoke to over 200 
members of the University of 
Michigan community Monday 
over Zoom for the University’s 
“This is America” Martin Luther 
King Jr. symposium. Pemberton 
centered the discussion on Rev. 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and

Dr. King symposium features professor 

Lakesha Butler on health inequities

Event highlights disparities in healthcare, 

higher education in America

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 

College of Pharmacy and MLK 
Health 
Sciences 
Committee 

organized a lecture entitled “This 
is America: Confronting Health 
Inequities … Writing Prescriptions 
for Change” to honor Rev. Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day. This was the first 
of a complete symposium featuring 
future events on Medical Apartheid 
and Racial Disparities in Pain 
Management.

The lecture was delivered by 

Lakesha Butler, a clinical professor 
of pharmacy practice and the 
director of diversity, equity and 
inclusion at the Southern Illinois 
University 
Edwardsville 
(SIUE) 

School of Pharmacy. She discussed 
the importance of disrupting and 
dismantling inequities and injustices 
in healthcare and higher education. 
As a national speaker on the topics 
of 
antiracism, 
diversity, 
equity 

and inclusion, Butler began her 
presentation discussing the different 
versions of America that exist in 
society.

“There are two Americas. One is 

beautiful where millions have food 
and material, culture and education 
for their minds. They have freedom 
and human dignity,” Butler said. “But 
there is another America that has a 
daily ugliness. Millions are forced to 
live in distressed housing conditions. 
Unemployment is a reality in this 
lonely island of poverty. This causes 
bitterness, anguish and angst.”

Event host Cherie Dotson, student 

affairs program manager for Student 
Recruitment & Outreach at the 
U-M College of Pharmacy, opened 
the lecture with remarks and a 
performance by Committed of the 
song “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”

In August 2021, “the Yak 

was back.” Popular anonymous 
social media platform Yik Yak 
reappeared in the Apple App 
Store after being shut down 
in 2017 due to concerns about 
cyberbullying and a rapidly 
declining user base. When Yik 
Yak returned, college students 
across the country flocked back 
to the application, and students 
at the University of Michigan 
were no exception.

Compared to other popular 

social media applications such 

as Instagram or TikTok, Yik Yak 
is unique in the way it empha-
sizes a connection with local 
communities, only displaying 
posts within a five-mile radius 
of the user. Yik Yak’s biggest 
distinction, however, is that its 
users remain anonymous. Users 
can “upvote” or “downvote” 
anonymous “yaks,” with the 
most popular content appearing 
on the “Hot” page. Addition-
ally, in the updated app, posts 
with five or more downvotes 
are removed from the platform 
altogether. 

While yaks typically concern 

a multitude of topics, content 
posted within the vicinity of the 

University has focused on the 
ongoing sorority recruitment 
process since Jan. 5, the day of 
potential new member (PNM) 
orientation. Some of the most 
popular yaks during the week 
of Jan. 9 include “this sorority 
process is very humbling,” and 
“sororities have hired the FBI to 
downvote and delete any posts 
criticizing them.” 

Among the numerous sorority 

recruitment yaks is one recur-
ring name — The PNM Princess. 
Described by many students 
as the “Gossip Girl” or “Radio 
Rebel” of sorority recruitment, 
The PNM Princess has a Reddit 
account she has been using to 

post somewhat confrontational 
statements about the Michi-
gan sorority recruitment pro-
cess and her individual desire 
— or lack thereof — to join each 
house. 

The 
Princess’s 
blog-style 

Reddit posts, entitled “The 
PNM Diaries,” have quickly 
dominated the “Hot” page on 
Yik Yak, prompting anonymous 
responses such as, “Pnm prin-
cess better be typing fast I’m so 
excited for the (tea),” and “PNM 
PRINCESS I NEED U TO POST 
BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP.” 

In a Jan. 13 Reddit post rank-

ing the sorority houses at the 
University, the Princess took 

a shot at “popular” sororities, 
claiming she was not sharing 
her personal opinions of the 
houses but rather ranking them 
according to the “values” they 
displayed in each round of rush 
thus far.

“I’d like to preface this with 

a simple warning — this isn’t 
about *true* rankings,” the 
Princess 
wrote. 
“Obviously 

despite their racism, homopho-
bia, fatphobia, and other general 
shittiness, the “top” sororities 
will remain at the “top.” Funny 
how the most hated people on 
campus still maintain their 
“popularity.” But hey, we’ve all 
seen Mean Girls; we know how 
this works.”

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, the PNM Prin-
cess revealed she is a freshman, 
but does not want her name pub-
lished at this time. She told The 
Daily her original goal for “The 
PNM Diaries” was to have a way 
to organize her honest thoughts 
about the rush process.

“Well, to be honest, it kind of 

was a way for me to write down 
my thoughts and opinions of 
each house (and) at first it just 
sort of helped me sort out my 
own thoughts,” the Princess 
said. “And then I (realized) I 
hear way too much about what 
the sororities are thinking, but 
you never hear the other side 
of the story,” the Princess said. 
“We never hear what it’s like to 
be a PNM.”

The Princess said PNMs 

often feel as though they lack 
a voice during sorority recruit-
ment because they are under 
constant pressure to “perform” 
well for each sorority. The Prin-
cess said if she were not anony-
mous, she would have been 
dropped from every sorority for 
publicly sharing her unadulter-
ated thoughts about the differ-
ent organizations.

“So, really PNMs cannot be 

honest on a public platform… 
because every house would 
instantly drop you,” the Prin-
cess said. “I don’t think that 
I would have been capable of 
telling my story if it weren’t for 
being anonymous.

When asked if she ever plans 

to reveal her identity, the PNM 
Princess was doubtful, saying 
sharing that information would 
isolate her from whichever 

sorority she ends up joining. 

“This is actually a secret that 

I don’t really intend on ever tell-
ing anybody,” the Princess said. 
“There are a select few people 
who I seriously trust to know 
my true identity and honestly, 
regardless of how close I will 
become with my future (soror-
ity) sisters, I doubt I will ever 
tell anybody else because it’s 
not worth becoming a social 
pariah.”

However, many members of 

“the herd,” as YikYak’s deni-
zens are known, have criticized 
the Princess’s posts, including 
“can’t wait for one of the (com-
puter science) majors to leak 
pnm princess’s IP address,” 
and “can’t wait to hear the pnm 
princess after she gets dropped 
from all the top houses.”

LSA sophomore Alexander 

Manthous said the focus on 
sorority recruitment on Yik Yak 
is unrelatable and tiresome. 

“I’ve definitely seen a ton 

of sorority yik yaks, and hon-
estly those … bore me to death,” 
Manthous said. “I can’t relate 
to them. (The posts) talk about 
specific things and specific 
sororities and I just feel like I 
don’t understand what they’re 
referring to.”

LSA senior Hayley Sanders, 

the vice president of recruit-
ment at Sigma Delta Tau, said 
she appreciated the posts from 
The PNM Princess.

“I was pleasantly surprised 

with what (The PNM Princess) 
said about philanthropy and our 
DEI speech,” Sanders said. “We 
worked so hard to make sure 
we were saying exactly what 
we wanted to say. And we’ve 
been getting amazing feedback 
regardless of what the Princess 
says. So I don’t have any com-
plaints at all.”

Still, 
Sanders 
cautioned 

PNMs to avoid pursuing sorori-
ties based on reputation or 
social rank according to online 
forums.

“As hard as it is to separate 

yourself from (what the Prin-
cess writes), you will be so much 
happier when you like being (a 
member) of a sorority,” Sanders 
said.

Proposed legislation will allow Anderson survivors to sue the 

University

Bills to provide a 30-day window to file lawsuit outside of the statute of limitations, remove use the defense of government immunity

Trigger warning: Mentions of sexual assault
On Jan. 4, State Senator Tom Barrett (R-Char-

lotte) announced plans to introduce legislation that 
would aid victims of former University of Michigan 
athletic doctor Robert Anderson in pursuing legal 
action against the University.

These bills would provide Anderson survivors 

with a 30-day window to sue the University for its 
role in the abuse outside of the statute of limitations. 
The legislation would also remove the University’s 
ability to use the defense of government immunity.

In a Jan. 4 press release, Barrett emphasized 

Michigan lawmakers’ responsibility to take action 
against sexual abuse.

“As lawmakers, we have a moral duty to update 

our laws to protect survivors and provide them with 
legal recourse against institutions that enable abus-
ers, even when those institutions are agents of the 
government,” Barrett said. “The university has not 
denied these tragic events happened, therefore, we 
are obliged to provide a path forward to justice for 
the victims.”

White Law PLLC, a law firm located in Okemos, 

Michigan, represented over 160 victims of former 
Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics 
doctor Larry Nassar and currently represents doz-
ens of Anderson survivors. Alexander Rusek, a 
senior associate attorney with White Law PLLC, 
said in an interview with The Daily that Barrett’s 
proposed legislation would provide an opportunity 
for survivors to pursue legal action decades later.

“(These bills) will give survivors of Dr. Ander-

son the opportunity to bring their case in the court 
because many times in Michigan, our statute of 
limitations limits survivors from bringing lawsuits 
only because of how long ago the abuse happened,” 
Rusek said. “The science and research shows us that 
survivors, in general, of childhood sexual abuse 
don’t come forward — if they ever do — until approx-
imately age 48 to 52 … (T)hese bills (would) allow 
survivors to have access to justice going forward … 
(and) remove the statute of limitations.”

Nassar survivor Grace French founded The Army 

of Survivors, an organization dedicated to raising 
awareness about the systemic sexual abuse of ath-
letes and protecting victims by creating a system 
that holds perpetrators accountable. The Army of 
Survivors works to create and allocate supportive 
resources for survivors of sexual violence, accord-
ing to their website. French said Barrett’s legislation 
would be a great step forward in helping survivors 
find justice.

“I think the legislation is a win for survivors and 

it’s really giving access for these survivors to come 
forward and … get the justice that they deserve,” 
French said. “This is definitely not the end of what 
we hope to do in the future for survivors in Michi-
gan, because there’s so many more people that we 
want to make sure that have access to justice, but it’s 
a really good step in that direction.”

Julia Schettenhelm, LSA junior and Communica-

tions Director for the University of Michigan’s chap-
ter of College Democrats, wrote in an email to The 
Daily that College Democrats approve of the legisla-
tor’s efforts to support survivors. 

“We stand with the Anderson survivors and con-

tinue to support the Hail to the Victims movement,” 
Schettenhelm wrote. “As such, we agree that offering 
this kind of support to survivors is the right thing to do.”

In an email to The Daily, Margaret Beste, LSA 

senior and vice chair of College Republicans at the 
University of Michigan, said they also support the 
legislation.

“Legislation that supports survivors of sexual 

abuse, assualt, and harrassment, especially in navi-
gating the emotional and material challenges of the 
judicial system, is a wholly worthwhile pursuit,” 
Beste wrote. “The presently outlined pieces of the 
proposal, including a 30-day window for survivors 
to file suit against the University and the removal 
of procedural obstacles, appear to be sensible and 
meaningful steps to help survivors obtain justice. 
We look forward to learning more about the phras-
ing and implementation of the details outlined in the 
proposal and how we might help move the legislation 
forward.”

Rusek weighed in on the importance of this leg-

islation to people with a wide range of backgrounds 
and political affiliations.

“I think that it’s important that people know 

that… – no matter what your background or politi-
cal affiliations – this is legislation that everyone can 
get behind,” Rusek said. “Bipartisan effort is really 
powerful and sends a message to the enablers and 
perpetrators of sexual abuse in the state that we’re 
not going to stand for it anymore. And (they’re) going 
to be held accountable for it.”

Initially published in 2014, 

“Bungo Stray Dogs” is an ongoing 
manga series following Nakajima 
Atsushi, a homeless orphan in 
Japan. After getting kicked out of 
yet another orphanage and on the 
brink of starvation, he acciden-
tally stops the suicide of Detec-
tive Osamu Dazai. Upon learning 
that Atsushi can transform into 
a white tiger, Dazai recruits him 
into the Armed Detective Agen-
cy (ADA), a team of people with 
similar 
supernatural 
abilities. 

Finally part of a family, Atsushi 
and the rest of the ADA use their 
abilities to fight crime around 
Yokohama and meet other shape-
shifters in the process.

That’s just a little background. 

However, this article will not be 
focusing on the story itself, nor 
the characters. What’s special 
about “Bungo Stray Dogs” is the 
characters’ names, as most, if not 
all, characters are named after 
famous authors and poets. The 
abilities of the characters usu-
ally correspond with the literary 
styles or works of the person they 
are named after. Even the man-
ga’s title, “Bungo Stray Dogs,” 
incorporates literature: The word 
“bungo” translates to “literary” 
in English. 

By referencing these vari-

ous literary figures and works, 
“Bungo Stray Dogs” exposes its 
fans, specifically those from the 
West, to works of literature and 
authors they may never have 
heard of otherwise. Many of the 
main characters are named after 
Japanese authors and poets, so 
most western audience mem-
bers may have trouble recogniz-
ing their names and influences. 
However, the series also intro-
duces characters named after 
more well-known western fig-
ures: Edgar Allan Poe, Francis 
Fitzgerald and H.P. Lovecraft, for 
example. Once fans recognized 
that the characters were named 
after authors, they were quickly 
inspired to look into their vari-
ous works. This sparked a popu-
lar trend on TikTok in which fans 
bought the works of referenced 
authors. Many of these books 

have been integrated into fandom 
conversations. Author names are 
not the only literary reference 
within “Bungo Stray Dogs,” as 
some of its characters are based 
on figures from these novels or 
even the novels’ authors them-
selves. In this way, reading the 
works of the authors can help 
shed light on both the manga and 
its characters.

Many online phenomena have 

come about due to fans of the 
series becoming more familiar 
with the authors that characters 
are named after. For example, 
some fans have created entire 
blogs — such as Japanese Litera-
ture and Bungo Stray Dog Tum-
blr Blog and BSD Die Hard Fan 
Tumblr Blog — connecting Japa-
nese literature to the show, docu-
menting old photos of authors 
and detailing notable encounters 
that authors have had with each 
other. The two blogs above are 
actually the ones I used to learn 
more about the authors refer-
enced in BSD as well as the series 
as a whole. These blogs made 
it a lot easier to find informa-
tion about the authors and their 
works because it was all central-
ized in one place.

For me, finding new books to 

read is often difficult because I 
am very picky and the process of 
looking is too strenuous. Often I 
just give up, but having access to 
blogs like these or to TikTok cre-
ators that talk about the books has 
made that process of choosing my 
next book a lot easier. The overall 
influence of social media, specifi-
cally TikTok, is what introduced 
me to this manga series and, in 
turn, to many works of classic 
literature I was newly inspired 
to read. My introduction to these 
works is mainly attributed to 
fans of the series who go out of 
their way to create content about 
it in the form of art, edits, blogs 
or even analyses. Apart from fan 
creations, the show also motivat-
ed fans to read the literary works 
of authors both new and old. 
There are even living authors, 
such as Japanese mystery writers 
Yukito Ayatsuji and Natsuhiko 
Kyogoku, who are seeing benefits 
from references in BSD.

Prior to the release of the first 

season of “Cobra Kai” in 2018, 
fans of the original “Karate Kid” 
had played around with the idea 
that Johnny Lawrence (William 
Zabka, “The Man in the Silo”), 
long known as an antagonist, 
was in fact the tragic hero of the 
film. “How I Met Your Mother” 
brought the sentiment into the 
national pop culture conversation 
when Barney Stinson (Neil Pat-
rick Harris, “A Series of Unfor-
tunate Events”) endorsed the 
stance.

When the first episode of 

“Cobra Kai” reintroduced mid-
dle-aged Johnny as a co-protag-
onist, perhaps even more focal 
to the story than Daniel LaRusso 
(Ralph Macchio, “Kevin Can 
Wait”), the intended hero of “The 
Karate Kid,” it felt natural. Since 
its inception, “Cobra Kai” has 
sought to blur the line between 
good guys and bad guys and 
instead treat each of its characters 
as authentic, flawed individuals. 
Now in its fourth season, “Cobra 
Kai” has mastered this formula, 
leading to one of the most binge-
able and entertaining seasons of 
television in recent memory. 

Season four picks up right 

where season three left off; John-
ny and Daniel have joined forces 
to create a unified dojo to rival 
Johnny’s sinister and manipula-
tive former sensei, John Kreese 
(Martin Kove, “Once Upon a 
Time in Hollywood”), and his 
Cobra Kai dojo. The stakes are 
high with a bet in place between 
Daniel and Johnny and Kreese: 
If one of Daniel’s or Johnny’s stu-
dents wins the All-Valley Karate 
Tournament, Kreese will quit 
teaching karate for good, and 
vice-versa. Throughout the sea-
son, Johnny and Daniel struggle 

to reconcile their opposite styles 
of karate, based on offense and 
defense respectively. This dif-
ference of opinion is exacerbated 
by Johnny’s abrasive nature and 
Daniel’s my-way-or-the-highway 
attitude. 

Meanwhile, 
the 
students 

— 
Miguel 
(Xolo 
Maridueña, 

“Cleopatra in Space”), Johnny’s 
star pupil and surrogate son, 
Sam (Mary Mouser, “Gates of 
Darkness”), 
Daniel’s 
student 

and daughter, Robby (Tanner 
Buchanan, 
“He’s 
All 
That”), 

Cobra Kai’s best fighter and 
Johnny’s estranged son and Tory 
(Peyton List, “Light as a Feath-
er”), a self-reliant and resentful 
girl who Kreese takes under his 
wing — struggle with their iden-
tities. While these are the series’ 
main characters, season four fea-
tures a hefty amount of notable 
supporting characters, including 
Kenny Payne (Dallas Young, “The 
Big Show Show”), a good-hearted 
eighth-grader who turns to Cobra 
Kai after dealing with incessant 
bullying and Terry Silver (Thom-

as Ian Griffith, “The Pirate’s 
Curse”), Kreese’s diabolical part-
ner in “The Karate Kid Part III.”

The writers impressively bal-

ance the arcs of each of its numer-
ous characters. With the season 
clocking in at approximately five 
hours long, there isn’t a second to 
spare in getting every character 
to their final destination by the 
end of episode ten. In every scene, 
characters push one another to 
the next step of their develop-
ment. However, none of the prom-
inent characters are there solely 
as a vehicle for another. Each one 
has their own valid aspirations, 
fears and goals. No matter how 
seemingly evil or unlikeable a 
character is, they all have genuine 
intentions that we understand. 
Even if we don’t want them to 
achieve their specific visions of 
success, we are still rooting for 
them to end up in the best place 
possible.

Therefore, 
dilemmas 
arise 

when the interests of characters 
are at direct odds with one anoth-
er, each plotline intersecting in a 

neat pretzel. The show cleverly 
uses our desire for each charac-
ter to come out on top to keep us 
engaged and pressing play on the 
next episode. As inevitable com-
plications arise, driving charac-
ters further apart, we can’t help 
but keep watching to see how 
everything resolves. 

Many fans watch “Cobra Kai” 

for the badass fighting scenes, 
80’s nostalgia or goofy humor. 
These are definitely all great 
aspects of the show. Even so, 
the heartbeat of the show is its 
nuanced approach to the char-
acters. There is no simple ending 
where the heroes overcome the 
villains. In a show without the 
concept of heroes and villains, the 
only happy ending is one in which 
every character finds peace. 
Needless to say, season four of 
“Cobra Kai” leaves us on the edge 
of our seats, waiting for that glo-
rious moment to arrive in future 
seasons.

 ‘Mouth to Mouth’ 

needs to resuscitation

Antoine Wilson’s “Mouth to 

Mouth” is a storytelling triumph. 
Published in early January, this 
novel is intentional, focused 
and expertly delivered. Wilson 
captures the reader’s attention 
from the beginning and holds it 
all the way to the end. “Mouth 
to Mouth” lies somewhere in 
between a fable and traditional 
literary fiction but pushes past 
the limits of both genres to create 
something that leaves the reader 
questioning their own morality. 

Essentially, “Mouth to Mouth” 

is a story within a story. The 
novel opens with our narrator 
in JFK Airport, waiting to board 
his flight. By chance, he hears the 
name of Jeff Cook, encountering 
an old acquaintance from UCLA 
who happens to be boarding the 
same plane. In the narrator’s own 
words, “We hadn’t been friends, 
exactly, barely acquaintances, but 
Jeff was one of those minor play-
ers from the past who claimed 
for himself an outsize role in my 
memories.” After their shared 
flight was delayed, Jeff and our 
narrator decide to get a drink 
while waiting. Through their 
conversations, Jeff steers the 
discussion towards talking about 
near-death experiences, eventu-
ally telling our narrator, “I ended 
up in close proximity to one once. 
Not long after college, in fact, a 
year or so later. I was, through 
no planning or forethought on 
my part, responsible for saving a 
man’s life.” 

This “near-death experience” 

came to Jeff while on an early 
morning beach walk to clear his 
head. Coming off the heels of an 
intense breakup, Jeff was seeking 
clarity on his expedition. While 
there, Jeff comes across a man 

floating face down in the ocean. 
Jeff quickly decides he would 
rather not be a bystander to 
another man’s death and pulls the 
stranger out of the water and uses 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to 
save his life. Once the lifeguards 
come, Jeff is quickly pushed aside 
to allow the medics to care for 
the stranger. Jeff is obviously 
shaken up from this experience, 
especially after already being in 
a fragile emotional state from the 
breakup; in the week that follows, 
Jeff finds himself borderline 
obsessed with discovering the 
identity of this man, going back 
to the site of the event and talking 
to the lifeguards who helped save 
the stranger. This event turns out 
to be the catalyst for what comes 
next in Jeff’s story.

After getting the swimmer’s 

name — Francis Arsenault — 
and address from the lifeguard, 
Jeff’s curiosity grows, leading 
him to drive to Francis’s house. 
Jeff finds that the address the 
lifeguard gave was for a house 
Francis was building. Without a 
Francis sighting as he had hoped, 
Jeff decides to look him up online 
and finds out Francis works as 
an art gallery owner. Jeff then 
begins to purposely put himself 
in positions to cross paths with 
Francis, hoping the man will 
recognize him. Without giving 
too much away, Jeff entrenches 
himself deeply into Francis’s life, 
beginning with getting a job as 
a receptionist at Francis’s gal-
lery. Jeff’s story only grows more 
warped and complex, eventually 
leading to an unexpected final 
twist. Wilson’s masterful plot 
development is one of the main 
reasons “Mouth to Mouth” is 
such a strong novel.

Several months ago, my answer seemed 

to be “no.”

After witnessing the catastrophic fail-

ure of “Dear Evan Hansen” — a film which 
I hated, adapted from a musical I liked (or 
at least used to like. It’s difficult to listen to 
Ben Platt since seeing the movie) — I began 
to wonder whether a musical could go from 
stage to screen without being ruined in the 
process. Thinking about others I had seen, 
I realized with some unease that every 
one I came up with had disappointed me 

somehow. “Evita” awkwardly fits songs 
and story together in a way that detracts 
from any power the film could have had. 
“Les Misérables” adds songs not from the 
original soundtrack. Both “Les Mis” and 
“The Phantom of the Opera” suffer from 
suboptimal singing (“Les Mis” being the far 
worse offender).

These movie musicals feel like they 

aren’t meant to be movies. But they also 
aren’t meant to be musicals. They are 
unable to maintain what made them work 
as musicals while justifying their existence 
as films. It was the adaptation from one 
form to the other where they struggled, 
specifically when it came to suspension of 
disbelief.

If a movie is going to be a musical, this is 

something it must contend with. On stage, 
we don’t think twice when the characters 
start singing. We have already decided 

to believe that the stage is a setting other 
than a stage (excepting, of course, musicals 
where the stage is canonical). We accept 
this just as we accept that the story is being 
told through song.

It’s not the same case with movies. Or at 

least, this acceptance isn’t as easy or auto-
matic. In “Dear Evan Hansen,” when high 
school student Evan (Ben Platt, “Pitch Per-
fect 2”) starts quietly singing at the dinner 
table in response to a question he is asked, 
it feels wrong, especially when the other 
characters continue to speak normally. It 
seems less like he is delivering the story 
through song and more like he is actually 
singing his side of the conversation to these 

people in their dining room. Much of the 
suspension of disbelief is lost in the film 
because Evan sings so much more than the 
rest of the cast.

Despite all his singing, there never 

seems to be a reason why. In musicals, 
when characters start singing in situations 
where people wouldn’t normally sing, it is 
usually because they are expressing some-
thing where words aren’t sufficient. They 
are moved to song, so to speak. But in the 
film, Evan appears to just decide to sing all 
of his thoughts, and when the other char-
acters rarely sing about their arguably more 
complicated feelings, it becomes harder to 
accept this. 

The songs themselves often don’t move 

the story forward because they lack move-
ment in a literal sense. The characters stand 
or sit in a single place while singing or move 
in a way not conducive to the song’s intend-

ed effect; for example, the original impact 
of “If I Could Tell Her,” an alleged love 
song, is lost as we watch Evan awkwardly 
stalk Zoe (Kaitlyn Dever, “Booksmart”) 
around her kitchen island like a serial killer.

I was given hope for movie musicals 

after seeing Steven Spielberg’s (“Ready 
Player One”) “West Side Story” last week. 
Unlike in “Dear Evan Hansen,” the sing-
ing in “West Side Story” doesn’t feel jarring. 
Everyone sings, for a start, and when they 
do so, it moves the story forward. When 
Anita (Ariana DeBose, “Hamilton”), joined 
by an ensemble, sings “America,” we under-
stand not only her struggles and hopes as a 
Puerto Rican immigrant, but the commu-
nity of similar people living in Manhattan. 
The film also makes use of choreography 
— absent in all but one song in “Dear Evan 
Hansen” — letting the audience know that 
they are not meant to take what is happen-
ing literally. 

When Tony (Ansel Elgort, “Baby Driv-

er”) and Maria (Rachel Zegler, debut) sing 
“Tonight,” the impression is that words 
would not have been enough to express 
how much they mean to each other. The 
song acts to persuade the audience that they 
are falling in love despite having just met. 
The musical element, the theatricality, the 
importance of music as something charac-
ters are moved to do when speaking will 
not suffice, is preserved in this movie. In 
“Dear Evan Hansen,” song simply replaces 
dialogue when Evan wants it to. “Dear 
Evan Hansen” brings singing to the screen. 
“West Side Story” brings a musical there.

This idea of bringing the theatrical ele-

ment of musicals to the screen has led to 
the success, or partial success, of other 
movie musicals as well, at least as far as sus-
pension of disbelief. “The Phantom of the 
Opera” and “Cabaret” are set in an opera 
house and (as the title suggests) a cabaret, 
respectively, where singing is a canonical 
part of the story. This makes it more natu-
ral for characters to break into song even 
when they are no longer in a scenario where 
they normally would. “Chicago” makes use 
of this as well, having most of the musical 
numbers take place on an imagined stage 
meant both to show how aspiring celebrity 
Roxie (Renée Zellweger, “Bridget Jones’s 
Baby”) imagines her life as a series of stage 
acts and to comment on the immoral work-
ings of the justice system and its relation to 
the press.

If you’ve seen the trailer for 

Paul Thomas Anderson’s (“Inher-
ent Vice”) latest film “Licorice 
Pizza,” you probably remember a 
brief snippet: two people laying 
nearly shoulder-to-shoulder on a 
waterbed, faces turned towards 
each other, silhouetted hands 
almost touching. It’s a cute, sappy 
little thing.

But in the movie, that scene 

abruptly ends with the girl fall-
ing asleep and the boy trying to 
grope her breast before changing 
his mind. 

I interpreted the moment as 

simply a reflection of his childish-
ness, his horniness. It wasn’t until 
I was talking about the film with 
my girlfriend, days after we’d seen 
it, that I questioned this. 

“What if she was faking being 

asleep?” she asked me. “Like a 
test?”

I wanted to say no, to simplify 

the scene into a transgression of 
a teenage boy, but I couldn’t. I 
wasn’t sure. That lack of certainty 
of the extent to which the two are 
aware of each other, testing each 
other, is the driving force of “Lic-
orice Pizza.” 

The truth of their relationship, 

and of “Licorice Pizza” at large, is 
complicated sometimes. 

Like many of the best Ander-

son films, the plot is nothing 
more than two infinitely interest-
ing characters colliding, finding 
themselves unable to stay away 
from one another and seeing what 
happens.

This formula (or lack thereof) is 

responsible for the tautly roman-
tic, intoxicating atmosphere of 
“Phantom Thread” and the wan-
dering ambiguity of “The Master.” 
In “Licorice Pizza,” it plays out 
in episodes of ’70s tropes woven 
together by the odd companion-
ship between 15-year-old hustler 
Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman, 
debut) and in-her-twenties-and-
still-figuring-shit-out Alana Kane 
(Alana Haim, of the rock trio 
HAIM).

Their relationship is definitely 

romantic despite their gap in age 
and life experience, but is no less 

challenging than other Anderson pairs. 
The two are mutually unsure of their 
place in each other’s lives but simulta-
neously feel more recognized together 
than they do anywhere else in the world. 

It’s precisely in these kinds of odd, 

undefined relationships where the writ-
er-director Anderson thrives; where 
his indiference toward cliché gives his 
characters an unmistakable realism. 
One of the fascinating parts of Gary and 
Alana’s relationship is the way its ambi-
guity makes it more, rather than less, 
palpable to their friends and families. 
Anderson is adamant about peripheral 
characters asking Gary if he is dating 
Alana and vice versa. Their confused 
hesitation in responding embodies the 

kind of tension that gives “Licorice 
Pizza” constant forward momentum, 
even as the plot (often hilariously) 
meanders.

The film certainly has its laughs 

— particularly an episode at prolific 
producer Jon Peters’s house that exists 
simply for Bradley Cooper (“A Star is 
Born”) to clown around in a little mullet. 
Yet the film is more efective as a study 
of two young people coming to terms 
with themselves through each other’s 
eyes than it is as a ’70s LA hangout flick. 
What I can’t stop thinking about, even 
days after my viewing, is the minutiae of 
Gary and Alana’s behavior towards each 
other, how their mutual attraction cata-
lyzes just as much frustration. 

It becomes hard not to adore how 

messy the film feels. Gone are Ander-
son’s 
signature 
frame-within-

a-frame shots: his use of doors, 
windows and other physical con-
straints of his sets to naturally 
zoom in on a scene. Everything 
here feels hazier, less concrete. 

Alana is often shot in reflec-

tions instead, like in the mirror 
along the wall of a restaurant’s 
dining area in a pivotal ending 
scene. This moment is one of the 
highlights of her performance, the 
conversation happening on either 
side of her forcing her to take in 
shocking information, while the 
shot only lets us see a dim, muted 
version of her expression.

The characters themselves are 

messy too, an indication of the 
era and the instability of grow-
ing up. The way the film includes 
the anti-Asian racism, particu-
larly pervasive in its era, paints its 
characters with gritty, sometimes 
uncomfortable depth. Much has 

been written about Jerry Frick 
(John Michael Higgins, “Pitch 
Perfect”), the white owner of a 
Japanese 
restaurant, 
breaking 

into a gross caricature of an Asian 
accent in multiple scenes. I wish 
similar attention was paid to the 
more important characters’ rac-
ist actions too — Gary complete-
ly mistakes Frick’s second wife 
Kimiko (Megumi Anjo) for his 
first wife, Mioko (Yumi Mizui), 
Alana literally bows to Kimiko 
and Gary’s mom writes a rather 
questionable marketing descrip-
tion of this restaurant, referring 
to the waitresses as “dolls.”

There’s something honest in 

this messiness. Anderson wants 
us to soak in all the details of the 
time and place in which he grew 
up, to depict people as who they 
were rather than who an audience 
might want them to be.

I’ll be the first to admit it: “Emily in 

Paris” is one of my favorite TV shows. Ever 
since the first season dropped on Netflix 
in October of 2020, I was hooked. Lily Col-
lins (“Tolkien”), gorgeous shots of France, 
a fun romance? Sign me up. I finished the 
first season’s ten episodes in record time 
and sat around waiting eagerly for season 
two — which dropped right as the Uni-
versity of Michigan went on break for the 
holidays when I’d have plenty of time to 
binge it. The show has improved in a lot 
of ways, but the second season reinforced 
some flaws as well.

“Emily in Paris,” from “Sex and the 

City” creator Darren Star, quickly became 
some of Netflix’s most-watched content, 
though not all of the attention was posi-
tive. Critics and viewers alike hated the 
countless clichés and stereotypes of the 
French. That didn’t change much in sea-
son two, as Emily’s Instagram influencer 
status became even more far-fetched. 
While going viral can happen to anyone 
at any time, the level at which it happens 
to Emily is unrealistic (something which 
users on TikTok are quick to make fun of).

One of the biggest — and most exciting 

— differences between the two seasons is 
that when Emily is not around, the French 
characters actually speak French! Who 
would have thought?

Emily’s sad attempts to practice her 

French continue to be a running joke in 
the first half of the season. In one episode, 
she tries to write Camille (Camille Razat, 
“The Accusation”), the rich Parisian who 
befriends Emily at the start of season one, 
a letter in French as an apology, but when 
read aloud it makes absolutely no sense.

The show finally gave more attention 

to minor characters like Mindy (Ash-
ley Park, “Girls5Eva”), Julien (Samuel 
Arnold, “Antony and Cleopatra”) and Syl-
vie (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, “Call My 
Agent!”). Madeline (Kate Walsh, “Grey’s 
Anatomy”), Emily’s boss in Chicago, has a 
much larger role in the second half of this 
season as well. After a surprise arrival at 
Savoir, the French marketing company 
Emily works for, Madeline uncovers a 
few business practices that the American 
workplace would consider unethical. She 

tries taking control of the French offices 
and conforming them to the style of her 
Chicago firm, only to have Sylvie quit and 
open her own firm, with her employees 
and their highest-paying clients in tow. 
Seeing Sylvie and the others walk away 
was satisfying, even though, for that 
moment in time, Emily’s job seemed up in 
the air.

One of the biggest areas where the 

season fell flat was in the romance 
department. Season one left off with a 
cliffhanger: Emily spent the night with 
Gabriel (Lucas Bravo, “Smart Ass”) before 
he leaves Paris for good, only to find out 
the next morning that he’s staying. Emily 
then got a text from Camille, her friend 
— and Gabriel’s ex-girlfriend (hence the 
need for a letter of apology). Much of the 
promotion for season two played into that 
“will they/won’t they” romance, only for 
it to appear exclusively at the very begin-
ning and very end. Emily doesn’t want to 
sacrifice her friendship with Camille in 
order to date Gabriel so she tries to stay 
away, only increasing the sexual tension 
that made their relationship so enjoyable 
the first time around. But after Camille 
finds out that they slept together, she 
stops speaking to both of them, and Emily 
suddenly moves on to Alfie (Lucien Lav-
iscount, “Katy Keene”), the handsome 
Brit in her French class. The chemistry 
between Emily and Alfie felt forced and 
was nothing compared to that between 
her and Gabriel. Emily’s relationship with 
Alfie felt like a poor excuse to let Emily 
keep speaking English without feeling 
guilty, too.

Even worse, Camille’s treatment of 

Emily is completely swept under the rug. 
Her reaction to finding out about Emily 
and Gabriel is justifiable, but she does a 
complete 180 with Emily and gets her to 
enter a “no dating Gabriel” pact only to 
take him back herself. There’s no explana-
tion as to why Camille goes behind Emily’s 
back like this (beyond Camille’s mother 
cryptically suggesting it), and after Emily 
discovers they have gotten back together, 
there isn’t any kind of confrontation. Sea-
son two ends on a similar cliffhanger to 
season one: Emily’s future with Gabriel is 
up in the air, and this time she’s the one 
who might not be staying in Paris.

The Sex Lives Of College Girls And Also Dani

DANI CANAN

Statement Correspondent

So 
lately 

I’ve 
been 

thinking about 
sex; or rather, 
thinking about 
why I don’t 
think 
about 

sex. I started 
watching 
“Criminal 

Minds” 
for 
the 

plot, 
but stayed through 

all 
15 
seasons 
for 
actor 

Matthew 
Gray 

Gubler. 
By all accounts, he 

is 
my 
celebrity crush and 

current 
phone 
lockscreen, 

yet I don’t 
think he’s “sexy.” In 

fact, 
I’ve 
never thought about 

anyone as 
being “sexy.” 

It wasn’t 
until recently that I 

gave much 
thought about the 

distinction between being “very 
attractive” and “sexy.” Perhaps that 
is just how I am, frank and slightly 
unbothered. Over the past year it has 
become one of my personal projects, 
trying to put a finger on why my 
experiences with sexuality have been 
so different from many girls my age. 
Because it has come to my attention 
that there could be an actual, 
biological reason.

This all started in my junior year of 

high school during a shift at Hungry 
Howies Pizza. My co-worker Abby, 
older by just a few years, was standing 
on the pizza line with me, prompting 
the first conversation about sexual 
orientation that I ever had. 

“Dani, who are you attracted to?” 

The orders were slow, so conversation 
was plenty. 

“Like, at work?” I began to 

get 
anxious 
about 
potential 

embarrassment. The answer was 
definitely ‘nobody.’

“No, I mean girls or boys,” Abby 

said, half chuckling as she leaned over 
to grab some pepperoni. “You don’t 
have to answer if you don’t want, but 
I decided to start asking people ever 
since I found out Nick was gay. Like, 
if he didn’t tell me, I wouldn’t have 
known.” 

Nick delivered the pizzas. I also 

didn’t know he was gay. 

It wasn’t the first time I pondered 

this question and, eyebrows furrowed, 
I always gave it serious consideration. 
I thought about women. I thought 
about Zendaya. I thought about men. I 
thought about Matthew Gray Gubler. 

“I’m pretty sure I just like guys, 

but I haven’t ever kissed anyone, and 
how do you really know until you’re 
in that situation?” I felt happy with 
that answer, but then the conversation 
ended with something I will never 
forget: “You know Dani, I wouldn’t be 
surprised if you were asexual.”

To this day I still have no idea 

what prompted her to say that, but I 
can’t get it out of my head. What I do 
understand now is that people tend to 
know before they know.

Biology wise, prokaryotic and 

eukaryotic organisms, the single 
celled and multicelled, have been 
reproducing asexually since before I 

was born, which is an understatement. 
Mitosis is likely the most basic form of 
asexual replicating. A cell makes copy 
after copy after copy after copy after 
copy of the personal information in 
the nucleus, and it then pinches apart 
in order to clone itself. Look, I even 
made this educational diagram to 
demonstrate:

Cells don’t need to worry about a 

sexual orientation before “doing the 
deed” because no partner is required. 
Also because cells don’t think about 
things. This makes sense for cells, 
which are constantly trying to make 
as many of themselves as possible in 

the quickest amount of time while 
expending the least amount of energy. 
This splitting mechanism is meant for 
survival for the species in the case of 
prokaryotes like bacteria.

The first time I looked up the 

definition of ‘asexual,’ I put my 
phone in private browsing mode –– 
if that’s any indication of how I felt 
about acting on my own reasonable 
curiosity. Youtube videos popped 
up along with blogs, unofficial 
LGBTQIA+ education sites and a 

wealth of personal testimonies. I 
spent a lot of nights scrolling through 
the comments under asexual content, 
a space where real people relayed 
their experiences in mini slices of 
life. It would be 1:13 a.m. for me in my 
small town summer, fireflies weaving 
in slow motion through the leafy 
branches outside my window, and 
I’d glow in apprehensive pulses along 
with them while reading every new 
anecdote –– real people’s real words. 

(The word “real” deserves a pause 

to grant the full weight that the word 
carries with it. Realness is tangibility, 
grazing the receptors that allow the 
body feeling, leaving a tickling trail 
down one’s arm. What you see on 
a piece of paper, r-e-a-l, is so much 
more than what the occipital lobe 
receives. The urgency of the meaning 
it contains is the heaviness of the 
physicality of any existing person, 
place, thing or idea. To be really, really 
real is to be pulled out of the brain and 
shocked into the middle of a freeway 
during a midnight storm, clothes 
instantly sopping down to the socks, 
horns and engines demonstrating the 
doppler effect 100 times over in quick 
succession, cars crashing past on polar 
opposite paths with enough force to 
whip your head in around in perfect 
180º motion, momentum spinning the 
rest of your body in suit. And anyway, 
I think the word itself has been used 
so much that people tend to lose the 
feeling of what it really means. Hang 
on. I might be part of the problem.)

I want to feel real in this way, to feel 

real with somebody in this way.

Naturally, reading through the 

experiences of others inspired me to 
reexamine some of my own. I used to 
make up fake crushes in elementary 
school, giving me something to giggle 
about with my friends at sleepovers. I 
never felt like I needed to shave my legs 
for any reason, and I wore whatever 
the hell I wanted without thinking 
about how it would make other people 
(boys) see me. I have a tendency to be 
initially oblivious to the connotations 
of “Netflix and chill,” calling a teacher 
a “silver fox,” or saying things like “I 
like sucking on nuts” (I was eating a 
bag of almonds, ok?). Perhaps most 
notably, all through middle and high 
school I repeated the same motto: 
“I just don’t see the point in dating 
anyone. No one actually knows what 
love is at our age anyway, and it won’t 
likely make it past senior year, so why 
even bother?”

The evidence began piling up, and 

the slightly bewildering part was how 
neatly pieces were fitting together.

Youtube videos and comment 

sections also lead me to research the 
different types of attraction, which 
may seem like an obvious concept, 
but you’d be surprised what you can 
discover about yourself when these 
feelings are all defined and separated 
out. I loved reading about types of 
attraction in the same way I love 
taking Buzzfeed quizzes about which 
kind of soup I am, which is to say this 
framework is a good facilitator of self 
reflection and self understanding. Not 
every source has the same categories, 
but there are six that show up often: 

intellectual 
attraction, 
emotional 

attraction, 
aesthetic 
attraction, 

sensual 
attraction, 
romantic 

attraction, 
and 
finally, 
sexual 

attraction. If someone falls on the 
spectrum of asexuality, they would 
experience sexual attraction least of 
all. As far as I can tell, I experience all 
of them except for sexual attraction.

* * *
Intellectual attraction is a magnetic 

draw toward the mind of someone 
else — a desire to hold a microscope 
to the way they think by engaging in 
discussion. Every person contains 
an entire ecosystem of thoughts 
that almost no one sees, therefore 
appreciating the complexity of each 
and every one of a person’s musings 
is an imperative. This want goes both 
ways, for if there’s an infinity in one 
there’s an infinity in the other, and this 
endeavor is more important than the 
body. Dodge, parry, contemplate. Two 
dance together in a fencing match of 
cerebral pursuit. 

“I love you and your mind.”
To return back to biology for a 

moment, I’d like to zoom out from 
mitosis and consider more of what 
eukaryotic 
organisms 
can 
do. 

Through fragmentation, a starfish can 
break off one of its legs and eventually 
it will develop into a completely new 
starfish clone. Worms can do this, too, 
with just one segment of their body. 
Plants like succulents accomplish 
a similar feat through propagation. 

‘Fear and Loathing’

in 2022’s America

VALERIJA MALASHEVICH

Statement Columnist

Almost 17 years ago today, the 

renowned 
journalist 
Hunter 
S. 

Thompson, author of the classic novel 
“Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,” shot 
himself in the head in his Colorado 
home. Following years of struggle 
with crippling health issues and bouts 
of depression, Thompson’s outlook 
on life dwindled over the years as he 
watched the era of counterculture 
and revolutionary upheaval fade from 
the American horizon, now taken 
over by mindless consumerism and 
romanticized atavism for the “good 
old days.” The passionate idealism 
that once dominated the youthful 
landscape of the United States — the 
pleas to “Make Love Not War” and the 
cries for political equality and freedom 
— had faded before Thompson’s very 
eyes, resulting in a dim reality that he 
was grossly critical of. 

Despite his dwindling optimism 

for a better future, Thompson, in his 
attempt to admonish the people that 
fed into this disillusioned society, 
had 
accidentally 
spearheaded 
a 

journalistic 
revolution 
that 
had 

the potential to beguile readers 
worldwide. His work reads like a 
lullaby for proliferant romantics, but 
cuts sharp and deep where it needs to. 

Through his writing, Thompson 

revolutionized the idea of “gonzo 
journalism,” a type of nonfiction 
narrative that becomes so altered by 
the speaker’s subjective interpretation 
that it becomes a different beast 
entirely. Placing more emphasis on 
the narrator rather than the events 
at hand, gonzo journalism allowed 
Thompson to insert his opinionated 
(and sometimes cynical) views on life 
into his writing — and fundamentally 
altered the structure of cultural 

criticism pieces. While there is 
much to be said about Thompson 
and his profound contributions to 
postmodern literature, the bulk of his 
eloquent anthropological critique is 
featured in his most infamous novel, 
“Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” 
— one that allowed the reader to 
peer inside the mind of a pessimistic 
idealist and watch his world unravel. 

Thompson, you see, started off as 

a small-time journalist, publishing 
pieces in various magazines and 
journals until Sports Illustrated 
asked him to cover a motorcycle race 
in Las Vegas, Nevada. Doped up on 
marijuana, ether, speed and anything 
else he carried around in his “briefcase 
of narcotics,” Thompson instead 
presented an almost 3,000-word long 
‘gonzo’ piece that was immediately 
rejected by Sports Illustrated. 

The Rolling Stone magazine, 

however, believed in Thompson’s 
limitless potential and sent him 
back to Vegas to cover the District 
Attorney’s anti-narcotics convention. 
The cumulative result of Thompson’s 
composition was a belligerently 
stimulating 
yet 
philosophically 

ravishing novel titled “Fear and 
Loathing in Las Vegas,” later made 
into a film starring Johnny Depp and 
Benicio Del Toro, and becoming a cult 
classic among the fan community, 
myself included. 

I will admit — I had watched 

the movie long before I had ever 
considered picking up the book, 
but the film began to feel like a 
drug, drawing me in further and 
further until I couldn’t resist reading 
Thompson’s writing firsthand. The 
narrative, in both formats, is just as 
unintelligible and meaningless as one 
might predict, but the beauty, for me, 
lies in the revelations of Thompson’s 

didactic monologues and finally 
feeling the irascibility that he felt. Just 
like most viewers, I did not exactly 
comprehend the plot correctly the 
first time around. But, like a good 
painting, Thompson’s works must be 
studied under a microscope, where 
the beauty is not found in the sum of 
the parts, but the parts themselves.

The novel is a roman à clef of 

Thompson’s 
own 
adventures, 
a 

fictional piece that features real events 
and real people with fake names. 
Narrated in the first person, the reader 
closely follows Raoul Duke (Hunter 
Thompson’s transplant within the 
novel) and his Samoan lawyer, Dr. 
Gonzo, as they wreak havoc in Las 
Vegas and on the people around them, 
all while ingesting almost-lethal levels 
of LSD, adrenochrome and other 
narcotics. Mentally and physically 
strung up by the free-spirited period of 
the 60s, Duke hopelessly tries to keep 
the era alive with virtually no success. 
Toward the end of the novel, Duke 
finds himself reflecting on the bygone 
era of counterculture, remarking how 
foolish those “pathetically eager acid 
freaks” were for thinking they could 
buy peace and understanding for 
three bucks a hit.

To the unlearned bookworm, 

“Fear and Loathing” reads like a 
usurpation of modern values, a 300-
page long hallucinogenic trip that 
promotes nothing but drug abuse and 
ceaseless hedonism. But to the trained 
eye, Thompson’s novel is a much 
more harrowing piece that mourns 
as much as it celebrates. It illustrates 
a glistening utopia that was once just 
out of our reach; the new reality of 
our America has faded to some kind 
of mangled beast, a distorted present 
where no one cares about anything 
or anyone — a reality that Thompson 

couldn’t live with. 

Whenever I pick up “Fear and 

Loathing,” I am ultimately entranced 
by Thompson’s manipulation of 
perception and his immersive reality. 
There is an intangible component 
of his writing that adapts and molds 
to the reader, urging change from 
within. Perhaps it lights that spark 
in the rebellious part of my soul, one 
that (I hope) exists in all of us. As the 
recently passed novelist Joan Didion 
once wrote, “our favorite people and 
our favorite stories become so not by 
an inherent virtue, but because they 
illustrate something deep in the grain, 
something 
unadmitted.” 
Didion, 

much like Thompson, was also 
somewhat of a “counter-journalist,” 
intent on critiquing the socio-cultural 
aspects of current America through 
emphasis on racial and sociological 
components.

Attracting a strictly dichotomous 

crowd of either blind haters or 
intrigued 
admirers, 
Thompson’s 

“Fear and Loathing” comments on a 
hopeless time much like our own. An 
era plagued by Nixon, the Vietnam 
war, and the resurgent energy crisis, 
the ’70s turned its back to all the good 
the pioneers of the decade before it 
had hoped to achieve; the dream that 
figures like Martin Luther King Jr., 
Che Guevara and Cesar Chavez once 
held that dwindled to a soft flame and 
then went out. Thompson watched 
the backbone of America degrade to 
an unimaginable state, a complete 180 
from the period that boasted peace 
and perseverance.

By the turn of the new millennia, 

the energy and excitement that had 
once snowballed into a potential 
current for change had been shattered 
into smithereens, resulting in a 
conservative, winner-takes-all-and-

leaves-none-to-rot individualism that 
swept the 2000s. Social Darwinism 
became the new collectivism, and the 
ultimate badge one could wear would 
illustrate how many hours of your life 
you had devoted to capitalist crusades 
and covert cupidity.

Wall Street. 9/11. War on Terror. 
Thompson fell further into his 

depression, remarking that 67 was 
too decrepit of an age to live to, 17 
years past the ultimate prime. He shot 
himself in the head in the dull month 
of February, while on the phone 
with his wife. Although he didn’t live 
long enough to see the days of the 
2008 recession, or the weekly school 
shootings, or the deplorable Trump 
era, Thompson had predicted it all. 

The 2020’s. The time is our own. 

Our Nixon is Trump, our cigarette 
crisis is the Juul epidemic, our country 
still hates immigrants but loves 
gerrymandering, and our ambition is 
still fruitless. 

Still, even a broken clock is right 

twice a day. 

Following the events of the COVID-

19 pandemic, our nation has witnessed 
another rise in counterculturalism 
and revolutionary idealism. Our 
generation is hungry for something 
more, 
something 
independent, 

something radical. In a time when 
college students can no longer dream 
of owning a house, funding their own 
education, or attaining a retirement 
fund, the rise of counterculture greets 
us once again.

When I entered elementary school, 

I was told that I would be able to 
reap all the sweet fruits of life if only 
I would work hard toward my goals 
and maintain self-discipline. It was 
a mirage, I think. Because today, I 
am standing in the middle of a moral 
desert, gripping on to those empty 

promises that were once whispered in 
my ears. The fact of the matter is, many 
of us have nothing to show for our 
subordination to societal standards. 
I am an immigrant, so college was 
never an option for me — it was a 
necessity. Yet, the degree I am earning 
now might be unable to support me 
in the way I originally intended it to. I 
am a woman, so having control of my 
own reproductive and bodily rights 
is of utmost importance to me. Yet, I 
read about Roe v. Wade potentially 
being overturned every week. Our 
generation follows the comedown 
of a gilded tragedy, rewards once 
promised but never bestowed — but 
don’t think we haven’t noticed.

Young people across the nation 

have, once again, become outspoken 
about the things they care about most: 
economic inequality, police brutality, 
women’s rights and proliferating 
racism. Perhaps as a reaction to the 
desolate reality our parents had to live 
through, our generation has cyclically 
reached another era of sweeping 
change — and the pressing urge to 
realize what our predecessors could 
not. 

Yes, I think “Fear and Loathing” 

was intended to be an apprehensive 
warning for future generations; 
however, 
Thompson’s 
ideology 

stood for much more than gross 
antagonism. He spoke of optimism, 
of riding high and beautiful waves of 
change, of eloquent absurdism and 
of his own incapacities. Thompson 
was one of the pioneers of a new era 
of postmodernism, literature that 
attempts to comment on society much 
more than it tries to emulate it.

In the past few months, I have 

developed the habit of instinctually 
tapping my thumbs against my other 
fingers, as if I’m pantomiming a crab, 
or my hand is a pair of tongs grabbing 
at a piece of air. 

I think I adopted this mannerism 

as an iteration of something my 
friend Emily does, who got it from my 
friend Aviva. When they’re excited 
to see each other, their forearms fold 
upward and they rotate their hands 
and wrists with their fingers in a fist, 
in a celebration of mutual recognition. 
When I imitate them, I tap my fingers 
together, my arm folded upward on 
itself, with my fingernails pointing to 

the sky. The conclusion of the motion 
is reminiscent of the hand in the chef’s 
kiss expression.

I’m not exactly sure what put 

this into my emotive vocabulary 
other than that it’s fun to pick up 
expressions from one’s friends. I have 
noticed myself tapping my fingers 
together more regularly, usually when 
something is particularly satisfying 
or memorable. They pressed each 
other to grab at the air when I stepped 
out onto my back porch and saw the 
white traces of the first snowfall of 
the season, and they seeked to lift the 
words off the page when I reached the 
ending of a short story that shifted my 
perspective. They picked at the chords 
of a song that caught me by surprise, 
and sometimes remembering the way 
a brick building looks against a blue 

sky ten years ago is enough to prompt 
my fingerprints together.

***
When I was ten or eleven, teetering 

on the fulcrum between elementary 
school and adolescence, my parents 
signed my brother and I up for a day 
camp at our local Humane Society, 
a national organization of animal 
shelters. Inspired by our pet cat, Penny, 
we were to attend the Cat and Bunny 
Training camp at the Society’s West 
Michigan branch. Hopes and dreams 
of converting our cat from a wayward, 
kitchen-counter-wanderer to a living 
room star evolved quickly, and we 
imagined her leaping over couches 
and ottomans with grace. This would 
become even more marvelous once 
we told others that Penny was 13 years 
old, a feline senior citizen. We would 

prove our case against those that 
called cats untrainable and develop a 
repertoire of tricks that would be the 
envy of all.

Our father drove us out to the 

camp’s location, at the animal shelter 
tucked in a dull office park near the 
expressway. We walked up to the 
brick building under a June blue sky, 
and checked in at the front desk. My 
brother and I were sent down the 
linoleum corridor to the multipurpose 
room where, upon opening the double 
doors, we were greeted with the 
echoing voices of dozens of seven to 
twelve-year-olds. The counselors, 
high schoolers simply in need of 
community service hours, tried to 
herd all of us into chairs at the long 
folding tables — but order was not 
truly restored until the woman in 

charge of the camp, Ms. Ashley, 
stepped into the room. Reminiscent 
of a principal striding into a rowdy 
school cafeteria, she first decried the 
noise level but then welcomed us “to 
the first ever Cat and Bunny training 
camp!”

Announcing this before the glossy 

stares of eighty school-age children 
suddenly made Ms. Ashley aware of 
the difficulties this first-time effort 
would entail. Could she really promise 
these kids the skills to train their cats 
and rabbits to sit, stay and roll over? 

Her admittances of “we’ve never 

done this before” and “we’ll see how 
this turns out” certainly did not garner 
confidence within the crowded room; 
the high school counselors still dazed 
with the task of training children to sit 
and stay themselves. Nevertheless, we 

would set out to do what we signed up 
for, and after Ms. Ashley’s not-quite-
inspirational speech, the room was 
split up by table group and we were 
sent off to the next activity. 

Activities at Cat and Bunny 

Training Camp varied by day, but all 
were accompanied by the overtones of 
the noxious smell of animal waste and 
a chorus of dissonant meows. Near 
the end of the week, we mainly just 
pet the bunnies and kittens, and fed 
them under the burnt-out guidance of 
program staff. 

In the beginning, however, a 

genuine effort was made to educate 
and indoctrinate the rabbits and cats 
on various commands in the English

I read the “Twilight” Saga out of 

order so my mom wouldn’t know 
what I was up to. I was in the sixth 
grade, a time in my life when if I 
wanted to access the Internet to pirate 
a book — or even look up the saga’s 
correct ordering — I had to sit down at 
the massive desktop computer in my 
kitchen before my entire family. Even 
in the unlikely event that the kitchen 
was vacant, the constant hum of the 
computer would surely expose me, 
alerting someone that I was online. 
Not happening. I was left guessing 
about the characters’ origin stories 
and relationships before I realized I 
had skipped an entire book. 

Years later, I would learn from 

mom that she didn’t even own a 
copy of the first book. Our next-
door neighbor had fallen victim to 
Twilight-mania and insisted my mom 
borrow her copy; a few days later my 
mom ordered “New Moon” without 

even finishing “Twilight.” 

I read “New Moon” in the nook 

between my twin-sized bed and my 
room’s lavender walls, careful to 
conceal my reading. After finishing 
the series (and going back to read 
“Twilight,” courtesy of my local 
library), I feigned ignorance to every 
reference toward the books and acted 
disinterested at any suggestion that I 
read them. Simultaneously enthralled 
and unimpressed, I couldn’t get 
through the novels fast enough, but 
was also hesitant to cash in on any of 
the cultural capital — or lack thereof, 
depending on who you asked — that 
came with them. I wanted to say I 
had read the books everyone was 
talking about, but didn’t want to 
endure detracting remarks from 
critics. “Why would you read that?” 
“You know that they’re not any good, 
right?” Maybe I was in a “not like 
other girls phase,” where I rejected 
anything marketed toward women 
and felt silly for picking the books up 
in the first place. Maybe I just didn’t 

like “Twilight.” 

By 2011, around the time I was 

reading the books, the “Twilight 
saga” had sold over 120 million 
copies and turned into a blockbuster 
film franchise. It had also received 
widespread criticism for its portrayal 
of 
toxic 
relationships, 
religious 

undertones and appropriation of 
indigenous culture. In 2009 and 
2010 it made the American Library 
Association’s list of most commonly 
banned books. Simultaneously loved 
and hated, the media couldn’t stop 
talking about “Twilight.” 

Young adult fantasy-romance was 

admittedly not to my usual taste; 
I was in the middle of a love affair 
with historical fiction at the time, 
and basically all I read was “Little 
House on the Prairie” knock-offs. 
I’m not sure if I would’ve picked up 
the saga if it hadn’t been all around 
me. I remember classmates wearing 
“Twilight” merchandise in sixth 
grade and their impassioned fights 
over Team Jacob vs Team Edward. 
I was eleven, I wasn’t even the 
franchise’s target demographic. It 
was nearly impossible to exist in the 
late 2000’s without absorbing some 
knowledge of it. 

After the media frenzy died down, 

it seemed like the saga was destined 
to die the same quiet death most mid-
2000s young adult novels did. A whole 
era of teen literature — ranging from 
major successes like “The Hunger 
Games” to mediocre variations on 
stories like “Divergent” — became 
media empires, immortalized in film 
and merchandise, only to quietly 

fade into pop-culture obscurity. 
The merch goes on clearance, the 
discourse dies down, something else 
takes its place.

Then 
came 
the 
Twilight 

Renaissance. A catch-all term for 
the series reemergence, the Twilight 
Renaissance was sparked by fan’s 
creativity and unapologetic love for 
the saga. 

Despite my ambivalence toward 

the original saga, I was an early 
convert to the second wave of 
“Twilight” hysteria. In my mid-
teens, about three years after I read 
“Twilight,” I was border-line addicted 
to Tumblr, but felt a weird sense of 
shame about being on the platform. 
I hardly mentioned the hours I spent 
working on my blog making GIFs, 
themes and text posts to any of my 
real-life friends. Tumblr was also 
where I accidentally discovered that a 
“Twilight” community was still alive 
and thriving. I began seeing posts 
from 
@keepingupwiththecullens 

on my dashboard, a blog that bravely 
asks “what if twilight [sic] were a 
trashy reality show?” The blog edited 
the movie cast into Kardashian-style 
confessionals, perfectly combining 
the absurdity of the original books 
and reality TV. It was funny and 
nostalgic, it breathed life into 
some of the flatter moments and 
characters. I was hooked. 

Some writers have traced the 

Twilight Renaissance back to 
May 2020, when Stephanie Meyer

I stab my 
friends

Few people have seen me quite 

as messy like the captain of the foil 
fencing squad has. She’s seen me 
dissociated at parties after a single shot 
of vodka, glitter on both of our eyes, 
making conversation about shared 
Irish heritage to ground me without 
even knowing. She’s seen me gasping 
for air after a bout, telling me to guard 
my highline to stop getting stabbed in 
the neck. She’s seen me crying outside 
of the Sports Colusium, disclosing 
incidents of sexual harassment.

I joined the fencing team in fall 

2019, having never touched a weapon 
before. By the end of the first practice, 
sweating more than I ever had in my 
life in a claustrophobically hot gym, I 
decided these were my people here on 
this campus. For somewhere between 
six and nine hours a week, fencing was 
my safe place — a place to be angry and 
stressed, a place to take out aggression 
and to laugh harder than I had any 
other time that week.

***
There is a certain mindset that 

you have to tap into the moment you 
step on the fencing strip. No matter 
how many touches your opponent 
gets, no matter how far behind you 
are, the bout — the three minutes 
(or five touches) you spend facing 
an opponent — isn’t over until the 
referee calls the final touch. In short, 
you make every touch count. You do 
not think about the score; you act as if 
each round is the only round.

It is a mindset that works in two 

ways. If you are behind in touches, 
and it seems impossible to win the 
bout, you don’t give up. You stay 
concentrated. Your opponent could 
get overconfident and slip up, leaving 
the target area open. Likewise, if 
you are ahead in touches, you can’t 
get cocky. A single moment could 
be the difference between having a 
formidable lead and your opponent 

closing the gap.

It also works to keep you grounded 

in the moment because time seems 
to move differently on the strip. 
Notoriously, there was an Olympic 
fencing bout with one second left on 
the clock that continued on for several 
more minutes. Seconds stretch out, 
and three minutes feels never ending. 
Five points feels impossible. But you 
can’t think about that. You can only 
think about the next touch. 

I’ve heard the sport described as 

physical chess. Sometimes it feels like 
that — planning your attack five steps 
ahead. Sometimes it feels just like 
you’re just trying to stay on your feet 
until the bout is over.

***
While every second on the strip 

counts, club sports as a whole are 
a different story. Club sports on 
the University’s campus are often 
overlooked. As a Big Ten school, really 
the only sports anyone pays much 
attention to are varsity sports, mostly 
football and basketball. Occasionally 
swimming will get a mention. 
Maybe soccer or hockey is noted. 
But nowhere on The Michigan Daily 
website is there a tab for club sports; 
you have to search for tidbits. 

Despite 
being 
incredibly 

competitive, having won the Big Ten 
title in 2019 and the bronze medal in 
NCAA championships in the same 
year, the rowing team only has 4 pages 
worth of content dedicated to their 
sport. Most of the other club sports 
are not mentioned at all. Fencing, 
which won the USACFC national title 
in 2019, hasn’t been mentioned by The 
Michigan Daily since 2006. I’m not 
bitter.

There are 30 club sports at the 

University, but I’d be willing to bet 
the vast majority of students here

8 — Wednesday, January 19, 2022 

Several years ago as a new student, 

I was blessed with an “aha” moment 
in recognizing an extension of my 
personal identity. For me, the feel-
ing of incorporating terms and labels 
that I was previously oblivious to, but 
click immediately upon hearing them, 
is unparalleled. A series of extensive 
personal information forms, frequent 
engagement with an affinity group, or 
another spontaneous event can lead 
to reconsidering and discovering ter-
minology that helps us better express 
the identities that encompass our indi-
vidual being. 

One such identity that isn’t imme-

diately apparent for select individuals, 
including myself, is their first-genera-
tion college student status. First-gens 
are typically known as students who 
are the first in their families to attend 
college. The criteria for some defini-
tions vary according to differences 
in where one’s parent or guardian 
received their degree or the level of 
education obtained, like an associates 
degree or a bachelor’s degree. The Uni-
versity of Michigan’s official definition 
of first-generation college student — 
which coincides with the definition 
that most colleges have set forth — is 
a student whose parents did not com-
plete a four-year college degree. On 
the other hand, low-income college 
students are generally defined accord-
ing to Pell Grant status, but similar 
definitions are also based on assets and 
institution-specific income thresholds. 

First-gen students are likely to give 

a variety of answers when asked about 
when they first became cognizant of 
their status. Some were aware of the 
delineation of their identities prior to 
applying to colleges, whereas others 
were informed in the midst of their 
higher education journey. FAFSA 
applications, discussions with parents 
about the future and a sense of bewil-
derment in a new environment can all 
serve as factors that lead to this rev-
elation about how their identity is per-
ceived within institutions. 

As I was transferring from my pre-

vious university, I was able to form 
a foundational set of criteria that I 
expected from my institutions to 
facilitate a true sense of community 
for first-generation students. Among 
other things, I primarily sought a colle-
giate institution with consistent, dedi-
cated support and outreach towards 
first-gens. Upon googling “umich first 
gens,” I found the University of Michi-
gan to be much more robust compared 
to other schools in terms of first-gen 

specific resources, support and rec-
ognition. The First-Gen Gateway and 
the Go Blue Guarantee were several 
notable markers of the university’s 
commitment and ongoing progress.

As I became more immersed in 

the first-gen landscape, one term that 
sprang up from time to time was FGLI. 
FGLI stands for “first-generation, low-
income” and is generally pronounced 
as either “fly,” “figly,” or the letters 
enunciated individually. FGLI serves 
as an umbrella term that not only 
achieves brevity in the context of advo-
cacy and discourse, but also serves as a 
point of reference for individuals who 
identify as part of this community. The 
term itself may seem trivial, but having 
a qualitative phrase to affiliate with is 
of paramount importance, especially 
since first-gen and low-income iden-
tities are often left unrecognized or 
overlooked entirely. Although many, 
including myself, might take the Uni-
versity’s frequent advertising efforts 
for granted, the absence of any effort 
is abysmal and unfortunately the norm 
at other collegiate institutions. Even a 
granular “1ST GEN” sticker plastered 
onto a laptop is a momentous mile-
stone and sign of progress. While the 
visibility and recognition of FGLI stu-
dents through the perfunctory use and 
presence of terms like FGLI, first-gens 
and low-income makes me feel seen, it 
is undeniably still a first step. 

The adoption of these terms is by 

no means an indicator that all is well. 
The University has made considerable 
progress in terms of accommodating 
FGLI students, but there is still room 
for improvement. Although there are 
university-wide resources and sup-
port, there are only a few schools with-
in the institution that offer tailored 
FGLI-specific resources. For example, 
the College of Engineering maintains 
its own dedicated set of resources for 
its FGLI students, such as the First 
Generation Engineers (1st Gen Engin) 
club. These tailored resources — or the 
absence of them — can make or break 
a FGLI student’s experience within 
their respective school.

Even the existence of the FGLI 

identifier cannot resolve some discrep-
ancies on its own such as the sparse 
FGLI representation and involvement 
in professional and selective organiza-
tions. Moreover, some students may 
choose not to self-identify as FGLI 
or may feel that other components of 
their identity are of greater salience to 
them, leading them to place the FGLI 
term and resources on their periphery.

I aptly dubbed last fall, my first 

in-person semester as a University 
of Michigan transfer student, the 
semester of learning and unlearn-
ing. How do I operate living on 
my own? What notions do I leave 
behind in my metro Detroit sub-
urb? Which ideals and values are 
significant to me, and to what 
degree?

I unlearned the streets of my 

childhood hometown. I learned 
the ins and outs of my little cor-
ner on Forest Avenue. Some may 
argue I unlearned good driving 
by walking everywhere (I‘d argue 
against that claim), and some may 
(correctly) say that I learned the 
perfect method of defrosting my 
mom’s food. Beyond getting to 
know myself and my campus more, 
I’ve navigated critically unlearn-
ing my previous indifference to 
problematic norms of wokeness 
— namely current corporate diver-
sity initiatives. Before transferring 
to the Ross School of Business, I 
had nothing to do with the sphere 
of business, so I just pointed and 
laughed at its disingenuous social 
awareness from a distance. But 
once my immersion into the busi-
ness sphere truly began within my 
first couple classes of the previous 
semester at Ross, a disruptive seed 
was planted into my mind that 
watered and watered into fully 
bloomed animosity, growing from 
distinct phases of being bemused to 
irked, to ultimately disillusioned. 
The tipping point was when a shirt 
was handed to me in the basement 
of, ironically, the Trotter Multi-
cultural Center emblazoned with 
big, bold, maize text that read “I 
AM DEI.” What’s free is free, so 
I took the shirt; it’s since become 
a comfy bedtime staple. I wore it 
once when my friend was over, and 
with a mortified stare, she asked, 
“You’re never going to wear that in 
public, right?”

She was right. I knew I never 

would— the words “I AM DEI” 
immediately rang tone-deaf in a 
way that I couldn’t quite articulate. 
Tokenizing? Hasty? Grandiose? 
Performative? The magnitude of 
my discomfort at the shirt couldn’t 
be summarized in a few words, 
but served as a microcosm of my 
irritation throughout the semes-
ter at being inundated with lingo, 
jargon and pretty-little-nothings 

about the overused yet under-
mined phrase “diversity, equity, 
and inclusion,” always devoid of 
any real action to address what 
consistently has perpetuated rac-
ist oppression: global hypercapi-
talism.

It’s undeniable that an education 

in business would showcase some 
pitfalls of the modern synthesis 
of business and wokeness. Dur-
ing the fall semester of my junior 
year at Ross, students take the 
highest concentration of required 
courses in what’s dubbed the Ross 
Integrative Semester, or RIS. Each 
year, there are several preselected 
RIS themes centered on creat-
ing business solutions with posi-
tive impact, and this fall’s themes 
were inclusive learning; transpar-
ent and inclusive workspaces; and 
support for physical and mental 
wellness. Immediately within the 
first couple weeks of class, there 
was no question that attempts at 
an image of social consciousness 
were sprinkled throughout most, 
if not all, of my courses — and 
while they may possibly have been 
well-intentioned, were rendered 
ultimately feeble and insufficient. 
Common terminology for assign-
ments included phrasing like: 
“investigate a socially-conscious 
venture,” “discuss the triple bot-
tom line” and “create a business 
plan that addresses inclusivity 
and transparency.” At face value, it 
seems as though the Ross commu-
nity is a pioneer of “positive busi-
ness” — the often discussed, yet 
infrequently realized utilization of 
business principles and practices 
to create solutions mitigating soci-
etal ills and promoting the great-
er good. Delving a little deeper 
though, this facade is easily broken 
by Ross’s lack of any tangible com-
mitment to racial equity. Ross, for 

example, is one of the few schools 
in the University that doesn’t 
require a Race & Ethnicity course. 
Instead, what we do have is a sin-
gle class period in a required Man-
agement & Organization course 
devoted to (slightly, kinda, not 
really) discussing Ava DuVernay’s 
2016 documentary “13th.” The film 
touches on a wide breadth of issues 
related to the U.S.’s historical rac-

ism and oppression of the Black 
community through the prison 
system, and how it’s perpetuated 
by the active role of business inter-
ests within the prison-industrial 
complex. Thus, “13th” can help act 
as a springboard for a genuine dis-
cussion, but our conversation on its 
content was whittled down to 10 
minutes of one class period. This 
brief discussion, in my experience, 
largely consisted of participation-
point comments like “I had no idea 
the system was this bad!” and “it’s 
just so shocking,” centering their 
harrowed regret at past ignorance 
instead of truly unpacking the role 
that our goals as business students 
play in societal issues the film 
presents. 

We quickly touched on the role 

of business in the prison-industrial 
complex for a couple minutes, and 
this seemed to pass as proper DEI 
learning to administrators, faculty 
and some students.

Social Media or 

Marketplace? A look at 
Instagram’s Interface

While I hate to admit it, 

checking my Instagram feed 
has become a subconscious part 
of my daily routine. From day 
to day, the content is generally 
similar — a few photo dumps, 
posts from my favorite musi-
cians and maybe some funny 
memes on my friends’ sto-
ries. One thing that especially 
remains consistent is the copi-
ous amounts of ads I receive on 
a daily basis. Every time I open 
Instagram, I can guarantee 
there will always be countless 
products ready to be marketed 
to me. This feels incredibly far 
removed from the way Insta-
gram functioned when I first 
downloaded the app at age 13. 

My first encounter with Ins-

tagram was in 2014 when I cre-
ated my account as a middle 
schooler who simply wanted 
to share memes and fun photos 
with friends. At the time, Ins-
tagram had minimal function-
ality; a user could really only 
post one photo at a time and 
share them through direct mes-
sages. Posting to my feed was 
a trivial hobby that didn’t take 
much thought or effort. Just 
like all social media sites, Ins-
tagram has undergone a pleth-
ora of significant updates since 
its initial launch, including an 
infamous logo change in 2016, 
and the ability to include mul-
tiple photos in a single post in 
2018. The most notable change 
in recent years was an update 
in late 2020 that rearranged 
the navigation bar to promote 

Instagram’s video feed, Reels, 
and their shopping page, Shop, 
in place of the Compose and 
Activity buttons. While this 
may just seem like an annoy-
ing inconvenience to Instagram 
users, there are underlying 
implications about pushing an 
eerily similar TikTok competi-
tor and a shopping page to the 
front of the app. 

As a company, changing their 

interface is far more lucrative 
for Instagram because it nudges 
users to shop through their app 
more than ever before. When 
users buy goods from sellers 
directly through the app, Ins-
tagram takes a 5% commission 
from every single sale made on 
their Shop. Meanwhile, Reels 
have now become one of Ins-
tagram’s primary features as 
a direct response to TikTok’s 
ever-growing platform. TikTok 
has roughly a billion monthly 
users and Reels emerged as Ins-
tagram’s attempt to keep users 
from fleeing their app entirely. 
With the navigation bar update, 
Reels is the centerpiece of the 
app, with the Shop as its sec-
ondary feature. To even make 
a post, a user must tap a small 
button in the upper right cor-
ner of their feed or profile 
tabs. Such an interface change 
doesn’t seem fitting for what 
Instagram is supposed to be: a 
photo-sharing app. Complicat-
ing the photo-sharing process 
in such a way implies that post-
ing your photos or videos is just 
an afterthought compared to all 
the superfluous new features.

022. As every new year 
does, 2022 presents the 
chance to start fresh. 
A little over a month 

ago, my favorite soccer team, 
Manchester 
United, 
replaced 

head coach and club legend Ole 
Gunnar Solskjaer with a German 
manager, a first in the club’s 143-
year history. A fortnight before 
Christmas Eve, the Indian cricket 
team adopted split captaincy for 
the first time. This was uncharted 
territory for India, a country that 
loves cricket. Before the clock 
struck 12 on Dec. 31, we saw the 
University of Michigan compete 
in the College Football Playoff for 
the first time since the playoff’s 
creation, generating a new era for 
a roster and coach its adoring fan 
base can finally rally behind. As 
the three teams my life revolves 
around entered new phases of 
their journey, I was served a 
stark reminder that sports is a 
cut-throat industry. It’s made 
up of individuals who are under 
pressure and expected to deliver, 
on and off the pitch. Hence, they 
often quickly learn an art that 
many take years to master: the art 
of dealing with change.

Change 
is 
a 
phenomenon 

that 
many, 
including 
myself, 

find difficult to deal with, but 
it is one that is often inevitable. 
An amygdala hijack refers to a 
situation where the brain senses 
danger and immediately orders 
the body to react in a way that 
might counteract that danger. 
Change is one such trigger that 
the brain might consider a threat, 
which 
is 
why 
many 
people 

often resist even the smallest 
of changes; be it getting used to 

a new morning coffee shop or 
traveling halfway across the world 
to complete your undergraduate 
studies in a significantly colder 
and significantly smaller city than 
the one you grew up in. Everybody 
has their own reasons for avoiding 
change, but most of us would 
also agree that change is not only 
required, but more often than not, 
it is beneficial. So, as the new year 
begins, how can we better equip 
ourselves to cope with the changes 
that it will bring?

Emerson 
Human 
Capital 

Consulting, a company that aims to 
help firms get the most out of their 
employees, cites Gleicher’s formula 
as a way to help people deal with 
change. The formula focuses on 
the idea of dissatisfaction with the 
way things currently are, a picture 
of a better tomorrow and taking the 
initial steps toward making that 
vision a reality. A dissatisfaction 
with the performance of the U-M 
football team, an image of what 
Manchester United football club 
should stand for and making the 
decision to split the Indian cricket 
team’s captaincy are all examples 
of Gleicher’s formula being used by 
athletic institutions at the highest 
level, and it’s not difficult to see 
why. A big part of resisting change 
is being tied to the past. Why would 
anybody want to try a new coffee 
shop if the current one added an 
extra shot of caramel and threw 
in a cookie on the house every now 
and then? Why go through the 
hassle of adapting to something 
new when you can keep things the 
way they are? 

Nostalgia is a powerful tool, 

one that fuels my devotion to the 
things and people I love. It keeps 
me connected to them and gives 
me a reason to keep going. Because 
of this, when I’m in a situation 
where greener pastures are within 

sight, I hesitate. I’m afraid of an 
eventuality where I look back 
and regret. When I flew out of 
Mumbai — my hometown — and 
into Ann Arbor for my college 
experience, I promised myself that 
I would embrace the change with 
an open mind. I promised myself 
that I wouldn’t look back and Dr. 
Strange my way into alternate 
realities, trying to imagine what 
would have happened if I hadn’t 
left. I’m a pretty dramatic person, 
and I like to treat my life like 
it’s one long movie, so I posted 
a picture on Instagram to mark 
this moment. Within the post’s 
comments, I found the people that 
mattered over the last 19 years. I 
instantly found comfort in the idea 
that even though I might not see 
them or meet with them as often, 
they’d always be there. Being back 
home over winter break further 
solidified that belief. It changed 
the way I perceive change.

New beginnings are like a 

messy desktop, with everything 
from jpegs and tiffs to pdf and 
docx files. Taking the next step 
in your journey is like dumping 
all of those files into one folder, 
often lazily named “Desktop” or 
something. It doesn’t mean that 
the files within are forgotten, and 
it doesn’t mean that they don’t 
matter. In fact, they matter a little 
too much (which is why they aren’t 
in the trash). They’re in that new 
folder because if the desktop ever 
gets too messy again, and it will, 
everything you’ve been through 
before will literally be a click of a 
button away. Not only does that 
give me the power to face change, 
but it also makes me excited for it. 
The last four months, my first four 
in Ann Arbor, have shown me the 
wonders that change can do and 
make me compelled to say: here’s 
to 2022.

A

dam McKay, the director 
of childhood classics such 
as “Step Brothers” and 

“The Other Guys,” along with more 
recent, politically-conscious films 
such as “The Big Short” and “Vice,” 
has a new movie: “Don’t Look 
Up.” It’s about a pair of Michigan 
State University (I know, yuck) 
astronomers trying to stop a comet 
from wiping out the human race. 
Spoiler alert: The comet represents 
climate change. “Don’t Look Up” is 
McKay’s attempt at showing that 
climate change is an extinction-
level threat. The film itself, though, 
represents 
climate 
advocates’ 

continued inability to focus on the 
crisis without being distracted by 
other political issues. 

The 
biggest 
problem 
with 

McKay’s newest film, according 
to critics, is that it isn’t just about 

climate change. “Don’t Look Up” 
features biting criticism of social 
media-obsessed 
culture, 
the 

greedy military-industrial complex 
and the hedonism a little fame can 
bring out in an otherwise humble 
midwestern 
professor. 
It 
also 

highlights the unnerving power 
massive corporations have over our 
government and our personal lives. 
One reviewer calls the film “a blunt 
instrument in lieu of a sharp razor.” 
McKay doesn’t focus on climate 
change alone; he panders to a suite 
of progressive priorities. 

McKay’s willingness to subdue 

his message on climate change in 
favor of broader left-wing activism 
is not a phenomenon in filmmaking 
alone. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio 
Cortez’s, D-N.Y., Green New Deal 
was denounced by so many in part 
because it contains a plethora of 
progressive promises completely 
unrelated to the staving off of 
global catastrophe. Guaranteeing 

a living wage, universal healthcare 
and ending discrimination against 
numerous groups are certainly 
noble causes, but none of them 
pose the same existential threat as 
a warming climate. Furthermore, 
conservatives’ 
ideology 
and 

constituencies bar them from even 
considering a bill with so many 
progressive priorities. That means 
opponents can stop a bill like the 
Green New Deal without directly 
confronting climate science. 

Robinson Meyer recently voiced 

similar criticism of the Build Back 
Better Act: “What is so frustrating 
is that the largest disputes over the 
bill aren’t about climate policy.” 
Indeed, the cost of Build Back 
Better — something Sens. Joe 
Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten 
Sinema, D-Ariz., are particularly 
concerned about — is found mainly 
in the social programs. The climate 
provisions in the House-passed 
Build Back Better Act total around 

$500 billion, well within the two 
senators’ preferred $1.75 trillion 
limit. In fact, Manchin reportedly 
offered White House negotiators 
$500 billion to $600 billion in 
climate spending in his own 
proposal.

Beyond harming the feasibility 

of congressional action, lumping 
climate change advocacy with 
other liberal priorities politicizes 
the crisis and the science behind it. 
This is something “Don’t Look Up” 
exemplifies as well. CNN’s Holly 
Thomas recently penned an article 
about the film’s tendency to mix 
science with liberalism in general, 
calling it a “critical mistake.” 
Similarly, when conservatives see 
climate change programs as a part 
of a larger liberal package, they 
see climate change as a part of the 
Democratic platform, not scientific 
fact. 

Thomas points to Dr. Anthony 

Fauci’s desire to remain apolitical 

early in the COVID-19 pandemic 
as further proof. As Republican 
politicians began to label Fauci 
as partisan, trust in him as an 
authority on the pandemic shrank. 
Similarly, when diligent adherence 
to COVID-19 restrictions became 
more associated with Democrats, 
the 
science 
motivating 
these 

decisions became less relevant. 
The same thing is happening 
with climate change — it’s seen as 
just another liberal issue, not an 
existential threat to people from all 
political backgrounds.

Climate change doesn’t even 

have 
someone 
like 
Fauci, 
a 

spokesman who has at least tried to 
remain apolitical. The world’s most 
prominent climate-change activists 
are known liberals. Ocasio-Cortez 
is a vilified progressive. Sir David 
Attenborough once quipped that 
the best way to deal with former 
President Donald Trump was to 
“shoot him.” Greta Thunberg, 

perhaps the best-known climate 
activist, has done well to avoid 
party 
politics. 
But 
even 
she 

endorsed Biden before the 2020 
presidential election. 

While those embracing the 

danger of climate change are so 
often liberal, it is important to 
acknowledge the growing number 
of conservatives acknowledging the 
problem. Climate change is stated 
as one of Utah Sen. Mitt Romney’s 
“greatest fears for the US.” U.S. 
Rep. John Curtis, also from 
Utah, started the Conservative 
Climate Caucus last June — with 
55 of his Republican colleagues. 
Even Republican voters, young 
moderates in particular, are open to 
some government action on climate 
issues. These are the type of people 
advocates of environmental action 
could bring in if they weren’t so 

I

n calendar year three of 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 

fatigue is reaching an all-

time high. As of Jan. 15, 2022, 
COVID-19 has claimed more than 
850,000 American lives. Every 
reasonable measure should be 
enacted to defeat this virus. That 
said, students cannot be expected 
to put aside our best interests in 
fear of COVID-19 spreading in low 
risk classroom environments. The 
calls to “e-pivot” in-person classes 
— though in good faith — are not 
in the best interest of the student 
body. 

The relative risk to University 

of Michigan students of serious 
complications as a result of COVID-
19 is low and even lower when 
compared to the devastating toll 
that remote learning has inflicted on 
students’ mental health. In-person 
classes are not the primary method 
of spreading COVID-19 throughout 
the U-M community, but they do 
continue to create meaningful 
connections 
between 
students 

and add irreplaceable academic 
experience. 
Some 
measures 

taken by the University, like the 
ResponsiBlue mobile app, function 
more like “hygiene theatre” than 
an actual method of verifying 
a 
person’s 
health. 
With 
the 

implementation of more regular 
testing, 
though, 
ResponsiBlue 

could become a much stronger 
weapon against COVID-19. The 
Winter 2022 semester should then 
continue in person as planned, with 
the added public health measure of 
mandatory weekly testing for all 
students taking classes in or living 
on campus. 

College students experienced 

a mental health crisis during the 
semesters of online learning last 
year. A study surveying college 
students during the 2020 school 
year found that 71% of respondents 
felt a higher level of stress and 
anxiety in response to COVID-19. 
Stressors included the physical 
health of the students and their 
loved ones, the loss of social 
interaction and lower academic 
performance. 
Most 
worrying, 

the study found that 8% of the 
student sample reported thoughts 
of suicide, compared with 3-7% 
in pre-pandemic studies. This 
disturbing trend is a grim reminder 
that protecting the mental health 
of students is just as important as 
protecting their physical health. 

Research has affirmed time and 

time again that overall, in-person 
learning is a superior form of 
education 
for 
undergraduate 

students. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 

aforementioned harmful effects 
on mental health, studies found 
that “students in online courses 
generally get lower grades, are less 
likely to perform well in follow-
on coursework, and are less likely 
to graduate than similar students 
taking in-person classes.” While 
remote learning may have been a 
necessary precaution in the pre-
vaccine era, it is not worth reviving 
the harms of remote learning at a 
school where 98% of students have 
received at least the first two doses 
of the vaccine and are required 
to receive a booster shot by next 
month.

Nevertheless, it is important to 

acknowledge the valid fears that 
students have about in-person 
learning in a time of massive 
spread of the disease. There 
are 
many 
reasons 
for 
these 

students to be concerned, be they 
immunocompromised 
or 
those 

worried about some of the long-
term effects of COVID-19 that we 
are only beginning to understand. 

Some professors, this semester, 

have provided the option of 
asynchronous 
participation 

by 
utilizing 
lecture 
capture 

software or uploading recorded 
lectures from a previous semester. 
Encouraging more professors to 
follow suit would allow the majority 
of students to enjoy in-person 
instruction 
without 
forcing 

concerned students to make the 
choice between education and their 
health. In cases where one course is 
in a recordable space while another 
is not, course coordinators should 
be allowed to upload recorded 
lectures onto a Canvas page 
accessible to all students taking that 
course. 

Discussion 
sections 
pose 
a 

unique 
problem 
for 
students 

and 
instructors 
due 
to 
the 

impracticality of having only a 
few students attending virtually. 
To 
avoid 
any 
complications 

associated with University-wide 
accommodations, 
Services 
for 

Students with Disabilities should 
facilitate 
agreements 
between 

immunocompromised 
students 

and their instructors that grant 
those students greater flexibility 
and/or necessary accommodations 
for 
safe 
participation. 
Similar 

flexibility should be given to 
students who are unable to attend 
class because of a positive COVID-
19 test, close contact notification or 
anxiety over the pandemic. 

The current testing framework 

only mandates that unvaccinated 
and 
exempt 
students 
procure 

a 
weekly 
negative 
test. 
To 

maintain in-person instruction, 
the University needs to update 
its testing protocol and make 
regular testing mandatory for the 

vaccinated student body as well. 
The Feb. 4 booster shot mandate 
will 
ensure 
that 
community 

members are better protected 
against COVID-19 and assuage 
fears about developing serious 
complications from contracting the 
virus.

However, 
as 
we 
know, 

asymptomatic spread can account 
for a large portion of community 
transmission. As such, mandatory, 
regular testing would be an effective 
method of preventing unknowingly 
infected individuals from infecting 
others. Increased opportunities 
for asymptomatic testing, through 
the pre-established Community 
Sampling and Tracking Program, 
will be especially crucial to the 
campus 
community 
as 
they 

gradually receive booster shots 
before the Feb. 4 deadline.

Previous testing requirements 

imposed during the Fall 2020 
and Winter 2021 semesters were 
the University’s first attempts at 
campus-wide testing. Although 
financially costly, increasing testing 
capacity 
gave 
administrators 

a clear picture of the level of 
transmission on campus and kept 
community members informed 
about their health. This semester, 
MHousing provided two at-home 
tests to all residents in student 
housing, but the effectiveness of 
that strategy depended on students 
honestly reporting positive test 
results. There has also been a rising 
demand for at-home tests around 
the world, partially fueled by the 
U.S. government, particularly in 
response to the Omicron variant.

A framework working towards 

mandatory weekly testing for 
everyone who comes on campus 
is 
essential 
for 
maintaining 

in-person 
instruction 
and 

limiting 
unnecessary 
COVID-

19 
transmission. 
Furthermore, 

while it would require increased 
staff and resources, University-
administered testing would likely 
be a more resolute solution given 
the unreliability of rapid tests and a 
question mark over the honor code 
that comes with self-reporting.
Although intentions behind an 
e-pivot are sound, its consequences 
could be dire for a student body that 
is showing visible signs of fatigue 
when it comes to online learning. 
Moreover, if the correct steps are 
taken and with the cooperation of 
the University and the community 
as a whole, the coming semester 
can still be the most “normal” 
one of recent times. In its third 
calendar year, it is more clear than 
ever before that defeating COVID-
19 will require everyone, from 
students to professors to U-M 
officials, to work toward a common 
goal.

Let’s not make the same mistake ‘Don’t Look Up’ does; stop politicizing our climate

Y

ik Yak, a social media 
app originally shut down 
in 2017, was rereleased 

last summer and has since built 
up a considerable presence at the 
University of Michigan. 

For those of you unfamiliar with 

Yik Yak, it allows all users to post 
anonymously. The catch? Only 
people within a five mile radius of 
you can comment on, upvote and 
downvote your posts. Upvotes and 
downvotes are similar to a like or 
dislike on other social media apps. 

The distance sensitive feature 

of the app creates a small bubble of 
users, and therefore a tight circle 
for gossip. The creators of the app, 
Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington, 
actually intended to create an outlet 
for college students to gossip about 
their peers when they first released 
Yik Yak in 2013. 

As 
you 
can 
imagine, 
the 

anonymity and close proximity of 
users created a breeding ground 
for cyberbullying and threatening 
messages. In 2014, some users from 
San Francisco posted Yik Yaks 
that made fun of students who had 
been raped. Also in 2014, one user 
posted a bomb threat, sending a 
high school in San Clemente, Calif. 
into lockdown and prompting 
involvement from law enforcement. 
There was even a student at the 
University of Missouri who was 
arrested for making violent posts 
directed at Black people. At the 
University of Mary Washington, 

a student named Grace Mann was 
murdered shortly after chilling 
posts were made about the feminist 
club she was a member of. A Yik 
Yak user made a post saying they 
were “gonna tie these feminists to 
the radiator and grape [sic] them in 
the mouth.”

A former Yik Yak employee 

recounts 
that 
a 
majority 
of 

the posts she moderated were 
harmless, but the terrible ones 
were rattling enough to take a toll 
on her mental health. The former 
employee said that at Yik Yak’s 
headquarters in Atlanta, employees 
were encouraged not to discuss the 
disturbing posts. The only action 
taken in these troubling incidents 
took the form of a few employees 
being pulled into a room to quickly 
debrief. As they would exit the 
room, they would act as if nothing 
occurred, encouraging the other 
employees to continue on with 
their work and “make the app run.” 

Yik Yak did in fact take efforts 

to rectify these problems by 
implementing georeferencing, a 
way of blocking access to the app 
in certain locations. This allowed 
them to block students from using 
the app at 85% of high schools in the 
United States.

Despite Yik Yak’s improvement 

efforts, the app quickly gained a 
controversial reputation. Interest 
began to decline, with 75% lower 
usage between 2015 and 2016. Its 
waning popularity ultimately led 
to it being taken off of app stores in 
2017.

However, on Aug. 16, 2021, the 

app was relaunched. The app is 

now marketed toward people 
ages seventeen and older. It also 
emphasizes anti-bullying from the 
moment you download the app. 
Offensive posts can be reported by 
other users and are automatically 
removed if they are downvoted 
enough times. When certain words 
or emojis are used, the post is 
automatically removed as well. 

Despite these safeguards, the 

content posted on Yik Yak continues 
to walk a fine line between crude 
humor and blatant insensitivity. 
Users of the app have figured out 
ways to work around the words 
and emojis that cause posts to be 
automatically 
removed. 
Rather 

than using the words “suicide” or 
“kill,” users post about “unaliving” 
themselves or someone else. 

Overall, the relaunched version 

of Yik Yak has not come close to the 
level of insensitivity that caused its 
original demise. While many of the 
posts have been raunchy or petty, 
there have not been any outstanding 
issues with violent targets aimed 
toward any specific individuals. 
There have undoubtedly been 
mean-spirited posts about certain 
groups, but not with intent to cause 
harm toward that group. If Yik 
Yak’s claim to being a strong anti-
bullying platform is true, at the first 
instance of violence or bullying, I 
expect they will launch into action 
to address that issue. 

While Yik Yak seems to be doing 

fine so far, the app as a concept 
is bound to be problematic. The 

Yik Yak is back, but where is it going?

A

s we enter the new 
year 
of 
2022, 
the 

common 
practice 

of New Year’s Resolutions 
may look a bit different. 
Undoubtedly, many will flock 
to the gym or cut carbs or 
begin writing their Great 
American Novel in an attempt 
to start the year off on what 
they believe to be “the right 
foot.” However, given the 
irrefutably 
overwhelming 

nature of the past few years, 
this year I believe the only 
goal should be to emphasize 
and prioritize self-care. In 
2022, find your therapy. 

Anyone 
who 
personally 

knows me knows how open 
I am about therapy. I’ve 
never understood the stigma 
surrounding 
something 

so 
natural, 
humane 
and 

immensely 
beneficial. 
I 

started talking to a therapist 
right before my sophomore 
year of college and it was one 
of the best decisions I’ve ever 
made. So many of my friends 
have also started their own 
therapeutic 
journeys 
and 

many have been on their’s 
for 
years. 
In 
the 
past, 

therapy was associated with 
uncontrollable mental illness. 
This could not be further 
from the truth. In reality, 
there is not one person alive 
today that would not benefit 
from essentially having an 
unbiased third party to talk 
to. 

I 
encourage 
you 
to 

redefine 
therapy. 
Instead 

of a comfortable couch and 
a glasses and sweater-clad 
psychologist 
scribbling 
on 

a notepad, envision a zoom 
meeting with two cups of 
coffee 
and 
a 
45-minute 

conversation. Put yourself in 
a position where instead of 
the outdated, stereotypical 
dialogue 
like 
“and 
how 

does that make you feel?” 
you are encouraged to view 
complicated situations with a 
healthier perspective and to 
re-establish boundaries with 
yourself and those around 
you. 

Having 
said 
that, 

therapy is also much more 
commonplace in today’s day 
and age. Recognizing that 
I am extremely fortunate 
to have parents that are 
capable of paying for my 
therapist that is not covered 
by insurance, it is extremely 
feasible to find a plethora 
of equally helpful resources 
for 
different 
monetary 

demographics. 
Online 

companies 
like 
BetterHelp 

or TalkSpace, among others, 
offer 
different 
payment 

plans and opportunities to 
get 
financial 
assistance. 

Beyond talk therapy, there 
are 
so 
many 
additional 

therapeutic 
practices 
that 

can even be completely free. 
As the pandemic uncertainty 
continues, 
it 
is 
also 

understandable to stray from 
an in-person therapy session. 
Thankfully, 
many, 
if 
not 

all, therapists have remote 
opportunities through virtual 
formats. 

Delving deeper, therapeutic 

practices come in all shapes 
and sizes. For me, self-care 
means much more than the 
conversations I engage in 
every once and a while with 
my therapist. Therapy can 
and 
should 
mean 
having 

an effective morning and 
nighttime routine, listening 
to music that boosts your 
serotonin 
and 
integrating 

activities into your life that 
exist for the sole purpose of 
making you feel good. 

If the pandemic has shown 

us anything, it is to appreciate 
the time we have. I mean this 
not in a morbid, “the clock is 
ticking” type way, but instead 
that we must do our best to 
honor the mere ability to 
sip cocktails with friends or 
read a book in a public café. 
Especially at the University of 
Michigan, I made it a priority 
to 
soak 
in 
every 
second 

spent in The Big House this 
year and intend on doing 
the same at every basketball 
game I attend. As the cliché 
saying goes: “We never truly 
appreciate something until 
it’s gone.”

The inability to enjoy the 

outside world throughout the 
rollercoaster ride of COVID-
19 has been a brutal reminder 
and an unpleasant wake-up 
call to take absolutely nothing 
for granted. Again, therapy 
does not need to mean this 
conventional yet antiquated 
conception of a couch and a 
legal pad. Therapy is whatever 
you require to check in with 
and ensure you are being kind 
to yourself. Influencers and 
apps alike have reinforced 
the importance of making 
goals for the New Year far 
less focused on loss or gain 
and instead on the wonderful 
amalgamation of good and 
bad right in front of you. 
Focus instead on the prospect 
of human possibility. 

Therapy may mean that you 

must cut some toxicity out of 
your life or make decisions 
that seem impossible. But it 
must be an essential part of 
everyone’s 
life, 
especially 

as we continue to navigate 
this 
turbulent, 
uncharted 

territory. I reject the concept 
that each year is a completely 
brand new opportunity to sink 
or swim. That is far too much 
pressure to put on any person. 
Instead, conceptualize 2022 
as a coloring book. Each day 
is a page, and while certain 
outlined 
images 
may 
be 

decided for you, you have the 
opportunity to choose from 
whatever array of colors is at 
your disposal and make each 
day a unique picture. To me, 
that starts with crushing the 
stigma and finding whatever 
therapy means to you.

10 — Wednesday, January 19, 2022 

A

fter the Dot-Com bubble 
burst in 2000, many 
individuals 
feared 

that the technology sector was 
primed to lose its global reach 
following an astounding period 
of mania. From the ashes of the 
crash, however, rose companies 
like Amazon, Google, Twitter 
and Facebook, far stronger than 
their predecessors and hell-
bent on achieving worldwide 
prominence. Unfortunately, in 
their rapid rise to power, these 
companies 
have 
generated 

an endless flow of criticism. 
Politicians across the aisle are 
irate over their monopolistic 
tendencies, 
inadequate 

protection of free speech and 
murky privacy policies. These 
concerns have led to several 
high-profile hearings and the 
introduction of legislation in 
Congress, all with the aim 
of 
significantly 
reducing 

Big Tech’s influence. While 
this combative 
approach 
is 

understandable, in order to 
maintain America’s competitive 
advantage 
in 
tech 
on 
an 

international scale, it’s critical 
that 
the 
government 
shifts 

its 
regulatory 
efforts 
from 

haphazard antitrust maneuvers 
to more constructive approaches 
that improve the overall health 
of the technology sector while 
allowing companies to preserve 
their core business models.

Though 
there 
are 
many 

proposed regulatory bills, the 
most dangerous to innovation 
is likely the bipartisan Platform 

Competition and Opportunity 
Act introduced by Sen. Amy 
Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Sen. 
Tom 
Cotton, 
R-Ark., 
which 

would 
fundamentally 
alter 

the process of mergers and 
acquisitions for American tech 
companies. Currently, regulators 
bear the burden of proving 
that 
deals 
violate 
antitrust 

laws. The new legislation seeks 
to shift the responsibility of 
demonstrating that transactions 
maintain market competition 
to 
companies 
instead. 
This 

radical change would drastically 
increase the amount of red tape 
in the deal-making process and 
require Big Tech firms to engage 
in significant legal action for 
any 
potential 
moves. 
Since 

acquisitions far outnumber IPOs 
in startup exits, this disastrous 
proposal would actually serve 
to stymie competition in the 
startup ecosystem by stifling 
deal flow. By limiting incentives 
for 
startups 
and 
investors, 

the 
legislation 
threatens 
to 

deal a death blow to American 
innovation. 
Most 
tech 

startups are unable to achieve 
profitability 
independently. 

With 
a 
low 
volume 
of 

acquisitions, many companies 
will be unable to take advantage 
of Big Tech’s resources while 
building 
products, 
and 
will 

instead 
face 
the 
threat 
of 

bankruptcy.

If Congress is serious about 

promoting competition with 
Big Tech, a more impactful 
area to focus on would be 
individual and corporate tax 
codes. Since labor is already 
incredibly expensive in the 

U.S. relative to other nations, 
American startups inherently 
face 
tremendous 
expenses 

that make scaling a company 
challenging. 
Reducing 

corporate tax rates for small 
businesses in the industry 
could 
have 
an 
immediate 

impact 
on 
increasing 

competition by helping the 
cost structure of early-stage 
companies. 
Studies 
have 

shown that a 1% increase in 
corporate tax is correlated 
with a 1.8% decrease in new 
startups and a 3.7% decrease 
in 
startup 
employees, 
so 

lowering corporate tax could 
help 
stimulate 
innovation. 

Furthermore, 
by 
reducing 

the long-term capital gains 
rate, more individuals could 
be incentivized to join and 
launch companies without the 
worry of being exorbitantly 
taxed on their stock options 
upon acquisitions and IPOs.

Beyond 
modifying 
their 

approach 
to 
improving 

competition, 
regulators 
also 

must tweak their plans to 
preserve 
free 
speech 
and 

maintain data privacy. Although 
the need to collect user data in 
advertisement-based platforms 
is less than ideal, it’s unrealistic 
to expect Facebook, Twitter, 
Google and other companies 
whose 
revenue 
stems 
from 

advertising 
to 
steer 
away 

from data collection. A more 
fruitful approach would be to 
collaborate with the tech sector 
on standardizing the sharing 
of data collection practices 
with users. By having specific 
regulations 
on 
informing 

users of how their data is 
being aggregated, individuals 
will be able to make more 
informed decisions about which 
platforms they feel comfortable 
using. 

In the realm of free speech, 

Congress would be best served 
by finding a balance between 
fully repealing Section 230 — the 
communications law permitting 
companies to moderate content 
on their platforms — and allowing 
censorship and misinformation 
to 
prevail. 
Regulators 
can 

explicitly 
prohibit 
extremist 

content 
from 
all 
platforms 

and place a ban on any direct 
political discrimination, while 
still leaving companies enough 
leeway to moderate and shape the 
culture of their own platforms.

Now more than ever, it’s 

important that America not 
upend the capabilities of its 
tech 
industry. 
With 
China 

intending to spend $1.4 trillion 
by 2025 to make its technology 
sector globally dominant in 
5G, 
artificial 
intelligence 

and quantum computing, we 
can’t afford to weaken our 
own ability to compete. Big 
Tech is certainly not perfect, 
but with global penetration, 
Chinese technology companies 
have the potential to carry out 
widespread surveillance and 
data mining under the orders of 
a government with a death grip 
on the private sector. If we hope 
to stand up to China and other 
countries that threaten our 
technological prowess in the 
future, Congress must resist the 
temptation to blow up Big Tech 
and instead move towards less 

It’s time to rethink how we regulate Big Tech

Hughes’s speed 

devastates 
Penn State

Michigan blows past Ohio State, 29-8, in first Big Ten dual of the season

With nine seconds left in the 

second quarter, a fast break for 
Maryland had begun to form. 
Terrapins forward Angel Reese 
looked to get a last second layup 
before the end of the half to trim 
the deficit. But Michigan senior 
forward Naz Hillmon was back 
defensively and made an emphat-
ic left-handed block inside the 
paint to deny Reese’s shot and 
keep Maryland from scoring.

The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 

found a rhythm early in its vic-
tory against the Terrapins, spur-
ring a 69-49 victory. As such, 
they forced Maryland into tak-
ing difficult shots and were able 
to force turnovers.

“I thought our lock in and 

focus on the defensive end was 
absolutely incredible,” Michi-
gan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
said. 

The Terrapins started the 

game scoring 11 points, shooting 
5-of-7 in the first four minutes of 
the game. It certainly wasn’t the 
defensive start that Michigan 
was looking for. 

The Wolverines made adjust-

ments early in the game, as they 
put more of a focus towards 
defending the paint. This proved 
successful as after starting 5-of-
7 from the field, Maryland fin-
ished the remainder of the game 
shooting just 11-of-44. 

Michigan put an emphasis on 

defending the paint, making the 
Terrapins take a number of out-
side shots. Maryland was also 
silenced on the offensive glass, 
held to zero offensive rebounds 
in the first quarter and unable 
to muster second chance points. 

The Terrapins offense is predicated around 

getting rebounds off the glass, as they lead the 
Big Ten with 15.8 offensive boards per game. 
Reese leads the nation in offensive rebounds 
with 5.4 boards per game, so stopping her was 
critical to the Wolverines success. 

Michigan was able to achieve this as 

they held her to one offensive rebound 
in the first half, which came in the final 
seconds of the second quarter. That was 
a concerted effort.

“Are we going to be able to rebound 

the basketball with them because they’ll 
miss shots, but sometimes they’ll just go 
get their offensive rebound and be able 
to put it back in there,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Obviously (Maryland’s) one of the best 
offensive rebounding teams in the coun-
try as well. So I thought we really did an 
amazing job on defense and then finish-
ing the play by rebounding.”

The Wolverines made a statement on 

defense in the second quarter, too, hold-
ing the Terrapins to one field goal in the 
entire quarter on 1-of-9 shooting. 

“I just thought we were unbelievable,” 

Barnes Arico said. “I thought we set the 
tone. I thought we scrambled for each 
other. I thought we rebounded. I think 
our experience and lock in was just tre-
mendous.” 

Their strong defense was a result of 

the ability to force turnovers and put 
pressure on Maryland’s best offensive 
player. Reese, coming into the game 
averaged 18.2 points per game, had zero 
points in the first half. She shot 0-of-5 
and had three turnovers in the first, and 
ended the game with nine. 

Michigan was also able to stop Ter-

rapins guard Ashley Owusu. 
Owusu came into this game 
averaging 16.4 points per game, 
but was held to four points on 
40% 
shooting. 
Wolverines’ 

senior guard Maddie Nolan was 
the primary defender against 
Owusu.

“I think Maddie did a great job 

setting the tone on Ashlee early 

on,” Barnes Arico said. “I think 
our kids really bought into under-
standing the personnel, under-
standing their tendencies, and 
then scrambling for each other, 
something that we’ve worked on 
a lot.” 

Nolan’s strong defensive per-

formance forced three turnovers 
on Owusu. Coming into this game, 
the Terrapins averaged 11.4 turn-
overs per game, the fourth fewest 
in Division 1 women’s basketball. 
They had thirteen turnovers in the 
first half alone. 

The turnovers and strong first 

half defense allowed Michigan to 
go up 34-19.

In the second half, Maryland 

continued to struggle shooting 
the ball, as they shot 2-of-16 in the 
third. The Wolverines nullified 
the Terrapins offensive rebound-
ing as they defended the inside 
of the paint, forcing them to take 
outside shots. As a result of the 
outside shots, they were held 
scoreless for periods of 3:38 and 
2:43 in the third quarter. 

The most memorable moment 

in the third quarter came when 
the Wolverines had four players 
defending slightly outside the 
paint to stop a turnaround layup.

Michigan’s physicality on 

the play did not allow Mary-
land to drive inside the paint 
forcing them to take outside 
shots. When the Terrapins 
grabbed an offensive rebound, 
they shot a driving layup inside 
the paint. But the shot wasn’t 
close, and Kiser snatched the 
rebound. 

That sequence summed up 

Michigan’s dominating defen-
sive performance.

Bill Muckalt has a saying 

when Luke Hughes blows by 
his man:

“Bye bye.”
And on Saturday against 

Penn State, Michigan’s asso-
ciate head coach probably 
sounded like a broken record. 
Hughes used his speed to skate 
all over the Nittany Lions on 
both ends of the ice. In a game 
that saw No. 4 Michigan rally 
from a two-goal deficit, in 
many cases, Hughes’s speed 
led the Wolverines toward 
victory.

“It’s great to see him tak-

ing steps every day,” sopho-
more goaltender Erik Portillo 
said. “The last two games here 
(Hughes is) really taking a 
step and helping the team 
win.”

Fast skating isn’t unusual 

for Hughes’s game, but he 
combined it with the rest 
of his game to devastating 
effect against Penn State. His 
positioning never let the Nit-
tany Lions set up on his inside 
shoulder, blocking their path 
toward center ice and creating 
races for the puck — races that 
favor Hughes.

And that same speed played 

a crucial role in the Wolver-
ines’ breakouts, combining 
his stick skills and elusiveness 
to dodge forecheckers. His 
skates never stopped moving, 
making micro adjustments to 
mirror the direction of the 
puck. Then when Penn State 
made a mistake, those same 
skates took off in an instant.

With that success exiting 

the zone, Michigan relied 
on Hughes to command its 
transition 
game. 
Handling 

the puck with his top hand, 
Hughes spun around fore-
checkers with ease as they 
tried to pry the puck off his 
stick. Like a miniature game 

of keep away, Hughes spun left 
and right as they scrambled for 
the puck — always a step ahead.

“You can rely on him to get 

pucks out and make a skilled 
play,” senior forward Nolan 
Moyle said. “It’s really nice 
having him back there.”

But Hughes had to get the 

puck on his stick to make 
those plays, and the Nittany 
Lions’ physical forecheck made 
that an uphill battle. Hughes 
embraced the contact, using 
his speed to build momentum 
before unleashing it along the 
boards. 

That willingness to grind 

along the boards proved vital to 
Michigan’s success, especially 
as it found itself killing penal-
ties often. Normally a defense-
man can get trapped in those 
battles, leading to dangerous 
chances for the other team. 
Hughes’s speed made certain 
they would be few and far 
between.

But for all his defensive suc-

cess, Hughes made that speed 
matter on offense, relying on 
his quickness to dodge around 
backcheckers. And paired once 
again with sophomore defen-
seman Jacob Truscott, Hughes 
saw ample opportunities to 
lean on it.

With Michigan within a 

goal, Hughes found his chance 
to capitalize. Coming off the 
rush, Hughes wiggled behind 
Penn State’s defense and scored 
before the Nittany Lions could 
react. Hughes skated so hard he 
didn’t have time to stop before 
crashing into the boards.

“It’s almost like having anoth-

er forward on the ice back there,” 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
said, “He really uses his skating 
to his advantage, to create scor-
ing opportunities not only for 
himself but his teammates.”

And those scoring oppor-

tunities have come all season. 
Hughes’s 22 points are the most 
of all freshmen defensemen, 
and they’re not just coming off 

secondary 
assists 

and goals through 
traffic. His elusive 
speed has created 

some of the Wol-

verines’ 
best 

goals.

Having 

quick 
feet 

gives Hughes a 
weapon 
against 

physical 
teams, 

but it doesn’t matter 
if he can’t combine 
it with the rest of 
his game. Hughes 
proved he’s got the 
second step figured 

out.

COLUMBUS —When Michigan 

and Ohio State wrestle, it’s almost 
always a tight affair. 

Last year’s dual between the two 

teams was decided by a dramatic 
overtime takedown that gave the 
Wolverines a narrow one-point vic-
tory. Three years ago it was then-
freshman 
heavyweight 
Mason 

Parris whose high-stakes decision 
victory propelled his team’s come-
from-behind two-point win. Friday 
night’s dual was different. 

It also ended with fireworks 

from Parris in the form of a first 
period pin. But this time, less than 
half of the once raucous Buckeyes’ 
crowd had stuck around to watch it, 
and the final score was 29-8. 

No. 3 Michigan (5-0 overall, 1-0 

Big Ten) didn’t just beat No. 7 Ohio 
State (5-1, 1-1), it dominated them 
to the tune of a 21 point difference, 
winning eight of ten bouts with 
three victories earning the team 
bonus points. 

Ohio State was billed as the Wol-

verines’ first real test of the season, 
and it’s one they passed with flying 
colors. There was never a moment 

in the night where the Buckeyes 
looked as if they were even threat-
ening to hand Michigan its first loss. 

The night’s action started at 125 

lbs., where No. 1 ranked former 
NCAA champion Nick Suriano 
earned an 11-3 major-decision vic-
tory over No. 18 Malik Heinselman 
that put the Wolverines up 4-0. 
The graduate student wrestled at a 
furious pace the entire bout, and it 
paid off. He scored takedown after 
takedown on his opponent. And as 
Heinselman tired late in the bout, 
he surrendered a stalling point that 
put Suriano up by eight, and secured 
bonus points.

“We started off with a lot of 

momentum coming off at 125 with 
Nick Suriano,” graduate student 
Myles Amine said. “His energy, his 
intensity, was inspiring and set the 
tone for the rest of the match.”

At 133 lbs., redshirt freshman 

Dylan Ragusin bounced back from 
his loss at Arizona State with a 
strong showing in his match with 
Ohio 
State’s 
Will 
Betancourt. 

Ragusin sacrificed the usual low-
erweight agility antics to wrestle 
a controlled, pensive style. This 
worked for Ragusin as he won 14-5, 
earning a major-decision victory 
and putting Michigan up 8-0.

Graduate student Stevan Micic 

also bounced back from a loss, 
this time able to finish his leg 
attacks to earn a 11-7 victory over 
No. 21 Dylan D’Emilio at 141 lbs., 
making the score 11-0 Wolver-
ines. 

But two Michigan losses sand-

wiching a Will Lewan victory left 
the score 14-8, putting Ohio State a 
pin away from tying the dual when 
174 lb. graduate student Logan 
Massa took the mat.

In his second dual match of the 

season, No. 6 Massa faced No. 7 
Ethan Smith in what was expect-
ed to be the biggest tossup of the 
night. Two periods in, Massa was 
down 4-2, but a dominant third 
period in which Massa tripped, 
took down and tilted Smith led 
him to a 10-4 decision victory. As 
Massa’s hand was raised, boos 
rained down from the Buckeyes’ 
crowd, which Massa clearly rev-
eled in, skipping around the mat 

with his arms raised before run-
ning to the locker room. 

Any energy Ohio State had built 

evaporated and the score was 17-8.

“He overwhelmed the guy in 

the third period,” Michigan coach 
Sean Bormet said. “…You could see 
it in his eyes he was determined, he 
stayed consistent and was persistent 
about getting to the leg attacks. Psy-
chologically it was very demoraliz-
ing for the opponent and the rest of 
that lineup. They felt like they were 
getting a little momentum after 
165.”

If Massa’s victory demoralized 

the Buckeyes, 184 lb. Amine’s over-
time win crushed them. 

The 
second-ranked 
Amine 

wrestled an incredibly tight, low 
scoring match against No. 7 ranked 
Kaleb Romero. Amine and Romero 
found themselves in scramble after 
scramble in which each fended off 
numerous takedowns. In overtime, 
the intensity was turned to a new 
level, as each wrestler rolled or spun 
through what looked to be certain 
takedowns to keep the match alive. 
A minute and a half into the sud-
den victory period, Amine initiated 
a third scramble, narrowly avoided 
Romero’s counter, and slipped 
through his legs to earn the win-

ning takedown. Romero pounded 
the mat in frustration and fans 
streamed to exits, at 20-8, the result 
was decided. 

“Coming into this match tonight 

I knew Myles wasn’t at his best,” 
Bormet said. “But he is just a fear-
less competitor. I know he wanted 
to have a more dominant victory, but 
there’s something to be said about 
being able to win that kind of match 
when you need to in this kind of 
environment, and finding a way 
to get your hand raised. And there 
aren’t many out there that can do it 
better than Myles Amine.”

197 lb. graduate student Pat 

Brucki’s 5-2 win over Gavin Hoff-
man and Mason Parris’s pin added 
an exclamation point to the night 
for the Wolverines. But unlike 
previous years, their heroics were 
unnecessary.

As the Wolverines look forward 

to next Friday’s dual against No. 
1 Penn. State they’ll need another 
dominant performance. Friday’s 
victory is a strong place to build 
from. 

As Parris recognized: 
“We’re hoping to build on this 

win, build on this confidence and 
keep going the rest of the year.”

 Michigan needs to find offense beyond its top 

line, and for that, it should look to its veterans.

MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily 

Michigan’s stellar defense shut down Maryland’s attack from the first 

quarter, fueling the victory.

Fight hard.
That was the Michigan men’s 

tennis team’s mentality after 
dropping a sloppy doubles per-
formance to open its first match 
of the season Sunday against Vir-
ginia Tech.

And the Wolverines rebounded 

in spectacular fashion.

Michigan (1-0 overall) rallied 

to win five of six singles matches 
against the Hokies (0-2) to notch 
its first win of the season, 5-2.

“They just fought their tails 

off,” Michigan coach Adam Stein-
berg said. “That was the biggest 
thing. … They didn’t want to let 
their teammates down.”

Doubles was unusually tough 

for the Wolverines, who did not 
lose the doubles point in their 
final eight meets last season. The 
No. 1 team struggled and was 
trounced by the Hokies; The No. 

2 team won a competitive match, 
but then the No. 3 team was out-
lasted in a tough fight in which 
neither 
side 
could 
maintain 

momentum between games.

Doubles put Michigan in 

an early hole, but things 
would change in singles. The 
Wolverines 
displayed 
grit 

throughout the rest of the 
day, 
never 
staying 
down, 

never losing focus.

They were motivated.
“I played in doubles, I didn’t 

play particularly great,” sopho-
more Jacob Bickersteth said. “I 
wanted to do better for my team. 
It was my first career doubles 
match.” 

Bickersteth certainly man-

aged to accomplish that by total-
ly dominating his singles outing. 

Bickersteth was the first 

singles winner of the day. 
After taking the first five 
games, he won the No. 3 match 
in two sets and only lost three 
games overall. This fast finish 

gave Michigan a much-needed 
morale boost. 

On the heels of Bickersteth’s 

win, sophomore Nino Ehren-
schneider in the No. 6 match 
and senior Patrick Maloney in 
the No. 4 match put up strong 
performances. As the matches 
progressed 
the 
Wolverines’ 

sideline energy only grew in 
intensity, and this energy would 
fuel a strong comeback from 
sophomore Gavin Young.

“Our energy was obviously way 

better than (Virginia Tech’s),” Bick-
ersteth said. “I feel like that got 
Gavin over the hump.”


Young turned it around. He won the 
second and third sets comfortably 
to earn Michigan its fourth point to 
clinch the win. 

Even after securing the win, 

the Wolverines’ fighting spirit 
continued via junior Ondrej Sty-
ler. 

The final matchup to finish 

was Styler’s battle with Hokie 
Carlo Donato. After winning the 
first set, Styler was unable to hold 
Donato down in the second, lead-
ing to a tie breaker. In the third 
set, Styler seemed to regain the 
upper hand, but then he slipped 
and injured his leg. 

He got back up and contin-

ued playing, but soon after the 
Michigan trainer forced him to 
take an injury timeout. And yet 
he persevered, re-entering and 
playing out the rest of his match, 
winning 6-4.

“It’s always nice to come back 

in singles, it’s a big confidence 
booster,” Steinberg said. “It was 
a really good match, it was tight. 
… It’s hard to win four singles 
against anybody.”

While the Wolverines did 

dominate the scoreboard, Vir-
ginia Tech gave Michigan a 
tough challenge throughout the 
afternoon — a challenge they 
respond to with grit and spirit.

Unlike previous matchups, Michigan dominated Ohio State in Columbus.


A

s senior wing Leigha 
Brown dribbled down the 
floor after a block from 

senior forward Naz Hillmon on 
the other end, Brown looked 
up. Seeing junior guard Maddie 
Nolan ahead of her post up on the 
3-point line, Brown fired a pass 
to Nolan. Taking the pass and 
squaring up the basket, Nolan 
unleashed her first 3-pointer of 
the game — of which seven more 
would follow.

The No. 11 Michigan women’s 

basketball team faced off with 
No. 8 Maryland Sunday in 
College Park. Led by a game-
high 21 points from Nolan, 
the Wolverines unleashed a 
beatdown, winning 69-49. The 
win snapped the Terrapins’ 
31-game home winning streak 
and marked the first win in 
program history at College Park.

Early full-court defensive 

pressure from the Terrapins 
couldn’t stop the Wolverines 
from scoring. Michigan came out 
white hot in the first quarter, 
entering the first media timeout 
having gone 6-for-6 from the 
floor. The Wolverines looked 
unfazed against the aggressive 
pressure. 

Carrying the team from the 

outset, Nolan stayed hot from 
behind the 3-point line for the 
entire night. In the first quarter 
alone, she went 3-for-3, setting 
an immediate tone.

More of the squad also 

contributed from three, with 
Brown and freshman guard Laila 
Phelia nailing early 3-pointers. 
The Wolverines ended the first 
shooting 71.4% from three.

“Tonight I feel like we did a lot 

better (of a) job of capitalizing 
on and just being able to put up 
shots at the right times,” Brown 
said.

With the Terrapins 

concentrating their defense 
in the paint against Hillmon, 
Michigan adjusted, bringing 
their offense to the perimeter. 
Ending the first quarter with 26 
points, the Wolverines outscored 
Maryland by 10.

“Teams are going to start 

double and triple teaming Naz 
(Hillmon),” Nolan said. “And 
if we can have people that can 
consistently knock down outside 
shots that’s going to be a game-
changer for us.”

Against Maryland, it was. 
On the opposite end, 

Michigan’s defense hedged 
hard on ball screens, forcing 
the Terrapins into multiple 
turnovers and holding them 
scoreless for the last two 
minutes of the first quarter. That 
narrative continued down the 
stretch.

Despite the slow start, 

Maryland tried to chip away in 
the second quarter. Speeding 
up the game, the Terrapins 
attempted to convert its 
defensive possessions into 
quick offensive buckets. But 
the Wolverines had all the 
momentum. Michigan held onto 
its lead, controlling the ball and 
not allowing the full-court press 
to disrupt their composure.

Dominant 3-point shooting 

persisted throughout the second 
quarter, with Nolan leading the 
charge. She opened the quarter 
with another 3-pointer from the 
wing, doubling the Wolverines’ 
lead. Senior guard Danielle 
Rauch also nailed a 3-pointer. 
Going into the locker room, 
Michigan held a comfortable 
15 point halftime lead, one that 
would only grow. 

The second half largely 

mirrored the first. Nolan 
continued to dominate from 
behind the 3-point line, making 
back-to-back 3-pointers in the 
third quarter and another in the 
fourth. Brown’s driving jumpers 
in the lane continued to stump 
Maryland’s defense. Bringing 
another layer of offensive 
prowess, Phelia and Hillmon 
also found their groove in the 
fourth quarter, scoring 11 and 
nine points, respectively.

Combined, Nolan and Brown 

notched 36 points, outscoring 
the Terrapins themselves for 
the majority of the game. 

“Our guards stepped up 
and just made play after 

play,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “Leigha 
Brown is arguably one of the 
best if not the best guards in 
the country, I believe. And 
Maddie Nolan is one of the 
best 3-point shooters and 
I’m happy that the whole 
world got a chance to see 
that tonight.”
