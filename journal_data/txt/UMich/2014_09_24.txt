Members of the Muslim Student Association pray during FestiFaith on the Diag Tuesday.

students of faith gather for
interconimunal celebration

Festifaith coalition
plans to hold panel
in the future
By CHARLOTTE JENKINS
Daily Staff Reporter
Students from eight different
religious organizations
gathered on the Diag Tuesday
for Festifaith: An Interfaith
Celebration.
Festifaith was the largest
interfaith event hosted . on

campus in recent years. The
student leaders who coordinated
the event said they also plan
to host an interfaith panel
about faith in the context of
relationships, and potentially
partner with the School of Social
Work.
The event featured students
from each of the eight
organizations, and opened with
a speech by University President
Mark Schlissel, who said he
wanted to show support for the
students and discussed how the
United States was formed on the

basis of religious freedom.
"It's a wonderful thing that
people are free to come to the
center of the University and
express their faith and share it
with one another," he said in an
interview. *
The event featured posters
where attendees could write
answers to questions including
"what could interfaith
programming look like on
campus," and "how do people
with diverse faiths on campus
interact?"
Students responded with

phrases including "collaborating
and celebrating," "connecting
through passions" and "seeking
common ground."
Kelly Dunlop, campus
minister at St. Mary Student
Parish, the primary Catholic
Church serving campus, said she
wanted the event to show how
many people of faith there are at
the University, and that this fact
should be celebrated. Dunlop
added that faith does not receive
the same amount of attention as
other identities on campus.

Snyder, Schauer to
meet for town hall
forum in Detroit
on Oct. 12
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily Staff Reporter
After some uncertainty, the
candidates in this year's guber-
natorial election - incumbent
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and
his Democratic challenger Mark
Schauer - will meet at least once
to debate before the Nov. 4 elec-
tion.
The debate, which will be held
in a town hall format at 6 p.m.
Oct. 12, was announced Monday
evening. Hosted by the Detroit
Free Press, the Detroit News and
Detroit Public Television, it will
be broadcasted live on Detroit
Public TV.
Questions will come from an
audience of undecided voters
pre-selected by polling compa-
nies employed by the two news-

papers and from co-moderators
Stephen Henderson, Detroit Free
Press editorial page editor, and
Nolan Finley, Detroit News edi-
torial page editor. The event will
be hosted by Christy McDonald,
DetroitPublic TV anchor.
In a statement Monday eve-
ning, Dianne Byrum, debate
negotiator for the Schauer cam-
paign, said the campaign was
excited for voters to have the
opportunity to see Schauer and
Snyder side-by-side.
"Mark will share his vision of
a building an economy that works
for everyone, not just those at
the top, and the governor should
be prepared to defend his record
over the past four years," Byrum
said.
It was previously unclear
whether there would be any
debates at all in the gubernatorial
election. A proposed first debate
between the two to be hosted by
WOOD-TV was canceled earlier
this month after only Schauer,
whose campaign has called for a
series of live, televised debates,

Leaders postpone
vote on stand with
Ferguson resolution
By ALYSSA BRANDON
DailyStaffReporter
The Central Student Govern-
ment met Tuesday night to dis-
cuss a resolution to stand with
protesters in Ferguson, Missouri
against alleged police brutality,
passed a resolution to improve
CSG oversight of student rights
and responsibilities and passed a
resolutiontogive morefundingto
the Student Organization Fund-
ing Commission.
Resolutionto standwith
Ferguson
Following the introduction of
a resolution that would express
CSG's solidarity with the people
of Ferguson last week, CSG con-
tinued discussion on the item but
ultimately postponed a vote.
The resolution would pledge
CSG's support for Ferguson
residents and decry what many
perceived as police brutality in
response to protests in the wake
of the death of local teenager
Michael Brown. Brown, who was
Black and unarmed at the time
of -the shooting, was shot and
killed by Darren Wilson, a white
Ferguson police officer on Aug.
9. Ferguson residents and people
around the nation have protested
what they see as racist and violent
practices of police officers in the
wake of the incident.

Tuesday night, members of
The CoalitiontoDefend Affirma-
tive Action attended the assembly
and spoke about why the resolu-
tion needs to be passed.
"When Black and Latino
youths being murdered by police
becomes a commonality, some-
thing accepted, something gone
unchallenged, a call to action
becomes necessary," BAMN
organizer Jose Alvarenga said.
Alvarenga said he believes
that the response from Ferguson
residents following the death
of Michael Brown is incredibly
inspiring and is something that
needs to be replicated every-
where, especially on college cam-
puses.
"Tonight the student govern-
ment has the opportunity to
stand behind Ferguson in their
struggle and join the national
movement against police brutal-
ity and ultimately make the lives
of Black and Latino youths safer,"
he said.
However, the assembly post-
poned the vote on the resolution
because the authors of the resolu-
tion were not present during the
meeting, as is necessary.
CSG members said they are
hopeful that they will be able to
be able to vote on the resolution
during next week's meeting.

Last member of the

defends group's

By EMMA KERR
Daily StaffReporter
University alum Howard Wil-
lens is the onlylivingsupervisor of
the commission that investigated
United States President John F.
Kennedy's assassination. In his
book History Will Prove Us Right,
he asserts that there is no evi-
dence supporting any conspiracy
theories that call into question the
presidentially-mandated commis-
sion's findings.
Willens addressed theories
Tuesday night ranging from the
missing bullet to the many pho-
tos not released to the public from
that day in a talk at the Gerald R.
Ford Presidential Library. Despite
nationwide criticism of the War-
ren Commission -named after
Chief Justice Earl Warren - Wil-
lens defended that the origi-

through a perspective he can offer
from his own first-hand experi-
ences.
"It was an extraordinary
assignment, and I worked with an
incredible group of people, but in
my experience, eventually you sort
of move on,"Willens said.
Launched by President Lyndon
B. Johnson on Nov. 29, 1963, the

Speaker emphasizes
value of women's
economic agenda
BySTEPHANIEDILWORTH
Daily StaffReporter
Droves of women - and a few
men - went to the Rackham
Graduate School Amphitheater
Tuesday to hear why the nation
needs a women's economic
agenda.
Nancy Duff Campbell, co-
president of the National Wom-
en's Law Center, spoke to these
students, faculty and visitors as
part of the Visiting Social Activ-
ist program sponsored by the
University's Center for Educa-

tionof Women. The presentation
was followed by a Q&A and a
reception at Rackham.
Throughout her lecture,
Campbell focused on the ways
that gender stereotypes, unrea-
sonable and unpredictable hours
in low wage jobs and inadequate
government and employer
response support for pregnant
workers negatively affect wom-
en's ability to succeed in the
workplace.
Campbell drew much of her
lecture on researchuand statistics
gathered by both the National
Women's Law Center and gov-
ernment agencies such as the
Census Bureau.
"Giving women the chance
to have their voices heard in
American workplaces is key to

their economic security and the
economic security of American
families," Campbell said. "And
ensuring this economic security
is why we need a women's eco-
nomic agenda."
Campbell also emphasized
the correlation between poverty
and gender. According to her
research, 59 percent of poor chil-
dren live in families headed by
women. She also said more than
three-quarters of workers in the
10 largest low-wage occupations
are women and over one-third
are women of color.
Some employees refuse to
provide accommodation for
pregnancy-related needs such as
requesting a chair when working
as a cashier but are willing to

United States, other
Western powers
pledge to halt
deforestation by 2030
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
In the first international test
for his climate-change strat-
egy, President Barack Obama
pressed world leaders Tuesday
to follow the United States' lead
on the issue, even as a United
Nations summit revealed the
many obstacles that still stand in
the way of wider agreements to
reduce heat-trapping pollution.
"The United States has made
ambitious investments in clean
energy and ambitious reductions
in our carbon emissions," Obama
said. "Today I call on all coun-
tries to join us, not next year or
the year after that, but right now.
Because no nation can meet this
global threat alone."
But none of the pledges made
at Tuesday's one-day meeting
was binding. The largest-ever
gathering of world leaders to
discuss climate was designed
to lay the groundwork for a new
global climate-change treaty. It
also revealed the sharp differ-
ences that divide countries on
matters such as deforestation,
carbon pollution and methane

leaks from oil and gas produc-
tion:
- Brazil, home to the Ama-
zon rainforest, said it would not
sign a pledge to halt deforesta-
tion by 2030.
- The United States decid-
ed not to join 73 countries in
supporting a price on carbon,
which Congress has indicated
it would reject.
- And minutes after Obama
said "nobody gets a pass," Chi-
nese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli
insisted the world treat develop-
ing nations, including China, dif-
ferently than developed nations,
allowing them to release more
heat-trapping pollution. China,
the No. - 1 carbon-polluting
nation, signed on in support of
pricing carbon and vowedto stop
the rise of carbon-dioxide emis-
sions as soon as possible.
"Today we must set the
world on a new course," said
United Nations Secretary-Gen-
eral Ban Ki-Moon, who added
that pricingcarbon was critical.
"Climate change is the defining
issue of our age. It is defining
our present. Our response will
define our future."
In some ways, the sum-
mit, which was part of the
annual U.N. General Assembly,
answered that call.
The European Union said its
member nations next month

were set to approve a plan that
would cut greenhouse gases
back to 40 percent below 1990
levels by 2030. The EU also
called for using renewable
energy for 27 percent of the
bloc's power needs and increas-
ing energy efficiency by 30 per-
cent.
The United States will not
release its new emissions tar-
gets until early next year.
"There were not that many
surprises," said Connie Hede-
gaard, the top climate official
for the European Commission,
referringto Obama's speech.
Hedegaard said the first-ever
limits on carbon from power
plants, proposed by Obama
back in June, were "a good
signal to send, but after today
we will still have to wait until
first quarter of 2015 to see how
ambitious the United States
will be."
By 2020, China will reduce
its emissions per gross domes-
tic product by 45 percent from
2005 levels, Zhang said. But
because economic growth in
China has more than tripled
since 2005, that means Chinese
carbon pollution can continue
to soar. Still, outside environ-
mentalists hailed the country's
promises because they went
beyond any of China's previous
statements.

replied to the invitation. Schauer
and Snyder have also been unable
to find a common time to appear
at the Detroit Economic Club, a
popular forum for gubernatorial
candidates. Both accepted invi-
tations to speak at the club at the
same day, but at different times.
"The ball is in Congressman
Schauer's court," wrote Emily
Benavides, Snyder campaign
communications director, in a
statement earlier this month in
regards to the DEC event. "We
look forward to discussing the
issues facing Michiganders and

assembly discussed a resolution
Tuesday to propose amend-
ments to some of the language
written within the Statement
of Student Rights and Respon-

Passing the resolution would

announced debate, the Snyder,
campaign announced last week
a series of town halls to be held
with the governor and undecid-
ed voters all around Michigan,
starting next week in Kalama-
zoo.
In a press release, Snyder
said the town halls were a way
to communicate with voters
about Michigan's progress over
the past four years and listen to
their needs, according to CBS
Detroit. In campaign ads and
separate public appearances thus
far, the main point of contention
between the two campaigns has'
been that progress and whether'
the state and its economy is on
the "road to recovery," as Snyder
has repeatedly said it is.
Schauer has criticized Snyder
over aspects of his record includ-

ing cuts to education funding,
reductions to tax exemptions on
retirement income and changes
to property tax credits, all of
which he has said aren't produc-
tive towards building the econ-
omy. Snyder has touted a streak
of balanced state budgets dur-
ing his tenure, a lowered unem-
ployment rate and varied efforts
towards job creation as proof of
positive impact.
These are all issues that have
figured prominently into the
campaigns thus far and could
come up in the town hall debate.
The Schauer campaign has
also accepted several more invi-
tations to debate from groups
including WXYZ, CBS Detroit
and Michigan Public Television.
Thus far, October's debate is the
only one scheduled.


CSG President Bobby Dishell,
a Public Policy senior, explained
the benefits of passing the reso-
lution to the assembly.
"Passing this resolution will
solidify the policies more for the
public and demonstrate that the
student body supports measures
against sexual misconduct," he
said.
CSG leadership plans to pre-
pare a press release to inform the
student body of the Task Force's
recommendation to improve
sexual misconduct procedures.

butions for this semester. The
amended budget distributions
would call for allocating 50 per-
cent of the annual budget to the

Student Organization Funding
Commission.
"SOFC is responsible for dis-
tributing funds to various groups
and organizations on campus
as they need like for events and
other things throughout the
school year," said CSG Treasurer
Alex Abdun-nabi, an LSA senior.
"All in all, passing the resolu-
tion would ensure that student
organizations have the funds
they need to be successful,"
In the end, after the first
unanimous decision of the year,
the resolution was passed.
"We believe that funding
SOFC allows the vibrancy
of student orgs to remain
and grow and flourish on
campus," Abdun-nabi said. "By
committing significant levels
of funding to SOFC, we are able
to increase the quality of every
Michigan's students experience
on campus."

University President Mark Schlissel addresses students at Festifaith on the Diag Tuesday.

FESTIFAITH
From Page 1A
"Our feeling was that while
social identity is a conversation
that is very active on campus
around gender and sexual
orientation and race and
ethnicity, faith matters and
religious identity were not open
to conversation," she said.
LSA junior Meagan Shokar,
public relations chair of the
Sikh Students Association,
said she thinks that interfaith
collaboration is necessary on
college campuses around the
country.
LSA sophomore Talha Ghazi,

interfaith coordinator for the
Muslim Student Association, said
that the experience of working
on Festifaith was an interfaith
experience in itself.
"Forget tension, it really
bonded us together," he said.
School ofInformation graduate
student Sidharth, who said he
could not provide his last name
for religious purposes, said his
goal for the event was to remind
students about the positive
aspects of faith.
"Faith is something that is put
off, but it is still deep in the hearts
of students,"
Sidharth said. "We want
people to bring the faith back into
their lives, so they can be more
peaceful and happy."

Student speakers echoed this
sentiment. Nursing senior Jill
Grabowski, a member of the
Catholic Student Association,
spoke about how the church made
her feel peaceful and athome.
"Give faith a shot if you're
struggling on campus," Grabowki
said, "Choose joy."
LSA junior Lukonde Mulenga,
outreach, campus and service
coordinator for the Wesley
Foundation, a United Methodist
organization, said she felt lost on
campus as a freshman from out-
of-state before joining Wesley.
"Wesley is a backbone to who
I am right now," Mulenga said.
"Without them I don't think I
would be the strong person I am
today."

Nancy Duff Campbell, founder and co-president of the National Women's Law Center speaks on women's representation
in the workforce at the Rackham Ampitheater Tuesday.

needs such as a temporary injury
-from playing soccer the previous
'weekend, Campbell said.
She added only 12 percent of
workers have access to paid family
leave from their employer and
more than 40 million workers
don't have paid sick days, which
she attributes to women's
decreased involvement in the
workforce. The Family Medical
Leave Act also doesn't - cover
workers in companies with under
50 employees, meaning 50 percent
of all workers go without these
benefits, she said.
Campbell said more than one
in five mothers would get a raise
if the federal minimum wage
went up to $10.10. Though raising
the minimum wage would affect
many low wage workers, she said
it would affect over 15 million
women specifically who are
supporting their families on low-
"wage jobs.
Campbell concluded the lecture
by explaining ways to improve
women's economic agenda. She

advocated specifically for the
Paycheck Fairness Act, which is
designed to close loopholes in the
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009
and will help prevent further pay
discrimination between men and
women.
She also discussed the Strong
Start for America's Children
Act, which will fund education'
programs for children from birth-
to-age-five as well as the Fair
Minimum Wage Act. She said she
believes will not only provide low
wage with a more reasonable pay
but will help closer the gender
pay gap and end up putting more
money back into the economy.
Campbell also emphasized
the importance of collective
bargainingandunionmembership.
"Women in unions not only
earn more, they are paid more
equally. Among union members
the wage gap between women
and men is half the size of the gap
between women and men who are
not union members," Campbell
said. "Collective bargaining also
empowers women and men to have
a voice in the work hours, their
scheduling practices, time off so
they can better attend to both their
work and family responsibilities."
Several students in various

women's studies classes at the
University were in attendance,
and expressed interest at the
real-world application of concepts
they'd discussed in class.
The event was co-sponsored
by the Center for the Education
of Women, the Ford School
of Public Policy, the Ginsberg
Center for Community Service
and Learning, the LSA Women's
Studies Department, the
Michigan Journal of Gender and
Law, Rackham Office of Graduate
Student Success and the Social
Work Learning Community on
Poverty and Inequality.
"I was surprised that it's so
frequently considered a women's
issue but a lot of stuff she talked
about was about was low wage
jobs and poverty issues," said
Leia Squillace, a Music, Theatre
& Dance junior. "As excited as
I am about the thought of pay
equality among genders, I think
the more underlying issue that
really needs to focused on is the
wage inequality overall, not solely
between genders."
Campbell will be on campus for
one more week to complete her
month working on her paper and
time as part of the Visiting Social
Activist program.

A crisis of ignorance
Sexual assault on campus can be reduced through education
Sexual assault on college campuses is enabled by a multi-
tude of influences, but cultural perceptions of women and
sex undoubtedly have a significant effect. While ill-intent
may play an undeniable role in many sexual assaults, ignorance
and societal factors are equally at work, if not more influential.
Educating university students and faculty about sexual assault
may not directly help survivors, but creating a foundation of
knowledge and compassion could potentially prevent these
awful crimes from happening in the first place.

Focusing on tc

When I told Dan Wang,
the editorial page editor
of The Michigan Daily
that I wouldn't
have this column
submitted on
time, he told me
to take the week
off. He'd find a l
way to fill the
content on short
notice. While DEREK
I am beyond
appreciative WOLFE
of his support,
I didn't and
couldn't listen. The truth is that
this week, especially, I needed to
write. I needed a chance to muse
and reflect in between studying for
my upcoming exams and papers.
Let me tell you why.
Last Wednesday my step-
grandmother - Nani, as her
family knew her - passed away.
Though I have included the "step"
designation, by all accounts she was
my grandmother. No question about
it. She loved and treated me as one
of her own, even thoughI came into
her life nearly nine years after I was
born. To her, it didn't matter, and
I could not be more grateful. Not
many people can say they had three
grandmothers who deeply cared
about them.
I'm lucky Ann Arbor is so close
to my family because on Tuesday
night, my stepbrother drove us to
the hospital in West Bloomfield,
where I had a chance to say goodbye
one last time. Her brutal battle in
and out of rehabilitation centers
due to heart problems and several
falls ended its final chapter.
Of course, death of family and

friends happens to everyone. My
situation isn't unique, and I don't
want to portray it as such. That
beingsaid, despite all that is written
about death, it gets overlooked that
coping never gets easy. At least in
my experience.
We had known her days were
numbered since January. The next
time she would have to go to the
hospital would likely be the end. So
naturally, I, and I'm sure the rest of
my family, tried to mentally prepare
for her departure from this-earth.
It started as an occasional
thought, butthe feelings accelerated
significantly after hearing she was
back in the hospital last week. The
outlook from a broken hip in old age
is nearly always grim.
"She'll no longer be suffering," I
told myself. "No one should have to
live like she did over the past year."
And so for a while I thought I'd
be fine. It was her time to go.
You have the funeral. You sit
Shiva (if you're Jewish). You move
on knowing that you had great
times together.
And for a couple of days, that was
my mindset. However, after being
updated by my dad last Wednesday
evening that she was in her final
moments, memories started
rushing back to me.
This was going to be harder than'
I thought. All the preparing I had
done was for naught.
Eventhoughshewasunconscious
the previous evening when I saw
her, I felt emptier knowing that she
was actually gone. A woman who
had affected my life in so many
positive ways wasn't there in flesh
anymore and would never be again.
There was never going.to be a

day
next time. There would be no more
family dinners with her there. No
more conversations about school
and life. The days at her pool where
she would feed us until we were
bloated were all officially just
wonderful memories now.
She could no longer tell me how
she was going to bake cookies for
me and mail them to Ann Arbor. I
never received that package. And
now I never will.
She was a wonderful, generous
lady who sported an incredible
hairstyle - a blonde poof. I know
I said it earlier, but I'm so thankful
to have known her and loved her.
And that made this past weekend
especially difficult.
Preparing for a loved one's death
feels like a natural thing to do. We
want to cope as best we can. Sure,
you want to get some logistical
details in order, like funeral
arrangements, but the reality is that
the mental gymnastics isn't worth
it. It's impossible to prepare. You're
going to fall down at some point.
And you know what, that's OK.
Because to put it bluntly, mourning
sucks, and forcing yourself to "keep
it together" doesn't prove anything
to anyone. There's nothing wrong
with letting emotion take over, at
least for a little while.
We only have so much control over
our thoughts, so it just makes sense
to exhibit control as best we can.
We can do this by fully enjoying
the time we have with the people we
love. Stay in the present. That's why
it's agift.
I think that's how the sayinggoes.

According to the controversial first report
published April 2014 by Not Alone, a White
House Task Force created by President Barack
Obama in an attempt to address sexual assault
on college campuses, approximately one in
five women ranging from freshmen to seniors
indicated that they had been sexually assaulted
at some time during their college experience.
Despite typical critiques of data sampling, each
one of these responses indicate an individual
scarred by the traumatic experience of
sexual assault who felt the need to share this
information for a greater good.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of
Education's Office of Civil Rights has their
hands full investigating78 universities charged
with mishandling sexual assault cases on
their campuses, including the University of
Michigan. In a study conducted by the Air
Force Academy in 2003, female students who
came forward to talk about their experiences
described the problem of sexual assault as
"widespread and the product of a culture
hostile toward women."
Advocates for Human Rights and The First
World Report on Violence and Health indicate
that :sexual assault seems to correlate with
social conditions - societies that honor male
physical aggressiveness, entitlement and
dominance generally have higher numbers of
sexual assault. Further exploration of sexual
roles of the "male aggressor" and the "demure
female" finds that "No" is seen as a kind of
obstacle that the male must overcome because
he is "not convinced she means it."
* This kind of aggression is unfortunately
well known on the college party scene. In
this regard, the University's Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Center notes on
their website, "Alcohol use may raise certain
expectations about gender under the influence
of alcohol. Men/masculine individuals may feel
as though they are expected to be sexually/
physically aggressive, and may also ascribe
to discourse about the sexual availability of
women/feminine individuals who drink."
Faced with the facts that nearly one in five
women will be sexually assaulted during
college, that 78 universities are under federal
investigation for mishandling of sexual assault
cases, and our culture is primed with male
sexual entitlement and the objectification
of women, it's not a question of should the
University do something to stop this alarming
trend; it's what are the fastest and most
effective means of preventing sexual assault on
our campus?
If society does deserve some blame for these
sexual abuses, then part of the problem must
lie in how students think of and understand
it. A 2010 study by The Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at
the University of Indiana found 10.9 percent of
survey respondents don't consider it "having
sex"if there's noejaculation,29 and 27.1 percent
don't consider performing or receiving oral sex
to be sex, respectively, and 55.1 percent don't
consider touching or manually stimulating a
partner's genitals to be sex either, indicating
that many sex-related crimes may be attributed
to ignorance. These blurred or misguided
definitions of what constitutes a sex act may
lead to sexual assault if the offender doesn't
consider certain acts tobe "real" sex.
The legal definition of sexual assault
generally refers to any unwanted sexual
activity. The 2010 study's findings point toward
a societal failure to adequately educate people
about sex and therefore sexual assault. Current
sex education briefly explains what sex is and

the different ways to have sex while thoroughly
covering sexually transmitted diseases. Sexual
abuse, however, is often not covered or simply
skimmed over, making it appear less important.
A more productive route would be to
educate students from a young age, eventually
developing a working knowledge of sex and
its potential for abuse as students come of
age. Confronting this issue head-on would
force students to consider the seriousness of
sexual assault as much as, if not more than,
the other risks of sex. However, changes
made for younger generations still leaves the
current student body without any immediate
confrontation with issues surrounding
sex and sexual assault. To compensate for
this, the University should lead the way by
addressing problematic cultural norms and
educating students about sexual rights.
It's unreasonable and unrealistic to place
all responsibility for student safety on the
University, but the school clearly cares about
the well-being of its students and can do more
to protect them. This begins with educating
and engaging the student body in a continuous
discussion about sex and<consent.It's important
to combat complex problems like sexual assault
at the source in order to cut down on its
recurrence - preventing a tragedy is always
better than having to deliver post-trauma care.
Currently, the University offers Haven
- an online course for incoming students
to complete the summer before freshman
year - and Relationship Remix, a 90-minute
program covering approaches toward healthy
relationships at the beginning of freshman
year. Both of these programs are described as
required, but are not seriously enforced.
The logical aim for the University should be
to implement a mini-course that is required
for all incoming students. This course
may model the current Race and Ethnicity
Requirement in its mandatory and academic
nature, or just a more in-depth orientation
type course similar to AlcoholEdu that
includes a regular discussion component.
This requirement should apply to all students
and take place during freshman year to
address the issue as a preventative measure,
instead of retroactively.
The class, more far-reaching than current
protocol, allows for time to discuss the factors
contributing to sexual assault, as well as the
definition of consent, the effects of misogyny
in our daily lives, how to step in as a bystander
and methods of practicing safe sex. Engaging
student conversation is key, as merely
presenting a slew of facts and numbers through
a computer screen can hardly be expected to
elicit any real empathy from students.
Of course, the implementation and
extension of a complete course takes
time and isn't immediately feasible.
Possible intermediary solutions include
comprehensive online courses or non-
academic weekly courses taught in the dorms
in a comfortable setting. The University
should explore its potential to truly engage
students and illustrate the significance of
consent. Michigan has the capacity to play a
key role in the protection of - and awareness
among - its students and faculty.
Gender roles and sex are shapedby societal
norms, and the effect this has on student
perception of sex and women cannot be
understated. Combating sexual crimes means
addressing ignorance, and the University has
an opportunity now to lead the way in sexual
education and prevent rape and assault on
campus.

Redefining flattery

ELLA ATKINS I
Quadrotor ban raises serious questions

he University of Michigan is an
undoubtedly unique school. According
to 2014 rankings from U.S. News, the
University is number 29 on
a list of the nation's best
colleges. Recently, it's been
ranked as the 15th-best
party school in the country
(one above Michigan State
University; go blue!). Not
only do we maintain strong
academics, we also dish out
a notable party scene. RENNIE
A few weeks ago, I was PASQUINELLI
immersed in my first Wel-
come Week. It primarily
consisted of aimlessly wandering around sorority
row in attempts to find parties that didn't have-
a line circling the respective fraternity house.
True to its title as the 15th best party school, par-
ties weren't hard to find. I, along with my three
female friends and one male friend, got into each
party we waited in line for, based largely off of
the fact that there were more girls in our group
than guys. "Where are your bitches?" I heard
one member of a fraternity ask a group of guys
that were waiting in line without their expected
female counterparts. Aside from this approach
being particularly misogynistic, it makes these
parties predominantly female-populated with
dispersed groups ofguys who were lucky enough
to have made the cut.
The sense of entitlement of the boys that I
encountered was absolutely astounding; a boy asked
me to dance and subsequent to my rejection of the
request, he forcibly grabbed my waist when a new
song came on and said, "I waited my turn." This
behavior is certainly not reflective of all males at the
University, but there does seem to be a large amount
of these types of guys at large parties. The seeming-
ly permitted behavior partly stems from the alcohol,
I would imagine. Another factor is the general sex-
ism and misogyny that surrounds every female in
all environments, not just festivities.
Most girls have heard something along the
lines of "you should be flattered that men think
of you in that way," implying that unsolicited
sexual advances are something to be wanted
and prideful of. This being said, every time a guy
grabs a girl's waist and pushes it into his crotch
isn't always a reflection of sexual desire, but per-
haps just a desire for a dance partner. But, why
does that make it any better? Frat culture, and

American culture in general, has taught the het-
erosexual male population that if they're dance
partner-less, grabbing whoever is closest is pretty
much acceptable.
Because ofithat, it's difficult for girls at parties
to determine why they were the chosen objects
of a particular male's desire. I sat down with an
anonymous group of three females who regularly
attend parties thrown by fraternities and asked
them basic questions about their treatment at an
average party. When I asked them how they felt
about an unknown man grabbing their waist as a
way to initiate dancing without consent, they all
said that they feel flattered in that kind of situa-
tion, but preferred the dance partner to ask first.
When I asked them the second question, however,
the responses were much different.
"Do you think it's flattering when aboy doesn't
see your face or what you look like, but still danc-
es with you without consent?"
"Not at all flattering! I am not an object. That's
disrespectful and rude."
"No. It's rude. Like I'm a person not a freaking
pole you can grind all up on."
"No, then I feel like I'm just being used so he
can feel good..."
This logic, unintentionally of course, is exem-
plary of ideas that uphold frat culture. We live in
a society where girls believe that it's flattering if
a boy welcomes them because of their looks (who
doesn't want to feel pretty?), but when the lust
stems from general sexual desire, the flattery
often disappears. The latter half of this belief is a
perfectly rational and progressive belief to have,
in my opinion. But the former part is question-
able. Why should girls be flattered by actions that
are rooted ina place of disrespect and misogyny?
The answer: they shouldn't be. A girl shouldn't
be flattered when a man forcibly initiates a form
of dancing that resembles having sex with clothes
on. Even if the man doesn't have any intention of
further sexual contact, the nature of this action is
inherently chauvinistic, and sustains structural
power relations between males and females.
So, for any girl out there reading this: the next
time a guy doesn't ask to dance with you, dances
with you and essentially has intercourse with you
while being clothed, be mindful that your body is
yours, you have the right to say no, and what he is
doing isn't flattering.

A Federal Aviation Administration ruling recent-
ly halted a historic event and violated a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling in doing so. The University's aerospace
engineering department, the first such department
in the United States, celebrated its centennial anni-
versary this past week. More than 200 alumni and
distinguished members of the aerospace community
attended the three-day event consisting of tours,
presentations, panel discussions and celebratory
dinners. As is tradition at, Michigan, the celebra-
tion ended with a football game at the Big House. To
commemorate the centennial, a number of vintage
airplaneswere approved to fly over the stadium, and
a small quadrotor would carry the game ball down
the field as part of a pregame ceremony organized
by a model aircraft hobbyistand a local startup com-
pany. This quadrotor flightwas initially approvedby
the University.
I am director of the University's Autonomous
Aerospace Systems Lab, where Iconduct research in
autonomy, aviation safety and novel unmanned air-
craft. I also advise the Michigan Autonomous Aer-
ial Vehicles student team. This past week, visitors
toured my lab, and we engaged in lively discussions
mostly centered on the future ratherthan the past of
aerospace. The game would include elements of past
and future - really cool airplanes from our history
and a "drone" that just happened to also be able to
safely carry a football downthe field. Unfortunately,
what Ihad hoped would be an awesomely fun event
turned into a nightmare for me courtesy of the FAA.
University of Michigan cancels quadrotor flight
due to FAA lawsuit threats:
Centennial organizers worked closely with the
FAA to gain approval for a variety of historic air-
craft to fly over the stadium before and during the
game. These airplanes would fly low enough to be
clearly visible to the crowd but certainly not so low
that they might risk impacting the stadium struc-
ture. A TFR, or temporary flight restriction, was
issued as is conventional for major stadium events;
the TFR prevents other aircraft from flying over or
near the stadium. An avid hobbyist, Peter Baumeler
from Traverse City, Michigan, asked the University
to be part of the event by operating the quadrotor
carrying the game ball down the field. He engaged
local Ann Arbor startup SkySpecs, whose employees
are primarily University alumni and former MAAV
team members who had dreamed as undergradu-
ates of somehow connecting their quadrotor to the
famed football venue. Peter, SkySpecs and the Uni-
versity worked arduously to ensure the flight would
be safe in the presence of so many spectators. The
team rehearsed, analyzed the impact of spectator
cell phones on communication links and carefully
addressed each problem.
In the ideal case, the football would success-
fully be flown across the field. In the worst case,
the flight would be terminated over an empty field,
falling ingloriously but safely to the ground. There
would have been no danger to aircraft flying above
he stadium or to the crowd. The quadrotor in ques-
tion would have emerged from the tunnel and flown
a maximum of 23 feet above the stadium floor. This
maximum height was below the bleachers, lower
than most of the stadium structure and well below
overhead Skycams on wires. In fact, because the
Big House is built into a depression in the ground,

the quadrotor would have actually remained below
ground level throughout its flight. SkySpecs engi-
neers volunteered their time and equipment, hob-
byist Peter Baumeler trekked from Traverse City to
Ann Arbor several times to plan and practice, and
the aerospace department thought this would be a
great wayto celebrate our centennial atthe game.
The day before the game, the FAA threatened to
bring a lawsuit against the University if the flight
was conducted. Despite an offer to deliver the ball
with the quadrotor continuously tethered by strong
ropes to handlers on the ground, the FAA stood its
ground in banning the flight. There was no indica-
tion of which (if any) of the code from 14 CFR - in
the code of Federal Regulations - would have been
violated, and there was no response to the Univer-
sity's offer to fly with a tether.
The question of "Who owns the sky?"
The FAA's decision to threaten suit against the
University for a small football-carrying quadrotor
flown 23 feet above the Big House turf makes it clear
the FAA has firmly staked a claim to the air inside
the Big House. The University might secure approval
from the FAA for a future Big House quadrotor flight
through a Certification of Authorization, exemption
or waiver. However, none of these mechanisms will
improve safety of flight as the University is expected
to "self-certify" its aircraft in the end. Furthermore,
these steps don't resolve the larger question of who
owns the air or sky inside the Big House.
The Ann Arbor Municipal Airport is within a few
miles of the Big House. Except for times when TFRs
are issued due to stadium events, general aviation
aircraft are able to fly over the stadium. When Fin-
lay Beaton, Michigan Flyers chief flight instructor
and long-time certified flight instructor - instru-
ment (CFII) - was told about the FAA's ban of the
quadrotor flight, he offered the following: "I am
completely confused as to how a quadcopter deliv-
ering a football would impact safety at the U of M
game. Bottom line is there is no impact to safety."
Regardingunmanned aircraft flight more generally,
he indicated, "If they (UA) keep away from airports
and below safe altitudes for (manned) airplanes,
then I've got no problem with that."
In United States v. Causby .(1946), the U.S.
Supreme Court stated, "We have said that the air-
space is a public highway. Yet it is obvious that, if
the landowner is to have full enjoyment of the land,
he must have exclusive control of the immediate
reaches of the enveloping atmosphere ... The land-
owner owns at least as much of the space above the
ground as he can occupy or use in connection with
the land."
The University of Michigan owns the Big House
and the land surrounding it. Clearly the air inside
the stadium is used by the University to allow
the crowd and media cameras to view and enjoy
the game. We must support the FAA, NASA and
other government agencies engaged in developing
unmanned aircraft policy to appropriarely manage
the risks introduced by UA flight through navigable
airspace. We also must be vigilant to ensure this
policy respects the rights of landowners to exclu-
sively control their "immediate reaches" airspace.

Hillary Clinton highlights
gender as 2016 approaches

Cadillac to ditch Detroit for
trendy NYC headquarters

Clinton involved
in fundraising for
female candidates
NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary
Rodham Clinton's 2008 presi-
dential campaign emphasized
her experience, competence and
preparation to become presi-
dent. Her 2016 pitch could be
simpler: She'd be the first female
president.
As Clinton considers a second
White House bid in 2016, she is
making a pronounced case for
female empowerment and the
role of women in the nation's
economy and politics. From the
stage of the annual Clinton Glob-
al Initiative to the campaign
trail, the former secretary of
state has emphasized breaking
barriers and the need for female
leadership - themes that could
resonate in a future campaign
in which women voters will be
critical.
"Don't let anyone dismiss
what you're doing today as
women's work," Clinton told a
women's leadership forum last
week at the Democratic National
Committee. "Don't let anyone
send you back to the sidelines."
Along with her husband,
former President Bill Clinton,
the former first lady spent the
week highlighting the role of
women leaders this week at
their family's annual confer-
ence. The ex-president spoke
to Chilean President Michelle
Bachelet about the challenges
female leaders face. Other panels

featured General Motors CEO
Mary Barra and IBM CEO Ginni
Rometty, the first female heads
at their respective companies.
Mrs. Clinton is raising money
for Democratic women run-
ning in the 2014 elections and is
expected to campaign for Demo-
crats in the coming weeks. In
Iowa, she praised Democratic
congressional candidate Staci
Appel, noting thatthe early pres-
idential state has never elected a
woman to Congress or governor.
During her DNC speech last
week, Clinton rattled off the
names of 10 Democratic women
whom she said gave her hope,
from candidates for governor
like Mary Burke of Wisconsin
and Wendy Davis of Texas to
Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisi-
ana, Kay Hagan of North Caro-
lina and Jeanne Shaheen of New
Hampshire.
The former New York sena-
tor's remarks frequently touch
on a number of policy issues
important to woman. Clinton
called for a "movement" to bring
equal pay, access to child care
and raising the minimum wage,
reminding her audience that
two-thirds of minimum wage
earners are women.
Anytime she is introduced,
speakers invariably mention
Clinton's 1995 United Nations
speech in Beijing, when she
declared that "human rights are
women's rights and women's
rights are human rights."
Her campaign message to
women wasn't always so explic-
it; her advisers were concerned
that being a woman could hurt

her with male voters.
When Clinton sought the
presidency in 2007 and 2008, her
team presented her as a strong
leader - in the mold of the late
British Prime Minister Marga-
ret Thatcher - with the tough-
ness and experience to lead the
nation. One of her most memo-
rable television ads involved a 3
a.m. phone call, which implied
her Democratic primary oppo-
nent, Barack Obama, wasn't
ready to respond to a crisis.
But when she ended her cam-
paign amid praise for her tenaci-
ty, Clintongave what might have
been a preview of her approach
to the gender question, noting
she hadn't shattered the White
House's glass ceiling, but had
left 18 million cracks in it - a
reference to the votes she won in
the primaries.
Six years later, one of her
main priorities at the Clinton
Foundation is a project.called,
"No Ceilings," aimed at empow-
ering women around the planet.
"There may be new attention
to these issues, especially as
we've plateaued in some impor-
tant indicators, but she proposed
universal (pre-kindergarten)
and national paid leave in '07
and '08 and those issues have
only gained in importance in
the last few years," said Neera
Tanden, a former Clinton policy
adviser who leads the Center for
American Progress.
In a nod to her past, Clinton's
speeches now often include
anecdotes emblematic of the
barriers many women have
faced in the work force.

General Motors'
division makes move
after 112 years
DETROIT (AP) - Cadillac
wants a jolt from the city that
never sleeps.
General Motors' 112-year-old
luxury car division, founded in
Detroit and named for the city's
founder, is moving its head-
quarters to New York.
Cadillac, which has been
steadily losing sales to its Ger-
man rivals, wants to get closer
to its ideal buyers. Executives
and marketing staffers will set
up shop in a loft office in Man-
hattan's trendy SoHo neighbor-
hood starting next year.
"There is no city in the world
where the inhabitants are more
immersed in a premium life-
style thaninNewYork," Johann
de Nysschen, the brand's new
president, said in a statement
issued Tuesday announcing
the move. "It allows our team
to share experiences with pre-
mium-brand consumers and
develop attitudes in common
with our audience."
Cadillac will become a sepa-
rate business unit, giving it
more freedom to chase global
growth. Most product engi-
neering and design will remain
in Detroit. Cadillacs will con-
tinue to be built at plants in
Michigan, Texas, Canada,
Mexico and China.
The company is still evaluat-
ing which employees go to New
York, but spokesman David

Caldwell said it's likely fewer
than 100 people will move in
the first phase next year.
Allen Adamson, manag-
ing director of branding firm
Landor Associates in New York,
said the advantage of New York
is its proximity to the luxury
market.
"You have to catch trends
closer to potential buyers,"
Adamson said. "There are more
hedge fund billionaires in NYC
than there are in Detroit. The
team will be closer to the lux-
ury market and luxury users."
Adamson said it's also less
important today for car brands
to be linked to manufactur-
ing centers like Detroit. Fiat
Chrysler's new global head-
quarters will be in London, for
example.
"Cars today are less about
the functionality of wheels and
transmission and-more about
total experience: music, com-
puter integration, the experi-
ence driving it. I don't think
the expertise is necessarily
tied to a particular geography,"
he said.
Right now, New York is
Cadillac's fourth-best U.S.
market, behind Texas, Flori-
da and Michigan. That could
change, although analysts say
most consumers won't know
where the brand is headquar-
tered. GM is also the maker of
Chevrolet, Buick and GMC.
Corporate moves are some-
thing of a specialty for de Nys-
schen, who became Cadillac's
chief in August. He was head
of Audi's U.S. division when it

moved its U.S. headquarters
from suburban Detroit to Vir-
ginia in 2007. In 2012, he took
over Nissan's luxury Infiniti
brand, which had just moved
its headquarters from Japan to
Hong Kong. Infiniti struggled
immediately after the move,
but new products helped its
sales jump 30 percent in the
first half of this year.
Cadillac sales are up 10
percent worldwide through
August. Sales are up 70 per-
cent in China, where the newly
revamped CTS sedan just went
on sale.
But in the U.S., Cadillac isn't
performing as well. Sales have
slumped nearly 5 percent this
year despite well-reviewed new
vehicles like the ATS coupe and
XTS sedan.
U.S. luxury car sales have
grown at more than double the
pace of non-luxury car sales
so far this year. But Cadillac
is missing out on those buy-
ers. Audi sales are up nearly
15 percent, BMW is up almost
12 percent and Mercedes-Benz
is up 9 percent, according to
Autodata Corp. Toyota's Lexus
luxury brand posted a 16 per-
cent increase through August.
GM's product development
chief, Mark Reuss, said Tuesday
that Cadillac's sales have been
disappointing. Reuss said Cadil-
lac is making good products but
needs better support from mar-
keting. The move to New York
should help that, he said.
"We need to get some fresh
thinking into that brand," he
said.

'The Tombstones' a
gritty noir revamp

Frank replaces
action thrills with a
solemn Neeson
By JAMIE BIRCOLL
Daily Film Editor
This is not "Taken." This isn't
"Nonstop" or "Unknown." This
is sharp, gritty film noir set in
the under-
belly of New
York City,
but it's not A Walk

the pure-at-
heart are the
homeless - no glistening sky-
scrapers 'wafching over the good
people, only grey and dark and
gloom, and a man, with his own
demons, who slips in and out of
the shadows.
That man is Liam Neeson,
and at last, in "A Walk Among
the Tombstones," he is presented
with a film for which his impos-
ingstature and actinggravitas are
put to good use. Here, he is not
the badass running around the
city killing all those who stand
in his way, dropping threatening
phone calls and occasional one-
liners in an only mildly concealed
Irish accent. Instead, his badas-
sery stems from screen presence
alone, in the way the camera sits
at his back as he walks through
the rain of a dark fall night, slight-
ly slouched to broaden his already
large 6'4 frame. God he's cool.
Neeson plays Matt Scudder, a
retired cop and recovering alco-
holic who now works as an unli-
censed private eye, unbound by
the law. Through a fellow AA

burning mystery that progresses
at a sometimes uneven pace as
Scudder works a particularly
unglamorous case - unglamor-
ous in that it's sometimes kind of
boring. The job consists of a lot of
research, a lot of discussing and
a lot of sitting, contemplating,
replaying events. The adrenaline
junkie should find his fix some-
where else.
But writer-director Scott
Frank ("Minority Report") opts
to replace those action-thriller
cliches with something more
thoughtful: his leading man.
Notice how many shots there are
of Neeson with his back to the
camera just staring or walking,
and notice how effective they
are at setting the solemn tone of
this New York underworld. Mar-
vel at the camerawork as it pans
from Neeson's face, tracking his
eyes first to the right to the man
he's following, then to the left to
the man who's following him.
Frank submerges the viewer in
this wo'rldthis throwback to the
archetypal days of film noir. All
those classic noir flourishes (the
hero patiently waiting in the dark
room reveals himself to a suspect

with an updated yet natural feel.
Supporting turns by Ste-
vens and Brian "Astro" Bradley
("Earth to Echo"), as a spunky
homeless kid Scudder takes under
his wing, are welcome, but it's the
few scenes that put Scudder with
cemetery groundskeeper James
Loogan (6lafur Darri lafsson)
that really shine. Olafsson, best
known as The Yellow King of
"True Detective," brings just the
right amount of weird and vulner-

they were more plentiful.
Because "A Walk Among the
Tombstones" is just one book in a
19-book series by Lawrence Block,
one can only hope for more Matt
Scudder. The film is something
of a throwback, taking place in
1999 - the decade of "Seven"
and "Primal Fear" and "The
Silence of the Lambs." Movies like
"Tombstones" are rare these days;
they'renthe kinds that don't explode
in your face but forceyou to take
in the gravity of the moment, to
experience the darkness and
to hope that the man in the
shadows is on your side.

lasting impact - the dichotomy
between real and not real, gen-

and rumors. And the result is

Karady to depict
transition from war

Why does our
generation shy from
classical music?

prised and interested to notice
the intensity of this contradic-
tion in her first interview.
"He said 'I would go back
there again in a second.' He's
dying to go back, he would love
to go back. So -there are a lot of
conflicted emotions about their
experiences."
The photographs, meticu-
lously composed over the course
of a month or so, are intended to
convey this.
For this particular exhibit,
student contribution played an
integral role. Aside from the stu-
dent veterans, Karady worked
with sound engineers and a
group of art students. The art stu-
dents helped in the planning and
execution of each photo shoot, in
addition to location scouting.
"The thing about this project is
that it's really interdisciplinary,
so that it's going to appeal to lots
of different kinds of students,"
Karady said. "It was interest-
ing to talk after interviews about
impressions, and I had never let
anyone into the interview process
before," Karady.
The project offers a bold and
fresh exploration of war and
its significance to society. A
theme that is almost exclusively
revealed to us through news
and media will be addressed
in an intimate light. The inten-
tion is that "some eyes might be
opened," Karady said. Surely,
with appeal to such broad inter-
ests, Soldiers' Stories will do
just that, and likely more.

ast Thursday,
Beethoven's music was
given new life by the
Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra
and Andre Watts for the Hill
Auditorium's Beethoven Festival.
Watts, a
German-
born pianist,
is truly a *
modern-day-
classical
music
superstar, a -
child prodigy KATHLEEN
turned DAVIS
virtuoso
performer,
who has maintained relevance
in the classical community
for decades. The press geared
towards students for this concert
was mostly lost amongst the
announcement for Schoolboy
Q's upcoming show and the
Pussy Riot Stamps Lecture, both
incredible events, but ones that
left Beethoven's music out on the
fringe.
Like manyyoungadults my
age, I do not mention classical
music when.I'm asked what
kind of music I like, or what my
favorite songs are. It's a genre
that for me has fallen to the
wayside, discarded amongst
wrapped mint candies, dentures
and the geriatric.
All musical genres take cues
and inspiration from their
predecessors. Modern rap
evolved from funk, blues and
spoken word poetry; country
music has come from western
swing music and bluegrass;
EDM draws from disco and '80s
techno.
This Andre Watts visit made
me wonder- how did classical
music, once considered the
highest form of entertainment,
become nearly irrelevant to this
generation? If we're to believe

work has been significantly
promoting this show and it
could be one of the biggest hits
of the season. Fox also has its
surprise hit from the previous
year, "Sleepy Hollow," return-
ing the same night. "Sleepy
Hollow" has been off the air for
nine months, and it remains to
be seen whether it can keep the
momentum it built last season.
Even if the show simply match-
es its numbers from the previ-
ous year it'll be considered a
win for Fox.
While the Monday pre-
mieres should create some-
thing to build upon, the rest
of Fox's schedule is collapsing.
The question going forward:
Does Fox exhibit patience with
"Utopia" and "Red Band," or do
they pull them in favor of some-
thing else? It has a lot in the
pipe for midseason, but I'm not
sure how many of those shows
could be ready to premiere in
the next six weeks. Fox has a
ringer in "Masterchef Junior,"
but, that show being a legiti-
mate triumph in its Friday slot,
it seems an unlikely play. The
network has a history of such
moves (it moved "Bones" off
Friday right as it was starting to
build momentum); "Masterchef
Junior" could be used in the
same fashion to save its sched-
ule.
Whatever Fox is going to do,
it's going to have to do it quick-
ly. If it's not careful, it'll turn
into a smoldering pile of dust.

It's hard to tell whether King
Tuff doesn't care or if he's just
trying too hard. Since releasing
his last self-
titled record
in 2012, Kyle
Thomas (aka Black
King Tuff) has
radicalized
his persona King Tuff
and it shows
on his latest Sub Pop
release, Black
Moon Spell.
Tuff offers a blend of original
style and influence in his latest
work, sounding like an unlikely
mixture of Frank Zappa, The
Shins and Billy Corgan of The
Smashing Pumpkins. Black Moon
Spell possesses some impressive
moments, transporting the lis-
tener back in time to other eras of
rock. However, at its worst, the
album is a giant cluster of low-
fi, whiny, ironic self-indulgence
that leaves the listener wonder-
ing if even Tuff himself likes the
end product.
At its strongest points, Black
Moon Spell delivers a refresh-
ing garage rock vibe that defies
the current trends in alterna-
tive rock. The title track deliv-
ers some crispy, distorted guitar
licks that exemplify King Tuff
at his musical best. "Black Moon
Spell" doesn't take itself too seri-
ously, like any other Tuff jam,
but the musical quality doesn't
suffer anycollateral damage. The
lyrics are fairly uninspiring, but
it's a pretty enjoyable mindless
journey speckled with impres-
sive retro guitar solos that leave
no doubt about Thomas's tech-
nical prowess. "Magic Mirror"
and "Rainbow's Run" also strike
a successful balance between
Tuff's tireless drive for satire and

Former player not pleased

RUBY WALLAU/Daily
TheMichigan men's cross country team's coach and captains have changed this season, but its expectations have not.
Wolverines cap tains not
sowilng with new coach

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
On Twitter over the last
four days, 2,000 people have
used #FireHoke and another
1,100 have used the words
'fire' and 'Hoke' in the same
sentence. The cry for change in
the Michigan
football NOTEBOOK
program has
gotten louder. Former players
are now speaking out following
last week's loss to Utah.
Former quarterback Michael
Taylor, who played for the
Wolverines from 1986-1990,
took to the airwaves Tuesday
morning on Detroit's 105.1FM to
share his thoughts on the state
of the program.
"Actions speak louder than
words," Taylor said. "What
we've become is a propaganda
football team, telling people
how great we are when we're
mediocre. When, in your last 12
games, you've only got victories
over Northwestern, App State,
Indiana and Miami (Ohio) that
is not good. That is not good.
"We're mediocre right now.
Will it stay that way? I don't
know. I don't work there. I don't
have the say-so. But I do know
this: I know a few hundred
players who are not happy with
what is going on and definitely
think changes need to be made."
Taylor, who led the
Wolverines to back-to-back Big
Ten championships in 1988 and
1989, also spoke out regarding

Athletic Director Dave Brandon.
"All I do know is Dave Brandon
should not be let to make another
dgion at Michigaii. Period,"
he said. "Regardless (of) what
they do (with Brandon), there
needs to be change."
Furrent players are starting
to take notice of the uproar from
fans everywhere.
,I took that to heart this
morning," said junior wide
receiver Dennis Norfleet. "They
were really talking down on.
coach Hoke saying that his time
is coming. Coach Hoke did a lot
for me and the team.
"There's more than football.
In life he's a good coach. And
right now, I don't feel, and the
team doesn't feel, that that's
right."
NO QUARTERBACK DECI-
SION: After telling the media
on Monday that a starting quar-
terback decision would be made
Tuesday, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke quickly changed his tune.
"We've got some ideas with
what we're going to do, but
we're still going to evaluate
it," Hoke said during the Big
Ten teleconference Tuesday
afternoon. "We'll probably end
up (deciding) later in the week.
"Any personnel decisions that
we make this week, we want to
make sure we're right and we
don't want to mislead (the media)
at all, we want to make sure we're
doing it the right way."
But when asked when the
decision would finally be made,
Hoke replied, "On Saturday, it

definitely will, be hammered
down."
So rest easy Michigan fans, a
-quarterback will start Saturday.
SIMILIAR START,
DIFFERENT FINISH?: Last
season, Michigan entered
Big Ten games at 4-0, but
barely squeaked by against
Akron and Connecticut. Once
the Wolverines entered into
conference play, the season
unraveled and Michigan
finished just 7-6.
This season, with two losses
entering conference play, the
rest of the season feels eerily
familiar. But 'Team 135' main-
tains it will end its season dif-
ferently.
"Speaking defensively, I
believe our defense is way better
than it was last year," said senior
defensive end Frank Clark.
"We're doing some great things
on defense."
But with the Wolverines'
struggles taking full hold during
conference season last year, this
team wants to change last year's
narrative.
"The biggest thing is learn-
ing from your mistakes," Clark
said. "If (your team) can learn
from the mistakes they've cre-
ated your possibilities are limit-
less. You can go places with that.
... When you learn from those
things you grow as a team, you
grow asa player."
But as Michigan has main-
tained after both losses, its goal
of winning aBig Ten champion-
ship is still out there.

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Editor
Mason Ferlic was in Ann
Arbor. Ben Flanagan was in
Canada.:And James Yau was in
Taiwan.
So of Michigan's three
current cross country captains,
only one was even in the United
States when the program
announced in June that head
coach Alex Gibby wouldn't be
returning.
But they were named
captains by their team last
week for a reason. Gibby may
have been gone, but the now-
captains weren't about to let his
old program falter.
Ferlic - who also traveled
to Sacramento, California and
Kamloops, British Columbia
for postseason track and field
competitions in the summer
- sent an email to the whole
team. He reminded the
Wolverines that none of their
expectations for the summer
and the following season had
changed.
"I guess (I) maybe just
reassured the guys," Ferlic
said. "Everyone runs to panic
scenarios about who the new
coach is going to be and how
everything's going to change.
Once you get over the jitters
that we're moving forward as
a program, everyone got back
into training."
What Ferlic said worked.
When the team got word of
Gibby's departure, Flanagan
drove back to Ann Arbor from
Kitchener, Ontario to be with
the team for a while. Assistant
coach Dusty Lopez helped
keep the team's training plan
in place. Michigan stuck to its

goals over the summer, putting
itself in position for a top-
25 ranking in the preseason
poll. Former Michigan runner
Kevin Sullivan replaced Gibby
and kept the program's basic
philosophy largely in place.
"I think it went very well in
terms of our mindset coming
into it, just accepting what
happened and knowing that
we've got to do whatever it
takes to push this program
forward," Yau said. "The
Athletic Department made
the decision that they thought.
was best for us, and going with
the flow helped us move into a
really smooth transition."
Then, days before his team
won the Big Ten Preview
in Iowa City, Iowa over the
weekend, Sullivan announced
that the team had electedFerlic,
Flanagan and Yau as captains
for the season. Together, the
trio helped ease any worries
about the coaching transition.
"The fear would be that with
the new coaching transition,
people feel like there's no
authority figure left in place,"
Ferlic said. "Nothing is changing
in terms of what we're trying to
accomplish as a team."
Yau, a fifth-year senior from
Troy, Michigan, is the oldest
member of the current squad.
Flanagan, just a sophomore,
was a ' second-team All-Big
Ten honoree last season. And
Ferlic, a -redshirt junior from
St. Paul, Minnesota, is another
experienced runner with a
strong track background.
The captains said the rest of
the team is a motivated group
on its own, though.
"I would like to ideally think
that I would act the same

regardless, but now that there's
a captain behind it, people look
up to you more," Flanagan said.
"The main thing is leading by
example.".
That leading started with the
unexpected news in June. Each
captain had only ever run for
Gibby, who took the program
from eighth in the Big Ten,
to tied for third, to second, to
second again in four seasons.
"When I came in four years
ago, the team was kind of
disoriented, and it took four
years for Gibby to build us up
to where we are now," Yau said.
"Having that solid foundation
that was built before Sullivan
came here definitely helped the
transition and allows us to take
the next step forward."
Though Gibby's cross
country program was on the
rise, the Wolverines didn't earn
enough points in long-distance
events in track to satisfy
Clayton.
So the cross country team's
concern over the summer was
valid, but as it turned out,
Sullivan didn't reshape very
much at all.
"To give credit to Gibby, he
didn't leave the program in
shambles," Ferlic said. "We
had talent developing, 'and
we already had talent there.
.We had the makings of a good
program, so when (Sullivan)
stepped in, he didn't really have
-to reorder everything.
'"When he saw the program
and observed it and got to
know us, he realized things
were there and he didn't have
to overhaul anything. He could
make the tweaks he wanted to.
He was left with a good basket
of eggs."

confirmed.
And though commercialization is with-
in the Athletic Department's contractual
rights, it doesn't mean fans are always
receptive.
Last year, a macaroni and cheese noodle
'im Kraft in the north side of the stadium
upset fans enough that it was removed from
the premises within a week. The march-
ing band, once used as the primary form of
entertainment, is replaced by music played
through the speakers.
"If it wasn't broke, don't break it," Bacon
said, referring to the organic Michigan
Marching Band chants that once held the
place of piped in music. "Yes, things change,
and I get that."
"The most fundamental thing occurred
organically, from students, fans, the band,

ed to insure that our students can excel in
academics and in competition," Klawunn
wrote. "It is very important that our stu-
dents excel in both areas."
Klawunn added that Brown's athletics
do not attract similar audiences to those
at Michigan sporting events,
given the
smaller
7ze of the
school's student body and the
reputation of the Ivy League's
sports division in general.
Schlissel said during his three
years at Brown, the sum total
of ticket sales for athlet-
ics events probably did not
amount to that of one game in
the Big House.
As Provost, Schlissel over-
saw all of Brown's budgeting,
which includes athletics. At
the University of Michigan,
University Provost Martha
Pollack does not oversee fund-
ing for athletics. Instead,
Jason Winters, the Athletic
Department's chief financial
officer, oversees funding and
reports to Brandon, who in turn reports
to the University's governing Board of
Regents and the University President. As
Schlissel noted, the Athletics Department
at the University is entirely self-support-
ing - which is not a common funding
model when compared to nearly every
oYer national university.
By the numbers, Brown has 900 stu-
dent-athletes involved in 31 varsity sports.
In comparison, the University has 29 var-
sity sports with 931 students. Though the
percentage of student-athletes overall is
technically larger at Brown, the Univer-
sity's budget is larger. But that distinction,
however, comes with the University's

the 'Go Blue' cheer," he added. "We don't
need a scoreboard to tell us when to say 'Go
Blue' - we do that together. That is a place
that doesn't need tobe programmed."
University alum Ari Schorr, a market-
ing professional with Microsoft in Seattle,
understands that over time, Michigan ath-
letics will become more of a business.
"It doesn't bother me, it's just something
we have to accept about college sports,"
Schorr said. "There is a commercialization
in that it's almost like a professional sport."
At the end of the day, Michigan isn't a
professional sport. It's part of what people
like Jersevic pride about being a "Michigan
Man." After all, if Michigan is one of the
"leaders and best," does it need advertise-
ments to sell its brand?
"It doesn't bother me to the point where I
monumental athletic history.

It's clear that both athletics and aca-
demics are identifiable, historic aspects of

wouldn't come back," Jersevic said. "I think
it detracts from the Michigan tradition."
The game day experience at Michigan
is undergoing a change - one that moves
from selling itself independently, to one that
needs help being sold.
Lochmann and the marketing depart-
ment will continue to take advantage of
social media and online ticket ordering, uti-
lizing digital trends that continue to prog-
ress.
There will be piped in music and there
will be ads. It will be a business. It doesn't
have to be completely eliminated to still
have fans such as Jersevic or Rife or Neitzer
filling the stands. But it will.be difficult to
draw in audiences that aren't as faithful to
Michigan's history.
tee, said creating a theme semester was
the best way to do it - and potentially
launch more courses offered like this in
the future.
"We decided it would be really fun to
sponsor a theme semester on sport and
the university
 RUBY WALLAU/Dailyto highlight all
these intersec-
tions - and
to see what
departments
would come up
with related
to the theme,"
Curzan wrote
in a statement.
"And it has
been exciting to
see the range of
events and top-
ics that have
come together
around this
theme."
Physics Prof.
David Gerdes,
x who works
with Curzan as
co-leader of the theme semester, said the
courses in the theme semester encompass
a myriad of aspects of the complexity of
sports: ranging from the physics of base-
ball to the history of college football.
The Athletic Department will spon-
sor several events produced by the theme
semester. For the program's kickoff, a
panel titled "Game Plan: Achieving Suc-
cess at Michigan and Beyond" was com-
prised of several distinguished professors
and accomplished coaches, including
Men's Basketball Coach John Beilein. The
panel discussed how students can reach
their goals, whether they be in sports, aca-
demics or any other field.

For now, the program is banking on fans
that believe in tradition and have been
"brainwashed," like Neitzer, to love Michi-
gan football. , .
"The Big House is what bonds us," Bacon
said. "No matter what else you have going
on campus... it's the one building on cam-
pus where everybodyiswelcome, everybody
knows what to do. ,
"You feel that energy - 100,000 of your
best friends are all feeling the same emotion
at the exact same time. There's something
very electric about that; it's a very basic
human need, and you can't get that on TV.
That's what the department should be sell-
ing."
Curzan said thetheme semester aims to
encourage students and faculty to take a
closer look at how these two monumental
parts of the University of Michigan expe-
rience interact.
"At Michigan, you find passion for aca-
demics and passion for athletics," she
said. "And we don't think that we need to
see athletics and academics as inherently
or necessarily at odds with each other."
For Schlissel, findingabalance between
athletics and academics and forming an
understanding between the two is vital.
Though the numbers may be bigger for
Schlissel, he aims to ensure the Athletic
Department upholds one value: integrity.
Since Brandon reports directly to him,
Schlissel said they have meetings every
other week to ensure their communica-
tion runs smoothly. University Athletic
Department spokesman Dave Ablauf
described their partnership as "a good
working relationship," adding that they
have met several times for dinner in addi-
tion to their regularly scheduled meet-
ings.
To get a better grasp of the department,
Schlissel is aiming to attend at least one
event every year for each varsity sport the
department offers. This goal will allow
Schlissel to interact with what he calls the
most important part of the department:
the student-athletes.
"I want to make sure the student-ath-
letes get benefits from their program,"
Schlissel said. "I want to make sure our
athletics program operates with unques-
tioned integrity, with a focus on the
athletes and the experience the student-
athletes are having."
Athletics will remaina landmark to the
University experience. As Schlissel con-
tinues to adjust to his new leadership role,
his exact approach to working with the
Athletic Department will come through.

the University. In order to examine their
relationship to each other, this year's LSA
Theme Semester was created.
Each term, LSA creates a Theme
Semester to provide a more focused group
of classes to offer to its students. This fall,
the theme is "Sport and the University."
English Prof. Anne Curzan, who
serves as the faculty liaison to the Ath-
letic Department, is one of the leaders
and organizers of the theme semester.
The idea stemmed from a committee a
few years ago aimed to identify ways to
increase courses offered at the Universi-
ty relating to sport and physical activity.

V ann arbor affairs: me and my big bossy heart by carlinaduan

At a recent dinner, I was asked
to describe myself in three words
to a circle of friends. Outside, the
moon pouted, and we spooned
chili into our mouths, puckering
lips at the strange and salty heat. "I
think I'm funny," said one friend,
as I watched a piece of diced zuc-
chini swim through his bowl. "I'd
say I'm aloof," said another. When
it became my turn, I balked. My
friend struck his lighter, and the
flame rose, tenderly, to meet the
slow lip of the candle. "I think... I
think I have a bossy heart," I said,
surprising myself. "Like, my heart
owns me in a way... but maybe it's
just that I'm always in love."
When I got my heart kicked in
high school after a bad -breakup,
I walked around shiny-eyed -
wanting to touch and torch every-
thing. I painted my nails on the
porch, and the sharp, waxy scent
of polish rammed through the air.
When I clenched and unclenched
my fist, my fingernails glinted a
wicked red. I felt strangely pow-
erful. I couldn't get my heart to
shut up. While friends peppered
me with advice on how to quell an
achy heart, I spent
late nights
awake in
bed, blasting
electro-pop -
and drink-
ing galaxy
after galaxy
of skim milk.
My heart was
noisy - told
me to suck it up.
Years later, walk-
ing through the
Diag one morning, I
watched a boy with a cigarette
nested behind his ear; I watched a
woman flashing her arms in silver
rain. In the bathroom, my room-
mate called his boyfriend's name,
said, "I love you," softly, into the
wet sink. And his boyfriend said
it back.

In college, my
heart cracked when I
recognized the kid I
loved wasn't going to
say it back. At least,
not like that. I loved
him, but we were
friends, and when
we passed each other
on the street, we fist
bumped - his rocky
hand pulsing against
mine. Some nights we
would eat takeout on
the floor of my room,
amid black hairs pat-
terned on the floor-
boards like wires.
"Hey," he'd say, look-
ing up. "You want a
bite?"

ILLUSKAIUNS BY MEtAN MULHULLANL

When I say my heart's
bossy, I mean it's oversaturated
at times, with all the joy, all the
angst, memories of river walks
and collared shirts, all the love
I have for dozens and dozens of
people, dozens and dozens of plac-
es. Watery muscles. Heart seeped
with everybody I try
to love at all the
"right" times -
in all the "right"
ways.
In allowing
my heart to take
over my body, I
forget. The love
grows famil-
iar, feels dumbly
immovable. But it's
not. When I was in ele-
mentary school, my
sister ate strips of
salmon from a glass
container and talked about loneli-
ness on the swings, and my heart
hissed. The love rushed. So often,
my love for everybody sprawls
through windows. Whether I love
others as friends, sisters, dance
partners, strangers wearing pur-
ple scarves - it still surprises me
how over time, the love changes

shape. I start off loving somebody
as X, and as we both grow, it shifts.
Suddenly, I'm loving them as Y.
The love shimmies and evolves.
And sometimes, that feels bad. But
most of the times, it feels impor-
tant: unlearning a specific kind of
love I've had for somebody. Grow-
ing new love on top of it: thicker,
callused love.
Activist and writer Audre
Lorde notes, "Love is a movement.
Actually, love is the movement.
It is that which moves each of us
toward one another ... Indeed, the
radical potential in love is its abil-
ity to destroy the walls, fortifica-
tions, edges, spaces, which work
to separate us." What strikes me
about Lorde's observation is that
love not only moves and builds -
it also deconstructs. Whenever
my heart starts beeping inside my
body, I think about all its "abil-
ity to destroy the walls," but also
how necessary it is, sometimes, for
the heart to learn how to stretch.
When I say my heart is bossy, I
mean that my love stomps and
struts, and it's not shy about it. It
crashes often, it changes shape,
and by doing so, it grows.

Personal Statement: Life after skating

--. \

Six hours before Michigan is
set to kickoff against Miami
University (Ohio), Roland
Jersevic sets up his tent where the
i"ffoad tracks intersect Hoover
Street.
His truck is backed in, the tail-
gate is down and a 60-inch TV is
set up in the back. His TV stands
out, with a satellite and a pair of
speakers that face out to the street.
The table is there, near the grill,
with chairs that form a semicircle
around the truck. A former timer
for the track teams, Jersevic sits
alone now, adorning a blue vest
over a yellow sweater on an abnor-
mally chilly September Saturday.
Jersevic has done the same
thing for decades. He's been com-
ing since he was a freshman in
1970.
His friends will join him later,
as they always do, and he'll head to
his section in the stadium because
"a Michigan Man sticks by his
team," he says. Fans will walk by,
watch his TV and maybe strike up
a conversation.
And Jersevic wears a smile on
his face as if it's new to him every
Even as ticket prices rise, com-
mercials spread, schedules dis-
appoint and records fluctuate,
Jersevic - a Saginaw, Michigan
native - returns to his spot at
Hoover and the railroad tracks.
He'a £one of many, who despite

changes to the Football Saturday
experience, renew their season
tickets every year and show up,
ready to tailgate.
"This is a way of life," Jersevic
said. "We came here to Michigan
because it's a great school and this
is what makes it part of it."
There are people from all
around who have a similar view
as Jersevic, who are motivated to
return to a struggling program
because it's as engrained in them.
The program, after all, revels in
tradition.
Yet to many fans, the game day
experience at Michigan Stadium
has become more like a business
and less like an experience. But
does it need to be?
The parking lot at Ann Arbor
Pioneer high school fills up slow-
ly before Miami (Ohio) comes to
town. The RedHawks haven't won
in their last 18 games.
There are people like Lisa
Neitzer who tolerate the repeated
losses. She's been coming to games
with her family since she was a
young child. She parks her RV at
Ann Arbor Pioneer's parking lot.
It's decorated with block 'M's' and
the Big House and Wolverines and
the yellow striped helmets.
"This is something, instead of
going on a vacation with the fam-
ily, wherever Michigan goes, we
go," she says. "This is fun."

EVOLUTION OF

She sets up with her family out-
side the RV - paying the $225 to
park it kitty-corner from Michi-
gan Stadium. Neitzer will travel
to Piscataway, New Jersey in a few
short weeks to watch the Wolver-
ines game against Rutgers. And
later, she'll go to Evanston, Illinois
to see them play Northwestern.
Neitzer remembers watching
Bo Schembechler, Lloyd Carr, Rich
Rodriguez and now Brady Hoke
carry on the Michigan coaching
legacy. She went with her father to
the games when she was young, a
tradition which "brainwashed in
her," she described.
100 feet away from Neitzer,
Jackson resident Tyler Sebastian
throws a football back and forth
with his brother.
"There's just nothing else I
would rather do on a Saturday,"
Sebastian says. "I'll watch them
even if they do play smaller teams
or have rough weeks."
He shows up early because
these opportunities don't come
around often. He shows up early
because that's what he's done
since he was 13.
"The biggest thing that
brings fans to the Big House is
the need to be together, to have

shared values, to have that bar-
riers that are all too present too
often - race, religion, nationality,
age," said John U. Bacon, Univer-
sity lecturer and New York Times
best-selling author, in an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily.
"All of these things, whether
you're pursing poetry, engineer-
ing or Law - it's the one time of
the year when none of that mat-
ters where the second you walk
past the turnstile, all of it breaks
down."
Across Ann Arbor-Saline Road,
the Ann Arbor Country Club golf
course also fills up with fans who
begrudgingly pay the high price to
park heir car.
Eric Rife of Temperance, Mich-
igan;still shows up hours before
kickoff, setting up a grill with
venison wrapped in bacon. Since
the beginning of this season, he's
been coming to the games and gets
"chills" every time he walks into
the stadium.
For all the fans that return to
Ann Arbor for the game day expe-

rience, every year brings a whole
new set of Michigan fans to the
nation's biggest stadium - Rife
included.
"New fans are experiencing
Michigan Stadium that have never
experienced it before and we are
confident once they attend a game,
they will want to come back in the
future," said Hunter Lochmann,
Chief Marketing Officer within
the Athletic Department.
This season, Michigan's seven-
game home slate includes one
team with more than seven wins
- Minnesota, who fell to Michi-
gan last year, 42-13. The better
games are on the road, and ticket
prices, despite not rising, are still
more than a $1,000 investment for
regular season-ticket holders.
According to ticket data from
Craig Barker, a long-time fan and
blogger at the Hoover Street Rag,
ticket prices have increased by
$30 per game since 2000, averag-
ing to $65 per contest in the 2014
season. The Athletic Department
hasn't raised prices since 2012,
but the price per ticket is still at its

I don't remember the moment I fell in
love with figure skating, but I'm positive
it wasn't the moment I first stepped on the
ice.
My mom and one of her friends decided
to sign all of the kids up for group lessons
at the local community rink because it
was cheap, fun and, maybe, a good skill to
have for potential dates later in life. Armed
with a ladybug helmet, I took my first steps
toward what I was certain would be Olym-
pic fame. In my five-year-old mind, I knew
that I wouldn't be Michelle Kwan on my
very first day, but I expected at least basic
proficiency. I was royally pissed when I face-
planted after my first step on the ice. I decid-
ed right then and there that I was done with
this stupid sport, if only I could get back up.
Fortunately, one of the instructors scooped
me up and hand-delivered me to my class
before I could make my escape. It was some-
where around then that my love affair with
ice skating began.
Flash forward a few years later,iand things
have gotten serious between skating and me.

moments come from those years when I was
missing school, surviving on four hours of
sleep a night and skating was truly my whole
life.
What skating really gave me, from that
very first day until the day I hung up my
skates, was my identity. When people asked
what I did, I said competitive figure skat-
ing. When they asked who I was, it was
the name of the team I was on. While I've
found ways to fill the gaps in my schedule,
there's noclub or meeting that will ever com-
pare to a packed stadium or getting a stand-
ing ovation from hundreds of people. People,
tell me that I'll find something else I'll love
just as much, but I'm not so sure. I died a
little bit inside the first time I told someone
that "I used to skate," but I'm accepting the
reality of my first grown-up decision.
In truth, my love affair with figure skat-
ing never really ended, and I don't think it
ever fully will. It taught me how to push
myself to the absolute limit. My story is
about a little girl who fell head over heels
in love with figure skating, which gave me
experiences that shaped who I am today,
and will help me become the woman I
hope to be 15 years from now.

hen University
President Mark
Schlissel ran
into Michigan Stadium
minutes before the football
team's season opener, he
entered a world beyond the
sport. He entered a world
of tradition, history and
more than a few numbers.
With the usual crowd
of well over 100,000 fans
cheering in the largest sta-
dium in college football,
the atmosphere was.over-
whelming - and it should
be. After all, students paid
about $40 per game for
their seats - a fee that
ranked as the second high-
est in college football last
year, just .behind the Uni-
versity of Oregon. And for
the rest of the crowd, the
expense was larger, start-
ing at $70 for less notable
home games, like the con-
test with the University of
Maryland.
Working with numbers
is a familiar task for Schlis-
sel. Before becoming the
University's 14th president,
he served as Brown Uni-
versity's provost - a role
focused on the academic
and budgetary planning
for the University. His
previous experience with
athletics, however, does
not compare to the role
that athletics currently
plays at the University.
Though Brown Univer-
sity has 37 Division I var-
sity sports teams within
its department, it is in the
Ivy League - which is no
Big 10. Football tickets are
a mere $15 per game for
non-students, and fund-
ing for the program comes
as its own budget offered
from the Office of Student
Life at Brown which works
under a centralized fund-
ing model.
For Schlissel, the num-
bers at the University of
Michigan are just bigger.
Though his transition
comes with many hurdles,
taking hold of the Athletic
Department is a signifi-
cant one. To those outside
of academia and the alum-
ni pool, the University is
perhaps best known for
its Athletic Department.
Instead of building the
athletics brand to follow
its exponential upward
trend, Schlissel has said

he wants a balance between athletics and aca-
demics in University life - a value the Univer-
sity has held since its inception.
"What I want tobe sure of is that athletics
exist in an appropriate balance with every-
thing else the University does," Schlissel said
in a July press conference. "Athletics isn't part
of the mission statement of the University.
We're an academic institution, so I want to
work on the appropriate balance between ath-
letics and academics."
For Schlissel, however, the Athletic Depart-
ment influence is not slowing down anytime
soon - the numbers will only keep growing.
Big House bucks
It's easy to assess the University's athletic
reputation based on its successful programs.
The University's football team has the most
wins in college football - though a 2-2 win-
loss ratio for the first four games of the 2014
season weakens thatstatus in the modern con-
text.
But even as the winning percentage falls,
the Athletic Department's revenue and
expenditures are on the rise. During Univer-
sity Athletic Director Dave Brandon's tenure,
the department's operating revenues have
increased from $105 million in 2011 to $151
million in 2015 - which excludes the approxi-
mate $350 million budgeted for infrastruc-
ture and renovations at the Stephen M. Ross
Athletic Campus. At Brown University, the
school's athletics programworked with abud-
get of $11 million in 2013.
In comparison with a 43.8 percent increase
over the past four years, the Athletic Depart-
ment's revenue is now more than half of what
the state of Michigan appropriated to the Uni-
versity last year - $295 million.
Former University President Mary Sue
Coleman recommended Brandon's hiring and
highlighted athletes as a way to celebrate the
University's achievements as a whole. When
Schlissel was appointed last January, Brandon
said he admired Coleman's work, and antici-
pated Schlissel to share the same spirit.
"President Coleman has been engaged and
helpful and been a pattern of Michigan Ath-
letics - loves and respects the role it plays on
campus," Brandon said. "And I'm sure the new
president will have the same point of view."
Athletics remain an integral part of the
University of Michigan experience. With the
recent 2013 Final Four appearance by the
Michigan men's basketball team and Nov. 2013
football win against Michigan State in the Big
House, the celebration of sport and camarade-
rie is a defining moment in a University alum's
remembrance of college.
"I think every individual here is an expert
in athletics, which is incredible," Schlissel
said in an interview with The Michigan Daily.
"It's something that people pay great attention
to; it's a part of the culture. I couldn't change
that even if I wanted to."
And Schlissel's not the only one to think
that athletics are a huge part of the campus
culture. University Lecturer John Bacon, a
prominent sports journalist and author, said
the Michigan athletics experience should be
an organic one which transcends the bound-

aries usually presented between students who
may be separatedby age, socioeconomic class,
race or ethnicity.
"It's the one time of the year when none of
that matters, where the second you walk past
the turnstile, all of it breaks down," Bacon
said. "If you know when to jam your fist into
the air and sing 'Hail,' then you're one of us.
And we're all connected and we all belong."
Sure, the atmosphere is invigorating. As
soon as that cowbell rings, thousands of stu-
dents clap and cheer with chants of "Go Blue"
without any external instruction. And, of
course, there's the student-led wave that cap-
tures every person sitting in the Big House.
But the recent dwindling attendance paints a
different picture of the game-day experience.
This year, with what Bacon called the
"worst home schedule in Michigan football
history," the Athletic Department sold 8,000
fewer student ticket packages for Michigan
football --a 40 percent decrease from last sea-
son. The prices for each home game remained
about $40 per game, but something caused
this large drop.
- AfterscrappingtheGeneralAdmissiontick-
eting policy last year, Brandon worked with
the Central Student Government to create a
better ticketing option for students. Together,
the Athletic Department and CSG created a

new loyalty-based ticketing program, which
bases ticket group placement by its previous
attendance record, thus prioritizing the most
loyal fans.
Though students have voiced positive
reviews of the new program after several
home games, the process of resolving the
issues between the Athletic Department and
the studentbody is still underway.
In a meeting with CSG in April, Brandon
expressed little concern for the prices of stu-
dent tickets. When asked how students who
can't afford the $40-per-game fee can still
attend games, he suggested the common prac-
tice of buying a season ticket holder's ticket off
of them for the game.
Despite consistent questioning at the meet-
ing, Brandon told CSG he was thankful for
their collaboration.
"We're not perfect, but our intentions are
good," Brandon said in April.
For the football game against Miami Uni-
versity Sept. 13, 102,824 fans attended the
game. Though it upheld the University's long-
standing streak of holding over 100,000 fans,
the crowd fell well below a typical football
game day. The next weekend's game versus
Utah drew 103,890.
Bacon said the biggest issue is not the short-
age of fans - since the decreased attendance

was expected due to what was expected to be
an underwhelming game - but of what the
implications of Athletic Department policies
will have in the future. As ticket prices rise
and home schedules become less desirable, the
outcome for the future may not be as promis-
ing.
"(The Athletic Department) needs to finally
realize that we can't charge steakhouse prices
for fast food schedules," Bacon said. "The big-
ger issue is not just this season or next season,
but what happens in 20 years when your stu-
dent tickets have basically cut in half - the
number of student holders. If you're not a
happy 20 year old with the department, you're
not going to be a happy 40 year old who's going
to want to buy a very expensive sky box. So,
that's what the real problem is: they're killing
the future with the present." {
From Brown to Blue
As Schlissel takes the reins of the Universi-
ty and its Athletic Department, his experience
with athletics comes from a much smaller
venue.
Before Schlissel became Brown's provost, a
project aimed to cut funding from their ath-
letics program began. Under former Brown
University President Ruth J. Simmons, who

visited the University Sept. S for Schlissel's
inauguration, Brown administrators created
an Athletics Review Committee to assess the
role athletics played on campus, along with
what areas of the program to cut due to dwin-
dling funding.
Athletics was the focus of one of 12 groups
formed to assess how to increase Brown's
revenues and cut its expenditures. With the
overall goal of saving $60 million after the
2008, the athletics committee contributed $1
million worth of savings toward that sum. Th
subcommittee cut this goal to $300,000 after
experiencing difficulty in decreasing the pro-
gram's expenditures by that much.
Instead, the athletics subcommittee creat-
ed a plan to over time provide a larger budget
to some athletic unitsby cutting several teams
and programs offered within the department.
Though creating plan came with many
hurdles, the subcommittee reiterated Brown's
goal for athletics on campus, the report read.
Margaret Klawunn, Brown's vice president
for campus life and student services, works
closely with Brown's athletic department. In
a statement, Klawunn said the Ivy Leagued'
overall goal is to find that balance between
academics and athletics.
