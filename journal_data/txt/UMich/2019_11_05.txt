City Council passed an affordable 
housing ordinance Monday evening 
that provided incentives for private 
developers to include affordable 
housing units and also passed a 
resolution for Ann Arbor to achieve 
carbon neutrality by the year 2030. 
More than 50 Ann Arbor residents 
packed the seats of Larcom City Hall 
for the first City Council meeting of 
the month.
 The Roosevelt Institute, a 
University of Michigan student 
progressive 
public 
policy 
think 
tank, 
collaborated 
with 
the 
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, D-Ward 3, to draft an 
ordinance incentivizing affordable 
housing. Ackerman noted that other 
policies to foster affordable housing, 
such as rent control and inclusionary 
zoning, are illegal in Michigan. This 

leaves incentives as the only viable 
form of policy the city can use to 
create affordable housing. 
Previously, the city has provided 
market incentives for developers to 
invest in residential housing. The 
goal of these market incentives 
was to ensure that Ann Arbor’s 
new developments were more than 
40 percent residential, but most 
developments in Ann Arbor are 
currently 90 percent residential. 
Ackerman questioned why the city 
continuously incentivizes projects 
that developers are interested in 
financing.
“As of now we highly incentivize 
market rate housing,” Ackerman 
said. “And market rate premium is so 
lucrative that we see it used in every 
downtown development and rarely 
see other premiums used, premiums 
that would incentivize affordable 
housing and energy efficiency.”

To 
the 
public 
eye, 
the 
current 
situation 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
has 
caused 
violent 
protests, 
political 
conflicts 
and the potential for global 
interference. 
Behind 
closed 
doors, the conflict has divided 
families. 
Engineering research fellow 
Leo Tse, who is from Hong 
Kong, told The Daily his father 
no longer speaks to him because 

of their polarizing views on the 
Chinese 
government. 
While 
Tse believes there is a lack of 
human rights protections in 
Hong Kong and is protesting 
against the government, his 
father 
believes 
in 
China’s 
economic success under the 
current system and does not 
approve any interference with 
the country’s policies. These 
differences in beliefs are not 
uncommon 
among 
Chinese 
families, according to Tse.
“Is there a good outcome for 

this?” Tse asked. “I don’t know, 
I really don’t know. But that’s 
the choice (for) a lot of people. 
You know you’re going to piss 
off your parents, but you know 
what to do to make things right 
as well, so you have to do it.”
To try and better the condition 
and rights of those in Hong 
Kong, in September, Tse formed 
the Hong Kong Human Rights 
Concern Group at the University. 
Made up of about 13 students 
and faculty members, this group 
is advocating for civil liberties 

in Hong Kong through various 
initiatives.
“So right now, there are still 
different opinions within the 
group to be fair, but all of us 
agree upon the concept of human 
rights … all of us want to fight 
for it,” Tse said. “There might 
be different political views on 
specific events and incidents, 
but overall, we support human 
rights, 
and 
that’s 
why 
we 
gathered together and are doing 
what we’re doing.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The 
Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs addressed lingering 
questions regarding faculty 
free speech and University 
sexual misconduct policies in 
a meeting on Monday. Topics 
included the University of 
Michigan’s 
new 
umbrella 
policy for addressing sexual 
misconduct across all three 
university 
campuses 
and 
an ongoing issue regarding 
associate 
professor 
John 
Cheney-Lippold’s 
refusal 
to write a recommendation 

letter for a student’s study 
abroad program in Israel last 
year.
The University has moved 
to 
adopt 
a 
new 
sexual 
misconduct 
policy 
which 
applies to all three of the 
University 
campuses. 
This 
new umbrella policy applies 
to all University employees 
and students, as well as third 
parties involved in a sexual 
misconduct 
allegations. 
SACUA 
member 
Christine 
Gerdes said the content of the 
document isn’t much different 
from the original.
“The substance of much 
of what you’ll see (in the 

document) 
isn’t 
all 
that 
different from the substance 
today,” Gerdes said. “But it 
looks a lot different.” 
The new policy clarifies 
previous policies and includes 
a fixed list of definitions 
of 
prohibited 
conduct, 
specifying what to do when 
an 
allegation 
falls 
under 
the jurisdiction of multiple 
misconduct committees. The 
new policy also reevaluates 
the 
list 
of 
responsible 
employees and confidential 
resources 
within 
the 
University. 
The committee addressed 
a 
policy 
issue 
pertaining 

to how employees couldn’t 
appeal against a potential 
suspension. The new umbrella 
policy doesn’t require the 
employee to be notified of a 
future suspension or allow 
for the employee to submit 
a grievance in regards to 
their 
sexual 
misconduct 
case. 
While 
this 
doesn’t 
apply to tenured or clinical 
professors, 
SACUA 
agreed 
all parties should be given 
the opportunity to submit an 
appeal and be able to get their 
affairs in order before getting 
their pay taken away. 

As 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives forges ahead 
with an impeachment inquiry, 
six 
Michigan 
Republicans 
sent a letter to Speaker of the 
House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., 
last Wednesday, claiming the 
inquiry 
violated 
President 
Donald Trump’s legal right to 
due process. However, experts 
claim due process may not 
apply, since the Constitution 
gives the House full control over 
impeachment proceedings.
According to an article in 
the Detroit Free Press, the 
letter complains the House 
impeachment 
process 
bill 
“may not guarantee the ’timely 
release’of 
transcripts 
from 
depositions.” The letter was 
signed by state Reps. Jack 
Bergman of Watersmeet, Bill 
Huizenga 
of 
Zeeland, 
Paul 
Mitchell 
of 
Dryden, 
John 
Moolenaar of Midland, Fred 
Upton of St. Joseph and Tim 
Walberg of Tipton.
The Free Press article said the 
letter does not mention Trump 
by name or the allegations 
against him.

Officials pass resolutions regarding 
carbon neutrality, housing incentives

The Michigan Daily sat down with 
E. Royster Harper, vice president 
for student life at the University 
of Michigan, Friday afternoon to 
discuss the 2020 Presidential Debate 
being hosted by the University, the 
University’s 
sexual 
misconduct 
policy, the transfer student credit 
policy and more. This interview 
has been edited and condensed for 
clarity.
The Michigan Daily: The 
University announced it will be 
hosting a 2020 Presidential Debate 
next October. How can students 
take advantage of this opportunity? 
What potential safety issues does 
the University expect and what 
will the University do to prepare 
for them?
E. Royster Harper: It’s an 
opportunity to engage in the 
democratic process and to really 
think about that. It’s an opportunity 
for us to talk about things that 
normally we wouldn’t talk about. 
I’m excited about the work that 
Central 
Student 
Government 
(has done), they’ve had two town 
halls to really try to get students 
to talk about what their concerns 
are. Of course, some students are

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and 
other lawmakers in the Michigan 
House 
Democratic 
Caucus 
introduced 
the 
Reproductive 
Health Care Act, a plan to revoke 
existing laws which restrict or bar 
access to abortion, last Tuesday.
Abortion 
is 
currently 
legal 
through the first 24 weeks of 
pregnancy in the state of Michigan, 
though there are a number of 
restrictions regarding access to 
abortion that the RHA aims to 
dissolve. Among the legislation 
these lawmakers hope to repeal is 
a 1931 Michigan law prohibiting 
abortion. Since the 1973 Supreme 
Court decision in Roe v. Wade 
became law, which recognizes the 
right to abortion as a constitutional 
right, federal law has trumped this 
state law. However, if Roe v. Wade 
were to be overturned, abortion 
would again be banned statewide. 
Other laws the RHA seeks to 

repeal include those which require 
a 24-hour waiting period after 
requesting an abortion, parental 
consent 
for 
minors 
seeking 
abortions and a ban on private 
insurance 
coverage 
for 
these 
procedures. The act also aims to 
get rid of barriers for state and 
federal funding for reproductive 
health care providers and access to 
medical abortion via telemedicine, 
which allows health care providers 
to consult patients remotely. 
The movement against abortion 
is also active in Michigan, with two 
anti-abortion petitions currently 
circulating. The first, organized by 
anti-abortion group Right to Life of 
Michigan, seeks to ban the dilation 
and evacuation procedure unless 
the pregnant person’s life is at risk. 
The procedure involves dilating 
the cervix and removing the fetus 
with forceps and can result in 
dismemberment of the fetus. The 
second petition, advocated by the 
Michigan 
Heartbeat 
Coalition, 

advocates 
banning 
abortions 
after cardiac activity is detected, 
which can be as early as five-weeks 
gestation. Both petitions seek to 
enact legislation previously vetoed 
by Whitmer.
On Tuesday, Michigan Attorney 
General Dana Nessel issued a 
statement in support of the RHA 
plan.
“Women’s reproductive rights 
and access to quality health care are 
under attack across the country,” 
the statement reads. “Now, more 
than ever, we must take concrete 
steps to ensure the rights of all 
women are protected under the 
law.” 
Some abortion rights activists 
have expressed concern that the 
bills outlined in the RHA, many of 
which would require a two thirds 
majority, are unlikely to pass in a 
Republican controlled legislature. 
Public Policy senior Brianna 
Wells, co-president of the abortion 
rights 
student 
organization 
Students for Choice at the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
supports the RHA but shared 
concerns 
regarding 
its 
longevity.
“I 
think 
it’s 
really 
important to have something 
that will give people the right 
to choose in the case that 
Roe v. Wade is overturned, 
which is probably likely given 
the people on the Supreme 
Court right now,” Wells said. 
“I don’t know how good of a 
chance the bill has of being 
passed, and even if it were 
to be passed, it just worries 
me that the next time the 
legislature is unfriendly to 
something like this it could 
just be gutted. So, while I 
totally support the bill(s), I 
think that eventually I would 
like to see something more 
permanent put into place, like 
a constitutional amendment 
to Michigan’s constitution or 
something like that.”
In a press conference on 
Tuesday, Whitmer addressed 
this 
concern, 
alluding 
to 
allegations 
of 
illegal 

gerrymandering, but maintained 
that the plan was nonetheless 
important. 
“We are all acutely aware of how 
gerrymandered this legislature is 
and that it’s an uphill battle, but 
it doesn’t mean you don’t fight it,” 
Whitmer said.
Education 
junior 
Justin 
Cadarette, a member of the anti-
abortion 
student 
organization 
Students for Life, opposes any 
change 
to 
the 
current 
laws 
restricting access to abortion in 
Michigan. 
“All of those laws that are 
currently in place are really good 
for making sure if a woman does 
really feels like she needs to have 
an abortion … it makes sure she 
has all the time possible and all the 
information necessary to really 
make a super informed decision 
and very consciously deal with the 
consequences if she does carry out 
the abortion,” Cadarette said. 
He highlighted parental consent 
as one important requirement that 
should not change.
“Especially 
with 
minors, 
definitely their parents need to 
know what’s going on with their 
lives,” Cadarette said. “You need 
to get parental consent to go to the 
dentist, go to the doctor, even to get 
ibuprofen from your high school. 
So definitely parents should know 
that their child wants to get a really 
serious medical procedure done 
that could have potentially bad 
consequences.”
Wells, on the other hand, felt 
repealing laws such as the 24-hour 
waiting period sends an important 
message about bodily autonomy.
“I think that, other than (the 
waiting period) just being an 
unnecessary barrier to people 
trying to seek an abortion, I think 
(repealing) it sends the message 
that we trust individuals enough 
to make decisions about their own 
bodies,” Wells said. “We don’t have 
to put this waiting period on it 
because I think that assumes that if 
you get people to think about it long 
enough, they won’t want to have an 
abortion anymore, and I think that’s 
really condescending.”

Lawmakers introduce bill to repeal laws restricting access to abortion

ANGELINA LITTLE
Daily Staff Reporter 


concerned about issues of safety, 
physical safety and psychological 
safety. So, we’re going to work 
with students around there. And 
then the Ginsberg Center has been 
working since the last midterm 
elections to get students registered 
to vote and to think about what it 
means to be a part of a democracy. 
They’re going to lead out their 
efforts. We’re trying to think about 
what the academic offerings might 
be. I’m hoping when the media is 
just walking down the street every 
student they interview is really 
spot on and will really showcase 
the University well and how smart 
and engaged our students are.
TMD: How do you think 
the debate will affect political 
discourse on campus, and how 
will the University work to make 
sure that this discourse does not 
harm certain members of the 
community?
Harper: I know that many of 
the academic units are thinking 
about hosting teach-ins and teach-
outs, where we can strengthen our 
skills around debate and dialogue. 
So, I think there will be some 
investment in skill development 
in classes and in teach-outs and 
teach-ins. I think student orgs will 
also do some of that work. We’re 
just going to have to practice that 
you don’t get good at talking to 
people whose point of view might 
be different than yours without 
practicing it. … The other thing is, 
if we stay curious, if we could start 
practicing being curious about 
how other people think about an 
issue, that will allow us all to grow 
and develop. It is when I think I 
know everything about everything 
that I’m really limited. … The 
other thing that there has been 
conversations about is creating a 
repository. I don’t know if it’s going 
to be a website or what, that has 
books and articles that you can 
read that represent multiple points 
of views. 
TMD: What potential safety 
issues, whether physical safety 
or 
psychological 
safety, 
does 
the University foresee with this 
debate, and what preparation is 
the University planning to do to 
counter those possibilities?
Harper: 
With 
respect 
to 
physical safety, we have a fabulous 
Department 
of 
Public 
Safety 
and Security, so I think that they 
will do enormous work around 
us physically being safe as a 
community. Psychologically, places 
like CAPS, places like MESA and 
Trotter, many of the organizations 
that marginalized communities are 
a part of will create opportunities 
for students to be together and to 

have a sense of being in community. 
Because I think psychological 
safety comes from a sense of being 
in community. I also think that 
our students will rally around each 
other, so I think students will do 
their own work. Then collectively, 
student orgs and the University 
and service organizations will 
think about what we need to make 
sure that students are actually 
safe and feeling like they are part 
of the community. We’ll start that 
work really, really early. We’ll 
actually start towards the end of 
this spring, some of the work in 
the summer, and then certainly 
when school first starts. … So, this 
is work we’re going to have to do 
together, because it’s not possible 
for the University separate from all 
of us who make up the University 
to provide for your psychological 
safety, because I don’t know what 
that means for you. So, we’re going 
to have to talk about, “OK, for you 
to feel safe, what is it (that) you’re 
needing?” and that might be very 
different than what I need.
TMD: 
Two 
University 
of 
Michigan reports (one from DPSS 
and the other a campus climate 
survey) had conflicting trends 
on sexual assault on campus. 
What do you think explains the 
divergence? What do you hope the 
University can do to lower rates of 
sexual misconduct and increase 
reporting?
Harper: I think reporting, 
telling someone, getting support 
is critical for all members of our 
community. I think the prevalence 
of sexual assault and harassment is 
too high. DPSS reports the sexual 
misconduct data in terms of (the) 
Clery (Act), and so the law requires 
that universities make known that 
level in the community. And then 
there’s the other data set that you’re 
referring to from the Association 
of American Universities. These 
are two different surveys for 
two different purposes that two 
different or even some overlapping 
students might have responded 
to. One’s reporting to the police 
for purposes of the Clery Act, and 
the other one is a national survey 
that had about a 16 or 17 percent 
response rate. Students could 
choose to participate in the survey 
or not. … So, the differences in 
the responses simply speak to the 
complexity of the issue, the nature 
of the survey, and who fills them 
out. … I think what’s important 
for us is that it’s too much, too 
often and unacceptable in our 
community, and we have just be 
vigilant about making sure that 
everybody has an opportunity to 
be safe here, physically safe here, 
which then also has implications 
for being psychologically safe here.
TMD: What kind of takeaways 
do you have from these two 

reports? Given these takeaways, 
what do you think the University 
can do to lower rates of sexual 
assault and increase reporting?
Harper: I think we have to 
keep educating, and right now, 
one of the things the University is 
doing is we have a draft of a sexual 
misconduct policy that’s out there, 
and we’re going around meeting 
with students and student orgs to 
get their reactions, their advice. … 
I think students have to continue 
to take ownership of this issue on 
our campus, so I think we do have 
to watch out for each other in that 
way. Again, one of the things I’ve 
been thinking a lot about, I know 
some of this is just a function of 
retiring and looking back, but many 
of the problems that we have on our 
campus that are important to solve, 
the University alone can’t do very 
much. But if we see ourselves as 
the University, then we can do a lot. 
So, students can intervene when 
they see something, we can make 
sure that there’s a policy in place, 
that the policy is followed, that 
students can trust the University 
and feel like something will happen 
when they report. Because the 
University is seldom in the space 
where the assault and harassment 
are happening. So, we can educate, 
we 
can 
make 
sure 
students 
understand what the reporting is, 
who to go to. We can make sure 
that when a student does disclose, 
they get support. We can believe 
students when they say they’ve 
been harmed. We can put in place 
additional resources to support 
students and also the support we 
provide for the accused. And so, we 
can do all of those things, and there 
are things that students can do, and 
then there’s of course stuff that our 
public safety and criminal justice 
system can do. If we’re to eradicate 
sexual assault on our campus, it is 
going to take a collective.
TMD: Could you speak to 
the 
implementation 
of 
cross-
examination 
within 
the 
University’s sexual misconduct 
resolution process? The University 
has said that this policy was put in 
place for concerns of accessibility 
and equity, and concerns that 
perhaps one of the parties would 
bring in a lawyer, which some 
students might not be able to 
afford. I’ve heard from both people 
who support cross-examination 
in University sexual assault cases 
and those who don’t that if the 
University were forced to have 
cross-examination and processes, 
that it should allow for a third party 
to question the other, and that if 
the student couldn’t pay for it, the 
University should pay for it. 

Ackerman, 
a 
proponent 
of 
affordable housing during his 
previous tenure as Ann Arbor’s 
Planning Commissioner, promoted 
the 
ordinance 
as 
necessary 
legislation due to the stark shift in 
rezoning laws and large hikes rent 
prices.
“We are in the midst of an 
affordable 
housing 
crisis,” 
Ackerman said. “Our neighbors 
are getting priced out of our 
community, and getting priced 
out of our community faster every 
year. Our zoning code, the laws that 
govern what gets built where serves 
to worsen this crisis… Many of 
these changes have been good… but 
most of this new construction has 
been expensive, expensive to build 
and expensive to rent. Now 10 years 
later, rent is rising 16 percent year 
over year. We need to take action to 
address rents downtown.”
The newly introduced ordinance 
would 
incentivize 
developers 
to 
build 
affordable 
housing, 
prioritizing renters who make 
less than 60 percent of the city’s 
median income. The ordinance 
would appeal to developers by 
trading their height limits zoning 
requirements and slashing excess 
parking requirements for increased 
affordable housing inclusion. The 
first two developments to sign on 
would only need to allot 9 to 12 
percent of the units as affordable 
housing, 
while 
the 
following 
developments 
would 
need 
to 

designate 15 to 30 percent of their 
units as affordable housing.
Councilmember Ali Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 5, said adding 15 to 30 
percent of affordable housing units 
in order to address the housing 
crisis is a small price to pay for the 
growing classism in Ann Arbor. 
“I am highly concerned with the 
economic segregation that we have 
in our downtown area,” Ramlawi 
said. “It’s classism and economic 
segregation whether it’s on purpose 
or not, it’s just the reality. So this 
will will help provide more housing 
opportunities for those on the 
lower end of the economic income 
spectrum. Again it’s not a silver 
bullet, it’s not going to take care 
of the issues by itself but I think 
it would be irresponsible not to 
support this in light of concerns that 
our community has on affordable 
housing.”
The council also addressed 
a resolution for Ann Arbor to 
achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. 
The 
resolution 
was 
approved 
unanimously 
and 
met 
with 
applause from the crowd. The 
council also voted unanimously to 
push the deadline to achieve carbon 
neutrality up from 2035 to 2030. 
Initially, some members were 
reluctant to pass the resolution due 
to it’s highly ambitious nature. 
Ramlawi said while he was in 
support of the resolution, he wanted 
to urge the council to consider how 
making false promises could be 
detrimental to their credibility as 
elected officials.
“We can pass these ambitious 
resolutions and these goals, and I 

do support them. But I also like to 
throw some caution in the wind. 
There is issues that we currently 
have, and all you’ve got is your 
word in this life,” Ramlawi said. 
“And we’re never going to hit these 
targets the way we are moving on 
these other issues.”
On 
a 
similar 
note, 
Councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm, 
I-Ward 2, cautioned that the price 
of such an expedited climate plan 
would be felt fiscally among Ann 
Arbor residents.
“I’ll be supporting this tonight 
but with the concern of where 
this may be headed in terms of the 
resources required and the related 
impacts on other priorities,” Lumm 
said. “I don’t think we should try to 
solve global warming on the backs 
of our Ann Arbor tax payers.”
Other 
councilmembers 
remained 
positive 
about 
the 
carbon 
neutrality 
resolution. 
Councilmember Kathy Griswold, 
D-Ward 2, said she felt reinvigorated 
by the passing of the resolution and 
urged residents to use social media 
to share their suggestions with the 
council.
“I am really optimistic about 
this,” Griswold said. “But also want 
to compare this more to putting a 
man on the moon. And one of the 
things we didn’t have back then 
was social media. And we need 
to realize that… if we’re going to 
be successful we’ve got to come 
together and we’ve got to tell the 
people out there ‘use social media 
to share your ideas with us so we 
can be successful.” 

Background on Hong Kong 
protests
Conflicts sparked in China 
after Hong Kong citizen Chan 
Tong-kai murdered his girlfriend 
Poon Hui-wing in February 
2018 while the couple was on 
vacation in Taiwan. Though 
Chan was arrested, there was 
no extradition treaty that would 
permit him to return to Taiwan 
to face his murder charges. 
As a result, Carrie Lam, 
Hong Kong’s chief executive, 
proposed 
the 
Fugitive 
Offenders and Mutual Legal 
Assistance in Criminal Matters 
Legislation (Amendment) Bill, 
a 
controversial 
extradition 
bill which would allow Hong 
Kong authorities to detain and 
transfer suspects from countries 
and regions with which it has no 
official extradition agreements. 
These 
territories 
include 
Taiwan, Macau and mainland 
China.
Many were opposed to the 
bill because they believe there 
is a lack of transparency and 
no guarantee that their rights 
would be protected within the 
legal system of mainland China. 
According to a study conducted 
by the University of Hong 
Kong, 66 percent of Hong Kong 
residents surveyed disagree or 
strongly disagree on extraditing 
people from Hong Kong to the 
mainland for trials. 
This dissatisfaction with the 
government 
spurred 
protests 
within Hong Kong, which have 
occurred for 22 weeks thus far. 
They have resulted in violent 
confrontations 
between 
the 
police and the protesters, as 
well as the arrest of over 2,800 
people.
According 
to 
May 
Chan, 

faculty member at the University 
of Michigan’s Medical School, 
seeing the violence unfold in her 
home city is both shocking and 
difficult for her to accept. 
“I 
was 
born 
and 
raised 
(in Hong Kong), so it’s very 
disheartening to see how much 
the entire society, in terms of the 
governing of the city, has really 
deteriorated,” Chan said. “A lot 
of things people never thought 
would happen in Hong Kong are 
happening in Hong Kong, like 
all the police brutality, reports 
of torture by police and also, 
how the government is probably 
trying to cover up a lot of the 
things they’ve done.”
Though 
Lam 
officially 
announced 
that 
she 
would 
withdraw the extradition bill in 
September, protests have moved 
beyond the bill, as protesters 
formed four other demands 
for 
the 
government: 
the 
development of a commission 
of inquiry into alleged police 
brutality, 
retracting 
the 
classification of protestors as 
“rioters,” amnesty for arrested 
protestors and universal suffrage 
for the Legislative Council and 
the chief executive.
Engineering 
senior 
Edgar 
Chung, who moved to Michigan 
from Hong Kong when he was 19 
years old, said it was troubling 
for him to learn about the 
protests and conflicts occurring 
while he was in Ann Arbor this 
summer for research.
“It was really sickening,” 
Chung said. “It was really hard 
for me to just read all the news. 
You got this feeling where all of 
this is happening in Hong Kong, 
but I wasn’t able to do anything 
because I am on the other side of 
the planet.”
Violent protests and police 
brutality
One of the major issues 
expressed by the group members 

has been the police brutality at 
these protests. Police have been 
using batons, rubber bullets, 
pepper spray and even live 
bullets, among other weapons, 
on protesters. Others have also 
complained about the minimal 
and delayed responses of the 
authorities when protesters are 
attacked by civilians. 
According to Chan, the right 
for people to protest in Hong 
Kong has deteriorated overall, 
becoming less and less protected 
as disputes continue. 
“Hong 
Kong 
people 
are 
supposed to have freedom of 
assembly, it is in the constitution, 
but somehow the police are 
not allowing them, basically by 
making it illegal,” Chan said. 
“It’s taking away their freedom 
of assembly.” 
The conflict and violence is 
not one-sided, however. Some 
protesters use weapons of their 
own against police, and others 
who hold resentment towards 
the Chinese government target 
Chinese-affiliated businesses in 
the city. 
On Saturday, for instance, 
protesters 
attacked 
Xinhua 
News Agency in Hong Kong, the 
official press agency of China, 
by throwing petrol bombs and 
attempting to torch the building 
while people were still inside. 
The office’s windows and doors 
were also smashed, and graffiti 
covered the walls.
Chung said this quick and 
violent 
progression 
of 
the 
conflict is worrisome. 
“As the protests escalate and 
then all the police brutality 
escalates, you cannot help but 
think, ’Oh, what would I do if it’s 
my friend or my family being put 
in that situation?’” Chung said.
Chung, Tse and Chan each 
have personal connections with 
people heavily involved in the 
political movement in Hong 

Kong.
Chung’s friend from high 
school, who is currently 21 years 
old, is protesting at the front 
line. He recently got arrested 
for 
possession 
of 
weapons 
when police found a brick in his 
backpack, Chung said. Many of 
Tse’s friends in Hong Kong are 
also supporting the movement 
by putting up political posters, 
which he says is dangerous — 
people get beaten up for doing so.
Furthermore, according to 
Chan, her relative was previously 
at the front line of the conflict 
and is now gathering protective 
gear for those currently at front 
line. Chan said she and her 
family are concerned for her 
safety. 
“It’s scary,” Chan said. “My 
relative lives alone and she’s 
much younger than me, like 10 
years younger than me. Well 
obviously, her family — my 
family — we’re all very worried 
about her, but we also know that 
she’s doing the right thing, so 
we’re all supporting her as much 
as we could.”
Group supports Hong Kong 
Human Rights and Democracy 
Act
The U.S. has also recently 
become involved in the Hong 
Kong conflict. The House of 
Representatives 
passed 
the 
Hong Kong Human Rights and 
Democracy Act Oct. 15 with 
strong 
bipartisan 
support. 
Among 
other 
measures, 
the 
bill would require an annual 
review of Hong Kong by the State 
Department to determine if the 
city is adequately autonomous 
from Beijing. If the autonomous 
status is upheld, then the U.S. 
government will allow Hong 
Kong to receive special trading 
status according to U.S. law. 
Now that the bill is under 
review by the Senate, the group at 
the University has been actively 

lobbying 
Michigan’s 
senators 
to approve the bill. The group 
says they met with Sen. Debbie 
Stabenow last week and are 
meeting with Sen. Gary Peters 
this week to discuss the bill.
They have also collected about 
270 signatures from those on 
campus in support of the bill. 
Chung says the group’s efforts in 
speaking with Michigan senators 
is a crucial step in helping Hong 
Kong.
“One of the reasons why our 
work here is important, despite 
being such a small group, is if we 
were actually able to convince 
the senators to vote yes for the 
bill, a vote is a vote,” Chung 
said. “It could potentially mean 
actually changing the future in 
Hong Kong.” 
According to Chan, the bill 
is crucial because under the 
communist system, government 
officials and police can currently 
act in any way they would like, 
which puts the people of Hong 
Kong in harm’s way. She believes 
the bill would establish a much-
needed system of checks and 
balances in the city. 
Opposers of the bill have 
been calling on the U.S. to stop 
interfering with China’s affairs, 
believing 
that 
its 
previous 
involvement in other nations’ 
internal 
politics 
have 
had 
detrimental effects.
Furthermore, 
according 
to 
Chung, people believe the U.S. 
does not have true intentions 
to better the human rights and 
democratic conditions of Hong 
Kong through this bill. Instead, 
they say the U.S. is just using 
Hong Kong as financial leverage 
against China. 
“A lot of people are saying 
Hong Kong is just being used as 
a pawn, as a bargaining chip, for 
the U.S. to gain some advantage 
in the trade war,” Chung said. 
“But to be fair … so what if we’re 

being used as a pawn? So what 
if the intentions behind it are 
not pure? We don’t really care, 
because it works in our favor.”
Tse says he understands that 
there is always potential for the 
U.S. to take advantage of Hong 
Kong through this bill as it has 
done to other territories in the 
past. However, he sees Hong 
Kong as being different than 
some of these other regions 
because the city is a vital financial 
connection point between China 
and western countries like the 
U.S. 
“Hong Kong’s value is not to 
become a military power,” Tse 
said. “Maybe, it can be, but right 
now, the reason why businessmen 
are on board for all of this bill is 
because Hong Kong’s value is not 
to destroy it; it’s to keep it as a 
neutral zone for business.”
If the group is able to help get 
the government to pass the bill, 
members hope to continue their 
group’s work by educating people 
at the University about the 
political and social environment 
in Hong Kong. One way is 
through screening films and 
documentaries about Hong Kong 
and the experiences of those 
living in the city.
Chung recognizes the work the 
group is pursuing is important. 
However, for him, participating 
in the group is more than just 
achieving immediate solutions.
“It’s because me, as someone 
who was born and raised in 
Hong Kong, who has friends and 
family in Hong Kong, it is kind 
of like a responsibility, it’s kind 
of like a duty,” Chung said. “I’m 
obligated to do something about 
the town that I came from where 
maybe where my future would 
be, where my kids, my friends 
and family would be. And you 
know we would not have a future 
in Hong Kong if Hong Kong does 
not have democracy.”

Other grievances with the 
policy included inconsistency 
between 
the 
timelines 
for 
employees and students when 
reviewing 
the 
preliminary 
report of their case, nonspecific 
language within the report 
and 
employees’ 
inability 
to appeal to the Office of 
Institutional Equities. SACUA 
chair Joy Beatty voiced these 
concerns, wondering aloud if 
employees would be allowed 
the opportunity to challenge a 
suspension.
“What is the rationale for 
not providing an employee 
with 
the 
opportunity 
to 
challenge a suspension without 
pay?” Beatty said. “Why are the 
timelines shorter for employees 
than they are for students?”
Cheney-Lippold also spoke 
at the meeting to discuss the 
University’s response to his 

decision to rescind a study 
abroad recommendation letter 
in 2018. Cheney-Lippold said he 
rescinded the letter because of 
his participation in an academic 
boycott of Israel organized 
by Palastenian activists. In 
response to the incident, the 
University moved to take away 
Cheney-Lippold’s 
sabbatical, 
freeze his pay and threatened 
to potentially dismiss him. 
Cheney-Lippold asked to meet 
with SACUA to discuss faculty 
political freedom.
“The Dean’s office seemed 
to stop caring about faculty 
wellness 
at 
all,” 
Cheney-
Lippold said. “I believe my 
case raises specific concerns 
regarding faculty academic and 
political freedom.”
Senate Assembly Member, 
Sara Ahbel-Rappe, a professor 
in 
the 
classical 
studies 
department, 
pushed 
back 
against 
Cheney-Lippold’s 
decision to decline to write 
the 
recommendation 
letter, 

referencing 
discrimination 
within American institutions. 
She said the fact that Cheney-
Lippold isn’t boycotting the 
United 
States 
is 
a 
double 
standard. 
“Black 
people 
are 
shot 
everyday 
because 
they’re 
Black. I find it surprising when 
you say that you won’t write 
a letter for anybody going to 
Israel, and you would write 
one for someone in America,” 
Ahbel-Rappe said.
The 
SACUA 
committee 
agreed 
that 
their 
original 
statement 
regarding 
the 
case was rushed and didn’t 
represent the true beliefs of 
SACUA 
members. 
Multiple 
committee members mentioned 
that Cheney-Lippold’s case was 
worrying because it showed 
the relative powerlessness of 
the faculty senate. Instead of 
having a say in the proceedings, 
SACUA’s statement was used 
to bolster the position of the 
University administration.

Demanding a fight against systemic exploitation

Losing hope for Iran’s denuclearization

A 

common 
theme 
that 
has come up during 
my Latinx Leadership 
Program 
meetings 
is that people in our 
community 
have 
been 
silenced 
and 
marginalized for far 
too long. The system 
was not built for us 
and has not done 
nearly 
enough 
to 
include us, so I have 
been 
emphasizing 
that we have to work 
on 
breaking 
our 
silence in order to renovate the 
system into one that serves us. 
We have to act out, get selfish 
and actually be the ones to put 
ourselves over the privileged 
for a change. Have you ever 
known what that feels like? 
Have you ever had to engage 
and 
challenge 
bureaucratic 
systems just so they serve you 
and meet your needs? Whether 
you realize it or not, we are 
all facing the inequity and 
degradation that come at the 
hands of corporate interests 
preventing us from being able 
to adopt sustainable practices 
into our daily lifestyles.
All of us, whether or not 
we belong to a distinguished 
ethnic 
group, 
experience 
discrimination 
every 
day 
simply due to the strain of 
money. Our lives have become 
dictated 
by 
money, 
and 
corporations continue to make 
it harder for us to earn and keep 
it for ourselves. We are forced 
by the system to overpay for 
necessities and are punished 
when we don’t have enough 
of the money it takes from us. 
As an example, rising costs 
of rent and health care have 
been contributing to growing 
financial insecurity in a third 
of 
middle 
class 
American 
families, thousands of which 
are criminalized because of 
the money they owe back. In 
one way or another, people are 
burdened by the fact that they 
have to pay and it is especially 
alarming when these burdens 
affect our needs.
With 
a 
looming 
climate 
catastrophe in our lifetimes, it 
is undeniable that sustainable 
practices 
have 
become 
a 
necessity. And yet, not only 
are corporations themselves 
contributing to the acceleration 
of that catastrophe through 
unsustainable 
practices, 
but they are also preventing 
people from being able to 
mitigate catastrophic effects 
by limiting what we are able 
to buy. Several corporations 
have made it harder for people 

to do their part, whether 
that be investing in clean 
energy, adopting sustainable 
food practices or 
taking part in land 
preservation.
For 
instance, 
DTE 
Energy 
has 
formed 
a 
program 
called 
MIGreenPower 
in 
an 
effort 
to 
more 
cleanly 
source energy. The 
program 
allows 
customers to enroll 
in a service that provides 
a portion of their energy 
from renewable sources and 
a portion of their energy 
from nonrenewable sources. 
Conveniently, 
customers 
have the option of making a 
percentage of their energy 
bill from renewable sources, 
but the catch is that it costs 
more to do so. In this way, 
this program is completely 
counterproductive and flawed.

If the average household 
in Michigan uses about 750 
kilowatt-hours of energy per 
month and chose to convert 
about 58 percent of their 
monthly bill to renewable 
energy, 
this 
would 
add 
approximately $11 onto their 
average monthly bill. While 
this is arguably a modest price 
increase, this alone creates 
an environmental benefit of 
reducing only about half the 
amount of greenhouse gases 
from one car and planting 
about 74 trees. One can argue 
this is a substantial step 
towards 
the 
improvement 
of 
environmental 
quality, 
but we all know that these 
reductions are not enough to 
have the effect necessary to 
save our planet. In fact, even 
if the average household in 
Michigan were to convert 
100 percent of their monthly 
bill to renewable energy, the 
resulting beneficial effects on 
the environment would still 
not be enough to solve the 
global climate issue. While it’s 
not entirely up to DTE Energy 
to be responsible for saving 

our planet by committing 
to 
accessible 
sustainable 
practices, I know that the 
effects of their initiatives 
would be that much more far-
reaching if they eliminated 
the financial burden they 
pose.
Similarly, 
some 
organic 
food 
companies 
have 
demonstrated 
their 
commitment 
toward 
sustainable 
practices 
and 
products 
by 
setting 
high 
standards, but without the 
understanding that collective 
sustainability is only possible 
if it can be implementable 
and accessible. What if I 
wanted 
to 
do 
something 
better for the environment 
but couldn’t afford to? Is it 
my fault for not being able to 
adopt green practices with 
my low-income budget? How 
am I supposed to care for 
my family and think about 
humanity’s future when I 
don’t make enough money 
to do both? These are the 
questions that DTE Energy 
and other corporations are 
not asking themselves.
From the perspective of 
a marginalized community 
member, we are often thought 
to be incapable or undeserving 
of an opportunity to challenge 
our authorities. Instead, we 
are expected to be content 
with those who claim to 
serve us, but this is not the 
case. We know we deserve 
the chance to rise to the 
challenges our system places 
in front of us and we should 
not 
be 
marginalized 
as 
communities any longer. From 
our perspective as people 
challenged by the capitalist 
system that values money over 
our and the environment’s 
well-being, we have to know 
that we deserve better from 
our society. Corporations feed 
off of our susceptibility to the 
comfort of convenience and 
desire for laid-back lifestyles, 
but you have to know that you 
are capable of achieving more 
and you are only held back by 
those you place in power who 
limit you. We should not be 
limited to what we can and 
can’t do because of money any 
longer. We need to fight today 
because in the end, when 
we still have needs that are 
not met after all the system 
offers us, not only has the 
system failed us but we have 
also failed ourselves for not 
demanding more from it.

A

t the Bushehr nuclear 
power plant in Iran, 
all activity is closely 
monitored. Twenty-four-hour 
surveillance of the plant is one 
of the conditions of the 2015 
Iran nuclear agreement, or the 
Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
Action. Regular inspections 
and inspectors having daily 
access 
to 
the 
plant 
from 
the United Nations and the 
International Atomic Energy 
Agency are also part of the 
conditions to verify that Iran 
is in compliance with terms 
to have a peaceful nuclear 
program.
But maybe not for long. On 
Oct. 16, Iran announced that it 
would be turning back on some 
of the commitments outlined in 
the JCPOA by further limiting 
inspectors’ access to some of its 
nuclear facilities. While some 
have suggested that the Middle 
Eastern country’s focus on 
nuclear development indicates 
Iran’s desire to successfully 
construct a nuclear weapon, 
Iranian authorities have stated 
that the goal of these plants is 
to strengthen the economy. The 
Atomic Energy Organization of 
Iran argues that nuclear plants 
like Bushehr “will provide 
between 8 and 10 percent of 
the country’s electricity after 
these plants come online.”
When 
the 
JCPOA 
was 
finalized 
in 
2015, 
those 
who 
debated 
its 
potential 
ramifications could not have 
imagined the world’s current 
state of affairs. Some policy 
experts 
speculated 
about 
the potential violations to 
the 
deal’s 
standards, 
but 
it would be news to me if 
anybody would have guessed 
that the United States, one of 
the key players in the deal’s 
construction, 
would 
have 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
deal 
within the three years of its 
implementation. 
The 
JCPOA 
provides 
the 
framework 
for 
Iran’s 
nuclear 
activities, 
setting 
internationally 
agreed-upon 
levels of uranium enrichment 
and 
mandating 
routine 

inspections from the U.N. 
and the IAEA. In exchange 
for 
accepting 
these 
limits 
on 
its 
nuclear 
activities, 
proponents of the deal argued 
Iran 
would 
benefit 
from 
lessened sanctions from the 
United States and European 
countries. President Barack 
Obama’s decision to push for 
the JCPOA was likely based 
on his view at the time that 
Iran would almost certainly 
attempt 
to 
nuclearize 
in 
the near future. With this 
in mind, the White House 
maintained the position that 
the only clear strategic paths 
for the United States were to 
sanction Iran, declare war on 
Iran or negotiate with Tehran 
about giving up its dreams of a 
nuclear weapon. 

At first, it seems easy to 
point fingers at Iran for what 
looks like a clear violation 
of the terms of the deal. 
And Iran’s violations of the 
agreement terms are nothing 
new. Shortly after the deal 
went into effect, Tehran faced 
international 
condemnation 
for 
refusing 
to 
formally 
disclose 
certain 
nuclear 
facilities to the IAEA. Since 
President Trump’s imposition 
of strict economic sanctions, 
Iran has used more advanced 
centrifuges 
and 
enriched 
larger quantities of uranium 
than was agreed upon. But 
it’s harder now to blame 
Iran for refusing to uphold 
commitments; 
the 
United 
States, after all, has formally 
withdrawn from the deal and 
has reimposed sanctions on 
Iran. The European Union 

has been accused of reneging 
on its part of the deal as well; 
Iran has argued that countries 
such as France and the U.K. 
have not improved their trade 
ties in accordance with the 
deal. The United States also 
has thousands of its own 
nuclear weapons, so why the 
desperate 
push 
for 
Iran’s 
compliance? 
We can see a compelling 
case made for the nuclear 
deal in Obama’s push for the 
JCPOA. In 2015, deep in the 
hot month of August, then-
President 
Obama 
gave 
a 
powerful speech at American 
University about the JCPOA 
shortly after negotiations with 
Iran concluded. He framed 
the urgent need for a solution 
to nuclear proliferation in the 
Middle East, arguing that “the 
choice we face is ultimately 
between diplomacy or some 
form of war – maybe not 
tomorrow, maybe not three 
months from now, but soon.” 
Arguably, Obama’s statement 
is more true now than it 
was then. Trump’s aversion 
to diplomacy with Iran on 
nuclearization 
might 
have 
dangerous implications – Iran 
has even declared that the 
United States is conducting 
“economic terrorism” on a 
country that is still struggling 
to reboot its economy. 
Like 
much 
of 
Trump’s 
foreign 
policy, 
the 
future 
of U.S. policy towards Iran 
remains 
uncertain. 
All 
relevant parties in the JCPOA’s 
framework – the U.S., the rest 
of the permanent members 
of the U.N. Security Council, 
Germany, Iran and the EU 
– should work together to 
revitalize and/or renegotiate 
the deal. With Trump’s current 
bellicose stance and rhetoric 
towards Iran, further progress 
on the deal is unlikely. Iran 
doesn’t have an incentive to 
comply with the deal if the 
United States can’t comply 
with its side of the bargain.

P

hilosophy, 
health, 
business, 
politics, 
economics, law, music 
— 
no 
matter 
what 
field you are planning 
on entering, artificial 
intelligence is sure to 
have an effect on it. 
Yet, university-level AI 
courses are typically 
restricted to technical 
audiences, making the 
topic inaccessible for 
much of the student 
body. 
For 
example, 
at the University of 
Michigan, you must 
take at least four computer 
science courses before you can 
take “Introduction to Artificial 
Intelligence” or “Introduction 
to Machine Learning.” 
This barrier to entry, among 
others, is keeping out the 
diversity of perspectives that 
AI desperately needs. Already 
we are seeing racially-biased 
facial 
recognition 
systems, 
social media algorithms that 
encourage 
negative, 
primal 
content and increased use of 
autonomous weapons. We need 
leaders that can understand 
AI from a wide range of 
viewpoints — but this doesn’t 
reflect the insulated system we 
have now. Relying on computer 
scientists to gain expertise in 
other fields neglects the value 
and expertise of non-technical 
experts 
and 
underestimates 
the complexity of these issues. 
Computer scientists are not 
often experts in anthropology, 
sociology, philosophy, health 
care, economics or law, but 
often there is an assumption 
that they can become experts 
in little time. This hubris is 
what has allowed Silicon Valley 
to threaten privacy, autonomy 
and 
democracy. 
We 
need 
experts from other fields who 
understand the basics of AI, not 
experts on AI who understand 
bits and pieces of other fields. 
Additionally, many jobs now 
require a basic understanding of 
how AI works, what it’s good for 
and what its risks are. Without 
a good understanding, people 
may make poor decisions, rely 

on AI too much or too little 
and exacerbate existing biases 
— with major consequences. 
Just this week, a 
study found racial 
bias in a health 
care 
algorithm 
sold 
by 
Optum. 
The 
algorithm 
consistently 
underestimated 
the health needs 
of Black patients, 
potentially 
affecting 
millions 
of people. As AI 
enters more and 
more of our lives, we need 
people from a diverse range of 
perspectives who can reason 
about its impacts.

This is why I believe we 
need an AI course for a non-
technical audience. I envision 
an introductory AI class, similar 
to 
introductory 
economics 
or statistics, that teaches the 
basics of AI to students from 
a wide range of majors and 
educational 
backgrounds. 
Creating such a class would 
acknowledge 
our 
changing 
world and prepare students 
for challenges they will face 
in their careers. Additionally, 
it would empower groups who 
are underrepresented in STEM, 
but whose perspectives are 
desperately needed, to access 
AI. Andrew Ng, a leading AI 
researcher and adjunct professor 
at Stanford University, recently 
created an online course called 
“AI for Everyone” that aims 
to teach non-technical people 
the basics of AI. More than 

180,000 students have enrolled 
in it so far, demonstrating 
the appetite for the topic. At 
the University, a similar class 
would be a good match for our 
interdisciplinary 
academic 
environment and could be a 
model for other schools. The 
class could cover the technical 
fundamentals of AI, ethical and 
societal 
considerations, 
case 
studies involving its successes 
and failures and the future of 
AI. This would enable students 
to pursue AI further, whether 
in research or practice, gain 
skills and understanding that 
will be vital to their careers 
and contribute to important 
discussions about AI.
Also, 
by 
limiting 
comprehension 
to 
a 
small, 
relatively exclusive group of 
people, we are missing out on 
potentially 
transformational 
applications of AI. Opening up AI 
could lead to more applications 
in finance, medicine, among 
other multifaceted uses that 
would not be possible if we 
relied on computer scientists 
alone. For example, an art 
collective created a piece with 
AI that sold for over $400,000 
at auction. The University of 
Southern 
California 
Center 
for Artificial Intelligence in 
Society is using AI in areas such 
as homelessness and suicide 
prevention. AI is also assisting 
in the fight against climate 
change. Who knows what could 
be dreamt up by a generation of 
students with a new, immensely 
powerful tool?
We need an AI course for 
people 
of 
all 
backgrounds 
because the impacts of AI 
extend far beyond computer 
science. We have already seen 
the consequences of keeping this 
field closed off, and as the power 
of AI grows, so does the need 
for leaders who understand it. 
By making AI more accessible, 
we can mitigate its risks and 
enable 
innovative, 
beneficial 
applications, helping to ensure a 
better future for us all.

You walk into a bar on Halloween dressed 
as Margot Robbie dressed as Sharon Tate from 
Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in 
Hollywood.” You spent 20 dollars and six hours 
trying to put on fake eyelashes and the bar is empty. 
The guy dressed as Austin Powers you flirted with 
at Rick’s on Tuesday isn’t there, your roommates 
who couldn’t decide on a trio costume that wasn’t 
“Mamma Mia” or the Kardashians aren’t there. 
The only other person there is a girl approximately 
your height also in a black turtleneck, also in an 
a-line, white, mini skirt, also in white go-go boots, 
also rocking the same flawless, golden locks. Like 
Carrie Bradshaw, you couldn’t help but wonder, 
is that girl you? Or is she, perhaps, a Kafka-esque 
manifestation of your own sense of self? She looks 
at you, you look at her, and in the pornographic 
version of this story, you two furiously make out. 
But this isn’t the pornographic version of this story, 
so you look at each other for an extra second or two 
before she wonders aloud: Are you also Sharon 
Tate? You blink your fake eyelashes a little too 
forcefully in an enthusiastic nod. She drags you to 
the dance floor where her friends have assembled 
as the entire cast of the movie you are both dressed 
up as. So much for trying to be original. 
Your friends enter the bar dressed as a 
combination of Selena Gomez, Avril Lavigne and a 
sexual fantasy. The same guy flirts with all of you. 
He is dressed as nothing. Not the concept, which 
would’ve been more interesting. I guess you could 
say he is dressed as Jared from Saginaw who is a 
senior studying economics. Or you could say he is 
dressed as nothing. 
You pose for too many pictures and try to suck 
in your gut so much that you almost give yourself 
a stomach aneurysm, if that’s even a thing. You 
drink shots of whiskey and chase them with pickle 
juice because it makes you feel mature. You think 
about the last three Halloweens when you were 
Cher Horowitz and Eleven and Gilda Radner. You 

decide, collectively, that this place sucks. You then 
go to a suckier place, perhaps the suckiest place. 
You arrive and see the line, hell no. You know 
it’s not worth the walking pneumonia, you wish 
you stayed at the other bar or never went out in 
the first place. Your friend reminds you that she 
is in Greek life, so the four of you waltz up to the 
masked bouncer like the cast of “The Bling Ring.” 
Without a singular qualm, your friend whispers 
in slow motion a very specific fruit or vegetable or 
brand of Tequila. This is the password. You enter 
the establishment feeling like a king. 
The feeling of superiority melts away before it 
has a chance to grow into confidence. Every boy 
is dressed as a character from “Peaky Blinders,” 
while his female counterpart is a devil or an angel 
or Ashley O. 
You never pay for a drink. You pretend to 
have seen “Peaky Blinders.” You try on different 
personalities like costumes, it is Halloween after 
all. You wonder if that boy dressed as Austin 
Powers will be there. He is. He doesn’t remember 
you. You wonder about all the people you don’t 
remember but then you remember that you can’t 
remember. 
You talk to a boy or, rather, he talks to you. He 
tells you about his screenplay. You wonder if he 
will read this column and know who he is. You 
second guess writing this line because it could 
come off weird but you promise it’s not weird. Yet, 
saying that it’s not weird makes it feel like it really 
is weird. You leave it in unless your editor decides 
to take it out. 
He asks for your number and the only digits that 
come to mind are 867-5309. You give him your real 
number and hope that his fake mustache is in fact 
fake. 
You leave with one out of three of the friends you 
came in with. You get pizza for the third time in 72 
hours. Your friend gets two slices and a date. You 
get a pie and a drunken text. 
You get home, you rip off the 20 dollar, six hour, 
fake eyelashes in less than a second. You fall asleep 
on the couch with your white go-go boots on. It is 
your last Halloween in Ann Arbor.

HUMOR COLUMN

Like the sudden reminder of a like on an old 
Facebook picture, past versions of ourselves are 
often the hardest things to grapple with. Look in the 
mirror for too long, and you’ll start looking strangely, 
endlessly flawed. How much of that image is what we 
have created ourselves, and how much is due to the 
double binds society thrusts upon us?
Saeed Jones’s “How We Fight For Our Lives: 
A Memoir” takes an unflinching look back at a 
past version of himself, and in doing so 
examines the degrading, paradoxical 
situations thrust upon gay Black men. 
Jones, at an all-too-young age, was shown 
the contrast between who he wanted to be 
and what society had predetermined he 
would be:
“Being Black can get you killed.
Being gay can get you killed.
Being a Black gay boy is a death wish.”
From the start, Jones writes his 
youth as being defined by being pulled in 
multiple directions. A pull between his 
Buddhist, single-mother home in Texas 
and summers spent with his Christian 
grandmother in Memphis. Between his bookish 
nature and society’s expectations for Black men. 
Between the homophobia of his grandmother, the 
willful ignorance of his mother and his true sexuality. 
Later, he’s pulled between his home and mother 
in Texas, an expensive education in New York City 
and a debate scholarship in Kentucky. Between being 
asked to simultaneously fulfill the role of a child, 
father and husband. And finally, between the life he’s 
built for himself and family tragedies that interrupt 
that growth.
“How We Fight For Our Lives” asks essential 
questions about what happens when people are 
ground down on opposite sides. Does their edge 
become pliable like clay, or sharp as a knife? Jones is 
uniquely unafraid to ask hard questions about who 
those people are who are grinding them down. If it’s 
the ones they hate, are they necessarily evil? What if 

it’s the ones they love?
As with other queer youth, he’s caught between 
who he is and who his family wants him to be. Jones’s 
ability to tackle these problematic issues is his most 
valuable asset. Even in trauma, like when his mother 
finds explicit instant messenger chats between him 
and older men, he has the understanding to ask how 
he’s affected his family.
As he works on updated versions of himself, Jones 
must constantly re-sync that self with his family. 
Calling back home from college is a reminder of the 

Saeed Jones his mother knows. The memoir’s third 
act is the final echo of this process: Tragedy strikes his 
family, and Jones must re-evaluate his professional, 
strenuously built life with the one he left behind.
Through his adolescence, Jones learned to 
address trauma by writing and reading poetry. His 
background as a poet lends itself immensely to “How 
We Fight.” Jones’s poetry background seeps into 
every crack he can carve out of the memoir genre. 
The prose is best when it embeds poetic devices 
in what could still be a late-night talk between old 
friends. If it is genuinely conversational prose, it’s 

the well-crafted version of yesterday’s argument you 
perfect in the shower the next day.
Jones’s imagery, phrases or deliberate use of 
particular words stick in your mind. Mark Twain 
describes history as not repeating but rhyming. 
Like his poems, this memoir rhymes similarly by 
repeating devices or odd word choices from previous 
chapters. In a particularly difficult passage about 
sexual assault, previously used diction and syntax 
come back like a ghost to haunt Jones.
Even while recounting the most jarring traumatic 
events, Jones omits no embarrassing or complicating 
details. The disturbing realities of the intersection of 
racism, sexuality, sexual assault and family life are 
laid out bare. Sometimes, one can’t help but re-read 
to confirm a detail was actually acknowledged. The 
reader’s feeling of seeing the genuine, messy reality of 
trauma shows why these themes are best presented 
in memoir form. 
The mood is somehow both contradictory and 
cohesive. Jones has confidence, even while explaining 
his greatest insecurities. He’s understanding of his 
family’s actions while acknowledging the hurt they 
caused him. Many of these complexities could have 
been lost with a less expressive writer.
All these complexities are packed into a rather 
short memoir without feeling rushed. Unlike other 
books attempting to touch on various themes, the 
book in no way overstays its welcome.
Perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that his writing 
tiptoes through contradictions and complications 
in mood and theme, given that Jones is forced to 
tiptoe through these contradictions in his own 
life. Ultimately, “How We Fight For Our Lives” is 
a concise, but a fully fleshed-out exploration of the 
complexities of growing up with the world stacked 
against you. Jones shows queer people can’t just sit 
back and watch their future selves unfold. They must 
fight to create a life for themselves, and then often 
fight for their life itself.

Saeed Jones’s memoir a
poetic, queer reckoning

Emily Dickinson, the notoriously reclusive and 
prolific American poet, goes on hot dates with Death. 
At least, she does in “Dickinson.” 
In “Dickinson,” Emily (Hailee Steinfeld, “The Edge 
of Seventeen”) faces a life of literary obscurity and 
domestic boredom as she grows up in Amherst, Mass.. 
Her father (Toby Huss, “GLOW”) prohibits her from 
publishing her beloved poetry and encourages her to 
remain in his household as a proper lady. Her mother 
(Jane Krakowski, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”) 
would rather have all the chores to herself and see her 
wild and difficult daughter marry as soon as possible. 
Emily has other plans. Determined to become the 
greatest poet who has ever lived, she seeks adventure 
and sets off to break as many rules as she can. She 
publishes a poem against 
her 
father’s 
wishes, 
sneaks 
into 
Amherst 
College 
to 
attend 
the 
male-only 
lectures, 
throws 
extravagant 
opium parties and protests 
the construction of an 
environmentally harmful 
railroad with Henry David 
Thoreau (John Mulaney, 
“Big Mouth”). 
While Emily strives to cross boundaries and create 
change, she still struggles against the overwhelming 
pressure and strict social standards of her New 
England life. Her closest friend and secret lover Sue 
Gilbert (Ella Hunt, “Anna and the Apocalypse”) 
announces her engagement to Emily’s brother Austin 
(Adrian Enscoe, “Seeds”). The news sends Emily into 
a downward spiral and motivate her to fight back 
against the very systems that suppress her. 
“Dickinson,” however, refuses to restrict itself to 
simply retelling the story of Emily’s life. Instead, it 
commits wholeheartedly to the poet’s unconventional 
style and explores her world of creativity with 

anachronistic flair. 
This show isn’t interested in tired period piece 
tropes or pretentious dialogue to make its points. At 
the end of the season’s first episode, Emily runs to 
join Death (Wiz Khalifa, “Bojack Horseman”) in his 
ghostly horse-drawn carriage while “bury a friend” 
by Billie Eilish plays in the background. Despite how 
unconventional it may seem, it makes perfect sense. 
Nothing is off limits for “Dickinson,” and its subject 
material is only improved because of it. 
While the show revels in its outlandish moments 
and off-kilter humor, “Dickinson” still knows that 
its fun comes at a cost. Limited by her gender and 
sexuality, Emily’s attempts at causing mischief in the 
name of poetry are always tinged by her deep sense 
of loneliness and otherness. Constantly referred to as 
“weird,” Emily accepts the label happily to display her 
unique talents, but the separation of her inner world 
and those around her is 
undeniable. Her alienation 
is 
evident 
in 
every 
hallucination 
of 
Death, 
every Mitski song on the 
soundtrack, every moment 
of twerking in a hoop skirt 
and corset. 
“Dickinson” 
understands 
its 
own 
mythology so well that it 
doesn’t feel the need to 
reflexively prove its sincerity. Emily’s legacy speaks 
for itself, and this depiction of her living days doesn’t 
attempt to explain her technical poetic genius. The 
show focuses on the poet’s life as she is not often 
remembered: A brilliant, witty writer who felt true 
devotion to her friends and family, a far cry from the 
hermit persona that has defined her place in history.
Through this new series, Emily Dickinson has 
her own story rewritten without the burden of her 
stuffy, historic reputation. “Dickinson” seamlessly 
constructs a world where Emily can reclaim her own 
narrative and, in its brilliant execution, grants her the 
immortality she deserves.

“The 
Laundromat” 
recounts 
dramatized 
vignettes about the Panama Papers, a 2015 data leak 
that connected hundreds of public figures and elites 
from 200 countries to an obscure Panamanian 
law firm, Mossack Fonseca. After the unexpected 
brilliance of his last project, “High Flying Bird,” 
Steven Soderbergh’s atypical foray into awards 
season is ultimately a well-meaning effort that falls 
flat. 
The director is clearly fond of the small fry, a 
self-proclaimed champion of the underdog. In 
“Laundromat,” he attempts to diverge from his 
known playbook, instead choosing to explain the 
international political scandal from a decidedly 
titanic perspective: The partners of the Panamanian 
law firm held responsible.
Mossack and Fonseca, played by Gary Oldman 
(“Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban”) and 
Antonio Banderas (“Life Itself”) respectively, are 
closer to narrators than characters in the story, 
frequently breaking the fourth wall to address the 
audience and divulge the nuances of their legal 
scheming. As a result, the talent of the two actors is 
largely wasted on stinging exposition and walking 
around through champagne-plied galas and white 
sand beaches. Soderbergh’s dedication to their 
viewpoint is compelling, elongating the single news 
cycle life of the Panama Papers into a measured 
look into their actual misdoings.
Yet, the plot is fragmented by Soderbergh’s 
unconditional adoration of the underdog. In addition 
to several stories about offshore shell companies 
that quietly run funds from bank account to bank 
account, the audience follows a recurring thread 
about an ordinary woman who discovers the Panama 
Papers through her dysfunctional insurance 
company. Ellen Martin, played by Meryl Streep 
(“Mamma Mia”), is the film’s sole everywoman, 

and is certainly noble in her cause to bring down 
the nameless corporations who control her life like 
the puppeteers they are. But eventually, her rigid 
morality feels like a performative ruse compared to 
the rest of the movie. There is something admirable 
about telling a story of corruption through a lens 
of rank, privileged apathy. That would be an 
inherently reflexive movie, immediately forcing 
the viewer to question their own beliefs about the 
politically translucent demons on screen. However, 
Soderbergh cannot resist his own temptations 
to include the layman, and the result is a wasted 
Meryl Streep performance that adds little to the 
film.

The result of Soderbergh’s breadth in perspectives 
is not enlightening, in fact, it’s hardly informative. 
“Laundromat” 
becomes 
lost 
in 
its 
stylistic 
idiosyncrasies and sprawling storylines to the 
point of mundanity. It has all the fingerprints of an 
entertaining movie, but that’s all it ever is. A middle-
school presentation about the Panama Papers 
would have covered the same amount of intellectual 
ground as a product suffused with movie stars, 
elaborate sets and high-level filmmaking. 
“Laundromat” is frequently compared to Adam 
McKay’s “The Big Short.” But the key difference 
between these two trenchant and bitingly smart 
political comedies is clear. I walked away from 
“The Big Short” with an understanding of the 
financial crisis that was half-soundbite and half-
real-understanding. “Laundromat” only provides 
the former, as compact and instantaneous as the 
Panama Papers news cycle itself.

In early 2019 Miranda Lambert moved to New 
York City, secretly married a police officer and got 
some new ink: A wildcard, the queen of hearts, 
on her inner right forearm. Cast as a “queen of 
heartbreak” by the media when her divorce from 
Blake Shelton in 2015 spurred a string of short-
term relationships, Lambert reclaims the narrative 
of her up-and-down love life by embracing it. 
In her latest album Wildcard, she puts life’s 
unpredictability into words against the backdrop 
of her move to the city and sonic exploration. 
Each song sounds different, but full and fun, all 
wildcards themselves.
The first track “White Trash” combats a common 
country music critique right off the bat. Yes, 
Lambert admits, she’s “upgraded from the barbed 
wire” fence for a “nice picket.” And yes, she only 
lives in Tennessee part-time. But that doesn’t mean 
she should lose her country cred. A funky mix of 
banjo and electric 
guitar, 
the 
song 
follows 
Miranda 
through her house, 
documenting 
the 
duct tape and dog 
hair, 
which 
she 
attributes to her 
upbringing. “New 
money, old habits” 
Lambert explains. 
“White 
Trash” 
establishes 
perspective, but “It All Comes Out in the Wash” 
sets the tone of the album. Fun and upbeat, Lambert 
declares herself a clean slate. “You take the sin and 
the men and you throw ‘em all in / And you put that 
sucker on spin,” she advises. With strong backup 
vocals and playful lyrics that address awkward 
incidents, Lambert lets her listeners know that the 
healing process doesn’t always have to be sad and 
lonely.
If “It All Comes Out in the Wash” is the car 
sing-along song for dealing with a break-up, 
then “Bluebird” is the diary entry of the record. 
Dark and determined, Lambert assures herself 
that when the next storm blows through, she’ll 
be able to handle it. “When the house just keeps 
on winning / I’ve got a wildcard up my sleeve,” 
Lambert winks. And, if the world were to stop 
singing, she promises to “keep the bluebird in my 
heart.” For those who don’t know, the Bluebird 
Cafe is a songwriter hangout in Nashville with a 

famous open mic night. With a slow and steady 
pace and lovely lyrics, the “Bluebird” showcases 
just that — Lambert’s talent for songwriting. 
A change in pace, “Locomotive” sounds like 
Lambert just stepped off the train in her new home, 
ready to throw down — “New York City seems 
O.K.” she declares. “Locomotive” is the closest 
thing Wildcard has to a rock song, and it also has 
one of the album’s most clever turns of phrase: “I’m 
sweet tea sippin’ on a front porch, sittin’ / while 
my hubby fries chicken / and I’m pluckin’ these 
strings.” Although this scene doesn’t quite fit in 
with city life, it sets up the following lyrics, “he 
gives me wings.” A play on the food and the joy she 
gets from being with her husband, Lambert’s voice 
soars alongside heavy instrumentation and the 
listener can’t help but feel happy for her.
Smirk-worthy lyrics set to a head-nod inducing 
groove, Lambert praises her band, her fans and 
everything in between in “Pretty Bitchin’.” It’s 
insanely catchy. And, even though it seems like she 
sings “pretty” every other word, it doesn’t get old. 
“Life’s pretty great, life’s pretty weird” she repeats, 
summing up her 
contentment.
However, 
Lambert 
acknowledges 
that her life hasn’t 
always 
been 
so 
great. On “Track 
Record,” 
she 
owns up to having 
a 
“Past 
that’s 
checkered / As the 
floor at the diner of 
Main Street” and chronicles her misadventures in 
love. But as messy as she says it is to be a “heart-
wrecker,” the song doesn’t sound like it. Instead, 
like a sunny Sunday afternoon drive, it’s bubbly 
and laid-back all at once. When Lambert claims “I 
can’t help it / I’m in love with love,” the listener 
can’t help but believe her.
The album’s closer finds Lambert in “Dark Bars,” 
an unexpected retreat into the shadows given all of 
the light in the songs that precede it. “I’m not in 
pain, I’m not on pills” she eases fears, “but I’m still 
hanging out in dark bars.” Despite being in a better 
place, Lambert admits that she can be “reckless” 
and “desperate.” So maybe it does make sense to 
end in melancholy reflection. Both the listener 
and Lambert know better than to think that all 
the storms have ended and that yesterday’s load of 
laundry was the last. But now this queen of hearts 
knows her own, and has an album of exploratory, 
lyrically-sound songs to show for it.

cards in her latest album

Sunday, Oct. 27 witnessed Pokey LaFarge’s 
glorious return to Ann Arbor, headlining The Ark’s 
annual Fall Fundraiser. Described as a “pre-war soul” 
by the event’s Detroit-based MC, DJ Del Villarreal, 
and known to The Daily as our favorite musical time-
traveler, LaFarge was a welcome sight. For those 
unfamiliar, LaFarge, a borderline regular on the Ann 
Arbor music scene, is an artist who carefully walks 
the line between indulgence in nostalgia and new 
experimentation. His music, steeped in the age-old 
foundations of rootsy Americana, mixes dashes of 
jazz, old-time country with bright splashes of French 
and Spanish flair. 
Unsurprisingly, LaFarge put on a fantastic show. 
Equal parts crowd-pleasing, fun and vulnerable, 
the show filled the house and there wasn’t a frown 
in sight. But I have already done my fair share of 
Pokey-centric reviews, write-ups and headlines. 
There is little more to be said about the magical 
musical mastery LaFarge wields on and off stage. In 
fact, aside from a few sneak peeks at his upcoming 
album, LaFarge performed as expected — he’s 
always been a reliable, consistent artist. That’s not 
to say his performance at The Ark wasn’t all parts 
exhilarating and awe-inducing. Rather, what made 
this show worthwhile were the moments in between 
— in between songs, lyrics, people — that reaffirmed 
why Pokey LaFarge remains a beloved favorite both 
in Ann Arbor and around the world. 
Here are a few of these defining “Moments in 
Between:” 

You Gotta Earn It

The lights dim, the crowd took its seats and 
Ann Arbor’s “Honky Tonk Angel” took the stage. 
Polite and well-mannered, the audience waited in 
anticipation, bellies full, the room warm and drowsy 
— but drowsy isn’t in Pokey’s dictionary. “Get up,” 
heaving the crowd to their feet with a command — 
screw angels, it seemed the God of Folk had descended 
from his dusty mountain cabin this evening. The 
crowd stumbled to their feet, joints popping, backs 

cracking. “A pre-show stretch,” LaFarge encouraged; 
a satisfied sigh and a lazy groan answer. Grumbles 
turn to chuckles, “Make us earn it,” a heckler joked —
LaFarge gave nothing away for free. “The Devil Ain’t 
Lazy” opened the show — very subtle, Mr. LaFarge.

Chit-Chat 

The audience clumsily sang along, mistimed 
claps and slurred lyrics in all their glory. A devoted 
fan sang word for word with Pokey — by the third 
song, he threw her a playful, measured look, as if 
in silent acknowledgment of a capable foe, then 
continued playing. He asked us about the Michigan 
mitten — we obliged. “But what about the U.P.?” We 
all questioned, cueing a familiar existential crisis. 
The Lions won and the Giants suck; Pokey LaFarge 
sang “drinking tea from my paper cup;” “Sing Ave 
Maria,” a heckler called out — LaFarge responded in 
disbelief, and challenged his audience to come sing it 
instead. “And a clinking van is a happy van, I always 
say,” LaFarge instructed — and a clinking backpack 
is a happy backpack, I always say, when it comes to 
Friday hangovers. “Hold on, I got it,” LaFarge cried 
resolutely, obliging a song request then forgetting the 
lyrics — once, twice and third time’s the charm as the 
words finally flowed out. 

Drinkin’ Whiskey 

As patrons filed out the doors, the dedicated — 
the old-hats — waited patiently. Chants of “Encore, 
encore” gradually grew in momentum. Half the 
room was empty, doubt crept in — would Pokey really 
leave us hanging, just like that? It was as if we were 
all jilted lovers, taken by surprise, betrayed. Then, 
when hope grew most bleak, LaFarge ambled back 
on stage — only to hop right off. Climbing onto a 
chair and gathering us around like a flock of sheep, 
he strummed his guitar for one last song. “We’re 
drinkin’ whiskey tonight,” the audience danced 
feverishly around him, as if in ritual. Patrons happily 
belted “Drinkin’ whiskey” in bawdy drinking-song 
style. We danced with Pokey, we danced with one 
another: Eyes smiling, teeth flashing — it was a 
moment of pure revelry, unfiltered happiness. Who 
needs whiskey when you got good music?

Last week I waited with bated breath 
for the final star of Halloween’s night sky 
to melt into the morning sun of Nov. 1. Put 
your skeleton decorations away, people. 
The winter solstice fast approaches! 
I may be known amongst friends for 
having a particular proclivity for the 
holiday season, but it’s not just Christmas 
carols and Thanksgiving turkeys that put 
a smile on my face. It’s also definitely not 
the aisles of environmentally unfriendly 
wrapping paper and plastic fall-themed 
wreaths, either. 
There are plenty of drawbacks to the 
most wonderful time of the year. Among the 
upticks in stress and trips home to childhood 
dining 
rooms 
lie 
conversations 
with 
relatives who insist you’re still growing and 
elders who question your career prospects. 
In between these unfortunate details we — 
the college student body — learn to create 
magic within the cracks of campus life. 
This brings me to the holy grail of the 
university holiday season: Friendsgiving. 
How has this unconventional holiday 
become so emblematic of the holiday 
season? Is it the potluck dinner of ramen 
and instant mashed potatoes? Or, perhaps, 
it’s the leftover Halloween candy hiding on 
the top shelf, or a trip to South Quad’s taco 
bar. Maybe it’s literally just wine. 
The beauty of this holiday lies in its 

open-endedness. Its flexibility matches our 
youthful rejection of tradition, but make 
no mistake; its importance does not go 
unnoticed. 
Together, we inhabit Ann Arbor in 
communal states of elongated temporal 
existence, ever-avoiding the concept of 
impending graduation. This holiday season, 
take time to remember this fact not out of 
sadness, but for specified appreciation of 
its uniqueness. 
Look away from your papers and 
flashcards and too-long readings to bask 
in the ease of finding a night for everyone 

to convene in the same place on someone’s 
floor — and apologize to the downstairs 
neighbors for the noise it might cause. 
In this spirit, here are some of the people 
I am thankful for: 
The friend who reads all my Daily 
articles without me telling her I’ve written 
them. 
The friend who works at Starbucks and 
recently brought home an entire carton 
of the Strawberry Refresher concentrate 
because he knows it’s my favorite drink. 
The old roommate who once taped a 
stuffed animal to our dorm-room ceiling 
while I was asleep because she knew it 
would make me laugh in the morning. 
The friend that I met in a sleepy English 
class who texted me her summer address 
last May so we could be old-fashioned pen 
pals. 
The friend who recently told me to think 
of myself as an extra large Mission-line 
flour tortilla, whereas my ex-boyfriend is 
the small store-brand corn alternative. 
The friend who I met while studying at 
a different university, but will Facetime me 
exactly when she knows I need it the most. 
My twin brother, who lives across the 
street from me and convinced me to transfer 
from a school where I was truly unhappy. 
And to everyone else who I continue 
to meet far into my college years. To the 
friends who may be strangers today but 
I might one day call family, all thanks to 
this crazy little microcosm of Southeast 
Michigan.

Only the jerseys

W

hen Michigan’s sea-
son tips off tonight, 
only the Wolverines’ 
jerseys will 
remind you of 
yesteryear.
By now, 
most have 
grown numb 
to the fact that 
John Beilein 
is gone. The 
shock doesn’t 
register nearly 
as much as 
it did only a 
few months ago. But on Tuesday 
night, it will resonate more than 
ever before. The man who spent 
the last decade-plus building 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team into a perennial contender 
walked out the door on a mid-
May morning, following in the 
footsteps of three early roster 
departures.
Despite coming off back-to-
back 30-win seasons for the 
first time in program history, 
the defining elements of Michi-
gan basketball suddenly felt 
unhinged. When Juwan Howard 
was hired, they went out the 
window.
And by no means is that a bad 
thing.
Howard will build his pro-
gram on a completely different 
bedrock than Beilein, who began 
his coaching career as a junior 
varsity high school coach and 
worked his way up the ladder 
to Ann Arbor. His successor, 
however, spent the last two-
and-a-half decades playing and 
coaching at the ladder’s highest 
rung. Naturally, they see the job 
through different lenses.
Take recruiting, for example. 
Beilein never signed a McDon-
ald’s All-American, but that 
didn’t stop him from coaching a 
Monday night game in both April 
of 2013 and 2018. In doing so, his 
program became the gold stan-
dard of developing talent. That 
process started at square one, 
with Beilein’s teams notoriously 
beginning each season with the 
most basic of passing drills.
Howard, on the other hand, 
has employed his NBA pedigree 
in his attempt to shoot for the 
stars. Following his formal intro-
duction at the end of May, he 
extended 13 scholarship offers to 

top-45 prospects over the sum-
mer, per the 247 Sports 2020 
Composite Rankings. Among 
that group was five-star power 
forward Isaiah Todd, who ulti-
mately chose Michigan over 
Kansas, which had been recruit-
ing him since eighth grade.
Todd’s pledge is more than 
a commitment. It’s a seismic 
shift in the Wolverines’ recruit-
ing, which now 
appears eager to 
go toe-to-toe with 
the nation’s top 
programs. Eight 
of the aforemen-
tioned top-45 
recruits have 
already commit-
ted, five of which 
selected Duke, 
Kentucky or 
North Carolina.
While adding Todd doesn’t 
automatically make Michigan 
a one-and-done factory, it sure 
defines exactly who Howard 
wants to be on the recruiting 
trail.
Howard has been as aggres-

sive as any other recruiter in the 
country since his hiring — an 
effort that appears aligned with 
the Wolverines’ anticipated tran-
sition to an NBA-like brand of 
basketball. Last season, Beilein’s 
offense finished 341st in the 
nation in possessions per game. 
In Friday’s exhibition onslaught, 
Michigan’s used every transition 
opportunity to attack the rim or 
create uncontest-
ed jumpers, while 
19 first-half pos-
sessions ended in 
shots off one pass. 
There’ll be grow-
ing pains, particu-
larly with shot 
selection, but that 
type of up-tempo 
offense was previ-
ously absent in 
Ann Arbor.
“If you’re open, I want our 
guys to shoot it,” Howard said 
on Friday. “I don’t want them to 
have a second guess or think the 
game and play like robots. I just 
want them to read the game, read 
time and possession.”

The philosophy led to 31 three-
point attempts — a figure which 
Michigan eclipsed just twice all 
of last season.
“Coach Beilein liked quick 
shots if they were wide open,” 
said junior forward Isaiah Liv-
ers. “Coach Howard likes quick 
shots, but smart quick shots — 
not a contested shot. He wants 
to run. If we get stops, we better 
reward ourselves.
“ … It’s just 
the adjustment 
of you get a steal 
and there’s two 
guys ahead of you, 
you’re like, ‘Ah, 
I’m gonna hold 
off.’ That’s how it 
used to be. Coach 
Howard’s imple-
mented you get up 
to that halfcourt 
and you get to that free throw 
line and then you make your 
decision of if you’re going to 
pull it out or go. ‘Just be a bas-
ketball player,’ that’s what he 
tells us.”
That message is in line with 

Howard’s idea of positionless 
basketball. With multiple play-
ers on the roster athletic enough 
to guard multiple positions, 
there’s room to get creative.
Against Appalachian State, 
the country will get a glimpse of 
what, exactly, that entails. And 
Ann Arbor will get a glimpse 
of what, exactly, hiring a first-
time head coach with no college 
coaching experi-
ence entails.
The transition 
won’t be seam-
less, but early 
returns suggest 
Michigan ath-
letic director 
Warde Manuel 
nailed this hire 
in the wake of 
Beilein’s sudden 
exit. It’s now 
up to the ones who wear the 
unchanged jerseys, not suits, to 
prove it.

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily
The Michigan basketball team is set to unveil its reinvented self Tuesday when it takes on Appalachian State, ushering a new era in which hardly anything is the same.

When Juwan Howard steps on the floor as Michigan’s coach, nothing will be the same as it was before

Coach Beilein 
liked quick shots 
if they were 
wide open.

Coach Howard 
likes quick 
shots ... smart 
quick shots.


It was a practice just like any other for the 

Miami Heat.

The starters were out on the floor running 

through their offensive schemes against the 

scout team. Among the latter, per usual, was 

then-assistant coach Juwan Howard.

Howard, having played 19 years in 

the NBA, standing at 6-foot-9 and doing 

everything he can to keep in shape, almost 

always ran with the scout team in practice.

In a typical pick-and-roll play, Howard 

handled the ball at the top of the key. It was 

all set to run smoothly — the player came 

over to set the pick for Howard who then 

dribbled around him to execute the play. 

Fighting hard through the screen, guard 

Dion Waiters barrelled through the defender 

hitting Howard square on the chin, and 

cleanly knocking out one of his teeth.

So how did Howard react?

He held his tooth in his hand, waited for 

the right moment to head to his office, placed 

it down on his desk and resumed practice. 

After 
subsequently 
seeking 
medical 

attention, Howard returned to the Heat 

facilities later that day to coach that night’s 

game. There was even a rotation of the 

assistant coaches who had to talk to the 

media at halftime, and Howard’s number 

was called.

“And I still talked, tooth missing and 

everything,” Howard told The Daily. “Why 

not? A) we’re gonna make no excuses and B) 

you gotta embrace the suck. And that time I 

embraced the suck.”

For Howard, the act of palming a 

recently-separated tooth and continuing on 

business-as-usual was summed up in the 

question “Why not?” It was an afterthought 

— a testament to his professionalism and 

commitment.

For his players, though, the act revealed a 

man who was undeniably committed to the 

game, his team and his family.

“When his tooth came out, he didn’t even 

come out of the game,” then-Heat guard Josh 

Richardson told The Daily. “And I remember 

just being like, ‘That’s crazy!’ And we’re all 

looking at his tooth like, ‘Uhhhhh, you gonna 

get that?’ He just like had it in his hand.”

Tooth in hand, Howard continued down 

the road of a transformative time in his 

career with the Heat.

***

If there was one thing the players knew 

Howard for as a coach it was energy. Energy, 

energy, energy. He would routinely single-

handedly liven up flat practices or get on 

guys for not showing an attitude up to his 

standards.

And typically, he did that the only way 

he knew how: by being vocal and playing 

basketball.

Talk to former players on those Heat 

rosters and they will regale you with tales 

of ‘17’ — the nickname given to Howard by 

LeBron James for his 17 years (really 19) in 

the NBA. They recount stories from practice 

where Howard, unlike nearly all other 

assistant coaches, would run with the scout 

team and do everything he could to dunk on 

players often 10-plus years younger than him 

or block their shots.

And the team loved it. Vociferously 

screaming, “Get that shit out of here!” after 

registering a block or dunking right on 

a guy’s head, Howard would revel in the 

team’s cheers.

Walking in the building every morning, 

Howard made sure everyone knew where 

the level of energy was going to be that day 

— as high as it could possibly be. Getting 

excited about things as banal as a cup of 

coffee, Howard would bellow, “Got my 

coffee today!” strolling down the halls of the 

facilities.

Howard’s honesty also enamored his 

players.

As an assistant with the Heat, Howard’s 

official responsibilities included developing 

the big men on the roster and optimizing 

defense. In these efforts, Miami’s centers 

Hassan Whiteside and Bam Adebayo are 

testaments to that.

Ask either one and they will be quick to 

point to Howard’s honesty as a trait that sets 

him apart. He will tell you like it is every 

time regardless of whether it’s something 

you want to hear or not.

“He 
was 
honest,” 

Adebayo said. “He never 

lied to me. He never ran 

away from the fact that I 

needed to hear something, 

he would say it, he never 

shied away from that. 

And I feel like that’s what 

really brought me closer to 

Juwan was that he was so 

honest with me.”

Added Whiteside: “He 

was like the guy that’s like, 

if there are guys playing 

around or something, he’ll let ’em know. He’d 

say, ‘You’re not taking this serious,’ or he’d 

let you know. I mean he was just honest. He’d 

keep it to you straight every time.”

For almost all of Howard’s Miami 

coaching stint, he was just an assistant. 

Assigned to player development and defense, 

he was never able to use his leadership skills 

as the man in charge. That is, until the 2016 

Summer League rolled around.

Each year, each NBA team selects one 

of the assistant coaches to lead its Summer 

League roster in early competition. In 2016, 

it was Howard’s time.

It was Howard’s first time ever serving 

in a head coach position. In many ways, it 

was the perfect opportunity for the young 

coach — an ability to get his feet wet with the 

position without being completely thrown to 

the wolves.

While he wasn’t reinventing the wheel 

or tasked with redesigning Heat concepts, 

Howard was able to learn some of the 

minutiae of the position — how to talk in 

timeouts, who to call on when games are 

getting close, how to scream on the sidelines.

“He defined guys’ roles early, and I think 

that was good for a coach to be able to do 

that,” said Richardson, one of the key players 

on that Summer League 

team. “He would give good 

speeches, get his message 

across, and he’s a good 

speaker in front of guys, 

and I know that’s probably 

tough in your first coaching 

job having to give an 

opening speech at training 

camp, or having to be the 

guy talking to the team 

every timeout and stuff 

like that, but I think he did 

a great job navigating that 

for the first time.”

The Heat would place fourth that year, 

going 3-2 through the tournament. 

But Howard left with something far more 

valuable than the trophy — confidence in 

his ability to become the head coach of a 

basketball team someday.

“It taught me a lot in that I enjoyed the 

experience, I learned from it,” Howard said. 

“I left there that summer thinking, ‘You 

know, I can be a head coach in this league.’ It 

gave me a vote of confidence.”

Before that, Howard had had no problem 

being vocal. No experience talking to a team 

with the title of “head coach,” sure, but he’s 

always been a leader in the locker room.

And no one recognized that more than

being vocal. No experience talking to a team 

with the title of “head coach,” sure, but he’s 

always been a leader in the locker room.

And no one recognized that more than 

Howard’s old coach on the Portland Trail 

Blazers, Nate McMillan.

Howard often credits McMillan with 

being the first person he spoke to about his 

desire to coach, but McMillan saw it coming 

long before those words ever left Howard’s 

lips. Once Howard joined the Trail Blazers, 

McMillan immediately saw an opportunity 

to use Howard not only as a liaison between 

the players and the coaches but as an 

excellent resource with a high basketball IQ.

“When I had the opportunity to work 

with him in Portland, I really wanted to pick 

his brain,” McMillan said. “I wanted him 

to be a part of that organization because I 

knew he could assist me with the players in 

getting my message, whatever my message 

was, across to them both as a player and as 

a coach.”

Any first glance at Howard’s credentials 

may not tell the whole story. Some may 

be inclined to write off his first year at the 

helm as an adjustment period — some time 

off from Michigan’s recent success due to 

17’s lack of experience. Perhaps a faulty 

assumption. Howard’s been doing this for a 

long time.

***

Minutes 
after 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team dismantled Saginaw Valley 

State in an exhibition win, the ex-big man sat 

down at the podium, nearly ready to address 

the field after his first game coaching in 

Crisler Center.

He asked for a few minutes to prepare 

before glancing down at a freshly printed 

stat sheet. He poured over the numbers, 

evaluating 
his 
team’s 
first 
official 

performance then addressed the media.

A small gesture, but a testament to the 

man’s process. Making the transition from 

the NBA back to college is no small task, and 

Howard is going to need to pick up every 

detail along the way.

Many will speculate about how Howard 

is adapting to the more frequent use of the 

zone on defense or the pace of play in the 

weeks and possibly even years to come. 

But Howard will have to make leadership 

adjustments, too.

College students are at different points in 

their lives than professional athletes. While 

the days of Juwan swatting balls in practice 

may be over as he takes on a different role 

with his players, Howard promises to 

continue his signature brand of honesty, fun 

and professionalism to the job at hand.

“I’m 
an 
even-keeled 
guy,” 
Howard 

said. “I’m also a guy that’s gonna hold you 

accountable when you’re not doing your job. 

I’m not a big yeller or screamer, but I know 

how to make sure my voice resonates and 

carries so when I speak, the group listens.

“I want my players to know this: we’re 

gonna compete hard. There will be some 

moments when we hit some rough patches in 

the season, but at the end of the day, I want 

us to be able to say, once we look back at the 

end of the season, ‘We did have fun.’”

More than that, his approach for on-the-

court development may differ as well. 

Working with big men in the NBA, the 

focus was not so much about technique at 

the big man position but rather about the 

mental game — how to be patient and goade 

the defense into making mistakes. How to be 

a professional.

“Being patient. I feel like that was the No. 

1 thing he helped me with,” Adebayo said. 

“Just taking my time in the post. It wasn’t 

really on moves, but if you’re patient and let 

the defense make mistakes, and I started 

seeing that as the years went on and last year 

the last 30 games I started catching onto it 

and started realizing it.

Roster breakdown

Roster turnover — and adjusting 
to it — is an inherent part of college 
basketball. A top program’s best 
players tend to move on annually 
to the professional ranks as a new 
batch of heralded freshmen take 
over. 
Michigan, which can now be 
classified among the very elite 
programs in the sport, is no 
different. Jordan Poole, Charles 
Matthews and Ignas Brazdeikis all 
moved on from last year’s Sweet 
Sixteen team, taking 57 percent of 
the Wolverines’ scoring production 
with them. With the loss of that trio, 
a few newcomers and a completely 
different coaching philosophy being 
implemented under new coach 
Juwan Howard, there is no shortage 
of uncertainty accompanying this 
year’s Wolverines. 
And yet, the cupboard is far from 
bare. Three linchpins and a number 
of talented, albeit unproven, players 
return to Ann Arbor. Whether the 
latter can step up to the plate will 
likely dictate how far this team goes 
in Howard’s first season. 
The Daily broke down what’s 
still stocked in that cupboard for 
the coming season. 
Guards
Since he officially secured the 
point guard job as a sophomore 
under former coach John Beilein, 
Zavier Simpson has become the 
heart and soul of the Wolverines. 
In his senior season, expect more of 
the same. 
Simpson is the unquestioned 
leader of this team and one of the 
best point guards in the country. 
He earned All-Big Ten second 
team honors a season ago, but only 
because Michigan State guard 
Cassius Winston also plays his 
position. Though not a potent 
scorer as evidenced by his 8.8 points 
per game last year, Simpson and his 
patented hook-shot have become a 
nationwide phenomenon. A floor 
general in every sense of the word, 
Simpson registered a 3.2 assist-to-
turnover ratio last season, which 
ranked first in the Big Ten and sixth 
in the country. He also led the team 
in steals and was named to the Big 
Ten’s All-Defensive Team. 
Simpson’s 
contributions 
to 
Michigan 
extend 
well 
beyond 

statistics, 
though. 
Hard-nosed, 
vocal and sometimes brash, he will 
hold his teammates accountable 
and is about as dependable as it gets 
on this roster.
Junior guard Eli Brooks, on the 
other hand, will be asked to step 
up more than ever before. Serving 
primarily as Simpson’s backup 
last 
season, 
Brooks 
averaged 
just 12.8 minutes per game. Now 
without Poole, Brooks will likely 
start alongside Simpson in the 
backcourt. Although he struggled 
with confidence a season ago, 
Brooks is a capable shooter and 
defender. 
In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
exhibition game against Saginaw 
Valley State on Friday, he notched a 
double-double with 13 points and 10 
rebounds. Teammates and coaches 
have repeatedly praised his work 
ethic and understated leadership 
this offseason. If Brooks improves 
his decision-making and is more 
aggressive on offense, he could 
make a much-needed leap. 
Sophomores 
David 
DeJulius 
and Adrien Nunez fall very much 
into the “talented but unproven” 
category. 
Both 
are 
slated 
for 
significantly more playing time 
than last season and will be key 
in replacing the loss of offensive 
production from a season ago. 
Despite only being 6-foot, DeJulius 
is an energetic, athletic and crafty 
ball-handler who can score in the 
paint and knock down an open 
shot from deep. Nunez is a long, 
sharpshooting wing, who will be 
more of a “catch-and-shoot” option 
on offense. Defensively, there are 
question marks surrounding both 
of these players and their ability to 
lockdown opposing guards. 
Forwards
Isaiah 
Livers 
flashed 
his 
potential 
multiple 
times 
last 
season as Michigan’s sixth-man. 
Now without the wing presences 
of Matthews and Brazdeikis, the 
junior — who averaged just under 
eight points per game a year ago 
— has an opportunity to shine. 
He’s a threat from behind the arc 
(42.6-percent last year) but is also 
athletic at the rim. As demonstrated 
by his team-high 24-point outing 
against SVSU, Livers has the 
potential to lead the Wolverines 
in scoring. Already a versatile 
defender with his 6-foot-7 frame, 
Livers’ work in the offseason to get 
in better shape should pay dividends 

on the other end of the floor. With 
two years of playing experience 
under his belt, he joins Simpson as 
a respected upperclassman. 
Though 
inconsistent 
overall, 
Brandon Johns Jr. showed some 
promise off the bench last season 
as a freshman. While he has a 
professional build, a good motor 
and can provide a scoring burst if 
needed, he struggled at times to 
stay in front of his man defensively 
and battle for rebounds with other 
bigs. Shoring up those areas of his 
game could be key to him getting 
more playing time. 
A similar sentiment holds true 
for his classmate, Colin Castleton. 
At 6-foot-11, Castleton is a shot-
blocking big who can also step 
out offensively and knock down 
a perimeter shot. As a freshman 
though, he was overpowered by 
other bigs on the glass and wasn’t 
skilled enough around the basket to 
make his presence felt offensively. 
Realizing Michigan lacks depth 
downlow, 
Howard 
has 
been 
working closely with Castleton to 
help him along. 
Johns Jr. and Castleton will be 
relied on even more during the first 
few weeks of the regular season 

due to the absence of highly-touted 
freshman 
Franz 
Wagner, 
who 
suffered a broken wrist in practice 
two weeks ago. Just 18 years old, 
Wagner played professionally for 
Alba Berlin in Germany’s Basketball 
Bundesliga last season and earned 
the 2019 BBL Best Young Player 
Award. Though he has inevitably 
received comparisons to his older 
brother, Moe Wagner, he’s arrived 
as a more polished offensive 
player — with a sweet stroke and 
good distribution skills — and is a 
more willing defensive player. The 
coaching staff has raved about his 
temperament and savviness, so 
look for him to possibly take over 
a starting role upon returning to 
action. 
Center
If Simpson and Livers are 
the first two linchpins for the 
Wolverines, 7-foot-1, 265-lb senior 
Jon Teske is the other. “Big Sleep,” 
as he’s known to his teammates, 
has steadily improved throughout 
his time at Michigan, culminating 
in a junior statline of 9.5 points, 
seven rebounds and two blocks per 
game. He possesses 3-point range 
but arguably relied on that too 
frequently a season ago. As a rim-

running center always active in 
transition, he should benefit from 
Howard’s 
up-tempo, 
transition 
offense — though his conditioning 
will be tested. Defensively, he’s 
one of the conference’s best shot-
blockers and has the size to match 
opposing bigs in the post. 
Backing up Teske at the ‘five’ 
is senior Austin Davis. Davis is 
a physical post player who can 
finish strong at the rim but isn’t 
particularly 
technical. 
He’ll 
provide a high-energy option off 
the bench for the Wolverines. 
Outlook
The 2019-2020 installment of 
Michigan is notably athletic but 
lacks a refined scorer, especially 
while 
Wagner’s 
sidelined. 
Howard’s emphasis on pushing 
the ball up the floor will cater to 
the team’s athleticism but its half-
court offense may be suspect. 
The 
Wolverines 
will 
undoubtedly rely on their tested 
veterans like Simpson, Livers and 
Teske. But the development of 
last season’s fringe contributors 
— Brooks, DeJulius, Johns Jr. and 
Castleton — will largely dictate 
how far Michigan progresses in 
Howard’s first year.

Every 
year 
for 
the 
Tipoff 
edition, The Daily’s basketball beat 
puts out a preview of the entire 
conference. Plenty of other outlets 
do similar pieces around the start 
of the season. They’re big, they’re 
unwieldy, and, honestly, they can 
get a little boring. 
Not this one.
If I’m going to write this Big Ten 
preview, then I’m going to have 
some fun with it. And I’m not going 
to waste your time. 
Let’s just talk basketball.
***
No. 1 Michigan State
Tom Izzo. Cassius Winston. So, 
yeah. They’re gonna be good.
Izzo isn’t just one of the best 
coaches in college hoops right now. 
He’s an all-time great. Izzo has 
brought the Spartans a national 
championship, eight Final Four 
appearances, including last year’s, 
and nine Big Ten championships. 
This team looks as formidable as 
any he’s coached, especially with 
a top-ranked offense and a senior 
point guard in Winston who’s a 
favorite for National Player of the 
Year. The Spartans have been at or 
near the top in pretty much every 
projection this year and with good 
reason.
Honestly, it’s hard to see anyone 
else winning the conference this 
year. This is a team that should 

repeat as Big Ten champs, a team 
that could cut down the nets in 
April – and a team that just might.
No. 18 Ohio State
Chris Holtmann is doing some 
things in Columbus. When the 
now-third-year head coach took the 
helm in 2017, the Buckeyes were a 
middling program that spent most 
of the year near the .500 mark. 
Holtmann has since led that once-
middling program to the NCAA 
Tournament in both of his seasons 
as head coach, and this season 
doesn’t look to be an exception. 
Holtmann returns 10 players 
from last season’s roster, including 
two of his top three scorers, 
Kaleb and Andre Wesson. It’s a 
young Ohio State squad – Andre 
Wesson is the team’s only senior – 
and Holtmann admitted to some 
growing 
pains, 
especially 
on 
defense. But Holtmann has proven 
himself more than capable at 
turning teams with depth questions 
into contenders in March, both at 
Ohio State and before that at Butler. 
There’s no reason for this season to 
be any different.
Wisconsin
I’d like to dedicate this section 
to my summer internship in the 
office 
of 
Congressman 
Glenn 
Grothman, R-Wis., after which I 
am proud to call myself an honorary 
Wisconsinite, despite what my 
beatmate Jacob Kopnick might say.
This year marks something of an 
inflection point for the Wisconsin 

program. The Badgers lose an all-
timer in Ethan Happ, a three-time 
all-Big Ten first-teamer who carried 
the team for much of his time in 
Madison.
If Wisconsin wants to stay near 
the top of the conference, it’ll have 
to bring out a much-different look 
than what’s worked in the past. But 
the pieces are there: The Badgers 
are bringing back three players 
who started every game last year, 
and with the likes of senior guard 
Brevin Printzil ready to take on a 
bigger role in Happ’s absence, their 
roster is plenty talented.
So honestly, dear reader, I don’t 
have a solid feel for this Wisconsin 
team. It’s going to depend a lot on 
that new look. At this point, it’s just 
wait and see. 
No. 7 Maryland
My home and native land! The 
Terps are coming off a second-
round exit in last year’s NCAA 
Tournament, and with most of their 
roster returning, they’re a projected 
top-five team in the Big Ten, and 
easily a top-25 team nationwide; 
KenPom has Maryland ranked at 
No. 16 going into the season, and the 
AP Poll puts them at No. 7. 
There’s a chance I’ve been 
brainwashed growing up half an 
hour from College Park, but Mark 
Turgeon’s a hell of a coach and 
experienced, too. He’s been able to 
mold this young team, and it’s got a 
chip on its shoulder. After a .500 Big 
Ten finish in 2018, and what they 

see as a too-early 2019 tournament 
departure, these Terrapins are still 
hungry. If that weren’t enough, 
they return two of their top three 
scorers, including one of their 
most exciting – and intimidating – 
players in sophomore forward Jalen 
Smith. 
Fear the Turtle, indeed.
Iowa
I drove through the entirety of 
Iowa twice this summer on my 
way to and from the College World 
Series in Omaha. I have nothing to 
say about Iowa as a state. So let’s 
talk about its basketball team.
The Hawkeyes could go either 
way this year. Iowa was a tough 
opponent last year, but some of the 
key pieces of that team are missing. 
Forward Tyler Cook, keystone of 
last year’s Hawkeye front court, is 
gone, having declared for the NBA 
draft, redshirt senior guard Isaiah 
Moss transferred to Kansas and 
senior guard Jordan Bohannon 
underwent 
potentially-season-
ending hip surgery. 
But there’s plenty of talent 
elsewhere in this Iowa roster. 
Sophomore guard Joe Wieskamp is 
a dangerous shooter, and at 6-foot-
11, junior center Luka Garza will 
be a force to be reckoned with on 
rebounds.
This Iowa team probably won’t 
be as much of a challenge as last 
year’s. But I wouldn’t overlook 
them, either.
Indiana

Luckily for me (and you), my 
fellow Hebrew school sufferer and 
good friend Matt Cohen covers 
the team for Indiana’s student 
newspaper, 
the 
Daily 
Student. 
Here’s what he has to say about the 
Hoosiers this year:
“Well first off, don’t appreciate 
that you’re insinuating we haven’t 
always been good friends. It’s fine. 
I’m not hurt at all. 
“IU is in a bit of a transition 
period. Gone are the days of Juwan 
Morgan leading IU inside and 
Romeo Langford providing the star 
power, even if that lasted for just 
one season. But while IU may not 
have the primary scoring options it 
had a year ago, it has significantly 
more depth. IU potentially goes 11 
deep this season. The front-court 
depth has been bolstered by the 
addition of graduate transfer Joey 
Brunk from Butler and the return of 
redshirt freshman Jerome Hunter, a 
top-100 ranked recruit, from injury.
“Archie Miller has a roster that 
may not boast the star power of a 
year ago, but it might be a better 
overall team. These Hoosiers seem 
like a team that should hang around 
the sixth-to-eighth place region 
of the Big Ten standings which, at 
least in prior years, has been enough 
to make it to March.”
Having known Matt for as 
long as I have, I can tell you he’s 
optimistic almost to a fault (this 
is a kid who thinks Joe Flacco is a 
Hall of Famer). Then again, I did 
pick Indiana as my Big Ten surprise 
team this year. So for the sake of my 
dignity, let’s just hope he’s right.
Illinois
I tried to think of a fun and 
interesting way to start this section. 
I really did. But I’m tired. So let’s just 
get into it.
Sophomore guard Trent Frazier, 
freshman 
guard 
Ayo 
Dosunmu 
and 
freshman 
forward 
Giorgi 
Bezhanishvili headline a roster as 
talented as any in the Big Ten. Their 
offense looks dangerous, and they’re 
a team that’s young and tired of being 
overlooked like so much of the state 
they represent. Their non-conference 
schedule is smooth enough that they 
could be in a good spot heading into 
Big Ten play, and from there, this is a 
team that has the potential to take off. 
With a roster this talented, 
this could be a breakout year for 
the Fighting Illini. Let’s just hope 
the announcers figure out how to 
pronounce those names.

No. 23 Purdue
First 
order 
of 
business: 
Boilermakers? Really? I’ve just never 
understood it. Nobody mansplain it to 
me in the comments. I don’t care that 
much. 
Frankly, they’re probably going to 
be pretty good. KenPom puts them 
at No.7 overall. They’ve been a pretty 
consistent force in Big Ten basketball 
over the past few years. They busted 
up my junior-year homecoming date’s 
bracket pretty good a few years back 
when a team he told me was overrated 
made it to the Sweet Sixteen instead 
of losing in the first round, and they 
got to the Elite Eight last year before 
falling to eventual champion Virginia.
Purdue’s roster is talented enough 
to make up for the loss of Carsen 
Edwards, with players like junior 
guard Nojel Eastern and junior center 
Matt Haarms poised to step in and 
lead the team.
Honestly, that’s about it. This team 
is definitely going to be good. They 
might even be great. They’re certainly 
heading in that direction.
Nebraska
Sophomore guard Cam Mack has 
high hopes for this Cornhusker team.

“This year, this team – we can get 
to the Sweet Sixteen,” he said at Big 
Ten Media Day. “We can win a couple 
games in the tournament. We’re 
gonna shock a lot of people.”
But I’m going to be straight up with 
you here: Nebraska’s probably going to 
be a bit of a pushover this year. They’ve 
got just two returning players, only one 
of whom has even played a minute of 
Big Ten basketball. The Cornhuskers 
have 14 new faces, and two transfers 
sitting out. It’s a rebuilding year.
But they’ve got a really exciting new 
head coach in Fred Hoiberg, usually 
remembered for his unsuccessful 
tenure with the NBA’s Chicago Bulls 
rather than his imposing offense at 
Iowa State. Hoiberg used transfers 
and his recruiting talents to turn his 
alma mater into a serious tournament 
contender, and his excitement about 
Nebraska and the program he wants 
to build there is palpable. It’s hard to 
find a reason Hoiberg can’t work the 
same magic in Lincoln.
This year, the Cornhuskers are 
probably going to be a bit of an also-
ran. But with the energy around this 
program, I don’t think it’s going to be 
that way for long.
Northwestern
I wanted to write “nerds” and 
leave it at that, but my editors said 
I had to write more than that. But 
honestly, things aren’t looking great 

this year for Northwestern. The 
Wildcats made their first trip to the 
NCAA Tournament in 2017, and 
even got a first-round win over their 
fellow nerds, Vanderbilt. It looked the 
Wildcats might have finally gotten 
their heads in the game.
I don’t know what happened to 
that program, but it sure as hell hasn’t 
showed up since then. Northwestern 
went 15-17 in 2018 and 13-19 last year. 
This year doesn’t look like it’ll be 
much different. They graduated much 
of last year’s already-tepid offensive 
production. And while newcomers 
like freshman forward Robbie Beran, 
a four-star prospect, and freshman 
point guard Boo Buie show some 
potential, it’s probably unreasonable 
to expect them to contribute much 
right away.
Stick to studying, Wildcats.
Rutgers
Last year’s basketball beat wants 
me to reiterate their firm conviction 
that Rutgers will make the National 
Invitation Tournament this year. 
Other than that, there’s no way I can 
follow up Ethan Sears on Steve Pikiell 
and this program, so I’ll let him do the 
talking.
***
So there you have it: a hopefully-
not-too-painless preview of this year’s 
conference field.
Now let’s play some basketball.

identity Howard 
has 
associated 
with 
his 
new 
team since his 
announcement as 
head coach has 
been family. He 
is a family man 
through and through as evidenced 
not only with the way talks about 
and deals with his team but through 
small acts such as bringing his kids 
to the facilities when he was in 
Miami.
Including 
his 
three 
sons, 
all 
basketball 
players, 
in 
his 
work 
undoubtedly 
grew 
their 
appreciation for the game. In fact, 
Howard’s eldest, Juwan Howard Jr. 
was even on a Heat practice squad in 
2016. The younger Howard blended 
right in, befriending the players, 
even playing video games with 
Whiteside.

During this time, Howard didn’t 
treat his son any different — mixing 
honesty and family, telling his son 
what he needed to work on, the 
lessons of his playing and coaching 
days coming into full effect.
It is these qualities that will 
perhaps aid Howard in the biggest 
adjustment to the college basketball 
coaching lifestyle: recruiting.
Howard 
is 
now tasked with 
selling 
himself 
and Michigan as a 
premier temple of 
college basketball 
development. Ask 
those who knew 
him as a coach, 
and it’s not hard to 
see what that pitch might sound like.
“I think the No. 1 thing that 
will stick out for him is that he’s a 
people person, and he’s about kids,” 
Adebayo said. “Like he doesn’t want 
anything from us. Like he’ll give you 
the shirt off his back, that’s the type 
of person he is.”
This is a man who embodies 
commitment. A man who cried 
when he was introduced as the head 
coach of the men’s basketball team. 
This is a man who would give you 
the shirt off his back, they say. And 
maybe, if you hang around long 
enough, the tooth from his mouth.
