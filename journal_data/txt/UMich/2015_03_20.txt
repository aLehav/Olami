Aaron Dworkin to 
be next School of 
Music, Theatre & 

Dance dean

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

At their monthly meeting 

Thursday, the University’s Board 
of 
Regents 
approved 
Aaron 

Dworkin, founder and presi-
dent of the Detroit-based Sphinx 
Organization, as the new dean of 
the School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance. Dworkin will make his-
tory as the first Black dean of the 
school.

Dworkin’s 
five-year 
term 

begins July 20.

“I am tremendously honored to 

join this community comprised of 
leaders committed to scholarship 
and artistic excellence,” Dworkin 
said. “As we progress into an age 
which redefines the definitions 
of artistic pursuits, I am eager to 
bring my experiences and skill-
sets to bear as we nurture and 
empower a diverse student body 
to embody the best of our society 
in this new era.”

Dworkin was also appointed a 

tenured professor in the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance.

Widely regarded as one of the 

foremost violinists, he is also 
known as one of the foremost 
leaders of the performing arts in 
the world. During the course of 
his career, he has gained awards 
including the National Governors 
Association 2005 Distinguished 
Service to State Government 
Award, 
Harvard 
University’s 

Vosgerchian 
Teaching 
Award 

and BET’s History Makers in the 
Making Award. President Barack 
Obama selected Dworkin as his 
first presidential appointment to 
the National Council on the Arts. 
He is also a MacArthur Fellow 
and a member of the Royal Phil-
harmonic Society in London.

Recognizing the lack of minor-

ities in the field of classical music, 
Dworkin created the Sphinx 
Organization to help reflect the 
diversity of orchestras in the 
nation. The Detroit-based orga-
nization is a national nonprofit 
that provides K-12 performing 
arts education and mentorship 
opportunities for minorities and 
students in underserved commu-
nities. It currently reaches 20,000 

Democratic caucus 
introduces bills to 
legalize same-sex 
marriage in state

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Though Michigan’s same-

sex marriage ban is currently 
before the U.S. Supreme Court, 
Democratic lawmakers have 
decided to take action on the 
issue through the legislature.

On Thursday, a group of 

Democratic state representa-
tives and senators introduced 
an array of bills on the issue, 
chief among them ones which 
would 
allow 
Michigan 
to 

become the 38th state to rec-
ognize same-sex marriages by 
both legalizing it and removing 
the state’s ban.

State Rep. Jeremy Moss 

(D–Southfield) and State Sen. 
Rebekah 
Warren 
(D–Ann 

Arbor) sponsored legislation to 
repeal the state’s ban on same-
sex marriage. State Rep. Adam 
Zemke (D–Ann Arbor), State 
Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr. (D–East 
Lansing) and State Rep. Jeff 
Irwin (D–Ann Arbor) spon-
sored concurrent legislation to 
legalize same-sex marriage.

State Rep. Sam Singh (D–

East Lansing) and State Rep. 
Robert 
Wittenberg 
(D–Oak 

Park) also sponsored legisla-

tion on related issues, includ-
ing marriage licenses and tax 
benefits.

“It’s a whole package of 

bills, covering a wide variety of 
things like allowing same sex 
marriage and recognizing out 
of state marriages and more,” 
Wittenberg said.

The legality of same-sex 

marriage 
in 
Michigan 
has 

shifted significantly over the 
past decade. In 2004, voters 
approved a state constitutional 
amendment defining marriage 
as only applicable between a 
man and a woman. In 2012, 
Hazel Park residents April 
DeBoer and Jayne Rowse sued 
the state over the constitution-
ality of the amendment, lead-
ing to a protracted court battle 
that concluded in a district 
court ruling that the ban was 
unconstitutional. That deci-
sion was appealed to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Sixth 
Circuit, which overturned the 
decision, finding the ban con-
stitutional. Rowse and DeBoer 
are now appealing the case 
to the Supreme Court, which 
announced in January that it 
would take on the case. Oral 
arguments are scheduled for 
April 28.

Roughly 300 same-sex cou-

ples in Michigan are currently 
legally married. The couples 
were married during a roughly 
24-hour window between the 
District Court’s decision, and

DETROIT — The Michigan 

hockey team lives to fight another 
day.

Entering 
Thursday’s 
game 

against Wisconsin in the first round 
of 
the 
Big 

Ten 
Tour-

nament, 
the 

Wolverines 
were faced with a do-or-die situa-
tion. And fortunately for Michigan, 
it prevailed against the Badgers for 
the fifth time this season, 5-1.

The Wolverines struck first, 

when senior forward Zach Hyman 
put home a puck that had just rung 
off the iron. Freshman forward 
Dylan Larkin started the play, firing 
the puck toward the net before the 
puck ricocheted off of a Wisconsin 
player’s skate to Hyman, who put it 
home.

Hyman’s tally was his 20th of 

the year, and the senior became 
the first Michigan hockey player to 
score 20 or more goals in a season 
since Louie Caporusso did the same 
in 2009-10. More notably, Hyman’s 
goal marked his 50th point of the 
season — the first Wolverine to 
accomplish such a feat since now-

As election

With elections for the next 

academic year’s Central Stu-
dent Government less than 
a week away, The Michigan 
Daily spoke to a several stu-
dent organizations on campus 
about their relationship with 
the body and the initiatives 

they would like CSG to focus 
on in the 2015-2016 school 
year.

CSG currently has a Stu-

dent Organization Outreach 
commission. The CSG website 
states the purpose of the com-
mission is to meet with at least 
10 student organizations per 
week. The commission is also 
tasked with creating monthly 
reports on student groups’ 
needs and suggestions on how 
to address those needs.

The 
University’s 
South 

Asian 
American 
Network, 

Hillel and the Panhellenic 
Association responded to the 
Daily, and all listed increas-

ing active collaboration with 
student organizations as one 
of their top priorities for the 
student assembly. Black Stu-
dent Union declined to com-
ment. The Michigan Daily 
was unable to reach SAPAC 
and MSA for comment.

SAAN programming direc-

tor Fatema Chamak, a Public 
Policy junior, said she felt it 
can be difficult to receive sup-
port from CSG. She said she 
would like to see CSG reach 
out to student organizations 
like SAAN, instead of placing 
the burden of reaching out on 
the organizations.

Thursday’s University Board 

of Regents meeting included 
the approval of two North Cam-

pus renovation projects, seven 
honorary degree recipients and 
an update on the University’s 
research funding.

Research report

S. Jack Hu, interim execu-

tive vice president for research, 
delivered the annual research 
report, which showed that the 
University’s annual research 
funding fell to $1.3 billion in 
2014 — a slight decrease from 
the record high $1.32 billion in 
fiscal year 2013.

“Research is an important 

mission of the University,” Hu 
said. “With research, we cre-
ate new knowledge and under-
standing 
that 
enhance 
our 

educational process.”

This past year, Hu reported, 

the University funded more than 
3,500 graduate students and 
1,100 undergraduate students 
for research projects. Though 
the total number of research 
contracts awarded increased by 
4.1 percent, he added, the total 
dollar value of those contracts 
dropped by about 16 percent.

Hu said the decrease in fund-

ing is due in part to the decline 
in 
federal 
support, 
which 

decreased 4.5 percent this year. 
To help curb decreasing federal 
sponsorship, the University has 
looked to other avenues to find 
funding, including to industries 
and foundations. Hu noted that 
nonfederal source funding was 
up 6.25 percent this year — a 
total of $124.4 million.

‘U’ research shows in-car 
alcohol tests prevent crashes

Devices can check for 
intoxication before 
allowing vehicle 

to start

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT 

Daily Staff Reporter

The combination of drinking 

and driving could soon be a thing 
of the past.

University 
researchers 

from the Injury Center and 
the 
Transportation 
Research 

Institute 
published 
a 
study 

Thursday exploring the potential 
effects of alcohol ignition interlock 
devices if they were installed in 
every newly purchased vehicle in 
the United States over a 15-year 
period.

The 
devices, 
currently 
in 

development 
by 
the 
federal 

government, can either operate 
as a Breathalyzer that determines 

if the driver is under a certain 
blood alcohol content, or through 
the 
steering 
wheel 
using 
a 

transdermal approach that reads 
BAC through the skin. They are 
currently only mandated for use 
by repeated driving under the 
influence offenders, and do not 
allow the car to turn on if the 
driver’s blood alcohol level is over 
a specific percentage.

The study concluded that with 

the devices, the United States 
could avoid 85 percent of alcohol-
related motor vehicle crash deaths 
over the 15-year period, meaning 
over 59,000 deaths and 1.25 
million non-fatal injuries.

Dr. Patrick Carter, assistant 

professor of Emergency Medicine, 
led the research, and Dr. Rebecca 
Cunningham, 
professor 
of 

Emergency Medicine and Public 
Health, and Jonathan Rupp, Carol 
Flannagan and Ray Bingham of 
the TRI, co-authored the report.

Carter said he pursued this 

angle of research because drunk 

driving is a pressing health issue.

“It’s important to note that 

alcohol-involved motor vehicle 
crashes are a significant public 
health problem,” he said. “This 
would be one way of preventing 
a drinking driver from getting 
behind the wheel and causing 
non-fatal and fatal injuries.”

The researchers used data from 

two data sets, Fatality Analysis 
Reporting 
System 
and 
the 

National Automotive Sampling 
System’s 
General 
Estimates 

System, covering 2006 to 2010. 
FARS calculates fatalities from 
every motor vehicle crash in the 
country, while NASS calculates 
a probability sample to create a 
national ranking of crashes.

Models 
extrapolated 
from 

this data over a 15-year period 
allowed researchers to reach their 
conclusions about the devices.

The study also found that 

the 21-29 age group is the most 
vulnerable 
to 
drinking 
and 

driving, and the addition of these 
devices would prevent nearly 
480,000 
deaths 
and 
injuries 

specifically within that age group.

“(The 21-29 age group) is really 

the hardest age group to intervene 
with,” 
Carter 
said. 
“They’re 

recently legal drinkers and they 
often get behind the wheel after 
drinking, but they’re the hardest 
to intervene.”

Ignition 
interlock 
devices 

typically 
cost 
around 
$400, 

but according to Carter, the 
group’s models estimate that 
the United States would recoup 
the upfront cost of the devices 
in savings within three years of 
implementation.

Rupp, 
the 
TRI 
research 

associate 
professor, 
said 
the 

research and the devices would go 
a long way toward solving driver 
safety issues.

“People have been trying to 

implement 
safety 
systems 
in 

vehicles for 50 years, and there’s 
still people who are killed in 
crashes, so addressing one major 
portion of that, being able to 
reduce that, is going to have a huge 

New effort to 

promote real-world 

experiences for

By SAMIHA MATIN 

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
Taubman 
College 

of 
Architecture 
and 
Urban 

Planning is launching a new 
type of class in the Fall 2015 
semester to provide students 
and professors a more immersive 
learning environment.

Called Master Classes, these 

new environments will consist 
of short professional and skill-
based 
training 
workshops 

focused 
on 
addressing 

current problems in modern 
architectural design. During 
the workshops, which focus 
on experiential learning and 
completing 
experimental 

projects, students will have 
the chance to work with both 
national 
and 
international 

architects.

The classes will be funded 

through the University’s Third 
Century Initiative, which aims 
to engage students in innovative 
educational experiences that 
extend beyond the classroom.

Ellie Abrons, Adam Fure 

and Andrew Holder, assistant 
professors at Taubman College, 
said they founded the project 
to bring more relevance to the 
traditional studio classes used 
in architecture.

“The 
studio 
classes 
are 

very intensive, where a small 
group of students work with 
a single faculty member to 
cultivate their own ideas into 
how designs should work in a 
building,” Holder said. “They 
project their private visions 
about what a building should 
like into their work. However, 
they 
fail 
to 
engage 
with 

contemporary issues of social 

and political significance.”

Instead 
of 
replacing 
the 

conventional 
methods 
used 

in 
studio 
classes, 
Master 

Classes will continue using the 
techniques of intensive studies 
that professors have found most 
successful.

Additionally, 
Master 

Classes will provide numerous 
opportunities 
for 
students 

to learn from experts with 
different 
perspectives. 
A 

greater number of students will 
participate at the workshops, 
which will be styled in the 
format 
of 
a 
hackathon 
to 

increase 
competition 
and 

teamwork between students.

“Instead 
of 
students 

individually 
engaging 
in 
a 

project, 
they 
will 
now 
be 

able to work with the master 
practitioners to tackle issues of 
social significance,” he said.

Holder also highlighted the 

efficiency of Master Classes 
compared to studio classes. In 
studio classes, students work 
on a single building design over 
the course of an entire semester 
or 
academic 
year. 
With 
a 

Master 
Class, 
the 
course’s 

key component is a three-day 
intensive workshop designed to 
embody the competitive spirit 
of a hack-a-thon. During the 
workshops, students work with 
visiting experts to work on a 
design project related to the 
professional’s own work.

Holder said he hoped that 

the Master Classes would be 
eventually 
implemented 
in 

various other fields, particularly 
in science and medicine, which 
require laboratory work.

“We think that the way 

architects work and think about 
problems can be applicable 
to such fields,” Holder said. 
“For now, we want the Master 
Classes to keep on changing and 
getting bigger so that we can 
soon incorporate these methods 
into other fields.”

The classes will also focus 

on giving students first-hand 
experiences, 
drawing 
from 

infrastructure present around 
campus, Ann Arbor and Detroit. 
Holder said he hopes by working 
on real, local projects, students 
will better see the impact of 
design.

“Architecture is a very social 

aspect,” Holder said. “Everyone 
is affected by it. And that’s 
exactly what Master Classes 
hope to do.”

Holder 
said 
interacting 

with these local issues will 
also 
provide 
students 
the 

chance to interact with bigger 
architectural ideas as well.

“Master Classes will bring 

the community and the large 
scale issues into the University 
institution,” he said. “Students 
can then address them as 
academic problems as well.”

Taubman 
student 
Dustin 

Murphy said in an e-mail 
interview he is excited about 
the new classes, as they will 
provide him with numerous 
opportunities to work outside 
the studio and gain valuable 
experiences in the field.

“The workshops will provide 

me with new spaces to explore 
my 
place 
in 
architectural 

discipline,” Murphy said. “I 
will able to try new things that 
are outside of my typical design 
sensibilities and discover new 
methods of working.”

Murphy also said he hopes 

the workshops reach a large 
number of students.

“The workshops encourage 

an interdisciplinary approach 
to architecture and require 
critical thinking that actively 
engages the discourse,” Murphy 
said. “Students should utilize 
this 
great 
opportunity 
and 

engage 
with 
the 
discipline 

at the level provided by the 
workshops. In that way, they 
will be able to consider their 
place in architecture, as well 
as the role of architects in the 
world at large.”

societal benefit,” Rupp said.

For the plan to be feasible, 

Carter said the devices must 
become more advanced.

“There’s 
potential 
if 
the 

technology advances far enough 
that the device is seamless to the 
driver experience,” he said. “It 
may not be that the first way to 
go for this is to mandate, it might 
be that maybe it’s a condition for 
getting a discount on your car 
insurance and it’s a voluntary 

action, or parents putting it in their 
teenagers’ vehicles.”

Public 
acceptability 
and 

technological advancement appear 
to be the two biggest obstacles 
to overcome, according to the 
researchers.

Rupp said the technology has 

the potential to become more 
socially acceptable than predicted.

“There have been a lot of surveys 

about how socially acceptable 
the costs are, and I believe in one 
survey 40 percent of people said 
they’d want an alcohol interlock 
device in their car if it were under 
$500,” he said.

professional hockey player Carl 
Hagelin, who notched 50 points in 
2009-10.

“I don’t think you can overes-

timate how important he’s been, 
especially in terms of goal scor-
ing,” said junior forward Andrew 
Copp.

Jumping out to a quick lead is 

something Berenson has preached 
to his team all season, but it con-
sistently failed to do so. So the 
Michigan coach put an even bigger 
emphasis on starting quickly this 
week, knowing that if his squad 
reverted back to its bad habits, 
there wouldn’t be another chance 
at redemption.

And right on cue, Michigan (13-

8-0-0 Big Ten, 21-14-0-0 overall) 
took control of the game from the 
get-go, creating the majority of 
the game’s scoring opportunities, 
while also limiting the Badgers 
(4-26-5-2, 2-16-3-2) to just five 
shots on goal in the first frame.

“They’re an unbelievable team,” 

said Wisconsin netminder Joel 
Rumpel. “But our guys battled 
hard. If a few bounces went our 
way and not theirs, it would have 
been a closer game, but I give them 
a lot of credit. They’re a very tal-
ented team.”

The Wolverines wasted no time 

starting where they left off in the 
second frame. Senior defenseman 
Andrew Sinelli found twine for the 
first time this season, throwing 
what looked liked a pass toward 
Rumpel before the puck deflected 
off a Badger defenseman’s stick 
and into the net.

The goal was certainly unchar-

acteristic for the Wisconsin senior, 
who Michigan coach Red Beren-
son called “one of the best goal-
ies in college hockey” earlier this 
week.

And it didn’t take long for the 

Wolverines to continue to make 
Rumpel look like just an average 
goalie. With just over 15 minutes 
remaining in the second frame, 
freshman 
defenseman 
Cutler 

Martin fired a shot from the slot 
that Hyman redirected for his sec-
ond goal of the game.

Berenson opted to start junior 

goalie Steve Racine, continuing the 
revolving door that is the Michigan 
goaltending situation. Sophomore 
Zach Nagelvoort started the last 
two games for Michigan before 
losing the starting job Thursday.

Berenson looked smart after 

the game, as Racine — who looked 
comfortable playing in Joe Louis 
Arena earlier this season dur-
ing the Great Lakes Invitational 
— looked like a bona fide starter, 
making 28 saves.

“It’s been back and forth all year 

between Steve Racine and Zach 
Nagelvoort,” Berenson said. “And 
I think Nagelvoort won a big game 
for us in East Lansing last week 
and then we lost the home game. 
I can’t tell you he lost it. But I just 
felt that Racine had probably the 
best part of his season at the GLI.

“And he came in and he gave us 

a life against Michigan Tech and 
then against Michigan State in the 
championship game. So I thought 
we would start with him. But we’re 
not through the weekend yet. But 
it’s a good start for Steve and a 
good start for our team.”

Wisconsin got on the board 

midway through the third peri-
od when the puck found its way 
through a massive net scramble, 
breathing life into the Badgers. 
Quickly after, Wisconsin had a 
5-on-3 opportunity but came up 
empty, shifting the momentum 
back to Michigan.

Just two minutes after, Larkin 

— the Big Ten Freshman of the 
Year — found the back of the net 
after skating coast-to-coast and 
beat Rumpel.

Junior forward Justin Selman 

capped the game’s scoring, beating 
Rumpel on his stick side and seal-
ing Michigan’s berth into a second-
round matchup against Michigan 
State on Friday.

“There have been some games 

in the past where we think we 
should’ve 
beaten 
(Michigan 

State),” Copp said. “It’s do or die.”

Added Hyman: “Playing State, 

and what happened with us last 
week, we still have that bitter taste 
in our mouth. We’re going to be 
ready to play tomorrow. There’s 
no bigger game than that. We’re 
going to get up for that.”

North Campus construction pro-
posals.

One 
included 
schematic 

designs for the North Cam-
pus Grove project, and granted 
the University authorization to 
award construction contracts for 
the renovation.

The existing North Campus 

lawn, which spans four acres 
and serves as the main outdoor 
gathering space on North Cam-
pus, will be improved to facilitate 
more opportunities for outdoor 
events, activities and displays.

University Planner Sue Gott 

said the project is essential in 
improving the North Campus 
atmosphere.

“As you know, this is a really 

sacred and iconic space for North 
Campus located in the heart of 
the core,” Gott said at the meet-
ing.

The renovations will create an 

informal amphitheater and add a 
new central plaza to the lawn, as 
well as walkways, seating, trees 
and improved lighting, water and 
electrical infrastructure.

In addition, Gott said the plan 

calls for a new sand volleyball 
court, built for both formal and 
informal recreation use, Wi-Fi, 
energy efficient lighting and a 
stormwater management system, 
which will absorb water that later 
moves into the Huron River.

The board approved the Grove 

project at their meeting last April; 
with Thursday’s approval, the 
design phase will move forward. 
Gifts and College of Engineering 
resources will fund the project.

The second item approved was 

a $13 million renovation of the 
North Campus Recreation Build-
ing, originally built in 1976. The 
project will add 18,000 square 
feet to the existing space — mak-
ing room for a new gymnasium, 
spaces for cardio and group exer-
cise and a new entry to the build-
ing.

In addition, the existing rac-

quetball courts, restrooms and 
locker rooms will be updated, 
along with electrical, heating and 
plumbing system upgrades.

The project’s design, which 

has been contracted to Integrated 
Design Solutions in association 
with RDG Planning and Design, 
will begin immediately.

The renovation is part of a larg-

er initiative to improve the Uni-
versity’s unions and recreational 
sports facilities.

In April 2013, the regents 

approved a $65-per-term student 
fee for facility renewal. The stu-
dent fee, which was administered 
to fund renovations of the Uni-
versity’s unions and recreational 
sports facilities, will fund the 
NCRB renovation.

Honorary degree recipient
The regents approved seven 

honorary degree recipients for 
the Spring 2015 Commencement, 
including Paul Saginaw and Ari 
Weinzweig. The duo will be this 
year’s commencement speakers, 
and are the co-founders of Zing-
erman’s Community of Business.

Zingerman’s Community of 

Businesses includes eight sepa-
rate businesses, employs over 600 
people and receives annual sales 
of close to $50 million. Saginaw 
and Weinzweig founded Zinger-
man’s Delicatessen in 1982 with a 
$20,000 bank loan.

President 
Barack 
Obama 

famously visited the deli last year 
and touted the company’s com-
mitment to responsible wages 
and benefits for employees.

“Zingerman’s is a business 

that treats its workers well, and 
rewards honest work with honest 
wages,” Obama told University 
students in a speech advocating 
higher federal minimum wage 
last spring. “And that’s worth cel-
ebrating.”

Former 
U.S. 
House 
Rep. 

John Dingell will also receive 
an honorary degree. Dingell is 
the longest-serving member of 
the House in history. During his 
tenure, he supported civil rights 
and progressive policies, voting 
for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
and the Affordable Care Act, and 
chairing the House Committee 
on Energy and Commerce.

In November 2014, Dingell 

earned the Presidential Medal 
of Freedom, the highest civilian 
award a U.S. citizen can win. His 
wife, Debbie Dingell, succeeded 
him when he retired from his 
post in January of this year.

Other honorary degree recipi-

ents include award-winning jour-
nalist Robin Wright, author and 
economist Robert Shiller and 
Tadataka Yamada, former chair 
of the Department of Internal 
Medicine.

“The seven individuals sub-

mitted for approval are remark-
able in their achievements and 
impacts on our society,” Univer-
sity President Mark Schlissel said 
at the meeting.

Central Student 

Government report

CSG President Bobby Dishell, 

a Public Policy senior, gave his 
monthly summary of CSG affairs 
to the regents.

He explained that, after talking 

with University administrators, 
changing the Fall 2015 academic 
calendar so classes would end 
prior to Dec. 23 is not a possibili-
ty. This issue was highly contest-
ed last month, when a student 
group called Crush the Calendar 
created a petition that amassed 
thousands of votes in support of 
rescheduling classes so students 
wouldn’t need to travel home on 
Christmas Eve.

Dishell also spoke about fur-

ther developing a student honor 
code, and discussed securing 
discounted football season ticket 
prices for students who qualify 
for financial aid.

His main point, though, was 

to reflect upon the University’s 
mental health resources.

“I’d like to apologize for mis-

stating an argument I have made 
to this board in the past,” he said. 
“Previously, I had stated that 
there is nothing else that more 
Michigan students participate in 
than Michigan football … I now 
know, upon reflection and look-
ing at data, that the single thing 
that affects most students, that 
most students go through on a 
day-to-day basis, is their mental 
well-being.”

Dishell said 36 percent of 

students at the University have 
had some form of mental health 
counseling in the last year, and 
added that 21 percent still do 
currently. He said that the sec-
ond leading cause of death for 
people aged 15 to 24 is suicide.

“The frightening thing about 

this statistic is that over 15,000 
of our students have sought help 
in the past year,” he said. “That 
means they are even more affect-
ed by mental health and depres-
sion day in and day out. I am one 
of these students. I battle with 
depression every day of my life … 
today I am winning that battle. I 
was able to get help, and I still do. 
I would not be here before you 
today if I hadn’t.”

Dishell 
asked 
the 
board 

to 
examine 
the 
University’s 

resources, including Counseling 
and Psychological Services and 
the Depression Center, to further 
examine ways to fight mental 
health stigma.

Speakers discuss 

divestment from fossil 

fuels, sexual misconduct
During the meeting’s public 

comments section, LSA senior 
Katelyn Maddock, a student 
representative from the Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Aware-
ness Center, asked the board to 
encourage faculty to include the 
University’s Student Sexual Mis-
conduct Policy in course syllabi.

Maddock said including the 

policy in syllabi would educate 
students about the sexual mis-
conduct resources available on 
campus and engage faculty in the 
discussion about sexual assault.

“We have an incredible need 

for language like this on cam-
pus,” Maddock said, citing the 
high number of sexual assaults 
reported on campus last year.

In 2014, the University had the 

second highest total number of 
reported sexual assaults on col-
lege campuses.

Citing the University’s respon-

sibility to combat climate change, 
Scott Bloomberg, a third-year 

law student and member of the 
Divest and Invest Campaign, was 
one of three to speak on behalf of 
the organization.

Bloomberg touted a resolution 

that Divest and Invest members 
co-authored with CSG represen-
tatives, which calls for a commit-
tee to investigate the University’s 
potential for divesting from oil 
and coal companies.

He said the resolution indi-

cated campus-wide support for 
the mission of Divest and Invest, 
and said the campaign’s success 
was at the very least grounds for 
a one-on-one private meeting 
with either the Board of Regents 
or Schlissel.

“I think we’ve earned enough 

to be able to meet with you all as 
a group and I think that’s what 
we’d like as a next step,” Bloom-
berg said. “From what I under-
stand you meet behind closed 
doors at least once a month 
before the meeting and I think 
we’d really like to be invited to 
that or be invited to give a pro-
longed speech here.”

Members of BAMN, a group 

that advocates for affirmative 
action, integration and immi-
grant rights, also spoke at the 
meeting

BAMN’s 
demands 
include 

calls for on-site admission pro-
grams 
and 
the 
“10-percent 

plan,” which has been adopted 
in Texas. Under this plan, the top 
10 percent of every in-state high 
school graduating class is guar-
anteed admission to any of the 
state’s public institutions.

LSA freshman Sandhya Meda-

puram — who is running to 
serve as a CSG representative 
for BAMN’s political branch, 
Defend Affirmative Action Party 
— said the organization would 
shut down another regents meet-
ing if the group’s demands for 
were not met.

“BAMN and our representa-

tives with CSG under the Defend 
Affirmative Action party, shut 
down the Regents meeting last 
semester over a discussion about 
on-site admissions in Detroit and 
we will do it again if our demands 
aren’t met,” Medapuram said.

She added that BAMN hopes 

to adjust the University’s admis-
sions 
processes 
to 
increase 

minority enrollment.

“The 
way 
the 
University 

approaches admissions is indubi-
tably racist and that’s what we’re 
targeting,” 
Medapuram 
said. 

“A campus that admits a larger 
(number of ) minority students 
will lead to a better representa-
tion of the state of Michigan, Ann 
Arbor, Detroit and the American 
society itself.”

Sugerman contributed reporting.

young musicians and supports 
numerous programs to help pro-
mote performing arts.

He earned Bachelors of Music 

and Masters of Music in Violin 
Performance degrees from the 
University.

In a written statement, Regent 

Andrea Fischer Newman (R) 
called Dworkin an “exciting out-
of-the-box appointment,” noting 
his insistence on “breaking new 
ground” would serve the school 
well.

University Provost Martha 

Pollack wrote in a statement that 
Dworkin would lead the school 
with integrity, energy and enthu-
siasm.

“His lifelong commitment to 

excellence in arts education is 
widely recognized in the U.S. and 
abroad,” Pollack wrote. “Aaron 
brings exceptional experience 
with organizational governance 
and a style that is collaborative, 
inclusive and pragmatic.”

Dworkin was Gov. Rick Sny-

der’s appointment to the Michi-
gan Council for Arts and Cultural 
Affairs.

“Aaron has an impressive his-

tory of leadership experience and 
is respected by many in the arts 
community of not only Michigan 
but also the nation. His commit-
ment to culture, diversity and 
learning will be a great benefit 
to the University of Michigan 
and I am confident students will 
accomplish great things under 
his direction,” Snyder wrote in a 
statement.

Dworkin will succeed Chris-

topher Kendall, who has held the 
deanship since 2005. The Uni-
versity limits deans to 10 years of 
service.

During his tenure, Kendall 

secured funding and helped 
design the expansion of the Earl 
V. Moore Building, re-instituted 
major ensemble and interna-
tional touring and campaigned 
for extensive scholarship fund-
ing for SMTD students. He will 
continue as a professor at the 
University in the Department of 
Conducting.

“Seeing that we’ve fostered a 

relationship for a years now, it 
would be helpful if the relation-
ship was more communicative 
on both sides,” Chamak said.

Business junior Alex Adler, 

the chair of Hillel’s governing 
board, said he would like CSG 
to work on facilitating connec-
tions amongst student leaders 
from different organizations.

He proposed creating a lead-

ership program, or combining 
pre-existing leadership devel-
opment workshops.

“Empowering and develop-

ing leadership is a big one for 
us,” Adler said.

He also identified the student 

assembly’s efforts to combat 
sexual assault on campus as a 
potential area for growth.

CSG joined the national cam-

pus sexual assault prevention 
campaign, It’s On Us, in Sep-
tember. The student assembly 
also partnered with I Will, a 
student-run 
campaign 
dedi-

cated to sexual assault preven-
tion, to create a specific pledge 

for University students where 
signers promised to empower 
sexual assault survivors and 
become allies.

CSG also collaborated on the 

I Will campaign to facilitate a 
workshop on sexual assault in 
November.

“We’d really like to see CSG 

continue to make the strides 
that they started to make this 
year but really push the conver-
sation and make sure it reaches 
across all of campus,” Adler 
said.

Business 
junior 
Maddy 

Walsh, Panhellenic Association 
president, wrote in an e-mail to 
the Daily that she spoke to the 
executive candidates from both 
parties and they made it clear to 
her they would like to work to 
unite the campus through vari-
ous initiatives.

She wrote she believed this 

was particularly important to 
her group because one of the 
association’s goals for the year 
is to increase collaboration with 
other student organizations.

“It will be great to have CSG 

as a facilitator, partner, and 
advocate for a connected cam-
pus,” Walsh stated.

a stay of the decision requested 
by Michigan Attorney General 
Bill Schuette (R). The legality of 
these marriages was reaffirmed 
in a court ruling Feb. 4.

In a press release Thurs-

day, the first of these couples 
to marry, Glenna DeJong and 
Marsha 
Caspar, 
said 
they 

believed the legislation would 
help their community.

“We’re members of a small, 

exclusive club of same-sex 
couples who were able to marry 
during a brief window on March 
22, 2014, but we don’t want to 
be,” DeJong said. “We want to 
be members of an inclusive club 
that welcomes any same-sex 
couple who wishes to marry.”

Though the Supreme Court 

will be ruling on same-sex leg-
islation, Irwin, a co-sponsor of 
one of the bills, said he believes 
that Michigan should get a head 
start in changing legislation 
toward being same-sex mar-
riage friendly.

“We’re calling for marriage 

equality, it’s something that 
is long overdue in the state of 
Michigan,” Irwin said. “We’re 
hopeful that the Supreme Court 
will rule in favor of marriage 
equality which would certain-
ly help in Michigan — it can’t 
come quick enough.”

The proposed package of leg-

islation consists of the legaliza-
tion of same-sex marriage and 
several other bills to address a 
variety of policy issues, includ-
ing whether adoption agencies 
can bar same-sex couples.

If successful, the bill will 

ban adoption agencies from dis-
crimination based on religious 
beliefs and will open the doors 
to many same-sex couples who 
are interested in adopting.

“I think that if there is a vet-

ted, qualified adult that is will-
ing to raise a child, then we 
shouldn’t have any obstacles 
for them to be able to raise the 
child here,” Wittenberg said. 
“We have a lot of kids in the 
foster care system here, and we 
want to make sure that they’re 

adopted and that they are taken 
by a loving family.”

The package of bills also 

addresses issues such as allow-
ing same-sex couples to file 
state taxes jointly. Another 
bill, sponsored by Wittenberg, 
allows any couple, including 
same-sex couples, to keep their 
marriage licenses private.

Wittenberg said he, along 

with the other representatives 
and senators who proposed 
bills, hope to work legislatively 
with Republicans to push these 
bills forward.

“We’re all working together, 

and we’re hoping to work with 
some of the Republicans across 
the aisle,” Wittenberg said. “We 
would love to take care of it leg-
islatively. We’re hoping that we 
wouldn’t have to go the ballot 
but if that’s what we need to do, 
then that’s what we need to do. 
We’re going to try to drum up 
the support of our Republican 
colleagues and get as many peo-
ple on board as possible, and try 
to talk to them about this being 
a fairness thing and equality.”

Republicans — who led the 

charge for passing the original 
ban in 2004 — have traditional-
ly been less inclined to support 
the legalization of same-sex 
marriage. Republican majori-
ties currently control both 
houses of the legislature, which 
could present a challenge for 
the bill’s backers.

In response to the package of 

bills, Gideon D’Assandro, spokes-
man for Speaker of the House 
Kevin Cotter, said the House 
hasn’t received the bills yet, but 
plans to address the package 
with the normal process.

“Once we actually receive 

the bills, we’re going to refer 
them 
to 
the 
committee,” 

D’Assandro said. “Then our 
plan is to let them go through 
the normal committee process, 
which is that they go to com-
mittee and then the committee 
chair determines when they get 
taken up for a hearing and what 
the timeline is.”

He added that he couldn’t 

comment further until the 
House formally receives the 
bills.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

D

uring this school year, 
unlike during others I’ve 
spent as a student at the 

University, 
I’ve 

found 
campus 

sentiment to be 
overwhelmingly 
shrouded 
in 

politically correct 
rhetoric. 
In 
an 

article regarding 
my 
connection 

to Judaism and 
Israel 
I 
wrote 

last 
October, 
I 

received 
two 

comments 
in 

which readers accused me of 
justifying the killing of 1,400 
Palestinians 
during 
Israel’s 

incursion in Gaza. This was in no 
way what I’d been arguing, and I 
believed the comments had been 
completely taken out of context, in 
order to confirm the readers’ biases 
that a Jewish student commenting 
on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
would always side with Israel.

In order to avoid any more mis-

conceptions, and frankly, in order to 
cover my ass, I rewrote the sentence 
that had prompted any accusations 
against my social consciousness. On 
a larger scale, this was a disturb-
ing reality to me. People reading a 
politically charged article often-
times take a somewhat ambiguous 
line from a piece and morph it into 
what they want it to mean in order 
to display their moral superiority.

In this day and age, social aware-

ness seems to have become a status 
symbol. All over the Internet, people 
post comments on media platforms 
that attempt to highlight an author’s 
lack of political correctness. But are 
these comments really attempting 
to educate the writer, or are they 
purely assuaging the commenter by 
publicly exposing what might seem 
to be evidence of moral superiority?

This is an omnipresent issue not 

only online, but also in conversations 
held on campus regarding racism, 
sexism, 
cultural 
appropriation, 

rape culture, etc. The social issues 

that hold such a deep significance 
in contemporary society are spoken 
about, but in such politically correct 
terminology that those who are 
unaware of certain realities are 
stifled from actually delving into 
conversation. Being called out is 
a powerful educational tool. But 
it should be done tactfully, rather 
than preached, because exposing 
someone’s 
ignorance 
oftentimes 

promotes an unnecessary power 
dynamic between those who are 
educated about an issue and those 
who are not.

Let us use Jesse Klein’s arti-

cle, 
“Relative 

Wealth,” as an 
example. 
Her 

piece was unin-
formed 
and 

offensive. How-
ever, did read-
ers think that 
her views were 
founded 
upon 

knowledge 
of 

economic 
dis-

parity in Amer-
ica? If so, they shouldn’t have. An 
article like hers was founded upon 
ignorance, and although I originally 
believed that the piece shouldn’t have 
been published, it garnered both 
harmful and beneficial responses. 
Personal attacks on Klein were made 
within the slew of 348 comments 
that she received. These, of course, 
were unnecessary and perfectly 
exemplify the use of a comment as a 
status symbol. A comment demean-
ing the writer, while highlighting 
one’s own sensibilities, is done self-
ishly. On the other hand, a response 
like Jenny Wang’s was completely 
appropriate in that it opened a forum 
for discussion, without admonish-
ing Klein. What Wang offered was 
perspective, which is truly the only 
teacher of social awareness.

After Klein read hurtful responses 

to her piece and experienced what I 
can only imagine was the inclination 
to regress into a hole for the rest of 
eternity, she bravely came out with 
another article, much more clearly 

articulating her original point. In her 
response piece, she wrote, “Online, 
my naïve perception of wealth was 
called the ‘Problem with America.’ 
In the real world, there are a lot of 
problems with America which, with 
any luck, can be fixed by learning 
from a few mistakes.”

So, Klein is an example of positive 

reformation after having been called 
out. Although her situation was 
extreme, the responses proved to be 
enlightening. But, what about the 
responses that were purely motivated 
by negativity and public recognition?

There is a clear argument for polit-

ical correctness 
and making the 
politically incor-
rect 
aware 
of 

their 
mistakes. 

But, 
as 
Klein 

pointed 
out, 

problems 
are 

fixed by learning 
from such mis-
takes. I’m proud 
of my University 
that in recent 

years, students have become much 
more aware of the social and politi-
cal issues that maintain inequality. 
But not everyone is aware of these 
realities, due to a lack of perspective. 
Ignorance, however, should not be 
confronted with judgment.

So, to those who are judgmental 

of the politically incorrect, be 
sensitive. To those who are unaware 
of the depths of social issues in 
America, educate yourself. A 600-
word Daily article written by a 
student in a social theory class isn’t 
going to educate you about white 
privilege. 
Expanding 
yourself 

beyond the familiar is what will.

Political correctness is a Band-

Aid — it assuages those who extend 
it, and it frightens those who don’t 
understand it. So hopefully the PC 
trend leaves us, and what replaces 
it is education, discussion and the 
search for perspective.

The border

I

was a newborn. Outside the 
house, the first one my parents 
had ever owned, sat the white 

stork: “Welcome 
home, 
David!” 

The 
door 
was 

freshly 
painted 

bright 
red, 
the 

grass just starting 
to 
become 
its 

impeccable green 
that early May. 
Down the street, 
on the corner of 
Mack 
Avenue, 

was 
the 
local 

grocery store, the 
Village Market, alongside a doctor’s 
office and a bank. This block of 
neatly lined houses was my whole 
world as a young child. A world that 
included little more than the arms 
of my mother I rested in, the yard 
I crawled in and the street I played 
on. My world was flat, and across 
that corner at the end of the street 
was the edge of the map.

I was seven. I had the new 

freedom of a bike and more energy 
than my mom could put up with 
inside my house, so I discharged 
it by pedaling around. I rode to 
friends’ houses, to the park, to 
baseball games. If my wheels 
could carry me there, I went there. 
Everywhere, that is, except across 
Mack. When I hit Mack or Alter 
Drive, I reached the end of my ride 
in that current direction. I had 
reached the edge of the map.

This was no rule anyone told me. 

No signs were posted. You hit Mack 
or Alter and you turn left or you 
turn right. There was no straight.

These streets are the border of my 

bubble of a town and Detroit. This 
is where the suburb meets the city. 
Where the neat rows of houses and 
lawns give way to a neighborhood 
of blocks with abandoned homes, 
overgrown grass and charred wood 
left behind from a structure gone 
up in flames, neglected roads that 
haven’t been repaved in years. This 
is not the downtown Detroit of 

renaissance and revival; this is the 
rawness of the outskirts, the real-
ness of the desolation, the reality 
of the economic and racial divide 
that relegated the city into ceaseless 
recession. If you go straight through 
those border streets into the city, 
you risk popping the bubble.

I was 13. I wore a basketball uni-

form emblazoned with a falcon on it, 
the mascot of my parish. Our church 
was on Mack Avenue, my team 
a mix of kids 
from either side 
of that street. I 
had grown up 
in a completely 
homogenous 
school 
on 
my 

side of street, 
and here I was 
on my first team 
that 
didn’t 
fit 

this 
uniform 

lack of diversity 
I knew. The thought never crossed 
my mind; the new uniform was the 
one we wore. The team won every 
game that season.

I was 16. It was a cold December 

Saturday morning, trunk of the car 
loaded up with bags of gifts piled 
all the way to the roof. We stopped 
at the light on Mack and drove 
through. We stopped at houses with 
porch steps crumbled in disrepair, 
houses 
neighboring 
boarded-up 

properties and at doors with iron 
bars across them. We walked into 
homes with the gifts and bags of 
food; homes with families and 
children 
who 
decorated 
their 

houses for the holidays the best 
they could, ecstatic, cheerful and 
thankful. I had left the bubble 
to go over to where I once would 
never venture and found that the 
human spirit is identical in the most 
opposite of places and situations.

It’s easy to see the border as a 

statistic of inequality, as a line of 
socioeconomic divide, as a contrast 
of black and white and of different 
hues of lifestyles. Long and com-
plicated history has created these 

invisible walls. The same history 
has caused us to forget that the 
other side is filled with the same 
human emotions, the same lives 
and the same desires, only trans-
formed across a couple of streets. 
The suburb forgets that the people 
merely across the street deserve 
the same good education, the same 
safe streets and the same privileges 
because they are people. The dif-
ference of socioeconomic status 

and tax revenue 
is 
merely 
the 

result of the sys-
tematic societal 
inequality that 
is 
evident 
all 

around, 
some-

times 
blocks 

away.

I’m now 20. 

Some 
things 

move 
forward, 

like 
the 

gorgeous, brand new baseball field 
built where cracked and abandoned 
tennis courts once decayed a mere 
two blocks from the border. Others 
hinder any progress: a fatal shooting 
a block north of the new field, and 
another shooting merely a week 
earlier of four kids from across the 
border, right before Christmas; one 
lost her life. There are problems 
that cannot be fixed with simple 
solutions. 
The 
border 
remains 

dangerous, a stark juxtaposition 
and symbol of a world riddled with 
inequity, the bubble suburb trying 
to escape from this reality for years 
until it realizes that the bubble it 
subsists in is only figurative.

I was lucky to be encouraged 

to explore, to learn that there is 
no 
graffiti-filled 
concrete 
wall 

between the cities that must come 
down. Instead there exist walls of 
a different kind, walls that society 
has built up for years; we sometimes 
fail to notice they exist. These 
walls, too, must be torn down.

n September 2014, the Daily requested documents from the 
University surrounding the Department of Education’s Title IX 
investigation, falling under the purview of Michigan’s Freedom 

of Information Act. These documents include, “written complaints, 
e-mails from administrators and witness statements, among other 
documents.” After negotiations and communication spanning over 
four months, the Daily paid one of two $445 installments for a 
fraction of the originally requested documents. Two months later, 
the University has not only failed to provide the documents, but 
also has not released a timeline estimating when it might provide 
them. This is not acceptable. Although the University is not legally 
required to release any sort of timeline, Frank LoMonte, executive 
director of the Student Press Law Center, said in an interview with 
the Daily that this process “really should not take months.” While 
not illegal, it is unethical and dubious of the University to decline 
releasing a timeline in addition to the documents themselves.

Unfortunately, this failure of the University 

to make records available to the public is 
consistent with past behavior. In 2011, the 
Daily published a special report showing that 
the University charges hefty fees for open 
records requests, which sometimes can be 
well over $1,000 — far more expensive than 
fees charged by other Big Ten schools.

Not only does the University make 

the attainment of documents under the 
purview of FOIA difficult by hiking up 
the fees for document requests, but it also 
lacks an official policy for preserving public 
records. The legality and morality of this is 
questionable, if not doubtful. This problem 
emerged earlier this academic year, when the 
Daily submitted FOIA requests for e-mails 
to and from former Athletic Director Dave 
Brandon 
immediately 
following 
former 

football kicker Brendan Gibbons’ permanent 
separation from the University for violating 
the Student Sexual Misconduct Policy. In 
this case, the University could not fulfill the 
request because the e-mails — which are 
public record — had been deleted due to the 
lack of a records retention policy.

These problems find their origins in both 

systemic practices within the University 
and in the details of the state’s FOIA 
requirements. The Michigan Freedom of 
Information Act requires the public body to 
respond to requests for documents within 
five business days, but this response can 
simply state that more time is needed before 
the documents can be released. It does not, 
however, require the public body to specify 
exactly how much time is needed.

In addition, the bill states that public bodies 

may charge requesters fees “for the necessary 
copying of a public record for inspection 
or providing a copy of a public record,” and 
that they may charge additional fees if not 
doing so would result in “unreasonably high 
costs” for the public body. These terms are 
vague and ultimately give public bodies the 
discretion to determine the cost of obtaining 
the requested documents. This ambiguous 
legislation could have led to the unreasonably 
high costs demanded of the Daily.

Fortunately, 
earlier 
this 
year 
the 

Michigan legislature passed changes to the 
bill, effective July 1, that will amend these 
problems. Such changes require public 
bodies to release a timeline, albeit non-
binding, for the documents’ release, and 
also cap fees at 10 cents per page prepared 
for release.

Although these changes are commendable, 

the problem still remains: the University is 
not being transparent about its practices and 
procedures. Even though their practices are 
not currently illegal, withholding information 
from the public and from students is morally 
concerning, regardless of whether it be 
because the records are poorly organized or 
the records reveal incriminating information.

In light of all of these events, it is absolutely 

imperative — for ethical reasons and for 
the sake of re-earning students’ trust — for 
the University to provide the documents, 
or at least a timeline for the release of the 
documents that were requested two months 
ago, with or without legislation mandating 
the University do so.

Unsurprising behavior

University has failed to provide documents requested through FOIA

FROM THE DAILY

There are problems 
that cannot be fixed 
with simple solutions.

NATHANIEL MACANIAN | VIEWPOINT

Awaken Ann Arbor

When was the last time you took a second 

to reflect? From the day we step into our 
freshman dorm rooms, we’re taught that 
college students should be busy, booked and 
stressed from the moment they wake up to 
the moment they fall asleep. Here in Ann 
Arbor, we especially feel a need to maximize 
all of the great resources Ann Arbor has to 
offer, oftentimes sacrificing our personal 
comforts and mental health in the process. 
Ultimately, what these self-induced pressures 
often result in is a tunnel-vision view of our 
real priorities.

Few are aware of the biological benefits of 

engaging in meditation. Studies conducted at 
the University of North Carolina and Wake 
Forest University concluded that mindfulness 
techniques consistently displayed improved 
cognitive abilities, and even higher GRE 
scores. Additionally, MRI studies have 
shown that enlarged hippocampal and right 
orbito-frontal regions in meditators were 
associated with enhanced memory capacity 
and affective experience, as well as emotional 
regulating abilities.

Meditation and Zen habits are gaining more 

traction in our culture every day, and for good 
cause. Other similar studies have shown that 
meditating 20 minutes for just four days result-

ed in improved test scores than control groups.

Big questions are hard to answer and 

even harder to ask. Awaken Ann Arbor is a 
relatively new student organization dedicated 
to helping students learn how to meditate, 
find a more meaningful purpose in their lives, 
and grow spiritually without emphasizing 
dogma. Awaken’s weekly meetings aim to 
foster a more spiritually minded student body 
on campus, and offer a community of like-
minded individuals to learn from sharing 
meaningful life experiences every week.

These processes are a workout for your 

brain, and getting started is the hardest 
part. Awaken Ann Arbor provides certified 
instructors who guide group meditation 
sessions for all levels, and the dialogues that 
follow connect students with the knowledge 
and resources needed to help maximize our 
potential here at the University of Michigan.

All ages, skills, and perspectives are 

encouraged to join us at Awaken’s meetings 
every Sunday at 12 p.m.

‘Last Man on Earth’ 
has unique premise

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

When “The Last Man on 

Earth” was announced last year, 
they hadn’t even filmed a pilot. 
FOX picked up 
the idea straight-
to-series 
with 

only a loose idea 
and Will Forte 
(“Saturday Night 
Life”) 
attached 

to 
star 
and 

write the series. 
Upon presenting 
the 
show 
to 

advertisers 
in 

May, they had 
only a video of 
Forte performing solitary 
activities — singing the National 
Anthem to an empty Dodgers 
Stadium and getting food from an 
empty grocery store, among other 
things. That added up to a series 
with an amount of promise, but 
even more uncertainty. However, 
upon watching the first three 
episodes, it’s clear the network’s 
risk has been rewarded. Over 
the course of these episodes, the 
comedy displayed some growing 
pains, but it also showed great 
potential.

“The Last Man on Earth,” 

which counts “21 Jump Street” 
directors Phil Lord and Chris 
Miller 
among 
its 
executive 

producers, follows Phil Miller 
(Forte), the titular last man on 
Earth after a virus wipes out the 
rest of the planet’s population. It 
portrays the hijinks that ensue 
and how he lives his life as the 
only person in the world. At the 
end of the pilot, the show expands 
its world by introducing Kristen 
Schaal (“Bob’s Burgers”) as Carol, 

the last woman on Earth, and the 
second and third episodes of the 
show feature her interactions 
with Phil. 

The best aspect of “The Last 

Man on Earth” is how it generates 
the show’s inherently one-man 
comedy style. His activities are 
absurd, yet always enjoyable 
to watch. The first episode is 
almost entirely made up of things 
like playing racquetball on the 
presidential seal, creating a Jenga 
tower that would put anyone else’s 
to shame and going bowling with 
a truck and a queue of fishtanks. 
Forte plays each of these scenes so 
casually, adding to each moment’s 
level of humor. While this idea on 
its own is not enough to sustain a 
TV series (which is likely why they 
introduced Schaal’s character), 
it’s the best part of the show.

What’s more problematic is 

Schaal’s character. They bring 
her into the world to add a foil 
for Forte to play off of, however, 
they go slightly too far with this. 
Her first episode (the show’s 
second) is the worst of the three 

because Carol isn’t given any 
sort of nuance. She is OCD to the 
extreme and follows the rules of 
the “regular world” with constant 
rigidity (like stopping at stop 
signs), and perfectly juxtaposes 
Phil’s messiness and complete 
neglect of the rules. Schaal is 
directed to turn up the volume of 
her performance to full blast, and 
it just comes off as obnoxious. Her 
second episode does a lot better 
by the character. It gives her more 
notes to play with her wedding to 
Phil. 

“Last Man on Earth” is the type 

of show that network executives 
should make more often. It has 
an incredibly weird premise, 
but in the hands of an actor 
like Forte and writers like Lord 
and Miller, it turned out to be 
highly entertaining. Sometimes 
in television programming, it’s 
worth investing in a risky premise 
because of a belief that it could 
be strong. Even if the show had 
some rough growing pains, as 
many sitcoms do, it’s a show that’s 
engaging and worth watching.

GENDER AND MEDIA COLUMN

Why isn’t Will 
Smith a cougar?

A

s I write this column 
(in my Economics class, 
as my professor stares 

at me expectantly, assuming 
I will know 
the answer 
to something 
I don’t), I’ve 
officially 
been on 
Earth 20 
years, three 
months, 
30 days, 11 
hours and 42 
minutes. And 
it took the 
same brainpower to calculate 
that that it would have to do my 
Econ homework. 

Age is just a number, right? 

A number broken down into 
smaller numbers and more 
finite definitions until it has no 
meaning. It’s why I get along 
better with my mom’s friends 
than my own. Age is just a 
number — until it’s not.

Watching the trailer for 

“Focus,” the sleek and sexy 
con movie starring Will Smith 
and Margot Robbie, I couldn’t 
even get past the first few 
moments without rolling my 
eyes. I didn’t see the movie 
— by all accounts it could be 
funny or charming or smart. 
But I just couldn’t watch 
46-year-old Will Smith take 
24-year-old Robbie under his 
wing, showing her the ways 
of the con world and maybe 
falling a little in love. I couldn’t 
stop thinking, “Why is that 
allowed?” 

Why are we, as an intelligent 

audience, asked to suspend 
our disbelief when it comes 
to the age difference between 
onscreen love interests? It was 
the case in “Sabrina” 60 years 
ago – a daddy-issue-laden 
Audrey Hepburn was 25 while 
her counterpart Humphrey 
Bogart was 55 — and it still 
happens all the time today. 
Whether it’s part of the plot, as 
“Focus” attempts with Smith 
and Robbie’s veteran/novice 
relationship, or not, it seems we 
find it OK when men in movies 
are AARP cardholders and 
their girls barely out of braces. 

Cursory research into this 

disparity holds true, even 
with award-winning movies. 
Bradley Cooper was 15 years 
older than Jennifer Lawrence 
when they fell in bizarre love in 
“Silver Linings Playbook.” (And 
now Bradley is dating a model 
17 years his junior, which begs 

the question: is Bradley Cooper 
kind of a skeeze?) Woody 
Allen’s entire repertoire, 
including last year’s “Magic in 
the Moonlight,” features the 
perfunctory objectification 
of younger muses. It’s clear a 
director has a problem when 
the onscreen relationship 
between Emma Stone (25) and 
Colin Firth (54) barely bats an 
eye among audiences. 

Search “age difference in 

film” on Wikipedia and the list 
of films featuring older men 
with younger women is more 
than three times the length of 
its reverse, older women with 
younger men. A vast age gap 
between a wrinkled man and 
rosy-cheeked girl is often not 
even addressed in the plot of 
a film — it’s just something 
we’ve come to expect in a 
patriarchal society. In contrast, 
when a woman is older than 
a man in a movie, you betcha 
the word cougar comes up. 
The Wikipedia list alone is 
laughable, featuring titles like 
“Cougar Club,” “My Teacher’s 
Wife,” and “Caught” — these 
movies are defined by this 
illicit age difference. What 
does the other side have? Oscar 
winners and box office hits. 

When women are older 

they are often represented as 
unstable cougars, desperately 
clinging to their youth or 
fading self image — the 
infamous Mrs. Robinson in 
“The Graduate” comes to mind. 
Or they are lonely women just 
making a mistake, reclaiming 
their sexuality — J.Lo as the 
teacher gone rogue in “The Boy 
Next Door.” This is a decided 
type in film, a persona at the 
forefront of a script. Older men 
are rarely defined by their age 
in reference to their younger 
love interest, unless they 
literally are predators. We all 
know “Lolita” and shudder, 
but Keira Knightley was only 
19 when she and Jack Sparrow 
had their almost-tryst in 
“Pirates of the Caribbean,” and 
no one ever talks about that in 
hushed tones.

I know it may seem as 

though I’m grasping for straws, 
but there is a real discrepancy. 
And it matters. Men are 
valued for their strength, their 
experience, their confidence; 
all traits that grow with age. 
Women are valued first and 
foremost for their beauty, and 
then their spontaneity, that 
fresh, fleeting ingénue quality. 

We are afraid for women 

to get old. That’s it. Men can 
age with dignity and humor, 
developing distinguished gray 
hair and endearing laugh lines. 
As men in Hollywood age they 
become wiser, mellower, less 
inhibited. Women don’t have 
that luxury — in real life that’s 
why those who have the means 
so often turn to plastic surgery, 
and in Hollywood that’s why 
26-year-olds are hired to fill a 
role better suited thematically 
for a 40-year-old. Meryl Streep 
was once quoted saying, “When 
I turned 40, I got 3 different 
witch scripts in one year.” 
That’s fucked up. (And to note, 
that was 10 years after Streep 
played a divorced woman 
replaced by an 18-year-old in 
Woody Allen’s “Manhattan.”)

Female actresses, both young 

and old, deserve better. The 
Margot Robbies of Hollywood 
deserve to be offered roles in 
which their sex symbol sta-
tuses aren’t salient character 
traits. They shouldn’t always 
be the targets of skewed power 
dynamics, a plaything for 
an older man. Older women 
deserve roles that recognize 
their age (and not in a negative 
way) while still valuing them 
as living, breathing, loving 
human beings. That’s not to say 
that age difference shouldn’t 
be used as a storytelling device 
— it’s important that movies 
do recognize when age plays a 
role in character decisions or 
behaviors. But this needs to be 
conscious, and should reflect 
dynamics actually present in 
the world.

My mom is four years older 

than my dad, and growing up it 
was always a thing. There were 
usually jokes at parties about 
Mary, the cougar. Not that it 
really bothered my mom – she 
was too busy living her god-
damn life to let something like 
that irritate her. But it always 
intrigued me. Would there have 
been the jokes if my dad were 
older? Movies are often an 
inflated reflection on real life, 
in this issue especially. I want 
to live in a world where no one 
comments on my parent’s age 
difference, unless those same 
people also call into question 
an even more exaggerated age 
difference like that in “Focus.”

Movie experiences 
change with company

By CONRAD FOREMAN

Daily Arts Writer

The experience you have 

watching 
a 
movie 
changes 

depending on whom you watch 
it with.

That may seem extremely 

reductive, but I believe it’s true, 
and I believe it’s a beautiful 
truth. Think about it: Whether 
your watch a movie alone, 
or with family or friends, 
the film doesn’t change, but 
your perception of the film 
can 
change 
significantly. 

The reason why is fairly self-
explanatory: Different groups 
create 
different 
dynamics, 

which affect your perception 
of everything around you, and 
thus your perception of the 
movie.

Let’s look at an example. I 

like “Dazed and Confused” as 
a movie. It’s fine. But it’s 100 
times better when I watch it 
with my two friends that can 
quote the entire film. Their 
enjoyment inspires me to find 
pleasure from the same source. 
“The Goods: Live Hard, Sell 
Hard” offered me a similar 
experience. 
Enjoyment 
is 

contagious — as is disapproval.

An example on the opposite 

end of the spectrum, for me, is 
“22 Jump Street.” Walking out 
of the theater after that movie, 

I felt very negatively about it, to 
the point that I believe perhaps 
my reaction (and review) was 
too harsh. However, the two 
friends I saw it with also hated 
it, and my negative perception 
was reaffirmed walking out of 
the theater, so until I experience 
“22 Jump Street” in another 
way, it will also have a sour 
taste for me. The same goes for 
“The Curious Case of Benjamin 
Button,” which I saw with a 
friend who was determined to 
enjoy the film. He was so sure 
that I would like the movie that 
he promised I could kick him 
in the balls if I didn’t. After 
that, there was no chance I was 
going to enjoy “Ben Button.” To 
this day I think of “Benjamin 
Button” as a three-hour bore-
fest. I’ll never know exactly 
how much that opinion has 
to do with the circumstances 
under which I first saw the film, 
but my money’s on a lot.

As a member of the FilmSquad 

at The Michigan Daily, I fancy 
myself something of a movie 
buff, as do my peers. Each of 
us often holds strong opinions 
about certain films. For each of 
us, the films we love and hate 
are different. Sometimes we 
disagree strongly about a film, 
which speaks to the beautiful 
truth to which I referred at the 
beginning of the article: There 

is no objective standard for art.

To me, it seems objectively 

obvious that “Birdman” is a 
unique, brilliant film in every 
way — acting, cinematography, 
soundtrack, narrative, etc. But 
even this year’s Best Picture 
winner 
proves 
divisive 
for 

some. My father summed up 
“Birdman” 
as 
“Hollywood 

making fun of stage people 
making fun of Hollywood, and 
underneath it all is the fact 
that (Michael) Keaton played 
Batman a couple times.” This 
is blasphemy to me, but how 
can I say that anyone is wrong 
in their judgment about a piece 
for which there is no objective 
grading scale?

I know that what I’ve said 

here isn’t groundbreaking, nor 
particularly original. I just 
wanted to take the opportunity 
to use the platform I have 
through the Daily to point out 
some important obvious things 
about movies. Any movie can be 
enjoyed, no matter how shitty; 
all you have to do is watch it 
in the right environment, with 
the right people. Any movie 
can be hated, no matter how 
masterful. 

Maybe 
the 
real 
point 
is 

that words like “shitty” and 
“masterful” aren’t appropriate 
to describe a film — only the 
experience of watching the film.

TV REVIEW

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
Meaning of the bow

By BAILEY KADIAN

For The Daily

It’s time. The lights dim, the 

audience roars and it’s your 
turn to greet them. You are 
no longer the character they 
watched, but yourself, walking 
toward center stage to face all 
who watched you. You have 
waited for this moment for 
quite some time, and you are 
ready to receive the praise that 
they are eager to give you. 

The 
bow 
calls 
for 
an 

abandonment of your character. 
The rule that demands “you 
must never break character” 
is dismissed for this moment 
and the audience sees you just 
as you are. The fourth wall is 
gone, and now there is nothing 
separating 
you 
from 
your 

character. The character you 
were has been exchanged for 
reality, and your audience now 
recognizes you as you. Your 
first steps toward center stage 
make you realize that this is 
your moment to acknowledge 
them face-to-face.

Initially, you think they’re 

thanking you. Their praise 
indicates to you that your 
audience is grateful for your 
entertainment, 
for 
your 

emotions, for your story. You 
gave them all they needed to 
engage in an alternate world 
with alternate characters and 

now you bow to accept their 
appreciation. As the cheering 
continues and you scan the 
crowd, you realize this bow 
means more to you than others 
would think. Is your bow only 
an exchange of your audience’s 
gratitude toward you? Or does 
this bow initiate a catharsis of 
your own? 

As 
an 
actor, 
you 
work 

every moment of every day 
to produce something that 
an audience will love. You 
work to eventually see that 
your 
audience 
approves 
of 

the story you have told them 
and appreciate what has been 
communicated. However, your 
bow does not work entirely 
one way. There is an equal 
exchange of thanks from the 
audience to the performer, as 
well as from the performer 
to the audience. Your bow is 
a form of submission to your 
audience. You see it as your way 

of telling them that the effort 
you put towards every second 
of rehearsal, and will continue 
to put towards your art, is for 
them. With that commitment, 
you submit everything you are 
to become a character for them 
to grow with and relate to. 

With this bow you say:
Thanks to you, audience, 

because you are why I do what 
I do. Thanks to you, because 
your very applause confirms 
to me that the hours I spent 
rehearsing 
lines, 
learning 

blocking, 
running 
numbers 

and sacrificing time was worth 
it. Thanks to you, audience, 
because your praise eliminates 
my uncertainty towards my art 
and my fear and anxiousness 
towards defeat. You are the 
reason I wake up every day 
inspired by a character that I 
must become. I realize at this 
moment that my art produces 
a feeling of utter contentment, 
and you are here to witness it. 
As I stand here at center stage 
to be thanked by you, I truly 
owe you the thanks. If I didn’t 
see you here in front of me 
clapping and smiling, I wouldn’t 
be doing what I love. My life 
without theater would not be 
fulfilling, so a thanks to you all, 
because with this bow, I accept 
the challenges that will come, 
and I will graciously accept the 
satisfaction of this moment.

I will graciously 

accept the 

satisfaction of 
this moment.

SUMMER EMPLOYMENT

Under current 

staff, defensive line 
coach still feels at 
home at Michigan

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

In Greg Mattison’s 37th year 

of coaching, at his 11th program, 
there’s plenty of reason for him 
to be unsatisfied with the role 
of defensive line coach.

Or, 
knowing 
the 

opportunities he had in the 
off-season, 
to 
want 
to 
be 

somewhere else. There’s a new 
head coach, a new defensive 
coordinator and a new role — a 
smaller role.

But Mattison is just fine in 

his second stint at Michigan.

“I feel very fortunate to 

be able to stay at Michigan,” 
Mattison said. “I love Michigan, 
and I feel very strongly about 
the players coming back and 
the guys in this program, and I 
feel very strongly about Coach 
(Jim) Harbaugh. I’ve known 
that family for a long time, and 
it’s just great to be back.”

Mattison 
worked 
under 

Harbaugh’s father, Jack, at 
Western Michigan from 1982-
1986, first as a defensive line 
coach and then as a defensive 
coordinator. Now, he’s back on 
another Harbaugh staff.

When Harbaugh came to 

Michigan, he hired D.J. Durkin 
from Florida to take over the 
defensive 
coordinator 
post 

Mattison had held for four 
years 
under 
former 
coach 

Brady Hoke. Durkin is also the 
linebackers coach.

Then 
Harbaugh 
asked 

Mattison, 
the 
Super 
Bowl-

winning defensive coordinator, 
to stay on staff as a defensive 
line coach.

“I’ve coached defensive line 

my whole life,” Mattison said. 
“You can get guys to be better. 
You can make improvements 
there through technique and 
through hard work.”

Still, it was a demotion, 

essentially, for an accomplished 
coach who could have gone 
somewhere else.

“I had a number of offers, 

some in the NFL and things 
like that,” Mattison said. “But I 
made up my mind that if I had 
the opportunity, I’d love to stay, 
and I did. So I stayed.”

The reason was sentimental, 

just like when he left the 
Baltimore 
Ravens 
the 
first 

time to join Hoke’s staff. It 
was Michigan, the place he 
has coached at least four years 
longer than each of the other 
10 stops. And it was under 
Harbaugh, 
who had won 
in college and 
in 
the 
NFL 

and 
whom 

he 
knew 

personally.

Thursday, 

he 
had 

nothing 
but 

positive 
things to say 
about 
his 

new role: no complaints, no 
interference, not a backhanded 
comment toward the new staff.

“Not at all,” Mattison said. 

“I really respect the guy I’m 
working with and the guys I’m 
working with. I’ve done that for 
so long that sometimes you say, 
it’s kind of enjoyable just to take 
these four guys and see how 
good they can be.

“I knew that when Jim 

hired me. There’s only one 
coordinator, and what he says, 
we do. Once you get that, you 
say, ‘OK, my job now is to 
coordinate the defensive line 
and to do a great job with that.’ 
I’ve done it so long and I’ve had 
so many opportunities to do it, 
it’s about really just seeing how 
good we can get this team.”

So after four years under 

Hoke, Mattison came back to 
finish what he started. After 
all, only one of their recruiting 
classes has made it all the way 
through.

But he would object to the 

term “finish.”

“I don’t know if it’s to finish, 

because when you’re finished 
you say it’s over,” Mattison said. 
“I just wanted to stay a part 
of what Michigan is and what 
Michigan will be and what 
Michigan has been forever.

“I think that’s coming. I want 

to be a part of that, and I’m 
fortunate to be a part of it.”

He 
also 

served 
as 
a 

stabilizing 
force 
during 

a tumultuous 
offseason 
with 
the 

coaching 
transition. 
When 
players 
had 

the 
chance 

to leave the 

program for a fresh start, 
unsure of the new coach, 
Mattison kept the ship steady.

“The message was, ‘Hey, this 

is Michigan. You came here 
because it’s Michigan. Don’t be 
thinking about doing anything 
else. You’re staying here. It’s 
going to work out. Everything’s 
going to be good,’ ” he said. 
“And that’s the only thing I’ve 
ever said to them.”

It worked.
“It tells you that you recruit 

the right guys,” Mattison said. 
“And they’re Michigan guys.”

He has many of them back 

for his fifth season, and once 
again, Mattison is standing 
behind them. He didn’t have to, 
but he’s along for one more ride 
after all.

EVENT PREVIEW
Men! Men! Men! a 
dissection of gender

By GRACE HAMILTON

Daily Arts Writer

A fetishized bicycle, spiked 

high heels, decadent strings of 
pearls and football uniforms 
will 
decorate 

six 
dancers 

as 
they 
poke 

and 
twist 

our 
concept 

of 
gender. 

The 
hourlong 

program, 
“Men! 
Men! 

Men!” curated 
by 
Thurnau 

Professor 
of Dance Peter Sparling, is 
a 
complement 
to 
UMMA’s 

exhibition 
of 
the 
Hergott 

Shepard 
Photography 

Collection. 

The 
world-acclaimed 

collection, 
running 
through 

June at the museum with 
Mario 
Codognato 
as 
guest 

curator, 
focuses 
on 
the 

concept of masculinity and the 
complexity of male identity in 
contemporary society. Nadine 
Hubbs, Professor of Women’s 
studies and Music, and MFA 
student 
Michael 
Parmelee 

assisted in the curation of 
“Men! Men! Men!” 

Sparling, who has been at 

the University for the last 30 
years, made a name for himself 
by integrating dance with the 
visual arts, sciences, video 
and 
other 
creative 
media, 

establishing 
a 
long-standing 

relationship with UMMA. 

Sparling sent out a call for 

students 
to 
consider 
what 

it 
meant 
to 
explore 
male 

identities. 
He 
received 
six 

enthusiastic responses, from 
four current students and two 
alumni. The dancers are Maddy 
Rager and Chris Sies, Marcus 
White, 
Michael 
Parmelee 

and Amy Guilmette, Anthony 
Alterio and Tru Yunkman. 

“One of the alums, Amy 

Guilmette, 
responded 

immediately after I sent the call 
saying ‘you know, this makes 
me think of how I have always 

felt that I am a seven-year-
old boy in a woman’s body,’” 
Sparling said. 

Each piece will bravely tell a 

different story, like this one.

“If people are shocked or 

offended, that’s their problem. 
I kind of hope that some people 
are. I want, and the performers 
want, to jostle people out of 
their complacency,” Sparling 
said. 

Undoubtedly, 
the 

performance will be a spectacle. 
He describes several of the 
highlights to provide a sense 
of its range: Tru Yunkman 
uses dance to transform from 
woman 
to 
man, 
Michael 

Parma Lee explores sexuality 
through his dialogue with a 
bicycle and Maddy Rager and 
her 
percussionist 
partner, 

Chris Sies, will wear football 
uniforms from the high school 
her father teaches at, in a duet 
usually performed in baroque 
costume. 

Curating moving bodies is 

different than curating stationary 
objects, like paintings or photos. 

“In curating a performance, 

I think about whether there is 
a common thread throughout, 
or whether there isn’t, and how 
to maximize juxtapositions so 
that contrasts come forward and 
it doesn’t all blend together,” 
Sparling said. “So how do you 
arrange the trajectory so that you 
get the most impact out of the 
whole cumulative effect?”

Modern dance has had an 

important role in addressing social 
and political themes for decades. 
Recently, dance has partnered 
more frequently with other kinds 

of art and within performance art 
to address complicated issues, like 
gender, tying itself more closely to 
politics. 

“In more and more cultural 

theory, 
the 
moving 
dancing 

body is being considered as a 
text to be read about everything 
and anything in its culture and 
environment,” Sparling said. 

“Here at U of M and in the 

broader field of dance, we’re 
really looking at contemporary 
dance as a barometer for the way 
that people react and behave and 
how their bodies and motions 
tell everything about how they 
project their identity within a 
culture.” 

Sparling has a strong belief 

in the unique power of moving 
bodies to affect people deeply in 
a way that other forms of art, like 
text and even photographs, which 
can act as filters, cannot. 

“Dance cuts through to a 

part of the brain that reacts and 
responds 
viscerally. 
There’s 

something immediate about a live 
body in the same space you’re in. 
It’s dangerous!” he said. 

The pieces will be performed 

in the old wing of the museum, 
within the apse, without the 
familiar safety of stage. This 
proximity is a personal invitation 
to audience members to step 
outside of their comfort zones and 
engage with the questions raised 
before them. 

“Hopefully, people are at an 

age (and at a place of learning) 
where they want to learn about 
themselves. And of course, at the 
ages of 18 to 25, it’s a hot time to 
try and figure out who in the hell 
you are. So why not be engaged 
and challenge yourself to think 
about these things like gender 
identity?” Sparling said, appealing 
to students. 

“Men! Men! Men!” exemplifies 

the role of contemporary dance, 
pushing 
the 
boundaries 
of 

art, convention, space, bodies 
themselves 
and 
audience 

members. 
While 
the 
pieces 

themselves will step outside of 
the box, audience members will 
be required to do so as well.

Penalty kill lifts 
Michigan to win

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

With 9:22 to go in the game 

and momentum suddenly in 
Wisconsin’s favor, the Michigan 
hockey team knew it had a job 
to do.

Junior forward Andrew Copp, 

sophomore forward JT Compher 
and senior defenseman Brennan 
Serville took the ice for 1:03 of 
5-on-3 hockey. After allowing 
a goal just moments before, the 
Badger fans in Joe Louis Arena 
rose to their feet in anticipation.

“With five minutes to go, we 

were knocking on the door with 
a power play,” said Wisconsin 
coach Mike Eaves. “Realistically 
we’re hoping that we get a second 
goal and make a go of it. They got 
two late goals, and that was the 
difference.”

Every 
time 
a 
hint 
of 

momentum swung toward the 
Badgers, the Wolverines were 
quick to earn it back. Copp 
won the faceoff in Michigan’s 
zone and delivered the puck to 
Compher, who skated the length 
of the ice, fired a shot and quieted 
the suddenly awake fans.

“I said, ‘We’re fine here. We’ve 

got 10 (minutes left), up two.’ ” 
Copp said. “We were pretty calm 
and collected on the bench; not a 
lot of freaking out there.”

Michigan was able to kill 

the 
penalty, 
drawing 
the 

largest cheers of the night. In 
the minutes that followed, the 
Wolverines played their best 
hockey of the night, securing two 
late goals in the 5-1 win.

The penalty kill in the third 

period was one of Michigan’s six 
in the game — including four in 
the tense third period — but what 
came off of each kill proved to 
be the most important. Despite 
a sluggish start and an offense 
that seemed out of sync for much 
of the game, the Wolverines 
were able to not only survive, 
but thrive off the heels of their 
penalty kill.

“We 
were 
aggressive,” 

said freshman forward Dylan 
Larkin. “Didn’t give them much 
time to set up. Travis Lynch had 
a breakaway, and there were 
some chances, and we took away 
their time and space, which was 
good.”

The penalty kill was on fire 

Thursday, but that hasn’t always 
been the case for the Wolverines. 
Even with the effort against 
Wisconsin, Michigan is just 33rd 
out of 59 teams in the penalty 
kill, and — even with the nation’s 
top-ranked offense — has shown 
a tendency to kill momentum 
with sloppy play throughout the 
unit.

“I thought our guys were 

dialed in tonight and did a 
good job,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “In fairness, 
Wisconsin hasn’t had a lot of 
momentum on their power play. 
But we still had to kill it because 
they had good puck control and 
they had some good looks. So 
that’s an important part of the 
game.”

But the opposite was the case 

in Thursday’s win. Whether it 
was killing the 5-on-3 in the 
third period to close out the 
victory, rebounding from kills 
with consecutive goals in the 
opening minutes of the second 
period, or even using an early 
power-play 
opportunity 
for 

Wisconsin as a catalyst to wake 
up the sluggish offense in the 
opening minute of the game, 
it seemed that every time the 
Wolverines had their backs 
against the wall, they turned it 
into a momentum shift.

“It’s huge, it’s a confidence 

builder,” Berenson said of the 
success. “It starts with your 
goalie, 
then 
your 
forward’s 

willingness to get in the shooting 
lane or sticks in the passing lanes, 
blocking shots, winning faceoffs, 
getting the puck out when you 
get it.

“There’s a lot more to penalty 

killing than just penalty killing. 
There’s a lot of little things that 
have to happen.”

Big Ten preview: It’s Michigan and

Minnesota, then everybody else

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

In the conference room at the new Donald R. Shepherd Softball 

Center, pictures of past Michigan Big Ten championship teams are 
proudly displayed on the wall. There’s just one problem: there’s no 
room for more pictures.

This fact is proof of how dominant the No. 4 Michigan softball 

program is as it’s vying for its eighth consecutive conference 
championship.

With arguably the best player and coach in the country in junior 

infielder Sierra Romero and coach Carol Hutchins, the Wolverines are 
favorites to win the conference, looking to add another picture to the 
collection, and in turn, moving the frames to a different, larger wall. 
But to achieve the milestone, Michigan will have to navigate past the 
following teams.

No. 15 Minnesota (24-4)

If any team in the Big Ten has a better offense than Michigan, it’s 

the Golden Gophers. They may be the only team capable of challenging 
Michigan for a conference championship.

Minnesota leads the Big Ten in batting average (.351), hits (270) and 

doubles (52). Despite a loss to No. 20 UCF, the Golden Gophers have 
beaten No. 12 Cal, No. 21 Arizona State and No. 24 Mississippi State. 
Their one-two punch of senior utility players Kaitlyn Richardson 
(.437 batting average, 31 runs batted in) and Hannah Granger (.474 
batting average, 30 runs batted in) are both in the top five in those 
categories.

Player to Watch: Sophomore right-handed pitcher Sara Groenewegen
Headlining the pitching staff that leads the Big Ten in strikeouts 

is Groenewegen with 167 Ks. She has pitched 109 innings this season, 
the most in the Big Ten, taking a majority of the pitching duties for 
the Golden Gophers. Her 0.96 earned-run average, .152 opposing 
batting average and 15 wins are all best in the Big Ten. She also 
has offensive prowess, batting .338 and racking up 11 total bases 
in one game twice this season.

Purdue (19-9)

The Boilermakers haven’t played a very competitive schedule 

so far, just playing two ranked opponents, including a win against 
No. 23 Texas A&M. Purdue leads the Big Ten in triples (nine) 
and is second in Big Ten for lowest team ERA (1.78). Freshman 
outfielder Maya Hughes may be the future of the program, 
batting .315 and stealing 16 bases.

Player to watch: Senior infielder Ashley Burkhardt
Burkhardt is a triple-threat type of player, batting .438 while 

hitting eight home runs and batting in 32 runs. She leads the 
conference in hits (39) and is second in the Big Ten with 70 total 
bases. Her speed keeps teams guessing, as she has the ability to 
swipe four bases in one game — a feat accomplished in a March 15 
contest against Western Michigan.

Maryland (17-11)

The Terrapins have lost all of their games to currently ranked 

teams, but their expertise is in plate vision. They rank second in 
the Big Ten in walks (109), and have walked 13 times in one game. 
Senior outfielder Erin Pronobis has a .387 average with 45 total 
bases.

Player to watch: Senior right-handed pitcher Kaitlyn Schmeiser
Schmeiser is among the top Big Ten pitchers, being the third-best 

pitcher in regard to wins (12), innings pitched (109) and strikeouts 
(104).

Ohio State (13-9)

The Buckeyes have lost to every ranked opponent they have faced 

this season: No. 11 UCLA, No. 9 Auburn and No. 18 Washington 
(twice). Freshman outfielder Taylor White earned Big Ten Freshman 
of the Week honors after hitting .583 with a home run and a triple at 
the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic.

Player to watch: Senior outfielder Caitlin Conrad
Conrad is the lead-off hitter for Ohio State, batting .358 with 25 

RBI and a .642 slugging percentage.

Michigan State (15-12)

While the Spartans have struck out the fourth most in the Big Ten 

(139) and teams have stolen 45 bases on the Michigan State defense in 
49 chances, they have shown signs of promise. They lost to No. 20 UCF 
by run-rule, but have beaten once-ranked Tulsa. Redshirt freshman 
right-hander Kristina Zalewski has a 1.63 ERA and 91 strikeouts to 
lead the pitching staff.

Player to Watch: Senior outfielder Alyssa McBride
Despite batting in the nine spot for a majority of the season, 

McBride — who batted .184 last season — is the leader of the Michigan 
State offense, batting .443 with a .538 on base percentage.

Rutgers (10-7)

The Scarlet Knights have shown both excellence and failure at 

the plate. In one game, they hit six doubles, but in another, they left 
15 on base. The pitching staff has a collective 4.76 ERA, and must 
pitch more efficiently if Rutgers wants to remain competitive in the 
Big Ten.

Player to watch: Senior outfielder Jackie Bates

Bates has a .439 batting average and is second in the Big Ten with a 

.930 slugging percentage.

Northwestern (11-10)

The Wildcats have allowed the least amount of hits in the Big Ten 

(120), but that’s only because they haven’t played that many games. 
Junior right-handed pitcher Kristen Wood leads the pitching staff 
with 84 strikeouts and has held opponents to a .224 batting average. 
Northwestern has also struck out 14 times in one game, proving that 
its offense is not to be revered.

Player to watch: Senior outfielder Andrea DiPrima
DiPrima’s statistics may fall once Northwestern gets deeper into 

the season, but she is currently third in the Big Ten with a .466 batting 
average and second in the conference with a .597 on-base percentage.

Wisconsin (13-13)

The Badgers will put pressure on opposing teams on the base paths. 

They have stolen 86 bases in 101 chances, leading every other team in 
the Big Ten by at least 28 stolen bases. They have had one-run losses 
against formidable teams like No. 25 UAB (twice).

Player to watch: Senior outfielder Maria Van Abel
Van Abel is the catalyst of the Wisconsin offense, leading the Big 

Ten in stolen bases (21) while batting .407 with 35 hits.

Nebraska (12-12)

The Cornhuskers score in bunches (averaging close to nine runs a 

game) and are second in the Big Ten in batting average (.348). Eight 
players have started at least 15 games and have a batting average 
over .300. But they have lost to all of their ranked opponents, and the 
pitching is to blame. Hitters have punished the pitching staff to the 
tune of a .317 average and a 5.47 ERA.

Player to Watch: Junior outfielder Kiki Stokes
Stokes is batting .444, slugging .806 and has an on base percentage 

of .549.

arol Hutchins has been Michigan’s softball coach for decades. 
Everybody knows that. She has won 17 Big Ten regular-season 
conference championships, 16 NCAA regional championships 

and a national championship in 2005. She’s in the NFCA Hall of Fame, 
too.

Michigan softball’s inaugural season was in 

1978. By 1985, Hutchins was the head coach, 
and has been the general to lead the Wolverines 
into battle ever since. Entering the 2015 season, 
Hutchins has amassed a career 1,349-452 record 
and a .746 win percentage.

With Hutchins at the helm, there will always be 

talk of league championships, of winning streaks 
that stretch into the 20s and of making a run in the 
postseason NCAA Women’s College World Series.

With her résumé and the program’s continued 

success, it’s obvious that the Wolverines should 
have no trouble putting together a respectable season. Undoubtedly, 
Michigan will add to Hutchins’ win total. But really, the number of 
wins won’t matter. For Team 38, the last win of the season will be the 
one that carries the most significance.

Hutchins is the grand master behind the chessboard, and has all 

the pieces in place to make a championship run. But ultimately, it’s the 
players, not the coach, who execute the plan of attack.

Michigan, even with a legendary coach and a lineup full of stars, lost 

to the No. 1 Florida Gators to open the season. It served as a reminder 
for the Wolverines that despite their perennial status as a member of 
softball’s elite, beating champions, or even becoming them, is never 
an easy task.

This Michigan team has already taken some lumps. Against Florida, 

it was senior left-hander and 2014 second-team All-American Haylie 
Wagner who threw a wild pitch to let a Gator baserunner score from 
third and clinch the game.

But it was only one bad pitch, and only one game, the first in a long 

season.

By Spring Break, Michigan had built a 19-game win streak, and 

had hit 20 home runs through five games at the Arizona State Slugger 
Invitational, but fell in back-to-back games to then-No. 22 Arizona 
State, and again to Florida.

Against Florida, Michigan had chances to even up its head-to-head 

record, jumping out to a 2-0 lead in the first and holding on until the 
sixth when Florida scored three runs to earn its first lead. Michigan 
was unable to conjure up any offense and did nothing against the 
Gators in the seventh, losing 3-2.

It’s worth noting that the Spring Break losses to Florida and Arizona 

State came at the end of a long road trip for Michigan, at which point 
the Wolverines had flown to every game they had played. But when 
the Wolverines finally got back to Ann Arbor, after some much-needed 

rest, the first home game ended in disappointment, too.

Kent State, the Wolverines’ only unranked loss, squeaked away 

with a win behind junior right-hander Emma Johnson and her .96 
earned-run average to upset Michigan, 3-0.

Statistically, the Wolverines are already among the best in the 

Big Ten in multiple categories, but again, the Wolverines’ ability to 
compete at an elite level isn’t what is in question. At times, Michigan 
has looked deserving of its ranking, and before the losses to Arizona 
State and Florida in early March, it was primed to move up in the 
rankings even further. Unfortunately for the Wolverines, timing is 
everything.

No one calls into question the ability or character of anyone on the 

Michigan coaching staff, and no one should. But in the few times when 

Michigan has been faced with truly top-tier competition, mainly 
against Kent State’s Johnson and Florida, it has stumbled.

It’s an old cliché in sports that a good team has to beat the teams 

it’s supposed to beat, and there’s zero doubt Michigan will continue 
to do that. What will define this team are the games Michigan isn’t 
“supposed” to win, when they’ll be evenly matched.

Michigan is very good, there’s no doubt about that. But how the 

Wolverines grow from the early-season losses, and more importantly, 
how they respond in future high-pressure situations, will ultimately 
determine the outcome of this season. Should they capitalize, they 
will have the possibility to be great once again under Hutchins’ watch.

How a position becomes an identity

Michigan’s 
position-by-
position preview

Daily Sports Writer

With the Big Ten season right around the corner, the ros-

ter for the No. 4 Michigan softball team is finally settling into 
place. Michigan coach Carol Hutchins continues to shuffle 
players in and out, especially in the infield, but a handful of 
Wolverines have consistently made the starting lineup.

Defensively, the team is well rounded and has immense 

depth, so starting spots are largely earned on the field by 
standing out with the bat.

The Daily examines the 2015 softball team position by posi-

tion.

Pitchers

Michigan’s pitching staff is robust. With all three pitchers 

returning from last season, experience has not been an issue. 
Senior left-hander Haylie Wagner currently has a 1.98 earned-
run average, and was named to the preseason Player of the 
Year Top 50 Watch List. Wagner is known to be a contact 
pitcher, jamming up right-handed hitters.

Sophomore right-hander Megan Betsa has been lights out 

lately, and Hutchins refers to her as a “strike out pitcher” that 
you want to have in the circle late in games. Against then-No. 
3 Alabama, Betsa allowed just two runs while striking out six 
in a complete game. Her confidence, which was lacking last 
season, seems to be off the charts so far.

Finally, senior right-hander Sara Driesenga is a drop-ball 

pitcher, getting a lot of ground balls from her opponents. She 
is currently dealing with a nagging injury and has appeared in 
just seven games. Nonetheless, Driesenga holds a 0.78 ERA, 
the lowest on the staff.

Freshman Tera Blanco also makes occasional appearances 

in the circle, and Hutchins hopes to work her into the rotation 
more as the season matures.

Catcher

Senior Lauren Sweet is the go-to catcher, but she was 

injured in a game against Kent State, and the length of her 
recovery is still unknown. Freshman Aidan Falk has since 
taken over. While Falk seems capable of filling her duties as 
catcher, she will have to make up immense ground offensively.

This preseason, Sweet put up a .329 batting average, 

recorded 27 runs batted in and hit six home runs. Though her 
bat might not be as strong as Sweet’s, Falk has been impres-
sive, hitting three home runs so far this season.

First Base

Since joining the roster, Blanco has stepped in as the Wol-

verines’ first baseman. Blanco started all but one of Michigan’s 
games, earning her starting role right away. Blanco boasts a 
.423 slugging percentage and has 25 RBI. Freshman Taylor 
Swearingen also appears in the lineup often at first base.

Second Base

Both junior Sierra Romero and sophomore Abby Ramirez 

are seeing a lot of time at second. Now, Romero seems to have 
settled in. One of the best players around college softball, 
Romero carries a .531 batting average, by far the highest per-
centage in the starting lineup. Her 1.109 slugging percentage 
is the fourth highest in the nation, and the second highest 
among power conferences. Her biggest threat is with her 
bat, but nonetheless, Romero is a solid defensive choice 
for second base.

Shortstop

Romero has been swapping in and out of shortstop with 

Ramirez. As Romero plays more at second, it’s becoming clear 
that Ramirez seems to be earning the starting spot at short-
stop. Consistent with her bat as well, Ramirez holds a .303 bat-
ting average and has started all 29 game.

Third Base

Sophomore Lindsay Montemarano and Swearingen have 

both seen plenty of innings at third. 

Montemarano has started 22 games, all at 

third. She struggled to hit throughout the non-

conference schedule, posting a .196 batting average 

as well as going hitless through nine games. Swearingen has 
seen more time at third lately, but if Montemarano gets back 
on track with her bat, it will be tougher for the freshman to 
crack the starting lineup.

Outfield

If there are any positions that are actually set, it’s the out-

field. Sophomore Kelly Christner will be in leftfield, junior 
Sierra Lawrence in center and junior Kelsey Susalla in right. 
The trio is part of Michigan’s core power hitters, and all three 
of them are in the top four of the batting order.

While Susalla is new to the outfield this season, she has 

adjusted well. Christner, who rarely started during her fresh-
man campaign, has played in every game so far. Finally, Law-
rence, who has a perfect fielding percentage, has become one 
of Michigan’s most consistent and reliable outfielders, tallying 
just four errors in her 151 career appearances.

Ice breakers were always hard for Kelsey Susalla. The junior 

Michigan softball player could never find the right words for 
an answer.

“Those are the (questions) I always struggle with,” Susalla 

said. “In class, they’re like ‘tell us something interesting about 
yourself’ and I’m like, ‘I don’t know.’ ”

The question applied to the softball field as well. She didn’t 

know her identity there, either.

* * *

A few weeks after Florida State eliminated the Wolverines 

from the 2014 NCAA Super Regional with a heartbreaking 
walk-off homerun, Susalla stepped into coach Carol Hutchins’ 
office.

It was her turn to have the end-of-the-season meeting that 

Hutchins conducts with every player on her roster.

Susalla’s first message was to be expected — she wanted to 

get more playing time, and she would do whatever it took to 
earn it.

The second message, however, was not so predictable.
“She came to me and said, ‘I’d like to try the outfield.’ ” 

Hutchins said.

* * *

Susalla had not played a single inning of her softball career 

in the outfield. Until high school, she consistently played sec-
ond base, and at Garden City High School, she was converted 
into a first and third baseman.

Garden City coach Barry Patterson even played Susalla at 

pitcher for her junior and senior year, and she garnered All-
State honors at the position.

For her current success, Patterson credited Susalla’s experi-

ence in the circle for her attitude on the field.

“(She gained) an understanding of what it means to be that 

person,” Patterson said. “Every single play and every eye in the 
park starts with you. You’re such a big factor. I think part of the 
demeanor that she has of never getting rattled (comes from her 
experience pitching). You can’t pitch from an emotional stand-
point. You just have to fight through adversity.”

Susalla also set career records for runs scored, batting aver-

age, hits, home runs, doubles and triples in her tenure at Gar-
den City, but in her first two years at Michigan, she struggled 

to consistently etch her name into the lineup.

She played just 36 and 34 games in 2013 and 2014, respec-

tively — about half of the total contests the Wolverines played 
those seasons. Over the course of those 70 games, Susalla start-
ed in just 20.

So as Susalla entered that office, she knew an opportunity 

was there for her taking, and she wasn’t about to let it slip 
through her fingers

“I thought since we were losing a couple outfielders with 

that graduating class, that opens a spot up for me,” Susalla said. 
“I just asked if I could work on it over the summer. I would 
take extra fly balls, get some outfield work in with my throws, 
anything like that.”

* * *

The outfielders who had graduated left Susalla with large 

shoes to fill.

Among the graduating class were Lyndsay Doyle, Nicole 

Sappingfield and Katie Luetkens. Both Sappingfield and Doyle 
played every game in the outfield for the Wolverines in 2014.

Michigan’s leadoff hitter, Doyle, posted a .369 batting aver-

age, while Sappingfield boasted a .402 and .431 batting average 
and on-base percentage, respectively.

Though Luetkens played just nine games in 2014, she was 

a team captain with Sappingfield and had spent her whole 
career in the outfield.

Luetkens mentored Susalla, spending time with her last 

summer. The bulk of the time was spent on the field, as the 
veteran hit fly balls to Susalla and fine-tuned her fielding tech-
nique.

“(The most difficult part) was reading the ball off the bat,” 

Susalla said. “When you’re in the infield, you’re a lot closer to 
the batter. You can see if it’s going to be a line drive, ground ball 
or pop up. But in the outfield, a good 50 to 60 feet further back, 
along with the wind and sun, judging the ball (was tough).”

Susalla had the opportunity to apply her newly developed 

talent in game situations prior to the 2015 campaign. Per her 
request, she was occasionally deployed to the outfield with her 
travel team, the Kalamazoo Hooters, over the summer.

Susalla’s efforts haven’t gone unnoticed by her teammates.
“She’s honestly one of the most hard-working people I’ve 

ever met,” said sophomore pitcher Megan Betsa. “I saw it this 
summer. I stayed (in the offseason) and she was here also. She 
was (on the field) and Olivia Richvalsky’s dad came. He would 
just hit her fly balls, and she was out there working hard every 
day because that’s what she wanted to do. She wanted to play.

“She earned her spot, and she’s keeping it up. She still comes 

in every day.”

* * *

With her position finally solidified, Susalla has been thriv-

ing.

She has started 28 of 29 games this year, and her stat line has 

been exceptional.

Susalla has already eclipsed her season totals in all major 

batting categories from her freshman and sophomore season. 
In 77 at-bats, she has recorded six home runs and 30 RBI, while 
posting a staggering .792 slugging percentage. On top of that, 
Susalla boasts a .390 batting average with nine doubles.

Most notably, the junior seems to be at home in right field. 

Susalla has not recorded an error this season and has shown 
flashes of brilliance — she robbed Alabama of a momentum-
shifting home run at the Easton Bama Bash by making a spec-
tacular play at the wall.

* * *

But Susalla’s position and performance aren’t the only 

things that have dramatically changed this season. As her 
teammates explained, their first impression of Susalla was that 
she was quiet and shy. But Susalla is quickly emerging as a lead-
er for the Wolverines. She arrives early to practice every day 
for batting practice, and sets an example for her teammates, 
who are feeding off of her energy.

“She’s like that blue-collar kid that comes in with her lunch 

bucket,” Hutchins said. “(She) just is trying to do her part. She 
doesn’t have these huge expectations, she’s just working hard. 
She’s had to work really hard to get this opportunity, and she’s 
taking advantage of it.”

Added junior infielder Sierra Romero: “Her confidence, it 

has improved like crazy. From her freshman and sophomore 
year to her junior year, she’s just continued to get better and 
continued to become more of a dominant power hitter.”

* * *

Susalla was a first baseman. She was a second baseman. She 

was a third baseman. She was even a pitcher.

But now, Susalla finally knows who she is. She’s found her 

identity.

She’s the starting right fielder for the No. 4 team in the 

nation.
