What happens next: ‘U’

University 

admissions officers 
discuss application 

review process 

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily News Editor

Through the Family Education 

Rights and Privacy Act, students 
can view their applications to 
schools where they were accepted 
and attend, as publicized by Stan-
ford University newsletter The 
Fountain Hopper in January.

Earlier this year, with the 

hopes of gaining insight into the 
admissions process, the Daily 
worked with nine students who 
viewed their applications to the 
University, along with evaluative 
comments made by the Office of 
Undergraduate Admissions. 

The nine students represented 

a variety of genders, class stand-
ings, races, ethnicities, sexual 
orientations, 
socioeconomic 

statuses, 
in- 
and 
out-of-state 

residencies, 
nationalities 
and 

geographic areas. The Univer-
sity did not allow the students to 
make copies or photographs of the 
applications, but did permit them 
to take handwritten notes, which 
they provided to the Daily for the 
purpose of this article.

This article was written with 

the purpose of providing more 
first-person 
information 
about 

a typically closed process often 
surrounded by assumption and 
myth, with the understanding 
that among an application pool 
of tens of thousands, testimonials 
from individual applications will 
not necessarily be definitive of the 
overall process.

The process
Cumulatively, over the three 

years covered in student appli-
cations reviewed by the Daily 
— 2012, 2013 and 2014 — nearly 
140,000 
prospective 
students 

applied to the University. 

What the admissions office’s 

final decisions stemmed from, 
according to the applications we 

reviewed, were largely an average 
of two- or three-page-long evalu-
ations and a rating between 1 and 
15 — 1 being the highest rating an 
application can receive, 15 being 
the lowest. 

Among the nine students’ appli-

cations, there were several dif-
ferent paths taken through the 
admissions office before being 
admitted to the University.

Some were only evaluated by 

an admissions staff member and 
a senior admissions staff member, 
for a total of two evaluations. Oth-
ers, however, had an additional 
evaluation from an admissions 
territory counselor. 

In an interview with the Daily, 

Erica Sanders, interim director 
of the Office of Admissions, and 
Melissa Purdy, assistant direc-
tor of the Office of Admissions, 
said applications receive differ-
ing numbers of evaluations based 
on the first evaluator — one of 82 
part-time staff members who are 
assigned files at random.

Summer Daily News Editor

University donor and alum 

Bertram Askwith passed away 
at the age of 104 Monday night, 
according to a University press 
release.

During his years as an under-

graduate, Askwith served as an 
editor for The Michigan Daily. 
He majored in economics with a 
minor in journalism, and gradu-
ated from the University in 1931.

Askwith began his business, 

Campus Coach Lines — a com-
pany that transported students 
who were New York natives 
home for holidays and school 
breaks — as an undergraduate 
student. He started the business 
after a railroad strike in 1928 left 
many students struggling to find 
ways home from campus. 

From 2000 to 2008, Askwith 

served as the vice chair of the 
Michigan Difference campaign. 
He also created the Askwith 
Fund for Innovation in Asthma 
and Allergy Management in the 
Center for Managing Chronic 
Disease within the School of 
Public Health, which focuses 
on creating new techniques to 
aid those affected by asthma 
or allergies. Askwith, himself, 
donated to the fund. 

Askwith

SUMME R SACUA 
Shakespeare in the 
Arb performance 
draws crowds 

Director adds 
modern touches 
to Shakespeare’s 
traditional works

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Last Thursday, Friday, Sat-

urday and Sunday, a set of 
actors made up of Univer-
sity faculty and students per-
formed in Nichols Arboretum 
during 
the 
annual 
Shake-

speare in the Arb.

The 
program’s 
director, 

Kate Mendeloff, a Residen-
tial College faculty member, 
spearheaded the tradition in 
2001 by first directing an out-
door production of “A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream” as 
part of a grant.

“I 
chose 
‘Midsummer 

Night’s 
Dream’ 
because 
I 

thought it was so perfect for 
the arboretum. And it was a 
real hit, despite the weather. 
I mean, by our third per-
formance, over 400 people 
showed up,” Mendeloff said.

The success of the first 

production led to a revival 
the following summer, which 
Mendeloff 
said 
received 

record crowds.

To commemorate the play 

that 
launched 
the 
annual 

performances, 
“A 
Midsum-

mer Night’s Dream” is per-
formed once every five years. 
Shakespeare in the Arb tra-
ditionally hosts comedies or 
romances such as “Twelfth 
Night”, “Much Ado About 
Nothing” and “Love’s Labour’s 
Lost.”

According 
to 
Mendeloff, 

Shakespeare’s comedic plays 
are more suitable to the fam-
ily-oriented crowds that are 
usually drawn to the produc-
tions. Furthermore, she said, 

they allow for more cross-
sectional casting options — a 
benefit for Mendeloff’s more 
experimental renditions.

“I want to be able to offer a 

lot of roles to women and find 
plays where I can do cross-
casting easily. (My goal is) to 
provide as many opportunities 
because there generally are 
more student actresses and 
they don’t get as many oppor-
tunities 
to 
perform,” 
said 

Mendeloff.

Mendeloff, as an all-inclu-

sive director, was unconven-
tional with casting choices. 
In her production of “A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream,” three 
performers played the role of 
Puck, the play’s mischievous 
elf. As they performed the 
role simultaneously, the actors 
divided up the lines onstage.

“I started that because the 

first time I did this I had three 
people who wanted to be Puck 
and I said, ‘Figure it out,’ ” 
Mendeloff said. “I liked the 
idea of multiple Pucks so much 
that I’ve had that every time. 
I can’t imagine one actor play-
ing Puck.”

Other originalities in Men-

deloff’s productions besides 
the increase of characters 
onstage includes strong femi-
nist tones.

Elizabeth Wagner played 

the Queen of the Amazons 
in 
“A 
Midsummer 
Night’s 

Dream.”

“The play starts off with a 

physical fight between Hip-
polyta and Theseus,” she said. 
“This is probably the most 
stage combat I’ve done in a 
production.”

Mendeloff said the venue 

lent itself to this creativity in 
production because it is more 
versatile for comedic perfor-
mances.

“The environment is really a 

player in every scene. If we’re

Talent circus showcases artists, performers 

Showcase features 

performances 

from library staff, 
student employees 

By ALAINA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

A drum team, a storyteller and 

a spinning artist, among other 
performers, wowed onlookers at 
the Duderstadt Center as part of 
the second annual Library Tal-
ent Circus Wednesday.

The 
circus, 
according 
to 

Rachel Maddix, who is the chair 

of the staff forum board, intend-
ed to bring together the Univer-
sity’s librarians and library staff. 
In addition to live performers 
and three live demonstrations, 
the event also featured works 
from several University gallery 
artists.

Both 
the 
librarians 
and 

staff forum boards collaborat-
ed to host the event. Jacques 
Mersereau, the chairman of the 
Librarians’ Forum boards, said 
he conceptualized the talent 
showcase after noticing talents 
within some of the committee 
members.

“...We 
thought, 
‘There’s 

so much talent around us’,” 

Mersereau said. “Most people 
have no idea — they see some-
body behind the desk every day 
and they don’t really know what 
else they do in their life, and 
what I found out was there’s a 
lot of artists who have found a 
home here, their day gig is the 
library.”

Kelly Goodknecht, who was 

one of the featured acts, per-
formed 
a 
spinning 
routine. 

Goodknecht said she learned to 
spin when she was younger. Her 
reason for spinning, she said, is 
that it is relaxing.

“It’s a great way to kind 

of 
decompress,” 
Goodknecht 

said. “A lot of it’s the repeti-

tive aspect, it’s kind of just this 
repetitive hand motion, eventu-
ally, your hands just kind of go 
and do their thing.”

The Wolverine Press, which 

releases prints for the Helen 
Zell Visiting Writers Series 
and is part of the Buhr Library, 
was also among the demonstra-
tions at the event. After print-
ing and giving out a black and 
white picture of a wolverine to 
a person passing by, Wolverine 
Press Director Fritz Swanson 
said most people working at the 
press are Helen Zell MFA writ-
ing students.

Kat Finch, one of those Zell 

fellows with the press, said the 

students design the broadsides 
for the visiting writers.

“They’re called devils — par-

tially from the wolverine, par-
tially because back when people 
did letterpress, the little people 
running around, like the young 
children, were called devils 
because they would pick up the 
extras and such and throw them 
in the fire to bring everything 
else down,” Finch said.

Maddix said they held the 

showcase at the Duderstadt to 
coax students to travel to North 
Campus.

“We host it at the Duderstadt 

Center because, that way, it gets

office website, the staff members 

are “former educators and admis-
sions professionals.” 

LinkedIn searches of employees 

who reviewed applications pro-
vided to the Daily showed back-
grounds including a substitute 
teacher and tour guide staff coor-
dinator. 

A particularly high or low rating 

at this stage, Sanders said, causes 
an application to be expedited, 
meaning it goes directly to a senior 
admissions staff member who 
assigns the applicant’s second and 
final rating. 

Among applications reviewed, 

scores of 1, 2 and 3 were all expe-
dited.

Applications that are not expe-

dited instead go to the applicant’s 
territory counselor — a member of 
the admissions office who serves 
as the liaison for a particular geo-
graphic area — for a second evalu-
ation, and then typically move to a 
senior staff member for a third and 
final evaluation. 

“The territory counselor is able 

to add that added nuance to the 
review process that the first evalu-
ator isn’t necessarily going to be 
able to do with a lack of familiar-
ity of that particular high school,” 
Purdy said. 

Regardless of which path the 

Daily-reviewed applications took 
through the system, their evalu-
ations were largely similar in 
format — a standardized form 
accompanied by an overall rating. 
Four main types of information 
were highlighted by the standard-
ized form: personal or extenuat-

ing circumstances, high school 
academic performance and overall 
educational environment, counsel-
or and teacher recommendations, 
and any other evaluative measures 
or considerations. 

Additionally, evaluators filled 

out an overall comments section, 
which was typically where the 
rationale for the rating and a more 
subjective evaluation of notes in 
the rest of the form was found.

Among applications the Daily 

reviewed, academic record stood 
out as a key focus. 

Both in the section for academic 

performance and in overall com-
ments, each evaluator noted the 
applicant’s GPA, standardized test 
scores and the number of core, 
honors, Advanced Placement and 
International Baccalaureate class-
es taken compared to the number 
available at the applicant’s high 
school. 

Also noted were average stan-

dardized test scores and the four-
year-college-going 
rate 
at 
the 

applicant’s high school, drawn 
either 
from 
information 
pro-

vided by the high schools or from 
Descriptor PLUS, a College Board 
data set purchased by the Univer-
sity. 

According to Sanders, when it 

comes to academic performance, 
evaluators not only look at the raw 
numbers, but also at what an aver-
age student looks like in the appli-
cant’s high school and geographic 
area. 

“So, that (as) we’re evaluating 

the application, we’re able to deter-
mine — is this a student who took 
advantage of curriculum opportu-
nities that were available, or were 
there no opportunities available to 
the student?” she said. 

For many of the applications 

reviewed, in written comments, 
evaluators paid special attention 
to coursework, noting varying 
facts about levels of rigor and more 
unique opportunities. 

Part of the overall comments 

for one applicant read, “Is taking a 
rigorous schedule. Has challenged 
by dual-enrolling, taking summer 
workshops.” A second evaluator 
wrote that the same applicant had 
taken four AP classes, and added, 
“which is not out of ordinary at 
school.”

For another application, an 

evaluator noted the “challenged 
rigor available at (applicant’s high 
school).” A second noted the appli-
cant had taken six AP classes, 
characterizing that as “strong 
curr(iculum) for school.” Other 
applications 
specifically 
noted 

student interest in University aca-
demic units, such as the Residen-
tial College, or professional career 
tracks, such as premedical. 

Grades also were subjects of 

additional 
comments 
in 
some 

cases. Several application evalua-
tions referenced an upward grade 
trend, and several others noted 
class grades below a B. 

In one application, the high 

school in and of itself garnered 
attention, and was identified as 
“high priority underrepresented” 
due to the school’s “cluster.” Sand-
ers said the term referred to a clas-
sification system provided as part 
of Descriptor PLUS.

Descriptor PLUS groups high 

schools in “clusters” through simi-
larities of factors including average 
AP and standardized test scores, 
percentage 
of 
first-generation 

students, median family income, 
racial demographics and percent-
age of adults with professional 
jobs, according to College Board.

Beyond academic record, mul-

tiple other demographic char-
acteristics 
and 
extracurricular 

experiences were also highlighted. 
 

Online 
admissions 
materials 

note that the University has a holis-

tic process that takes into account 
“participation in extracurricular 
activities, professional arts train-
ing, and evidence of leadership, 
awards, and service” as well as 
“educational and cultural diver-
sity.”

Almost all of those categories, 

such as leadership in extracurricu-
lars, artistic talent, academic and 
professional honors, cultural iden-
tity, and aspects of essays, were 
noted in at least one of the applica-
tions.

For 
extracurriculars, 
many 

evaluators noted, in particular, 
the number of years the student 
had been involved. Some also com-
mented specifically on the diver-
sity of the students’ activities as 
a positive, characterizing the stu-
dents as well-rounded. One resume 
that received such a comment, for 
example, included journalism, reli-
gious activities and student gov-
ernment. 

Several applications reviewed 

also referenced alumni family 
connections, income and parents’ 
educational levels, which aren’t 
factors listed in the main online 
materials as under consideration. 
On one application, low income 
and parent-education level were 
specifically noted as extenuating 
factors. Several applications men-
tioned alumni connections both 
in the overall comments and as an 
extenuating factor. 

Those three, as well as a number 

of other factors such as military 
service and being a scholarship 
athlete, are referenced in anappen-
dix to the online materials, but not 
on the main site where factors like

OPINION

I 

feel as though I’m breaking one 
of the unwritten, cardinal rules 
of writing by beginning this 

column 
by 
stat-

ing that for the 
past few days I’ve 
had absolutely no 
clue what to write 
about. This week, I 
was afflicted with 
a serious bout of 
writer’s block. In 
past writings, I’ve 
tried to focus on 
topics or news sto-
ries relevant to my 
experiences or to the experiences 
of those around me. I tossed around 
numerous ideas, but every moment 
I began to draft an outline, every 
thought I scrawled felt like a reitera-
tion of a previous piece of writing. I 
stubbornly wanted to stay within the 
realm of the subject areas I’ve written 
— and feel somewhat knowledgeable 
— about before. Establishing a niche 
as a writer is crucial, but at the same 
time, you do run the risk of sound-
ing redundant if you don’t creatively 
expand. During a conversation with 
a friend, I, in one of the most cliché 
ways imaginable — another symptom 
of my current affliction — expressed 
concerns that I was beginning to 
“beat a dead horse” as I tried to for-
mulate a new idea from the niche I 
spent so much time trying to craft.

In order to diversify and broaden 

the scope of my writing, I delved into 
a subject I frequently talk about, but 
rarely have the chance to write about 
— the music industry. As a music 
devotee, I often scour the Internet 
searching for album releases, artist 
bios, new singles, interesting Spo-
tify playlists and music video unveil-
ings. I — embracing a scenario that’s 
unfortunately quite common in our 
society — possess deep appreciation 

for the artistic products created by 
a highly problematic industry. Even 
after attending the concert of one of 
my favorite artists last week, the late 
night trip back to Ann Arbor rapidly 
transformed from excited recollec-
tions of the performance into discus-
sions about the varying degrees of 
creative control artists maintain over 
their work and the extent to which 
the industry relies upon sexist ideas 
to market and promote artists and 
their music.

Sexism in the industry was exact-

ly what I found this weekend as the 
media was enthralled by the “feminist 
manifesto” provided in a female musi-
cian’s tweet this past weekend. Aim-
ing to demolish media speculation that 
sought to objectify her as merely the 
“possession/property” of her past — or 
any suspected new — significant other, 
Ariana Grande, at length, utilized fem-
inist principles to point out the exten-
sive double standards in today’s music 
industry. Her musings were a passion-
ate attempt to redirect the conversa-
tion and cut the metaphorical rope the 
media was using to tie her worth to her 
romantic relationships.

A Washington Post writer com-

menting upon the media attention 
Grande’s “feminist rampage” gar-
nered lauded the tweet as a “brilliant 
career move” stating that: “But when 
stars come equipped with a list of sub-
jects they will not talk about, they risk 
alienating themselves (and becoming 
quite boring). The best thing a celebri-
ty can do is endear themselves to fans 
to get personal. And if they come off as 
robots without a personality or origi-
nal thought, that’s a very quick way to 
slide into irrelevance.”

Regardless of whether or not the 

tweet was a burst of genuine femi-
nist frustration or a moment of media 
hype to help avoid the oblivion of cul-
tural irrelevance, the social media 

The economic incentives 

of the legislation do not out-
weigh the concerns regard-
ing the high concentration 
of high-risk inmates and the 
problematic history of the pri-
vate company assuming con-
trol of the reopened Baldwin 
facility. The group in question, 
GEO Group, had issues at the 
same facility, which led to its 
closure in 2005. A state audit 
revealed that with no savings 
to the state, the GEO Group 
was also creating a security 
issue because its low wages led 
to high staff turnover. Previ-
ously, the company has been 
penalized in other states, such 
as New Mexico, where it was 
forced to pay $1.1 million in 
fines for understaffing one of 
the correctional facilities it 
operates. Additionally, at one 
of its facilities in Mississippi, 

GEO Group was highly scru-
tinized for numerous unfair 
conditions and human rights 
violations, such as the pro-
motion of fights, sexual con-
duct between employees and 
inmates and beating prisoners.

Outsourcing criminal jus-

tice initiatives to for-profit 
companies is a strategy that 
hasn’t worked well in Michi-
gan in the past. It has created 
human rights violations that 
are a stain on the Michigan 
Department of Corrections, 
and there’s no indication of 
any significant change. Out-
sourcing prison food services 
to Aramark (a publicly traded 
company valued at more than 
$6 billion) has been a recurring 
problem. Since Aramark began 
its contract in Michigan in 
December 2013, more than 100 
employees have been fired for 

alleged misconduct, including 
distributing drugs, having sex-
ual conduct with inmates and 
even an attempt to murder-
for-hire. Food shortages and 
troubles with serving unsani-
tary food last summer caused 
Snyder to levy a $200,000 fine 
against Aramark, but the prob-
lems persist. This June, more 
maggots were discovered in 
Aramark kitchens. Aramark 
has demonstrated in Michi-
gan 
the 
consequences 
of 

privatizing prisons: for-profit 
prison companies have incen-
tive to cut corners to increase 
profit, often at the expense of 
the prisoners. Additionally, 
for-profit prison companies 
have very little oversight, 
which is a major issue in an 
environment where so many 
human rights violations are 
already flagrant.

A redundant narrative

With 698 people incarcerated per 

100,000, the United States has the 
second-highest 
incarceration 
rate 

in the world. This mass incarcera-
tion serves to tear apart families and 
communities, while creating a grow-
ing population that, once released, 
will struggle to find jobs and housing 
due to the stigma surrounding incar-
ceration. Although the U.S. prison 
population has grown substantially 
since the 1990s, the U.S. crime rate 
has gone down, and there’s no evi-
dence to suggest that these high 
rates of incarceration have aided in 
 

decreasing crime.

Allowing this prison to reopen puts 

Michigan on the wrong side of crimi-

nal justice reform. An industry that 
relies on mass incarceration to profit 
will not work to rehabilitate prison-
ers, but will instead strive to keep 
more prisoners for longer periods of 
time. It should be noted, however, that 
the Michigan legislature has taken 
some steps in the right direction. 
Newly introduced House bills would 
end mandatory two-year sentences 
for first-time felony firearm charges, 
giving judges more discretion in sen-
tencing. They would also allow these 
sentences to be served concurrently 
with the sentences for the underly-
ing offenses. This is what Michigan 
needs for criminal justice reform, 
not another private prison.

FROM THE DAILY

Problematic privatization

New legislation incentivizes mass incarceration

T

uesday, Gov. Rick Snyder (R) signed a bill permitting a closed 
correctional facility in Northern Michigan to reopen and 
operate as a privatized prison under the authority of the GEO 

Group of Florida. The new legislation provides for the upheaval of a 
restriction that previously prevented the Baldwin area prison in Lake 
County from housing inmates categorized under the highest security 
level, designated by a “Level 5” category. The intent of the legislation 
was to promote job creation and alleviate economic hardship in one of 
the state’s poorest regions. Under its new operation, the facility will 
house roughly 1,675 inmates from other states, such as Vermont and 
Washington. While the legislation provides some economic incentive 
— roughly 150 jobs — to Lake County, the privatization of the Bald-
win facility only exacerbates existing issues surrounding the country’s 
high rates of mass incarceration as well as issues of safety and human 

rights violations.

MELISSA 
SCHOLKE


F

orgive me for being late 
to the game, but I start-
ed “Entourage” a couple 

of weeks ago. It 
only took a few 
minutes 
(and 

several hand-
fuls of tortilla 
chips) 
before 

I was sucked 
into the world 
of Vinny Chase 
and Ari Gold. 
And I admit, 
I’ve loved every 
second of it. I 
finished 
Sea-

son 4 on Tues-
day and am trying to finish as soon 
as possible so I can see the movie.

It’s funny. It’s witty. It’s enter-

taining. And because of that, it’s 
quickly become one of my all-time 
favorite TV shows (next to “The 
Wire” and “Breaking Bad”).

That said, there’ve been sev-

eral questions I’ve been wres-
tling with in between my binge 
sessions: If this show premiered 
today — brand new — would it 
be as successful as it has been? 
Would people still think Ari’s 
harassment of his gay assistant 
Lloyd is acceptable and contin-
ue watching week after week? 
Would Vince and Co.’s constant 
attempts to seduce women be 
seen as just “guys being guys” 
or rather as perpetuating a 
 

misogynistic culture?

I don’t know for sure, but I’m 

willing to bet the show would be 
much more heavily criticized. I’m 
even questioning if I should be 
finding all of this as enjoyable as I 
do. Because, even with all the bla-
tant homophobia and misogyny, I 
can’t get enough of it. (I watched 
six episodes Monday night!)

My feelings toward “Entou-

rage” lend themselves to a con-
versation about the supposed 
“politically correct culture” we 
live in. Some argue it’s positive 
because it’s a good thing to be 
conscientious of others’ feelings 
and stories. Others argue it’s 
negative because we have to live 
walking on our tiptoes in fear of 
offending someone.

I love comedy — from TV shows 

to stand-up, I’m always watching 
— but I’ve also written about how 
the use of derogatory terms with-
out reason has become too perva-
sive and is just plain wrong.

I don’t know if not wanting 

to hear words like “faggot” used 
pointlessly makes me a promoter 

of P.C. culture or not, but accord-
ing to one of my favorite comedi-
ans, Jerry Seinfeld, P.C. culture 
has become a danger to comedy.

On Monday, Seinfeld went 

on Colin Cowherd’s ESPN radio 
show and was asked by Cow-
herd, “Does the climate worry 
you now? … I’ve talked to Chris 
Rock and Larry the Cable Guy, 
they don’t even want to do college 
campuses anymore.”

“I hear that all the time,” Sein-

feld responded. “I don’t play col-
leges, but I hear a lot of people 
tell me, ‘Don’t go near colleges. 
They’re so P.C.’”

Seinfeld continued by giving an 

example of his daughter using the 
term “sexist” incorrectly before 
claiming, “They (the newer gen-
eration, I’m guessing) just want 
to use these words. That’s rac-
ist. That’s sexist. That’s preju-
diced. They don’t even know what 
they’re talking about.”

Cowherd then asked him if 

P.C. culture hurts comedy, to 
which he responded, “Yes it does. 
Yes it does.”

Another comedian, Chris Rock, 

said in a November 2014 inter-
view that he stopped performing 
at colleges in part because, “You 
can’t even be offensive on your 
way to being inoffensive.”

What bothers me about these 

comments is that it seems Sein-
feld and Rock have accepted that 
P.C. culture is static. It cannot be 
changed. It is what it is.

The problem is that’s not how 

culture works. Culture evolves. 
It is malleable, moldable and 
changeable, albeit not without 
a fight. If that wasn’t the case, 
then how is the increasing sup-
port for gay marriage over the last 
decade possible? How did women 
eventually gain the right to vote 
in the 1920s? That’s right, the 
 

culture changed.

Comedy is a unique place 

to effect social and political 
change. There is no denying 
the effect Jon Stewart, Stephen 
Colbert, Bill Maher and George 
Carlin, to name a few, have had 
on exposing huge problems in 
our society. So, why are we see-
ing other prominent comedians 
seemingly back away from this 
challenge to shape the conversa-
tion about important issues?

Having been on this campus 

for three years and seen P.C. cul-
ture in action, there have been 
many positive benefits to come 
out of it. Yes, you should be aware 

of the identities of the people 
who you are talking to. Yes, you 
should check your privilege 
often. And yes, there is a time, 
place and way to have serious 
discussions about race, sex and 
socioeconomic status.

But that doesn’t mean it’s all 

perfect. Maybe, at times, we as 
college students are too worried 
about offending each other, so we 
avoid having the important con-
versations that need to be had. 
Maybe our obsession with creat-
ing “safe spaces” has actually led 
to us being unsafe because we are 
blinding ourselves from reality. 
And maybe our desire to com-
pletely eradicate bias from our 
curriculum is actually hindering 
our education because professors 
are people, too, with their own 
stories and understandings of the 
world, for better or worse.

This brings me back to com-

edy. Comedy plays an important 
role in developing our culture. It 
serves to highlight the flaws and 
even the positives. Perhaps that’s 
why I enjoy “Entourage” so much. 
While I believe the goal of the 
show is for nothing more than 
entertainment, it succeeds in its 
commentary on homophobia and 
misogyny. Though not explicitly 
doing so, the show is rejecting this 
kind of culture, not supporting it. 
The guys’ behavior is so absurd 
that I’m left with no choice to 
view it as such. And that’s why I 
find it so funny; it’s so not relat-
able to me that my reaction is to 
laugh. And although their actions 
can be construed as offensive — 
I’m often uncomfortable watch-
ing it — its overall message is not.

My point is that sometimes 

you have to see the outrageous 
and disgusting to understand and 
reject the outrageous and disgust-
ing. To use Chris Rock’s words, 
you sometimes have to tolerate 
hearing the offensive on your way 
to hearing the inoffensive.

This isn’t the time for comedy 

to back away. We need it more 
than ever to help us learn what 
to make of everything that goes 
on. It can educate us on what 
prejudice really is when the term 
is getting thrown around so fre-
quently. Comedy can help mold 
our culture for the better.

So, Jerry, I have a different 

“P.C.” for you. Please come. Ann 
Arbor is nice in the summer.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com OPINION

hype to help avoid the oblivion 
of cultural irrelevance, the social 
media manifesto draws attention 
to pervasive issues of subtle sex-
ism in the music industry. The 
media — rather than discuss the 
music or any other career-related 
endeavors — focuses upon a few 
sensationalized tenets of a female 
musician’s life: her appearance, 
her romantic life or feuds with 
other artists. Before the release 
of 1989 for example, Taylor Swift 
was notorious for supposedly 
exhibiting a revolving door syn-
drome when it came to boyfriends.

A quote from the musician Beth 

Jeans Houghton, also known as 
Du Blonde, demonstrates another 
perspective on 
the 
pervasive 

nature of the 
sexism 
female 

artists 
experi-

ence. 
Hough-

ton 
expressed 

that “the more 
annoying stuff 
is 
the 
really 

blasé, off-hand 
comments you 
have to deal with every day and 
that you are supposed to ‘get over 
because it doesn’t really matter.’”

The sexism may be subtle, but 

it extends to female participation 
in every realm of society. It’s the 
redundant, demeaning narrative 
that stubbornly refuses to vacate 
the media landscape. Magazine 
headlines and web story head-
lines thrive off of scrutinizing and 
appraising women’s appearances 
as they go about their daily lives. 
Women lose autonomy in media 
coverage as they become objects 
or extensions of their significant 
other. Within a space of maybe six 
to 10 words, a woman’s past accom-
plishments 
are 
overshadowed 

by the outfit she chose to wear or 
whether or not she looks tired.

Stepping outside of the enter-

tainment industry into the world 
of public policy where media cov-
erage is supposedly more serious 
in nature, emphasis upon a female 
politician’s appearance continues to 
possess far too much clout. In fact, 
a 2013 study conducted by Name It. 
Change It. found that discussions of 
a female politician’s appearance — 
whether they’re favorable in nature 
or not — negatively influences voter 
perceptions of that candidate. Even 
after the ridiculously immense 
amount of commentary on the sub-
ject last election season, the noto-
riety of Hillary Clinton’s pant suits 
can’t be suppressed as recent arti-
cles discuss the exorbitant price of 

the garments. 
Considering 
the 
plethora 

of 
campaign 

platforms and 
stances 
to 

consider 
and 

weigh against 
one 
another, 

details 
about 

a 
politician’s 

appearance are 

in no way beneficial to voters.

I realize that in my attempt to 

diversify my writing and find a 
creative solution, I stumbled on 
one of the most redundant narra-
tives in our media landscape. What 
I’ve stated isn’t revolutionary. 
Rather, it’s a subject that’s yet to be 
resolved even though it’s been reit-
erated ad nauseam. One could even 
call these media portrayals cliché. 
It’s common sense to say the media 
needs to stop objectifying women 
in order to sell subscriptions or 
produce extra content.

However, the thing about cli-

chés is that eventually people 
realize that it’s poor taste to keep 
using them.

Indie-folk Accidentals 
rock the Ark with guests

CONCERT REVIEW

By KIM BATCHELOR

Daily Arts Writer

Last Sunday, The Ark was 

filled for the indie-folk-rock 
styling of The Accidentals and, 
opening act, Abigail Stauffer. 
And these girls can seriously 
rock.

Abigail Stauffer, an Ann Arbor 

icon most well-known for her 
dreadlocks, opened the show 
with the title track of her new 
album, Where I’m Going. She 
explained that the last time she 
and The Accidentals had played 
together at The Ark was for the 
debut of her album —The Acci-
dentals opened for her, and she 
said she was excited to return 
the favor. Despite some feedback 
issues and the jocular threat 
of a naked cellist, Stauffer and 
her accompanying cellist, Dave 
Haughey, set the mood right. 
Stauffer brings rich, dark, ring-
ing vocals to her folksy acoustic 
sound. Her songs explore iden-
tity and inner power. Her music 
complements The Accidentals 
well and got the crowd excited 
for the epic folk-rock to come.

The Accidentals are fronted 

by singers and multi-instru-
mentalists Katie Larson and 
Savannah Bruist, along with 
drummer, bassist and backup 
vocalist Michael Dause. Katie’s 
jazzy alto twang and Savan-
nah’s ethereal soprano com-
bine together in some complex 
and stunning harmonies. They 
bring an impressive variety in 
their instrumental work. Within 
one show, be prepared to hear, 
the violin, the cello, the bass 
and acoustic and electric gui-
tars masterfully played, while 
Michael adds a subtle beat pre-
ferring drum bushes to sticks. 
They also brought with them a 
variety of friends. They invited 
The Appleseed Collective, a local 
favorite, on stage to sing with 
them. In a flurry of stringed 
instruments, they brought the 
kind of old-fashioned folk that 
makes you long for a sunset on 
the front porch of farmhouse.

Finally taking the stage, the 

trio 
began 
with 
“Epitaphs.” 

Despite speaking on the sub-
ject of capitalism, “Epitaphs” 

calls forth a sort of carefree and 
upbeat emotion. It is a summer 
song, reminding the listener of 
fresh grass. The group played 
a number of new songs, such as 
“Parking Lot,” which was writ-
ten to highlight their string work, 
and “Common Crisis.” They also 
pulled out some old classics, such 
as “Tangled Red and Blue” from 
their first album, “The Sound a 
Watch Makes When Enveloped 
in Cotton,” the title of which 
came from a short story, and 
“Requiem for a Lark” whose mel-
ody is borrowed from Bartók’s 
“Romanian Folk Dances.”

They also brought surprises. 

One such surprise was a folk song 
which included rap sections by 
Rick Chyme. Others came in the 
form of the source of the music. 
They utilized, for one, a home-
made cello made out of a large 
barrel, which they have titled the 
Cauldron Cello, and integrated a 
knuckle crack in the song “Trou-
ble.” 
Additionally, 
they 
per-

formed a cover of “All About that 
Bass” by Meghan Trainor entire-
ly on bass guitar, with Dause 
taking lead, which was met with 
great approval. Everyone joined 
in to sing along at the end with 
the unusual cover.

The 
Accidentals 
were 
not 

afraid to take risks, often leaving 
the comfort of the stage to drag 
their instruments down into the 
audience for a more intimate 
music experience. A notable 
example of this was during the 
song “Nightlife,” during which 

they placed themselves back 
to back in the center of an aisle 
and slowly rotated to expose dif-
ferent sections of the audience 
to different harmonies as they 
played. It was an interesting idea 
and something I had person-
ally never seen before; however, 
it made it rather difficult to see 
from the other side of the room.

A real standout was a song 

they had written barely a week 
ago titled “Michigan and Again 
and Again and Again and Again” 
— a rather repetitive title. This 
song was a love letter to the state 
of Michigan, referencing state 
staples such as the fir trees and 
the chilly temperature of the 
lake water. This song somehow 
managed to make me homesick 
for a state I was currently in.

The final song, a swing song, 

brought the entire cast of musi-
cians back on stage. This finale 
impressed upon the audience the 
talent of the men and women on 
stage, featuring jazz-style solos 
from each member and multiple 
instruments, including a standup 
bass, a washboard and even what 
appeared to be a bike bell.

These are the kind of musi-

cians whose songs will be stuck 
in your head for the next month, 
whose shows you will frequent 
avidly for years to come and 
whose merch you will rep proud-
ly — lest we forget to mention the 
cat socks.

When looking for your new 

musical obsession, look no fur-
ther.

‘Skin’ has its 
highs and lows

ALBUM REVIEW

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Arts Writer

With a crash, a boom and 

a scream, Of Monsters and 
Men glided onto the indie pop 
music 
circuit 

in 
2010 
to 

immense criti-
cal 
acclaim. 

Their 
fresh-

man 
album, 

My Heart is 
An 
Animal, 

climbed 
the 

international 
music 
charts 

with the then-
ubiquitous 
delicious pop hit “Little Talks.” 
My Heart is An Animal filled audi-
toriums with foot stomping, ebul-
lient audiences that shouted back 
the joyful and usually nature-
based lyrics of the Icelandic band. 
By fully understanding, por-
traying and then utilizing their 
undeniably delightful otherness, 
Of Monsters and Men has never 
filled a need — it created one. 

It’s unsurprising, then, that 

their sophomore album, Beneath 
the Skin, is shrouded in excited 
expectancies. Their vast array 
of fans — ranging in ages from 
young to old and in tastes from 
pop to indie — have held a hope-
ful anticipation for an album of 
deep drum kicks and on-the-beat 
shouted “heys!” to guide them 
through their 2016 summer. Ele-
vated expectations, however, are 
typically tied to disappointment. 
Such is the plight that is Of Mon-
sters and Men’s secondary musical 
attempt. <em>Beneath the Skin</
em> shouldn’t be named a com-
plete failure, but nor should it be 
titled a decided success. Instead, 
it can be accepted as an interesting 
project that leaves a listener sup-
portive yet indifferent. 

From the earliest notes and 

sweet sings of the album’s opener, 
“Crystals,” Of Monsters and Men 
delineate some musical and emo-
tional growth that surely guided 
the production of this album. It’s 
a roaring track with perfect cre-
scendos, a heavy melody and fan-
tastic drum fills. The “woahs” that 
indie audiences so particularly 
admired on My Heart is An Animal 

reappear here, surely to be shout-
ed again in the summer’s concert 
crowds. When stretched from song 
to song, however, the constants of 
Beneath the Skin are revealed. The 
drums fills, animalistic lyricism 
and conversation of female and 
male vocals by lead singers Nanna 
Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir and Rag-
nar bórhallsson are entertaining, 
sometimes. “Crystals,” “Slow Life” 
and “Thousand Eyes” hold levels 
of production that are nearly per-
fect. The futuristic, foreign vocals 
of Nanna follow in the footsteps 
of 2010’s “Little Talks.” Acoustic 
foundations are elevated by the 
insertion of electric guitars that 
create more layered, beautifully 
confused melodies. 

Despite the album’s electri-

cal risks and the band’s recreated 
talents, Beneath the Skin isn’t as 
jarring or exciting as their first 
recorded attempt. When mea-
sured, the songs that feel original, 
inspired or create viscerally excit-
ing are weighed down by the ethe-
real but all-too-airy tracks. “Black 
Water,” “I of the Storm” and “We 
Sink,” for example, are simple 
songs holding pristine levels of 
production that render them soni-
cally beautiful. But they flow from 
one to the other, differing little in 
their style and sound. 

The tempestuous turns and 

twists in the band’s instrumenta-
tion deny any assertion of one-
time or undeserved success. At its 
best, Beneath the Skin is a musi-
cal thunderstorm that seemed to 
emerge from the forests of Iceland. 
Emerging from the rough of their 
foreign island, Of Monsters and 
Men have created an animalistic 
album only to be derailed by a cou-
ple rather uninteresting attempts. 
It’s hard to deny the boring that 
belies the exciting when the lat-
ter is so clearly outnumbered. But 
despite the band’s failed, slowed 
departures on Beneath the Skin, 
their indie pop themes haven’t 
escaped them yet. The driving 
qualities of this band’s success — 
those crescendos, screams and 
lyrical conversations that created 
their sweeping fan base and sup-
port — remain clear: As Nanna’s 
melodic scream so perfectly puts 
it on “Thousand Eyes,” “I am the 
storm.”

‘Aloha’ A-no-ha

FILM REVIEW

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

Perhaps we should have heed-

ed Amy Pascal’s warning about 
“Aloha” during the Sony e-mail 
leak 
last 

December — “I 
don’t care how 
much 
I 
love 

the 
director 

and the actors 
— it never, not 
even once, ever 
works.” A harsh 
assessment by 
someone who is deeply financially 
invested in it, but one that rings 
true for this disjointed and disap-
pointing ode to the trials of love.

The film tries desperately to 

cover too many bases and half-ass-
es most of them. The protagonist, 
infamous space-obsessed Air Force 
veteran Brian Gilchrist (Bradley 
Cooper, “American Sniper”) goes to 
Hawaii to work with the incredibly 
wealthy Carson Welch (Bill Mur-
ray, “Caddyshack”). Welch has a 
dream of privatizing space flight. 
Gilchrist is there for his inexpli-
cably strong connection to both 
Hawaii and the leader of the native 
locals, Dennis “Bumpy” Kana-
heele, who appeared as himself. 
He must get the approval of Bumpy 
and a blessing ceremony before 
they can launch the rockets. 

In the classic fashion of direc-

tor Cameron Crowe, whose other 
credits include “Jerry McGuire” 
and 
“Elizabethtown” 
Gilchrist 

plays the tortured male asshole, 
and a beautiful woman comes along 
who is fascinated by his “mystery.” 
In “Aloha”, there are two. There is 
the ex-girlfriend, Tracy, (Rachel 
McAdams, “About Time”) who 
after having two children with 
her stoic husband, Woody, (John 
Krasinki, “Big Miracle”) and about 
13 years to get over it, is still itch-
ing to tell Gilchrist exactly what is 
wrong with him and how much she 
loved him. But also along for the 
ride is Gilchrist’s Air Force escort, 
Allison Ng, (Emma Stone, “Bird-
man”) an earnest professional who 
wants to explore this conundrum 
of a man. To add to the compound-
ed chaos, there are several misled 
subplots about the occupation of 
Hawaii, children and a mysteri-
ous space mission. Crowe seems 
to want to put every thought about 
Hawaii that he has ever had, and 
the messy outcome is a half-assed 

presentation of these topics. 

Adding insult to injury is the 

almost completely illogical script. 
The actors do what they can with 
it, but with lines like “You’re going 
to skin your knees on eternity, bro” 
and “I’ve lone-wolfed it all the 
way,” there was never much hope 
for it. The characters can barely 
communicate with each other, was 
demonstrated in one scene when 
Woody and Gilchrist must use sub-
titles to explain the male body lan-
guage that apparently lends itself 
to telepathy. The only one to occa-
sionally break out of the monotony 
of what sounds like an angsty teen-
aged love letter was Bradley Coo-
per, but even his best moments of 
acting were brought down by those 
around him. The biggest anchor 
was Ng, through no fault of Emma 
Stone. Ng is written as two entirely 
different people occupying the 
same body. One minute, she’s all 
salutes and fast talk about planes 
and the next she’s a ridiculous 
romantic flirting with Gilchrist. 
The conflicting sides of her person-
ality make her incredibly difficult 
to take seriously. 

Much of the criticism about 

the character of Ng has risen 
not from her annoying multiple 
personalities, but from her con-
stantly proclaimed racial identity. 
Ng is supposed to be Hawaiian 
and Swedish, but Stone’s clearly 
white, blue-eyed and blonde exte-
rior is seen as a direct offense 
to the possibility for an Asian 
American or genuinely Hawaiian 
woman as a lead role in a major 
movie. The rest of the movie is 
similarly unkind in their repre-
sentation of the Hawaiian people. 
The only native Hawaiian with a 
speaking role is Bumpy, and the 
rest of the Hawaiian cast mem-
bers are portrayed as intimi-
dating bikers or hula girls. The 
people, along with their customs 
and traditions, are objects in the 
background used to move the plot 
to its final destination. 

It isn’t that I don’t want to see 

a cute rom-com about Hawaii or 
that I don’t want to see Emma 
Stone and Bill Murray in a drunk-
en dance-off — of course I want 
those things. I’m only human. But 
I don’t want it to be filler distract-
ing from an inherently flawed 
and careless movie. Next time we 
graciously receive a warning from 
the likes of Amy Pascal, we ought 
to take it more seriously.

‘UnREAL’ may be real

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

It’s no secret that reality TV 

competitions are falling fast. CBS’s 
“Survivor” is just barely surviv-
ing, the CW’s “America’s Next Top 
Model” is raking 
the bottom of the 
viewership barrel 
and FOX’s once-
goliath 
“Ameri-

can 
Idol” 
has 

finally bitten the 
dust. The truth 
is, 
times 
have 

changed — what 
piqued our interest in 2005 is dra-
matically different 10 years later. 
What’s in today are smart, binge-
worthy sitcoms and dramas and 
reality shows that don’t pretend to 
be sincere. What’s out are the real-
ity competition shows that walk the 
line between real and rigged, with 
contestants who are pathetic at 
best and cringe-worthy at worst — 
whose behind-the-scenes agendas 
are the most appalling of all.

And yet, people still watch them. 

There’s a reason tabloids like Peo-
ple and Us Weekly have latched 
onto ABC’s “Bachelor” and “Bach-
elorette” franchise, splashing the 
shows’ latest upsets across their 
covers. Whether viewers watch for 
the cat fights or the over-the-top 
dates, the hot guys or the shocking 
confessions, they’re engrossed in 
the “realness” of it all — the girls 
may be fake, the guys in it for the 
fame, but it’s still a reality show, 
no? The bachelor still ends up pick-
ing “the one” and the in-it-for-the-
wrong-reasons jerks get filtered 
out, right? 

Not so fast. In “UnREAL,” Life-

time’s 
newest 
comedy-drama, 

what’s behind the camera comes to 
the forefront — and it’s not all roses 
and romance. The show centers on a 
show-within-a-show called “Ever-
lasting,” a reality romance competi-
tion so familiar that it might as well 
be called “The Bachelor”: there’s a 
hot and eligible British suitor, Adam 
Cromwell (Freddie Stroma, “Harry 
Potter and the Half Blood Prince”), 
who’s given the task of finding his 
perfect match from a lineup of 20 or 
so hot and eligible girls. 

As Adam waits outside the can-

dlelit castle (emphasis on the can-
dles; more on that later), the girls 
filter out of limousines, trying their 
damnedest to make a sexy first 
impression while also proving that 
they’re serious wife material. At the 
end of the night, Adam dons roses to 
the lucky girls while the losers get 
loaded back into the limo. And then 
the real fun begins. 

That’s what they want you to 

think, anyway. Pan out from the 
sipping-champagne-in-the-limo 
camera shot and you’ll find Rachel 
(Shiri Appleby, “Swimfan”), clad in 
a “this is what feminism looks like” 
T-shirt, lying between stilettos on 
the limousine floor and looking 
utterly disgusted. She’s revealed to 
be a producer who’s given instruc-
tions via mic by Quinn (Constance 
Zimmer, “Entourage”), the show’s 
executive producer who makes 
Cruella de Vil look like Molly Wea-
sley. But Rachel’s role isn’t just to 
make sure sequins are in place and 
champagne glasses are filled. She’s 
more of a puppeteer. The game is 
simple: Quinn labels the girls and 
arranges the drama, then Rachel 
pulls at their strings to make them 
dance. Ever notice why the shows 
always have a drama queen, a 
virgin, a single mom and a cold-

hearted villain? Because their roles 
make for good “reality” TV, as do 
dozens of other details, such as the 
sea of candles and the masterfully 
manipulated confessions. Or even 
the first of the first impressions: 
Quinn quickly cuts the scene when 
a Black contestant is the first to exit 
the limo, for the first girl must be 
“wifey” material (“It’s not my fault 
America’s racist!” she explains). 

But wait, Rachel’s a feminist — at 

least according to her T-shirt and a 
comment about her women’s stud-
ies degree — so why is she here? It 
turns out some of the producers do 
have souls, or did anyway. In a few 
“Everlasting” 
seasons 
previous, 

Rachel had a raging meltdown at 
the show’s finale that resulted in a 
devastated contestant, a stolen car 
and a lockdown in rehab. Despite 
the incident, since no one can top 
Rachel’s eye for drama, Quinn 
wanted her back — and she’s hang-
ing a jail sentence over Rachel’s 
head as incentive. 

If nothing else, “UnREAL” is 

catchy because of its originality. 
And, apparently, its authenticity: 
written by former “Bachelor” pro-
ducer Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, 
whose short film “Sequin Raze” 
inspired the show, the documen-
tary feel of the set makes it all the 
more startling. It makes you pity 
the producers, for they’re slaves to 
ratings charts. It makes you pity the 
contestants, because they’re simply 
role-casted meat puppets. It makes 
you ponder the difference between 
“reality” and “scripted” TV, about 
whether the latter can be more 
truthful than the former.

But even as “UnREAL” pulls at 

your heartstrings and twists your 
stomach, you can’t help but wonder 
if it’s manipulating you, too.

someone is going to roll down it,” 
Mendeloff said.

However, she said, because 

of the unpredictability of out-
door performances, casting has 
increased throughout the years.

“All roles are double cast. 

That means that we have two 
of everything,” Mendeloff said. 
“Sometimes, we’re even triple-
cast. Because things happen in 
the woods, you know. Ankles get

The surrounding nature also

I’ve always sort of envisioned

Gray has been with Shake-

She said while the core move-

that we can use.”

One such the facility is the 

UM3D Lab, which had a live

The UM3D Lab, part of the Digi-

“With Liberal Studies, I was

Summit condemns sexual 
assault, fosters dialogue 
Conference features 

remarks from 

Michigan politicians 

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Summer Managing News Editor

Amid Department of Educa-

tion investigations of various 
Michigan institutions’ sexual 
misconduct policies, including 
that of the University, state first 
lady Sue Snyder collaborated 
with Michigan politicians and 
educators in an effort to address 
issues of sexual assault on cam-
puses. 

Snyder hosted the “Let’s End 

Campus Sexual Assault” sum-
mit, an event designed to foster 
dialogue between leadership in 
government and education and 
the public. Held in Lansing, the 
conference 
featured 
remarks 

from campus sexual assault sur-
vivors, 
state 
representatives, 

and congressmen and educators 
from across the state. 

During her remarks, Snyder 

lauded Michigan colleges and 
universities for taking steps to 
prevent sexual assault, but said 
there is still more work to be 
done. 

“I have no doubt that together 

we will set a positive example 

and make Michigan a leader in 
the fight against sexual assault 
on our college and university 
campuses,” Snyder said. “While 
we may not like to believe it, 
sexual assault can happen any-
where and to anyone. Our colleg-
es and universities are already 
taking positive steps to prevent 
these crimes. But there’s always 
more that can be done. It is my 
hope that we can build on these 
efforts.”

Gov. Rick Snyder (R) echoed 

her remarks, and said the focus 
of the summit should be brain-
storming ways to offer support 
to survivors of sexual assault. 

“This is not about politics, 

this is not about party, this is 
about 
helping 
people,” 
Sny-

der said. “What can we do to 
stop it, prevent it, make sure it 
never happens again? And in 
the meantime, what can we do 
to provide better support for 
the people who have suffered 
through these terrible acts?”

In accordance with the Snyder 

administration, Col. Kriste Kib-
bey Etue, director of the Michi-
gan State Police, announced an 
allocation of $500,000 in the 
2016 state budget for imple-
menting best practices of sexual 
assault prevention on college 
campuses. 

A portion of the event was 

also 
dedicated 
to 
educating 

attendees about the scientific 
and psychological elements of 
sexual assault. Wayne State 
Prof. Antonia Abbey shared her 
research on the role of alcohol in 
cases of sexual assault; Rebecca 
Campbell, a psychology profes-
sor at Michigan State Univer-
sity, discussed the neurological 
effects victims of sexual assault 
may experience. 

The summit also engaged with 

the public remotely. Remarks, 
discussions and breakout ses-
sions were all streamed live 
online throughout the duration 
of the conference. Additionally, 
Twitter users contributed to 
discussions by tweeting using 
the hashtag #MISaferCampus. 

“Glad to see the level of com-

mitment at the #MISaferCam-
pus summit,” one user tweeted. 
“Every deserves to #LiveWith-
outFear.” 

In a statement to the press, 

Congresswoman Debbie Ding-
ell (D–Mich.), who also par-
ticipated in the conference, said 
sexual assault should not be an 
accepted trend, and that Michi-
gan should be a leading state in 
ending campus sexual assault. 

“Today, one in five women 

are assaulted during their col-
lege years, and Michigan can, 
and should, lead the country in

ending assault on college cam-
puses,” she said. “Today’s sum-
mit was a critical first step. By 
bringing together stakeholders 
from both sides of the aisle to 
listen and learn and discuss best 
practices, we can find ways to 
educate students, empower sur-
vivors and prevent sexual assault 
on our campuses and around the 
country.”

State Sens. Tonya Schuitmaker 

(R–Lawton) and Rebekah War-
ren (D–Ann Arbor), and state 
Reps. Laura Cox (R–Livonia) and 
Marilyn Lane (D–Fraser) held a 
panel discussion to brainstorm 
ways the state of Michigan could 
be a leader in combating cam-
pus sexual assaults. Debi Cain, 
executive director of the Michi-
gan Domestic and Sexual Vio-
lence Prevention and Treatment 
Board, also participated in the 
discussion. 

During the panel, Warren, who 

is a representative of Ann Arbor 
and Washtenaw County, said it 
is vital that the state encour-
ages victims to report crimes of 
sexual assault by implementing 
stronger mandates on testing 
rape kits. 

“We know that this is one of 

the most underreported crimes 
that we have, and one of the rea-
sons is that people are worried 

that they won’t be believed or 
if they will get the justice that 
they seek,” Warren said. “Those 
untested rape kits I think hang 
over our head as something we 
have to resolve to show people 
that we will take their cases seri-
ously that they will get the jus-
tice that they need.”

Warren said legislature has 

taken steps to appropriate funds 
in two budgets that will go 
toward requiring stricter time-
lines for rape kit testing. 

“Any new victims that are in 

a position of having to decided 
whether they will come forward 
or not should know that they will 
get treated with dignity they 
deserve,” she said. 

In her remarks at the end of 

the conference, Sue Snyder said 
she was encouraged by the pro-
ductive conversations the con-
ference prompted. 

“This inaugural summit has 

been one of the most encourag-
ing things that I have been a part 
of,” she said. “The outpouring of 
support and dedication signifies 
a positive for this effort.” 

Snyder also said continued 

dialogues about sexual assault 
awareness and prevention are

As Kelis’ 2003 hit song “Milk-

shake” blared throughout Elbel 
Field, Wilton Speight, nicknamed 
“Grande,” strode to the plate.

This isn’t a Mad Lib, I promise.
The hip-hop singer confident-

ly discussed how her milkshake 
brought all the boys to the yard, 
and on the first pitch, the sopho-
more quarterback nearly sent the 
ball out of it. It didn’t clear the 
fence, but was high enough and 
deep enough to cause left-fielder 
Kevin Lohan and centerfielder 
Tyler Motte to collide.

Speight 
took 

advantage of the 
miscue, quickly 
lugging 
every 

ounce 
of 
his 

6-foot-5, 
245-

pound 
frame 

around the bases. 
As he crossed 
home plate and 
nearly took out junior fullback 
Wyatt Shallman, who was merely 
attempting a celebratory hug, the 
bench quickly mobbed him like his 
shot had earned six points at Mich-
igan Stadium.

While most of Ann Arbor’s eyes 

were on Oklahoma City — where 
the Michigan softball team simul-
taneously played a fateful Game 3 of 
the Women’s College World Series 
Championship — “The Team,” an 
intramural softball team composed 
entirely of Michigan football play-
ers, had just evened the score at 
three against “Servi’sBoys,” a team 
comprised entirely of Michigan 

hockey players in Michigan’s Intra-
mural Slowpitch Softball Champi-
onship.

Just one at-bat later, fellow 

quarterback and rising junior 
Shane Morris, batting to Shakira’s 
“Hips Don’t Lie,” belted an equally 
impressive shot to left-centerfield.

Like Shakira’s hips, Lohan — 

who moonlighted as a sophomore 
defenseman during the school year 
— refused to put on the façade of a 
defensive effort, staying put while 
the ball rolled to the fence. Morris 
cruised around to give his team a 
lead it would never relinquish.

Behind Morris’ three runs, The 

Team overcame an early 3-0 defi-

cit to take down 
Servi’sBoys, 
18-7, to capture 
a championship 
and the oft-cov-
eted T-shirts.

“The T-shirt 

means 
every-

thing to us,” said 
self-proclaimed 

team manager and owner Jared 
Wangler, who redshirted as a 
freshman linebacker on the foot-
ball team last fall. “We lost it last 
year in the semi-finals, and didn’t 
come back for second place. We 
got out in the semis and we’re back 
with a vengeance.”

Motte, who once was a standout 

baseball player and teammate with 
Michigan baseball standout Jacob 
Cronenworth before settling for 
sophomore forward on the hockey 
team, was slightly less enthused 
after the loss.

“To be totally honest, I didn’t 

know we got T-shirts,” he said. 

“But it’s good for them, obviously 
with these two teams in the finals, 
both teams are full of athletes, and 
it’s 
the 
other 

competitive side 
we don’t see of 
each other. Some 
guys are athletic 
enough to come 
out here and look 
like college ball-
players, and some 
guys do it a little 
unorthodoxly, 
but they both get 
it done, and it’s 
good fun for us. But at the end of the 
day, we both want to win.”

At first, it looked like the squad 

Red Berenson built would do just 
that. Jumping out to an early lead, 
boasting more former baseball 
players and besting The Team ear-
lier in the season, 
Motte and his team 
looked far superior 
to Wangler’s squad, 
despite failing to 
acquire a bat from 
the actual Michigan 
softball team.

“They 
couldn’t 

help us out, but 
we’re not messing 
around 
tonight,” 

said 
self-anointed 

power-hitting spe-
cialist and rising-
junior forward Max 
Shuart in the sec-
ond inning. “Hon-
estly, we don’t think 
we’re gonna have 
much of a problem 
with these guys. 

They’re a good team, they’re aver-
age fielders. So if we bring the bats 
tonight I think we’ve got them.”

On the other side, numerous 

players cited the calm presence 
of Wangler and general manager/
rising-junior running back Der-
rick Green for keeping the team 
focused in the early struggles.

“I’m staying with my squad,” 

Green said. “It’s just the beginning, 
we’re all good. Anytime it’s com-
petition, we’re locked in. It doesn’t 
matter if it’s here or in (football) 
practice, we’re trying to find a way 
to win.”

The 
com-

petitive 
nature 

came 
to 
frui-

tion in the third 
inning, 
when 

both teams grew 
frustrated with 
the 
officiating. 

LSA junior and 
umpire Brandon 
Gregg, 
unen-

viably 
caught 

between the largest and strongest 
students on campus, knew it was 

time to put his 
foot down.

“For 
both 

teams, I’ve been 
to most of their 
games, 
so 
I 

wanna see them 
do well, and it 
was cool to see 
them out of their 
element. 
But 

they’re all com-
petitive, so you 

have to make the right call.

“At the beginning of the game, I 

kind of had to lay down the ground 
rules, and held to it. It kept them 
in check.”

Wangler, who missed his sister’s 

graduation for the game despite 

being cut due to “a lot of errors,” 
utilized his time on the bench, pre-
paring the postgame snack, man-
ning DJ duties and keeping the 
team focused on the game plan.

“Our game plan is none — just 

hit the ball,” he told members of 
the team. “Actually, just get on 
base. We’re playing with nine and 
they’re playing with 10. Kind of a 
disadvantage, but we can do it.”

The increase in contact paid 

off. With less-than-optimal con-
ditions, the hockey team failed to 
gain its footing in the field, making 

“at least a dozen” 
errors.

“It’s 
pretty 

wet and nobody’s 
wearing 
cleats 

out here really,” 
Motte said. “It’s 
kinda tough with 
the bright lights 
and the dark sky, 
but it’s good fun 
for the guys, the 
guys are enjoy-

ing it.”

Both teams boasted records of 

5-1 heading into the contest, but 
when push came to shove, the 
hockey team couldn’t keep pace.

With football coach Jim Har-

baugh in Indianapolis for his satel-
lite camps and hockey coach Red 
Berenson away on an annual fish-
ing trip with the team’s graduating 
seniors, it was clear that, despite 
the testy moments, the end goal 
was fun for both teams.

“It’s all about bragging rights,” 

Green said. “They beat us the first 
time, so if we come back and beat 
them, that would be really good.

“But really, just for us to come 

out here a day or two out of the 
week and play something other 
than football, it just makes our 
connection stronger.”

“Our game plan 
is none — just

“It’s all about

They beat us the

second full-court drives are over.

Monday, the NCAA Playing 

Rules Oversight Panel approved a 
proposal to play all women’s bas-
ketball games in four 10-minute 
quarters starting next season.

Under the new format, teams 

will reach the bonus and shoot 
two free throws 
after the fifth 
team 
foul 
in 

every quarter. 
In past seasons, 
teams received 
one-and-one 
foul shot oppor-
tunities begin-
ning with the 
seventh 
team 

foul of a half 
before 
reach-

ing the double bonus (two free 
throws) with the 10th team foul.

Additionally, the new format 

features a rule that allows teams 
to automatically advance the 
ball to the frontcourt following a 
timeout in the final minute of the 
game.

The recommendation was ini-

tially made by the 13-member 
Women’s Basketball Rules Com-
mittee last month, and it aims 
to both “enhance the flow of the 

game” and emulate the rules of 
the WNBA and international 
basketball.

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico, who is working with USA 
Basketball for the second straight 
summer, 
welcomes 
the 
rule 

change as a means of creating a 
more universal game.

“We are excited about the 

changes,” Barnes Arico said. “Our 
game will now more closely mirror 
both the professional and interna-
tional levels of competition, which 

I think is a great 
thing.

“I am very 

fortunate 
to 

have the oppor-
tunity to coach 
with USA Bas-
ketball 
again 

this year, allow-
ing 
me 
the 

chance to play 
with 
interna-

tional rules all 

summer as we prepare for next 
season. Many of the new college 
rules are reflected in the interna-
tional game, so I am really excited 
that I get to experience that before 
the season kicks off in the fall.”

But Barnes Arico understands 

that the new changes will also 
bring a steep learning curve, espe-
cially when it comes to late-game 
strategy.

Games like the Wolverines’ 

one-point loss to Northwestern on 

Feb. 14 — which featured numer-
ous bonus free throw attempts 
down the stretch and culminated 
in a futile near-half-court heave 
by then-senior guard Shannon 
Smith — would certainly have 
unfolded differently under the 
new rules.

“I think that with anything, 

when you make changes like this, 
it is going to take some time to get 
used to,” Barnes Arico said. “We 
always spend parts of practice 
going through situations, espe-
cially end-of-game situations. We 
will continue to do that, but now 
those situations will be a little dif-
ferent and will be a learning expe-
rience for both our players and 
coaches.”

With its eyes on creating a bet-

ter fan experience, the panel also 
approved rules that allow more 
physical post defense and permit 
bands or amplified music to play 
during any dead-ball situation.

In addition to the changes it 

has already approved, the com-
mittee has plans to reduce the 
number of media and team time-
outs per game — an issue that will 
be further discussed in a confer-
ence call on June 24.

“A lot of these changes are 

being made to make the game 
more exciting for fans,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I really think that 
our game is heading in the right 
direction, and I am excited to see 
it.”

The Michigan baseball team 

made its mark on the 2015 Major 
League Baseball First-Year Player 
Draft, as three current Wolverines 
and two incoming freshmen were 
picked in days two and three of the 
three-day draft, which ran from 
Monday to Wednesday.

On Tuesday, junior second 

baseman Jacob Cronenworth and 
senior outfielder Jackson Glines 
were selected in the seventh and 
10th rounds, respectively.

Cronenworth, who went to 

the Tampa Bay Rays, has had an 
award-worthy career at Michi-
gan, playing and starting in all 180 
games of his career. This season, 
the junior received All-Big Ten 
Second Team honors for the sec-
ond time and was named to the 
Big Ten All-Tournament Team, in 
addition to being named the Big 
Ten Tournament Most Outstand-
ing Player. He led the Big Ten with 
91 hits and 62 runs scored on the 
season.

The Chicago White Sox select-

ed Glines, who finished his final 
two seasons at Michigan with a 
.341 career average and 21 sto-
len bases after transferring from 
Fresno City College. The senior 
was named an All-Big Ten first 
team selection in his final season, 
where he posted a .492 slugging 
percentage, after receiving All-

Big Ten second team honors in his 
junior season.

Wednesday, the Kansas City 

Royals selected junior infielder 
Travis Maezes in the 13th round. 
The two-time All-Big Ten third 
team selection has a career .305 
average with 39 doubles, seven 
triples and home runs and 92 RBI. 
His .313 average in his freshman 
campaign was good for Louisville 
Slugger Freshman All-America 
honors.

Joining Maezes on Wednesday 

were incoming freshmen Jonathan 
Englemann and Charlie Donovan. 
Englemann went to the Minnesota 
Twins in the 28th round, while 
the Milwaukee Brewers selected 
Donovan in the 30th round.

Engelmann hit .462 for Burlin-

game High School in San Mateo, 
California, earning Perfect Game 
honorable mention All-American 
honors as well as an all-region 
first team selection in 2015. His 34 
stolen bases in his senior season 
broke the school record.

Donovan, 
the 
2015 
Illinois 

Gatorade Player of the Year, is a 
two-time all-state honoree and 
helped Westmont High School in 
Clarendon Hills, Illinois, to a 30-9 
record and a spot in the Super Sec-
tionals in the IHSA Class 2A State 
championships.

This year’s draft marks the 17th 

in the last 18 years where at least 
one Michigan player has been 
selected.

The Michigan softball team 

was dominant once again in its 
2015 campaign, falling only one 
win short of a National Champion-
ship. With legendary coach Carol 
Hutchins at the helm, the Wolver-
ines finished with a 60-8 record 
and captured Big Ten regular sea-
son and Tournament titles.

A week after Michigan’s sea-

son came to a close at the hands 
of two-time national champion 
Florida, the Daily grades the Wol-
verines’ performances.

Offense: A+

Michigan boasted a potent 

offense this year, leading the 
NCAA with 108 home runs and 
ranking third in runs scored per 
game. The number was good 
enough to break the program’s 
previous single-season home run 
record of 103.

The batting order was solid 

one through nine, with five play-
ers who posted double-digit home 
runs and only two players who 
hit below .300. Those two were 
freshman first baseman Tera 
Blanco and sophomore third base-
man Lindsay Montemarano, but 
despite their batting averages, 

it seemed the duo’s hits came at 
the most opportune times in tight 
games.

Junior second baseman Sierra 

Romero and sophomore left field-
er Kelly Christner headlined the 
offense with respective .449 and 
.393 batting averages. They com-
bined for 150 runs batted in and 
43 home runs, solidifying the duo 
as the best in the country. Argu-
ably the most impressive statistic: 
Romero struck out just eight times 
in 68 games.

In the championship series, 

freshman designated player Aidan 
Falk — a .344 hitter throughout 
the season — was on the bench . 
That alone encapsulates how suc-
cessful this offensive lineup was.

And the success can get even 

better. Of the team’s consistent 
contributors at the plate, only 
senior catcher Lauren Sweet will 
not return.

Defense: A-

The Wolverines were solid on 

the defensive end all year, accu-
mulating a .974 fielding percent-
age. Yet the number earned them 
just 20th in the country, while 
Florida sat atop the category.

That made all the difference 

in the championship series with 
such a slim margin for error. In the 

first game between the two sides, 
an error by sophomore shortstop 
Abby Ramirez turned a solo home 
run into a two-run shot, and that 
entirely altered the outcome of the 
contest, as Michigan lost, 4-3.

But to say that one play encap-

sulates Ramirez’s individual and 
the team’s overall defensive per-
formance this year wouldn’t be 
accurate.

Ramirez, combined with Rome-

ro, made up a consistent middle 
infield that committed just 19 errors 
in 68 games. Both Sweet and junior 
centerfielder Sierra Lawrence had a 
perfect fielding percentage.

Though Montemarano’s .944 

fielding percentage isn’t elite, the 

number couldn’t do her defensive 
performance at third base justice. 
Life at the hot corner isn’t easy, 
but the sophomore made it look 
so with highlight plays seemingly 
every weekend.

Pitching: A

It’s hard to criticize a staff that 

came four runs shy of a National 
Championship.

Michigan’s pitching corps fin-

ished fifth in the nation in earned-
run average, and was second 
among power conference teams. 
Realistically, the combination of 
sophomore right-hander Megan 
Betsa and senior left-hander Hay-
lie Wagner was close to perfect.

The only fault of the staff was 

that the two failed to pitch their 
best at the same time. Wagner 
struggled to reach her previous All-
American status early in the sea-
son, at which point Betsa emerged 
as the Wolverines’ regular season 
ace. But in the World Series, it was 
Betsa who struggled, and Michi-
gan relied on exceptional perfor-
mances from Wagner instead.

At the same time, the fact that 

the pair failed to click simultane-
ously is a testament to the balance 
that this pitching staff exhibited.

After overcoming the adver-

sity of losing senior right-hander 
Sara Driesenga, Betsa and Wag-
ner posted a 1.72 and 1.75 ERA, 
respectively.

Though Wagner will be gone 

next year, Blanco will stay in Ann 
Arbor this summer to work on her 
pitching game, and Driesenga may 
use her redshirt to return for a 
final season in the maize and blue.

Bench: B+

Honestly, the Wolverines didn’t 

have much need to turn to their 
bench. The only time Michigan 
consistently worked with its bench 
was for pinch running and during 
Sweet’s brief leg injury in March.

The pinch running trio — 

juniors Olivia Richvalsky and Mary 
Sbonek and freshman Nikki Wald 
— combined for 48 runs scored.

Falk started all eight games at 

catcher during Sweet’s absence. 
She posted a .556 batting average 
with six RBI and two home runs in 
a three-game series against Ohio 
State, earning her a starting spot 
at designated player after Sweet’s 
return.

The eight-game stretch with-

out the veteran catcher could have 
proved difficult to cope with, but 
Falk ensured that the Wolverines 
didn’t skip a beat.

Coaching: A

Well, this one is easy. In her 31st 

season as head coach, Hutchins 
maintained her typical standard 
of excellence. She and her coach-
ing staff led Michigan through a 
season in which it had just eight 
losses and strung together a 
28-game winning streak.

The coaching staff obviously 

played a role in adapting to the loss 
of Driesenga and Sweet’s brief inju-
ry, while elevating the Wolverines 
from a No. 8 preseason ranking to 
No. 2 to conclude the season.

Really, the only fault was that 

the Wolverines couldn’t capture a 
national championship.
