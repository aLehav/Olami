“You were born on purpose,” 
Yusef Salaam, public speaker and 
one of the Exonerated 5, said. “If 
you were born on purpose, then 
you were born with a purpose.” 
Salaam spoke to a crowd of more 
than 400 people at the Michigan 
Union Ballroom on Monday night. 
Sponsors of the event included 
Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs, the 
Ford School of Public Policy and 

the Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies, among many 
others. 
The Exonerated 5, previously 
known as the Central Park 5, were 
falsely accused of rape in 1989 
and sentenced for up to 13 years 
in prison as teenagers in New 
York. The defendants’ assault 
convictions 
were 
overturned 
in 2002 and the five agreed to a 
$40 million settlement in 2014. A 
Netflix series called “When They 
See Us” shares the true story of 
the Exonerated 5. Salaam was 

only 15 years old when he went to 
prison and was exonerated when 
the actual assailant confessed to 
the Central Park rape. 
DAAS 
Program 
Associate 
Elizabeth James began the event 
with an acknowledgment of the 
Union occupying formerly tribal 
land. MESA staff Leslie Tetteh 
and Saveri Nandigama then gave 
the welcoming address. Three 
poets performed before Salaam 
was introduced to the audience 
with a standing ovation. 

Salaam 
engaged 
with 
the 
audience as he walked across the 
stage multiple times to address 
the large crowd. He shared stories 
about the effects prison had on his 
life and how he grew through his 
incarceration. 
Salaam said an important part 
of his identity is his religion and 
he spoke about how Islam helped 
him grow into a leader during 
and after his time in prison. The 
presence of his religion brought 
him companionship.brought him

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

As Iowans cast the nation’s 
first 
votes 
in 
the 
2020 
Democratic 
Presidential 
primaries 
Monday 
night, 
Iowa 
residents 
living 
in 
Michigan descended on the 
Ann Arbor District Library 
for the state’s only satellite 
caucus. Ann Arbor joined 86 
other satellite locations from 
as far as Paris, France open 
to Iowa Democrats living out 
of the state, as part of a wider 
effort by the Iowa Democratic 
Party to expand accessibility 

in the caucus process. 
The final delegate count 
for the satellite caucus was 
two delegates for Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, 
I-VT, 
and 
two 
delegates for Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren, 
D-Mass. 
Those 
delegates will be factored in 
proportion with results from 
the other satellite caucuses. 
Nine Iowa Democrats were 
caucusing, with more than 
30 
non-Iowan 
community 
members 
observing. 
One 
observer, LSA sophomore Neil 
Jain, said he came because 
he’s 
impressed 
with 
the 
caucus system of selecting a 

candidate. 
“Democracy 
is 
about 
having these conversations,” 
Jain said. “It’s about dissent 
and disagreement and being 
able to work out and discuss 
those differences instead of 
being able to hide away in 
our own little cubicles filling 
out ballots. I’m here to see 
how the process unfolds on a 
microscopic level.”
Non-Iowan 
supporters 
representing 
former 
Vice 
President Joe Biden, South 
Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 
Sen. 
Amy 
Klobuchar, 
D-Minn., 
Sanders, 
Warren 

and 
entrepreneur 
Andrew 
Yang courted voters before the 
caucus began. Many carried 
signs and wore shirts and pins 
supporting their candidate. 
However, 
most 
Iowans, 
including Engineering senior 
Alex 
Skillin, 
had 
already 
made up their mind coming 
into the caucus.
 “I’m pretty well behind 
Warren and I have been for a 
while following the process,” 
Skillin said. “I was back in 
Iowa over break and saw a 
town hall or two.”

As part of LGBTQ Health and 
Wellness Week, the Spectrum 
Center hosted keynote speaker 
Joy Saniyah, a mental health 
professional, at the School of 
Social Work on Monday night. 
Saniyah spoke to a crowd 
of about 25 regarding her 
experience 
as 
a 
therapist, 
registered 
yoga 
teacher 
and 
an 
energy 
healer, 
or 
reiki 
practitioner. 
Saniyah 
explained what freedom and 
self-expression means to her to 
address the guiding question 
“what is right with you?” at the 
event. 
As 
a 
therapist, 
Saniyah 
focuses on creating a space 
where 
any 
marginalized 
group or individual can feel 
supported. As a queer, woman 
of color, Saniyah emphasized 
the importance of feminist 
values, 
especially 
in 
the 
realm of healing. Seven years 
ago, 
Saniyah 
founded 
the 
Integrative 
Empowerment 
Group, a mental health and 
wellness group based in Ann 
Arbor and Ypsilanti. 
Saniyah 
said 
healing 
requires a multidisciplinary 
approach.

Town hall
discusses 
 
two bylaws 
on tenure 

Members 
of 
the 
Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University Affairs hosted the 
faculty tenure bylaw working 
group at Palmer Commons on 
Monday. The group, which 
was 
established 
to 
draft 
recommendations for potential 
changes to Regent’s bylaws 5.09 
and 5.10, presented to about 50 
faculty and staff at a town hall-
style meeting. 
These two bylaws establish 
the processes and practices 
for firing tenured faculty. The 
bylaw working group aims to 
make 
recommendations 
on 
potential amendments that are 
reflective of faculty wishes. The 
group was formed after Music, 
Theatre & Dance professor 
David Daniels was accused of 
sexual assault in August 2018. 
Soon after, Daniels was placed 
on paid leave and the University 
is still in the process of firing 
Daniels. 
Sharon Glotzer, professor and 
chair of Chemical Engineering 
and chair of the faculty working 
group, explained the specific 
purposes of Regents bylaws 
5.09 and 5.10, as well as the 
time period in which they were 
enacted.

Keynote speaker Yusef Salaam details experiences with wrongful 
conviction, exoneration and religion in honor of Black History Month

DAVENPORT, IOWA — Public 
Policy junior Camille Mancuso and 
LSA junior Jordyn Houle stood 
over a kitchen table covered in 
campaign fliers of Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren, D-Mass., at a house serving 
as one of the campaign’s canvassing 
headquarters in Davenport, Iowa on 
Friday. 
Houle and Mancuso, two leaders 
of the University of Michigan’s 
Students for Warren chapter, arrived 
in Iowa late Thursday night with two 
other Students for Warren members 
to spend the weekend canvassing 
for Warren, Democratic presidential 
candidate, ahead of Monday’s Iowa 
caucus. 
They had been planning the 
weekend for a while, along with LSA 
junior Maya Chamra and Engineering 
sophomore Ashvin Kumar. Mancuso 
told The Daily ahead of the trip that 
they’ve been canvassing for Warren 
in Michigan, but they’ve wanted to 
come knock doors in Iowa since the 
end of last semester. 
“We knew it was going to be all 
hands on deck,” Mancuso said. “All of 
the presidential campaigns have sort 
of been cycling with who’s at the top 
of the polls, who’s near the bottom of 

the polls — it sort of changes pretty 
often. So we knew that last weekend 
before the caucus was going to be 
super important to ensure that 
Elizabeth Warren is successful in 
Iowa.”
In the kitchen, the students 
listened to Jean Simpson, Davenport 
resident and a canvass captain for the 
Warren campaign as she explained 
door-knocking routes and how to 
report responses from residents. 
“What we’re going to do is I’m 
going to give you a script,” Simpson 
told the group. “You’re each going 
to get a clipboard, and that will have 
your script and everything you need, 
and I’m going to go through that 
now.” 
“I guess I’m skipping class on 
Monday.”
Students 
from 
several 
other 
University of Michigan groups also 
planned canvassing trips in Iowa this 
weekend to participate in the lead-up 
to the caucus. 
LSA senior Jessica Kosticak was 
inspired to start Students for Pete at 
the University after a November trip 
to Iowa for Pete Buttigieg, the mayor 
of South Bend, Ind., and the youngest 
candidate in the race. When she 
heard the friends she’d made on that 
trip were going back to the state 
for the caucus, she knew she 
wanted in too.

DESIGN BY NOAH FINER

ALEC COHEN/Daily
Journalist Anu Partanen speaks on her book “The Nordic Theory of Everything: In Search of a Better Life,” during an Honors Stowe lecture in the Rackham amphitheater Monday. 


“Six months in jail, this officer 
asked me a question that seemed 
basic,” Salaam said. “He said 
‘Hey there, who are you? ‘I’ve 
been watching you. You are not 
supposed to be here. Who are 
you?’”
LSA 
freshman 
Temilolu 
Yusuf 
told 
The 
Daily 
she 
enjoyed hearing Salaam talk 
about the role of religion in his 
journey through prison. 
“I love the fact that he 
really 
incorporated 
religion 
and the role of religion in his 
incarceration process as well 
as his exoneration,” Yusuf said. 
“He really shows that for some 
things in life, that you really 
need that belief and support 
system… Even in prison, where 
many people use religion as 
a way to bring themselves up 
and not feel like prisoners, 
feel like they have control over 
themselves. It was amazing to 
see that he’s telling us, as people 
who have never been in prison, 
that religion is something that 
you shouldn’t only have when 
your back is against the wall. 

You should have it all the time.”

During his speech, Salaam 
also discussed how, in the 
1980s, President Donald Trump, 
a prominent business 
figure in New York 
at the time, wanted 
the five teenagers 
to be sentenced to 
the 
death 
penalty 
only 
two 
weeks 
after 
their 
arrest. 
Salaam discussed the 
horrific 
statements 
Trump made about 
them and his reaction 
when 
Trump 
became 
president. 
Salaam 
spoke 
about Trump while 
holding up a copy 
of an advertisement 
Trump paid for in 
the New York Times.
“In 
a 
country 
where 
you 
think 
you are innocent until proven 
guilty,” Salaam said. “In a 
country where Dr. King said 
we 
live 
in 
two 
Americas: 
divided and unequal … Then 
you turn on the news and you 
realize, this can’t be right. You 

mean the man who called for 
our death. The man who was 
the fire starter. The man who 
writes in the papers that we 
should just take the eldest one 

and hang him from a tree in 
Central Park … That he will 
become the President of the 
United States. I wondered what 
God was doing.”

Public 
Health 
sophomore 

Aysiah White told The Daily 
she appreciated Salaam talk 
about his personal experience 
and how it has impacted his 
life’s work. 

“My favorite part about the 
event was Dr. Salaam being 
vulnerable and sharing his 
voice,” White said. “It takes 
a lot for a person to stand in 
front of a whole crowd and to 
tell their story, especially one 

as personal as his. So I was just 
very appreciative that he took 
time to actually tell his part of 
his story.”
A 
panel 
following 
the 
keynote 
speech 
featured five panelists 
who contributed to the 
Black History Month 
narrative. Su’ad Abdul 
Khabeer, 
associate 
professor of American 
Culture, 
moderated 
the 
discussion 
and 
asked 
the 
panelists 
questions about hope, 
abolitionism 
and 
the 
impact of incarceration 
on families. 
A 
student 
asked 
the 
panel 
about 
unconscious racial bias 
and how to interact 
with 
people 
who 
present those attitudes 
towards 
people 
of 
color. In response, Erin 
Keith, staff attorney for the 
Detroit Justice Center, said 
unconscious bias is a reaction 
to Black people being able to 
thrive through centuries of 
injustice.
“Black people are in the 

future,” Keith said. “(People 
with unconscious bias) are 
afraid 
because 
they 
are 
wondering how we are still 
here, how are we still standing. 
No matter what anyone says, we 
are still gonna be in the future.”
LSA senior Nando Felten said 
he appreciated the multiple 
perspectives on the panel and 
the empowerment of Black 
people as the future of America. 
Felten 
said 
hearing 
Public 
Policy junior Cydney Garner 
Brown 
and 
Cozine 
Welch 
of the Prison Creative Arts 
Project speak on the panel was 
especially moving.
“My favorite part was just 
seeing the panel, seeing Cydney 
Garner Brown on stage with 
people 
that 
have 
served,” 
Felton said. “Cozine served 
20 years in prison and that’s 
pretty much as long as (I’ve) 
been alive and seeing how he’s 
still here. He’s a director of 
different 
organizations 
and 
seeing the impact that these 
people are making on the world 
is amazing. The final ending 
part of how they said that Black 
people are in the future was 
just amazing and touching.”

“They specify the process by 
which faculty can be fired or lose 
tenure and receive one year of 
compensation, 
severance, 
after 
termination,” Glotzer said. “These 
bylaws were instituted back in the 
McCarthy era to ensure strong 
protections for academic freedom 
and they were mostly unchanged 
since they were written back in the 
‘50s.”
Glotzer also elaborated on the 
current system instituted by these 
bylaws, saying that there is a two-
tiered process in place that can be 
very complex and time-consuming. 
In this process, two separate trials 
run alongside one another in 
cases of charged tenured faculty 
members. 
“Our current bylaws also say that 
faculty receive full compensation 
until the 5.09 process concludes 
with termination, regardless of 
the aggressiveness of the alleged 
misconduct,” 
Glotzer 
said. 
“And in most cases terminated 
faculty members receive a year of 
severance pay. The issue is that 

our current 5.09 process has been 
applied to the type of egregious 
misconduct that was never meant 
to be afforded the protections of 
tenure in the first place.”
The faculty working group 
received input and feedback from 
faculty members, lawyers and 
administrators that had experience 
with 5.09 cases.
The first proposed change is to 
eliminate the two-tiered process 
and create one pathway with a 
clear timeline that uses deadlines to 
initiate review processes efficiently. 
Glotzer said individual hearing 
committees are selected from a 
standing committee of members, 
and she asked for feedback on the 
two-tiered process.
“One of the ideas that we’re 
considering is to establish a 
standing 
Judicial 
Committee 
under SACUA that would be like a 
tenure and promotion committee,” 
Glotzer said. “It would be a 
standing committee from which 
members of the hearing committee 
could be chosen.”
Glotzer also said bylaw 5.10, 
which 
dictates 
severance 
pay 
policy, does not exclude exceptions 
for harassment cases and other 

“non-crimes” 
that 
go 
against 
University policy. She said she was 
open to feedback on whether to 
adopt or eliminate it. 
“Our 
current 
bylaw 
5.10 
allows for one-year severance 
pay 
after 
termination, 
except 
when prohibited by law based on 
the character or conduct of the 
faculty member, when the faculty 
member is convicted of a felony or 
serious misdemeanor that involves 
students or the university or 
when there is intentional refusal 
to 
perform 
properly 
assigned 
academic duties,” Glotzer said. 
The committee then opened the 
floor for questions from the town 
hall audience and feedback on their 
proposed changes to the bylaws.
Astronomy professor Sally Oey 
said she would support SACUA 
accepting responsibility for review 
committee appointments.
“I would just ask that SACUA 
be the entity that does the actual 
appointment of the committee 
and that we just specify that that’s 
it,” Oey said. “That the bylaw 
itself specifies that SACUA be the 
responsible party, and that way if 
the judicial panel doesn’t work and 
if there are unforeseen things that 

may be awkward or logistically 
problematic, those things can be 
tweaked, but the bylaw itself be 
something simple and high level.”
Astronomy professor Michael 
Meyer 
said 
he 
supported 
eliminating pay suspension before 
a review process is carried out.
“I understand that there was 
a consensus to get rid of the 
suspension of pay before due 
processes unfolded and I support 
that, but in this case I don’t 
think there would be severance, 
typically for other employees at 
the University who are terminated 
for cause,” Meyer said. “I think if 
the process is good and it’s gone 
through thoroughly, someone has 
been fired and they no longer have 
tenure.” 
Jerry 
Sanders, 
associate 
professor of biology at U-M 
Flint, expressed concern at the 
ambiguous nature of the current 
bylaws. 
“One thing that I’m concerned 
about the severance pay suspension 
and the phrase ‘other non-crimes’, 
when you’re being very very vague 
about things, that opens up a whole 
can of worms,” Sanders said. 

“I’m like, guess I’m skipping 
class on Monday,” Kosticak said. 
She drove nine hours to Des 
Moines by herself, in her self-
proclaimed “clown car” — a 
hybrid with great gas mileage. 
Kosticak wasn’t nervous for 
the long drive, she said, but her 
parents were. 
“I almost didn’t tell them, 
but then I’m like, I feel like they 
would want to know something 
like this,” Kosticak said. “Like, 
‘oh, I’m just going to go to Iowa 
for four days!’” 
Once there, Kosticak said 
her job was to knock on doors 
and do whatever the campaign 
needed at the moment. 
“That weekend before, I’m 
told, is crucial for reaching 
out to folks,” she said. “So just 
showing that we care about 
having people’s voices heard no 
matter where they come from or 
what their political beliefs are.” 
LSA sophomore Alexander 
Zittleman, a member of the 
University’s chapter of Students 
for Bernie, travelled to Clinton, 
Iowa, to canvass for Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, D-Vt., with Spartans 

for Sanders, a student group 
from Michigan State University. 
“I decided to go to Iowa for 
the chance to get out of my 
comfort zone and talk to people 
about the issues that matter and 
to encourage people to vote,” 
Zittleman told The Daily in an 
email interview. “Being the first 
caucus, Iowa sets the tone for 
the rest of the primary season 
and Iowa has the potential to 
build even more momentum for 
Bernie.” 
“It was just fun getting 
involved because it was the 
first time for most of us.”
Seven members of the Ann 
Arbor Yang Gang also traveled 
to Davenport to canvass for 
Andrew 
Yang, 
entrepreneur 
and 
Democratic 
presidential 
candidate. This wasn’t their 
first trip for the candidate — 
members of the group went to 
Westerville, Ohio, to support 
Yang 
during 
the 
fourth 
Democratic debate this past 
October. 
“That trip was a lot of fun,” 
Engineering 
senior 
Justin 
Zhao, event coordinator for the 
group, said. “People were super 
receptive to our candidate. It 
was just fun getting involved 
because it was the first time for 

most of us.” 
When 
they 
had 
the 
opportunity to travel for Yang 
again, they jumped at the 
chance. 
“Andrew is still kind of a 
fringe candidate, I would say,” 
Zhao told The Daily. “So he 
needs to perform well in the 
early states for his campaign … 
to succeed.” 
Zhao said they may look into 
planning a canvassing trip to 
New Hampshire, the next state 
to hold a primary, as well. South 
Carolina, another early state, is 
“too far of a drive.” 
The group has been working 
to drum up support for Yang 
on campus through tabling 
in Mason Hall and postering 
around Ann Arbor, but Zhao 
said they’re putting most of 
their energy into making sure 
Yang can stay in the race long 
enough to get to the Michigan 
primary. 
“We’re probably going to be 
most energized if he’s doing well 
in the early states. If he’s doing 
well in the early states and he 
has a viable chance to win then 
we’re going to do more work for 
sure,” he said. 
“Even if we’re not in Iowa, 
we’re still going to make our 

presence felt.”
Some students who couldn’t 
physically be in Iowa this 
weekend still chose to help out 
their chosen candidates from 
afar. Kosticak said her fellow 
Students for Pete members who 
couldn’t travel this weekend 
were planning a phone banking 
event to reach Iowa voters 
remotely. 
Similarly, 
LSA 
freshman 
Andrew Schaeffler, co-founder 
of the University’s Students for 
Biden chapter, had hoped to 
organize a trip to Iowa for some 
Students for Biden members. 
They weren’t able to coordinate 
a ride, but Schaeffler said they 
planned to make calls to Iowa 
residents in support of the 
former vice president. 
Students for Biden has held 
regular phone banks for the 
campaign this fall — “every 
weekend 
or 
every 
other 
weekend,” Schaeffler said. They 
used the campaign’s website to 
call into Iowa and talk to caucus 
voters about why they support 
Biden and to make sure voters 
have information about their 
caucus locations. 
Schaeffler said the group has 
placed an emphasis on phone 
banking into Iowa because it’s 

a crucial point in the campaign. 
“I was definitely more so 
expecting to do things that 
were on a more local basis,” he 
said. “But we’ve put such an 
emphasis on our phone banking 
calling into Iowa because we 
know … that’s a priority that we 
want to commit to. And then 
once Iowa passes, we’ll be much 
more focused on Michigan.” 
Schaeffler was also asked to 
serve as a precinct captain, a 
person who serves as a liaison 
between a political party and 
voters, for Biden at the first-ever 
satellite caucus in Ann Arbor on 
Monday. The caucus is one of 99 
events that will allow registered 
Iowa Democrats who can’t be at 
their allocated caucus location 
to cast their vote on Monday. 
“Even if we’re not in Iowa, 
we’re still going to make our 
presence felt in Iowa, and do 
everything we can to reach out,” 
he said. 
Back in Davenport
After 
receiving 
their 
instructions, the Students for 
Warren group left canvassing 
HQ and drove to a quiet 
Davenport street a few miles 
away. 
Chamra and Kumar walked 
up the driveway and through the 

fence of the first house on their 
canvassing list. Kumar knocked 
on the door, and they waited a 
moment until a man opened the 
door a crack, his young daughter 
peeking out next to him. 
“Hi, my name’s Ashvin, I’m 
a 
volunteer 
with 
Elizabeth 
Warren’s campaign, and this is 
Maya,” Kumar said, following 
the script on his clipboard. 
They talked to the man for a 
moment, but he said he already 
supported Warren and already 
knew his caucus day plan, so 
Chamra and Kumar thanked 
him and said goodbye. 
As they walked back down 
the driveway, Chamra said she 
thought it had gone pretty well. 
“A lot of people kind of don’t 
like to be disturbed at their 
house,” she said. “But he opened 
the door and said he supported 
Warren and that he has a caucus 
plan, so that’s good!” 
The 
pair 
huddled 
over 
Kumar’s phone, trying to figure 
out where to go next. With a 
direction decided, they started 
off down the street, feeling 
warmed up and ready for a day 
of knocking on doors.

“We don’t just have therapy,” 
Saniyah said. “We have yoga, 
massage, energy work because 
we do believe that healing is an 
integrative journey.”
Saniyah 
exemplified 
the 
necessity of diverse healing 
approaches 
by 
leading 
the 
audience in a brief two-minute 
breathing exercise. She said 
with meditation, attendees have 
the opportunity to connect with 
their surroundings and with 
their breathing.
The event progressed to a 
larger discussion of identity 
and healing. Saniyah said when 
she was first invited to speak, 
she was unsure what she would 
share with the audience. What 
was most important to her 
was the idea of freedom and 
liberation in the world today, 
especially as someone who has 
been marginalized by society. 
“What does it mean to truly 
be free? How much agency do 
I have over what that looks 
like in my life?” Saniyah asked. 
“We can talk about freedom 
from structures and systems 
that seek to control us, or 
maybe it’s freedom from stories 
or narratives that have been 
projected onto us.”
In 
addressing 
these 
questions, Saniyah related back 
to the practice and importance 
of health in wellness in our 
communities. 
Therapy, 
as 
Saniyah 
described, 
provides 
the 
opportunity 
to 
share 
experiences and heal. Moreover, 
Saniyah said she focuses on the 
idea of resistance instead of 
resilience. 
“In 
my 
view, 
resilience 
highlights 
the 
ability 
for 
marginalized folks to be strong 
and overcome,” Saniyah said. 
“It’s our responsibility to be 
strong and resilient rather than 
the system’s responsibility to 
change? For me, I’m driven 

by the idea of resistance, not 
resilience. Through my actions, 
I want to inspire others to resist 
the narratives and systems that 
try to suffocate us and make us 
feel small.” 
The event then opened up to a 
Q&A segment. Neal Elkin, alum 
of the University of Michigan’s 
Medical School, asked the first 
question. He spoke about his 
experience marching in the 1973 
gay pride parade in Ann Arbor. 
His question concerned the 
current political climate in the 
country. 
“I’m really worried about 
where our country is going right 
now, all of the benefits we’ve 
been able to achieve are under 
threat,” Elkin said. “I’m just 
wondering what you personally 
think about political activism 
and the role it will play in 
preserving where we’re at right 
now and making progress in the 
future.”
 
Saniyah 
responded 
by 
addressing how activism can 
create 
change. 
According 
to 
Saniyah, 
both 
activism 
and therapy have an equally 
significant 
role 
to 
play 
in 
making marginalized groups 
and individuals feel heard. 
“Political activism can be 
really helpful and empowering 
for folks and can effect change,” 
Saniyah said. “My hope and 
my dream is that we don’t have 
to change who we are. That’s 
why voting matters, supporting 
candidates who share our values 
matter and having conversations 
with people who don’t always 
share our views matter.” 
LSA freshman Lydia Stevens 
said 
a 
quote 
mentioned 
by 
feminist 
writer 
Audre 
Lorde 
about 
how 
self-care 
is a revolutionary act really 
resonated with her. 
“I really liked the quote from 
Audre Lorde,” Stevens said. 
“The best resistance is self-
care and thriving. That’s really 
important to keep in mind, 
especially in today’s climate.”

TOWN HALL
From Page 1

In 
the 
first 
round 
of 
preferences, 
five 
Iowans 
supported 
Warren, 
three 
voters supported Sanders and 
one supported Buttigieg. 
Due to Iowa Democratic 
Party rules, Buttigieg and 
the other candidates who 
received less than 15 percent 
of the initial vote were deemed 
“non-viable” for the caucus 
in Ann Arbor. The Warren 
and Sanders supporters had 
a fifteen-minute period to 
try to convince the lone 
Buttigieg 
supporter, 
Law 
School 
student 
Michael 
Goodyear, to join their group. 
This realignment period took 
up the majority of the time 

in the caucus, and Goodyear 
was resistant to odes from the 
Sanders and Warren groups. 
“I’m a fan of Buttigieg’s 
moderate policies,” Goodyear 
said. “I went through all 
the 
platforms 
online 
and 
Buttigieg’s are all extremely 
well thought out. As a law 
student, I like that there are 
footnotes that have actual 
sources for everything and 
credible depth to a lot of 
policies.”
Goodyear 
ultimately 
decided 
to 
abstain 
from 
voting rather than join the 
Sanders or Warren groups 
after the realignment period. 
“It felt odd, like my vote 
wasn’t counting,” Goodyear 
said. “Caucuses are a very 
different 
experience 
but 
certainly 
not 
the 
most 
democratic. It was great for 

the 19th century but not so 
great for the 21st.”
Before the caucus, LSA 
freshman Andrew Schaeffler 
told The Daily that close to 
half of the satellite caucus 
locations are in college towns 
like Ann Arbor. 
“It’s really cool for college 
students who are registered 
Iowa Democrats to have their 
voices 
heard,” 
Schaeffler 
said. “It’s a phenomenal job 
by the Iowa Democratic Party 
to put the focus on students 
… since it’s not a primary 
system in which they can just 
cast an absentee ballot.”
After the caucus, Iowan 
Joanna Courteau reflected 
on the differences between 
the traditional Iowa caucuses 
she’s attended since 1976 and 
the new satellite caucus. 
“The 
participants 
in 

a 
regular 
caucus 
totally 
outnumber 
observers 
and 
media people,” Courteau said. 
“They’re really involved and 
there’s a lot of haggling going 
on and a lot of persuading the 
non-aligned people. People 
today were so polite with the 
Pete Buttigieg guy.”
Every 
Iowan 
caucusing 
Monday 
night, 
beside 
Courteau, were University 
students. 
Courteau, 
who 
splits 
time 
between 
Ann 
Arbor and Aimes, Iowa, was 
grateful for the large student 
presence. 
“I am trying as hard as 
I can to pass the torch to 
the 
younger 
generation,” 
Courteau said. “Seeing them 
be 
involved, 
them 
being 
interested is really important 
to me.”

 Compostable cup meets reality

T

here is a great deal of 
hypocrisy in throwing a 
compostable cup into the 
garbage. Despite being labeled 
as 
environmentally 
friendly, 
these products are often sent to 
the landfill anyway. In Crisler 
Center, many concessions are 
sold 
in 
compostable 
ware, 
often accompanied by a utensil 
in 
an 
eco-friendly 
wrapper. 
However, there is not a single 
compost bin in Crisler Center. 
A 
common 
misconception 
is 
that 
compostable 
items 
can 
biodegrade 
in 
landfills, 
but 
compostable 
materials 
must be placed in the correct 
environment to actually break 
down. So, what happens when 
these compostable materials end 
up in the landfill?
Without the oxygen provided 
by a proper composting cycle, 
items in a landfill will either 
cease to break down at all or 
break down anaerobically. In one 
study published by the American 
Chemical Society, the Polylactic 
acid (PLA) — or cornstarch, 
which is what most compostable 
materials are made from — 
released methane via anaerobic 
decomposition. Another study 
published 
by 
the 
analytics 
company 
Elsevier, 
however, 
concluded the PLA did not break 
down at all. At the bare minimum, 
while these items may not release 
methane, they are still effectively 
relegated to being normal trash. 
Regardless 
of 
whether 
the 
compostable material releases 
methane, one thing is for certain: 
It is not becoming compost.
When 
compostable 
items 
do end up in the compost, 
it is a completely different 
story. At a composting facility, 
care is taken in the aeration 
of organic materials so they 
properly decompose. Through a 
specialized process, composting 
creates a useful product for 
agriculture and gardening while 
diverting waste from the landfill.
Composting 
has 
exploded 
in visibility with the rise of 
certified compostable disposable 

foodware 
and 
bags. 
The 
Biodegradable Products Institute 
(BPI), the lead certifier in North 
America, was founded in 1990 
and today has certified over 
10,000 products. It is common 
to see the green BPI logo on the 
disposable cups or bags sold 
by Ann Arbor vendors and at 
University of Michigan events. 
Another 
concern 
for 
compostable products is the 
inclusion of a non-compostable 
sticker on the product, which 
prevents 
them 
from 
being 
composted. 
Plastic 
stickers 
contaminate 
the 
compost, 
resulting in a whole load of 
organic materials being rejected 
by 
the 
composting 
facility. 
Perhaps 
the 
company 
did 
not truly intend for the item 
to be composted if it was so 
carelessly converted into a non-
compostable item. The desire 
for personalized branding can 
be accommodated while staying 
true to the product’s goal, which 
is easily done as compostable 
ware 
companies 
do 
offer 
customization. 
In sustainability efforts, the 
responsibility 
is 
frequently 
placed on the individual to seek 
out 
environmentally-conscious 
actions. While education and 
awareness are crucial to a 
functioning composting system, 
there is a big problem with 
companies that set consumers 
up 
for 
failure. 
Compostable 
materials 
are 
too 
often 
introduced without even giving 
the consumer the option to 
dispose of them properly. 
If a company’s management 
genuinely 
intends to 
reduce 
waste, 
they 
need 
to 
think 
about where their compostable 
items will end up. When a 
restaurant offers compostable 
products without the intent 
for them to be composted, they 
are greenwashing themselves 
— 
changing 
appearances 
to 
look environmentally friendly 
without making any true impact. 
Companies 
that 
are 
purchasing compostable ware are 

still helping the environmental 
cause in some way because 
they are giving their money to a 
green industry. While financially 
supporting 
a 
sustainability-
focused industry is certainly 
useful, 
not 
offering 
their 
products with the appropriate 
care is taking away from the 
accomplishments 
of 
other 
companies that are. An example 
is Hopcat, a Michigan restaurant 
and bar chain that walks the 
walk with a robust composting 
system. They communicate with 
local composting providers and 
train employees on composting. 
This successful system is far 
more proactive than just offering 
compostable products, although 
the average consumer may not be 
able to tell.
Food-service businesses should 
not give out compostable ware 
until they are prepared to offer 
consumers a way to compost them. 
It is irresponsible to make people 
throw their compostable cups 
into garbage bins as if there has 
still been some environmental 
success. Until the business is 
ready to offer a compost bin, they 
can instead provide disposables 
that are made of post-consumer 
products or other sustainably 
sourced materials.
I commend businesses that 
make an effort to be more 
sustainable even when not done 
to completion. The thought is 
there, although the execution 
is 
ineffective 
and 
perhaps 
misleading the public. Places 
like 
Crisler 
Center 
should 
be held to a higher standard. 
The University certainly has 
the 
knowledge 
and 
ability 
to offer composting in the 
locations where compostable 
ware is available. If you find 
yourself holding a cup with a 
compostable logo on it, don’t 
pat yourself on the back just yet. 
It may not be plastic, but it’s as 
good as trash if you don’t put it 
in the right place.

The dangers of group identity politics on college campuses
I 

recently read a piece by 
essayist 
Phillip 
Lopate 
titled “On the Necessity 
of Turning Oneself into a 
Character.” It offers advice 
to 
writers 
about 
building 
themselves 
into 
characters 
— rounding out the “I” in 
the 
narration 
of 
personal 
narratives and creative non-
fiction. One passage stood out 
for reasons entirely unrelated to 
the craft of writing: “Ethnicity, 
gender, 
religion, 
class, 
geography, politics: These are 
all 
strong 
determinants 
in 
the development of character. 
Sometimes they can be made 
too much of, as in the worst 
sort of ‘identity politics,’ which 
seeks to explain away all the 
intangibles of a human being’s 
destiny by this or that social 
oppression.” 
Lopate 
suggests 
that 
an 
element of building characters 
in 
stories 
is 
explicitly 
recognizing 
the 
groups 
to 
which we belong, because to 
some 
extent, 
these 
groups 
have shaped us. They are not 
meaningless 
associations. 
They’re 
worth 
bringing 
to 
the forefront when we define 
ourselves. But Lopate makes 
the 
poignant 
observation 
that, 
beyond 
what 
applies 
to 
essay-writing 
and 
self-
questioning, “identity politics” 
reduce the individual to these 
group associations — known 
quantities — and neuters the 
qualities that make one an 
individual.
Lopate’s 
point, 
while 
tangential, applies to university 
climates. 
At 
universities, 
political 
correctness 
is 
a 
subtle but dominating force; 
it’s a feature of many college 
campuses around the nation. 
Essayist John Taylor describes 
it as a “New Fundamentalism” 
in 
a 
New 
York 
Magazine 
cover story: The radical left 
students who live by politically 
correct dogma take on extreme 
measures to make sure other 
students do the same. This 
purportedly 
advances 
the 
interests of oppressed groups. 
Why? Because the zeitgeist 
of 
universities, 
specifically 
the humanities and even the 
sciences, are informed by belief 
systems that favor wealthy, 
powerful 
and 
privileged 
groups. Political correctness 
(PC) 
culture, 
therefore, 
corrects 
this 
inherent 
imbalance by purging out of 
the public sphere ideas that 
are considered the status quo. 
As reasoned as it might be to 
simply believe a societal power 
structure exists that prevents 
equal opportunity, the most 
extreme PC activists go to 
embarrassing and even violent 
ends to act on their strongly 
held beliefs.
Political 
correctness 
is, 
therefore, 
an 
ideological 
engine that promotes group 
identity politics on college 

campuses. This is dangerous 
for several reasons. It co-opts 
meaningful 
indicators 
of 
identity, 
like 
background, 
ethnicity and politics, for use 
in assigning value to each other 
and each other’s opinions. This 
creates an atmosphere where 
opinions are judged not on 
the merits of their idea, but 
on how supposedly oppressed 
the individual holding that 
opinion is. Moreover, certain 
opinions 
can 
be 
deemed 
invalid (by the left) for reasons 
that are wholly beyond your 
control. This harms campus 
discourse because it enables 
people 
to 
presume 
your 
opinions based on your group 
identities. You may not agree 
with any of the beliefs you’re 
linked with but are judged for 
them nonetheless. Moreover, 
it encourages a silencing of 
viewpoints that are misaligned 
with 
(read: 
right-leaning) 
prevailing campus ideas, so 
only certain groups are worth 
listening to.

This emphasis on group 
identities 
politics 
makes 
political correctness harmful 
to free speech as well. Open 
discourse is necessarily linked 
to the sharing of ideas; it is 
tied to an environment in 
which ideas can be heard. PC 
culture inhibits the formation 
of 
such 
an 
environment 
because it labels people and 
their ideas with unrelated 
superlatives 
like 
“racist,” 
“sexist” and “patriarchal” for 
mostly arbitrary reasons. What 
might have begun as a parsing 
tool 
for 
identifying 
ideas 
with malintent has become 
a mechanism for silencing 
people who don’t agree with 
PC culture.
These viewpoints are not 
“racist” or “sexist”; they’re just 
labeled as such, due to some 
unclear association with these 
labels, for the purposes of 
silencing a competing opinion. 
As such, the politically-correct 
left has free reign to stymie 
campus 
discussions 
and 
debates that involve ideas they 
don’t like. This fundamentally 
defeats 
the 
purpose 
of 
universities, 
as 
Robert 
Zimmer, 
president 
of 
the 
University of Chicago, recently 
noted in a speech in Vienna: 
“Students should be learning 
from each other by working 
through 
and 
discussing 
different opinions ... But the 

environment of demonization 
and ostracism of those with 
opposing views can choke the 
intra-student discourse vital to 
an education.”
This 
type 
of 
closed-
mindedness, this unwillingness 
to listen to other opinions, 
is antithetical to the mission 
of 
a 
university. 
And 
more 
specifically, the intent to shut 
down other opinions due to 
their disagreement with far-
left culture inhibits free and 
open 
speech. 
Free 
speech, 
however, 
is 
a 
necessary 
element 
of 
universities 
as 
it 
fosters 
an 
intellectually 
rigorous environment where 
voices and ideas can be heard 
and 
scrutinized 
properly. 
Radical promoters of political 
correctness prevent this ideal 
culture from existing because 
people are unjustly demeaned 
for their divergent beliefs.
Indeed, this is a problem even 
on the University of Michigan 
campus. Only two years ago, 
protests nearly derailed an 
American Enterprise Institute-
sponsored 
event 
hosting 
controversial political scientist 
Charles Murray. Chants and 
disruptions reigned during the 
entirety of a peaceful event 
about the politics underpinning 
the 2016 election. PC culture is 
a problem among faculty, too. 
This past year, a non-profit free 
speech advocacy group Speech 
First filed a lawsuit against 
the University on behalf of 
students who were identified 
by the U-M Bias Response 
Team (BRT). The team was 
designed to reprimand students 
for offensive speech, but how 
they carried out this intention 
was called into question by 
the students and Speech First, 
resulting in a victory for the 
conservative 
activists 
and 
disbanding of the BRT.
The phenomenon of political 
correctness 
on 
campuses 
is 
dangerous. 
It 
prevents 
the understanding that our 
identities are most definitely 
informed by our backgrounds, 
politics and unique ways of 
thinking: This surely applies 
to writing, but is more true 
for individuals in real life. 
It reduces the individual to 
group identities; it reduces 
divergent ideas to their group 
associations. This brand of 
identity 
politics 
devalues 
diversity of viewpoint and 
imposes 
a 
danger 
to 
free 
discourse on campus because 
individual 
and 
divergent 
opinions 
are 
considered 
fundamentally 
invalid 
due 
to their departure from the 
accepted norm. This culture 
can only be corrected with a 
robust commitment to free 
and independent thinking, for 
which a university atmosphere 
is perfect.

How to really address climate change

I

n 
the 
last 
few 
years, 
whether it be on our 
campus 
or 
halfway 
across the world, our anxiety 
around climate change has 
hit 
an 
unprecedented 
level 
— dominating conversations, 
protests 
and 
activism 
on 
practically every continent.
Here in Ann Arbor, University 
of Michigan students and the 
greater 
Washtenaw 
County 
community have made their 
voices heard that they want real 
action on the climate crisis. In 
September 2019, thousands of 
community 
members 
joined 
the 
large-scale 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate 
Strike 
and 
demanded immediate change. 
Beyond this, student activists 
have overwhelmingly pushed 
back against the University’s 
commitment 
to 
investing 
in fossil fuels, climaxing in 
the arrest of 10 protesters 
by campus police in March. 
Many of my colleagues at The 
Michigan Daily have clearly 
echoed these opinions, stressing 
how important it is that society 
adopts aggressive plans like 
the Green New Deal without 
hesitation. 
However, travel a few miles 
outside Ann Arbor city limits 
and you’ll get a completely 
different picture of Washtenaw 
County’s position on climate 
change. According to county 
election records, while the Ann 
Arbor and Ypsilanti areas — 
predominantly urban centers — 
have unsurprisingly supported 
the Democratic agenda, the 
same isn’t true in other parts 
of the county. In fact, in the 
November 2016 election, many 
of the Washtenaw townships 
unequivocally 
affirmed 
their 
support for President Donald 
Trump, who has done little to 
fight the climate crisis, calling it 
a Chinese hoax. Election results 
show that a high number of 
precincts supported Trump by 
over 50 percent, while some 
areas voted for him by almost 65 
percent. Therefore, while many 
of the opinions expressed here on 
our campus are valid, they clearly 
don’t represent the perspectives 
of many Washtenaw residents 
or the areas surrounding our 
university.

This means something not 
only for Washtenaw County — 
but for the entire climate fight. 
The same trend is occurring 
across the entire country, as 
well as on the international 
stage. The problem is that 
climate change has for years 
remained an issue on the left. 
Many people in Ann Arbor think 
we need to support legislation 
like the Green New Deal and 
throw away all fossil fuels, but 
you’ll hear exactly the opposite 
from people living a short drive 
away. All across the country 
and perhaps the world, liberals 
talk a lot about climate change 
while 
conservatives 
remain 
relatively silent. The crisis has 
gained significant attention — 
there’s no doubt about that — 
but this recognition is unevenly 
distributed across society. 
I support many Republican 
positions on issues, but I fear 
the inherent dangers of climate 
change. Many people might 
expect me to reject climate 
change entirely because of my 
political views, but that’s not 
true. It’s not a Chinese hoax, 
but a real disaster that needs 
a real solution. Sooner rather 
than later, our society will have 
to confront the effects of global 
warming and rising sea levels.
However, 
I, 
along 
with 
many other more conservative 
and 
moderate 
citizens, 
am 
unable to engage in the climate 
conversation because it has 
become far too extreme. (I 
would 
even 
suggest 
that 
Trump’s 
ability 
to 
address 
the crisis is impaired by this 
phenomenon that so many have 
experienced.) It is easy to feel 
alienated and excluded in this 
divisive conversation, one where 
few 
alternative 
viewpoints 
are readily welcomed. Real 
change could occur, if only the 
leaders 
of 
the 
conversation 
could become leaders for all 
and invite everybody to work 
toward a solution. A movement 
cannot ignore the views of half 
of the constituency; it has to 
learn to adapt, encompassing 
what everybody believes if true 
progress is to occur.
There have been numerous 
legislative attempts in the past 
to mitigate climate change and 

global warming on a smaller 
scale, but few, if any, have made 
notable advancements for the 
cause. More recently, some 
members of Congress, including 
Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have 
even advocated for alternatives 
to the Green New Deal, like 
the “Green Real Deal.” The 
Green Real Deal “recognizes 
that a national commitment 
to 
innovation, 
competitive 
markets, and the deployment of 
advanced energy technologies 
will help the United States as the 
global leader in clean energy,” 
according to the Gaetz’s official 
website. 
While 
Democrats 
predictably didn’t express much 
approval for the proposal, these 
types of bills — which are far 
more practical and politically 
feasible — are precisely the kind 
we need to pass if we want to 
save our planet. 
The truth is that proposals 
like the Green New Deal, along 
with a cascade of other extreme 
climate legislation, are simply 
not capable of solving this 
crisis because they’re far too 
dramatic.
We shouldn’t be talking 
about 
complex 
measures 
that completely change our 
way of life, something that 
makes 
these 
proposals 
so 
unattractive in the first place. 
We need to find ways to draft 
legislation that respects the 
needs of ordinary, hard-working 
Americans, our current way of 
life and the economy. We need to 
take small but significant steps 
that can gradually move our 
planet toward the ideal state 
that so many climate advocates 
envision. 
The 
progress 
we 
will 
experience by acting in this 
manner may not be exactly 
what current activists are 
hoping for, but it will surely be 
a significant leap from what’s 
being 
accomplished 
now. 
Ultimately, until society can 
effectively part ways with the 
divisive, unrealistic solutions 
that have become so common 
in the climate conversation, 
real improvement will be 
near impossible to reach.

When listening to her song “Christmas Lights,” 
you might think Ingrid Michaelson is describing the 
sadness of missing a loved one during the holidays; 
however, she’s actually narrating the thoughts of 
Joyce Byers, the mother of a missing boy in another 
dimension from the Netflix series “Stranger 
Things.” “You’re not here, but you’re here / I can 
still hear you call / Like a faraway bird trapped 
inside of the wall” Michaelson croons, recounting 
the scenes when Byers is able to communicate with 
her son via the Christmas lights hanging around 
her house.
While she’s built her career on her honesty and 
vulnerability, Michaelson took a new approach 
on her latest album Stranger Songs, dedicating 
the entirety of the album to the characters of 
“Stranger Things.” I had the opportunity to talk 
with Michaelson on Wednesday before watching 
her perform live at Folk Festival to discuss her new 
album and her upcoming show.
“Basically all the songs on the record are from 
the point of view of a few of the characters,” 
Michaelson said. “It’s essentially an assignment. 
There’s this song, you have to tell this story. For me, 
the structure of it is really different and just getting 
into a groove of writing about what you’re thinking 
or writing what you’re feeling or writing about 
what you went through, it sort of feels like you have 
homework.
But within that structure I find great comfort for 
whatever reason, maybe because I’ve never really 
written like that before. It allows me to somehow 
be more creative because I have this structure, if 
that makes any sense. I’ve been really loving it and 
enjoying it. Applying it to pop writing has just been 
really cool and fun and rewarding.”
In her bio for Stranger Songs, Michaelson 
describes how she felt as though she was writing too 
much from the “brain and mind and soul of Ingrid 
Michaelson,” so Stranger Songs was a way for her to 

plug her own experiences into a pre-existing story.
“Even though you’re taking inspiration from 
something else, there are still songs on the record 
that are very personal to me because the ideas 
are universal,” Michaelson said. “We all suffer 
heartbreak, we all suffer loss, we all have love in 
our life in some capacity, so even though they are 
pre-existing stories, my own voice is definitely 
there. My own vulnerability and my own part are 
definitely in the songs in Stranger Songs.”
The album pairs well with her other big project 
as the composer for the musical adaptation of “The 
Notebook.”
“In a musical you’re writing music that’s from 
the point of view of other characters of another 
story, so you get to tell a story through songs, which 
is really amazing,” Michaelson noted. “And then 
that’s where, although I didn’t realize this until 
after the fact, Stranger Songs came from because 
I was doing a very similar thing only in the realm 
of pop music where I’m taking pre-existing stories 
and characters and I’m funneling them through my 
lense.”
As a teaser to the opening of “The Notebook,” 
Michaelson performed an unreleased song from 
the show at the festival and encouraged audience 
members to see it live at the Chicago Shakespeare 
Theater in September.
Michaelson was one of six acts performing at the 
first night of the 43rd Annual Folk Festival, a two-
day event that raises money for The Ark, a local non-
profit concert venue in Ann Arbor. Sporting black 
jeans and a t-shirt, Michaelson walked on stage 
with her long-time bandmate Allie Moss.
“It’s going to be very acoustic, just how I started 
touring years ago,” Michaelson said before the 
show. “It was just Allie and me in a minivan. So 
we’re going to do everything acoustic, stripped 
down. She’s one of my favorite people to sing with. 
Harmonizing with her is [great]. She’s so amazingly 
good and she blends so well.”

Daily Arts Writer

The second night of The Ark’s 43rd Ann Arbor Folk 
Festival began with the lilting sounds of guitar, banjo 
and lap steel, as it often does. There is nothing quite 
like sitting in Hill Auditorium during the festival, 
every seat filled with excited patrons laughing, crying 
and clapping throughout four hours of music that The 
Ark, a local music venue, puts on each year. To begin 
this year’s second night, emcee Willy Porter roused 
the crowd for the first act, a bluegrass and roots-
rock group called Cold Tone Harvest. As audience 
members filed in through the auditorium’s gilded 
doors, they were met with the beautiful, yet gritty 
voice of the band’s lead vocalist, over a soundscape of 
rhythmic slide guitar and bouncing drums. Though 
the group played only three songs during their act, 
they set the tone for the rest of the night with a warm 
sense of intimacy. 
After Cold Tone Harvest, Tulsa, Oklahoma. native 
John Moreland took the stage with his musical 
partner and guitarist John Calvin Abney, both of 
whom are monumental talents in their own right. 
Moreland is the kind of songwriter that makes you 
forget everything that’s happening around you, his 
deep voice wielding the kind of gravitas that only 
comes from years of careful practice. As he played 
several songs from his upcoming album, Abney’s 
trills and riffs added a brilliant dose of treble to the 
songwriter’s emotive lyrics and cadenced guitar 
strumming. Moreland is a big guy, but his stage 
presence dwarfs any physical attributes he might 
have. It is hard to fill an auditorium of Hill’s size with 
one person’s voice alone, but he achieved it easily, 
moving the audience with each line of his roots-
rock stylings. If soul is what sets folk music apart 
from other genres, Moreland is its poster boy. His 
performance reminds us of why large events like the 
Ann Arbor Folk Festival are critical: They highlight 
lesser-known but immensely talented artists with 
time on the big stage. 
Moreland is a tough act to follow under any 

circumstance, 
but 
Nashville 
songwriter 
and 
acclaimed guitarist Molly Tuttle is one of the only 
people who could match his intensity and talent. 
The first woman to win the International Bluegrass 
Music Association’s Guitar Player of the Year award, 
Tuttle’s flatpicking skills are incredible to watch and 
even more of a gift to hear. Paired with the singer’s 
clear and stirring voice, her songs call to mind the 
kind of timeless music folk is built on. At the peak of 
one chorus, Tuttle’s precision both with the guitar 
and her own vocals left the audience in awe, with the 
typical whoops of support and enjoyment quieted 
as each note echoed through the auditorium. She 
approaches music like a surgeon would a body. In 
many ways, her live performance is a spectacle of 
both heartfelt commitment and incredible technical 
prowess.
Following the theme of female empowerment 
and skill, Tuttle’s talent was matched by the next act, 
R&B legend Bettye Lavette. The Detroit singer began 
her career in the early days of Motown, and decades 
later, Lavette has gotten back on the horse to show 
audiences her unforgettable voice and inimitable soul 
once again. Her performance was full of laughter and 
wit, with Lavette’s raspy voice carrying each song 
with jokes and false exits. Near the end of the set, she 
admitted to the audience that she was out of breath, 
proceeded to dance off the stage in her black velvet 
jumpsuit and came back a minute later with the fervor 
and stage presence only a veteran of the industry can 
embody. For a woman of advanced age, Lavette’s 
spark is still as bright as it ever was, her raw talent and 
gregarious personality pulling the audience in with 
every word that came out of her painted-red mouth. 
The festival could have easily ended with Lavette’s 
magnetic performance, and yet, the two headliners 
hadn’t even played yet. As Lavette danced through 
the stage doors once more, this time not returning, 
cleverly-named North Carolina duo Mandolin 
Orange prepared for a set full of grace and emotional 
clarity.

Daily Arts Writer

Not many things in life are truly black or white. There will always be 
more unanswered questions than answered, and the ethics behind our 
choices are often what make these questions nearly impossible to solve. 
Despite this headache that morality drags us into, many would agree 
that part of our responsibility on Earth is, to some extent, recognize 
that working to solve moral dilemmas is far better than ignoring them 
altogether. “Bojack Horseman” knows this and, through its entire six-
season run, has never been afraid to shout into the void to try and get the 
message across that “the truth is none of it matters and the truth is it all 
matters tremendously.”
In this eight-episode conclusion to the show’s final season, everything 
is the same and everything is different. The first half of the final season 
left us in a transition period in each character’s life and with a cliffhanger 
that hinted at the fateful culmination of Bojack’s (Will Arnett, “Riviera”) 
mistakes. The second half leans into the anxiety that was built up 
surrounding Bojack’s rocky attempt to be a better, sober person and 
capitalizes on the fear but logical expectation he’ll relapse into the “old 
Bojack” that everyone’s so resentful of.
In the last season in particular, the show begs the question of whether 
people should be allowed to move on or should have to remain plagued by 
the mistakes of their past. Bojack, caught up in the wake of the #MeToo 
movement, finally faces legal and societal backlash as the secrets 
surrounding Sarah Lynn’s (Kristen Schaal, “Bob’s Burgers”) death air to 
the public. Bojack, like all flawed characters, causes internal conflict for 
the show’s viewers and at times forces them to choose whether they stay 
hopeful that Bojack will improve, or hold him to the same cancel culture 

standard most powerful Hollywood men have been held to in the past 
few years. It makes us wonder whether people can really change, or if 
they’re bound to the chains of their toxicity. And if people really can 
change, to what extent should we hold them accountable for the actions 
of their old self?
A distinctive characteristic of the show is its consistently unforgettable 
penultimate episodes. Always pivotal, always poignant and always 
action-packed, these episodes have been a marker for how meticulous 
the creators can be and how human this fantasy-like show really is. Each 
character, no matter how profusely they deny it, is a product of their past. 
In between the puns, the movie references and the absurd escapades, 
the show is filled with existentialism and profound one-liners that make 
“The Good Place” seem like a children’s show.
This final season is different in that it intentionally includes all the 
ethical discussions the show kept relatively subliminal in prior seasons. 
In its penultimate episode, characters — which I’ll leave undisclosed to 
avoid exposing crucial plot points — are literally having these discussions 
around the dinner table. In a game called “Best Part/Worst Part,” the 
characters debate sacrifice, happiness and the best and worst parts of 
their lives. It emulated what the fans have been doing over the past six 
years — analyzing, discussing, interpreting.
Even though I know all good things must come to an end, I can’t help 
but pine for more. This last season is the most precise, carefully-crafted 
the series has ever been, and yet there’s a part of me that knows it wasn’t 
their peak. Thankfully, the creators tied all the necessary loose ends 
to wrap up the show in exactly the way it was supposed to be, and we 
can only hope television doesn’t peak with this series. Good things are 
fleeting and their fleeting nature is often what makes them so special. 
And like Diane (Alison Brie, “Horse Girl”) says, some things “were never 
meant to be in your life forever.”

There’s a certain type of person you’ve probably encountered 
in grade school. Perhaps you were this person yourself. This was 
the person who didn’t just like to read — reading was part of their 
identity. The one who was on a first name basis with the librarian; 
the one who finished all the Harry Potter books by middle school; 
the one who always had a book on their desk and it was always 
thicker than a dictionary; the one who, when the Scholastic Book 
Fair came to school, arrived with two crisp twenty dollar bills and 
put more thought into their purchases than most would into buying 
a car. You get the idea. Chances are, this person doesn’t read so 
much anymore. Maybe they haven’t found the time or just haven’t 
gotten around to making that trip to the library, but of course, deep 
down they know that they just don’t enjoy reading as much as they 
used to. This experience is encapsulated by Erin Morgenstern’s 
“The Starless Sea.”
The book is an amalgamation of interconnected narratives 
experienced by the main character, Zachary. It starts with him 
finding a book in a college library that tells of an event from his 
own life that he’s never told anyone about. What follows is a fairy-
tale-like adventure where Zachary is taken from story to story, 
about everything from pirates to princesses to painters. In what 
is essentially a story about stories, he rides this rollercoaster of 
fantastical narratives, guided by the eccentric characters he meets 
along the way.
My initial impulse was to hate this book. The plot is all over 
the place and often confusing, which is not surprising given that 
it tries to incorporate so many simultaneous subplots. The main 
plot is frequently interrupted with short stories whose relevance 
is sometimes unclear, even by the end. There is, for example, a 
three page story about a man who collects keys. Though keys are 
a prominent symbol in the book, the book never revisits the key 
collector. In this instance the story serves to clarify the meaning 
of the symbol, but doesn’t advance the plot. These ambiguous 

interludes are stretched out across nearly five-hundred pages, 
making it nearly impossible to keep track of relevant characters and 
plot points.
This unfortunately also produces many underdeveloped side 
characters, like the key collector, who disappear as effortlessly as 

they’re introduced. One could overlook this if the main characters 
were complex and memorable enough, but even Zachary seems to 
just be along for the ride rather than an active participant in the 
action. He meanders between whimsical tales without any real 
purpose aside from a desire to continue the story. “The Starless Sea” 
has all the warning signs of a bad book. 
However, I still found myself eager to continue, to find out 
about what subsequent wondrous adventure Morgenstern had in 
store for me. This is a book one can enjoy if one lets go of the need 
to make sense of it and gives in to its elegant chaos. The beautiful 
prose works to construct incredibly rich and imaginative worlds. 
For instance, the shores of the Starless Sea, the place the book is 
named after, houses entrances to the “labyrinth” of stories that 
Zachary traverses. This physical location is described in a manner 
that mirrors the interconnectedness of literature as a whole, a major 
theme of the book. Morgenstern can build this intricate image 
and just as easily transition to a chapter about a dinner party or 
an intimate conversation between lovers. “The Starless Sea” is, in 
short, a spectacle. 
When reading it, one feels a sense of nostalgia for a time when 

reading was for its own sake. The sheer imagination of Morgenstern’s 
stories combined with the sense of familiarity brought by the 
incorporation of classic literary motifs take you back to a time when 
you sat in bed late at night, effortlessly engrossed in book after book. 
Reading “The Starless Sea” is a bittersweet experience. It evokes the 
feelings associated with reading a truly great book without being 
a great book itself. It summons nostalgia for the childlike sense 
of wonder that many once felt when reading. Yet, like all forms of 
nostalgia, the feeling is fleeting. It’s like a diet Coke or a decaf coffee. 
You know exactly what it’s supposed to be and, therefore, exactly 
what you don’t have. Readers of “The Starless Sea” are similarly left 
wanting the real thing. Its value is in the evocation of the experience 
of reading without expectation, of reading simply to read.

‘The Starless Sea’ is the perfect book for book lovers

FILM REVIEW
Sundance 2020: ‘Nine Days’ questions nearly everything

What happens after we die? It’s an eternal question, one that humans 
have asked time and time again but will likely never know the answer to. 
“Nine Days” asks the exact opposite question: What happens before we’re 
born? The premise of the movie was intriguing enough to give it a watch; 
why do we focus so much on our future without any regard for our past? 
“Nine Days,” directed by Edson Oda (“Malaria”), does an admirable job of 
focusing on the other end of the biological timeline.
Will (Winston Duke, “Black Panther”) is tasked with judging who is 
allowed to be born. He informs every candidate who arrives at his house, a 
place where people are neither dead nor alive, of the same thing: “You are 
being considered for the amazing opportunity of life.” Over the next nine 
days, Will tests them and determines if they’re strong enough to survive 
in the real world. If they are, they become a newborn. If not, they simply 
vanish into the air, becoming a part of the white desert that surrounds 
them. It’s easy to believe that Oda’s middle ground world, while fictional, 
actually does exist. You can see yourself in Mike (David Rysdahl, “That’s 
Not Us”), the shy, insecure candidate who constantly feels like he’s not 
good enough, or Maria (Arianna Ortiz, “Parenthood”) who only craves 
bike rides and the outdoors. At a certain point, you start to believe that any 
of these people could have been you. The specific set of circumstances 
that led to you being born is monumental. We’re lucky to be in this world, 

but we live as if this life was always meant to be. It wasn’t.

Much of “Nine Days” revolves around the relationship between Will 
and Emma (Zazie Beetz, “Deadpool 2”), a free-spirited, headstrong young 
woman who doesn’t care for Will’s tests or questions. She wants to live 
on her own terms. As a character, Emma is predictable as the one that 
breaks the conventional mold. Even so, Duke’s and Beetz’s performances 
perfectly complement each other; every interaction sends fiery sparks 
flying through the theater. Oda crafts a beautifully juxtaposed duo 
without hinting at any romantic relationship between the two, an easy 
misstep that would’ve taken away much of the magic.
Even with such a somber theme, Oda manages to sprinkle in lots of 

humor and vitality. Kyo (Benedict Wong, “The Martian”), Will’s helper, 
offsets Will’s melancholy aura, giving the audience something firm to 
grasp onto in a world of altered realities. Alexander (Tony Hale, “Arrested 
Development”) offers the predicted and appreciated punchlines, the 
awkward stumbling and bumbling reminiscent of a newborn taking their 
first steps. There’s nothing funny about people ceasing to exist when 
they’re not selected, but the humor still lands well.
A cloudy Utah morning greeted me when I walked out of the theater, 
but it felt like the sun was shining on me, rays cascading into my heart. 
This film makes you think, feel and love life. “Nine Days” may be one of 
the most thought-provoking films to come out of Sundance 2020.

FILM REVIEW
Sundance 2020: ‘Possesor’ offers shock but little else

What does it take to earn the accolade of “most fucked-up 
film at Sundance 2020?”
That’s the (unofficial) badge of honor “Possessor” wears. The 
Sundance representative introducing the film at the screening 
acknowledged that “mindfuck” is an overused descriptor for 
psychological films, but promised this was a movie worthy of 
the word.
The premise surely lends itself to a mindfuck. Tasya Vos 
(Andrea Riseborough, “The Grudge”) is an assassin who uses 
brain-implant technology to take over a host body, controlling 
it to kill targets for high-paying clients. The story revolves 
around a flashy murder mission: the assassination of a high-
profile CEO — fittingly played by Sean Bean (“Drone”) who is 
notorious for dying violently in all his roles — committed by 
the hostbody of Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott, “It Comes At 
Night”), the target’s daughter’s boyfriend.
Implied to have numerous successful assassinations under 
her belt, Tasya’s mind is breaking under the trauma of so 
many killings and body takeovers. Everything unravels as she 
inhabits Colin’s body. Abbott carries most of the film’s weight. 
Playing Tasya-controlling-Colin is a very specific character to 
capture, especially considering the movie gives no indication 
of Colin’s personality until Tasya has already taken over. It’s 

obvious in the way Abbot’s vaguely detached on-screen energy 
resembles Riseborough’s performance from the beginning 
of the film. Colin’s girlfriend Ava (Tuppence Middleton, 
“Downton Abbey”) often notes that he’s acting funny, but that’s 
not the main indicator that something’s off. It’s the dissonance 
between Abbott portraying Tasya’s detachment and all the 
hints of the real Colin’s wild lifestyle: sleeping with the CEO’s 
daughter in her swanky apartment, drinking and drug-doing 
with his friends, messing around with another girl on the side.
While “Possessor” has the potential to dive deep into a world 
in which remote body-control assassinations are possible, it 
rejects this direction and instead devotes itself to the exhibition 
of a psychological breakdown. Tasya’s assassination mission 
and its worldly consequences are unimportant; her psychosis 
is, and so is the internal battle of will between her and Colin 
over control of his body.
If “Possessor” had focused on a grander world and story in 
which brain-implant assassination is just a novelty mechanism 
to drive the plot, it would probably be an irrelevant, purposeless 
film. But the movie isn’t about telling a story, or even sharing a 
higher message. It’s a film about literally getting into people’s 
heads, and it’s hell-bent on getting into its viewers’ heads too. 
To that end it is gruesome, gory, unsettling and unforgiving. 
Oftentimes when depicting something violent or graphic in a 
movie, the viewer can have faith that the most uncomfortable 
moments will be kept offscreen. “Possessor” takes that 
expectation, builds on it until you’re fully confident they 

wouldn’t actually show that, then skewers it with a fire iron.
I didn’t walk out of the theater after “Possessor” feeling 
changed. I didn’t develop a nuanced understanding of a 
subject, I didn’t grow attached to the characters, I wasn’t 
inspired to tears or compelled to take action. None of that. I 
just felt mindfucked. I don’t cope well with body horror, and 
I nearly walked out three times. In fact, the director, Brandon 
Cronenberg (“Antiviral”) is the son of acclaimed director and 
body horror pioneer David Cronenberg. There’s surely lots of 
intentional symbolism and underlying meaning to dig out of 
multiple rewatches. But I’m not interested in digging. I will be 
leaving my experience of watching “Possessor” with my time 
at Sundance.

Michigan dispatches Michigan State, 
prepares for Big Ten Championships

Land der Berge, Land am 
Strome — the national anthem 
of Austria— played in Canham 
Natatorium to open up the 
swim and dive meet on Friday 
night against Michigan State 
(8-7-1, 1-4-1) on the Michigan 
men and women swim teams’ 
senior 
night. 
Senior 
Felix 
Auböck 
from 
Austria, 
the 
NCAA champion in the 1,650-
yard freestyle, had never heard 
his anthem in his four years 
swimming at Michigan.
Auböck, 
inspired 
by 
his 
national anthem, led the third-
ranked Michigan men’s swim 
(6-1, 4-1) team to a 195-76 win 
over the Spartans with a victory 
in 
the 
200-yard 
freestyle. 
Meanwhile, the No. 1 Michigan 
women’s swim team (6-0, 4-0) 
defeated Michigan State 181-83, 
led by senior Miranda Tucker 
with three event wins. Both 
the men’s and women’s teams 
got off to fast starts, taking 31-5 
and 31-4 leads, respectively. 
From there, the Wolverines 

dominated, 
with 
the 
men 
winning all 16 events, and the 
women taking 15 events out of 
16.
The 
last 
dual 
meet 
of 
the season was fine-tuning 
for 
Michigan, 
with 
many 
swimmers competing in races 
which they do not usually 
compete. 
Tucker, 
usually 
dominant in the breaststroke, 
won the women’s 100-yard 
freestyle, women’s 200-yard 
freestyle and women’s 100-yard 
IM.
The Wolverines’ men’s and 
women’s teams won in both 
the 400-yard medley relay and 
200-yard freestyle relay, with 
sophomore Maggie MacNeil 
almost breaking the pool record 
for the 100 yard-backstroke on 
the leadoff leg with a time of 
51.87.
On the men’s side for dive, 
junior Ross Todd finished first 
in both the one-meter and the 
three-meter, with senior Jake 
Herremans finishing second in 
the one-meter and junior Chris 
Canning finishing second in the 
three-meter.

The 
Wolverines 
now 
look ahead to the Big Ten 
Championships at the end of 
the month in Iowa City.
“We’re going to be in a battle,” 
Michigan coach Mike Bottom 
said. “Indiana on the women’s 
side are the champions, Ohio 
State lost fewer people than 
anybody last year … on the 
women’s side we have a shot.”
He 
noted 
how 
great 
swimmers 
such 
as 
Auböck 
and Tucker have been but 
emphasized how important it 
will be for the rest of the team 
to perform as they did against 
the Spartans.
“It’s going to be our number 
14 through 24 that are going to 
win the meet if we are going 
to win the meet,” Bottom said. 
“Our top end is going to what 
they’re going to do and score 
points.”
Sixteen 
seniors 
were 
honored 
on 
senior 
night, 
and though their careers at 
Canham Natatorium are over, 
they still have work to do and 
a title to earn in the Big Ten 
Championships.

Sophomore 
Andrew 
Fenty 
crouches low by the net while his 
doubles partner, junior Mattias 
Siimar, winds up for the serve. 
Siimar fires the ball into the 
back left corner of the service 
box where Western Michigan’s 
Jannik Opitz reaches out his 
racket for the return, sending a 
slow, uncontrolled ball back to 
the Wolverines. At the net, Fenty 
springs up raising his racket and 
bringing it down to smash the 
ball onto Western’s side of the 
court. All the Western duo can 
do is watch as the ball soars over 
their heads and Michigan scores 
another point.
Coming off a 4-2 win against 
No. 8 TCU, its first win against 
a top-10 team in nine years, the 
No. 16 Michigan men’s tennis 
team held on to close out the 
day with a win against Western 
Michigan, 4-2. 
Michigan came out firing 
on all cylinders in doubles, 
delivering convincing 6-2 and 
6-1 wins to head into singles 
with a 1-0 lead. The Wolverines’ 
excellent chemistry was on 
full display in the doubles 
matches 
as 
the 
Michigan 
players were constantly setting 
up 
opportunities 
for 
their 
teammates 
and 
encouraging 
each 
other 
throughout 
the 
match.
“It’s what our program is 
about,” Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg 
said. 
“Everything 
that we do is making teammates 
better on a daily basis. We 
live it — it’s not just words, all 
those words come to life every 
day in practice. What you see 
in the matches is what you do 
everyday.
“I can’t ask the guys to do 
it just on game day, and not 
be a great team player during 
the week. It’s something that 
I’ve believed in for 25 years of 
doing this — trying to take an 
individual sport and make it a 
team sport, and these guys are 
doing a great job of doing that.”
After a hot start to the day, 
Michigan stumbled to begin 

the singles matches with a 
number of close first sets as 
Western Michigan looked to 
potentially steal the day from 
the Wolverines.
Wins 
from 
Siimar 
(6-4, 
6-2) and senior Nick Beatty 
(7-6, 6-2), who both remain 
unbeaten in singles for the 
season, pushed the Wolverines’ 
point total to three. But senior 
Connor Johnston and junior 
Harrison Brown dropped their 
matches 6-4, 7-5 and 7-6, 6-3, 
respectively, leaving the match 
neck-and-neck at 3-2. 
With Michigan in need of one 
more point to close out the day, 
the spotlight turned to Fenty on 
the No. 1 singles court.
Coming off a key singles 
win against TCU earlier in the 
day and a dominating doubles 
performance, Fenty looked to 
have the momentum for another 
big 
win 
but, 
inexplicably, 
struggled. In the first set, 
Fenty committed a number 
of unforced errors and his 

opponent appeared to have him 
figured out as Western’s Opitz 
took the first set, 6-3. However, 
Fenty stormed back to dominate 
the following sets, 6-2 and 6-1, 
tallying the final point Michigan 
needed. 
Fenty attributed his struggles 
in the first set to a brief lapse in 
self confidence.
“I was thinking way too much 
about him, sometimes I dont 
think to myself about how good 
I am and how hard it is for him 
to play me,” Fenty said. “I got a 
couple games then I just took it 
to another level.”
After its performance today, 
Michigan continued to gain 
confidence and will be looking 
to carry that success through 
the rest of the season.
“We can beat anyone,” Fenty 
said. “We’re the team that’s 
tough to play home, away, 
anywhere you’ve got to go 
through us and we’re going to 
hustle and compete for every 
match, that’s how we do it.”

Harrison 
Brown 
was 
struggling, and everyone at the 
Varsity Tennis Center could hear 
it. 
The 
encouraging 
correspondence 
between 
Brown and his teammates, once 
consistently following each point, 
had reached the lowest volume of 
the night. The junior had just lost 
his third straight set of the day, 
each of which had necessitated 
at least a seventh game. After one 
match loss, he was staring down 
the barrel of a second when he 
suddenly faced a 3-0 deficit in the 
second set of his second match.
All of this was readily apparent 
if you just closed your eyes. 
Throughout 
the 
No. 
16 
Michigan men’s tennis team’s 
pair of wins last Saturday — a 
4-2 afternoon affair against No. 
8 Texas Christian and a 4-2 win 
that evening against Western 
Michigan — each Wolverines’ 

point 
was 
every 
teammate’s 
concern, and they let that be 
known loudly.
“It’s 
something 
that 
I’ve 
believed in for 25 years of doing 
this,” Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg said. “Trying to take 
an individual sport and make it 
a team sport, and these guys are 
doing a great job of doing that.”
After 
a 
surprisingly 
straightforward win over the 
Horned Frogs, the program’s 
first top-10 victory since 2011 — 
in which Michigan earned three 
consecutive straight-sets singles 
matches — the Wolverines relied 
on each other to keep the energy 
boiling over into the nightcap. 
Junior Mattias Siimar, who 
just hours earlier had clinched 
the fourth and final point for 
Michigan’s first win of the day, 
was mired in a pattern of unforced 
errors during his No. 1 doubles 
match.
The remedy? 
Positive communication with 
his partner, sophomore Andrew 

Fenty. Having overcome his earlier 
poor 
play, 
Siimar’s 
powerful 
serves elicited weaker and weaker 
returns — plenty of fodder for 
Fenty, waiting at the net, to smash 
over the back curtain.
“Mattias and I have great 
chemistry,” Fenty said. “He’s 
honestly very easy to play with. 
We lead the team when we play — 
our energy, I think everyone can 
feed off that. It’s a good trickle-
down effect.”
During 
singles 
play, 
communication began with equal 
enthusiasm.
“We’re in this together, Harry, 
you and me!” senior Connor 
Johnston 
— 
who 
Steinberg 
describes as the team’s emotional 
leader — called toward Brown a 
few games into their respective 
matches. Johnston and Brown 
weren’t even on adjacent courts.
As 
Brown’s 
second 
set 
grinded on toward his defeat, 
the cheerful discourse began to 
lose his voice. The absence of 
Brown’s contributions underlined 
his difficulties as much as his 
opponent’s rising numbers on the 
scoreboard.
Johnston worked his own 
opponent deep into games but 
began to struggle on deuce points. 
Watching from the balcony, his 
teammates had a simple message 
for him.
“Deuce, boy!” 
It was a reminder that this 
crucial point was not a cause for 
worry, but for optimism. Johnston 
had already won three points. 
What was one more?
The Wolverines worked up the 
singles points they needed thanks 
to a pair of straight-sets wins and 
a dominant latter two sets from 
Fenty. 
“The best memory obviously is 
match point for Mattias (Siimar, 
against Texas Christian) and 
seeing the guys charge the court 
and dancing in the locker room 
after,” Steinberg said.
That may have been Saturday’s 
exclamation mark, but a win 
against Western Michigan was 
the period that concluded the 
story.
It was a period every player 
helped type.

‘M’ gets new perspective in Cuba trip

In October, the University of 
Michigan gives its students and 
faculty a long weekend as an 
annual fall break. For most, it’s a 
time to relax, catch up on work 
and spend time with family. For 
the Michigan softball team, it 
was a life experience. 
By 6:30 a.m. that Friday, the 
Wolverines were already loading 
the bus for their trip. Four hours 
later they were in the air — 
destination: Cuba.
Once in Havana, the team 
was charmed by the beautifully 
ornate architecture, the cars 
straight out of the 1950s and the 
delicious food. 
“The food was amazing,” 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
said. “We ate a lot of plantains. 
We ate a lot of vegetables and a 
lot of meat and rice. … Totally my 
kind of food. It was great.”
Hutchins 
couldn’t 
decide 
what food was best — the Cuban 
beef, chicken she described as 
fantastic or Cuba’s national dish, 
ropa vieja. She even claimed to 
have eaten so much meat that she 
went vegetarian for a week after 
returning home.
The 
Wolverines 
continued 

their trip on Sunday, away from 
Havana, by traveling to Viñales. 
There, they explored the caves, 
marveled at the mountains and 
visited a tobacco farm where 
some of the most famous Cuban 
cigars are made.
But these tourist spots and 
the food weren’t what defined 
the trip for Michigan. It was the 
people and what the team did 
with them that made it fantastic.
The team played two games 
against a Cuban softball team, 
one on Saturday and one on 
Monday. Despite the grounds of 
competition, the atmosphere was 
light. The teams spent much of 
the time interacting and talking 
with each other in addition to 
playing the game itself.
After 
Monday’s 
game, 
Michigan held a clinic for the 
Cuban team. They practiced 
everything from ground balls 
and hitting to putting rotation 
on pitches using a spinner.
At the same time, the Cuban 
team helped the Wolverines 
practice their Spanish. As most 
of the team struggled, to both 
the Cubans’ and Wolverines’ 
amusement, 
junior 
shortstop 
Natalia Rodriguez and senior 
outfielder Thais Gonzales helped 
bridge the language barrier so 

everyone could communicate 
more easily.
The clinic ended with a 
language 
both 
teams 
spoke 
fluently — dance. Music played 
from a speaker while the players 
gathered in a circle around each 
other, moving together to the 
beat.
After it all, Michigan gave 
the Cuban players their gloves, 
cleats and backpacks along with 
some other miscellaneous items 
they brought with them. 
Sophomore 
pitcher 
Alex 
Storako saw her outlook change 
after the experience.
“I think my biggest takeaway 
from Cuba is how fortunate 
we are to be able to go to this 
beautiful university and have 
the greatest experience this 
year,” Storako said. “This past 
year, everything we’ve gotten 
we’ve just been extra grateful 
for. Every little thing is just 
magnified for sure.”
In 
just 
five 
days, 
the 
Wolverines explored a country’s 
sights, ate tons of delicious 
food, had fun with new friends, 
learned a life lesson and came 
home with a fantastic answer to 
an inevitable question.
“What did you do over fall 
break?”

Sports
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Practice had already ended 
a while back, Monday at Yost 
Ice Arena. Yet there were still 
teachings to come.
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
had just finished answering 
questions 
from 
a 
group 
of 
reporters in the lobby of the 
hockey offices. He got up and 
headed to go join the rest of his 
staff, but at the last moment — 
just before disappearing around 
the corner — he turned back 
and called for the reporters’ 
attention.
Pearson 
had 
unfinished 
business.
Earlier that afternoon, the Big 
Ten had announced a one-game 
suspension on freshman forward 
Johnny Beecher for his actions 
during a brawl that erupted 
against Ohio State on Saturday at 
Yost. The suspension was slated 
to keep Beecher out of Friday’s 
home game against Wisconsin.
Pearson 
had 
already 
expressed his frustrations with 
the conference’s decision while 
sitting down, but wanted to show 
the reporters, visually, why he 
was annoyed. So, before going on 
with his day he invited the group 
to see a film breakdown of the 
events that led to the suspension. 
And 
in 
the 
brief 
session 
huddled around 
a TV that soon 
followed, 
he 
made 
sure 
to 
point 
out 
all 
that 
was 
wrong with the 
decision.
“I just totally 
disagree 
with 
the 
call, 
on 
the record,” Pearson had said 
prior. “There’s just so many 
things going on in that play and 
if you play the game of hockey 
long enough, you understand 

everything that was going on 
there and the context of it.”
Pearson was unhappy about 
how blame for the scuffle was 
assigned. The way he saw the 
play, Beecher did not start it. 
In recalling the 
event, 
Pearson 
pointed out that 
Beecher 
was 
rather 
peaceful 
when first entering 
the 
commotion 
created 
by 
forward 
Ronnie 
Hein, number 40 
for the Buckeyes. 
Hein had targeted 
Lockwood, 
getting him pinned against the 
bench and thus drawing in all 
the players. Pearson stressed 
that Beecher only retaliated after 
taking a few punches to the head.

“It’s total hypocrisy to me,” 
Pearson said. “You can write 
that, too, and I’ll probably get a 
slap on the wrist. But it is. Watch 
the video. The video doesn’t lie. 
It’s all right there if you watch it. 
Johnny might be the guy holding 
the gun, but there’s a lot of other 
things going on there.”
The hockey program provided 
The 
Daily 
with 
footage 
of 
the brawl, and the coach’s 
description fits the video quite 
accurately.
Pearson 
understands 
why 
Beecher got a penalty during 
the game but feels others, such 
as Hein, should’ve been held to 
the same standard. In his eyes, 
Hein’s actions were much more 
dangerous than Beecher’s. 
Following 
the 
outbreak, 
Beecher 
got 
a 
five-minute 
major for head-butting, a game 

misconduct plus a suspension 
— but the video depicts that 
Beecher’s head whip doesn’t 
hit the opposing player. Also, 
Lockwood received a minor 
for elbowing defenseman Ryan 
O’Connell before 
the fight broke out 
— but one could 
argue Lockwood’s 
hit was clean.
Yet 
Hein 
received 
just 
a 
minor 
for 
roughing 
while 
the rest of his 
team stayed out of 
the penalty box.
“I’m 
all 
for 
player safety and that, but Will 
Lockwood was in a much tougher 
position than Johnny ever put 
any of their players in,” Pearson 
said. “ ... Will Lockwood was 

bent over the bench backward 
and two of their players actually 
had hands on him while 40 is 
punching him.”
Pearson believes that the 
punishment Beecher received 
during 
the 
game 
was 
enough and that 
the suspension 
is simply over 
the top.
“He 
wasn’t 
putting 
anybody 
in 
danger, no one 
was 
getting 
hurt,” Pearson 
said. 
“Like 
there’s been things that have 
happened in our league this year 
where kids have been put in bad 
positions for serious injury. This 
was not like that.”

Freshman forward Johnny 
Beecher has been suspended for 
Michigan’s game on Friday night 
against Wisconsin, per a release 
from the Big Ten.
Early in the second period 
Saturday night’s 4-1 loss to Ohio 
State, Beecher was involved in 
a scrum around the Buckeyes 
bench and received a 5-minute 
major and a game misconduct 
for head butting an Ohio State 
player. The Big Ten has added 
a suspension Friday night as 
supplemental discipline.
Through 22 games this season, 
Beecher is third on the team in 
points with 12, seven goals and 
five assists. His seven goals rank 
second on the team and he leads 
all freshmen in points with one 
more than freshman defenseman 
Cam York.
Of late, Beecher has been 
centering a line with senior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood 
and freshman forward Nick 
Granowicz. Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson put the line together at 
Notre Dame in the first weekend 
of the second half and it has 
produced six goals in six games 
since then.
Without Beecher on Friday 
night, Pearson may turn to 
players like graduate transfer 
Jacob Hayhurst or redshirt 
junior Luke Morgan to fill his 
gap, both of whom have played 
center in the past but now play on 
the wing.

In Ohio State, Michigan sees its mirror image

Basketball is a game of runs. 
Both on the court and in the 
schedule.
A 
team 
will 
hit 
a 
big 
3-pointer, 
throw 
down 
a 
massive dunk or put together 
a dizzying take to the rim and 
all of a sudden, the momentum 
has shifted. Buckets — or wins 
— start coming and they seem 
to never stop. Or, as is much too 
often the case for teams in the 
Big Ten this season, shooting 
droughts and losses send a 
team down the rabbit hole of 
mediocrity.
Rarely though, does the 
season-long trajectory of two 
teams nearly mirror itself. 
Let alone rivals in the same 
conference.
That just so happens to be 
the case with the Michigan 
men’s basketball team and its 
opponent Tuesday: Ohio State.
Both 
clubs 
started 
the 
season off as hot as can be.
The Wolverines racked up 
some seemingly insignificant 
wins at home, then downed 
some of the nation’s top teams 
in The Bahamas. After its 
miracle 
stretch, 
Michigan 
held the No. 4 ranking in the 
country.
The 
Buckeyes, 
using 
a 
combination of bruising size 
in the paint, elite guard play 
and a smoldering defense, flew 
through the teams on their 
schedule leading to a six-point 
surprise win over then-No. 6 
Kentucky on Dec 21. Standing 
atop an 11-1 record and a top-10 
win, Ohio State held the No. 2 
ranking in the nation.
To add to the deja vu, both 
teams beat North Carolina.
“I’m sure everyone recalls 
a time earlier in the year 
where we both were at the 
top,” Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard said. “Like I said 
before, it’s the beginning of the 
season, there’s a lot of season 
to be played. But it’s also an 
example of the Big Ten. We 
have a really good conference, 
and there’s a lot of season to be 
played.”

Then, the high of both 
programs’ success began to 
wear off and each team slipped 
into the unforgettable rhythm 
of losing.
For the Wolverines, it all 
began when junior forward 
Isaiah 
Livers 
went down with 
a groin injury, 
triggering 
a 
four-game 
losing skid. For 
the 
Buckeyes, 
the losing took 
the form of an 
inexplicable 
inability 
to 
hit shots. This 
accumulated 
into a four-game losing streak 
of Ohio State’s own.
Even 
the 
Buckeyes’ 
and 
Wolverines’ 
losses 
were 
similar too. Add up losses in 
Minneapolis to Minnesota and 
against Penn State and you 
have a better picture of each 
program’s loss column.
The 
team 
to 
pull 
both 
programs out of the losing 
skid? Nebraska.
The 
Big 
Ten’s 
punching 
bag galvanized each program 
at just the right time to fix 

whatever errors the players 
were experiencing in their 
shooting 
mechanics 
or 
defensive communication. 
Perhaps the most baffling 
part of each team’s losing streak 
is the fundamental reasons 
why they were 
losing.
For 
Ohio 
State, 
this 
looked like an 
utterly stagnant 
offense. 
The 
team that waxed 
the 
Nittany 
Lions for over 
100 points now 
couldn’t 
even 
crack 
60 
for 
four straight games. The shots 
refused to fall.
For 
Michigan, 
defensive 
miscue after defensive miscue 
rendered 
any 
offensive 
momentum 
or 
valiant 
comeback attempt null and 
void.
But when they’re on, the 
Buckeyes seemed worthy of 
their former No. 2 spot. The 
positives jump off the page.
“They 
have 
great 
inside 
play,” Howard said. “Their 
guard play is doing a really 

good 
job 
of 
shooting 
the 
basketball. They have pretty 
much four or five stickers I 
would say that can shoot the 
3-ball very, very well. They’re 
quick. They do an excellent job 
of attacking the offensive glass. 
They’re an excellent defensive 
team.”
The thing about both teams’ 
flaws, though? They’re easily 
fixable — and both teams have 
proven they can overcome 
these obstacles. It all now 
comes down to which version 
of each of these programs will 
show up on Tuesday.
“The more we play to our 
advantage, I think that’s very 
important that we do that, 
that we not stay stagnant on 
offense and make sure that 
we communicate,” freshman 
forward Franz Wagner said. 
“I think when we do that we 
have an advantage on a lot of 
teams. But as you can see, how 
the season went, either you do 
those things and you win the 
game or you don’t and then 
we lose against a lot of teams 
where I felt like we could’ve 
won the game, and I feel like 
it’s gonna be the same thing 
tomorrow.”

Rauch’s motor lifts ‘M’

If you look at the stat 
sheets before a game, you 
wouldn’t expect to see much 
of sophomore guard Danielle 
Rauch. She’s not the leading 
scorer 
for 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team. 
Far from it, actually, as she 
averages just 1.3 points per 
game. Sometimes, she’ll even 
go an entire game without 
attempting a shot. 
But when you watch her 
play, you see a much different 
story. On defense, she keeps 
her feet moving and disrupts 
opponents’ offensive flow. On 
offense, she helps her point 
guard — sophomore Amy Dilk 
— direct traffic. When a loose 
ball hits the floor, she’ll be on 
the floor with it in moments. 
She’s everywhere.
For the first half of the 
season, Rauch was the backup 
point guard. With Dilk having 
a bit of a breakout season, she 
didn’t see much playing time, 
tallying less than ten minutes 
in each of the first six Big Ten 
games. Rauch was a role player, 
and she accepted that. 
But 
since 
senior forward 
Kayla Robbins’ 
season-
ending injury, 
Rauch 
has 
started on the 
wing for the 
Wolverines 
against 
Rutgers, 
Northwestern 
and 
Iowa. 
Though 
she 
wasn’t 
much 
of a scorer in any of those 
contests — she totaled just 
nine shot attempts over that 
stretch — her palpable energy 
had a clear impact on her 
teammates. 
“I 
love 
playing 
with 
Danielle because (of) her high 
energy. She’s always talking, 
she makes the hustle play,” 
Dilk said. “ … She really sets 
the tone for our team with the 
hustle plays, being aggressive, 
talking, communicating, just 

outworking everyone on the 
court.”
Even when Rauch goes to 
the bench, she’s often still the 
most energetic person on the 
floor. She claps after defensive 
stops, and leaps up to high-
five the rest of the bench after 
a three is made. That kind of 
energy — especially from a role 
player — can help the team stay 
positive when down. 
To be clear, it’s not that 
Rauch can’t score. She’s shot 
a respectable 44.4 percent 
from the field this season, 
including making 7-of-17 from 
three. In Thursday’s loss at 
Northwestern, she buried a 
3-pointer that cut the Wildcats’ 
lead to three midway through 
the fourth quarter. 
She just recognizes she’s 
on a team full of elite scorers. 
Junior forward Hailey Brown 
is a sharpshooter at her best. 
Dilk and senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson 
can 
embarrass 
a 
defense on their way to the 
hoop. Sophomore forward Naz 
Hillmon is a borderline Big Ten 
Offensive Player of the Year 
candidate. Rauch can score, but 
her teammates change games. 
“Danielle is very unselfish,” 
Hillmon 
said. 
“She’s an energy-
giver, never an 
energy-taker, 
so she wants to 
give me the ball, 
she wants to give 
AK the ball, she 
wants 
to 
give 
Hailey the ball. 
But we’ve really 
been 
working 
in practice like 
‘D, you need to get the ball. 
You’re just as good a shooter as 
anybody on the team.’ ”
Rauch has taken a difficult 
role — filling in for the team’s 
second-leading scorer — and 
embraced it. She may not 
appear on the stat sheet as 
much as her teammates, but 
she’s still a vocal leader on 
the team. Maybe it’s the point 
guard in her. Maybe she’s 
trying to prove something. 
Either way, that energy’s not 
going away.
