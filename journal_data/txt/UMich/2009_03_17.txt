MSA candidates talk platforms

Despite heated race,
few sparks fly in
debate last night
By JENNA SKOLLER
Daily StaffReporter
At a debate last night in advance
of the upcoming Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly elections set to take
place tomorrow and Thursday, the
audience of about 100 people was
split down the middle.
In support of their respective
presidential and vice presiden-

tial candidates, ReMichigan's red
shirts sat to the right, Michigan
Vision Party's green shirts sat to
the left and the Defend Affirma-
tive Action Party sat in the front of
the Palmer Common's auditorium
during the nearly two-hour event
that included a discussion of each
party's plan to reform MSA.
The presidential candidates -
DAAP's Kate Stenvig, a Rackham
graduate student, MVP's Abhishek
Mahanti, an Engineering junior
and reMichigan's Gibran Baydoun,
an LSA junior - took questions
from debate moderator Prof. Scott
Page, a former MSA president from

1984-1985.
Though Page asked the candi-
dates questions about their quali-
fications and managerial styles,
one of the most apparent themes
in the debate surrounded the Stop
the Hike Campaign, an initiative to
freeze tuition at the University.
The candidates had a minute
and a half to answer Page's ques-
tions, which were collected from
interested students. There were no
rebuttals, but Page was permitted
to ask follow-up questions.
Mahanti said that though he
thinks tuition is too high, a tuition
freeze might not be the answer

because of possible future reper-
cussions. He said MSA should take
advantage of its potential to help
students with issues like finding
affordable textbooks and getting
financial aid.
"if we do freeze tuition, it might
jump up later, itrnightnot; we don't
exactly know what the repercus-
sions may be," he said. "But when
it comes to financial aid, it's some-
thing that we have to hold Provost
(Teresa) Sullivan to when she says
that financial aid will increase
if tuition increases, at the same
rate."

Coleman:'U'will grow

Engineering students

By MALLORY BEBERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
As they watched Kenyan commu-
nity members search the Internet
for the first time, three University
graduates learned there is nothing
more satisfying than impacting the
lives of others through one's own
hard work.
Last November, three graduate
students from the College of Engi-

neering traveled to remote loca-
tions in Kenya to establish Internet
connections using their own satel-
lite-system designs.
The trip was the result of the
work done by 25 students in the
aerospace system design classes
taught by Thomas Zurbuchen, pro-
fessor of aerospace engineering and
atmospheric, oceanic and space
science. In the classes, students
were challenged to design a satel-
lite-based system that would bring
Internet to rural parts of the world.
Kelly Moran, who graduated in
December with an Engineering
master's degree, was among those
who ventured to Kenya.
She said the class first focused on

University President Mary
Sue Coleman delivered her
annual update to the faculty's
top governing body yesterday, at
the Senate Assembly's monthly
meeting in Palmer Commons.
. Coleman touched on a wide
range of issues, including the
University's announcement that
it would purchase the former
Pfizer Inc. complex on North
Campus, its budget planning,
and its recently completed fund

development effort, The Michi-

Talking about the University's
budget, Coleman said everything
is on schedule and should be
ready to present to the University
Board of Regents in June.
Coleman said the University is
continuouslyworkingtoimprove,
despite tough economic times.
"I'm not satisfied trying to just
keep us where we are," she said.
"We have to come out of this
recession stronger than we went

Coleman indicated she is opti-

The king of sing-along

While most students may go to
Good Time Charley's on 1140 S. Uni-
versity Ave. to loosen up after a hard
day of classes or to have a wild night
after a long week, Ann Arbor resi-
dent Tim Smith goes to Charley's for
one reason only - to experience the
Tuesday night karaoke.
Smith, a Jackson, Mich. native,
has been singing at Charley's on the
bar's Tuesday karaoke nights for
about eight months. He moved to
Ann Arbor in July to be closer to his
girlfriend.
Smith, 49, was part of a band in
high school and said that music has
always been an integral part of his
life. A member of three local bands
in Grand Rapids for about a decade
during the '90s, Smith was lead sing-
er for both Nervous Habit and Exit
and later a guest singer with Tril-
ogy.
Smith eventually became a kara-
oke host in Livonia.
Now the new business develop-

ment manager for Yarema Die &
Engineering, a metal and industrial
supply company based in Troy, Mich.,
Smith first started hosting karaoke in
the early '90s to keep himself busy at
night. He eventually developed a pas-
sion for the spirited performances.
"One week you see someone get up
to sing a song for the first time and
within a few weeks they are singing
five songs and you can heartheir voic-
es develop," Smith wrote in an e-mail
interview. "It really is a lot of fun to
watch and sing."
Smith said he enjoys Charley's
because of its fun and lively atmo-
sphere.
"Good Time Charley's is a great,
clean place for people to come sing
and hang with the college kids," he
said. "It gets crazy, but not out of con-
trol, great food, and the sound system
is good."
Smith said he's drawn to karaoke
because every night is a new experi-
ence with the new faces and voices

who grace the bar with their stage
presences..
"The whole thing about karaoke is
to get people who sing in their show-
ers and in their cars to get out and
sing," he said. "Every night at karaoke
is justunique. It's pretty much always
fun. You get a lot of fresh people to
sing all the time."
Smith, who prefers karaoke to
other forms of nightly entertainment,
said music is a feeling that allows
people to express themselves and be
more in touch with their emotions.
"Music itself is a mood-changing
type of media," he said. "You can be
in a bad mood, and listen to a song
you grew up with - doesn't matter
howold you are - itjust changesyour
mood."
Ifyou're ever at Charley's on aTues-
day night and you hear some Journey
lyrics blaring from the speakers, stay
and have a listen - Smith might be
singing "Don't stop believin'."

President angry over
AIGs "recklessness
and greed"
WASHINGTON (AP) - Joining
a wave of public anger, President
Barack Obama blistered insur-
ance giant AIG for "recklessness
and greed" yesterday and pledged
to try to block it from handing its
executives $165 million in bonus-
es after taking billions in federal
bailout money.
"How do they justify this out-
rage to the taxpayers who are
keeping the company afloat?"
Obama asked. "This isn't just a
matter of dollars and cents. It's
about our fundamental values."
Obama aggressively joined
other officials in criticizing
American International Group,
the company that is fast becom-
ing the poster boy for Americans'
bailout blues even as it protests
that the bonuses were required by
employee contracts.
The bonuses could contribute
to a backlash against Washing-
ton that would make it tougher
for Obama to ask Congress for
more bailout help - and jeopar-
dize other parts of the recovery
agenda that is dominating the
start of his presidency. Thus, the
president and his top aides were
working hard to distance them-
selves from the insurer's conduct,
to contain possible political dam-
age and to try to bolster public
confidence in his administration's
handling of the broader economic
rescue effort.
David Axelrod, senior adviser
to Obama, said in an interview
with The Associated Press that
there was no question that the
bonuses and the public's anger
over them could run many things
off the rail. "People are angry
because they've seen exhibit after
exhibit of irresponsibility and
people walking away with money
in their pockets," he said. "It's
undermined the discussion that
we have to have."
Obama had scheduled a speech
yesterday to announce new help
for recession-pounded small busi-
nesses. But first, he said, he had a
few words to say about AIG. He
lost his voice at one point and ad-
libbed, "Excuse me, I'm choked

up with anger here." It was just
a light aside, but he meant the
sternness of his remarks to come
through.
"This is a corporation that finds
itself in financial distress due to
recklessness and greed," Obama
declared.
He said he had directed Trea-
sury Secretary Timothy Geithner
to "pursue every legal avenue to
block these bonuses and make the
American taxpayer whole."
Later, White House spokesman
Robert Gibbs said the adminis-
tration would modify the terms
of a pending $30 billion bailout
installment for AIG to at least
recoup the $165 million the
bonuses represent. That wouldn't
rescind the bonuses, just require
AIG to account for them differ-
ently.
Axelrod called the bonuses
"spectacularly tone-deaf."
He said the administration
hopedthetoughtalk wouldresultin
voluntary action on the part of AIG
and its bonus recipients, although
that remains an open question. "All
we can do is administer this thing
going forward," he said.
A call to AIG's corporate head-
quarters in New York seeking
comment was not returned imme-
diately late yesterday.
On a separate track, New
York Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo said yesterday he would
issue subpoenas for information
on the bonuses after AIG missed
his deadline for providing details.
Cuomo said his office would
investigate whether the employ-
ees were involved in AIG's near-
collapse and whether the $165
million in bonus payments were
fraudulent under state law.
AIG spokeswoman Christina
Pretto told The Associated Press,
"We are in contact with the attor-
ney general and will of course
respond to his request."
One reason that the AIG bonus
giveaway is such a compelling
story " and a politically troubling
one for Obama if not neutralized
- is that it offers a simple story
line that appears to sum up ways
in which the federal bailouts have
gone awry.
"This is just the kind of issue
that galvanizes public outrage,"
said Paul C. Light, professor of
public service at New York Uni-

versity. "It's always the tangible-
stuff, the things that ordinary
Americans can relate to."
Bailout steps for AIG totaling
over $170 billion since September
have effectively left the federal
government with an 80 percent
stake in the faltering insurance
giant.
Obama's comments came on
the same day a new poll showed
slippage in his approval rating.
The poll by the Pew Research
Center showed it dropped from
64 percent in February to 59 per-
cent this month amid divisions of
opinions over his economic pro-
posals and what the pollsters said
was a growing perception that the
president is listening more to his
party's liberals than to its moder-
ates.
Still, those surveyed. gener-
ally gave the president favorable
marks for doing as much ashe can
to try to fix the economy, and few
blame him for making the econo-
my worse.
Andrew Kohut, Pew's director,
said in an interview that people
are most angry with banks and
companies but there's also "push-
back against Washington gener-
ally. And, of course, the buck stops
with Barack Obama these days."
Obama's sharp words contin-
ued an insistent administration
drumbeat over the past few days
designed to pressure the bonus
recipients to forgo them. Thus far,
American International Group
officials have refused to rescind
the payments.
In a letter to Geithner over
the weekend, the government-
appointed chief executive of AIG,
Edward Liddy, said the bonuses
were legally binding obligations
and the firm's "hands are tied."
Still, pressure was building on
that issue - and on the government
to rework ith AIG bailout to make
sure the company repays as much
of the $170 billion as possible.
So far, the company has been
honoring its contracts with U.S.
and foreign banks, paying out
more than $90 billion in econom-
ic bailout funds to big banks and
others. The government agreed
to uphold those contracts when it
seized control of AIG in Septem-
ber, contendingthat failure would
bring even worse global economic
problems.

GM to close
midsize-car factory
for three weeks
General Motors Corp. will tem-
porarily close a midsize-car fac-
tory near Pontiac, Mich., for three
weeks due lower demand for its
products, a company spokesman
said yesterday.
GM's Orion Township plant,
which makes the Pontiac G6 and
Chevrolet Malibu, will close the
weeks of March 30, April 6 and
April 13 to "align production with
market demand," spokesman Chris
Lee said.
The factory has about 3,200
hourly workers who will get state
unemployment benefits and sup-
plemental pay from the company
that total about 85 percent of their
base pay.
The closure is specific to the
Orion plant's products and not part
of alarger company production cut,
Lee said.
NEW YORK
If government gets
way, Ruth Madoff
will get nothing
Prosecutors probing Bernard
Madoff's massive fraud are deter-
mined to leave his wife with almost
nothing after telling a Manhattan
court that they consider more than
$100 million in assets, most of it
listed in her name, the fruits of her
husband's crimes.
The government even includ-
ed a $39,000 Steinway piano and
$65,000 in silverware, both owned
by Ruth Madoff, in items it said it
will try to force the Madoffs to for-
feit. The list was in a three-page
document filed in U.S. District
Court late Sunday.
Brenda Sharton, a lawyer with
a Boston firm representing several
burned investors, said the govern-
ment's aggressive approach with
Ruth Madoff isn't surprising.
"I don't think it's unusual ...
given the magnitude of the fraud,"
she said. "It would be unusual if
they didn't go after whatever assets
they can get."
WASHINGTON
Obama plans boost
in lending for
small-businesses
Seeking to counter a chorus of
unhappy Republicans and nervous
Wall Street investors, President
Barack Obama and his economic
team are taking a cheerier tone
while making billions in federal
loans available to the nation's
struggling small businesses.
Obama and Treasury Secre-
tary Timothy Geithner yester-
day planned to announce a broad
package that includes reduced
small-business lending fees and an
increase on the guarantee to some
Small Business Administration
loans. A day earlier, the president's
adviserssaidintelevisioninterviews

that they remained confident in the
nation's economic fundamentals, at
times adopting upbeat rhetoric the
president once mocked.
"The fundamentals are sound
in the sense that the American
workers are sound, we have a good
capital stock, we have good tech-
nology," said Christina Romer, who
heads the White House Council of
Economic Advisers.d.

In report, faculty
members call for
greater protections

From Page 1
The report calls on the
regents and University admin-
istrators to create a policy that
will extend faculty members'
academic rights to include the
freedom of speech as defined in
this circumstance.
"We recommend that the Uni-
versity ... expand the definition of
academic freedom to cover speech
'on matters of public concern as
well as on matters related to pro-
fessional duties and the function-
ing of the university,' " the report
said.
According to the report, such
a change would protect faculty
members from a possible aca-
demic freedom issue, like the one
at the University of Wisconsin at
Milwaukee in the future.
"Such a change would have the
benefit of discouraging routine
use of administrative discipline
against professors who raise
internal criticisms against this
university's policies and their
implementation," SACUA wrote.
Although the full report is
posted on the regents' website,
the regents will not officially
receive the report until their
monthly meeting on Thursday
afternoon.
Classics and Law School Prof.
Bruce Frier, who helped draft the
report to the regents, said earlier
this month that the report was
meant to notify the regents of the
issue, but that he didn't expect
the regents to take action on it.
"It really is just a courtesy to
the regents," he said. "It's not
that I think anyone really expects
the regents to do anything (about
this) themselves."

Frier said SACUA wanted to
bring the issue before the regents
now, while the issue is not of
immediate concern, to avoid the
perception that the report had
any ties to a situation on campus.
"We wanted to proceed now
before there was a controversy
so it would not seem that when a
controversy eventually occurred
it was coming up in the context of
some specific debate," he said.
SACUA has already met with
the Office of the President, Office
of the Provost and the Office of
the General Counsel on the issue.
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham said the University
doesn't believe this is a topic of
concern or that anythingneeds to
be done about the issue.
"Our commitment to pro-
tecting faculty free speech is as
strong as ever," she wrote in an
e-mail. "(The court cases) do not
change our fundamental philoso-
phy and commitment to faculty
free speech and academic free-
dom."
In an exclusive interview yes-
terday, Provost Teresa Sullivan
said she didn't yet know enough
about the issue to choose a side.
"I don'thave a sufficientunder-
standing of (the cases)," she said,
adding that she would need to
review a legal memorandum on
the issue first.
Sullivan said that while there
isn't time to review the issue right
now, she may look into it over the
summer.
"I think that right now we
don't have time to get a complete
legal memorandum on this," she
said. "I'd like to see if General
Counsel can help me with that in
the summer."

President Mary Sue Coleman addresses the Faculty Senate Assembly yesterday to discuss the affairs of the University.

critical," she said. "We do believe
the University of Michigan will be
well-positioned."
Although the University may
receive additional money from the
federal stimulus package, Coleman
said the University would not use
that money for recurringexpenses.
"We will not pay ongoing
expenses of the operating budget
- that will have to be paid forever
- with one-time money," she said
of the stimulus funds.
Coleman stressed how impor-
tant faculty members were to the
success of the Michigan Differ-
ence campaign. The ,campaign,
which ended at the end of last
year, set the record for the largest
fundraising effort of any public
university in the United States.
"As I review what's happened
in the campaign, I am always
reminded of the participation

of the faculty and how much of
our faculty ... made what I con-
sider to be unbelievably gener-
ous donations to the University,"
she said.
Coleman also discussed the
University's plans to purchase
the Pfizer's former Ann Arbor
complex, saying the purchase will
advance the University's mission
and will help stimulate the econ-
omy.
"(This will) permit the Univer-
sity to do things it couldn't even
have dreamed of," she said: "(It
will) change the shape of the Uni-
versity."
University officials announced
in December they would purchase
the former Pfizer complex on
North Campus. The University is
currently in the due diligence pro-
cess in considering exactlywhat to
house in the facility. The closing
on the Pfizer deal is also expected
to be announced in June, barring
any unanticipated complications.
Another new addition to the
University that Coleman dis-
excited and really happy," she said.
"They thanked us over and over."
Joan Ervin, a graduate of the
College of Engineering, also trav-
eled to Kenya.
"You could feel that they under-
stood that this could really change
their lives," Ervin said. "They
wanted to learn how to do every-
thing for themselves."
Trisha Donajkowski, a fellow
graduate of the College of Engi-
neering and the third of the trio
to go to Kenya, said the system is
comprised of a satellite dish, a solar
panel, batteries and "electronics
that manage the modem and wire-
less router. She added that the sys-
tem is operated by a combination
of solar energy and battery power
to account for the many locations
without electricity.
Ervin said the system works
by transmitting a signal from the
computer to a satellite dish. The
satellite dish then relays the sig-
nal to a ground station in Europe
where the desired information is
retrieved and sent back to Africa
via the satellite.
"Basically we are bypassing all
the infrastructure that is usually
required," Zurbuchen said.
He said the system was installed
to create a type of Internet cafe,


cussed is the recently formed film
office. The new office will handle
the influx of requests from film
studios to film on campus, as a
result of the state's 40-percent tax
incentive for the film industry.
Coleman specifically talked
about the recent filming of Betty
Anne Waters - starring Hilary
Swank and Minnie Driver - that
filmed on campus over spring
break. The filming allowed hun-
dreds of students to serve as
extras and learn more about the
film production process, she
said.
On March 25, the University
will launch a new website to high-
light the University's accomplish-
ments and ongoing work, Coleman
said.
"(It will be) a one-stop shop
(with) easy to find information
about events that are of interest...
particularly to people involved in
some of our funding," she said.

Since the engineers left Kenya in
November, Moran said "everything
is really working well. They really
haven't had many major problems
that we've heard of."
She said government officials
are able to use the Internet to
send documents faster than in
the past. She added that citi-
zens have utilized the Internet to
learn about education, obtaining
a visa, agriculture and disease
prevention.
All the students involved agreed
that connecting Kenyans to the
rest of the world through prod-
ucts of their own labor was a life-
changing experience.
"I guess just my favorite thing
was just that I could do something
that I love," Donajkowski said. "I
could apply engineering in a way
that seemed like it mattered."
Ervin said the experience. has
made her realize what kind of work
she wants to do in the future.
"I think all of us are excited that
we got to work on something that
we actually went and built and
implemented it and saw the effects
of our work," she said. "It got us
all fired up about doing something
similar in the future."

Lawmakers to hold
hearings on bill
that would allow
same-sex marriage
MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -
Nine years after it played host
to a bitter fight over civil unions,
Vermont's Statehouse is again a
gay rights battleground.
More than 200 same-sex
marriage opponents, cheering
and wearing buttons that read
"Marriage - A Mother & Father
for Every Child," converged
Monday on Montpelier as law-
makers began a week's worth
of hearings on a bill that would
allow gay and lesbian couples to
marry.
If approved, Vermont would
join Massachusetts and Con-
necticut as the only U.S. states
that allow gay marriage.
The measure would replace
Vermont's first-in-the-nation
civil unions law with one that

allows marriage of same-sex
partners beginning Sept. 1.
Civil unions, which confer some
rights similar to marriage, would
still be recognized but no longer
granted after Sept. 1.
Supporters cast the debate as
a civil rights issue, saying a civil
unions law enacted by the state
in 2000 has fallen short of the
equality it promised same-sex
couples. Its appeal has declined,
too: In 2001, the state granted
1,876 civil unions, compared
with only 262 last year.
Passing a gay marriage bill "is
one of the most important civil
rights issues of our time," said
Greg Johnson, a Vermont Law
School professor who testified
before the state Senate Judiciary
Committee on Monday.
While the bill won't guaran-
tee federal benefits, supporters
say it would provide societal
recognition, improve access to
health benefits and eliminate
one of two obstacles to federal
protections such as Social Secu-
rity survivor benefits.

tered its attention on Africa.
"We focused a lot on the ground
system, how we could design a
low-cost system that's very easy to
deploy, easy to transport and sim-
ple to use," Moran said.
While the students never imag-
ined their designs wouldbe applied
to real-life scenarios, last summer
the program's sponsor, Google,
decided to turn their prototype
into reality.
Moran said after hearing about
Google's plans to finance their
trip to Kenya, "we were just blown
away, we couldn't believe it."
Once they knew their systems
would be used, Moran said real-
life conditions like heat and dust
had to be taken into consider-
ation.
Moran said the Kenyan commu-
nities they helped received them
with open arms. She added that
as she and her team entered a site,
residents would run alongside the
trucks and offer to help with the
assembly process.

Te end of a regime
New drug czar should focus on treatment, prevention
lthough the title may sound like something you would
call a drug cartel's leader, "drug czar" is actually the
name of the official in charge of federal drug control pol-
icy. Under the George W. Bush administration, this role was ele-
vated to a Cabinet-level position - a move that President Barack
Obama is reversing with his pick for the job. Obama's choice for
drug czar could signal a much-needed change in the nation's drug
enforcement policies since the individual in question is likely to
be a supporter of a more reasonable drug policy. Obama's admin-
istration - and his new drug czar - should live up to expecta-
tions by adopting policies that treat drug users as people with
addictions rather than as criminals.

Free speech is sexy

it's easyto take for granted the fact
that the Daily prints without any
University oversight. Indepen-
dence from admin-
istrative control
is vital so that our
content can main-
tain its objectiv-
ity and responsibly
assess University
institutions. While rt
the need for an
independent stu- ROBERT
dent newspaper
may seem obvious, SOAVE
the reality is that
there are troubling
events on other campuses that under-
mine these principles of objectivity
that newspapers value so highly.
Kristen Juras, an assistant law pro-
fessor at the University of Montana,
recently took issue with the content
of the university's student newspa-
per, the Montana Kaimin (Sex Column
causes controversy; First Amendment
issues raised, 03/11/09). Her problem
was with the Kaimin's sex column,
entitled "Bess Sex Column." Its author,
Bess Davis, is the Kaimin's first sex
columnist, though newspaper editor-
in-chief, Bill Oram, noted in his Mar.
12 article "Sex column adds to campus
discussion," the Kaimin is hardly the
first student newspaper to add a sex
column.
Juras called the sex column
"embarrassingly unprofessional"
and demanded action. She wants the
Kaimin to establish written rules for
hiring writers that would eliminate
inappropriate content. If her demands
are not met, Juras is promising to take
the issue to the Publication Board, the
Board of Regents and even the Mon-
tana legislature.
The Kaimin's situation immediately
raises several questions. The first is,
"What is a kaimin?" (The newspa-
per's website depicts the outline of a
bear-like creature, but a Google Image
Search of the word "kaimin" didn't
offer me any clues.)
Of course, the more relevant ques-

Obama. announced last Wednesday that
he would appoint Gil Kerlikowske to be
the nation's new drug czar. As Seattle's
police chief for more than eight years, Ker-
likowske has hands-on experience in deal-
ing with the often devastating impact drug
use can have on communities.
In addition to this pick, Obama has
decided not to continue the drug czar as a
Cabinet-level position, possibly indicating
a more laid-back approach' to a national
drug policy.
With any hope, Kerlikowske's appoint-
ment will represent a long-overdue shift
in the federal government's drug enforce-
ment policies. Under George W. Bush,
policies focused on punishing drug users.
According to the Washington Post's Mar.
12 article on Kerlikowske, funding for
treatment and prevention decreased by 25
percent during President George W. Bush's
two terms.
But Kerlikowske is expected to imple-
ment a policy that focuses on treatment
and prevention rather than punishment.
He has said that the best way to slow the
flow of drugs like cocaine is to decrease
usage, starting in local communities. The
idea is to target the use of illegal substanc-
es by decreasing demand rather than just
attacking the supply.
Education about drug use is the first
component of a more sensible drug pol-
icy. By informing individuals about the
harmful effects accompanying addictive
substances, the government has the oppor-
tunity to prevent drug use before it leads

to addiction - and potentially crime and
other problems that can go along with it.
And with additional education, individuals
will be better equipped to make decisions
about what they put into their bodies.
The Obama administration is also right
to focus on rehabilitation and treatment
over incarceration. Under the new drug
policy, drug users will have a chance to
serve their sentences in a rehabilitation
center instead of in the already over-
crowded prison system. This makes sense,
considering that drug use isn't a violent
crime and doesn't necessarily present a
threat to others.
Focusing on rehabilitation is also a more
humane approach. Just last week, a police
officer shot an unarmed student in the
chest during a marijuana raid in his resi-
dence hall room at Grand Valley State Uni-
versity.
This sort of event is all the more common
because of drug control policies that have
targeted users rather than dealers. Addic-
tion is a condition that calls for treatment
and prevention - not overzealous enforce-
ment.
Changing national drug policy to reflect
the fact that users need treatment facili-
ties - not police raids - is just one more
way Obama is demonstrating his much
stronger grasp of what constitutes sen-
sible policy.
Maybe his next decision will be to
rename the position to something that
screams "oppressive Russian autocracy" a
little less loudly.

tion is, "Who is this Juras person and
what gives her the right to censor
legitimate newspaper content?"
It may seem like an obvious fact of
life, but Juras's objections signal that
at least some readers didn't get the
message - sex is an important part of
college life, and ignoring it does a dis-
service to students. Ironically, Juras's
stated objection to the column is that it
is not serving an educational purpose
- but that is exactly what sex columns
do. Across the country, sex columns
offer practical safety tips about safe
sex, birth control and reducing the
risks of sexually-transmitted diseases.
To say that a sex column serves no
educational purpose isn't just mislead-
ing - it's flat out wrong.
Oram'sarticle in defense of the sex
column sheds some light on why Juras
would have such passionate objections
to it. He explainedthatshe is amember
of the Christian Legal Society, which
sued the School of Law in 2007 for
denying fundingto the CLS. What was
the School of Law's reason for denying
funding? Well, according to Oram's
story, the CLS "does not allow gay stu-
dents to hold leadership positions or
even grant them voting rights."
Instead of digressing into my argu-
ment for why no group could deny gay
people voting rights and simultane-
ously consider itself "Christian", Iwill
merely take issue with Juras's tactics.
Does she have the right to disapprove
of the column? Absolutely. Is it appro-
priate for her to express her dissat-
isfaction with the Kaimin's editors?
Yes - she is, after all, a reader, and any
responsible editor should listen (and,
when appropriate, respond) to feed-
back from readers. But should she
attempt to bring legal ramifications
upon the Kaimin's staff for not com-
plying with her (absurd) demands?
The answer is an emphatic no.
Just because someone objects to a
newspaper's content doesnotmeanthe
University administration, the Board
of Regents or the state legislature has
authority to step in and influence its
editorial decisions. A student newspa-
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

per is only able to credibly examine its
University administration as long as
it remains independent of the institu-
tions it covers. While banning a sex
column from astudentnewspaper may
seem like a minor issue, any infringe-
ment upon a student newspaper's right
to print the content it deems relevant
to students violates not only the First
Amendment but also the very founda-
tions of ethical journalism.
Student newspapers
should be wary
of censorship.
And what happened at the Kaimin
is by no means an isolated incident.
The staff of the University of Ore-
gon's student newspaper - the Daily
Emerald - went on strike last month
after its Board of Directors appointed
a publisher who had editorial control
over the paper and who had not been
approved by the students. The Board
then went ahead and published its
own version of the paper. The fact
that this could happen to a student
newspaper should only solidify the
need to watch out for even the least
egregious infringements upon edito-
rial freedom.
While the burden of defending print
journalism from unethical intrusions
mostly rests with editors themselves,
students also have a responsibility to
voice their dissatisfaction with dimin-
ished journalistic autonomy. At the
very least, all readers - and students,
especially - should recognize not only
the relevance of sex columns to today's
college students, but also the right for
student newspapers to print them.
And if someone knows what a
kaimin is, I'm all ears.

CAMPUS DEBATES
MSA ELECTIONS 2009

MICHIGAN VISION PARTY g

REMICHIGAN CAMPAIGN I

Changing the assembly's vision

Making student gov't relevant

Most of the attention focused on the Michigan
Student Assembly in recent years has centered on
an election scandal that ended in a felony convic-
tion, a president resigning in disgrace and an appar-
ent transformation into a debate society. Recently,
MSA has debated the conflict in Gaza.
It is hard to take MSA seriously with this record,
so we understand that you may not have been pay-
ing attention.
By any measure, MSA has failed to fulfill its
promises. Every student at this University has great
potential - why hasn't this translated to the stu-
dent government?
In our time at MSA, it has become clear that the
current culture does not recognize that the stu-
dent should hold the government accountable for
its actions. The lack of responsibility and transpar-
ency in an institution that is supposed to repre-
sent the student body has made MSA inaccessible
and unrepresentative. It's not surprising that voter
turnout is so low. Much of MSA's current work does
not merit positive attention and is merely self-in-
dulgent debate to fill the agenda.
With these failures in mind, the Michigan Vision
Party has tried to change the stagnant "business
(or lack thereof) as usual" attitude. If you've been
through the Diag as of late, you may have had some-
one ask you - or seen a T-shirt asking, "What's your
vision?" Rather than resorting to simply handing
out flyers that you will inevitably throw away, we
have urged you to give us something.
Our vision is a student government that addresses
student concerns and is relevant to campus, rather
than a government that recycles old personnel and
talking points. We don't want to be re-elected on a
promise to refocus. We don't want to "re" anything.
Instead, we want to fundamentally change the cul-
ture of MSA. Our vision should be synonymous with
your concerns. This can only be done if students
have a student government that they believe will
listen and representatives that truly understand
student concerns and deliver real results. This is
probably the biggest difference between MVP and

the cadre of students who have managed MAP and
the reMICHIGAN campaign. If elected, MVP will
insist that MSA focus on issues it is capable of han-
dling.
This is not to say that our impact will be small or
limited. MVP wants MSA to work for all students.
We will do this by implementing plans such as a
"How to Get a Job" week of resume preparation,
interview practice and a job fair for all schools, col-
leges and departments. We're committed to making
campus greener by placing recycling bins alongside
every trash can and encour-
aging students to print
double-sided. We would like
to make campus resources
more available by creating a
Student Help Desk that may
not have all the answers On Wedn
but ,can direct students
toward someone who does. students h
We want to contribute to a
campus that can respond elect nev
effectively and holistically Pick ca
to LGBT concerns. We want your
to be vigilant in handling
student safety issues like
sexual assault and domestic _
violence. We will promote
a campus as unified as it is
diverse while sharing ideas, engaging in dialogue
and striving toward our individual and collective
potential.
Our vision has many different aspects and con-
cerns because it is a reflection of the student body.
MSA should be a similar reflection. But this can
only happen when we have an MSA that is account-
able, transparent and at work for students. This is
our vision. We hope that on Wednesday and Thurs-
day, you'll help us realize the student body's poten-
tial by voting for the Michigan Vision Party.

The reMICHIGAN Campaign is the first major
step in refocusing student government. We are a
group of students representing seven schools and
colleges who'are committed to important student
issues.
The reMICHIGAN Campaign is a new idea about
how student government and Michigan Student
Assembly elections should work. A party is about
people but a campaign is about substance, and we
believe that this election has the potential to make
MSA relevant again.
The substan-
tive difference
between the
reMICHIGAN
Campaign and
the parties in this
y and Thursday, electionisthatwe
offer more than
he opportunity to just ideas and a
.1 . vision for student
dership in MSA. government. We
es at vote.umich.edu. offer a complex
eS a V~e~umC . u-and intellectual
approach toward
solving prob-
lems.
We have been
committed to fig-
uring out the "how" for solving the pressing prob-
lems of this campus and we have developed plans
and backup plans to comprehensively attack issues.
Our diverse slate of candidates reflects the talent,
energy, experience and work ethic that MSA needs
to revitalize the way it works.
Led by presidential candidate Gibran Baydoun
and vice-presidential candidate Greg Caplan, the
reMICHIGAN Campaign offers a wealth of expe-
rience, innovation and initiative. Baydoun and
Caplan lead through their persistent commitment
to this university and the Michigan community.
Turning the page on the history of parties in
MSA, the reMICHIGAN Campaign does not have

a laundry list of intangible ideas. We focus on six
major initiatives: tuition and financial aid, career
and internship opportunities, sustainability and
green initiatives, academic guidance, student orga-
nizations and Michigan spirit and tradition. For
each of these initiatives, we have laid out a multi-
faceted approach to tackling each problem, even
starting before Election Day to explore and test dif-
ferent solutions. We are not waiting for the title to
start fighting for students and the issues they care
about.
Put candidly, the University deserves a student
government that works and it can't afford to wait.
Imagine an active student government that serves
as a mobilizing body for students, fighting for their
interests, defending their rights and lobbying on
their behalf. Imagine a persistent student gov-
ernment, one that goes beyond just talking about
student issues and ideas and works continually to
implement multiple plans of action for bettering
campus.
Imagine a collaborative student government,
a government that serves as a union for students,
uniting them and their organizations for collective
action in solving Michigan's problems. Imagine a
student government that tackles issues proactive-
ly and is not afraid to handle real challenges that
affect students.
At the end of the day, we believe in'MSA's poten-
tial to dogreat things and we are certain that if you
trust and support the reMICHIGAN Campaign,
there will be a new day in student government. We
know that when students are engaged and united,
amazing things can happen.
We thank you for the cross-campus support and
ask that you check out our entire slate of candidates
and our detailed platforms at www.reMICHIGAN.

Join us in revitalizing MSA and enhancing the
Michigan experience.

What does'pop' even
mean anymore?

et's be honest: Does any-
one really know what the
hell "pop music" means
anymore? The phrase has been
stretched out, continuously mis-
construed and
applied to such
a scatter plot of
splinter genres
(see: bastard pop,
pop-punk) that,
frankly, its diag-
nostic abilities JOSH
have gone the
way of the dodo. B EI
. When you hear
the word "pop," who or what
springs immediately to mind?
Maybe it's a pin-up of Britney
Spears striking a commercially
viable pose in a skimpy tube top.
Maybe it's Michael Jackson, the
alleged "King of Pop." Maybe it's
Auto-Tune, that remarkable soft-
ware that makes every pop singer's
mediocre voice sound on-pitch.
Regardless, it's likely that the
immediate connotations of "pop"
huddle around the central hub of
popular music (before the term
"pop music" gained genre status,
it was simply used to classify
music with mainstream appeal).
Pop music, in its most basic form,
is often confined to airbrushed
radio darlings including boy bands,
American Idol divas and the Jonas
Brothers.
Still, pop subgenres like indie
pop and avant-pop fly directly in
the face of pop music's historical
roots. The raison d'Ptre driving
both indie music and avant-garde
music is the freedom to deviate
from the sonic norm - the joy in
shucking off the burden of wide-
spread commercial appeal.
But somehow, these countercul-
ture genres have ended up as pre-
fixes in the sub-pop catalogue. Call
me a cynical douche, but it certainly
seems like our country's capitalist
machine finds a way of taking art
that is "against the system" and
integrating it back into the very
system it opposes via oxymoronic
labels. It's like "pop" is the Time
Warner of music, buying up all the
niche genres and throwing them
into the conglomerate meat grinder.

Despite objections, nudity will
always have a place in dance

By TRINA MANNINO
Daily Arts Writer
I've seen my share of eccentric
modern dance works. My experi-
ence as an audience member has
included everything from watching
asoloistdiscussingher fictional love
affair with Ann Coulter while danc-
ing in combat boots to a group of
students running underneath a tarp
screaming at the top of their lungs.
A few weeks ago, I went to
see a performance at Dance New
Amsterdam in New York City, a
venue that's known for presenting
edgy and controversial works. And
until that night, I didn't think many
things could make me blush with
uneasiness.
In the performance, two women
dressed in multiple layers of cloth-
ing began by facing each other on
stage and repeating the other's
words. one of these women was
my former teacher. As the dialogue
progressed, the women's speech
took on a rhythmic pattern and
they began to remove a layer of
clothing after each pause as if they
were losing rounds of strip poker.
Off went their T-shirts, shorts and
bras until they were left only in
their underwear.
My teacher's breasts were out
for the world - including me, her
student - to see. Both women
stared at each other's naked bodies
sheepishly as they realized what
had just transpired. They giggled,
turned to the audience and then
proceeded to re-clothe themselves
in the garments that were strewn
across the floor. As I watched, I
wanted to scream, "But you just
showed your breasts to everyone
and now you're going to act like it
never happened!"
After the performance, I began
to think about nudity in modern
dance and I came to the conclu-
sion that I was making a bigger deal
about the performance than neces-
sary. After all, nudity is in film all
the time. I barely bat an eyelash

yet it has the look and feel of a snuff
film. There are several moments in
which the camera lingers over the
girls a little too 'Tong, objectifying
them and merely turning them into
bodies. Even during the rape scene,
the camera practically invites' the
viewer to ogle the girls rather than
feel repulsed. The movie constantly
borders on being offensive, and it
probably would've been incredibly
so if it weren't so boring. The final
effect is that audience members
are left with a bitter taste in their
mouths, unsure of just who to root
for. Certainly they should be siding
with the parents, but it doesn't help
that the parents' revenge is abso-
lutely devoid of emotion.
The movie might not. be deep,
but that doesn't mean it's not enter-
taining at times. The bad guys get
what's coming to them and the
audience gets gore and some cheap
shocks. In the end, it's a pretty fair
trade, especiallybecausethere's no
preachy message to bog down the
film, unless the message is "Don't
buy weed from strange boys in
convenience stores." And that's
probably a pretty good message for
teenage girls to learn.
This film functions as noth-
ing more than a violent two-hour
escape from reality. After that, it
will be forgotten until someone
decides to remake it again.

ENDOWMENT
From Page 1
In the letter, Baucus and Grass-
ley asked how tax policies, which
exempt endowment funds and
donations to the endowment from
being taxed, have affected the man-
agement and the use of endowment
revenue.
Unlike universities and public
foundations, most private founda-
tions are required to pay out a min-
imum of 5 percent of their assets
each year toward their charitable
missions. At the time the Senate
Finance Committee sent out its
letter, there was much talk about
instituting a similar rule for uni-
versities and public foundations
to make them spend more of their
endowment each year.
THE UNIVERSITY'S
DEFENSE OF CURRENT
SPENDING LEVELS
In response to the Senate
Finance Committee letter, Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man sent a 21-page response to the
Finance Committee in February
2008. In the University's response,
which was submitted by University
President Mary Sue Coleman, she
addressed 11 key points of concern
voiced by Baucus and Grassley.
The response said the Univer-
sity's endowment had grown 382
percent over the past 10 years as
of June 30. At the beginning of
1998, the endowment was valued
at $199 billion, but by the end of
the 2008 fiscal year, the endow-
ment had grown to approximately
$7.6 billion. As of December 31, the
endowment had lost 14.4 percent
of its 2008 value, dropping to $6.5
billion.
On the one hand, the University's
response also said total financial
aid awards from the University's
endowment had more than dou-
bled over roughly the same time
period. In the 1998 - 1999 academic
year, the University contributed
approximately $19.7 million to stu-
dent financial aid through grants
and scholarships. By the 2007-
2008 academic year, that figure had
increased to about $52.2 million.
Studenttuitionrates,onthe other
hand, increased during that same
time period as well from $6,098
per term in the 1998-1999 academic
year to $10,447 in the 2007-2008
academic year.

ings, Harvard University, Yale
University and Dartmouth Col-
lege announced plans to increase
the amount of endowment money
spent on student financial aid. The
University did not make a similar
announcement.
In a January 2009 interview,

good job with supporting students'

internal formula.

ley were suggesting, she did not
agree that it was appropriate for the
government to place payout restric-
tions on colleges and universities.

students of tomorrow suffer. I
couldn't do that."
A CONSERVATIVE PAYOUT
Since University leaders don't
think it's appropriate for govern-
ment officials to interfere in deter-
mining the annual payout of the
endowment, the question then
becomes how exactlythe amount of
that payout is decided.
University Chief Investment
Officer Erik Lundberg said the
University uses a seven-year
rolling average to help protect
endowed funds, including those
endowed for scholarships, from
temporary swings of the market.
"We want to insulate the oper-
ations of the University -from
the volatility in the market," he
said, "and the way we do that is
through the averaging process."
Lundberg explained that by
taking the past 28 quarters of
endowment performance bal-
ances, which accounts for the
past seven years, and updating
them each quarter by replacing
the oldest quarter with the new-
est, the University is able to aver-
age its funds over. a long period
of time to stabilize market per-
formance that would otherwise
be unstable.
"By taking the value of the
endowment at multiple peri-
ods of time rather than at just
one, we get a much more stable
value," he said.
Lundberg said payouts from
the endowment are treated the
same for all endowed funds, and
that a formula determines the
annual payout. The payout is 5
Percent annualized over market
average, Lundberg said. This
means that 1.25 percent of earn-
ings on investments as calculat-
ed by the seven-year average are
dispersed from the endowment
each fiscal quarter. By doing this,
the four quarters of payouts will
result in a 5 percent annualized
payout.
INCREASING THE
ENDOWMENT, INCREASING
THE PAYOUT
Despite the recent volatil-
ity in the markets, the University's
recently finished fundraising cam-
paign - the Michigan Difference
- raised an unprecedented $3.2
billion from the time the campaign
went public in 2004.
Through the campaign, approxi-
mately $545 million were raised for
newly endowed scholarship funds.
As of the 2008 fiscal year, the new
funds have generated $10 million in
student support.
"Duringthe Michigan Difference

campaign, donors created 2,045
newendowedfunds for financialaid
in addition to providing expendable
funds for scholarships," University
spokeswoman Kelly Cunningham
wrote in an e-mail.
Despite the University's success-
ful Michigan Difference campaign,
Coleman said in the January 2009
interview that the University will
likely start another capital cam-
paign in the near future.
"(This) doesn't mean we stop
fundraising," she said. "There'll be
another campaign in a few years."
Coleman said private fundrais-
ing efforts are essential to the Uni-
versity's success and contribute to a
successful, growing endowment.
"We'll start another capital
campaign because getting that
philanthropic support is critical to
keeping the University at the high
level that it is," she said.
Coleman said that although the
University places a large emphasis
on fund development for student
support, it is often the donors who
ultimately decide for what their
donations should be used.
"Now a lot of (our fund develop-
ment) isdependent on what donors
want," she said. "Fortunately, in the
capital campaign that we just fin-
ished, we had put a huge emphasis
on financial aid."
Of the Michigan Difference cam-
paign's final fundraising total, Cole-
man said the University "got way
over our targets on the money we
had wanted to raise f'or financial
aid."
NEW DONATIONS CAN
CREATE NEW RESTRICTIONS
When a donor gives money to the
University, that person often has an
intended use in mind for that dona-
tion.
A donor interested in giving a
large gift to the University must
first enter into a gift agreement
with the University, said Gordon
Beeman, a University assistant gen-
eral counsel.
"The purpose of the gift agree-
ment is to document the purpose,
restriction and intended use of the
donor's gift .. so that there is no
confusion or ambiguity at a later
time," he said.
Beeman said the gift agreement
also outlines that the donor's gift
will be subject to the University's
bylaws and policies and establishes
a payment schedule for the gift. Pay-
ment schedules are used to outline
how much donors will give over
what period of time, if they choose
not to donate the gift all at once.
More importantly, Beeman said
donors typically have a specific
purpose in mind for their gift.
"Certainly with larger gifts, the

donors typically have a specific
purpose in mind," he said. "Obvi-
ously so long as it's furthering the
University's mission, we're delight-
ed to document and apply the gift
funds in that way."
Outlining the purpose of the
gift can be more involved than it
sounds, as it is sometimes the case
that a gift may need secondary
specifications, if the primary need
cannot be met.
Beeman used a scholarship
fund at the School of Education to
explain why a secondary purpose
may be needed.
"The real purpose (of the gift)
was to benefit students from her
particular county, which is located
in central Illinois," he said, point-
ing out that it is very likely that at
any given year a student from that
county may not be enrolled in the
School of Education.
There is a tiered policy so stu-
dents from Illinois get the next pri-
ority, he said. Then, if no one from
Illinois qualifies for the scholarship,
then the studentbody at large in the
School of Education is eligible for
the scholarship, he said.
Additionally, a donor could also
specify a gift for cancer research,
but may put a secondary purpose in
the gift agreement in case a cure for
cancer is found, so that the money
does not go to waste, Beeman said.
Although donors can specify
some purposes or restrictions on
their gift, there are certain things
the University is not legally allowed
to distinguish, Beeman said.
"The University of course is sub-
ject to both federal and state law,"
he said. "As such we cannot dis-
criminate based on race or gender,
and we don't."
However, Beeman mentioned
a certain concept - the matching
pool concept - that does allow a
donor to specify some criteria indi-
rectly. Beeman used the example of
a donor wanting to benefit a certain
gender to illustrate the concept.
"It's possible for the Univer-
sity to go through its financial
aid process, determine the recipi-
ents - which of course would be
in my example would be male and
female - and then from that pool
match the donor's gift to someone
who is the gender the donor spec-
ified," he said. "So in that sense,
we can accommodate a donor
request."
Beeman said it would also be
possible for a donor who wanted to
benefit underprivileged students to
specify a preference for students
from an inner city for a scholar-
ship.
"In that way we're not selecting
based on an impermissible class
and yet we may capture what the
donor truly has in mind," he said.

ment support.
"We always felt like we were
pretty exemplary when it came to
both the payout that we did and
the amount of money we had com-
mitted to financial aid," she said. "I
understand the Grassley criticism,
but I think the University of Michi-
gan was already in a position where
we were doing extremely well."
According to the University's
response last year to the Senate

She explained that if the University
were to provide a larger amount of
financial aid to current students,
then students in the future would
likely suffer.
"What we objected to is the
notion that some government-run
agency should dictate what we do,"
she said. "We've got to plan forever,
and I didn't agree that it was appro-
priate to somehow spend down our
endowment for the today to make

www.theislandhouse.com vice presidential candidates debut-

ed for about half an hour.
Because not all representative
candidates were able to debate,
packetswere distributedtotheaudi-
ence outlining the platforms of each
representative running for MSA.
Among other questions, Page
asked the vice presidential candi-
dates whatdistinguishedeachparty
from the others, what their primary
goals as vice president would be if
elected and how strong they think
their party's slate of candidates is.
Rorro said MVP's emphasis on
quality rather than quantity when
choosing candidates. makes it
unique from other parties. He also
said the party's commitment to.
making MSA more transparent and
accountable makes it different.
"I think that our party is distin-
guished specifically because of the
goals we set out to accomplish from
the beginning," he said. "The way
we're approaching student govern-
ment is different from the way any-
one hasin the past."
DAAP's Owagbemi said she
would want to make herself and her
party more available to students
than other parties.
"I see myself being an aid for stu-
dents," she said. "I want students to
actually be able to come to me and
to know that I'm listening and that
our party is actually listening to
everything they are saying."

Caplan said the diversity of
reMichigan's candidates makes its
slate especially strong.
"Every (reMichigan candidate)
that I have spent time with on this
campaign, which is all of them,
have truly impressed me," he said.
"They come from all parts of this
campus; they are the most diverse
group of people I've ever done any-
thing with."
After the event, Election Direc-
tor Emily Winter, an LSA junior,
said she thought the debate went
well.
"I think the candidates did a
really great job. They answered the
questions. They touched on a lot of
issues, a very broad range of top-
ics," she said. "And I think they did
a good job of answering the ques-
tions fully and giving their honest
opinions."
MSA Vice President Arvind
Sohoni said he thought the debate
was positive for MSA, but that he
wished more students not involved
in student government had attend-
ed. He also said the debate was not
as heated as he expected.
"I wish we had more students at
large; you know, naturally you have
a lot of candidates show up,"he said.
"And it's great; everyone did pretty
well. I expected some fireworks,
but we didn't really get a whole lot
of those."

Blue-collar mentality drives Novak's success FOR IC HOCY

Everyone could see the blood
Illinois's Alex Legion had just
elbowed Novak above his left eye
while the two battled for arebound
midway through the second half
at Crisler Arena on Jan. 4. Novak,
leavingbehind a trail of blood, was
escorted to the Michigan dressing
room, while holding a towel to a
gash above his left eye. His return
to the game looked doubtful.
But Novak has never been the
type of player to let anything get
in his way. And he wasn't about to
start.
Six stitches later, Novak reen-
tered the game with just over five
minutes remaining in regulation.
He simply wasn't going to miss
the rest of the game.
"That wasn't even an option,"
Novak said. "I just went in and
said, 'Stitch it up as fast as you can,
and here I go."'
YOUNG AND OUTSIZED
Likemostsecondgraders,Novak
enjoyed playing sports in the park.
But he his playmates were a little
larger than most.
An only child, the Chesterton,
Ind. native filled his summers
going to Hawthorne Park, within
walking distance of his childhood
home. He played all sports with
his neighbors and friends: basket-
ball, football, baseball and soccer.
But in second and third grade,
some other friends joined on the
basketball court.
Local high schoolers asked
Novak to fill an extra spot to play.
"I was small," Novak said. "I
just remember there were guys
who would be dunking."
His mom, Dana, a teacher at
Chesterton High School and for-
mer high school basketball player,
knew the boys from school and
trusted they would take good care
of her son.
Once, Novak side-planted on
the gravel during a game. Instead
of laughing and teasing him, one
of the boys drove him home on his
moped.
He's now a 6-foot-5 guard but
often asked to guard players three
or four inches taller like Michigan
State forward Delvon Roe or Illi-
nois forward Mike Davis.
In last Friday's Big Ten Tourna-
ment quarterfinal loss to Illinois,
Davis used his four-inch advan-
tage to score 22 points and grab 10
rebounds. But Novak scrapped for
seven boards of his own, including
three on the offensive end.
It's impossible to grow four or
five inches and gain 20 pounds. But
Novak has learned how to even the
playing field.
TOUGH LOVE
As the coach of the local fourth
grade Amateur Athletic Union
basketball team, Novak's father
Dave barely taught offense. In fact,
his teams ran just one set play. The
rest was hustle, aggressiveness and
defense.
Novak's father, who played one
year of varsitybasketball at Purdue-
Calumet, coached Novak and some
of his future high school teammates
a little differently than most AAU
coaches.Dave said heetaught defense
up 70 percent of their practices.
"He didn't get mad about missing
shots or not shooting the ball like a
lot of dads do," Novak said. "He was

just (mad) if you didn't dive, didn't
take a charge, not playing help-side
defense."
Dave's methods worked. His
teams won three consecutive AAU
Indiana state championships after
fourth grade.
When those boys began playing
for their grade-school teams, Dave
recalled that Novak's new coach
was very impressed.
"Coach asked me, 'How did you
get them to play defense like that?

We can't get any other team to do
it,' " Dave said. "By that point, it
was all they knew. I don't know if
you can flip a switch on them."
What if Dave's players didn't
play tough defense?
"Besides getting screamed out ...
it would scare us a little bit," Novak
said. "Other than that, he'd prob-
ably just take us out of the game."
Around the same time, Novak
attended former Indiana coach
Bob Knight's summer basketball
camps. Knight, affectionately
known as 'The General,' was a god
to manybasketball-obsessed locals
during his 29 seasons in Blooming-
ton. Known for his blatant tough-
ness and demanding style, Knight
is a hero to some and a nightmare
to others.
WHO WAS TOUGHER?
"I'd say on a consistent basis,
I'd have to go with the General,"
Novak said. "My dad came very
close to Bobby Knight's status
with me a few times. I'm going to
have to go with a draw most of the
time, but I think sometimes, my
dad, he came close."
Dave now makes the three-hour
drive from Chesterton to attend
many of Michigan's home games.
He's not at all surprised to see

Novak scrimmaged with Peller's
senior-laden squad.
It didn't take long for the juniors
and seniors to see Novak's poten-
tial.
"They respected him right from
the get-go," Peller said. "It wasn't
like 'Oh, here's an eighth grader.'
They heard about him, but once
they saw how hard he played - he
was diving on the floor, hustling,
he was getting rebounds."
Novak earned a starting spot his
freshman year and stayed there
until his final game as a senior. He
left as Chesterton's all-time lead-
ing scorer, breaking the 55-year-
old record.
"If there was a bad play that
he made the mistake, instead of
whining, he would just play harder
and better," Peller said. "So many
kids nowadays, say 'oh it's my
fault' or they blame the ref or pout.
He would just jack it up another
notch."
During those four years, his
competitive edge was well-known,
but his future was uncertain.
After Novak averaged nearly 16
points per game during his fresh-
man season, Division-I Valparaiso,
just 10 minutes from Chesterton,
offered him a full scholarship.
Since his childhood, Novak

es didn't know what to

"He was a hell of a
baseball player," Adams
said with a laugh."If I was
going to tell him to concen-
trate on something, it might
have been baseball."
Playing collegiate baseball
crossed Novak's mind, but
offers were not on the table.
And his heart just wasn't in it.
But he wasn't about to com-
plain.
Novak entered his senior year at
Chesterton without a clear future
- no scholarship offers and no
definite answers.
"I said, 'I know you love basket-
ball, but you have to look out
for what's going to be best for
you,' and he didn't want to
hear any part of that," Dave
said. "He justtold me,'I'mgoing
to have a great senior year.'"
To add insult to injury, after
being named to two local news-
papers' top-five players lists after NO

both preseason All-Area top-five HOME'
lists.
But instead of getting angry,
complaining or playing selfishly, HEIGH
Novak just wanted to get better.

ball, and Novak said he credits his
toughness to Dave's teaching and
coaching.
"Mainly the hustle plays, the
loose balls, never giving up on the
rebound, keep going after it, keep

Dave said. "Other than that, I
didn't teach him a lot of the ath-
letic, skill part of the game."
Those skills helped him move
on to the next level.

team capped a perfect 23-0 season,

Around the time Novak was
makinghis decision, a local colum-
nist suggested he should choose
Valparaiso.
The columnist at the Indiana
Post-Tribune was clear: "Novak
could be The Man at VU. He'd be
just another freshman at Michi-
gan, scratching and clawing for
his chance."
At Michigan, Novak has
scratched and clawed for loose
balls and rebounds.
But he has been more than "just
another freshman".
PROVING HISWORTH
Against Minnesota on March 7,
the Wolverines were just 101 sec-
onds from a win that many thought
would seal their place in their first
NCAA Tournament in 11 years.
Down five, the Golden Gophers
put up a 3-pointer and Novak went
after the long bounce at the top of
the key. His feet landed firmly'on
the court and his hands securely
on the ball. Michigan retained its
lead.
Everyone notices his sharp
shooting, but little plays like this
have made just as much of a con-
tribution.
Last season, Beilein's team
often looked lethargic in games.
The Wolverines frequently had
lengthy scoring droughts, and
players got down on themselves
en route to a program-record 22
losses.
But his refusal to let in games
up is.palpable. In last Thursday's
60-50 loss to Illinois, the Wol-
verines trailed by 20 points and
a blowout seemed inevitable. An
embarrassing loss on the Big Ten
Tournament stage could have
hindered their NCAA Tourna-

ment hopes.
. Novak responded with five
straight points and a few crucial
rebounds that led to a 13-2 late
Michigan run.
"He's just exactly what the doc-
tor ordered as far as a guy who is
just a nuts and bolts, blue-collar,
lunch bucket, whatever you guys
want to call him," Beilein said. "He
just does a lot of the garbage stuff
that we need to get done."
Novak does it without a lot of
media recognition, but his team-
mates certainly notice his intensity.
"If he doesn't get a number or
reach his goal of what he's trying
to do, he gets upset," sophomore
forward Manny Harris said. "He's
just tough on himself because it's
important to him, he knows he
supposed to do it.
"I can't pinpoint it. It's not a
frustration where it's an angry,
go crazy. He's just mad at himself,
and you can see it in his face some-
times."
Novak will turn 19 in May. He's
still younger than many freshman
basketball players when they enter
college. Despite his age, coaches
see that he expects perfection
from himself.
"He gives us a level of tough-
ness," Jackson said. "Toughness
varies in different guys. I just
think he has a passion about how
he plays everything and it doesn't
change. It's consistent, and he's
willing to do whatever it takes."
In less than a year, he has prov-
en to his coaches and teammates
that he won't give up. He's never
satisfied with the status quo - he's
always focused- on pushing him-
self.
He might have gotten the schol-
arship at the big school, but he
hasn't forgotten the work ethic
that got him there.
"I'm just competitive," Novak
said. "I want to win at everything.
That's always been the biggest
thing with me. It doesn't matter
if I'm playing in the YMCA where
there's nobody there or playing
(at Crisler Arena) where there's
14,000 people in the crowd. I don't
want to get beat."
