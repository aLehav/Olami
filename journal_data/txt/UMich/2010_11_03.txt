PERSONALSTATEMENT

COPING WITH TRAUM
BANA CM NGE MYLi
BY ANNA CLEMENTS

have a mental disability. I acquired
it four years ago in a car crash. It's
a big deal.
I could tell you the story of the
crash, describe my 40-day hospital
experience (only two weeks of which
I remember) or the lengthy rehab that
followed. I could describe the experi-
ence of re-entering life and school with
a traumatic brain injury, of adjusting to
being on the other side of the spectrum
in school - from advanced to remedi-
al - and of the gains and losses I had
because of the injury.
I could talk about how slim my
chances were of even surviving, let
alone being able to function as a normal
human being. I could talk about how a
combination of my willpower and the
love and help I received from others has
gotten me this far.
That story would likely touch your
heart; more religious people have seen
my story as proof that there is a higher
power that loves and forgives us and
wants us to survive - something I

people are too polite to react to.
Sometimes I think that acquiring
the disability has made me into a more
balanced, focused person. I have medi-
cal evidence to reinforce and identify
my struggles, and sometimes I think
it must be difficult not having doctors
around to tell you what your cognitive
problems are. I don't want to be "nor-
mal," but I do want my differences to
be understood. I think that's how many
people feel, regardless of race, gender,
eye color, favorite type of music or dis-
.ability.
The moral of the story: drive safely.
Be nice to the students who mistakenly
walk into your lecture halfway through
- they might have a disability. And
don't be shocked when "normal" people
disclose personal information identify-
ing them as different.
I can't speak for the entire disabled
community; we all have our own prob-
lems, including non-disabled students.
It's just harder for those of us with dis-
abilities to talk about certain problems;
some issues require long explanations
with lengthy background stories to be
properly understood.

BIPARTISANSHIP
From Page 5B
studying the sidewalk chalk grac-
ing the Diag, there are still pro-life
messages among the student-group
advertisements, College Republican
fliers are taped to the cement post-
ing cylinders and students have been
knocking on doors campaigning for
Rick Snyder.
"There are definitely conservative
people here," Janisse said. "It seems
like everyone at least is pretty sensible
about why they hold the views that
they hold, and besides some people
shouting out on the Diag occasion-
ally, it seems like people are at least
respectful, even if they disagree."
Koziara says that people are mostly
just curious when finding out he's a
Republican.
"You get a lot of looks for wearing
a Michigan Republicans shirt around
campus, more so disbelief than any-
thing else," he said.. "There's a little
bit of prejudice here and there. I
think that happens both ways, pri-
marily directed at Republicans
because this is a college campus.
There's a lot more people who are
willing nowadays, I think, to engage
in conversation about it when they

find out I'm a Republican ... which I
think is really great, because they're
open to new ideas."
Still, Bertrand recognizes the lack
of compromise and productive dis-
course in the government and under-
stands that it could create larger
issues for Michigan residents if the
legislators don't start working togeth-
er for their constituents.
"We're very divided. If you look at
the Michigan state legislators, it's a
complete deadlock and nothing gets
done becauwse of it," she said. "That
might be something Stewart was try-
ing to foreshadow. Just saying, 'Look
at what's going to happen."'
The turnout at the rally shows that
there's a large population frustrated
by this division between liberals and
conservatives. Still, this protest was
surprisingly patriotic. There was
no doubt of- the participants' love of
America. They just want their country
to work properly.
"We're not the America that the
media portrays us to be," Janisse said.
"Even though it seems like we all dis-
agree on alot of things, there's no rea-
son we can't compromise to get things
done, because we do it every day in
small situations and large."

random student interview by will grundler

elcome to the Random
Student Interview, an
exercise in existential-
ism in which the solution is always
undefined. Please state your name
and class standing for the record.
Lauren, and I'm a junior.
Why do you think most women fail
to shave their upper lip?
Because they don't havea razor. Or the
hair to do so.
But women do have a micro-mus-
tache that is especially apparent in
harsh sunlight, correct?
But it's peach fuzz. It doesn't count.
Right?
Wrong.In what situation, ifany, is it
acceptable to ask a woman to shave
the peach fuzz?
You have to be dating for at least three
days.
Do you believe in diversity?
Yes.
Have you ever joined in on one of
those ethnic dance groups that
practice late at night in Angell?
No.
Are you sure you believe in diver-
sity?
I've watched them and applauded
them and admired their moves. Does
that count?
Not at all. How much sexual harass-
ment is too much sexual harass-

ment?
On a scale of one to ten? Seven.
What would be a six on your
scale?
Any sexual harassment is inappropri-
ate.
What kind of first name makes you
not want to date a person who is
otherwise exemplary in looks and
personality?
Just their name?
Such as Harold, Pubert, Earnest -
Earnest is okay, because Hemingway
is cool. Mmm (thinking), I'm going to
go Milford.
Are you going to vote for the nerd or
the guy with the funny name?
The nerd.
Is that how you characterize him?
Well, no, but you did it.
You could have said Rick Snyder.
Nerds make better lovers.
Do you want the governor to be a
good lover or do you want him to
make love to the economy, so to
speak?
Only to his wife and the economy.
Do you picture God as a white man
orjust a man?
I don't picture him having gender.
But youjust said "him."
No, I said, "em," like "them," you
know?
Oh, so you're a polytheist?

No, no, I'm just clarifying.
What happens after we die?
It depends. Me, I'm going to heaven.
You, since you're playing mind games
with me, I'm going to throw you in
purgatory.
Do you think many serious discus-
sions among people our age break
down into absurd jokes because of
nihilism or the desperation to be
funny or both?
Both, because it depends on -
Let me stop you right there. What
did one plate say to the other?
I have no idea.
"Lunch is on me." Do you think
people who participate in No Shave
November should be honored or
high-fived or both?
Depends if they can pull it off.
What about me? I actually stopped
shaving in August, but I'm going to
continue not shaving throughout
this month.
I think so far you're handling it well.
So far so good.
80's music:great or the greatest?
Great.
How important is personality when
choosing to hook up with someone?
Probably not at all.
We've heard a lot about gay mar-
riage, but what about bisexual mar-
riage?

Can you marry a person from each
sex? I think that would be illegal.
But should it be illegal?
No.
Interesting. What was the dumbest
Halloween costume you saw?
There were too many "Jersey Shore"
people.
Do you think people who go to the
University of Michigan should
watch such trashy TV?
Yes. We need a break from our curric-
ulum, which is too difficult. We need
to watch someone just completely
ridiculous to be, like, "Wow, because I
go to the University of Michigan I will
not end up like that."
Many people think that what with
the snow and the voting, November
is the absolute worst month. Please
share your most painful memory of
November.
This conversation.
Who is Jake Smilovitz?
(Silence.)
He's the editor in chief of the Daily.
How many times have you read the
Daily?
Zero. No...once! Orientation, freshman
year.
Do you know where to find it?
Oh, it's everywhere. Or in the garbage.

A report published by The University of
North Carolina during Prohibition found that
30 of 34 surveyed college newspaper editors
favored the repeal of Prohibition, according
to an article that appeared in The Michigan
Daily on Feb. 16, 1932.
Many students - particularly members of
fraternities - tried to find ways around Pro-
hibition to maintain their alcohol-induced
fun, purchasing alcohol from bootleggers on
the black market, Tobin said.
"Michigan was a big place like that because
we are so close to Canada, where people
smuggled alcohol across the Detroit River," he
said. "There would be bootleggers who would
get in touch with fraternities and guys living
in boarding houses. Or it would be in the other
direction."
One such story is that of The Great Raid of
1931.
According to Tobin, on the evening of
Wednesday, Feb. 11, 1931, Ann Arbor police-
men raided fraternities suspected of storing
illegal alcohol. The raid occurred just after
final exams and students were getting ready
to celebrate J-Hop - a three-day, non-stop
party tradition at the University.
The brothers of Phi Kappa Sigma were
warned of the raid, Tobin explained, and
were able to quickly hide their stash of alcohol
before the police came to their door.
Edmund Love, a Phi Kappa Sigma pledge
at the time, later recounted the ordeal in his
memoir "Hanging On, or, How to get Through
a Depression and Enjoy Life." Love wrote that
the fraternity members hid 37 quarts of whis-
key and gin, five bottles of champagne, two
cases of beer, four quarts of wine and one jug
of hard cider before the policemen entered
the premises.
According to Love, the police confiscated
about 75 quarts of alcohol that night, and five
fraternity houses were closed for the remain-
der of the school year.

Ruthven was pleased with the results of the
raid, though then Ann Arbor Mayor Edward
Staebler found the punishment quite harsh,
according to Tobin.
According to a Daily article from Feb. 21,
1931, the members of the closed fraternities
"tramped the streets seeking rooming houses
and moving their belongings to new quar-
ters."
In a letter to the editor that appeared in the
Daily the day before that, a student with the
pen name R.W.L. proclaimed that the raids
were a violation of students' rights.
"That since liquor could have been found
in practically every fraternity and rooming
house, in the homes of many faculty members,
in the residence of a vast number of towns-
people, therefore these raids show unfair dis-
crimination," the student wrote.
"That such raids can have no good influ-
ence, for drinking will continue, if not in fra-
ternity houses, then in many other places and
in a more public way," the student continued.
The 1931 night editor of the Daily agreed,
saying in a Feb. 27 editorial that the raids were
not progressive, but rather demonstrated the
lack of respect the city had for the University.
"If these liquor raids have disclosed any
result, it is the lack of proper harmony and
cooperation between the University and Ann
Arbor authorities," he wrote.
The alcohol that was confiscated from Ann
Arbor bootleggers and other citizens guilty of
possession was turned over to the University
Hospital.
The Eighteenth Amendment was repealed
with the adoption of the Twenty-First
Amendment on Dec. 5, 1933, and the Prohibi-
tion era had come to an end. Michigan voters
had approved the repeal of the state's ban the
year prior.
Though students could now drink openly,
the dry line remained in effect until 1969,
according to the Downtown Ann Arbor His-
torical Street Exhibit Program's website.

By MALLORY BEBERMAN
ven before Prohibition was
enacted in Michigan in i918
and ratified at the federal level
less than a year later, University
of Michigan students were limited
in where they could and could not
drink alcohol.
According to James Tobin, a his-
torian who has written extensively
about the history of the University,
Division Street in downtown Ann
Arbor was once more than just
another street. In 1856, in response
to a student riot at Hangsterfer's

Hall on the corner of Main Street
and Washington Street, city officials
established a "dry line" along Divi-
sion Street - which already had that
name - that prohibited saloons east
of there from serving alcohol.
The riot erupted after Hangster-
fer's refused to serve alcohol to two
rowdy University students. Students
stormed into the saloon the next
evening, slashing open beer kegs and
driving the saloon owner into the
streets, according to Tobin.
The dry line, Tobin said, was
"some sort of gentleman's hand-
shake agreement between bar own-

ers and city officials."
He added that this agreement
appeased Ann Arbor residents,
saloon owners and University offi-
cials alike.
"The University officials would
have said, 'Look we don't want these
students to be able to roll out of bed
and go into a bar. We want there to
be some sort of buffer zone between
the campus and the saloons,' " he
speculated.
But even prior to Prohibition, stu-
dents publicly demonstrated their
opposition toward it as it gained
popularity in the country. Accord-

ing to the Downtown Ann Arbor
Historical Street Exhibit Program's
website, University students orga-
nized a rally on State Street in 1902
to demonstrate against the preach-
ing of Carrie Nation - a temperance
movement leader.
In 1903, the dry line went from a
"gentleman's agreement" to actual
law when the Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil voted to make it permanent. But
come 1918, when the state of Michi-
gan enacted Prohibition, the dry line'
would be the least of student's wor-
ries.t
Students at the time reacted simi-

larly to how one might expect them
to react today.
"I think students were accus-
tomed to drinking and there was a
fair amount of alarm and outrage
about Prohibition," Tobin said.
"People were immediately thinking
about ways to get around it."
on the other hand, Tobin said that
University faculty tended to support
Prohibition.
"Some of the faculty were clergy-
men so they had typical conservative
Christian views about drinking,"
he said. "So they were in favor, as a
body, of Prohibition."

D ating is a typical part of college life, but without the proper preparation, dates can
seriously weigh down your wallet. So, before you go on your next date, here are a
couple ways to avoid dropping too much cash for a nice date.
Before it gets too cold out, take advantage of the scenic sites around campus. A
stroll around Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum can be very roman-
tic. And, most importantly, it's free. As for other (indoor) pre-dinner entertainment,
consider going out for drinks and appetizers in places with specials. Bar Louie offers
Happy Hour on weekdays with inexpensive drinks and half priced appetizers. Then,
consider eating dinner somewhere that has specials too, like Sava's dollar burger
nights on Mondays.
Finally, instead of shelling out upwards of $10 a person on movie tickets, consider
renting a'movie from Askwith Media Library. It's free, and watching a movie at home is
way cozier than going to a theater.

wasn't as political as others that have
taken place on the National Mall. The
rally wasn't a call for action. Stewart
asked for nothing, telling his audi-
ence, "If you want to know why I'm
here and what I want from you, I can
only assure you this: you have already
given it to me. Your presence was what
I wanted."
Ultimately, Stewart emphasized the
importance of bi-partisanship.
"Most Americans don't live their
lives solely as Democrats, Republi-
cans, liberals or conservatives," he
told the crowd. "Americans live their
lives more as people that are just a lit-
tle bit late for something they have to
do, often something that they do not
want to do, but they do it - impossible
things every day that are only made
possible by the little reasonable com-
promises that we all make."

f

ASHINGTON - Last Sat-
urday, 422 miles from cam-
pus, Wolverines gathered
on the National Mall in Washing-
ton, D.C. in support of moderacy and
rationality in national politics. Later
reports by CBS News would estimate
the crowd at 215,000, but the amica-
ble atmosphere made the event seem
much smaller. The first time the mass
erupted into cheers, the front section
turned around when their yells sub-
sided. They could hear the reverbera-
tion of people blocks away, who were
so far back that it took longer for sound
to reach them - and at that point we
all knew this was much bigger than we
had anticipated.
Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert's
Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear
illustrates a national desire for mod-
eracy. American politics are afflicted
by a partisan chasm, where those with
different opinions are viewed as ene-
mies, creating a gridlock that makes it
impossible to move forward in discus-
sions of political beliefs. The national
media fuels this divide with pundits,
sorting everyone and anyone into two
distinct categories: liberal and con-
servative. But from John Stewart and
Stephen Colbert's rally in Washington
to students campaigning in Ann Arbor,
there is clearly a movement toward the
middle in American politics.
A MODERATE RALLY
An impromptu protest near the
Fox News van parked beside the mall

was representative of the animosity
toward the national media. Stewart
and Colbert rolled montages on jum-
bo-screens of the titans of punditry
- including Glenn Beck, Keith Olber-
mannand Bill O'Reilly- makinggross
overstatements and apocalyptic politi-
cal predictions. While the crowd was
armed with signs mocking conserva-
tives like Beck, Sarah Palin and other
Fox News personalities, Colbert was
quick to remind those present of the
liberal media's fixation on disaster by
giving an award to Anderson Cooper's
tight black t-shirt for inciting fear dur-
ing every broadcast.
Though the majority of the rally
echoed the comedy seen on "The Daily
Show" and "The Colbert Report,"
Stewart took the last few minutes
of the rally to highlight the media's
shortcomings.
"The country's 24-hour, political
pundit perpetual panic conflictina-
tor did not cause our problems, but
its existence makes solving them that
much harder," he told the crowd. "The
press can hold its magnifying glass up
to our problems, bringing them into
focus, illuminating issues heretofore
unseen. Or they can c"se that magnify-
ing glass to light ants on fire, and then
perhaps host a week of shows on the
dangerous, unexpected flaming ant
epidemic.
"If we amplify everything, we hear
nothing."
This message incited cheers from
throughout the mall. One supporter

was Public Policy junior Tommy Held,
one of the many University students
who made the trek to hear Colbert and
Stewart's message.
"I've been a long-time fan of Jon
Stewart," Held said while preparing
for his trip to the rally. "This is sort of
the nexus of my interest in politics, my
interest in comedy and satire and sort
of what the rally's all about: toning it
down."
There was a clear University pres-
ence in the diverse crowd. Stewart
noted that the audience was a perfect
sampling of the American popula-
tion, with people of all ages, races and
religions within which an occasion-
al representation of maize and blue
stood out among the mass. A man in
a Michigan baseball cap stood in the
packed crowd a dozen yards away, a
girl donning a Michigan flag as a cape
crossed streets a block away and a man
in a Michigan hoodie passed by on the
metro escalator.
LSA senior Christina Bertrand and
seven of her friends made the trip to
Washington last weekend, but it was
much rougher than they had antici-
pated. Their plans for lodging fell
through, they received only a few
hours of sleep and fought dehydration.
Still, Bertrand insists that "the rally
made everything worth it." And that
positive attitude was seen throughout
the National Mall during Stewart and
Colbert's rally, which was packed, yet
still full of polite and courteous par-
ticipants.

The weather was unexpectedly
warm so a man modified his sign from
a political message to "Does anyone
have any sun block?" and moments
later I was passing a bottle in his direc-
tion. After the rally, the crowd was
tired and hungry, but we made way for
a man with a stroller to leave first. The
lines for hot dog vendors were long
and food was in short supply, but when
I joined the line, the couple in front of
me gently told me there were no pret-
zels or water left.
"I was really happy that everyone at
the rally seemed to be really friendly
and respectful," said LSA junior James
Janisse. "I mean, it was ridiculously
packed. You couldn't even move ...
"he country' S24-hour, pc
pe rpetua l pa ni Cconfl iCtin a
cause our problems, but it'
makes solving them that rr
but no one ever yelled or got mad. If
I stepped on someone's foot, I apolo-
gized and they didn't care. It was such
a good atmosphere justbecause I think
we were all there for the same reason."
Janisse believed so much in Stewart
and Colbert's cause that he actually
organized one of many charter buses
that brought people to the rally. He
had been following the rally before its

announcement when it originated on
the Internet. Members of the social
news website Reddit had requested
that Stewart and Colbert host a rally.
According to Janisse, "They started
a donation to a charity to show them
how serious they were and actu-
ally raised over $200,000, and after
that (Stewart and Colbert) started
the whole 'we're going to have an
announcement' thing."
"I was going to drive down there or
fly down there and then on Reddit I
saw they had a board set up for people
wanting to carpool down there," he
said. "I saw someone had the idea for a
charter bus and I was originally going
to get on that one, but I figured I could
just put my own
together."
lItical The week
before the rally,
tor did not Janisse had
52 people con-
's eXIStence firmed to his
bus, only seven
uch hard er.' of whom he
knew prior to
the rally.
Many students, like Bertrand,
couldn't pass this opportunity up.
"I was just able to go," Bertrand said.
"Some of my friends wanted to and my
parents let me borrow their van to lug
everyone around. I just really wanted
to go because I love John Stewart."
With comedic interludes and musi-
cal guests including Kid Rock, Ozzie
Osborne and Yusef Islam, the rally

A MOVEMENT TO
THE MIDDLE?
Stewart and Colbert's rally repre-
sents a trend among voters. Accord-
ing to a September study from the Pew
Research Center, Independents are the
largest group of voters in this election,
claiming 37 percent of registered vot-
ers. This represents one of the largest
groups of Independents in the past 20
years, and is is up from 34 percent two
years ago.
The study also pointed to
the fact that more than
half of current Indepen-
dents used to identify
with a political party at
some point in the past
five years. Twenty-three
percent have identified
as Democrat, 22 percent
as Republican and nine
percent as both.
Recent studies have
also shown a growing
shift in political iden-
tification among young
voters. According to an
October study by the Pew
Research Center, 56 per-
cent of voters under the
age of 30 identify with the
Democratic party, down
from 62 percent in 2008,
while 36 percent identify
as Republican up 6 percent
since 2008.
The rally's effects on the
midterm elections have
been the subject of debate
ever since its announce-
ment. Assistant professor
of organizational stud-
ies and political science
Michael Heaney and
Georgetown doctoral
candidate in government
Andrea Mayer surveyed
325 people from the

crowd to find that 46 percent of rally
attendees believe the rally affected
yesterday's election. However, the
fact that the rally wasn't organized
by a political party could have a large
impact on whether or not the moderate
voices were heard.
"It depends on if Washington
acknowledges that it happened and
acknowledges the point of it, which
I'm really not sure if they will or not
because it's Washington," Janisse
said of the rally's impact on the elec-
tions. "If they do, I think that it shows
that there are a lot of people out there
who are more in the middle and less
extreme."
ANN ARBOR GOES CENTER
Ann Arbor and the University have
long fallen under the media's leftist
label. Lecture halls are littered with
students in their College Democrats
t-shirts, students patrol the corners of
the Diag armed with petitions urging
sustainable and green practices and
an annual protest of marijuana laws is
celebrated as a campus-wide holiday.
But when you dig a little deeper, you'll
find that we're not living in the hotbed
of liberal activity we think we are.
"I would say people tend to think of
the Michigan campus as very liberal,
and the majority is liberal, but I defi-
nitely think there's more moderates
than you think. My friends are moder-
ate and a lot of them are thinkingabout
probably voting for Snyder," Held said
before yesterday's election.
Bertrand also doesn't believe the
campus is as liberal as often depicted.
"I think we're about 60-40," she
said. "I don't think it's as bad as most
people think."
The College Republicans is the most
visible group of conservative students
on campus. The group, which has been
active since 1892, lobbies for conser-
vative interests and campaigns for
Republican candidates. The group's
membership alone serves as a testa-
ment to the large conservative popula-
tion on campus.
"We have over 2,000 people on our
listserv and we have a group of, I'd say
about 150 that show up regularly at
meetings," said LSA sophomore and
College Republicans Vice Chair Brian
Koziara. "So it's a fairly large group.
Depending on who we bring in as a
speaker, the numbers will be higher or
lower, but we do have a very active and
engaged core."
Rick Snyder's successful campaign
has certainly challenged the idea of
Ann Arbor's liberal foundation. An
Ann Arbor native and University alum,
the Governor elect garnered 50.51 per-
cent of the vote in Washtenaw county
as of 11:53 'p.m. Tuesday night with
43.75 percent of the precincts counted,
This support for a Republican
candidate is recently unprec-
edented in a county where 70
percent of its residents voted
for Barack Obama in the
2008 presidential election

and 68 percent voted for Governor
Jennifer Granholm in 2006.
Similarly, United States Rep. John
Dingell (D-Mich.) has faced a tough-
er campaign than in recent election
cycles. After garnering 87.80 percent
of the Washtenaw county vote in 2006
and 73.48 percent in 2008, Dingell
received just 65.7 percent of Washt-
enaw county's vote as of 11:53 p.m.
Tuesday night with 43.75 percent of
the precincts counted.
Koziara attributes these figures to
a shifting mentality about economic
spending.
"I do think that the conservative
fiscal message has won. I think that's
the reason Ann Arbor is trending away
from its previously blue roots," Kozi-
ara said. "I think a lot of people are
starting to wake up and realize that
this election is all about the economic
issues, the fiscal issues, and I think
that even Democrats in Ann Arbor can
agree with that."
Furthermore, these historically
left-leaning numbers aren't necessar-
ily a characteristic of the student body,
many of whom vote absentee. In fact,
Held believes it's not the students who
are liberals so much as the city's year-
long residents.
"I'm actually from Ann Arbor. I
went to Pioneer so I've seen local elec-
tions for a while now," he said. "So I
would say the people in the city, the
townies, who actually vote ... on the
whole, vote Democratic."
And while the media and cam-
paign ads can sometimes make gross
exaggerations about the state of poli-
tics, many students on campus have a
healthy amount of hope for the future.
"We got kind of lucky," Janisse said
of the gubernatorial race. "Either way,
whoever wins, it's not going to be hor-
rible."
The numbers certainly show a
recent shift to the center, and it's clear
the student body doesn't disregard
the conservative population. When
