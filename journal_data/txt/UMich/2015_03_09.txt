Distinction 

encourages faculty 
to push academic 

boundaries

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

ten • ure (noun): having or 

denoting a permanent post, espe-
cially as a teacher or professor

***

Tenure is an honor — a mark 

of recognition and a reward for 
distinguished contributions to 
scholarship both in terms of 
research and teaching. Subse-
quently, it is a coveted title. For 
students, however, it is quite pos-
sible that tenure is a complete 
mystery. How important is it, and 
how do faculty earn it?

In the realm of academia, 

holding tenure is “being able to 
hold controversial, unpopular or 
provocative views without the 
fear of losing one’s job,” accord-
ing to Sara Blair, vice provost for 

academic and faculty affairs.

“Tenure 
enables 
faculty 

to press research questions, 
teaching, scholarship into areas 
that may be new, that may be 
uncomfortable, 
with 
confi-

dence that the institution will 
protect the freedom of their 
inquiry,” Blair said.

It is important to clarify that 

freedom of speech is afforded 
to all faculty: “The principle 
of freedom of expression and 
protection for the integrity of 
scholarship is of paramount 
importance to officers of the 
University,” Blair said.

“Everyone has freedom of 

speech,” said Lori Pierce, vice 
provost for academic and faculty 
affairs. “But it’s the freedom to 
pursue ideas that perhaps are 
more risky.”

Pierce said the timeline for 

promotion varies among the Uni-
versity’s assorted schools and 
colleges. The University’s maxi-
mum “tenure probationary peri-
od” is 10 years — a deadline set by 
the University’s Medical School.

Reps. work on 
new honor code, 
mental health 

support network 

By LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

With elections for the Cen-

tral 
Student 
Government’s 

2015-2016 leadership less than 
a month away, current members 
of the assembly discussed goals 
they have accomplished this 
semester, initiatives they wish 
they could have achieved and 
issues they hope to address in the 
future.

CSG President Bobby Dishell, 

a Public Policy senior, said his 
benchmark for success has been 
the realization of last year’s 
Make Michigan party platform.

“I think this semester is 

going really well, to be honest,” 
Dishell said. “We accomplished 
pretty much our entire plat-
form so far. So now we’re able 
to take on additional projects 
like the honor code.”

The honor code aims to com-

plement the existing Statement 

of Student Rights and Respon-
sibilities, which outlines Uni-
versity responses to student 
behavior deemed inappropri-
ate. The proposed code asks 
students to pledge to support 
honor, integrity, inclusivity and 
respect.

Dishell mentioned a recent 

resolution that, if passed, will 
ask University administration 
to release data from course 
evaluations, so students could 
see accurate “ratings” of their 
professors and graduate stu-
dent instructors.

Additionally, Make Michi-

gan’s original platform called 
for expanding the Night Owl 
Bus route, revamping the Mich-
igan smartphone application, 
improving off-campus lighting 
and introducing a academic 
minor in entrepreneurship.

Though 
CSG 
announced 

plans in December to discon-
tinue the bus route due to lack 
of funding, University Parking 
Transportation Services ulti-
mately offered enough funds 
to keep the current version of 
the program running at least 
through the end of the semester.

Renowned former 

neurosurgeon 

looks to gain GOP 

nomination 

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

The Big House could meet the 

White House again in 2016.

Ben Carson, retired neuro-

surgeon and graduate of the 
University’s Medical School, is 
considering a run for president in 
2016.

Last week, Carson announced 

the formation of an exploratory 
committee that will weigh the 
potential of a campaign for the 
Republican Party’s nomination.

A neurosurgeon with no previ-

ous experience in elected office, 
for most of his career Carson was 
better known for his contribu-
tions to medicine than his politics. 
He only appeared on the national 
political stage in 2013 after deliv-
ering a speech at the National 
Prayer Breakfast that received 
praise from many conservatives.

33rd annual 

meeting seeks to 
promote career 
development

By SAMIHA MATIN

Daily Staff Reporter

With a focus on confidence 

and respect, The University’s 
Women of Color Task Force 
convened their 33rd annual 
conference Friday.

The annual event aims to 

empower women of color in 
their workplaces and promote 
career and educational devel-
opment. Open to any Univer-
sity employee, the task force 
promotes professional develop-
ment, particularly for women of 
color.

Eilisha Dermont, communi-

cations manager at the Univer-
sity’s Center for the Education 
of Women and a member of the 
WCTF executive team, said the 
conference is the largest profes-
sional development event host-
ed at the University.

Dermont said the task force 

offers 
mentoring 
programs 

and training seminars to help 
women develop leadership and 
workplace skills.

This year’s theme, “Tools for 

the Journey: Self-Awareness, 
Confidence & Respect,” focused 
on 
encouraging 
women 
of 

color to excel in leadership and 
career development as well as 
promoting financial education 
and work-life balance.

By AMABEL KAROUB

Daily News Editor

The 
University’s 
Medical 

School is changing it up.

Beginning with prospective 

students entering in 2017, the 
Medical School has altered the 
admissions requirements for 
its 
applicants. 
Requirements 

previously included a list of 
eight courses in subjects such 
as organic chemistry and bio-
chemistry. They now consist of 
qualities and experiences the 
Medical School looks for in its 
students.

Most of the new prerequisites 

are framed more broadly: rigor-
ous experience in the humani-

ties, academic strength and 
rigor in the fields of biology, 
chemistry and statistical meth-
ods and analysis; demonstrable 
knowledge of basic physical 
principles; and “a clear and dis-
tinct experience in intellectual 
inquiry and active participation 
in the independent discovery of 
new knowledge.”

Though these prerequisites 

may seem less specific than a list 
of classes, Rajesh Mangrulkar, 
associate dean for medical stu-

dent education, expressed the 
opposite sentiment. He said the 
new requirements allow the 
admissions office to be more 
specific, telling the students the 
exact information the Medical 
School needs them to know prior 
to matriculation. He said listing 
a class title does not convey that 
information as effectively.

“When you look at a course 

name, do you know what you’re 
able to do because of having

WHAT YOU MISSED OVER SPRING BREAK: 

PRETTY BROWN GIRLS EVENT AND SKI TRIP SANCTIONS 

Conference seeks 
to empower women 

of color, discuss 

shared experiences 

BY SAMIHA MATIN

Daily Staff Reporter

The University’s chapter of 

the Pretty Brown Girls Club 
hosted 
their 
first 
confer-

ence Saturday with the aim of 
empowering women and chil-
dren with darker skin tones. 
The program was designed 
to provide a platform for club 
mentors and guest lecturers to 
share stories about the types 
of struggles faced by girls of 
color.

Inspired by the original 

Pretty Girls Movement and its 
founder, Sheri Crawley, Azia 
Harris Martin, a junior at Col-
lege of Engineering, founded 
Pretty Brown Girls Club #52 at 

the University in 2013.

“Sheri recognized the need 

to address the harmful mes-
sages about skin tone and beau-
ty in media,” Martin said. “She 
was very concerned about the 
effect on girls who rarely see 
images of their own likeliness 
depicted in a positive manner. 
She created a product line for 
young ladies that carried the 
message ‘Pretty Brown Girls.’ ”

Nationally, the organiza-

tion holds workshops, various 
events and clubs for girls and 
young women. In Ann Arbor, 
Pretty Brown Girls Club #52 
offers mentorship, healthy dia-
logues and social activities to 
young girls.

“Through 
Pretty 
Brown 

Girls Club #52 here, we want to 
fulfill this mission and encour-
age girls to be happy in their 
beautiful brown skin,” Martin 
said.

LSA Student Government 

and the Center for Engineering 
Diversity and Outreach spon-

sored the event, which was 
held on North Campus. The 
event’s theme, “Dream Big, ” 
centered around encouraging 
young girls to sustain passion 
and determination throughout 
their lives and careers.

A discussion panel allowed 

college students, high school 
seniors and professionals to 
share stories about facing and 
overcoming difficulties and 
insecurities stemming from 
the color of their skin.

Izetta Bright, a judge for 

Michigan’s 
36th 
District 

Court, told the group about 
her life-long dream to become 
a lawyer and represent African 
American women, such as her-
self.

“The road had many bumps 

and bruises,” she said. “I came 
from the civil rights era and 
during that time, and even 
now, law has always been a 
white male dominated area 
and you couldn’t even imag-
ine a Black woman in such a 
position. However, as Martin 
Luther King has shown, we 
can all be who we want to be if 
we dream big.”

Adrian Roberson, a high 

school senior who has a pas-
sion for softball, openly talked 
about the sometimes hostile 
treatment 
she 
received 
at 

school.

“In my school where there 

were only five Black students, 
I faced many challenges,” she 
said. “There were teachers 
who didn’t know how to talk 
to Black students or help me. It 
was worse in my softball team 
since I was the only Black girl 
there and some team members 
shunned me and tried to get 
against me because of my cul-
ture and skin. But I worked 
hard, 
overcame 
the 
prob-

lems and showed my tremen-
dous dedication. I managed 
to become the captain of the 
team.”

After vandalism, 
University will no 
longer recognize 
Sigma Alpha Mu

BY ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

The University will no longer 

recognize the fraternity Sigma 
Alpha Mu as a campus student 
organization 
after 
members 

caused thousands of dollars in 
damages at a Northern Michigan 
ski resort, the University said in a 
statement Friday.

SAM, 
along 
with 
sorority 

Sigma Delta Tau, participated in 
a ski trip during the weekend 
of Jan. 16, during which attend-
ees inflicted more than $85,000 
in damages to resort rooms and 
common spaces at the Treetops 
Resort in Gaylord, Mich.

According to the University’s 

release, the outcome was the most 
severe sanction the University 
can levy on a student organiza-
tion.

The 
University 
asked 
the 

national office of SAM to revoke 
the chapter and took further 
sanctions, including requiring 
the chapter to pay the damage to 
Treetops in full and participate 
in “restorative measures” in the 
Gaylord community. The period 
of separation is specified as four 
years.

The University has also asked 

SAM to implement provisions 
to help prevent excessive alco-
hol and drug abuse and sexual 
assault. Members of SAM are to 
be in frequent communication 
with the Dean of Students Office 
throughout their sanction.

SAM nationals were not ready 

to provide a statement when 
reached Friday afternoon.

Sigma Delta Tau has been 

placed on disciplinary suspension 
for two years.

“Members of the Sigma Delta 

Tau sorority stood by at Treetops 
Resort and allowed others to van-
dalize the facility,” the Univer-

sity’s statement read. “This lack of 
action is unacceptable.”

Upon conclusion of the Greek 

Activities Review Panel’s judi-
ciary process, the body initially 
recommended 
the 
University 

suspend SAM from IFC until the 
Winter 2016 semester.

The 
GARP 
justices 
found 

SAM to be in violation of the 
Standards of Conduct for Rec-
ognized Student Organizations. 
The violations included engaging 
in illegal activities such as exces-
sive alcohol and marijuana use, 
violating the Student Organiza-
tion Constitution and risking the 
health of safety of others through 
their destruction, which included 
throwing a chair through a win-
dow that landed in a children’s 
play area.

The suspension would have 

banned participation in Greek 
Week and other Greek life activi-
ties, prevented members from 
holding positions with the Inter-
fraternity Council, denied voting 
rights at IFC meetings and pre-
vented participation in IM sports. 
Additionally, the chapter would 
not be allowed to recruit during 
the period of separation.

However, Dean of Students 

Laura Blake Jones, who approved 
the final disciplinary actions 
based on GARP’s recommenda-
tion, went further to disband 
SAM as a campus organization.

“While the sanctions GARP 

outlined may have been sufficient 
and appropriate in a situation 
where the individuals involved 
were taking responsibility, or 
where 
chapter 
officers 
were 

providing 
information 
about 

individual accountability to the 
University, this is not true in this 
instance,” Jones wrote in a state-
ment of the University’s decision.

In a letter, Jones thanked 

GARP for thoughtful and well-
written sanctions, but said that 
the behavior was “reprehensible” 
and caused “extensive harm” to 
the Gaylord, the University and 
Greek life communities.

“Equally 
reprehensible, 
is 

the failure of Sigma Alpha Mu 
bystanders to officially report or 

stop the vandalism,” she wrote.

The chapter, which will be 

deemed permanently separated 
from the University, cannot apply 
to return to campus for four years. 
To do so, they must have followed 
the conditions outlined by GARP’s 
recommended 
reprimands, 

including completing restitution 
and carrying out chapter and 
individual disciplinary efforts. 
Along with educational programs 
on bystander intervention and 
excessive alcohol use, SAM is to 
complete a service project to help 
mend the relationship between 
the chapter and the resort.

For SDT, GARP recommended 

sanctions including educational 
sessions, 
community 
service, 

an internal membership review 
completed by their national orga-
nization, the issuance of a for-
mal apology, an indefinite ban 
on overnight trips with fraterni-
ties and social probation through 
April 21, which includes off cam-
pus events and formals.

However, the University again 

went beyond those recommenda-
tions to issue a two-year disciplin-
ary suspension, citing the same 
explanation for the expanded 
sanctions against SAM.

The suspension limits the SDT’s 

recruitment and social activities 
and removes the chapter from 
active membership in the Panhel-
lenic Association for two years.

Debbie 
Snyder, 
executive 

director of Sigma Delta Tau’s 
national headquarters, said she 
did not believe the punishment 
for the SDT members was just.

“While the Sigma Delta Tau 

National Organization supports 
the majority of GARP’s recom-
mendations, we strongly believe 
that the university’s additional 
sanctions are unreasonable due 
to the lack of specific evidence 
linking our chapter members to 
the allegations,” Snyder said in a 
statement. “It is Sigma Delta Tau’s 
opinion that our women did not 
play a part in the destruction and 
vandalism on site.”

Students barred from voting

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

A member of the Northwestern student section cheers as 
Tuesday’s men’s basketball game goes into double overtime. 
The Wolverines went on to lose 82-78.

DIE- HARD

The city of Ann Arbor 

denied allegations that it 
had prevented students from 
voting in an election. Three 
students were denied from 
registering 
because 
they 

were no longer considered 
residents of Ann Arbor after 
a court decision that changed 
Michigan’s interpretation of 
residency. Though each of 
the three students were mar-
ried, they did not have jobs in 
Ann Arbor and were deemed 
to be students attending 
school in the city, not actual 
residents.

The 
Michigan 
Daily 

reported that Ann Arbor 
experienced an “exception-
al” number of citizens regis-

tering to vote in 1952.

32 years ago today 
(March 9, 1983)

Second-year law student 

James Picozzi suffered sec-
ond-degree burns and a bro-
ken back when he jumped 
out of the window of his 
dorm on the third floor of the 
Law Quad to escape a fire.

At the time, the Ann Arbor 

police said the fire might 
have been lit intentionally.

Ann Arbor Fire Mar-

shall Wesley Prater said he 
believed gasoline was used 
to ignite the fire. Picozzi 
was unable to escape the 
flames because they blocked 

the entrance to his dorm. 
Instead, he sat on the ledge 
of a window until it became 
too hot and he was forced to 
jump.

While fellow law students 

were surprised by what hap-
pened and did not think 
that anyone would want to 
murder Picozzi, it was well 
known that his classmates 
disliked him.

Motives presented at the 

time were that he did not 
get along well with his class-
mates, and they resented that 
he was given extra time on 
tests because he was missing 
the ends of two fingers.

Steven Gay, assistant dean

the logic behind requiring profi-

credit. He said the old require-
ments did not take into account 
that students may learn neces-
sary material outside of the con-
ventional classroom.

“We see a number of students 

right now … with advanced 
degrees, or who have spent exten-
sive time in labs,” Gay said. “I 
think we should give students the 
opportunity if they are learning 
in those innovative and different 
ways not to have to repeat things 
unnecessarily.”

Mangrulkar 
said 
the 
new 

application process is meant to 
create a dialogue in which stu-
dents can reflect on how they 
have earned the knowledge they 
need, whether it be from a class or 
from another experience.

“The student will be able to 

say, ‘alright, these are the expec-
tations, let me reflect on what 
I’ve done and show how these 
all meet those different crite-
ria,’” Mangrulkar said. “That’s 
a better way to have a conversa-
tion than what we’ve had in the 
past, which is basically a student 
saying ‘I took this class, is this 
okay?’”

Gay said that, though students 

have the freedom to gain knowl-
edge in unique ways under the 
new requirements, taking classes 
is still the easiest way to fulfill the 
prerequisites.

Listed with the new prerequi-

sites is a group of Core Competen-
cies. The four competencies are 

analytical thought and problem-
solving skills, written and verbal 
communication, 
mathematical/

statistical analysis and applica-
tion of hypothesis-driven meth-
ods of research. Mangrulkar 
said these competencies began 
as expectations for residents, but 
have now trickled down to the 
pre-medical level.

“It started triggering a discus-

sion in our realm saying, ‘What 
are our competencies and how do 
they line up with the fact that 98 
to 99 percent of medical students 
go on to do a residency?’ ” he said. 
“Shouldn’t there be some align-
ment?”

Mangrulkar added that the 

University’s 
changed 
require-

ments are part of an overall 
shift in pre-medical education 
in the United States. He said the 
changes stem, in part, from col-
laboration with the Association 
of American Medical Colleges, 
a national organization that is 
strongly allied with many medi-
cal school admissions teams.

“There 
were 
sessions 
and 

conferences asking what are the 
issues with pre-medical require-
ments,” Mangrulkar said. “I think 
the fundamental premise is that 
all of medical education is moving 
towards much more specificity on 
what we, as a profession, expect 
physicians to be able to do.”

Implicit in the new pre-med 

requirements is a push for well-
rounded pre-med students who 
have knowledge and experi-
ence beyond what one gains in 
the classroom. Mangrulkar said 
the medical profession has been 
searching for this type of student 
for some time.

“I think for the longest time 

the profession has wanted stu-
dents who are not only academi-

cally excellent,” Mangrulkar said. 
“If students think that by getting 
the A in biochemistry and getting 
an outstanding MCAT score, that 
that is a ticket to medical school, 
that has not been the case for a 
long time, it really hasn’t.”

Mangrulkar 
added 
that, 

ultimately, what the Medical 
School looks for in its students 
are the same qualities that a 
patient would seek in his or her 
doctor.

“If we’re not aligned, our edu-

cation program, with what our 
patients want in their doctor, 
then there’s a disconnect there,” 
he said.

Gay also spoke to the qualities 

that make a good applicant.

“Great applicants have expe-

riences that not every applicant 
for medical school has,” Gay said. 
“They may do Teach for America, 
they may do the Peace Corps, they 
may work in the lab, they may 
work on Wall Street, they may 
build programs and do things as 
undergraduates that give them 
the opportunity to learn in great 
depth a lot of the topics that we 
look at.”

Students in the Class of 2016 

will have the option of completing 
either the new or the old require-
ments. Mangrulkar said the 2016 
cycle is meant to serve as a transi-
tion period.

Though the difference between 

the old and the new requirements 
may seem drastic, Mangrulkar 
said it really isn’t.

“The movement in the pre-

med requirements, I wouldn’t 
see as being that big a deal,” he 
said. “It just allows us to be more 
specific, and actually to be more 
inclusive, giving credit for the 
stuff that our pre-med students 
already do.”

the MedEx Academy, presented 
the conference’s keynote speech.

The conference also included 

22 workshop sessions around 
campus, which focused leader-
ship and workplace development 
pertaining to this year’s theme.

Inspired 
by 
the 
WCTF’s 

programs, GHS created their 
own professional development 
opportunities for women of 
color. The initiative ultimately 
resulted in an alliance between 
the University and GHS to fur-
ther 
increase 
development 

opportunities for people at both 
institutions.

As a director of operations, 

training and human resources, 
Squire promotes diversity and 
leadership development at dif-
ferent institutions by mentoring 
staff. He helps organizations and 
individuals achieve success by 

promoting mutual respect and 
investing in “human capital.”

Squire discussed GHS’s slow 

evolution to a diverse communi-
ty throughout the years and his 
involvement as a director there.

“My personal mission is to 

educate, enable and empower 
individuals and teams to achieve 
excellence,” Squire said.

During his speech, Squire 

focused on how “color groups” 
can be used to represent work 
performance. He discussed how 
people could be broken into red, 
yellow and green groups to indi-
cate differences in work moti-
vation, skills and performances 
among the workforce.

“Colors 
reflect 
our 
lives 

because we all have them,” 
Squire said. “We bring them 
to our work. They bring up 
the question — what color are 
you? Are you the manager who 
never provides follow up to 
your instructions? Are you the 
person in the team who always 

complains and tries to bring the 
team down? Or are you a differ-
ent color because you are always 
sincere in work and take risks to 
achieve your goals?”

Using this concept of colors — 

where green is considered the best 
of the workforce — Squire also 
discussed implementing changes 
to increase the staff’s efficiency 
and satisfaction and to understand 
problems stemming from a lack 
of communication, initiative and 
awareness of consequences.

“The most important respon-

sibilities of leadership are to 
recognize, respond and reward,” 
Squire said. “Then you can have 
your work done the way you 
want it done every day.”

Squire concluded his speech 

by emphasizing the importance 
of a diverse workforce.

“We are the most creative when 

we are not homogenous,” Squire 
said. 
“Working 
with 
various 

groups of people can create the 
most effective leadership skills.”

Carson, who was born in 

Detroit, enrolled at the University 
after completing his undergradu-
ate education at Yale University. 
He graduated from the University 
in 1977 and spent his career prac-
ticing pediatric neurosurgery at 
Johns Hopkins University.

Carson became the first sur-

geon to separate twins con-
joined at the head. He went on 
to perform the surgery several 
times and develop a method to 
remove deeply embedded brain 
tumors, before retiring from 
medicine in 2013.

After Carson’s 2013 speech at 

the National Prayer Breakfast, 
prominent 
Republican 
John 

Philip Sousa IV created the 
National Draft Ben Carson for 
President Committee dedicated 
to helping Carson gain a nomi-
nation for the 2016 presidential 
election. The committee’s catch-
phrase is “Run, Ben, Run.”

A 
month 
later, 
Carson 

returned to the University to 
give a lecture hosted by the 
Alpha Omega Alpha medical 
honor society and the Depart-
ment of Neuroscience.

In the lecture, Carson encour-

aged future physicians to branch 
out into the political sphere, 
emphasizing that doctors are 
the best people to talk about 
health care policies, as they deal 
with these programs and regu-

lations every day.

During a speech at the 2015 

Conservative Political Action 
Conference in February, Car-
son outlined several broad plat-
form ideas, including welfare 
reform and the replacement of 
the Affordable Care Act with a 
health saving accounts system.

With health saving accounts, 

individuals can contribute a spe-
cific amount of money per year 
towards healthcare expenses 
that is not subject to federal 
income tax. Individuals, not the 
government or a corporation, 
own the accounts. They are cur-
rently only available to those 
who have health care plans with 
high deductibles.

“It is not affordable,” Car-

son said of the ACA. “And it is 
absolutely about redistribution 
and control. If we really wanted 
to use our intellect, we would 
come up with something that 
works for everybody.”

Last week, Carson attracted 

widespread 
media 
attention 

for comments during a CNN 
interview in which he said 
homosexuality is a choice, cit-
ing that people “go into prison 
straight, and when they come 
out, they‘re gay.”

He later apologized for the 

remarks, but said he would not 
address gay rights issues for the dura-
tion of his presidential campaign.

Contact information for a 

Carson spokesperson was not 
immediately available.

Aaron Kall, director of the 

University’s debate team and 
an expert in election politics, 
said Carson probably did not 
get involved in politics while at 
the University because he came 
for graduate school.

“I think that his time at 

Michigan, just being a medical 
student, and all of the rigorous 
amount of time and everything, 
I don’t know how much time he 
had to dabble into politics while 
in graduate school,” Kall said.

In the two years that have 

passed 
since 
he 
spoke 
at 

the University, Carson has 
advanced from a name thrown 
around when talking about the 
2016 presidential election to a 
serious contender.

“(Carson is) not a frontrun-

ner in the GOP, but certainly a 
candidate, a legitimate candi-
date,” Kall said.

This year’s CPAC straw poll 

placed Carson fourth among 
likely Republican candidates, 
pulling 11.4 percent of the vote. 
He placed behind Kentucky 
Sen. Rand Paul, Wisconsin Gov. 
Scott Walker and Texas Sen. 
Ted Cruz, but ahead of former 
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

Even so, Kall said he has 

doubts about Carson’s ability to 
gain the nomination.

“He got about just over 10 

percent of the vote, showing 
that he’s a legitimate candidate 
in 2016,” Kall said. “But I don’t 
think that he would be consid-
ered one of the very top most 
formidable favorites.”

“What’s different about the 

Medical School?” Pierce asked. 
“Many of the faculty are like 
myself. We teach medical stu-
dents, we work with residents, 
we treat patients, which is a very 
big part of our time. We are also 
doing research, we are also get-
ting grants, we are also publish-
ing papers.”

***

Typically, the journey to tenure 

commences at the beginning of a 
professor’s career, when he or she 
is an assistant professor.

Using LSA as an example, LSA 

Dean Andrew Martin said assis-
tant professors are often evalu-
ated for promotion at the end of 
their fifth academic year at the 
University.

At this time, action begins at 

the departmental level, where the 
faculty member in question starts 
by giving his or her respective 
department a teaching statement, 
research statement, statement of 
service, curriculum vitae and a 
portfolio of published works.

Martin said the teaching state-

ment “describes their pedagogy 
(and) describes their teaching 
experience.”

Once these items have been 

submitted, the department then 
solicits letters of evaluation from 
leading scholars in the faculty 
member’s field of study — typical-
ly amassing 10 to 12 letters total.

All of this happens between 

the end of one school year and the 
beginning of the next. By Octo-
ber, all items have been provided 
to the department, and by Novem-
ber, 
the 
department 
decides 

whether or not it will recommend 
the faculty member to be consid-
ered for tenure by administrative 
bodies in LSA.

At this level, Martin said, there 

are three main criteria for exam-
ining a professor’s overall qual-
ity: Whether or not the professor 
is an “outstanding scholar” who 
has completed original research; 
whether or not the professor is 
a distinguished and committed 
teacher, something that is quanti-
tatively and qualitatively decided 
by student course evaluations and 
observations by already-tenured 
faculty; and whether or not the 
professor has done “service” to 
the institution through advising 
roles and committee work, and 
to his or her profession overall 
through work with professional 
associations, for example.

Martin added that the third 

criterion regarding service is less 
important in regards to the tran-
sition from assistant professor to 
associate professor with tenure, 
and more important at a higher-
level promotion, like full profes-

sor.

If the transition from assistant 

to associate represents recogni-
tion of scholarship, Martin said, 
then the transition from associ-
ate to full or higher denotes an 
expanding breadth of study. How-
ever, the benefits of tenure remain 
the same, whether a member of 
the faculty is an associate or full 
professor.

“In addition to supporting aca-

demic freedom, tenure also pro-
vides security,” Martin said. “And 
we would expect our best faculty 
members, once they’re tenured, to 
begin to focus a little bit beyond 
the core things that they’re 
invested in.”

“The way I view it is, when we 

tenure someone, we’re making 
a huge investment in them, and 
our expectation is that they’re 
going to continue to make a big 
investment in the University not 
just through research and teach-
ing, but in other ways as well,” he 
added.

The first administrative body to 

examine the departmental port-
folio is the Divisional Executive 
Committee. LSA is split into three 
divisions: Humanities, Social Sci-
ences and Natural Sciences. Two 
representatives from each of the 
three divisions and four other 
elected faculty representatives 
from within LSA comprise the 
DEC — which doesn’t vote on the 
faculty member’s pending tenure, 
but instead aims to “discuss and 
characterize 
the 
scholarship,” 

Martin noted.

This discussion is then submit-

ted in the form of a report with 
the departmental portfolio to the 
College Executive Committee. 
This body votes to recommend a 
faculty member for tenure to the 
Office of the Provost.

The CEC is smaller than the 

DEC, and is comprised of two 
members from each of the three 
LSA divisions. Martin sits on the 
committee as an ex officio, and 
only votes if there is a tie.

This entire process is meant to 

evaluate a faculty member solely 
upon his or her academic excel-
lence, and not upon other intan-
gible qualities.

“One thing that this college has 

done with some really great lead-
ership over the last few decades is 
to think very carefully about our 
promotion and tenure process to 
remove sources of bias,” Martin 
said.

This yields “a real rigid follow-

ing of our process … to remove 
those intangibles.” For example, 
talking about race, gender, reli-
gion, age or any part of a person’s 
background is completely off the 
table, Martin said.

Once the CEC recommends a 

faculty member for tenure to the 
Office of the Provost, the vice 
provosts and University Provost 
Martha Pollack conduct a final 

review of the faculty member’s 
portfolio by mid-February.

Pollack reads each casebook 

and evaluates the CEC’s recom-
mendation, re-reading the faculty 
member’s portfolio and looking 
for context. For example, Pollack 
said, in examining teaching excel-
lence, she looks to see whether or 
not a faculty member innovated 
in his or her teaching methods, or 
if that person mentored students 
outside of the classroom.

“I think what has evolved for 

me is a broad appreciation of how 
these fundamental questions play 
out differently in different dis-
ciplines,” Pollack said. “I mean, 
I have this bird’s eye view … and 
what it means to have impact 
when you’re a medical research-
er is very different from what 
it means to have impact when 
you’re an English professor. But 
in both cases, that’s what we’re 
looking at.”

Ultimately, if the Office of 

the Provost approves the fac-
ulty member for tenure, Pollack 
submits a report to the Board 
of Regents, which has the final 
say.

***

Blair and Pierce said it’s not 

entirely uncommon for faculty 
members who are being recruited 
by other institutions to perhaps 
try and fast track their tenure 
process. However, as Martin 
noted, the process is rigid in its 
search for excellence.

“Never once have I seen a 

shoddy casebook,” Pollack said. 
“The process is always very 
careful, because it’s so impor-
tant.”

“It’s not exactly a marketplace,” 

Blair said. “As an institution, we 
take tenure very seriously. The 
process for granting tenure is 
absolutely the same whether it’s 
a Nobel Prize-winning physicist 
who is coming to us from outside, 
or someone on our faculty is being 
recruited (elsewhere), or a young 
assistant professor who came up 
through the ranks here. We stand 
behind the process.”

And according to Pollack, that 

process is not just important, 
but essential to the growth of 
academia. Pollack is a tenured 
professor in the School of Infor-
mation.

“Tenure is a right to express 

your opinion without fear of 
losing your job, but it’s also a 
responsibility in my view,” she 
said. “It’s a responsibility to 
seek the truth and to speak the 
truth, and speak up when you 
think that views that are being 
expressed are inaccurate. And 
I think that’s a very powerful 
mechanism for getting people to 
make sure that they grapple with 
difficult issues.”

CSG launched an initiative not 
specifically featured in Make 
Michigan’s 2014-2015 platform.

The Wolverine Support Net-

work, which launched in Sep-
tember, aims to address mental 
health issues on campus through 
peer support groups and com-
munity events.

CSG Vice President Emily 

Lustig, an LSA senior, said she 
is most proud of the assembly’s 
work developing the Wolverine 
Support Network.

“I think everyone has, if it’s 

not themselves or a family mem-
ber, some connection to men-
tal health or mental wellness,” 
Lustig said. “Enacting a program 
with the ability to change peo-
ple’s lives and addressing mental 
health, and trying to break the 
mental health stigma is some-
thing that is so important.”

Though some feel there has 

been progress in certain areas of 
policy, LSA senior Emily Sexton, 
a CSG representative, said the 
assembly’s actions thus far have 
been somewhat insignificant.

“This year, I’ve felt like 

we haven’t done anything or 
brought any really great reso-
lutions,” she said. “We haven’t 
taken any risks. It just feels like 
CSG isn’t important.”

She said CSG’s executive leader-

ship have accomplished their indi-
vidual goals, but haven’t expanded 
much beyond those efforts.

“I just think that the assembly 

is kind of there to aid (Dishell 
and Lustig) to get the things 
done that they want to get done,” 
Sexton added.

LSA junior Jacob Ruby, a CSG 

representative and chair of the 
assembly’s finance committee, 
said two resolutions in particu-
lar have been markers of success 
during his term.

“I, for one, sponsored a resolu-

tion that’s going to add 60 charg-
ing stations in the UGLi,” he 
said. “There’s (also) an upcoming 
resolution that should help with 
some of the safety and cleanli-
ness concerns in the CCRB and 
IM (Building). Just a lot of really 
good things coming up.”

However, 
he 
added 
that 

addressing issues of diversity 
on campus has not been a strong 
point for the assembly.

“One of the main concerns 

I’ve seen here on CSG is minor-
ity enrollment,” he said “There 

have been a lot of resolutions that 
have been passed and commit-
tees formed, and there just hasn’t 
been that much actual results.”

Increasing minority enroll-

ment through on-site admis-
sions at schools in the Detroit 
area was a point on Make Michi-
gan’s original platform.

In December, CSG passed a 

resolution to support such pro-
grams, creating a task force to 
work with the Office of Admis-
sions. The group would have 
until March to report back with 
strategies for implementing an 
on-site admissions program or 
reasons why the initiative would 
be unfeasible for the University.

In this vein, one element of 

Dishell’s presidential platform 
that did not come to fruition was 
partnering with the University’s 
Alumni Association to fund 
more LEAD scholarships.

LEAD scholarships are mer-

it-based monies for minority 
applicants. Though the assembly 
approved funds for the project, 
they were barred from providing 
funding under state law since 
University funds cannot be used 
for scholarships to specifically 
promote diversity, and CSG’s 
budget comes from student fees.

I love the University of Michigan. I am proud 
to be a graduate and a faculty member. I 
respect the school’s leadership and admire the 
integrity it brings to decision-making. But I 
do not understand why Michigan has a smok-
ing policy that empowers smokers to assault 
the people I love. The statistics are compel-
ling; each year, secondhand smoke kills nearly 
three times the number killed by violent crime 
in the United States. I need your help changing 
the University’s policy.

Michigan’s 
smoking 
policy 
is 
well 

intentioned. 
It 
was 
developed 
through 

an inclusive and thoughtful process that 
involved input from students, faculty and 
staff, representing many of the schools across 
campus. The concept of an almost smoke-free 
campus was bold and pioneering when the 
policy was developed. However, today, smoke-
free campuses are common, with 1,514 as of 
Jan. 1, according to the American Nonsmokers’ 
Rights Foundation; many of them have more 
comprehensive policies than Michigan.

Michigan’s policy has one fatal (literally) 

flaw. It allows smoking on the miles of sidewalks 
adjacent to the streets that snake through and 
frame our campus, the sidewalks we all use to 
enter and roam the campus, arguably the most 
densely populated parts of campus.

On a typical walk from my office on East 

Huron to any place on campus, I have to 
walk through four groups of smokers. When 
possible, I suspend breathing and accelerate 
my pace, allowing me to dash through the 
smoke and avoid being forced to draw the 
toxins into my lungs. I resent being imposed 
upon in this way, but I can live with it (I hope). 
However, I worry about people who cannot 
— people who cannot suspend breathing or 
accelerate their pace. I worry about people in 
wheelchairs, people with asthma, emphysema 

or heart disease, conditions that can provoke 
an immediate severe reaction to a tiny amount 
of secondhand smoke. I worry about infants 
in their mothers’ arms because their delicate 
lungs can be harmed by this exposure.

Smokers are not bad people. Harming 

others is the last thing they would ever want to 
do. Most do realize their secondhand smoke is 
disgusting, but they figure it just goes up in the 
air. So what’s the big deal?

When smokers spew their secondhand 

smoke into the air, it is the only circumstance 
in which people are unwillingly exposed 
to a known Group A carcinogen and the 
perpetrators are not committing a federal 
crime punishable by severe penalties. Breath 
per breath, secondhand smoke may actually be 
more dangerous than direct smoke because it’s 
generated at lower temperatures, is produced 
in an oxygen-deficient environment and 
is rapidly diluted and cooled after leaving 
the 
burning 
tobacco. 
These 
conditions 

favor formation of smaller particulates in 
secondhand smoke (ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 
µm in diameter) than in mainstream smoke 
(ranging from 0.1 to 1 µm), and small particles 
have greater killing power because they can 
penetrate directly into the blood through 
the lungs. Secondhand smoke also typically 
contains higher concentrations of ammonia 
(40- to 170-fold), nitrogen oxides (4- to 10-fold) 
and chemical carcinogens (e.g., benzene, 
10-fold; N-nitrosamines, 6- to 100-fold; and 
aniline, 30-fold) than mainstream smoke.

The impact is powerful and immediate. 

For the period 1965–2009, secondhand smoke 
killed an estimated 1.8 million people in the 
United States, and it still kills an estimated 
41,280 every year (down from more than 
81,000 in 1965 when more people smoked 
and fewer smoke-free policies were in place).

MICHAEL O’DONNELL | VIEWPOINT

D

espite some progress made 
during the student protests 
of the 1960s, our society 

frequently ignores 
the opinions of 
us students along 
with anyone out-
side the narrow 
class of people it 
deems “experts.” 
Who 
are 
the 

“experts”? 
They 

are high-ranking 
public 
officials, 

certain 
Ph.D.s, 

owners of jumbo 
jets and people with the last name 
Bush or Kennedy. But you don’t need 
to be an expert in order to under-
stand the elementary phenomena 
within a certain subject. Or, as the 
singer/songwriter Bob Dylan once 
wrote, “You don’t need a weath-
erman to know which way the 
 

wind blows.”

Massachusetts Institute of Tech-

nology linguist and renowned dis-
sident Noam Chomsky takes up the 
issue of our society’s “culture of the 
expert,” along with other concerns 
about the need for ordinary people 
to critically analyze the actions 
of states and governments, in his 
essay, “The Responsibility of Intel-
lectuals.” Though of course he has 
near-encyclopedic knowledge in a 
wide variety of subjects, Chomsky 
vehemently opposes the alienation 
of ordinary people from political 
discourse. He wrote, “There is no 
body of theory or significant body 
of relevant information beyond 
the comprehension of the lay-
man, which makes policy immune 
from criticism. To the extent that 
‘expert knowledge’ is applied to 
world affairs, it is surely appropri-
ate — for a person of any integrity, 
quite necessary — to question its 
quality and the goals it serves.” 
What’s more, the extensive body of 
information available to laypeople 
today has enhanced their capacity 
to criticize policy and to question 
“expert knowledge.”

It is the responsibility of intellec-

tuals, then, to use this body of infor-
mation and theory to question and 
sometimes to challenge the claims 
made by political establishment.

Since last week he addressed 

a joint session of Congress argu-
ing against the nuclear compro-
mise being negotiated by world 
powers (including the U.S.) and 
Iran, let’s take, for example, the 
“expert knowledge” of Israeli Prime 
 

Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The week before his address 

to Congress, Al Jazeera released 
leaked spy cables between the South 
African government and the Moss-
ad, the Israeli equivalent of the CIA, 
incidentally answering some of our 
questions regarding Netanyahu’s 
“expert 
knowledge,” 
specifically 

questions about its “quality and the 
goals it serves.”

In a speech before the United 

Nations in 2012, Netanyahu sounded 
similar alarms to those he sounded 
last week, regarding the imminence 
of Iran’s nuclear threat, saying that 
Iran would obtain its first nuclear 
bomb by that coming spring or, 
at the latest, that summer. But, in 
their report sent to South Africa 
just weeks later, the Mossad con-
tradicted Netanyahu’s testimony. 
The leaked report said: “Bottom 
line: though Iran at this stage is not 
performing the activity necessary 
to produce weapons, it is working to 

close gaps in areas that appear legit-
imate …” The leaked document not 
only refutes Netanyahu’s claims, it 
also suggests that Netanyahu know-
ingly lied to the UN. So much for his 
“expert knowledge.”

This is but one illustration of the 

dangers of having absolute faith in 
our leaders. This instance is also 
proof of the importance of every-
one, but especially those who call 
themselves intellectuals, to question 
“expert knowledge” and challenge 
their respective authority.

Nonetheless, such blatant lies 

often go unnoticed and unques-
tioned. (If it weren’t for the leaked 
spy cables, we may have never 
noticed the contradiction between 
Netanyahu’s claims and the reality 
according to his government’s own 
intelligence agency — though the 
evidence that refuted his claims was 
within our grasp.) Chomsky empha-
sizes in his essay that what’s con-
demnable isn’t merely politicians 
lying to us, but rather the entire 
political establishment, especially 
intellectuals allowing politicians 
to lie and get away with it. “It is of 
no particular interest,” Chomsky 
wrote, “that one man is quite happy 
to lie in behalf of a cause which he 
knows to be unjust; but it is signifi-
cant that such events provoke so 
little response in the intellectual 
community.” It is the responsibility 
of intellectuals, then, not to allow 
themselves to merely acquiesce on 
the claims made by the powerful, 
but rather to analyze the claims and 
actions of the powerful according 
to their causes, motives and often 
hidden intentions.

We should further consider the 

burden of proof our intellectual 
community sets before world lead-
ers. One reason Netanyahu can lie 
with such ease in the realm of for-
eign policy is because no one seems 
to care about the difference between 
actually being threatened and mere-
ly feeling threatened. Hence the 
supposed evidence of the threat isn’t 
sufficiently scrutinized because it is 
not the threat itself but the feeling of 
being threatened that people seem 
to care about.

In his essay, Chomsky speaks 

to this point in the context of the 
(then) current U.S. policy toward 
Communist China; however, the 
faulty intellectual principle he 
identifies endures to this day. “To 
prove that we are menaced is of 
course unnecessary, and the matter 
receives no attention; it is enough 
that we feel menaced.”

In her essay, “Indigeneity, Settler 

Colonialism, White Supremacy,” 
Andrea Smith offers one explana-
tion for why and how this mere 
“feeling menaced” works so effec-
tively in our political discourse. 
 

 “The logic of orientalism marks 
certain peoples or nations as inferi-
or and deems them to be a constant 
threat to the wellbeing of empire. 
These peoples are still seen as 
‘civilisations’ — they are not prop-
erty or the ‘disappeared.’ However, 
they are imagined as permanent 
foreign threats to empire … Conse-
quently, orientalism serves as the 
anchor of war, because it allows 
the United States to justify being 
in a constant state of war to protect 
itself from its enemies.”

(Here, Smith uses Edward Said’s 

term “orientalism,” or “the process 
of the West’s defining itself as a 
superior civilization by construct-
ing itself in opposition to an ‘exotic’ 

but inferior ‘Orient’,” to signify more 
than what has been historically 
named the “Orient” or “Asia” (e.g., 
the Middle East)).

Under the influence of oriental-

ism, we feel threatened by the mere 
fact of certain peoples or nations 
existence. For example, under orien-
talism we’re supposed to believe that 
a congregation of Muslims chanting 
“Death to America! Death to Israel!” 
(as seen regularly on Fox News) con-
stitutes a threat. The point is not 
that these people definitively do not 
constitute a threat — some funda-
mentalist groups, such as ISIS, sure-
ly constitute at least some threat. 
Rather, the point is that it’s not even 
a question whether they do or not 
actually menace or threaten us.

What also isn’t a question, to 

return to the issue of Iran’s nuclear 
program, is what threat Iran would 
pose if they actually acquired a 
nuclear weapon. Anyone who thinks 
about this question for a few seconds 
realizes, “Oh, yeah: If Iran used a 
nuclear weapon on Israel, the U.S. 
or its allies would wipe Iran off the 
map.” The real threat of Iran acquir-
ing a nuclear weapon would be a 
threat to Israel’s absolute power in 
the region; that is, an Iranian nucle-
ar weapon would likely act at most 
as a deterrent to, say, the continued 
settlement of the West Bank (inter-
nationally recognized as illegal) as 
well as future episodes of what the 
Israeli Defense Forces calls “mow-
ing the lawn” in Gaza (i.e., the rou-
tine slaughtering of Gazans).

Our society’s orientalist ideologi-

cal assumption deems these kinds 
of questions and lines of inquiry 
unnecessary. Thus, when world 
leaders like Netanyahu make (false) 
allegations regarding, say, our ene-
my’s nuclear development, we’re 
supposed to immediately declare: 
“Of course you should attack those 
savages! If they exist, we should 
kill them; if they (might) exist with 
nuclear weapons, we should kill 
them even more!” The efficacy of 
this logic depends on us ordinary 
citizens and intellectuals not dis-
tinguishing between feeling men-
aced and actually being menaced, 
and not questioning whether or 
not we actually are menaced. It is 
the responsibility of intellectuals 
then to criticize “expert knowl-
edge” in order to defend against 
such faulty logic and its hidden 
 

ideological assumptions and biases.

Unfortunately, we don’t all have 

the time or energy to do the nec-
essary research. Thankfully, as 
Chomsky points out, “For a privi-
leged minority (the intellectuals), 
Western democracy provides the 
leisure, the facilities and the train-
ing to seek the truth lying hidden 
behind the veil of distortion and 
misrepresentation, ideology and 
class interest, through which the 
events of current history are pre-
sented to us.” It is the responsibil-
ity of intellectuals then to speak 
truth, expose lies and challenge 
authority on behalf of those with-
out the leisure, the facilities and 
the training prerequisite to do so. 
It is the responsibility of intellec-
tuals to offer people an alternative 
to the propaganda perpetuated by 
our politicians and the pious por-
tion of the intellectual community. 
In short, it is the responsibility of 
intellectuals to dissent.

On average, every 25 smokers kill one 
innocent person over a lifetime. For 
every person who dies, 10 more get 
sick, some of them with debilitating 
conditions. The Surgeon General 
concluded there is no safe level of 
secondhand smoke, so if you smell 
smoke, you are being assaulted. 
In fact, emerging research at the 
University of Oklahoma is finding 
that the extract from just one puff 
of secondhand smoke can cause 
 

DNA damage.

College students who smoke 

are the unknowing victims of 
nicotine. They start smoking with 

their smoker friends, still think 
of 
themselves 
as 
non-smokers, 

fully intending to quit when they 
graduate, only to discover they are 
indeed addicted and cannot quit. A 
smoke-free campus helps them quit 
because it is harder to find a place 
to feed their addiction. National 
studies show three out of four 
smokers want to quit, and half try 
every year, but only four to seven 
percent are successful.

What can we do about this? 

Change the policy. We can protect 
the people we love, people who are 
the most vulnerable, and we can 

eliminate this assault on each of us 
through a simple change in policy. 
If you know someone who has heart 
disease, respiratory problems, is 
in a wheelchair, or is vulnerable to 
secondhand smoke for any reason, 
please let me know and I will work 
with them to change this policy 
even faster. Their support will 
make the difference.

T

he air and ocean were warm as I lay on a 
beach chair, headphones in. That beach 
was private and rarely crowded, and I 

wore a blue and purple two-
piece 
swimsuit, 
gathered 

at the chest and hips with 
beaded strings. I was uncon-
cerned that the relatively few 
people lying near me would 
see me in it.

When I got dressed that 

morning, I didn’t consider 
that my bikini and I might 
become the focus of iPhone 
cameras 
belonging 
to 

whomever would be sitting 
next to me. When I saw the phones pointed 
at me, I was alarmed and thoroughly creeped 
out. I didn’t really want these strangers owning 
the copyrights — and distribution rights — 
of pictures or videos of me on the beach in a 
swimsuit.

In all fairness, those men could have been 

doing any number of things with their camera 
phones. But in my experience, there’s little 
reason to follow the movements of another 
person with your phone unless you’re watching 
them on the screen, trying to keep them in the 
frame.

If they were recording or photographing me 

at that beach, it would have been illegal, but 
only because the beach was privately owned. 
On public property, consent isn’t usually needed 
to photograph a stranger — bikini or no bikini.

***

One summer, I, along with the other students 

in my sports photography class, went to a public 
skate park to practice taking action shots. I 
watched their tricks through my lens, and 
tried to capture them on my memory card. I 
don’t remember if I even thought twice about 
whether the wheeled acrobats appreciated 
their presence in my portfolio.

For a part of the session, I positioned myself 

near one of the chain-link fences. As I attempted 
to photograph the skaters, a little boy came up 
to me and asked through the fence if he could 
take a picture of me for his grandpa. I was taken 
aback, but he held the phone’s camera up to the 
iron as I agreed, probably in a questioning tone. 
He took the picture, walked over to a car, got in 
the passenger seat, and drove off.

I wasn’t thrilled with that particular 

progression of events. But no matter how weird 
I thought the whole thing was, it was still 
perfectly legal. Just as I could photograph the 
athletes, that little boy had a right to take my 
picture and give it to whomever he wanted — 
with or without my approval.

***

In 1890, attorney Samuel Warren and 

Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Louis 
Brandeis 

published “The Right to Privacy” in the Harvard 
Law Review. In it, they argued that individuals 
have a right to keep information about 
themselves to themselves. For several reasons, 
including resurgent newspaper readership and 
innovations in photographic equipment, laws of 
the day were failing to protect personal privacy. 
They argued for more arduous personal privacy 
protection in what became the most cited law 
review article of all time — at least according to 
my Philosophy GSI.

And it’s easy to see why this idea took so 

quickly. For one thing, Americans have a 
long list of personal “rights” that they are 
accustomed to the government protecting on 
their behalf, and the right to privacy seems at 
least as important as our generous exemption 
from quartering troops. Just as it had when the 
article was written, the technology available to 
violate others’ personal privacy rights has again 
changed.

Today, our flimsy laws attempt to provide 

some level of personal privacy. You can’t record 
a private conversation — or interview — without 
the acknowledged consent of each participant. 
It’s illegal to take photos of another person 
without permission — unless they’re taken on 
public property. Yet, a massive percentage of 
people regularly carry phones and cameras 
that can easily — and covertly — do both of 
these things. And when content can be quickly 
uploaded from any computer, photos and videos 
can go viral before their subjects even know 
they were illicitly taken.

Meanwhile, web companies, and allegedly, 

the government, collect vast quantities of data 
about individuals’ computer use. Consumers, 
especially millennials, have grown accustomed 
to the waning privacy of the digital age. We sign 
away privacy rights in exchange for Facebook 
accounts, Google services and a plethora of 
other websites and apps each time we blindly 
agree to one of those online contracts.

The way I see it, we’re at a crossroads. As 

we grow more reliant on digital technology, 
we open more avenues to share information 
— about ourselves and others — that might’ve 
otherwise been private. Consequently, our laws 
grow increasingly difficult to enforce, obsolete 
in their methods and antiquated in terms of 
the content they protect. Certainly, there are 
upsides to diminished privacy — transparency 
being one of them. But, if personal privacy 
is something we continue to value, it needs 
further protection.

Awkward Hozier is 
still breathtaking

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Music Editor

“Musicians should not play 

music. Music should play musi-
cians” – Henry Rollins

At the Royal Oak Music The-

atre this past Saturday, Irish 
singer/songwriter 
Andrew 

Hozier-Byrne, 
performing 

under the name Hozier, fought 
to 
keep 
Rollins’s 
haunting 

words true. Self-described as a 
“gangly introvert,” it isn’t sur-
prising that Hozier doesn’t find 
himself most comfortable in 
front of sold-out crowds who, 
ebullient with praise and appre-
ciation, want nothing more than 
to know everything about him. 

Andrew quietly wandered 

onstage last Saturday night in 
Royal Oak, and with little hesi-
tation began to strum out the 
first chords of “Angel of Small 
Death & The Codeine Scene.” 
And so the night began, fol-
lowing a completely organic, 
un-calculated 
formula 
from 

beginning to end: the immense 
musical 
and 
lyrical 
talents 

that introduced “Take Me to 
Church” to popular culture. 
His overt awkwardness con-
trasted with the cookie-cutter 
star ‘role’ he is supposed to play 
as a highly-sought singer in the 
pop-culture circuit, the figure 
of Andrew Hozier-Byrne is an 
unintentional juxtaposition. 

His lanky six-foot-five-inch 

frame and booming voice com-
pensate for Hozier’s otherwise 
amateurish stage presence. But 
the move from song to song was 
delicate and fluid, moving from 
his opener to his second single 
off Hozier, “From Eden.” 

“Innocence died screaming, 

honey, ask me I should know/I 
slithered here from Eden just to 
sit outside your door” sings all 
the present lips, as if minions to 
this gigantic creature towering 
before us all, mimicking each 
guttural emphasis or passionate 
emphasis the beautiful Irish-
man sings. Lined with depth, 
variety, sensuality and a casual 

biblical reference, the lyrics 
provide a story that is univer-
sally accessible without losing 
its immediacy. 

The music continued with-

out a word from Hozier himself. 
Throwing an electric guitar 
over his shoulder, Andrew and 
his equally talented surround-
ing band descended into one of 
the album’s best, “Jackie and 
Wilson,” singing of a Bonnie-
and-Clyde-sort-of-girl 
who 

builds up a man’s dreams only 
to disappear upon finishing her 
cigarette. And everyone once 
again is singing along and feel-
ing the almost tangible emo-
tion laced through the song and 
it becomes inexplicably clear 
that this man need not talk nor 
describe his talents – he’s just 
here to play. None of that Hol-
lywood, cookie-cutter pop-star 
nonsense here: the music is 
playing this musician. 

But to avoid an influx of nega-

tive 
assumptions 
regarding 

Andrew’s shyness, he does con-
verse with audience by endless-
ly praising their presence and 
support. In a thick Irish accent 
he provides context for his 
next couplet of songs, like the 
experience of “love at its most 
vacuous” that inspired his most 
recent single, “Someone New.” 
Bouncing from a bluesy and folk 
sound as he vacillates between 
an acoustic, electric and steel 
guitar, Mr. Hozier-Byrne estab-
lishes himself and his literary 
lyrics as the constant and the 
music to be the ever-changing, 
ever exciting, but always excel-
lent variable. 

Hozier’s 
choice 
in 
cover 

songs for his Royal Oak perfor-
mance were incredibly indica-
tive, once again, of the immense 

attention he pays on music 
over all else in his occupation. 
His first cover of Skip James’s 
“Illinois Blues” was beauti-
fully jaunting and then per-
fectly juxtaposed by an encore 
presentation of Amerie’s “1 
Thing.” From country blues 
to ’90s pop, Hozier clearly 
adores this music and effec-
tively beckons his audience 
to feel the same, breaking the 
two very different songs down 

for his audience so that they can 
enjoy it too. 

The night ended magically 

as his set’s last song began with 
the staged introduction of a 
couple as a Robert asked for the 
hand in marriage of his now 
fiancé Carey. And with her con-
firmation, and Andrew’s con-
gratulations, the night ended 
ever so sweetly with the deep 
whisper, “In the low lamp light 
I was free/Heaven and Hell 
were words to me.” 

Leaving the concert, it was 

unclear whether Hozier’s star-
dom is sustainable. His current-
ly massive pool of fans wouldn’t 
dissipate for lack of talent, but 
rather perhaps for the critical 
differences Hozier places upon 
himself. Hozier did incred-
ibly well, holding combinations 
of sensuality with pleads of 
social change like those pres-
ent in his largest hit, “Take Me 
to Church.” But awkwardness, 
although at times endearing, 
doesn’t always appeal to the 
masses. 
Hozier’s 
propensity 

for sustained success is held in 
the balance by his next album. 
And maybe this wheat and chaff 
separation is necessary; per-
haps it will act as the opportu-
nity to separate the “Take Me 
to Church” fans from the enam-
ored or obsessed. Nevertheless 
and despite the unknown nature 
of his future, it was invigorat-
ing to witness Rollins’s prolific 
words embodied modernly. 

CONCERT REVIEW

‘Crime’ is arresting

TV REVIEW

Graphic new ABC 

series features 

narrative urgency and 

taut storytelling

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

There’s no shortage of crime 

series 
out 
there 
that 
show 

members of law enforcement 
following 
evidence, 
questioning 
suspects 
and 

chasing 
down 

bad guys before 
ending 
the 

episode 
at 
the 

bar, 
discussing 

what they learned 
that week. 

“American 

Crime” critiques 
these shows through its very 
existence, exploring the idea that 
crime is more than a fantasy —it’s 
a reality faced by actual people 
on a day-to-day basis. Creator 
John Ridley (“12 Years a Slave”) 
doesn’t flinch from showing the 
harsh emotional reality endured 
as a result of violence and crime. 

The 
show 
follows 
the 

aftermath of a home invasion 
which 
leaves 
war-veteran 

Matt 
Skokie 
(Grant 
Merritt, 

“Revolution”) dead and his wife 
Gwen in a critical condition. 
The episode begins with Matt’s 
father, Russ (played by Academy 
Award Winner Timothy Hutton, 
“Leverage”), 
waking 
in 
the 

middle of the night to a phone 
call every parent dreads: asking 
him to fly to Modesto, Calif. to 
identify the body of his son. 

Russ’s reaction to seeing Matt 

in the morgue is a scene shown 
in all the promos, but only when 
watching the episode live is the 
pain truly raw and more real. The 
camera stays focused on Russ 
in a tightly framed close-up of 
him in front of a window with 
blinds drawn – a male voiceover 

narrating, “Someone inside the 
room is gonna pull the blind back. 
You’re gonna see a table with a 
body on it. I need you to tell me if 
the body you see is your son. Let 
me know when you’re ready.” As 
Russ remains fixated on the blind 
yet to be pulled, the camera does 
not move, but stays focused on 
Hutton’s character as he gazes 
absentmindedly at the covered 
glass. The man behind him 
commands, “Go ahead,” and then 
two latex covered hands appear 
on the other side and pull back 
the blind to illuminate Hutton’s 
face. We do not see Matt’s dead 
body – only the impact it has on 
Russ. 

Like 
“Breaking 
Bad,” 

“American Crime” is not for 
the faint of heart. It is a drama 
in the truest sense of the word, 
attacking the nerves — not 
just through graphic images 
of violence but with emotional 
ferocity. 

In style and tone, the show 

feels 
reminiscent 
of 
Steven 

Soderbergh’s 
“Traffic” 
and 

HBO’s “The Wire” as we branch 
off from Russ’s story into the 
other lives drawn into Ridley’s 
web. There’s Felicity Huffman 
(“Desperate Housewives”), who 
plays Matt’s mother and Russ’s 
ex-wife Barb, in a role that is sure 

to put Huffman at the front of the 
Emmy race for Best Supporting 
Actress. 

There’s also Benito Martinez 

(“The Shield” and “Sons of 
Anarchy”) as Alonzo, an overly-
protective 
father 
whose 
son 

Tony — played masterfully by 
newcomer Johnny Ortiz — is 
accidentally implicated in the 
murder 
and 
then 
arrested. 

Another 
newcomer 
is 
Elvis 

Nolasco (“Oldboy”), a drug addict 
in a relationship with the equally 
messed-up Aubrey, played by 
Caitlin 
Gerard 
(“The 
Social 

Network”). Richard Cabral (“The 
Counselor”) rounds out the cast 
as a criminal who may or may 
not have been responsible for 
Skokie’s murder. 

Overall, the real star is John 

Ridley. 
Between 
comedies, 

comic books and the Academy 
Award-winning screenplay for 
“12 Years a Slave,” Ridley can 
now add showrunner to his 
already impressive résumé. With 
“American Crime,” he has built 
an epic tapestry woven with 
emotional 
performances, 
taut 

storytelling and a focus as urgent 
as this morning’s newspapers. 
“American Crime” is one of the 
most engrossing and impressive 
television pilots to be seen in 
quite a long time.

We found love in a hopeless place.

Unfunny ‘Business’

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Music Editor

Following a showdown against 

his more professional, well-
groomed boss, Daniel Trunkman 
(Vince Vaughn, 
“The 
Intern-

ship“) jumps ship 
and launches his 
own 
competing 

firm, called Apex 
International. 
He, joined by a 
clueless, inexperi-
enced interviewee 
(that’s right, not 
even a legitimate hire) (Dave 
Franco, “Now You See Me“) and 
a recently laid-off, sex-crazed old 
man (Tom Wilkinson, “Selma”), 
operates out of a Dunkin’ Donuts, 
and after a full year of dawdling, 
finally manages to snare a deal. 
But until they seal it with the 
ever-important handshake, the 
fate of their firm hangs in limbo. 
They embark on a business trip 
to settle what they assume is 
just a formality, but find, to their 
dismay, the manager of their old 
firm cozying up to their poten-
tial business partner. Every sign 
points in her favor, threatening 
the legitimacy of Apex Interna-
tional. The ragtag group embarks 
on a bumbling wild goose chase 
to regain their edge, and of 
course, hijinks ensue.

But in conjunction with the 

requisite crazy parties and sex is 
a story arc that no one would ever 
think to associate with this breed 
of comedy: responsibility. Daniel 
contends with the challenges 
of parenthood; always too busy 
with work to adequately com-
fort his bullied teenage son and 
misbehaving young daughter. In 
fact, his daughter’s homework 
assignment for him, asking him 
to answer the question “who’s 
your daddy?” acts as the film’s 
main 
narrative 
mechanism. 

Throughout, 
Daniel 
agonizes 

over how to define who he is as a 
person and as a father. Further-
more, as the deal falls increas-
ingly out of Apex’s grasp, Daniel 
feels the pressure to succeed for 

his team, which, no matter how 
grossly incompetent, has always 
remained true to him.

Though it offers a welcome 

interlude from normal slapstick, 
“Unfinished Business” does so 
at the expense of the dumb jokes 
that characterized and popular-
ized the genre. Its promotional 
poster promises two hours of 
depravity with its color-tinted 
party shots of each Apex employ-
ee and the tagline “Best Business 
Trip Ever.” But even with licen-
tious nudity, the finished prod-
uct seems to vacillate between 
hedonism and sentimentality, 
ultimately returning to the latter. 
In fact, the driving force behind 
the main plotline grounds it in 
realistic adult concerns. After a 
disturbingly graphic gay fetish 
scene that finds Daniel witness 
to their business partner’s exhi-
bitionist side and the film’s sub-
sequent, and only, rave montage, 
the two men commiserate over 
their midlife crises. Are Vince 
Vaughn movies finally growing 
up?

It might be a nice balance if 

the funny parts were actually 
funny. Only Franco’s character, 
in all his blind optimism and 
shocking stupidity, stands out. 
Even then, the running joke sur-
rounding his name – Mike Pan-
cake – warrants no more than a 
smirk at best and gets dragged 
out far longer than it should. The 
rest of the gags are staid and lack 
the incendiary spark to actually 
succeed.

If this is to be a continuing 

trend in comedy, then there’s 
still more work to be done to 
meld seriousness and silliness 
together. Otherwise, we’re bet-
ter off saving the histrionics for 
another fight.

‘Sea’ more than plot

FILM REVIEW

What it lacks in 

storytelling, “Song of 
the Sea” makes up for 

emotion

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

For The Daily

“Song of the Sea” may suffer 

in storytelling, but it certainly 
prospers at crafting an emotional 
tale. While other Oscar-nominated 
animated 
features 
of 

2014 
delighted 

in 
superhero 

comedy 
(“Big 

Hero 
6”) 
and 

dragon-hunting 
action 
(“How 

to 
Train 
Your 

Dragon 2”), and 
still others explored new ways of 
animating (“The Tale of Princess 
Kaguya”), “Song of the Sea” is a 
simple tale about loss and closure.

Like director Tomm Moore’s 

first animated feature, the Oscar-
nominated “The Secret of Kells,” 
“Song of the Sea” delves into 
Irish 
mythology. 
Newcomer 

Lucy O’Connell plays Saoirse, a 
six-year-old girl who has never 
spoken a word in her life. Saoirse’s 
older brother, Ben (David Rawle, 
“Moone Boy”) and her widowed 
father, Conor (Brendan Gleeson, 
“Edge of Tomorrow”) don’t realize 
that like her late mother, Saoirse is 
a selkie — a human who turns into 
a seal when it enters the water.

The film opens with an elegant 

first act portraying the profound 
effect the death of Bronagh (Lisa 
Hannigan, known for her career 
as a singer-songwriter) has had on 
her family. Conor spends nights 
depressed at the pub while Ben 
bullies Saoirse, clearly blaming 
her for Bronagh’s death. One 
night, Ben and Saoirse’s babysitter 
granny (Fionnula Flanagan, “Yes 
Man”) finds Saoirse asleep on 
the beach. Declaring their island 

home unsafe, Granny takes the 
children with her to her house on 
the mainland, leaving Conor to 
grieve alone with their sheepdog, 
Cú.

Despite the film’s emotional 

core, “Song of the Sea” struggles at 
crafting an original story. Behind 
the creative mythological touches, 
much of the film’s story relies on 
another MacGuffin: a “selkie coat” 
that Saoirse must find to save a race 
of fairies from an evil owl witch 
named Macha. The second act of 
the film includes some playful, 
amusing new characters, but it’s 
not as interesting as the genuine 
emotion of the beginning. Saoirse 
wants to go home to find the coat, 
and Ben just wants to see Cú, but 
neither of these motivations are 
strong enough to power the story. 
Ultimately, the plot just feels 
formulaic.

It 
doesn’t 
help 
that 
the 

animation is hardly spectacular in 
the middle section of the film. The 
opening and closing acts are full of 
rich hand-painted backgrounds, 
from the swirling blues of the sea 
to the muted grays and greens of 
the sky, but the second act puts 
an emphasis on the characters’ 
faces, which are flat and simplistic. 
This traditional style fits the film, 

but it doesn’t allow for additional 
excitement in the middle parts. 
The film also mostly stays away 
from humor, aside from some light 
touches, like Ben going to the pain 
of vaulting a fence when the gate is 
already unlocked.

Still, the film never reaches 

slog status, and it’s all worth 
it for what it builds to. Macha, 
also voiced by Flanagan, is a 
surprisingly tragic character, an 
antagonist who takes away all 
emotions in an effort to eliminate 
suffering from the world. Her 
wide owl eyes suggest painful 
scars from her past, and the film 
meditates on whether happy 
moments are worth it with all 
the sad moments that come with 
them.

The film finally comes together 

with a beautiful, awe-inspiring 
ending that makes excellent 
use of composer Bruno Coulais 
and Irish band Kíla’s passionate 
score. Ben is forced to confront 
his misplaced resentment for his 
sister, and Conor must move past 
his anguish to be the father Ben 
and Saoirse need. The film may be 
a bit of a slow burn when it comes 
to plot, but when the payoff is this 
affecting, something as trivial as 
plot is insignificant.

‘Carter’ ends first 
season on heroic note

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

God bless Marvel and all 

the beautiful people who made 
“Agent Carter” possible. In 
eight episodes, 
“Agent Carter” 
told a tight, 
fun and highly 
engrossing spy 
story that tied 
cleverly 
into 

the 
Marvel 

Cinematic 
Universe 
without 
pandering 
to 
its 

audience. 

If 
anything, 
“Agent 

Carter” ’s first season finale, 
“Valediction,” 
is 
about 

moving beyond the memory 
of 
Captain 
America 
(Chris 

Evans, “Snowpiercer”) and the 
reductive version of the World 
War II era he represents. No 
scene embodies this more than 
when Peggy (Hayley Atwell, 
“Black Mirror”) prevents a 
hypnotized 
Howard 
Stark 

(Dominic 
Cooper, 
“Captain 

America: The First Avenger”) 
from 
releasing 
the 
deadly 

insanity gas, Midnight Oil, 
onto Time Square. 

As Stark believes he’s flying 

a plane into Antarctica to save 
Cap, Carter must convince 
him that Rogers is dead and 
he’s never coming back. Atwell 
really sells the devastation 
and loss felt not only by 
her character, but all of the 
characters. It also reminds the 
viewer that, although we know 
Cap is just taking an icy nap, 
Peggy and company need to 
believe wholeheartedly that he 
is dead and that they must move 
on with their own lives. 

It is also nice seeing “One 

Tree Hill” star Chad Michael 
Murray as Agent Thompson, 
still a sleazebag at the end of 
the episode. Even if the male 
Agents came off as clichéd 
misogynists in the pilot, the 
actors and writers delivered 
increasingly poignant moments 
which made us care about 
them despite their flaws — 
especially 
in 
the 
previous 

episode where Shea Whigham 
(“Boardwalk 
Empire”) 

delivered an outstanding final 
performance as Chief Dooley, 
a character who developed 
from one-dimensional to tragic 
hero. We begin with the Agent 
recovering from his sacrifice 
and the gruesome attack at 
the theater. Viewers might 
have been a little unsure about 
how daring a show like “Agent 
Carter” could be on network 
television, but while it’s far 
away from “Hannibal,” it still 
provides much of the grit 
necessary to tell the story of the 
MCU’s forgotten past. 

But, 
in 
classic 
Marvel 

tradition, 
“Agent 
Carter” 

magically balances its tone 
between dark and hysterical. 
Howard Stark is particularly 
amusing 
during 
the 
press-

conference 
with 
Agent 

Thompson. Let’s hope Cooper 
becomes a series regular moving 

forward. Edwin Jarvis (James 
D’Arcy, “Jupiter Ascending”) 
continues to prove a most loyal 
and charming companion for 
Carter, though it’s unclear how 
often his surprisingly eventful 
past will pop up in convenient 
ways, such as it does when he 
flies a plane at the end. 

There are a few loose ends 

that 
might 
disappoint 
fans 

who expect this to be the final 
episode of the series. To wit, 
we still don’t know everything 
about Leviathan, the supposed 
main threat of the series. Its 
members, Fennhoff and Dottie 
(Bridget 
Regan, 
“Jane 
the 

Virgin”), prove to be interesting 
enough characters. Yet, their 
motivation is still quite cloudy. 
Their final confrontation with 
Carter and company come off too 
much like a Bond villain’s — and 
not in a positive way, as Dottie’s 
escape is too predictable. That 
being said, she is excellent when 
she interrogates Howard, whom 
she forced to recollect names 
she gave him in the past. 

The 
appearance 
of 
Toby 

Jones 
(“Captain 
America: 

The Winter Soldier”) at the 
end, reprising his role as Dr. 
Arnim Zola, will also please 
fans of “The Winter Soldier.” 
However, Fennhoff — wearing 
an awesome Hannibal Lecter-
esque mask in the final scene — 
proves to be far more than just a 
one-note super-villain. We just 
really hope he doesn’t become 
HYDRA henchman number 37. 

Nevertheless, all of these 

minor gripes don’t get in the 
way of “Agent Carter” pulling 
off a great season finale to 
an engrossing series. Here’s 
hoping the hard work of “Agent 
Carter” ’s cast and crew does 
not go unnoticed.

Bielfeldt basks in Senior Day spotlight, 

posts first career double-double

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Max Bielfeldt’s tenure in Ann Arbor has spanned one of the 

Michigan men’s basketball team’s most successful four-year 
stretches ever, however minimal or understated his role in that 
success has been.

The Wolverines reached the National Championship Game in his 

sophomore season and returned to the Elite Eight his junior year, 
the year Michigan won its first outright regular-season Big Ten 
championship since 1986. Five of Bielfeldt’s Michigan teammates 
have been selected in the NBA Draft, with more on their way.

But while the senior forward certainly had his in-game moments, 

many of his contributions to the Wolverines’ success took place 
behind the scenes — on the practice court or in the locker room, as 
a member of the scout team or as a leader. He was one of Michigan’s 
only upperclassmen in his final two seasons.

“He’s been such a good scout team player, but he’s had guys 

named McGary, Horford and Morgan playing in front of him all this 
time,” said Michigan coach John 

Series of career highs leads Michigan to 

victory over Rutgers

By DANIEL FELDMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Perhaps it was the magic of Senior Day. Perhaps it was the release 

of pent-up frustration after losing a double-overtime heartbreaker 
to Northwestern earlier in the week. Or, perhaps it was because the 
Michigan men’s basketball team was playing Rutgers, loser of 13 
straight games.

Maybe it was combination of all three, as the Wolverines (8-10 

Big Ten, 15-15 overall) dominated the Scarlet Knights on Saturday at 
Crisler Center, winning 79-69.

“I saw our older guys, (senior forward Max Bielfeldt and sophomore 

forward Zak Irvin), they were really disappointed and showed it,” 
said Michigan coach John Beilein about the Northwestern loss during 
the week. “And the coaches, we all felt it, but we didn’t show it. We 
thought it was a really important time in our program that our young 
guys not get down after what was as difficult a loss as any Michigan 
team has had.”

And so, in Bielfeldt’s final home contest in a Michigan uniform, the 

Wolverines went to the senior right away, giving the ball to him down 

low before he scored on a right-handed hook shot to open up the day’s 
scoring.

And while Rutgers (2-16, 10-21) answered, making five of its first 

seven shots, Michigan’s offense was too much the rest of the first half 
and the rest of the way.

First it was freshman forward Aubrey Dawkins, who scored eight of 

Michigan’s first 11 points. Dawkins made four first-half triples to lead 
the Wolverines with 14 points.

He had plenty more, though. He finished with a career-high 31 

points along with eight triples, tying Glen Rice for second-most in a 
Michigan game.

“My shot was feeling good at warm-up and every game I’m told to 

shoot the ball if I’m open, so I let it go,” Dawkins said. “Once I made 
the first one, I’ve got to shoot the second one. (And if I make the second 
one,) I keep going with it.”

Dawkins wasn’t the only hot hand, though. Off the bench, freshman 

forward Kameron Chatman contributed 11 points, including three 
3-pointers in the first half — the final coming in the final seconds of 
the stanza to give Michigan a 47-28 lead. He would ultimately finish 
with a new career high of 13 points.

Caught in the middle of the two freshmen was Bielfeldt. After scoring 

the first basket of the contest, he was a force near the basket, making 
five first-half field goals to tally 10 points to go along with six rebounds 
and three assists, which broke his previous career high of two. Bielfeldt 
would end the day 

KNIGHTED?

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
A fitting gesture to close an unusual year
A

fter Saturday’s game 
against Rutgers, Jon 
Rubenstein stood near 

the glass doors of the Crisler 
Center media room, surrounded 
by friends 
and family.

The 

freshman 
guard didn’t 
stand out 
from the 
pack — at 
5-foot-8, he 
rarely does — 
save for the 
game-worn 
uniform and 
a smile that wouldn’t leave his 
face.

A reporter approached him, 

and a family member pulled 
out a camera to document the 
occurrence. Rubenstein rarely 
gets interviewed, much less 
recognized, for his contributions 
to the Michigan men’s basketball 
team. But on this afternoon, a 
handful of journalists stopped 
talking to Aubrey Dawkins and 
Max Bielfeldt — who tallied 
31 points and a double-double, 
respectively — to speak with 
him instead.

On the way out, Rubenstein’s 

family searched the room for 
extra stat packets, scanning the 
first page and then smiling.

Before Rubenstein was 

escorted out of the room, he was 
stopped by a fan.

“You did something I never 

did — got on the court for a 
college game,” the stranger said. 
“Congratulations!”

* * *

B

efore Saturday, Ruben-
stein and freshman Ryan 
Kapustka worked what 

had largely been a thankless job. 
They weren’t on scholarship, 
and they didn’t get any media 
recognition for their duties.

That’s because both 

were team managers for 
the Wolverines, handling 
equipment, setting up drills 
and ensuring practices ran as 
smoothly as possible.

For Rubenstein, who had 

received minimal collegiate 
interest for his basketball 
abilities, the job was a way to 
“stay in touch with the game I 
love.” He and Kapustka played 
pickup games with the other 
team managers, and the two 
former high-school varsity 
athletes stood out among their 
peers.

But until Caris LeVert, 

Derrick Walton Jr. and D.J. 
Wilson all went down with 
injuries, that was only good 
for bragging rights. When the 
Wolverines needed more players 

to fill in on the scout team, 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
turned to the two freshmen 
who already had an in with the 
program.

“I like to think that I can 

hold my own out there,” 
Rubenstein said. “They put us 
in a couple scrimmages, and 
I don’t necessarily put up big 
numbers in those, but I’m out 
there.”

In late February, Beilein told 

Rubenstein and Kapustka he 
wanted them to dress for the 
regular-season finale against 
Rutgers. That meant both got 
to warm up in a game uniform 
adorned with their name and sit 
on the bench.

“They didn’t have to do that at 

all,” Rubenstein said.

He called his parents, his 

high-school coach and his best 
friend James.

Then he began to dream of 

playing.

* * *

N

ow they have pages on 
ESPN.com, Rubenstein 
and Kapustka. They’re 

the bare minimum — just a 
name, height, hometown and 
position beside a yellow block 
“M” — but they exist nonethe-
less.

That’s because both 

officially logged a minute in 
the Wolverines’ 79-69 win over 
Rutgers. Rubenstein even shot a 
free throw, missing the front end 
of a one-and-one in the closing 

seconds.

“It’s surreal, it’s fun, it’s 

crazy, it’s emotional, it’s nerve-
wracking,” he said. “It’s all those 
words. It was a dream come 
true, absolutely.

“It’s a dream come true to 

put this uniform on, to hear the 
announcer and the fans. It’s 
everything you dream as a little 
kid.”

While this season hasn’t 

lived up to expectations, it 
has provided Rubenstein and 
Kapustka a day they never 
thought possible.

You may already be 

looking ahead to 2015-16, 
when Michigan returns the 
conference’s hottest shooter 
(Dawkins), its most improbably 
good player (Albrecht) and a 

healthy Walton. It’s shaping 
up to be quite the return to 
prominence for the program, 
which will have experience 
across the board — and a 
formidable amount of depth at 
guard if LeVert returns.

It’ll also mean Rubenstein and 

Kapustka will return to their 
duties as team managers. No 
more uniform, no more warmup 
drills, no more possibilities of 
playing time.

But their stat lines will 

be permanently archived in 
Michigan’s record books.

* * *

A

fter Rubenstein and 
Kapustka had left the 
media room, Beilein 

stepped to the podium for his 
postgame press conference.

“This was a very unique year,” 

the coach said, “and a unique 
way to finish it.”

It was, wasn’t it?
Few expected guard 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman to star as a 
freshman, and virtually no one 
thought Andrew Dakich and 
Sean Lonergan would earn 
meaningful minutes in Big Ten 
games. That’s about as strange 
as you can get — but it got even 
more bizarre Saturday, as a pair 
of former team managers closed 
out a conference win.

After such a tumultuous 

regular season, it was one last 
positive surprise.

“I said to Jon as he was 

going to the locker room 
after the warmup, before the 
game: ‘What was it like down 
there?’ And he said, ‘That was 
amazing,’ ” Beilein recalled. 
“And that sort of just took me, 
and I said, ‘Boy, that was the 
right thing to do.’ ”

MSU ends ‘M’ tourney hopes

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Writer

HOFFMAN 
ESTATES, 
Ill. 

— In each of its two previous 
matchups with Michigan State 
this 
season, 
the 
Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team 
pulled off 
convincing victories on the 
strength of stellar defense and 
efficient shooting.

But 
in 
their 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament 
opener 
against 

the Spartans on Thursday, the 
Wolverines struggled early in 
both areas.

After 
neutralizing 
every 

Michigan State threat except 
forward Aerial Powers in the 
first two games, Michigan’s 
defense allowed four Spartans to 
reach double figures in scoring. 
The Wolverines’ offense missed 
its 
first 
10 
3-pointers 
and 

finished the game with a 16.7 
shooting percentage beyond the 
arc.

Sparked by an early eight 

points from forward Becca 
Mills, Michigan State opened 
the game on a 19-4 run, and 
Michigan was unable to fight 
its way out of the early hole. 
Led by Powers’ double-double 
(16 points, 15 rebounds), the 
Spartans pulled away with 
a 69-49 victory, eliminating 
the Wolverines from the Big 
Ten Tournament for the third 
straight year.

“Michigan State was fired 

up 
about 
losing 
the 
first 

two contests because that’s 
something 
that 
they’re 
not 

really accustomed to doing,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes Arico. “I’m sure they 
were ready to go. They really 
played well tonight. They shot 
the basketball extremely well. 
We didn’t.”

Michigan State completely 

dominated the paint, holding 
senior forward and second-
team 
All-Big 
Ten 
selection 

Cyesha Goree to five points on 
2-for-13 shooting.

The Spartans’ defense left 

Goree looking visibly frustrated 
throughout the contest — she 

only made one of her six free 
throw attempts and looked 
incredulous 
after 
she 
was 

blocked on a fast-break attempt 
to end the first half.

“She 
missed 
uncontested 

shots, contested shots, free 
throws ... I mean, she seemed 
to miss every opportunity that 
she was getting,” Barnes Arico 
said. “And it’s kind of a bummer 
for her to have that as a senior 
against Michigan State tonight. 
But she’s had such a tremendous 
season for us this year, I don’t 
want this to take away from 
the year that she’s had for our 
team.”

To 
compensate 
for 
its 

struggles in the post, Michigan 
turned its attention beyond 
the arc and found no success 
there, either. Even when their 
guards 
found 
open 
looks, 

nothing seemed to fall for the 
Wolverines.

No 
Michigan 
player 

connected from long range until 
junior guard Madison Ristovski 
hit a triple with 1:54 remaining 
in the first half. Sophomore 
guard Siera Thompson made 
only one of her eight 3-point 
attempts, and freshman guard 
Katelynn Flaherty finished just 
2-for-8.

The 
Wolverines’ 
shooters 

quickly became frustrated, and 
they let it show even when they 
didn’t have possession of the 
ball.

“When we put our scorers 

in, they were giving up points 
on the defensive end, and they 
weren’t making shots tonight,” 
Barnes Arico said. “So that’s 
what kind of dug us a little bit 
more of a hole. I think Katelynn 
— she does get super frustrated 
and she believes that if she’s 
not making shots, she’s not 
contributing.”

The Spartans, on the other 

hand, used a solid shooting 
performance 
to 
maintain 
a 

20-point lead for most of the 
game. Guard Lexi Gussert made 
her first five shots, including four 
3-pointers, before she finally 
missed for the first time midway 
through the second half.

Barnes Arico made a few 

adjustments to try to remedy 
the team’s struggles — she 
frequently rotated her shooters 
and even subbed in junior 
forward Kelsey Mitchell for 
some extra defensive help — 
but nothing Michigan tried 
could slow Michigan State’s 
momentum.

The loss quelled any chance of 

an at-large NCAA Tournament 
bid for the Wolverines, and it 
denied Michigan a chance to 
complete a three-game sweep of 
their in-state rival for the first 
time in history.

Michigan continues 
success in California

By MITCH BECKMAN

Daily Sports Writer

It’s 
pretty 
obvious 
that 

California has been good to the 
Wolverines.

Last season, three of the 

Michigan 
women’s 
lacrosse 

team’s four wins came against 
California opponents — UC 
Davis, California and Fresno 
State. 
Friday, 
they 
followed 
up 
another 
victory 
against 

California with a 22-8 win over 
St. Mary’s. The win is the team’s 
third in a row, and it puts the 
program above .500 for the first 
time in its young history.

Just three days after their 

16-14 win over California, the 
Wolverines showed no signs of 
fatigue.

Sophomore 
attackers 
Jess 

Angerman and Tess Korten 
each recorded 
hat tricks in 
the first half 
alone, giving 
Michigan 
a 
12-6 
lead 

at 
halftime. 

Angerman 
ended 
the 

game 
with 

three 
goals 

and 
two 

assists, and Korten finished 
with four goals and an assist.

The offense spread the wealth 

in the second half and ran away 
on the scoreboard. Freshman 
attacker Mae Tarr added four 
goals in the second stanza 
after scoring one in the first 
half, leading all Wolverines on 
the score sheet with six points 
on seven shots. Nine different 
players found the back of the 
net, and six of the nine players 
registered multiple points in the 
program’s largest scoring total 
to date.

“It was a product of the whole 

team,” Tarr said. “We moved 
the ball well and really played as 
a team. I think the whole team 
contributed to the 22 goals.”

For the third consecutive 

game, the Wolverines won 
the possession battle. Going 
17-for-18 on clears bolstered 
the offense, while dominance 
in 
the 
faceoff 
dot, 
where 

Michigan won 21 of 32, kept the 
Gaels’ offense from mounting a 
comeback and kept the attack 
coming on the offensive end. 
The Wolverines also won the 
ground-ball battle, beating the 
Gaels, 23-15.

“It all started with draw 

control,” Tarr said. “From there, 
we just executed on offense. 
And the defense got a lot of 
turnovers and (moved the) ball 
up field as well, and that really 
let us succeed.”

Along with controlling the 

faceoff dot, Michigan’s strong 
defensive performance gave the 
offense ample opportunities, 
most of which they converted. 
Sophomore 
goalie 
Allison 

Silber made six saves, and the 

defense 
in 

front of her 
turned 
out 

one of their 
strongest 
performances 
of the season, 
constantly 
pestering the 
St. 
Mary’s 

offense. 
The 
Gaels 

attempted just 16 shots while 
the Wolverines attempted 35.

“I don’t think we were 

aggressive enough in the first 
half,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 

Jennifer Ulehla. “In the second 
half we came out and were much 
more aggressive on the ball, and 
I liked the adjustment we made.”

While 
the 
on-the-field 

performance 
was 
certainly 

impressive, its context makes 
it even more so. The wins 
come during Spring Break, a 
time notoriously difficult for 
anyone to focus. Last season, 
the team had two tough losses 
in Florida. This year, the extra 
year of experience showed and 
the Wolverines left California 
victorious.

Brown attack too much for 
Wolverines at Oosterbaan

By SHAWN HEROOR

Daily Sports Writer

It was a game of runs for the 

Michigan men’s lacrosse team 
Sunday afternoon, and none of 
them went in the Wolverines’ 
favor.

Buoyed by three 5-0 runs 

through the game, Brown (4-0) 
hammered the Wolverines, 22-12, 
at Oosterbaan Fieldhouse.

The 
Bears’ 
high-powered 

attack, scoring more than 17 goals 
per game coming into Sunday, 
was on full display. It was led by 
sophomore attacker Dylan Molloy, 
who notched eight goals on the 
afternoon. Molloy, who currently 
leads the country with 6.5 goals 
per game, added five assists.

Without leading scorer Ian 

King, Michigan (3-3) was led by 
his replacement, junior attacker 
Peter Kraus. Kraus had three 
goals and two assists in his first 
start of the season.

Brown started its scoring 

onslaught quickly, jumping out 
to a 5-0 lead in the first quarter. 
Michigan was able to cut the 
deficit to 5-2 going into the first 
break on goals from Kraus and 
junior midfielder Kyle Jackson. 
The Wolverines were outshot 
17-10 in the first stanza.

“I didn’t like the way we came 

out and competed,” said Michigan 
coach John Paul. “We weren’t 
really competing, and that killed 
us during the first half.”

The Wolverines opened the 

second quarter with another goal 
from Jackson, who took a perfect 
feed from senior attacker David 
McCormack and buried a shot 
past the Brown goalie. However, 
the Bears went on another 5-0 
run to jump out to a 10-3 lead. The 
run included three goals scored 
directly off of faceoffs.

The Wolverines were 
just 

15-for-38 on faceoffs on the day, 
with regular faceoff man Brad 

Lott going just 5-for-14. Lott was 
replaced by freshman Michael 
McDonnell midway through the 
second.

“We’re just not getting ground 

balls, it’s not just Brad and 
Mike,” Paul said. “It was a big 
factor in the first half, not having 
possession because we weren’t 
getting ground balls.”

Michigan was able to cut the 

deficit to five with goals from 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Mikie 

Schlosser and senior attacker 
Mike Francia, but goals from 
Molloy and Henry Blynn gave 
the Bears a 12-5 lead at halftime.

Kraus opened the scoring in 

the third quarter with a quick goal 
before redshirt junior midfielder 
David Joseph beat Brown goalie 
Jack Kelly to a ground ball and 
fired a shot into the empty net to 
put the deficit at 12-7.

Redshirt sophomore defender 

Charlie Keady made the game 

12-8 after catching Kelly napping 
on defense, firing a shot from 
behind the center circle. It was 
Michigan’s first goal from a 
defenseman this season.

The Bears and Wolverines 

exchanged four goals each in the 
rest of the third quarter, before 
Brown attacker Tim Jacob netted 
one with just eight seconds left in 
the third, giving the Bears a 16-11 
advantage heading into the final 
stanza.

“The second half, we finished 

a couple plays, but more than 
anything, we won a couple 
faceoffs and we picked up a few 
ground balls,” Paul said. “If 
(Jacob) doesn’t get that goal at 
the end, we’re right back in the 
game.”

Brown’s final run to start 

the fourth put the game away. 
Molloy scored three goals in two 
minutes, as the Bears jumped out 
to a 20-11 lead. Kraus added his 

third goal with 9:33 remaining in 
the match, before Molloy scored 
the final two to give Brown the 
22-12 win.

“Brown’s a great team. They’re 

great in transition, give them a lot 
of credit,” said Michigan senior 
defenseman Mack Gembis. “We 
didn’t limit their posessions, and 
a team like that is gonna get a lot 
of good looks.”

After 
the 
game, 
Gembis 

emphasized that the Wolverines 
have to have a short memory, 
especially with the conference 
season rapidly approaching.

“Our (conference) season is in 

front of us, we’re 0-0,” Gembis 
said. “We’ve got to get better 
from our mistakes.”

The Wolverines may have 

a clean slate heading into the 
conference season, but if they 
can’t fix their defensive woes, 
then the Big Ten season may lead 
to more of the same.

‘M’ struggling with 
transition defense

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

When Michigan coach John 

Paul decided to install a new 
offense at the beginning of the 
season for the men’s lacrosse 
team, he knew he was taking a 
risk.

While the Wolverines’ new 

scheme may be paying dividends 
for Michigan’s attack – the team 
scores 12 goals per game – a more 
aggressive midfield leaves the 
Wolverines’ defense vulnerable 
to opponents’ transition attacks.

Paul knew an up-tempo attack 

could cause problems for the 
Wolverines. So when Brown 
(4-0), the No. 2 scoring offense 
in the nation, paid a visit to 
Oosterbaan Fieldhouse on Sun-
day, Michigan’s defense couldn’t 
keep up with the speedy Bears in 
a 22-12 defeat.

“There’s no one in lacrosse 

playing at the speed (Brown’s) 
playing at right now,” Paul said.

Brown’s unique offense was 

problematic for the Wolverines 
from the start. The Bears’ “run-
and-gun” style caught Michigan 
(3-3) by surprise as the Wolver-
ines wanted to slow the game 
down, but after his team gave up 
the first five goals, Paul knew his 
strategy needed to change.

Michigan’s faceoff man and 

midfield lines were both changed 
over the course of the first half, 
but that couldn’t stop Brown’s 
constant waves of attack.

“Our initial game plan was 

to slow everything down, and 
we didn’t do a good job of that,” 
Paul said. “Once we got behind 
it didn’t make sense to do that. 
After halftime, we just told the 
boys to go.”

Paul continued to tinker, and 

he wanted to see his team pick 
up the pace. The Wolverines out-
scored Brown in the third quar-
ter, 6-4, as halftime adjustments 

were beneficial to Michigan as it 
nearly dug itself out of a seven-
goal deficit.

“We were going to come out 

(in the second half) hard and fast 
and try to narrow the score a lit-
tle bit,” said redshirt junior mid-
fielder David Joseph. “We got in 
our motion offense, and moved 
the ball well and finished, too.”

The Wolverines quickened 

the pace, picked up more ground 
balls and made plays that built 
confidence and momentum in 
the young team.

But before Michigan made 

adjustments in the midfield, 
which included increased play-
ing time for quick players such 
as freshman Chase Young and 
junior Riley Kennedy, the glaring 
problem of a midfield that strug-
gled to move the ball and stop the 
Bears from pushing the tempo 
remained.

The main factor missing from 

Michigan’s game was urgency, 
especially in forcing turnovers 
and keeping possession. Picking 
up groundballs was especially 
problematic for the Wolverines 
in the first half, as Brown out-
gained them 28-19.

“We were throwing the ball 

away unforced,” Paul said. “A 
lot of the turnovers they caused 
were in the middle of the field 
because whenever we picked a 
groundball up they’d check it 
right back out.”

Michigan took chances across 

the field Sunday and got pun-
ished for playing into its oppo-
nents’ hands. A conservative 
approach to transition defense, 
an issue the Wolverines knew 
they were going to have, doomed 
the team from the start.

“We’re close,” Joseph said. 

“We did make some good plays 
today, hustled and never gave up. 
We’ll practice hard, learn from 
the mistakes today and make up 
for it in future games.”

MEN’S LACROSSE

with his first career double-double, 
putting up 14 points and a career-
high 11 rebounds.

“You’ve got to have a little extra 

pep in your step when they’ve got 
your framed jersey, everyone’s 
clapping 
for 
you, 
everyone’s 

concentrating on what you’re 
doing,” Bielfeldt said. “It’s a little 
extra energy.”

While the trio contributed most 

of the Wolverines’ scoring in the 
first half, it was truly a team effort 
as Michigan dished out 13 assists 
against only one turnover in the 

first 20 minutes.

Though the victory doesn’t 

match the feeling of last year’s 
Senior 
Day, 

when Michigan 
defeated 
Indiana before 
holding 
an 

on-court 
net-

cutting 
and 

celebration 
to 
mark 
the 

team’s 
Big 

Ten 
regular-

season title, it 
could still be 
important.

The Wolverines will enter the 

Big Ten Tournament as the No. 

9 seed. To have any chance of 
a NCAA Tournament bid, they 
will have to win the tournament 

to 
clinch 
an 

automatic 
berth.

After 

the 
team’s 

performance 
against 
Rutgers, 
Beilein believes 
Michigan 
has “a chance 
against 
everybody.”

And if his team plays like it 

did Saturday, it will have an even 
better chance.

MICHIGAN
From Page 1B

“If I made the 
first one, I’ve 

got to shoot the 

second one.”

Beilein. “So it’s been difficult for 
him to get out there.”

It was fitting, then, that in the 

Wolverines’ 79-69 victory over 
Rutgers on Saturday, Bielfeldt 
finally had the chance to enjoy 
the spotlight for a few moments, 
crossing off many bucket-list 
career items in the process.

He made his first career start 

in place of freshman forward 
Ricky Doyle, who was sidelined 
by an intestinal virus. Even if 
Doyle had been healthy, Beilein 
said Friday that Bielfeldt would 
have gotten the start.

After a brief, understated 

pregame ceremony in which 
Bielfeldt and his parents were 
honored at midcourt next to a 
framed No. 44 maize jersey, the 
man known to his teammates as 
“Moose” started out hot.

Bielfeldt began the game 

by pulling down a rebound 
on Michigan’s first defensive 
possession, and he scored the 
first points of the game on the 
ensuing sequence with a smooth 
right-handed hook shot.

“Once that first basket went 

down, all the pressure is kind of 
off my shoulders,” Bielfeldt said. 
“I’m glad that first one went 
down, so I could do some other 
things with my game.”

Bielfeldt 

never let his 
foot off the 
gas pedal, and 
finished with 
his first career 
double-double 
in 
his 
67th 

game played, 
recording 
14 

points and 11 
rebounds.

Beilein 

didn’t 
seem 
surprised 
by 

Bielfeldt’s 
performance, 

recalling 
that 
in 
light 
of 

Michigan’s 
heartbreaking, 

double-overtime 
loss 
to 

Northwestern on Tuesday, he 
saw 
exceptional 
enthusiasm 

in practice from Michigan’s 
veterans 
— 
particularly 

Bielfeldt, junior guard Spike 
Albrecht and sophomore guard 
Zak Irvin.

“If you do the right things, 

and you have high character, 
and you just keep working and 
working and working, getting 
through all these injuries, good 

things can happen to good 
people,” Beilein said. “That 
showed today.”

The milestone could have 

snuck up on Bielfeldt, he said, 

if it weren’t 
for 
some 

interjections 
from 
the 

bench.

“My 

teammates 
were 
very 

adamant 
about 
telling 

me,” Bielfeldt 
said. “I’d look 
over 
to 
the 

bench to look for a play, and 
you’d have (junior guard Caris 
LeVert) and the bench telling 
me, “Two more!’ ”

The fans in attendance at 

Crisler Center were just as 
aware as the bench, if not more 
so. Though no announcement 
was made and no graphics 
were shown on the scoreboard, 
Bielfeldt’s 
ninth 
rebound 

generated a buzz throughout 
Crisler, a buzz that turned to a 
roar once he secured his 10th.

“It’s 
awesome,” 
said 

freshman 
guard 
Aubrey 

Dawkins. “I’m happy for him. 
The team’s happy for him. 
The fans are happy for him. 
It shows. He has so much 
appreciation for the program, 
and you’ve got to love him.”

Michigan’s NCAA Tournament 
hopes take a hit in State College

By ERIN LENNON

Daily Sports Editor

STATE COLLEGE — With 

six minutes remaining in the 
second period Saturday, a pileup 
in the Penn State crease ended 
in a skate-
induced 
hole, 
forcing 
Pegula Ice Arena staff to switch 
out the nets.

It was a game of pileups 

and penalties, but after three 
frustrating periods of hockey, 
the No. 16 Michigan hockey 
team failed to finish its chances 
for a second straight game. The 
Wolverines suffered their third 
loss of the season to the Nittany 
Lions, 4-3.

With 
just 
four 
seconds 

remaining in regulation, yet 
another pileup resulted in what 
looked 
like 
the 
Wolverines’ 

game-tying goal. But after a 
referee waved his arms and the 
tally was reviewed, the goal came 
off the board.

Following its fifth straight 

road loss, Michigan will need 
to win the Big Ten Tournament 
to secure an automatic berth to 
the NCAA Tournament. It also 
puts the Wolverines’ hopes of a 
first-round bye in the conference 
tournament at risk, meaning even 
one loss to Michigan State in the 
final regular-season series could 
be detrimental.

“There’s 
always 
pressure, 

but we want to make the 
tournament,” said sophomore 
forward JT Compher. “Everyone 
in the room wants to make the 
tournament. But we can’t think 
about it.”

Unable to get much of anything 

going through the first half of 
the final frame, the Wolverines 
were forced to play the remaining 
minutes 
without 
freshman 

forward 
Dylan 
Larkin, 
who 

received a 10-minute misconduct 

at the midway point.

After that, Michigan was 

simply unlucky.

With 
5:15 
remaining 
in 

regulation, sophomore forward 
Tyler Motte set up junior Boo 
Nieves, whose shot deflected high 
above the net. At the 4:56 mark, 
sophomore forward Alex Kile’s 
shot clanged off the goalpost.

The struggle forced Michigan 

coach Red Berenson to call a 
timeout, pull goaltender Steve 
Racine and put Michigan on 
the 6-on-5 advantage for the 
remaining 3:26. And though the 
move allowed the Wolverines 
to pull within one goal on JT 
Compher’s 
hat 
trick-earning 

goal, it was too little, too late.

“I’ve been playing some of my 

better hockey,” Compher said. 
“Unfortunately, the team hasn’t 
been. These two losses hurt a lot.”

Despite allowing six goals in 

his fifth straight start Friday, 
Racine 
got 
the 
nod 
again 

Saturday over sophomore Zach 
Nagelvoort. The junior finished 
the weekend having surrendered 
10 goals in two complete games 

while accumulating 69 saves.

“He’s been a good back-to-

back goalie,” Berenson said. “I 
think he’s rebounded from his 
not-so-good games Friday and 
been a lot better Saturday.”

At even strength for most of 

the second period, both teams 
went end to end with little in the 
way of scoring chances on either 
side. Michigan’s best chance 
came early in the frame, when 
a too-many-men penalty and 
subsequent hooking extended the 
power play more than a minute, 
but the Wolverines were unable 
to capitalize.

Michigan was held scoreless 

despite outshooting the Nittany 
Lions 16-8 in the frame.

And the missed opportunities 

would come back to haunt them.

On the power play for the first 

time in the period, Penn State 
broke the tie at the 13:32 mark 
with one second remaining on 
the man advantage. Forward 
Erik Autio teed up from the point, 
firing a shot through Racine’s 
legs.

Then, on his senior night, 

Penn State forward Tommy 
Olczyk tallied the Nittany Lions’ 
fourth goal, sending his team into 
intermission up 4-2.

The 
Nittany 
Lions 
never 

trailed, though after a dismal 
first period Friday at Pegula, 
Michigan could have used a 
strong start.

At the 5:50 mark, when 

Compher netted the Wolverines’ 
first goal to tie the game at 
one, it looked like Michigan 
accomplished that. Instead, Penn 
State forward Scott Conway beat 
Steve Racine a second time in the 
frame.

Then, when a delay-of-game 

penalty called in the waning 
minutes of the frame looked as if 
it would doom Michigan before 
the first intermission, Compher 
raced in front of Copp, who fed 
him for the shorthanded goal.

It was the Wolverines third 

shorthanded goal of the season.

“(Penn State) has done well 

against 
us,” 
Berenson 
said. 

“They have a good record against 
Michigan, so we’re keeping them 
in the league, I guess.”

Penalty kill struggles 
in sweep at Penn State

By ERIN LENNON

Daily Sports Editor

STATE COLLEGE — No more 

than one second after a Penn 
State power play ended Saturday, 
forward Erik Autio’s shot from 
the point snuck through Steve 
Racine’s pads.

Just when the No. 16 Michigan 

hockey team appeared to have 
found an answer to the Nittany 
Lions’ potent power play, the 
junior goaltender was forced to 
dig another puck out of the net.

Though the Wolverines’ own 

power play has consistently been 
ranked among the top 10 in the 
nation, their penalty kill found a 
way to lose them games over the 
weekend. The unit surrendered 
three 
power-play 
goals 
in 

Friday’s 6-4 loss.

“Our 
PK 
was 
terrible 

yesterday,” 
said 
sophomore 

forward 
JT 
Compher 
after 

the game Saturday. “That was 
unacceptable. It kind of lost us 
the game. … We knew that was 
going to be a big thing, and the 
improvement showed.”

Saturday, 
for 
the 
second 

straight game, the Wolverines 
had 
their 
early 
momentum 

undermined by matching delay-
of-game penalties and an ensuing 
Penn State goal.

Michigan’s 
luck 
briefly 

improved when Compher turned 
a breakaway pass from junior 
forward Andrew Copp into the 
Wolverines’ third shorthanded 
goal of the season.

But while they were able 

to convert on two key power-
play 
opportunities 
to 
keep 

themselves in the game Friday, 
they struggled to find twine on 
the 
man-advantage 
Saturday. 

Michigan had an opportunity 
to jump out to an emphatic lead 
thanks to two consecutive Penn 
State penalties.

The Wolverines and Nittany 

Lions accumulated 11 combined 
penalties in the first two periods.

“I thought we were better,” said 

Michigan coach Red Berenson. “I 
thought our power play moved 
the puck well. I thought the PK 
was good. You’d like your power 
play to score on that 5-on-3. That’s 
where you really need to score. 
I think we’re working hard on 
doing the right things.”

Friday, 
the 
teams 
took 

a combined 19 penalties — 
including two sets of matching 
penalties — playing on special 
teams for 38 minutes.

For Michigan, the disparity 

between 
the 
power 
play 

and the penalty kill was on 
display through the first two 
periods. 
After 
surrendering 

two late power-play goals in 
the first period, the Wolverines 
capitalized on two straight man-
advantages — the first from 
Copp, followed by junior forward 
Justin Selman’s tally — to cut the 
Penn State lead to two.

The difference was that while 

Michigan’s 2-for-7 night on the 
power play kept it in the game, 
its 
penalty 
kill 
surrendered 

three goals in four Nittany Lion 
attempts. Penn State also fired 11 
shots to the Wolverines’ 14 despite 
having three fewer chances.

“Yeah, I think (penalties) 

disrupted our flow,” Copp said 
Friday. “We had some good cycles 
going 5-on-5. We had some flow 
to our game, some momentum.”

For a portion of this season — 

namely when the Wolverines’ 
nation-leading 
offense 
was 

averaging more than seven goals 
per game in Big Ten play — 
Michigan’s offensive firepower 
was enough to negate extra 
penalties. But Berenson and his 
team know as well as anyone 
that an offense like that isn’t 
sustainable for 30 games.

Michigan can no longer afford 

to lose Dylan Larkin for 10 
minutes on a game misconduct.

“You can never outscore your 

mistakes for an entire year,” 
Compher said.

‘M’ dominant in Carolina

Coming 
into 
the 
Coastal 

Carolina 
Invitational 
riding 

a five-game win streak, the 
Michigan baseball team was 
already playing its best baseball 
of this young season.

Then the team outscored its 

four opponents by a combined 
score of 37-12 on the weekend.

The Wolverines (9-6) took 

business 
against 
Maryland-

Baltimore County, Toledo and 
Coastal Carolina, before falling 
to Akron in the finale.

In 
its 
Friday 
afternoon 

matchup, Michigan didn’t break 
its momentum against UMBC 
(1-4), taking the game 8-1.

After allowing a run to cross 

the plate in the top of the first 
inning, freshman right-hander 
Ryan Nutof settled into a nice 
rhythm for the rest of his start. 
Through his seven innings, Nutof 
allowed just five hits.

The Wolverines tied the game 

in the bottom of the second with 
a sacrifice fly from senior catcher 
Kendall Patrick and dominated 
the rest of the way. Offensively, 
the team peaked in the bottom 
of the fourth inning, when 
Michigan slapped a five-spot 
onto the scoreboard.

Following a two-run single 

from senior second baseman Eric 
Jacobson, Michigan sent first 
baseman Jacob Cronenworth to 
the plate as the top of the order 
rolled around to try and cause 
more 
two-out 
damage. 
The 

junior sent a towering ball over 
the right-center field wall for a 
three-run home run, giving the 
Wolverines a 6-1 advantage.

Michigan tacked on runs in 

the fifth and seventh innings, 
leaving the final score at 8-1.

Moving to Saturday’s mid-day 

matchup against Toledo (3-9), the 
Wolverines hoped to continue to 
better their average of 5.3 runs 
per game.

Behind one of the best offensive 

performances of Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich’s time at Michigan, 
the team put up a whopping 19 
runs on the Rockets, defeating 
them 19-5.

“Our guys are tough,” Bakich 

said. “We’ve got good hitters 
when guys are executing the 
approach and having quality 
at-bats. In years past, (opponents) 
circled a few guys and focused on 
not letting them beat you. We not 
only have those guys again, but 
we have a bunch more.”

The Wolverines’ scoring was 

evenly spread against Toledo, 
both on the scoreboard and box 
score. Eight Michigan players 
knocked runs in, and the team 
scored in six of the eight innings 
it went to the plate.

The Wolverines set the tone in 

their first at-bats, putting up five 
runs in one inning for the second 
time in as many games. Senior 
left fielder Kevin White sent a 
moonshot to straightaway center 
field with two runners on to give 
Michigan a 5-0 
lead right away.

“You’ve got 

to give Toledo 
credit,” Bakich 
said. “We put 
up five runs 
on them in the 
first 
inning, 

and they didn’t 
back 
down. 

They 
kept 

fighting, and it 
was a three-run difference there 
in the middle of the game. Our 
guys just stuck with the process 
of being tough in the box.”

Righties Jayce Vancena and 

Jackson Lamb both threw four 
solid innings from the mound for 
Michigan. Vancena, a freshman, 
allowed two earned runs and 
four hits, while Lamb shut Toledo 
down in the later innings.

On the tail end of Saturday’s 

doubleheader, the Wolverines 
overcame some early trouble and 
took down what was projected to 
be their toughest opponent of the 
weekend, Coastal Carolina (9-5), 
by the score of 10-4.

Michigan jumped out to a 4-0 

lead through three innings, but 
Coastal Carolina battled back 
with one run in the fourth and 
two in the fifth, sending the 
ballgame to the sixth inning with 
the Wolverines leading by only 
one.

Led by the bats of Benedetti 

and junior third baseman Travis 
Maezes, Michigan earned some 
breathing room in the seventh 
inning, plating four runs.

That 8-3 lead would prove to be 

enough to secure the win for the 
Wolverines, as right-hander Brett 
Adcock kept the Coastal Carolina 
bats at bay through 5.2 innings 
of work. The sophomore allowed 
three runs — none earned — 
while striking out seven.

Benedetti finished the day 

6-for-9 with 10 RBI and is a 
serious contender for Big Ten 
Player of the Week honors.

That win sent the Wolverines 

into the Sunday finale against 
Akron (7-5) on a wave of 
momentum, 
but 
the 
Zips’ 

pitching staff found a way to hold 
the Michigan bats quiet.

Riding 
the 

arm 
of 
left-

hander 
Pat 

Dyer, 
Akron 

shut out the 
Wolverines, 
coming 
away 

with 
a 
2-0 

victory. 
The 

senior allowed 
just five hits 
over 
eight 

innings.

The game was tied heading 

into the bottom of the eighth 
inning when Michigan moved 
Cronenworth from first base 
to take care of business on the 
mound. What happened was far 
from what the team was looking 
for.

The closer faced eight batters 

in his one inning of work. He 
walked three, threw two wild 
pitches and allowed two runs to 
break the late-inning tie.

“(Cronenworth) 
is 
one 
of 

the most electric closers in the 
country,” Bakich said. “Part of 
being an electric or dominant 
closer is that some days you just 
happen to give up a run or two.”

Although it wasn’t the end to 

the Spring Break trip the team 
was hoping for, raising its record 
well above .500 and showing 
some confidence at the plate are 
things Michigan intends to carry 
with it all season.

Hectic schedule takes toll 
in losses to ASU, Florida

By TYLER SCOTT

Daily Sports Writer

Of the 25 games the Michigan 

softball team has played this year, 
none have been at Alumni Field in 
Ann Arbor. Ten of its games have 
been against ranked opponents.

And yet, the third-ranked 

Wolverines still found themselves 
with only one loss heading into 
the Judy Garman Classic in 
Fullerton, California.

Thursday, Michigan lost its 

opener against No. 22 Arizona 
State, 2-0, and it dropped its 
afternoon matchup to undefeated 
No. 1 Florida, 7-4 in its two first 
games of the tournament.

After losing the first two 

games, the Wolverines wrapped 
up the rest of play with three run-
rule wins against San Jose State, 
No. 9 Baylor and San Diego State 
by scores of 9-1, 11-1 and 10-2, 
respectively.

The Saturday win against San 

Diego State completed the fifth 
road trip of the year for Michigan, 
and it capped off a Spring Break 
in which the Wolverines played 
11 games in nine days.

“We are as fatigued as I’ve ever 

seen us,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “We really had 
to gut through this last half of the 
trip. I thought we had to show a 
little grit there to get through it.”

If exhaustion was a factor in 

the Wolverines’ losses to Arizona 
State and Florida, it wasn’t 
necessarily evident. Sophomore 
right-hander 
Megan 
Betsa 

allowed just seven hits and one 
earned run, and she pitched seven 
scoreless innings of work before 
giving up a game-ending two-run 
home run in the eighth inning 
against Arizona State. Despite the 
effort from Betsa, Michigan was 
unable to score any runs.

“I don’t want to say that we 

struggled (at the plate),” said 
junior outfielder Sierra Lawrence 
after the loss to Arizona State. 
“We just didn’t have timely hits, 
and we didn’t get them when we 
should have.”

The Wolverines’ consistently 

productive offense is batting 

.346 as a unit, but it only put up 
five hits against a talented Sun 
Devil pitching staff that has come 
to know the Michigan lineup 
well in recent weeks. But the 
contest a few hours later against 
top-ranked 
Florida 
unfolded 

differently.

After Lawrence reached first 

from her leadoff spot in the first 
frame against the Gators, junior 
infielder Sierra Romero built 
Michigan an early lead with a 
two-run blast to center field.

A two-RBI double to right 

field off the bat of senior left-
hander Haylie Wagner, who 
also pitched the majority of the 
game against Florida, padded 
Michigan’s 4-0 lead in the top 
of the third. However, Florida 
responded in the bottom of the 
same inning with three runs of 
its own after the Wolverines hit 
three batters.

Michigan maintained the one-

run lead until the fifth, when a 
Gator double plated a walked 
batter to even up the score. Betsa 
replaced Wagner in the sixth, but 

Florida was able to score three 
more times, enough to do in the 
Wolverines.

All in all, three runs off of two 

hits and a walk left Betsa with 
both losses on the day. Wagner 
allowed six hits and a walk in her 
efforts against the Gators.

“Really, we gave (the game up),” 

Hutchins said. “We gave way too 
many free bases. It’s an area of the 
game that’s a sore spot for us and 
an area that needs to improve.

“The pitchers just need to do 

a better job of locking in every 
pitch and not letting the pressure 
of the moment get to them.”

Currently, 
the 
Wolverines 

boast a 1.69 team earned-run 
average, good for second in the 
Big Ten.

“It was especially difficult 

against Arizona State, because 
this is the third time we’ve 
played them in a week,” Betsa 
said. “Same thing for Florida, this 
was the second time we’ve faced 
them. They’re definitely better 
teams, which makes the games 
more intense.”
