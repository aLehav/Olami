Martin Luther King 

Jr. Spirit Awards 
given to students 
and organizations

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Twelve students and two student 

organizations 
were 
honored 

Thursday night at the MLK Spirit 

Awards in the Arthur Miller 
Theatre for their contributions 
to both the campus and Detroit 
area communities, as well as for 
exemplifying the legacy of Martin 
Luther King Jr.

The event was organized in a 

combined effort by the School of Art 
& Design, School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance, the College of Engineering 
and Agents for Change, an art 
exhibition promoting diversity on 
North Campus.

The MLK Spirit Awards have 

existed for many years on campus, 
but it was not until several years ago 
that the ceremony was formalized. 
Dean 
of 
Engineering 
David 

Munson said when he started at 
the University in 2006 the North 
Campus community did little to 
promote Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day, with the MLK Spirit Awards 
at that time consisting of a lunch 
between the nominated students 
and the North Campus deans.

Munson said the purpose of 

the formal ceremony instituted in 

recent years for the awards was to 
recognize the work students have 
done to promote diversity on North 
Campus.

“The whole point is to get the 

whole North Campus community 
together and recognize some of our 
students and all of their great work 
related to diversity, inclusion and 
equity,” he said.

Taubman graduate student Ryan 

Goold, one of the award winners, 
said he was shocked and very

The University of Michigan 

Health System has partnered 
with CVS to enhance access to 
health care. Starting in January, 
UMHS and CVS will begin 
utilizing 
a 
communication 

pathway 
between 
their 

respective 
electronic 
health 

record systems to allow for 
better coordination of health 
services.

Hae 
Mi 
Choe, 
director 

of pharmacy innovations at 
University 
Medical 
Group, 

said because UMHS and CVS 
use electronic health record 
systems provided by the vendor 
Epic, they have the ability to 
share information with each 
other via the Electronic Health 

Records.

Choe 
emphasized 
the 

security and safety of the 
new 
connection 
between 

the respective groups in an 
interview, as well as the benefits 
that patients will gain from this 
new collaboration.

“This functionality exists 

with any organization that 
uses Epic, and both parties will 
comply with all state and federal 
laws governing confidentiality 
and 
disclosure 
of 
patient 

information,” she said.

CVS Health has more than 

9,500 retail pharmacy locations 
nationwide 
and 
over 
1,100 

walk-in medical clinics at the 
pharmacy 
locations 
called 

MinuteClinics. 
MinuteClinics 

are open seven days a week and 
are staffed primarily by nurse 
practitioners 
and 
physician 

assistants 
to 
administer 

wellness 
and 
prevention 

services, treat for common 
illnesses and monitor patients 
with chronic diseases.

The collaboration between 

Speakers 

highlight need 
for more young 

talent

By LOGAN HANSEN

For the Daily

DETROIT — Dr. David 

Satcher — former surgeon 
general of the United States 
and assistant secretary for 
health — spoke in Detroit to 
members and supporters of 
the city’s Urban Research 
Center on the future of public 
health and the impact young 
adults can have in the field 
Thursday.

“I can’t stop thinking about 

tomorrow, just can’t stop 
thinking about tomorrow,” 
Satcher said, in reference to 
the popular Fleetwood Mac 
tune.

The Detroit URC, which 

partners with the University’s 
schools of Nursing, Public 
Health and Social Work, 
held its 20th anniversary 
symposium, titled “Advancing 
Partnerships, Research, & 
Equity in Detroit” at the 
Crowne 
Plaza 
Hotel 
in 

downtown Detroit Thursday 
morning.

Adhering 
closely 
to 
a 

theme of fostering leadership 
among 
today’s 
youth, 

Satcher emphasized what he 
identified as his number one 
concern for the future of the 
public health field: lack of 
young talent in the field.

“We’re not seeing enough 

young leaders emerging,” he 

told the audience. “Who is 
going to be doing this 10 years 
from now? Twenty years 
from now? Degrees don’t 
necessarily make leaders; we 
need people who are inspired 
and motivated to lead.”

As 
director 
of 
the 

Centers for Disease Control 
and 
Prevention 
in 
1995, 

Satcher 
was 
instrumental 

in the establishment of the 
organization. The symposium 
was as much a celebration 
of the Detroit URC’s 20 
years of commitment to the 
promotion of community-
based participatory research 
and health equity as it was an 
ode to Satcher’s life work in 
the field of public health.

Satcher went on to pose a 

challenge to the young people 
in attendance: Be continually 
learning about public health 
issues 
to 
help 
prevent 

nationwide crises, such as the 
Flint water crisis, where city 
tap water was contaminated 
with toxic levels of lead.

“There will be crises of 

leadership and we won’t be 
there,” he said. “We need 
young people to take up the 
helm, to tackle urban health 
problems like the one in Flint, 
Michigan. We need to realize 
what it takes for everyone to 
have the opportunity to lead a 
healthy life.”

He was honored with 

plaques 
both 
by 
the 

organization 
and 
Isaiah 

McKinnon, deputy mayor of 
Detroit, standing in for Mayor 
Mike Duggan who was unable 
to attend.

Admissions officers 

nationwide using 

social media more in 
application process

By MEGAN DOYLE

Daily Staff Reporter

If you’re applying to college, 

there’s now a good chance your 
Facebook page could be a factor in 
admission decisions.

A record high of 40 percent 

of college admissions officers in 
the 
nation 
acknowledged 
their 

admissions staff visit applicants’ 
social media pages to learn more 
about them in a 2015 Kaplan survey 
— a 300 percent increase from 2008.

The 
University’s 
admissions 

office was unresponsive to multiple 
requests for comment on if the 
office utilizes prospective students’ 
social media accounts. Evaluative 
comments 
observed 
on 
nine 

applications in August did not have 
any mention of social media.

The 2015 survey that interviewed 

nearly 
400 
college 
admissions 

officers, however, found that overall 
colleges are looking at applicants’ 
social media more than ever.

Despite the increase of attention 

admissions 
officers 
pay 
to 

prospective students’ online profiles, 
the report found 89 percent of officers 
only “rarely” look, and usually do so 
after being “triggered” by something 
in their application.

 One year after ski 
trip vandalism, new 
initiatives begin to 

be implemented

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

One year after vandalism and 

destruction at multiple Northern 
Michigan ski resorts involving four 
University fraternities and sororities 
last winter garnered intense media, 
legal and University scrutiny, both 
Greek life and the larger campus 
community have undergone several 
changes in response.

In February 2015, the University 

announced it would no longer 
affiliate with the Sigma Alpha Mu 
chapter on campus for causing 
roughly $430,000 in damage to a 
ceiling tiles, furniture and carpeting 
in several rooms at the Treetops 
Resort in Gaylord during a Martin 
Luther King Jr. weekend ski trip.

The international board of SAM 

revoked 
the 
chapter’s 
charter 

following the refusal of fraternity 
members to cooperate in a criminal 
investigation, and members lost 
their campus house. Also present at 
the ski trip last year was University 
sorority Sigma Delta Tau, who were 
suspended by the University until 
2017.

The same weekend, Pi Kappa 

Alpha, Chi Psi, Alpha Phi and 
Delta Gamma caused damage to a 
lesser extent to Boyne Highlands 
in Harbor Springs, Mich. and have 
faced University sanctions, though 
their actions didn’t generate the 
same amount of media scrutiny. The

Antimicrobal agent 

nisin shrunk tumors on 
neck and head of mice

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Nisin, an antimicrobal agent 

which is produced by a naturally 
occurring 
bacterium, 
has 
been 

studied since the 1950s and has 
traditionally been used as a food 
preservative. However, according 
to a recent University study, nisin 
has been found to interact with and 
negatively affect the growth of some 
types of cancer as well as antibiotic-
resistant bacteria.

Dentistry Prof. Yvonne Kapila, 

lead researcher for the study, said the 
bacteria has been accepted as a safe 
method of food preservation by both 
the World Health Organization and 
the Food and Drug Administration.

“Of all the food preservatives that 

are out there, nisin is widely, widely 
used and it’s the bacteriocin that has 
had the most background in terms of 

knowledge,” Kapila said.

The bacterium was first identified 

on certain cheeses, Kapila said. Many 
of the cheeses that contained traces 
of nisin were being presented, which 
led to the idea that there had to be 
an active, preserving component to 
nisin.

“It’s been around a long time and 

there’s a large margin of safety and 
I think that’s what makes it very 
attractive (to consumers) — that it’s 
been used as a food preservative and 
it’s been used for many, many years 
in the food industry,” Kapila said.

Kapila’s research into nisin began 

a few years ago, with a post-doctoral 
student who was working to purify 
other types of bacteriocins prior 
to coming to her lab. Bacteriocins, 
which are toxins produced by 
bacteria to stop the growth of 
similar bacterial strains, showed 
cytotoxicity to some tumor cells, 
meaning they’re toxic to certain 
types of cancers.

When 
she 
and 
the 
other 

researchers tested nisin on head 
and neck cancer cells, they found 
that it induces cancer cell death. In 

contrast, when tested on normal 
control cells to see if they were 
affected, they showed no impact, 
prompting the study.

Rackham dentistry student Jae 

Shin, co-author of the study, said 
he investigated the nisin’s role with 
regard to pathogens in dental plaque.

“What we found is that the nisin 

we used, the highly purified and 
processed form of nisin, shows an 
inhibition effect on many of the oral 
pathogens found in dental plaque,” 
Shin said. “We also found that nisin 
can inhibit the formation of dental 
plaque biofilms and also alter or 
disrupt the already-formed mature 
biofilms.”

Kapila said an animal model was 

used for the study where tumor cells 
were injected into mice. Once the 
tumors were visible, researchers 
began to feed the animals a nisin 
shake.

After a period of three weeks, the 

control animals had large tumors, 
while those treated had an average 
of a 70 percent reduction in the 
tumor cells, as well as a 90 percent 
reduction in the tumors themselves.

Kapila said there are also other 

models that she and the researchers 
have used to test nisin. In another 
model, the researchers fed a risin 
to separate group of mice because 
they had to kill the control mice. For 
ethical reasons, because the mice 
suffer after the tumors get so large, 
researchers cannot keep the mice 
alive. However, for the subset of mice 
that were treated with the nisin, 
their lifespans were extended.

“The nisin-treated mice were 

kept alive — the longest one was up 
to four months,” Kapila said. “That’s 
using the model where we’ve already 
injected the tumor cells, the tumors 
were already present and we’re just 
feeding the mice the nisin to keep 
them alive.”

Kapila said the researchers have 

also done another pilot research 
project where they fed the mice an 
older formulation of nisin — with 
only a 2.5 percent concentration — 
before the tumor cells were injected.

Shin said the new formulation of 

nisin, Nisin ZP, is about 95 percent 
pure and is a naturally occurring 
variant of nisin. The only difference 
between the two nisin types is the 

James Logan aims 

to dispel myths 
about sustaining 

life in space

By EMILY ROBERTS

Daily Staff Reporter

James S. Logan, co-founder 

of Space Enterprise Institute 
and former NASA employee, 
spoke 
to 
an 
auditorium 

packed with space enthusiasts 
Wednesday night.

Logan’s talk, titled “Living on 

Mars: Medical Realities of the 
Red Planet, Fact vs. Fantasy,” 
aimed to debunk some common 
myths floating around in the 
media and science communities 
regarding space exploration 
and human adaption to zero 
gravity environments. He spoke 
at length about the importance 
of attention to low-gravity and 
high-radiation effects on the 
human body and the need for a 
life-science perspective in space 
exploration, which is currently 
run by engineers.

Despite 
what 
he 

characterized as a pessimistic 

presentation, Logan said he 
called himself an optimist and 
a true believer in interplanetary 
exploration.

“We have to solve these 

problems; we will solve these 
problems,” Logan said. “Ladies 
and gentlemen, you are the 
generation that can do it.”

Logan served as Mission 

Control surgeon, Deputy Crew 
surgeon and Crew surgeon for 
25 space shuttle missions in his 
20-year career at NASA.

Though he dismissed the 

idea of immediate colonization 
of Mars and its moons, Logan 
offered his ideas of a different 
kind 
of 
extraterrestrial 

settlement. He said one way to 
combat the problems caused by 
radiation and zero gravity on 
Deimos, one of Mars’ moons, is 
to drill into it and build colonies 
into the core.

Logan ended his presentation 

to thunderous applause and 
with a quote from Konstantin 
Tsiolkovsky: “The Earth is 
the cradle of mankind, but 
one cannot live in the cradle 
forever.”

Rackham 
student 

Benjamin Katz said though it 
surprised him, he enjoyed the 

presentation.

“I thought he was going to 

tell us life on Mars is going to 
be within reach,” Katz said. “It 
was the exact opposite, but it 
was really interesting hearing 
all of the science behind it.”

In particular, he said it 

was interesting to compare 
Logan’s work to various artists’ 
renditions of what colonization 
on the lunar surface and what 
the surface of Mars would look 
like.

“All of the pictures you see 

of people on other planets and 
stuff, not only are they not 
feasible now but they’re likely 
never going to be feasible,” 
Katz said. “The way we have to 
visualize people living on other 
planets is going to have to be 
completely different.”

Engineering senior Gideon 

Billings said he was surprised 
a manned mission to Mars 
was unrealistic with today’s 
technology.

“I expected it to be more like 

the issues that the astronauts 
would have to deal with in the 
context of a manned mission 
to Mars whereas we got that 
it’s really not practical to have

CVS 
Health 

includes 
both 
CVS/pharmacy 

and 
MinuteClinic, 
and 
will 

be available at CVS pharmacy 

and 
MinuteClinic 
locations 

nationwide.

“We are always searching for 

new opportunities to provide our 

patients with the absolute best 

patient care possible,” said David 

Spahlinger, executive vice dean for 

clinical affairs at the University’s 

Medical School, in a press release. 

“This affiliation presents us with a 

unique opportunity to collaborate 

with CVS health care providers 

and enhance our system of care 

for our patients to better meet 

their needs.”

The connection will allow — 

only with patient consent — the 

electronic sharing of messages 

and alerts from CVS/pharmacy 

to UMHS-affiliated physicians 

in situations such as medication 

compliance. MinuteClinic will 

also be able to electronically share 

patient visit summaries with the 

patient’s UMHS primary care 

physician.

Currently, when a patient 

is seen at a MinuteClinic or 

other 
urgent 
care 
clinics, 

communicating what happened 

at those visits to their primary 

provider is not as connected. 

Providers rely on faxes, mail 

and the patients themselves to 

remember 
and 
communicate 

what happened at visits with 

other health care providers, Choe 

said. The new clinical affiliation 

between UMHS and CVS aims to 

provide better continuity of care.

“Having this ability to connect 

through our EHR allows us to 

communicate more efficiently and 

in a timely fashion without having 

to burden the patient,” Choe said.

The system will also provide 

aggregate data on interventions 

conducted by CVS pharmacists 

to UHS to improve a patient’s 

adherence to their medication.

CVS Spokeswoman Christina 

Beckerman emphasized that the 

new association will benefit both 

providers and patients.

“This relationship offers a new 

access point and improves care 

coordination 
and 
medication 

management, which are critical 

to a patient’s health,” Beckerman 

said. “UMHS and CVS want to 

ensure that our patients receive 

and have access to the best 

possible care and that means that 

care is coordinated, no matter 

where it is delivered”.

brought up a lot of great points,” 
said Sheena Martenies, Ph.D. 
candidate in the University’s 
Department of Environmental 
Health Sciences. “You can’t just 
stop with challenging an issue, 
you have to move forward and 
deal with it. I thought that was 
very inspirational.”

The symposium also included 

information sessions on studies 
from the Detroit URC, such as 
ones on researching the social 
determinants 
— 
demographic 

characteristics, exposure to air 
pollution, social environments — 
of health inequities.

In 
an 
interview 
after 

Satcher’s address, Linda Pappas, 
communications specialist for 
the Detroit URC, described the 
symposium as a two-fold event 
to both celebrate the center’s 
research 
and 
to 
encourage 

young adults to pursue the 
fields of public health and urban 
research.

“One, to celebrate 20 years 

of success in fostering health 
equity through community-based 
participatory 
research 
(and) 

really celebrating how community 
comes together with academics to 
do research to benefit the health 
of communities,” she said. “But 
then also to inspire people for the 
next generation to take on this 
important work.”

negative: Positive triggers that 
prompted an admissions officer 
to probe an applicant’s social 
media included interesting talents 
or special awards, as well as 
for scholarship considerations, 
while negative triggers included 
disclosure of a criminal record 
or disciplinary action, as well 
as an anonymous tip about 
inappropriate behavior.

LSA freshman Susie Meaney 

said she did not feel as though her 
social media would have affected 
her college prospects last year.

“I’m also very conscious of 

what I post regardless, so I didn’t 
really feel like I had a lot to worry 
about,” Meaney said.

Engineering sophomore Matt 

Schafer, on the other hand, 
expressed his discomfort with 
the practice. Schafer said posts 
on social media profiles are not 
necessarily representative of the 
candidate.

“It’s a little unfair because 

someone might have just like, 
said something stupid, being silly 
on Twitter, on Facebook, and 
that would end up possibly not 
letting them into the college they 
really wanted to get into, when 
everything else, they had qualified 
for, or not getting a scholarship 
that they really needed,” Schafer 
said.

Meaney also said she feels 

this practice is unfair, as it 
disproportionately benefits high 
schoolers who were aware of an 
admissions officer’s likelihood of 

checking social media.

“Basically, if someone had 

maybe an older sibling or a cousin 
that had gone through something 
like that, then they were more 
conscious, but I think some people 
hadn’t heard from other people 
that, ‘Oh, colleges actually do look 
at your social media,’ and those 
people didn’t really care (what 
they posted),” Meaney said.

The survey also found that 

social media could both positively 
and negatively affect a prospective 
student’s 
application. 
Thirty-

seven 
percent 
of 
admissions 

officers said an applicant’s social 
media had positively affected 
their view of the candidate, but 
an equal 37 percent said it had 
negatively affected their decision.

Positive 
findings 
included 

previously 
undisclosed 

community 
involvement 
or 

leadership roles, while negative 
findings included evidence of drug 
or alcohol use, criminal activity or 
otherwise inappropriate behavior.

The 
University 
admissions 

website does not explicitly say 
they check social media profiles, 
though they state valuing traits 
outside of an applicant’s test 
scores, such as “evidence of 
leadership, awards and service.”

“We look at each student as a 

whole package, a combination of 
talents, interests, passions, and 
skills,” the website states. “In this 
way, we can look beyond grades 
and test scores to recruit the 
most dynamic group of students 
possible.”

Engineering freshman Niko 

Sawan said using social media 
as a measure of judgment for 

admissions is justified since a 
serious candidate would already 
be wary of posting inappropriate 
content on social media.

“I don’t see a problem with 

them checking social media,” 
Sawan said. “If you’re really 
worried about your stuff on (social 
media), there’s so many ways to 
make yourself private, change 
your name, do all this stuff. So 
if you’re really serious about 
applying to college, I don’t think 
there’s any reason for you to have 
something that would make the 
difference between you getting 
into college or not.”

Despite the fact that some 

may be unaware that college 
admissions can look at applicants’ 
social media, Meaney said overall 
she feels it’s justified in verifying 
jobs and awards as well as 
allocating scholarships.

“I think that your social media 

pages are kind of like an extension 
of yourself and can kind of reveal 
more than you would put in an 
application,” Meaney said.

Schafer 
echoed 
Meaney’s 

sentiments, and said reviewing 
an applicant’s social media allows 
a college admissions officer to 
get a more holistic view of that 
applicant.

“I think it’s okay to a certain 

extent. It definitely does give 
admissions officers a different side 
to the person, so it’s not just what 
I’m trying to show you. When 
you’re doing an (application), you 
kind of put all the good qualities 
about you, not necessarily the bad 
ones, so social

that

colonization is going to be 
different from the image 
that media and pop culture

“You have this concept 

from sci-fi of how you see 

manned missions and how 
you see media pick up on that 
but then when you get down to 
reality it’s a lot different but it’s 
still possible and even in our 
future,” Billings said.

Billings and Katz both 

expressed their excitement 
that the University was able 
to get ahold of a speaker like 
Logan.

Logan also held a Q and 

A 
session 
with 
students 

following the presentation.

damages caused at Boyne were 
determined to be non-malicious.

Four 
members 
of 
SAM 

fraternity, 
including 
the 

chapter’s former president and 
treasurer, have faced criminal 
charges on accounts of malicious 
destruction of property and the 
provision of alcohol and drugs to 
minors over the incident.

Mary Beth Seiler, director of 

Greek life at the University, said 
the events served as a call to 
action for members of the Greek 
life community.

“It was a huge wake up call 

I think for everybody,” Seiler 
said. “I think there was a lot 
of surprise at what ultimately 
happened to the organizations 
that 
were 
involved. 
Maybe 

organizations 
didn’t 
realize 

when it first happened how big 
it could get and what that public 
opinion meant.”

In September 2015, University 

President Mark Schlissel held 
a 
community-wideGreek 
life 

assembly that required at least 70 
percent of all chapters to attend 
— an unprecedented action for a 
University president. Fraternities 
and sororities were told that if 
they didn’t meet the attendance 
requirement, they would face a 
$1,000 fine and social probation.

The 
meeting 
marked 
the 

first time the entire Greek 

community, 
including 
the 

National Pan-Hellenic Council 
and Multicultural Greek Council, 
gathered in the 170-year history 
of Greek life on campus.

Central topics of the September 

meeting included a pressing 
need for Greek organizations to 
curb sexual assault and alcohol 
abuse, stemming from what was 
characterized by administrators 
as 
excessive 
party 
culture. 

Schlissel warned students their 
behavior 
would 
ultimately 

devalue their own degrees and 
taint the University’s national 
image.

“The value of their degrees 

are gonna go down because the 
reputation of the University 
of 
Michigan 
won’t 
be 
the 

excitement in the Big House or 
our teams doing well under our 
fantastic new coach,” Schlissel 
said at the September meeting. 
“It’s not gonna be the kids who 
receive the Rhodes Scholarships 
and the Fulbright Scholarships, 
and the famous professors who 
do the work that you’re going 
to get reflected on for, or the 
National Medal for the Arts that 
our faculty won this past week. 
It’s going to be the ‘Shmacked’ 
videos. So it’s really up to you 
what the value of your education 
is going to be, what the reputation 
of this institution’s going to be.”

Speaking 
to 
Schlissel’s 

September 
statement, 
Seiler 

said she had concerns over 
the heightened visibility and 

therefore 
negative 
scrutiny 

Greek life organizations attract 
on campus.

She said Greek life tends to be 

a target for scrutiny due to the 
6,000-person 
membership 
as 

well as visible letters on clothing 
and houses. She noted, however, 
that the poor decisions of some 
organizations 
unfairly 
reflect 

poorly on others.

In an interview with the Daily 

directly following September’s 
mass meeting, one fraternity 
member — choosing to remain 
anonymous due to Greek life 
chapters’ strict rules prohibiting 
members of organizations from 
speaking to news or media 
outlets 
— 
expressed 
similar 

sentiments, saying Greek life 
receives magnified scrutiny for 
campus-wide issues.

“If anything, a lot of the 

times when incidents happen 
it’s people from outside of the 
organization that come to our 
parties 
and 
cause 
trouble,” 

he said at the time. “So, it’s a 
message that really should have 
been transmitted to the entire 
University.”

Seiler 
said 
she 
thought 

Schlissel’s comments may not 
apply to all Greek life members, 
and that she hoped joining a 
Greek life organization would not 
devalue a Michigan education.

“I would certainly hope that it 

wouldn’t devalue the education, 
and that would be the last thing 

inclusion of ZP, a highly purified 
form of nisin, as opposed to 
some 
other 
commercially 

available forms of nisin, which 
are concentrated at 2.5 percent. 
Kapila said the ZP is the most 
effective.

Kapila said they are currently 

working to see if the bacteriocin 
could be toxic to cancers in other 
areas of the body aside from 
head and neck cancer cells. She 
said it would be beneficial to try 
to do the experiment and feed 
the mice the nisin milkshake 
prior to injecting them with the 
tumor cells to see if they can 
prevent the cells from initially 
even taking root.

Ultimately, Kapila said she 

is hoping to do a clinical trial, 
but finding funding has been a 
setback.

Though 
the 
research 

suggests that nisin could help 
prevent the development of 
cancer cells, this does not mean 
overconsumption of products 
that 
contain 
preservatives 

such as nisin will be beneficial 
to one’s health. One common 
misconception is that over-
consuming 
products 
that 

contain 
these 
and 
other 

similar preservatives will have 
positive effects and reduce the 
likelihood of developing cancer 
cells. This is not true, Kapila 
said.

“The preservative that’s in 

the food, there is a shelf life to 
it,” Kapila said. “So by the time 
people ingest foods that have 
nisin in it, a lot of it is probably 
broken down. So the amount 
of it that people actually ingest 
is not anywhere near to the 
quantities that have been tested 
in the animal models or the cell 
models.”

grateful to have been recognized. 
Goold works on the Detroit 
Design/Build Dreamscape, which 
helps renovate the landscape 
of the James and Grace Lee 
Boggs School through utilizing 
sustainable technologies.

“I was completely taken by 

surprise,” Goold said. “I am really 
overwhelmed with gratitude. It is 
really such an honor to be named 
a Spirit Award winner, especially 
with the namesake of Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr.”

Munson 
and 
Christopher 

Kendall, former dean of the 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance, 
were also honored at the event for 
their efforts to promote diversity 
in their various schools. The two 
spearheaded an effort to increase 
diversity events on North Campus, 
as well as encourage and increase 
minority representation within 
their respective schools.

This year’s awards are the first 

to include a collaboration between 
the deans and students in planning 
the event. Derrick Scott, Director 
of Inclusion and Multicultural 
Engineering 
Programs, 
said 

students showed a desire to help, 
so 
they 
accommodated 
their 

ambition.

“This is the first time the 

students have come together the 
way that they have,” Scott said. 
“Once they did, we said we are 
going to find a way to make sure 
we can blend it with them.”

This new partnership resulted 

in a new addition to the event: 
the Agents of Change gallery. 
The gallery, which highlights 
the importance of diversity and 
community on campus, has been 
on display since Jan. 8, and is 
a combined effort among the 
different schools located on North 
Campus.

The idea for the gallery initially 

came from Stamps in Color, a 
student organization aimed at 
promoting diversity for students 
in the Art and Design school. The 
project started with the goal of 
creating an event to better honor 
Martin Luther King Jr. on North 
Campus, ending with the exhibit, 
which 
aimed 
to 
incorporate 

aspects of every school on North 
Campus.

Amy Kamdem-Wandji, LSA 

and Art & Design senior and one 
of the founders of Stamps in Color, 
said the organization wanted to 
make students on North Campus 
more aware of the importance in 
promoting diversity.

“The 
conversation 
doesn’t 

happen very much up here,” 
Kamdem-Wandji 
said. 
“We 

wanted to do something where 
for once the focus was here. 
We wanted to say, ‘Hey North 
Campus, you too have to talk about 
this. This matters in your work 
and your schoolwork.”

I

n the past two weeks, Vox, The New 
York Times, the Washington Post and 
The Daily Show have all covered the 

Flint water crisis. In late 
December, Rachel Maddow 
did a 20-minute spot on 
what is happening. And 
Democratic 
Presidential 

candidates Bernie Sanders 
and 
Hillary 
Clinton 

discussed it at their most 
recent debate.

Though I won’t go detail 

by detail in this column how 
the water crisis happened, 
one thing is abundantly 
clear: When the decision 
was made to switch water supplies from Detroit 
to the Flint River, the state government did noth-
ing to prevent corrosion of the pipes (mind you, 
it would have only cost an extra $100 a day). And 
when the public complained that something was 
wrong with the water, the government actively 
tried to disprove the complainers, saying every-
thing was just fine.

It’s mind-blowing, it’s preposterous, it’s what 

happens when you choose to care more about 
dollar signs than people’s lives. And we know this 
wouldn’t have happened in a wealthier city. Not 
in Ann Arbor, that’s for sure. Definitely not in my 
hometown of West Bloomfield.

Governor Snyder needs to resign. The person 

who helped cause this man-made disaster should 
not be the one allowed to fix it.

Though I could go on about Snyder’s failures, 

I also want to talk to about the people of Flint — 
water activists — who have dedicated hours and 
hours of their time over the past year to raise 
awareness on this issue.

These are people who had been speaking to 

deaf ears, trying to do what is right. These are 
people who shouldn’t have had to do what they 
did. Because we’re talking about water, some-
thing (and I shouldn’t have to say this) that no 
one can live without. These are the everyday 
people turned activists to advocate for something 
they shouldn’t have had to advocate for — a basic 
human right. 

When they could have been fighting for liter-

ally anything else — income inequality, raising 
the minimum wage, criminal justice reform — 
they had to fight for water. Heck, they didn’t even 
need to advocate for anything. They should have 
been able to live their lives. Because why should 
anyone, in the 21st century in the United States 
of America, have to worry about if their drinking 
water is clean?

I visited Flint twice last October and Novem-

ber and was able to meet some of these activists: 
LeeAnne Walters, Melissa Mays and Nayyirah 
Shariff. They’ve protested at city hall and met 
with state leaders, the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality and Environmental 
Protection Agency numerous times. All they’ve 
wanted this past year by badgering the city, state 
and federal government was for someone to 
acknowledge there was a problem in Flint and do 
something about it.

And they’re not alone in their efforts. During 

our conversations, they spoke about how the level 

of activism in Flint has increased recently.

“I guess you could say the flip side to (the 

Flint water crisis) is that more people are 
involved in city council meetings now,” Wal-
ters told me. “More people are getting out 
there and becoming more actively involved in 
the city. Not saying it should have taken this 
to make that happen, but if you’re trying to 
look for a silver lining, there’s that part of it. I 
know I never went to city council meetings.”

“I trusted (city council) to vote and do what 

was best for us at the meetings. When all this 
happened, that changed.”

Mays said, “We don’t want it to happen to 

anybody else. So that’s why we’ve been making 
this big, huge stink this entire time to stop it from 
happening to us, but then so it doesn’t happen to 
another community.”

Shariff, who is a member of the Flint Democra-

cy Defense League, added, “I considered myself 
an activist, but it wasn’t really around water 
because I’m like, ‘We live in Michigan. I can just 
drive an hour and be at a lake somewhere.’ ”

Toward the end of our meeting at her dining 

room, I asked Mays directly if she also ever imag-
ined learning so much about water.

“I wonder in an alternate universe, had I not 

moved here, had this not happened or something 
like that or had I not shown up to the very first 
protest (last January) about the cost and (Total 
Trihalomethanes), how different would my life 
be,“ Mays said. “But at least I know why I’m sick. 
I know what’s wrong with me. At least we have 
actions planned for the future. And honestly, I 
feel like we’ve done a lot of good.”

She continued, “(Nayyirah and I) joke all 

the time how I’m a metalhead. I’m covered 
in tattoos. I work in public relations. Never 
would our paths have crossed, nor the fact 
that we spend most of our social time hang-
ing out with old pastors in churches.”

“I know!” Shariff chimed in. “Who would 

have thunk that?”

“Never did I think we would ever have met or 

nor would we hang out with these people,” Mays 
said. “We’re texting pastors at all times and we’re 
making all these things or standing up and yell-
ing and screaming next to these older people. I 
never would have thought that was going to be 
part of my life because my social life is concerts 
and my bands and hanging out with everybody 
else and stuff. And now it’s like, ‘I can’t come out 
tonight because we have a water meeting’ and 
everybody understands, but it’s kind of cool.”

These friendships were forged at an astro-

nomical cost. Sure, we want our communities to 
come together, but not under these circumstanc-
es. Not at the price of an entire city that is going to 
suffer from exorbitant physical, mental and fiscal 
problems for decades to come.

These activists are our heroes. While the 

work is far, far from done, Walters, Shariff 
and Mays are three of the many who have 
stood up, made noise and didn’t stop doing so 
until somebody listened.

I just can’t stop thinking how they shouldn’t 

have had to do it.

O

n a mild evening, January 
2015 
in 
Washington 

D.C., the sunset radiated 

on arguably the most powerful 
monument on the National Mall. I 
stood with my eyes closed, inhaled 
in the crisp air and slowly opened 
my eyes to the image of the Martin 
Luther King Jr. memorial. An 
irreplaceable human, civil rights 
activist, writer, preacher, rebel, 
father, husband, man of Alpha 
Phi Alpha fraternity; a complex 
individual 
overloaded 
with 

responsibility and commitments, 
but 
authentically 
dedicated 
to 

the betterment of human lives. 
I gazed longingly at his face and 
could feel nothing but admiration 
for the courage he and countless 
other leaders of the Civil Rights 
Movement had. They were all 
true public servants. The bravery, 
audacity, 
strength, 
endurance 

and sacrifice it took to confront 
and fight against the repulsive 
disregard and disrespect of human 
life is unimaginable. In this global 
society, where injustices prevail 
and suffering demoralizes and 
dehumanizes the most vulnerable 
populations, I feel anger, anxiety, 
sorrow 
and 
passion 
for 
such 

extremities 
to 
disappear 
from 

existence.

My heart was particularly heavy 

the day I visited the memorial 
because I had just heard that an 
aimless bullet had stolen my cous-
in’s life as he was visiting Detroit 
from Florida to see his family. This 
was in January 2015, just months 
after the Ferguson protests, but 
predating the riots that sought 
justice for Freddie Gray, Renisha 
McBride, Walter Scott and count-
less other terroristic efforts by 
the police toward Black bodies. 
As I sat in the National Mall of the 
nation’s capital, I felt defeated by 
the culture of violence — physi-
cal, social, economic, political and 
legal — that has plagued and dete-
riorated Black communities since 
they have been brought to the 
shores of the United States.

Alicia Garza, one of the founders 

of the Black Lives Matter movement, 
visited the University of Michigan to 
kick off this year’s MLK Symposium. 
She rightfully noted that, “for the last 
10 years, an uprising has been brew-
ing.” Hurricane Katrina was a glaring 
alarm that the fight for humanity and 
dignity for Black Americans was not 
over, as the repetition of police shoot-
ings have also proven. We are in an 
era of challenge and controversy. In 
this moment, we must stand united 
to commit ourselves to the struggle 
for equal rights.

People of color, and largely Black 

bodies, have always been bullied 
with violence. In the millennial 
era, police terrorism, education 
inequality, 
mass 
incarceration, 

economic oppression and public 
health discrimination are only 
a few of the abusive techniques 
used to degrade and strip human-
ity and dignity from Black people. 
The most recent act of social, 
environmental and racial civil 
injustice is Flint’s water crisis. 
The clear breakdown in author-
ity, which led to this manmade 
humanitarian catastrophe, should 
have been halted from the onset. 
Despite community input and 
votes against the imposition of an 
emergency financial manager, 12 
cities in Michigan were assigned 

to an emergency financial man-
ager, nine of which have majority 
Black populations. The emergency 
manager, with the approval of 
Governor Snyder, legally admin-
istered an oversight of the quality 
of water in Flint, vacuously ratio-
nalized by saving the government 
money. Public services, especially 
in relation to public health, should 
never be jeopardized for money. 
Efficiency should never come at 
the expense of the quality of life 
for individuals. Flint’s water crisis 
is an example of a civil infraction 
conducted by public servants that 
was only allowed to fester as long 

as it has because the population of 
people who suffered were minori-
ties. The denial of access to clean 
water is an additional tick mark 
in the tally of offenses that prove 
Black lives are undervalued.

This is the mantra Black Lives 

Matter has had to manifest itself 
in for a multitude of social issues: 
gun violence, access to basic ser-
vices, economic equality and edu-
cation. The U.S. education system 
was never built to accommodate 
students of color. For more than five 
decades, Blacks have had to prove 
they deserve the equal opportunity 
to obtain access to higher education, 
be included in campus environments 
and required texts for courses and 
have resources necessary to support 
retention and graduation. Nation-

wide, Black university students have 
triggered a ripple of protests that 
challenge their respective univer-
sities’ administrations to shift the 
dynamics of diversity on their cam-
puses. Incidents at the University of 
Missouri, Yale University, Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley, Harvard, 
University of Michigan and many 
other colleges and universities have 
demonstrated the ongoing, century-
old battle of viewing and treating 
Black and minority students like 
full human beings. Still, in 2016, 
Black Americans have to remind the 
majority that Black people deserve 
to have equal access to a quality edu-
cation. Many educational experts 
and economists have argued that 
quality educational attainment pro-
motes economic wellbeing, which is 
why the president has advocated for 

reforms, such as two years of tuition-
free community college, that would 
increase the opportunity for aca-
demic and economic mobility across 
races and socioeconomic statuses 
during his tenure in office.

President Barack Obama has been 

a public servant who champions edu-
cation and economic opportunity. 
Wednesday, the president visited 
Detroit to spotlight the recovery of 
the city and the auto industry. After 
visiting the North American Interna-
tional Auto Show and touring a few 
neighborhoods of Detroit, the presi-
dent made remarks at the United 
Auto Workers General Motors Cen-
ter for Human Resources. He spent 
the majority of the speech recount-
ing his initiative in the $85 million 
auto bailout that rooted the city for 
an economic redevelopment, point-
ing out the resistance he faced that 
would have allowed the automotive 
industry to crumble. The auto indus-
try’s renaissance resulted in 900,000 
new jobs in six years, lower gas pric-
es and an expansion of the economy. 
Even with the revival of jobs, techno-
logical advances and threats against 
unionization display the challenges 
the industry still faces. President 
Obama affirmed that not all of the 
industry’s problems are solved: “I’m 
not suggesting we should be satis-
fied with where we are.” We cannot 
be satisfied with meager amends to 
full restitution. Both citizens and the 
public servants they elect must work 
collaboratively to eliminate the bar-
riers to that hinder progression and 
inclusion in American society.

We are in an age of resurgence 

of protests modeling those from 
the 1960s, whose methods and 
approaches to activism have been 
revived and reconfigured to thrive 
in the digital age. Yet roots of 
injustice continue to spread their 
branches, 
roadblocking 
societal 

progress at every intersection. 
MLK’s nonviolent approach to jus-
tice is imperative now more than 
ever in a global society where pis-
tols and bombs are mistaken as the 
deliverers of peace. We, as a global 
society, can no longer tolerate 
exclusion of citizenship. The global 
chain of movements driven organi-
cally by the people — against a cor-
rupt Mexican government overrun 
by drug kingpins, for economic 
inclusion in Tunisia, for political 
voice in Haiti and for dignity and 
respect for quality education in 
Detroit — give me hope. As many 
systematic, institutional and legal 
structures thwart any attempts of 
equality, we shall overcome.

The theme of this year’s MLK 

Symposium 
was 
#WhoWill-

BeNext, though we all must recog-
nize that #WeAreNow. We are the 
change that we seek. We are public 
servants, and have rise to the call 
of being the stewards of human-
ity. Similar to Martin Luther King 
Jr., I, too, “have the audacity to 
believe that peoples everywhere 
can have three meals a day for 
their bodies, education, and cul-
ture for their minds, and dignity, 
equality and freedom for their 
spirits.” Until that mission is ful-
filled, we must remain loyal to the 
mission to eliminate the threats to 
justice as the current caretakers 
of mankind for the betterment of 
#WhoWillBeNext.

ALBUM REVIEW
Panic! at the Disco 
can’t remain relevant

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

For long-time Panic! at the 

Disco fans, it may be hard to 
believe that the group’s first 
album 
came 

out 
over 
a 

decade 
ago 

and that their 
most 
recent 

release, Death 
of a Bachelor, 
is the work 
of only one 
of the origi-
nal 
mem-

bers. Despite 
Panic!’s 
consistently varied sound and 
member make-up, one thing has 
remained the same — the pres-
ence of Brendon Urie.

As the lead singer, Urie has 

always acted as the face of the 
group — a face that has reflected 
the dynamism of their sound. His 
voice is theatrical, strong and, at 
times, overbearing. Death of a 
Bachelor showcases Urie’s ability 
to mimic a retro cabaret croon 
and hit Broadway-level notes all 
in the same song. Though Urie’s 
vocal 
chops 
are 
undeniably 

impressive, his skill isn’t enough 
to deem his latest attempt at rel-
evance a success.

The album’s high points come 

when Urie creates a narrative, 
using his jumping, low register 
vocals to tell a story of intrigue. 

“The Good, the Bad and the 
Dirty” constructs one such nar-
rative. Using Panic!’s perma-lay-
ered percussive instrumentation, 
the track manages to relay pro-
miscuous and cheeky lyrics with-
out coming off as desperate for 
mainstream recognition.

Another 
high 
point, 
“LA 

Devotee,” is instantly the most 
capturing. The combination of 
brass instrumentation and the 
fluctuating, high-energy chorus 
stating, “Drinking white wine in 
the blushing light / Just another 
LA Devotee,” makes the track 
radio-ready yet classic in its sig-
nature Panic! delivery. The lyrics 
also shed light on Urie’s personal 
life, showing his devotion to Los 
Angeles and all of its oddities. 

“LA 
Devotee” 
traverses 
a 

rough transition into “Golden 
Days,” which showcases Urie 
grasping for youth. The track 
starts out well enough, with Urie 
delivering a powerful yet war-
bling narrative, moving smoothly 
into a bass-driven crescendo of 
a pre-chorus. Next, Urie’s voice 
essentially screams at listeners, 
“We’ll stay drunk, we’ll stay tan, 
let the love remain” before mov-
ing into the repetitive singing of 
“Golden days.” At this point in his 
career, Urie’s choice to resort to 
lyrics about partying and youth 
comes off not as an honest repre-
sentation of his pop-star life, but 
as a last-ditch effort at musical 
significance. The lack of lyrical 
complexity, especially when con-
sidering some of Panic!’s previous 
work, is disappointing.

Continuing with this sub-

stance-fueled 
trend, 
“Don’t 

Threaten Me With a Good Time” 
is predominantly overwhelm-
ing. Though not entirely devoid 
of wit, the few charming lines 

are not enough to save the track. 
Phrases like “I lost a bet to a guy 
in a chiffon skirt / But I can make 
these high heels work” play on 
the androgyny and sexuality of 
early Panic!, but don’t go much 
further than that.

Aside from the forced party-

themed tracks, the album does 
feature some more enjoyable 
mellow tunes. Songs like “Death 
of a Bachelor” and “Hallelujah” 
are more genuine and feature 
insights into Urie’s life — refer-
encing his recent marriage and 
Mormon upbringing. The clos-
ing track, “Impossible Year,” is 
by far the most sincere. It’s the 
first track that will make you 
feel something other than the 
false adrenaline rush that comes 
with talk of alcohol-induced 
fun. The honest and somber 
tone is accompanied by swell-
ing, orchestral instrumentation 
and, upon listening to this final 
track, most of the album seems 
trite and unnecessary.

Death of a Bachelor is a testa-

ment to the fact that Panic! at 
the Disco works best when Urie 
embraces his strengths as an 
artist of vocal prowess and lyri-
cal candor. Unfortunately, the 
album ultimately falls victim to 
Urie’s inability to cope with his 
changing status. w

DCD2

Spike Lee’s latest 
makes up for lack of 
story with lyricism

By JOE WAGNER

For the Daily

America’s third largest city, 

where homicides have surpassed 
the death toll of the American 
Special Forces 
in Iraq. Where 
the majority of 
these murders 
are 
of 
black 

males and by 
black 
males. 

Where 
400 

school age kids 
were shot in 
the year 2015. 
Where 55 peo-
ple were shot and wounded on 
July 4, 2015 and ten more were 
murdered. This is Chi-Raq, Dril-
linois, the subject of Spike Lee’s 
most recent film.

Screenwriters 
Kevin 
Will-

mott (“Bunker Hill”) and Spike 
Lee (“Do the Right Thing”) 
have 
crafted 
a 
retelling 
of 

Aristophanes’ 
Greek 
comedy 

“Lysistrata” 
written 
almost 

entirely in verse. In the ancient 
play, Lysistrata convinces all of 
the women of Greece to remain 
chaste until the men negoti-
ate peace to end the Pelopon-
nesian War. In the modernized 
“Chi-Raq,” Lysistrata (Teyonah 
Parris, “Dear White People”) 
persuades the black women of 
South Side Chicago, and more-

over the world, to withhold 
sexual relations from their men 
until the gun violence ends, until 
there is peace.

The dialogue is exceptional. 

It is simultaneously powerful, 
beautiful and hilarious while 
dealing with a controversial 
issue. The humor does not detract 
from the gravity of the film but 
uses comedy to alleviate tension. 
At first, for one who is unaccus-
tomed to hearing verse, the dia-
logue is somewhat hard to follow; 
however, within minutes, the ear 
adapts to the rhythmic exchanges 
between characters. In fact, the 
rhythm of the verse creates a sen-
sation of movement and continu-
ity through the movie. The verse 
dialogue does, however, at times 
feels more like a gimmick than an 
aid for storytelling. The dialogue 
is comprised of a mixture of col-
loquial dialect and elevated lan-
guage more often associated with 
the theater from which the basis 
of the story originates. This mix-
ture attempts to make “Chi-Raq” 
a didactic epic grounded by the 
real world.

Often acting in conjunction 

with dialogue, the choreogra-
phy of the movie furthers what 
the characters are saying and 
is visually thought provoking. 
The opening scene is an incred-
ible dance number to “My City” 
by Nick Cannon (“The Killing 
Room”) who plays the character 
called Chi-raq. Throughout the 
movie, coordinated movements 
where groups on screen perform 
a distinct action, like when the 
women, while discussing deaths 

as a result of gang violence, hold 
up their hands and say “bang, 
bang,” are powerful.

Additionally, the music, con-

sisting of almost all Chicago 
related songs and many origi-
nal songs created specifically 
for the film, helps tell the story. 
The soundtrack ranges from rap 
tracks by Nick Cannon to tunes 
from Bruce Hornsby.

Although not as a result of 

dialogue, the story itself falls 
short. The film begins to lag 
about two-thirds of the way 
through while various groups 
figure out how to break the 
women’s strike. As the story 
continues, it becomes increas-
ingly far-fetched and overly 
preachy. Although the style of 
the film is over-the-top, the 
suspension of disbelief is not 
maintained. The ending is com-
pletely contrived and forced. 
However, the film does achieve 
the goal it set out to do: to dis-
cuss gun and gang violence on 
the South Side. Despite dealing 
with a heavy subject, “Chi-Raq” 
is able to inform, be humorous 
and entertain.

FILM REVIEW
‘Chi-Raq’ fights 
guns with music

TV REVIEW
‘Colony’ doesn’t live 
up to strong premise

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Josh 
Holloway’s 
shaggy 

hair was understandable, even 
endearing, in “Lost.” He was 
stranded 
on 

a 
deserted 

island, 
after 

all, and often 
appeared 
shirtless, 
therefore 
rendering 
the unkempt 
state of his 
hair obsolete. 
Unfortu-
nately, thanks to the under-
whelming plot and the lack of 
emotional connection with the 
characters, USA’s new science 
fiction series “Colony” falls as 
flat as Holloway’s hair.

Set in a post-alien occupa-

tion version of modern day L.A., 
“Colony” centers around Wil-
liam Sullivan (Holloway) and 
his family, who are trying to 
survive within the rigid rules 
imposed by their conquerors. 
Few details are revealed in the 
pilot about the alien invasion, 
but a deafening tone of fear 
and oppression rings clear. The 
L.A. landscape is plagued with 
partially destroyed skyscrapers 
as men in black uniforms (peo-
ple who have chosen to work 
for the occupiers) exert their 
unchecked power on the rest of 
the civilians. The boundaries 
of the new regime are tested, 
and an overwhelming sadness 

undercuts all.

Depressing and wildly con-

fusing, the alien invasion that 
“Colony” depicts sorely lacks 
excitement. For starters, there 
are no alien appearances in 
the pilot, only future-esque 
drones buzzing through the air 
and human slaves carrying out 
orders. The aliens’ anonym-
ity could perhaps be a tactic to 
hook the viewers to continue 
watching further into the sea-
son, but instead, it takes away 
the most anticipated element of 
a sci-fi series. A show that prom-
ises an extraterrestrial invasion 
inevitably tickles the imagina-
tion, piquing the audience’s 
interest to see how the creators 
envisioned another life form. 
But the aliens remain faceless 
and nameless, and a human vil-
lain (Peter Jacobson, “House”) 
seeking to capitalize on the suf-
fering of others is introduced 
instead. The plot could just as 
well be driven by an all-human 
regime, erasing the need for 
creativity and inventiveness all 
together.

Perhaps the show hoped 

removing the “fantasy” would 
highlight an aspect of human-
ity when it is put to an extreme. 
“Colony” attempts to make the 
argument that humans will 
turn on each other in the pres-
ence of fear, so long as they feel 
they do not have another choice. 
The palpable hostility and ten-
sion within the fictitious soci-
ety, however, is not effective 
enough to drive this point home 

and only alienates the charac-
ters from developing depth and 
sympathy on screen.

Holloway’s character is per-

haps most disappointing of all, 
as he embodies the epitome of 
heroism without even a tinge of 
complicated backstory to color 
his persona. Putting his family 
above all, he is willing to put 
his own life on the line to do 
the “right thing” without even 
a single moment of human self-
ishness. Juxtaposed with his 
well-developed and complex 
character in “Lost,” he appears 
on “Colony” as one-dimensional 
and boring. Even his relation-
ship with his wife Kate (Sarah 
Wayne Callies, “The Walking 
Dead”) lacks a genuine connec-
tion, and a truly unsettling sex 
scene makes it even more off-
putting. Even though the con-
ditions of the occupation are so 
monotonously depressing, the 
characters’ personalities fail to 
show through, blending into the 
rest of the surroundings. 

Slow-moving and hard to fol-

low, the USA series premiere 
doesn’t live up to expectations. 
“Colony” pales in compari-
son to the wild success of the 
network’s “Mr. Robot,” which 
explores 
colorful 
characters 

and intricate plot lines sorely 
missing from the sci-fi series. 
Lacking imagination and spark, 
“Colony” leaves gaping holes of 
unanswered questions that are 
so overwhelming, viewers are 
more likely to give up and lose 
interest altogether.

Hip-Hop Columnist

D

r. Martin Luther King 
Jr. delivered one of 
his most pivotal, most 

iconic speeches in 1963 before 
the Lincoln Memorial in Wash-
ington D.C., sweltering in 
the August heat. King shared 
his dreams before a crowd of 
250,000, with not one dream 
making reference to hip hop — 
understandably so, as it wasn’t 
born yet.

But that was over 50 years 

ago. Not only is hip hop now 
alive and well (even if that 
“well” part is contentious, and 
probably even the “alive” part 
if we ask Nas his opinion), but 
it has undeniably solidified its 
place as the music of present 
day youth culture. For more rea-
sons than I can explain or even 
understand, hip hop is impor-
tant — hip hop as a culture that 
is, because to solely condense 
all that is hip hop into a musical 
genre is to trivialize the Black 
brilliance that brought it into 
being. But rapping, an element 
of hip hop, is important as well. 
And by that logic, so are rappers, 
those who come up with and 
carry out the messages within 
the music.

But for some reason (it’s actu-

ally a specific and easy to under-
stand reason), rappers generally 
aren’t taken seriously, much less 
respected. Often times they’re 
instead played as pawns by 
upper-level executives in the 
music industry, chewed up and 
spit out after they fail to deliver 
any more hits.

A hit usually requires rap-

pers to fulfill cliché ideals of 
Blackness because, as Tricia 
Rose explains in “The Hip Hop 
Wars,” in the post-civil rights 
era America has developed 
an especially rife appetite for 
stereotyped entertainment. So 
maybe I take that back. Hip hop 
is alive, but maybe it’s not doing 
so well. In some senses, the 
state of hip hop is quite toxic. 

Since we’re keepin’ it real, let’s 
acknowledge the other factors 
Rose insists have synergistically 
created these toxic conditions. 
We’ve got new technologies, 
crazy corporate consolidation, 
a culture where violence and 
misogyny are valued, the never-
ending expansion of street 
economies and the industry 
manipulation I briefly men-
tioned. Oh, and racism — that’s 
still a thing. Damn.

Weren’t things supposed to 

get better post-Civil Rights Act? 
Interestingly enough, hip hop’s 
legacy isn’t the only one subject 
to distortion, which brings us 
back to Dr. King. Posthumously, 
things are going pretty well for 
King. In the only industrialized 
nation without paid maternity 
leave, having a day off of work 
is kinda like a big deal, but 
that’s what happens every third 
Monday in January when we 
celebrate the esteemed orator’s 
birthday. On a more serious 
note, though, Dr. King is widely 
regarded and revered as one of 
the most skilled, strategic activ-
ists of the Civil Rights Move-
ment — a leader ahead of his 
time. Now for a disclaimer: I’m 
about to draw some similarities 
between both the treatment and 
views of Dr. King and those of a 
few dope rappers, but don’t dis-
miss me yet, it’s with the best of 
intentions. My last hope is to in 
some way smear King’s legacy, 
which like that of rap is precise-
ly what happens way too often.

King made his way, right-

fully so, into our history books, 
but unfortunately he can also 
be found in the mouths of some 
of the most downright disre-
spectful dons of derailment. I’m 
talking about the people who 
have the audacity to ask why 
protesters are “rioting” instead 
of following King’s doctrine of 
nonviolence every time con-
cerned community members 
join forces and flood the streets 
after another unlawful and 
uncalled for police shooting. 
Tamir Rice. Tanisha Anderson. 
We should keep saying their 
names. And these derailment 
virtuosos do and ask a bunch of 
other bothersome things too, 
but they’re not the focus here. 
If you’d like to further discuss 
the difference between enact-
ing violence on disenfranchised 
peoples and those peoples’ reac-
tions, you can personally email 
me. But back to King. And back 
to hip hop — where rappers are 
often manipulated, both from 
the jump when signed to major 
record labels and through the 
twisted use of their lyrics as 
explanation and justification for 
the hopeless poverty they find 
themselves in. Ahem, fuck Bill 
O’Reilly. (Snoop said it, not me.)

Nonetheless, like King, many 

of these rappers continue to 
produce powerful music in 
which they continue to share 
their dreams. And many of these 
dreams resonate with those of 
Dr. King.

Let’s start in the South, as 

it’s the most overlooked. People 
really front everything from the 
drank in their cups and gold in 
their mouths, to the screwed-
up-and-chopped sounds of their 
music that didn’t all originate in 
the third coast. But I digress and 
will save that topic for another 
column. Dreams in the South 
stank like gasoline. Off the 
futuristic, funkadelic, unique 
utopia that is Outkast’s Stanko-
nia, nothing about “Gasoline 
Dreams” is dreamy. This shit 
sonically hits hard: an explo-
sive beat, over which Andre 
screams “burn motherfucka 
burn American dreams” — fit-
ting. It samples Geto Boyz’s 
“Crooked Officer,” also fitting, 
as Big Boi breaks down the rela-
tionship between racial identity, 
drugs and the law in his verse: 
Rich white kids inherit wealth, 
while poor Black ones inherit 
racial profiling and incarcera-
tion, often times due to drugs 
which didn’t end up in the hood 
on accident. “Fuck the Holice.” 
Dre can’t cope in his verse, 
while Khujo finds hope not in 
America, nor in Africa, but in 
death and Judgment Day. The 

American Dream has been cor-
rupted by crooked cops, gluttony 
and greed for Dre, Big Boi and 
the people of Atlanta. Let that 
shit burn then.

While we’re on the topic of 

explosions, in Nas’s video for 
“Street Dreams,” the Illmatic 
rhyme-slayer gets blown up in 
the final scene, a Hype-Williams-
directed take on “Casino.” But 
before his flame-filled, ficti-
tious death, Nas spends the 
track doing what he does oh so 
proficiently — storytelling. This 
track, and the album (It Was 
Written) itself, is still a source 
of contention: It’s Nas’s most 
commercially successful release 
to date, “Street Dreams” being 
his only hit single to go gold, 
but some fans and reviewers 
alike feel it was lacking. Maybe 
it was too drastic of a shift in 
sound, too pop, too palpable. But 
that palpability expanded Nas’s 
reach, giving newfound fans a 
taste of street dreams, a taste 
they otherwise wouldn’t have 
come across. Nas raps, “Grow-
ing up project-struck, lookin for 
luck, dreamin / Scoping the large 
n****s beaming, check what I’m 
seeing / Cars, ghetto stars push-
ing ill Europeans.” His dream is 
centered on the luxuries of life, 
like Beamers and other “ill Euro-
peans,” usually only afforded to 
white Americans of European 
descent. He just wants the shit to 
come full circle. And he’s willing 
to do whatever, including dabble 
in the drug game. The glamoriza-
tion of the crack business may 
not appeal to MLK, but what 
I’m trying to stress with “Street 
Dreams” is Nas’s relentless 
resolve to fulfill his dream “with-
out the FBI catching feelings.”

While Outkast set fire to the 

conditional, crooked American 
dream, and Nas gave his all to 
fulfill the well-known, wide-
spread street dream of making it 
out of the hood, the final dream 
we’ll look at is MC Breed’s, a 
dream fulfilled — unbelievably 
though. The late, great Breed 
hails from Flint, a city that’s at 
the center of the nation’s atten-
tion at the moment (has Gov. 
Snyder resigned yet?) but was 
virtually unknown in the rap 
game before Breed hit the scene. 
With the debut release of MC 
Breed & DFC in 1991, the MC put 
the Midwest on the map, but his 
sound would grow to be more 
reminiscent of the West, g-funk 
grooves, piercing synths and 
all, due to his move out to L.A. 
and constant collaboration with 
Too Short, D.O.C. and the like. 
In fact, Too Short’s staple pro-
ducer, Ant Banks, was behind 
“Dreamin’,” the lead single from 
his 1997 album Flatline. Breed 
had been in the game for a hand-
ful of years at this point, finally 
asking, “40-ounce-drinkin, 
wearing links and riding Lexus 
coup — am I dreamin?’ ” Nas 
convinced us he’d give his all to 
see his dreams come to fruition, 
but it seems like Breed has vic-
toriously done just that, and now 
needs a moment to reflect on all 
he’s overcome to achieve such 
a feat — making it out. Breed 
declares, “Either roll with me 
or get rolled on,” as he’s come 
too far to risk the progress he’s 
made. The last minute of the 
song is purely instrumental, giv-
ing Breed plenty of time to look 
back on his accomplishments as 
the track fades.

Dreams are important — 

whether it’s the deconstruction 
of deceitful ones, the tireless 
pursuit of transformative ones 
or the reflection upon the pains-
taking accomplishment of pur-
poseful ones. Whether they’re 
expressed by Civil Rights 
activists or local rappers, their 
validity stands and resonance in 
respective communities is real. 
Above all, if I’m going to spend a 
semester writing a biweekly col-
umn on hip hop, I felt it was in 
order to affirm the importance 
of hip hop and an integral part 
of hip hop — its dreams.

HIP-HOP COLUMN

MLK had a dream, 
and so does hip hop

I can’t look away 
from ‘Murderer’

Netflix’s challenging 
true-crime doc lives 

up to the hype

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

Small towns have their secrets.
I know, because I’m from one. 

My family lives in Ludington, 
Mich., a summer hotspot on the 
shore of Lake Michigan. Starting 
in June, our downtown is packed 
with ice cream-licking tourists, 
sunset watchers and sand dune 
hikers who never stray too far 
from the trail. They often buy 
tickets to board the S.S. Badger, a 
car ferry that ships directly across 
Lake Michigan to Manitowoc, 
Wis., a small town that mirrors 
our own.

Safe to say, Manitowoc is no lon-

ger known as just a lakeside retreat. 
Since “Making a Murderer” pre-
miered on Netflix in December, 
the 10-episode true-crime docu-
mentary has shined an unflatter-
ing light on the town and people of 
Manitowoc — uncovering violent 
crimes and the power that towns-
people (law enforcement included) 
have over undesirable members of 
the community. For instance, the 
power to sentence young Steven 
Avery to 18 years of prison for a 
crime he didn’t commit.

Before Avery becomes (or is 

made into) a murderer, as the show 
title implies, he’s undoubtedly a 
victim of the justice system. “Mak-
ing a Murderer” opens in the year 
1985, when Penny Beerntsen, wife 
of a well-respected business owner, 
was attacked while running on the 
shore of Lake Michigan. When 
the police heard her story, Steven 
Avery was labeled a prime suspect 
— he had a record of petty crimes, 
but more pertinently, he had beef 
with his cousin, the deputy sher-
iff’s wife — and though he had sev-
eral witnesses to his whereabouts, 
Avery was arrested. In the trial 
that followed, Avery was success-
fully prosecuted by the state and 
charged with first-degree sexual 

assault and attempted murder.

His case didn’t go unnoticed. 

The Wisconsin Innocence Proj-
ect, an organization committed 
to righting unjust convictions, 
took Avery under its wing. With 
improved DNA testing in the 
2000s, the organization was able 
to prove Avery’s innocence: they 
didn’t find Avery’s hair in the 
case evidence, but rather Gregory 
Allen’s, a serial sex offender in 
Manitowoc who was prone to vio-
lence. When the damning results 
came out in 2003, Avery was 
released from prison — and into 
the arms of attorneys eager to sue 
the court of Manitowoc.

What happened next is both 

heart wrenching and bewilder-
ing. In October 2005, Avery was 
in the process of filing a $36 mil-
lion federal lawsuit against Mani-
towoc County, when a body was 
found dead on his property — or 
the remains of one, anyway. Teresa 
Halbach, a reporter for Auto Trad-
er, had been sent to Avery’s junk 
yard to photograph cars for sales 
ads in the magazine. She arrived 
on Avery’s property on October 31; 
her bone fragments were discov-
ered 10 days later, buried in Avery’s 
fire pit. Halbach’s RAV4, hidden 
by plywood and brush, was found 
among the junk cars. Though Hal-
bach wasn’t in the vehicle, some-
thing else was: Steven Avery’s 
blood. And in a corner of Avery’s 
house, dropped on the floor, were 
the keys to her car.

Public opinion toward Avery 

shifted immediately. Once the 
poster child of wrongful convic-
tions, Avery was dropped from the 
Innocence Project’s files. News of 
the murder was picked up by the 
New York Times, which is how 
Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, 
both graduate film students at 
Columbia, heard about the case in 
2005 and decided it had the mak-
ings of a documentary. Over the 
next 10 years, the two traveled to 
Wisconsin on a shoestring budget, 
interviewing Avery’s family and 
attorneys, gathering hours of court 
footage and mining through thick 
police reports to create the film.

As it happens, 10 years was 

exactly how long the show needed 
to bake. With recent true crime 
series like HBO’s “The Jinx” and 
podcasts like “Serial” garnering 
massive media attention, “Making 
a Murderer” slid naturally into the 
same place. Like its predecessors, 
the series has the power to hook 
an audience — people like me, who 
are familiar with Manitowoc and 
know the power of small-town 
politics, or those who thrive off 
mysteries, like the hundreds of 
Reddit users who’ve posted their 
own theories about the case. Even 
top documentary filmmakers, talk 
show hosts and journalists from 
The New Yorker to Rolling Stone 
Magazine have turned their heads.

But despite the hype and its 

Netflix platform, “Making a Mur-
derer” isn’t a show to binge watch. 
It’s too frustrating, disturbing and 
frankly exhausting to view more 
than one episode in a sitting. Part 
of this is due to its bare-bones form, 
which relies almost exclusively on 
filmed interrogations, court trials 
and recorded phone calls between 
Avery and his family — conversa-
tions that aren’t so much illuminat-
ing as they are repetitive. A recent 
“Late Night With Seth Meyers” 
parodied these calls perfectly in 
Meyers’ skit, “Making a Talk Show 
Host”:

“Yah, Seth?” asks a collect call 

from New York.

“Yeah,” Meyers replies.
“Yah, you gotta come back. Ya 

know?”

“I’ve only been out two weeks,” 

Meyers says. “Two weeks I’ve been 
gone. I gotta come back? ... So, I 
gotta come back?”

Though “Making a Murderer” 

doesn’t have the constant action 
we’ve come to expect in a crime 
series, we have to remember what 
it is: not a fictional crime show, 
but a true story with real people, 
whose lives have been battered 
and stolen from them. Perhaps it’s 
this truth — the realness of Mani-
towoc and its citizens, their situ-
ations both horribly familiar and 
unbelievable — that makes it hard 
to look away.

‘M’ wins exhibition

Star freshman 
Connor injured 

late, Kile ejected for 

charging penalty

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Writer

It seemed odd that the No. 

6 Michigan hockey team had a 
scheduled exhibition game in 
January — 
normally, 
exhibition 
games take 
place before the regular season. 
They allow teams to knock off 
any lingering rust from the 
offseason, and they enable a 
coaching staff to evaluate their 
players in a game setting. 

It 
seemed 
especially 
odd 

because 
the 
opponent 
was 

the immensely talented U-18 
United States National Team 
Development Program.

However, the game couldn’t 

have been timelier. It allowed 
Michigan to rest some of its 
players — freshman forward 
Cooper 
Marody, 
senior 

netminder Steve Racine and 
sophomore defenseman Zach 
Werenski all got the night off. 
It also allowed the Wolverines 
to see what their lineup would 
look like without sophomore 
defenseman Cutler Martin and 
sophomore 
forward 
Dexter 

Dancs, 
who 
are 
suspended 

for 
three 
and 
two 
games, 

respectively, following an after-
game brawl against Ohio State 
last Sunday.

And while the Wolverines got 

off to a lackadaisical start, they 
finished in control, beating the 
USNTDP, 5-2, in a chippy game.

“Historically, it can be (a 

chippy game),” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “I can’t tell 
you why. I don’t think the players 

that have played in that program 
try and play chippy against the 
program kids. Sometimes the 
program kids are maybe mad 
that Michigan didn’t recruit 
them, and the kids we recruit 
want to put on a good showing. 
You never know what direction 
it is going to go.”

For a game in which only 

pride is on the line, a good 
outcome is one where you leave 
the game healthy and without 
suspensions. For Michigan, that 
might not hold true.

Late in the game, freshman 

sensation Kyle Connor took a 
spill into the boards and stayed 
down on the ice for a couple 
minutes before skating off under 
his power. Berenson said after 
the game that there will be an 
update on Connor’s condition 
Friday — the only outcome that 
matters from Thursday’s game.

Earlier, midway through the 

second period, junior forward 
Alex 
Kile 
was 
ejected 
for 

charging at Harvard commit 
Adam Fox. The NCAA will likely 
review the hit and determine 
any 
further 
consequences. 

Kile’s game misconduct was his 
second in as many games after 
he left the bench during the 
Ohio State fight.

The 
Americans 
showed 

the same fire, with Michigan 
defenseman 
commit 
Griffin 

Luce earning a game misconduct 
for a vicious hit on freshman 
Brendan Warren.

“Judging 
from 
last 
year, 

frustration sets in and it’s hard 
to get motivated for a game like 
this, but we responded well to 
it,” said sophomore forward 
Tony Calderone. “I think a 
couple guys got out of hand, but 
we did well.”

To open the game, NTDP 

coach 
Danton 
Cole 
started 

all five Michigan commits — 
forwards James Sanchez, Will 
Lockwood and Nick Pastujov 

as well as Luce and fellow 
defenseman Luke Martin. Next 
fall, those five will join the 
six NTDP alumni currently 
playing at Michigan, barring any 
unforeseen changes.

When 
the 
puck 
dropped, 

the game’s start was anything 
but similar to last weekend’s 
series against Ohio State. The 
Wolverines 
— 
averaging 
an 

astounding 4.86 goals per game 
— were largely held in check, 
mustering just seven shots in 
the first frame. And also unlike 
the previous weekend, Michigan 
held the NTDP scoreless until, 
just three minutes into the 
second frame, Pastujov threw 
a pass from the slot to Western 
Michigan 
commit 
Keenan 

Suthers, who sniped the puck 
past junior goaltender Zach 
Nagelvoort.

And the Wolverine offense 

finally awoke when it had its five-
minute power play chance. Thirty 
seconds into the man advantage, 
junior 
defenseman 
Michael 

Downing rifled a shot from the 
point that junior forward Tyler 
Motte banged home. Later, in 
the third period, Calderone beat 
Boston University commit Jake 
Oettinger on his glove side to give 
the Wolverines their first lead of 
the game. And less than a minute 
later, Motte extended the lead 
to two on a one-timer chance. 
Junior forward Max Shuart and 
Calderone’s second tally rounded 
out the team’s scoring.

ICE HOCKEY
Michigan recruits 
savor taste of Yost

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

With 
the 
Michigan 
band 

playing in the background and the 
Children of Yost being their usual 
rowdy selves, the United States 
National 
Team 
Development 

Program trotted out five of the 
nation’s best upcoming talent.

Except this time, it was a little 

different. Instead of starting the 
usual line of Boston University 
commits Kiefer Bellows and 
Clayton Keller and Minnesota-
Duluth commit Joey Anderson, 
USNDTP coach Danton Cole 
trotted out five future Michigan 
hockey players.

These 
players 
— 
forwards 

James Sanchez, Will Lockwood 
and Nick Pastujov and defensemen 
Luke Martin and Griffin Luce 
— represent five of the seven 
announced commits that will be 
playing in Ann Arbor next season.

“It was nice. They all play 

different positions, so all five could 
start,” Cole said. “It’s a big day for 
them, and they were excited. They 
played well, played strong.

“We have a lot of committed 

guys, and the guys are excited to 
play. It’s their first taste of playing 
in Yost and a college atmosphere. 
It’s always fun for them.”

For those five players, the game 

represents the first and probably 
last time they will be on the 
opposite side of the Children of 
Yost’s jeers. And for each player, 
the atmosphere is what brought 
many of them to Michigan.

“It’s a little insane, like the 

band is really overwhelming,” 
Pastujov said. “They’re really, 
really loud. That was one of the 
best college atmospheres we’ve 
played at this year, if not the best, 
and it was tough when the crowd 
gets into it to bounce back to try to 
find a way back.”

All five players found their way 

to a maize and blue jersey in a 
different way. But for Lockwood 
and Pastujov, it was the family 
connections that sealed the deal 
for them.

Lockwood’s father, Joe, played 

for Michigan coach Red Berenson’s 
first recruiting class from 1984 
to 1988. Lockwood, a Bloomfield 
Hills, Mich., native, also grew up 
a Wolverine fan his whole life. 
Knowing Joe played at Michigan 
made his son want to play for 
Michigan from an early age.

Pastujov, 
who 
is 
from 

Bradenton, Fla., has been playing 
junior hockey in Michigan for five 
years, and playing in Ann Arbor 
was something that naturally 
piqued his interest. But he also 
has a family connection to the 
Wolverines — his grandfather 
attended Michigan.

But even for an exhibition 

game, the game itself was chippy, 
something the USNTDP expected.

For 
some 
of 
the 
future 

Wolverines 
especially, 
they 

gave their future teammates a 
nice, physical introduction of 
themselves.

Luce was ejected from the 

game for a high hit, and Pastujov 
was sent to the box early in the 
game for getting into a scuffle 
with junior forward Evan Allen.

“I wasn’t making any friends 

out there, but I think that’s all 
right,” Pastujov said. “They know 
it’s a game.”

With the annual game against 

the USNTDP now out of the way, 
the future Wolverines are already 
looking toward next year’s game. 
For now, the USNTDP players 
will go back to finishing off their 
exhibition schedules, donning the 
navy blue USA jerseys.

But next year, they’ll trade in 

those jerseys for the maize and 
blue.

Michigan looks to reload 
with top freshman class

Team must replace 

Bektas, Dodge, 
Lee to win eighth 

straight Big Ten title

By ORION SANG

Daily Sports Writer

It would be understandable 

for a team that graduated the 
two winningest singles players in 
school history to take a step back 
the following year.

But the No. 14 Michigan 

women’s tennis team doesn’t 
have any plans to rebuild, and 
coach Ronni Bernstein believes 
the 
seven-time 
reigning 
Big 

Ten champion Wolverines will 
remain highly competitive.

“You would like to reload 

instead of rebuild,” Bernstein 
said. “I knew we had a lot to 
replace, and I think we did that.”

Part of the replacement of 

departing players comes from 
the development of incumbent 
players, as well as an incoming 
freshman 
class 
of 
Brienne 

Minor, Kate Fahey and Teona 
Velehorschi that will play a big 
role in determining Michigan’s 
season fate.

“I’m 
excited 
about 
our 

freshman class,” Bernstein said. 
“I think, tennis-wise and as 
people, that we did a really good 
job there. Hopefully, they can 
help us up high in the lineup, and 
their work ethic is really good.”

Minor and Fahey, in particular, 

will have to play well in the 
singles lineup for the Wolverines 
to be able to defend their Big Ten 
title. The two freshmen arrived on 
campus with a great deal of hype 
— they were ranked No. 9 and No. 
12 in the nation, respectively, by 
tennisrecruiting.net.

Both have lived up to the 

billing so far, sporting impressive 
records in both singles and 
doubles 
from 
fall 
season 

competition. 
Minor, 
who 
is 

ranked No. 19 in the country in 

singles, is 16-3 in singles and 11-2 
in doubles, while Fahey is 10-5 
and 8-4, respectively.

Senior captain Ronit Yurovsky 

was also complimentary of the 
freshmen.

“I think they’re a really good 

class,” Yurovsky said. “They 
practice so hard and care so 
much about the team. They play 
a big role on the team, and they’re 
going to have a big impact.”

While Michigan has reloaded 

with its freshman class, the 
Wolverines will have to combat 
their youth.

Yurovsky herself will have to 

play a larger role on the team as 
its most experienced returnee. 
She is the only senior on the team, 
and after ending last season 
ranked No. 25, she has climbed 
to No. 17 as the winter season 
begins.

Yurovsky, 

who 
has 

played mostly 
in Michigan’s 
No. 2 singles 
spot, will now 
presumably 
move to the 
first 
spot 

vacated 
by 

four-time All-
Big Ten player 
Emina Bektas.

Though Bektas’s shoes may 

seem big to fill, Yurovsky believes 
she’s up to the task.

“Nothing’s really changed,” 

Yurovsky 
said. 
“I’ve 
pretty 

much prepared the same as if I 
would every other year, but I’m 
starting to focus on playing with 
more confidence. I think that’s 
key especially if you’re playing 
higher up.”

In addition to playing at a higher 

spot in the lineup, Yurovsky will 
also need to be a leader for what 
is an exceptionally young team 
— the sole upperclassmen on the 
roster are Yurovsky and junior 
Sara Remynse.

Yurovsky credits last year’s 

captains with teaching her how 
to be an effective leader.

“(They) did a good job of 

showing you the ropes of what you 
do,” Yurovsky said. “I’ve definitely 
taken in what they’ve done, and 
it’s helped me for this year.”

As Michigan prepares for the 

upcoming 
dual-meet 
season, 

it will both try to find the 
best lineup and continue to be 
aggressive on the court.

During the fall season, the 

Wolverines were without many 
of their players due to injuries 
and illness, which has meant a 
fairly unsettled lineup.

“(The lineup) is going to work 

itself out,” Bernstein said. “Some 
of the kids that have played more 
are more match-tough right 
now. I’m excited that everyone is 
healthy again.”

Meanwhile, the Wolverines 

have been working on shortening 
points and being aggressive by 

doing 
drills 

that 
involve 

hitting 
approach shots 
and 
coming 

up to the net, 
which should 
help 
for 
the 

indoor portion 
of the season.

“What 
we 

preach is that 
you’ve 
gotta 

win the point,” Bernstein said. 
“(We’re) not going to stay back and 
grind and wait for them to miss. 
We’re going to come forward and 
put pressure (on them).”

Though Michigan is a young 

team in need of improvement, 
Yurovsky 
remains 
optimistic 

about the season.

“I think that once we get 

together as a group it will click,” 
Yurovsky said. “I think that we 
could do really well (once that 
happens).”

While still early, if Wolverines 

can gel as a team the way their 
captain wants while staying as 
aggressive as Bernstein desires, 
they’ll have a shot to make 
some noise when the NCAA 
Tournament rolls around.

Special teams takes leap 
from up-and-down 2014

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Editor’s Note: With the Michigan 

football team’s 2015 regular season 
in the books, the Daily looks back 
at the performance of each unit this 
year and looks ahead to the future in 
2016. In this edition: special teams.

You can credit now-departed 

special teams coordinator John 
Baxter, you can credit Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh, you can 
credit graduate transfers and 
rising upperclassmen — there’s 
plenty of deserved credit to go 
around. There are few units in 
the country that improved from 
2014 to 2015 as much as the No. 
12 Michigan football team’s 
special teams unit.

In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
2014 

campaign that resulted in a 
disappointing 5-7 record, special 
teams were a sore spot. Kicking, 
returning, punting, holding onto 
the football and even putting 11 
players on the field proved difficult 
for Michigan. In ESPN’s special 
teams efficiency, the Wolverines 
were 96th out of 128 teams.

This year, Michigan finished 

the season tied for 12th in the same 
category, and, despite a sluggish 
finish, the special teams unit had 
plenty more to hang its hat on.

Thanks to a group of kick and 

punt returners led by redshirt 
freshman Jabrill Peppers, the 
return game received a much-
needed 
boost, 
finishing 
the 

season third in kickoff return 
average and fourth in average 
field position.

Redshirt junior kicker Kenny 

Allen converted 15 of 16 field goals 
from inside 40 yards (18-for-22 
overall) and made all 48 of his 
extra point attempts.

Fifth-year 
senior 
graduate 

transfer Blake O’Neill blasted nine 
punts over 50 yards and pinned 
23 inside the 20-yard line. He also 
had the longest punt of the season 
in college football at 80 yards.

As a whole, the special teams 

unit 
looked 
vastly 
improved 

in 2015, and with one notable 
exception, it paid off.

HIGH 
POINT: 
Michigan’s 

special 
teams 
had 
its 
best 

games 
against 
Northwestern, 

Minnesota and Maryland, but the 
Wolverines’ 38-0 win over the 
13th-ranked Wildcats on Oct. 10 
was the best of the bunch.

Redshirt junior wide receiver 

Jehu Chesson took his third career 
kickoff return 96 yards to the 
house for Michigan’s first kickoff 
return touchdown since 2009 and 
first to open the game since 1992.

From there, Allen hit a career-

long 47-yard field goal, while 
O’Neill pinned three punts inside 
the 20, including a 59-yarder, in 
the blowout win.

LOW POINT: Though O’Neill 

boomed an 80-yard punt, the 
return game amassed 156 yards 
and Kenny Allen hit three field 
goals, Michigan’s special teams 
will forever take the blame for the 
team’s loss to Michigan State on 
Oct. 17.

When O’Neill fumbled the 

snap on a punt with 10 seconds 
to go and Michigan State’s 
Jalen Watts-Jackson returned 
the fumble for a game-winning 
touchdown as time expired, all of 
Michigan’s special teams success 
was forgotten, as was its chance at 
a Big Ten title.

THE 
FUTURE: 
Despite 

some uncertainty with special 
teams moving forward, the unit 
appears to be in good shape 
overall. Though Baxter has left 
to take on the same position at 
Southern California and O’Neill is 
graduating, everyone else should 
be back.

In good news, Allen showed 

potential to replace O’Neill in 
the Citrus Bowl with a 57-yard 
punt. Like the rest of the team, 
Michigan’s special teams return 
and bring in more talent than 
it loses, and next year, it has a 
chance to be, well, special.

For Robinson, success starts before the game

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

It’s 6:35 p.m., and Michigan 

doesn’t tip off against Maryland 
for another two and a half hours. 
Crisler Center is quiet, but Duncan 
Robinson just swaggered out from 
Michigan’s tunnel, sporting a 
gray long-sleeve Michigan shirt 
and headphones. The arena is 
practically empty, save for a few 
of Robinson’s teammates shooting 
on the court and a handful of 
ushers and stadium staff shuffling 
around the concourse.

The redshirt sophomore guard 

heads for the stands and makes 
himself comfortable in an aisle seat 
14 rows up, across from the bench 
Michigan will use in a few hours 
when it hosts the third-ranked 
Terrapins. For nearly 20 minutes 
he just sits there, legs sprawled out 
comfortably resting on the chair in 
front of him. He occasionally sips 
from his water bottle or scrolls for 
a new song on his phone — he’s a 
big G-Eazy fan — but for the most 
part, he does nothing. He just sits 
there and gazes around an empty 
stadium, thinking.

“I try to do that, just kind of, I 

guess see myself out there. Not 
meditation — but just kind of 
envisioning,” Robinson said.

So for 20 minutes he sits, 

envisions and thinks.

About 
what? 
Maybe 
the 

Wolverines’ game five nights prior 
at Purdue, when tight Boilermaker 
defense limited Robinson to just 
two makes on five attempts from 
3-point range.

That 
type 
of 
performance 

doesn’t bode well for Michigan — a 
team that’s been reliant on strong 
shooting to make up for its often-
undersized big men down low. 
Robinson has shot 57 percent from 
behind the arc in Michigan’s wins 
this season, but just 38 percent 
from deep in its five losses.

Robinson eventually leaves his 

seat and heads toward the court. 
He exchanges a handshake with 
an usher and grabs a ball — the 
first time he’s touched one all day. 

He doesn’t like to touch a ball on 
game day more than about two 
hours before tipoff. He read that 
Golden State Warriors guard 
Stephen Curry does that, tried it 
himself once and the habit stuck.

Tipoff is still two hours away, 

but Robinson’s pregame routine 
is well underway. He shoots six-
footers from straightaway and 
slowly inches his way back toward 
the free throw line, and eventually, 
the 3-point line. He takes his first 
several 3s flat-footed, without 
jumping — a warm-up technique 
he learned from a trainer a while 
back. He begins moving around 
the arc, starting to find a rhythm. 
He lets off quick attempts, mixing 
it up a little each time. He takes a 
dribble and fires, makes a move 
and aims, pump fakes, elevates 
and releases with a hand in his 
face.

After 10 minutes of knocking 

down shots, he heads for the locker 
room. He gets taped up, changes 
into a blue Michigan T-shirt and is 
back out 30 minutes later. Tipoff is 
just an hour and a half away, and 
now Robinson’s routine gets more 
intense. He works his way around 
the arc, firing from every spot. A 
team manager grabs his rebounds 
and feeds the ball back to him.

Shot. Swish. Repeat.
He goes until he gets 100 

makes. It doesn’t take him many 
more attempts to do that.

“It kind of depends on the 

day — I try to keep it under like 
120 (attempts),” Robinson said. 
“Usually 20 misses, something like 
that. Depends how it’s feeling.”

He makes his 100th 3-pointer, 

ends with a handful of free throws 
and heads back to the tunnel. He 
comes back out later for team 
warmups, but his own personal 
routine is complete, and he has 
to wait until game time to see if it 
pays off.

It 9:00 p.m. now and Crisler 

Center isn’t so quiet anymore. 
Robinson is done envisioning 
himself on the court — he is on the 
court. Five minutes into the game, 
Robinson catches a pass from 

sophomore guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman on the left side of 
the arc. He pump fakes — exactly 
like he practiced two hours prior 
— and Maryland forward Jake 
Layman bites hard. Robinson 
dribbles once to his right, fires 
and hits, putting Michigan up 11-6 
early.

Ten 
minutes 
later, 
junior 

guard Zak Irvin finds Robinson 
in the corner. Maryland guard 
Melo Trimble tries to throw 
a hand in Robinson’s face, but 
Robinson ignores it just like he 
did the ones managers threw 
up at him earlier. The Williams 
College 
(Mass.) 
transfer 
hits 

again. Two possessions later, 
Abdur-Rahkman feeds Robinson, 
this time on the right shoulder 
of the arc. Robinson disregards 
Layman’s defense and nails a trey 
— erasing Maryland’s brief 25-24 
lead — one the Terrapins wouldn’t 

get back.

With less than three minutes 

in 
the 
half, 
Abdur-Rahkman 

finds Robinson again, this time in 
transition. Robinson catches and 
fires. On his way down, he gets 
taken out by Trimble, who tried 
his best to make sure Robinson 
didn’t have a clean look. As 
Robinson falls , so does his shot.

In the second half, the first 

time he has a look from deep he 
nails it. With Maryland making 
a comeback attempt late in the 
frame, Robinson has a chance to 
swing the momentum. Sophomore 
guard Aubrey Dawkins finds him 
all alone in the corner and, as 
Robinson aims, Dawkins and an 
entire student section lift their 
arms to preemptively celebrate 
a made 3. The ball rattles off the 
near rim and goes out of bounds. 
Robinson can’t believe it.

“I aimed it, I didn’t shoot it,” 

Robinson said. “I found myself so 
open that I just didn’t really know 
what to do with it, so it didn’t 
really come off right. I knew as 
soon as I shot it wasn’t good, so it 
was frustrating.”

What 
wasn’t 
frustrating, 

though, 
was 
his 
overall 

performance 
that 
night. 
He 

finished 5-of-9 from deep and 
tallied 17 points to help Michigan 
take its first home win over a top-
three team since 1997.

After Maryland missed a 3 at 

the end of the game that would 
have tied it, Robinson grabbed the 
rebound as time expired. He was 
the first Wolverine back in the 
tunnel and greeted his teammates 
with high fives and shouts as they 
came in.

Wednesday, when Michigan 

hosted Minnesota, he was one of 
the first out of the tunnel and it was 
the same pregame routine. Two 

hours before tip, Robinson sat and 
envisioned himself on the court, 
made his 100 3s, then headed 
back to the tunnel. This night, 
though, the preparation didn’t 
show like it did against Maryland. 
In a game in which Michigan 
as a whole struggled to find its 
shooting rhythm, Robinson wasn’t 
immune, going 3-for-10 from 
deep as the Wolverines edged the 
Gophers, 74-69.

But for Robinson, routine leads 

to rhythm. So when Rutgers comes 
to town next Wednesday, don’t 
expect the sharpshooter to change 
his pregame activities. He’ll come 
out of Michigan’s tunnel, envision 
himself playing from the stands, 
make his shots and then hope for 
a performance more like the one 
against Maryland than the one 
against Minnesota.

Then he’ll head back into the 

tunnel and wait to do it for real.

Redshirt sophomore forward Duncan Robinson is shooting 51.6 percent on 3-point attempts this season, the best of any Wolverine and 11th in the country.

Ohio State holds off 
Michigan comeback

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

At every Michigan women’s 

basketball 
game, 
during 
a 

timeout, a previously conducted 
interview of a Wolverine is 
displayed 
on 
the 

Crisler 
Center 
video board. One of the questions 
asked is, “What is your favorite 
Michigan basketball memory?”

Nearly every non-freshman 

Wolverine this season thus far 
has responded with last year’s 
overtime win against Ohio State.

Thursday, 
Michigan 
had 

another opportunity to make 
a lasting memory against the 
seventh-ranked Buckeyes, but the 
Wolverines ultimately fell, 97-93.

Ohio State’s full-court press 

was relentless from the opening 
tip, as it stole two inbound 
passes, pushing its lead to eight 
about four minutes into the first 
quarter. After another Buckeye 
steal and score, Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico was forced 
to call a timeout down by 10. 
Bolstered by suffocating defense, 
the Buckeyes took a 31-17 lead 
into the second quarter.

“Sometimes the tempo of 

the game can always change, 
depending on what team has the 
momentum,” said senior guard 
Madison Ristovski. “So we just 
have to stay within ourselves and 
play basketball the Michigan way 
(when Ohio State is on a run).”

About two minutes into the 

frame, Ristovski inbounded the 
ball and knew she was close to a 
five-second violation. She hastily 
tossed the ball, and the Buckeyes’ 
Kelsey Mitchell leaped for the 
steal and turned it into a quick 
layup to give her team a 15-point 
lead for her 17th point of the game.

With 6:51 left in the quarter, 

sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty 
knocked 
down 
a 

3-pointer 
after 
starting 
the 

contest 1-for-7 from the floor. 
After Ristovski knocked down 
two straight 3-pointers nearing 
the end of the quarter, Ohio 
State’s Mitchell knocked down 
one of her own to continue her 
torrid scoring pace as she finished 
with 27 in the scoring column.

Despite Mitchell’s prowess, 

the Wolverines trailed by just 
seven going into the half, 49-42. 
Michigan also has a Kelsey 
Mitchell on its roster, and the 
Wolverines’ senior forward led 
the team with 12 points on 6-for-7 
shooting at the half.

The third quarter started off 

with 
scorching-hot 
shooting. 

After Flaherty drained a 3-pointer 
to cut the lead back to seven with 
six minutes left in the quarter, the 
Buckeyes were shooting 9-for-13 
from behind the arc.

“Every time we made a great 

run, they had 
an answer to 
it,” 
Barnes 

Arico 
said. 

“That’s a sign 
of a top team in 
the country.”

Shortly 

after, 
Ohio 

State 
sunk 

another 
trey, 

forcing Barnes Arico to call a time 
out with 4:05 left in the quarter, 
down by 12. With just under 
two minutes left in the frame, 
the Buckeyes cut off Michigan’s 
growing momentum by holding 
the ball for a full minute due to 
three offensive rebounds. They 
ended the possession with a layup 
and another 3-pointer by Mitchell, 
carrying a 12-point advantage into 
the final 10 minutes.

Junior guard Siera Thompson 

started the fourth quarter with a 
jumper. Freshman guard Boogie 
Brozoski later hit a 3-pointer 
and sophomore forward Jillian 
Dunston took a charge on the 
ensuing possession, trying to gain 
momentum. Brozoski, however, 
turned the ball over trying to rifle 

a pass into the paint, leading to 
another Ohio State basket.

After a timeout, Flaherty — who 

scored a team-high 22 points — 
made another shot from behind 
the arc, only to have the Buckeyes 
halt the run with two baskets. 
Ohio State continued to show its 
strength on defense, blocking 
freshman center Hallie Thome 
and stealing another inbound pass.

The 
Wolverines 
forced 
a 

turnover at half court with 2:42 
left in the contest, and Thome 
capped off the possession with 
a layup to cut the lead to nine. 
About a minute later, Thome sunk 
a free throw to complete an and-1, 
trimming the deficit to five.

“We 
have 
a 
no-give-up 

mentality,” Thompson said. “We 
know we can play with any team 
in this conference, so that’s our 
mindset going into every game.”

Michigan 

forced 
the 

Buckeyes into 
a 
miss 
with 
 

the shot clock 
winding down 
in 
the 
next 

possession, 
but Ohio State 
grabbed 
the 

offensive 

rebound. After a foul, Buckeye 
guard Ameryst Alston hit one of 
her two free throws to push the 
lead to six. When the Wolverines 
got the ball, Thompson was also 
fouled, and she knocked down 
both of her attempts from the 
charity stripe, cutting it to just a 
four-point difference.

Michigan came within three 

points of the Buckeyes, but it 
couldn’t play catch up after Ohio 
State was nearly perfect from the 
free throw line down the stretch.

“In the locker room, we talked 

about the ability to keep fighting 
and keep fighting,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We believe that if we keep 
improving and we keep plugging 
along, that these games are going 
to go our way.”

Wolverines outshot in loss

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

Ohio State is particularly good 

at 3-point shooting, something 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico 

highlighted in her weekly radio 
interview with WTKA. 

Barnes Arico was not wrong, 

either. 
The 
Buckeyes 
wasted 

no time showing just how good 
they were, going 6-for-9 in the 
first half of Thursday’s contest. 
The impressive shooting display 
killed an aggressive start by the 
Wolverines and any chance they 
had of completing and upset over 
the No. 7 team in the country.

Michigan, a good shooting team 

in its own right, tried to go shot for 
shot with Ohio State from beyond 
the arc, and it nearly succeeded. 
But the Wolverines couldn’t quite 
keep up with the efficiency of their 
opponents in a 97-93 defeat.

All in all, the two teams 

combined for 48 3-point attempts, 
with Ohio State making 54.5 
percent of its deep shots.

Buckeye guard Kelsey Mitchell, 

the Big Ten’s leading scorer, hit 
the first 3-pointer of the contest 
with 
5:45 
remaining 
in 
the 

first quarter. Sophomore guard 
Katelynn Flaherty answered for 
the Wolverines just 19 seconds later 
with one of her own, but Ohio State 
immediately hit another on the 
other end, cutting short Michigan’s 
attempt to gain ground.

Mitchell and Flaherty each went 

5-for-8 from 3-point range on the 
night and led their teams’ scoring, 
with 27 and 22 points, respectively.

The final shot of the string of 

threes sparked a 12-0 run for the 
Buckeyes, resulting in a 16-point 
lead at the end of the first quarter 
that the Wolverines were never 
quite able to overcome. Though 
Michigan finished the game with 
11 made 3s to Ohio State’s 12, it 
took them four more attempts to 

reach that total.

Part of what contributed to 

the high number of shots was the 
personnel on the court.

“Ohio 
State 
is 
interesting 

because they play four guards and 
a post,” said senior guard Madison 
Ristovski. “So a lot of the time, we 
had four guards out there.”

Added Barnes Arico: “We stat 

plus-minus and, at halftime ... 
our smaller lineup was a positive 
number, so we decided at that 
point to try to play smaller as 
much as we could.”

With more guards spreading 

the floor, space opened up for 
freshman center Hallie Thome to 
take advantage, and she did just 
that. All but six of her 21 points 
came in the second half. Thome 
also collected 12 rebounds to earn 
her the second double-double of 
her short career.

Though the Wolverines fell 

short, they showed they can shoot 
with the best of them.
