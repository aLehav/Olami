ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

“What can we do now?” was the 

question for many after President 
Donald Trump’s election win back 
in November, particularly at the 
Women’s March — a day after his 
inauguration in January — which 
saw thousands of women protest 
Trump’s policies and behaviors 
towards women and minorities. 
Many activists considered his 
presidency 
the 
embodiment 

of discriminatory policies and 
thought.

After the end of the afternoon’s 

main event, one of the Women’s 
March co-chairs, Linda Sarsour, 
told all women to “get to work.” 
The Women’s Convention, set 
in the Cobo Center of Detroit, 
was organized around the idea 
of giving women and allies the 
political tools to understand the 
problems in the country and 
turning concerns into action. 
A central message seen this 
weekend was to support female 
politicians in 2018, when Congress 
is up for grabs.

Despite 
the 
priciness 
of 

the event — tickets were $295 
— 
scholarships 
and 
group 

registrations were provided, over 
5,000 were in attendance from 
across the country.

The host city was also a focus 

in the discussions across the three 
nights — according to Sarsour, 
Detroit represents many of the 
systematic concerns the speakers 
and panelists hoped to address.

“We 
actually 
intentionally 

chose Detroit as a place we 
wanted to invest our resources 
in,” Sarsour said earlier this year 
in the Detroit Free Press. “As a city 
that reflected a lot of the issues 
that people were working on 
across the country with poverty, 
police brutality, gentrification, we 
thought there was a lot of really 
great organizing already going 
on in Detroit and wanted to give a 
platform to those organizers with 
the conference.”

The morning welcome saw 

#MeToo founder Tarana Burke 
and actress Rose McGowan; 
#MeToo is the hashtag created to 
bring awareness of the prevalence 
of sexual assault and harassment 
in women’s lives, created shortly 
after the take down of former 
media mogul Harvey Weinstein.

Friday evening saw prominent 

female 
politicians, 
including 

Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y., 
and U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, 
D-Mich., 
as 
an 
emphasis 

throughout the event was the 
importance of electing women in 

office. According to the Women’s 
March organizers, more than 
20,000 women have committed 
to run for office.

“Do not wait for some white 

knight in Washington,” Gillibrand 
said. “It is the grassroots ... it is 
you. The resistance is you.”

Lawrence expanded on the 

concept of losing birth control 
but still having Viagra covered by 
insurance companies. 

“The 
conversation 
changes 

when a woman takes a seat at 
Billy Stevens still hadn’t let go of 

the trophy. 

Not when he got on the 

bus 
to 
Baltimore-Washington 

International Airport. Not when 
he got landed in Detroit. Not for the 
bus ride back to Ann Arbor, either. 
He said he couldn’t let it out of his 
sight.

And really, can you blame him?
The Michigan men’s soccer team 

was the Big Ten champion. It took 
104 minutes, but the 17th-ranked 
Wolverines topped No. 9 Maryland, 
2-1, in College Park. 

No one could have seen this 

coming.

Last season, the Wolverines 

finished with four wins in 19 
games. Two years before that, 
Stevens came to Ann Arbor as a 
member of the No. 2 recruiting 
class in the nation, only to finish 
with six victories.

But Michigan held a meeting 

after the 2016 season, one that 
ended with an unsurprising loss to 
the top-ranked Terrapins. Stevens 
doesn’t remember exactly when it 
happened. He remembers what it 
was about.

The University of Michigan 

is no stranger to outer space. 
Now, with the closure of the 
University’s 
Bicentennial, 

a first-ever time capsule — 
containing 
information 
all 

about a modern Michigan — will 
be launched into the cosmos.

The Michigan Bicentennial 

Archive, 
 
referred 
to 
as 

“M-BARC”, hosted a panel 
Friday afternoon in Stamps 
Auditorium 
to 
reveal 
the 

finished 
Bicentennial 
time 

capsule. 
The 
capsule 
was 

presented 
to 
the 
students 

who created it, and includes 
interviews from hundreds of 
members of the University 
of 
Michigan 
community 

including 
students, 
faculty, 

staff and alumni to give future 
generations a clear image of 
what the University was like 
during its bicentennial year. 

The event began with various 

speakers including University 
President Mark Schlissel and 
Gary Krenz, executive director 
of 
the 
Bicentennial 
office. 

The 
event 
continued 
with 

M-BARC’s panel, in which 
students showed videos of the 
process, answered questions 
regarding the creation of the 
time capsule and unveiled the 
finished product.

“The 
M-BARC 
project 

represents 
a 
new 
chapter 

in 
Michigan 
research 
and 

educational 
excellence, 
and 

also in Michigan ambition,” 
Schlissel said during the event. 
“The M-BARC project unites 
the extraordinary talents of the 

Bicentennial 
time capsule

“Arriving Home” art installment reflects 
on dedication, diversity of faculty, staff 

Students, 
faculty 
and 

community members gathered 
together in Ingalls Mall to 
watch HAILstorm! on Friday 
night, the 3-D light show that 
paid tribute to the University 
of Michigan’s 200 year legacy. 
The show was projected on 

the outside of the Rackham 
Building, 
and 
was 
deemed 

the pinnacle of the University

Bicentennial 

Celebrations. It was produced 
by 
the

Bluewater

and 

Maxin10sity, 
and 
featured 

a wide variety of high-tech 
graphics and animation. Along 
with 
the

there 
was 

music, food and festivities for 

Pop-up 
tents 
and 
exhibits 

showcasing the future of the

the Diag on Friday as the 
University concluded celebrations 
for its Bicentennial. 

The events began with the 

dedication of a new statue called 
“Arriving Home” — a stainless 
steel and acrylic spiral which 
reflects 
colors 
that 
change 

depending on time of day and 
sun angle — located near the C.C. 
Little Science Building. According 
to Diane Vasquez, co-founder of

MONDAY MEMORIES

PETER SERLING/Daily

Climate change and options for 

supporting the environment were 
among the central topics discussed 
at the Climate Change Summit 
Friday, where seven panelists — 
each with a career related to the 
environment and sustainability 
— discussed the best ways to 
contribute to climate research 
and 
environmental 
stability. 

The event was moderated by 
SEAS Dean Jonathan Overpeck 
and was part of the SEAS 
Opening Ceremonies.

Sean Watkins, community 

manager 
at 
the 
Solutions 

Project 
— 
an 
organization 

committed to a conversion to 
100 percent renewable energy 
— said one of the reasons he is 
most passionate about climate 
change is for the dialogues it 

entails, much like those at the 
panel.

“It’s having this conversation, 

having this conversation with 
people who don’t always look 
like who you look like, to really 
further the conversation about 
not only how is climate change 
affecting 
folks 
in 
different 

communities 
around 
the 

country and around the world 
but how folks are acting in their 
own communities at their own 
levels to really create change,” 
he said.

Kait Parker, a meteorologist 

at Weather.com and ABC News, 
said the human aspect of climate 
change is most important to her. 
She also pointed to a need for 
mitigation.

“As a meteorologist, I have 

been there as people have died 
in natural disasters and those 
are getting worse,” she said. 
“So how do we communicate 

the steps that need to be taken 
to mitigate those results? How 
do we get people to build in the 
areas that are safer and build 
safer homes? How do we help 
people and communicate that 
this natural disaster is linked 
in X, Y and Z ways to these 
actions?”

She said it is important to 

be on the front end of disasters 
rather than cleaning up after 
the fact.

To Parker’s point, Varun 

Sivaram, Douglas Dillon Fellow 
and acting director at the 
Council on Foreign Relations, 
said he agrees mitigation is 
extremely important but that 
to mitigate at a global level 
is going to require energy 
transformations at a scale and 
speed the world has never seen 
before. The Council on Foreign 
Relations is a nonpartisan 
think 
tank 
that 
addresses 

foreign policies issues.

“We do not have the energy 

and technology we need today 
to achieve a decarbonized 
world,” he said. “In order 
to get there we’re going to 
need to invest heavily in 
innovation.”

Sivaram 
said 
he 
enjoys 

studying 
the 
environment 

in science labs, the business 
sector and through a public 
policy lens, as each angle 
contributes differently to the 
discovery of new technology. 

Building off Sivaram’s talk 

of innovation, Ben Bunker, 
a 
University 
alum 
and 

CEO at Global Brightlight 
Foundation, a nonprofit that 
aims to bring solar power to 
people 
without 
electricity, 

said 
certain 
existing 

technologies 
are, 
in 
fact, 

capable of making a change. 
Bunker currently works to 
assist rural communities in 
Latin America.

security blanket. Something 
that I know will protect me and 
take care of me if I need it.”

Unlike 
tenure-tracked 

faculty, lecturers must renew 
their fixed-term employment 
contracts 
whenever 
they 

expire. Lecturers at the Ann 
Arbor and Dearborn campuses 
teach a third and half of all 
available student credit hours, 
respectively.

Shelley Manis, LEO Ann 

Arbor co-chair and lecturer 
IV in the Sweetland Center, 
started the minor in writing 
program and has been working 
at the Ann Arbor campus for 
seven years.

“We are not necessarily any 

different 
from 
tenure-track 

faculty and yet we are on a 
lower rung on the hierarchy 
and we think it’s time for that 
to stop,” Manis said.

Ashley 
Lucas, 
associate 

professor of Theatre & Drama, 
is an ally for LEO and spoke at 
the rally. According to Lucas, 
lecturers have more in-person 
contact with students on a daily 
basis and are an integral part to 
her own work as director of the 
Prison Creative Arts Project.

“I think you all deserve 

the salaries, job security and 
all the benefits that are equal 
to tenure-track folks,” Lucas 
said. “We need to keep fighting 
together. 
One 
faculty, 
one 

University.”

Manis 
has 
worked 
with 

LEO organizers over the past 
year to put together a platform 
bargaining 
for 
salary 
and 

benefits 
such 
as 
increased 

pay, reliable health care and 
minimum year-term contracts. 
LEO surveyed members to 
inquire what they wanted most 
out of the bargaining session. 
According to Manis, members 
overwhelmingly 
wanted 

increased wages.

According to Bill Emory, 

campus organizer for Flint and 
Ann Arbor North Campus, each 
University campus has different 
minimum wage salaries with a 
40 percent wage gap — $27,300 
for Flint, $28,300 for Dearborn 
and $34,500 for Ann Arbor.

As a Flint lecturer, Gelderloos 

emphasized not only the need 
for increased wages for all 
lecturers but also for closing 
the wage gap among all three 
campuses.

“I think we feel pretty 

united as a union. We do teach 
more and we are paid less, but 
I think the union does work 
for all of us,” Gelderloos said. 
“I am not envious that (Ann 
Arbor lecturers) are paid more 
than us, but if we are all one 
union and all one school with 
students getting the Michigan 
experience, I think the pay 
should be more equitable across 
campuses.”

Some 
lecturers 
rely 
on 

benefits from the state due to 
their low salaries. With many 
living below the poverty line, 
Manis explained that these 
burdens affect teaching in the 
classroom.

“We want lecturers to be able 

to afford to spend their time 

on their teaching rather than 
constantly spending their time 
trying to prove that they’re 
good enough teachers to keep 
their jobs,” Manis said. “We 
love what we do and we just 
want to be recognized more 
financially so that we can afford 
to live here and afford to keep 
doing these jobs.”

In 
terms 
of 
healthcare, 

Emory explains in order for a 
lecturer to receive healthcare 
from the University, the number 
of credit points they teach must 
be within a 50 percent, half-
credit load, and 75 percent, 
3-credit load, range. Rather 
than 
lecturers’ 
healthcare 

fluctuating depending on their 
number of credits taught each 
semester, LEO is bargaining for 
the University to average their 
credit points over the semesters 
for lecturers to have a more 
reliable healthcare source.

The union is also fighting for 

more health care subsidies for 
parents with young children 
and for single parents, whose 
low salaries put a burden on 
child care costs.

“One woman was being paid 

$28,000 per year and child care 
costs $22,000 per year,” Manis 
said.

The lecturer review process 

is more extensive compared 
to the tenure-track reviews. 
Manis explains the University 
holds interim reviews for the 
first three or four semesters 
and later conducts two major 
reviews. Lecturers must go 
through this process every 
three years with the first three 
reviews tied to renewal of their 
contracts.

“We feel like they should 

know after twelve years if we’re 
good enough to stay,” Manis 
said. “Our review packets are 
roughly the size and the rigor 
of tenured review packets but 
the tenure-track faculty goes 
through that process once.”

Through 
this 
bargaining 

campaign, LEO wants more 
guaranteed renewals and fairer 
performance evaluations. The 
union believes this can be done 
by simplifying the system and 
eliminating redundancy.

The lecturer tier system 

plays a large role in how 
lecturers are treated in the 
review and renewal process. 
There are two separate tracks 
— lecturer I/II which include 
solely teaching appointments, 
and 
lecturer 
III/IV 
which 

include 
additional 
service 

responsibilities. Lecturer III/
IV have stronger job security, 
since they have passed major 
reviews. According to Manis, 
some lecturer Is are hired on 
a semester basis and will not 
know until December if they 
will be teaching next term.

“Lecturer I’s are in a really 

precarious situation because 
(the University) can lay them 
off or bring them back at will. 
That not only means that they 
can’t prep appropriately, but 
that also means that they can’t 
budget,” Manis said. “They 
don’t know where their next 
paycheck is coming from.”

However, lecturer IVs also 

hit a wage-earning ceiling. 
Manis highlighted lecturer IVs 
will never have a significant 
increase after reaching this 

level and can only achieve 
salary increases with these 
bargaining sessions.

“I am 42 years old, my 

earning potential will top out 
after my major review session 
this January,” Manis said.

According to Manis, due 

to the rigorous nature of the 
review process, lecturers are 
unable to teach to the best of 
their abilities in the classroom.

“Because our review process 

is one that makes our jobs not as 
secure and stable, it oftentimes 
means that lecturers aren’t 
going to take risks as much in 
the classroom to try new things 
because there isn’t as much 
room to fail splendidly,” Manis 
said.

The main issue of lecturer 

salary 
also 
plays 
into 
the 

student experience. Gelderloos 
highlighted that when lecturers 
are working several jobs, they 
do not have the time or energy 
to 
put 
effort 
into 
quality 

teaching.

“It’s in the University’s best 

interest to have faculty who are 
good at what they do and our 
students deserve someone who 
doesn’t just teach part-time 
here and there to make ends 
meet but deserve people who 
have been teaching for while, 
who are good at what they do,” 
Gelderloos said. “I think the 
students get a better education 
from more seasoned and less 
overworked professors.”

Although 
many 
elements 

factor into the review and 
renewal of a lecturer’s contract, 
the review committee takes 
teacher 
evaluations 
into 

significant consideration. What 
many students do not realize is 
their lecturers’ jobs depend on 
the evaluations.

“It always takes two or three 

times when a new course starts 
to get it to really work exactly 
the way you want it to and 
because 
student 
evaluations 

are so important, that can 
sometimes put a chilling effect 
on innovation,” Manis said.

In spite of this, Manis still 

encourages 
students 
to 
be 

honest in their evaluations and 
emphasizes that the review 
results are never at the fault of 
the student.

Academia-bound 
graduate 

students’ futures also depend 
on 
LEO’s 
work. 
Rackham 

student Rachel Miller, president 
of 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization, 
spoke 
about 

the 
implications 
of 
these 

bargaining sessions.

“You are our future. You are 

where we are heading,” Miller 
said. “And only 17 percent of 
the current faculty teaching 
in higher education are in 
tenured-track, so your fight is 
our fight and your fight today is 
our fight in the future.”

Due 
to 
the 
wide 
range 

of concerns, LEO will hold 
bargaining 
sessions 
every 

Friday until contracts terminate 
in April 2018, according to 
Emory.

“You’re spending so much 

time putting together materials 
to prove that you’re an excellent, 
rigorous, present teacher, that 
it’s harder to be an excellent, 
rigorous, present teacher in the 
classroom because your mind is 
divided,” Manis said.

students today across different 
disciplines while also issuing a 
challenge to the students of the 
future.”

The students who helped 

to create the time capsule had 
the responsibility of collecting 
interviews 
and 
information 

in a way that would represent 
the 
community 
and 
would 

be 
relevant 
in 
a 
century. 

The project team was led by 
Hashmita 
Koka, 
a 
recently 

graduated aerospace engineer, 
as well as other important 
members of the team including 
Engineering graduate students 
Aakar Sheth and Connor Bluhm, 
and faculty lead Aaron Ridley, 
professor of climate and space 
sciences and engineering. The 
team also had non-engineers to 
offer alternative perspectives 
when gathering interviews.

M-BARC’s unique challenge 

is that in 100 years students 
will have to figure out how to 
bring the time capsule back to 
Earth and read the encoded 
interviews. The time capsule 
also contains the words of the 
song “The Yellow and Blue” 
embedded in DNA sequences, 
which will allow future students 
to study the effect of radiation 
in space on DNA.

“This was the first official 

event with the Bicentennial 
committee, and it was really 
great to talk about it and to share 
our experiences working on the 
team,” Koka said. “I hope that 
100 years from now people will 
actually go back and retrieve 
(the time capsule).”

The panel of students held 

a Q&A session, during which 
members 
of 
the 
audience 

inquired 
about 
the 
many 

technicalities of the project. 
One of the students present 
in the audience was Music, 
Theatre & Dance sophomore 

Zoha Bharwani.

“I 
didn’t 
realize 
how 

extensive it (the project) was,” 
Bharwani said. “I think it’s so 
cool because it bridged so many 
diverse groups of people and 
so many different schools of 
thought.”

At the conclusion of the 

event, the audience was given 
3-D printed models of the time 
capsule itself, which featured 
the Block ‘M’ on one side, as they 
exited the auditorium. Prof. 
Ridley said the idea to have the 
audience leave with a miniature 
version of the time capsule came 
from the students.

“The 
students 
have 
been 

unbelievable throughout this, 
and they’ve pushed really hard,” 
Ridley said. “A lot of the faculty 
led initiatives are the faculty 
saying you do this and this, but 
really it’s been the students 
who’ve driven the whole thing.”

The launch date for the 

time capsule is expected to be 
sometime in May 2018.

spectators to enjoy. 

Gary 
Krenz, 
executive 

director 
of 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
Bicentennial, 

explained 
the 
goal 
of 

HAILstorm! was to take people 
through the history of the 
University with an exciting 
presentation.

“It’s a 3-D projection mapping 

light show on the façade of 
Rackham,” Krenz said. “It’s 
going to incorporate all kinds of 
stuff from the history, present 
and future of U of M-lots of 
lights, lots of motion, a huge 
amount of energy. People are 
really going to enjoy it.”

Krenz also reflected on the 

Bicentennial celebrations as a 
whole. He discussed how even 
though the University enjoys 
showcasing all the good it has 
accomplished over the last 200 

years, it’s also important to 
come together as a community 
to understand the areas where 
the institution fell short.

“When 
you 
reach 
an 

anniversary like this, you really 
can pull the whole community 
together to reflect,” Krenz said. 
“Part of this is to celebrate how 
great we are, but part of it is 
also to think about where we’ve 
made some mistakes, and how 
do we think about that as we go 
forward.”

Rackham 
student 
Kaitlyn 

Portal echoed Krenz’s statement 
about the value of bringing 
the community together. She 
also pointed out recent racist 
incidents on campus show the 
University still has areas it 
needs to improve on.

“I like the way that they 

focused on bringing the U of 
M community together, and 
identified ways that we can 
improve 
ourselves-especially 

recently with the racial events 
on campus,” Portal said. “I 

think the campus still has issues 
it needs to work on. But, I think 
events like tonight’s really show 
us how we come together as a 
community.”

Along 
with 
areas 
for 

improvement, LSA senior Aiya 
Saad was very impressed with 
the Bicentennial showcase of 
new technology the University 
is developing. Saad explained 
she looks forward to seeing the 
diverse range of innovations 
University students and faculty 
create.

“I hope Michigan keeps doing 

what they’re doing. I’ve seen 
a lot of what people have been 
working on in different areas of 
campus, and I was so amazed. I 
hope to see more of that going 
forward,” Saad said.

Krenz hopes the Bicentennial 

celebrations 
allowed 
people 

to reflect on the University’s 
legacy, 
understand 
the 

challenges it has faced and 
obtain a stronger historical 
awareness going forward. 

University in the continuum” 
and the ever-changing colors 
represents 
diversity 
amongst 

staffers.

The statue was built to honor 

past and present University staff 
for their hard work over the 
years, as well as the Bicentennial 
celebration itself. The idea of 
creating a marker honoring the 
University’s staff originated from 
the Voices of the Staff members 
— 
an 
employee 
engagement 

program consisting of University 
staff members — in 2013, who 
believe 
staff 
members 
that 

contribute 
to 
the 
University, 

should be recognized publicly 
for their dedication. Designed 
by artist Dennis Oppenheim in 
2007, the artwork was gifted by 
University alumni Jagdish and 
Saroj Janveja who donated the 
funds for the statue in recognition 
of their appreciation of the staff’s 
commitment to the University’s 
goals. 
The 
President’s 
office 

matched Janveja’s donation.

The couple previously funded 

public art placed outside of 
Michigan Stadium, the Museum of 
Natural History and the soon-to-
be-completed Biological Science 
Building, among others.

Jagdish Janveja said he felt he 

owed the University something in 
return for all that it has done for 
him, and hopes future generations 
will feel similarly.

“I’d 
like 
to 
inspire 
the 

students and staff to give back 
to the University where they are 
studying and spending their life 

at,” Janveja said. “This is a way 
of giving back. I am trying to 
encourage everybody else to help 
the university in whatever way 
you want to (enrich) the people for 
the incoming generations.” 

Laurita Thomas, associate vice 

president for human resources, 
discussed how the statute reflects 
the University’s community.

“With its many hues and 

constant prismatic changes, the 
piece is an apt reflection of our 
community, constantly changing 
and evolving, comprised of many 
colors, backgrounds and beliefs,” 
Thomas said.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel then explained why the 
University chose to dedicate a 
campus site to its employees.

“We wanted to commemorate 

the amazing work of the past, 
but also recognize that all of our 
future goals for Michigan’s third 
century and beyond rely on the 
dedication and intellect of our 
talented staff,” Schlissel said.

After the dedication, attention 

turned 
to 
various 
smaller 

presentations held under tents in 
an effort to keep out the pouring 
rain. The tents stretched from 
the Diag to the Chemistry and 
Kraus Natural Science Buildings. 
Food and drinks were provided 
to students and passersby at the 
event.

The featured tent in the center 

of the Diag held various displays 
highlighting the revolutionary new 
programs and groundbreaking 
innovations coming out of schools 
and colleges at the University, and 
were designed to be interactive in 
their format. 

Among these activities were 

presentations 
by 
the 
College 

of Pharmacy highlighting the 
college’s programs in personalized 
medicine and the Ross School of 
Business with speakers including 
Business 
Dean 
Scott 
Derue. 

Photos could also be taken with 
props sponsored by the University 
of Michigan-Dearborn campus.

Both the College of Pharmacy 

and C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital 
used virtual reality headsets. The 
College of Pharmacy utilizes VR 
technology to examine human 
lungs, among other uses, while 
C.S. Mott uses their VR headsets 
to provide an entertaining and 
positive distraction for young 
patients. Those who attended the 
exposition had the chance to try 
on both pairs of VR headsets.

Since 2015, volunteers from 

the Ann Arbor-based technology 
school GameStart have partnered 
with C.S. Mott to provide VR 
headsets 
that 
allow 
patients 

to experience roller coasters, 
submarines and other virtual 
worlds. GameStart’s work goes 
hand-in-hand with that of the 
Jim Harbaugh Foundation to help 
provide VR headsets for patients.

The 
remaining 
tents 
held 

exhibits on the value of teaching 
and education in the 21st century 
and showcased some of the 
scientific advancements from the 
College of Engineering and other 
schools and colleges.

Donahue, 
assistant 

director of program development 
at the Center for Socially Engaged 
Design, explained the importance 
of problem-scoping and social, 
economic and cultural contexts

the table,” Lawrence said. “It’s the 
women who stand up and lead.”

Saturday 
centered 
around 

headliner 
Congresswomen 

Maxine Waters, D-Calif., with 
the Sojourner Truth Luncheon. 
Waters was introduced by speaker 
Michaela Angela Davis, as the 
voice the Democratic National 
Convention ignored. Davis insists 
when women of color are in the 
room, they are bringing a plethora 
of different voices with them.

Before Waters took the stage, 

Women’s March co-chair Tamala 
Mallory 
clarified 
the 
Bernie 

Sanders controversy that clouded 
the convention a few weeks before.

“The media likes to lie,” she 

said, explaining while they are 
disappointed Sanders could not 
speak due to his choice to travel to 
Puerto Rico, Waters was always 
the main speaker for the event and 
was in fact consulted over their 
slogan, “Reclaiming our Time”.

Waters took the stage, focusing 

on rampant sexual harassment and 
assault women face in all aspects 
of the industry. She referenced 

former Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton’s book “What Happened”, 
in which Clinton described her 
discomfort of Trump’s behavior 
during the 2016 debate.

Waters said Clinton was advised 

to not speak up but she should 
have ignored that advice. No 
longer, Waters said, should women 
tolerate sexual harassment and 
should call it out when they see it: 
“Keep your hands off!” she said to 
a standing ovation.

“Every day (Trump) is in office 

is an affront to this nation,” she 
said.

Throughout the event breakout 

sessions were held on various 
topics including discussions on the 
Muslim travel ban, women in the 
media and the Flint Water Crisis— 
were “Little Miss Flint,” Mari 
Copeny herself, was a panelist. 

Michigan 
gubernatorial 

candidate Gretchen Whitmer was 
one of the speakers for the Planned 
Parenthood event. She continued 
the theme of the lack of female 
representation in the government.

“There 
were 
more 
people 

named 
‘John’ 
in 
the 
room 

than women,” Whitmer said, 
referencing that there are only two 
female Democratic governors in 

the country.

Another 
panel, 
“Say 
Her 

Name: Police Violence Against 
Women of Color is a Feminist 
Issue,” featured University of 
Michigan 
Rackham 
student 

Maryam Aziz. Aziz is one of 
the organizers for Ann Arbor 
Alliance for Black Lives, a civil 
rights group that, among many 
tasks, hopes to bring light to the 
police shooting of Ann Arbor 
resident Aura Rosser.

Aziz said Ann Arbor has 

been able to ignore its anti-
Blackness within the police 
department 
because 
of 
its 

reputation as a “neo-liberal,” 
smaller Midwestern city. She 
emphasized to the crowd that 
it did not matter whether there 
are less deaths caused by police 
in the city compared to New 
York or Cleveland— Rosser’s still 
needed attention.

Aziz also explained Ann Arbor 

mayor Chris Taylor consistently 
affirms that she was at fault for 
Rosser’s shooting and that there 
is constant overpolicing of Black 
residents on and off campus.


I

n high school, we would 
have 
all-school 
weekly 

assemblies 
(a 
little 

excessive, I know, tell me about 
it). However, there was one 
which I was always excited 
for: the Diwali assembly and 
presentation. It was vibrant, 
colorful and — my favorite part 
— it included delicious samosas. 

Diwali is the Hindu festival 

of 
lights, 
celebrated 
every 

autumn 
in 
the 
northern 

hemisphere. One of the most 
popular festivals of Hinduism, 
it spiritually represents the 
victory of light over darkness, 
good 
over 
evil, 
knowledge 

over ignorance and hope over 
despair. To celebrate Diwali 
night 
in 
mid-October/mid-

November, participants shine 
lights on housetops, outside of 
windows and doors and around 
temples and other buildings 
in the communities where the 
festival is observed.

It is often viewed as one 

of the happiest holidays. In 
preparation for the celebration, 
gifts are exchanged, decorations 
hung and seasonal specialties 
of food may be prepared. One 
popular 
dish 
often 
enjoyed 

during Diwali is the samosa. 
Served fried or baked, savory in 
flavor and triangular in shape, 
samosas 
typically 
contain 

potatoes, vegetables and meat. 
They can be compared to a mini 
chicken pot pie, for those who 
are not familiar.

Last weekend while I was 

home for fall break, my sister, 
who now attends the same high 
school as I did, was beginning 
preparation 
for 
the 
Diwali 

assembly, where she had a 
speaking role. She excitedly 
told my mother, “I don’t have 
to wear a uniform if I wear you 
know...like Indian stuff. I know 
it is short notice but maybe you 
could buy me something?”

My mom started searching 

the web muttering to herself, 
“Where do you find clothes 
like 
that?” 
I 
immediately 

interjected, “Well you don’t 
want to just buy the first 
‘Indian looking’ thing you see 
online. You don’t want to be 
culturally insensitive.” Both 
my mom and sister nodded 
in 
agreement, 
my 
sister 

ultimately deciding to wear 
her uniform plaid skirt and 
polo shirt.

I am going to pause right 

here.

Now. Rewind back to my 

comment to my mother and 
sister. “You don’t want to be 
culturally 
insensitive.” 
This 

sentence is rather short and 
sweet, not much to it, so why 
is it that more people don’t say 
this as well?

Halloween is around the 

corner, and I am certain college 
students throughout the nation 
have 
partied 
throughout 

“Hallo-weekend.” With the fun 
of this holiday, I am sure the 
ever-so-present debate about 
cultural 
appropriation 
and 

culturally insensitive costume 
themes and party ideas will 
arise yet again.

We see this almost every year 

on our campus. Sometimes, 
the debate is not even related 
to 
Halloween 
celebrations 

— such as when Delta Sigma 
Phi found themselves in hot 
water because of an Egyptian 
-themed party this summer. In 
the past another fraternity’s 
“hood ratchet” party invitation 
went viral, gaining national 
attention for its controversy. 
“Rappers, twerkers, gangsters 
(no Bloods allowed), thugs, 
basketball players, bad bitches” 
were invited. This provoked 
the birth of the Being Black at 
Michigan movement, uniting 
the Black community through 

the use of social media to 
promote activism, awareness 
and social change on campus.

These “mistakes” are not 

just limited to young people on 
college campuses, as celebrities 
often make public apologies for 
poor selections in costumes or 
commentary. Let’s not forget 
when Prince Harry wore a Nazi 
costume to a party in 2005 or 
when Katy Perry dressed as a 
geisha during a 2013 MTV Video 
Music 
Awards 
performance. 

Even more recently, Kendall 
Jenner 
starred 
in 
a 
Pepsi 

advertisement which seemingly 
degraded the Black Lives Matter 
movement. This prompts me to 
ask my question again: How 
is it that more people cannot 
ask or at least acknowledge 
the question, “Could this be 
culturally insensitive?”

In 
high 
school, 
I 
loved 

the Diwali assembly not just 
because I was able to eat 
samosas and get out of class. I 
was able to learn and immerse 
myself in a different culture. 
Not to use it as a trend or a joke, 
a costume or party idea, but to 
understand and educate myself 
on the various different cultures 
and backgrounds my peers at 
school came from.

Halloween is fun. I do not 

mean for this piece to diminish 
that. I love seeing all the 
different 
creative 
costumes, 

and I am a huge fan of themed 
parties. However, it is also 
important to remember that 
someone’s heritage, the color of 
their skin, their religion or their 
culture are NOT costumes. They 
are NOT party ideas. Because 
after Oct. 31, when you take 
the costume off, the person you 
stole it from will carry on living 
as they do. 

O

ctober is one of my 
favorite 
months 
of 

the year. It’s home to 

beautiful fall days, 
visits to the cider 
mill, corn mazes and 
pumpkin 
patches. 

But above all, it’s 
home to Halloween. 
This is the one time 
we can put fake 
corpses and bones 
on the lawn without 
seeming creepy or 
hand candy out to 
children 
without 

getting the cops called. 

As much as I love Halloween 

and its spooky aura, there 
is one ritual that I’ll never 
understand — horror movies. 
Just having fled my apartment 
after my roommate insisted on 
watching “The Ring,” I think 
that now is an appropriate 
time to ask: Why do people 
watch them? Why does one 
feel the need to suffer such 
mental torture?

First, let me establish that 

when I say “horror movies,” 
I’m not referring to those in 
which the protagonist trips 
over a pebble, takes 34 seconds 
to recover and then gets killed 
by a guy with a chainsaw after 
hiding in a conveniently-placed 
slaughterhouse. Similar to a 
haunted house or maze, while 
these types of horror movies may 
have a few jump-scares, there’s 
always a sense of comedic relief 
due to their unrealism.

For this reason I can tolerate 

scary Halloween decorations, 
haunted 
mazes, 
haunted 

houses and the like, as they 
all have a similar underlying 
fakeness. After visiting one 
of these attractions, I have no 
trouble falling asleep because 
I’m pretty sure the guy dressed 
up in the mediocre headless 
horseman 
costume 
didn’t 

follow me home on his donkey.

But the horror movies I’m 

referring to are different. I’m 
referring to horror movies 
that are scary on a much 
deeper 
psychological 
level 

— the movies that induce an 
inability to sleep and cause 
emotional scarring. I know 
that everyone is different — for 
example, maybe tripping on a 
pebble really gets some people 
going — but for me, the scariest 

movies are based on true 
stories or contain some type of 
paranormal phenomena. These 

movies 
penetrate 

deeper 
and 
their 

effects on the mind 
linger. I cannot leave 
that behind at some 
farm in Ypsilanti.

The 
few 
times 

that 
I’ve 
actually 

watched 
one 
of 

these movies, I’ve 
experienced terror in 
two phases. The first 
phase 
takes 
place 

during the movie when my 
heart rate is consistently above 
150 beats per minute, and the 
question “Why am I doing 
this 
to 
myself?” 
ricochets 

through my mind. The second 
phase takes place immediately 
after the movie and may last 
hours, days, months, years or 
a lifetime — who knows. This 
when I rediscover my fear of 
the darkness and accept that 
monsters are, in fact, real. Let 
me give a few examples.

Before watching the “The 

Blair Witch Project:”

“Oh, 
look 
at 
that 
odd 

formation of sticks and leaves 
in the shape of a human,” 
I think while hiking in the 
woods. “How cool! Nature is 
marvelous.”

After watching “The Blair 

Witch Project:”

“Hey 
Evan, 
wanna 
go 

hiking?”

“No.”
Before I accidentally glimpse 

the “Paranormal Activity” trailer:

“I slept so well last night.”
After I accidentally glimpse the 

“Paranormal Activity” trailer:

“Ghosts don’t exist,” I think 

as I get into bed with the lights 
still on. “But then again, no 
one knows for sure that ghosts 

don’t exist. Wait, did it just 
get colder in here? OK, even if 
ghosts do exist, why would it 
want to kill me of all people — 
and why tonight of all nights? 
It’s had 20 years to do the deed. 
Just go to sleep.” As I hesitantly 
shut my eyes, I hear a creak in 
the hallway and accept death.

With the level of distress 

that horror movies cause me, 
I find it absolutely fascinating 
that there are people who like 
them. After a thorough Google 
search, I’ve found that it baffles 
psychologists as well. Though 
there are many theories as to 
why certain people are drawn 
to 
this 
voluntary 
mental 

suffering, no one knows the 
exact reason.

One theory is that people 

enjoy 
the 
thrill 
and 
are 

genetically 
wired 
to 
seek 

out scary images. We have a 
primitive instinct that helps us 
identify threats to keep us alive, 
and when we identify these 
threats, we experience a rush of 
adrenaline and dopamine. As a 
result, after watching a horror 
movie people forget they were 
scared but remember having a 
good time. Therefore, they keep 
watching them to re-experience 
these 
heightened 
states 
of 

arousal. Others, however, may be 
overstimulated by these feelings 
and have a negative experience.

Another theory puts a rather 

philosophical and ironic twist 
on the enjoyment found through 
horror movies. It claims horror 
movies offer an escape from 
the terrors of the real world 
by introducing people to new 
ones. The difference between 
movies and life, however, is 
that movies usually have happy 
resolutions. 
This 
provides 

a newfound belief in justice 
when going back to reality. 

So during times of stress — 

like right now during midterm 
season — maybe watching a 
horror movie isn’t the craziest 
of ideas. After all, there’s not 
much 
scarier 
than 
exams. 

And according to research, 
watching an exorcism may be 
of great relief to certain types 
of people, but I’m not that type 
of person. I think I’ll stick to 
The Bachelor.

Making academia accessible

ELLERY ROSENZWEIG | COLUMN

T

he 
clock 
strikes 
10 

after, and class begins. 
Only three slides into 

the lecture on the greenhouse 
effect, I’m already confused. I 
understand these greenhouse 
gases affect our planet, but 
when the professor begins to 
explain the specific ways this 
occurs, the language he uses 
leaves me lost. All of his lectures 
have left me in this state of 
confusion, and it has to do 
with the fact that my professor 
assumes we understand all 
these “basic” terms that relate 
to climate change, so he uses 
them to explain even more 
complex 
concepts 
without 

defining them first.

While not trying to be rude, 

I pull out my phone to Google 
the terms on the slide. The 
definitions I find are filled 
with scientific jargon that lead 
me to search more definitions. 
Before I know it, my professor 
is on the next new concept. So, 
I take a breath and decide to 
scribble question marks next 
to the terms I don’t know and 
the concepts I still don’t fully 
understand in order to try to 
focus on his next point.

As a social science student, 

I signed up for this lower-
level course discussing climate 
change, thinking I would finally 
gain a small understanding of 
this extremely complex issue. 
However, I finished the course 
more confused than when I 
started. Instead of trying to 
understand the concepts in this 
issue, I found myself spending 
all my time just trying to learn 
and memorize the scientific 
jargon surrounding the topic.

In the context of climate 

change, which scientists are 
constantly 
trying 
to 
prove 

is 
important, 
shouldn’t 
the 

language around it be accessible 
to the masses? Even as someone 
who has spent time studying in 
an academic setting, I still find 
this language incredibly complex 
and confusing. How is the public 
supposed to vote on critical 
issues regarding this information 
if we don’t understand these 
basic concepts?

This doesn’t just happen in 

academia relating to natural 
sciences, but also in several 
other subjects. I find myself 
reading through journals in my 
social science and humanities 
courses where they assume 
the audience knows the jargon 
they use. As a student at one 
of the top public universities 
in the country, I still do not 
always understand the language 
surrounding information that 
I am expected to read in my 
courses. And if getting an 
undergraduate degree means I 
am an academic, then who is the 
target audience for articles and 
journals such as the ones I read 
in my classes? I would argue 
they are for the academic or 
intellectual elite.

This extremely small group 

of intellectuals is an exclusive 
club who create information 
and studies for one another. 
They have the ability to generate 
terms to describe concepts to 
one another and exclude those 
who do not have access to their 
journals 
and 
research. 
And 

this assumption that everyone 
has knowledge of the specific 
terminology in a particular field 
is elitist, especially when the 
only trusted studies of empirical 
research 
and 
peer-reviewed 

journals are produced using 
complex language full of jargon 
that is not accessible to everyone. 
This means that information 
is only reaching those with the 
resources and the ability to read 
and understand. So even if the 
average person wanted to be an 
informed citizen of our world 
and planet and try to understand 
these complex issues, they face 
many obstacles.

Furthermore, 
the 
ability 

to access these resources via 
journals or in classrooms is 
expensive. Being a student at a 
research institution will grant 
you this access, but the price 
of university alone excludes 
many people from a lower 
socioeconomic background from 
attaining this education. And 
for those who have graduated 
and want to stay informed, 
signing up for a subscription to 

these journals can cost a lot of 
money. For example, “Nature,” 
a scientific journal known for 
its credibility, has an annual 
subscription of $69.

I’m not the only one who 

has thought about creating 
accessible 
language 
in 

academia. It is a controversial 
issue 
that 
academics 
have 

been 
discussing 
for 
years. 

According to Patti Lather, an 
educational instructor at Ohio 
State University in feminist 
theory, language should be 
accessible to everyone. But 
the academics writing in this 
field have been known to 
push back against this notion, 
which shows how academics 
are 
continuing 
to 
make 

information inaccessible, even 
though they have a message 
that highlights social change.

If you don’t have access, 

you may go searching on the 
Internet, 
where 
there 
are 

several 
sources, 
but 
they 

are not always reviewed or 
trusted. Ultimately, this leaves 
a majority of our population 
without credible information. 
Information 
should 
be 

accessible to everyone and at 
level that is comprehensible to 
the average person.

I’m 
suggesting 
that 
we 

as 
academics, 
students, 

professors 
and 
researchers 

take a look at the language in 
our studies and journals. We 
should make the extra effort 
to use language that is not 
confusing with the intention 
to spread our information to 
everyone. The research we 
collect and the writings we 
produce should not just be for 
the academic elite.

As 
a 
university 
that 

prioritizes 
inclusivity 
and 

equity, this is a space where 
we can set an example for 
the 
academic 
communities 

around us — where we can 
make credible, trusted and 
comprehensible 
information 

accessible for all people who 
want to be informed.

‘So B. It’ is now playing at The Michigan Theater

FILM REVIEW

“So B. It” follows the cross-
country journey of Heidi It (Talitha 
Bateman, “Annabelle: Creation”) 
from Reno, Nevada to Liberty, 
New York as she searches for her 
origins. What could have been an 
autumn feel-good movie instead 
holds desperately to the narrative 
voice in the children’s book by 
Sarah Weeks, an Ann Arbor native. 
As a result, “So B. It” is riddled with 
awkward voice-overs (sometimes 
interjected into the middle of 
conversations) 
and 
artificial 
dialogue. The cast only emphasizes 
the stiffness of the script through 
monotone deliveries or, on the other 
end of the spectrum, out of place, 
ear-splitting and melodramatic 
screaming.
Heidi lives in an apartment 
with her special needs mother, So 
B. It (Jessie Collins, “Revolution”), 
and their former neighbor, Bernie 
(Alfre Woodard, “12 Years a 
Slave”). 
Suddenly 
spurred 
to 
discover her past when her mother 
conspicuously adds a new word to 
her extremely limited vocabulary, 
Heidi digs up old photos and 
follows the clues to a special 
living community, called Hilltop 
Home, in New York. Before she 
runs away, though, she throws a 
series of temper tantrums that feel 
unaligned with Heidi’s supposed 
selflessness and kindness. In fact, 
many of the characters Heidi 

meets on her trip to New York are 
contradictory, like the bus driver 
who first eyes her with suspicion, 
then inexplicably vouches for her, 
or the owner of Hilltop Home, 
Thurman 
Hill 
(John 
Heard, 
“Home Alone”).
When 
Heidi 
first 
meets 
Thurman Hill, he is belligerent and 
threatening, eventually ordering 
her to leave. A week later, after it is 
revealed they are related, he offers 
to be a real grandfather to her. 
This complete 180 in personality 
is not the only aspect of the film 

that is questionable. The film 
attempts to defend its improbable 
plot as a result of Heidi’s supposed 
good luck. Somehow, viewers are 
expected to believe a 12-year-old 
with some lipstick could sneak 
into a Las Vegas casino, play a slot 
machine and win enough quarters 
to travel nearly 3,000 miles. Or 
that, like voodoo magic, Heidi can 
whisper at a jar and guess the exact 
number of jellybeans in it. Or, as the 
film opens, her correctly predicting 
10 coin flips in a row is a good 
reason for a cop to take her back to 
his home and attempt to adopt her. 
Besides being ridiculous, Heidi’s 
good luck has no other relation 
to the story or her character 

development, only existing as an 
excuse for an absurd plot.
“So B. It” fails most in its 
attempt to be inclusive and tug 
at heartstrings with its depiction 
of 
mental 
illnesses. 
Heidi’s 
mother functions almost like a 
prop throughout the film with a 
shallow background, no role other 
than to utter a word that sends 
her daughter on a bratty tailspin 
and a cringeworthy, unnuanced 
performance by Collins. Similarly, 
Woodard’s performance delivers 
an 
over-the-top 
depiction 
of 
agoraphobia. In a scene where 
Bernie struggles to overcome 
her fear that is meant to induce 
tears, Woodard jerks around like a 
woman possessed in a completely 
inaccurate 
and 
ultimately 
insensitive 
interpretation. 
Contrastly in films like “Silver 
Linings Playbook (2012)” and 
“Black Swan (2010),” mental illness 
served less as a tearjerker and 
instead as a complex, multi-faceted 
part of the character’s personality. 
Natalie Portman (“Jackie”), Bradley 
Cooper (“American Sniper”) and 
Jennifer Lawrence (“Joy”) — the 
lead actors in the aforementioned 
films — clearly put in the effort to 
understand the psyche of those 
with disorders outside of their 
physical manifestations. “So B. 
It” may have been based on a 
successful children’s book, but 
the film forgets to retain the very 
nature of stories about children 
that make them so moving — hope, 
fun and authenticity.

‘So B. It’ lacks whimsy

Film fails to inspire with its poor display of mental illness

BOOK REVIEW
‘Voices’ & moral grayness

Ulli Lust’s graphic novel explores disturbing nature of war

Based on Marcel Beyer’s “The 
Karnau Tapes” (1997), “Voices 
in the Dark” is Ulli Lust’s first 
fictional graphic novel and an 
ambitious undertaking. The novel’s 
protagonist, Hermann Karnau, 
is an audio engineer/scientist in 
his late twenties who is hired by 
the Nazi Party to work on strange 
projects during World War II. 
“Voices in the Dark” draws the 
reader into the niche world of sound 
recording and editing. Karnau’s 
interest in the essence of sound 
borders on obsession, driving him 
not just onto shaky moral ground, 
but far beyond it. Lust’s translation 
of Beyer’s story into graphic form 
is well paced, and her deliberately 
imprecise, 
gothic 
illustrations 
complement the emotional quality 
of the story. Her rendering of 
Beyer’s narrative stands on its own, 
a nuanced exploration of humanity 
that challenges our understanding 
of both ourselves and how and with 
whom we empathize.
Part of the novel’s strength 
comes from the ambiguity of 
Lust’s storytelling. Told primarily 
from Karnau’s standpoint, the 
novel shifts abruptly between his 
perspective and the perspective of 
Helga Goebbels, one of five siblings 
and the daughter of a high-ranking 
official of the Third Reich. The 
stories begin separately but become 
intertwined when the children run 
into Karnau’s dog, Coco. From this 
starting point of pure innocence, 
the novel progresses by degrees 
into an atmosphere of what can 
only be recognized as evil, before 
leaving its reader with a conclusion 
that is morally challenging in more 
ways than one. It does so in such 
a way, though, that the reader 
hardly notices if they aren’t paying 
attention.

The 
feeling 
of 
watching 
Karnau’s involvement in the Nazi 
government’s sinister “research” 
is one of disbelief. After much 
of the events of the novel have 
transpired, it is revealed that 
Karnau’s narratives are told from 
his perspective in the “present” — 
1992 — after the discovery of audio 
recordings from the Führer’s final 
days in a bunker where they and 
many others spent the final days of 
the war. This revelation opens up 
space for a re-reading of Karnau’s 
recounts as a collective exploration 
of cognitive dissonance at its peak.
The 
novel’s 
first 
half 
is 
punctuated 
with 
profoundly 
disturbing images, but images 

accompanied by relatively benign 
or, at the very least, detached 
descriptions. At one point, Karnau 
gives a scientific description of 
a 
particular 
procedure: 
“The 
jaws are clamped apart to avoid 
damaging the enamel … several 
microphones are needed … One 
is secreted in the immediate 
vicinity of the sound source to 
pick up special frequencies.” Then 
we learn that he is preparing a 
human subject for torture through 
intense shocking. Other instances 
similarly juxtapose commentary 
that seems coldly out of touch 
with the images with which it 
is presented. One disturbingly 
memorable 
scene 
involves 
opening a subject’s throat in 
order to remove his entire tongue 
— without anesthetic. Thanks 
to Lust’s presentation, moments 

like 
these 
feel 
appropriately 
uncomfortable. 
Together, 
they 
provide a challenging look at how 
Karnau has, over time, distanced 
himself from the reprehensible 
eugenics-related “studies” that he 
himself orchestrated.
After 
challenging 
us, 
the 
narrative 
continues 
beyond 
Karnau’s recollections and enters 
territory that broadly questions 
empathy as he listens once again 
to the recordings he saved for 
himself. Throughout “Voices in 
the Dark,” we are drawn closer 
and closer to the five Goebbels 
children. Though they live with 
immense privilege, belonging to 
a family deeply implicated in the 
most thoroughly evil movement of 
the 20th century, they themselves 
are innocent. They poke fun at 
Karnau for having named his 
dog “Coco” — the youngest of the 
five breaks out in tears when her 
favorite stuffed animal is forgotten 
at the family’s estate when they 
move to a bunker in anticipation 
of air raids; once there, they find 
themselves missing the amenities 
of their previous lives: Chocolate 
and sugar and pastries.
While the children remain 
pitifully unaware of the grave 
nature of their situation, the reader 
knows too much, and watches 
the eldest of the siblings realize 
their fate. The mechanism that 
brings them to their fate, though, 
presents the emotional climax 
of the novel. Certain details are 
never clarified and, like Karnau’s 
war crimes, neither blame nor 
guilt assigned. Little is left truly 
resolved, but it seems a resolution 
would just undo all of the beautiful 
tension that builds up throughout. 
A true resolution would destroy the 
atmosphere of ambiguity so crucial 
throughout. Even the final pages 
of “Voices in the Dark” are doused 
in chilling mystery, as the titular 
voices, one by one, fall silent.

Yes, I too am utterly repelled by the premise of this show.
‘Drop the Mic’ is fun, but 
not necessary to watch
TBS’s latest promotional stunt is ultimately uninspiring

Hear me out — I love amateur live 
performance as much as the next 
guy. There’s something about going 
to a bar, open mic, party or drag 
show and listening to burgeoning 
(or dwindling) talent and having 
a good evening. Maybe you talk to 
the performer afterward and find 
out they’re a cool person. Maybe 
you come back home afterwards 
and decide to become a groupie. 
Maybe you watch their rise to fame 
and say, “Hey, I knew about them 
before everyone else did.” I’m all 
about that.
There’s an issue, however, when 
the performer is already famous. 
James Corden’s “Drop the Mic,” 
which premiered Tuesday, Oct. 24 
on TBS, is a corny little segment 
where two celebrities of varying 
relevance duke it out in a rap battle. 
Corden, who has a very specific 
affinity for musical competition, 
has taken already taken a similar 
series (“Carpool Karaoke”) to 

Apple Music in 2016. Like “Carpool 
Karaoke,” “Drop the Mic” started 
as a segment on “The Late Late 
Show,” 
but 
after 
increasing 
popularity 
and 
demand 
from 
celebrities for the opportunity to 
rap battle, the series has become its 
own being.
Corden himself does not host 
the series, although he does appear 

in the first episode. In an effort 
to cast a broader net to attract 
viewers, the series has recruited 
Hailey Baldwin (“Love Advent”) 
and a haggard-sounding Method 
Man aka Clifford Smith (“The 
Deuce”) to anchor. The pair of 
second-generation 
Hollywood-
family ingenue with a short resume 
and Wu-Tang Clan member-gone-
actor is as confusing to me as it is 

to you. However, both Baldwin 
and Smith carry their weight and 
hype up the audience of “Drop 
the Mic.” Baldwin is fresh and 
enthusiastic and Smith is engaging 
and in-control. I can’t be mad at 
professionalism.
The show itself is broken into 
two separate battles. Each celebrity 
gets 
three 
opportunities 
to 
disrespect their opponent through 
the brutal power of spoken word, 
before Smith reigns everyone 
back in to decide the winner. 
Victory is synonymous with the 
magnitude of applause, but Smith 
himself has the final say on who 
is the real winner. Before the 
battle can really begin, however, 
the program switches gears from 
the high-energy set to a promo 
reel, essentially, which highlights 
the career of the participants. 
It’s a huge break in tone from the 
program and reminds the audience 
that the series stems from a talk 
show, where celebrities come to 
promote their new projects.

A Halloween Poetry 
Playlist for the spooky soul

Poems meant to spook and scare before the holiday is upon us

It’s that time of year again — by 
which I mean the absolute best 
time!
October is almost over and 
Halloween is officially upon us. 
We’ve had some truly beautiful 
autumn days, and the weather is 
starting to get chillier. “Stranger 
Things” season two is out, along 
with fresh scary movies like “It” 
and “Happy Death Day.” Pumpkins 
have been carved, and theories 
about 
potential 
Halloween 
costumes are finally coming to 
fruition.
But if you’re looking to really 
round out the season, there may 
be one more thing left to check off 
the Halloween bucket list: reading 
some high-quality spooky poetry.
Spooky poetry is fun anytime, 
anywhere, but Halloween offers 
many advantages if you want to 
get really extra about it. You can 
recite the scary lines around a 
hearth with your friends, or flip 
through them during an afternoon 
excursion to the cemetery. I know 
what you’re thinking: Where am I 
going to find good scary poetry at 
such late notice? Don’t be afraid! 
(See what I did there?) Here is a list 
of some of the creepiest verse out 
there to get you started.
“The Homemade Mermaid,” by 
Matthea Harvey
This poem starts out interesting 
and becomes downright terrifying, 
using mermaids and homemade 
science as a way of exploring 
gender dynamics. Horror can be 
a great way of digging into social 
issues, and Harvey does this 
brilliantly, especially in her live 
reading of the poem. She has other 
mermaid poems, too, like “The 
Backyard Mermaid” and “The 
Objectified Mermaid.”
“Ghost Q & A,” by Anne Carson

“Ghost Q & A” is deceptively 
simple, but also inventive, taking 
the form of a conversation between 
a ghost (A) and an unnamed 
questioner (Q). The ghost is 
surprisingly straightforward and 
even kind of sassy, but not in an 
over-the-top way. And the poem 
invites so many questions that 
it’s almost impossible not to read 
it more than one time. (Who is 
talking to the ghost? And who is 
the man who does the zeroes?) 
Note: It’s worth checking Carson 
out beyond this poem, because 
she’s done some really terrific work 

in the past with poetry, fiction, 
nonfiction, translation — pretty 
much everything.
“Scary 
Movies,” 
by 
Kim 
Addonizio
We all know the feeling of lying 
in bed after watching a scary 
movie, not wanting to move out 
of the fear that a monster might 
be lurking underneath. Addonizio 
captures this sense of terror and 
more in “Scary Movies.”
“Song,” by Brigit Pegeen Kelly
Probably my personal favorite 
on this list, this prose poem is 
effective in so many different 
ways. There’s horrifying imagery 
(a goat’s head is hanging in a tree 
in the first line), but even that 
doesn’t cut nearly as deep as the 

horrors of death, sin and stolen 
innocence that eventually emerge 
from the lines. What’s more, Kelly 
reaches deep into these layers 
to explore thoughts about the 
meaninglessness of tragedy and 
the beauty of life itself.
“Schizophrenia,” by Jim Stevens
This is a haunted house poem 
told from the perspective of the 
haunted house, in which the 
building becomes its own presence 
and the rooms become almost like 
characters. It’s full of eerie, visual 
imagery, and the relative absence 
of humans makes it all the more 
interesting.
“The Session,” by Jeanann 
Verlee
This poem doesn’t contain any 
witches or ghosts or Halloween 
imagery; the horror is a lot deeper 
and more psychological. It’s also 
very sad. I will admit, I wasn’t 
entirely sure whether or not I 
understood it at first, but this live 
reading was pretty emotional and 
left me with a stronger sense of 
what it was about.
“Ghost 
Dance,” 
by 
Sara 
Littlecrow-Russell
This is another one that, while 
definitely not about Halloween, is 
hard not to include here because 
it’s just so haunting. There’s also an 
undercurrent of hope toward the 
very end, which is both refreshing 
in the context of this list and very 
powerful within the poem itself.
“my eyes in the time of 
apparition,” by Rachel McKibbens
Rachel McKibbens uses a lot 
of surprising and sometimes even 
grotesque imagery in her work, 
but always to deeply emotional and 
significant ends. This poem is a 
good example of that, using sirens 
and witches as a way of exploring 
anger, grief and personal agency.

Best of the Fest: Daily Arts 
takes Austin City Limits
Daily Arts recount the wins and woes of the Austin festival

Earlier this month, three Daily 
Arts Editors went on an odyssey 
to Austin, Texas to attend Austin 
City Limits, a three-day festival of 
music, art and — most importantly 
— breakfast tacos. 
Solange
Solange is an artist you must see 
live. All the elements that make 
her such an important recording 
artist are amplified on stage. Her 
precision, her joy, her presence — 
it’s breathtaking. The visuals, in 
all their color coordination and 
choreography, enhance Solange’s 
sound without overpowering it.
After some travel delays, Solange 
and her band took the stage, awash 
in orange light. Every aspect of the 
show was quietly and soulfully 
choreographed; from the sways of 
her singers to the grooves of the 
musicians, each in some variation 
of an all orange outfit. But it didn’t 
feel forced. Each motion, no matter 
how small or grand, was meant.
Pulling mainly from A Seat at the 
Table, Solange moved seamlessly 
between tracks. She delivered 
the more pointed moments of her 
music with grace; striking a balance 
between giving the content the 
respect it deserves without making 
the performance too heavy. The 
importance of Solange’s art was 
palpable in the crowd; the faces of 
those along the guard rails were 
nothing if not exuberant. But even 
those in the furthest reaches of the 
crowd, those just barely touched by 
her warm light, felt Solange’s quiet 
power, too.

Vulfpeck
Jack Stratton guided the crowd 
in breathing exercises, six beautiful 
boys sang an a cappella to “Back 
Pocket,” Antwaun Stanley, Joey 
Dosik and Theo Katzman crowded 
around a keyboard and harmonize 
to “Birds of a Feather, We Rock 
Together,” and Stratton finished 
it all off with a handstand in the 
center of Honda Stage.
All of these things, these images 
were faroff myths to me before 
Friday, October 13th. I’ve been 
listening to Vulfpeck ever since 
my sister played “Back Pocket” 
for me back in 2013 and despite 
going to their alma mater, I always 
managed to miss my chance at 
seeing them live. But somehow, 
that chance came to me in Austin, 
Texas, hundreds of miles from 
where the group formed. And it 
was so, unbelievably worth it just 
to see “Beastly” live.
Opening 
with 
the 
clipped 
chords 
of 
Cory 
Wong 
and 
Stratton’s guitars on “Cory Wong” 
Vulfpeck took the stage after their 
pre-recorded introduction in the 
style of Don Pardo. Stratton yelled 
something about taking it “down 
south the coast of California” and 
my heart stopped as the first notes 
of “El Chepe”’s piano progression 
began. 
Antwaun 
brought 
the 
“Funky Duck,” “Aunt Leslie,” and 
“1612,” and Dart, of course, brought 
the bass. I wish there were more 
words to describe the experience 
of watching “Beastly” and “Dean 
Town” performed live, hearing 
the small fraction of the crowd 

who were down with the music 
singing along to the bass notes 
and chord changes as if they were 
words, lyrics, stories. I was worried 
the set would be identical to the 
week before’s; I shouldn’t have 
underestimated them like that. 
Because even after performing the 
previous Friday and two shows at 
Emo’s in Austin, the boys were still 
their magnetic, charming selves.
— Natalie Zak
Whitney
I saw Whitney frontmen (and 
certified cute boys) Max Kakacek 
and Julien Ehrlich play ACL back 
in 2013 and 2011, while they were 
playing with Smith Westerns. I 
was in high school and their music 
made me feel impossibly cool.
Now that they’re playing as 
Whitney, they make me feel — like 
all good bands do — very cool and 
very, very uncool. But, I didn’t fall 
in love with Whitney until I saw 
them live for the first time at a small 
show in Burlington, Vermont. 
They’re smooth and magnetic and 
crushingly cool. They’re the kind of 
band that is elevated by their own 
persona. It’s not a persona, though, 
that’s acted. Their charm and 
energy and sheer talent make them 
one of the best live acts currently 
on tour.
During their set last weekend, 
they played all the way through 
their debut album Light Upon 
the Lake, which, Ehrlich jokingly 
reminded the crowd only clocks 
in at 30 minutes. Opening with 
“Dave’s Song,” which holds a high 
ranking on my list of “Song that 
Make Me Want to Dance and Cry 
(at the same time),” the band drifted 
from song to song. The extra-
album side of their set was filled out 
with Dolly Parton and Bob Dylan 
covers, and Ehrlich punctuated his 
airy falsetto with intimate banter. 
He met his girlfriend’s parents last 
week, they loved him (of course), 
and that morning he was really, 
really hungover.
Whitney sounds like summer, 
but they also sound like fall and 
spring and best parts of winter. 
They make sparkling nighttime 
driving songs and dreamy lay-on-
your-bed-and-stare-at-the-ceiling 
song and (thankfully) swelling, 
dizzying, dancing in the sun songs. 
And, actually, all of those things 
apply to all of their songs.
— Madeleine Gaudin
Angel Olsen
Anything I write about Angel 
Olsen should be called “Why 
I Am Not A Singer.” Watching 
Olsen perform proves something 
I’ve long suspected: I’ll never 
understand everything that goes 
into musical performance. And I 
think that’s why I enjoy it so much.
Olsen was bubbly and electric, 
increasingly excited by the crowd 
and the night and how much she 
loves doing what she does, how 
much she loves doing the thing that 
blows my mind. And that thing 
is really just singing. She and her 
music are all about her voice and it’s 
airy ineffable quality. Olsen swayed 
through tracks from her first three 
studio albums and played “Special” 
the most recent single from her 
forthcoming collection Phases.
As the sun set and Austin 
started to (finally) cool to a brisk 
85, Olsen broke into the opening 

notes of MY WOMAN standout 
and certified bop “Shut Up Kiss 
Me.” The way she smiles when 
she sings, the sharp twinkle of her 
voice, the electric current that runs 
between Olsen and the crowd, each 
one requiring the other to live: This 
is why people go to shows.
— Madeleine Gaudin
Red Hot Chili Peppers 
At this point in their career, the 
Red Hot Chili Peppers have live 
performance down to a science; 
they know exactly what a crowd 
(especially an enormous festival 
crowd) wants to hear. Anthony 
Kiedis and Flea sprinkle in just 
enough banter to be charming, 
the band rocks just hard enough to 
warrant woos and shoves from the 
masses. And, despite playing what 
is expected, their weekend two set 
still proved entertaining.
On top of the hits — “Snow 
((Hey Oh)),” “Californication,” “By 
the Way,” “Give it Away,” etc. — 
the Peppers threw in some deep 
cuts and covers to round out their 
setlist. Stevie Wonder’s “Higher 
Ground” and Tom Petty’s “A Face 
in the Crowd” were among the 
covers.
But the most notable had to be 
The Stooges’ “I Wanna Be Your 
Dog.” There was a pause over the 
crowd as tried to decipher the 
opening notes, but once those 
iconic sleigh bells hit, it clicked. 
I could tell that not everyone 
recognized the track, but for me, 
a punk-centric youth from Ann 
Arbor, this homage to proto-punk 
made the set. Even after the last 
notes of “Give It Away” faded out 
and a shirtless Kiedis bid us all a 
goodnight, all I could hear were 
those opening lines, “So wrapped 
up / I want you here….”
— Carly Snider
BadBadNotGood
Have you ever gotten down to 
a jazz quartet? Like literally down 
on the ground as the band shouts 
at you to get low with everyone 
else in the crowd? In the final 
moments of their set, this is exactly 
what BadBadNotGood had their 
crowd do, and the intimacy of the 
small crowd tucked under Tito’s 
Handmade Vodka tent made the 
experience all that more incredible. 
Because while the music the group 
plays may be strictly called jazz, 
their foundations were originally 
geared toward reworking songs 
by the likes of Nas, Odd Future, 
and A Tribe Called Quest. And 
this becomes entirely clear when 
surrounded by a sea of 18 year old 
boys in cuffed jeans and oxfords 
throwing their hands and jumping 
in sync to the instrumental 
“Hedron.”
BadBadNotGood has it, that 
thing that makes crowds fall in 
love with you. It’s in their music, 
in their extreme command over 
their instruments, their youth and 
vibrancy that brings so much life 
to their performance. In the small 
tent in front of Tito’s stage for the 
hour that the quartet played, that 
entire crowd was cut off from the 
outside world and caught up in 
Leland Whitty’s sax.

Finally champions

 With a 2-1 double overtime 
victory over Maryland, the 

Michigan men’s soccer team 
clinched its first conference 

title in program history.

 » SportsMonday Column, 

Page 2B

Real deal?
The Michigan hockey team 
split its series with No. 15 
Penn State, making the case 
that the Wolverines can 
legitimately compete in the 
Big Ten this season.
» Page 4B

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

pulled Brandon Peters in close 
and gave the 20-year-old a few 
final words of advice. Peters had 
worked on everything his coach 
had told him to. He needed to 
be louder, communicate better 
and have bigger presence on the 
field. When Harbaugh let him 
go, Peters jogged 15 yards out, 
shuffled his feet and sprinted 
right back — one last warm up.

After a season and a half of 

waiting, he was finally going in 
for a legitimate drive. Peters, the 
quarterback Michigan fans have 
called for since the Spring Game, 
took 
over 
the reigns. 
The 

fans at Michigan 
Stadium 

cheered at the 
sight 

of No. 18 lining 
up 

under center.

With 

him 
in 

command, 
the 
Wolverines 

marched 
downfield 
for 
a 

touchdown, and on their next two 
drives, they reached the end zone 
as well. The offense surged, the 
passing game connected and the 
Wolverines defeated Rutgers in a 
comfortable 35-14 win.

Peters’ performance — 124 

passing yards, a 71 percent 
completion 
rate 
and 
one 

touchdown — garnered praise 
from his teammates, coaches and 
the entire crowd.

With less than a minute 

remaining in the second quarter, 
Peters dropped a lofted pass 
to 
sophomore 
running 
back 

Chris Evans for his first career 
touchdown pass. Streaking for 
the end zone, Evans made the 
catch and fell across the goal line 
for the 20-yard score.

“Ever since (redshirt junior 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight) 

went down, I stepped into the 

backup role, and ever since then 
I’ve been preparing like I’m the 
starting QB,” Peters said.

All the preparation finally 

became worthwhile. Michigan 
(3-2 Big Ten, 6-2 overall) made the 
switch to Peters on its fifth drive 
of the game, after fifth-year senior 
John O’Korn was intercepted and 
threw for just 13 yards.

The mood at Michigan Stadium 

changed immediately, and so did 
the Wolverines’ game plan.

When O’Korn was in, the 

coaches’ 
conservative 
play 

calling leaned on the 
running backs. 
Michigan 
would give 
the 
ball 

to junior 
Karan 

Higdon, fifth-year senior Ty Isaac 
or redshirt freshman Kareem 
Walker. Rarely did O’Korn get the 
green light to pass downfield.

When O’Korn finally received 

that signal midway through the 
first quarter, he was picked off.

So 
Peters 
entered, 
and 

Michigan balanced its offense. 
On his first drive, the Wolverines 
ran five times, passed three 
and capped it off with a 10-yard 
rushing touchdown from Higdon.

Though Peters passed more 

consistently than O’Korn, the 

running backs still made major 

contributions 
Saturday 

against 
the 
Scarlet 

Knights.

Higdon 
led 
the 

team with 158 rushing 

yards 
and 
two 

touchdowns, 

Isaac 

ran for over 100 yards and Walker 
had a career-high six rushing 
attempts to go along with his first 
touchdown at Michigan.

Rutgers found its own success 

on the ground, as both of the 
Scarlet 
Knights’ 
touchdowns 

came on run plays. The first — a 
direct snap to receiver Janarion 
Grant — came midway through 
the second quarter, when Grant 
sped past Michigan’s secondary 
for a 65-yard rush. Running back 
Gus Edwards scored the second 
touchdown on a two-yard rush in 
the third quarter.

Michigan’s defense allowed 

a total of just 195 yards, keeping 
Rutgers (2-3, 3-5) contained for 
the majority of the game. Fifth-
year senior defensive lineman 
Maurice Hurst led the unit with 
eight tackles, two tackles for loss 
and one sack on Rutgers’ first play 
of the game.

“It felt huge to get that first 

sack on the first play,” Hurst 
said. “I think it really did get our 
defense going. Anytime you can 
three-and-out them early on in 
the game is really important.”

The defense played as expected 

and so did the running backs, but 
when O’Korn had another hiccup, 
Harbaugh knew that the time had 
come. He made the choice to put 
Peters in, and the move paid off.

He led the team on 50, 60 and 

70-yard scoring drives. He played 
a pivotal role in each of them, 
leading Michigan to a much-
needed win. And more than that, 
Saturday was the inception of the 
Peters-era in Ann Arbor.

“I feel really good about the 

way he played,” Harbaugh said. 
“I feel good about (Peters) now 
taking the next step and being the 
starting 
quarterback.”

A glimpse of the future

M

ichigan fans finally got 
what they asked for.

For weeks now, they 

have been calling for the future.

It started with a loss to 

Michigan State, as the upset 
eliminated any margin for error 
and 
catalyzed 
visions of 
grandeur 
for 2018. 
The idea of 
forsaking 
this season 
in the name 
of playing 
those that 
would 
benefit from experience before 
next year suddenly became 
appealing.

And after the Wolverines were 

thrashed in State College, that 
same plea became deafening.

It was there that the idea finally 

gained some weight. After all, no 
two-loss team has ever made the 
College Football Playoff. A Big Ten 
championship was reduced to a 
hope of a miracle.

Still, Jim Harbaugh said 

nothing to suggest that Michigan 
was suddenly looking to the 
future with no focus on the 
present season. Last Monday, he 
said his team needed to respond 
to the blowout loss. And his 
press conference made it appear 
as if John O’Korn was still the 
Wolverines’ starting quarterback.

So, we knew this day would 

come eventually.

But on Saturday, it came sooner 

than many would have expected.

Michigan fans asked to see the 

future. Harbaugh, in part, granted 
their wish.

It wasn’t only about Brandon 

Peters, the man once dubbed as 
the quarterback of the future, 
who is suddenly very much the 
quarterback of the present.

He is still a large part of it, but 

he was joined by Kareem Walker, 
Nico Collins, Aubrey Solomon, 

Michael Dwumfour, Kwity Paye 
and O’Maury Samuels, too.

Thanks to those six, Saturday 

became a quasi time machine.

Peters received his first 

meaningful college snap in the 
second quarter. He got plenty 
after it — completing 10 of his 
14 attempts for 124 yards and 
leading touchdown drives on three 
consecutive series.

With 23 seconds remaining in 

the first half, he threw a 20-yard 
pass to Chris Evans for the first 
touchdown pass of his career.

As for Walker, the redshirt 

freshman was given a career-high 
six carries and rushed for 34 yards.

And in the third quarter, one of 

those carries ended with Walker 
laying the ball on the end zone turf 
as he wheeled away with a finger 
in the air in celebration. He had 
just scored the first touchdown of 
his career as well.

Solomon was given a starting 

nod for the first time. He turned it 
into a three-tackle performance, 
and combined with Paye for a sack.

Samuels burned his redshirt in 

garbage time, carrying three times 
for seven yards on Michigan’s final 

offensive series.

Collins recorded his first catch, 

a 12-yard reception for a first 
down that set up junior running 
back Karan Higdon’s ensuing 
touchdown rush.

And Dwumfour recorded the 

first sack of his career.

By the end of it all, the 

Wolverines dispatched Rutgers, 
35-14. Six relatively new faces each 
played a part in it. The Michigan 
faithful were gifted with a sense 
of calm — not only for the present, 
but just maybe for the future as 
well.

This is not to say that a crop of 

newcomers’ mostly minimal role 
in a win over the Scarlet Knights 
is cause for celebration. After all, 
Michigan still sits in fourth in the 
Big Ten East, and those conference 
championship hopes still require a 
whole lot of luck.

It doesn’t call for grand 

projections to 2018, either.

But for fleeting moments 

Saturday afternoon, that ‘future’ 
so many have called for finally 
showed out on the field. If Peters 
is an example of anything, it’s that 
slowly but surely, that may become 

more consistent, too.

“I thought he was ready,” 

Harbaugh said of his new starting 
quarterback. “You base a lot of 
things on practice, you know, 
good in practice good in games. 
Now that’s not always the case, 
especially with young players. 
Sometimes they’re not good in 
games. … It was great to see him be 
good in games.

“That’s something where (if) 

players are good in games, that 
helps their confidence, that builds 
their confidence. We all felt good, 
nobody was nervous about what 
was going to happen. I think he did 
better than everyone thought, too.”

That he did, only week after a 

game that ended with Harbaugh 
telling his team that the “fake love” 
was gone. He said it was his team’s 
job to move forward — alone. He 
said that people would be jumping 
off the bandwagon.

But those who didn’t, well, they 

got a nice preview of what could be 
coming.

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
SOCCER
From Page 1A

A core group of upperclassmen 

gathered with coach Chaka 
Daley, intent on getting this team 
on the same page. As Stevens 
admitted, in the past, that wasn’t 
the case. Players would sulk. 
They would talk under their 
breath. But in the meeting, that 
was all buried. A new path began.

“Once some guy sees you bought 

in, they’re like, ‘Alright well I’m 
gonna have to buy in too, otherwise 
I’m not gonna be able to fit well on 
this team,’ ” Stevens said. “There 
was just no room for anybody who 
did not want to buy into this team. 
And you could see it tonight.”

Yes, you could. It took 104 

minutes, 
and 
it 
took 
soul 

searching. But the Wolverines 
had 
captured 
their 
first 

conference title in school history, 
17 years after the program’s 
inception.

As for that No. 2 recruiting 

class, there were just two left to 
hold that trophy Sunday: Tristan 
Jacob, and Stevens.

Ask Stevens if he expected 

this, and even he can’t tell you 
completely. 

He will reflect on his first year, 

when Michigan had no choice 
but to play a brand of soccer it 
didn’t want to.

He will reflect on the moments 

when the talent gradually started 
to fall into place.

And he will admit that he has 

been thinking about it for the 
last few days. It’s for all those 
reasons that this is that much 
sweeter.

“You just can’t make these 

things up man,” Stevens said. 
“… I mean, I’m so proud of this 
group of guys, and it’s just like a 
fairytale ending, man.

***
“Did 
we 
dream 
about 

being 
champs?” 
Daley 
said. 

“Absolutely. 
You 
always 
do. 

But did we think it could be a 
reality after last year and the 
disappointment?”

He didn’t have to think about 

it.

After all, his vision came to 

fruition. He wanted Michigan 
to keep things in perspective. 
He wanted the Wolverines to 
put themselves in a situation 
where they controlled their own 
destiny at the end of the the 
season.

Now, 
that’s 
exactly 
what 

they’re doing. They just needed a 
little bit of luck to get there.

Daley asked his staff if it 

was true at least four times. He 
asked the director of operations, 
too. They checked four or five 
different websites. They checked 
Facebook. They checked Twitter.

Finally, they were certain. 

Michigan State had tied Indiana. 
If it had gone any other way, the 
Wolverines would have never 
had a chance at a Big Ten title. 
Instead, it was theirs for the 
taking.

He told Robbie Mertz first, 

when 
the 
junior 
midfielder 

subbed on in the 71st minute.

Mertz 
spread 
the 
word 

around, but his message didn’t 
reach everybody.

Then came Stevens’ injury in 

the 80th minute — one that he 
would later say was never going 
to keep him off the field Sunday 
night.

That’s when everyone found 

out, for good, what was at stake. 
Score a goal, go home Big Ten 
champions.

“We went for it, no question 

about it,” Daley said. “We went 
for it.”

They got it.
Jack Hallahan sent in a cross 

from the left wing. Mohammed 
Zakyi 
stretched 
as 
far 
as 

humanly possible, couldn’t get 
his foot to it. But Francis 
Atuahene was on the back post 
and the perfect time, getting just 
enough of his foot on the ball to 
notch the golden goal.

Stevens watched it over and 

over again.

“Once it went in, everybody’s 

hearts just dropped,” Stevens 
said, “and you just couldn’t 
believe it.”

We believe you now, Billy.
Even if you still don’t.

Big Ten champions, for the 

first time in its history those 
are words you can finally 
associate with the Michigan 
men’s soccer team.

The Wolverines were able to 

pull off the victory in College 
Park, 2-1, in double overtime, 
clinching the regular season 
conference title.

The game was sealed by 

standout 
junior 
forward 

Francis 
Atuahene, 
he 
was 

able to score with a sliding 
goal that came off the pass 
from sophomore forward Jack 
Hallahan.

The game was all aligned 

for a Maryland win, as it was 
a home game for the more 
experienced Terrapin squad 
that have, for the past couple 
of seasons, overpowered the 
Wolverines. But this season, as 
has become abundantly clear, is 
profoundly different from last.

The 
Wolverines 
weren’t 

fazed, 
scoring 
inside 
the 

first ten minutes of the game 
thanks to a header from junior 
defender Daniel Mukuna.

The weather wasn’t optimal, 

as a rainstorm in Maryland and 
caused for some sloppy play 
at points. But the Wolverines 
looked to be in better control, 
thanks to its preparation.

“Fortunately for the past 

two weeks in Michigan there 
has been some bad weather,” 
said Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 

Daley. 
“We 

have been able 
to 
get 
some 

practices in the 
heavy rain.”

The weather 

played into the 
hands of the 
Wolverines, as 
they controlled 
most 
of 
the 

game. The young Michigan 
team played at their own pace 
and tempo, wearing out the 
Maryland defense.

For much of the game, 

though, it appeared Maryland 
might come close to the crown. 
Late in the first half, forward 
DJ Reeves scored unassisted 
with less than 10 minutes to go.

Most of the second half was a 

game of field position and ball 
possession. 
The 
Wolverines 

were able to get some decent 
looks on goal, but were unable 
to capitalize.

Late in the game, Daley was 

given the news 
that 
his 
team 

was 
given 
the 

chance to win the 
Big Ten title due 
to the overtime 
game 
with 

Michigan 
State. 

With a break in 
the game due to 
a minor injury 
to 
senior 
Billy 

Stevens, 
Daley 

relayed the message to his team 
that they were given the ability 
to become Big Ten Champions 
for the first time in school 

history.

“Once we were sure we told 

the guys,” Daley said. “There 
was a little lift but the guys 
weathered the storm no pun 
intended.”

The first overtime period 

was 
controlled 
by 
the 

Terrapins, but with only a few 
looks on net, they came up 
empty handed.

Knowing 
quite 
well 
it 

would come up shy of the title 
without a goal, the players 
pushed the tempo. Fittingly, 
it was Atuahene, the team’s 
energizer and go-to playmaker 
who scored the championship 
winner. It will go down as 
the most important goal in 
program history.

“It is golden goal is what 

I told the guys,” Daley said. 
“This is your only chance and 
you have to make it.”

The Wolverines didn’t shy 

away 
from 
that 
challenge. 

Instead they relished it, sealing 
their fate and winning the Big 
Ten championship.

MEN’S CROSS COUNTRY
‘M’ wins B1G title

It was a good weekend for the 

Michigan men’s cross country 
team. 

After a lackluster season in 

2016, where the Wolverines 
finished fifth out of 12 teams 
in the Big Ten Championships, 
the Wolverines wanted nothing 
more than a little redemption.

Mission accomplished. 
This year, the 13th-ranked 

Wolverines were favored to win 
the Big Ten Championships by 
the smallest of margins, and 
they defended that position by 
topping 
runner-up 
Michigan 

State by 11 points. Michigan 
led the 12-team bracket with 
71 points to take home the 
championship, headlined by an 
elated group of five fifth-year 
seniors along with a rotation of 
younger athletes.

For Michigan coach Kevin 

Sullivan, it was a little more 
along the lines of relief.

“We were aggressive early, 

which we hadn’t been all year,” 
Sullivan said. “We wanted to 
run up near the front, so early on 
we were aggressive. But really 
the last half mile of the race we 
were bleeding a little bit and 
Michigan State was coming up 
hard, and we gave those guys — 
between (redshirt sophomores) 
Ben Hill and Keenan Rebera 
and (freshman) Jack Aho — a 
half mile to go and said, ‘You 
guys need to catch Michigan 
State’s fifth,’ and they all rallied 
from behind to either outkick 
him or come between a tenth of 
a second, and that’s kind of the 
untold story you don’t see from 
the stats.”

Redshirt 
seniors 
Ben 

Flanagan, Aaron Baumgarten, 
Connor Mora, Billy Bund and 
Micah 
Beller 
all 
remained 

consistent 
throughout 
the 

race, finishing in the top-25. 
In a championship meet, that 
depth gave the Wolverines the 
advantage.

Only the first five runners 

from each team contribute to 
the team’s official score, while 
the 
remaining 
two 
runners 

are meant to displace runners 
from other teams. Michigan 
consolidated most of its runners 
in the top-25, giving it an edge 
over other teams like Michigan 
State and Wisconsin, which had 
higher individual placers but less 
consistency in packs.

“We had good leadership 

up front from Flanagan and 
Baumgarten, Mora, those really 
helped us,” Sullivan said. “But 
what really set us apart from the 
rest of the conference was that 
we were so consistent at four, 
five, six — that depth where we 
had interchangeable parts really 
helped us out today. Because, you 
know, we had a couple guys who 
had off days, and we had a couple 
guys who could step up and fill 
that gap, and you need that to 
have a successful meet.”

One 
of 
those 
consistent 

runners is Flanagan, who was 
the Wolverines’ top individual 
finisher at sixth place, and was a 
leader throughout the race. But 
his biggest contribution to the 
team may come off the course.

“Ben’s just a fantastic leader 

on our team, and he has been 
since I came in his sophomore 
year,” Sullivan said. “He was 
a team captain his sophomore 
year on the team, and I think 
that pretty much tells you all you 
need to know about Ben.

“The way the rest of the team 

looks at him, he’s the kind of guy 
who really grabs his team by the 
scruff after a year like last year 
and said, ‘Hey, we’re not satisfied 
with being in the middle of the 
conference, we want to be a 
team that’s always competing to 
win. Whether we win or not, we 
want to be putting ourselves in a 
position to try and win.’”

Riding an emotional win such 

as this one, Flanagan will have 
to help Michigan buckle down 
moving forward to prepare for 
the Great Lakes Regional, where 
it’ll see top-three finishers in 
Michigan State and Wisconsin. 
Good performances in the meet 
will punch the Wolverines’ ticket 
to the NCAA Championships, 
which could transform a good 
weekend into a great season 
finale.

Michigan’s offensive line sparks 
strong outing from ground game

Michael Onwenu looked out of 

place on the play. In this case, that 
was a good thing.

With just over 14 minutes 

remaining in the fourth quarter, 
Michigan lined up on 1st-and-10 
from the Rutgers 49-yard line. The 
Wolverines ran a counter to the left, 
and Onwenu pulled to that side.

He looked for a man to block. 

What he found was open space, 
enough to make him hesitate, if 
only for a moment.

Karan Higdon found that space 

too, trailing Michigan’s right guard 
before breaking to the left and 
busting the play open for a 49-yard 
touchdown.

By the end of the 35-14 victory, 

the Wolverines had commanded 
their 
way 
to 
four 
rushing 

touchdowns, 6.5 yards per carry 
and two rushers with 100-plus 
yards. They totaled 334 yards 
on the ground — the most since 
Michigan ran for 486 in Piscataway 
last year.

And the Wolverines’ backfield 

can thank Onwenu, and the rest of 
the offensive line, for that.

“I thought our running backs 

played extremely well, but you 
have to start giving the credit to 
the offensive line — a lot of credit to 
the offensive line,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “There 
were some nice big holes. Coach 
Drevno (did) a nice job with the 
run scheme. We had some very 
good schemed-up runs and they 
were executed extremely well. 
Tight ends, fullbacks, receivers, 
and especially the offensive line.”

The 
unit’s 
performance 

wasn’t perfect throughout. On 
the Wolverines’ final drive of 
the third quarter, Higdon was 
dropped twice for loss and redshirt 
freshman quarterback Brandon 
Peters suffered the same fate on a 
broken play.

By the end of the game, though, 

the Scarlet Knights mustered 

just two more tackles-for-loss, 
and didn’t record a single sack — 
something that was paramount for 
a Michigan team giving Peters his 
first meaningful minutes.

“The protection was great all 

day,” Peters said. “We had a great 
game plan coming into the game, 
and we executed it perfectly. It was 
great protection all day.”

Granted, Rutgers isn’t the most 

challenging test for what has been 
a struggling position group for the 
Wolverines. After all, Michigan 
was sacked seven times for 49 
yards and sputtered to just 2.5 
yards per carry in State College 
last weekend.

For 
that 
reason, 
Rutgers’ 

pass-rushing 
and 
run-stopping 

ability was, for the most part, 
irrelevant. 
The 
offensive 
line 

needed to establish, once again, 
that it is capable of protecting its 
quarterback and sparking the 
ground game. And that’s exactly 
what it did.

“My boys had something to 

prove,” Higdon said. “They had a 
‘S’ on their chests. We got a little 
dominated last week against Penn 

State, had some troubles. We knew 
we were better than that, and we 
know what we’re capable of. I 
think it was good to hit adversity 
and bounce back. Those guys are 
tremendous at bouncing back off of 
adversity, and that’s what they did 
today. I’m proud of those guys.”

Higdon, more than anyone, 

reaped the benefits of his line’s 
performance. 
His 
49-yard 

touchdown was the highlight, but 
he finished with a game-high 158 
yards and two touchdowns. More 
impressively, the junior running 
back eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark 
for his career.

It was an honor Higdon wasn’t 

aware of until after the game. It 
was one he didn’t take credit for, 
either.

“I didn’t even think about that, 

but it’s a big-time accomplishment,” 
he said. “It’s very big, especially in 
my career here at the University. 
I give all the credit to the guys 
up front, the guys in front of me. 
Without them, I couldn’t make 
things happen.”

The same, it appears, applies to 

Michigan’s offense as a whole. 

The good, the bad and the ugly: 
Nordin misses short field goal

There’s a new quarterback in 

Ann Arbor. 

After 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback John O’Korn bobbled 
two snaps and got intercepted, 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
knew it was time to make the 
switch.

The 
coaches 
had 
decided 

earlier in the week to play redshirt 
freshman Brandon Peters against 
Rutgers, and in the second quarter 
on Saturday, they implemented 
that plan. Peters came in and led 
Michigan to three consecutive 
touchdown drives and a 35-14 win.

The 
Daily 
breaks 
down 

Michigan’s win in this week’s 
edition of the good, the bad and the 
ugly.

The good
Switching to Peters against 

Rutgers proved to be a great 
decision for the Wolverines. What 
Peters showed in the pocket was 
keen patience and an ability to keep 
plays alive with his feet. He hit 10 
of his 14 pass attempts for a total of 
124 yards and threw a touchdown 

pass to sophomore running back 
Chris Evans as well.

Granted, Peters’ performance 

was against the Scarlet Knights’ 
defense, which is objectively bad. 
Nonetheless, now seems like the 
best time to for Peters to take over 
permanently.

Peters 
has 
two 
favorable 

matchups 
— 
Minnesota 
and 

Maryland — before the season’s 
penultimate 
game 
against 

Wisconsin. The Golden Gophers 
and Terrapins allow an average 
of 184 and 277 passing yards, 
respectively, which should give the 
young quarterback an opportunity 
to showcase his arm. The timing 
should 
allow 
Peters 
to 
get 

comfortable before the real tests 
later in the season.

More 
than 
anything 
else, 

Peters gave the team and the 
fans something to be excited 
about. Peters was Harbaugh’s 
first quarterback recruit, and 
when he walked out for his first 
series, everything changed about 
Michigan’s offense.

It was dynamic, moved the ball 

well and wasn’t one-dimensional, 
like in weeks past.

Peters 
wasn’t 
the 
only 

Wolverine with a big day, though. 
The offensive line also excelled 
specifically in the run game.

Michigan rushed for 334 yards, 

getting major contributions from 
junior Karan Higdon and fifth-
year senior Ty Isaac. A big reason 
for the running backs’ success 
was the offensive line’s blocking. 
Michigan gave up zero sacks, 
and just three of the Wolverines’ 
51 rushing attempts resulted in 
tackles for loss.

The bad
Michigan’s defense failed to stop 

a play that should’ve been familiar.

Last week, when Penn State 

running back Saquon Barkley lined 
up for a direct snap on the second 
play of the game, he burst through 
the Wolverines’ defense untouched 
for a 69-yard touchdown run.

Saturday, 
Rutgers 
receiver 

Janarion Grant also took a few 
direct snaps, and on one of them he 
ran for a 65-yard score.

The 
Wolverines 
ultimately 

bottled up Grant’s direct snaps 
after that play, but failing to stop 
an identical play in back-to-back 
weeks was not a good sign.

The ugly
For the second week in a row, 

redshirt freshman kicker Quinn 
Nordin missed an attempt that 
he should’ve easily converted. He 
botched a PAT against Penn State 
and then missed his only field 
goal attempt against Rutgers — a 
37-yard kick.

Whatever the issue may be, 

Nordin is still going to be the 
Wolverines’ field-goal kicker. He’s 
a fan favorite, and he also carried 
the team at times through the 
first three games of the season. If 
Michigan’s offense runs into red 
zone trouble again, Nordin could 
be called upon, and the Wolverines 
can’t afford to be missing field 
goals and PATs.

Nordin has hit 14 of 17 field 

goals, though, so there is reason to 
believe he can rebound from this 
two-game slump.

Michigan’s offensive line paved the way for the running backs to find holes. 

Five Things We Learned: Peters will be the starting quarterback

It was only Rutgers. But 

Michigan’s 35-14 win over the 
Scarlet Knights felt like so 
much more. 

A step forward for the 

offense, which finally debuted 
its pilot episode of the Brandon 
Peters Show. A return to the 
norm for the defense, which 
was very good only one week 
removed from a rough game 
against Penn State.

So yes, it was just Rutgers. 

But, thanks to their new 
quarterback, the Wolverines 
seem like a different team 
now. And without the weight 
of expectations going forward, 
it’ll be interesting to see just 
how far this young group 
can progress over the final 
month of the regular season. 
Saturday, 
they 
certainly 

moved in the right direction.

Here are five other things 

we learned:

1. Peters will remain the 

starting quarterback

It 
would’ve 
been 

understandable 
for 
Jim 

Harbaugh 
to 
slow 
things 

down following his redshirt 
freshman 
quarterback’s 

performance 
Saturday. 
Of 

course, 
Peters 
performed 

admirably in the first game 
action of his career, but the 
hype 
had 
already 
reached 

unsustainable levels before he 
even completed his first pass 
against the Scarlet Knights.

But Harbaugh — who has 

seemingly been more reserved 
this season than in years past 
— was clearly enthusiastic 
about 
his 
quarterback’s 

performance, 
noting 

that 
Peters 
has 
exceeded 

expectations, and that for 
now, he has a grip on the 
starting job.

“Right now I feel really 

good about the way that he 
played,” Harbaugh said, “and 
feel good about him taking 
the next step and being the 
starting 
quarterback 
and 

having a great week of now 
knowing he’s the starting QB 
in practice.”

2. Higdon continues to 

establish himself

It 
was 
a 
big 
day 
for 

Michigan’s 
junior 
running 

back. Karan Higdon enjoyed a 
career day against Indiana just 
two weeks ago, and his game 
Saturday ranks among his best 
as well: 18 carries for 158 yards 
and two touchdowns. As the 
Wolverines have improved at 
blocking power and counter 
runs, Higdon has benefited. 
Despite his size, he’s a true 
north-south runner who has a 
low center of gravity and good 
speed — qualities that were all 
on display when Higdon sliced 
through the Rutgers defense 
for a 49-yard touchdown run 
in the fourth quarter.

With Saturday’s performance, 

Higdon now has over 1,000 
career rushing yards — and now 
that he has a firm grip on the 
starting running back position 
(in addition to another year of 
eligibility), it’s safe to say he’ll 
be adding a lot more to that 
total.

3. Defense’s 

kryptonite?

There 
isn’t 

much to harp 
about 
with 

this 
defense. 

Penn State did 
bomb 
them 

last week, but 
the 
Nittany 

Lions 
have 

done 
that 
to 

everyone 
this 

year, and that 
seemed like an aberration for 
the 
Wolverines. 
Michigan 

was expected to bounce back 

against a middling Rutgers 
offense, and that was exactly 
what happened.

Rutgers 
quarterback 

Giovanni 
Rescigno 
had 
a 

13.9 quarterback rating, the 
Scarlet Knights averaged just 
three yards per carry and the 

Wolverines gave 
up 
under 
200 

yards of offense 
yet again.

The only error 

that 
Michigan 

made, 
in 
fact, 

was 
a 
65-yard 

touchdown 
run 

by 
Janarion 

Grant. 
The 

lightning 
quick 

receiver 
did 
it 

the 
same 
way 

Saquon Barkley scored his 
first touchdown last week: 
by taking a direct snap and 

outrunning 
everyone. 
But 

that just about does it when it 
comes to any qualms viewers 
could reasonably have after 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 

performance.

4. Offensive line continues 

to march forward

Michigan’s pass-protection 

miscues 
have 
been 
well 

documented this year. The 
offensive line struggled to 
keep Wilton Speight upright, 
it struggled to keep John 
O’Korn clean in the pocket and 
it’s reasonable to assume that 
Peters will take his fair share 
of hits going forward.

But the Wolverines have 

made major strides in the run 
game, and that was evident 
against the Scarlet Knights. 
Peters simply didn’t have to 
do much — his offensive line 
was busy bashing the Rutgers 

defense into the turf. Michigan 
ran 51 times for 334 yards for 
a healthy 6.5 average yards 
per carry. Two running backs 
went for over 100 yards, three 
different rushers scored and 
the Wolverines had over 13 
more minutes of possession.

Running the ball will be 

more difficult when teams like 
No. 3 Ohio State stack the box 
and dare Peters to beat them 
with his arm. But if the run 
game continues developing at 
this pace, that may not matter. 
A 
well-executed 
power 
or 

counter, after all, is nearly 
impossible to stop, and this is 
the most similar Michigan has 
looked to Harbaugh’s well-oiled 
rushing attacks at Stanford. 
Back then, everyone knew what 
was coming — and opponents 
still struggled to defend it. 

5. 
BOLD 
PREDICTION: 

Michigan’s next quarterback 
controversy will take place 
in December

Wilton Speight has gone 

on record saying he hopes 
to be back for Michigan’s 
penultimate regular season 
game, a Nov. 18 date at No. 4 
Wisconsin. But with no shot 
at the playoffs, there’s no 
need for Speight to rush back 
from his traumatic injury. 
The Wolverines might love to 
have a quarterback with his 
experience for the road game 
against the Badgers and a home 
date against the Buckeyes. 
Three broken vertebrae just 
seems like an awfully difficult 
injury to come back from in 
such a short period of time.

Having an extra month to 

rest up before Michigan’s bowl 
game ensures that Speight 
will be fully healthy. And 
once he is, the Wolverines will 
need to deal with yet another 
quarterback 
controversy 
— 

almost regardless of Peters’ 
production the rest of the 
season. 
Speight’s 
eventual 

return and his stake in claiming 
the starting spot will be yet 
another interesting storyline 
in a season full of them.

Changing the equation

W

hen did you realize 
it was time?

Was it after the 

first interception? Was it when 
a routine snap was bobbled and 
fumbled for a 14-yard loss?

At first, it appeared 

Michigan’s fourth drive 
spurred the action: a second 
fumbled snap and then two 
incomplete passes as boos 
cascaded 
down upon 
the field.

Those 

boos 
quickly 
turned 
into cheers 
once 
Brandon 
Peters 
entered 
the game on the following 
drive, injecting the crowd with 
an excitement rarely seen this 
year.

After the game, though, Jim 

Harbaugh cleared the air — the 
Peters era was always going 
to begin Saturday afternoon, 
regardless of fifth-year senior 
John O’Korn’s early struggles.

“We had made that decision 

well before the game,” 
Harbaugh said after Michigan’s 
35-14 win over Rutgers. “It was 
time. It was time for him to 
play.”

Harbaugh said the situation 

was “like a bird leaving the 
nest.” And to the relief of 
Michigan and its fans, Peters 
had little trouble spreading his 
wings.

According to Harbaugh, the 

redshirt freshman quarterback 
exceeded expectations by 
completing 10-of-14 passes for 
124 yards and one touchdown.

Karan Higdon was asked 

what felt different about the 
offense with Peters. The junior 
running back didn’t answer 
the question. He didn’t have to 
— quite simply, everything felt 

different.

The Wolverines scored 

touchdowns on three 
consecutive possessions for 
just the second time this 
season. They made it look easy, 
all with a gameplan that could 
be described as vanilla.

That was the biggest 

difference between Peters and 
his new backup. He did all the 
simple tasks that were asked 
of him.

Peters went through his 

progressions. He worked the 
naked bootleg. He checked 
down and picked up easy yards. 
He hit curl routes. He read 
zone coverages. Eight of his 
10 completions went for first 
downs.

One of the other two went 

for the first touchdown pass 
of his career — a pass that 
displayed the talent that made 
Peters such a highly-touted 
recruit and had everyone 
clamoring to see him on the 
field.

There weren’t any flashy 

deep balls or any 15-yard 
outs that would’ve left NFL 
scouts salivating. Still, this 
was a paradigm-shifting 
performance.

With this defense, Michigan 

doesn’t need sustained 
brilliance from the man under 
center. It just needs someone 
who can do enough to keep 
opposing defenses honest 
against a flurry of power and 
counter runs.

What Peters did on that 

20-yard touchdown pass to 
Chris Evans? That’s the cherry 
on top. If Peters can replicate 
what he did Saturday going 
forward — especially on the 
last two Saturdays of November 
— you’ll be looking at a team 
that can play its way to a bowl 
game on New Year’s Day.

“Every drive, he was moving 

the team,” Harbaugh said. 
“Touchdown drive with the 

two-minute drill, 80-yard 
drive, 75-yard drive, starting 
his first series in football and 
(as?) starting quarterback. … I 
think it’d be very good for his 
confidence to build on that.”

Of course, the obvious 

question remains: why did it 
take so long?

For Peters, it all had to do 

with his ability to command 
the huddle and be a vocal 
presence. That ability lagged 
behind his natural athleticism, 
behind the natural arm talent.

It might’ve taken some 

prodding — Devin Bush Jr. said 
with a smile that he constantly 
teased his classmate about not 
being loud enough — but that 
ability is finally catching up 
with the rest of Peters’ game.

“Probably late in training 

camp, it was like, ‘Wow, he’s a 
lot louder,’ ” Harbaugh said. “... 

Felt that he was ready, and time 
to get him in.”

Added Bush: “I feel like in 

the fall, (Peters) broke out of 
that shell and started taking a 
grasp of that offense.”

Peters might be a naturally 

“shy guy” who doesn’t show 
much emotion.

Yet it’s doubtful anyone will 

care if he continues to play like 
he did Saturday.

“Right now, I feel really good 

about the way that (Peters) 
played,” Harbaugh said, “and 
feel good about him taking the 
next step and being the starting 
quarterback and having a great 
week of now knowing he’s 
the starting quarterback in 
practice.”

Michigan splits series with No. 15 Penn State, 
bounces back for 5-2 victory Saturday night

STATE COLLEGE — Some 

statements take less time to 
make than others.

With just over five minutes 

left to play in the second 
period 
Saturday, 
Michigan 

senior forward Tony Calderone 
received senior forward Dexter 
Dancs’ pass, took his time on 
the puck and fired it past Penn 
State goaltender Peyton Jones 
from the top of the crease for his 
second goal of the game.

Before the Nittany Lions had a 

chance to blink, the Wolverines 
had another, as junior forward 
Brendan Warren ripped a shot 
off a face off into the top left 
corner.

In just nine seconds, Michigan 

went from desperately protecting 
a 1-0 lead to having a comfortable 
three-goal cushion, and was well 
on its way to a decisive 5-2 victory 
over No. 15 Penn State (2-2 Big 
Ten, 4-4 overall) at Pegula Ice 
Arena, proving not only that the 
Wolverines could hang with the 
Big Ten’s best, but beat them as 
well.

For much of the contest, one 

could have been forgiven for 
thinking they were watching the 
same game as they had watched 
the night before.

Just 
as 
they 
did 
Friday 

night, 
Michigan 
(1-1, 
4-2) 

withstood early Nittany Lion 
pressure before jumping on the 
scoreboard first. Four minutes 
into the game, Calderone took a 
pass from junior forward Cooper 
Marody and although his initial 
attempt was saved, Calderone 
stayed with it and directed the 
puck past Jones into the net.

The 
physical 
nature 
of 

Friday’s 
game 
extended 
to 

Saturday as well. Seven minutes 
in, sophomore forward Will 
Lockwood unloaded a massive 
hit on Penn State defenseman 
Cole Hults while chasing after 
the puck near the boards. After a 
small scrum ensued, Lockwood 
was assessed a major penalty 
for boarding. But thanks to four 
saves by sophomore goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne, the Wolverines 
escaped the penalty kill with its 
lead intact.

“(That was) big time,” said 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“With their power play that can 
totally change things, you can 

get behind by a couple, crowd 
gets into it, so that was one of 
the keys to the game.”

Michigan 
killed 
a 
second 

penalty late in the period, but 
not without a close call. With 
just under two minutes left in 
the first, Alex Limoges’ shot from 
the right side deflected off junior 
defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi, 

but Lavigne prevented it from 
crossing the line — a decision 
which was upheld upon review.

Lavigne stopped all 14 shots 

that came his way in the first 
period, and finished with 42 
saves in facing 44 shots. Thanks 
to this effort, the Wolverines 
took a lead into the locker room 
for a second straight night, 
despite having been outshot, 
14-4. 
Lavigne’s 
performance 

came after a 49-save effort by 
sophomore Jack LaFontaine on 
Friday.

“We’ve rotated them right 

from day one and it looks 
like that’s going to continue,” 
Pearson said. “If they’re both 
playing, that means they’re both 
playing well.”

The 
game’s 
chippy 
tone 

continued 
to 
escalate 

throughout the second period. 

Seconds after Lockwood was 
penalized 
for 
interference, 

freshman forward Josh Norris 
and Nittany Lions forward Brett 
Murray were both sent to the box 
for unsportsmanlike conduct 
with just under 14 minutes left 
in the second. Seemingly every 
check or scrum in the crease was 
met with a standoff between the 
opposing players.

“Some 
things 
sometimes 

happen and guys go down,” 
Pearson said. “But we’ve got to 
be more disciplined.” 

Penn 
State 
responded 
to 

Michigan’s flurry when center 
Nate Sucese drilled a long-range 
shot through Lavigne’s legs. But 
any spark the Nittany Lions may 
have received following that 
goal failed to materialize.

The Wolverines put the game 

to bed with two goals in quick 
succession. Dancs scored his 
third goal of the weekend with 
just under 16 minutes left in the 
final period, and sophomore 
forward Nick Pastujov wrapped 
a shot around Jones just 74 
seconds later.

With 11:33 remaining, Penn 

State forward Nikita Pavlychev 
scored a consolation goal to 
create the final margin.

Michigan accrued 18 penalty 

minutes compared to just eight 
for Penn State. But the Nittany 
Lions, who entered the weekend 
ranked 
sixth 
nationally 
in 

power-play percentage, failed 
to convert on any of their five 
power-play opportunities, and 
were scoreless with the man 
advantage in both games, going 
0-for-8.

“Our 
penalty 
kill 
was 

awesome,” 
Calderone 
said. 

“They couldn’t have been better 
tonight. I don’t know exact stats, 
but they came up big, blocked 
shots — awesome work by those 
guys.”

On Friday, the Wolverines 

were one minute away from 
sending a message to the rest 
of the Big Ten. And Saturday, 
behind an improved defense and 
efficient 
finishing, 
Michigan 

delivered that message.

‘M’ defense leads the 
way to weekend split

Sophomore 
right 
wing 

Will 
Lockwood 
leveled 
a 

Nittany Lion defenseman into 
the board Saturday, quickly 
drawing ire — and the tweet of 
a whistle — from an official. 

But while the hit wasn’t 

glamorous and sent Lockwood 
to the penalty box for five 
minutes, it still represented 
a 
Michigan 
hockey 
team 

committed 
to 
all-around 

defense.

“Last night we talked about 

not going anywhere giving up 
five goals against anybody,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 

Pearson. 
“And 
we’ve 
got 

to buy in and make a total 
commitment to team defense.”

Sophomore 
goaltenders 

Jack LaFontaine and Hayden 
Lavigne did their part of 
the job, recording 49 and 42 
saves, respectively, in a pair 
of 
up-and-down 
defensive 

performances that saw the 
Wolverines earn a split in their 
Big Ten opening series against 
No. 15 Penn State.

As the clock ran past the 

10-minute mark in the second 
period 
Saturday, 
Michigan 

was leading the Nittany Lions, 
3-0. The Wolverines had seen 
an eerily similar situation the 
night before.

Leading by two goals, the 

Michigan front seemed caught 
off-guard when the Nittany 
Lions brought an onslaught 
of 
offense 
that 
ultimately 

granted them an overtime win 
in the series debut.

However, 
determined 
to 

put a disappointing late-game 
loss the night before behind 
them, the Wolverines entered 
Saturday with a clean-slate 
mentality that would afford 
them a dominant 5-2 victory.

They 
didn’t 
just 
will 

themselves 
to 
a 
win 
on 

Saturday, 
though. 
In 
fact, 

Michigan 
looked 
like 
a 

completely 
different 
group. 

And that was the reason 
Pearson didn’t see his team 
give up the five comeback 
goals that Penn State had 
netted Friday.

This 
time, 
29 
blocked 

shots, a mean defensive front 
and a stellar performance 
from Lavigne allowed the 
Wolverines to keep their lead. 
Even 
while 
its 
aggressive 

defensive mentality afforded 
Michigan 
nine 
penalties 

Saturday, 
its 
penalty 
kills 

seemed to have new legs to 
stand on as well.

“They 
had 
some 

opportunities,” 
Pearson 

said. “Hayden Lavigne and 
LaFontaine 
were 
our 
best 

penalty killers. They did a real 
nice job, but we blocked a lot of 
shots too.”

Despite 11 shots by the 

Penn State offense during the 
period, 
Lavigne’s 
prowess 

in front of the net and solid 
performances from the likes 
of 
sophomore 
defenseman 

Griffin Luce and junior left 
wing Brendan Warren killed 
off the penalty.

An even truer testament 

to 
the 
durability 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ back line was its 
ability to hold the Nittany 
Lions to one goal in the third 
period Saturday opposed to 
the three – one in overtime – 
that it had given up the night 
before.

“It’s huge. I think we learned 

from our mistakes last night 
– we made a lot,” said senior 
right wing Tony Calderone. 
“And early in the season we 
hadn’t played with too many 
leads, but we watched video 
and (were) able to come out 
tonight 
and 
correct 
those 

mistakes.”

While 
the 
Wolverines’ 

record 
reflects 
a 
weekend 

that was evenly split, unlucky 
late-game breaks Friday and a 
dominant rout Saturday proved 
that Michigan has the ability 
to compete against some of the 
top teams in the nation.

FOOTBALL
Evans finds end zone

Chris 
Evans 
stood 
beside 

Brandon Peters as the redshirt 
freshman quarterback called for 
the snap.

The two were on a single 

wavelength. 
The 
sophomore 

running back took off sprinting to 
his right before the ball even hit 
Peters’ hands. It didn’t stay in his 
hands for very long, either.

Evans burst through the open 

space, using his standout speed 
to leave the defensive lineman 
assigned to pick him up in the 
dust. Peters took a short hop and 
then launched a pass right over the 
shoulder of the Rutgers defender, 
who wasn’t even looking the right 
way when Evans corralled the ball 
in his grasp and landed in the end 
zone.

“I saw man coverage, a one-on-

one with Chris,” Peters said. “I just 
read it out, gave him a chance on 
the play. He made a great catch.

“... It was a great playcall, and it 

worked out good.”

Evans jumped to his feet and 

pumped his fist in the air in 
celebration. The gesture was a 
mixture of excitement and relief 
for Michigan.

With 23 seconds left in the first 

half, the Wolverines finally had 
some breathing room against the 
Scarlet Knights in the form of a 21-7 
lead. The 20-yard score was Evans’ 
first touchdown — and Michigan’s 
first passing touchdown — since 
the Purdue game on Sept. 23.

“I thought Chris made a heck of 

a catch on it,” said Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh. “Thought Brandon 
saw it well — good protection — 
and Brandon put it a little short, but 
Chris adjusted well to the ball and 
made a nice catch.”

In Saturday’s 35-14 win, the 

Wolverines targeted 10 different 
receivers in an effort to jumpstart 
their struggling passing game. 
Evans was the only one who 
came away with a touchdown. If 
not for sophomore tight end Sean 
McKeon, who caught two more 

passes and finished with 11 more 
yards, Evans would have been 
Michigan’s leading receiver.

It may have only been one catch, 

but until the game wound down in 
the fourth quarter, Evans only had 
one carry as well.

In the Wolverines’ three-back 

rotation, Evans has occupied the 
third spot, behind junior Karan 
Higdon and fifth-year senior Ty 
Isaac. Saturday, he fell to fourth, 
behind redshirt freshman Kareem 
Walker.

Walker earned six carries and 

gained 34 yards against Rutgers, 
including a 13-yard touchdown 
— the first of his Michigan career 
— before leaving the game in the 
fourth quarter with a sprained 
ankle. Though it hasn’t been 
announced if the injury will force 
him to miss any time, Walker’s 
emergence could diminish Evans’ 
role in the rotation even further.

But 
that 
touchdown 
catch 

demonstrated how much Evans 
still has to offer the Wolverines 
on the field. With freshman Tarik 
Black’s 
season-ending 
injury 

and sophomore Kekoa Crawford 
sitting out Saturday’s game for 
undisclosed reasons, Evans could 
become a receiving threat despite 
limited touches in the ground 
game.

Michigan’s 
wideout 
options 

still include junior Grant Perry 
and sophomore Eddie McDoom, 
as well as McKeon and redshirt 
sophomore tight end Zach Gentry. 
But Saturday, he topped nearly all 
of them with one contortion of his 
body.

Though the Wolverines gained 

137 yards in the air, the total still 
fell far short of the ground game’s 
334-yard outing. While that is a 
good sign for the running backs 
rotation, it isn’t for Evans, who 
wasn’t needed in the backfield.

With Peters taking over under 

center for the foreseeable future, 
the redshirt freshman will need 
reliable targets in order to breathe 
life into Michigan’s passing game.

He and Evans showed they 

already have a connection.
