Weiser sought Regents’ support after calls for his
 resignation: “Remember Germany in the 1930s”

ADMINISTRATION

Newly-elected GOP Chair sent multiple controversial emails to board over past year

University of Michigan Regent 

Ron Weiser (R) has sent emails to 
his fellow regents during the last 
year comparing the board’s silence 
in the face of recent calls for his 
resignation to “Germany in the 
1930’s,” calling graduate student 
protesters “hired union hacks” 
and one containing only a picture 
of a bikini-clad woman.

The 
emails, 
obtained 
by 

The Michigan Daily, were first 
reported by WDET. 

Some in the U-M community 

demanded Weiser’s resignation 
following the Jan. 6 insurrection at 
the Capitol because they thought 
he inadequately addressed the 
incident. Weiser called on the 
board to support him in a Jan. 17 
email to the Board of Regents, 
U-M President Mark Schlissel and 
U-M Secretary Sally Churchill. 

“Their issues are not about 

anything I have done or said only 
about being a Republican Leader 
and not saying exactly what they 
want me to say (it varies with some 
of them actually saying I’m anti-
Semitic),” Weiser wrote. “It might 
be nice if part or all of my fellow 
Board Members say something 
about my service or largess to the 
University. Silence has historical 

consequences. 
Remember 

Germany in the 1930’s.”

None of the regents have 

followed through on Weiser’s 
request to comment publicly on 
the matter. 

When asked by The Daily in a 

previous interview about the calls 
for Weiser’s resignation, Schlissel 
said questions about Weiser’s 
political associations and activities 
within the Republican Party are 

questions for Weiser, not the 
University, to answer. He pointed 
out regents are accountable to the 
public through statewide popular 
vote every eight years. 

“I think that the many faculty 

and students in the community 
and others that have objections 
are 
raising 
those 
objections, 

they’re getting lots of coverage 
in the media, and those fall into 
the political process,” Schlissel 

said. “It’ll have to be worked out, 
but I can say that the University 
itself, as well as all the regents, 
unambiguously 
condemn 
the 

violence and those that incited 
the violence. That’s not a matter of 
question.”

Weiser 
has 
sent 
other 

questionable emails to the U-M 
administration. In an April email 
to the board, Weiser relayed 
an 
anecdote 
from 
his 
wife 

about a Graduate Employees’ 
Organization car demonstration 
outside the Weiser residence 
during 
bargaining 
with 
the 

University at the time.

“I suspect these are hired union 

hacks,” Weiser’s email reads. 
“The lead person truly has no 
idea of U governance, he was sure 
the U was a for profit business. 
While he was cleanly dressed it 
was impossible to imagine him in 
a classroom. Janitor maybe from 
the mental content.”

Additionally, on May 1, 2020, 

Weiser sent an email to the 
regents containing only a selfie 
of a woman in sunglasses and 
a bikini top laying on a towel. 
The subject of the email is “BB.” 
The Daily is not publishing the 
photo as it is unable to verify the 
woman’s identity and to protect 
her privacy.

The University of Michigan’s 

class of 2021 spring commencement 
will be held virtually amid the 
COVID-19 pandemic, as announced 
in an email by University of 
Michigan President Mark Schlissel 
Thursday morning.

The 
announcement 
comes 

after a two-week stay-in-place 
recommendation for the University 
by Washtenaw County Health 
Department, 
and 
currently, 

COVID-19 cases at the University 
account for more than 34% of the 
cases in the county.

The commencement ceremony is 

scheduled for May 1 with plans for 
synchronous content that will be 
recorded and available for viewing 
afterwards. According to the email, 
the University is also working to 
provide virtual performances, host 
interactive elements and bring an 
inspiring main speaker.

Schlissel noted the decision 

was carefully considered, pointing 
to the uncertainty around future 
gathering sizes, travel restrictions, 
infection rates and vaccination rates 
as strong factors. He acknowledged 
the community impact of holding a 
virtual ceremony in his email. 

“We very much wish that we 

could hold a safe commencement in 
Michigan Stadium, along with the 
many other celebration activities 
that are a fundamental part of our 
community life and traditions,” 
Schlissel wrote. “Commencement 
is the most joyous event of the 
academic year for many in our 
community, as we celebrate the 
accomplishments of our graduates 
and draw inspiration from the 
achievements they will share with 
our world.”

The class of 2020 also received 

a 
virtual 
spring 
and 
winter 

commencement 
ceremony, 

making this the third ceremony 
that has been affected by the 
pandemic. 
Schlissel 
stated 
all 

graduates affected by the pandemic 
are 
welcome 
to 
any 
future 

commencement of their choosing.

“They and their families will 

be our honored guests at these 
ceremonies, and the graduates 
will be recognized not just for 
the completion of their degrees, 
but also for their resilience and 
fortitude in persevering during 
these challenging times,” Schlissel 
wrote.

According to the email, the 

University also hopes to invite both 
classes back in the future for special 
future in-person celebrations.

For future updates about the 

spring commencement, the email 
encourages students to visit the 
commencement website.

CAMPUS LIFE
Class of 2021 to receive virtual 
commencement ceremony

Dr. Howard Markel, director 

of the University of Michigan’s 
Center 
for 
the 
History 

of 
Medicine, 
has 
written 

extensively 
on 
American 

pandemics, as well as on the 
political uses of quarantine and 
isolation. The Michigan Daily 
spoke with Markel over the 
phone last month to hear more 
about his work as a doctor and 
scholar during the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Markel began by explaining 

how he co-authored a paper 
with his colleague Dr. Marty 
Citron on “flattening the curve” 
in 
2007, 
which 
suggested 

that cases are reduced when 
social 
distancing 
measures 

are 
implemented. 
Citron 

visualized data into a curve, 
now considered by many to be a 
defining public health image of 
COVID-19.

Markel said his work on 

flattening the curve began in 
2005 in the era of the H5N1 avian 
flu. Citron, who worked as the 
head of the Division of Global 
Migration and Quarantine at the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, would frequently 
travel with Markel to give 
presentations. 
Usually, 
their 

trips took them to Atlanta or to 
Washington, D.C. 

“I knew the room service 

menu at the hotel I stayed in 
by heart,” Markel recalled. “I 
always ordered the same thing. I 
can even tell you: chicken with a 
mustard sauce and rice.” 

Markel said he coined the 

term “flattening the curve” 
while 
opening 
a 
takeout 

container of pad thai, which 
looked like a flat curve.

“When I took out the pad 

thai, it was all flat like one giant 
noodle,” he explained. “I said: 
‘it’s just like the curve. It’s flat!’ 
So, that’s where ‘flattening the 
curve’ came from.” 

Markel 
said 
the 

implementation 
of 
social 

distancing measures in Mexico 
during 
the 
2009 
influenza 

epidemic became the pair’s first 
living “laboratory” for their 
concept. At the time, Markel 
said he and Citron noticed 
that 
though 
the 
influenza 

epidemic was not as deadly as 
some feared, the application 
of social distancing measures 
had the desired effect they’d 
predicted: They extended the 
preparation time allotted to the 
Mexican government, ensuring 
its hospitals were able to see 
a smaller and therefore more 
manageable influx of patients. 

Despite 
the 
reduction 
in 

cases, Markel said he and Citron 
encountered strong doubt — 
and outright dismissal — when 
they presented their work to 
the public in the early 2010’s. 
Markel said he experienced 
contradictory emotions when 
seeing his life’s work suddenly 
become so relevant during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

“We didn’t have a crisis to 

apply this to until now,” Markel 
said. 
“It’s 
been 
incredibly 

exciting for me as a scholar and 
a professor, and as an observer, 
I’ve been horrified.”

While social distancing is 

“the nuclear option” because it 
is so disruptive to how society 
functions, 
Markel 
said 
it 

remains necessary for putting an 
end to the COVID-19 pandemic 
and, despite disagreements over 
public health programs and 
policies, the country needs a 
centralized program.

Restaurants face complications 
in resuming indoor dining

BUSINESS

Even with Gov. Whitmer’s approval, some businesses hesitant to fully reopen

On Jan. 22 — six days after 

the first case of the COVID-19 
B.1.1.7 variant was first detected 
in Washtenaw County — Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer announced 
indoor dining could resume at 
25% capacity on Feb. 1. Just three 
days after the announcement, 
the Washtenaw County Health 
Department imposed a stay in 
place recommendation on the 
University of Michigan.

Now 
that 
businesses 
can 

finally open, the stay in place 
recommendation has introduced 
further 
complications. 
This 

resumption comes after nearly 
three months of restaurants being 
restricted to takeout and outdoor 
dining under Gov. Whitmer’s Nov. 
15 “Pause to Save Lives” executive 
order, which was met with 
frustration from local business 
owners. 

The 
stay 
in 
place 

recommendation, which is similar 
in structure to the October 2020 
stay at home order, asks students 
not to leave their residences 
except for essential activities 

such as in-person classes, work or 
research that cannot be completed 
remotely, 
obtaining 
food 
or 

medical care and other approved 
activities until 11:59 P.M on Feb. 
7. Unlike the first order, however, 
the 
recommendation 
didn’t 

explicitly ban indoor dining. 

Jerusalem Garden owner Ali 

Ramlawi, a City Council member 
for Ward 5, said the stay in place 
recommendation didn’t impact 
his business nearly as drastically 
as the October order, mostly 
because they have only been open 
for outdoor or carry out dining 
since June. 

“We’re not seeing a noticeable 

decrease — maybe a 5-10% drop,” 
Ramlawi said. “It has been a little 
slower, but it’s hard to pinpoint 
when you’re not doing much in 
sales.” 

LSA 
freshman 
Meredith 

Dirkman said while she plans to 
avoid sit-down restaurants and 
utilize takeout until the stay-at-
home recommendation expires, 
she is comfortable with the steps 
restaurants have taken to keep 
guests safe and would be willing 
to eat at one.

TESS CROWLEY/Daily

After a night of record-breaking temperatures and snowfall, residents of Ann Arbor came together to adorn the wintry landscape with cheerful snowmen outside their residences.

President Joe Biden is expected 

to nominate Michael Barr, dean 
of the University of Michigan’s 
Ford School of Public Policy, as 
comptroller of the currency, a 
role that involves regulation of 
the banking industry. Following 
the initial report from The 
Wall 
Street 
Journal, 
some 

Democrats 
are 
disappointed 

with the appointment, preferring 
University 
of 
California-

Irvine law professor and more 
progressive candidate Mehrsa 
Baradaran over Barr.

As comptroller of the currency, 

Barr would be in charge of 
overseeing and regulating the 
federal banking system, ensuring 
banks operate in a safe manner 
and setting the standards for 
their activities in minority and 
low-income areas.

Barr 
previously 
criticized 

the 
Trump 
administration’s 

handling of banking regulation, 
such as a reduction in consumer 
protection laws and the lack 
of action taken to address the 
COVID-19 pandemic, which have 
had detrimental effects on banks.

Barr 
worked 
in 
several 

Treasury and State Department 
roles 
during 
the 
Clinton 

administration and served as an 
assistant secretary of the treasury 
under the Obama administration. 
Barr contributed to the 2010 
Dodd-Frank Act, which changed 
financial regulations to reduce 
the economic impact of the 2008 
Great Recession.

The Michigan Daily spoke 

to some progressive University 
of Michigan students to gauge 
their thoughts on Barr’s likely 
nomination.

Public Policy senior Kerrigan 

McCabe believes that Barr’s 
previous experience makes him 
well fit for comptroller of the 
currency.

“Barr has such a long history 

working on economic regulations 
and protecting consumers, so 
I think he’s very well fit for 
the job,” McCabe said. “Barr’s 
appointment makes sense with 
what the Biden administration 
has promised voters about what 
the economic landscape is going 
to look like in the future.”

Recently, 
Barr 
served 
as 

an 
adviser 
to 
the 
Alliance 

for Innovative Regulation, a 
nonprofit representing financial 
technology firms, which attempts 
to merge financial regulation and 
digital design. 

Critics believe this position 

should 
disqualify 
Barr 
from 

the 
Biden 
administration 

appointment, as the position 
would allow him to grant bank 
charters to companies, including 
firms the Alliance for Innovative 
Regulation may have advised.

Public Policy junior Tuhin 

Chakraborty said he supports 
Barr’s possible appointment and 
disagrees with critics who say his 
financial technology experience 
should disqualify him.

“Fintech 
companies 
are 

rapidly coming into the future 
of the banking and finance 
industries, so Barr’s knowledge of 
tech and future technology will 
be invaluable to revolutionizing 
the finance sector in the coming 
years,” Chakraborty said. “It’s 
easier to work with someone you 
are familiar with. I’d say Barr’s 
work with fintech is the exact 
opposite of a disqualification.”

However, Public Policy junior 

Alexander Zittleman, the action 
co-chair of the Young Democratic 
Socialists of America chapter 
at the University, said he thinks 
Barr should not be appointed to 
the position. 

“I think Barr’s experience with 

fintech firms shows that he’s not 
the right option,” Zittleman said. 
“I don’t think it’s automatically 
disqualifying, but there are other 
candidates who don’t have that 
experience and who aren’t liable 
to having that as their main 
priority.”

Baradaran, 
the 
other 

candidate favored by some, has 
previously 
championed 
racial 

equity and closing the wealth 
gap, 
something 
progressives 

think would make her a good 
choice for comptroller of the 
currency. 

Following 
Biden’s 
repeated 

calls for unity — not only across 
partisan lines but within the 
Democratic 
party 
itself 
— 

many hoped progressives such 
as 
Baradaran 
would 
receive 

appointments. 

Public Policy junior Reuben 

Glasser, resident and founder of 
Michigan Political Consulting, 
wrote in an email to The Daily he 
believes Barr will also be able to 
address the issues of racial equity 
that Baradaran has promoted.

“While I strongly agree that 

closing the racial wealth gap 
should be one of the focuses 
of our Banking Regulator, I’m 
unsure how that disqualifies 
Dean Barr,” Glasser wrote. “I 
have strong faith he will do 
everything in his power to work 
with the administration and 
Congress to do so, while also 

doing a fantastic job on a plethora 
of other issues.”

Recent Public Policy graduate 

Brooke 
Bacigal 
agreed 
with 

Glasser, writing in a statement to 
The Daily she hoped Barr would 
prioritize addressing issues of 
systemic injustice he frequently 
spoke about as dean. 

“In an email to the Ford 

community this past summer 
addressing racial violence and 
police brutality he said ‘as policy 
professionals, we must commit 
ourselves to addressing these 
public challenges, difficulties, 
and 
social 
ills 
directly,’” 

Bacigal wrote. “Now with the 
opportunity to do exactly that, I 
hope that as Comptroller, Dean 
Barr will prioritize addressing 
the 
systemic 
barriers 
that 

have 
perpetuated 
racialized 

economic inequality, strengthen 
financial inclusion and banking 
protections 
for 
minority 

communities, and employ the 
same 
post-crisis 
construction 

of regulations as he did with his 
work on Dodd-Frank, steering 
the OCC.”

Historically, Barr has been 

resistant to more progressive 
limitations 
on 
the 
industry 

suggested by lawmakers, such as 
a stricter version of the Volcker 
Rule, 
which 
prevents 
banks 

from using depositors’ money for 
certain investment activities and 
limits their dealing with covered 
funds.

After the election, in an email 

to Public Policy students, Barr 
congratulated Biden and Harris 
on their win and emphasized the 
importance of working across the 
aisle. 

“I also think it is fair to say, 

that those who have worked 
with President-elect Biden, from 
across the political spectrum, 
whether 
or 
not 
they 
agree 

with him on policy or politics, 
view him as a person of great 
personal integrity, decency, and 
compassion,” Barr wrote.

Chakraborty said he thinks 

Barr’s 
moderate 
stance 
will 

allow for more legislation to be 
passed, as Democrats only have 

50 seats in the Senate — not 
enough to pass legislation with 
the filibuster-proof majority that 
is often necessary. 

“By no means (do Democrats) 

have a mandate to push forth this 
stronger, more progressive clause 
of the Volcker Rule,” Chakraborty 
said. “Barr will moderate policies 
and make them more palatable 
to both the GOP and Democrats 
and will help more efficiently put 
forth bipartisan solutions that 
will be more feasible to turn into 
law.”

On the other hand, Zittleman 

said he believes Baradaran’s 
progressive stance would bring 
about more positive change.

“A lot of the things that 

Baradaran supports are things 
that would directly address issues 
like racial and intergenerational 
wealth 
equality,” 
Zittleman 

said. “Is Biden unifying with 
Republicans across the aisle 
trying to come up with neoliberal 
policy agendas that can work 
for both sides, or is he trying to 
combat white supremacy and 
unify with this multicultural 
tapestry that is America?”

But Glasser emphasized the 

importance 
of 
bipartisanship 

across party lines.

“Right now the country is in 

a bit of disarray on every side, I 
think the choice we, Americans, 
made to elect Biden is a choice of 
healing — in hopes both sides can 
work together,” Glasser wrote. 
“If Dean Barr is a result of trying 
to cultivate more bipartisanship, 
more conversation and better 
results for America, I’m all with 
it.”

Chakraborty 
agreed 
with 

Glasser, stating that unification is 
something Barr would promote. 

“Being able to efficiently work 

with both parties will produce 
the most viable policy that has 
the highest chances of becoming 
law,” Chakraborty said. “It’s 
political, uniting and efficient.”

Activist, scholar LaTosha Brown hosts 
Black History Month kickoff event
Speaker encourages students to “reimagine how we can better our world”

To begin this month’s Black 

History Month celebrations, 
LaTosha Brown, co-founder of 
the Black Voters Matter Fund 
and a 2020-2021 American 
Democracy Fellow at Harvard 
University, 
discussed 
civic 

engagement, voter suppression 
and political power in the 
21st century at a virtual event 
Monday evening. 

Hosted by the University 

of Michigan Office of Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs, the 
event marked the start of a 
month dedicated to honoring, 
informing 
and 
recognizing 

the important role that Black 
people 
play 
in 
American 

history. 

Brown not only spoke on the 

significance of Black History 
Month but also shared personal 
experiences. She began her 
lecture 
by 
singing 
a 
song 

discussing how her hometown 
of Selma, Ala., influenced her 
political activism today. 

 “Well, the first thing I did 

right was the day I started to 
fight,” Brown sang. “Keep your 
eyes on the prize and hold on.” 

Brown’s vocals and use of 

music during her talk resonated 
with many attendees, including 
Music, Theatre & Dance senior 
Jack Williams III. 

 “It was really beautiful to 

not only hear her sing, but to 
also hear her stories about 
how music has helped shape 
her life and shape her work, 
and about the ways in which 
music is being used time and 
time again,” Williams said. 
“If you look at old videos from 
the Civil Rights Movement, 
you will see them singing as 

they’re marching. It just makes 
me think of the ways in which 
Black people have used their 
voices time and time again to 
enact change.”

Despite the bleak history 

that often accompanies her 
tune, Brown said this song is 
also optimistic because it is an 
anthem for political activism. 

 “It was being created and 

raised within the context of 
people who had that song in 
their 
heart 
that 
ultimately 

shaped me into the person I am 
today,” Brown said. 

Brown 
carried 
this 
tone 

of positivity into addressing 
President Joe Biden’s victory 
in the 2020 election. She said 
people have a responsibility 
to be civically engaged and 
cognizant of the policies that 
impact their day-to-day lives.

 “We want people to believe 

that they have agency and the 
right to govern themselves,” 
Brown 
said. 
“Every 
single 

aspect of our lives is impacted 
by policy. We’re not asking you 
to believe in the system. We’re 
asking you to believe in your 
agency and power. You’ve got 
to show up.” 

Brown urged the audience 

to 
continue 
fighting 
for 

democracy, 
noting 
that 

democracy has always been a 
threat to white supremacy.

“Democracy 
has 
been 

a 
vehicle 
for 
American 

exceptionalism 
to 
hide 

behind,” Brown said. “At the 
same time that we were having 
lofty ideas that all men are 
created equal and endowed 
by 
their 
creator, 
we 
saw 

the genocide of Indigenous 
people 
in 
this 
country 

and 
the 
exploitation 
and 

dehumanization of Africans. 
However, 
democracy 
allows 

us to use our leverage and our 
collective voice to reduce some 
of the harm that has happened 
in our communities. If Black 
people were not voting in this 
country, we would not have a 
democracy.” 

Brown also commented on a 

more recent event: the Jan. 6 
Capitol riot. Brown said current 
economic 
uncertainties, 
as 

well as blatant racism and 
scapegoating, contributed to 
the attempted insurrection.

“There 
are 
some 
larger 

structural 
issues 
that 
are 

driving the frustration that 
is rooted in the current state 
of the country and economy,” 
said Brown. “However, Black 
people and immigrants are 
consistently 
the 
scapegoat 

and receive most of the blame. 
There is an expectation that 
America is supposed to serve 
the interest of white comfort. 
So 
when 
there 
is 
white 

discomfort, there has been 
a history of society blaming 
people of color.” 

LSA senior Josiah Walker, 

vice president of LSA student 
government, 
asked 
Brown 

about the influence that Black 
college students have on the 
future of democracy. Brown 
responded by posing a question 
of her own: “What would 

America 
look 
like 
without 

racism?”

 “98% of people cannot see 

anything 
when 
doing 
this 

exercise,” said Brown. “Spend 
more time radically envisioning 
what this world can be. There 
is nothing that has ever been 
brought into being that was 
not first envisioned. We can 
radically 
reimagine 
every 

system as founders of a new 
America. Spend more time 
not just reacting to what is 

happening around us, but to 
reimagine how we can better 
our world.” 

This exercise was powerful 

and 
eye-opening 
for 
many 

attendees, 
including 
Music, 

Theatre & Dance associate 
professor Antonio C. Cuyler, 
who moderated the event.

“I’ve 
heard 
of 
this 

experiment before and I’ve 
been thinking about it more,” 
Cuyler said. “If we remove 
racism, if we remove sexism, 
if we remove all forms of 
oppression currently in our 
society, what would that look 
like? And the answer I came 
up with is a more prosperous 
society, a society that allows all 
of us to prosper unencumbered 
by these artificial differences 
that we placed too much value 
in.” 

Walker said he wanted to see 

the University raise awareness 
of Black history during all 
months of the year. 

 “Black people still exist 

outside the month of February,” 
Walker said. “I want to see the 
University continue to promote 
Black 
history 
further 
and 

highlight 
the 
contributions 

that the Black community has 
made 
in 
American 
society 

throughout history and today.” 

Chief 
Diversity 
Officer 

Robert Sellers spoke on the 
panel and echoed Walker’s 
sentiments, urging the audience 
to celebrate Black history and 
recognize 
the 
contributions 

Black people have made to the 
country.

“You 
can’t 
understand 

American 
history 
without 

understanding 
African-

American history,” Sellers said. 
“I would like for everybody — 
regardless of race and cultural 
background — to have a better 
understanding 
of 
the 
role 

of African Americans in the 
world.” 

Williams said he wished 

the University would spend 
more time and resources to 
events supporting the Black 
community on campus.

“I think having consistent 

programming 
that 

acknowledges Black students 
on 
campus 
is 
important,” 

Williams said. “Members of 
my Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity 
Inc., Epsilon Chapter in the 
past were really influential in 
starting organizations such as 
the Black Student Union and 
things of that nature. So, I 
think that it’s important that 
the University acknowledges 
the work that Black students 
do because part of the Black 
experience on campus is not 

just the hardships of being 
the only person of color in the 
classroom. It’s the fun things 
too — it’s the things that we do 
to constantly uplift students on 
a day-to-day basis.”

Public 
Policy 
senior 

Cydney Gardner-Brown, also 
a 
panelist, 
encouraged 
the 

University to pay students who 
speak on panels and offer their 
knowledge to the University 
community.

“It seems that the University 

recognizes the importance of 
having student panelists and 
having the voice of student 
activists on their panels, but 
they don’t see the necessity of 
making sure those students feel 
compensated for their work,” 
Gardner-Brown said. “A lot of 
the work that student activists 
do are things that people in the 
workforce get paid to do.”

Throughout the event, Brown 

urged attendees to advance 
humanity in a direction where 
equality reverberates through 
every community. According 
to 
Brown, 
commitment 

and perseverance form the 
foundation 
of 
successful 

movements. She encouraged 
the audience to welcome the 
tension 
and 
pressure 
that 

accompanies producing radical 
change.

“Pressure 
either 
destroys 

you or stimulates you,” Brown 
said. “You have to radically 
recreate what you want to 
see. 
Every 
generation 
has 

something to offer. Tension is 
normal. As long as you have 
mutual respect, change can 
happen.”

Students of Color Liberation Front releases 
anti-racist demands for U-M administration
Coalition of racial/ethnic justice organizations calls on University to increase funding, decolonize curricula and more

CAMPUS LIFE

CAMPUS LIFE

JANICE KANG
Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan’s 

Students of Color Liberation Front 
— a coalition of racial/ethnic 
justice organizations — released 
a 15-page document of demands 
Monday calling on the University 
to take concrete steps to address 
and dismantle racism on campus. 
Almost 100 community members 
have signed in support of the 
statement by time of publication.

The SoC LF is made up of the 

Black Student Union, United Asian 
American Organizations, La Casa, 
Arab Student Association, Native 
American Student Association, 
the 
Student 
Community 
of 

Progressive Empowerment and 
Students Allied for Freedom and 
Education. 

The demands cover a wide range 

of issues, some new and many 
longtime demands from each of 
these organizations. The goal of 
these demands is to improve the 
experiences of students, faculty 
and staff of color on campus while 
positively impacting the entire 
U-M community, the statement 
said.

Some of the demands call 

on the University to support 
the leadership of racial justice 
organizations 
on 
campus 
in 

their work. This includes the 
Office of Student Life giving each 
organization $1,500 in funding 
starting this semester, as well 
as 
offering 
other 
sustainable 

funding 
models 
particularly 

for Arab Student Association. 
The statement also asks that 
student leaders from SoC LF 
member organizations be able 
to 
recommend 
candidates 
to 

fill 
administrative 
positions, 

particularly those that impact 
students of color on campus.

Some of the demands pertain to 

academics at the University: they 
ask the University to decolonize its 
curriculums, echoing sentiments 
from 
last 
semester’s 
United 

Statement; reassess the Race 
and Ethnicity requirement; and 
provide more support for faculty 
of color.

One category of demands are 

increasing staff for students of 
color in key support areas, such 
as Counseling and Psychological 
Services — particularly for 
Indigenous, 
LGBTQ+ 
and/or 

undocumented students — as well 
as at the Spectrum Center. 

Other demands ask for making 

Indigenous People’s Day a U-M 
holiday, abolishing the Office 
of 
Enrollment 
Management’s 

40-day clause for in-state tuition 
and 
disaggregating 
Asian/

Pacific Islander American data 
for climate surveys. The latter 
two have been long-time asks 
of 
SCOPE, 
the 
organization 

advocating 
for 
undocumented 

students on campus, and AAPI 
groups, respectively. Additionally, 
the demands include mandating 
that 
Student 
Legal 
Services 

provide 
training 
for 
Arab/

Palestine student activists and 
that the University commit to 
transparency 
regarding 
secret 

societies’ access to administrative 
resources, among many other 
asks. 

LSA 
junior 
Rebeca 
Yanes, 

external director of La Casa, 
wrote in an email to The Michigan 
Daily that these demands are 
empowering 
because 
they 

encourage students of color to 
actively participate in discussions 
about anti-racism.

“The 
Students 
of 
Color 

Liberation 
Front, 
along 
with 

the 
collective 
leadership 
and 

membership of the organizations 
that make it up, should be regarded 
as stakeholders in conversations 
about anti-racism on campus,” 

Yanes wrote. “I believe that 
University 
leadership 
should 

equally and meaningfully consult 
all the demands if they seek to 
create a truly anti-racist campus.” 

Yanes also wrote that the 

power of these demands lies in the 
collective action of these different 
organizations to make campus 
better for all students. 

“As the Students of Color 

Liberation Front, we are a united 
front, equally invested in the 
empowerment of each other’s 
communities and demands for 
University 
leadership,” 
Yanes 

wrote. “Each demand is made as 
equally valuable and significant in 
the University’s work that impacts 
students of color.”

Policing demands

The executive board of Students 

Allied for Freedom and Equality 
wrote in a statement to The Daily 
that SoC LF is a platform for people 
of color to collectively address 
racism at the University, especially 
after members of the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization, faculty 
and 
undergraduate 
students 

called for demilitarization and 
diversion of funds from local and 
campus police during their strike 
last semester. 

The demands include that the 

University cut all ties with the 
U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement and the Ann Arbor 
Police Department, commit to 
investigating alternatives to police 
intervention and reexamine how 
the University currently utilizes 
alternative methods to policing. 
The statement writes that these 
demands are non-negotiable. 

“Accordingly, 
these 
action 

items will cultivate a safe campus 
climate for all students,” the 
demands read. “Especially Black 
and Brown students who are 
disproportionately placed at risk 
when the University relies heavily 

on police presence on campus.” 

These demands followed a 

summer of protests to end police 
brutality. In response to GEO’s 
anti-policing 
demands, 
the 

University created the U-M task 
force on public safety to evaluate 
the operations of the Division 
of Public Safety and Security 
and recommend improvements, 
though a member of the task force 
told The Daily the group is set on 
police reform. 

The demilitarization demands 

also arose out of the University’s 
choice to introduce — and soon 
after repeal — the controversial 
Michigan Ambassadors program, 
which had armed police officers 
walking 
around 
campus 
to 

monitor student behavior during 
the pandemic. Many cultural 
associations said they were not 
consulted about the creation of the 
Michigan Ambassadors program.

“SoC LF is a coalition space 

made up of various racial justice 
organizations 
that 
have 
had 

existing relationships, but our 
organizations 
came 
together 

under this name in response to the 
University’s decisions regarding 
policing last semester, and the 
lack of consultation with our 
organizations,” 
the 
statement 

reads. “In response, our coalition 
banded together to resist shallow 
consultation of students of color, 
and over the course of the last few 
months, developed these demands 
for this anti-racist vision.” 

Outreach to prospective 

students of color

The demands also call on the 

University to restructure outreach 
initiatives to underrepresented 
students 
of 
color. 
In 
their 

statement, SoC LF said this is a 
necessary step toward creating an 
equitable campus. 

The steps for achieving this 

include increasing the population 

of 
staff 
who 
can 
speak 
to 

experiences of students of color 
in the Office of Financial Aid, 
meeting the 10% Black student 
enrollment 
benchmark 
as 

originally demanded by the Black 
Action Movement and hiring full-
time staff members who are well-
versed in experiences of people 
of color to coordinate the 2006 
Proposal 2 adherent recruitment 
strategies. 

It also asks the University to 

recommit 
the 
Comprehensive 

Studies Program to its original 
purpose of serving Black students 
and giving “students — primarily 
in-state 
minority 
students 

from 
inner-city 
high 
schools 

— an opportunity to attend the 
University of Michigan during 
the summer to achieve a solid 
academic foundation for success 
in the fall term.” Other programs 
meant for Black students, like the 
Bridge Scholars Program, has also 
seen a decrease in Black student 
enrollment.

“The University of Michigan 

must commit to an extensive 
restructuring 
of 
outreach 

and 
recruitment 
methods 
in 

enrollment 
management 
and 

outreach offices,” the demands 
read. 

The 
University 
previously 

offered the Provost Award, which 
fully met out-of-state students’ 
demonstrated needs who typically 
had expected family contribution 
below approximately $11,000. Last 
year, the award was discontinued 
and the Victors Award was 
introduced, which includes a 
merit component and provides a 
flat $8,000 per year. The award is 
given in addition to other aid for 
which a student might qualify for. 

Last month, after seeing a drop 

in Latinx enrollment, La Casa 
released a statement opposing 
the 
discontinuation 
of 
the 

Provost Award. According to the 

statement, the reduced financial 
aid packages did not provide 
sufficient support for out-of-state 
Latinx students who were unable 
to afford University tuition. The 
University has countered that the 
drop in Latinx enrollment could 
be due to the pandemic, but La 
Casa maintains that it believes the 
end of the Provost’s Award also 
played a factor. 

“The policy sends a concerning 

message to the Latinx community 
and 
prospective 
out-of-state 

students who experience financial 
hardship that the University of 
Michigan is not accessible,” the 
statement reads. 

Climate demands

SoC LF also asks that the 

University reassess its relationship 
with the fossil fuel industry and 
divest from companies that violate 
the rights of Palestinians in order 
to demonstrate a commitment 
to sustainable, ethical and moral 
spending. 

In December, the President’s 

Commission on Carbon Neutrality 
— created after sustained student 
activism — released its draft 
recommendations 
to 
reduce 

greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 

associated with the University. 
However, activists — particularly 
those involved with the Climate 
Action 
Movement 
— 
have 

criticized the PCCN for not 
including divestment from fossil 
fuel industries under the scope of 
its work.

“Rather 
than 
be 
purely 

profit-driven, 
the 
University’s 

investments must be built upon 
ethical and moral considerations 
for sustainable investment,” SoC 
LF’s list of demands reads.

Study shows Black researchers about 55% less 
likely to receive NIH funding than white peers

RESEARCH

University 
of 
Michigan 

biomedical 
engineering 

professor 
Omolola 
Eniola-

Adefeso, 
along 
with 
19 

other women in biomedical 
engineering across the country, 
published a paper last month 
calling for an end to racial 
disparity in funding by the 
National Institute of Health.

According to the paper, the 

probability of Black principal 
investigators 
receiving 
a 

research 
award 
was 
about 

55% 
of 
the 
probability 
of 

white principal investigators 
receiving one in 2000-2006. 
In 
2014-2016, 
this 
number 

remained the same.

“We, 
as 
scientists 
and 

engineers, 
wrote 
editorials 

and promised to do better,” the 
paper reads. “Yet, over a decade 

later, this gap persists.”

According to Eniola-Adefeso, 

equitable research grants from 
the NIH are necessary for 
ensuring diversity in biomedical 
engineering 
research 
and 

enabling 
researchers 
to 

acquire 
promotions 
and 

tenured positions. She told The 
Michigan Daily funding diverse 
research 
teams 
motivates 

students from all backgrounds 
to pursue research.

“We 
recognize 
that 
part 

of the problem is that (NIH 
funded 
researchers), 
as 
a 

body, are not diverse,” Eniola-
Adefeso said. “We are primarily 
responsible for training the U.S. 
workforce, and if we are not 
training a diverse workforce, 
we are leaving people out from 
accessing high-paying jobs.”

The 
paper 
highlighted 

several ways funding agencies 
could work towards eliminating 
disparities in grants awarded. 

These 
include 
officially 

acknowledging the prevalence 
of racism in academia and 
committing to work towards its 
expulsion, instituting policies 
that 
will 
enable 
equitable 

funding for Black researchers 
and 
prioritizing 
diverse 

research teams for funding. 

Numerous studies cited in 

the paper show diverse research 
teams 
generate 
the 
most 

creative and impactful ideas 
and solutions. Eniola-Adefeso 
said the NIH should create a 
diversity score that measures 
the 
diversity 
of 
research 

teams and enables teams with 
higher scores to be prioritized 
for 
funding, 
encouraging 

diversification and innovation.

“Diversity of people, diversity 

of 
background, 
diversity 
of 

life experiences — if those are 
important in getting innovative 
solutions, then why is it that the 
NIH grant scoring process does 

not give points to the diversity 
of the research team?” Eniola-
Adefeso said.

Korie 
Grayson, 
an 

engineering postdoctoral fellow 
in Eniola-Adefeso’s lab, said it 
is essential to identify the core 
issues in the research funding 
process to ensure it can be 
successfully eliminated, as the 
paper does. 

Grayson said the disparity 

in 
research 
funding 
is 

unsurprising 
since 
women 

of 
color 
pursuing 
research 

have to combat unwelcome 
environments and numerous 
gender and racial biases and 
stereotypes while working in 
the field.

“Being 
half 
as 
likely 
to 

be 
funded 
as 
your 
white 

counterpart who is basically 
on the same level as you is 
discouraging,” Grayson said. 
“It is discouraging but it is 
not surprising, which is the 

sad part. In order to have 
more young scientists of color, 
specifically Black women, there 
has to be a change.”

The Biomedical Engineering 

Society, a student organization 
promoting 
networking 

and research panels in the 
biomedical engineering field at 
the University, agreed with the 
paper’s findings. In an email to 
The Daily, Engineering senior 
Likitha Nimmagadda, president 
of the Biomedical Engineering 
Society, 
emphasized 
the 

organization’s 
support 
for 

the need to ensure equitable 
research grants awarded by the 
NIH.

“The BMES chapter at U of 

M fully supports and agrees 
with the sentiments expressed 
by the authors of the ‘Fund 
Black scientists’ commentary 
published in Cell,” Nimmagadda 
wrote. “Black scientists must be 
funded at the same rate as white 

scientists and improving this 
racial funding disparity must be 
prioritized. In order to improve 
equity 
in 
funding 
received 

by researchers, we must ‘see 
color’.” 

Eniola-Adefeso also said the 

conception of the paper was 
spurred by the death of George 
Floyd, a Black man who was 
killed on May 25 by police. 
She said the murder prompted 
biomedical engineering faculty 
members to discuss and work 
to combat racial inequities 
existing in the research field.

“We can no longer allow this 

to go under the radar,” Eniola-
Adefeso said. “We have a voice 
as faculty and we felt like this 
was a time to reengage the NIH 
in this conversation.”

Report by U-M professor calls for end to racial disparities in government research spending

NAVYA GUPTA
Daily Staff Reporter

In his book “When Germs 

Travel,” Markel makes the case 
for a globally funded public 
health program. 

Markel 
said 
the 
World 

Health Organization has a very 
small staff and must be invited 
into a country because it has no 
“police powers.”

“The main thesis of (the 

book) 
is 
that 
germs 
don’t 

respect borders,” Markel said. 
“There’s no sovereignty to an 
epidemic — they travel. An 
outbreak anywhere can easily 
go everywhere, as we found 
out.” 

Markel 
is 
especially 

interested in the weaponization 
of epidemics against immigrant 
and migrant groups. Markel, 
who worked at an AIDS clinic 
as a graduate student at Johns 
Hopkins University and at an 
immigrant hostel in Detroit, 
said this interest stemmed 
from his Eastern European 

Jewish heritage. 

Markel learned from his 

grandparents — who raised 
him in a bilingual household 
speaking Yiddish — that the 
typhus 
fever 
and 
cholera 

epidemics had been blamed 
on Eastern European Jewish 
immigrants in New York City 
at the turn of the century.

“I wanted to delve into the 

Yiddish press and sources to 
see how they experienced it, in 
comparison to how the Anglo-
American or white American 
press encountered it,” Markel 
said. “Of course, they knew 
what was going on. They knew 
enough science and they knew 
they were being corralled.”

Markel said the “uses and 

misuses 
of 
public 
health 

measures as social means” 
contributed 
to 
staggering 

misconceptions about patients 
affected by the AIDS epidemic. 
While working at the AIDS 
clinic, 
Markel 
said 
many 

patients who were gay or used 
intravenous drugs asked him if 
they’d be quarantined.

“First, I said, ‘Well, no, 

it’s not the right disease, it’s 
sexually transmitted and that 
wouldn’t be the way to do 
it,’” Markel said. “But, I kept 
hearing this question and as a 
doctor, you don’t hear the same 

social question over and over 
again. You hear, like, ‘Will it 
hurt? How much does it cost?’ 
Or, ‘What are the side effects?’ 
But you don’t hear that.” 

Markel said the realization 

that the political manipulation 
of quarantine was used as 
an excuse to isolate already 
stigmatized 
or 
scapegoated 

populations struck him “like a 
lightning bolt.”

He also said his patients were 

painfully aware of this trend. 
To these patients, the word 
quarantine 
was 
not 
simply 

code for a public health policy, 

but rather a metaphor for the 
increasing stigmatization and 
isolation that resulted from 
their illness.

In his book “Quarantine,” 

Markel 
said 
his 
historical 

research and clinical practices 
are similar because they both 
require him to use primary 
sources to arrive at a diagnosis.

Markel said he feels an 

obligation to bring attention 
to marginalized communities, 
referencing 
his 
work 
with 

individuals who have AIDS. 

“(I have a) responsibility 

to 
bear 
witness 
and 
tell 

the stories (of scapegoated 
groups),” Markel said. “What 
I was inspired to do, based on 
what I saw in my clinic with 
AIDS patients, was to dig as 
deeply as I could.”

Markel 
said 
even 
while 

taking on various roles — such 
as medical historian, physician 
or writer — he never forgets 
the Hippocratic oath he took to 
protect and serve his patients. 
Though he said he has been 
accused of holding partisan 

opinions after writing about 
strategies for containing the 
virus, Markel said he cannot 
endorse viewpoints that do not 
protect his patients’ lives.

“I’m a pediatrician, and I 

take care of kids,” Markel said. 
“I’m pretty sure that if I told 
people I wouldn’t do everything 
in my power to preserve lives, 
no one would want me as their 
doctor.” 

When 
asked 
about 
what 

kind of work he will do for the 
remainder of the pandemic, 
Markel emphasized his range 
of expertise. 

“I’m a medical historian, 

and so I don’t pretend to know 
anything about how to predict 
the future,” Markel said. “But 
what we do know from history 
is what works, so I can say with 
confidence that we know social 
distancing and flattening the 
curve works.”

The University’s Office of 

Public Affairs declined to 
comment on Weiser’s emails.

Weiser, incoming co-chair 

of the Michigan Republican 
Party, faced criticism from 
some 
in 
the 
University 

community after the Jan. 6 
Capitol riot. More than 150 
U-M professors signed onto 
a request that Weiser resign, 
arguing 
that 
attempts 
by 

members of the Michigan 
GOP to overturn the 2020 
presidential 
election 
by 

perpetuating lies about voter 
fraud make his role as regent 
and head of the state party 
incompatible. 

“These events are not an 

aberration but the inevitable 
end result of positions the 
MI-GOP has openly endorsed 
or tacitly tolerated, with your 
consent and support,” the 
request reads. “As Trump’s 
Michigan 
campaign 
chair, 

you directly contributed to 
the rise of a politician who, 
as President of the United 
States, incited a mob to storm 
the nation’s Capitol with the 
express aim of preventing the 
certification of a democratic 
election.”

Weiser 
has 
repeatedly 

condemned the violence at 
the Capitol and said it is time 
for Republicans to move on 
from the 2020 election. His 
incoming co-chair, Meshawn 
Maddock, 
organized 
buses 

of Michigan supporters of 
former 
President 
Donald 

Trump to Washington, D.C., 
for the Jan. 6 “stop the steal” 
rally that turned into an 
insurrection.

Maddock 
retweeted 
a 

video of Trump supporters 
marching to the Capitol that 
afternoon with the caption: 
“The most incredible crowd 
and sea of people I’ve ever 
walked with (heart emoji).” 

Weiser 
told 
Bridge 

Michigan 
on 
Jan. 
7 
that 

Maddock did not incite the 
riot. He said he did not know 
if Trump bore any blame.

“I didn’t read any of that 

stuff, and I didn’t watch 
television,” 
Weiser 
told 

Bridge. “I watched Michigan 
destroy 
Minnesota 
in 

basketball, and that kind of 
contest is something that I 
strongly support.”

Weiser has not mentioned 

Trump or anyone else as 
holding responsibility in his 
statements. 

“To move forward as a 

party, we must acknowledge 
our mistakes and never let 
them happen again,” Weiser 
tweeted on Jan. 9. “Let me 
be clear, the events in our 
nation’s Capital this week 
were both incredibly tragic 
and 
wrong. 
People 
were 

misled. And that resulted in 
death and destruction. That is 
unacceptable and abhorrent.”

Weiser did not respond 

to a request to comment for 
this story. Regents Katherine 
White (D), Michael Behm 
(D), Denise Ilitch (D), Mark 
Bernstein (D) did not respond 
to 
requests 
for 
comment. 

Regents Jordan Acker (D) and 
Sarah Hubbard (R) declined to 
comment. Regent Paul Brown 
(D) 
declined 
to 
comment 

on specific emails, but said 
Weiser is an “exceptional” 
regent.

“Although 
our 
political 

views differ greatly, I know 
that he always has the best 
interest 
of 
the 
University 

at heart,” Brown wrote. “I 
would also hope that we 
live in a world that would 
excuse me, or anyone else, 
who inadvertently sends a 
personal email. Additionally, 
I know the board has actual 
important things to worry 
about.”

“Since 
the 
(stay 
in 
place 

recommendation) 
I’ve 
gotten 

(takeout) and that’s it,” Dirkman 
said. “But I think that I will go to 
restaurants more (once the order 
ends).” 

In contrast, LSA freshman 

Annie Cress has ruled out going 
to a restaurant for indoor dining 
regardless of the stay in place 
recommendation and said she has 
reservations about whether or not 
restaurants would actually be able 
to stop the spread.

“I don’t feel 100% comfortable, 

it really depends on what the 
restaurants are doing with their 

(safety) guidelines,” Cress said. 
“But I do get takeout to support 
local businesses.”

Adam Baru, owner of Isalita 

and Mani Osteria, said that with 
the current situation, he doesn’t 
feel 
comfortable 
opening 
his 

restaurant to indoor dining. Baru, 
whose restaurant is fairly reliant 
on student life, said there is a 
certain experience one gets when 
coming to his restaurant. If all 
of his guests and employees are 
not entirely comfortable at his 
restaurant, then he is not going to 
open.

“Opening 
and 
closing 
and 

opening and closing is really hard 
on a restaurant,” Baru said. “I’d 
rather wait until we’re out of the 
woods to be at the point where 

scales tip in favor of safety instead 
of being open because we want or 
need to be open.” 

Baru also acknowledged his 

business was privileged enough 
to not have to worry about 
finances, as he is certain they will 
survive until the vaccine is widely 
available.

The 
University’s 
plans 
for 

Winter 2021 influenced some 
business owners’ decision on 
whether or not to resume indoor 
dining. The plans, which were 
announced in an email from 
University 
President 
Schlissel 

on Nov. 6, consisted of the 
vast majority of classes being 
conducted online and reduced 
occupancy in U-M residence halls.

Jared Hoffman, owner of Salads 

UP on E. Liberty St., estimated 
that students made up almost 70% 
of his clientele, and not having 
them on campus was a factor in 
his decision to transition away 
from a sit-down establishment 
and towards a grab-and-go style 
restaurant.

“Ann Arbor, we’re really a 

college town,” Hoffman said. 
“The campus was built here for 
student life and the students 
really 
drive 
business 
traffic. 

I 
totally 
understand 
(the 

University’s decision), but when 
you lose X amount of students, 
the whole economy and the town 
is affected.”

Arlo Parks Explores Light and Loss on ‘Collapsed in Sunbeams’

If you’ve ever dug up an old diary 

and leafed through its pages, it’s 
very likely you’ve stumbled upon 
some 
melodramatic 
vignettes 

of 
adolescence, 
both 
cringe-

worthy to read yet strangely 
impossible to tear your eyes away 
from. There’s a certain appeal 
to re-living the most intimate 
moments of your life through 
the gel-penned scribbles of your 
younger self. London indie-pop 
singer Arlo Park’s newest project, 
Collapsed in Sunbeams, sounds 
like a cinematic reimagining of 
that high school diary — sans the 
pubescent theatrics. 

The 20-year-old’s debut album, 

following a steady release of 
singles and collaborations with 
the likes of Phoebe Bridgers and 
Clairo, takes on both the gritty 
and lighthearted experiences that 
come with navigating friendship 
and love as a young adult. Across 
12 tracks, seven lo-fi covers and 
one poem track, Parks paints 

a picture book of solace and 
isolation. In an interview with 
The New York Times, she shared, 
“I find it harder to write about joy 
because it’s simpler. There’s more 
complexity in sad things. But I’m a 
defiant optimist.” On Collapsed in 
Sunbeams, these quiet moments 
of joy and sadness intermix to 
create a deeply personal bedroom 
pop album perfect for the new 
year. 

Parks 
first 
broke 
out 
of 

anonymity 
with 
her 
2018 

single 
“Cola.” 
The 
stripped-

back track, crafted in under 20 
minutes by Parks and producer 
Luca Buccellati, chronicles the 
breaking point of a relationship 
filled with infidelity, earning over 
15 million streams on Spotify since 
its initial release. Parks solidified 
her knack for storytelling and 
vivid imagery on “Cola,” a skill 
she’s maintained and grown on 
Collapsed in Sunbeams. 

Citing a line from Zadie Smith’s 

“On Beauty” as inspiration for 
the album title, Parks has found 
her vision in a wide variety of 
sources, including Studio Ghibli 

films, Frank Ocean and her own 
journal from when she was 13. It’s 
easy to see these connections on 
the project, with its kaleidoscope 
of visuals and intimate pockets of 
teenagehood. 

On the song “Black Dog,” Parks 

approaches depression and the 
loss of a friend by suicide with 
emotive 
sincerity. 
She 
sings, 

“Let’s go to the corner store 
and buy some fruit / I would do 
anything to get you out your room 
/ Just take your medicine and eat 
some food / It’s so cruel what your 
mind can do for no reason.” Set 
against plucky guitar and a simple 
beat, Parks’s gentle vocals soften 
the song’s tragic words. 

Airy and glowing like the 

sunbeams 
of 
the 
album’s 

namesake, Parks’s voice carries 
the listener to another trial on 
the dreamy pop track “Green 
Eyes.” Here, she details the loss 
of a relationship plagued by 
unaccepting parents and sheltered 
sexuality, 
with 
songwriting 

credits and background vocals 
from Clairo. 

Parks, who is openly bisexual, 

sings, “Of course I know why we 
lasted two months / Could not 
hold my hand in public / Felt their 
eyes judging our love and baying 
for blood.” Its breezy and warm 
instrumentation are meant to 
“uplift and comfort those going 
through hard times,” according 
to Parks. Her ability to find the 
sunny undersides of even the 
darkest struggles shines, a key 
element that prevents Collapsed 
in Sunbeams from feeling too 
heavy to enjoy. 

The 
sleepy 
and 
beautiful 

“Eugene,” which found its way 
onto one of Michelle Obama’s 
summer playlists last August, 
narrates the sting of falling for 
your best friend who falls for 
someone else. Parks reflects, 
“Hey, I know I’ve been a little bit 
off and that’s my mistake / I kind 
of fell half in love and you’re to 
blame / I guess I just forgot that 
we’ve been mates since day.” 

It’s both a highly personal 

narrative and yet something 
anyone 
can 
find 
resonant. 

Maybe we’ve all had our own 
version of “Eugene,” someone 

who disrupts something good 
and leaves us feeling detached 
from the familiar. With tucked 
in spoken-word pieces like the 
titular “Collapsed in Sunbeams” 
and “Black Dog Poem,” Parks 
further immerses the listener 
in her stories and provides a 
kind of intimacy and specificity 
sometimes 
missing 
from 

mainstream bedroom pop. 

Parks has grown since “Cola,” 

still serving snapshots of inner 
turmoil 
and 
love 
but 
with 

matured sound and production. 
The tracks “Too Good” and 

“Portra 
400,” 
which 
Paul 

Epworth (Adele, Florence + the 
Machine) 
produced, 
evoking 

the coming-of-age, end credit 
vibrance Parks says she dreamed 
of in an interview with Apple 
Music. 

She’s no longer a 17-year-

old making beats in a nameless 
London flat, but Parks’s music 
today is no less disarmingly 
sincere. Collapsed in Sunbeams 
is a melancholic journey through 
youth, promising a bright future 
of storytelling and vulnerability 
for Parks.

‘The Divines’ offers a razor-

sharp exploration of adolescence 

and class divides

Welcome to St. John the Divine, 

an English boarding school for 
girls where students (nicknamed 
the Divines) keep secrets, form 
alliances and vie for popularity. 
There are several things that make 
a Divine: the coy hair flip, the blasé 
use of French, the haughty walk, 
the mysterious nicknames. To be 
one of the Divines is to embody 
something intangible, a result of 
the social molding that takes place 
in every girl that enters the school’s 
hallowed halls. But what goes on 
behind the smiles and façades? 

In Ellie Eaton’s razor-sharp new 

novel, “The Divines,” Josephine, 
a former student at St. John the 
Divine, revisits the grounds of 
her old school and reflects on 
her haunted past. In her last year 
at boarding school, a scandal 
rocked the Divines that torments 
Josephine well into her adult 
life. Under her husband’s gentle 
prompting, Josephine faces her 
complicated past and realizes 
that, despite the distance she put 
between herself and her old school, 

she can never fully escape its legacy. 

The world of the Divines is 

equally compelling and twisted; 
they exude a kind of ethereal 
energy that is intoxicating to read 
about. Eaton makes sweeping 
claims 
about 
her 
characters, 

saying, “Divines were committed 
oversharers by nature,” “together 
Divines were indomitable” and 
“Divines could sleep anywhere,” 
giving the reader a sense of the 
exclusive and cult-like nature of the 
novel. 

At the same time, the petty 

grievances, 
social 
struggles, 

references to sexual misconduct 
and class biases reveal an uglier 
side to the world of the Divines. 
The fact of the matter is the girls of 
the Divine are snobby and entitled, 
calling the residents of a nearby 
village ‘townies’ and flaunting their 
privilege and money. Josephine 
seems 
to 
disapprove 
of 
this 

behavior, but is equally complicit. 

In this way, the novel perfectly 

captures the pain of adolescence, 
making sharp observations about 
social dynamics and the cruelty of 
youth. Little interactions between 
the girls felt momentous: Fleeting 
looks, cold shoulders and insincere 

smiles 
become 
agonizingly 

significant. “The Divines” painfully 
reminded me of my angsty teenage 
years, evoking the same raw and 
gritty feelings. 

The story unfolds at a perfectly 

measured 
pace. 
As 
Josephine 

reflects on her past as a Divine, little 
by little, details of her time at the 
boarding school reveal themselves. 
For the reader, there is a sense of 
foreboding. Something bad is going 
to happen and you can feel it. 

The prologue gives a little taste 

of the scandal that occurs, leaving 
the reader hooked, needing to know 
what happens. I spent the rest of 
the novel breathlessly awaiting the 
big reveal, feeling the tension in the 
novel coil tight like a spring. Eaton 
writes with a nuance and masterful 
grasp of social interplay that feels 
reminiscent of Kazuo Ishiguro’s 
“Never Let Me Go.” 

As 
a 
teenager, 
Josephine 

is 
angsty, 
self-conscious 
and 

compliant. She is tormented with 
thoughts of whether she is liked, 
where she falls on the social ladder 
at school and how she can appear 
cool. On the other hand, her adult 
self is happily married and self-
sufficient. One thing I struggled 

with while reading “The Divines” 
was this gaping disconnect between 
Josephine’s past and present selves; 
how did this insecure, awkward 
teenager become a functioning 
adult? I don’t doubt that this kind 
of transformation is possible (I 
can only hope that I’ve changed a 
lot from my high school self), but 
the book offers no insight into how 
Josephine turned out so different 
as an adult. 

Were her teenage insecurities 

purely run-of-the-mill adolescent 
angst, something she grew out 
of with age? This question isn’t 
really answered in the novel, and 
I was left struggling to bridge 
the gap between younger and 

older Josephine. I did, however, 
enjoy seeing how Jospehine’s past 
affected her as an adult. Though 
somewhat disjointed, the paralleled 
storylines serve their intended 
purpose, adding to the suspense 
and allowing us to see the legacy of 
Josephine’s past as a Divine.

Because 
of 
the 
slow 
and 

deliberate development of the 
novel, it took me a while to 
get into it, but when I did, boy, 
was I hooked. “The Divines” 
is a provocative coming of age 
story, rich with explorations 
of class divides, secrets, sexual 
awakenings 
and 
adolescent 

insecurities. I will admit I began 
reading knowing nothing about 

the novel or author, but was left 
haunted by the story for days after 
I finished and keenly interested 
in what Ellie Eaton might write 
next. The Divines’ school motto 
is memoir amici, (“remember 
friends”) — an ironic inclusion 
considering 
Josephine 
spends 

most of her adult life trying to 
escape her past as a Divine. 

And yet, in the end, she is 

unable to. She is just as haunted by 
childhood friendships, secrets and 
the trauma of her past well into 
adulthood. “The Divines” brought 
me back to my own adolescence, 
and the experience felt just as 
exciting, awkward, uncomfortable 
and thrilling as I remember it.

Velveteen Dreams: Serge Lutens, an Olfactory Odyssey, Pt. Two

The main thing I love about 

perfume is that it’s ridiculous. 
Every aspect of it is ridiculous. 
The very sound of the word 
“perfume,” even as I hear it in 
my head, makes my skin crawl, 
and it’s exhilarating. I love the 
saccharine, schmaltzy snips of 
copy generously classified as 
descriptions. I love how everyone 
involved in the marketing of 
it has collectively come to the 
conclusion that the less sense you 
make, the better. 

Full abstraction. I don’t know 

how an advert featuring Nicole 
Kidman running around taxis in 
Times Square, looking completely 

bewildered in a $20,000 gown, 
translates into a concrete sales 
figure, but you know what? I’ll let 
one of the business majors figure 
it out; that’s not my problem.

The business of fragrance is 

built on artifice. Fragrance itself 
is about as detached as a creative 
medium can get from reality — 
the best roses are composed of 
no discernible rose, chemical 
compounds 
that 
give 
musk 

its “sex” factor are naturally 
occurring signs of decay and an 
entire scent category (the fougère) 
was inspired by an odorless plant. 

Yet, smell is the sense most 

closely 
linked 
to 
emotion 

and memory, and the skilled 
deployment 
of 
scent 
can 

communicate 
things 
that 

lie beyond words, logic and 

rationalization. 
Few 
perfume 

houses have been able to marry 
creative vision and emotion while 
wielding the inherent silliness 
of the industry, and the house of 
Serge Lutens is one of them. 

Serge 
Lutens, 
the 
former 

art director of Shiseido and 
pioneering figurehead of his 
eponymous label, is an intensely 
private man. Despite his fame, 
he almost never gives interviews. 
Outside 
of 
his 
profile 
on 

Kafkaesque, there is little to be 
found concretely about his early 
life, let alone his swift entree into 
the fashion and beauty world of 
the 1960s. 

There are hints of his origins 

in the titles of his fragrances, 
especially more recent outputs 
like “L’Orpheline” and “Baptême 

du 
Feu” 
(French 
for 
“The 

Orphan” and “Baptism of Fire,” 
respectively) that touch on his 
tumultuous childhood. He was 
separated from his mother shortly 
after birth, because it was illegal 
for an unwed woman to give birth 
and raise a child as a single mother 
in Lutens’s French hometown. 
His experiences with familial 
rejection and abandonment — 
and their ties to a societal and 
legal system steeped in a very 
conservative 
interpretation 
of 

Catholicism — had a profound 
impact on his life and work, 
not the least of which being his 
contribution to perfumery. 

At 14, Lutens began working in 

a salon in Lille, and despite not 
wishing to work there, it would 
serve as a catalyst for his creative 
prowess to come to life. He soon 
ventured 
into 
hairdressing, 

makeup artistry, photography, 
styling and creative consulting. 
He had a penchant for feminine 
extremes and borderline-gothic 
contrasts between white, black 
and bold colors. 

His 
polaroids 
eventually 

landed him a place at French 
Vogue under Edmonde Charles-
Roux, which then opened doors 
at a number of high profile 
publications, including Elle and 
Harper’s Bazaar. He is credited 
with helping develop the first 
high fashion cosmetics line at 
Christian Dior in 1966, working at 
the house until accepting his post 
at Shiseido in the early 1980s. 

It was under Shiseido that he 

created “Nombre Noir,” a now-
infamous and highly coveted 
collector’s item, but commercial 
flop whose stock is humorously 

rumored to have been bulldozed 
by 
the 
company. 
Despite 

“Nombre 
Noir’s” 
incredibly 

high production expense and 
commercial failure, its liberal use 
of rose-tinted damascenones and 
its complicated, yet sheer chypre 
structure colored the path on 
which Lutens was headed. 

Shiseido’s 
faith 
in 
his 

ideas didn’t wane, and his 
collaboration with perfumers 
Christopher 
Sheldrake 
and 

Pierre 
Bourdon 
spawned 
a 

dark, 
yet 
minimalistic 
and 

transparent take on a cedar-
based perfume in the inimitable 
“Féminité du Bois” in 1992. 
“Féminité 
du 
Bois” 
was 
a 

sensation, taking the sheer, 
uncomplicated 
sentiment 
in 

perfumery 
represented 
by 

Bulgari’s “Eau Parfumée au 
Thé Vert” and Issey Miyake’s 
“L’eau d’Issey” and giving it an 
emotional, yet sovereign and 
unmistakably dark backbone 
with piles of dried fruits like 
peach and plum, ginger, benzoin 
and his now-signature clove. 

It may sound dramatic, but it’s 

hard to understate the influence 
of “Féminité du Bois” in modern 
perfumery. 
The 
room-filling 

ambers and chypres of the 1970s 
and ’80s had reached their 
breaking point, but the ethereal 
jingles issued as a response to 
them felt more like an apology 
than a meaningful evolution. 

The notion that you could 

either have a symphony or a wisp 
was put to rest by Serge’s second 
release under Shiseido, and it 
spawned the “Les Eaux Boisées” 
line that initially occupied his 
Palais Royal storefront. 

The aforementioned “Féminité 

du Bois,” “Bois et Musc,” “Bois et 
Fruits,” “Bois Oriental” (a name 
and 
olfactory 
category, 
now 

referred to as amber, currently 
undergoing a politically-inclined 
reconstruction), “Un bois sépia,” 
“Un bois vanille,” “Miel de bois” 
and “Bois de Violette” were 
among the house’s first releases, 
which would soon reinvent the 
modern amber, the tawdry musk 
and the soliflore with something 
new to say. 

In the house’s nearly 30 years 

of existence, Serge Lutens has 
created a number of ambers, 
florals and other fragrances 
that remain true to its brand 
of 
complicated, 
interesting, 

even “loud” offerings that veer 
from 
weighing 
themselves 

down. 
Beyond 
the 
“Bois” 

flankers, ranky, stanky fuck 
me musks like “Muscs Koublai 
Khan,” 
leathery 
florals 

like 
“Sarrasins,” 
sonorous 

soliflores like “A la nuit” and 
smoldering ambers like “La 
couche du diable” all do their 
part in populating a canon that 
simply cannot be outdone or 
diminished. 

Though the copy and the art 

direction may reach far beyond 
the threshold of camp, the heart 
of Serge Lutens continues to 
create products rooted in ideas 
that gleefully skip down to their 
scientific and artistic extremes. 
There is not a bottle that is 
phoned in, and there is not an 
accompanying 
write-up 
that 

doesn’t blast beyond the confines 
of what can be readily imagined, 
and that’s what makes this house 
so powerful.

Like 
many 
conservationists, 

Enric Sala loved our world before 
he thought about saving it. “I loved 
the natural world before I could 
understand it. In fact, I was interested 
in understanding it because I loved it,” 
Sala writes in his book, “The Nature 
of Nature: Why We Need the Wild.”

Sala is a scientist, conservationist 

and National Geographic explorer-
in-residence. Formerlyw a university 
professor who became tired of 
“writing the obituary of ocean life,” 
Sala founded National Geographic 
Pristine Seas, a project that explores 
the wildest seas on our planet to 
convince national leaders to protect 
these biodiversity hotspots. “The 
Nature of Nature” is a compilation of 
Sala’s experiences in a lengthy career 
of protecting marine areas in an effort 
to save our planet. 

“The Nature of Nature” is perfect 

for anyone who feels a pull to our 
Earth but struggles to understand its 
complexities. Sala’s goal is to give us 
a comprehensive understanding of 
ecology and the entangled relationships 
that make up our world. The initial 
chapters are a crash course in ecology: 
Readers 
learn 
about 
ecological 

succession, predator-prey relationships, 
keystone species. For those already 
familiar with ecology, the first half of 
the novel is a little dull. However, if 
ecology isn’t your forte, these chapters 
are succinct and valuable. 

But it’s worth pushing through 

these initial chapters to arrive at 
the heart of Sala’s argument. In it, 
he examines the intersection of the 
Anthropocene and the environment 
to make a compelling case to preserve 
the last wild areas on our planet for the 
benefit of all species — including us. 
There is both an economic imperative 

and moral responsibility to do so. 

A scientist by training, Sala uses 

multiple lines of argument to arrive at 
this conclusion.

***
The Historical Imperative: Our 

current attitudes toward the Earth 
are shaped by the actions of our past. 
Since the industrial era, the Western 
world has had a one-way relationship 
with the Earth — taking and giving 
little in return. “The energy we extract 
from the natural world around us 
flows in one direction: toward us and 
our built environment,” Sala writes. 
This approach is the exact opposite 
of what many indigenous groups 
around the world employ. Living in 
harmony with the Earth requires 
respect and gratitude — nurturing in 
return for taking. 

Sala powerfully shows us that 

humans are different from other 
species for one novel reason (hint: it’s 
not our superior intellect). We take 
advantage of the ancient compounded, 
dead layers of our Earth by mining 
for fossil fuels. “We use energy from 
the past to subsidize our looting of the 
present,” Sala writes. 

This approach is as unconscionable 

as it is unsustainable. Areas of the 
world that haven’t been damaged 
by extraction are more biodiverse 
with secure boundaries against the 
industrial 
world. 
Most 
zoonotic 

viruses, 
viral 
agents 
that 
are 

transmitted 
from 
a 
non-human 

animal to a human, including COVID-
19, have roots in disturbing ecosystem 
boundaries. 

The Economic Imperative: Many 

believe that countering the damage 
we’ve done to our planet would cost an 
exorbitant amount. Sala reveals that it 
does, but only in the short term. “The 
long-term benefits of restoring our 
degraded ecosystems and protecting 
the wild left on our planet far exceed 
the short-term benefits under a status 

quo that continues to destroy our 
natural world,” Sala writes.

Sala’s life-work involves convincing 

world leaders that natural areas 
are worth protecting. This means 
keeping forests free of deforestation 
and marine reserves free of fishing. 
The cost of doing so pays off in the 
long-run: Protecting marine reserves 
increases local biodiversity that spills 
over to nearby waters where fishing is 
permitted, giving fisheries an economic 
boom. Sala’s unique work gives 
readers a valuable vantage point on the 
economic benefits of conservation. 

The Moral Imperative: As a 

species on the top of the food chain, 
Sala argues humans have a moral 
responsibility to care for the Earth. 
“The planetary ethic moves humans 
away from a self-proclaimed center 
of the world and into a humble and 
respectful membership in the greater 
biosphere. It moves us from a position 
over the natural world to a place 
within it,” Sala says. This shift in 
perspective is a critical step to begin 
to care for our planet. 

Sala’s compelling message has 

been echoed by conservationists and 
indigenous groups alike. Indigenous 
peoples around the world are fighting 
to grant personhood to what the 
Western world considers “non-
living,” such as lakes, mountains 
and coral reefs. Maori tribes in New 
Zealand have succeeded in giving 
the Whanganui River the same rights 
as a person, recognizing its sacred 
character and the consequences if it’s 
polluted or destroyed. 

“It is essential for our future 

that 
humans 
experience 
that 

transcendent overview effect and 
begin to treat the biosphere like a 
living thing instead of something to 
ignore or abuse,” Sala writes.

Taubman-sponsored event 

highlights feminist architecture 

collab that reminds us why we work

Feminist thought is pervasive in 

American culture today, but rarely 
has it been considered in reference 
to the rarified field of architecture. 
Feminist architecture collaborative 
“f-architecture” 
visited 
Taubman 

College 
virtually 
on 
Tuesday 

evening to speak on how their 
practice 
challenges 
architecture’s 

historical allegiances to capital — or, 
in other words, the imperialist, white 
supremacist, capitalist patriarchy.

The presentation began in a 

digitally-rendered 
girl’s 
bedroom 

with greek columns acting as bed 
stands and a poster of Princess Nokia 
on the wall. The three women — 
Virginia Black, Gabrielle Printz and 
Rosana Elkhatib — cozied up in bed 
together, or rather, photoshopped 
together. The bedroom — a place of 
“primordial teenage rebellion” — was 
a fitting space to introduce the forces 
driving the collaborative’s practice. 
Though they were about to introduce 
projects that tackled subjects ranging 
from Native land rights in Ecuador to 
the artificial production of virginity 
in Lebanon, these politicized issues 
were inextricably personal as well.

One of their earliest projects took 

form in October 2016 at the United 
Nations Habitat III Conference in 
Quito, 
Ecuador. 
The 
conference 

worked to implement the U.N.’s 
“New Urban Agenda,” and while it 
claimed to seek representation from 
underrepresented voices in the region, 
a single booth cost $4,000 USD. For 
the Amazonian Kichwa midwives of 
AMUPAKIN, a self-organized birthing 
center providing traditional plant-
based medical care in Archidona, the 
conference was inaccessible. 

So where does design come into this? 

F-architecture submitted a publication 

to Habitat III’s “urban library” that 
considered how the U.N. could break 
from its extractionist mindset to 
incorporate “lesser known languages, 
other socialities, convivialities, semiotic 
registers, 
and 
ritual 
engagement 

with the non-human … as a basis for 
other sustainable futures and more 
sustainable pasts.”

Black then explained how they 

also fundraised to sponsor the 
members of AMUPAKIN to attend 
the conference and arranged several 
locations in Quito at which they 
could sell their wares to benefit the 
birthing center. At this point in the 
presentation, it was clear that not only 
was no one paying f-architecture, 
f-architecture was, in fact, sometimes 
paying their clients. 

So how do they practice out of 

New York City? At the start of the 
presentation, Elkhatib acknowledged 
the privileges granted to them by 
their 
degrees, 
connections 
and 

“physical ability to hustle.” Coming 
out of school at Columbia University, 
they established an “air of legitimacy” 
by renting out desk space at New 
Inc, The New Museum’s incubator 
space 
dedicated 
to 
supporting 

innovative practices in art, design and 
technology, for just $200 a month.

The last project they presented 

examined the spatial politics of 
hymen reconstructive surgery clinics 
in Beirut, Lebanon. In other words, 
they wanted to know what role the 
space of the clinics themselves played 
in reinforcing virginity culture and 
the ideal body in the country.

For 
VI 
PER 
Gallery 
in 

Prague, 
f-architecture 
physically 

reconstructed the spaces of the 
surgery clinics using observations 
collected 
from 
fieldwork 
in 

Lebanon the year prior. Presenting 
this, the three women were now 
photoshopped riding a digitally-
animated train car. A pair of hands 

entered the foreground to hold a sheet 
of paper that formed the background 
for the images of the installation they 
were about to show. 

The first image they presented 

was a photo of their reconstructed 
waiting room. Describing its effect, 
they explained that upon entering, 
you’re greeted with a womanly scent 
and a sink at which to apply some of 
the sweet odor. Lebanese Fashion TV 
plays in the background.

Then, the second image shows the 

reconstructed self-examination room. 
An inflatable plastic cushion sits in 
front of a curved mirror and suggests 
its usage. Gallery-goers would put on 
a VR headset while reclined on the 
cushion to enter a simulation of the 
operating room. A male doctor’s voice 
says ominous things while the tools of 
operation float overhead. 

The third and final space is 

a boutique hotel room space for 
recovery. The sheets are bubble 
wrap and pop after one usage. This 
last room — and the others too, for 
that matter — are not some twisted 
conceptions of f-architecture. They 
are rather a critical representation 
of the real clinics of Dr. Nader Saab 
in Beirut, clinics that reinforce the 
construction of virginity and bodily 
transformation under the guise of 
luxury and class. 

Armed with a sensitivity for the 

way space reinforces these existing 
power 
structures, 
f-architecture 

framed these clinics in a light surely 
no one had before. Although this all 
seems like more of an installation 
artist’s work than an architect’s, 
architectural 
education 
today 

engrains an apprehensive mindset 
in students. In an age of impending 
ecological disaster, what design really 
justifies its environmental cost?

Artist Profile: ComCo 

proves that COVID 
hasn’t killed comedy

‘The Nature of Nature’ shows us 

that ecological conservation makes 

economic and moral sense

Before 
the 
pandemic, 
The 

Comedy Company, better known 
as ‘ComCo,’ would pack the Angell 
Hall Auditorium for improv comedy 
performances. Their most dedicated 
fans would sit cross-legged on the 
floor, right before the elevated stage. 

LSA junior Finn Maloney likened 

ComCo shows to hanging out in a 
friend’s basement — just with over 
200 friends. 

Now, amid COVID-19 restrictions, 

the University of Michigan’s oldest 
improv group is shifting their live 
comedy to virtual platforms. Even fall 
auditions were switched to Zoom. 

Despite a lack of announcements 

and publicity during activities like 
Festifall and Northfest, ComCo 
still watched fifty auditions. Unlike 
improvising live, hopefuls auditioned 
from their bedrooms. 

“It was really interesting as people 

were, like, picking up stuff around the 
room and, like, hiding under blankets. 
That was just really fun, but not what 
we were looking for. And so we had 
to specify that you’re, like, in a room 
with lighting so we can see you and 
make sure you have your audio on,” 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior Ansleigh Hamilton said. 

Hamilton auditioned and joined 

ComCo her sophomore year after 
walking around Festifall. Recalling 
her all-denim ensemble, Hamilton 
describes walking up to the ComCo 
table as a “Hollywood magic moment” 
when ComCo member Archie Magnus 
pointed at her in the crowd. 

Like 
Maloney, 
Hamilton 

reminisces about the live shows of 
the pre-COVID era, missing feeding 
off the audience’s energy, even while 
underneath bright stage lights, the 
performers growing more and more 
sweaty with every scene. 

“We’re 
not 
just 
performers 

together. We’re friends, and that 
was part of what made it so strong,” 
Hamilton said. 

Founded in 1979, ComCo has 

developed traditions over the years, 
including the annual Ross show held 
in February. This ComCo staple was 
moved into video form and released 
on YouTube in December. Maloney 
describes the show as “a gift to (Ross 
seniors) who are about to graduate.” 

“We come in, and we all wear 

suits, and we’re, like, ‘oh, stocks and 
shit, I love that stuff.’ It’s never mean-
spirited, and usually, everybody’s in 
on the joke,” Maloney said.

Filmed socially-distanced outside 

the Ross School of Business, ComCo 
members donned their blazers, power 
suits and AirPods for their Ross-
inspired satire. Hamilton’s pug also 
made an appearance as a Ross alum. 

“There’s 
definitely 
an 
ironic 

distance between our performance 
and what we actually believe of Ross,” 
Maloney said. 

Maloney described the scaffolding 

of their normal in-person shows as 
rehearsed, like knowing which game 
is happening. At ComCo, games 
are the improv moments when the 
performers and audience are engaged. 

“Once the actual improv starts, it 

is completely improvised all the time, 
always,” Maloney said. 

About ten ComCo members filmed 

the Ross video in-person and socially 
distanced, while members outside of 
Ann Arbor had clips inserted. 

Both Maloney and Hamilton 

described members working on 
aspects of a video or performance 
that cater to their strengths, whether 
that be writing jokes, creating musical 
numbers or videography. 

Though live performances in 

crowded spaces are not currently 
safe, ComCo has found a way to 
keep the laughs coming. Two-hour 
rehearsals continue twice a week. 
Virtual hang-outs help build group 
chemistry, allowing members to 
replicate that energy in video and 
Zoom performances. Maloney found 
that hanging out, whether on Friday 
nights or sober practices, forges bonds 
vital to the group’s flow on stage. 

ComCo tried a trial Zoom show 

in the fall semester. Hamilton also 
hopes the annual year-end showcase, 
traditionally held at the Mendelssohn 
Theatre, can be made virtual this 
semester.

“I felt so welcomed when I was 

first in ComCo because they’d say, 
‘we’re gonna go to a party tonight’ or 
‘I’m grabbing brunch. You’re coming.’ 
This year, we can’t even hang out with 
our newbies and really get to know 
them,” Hamilton said.

Every child of the 2000s can 

recall exactly where they were when 
Jerry Seinfield’s magnum opus “Bee 
Movie” first graced the big screen. 
Indeed, I would argue that the 
defining moment of my childhood 
occurred when the all-too-fateful 
“Do ya like jazz?” playfully escaped 
the intoxicatingly seductive lips of 
Barry B. Benson. As a seven-year-
old, I lionized the insectoid idol with 
a fervor that could be characterized 
as obsessive. The lofty ideals and 
down-to-earth nature of dear Barry 
B. Benson, when juxtaposed with his 
almost flippant accessibility, crafted a 
black and yellow brand of heroism I 
couldn’t help but aspire to. 

Alas, as a jaded young adult, the 

family-friendly bildungsroman that 
once brought me such joy now brings 
me great existential agony. In my 
all-too-jarring transition into the 
adult world — a transition marked by 
adherence to a capitalist system that 
seeks to exploit my mind and body for 
profit, I discovered that the Bensons 
of this world are few and far between, 
and we need not examine their 
honey-tinted dogmas too long before 
uncovering a plethora of truly sinister 
forces at work. 

When analyzed in conjunction with 

similar industrial adventure narratives 
such as the iconic Marxist flick 
“Monsters, Inc.,” “Bee Movie” appears 
to follow a predictable but not trite 
formula. The marginalized worker 

gains an awareness of the manners by 
which a neoliberal economic system 
exploits him, and he consequently 
attempts to inform his comrades of 
their plight. He is mocked, rendering 
himself a pariah, a lunatic. He finds a 
way to seize control of the means of 
production, overthrowing the existing 
system of labor and rendering class 
order obsolete.

Or so it would appear.
In the first act of this laissez-faire 

tragicomedy, our six-legged savior 
agonizes over his career path, which 
he will inevitably pursue until the 
day he dies (much like you and me). 
He fears the inexorable absurdity 
that awaits him at the end of his life 
cycle, and cannot stomach a lifetime 
defined by the production and 
distribution of honey, a sticky and 
overt symbol for human’s monetary 
currency. Early in the film, Benson 
challenges convention by journeying 
outside the hive with the “pollen 
jocks,” who occupy the upper echelon 
of the proletariat (think “Mean 
Girls”’s Plastics of the bee world).

Benson’s 
journey 
into 
the 

commercial heart of New York City 
culminates in his realization that 
the bourgeoisie class of humans has 
profited from the labor of the bees for 
centuries. He then proceeds to sue 
the human race for their calculated 
exploitation of his species (evidently 
the ACLU wasn’t taking his calls). 
Barry’s unrelenting dedication to his 
fellow bees grants the audience the 
opportunity to view him as an altruistic 
savior, perhaps even as a metaphorical 
representation of Karl Marx himself. 

Nevertheless, despite his indefatigable 
commitment to justice, coupled with 
his fervent collectivist ideology, Barry 
B. Benson fails to bring about the 
dictatorship of the proletariat.

Benson 
seeks 
to 
overturn 

capitalist institutions using their own 
tricks. He pursues his cause through 
the human legal system with the aid 
of his Engelsian paramore, Vanessa. 
Vanessa’s involvement in Barry’s 
schemes is suspect, if not downright 
shady, as her flower shop depends on 
the exploitation of the pollen jocks. 
Hence, like Engels, her ideology and 
practice are ultimately contradictory 
in nature. The co-founder of Marxism 
condemned the treatment of factory 
workers 
while 
simultaneously 

owning several large textile factories.

Alas, the budding love affair 

between Barry and Vanessa cannot 
grow to fruition, primarily due to 
the inter-species divide; reality 
truly stings. This biological division 
serves as a mirror image of the 
socioeconomic 
division 
between 

bourgeois Vanessa and proletariat 
Barry. In his psychedelic daydreams 
about Vanessa, we see Barry floating 
in a pool of honey, as The Archies’ 
1969 hit “Sugar, Sugar” plays in the 
background. The constant invocation 
of “honey honey” is no accident. Barry 
associates Vanessa with honey, which 
in his world, is the sole marker of 
economic and social mobility. Hence, 
their love is ultimately superficial and 
economically motivated. 

“Bee Movie” cannot be accurately 

categorized as a Marxist triumph. In 
fact, I would assert that it is its very 

antithesis. Barry’s attempt to overturn 
the existing order for the greater good 
culminates in him instituting a free 
market economy for the bees. Their 
exploitation will continue, merely 
under a different label. Any attempt 
to take action outside of the neoliberal 
institutions of power ends in tragedy, 
which is further emphasized by 
the mortal wounds Barry’s friend 
Adam experiences in his attempt to 
physically attack a human. 

The supposedly happy ending 

of the film takes place when the 
bees return to the existing system 
of production with the addition of 
a few inconsequential concessions. 
They 
remain 
enslaved 
to 
the 

humans, producing honey with 
the efficiency of a disgruntled 
union worker, only this time with 
marginal improvements to their 
working conditions. Barry embraces 
his profession as a pollen jock and 
part-time lawyer in a futile attempt 
to integrate himself into the petite 
(no pun intended) bourgeoise of the 
human legal system. 

In his attempt to spearhead a 

proletariat revolution, my childhood 
idol finds himself trapped in the 
very system he sought to overturn. 
His 
overreliance 
on 
bourgeois 

institutions to take down the class as a 
whole leads to his ideological demise. 
The temptress Vanessa returns to 
her exploitative ways, utilizing bees 
for capital gain. In his glorious rage 
against the dying of the light, Barry 
finds himself less like a bee and more 
like a moth, incinerated instantly in 
his futile attempt to embrace glory.

The following is an excerpt from 

“Burning,” written by Jo Chang, a 
writer who typically avoids writing 
romances but decided to experiment 
with this short fiction piece. 

Where did you find this woman? 

I’ve never met anyone like her before. 
Last week, the first time I heard 
Naomi’s cries from the living room, I 
texted you in a panic.

 Hi naomi is crying? What should 

i do

Is she in her piano lesson rn
Yes
Its fine dont worry about it
“What?” I muttered to myself.
I guess in my head I was expecting 

someone like my own old piano 
teacher, a terse older European woman 
who seemed to get off on smacking 
the backs of my hands with a ruler she 
brought especially for that purpose. 
You’ve never met her, since I stopped 
taking lessons after the accident. But 
out stepped that woman who was 
almost as short as the eight-year-
old girl bouncing after her. The first 
thought that came into my mind was 
that she looked vaguely ill. I wondered 
how old she was. Younger than us, 
probably, maybe mid-twenties? She’s as 
small as a child and extremely fragile-
looking, pale skin with a greenish tint 
and dark circles under her eyes.

“Uh, hey,” I said. I had been in 

the middle of bringing up the clean 
laundry from the basement, and it was 
only after I instinctively reached out 
for a handshake that I realized I wasn’t 
wearing my usual cotton gloves.

The piano teacher hesitated also, 

and I thought it was in response to 
the scarred and twisted flesh I was 
extending out to her, but when she 
took her left hand out of her pocket I 
saw that she only had two fingers, the 
thumb and the pinky. Between them 
lay a smooth basin.

“It’s nice to meet you,” she said 

quietly. She had a lilting accent, a mix 
between British, and maybe Chinese? 
I flushed and tore my gaze away from 
her hand. “My name is Stella.”

“Nice to meet you,” I repeated. “I’m 

Olive.”

Her skin was clammy and cold, 

smooth and weightless as plastic. 

“I used to play the piano too,” I 

find myself telling the table over 
my plate of overcooked pasta. The 
three of us are sitting all together 
and the atmosphere feels amazingly 
awkward. Maybe it’s just me though; 
Naomi and Stella eat quietly but seem 
rather comfortable in the silence. I rub 
at an imaginary stain on my gloves, 
feeling like I am part of a weird parody 
of a nuclear family.

“Really?” She says. She’s barely 

made a dent in her pasta; Naomi 
reaches across the table for a second 
serving.

“When I was like, super young,” I 

ramble. “My parents really wanted me 
to learn music.” There’s a long pause, 
punctuated by the slurping noises of 
Naomi finishing up her second plate.

“Did you enjoy it?”
“Yeah,” I say. “I think I did.” The 

pasta is practically mush.

On her way out, after giving Naomi 

a final hug, Stella turns around and 
whoa she is way too close, I take a step 
back —

“Um,” she says. “If you ever want, 

I can teach you some piano. Again. If 
you want.” Her breath smells sweet, 
but the nauseating kind of cloying that 
makes me think of something rotting.

Naomi is asleep and I am in your 

office, at your desk, intent on working 
on my novel. A framed picture of you 
and me stands next to one of you and 
your first husband on your marriage 
day. There are no pictures of the new 
man. I do my best to avoid looking at 
both pictures. It’s so bizarre, to see 
photos of myself in your house. There 
are several that I have found in here so 
far, hanging and standing and pressed 
behind glass. In this one, we are 
around ten or eleven, just a few years 
older than Naomi, and we are sitting 
on the front step of our old apartment 
complex, smiling so hard it must have 
been painful. My red-raw hands sit 
inert in my lap. The golden beads in 
your hair flash in the sunlight.

You’d worn your hair in its natural 

style since I met you, but when we 
were nine years old you got your hair 
done in long box braids for the first 
time; your mother added these thick 
golden bands at the ends. I think you 
caught me staring at them wistfully 
once. They were so beautiful, they 
glinted in your dark hair like stars.

“Our hair isn’t the same,” I said. 

“We’ll never look the same. Because 
we’re not sisters.”

I think you took that the wrong way. 

I think you thought the expression on 
my face was sadness. “I know that,” 
you said. “But I think of you as my real 
sister —”

“No,” I interrupted. I held your 

gaze. “We’re not.”

I think that was the first time you 

saw the thing that was festering inside 
of me. The burning.

I am in love with you and you know it.
I tried to hate you, once. I don’t 

know if you even noticed, but that 
promise only lasted for maybe half 
a day, until you smiled and asked if 
I wanted to watch a movie together 
after school. I wish that I could. Hate 
you, I mean.

I accidentally fall asleep slumped 

over your desk, my neck limp as if it 
has been snapped. I have a dream 
about my lungs. I am at the doctor’s 
office and a woman who smells like 
thyme and coconut is raking her 
nails softly across my bare shoulders 
and down my spine with her cool 
dry hands. She slides a stethoscope 
between my breasts from behind and 
I try to remain as still as possible when 
I breathe in and then out, my breath 
is too loud in this white room. I can’t 
bear to turn around. I don’t smoke, 
I tell the doctor quickly. I already 
know, she replies and I can’t hear her 
voice but I know that she is speaking. 
Take a look. I peer down and my flesh 
has become transparent, everything 
inside of me has turned into paper. 
My liver and intestines are masses of 
origami, my heart is a crumpled ball. 
My veins have become dark lines of 
ink that seep all over the pages.

Before your family moved into the 

apartment three doors down I was 
losing my mind. I was six years old and 
dying of boredom and loneliness. Do 
you remember how in our apartment 
complex, we were the only living 
creatures under the age of thirty-five? 
Except for the hideous white dog that 
lived above us that had an unsettling 
habit of jumping off high surfaces with 
as much force as its tiny body could 
muster, so that at night it sounded like 
there were literal cats and dogs being 
flung onto the roof over our heads.

I’ve always had beautiful hands, 

it’s what everyone used to tell me. 
My mother would always say I had 
princess hands, all long fingers and 
soft skin. She was only half-joking 
when she’d tell me I should be a 
hand model when I grow up. My 
father would protest, only half-joking 
himself. “No,” he’d say. “Mi princesa 
is going to be someone big. Something 
special.”

We were all surprised when your 

mother took me in as her own after 
the accident. Our parents were not 
exactly friends, mostly because mine 
didn’t know much English and yours 
were always leaving early and coming 
home late from work. I was in a coma 
for a week after the accident, so I did 
not have time to worry about the 
fact that I was now an orphan — an 
orphan — with no living relatives in 
this country who did not even know 
how to spell the word “insurance.” 
That drunk driver didn’t just steal 
my parents from me. When the fire 
licked my arms up to the elbows and 
my long dark hair, I became someone 
who wasn’t a princesa anymore, a 
royal gown traded for a shorn head 
and hospital gown and hands encased 
in thick layers of plaster. Your mother 
was sitting at my side when I woke up, 
and hers was the first face I saw after 
being born into this new life. Even 
now, I will never stop thanking the 
God my parents prayed to every night.

Naomi looks almost nothing like 

you. I’m sure you’ve heard this many 
times already. She takes almost 
completely after her father, save for 
her ears, which stick out in the same 
endearing way that yours do. And 
you two eat the same way, quickly as 
if someone is about to steal each bite. 
When you two eat cereal, your teeth 
scrape against the spoon.

I only half-believe her when your 

daughter insists that you let her eat 
this kind of sugary garbage all the 
time, but she seems to be enjoying it so 
much that I can’t feel too bad. I pour 
myself some of the cereal too, to see 
what it tastes like.

“What d’ya wanna do today?” I 

ask her over my own bowl of what 
is essentially mini chocolate chip 
cookies soaked in milk. “It’s the 
weekend, there’s probably a lot of stuff 
to do around here, right?”

“Mmm,” she says absentmindedly. 

“I can’t think of anything.”

When you called me and asked 

for a favor, I agreed before you even 
finished explaining what it was, that 
you really needed to find someone to 
watch over Naomi for a week while 
you and he went on your honeymoon. 
Everyone else was too busy with 
work, or had their own kids, but even 
so, you would have asked me anyway, 
since you trust me the most in this 
entire world.

“But even so,” you continued. “I’m 

so sorry to ask, I know it’s a lot — ”

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s 

day? He asks.

The world must seem so beautiful
Through his rose-tinted looking 

glass,

Blinders fashioned from

Bouquets, Jewels, Promises.
The delusions of a romantic —

Is this sincerity? 

I’m not sure.

For a summer’s day is as beautiful 

as a dream,

A wish;

To dream of summer is to wish for

Escape. 
Perhaps

Flattery is an offense hidden

Behind soft petals of red,

A thorn —

For if this love be genuine,

Why escape

When I already await you here?

 

But thy eternal summer shall not 

fade, He says.

 But even statues must die.

An eternal summer is destruction 

disguised,

The Earth frozen in time,

The death of reality,

The end to natural bounty —

Love destroys even at its brightest.

 I am but a simple girl,

A simple woman,

Who longs for the snows of winter

The thunderstorms of spring

And the hovering death of 

autumn.

What do I do with this lover’s 

sonnet?

 A lover whose eyes

Stand captured by distant 

horizon,

Seeing past me, Through me

Anything but me.

What to do when love

Makes blind, Its willing victim,

Its unwilling sacrifice.

So long as men can breathe or eyes 

can see,

So long lives this, and this gives life 

to thee, He promises.

Am I now to be

Trapped —

A bird in a gilded cage

Of unfading green?

Is this love?

 I have never loved, and

My question echoes through the 

abyss

Of this hallowed chamber

Of the apple of his eye.

If he loves me, then why

Must I be punished to eternity?

Death is an old friend —

Does love demand abandonment?

Who is to say,

When the only one who speaks 

of love

Writes sonnets

Rose-tinted
Rose-stained.

“Coda”

“Cryptozoo”

“Amy Tan: Unintended Memoir”

“In the Earth”

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 

the Sundance Film Festival, like 
many events over the past year, had to 
adapt to the circumstances. Though 
the Festival’s fully virtual format 

meant that it may have lost some of 
its usual sense of authenticity and 
tradition, it also meant that the films 
were far more accessible. As a result, 
our writers were able to cover many 

more of these incredible, unique 
films than would have otherwise 
been possible.

Whether in-person or completely 

remote, Sundance Film Festival is 

a quintessential event for the film 
community. Our writers watched 
films with Oscar-winning actors 
and first-time filmmakers, as well 
as films that tested the bounds of 

contemporary filmmaking — films 
that made us laugh, cry, think or all of 
the above. 

This wide breadth of cinematic 

experiences 
made 
this 
year’s 

Sundance Film Festival a remarkable 
opportunity, and we are very proud 
of the content that we’ve created. 

— Kari Anderson and Sabriya 

Imami, Daily Film Editors

“The film depicts an evolution of 

Tan’s complex relationship with her 
mother — how a troubled childhood 
filled with clashes later led to a 
period of reconciliation, buoyed by 
a renewed understanding of her 
mother’s trauma. From there, the 
documentary seamlessly transitions 
into Tan’s writing and into the 
complexities of her celebrity.”

“‘Cryptozoo’ 
combines 
the 

speculative wit of Kurt Vonnegut, the 
visual surrealism of David Lynch and 
the aloof humor of Wes Anderson, 
with a helping of ‘Jurassic Park.’ 
It’s more than this approximation, 
though. ‘Cryptozoo’ isn’t just strange 
for strangeness’s sake — there’s a 
reason behind its madness, a bedrock 
of meaning beneath its shimmering 
psychedelic veneer.”

‘The Blazing World’ does way too 

much and nothing at all

Carlson Young (“Scream: The TV 

Series”) directs and stars as Margaret 
Winter in this feature-length version of 
her 2018 short film of the same name. 
The movie, a fantasy-meets-horror-
meets-drug trip exploration of trauma’s 
effect on the subconscious, plays with 
familiar tropes in unoriginal ways. 
After the tragic drowning of her sister 
(Lillie Fink, in her debut), survivor’s 
guilt plagues Margaret’s psyche, 
sparking nightmares and an interest in 
metaphysical spirituality. The audience 
is taken along on one of these rich and 
dramatic dreams for a journey that is 
too unbelievable to be enthralling.

I’m not sure if there is anything in 

“The Blazing World” that I had not 
seen before, though the source material 
was far too varied to feel like an homage 
to any particular filmic trend. That 
said, in Sundance’s post-screening 
Q&A, cinematographer Shane F. Kelly 
(“Boyhood”) cited Young’s love of 
obscure German horror from the ’80s 
as an influence; I confess I am ignorant 
of German horror, regardless of decade 
or degree of obscurity, so I cannot 
evaluate this claim. 

However, 
other 
apparent 

influences draw on a larger spectrum 
of film, from “Citizen Kane” to “2001: 
A Space Odyssey” to “Spirited Away.” 
The viewer is met with a barrage of 
filmmaking techniques, none of which 
necessarily complement one another, 
many relying on excessive CGI.

Most troubling of all is the 

oversimplicity of the narrative. In 
this way, the film feels like nothing 
more than a dragged-on short. We 
are never sure what is reality and 
what is dreamscape, so the “American 
Psycho”-like final revelation is not 
shocking or interesting. The beyond-
cliché tale in which a timid girl gains 
confidence through a quest is poorly 
executed, as there is no gradual 
change. The timid girl remains 
timid and afraid, with just enough 
determination to endure the quest’s 
challenges, and confidence comes as 
a deluge with minutes remaining in 
the film. This is not a story of growth 
though, even if it is set up to be.

On top of this limp formula, the 

lesson Margaret learns is eye-rollingly 
trite: We carry the dead within 
ourselves as memories. By the end of 
the film, the viewer is still in the dark 
about what is real and what is not. 
This lack of clarity blunts the effect 
of the film’s premise, that unresolved 
trauma can infect our dreams. 

Moreover, the idea that an event 

so tragic as to provoke decades of 
nightmares intoxicated by guilt and 
confusion could be dismissed by the 
simple realization that the dead are 
preserved in memory is an insult to 
trauma victims and trauma therapists 
everywhere. Those on the precipice 
of suicide or self-destruction are not 
rejuvenated with such ease.

Perhaps it is the utter simplicity 

of the film’s narrative elements that 
makes the blizzard of influences and 
otherworldliness so banal and campy. 

The camp element is not alleviated 
by the actors’ lack of dramatic range 
or odd high-school hangout scenes 
reminiscent of, dare I say it, “The 
Babysitter.” Unfortunately for Young, 
“The Babysitter” was funny — “The 
Blazing World” is not.

I will give credit to the set and 

lighting designers, as these elements 
would have been sufficient for a strong 
fantasy film had the story been better 
and the cinematography more focused. 
The abundance of flora within the 
stately, Southern-gothic home brings 
the “Alice in Wonderland” element 
front of mind. Composed by Isom 
Innis (“Foster the People”), the film’s 
score is also a highlight, except when 
it is not. A luscious blend of old-school 
cinematic horns with fantastical harp 
and immersive synth, the film opens 
with promise.

However, in a misguided attempt to 

emphasize every shadow in the corner 
and every sinister glance, the score 
overpowers the action on more than 
one occasion. As a stand-alone work 
of art, Innis’s score would evoke the 
emotions sought onscreen; alongside 
the visual, the strength of sound only 
highlights the weak storytelling.

The most imaginative creators 

must know when to pull back and let 
the story tell itself. It is eminently clear 
that Young is a highly imaginative 
filmmaker; she just hasn’t quite struck 
the balance between visual grandeur 
and a cohesive narrative. As a campy 
fantasy film with a few out-of-place 
scenes, “The Blazing World” will 
satisfy the undiscerning audience.

“‘In the Earth’ is completely a 

creature of the pandemic. The idea 
for the film was conceived on the 
first day of the U.K. lockdown. The 
film was shot during the summer 
months over 15 days, the first new 
British production since the crisis 
started. 

“But, as writer-director-editor 

Ben Wheatley (“Rebecca”) was 
quick to point out in the post-
premiere Q&A session, ‘In the 
Earth’ is not about the pandemic 
— it’s a reflection of our times. 
Some traces of lockdown living 
— natural themes of isolation 
and its strain on interpersonal 
relationships 
— 
are 
indelibly 

imprinted on it, but the film stands 
on its own two legs.”

‘Hive’ wins awards and smashes the patriarchy 

with bees and roast peppers

“Hive” is a quiet sort of film. The 

color palette is a bit subdued, the 
camerawork relatively plain. There’s 
no novel set piece or showstopping, 
paroxysmal performance. But just 
beneath those muted trappings, 
there is a writhing, soul-biting pathos 
that is most often spun by true-life 
stories. “Hive” is not a story about a 
maybe-maybe-not widowed Kosovan 
beekeeper trying to break into the 
pepper spread industry because 
writer-director Blerta Basholli simply 
sat around till the idea percolated from 
the ether and onto the script of her 
directorial debut. “Hive” is anything 
but ethereal — it’s earthly, depressive 
and, excusing some creative liberties, 
it very much happened.

In 
1999, 
a 
little 
village 
in 

southwestern Kosovo by the name of 
Krusha e Madhe was massacred by 
Serbian special police at the tail-end 
of the Kosovo War. Men were killed 
or kidnapped, leaving the village 
largely in the hands of women and 
children. One such woman is Fahrije, 
in “Hive” played by Yllka Gashi 
(“Kukuni”). At the beginning of the 

film, she’s rifling through body bags 
and burnet clothing: no luck. As one 
woman characterizes, Fahrije is one 
of the unlucky ones. Not because her 
husband is missing; that’s many or 
most of them, after all. The lucky ones 
are those that, having heard the worst, 
no longer have to “startle whenever 
the door knocks.”

With 
the 
local 
charitable 

organization suffering a chronic lack 
of funds and her apiary only trickling 
out the scantest dribbles of honey (she 
and her husband were beekeepers 
by trade — the movie’s called “Hive,” 
after all), Fahrije is forced to get down 
to business. To make ends meet — for 
herself, her family and the village, 
really — Fahrije has to learn how to 
drive to find work in the city making 
and selling avjar, a popular Balkan 
condiment.

And for this, she is decreed a whore. 

Repeatedly. By the café-loitering 
deadbeat men. By other women. By 
her own daughter. Because, you know, 
whores drive cars. Or something. Tiny 
villages in the Balkans don’t love an 
entrepreneurial woman. 

Fahrije is the sole and principal 

focus of “Hive,” despite a name 
suggestive of community. It’s about 
community, for sure — about family, 

about leaning on one another in tough 
times, about female solidarity — but 
Fahrije is indisputably the apple of 
the camera’s eye. It often tracks her 
across a scene, focusing on her face. 
Gashi, the woman who plays Fahrije, 
channels a subdued yet compelling 
gravity, conveying masked pain and 
unyielding 
tenaciousness 
behind 

perpetually 
somber 
expressions. 

Sorrowful 
but 
by 
no 
means 

lachrymose — it’s a picture of stoicism 
and the will to persevere. 

The modest nature of the film 

— the unimpressed might even 
call it banal — belies its historicity. 
It’s the first film to take home all 
three of the preeminent prizes 
of the World Cinema Dramatic 
Competition: 
the 
Directing 

Award, the Audience Award and 
the Grand Jury Award. A win for 
Kosovo (the film’s motherland), 
a win for burgeoning directorial 
talent Basholli, a win for the film’s 
principal star Yllka Gashi and 
a win for Fahrije Huti and the 
women of Krusha e Madhe.

In a manner that mirrors its 

modest yet historic nature, it’s 
the unique admixture of the bleak 
and the hopeful that made “Hive” 
so popular at this year’s Sundance 

Film Festival. Although the movie 
didn’t percolate from the ether, it’s 
anything but ethereal — war, loss, 
constrictive gender norms, these 
are everyday things. Not celluloid 
inventions — real, earthbound 
phenomena. A depressive reality. 

But this austere front belies that 

aforementioned 
undercurrent 

channeled by Gashi — just as 
death and loss are earthbound 
ordeals, so are endurance and 
companionship. The massacre 
happened 22 years ago. And just 
the same, a widowed beekeeper 
really did launch her own pepper 

condiment business to support 
her community and those she 
loves. 

Not everyone can be born in a land 

of milk and honey. “Hive” shows us 
how, when life gives you peppers, 
you make ajvar. With a few awards to 
boot.

We’re already moving full steam 

into the new semester, but I don’t 
think I’ve fully recovered from the 
previous one. Part of me wants to 
forge ahead and never look back at 
any part of 2020, but things don’t 
suddenly change when the clock 
strikes midnight, and the debris from 
the catastrophic year still lingers 
everywhere. It lingers in the unease 
and the discomfort of upending 
my first year of college. It lingers 
in my detached concept of home 
since we got sent back last March. 
And it lingers in my diminished 
sense of self caused by the agonizing 
purgatory that was quarantine. I 
know better than to think that the 
new year will change any of that, so 
here’s to looking back and finding 
comfort in the chaos of an otherwise 
cruel semester — to rediscovering 
what home feels like, above South 
University Avenue. 

As the last weeks of August 

approached, it was finally time to 
come back to Ann Arbor. It felt like 
coming back to life. After a six-month 
long haze, I was back to the most city-
life experience my small suburban-
upbringing self had known. And here 
I’d stay for the semester, in my room 
on the 16th floor of my apartment 
building. It was my cramped little 
space that allowed me to catch my 
breath for the first time in months. 
Things were different now. I was 
different. But the essence of my 
college coming-of-age was imminent. 
As the brilliant colors of the sunset 
faded into the first night of my 
post-quarantine freedom, I looked 
through my living room window to 
the street below. A line had begun 
to form outside of Brown Jug, and 
friends stumbled around, linked at 
the arms and masked up. That was 
the beginning of my infatuation with 
the eccentric character of South 
University Avenue. 

The semester would go on like 

this, and the weekend bustle would 
start as early as Wednesday, due to 
asynchronous schedules brought 
about by a new normal. 8 o’clock 
would bring the earliest sounds of 
soft laughter and music seeping 
through our windows, signifying the 
end of Zoom calls and the beginning 
of something more familiar. During 
a normal semester, I would be on 
my way to the UGLi for late hours 
of studying, but a long day of screens 
calls for more frequent breaks and 
new nightly routines. In time, my 
roommates and I took comfort 
in living vicariously through the 
people that walked down South U 
— it filled the void that came with 
missing out on what were supposed 
to be the best nights of our lives, in 
the name of public health safety. 
From above, we would drink along 
with the carousers, crafting the 
most ridiculous stories about those 
we saw and heard 16 floors down. 
Down there, that was Trish. With 
a skip in her step, she was on her 
way to meet up with the guy from 
class she kept pinned on her 11 a.m. 
Chemistry Zoom screen. She found 
home in romanticizing even the 
most reckless first dates.

On nights when Pizza House 

take-out was calling my name, I’d 
stay outside a bit longer, taking in 
the spirited characters of the street. 
From the rare political bar fights to 
the two people waiting outside of 
Champs Liquor Store standing too 
close to be just friends, I found home 
within the strangers that roamed 
South U. And slowly but surely, the 
deep disquiet of the past six months 
started to fade.

And when night turned to day, 

the sidewalks would populate with 
skateboard heads and students 
looking for a place to study. I’d peer 
down through my bedroom window, 
questioning the need for a sweatshirt 
in the early September morning. 
A woman running in shorts and a 
group of boys walking in t-shirts 

discouraged the extra layers as I got 
ready to make my own trek across 
campus. In those couple of seconds I 
spent gazing into the daily activities 
of people on that street, I felt comfort. 
I felt comfort in knowing that no 
matter how difficult the semester 
would get, we were in it together: me 
and my window view of this city and 
its people. And maybe that’s what 
coming home feels like. 

I remember the mess that was 

our first week of classes: from 
clashing Zoom calls in the living 
room to the dynamic sounds of the 
powerful Graduate Employees’ 
Organization 
strikes 
further 

down the street. It felt surreal 
and chaotic. That week stood as 
a painfully accurate precedent 
for the months to come, and as 
October turned into November, 
I promptly sensed the aftermath 
of an experimental semester gone 
wrong. But even in the chaos, I 
felt at peace in the home I had 
created. With the new lockdown 
order across campus, the street 
that once had so many stories to 
tell was empty, and my routine 
gaze down had lifted higher to 
the LED-lit living rooms and 
newly-decorated Christmas trees 
in the windows of the high-rises 
across from us. Every square was 
a different color; every square 
was a different story. Now, 
midterms and finals were upon 
us, and there was no time for idle 
people-watching. Nevertheless, as 
night time approached and lights 
flickered on, I was reminded of my 
pact with the view of South U. 

It’s hard to find what home is 

when you’re still caught in between 
who you are and who you’re 
becoming — when your concept of 
home continues to evolve as you do — 
and it’s even harder with the added 
uncertainty of the inexhaustible 
pandemic.

Iced Coffee, Four and Four

I’ve always ordered an iced 

coffee, four and four.

The sickly sweet drink has been 

my specialty since high school. It 
was a joke amongst anyone who 
knew me; they would pester me 
with well-meaning quips about 
the fact that every day, just like 
clockwork, I’d walk into class late 
with that predictable beverage in 
my hand. Even now, years after 
the fact, I can’t get myself to order 
anything else.

I’ve always been a creature 

of habit. My interests, routines, 
favorite 
songs 
and 
foods 

remained stagnant as the years 
went on. I never saw a problem 
with it –– these things brought 
me comfort, and I indulged in 
them for so long that they started 
to become mine. In my mind, I 
was defined by my unwaveringly 
long hair, unchanging music taste 
and steadfast coffee order. But 
this past year, I’ve felt a gnawing, 
incessant need to change. The 
familiarity began to feel less like a 
comfortable security blanket and 
more like a suffocating character 
flaw. I was petrified that years 
had gone by and I’d been standing 
completely still. 

Perhaps this fear was rooted 

in the fact that lately, everything 
has been changing. With so 
many things out of our control 
–– a shut-down world, the loss of 
family members and friends, our 
compromised routines and sense 
of normalcy –– familiarity feels 
foreign. We cut our quarantine 
bangs, rearrange the furniture 
in our rooms and look for ways 
to reinvent and seize control over 
lives that suddenly feel a little less 
vibrant. I’m no different. Rather 
than embracing my penchant 
for consistency, I felt an urgent 
desire to change something, 

anything, about myself. 

So instead of shuffling through 

the same Taylor Swift album I’ve 
listened to since freshman year 
of high school, I forced myself to 
listen to experimental post-punk 
records. I started to never use 
the same car air freshener scent 
twice. I tried (and failed) every 
15-day ab challenge, 15 times over. 
I took risks at the drive-thru, 
and feigned surprise when I 
hated the way that black coffee 
bitterly coated my tongue. 

My 
miniscule 
vies 
for 

spontaneity were rooted in this 
need to have changed in some way 
over the course of the past year. 
However, I’ve found that those 
small acts were disingenuous for 
me. The bizarre need to prove 
that I’ve evolved, as if such a feat 
is dictated by new hair or music, 
just convinced me that any of my 
“normals” made me boring and 

needed correcting. Even worse, it 
presupposed me as a static, two-
dimensional creature, discrediting 
the real change I’d made –– the 
kind I couldn’t immediately see.

That change, the gradual kind, 

sneaks up on you. I don’t think 
you realize it until it has already 
shifted your perspective and 
simply becomes you. For me, the 
change that I had been actively 
pursuing was happening all along, 
quietly and unsuspectingly. 

One day, that particular bad 

memory I could never speak 
about without crying no longer 
evoked tears when I told the story. 
One day, my friend off-handedly 
mentioned that she was so proud of 
how much I had matured, and that 
she’d noticed it over the past few 
months and never said anything. 
One 
day, 
the 
“end-of-the-

world” embarrassing moments 
and heartbreaking rejections I 
thought I could never get over 
began to take up less space in my 
mind, until I didn’t think about 
them at all. I had never noticed or 
appreciated this kind of change, 
but it’d been happening all along. 

I think that the pressure to 

have a new, exciting version of 
yourself to parade doesn’t require 
compromising the things we 
define ourselves by now, in fear 
of being boring. In some ways, I 
think that we are a new, exciting 
version of ourselves every day. 
Time necessitates change, and 
this change shapes us whether 
we like it or not. The things we 
learn and the experiences that 
strengthen us culminate silently, 
even if your coffee order has 
never changed or you’ve had the 
same favorite song since middle 
school. I realize that now and 
can appreciate the growth that 
I’ve made when I wasn’t even 
looking. 

Today, I ordered an iced 

coffee, four and four. I never 
liked black coffee anyway.

Notifications are ruining my life

MARINA SUN
MiC Columnist

I have 997 unread emails. 188 texts 

to open. 2 Instagram direct messages 
about the latest viral food video. And 
I’m feeling overwhelmed. 

As the winter semester grinds to 

a start, I’ve realized that a malicious 
byproduct of virtual learning has 
emerged: 
notifications. 
Endless 

Facebook 
postings 
about 
club 

recruitment, classmates blurting their 
existential crisis in the 200+ person 
GroupMe, 
or 
automated 
Piazza 

Activity Digest emails –– I’m over 
it. And as a new semester welcomes 
an opportunity to start fresh, I’m 
coming in with a new perspective: 
Notifications are ruining my life. 

Notifications are skewing my self 

worth. I used to watch my Instagram 
like a hawk after posting a self-
indulgent picture, dragging my finger 
down the screen to refresh the like 
count, and believing so intently that 
off-red digital hearts could quantify 
my popularity or impact my personal 
happiness. There was something 
terrifyingly instant about the way 
a two-sentence update could make 

me feel like a sudden sensation or an 
invisible nobody, and with each glance 
at my phone I felt an increasing sense 
of anxiety to keep momentum with an 
ever-moving online atmosphere. 

Notifications are cluttering my 

digital and mental clarity. Even before 
the fall semester had begun, my 
newly created university email inbox 
was inundated with a never-ending 
avalanche of notifications. “Join our 
Physical Activity Study,” “Alumni 
Association Welcomes You” and 
“MPrint Maintenance Tomorrow” 
were amongst the endless stream of 
messages that occupied my digital 
space, and the sheer volume of niche 
information often overshadowed a 
rare important update from a professor 
or recruiting opportunity. Checking 
my email became an unappealing 
chore, as my mental disorganization 
simultaneously worsened with each 
increase in unread messages. 

Notifications are overwhelming 

my daily schedule. I nervously refresh 
application portals or my email inbox 
for hours, burning precious time while 
awaiting news of a club acceptance 
or internship application decision. 
Hours have genuinely been wasted 

this way, as any thoughts of other 
priorities or personal nourishment are 
pushed aside in favor of capturing the 
exact moment an update rolls onto the 
screen. I depend on notifications for 
validation, let them control my moods 
and watch helplessly as my personal 
connections dwindle until all I am left 
with is my own anxiety –– and that has 
to stop. 

Notifications are ruining my life, so 

this semester I’m turning them off. The 
emails, the texts, and yes –– even the 
Bachelor Twitter updates. I’ve been 
prioritizing connecting to the wrong 
network for too long, losing focus 
on my mental health and the simple 
benefits of human communication. 
Now I check my phone when I want 
to. If something is urgent, people will 
call. Suddenly the tense feeling in my 
shoulders has eased, and I experience 
a rare moment of control.

I don’t know how many emails 

I have. And the air is oddly quiet 
in the absence of a text vibration. 
Refreshingly, each step is fueled by a 
calmness and conviction to resist any 
urge to glance at my phone — I’ll check 
my Instagram direct messages later, 
after this walk.

Revisiting Jonestown: What we can learn from the 1978 mass-murder suicide

ANCHAL MALH

MiC Columnist

warning: 
this 
article 

discusses abuse and suicide. 

Growing up in New York City, my 

mother always tried her best to ensure 
that I felt connected to my heritage 
and the land my ancestors came from. 
This meant only having pepper-pot on 
Christmas Day, learning how to play 
cricket on the weekends and watching 
Indian movies every Saturday night. On 
Wednesday nights, after I had turned 
nine years old, she sat me down with a 
notebook and pen and began teaching 
me Guyanese history. Her eyes always 
lit up with pride as she educated me 
about the colors of Guyana’s flag and 
their symbolism: green for the beautiful 
forests that encompassed the region, 
white for the ever-flowing bodies of 
water, gold for the country’s abundance 
of minerals, black for the people’s 
perseverance to make Guyana a better 
country and red for the dynamic nature 
that holds together an independent 
nation. However, for this week’s history 
lesson, the dim light in the corner of 
our living room fell on her face, but the 
light in her eyes faded as she recalled the 
horrifying mass murder-suicide that 
occurred almost 43 years ago. 

We often say, “Don’t drink the 

Kool-Aid” to warn individuals not 
to blindly believe everything they 
hear. However, people may not know 
that this phrase stems from mass 
manipulation and false promises 
that ultimately led to more than 
900 dead bodies abandoned in the 
rainforests of Guyana –– the largest 
loss of American civilian lives pre-9/11 
(excluding natural disasters). 

Jim Jones was born on May 31, 

1931, in Crete, Ind. He would go on 
to become a preacher at the Peoples 
Temple, an Evangelist group based 
in San Francisco. In the 1950s, Jones 
became a leader who promoted 
desegregation and racial equality. He 
eventually gained a large following 
of primarily elderly, Black women 
and children due to his charismatic 
personality and ideas that preyed 
on an audience seeking acceptance 
in society. “My life was in turmoil, 
I had a failed marriage and I was 
looking for a place to be political in a 
safer environment after a series of bad 
decisions,” Laura Kohl, a survivor of 
Jonestown, stated when questioned 
about why she felt a sense of comfort 
in the Peoples Temple. However, with 
Jones’s newfound fame as a preacher, 
he became increasingly paranoid of 
the American government’s scrutiny. 

Jones preached about creating a 

utopian socialist society located in 
the jungles of Guyana to his followers 
who, believing in this, donated their 
money to move to Guyana and create 
a community named Jonestown. His 
supporters believed they were going to 
be welcomed by the tall palm trees that 
graced the rainforests of Guyana. They 
believed the wide and bright green 
leaves would protect them from the 
injustices they were facing in America. 
However, 
when 
these 
followers 

arrived, they were met with small 
and shabby huts located on nutrient-
deprived soil that was not sustainable 
for large groups. Their utopian socialist 
society resembled a prison camp. 
Survivors of Jonestown recall having 
to work long hours with minimal food 
while suffering abuse from Jones. 
He forced his followers to write him 
letters explaining their fears and past 
mistakes, and if he perceived that they 
“betrayed” him, Jones would divulge 
the information at weekly public 
meetings. “He started to alienate you 
from your families … destroy that 
family unit,” said Jonestown survivor 
Yulanda Williams. “So that then he 
could become the predator, but also 
the one who was the provider of 
every need that you required in life.” 
In addition, Jones would rehearse 

mass suicides in which followers were 
instructed to drink a beverage called 
Flavor-Aid, which was concocted by 
mixing a fruit-flavored powder with 
water, similar to Kool-Aid. Jones 
repeated this frequently as a test of 
their loyalty to ensure that on the day 
he officially decided to proceed with 
the previously mentioned murder-
suicide, Jonestown would have no 
survivors. 

Friends and families of followers 

that went to Jonestown became 
concerned with the idea that their 
loved ones were being held against 
their will after receiving letters that 
they believed were not truly written 
with excitement and joy. Concerned 
with the complaints from relatives 
and from reports of horrendous 
living conditions at Jonestown, U.S. 
Representative Leo Ryan, D-Calif., 
wrote to the House of Foreign Affairs 
asking to make a visit to the Peoples 
Temple in Guyana. Initially, Jones 
refused to have Rep. Ryan as a guest 
but eventually allowed him to come.

On Nov. 18, 1978, Rep. Ryan arrived 

on the Port Kaituma airstrip with 
several journalists and was allowed 
to visit the commune. During his visit, 
people in the commune told Rep. 
Ryan they wished to return home. 
Tension rose within the community 

as Jones became aware of this, so he 
decided to finally conduct the mass 
murder-suicide. As Rep. Ryan was 
on the Port Kaituma airstrip, he and 
several other journalists were shot by 
gunmen affiliated with the Peoples 
Temple. While Rep. Ryan was being 
attacked, followers at the commune 
were ordered to drink a grape-flavored 
punch laced with cyanide. After 
bodies dropped to the floor, Jones had 
his gunmen traverse the commune 
to ensure that all of his followers 
died. When examining bodies from 
Jonestown, 
inspectors 
discovered 

injections on many, affirming claims 
that those who played dead were 
later injected with lethal poison. Any 
remaining survivors were either asleep 
during the event, posed as a part of 
Rep. Ryan’s party or were sent by 
Jones to retrieve supplies or carry out 
negotiations with different nations.

As we move forward and reflect 

on the events of Jonestown, we must 
be mindful of the people who lost 
their lives seeking a paradise and 
liberation from constricting societal 
bounds. We must respect the efforts 
of the journalists who accompanied 
Rep. Ryan and sought to unmask the 
ugly truths of Jonestown. Survivors 
of 
Jonestown 
are 
continuously 

reminded of the psychological harm 

and danger they faced, many feeling 
extreme guilt for making it out alive. 
Saying “Don’t drink the Kool-Aid” 
belittles the events of Jonestown and 
mocks the people who were victims of 
Jones’s terror. It reduces Guyana to a 
mere shell of a horrific legacy. 

When I think of Guyana, I hear 

the sound of Tassa drums ringing 
through the air on wedding days, 
signaling a time of joy and celebration 
in a neighborhood. I remember my 
summer visits to Guyana as a child, 
and I feel my bare feet touch the rocky 
ground, the clay-like soil seeping 
through my toes as I played hide and 
seek with my cousins. I see the cows 
roaming the neighborhood, heading 
towards the trenches to graze on the 
grass and sip water flowing through. I 
see the local shops that sell traditional 
Indian clothing, sarees and lenghas 
covered in small crystal diamonds 
with carefully hemmed neon flowers 
at the edge of each piece. But when 
the harmful idiom is said, it ceases 
the tropical breeze, dries out the 
water of my ancestor’s land, makes 
the once vibrant green leaves wilt in 
the sun and reduces Guyana to a mass 
graveyard.

“That change, 

the gradual kind, 
sneaks up on you. 
I don’t think you 
realize it until it 

has already shifted 
your perspective 

and simply 

becomes you. For 
me, the change 
that I had been 
actively pursuing 
was happening all 
along, quietly and 
unsuspectingly.”


This past year has been a lot to deal 

with and having constant access to 
news about the traumas of our realities 
has only worsened our mental health. 
Especially in the Black community, it 
seems like every time we recover from 
one thing and find some happiness, 
another disastrous headline or tragic 
event surfaces to bring us back down. 
The Black community has lost many of 
our brothers and sisters since January 
2020. Kobe Bryant, George Floyd, 
Breonna Taylor, Chadwick Boseman, 
John Lewis, Ahmaud Arbery, Cicely 
Tyson, Hank Aaron, Natalie Deselle-
Reid and Naya Rivera are only a few of 
the angels we have recently gained. 

We’re facing these heartbreaking 

losses while the pandemic keeps us 
isolated from the distractions and 
loved ones we go to for comfort. We’ve 
constantly hoped and searched for 
a light that will guide us out of this 
lonely darkness, only to be thrown 
in deeper. One way I have tried 
to bring myself out of the empty 
darkness is by absorbing Black joy 
through different artistic mediums. 
I’ve listened to a lot of music by 

my favorite Black artists and read 
inspirational books by Black authors, 
but I have spent most of my time 
watching countless movies and films 
I’ve loved my whole life that showcase 
Black voices in a positive light. 

Nostalgia has pushed these classic 

reruns back into my life, including 
“Cinderella” with Whitney Houston 
and Brandy, “Black Panther”, “Jump 
In!” and many other films that 
brought me joy when I was younger 
and when the world seemed so much 
brighter. Revisiting these old sources 
of happiness have been great ways 
to take my mind off the turmoil 
this country is undergoing. While I 
enjoyed these trips down memory 
lane, I couldn’t help but notice how 
many of my favorite films don’t 
illustrate Black people in the positive 
way that I remember. 

Disney was a staple in my 

childhood. Its filmography was a 
big source of my happiness. These 
movies and shows made me feel 
like I could achieve anything in my 
wildest dreams. A notable film that 
I was excited to rewatch was “The 
Princess and the Frog.” I loved this 
movie as a kid because Tiana, the 
only Black Disney princess, was the 
only princess I was able to see myself 

in. The music, the characters, the 
plot, everything about the movie 
made me so happy as a kid. Watching 
it again brought me some joy, but why 
is the only Black Disney princess a 
frog for the majority of her film? I 
didn’t notice this when I was eight. 
I was just happy to finally have 
that representation. It caused me 
to wonder why that representation 
has to come at such a dehumanizing 
cost? Why do displays of Black joy 
always come with a price? Disney is 
supposed to be a place where dreams 
come true. My dream is to live in a 
society free of racists and racism, but 

I guess that is one dream Disney isn’t 
willing to grant.

Now that I am older, I am able to 

catch the subtle hints of racism in 
dialogue, like in “Total Drama Island”. 
I’m over Black characters dying first 
in horror films like in “Scream 2”. I 
am sick of the role of the Black best 
friend being implemented in shows 
and films just so they can be awarded 
their diversity points, like in “Clueless”. 
I can’t help but wonder if Tiana would 
still be my favorite princess if I was 
given more options, ones that aren’t 
as demeaning. I’m either asking 
why there are no Black people in 

a film or TV show, or, if I’m lucky 
enough to get that representation, I 
find myself asking why the plots are 
so saturated with racism? 

I love the displays of Black culture 

in “The Princess and the Frog,” but I 
am no longer willing to accept the 
underlying consequences as a price 
for this exposure. It’s 2021, and 
Black stories about our happiness 
without having to overcome some 
kind of racial tragedy have been 
long overdue. That being said, not all 
displays of Black culture have been 
negative; movies and shows like 
“Little”, “Soul”, “The Wiz”, “The 

Fresh Prince of Bel-Air”, “Black is 
King”, “That’s So Raven”, “Coming 
to America”, “Bad Boys” and so 
many more are great examples of 
this display of unapologetic Black 
culture. Movies that encourage you 
to find your purpose, love who you 
are and rise above the standard 
are uplifting messages that the 
Black community and our Black 
children should be able to access. 
These positive messages within 
Black representation have given me 
that hope I have been looking for 
amongst the darkness. I can’t wait to 
see what comes next.

There exists an overwhelming 

amount of cognitive dissonance 
when it comes time to address the 
awful actualities of former President 
Barack Obama’s legacy, but if we want 
to ensure that the era of Trumpism is 
truly gone for good, it must be done, 
lest we are doomed to repeat the 
mistakes of the past. As the first Black 
president of the United States, Obama 
was, and still is for many, a symbol of 
progress and hope. For people my age, 
he was the first president many of us 
have memories of — and juxtaposed 
with the recent administration, it’s 
easy to feel a sense of nostalgia for the 
bygone era of his presidency. But this 
nostalgia for Obama is just that –– 
nostalgia –– and it ignores the reality 
of the fact that his administration was 
right-wing, white-supremacist and 
imperialist in nature.

To start, one of the most overlooked 

ways the first Black president harmed 
his own people was abroad in Africa. 
Through the United States Africa 
Command, which originated in 2008 
under President George W. Bush, 
Obama oversaw its advancement and 
expansion as he worked effortlessly 
to continue neo-colonialism by 
extending U.S. influence throughout 
Africa via military dominance. 

Domestically, Obama arguably 

made it his mission to harm Black 
Americans. 
His 
administration 

contributed 
more 
heavily 
to 

the militarization of the police 
than any president, leading to an 
overwhelming increase of police 
brutality in Black America. This 
directly resulted in the emergence of 
the Black Lives Matter movement, 
which, as you may recall, started 
during the Obama administration for 
this reason. Ultimately, the Obama 
administration responded to this 
movement and subsequent protests 
by sending troops and tanks to 

Ferguson, calling Baltimore rioters 
“thugs” and working to increase 
surveillance of prominent Black 
activists — sound familiar?

Looking toward immigration, 

Obama’s 
immigration 
policy 

resulted in fostering the growth 
of 
Immigration 
and 
Customs 

Enforcement. Starting in 2008, 
his administration cultivated the 
Alien Transfer and Exit Program 
which 
deliberately 
sought 
to 

create complications for migrants 
seeking to cross the border, by 
separating them from their families 
and shipping them off to mystery 
locations without any identification 
or means to contact their loved 
ones. 
As 
his 
admisinistration 

continued on, it participated in 
the deportation and removal of 
nearly 2.7 million undocumented 
immigrants. Additionally, it caused 
tens of thousands of undocumented 
parents to be stripped of contact 
with their own children, most 
likely forever; some “disappeared” 
only to be found in countries 
they weren’t even from, where 
they were most likely trafficked, 
sexually abused or killed. On top 
of this, in 2014, the administration 
constructed 
border 
detention 

facilities with the sole purpose of 
placing 
undocumented 
parents’ 

children in cages. The growth in 
detainment of immigrants occuring 
during the Obama era proved 
especially lucrative for firms like 
Corrections Corporation of America 
and GEO Group, two companies that 
contributed hundreds of thousands 
to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential 
campaign. 

From 
his 
military 
coup 

in 
Honduras, 
displacing 
the 

democratically-elected 
leftist 

government of Manuel Zelaya and 
putting a far-right narco-dictatorship 
in its place, to his parliamentary 
coup in Brazil, which gave rise to the 
fascist Bolsonaro regime, to his soft 
coup in Paraguay, to his managing 

of Project Gunrunner, which led 
to armed drug cartels in Mexico 
with thousands of weapons, to the 
sanctions he imposed on Venezuela 
after declaring it an “extraordinary 
threat to the national security of the 
United States,” the great instability 
regarding immigration is not only the 
fault of the Obama administration, 
but Obama as well. If you’re appalled 
at the violence that took place at the 
U.S. Capitol last month, imagine how 
the citizens of these countries felt 
when forces of U.S. imperialism came 
to wreck havoc and unleash chaos in 
their home countries, all in service of 
capital and Western hegemony. 

On the other side of the 

globe, Obama was also actively 
destabilizing the Middle East, 
having 
dropped 
over 
26,000 

bombs on seven Muslim-majority 
countries in 2016 alone (a low 
estimate). 
His 
administration 

conducted 
airstrikes 
in 
Syria, 

Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, 
Somalia and Pakistan and led a 
drone-strike program in which 90% 
of the people killed were civilians, 
or non-enemy combatants. During 
his time as president, he initiated 
the civil war in Yemen and offered 
$1 billion in weapons sales to Saudi 
Arabia, resulting in one of the 
largest modern-day humanitarian 
catastrophes with over hundreds 
of thousands of casualties. Obama 
armed the Israeli apartheid regime 
with $38 billion in military aid and 
launched a war in Libya, using 
NATO to support rebel groups of 
Islamist extremists and resulting 
in the destablization of the Libyan 
government and an increase in slave 
markets. Yet, while the president 
who allegedly told a White House 
aide in 2011, “Turns out I’m really 
good at killing people. Didn’t know 
that was gonna be a strong suit 
of mine” continues to be seen as 
a beacon of good in the Western 
world, the Global South still suffers 
from the evils of his legacy. 

With the U.S. military being 

one of the largest polluters, bigger 
than 
140 
countries 
combined, 

producing more greenhouse gas 
emissions than any other institution 
on the planet, it’s clear the Obama 
administration was not the climate-
change conscious, science-believing 
administration it led the American 
public to believe it was. Furthermore, 
Obama worked diligently to increase 
domestic oil production to record 
levels and allowed police officers 
to attack Indigenous protestors at 
Standing Rock in order to build a 
corporate oil pipeline. 

As 
Paulo 
Freire 
wrote 
in 

Pedagogy 
of 
Freedom, 
“The 

capitalist system reaches, in its 
globalizing neoliberal crusade, the 
maximum efficacy of its intrinsically 
evil nature.” This was embodied in 
the Obama administration, and from 
a dialectical standpoint, because 
of its fundamentally contradictory 
nature, ushered in the era of 
Trumpism we just witnessed. 

Naturally, it’s very easy to read 

these accounts, hear these details, see 
these article links and brush them off 
as “things of the past.” It’s even easier 
to justify these atrocities by saying 
that “Trump did these things, too.” 
It’s even easier to trivialize them by 
pointing to the positive aspects of 
Obama’s presidency. What’s hard, 
is making a conscious decision to 
modify our behavior and attitude 
in order to overcome the cognitive 
dissonance we face when we hear 
the truth about someone we once 
admired. If we really want to say 
“no thanks” to Obama, we can start 
by remembering that these aren’t 
simply article links and facts. These 
are real events that happened to 
real people with real families whose 
lives (if they still have them) have 
been changed for the worse, forever, 
because 
of 
President 
Obama’s 

administration. And if you think 
that’s bad, wait till you find out who 
his vice president was.

Biblioamorapathy is a 

made-up word

Biblioamorapathy. 
Adjective, 

though in some especially sneaky 
cases, functions as a noun. Derived 
from 
the 
Latin 
roots 
“biblio,” 

meaning book, “amora,” meaning 
love and “pathy,” to feel. Defined as 
the special sort of giddy feeling one 
gets after checking out a particularly 
large stack of books from the local 
library, or happening across a dirt-
cheap box of yellowed, dog-eared, 
paperback novels at a yard sale –– the 
kind of yard sale held in a desperate 
attempt to exhume a home of all its 
oddities. It’s the painting of a poppy 
field in Marseille whose colors 
bleed so finely together under the 
fluorescence of display, yet seem so 
entirely out of place on the blank wall 
above the couch in the living room; 
spider web-fractured holiday-themed 
mugs gifted by friends who were 
now nothing more than strangers 
exchanging tight-lipped smiles. A 
feeling that comes from the beautiful 
realization that the book forced upon 
you by your world literature teacher, 
with indiscernible brown stains in its 
margins and blue arrows and circles 
around seemingly meaningless words 
left by students past, ultimately proved 
itself to be the kind of book you found 
yourself counting hours, minutes and 
seconds until the next encounter. 
Biblioamorapathy, in its entirety, is a 
feeling of pure elation –– one that has 
never been defined before in any kind 
of classical dictionary, thesaurus or 
new-age search engine that interprets 
popular slang for Generation X. 

Though in order to truly define 

biblioamorapathy, or any other 
word for that matter, we must 
trace its origins, obtain a sound 
understanding of all its varying 
contexts and tenses, so that when 
we finally do put it into writing, in 

extensively detailed research papers, 
in beasts of literary works conceived 
in the most peculiar of ways –– 
perhaps while standing up, in the 
shower, writing in exclusively bright 
pink ink — we know in our hearts 
that we have done the word proper 
justice. I first became acquainted 
with biblioamorapathy the minute I 
learned to read; I found it intertwined 
within anecdotes on the backs of 
cereal boxes in seizure-inducing 
color palettes, no doubt an attempt 
to distract from the potential health 
implications that would soon arise 
from the sheer amount of saturated 
fats. I found it in “Fun with Dick and 
Jane,” in the boyish exploits of “Frog 
and Toad,” later in the home I created 
at Hogwarts alongside Harry Potter, 
and soon after in the gardens of the 
Brontë sisters and Dante’s journey 
through Inferno. 

Biblioamorapathy manifests itself 

in a multitude of ways –– the most 
common a telltale nagging itch that 
tickles the pit of your stomach and 
soon diffuses into your bloodstream, 
seeping into the folds of your grey 
matter, coating the endings of your 
nerves, so that in due time, every fiber 
of your body begins to vibrate with an 
unseen force of belligerent joy. The 
only remedy is immediate exposure 
to the half-finished book splayed 
on your bedroom floor, the novel 
with a department store coupon 
for a bookmark in the recesses of 
your bag vehemently demanding 
to be read. Biblioamorapathy is 
a learned sensation, devoid of 
any innate predisposition, born 
from the ability to love books and 
be loved by books. While often 
mistaken 
for 
heart 
problems, 

indigestion, or Langston Hughes-
esque weary blues, it’s important to 
understand that biblioamorapathy 
isn’t a complication but rather a gift 
endowed upon the lucky few of the 
world.

What went wrong: Egypt’s political landscape and the impact of the youth

MARIAM ALSHOURBAGY

MiC Columnist

“Kefaya!” (Enough!) screamed the 

Egyptian youth as Hosni Mubarak 
planned his fifth six-year presidential 
term. “Kefaya!” they said to their 
parents and grandparents when told 
to sit back down and wait for time 
to mend their country. “Kefaya!” 
they yelled to the painfully familiar 
corruption 
and 
manipulation. 

“Kefaya!” became the motto of the 
Egyptian youth in a movement not 
only in opposition to the old regime 
but against an entire ideology 
ingrained in the minds of all Egyptian 
generations prior. 

Egypt’s youth, aged 30 and 

under, makes up 60% of the entire 
population. So on Jan. 25, 2011, when 
they stood together in Tahrir Square, 
they took the nation by surprise. They 
were the first in generations to stand 
united against oppression despite the 
insurmountable obstacle it presented: 
The Egyptian government comprises 
individuals 40 years of age and older 

with decades of experience in politics. 
So even as the revolutionaries gained 
more optimism and secured their 
first hearing with the government, 
who could they have sent to make 
negotiations? The fight came down 
to some naive 20-year-olds trying to 
negotiate with military strategists 
who had years of experience in 
feigned appeasement. 

There is a false dichotomy when 

it comes to analyzing the political 
and economic reasons behind the 
revolution. The Egyptian people spent 
30 years under Mubarak’s inefficient, 
irresponsible and corrupt regime. 
One cannot group the protestors’ 
grievances under either politics or the 
economy as the citizens endured low 
wages, collapsing health care and a 
failing education system to the point 
that other nations began to know 
Egyptians as apathetic and apolitical. 
The Egyptians needed a revolution 
to restore their dignity, stolen by 
Mubarak’s 30-year-long tyranny.

Nonetheless, 
these 
protesters 

made the mistake of listening to the 
older generations, who told them to 

be “grateful that the President even 
mentioned, or reiterated, some of 
the demands” they made. So they 
washed the graffiti, swept the roads 
and left the square before securing 
any of their demands. Nevertheless, 
they were still optimistic –– after 
all, nothing had ever before grabbed 
the attention of the government or 
prompted the whole nation to stand 
together. Right after that, Mubarak 
stepped down and public officials 
speedily organized an election and 
several candidates were nominated 
on the platform of representation and 
democracy. However, did the National 
Association for Change, the Coalition 
of the Revolution’s Youth, independent 
trade unions, independent Islamists, 
the radical left, the March 9 
Professors, human rights groups, 
the Constitutional Referendum and 
the Muslim and Christian religious 
establishments who came together in 
support of the 2011 revolution all want 
the same thing? Yes and no.

United in wanting Mubarak out 

of office, but divided by political and 
religious ideologies, each group was 

left scrambling for points of cohesion. 
Meanwhile, the military, on the 
opposing side, proposed a single man, 
Ahmed Shafik, to run their campaign 
instead of splitting their votes over 
multiple runners, a strategy that came 
at a great cost for the revolutionaries 
as it once again deepened the divide 
between the people. And although 
the military did not successfully elect 
their candidate, this divide proved 
insurmountable –– no one candidate 
seemed able to pacify the country.

These mistakes have something 

in 
common: 
inexperience. 
The 

revolution of 2011 was an uprising by 
the youth and for the people, but the 
youth did not have a point of reference 
or the guidance of wiser minds –– even 
the oldest generation alive was born 
in the midst of this corruption. The 
younger generation was vulnerable 
to the manipulation of military 
officials and the older politicians that 
made up the regime. Nevertheless, 
this youth would grow up and prove 
they have an advantage. They saw 
the power they had when they stood 
behind a common purpose with a 

single voice and gained an increased 
understanding of what goes on behind 
closed doors in Cairo. As they look 
forward, being part of the revolution 
of Jan. 25 against Mubarak’s regime 
gives them the experience they need 
to engage in more successful political 
activism in the future.

Fast forward to 2021, and Egypt 

is still suffering under military 
leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. After 
the mishaps of the last political 
revolution, Egypt was in ruins, and 
the fastest way to reassemble the 
torn country was to elect strong 
leadership. But at what cost? The 
streets may be safer now, but prisons 
no 
longer 
distinguish 
between 

criminals and political activists 
who oppose al-Sisi’s regime. As the 
government 
supposedly 
invests 

billions of dollars on projects to 
restore 
the 
economy, 
Egypt’s 

infrastructure and public services 
are collapsing. Even as the faith in 
the democratic system was restored 
after the revolution –– since Egypt 
saw unprecedented voter turnout 
and multiple parties on the ballot for 

the first time in generations –– this 
hope only lasted for a year under 
former President Mohamed Morsi 
before Sisi’s military coup –– which 
amassed near-unanimous support 
and ended any hope of political 
representation. Sisi learned his 
lesson from the events of Jan. 25 and 
worked harder to stifle any attempts 
of revolution. Unfortunately for him, 
the youth took their own notes.

The next step is to wait. The youth 

must wait for an opening to return to 
the square after learning from their 
previous mistakes. The revolution of 
2011 was the first sign of the power of 
new ideologies and tolerance amongst 
younger generations, but they didn’t 
have the experience that only comes 
with time on their side. The last thing 
they should do is lose hope because, 
even if they can’t see it yet, they are 
now at an advantage. So they should 
remain optimistic and never forget 
how Kefaya, a single word, held so 
much power. This is the opportunity 
of a complete revamp of society, to 
make it better and to say Kefaya to 
oppression.

T 
 

he news of how a group 
of people on Reddit used 
shares of GameStop to 

outmatch a Wall Street hedge fund 
has not only captured national 
attention but has also started an 
ethics conversation about hedge 
funds and the stock market. 
However, private citizens are not 
the only ones using questionable 
strategies to make money in 
stocks. Over the past few years, 
this issue has gained widespread 
attention due to a number of 
lawmakers who have engaged 
in ethically dubious trades. 
This has raised significant 
concerns 
among 
watchdog 

groups and the general public 
and has led to calls for greater 
regulation of stock trading 
among members of Congress.

For many years, there was no 

law explicitly preventing members 
of Congress from trading on 
congressional knowledge. Members 
of Congress could use privileged, and 
therefore asymmetric, information 
that they received to influence 
their stock trades. Finally, in 2012, 
Congress passed the Stop Trading 
on 
Congressional 
Knowledge 

Act, which prohibits members of 
Congress from using information 
that is not available to the public to 
influence their stock market trading. 

While 
this 
act 
was 
an 

important first step in addressing 
this issue, it did not go far enough, 
as demonstrated by the actions 
of many lawmakers recently. 
In February 2020, Congress 
received a briefing that outlined 
the severe threat of COVID-19 
on the country and the economy. 
Following this briefing, multiple 
elected 
officials, 
including 

former Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., 
made a series of controversial 
stock trades. Loeffler sold large 

stock holdings only days before 
the market had a large downturn 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
She also went a step further 
by investing in teleworking 
software, a field that became 
much more profitable during 
the pandemic. 

Not only did Loeffler make 

these 
controversial 
stock 

purchases but so did members of 
her family, including her husband, 
who is the president of the New 
York Stock Exchange. He bought 
many stocks in industries that 
would 
soon 
boom 
following 

the passage of the then-secret 
Coronavirus 
Aid, 
Relief 
and 

Economic Security Act. 

Former Sen. David Perdue, 

R-Ga., also has an eyebrow-
raising stock profile. In his six 
years in the Senate, Perdue 
made 2,596 stock trades. Many 
of these trades were of stocks of 
companies that fell under the 
purview of the committees that 
he sat on, such as the Senate 
Banking 
Committee. 
Having 

a 
senator 
holding 
stock 
in 

companies that they oversee as a 
member of a related committee is 
a major concern. 

The stock purchases by Perdue 

and Loeffler were flagged and 
investigated by the Department 
of Justice and the Securities and 
Exchange Committee. However, 
the 
cases 
were 
eventually 

dismissed, which is par for the 
course. Since the passage of 
the STOCK Act, no members of 
Congress have been prosecuted 
for using insider information on 
stock purchases.

While the passage of the 

STOCK Act was an important 
first step, the law is far too 
lenient to be effective. If we want 
to address the issue of members 

of Congress using their position 
and private information to enrich 
themselves through the stock 
market, there needs to be a more 
rigorous 
and 
comprehensive 

law put into place. There is 
a bipartisan bill called the 
Transparent 
Representation 

Upholding Service and Trust 
Act that would do just this. This 
bill would require members of 
Congress and their families to 
put their stocks in a blind trust, 
where a person has no control or 
knowledge of the assets or how 
they’re being managed.

Having members of Congress 

put their stocks in blind trusts 
would help to eliminate the issue 
of insider trading by our elected 
officials and promote greater 
trust in our legislative branch. 
There is much that we can do to 
help address this issue. You can 
advocate for stricter regulations 
with your elected officials. You 
can also hold your representatives 
accountable at the ballot box. 

This year in the Georgia Senate 

special election, Sens. Perdue 
and Loeffler were both assailed 
over their stock purchases by 
their Democratic counterparts. 
The election of Sens. Raphael 
Warnock, D-Ga., and Jon Ossoff, 
D-Ga, shows how voters have 
the power to hold members of 
Congress accountable for their 
misuse of private information in 
the stock market. 

Our government should work 

for us. We must all do what we 
can to hold our representatives 
accountable and ensure that 
our representatives serve us 
and not their own financial 
interests.

L

ate 
last 
year, 
news 

broke of the COVID-19 
B.1.1.7 variant reaching 

the United States, specifically 
Colorado. 
Much 
like 
last 

March, when the news was 
reported that the coronavirus 
had arrived in the U.S., panic 
and uncertainty quickly spread 
throughout the country. Now, 
nearly a month after the initial 
detection of the novel variant, 
over 600 domestic cases of 
B.1.1.7 have been reported by 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention; 13 cases are 
here in Washtenaw County. 

The 
county 
health 

department’s response to this: all 
University of Michigan students 
currently residing in Ann Arbor 
should “stay in place,” including 
not traveling within or out of 
the county, for two weeks. The 
Biden administration has also 
taken action, deploying country-
wide travel restrictions on those 
coming from countries that are 
heavily populated with new and 
potentially dangerous variants, 
including Brazil, Ireland, the 
United Kingdom and South 
Africa. However, there is a 
problematic exception to that 
ban: American citizens are still 
welcome back, even if they have 
traveled to those destinations. 

Although 
likely 
well-

intentioned, 
these 
travel 

restrictions are heavily flawed 
in their design. 

As 
we 
have 
seen 
an 

unfortunate number of times 
— over 26 million, to be exact 
— over the last few months, 
the virus does not care one bit 
about 
citizenship. 
Traveling 

to a location where the virus, 
especially a highly contagious 
variant of it, is rampant (or 
even just present) is a near-
perfect recipe for contracting 
it. Thus, excluding those that 
have traveled to these countries 
from travel restrictions simply 
because their legal documents 
read “U.S. citizen” is illogical. 
These Americans can and likely 
will contract the disease, too. 

Although 
not 
a 
perfect 

analogy, 
when 
Washtenaw 

County announced its stay-
at-home recommendation last 
week, they did not say Ann 
Arbor citizens could be excused, 
as doing so would be ineffective. 
The same should be expected 
from U.S. citizens on both a 
larger and more exhaustive 

scale. A strict quarantine, not 
simply an advisory to do so, 
should be mandatory for these 
individuals should they wish to 
return. 

The U.S. has been struggling 

with this concept since well 
before 
President 
Joe 
Biden 

took 
office. 
Look 
back 
to 

Thanksgiving 
or 
Christmas, 

only a few months ago, for 
example. 
Despite 
repeated 

advisories from the CDC to avoid 
travel, strict restrictions were 
not enacted and consequently, 
Americans traveled during the 
holidays in mass numbers. In 
the days and weeks following 
Thanksgiving this year, daily 
hospitalizations reached over 
100,000 and daily deaths were at 
about 3,000. Experts, including 
Dr. Anthony Fauci, note that 
this was likely a direct result 
of the influx of travel around 
the holiday. 

What is potentially even more 

troubling about this data is that 
most of the holiday travel was 
domestic. International travel 
thus proposes a whole new 
concern, if those other countries 
are 
experiencing 
problems 

with increased cases due to 
the novel variant. Travel for 
anyone during a pandemic will 
inevitably lead to a distribution 
of cases, including if it is 
international. 

 
This 
evaluation 
is 
not 

to say that Biden and his 
administration are not on the 

right track, but rather that 
they need to go full force 
with the ban, or at the very 
least with the conditions they 
impose on returning. 

Canadian 
Prime 
Minister 

Justin 
Trudeau 
seems 
to 

understand the need for harsh 
limitations, announcing earlier 
this week a much stricter set 
of restrictions. Upon arrival, 
travelers to our neighbor to the 
north must begin quarantine 
in a hotel, in addition to 
adhering 
to 
protocols 
for 

in-airport 
and 
pre-boarding 

PCR testing. Additionally, the 
destinations within the country 
for international travel have 
been restricted to four cities, in 
attempts to limit the points of 
entry for those with the virus. 
The U.S. should do the same, 
plain and simple.

Australia is even stricter. 

Among other policies, most 
notably, all arrivals to the 
country 
have 
a 
mandatory 

two-week 
hotel 
quarantine. 

After recording their first case 
in months this Sunday, the 
country promptly put the city 
of Perth under a comprehensive 
lockdown. 
Of 
course 
one 

must account for population 
differences but, for perspective, 
the U.S. is averaging at least 
100,000 cases daily. 

Imposing 
similarly 
strict 

travel restrictions, especially in 
the wake of a concerning new 
virus variant, could dwindle that 
figure significantly. It seems 
that for all countries that enact 
stricter policies like these, cases 
seem to be consistently down — I 
doubt this is coincidental. 

Enacting more comprehensive 

policies is going to anger a lot 
of people. The pandemic has 
been tiring, fatal and strenuous 
and the last thing many want, 
especially those who have yet to 
grapple with or see the severity 
of the virus themselves, is more 
or stricter restrictions. 

Unfortunately, though, until 

vaccines are fully distributed, 
restrictions are needed. Biden 
and his team cannot skimp 
out on how they impose them. 
Otherwise, we could soon be 
seeing yet another resurgence, 
this time with variants that 
could be doing more damage 
than the first one.

Travel restrictions only work if 

they are thorough, Joe

Keep Congress out of the stock market

From The Daily: America needs 
ambitious policy. The Democrats 

have to deliver.

As such, the Democrats need to 

be strategic with their legislative 
focus and get to work immediately. 
Wasting time on minute aspects 
of bills that the general public 
does not understand, as the 
Obama administration did with 
its economic relief measure, will 
cost them their positions. Biden 
must spearhead policy that is 
effective and has clear, tangible 
results for Democrats to have any 
hope of successfully maintaining a 
majority through the midterms.

Before beginning a conversation 

on the policies that will be crucial 
for 
the 
Biden 
administration 

to push, it is important to note 
the likely disastrous role of the 
filibuster 
in 
preventing 
the 

Senate Democrats from passing 
legislation. 

Recently, Biden has refrained 

from taking a strong stance on the 
filibuster — the popular Senate 
stalling strategy — and suspicions 
are arising among some Democrats 
that 
he 
may 
be 
a 
stronger 

supporter of the filibuster than 
they wish. In an ideal America, 
where bipartisanship flourishes 
flawlessly 
and 
democracy 
is 

perfectly embodied, Biden’s desire 
to negotiate and work with the 
Republicans without the removal 
of the filibuster might be a reality. 

But neither of the above exists in 

2021. If Biden fails to acknowledge 
that truth, then he can wave 
goodbye to any legislative plans for 
the coming months. His pursuit of 
political compromise is noble and 
admirable, but it is naive to think 
Republicans will agree to most 
aspects of a Democratic agenda. 

Simply 
put, 
Biden 
needs 

to end the filibuster for any 
progress to be made. 

Senate Minority Leader Mitch 

McConnell, R-Ky., recognizes the 
power of the filibuster and the 
harm that outlawing it could have 
on his party’s role in politics in 
the coming years, noting just 
before 
Biden’s 
inauguration 

that he planned to present an 
ultimatum to Majority Senate 
Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., 
and the Democrats. 

His warning: Keep the filibuster, 

or expect a lack of cooperation. 
Since then, following reassurance 
from a few Democratic senators 
that they would not endorse 
removing the filibuster, McConnell 
has calmed his stance.

Reformed health care, climate 

initiatives, economic restoration 
and much more are all crucial 
to the Biden agenda and are 
desperately needed by Americans 
living in a post-Trump United 
States. The filibuster can easily 
block all of them. 

At the moment, Biden’s plan 

of attack seems to be through 
executive orders, as both Donald 
Trump and Barack Obama did 
before him. But if the Republicans 
re-secure the presidency, any 
executive orders can be reversed. 
It happened with Trump, who 
quickly moved to dismantle many 
of Obama’s orders, and is now 
happening with Biden, who plans 
to do the same to Trump’s. For this 
reason, Biden and the Democrats 
cannot shy away from pushing 

their agenda in Congress by 
passing 
laws, 
arguably 
the 

most legitimate form of the 
legislative process. 

It is inevitable that Biden will 

face the destructive power of the 
filibuster in his policy plans. It is 
simply a matter of if he is willing to 
dismantle it or not. 

Apart from the set of usual 

responsibilities 
faced 
by 
U.S. 

presidents, 
the 
Biden-Harris 

administration has inherited a 
number of challenges this term 
unseen by prior administrations. 
In tackling them, we hope they 
enact policies that fully address the 
urgency of the pandemic while also 
working toward solving long-term 
issues like protecting Americans 
from further economic turmoil. 
In addition to mitigating the 
spread of COVID-19, Biden and 
Harris should also seek economic 
stability for all. 

With 
15,536 
lives 
lost 
in 

Michigan and more than 400,000 
dead in the U.S., coupled with a 
stunted economy and persistently 
high unemployment, the weight of 
each signature during these first 
100 days remains heavy. A poorly 
balanced response could lead to an 
additional 200,000 deaths in the 
U.S. alone. 

The 
Biden-Harris 
plan 
to 

beat COVID-19 is bold. But is 
it enough? With a seven-point 
strategy that values science, seeks 
the 
re-harnessing 
of 
national 

cooperation 
and 
emphasizes 

accessibility and inclusivity, our 
nation’s future is more hopeful 
than it was before this transition of 
power. With specific goals, such as 
vaccinating 100 million in the first 
100 days, bringing down COVID-
related costs and barriers and 
working to rebuild transparency 
and public trust in scientific 
institutions, the Biden-Harris plan 
has the potential to set America 
on the right track. Experts warn, 
however, that the plan may be 
lacking when it comes to funding, 
staffing and procedures regarding 
the new COVID-19 variant, SARS-
CoV-2 B.1.1.7.

While 
the 
Biden-Harris 

administration 
is 
primarily 

responsible for enacting their 
seven-point strategy to address 
COVID-19, we must be equally 
committed to doing the work 
as a community. In Ann Arbor 
and Washtenaw County, if we 
want to save lives in our own 
neighborhoods, we must remain 
committed to recommendations 
made by public health experts, like 
wearing well-fitted masks outside 
of our households and following 
all guidelines from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention.

This pandemic will not go away 

on its own. Following mandates, 
enforcing travel restrictions and 
implementing 
common-sense 

economic 
measures 
will 
be 

equally important up until day 
101 and thereafter. Without 
follow-through 
from 
every 

community in the U.S. and a 
sense of personal responsibility, 
the advances made by Biden’s 
administration will falter.

Though we only sit at the tip 

of the iceberg that will inevitably 

consume 2021, November 2022 
and the midterm elections are just 
around the corner. The best way 
for Democrats to retain control of 
Congress in the 2022 midterms 
will be to govern like McConnell. 
That is: viciously, obstinately and 
without tolerance for dissent 
on important issues like the 
minimum wage or the filibuster 
— we are looking at you, Sen. Joe 
Manchin, D-W.Va. 

From 
a 
purely 
electoral 

angle, one critique of the Obama 
administration is that former 
President Obama governed in the 
long term. Yes, the Affordable 
Care Act proved to be a relatively 
popular piece of legislation in 
the long run, but in the short 
term, this nearly 2,500-page law 
did little to improve the electoral 
odds for Democrats during the 
2010 midterms. 

Democrats’ 
failure 
to 
pass 

visible policies that benefited their 
core supporters arguably led to 
Republicans taking the House in 
2010. Obama had much to show 
for his work, but most of it was too 
indirect to compel voters.

In contrast to the Obama 

administration, 
the 
Biden 

administration should focus first on 
the short term. Biden should push 
through those ambitious policies 
which will garner immediate 
approval from the public. An 
immediate, rapid-fire approach 
is the only type of administration 
that Biden can afford to have, 
because maintaining a governing 
coalition after 2022 is by no means 
guaranteed. Some examples of 
ambitious measures that have 
broad public support include a 
$15 minimum wage, marijuana 
legalization at the federal level and 
expanding government-sponsored 
health care plans. 

Outside of policy, as Democrats 

move into 2021, they may want 
to fortify their messaging — 
Republicans certainly will. Take 
U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn, 
R-N.C., who recently said, “I have 
built my staff around comms rather 
than legislation.” 

Whether Democrats are more 

or moderate or progressive, it is 
clear that their messaging has 
been faulty. Even if Biden delivers 
on many of his more ambitious 
campaign promises, it will be 
useless in the coming elections if 
Democrats can’t communicate in 
new and effective ways. 

For 
example, 
Secretary 
of 

Transportation 
Pete 
Buttigieg 

has 
made 
several 
successful 

appearances on Fox News, a 
notably conservative network. 
This could signal a welcome 
change 
in 
how 
Democrats 

conduct their messaging for the 
coming election cycle.

Democrats are not faced with 

the decision of either keeping 
control of Congress or passing 
ambitious policies. Those goals 
are one and the same. If Joe Biden 
wants to be a successful president, 
the only path that he can follow 
is one of aggressive action, be 
it on the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the dysfunction in our economy 
or in wrangling a grid-locked 
government.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY EDITORIAL BOARD

W

ith the election of President Joe Biden and Sens. Raphael 
Warnock, D-Ga., and Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Democrats now 
have control of the presidency, the House and the Senate for 

the first time in 10 years. But their majority is slim, and their control of 
Congress will likely end in two years, following the 2022 midterm elections.

n recent weeks, thousands of 
University of Michigan students, 
alumni 
and 
community 

members signed a petition demanding 
University Regent Ronald Weiser (R) 
be removed from his post for failing 
to unequivocally disavow the Capitol 
riot and the chain of events leading up 
to it. Though Weiser condemned the 
violence itself, he failed to account for 
how he, his colleagues in the Michigan 
Republican Party and the politicians 
he funds — one of whom was former 
President Donald Trump — stoked 
the fires of mistrust and faux-populist 
rage that led to this disgraceful event. 

One of Weiser’s connections to the 

riot is his soon-to-be co-chair of the 
Michigan Republican Party, Meshawn 
Maddock, who was at the center of the 
racist and anti-democratic campaign 
to overturn Michigan’s election results 
and who happened to organize the 
busing of protestors to the rally that 
became the insurrection. 

For Weiser to claim that Maddock 

didn’t incite the riot is to pretend 
that there is no connection between 
the movement to undermine the 
legitimacy of the election and the 
riot itself. It is to say Maddock is not 
responsible for a fire, despite pouring 
kerosene and handing out matches. 
It simply defies belief, and it is an 
instance of a U-M Regent excusing 
actions that contributed to a violent 
attack on our nation’s Capitol.

We write this op-ed to call Weiser 

to resign due to his fundamental 
conflicts of interest and immoral 
conduct regarding the Capitol riot. But 
we also write this op-ed to connect 
Weiser’s troubling links to the Capitol 
riot to the problematic nature of his 
relationship to the University, which 
far predates the events at the Capitol. 
We call on all of us, as members of 
the U-M community, to hold Weiser 
accountable. 
In 
particular, 
we 

believe the faculty at the ironically 
named Weiser Center for Emerging 

Democracies should be more vocal 
about the ways Weiser has worked 
to undermine democracy at our 
university and in the state of Michigan.

Professor Dan Slater, the director of 

the WCED, released a statement on the 
events at the Capitol. His statement is 
worth reading — it throws the tensions 
between the values of the Weiser Center 
and its namesake into sharp relief. Slater 
is clear that “to claim that the election 
was fraudulent or stolen is to betray the 
democratic foundations of our Republic.” 
Thus, from Slater’s own perspective, 
Maddock, a close colleague of the man 
who funds the center Slater heads, 
has betrayed American democracy. 
The WCED’s mission is to study “how 
democracies emerge and the conditions 
necessary for assuring and extending 
freedom.” Its namesake, however, is a 
man who actively works to undermine 
democracy, both in our country at large 
and at the University. The Graduate 
Employees’ Organization calls on Slater 
to issue a statement about the tension 
between the source of his funding and 
the admirable mission he undertakes 
through his important work. 

That Weiser would be implicated 

in this reprehensible series of events 
comes as no surprise to us at GEO. It 
has long been our position that it is 
completely inappropriate for Weiser, 
a major landlord in Ann Arbor and 
donor to the University, to sit on the 
Board of Regents. Weiser is the founder 
of McKinley Associates Inc., one of 
Ann Arbor’s biggest landlords. 

As Regent, he has significant 

input over the University’s budget. 
As the University has increased its 
student population over the past 
decade without building new dorm 
space, rental prices in Ann Arbor 
have skyrocketed. Weiser has likely 
profited 
handsomely, 
given 
the 

unfettered increase in the cost of 
living and housing. According to an 
online petition, the company raised 
their monthly rent by up to $200 in 

the summer of 2020, in the thick of the 
pandemic, despite having received $5 
to $10 million in low-interest, federally-
backed loans which may be forgiven. 

Over the summer, when the 

University made the questionable 
decision to bring undergraduates 
back to Ann Arbor for an in-person 
pandemic semester, Weiser’s profits 
from McKinley properties in Ann 
Arbor were potentially on the line 
should the students not return and 
leave his rental units vacant. 

Weiser’s assault on American 

democracy goes beyond his support 
of the far-right and financial interests 
as a landlord. As any scholar at the 
WCED would tell you, democracy 
means much more than simply voting. 
GEO sees ourselves as working at the 
intersection of two important sites of 
democracy: the University as a public 
institution and the labor movement 
as an expression of workers’ self-
determination. Weiser has insidiously 
worked to undermine both, and we 
believe it is incumbent on Slater and 
others at the WCED — if they are 
serious about “Reviving Democracy, 
Globally and Locally” — to comment 

on his role therein. 

The University’s standing as a 

democratic institution is seriously 
undermined by the unaccountable 
power Weiser wields as a donor. 
In our view, Weiser only has many 
millions of dollars to donate to the 
University since the top 1% have been 
undertaxed for decades. 

As tenants, many of whom line 

Weiser’s pockets with rents equalling 
half our salaries, we believe this money 
is not his to give away. That money 
belongs to the people of Michigan and 
should go to the University without 
Weiser getting to put his name on 
buildings or direct how it is spent. A 
university is not truly a public entity, 
and will not be directed to work in the 
public interest especially if it receives 
an ever-dwindling share of its funding 
from the state. Relying on private 
donations mans that the University is 
perversely incentivized to prioritize 
projects that would attract donations 
over those that are in the public 
interest. This shift to relying on private 
donations goes far beyond Weiser and 
ultimately undermines the University’s 
mission as a public institution. Weiser, 

in his triple role as Regent, mega-donor 
and landlord, exemplifies a troubling 
broader trend while at the same time 
existing uniquely beyond the pale of 
anything even resembling democratic 
accountability. This is fundamentally 
at odds with the mission of the WCED 
and, indeed, the University itself.

Weiser 
has 
also 
worked 
to 

undermine 
Michigan’s 
labor 

movement and, with it, workplace 
democracy. 
University 
professor 

Elizabeth Anderson has argued in 
her book “Private Government” that 
workplaces, where employees have 
no say in their management, are akin 
to dictatorships. Trade unions are 
one of the few bulwarks against such 
dictatorships and give workers a say 
in the decisions that govern their lives. 
Robust trade unions are a critical 
feature of any society that would claim 
the mantle of democracy.

Weiser, together with the DeVos 

family, worked for the campaign 
to pass so-called “Right-to-Work” 
legislation in Michigan, which has 
hamstrung the labor movement here 
and across the country. This was 
nothing less than a full-scale assault 

on democracy in Michigan. When 
the Editorial Page Editors reached 
out to Weiser for comment, he did 
not respond. In the conclusion of his 
statement on the Capitol riot, Slater 
eloquently 
and 
wisely 
asserted, 

“Democracy never finishes emerging. 
It is a set of actions, not a finished state 
of being. American democracy has 
always been incomplete. It has never 
worked for all of us. This week’s violent 
events show just how fragile and faulty 
our incomplete democracy is as well.” 

GEO could not agree more. 

Weiser’s place in the University is an 
affront to the principles that Slater 
and his colleagues at the WCED work 
to defend. We call on Slater and all 
those at the University whose work 
seeks to further the righteous cause 
of democracy to speak out against 
Weiser and join GEO in the fight for a 
truly democratic university — one that 
would serve the public interest and 
respect the rights of its employees to 
have a say in the management of their 
workplace.

M

ore than 1,100 students 
at Columbia University 
in New York City are 

refusing to pay tuition until the 
university lowers the cost by at least 
10% as students face another semester 
of mainly-online classes. Tuition for 
undergraduates this academic year 
is $29,460 per semester. In the fall, 
Columbia allowed fewer than 1,000 of 
its over 6,000 undergraduates to return 
to campus. This spring, roughly 1,800 
undergraduates will be on campus. 

The tuition strike, organized 

by Columbia’s chapter of Young 
Democratic Socialists of America via 
their Twitter account, also includes 
demands for increased financial 
aid, for the university to engage in 
good faith bargaining with campus 
unions, for defunding the university’s 
Public Safety and for providing 
increased economic opportunities 
and outreach to the neighborhood 
surrounding Columbia. Though not 
all students are able to participate in 

the tuition strike due to their financial 
aid situation, Willem Morris, a senior 
and organizer for Columbia’s YDSA 
chapter, told The Daily that there 
are thousands of students who are 
supporting the strike in other ways. 
Organizing, emailing administrators 
and pledging to withhold donations 
are some of the ways students on 
campus have gotten involved. 

On Jan. 29, Columbia’s YDSA 

chapter called for a national tuition 
strike. Howard University’s YDSA 
chapter 
announced 
they 
were 

similarly planning a tuition strike for 
the fall semester. The Columbia strike 
was inspired in part by the University 
of Manchester’s rent strike that 
resulted in a 30% reduction in rent. 

The demand for a 10% reduction 

in tuition is in line with the tuition 
discount given by many comparable 
institutions 
for 
the 
2020-2021 

academic year. American University, 
Georgetown University and Princeton 
University offered 10% off tuition while 

Williams College cut tuition by 15%. 

Already, the strikers have won 

some concessions, including increased 
financial 
aid 
payments. 
Billing 

statements issued by the university in 
December said that late fees would be 
suspended “to minimize the financial 
hardship” caused or exacerbated by 
the pandemic. However, some students 
who did not pay tuition in January 
were still assessed the $150 fee. 

The question of whether tuition 

rates should reflect the ongoing 
pandemic is not unique to Columbia. 
This past spring, some University of 
Chicago students also held a tuition 
strike, calling for a 50% reduction in 
tuition. The University of Illinois was 
set to increase tuition after an in-state 
tuition freeze between 2015-2019, but 
decided to hold off on the increase 
until the 2021-2022 academic year due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Students at the University of 

Michigan’s Ann Arbor campus will 
recall the 1.9% tuition increase for the 

2020-2021 school year passed back 
in June despite student advocacy. At 
the time, University Regents told The 
Daily that the increase would only be 
felt by those who could afford to pay it. 

At 
both 
Columbia 
and 
the 

University of Michigan, discussions 
about lowering tuition during a 
pandemic seem to circle the same main 
points. Students point out massive 
endowments that could be used to 
help them out during a financially 
precarious time. Administrators sigh 
and tell students that endowments 
aren’t just unrestricted rainy-day 
funds. On and on.

Really though, the pandemic 

has made it clear that we’re paying 
too much, always. As Morris said, 
the “price of higher education is 

completely detached from the 

quality of the education.” 

That’s not to say that both 

schools don’t offer high-quality 
education, but it is to point out 
that tuition rates are far outpacing 

inflation. If we were paying the 
inflation-adjusted tuition rate that 
a student paid in 2002, an out-of-
state student with fewer than 55 
credits would be paying $16,617 
per semester instead of $25,919. An 
in-state student would be paying 
$5,196, instead of $7,760. Is our 
education worth more now than it 
was in 2002? All signs point to no. 

Wages for new college graduates 

are barely rising. CBS reported that 
between 1989 and 2019, average wages 
for recent graduates rose less than half 
of one percent every year. That’s tough 
to chew on when staring down a 1.9% 
tuition increase. 

The University of Michigan, no 

doubt, attracts students based on its 
excellent reputation. But it also recruits 
students 
marketing 
the 
“college 

experience” — who among us doesn’t 
remember being told how many clubs 
the University offered during admitted 
student days? Without clubs and game 
days, it becomes clear that the “college 

experience” was a way to conceal 
the bloated tuition. If the college 
experience was more than that — 
more than just a shiny object to attract 
undergraduates — wouldn’t college 
cost less without it? 

This column is not about why and 

how college is so expensive. There are 
already plenty of articles about that, 
such as this piece in The Atlantic. 

This column is about one thing that 

might be done about college tuition, the 
burden of which is falling on students 
and on their families. What seems 
inevitable is that, as long as students 
will keep paying, tuition will keep 
rising. It is in that context that a tuition 
strike seems not only reasonable, but 
necessary. I’ll be watching closely 
as Columbia students fight for a fair 
tuition amount that is one tiny step 
closer to what their degree is worth 
and taking notes for the fall.

T

he other day I received an 
email. One of my friends 
from back home is a student 

at Azusa Pacific University in Azusa, 
Calif., and he wanted me to watch a 
lecture from his professor, Dr. Courtney 
W. Davis. I had no true indication as to 
why he wanted me to watch that video, 
specifically. I hit “play” and settled in 
for 20-plus minutes. 

Davis, who teaches communication 

management, claimed to be “skeptical 
of things that other people think 
are cool and amazing.” She states 
that she never had crushes on boy 
bands, dresses anti-trendy and rarely 
downloads the latest iOS update 
upon its release. Davis, in summary, is 
someone who is anti-hype.

As I listened to this way of 

thinking, I could not help but applaud 
the professor for her unwavering 
originality. Throughout life, there 
will always be a strong contingent 
of people that latch on to the latest 
trends, unconsciously submitting to 
the laws of groupthink. Moreover, 
these people sometimes base their 
happiness in the behaviors of others, 
surely an unhealthy action.

However, I reject Davis’s notion of 

rejecting “hype.” While it may be true 
that, yes, sometimes experiences do 
not live up to expectation, if it were 
not for such precursory anticipation 
and energy, how would anyone be 
motivated to do anything? We, as 
humans, love the build-up to a strong 
rush of adrenaline. Psychologically, 
this hormone rush is similar to the 

release of dopamine; physically, we 
feel as though we are superhuman 
because of the increased blood flow 
to our muscles. 

In the 1970s, psychologist Marvin 

Zuckerman, a professor at the 
University of Delaware, created 
a personality questionnaire that 
identified four types of sensation-
seekers. An article from The Atlantic 
describes the first three of them 
as people who look for adventure, 
people who seek new experiences 
and people looking for ways to lose 
their inhibitions. There are some 
easy actions that fulfill the last one, 
but the other two can go hand-
in-hand. Yet, what do these three 
behaviors have in common? Before 
they occur, they are preceded by 
“hype.” 

Davis, however, seems like the 

fourth type of individual: people who 
are susceptible to boredom. Did she 
never wait in line for concert tickets? 
Refuse to go to the movie on opening 
night because Rotten Tomatoes said 
it was bad? Decide to go to class on 
senior skip day? 

These are often labeled as essential 

human 
experiences 
by 
society, 

but not for the events themselves. 
They are sensational because of 
their respective buzz — the eager 
anticipation of personal enjoyment. 

For this reason, I must express 

my sympathy for Davis. Perhaps, as 
Zuckerman concludes, she craves 
individual novelty. To her credit, 
Zuckerman notes that the payoffs of 

these four sensations are the same. 
While her character is undoubtedly 
authentic and she appears to be a kind 
individual — the two traits that are 
perhaps most important in this world 
— I wish she would buy into the hype, 
if only a little bit. 

In fairness to Davis, I had similar 

tendencies early on. I would scoff 
at those who went to the beach 
every summer afternoon or dressed 
identically in Nike or Patagonia, 
the two apparel lines that basically 
sponsor my hometown. I didn’t 
even try Chick-Fil-A until a year 
after a location opened twenty-five 
minutes from my house — a mistake 
I gravely regret.

Yet, at a certain point, I grew tired of 

watching on the sidelines — I wanted 
to try new things. When I think about 
how my life would’ve been different if 
I had never embraced the anticipatory 
excitement of my experiences, I 
probably wouldn’t have experienced 
them in the first place. I wouldn’t have 
immersed myself in homecoming 
week, sports seasons or the limited 
senior festivities I partook in. If I 
wasn’t enthusiastic about spending 
fall Saturdays in Ann Arbor growing 
up, I probably would not have been as 
motivated to come here. I wouldn’t be 
writing this column.

N

ame one thing that Reddit 
users 
infatuated 
with 

Elon Musk and Twitter 

leftists have in common. Did you 
guess a hatred of Wall Street? If 
you did, I applaud you. Because 
we’ve witnessed something truly 
interesting this week. I don’t pay 
much attention to the stock market, 
but even I heard about the insane 
crowdfunded 
effort 
in 
short-

squeezing to thwart the effort of the 
firms shorting GameStop stock. The 
stock for GameStop, a brick-and-
mortar chain of video game retailers, 
was at a price of $17.25 and in a period 
of stagnation on Jan. 4. 

By Jan. 31, it was at a staggering 

price of $325, a 1,784.06% increase in 
value. It was an absolute dumpster fire, 
with people on both sides lamenting 
losses and reveling in the victory of 
improbable gains. One of the firms 
that was attempting to short the stock, 
Melvin Capital, lost more than $4.5 
billion. This week has been so absurdly 
tumultuous for the stock market 
that the troubles even reached the 
executive office, with President Joe 
Biden and Federal Reserve Chairman 
Jerome Powell debating how to 
approach this reported catastrophe.

Now, how are we supposed to 

interpret this insane string of events? 
It’s a good indicator that the general 
opinion of Wall Street has turned 
sour and that their ever-present 
hypocrisy is on display for everyone 
to see. It’s a clear sign that the stock 
market is an abstraction, completely 
separate from the material well-being 
of the American people. 

What’s shorting, you may ask? It’s 

a practice many investment firms 
engage in, which is essentially betting 
on the price of a stock falling. A 
common “copypasta,” a block of text 
that people copy and paste around the 
internet, is being shared that explains 
shorting in terms of apes, snakes and 
banana prices. But for our purposes, 
it’s basically borrowing stocks, selling 
them to force the price down, then 
buying the stock back at a lower price 
to reimburse the loan and pocketing 
the difference. It’s a slimy operation 
that hinges on the failure of people’s 
livelihoods. 

I’ll give a quick debriefing on 

the actors at play. Reddit is a social 
media of sorts — a collection of 
online forums that specialize in 
many different topics. One of these 
subreddits is r/wallstreetbets (WSB), 
and they describe themselves in their 
About Community page as if “4chan 
found a bloomberg terminal.” It’s a 
pretty apt description — a bunch of 
hyper-insular young men that are 
crass and brazen in both their speech 
and their investments. They think the 
“stonks” meme is still funny by proxy 
of Elon Musk using it on Twitter, 
which is all I really have to say. 

Recently, 
they 
noticed 
a 

few 
investment 
firms 
shorting 

GameStop. In all their brazen lunacy, 
they decided that they would short-
squeeze the companies. It worked, 
amazingly, and has many scrambling 
to find a way to minimize losses. Elon 
Musk even joined in on the fun, using 
his status as an idol for many who use 
Reddit to bolster WSB’s efforts.

However, 
despite 
their 

reprehensible 
predilections, 
they 

have caused Melvin Capital to 
lose billions in assets, along with a 
staggering $19-billion loss for the 
multitude of firms interested in 
shorting GameStop. In turn, these 
companies have made a mad dash to 
protect their assets and find any way 
to stop people from investing. 

Robinhood, 
an 
application 

for trading at the stock market, 
controversially stopped its users from 
trading GME nearly instantly after 
the stock shot up. As of now, as some 
sort of concession, they allow their 
users to trade only one stock of GME 
at a time; a handful of other stocks are 
also limited.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange 

Commission put out a statement on 
Jan. 29 saying “the Commission will 
work to protect investors, to maintain 
fair, orderly, and efficient markets, 
and to facilitate capital formation. The 
Commission is working closely with 
our regulatory partners, both across 
the government and at FINRA and 
other self-regulatory organizations, 
including the stock exchanges, to 
ensure that regulated entities uphold 
their obligations to protect investors 

and to identify and pursue potential 
wrongdoing.” To many, this seems 
like a way to cater to both sides, or to 
side with the investment firms rather 
than the individuals.

This entire debacle has really 

shown to everyone the sham that 
is the market. Sen. Ted Cruz, 
R-Texas, and U.S. Rep. Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., 
shared 

discourse about this on Twitter, 
seemingly sharing the anti-firm 
sentiment. What seemed like a 
moment where the two agreed 
took no time to dissolve, however. 
But their sentiments seemed to be 
similar. 

Firms have been manipulating 

the market for decades — the 
SEC even admitted so during the 
2008 financial crisis. The status 
of the stock market is completely 
separated from the actual material 
struggles of most Americans. We 
saw this especially clearly last year, 
with the COVID-19 pandemic 
obliterating jobs and unemployment 
skyrocketing to 14.7% in April. In 
December, 
unemployment 
was 

6.7%, still nearly doubled from 
January of that year at 3.6%. 

Despite this, the S&P 500, an index 

of the most profitable stocks from 
500 American firms, displayed an 8% 
year-to-date gain in September 2020. 
There is virtually no connection 
between the health of investment 
firms and the material conditions 
Americans have to endure every day.

Discourse has shown that this 

isn’t even a partisan issue. If Sen. 
Cruz can try and piggyback off 
the sentiment of Rep. Ocasio-
Cortez, then perhaps there’s a 
kernel of truth within the object of 
contention. Since the success of this 
unprecedented and decentralized 
effort, I guarantee we’ll see more 
grassroots efforts to turn the stock 
market on its head. We shouldn’t let 
Wall Street feed off the American 
economy like a parasite, festering in 
its own greed and hubris. 

We’re riding this thing to the 

moon, whether we want to or not.

I 

recently noticed the growing 
stack of books on my desk 
and 
was 
overcome 
with 

disappointment and discouragement. 
There were now eight books stacked 
on top of each other, all of which I had 
started but not finished. The hardest 
part of acknowledging these books 
was that I actually enjoyed them all 
and still wanted to finish them. So 
why hadn’t I? 

During school breaks, visits 

home 
and 
especially 
during 

quarantine, reading is a hobby I 
turn to for learning, relaxation 
and escape. But when I returned 
to campus, I often found myself 
blaming my course load or social 
schedule for leaving me no time 
to read. After checking my daily 
screen time and discovering that, in 
the past week, I had been spending 
over two hours every day on social 
media and virtual entertainment 
applications such as Netflix and 
YouTube, I knew a lack of free time 
was not the problem. 

The importance and benefits of 

reading have been repeatedly praised, 
by both my teachers and my parents 
all throughout my upbringing. Still, 
I could count the number of friends 
I have that read consistently at the 
University of Michigan on one hand. 
According to a 2018 Bureau of Labor 
Statistics study, reading for pleasure in 

the United States has decreased more 
than 30% since 2004 to a low of 19%. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 

levels 
of 
anxiety, 
depression, 

loneliness and stress have increased 
in the student body. Ross sophomore 
Samantha Bakes, who began reading 
a chapter of a book every night before 
going to bed during quarantine, 
explained, “Reading has helped give 
me routine and also made me feel 
more purposeful. I read a lot of self-
improvement books and books about 
religion so that I can try to focus on 
bettering myself instead of feeling 
defeated and helpless by things out of 
my control.” 

Research on the benefits of 

reading shows that leisurely reading 
can reduce symptoms of depression 
while improving overall well-being. 
There has also been a correlation 
found between lower levels of 
stress and reading for pleasure. 
While benefits also include a better 
understanding 
of 
self-identity, 

improved empathy, reductions of 
dementia symptoms and more, the 
advantages are much more likely 
to be seen when the reading is for 
pleasure. Reading assignments for 
school or work do not provide the 
same benefits as a book you choose 
yourself. 

LSA sophomore David Kinane, 

who claims to have not read for 

pleasure 
since 
middle 
school, 

expressed that he feels as though 
“reading is a time investment that 
does not guarantee enjoyment since 
I might not like the book. It is much 
more likely that I will like a YouTube 
video so it is easier to do that.” 

Choosing a book to read can feel 

like a larger commitment and risk 
than watching videos. However, the 
satisfaction of finishing a good book 
or chapter is personally much more 
rewarding. Further, people who 
use technology before going to bed 
instead of reading report less sleep 
and are more likely to feel the need to 
find time to sleep during the day. 

Relaxing and unwinding before 

going to bed is a large part of most 
people’s daily routine. The form of 
entertainment you choose impacts 
your sleep, contributing to mental 
health and overall well-being. LSA 
sophomore Anna Haase explained, 
“I feel like you get a different type 
of entertainment than from movies 
or television because it’s more 
intellectually stimulating and there is 
more to get out of it.”

Both Haase and Bakes shared 

that they complete all of their school 
readings, which takes them around 
four hours a week. Neither generally 
struggle with school readings unless 
it happens to be an especially boring 
textbook chapter. On the other 

hand, Kinane explained that though 
he should be doing four hours of 
reading for school each week, he 
usually spends less than ten minutes 
a day on course work readings. 

Reading is shown to improve 

attention span and is a skill that can 
be improved by reading more. By 
reading more for pleasure on topics 
that you are interested in, your 

language and interpretation skills 
can improve, and the practice can 
help with actual academic assigned 
readings, easing the stress and 
overwhelming feelings that long 
reading lists often bring students. 

Making the effort to incorporate 

reading for pleasure this semester 
into your daily life may improve 
aspects of student life and health 

that the pandemic has worsened. 
Developing 
habits 
takes 
time 

but reading a chapter or flipping 
through book pages for 15 minutes 
a day is a small and accomplishable 
step that can make a large impact on 
your semester.

I

n 
the 
2020 
Democratic 

primaries, an unlikely and 
unique 
candidate 
arose: 
Andrew 

Yang. Yang, a former businessman 
and entrepreneur, ran to highlight the 
important issue of automation and 
the subsequent job loss associated 
with it. His cornerstone policy plan 
was to guarantee a universal basic 
income to all citizens over 18 in the 
United States — he proposed $1000 
a month to all eligible recipients. My 
reservations lie in how the poorest of 
Americans, whom proponents of this 
plan claim to support, would actually 
be worse off due to this program.

While Yang brings a lot of 

progressive thinking to the issues 
of automation, his ideas about UBI 
can best be described as libertarian 
in 
nature, 
since 
they 
would 

diminish government safety nets for 
individualized ones. The hallmark 
of libertarian ideology is that the 
role of the government is to enable 
individuals to make their own choices, 
which a UBI does effectively. Yang 
advocates for creating a value-added 
tax and critically “consolidating some 
welfare programs” then using that 
funding for the UBI. 

A VAT is described by Yang 

himself as a tax taken at each point 
the product switches hands through 
the supply chain. These VATs exist 
in numerous countries already, but 
not currently in the U.S. This in and 
of intuitive proposal that could work 
to generate large amounts of revenue 
for the U.S. The problem lies in the 
specifics. Yang himself claims that 
this policy would generate about $800 
billion for the Freedom Dividend, his 
policy name for UBI. In reality, the 
Committee for a Responsible Federal 
Budget found that it would only yield 
about $600 billion, which is merely 
one-fifth of the yearly cost of the 
program he proposes: $3 trillion. 

Additionally, even Jim Pugh, a strong 

proponent of a UBI and co-director of 
the Universal Income Project, admits 
that “because the Freedom Dividend 
is funded through a regressive Value 
Added Tax, costs will rise for low-
income Americans, leaving some of 
the most vulnerable Americans worse 
off than before.” It is clear that a VAT 

alone would disproportionately hurt 
poorer Americans, especially if they 
do not reap the majority of subsequent 
benefits. Between this issue and 
concern over Yang’s claims about the 
plan’s financing, there is ample reason 
for concern.

Every study of UBI, and even Yang 

himself, admits that to have a UBI, 
there would need to be some marginal 
tradeoff with welfare programs. The 
problem with this is that welfare 
programs usually directly target 
poorer Americans and, in general, 
have been found to provide monetary 
benefits upwards of the $12,000 a 
year that Yang has proposed. 

On net impact, this would leave 

the poorest and most vulnerable 
Americans in a worse position. 
Economists Hilary Hoynes and Jesse 
Rothstein studied a hypothetical 
UBI in the U.S. and agreed — 
finding that a UBI in the U.S. would 
disproportionately 
advantage 

“childless, non-elderly, non-disabled 
households” when compared to 
existing welfare programs, and 
would direct more money to middle-
income households, rather than low-
income ones that need it most. 

This is because a majority of 

means-tested programs currently 
target 
the 
most 
disadvantaged 

populations, whereas a UBI would 
replace that with a program that 
distributes relatively equal sums to 
all, therefore failing to account for 
already-existing differences. 

Melissa Kearney and Magne 

Mostead of The Aspen Institute agree 
again by defining a few important 
findings. First, they agree that 
existing safety net programs provide 
more money to poor Americans than 
Yang’s UBI-style welfare plan would. 
Second, they found that the only way 
to fully fund this proposal would be 
to completely eliminate several major 
welfare programs, including Social 
Security, Medicare and Medicaid. 

Dwyer Gunn, a contributor to the 

Pacific Standard, finds that elderly 
individuals annually receive about 
$17,400 from Social Security and 
$12,900 in Medicaid and Medicare 
benefits. Cutting those to zero and 
replacing it with $12,000 a year 

would put these individuals at a major 
disadvantage. Additionally, she finds 
that this program will put poorer 
kids further behind their wealthier 
counterparts in schooling and career-
areas. 
Removing 
or 
decreasing 

funding for programs like the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program or the Earned Income Tax 
Credit would disadvantage poorer 
children, 
especially 
since 
early 

childhood nutrition and education 
are essential for later success. 

Children in the U.S. are already a 

low priority for the government, and 
putting them further behind is not what 
we need as a society. While Yang does 
not support these harsh cuts to welfare, 
he does support welfare cuts to some 
extent, including a potential substantial 
cut to food stamps. Regardless, it is 
important to understand what the 
experts have found to be feasible, rather 
than taking Yang’s theoretical policy 
positions at face value. 

It is important to recognize that 

we, at some point, must yield to the 
vulnerable communities in our country 
and do what is in their best interest, 
rather than our own. Cutting welfare 
programs that low-income individuals 
rely on for survival and replacing them 
with inferior alternatives is not the 
right way to go about dealing with the 
very serious problems of automation 
and technological job displacement 
that Yang brings up. Instead, we must 
look to solutions that work for all of 
America, or at the very least those most 
impacted by these problems. 

While Yang and his campaign seem 

to be coming from a well-intentioned 
background of helping everyone 
equally, after analyzing the totality of 
the evidence, it is clear that middle-
income and rich Americans would be 
better off, whereas poorer Americans 
would be hurt by a UBI. 

Instead, we could use the money 

that 
Yang 
proposes 
garnering 

from a VAT and reinvest it into the 
communities and individuals who 
need it most, thus getting closer to 
the end goal of equity and equal 
opportunity for all.

DIMITRA COLOVOS | COLUMNIST

“

30 minutes prior to your 
appointment 
please 
take 

either 600mg of Ibuprofen or 

1,000mg of Tylenol.” These are the 
pre-appointment instructions for the 
insertion of an intrauterine device. 
Why are women expected to take only 
slightly higher doses of over the counter 
narcotics to handle a procedure on the 
most sensitive part of their body? The 
answer is years of sexism in medicine. 

In private life, women are still not 

encouraged to talk openly about sex, 
and are subject to intense criticism 
and name-calling if they do. Even 
today, 
women 
being 
excessively 

open and comfortable with sexuality 
is 
considered 
embarrassing, 
yet 

men compare “body counts” only 
to encourage raising the number 
higher. In a society where women 
cannot discuss their sexual lives and 
partners without facing judgment, the 

gynecologist’s office should be a safe 
haven.

Stepping into the office is already 

an uncomfortable feeling due to the 
multiple greeters and receptionists 
a woman will encounter before the 
private visit with her gynecologist. 
But once the doors are closed, this 
discomfort only escalates with the 
unique feeling of full vulnerability 
while in stirrups. Going in for an IUD 
appointment is extremely anxiety-
inducing, and there isn’t much 
conversation about this form of birth 
control to make women feel more 
comfortable during this appointment. 

Ironically, 
gynecology 
was 

considered a man’s work until recent 
years. Though the percentage of female 
OB-GYNs and gynecologists increased 
from 7% in 1970 to approximately 59% 
in 2017 now, the history of sexism in 
hiring women into this occupation 

has perpetuated into a lack of truly 
understanding the female body and 
the psychological and physiological 
effects of different appointments. 
Without a personal experience with 
the female reproductive system, male 
gynecologists created a precedent 
of normalcy for women enduring 
physical pains as an expected aspect of 
their experience in the doctor’s office. 

Furthermore, studies indicate that 

“male physicians take medical illnesses 
more seriously in men than women,” 
which could lead to an explanation as 
to why women’s pain is generally less 
believed by physicians even after the 
demographic shift of this occupation. 
This lack of understanding between 
the doctor and patient creates not only 
pain in the office, but also normalized 
anxiety outside of it.

Birth control is extremely important 

and relevant to many college students, 

especially with the convenience of 
University Health Services on campus. 
Yet, with the gaining popularity of 
this method of birth control, there 
is no growing comfort in having the 
procedure done. Many students may 
choose to undergo this procedure 
due to the predominant sex culture 
in college. Of course, this relates 
back to the expectation of women in 
heterosexual relationships to carry 
a strong burden of birth control over 
the male partner, potentially forcing 
women into painful procedures. 
Though an IUD is not the only option 
for birth control, it is known to be one 
of the most effective methods, having a 
99% success rate. 

Why is a woman’s comfort 

not prioritized during such an 
appointment? 
Women’s 
rights 

outside of the gynecologist’s office 
should apply inside as well, though 

many 
women 
find 
themselves 

nervous to attend appointments 
due to the discomfort experienced 
during them. This lack of care for a 
woman’s well-being and ease during 
an important appointment further 
proves the lack of consideration for 
women’s rights and the continued 
sexism women experience due to 
different standards to which they are 
held. 

Every source I spoke with to 

provide 
a 
personal 
experience 

described the insertion of an IUD as, 
“the worst pain of their lives.” A close 
friend of mine was almost sent to the 
hospital for profuse vomiting due to 
the physical pain she experienced 
after 
the 
insertion. 
Newsflash, 

600 mg of Ibuprofen or 1,000 mg 
of Tylenol doesn’t do much when a 
plastic or metal device is inserted 
roughly seven centimeters into the 

most sensitive part of a female’s 
body. Yet, women are told this is 
normal, that this is the only step 
they can take beforehand in order 
to relieve themselves of some future 
discomfort. 

This notion of women being able 

to endure this amount of pain has 
only been continued through years of 
sexism propelled through the medical 
system, and it only continues to be 
normalized with the acceptance of 
birth control in general. Although 
this method is extremely effective, 
women should not have to choose 
effectiveness through unavoidable, 
intense pain.

UMich Esports benefits from recreational 

sports status, virtual features

The 
COVID-19 
pandemic 

has sidelined most aspects of 

typical club sports, derailing 

practice 
schedules 
and 

throwing competitions out the 

window. The UMich Esports 

team, though, felt right at home 

with the switch to a virtual 

landscape.

The impact of the pandemic 

on 
the 
outside 
world 
has 

pushed many into the virtual 

space in which esports teams 

have 
traditionally 
resided, 

potentially 
boosting 
the 

validity 
of 
esports 
in 
the 

minds of some fans moving 

forward. This can be seen with 

the increase in popularity of 

Twitch — a platform where 

fans can watch professional or 

recreational esports online — 

streams during the spring and 

summer.

That boost in popularity has 

led to Michigan esports earning 

recreational sports status.

In its first year under the 

jurisdiction 
of 
Michigan’s 

recreational sports department, 

the Wolverines have still been 

able to power through their 

schedule 
full 
of 
practices, 

scrimmages and tournaments — 

with more yet to come. Training 

and competing remotely had 

been a staple of Michigan’s 

teams prior to the pandemic, 

ever since they lost access to 

their usual meeting spots when 

they became a recreational 

sport over the summer.

Those 
meetings 
used 
to 

take place at the Ross School 

of Business, where the team 

began as a student organization 

in 2015 under the direction of 

founder Tony Yuan, a former 

Michigan student. Now hosting 

teams across 10 different games 

— including “Counter-Strike: 

Global 
Offensive,” 
“Rocket 

League” 
and 
“League 
of 

Legends” — the team’s growth 

into a recreational sport came 

at the cost of their typically 

held rooms at Ross. 

While functioning has proven 

easier for the Wolverines than 

many other club sports, teams 

across its 10 different games 

have lost the opportunity to 

host in-person events that drew 

in new players and fans.

Recruiting new members for 

each game occurred virtually 

this 
season, 
and 
although 

networking 
online 
paled 

in 
comparison 
to 
previous 

in-person events, Michigan was 

still able to draw in community 

members 
and 
competitive 

players to its Discord server.

Outside of bolstering their 

ranks, the Wolverines want 

to create an effective virtual 

presence. With so many teams 

and players to keep track of, 

communicating 
schedules 

and scores to fans has proven 

difficult.

A virtual community isn’t the 

only home Michigan is trying 

to build. In a post-pandemic 

world, the Wolverines want to 

acquire an in-person facility 

where 
teams 
can 
practice, 

compete and, most importantly, 

bond.

“It is very helpful to have 

a space on campus where we 

could go and our teams could 

compete in the same room 

and just help build that team 

chemistry in a way that simply 

speaking through Skype or 

a Discord voice chat doesn’t 

really promote,” the team’s 

vice president, sophomore Seth 

Izzard, said.

 

That chemistry used to be 

created through the team’s 

in-person local area network 

events 
where 
casual 
and 

competitive 
players 
would 

meet up and play a variety of 

games together. The ongoing 

pandemic forced Michigan to 

cease holding those meetups.

Building connections can be 

the deciding factor between a 

skilled roster and a winning 

team. Those communication 

skills 
and 
familiarities, 

something Michigan’s teams 

utilize frequently, can make a 

difference when facing other 

skilled teams.

“We’re 
almost 
like 
a 

family,” senior Ryan Foley, 

Rocket League director, said. 

“We all respect each other, 

we’re all really good friends, 

even in real life, so it makes 

it a lot better. (In Rocket 

League) 
maybe 
we’re 
not 

the best players, but we’re 

always one of the best teams 

because we have really good 

communication, and we enjoy 

playing with each other.”

In 
order 
to 
fund 
a 

physical home to build those 

relationships, the Wolverines 

hope to find funding through 

their newly-christened status 

as a recreational sport. Future 

sponsorships 
and 
budgeting 

will now be coordinated with 

University support.

In the meantime, Michigan 

looks forward to another perk 

of joining Rec Sports: Giving 

Blue Day. The online event, 

set to take place March 10, 

is a 24-hour donation drive 

where 
alumni, 
companies 

and community members can 

support 
Michigan 
student 

programs.

Michigan 
also 
now 
has 

automatic access to Festifall, 

something the team can use to 

its advantage when in-person 

recruiting events are safe again.

While stuck at its virtual 

home for the time being, the 

momentum 
the 
Wolverines 

have built has created feelings 

of pride and hope for their 

members. 
Some 
even 
look 

forward to a future home in the 

athletic department as a varsity 

sport, a long-term goal of the 

Wolverines.

“Esports 
viewership 
is 

skyrocketing, but it’s still 

not at the same level as your 

football, or your basketball or 

your soccer (games),” Izzard 

said. “And that has actually 

been helped by the COVID-

19 situation because so many 

people are at home and the 

traditional 
sports 
aren’t 

competing at the same level.”

While future growth plays 

into 
the 
team’s 
planning, 

UMich Esports also wants 

to make its impact felt right 

now.

Izzard said that he hopes 

breaking down the stigma 

surrounding esports will drive 

improvements 
surrounding 

the 
team’s 
community 

events. With more resources 

and a permanent home, the 

Wolverines can show that 

esports is a legitimate team 

worthy of one day attaining 

varsity status.

UMich Esports is finding ways to grow its brand in spite of the 
pandemic.

‘M’ flips Benny, 
adds three DTs on 

National Signing Day

After 
an 
Early 
Signing 

Day headlined by talent on 

the offensive side of the ball, 

Michigan addressed its biggest 

need on Wednesday, defense, 

with three signees on National 

Signing Day.

All 
three 
signees 
were 

defensive tackles, a position 

at 
which 
the 
Wolverines 

have little depth. That lack of 

depth showed in the defense’s 

performance this year, and 

in the early period, Michigan 

failed to add a single player at 

the position.

However, 
the 
Wolverines 

were able to flip four-star 

Rayshaun Benny — now the 

sixth-rated 
commit 
in 
the 

class — from Michigan State, 

where he had committed after 

the Spartans beat Michigan in 

October.

The Wolverines also flipped 

three-star Ikechukwu Iwunnah 

from Colorado and added a late 

commitment, four-star George 

Rooks.

After Jim Harbaugh inked 

an extension in December, he 

revamped his staff, going much 

younger and fortifying both 

the offensive and defensive 

staffs with more recruiters. The 

National Signing Day returns 

seem to vindicate that strategy. 

According to 247Sports, new 

co-defensive coordinator Mike 

Macdonald was one of the 

primary recruiters for Iwunnah, 

while 
Benny 
and 
Rooks 

were primarily recruited by 

defensive line coach Shaun Nua 

and co-offensive coordinator 

Sherrone Moore.

Even after a 2-4 season, 

Michigan was able to land five 

of the top 15 players in the state, 

according to the 247Sports 

composite. Following Benny’s 

last-minute 
flip, 
none 
of 

those 15 players signed with 

Michigan State. (Penn State 

had four, Northwestern two, 

and Alabama, Notre Dame, 

LSU and Nebraska secured one 

each.)

With the new additions, the 

Wolverines have the 10th-best 

2021 class in the country and 

second-best in the Big Ten 

behind Ohio State. The class 

ranks as the fourth best in the 

Harbaugh era.

Shaun Nua landed three commitments along the defensive line after 
Michigan failed to sign a defensive tackle in December.

Steve Shields accomplishes his goal as development director

Over his 30-year relationship 

with the Michigan hockey team, 

Steve Shields has held a lot of 

different titles — player, coach, 

director — but, through it all, 

one thing has stayed the same: 

He’s been looking out for others.

That role, though, goes back 

much further than 30 years. 

Shields was adopted from a 

foster home when he was just a 

couple months old. Growing up 

with his adopted parents and 

sister in North Bay, Ontario 

— the Canadian equivalent to 

Michigan’s Upper Peninsula — 

Shields never considered being 

adopted to be anything out of 

the ordinary. It wasn’t until he 

was older that he realized his 

experience differed from most 

of his friends and had most 

likely shaped who he is today. 

“When you’re an adopted kid, 

you have that innate feeling, that 

instinct that you were left or 

abandoned at some point when 

you were very young,” Shields 

says. “When you’re growing up 

adopted, there’s an instinctual 

feeling that you don’t have that 

unconditional love. So what do 

you do when you don’t have that 

unconditional love? You please 

people so they don’t leave you. 

You can come to terms with that 

as you grow up if you deal with 

it, but it never really goes away.” 

As an adopted child, Shields 

feels he’s much more aware 

of how others perceive him. 

While that can have negative 

consequences, he thinks it’s the 

reason he’s always gravitated 

towards those who need help, 

something he does every day 

in his role as director of player 

development. 

***

When Shields graduated from 

Michigan, he knew very little of 

life outside of hockey.

As 
a 
goaltender 
for 
the 

Wolverines, 
Shields’s 
world 

revolved around practices at 

Yost Ice Arena and his classes. 

He graduated in 1994 with a 

bachelor’s degree in education, 

but very few practical skills 

that would help him get a job. 

When asked if he was focused 

on his future at that age, Shields 

laughed.

“No, absolutely not. … I was 

solely focused on playing hockey. 

I had no idea that hockey could 

end in a day. Telling me that at 

that age would mean nothing to 

me.”

The 
opportunity 
to 
play 

professionally allowed Shields 

to put off his future a while 

longer. He played 12 years after 

college — 10 in the NHL — but 

eventually retired in 2006. 

By that time, Shields was in 

his mid-thirties with little idea 

of what to do next. 

“I didn’t know anybody,” 

Shields said. “First of all, I didn’t 

have any idea how to network. I 

didn’t know what my options 

were, I didn’t know what my 

interests were and I didn’t know 

what I was good at.”

He 
spent 
a 
couple 
years 

working in software development 

and bouncing between different 

pet projects, but he found himself 

drawn to positions where he 

could help others. Shields has 

always felt an innate ability to 

sense when someone is stressed 

or unhappy, and he wanted to put 

that skill to use. 

Two years after leaving the 

world of hockey, he jumped back 

in with a new purpose: helping 

players reach their full potential 

on the ice. Shields worked as 

an assistant coach under then-

Michigan 
Tech 
coach 
Mel 

Pearson before joining Florida 

Panthers’ coaching staff in 2013 

as a goaltending consultant. 

In 2015, Shields returned 

to Ann Arbor to assist with 

the goaltenders under then-

Michigan coach Red Berenson. 

And as he worked with more 

and more players over the years, 

he started to see a hole in the 

system, the same hole that had 

left him feeling so unprepared 

years earlier. 

While the University offers 

countless resources for student-

athletes, Shields found that his 

hockey players weren’t taking 

advantage of them. 

“When 
a 
student 
athlete 

comes to Michigan, they have 

two things that are mandatory: 

They have to go to class, and 

they play on their team,” Shields 

said. “The hole in the system 

is that anything that has to do 

with their future in the business 

world or life after Michigan is 

optional for them when they 

have time.”

Here, he saw his opportunity 

to help. 

He pitched his idea, first 

to Berenson, then to Pearson 

when he replaced Berenson. 

Pearson approved, and Shields 

became the program’s first 

director of player development 

— a position he’s held for the 

past two years. 

He 
works 
closely 
with 

athletes and advisors, serving 

as a “touchpoint” between the 

two to make sure the hockey 

players don’t get lost in the 

shuffle. Michigan’s Athletics 

Career Center consists of only 

two staff members for 900 

athletes.

While his job isn’t to prepare 

the players for any certain 

career, his goal is to get them 

to think about a future outside 

of hockey — a Herculean task 

when you consider most of his 

players are primarily focused 

on making it to the NHL. 

“For how many of those guys 

is it going to work out where 

they play in the NHL, retire 

from hockey and never have 

to worry about finances or a 

career?” Shields said. “One or 

2% of the time.”

Shields 
starts 
small. 

Initially, he just asks the 

younger players to identify 

interests and skills they have 

off the ice. He knows that it’s 

unrealistic to get any of these 

players to focus on a career, 

but he hopes his work will get 

them a little more prepared for 

whatever life has in store after 

graduation. The hockey team 

was the first at Michigan to 

have all their players make a 

resume.

As much as Shields still loves 

the game of hockey, he’s happy 

with his current role and can’t 

imagine a return to coaching. 

To be a coach, you have to put 

the total wins and losses about 

all else, something Shields 

doesn’t think he can do. 

“The score of our games is 

probably the least important 

thing to me,” Shields said. “So, 

does that make me coaching 

material long term? Probably 

not.” 

But 
being 
“coaching 

material” isn’t Shields’s goal. 

Now, he wants to help players 

access resources that he didn’t 

have.

For the past two years, Steve Shields has served as Michigan’s Director of Player Development, helping players 
prepare for life outside of hockey.


After leading the Michigan men’s 

lacrosse team to three consecutive 

championships at the club level, John 

Paul was gearing up to prepare the 

Wolverines for their first season as 

a part of Division I varsity lacrosse. 

Now competing in the upper echelon 

of collegiate lacrosse would bring 

new challenges for Paul and his 

players, but they were committed to 

charging forward in hopes of build-

ing a brighter future for the program.

Starting a Division I program on 

a year’s notice isn’t exactly the easi-

est thing to do.

For “Team One,” as Paul dubbed 

it, Michigan had numerous pieces 

to try to put together on a narrow 

timeframe.

First, the Wolverines needed to 

find Division I opponents. The Big 

Ten didn’t exist in NCAA lacrosse 

until 2015, so Michigan signed 

on as an affiliate member of the 

then-prominent Eastern College 

Athletic Conference for the 2012 

season, joining traditional rivals 

Ohio State and Penn State, as well 

as lacrosse stalwarts like Denver 

and Loyola.

Second, the Wolverines needed 

to find a space to operate on Michi-

gan’s athletic campus. Although the 

team now had greater access to the 

University’s and athletic depart-

ment’s vast resources, including a 

strength and conditioning coach, 

more reasonable practice field 

times and academic support, it 

didn’t have its own stadium yet. 

In the meantime, Team One had 

to use other programs’ facilities 

when they weren’t occupied. For 

practices and games, the Wolver-

ines continued to use the football 

team’s Oosterbaan Field House 

as they did during the club days. 

They also now played in Michigan 

Stadium and used the baseball 

team’s visitors’ locker room for big 

matchups. Paul had a trailer in a 

nearby parking lot that served as 

his “office.”

At the top of Paul’s priority list, 

though, was mentally and physical-

ly preparing himself and his players 

to compete in Division I lacrosse. 

Having never played or coached 

beyond the club level, Paul didn’t 

have quite the pedigree or con-

nections that his future opposing 

coaches did. Until this point, he had 

largely pulled his coaching career 

up by his bootstraps.

“I had to learn a lot of it on my 

own,” Paul said. “I was a student 

of the game. I ate up everything I 

could.”

For advice on coaching a Divi-

sion I sport, Paul tapped into Mich-

igan’s rich network. He became 

close with coaches like Erik Bakich 

and Carol Hutchins, often stopping 

by baseball and softball practices to 

watch and talk shop with them. 

“I don’t think you have to just 

pigeon-hole yourself into your 

sport,” Paul said. “Obviously Michi-

gan has a whole stable full of coach-

es, so I would learn as much as I 

could from my friends who I was 

surrounded with, other coaches in 

other sports.”

From a roster perspective, since 

the 2012 season would commence 

without bringing in a single Divi-

sion I recruit, Team One was com-

posed solely of players carried over 

from the club days. While the team 

was tight-knit and accustomed to 

playing at a high level of lacrosse, 

culturally, becoming varsity 

brought new challenges to over-

come and expectations to meet.

“I think culturally we had to 

become a little more disciplined,” 

Yealy said. “Even in the club 

days, as a non-varsity sport, we 

weren’t always under the watch 

of the athletic department and the 

administration, so that required 

some adjustment to make sure that 

guys were always doing the right 

things.”

After sitting at the top of the 

food chain for several years in the 

MCLA, members of Team One 

now had to manage battling with 

some of the best lacrosse players in 

the entire country. To compensate 

for such a daunting talent gap that 

lay ahead, Paul put an enormous 

emphasis on practicing fundamen-

tals to ensure that Michigan was 

always the more technically sound, 

disciplined team on the playing 

field.

“As a club program, we won on 

what was a combination of talent 

and coaching,” Yealy said. “When 

we got to the Division I level, we 

were still a talented team, but we 

were no longer the most talented, 

that’s for sure. … So there was an 

incredible focus on fundamentals, 

because what we couldn’t afford 

was to be the least talented and also 

be the sloppiest. There was a real 

focus on back to basics.”

The odds would be significantly 

stacked against the Wolverines in 

their first couple seasons. It was 

going to be very, very difficult to 

win individual games, let alone 

enjoy the same kind of success 

attained at the club level.

To lead the charge, though, 

Michigan had offensive leaders 

like Yealy — now a fifth-year senior 

— and junior Thomas Paras. After 

finishing the 2011 season first and 

second on the Wolverines in points 

with 69 and 66, respectively, Yealy 

and Paras were consistent contrib-

utors and active leaders who knew 

how to compete and energize their 

teammates.

And above all, players like Yealy 

recognized their role in laying the 

groundwork for the future of Mich-

igan lacrosse. They were grateful to 

have the opportunity to play at the 

highest level of the sport — some-

thing they didn’t think they would 

ever get to experience during their 

time with the Wolverines.

“It was great to continue playing 

with that set of guys, play at the 

highest level of collegiate lacrosse, 

and try to build the foundation for 

something that would last longer 

than any of us as individuals ever 

would,” Yealy said. “To be some-

thing that was bigger than us.” 

***

On Feb. 12, 2012, Michigan 

played its first game as a Division 

I program against Detroit Mercy. 

The Wolverines stood toe-to-toe 

with the Titans for the better 

part of the contest, heading into 

halftime tied, 5-5, thanks in large 

to a pair of goals each from Yealy 

and sophomore midfielder Doug 

Bryant. Detroit Mercy went on to 

score eight of the next 12 goals in 

the second half, though, to secure a 

13-9 win.

Michigan dropped its next four 

matchups as well. On March 4, the 

Wolverines tasted victory for the 

first time in varsity program his-

tory following a commanding 14-4 

win over Mercer, in which Paras 

tallied six points and Yealy and 

Bryant each netted hat tricks.

The sweet flavor would only 

remain on Michigan’s tastebuds for 

so long, though — the Wolverines 

lost their remaining eight games to 

finish their inaugural season with a 

lowly 1-13 record. 

Although Michigan expected to 

lose games early on in its transition, 

it was still jarring for Paul and his 

players to deal with defeat on such 

a tilted scale. After going 76-2 the 

previous four seasons, the Wolver-

ines did a complete about-face in 

just one year.

“(It was) really hard,” Paul said. 

“When you have a bunch of guys 

who are used to winning 90% of 

their games, if not 100%, and then 

going to winning none of their 

games, that’s hard. Culturally, 

that’s really hard.”

Added Yealy: “Nobody was 

thrilled about losing and I think 

that did weigh on people’s minds. It 

was frustrating in the moment for 

sure. Going week to week practic-

ing and itching to get that first win, 

and then once we got the first one, 

itching to get more wins. It was 

definitely trying.”

Michigan’s initial struggles 

weren’t necessarily a signal of 

imminent failure, though. Instead, 

they were indicative of who the 

Wolverines were competing 

against right off the bat. Rather 

than slate his players against lack-

luster opponents to pile up some 

easy wins, Paul elected early on to 

put them against some of the best 

teams in all of Division I, including 

No. 9 Loyola, as well as out-of-con-

ference foes like Harvard and No. 5 

North Carolina. 

Michigan played the 39th most 

difficult schedule in the NCAA 

in 2012. Around the same time, 

Richmond took an easier route in 

its inaugural season, playing just 

the 63rd most difficult schedule 

in 2014. As a result, the Spiders 

notched a 6-11 record in their first 

year as opposed to the Wolverines’ 

1-13 in 2012. 

But rather than give Michigan 

a false confidence of what it was 

like to play at the varsity level, Paul 

figured that, in the long run, it was 

best to throw the team into the 

deep end. If the Wolverines want-

ed to someday be one of the best 

programs in Division I, they had 

to know what those kinds of teams 

looked like and how they operated 

up close.

***

Partially due to Paul’s commit-

ment to playing a strenuous sched-

ule, Michigan’s growing pains 

carried over into its next couple 

seasons as well.

After leading the Wolverines in 

points in 2012, notching 26 goals, 

Yealy left a gaping hole in Michi-

gan’s offense when he graduated at 

the season’s end.

To fill it, Paul turned to the 

recruiting trail, where he found No. 

7 Canadian prospect Kyle Jackson. 

Growing up in Sarnia, Ontario, just 

under a two hour trip on I-94 from 

Ann Arbor, the crafty offensive 

weapon played high school lacrosse 

at the Hill Academy, a forceful 

independent school that has sent 

Canadians to the best lacrosse col-

lege programs in the United States 

since its inception in 2006.

While some of Jackson’s 

teammates elected to go to more 

established East Coast schools like 

Loyola and Lehigh, Michigan was 

the perfect place for him. Eager 

to go somewhere he could start 

all four years and contribute to a 

program’s grassroots development, 

Jackson knew that he could have 

an instant positive impact on the 

Wolverines as a member of their 

inaugural recruiting class. He also 

wanted to show his fellow Canadi-

ans that the future of lacrosse lay 

not in its East Coast strongholds, 

but in programs like Michigan 

that had benefited from the game’s 

westward expansion.

“Going to the Midwest and 

having Michigan open those doors 

for a lot of people, it allowed other 

players to have an avenue to go that 

wasn’t just the East Coast,” Jackson 

said. “I wanted to go somewhere 

and show, not (just) the top-tier 

players, but (also) your mid-level 

lacrosse players, your bottom-tier 

lacrosse players, that you don’t just 

have to go to a powerhouse school 

in order to be successful long-

term.”

And so Jackson did exactly those 

things.

In 2013, his freshman campaign, 

Jackson led the team in points and 

goals, with 26 and 17, respectively. 

While attackman Ian King took 

over his role as chief goal scorer in 

2014 and 2015, Jackson became the 

program’s all-time career leader in 

points and goals in his senior year, 

racking up a cumulative 113 and 88, 

respectively.

While talented newcomers 

like Jackson and King racked up 

incredible individual statistics and 

accolades, Michigan still struggled 

to get tallies in the win column. In 

2013, the Wolverines once again 

went 1-13, and in the subsequent 

three campaigns, they never 

eclipsed more than five wins in a 

season.

Culturally, according to Paul and 

Jackson, this dichotomy created an 

interesting dynamic between the 

tenured club players who remained 

with the team and the fresh, high-

ly-touted recruits like Jackson and 

King. Although everyone got along 

in the locker room and had fun 

together in their spare time, the 

disappointment and frustration 

of losing — compounded by the 

natural evolution of the roster’s 

composition — sometimes breeded 

competition and animosity across 

its castes.

“Without deliberately saying 

that we weren’t the most liked on 

the team when we came in, I think 

that’s the best way of phrasing it, 

because there were players that 

had played for the club team for at 

that point three, almost four years,” 

Jackson said. “You had people that 

were on teams that were extremely 

successful at the club level and now 

you got all these young kids coming 

in as freshmen, trying to take their 

spots and really ultimately doing 

so.”

In a way, though, Jackson saw 

all of this as a necessary step in 

Michigan’s growth as a Division I 

lacrosse program. If the Wolverines 

were going to become a legitimate 

force in the sport, he believed that 

they were going to have to push 

one another and compete with one 

another

As Jackson entered his upper-

classman years and the last remain-

ing club players graduated, he 

became the pace car that dictated 

the direction of the program for 

years to come. The club days were 

over, but just as Michigan’s seniors 

did in 2007 to elevate the club team, 

Jackson began to take the next step. 

Players like Yealy that came before 

him had set the foundation for the 

program. 

Now, he was building it up.

“We literally (were) building 

the framework for what Michigan 

lacrosse is today and (will be) in 10 

years and 20 years and 50 years,” 

Jackson said. “And you can always 

look back on that and know that 

although you didn’t have the suc-

cess in the world at the beginning, 

you built the framework. You built 

the structure that that house is now 

built on, and people can move for-

ward with and they can take it and 

make it their own.”

***

In 2017, although Jackson had 

since graduated, the Wolverines 

began to reap the benefits of the 

team culture he helped cultivate 

during his time at Michigan. His 

enthusiasm and fervor had been 

contagious, and it now permeat-

ed throughout the Wolverines’ 

roster, particularly in players like 

midfielders Brent Noseworthy 

and Decker Curran — who were 

budding freshmen during Jackson’s 

senior year and began taking on 

larger roles. 

“They just took more ownership 

of what the team could be,” Paul 

said. “They weren’t as much just 

waiting for the coaches to tell them 

what to do. The leaders of the team 

were taking more charge of the 

younger guys and saying, ‘Look, 

this is the way it’s gonna be.’ And 

it was just shifting from a team of 

reactionary people to a team of a lot 

more proactive guys.”

Michigan got off to a hot start, 

winning six of its first seven games, 

with its sole loss coming from No. 

5 Notre Dame. Halfway into the 

season, the Wolverines took down 

No. 10 Pennsylvania, 13-12, to pick 

up their first win against a ranked 

opponent.

While Michigan was subse-

quently swept in Big Ten play — a 

misfortune of playing in what had 

become the NCAA’s most compet-

itive conference — it finished the 

2017 season with an 8-6 record. The 

program had its first ever winning 

season and made its first appear-

ance in the top-20 rankings, reach-

ing as high as No. 18 in the Maverik 

Media Poll. Behind King, who set 

the Wolverines’ new record for 

points in a season with 47 his senior 

year, Noseworthy and Curran fin-

ished second and third on the team, 

with 43 and 25 points, respectively, 

in breakout sophomore campaigns.

“We were just getting started 

there,” Paul said. “It certainly 

wasn’t there yet. (But) you (saw) 

where the team (was) going. We 

had the kind of start we were look-

ing for that year, and that didn’t 

come because we were more talent-

ed, it came because the guys were 

really starting to push each other 

harder.”

Added Noseworthy: “We were 

starting to develop confidence. I 

think we showed some glimpses of 

what a great program could look 

like. It was good to have the feeling 

of some big wins.”

After five years of trudging 

through losses and molding the 

team’s culture, it finally looked like 

Michigan was moving into the next 

phase of establishing itself as a solid 

Division I program.

The athletic department likely 

shared the same sentiment that 

the Wolverines were on the brink 

of something. But upon the arrival 

of new athletic director Warde 

Manuel in 2016, there was some 

concern that Paul, whose contract 

was set to expire, had taken the 

program as far as he could. Despite 

an overall successful season in 2017, 

after witnessing several blowouts 

to ranked and Big Ten opponents — 

including a particularly transparent 

18-7 loss to No. 9 Ohio State prior to 

the football team’s spring game — 

perhaps Michigan needed a fresh 

start in order to start winning the 

big games.

On May 2, 2017, Manuel 

announced that the University 

would not be renewing Paul’s 

contract, thus ending his nearly 

20-year journey with the program.

As the man who had largely 

built Michigan lacrosse to become 

everything that it had ever been 

and everything it was at the 

moment, Paul was obviously disap-

pointed by the decision.

At the end of the day, though, 

Paul was finally content knowing 

that he had poured everything 

he had into the program and the 

players he loved from the instant 

he came aboard back in 1998. 

Through trials and triumph, he 

had given Michigan all that he 

could, and that was enough for 

him.

“I did this out of love for Mich-

igan and the program and not so 

much for any kind of career ambi-

tions,” Paul said. “I kinda stumbled 

and bumbled along for 20 years and 

came out the other end with what 

we had. And that’s how it kinda felt 

the whole time. I was just kinda 

latched on and rode it for wherever 

it went.”

Maddie Nolan making strides with 

Leigha Brown still out

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team had a hole to fill 

ever since junior wing Leigha Brown 

became ineligible for play due to 

COVID-19 protocols on Jan. 7, right 

before the Wolverine’s match-up 

with Nebraska.

Brown was an integral part of 

Michigan’s early success that led to 

a 10-0 start. Without her, Michigan 

has struggled to put points on the 

board and guard opposing teams’ 

perimeter threats. 

“I think the hardest part is 

learning to play without (Brown),” 

fifth-year senior guard Akienreh 

Johnson said after a win over Illinois 

on Jan. 10. “(Brown’s) such an 

offensive presence. She can really get 

any shots she wanted, whenever she 

wanted.”

But with Brown out, Michigan 

might have found their new bright 

spot in sophomore guard Maddie 

Nolan.

Nolan’s no stranger to stepping 

into big roles. Last season she 

contributed big minutes late in 

the season after multiple players 

sustained 
significant 
injuries. 

Her 
breakout 
game 
against 

Northwestern in the quarterfinals 

of the Big Ten tournament, with 13 

points and eight rebounds, made 

her a consistent substitute for tired 

guards early in her sophomore 

season. She’s a scrappy defender that 

made teams uncomfortable.

After a brief stint of junior guard 

Danielle Rauch trying to fill the spot 

left by Brown, Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico decided it was time to 

pencil Nolan into the lineup once 

again.

“Last year when we made our 

run in the Big Ten Tournament and 

when Kayla (Robbins) went down 

with her injury that she stepped in 

and really did a tremendous job for 

us,” Barnes Arico said after a win 

over Wisconsin on Jan. 14. “But I 

think it was just her getting back her 

confidence, or knowing that she had 

the green light.”

Nolan had only started one other 

time this season against Oakland, 

when Johnson went down with a leg 

injury the game before. Nolan added 

three points and nine rebounds 

against the Golden Grizzlies.

But in her second opportunity of 

the season, Nolan proved she’s more 

than capable of holding a starting 

spot. Against Wisconsin on Jan. 

14, she had 21 points — 15 of which 

came from beyond the arc. In the 

Wolverines’ final game before the 

two-week shutdown, Nolan had six 

rebounds and five assists. 

She brought a 3-point threat back 

to Michigan’s offense, something 

it missed without Brown. In the 

defensive end, Nolan uses her 

quickness to disorient other guards. 

Contributing on both sides of the 

floor, Nolan fills in the gaps.

“Last 
year 
gave 
her 
an 

opportunity to really play, and to get 

experience as a freshman,” Barnes 

Arico said after that same Wisconsin 

game. “Now her confidence is at 

another level. She’s a big strong 

guard, she defends exceptionally 

well, she rebounds well and she can 

shoot the ball and that really gave us 

an option from the outside.”

While Nolan can’t fully replace 

Leigha Brown, her performance 

shows that Michigan has many 

starting options. Nolan has the 

potential to grow into Brown’s 

shoes. And with Johnson and senior 

forward Hailey Brown graduating 

this season, the Wolverines will 

need replacements in the lineup. 

Nolan’s 
continued 
development 

will be necessary for sustaining the 

program’s success in the coming 

seasons.

With Leigha Brown out due to COVID-19 protocols, Maddie Nolan has stepped into the starting lineup and 
provided important contributions.

NCAA Football, NIL and a conversation with Denard Robinson

I’m on the phone with Denard 

Robinson, and I need to make an 

admission. I called him because of 

the news this week –– the kind of 

news that saves a very slow week 

when you have 

to turn in a 

column on 

Sunday night 

–– that EA 

Sports would 

be reviving its 

widely-beloved 

NCAA Football 

video game 

franchise. It 

won’t be this year, and it’ll be called 

EA Sports College Football instead 

of NCAA Football, but its release 

will mark the first new college foot-

ball game EA has made since 2013, 

when Robinson occupied the cover. 

I want to ask him about the 

dichotomy of being on the cover of 

a video game because of what he 

did as an unpaid college athlete. 

About what it’s like to be famous 

and unable to capitalize on your 

earnings potential and whether he 

thinks this news underscores the 

problem at hand.

But first I need to tell him: I’ve 

never played NCAA Football.

“Oh my gosh. Jesus,” he says. 

“What? Why not? So you never 

played NCAA, that’s what you’re 

telling me?”

Yup.

“This is bad. This is really bad. 

Who gave you the — come on, man. 

You gotta pick this game up. Do 

I gotta send this game to you and 

make you play it?”

Robinson, before he came to 

Michigan and played himself onto 

the cover, grew up the same way 

lots of people his age did: playing 

the game. He and his brothers 

would create players and try to 

win the Heisman Trophy, going 

through a four-year career then 

doing it again and again and again. 

He sounds the same way most 

people do when they talk about this 

game. It’s the sort of deep-rooted 

nostalgia that a new edition has a 

way of killing. When he got to be in 

the game, let alone on the cover, he 

thought it was the coolest thing in 

the world.

“Just to be one of the players on 

that — and it don’t even have my 

name, it just said 16 from Deerfield 

Beach, Florida,” Robinson said. 

“That just meant so much for my 

city, for me to represent my city. It 

felt unreal, you know.”

But the first part is the import-

ant part. It didn’t have his name 

because college athletes aren’t 

allowed to license their image for 

money. Instead, it had a nameless 

Michigan quarterback from Deer-

field Beach, Fla., with dreadlocks 

who wore #16 and ran the ball 

really well. 

When former UCLA basket-

ball player Ed O’Bannon sued the 

NCAA over his likeness being 

used without compensation in the 

same way, part of the effect was 

EA discontinuing the games. In 

the fine print of the announcement 

this week was a note that no player 

likenesses will be used in the new 

video game.

But by 2023, when the game is 

expected to launch, that decision 

might have nothing to do with 

O’Bannon v. NCAA. Twenty states 

have either passed or considered 

laws allowing student-athletes to 

capitalize on their image rights. 

Bills have been introduced at the 

federal level as well, with bipar-

tisan support, and the NCAA has 

started to lobby Congress not to 

vote the bills down, but only so 

it can have some level of control 

over what happens. In this respect, 

Democratic majorities in the U.S. 

House and Senate will likely make 

a bill more favorable to athletes if 

passed. 

Even if a federal bill isn’t passed, 

though, Florida’s bill goes into 

effect in July of this year. In the 

state of Michigan, a law passed in 

December and goes into effect in 

… 2023.

“College guys gonna need a 

union,” Robinson said. “And I say 

that because they’re gonna need 

someone to represent them. Cause 

somebody gotta be in that room to 

represent them. If it’s just NCAA 

people representing them, well 

then they’re gonna look out for 

the best for themselves. So I think 

somebody’s gonna have to be in that 

room to represent them and come 

up with some solutions.”

For a brief moment this August, 

it seemed like there was momen-

tum towards a union — or some-

thing resembling one — forming. 

A group of players including 

Clemson’s Trevor Lawrence and 

Michigan’s Hunter Reynolds went 

on social media and tweeted a 

proposal, asking to play the season 

with universally mandated safety 

protocols, the ability to opt out, 

retain eligibility and create a Col-

lege Football Players’ Association. 

Then-President Donald Trump 

seemed to endorse it.

Two of those demands — a sea-

son and eligibility retention — were 

met. A third, universal safety proto-

cols, didn’t quite happen, but each 

conference had its own set of proto-

cols. That last one? You don’t hear 

much about that last one anymore.

I tell Robinson my pet theory: 

That a majority of players would 

never choose to sit out games in 

the name of forming a union, thus 

the effort will always fizzle out. “I 

think that’s the truth,” he said. At 

Michigan, he and his teammates 

noticed people getting in trouble 

for selling shoes, shirts, tickets or 

anything else. “Of course we had 

that conversation,” he said, “but we 

never came up with a solution.”

Robinson thinks athletes “need” 

to get paid, but he isn’t closer to 

finding that solution than anyone 

else. A union and health insurance 

would be a good place to start, 

though. Thanks to a stint in the 

NFL, Robinson has insurance now. 

At Michigan, though, when his 

earnings potential was at its peak, 

he was always a bad injury away 

from all those dollars evaporating. 

So his brother paid for insurance.

“I’m thinking I’m gonna get 

drafted,” Robinson said. “But if I 

get injured in my last year, I won’t 

be able to see any of the money that 

I thought I shoulda seen when I 

was in college.”

He brings up the case of Mar-

cus Lattimore, a running back 

at South Carolina the same time 

Robinson was at Michigan. In 

his freshman year, Lattimore ran 

for 1,197 yards, but he had severe 

knee injuries his sophomore and 

junior years. He got drafted by 

the San Francisco 49ers, but never 

played an NFL game. “He was 

one of the best backs in South 

Carolina history,” Robinson said. 

“... He played three years, four 

years in college and never got to 

see his real earnings because of 

(injuries).”

Robinson, of course, has his own 

story. Because he had graduated 

before being on the cover — EA 

approached him about it right after 

the last game of his senior year — 

he could be paid for that. But the 

man who might have been the most 

marketable Michigan football play-

er this side of Charles Woodson left 

Ann Arbor with that being the lone 

endorsement to his name.

“This is true,” he said.

So does it bother him?

“No, no,” he said. “… I think 

everything happens for a reason 

in life.”

When Denard Robinson played in Ann Arbor, he wasn’t able to profit off of his fame; that is set to change in 2023 
as Michigan passed House bills 5317 and 5218 allowing college athletes to be paid for endorsements.

LOVE 
ISSUE
What does love mean to you?


Content warning: The following article 
contains discussion of sexual assault.
T

he old adage goes as fol-
lows: One of the most 
sacred places for a young 

woman is in the bathroom at a bar. In 
pre-COVID times, these sanctuaries 
were not only places for breaking the 
seal (or on a worse night, throwing 
up), but they were also a place of 
community — of drunk compliments 
on outfits, of shared insults over shit-
ty men, of exchanged hair-ties and 
tampons. In the women’s bathroom, 
with the faint waft of puke and the 
floors sticky with beer, we find our-
selves free to be vulnerable and 
anonymous. We don’t know who is 
washing their hands in the sink next 
to us, but for some reason, we feel we 
can confide in them. We don’t care if 
they are in a sorority or not, if they 
are prettier than us or if they gave us 
a dirty look on the dance floor just 
minutes before — in that moment, 
we have shared solidarity.

It’s a common anecdote, and one 

that LSA junior Naya Alkhaldi and 

I were discussing over Zoom last 
Thursday afternoon. Naya, who is 
studying Political Science and Inter-
national Studies, was describing how 
she has felt that support between 
women fade when moving around in 
a world defined by the male gaze. And 
while we both recognized the analo-
gy of the bathroom as a safe space as 
too simplistic and situational to en-
compass the entirety of the female 
experience, we agreed that there is a 
truth to it.

“That male narrative is brought 

back in the picture as soon as you 
leave the bathroom,” Naya said. “And 
we kind of start judging girls, and 
the way we judge girls is always very 
male-centric, like, ‘Oh, she’s pretty,’ 
which is like … why does it matter, be-
ing pretty? It’s because men will want 
you more … like ‘Oh, she has a big butt, 
I want a big butt,’ but if men didn’t like 
big butts, no one would have f---ing 
cared about big butts.”

Indeed, many of our preconcep-

tions on how we should look and act 
as women are defined by what men 

want. In the modern feminist can-
on “The Second Sex” by Simone de 
Beauvoir, she describes the paradox 
and prison women are forced into 
through standards of physical beauty.

“The ideal of feminine beauty is 

variable; but some requirements re-
main constant; one of them is that 
since a woman is destined to be pos-
sessed, her body has to provide the in-
ert and passive qualities of an object,” 
de Beauvoir writes. “The most naive 
form of this requirement is the Hot-
tentot ideal … as the buttocks are the 
part of the body with the fewest nerve 
endings, where the flesh appears as a 
given without purpose … weighed 
down by fat or on the contrary so 
diaphanous that any effort is forbid-
den to it, paralyzed by uncomfortable 
clothes and rites of propriety, the body 
thus appeared to man as his thing.”

It’s an impossible state to be in, one 

that many young women are familiar 
with — the pressure to be, all at once, 
beautiful, well-dressed, thin but with 
curves, sophisticated and youthful. 
This is especially present in the col-
lege setting when compounded with 
academics and professional life (you 
should be the smartest and most suc-
cessful woman, too). More so, many 
women experience relationships for 
the first time in college, meaning it 
is on campus that we begin learning 
what is expected in love and sex.

I wondered how other cis women, 

specifically those who are attracted 
to men, experience love and sex at 
University of Michigan and if those 
interactions have lingering impacts 
on their self-esteem, aspirations and 
worldview. Do the bounds that de 
Beauvoir described actually exist, and 
are they as deeply rooted in women’s 
struggles for equality as we claim? 
Is college really a place where these 

behaviors are formed and reinforced 
— especially since the University is a 
largely liberal campus?

To find out, I spoke with six wom-

en from varying backgrounds, all of 
whom are either straight or bisexual. 
Lesbian women are also under the 
scrutiny and rules of the male gaze, 
and this narrative is important and 
necessary to explore, but since this ar-
ticle focuses on the romantic and sex-
ual relationships between men and 
women, the lesbian experience will 
not be fully realized here. Any refer-
ence to “women” will imply straight 
or bisexual cis-gendered women. 

Times have changed since de 

Beauvoir wrote “The Second Sex” 
in 1949, but the problems that wom-
en face still endure, even in our pre-
sumed Ann Arbor liberal bubble. The 
heavy questions de Beauvoir asked in 
her landmark book are still echoed 
today, and I felt that weight of won-
dering in my conversations with Naya 
and the five other women:

“How, in the feminine condition, 

can a human being accomplish her-
self? What paths are open to her? 
Which ones lead to dead ends?” de 
Beauvoir asked. “How can she find 
independence within dependence?”

***
It’s 2021. Women make up close to 

half of the labor force. We earn more 
college degrees than men. We have 
a woman of color, Kamala Harris, as 
vice president. As de Beauvoir puts 
it, “many of us have never felt our fe-
maleness to be a difficulty or an obsta-
cle; many other problems seem more 
essential than those that concern us 
uniquely.”

Sex and love: Women at U-M 
reflect on lessons learned

BY MAGDALENA MIHAYLOVA, STATEMENT CORRESPONDENT

ILLUSTRATION BY MAGGIE WIEBE
ILLUSTRATION BY MAGGIE WIEBE


W

hen 
I 
think 

of 
Valentine’s 

Day, I think of a 

hard-shelled, cherry-red, Sa-
ran-wrapped version of love 
that bores cavities in your teeth 
and sits on your tongue like the 
aftermath of a bad French kiss.

I think of the time in middle 

school when I made a list of 
my “future boyfriends” using a 
pink piece of construction pa-
per and red crayola marker, and 
I think about the freckle-faced 
love interest who picked it up 
and then forced me to confess 
my feelings for him the next 
period. I think of the hundreds 
of elementary worksheets van-
dalized by my semi-psycho rep-
etitions of “Mrs. Grace Smith,” 
adopting the surname of which-
ever dimpled specimen I decid-
ed I was in love with on that 
given weekday. I think of entire 
lunch periods spent with other 
pony-tailed fourth graders pas-
sionately debating which Drew 
was the more “attractive Drew” 
in our class (I oscillated teams 
constantly). 

There was always a certain 

level of embarrassment that 
came with that hallowed day 
in mid-February, when teach-
ers and real, grown adults fash-
ioned love into platonic paper 
crafts, like you hadn’t spent ev-
ery second of your adolescence 
thinking about just that: boys 
and crushes and this Drew or 
that one. 

Much like the blaring beat of 

silence that comes when teach-
ers announce they’re expecting 
a baby — each student realizing 

what step was taken to get to 
that bit of news — the launch 
of private, romantic affairs into 
public consciousness is awk-
ward. And in middle school, 
Valentine’s Day was a whole 
day of just that.

I first experienced the sick-

ening embarrassment of being 
crushed on publicly in fifth 
grade, when a pale and freck-
le-faced boy named Liam con-
fessed his love for me via a 
stack of valentines. The mess 
of red paper slips, overflow-
ing like confetti from my glit-
tered Valentine’s Day box, was 
an adorable stream of boyish 
consciousness. His endearingly 
scribbled handwriting read:

“I like you so much, Grace.”
“I like your eyes, Grace.”
“Do 
you 
like 
me 
back? 

Choose: Yes or No.”

“Will you be my valentine?”
It should have been my dream 

come true: A boy was pouring 
his heart out for me — he was 
maxing out my Valentine’s Day 
box in just the perfect way, my 
desk showered with enough 
notes of affection to make a sin-
gle girl cry.

But I could not have been 

more appalled. All I wanted to 
do was tear each valentine one 
by one, ridding myself of any 
speck of Liam’s affection that 
remained on that desk. 

Maybe it was a mixture of 

embarrassment, confused feel-
ings and being confronted with 
a tsunami of real-life boy atten-
tion I had yet to receive as an 
adolescent. But either way, the 
essential truth is this: The in-

troduction of the private, Liam 
and my enduring flame of love, 
into the public, Mrs. Parker’s 
fifth-grade classroom, was a 
wildly uncomfortable affair.

And thus, we arrive at the 

dreaded Valentine’s Day par-
adox: the idea of a collective 
day when private celebration is 
thrusted into public conscious-
ness and punctuated by obtru-
sive spells of commodification 
all the while. It’s brutal. 

Originally founded in Chris-

tian and ancient Roman tradi-
tions, the romantic sentiment 
associated 
with 
Valentine’s 

Day was made tangible begin-
ning in the 15th century, when 
written notes were traded to 
convey affection. Then, in the 
1840s, a woman named Esther 
Howland, now revered as the 
“Mother of the Valentine,” be-
gan to mass-produce those cov-

eted greeting cards, finally lib-
erating us from the burden of 
having to put our thoughts to 
pen and paper. 

Around this same time, Val-

entine’s Day was in the process 
of being rebranded. An 1849 
edition of Graham’s American 
Monthly harnessed the day’s 
full capitalist potential: “St. 
Valentine’s day...is becoming, 
nay, it has become a national 
holyday.” 

And thus, Feb. 14 had turned 

into a whole new woman: Sud-
denly, drugstores were stocked 
with pastel-colored valentines, 
a Bostoner invented the be-
loved Necco candy hearts and 
holiday merchandise in an ar-
ray of blushed tones littered 
store windows.

W

hen I was 10, my fam-
ily packed up our 
quaint little Royal Oak 

home into boxes and embarked on a 
treacherous journey up Woodward 
Avenue, the oldest highway in the 
state of Michigan. It took us a whole 
15 minutes to reach our destination: a 
brave new world that, a decade later, 
I now regard as my childhood home. 
Well, our childhood home — Josh, my 
brother, lived there too.

When choosing between the house 

on the corner and one nestled in half-
way down the dead-end block, my 
parents opted for the peace and quiet. 
It was the right choice. There were 
awesome kids living across the street 
to play with when we were younger 
and more when I was old enough 
to babysit. But when Josh and I first 
moved in, our favorite thing about the 
new house was the ice cream store on 
the corner of the block.

Little people live in little worlds, 

so we did not yet know that “the ice 
cream store” had a name. All we knew 
is that we wanted our parents to take 
us down for a $2 cone. We made up 
skits and wrote ourselves songs to 
perform for our parents to convince 
them. Josh and I knew from a young 
age how to join forces to fight for the 
common good. I’m not sure what it 
means that our weapons of choice 
were song and dance.

Talking to other University of 

Michigan students, I came across 
many stories that sounded just like 
Josh’s and mine. As kids, we devised 
our own unique forms of entertain-
ment bolstered by the support of 
those around us. If we were sur-
rounded by other kids around our age 
all the time, then we were inclined to 
come up with some pretty creative 
ways to combat the boredom.

For many, those other kids were 

their siblings. Recent studies have 
shown that about 80% of Americans 
have at least one sibling. LSA senior 
Andrew Kohrman has two.

Korhman described his siblings’ 

early relationship as “hierarchical.” 
Each of the three of them occupied a 
different role. The youngest, his sis-
ter Sydney, could always get him and 
his brother Alex in trouble with their 
parents. The oldest, Alex, was tasked 
with conceiving the ways they’d pass 
the time, including one game which 
can only be described as an extreme 
form of dodgeball.

“The game that (Alex) invented for 

us was he would hit these balls at us 
and we would try to dodge them, and 
I don’t know how that came to be as 
we enjoyed it,” Kohrman said. “But he 
was the one that was always inventing 
the games for us to play, and he was 
the one that was always in charge of 
changing the rules in his favor.”

In childhood, Kohrman came to 

appreciate his siblings as role models, 
teammates and confidants. For many 
of us, this introduction sets the foun-
dation for an ever-evolving relation-
ship that matures, as we do, over time.

My parents met in law school, so 

naturally in our house, you didn’t get 
anything you didn’t need without 
justification. This meant that Josh 
and I had to put on skits to earn ice 
cream and do chores to earn allow-
ance. When we grew older and could 
no longer exchange our cuteness for 
cash, I walked down to the same ice 
cream store Josh and I used to fre-
quent as kids for a job. When Josh 
was 14, he did the same.

At this point, he and I had settled 

into our own lives. We have an awk-
ward age gap: Being three years apart 
meant that after I graduated fifth 
grade, we didn’t go to the same school 
for six years. We were on different 

schedules and at different points of 
our lives. Between dance team for me, 
rock climbing for him, newspaper 
for me, musical theater for him and 
homework for the both of us, work-
ing at the ice cream store was the only 
time we got to see each other.

We each had a window into each 

other’s lives again. Not only that, but 
we had a common experience to 
bond over. I’d say that working to-
gether was definitely what catalyzed 
the close relationship Josh and I have 
today. Ever since then, he’s felt like 
not only my baby brother, but also my 
friend.

For many people, their relation-

ship with their sibling will be the 
longest one in their life. You bear wit-
ness to every one of their accomplish-
ments and misfortunes. According to 
Kohrman, his siblings know practi-
cally everything about him.

“It’s a very unique thing for sib-

lings, because they’ve known you 
since whenever they open their eyes … 
from day one to now,” Kohrman said.

Korhman said his relationship with 

his older brother blossomed when 
Alex left for college. Suddenly, there 
was an empty seat at family dinners 
and a vacant room at the end of the hall. 
Kohrman had to put in extra effort to 
maintain him and his brother’s rela-
tionship. He would call Alex up every 
once in a while, just to stay in touch.

With his younger sister Sydney, 

Kohrman had it easier. He says they be-
came much closer when Sydney joined 
their high school’s marching band and 
they had a reason to spend a lot more 
time together. Their relationship was 
imbued with a common interest and a 
common friend group, facilitating its 
evolution into something more signifi-
cant than just extreme dodgeball partners.

“Interacting with her and then my 

friends at the same time together kind of 

transitioned it from sibling to more of a 
friendship,” Kohrman said.

For LSA freshman Jessica Cho, that 

transition occurred much earlier. Cho 
described her older sister Maddie as 
“protective,” a quality which she admits 
she didn’t always appreciate enough.

“I always kind of noticed that we 

were a partnership, like we would stick 
together, but I didn’t see that she wanted 
to help me grow and help me improve 
until like, middle school,” Cho said.

Cho looked up to her older sister. 

Maddie would pick her up from school 
every day, and that became a time for 
the two of them to catch up, debate or 
just chat. It was at this point that their 
mom got remarried, so there were a lot 
of changes happening at home for the 
two of them. Between turbulence in 
their family situation and the general 
tragedy that is middle school, Cho came 
to understand that Maddie was her rock.

“The respect (I felt for her) sort of 

transitioned my intimidation (around) her 
into appreciation,” Cho said. “But at the 
same time, the intimidation is still there.”

Cho moved in with Maddie about a 

month and a half ago. Nowadays she 
and her sister are on opposite schedules. 
Maddie is working as an EMT and Cho 
is in her second semester of college, so 
the two rarely have time to spend togeth-
er. Still, they’ve established a tradition 
of family dinners which serve a similar 
purpose to those middle school car rides 
home.

“From her job, a lot of the stuff (Mad-

die) sees can be very traumatic, and she 
is good at handling that and processing 
that and sticking through it in order to 
help people,” Cho said. “And she does 
the same thing for the people that she 
cares a lot about. And I think that’s one 
of the most notable things about her.”

A commentary on sibling love as it enters into adulthood

M 

y dad shows his love 
through gifting t-shirts.

It doesn’t matter the 

occasion or the time of year or the 
person receiving it — the man does it 
out of pure joy. Because of this obses-
sion, it would seem rather intuitive 
that his go-to holiday presents are t-
shirts galore, from the “Don’t speak 
to me before my coffee” shirt for my 
mother to the “Michigan Grandpa” 
shirts for his father.

My dad’s knack for gifting t-shirts 

kicked off 15 or so years ago, at the 
height of March Madness with his 
best friend Scott. The two met when 
they were 18-year-old students at 
the University of Michigan, living 
as freshmen in Alice Lloyd, and they 
quickly grew close when they rushed 
a fraternity together. The two lived 
together for the rest of their college 
careers and eventually moved to the 
same New York City suburb of Mill-
burn, N.J. They were, and still are, an 
inseparable pair who love to create 
fun in any situation, no matter the 
circumstance. 

Through the years, with a love of 

sports and a passion for adrenaline, 
Scott and my dad had done their fair 
share of casual sports betting. So ev-
ery year when March rolled around, 
they both cashed into a handful of 
leagues with numerous potential 
brackets on their side. After some 
time, that tradition became boring 
and repetitive. They no longer got a 
kick out of just cheering for Michi-
gan or winning a few bucks here and 
there. My dad and Scott needed to 
do what they did best: Make some-
thing out of what had become not so 
much.

Something to note about March 

Madness is that there are always a 
handful of lesser-known teams that 
emerge out of the shadows as forces 
to be reckoned with. They’re the 
upset teams, the Cinderella stories, 
the “Who beat Duke?!” soundbites. 

They’re the schools my dad and 
Scott loved to occasionally place wa-
gers on saying they’d go far, but their 
fun usually ended there. But then 
they found the perfect way to spice 
things up: Become dedicated fans 
of these underdog teams. And what 
better way to become a dedicated fan 
than by purchasing the team’s appar-
el for one another?

This was the early 2000s, and 

the internet wasn’t the mass-mar-
ketplace that it is today. My dad and 
Scott had to physically pay a visit to 
the smaller universities whenever 
they had the chance just to secure a 
t-shirt. For example, when my dad 
took a business trip to Nashville, 
Tenn., he made a point to stop by 
Belmont to get Scott a Bruins short 
sleeve. He did the same with Florida 
Gulf Coast when he went on vaca-
tion in Naples, Fla. 

And with that, a tradition was 

born. A small tradition that, with the 
help of the internet, became larger, 
more accessible and undoubtedly 
significant with the years to come. 
Since the pair began this ritual, they 
extended the limitations to shirts 
with famous movie quotes on them, 
and individually have collected and 
gifted over 50 t-shirts for the other 
(all of which they wear). 

The action of gifting Scott the 

perfect short sleeve tee gave my dad 
so much satisfaction that it began 
to carry over to other significant re-
lationships in his life. After every 
business trip, concert or outing, my 
dad returned home with a shirt for 
each member of my family, allowing 
us all to start collections of our own. 
Because of him, I now have a pile 
full of obscure Grateful Dead tees, a 
Longhorns sleep shirt and a Breck-
enridge v-neck, among others. I also 
now have an extremely sentimental 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg dancing bear 
shirt — a gift that was sent to comfort 
me and commemorate her after she 

passed. Most recently, a shirt with 
cartoon drawings of my beloved dogs 
was added to my collection, which I 
received following an anxiety attack 
that occurred on the phone with 
him. With each package came yet 
another reminder that he loved me, 
was thinking of me and was here for 
me whenever, through whatever. 

I’ve only bought a t-shirt as a gift 

for someone a few times in my life, 
with my dad being the primary re-
ceiver. But even so, gift-giving has 
never exactly been my strong suit. 
I never know what to get, where to 
get it or what I’m even looking for. 
I’m much better at showing my love 
through articulating my emotions 
rather than offering a tangible sym-
bol of it. Birthday cards and love let-
ters take me only minutes to write, 
and when I feel something strong 
enough, I feel compelled to verbalize 
it in whatever capacity I see fit. I of-
ten don’t take vulnerability into con-
sideration — I see words as my ar-
mor and verbal support as my form 
of expression. 

I show my love by explicitly tell-

ing people I need them, I care about 
them, I’d give anything in the world 
just to spend time with them. This is a 
drastically different experience than 
gifting t-shirts. But then again, peo-
ple often have radically different and 
niche ways of expressing their love. 
This phenomenon is so persistent in 
society that in 1992, the author Gary 
Chapman created a theory explain-
ing these differences in a book titled 
“The Five Love Languages”. Chap-
man theorizes that each member in 
a relationship — romantic, platonic 
or familial — offer love in the way 
they want to receive it, with actions 
falling into one of five so-called “lan-
guages”: physical touch, quality time, 
acts of service, words of affirmation 
and receiving gifts. 

The book ended up gaining more 

attention than anticipated, with 

over 13 million copies sold world-
wide and a spot on The New York 
Times’ best seller list since 2007. 
Chapman’s theory of love languages 
has received a significant amount 
of praise from major media orga-
nizations and the general public, 
becoming a common phrase in ev-
eryday conversation. The amount 
of positive feedback and success 
stories from reading the book 
makes it evident that Chapman’s 
theory has at least some truth to 
it. And though I admit I have nev-
er read the book myself, I see his 
general ideas play out in my every-
day life.

However, I didn’t consciously buy 

into the idea of love languages for a 
while — and that was a problem. 

Because I have always been so 

vocal with my feelings, I saw others 
staying silent about theirs as a sign 
of dislike or mistrust. I desperately 
wanted my friends, family or signifi-
cant others to not only tell me how 
they felt, but to shout it from the 
rooftops. I needed to hear a confir-
mation that our relationship was real 
because in my eyes without that ar-
ticulation, it wasn’t. 

As I write this now, I am further 

reminded of how backwards and 
toxic that train of thought can be. I 
failed to recognize that some peo-
ple have a harder time speaking in 
a vulnerable capacity than others, 
and that some people avoid it all to-
gether. But this absence of explicit 
language doesn’t necessarily equate 
to an absence of love — it just indi-
cates that they have a different way 
of expressing it, a different love lan-
guage. My perspective on relation-
ships, kindness and care changed 
significantly once I took a step back 
and recognized that.

Jajikaya- o beloved cat, you make these 
trying times much more bearable 
with your passive, yet loving presence. 
You’re the best neighbor cat a college 
house could ever want.

D- I have such a huge crush on you. 
You live everyday with purpose and 
passion, despite it all- I may never 
actually get to tell you, but I’m always 
in your corner regardless.

Hails—I hate it that you’re not around. 
And the fact that you didn’t call. But 
mostly I hate the way I don’t hate you, 
not even close, not even a little bit, not 
even at all.

To every member of the MMB- it’s been 
a lonely year for us, and I just want you 
all to know I love and miss you dearly. 
I can’t wait for us to be together as a 
family again.

S, Anytime you need to talk about love 
issues I’ll be there. Love can suck some-
times but I truly believe you’ll come out 
the other side stronger for having those 
feelings. -M

E, I enjoy your company even if it’s just 
seeing your face while doing work over 
a video call. You’re an amazing book 
club buddy and I appreciate you. -M

Luke—you fill my world with affection, 
baked goods, and opportunities to 
make myself the best person I can
