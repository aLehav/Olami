Candidates in both 

parties release 
comprehensive 

plans on debt, tuition

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Among other unique qualities, 

this presidential election stands 
out in that it’s putting the spotlight 
on and taking new approaches to 
many previously under-the-radar 
topics — such as campus issues like 
college student debt and campus 
sexual assault.

Seeking to appeal to young 

voters, 
all 
major 
GOP 
and 

Democratic 
candidates 
have 

presented plans to address student 
loan debt and restructure higher 
education to benefit more young 
Americans. From tuition-free state 
universities to heavily subsidized 
tuition to restructuring of student 
loans, candidates on both sides 
have highlighted reform efforts.

The Democrats were the first 

to take on the policy focus, when 
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) 
entered the race with higher 
education reform as a key pillar 
to his platform. His challenger, 
Hillary Clinton, also proposed 
her own solution, and leading 
Republicans soon followed suit.

Now down to the last four in a 

race that once had 17 — with U.S. 
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tx.), Sen. Marco 
Rubio 
(R-Fla.), 
businessman 

Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. 
John Kasich — higher education 
has 
been 
a 
less 
prominent 

focus for the Republicans than 
the Democrats overall, but an 
emphasis nonetheless.

Cynthia 
Wilbanks, 
vice 

president for government relations 
at the University of Michigan, 
in response to the call by all 
candidates for universities to take 
more responsibility for managing 
tuition costs, said the University 
is working more closely with 
students.

“The most important thing is 

that we have receptive students 
and families,” Wilbanks said. “One

Information senior Sonia Doshi introduces a workshop at the Mental Health Monologues during the Depression on College Campuses Conference at Rackham Graduate School on Thursday. 

Event part of two-

day conference 
on depression on 
college campuses

By MADELINE MCGERSON

Daily Staff Reporter

Thursday 
afternoon, 
about 

60 students, faculty and social 
workers from across the country 
gathered to attend a Mental 
Health Monologues workshop 
led by Information senior Sonia 
Doshi, founder of Healthy Minds 

Student Leadership Coalition.

The 
workshop 
was 
part 

of the second day of the 14th 
annual Depression on College 
Campuses Conferences, hosted 
by the University of Michigan’s 
Depression Center.

Doshi created the event last year 

with the aim of giving students the 
opportunity to share their stories 
and experiences with mental 
health and reduce the stigma 
of mental health on campus. 
Three 
students 
performed 

monologues during a series of 
workshops, throughout which 
Doshi explained the process and 
intentions of the actual Mental 

Health Monologues, which will 
take place in April.

Speakers at the Monologues are 

anonymous due to the sensitive 
and personal nature of their 
stories. One student shared her 
story of living with obsessive-
compulsive disorder.

“When you have OCD, it is not 

uncommon for your thoughts to 
give you superpowers,” she said. 
“Once you get rid of one fear, 
another comes back.”

Following the first story, Doshi 

asked the audience to create a 
mental map, which encouraged 
participants to explore a theme 
such as pain, and then form a 

script for a potential monologue of 
their own.

“This activity simplifies the act 

of taking your entire life story and 
condensing it into a five minute 
performance,” Doshi said.

Nyshourn 
Price, 
student 

services specialist at the School 
of Social Work, shared her 
experiences as a single mother 
during the exercise.

“I saw that I was able to pull 

up something so quickly that is 
so old for me,” Price said. “There 
were two issues that came up for 
me. Grief, as I lost my mother two 
years ago, and my past relationship

Kalamazoo mass 
shooting renews 
calls for increased 

regulations

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

Though 
Uber 
and 
other 

ridesharing services are facing 
a nationwide call for increased 
regulation on drivers — in Michigan 
specifically, 
following 
a 
mass 

shooting carried out by an Uber 
driver in Kalamazoo who killed six 
— University of Michigan students 
continue to use on Uber as a reliable 
way to get around campus.

LSA junior Nadine Jawad said 

she takes safety precautions when 
using Uber, such as carrying 
pepper spray and a charged phone, 
but remains loyal to the service 
even after the mass shootings.

“My parents strongly discourage 

my use of Uber so often due to the 
recent shooting in Kalamazoo, 
so I can’t help but hold a tinge of 
fear subconsciously,” she said. 
“However, of the 50 times I’ve 
used an Uber I’ve never had an 
issue, (but) you never know what to 
expect. Personally I’m not scared 
so long as it’s light outside and I 
have a phone and my pepper spray.”

In response to the Kalamazoo 

incidents, as well as others that 
have occured in the state and 
beyond, critics of Uber and Lyft 
have pointed to issues of safety 
originating 
with 
companies’ 

verification process. Uber and Lyft 
drivers go through a significantly 
shorter interview process than rival 
taxi companies and do not have to 

submit government background 
checks or pay fees to obtain city 
licenses, 
Newsweekreported. 

Drivers found to be violent are 
immediately suspended, according 
to Uber’s policy, but if a customer 
lodges 
a 
complaint 
against 

something subjective, like bad 
driving, the driver may not be 
immediately 
punished. 
Jeremy 

Dalton, the shooter responsible 
for six deaths in Kalamazoo, had a 
“good” rating of 4.73 and favorable 
feedback from riders, Time found. 

In an interview, Fermaish Ali, 

an Uber driver in Detroit, admitted 
the company’s hiring practices 
could use tweaking.

“Being scared is justified,” he 

said. “You are given a service in 
which even the employer does not 
know the driver. Even when they 
have done background research 
on the drivers, there is no real 
meetings or interview after being 
hired. Everything from there on is 
online or on the phone.”

LSA freshman Stephanie Harris 

agreed with Jawad, saying she 
feels Uber is more dependable than 
other options for getting home at 
night, such as walking or taking the 
bus.

“I’ve always thought the concept 

of Uber is sketchy, but walking 
home from parties late at night 
is sketchier,” she said. “Living on 
North Campus doesn’t really give 
me much of a choice since the buses 
are so unreliable.”

University Police spokeswoman 

Diane Brown said she woudn’t 
dissuade 
students 
from 
using 

ride-sharing services, but warned 
them to only request rides through 
Uber and Lyft’s official apps and to 
exercise caution.

Council members 
say transparency a 
recurring issue in 

department

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Members of the Ann Arbor 

Human 
Rights 
Commission 

addressed 
City 
Council 

Thursday as the body voted 
to accept the commission’s 
recommendations 
regarding 

police-community relations.

Prompted 
by 
the 
police 

shooting of Ann Arbor resident 
Aura Rosser, a Black woman, 
in 2014, the HRC extensively 
studied 
police 
oversight 

practices across the country and 
published a report in November 
2015. 
Washtenaw 
County 

prosecutor’s office ultimately 
declined 
to 
press 
charges 

against the officer involved in 
the shooting in January 2015.

The 
commission’s 
report 

calls for the appointment of an 
independent police auditor, the 
creation of a civilian board to 
investigate complaints against 
police and improved channels 
for dispute resolution and crisis 
intervention.

Several 
members 
of 
the 

locally appointed commission 
— including two University 
of Michigan law students — 
were present at the meeting to 
speak in favor of adopting the 
recommendations put forth by 
their report.

Commission 
chair 
Leslie 

Stambaugh, 
an 
Ann 
Arbor 

resident, told councilmembers 
the independent police auditor 
should urgently be funded by the 
city’s May budget deadline.

“We want council to provide 

funding for this before the 
budget deadline in May so that 
it can get installed quickly and 
effectively,” Stambaugh said. 
“Otherwise, we fear it will get 
delayed even further and be 
implemented poorly, and that 
would be a waste.”

Ann Arbor resident Robert 

McGee, who was in attendance, 
also 
praised 
the 
report’s 

recommendations and the drive 
for greater police transparency, 
but 
cautioned 
that 
civilian 

oversight should not directly 
obstruct the operations of the 
Ann Arbor Police Department.

“Nowadays 
with 
the 

mounting societal pressure on 
our men and women in blue, 
I fully support any effort to 
improve 
relations 
between 

them and the public, and in the 
same breadth I also support a 
mechanism for the public to be 
heard,” McGee said. “However, 
I do caution the citizen oversight 
board should not interfere with 
ongoing criminal investigations, 
departmental 
disciplinary 

actions, union issues and any 
real-time events.”

As the council moved to 

unanimously 
approve 
the 

resolution 
to 
accept 
the 

report, 
the 
councilmembers 

acknowledged 
the 
work 
of 

the commission — who are 
unpaid volunteers — and the 

State legislators 
hope to open up

In a bid to increase access, 

two 
bills 
were 
introduced 

in 
the 
Michigan 
House 
of 

Representatives 
last 
week 
to 

provide tampons and sanitary 
napkins for free in women’s 
restrooms 
in 
public 
school 

buildings 
and 
state-owned 

facilities. 

House Bills 5427 and 5426, 

introduced by Rep. Sarah Roberts 
(D–St. 
Clair 
Shores), 
follow 

another bill focused on access, 
HB 5234, introduced in January 
2016 
that 
aimed 
to 
remove 

sales taxes from all feminine 
hygiene products. The bills join a 
nationwide push to make feminine 
hygiene products more accessible 
to women, which started in 
January when California State 
Rep. Cristina Garcia (D–Calif.) 
introduced the first piece of state 
legislation to abolish the “tampon 
tax.” As of now, only five states have 
gotten rid of the tax: Minnesota, 
Pennsylvania, 
Maryland, 
New 

Jersey and Massachusetts.

Roberts said she was first 

inspired to work toward making 
feminine hygiene products more 
readily available after hearing 
about the work of an advocate 
in New York. The three bills 
concerning 
tampon 
access 

currently in the House, she said, 
are part of a package to open up

Keynote speaker 
discusses app that 

uses behavorial 

therapy technique

By GRACE CANFIELD

For the Daily

The University of Michigan 

Depression Center closed out its 
two-day Depression on College 
Campuses Conference with a 
keynote address from Dr. Robert 
Morris 
titled 
“Crowdsourcing 

Mental 
Health.” 
Thursday. 

Attendees 
were 
primarily 

University professors and alumni, 
as well as parents of children with 
depression.

Dr. John Greden, executive 

director 
of 
the 
University’s 

Comprehensive 
Depression 

Center, started the conference 14 
years ago in response to increasing 
calls for action to address the 
stigma surrounding depression and 

anxiety on college campuses. He 
sought to involve other professors 
both at the University and at other 
colleges across the United States, 
eventually bringing on Todd Sevig 
and Daniel Eisenberg, co-founders 
of the University’s Depression 
Center, to help organize the event, 
ultimately expanding to include 
450 registered in attendance this 
year. Sevig is currently the director 
of the University’s Counseling and 
Psychological Services.

Greden said though he has been 

involved in the conference each 
year, the organizational efforts of 
other University members have 
allowed the program to expand 
and improve.

“The credit for organizing a 

lot of this just belongs to a team 
of students, counselors, RAs, a 
number of administrators — I 
mean everybody gets together and 
says, ‘who should we invite this 
year that’s really special?’” he said.

Morris, 
the 
committee’s 

choice, is the founder of the social 
platform Koko, an iPhone-based 

app that strives to connect users 
looking for alternative methods to 
cope with depression and anxiety.

Morris explained that he came 

up with the idea for Koko while 
struggling with depression on his 
own as a student at Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 
Technology. 
He 

encountered a website called Stack 
Overflow, which allows users to 
post questions while learning how 
to program and write code, and 
other users will help them solve 
their problem.

“Just as we can use this system 

to identify and fix bugs in our code, 
perhaps we can do something 
similar to help us identify and fix 
bugs in our thinking,” Morris said.

The app uses an interface 

similar to that of Twitter or 
Facebook, allowing users to post 
about day-to-day situations and 
ask for advice, which is given 
in the form of “reframes” by 
anonymous users. The “reframes” 
are a system of commenting and 
refining discussion to approach an 
issue from a different perspective. 
This follows a method of cognitive 
behavioral 
therapy 
in 
which 

seemingly overwhelming issues 
are recast in a different, hopefully 
more positive light, with the intent 
to help the user find a new way 
to think about the problem or 
situation.

Morris used a personal anecdote 

to illustrate the experience of 
using the app, in which he posted 
about a stressful situation that he 
encountered in his life.

“My wife really wants a baby, 

but I’m not sure,” he wrote. “There 
is a chance my child will struggle 
with depression and chronic pain, 
as I have.”

He followed this post with what 

he described as a negative thought, 
an explanation of the view that 
pervaded his way of thinking 
about the situation:

“I worry I won’t be able to care 

for (the child), as I sometimes 
struggle to care for myself,” the 
post read.

Morris 
then 
showed 
the 

audience multiple examples of 
“reframes” that he got from other 
users, similar to comments on

Performance topics 
range from family, 

to health and 

identity

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan 

Slam Poetry Club hosted its 
final campus performance of the 
academic year Thursday in the 
Michigan League basement to an 
audience of 40 people. The themes 
of the poems performed centered 
around family, acceptance and 
identity.

Performers 
at 
the 
event 

were LSA sophomores Laura 
Schwendeman and Alyssa Holt 
and LSA juniors Trevor Torres 
and Eileen Li. The four compose 
the organization’s National Slam 
Poetry Team. From April 6 to 9, 
they will travel to Austin, Texas 
to compete in the College Unions 
Poetry Slam Invitational against 
more than 60 different collegiate 
teams.

Schwendeman 
shared 
a 

poem during the event about 
her grandmother’s battle with 
postpartum 
psychosis, 
and 

another about her relationship 
with her father.

“A lot of the poems we read 

tonight aren’t specific instances 
or experiences that everyone in 
the audience might have had, but 
hopefully they could connect on 
them on some level,” she said. 
“That’s sort of the basis of poetry 
… to get people to relate to us in a 
way we can relate to them.”

LSA junior Coral Lu said she 

attended the event to support 
Schwendeman and the club as a 
whole. One of the most moving 
poems for her, she said, was 
Torres’ poem about his battle 
with juvenile diabetes and celiac 
disease.

“They were all really powerful 

and all really sad,” Lu said. “It 
was just really powerful how his 
personal experiences talked to 
you … I didn’t really expect it to be 
that personal and strong.”

For 
Schwendeman, 
the 

evening’s performance was a 
chance for the team not only to 
showcase its work, but also to 
gain feedback from the University 
audience 
about 
its 
poems. 

Forming the national team is a 
long process, she said, beginning 
in January. In the lead up to the 
final decisions, there are both a 
series of fall events and poetry 

slams each month.

Lu said she thought it was 

important for students to come 
and support organizations like the 
Slam Poetry Club, both to provide 
feedback to the poets about their 
writing as well as to be exposed to 
a new art form.

“I think there are a lot of 

amazing things going on on 
campus that people don’t really 
know of,” she said. “They’re going 
to nationals and it’s a pretty big 
thing, but not too many people 
know of it. And they definitely 
need to practice, and we need to 
get to know how awesome they 
are and what slam poetry really 
is.”

Kylie 
Carpenter, 
a 
Public 

Health masters student, said 
she 
found 
Li’s 
poem 
about 

miscommunication between her 
mother’s native language and her 
English the most powerful, adding 
that she thought slam poetry gives 
students an outlet they wouldn’t 
otherwise find at the University.

“I thought that was interesting, 

like the different perspective 
of the culture,” she said. “It’s 
something like a hobby that 
people have, you can’t express 
it during classes. It’s something 
you can kind of experience in a

of the ways we have been called to 
be more helpful is spending more 
time with what it is students are 
expected to do in terms of financial 
aid.”

Democrats
Among the two Democrats left 

standing, Clinton and Sanders, 
both agree there should be changes 
made to the higher education 
system and tuition rates should 
be severely cut, but their plans 
to do so have several significant 
differences.

Nonetheless, 
Public 
Policy 

senior Max Lerner, chair of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said he believes both 
candidates’ plans encompass core 
values

“I think that Democrats, for 

a while now, have shown that 
they are the party that cares for 
students,” Lerner said. “They 
are always fighting for bigger 
funding, and fighting for lower 
tuition and making sure that states 
have enough money to fund their 
universities.”

College Republicans did not 

respond to repeated requests for 
comment.

For Sanders, the main policy 

push is ensuring all students can 
attend college for free. As a senator, 
Sanders introduced the College 
for All Act, which would allocate 
$47 billion per year to eliminate 
undergraduate tuition and fees at 
public colleges and universities. 
His current plan would also cut 
student loan interest rates down to 
2.37 percent.

Sanders has said if elected 

president, he would also expand 
need-based financial aid and work-
study programs to move toward 
making college debt-free.

LSA 
sophomore 
Nicholas 

Kolenda, president of Students for 
Sanders, said he believes Sanders’ 
plan is unique based on its inclusive 
nature.

“It’s a slippery slope when you 

exclude people from public goods 
because they can’t pay for it,” 
Kolenda said. “We don’t exclude 
the top 1 percent from public 
growth because they can privately 
pay for college.”

This 
extensive 
plan 
would 

require funding of $74 billion each 
year. To achieve this, Sanders plans 
to tax a fraction of a percent on 
Wall Street speculation.

In contrast, while not planning 

to make college entirely free, 
Clinton’s New College Compact 
plan aims to reign in rising college 
debt and work with universities 
to hold them responsible for 
their tuition levels. She has also 
said she plans to expand work-
study programs. According to her 
website, Clinton’s College Compact 
will require families to make an 
“affordable and realistic family 
contribution” to the cost of college.

LSA junior Anushka Sarkar, 

outreach 
director 
and 
event 

coordinator 
for 
Students 
for 

Hillary, said she thinks Clinton’s 
plan is a much more feasible one in 
comparison to Sanders’.

“I am confident that she will be 

able to (cut tuition), and there is a 
difference between an idealistic 
policy and a pragmatic policy 
position,” Sarkar said. “Hillary 
can make it more affordable and 
refinance student loans — that’s 
realistic, that’s something you can 
hold the president accountable for. 
Free college is not.”

As well, under the Compact, 

the federal government would 
give grants to states that commit 
and cut interest rates on loans — 
as well as states investing in their 

own public institutions. Overall, 
Clinton’s plan is slated to cost about 
$350 billion over the course of 10 
years, which she has said she would 
raise by closing tax loopholes 
and expenditures for wealthy 
individuals.

Republicans
On the Republican side, the 

policy issue has received less 
of an emphasis, and the depth 
of candidates’ plans to combat 
student debt range. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Casey 

VanderWeide, member of Students 
for 
Rubio, 
said 
he 
believes 

Republicans like Rubio have a 
better 
student 
debt 
platform 

because of how their plans would 
be funded.

“Rubio’s plan is superior to the 

Democrats’ plan because it does 
not rely on other people’s money,” 
VanderWeide said. “Sanders’ Wall 
Street speculation plan does not 
guarantee a set amount of revenue. 
Investors will try to avoid this tax 
by trading overseas. Not only big 
investors will be affected by this 
new tax but also small investors.”

Rubio has laid out several 

efforts to modernize the current 
financial aid system that attempt 
to aid with student borrowing in 
his approach to student debt — one 
of the most comprehensive among 
the GOP — saying he will overhaul 
and modernize it. In particular, he 
plans to consolidate the multiple 
tax benefits written into the 
Internal Revenue Service code 
for students into one provision 
for 
post-secondary 
education, 

to help with applying to federal 
financial aid. He also plans to 
make all financial aid information 
available in one location to reduce 
the burden and time families spend 
searching for this information.

Last year, President Barack 

Obama’s 
administration 
made 

significant changes to FAFSA, the 
free application for federal student 
aid, in an attempt to make it easier 
to use, including opening up the 
application earlier and using a 
family’s income information.

VanderWeide said he thought 

Rubio’s particular attention to 
student debt and higher education 
stemmed from his background.

“I think Rubio, out of all the 

Republican 
candidates, 
has 

the most thought-out student 
debt 
platform 
because, 
when 

he graduated law school, he 
had $100,000 in student loans,” 
VanderWeide said. “Marco Rubio 
did not come from a family of 
money... He understands what 
students are going through because 
he has gone through the process.”

Rubio has also discussed several 

other main policy ideas to tackle 
student debt, including establishing 
income-based 
repayment 
for 

federal student loans — a partial 
system for which already exists 
under the Revised Pay As You Earn 
Plan, which debuted in December 
2015. As well, the senator’s plan 
includes a provision to allow 
students to apply for the “Student 
Investment Plans” from approved 
investors to help young Americans 
finance their education.

Kasich has also laid out several 

proposals to aid with higher 
education, largely based on his time 
as governor of Ohio where student 
debt is above the national average 
according 
to 
Forbes. 
During 

his time as governor, the state’s 
universities have stabilized tuition 
costs at their public universities, 
and 
increased 
funding 
to 

universities with high graduation 
rates under his creation of Ohio’s 
Task Force on Affordability and 
Efficiency. Whereas many states 
allocate funds to higher education 
institutions based off of the number 
of students who attend, schools 

in Ohio receive rewards for the 
number of students who graduate.

The 
Task 
Force 
presented 

recommendations 
such 
as 

incentivising students to take at 
least 15 credits a semester and 
encourage universities to build 
up their summer programs. In 
addition to encouraging students 
to stay on track to graduate in four 
years, Ohio has worked to keep 
tuition rates low and has gone as far 
as addressing the cost of textbooks.

During his campaign, Kasich 

has said he would like to encourage 
programs like that in place in Ohio 
to expand nationally — particularly 
his program which allocates funds 
based on graduation rather than 
enrollment. He has also said he 
intends to increase opportunities 
for students to receive college 
credits while still in high school to 
help reduce the cost of the student’s 
future tuition.

Among the other two candidates 

left in the GOP race — Cruz and 
Trump — neither have introduced 
significant policy plans, though 
both have mentioned the issue.

When he ran for the Senate in 

2012, Cruz stated that student loan 
debt should be a state issue rather 
than a federal government issue. 
During this same campaign cycle, 
he called for the abolishment of 
the U.S. Department of Education, 
reiterating that student debt policy 
decisions should be in the hands of 
state and local governments.

During 
his 
presidential 

campaign, he hasn’t expressed 
much beyond that on the topic, 
though he has noted that similar to 
Rubio, he graduated with $100,000 
in debt.

“I just paid off my student loans 

five or six years ago. Economic 
growth is critical to young people 
because if we want this generation 
to be able to pay off their loans 
and develop the skills to live the 
American dream, we’ve got to 
return to an environment where 
small businesses are growing 
and flourishing, and creating jobs 
and opportunities,” Cruz told 
theSkimm earlier this year.

Similar to Cruz, Trump has 

yet to lay out a concrete plan for 
higher education and student 
debt. However, he has claimed 
several times that the government 
unfairlyprofits from the billions of 
student loans.

When 
announcing 
his 

candidacy, Trump said, “People 
are tired... of spending more money 
on education than any nation in the 
world per capita.”

Other than that statement, 

Trump hasn’t said much else 
regarding his plans for debt should 
he be elected into office, though 
like Cruz he has suggested cutting 
the Department of Education.

The Republican frontrunner, 

has, however, drawn controversy 
over his own involvement in the 
higher education industry — his for-
profit college, Trump University, 
now the Trump Entrepreneur 
Initiative, is currently facing a legal 
suit for possible illegal business 
practices.

As many as a 25 percent of the 

students have requested a refund 
for their tuition costs to the 
University, according to CNN.

Regardless of who they’re voting 

for, students see higher education 
being discussed in the campaign as 
positive and with the potential for 
long lasting change.

“I think we’re at a crossroads,” 

LSA sophomore Eleonore Edgell 
said. 
“This 
election 
is 
very 

important because I think we 
have the potential to create policy 
within these four years that can 
create lasting impacts for the next 
twenty or fifty or a hundred years. 
Voting is really important.”

with my ex-husband.”

Another 
student 
monologue 

addressed depression by utilizing 
the metaphor of a Chinese finger 
trap toy. The student explained that 
the goal of a Chinese finger trap is 
to escape as quickly as possible.

“I am in a Chinese finger trap,” 

he said. “From age 12, I was not in 
control. I could not control my older 
sister’s anger, her hating school and 
hating life. Her punching holes in 
the wall the size of my head. I could 
not control my sister’s depression.”

The speakers of the three 

monologues underwent a lengthy 
process of practices and workshops 
in order to prepare for the event, 
which Doshi further highlighted 
by asking attendees to create 
poems from their mental maps.

The third monologue was from 

a speaker who compared her 

obsessive-compulsive disorder to 
sneezing.

“Sneezing is a universal truth,” 

she said. “Everyone turns and says, 
‘Bless you.’ Sneezing interrupts our 
daily lives. But despite this need, 
a sneeze is usually technically 
voluntary.”

If you can understand the nature 

of a sneeze, she continued, you can 
gain better understanding of the 
compulsions associated with OCD 
and Tourette syndrome.

“They are constant interruptions 

in your life with tensions and urges 
that simply must be satisfied,” 
she said. “For the last year, my 
Tourette’s has had a physical take 
on flexing my right jaw muscle. 
Just like a sneeze, I have to do it. 
We have to move from sympathy to 
empathy. There is no ‘bless you.’ ”

Price said that events such as 

the Mental Health Monologues are 
vital in continuing the dialogue of 
mental health on college campuses.

“I do a lot of work with 

“People 
need 
to 
take 

responsibility for their safety,” 
Brown said. “Just like we suggest 
with walking, going with another 
person or friend is advisable.”

Both Uber and Lyft have been 

called into question in Ann Arbor 
before. City Councilconsidered 
a measure in 2014 requiring 
Uber drivers to comply with 
the 
Michigan 
Limousine 

Transportation Act and purchase 
commercial vehicle licenses. The 

proposal did not garner enough 
votes to pass a first reading, as 
the five councilmembers voting 
against the bill cited unreasonable 
cost burdens on drivers.

Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman (D–Ward 3), who did 
not have a seat on City Council in 
2014, but noted that city leaders 
still cannot pass effective, wide-
reaching legislation. 

“Should there be increased 

regulation to ensure safety of 
the rider? Of course,” he said. 
“Locally, 
we 
need 
direction 

from the state. Until then these 

services will operate in a gray area, 
which doesn’t work to anyone’s 
advantage.”

Ackerman 
also 
critiqued 

heavy scrutiny of ridesharing, 
citing it as an important mode of 
transportation for present and 
future students.

“I reject the premise that Uber 

or ridesharing can be blamed 
for this atrocity,” he said. “Jason 
Dalton was also an insurance 
broker. Should people be worried 
when they go in to buy insurance? 
No. This is a gun access issue. This 
is a mental health issue.”

conversation on women’s health 
and menstruation.

“We 
need 
to 
have 
more 

conversations about this topic 
because menstruation is a taboo 
subject and a girl has to feel 
embarrassed to ask for a feminine 
hygiene 
product,” 
Roberts 

said. “They should never feel 
embarrassed about a completely 
natural thing that happens in a 
woman’s body. I want to take the 
shame away from this issue.”

The recent push in legislation 

parallels a change in advertising 
for tampons, such as ads from 
U by Kotex poking fun at older 
commercials that avoided any talk 
of blood or the actual function 
of the products the commercials 
were trying to sell. Joanne Bailey, 
director of the Nurse Midwifery 
Service and professor of women’s 
health in the Women’s Studies 
Department at the University, said 
she sees the changes in legislation 
and advertising as a break in 
the taboo previously placed on 
menstruation.

“If we look at social media or 

advertisement, there’s been a real 
change in the messaging around 

feminine hygiene products. Even 
the name is kind of bizarre; it 
whitewashes it and doesn’t talk 
about what is going on,” Bailey 
said. “If we look at the changing 
language and openness around 
it, this indicates that, as a society, 
we are changing our perspectives 
as our ability to talk about it 
changes.”

LSA sophomore Ashley Wilson, 

social media director for Students 
for Choice, said she believes this 
legislation is key to opening up 
dialogue about the necessity of 
feminine hygiene products.

“Periods are not this secret, 

shameful thing. If these products 
became openly available at your 
local secretary of state, in public 
schools and courthouses, it would 
be much harder for our society to 
pretend like they do not happen,” 
Wilson said. “The sooner we 
put an end to all of the stigma, 
the sooner we have a healthier 
society that is more comfortable 
discussing reproductive health 
care without fear of alienation.”

Robert said she sees herself as 

a voice for young girls who worry 
about getting their period while 
in school, potentially taking away 
from their ability to focus while in 
class.

“I felt really passionate that 

these were free and available 
because oftentimes a girl’s period 
can start and she doesn’t know it, 
and you need exact change and 
the dispenser may not need work,” 
Roberts said. “Or they have to ask 
a friend or ask a teacher — and why 
should we make young women go 
through that?”

Bailey said she thought an 

increase of women in both the 
legislature 
and 
advertising 

companies, such as Roberts, is 
a testament to gender equality 
as more women are able to take 
leadership positions and break 
taboos on issues like menstruation.

“Fifty percent of the population 

are women, so it’s a huge marketing 
opportunity. It is a taboo that is 
breaking because more women 
are able to participate in the 
advertising and decision-making 
that is changing it,” Bailey said. 
“It feels completely invisible to 
men and it’s uncomfortable and a 
taboo topic, so it’s easy to keep it 
invisible, so it certainly is female 
lawmakers. You can’t imagine 
a man doing this. More women 
in power are challenging those 
questions.”

immediate comment.

Other anonymous users of the 
app provided him with ways of 
rethinking the situation based 
on how they had perceived it 
objectively, allowing him to see 
positives about himself and the 
situation that he possibly hadn’t 
seen before.

In a Q and A after the speech, 

University alum Dr. Neal Elkin 
asked about the demographics that 

the app is actually able to reach, 
and the challenge of getting data 
from a website where anonymity 
is so integral.

“Have you tracked topics that 

people are discussing — whether 
it’s bipolar disorder, depression, 
suicidality?” he asked.

In response, Morris noted that 

queries are organized by the topics 
to which they pertain, such as 
marriage, parenthood, or college, 
not specific mental disorders, 
also stressing that the app is not a 
substitute for getting professional 
help.

Greden said he thought forums 

such as the Morris’s keynote and 
the conference are another way 
to change the way students and 
faculty alike think about mental 
health issues like anxiety and 
depression.

“I’m really pleased to say, I think 

with accuracy, that the University 
of Michigan has been a leader in 
changing that trend,” Greden said. 
“This is the largest conference 
of its kind … it has gone on for 14 
years. The first year we started it, 
we only planned it for one year, 
and people wouldn’t let us quit.”

Schwendeman said she saw 

slam poetry as an authentic 
way for students to express 
themselves.

“I feel once we got to college, 

we 
wanted 
something 
more 

authentic and real and raw, and 
this is a really easy way to tell 
your story 100 percent honestly,” 
she said. “When I first went to a 
poetry slam, I was floored, like ‘I 
have to do that!’ because you just 
write your story down, and then 
you just get up in front of a mic and 
say it and that’s really powerful.”

professionalism of the AAPD.

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) said 
the 
commission 
fulfilled 
its 

civic duty and stressed that 
the independent police auditor 
should be immediately funded 
for the next fiscal year due to 
gaps in transparency during the 
commission’s review.

“This was a labor of love. It’s 

not that (the commission) didn’t 

think we don’t have the greatest 
police force, it’s because they 
believe in democracy,” Kalispathy 
said, noting the members of the 
commission 
committed 
hours 

of their time without a budget to 
write the report.

Kalispathy added that AAPD 

did not grant the commission full 
transparency during the drafting 
of the report, mentioning in 
particular their refusal to grant 
access 
to 
their 
“use-of-force 

forms,” a report commonly filled 
out by a member of the police 
department after an officer is 

accused of excessive force.

Councilmember Jack Eaton (D–

Ward 4) commended AAPD, and 
said increased civilian oversight 
is not necessarily a criticism of the 
department.

“I don’t think there’s anyone 

who’s a bigger fan of our police 
department than I am, so I want 
to emphasize that asking for an 
oversight body isn’t criticism of 
our police department or their 
staff,” Eaton said. “The police 
department 
shouldn’t 
police

C

entral Student Government elec-
tion season is upon us. Over the next 
few weeks, you will be accosted by 

candidates as you walk through the Diag 
and you will receive scores of social media 
reminders to vote. Come election day, if 
you vote, chances are you will either vote 
for the party your friend is in, for the party 
that annoys you the least or write in some 
campus celebrity. If you go with the latter 
option, more likely than not you will want 
to write in Jim Harbaugh. Many of your 
classmates will do the same, and Coach 
Harbaugh will take third or fourth place, 
depending on how many viable parties run. 
Conventional wisdom says these votes will 
be thrown away. But that might not be true.

The Central Student Government Con-

stitution (yes, there is such a thing) states, 
“No representative may run for election 
or hold office representing a constituen-
cy of which that person is not a member.” 
This means that a representative must be 
“enrolled or actively working toward their 
degree.” Nowhere else does the Constitu-
tion mention qualifications for office. That 
settles the question, right? Jim Harbaugh 
isn’t working towards a degree, therefore he 
cannot be president. Not quite.

The CSG Constitution uses very specific 

language. It uses the term “representative” 
only when it refers to members of the legis-
lative branch — the Assembly. When it refers 
to the president, it uses the term “president.” 

When it refers to members of Central Student 
Government as a whole, it uses the terms 
“members” and “officers.” 

There is a legal canon of statutory con-

struction called “expressio unius est exclu-
sio alterius,” which means the expression of 
one thing comes at the exclusion of others. If 
you state one item, and not another, you only 
meant to include that one item. 

Note that the one clause in the Constitu-

tion containing an enrollment restriction 
only mentions representatives. It does not 
say “members” or “officers.” Thus, using the 
expressio unis canon, the text of the Consti-
tution states that anyone — student or not — 
can be president, but only those enrolled as 
students working toward their degrees can 
be representatives. If the Constitution want-
ed that restriction to apply to all members 
of CSG or the president, it would have used 
“members” or “officers,” as it does in other 
sections. Likewise, if it wanted to include 
the president in that restriction, it could have 
stated, “A representative and the president,” 
or included a similar provision in the article 
on the executive branch. But it does not.

Interpreting the Constitution — and any 

legal document — should remain faithful to 
the text. The text of the CSG Constitution is 
clear as to who is eligible to serve as president. 
Jim Harbaugh can serve as CSG president. 

— John Lin is a Public Policy graduate student.

Harbaugh as CSG president?

A

t the beginning of Sunday’s 
Democratic 
presidential 

debate in Flint, moderator 

Anderson Coo-
per 
informed 

his 
viewers 

about the cata-
strophic 
state 

of Flint’s water 
system.

“Now, we’ve 

come to Flint 
because this is 
a city in crisis,” 
Cooper said. “A 
city where, as 
you 
probably 

know, the tap 
water is toxic.”

In other words, Cooper was say-

ing that by conducting the debate 
here, the national media’s atten-
tion, and, by extension, the entire 
country’s attention, was turning to 
this city, perhaps as a way of show-
ing solidarity with the victims of the 
Flint water crisis. Throughout the 
rest of the debate, both candidates 
did allude to Flint and the need to 
give this city attention.

How much does it actually help 

the cause if we stage an event here 
— one single event — and then pack 
it all up and keep on kicking the can 
down the trail? In fact, I would argue 
that this whole debate distinctly 
hurts the Flint community. If only 
for a moment, it gives the American 
people the sense that we are doing 
enough, because the mainstream 
media and political establishment 
are giving this city the attention 
it deserves. For Christ’s sake, they 
even hosted a debate there! In that 
horrible, impoverished city! They 
must, then, really care!

One of the first questions posed 

at the debate dealt with the con-
crete action the candidates would 
take in Flint, long after this 
momentary spotlight dims. Ander-
son Cooper asked, “Why should 
the people of Flint believe that 
you aren’t just using this crisis to 
secure political points?”

In her response, Hillary Clin-

ton cited her long political career 
as evidence that she will be here to 
stay, that she genuinely cares about 
the people of Flint. “I think because 

throughout my public career I have 
been evening the odds for people 
in every way that I could,” Clinton 
said. “I will be with Flint all the way 
through this crisis…”

Upon 
further 
examination, 

Clinton’s rather meaningless and 
platitudinous statement about her 
loyalty to marginalized members 
of society does not hold weight. She 
was a fierce supporter of Bill Clin-
ton’s 1996 welfare reform, which 
sought to end “welfare as we know 
it.” Clinton’s reforms tore apart poor 
communities by severely limiting 
access to social security benefits and 
food stamps.

The crucially destructive element 

of Clinton’s reform, the Personal 
Responsibility and Work Opportu-
nity Reconciliation Act prohibited 
welfare to mothers under 18 years 
of age and denied aid for addition-
al children for mothers who were 
already on welfare. This legislation 
did allow for mothers in school to 
recieve welfare; however, it assumes 
that one has resources in her life to 
provide for a child and stay in school. 
Of course, this is only true for the 
most privileged among us. Clinton 
sought to create a system where, in 
order to receive welfare, one had 
to work or be in school. This was 
meant to promote individuality and 
productivity. Additionally, because 
of Clinton’s 1994 Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act, 
the largest crime legislation in this 
nation’s history, people returning 
from prison were received at home 
with disdain; Clinton’s legislation 
ignited the stigma that still sur-
rounds ex-prisoners today. Nobody 
would hire them. In turn, they could 
not receive welfare. The Clintons, 
together, created this vicious, unfor-
giving, dividing cycle that Michelle 
Alexander, among other scholars, 
has dubbed the New Jim Crow.

And yet, here Mrs. Clinton was 

on Sunday evening, spouting off 
once again a stump speech of sorts, 
deceitfully trying to convince resi-
dents of this city that she has always 
supported them, has always stood 
for those who face the longest odds.

Bernie Sanders, responding to 

the same question, discussed how 
he had met with residents of Flint 

to hear about their struggles: “(I 
held a) town meeting, which was as 
nonpolitical as I could make it, for 
hundreds of people to tell me and 
the world through the media exactly 
what was happening here in Flint.”

One member of this community 

who knowingly avoided Sanders’ 
private community meetings was 
Melissa Mays, the founder of Water 
You Fighting For, an activist group 
whose target is clean water. In an 
interview with John Whitesides, 
Mays explained her absence.

“I’m not going to be used like that. 

I’m not going to be a token. Do some-
thing first, then I’ll show up.”

Mays raises a crucial point: Sand-

ers — and the rest of the political 
arena — cannot expect everyday 
citizens to put their lives on hold to 
hear them speak, when Sanders and 
his colleagues have not reciprocated 
and have not taken action in the 
name of justice for these people. Of 
course, neither candidate has had 
the time or space to do anything 
concrete — they are each busy run-
ning a national campaign. But all of 
these words, from both candidates, 
given their past actions in relation to 
Flint or communities demographi-
cally similar to it, are absolutely 
meaningless. And so this debate 
cannot be the only national spotlight 
that Flint receives. It cannot be, for 
millions of us, our only exposure — 
I hesitate to even call it that — to 
what is going on in Flint and in mar-
ginalized communities across the 
country. We have an obligation to go 
forward, to do more, to educate our-
selves and to help in concrete ways 
that the political establishment is 
unable to match.

Both candidates’ flat responses, 

then, highlight the issue: Staging 
the debate in Flint on Sunday night 
does not help the cause because it 
does not concretely aid our suffer-
ing brothers and sisters in this rav-
aged city. If anything, the strategic 
staging of this political event numbs 
the national audience to its inaction. 
Ultimately, we are rendered more 
profoundly ignorant of, and improp-
erly content with, our inaction.

y feet drag across the cement, 
slowly shuffling before abruptly 
stopping to avoid face planting 

into a purple backpack. 
I take a deep breath, 
trying to calm myself. It 
is a passive aggressive 
breath. My sigh is due to 
the girl in front of me who 
is focused on her phone, 
her frozen fingers moving 
across the screen faster 
than mine ever could, the 
boy in front of her has 
frozen fingers, too, and 
so on. As if slow walkers 
were not enough, I looked 
all around me, seeing the Diag as a sea of 
individuals who are there but somewhere 
else — phones with people attached, a line 
of robots trudging to class.

Yet, I am a hypocrite. I do it, too. Even in 

rooms with clocks, I sometimes take out my 
phone to check the time and end up doing 
something else without even realizing it. 
Maybe it is the distraction I like. I grew 
up in a very rural community and the area 
of the woods I lived in did not receive the 
Internet well. My addiction may not be as 
profound as others’, simply because my 
technological skills lack comparatively, but 
I have watched more pointless YouTube 
videos since coming to college than would 
ever be considered necessary.

Lately, 
the 
ever-growing 
addiction 

and reliance on technology has become 
overwhelming. Time and history have shown 
us we can survive without technology, but 
what can we do about it now? Of course 
technology is not just mindlessly used, it 
has become an integral part of academic 
life and post-graduate hopes. As students, 
there are innumerable professional goals to 
be achieved, and with many fields utilizing 
the technology that has been developed, 
how rational is avoiding this emerging 

dependence? From the current access to 
online class materials to reserching for 
and writing letters, from networking to 
searching for employment opportunities, all 
together staying away from technology does 
not seem either possible or beneficial.

Despite this, I cannot help but feel pathetic 

(in addition to agitated) when I see the slow 
lull of text-shuffling, endless narcissistic 
selfies, and my own Facebook history, where 
it seems I have searched every person I have 
ever known. These habits often can waste 
time, distract from schoolwork, cause people 
to become more sedentary and lead to other 
negative effects. Sometimes I walk into walls 
when I am texting, but technology addiction 
can be truly dangerous. Thirty-three percent 
of adults admit to texting and driving, causing 
about nine deaths every day from cellphone-
related distracted driving. While we may not 
be able to completely detach, we should stop 
the compulsive behaviors that can be harmful.

Breaking habits is hard. I am 19 and still 

struggle with biting my nails when I am 
nervous, let alone conquering a fixation 
that seems to have overtaken our whole 
society. I always tell myself I’ll try to fix 
the problem starting tomorrow, always 
tomorrow. That’s just another way of 
technology sucking away our time. Luckily, 
some people find solutions where most 
do not. This May, I am participating in 
the New England Literature Program, a 
University of Michigan-sponsored program 
where students hike along the eastern coast, 
gaining nine English credits along the way, 
and which prohibits participants from 
using technology in order to encourage 
engagement with the tangible world around 
them. How great it must be to be given six 
weeks to form better, healthier habits.

With any luck, most of us will have at 

least six weeks to try something new.

W

hen I first began fill-
ing out required health 
and emergency contact 

forms to send to the University of 
Michigan as an undergraduate, my 
mom said to me, “Don’t just put 
your dad and me as emergency con-
tacts.” Seeing the confused look on 
my face, she went on to explain that 
of course she would like me to put 
her as one of my emergency con-
tacts, but given that I was going to 
be in Michigan, relatively far away 
from her and my dad who both live 
in California, they could be of very 
limited help in some situations. 
Someone else echoed a similar sen-
timent a little while later, when 
they advised us to have someone 
in-state for the University to con-
tact in an emergency. Though par-
ents want to help and will try to 
help, they may end up feeling hope-
less and all it may do is scare them.

In many ways, this made sense, 

but this thought resurfaced in my 
mind a few weeks ago. Trudging 
through the streets of Ann Arbor 
on my way to the library down-
town, excited to see Tiffany, a girl I 
tutor at Proyecto Avance. I glanced 
at my phone and saw an alert from 
a news station in my hometown that 
read, “Breaking: Child hit, killed 
by car in Richmond.” My natural 
reaction was, of course, sadness. 
And for the rest of the evening, I 
kept feeling an underlying sadness, 
which seeped into the time I always 
looked forward to with Tiffany. 
That was when I knew I needed a 
break from the 24-hour news cycle 
that has become all too prevalent 
with the advent of the smartphone 
and apps that give us access to news 

at the touch of a button. I needed a 
break.

This moment allowed me to 

reflect on how inundated I was 
with information: Partly because 
I had been working at the Daily, 
and knowledge of all current 
events seemed imperative, and 
partly because I subscribed to 
updates from five different news 
outlets: my hometown news sta-
tion (KTVU), CNN, The New York 
Times, MLive and BBC. In fact, a 
few weeks prior to this moment, 
I had been subscribed to updates 
from The Huffington Post as well. 
But walking back from tutoring 
that day, I realized I was still sub-
scribed to too many news alerts. 
Did I need to be alerted by CNN, 
The New York Times and BBC that 
Hillary Clinton won the South 
Carolina primary? Now that I was 
living in Michigan, why did I need 
to know there was a crash on the 
Bay Bridge and there was approxi-
mately a 30-minute backup get-
ting on to the bridge? Similarly, 
was it necessary or healthy for me 
to know about every shooting that 
went on in my hometown?

Before I go further, I want to 

stress that I’m not saying I want 
to be ignorant of what is going on 
in the world. Ignorance isn’t bliss. 
Ignorance is ignorance, and I don’t 
want to be ignorant. In fact, one 
of the advantages of having easy 
access to so much information is 
that you can stay informed, under-
stand what is going on in the world 
and participate actively in shaping 
the world. But I believe there is 
such a thing as being too informed 
— something that I only fully real-

ized recently.

A constant stream of infor-

mation isn’t just an option; it’s 
assumed that we want it this way. 
On my iPhone, unless I actively 
turn off notifications, I receive 
updates from every app that I 
download. This constant stream 
of information is also bad for our 
health: studies have shown that 
having access to all of this infor-
mation at the tip of our fingers 
increases stress. As an excessive 
worrier myself, I will do every 
little thing I can do to reduce my 
stress and improve my health.

I have since turned off notifica-

tions for the majority of news apps, 
forcing myself to pare it down to 
the most relevant news sources. 
There is something to be said for 
the proximity to an event.

At times it is better to not know 

everything going on in every corner 
of the Earth at every minute, espe-
cially if you have no ability to do 
anything about what has occurred. 
It is important to know the rates of 
pedestrian-car accidents, as it may 
help pass legislation, but learn-
ing that someone was hit by a car 
approximately 3,000 miles away 
from you is sad, and that’s just it. 
When I read it, I grieve for the 
child, the family, the life lost. But 
that is all I can do. I feel helpless — 
powerless and stressed — just as a 
parent would who was their out-of-
reach child’s only emergency con-
tact. Sometimes you need to tap out 
before you get tapped out.

Kendrick proves his 
legitimacy yet again

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

Now 
approaching 
its 
first 

birthday, To Pimp A Butterfly, 
Kendrick Lamar’s masterful soph-
omore album, 
remains 
as 

gripping 
as 

ever. As is 
the mark of 
a classic rap 
album, 
its 

knots contin-
ue to unfold 
with 
each 

new 
listen, 

and it’s doubtful that an album 
of such richness and density — in 
any genre — will eclipse it in the 
near future. untitled unmastered., 
a release of demos from that 
album, is a natural extension for a 
project with such grandeur.

That role is important to 

remember with this release — 
this is not a standalone Kendrick 
album. It’s perhaps his first offi-
cial project that can be played 
as effectively shuffled as front-
to-back. Indeed, lacking unique 
titles, many of the tracks can blend 
together like a single burst of jazz-
inspired spontaneity. Each, save 
“untitled 07,” are labeled with 
specific dates. Whether the tracks 
were completed in full on those 
dates or not, the sense of rapid, 
prodigal improvisation is never-
theless obvious on this release. 
Take the final part of “untitled 
07,” dated vaguely “2014-2016.” 
For nearly four minutes we hear 
Kendrick playing with spontane-
ous lyrics and tongue-in-cheek 

jokes, a look into his process of 
creation. Audio that closes out 
“untitled 02” sees Kendrick cor-
ralling his band together: “Who 
doing the drums?”

But along with the playful, 

tangential saxophones and the 
free-form jam sessions, untitled 
unmastered. above all underscores 
the meticulous perfectionism that 
has increasingly come to define 
Kendrick’s 
projects. 
“untitled 

03,” dated May 28, 2013, debuted 
on “The Colbert Report” over a 
year and a half later in Decem-
ber 2014. That version differs 
from the version here, released as 
“untitled 03.” The intro is absent, 
a drum pattern added, a saxo-
phone interlude replaced. Parts 
of the fourth verse from the live 
version of “untitled 08,” origi-
nally performed on “The Tonight 
Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” 
are moved to an entirely differ-
ent track, “untitled 02.” For a col-
lection of demos, it’s an unusual 
attention to detail.

That attention to detail and 

Kendrick’s undeniable rap genius 
produces an “unmastered” work 
that is far more effective than 
most rap albums could ever hope 
to be. “untitled 02,” a standout, 
is a characteristically TPAB-era-
dreamy track, with a one-liner 
that will surely be repeated con-
stantly over the next few months 
— “get Top on the phone!” The 
marathon of a second verse is 
one of the most impressive here, 
though it has plentiful company 
on this release.

“untitled 01,” the project open-

er, is another example of Kendrick 

rapping at the top of his game. 
Flying in after a lengthy inter-
lude, he wastes no time getting to 
business, describing at a dizzying 
speed a world of apocalypse and 
sin. “No more running from world 
wars, no more discriminating the 
poor,” he warns with an immedi-
acy reflective of our current state 
of affairs.

Kendrick’s enormous preoccu-

pation with the state of the world 
has exalted him above the lowly 
pettiness that’s sometimes com-
mon among rappers. “You n****s 
fear me like y’all fear God” he 
spits on “untitled 07,” a tease more 
than an actual insult. While much 
has been made of the apparent 
cold war between him and Drake, 
Kendrick hovers at a level that 
mainstream rap can’t touch.

Kendrick’s track record of con-

sistent excellence acts as both a 
testament to his skill as well as 
a warning to the previous rap 
kings. One can’t help but men-
tion Kanye West’s botched The 
Life of Pablo release. It’s no doubt 
a great album, but the separation 
between it and untitled unmas-
tered. is telling. Where TLOP 
is unusually messy for a Kanye 
West album, untitled unmastered., 
despite its off-the-cuff nature, is 
yet another measured and cohe-
sive release by Kendrick. Where 
TLOP was at times misguided 
(yes, that Taylor Swift line), Ken-
drick has yet to make a misstep.

Plenty of rappers jostle to sit at 

the high throne of rap. But when 
the rhetoric subsides and the talent 
sits alone, it’s Kendrick’s claim that 
holds the most legitimacy today. 

FILM REVIEW
A charming, sweet 
caper in ‘Zootopia’

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

Daily Arts Writer

Most college students crave 

Spring Break because it’s a hiatus 
from the heavy class load and per-
mits countless 
hours of sleep. 
But 
for 
me, 

Spring 
Break 

is that marvel-
ous time when 
I finally have 
companionship 
for my moviego-
ing. Ever since 
the 
trailer’s 

release, I anticipated my nine-
year-old brother and 11-year old-
sister’s fondness for the big-eyed, 
floppy-eared creatures of “Zooto-
pia,” but I didn’t foresee it as being 
anything other than “cute yet pre-
dictable.” I was wrong. 

The story centers on an ambi-

tious and intelligent bunny, Judy 
Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin, “Once 
Upon a Time”), whose big dreams 
of becoming a police officer are 
constantly crushed by both her 
parents and the rest of society. 
Being a petite female, she’s not 
favored to survive working as 
a cop. Despite these odds, Judy 
makes it to Zootopia, the land of 
opportunity, where she starts out 
as a meter maid but soon finds 
herself working the case of a life-
time when once friendly preda-
tors start turning into “savages.” 
Of course, she gets assistance 
from her perceived enemy, the sly 

yet surprisingly faithful fox, Nick 
Wilde (Jason Bateman, “Arrested 
Development”). 

The romantic subplot thrives 

on its realistic qualities. Nick 
and Judy smoothly transition 
from adversaries to compan-
ions; however, as in many human 
relationships, Judy’s ignorance 
temporarily destroys the bond 
they share. Now, while this really 
is Judy’s tale, Bateman’s vocal 
work proves Nick to be the more 
intriguing character. Bateman 
maintains a smooth voice, pro-
viding an essential believability 
to the slyness of his character. He 
also does a great job evolving Nick 
through his tonality. Initially, 
Nick’s endearing tone dupes Judy 
into thinking he’s an innocent, 
loving dad just trying to buy an 
ice pop for his young son, but the 
moment he leaves the ice cream 
shop he reveals his hustling 
ways. Gradually, this tough exte-
rior crumbles, revealing a humble, 
caring friend.

Directors 
Byron 
Howard 

(“Tangled”), Rich Moore (“Wreck-
It Ralph”) and co-director Jared 
Bush (“Big Hero 6”) make Zooto-
pian society incredibly believable 
by presenting human frustra-
tions, such as the slowness of the 
DMV, in a way that makes sense 
for animals to be experiencing 
them, i.e. having the DMV’s staff 
be composed entirely of sloths. 
There’s also more subtle humor 
found in a shifty weasel’s collec-
tion of pirated DVDs and a mono-

rail that has three different doors 
to accommodate for the varying 
animal sizes (tall, average and 
tiny). To mimic our heavy reli-
ance on technology, all the ani-
mals carry smartphones — even 
the evil henchmen (who use the 
devices to take selfies with their 
captives). 

On a more serious note, “Zoo-

topia” demonstrates how danger-
ous stereotyping can be. Many 
“little guys” are regarded as 
inefficient and thus deprived of 
power in the workplace, which 
often leads to their involvement in 
illegal endeavors, namely drugs. 
This issue is one that’s heavily 
sanitized, but easily understood 
by the older audience. Don Cor-
leone’s appearance is easily one 
of the best moments of the entire 
film. (I’ll let you guess which ani-
mal they use to portray him.) If a 
“Godfather” reference in an ani-
mated Disney movie doesn’t leave 
you flabbergasted, just know that 
there’s a “Breaking Bad” refer-
ence too.

An almost flawless combination 

of film noir, comedy and romance, 
“Zootopia” plays against viewer’s 
expectations to keep all ages 
entranced to the very end. But, 
don’t just take it from me, take it 
from the words of my observant 
brother: “Well, Rachel always 
tells me that movies I enjoy are 
so predictable so it was hilarious 
when she basically yelled, ‘I can’t 
believe they did that!’ like every 
ten seconds.”

ALBUM REVIEW

T

here’s this song on the 
“Hamilton” soundtrack 
called “Who Lives, Who 

Dies, Who Tells Your Story” 
that I’ve been listening to 
obsessively 
since I saw 
the musical 
last Friday. 
(This will 
not be the 
last time I 
openly brag 
about having 
seen “Ham-
ilton.” With 
the original 
cast. The 
room where 
it happens! I’m done for now.) I 
listen to the song in line at Chi-
potle, or in the shower; I belt 
it at pregames for Kerrytown 
house parties like I’m running 
out of time.

But if I’m listening in public, 

I have to turn off the part of 
my brain that digests the lyr-
ics, because the song is actu-
ally sad as hell. Eliza Hamilton 
sings about her efforts to 
preserve her husband’s legacy, 
to get through the 50 years 
she’s forced to live without 
her Alexander — the love of 
her life, that master of words 
who never ceased to amaze 
her. Fifty years a widow. At the 
end of the song, Eliza hopes 
she has done enough, that she 
has sufficiently preserved and 
curated the life they’d have 
built together if only he’d been 
around to live out that life with 
her. If you see me weeping 
in the Chipot-line, have pity, 
because I am definitely crying 
into my $10 bill.

You have no control who 

lives, who dies, who tells your 
story.

It’s a terrifying thought, hav-

ing your story pulled from your 
own hands, your pen interrupt-
ed. Speaking as someone who, 
like Alexander Hamilton, has 
documented their life through 
copious handwritten plans 
(of weekly TV schedules) and 
affectionate messages to pals 
(typed on my iPhone, at 3 a.m., 
while I wait for the microwave 
to heat up a leftover omelet), 
it’s hard to imagine a future 
where I’m not writing bi-week-
ly, self-indulgent feeling dumps 
about how I love television, 
where all that’s left for people 
to remember me by is a handful 
of TV columns and some term 
papers. Before I started writ-
ing this column, I counted the 
number of weeks left that my 
column will run before the end 
of the semester. It’s only four, 
including this one. I’ve got to 
make my words count, because 
I won’t always be around to 
write more of them.

It seems like all the TV I’ve 

been watching lately is saturat-
ed with goodbyes and endings 
— Shoshanna leaving Japan 
on “Girls,” Coach Taylor mov-
ing to Austin for a hot second 
on “Friday Night Lights,” the 
“Mad Men” finale, which I stu-
pidly re-watched last night in 
an effort to quell the nostalgia 
blues I’ve been feeling lately 
(obviously, this strategy did not 
work). But the most poignant 
of the goodbye parades, oddly 
enough, was on “New Girl.”

Megan Fox’s character, 

whom I praised in this column 
a few weeks back, exited the 
show and moved out of the loft 
in Tuesday’s episode. With 
Nick’s crush on Reagan finally 
consummated, her leaving 
couldn’t have come at a worse 
or more dramatic time. Though 
their time together was brief 
— Fox was only on the show 
for five episodes — Nick felt a 
real connection with Reagan, 
and wants her to remember 

him. He wants his legacy to 
mean something, and he thinks 
the best way to do this is by 
crafting the perfect goodbye. 
He and Schmidt discuss how 
to write the perfect “goose-
bumps walk-away,” “the line 
that haunts her, that consumes 
her, that rings in her ear for 
all eternity, granting you … 
immortality.”

This line, which Schmidt 

murmurs with a murderous 
pitch as he stares into Nick’s 
eyes, is played for laughs. But 
there’s some truth in that state-
ment, in the power of a good 
goosebumps walk-away. Words 
are immortality. Being remem-
bered by the people you love is 
immortality. There’s no death 
or goodbye or sadness if that 
person’s words are bouncing 
around in your brain every day, 
if you can retrieve their words 
and think about them. Words 
are scripts for memories, 
approximations that can tide 
you over when that person is 
not around to provide you with 
new words. They’re what’s left.

When you’re gone who 

remembers your name? Who 
keeps your flame?

Whenever I watch “Ameri-

can Crime Story: The People 
Vs. O.J. Simpson,” I wonder 
what Robert Kardashian and 
Johnnie Cochran might have 
thought of the show. In the 
20-odd years since the real 
trial took place, Kardashian 
and Cochran are the only two 
major players who have passed 
away. They don’t have the 
chance to re-tell their stories, 
and their characterization is 
entirely in the hands of Ryan 
Murphy and the rest of the 
show’s creative team. I won-
der what Kardashian would 
have thought about being 
played, with Ross Geller-esque 
best-friend moping, by David 
Schwimmer, or about how his 
honor is contrasted with the 
fame-hungry personalities of 
the other Kardashians. Would 
Cochran want to be remem-
bered as a cutthroat manipu-
lator, an anti-discrimination 
warrior or a loving father? I 
can’t imagine the real Marcia 
Clark, who actually endured 
the sexism and media attention 
that the show portrays, enjoys 
the TV show’s speculation 
about her romantic involve-
ment with her co-counsel, 
Christopher Darden.

“American Crime Story” is 

a brilliant and endlessly fas-
cinating show, but in writing 
real people as sensationalized 
characters, the show begins to 
cross into an ethical grey area. 
What’s the real truth? What’s 
written-down evidence — and 
what’s just the TV narrative 
that’s presented for us as view-
ers? The show sparked my curi-
osity enough for me to check 
out the nonfiction book the TV 
show is based on, “The Run of 
His Life” by Jeffrey Toobin. 
Being a journalist, I know that 
there is a version of every story, 
and the closest thing you can 
do to unearthing the facts is 
hearing as many sides of the 
story as possible. I’m excited to 
read the book after I graduate, 
when I’m not so busy writing 
and have more time to read.

It’s a terrifying thought, 

having your story pulled from 
your own hands. I don’t want 
to think about all the free time 
I’ll have to read this summer, 
at home in Illinois or in the 
ghostly Ann Arbor with all my 
friends moving to big cities or 
working dream internships. I 
don’t want to think that this 
time isn’t even guaranteed 
— that my narcissistic youth 
doesn’t take into account 
everything that could change if 
somebody blows a red light or 

challenges me to a duel.

I don’t want to think about 

my words as clues or history or 
imagine someone else reading 
this column the way I some-
times revisit an old friend’s 
published work, desperate for 
a shadow and a memory of 
the way their humor and their 
brain used to work. I don’t 
want someone picking up my 
written tics like I’ve picked 
theirs up, almost subconscious-
ly, like my keyboard is driving 
me to tell their story and make 
new words that might do them 
proud. I like to think of myself 
as being everywhere at once, 
always talking and always 
writing, and it scares me more 
than anything else to think 
that I’m running out of time 
and space on the page. That it’ll 
be someone else’s headshot five 
lines down in the TV column, 
someone else in my favorite 
chair and other people there 
in the moment and talking and 
writing, and me off somewhere 
without a pen and hoping 
somebody’s still thinking about 
me, remembering me fiercely 
and reading the words I’ve left 
as clues, finishing the story I’d 
only just started writing.

You really do write like you’re 

running out of time.

When I saw “Hamilton” in 

New York City last week (I told 
you this wouldn’t be the last 
you heard of it), there was an 
overwhelming power about 
being in a room with hundreds 
of other sniffling, tissue-wield-
ing fans during that last song of 
the show, standing on the prec-
ipice of a moment and watch-
ing time go by from the second 
mezzanine, the very back of the 
theatre with my seat against 
the wall. From the top, I could 
feel the minute hand on my 
watch scraping across its face, 
the night inching forward like 
that progress bar at the bottom 
of the Netflix player screen.

I felt time receding into his-

tory just as everything was 
happening. The show I’d been 
waiting for three months to 
see was ending, the last Spring 
Break of my undergraduate 
years coming to a close, the 
curtain falling over my senior 
year. The performance I saw 
exists now only in the memo-
ries of the people who were 
there — and unless somebody 
recorded the thing on their 
phone, I’ll never see what hap-
pened onstage that night ever 
again.

Isn’t the same true of every 

night?

I thought of the lyrics from 

the Vampire Weekend song I’d 
been listening to earlier that 
day: “I want to know, does it 
bother you? / The long click 
of the ticking clock / There’s a 
lifetime right in front of you / 
And everyone I know.”

It does bother me. I want 

to do enough, to make enough 
memories, and write enough 
stories, that these moments 
might live on even after they 
pass. I hope I’ve done enough.

After the show, at the stage 

door, I looked around — at my 
two joyful friends, the glitter-
ing city rising up before me, the 
other fans begging for auto-
graphs and selfies with Daveed 
Diggs, the “Hamilton” post-
ers in my hands and the great 
swaths of time behind and 
before me, all those opportuni-
ties to write and tell my story. 
There’s so much time, so much 
to say and accomplish.

How lucky I am to have 

three more columns and six 
more weeks to do it all.

“

Y’all see, how these bogus 
n****s try not to notice the 
dopest bitches?”

The question, posed by Da Brat, 

alludes to a fact rap fans are all 
far too familiar with: the hip-hop 
industry is 
male-domi-
nated (in other 
news, water 
is wet). Brat’s 
point is that 
no matter how 
dope a female 
rapper may be, 
it’s unlikely 
for her to get 
the credit she 
deserves.

And with 

that, the visibility of women in hip 
hop dwindles. And when you aren’t 
seeing (because you aren’t exposed 
to) many female rappers, you notice 
a pattern and construct this notion 
in your mind of what a rapper 
should look like — a man. The cycle 
continues and even the “dopest 
bitches” fall by the wayside.

The question asked by Brat-tat-

tat-tat comes from her opening 
line on “Not Tonight (Ladies Night 
Remix).” A summer anthem back 
in 1997, the hit was Lil Kim’s third 
consecutive number one on Bill-
board’s Rap Songs chart. It’s not 
surprising if you look at the all-star 
line-up: Lil Kim, the “Queen Bitch” 
of Bad Boy and, at one point, the 
Queen of Hip Hop as well; Da Brat, 
So So Def superstar whose Funk-
dafied rhymes led her to become 
the first female solo rapper to go 
platinum; the late, great Lisa “Left 
Eye” Lopes, known for the color-
ful commentary she contributed 
as a member of the best-selling 
American girl group in the his-
tory of American girl groups, TLC; 
multifaceted Angie Martinez, who 
has a string of hits to her name, but 
is more so revered for her role in 
radio, historically being Hot 97’s 
leading lady. Oh, and Missy fuck-
ing Elliot, whose ’97 debut Supa 
Dupa Fly still sounds like some shit 
straight out of 2050. Still.

So what gives? There’s tons of 

talented, boundary-breaking rap-
pers out there who happen to be 
women, yet their contributions 
(which are massive, and we’ll get to 
that) go unrecognized.

Some of the struggle to be 

acknowledged is due to socializa-

tion telling us to only take male 
rappers seriously. On her CRWN 
interview with Elliot Wilson, 
Nicki Minaj let the music journal-
ist have it when he brought up her 
verse on “Monster,” objectively the 
most impressive verse on the track 
(this is the same song where Hov 
babbles off the names of a bunch 
of creatures of the night and calls 
it a verse, and we all collectively 
decided to suppress that from our 
memory). Some people (me) would 
say Nicki not only stole the song, 
but the album. But this isn’t the 
first time Nicki both graced and 
put the fear of God into us with her 
lyrical prowess.

“I feel like a lot of people only 

accepted it because Kanye and 
Jay were on there,” Nicki said. 
Elliot shared that Nicki’s animated 
approach and use of alter-egos 
didn’t resonate with him … until 
“Monster.”

“Because if I were on there by 

myself, y’all wouldn’t have given 
me my props,” she said. “I been 
ill… I didn’t get ill [from] ‘Monster,’ 
I was ill before.” Nicki implied 
that “Monster” was the first time 
many people flirted with the idea 
of being Nicki fans because it was 
the first time many people really 
listened. And they listened because 
people they respected (referring 
to Ye, Hov and Ross — a.k.a. men) 
co-signed.

Another obstacle that delays 

recognition, stemming from 
gender biases determining cred-
ibility, has to do with support. If 
you aren’t taken seriously, there’s 
a likely chance you won’t receive 
a sufficient amount of support to 
breach the mainstream and attain 
an audience adequate enough for 
you to really eat off of.

In the music industry, this looks 

like your albums being shelved in 
favor of a man’s. If you’re at the 
bottom of the totem pole, you’re 
going to have to wait. And this 
waiting either ends or seriously 
limits the longevity of what could 
otherwise have been a flourishing 
career. Case in point: the afro-
puff-wearing, “unfucwitable” and 
lethally lyrical Lady of Rage.

Brat was the first female rap-

per to go platinum, yet it very well 
could have been Rage. But Death 
Row fucked up. At this point in 
time, Dre’s classic Chronic had 
been released; Snoop can be heard 

on what feels like every song, and 
this was purposeful. The place-
ment was an introduction — a way 
of catapulting Snoop onto the scene 
and implying that he had next.

As planned, Doggystyle debuted 

a year later, solidifying Snoop’s 
place in the game. In similar fash-
ion, Dre used Doggystyle to prepare 
listeners for who would follow 
Snoop. Thus, “R-A-G to the moth-
erfuckin E” is the first to spit on “G 
Funk Intro.” But this time, the plan 
fell apart.

Rage’s Roughness was shelved 

and, instead, Daz and Kurupt got 
to ride the wave of attention and 
acclaim with their release of Dogg 
Food. Roughness wouldn’t see the 
light of day for two more years, and 
by that point, Dre left, Suge was 
incarcerated and Pac was mur-
dered. In other words, Death Row 
was falling apart.

Rage shared, “I didn’t have the 

conductor and I didn’t have the 
same help that everyone else had 
when it was time for their albums 
to be produced … Everybody came 
in and contributed for The Chronic, 
Doggystyle and Dogg Food. Every-
body came in for ‘Above the Rim’ 
and ‘Murder Was the Case.’ When 
it was my turn, it was just me.”

It should be stated, though, that 

Rage was brought on to the label 
with good intent. She recorded 
some bars for an L.A. Posse tape. 
Dre heard her verses and immedi-
ately flew her out to California, and 
she was inducted into Death Row. 
Though her career was misman-
aged, the significance of men with 
power in the music industry high-
lighting, and thus normalizing, the 
presence of women rappers is vital 
and should be encouraged.

Ice Cube did this with his pro-

tégé Yo-Yo. She went toe-to-toe 
with him on “It’s A Man’s World” 
from AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted 
and held her own. She demanded 
respect in her verse: “Give us credit 
like you should / If I don’t look 
good then you don’t look good.” 
And she demanded respect in real 
life, letting Cube know he wasn’t 
going to get away with referring 
to her as a bitch in his bars. And 
he listened. A year after she was 
formally introduced via her guest 
feature, Yo-Yo released her debut 
Make Way for the Motherlode, 
chock full of uplifting messages, 
sharp delivery and one of the best 

rap joints of all time: “You Can’t 
Play With My Yo-Yo.”

Without such support, some of 

our favorite artists would still be 
working the underground circuit, 
waiting for their chance.

Imagine if the Ruff Ryders 

dismissed Eve when she flew out 
to New York to audition for a spot 
in their crew. Eve wrote her own 
rhymes — rhymes that stung. 
After all, she was introduced to 
hip hop through battle rapping 
on the block with friends. And 
though she did have to work twice 
as hard at first to prove herself as 
a woman, Ruff Ryders made sure 
their first lady got the attention she 
deserved, making sure to not only 
include her, but also oftentimes 
center her.

Whether it’s fellow male rappers 

in the game like Ice Cube, or leg-
endary label executives like Sylvia 
Rhone — who played a crucial role 
in launching Missy Elliott’s career, 
all the while encouraging Misde-
meanor to preserve her progressive 
and eclectic style — the support 
of gatekeepers is crucial. Because 
when women rappers don’t receive 
the recognition they deserve, one 
of two things (oftentimes both) 
happens: either their impact on 
the culture is overlooked or we, as 
listeners, miss out on some purely 
dope content. Both suck — whether 
it’s their loss or ours.

A great example: Before Cube 

put Yo-Yo on, he himself played a 
role in the neglect of female rap-
pers’ contribution to the culture. 
Most people’s conception of Ruth-
less Records is limited to N.W.A. 
and Bone Thugs, but before N.W.A. 
could introduce themselves to the 
world, the credibility of Ruthless 
had to be solidified. J.J. Fad, an all-
female rap group, were integral in 
doing just that. In ’88, their debut 
album was a smash. It was easier to 
digest than gangsta rap — and this 
was the motive — but it proved to 
be phenomenal in its own right.

The album would become War-

ner’s first platinum hit, while the 
single “Supersonic” had an impact 
beyond the rap scene; an interpola-
tion of the track was used for Fer-
gie’s “Fergalicious.” Don’t give Ferg 
too much credit for her flow in 
her song either — sounds awfully 
similar to Fad’s. Sadly, J.J. Fad 
wasn’t included in the “Straight 
Outta Compton” biopic last year, 
which many people felt was plain 
foul. Thus, Juana, Juanita, Fatima, 
Anna and Dania’s names are for-
gotten, even though their impact is 
undeniable.

And to my last point — about 

how we as listeners deny ourselves 
of some of the best content out 
there by maintaining a limited 
concept of who or what a rapper is 
and looks like — well, there’s too 
many examples to list. Though Eve 
got to shine, fellow Philly native 
Bahamadia is criminally under-
rated. Her debut Kollage consists 
of wordplay that doesn’t let you 
rest, complemented by laid-back, 
bohemian beats. Guru describes it 
as “a collection of lyrical and musi-
cal art that brings forth a masterful 
contribution to the hip-hop world” 
on the interlude. And he’s not over-
selling it a bit.

Whether it’s cool and composed 

Ladybug Mecca and Lauryn Hill, 
or southern superstars Diamond, 
Princess and Gangsta Boo, women 
rappers offer the same range and 
versatility, if not more so, than 
male counterparts. Women like 
Jean Grae have established a 
capacity for longevity, while up-
and-comers like Junglepussy con-
tinue to push creative boundaries 
and infuse rap with the radical and 
forward-thinking dynamism that 
critics claim corporatization wiped 
out of it.

While most of us aren’t in the 

same position as the gatekeepers 
I mentioned, we do occupy a posi-
tion that is just as important: the 
listeners, lovers and consumers of 
the genre. If we deconstruct our 
conceptions of who belongs in rap, 
expand our palate and expose our-
selves to dope women rappers, we 
could realistically initiate a move-
ment starting at the grassroots 
— one that shakes the structure at 
its core and demands the incorpo-
ration and recognition that female 
rappers deserve.

A bit optimistic, I admit, but 

how much longer could we go 
without noticing the dopest 
bitches?

EVENT PREVIEW
Showcase of 
student work

By MARIA ROBINS-SOMER-

VILLE

Daily Arts Writer

No Michigan student is a 

stranger to the flurry of flyers 
and enthusiastic cries on the Diag 
at rush hour. 
In their open-
ing scene, the 
cast 
members 

of the Writers’ 
Showcase play 
off that, promis-
ing everything 
from 
bikini 

bodies, to a life-
time supply of 
pizza, to Donald 
Trump’s blood. 
They create the 
zany from the familiar location of 
the Diag.

The Writers’ Showcase, a col-

laborative project spearheaded by 
LSA freshman Christine Covode 
and LSA sophomore Maggie Lott, 
features student-written works 
adapted to the stage. The scenes 
mix drama and comedy, with a 
focus on themes that appeal to the 
average University of Michigan 
student.

They address first loves, obses-

sion, frat-bros, turtlenecks and 
football players, all in the space 
of an hour and a half celebration 
of undergraduate writing. Some 
pieces are clearly written for the 
stage, while others are poetry or 
spoken word, which have a more 
abstract narrative outline.

Covode and Lott brought the 

idea of a Writer’s Showcase from 
their high school in Evanston, IL, 
which has a yearly production 
that is written, directed and acted 
by students. Both participated as 
performers and now have decided 
to found and co-direct a similar 
project here at the University. 

The directors started the pro-

cess by soliciting writing from 
peers and writing some of their 
own scenes as well.

“We asked for pretty much 

any type of written work, poetry, 
dialogues, monologues, narra-
tives, anything. A lot of them were 
scenes. Maggie wrote a few. I 

wrote a few. We co-wrote some of 
them together, ” Covode said.

The process of putting together 

the showcase has been completely 
student-led and flexible, allowing 
space for dialogue and revision 
between students.

“The whole thing is pretty 

much a collaborative process. We 
ask our crew ‘what do you guys see 
in this scene?’ We are not going to 
sit there and say ‘this is about this 
and that is it,’” Covode said.

The rehearsal process reflects 

this mentality, as Covode and 
Lott sometimes take a backseat 
to allow actors and writers to 
take agency over their decisions 
regarding how they would like to 
convey the emotion and story of 
their work.

The showcase mixes physical 

comedy with more still and slow 
moments of spoken word to sim-
ply honor the visceral emotion of 
the writing.

“We develop an interpretation 

as a group and we just kind of 
stage it out. Some of them are just 
people standing on a stage and 
some are more acted out,” Lott 
said.

The technical aspects of the 

show are minimal. There are 
hardly any sets and the actors 
wear simple uniform costumes 
that allow them to play different 
roles in different scenes. Lott and 
Covode intend to celebrate stu-
dent writing through stage adap-
tation and although they value 
their hardworking and imagi-
native crew of performers, they 
hope to convey a message that 
goes beyond the humble scope of 
the production.

Covode said through partici-

pating in Writers’ Showcase, she 
realized the heart of the project-
was the work.

“You are so small compared to 

what this person is saying. It’s a 
tribute to this person’s writing.”

Through the empowerment of 

collaboration and the vulnerabil-
ity that comes with letting your 
own writing fall into the hands 
of others, The Writers’ Showcase 
creates an honest and dynamic 
community.

‘M’ wins tourney opener

Irvin’s late jumper 
sends Michigan to 

quarterfinals

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

INDIANAPOLIS — In a game 

filled with big shots, a player 
whose coaches call him “Big 
Shot” made 
the biggest 
shot of all.

Junior 

forward Zak Irvin’s twisting, 
mid-range jumper with three 
seconds remaining in overtime 
gave Michigan a 72-70 win and a 
berth in the Big Ten Tournament 
quarterfinals, setting up a Friday 
clash with top-seeded Indiana 
that gives the Wolverines a final 
opportunity to punch an NCAA 
Tournament ticket.

Playing in his home state, a 

short drive from his home town, 
Irvin wanted the basketball, and 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
made sure to give it to him on 
the Wolverines’ final offensive 
possession.

“The guys had been joking 

around, on the bus and earlier 
today, that since this is my home 
town, saying this is my city,” 
Irvin said. “I was just jumping 
around with them, saying that 
(again), after I made the play.”

Early on, it seemed that 

Irvin’s big shot wouldn’t be 
necessary. As it opened up a 
13-point lead early in the first 
half, Michigan seemed poised 
to coast to victory, rest its 
starters and enter tomorrow’s 
matchup 
at 
least 
somewhat 

rested. 
Redshirt 
sophomore 

forward Duncan Robinson was 
shooting 3-pointers, sophomore 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman was scoring inside and 
out, and Michigan’s defensive 
energy shut down Northwestern 

center Alex Olah.

Olah had other ideas, riding 

Northwestern’s 
second-half 

rally 
into 
the 
game’s 
final 

minute, when he cut Michigan’s 
lead to one point with a 3 from 
the left wing, then sent the game 
to overtime on a putback with 0.1 
seconds remaining.

Olah 
entered 
the 
game 

averaging 22 points in his last 
three tries against Michigan, 
but was limited in the first half 
to just two points and three 
rebounds, in large part because 
redshirt junior Mark Donnal was 
able to repeatedly swat rebounds 
inches away from Olah’s grasp to 
the perimeter.

“That’s just the way it played 

out,” Donnal said, comparing 
the first half to Olah’s 19-point 
performance on Feb. 24 at 
Crisler Center. “We had a better 
game plan going in on Olah. We 
had a little more help this game.”

Olah 
finished 
strong 
and 

ended up with 20 points and 13 

rebounds, again in a losing effort. 
Northwestern’s 
Trey 
Demps 

tied Robinson for a game-high 
21 points, while Irvin and the 
Wildcats’ Bryant McIntosh each 
scored 19 and Abdur-Rahkman 
scored 14.

Robinson could easily have had 

22, but he missed a critical free 
throw that would have put the 
game away late in the second half.

Charity-stripe 
miss 

notwithstanding, Beilein didn’t 
hesitate to dial his number in 
overtime, and the gamble paid 
off. Robinson’s 3-pointers in the 
overtime period’s first and last 
minutes helped the Wolverines 
avoid disaster, and the second 
set up Irvin’s game-winner.

“I told him, ‘We’re going 

right back at you,’ ” Beilein said. 
“ ‘You’re going to get 3s to help 
us win the game.’ Exactly what 
I said. … We needed to pick 
everybody up, and he was one of 
the guys that we looked in the eye 
and said, ‘You’re gonna bounce 

back and help us win this game.’ ”

Michigan, notorious in recent 

years for its struggles inbounding 
the basketball, needed three 
tries to get the ball in against a 
ferocious Northwestern press, 
but eventually got the ball in to 
Robinson, who got away with 
a travel and made a pair of free 
throws to give Michigan another 
two-point lead.

“Yeah, that was ugly again, 

wasn’t it?” Beilein said of his 
team’s recurring struggles on 
inbounds plays.

Michigan didn’t win in the 

way it wanted to, given the early 
lopsidedness and its game less 
than 24 hours from now. Irvin, 
Abdur-Rahkman 
and 
Walton 

played 42, 41 and 41 minutes, 
respectively, meaning they won’t 
have fresh legs for tomorrow’s 
win-or-go-home clash against 
Indiana.

For 
now, 
however, 
the 

Wolverines are simply happy to 
be alive.

Indiana awaits 

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

INDIANAPOLIS — The first 

thing that comes to mind when 
Michigan fans think of No. 10 
Indiana 
is 

the 25-0 first-
half run that 
effectively 
ended 
the 

teams’ 
Feb. 

2 
contest 
at 

halftime. 

The 

Wolverines 
came out of the 
Crisler 
Center 

locker 
room 

to 
claw 
back 

from a 21-point 
deficit, but the 
Hoosiers — specifically guards 
Yogi Ferrell and Robert Johnson — 
were too much for the Wolverines. 

But that was a month ago.
Friday, Michigan (10-8 Big 

Ten, 
21-11 
overall), 
will 
get 

the chance to face the Big Ten 
champion Hoosiers (15-3, 25-6) 
in Indianapolis in the Big Ten 
Tournament quarterfinals with 
the team’s postseason fate hanging 
in the balance. 

After 
a 
down-to-the-wire 

victory over Northwestern on 
Thursday, the Wolverines will 
have to recoup and recover quickly 
before the Friday matchup. 

“We gotta rest right now,” said 

Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“We gotta rest and get ready 
for tomorrow. We’ll have shoot 
around time here — we won’t use 
it — we’ll just walk and talk and 
watch clips of the Indiana game, 
as well as watch for similarities 
between this game and what 
Indiana will do.”

The Wolverines can’t afford 

that kind of run right now, with 
an NCAA Tournament bid on the 
line.

“That run was something crazy, 

for sure,” said redshirt sophomore 

guard Duncan Robinson following 
Thursday’s 
game 
against 

Northwestern. “They have a lot of 
firepower on the offensive end, so 
we (have to) just try to make them 
uncomfortable, don’t let them get 
easy catches, that sort of thing. 
Yogi Ferrell is a great player, so you 
do what you can to try to take him 
out of his groove. I’m sure Coach B 
is already thinking about the game 
plan for that sort of thing, so we’re 
excited for it.”

The Hoosiers have four players 

scoring in double digits, and they 
will also be coming off a five-day 
break from game action. 

Sophomore guard Muhammad-

Ali Abdur-Rahkman noted that 
the Wolverines would have to 
key in on defense on Friday if 
they want a chance. After all, the 
Hoosiers are averaging 82.7 points 
per game compared to Michigan’s 
74.8 points.

“They’re a great team and can 

put five guys out there on the court 
who can all shoot the ball,” Abdur-
Rahkman said. “You gotta play 
tough on defense and you’ve gotta 
be more on the help and in the 
gaps and things like that.”

Junior forward Zak Irvin 

added more to Michigan’s defense 
on Thursday, grabbing eight 
boards while also scoring the 
Wolverines’ winning jumper and 
logging 42 minutes in his home 
state of Indiana. Friday, Irvin 
will hope to lead the Wolverines 
against the Hoosiers as he did 
on Feb. 2, but with a different 
outcome in mind. 

Though 
the 
Hoosiers 
will 

effectively have a home crowd 
against Michigan in Indianapolis, 
Irvin will, too. 

“It helped (Irvin) a little 

bit,” Abdur-Rahkman said. “A 
little 
home-court 
advantage 

kind of thing. Playing in your 
hometown definitely helps, and 
it gives you that extra chip and 
that extra grit that you want to 
win the game.”

Robinson leads ‘M’

By SIMON KAUFMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

INDIANAPOLIS — After the 

Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
overtime win versus Northwestern 
in its first day of play at the Big Ten 
Tournament, redshirt sophomore 
guard Duncan Robinson described 
the game as one with “a lot of ebbs 
and flows.”

The game, in some way, was 

a perfect picture of Robinson’s 
season — one with ebb and flow.

Robinson started the season as 

Michigan’s most lethal option from 
deep and turned heads early on for 
his ability to hit from anywhere 
beyond the arc. But as the season 
wore on, it appeared as if Robinson 
had lost his stroke.

Going into Michigan’s game 

against 
Rutgers 
on 
Jan. 
27, 

Robinson was shooting better than 
50 percent from 3-point range. In 
the Wolverines’ final 10 games to 
close out the regular season, he 
shot worse than 30 percent from 
deep, struggling to find his rhythm.

Thursday, 
at 
Bankers 
Life 

Fieldhouse, it looked as though 
Robinson’s season was playing out 
in a single game. In the first half, 
the 6-foot-8 guard couldn’t miss. 
He drained his first try from deep 
to help Michigan push out to an 
early 11-3 lead.

“I just think when he makes his 

first or second shot, he may be a 
little bit more — have more energy 
to shoot it again, have a better 
attitude about shooting it again,” 
said Michigan coach John Beilein.

Later in the half, when a 

3-point opportunity wasn’t there, 
Robinson 
didn’t 
hesitate. 
He 

dribbled in and knocked down a 
jumper. Two minutes later, when 
the defense was tough on him from 
deep again, he pump faked and 
drove to the hoop, drawing a foul. 
On Michigan’s next possession, he 
drew another foul, this time from 
beyond the arc. He knocked down 
all of his free throws, picking up 
five points from the charity stripe 
in a span of 19 seconds.

Robinson finished the half with 

14 points on 4-for-5 from the field. 
In the second half, though, much 
like in the second half of Michigan’s 
season, Robinson was a nonfactor.

With 
14 
seconds 
left 
and 

Michigan 
up 
one 
point, 

Northwestern fouled Robinson 
to send him to the line. Robinson 
made the front end of a 1-and-1 
opportunity — his first point of the 
half — but couldn’t convert on the 
backend, setting up Northwestern 
center Alex Olah for a put-back 
basket that forced overtime.

Between the end of regulation 

and the extra five-minute period, 
senior guard Spike Albrecht made 
sure to tell Robinson to keep his 
head up.

“I was just like, ‘Keep your 

head up, man,’ ” Albrecht said. “I 
think he kinda blamed himself. So 
I was like, ‘Dude, you’re fine. Stay 
confident. We’re going to get you 
shots in overtime.’ ”

Beilein shared a similar message 

with his guard after the missed 
free throw.

“I told him, ‘We’re going right 

back at you. You’re going to gets 
3s to help us win the game,’ 
exactly what I said.” Beilein 
said. “He was one of the guys 
we looked in the eyes and said, 
‘You’re gonna bounce back and 
help us win this game.’ ”

The confidence from his coach 

and teammates paid off. On his first 
touch in overtime, Robinson nailed 
a 3-pointer to give Michigan some 
much-needed momentum.

Later in the half, after two 

Northwestern free throws pushed 
its lead to three, Michigan took 
a 30-second timeout and drew 
up another play for Robinson. 
On the ensuing trip down the 
court, the Wolverines executed. 
Robinson came off of a screen from 
sophomore forward Ricky Doyle, 
caught a pass from junior guard 
Zak Irvin and fired.

“I couldn’t see the rim because 

Olah was on it — he was so large, he 
looked nine feet tall to me when he 
came out,” Beilein said. “Duncan 
put a little extra arch on it, and all 
I could see was the net swishing at 
the very end.”

When Michigan needed him 

most, Robinson came through. 
Asked after the game if it was 
the biggest shot of his career, the 
former DIII player hesitated for a 
minute.

“Can’t think of anything else,” 

Robinson said. “So yeah, I guess 
you could say that for now.”

Isaac hopes to make up for lost time

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

On his bedroom door, Ty Isaac 

keeps a list of goals for himself 
as his redshirt junior season 
on the Michigan football team 
nears. Every day as the running 
back leaves for class, he looks 
at everything — personally, 
physically, football-related — he 
needs to improve this season. 
Or, put another way, to avoid 
where he ended up last season.

The 
Southern 
California 

transfer 
began 
last 
season 

as arguably the most highly 
touted player in the Wolverines’ 
backfield. He came in prepared 
to revive Michigan’s struggling 
ground 
game. 
Instead, 
he 

finished fifth on the team in 
carries in 2015, behind three 
other running backs, fifth-year 
senior quarterback Jake Rudock 
and even senior fullback Sione 
Houma. Rising senior running 

back De’Veon Smith ended the 
season with 180 carries, six 
times Isaac’s total.

“I obviously got humbled a 

little bit last season, but you 
still gotta work the same, just 
as hard,” Isaac said Tuesday. 
“It’s De’Veon’s job to lose, which 
gives you a little bit of extra 
motivation, but my mindset 
hasn’t changed. I’m still going 
out every day trying to compete 
to get that starting spot and be 
ready to carry the load when the 
season comes.”

At his lowest point, Isaac 

was left off the depth chart for 
two consecutive games last 
November. Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh called the issue an 
“internal matter,” adding that it 
was “none of your business.”

Isaac said that at one point 

last season, the disappointment 
got to him, and while he 
declined to say exactly when, 
he acknowledged that it was 

around the time of the depth 
chart snub.

Then, he turned to people 

close to him in his life who 
would tell him what he needed 
to do to turn it around. He found 
his way back onto the depth 
chart later that month, and after 
the season, he met with running 
backs coach Tyrone Wheatley to 
iron out more of the issues.

“Just being more intense, 

more 
focused,” 
Isaac 
said. 

“Paying attention to the little 
details — stuff that I knew I 
needed to work on, but we kind 
of went over it together just to 
be clear about everything that I 
needed to do for myself.”

Isaac came back, dropped 

some weight and turned up 
his 
intensity 
in 
practice. 

He’s further down the depth 
chart than where he started 
last season, but to him, that 
only means he’ll have to work 
harder to make up the deficit. 

Stribling readies 
for senior season

By MAX BULTMAN

Managing Sports Editor

Channing Stribling was as 

surprised as anyone on Monday 
when 
Michigan 
defensive 

coordinator Don Brown fired off 
his first tweet since Oct. 2015. It 
was a picture of Stribling with 
a graphic reading “Michigan 
football Dude of the Day.”

Stribling was initially unsure 

whether it was the work of 
an online photo editor or his 
coaches, but when he realized 
Brown had sent the tweet, it 
started to make sense. The 
senior cornerback had three 
interceptions in practice last 
Friday, a performance Brown 
apparently deemed worthy of 
receiving the first award.

“I saw it on Twitter and I was 

like, ‘What is this?’ ” Stribling said 
Thursday. “I didn’t know nothing 
about the Dude of the Day.”

In fact, the coaches hadn’t 

even communicated anything 
about the honor to the players. At 
first, Stribling thought the award 
might be given once a week, but 
then Ben Gedeon earned the 
honor after Tuesday’s practice, 
a sign that there could be many 
Dudes to come.

With 
his 
title 
standing 

currently as a Dude, the senior 
cornerback was understandably 
excited to be recognized. But 
his Dude-dom didn’t come out of 
nowhere.

Ahead of his fourth season 

as a Wolverine, the cornerback 
has spent the offseason striving 
to improve his consistency and 
is battling for a starting spot 
opposite All-American senior 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis.

“I 
know 
that’s 
been 
my 

problem for the last three years,” 
Stribling said. “I mean, people 
say it, but I mean, I guess it’s 
true. So consistency is the main 
thing I’ve gotta try to step up on.”

In three seasons at Michigan, 

Stribling has appeared in 34 
games, starting four times at 
cornerback. He intercepted two 
passes last year while battling a 
hamstring injury for part of the 
season and splitting time with 
Jeremy Clark.

Now, going into the 2016 

campaign, he appears poised to 
compete for a full-time job as a 
starter. But in battling for that 
spot, he’ll have to beat out Clark, 
a fifth-year senior and Stribling’s 
friend.

“That’s my boy,” Stribling 

said of Clark. “We try to push 
each other every day. (Former 
defensive 
coordinator 
D.J.) 

Durkin always told us, in order to 
play in the league, you’ve gotta be 
able to take a grown man’s job. So 
we tell each other that every day, 
like, ‘You’ve gotta take my job,’ 
or, ‘I’ve gotta take yours.’ That’s 
only going to make us better.”

As a senior, though, Stribling 

knows 
that 
his 
on-field 

production 
is 
now 
more 

important than ever. In his final 
season at Michigan, and his 
last year to try to impress NFL 
scouts, he’ll need to earn, and 
then maximize, his playing time.

And in talking to Lewis, who 

could have declared for the 
NFL Draft after last season but 
instead elected to return for his 
senior year, Stribling said the 
All-American had simple advice 
for him.

“Just 
play 
your 
game,” 

Stribling said Lewis has told 
him. “You’ve been doing this for 
four years. I know you’ve had 
some bad plays or whatever, but 
we know you. Everybody else 
doesn’t see you as Strib, but we 
see you as Strib.”

If he wins the job opposite 

Lewis, perhaps everybody else 
will get to see the “Strib” Lewis 
referenced this fall. But until 
then, Dude will have to do.

FOOTBALL
Michigan preps for final home series

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

When the No. 9 Michigan 

hockey team hosts No. 14 Penn 
State this weekend, it will the be 
the last tune-
up 
before 

the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament, 
the last home 
stand for a small 
core of seniors 
and, 
quite 

possibly, the last 
time Wolverines 
coach 
Red 

Berenson 
will 

ever 
stand 

behind 
the 

bench 
for 
a 

game at Yost Ice 
Arena.

The 
long-

tenured coach is in the final year 
of his contract and is undecided on 
his plans for next season.

“I don’t know if this will be 

my last weekend at Yost or not, so 
I’m not going to worry about it,” 
Berenson said. “My last game in 
the NHL, I couldn’t have told you, I 
don’t even remember when it was. 
It didn’t matter.

“I just want us to have a good 

weekend at Yost.”

The series features two of the 

top three teams in the Big Ten, 
and two of the highest-scoring 
offenses in the country. In a 
previous matchup this season, 
which took place at Penn State’s 
Pegula Ice Arena and at Madison 
Square Garden, Michigan (10-5-3 
Big Ten, 20-7-5 overall) outscored 
Penn State, 13-7. Both games were 
closely contested, but the two-win 
weekend jumpstarted the hottest 
stretch of the Wolverines’ season.

When the puck drops Friday 

night, each team will be in a very 
different place than it was a two 
months ago. The Nittany Lions 
(10-7-1, 20-10-4) have faltered after 
a hot start and has not swept a Big 
Ten series since mid-January.

Michigan tore through the 

middle of the regular season 

before dropping three of its last 
four contests against Minnesota 
and Ohio State, respectively.

For 
the 
Wolverines, 
the 

timing 
seems 
abysmal. 
They 

all but cemented an at-large 
bid for the NCAA Tournament 
two weeks ago, but the sense of 
excitement surrounding the team 
has collapsed into something 
resembling trepidation as the 
losses mount.

It’s not that the offensive 

production has slowed down — 
Michigan has 17 goals in the last 
four games — but a combination 
of poor timing and defensive 
meltdowns have hobbled the team.

Penn State is led by senior 

David Goodwin with 33 points. 
Also creating a strong impact is 
freshman Chase Berger, who has 
netted 13 goals on the season. 
The 
Nittany 
Lions 
generally 

rotate 
netminders 
throughout 

the weekend, though freshman 
Eamon McAdam has a far superior 
save percentage at .924.

On the other side of the ice, 

three Wolverines’ — forwards 
Justin Selman and Boo Nieves, 
and goaltender Steve Racine — will 

play at home for the last time in 
their careers.

Selman 
and 
Nieves 
took 

somewhat divergent paths in their 
hockey career when they arrived 
at Michigan, but both have grown 
into major roles on the team, 
becoming close friends in the 
process.

Selman struggled in his first 

two seasons before recommitting 
himself and becoming a jack of all 
trades for the Wolverines.

“I don’t know if it’s always been 

the best thing for him, but it’s 
definitely been a good thing for 
the team,” Berenson said. “When 
(freshman 
forward) 
Cooper 

(Marody) was out and we needed 
(Selman) at center, he came out 
in New York and had a dynamite 
game.”

Nieves is an obvious natural 

talent with tremendous speed at 
6-foot-3. He had a phenomenal 
freshman season, but struggled 
to elevate his game in the two 
following years.

“He got off to a good start, and 

then he’s been pretty good and 
very good at times,” Berenson said. 
“I think this is his best, consistent 

season.”

Racine, one of the Wolverines’ 

most discussed players of late, 
has caught the brunt of the blame 
for struggling defensive units, 
while his own play has fluctuated 
between 
phenomenal 
and 

somewhat disappointing.

“Racine’s always been a goalie 

that can win a game, but he’s also 
a goalie that might lose his focus 
or not be as ready,” Berenson said. 
“But I think he’s matured to the 
point where he can play back to 
back games and play well.”

Berenson’s 
quite 
adept 
at 

capturing the heart and soul of his 
players when he talks about their 
time about Michigan, but he’s not 
ready just yet to contemplate what 
it might mean to coach his final 
weekend behind the bench at Yost.

Thursday, 
he 
immediately 

dismissed the thought that Senior 
Day affects the way the team 
approaches the game.

“If our team lays an egg, then 

the seniors are going to feel terrible 
no matter what,” Berenson said. “If 
we win, they’re going to feel good.”

It’s not hard to imagine that 

Berenson feels the exact same way.

Michigan coach Red Berenson does not yet know whether Saturday will be his last game coaching at Yost Ice Arena.

Romero, ‘M’ look 
to maintain pace

By AVI SHOLKOFF 

Daily Sports Writer

Sierra Romero is no stranger 

to receiving accolades. Since her 
freshman year, the senior infielder 
has racked up award after award, 
and this year is no different.

Romero recently garnered the 

Big Ten Player of the Week and 
two prominent national awards 
from the National Softball Coaches 
Association and USA Softball.

Romero earned those honors 

after going on a tear last week, 
hitting .500 with two home runs 
and 13 RBI. Adding to her résumé, 
she is currently in the midst of a 12 
game hitting streak — the highest 
of her collegiate career. But 
despite her many awards, Romero 
continues to push herself.

“She’s the most locked in 

player that I have,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “She’s 
never satisfied. She hits .500 and 
says, ‘I should’ve hit .600.’ That’s 
why she’s the best player in the 
country.”

Romero and the second-ranked 

Wolverines will look to maintain 
their highly powered offense 
in their final non-conference 
tournament: 
the 
Louisville 

Softball Classic this upcoming 
weekend.

While Michigan’s offense is 

scoring 8.95 runs per game — 
fourth best in the NCAA — its 
pitchers need to improve their 
control before Big Ten play begins.

Working behind such prolific 

hitting definitely aids junior right-
hander Megan Betsa and her 
fellow pitchers in times of trouble. 
Against UCLA last Wednesday, 
for example, the offense came 
through 
after 
some 
erratic 

pitching by Betsa. In just two 
innings of work, she walked four 
and struck out only one batter and 
allowed the Bruins to tie the game.

“A lot of (the walks) are on me, 

that’s my biggest part,” Betsa said. 
“(To) get ahead of the hitters, spin 
the ball to the zone and stay within 
in myself.”

While she continues to rack 

up strikeouts, Betsa looks to 

develop better control in games, 
something difficult to simulate in 
a workout atmosphere. In practice 
this week, Betsa and the other 
members of the staff participated 
in drills designed on pitching in 
the strike zone.

“We have these strings that we 

set up for our workouts, and they 
can work for any different pitch,” 
Betsa said. “But (Wednesday), 
we just set up the strike zone. My 
objective was to start the ball in 
the zone, and it had to break out 
of the (zone) by the time (pitching 
coach Jennifer Brundage) caught 
us to make sure my ball was 
moving enough.”

At Louisville, Michigan will 

once again play Illinois State, who 
it defeated 12-0 in five innings on 
Feb. 12.

Additionally, the Wolverines 

will face off against the Cardinals, 
who are led both on the mound 
and at bat by freshman Megan 
Hensley, who leads the team in 
both home runs and earned run 
average.

Michigan’s 
other 
two 

opponents include a struggling 
Dayton team and an Eastern 
Kentucky 
team 
that 
has 
a 

dynamic duo of pitchers in nine-
game winner Hayley Flynn and 
Alex Salberg, who has a 1.62 
earned run average.

As Betsa mentioned, Hutchins 

believes 
that 
Michigan 
must 

better its accuracy on the mound.

“I’d like Betsa to throw it 

through the zone, for (sophomore 
right-hander) Tera Blanco to hit 
the black of the plate,” Hutchins 
said. Let’s hope guys can get ahead, 
they can have their way with the 
hitters, but we’re throwing around 
with way too many hitters.”

With 
stellar 
offensive 

performances from every spot 
in the lineup, highlighted by 
continued greatness from Romero, 
the Wolverines’ hitting attack will 
look to maintain its torrid pace.

Michigan’s pitching, however, 

must put extra emphasis this 
weekend on throwing strikes and 
not giving up too many free runs.

SOFTBALL

He believes in his own skill 
set, and if one thing is certain 
on Harbaugh’s team, it’s that 
everyone will have a chance to 
compete.

Isaac admits, though, that it 

won’t be easy.

“De’Veon’s been doing really 

well, so it’ll be tough, but as long 
as you can play within yourself 
and do that on a consistent basis, 
I think you got a shot,” he said.

Wheatley insisted Tuesday 

that Isaac’s decreased workload 
last season wasn’t a result of 
anything the running back did 
wrong. He worked hard; Smith 
and others worked harder.

And for a player who was 

in serious contention for the 
starting job at the beginning of 
the season, that wasn’t easy to 
handle.

“It’s something in life you 

have to deal with,” Isaac said. 
“You just kind of sit back and say, 
‘OK, this isn’t where I thought I 
was going to be, but how can I 
start moving forward? What do 
I need to do?’ ”

For Isaac, the answer to that 

came in the form of his list. 
Isaac had one of the Wolverines’ 
early highlights last season 
with a 76-yard touchdown run 
against UNLV, but he almost 
disappeared after that. After 
fumbling twice at Maryland on 
Oct. 3, he carried the ball just 
four times in the following two 
weeks and not again for the rest 
of the season.

The list of goals is his way 

of putting those struggles in 
the past. Smith, redshirt junior 
Drake Johnson and even others 
may be ahead of Isaac in the 
competition this season, but 
Isaac is ready to give them his 
best shot.

“I wouldn’t say reset, but I 

had to gather myself,” Isaac said. 
“It’s one of those things where 
it’s never as good as you think 
it is, and it’s never as bad as you 
think it is. I just had to calm 
down, relax and understand 
that there were things I needed 
to work on.

“It’s not like it was going to 

be the end of the world for me. I 
still have opportunities.”
