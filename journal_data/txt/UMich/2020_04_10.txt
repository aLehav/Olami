On March 23, University President 

Mark Schlissel notified the University 

of Michigan community that spring 

and summer terms classes would 

be conducted remotely. Despite the 

move to continue online instruction, 

tuition for the spring/summer terms 

will remain the same, University 

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald told The 

Daily. 

“There will be no changes in tuition 

and fees for the spring/summer 

terms,” Fitzgerald wrote in an email. 

“Spring/summer tuition is based on 

the number of credit hours a student 

is taking.”

While students’ summer plans 

continue to change amid various 

internship and job cancellations, 

students said these cancellations 

and the move to remote learning 

are making them consider spring or 

summer term classes. This is the case 

for LSA sophomore Nathan Martin, 

who will be taking summer courses in 

lieu of working with one of the many 

canceled internship programs he 

applied to.

“I definitely wouldn’t have taken 

Michigan spring/summer courses, 

but I’m planning on taking summer 

courses simply because I don’t see 

myself as being able to do much else 

with my summer,” Martin said. “I’m 

on the lookout for remote internship 

gigs, but those are pretty hard to come 

by I feel.”

The cost per credit hour in spring 

and summer terms is the same as fall 

and winter. Students typically take 

less credits in spring and summer than 

in fall and winter.

In an interview with The Daily 

March 27, Schlissel said not every 

course originally expected to be taught 

for spring and summer semesters may 

not be because the ones that will will 

be taught well with more preparation 

for the remote teaching format.

“We probably won’t be teaching 

every single course we planned to 

teach, but the ones we teach are going 

to be at a University of Michigan level 

quality, we’ll have time to prepare,” 

Schlissel said. “The students will get 

the same kind of full credit they’d be 

getting if they were taking the course 

entirely in person. It’ll just be delivered 

remotely, but the usual tuition will 

apply.”

After 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan chose to extend the add/

drop deadline for classes until 

April 21, financial aid recipients 

— both on merit or need-based aid 

— received a mass email from the 

University on March 24 reminding 

students to seek out resources 

from the Office of Financial Aid if 

needed.

While 
extending 
the 
drop 

deadline was meant to provide 

academic 
flexibility, 
according 

to Kedra Ishop, vice provost 

for 
enrollment 
management, 

students receiving University aid 

were warned about the potential 

consequences of dropping below 

the 12-credit-hour requirement 

for full-time student status. 

Despite different financial aid 

packages varying in eligibility 

requirements, 
including 
credit 

hours, the last part of the email 

noted that the amount of aid a 

student receives can be impacted 

by a change in full-time status.

Though the email said aid “can 

be impacted,” the message created 

confusion among aid recipients 

who interpreted the message as 

stating students with any form of 

need or merit-based aid will risk 

losing their financial package if 

they choose to drop below full 

time.

Public 
Policy 
junior 
Molly 

Macleod, 
recipient 
of 
the 

University of Michigan Grant, 

was initially misled by the email. 

After moving off campus, Macleod 

dropped a minicourse and lost 

her on-campus job, but remained 

a 
full-time 
student. 
While 

Macleod’s specific grant does not 

require full-time status during 

a typical school year, Macleod 

assumed this message applied to 

her. 

“I read the email and I thought 

that I have to remain full time, 

otherwise I won’t get my financial 

aid,” Macleod said.

In an email to The Daily, 

Tammie Durham, assistant vice 

provost and executive director of 

financial aid, said financial aid 

will not be impacted for students 

who drop below full time.

“During 
this 
winter 
term, 

students 
who 
are 
unable 
to 

complete a full-time course load 

because of Covid 19 who started 

the class prior to the pandemic 

will not experience adjustments 

in their aid,” Durham wrote. “All 

students interested in federal 

financial aid will be considered 

as long as they are enrolled in a 

minimum of six credits during any 

given term. This is not a change in 

policy.” 

According to the Office of 

Registrar website last updated on 

March 27, undergraduates who 

withdraw from a course after 

March 10 through the last day of 

classes will not receive a “W” on 

their official transcript indicating 

dropping the class; however, a 

“W” will appear on the student’s 

unofficial transcript.

ANN ARBOR

The city of Ann Arbor 

launched a billion-dollar plan 

March 30 to make the city 

carbon neutral by 2030. 

The plan, named A2Zero, 

includes 
more 
than 
50 

points aimed at slashing the 

community’s 2.1 million metric 

tons of carbon emissions to 

zero in 10 years. This would 

ideally be accomplished by 

powering the electrical grid 

with 100 percent renewable 

energy, switching appliances 

and vehicles to natural gas and 

A2Zero forges ahead on 
environmental initiatives

2 — Friday, April 10, 2020
News
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

In a webinar delivered to more 

than 2,000 University of Michigan 

alumni and business professionals, 

Lindy Greer, associate professor 

and faculty director of the Sanger 

Leadership 
Center, 
explained 

how remote working can change 

a workspace for the better by 

allowing 
for 
productive 
team 

communication 

and organized 

leadership. 

In 
her 

discussion, 

Greer 

acknowledged 

the 
downfalls 

of 
remote 

work 
before 

diving into the 

benefits. 
She 

discussed 
the 

struggle of not 

being able to 

sync up with 

a work team as well as the lack of 

excitement in video chats. Greer 

sympathized with workers around 

the nation who are working from 

home 
throughout 
the 
current 

COVID-19 pandemic.

“I’m super excited again to talk 

about why remote work sucks and 

is kind of awful at times as many of 

us have realized,” Greer said. “But 

at the same time, then how do we 

take these challenges to get really 

intentional about the peoples’ side 

of work?”

Greer responded to questions 

from 
employees 
of 
companies 

throughout the country who were 

viewing 
the 
seminar. 
Melanie 

Weaver Barnett, chief executive 

education officer at the Business 

School, spoke on behalf of remote 

viewers, taking questions and ideas 

from the webinar’s chat.

Barnett asked if there is a 

specific personality and aptitude 

needed to be successful in remote 

management. 

“For me, if I’m doing remote 

work, what are the three things 

to look for,” Greer said. “(For 

me, it) would be productivity 

or independence, comfort with 

technology and social support.”

Greer transitioned to discuss 

the positives involved in remote 

working, 
noting 
that 
many 

successful remote teams work to 

build a family culture. She said 

by keeping a company’s values in 

mind, such as customer service 

or trust, leaders can create a 

community for their workers. With 

a feeling of belonging, Greer said 

employees become more engaged 

and more willing to handle the 

issues at hand. 

“One of the unique things that 

they mentioned that I thought that 

was very interesting about what 

makes them work well remotely is 

culture and having a really strong 

culture where they really promote 

this idea of family,” Greer said. 

“They put a lot of effort there to 

build a family-like culture where 

they check in with people a lot.”

Barnett 
engaged 
in 
the 

discussion, 
exploring 
what 

methods and technologies have 

worked best for her own work.

“We’ve been starting out our 

meetings by saying we’re going 

to do a quick check-in with your 

teammate. 
And 
immediately 

everybody’s paired up with one 

other person, you don’t know who 

you’re going to get paired up with,” 

Barnett said. “You do a quick check-

in: What’s working for you/What 

are you struggling with? Is there 

anything you need? And people 

have expressed really benefiting 

from that.”

Business 

freshman Noah 

Cox 
said 
he 

was interested 

in 
how 

businesses 
are 

transforming 

their 

communication 

while 
working 

remotely.

“Business 

is 
all 

about 
communication, 
but 

communication is only 7 percent 

the words you say,” Cox said. 

“So even work that can be done 

remotely is hugely impacted in this 

environment, but businesses have 

to learn to adapt like using video 

conferencing as much as possible.”

Greer ended the webinar with 

a few key takeaways. She offered 

advice on how to manage a remote 

team in an organized, intentional 

manner.

“Scaffold together your team to 

be intentional about the core things 

that teams need to do well,” Greer 

said. “This includes the culture, 

the objectives, the processes and 

the ability to experiment, and write 

and use those playbooks to run 

your virtual meetings.”

electric, and improving energy 

efficiency in homes, businesses, 

schools, places of worship, recreational 

sites and government facilities.

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 

Taylor said the plan will be disruptive, 

but will create a community that 

better incorporates its values of 

sustainability and equity. 

“Ann 
Arbor 
2030 
will 
be 

materially different than Ann Arbor 

2020,” Taylor said. “It’ll be a denser 

community, 
a 
more 
electrified 

community, 
a 
community 
that 

emphasizes renewable energy.”

The plan will dedicate $900 million 

to reduce miles traveled in vehicles 

by at least 50 percent, which will 

eliminate 8 percent of community-

wide emissions. 

Missy 
Stults, 
Ann 
Arbor’s 

sustainability 
and 
innovations 

manager, said some of the costs can be 

offset by outside sources of funding, 

but A2Zero’s billion-dollar price tag is 

necessary. 

“It is expensive, but inaction is 

far more expensive, as we’re coming 

to find out,” Stults said. “Whether 

or not we do this, the climate is still 

changing. This is just an imperative 

to help mitigate the impacts of what’s 

coming.” 

Though 
City 
Council 
passed 

Resolution 19-2103: “A Resolution in 

Support of Creating a Plan to Achieve 

Ann Arbor Community-Wide Climate 

Neutrality by 2030” long before 

COVID-19’s 
disruption, 
leaders 

designed A2Zero as a “living plan” 

prepared to adjust to obstacles. 

Taylor said the COVID-19 crisis 

will hurt and hinder the community’s 

ability to achieve carbon neutrality, 

but the scope of the crisis can be 

viewed as an opportunity. 

“All lines of work, all manners 

of 
doing 
things, 
are 
open 
to 

interrogation,” Taylor said. “The old 

way of running an economy, the old 

way of doing business, the old way 

of operating civil society is subject 

to change, subject to reexamination, 

subject to improvement. As we figure 

out where we go next, reconstituting 

as a functioning society with the goal 

of carbon neutrality will be a part of 

our recovery.” 

Stults said the current COVID-19 

pandemic is an opportunity to double 

down on the plan’s resilience efforts 

intended to strengthen community 

responses to a changing climate. 

She said while most of our lives have 

paused because of the pandemic, 

natural and manmade disasters will 

continue.

“From a resilience standpoint, I’m 

terrified thinking about what’s going 

to happen during a pandemic when 

we’re socially isolated and the storm 

takes power out,” Stults said. “What 

do we do then? What does it look 

like when our food supply chain gets 

disrupted? The pandemic isn’t related 

to climate change, but the pandemic is 

laying bare the vulnerabilities that we 

have regardless.”

Stults said the community needs to 

accept a degree of failure as part of the 

process to achieve the ultimate goal of 

carbon neutrality. 

“This idea of being okay with failure, 

or failure positive as we call it, is a total 

paradigm shift in most situations, but 

so is climate change,” Stults said. “So, 

we have to be comfortable with trying 

something and being okay coming 

back and saying, ‘You know, that was 

not as successful as we thought it was 

going to be.’ The ultimate objective is 

a safe climate, it’s a high quality of life. 

Basically, a bunch of things can fail for 

different reasons, and we have to be 

okay with that.”

Rackham 
student 
Matthew 

Sehrsweeney, 
an 
organizer 
in 

Michigan’s Climate Action Movement, 

said 
environmental 
activists 
on 

campus have been grappling with 

how to continue their work amid 

social distancing measures. He said 

activists have worked to understand 

how to maintain low-carbon lifestyles 

after social distancing measures 

are lifted, demonstrate solidarity 

with movements fighting for racial, 

economic and carceral justice and 

highlight 
the 
danger 
posed 
by 

environmental injustices such as poor 

air quality.

Sehrsweeney pointed to ways the 

University could reduce its carbon 

emissions.

“Universities are always flying 

people in and hosting big conferences 

where people are flying across the 

country,” said Sehrsweeney. “Now 

we’re demonstrating all these online 

tools that we can use to bring people 

in virtually and you don’t have to be 

flying them across the country.”

Sehrsweeney 
said 
there 
are 

significant 
barriers 
to 
achieving 

carbon neutrality, pointing to state 

laws and COVID-19, but that the 

community’s plan is essential. 

“It’s 
absolutely 
necessary,” 

Sehrsweeney said. “Especially for a 

city like Ann Arbor that has pretty 

concentrated wealth. If Ann Arbor 

can’t do it, then how are any poor 

cities going to do it?”

Taylor said the community will 

accomplish carbon neutrality by 

2030. 

“The bottom line is, we have a 

carbon neutrality goal,” Taylor 

said. “That is a commitment from 

the city government, and we’re 

going to do everything we can to 

achieve that goal.”

Durham said the University 

sent the mass email cautioning 

students receiving financial aid 

about the risk of dropping below 

full time prior to President 

Trump signing the Coronavirus 

Aid, 
Relief 
and 
Economic 

Security (CARES) Act into law 

on March 27. The act outlines a 

monetary relief package which 

in part provides the University 

with funds to support students 

reliant on financial aid. 

“We did intentionally send 

that email to help students plan 

in case federal relief was not 

made available to colleges and 

universities,” 
Durham 
said. 

“Thankfully, since that email, 

the CARES Act has provided 

flexibility for those students 

impacted by Covid 19.” 

During any particular school 

year, students receiving need 

and merit based scholarships 

are required to meet federal as 

well as University set guidelines 

specific to their scholarship, 

known as Satisfactory Academic 

Requirements. These guidelines 

can include volunteer hours, 

academic grade point average 

and minimum credit hours. 

The CARES Act now ensures 

that throughout the COVID-19 

pandemic, students receiving 

financial 
aid 
will 
not 
be 

penalized for not fulfilling these 

requirements. 

In Section 3509, the act states 

that in determining whether a 

student maintains satisfactory 

academic 
progress, 
“an 

institution of higher education 

may, as a result of a qualifying 

emergency, exclude from the 

quantitative 
component 
of 

the calculation any attempted 

credits that were not completed 

by 
such 
student 
without 

requiring an appeal by such 

student.”

Angela 
Morabito, 
U.S. 

Department 
of 
Education 

press secretary, reiterated the 

purpose of this act in an email to 

The Daily.

“We know that this national 

public health emergency has 

created challenges for students 

and we are continually working 

to 
provide 
institutions 
and 

students with the flexibility they 

need as they make the transition 

to distance education,” Morabito 

wrote.

Students who assumed they 

could not drop below full-time 

credit status due to the initial 

email sent on March 24 can still 

withdraw from a class due to 

the University-wide add/drop 

policy extension. 

Macleod said the University’s 

lack 
of 
clarity 
regarding 

required credit hours is placing 

a further burden on students 

with financial aid. 

“I 
think 
it’s 
incredibly 

misleading,” 
Macleod 
said. 

“I think they are concealing 

some opportunities for people, 

that they don’t have to stay full 

time necessarily to keep their 

scholarships. But by sending a 

mass email to everyone saying 

that you have to stay full time, 

that just kind of closes some 

doors for people.” 

LSA junior Amytess Girgis 

is 
another 
student 
who 

misinterpreted the email by the 

University. Girgis is a recipient 

of the Penelope W. and E. Roe 

Stamps Scholarship merit-based 

scholarship. 
Under 
federal 

guidelines 
during 
a 
typical 

school year, students receiving 

this scholarship are required to 

maintain full-time status.

Girgis felt this message was 

particularly damaging due to 

the uncertainty many students 

with financial aid feel due to 

job losses, moving and a quick 

transition to online classes.

“The impression to me was just 

that a lot of students, including 

myself, who are thrown into this 

confusing COVID situation, who 

are suddenly spending a lot more 

time than they normally would 

taking care of family members, 

taking 
care 
of 
themselves, 

moving, working, are scared 

because they read this email and 

think that there is absolutely no 

way they can cut back on their 

course load,” Girgis said. 

Girgis 
attributed 
the 

misunderstanding 
to 
poor 

communication 
by 
the 

University. 

“This is a communications 

issue,” Girgis said. “I wish that 

the University had been smarter 

about how they relate these 

messages and had done it with 

a bit more caution in how they 

word their emails.”

Martin said he should not have 

to pay full tuition with the loss of 

on-campus resources and facilities.

“I’m not able to utilize things like 

the buildings for my classes,” Martin 

said. “I’m not sure exactly how much 

building maintenance and upkeep 

costs each student, but whatever 

it is I’d like to keep my portion of 

that since I literally cannot use the 

buildings… Obviously the (University) 

could not have foreseen this and they 

can’t just not clean buildings, but they 

can reduce the services they apply to 

buildings.”

For Martin, tuition is not just 

about credits, but the opportunities 

available on campus. 

“I’m not just paying for the 

credits,” Martin said. “I’m paying 

for the ability to network with 

other 
students, 
have 
research 

opportunities, engage in the student 

clubs and experience college life in 

Ann Arbor. The actual exchange of 

goods from the University to me is, 

yes, a degree, but that’s not the only 

reason I and many others attend 

college. Some things simply can’t be 

replaced online.”

Though Martin is in favor of tuition 

reduction, he recognizes that faculty 

and staff must be paid to continue 

teaching classes and provide some 

services remotely. Martin said this 

only further complicates the issue of 

tuition costs and financial resources 

available to the University. 

A FAQ page from the Office of 

the Registrar addresses winter term 

tuition and fees and this approach 

also will apply to spring/summer 

term as well, according to Fitzgerald. 

The page explains that tuition will 

continue to pay faculty and staff as 

well as additional expenses.

“Tuition and fees will continue 

to pay for our faculty teaching 

courses as well as all the associated 

costs of delivering our educational 

experience in this COVID-related 

remote 
environment,” 
the 
page 

reads. “Instructors will be available 

and delivering content, albeit in an 

alternative format, and students 

will be completing their classes, 

receiving credit and grades, and 

continuing to work toward their 

degree requirements at a world-class 

institution.”

Unlike 
Martin, 
Engineering 

freshman Kashaf Usman said she has 

canceled her previous plans to take 

summer courses. With a difficult 

transition to remote learning, Usman 

said in an email to The Daily that 

being charged full tuition for online 

classes was not ideal for her.

“I had planned on taking a few 

courses before everything started 

bandwagoning, but staying home 

and taking classes via Zoom has 

hindered 
my 
learning 
greatly,” 

Usman wrote. “I have always had 

trouble focusing in general, and this 

situation isn’t helping. Since this was 

my first semester at Michigan and 

I experienced this semester with 

such hardship, I decided not to take 

courses over the summer.”

Usman also noted the types of 

classes taken online might affect how 

they occur online.

“Many people don’t have the 

option to take summer off and paying 

full tuition for online classes is a little 

absurd,” Usman wrote. “People who 

have interactive labs are at a greater 

disadvantage than students like me 

that are mostly taking EECS courses, 

which are I guess doable online.”

Biology lecturer Cindee Giffen 

teaches Biology 173 lab over the 

spring/summer term and said though 

students may feel they are getting less 

out of interactive labs, courses like 

these are needed in order for students 

to graduate on time.

“Nobody that’s teaching in spring 

and summer is doing it because we 

get a lot of money or because we’re 

enjoying this,” Giffen said. “The 

reason why I’m doing it in spring and 

summer is because I teach a course 

that’s a prerequisite for a lot of other 

courses and if we didn’t offer it this 

spring then a lot of students would 

be behind in their education. From 

a lecturer’s perspective, we’re just 

trying to offer the courses so that 

students can progress in their degree 

requirements. Our concern primarily 

is to make sure that students can 

actually finish.”

She said if tuition were to be 

lowered, as a lecturer she would make 

even less money during the spring/

summer term.

“For lecturers, the vast majority 

of our appointments are dedicated to 

teaching,” Giffen said. “The people 

that are doing a lot of the teaching and 

in spring and summer are lecturers. 

When you look at the faculty salaries 

for people who are teaching in spring 

and summer, we’re not the people 

who make the big money. If I don’t 

teach in spring and summer, I make 

no money — zero dollars — for four 

months. For my spring class that I’m 

teaching, by the time benefits and 

everything are covered, I’ll probably 

make around $7,500 for the whole 

summer.”

Giffen said the faculty and staff 

would be most affected by tuition 

lowering compared to administrators, 

who make significantly more money.

“Not that I would tell students who 

they should be complaining to, but I 

don’t think that it’s the faculty that 

have the really deep pockets here, 

especially given that most of us are 

lecturers and do make less money,” 

Giffen said. “I think the place where 

there is extra money would be among 

our administrators.”

eing able to witness a pandemic 

like COVID-19 in our lifetime 

has been both a dream and a 

nightmare for me. For many public health 

students, a real-life pandemic is everything 

our education has been building toward. 

In every class, we are reminded of our 

predecessors who created the polio vaccine 

and eradicated the source of cholera way 

back when. We are constantly empowered 

to work for communities that are the most 

vulnerable and under-served. We aim to 

uplift the voices of those that may be hidden 

by systematic oppression. Yet when news of 

the virus coming to the state of Michigan 

came, I found that many of us were quiet.

No matter if you’re in public health, 

medicine or any other field, the COVID-

19 pandemic scares every single one of us. 

We’re all human. As public health students, 

we realize the importance of social isolation; 

of flattening the curve; of making sure that 

our health systems and hospitals are not 

given more than they can take. But at the 

same time, the human in me is still stressed, 

confused and helpless. 

Every day, as I slog through hours of 

online classes, I look back at all the times I 

took my life for granted—seeing my friends 

every day, not having to worry whether 

someone in my family has been exposed, 

being able to go about my day as I normally 

would. Not finishing the semester out is one 

thing, but being removed from our lifestyles 

has left many of us in a state of shock. I’ve 

learned that this “disturbance” is the cause 

of my newfound constant exhaustion and 

lack of motivation. 

My heart aches as I see all the stories 

on Twitter or on the news. Every time I 

FaceTime a friend, I’m being told of more 

heart-wrenching narratives. It hurts to see 

photos of vulnerable populations, like the 

elderly and those who cannot afford to buy 

in bulk in grocery stores, looking so helpless 

when they see nothing on the shelves. It 

hurts to see videos of people whose parents, 

aunts, uncles and loved ones are dealing 

with the virus. This pandemic is bigger than 

anyone ever imagined it to be. 

Students are being hurried off of campus, 

even if they don’t have the means to do so, 

as fast as everything is occurring. A huge 

disparity still remains between those who 

are actually being tested and those who are 

not. Every day more celebrities announce 

they’ve been tested for the virus, while 

regular people are not. Many still have to 

go to work to pay their bills because they 

cannot afford to give that money up to stay 

home; unpaid leave is not an option. 

COVID-19 has made me realize my 

privilege and I encourage everyone to 

realize theirs too. You don’t have to be a 

public health major to see how important 

it is for us to take care of each other, to keep 

in touch or to reach out to those who may 

be struggling during these times. These are 

times for solidarity. 

This pandemic motivates me to see how 

impactful the public health field can be and 

how it facilitates change so fast. The biggest 

thing about public health is that, if we do our 

work well, you won’t see the effects of the 

issue later. Though COVID-19 has already 

destroyed the lives of many, I am hoping that 

we all can prevent it from getting worse for 

others dealing with it or who are susceptible. 

It’s the least we can do for humanity. It 

is both a dream and a nightmare, but I’m 

hoping that I can wake up soon and it’ll be 

over as fast as it started.

SANIA FAROOQ | OP-ED

Facing COVID-19 as a public health student

Sania Farooq is junior in the School 

of Public Health and can be reached at 

sffarooq@umich.edu.

T

he 
nation’s 
43rd 

president, George W. 

Bush, is a polarizing 

figure. In foreign affairs, the 

most well-known part of his 

legacy is probably his decision 

to 
pursue 
military 
action 

in Iraq and that will, in all 

likelihood, remain the thing 

for which he is known best. 

However, it is important to 

consider that this is only part 

of his legacy in international 

affairs. 

Another part of it is the role 

America played to address the 

AIDS crisis in Africa. Former 

President Bush pushed for the 

establishment of the President’s 

Emergency 
Plan 
For 
AIDS 

Relief (PEPFAR). This is an 

initiative to address the global 

health crises surrounding HIV/

AIDS that has, to this date, 

spent more than $90 billion on 

this crisis since 2004. 

Bush rose to office as a 

different kind of conservative. 

He 
was 
a 
“compassionate 

conservative” — he wanted 

to use the government to 

improve the general welfare 

and PEPFAR was one way in 

which he did that. Bush’s 

interest in Africa came from a 

1990 visit to The Gambia with 

his wife, Laura Bush, and in 

the lead up to his decision to 

enter the race, then-advisor 

(and future Secretary of State) 

Condoleeza Rice pressed Bush 

to make addressing the AIDS 

epidemic in Africa a serious 

part of his foreign policy 

legacy. This 1998 conversation 

proved far more prescient than 

either of the participants could 

have imagined.

Bush 
announced 
the 

program in his 2003 State of 

the Union Address, though 

it was overshadowed by the 

fact that this speech also 

featured justifications for the 

invasion of Iraq. The project 

was one owned by Bush — he 

was willing to stick his neck 

out for additional money from 

Congress if he saw results. As 

it happened, the results he saw 

were incredibly encouraging. 

PEPFAR has saved the lives 

of millions and improved the 

lives of millions more and to 

his credit, it has done it in an 

effective, efficient manner — 

it prevented deaths from HIV 

for under $2,500 per death 

prevented. Though it is an 

AIDS program, some studies 

have suggested that it reduced 

the odds of death by 20 percent 

in general in countries where 

it existed. Further, it has 

directly reduced tuberculosis 

infections and deaths.

In today’s discussion around 

COVID-19, much attention is 

paid to how former President 

Barack Obama handled Ebola. 

I agree that Obama’s work was 

commendable there. However, 

in the global health arena, one 

place Obama left something to 

be desired was with regards to 

PEPFAR. Obama and his team 

created budgets that “slashed 

hundreds of millions of dollars 

from PEPFAR.” Unfortunately, 

President Donald Trump has 

gone further here and has 

released budget proposals with 

“$1.35 billion in cuts to the 

President’s 
Emergency 
Plan 

for AIDS Relief.” Both of these 

presidents have cut and increased 

funding to different programs, 

as has been their prerogative. 

However, this goes to show 

why Bush deserves credit for 

PEPFAR. It was his prerogative 

and should be recognized as 

such, especially in light of its 

exemplary results.

PEPFAR was a way for 

America to lead in the global 

health arena. The AIDS crisis 

ravaged America in the 1980s 

and the initial response by the 

government was a subject of 

criticism then and widespread 

denunciation now. PEPFAR 

was a chance to reverse this 

issue and Bush seized the 

issue to show why America 

deserved to lead the world in 

global and public health and 

how exactly it would go about 

doing so. Because of American 

leadership regarding AIDS, an 

AIDS-free generation is within 

sight and PEPFAR has played 

a large role in getting to this 

point.

However, there must be more. 

Thankfully, cuts to PEPFAR 

were 
rejected 
by 
Congress 

under Obama and Trump and 

in both cases, funding was set at 

levels beyond those requested 

by 
the 
president. 
This 
is 

something but isn’t enough. 

Bush may have been an unlikely 

catalyst for a public health 

revolution but he very clearly 

was one — the results do not 

lie. Today, however, that kind 

of compassionate conservatism 

and 
desire 
for 
American 

leadership doesn’t exist as it 

did under Bush and the nation, 

world and public health are 

all worse for it. PEPFAR is an 

example of America at its best. 

Like other programs, such as 

the Marshall Plan or the Berlin 

Airlift, it is proof that when 

American leadership decides 

to accomplish a goal, that goal 

will be accomplished. Bush 

wanted to make his mark with 

AIDS, and it is hard to argue 

that he didn’t.

BOOKS NOTEBOOK

“OK, Boomer,” I mutter, as I follow Laurence 

Cook, a senile Iowan farmer who foolishly attempts 

to divide his agricultural empire among his three 

daughters, with disastrous consequences. If this 

story sounds familiar, that’s because you’ve likely 

heard it before: It’s the plot of Jane Smiley’s 1991 

novel “A Thousand Acres,” which in turn is an 

adaptation of Shakespeare’s “King Lear.” As far as 

adaptations go, “A Thousand Acres” is surprisingly 

faithful to the source material, yet Smiley manages 

to infuse the novel with her own personality 

and flair, exploring topics such as second-wave 

feminism and ecocriticism. Of course, with 

Shakespeare adaptations, this is not uncommon: 

There have been numerous critically acclaimed 

Shakespeare adaptations set in radically different 

settings, such as the 1957 film “Throne of Blood,” 

which places Macbeth in feudal Japan, or a 2013 

production of “Julius Caesar” set in contemporary 

Africa. And who could ever forget the Disney 

classic “The Lion King”? This list goes on, and is 

only a testament to the transcendent relevance of 

the Bard.

To be fair, theater lends itself well to creative 

liberty: The cast and crew are what imbue a 

play with life, and no one production will look 

the same as the next. Western culture seems 

comfortable with the malleability that theatre 

permits, but this comfort seems to dissipate when 

the same malleability is introduced in book or film 

adaptations. A common complaint of adaptations 

is that they “are nothing like the book,” or didn’t 

“capture the magic of the source material.” I’ve 

made these complaints myself about a multitude 

of adaptations and reboots. A few that come to 

mind are the infamous Percy Jackson films, the 

Broadway musical “Fun Home” and HBO’s “Game 

of Thrones.” However, whatever one’s thoughts 

are on these, these works still possess artistic value 

(OK, maybe that isn’t true for the Percy Jackson 

movies) and perhaps shouldn’t be expected to 

adhere perfectly to the source material. In fact, 

I’d argue that we should push for more liberal 

adaptations, ones that aren’t afraid to be different, 

even if the deviations cause discomfort among fans 

of the original source.

Such deviations exemplify the beauty and value 

art has: Art is living and transcendent yet deeply 

intimate. Jane Smiley shows that relative fidelity 

can be highly effective, and there is nothing wrong 

with adaptations that adhere perfectly to the 

subject of adaptation. But more drastic divergence 

from the original creator’s vision allows the adapter 

to explore different themes and create a distinct 

standalone artwork. Take Stanley Kubrick’s “The 

Shining” as an example. The 1980 masterpiece is 

based on Stephen King’s eponymous novel, and 

has remained a staple in cinema since its release. 

However, King has stated his dislike for the 

movie, and has repeatedly expressed frustration at 

Kubrick’s numerous alterations from the book. And 

King is right about one thing: The movie bears little 

resemblance to the book. But that’s a good thing. 

Whereas King’s novel paints the main character as 

fundamentally good, Kubrick’s film portrays him 

as fundamentally evil, and these two drastically 

different messages stretch the basic narrative far 

beyond what either artist originally intended. The 

supernatural and psychological evils portrayed 

present entirely different layers of fear and tension, 

and both works have their own strengths and goals. 

The novel allowed King to draw upon his struggles 

with alcoholism and writing, and the film allowed 

Kubrick to explore whether madness is inherent or 

created. The horror genre would not be the same 

without either of these masterpieces, and I think 

that illustrates the value in changing a work of art 

to create something new.

“The Shining” isn’t the only film to draw the ire 

of the source material’s creator and the praise of 

everyone else. Peter Jackson’s legendary “The Lord 

of the Rings” film trilogy has undoubtedly shaped 

the West’s relationship with high fantasy since its 

debut in 2001, but Christopher Tolkien, the son of 

author J.R.R. Tolkien, was not as impressed. And, 

controversial opinion, I’m not a fan of the films 

either: I feel that they eviscerate Tolkien’s original 

work, trading depth in exchange for excitement and 

thrill. 

That being said, I still believe that these 

films are irreplaceable, and that, in spite of my 

distaste for how the source material was treated, 

I can appreciate the directions Jackson took the 

film in. Tolkien’s three-volume saga simply is not 

translatable directly into film. In fact, his identity 

as a European white man who was born at the turn 

of the twentieth century further complicates this. 

“The Lord of the Rings” books are predominantly 

descriptive affairs, with indulgent commentaries 

on religion and Germanic history. Further, 

Tolkien’s seminal work is built upon an extensive 

internal history that cannot be explained by a bit 

of mere exposition, and is self-referential to an 

absurd degree. It can be a bit intimidating to jump 

into his universe and be hit with the feeling that 

you skipped a book in the series, and to the general 

moviegoing audience, this would be a huge turn off. 

Peter Jackson managed to condense much 

of this lore into a digestible plot, alluding to bits 

of in-universe history as was necessary, and 

substituted lengthy descriptions with stunning set 

design and scenery. Jackson even manages to make 

the films just a *little* less of a sausage fest than 

what Tolkien’s books were, which helps offset the 

clear male identity Tolkien was writing from. Thus, 

as I gain more perspective, I grow to appreciate the 

beauty in what Jackson made, and have come to 

terms with the fact that, in a few ways, his trilogy 

even improves upon what Tolkien wrote. 

Sometimes, though, adaptations can go a step 

further, and deviate almost completely from the 

source material, even in terms of themes and 

tone. The musical “Fun Home,” based on Alison 

Bechdel’s graphic novel memoir of the same name, 

is a perfect example of this. Both the musical and 

the graphic novel depict the same set of events, 

and the same individual’s life. However, whereas 

Bechdel’s memoir portrays specific episodes in her 

life that she clearly remembers, the musical plays 

around with the structure, drawing from multiple 

scenes to create one scene that is representative of 

many. The text-to-stage translation isn’t “literal,” 

but it uses this to its advantage and explores the 

narrative with a different sort of vibrancy and life 

from what the memoir had. Likewise, the memoir 

captured elements that the musical could not, such 

as the depth and genuineness Bechdel poured into 

her work. 

I listened to the musical before I read Bechdel’s 

memoir, and the difference was clear to me. At 

first, it was difficult for me to reconcile these two 

works with one another, as they were so different in 

tone, and I became unsure of which one I enjoyed 

more, or if they were even comparable in quality. 

Eventually, I came to the conclusion that the 

differences between the two enhanced one another, 

and I stopped measuring them against each other. 

I began to enjoy them as separate entities, and my 

appreciation for both has increased as a result.

Why we need less faithful adaptions of literature

MUSIC REVIEW
On new album, Yves Tumor turns into a rockstar

JIM WILSON
Daily Arts Writer

Some say the place you’re from is what makes 

you who you are. If that truly is the case, then 

Sean Bowie certainly is a complex person. Born in 

Miami and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee, they 

attended college in Southern California and briefly 

resided in Leipzig, Germany. Bowie, better known 

by their recording name Yves Tumor, now lives and 

works in Turin, Italy. If that was too much, here’s 

a streamlined version: first Miami, then Knoxville, 

then Southern California, then Leipzig and now 

Turin. That’s a lot of places, and somehow, not a 

single one sticks out as a prominent influence on 

Tumor’s music. 

Yves Tumor’s brand of rock is unlike that of any 

other artist. They have so many influences it’s hard 

to pinpoint exactly where the Yves Tumor sound 

comes from. However, it has been said that Tumor 

started making music as a way to escape their 

conservative and growth-stunting surroundings 

in Knoxville. Of all the places that have shaped 

Tumor, this is the most important one. Their music 

is an artful, expressive escape from the bland 

and monochrome ordinary, established by 2018’s 

outstanding Safe in the Hands of Love. Their most 

recent album, Heaven to a Tortured Mind, keeps 

that same momentum.

Heaven to a Tortured Mind is a bit of a throwback 

album, calling back to the massive sounds of ’90s 

behemoths like Smashing Pumpkins and Pearl 

Jam, but the record is like the weird kid brother 

to that style. The album’s foundations are laid in 

huge choruses and soaring riffs. Tumor is never 

afraid of exploring other genres, but this project 

always seems to return to its rock roots. Somehow, 

all this mixing and matching works, and it works 

really well. Thanks to Tumor’s fearless exploration, 

Heaven to a Tortured Mind is 

as sticky and enjoyable as an 

album can get.

Take “Medicine Burn” 

as an example of this 

fearlessness. Outwardly, it 

sounds like a standard rock 

song, but there’s a whole 

lot more going on beneath 

the hood. The cacophonous 

guitars live on the verge 

of noise, and around the 

middle of the song they 

suddenly 
and 
abrasively 

break the noise barrier, 

erupting 
into 
nothing 

short of pure madness. Surprisingly, the track 

eventually fades into nothing more than a handful 

of futuristic blips and bleps, with no trace of the 

earlier instrumentation to be found. But somehow 

this combination works, resulting in one of the 

most infectious songs on the album, all thanks to 

Tumor’s ability to wrangle any sound exactly the 

way they want to. Their lyrics perfectly accentuate 

the noise, with lines like “He’s got scarlet colored 

teeth, she had severed heads / And six hundred 

teeth, and six hundred / And six hundred, and six 

hundred,” making the song even stickier than it 

already was. 

Some of the tracks, like “Gospel for a New 

Century” and “Kerosene!,” lean more heavily 

toward the rock end of the 

spectrum, and they’re all the 

better for it. These rock songs 

are something of a cheat 

code for Tumor. They pull 

them out like a winning card 

hidden in their sleeve; these 

songs cannot be beat. They 

sound like they’re made for 

stadium tours, even though 

they incorporate typical non-

rock instrumentation like 

bombastic brass or dreamy 

keys and synthesizers. They 

both have gigantic hooks 

that practically beg to be 

screamed out loud for the whole world to hear. 

Miraculously, these aren’t the only songs that stand 

out on the record.

When Tumor begins to slow things down and 

turn a bit darker and more insular, they begin to 

shine brightest. “Hasdallen Lights” is the best 

example of this, though “Strawberry Privilege” 

and “Super Stars” deserve to be mentioned as well. 

“Hasdallen Lights” kicks off with a little warped 

guitar lick that is quickly joined by a moody string 

section, supporting Tumor as they ask questions 

like “What are your running from? / What do you 

miss? / Tell me, what do you crave? / How do you 

feel?” in a delicate falsetto, as Tumor is asking 

themself these very questions. After a couple 

of repetitions, Tumor, drenched in despair and 

reverb, finally begins to piece the answers together: 

“Her song, her song, her song … Running from my 

shadow … I miss the sound of you … trouble, trouble, 

trouble.” It is in these moments that Tumor begins 

to show who they really are and how the places 

they grew and developed in affected them.

Heaven to a Tortured Mind is the perfect follow-

up record to Safe in the Hands of Love. It takes 

Safe’s already accessible version of rock-infused 

avant-garde music and makes it simultaneously 

more rock-centric and more experimental. It’s a 

bit of a tough combination to wrangle together 

without sounding like you’re trying too hard to be 

experimental, but Tumor managed to pull it off 

with ease. Given that Heaven to a Tortured Mindl 

builds off of Safe in the Hands of Love, where Tumor 

goes next remains up in the air. They might go more 

toward rock, they might go more toward ambience 

or noise or they might go somewhere completely 

different. Tumor’s trajectory remains cloudy and 

uncertain, but that uncertainty is what makes their 

music so captivating and exciting.

There’s no better time to play “Animal Crossing: 

New Horizons” than when you’re trapped at home 

with little to do. The same can be said for most video 

games, but especially so for “New Horizons”; no 

better game could have been released on March 20, 

2020.

Animal Crossing is often called a “life-simulation” 

game, 
but 
calling 
it 
a 
“personalization” 
or 

“customization” game would be just as accurate. The 

game revolves around your character transforming 

a deserted island into a thriving village from the 

ground up, and customizing everything to your 

liking: your character, your home and as you 

progress, the island itself.

The distinguishing detail is that the game is 

played in real-time. A hallmark trait of the Animal 

Crossing series, gameplay is dictated by the clock: 

You can only catch a guppy during the day, while 

tarantulas only appear at night. The main item 

shop is only available from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. 

in the time zone you live in. Special characters 

visit only once per week; one character can only be 

found Sunday mornings from 5:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. 

Variety is the spice of life in Animal Crossing, and 

that variety is derived from when you choose to play. 

For many, quarantine amid coronavirus has opened 

the opportunity to play Animal Crossing at any time 

on any day, eliciting maximum variety.

“New Horizons” expands on its predecessors with 

more new villagers to befriend and invite to your 

island, more new bugs and fish to catch and more 

new items, styles, fashions and customizations. 

The biggest new addition is the ability to modify 

the island terrain, raising mountains and creating 

rivers to your heart’s content. That’s the core of 

Animal Crossing: creating a world to escape to. It’s 

a platform for more creativity and self-expression 

than ever before in the series’ history.

Beauty doesn’t come easy — building your dream 

island takes time. “New Horizons” makes it a 

winding journey. The game forces players to take 

everything slowly, even down to the most basic 

functions. Accessing a shop, store or service requires 

going through the same dialog over and over. Picking 

up items from the ground or depositing items into 

storage must be done one at a time. Advancements 

like recruiting a new villager, upgrading your home, 

building a bridge or ordering new items all take at 

least one day to be fulfilled. There’s very little in 

the way of immediate gratification. For some, it’s a 

way to slow down, unwind and relax. For others, it’s 

unbearable tedium.

Animal Crossing isn’t for everyone. There’s a sense 

of progression to the game, but one that’s stretched 

out over a long time. The island terrain editor, maybe 

the game’s biggest selling point, will take at least two 

weeks to unlock, even for the most optimized Animal 

Crossing aficionado. For the average player, maybe 

much longer. New crafting recipes are tantalizingly 

drip-fed, just a few each day. Commitment to daily 

play is rewarded with various bonuses and perks, 

while your villagers will make sad remarks about 

missing you when you spend long periods away. 

Many customizations are exorbitantly expensive, 

requiring lots of in-game time spent earning money 

for sometimes minor changes; if you’re no longer 

happy with where you put your house on day one, 

expect to shell out 30 thousand bells to move it.

All of this can infuriate some, but for others, it’s 

tranquility. The long-winded path to a flourishing 

Animal Crossing village creates an organic and 

natural feel to the game, encouraging your island 

to grow over time and build around early decisions 

you made much like a real-world town. There’s no 

getting straight to the point — that’s the point of 

Animal Crossing.

When I first walked into GameStop to preorder 

“New Horizons” the night before it came out, I was 

ecstatic to walk out with a copy of the game a day 

early. Ten days later I sold it to my brother at a $20 

loss. It was too easy to sink hours into the game that 

I would never see back. But if you’re looking to make 

quarantine feel a little faster, Animal Crossing is an 

addiction that could make it go by in a blur.

FILM REVIEW
Your vote in ‘Slay the Dragon’

EMMA CHANG
Daily Arts Writer

At its best, politics is stressful. At its worst, it’s a mind-

boggling maze of rules and red tape. And, as we get older, the 

messiness of our current bureaucracy becomes increasingly 

obvious, revealing a system that is much more complicated than 

Schoolhouse Rock! makes it out to be. The power we hold as 

voters is daunting to most, but to a select few, it’s a threat to their 

livelihood. Politicians are meant to be held accountable by the 

public; any AP US History student could tell you that. 

Enter the convenient practice of gerrymandering — a district 

drawing technique that takes away the threat of public opinion. 

Both political parties are guilty of dividing voting districts in a 

way that ensures them seats in state legislatures and, though 

a little bit of innocent gerrymandering might be considered 

part of the rat race of the government, such is not the way of 

politics. If your hands aren’t dirty and your inbox is clear of 

incriminating emails, you’re not doing it right. But what happens 

when citizens are fed up with the system? Is there capacity for 

change? The newest documentary from Magnolia Pictures, 

“Slay the Dragon,” answers these questions with a captivating 

story about those working to fight the corruption rampant in 

our governing bodies. 

Before considering the political connotations of “Slay the 

Dragon,” however, it’s important to note the actual storytelling 

ability of a documentary like this one. Often, these films toe the 

line between informative and boring, intriguing and emotional. 

Most run the risk of losing their audience’s attention, especially 

in these streaming-heavy days of quarantine. But “Slay the 

Dragon” weaves a fantastical tale about gerrymandering 

beginning with impressive visuals and graphics that highlight 

the strange nature of strategic redistricting. 

As the opening credits roll, “Slay the Dragon” forces its 

audiences to consider what it actually means to “re-district” 

with an animated line carving its way through a city. The 

image establishes the concept of gerrymandering as something 

concrete, setting up the intimate relationship between an 

audience and a major character of the film. As the story 

progresses, the visuals become ever more important in showing 

the increasingly questionable practice of gerrymandering. At 

one point, watching “Slay the Dragon” was similar to trying to 

find the constellations — the audience stares at indiscernible, 

odd shapes that take on no meaning until a detailed drawing is 

put over it. But the effect remained. “Slay the Dragon” was able 

to emphasize the absurdity of gerrymandering with a few well-

placed examples of specific districts. 

Beyond the graphics, “Slay the Dragon” also provided an 

excellent story. There were many beginnings to this story — 2016, 

when Katie Fahey started her quest against gerrymandering; 

2010, when Project REDMAP began flipping state legislatures; 

even 2020, the first census year since many of these anti-

gerrymandering laws were put into place. However you decide 

to define the start, it’s obvious what “Slay the Dragon” is about: 

the rise and hopefully coming fall of gerrymandering in the 

United States. 

 But is it really that simple? In an age of political unrest, “Slay 

the Dragon” provides a hopeful message for those of us just about 

to come of age in this important election year. In a speech after 

the anti-gerrymandering proposal was passed in Michigan, 

Katie Fahey is seen telling her campaign team how important 

every one of their actions is. The underlying message that every 

action, every vote is essential to the success of democracy is one 

that we could all stand to remember, regardless of what year it is.

The eye-opening moments of a documentary should be 

few and far between — a good documentary should make its 

audience reflect and question what’s presented to them. The 

immediate nature of an “eye-opening” moment is the opposite 

of conversation-sparking. “Slay the Dragon” understands 

this and, though it is very left-leaning, it still manages to 

present its audiences with a strong and informative message 

about gerrymandering. It highlights the importance of every 

citizen’s participation in democracy, making it one of the better 

documentaries to watch.

Witches, spinsters 

and lesbians

Sylvia Townsend Warner, “Lolly 

Willowes”

The cover of my copy of Sylvia 

Townsend 
Warner’s 
first 
novel 

is decorated with a drawing of a 

witch by August Neter. Neter was 

an outsider artist, one of Hans 

Prinzhorn’s “schizophrenic masters,” 

whose art was an attempt to capture 

his hallucinations. The image depicts 

the profile of a short-haired woman 

covered in plants, roads and animals, 

an effect that suggests a map. It’s an 

apt choice on the part of the publisher: 

Warner’s style resembles Neter’s 

double image in its porous curiosity 

and naturalistic oddness. It’s also apt 

because the novel is about a witch. The 

witchiness here is less Shakespearean 

and more ordinary, spinster-ish; 

Warner suggests that the closest 

relative to the witch is the unmarried 

tradeswoman or the country wife who 

prepares her own dandelion wine. 

Written in the 1920s, the novel seems 

to suggest that someone can become a 

witch simply by refusing the trappings 

of polite society, by “politely declining 

to make the expected connection with 

the opposite sex,” as John Updike (of 

all people) puts it on the back cover of 

my copy. 

We first see the titular Laura 

Willowes (called Lolly by her niece, 

a nickname that sticks) moving in 

with her brother Henry and his wife 

Caroline after the death of their father. 

It’s a move from the countryside to 

London. Caroline describes Laura 

in passing as “a gentle creature” and 

then turns to logistics: a writing desk 

has to be moved, a bureau that another 

relative wanted is allocated to “small 

spare room” in which “aunt Lolly” 

will live. The rest of the novel is, in 

part, an elaboration on what Caroline 

missed. Laura won’t become a witch 

until the last third of the novel, but 

even before then she has a strangely 

textured inner life and a tendency 

to feel out strange essences from 

ordinary surfaces. We next see a very 

young Laura stealing into the room 

where her great-aunt’s disused harp 

collects dust and plucking the strings, 

which “answered with a melancholy 

and distracted voice.” She then dwells 

on the lock of her great-aunt’s hair 

that was embroidered into a picture 

of a willow tree as something of a 

memento mori. 

 Hints of morbidity and the occult 

are common in Warner’s evocation 

of English country life. Laura’s 

childhood with her father is quiet 

and practical, to be sure, but there’s 

suggestion of rural magic everywhere. 

She helps her father out in his 

brewery, gathers medicinal herbs 

from the forests, climbs trees, absorbs 

traditional remedies and age-old 

practices from the “country servants 

of long tenure.” While her brothers 

Henry and James get shuttled off into 

professional life, Laura stays with 

her father and notes how one servant 

makes traditional beeswax polish 

and fills the house with “a resinous 

smell” and how another recommends 

infusions of nettles and mugwort for 

longevity. She’s content to continue 

living like this, and has an antipathy 

toward marriage that she never loses. 

Her father doesn’t push the point. She 

becomes instead the mistress of the 

house with “an easy diligence.” 

When her father dies and Laura 

moves to Henry’s house in London, 

she brings her preternatural intuition 

to bear on the rhythms of life in the 

city. Henry and Caroline are people 

with customs and routines in place 

of personalities, but Warner still has 

a flair for catching the shadow that 

follows each gesture. At one point 

she describes Henry winding the 

grandfather clock in the hall — “first 

one and then the other the quivering 

chains were wound up, till only the 

snouts of the leaden weights were 

visible, drooping sullenly over the 

abyss of time wherein they were 

to make their descent during the 

seven days following.” This image, 

at once bleak and Carroll-esque, 

captures well the feeling of dullness 

that starts to weigh on Laura as she 

settles into her new life. Even so, the 

satire is even-handed and just. Laura’s 

relatives aren’t caricatures, they’re 

just ordinary middle-class English 

people, and that’s the problem. We get 

a sense of Laura’s strangeness, not the 

uniqueness of her quiet subjugation. 

 Laura is twenty-nine at this point 

and it’s 1902, meaning her prospects 

for marriage are increasingly unlikely. 

Caroline and Henry occasionally 

host Eligible Bachelors, but Laura 

determinedly ignores them or says 

eccentric things to them and after a 

while everyone involved stops trying. 

Laura 
then 
becomes 
something 

like an unpaid housekeeper to her 

brother’s family. There are long 

passages that list her duties, which 

range from the arrangement of 

flowers to embroidery to looking after 

her nieces. After nearly twenty years 

of this Laura starts to long for more, 

starts to feel tempted to leave. She is 

finally persuaded to do so after seeing 

canned fruit and homemade preserves 

in a “countrified” shop while running 

errands: she has a sudden vision of 

herself staring up at an apple tree 

late in the season, reaching up for 

the fruit outlined against the fading 

grey sky. That night, she announces 

to her relations that she’s moving 

to Great Mop, a small town in the 

Chilterns. She ignores their indignant 

protests (“now Lolly, what you want is 

absurd!”) and sets off the next day. 

Just as Warner avoids generalizing 

about her characters, she also avoids 

panoramas and self-conscious theses. 

It would have been easy to write this 

book in a manner that presented 

opposites — the stiflingly domestic 

world of Caroline and Henry’s house 

and the totally free world of country 

life. When Laura arrives in Great Mop 

her newfound independence is rather 

vexing. She spends her days exploring 

the area on foot for hours and ends up 

exhausting herself. “She knew in her 

heart that she was not really enjoying 

this sort of thing, but the habit of 

useless activity was too strong to be 

snapped by a change of scene.”

The complications of playing football this fall

Of all the people within 

college football, Chip Kelly 

provided a font of wisdom on 

Thursday.

“The 

governors 

of 
the 

states and 

mayors 

are going 

to be the 

ones who 

tell 
you 

whether 

we can (come back),” the 

UCLA coach told reporters 

Thursday. “Because the NCAA 

can say, ‘Hey, you guys are all 

going back,’ and if (California) 

Governor 
(Gavin) 
Newsom 

says, ‘We’re not going back,’ 

then we’re not going back.”

Through 
the 
muck 

of 
inarguable 
fact, 
that 

underscores the only hard 

conclusion anyone can have 

right now regarding college 

football’s eventual return and 

the 
ever-present 
possibility 

of its delay: Playing games 

in September is going to 

be an immense challenge. 

And anyone trying to speak 

authoritatively on the subject is 

either lying or delusional.

This 
would 
include 

Oklahoma State coach Mike 

Gundy, who said this week 

that he aims to have football 

employees come back by May 1, 

with players following shortly.

“They are 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 

years old and they are healthy 

and they have the ability to fight 

this virus off,” Gundy said. “If 

that is true, then we sequester 

them, and we continue because 

we need to run money through 

the state of Oklahoma.”

Setting aside the obvious 

stupidity and tone-deafness 

of that suggestion (which 

was quickly scuttled by the 

Big 12), it gives a window into 

why college football can’t take 

the same route professional 

leagues 
have 
reportedly 

looked into: bring players and 

staff back under quarantine 

from the general public, put 

them all in the same place 

and have them play games 

on practice fields or in empty 

stadiums. 

As the people who run college 

sports are quick to remind us, 

athletes are students. This, 

we’re told, is why they can’t be 

paid in accordance with the 

millions of dollars they bring 

in to universities. And this is 

why they can’t be treated any 

different in the face of a global 

pandemic.

If it’s not safe for thousands 

of students to return to campus 

in the fall, then unpaid athletes 

certainly can’t be forced to 

come back and play. So rule that 

option out. 

For the sake of argument, 

let’s suppose that by the fall, 

COVID-19 is under enough 

control that classes can happen 

in-person. When it comes to 

football at the University of 

Michigan, you then run into 

a refrain that gets repeated 

when you ask around about the 

subject: Are you going to feel 

safe going to a stadium with 

100,000 people in September?

OK, well, let’s say you play it 

without fans. Are people still 

tailgating? Is that considered 

dangerous? 
What 
about 

people watching at bars and 

restaurants, 
which 
would 

surely grow in number if 

nobody can attend games in 

person?

It should be pointed out that 

these concerns are fairly deep 

in the weeds. Logistically, they 

fall behind questions like, what 

happens if one state gives the 

OK and another doesn’t? Or, 

what if traveling and staying 

in hotels every other weekend 

still 
constitutes 
risk? 
Let 

alone, could the system handle 

a player or coach getting 

coronavirus without shutting 

down entirely? 

And 
that’s 
without 

mentioning the obvious: If 

people are still dying in large 

numbers, it’s not appropriate 

to have a large sporting event 

where anyone might be put at 

risk. If playing requires testing 

everyone on the field, and such 

testing takes resources away 

from hospitals that need it, 

forget about it.

The financial incentive to 

play college football, even with 

no fans, with a delayed season 

or both, is massive. Michigan, 

along with every other FBS 

athletic department, makes 

most of its money from the 

sport. Without it, non-revenue 

sports 
will 
be 
drastically 

affected. Jobs will be lost. 

So will scholarships. College 

careers that people worked 

their whole lives for, ruined.

ESPN’s 
Adam 
Schefter 

reported Thursday that there 

is a “strong conviction” among 

people in college football to 

play this year, in some way, 

shape or form. That’s much of 

the motivation as to why.

But Schefter tweeted that 

at 4:10. At 4:15, Illinois Gov. 

J.B. Pritzker said, “I think 

everybody needs to think 

seriously about canceling large 

summer events. From my 

perspective today, I don’t see 

how we’re going to have large 

gatherings of people, again, 

until we have a vaccine, which 

is months and months away.” 

At 4:25, Los Angeles public 

county health director Barbara 

Ferrer said, “We’re going to 

come out at the other end in a 

matter of weeks,” but that of 

course comes with the caveat 

that Newsom, the governor in 

her state, shot down the idea of 

sports returning anytime soon 

just a few days ago.

This decision is not just 

going to be made by people in 

college football.

This is to make two points. 

First, there is a myriad of 

opinions 
and 
information, 

and it’s going too fast for 

anyone to keep up. Making 

a 
coherent 
prediction 
out 

of that is impossible, but on 

aggregate, 
it 
doesn’t 
look 

good. Second, having college 

sports requires everyone — 

the federal government, 50 

state governments, localities, 

school administrators, coaches, 

athletes themselves — to be on 

the same page.

Does that seem likely to you 

right now?

Playing college football in 2020 could be difficult, with or without fans.

How Zach Charbonnet fits into a crowded running backs room

It only took one game 

for 
running 
back 
Zach 

Charbonnet to draw lofty 

comparisons.

Last August, the most 

impressive 
statistic 
from 

Charbonnet’s college debut 

wasn’t his 90 rushing yards. 

Rather, in Michigan’s 40-21 

win over Middle Tennessee 

State, 
it 
was 
the 
true 

freshman’s 
pass 
blocking 

that stood out most. He 

picked up nine blitzes in as 

many tries, showing strength 

in an area of the game that 

often keeps highly-touted 

freshmen off the field.

He became the program’s 

fourth true freshman to start 

at running back in the season 

opener since 1944, and he 

left a lasting impression in 

doing so.

“I don’t think we’ve had 

a back get nine pickups in a 

protection since we’ve been 

here, one single back,” coach 

Jim Harbaugh said at the 

time. “And to be 100 percent, 

nine out of nine, that’s like, 

‘Wow.’ That’s really good. … 

He just was handling it, with 

not even a misstep. That’s 

rare.

“I’ve had pro guys that 

don’t 
understand 
the 

protections 
as 
well 
as 

(Charbonnet) in this game.”

When tight ends coach 

Sherrone Moore touched on 

it later that week, he likened 

Charbonnet to a former 

college teammate of his own.

“I’ve only seen one other 

freshman back block like 

that, and that’s a guy I played 

with,” Moore said. “That was 

really impressive to watch, 

nine-for-nine 
in 
pickups, 

just go up and strike people 

and never back down and 

know who to block with all 

the exotic pressures (Middle 

Tennessee State) brought.”

The 
other 
freshman 

back? 
That 
would 
be 

future NFL Hall-of-Famer 

Adrian 
Peterson, 
who 

played alongside Moore at 

Oklahoma 15 years ago.

For 
Charbonnet, 
pass 

blocking was only one bullet 

point on a long list of tests 

he aced as a true freshman. 

After rehabbing a surgically-

repaired 
meniscus 
last 

spring, 
his 
11 
rushing 

touchdowns 

set 
a 
new 

program 

record among 

freshman 

running 

backs. 
On 

his 
way, 
he 

also 
showed 

glimpses as a 

receiver 
and 

an ability to 

get it done in short down-

and-distance situations.

Just 
days 
after 
being 

the subject of praise from 

Harbaugh 
and 
Moore, 

Charbonnet 
followed 

through with another big 

game. 
In 

week 
two, 

he 
posted 

100 rushing 

yards 

and 
three 

touchdowns, 

the 
last 

of 
which 

helped 

Michigan 

escape 

unranked Army in double-

overtime.

The performance earned 

him a Big Ten Freshman 

of the Week nod, but the 

33-carry workload took a 

clear toll on his recently-

repaired 
knee, 
deviating 

from 
the 
Wolverines’ 

preferred 
running 
back 

by 
committee 
approach. 

Charbonnet carried the ball 

more than 15 times just once 

over Michigan’s remaining 

11 games, even though the 

Wolverines’ coaching staff 

insisted he was in good 

health.

While Charbonnet’s ideal 

career 
trajectory 
would 

include a major bump in 

usage this fall, it’s difficult 

to 
see 
that 
coming 
to 

fruition. He proved himself 

as 
a 
capable 
workhorse 

back while at his best last 

season, but the improvement 

of 
converted-linebacker 

Hassan Haskins and the 

return of suspended running 

back 
Chris 
Evans 
could 

put a dent in Charbonnet’s 

workload.

Over Michigan’s last five 

games 
in 
2019, 
Haskins 

logged 62 carries compared 

to Charbonnet’s 40. And 

with the stakes at their 

highest against top-ranked 

Ohio State, it was Haskins 

(12 rushes) who emerged 

as the go-to guy — not 

Charbonnet (four rushes).

In offensive coordinator 

Josh 
Gattis’ 
up-tempo 

system, 
having 
multiple 

starting-caliber 
running 

backs 
works 
in 
the 

Wolverines’ 
favor. 
Even 

if 
his 
carry 
totals 
dip, 

Charbonnet’s 
efficiency 

stands 
to 
benefit 
from 

another offseason in the 

weight room, the experience 

of starting as a freshman 

and 
additional 
time 
to 

recover from last year’s knee 

surgery.

“You could just tell by the 

way Zach carries himself,” 

Moore said last September. 

“He’s all about his business, 

very mature for his age. 

And, obviously, he’s a special 

talent.”

In Charbonnet’s case, it’s 

the little things that can 

keep him on the field. And in 

2020, all it might take is an 

extra blitz pickup.

What Michigan’s young corps learned from national team tryouts

Three players from the 2019 

Michigan 
volleyball 
roster 

were invited to the USA College 

National Team tryouts. In 

the fall, they accounted for a 

combined 56.8 percent of the 

Wolverines’ kills, 48.4 percent 

of their blocks and 44.6 percent 

of their serving aces.

Another key fact about them: 

All three are underclassmen.

Sophomore outside hitter 

Paige Jones is the oldest of 

the three, being invited after 

a season where she topped 

the team with 463 kills. Jones’ 

attack power slotted her as 

the Wolverines’ top offensive 

weapon and secured her a 

unanimous selection to the All-

Big Ten First Team.

Middle 
blocker 
Jess 

Robinson and opposite hitter 

May 
Pertofsky, 
meanwhile, 

both received invitations fresh 

off of All-Big Ten Freshman 

Team nominations. Pertofsky 

and Robinson were second and 

third on the team in blocks and 

third and fourth on the team in 

kills, respectively.

Even with just 204 college 

athletes 
from 
across 
the 

country taking part in the 

National Team tryout, it’s 

clear why Michigan’s young 

core were invited. But while 

their basis of selection may 

be evident, the Wolverines’ 

experience at the tryout was 

not as easily predicted.

The underclassmen knew 

they would be separated into 

three waves and participate in 

many drills over the course of 

the three-day February tryout 

in Colorado Springs, Colo. They 

knew that they would be split 

up by position and ranked by 

evaluators. They knew they 

would be separated from their 

teammates.

But they didn’t know just 

how much that might impact 

them.

“It 
was 
really 

individualistic,” Robinson said. 

“When we came back, the first 

thing our coaches asked us was 

to share one thing we thought 

we had learned at USA, and 

the first thing that I said was 

‘teammates.’ ”

Robinson was offered a 

position on one of the national 

teams and turned it down. 

She cited her desire to work 

with her own team in Ann 

Arbor over the summer as the 

primary reason why. 

Robinson 
wasn’t 
alone. 

Pertofsky, who was offered an 

alternate position, declined for 

the sake of her team as well.

“I think the biggest lasting 

impact for me, honestly, would 

be I never really realized 

how important having a real 

connection with the people 

you’re 
playing 
around 
is,” 

Pertofsky said.

“I remember I was blocking 

with a bunch of different 

middles, and then I went on a 

court with Jess (Robinson) and 

we were just super connected 

and super fluid, and it was fun. 

It just felt right.”

For the rest of the time, when 

it didn’t feel ‘right,’ the tryout 

was something new for all three 

Wolverines. It forced them out 

of their comfort zone and asked 

them to perform at the highest 

level possible without their 

Michigan teammates in order 

to impress the college coaches 

who served as evaluators. For 

Michigan coach Mark Rosen, 

who served as one of the 

evaluators, that lack of comfort 

was exactly what he wanted for 

his players. 

“For us to learn, for us to 

grow, and for us to get better, 

we have to be uncomfortable,” 

Rosen said. “We have to 

struggle. We have to fail. … I 

want them to struggle, and not 

because I want them to not 

feel great, but I just know it’s 

what they’re going to get better 

from.”

One of the largest struggles 

for the players at the tryout will 

be an important adjustment 

in the fall — adapting to a new 

setter. 
Experienced 
senior 

setter 
MacKenzi 
Welsh 

played her final season at 

Michigan this past fall, and the 

Wolverines will need to find a 

new rhythm with a fresh setter, 

whether that setter is former 

freshman Maddie Dowd or 

incoming freshman Jenni Liu. 

Jones, a player Rosen described 

as a strong tempo hitter, ran 

into some struggles with the 

constant switching of setters at 

the tryout.

“It was a little tough trying to 

connect with the setters there,” 

Jones said. “It was a good 

lesson to learn that we both had 

to adapt and it wasn’t on one 

person … but it was definitely a 

challenge.”

Jones didn’t bat an eye, 

however, at the insecurity 

of losing Welsh, citing the 

adaptability she, Robinson and 

Pertofsky learned in Colorado 

Springs as a key factor in the 

transition. “It can only go up 

from here,” Jones said. “It was 

nice that we had young players 

last year because now that we 

have that we’re able to just 

keep them and build off of their 

experiences that they had last 

year.”

The Wolverines will enter 

their upcoming season with 

just two seniors on the roster, 

only one of whom was in the 

starting rotation last year. 

And its young core looks ready 

to become a force come fall. 

Michigan is replacing seven 

seniors from a year ago and 

will have to rely on all levels of 

players to find success.

But after their tryouts, the 

Wolverines aren’t worrying 

much about experience or 

talent. They believe one thing 

to be more important than 

anything else: teamwork.

Jayde Riviere relishing journey from World Cup to Ann Arbor

For many students, the 

summer 
before 
heading 

to college is filled with 

leisure time and bittersweet 

memories with high school 

friends.

Not for Jayde Riviere.

But she’s not your typical 

18-year old. For her last 

summer as a high school 

student, she was in France 

representing Canada in the 

2019 FIFA Women’s World 

Cup. 

But before she competed 

on soccer’s biggest stage, 

Riviere sat in a training 

camp in Spain with no idea if 

she was going to be selected 

to the Canadian squad. At 

the end of the camp, all of 

the players were led into 

a dark room. The lights 

flipped on and projected 

onto a board were the names 

of the final World Cup team.

The celebrations erupted. 

Riviere said that she almost 

broke down in tears when 

she realized she was going 

to France.

“For me, the World Cup 

is huge,” Riviere said. “It 

defines women’s soccer. The 

FIFA Women’s World Cup — 

everyone knows about it. To 

be a part of it at a young age, 

no one can take that away 

from me.”

Being 
the 
second-

youngest member of the 

team, 
Riviere 
felt 
that 

connecting 
with 
the 

veterans 
was 
important. 

36-year-old 
star 
forward 

Christine 
Sinclair 
took 

Riviere under her wing and 

when she was handed a start 

in the second match of the 

group stages against New 

Zealand, Sinclair challenged 

her to bring her A-game. It 

ended up being one of her 

best performances for the 

national team, and Canada 

cruised to a 2-0 victory. 

“My 
coach 
likes 
to 

say that if you don’t get 

butterflies or anything with 

an international match then 

there’s 
something 
wrong 

with 
us,” 
Riviere 
said. 

“There’s obviously a lot of 

pressure to be representing 

my country. Always a sense 

of pride and pressure when 

you’re wearing that jersey 

and have that badge over 

your heart.”

Riviere was selected for 

a reason. With her pace 

and attacking qualities, she 

fit in well at the wingback 

position. Canada finished in 

second place in their group, 

advancing to the knockout 

stages. Unfortunately for 

Riviere and her teammates, 

her run ended in a 1-0 loss to 

Sweden in the Round of 16. 

***

For 
Riviere, 
playing 

soccer 
isn’t 
just 
about 

winning games or scoring 

goals. It’s about family. Her 

father, Antony Riviere, grew 

up playing soccer in the 

island nation of Dominica. 

He taught her everything he 

knows about the game.

But 
Antony 
wasn’t 

the only member of the 

family who helped teach 

her 
about 
the 
game. 

One of her role models 

growing up — alongside 

Sinclair, 
Ronaldinho 
and 

Cristiano Ronaldo — was 

her 
late-grandfather, 

Arlington 
Riviere. 

Arlington 
saw 
promise 

in his granddaughter and 

wanted Jayde to be just as 

invested in her academics 

as her athletics. Arlington 

was never able to see her 

represent Canada or play at 

Michigan. He passed away 

when she was young. But 

playing soccer allows her to 

stay connected to her role 

model.

“I was kind of like his 

favorite 
granddaughter,” 

Riviere said. “Every time 

I walk on the field I do 

the sign of the cross and I 

always point to him because 

I know he has the best seat 

right now.”

That 
emphasis 
on 

academics 
was 
part 
of 

the reason Riviere ended 

up at Michigan. In her 

recruiting process, she had 

it narrowed down to two 

schools: Michigan and West 

Virginia. Riviere chose to 

come to Ann Arbor partly 

because she planned on 

graduating college, and saw 

value in getting a degree 

from Michigan.

During an era in which 

growing numbers of players 

are 
choosing 
to 
forgo 

college altogether, Riviere 

is playing the long game.

“Because of my success, 

I’ve had agents reach out,” 

Riviere 
said. 
“But 
my 

answer has been the same 

for every agent — I’m going 

to continue to do my four 

years at Michigan and get 

my 
diploma 
from 
there 

and after that, the doors 

can open up to anything 

professional-wise.”

When Michigan coach 

Jennifer Klein accepted the 

job two years ago, Riviere 

was already committed to 

playing for the Wolverines.

“One of the big things 

about Michigan and Canada 

is there is a connection 

between the two programs,” 

Klein said. “Michigan has 

had a lot of great Canadians 

that have been part of our 

program so that relationship 

was created years ago and 

we’ve just been able to 

continue to develop that 

relationship.”

Riviere 
was 
initially 

recruited to play as a wide 

forward 
closer 
to 
the 

goal. But, as she became 

more involved with the 

national team she shifted 

to the wingback role which 

combines 
the 
defensive 

duties 
of 
a 
traditional 

outside 
back 
with 
the 

attacking 
responsibilities 

of a winger. The Canadian 

national 
team 
let 
the 

Michigan 
coaching 
staff 

know they preferred Riviere 

to be deployed in a more 

defensive role at fullback to 

continue her development.

“Defensively 
her 

individual ability, her speed 

is good,” Klein said. “I think 

those skill sets allow her 

to be impactful within our 

group and I’m just excited 

for the experience that she’s 

going to gain being with the 

Canadian team.

“I think she has the ability 

to be a major contributor for 

our program. I think as the 

season went on last year you 

could see that she has the 

ability to take a game on and 

really capitalize and put the 

ball in the back of the net 

when the team needs it.”

***

Due to the postponement 

of the summer Olympics, 

Riviere is planning on using 

this summer to do online 

classes and said that as of 

right now the Wolverines 

are preparing to play in the 

fall. She has kept in touch 

with 
teammates 
during 

quarantine, 
using 
Zoom 

to reach out to incoming 

freshmen 
and 
returning 

players. 
Even 
though 

Riviere had her eyes on 

Tokyo, she is still focused 

on the upcoming fall season.

“There 
will 
definitely 

be a kind of new flair to 

Michigan,” Riviere said. “I 

believe that we’re trying 

out new platforms, maybe 

new players in different 

positions kind of having a 

more versatile team. I think 

we obviously want to win a 

Big Ten (championship) and 

we want to win an NCAA 

Tournament. I think we set 

the bar last season and now 

it’s just about raising that 

bar.”

Riviere has already played 

on some of the world’s 

biggest stages in women’s 

soccer. Now she’s ready to 

bring that experience and 

flair to Michigan.
