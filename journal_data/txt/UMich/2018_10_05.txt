ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
Victors 
for 

Michigan 
fundraising 

campaign has raised more 

than $5 billion, University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

announced 
Thursday 
to 
a 

crowd of about 200 people 
during his annual Leadership 
Breakfast at the Ross School of 
Business.

As Schlissel told the group, 

the record is a nationwide 
first.

“I’m thrilled to announce 

here today that the University 
of Michigan is now the first 
public university ever to raise 
$5 billion in a fundraising 
campaign,” 
Schlissel 
said. 

“It’s 
the 
most 
successful 

campaign in our history and 
in the history of public higher 
education.”

Nearly 200 students and 

representatives 
from 
four 

student organizations at the 
University of Michigan came 
together in Jeff T. Blau Hall 
Thursday night for “Cultural 
Crossroads,” an event designed 
to unite minority groups across 
lines of race, religion and 
cultural heritage. LSA senior 
Yezenia Sandoval, the external 
director for the Latinx Alliance 
for Community Action, Support 
and Advocacy, had the original 
idea 
for 
the 
event, 
which 

included a mixture of cultural 
foods, dances and dialogues.

“The main point of this 

event 
is 
to 
highlight 
the 

intersectionality 
between 

different 
communities 
on 

campus and just celebrate our 
cultural differences,” Sandoval 
said. “We thought it would

Stand With Survivors protests Kavanaugh 
nomination, calls for action against abuse

DANYEL THARAKAN/Daily

Protestors march chanting pro-survivor and anti-Kavanaugh slogans at the Stand with Survivors rally against the Kavanaugh confirmation originating on the Diag Thursday. 

Hundred gather for rally, protest in University Diag ahead of Senate confirmation vote Friday

More than 100 students and 

community members gathered 
in the Diag Thursday evening 
to stand with survivors and 
protest 
the 
nomination 
of 

Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. The rally was 
one of dozens taking place 

nationwide, all organized by 
the group Women’s March.

Thursday 
morning, 
the 

White 
House 
announced 

the 
FBI 
had 
concluded 

an 
investigation 
into 

accusations of sexual assault 
and 
misconduct 
against 

Kavanaugh. The investigation 
was 
launched 
following 

testimony 
by 
psychologist 

Christine Blasey Ford, who 

asserts Kavanaugh assaulted 
her at a gathering in the 
summer of 1982. Ford is one of 
three women to publicly accuse 
Kavanaugh of sexual assault or 
misconduct.

Kavanagh has vehemently 

denied 
these 
accusations, 

claiming they are a partisan 
attack on his nomination.

At 
marches 
across 
the 

country, survivors and allies 

cried out for justice. Lindsey 
Brown, a sophomore at Eastern 
Michigan University, came to 
Ann Arbor to be a part of the 
rally.

“I think when we look back 

we are going to see a clear 
divide of who was on the right 
side of history and who was on 
the side of history that didn’t 
want to listen to survivors 
and the people who have been 

systematically 
oppressed,” 

Brown said.

Schools in the Ann Arbor 

Public Schools district have 
been found to have elevated 
levels of lead in their drinking 
water.

Multiple schools measured 

well over 15 ppb, including 
sites at Angell Elementary 
School, 
Clague 
Middle 

School, Skyline High School, 
Forsythe 
Middle 
School 

and Burns Park Elementary 
School—the last two logging 
lead levels of 120 and 320 
ppb, respectively. According 
to the Center for Disease 
Control, lead exposure can 
negatively impact the nervous 
system and brain development, 
especially in young children. 
The Environmental Protection 
Agency 
recommends 
that 

action be taken when there is 
more than 15 parts per billion 
of lead in water.

Coleman, 
launched 
the 

campaign in 2013, and more 
than 382,000 donors have 
contributed since. The $5 
billion in funds includes $1.1 
billion for student support, 
surpassing 
the 
campaign’s 

designated $1 billion goal. 
Schlissel 
emphasized 
the 

importance of the school’s 
$11 billion endowment and 
fundraising efforts like the 
Victors 
campaign 
to 
the 

University and its reputation.

“The difference between 

Michigan being a very good 
public university in the Big 
Ten and being one of the global 
leaders in higher education 
and research is the Victors 
campaign,” Schlissel said.

Schlissel thanked donors 

for their support, including 
Richard and Susan Rogel, 
who 
committed 
$150 

million to the University of 
Michigan 
Comprehensive 

Cancer Center in March. The 

center was renamed the Rogel 
Cancer Center in their honor. 
Schlissel said the donation 
was the largest gift in the 
history of Michigan Medicine.

Eric R. Fearon, the center’s 

director, said the donation 
helped 
to 
advance 
cancer 

research 
and 
technology 

while 
providing 
support 

to hire new scientists and 
offer scholarships to medical 
students.

“Philanthropy is critical,” 

Fearon said. “It allows us 
to launch high-risk, high-
reward research and support 
promising young faculty, as 
well as senior faculty, to pursue 
new directions in their work. 
It provides the foundation 
to generate the preliminary 
studies and data needed to be 
successful in obtaining federal 
grant funding.”

During 
a 
question-and-

answer 
session, 
sociology 

lecturer Ian Robinson asked 
Schlissel about the possibility 
of including the University’s 
Flint and Dearborn campuses 
in the Go Blue Guarantee, 
which promises free tuition 

for in-state students in Ann 
Arbor who have with family 
incomes under $65,000.

“I’m 
wondering 
with 

the kind of resources the 
University 
has, 
based 
on 

the 
capital 
campaign’s 

extraordinary success, if it 
wouldn’t be possible to do that, 
to extend the Go Blue promise 
to those campuses, where a 
much higher percentage of the 
students probably qualify for 
that,” Robinson said.

Schlissel said the Go Blue 

Guarantee in Ann Arbor was 
“driven by the fact that we 
don’t have nearly adequate 
economic diversity on this 
campus,” whereas the Flint 
and Dearborn campuses have 
higher levels of socioeconomic 
diversity. He also said because 
the 
three 
campuses 
have 

separate finances, Ann Arbor 
did not have the financial 
means to extend the Go 
Blue Guarantee to the other 
campuses.

“What I think we need 

to do together, to be honest, 
is the state of Michigan is 
49th of the 50 states in their 

direct-to-student support 
for 
need-based 
student 

scholarships,” 
Schlissel 

said. “State governments 
have to step in and protect 
and support their citizens, 
and even a great university 
like Michigan can’t replace 
the state government.”

Parity 
between 

campuses 
has 
been 
a 

longstanding 
source 

of 
tension. 
Last 
year, 

the 
University’s 

lecturers’ union lobbied 
for the same salary levels 
for members teaching on 
the Flint and Dearborn 
campuses. 
Schlissel’s 

remarks 
about 
varying 

economic 
diversity 
is 

largely correct — students 
on 
the 
University’s 

other 
campuses 
come 

from 
lower-income 

backgrounds, 
according 

to data from the Equality 
of Opportunity project. 
The medican household 
incomes of students on the 
Flint campus is $105,200 

and $94,500 for students in 
Dearborn, as compared to the 
$154,000 median on the Ann 
Arbor campus.

The 
Thursday 
breakfast 

was Schlissel’s final formal 
leadership convening of his 
current term. Last month, 
the Regents voted to extend 
the president’s contract by 
another five years.

Schlissel’s 
pledge 
comes 

after the Regents meeting in 
September, where students 
criticized 
the 
University 

for the size of its carbon 
footprint and urged it to 
do more to combat climate 
change. Engineering junior 
Logan Vear is a member of the 
Climate 
Action 
Movement, 

which has been advocating 
for a commitment to carbon 
neutrality on campus since 
the beginning of the year 
by pressuring the Board of 
Regents 
and 
Schlissel 
to 

commit to carbon neutrality.

Vear 
said 
Schlissel’s 

commitment was a “great 
start” in the discussion of 
carbon neutrality, but noted 
the lack of “minutiae” in his 
announcement.

“Within his comment, there 

was no explicit statement 
committing 
the 
University 

to 
carbon 
neutrality, 
but 

rather, commiting to ‘putting 
U-M on a trajectory towards 
carbon neutrality and levels of 
greenhouse gas release that are 
environmentally sustainable’ 
which does not clearly define 
what the exact scope of the 
reduction goal may be,” Vear 
wrote. “Additionally, he failed 
to present a deadline in which 
this ‘goal’ may be achieved. 
Therefore, although we are 
gratified 
to 
see 
progress 

towards this complex issue, 
we will continue to push for 
a concrete date as well as the 
establishment of intermediate 
goals to get there. We are 
excited 
to 
continue 
this 

conversation.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
You should know that one neighbor spent nine months 

constantly, and I mean daily, dealing with city, University police and 
Greek life entities before one of these party houses set up by members of 
a banned fraternity was shut down. This is a real problem. Others in this 
neighborhood must constantly deal with trash, public drunkenness, loud 
music and other violations of city ordinances. Oversight of these groups 
is not done at the national level despite the claims of their attorneys. 
Oversight by the University and the Office of Greek Life does not seem 
to make much difference.”

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA sophomore 
Leah Graham covered President Schlissel’s Leadership Breakfast 
where he made major announcements on behalf of the University’s 
trajectory..

“The Leadership Breakfast was definitely a change of pace from other 
events, even ones involving other major university figures. It was fairly 
serious. Everybody was in business attire and they all had personalized 
name tags. President Schlissel’s remarks lasted for about an hour, and 
I sat at the back with the other reporters while photographers kind of 
milled around. Overall it was great a experience, and the event gave a 
pretty comprehensive survey of some of the main things that matter 
to the University right now, from fundraising efforts to fighting climate 
change.”

Health 
Sciences 
at 
the 

University of Michigan, said 
lead exposure can lead to 
inattention 
and 
behavioral 

issues.

“Especially 
the 

neurocognition 
effects; 
I 

think that’s where everyone 
focuses their attention these 
days, again, which can lead 
to all inattention, (trouble in 
school) and so on,” Nriagu 
said.

The Detroit Public Schools 

district announced in August 
that it was shutting off its 
water sources because of high 
lead levels.

AAPS 
has 
voluntarily 

tested 
its 
water 
for 
lead 

annually 
since 
2016. 

According to 2016 and 2017 

water 
amendment 
reports, 

all AAPS schools excluding 
Huron 
High 
School 
had 

detectable amounts of lead in 
the water. Thirteen schools 
had at least one water source 
test above 15 parts per billion.

Nriagu said the Burns Park 

lead results are shocking.

“I’m shocked that we can let 

something like that happen,” 
Nriagu said. “The exposure in 
children in schools is such a 
high level of risk.”

This year’s lead testing 

began this week.

Christine Stead, president 

of the AAPS School Board, 
said buildings had not been in 
use at the time of testing and 
that could have contributed to 
the high lead readings.

“We did the testing when 

most of our buildings were not 
in use,” Stead said. “That was a 
timing issue that was a known 

issue but unfortunately the 
water (intelligence) firm that 
we used could not do it any 
other time.”

According to Stead, faucets 

were replaced if a site tested 
above 15 parts per billion. The 
district is also adding new 
water bottle stations that have 
lead filters. Stead believes this 
is why Huron High School 
did not have detectable lead 
amounts.

“In 2016, we had two sites 

(at Huron) … one read high, 
so we replaced that faucet,” 
Stead said. “That doesn’t mean 
we won’t do something else in 
2018. This is our commitment 
to monitor this and see how 
things go.”

“We would love to get to 

zero parts per billion because 
no lead in the water is good,” 
Stead added. “We also know 
that our city water is at least 3 

ppb for lead … Each year we’ve 
expanded how many faucets 
or sites where water comes out 
that we’re testing.”

According to a statement by 

AAPS Superintendent Jeanice 
Swift on the district’s website, 
the district will implement 
protocol when lead levels in 
schools exceed 10 parts per 
billion.

“With the overall goal of the 

program to reduce exposure 
to lead, in this next round of 
testing we are also lowering 
the threshold for when we 
implement the AAPS protocol 
for addressing an issue,” the 
statement 
reads. 
“Starting 

this fall, remediation efforts 
will be implemented when 
lead levels are at >10 ppb. 
Additional attention will be 
paid to water fixtures that are 
between 5 and 10 ppb.”

Nriagu said the state of 

Michigan has changed testing 
requirements for lead and 
these are more accurate in 
determining lead levels in 
water.

“What 
they 
(the 
state) 

recommend now is they should 
collect the first 250 milliliters 
of water and then the (fifth) 
liter of water,” Nriagu said. 
“Whichever one is higher (in 
lead content) is what they 
should use to determine what 
to do next.”

Area 
residents 
are 
also 

concerned with perfluoroalkyl 
and 
polyfluoroalkyl 

substances, known as PFAS, 
in the Huron River. The river 
serves as a main water source 
for the city.

be really powerful to have 
organizations that are leaders 
in their communities all in one 
room to celebrate different 
cultures, 
different 
food, 

different music.”

In 
April, 
along 
with 

PILOT, 
an 
organization 

for 
underrepresented 
and 

first-generation 
students, 

La Casa hosted its first joint 
cultural 
event 
with 
the 

Arab 
Student 
Association, 

providing their own unique 
cultural 
perspectives 
for 

prospective students visiting 
the University. Public Policy 

junior 
Arwa 
Gayar, 
the 

director of community action 
for ASA, said the bond formed 
between the two organizations 
at that event was the impetus 
for 
“Cultural 
Crossroads,” 

which grew to include the 
Muslim Students’ Association 
and United Asian American 
Organizations.

“Ever since (the La Casa and 

ASA event), our communities 
have been really comfortable 
together and we’ve been able to 
do a lot,” Gayar said. “They’ve 
been really good allies for us. 
This year we were like, ‘This 
is such a great relationship we 
have, and we need to expand it 
with other organizations and 
cultural groups on campus.’”

Previous 
collaborative 

events 
between 
student 

cultural 
organizations 
only 

involved two different groups, 
Sandoval said, and La Casa saw 
an opportunity for something 
bigger.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Taha Shaukat, outreach chair 
for MSA, said the food –– which 
included fried plantains with 
cream, 
samosas, 
Moroccan 

puff pastry and vegetarian 
spring rolls –– was one of the 
hardest parts of the event to 
organize, but still an essential 
piece.

“We had to figure out food 

–– ‘What’s something that’ll 
entice people into coming?’ 
And obviously, we’re college 

kids, free food is always the 
way to go, so finding people 
to actually go out and get 
food, figuring out a budget 
for the food, all that kind of 
stuff was really important, 
and it was hard, I’ll tell you 
that 
right 
now,” 
Shaukat 

said. “The Muslim Student 
Association, it’s kind of like 
an umbrella group, and there’s 
so many different ethnicities 
underneath, so you can’t really 
have one single food for it, so we 
kind of let (the Arab Students 
Association) run that kind of 
stuff for us, because their food 
is really good anyway.” 

LSA 
junior 
Dim 
Mang, 

co-external chair for UAAO, 
agreed 
solidarity 
was 
an 

important 
function 
of 
the 

event, saying students of color 
often become isolated within 
their own communities.

“I would hope that after 

this event, people come out 
to 
support 
other 
people’s 

organizations because I think 
if you’re a part of a community 
–– for me, I do go to a lot of 
A/PIA community events but 
then I don’t attend a lot of other 
events in the Arab community, 
or Latinx community,” Mang 
said. “After this, I hope that 
people go and seek those events 
and make some friends.”

addressing the trauma of the 
past week.

“It’s been an emotional, 

difficult, and in many ways 
traumatizing week,” Briggs 
wrote in an email. “This 
underscores 
the 
need 
for 

the community (Ann Arbor 
and 
the 
University) 
to 

come together to show our 
emotional support for each 
other and to organize. We’re 
proud that the event connected 
community 
members 
to 

supportive 
resources, 
such 

as SAPAC (Sexual Assault 
and 
Prevention 
Awareness 

Center), 
and 
to 
multiple 

organizations 
that 
provide 

ways to protest and resist.”

As 
a 
survivor, 
LSA 

sophomore Morgan McCaul 
said 
this 
has 
been 
an 

immensely challenging time. 
She spoke to the crowd at 
Thursday’s 
rally, 
stressing 

the importance of believing 

survivors 
such 
as 
Ford, 

Deborah 
Ramirez, 
Julie 

Swetnick 
and 
Anita 
Hill. 

McCaul has been an outspoken 
advocate for survivors’ rights 
since her powerful impact 
statement at Larry Nassar’s 
trial in January. 

“We live in a world that 

systematically 
oppresses 

victims who speak up, and 
we have a responsibility to 
change that,” McCaul said. “It 
is time to end victim shaming. 
It is time to uplift survivors’ 
voices. It is time to start by 
believing.”

McCaul 
was 
followed 

by Krystle Rose DuPree, a 
veteran and sexual assault 
survivor.

“We are the backbone that 

can’t be broken,” DuPree said. 
“The sound that shall not be 
silenced. We have survived 
and we are empowered. Our 
black bodies matter and the 
amount of someone’s bank 
account does not determine 
their worth.”

Alethea 
Phillips, 
an 

indigenous peoples activist, 

built upon DuPree’s discussion 
of race and assault, speaking 
on the varying ways sexual 
violence 
manifests 
itself 

in 
different 
communities. 

Phillips is a member of the 
Omaha Tribe of Nebraska and 
an advocate for missing and 
murdered indigenous women. 
One in three Native American 
women is sexually assaulted in 
their lifetime — the highest of 
any ethnic group in the United 
States.

“I 
want 
you 
all 
to 

understand that when we 
talk 
about 
survivors, 
we 

mean to talk about survivors 
everywhere,” Phillips said.

Ypsilanti Township Trustee 

Monica 
Ross-Williams 
and 

LSA sophomore Dylan Gilbert 
were also featured speakers. 
Gilbert, 
an 
award-winning 

slam poet, shared some of her 
work with the crowded.

Heidi 
Sproull, 
an 
area 

psychotherapist, educator and 
survivor, closed out the rally 
breaking two wooden blocks 
with the words “Kavanaugh 
Nomination,” written across 

them.In 
Washington, 
D.C., 

protesters 
were 
arrested 

Thursday 
afternoon 
for 

occupying the Hart Senate 
Office Building. Ann Arbor 
organizers 
instructed 

marchers to remain peaceful 
following the route outlined 
by event leaders.

Marchers 
took 
to 
the 

sidewalk 
of 
State 
Street, 

chanting in unison, “What do 
we want? Respect. When do 
we want it? Now!”

As the group made their 

way back to the Diag, LSA 
sophomore 
Anna 
Tropiano 

and Engineering sophomore 
Emily Bachwich took to the 
steps 
of 
Harlan 
Hatcher 

Graduate 
Library 
standing 

arm-in-arm.

Tropiano said she has run 

into men on campus who 
think Kavanaugh’s academic 
achieves make him worthy of 
“a pass.”

“I came here today to show 

my support for Dr. Ford and 
for all survivors and to show 
that empathy toward them 
should be our first instinct 

rather than worrying about a 
man’s reputation,” Tropiano 
said.

Engineering 
freshman 

Lucas Crumb and Eastern 
Michigan sophomore Hunter 
Mellinger came to the rally 
to stand in solidarity with 
women and survivors.

“I think it’s important for 

everyone to stand for women’s 
rights, no matter if you’re 
a man, woman or other,” 
Mellinger said. “This is an 
important cause that needs to 
recognized.”

The full Senate is voting 

on a procedural motion on 
Kavanaugh’s 
nomination 

Friday morning. According to 
organizers, this rally served 
a moment to come together 
before Friday’s events.

“Tonight was a symbolic act 

of solidarity for Dr. Ford and 
survivors of all walks of life; 
I was honored to participate 
and grateful to the Women’s 
March and Progressives at 
Michigan for making space for 
our stories,” McCaul said. 

more than you ever could in 
words.”

Snapchat was created in 

2011 by CEO Evan Spiegel 
along 
with 
Reggie 
Brown 

and 
Bobby 
Murphy, 
and 

is 
now 
worth 
$2 
billion. 

Adweek named Snapchat as the 
fastest growing social media 
platform out of the big four 
networks in 2015 and a June 
study found the app has 188 
million users.

He graduated from LSA with 

a degree in Art History and 
interned at Apple during his 
summers. Horowitz joined the 
Snapchat team in 2015 after 
working at Motorola, Apple, 
Microsoft and Google, among 
others. 
Horowitz 
stressed 

the importance of passion in 
addition to a course of study.

“I would still argue that your 

Michigan degree is the most 
valuable thing you’ll have and 
will set you apart for sure,” 
Horowitz said. “But it’s also 
going to put you at the top 
of the stack, but it’s still not 
necessarily the thing that will 
put you over the top. If you have, 
or find your passion, pursue it, 
do it. Find something that you 
love to do. Find something that 
is fun. Don’t do it just to find a 
job, find something you enjoy 
doing.”

Since he came on board, 

Snapchat has made advances 
in 
body 
tracking, 
sky 

segmentation, 
real-time 
sky 

segmentation, 
contextual 

sequences and facial mapping. 
Horowitz said Snapchat will 
continue to work on these 
features to make the user 
experience better and change 
how cameras are used.

LSA 
sophomore 
Aisling 

O’Donnell said she enjoyed 
Horowitz’s 
description 
of 

augmented 
reality 
and 
his 

take on Snapchat’s place in the 
world.

“It was interesting to learn 

from the perspective of Steve 
Horowitz and a big company 
that I use, like Snapchat, all the 
time,” O’Donnell said. “I really 
enjoyed how he went through 
his backstory and his history 
and described the future of 
Snapchat as well as his future 
ideas for the world.”

Horowitz said the evolution 

of 
technology 
will 
always 

happen, and in his experience 
with Android, he believes this 
constant 
change 
can 
push 

companies 
to 
make 
better 

products. From the first camera 
to the current era of Snapchat 
and the localization of content 
such as weather, location and 
music, Horowitz said he sees 
a potential to change how 
humans interact with each 
other, 
technology 
and 
the 

world.

“For better or worse — I’d 

like to think better — we are in 
an era where technology allows 
the transformation of the world 
around us,” Horowitz said. 
“And I think the more we sort 
of adapt and focus on using 
that for good, the better it will 
be for society. I think if we are 
afraid of it, we are not going to 
be as well off. Everyone in the 
industry has a duty to and has 
a responsibility to use it for 
good.”

Lily 
Wang, 
School 
of 

Information 
development 

associate and member of the 
development 
and 
alumni 

relations team, said the goal 
in choosing a speaker is to 
find someone who would be 
interesting to both students and 
alumni and would be interested 
in coming to campus.

Wang said data science is 

one of the most popular fields 
in the School of Information. 
This includes studying human-
computer 
interaction 
and 

augmented 
reality, 
which 

Wang said made Horowitz an 
appealing guest.

“It’s kind of a mix of seeing 

who would be interesting — the 
fields that they study — as well 
as how interested they are in 
coming,” Wang said. “Someone 
like Steve Horowitz, who works 
on Snapchat hardware, is really 
enticing to both alumni and 
current students.”

“S

tates are where all the 
action 
in 
domestic 
policymaking 
is.” 
This is what I learned 
from Jenna Bednar, a 
University of Michigan 
political 
science 
professor and specialist 
on federalism, when 
I sat down with her 
this week. We agreed 
that 
state 
elections 
are 
extraordinarily 
important 
and 
are 
often underrepresented 
in our country. Much 
of our country’s policy either 
originates from or is informed by 
state and local policies. As Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Louis 
Brandeis 
wrote in his dissent in New State 
Ice Co. v. Liebmann, “it is one of 
the happy incidents of the federal 
system, that a single courageous 
state may, if its citizens choose, 
serve as a laboratory; and try novel 
social and economic experiments 
without risk to the rest of the 
country.” 
TV 
comedian 
John 
Oliver, in a 2014 episode, cited that 
Congress passed 185 laws in that 
session. State legislatures, in the 
same time frame, passed more than 
24,000. But why are state elections 
underrepresented if that is where 
most domestic policy comes from? 
Is there a certain group to blame?
Some might jump to blaming 
the media, and they would have 
a few fair points. We learn in our 
government classes in high school 
that elections are covered “like 
horse races.” It’s fun and exciting 
to track polling numbers up to 
election day, so that’s what the 
media often focuses on. It also 
makes sense for the national news 
media to focus on national news 
and elections, leaving states to 
fall by the wayside. Why should a 
person watching CNN in Florida 
care about Massachusetts’s state 
legislature election? Between 2003 
and 2012, the newspaper workforce 
dropped 30 percent, including 
a significant cutback in those 
covering local and state politics for 
both local and national news. This 
has had several effects, including 
candidates less engaged with local 

news, along with those candidates 
relying on TV ads to get their 
messages out instead of interacting 
with the media.
Maybe the political 
parties are at fault. 
Another 
thing 
we 
learn in government is 
that the job of political 
parties is to get people 
elected. These parties 
do a great job of raising 
money and spending 
that money, but where? 
If 
you 
watch 
TV, 
you’ve almost certainly 
seen ads this election season for 
Senate and gubernatorial races. 
What about the state House of 
Representatives or state Senate? 
Follow the money. More than $2 
billion was spent on the presidential 
race in 2016 and $4 billion was 
spent on all of the congressional 
races combined.
Perhaps it is just the nature 
of the local and state offices that 
doesn’t attract this attention. One 
point Bednar made was that at 
lower levels of government there 
is a higher likelihood of deviation 
from party doctrines. If these 
government officials are less likely 
to follow strict party lines, then it 
follows that parties would invest 
less money because they stand to 
get less in return.
It’d be easy to place the blame 
here on one single entity and move 
on, but an issue like this isn’t that 
simple. There’s plenty of blame to go 
around and some of that rightly falls 
on us. What was the last state issue 
you heard about? In Michigan, for 
many, it is probably the Flint water 
crisis. In this “information age” we 
have unprecedented access to so 
much information, but often we are 
only willing to take in so little. We 
stick to one cable news show or we 
have our favorite newspaper.
Election turnout is typically 
around 60 percent for presidential 
elections, but only 40 percent 
for midterms. It is even lower 
for primary, local and off-year 
elections. For example, in Dallas, 
only 6.1 percent of eligible voters 
participated 
in 
the 
mayoral 
election in May 2015. Turnout 

is less than 20 percent for 15 of 
the 30 most populous cities in 
the country in mayoral elections. 
Even in gubernatorial election 
years, turnout is low. In every 
gubernatorial election year since 
1970, except for 2006, turnout was 
below 50 percent in Michigan. Most 
of the time the majority of people 
don’t vote if it isn’t a presidential 
election year. Generally speaking, 
in only one year out of every 
four does more than half of the 
electorate make their way to a 
ballot box.
Over the past few weeks, many 
of my professors have encouraged 
students to register by the Oct. 9 
deadline. One of these professors 
told us that her opinion is that 
“if you don’t vote, you don’t get 
to complain.” I would go further. 
If you don’t cast an informed 
vote, then you should not feel 
comfortable commenting at all. 
Take a minute to research the 
candidates on every level. You 
should know who is running for 
office in your community and have 
a general idea what they believe in, 
beyond the “R” or “D” next to their 
name. My father, for example, gets 
an absentee ballot, so he can sit at 
home with his laptop and research 
each candidate’s platform online as 
he fills in the bubbles.
We could blame the media, 
or political parties, or candidates, 
or some idea that our votes don’t 
matter, for why people can’t find 
their way to the ballot box and 
why many don’t have a strong 
grasp of the politics of their local 
community. I’d rather take the 
blame and the responsibility on 
myself to get informed and to do 
my part in deciding the future of 
this country. It’s just as easy to lie 
to yourself and say you’ll put effort 
into getting informed as it is to tell 
yourself that you’re going to start 
going to the gym. However, we 
have more to lose in our elections 
if we don’t get informed than we do 
if we skip the gym a few times, so 
please, find the ballot box but only 
after doing some research.

Can disaffiliated Greek life save itself?
A

s the fall 2018 Greek life 
rush 
continues 
across 
campus, 
disaffiliated 
fraternities and their relationships 
with 
incoming 
students 
are 
left in an uncertain purgatory. 
Fraternities officially affiliated with 
the University of Michigan operate 
under a well-defined framework 
of rules. They’re geared to further 
focus on charitable work, inclusion 
and academic performance. Even 
the signing of bids for students 
chosen fraternities is administered 
through Interfraternity Council 
personnel. Recently, however, six 
fraternities (some of which with 
strong national charters and a 
large student base) have chosen 
to divorce themselves from the 
University and its IFC regulations. 
This 
separation 
raises 
more 
questions than it answers. How 
will these disaffiliated fraternities 
continue 
to 
operate 
in 
the 
University’s social ecosystem? How 
will students perceive this new 
type of underground fraternity? 
And how will these disaffiliated 
fraternities impact the University’s 
Greek life that is already under siege 
for hazing, alcohol-related harm 
and sexual misconduct incidents? 
The answers to these questions 
might be within the fraternities 
themselves.
Colleges 
and 
universities 
across the United States have 
recently been grappling with how 
to regulate Greek life in the wake 
of a series of incidents. U.S. News 
and World Report has reported 
that American campuses have 
experienced at least one student 
death by hazing every year since 
1959. Universities are meant to be 
crucibles of knowledge and self-
exploration, not pitfalls where 
students are sent into potentially 
life-threatening situations. The 
University of Michigan, with its 
tradition of solving complex social 
and 
organizational 
problems 
since its founding in 1817, and as 
a university with one of the oldest 
and richest Greek communities in 
the country, must take a national 
leadership role in forging a 
lasting and workable solution to 
this problem. It is important to 
note that fraternities, just like 
the students that compose the 
memberships, are individual and 

widely 
varying. 
Disaffiliating 
so-called “bad actor” fraternities 
under this “eviction” system only 
treats the symptoms and not the 
root causes of isolated, erratic 
behavior, and may exacerbate 
the dangerous situations. And 
the prospect of creating a new, 
disaffiliated 
category 
of 
off-
campus housing could cultivate 
a “Wild West” dynamic and 
compound 
the 
issues 
the 
University seeks to control.
The University boasts some 
of the brightest minds in the 
world, which should be called 
to action to craft a solution that 
involves input from fraternity and 
sorority 
leadership, 
university 
administration 
and 
functional 
academics. 
Instituting 
rules 
designed to “bring the frats into 
compliance,” for instance, new 
zoning ordinances that shackle 
fraternities to policy without 
due 
process, 
will 
result 
in 
rebellion, witnessed by the recent 
disaffiliations of six fraternities 
due to a zoning code restriction 
passed by the Ann Arbor City 
Council 
this 
summer. 
Surely 
there is a solution that doesn’t 
“evict” fraternities, but instead 
empowers them to self-regulate 
within a system that challenges 
them to meet the standards of 
the community. This would allow 
them to operate and manage 
themselves appropriately, while 
still proving to the University’s 
community that they are a force of 
good. They could meet challenges 
of financial performance (houses 
remain solvent and self-paying), 
academic 
performance 
and 
volunteering and charitable work. 
Under this proposal, the IFC 
would function less as university 
adults imposing arbitrary rules 
and more as an apparatus working 
more closely with the fraternities 
to better manage their houses, 
their safety and their success. 
Not 
only 
would 
this 
allow 
the fraternities to have more 
accountability, but it also might 
enliven chapters to run with 
their new personal responsibility. 
Greek rushing is up 45 percent at 
universities around the country 
since 2006, and a system like this 
at the University could pave the 
way for self-regulated fraternities 

across the United States.
But why do we have Greek 
life anyway? It’s flawed at its core 
and we should just ban the whole 
thing, some will argue. Greek 
life at the University constitutes 
22 percent of the undergraduate 
student 
population 
(that’s 
more than 6,200 students) and 
generates 
millions 
of 
dollars 
annually for the Ann Arbor 
economy. The chapters hire cooks, 
cleaners, sanitation workers and 
repairmen 
to 
maintain 
their 
houses, buy bulk food and provide 
amenities 
for 
the 
residential 
students. 
Fraternities 
and 
sororities, social and otherwise, 
are woven into the fabric of the 
university’s social, academic and 
charitable life. Furthermore, these 
Greek life organizations have 
connections all throughout the 
private business sector and even 
the political sphere. U.S. News 
and World Report reports that 44 
percent of the U.S. presidents, 35 
members of the U.S. Senate, and 
60 members of the U.S. House 
have held fraternity memberships. 
Furthermore, in the past year, 
the 
Interfraternity 
Council 
grade point average was higher 
than the all-male average for 
University students, underscoring 
that Greek life membership and 
academic performance are not 
mutually exclusive. A solution to 
the disaffiliated fraternity issue 
must recognize that Greek life 
is an overwhelmingly positive 
force at the University, offering 
relationships, 
housing, 
social 
experiences 
and 
networking 
for thousands of students each 
year. Hazing and underage 
binge drinking are exceptions to 
the rule, and the University and 
local law enforcement must be 
uncompromising in attending to 
these situations. Working from 
the excellent, albeit imperfect 
framework and organization of 
the existing IFC, the University 
must challenge and empower 
fraternity and sorority leadership 
to collaborate on policies, rules 
and procedures designed to better 
police themselves.

O

n 
Tuesday 
afternoon, 
President Donald Trump 
expressed his sympathy 
for 
young 
men 
in 
America while speaking 
to reporters outside the 
White House. In his 
words: “It is a very scary 
time for young men in 
America, where you can 
be guilty of something 
you may not be guilty 
of.” His view represents 
a wider concern among 
some 
conservative 
Americans in light of the 
accusations against Supreme Court 
nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the 
#MeToo movement at large. They 
are concerned with due process 
and fear the rights of the accused 
are being undermined in cases 
of sexual assault. However, these 
worries are largely unfounded, as 
study after study has confirmed 
that false accusations are incredibly 
uncommon. Thus, this line of 
backlash was predictable coming 
from Trump. He concluded his 
statements with a starkly less 
familiar sentiment; when asked if he 
had any words for young American 
women, he responded, “Women are 
doing great.”
Maybe all of the women around 
me and I are anomalies, but it does 
not quite seem that women are 
doing great. On the contrary, the 
Kavanaugh hearings have brought 
back memories of sexual trauma 
for many victims, who are mostly 
women. I did not plan on writing 
about Kavanaugh (again) this week. I 
had hoped my column this semester 
would be centered around a topic of 
pure intellectual curiosity and not 
my own experiences with gender-

based violence and sexual trauma. 
Unfortunately, I have not gone an 
hour — waking or sleeping — since 
last Thursday morning 
without reliving those 
experiences. 
Last 
Thursday 
morning 
is 
when 
Stanford 
University psychologist 
Christine Blasey Ford 
sat in front of the Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee 
to provide testimony 
about her assault at 
the hands of Brett 
Kavanaugh.
I had a class with a no-screen 
policy for the first hour of the 
hearings, so I sat in blissful 
ignorance of the texts flying into 
my phone about the heartbreak that 
each of my loved ones felt watching 
Ford speak. Then I watched the 
committee question her throughout 
my stats lecture, with the screen 
split on my laptop between notes 
and C-SPAN. I expected to feel 
empathy for her — I was too a victim 
of sexual assault and I feel quite 
strongly about keeping abusers 
away from power. I did not expect 
to leave the lecture hall in a panic, 
heart pounding and tears forming. 
I had forgotten what a panic attack 
felt like. It had been a year or so since 
I experienced one. But I sat on some 
concrete ledge outside the Modern 
Languages 
Building 
and 
that 
once familiar feeling of tightness 
in the chest, shortness of breath 
and desperate desire to escape 
overwhelmed me. I could only 
think, “I was 15 too,” and about how 
infantile my 15-year-old self seems 
now. Ford’s testimony forced me to 
relive that experience in a new way. 
Yes — I’d thought about my assaults, 

I’d written about them, assessed 
them, but it was always from a 
numbed distance provided by the 
passed time. I had dealt with those 
experiences more as an onlooker. 
But her words broke through that 
numbness, and as she described the 
night from her own point of view, 
I became able to access my own 
younger self’s point of view. 
My friends expressed similar 
accounts of watching the hearings 
— that they were surprised by their 
own reactions. It led one friend 
to stay away from campus all day 
due to anxiety, and another friend 
to come to terms with her own 
experience — admitting to herself 
that she too had been assaulted. A 
close friend revealed how similar 
Kavanaugh was to her own abuser 
— a privileged, white, private school 
boy. My friends and I were not an 
anomaly, though. Rape, Incest and 
Abuse National Network had its 
busiest day on record last Thursday. 
Survivors across the country were 
shaken by Ford’s tragedy, and by 
Kavanaugh’s vehement denial of it. 
Watching her brokenness so clearly 
juxtaposed with his indignant rage 
was simply too close to home.
So, on Thursday, and in the days 
to follow, American women have 
not been gloating in our vengeful 
attempted takedown of a powerful 
man. We have been mourning 
for Ford, both now and at age 15, 
for each other and for ourselves. 
Once again, we have been forced 
to wring out our trauma in the 
public sphere in a hopeless effort to 
stop our political institutions from 
further demise.

s is often the case with these 
things, the 73rd session of 
the United Nations General 
Assembly raised more questions 
than answers. The two weeks were 
jam-packed with the events therein, 
churning out headline after headline. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu embarrassed himself by 
way of his shameless hypocrisy and 
lies about Iran’s nonexistent “atomic 
warehouse.” Somali Foreign Minister 
Ahmed Awad Isse gave a powerful 
speech informing the assembly of the 
huge strides his country has taken on 
the path towards stability.
I could go on and on. The 
developments were plenty and to go 
through all of them would be, to put 
it simply, excessive. Rather, I would 
like to focus on what transpired 
during the course of the two weeks 
specifically in regard to United States-
Venezuela relations and what should 
be done going forward.
On Sept. 26, Nicolas Maduro 
shocked the world when, during a 
speech to the General Assembly, he 
stated that he is willing and ready 
to come to the table and meet with 
the Trump administration. Think 
of just how amazing that is. The 
Trump administration has been 
openly mulling the idea of invading 
Venezuela and overthrowing, and 
likely killing, Maduro since at least 
August 2017. While some might say 
he has been backed into a corner, to 
offer to speak with those who plot 
your demise is noteworthy, to say the 
least.
The 
Trump 
administration 
has yet to comment on the offer. To 
decline Maduro’s offer would only 
serve to expose the malevolence of 
their foreign policy even further. By 
all accounts, they are still set on the 
idea of a military intervention in the 

South American nation. What did 
you expect with John “the earlier you 
strike, the more damage you can do” 
Bolton as national security adviser?
Keep in mind the current 
administration is engaged in active 
bombing campaigns of eight different 
countries. They have also expanded 
the war in Afghanistan, which is both 
the longest and most unpopular war 
in American history. Moreover, the 
administration has pursued what 
essentially amounts to a scorched-
earth policy in Iraq and Syria, 
leading to record numbers of civilian 
casualties. All this is just scratching 
the surface as it pertains to the scope 
of their evil.
Nevertheless, as we see with the 
current rhetoric on Venezuela, it is 
clear that the administration is still 
hell-bent on spreading death and 
destruction abroad. When addressing 
anti-Maduro 
protesters 
outside 
the United Nations building, Nikki 
Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United 
Nations, said, “We are not just going 
to let the Maduro regime backed by 
Cuba hurt the Venezuelan people 
anymore.” If she had even one iota of 
honesty to her being, she would have 
concluded that statement by saying 
“now it’s our turn.”
The simple truth is that this 
administration does not care about 
Venezuelan lives. If they did, they 
would not be banging the war drums 
and calling for a coup — a move 
that would unleash untold horrors 
on a country that has already been 
through hell. If they really cared about 
Venezuelan lives, they would lift their 
crippling sanctions regime that has 
done nothing to target corruption but 
only foment instability.
If you want to help, then help. 
Invasion is not the way to do it. 
Attacking the independence of a 

sovereign nation-state is not the 
way to do it. It’s about time we start 
making friends instead of enemies.
This hypocrisy was addressed 
directly by none other than Maduro 
himself. He said, “Donald Trump 
said he was worried about Venezuela, 
he wanted to help Venezuela … I stand 
ready to talk with an open agenda on 
everything that he might wish to 
talk about with the United States of 
America.”
I must be honest, with the cast 
of characters currently running this 
country, prospects for peace do indeed 
look grim. I have little confidence in 
both bureaucrats and elected officials 
to do the right thing simply out of the 
goodness of their hearts. It is up to us — 
the people — to put pressure on them.
And so, I would like to conclude 
this column with a call to action. In the 
1960s and early 1970s, college campuses 
were at the heart of the anti-war 
movement. University students across 
the nation stood up and protested 
against the immoral, unjust Vietnam 
War. The role this played in advancing 
the agenda of eventual disengagement 
cannot be underestimated.
Let those honorable men and 
women be our example. We need 
to rekindle that flame. I want to see 
students once again rise up in a public 
way to protest the horrors of war. As 
patriotic Americans, we cannot allow 
for our so-called leaders to drag us into 
another foreign conflict.
I say all of this with a tremendous 
amount of urgency. We must do 
something fast. And what better 
place to start than the University of 
Michigan, home of the leaders and 
the best? Organize!

No war in Venezuela

Who would have thought 
the mousy blond boy in “Dead 
Poets Society” would go on to 
have a multifaceted, successful 
career? 
After 
proving 
his 
caliber in the acting realm, 
Ethan 
Hawke 
has 
moved 
on to writing and directing. 
“Blaze,” 
his 
latest 
writer-
director 
project, 
showcases 
an astounding command of 
language, music and film.
“Blaze” 
follows 
the 
short-lived 
but 
passionate 
relationship between forgotten 
singer-songwriter 
Michael 
David Fuller (Ben Dickey) — 
stage name Blaze Foley — and 
his ex-wife Sybil Rosen (Alia 
Shawkat, “The Intervention”). 
As Foley strove to create a 
legacy, he cast aside the love 
of his life and descended into a 
state of loneliness, even as his 
following of admirers grew. 
Foley’s alcoholism and general 
self-destructive 
behavior 
allowed 
an 
unmatched 
rawness to seep into his music, 
ultimately 
leading 
to 
his 
downfall.
Few 
musical 
movies 
accomplish what Hawke crafts 
in “Blaze”: a symbiosis between 
soundtrack and image. Often, 
in other attempts, the music 
takes over, turning the film 
into an extended music video. 
Or, the film overpowers a score 
that lacks, simply put, good 

music. In “Blaze,” though, the 
music and the filmic elements 
are both stars and neither fade 
to the background.
“Blaze” 
hops 
between 
a 
radio show discussing Foley’s 
legacy, a recreation of Foley’s 

final performance and snippets 
of his relationship with Rosen. 
Rosen’s book “Living in the 
Woods in a Tree: Remembering 
Blaze” and co-writer credit on 
the film lends authority and 
intimacy to the story. Her and 
Hawke’s screenplay reads like 
a constant flow of poetic lyrics 
with countless moments that 
induce snaps of appreciation.
The 
scenes 
are 
choreographed 
with 
breathtaking 
precision 
and 
a whimsical wandering that 
keeps the story human and 
not 
the 
larger-than-life, 
unrealistic 
dream-reaching 
narrative of other musical 
movies. Montages of Foley 
and Rosen’s time in the woods 
display the deep connection 
the two shared, which makes 
their parting from one another 
all the more tragic.
Despite the beautiful and 
structured 
shots, 
Hawke’s 
overall 
style 
verges 
on 
a 
documentary. He pans over 

the indifferent faces of the 
audience at the bar, unaware 
they are witnessing the final 
hours of Blaze Foley’s life. They 
are oblivious of the genius 
before them. The detached 
directing plays off the stripped 
and tender songs with potent 
results. 
The 
casting 
decision 
to 
use real musicians who can 
act, rather than teach actors 
how to be musicians, allows 
the soundtrack to work its 
magic: with authenticity and 
no distractions. Dickey and 
Charlie Sexton (“Boyhood”), 
in the role of friend and fellow 
songwriting 
icon 
Townes 
Van Zandt, as well as Kris 
Kristofferson 
(“A 
Star 
is 
Born”) don’t have to fake play 
the guitar or lip sync. Sexton 
has performed with Bob Dylan, 
Kristofferson was a member of 
The Highwaymen with Waylon 
Jennings, Willie Nelson and 
Johnny Cash and Dickey has 
his own album. Together, they 
provide convincing and moving 
renditions of folk music that 
defined an era. 
Hawke could have chosen 
celebrity, trained actors for the 
main roles (as the cameos from 
award-winners Sam Rockwell, 
Richard Linklater and Hawke 
himself 
show), 
but 
using 
actual 
musicians 
reinforces 
the poetry and realness of the 
film. His instincts result in a 
profound and sensational film 
in “Blaze,” confirming Hawke 
as a triple threat.

Loretta Lynn remains the 
queen of classic country 

After 
a 
nearly 
yearlong 
setback from a stroke, Loretta 
Lynn released her latest album, 
Wouldn’t 
It 
Be 
Great, 
this 
past Friday, Sept. 28th; It was 
everything a Lynn fan could hope 
for, and more. The album features 
13 songs, with a welcome mix of 
new material, like the title track 
and “Ruby’s Stool,” and updated 
classics, like her hallmark “Coal 
Miner’s Daughter” and “Don’t 
Come Home a’ Drinkin’.” Those 
who are diehard, old-fashioned 
classic country fans can rest 
assured that Lynn compromises 
none of her usual flair and style in 
her latest release, preserving both 
her own musical integrity and the 
history and culture of the classic 
country genre as a whole.
A 
master 
of 
her 
craft, 
Lynn’s album is like a warm 
welcome home, never losing 
the 
characteristic 
twang 
or 
no-nonsense 
candor 
of 
the 
genre. Yet while every song has 
a distinctive sense of familiarity, 
from Lynn’s usual sass in “Ruby 
Stool” to the lonesome cry of 
“I’m Dying for Someone to Live 
For,” the material never feels 
lazy or reused. Rising to stardom 
much later in life — already a 
wife and mother by the time 
she was a household name — 
Lynn broke barriers by writing 
songs about her experiences as 
a housewife. Her blunt honesty 
and oddly matched innocence 
made her songs stand out in a 
genre dominated by the same 
rough-and-tough men she sang 
of in her music. Lynn touched 
upon everything from her marital 
conflicts with her husband, Oliver 
“Doo” Lynn, in songs such as 
“Don’t Come Home a’ Drinkin’,” 
to showing her feisty personality 
and the feminine perspective, 
in songs like “You Ain’t Woman 
Enough.”
Once 
again, 
Lynn’s 
songs 
hit home in her new album. 

Lynn’s opening song “Wouldn’t 
it be Great” is almost chilling, 
the 
repetition 
of 
the 
lyrics 
emphasizing the underlying sense 
of bitterness and loss as Lynn 
laments love lost to vice. Lynn’s 
inspiration came primarily from 
her own life and relationships — 
an acknowledgement that makes 
her song even more cutting. Lines 
such as: “The bottle took my place, 
love went to waste” transcend 
beyond the genre and the artist, 

and prove to be a stark reminder of 
how the intimacy of Lynn’s music 
captures the hearts and minds 
of millions. “Ruby Stool” brings 
some relief as Lynn is pitted 
against a troublesome young rival, 
and defiantly decides to put her 
in her place by “sittin’ on Ruby’s 
stool” — a song reminiscent of 
her classic “You Ain’t Woman 
Enough.” Finally, “Darkest Day,” 
“The Big Man” and “These Old 
Blues” harken to the heyday of 
classic country, reminiscent of 
both Lynn’s earlier career hits and 
those of her contemporaries.
Lynn branches out stylistically 
with songs like “God Makes No 
Mistakes,” where her age and 
experience are more tangible 
in her somber reflection on the 
cruelties of life in reconciliation 
with her faith. “Ain’t No Time To 
Go” similarly displays a heavier, 
more weary tone in its intro 
and subject matter, addressing 
the idea of losing a partner or 
loved one and having to live 
on without them — a possible 
reference to the death of Lynn’s 
first husband, whom she had 
been married to since she was 13 
years old. These songs strike a 
strong contrast to feisty numbers 
like “Ruby’s Stool” and previous 
hits like “Honky Tonk Girl” — 
both of which capitalized on 
Lynn’s image as a spirited young 

woman. While Lynn doesn’t show 
any hint of slowing down, these 
songs convey a distinct change in 
style brought on by her long life 
and advancing age. Much of her 
album focuses on central themes 
of loss and running out of time, 
with some songs in her album 
reminiscent of the legendary 
Johnny Cash’s later recording 
sessions. However, Lynn avoids 
the bone-weary attitude of Cash 
in her album, instead matching 
her powerful voice with the sense 
of self-reflection that comes from 
experience.
The album ends with Lynn’s 
crowd-pleasers 
“Don’t 
Come 
Home a’ Drinkin’” and “Coal 
Miner’s Daughter.” Lynn shows 
that 
despite 
the 
years 
that 
have past, she’s never lost her 
touch. Her revamp of “Coal 
Miner’s Daughter” stays true 
to the original, with a slightly 
brighter tune from a busier 
instrumentation — a change 
which adds a subtle touch of 
modernity without losing the true 
spirit of the song. Often referred 
to simply as The Coal Miner’s 
Daughter, the album’s finale is a 
testament to Lynn’s career, and 
reminds the world that Loretta 
Lynn isn’t going anywhere just 
yet. As Lynn sings “Well a lot of 
things have changed since way-
back-when” it feels as if she has 
come full-circle, a reflection 
on her career, which spanned 
decades, and going back even 
farther to the young girl from 
Butcher’s Hollow who had never 
dreamed of such stardom. Just as 
Lynn wrote herself, “It’s so good 
to be back home again,” her album 
certainly feels like a homecoming. 
But, 
more 
importantly, 
the 
survival of Lynn’s career into the 
21st century can also be seen as a 
beacon of hope — a rallying point 
— for the struggling working class 
of Coal Country, U.S.A. While this 
Coal Miner’s Daughter stands 
loud and proud, so too can the 
communities of rural Appalachia 
retain their own pride and dignity 
in an era that wishes to forget 
them.

What ‘The Book Thief’ 
taught me about death

Jul. 2009: I’m lying in the 
scratchy sheets of a hotel bed 
in the Grand Oasis, Cancun, 
Mexico. It’s past midnight, too 
late for a 10-year-old girl to be 
awake. I can hear the rustling 
leaves of the palm trees along 
the ocean shore, yells of spring-
breakers 
running 
through 
the sand and the breathing 
of my mother sleeping beside 
me. But I don’t listen to them, 
really. My world is consumed 
by the book I hold in front of 
me, staring back with its dark 
brown cover of destruction 
and harsh black lines scrawled 
on top of the chaos. They read, 
“The Book Thief.”
I’m not sure who told me to 
read the “The Book Thief” as a 
fifth-grader with frizzy black 
hair tied into a messy ponytail, 
who had lost all her baby teeth 
and confidently labeled herself 
as a bookworm but knew 
nothing about death. And very 
little about Nazi Germany, 
for that matter. Regardless, 
here I was on a fun family 
vacation crying my heart out 
after frantically flipping over 
the last page of the novel and 
realizing that the ending was 
just as painful as I had dreaded.
For those unfamiliar with 
the novel, “The Book Thief” 
follows the story of nine-year-
old Liesel Meminger, an orphan 
taken in by a German couple, 
Hans and Rosa Hubermann, 
during the height of Hitler’s 
reign. Traumatized by the 
death of her younger brother 
and shocked at the state of 

the country, Liesel turns to 
reading. Stealing books from 
the mayor’s library becomes 
a ritual undertaken with her 
partner-in-crime Rudy Steiner, 
who falls in love with Leisel 
within days of meeting her.
Reading 
is 
Liesel’s 
everything: 
her 
joy, 
her 
sadness, her escape from the 
crumbling world around her. 
Crouched in a shelter, Liesel 
reads to her neighborhood 
while the bombs fall around 
them. When Liesel’s foster 
family safeguards Max, a Jew, 
in their basement for years, 
Liesel reads to him. Every time 
I closed my eyes and thought of 
Liesel, I saw myself. We were 
the same age. Had the same 
curiosity 
about 
the 
world. 
Wanted everything to be fair 
and grew frustrated when 
it wasn’t. But Liesel would 
experience death. Real, heart 
wrenching death. My only 
concern at the time was how I 
looked in the neon purple one-
piece swimsuit I had bought 
the week before, and why my 
parents didn’t let me near the 
water bar when everyone else 
was allowed to be there.
Spoiler alert: Everyone in 
“The Book Thief” dies at the 
end. At least, to my 10-year-old 
self, everyone that mattered. 
In fact, the whole novel is 
narrated by Death, who claims 
within the first few pages that 
he will “take us all” in the end. 
He hints that major characters 
like Hans and Rosa will be no 
more by the last page. That 
Rudy will never get a kiss from 
Liesel as long as he lives. But I 
just couldn’t believe it. Death 
was pushed right in front of 
my face, narrating Liesel and 

Rudy’s world, and I wasn’t 
convinced for a second. 
Something 
had 
to 
give 
eventually, and the final straw 
came in the form of Rudy’s 
lifeless body lying on the street 
after the final air raid. Rudy, 
the boy whose biggest ambition 
was to run in the Olympics 
as fast as Jesse Owens, and 
painted his body with black 
paint 
while 
running 
laps 
around the neighborhood track 
one night to prove it. I cried 
for Rudy, Liesel’s other half, 
the childish antics to her calm 
composure. I cried because 
Death had taken Rudy unfairly; 
he was only really a kid; he was 
really just like me.
Oct. 2018: nine years later, 
I’m glad that my inauguration 
to the idea of death happened 
the way it did. Liesel and 
Max, the Jew hidden in the 
basement, 
were 
the 
only 
survivors of the bombing on 
Himmel Street. And let me tell 
you, I woke the hell up. Ever 
since that night at Cancun I’ve 
known that death is sudden, 
never predictable. It can take 
people with whole lives ahead 
of them. Even those that you 
think could never be affected 
by it are.
This isn’t meant to be a 
sob fest. Death is inevitable, 
but also highly stigmatized. 
I would love to see a world 
where death is accepted as a 
necessary tradeoff for living 
a beautiful life. Death can be 
seen warmly as a celebration of 
living, a memoir of the story of 
an individual. Liesel and Rudy 
shared their story with me 
through ink on soft pages. One 
day we’ll all have our stories to 
pass on, too.

FILM REVIEW


Walking into the Javits Center, 
I immediately felt safe. There was 
something oddly comforting about 
this year’s location of RuPaul’s 
DragCon, an annual convention 
that caters toward fans of VH1’s 
award-winning “RuPaul’s Drag 
Race” and general devotees to 
drag culture. Enclosed within 
Javits’s glass walls and industrial 
architecture 
were 
convention-
goers of all ages, abilities, genders, 
sexual orientations, racial and 
ethnic backgrounds, dressed to the 
tens in multicolored attire.
For those familiar with drag icon 
RuPaul’s immensely successful 
reality competition show — or 
for anyone who has participated 
in or watched live drag shows — 
the aesthetic forwardness and 
diverse array of people shouldn’t 
come as a surprise. Both “Drag 
Race” and drag culture are known 
for championing boldness and 
queerness through their emphasis 
on high fashion, self-love and 
extravagant, campy performances.
With its origins dating back 
centuries ago, the drag movement 
has always encouraged people 
within the LGBTQ+ community 
and 
beyond 
to 
challenge 
preconceived notions of gender, 
as well as to express themselves 
regardless of whatever judgment 
may come their way. “RuPaul’s 
Drag Race,” which premiered on 
Logo TV in 2009 and recently 
received 
two 
Emmys 
for 
Outstanding Reality Competition 
Program and Outstanding Reality 
Host, remains an important and 
influential staple in maintaining 
that doctrine by making drag 
more 
accessible 
to 
modern 
audiences. After a record-breaking 
40,000 attendees gathered at last 
year’s DragCon in Los Angeles, 
DragCon’s expansion to New York 
City seemed like the perfect way to 
continue establishing drag’s legacy 
in pop culture. 
On Friday, Sept. 28, day one 
of DragCon, my friend Ariel 
Friedlander — a Stamps junior and 
local Ann Arbor drag queen who 
goes by the stage name Daya Bee-
Dee — and I arrived at the Javits 
Center at exactly 2:00 p.m. As we 
waited to check in for our tickets, 
I noted that almost everyone in 

our line adorned elaborate garbs, 
colorful 
costumes, 
outlandish 
outfits and lavish dresses. Once we 
made our way onto the upper level, 
the atmosphere was welcoming 
and 
unexpectedly 
calm 
for 
such a highly anticipated event, 
though it gradually became more 
overwhelming on day two when 
attendance nearly doubled.
Fortunately, the vastness of 
the Javits Center allowed for easy 
navigation. To help orient people 
through the gaudy spectacle of 
DragCon, the main floor was 
divided into avenues with tongue-
in-cheek street names: 500 Death 
Drop Alley, 600 Backrolls Blvd, 
700 Charisma Court. In the middle 
of the room laid a long, wide pink 
carpet, which operated as both a 
convenient refuge away from the 
controlled chaos and a runway for 
“Drag Race” queens and fans alike 
to serve sickening looks.
Beside the carpet and “Drag 
Race” 
meet-and-greet 
stations 
stood rows of booths that sported 
jewelry, gloves, twunk trunks, 
leather tights, fetish accessories, 
stripper 
poles, 
makeup 
and, 
perhaps most importantly, wigs. 
Classic bops by Britney Spears, 
Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga 
blared from overhead speakers, 
echoing throughout the room. On 
the far left side, a multitude of posts 
featuring artists like NYC-based 
designer, author and personal hero 
of mine Adam J. Kurtz offered a 
selection of queer artwork and 
other knick-knacks to purchase. 
Even the younger attendees had 
their own “Kid’s Zone,” a space 
that consisted of a bouncy house 
and a large green foam mat, where 
children and their parents sat 
and listened to drag queens read 
picture books with messages about 
self-acceptance. This was queer 
heaven if I ever saw one.
Throughout the weekend, the 
convention 
radiated 
relentless 
positivity 
and 
support 
from 
every direction. Walking around 
with Ariel, I couldn’t help but 
notice the frequent rate at which 
compliments — namely “Yas!” 
and “Love your makeup!” and 
“Slay, mama!” — and Instagram 
handles were exchanged between 
ourselves and other DragCon 
attendees. Each convention-goer 
we met were not only friendly, but 
acted as if we were already friends.
The first person we greeted was 

Desmond is Amazing, an adorable, 
up-and-coming child drag star 
who flaunted a patriotic outfit 
with strawberry-colored jellies. 
While waiting in line for season 10 
fan favorite Miz Cracker, we came 
across Miss Sherry Pie, a jubilant 
New York queen dressed in an 
“Alice in Wonderland”-inspired 
get-up. Later on, we met Double 
O Sexy, a flashy drag queen duo 
from Westchester, Pa. comprised 
of Ophelia Hotass and Onyx Black.
“DragCon means a collective 
group 
of 
creative 
individuals 
and inspiring people joining and 
banding together and slaying the 
world,” said Ophelia, who, along 
with Onyx, was dressed as a hybrid 
of a pink-and-yellow Troll doll 
and a zombie with eyelashes as 
flamboyant as Esma’s from “The 
Emperor’s New Groove.” “People 
are coming here and just being 
themselves, being whoever they 
want to be.”
Indeed, 
all 
walks 
of 
life 
seemed to be present at DragCon, 
including a few notable standouts. 
Among the varied streams of regal, 
spooky and silly personalities 
were muscular, scantily clad men 
in assless chaps and neon speedos 
— known on the show as the 
“Pit Crew” — while “Adventure 
Time,” 
“Rugrats,” 
“Clueless,” 
“It” and “The Handmaid’s Tale” 
cosplayers strutted around. Casual 
encounters with popular queens, 
like season 10 winner Aquaria 
and season six contestant Gia 
Gunn, made for pleasant surprises. 
RuPaul 
himself 
remained 
an 
elusive figure during DragCon, 
but as serendipity would have it, 
he strode past us on day three, 
decked out in a pink vest and white 
shirt. A throng of followers tailed 
behind his slender, formidable 
figure, as he carried a sign that said 
#TakeBackTheHouse and waved 
hello to fawning fans basking in his 
glory. 
Even 
with 
the 
non-stop 
promise of fun festivities and 
queer liberation, DragCon wasn’t 
without its faults: Merch was 
expensive, certain vendors were 
overeager, lines to meet “Drag 
Race” contestants were long and 
time-consuming. In one particular 
instance, Ariel and I waited four 
hours to see season seven and 
All-Stars 
season 
two 
favorite 
Katya, whose line extended for 
what seemed like miles but whose 
Red Room-styled station made 
the trip worthwhile. Though 
most of the meet-and-greets 
were free, taking a picture with 
more top-tier queens like Detox 
and All-Stars season 3 winner 
Trixie Mattel required paying a 
ridiculous cost. Even non-“Drag 
Race” contestants like Nikki 
Blonsky, the lead actress from 
“Hairspray,” were trying to make 
a quick buck; an autograph was 
worth $20 and a picture with 
Blonsky was $30.
The 
absurdity 
of 
these 
incentives — and the general 
exhaustion that comes with an 
event as spectacle-heavy and 
pricey as DragCon — was lost on 
neither of us, nor on other drag 
queens present.
“(DragCon) is like a drag 
queen’s 
shopping 
mall. 
It’s 
basically where all get to come 
together,” Onyx said. “It’s like a 
family reunion, but also like, ‘Girl, 
I wanna get this makeup. I need a 
corset. I need some lashes.’ It’s so 
easy to get everything.”
“For me, (DragCon) is a 
pleasure, but it’s also an assault 
on the body,” said season nine 
contestant and University alum 
Alexis Michelle, who wore a 
stylish 
black-and-silver 
dress 
with a matching feather and 

Everyone loves a diva. From 
Mae West to Marilyn Monroe 
to Aretha, Céline, Madonna, 
Beyoncé and more, the poise 
and inimitable power of the diva 
archetype continues to proliferate 
through time. Arguably the most 
memorable and unique diva of 
our time is Lady Gaga, an artist 
who has fused visual culture, 
the avant-garde and her singular 
voice into a brand which changes 
with the wind, but always 
maintains its originality. Gaga’s 
music alone is a celebration of 
individuality, and combined with 
her experimentation in fashion, 
she consistently creates art that 
will last the test of time. She is 
truly an idol, a perfect example 
of American iconography and 
pop culture at its finest. For 
these reasons, she is heralded as 
an innovator in the public eye, 
but it is also why her upcoming 
film “A Star is Born” is already 
so successful at its release —
seeing Gaga bare-faced and raw 
highlights the soul at the heart 
of her fame, the thing that makes 
her different from the rest.
But the Gaga phenomenon is 
not new, even if this version of the 
movie is: “A Star is Born” has been 
made and remade three times 
before the current iteration, the 
first being released in 1937. The 
original version starring Janet 
Gaynor and its first remake in 
1954 with Judy Garland follow 
the classic storyline that all of 
the films share; a washed-up 
alcoholic male star stumbles 
upon a budding female talent, 
and with his help she becomes 
famous. These first two movies 
ran with the framework to create 
full classic musicals — Judy 
Garland’s film was almost three 
hours of dance numbers and Old 
Hollywood songs — drawing 
on the allure of a rags-to-riches 
narrative to highlight young 
starlets in typical Tinseltown 
fashion. But the most recent 
versions — Barbra Streisand’s 
epic rock musical in 1976 and 
the Lady Gaga / Bradley Cooper 
behemoth this year — take a 
different approach to the conceit, 
instead focusing in on the grit and 
reality behind the shiny image of 
stardom. In both, a well-known 
star is momentarily stripped 
down to her base, allowing an 
eager audience to see the woman 
behind the diva.

When I first saw the trailer for 
this year’s “A Star is Born,” I was 
more excited than I think I’ve 
ever been for a movie release. 2018 
is the year of great music movies, 
“A Star is Born” is among great 
company, like Freddie Mercury 
biopic 
“Bohemian 
Rhapsody” 
and others. The teaser itself 
is a great film, full of emotion 
and a crescendoing close that 
emphasizes the serious approach 
Cooper made as a director to 

fill his movie with music that 
actually holds up alone. I’ve 
listened to the soundtrack’s first 
single, “Shallow,” probably more 
than is healthy. Anyone who 
lives in my dorm has definitely 
heard me screaming it in the 
shower — “I’m off the deep end, 
watch as I dive in, I’ll never meet 
the ground!” This is a testament 
to the power of Lady Gaga; I 
haven’t even seen the movie, 
but the clip of her, no makeup, 
t-shirt and jeans, singing her 
heart out has lodged itself in my 
mind permanently. Many of my 
friends have also fallen prey to 
the trailer, and I assume they too 
are screaming that song in the 
shower. Above my own personal 
excitement, this is evidence of 
why “A Star is Born” has been 
remade three times: It’s not just 
a movie, it’s a phenomenon, one 
that audiences will always love.
But why do we love it so much? 
At the core, “A Star is Born” is 
all about the diva in question. 
Audiences are always a sucker 
for a transformation, whether it 
be in the purest circumstances (à 
la “The Princess Diaries”) or in 
classic rom-coms like “She’s All 
That.” But “A Star is Born” does 
this in a different way, showing 
the artist as a real woman at the 
beginning of her career, being 
brought up the ranks into the star 
we know and love. In this year’s 
version, Lady Gaga is stripped 

down to her roots, upholding 
the conceit of remakes past but 
enhancing it even further. From 
the promotional material and her 
press interviews alone, it is clear 
that the movie is an opportunity 
for fans and the masses alike to 
see Gaga in a new light. This is 
the most obvious draw of the 
film, to take a glimpse behind the 
mask of extravagant excess that 
the singer often creates around 
herself, but the plotline of “A Star 
is Born” adds to its status as a 
phenomenon just as much. It’s an 
interesting take on the American 
Dream, but through the eyes of 
a woman, a relationship and the 
failure of a famous man. In that, 
audiences are given a chance 
to dream for themselves and 
ruminate on the inherent luck 
of fame, stardom and talent in 
the American music industry 
through an interesting lens.
The gender dynamics of “A 
Star is Born” are not uncommon 
in the business, as many women 
in the past have been guided to 
fame by self-destructive men 
over the years. So it’s even more 
powerful to imagine yourself in 
Lady Gaga’s place, knowing that 
her character’s story is not so 
unique in the scape of history. It 
is not all glitz and glamour, and 
“A Star is Born” doesn’t ignore 
this: The film’s common plot 
instead uses the male character’s 
alcoholism as a device to bring 
realism and candor into an 
otherwise fairytale story. That 
realism 
is 
ultimately 
what 
makes the movie’s formula work 
time and time again, and why 
a fourth rendition is popular 
before it has even been released. 
The combination of a common 
story, the allure of seeing the 
diva stripped and a balance 
between the joys and darknesses 
of success allow the viewer to 
simultaneously place themselves 
in the movie and watch as it 
unfolds at the same time. At its 
foundation, “A Star is Born” is 
about rebirth, something that 
through the prism of fame 
becomes vastly more powerful 
than it already is. We all search 
for a sort of rebirth in our lives, 
but it is often hard to tell if you 
are enough to achieve it. The 
success of “A Star is Born” tells us 
that we are enough, and that even 
a diva doesn’t need anything but 
herself to be seen.

jewel-encrusted crown. “These 
convention 
centers 
are 
made 
of concrete, so stepping on this 
cement floor is really, really painful 
for the body. When you spend two 
days setting up and then three 
days, all day on your feet, a lot of 
the time in heels, the body hurts. 
But it’s great other than that.”
In addition to the economic 
and physical fatigue that comes 
with the DragCon experience, 
the notion of gender and trans 
inclusivity posed as a prominent yet 
barely discussed issue. Inclusion 
is, by and large, a central theme of 
both drag culture and “Drag Race,” 
but it’s often dismissed in the case 
of anyone who isn’t a gay man.
In 
the 
words 
of 
Evah 
Destruction, an Atlanta-based drag 
queen who dressed as Elphaba in 
“Wicked” for DragCon, the biggest 
misconception about drag is “that 
it’s a boys game. That it’s all just a 
man’s world because as of now, it’s 
so much more than that.”
“I know that we need more 
people on the front lines that are 
genderqueer, cis-female,” Evah 

continued. “Anyone that wants to 
do drag should be able to do drag 
the way that they want, but also 
have the exposure just as much as 
everyone else gets. We’re not in the 
’70s anymore. It’s not just for men. 
We need to do better.”
This problem directly affects 
RuPaul, who became the subject 
of 
discourse 
last 
May 
after 
making a series of controversial 
comments 
about 
prohibiting 
openly transgender queens from 
competing on his show. Given the 
disproportionate rates of violence 
and murder against the trans 
community, proper representation 
of queer non-cisgender folk in 
both straight and queer media 
remains to be seen, which is why 
events like DragCon provide a 
potential beacon of hope for those 
who feel excluded from their own 
community.
“There’s still so many people 
that are confused as to what drag is 
and how the line is drawn between 
being a drag queen or a transgender 
individual 
or 
genderfluid 
or 
anything in between,” Ophelia 

remarked.
Even 
with 
the 
immense 
progress made in the growing 
mainstream exposure of drag 
culture, there is still a lot of work 
to be done in terms of making it 
even more accessible for more 
marginalized sects of the queer 
community. As Alexis Michelle 
pointed 
out, 
DragCon 
will 
hopefully keep getting bigger and 
fill up entire convention centers in 
the years ahead. Onyx joked that 
she wants DragCon to transform 
into “RuPaul’s Drag Resort.” For 
now, though, the size and scope 
of DragCon represent a radical 
example 
of 
celebrating 
drag 
culture and “RuPaul’s Drag Race” 
for what they are and the potential 
for what they can become.
“It’s so big for the LGBTQ 
community and everybody within 
that spectrum,” Ophelia said. “It 
gives a place where everyone can 
come together and not be judged or 
picked on. There’s no issues here. 
Everybody is happy and friendly 
and living their best life and living 
their truth.”

Behind Enemy Lines: A conversation 
with a Maryland football beat writer

By MIKE PERSAK

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan football team 
did what it was supposed to 
over its last four games.
Against Western Michigan, 
SMU, 
Nebraska 
and 
Northwestern, the 15th-ranked 
Wolverines (4-1 overall, 2-0 
Big Ten) took care of business, 
though last week’s win over the 
Wildcats was closer than most 
expected.
Either way, 
a 4-1 record is 
a 4-1 record.
Now 
Michigan 
turns 
its 
attention 
to 
Maryland (3-1, 
1-0), 
which 
has been hot 
and cold this 
season. 
The 
Terrapins 
started 
their 
season 
with 
a 
promising 
win over No. 19 Texas, but then 
dropped a game to Temple.
Even 
with 
that 
tumultuousness, 
it 
pales 
in 
comparison to what happened 
in the program this offseason.
Head coach D.J. Durkin, who 
was the Wolverines’ defensive 
coordinator in 2015, is currently 
on administrative leave after 
Jordan McNair, an offensive 
lineman, suffered a heat stroke 
during 
a 
summer 
workout 
and died. Since, there has 
been a series of investigations 
into Maryland’s treatment of 
McNair during and after the 
incident that may have led to 
his death.
That has been the central 
storyline 
surrounding 
the 
Terrapins, and rightfully so. 
But there is still football to 
be played, and Maryland may 
be the most talented team 
Michigan has seen since the 
Fighting Irish.
Quarterback 
Kasim 
Hill 
isn’t a world beater, but he 
has shown promise, especially 
with his legs. Hill is joined by 
running backs Ty Johnson and 
Anthony McFarland, who may 
turn out to be one of the better 

backfield duos in the conference 
this 
season. 
Additionally, 
the 
Terrapins’ 
defense 
has 
improved this season, albeit 
against weaker offenses like 
Bowling Green and Minnesota.
Ultimately, the Wolverines 
are heavily favored once again, 
but 
they 
were 
against 
the 
Wildcats too, and we know how 
that ended up.
The Daily spoke with Andy 
Kostka, a football beat reporter 
for 
The 
Diamondback 
— 
Marlyand’s student newspaper 
— to ask about the state of 
Maryland’s program and its 
progress 
on 
the 
field 
this 
season.
The 
Michigan 
Daily: 
Obviously 
a 
tumultuous 
offseason for the program. I’m 
curious, with all that happened, 
what is the current feeling 
towards the program and also 
Durkin in particular? Do people 
think Durkin will survive this?
Andy 
Kostka: 
There 
are 
mixed feelings toward coach 
D.J. Durkin at this point, and 
it depends on who you ask. 
Certainly some students and 
others who watch the team 
aren’t as supportive of Durkin, 
and possibly the team, after 
allegations of a “toxic” team 
culture. But others, such as 
high-level Maryland boosters, 
are firmly in Durkin’s court and 
believe there is no toxic culture 
despite mounting evidence to 
the contrary. Those donors feel 
Durkin should return, but it’s 
fair to say there is quite a split 
in that department.
TMD: 
How 
would 
you 
categorize Maryland’s on-field 
performance so far, with a win 
over Texas but also the loss to 
Temple?
AK: 
Maryland’s 
loss 
to 
Temple was somewhat baffling 
at the time. The week prior, the 
Terps accumulated 444 yards 
on the ground to beat Bowling 
Green, and then managed just 
195 total yards in the home-
opening loss to Temple. One 
reason that may have happened 
was 
because 
Maryland’s 
starting tackles, Derwin Gray 
and Damian Prince, both missed 
the game through injury. That 
performance was very much 

an anomaly, and Gray and 
Prince should both be healthy 
this weekend. Throughout the 
year, Maryland has relied on 
its running game and picked 
its spots for throws. When 
the running game isn’t able to 
function to full effect, there 
may be issues, like there were 
against Temple.
TMD: 
Maryland’s 
defense 
seems to have been a bit hit-
or-miss this season. How do 
you expect them to hold up on 
Saturday?
AK: The Terps’ defense has 
played better overall than last 
year, even with lapses against 
Temple. 
But 
it 
remains 
to 
be seen how Maryland will 
respond on the road against, 
statistically, the highest-ranked 
offense it has seen this year. 
The Terps held Minnesota and 
Bowling Green — ranked No. 
109 and 112 in total offense 
this year, respectively — to 
27 combined points. But then 
Maryland allowed 35 to Temple, 
who ranks at 105. So, while 

Michigan isn’t an offensive 
juggernaut, it should be a bigger 
test against the No. 66 total 
offense Saturday. 
TMD: 
Ty 
Johnson 
and 
Anthony McFarland have been 
very solid this season. What, in 
your eyes, makes them a threat?
AK: Both backs have big-play 
ability. Ty Johnson broke off 
an 81-yard touchdown run last 
week and Anthony McFarland 
scored on a 64-yard carry. 
Both tailbacks seem to have 
another gear in space and they 
have each used that well so far. 
Their success will dictate how 
Maryland will play.
TMD: 
How 
has 
Kasim 
Hill performed compared to 
expectations? And is he talented 
enough to carry the offense if 
the run game isn’t clicking?
AK: Kasim Hill isn’t likely 
to lead Maryland to victory 
solely through the air. He needs 
a running game to open up 
passing lanes, and has shown a 
tendency at times, especially on 
deep throws, to miss the mark. 

He’s completing 55 percent of 
his passes. Hill’s best attribute, 
perhaps, is that he doesn’t seem 
to have a knack of turning the 
ball over and he can be relied 
upon to hit targets from short 
or medium range. I think he 
has matched expectations so 
far. He probably won’t pick 
apart 
Michigan’s 
secondary, 
but it will be imperative that 
he does enough through the air 
to prevent the Wolverines from 
stacking the box to stop the 
run.
TMD: Maryland wins if...
AK: It has a positive turnover 
ratio and both McFarland and 
Johnson find ample running 
room — and the end zone a few 
times.
TMD: Michigan wins if...
AK: 
The 
above 
doesn’t 
happen. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
defense will likely make moving 
the football somewhat of a 
challenge.
TMD: Score prediction?
AK: Michigan 32, Maryland 
17.

A

ndrew Robinson 
remembers his debut 
for the Michigan 
football team. You 
probably don’t. 

In the penultimate game of the 2015 
regular season at Penn State, starting 
long snapper Scott Sypniewski 
was sidelined with an injury. So 
it was Robinson, then a redshirt 
freshman, who quietly filled in and 
executed — his first of just five career 
appearances.
The fifth-year senior walk-on knows 
recognition is hard to come by as a 
backup, let alone as a long snapper, 
perhaps the most anonymous 
position in football. 
Being seen was never his concern. 
Praise and frustration are heaped 
upon guys like Rashan Gary and Shea 
Patterson. Their potential lies in 
making the NFL — the NCAA being 
a given. But Robinson, like so many 
on the Wolverines’ roster, has an 
unnoticeable career. 
“I remember seeing a tweet and 
someone said ‘Oh, Sypniewski’s been 
banged up, they might get Andrew 
Robinson a chance,’ ” he recalled. 
“And someone tweeted, ‘Who is 
Andrew Robinson? I’ve never heard 
of him.’ And I was like, ‘Exactly.’ 
“You don’t want to be known.”
***
Andrew admits that long snapping 
wasn’t his, nor frankly anyone’s, 
first choice. But it was his ticket 
to accomplishing what seemed 
unimaginable — playing college 

football. Choosing which school 
to play for was a far-flung, second 
objective. 
At Athens High School in Troy, 
Mich., Andrew played football and 
lacrosse. His younger brother by 
two years, Bradley, played the same 
positions, and his father, Brad, was an 
assistant coach for the football team.
“Bradley and Andrew always worked 
their tail off in the weight room 
for me, dedicated to the program,” 
said Josh Heppner, the brothers’ 
high school coach. “They worked 
hard, played offensive line, did some 
things on defensive line for us, but 
they found their niche with long 
snapping.”
Starting in youth leagues, Andrew 
played as an offensive lineman. 
But his short stature — currently 
at 6-feet and 218 pounds — was an 
early indicator that he wouldn’t fit 
the prototypical lineman build. None 
of Michigan’s scholarship linemen 
weigh under 300 pounds.
He also started long snapping in 
eighth grade. His coach didn’t like 
his form, but Andrew was the only 
one who could snap the ball at least 
13 yards. So he assumed the role, and 
it stuck when Heppner needed a long 
snapper. 
During his sophomore year of high 
school, rotating between offensive 
lineman and long snapper, collegiate 
aspirations weren’t gaining traction. 
Thus began the reckoning of an 
uncertain future.
“I wanted to play college football, 
so I knew I needed a niche,” 

Andrew said. “My dad had done 
a bunch of research and saw 
a (long snapper) had gotten a 
scholarship offer from Notre 

Dame, Nebraska. So he’s like, ‘Okay, 
let me figure out more about this.’ 
And then next thing you know, I got a 
Twitter (direct message) from Chris 
Rubio and he just said ‘Hey, my name 
is Chris Rubio, check out Rubio Long 
Snapping.’ So I checked it out and 
was like ‘Let’s go to a camp.’ ”
Added Brad: “We came back from 
the Chicago trip and he sat down 
with his mom and myself and said 
‘I want to do this. I want to do more 
camps, get better at it.’ And that’s 
what we did.”
The Rubio Long Snapping camp 
began 14 years ago, starting with six 
participants and growing to as many 
as 300 at the most recent camp. 
Six years since their first meeting, 
Rubio — a former long snapper at 
UCLA — still has lasting impressions 
of Andrew.
“Honestly, one of my top snappers,” 
Rubio said. “He wasn’t silent, I’m a 
big fan of that because I don’t like 
when long snappers are tense. When 
they’re tense they never do well. … If 
he never hears his name, he’s done a 
great job.”
And being heard was difficult, 
anyway. Rubio compiled film and 
offered a communication channel 
for his long snappers to find open 
roster spots at the collegiate level. 
Andrew sent his own edited tapes 
to schools, even making a trick shot 
video in 2013 — a YouTube clip that 
still rouses laughter amongst his 
teammates. 
He doesn’t mind them poking 
fun. How else was a long snapper 

supposed to make himself known 
when doing so is the very antithesis 
of the position? 
***
Andrew traveled to Grand Valley 
State and Ferris State. Lehigh called. 
Then Butler and Central Michigan. 
Michigan State inquired, followed by 
radio silence. The attention he finally 
earned was humdrum. 
Then, Brady Hoke and Michigan — 
which hadn’t recruited a player from 
Troy Athens since 2002 — chimed in. 
“One day, I got a text message from 
Allen Trieu from Scout.com and 
he said, ‘Hey, I don’t want to jinx it, 
but Michigan just called me about 
you. They’re coming to visit you 
tomorrow.’ ” Andrew remembered. 
“And I was like, ‘You know this is 
Andrew Robinson, right?’ He goes, 
‘Yeah, I know.’ I was starstruck. I 
was like, ‘Really? I got on Michigan’s 
radar?’
“I remember running down into the 
basement where my dad was. I told 
him, ‘Hey, I just got told Michigan is 
gonna come visit me tomorrow.’ He 
was like ‘Yeah, right. You’re kidding.’ 
… I got called out of class and people 
are like, ‘A-Rob’s meeting with 
Michigan?’ It was a big joke, like, ‘Oh, 
it’s snapper Rob.’ No one thought 
that I’d end up where I was.”
Neither did his father. He never 
envisioned Andrew making it to the 
next level. Both Andrew and Bradley 
making it as long snappers was 
unthinkable.
But when Andrew got his walk-on 
offer from Michigan shortly after, it 
also represented a foot in the door 
for Bradley. 
Between the two brothers, Bradley 
is the taller, leaner one. It’s why 

Andrew only calls him his “baby 
brother” instead of “little brother.” 
It’s also why, with Andrew’s 
experience to guide him, Bradley’s 
D-I offers were proactive and 
not reactive — Illinois, Louisville, 
Auburn, Wisconsin, Penn State and 
Michigan State all reached out.
The attention gives Brad and 
Andrew a laugh — Bradley didn’t 
even want to long snap. He wanted 
to be a quarterback. His stature said 
otherwise. 
“He 
really 
fell in 
love 
with it 
when 
he 
first 
met 
Chris 

Rubio,” Brad said. “Andrew’s 
participating (at a camp) and 
Bradley’s going, ‘I could do this.’ … 
On his way home from camp he says, 
‘I want to do this too. I want to start 
going to camps.’ ”
From there, the “consistency” of the 
Robinson brothers, as Heppner puts 
it, elevated Bradley into a greater 
spotlight. After wading through 
offers and one year as a Spartan, 

ETHAN WOLFE DAILY SPORTS WRITER


Bradley, encouraged by his brother, 
found a home at Ohio State where 
he’s now a junior. 
For two brothers at rival schools — 
with a father who is a Michigan State 
grad, nonetheless — their bond is less 
competitive than imagined.
“They both compete with each other, 
but they’re also super close and they 
mentor each other,” Brad said. “A lot 
of things Andrew has gone through, 
Bradley has been able to grow and 
see how it is.”

There are exceptions, of course, like 
how Andrew and Bradley have the 
same haircut — what Andrew calls 
the “Conor McGregor fade.” They 
have a bet: whichever team loses the 
Michigan-Ohio State game this year, 
the losing brother shaves their head 
and stays bald the rest of the year. 
***
As Andrew reflects during his fifth 
and final year, he talks with veteran 
confidence.
When he was hanging out with 

the Wolverine specialists at 
Northwestern this past weekend, his 
teammates discussed Devin Gardner 
like an ancient relic of Michigan 
football history. He was Andrew’s 
freshman year teammate. 
Former classmates of his who have 
transferred or graduated like Drake 
Harris, Moe Ways, Ian Bunting and 
Wilton Speight make his final year 
quieter. Dymonte Thomas, who 
used to pray in the north end zone of 
Michigan Stadium with Andrew 
before games, is now in his second 
season with the Denver Broncos. 
Now, Andrew’s pregame praying 
ritual is back to a familiar spot off the 
field. He kneels facing north, alone, 
by the left hash that he has snapped 
from for five years. Now Bradley 
prays with his classmate, running 
back Master Teague, before games. 
Off the field and out of mind, it’s hard 
to imagine Andrew’s journey as a 
whirlwind, but that’s exactly how it 
is. Does he wish he played more? Of 
course. But he doesn’t think about 
it. Starting long snapper Camaron 
Cheeseman is one of his good 
friends. Andrew actually likes being 
one of the first guys to congratulate 
the special teams unit after a play. 
Being a Michigan football player 
— the rah-rah and tradition that 
trumped any other D-I or D-II offer 
he got — is forever inscribed in his 
identity. 
“I’ll never forget when I met (former 
kicker) Kenny Allen’s mom the first 
time, and she told me at our first 
game, that when you see your kid 
running out of that field to touch that 
banner, you will cry, you will tear up,” 
Brad said. “Ever since that happened, 
I do. I get a little tightness in the 
chest because of that tradition, and I 
love it and it’s the greatest feeling.”

And when Andrew has gotten that 
rare chance to go into a game, the 
tear ducts well up. But if you’re not 
paying attention, he’s happier. Since 
2015, Andrew has only seen game 
action in 2016 against Hawaii 
and Rutgers and in 2017 against 
Wisconsin and Ohio State.
“I want to get thrown in the game 
and I almost don’t want Coach (Jim) 
Harbaugh to know I was in the game 
until he watches film, because I want 
to be the best I could be,” Andrew 
said. “It’s one of those things that 
you don’t wanna be known until 
someone puts on the tape and sees 
49 was in.”
Added Rubio: “A good long snapper 
is like a Honda Accord. It’s not the 
flashiest car in the world, but it’ll 
get you from point A to point B. … 
On fourth down, (a coach) wants 
to yell at his linebacker to get him 
the ball back or at his quarterback 
for throwing an interception or 
whatever. 
“Long snapping is one of those things 
he doesn’t want to think about.”
The age-old adages of reflection 
surface when talking to Robinson. 
There are no regrets going to 
Michigan and getting his degree in 
movement science. As of this fall, he’s 
applied to physical therapy schools 
and is even weighing participating in 
Michigan’s pro day.
A long snapper who has played in 
five games making it to the NFL 
seems like a pipe dream, but it 
doesn’t faze Andrew. He references 
Detroit Lions’ long snapper Don 
Muhlbach, who played only one 
season in college and is now a 15-year 
vet. To prepare, Andrew works with 
former NFL special teams coach 
Greg Zauner on his snapping.
With a degree in his back pocket, he 

says it’s better than never trying.
***
On Nov. 23, Brad and his wife 
Susanna will drive down to 
Columbus, Ohio in their pickup truck 
in anticipation for what is to come 
the next day. Their sons probably 
won’t see the field, but who knows 
that over a month away? Either way, 
they’ll be proud. 
It’ll be their first and only game they 
attend together this college football 
season, just as planned. Normally, 
they “divide and conquer.” Just 
this past weekend, Brad traveled 
to Evanston to see Andrew and 
Michigan, while Susanna ventured 
to Happy Valley to see Bradley and 
Ohio State. In Columbus, it’ll be the 
last time the two brothers will share 
a field.
Like any other fan would do, the 
couple will set up to tailgate with 
friends and family and let loose 
before another iteration of one of the 
sport’s greatest rivalries.
Neither of them really care who 
wins, if they’re being honest. And 

they may not be congratulated for 
their kids’ on-field performance. 
They’ll just be thinking about how 
they’ll celebrate with their sons after 
the game. 
It won’t be their last post-game 
celebration together, though. It’ll be 
their first. 
“We’ve made it a goal that when 
they’re done with their college 
careers and have families,” Brad said, 
“on Thanksgiving weekends we’ll 
either be at Ohio State or (Michigan) 
and that’ll be our tradition.”
So when they park at Ohio Stadium 
and prepare to tailgate and watch 
the game, the routine is the same. 
The faces of passersby will tense up 
seeing the back of their truck — side-
by-side Michigan and Ohio State 
football stickers. 
Brad has heard the question often: 
“What’s up with that?”
“It’s a unique situation,” he explains.

Breakdown: Michigan vs. Maryland

By MAX MARCOVITCH 

Daily Sports Editor

There is quite a bit of noise 
swirling 
around 
Maryland 
football right now. This preview 
will choose to focus on the field, 
aimed at the team that will be 
traveling to Ann Arbor to play 
Michigan on Saturday. But there 
is plenty to read about the rest, 
most of which is not good.
The Terrapins come into the 
game a confounding 3-1 team. 
They notched a statement 34-29 
win at Texas in week two, 
before losing by 21 points the 
next week against Temple. They 
then responded with a 42-13 
trampling of Minnesota, and are 
on the fringe of the AP Top 25, 
receiving 10 votes in this week’s 
poll.
Maryland will be the most 
complete team the Wolverines 
have faced since Notre Dame, 
and thus an adequate tune-
up ahead of the daunting four 
weeks that loom on the horizon. 
The Daily breaks down what to 
expect in this week’s Big Ten 
bout:

Maryland passing game vs. 
Michigan defense

The first thing you’ll notice 
about Maryland’s offense is 
the regular motion. On nearly 
every play, a player comes 
across the formation, whether 
the quarterback is under center 
or in the shotgun. Sometimes 
this 
is 
designed 
to 
cause 
misdirection, in the form of a 
jet sweep or another creative 
run. Often, it’s just used to get 
the linebackers moving and the 
defense scrambling.
It allows several different 
options off those looks. The 
Terrapins like to get their 
quarterbacks on the move as 
often as possible. Notice the 
plural. 
Redshirt 
freshman 
Kasim Hill will start and play 
most of the game. He’s the 
better passer, and a far more 
well-rounded 
quarterback. 
He’s also shown a solid ability 
to navigate the pocket. Tyrrell 
Pigrome might also get some 
time under center. Pigrome is 
the dual-threat option, as he’s 
only thrown eight passes on the 
season and completed just four. 
More often than not, when he’s 
in the game, it’s a running play 
in some form. Both Pigrome 

and Hill suffered season-ending 
ACL injuries last season that 
decimated Maryland’s season. 
Hill will get the majority of the 
snaps, but don’t be surprised 
to see Pigrome play for a few 
series’.
It’s not the most prolific 
passing game the Wolverines 
will face this season — but it’s 
formidable and poses a test, 
nonetheless. In the Terrapins’ 
loss to Temple this season, 
Pigrome and Hill combined 
to complete just eight of their 
21 passes for 63 yards and two 
interceptions. On the flip side, 
in their win over Texas, the 
duo was a combined 20-for-33 
for 244 yards and a touchdown. 
If Maryland can establish the 
run early and keep Michigan’s 
pass-rushers off balance, its 

passing game can pick its spots 
effectively. The Terrapins’ best 
shot is in a close, low-scoring 
game.
If not? Well, ask Adrian 
Martinez what can happen to 
a freshman quarterback on the 
road in a spread offense playing 
against the top-ranked defense 
in the country.

Maryland running game vs. 
Michigan defense

Again, it all starts with the 
motion. The Terrapins will run 
jet sweeps, counters off those jet 
sweeps, then play action off that. 
Whether it’s the best approach 
against the Wolverines’ defense 
— with one of the most athletic 
linebacking corps in the country 
— remains to be seen. But it is 

the look Maryland will come out 
with.
For that reason, it’s a rushing 
attack predicated on balance. 
The Terrapins’ leading rusher, 
Ty Johnson, has just 40 carries 
on the season. Michigan senior 
running back Karan Higdon 
tallied 30 carries last week 
alone. For Maryland, 13 players 
have registered at least one 
carry this season; five have a per 
carry average over seven yards, 
and the same five have rushed 
for at least one touchdown 
over 20 yards. That’s where the 
majority of the big plays in this 
offense will come from. 
Michigan allows just 86 yards 
per game on the ground, good 
for seventh in the nation. But the 
Terrapins’ running game might 
pose the most well-rounded test 

yet. 

Michigan passing game vs. 
Maryland pass defense

Lost a bit in the flair of 
junior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson’s 
comeback 
last 
week 
against 
Northwestern: 
Michigan’s passing game is far 
from clicking on all cylinders. 
Patterson missed open receivers 
on numerous occasions, despite 
having arguably the best pass 
protection of the season. 

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily
Senior running back Karan Higdon notched 30 carries in a single game, helping the Wolverines to a 20-17 comeback win last week at Northwestern.

Saturday’s game.

TheMichiganDaily, www.michigandaily.com

Playing at home this weekend 
will likely help cure some of 
those struggles. In three home 
games, Patterson has completed 
72 percent of his passes, totaling 
482 yards and seven touchdown 
passes. In two road games, he’s 
yet to throw for a touchdown.
Some of that may be contingent 
on strength of opponent, sure. 
This weekend will help answer 
as to how much. Maryland’s 
pass defense allows roughly 210 
yards per game, a respectable 
50th 
nationally. 
In 
general, 
the Terrapins will be the best 
defense to come into Michigan 
Stadium thus far this season. 
One of the best determinants 
of how effective the passing 
game will be — and can continue 
to be going forward — is the 
continued improvement of the 
pass protection.
“Pass 
protection 
is 
going 
pretty well,” redshirt junior 
left tackle Jon Runyan said on 
Monday. “… Shea’s had time, and 
when he has time, he can make 

unbelievable plays with his arm.”
Maryland comes into the game 
with 11 sacks on the season, 
and will put Runyan’s words 
to the test, especially with big 
matchups 
against 
Wisconsin, 
Michigan State and Penn State 
looming. 

Michigan running game vs. 
Maryland run defense

If junior Chris Evans (listed 
as questionable) is able to play 
Saturday, it will be the first time 
both he and Higdon have played 
since week two against Western 
Michigan. In that game, both got 
double-digit carries, combining 
for an efficient 23-carry, 245-
yard 
performance, 
adding 
three touchdowns. It’s the duo 
that compelled many to think 
Michigan’s running game could 
be a pillar of this team.
So far this season, results 
have been uneven. Against the 
Broncos, the Wolverines racked 
up 308 yards on the ground. 

Against 
Notre 
Dame, 
that 
number was just 58. If Michigan 
is 
to 
accomplish 
its 
goals 
this season — beating rivals, 
competing for the Big Ten, etc. 
— it will have to do so with the 
foundation of an above-average 
running game. 
While Maryland isn’t quite 
at the level of an Ohio State or 
Michigan State, it’s a step in that 
direction. The Terrapins allow 
just 104 yards on the ground per 
game, good for 18th nationally. 

Special teams

There’s a real argument to be 
made that the biggest strength of 
this Michigan team is not its top-
ranked defense, but its special 
teams. Suddenly, junior Will Hart 
is one of the best punters in the 
country, averaging a staggering 
52.1 yards per punt. It’s just 
one of the ways the Wolverines’ 
special teams continue to give 
them a subtle advantage week in, 
week out. Punt and kick coverage 

included.
“It’s been a big deal for us,” 
said fifth-year senior special 
teams 
extraordinaire 
Joe 
Hewlett. “We really want to be 
aggressive and we really kind of 
take that to heart. … Going 85-90 
yards on our defense is not going 
to really happen that often.”
Hewlett also said the group 
has been setting — and meeting 
— goals. Hewlett said those 
goals include giving the offense 
an average drive start past the 
30-yard line, hold the opposing 
team to fewer than 15 yards per 
return, and meeting a certain net 
punt yards measurement.
After week three, Hewlett 
says, the group evaluated all 
these measures. They’ve met 
them all.
That, of course, goes without 
mentioning redshirt sophomore 
kicker Quinn Nordin, who has 
now hit six of his seven field 
goal attempts this season, with a 
seemingly limitless leg.

Breakdown

Excluding 
Notre 
Dame, 
Maryland will be the best team 
Michigan has faced this season. 
It has offensive balance and 
defensive talent. If the game is 
close, the Terrapins’ rushing 
attack could control the game. 
It’s not a game the Wolverines 
should lose, but it’s absolutely 
one they could.
That being said, Jim Harbaugh 
is 20-4 at home in his time at 
Michigan for a reason. The 
Wolverines are hard to beat 
at 
Michigan 
Stadium. 
After 
a lackluster first half against 
Northwestern, expect defensive 
coordinator Don Brown to have 
his defense ready to wreak havoc 
early and often.
Michigan 
takes 
an 
early, 
commanding lead and never 
looks back.

Prediction: 
Michigan 
31, 
Maryland 13

CAMERON HUNT/Daily
Junior Will Hart is averaging 52.1 yards per punt so far this season as one of the best punters in the nation, giving the Wolverines’ special teams unit a subtle advantage during matchups.

What to Watch For: Maryland

By MARK CALCAGNO 

Daily Sports Editor

On Saturday, the Michigan 
football team is back home, 
where it has dominated all 
three of its opponents this 
season.
The last of these opponents 
was 
Nebraska, 
which 
the 
Wolverines 
drubbed, 
56-10, 
in a game that was essentially 
over 
halfway 
through 
the 
first 
quarter. 
But 
last 
week, Michigan traveled to 
Northwestern — a team coming 
off a bye — and nearly threw 
away its season before coming 
back to win, 20-17.
The Wolverines’ opponent 
this weekend is also coming 
off a bye and has the capability 
to 
give 
them 
challenges. 
Maryland defeated now-No.19 
Texas in its season opener and 
is 3-1 to start the year.
That’s 
all 
under 
interim 
coach 
Matt 
Canada, 
who 
took over for D.J. Durkin in 
August after the tragic death 
of offensive lineman Jordan 
McNair. Durkin was Michigan’s 
defensive 
coordinator 
in 
2015 before leaving for the 
Terrapins.
With 
Durkin 
still 
on 
administrative leave, the only 
other focus is Saturday’s game. 
Here’s what to watch for.

Slants

Just as they did against 
SMU, the Wolverines struggled 
against the slant and mesh 
patterns last week. According 
to 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown, 
Northwestern 
quarterback Clayton Thorson 
went 3-of-5 for 23 yards in 
the first half and 2-of-4 for 22 
yards on such plays.
The key difference is that 
Michigan was able to stymie 
Thorson as the game went on. 
The Wildcats didn’t score after 
jumping out to a 17-0 lead, as 
the Wolverines allowed just 119 
yards the last three quarters.
Still, teams have smartly 
looked to take advantage of 
those slants against Michigan. 
Brown’s defense is predicated 
on getting free rushers on 
the quarterback, which often 
requires linebackers to push 
rush, leaving the middle of 
the field open. The slant is 

the perfect pattern to take 
advantage.
But 
Brown 
isn’t 
all 
too 
concerned, noting Thorson’s 
ability to fit passes into tight 
spots.
“I 
thought 
Thorson 
was 
pretty 
good,” 
Brown 
said 
Wednesday. “He’s going to end 
up graduating, I would bet, 
as one of the top-25 throwers 
probably in the history of 
the Big Ten. There are two 
catches … where he puts it into 
a window about this big. (But) 
I’m not going to stand here and 
say, ‘Jeez, we did a great job.’ ”
Though 
the 
Wolverines 
found success with more press 
coverage later on against the 
Wildcats, slants could be a 
large part of Maryland’s game 
plan Saturday.

Rashan Gary’s health

Like the team itself, Rashan 
Gary had one of his best 
quarters of the season two 
weeks ago. The junior defensive 
end 
manhandled 
Nebraska’s 
offensive tackles and earned 
his first sack of the season in 

the first quarter.
But he left the game soon 
after and didn’t return. Based 
upon exercises he did with 
trainers on the sideline, it 
looked to be a shoulder or arm 
injury.
Gary brushed it off publicly 
last week, but the injury bug 
bit him again in Evanston. He 
left the game and went to the 
locker room during the third 
quarter — though he did return 
eventually. 
Gary is “questionable” to 
play Saturday.
“He’s day-to-day, so we’ll 
see,” Brown said. “Not really 
sure right now. (We’ll) let the 
trainers see if they can put him 
back together for the weekend.”
If Gary can’t go, sophomore 
Kwity Paye or freshman Aidan 
Hutchinson would likely earn 
their first career starts. Both 
have played well recently: Paye 
collected two sacks last week, 
while 
Hutchinson 
earned 
three tackles — one for a loss — 
against the Cornhuskers.
“Kwity Paye certainly has 
stood up when we’ve needed 
him to stand up, along with the 

other guys,” Brown said.

Receiver depth

It was interesting to see 
Ronnie Bell receive a jet sweep 
on 
Michigan’s 
second 
play 
from scrimmage last week. The 
freshman receiver had been 
previously featured mostly in 
the second half of blowouts, 
with redshirt freshman Dylan 
McCaffery under center instead 
of junior Shea Patterson.
But Bell played ahead of 
redshirt 
freshman 
Oliver 
Martin on Saturday — a major 
surprise considering Bell had 
no Division I football offers at 
this time last year.
Elsewhere in the position 
group, Harbaugh said he hopes 
to get junior receiver Nate 
Schoenle back this weekend. 
Schoenle earned a scholarship 
at the end of fall camp after 
catching four passes for 41 
yards in 2017.
Though he’s unlikely to play 
this week, freshman Michael 
Barrett has moved to receiver 
after 
practicing 
at 
VIPER
