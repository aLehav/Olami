Rankings change a source of worry

National Research
Council overhauling
methodology of
long-awaited report
By ESHWAR
THIRUNAVUKKARASU
DailyStaffReporter
The success of university
researchers is about to be quanti-

fied, and that fact has officials at
colleges across the country sweat-
ing.
Considered by many as the pre-
eminent system for assessing doc-
torate programs, the United States
National Research Council report
ranks 222 institutions nationwide
over 61 different doctoral fields.
The ratings attract a lot of
attention because they come out
about once every 10 years. But this
forthcoming report is already four
years late, as the last edition came

out in 1995. Though the release of
this version is expected in the very
near future, nobody knows exactly
when that publication date will be.
The NRC, which recently
released its ranking methodology,
will be using survey data of par-
ticipating universities from the
2005-2006 academic year. Applied
to individual doctorate programs,
the rankings rely on a wide range
of criteria, which include the num-
ber of publications and grants pro-
duced by faculty, demographics

like minority composition and cur-
rent rankings.
Averaging all departmental
scores, the University of Michigan
scored third overall on the NRC's
previous list of rankings in 1995,
behind the University of Califor-
nia, Berkley and first-ranked Stan-
ford University.
In an interview this week, for-
mer University President James
Duderstadt, who is also a professor
of science and engineering, said

Annual homecoming tailgate
set to go green this weekend

CAMPUS CRIME
Diag incident ends in pepper spray

All trash from event
to be recycled, reused
or composted
By OLIVIA CARRINO
For the Daily
"Go Blue, Live Green" may
become a reality on campus this
weekend when the University's
first zero waste tailgate takes place
tomorrow at the 33rd Annual Go
Blue Homecoming Tailgate at Oost-

erbaan Fieldhouse.
Every year the Go Blue Tailgate
welcomes 3,000 alumni, students
and friends to enjoy food, cama-
raderie and entertainment. This
year, the event is taking the whole
production one step further. Zero
waste means all materials at the
tailgate will be reused, recycled or
composted. This eliminates the
need to send garbage to landfills.
The Alumni Association in
partnership with the Student Sus-
tainability Initiative and the Uni-
versity's Department of Refuse and

Recycling is organizing the event.
SSI is an on-campus group of lead-
ers in government groups, envi-
ronmental groups and individuals
who want to make the University of
Michigan a leader in sustainability.
At the tailgate, all plates will be
made from bamboo and all utensils
will be made from corn syrup. Both
are entirely compostable, as are the
cups, napkins and trash liners that
will be used. All compostable mate-
rials will be transported to a local
composting farm.

After one man
resists arrests,
police take action
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
Passers-by stood and watched
as University Police confronted
two men near the Diag yesterday
in an incident that ended when one
of the men was subdued with pep-
per spray.
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown said
University Police were called to
the scene after reports that the two

men were demanding money from
students walkingin the area.
"We received a report of two
people on the Diag, or in the Diag
area, who were aggressively pan-
handling," Brown said, adding that
the panhandling was not being
carried out in a way that would be
considered robbery.
Once University Police arrived,
the two men were read trespassing
rights and were asked to leave Uni-
versity property, Brown said.
Brown said that while one of the
subjects readily cooperated with
officers and was escorted from
campus peacefully, the other sub-
ject - a 49-year-old man - resist-
ed arrest.

"We had reports of him aggres-
sively panhandling and so we were
escorting him off campus property
when he resisted police instruc-
tions and then ultimately resisted
the police officer when he was
told he was going to be arrested,"
Brown said.
While resisting arrest, the
subject - who Brown said was
inebriated - began to fight with
University Police. In response,
police officers used pepper spray
to subdue the man. Brown said he
was then taken into custody and to
the University Hospital because he
was complaining of physical dis-
comfort.

University officials pick Zernicke as
new School of Kinesiology dean

By VANESSA NUNEZ

University President Mary Sue
Coleman and Univesity Provost

Kinesiology on Monday.
Zernicke's appointment, which
is contingent on approval from the
University's Board of Regents, will

go into effect on Jan. 1, 2010.
Zernicke has been the director
of the University's Bone & Joint
Injury Prevention & Rehabilita-

to being a faculty member in the
Department of Biomedical Engi-

was very happy with Zernicke's
appointment and looked forward
to working with him.
"President Coleman and I are
extremely pleased that Dr. Zer-

nicke is assuming the leadership
of the School of Kinesiology at this
time of dramatic change within
the study of human movement,"
Sullivan said.
Zernicke's appointment comes
after two rounds of interviews that
took place after Beverly Ulrich, the
former dean of the School of Kine-

In response to the selection,
Ulrich wrote in a statement that

Indiana man
admits to stealing
cemetery funds
A man admits embezzling
about $4.2 million in perpetual-
care trust funds from a Michigan
cemetery operated by his India-
napolis-based company.
Michigan Attorney General
Mike Cox announced yesterday
that Robert Nelms of Green-
wood, Ind., pleaded guilty in
Kent County Circuit Court to
embezzlement and failing to
trust funeral contracts. He faces
up to 10 years in prison.
Nelms is accused of stealing
about $24 million from the trusts
of funeral homes and cemeteries
he controlled in Michigan and
Indiana.
About $4.2 million was taken
from Chapel Hill Memorial Gar-
dens in Grand Rapids. Nelms faces
charges inIndiana for the rest.

Woman given
wrong embryo
An Ohio woman who is car-
rying another woman's baby
because of a fertility clinic error
says she's still not sure where to
place the blame.
Carolyn Savage told The Asso-
ciated Press yesterday that she
and her husband have not been
told who made the mistake or
@ why it happened.
She says that "hopefully some-
day an explanation will come."
The 40-year-old woman from
the Toledo suburb of Sylvania is
due to give birth within the next
two weeks. The couple say they
will give the baby boy over to his
biological parents, who live in
Michigan.
The Savages' attorney says
he's been contact with a lawyer
for the fertility clinic. He says he
hopes they can reach a resolution
without going to court.
The Savages have not dis-
closed the name of the clinic.
WASHINGTON
Up to 8 Uighurs to
leave Guantanamo
The Obama administration
says at least six, and as many
as eight, Chinese Muslims held
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, will
soon leave their island prison
for freedom in another island
nation, Palau.
Word of the upcoming trans-
fer to the tiny Pacific country,
* planned for sometime after Oct.
1, came in a letter released yes-
terday from Solicitor General El-
enaKagantothe Supreme Court.
Kagan also confirmed that Palau
has agreed to accept all but one
ofthe 13 Chinese Muslims, orUi-
ghurs (pronounced WEE'-gurs),
who remain at Guantanamo.
Kagan's letter was intended to
demonstrate that the adminis-
tration was the process of mov-
ing the Uighurs out of Guantan-

amo and that the Supreme Court
thus would not need to review a
challenge over their detention.
Six Uighur detainees have
agreed to the transfer and at-
tempts to persuade two others
are ongoing, Kagan wrote.
BAHGDAD
Members of
al-Qaida escape
 from Iraqi prison
U.S. aircraft and Iraqi patrols
combined in a massive manhunt
Thursday after the escape of 16
prisoners - including five al-Qai-
da-linked inmates awaiting exe-
cution - who apparently crawled
through a bathroom window in a
makeshift jail on a former com-
pound of Saddam Hussein.
The jailbreak in Saddam's
hometown Tikrit highlighted
the struggles for Iraqi authori-
ties to maintain control over an
overcrowded prison system and
absorb thousands of detainees
turned over by U.S. forces as part
of a broad security pact. At least
two senior officials were fired
after the late Wednesday escape.
Few details on the fugitives
were provided by Iraqi security
chiefs. But five were Iraqis who
were sentenced to death for ter-
rorism-related crimes and links
to al-Qaida in Iraq, said a Tikrit
police officer, said on condition
of anonymity because he was
not authorized to discuss the
operation with media.

Feds: Suspect hit beauty
stores for bomb supplies

Airport shuttle driver
buys supplies for
homemade bomb
NEW YORK (AP) - An Afghan
immigrant who received explo-
sives training from al-Qaida went
from one beauty supply store to
another, buying up large quanti-
ties of hydrogen peroxide and nail-
polish remover, in a chilling plot
to build bombs for attacks on U.S.
soil, authorities charged yesterday.
Najibullah Zazi, a 24-year-old
shuttle driver at the Denver air-
port, was indicted in New York
on charges of conspiracy to use
weapons of mass destruction.
Investigators found bomb-making
instructions on his computer's
hard drive and said Zazi used a
hotel room in Colorado to try to
cook up explosives a few weeks ago
before atrip to New York.
The extent of Zazi's ties to al-

Qaida was unclear, but if the alle-
gations prove true, this could be
the first operating al-Qaida cell to
be uncovered inside the U.S. since
the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Over the
past few days, talk of the possible
plot set off the most intense flurry
of national terrorism warnings
since the aftermath of 9/11.
Prosecutors said they have yet to
establish exactly when and where
the Zazi attacks were supposed to
take place. But Attorney General
Eric Holder said in Washington,
"We believe any imminent threat
arising from this case has been dis-
rupted."
A law enforcement official told
The Associated Press yesterday
that Zazi had associates in New
York who were in on the plot.
Zazi was arrested in Denver last
weekend and was charged along
with his father and a New York
City imam with lying to investiga-
tors. Authorities said in the past
few days that they feared Zazi and

others might have been planning
to detonate homemade bombs on
New York trains, and warnings
went out to transit systems, stadi-
ums and hotels nationwide.
Explosives built with hydro-
gen peroxide killed 52 people four
years ago intheLondonctransitsys-
tem. They are easy to conceal and
detonate, and last week's warnings
asked authorities to be on the look-
out for them.
A law enforcement official said
Thursday that authorities had been
so worried about Zazi - and that
his Sept. 10 trip to New York City
coincided with a visit by President
Barack Obama - that they consid-
ered arresting him as soon as he
reached the city. The official spoke
on condition of anonymity because
the investigation continues.
Zazi left a Denver court yester-
day without commenting and will
be transferred soon to New York.
He and his lawyer have denied he
is a terrorist.

Kirk will be the
interim replacement
until special election
in January
BOSTON (AP) - Paul G. Kirk
Jr. served Edward M. Kennedy
as an aide, rooted beside him at
Harvard-Yale football games and
is the executor of his will. Now,
as Kennedy's replacement in the
Senate, he is charged with trying
to complete his late friend's legacy
by passing health care reform.
Massachusetts Gov. Deval Pat-
rick tapped the former chairman
of the Democratic National Com-
mittee yesterday to hold Ken-
nedy's seat until a special election
Jan. 19. Kirk, 71, said he would not.
run himself.
The announcement came after
the Democratic-dominated Leg-
islature changed the state's Sen-
ate succession law to restore the
governor's power to appoint an
interim replacement. Republicans
went to court in a last-ditch effort
to stop Kirk from being sworn in.
President Barack Obama and
his staff lobbied for the change,
hoping to regain a 60th Demo-
cratic vote that would prevent
Senate filibusters from derail-
ing his top legislative priority, a
national health care overhaul.
Obama said in a statement:
"Paul Kirk is a distinguished
leader, whose long collaboration
with Sen. Kennedy makes him an
excellent, interim choice to carry
on his work until the voters make
their choice in January."
Kennedy's widow and sons had
encouraged Patrick to appoint
Kirk. Vicki Kennedy and Edward
Kennedy Jr. sat in the front row

next to Kirk's wife, Gail, as the
governor made his announcement
at the Statehouse.
Besides health carePatricksaid
Kirk would represent the state's
interests in upcoming debates on
the economic recovery, financial
regulation and climate change.
"In all these and other ways,
Congress is debating our future
- right now," Patrick said. "The
issues before the Congress and
the nation are simply too impor-
tant to Massachusetts for us to be
one voice short."
Kennedy died last month of
brain cancer. Kirk, who has never
held elective office, recalled how
his late friend used to say rep-
resenting Massachusetts in the
Senate "was the highest honor he
possibly could have imagined."
"It's certainly nothing I imag-
ined, but it would be my highest
honor as well," Kirk said.
He is to be sworn in this after-
noon by Vice President Joe Biden.
The Massachusetts Republican
Party went to a Boston court
seeking an injunction to stop
Kirk's swearing-in, questioning
an emergency power the governor
invoked in naming him.
In restoring the governor's
power to appoint an interim sena-
tor, lawmakers declined to have it
go into effect immediately, rather
than after the standard 90 days.
The governor has the power to
put the law into effect if he deems
it an emergency; Republicans say
this law does not qualify.
State Secretary William F. Gal-
vin said the power to make the
immediate appointment is "very
clearly available" to governors
and was used more than a dozen
times by Patrick's Republican pre-
decessor, Mitt Romney. The court
set a hearing for 8 a.m. today.

Anarchists say police
denied their right to
peaceably assemble
PITTSBURGH (AP) - Police
fired canisters of pepper spray
and smoke at marchers protesting
the Group of 20 summit yesterday
after anarchists responded to calls
to disperse by rolling trash bins
and throwing rocks.
The march turned chaotic at
just about the time that Presi-
dent Barack Obama and first lady
Michelle Obama arrived for a
meeting with leaders of the world's
major economies.
The clashes began after hun-
dreds of protesters, many advo-
cating against capitalism, tried to
march from an outlying neigh-
borhood toward the convention
center where the summit is being
held.
The protesters banged on
drums and chanted "Ain't no
power like the power of the
people, 'cause the power of the
people don't stop."
The marchers included small
groups of self-described anar-
chists,some wearing dark clothes
and bandanas and carrying black
flags. Others wore helmets and
safety goggles.
One banner read, "No borders,
no thanks," another, "No hope in
capitalism." A few minutes into
the march, protesters unfurled a
large banner reading "NO BAIL-
OUT NO CAPITALISM" with an
encircled "A," a recognized sign
of anarchists.
The marchers did not have a
permit and, after a few blocks,
police declared it an unlaw-
ful assembly. They played an
announcement over a loudspeak-
er telling people to leave or face
arrest and then police in riot gear
moved in to break it up.
Protesters split into smaller
groups. Some rolled large metal
trash bins toward police, and
a man in a black hooded sweat

Protesters broke windows in a

Officers fired pepper spray

and smoke at the protesters. Some
of those exposed to the pepper

that their eyes were watering and
stinging.
Police were planning a news
conference to discuss their

ing away a handful of protesters
in cuffs.
About an hour after the clashes
started, the police and protesters
were at a standoff. Police sealed
off main thoroughfares to down-

Twenty-one-year-old Stephon
Boatwright, of Syracuse, N.Y.,
wore a mask of English anarchist

legged near the officers, telling
them to let the protesters through

and to join their cause.
"You're actively suppressing us.
I know you want to move," Boat-
wright yelled, to applause from the
protesters gathered around him.
Protesters complained that the
march had been peaceful and that
police were trampling on their
right to assemble.
"We were barely even protest-

City Council should stop delays and vote on plastic bag ban

- atleasttemporarily. TheAnnArbor City Council decided
at a meeting on Tuesday to put the vote to ban plastic bags
on hold until later this year, arguing that enough details weren't
known. If it ever makes it to a vote, the ban would be the first of its
kind in Washtenaw County and could set a good example for the
rest of the state to follow. City Council has been dragging its feet
on this important issue long enough: It must implement this envi-
ronmentally friendly proposal. But even without a ban on plastic
bags, students can still promote greener alternatives by switching

Majorly undecided

to cloth bags on their own.
The proposed ban on plastic bags isn't
new to City Council. It was first introduced
in June 2008, mirroring similar propos-
als and bans in cities across the country,
notably San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Tuesday's delay marks the third time the
proposal has been tabled. The proposal
would prohibit all retailers with yearly
sales of more than $1 million from provid-
ing plastic bags to shoppers. Because the
ban would only affect retailers inside city
limits, it would primarily impact Briar-
wood and Arborland Malls.
The ban's benefits are clear - plastic
bags aren't conducive to a healthy envi-
ronment. Plastic bags are made from pet-
rochemicals, which come from fossil fuels.
As more bags are manufactured and used,
nonrenewable resources are depleted. And
plastic bags take an extremely long time to
decompose, adding to Michigan's already-
overflowing landfills. As the bags do break
down, they leave harmful contaminants in
their wake.
Banning plastic bags has positively
impacted the communities that have done
so. San Francisco's 2007 ban reduced the
consumption of plastic bags by five million
per month. Similar measures have been
taken in Los Angeles and recently in San

Jose. Though Ann Arbor might not benefit
as heavily as these larger communities,
Ann Arbor's City Council should do what-
ever it can to encourage greener options.
Critics of the ban may say it will hurt
businesses, but this is unlikely. Because
the ban only applies to grocery stores with
a yearly gross of more than $1 million,
smaller establishments wouldn't be affect-
ed. And larger stores shouldn't have much
of a problem shouldering the monetary
burden associated with a ban.
In any case, there are plenty of more
environmentally friendly options to
replace plastic bags. Decomposable plastic
bags do exist, and though they are more
expensive, large retailers could afford to
offer them if they really want to stick with
plastics. But the best option is cheap, dura-
ble cloth bags, which can easily be reused.
And students don't need to wait for City
Council to opt for this choice - cloth bags
are already available with many larger
retailers.
The plastic bag ban would be an envi-
ronmentally responsible measure, and City
Council shouldn't have delayed its passage
again. But in the meantime, students can
avoid plastic bags on their own to create a
greener campus community.

At the age of five, I was con-
vinced I would make the
world's best kindergarten
teacher. By eight, I
saw myself becom-
ing a psychologist.
I was sure I was the
next Judy Blume
during my pre-teen
years. The past few l
years, I have had
my heart set on
becoming a nutri-
tionist. Just last LEAH
week, I convinced POTKIN
my friends I would
thrive as a wedding
planner. Now, I'm
awaiting my next grand idea. I can't
wait to see which quirky career I'll
pick for myself.
So, given my history, how should
I answer the most common question
that, as asophomore, I nowencounter:
What's my major? Honestly, I have no
idea what I want tobe or what I want
to major in. In fact, I assert my uncer-
tainty with pride, unlike many of my
contemporaries, who seem embar-
rassed to admit they're undecided.
Just because I knew what I wanted
when I was five does not mean my
19-year-old self can make any deci-
sions - at least not yet. College should
be the time when students explore all
their interests without the constant
pressure of deciding on their future
as defined by a major. I understand
that some people know what they
want to do with their lives and have
goals. Good for them. I still find that
the pressure to commit leaves stu-
dents quick to dive into a major they
may be unsatisfied with in 10 years -
or even six months.
Finding the right career involves
more than simply liking something or

being good at it. It's a balance of all
aspects of a person's life. The process
can only evolve from experience, and
unfortunately, I don't think my jobs
as a gym employee and camp coun-
selor can resolve my indecision.
Maybe that's because, to me, inde-
cision isn't a problem. I feel lucky to be
at a school with so many outstanding
programs. Idhbe cheating myself to not
explore as many as possible. Frankly,
the fact that Iwill - despite my reluc-
tance - still be required to eventually
declare a major pisses me off. If it were
up to me, Undecided would be a major.
People speak as if it is, and there's
nothing wrong with that.
I know that declaring a major isn't
the death sentence I'm making it out
to be, and I know declared majors are
subject to change. But if I end up tak-
ing classes solely to fill requirements
in a major I ultimately change, I have
wasted my time and tuition money.
And even the innocuous-sounding
General Studies major has its own
list of course requirements that limit
exploration.
To assist stubborn students, the
University implores us to seek guid-
ance from advisors. These advisors
are touted as seers with the ability to
assign the correct career path based
solely on a meeting or two in which
years of experiences and goals are
condensed and analyzed. Not to be
rude, but how can middle-aged col-
lege advisors with their own pre-
dispositions guide me when I don't
even know - or care to know - what
I want? Thank you, advisors, but I'll
gladly stay lost and un-analyzed for
as long as possible.
A word of advice for anyone inter-
ested in weighing different options -
I'm taking a class this semester that
I find especially valuable. It's a sec-

tion of Psych 211 called "Exploring
Careers." To be honest, I signed up
for it last minute when a friend also
in the class told me it was an easy
pass-fail class. But by the end of the
first lecture, I knew I would get more
out of this class than any other course
I'm taking this semester. The teacher
emphasizedthat today, it's far more
acceptable to be out of college and
not have a "real" job, or to have a
job unrelated to one's major. It's not
uncommon for people in their later
twenties to go back to school after
discovering an unexpected passion.
Students shouldn't
feel rushed to pick
the perfect major.
And that's okay, because I'm sure that
I'll probably change my mind about a
career even after I finish college.
This might seem like nothing more
than a rant about my indecisiveness.
But I've felt this way since my grand-
mother told me that she took her first
anthropology class during her senior
year of college and then wished she
could have majored in it. Naturally,
I took an introductory anthropology
course last year - sorry, Grammy,
it bored me to tears. But I now have
an overwhelming fear that if I get
stuck fulfillingthe requirements for a
declared major, I might miss out on a
class that could direct me to my true
calling. And that would be a major
loss.

Daily article on Halfway's
recent removal is one-sided
TO THE DAILY:
I am writing in regards to the September 15th
article about the relocation of the Halfway Inn in
East Quadrangle (East Quad's Halfway Inn con-
verted into student lounge, 9/15/09). As a former
East Quad resident I have many fond memories
of the Halfway Inn and am very sad to see it
change. While I understand many of the reasons
that they would move the cafe, I felt that the arti-
cle portrayed a very one-sided view of situation.
Where was the feedback from the students who
didn't want to see it go? What about those who
think it's a terrible idea to move the food? Based
on my own experiences, I don't think that this
article covered the true feelings of many of the
East Quad residents.

Good Samaritan policy will
not change MIP status
TO THE DAILY:
In regards to a recent Daily editorial about
the Good Samaritan Policy, it is pertinent
to mention that some information relating
to MSA has changed (Making the right call,
09/21/2009).
I would like to clarify what has been hap-
pening within MSA to make sure that interest-
ed students have the latest information. MSA's
Student Rights Commission originally sought
out the staff at the Office of Student Conflict

Resolutions to implement a Good Samaritan
Policy in the Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities. After meeting with various
staff at University Health Service, OSCR and
Department of Public Safety, we've realized
that the issue is much more complicated than
simply writing an amendment.
Changes in the SSRR affect only students
and have no governing power over DPS's abil-
ity to issue MIPs. Changing MIP laws is a legal
issue that falls under state law rather than
University policies. DPS officers are bound to
Michigan law, which states that if an officer
encounters an intoxicated minor, the officer
must issue an MIP or else the officer will face
consequences. With this information, we are
taking two routes.
The SSRR's Student Rights Commission is
writing an amendment to incorporate infor-
mation about adaptive conflict resolutions,
including one that OSCR has called "Alterna-
tive Conflict Resolution for Alcohol and/or
other Drugs" (ACR-for-AOD). We would like to
bring attention to this program because many
students are unaware that if they are issued an
MIP, they can clear their disciplinary record
with the University by completing an edu-
cational ACR-for-AOD program with OSCR.
A clear disciplinary record can be advanta-
geous when applying to graduate schools and
jobs. This program, however, doesn't expunge
an MIP. The Student Rights Commission and
other interested students are arranging meet-
ings with people to get as much information as
possible before we move forward to lobby the
state legislature. We encourage any interested
students to get involved by emailing MSAstu-
dentrights@umich.edu.
Vickie Hwang
LSA senior

Neil Marcus, a prominent poet,
artist and activist for dis-
ability culture, told the New
River Free Press in
2006, "Accessibil-
ity means you feel
okay about being in
a place." Fighting
against segrega-
tion has been one
of Marcus' greatest
challenges. Every
day, he must ques- MATTHEW
tion whether he isH
welcome in public HUNTER
despite incidents
that keep him from
simply feeling okay at school, work,
restaurants - even, until the recent
renovations, in the Big House. Since he
was eight, Marcus has been disabled
with general dystonia, a neurologi-
cal movement disorder that causes,
among other things, twisting body
movements and abnormal postures.
I met Marcus on Tuesday at a dis-
ability culture workshop. Shamefully,
I admit that I initially questioned his
intelligence and ability to commu-
nicate because he was so "severely"
abnormal. Naturally, I equated dis-
ability with a lesser intelligence than
my own. But Neil quickly taught me
otherwise. His unique movement
patterns are not bizarre - they are
elegant. His words are always accom-
panied by awarm smile. And he does
not, for asecond, wantyour pity. After
a few hours with Marcus, I realized
that I was in the presence of someone
who could be a great civil rights icon
like Dr. King or Rosa Parks, only Mar-
cus' struggle focuses on something
different.
On April 5, 1977, disabled people
led a protest at the San Francisco
offices of the Health, Education and
Welfare Department after Secretary
Joseph Califano refused to sign regu-
lations for Section 504, a civil rights
law that prohibits discrimination
against individuals with disabilities

by providing equal access to educa-
tion. It was one of the longest sit-ins
in U.S. history, lasting 25 days. One
group that made this courageous act
possible was the Black Panthers, who
protested and helped provide food for
others in the protest.
The Black Panthers are better
known for their unforgiving black
civil rights activism. But here, they
fought for equality for another
oppressed group - the disabled. They
were fighting together for access and
to feel okay in social space. This is the
struggle of minorities, women and
gays. This is what I, as a black man,
must consider daily: whether or not I
have equal access in social space.
I never realized it was a function
of my privilege to be physically able
to walk up the steps of Angel Hall,
just as whites often do not realize
that it is a function of their privilege
to rarely have to consider their race's
effect on social legitimacy or to be a
part of a student population propor-
tional to that of the nation. As white
civil rights activist Tim Wise put it,
"White privilege is being able to be a
gun enthusiast and not make people
immediately scared of you. ... White
privilege is being able to claim your
experience as a POW has anything at
all to do with your fitness for presi-
dent, while being black and experi-
encing racism is, as Sarah Palin puts
it, a 'light' burden. ... White privilege
is, in short, the problem."
What lessons can be learned from
Marcus and the disability movement?
First, we should all recognize our
own privilege and how it oppresses
others. My own privilege enabled me
to associate disabilities with incom-
petence, as white privilege enables
some to associate blacks with lesser
intelligence and violence. The looks
on some students' faces when I open
my mouth and I speak "standard Eng-
lish" never fail to amuse me.
Second, coalitionsarevitaltoestab-
lishing civil equality. This means that

blacks should be on the front lines
combating homophobia, men should
be self-identified feminists and Palin
should befriend minorities from
Detroit. Whites should learn to bet-
ter identify racial injustices and find
ways to openly discuss and combat
these issues.
Third, movements are more effec-
tive when a variety of people are
involved. You don't have to be Tim
Wise at a podium or Huey Newton
toting a machine gun to fight for civil
rights. Attending race forums, having
civil rights conversations and calling
your representative to tell them that
a six percent African-American stu-
dent population is just not enough are
all instrumental steps for change.
Disabled people
continue to fight
for civil rights.
Only 30 minutes after meeting
Neil, I helped him eat a turkey sand-
wich from Panera Bread, as he is
unable to feed himself. It was not an
act of kindness on my part - it was
one of sharing. While his hunger
was temporarily satisfied, I learned
lifelong lessons from him about my
own shortcomings and blindness
because of my privilege. Whereas
many describe Marcus' disability as
debilitating, Marucs will smile and
tell you that he enjoys the fluidity and
unpredictability of his movements.
Our common ground is in our mutual
struggle. We both want access, to feel
comfortable in social space, tobe bet-
ter understood, to have more equal
opportunity and to feel okay to be in
a place.

Not so scary Monsters

By MIKE KUNTZ
Daily Arts Writer
History has shown that super-
groups almost always look good on
paper. Too often
that's where they
look best - the
wildly inconsis- MonSters
tent results range
from breathtak- of Folk
ing (Crosby, Stills, Monsters
Nash & Young) to of Folk
head-scratchingly
awful (too many Shangi-La
to name). Today's
version, the markedly less preten-
tious Monsters of Folk - whose
tongues were placed firmly in cheek
when making that moniker - lie
somewhere in between: Fantastic in
theory yet still leaving something to
be desired on tape.
Monsters of Folk unites four pil-
lars of modern popular folk on this
self-titled debut album, namely
singer-songwriters Conor Oberst
(Bright Eyes) and M. Ward (also
of She & Him fame), My Morning
Jacket frontman Jim James (or Yim
Yames, as he has been credited of
late) and Saddle Creek Records' pro-
ducer/multi-instrumentalist Mike
Mogis (also of Bright Eyes). Their
idea to cut an album originated in
2004 when Ward, Oberst and James
toured together, collaborating on
I their respective catalogues in a night
billed as "An Evening with Bright
Eyes, Jim James and M. Ward."
Even with such prolific and indi-
vidualized songwriters as Oberst,
James and Ward, the album is
remarkably cohesive. Like the folk
supergroups of yore, each artist has
a handful of songs that are clearly
his or her own, and employs the
other members to help orchestrate
the tracks. This collaborative ele-
ment allows for a thicker dose of
vocal and instrumental layeringand

verse formula. Adhering to the old
faithful structure, it's emblematic
of the disc's primary flaw: unre-
peatability. The first four tracks
are effortlessly endearing on the
first go (the fifth is a remix of the
title tune), but continued spins
can't coax anything further from
the band's pleasantly simple melo-
dies and arrangements. The most
vital attribute any release can
posses is the ability to expand and
flourish in a listener's mind over
time. Here, The Pains show their
hand at the draw, and endurance
and growth is sacrificed for fleet-
ing instant gratification.
The serious guitars (is it safe
to assume they're Jazzmasters?
probably) come out on "103" and
* "Twins," and the pair is much bet-
ter for it, even if their songwriting
sophistication level is no greater
than anything else on the EP. The
two songs survive on their strik-
ing sense of adolescent longing and
geeky punk vigor, but they're toss-

offs that don't deserve slots on a full-
length release.
The "Saint Etienne Visits Lord
Spank Mix" of "Higher Than the
Stars" is the meal's final course,
and arriving on the heels of four
immediate hitters, it's a dominat-
ing downer - long, dreary and
repetitive. But over repeated plays,
something miraculous happens:
While the song's comrades become
increasingly insignificant with age,
the "Higher Than the Stars" remix
matures into an intoxicating hyp-
notist that rides minimalism to the
stars. A smoldering slow jam, it's not
only a stellar afterglow, but it's also
the most novel - and best - song of
the bunch.
The EP may suffer from a lack of
replayability, but more disappoint-
ing is how little the band pushed
the boundaries of its comfort zone
throughout the disc. The closer is
the only number that could even be

considered a remote departure for
the band, and it's a remix.
With a start-to-finish knockout
LP already in their portfolio, The
Pains of Being Pure at Heart are
ready to upgrade their sound, and
Higher Than the Stars would have
been the perfect venue for The Pains
to take some chances. Instead the
EP is a fun spin, but it's a missed
Sweet, but not
risky enough.
opportunity. For the moment, it
appears the pains symptomatic of
being pure at heart are the same
as those associated with stunted
growth. Still, youth is youth; it's
better to be young and idealistic
than old and disillusioned.

For Saturday, Sept. 26, 2009
ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
Some aspect of your private life will
suddenly be made public today. You will
be noticed! The irony is that the people
who notice you will be bosses, parents,
teachers and VIPs - including the
police.
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
Because you have a desire for some-
thing different today, go someplace
you've never been before. Furthermore,
you want to learn! Therefore, visit
libraries, museums and interesting out-
of-the-way places.
GEMINI
(May 21to June 20)
This is a good day to take care of red-
tape details that you've been avoiding.
(We all do.) Drag out those papers and
get better organized. It's a beginning.
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)
Because the Moon is directly opposite
your sign today, you will have to go
more than halfway when dealing with
others. This is no big deal, really.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Give extra attention to health matters
and hygiene, as well as anything having
to do with small pets. (Curious combina-
tion, I know.) You want to get better
organized!
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
This is a favorable day for sports,
vacations, the arts, playful times with
children and doing anything for pleas-
ure. This Capricorn Moon fits with your
Virgo Sun.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Discussions with a family member
wilt be significantltoday. You might want
C 2009 King Feat

to spend time at home alone, puttering
around and getting a handle on things.
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Discussions with siblings and relatives
are important today. In particular, a dis-
cussion with a female acquaintance
might help you get a lot done.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Make friends with your bank account
today. Take care of anything that affects
your cash flow. This is a good day to
maintain, clean or repair possessions as
well.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Today, the Moon is in your sign,
which gives you a little bit of extra good
luck. However, it also can make you a bit
more emotional than usual. (No big
deal.)
AQUARIUS
(Jan.20 to Feb. 18)
Work alone or behind the scenes today
if you can. You need some peace and
quiet. Solitude will feed your soul.
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
Discussions with a female friend can
be very much to your advantage today.
This person might give you tips or put
you in the know about something.
What's to lose?
YOU BORN TODAY Many of you
have scientific, technical abilities and
interests. Or you perfect a particular
technique. Many of you also have more
than one career or vocation. You're ver-
satile! You have a great sense of humor
and a fine, logical mind. You're private
about your personal life. This year is the
beginning of an entirely new cycle for
you. Open any door!

RESEARCH REPORT
From Page 1A
the ratings carry great weight and
the report's findings have moti-
vated re-evaluation of programs at
many colleges in the past.
"If a program you thought was
great turned out to be 15th or 20th,
you often changed the leadership,"
he said. "But, generally, Michigan
has not aligned itself with these
(ratings), because we've been high
on the food chain."
On the steering committee for
the Division on Policy and Global
Affairs of the NRC, Duderstadt
said the forthcoming rankings will
be more objective than they have
been in the past. The NRC is fore-
going a reputation-based assess-
ment of departments in favor of
hard data.
While many have applauded
this more numerical approach,
it does have the potential to yield
surprising results, he said, hence
the anxiety currently being felt by
administrators everywhere.
"Institutions that were highly
ranked in the old way may find
themselves ranked much differ-
ently now," Duderstadt said.
The effect of the rankings on a
research institution's hiring prac-
tices, funding and departmental
evaluations has forced the NRC
to become more transparent with
its methodology, Duderstadt said.
But allowing survey participants
to become acclimated with the
new system has come at the cost of
a four-year delay in the release of
the rankings, he said.
Duderstadt said the increasing
anxiety surrounding the immi-
nent release of the rankings is jus-
tified given the current economic
climate. Institutions that lack sig-
nificant financial backing will be
forced to trim their departmental
costs and may look to the rankings
for guidance, he said. Moreover,
key donors are likely to be swayed
by the NRC's departmental assess-
ments.
"If it had come out two years
ago, it would have been treated
in the normal course of things,"
Duderstadt said. "But now it will
probably feed into some very diffi-
cult decisions that institutions are
forced to make."
Having seen three other releas-

portive and open rapport with
colleagues, faculty and alumni,"
Ulrich said.
Zernicke holds a honorary doc-
torate of science degree from the
University of Waterloo, Ontario
in 2008 and a Distinguished
Teaching Award from UCLA.
"He represents the whole
package," said Ken Warner, dean
of the School of Public Health, in
a press release, "Zernicke was
by far the best candidate. He's a
respected researcher with a most
impressive publication record."
Warner also said that Zernicke
"comes equipped with loads of
relevant experience."
With his new appointment,
Zernicke said his major goals will
include developing a strategic
PROMISE

Agema said he disagrees with
House Democrats' proposals to use
tax hikes to pay for the program.
"Before you ask any body to
pay anymore taxes in the state
of Michigan, be efficient with
what you have," Agema said. "The
answer isn't always just to raise
taxes, the answer is where are
we spending money where we
shouldn't, prioritize the spending
and spend it that way."
Democratic Gov. Jennifer
Granholm has proposed raising
$680 million in revenue through
increasing certain taxes and
reducing business tax credits.
Megan Brown, a spokeswoman
for Granholn, said the governor
stands by her decision to support
funding for the Michigan Promise
Scholarship despite challenges to
the budget.
"The governor continues to
support the Michigan Promise
Scholarship because it is our first
universal scholarship and as such,
supports the belief that everyone
should continue their education
beyond high school," Brown said.
"As far as today, we're pleased
they have reinstated it, but it's
just one step."
In an e-mail interview, Cynthia

es of the NRC rankings during his
time at the University, Duderstadt
also said there were merits to the
reputation-based approach that
the survey data alone will not
provide, such as considerations of
esteemed professors and research
projects.
"I don't know that this is going
to be successful," he said. "It's
going to have an impact, but they
may decide, after looking at the
reaction, to go back to the earlier
model."
University Spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham said the ratings are
an important tool for graduate
students looking for a particular
assessment of their department of
interest. But she said that the NRC
rankings are only one part of a big-
ger picture.
"(The rating) is one of the ele-
ments of choosing a graduate
school, but, more important is
choosing the right graduate school
for the right person," she said.
Cunningham said compatibility
with departmental faculty, poten-
tial colleagues and research proj-
ects - all things that would also
factor into a pre-doctoral student's
school choice - is outside the
scope of the rankings. The same,
she said, is true of the University's
overall approach to education and
research.
"Interdisciplinary teaching
is huge for us, and I don't think
that is covered in the ratings," she
said.
The large number of institu-
tions that subscribe to the NRC
ratings has caused some universi-
ties to re-evaluate their research
activity and to set an explicit goal
of improving their ranking.
As a result, changes have been
made in the hiring practices, ten-
ure and overall evaluation of facul-
ty research, according to one paper

Russian president
opens door to
agreement after U.S.
missile shield deal
NEW YORK (AP) - A unified
U.S.-Russian stance on sanctions
against Iran would put added pres-
sure on Iranian President Mah-
moud Ahmadinejad to yield some
ground on his nation's nuclear
program.
Russian President Dmitry Med-
vedev opened the door Wednes-
day to backing potential sanctions
as a reward for President Barack
Obama's decision to scale back
a U.S. missile shield in Eastern
Europe.
While U.S. and Russian offi-
cials denied a flat-out quid pro quo,
Medvedev told the U.N. General
Assembly that Obama's pivot on a
missile defense plan long loathed
by Moscow "deserves a positive
response." Obama himself has
said his missile decision may have
spurred Russian good will as a
"bonus."
"We believe we need to help Iran

to take a right decision," Medvedev
said after the two leaders met on
the sidelines of the U.N. assembly.
Ahmadinejad has taken a softer
tone on many matters since arriv-
ing in New York for the U.N. meet-
ings, emphasizing his interest in
improving relations with the Unit-
ed States and expressing an open-
ness to include nuclear matters on
the negotiations agenda.
He has given no sign, however,
that his country is willing to bar-
gain away its nuclear program,
which he insists is for peaceful
purposes only. In an interview
Wednesday with The Washing-
ton Post and Newsweek, he said
he would be willing to have Ira-
nian nuclear scientists meet with
experts from the U.S. and other
countries.
In his speech to the General
Assembly on Wednesday night,
Ahmadinejad made no explicit ref-
erence to nuclear matters or pro-
spective sanctions.
Obama's chief Russia adviser,
Mike McFaul, told reporters after
the meeting with Medvedev that
there was no deal with Moscow on
missile defense and Iran. Pressed
further, he said: "Is it the case that

it changes the climate? That's true,
of course. But it's not cause-and-
effect."
A member of the Russian del-
egation, speaking on condition of
anonymity under ground rules set
by the Russians, said Moscow's
final position on the question of
imposing further sanctions would
be determined, to alarge extent, by
Medvedev's consultations here.
The U.S. and Russia are among
six countries that will hold talks
in Europe next week with Iran
over its nuclear ambitions. Obama
wants to reserve the possibility
of pursuing tougher sanctions if
those meetings lead to no restraint
by Iran in the weeks ahead. Rus-
sia, which has strongeconomicties
with Tehran, has stood in the way
of stronger action against Iran in
the past.
In remarks to reporters with
Medvedev at his side, Obama said
both agree that negotiations with
Iran are still the best approach.
"We also both agree that if Iran
does not respond to serious nego-
tiations and resolve this issue in a
way that assures the international
community that it's meeting its
commitments, and is not develop-

ing nuclear weapons, then we will
have to take additional actions and
that sanctions, serious additional
sanctions, remain a possibility,"
Obama said.
Medvedev told reporters that
the intent is to move Iran in the
right direction and to ensure that it
does not obtain nuclear weapons.
"Sanctions rarely lead to pro-
ductive results but in some cases
are inevitable," he said through an
interpreter.
Medvedev also mentioned that
his government welcomed Obama's
decision last week to scrap a Bush
administration plan for a mis-
sile defense system to be based in
Poland and the Czech Republic. He
gave no indication that his remark
about the sanctions on Iran was a
diplomatic payoff for Obama's mis-
sile defense move.
In his address to the U.N. Gen-
eral Assembly earlier Wednesday,
Obama stuck to his two-pronged
approach to Iran - acknowledg-
ing its right to the peaceful use of
nuclear energy while warning of
unspecified penalties if it veers
onto the weapons path.
"We must insist that the future
not belong to fear," he said.

Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg
hospitalized after feeling ill at work

Justice remained in
hospital overnight
as precaution
WASHINGTON (AP) - Supreme
Court Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg was hospitalized yesterday
after becoming ill in her office at
the court following treatment for
an iron deficiency.
The 76-year-old justice, who
underwent surgery for pancreatic
cancer in February, was taken to
Washington Hospital Center at
7:45 p.m. EDT as a precaution, a
statement from the court said.
The court said Ginsburg would
remain the hospital overnight,
again as a precaution.
Earlier in the day, Ginsburg had
received an iron sucrose infusion
to treat an iron deficiency anemia
that had been discovered in July.
About an hour later, she "devel-
oped lightheadedness and fatigue,"
the statement said. She was found
to have a slightly low blood pres-

Although an examination found
her to be in stable health, she was
given fluids and taken to the hospi-
tal as a precaution, the court said.
The July evaluation found
"that she was in completely nor-
mal health with the exception of
a low red blood cell count caused
by deficiency of iron. Intravenous
iron therapy was administered in a
standard fashion," the court state-
ment said.
Doctors on Feb. 5 removed a
small, malignant growth from
Ginsburg's pancreas. Doctors
found no spread of it elsewhere, the
court said at the time. Her spleen
also was removed.
She returned to work quickly
and hasn't missed a day of work
since. In March she said the opera-
tion had been "a complete, success-
ful, surgical removal" ofthe cancer.
However, she also said she was to
undergo chemotherapy treatment.

therapy for pancreatic cancer is

Lutz said he is confident that

"I think like anything it has to

Around the Nation: Harris and Best highlight the field

By ALEX PROSPERI and
MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Writers
NO. 9 MIAMI AT
NO.11 VIRGINIA TECH
Less than three weeks ago,
Jacory Harris was just the next
Miami quarterback trying to bring
a depleted program back to star-
dom. Now, Harris is ranked fourth
on ESPN's Heisman Watch, and a
win in Blacksburg against a Virgin-
ia Tech defense that gives up fewer
than 20 points per game will move
him even higher.
The Hurricanes and Hokies will
take the field as ranked opponents
for the first time since 2005, and the
game is significant for both sides.
After dropping its opener to
then-No. 5 Alabama, Virginia Tech
has taken care of Marshall and No.
19 Nebraska. The Hokies face just
one ranked team (No.22 North Car-
olina) the rest of the way, so if they
take care of business at home, a BCS
bowl game is certainly in reach.
Miami's schedule has the Hurri-
canes playing No. 18 Florida State,
No.14 Georgia Tech, No.11Virginia
Tech and No. 10 Oklahoma in their
first four games. But Harris and Co.
took care of business in Tallahas-
see and at home against the Yellow

Jackets. If Miami - which is ranked
in the top 10 for the first time since
2005 - beats the Hokies, you can
bet college football analysts will be
salivating over the Hurricanes -
and Harris.
NO.6 CALIFORNIA AT OREGON
Behind the legs of running back
Jahvid Best, the Golden Bears
look bound for The Rose Bowl and
maybe even for the BCS national
championship game.
Best rushed for 131 yards and a
school-record five touchdowns on
7.8 yards per carry lastweek against
Minnesota. He's behind just Florida
quarterback Tim Tebow in ESPN's
Heisman Watch, and with Oregon
this week and Southern Cal next
week, Best has a prime opportunity
to solidify his place.
Cal is putting up nearly 50 points
a game while giving up less than 14.
Oregon has been outscored through
three games after starting the sea-
son at No.16.
This is the Ducks' last statement
game for more than a month, and
they certainly need it. As for Best,
another dominating performance
could push him past Tebow.

ARKANSAS AT NO.3 ALABAMA
If not for freshman quarterback
Tate Forcier's promising future,
Michigan fans would have been
screaming at their TVs last Sat-
urday. Alabama quarterback and
former Michigan gunslinger Ryan
Mallett threw for 408 yards and
five touchdowns in a 52-41 loss
against Georgia.
Mallett and the nation's second-
best offense might have trouble in
Tuscaloosa, as Alabama has given
up just 45 points in three games.
On the other side of the ball,
don't be surprised if Alabama hits
the SO-point mark. The Crimson
Tide average 42.3 points per game
and Arkansas is allowing 31 this
season.
Mallett will either burst into the
national spotlight as an elite col-
lege quarterback, or the Alabama
defense will give Mallett a good
taste of the Bryant-Denny Stadium
grass.

KICKING OFF THE 2009 MICHIGAN FOOTBALL SCHEDULE

September 26, 2009 FootbM "

BIG TEN SEASON
Conference play is upon the Wolverines, and say
what you will about the league's recent success (or lack
thereof) - when these 11 teams start beating up on
each other, things always get interesting.
Many Michigan fans are ready to say that the Wol-
verines are back to their winning ways, but with Indiana
up to the plate and two road trips to Michigan State
and Iowa on deck, they just need to focus.
A bowl game is easily in reach - something the
maize-and-blue faithful figured out they couldn't take
for granted last season - but with the way Rich
Rodriguez has his team playing, our guess is that he has
his sights set higher than just making the postseason.

HIGHLIGHTS
There's a pretty good chance you won't recognize
Indiana's offensive scheme on Saturday. That's because
the Hoosiers just adopted the pistol, which was invented
in 2004. Learn more about the formation inside.
Greg Robinson is Michigan's third defensive coordinator
4 in as many seasons. But after 34 years of experience
in the NFL and college football, and a disastrous head-
coaching stint at Syracuse, he's looking for a fresh start.
It's best to know the enemy, right? Read about
members of the opposing team in our weekly Q&A
feature. Up this week is Hoosier quarterback Ben
Chappell.

Sept. 5 Western Michigan: Before this win, it had been a while since Michigan
fans had anything to cheer about during opening weekend.
Sept.12 Notre Dame: So charlie Weis doesn't like Big Ten officials. Boo hoo. Formal
complaints must be part of the five-year internship process or something.
Sept.19 Eastern Michigan: The Eagles put up a good fight in the first half, but Michigan once
again proved there's only room for one big-time college football team in Washtenaw county.
Sept. 26 Indiana: Wait, what? Indiana still has a football team? We'll believe it when we see it.
Oct. 3 at Michigan State: Well, hey, Little Brother proved he's at least the third best team
in the state of Michigan this year, losing to Central Michigan two weeks ago. Watch out,
Sparty, we heard Detroit Country Day is fielding a pretty tough squad this year.
Oct.10 at Iowa: Say what you will, Michigan fans - at least iowa pulled out a win in its
close game with an FCS team. Oh, sick burn.
Oct.17 Delaware State: As if Michigan students needed more motivation to
skip this game, the Athletic Department scheduled it during Fall Break.

There was frustration in that you
wanted to get good quickly, but you
just can't do that. It's hard to go
"poof" and to have the talent and
then have to develop it. It's hard.
Especially on offensive line - we
had to recruit seven offensive line-

go on and on. But the bottom line
is, it's a great experience. I liked
being at Syracuse. Good place,
good people. Treated me well, real-
ly did. Everybody has their critics,
but that's part of the deal. It was
unfortunate I couldn't get it going

It seems that throughout

bringing a staff together,

I did the same thing at Kansas

It's identical, really. It's important
that you understand in your own
mind, it isn't just about you. I'm
fortunate that these are three fine
coaches that I've hooked up with
here. So I think it's just important
that you communicate well, that
you're constantly trying to make
sure we're all on the same page,
and make sure I hear them and
hear what they have to say. That's
as much as anybody will ever ask
for, is "can we talk," "can we get it
on the same page," and have some
fun doing it. I really enjoy coaching
and I think there's a place to be able
to laugh and be able to enjoy your-

working your tails off. And these
guys, they fit the part. They're easy
to entertain.

Breakdown: IU's newfound offensive prowess not enough

BY RUTH LINCOLN AND

Thirty years ago, Michigan
and Indiana were tied on Home-
coming. With six seconds left,
Anthony Carter, a freshman who
would go on to become one of
Michigan's greatest wide receiv-
ers, told quarterback John Wan-
gler to get him the ball. He caught
it. The rest is history.
Michigan is now facing the
same opponent, also on Home-
coming, with a similarly cocky
freshman taking over the offen-
sive unit. Tate Forcier, welcome
to Big Ten season.
MICHIGAN PASSING OFFENSE
VS. INDIANA DEFENSE
The Wolverines are averag-

ing just 168.3 passing yards
per game, compared to their
opponents' 235. The Wolver-
ines' receiving corps is look-
ing much better going into this
year's Big Ten season, with
Greg Mathews playing well and
Junior Hemingway emerging as
a deep threat when he can stay
healthy.
Last week, Indiana had four
interceptions in its 38-21 win
against Akron. The Hoosiers
are ranked second in the con-
ference with nine sacks this
season. Indiana's defensive line
is feeling confident and is mark-
edly better than it was last year.
But this Saturday's game will
be the Hoosiers' first real test.
Against Forcier and Co. at the
Big House, theywon't pass it.

MICHIGAN RUSHING OFFENSE
VS. INDIANA DEFENSE
Michigan is third in the nation
inrushingyardspergame (270.7).
Much of that can be attributed to
running back Carlos Brown, who
lit up the Big House last week-
end with his 187 rushing yards,
including a 90-yard touchdown
run. Brown is averaging 79.3
yards per game. Throw quarter-
back Denard Robinson and his
fast feet in the mix, and Michi-
gan is lethal on the ground.
The Hoosiers only allowed 76
yards to Western Michigan, who
Michigan beat in the first game
of the season. The defense may
look impressive on paper, but
expect it to crumble when faced
with Michigan's deep arsenal of
running backs.

MICHIGAN RUSHING DEFENSE
VS. INDIANA OFFENSE
After holding Western Michi-
gan to just 38 rushing yards, the
Wolverines have allowed 167.5
rushing yards over their last two
games. Entering Big Ten play, it's
a statistic Michigan coach Rodri-
guez isn't comfortable with.
The Wolverine defensive line
should hold down the pass rush,
but Hoosier tailback Demetrius
McCray could break out. The
fifth-year senior is having the
best season of his career and
leads Indiana with 228 rushing
yards, including a 59-yard out-
burst against Western Michi-
gan.
McCray should be a test for
the Wolverines, butnothingthey
can't handle.

MICHIGAN PASSING DEFENSE
VS. INDIANA OFFENSE
In less thannine months, Hoo-
sier quarterback Ben Chappell
has gone from a mind-numb-
ingly bad backup to a legitimate
starter.
After completing just 52.3 per-
cent of his 155 passes last season,
the junior has shown marked
improvement. Chappell is tied for
fourth in the Big Ten with a 68.5
completion percentage. A lot of
that is due to Chappell's protec-
tion up front. The Hoosiers' sea-
soned offensive line has allowed
only one sack this season.
But Chappell needs some tar-
gets, and Wolverine cornerbacks
Donovan Warren and Bou-
bacar Cissoko have controlled
the passing game too well this

SPECIAL TEAMS
Special teams have been
steady for Michigan, which
is more than it could say
three games into last sea-
son. The Wolverines have

been able to catch the ball
and tally decent yardage on
kick returns (25.2 average
yards per return). Punter
Zoltan Mesko always gives
Michigan an edge on special
teams - his punts are flying
an average of 42 yards and
he is one of the team's most
consistent players.
Indiana's punting is solid,
but it has made only five of
seven field goals attempted
this year.
EDGE: MICHIGAN
INTANGIBLES
The last time Michigan lost
to Indiana at home, Bo Schem-
bechler was an assistant under

legendary Buckeye coach
Woody Hayes.
That was 1958 and the Wol-
verines lost 8-6. It's been a
while since the Hoosiers could
get things done at Michigan
Stadium, and it doesn't look
like that will change Satur-
day.
Sure, the Hoosiers are
3-0, but that's the beauty of
padding a non-conference
schedule. The Wolverines
have the opportunity to sur-
pass last season's win total,
and that should carry a lot of
weight.

excelled at teaching his players
how techniques relate across
schemes and in tying the play-
book together in their minds.
Watching the manner in
which Robinson did his job
made Salgado realize who he
was coaching alongside.
"When I came in the room
with him and we started prepar-
ing for what we were going to do,

I knew I was with somebody,"
Salgado said. "I thought this guy,
this guy is agood coach. This guy
is a hell of a football coach."
Perhaps itwasjust an instance
of a talented football mind
struggling with his first head-
coaching job. Robinson's players
were known for always playing
hard for him, even when he was
fired with two weeks left in the
season. Notre Dame was next on
the schedule.
The Orange upset the Irish in
South Bend that Saturday, 24-23,
with the last hopes of turning a
program around.
"I don't think we were far
away," Salgado said. "I really

don't."
After the season, Robinson,
58, looked back on the lessons
of a children's book at his final
Syracuse press conference.
"I'm going to read a little
story," he told the assembled
media, still looking determined.
"This is a story that Iheard when
I was young. And I suspect there
might be a few of you that have
heard this story. It's called, 'The
Little Engine That Could.' "
He drew out the main points
of the story, explaining each,

"I think I can. I think I can."
"Well you know what, I still

high school, col-
lege, the Cana- michdaets:
dian Football lysports
League and the
NFL. The Hoo-
siers jumped on the bandwagon
this season to open up some offen-
sive possibilities.
What is it? Well, that's a pretty
tough question.
"I have no idea," cornerback
Donovan Warren said on Monday.
"I'm about to go break it down right
now. I can definitely let you know
sometime this week."
It's called the pistol, a hybrid
between a traditional I-formation
and the spread package that Michi-
gan coach Rich Rodriguez helped
create, and it just might be the next
big thing in offensive evolution.
In the pistol, the quarterback
lines up four yards behind the
center - three fewer than in the
spread - and the running back is
three yards directly behind the
quarterback, which opens up sev-
eral options in power-runs and
play-action passes.
When run well, the pistol has
proven tobe anightmarefor oppos-
ing defenses. But Rodriguez isn't
going to approach it any differently
than he would when preparing for
any other offensive scheme.
"The pistol gets popularized
because it's kind of new," Rodri-
guez said. "It's like the wildcat
thing, but people that use the wild-
cat maybe only use it 10 or 12 times
a game, but that's all they talk
about. It's really just defending an
offense and the answers and things
they do scheme-wise."
Nevada coach Chris Ault invent-
ed the pistol before the 2004 sea-
son, and, as with any new idea, the
initial reaction to the quirky for-

Football Monthly. "When you have
traditional I-back teams where
the back is at seven yards, it's a lot
easier for those linebackers to key
him."
The Hoosiers traded in their
spread package from last season
in order to bolster the run game,
which ranked 49th in the coun-
try last year, and take advantage
of another plus-side of the pistol
- a dangerous play-action passing
game.
Since the pistol takes the best of
both worlds from the I-formation
and the spread, Indiana should, in
theory, be able to run the ball and
spread the defense out with the
pass much more effectively than in
years past.
Indiana has yet to fully grasp the
offense - it has run for a measly
146 yards per game this year and is
ranked ninth in the Big Ten in scor-
ing offense - but once the team
does, it could be dangerous.
"Putting in more of a power
running game definitely has been
our No. 1 goal," Indiana coach Bill
Lynch told the Evansville Courier-
Journal before the season. "Last
year, in the spread, the quarterback
was back there alone a lot of the
time and there weren't the oppor-
tunities to run the ball downhill or
run play-action.
"We think this formation gives
us a chance to do both of those, and
at this point it's so far, so good."
But Rodriguez is not too wor-
ried about defending the pistol, as
opposed to the other schemes the
Wolverines will see this season.
"I think the schemes are over-
rated," Rodriguez said. "I think
you just need to have a system that
has answers to problems you'll face
in various schemes and personnel.
... Most offenses have a variety of
things. It's not just one particular
scheme or formation you have to
defend."

run and play-action pass packages. The pistol offense was invented in 2004 by Nevada coach Chris Ault.


Q

i
a I

mation wasn't exactly positive.
"When I first introduced it to my
staff, they thought I was nuts," Ault
told American Football Monthly in
2007.
But the results are undeniable.
Since 2005, the Wolfpack have
ranked 33rd or better nationally
in rushing offense every year. Last
season, Nevada utilized the system
and dual-threat quarterback Colin
Kaepernick's skills perfectly, rack-
ingup more than 275 rushingyards
per game, good for fourth in the
country.
The pistol often spreads the
defense with three receivers and
looks like a passing formation. But
it's obviously the run game that's

boosted by it, especially the zone-
read, one of the most popular run-
ning plays in football right now.
The zone-read is what Michigan
ran during Mike Hart's career. It
allows running backs to find cut-
backs and other holes in the defense
easier, and in the pistol, ball-carri-
ers can see the lanes open up with
even more clarity.
Because the quarterback and
running back are just three yards
apart before the play - as opposed
to seven yards apart in a traditional
I-formation-therunningbackgets
the ball much quicker and has more
time and space to find cutbacks.
And, as opposed to the spread, the
running back is already running

downhill when he receives the ball,
so he can hit the hole faster.
"The beauty of the offense is that
if you're an I-formation team like
we were before we converted, it
fits into the same schemes that you
were running," Ault told American
Football Monthly. "You just get the
ball to the back sooner."
Ault also uses misdirection
and counter plays to confuse the
defense. Even though these plays
can be used from a traditional
I-formation set, the running back's
position makes misdirection even
more effective.
"The back is hidden; he's com-
pletely concealed by our quar-
terback," Ault said to American
