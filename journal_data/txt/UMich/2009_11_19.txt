The subtleties of a bathr oom sign

Lawmakers, University
administrators work to,
find new funding source
for popular scholarship
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
More than 45 days after the start of the
state's fiscal year, state politicians and
college administrators alike are still fac-
ing pressure from students and parents
demanding answers about the elimina-
tion of the popular, merit-based Michi-
gan Promise Scholarship.
In a series of interviews yesterday,
lawmakers and University administra-
tors discussed the future of the problem,
signaling that while it may currently lay
as a casualty of the prolonged budget
fight in Lansing, it remains a hot issue for
both groups.
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm,
who vowed late last month to continue
fighting for the program, made no secret
of her intentions in a conference call with
college media outlets last week. During
the call, she urged college students to join
together, "rise up," and push state legisla-
tors to restore the Promise Scholarship
program.
"We need students to know that this
fight is on and that we can win it and that
these legislators are persuadable," Gra-
nholm said on the call, "butthey won'tbe
persuaded if we're quiet."
As part of her effort, Granholm is cur-
rently in the middle of a campaign in
which she is visiting several universities

across the state to rally support for the
restoration of the scholarship. She visited
Michigan State University on Wednes-
day and is expected to speak at Eastern
Michigan University on Monday.
As part of her tour, a stop at the Uni-
versity of Michigan's flagship campus
was originally on Granholm's schedule.
However, a representative for Granholm
told The Michigan Daily yesterday the
governor's visit has since been removed
from her agenda.
In her call last week, Granholm told
college media outlets that funding to
restore the Promise Scholarship could
easily be derived from slowing the imple-
mentation of the Earned Income Tax
Credit - a move she said could provide
more than $150 million in savings for the
state.
Asked about Granholm's plan, State
Rep. Pam Byrnes (D-Lyndon Twp.) told
the Daily yesterday such measures would
only delay the problem.
"It's a one-time shot," Byrnes said of
Granholm's plan. "We've been doing one-
time fixes all along and thatreally doesn't
address the problem."
The problem is a daunting one. In the
final budget signed by Granholm, many
programs, like the Promise Scholarship,
were cut to help balance the state's bud-
get from a $t.9 billion deficit.
Despite significant trimming to the
state's pocketbook, projections for next
year's state budget already include a
$1.4 billion deficit - meaning more cuts
to state services will need to be made or
additional revenue will need to be gener-
ated.
As a solution to these budget woes,

LGBT leaders question
decisions surrounding
s sign outside of Union
;gender-neutral bathroom
By OLIVIA CARRINO
- ~ Daily StaffReporter
'A recent change in the sign outside of
i gender-neutral bathroom on the third
floor of the Michigan Union has caused a
bit of a public relations headache for the

building's administrators.
Members of the Michigan Student
Assembly's LGBT Commission were not
happy with the sign change - which
replaced a gender neutral bathroom sign
featuring a male and a female figure with a
family bathroom sign - saying they felt the
University failed to notice the need to have
a gender-neutral bathroom.
After urging from the Spectrum Center,
the family bathroom sign was removed and
is set to be replaced by a new bathroom sign
that will feature one figure; half male, half
female.
LSA junior Christopher Armstrong,

co-chair of the LGBT Commission, said
he was disappointed with the new family
bathroom sign.
"I think that we were just frustrated
to see it be labeled as a family restroom,
because it sort of made it seem like the
building had just forgotten the purpose of
why that was to be a gender-neutral bath-
room," he said.
Armstrong explained the purpose of
gender-neutral bathrooms is to create "a
more inclusive space for a trans individu-
al."
He said the LGBT Commission is trying

Former Michigan quarterback
in court for charges stemming
from a botched drug deal
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
Former Michigan football player Justin Feagin
appeared in Washtenaw County Court yesterday
afternoon before Judge Charles Pope to waive his
right to a preliminary exam for three drug charg-
es brought against him.
The preliminary exam would have presented
evidence to determine whether the case is wor-

thy of a trial. By waiving his right to the exam,
Feagin's case will now go directly to Washtenaw
County Circuit Court proceedings, set to begin
with a pretrial under Judge Archie Brown on
Jan. 6.
With the case now in circuit court, Feagin plans
to plead not guilty to the three charges brought
against him, his lawyers said in court yesterday.
Those three charges are conspiracy to deliver less
than 50 grams of cocaine, conspiracy to possess
25 to 50 grams of cocaine and conspiracy to pos-
sess less than 25 grams of cocaine.
Feagin's charges arebased on an botched drug
deal that occurred last winter, when Feagin
planned to obtain cocaine from his home state

SCHOLARSHIP MESSAGES

When students spot

A loss to Ohio State this Saturday
would keep Michigan one win short of
receiving bowl eligibility, but it would
not be the first time the Buckeyes have
kept the Wolverines out of the post-
In 1973, wheo the two teams met,
Michigan - ranked number four at
the time - had held the oumber one
Buckeyes to a 10-10 tie. Ohio State
Coach Woody Hayes admitted, "we
had to win this one to go to the Rose
Bowl." Luck appeared to be with the
Buckeyes that year.
.After the game, the Big Ten Ath-
letic Directors voted 6-4 in favor of
Ohio State going to Pasadena instead
of Bo Schembechler's Wolverines,
according to a Nov. 27, 1973 article in
The Michigan Daily. The coach was
stunnedby the decision.
Schembechler blamed votes against
Michigan on "ignorance (and) petty
jealousies",' according to the article,
adding that the schools voting for
Ohio State may have been acting on

grudges.
Don Canham, the Michigan Ath-
letic Director at the time, was an
unpopular figure with Northwestern
University officials after he played a
part in preventing the Chicago Bears
from playing at Northwestern's Dyche
Stadium, according to the article. Can-
ham had also upset Michigan State
University officials that year in a dis-
pute over television rights. Both teams
voted in favor of Ohio State.
More than satisfying grudges, how-
ever, Big Ten Athletic Directors may
have voted for Ohio State because
they felt that the Buckeyes had a bet-
ter chance of winning in California,
according to the Daily. Michigan's
star quarterback at the time, Dennis
Franklin, had broken his collarbone in
the fourth quarter of the game against
Ohio State.
Cecil Coleman, Athletic Direc-
tor of the University of Illinois had
announced on the radio that he
planned to vote for Michigan, accord-

log to the Daily. Following news of
Franklin's broken collarbone, he
changed his mind. He was quoted
by the Daily as saying that, "without
Franklin, Michigan is not the best rep-
resentative of the Big Ten." Michigan
State and Northwestern concurred.
Big Ten Commissioner Wayne
Duke's disclosure of the state of the
Michigan quarterback lay at the cen-
ter of Schembechler's criticisms. The
Michigan coach claimed that by shar-
ing the condition of Franklin, Duke
had had an unfair influence on the
vote, a claim that Duke called "totally
absurd",' according to the Daily article.
The Daily article noted that no one
made a serious attempt to learn the
extent of Franklin's injury, and Michi-
gan's team physician had not been
contacted.
Ohio State went on to beat the Uni-
versity of Southern California in the
Rose Bowl, while Michigan did not
play in a bowligame that year.

at fault for Katrina

A federal judge has ruled thatthe
Army Corps of Engineers' failure
to properly maintain a navigation
channel led to massive flooding in
Hurricane Katrina.
U.S. District Judge Stanwood
Duval late Wednesday ruled in fa-

Army Corps' shoddy oversight of
the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet
led to the flooding of New Orleans'
Lower Ninth Ward and neighbor-

GROTON, Conn.
Sleeping sailors
cause Navy ships
to collide
The crew of a U.S. submarine
made dozens of errors before the
vessel collided with an American
warship in the Persian Gulf, an
accident that exposed lax leaders
who tolerated sleeping, slouch-
ing and a radio room rigged with
music speakers, a Navy review
found.
Navy investigators placed blame
for the March collision on the sub-
marine's "ineffective and negligent
command leadership," including
what they called a lack of standards
and failure to adequately prepare
for navigating the busy Strait of
Hormuz.
The Navy Times newspaper
first reported the findings Sunday
after obtaining a heavily redacted
copy of the Navy's report through
a Freedom of Information Act
request.
A Connecticut newspaper, The

request and reported the findings

tive said.
Michigan authorities filed a first-
degree murder charge yesterday
against Jamar Pinkney Sr. in the

MEXICO CITY
Mexican state
passes legislation to
outlaw abortion
Lawmakers in Veracruz made it
Mexico's 17th state to pass legisla-
tion declaring life begins at con-
ception. then adopted a proposal
that requires Congress to consider
amending the constitution to out-
law abortion.
A majority of the country's 32
states have now enacted anti-
abortion measures in response to
Mexico City's legislature permit-
ting abortions in the first 12 weeks
of pregnancy.
Mexican states currently set
their own laws on abortion, but the
constitutional proposal adopted by
the Veracruz lawmakers late Tues-
day is likely to make the issue a fed-
eral one.
Under the constitution, a single
state legislature can propose an
amendment that must be consid-
ered by Congress.
Even pro-choice activists said
Wednesday that given the makeup
of Congress - and what they called
heavy lobbying by the Roman
Catholic Church - Veracruz's
proposal stands a good chance of
approval.

GENDER NEUTRAL

to increase transgender aware-
ness by posting signs on unisex
bathrooms around campus.
"People don't recognize what
they are and what the purpose of
them is, so having that sign there
promotes awareness of whatcgen-
der-neutral bathrooms are, why
they might be important to cer-
tain people on campus," he said.
The LGBT Commission would
like to see the family bathroom
sign changed back to a permia-
nent gender-neutral sign.
"The bathroom is set up as
a gender-neutral bathroom,"
Armstrong said. "We are just a
little hesitant of the fact that the
building hasn't changed the sign
quite yet."
The Spectrum Center, which
provides "education, advocacy,
and support on issues related to
sexual orientation, gender iden-
tity and gender expression, par-
ticularly as it affects graduate
and undergraduate students,"
also noticed the change in the
bathroom's signage.
However, Jacqueline Simpson,
director of the Spectrum Cen-
ter, said she believes the change
was merely "an administrative
glitch."
"The Union facilities have
always been supportive and are a
110 percent supportive," she said.
"I just really want to make it clear
that never was the administra-
tion trying to not have a gender-
neutral bathroom."
Susan Pile, director of the
Michigan Union and Univer-
sity Unions Arts & Programs,
explained how installing the
family bathroom sign was simply

on Creative Arts Project, said
that as a Michigan-based com-
pany - its headquarters are in
Madison Heights - Moosejaw
should be more in tune with the
region's concerns.
Heinen said she was particu-
larly offended by the portrayal
of female prisoners in the pro-
motional materials, especially
in light of a class action lawsuit
against the Michigan Depart-
ment of Corrections that result-
ed in an estimated $50 million
payout last summer to 18 women
who claimed to have been sexu-
ally assaulted by prison guards.
She said that in the photo-
graph from the e-mail adver-
tisement, a young, attractive
woman wearing a tight T-shirt
and hanging on to the bars of a
cell had a "come in and get me"
kind of expression.
"It has a very sexualized
vision," she said. "The ad per-
petuates the stereotype of the
sexualization of women prison-
ers as something that they want,
something they desire, when in
fact it's sexual assault."
University students involved
with the Prison Creative Arts
Project have made their opposi-
tion to the campaign known by
postingon Moosejaw's Facebook
page, sending e-mails, making
phone calls to the stores and for-
warding a petition in the form of
a letter to Harvey Kanter, presi-

a mistake during the process of
updating all of the Union's sig-
nage.
"The wrong sign went up out-
side that bathroom. There was
never any intent to change the
title ofthatspace," she said. "Since
then we had atemporarysignover
it that keeps disappearing ... final-
ly, what we have done is bolted
down the temporary sign."
Pile said anew, permanent sign
has been ordered for the bath-
room and should arrive sometime
in early December.
Simpson said that the Union
facilities got feedback from the
Spectrum Center in regards to
what the most appropriate sign
should be for the gender-neutral
bathroom.
According to Simpson, the
Spectrum Center chose a sign
that said "gender neutral" and
has a figure that represents gen-
der neutrality.
"It's just one stick figure and
when it comes down sort of half
of the body looks like a skirt and
then half of the body looks like
it's a pair of pants," explained
Simpson.
Simpson said the sign is one of
many possible ways to properly
represent a gender-neutral bath-
room.
"There are lots of different
ways that a particular identity
could be represented," she said.
"This is one way and so we chose
that way."
However, Armstrong said the
LGBT Commission does not nec-
essarily support the symbolism
of the new sign.
"The sign was a little bit offen-
sive just because it had one per-
son that was half female half
male," he said. "And that was just
a little bit insensitive we felt."
dent and CEO of Moosejaw.
Harris said she became
involved with PCAP in 2002 and
has remained actively involved,
despite living in California. It
was this continued enthusi-
asm that led her to "mobilize as
many people as (she) could to
get in touch with Moosejaw to
clarify just how problematic the
ad is."
Harris's main issue with the
campaign was the company's
attempt to capitalize on human
suffering to sell a product.
However, she noted that
Moosejaw has been extremely
responsive to all of the e-mails
and comments she has sent.
Wohifeill said the companyhas
"responded to every person who
has e-mailed and have published
responses on Facebook."
Moosejaw plans to move
ahead with the Jail campaign.
Wohlfeill said that while the
company changed certain ele-
ments of the campaign and
removed some shop signage
after the feedback started com-
ing in, they have no plans to
remove the ads or catalogs.
But for Weitzer, that might
not be enough. She wrote that
while she has shopped at Moose-
jaw in the past, she refuses to do
so again until the campaign has
been recalled and a formal apol-
ogy has been issued.
"I'll be happy to continue sup-
porting a community company
when it ends an advertisement
campaign that is destructive to
our community," she said.

PROMISE
From Page 1A
Byrnes said legislators should
look into larger-scale changes that
would more adequately address
the problem, instead ofpushingthe
problem further down the road.
"I think we need to be looking
at overall tax reform that would
require a ballot initiative or would
have to be passed by two-thirds of
the legislature," Byrnes said. "If
that fails you would have a refer-
endum, a ballot initiative, where
people would want to put it on the
ballot."
Byrnes added, if the program is
restored, she thinks the Michigan
Promise Scholarship may shift to a
need-based program in the future.
"Right now, somebody's family
who earns $200,000 versus some-
one whose family earns $30,000
- they're all entitled to the same
money," Byrnes said. "Because
our money is restricted or so tight
now, some people are suggesting
we should make it needs-based and
academic-based as well, based on
your abilities."
In a statement released yester-
day, Vice Presidentfor Government
Relations Cynthia Wilbanks wrote

that though the state scholarship
program has been eliminated, she
believes it is still possible for the
program to be restored in the near
future.
"There's always a chance," Wil-
banks wrote. "Discussions con-
tinue in Lansing on a number of
priorities that both legislators and
the governor would still like to
address this year."
However, Wilbanks acknowl-
edged that identifying a funding
source maybe difficult in the state's
tough economy.
"The key to bringing back the
scholarships or any other program
is identifying the revenue to sup-
port them," Wilbanks wrote. "Gov.
Jennifer Granholm and other elect-
ed officials are urging the public
and students to contact their legis-
lators to support a revenue plan to
fund the program."
Regardless of happens in Lan-
sing, administrators at the Univer-
sity say they are already planning
for how they will accommodate
student financial aid next year if
the Promise Scholarship is not
restored.
Wilbanks released revised esti-
mates yesterday that 6,172 students
at the University would have been
eligible for the Michigan Promise

Scholarship this year - of whom
1,984 demonstrate financial need
for the scholarship, while 4,188 do
not.
In an-interview yesterday, Pro-
vost Teresa Sullivan re-empha-
sized the University's commitment
to meeting the full demonstrated
financial need for all in-state stu-
dents, despite the Michigan Prom-
ise Scholarship's elimination.
-"We did cover this year the stu-
dents who had financial need who
had Promise Scholarships and we'll
just go forward with that," Sul-
livan said. "If you are a Michigan
resident, we will meet full demon-
strated need. We're not backing off
of that promise."
After finishing her comment,
Sullivan laughed and said it would
probably be more appropriate for
her to use the word "commitment"
than "promise."
More than 96,000 college stu-
dents across the state were set to
receive money from scholarship
program, which provides $500 to
$4,000 - as determined by a stan-
dardized test taken in high school
- over the course of four years of
higher education to offset tuition. If
the program had been continued, it
would have cost the state approxi-
mately $100 million this year.

Huffing and puffing
University shouldn't implement campus-wide smoking ban
tudents concerned about the looming campus-wide smok-
ing ban probably found little to be excited about at the first
public forum addressing the policy last week. Barring some
unforeseen change of heart, the University will become a smoke-
free campus in July 2011. Though the University should promote
public health, this policy goes too far in limiting the right of stu-
dents to smoke. Rather than subjecting smokers to a policy that
will severely restrict their lifestyle while providing little benefit to
overall public health, the University should simply enforce exist-
ing bans on smoking inside and directly outside of buildings.

We deserved a better grade."
- Christian Rodriguez, a 12-year-old student from the Bronx, noting the low marks received by his school, which
is disproportionately made up of black and hispanic students, as reported yesterday by the The New York Times.

Reckless advice for MSA

Announced in April, the ban will extend
the existing restrictions on smoking to
include all outdoor University property.
The University held its first public forum
regarding the ban last week. Ken Warner,
dean of the School of Public Health, led the
session and spoke alongside other individ-
uals representing the Smoke-Free Univer-
sity Initiative. One of the primary concerns
addressed at the forum was the plan to
enforce the policy. Instead of directly pun-
ishing those in violation of the ban, smok-
ers will be offered workshops aimed at
helping them quit. Warner was confident
that students will comply with the ban,
and that the policy will promote healthy
decision-making.
It's no secret that smoking and expo-
sure to secondhand smoke leads to adverse
health effects. For this reason, the Uni-
versity already has in place sensible rules
that prohibit smoking inside buildings and
within specified distances of them, as well
as on all'hospital-grounds. Theseare rea-
sonable restrictions that protect public
health, and the University should make
sure that they are being followed. It may
irndeed be r'ue that she areas surrfo-nidig-
buildings are in need of better enforce-
ment.
But banning smoking campus-wide is
overkill. The health benefits would be
negligible to nonsmokers, as secondhand
smoke only poses a danger in enclosed

environments. The health of the campus
population in general is not significantly
impacted by this ban, while smokers them-
selves will be seriously inconvenienced,
needing to either go off campus to smoke
or quit the habit.
But the University has no right to force
smokers to quit. That decision should
remain with the individual smoker. The
University can and should promote health
by offering free cessation workshops and
products to smokers who want to quit.
There's a fine line between promoting
health and requiring it, and a campus-wide
outdoor ban crosses it.
It's also troubling that no matter how
much the University insists that it wants
input from students, faculty and employ-
ees, it probably won't revise the policy.
Students should by now be used to the
administration setting up committees that
it never actually listens to, but that doesn't
mean it's right. The University should lis-
ten to the concerns of students, especially
smokers, and find a way to accommodate
them if it's really going to move forward
with this ban.
--~Tn their efforM tt promote health, Uni-
versity officials are acting like domineer-
ing parents to thousands of students and
faculty members. The University should
forget about the ban and instead make a
more concerted effort to keep smoking out
of University buildings and entrances.

uring my time as a columnist
for the Daily, the Michigan
Student Assembly has been
a frequent tar-
get of mine. Two
years ago, I wrote
about the crisis
of leadership in
the assembly dur-
ing the troubled,
scandal-ridden ten-
ure of Zack Yost.
Last winter, when R
assembly meetings ROBERT
were hijacked by SOAVE
people who wanted
to discuss unsolv-
able foreign policy
issues, I argued that MSA had made
itself irrelevant by failing to address
campus issues. I have ranged from
advocating new assembly leadership
to questioningthe need for MSA at all.
But this week, I found myself feel-
ing bad for MSA. And that's because
the University has swindled them.
It all started this summer when Dr.
Douglas Smith, a University profes-
sor, first contacted MSA about a vari-
ety of issues - among them, concerns
about the Department of Public Safety
Oversight Committee. The commit-
tee's purpose is to review the actions
of DPS, the University's police force,
as required by state law. The law also
stipulates that two students, faculty
members and employees must sit on
the committee, and that the campus at
large must elect them.
According to e-mail exchanges
between Smith and MSA members,
MSA was initially eager to talk with
him about the DPS Oversight Commit-
tee. But once his attempts to contact
various members became more pro-
nounced, the executive board sought
the opinion of General Counsel, the
University's chief legal consultants.
Here's the key: General Counsel rec-
ommended that MSA not meet with

Smith.
That policy ended Tuesday, when
Smith was finally allowed to speak at
an MSA meeting following a special
investigation by the Daily that found
the DPS Oversight Committee to be
in violation of state law. The Daily
reported Monday that the committee
routinely lacked student members for
months at a time, and that MSA was
appointing the members instead of
holding student-wide elections called
for by state law.
The fact that the DPS Oversight
Committee has been so dramatically
failing its mandate should come as a
disturbing wake-up call. How can stu-
dents trust DPS to keep an eye on them
when the body responsible for keep-
ing an eye on DPS meets infrequently,
reviews only a fraction of the grievanc-
es that are filed with DPS and doesn't
even have student representation
for half the year? The law mandates
that an oversight committee needs to
actively examine police decisions for
the good of the campus as a whole. To
neglect this committee is reckless.
But the only thing more concerning
than the state of the committee is that
the University has done nothing to fix
it for years. And this is why I'm feel-
ing bad for MSA: It appears that the
University essentially dropped its own
failings onto MSA by giving them bad
legal advice.
After all, the University administra-
tion had to know that the DPS Over-
sight Committee was in deplorable
shape and breaking the law. This has
been going on for too long for adminis-
trators to not know about the problems
with the committee (and if they truly
didn't know, that's an entirely different
problem). And once Smith began his
heckling, they had to be aware of the
problem. Why, then, tell MSA to ignore
him?
It's reasonable for the MSA execu-
tives to have been unsure about

whether Smith's concerns were legiti-
mate, but it's completely ridiculous for
General Counsel to be unsure about
them. The only explanation is that
the University knowingly told MSA to
suppress the view that the DPS Over-
sight Committee was seriously flawed.
Either General Counsel thought the
issue would simply go away, or it fig-
ured MSA would take the blame and
divert attention from the administra-
tion's failings.
'U' shouldn't have
told the assembly
to ignore concerns.
Now that MSA has heard Smith
speak, its leaders will begin looking at
how to fix student representation on
the committee. But will themore troo-
bling issue - the fact that the Univer-
sity misled, either deliberately or out
of complete idiocy, the student govern-
meAt on a matter of state law - everbe
addressed?
When the campus police force is
operating without oversight, we've
got a bad but fixable situation. When
student government ignores the per-
son who brings this up, it's a mistake
but maybe an understandable one. But
when the student government ignores
the issue on the recommendation of
the University's chief legal counsel,
what can we even do?
As MSA discusses ways to fix stu-
dent representation on the committee,
it must be mindful of whom it takes its
cues from.

A right to guns on campuS

Hey, liberals: Moderate this

Over the past few weeks, both the Daily and
the Michigan Student Assembly have come
out in opposition to Michigan House Bill 5474,
which would override a University ordinance
that attempts to make the entire campus a
firearm-free zone (Trigger happy, 10/26/2009).
The bill seeks to clarify the position of institu-
tions of higher education under state firearms
laws, and make them equivalent to other local
government units. Dorms, classrooms and
other areas listed as "school property" under
Michigan law would stay gun-free, but if the
bill passes, concealed carry would be permit-
ted on the rest of the campus in accordance
with state and federal law.
Unfortunately, the Daily's editorial is full
of the reflexive anti-gun sentiments common
among self-styled progressives. As a liberal, I
can attest to the fact that opinions on gun rights
and the Second Amendment are near the top of
the list of issues about which left-leaning folks
are content to unthinkingly follow. Otherwise
sophisticated people frequently claim as self-
evident the idea that guns are bad, more guns
are worse, and that anybody who thinks other-
wise is part of a moustache-twirling, shadowy
cabal devoted to preserving individual free-
doms at the expense of a peaceful society. At
the risk of destroying your mahogany-scented
fantasies about the evil gun lobby, I'm here
to tell you that it's not House Bill 5474 that's
"extreme and poorly thought out," as the Daily
would have you believe, but rather much of the
opposition to the bill.
The Daily attacks a straw man when it claims
that proponents of the bill argue that colleges
should not be allowed to establish gun-free
zones. It's unclear whether this position is
meant as a normative moral or legal claim, but
both federal and state law - even after the pas-
sage of the bill - will respect the rights of uni-
versities to ban guns in certain places. In fact,
as recently as the District ofColumbia vs. Heller
decision in 2008, the Supreme Court made it
clear that nothing in the developing Second
Amendment jurisprudence should be taken to

constrain laws forbidding firearms on campus.
The current debate is one about public policy,
not constitutionality. The debate does not occur
on the terms the Daily's editorial asserts they
do. Until the Second Amendment is repealed or
the University moves into a secured complex
that isn't open to the public, the fantasyland
gun-free school zone will never exist.
The editorial also uses the popular tac-
tic of conjuring up doomsday scenarios and
characterizing them as the inevitable result
of allowing campus to carry guns. The only
likely result from the passage of the bill, as the
Daily asserts, "is that more danger will be cre-
ated due to accidental shootings." Once again,
when we peel back the confident rhetoric we
find a hollow core of false pronouncements
grounded in a belief that more guns equals
more violence.
In fact, more than a handful of states across
the country already allow concealed campus
carry by students and faculty - in Utah, this
even includes dorm rooms. And yet, there is
little evidence of illegal conduct by permit
holders, let alone the trigger-happy Armaged-
don that some are predicting will come after
the passage of Michigan's comparatively more
restrictive bill. As Second Amendment scholar
Dave Kopel points out throughout his work
on the subject, licensed gun owners are more
law-abiding than the general population. This
is not to say there can't be a persuasive argu-
ment made for restrictions, but rather that the
empirical data doesn't support the scenario
that the Daily outlines. In fact, there's some
evidence to suggest that violent criminals
might even be deterred by the increased pres-
ence of armed citizens on campus.
The sooner we can have a debate about gun
rights that isn't pitched as a choice between
fictional gun-free communities and noontime
shootouts on the Diag, the sooner we'll be able
to talk honestly about the best ways to keep our
community safe.

t's been tough to be a conserva-
tive lately. I turn on the news and
see devout praise for President
Barack Obama and
barefaced vitriol
for former Alas-
kan Gov. Sarah
Palin. I read The -
Michigan Daily
and discover Col-
lege Republicans at
the University are
in disarray after
the resignation of a CHRIS
centrist chairman. KOSLOWSKI
And don't even get
me started on most
professors. Every-
where I turn, it seems something
manages to remind me that the GOP
has no direction, no leadership and no
chance of regaining power.
A solution bubbling up from
many pundits and leaders on the
right is moderation. They argue for
the Republican Party's moderniza-
tion through the adoption of more
progressive values. The country is
headed left, they say. To survive,
Republicans should loosen their ties
to the past and strive to land the
support of America's moderate and
undecided voters. The era of Reagan
is dead, and the conservative move-
ment must be redefined.
There's no way to sugarcoat what I
think about this. It is undoubtedly, 100
percent, indisputably wrong. A large,
organized move to moderate the GOP
would end the party as we know it and
then go on to wipe Republicans off the
political map entirely. Betraying the
strong, organized, spirited voice of its
conservative core would be the worst
move the party could make.
Liberals have my utmost respect
in one very important facet of their
psyches. When arguing core beliefs,
rarely will a liberal submit to mod-
eration. If you ask a progressive about
health care, abortion, gay marriage

or global warming, chances are high
that person will be unwilling to give
much ground. Compromise on these
issues would be in direct violation of
what they believe is right. How can
you compromise on a woman's right
to her body or the right of two people.
to enter into a matrimony recognized
by the state? The majority of liber-
als whose ideas I have read or heard
attack these issues with a heartfelt
drive and refuse to rest until what
they believe comes to fruition.
if you ask me, it isn't Obama's cha-
risma, some catchy buzzwords or
even hatred of George W. Bush that
is driving the current Democrat wave
of power. It's the party's relentless
ambition to push their values. "Hope"
and "change" mean nothing, superfi-
cially, but underneath they represent
a movement unwilling to accept any-
thing but victory.
Some suggest the GOP should com-
bat the Democrats by adopting more
progressive values in an effort to lure
centrists not totally sold on the left's
agenda. This makes absolutely no
sense to me. With Obama and a host
of other liberal superstars on one side
of the ticket, why would anyone be
tempted to vote for Democrat Lite?
In fact, Republicans have already
tried to put a moderate candidate
in the White House, and they failed
miserably. If anyone was going to
lure moderate voters as moderates to
the Republican side, it was Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.). Onewouldbehard-
pressed to find a voice in Washington
more dedicated to bipartisanship.
McCain co-sponsored Congressional
legislation with Democratic Senators
Ted Kennedy, Joe Lieberman and
Russell Feingold. McCain proudly
stood by his "maverick" moniker
given to him by the media as a symbol
of his unwillingness to let party poli-
tics stand in his way.
The maverick lost to Obama, acan-
didate who promised bipartisanship

- as long as it was the Republicans
who were compromising. For Obama
and most Democrats, bipartisanship
means moderates and Republicans
caving to the liberal will. Need evi-
dence? Look at the reaction to the Stu-
pak Amendment in the recent House
health care bill. Democrat leaders
included the amendment, which bans
federal health insurance from cover-
ing abortions, to garner support of a
few moderatevoters. Rather thangra-
ciously accepting this miniscule revi-
sion to a massive bill that is almost
void of conservative input, many on
the left chastised Stupak and House
leaders supporting such a disturbing
change.
GOP needs more
conservatism,
not less.
I don't blame Stupak's attackers or
any liberals for sticking to their guns.
Bipartisanship in Washington is a
crock. Liberals have regained politi-
cal power in America because they
never wavered in their efforts to con-
vince the public that they were right
and the political right was wrong.
Republicans need to take a page
out of their playbook. Moderation
isn't the answer for the GOP. The
party needs to pull out all the stops
to convince voters that conservative
values are the driving force behind
America's success. They need to find
a leader who can fearlessly and elo-
quently communicate this message,
not to entice centrists and moderate
Democrats to vote Republican, but to
convert them into true conservatives.

The Greatest Rivalry in Sport
The Victors!

From the Editor: We hope you're
enjoying our look back at the Dai-
ly's game coverage from famous
Michigan-Ohio State games. The
Wolverines topped OSU in 1997 en
route to a National Championship.
By ALAN GOLDENBACH
Former Daily Sports Editor
Charles Woodson's grin
stretched longer than usual, even
for the confident All-American.
It seemed to extend from end
zone to end zone at Michigan
Stadium.
And in the middle of Wood-
son's mouth was a sweet symbol
of perfection - a rose.
"It just doesn't get any better
than this," said Woodson, sport-
ing a fresh, bright-white "1997
Big Ten Champions" cap.
So stately was the rose, yet so
simple was the message.
Michigan's 20-14 victory over
Ohio State on Saturday conclud-
ed the Wolverines' first perfect
season in 26 years and sent them
to the Rose Bowl for the first time
since the 1992 season.
A year of dreams culminat-
ed in a day of magic, which so
drained the Wolverines physi-
cally and emotionally that some
could hardly muster the energy
to describe it.
"I'm still emotionally out of it,"
junior safety Marcus Ray said.
"This is my dream: to go unde-
feated, beat Ohio State at home
and go to the Rose Bowl. That's
why I came here and that's why
my teammates came here."
Since first setting foot on
Michigan Stadium turf, each
Wolverine had waited for this
moment. No current Michigan
player had ever earned a Rose
Bowl berth, making all unsure
of what true euphoria felt like or
exactly how to react.
"I came back to the locker
room and we were celebrating,
and we sang 'The Victors,"' said
fifth-year senior Brian Griese,
who almost opted to skip his mIal
year. "I just wanted to go back out
on the field and be back out there

one more time, like an encore."
The fans who had lambasted
Griese during his tumultuous
career now embraced the quar-
terback with similar intensity.
"I just wanted to shake every
"fan's" hand in the stands. I
wasn't able to do that, but I think
I got about 50 percent of them."
Griese played through the
pain of losing four games in each
of his four previous seasons, but
he never gave up hope that this
perfect moment would come to
fruition.
His coach also waited patient-
ly. Lloyd Carr survived both good
and tough times as an assistant for
19 seasons. And when he finally
became a head coach in 1995, he
ignored criticism and pressure,
looking instead to the day when
he could call his team the best in
the land.
"For us, it's truly a dream
season," Carr said. "When you
can line up and play hard for 11
straight weeks againstthe caliber
of competition that we've face -
and never play when you didn't
play hard - that's the thing I'm
most proud of."
Michigan played hardest in its
mostimportantgame. Surethere
had been rivals such as Michigan
State and talented, intimidating
opponents such as Penn State.
But no team presented a complete
test quite like Ohio State, mak-
ing victory over the Wolverines'
arch-rivals an appropriate finish
to a season full of challenges.
"This is a big rivalry just like
Michigan-Michigan State," Ray
said. "The only difference in this
game is that Michigan-Michi-
gan State is like a neighborhood
street fight and this is like a
world war."
Now that Michigan has won
that war, it can stand on top of
the world and smell the roses -
the scent of perfection.
"It's lonely at the top," said
senior co-captainEric Mayes, who
was injured in the fourth game of
the season and had to sit st the
last seven games. "it's lonely at the
top."

CLIF REEDER/Daily

Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez is using tapes of Bob Ufer's Michigan-Ohio State game calls to motivate his team this week.

eDid Ijust hear a lii' Ufer

y grandpa, one of the
truest Michigan foot-
ball fans I've ever met
in my life, had gameday traditions
that I'll never forget.
A steaming pot of calico beans
that he some-
how managed
to keep warm
for the whole
three-hour
drive to Ann
Arbor, a couple
ice-cold Bud-
weisers, his
giant yellow ANDY
radio headset Ri(D
and a cassette
tape he'd blast
through the speakers of his conver-
sion van.
The tape was looped, and it
repeated Bob Ufer's all-time best
calls.
Walking across the Crisler
Arena parking lot yesterday, I
heard that raspy, half-gone voice -
the one that practically pleaded for
a Michigan victory for 37 years on
the radio - the one so passionate,
it almost felt like Michigan had 12
guys on the field.
Ufer's voice was wafting
through the cool, November air,
and it screamed, "And now Woody
Hayes is running out onto the field!
I've never seen anything like this

in all my days as a commentator!"
I hadn't heard that voice in
a long time, since my grandpa
stopped comingto games because
of old age. My ears perked up, and I
listened for it's source.
After a while, I realized it had
to be coming from beyond the
steel fences of Schembechler
Hall's practice facility. The Wol-
verines, who have been known
to play songs like the GS Boyz'
"Stanky Legg" before practice to
get pumped up, were listing to old
tapes of Bob Ufer calling the "Ten
Year.War" between Woody Hayes
and Bo Schembechler,
Let me repeat that - Rich
Rodriguez is blasting Ufer's game
calls of the epic battles between
Michigan's and Ohio State's most
iconic coaches. The man whom
many have accused of shunning
Michigan's great tradition is
using it to his advantage for the
single most important week of
the year.
A little Ufer during Ohio State
week? Sounds good to me.
For those of you who don't know
- and I'm sure there are plenty
of you, since Ufer's legacy hasn't
quite held the same test of time as
Fielding Yost's, Fritz Crisler's or
Schembechler's - Bob Ufer was
something special.
He shucked journalistic integ-

rity for his "Bo 'George Patton'
Schembechler scoring horn" and
an all-encompassing homer atti-
tude. There is still a foundation
in his name that gives back to the
Ann Arbor community. His grave
plot at the Forest Hill Cemetery on
Observatory Rd. is about 30 feet
from where Schembechler and
Yost lay.
"Bob Ufer was Michigan foot-
ball," former defensive coordina-
tor Jim Herrmann told the Daily
in 1995. "That's what he lived
and died for. I think he would
have liked being described that
way."-
And if Rodriguez is usinghim
as a team booster, then that means
the West Virginia transplant is
obviously doing his homework -
and clearly honoring the vast and
special tradition that is Michigan
football.
Rodriguez is a man that doesn't
like to dwell in the past. And Mich-
igan traditionalists, who revel in
the past, were immediately skepti-
cal of that. But that doesn't mean
the man can't respect and honor it,
which is clearly what he was doing
with yesterday's motivational tech-
nique.
And if you're not pumped up
to play Ohio State after listen-
ing to Ufer - "Oh the humanity,
the unmitigated gall!" - you'll

never be.
Since Rodriguez came to cam-
pus 707 days ago, he's had to field
questions about the Michigan-
Ohio State rivalry. There are still
skeptics out there that believe he
doesn't understand what it means
to be a part of The Game.
Rodriguez practically pleaded
with the media Monday to under-
stand that he "gets" the rivalry.
He told the story - probably for
the Sooth time - of the time that
someone snuck a "Beat Ohio State"
pin in his pocket.
"Justbecause I did not coach
,sege before, I dd iit pljy 4ere,
I'm not from the state of Michigan,
doesn't mean I don't understand
the rivalry," he said. "I understand
it as well as any coach can under-
stand it."
So, Wolverine Nation, can this
tired, old concern please be put to
rest?
You and I may never know what
happens behind closed doors at
Schembechler Hall. But one thing
is for sure: As Ufer's powerful voice
drifted across State Street yes-
terday, Rich Rodriguez may have
proved - finally - that he gets it.
This team is going to be plenty
fired up at high noon on Saturday.

Leadership is hard to define

eadership is often one of the
easiest aspects to see within
an organization, but one of
the hardest to define.
Vocal leaders, like last year's
Michigan men's basketball team
captains C.J. Lee and David Mer-
ritt, are very
noticeable.
You constantly
heard them
chattering on
the court, and
you saw the way
they interacted
with younger
teammates on NICOLE
the bench. AUERBACH
Even though
they led the
team, Lee and Merritt, both of
whom were former walk-ons and
split time with one another, didn't
exactly dominate games.
The year before, in coach John
Beilein's first season, senior captain
Ron Coleman led the team - but
not on the scoresheet. He averaged
22.7 minutes a game and just 4.8
points. Again, less than spectacular
numbers from a team leader.
This season, that vocal leader-
ship isn't as apparent as in years
past. But make no mistake - there
are leaders. Junior Manny Harris
and senior DeShawn Sims are the
backbones of the squad.
Thanks to Lee's and Merritt's
departures and sky-high expecta-
tions for the team, Harris and Sims
have been thrust into leadership
roles this season.
And that's exactly where the
Wolverines need them.
For the first time in the Beilein
era at Michigan, the best players
are expected to be the team's lead-
ers. And even though Harris and

Sims aren't the loudest guys in the
locker room, their ascension is
what's goingto keep the Wolverines
focused on and off the court this
season.
"It's one thing when you have
leaders kind of emerge, kind of step
up - like what we did last year,
myself, Dave and Jevohn (Shep-
herd)," Lee said. "It's another thing
when you have your best players
who are getting a majority of the
minutes, who are producing a lot of
points, just really key players, doing
that.
"When your best players can do
that and be the leaders, that does
wonders for the team."
It's not the production - like
Harris' triple-double and Sims'
double-double in the season-opener
- that shows leadership ability. It's
the little things, like Harris' behav-
ior duringthe exhibition game two
weeks ago. He was giving high-fives
and talking strategy with a hand-
ful of teammates. He was being,
well, more vocal than anyone had
expected.
Last month, Harris explained
that he has been a leader on every
one of his teams, but a good leader
doesn't always have to be a big
talker. If the team needs someone
to speak up like Lee used to, Har-
ris said he won't hesitate to step
into that role. As evidenced by his
demeanor in the season's first few
weeks, it looks like he'll be com-
fortable there. Sims was flexible,
too, saying, "Whatever the team
needs, that's the type of leader I'll
be."
The thing is, these two players
already embody the type of leader-
ship the Wolverines need. They
don't need to be yapping all game,
but their growing vocal presence

Senior DeShawn Sims is expected to be a leader on and off the court this season.

does help. Michigan needs their
points, their poise and their hunger.
"They were here when it was
really, really rough, and they were
here when it gotbetter," Lee said. "I
think what they have to deal with
right now is they have expectations,
and we didn't have as many expec-
tations last year."
But of all people, Harris and
Sims should thrive in this situation.
They've handled being hyped
recruits and targeted players.
And better yet, the two appear
undaunted by the media attention
surrounding this season.
"The biggest thing is being able
to see outside yourself, being able
to see the big picture," Lee said.
"That's what our seniors did last
year.... These players have the same
ability, because they saw what it
took to get us to the tournament
and win a game there. They know
what it's going to take to get them

back there and hopefully go fur-
ther."
All the ingredients for strong
leadership are here, and Harris
and Sims are finally putting them
together. Teammates and coaches
trust them. They know how to
motivate themselves and others to
achieve a common goal. And most
of all, they translate their talent to
other areas of the game, not just
what shows up on the stat sheet.
For the first time in recent years,
Beilein has turned his stars into
leaders.
"What's unique about those
guys is they weren't brought here
to be average players - they were
brought here to be great," Lee said.
They weren't necessarily brought
here to be leaders, either. But that's
where they're going to shine.

Paz's 19 kills help.
'M' in five-set win

AARON AWGSBURGER/Daly
Junior Veronica Hicks will be key if the Wolverines hope to hold off the Lady Eagles.
Blue hopes t build
on fast start tonight

By MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Writer
Mark Rosen had never recruit-
ed a junior college volleyball
player before - until Juliana Paz.
Last year, Terry Gamble, then-
coach of Iowa Western Com-
munity College, pestered Rosen
to take a look at the standout
Paz. Despite the risk, Rosen still
decided to take a chance on the
outside hitter from Porto Alegre,
Brazil. The decision has paid div-
idends - maybe even more than
Rosen initially anticipated.
Last night, Paz showed why
she's fifth in the Big Ten in kills,
grabbing a team-high 19 in Mich-
igan's five-set win over Michigan
State at Cliff Keen Arena.
"She had a great match, and
she's a great competitor," Rosen
said. "She played great last year
but has elevated her level even,
more this year. She's playing her
best volleyball right now."
The victory gave the 14th-
ranked Wolverines (11-6 Big Ten,
23-7 overall) a season sweep over
the Spartans and the State Pride
flag for the third consecutive
year. The flag flew in Lansing
in 1990 over the Capitol Build-
ing, and the winner of the series
claims the flag after each year.
After leading the match 2-1,
Michigan State took much of
the momentum in the fourth
frame due to Michigan's ineffi-
cient passing and serving, as well
as five attack errors in the set.
Rosen called a timeout with the
score at 17-13, hoping to swing
that momentum in the Wolver-
ines' direction.
But the effort backfired, as
Michigan State (5-12, 17-12)
pushed the match to a fifth and
final frame.

coming off a loss to Southeast Mis- The Wolverines can also expect
souri. The Redhawks shot near 50 to see another lopsided turnover

ratio. They are averaging 25 forced
turnovers through two games, and
are ranked fourth in the confer-
ence for steals, averaging 13 per
game.
Last time the two teams met,
Michigan forced 22 turnovers
while snatching 11 steals.
"If you aren't hitting shots,
you've got to get stops and we
have to slow down the ball," junior
guard Veronica Hicks said. "It's
great that we were able to get some
steals. We do a great job of picking
the ball up and applying a lot of
pressure."
Michigan has relied on Hicks
often in the last two games. Hicks
has been patient and allowed plays
to develop. She leads the teamwith
eight assists and 28 points.
Against Marquette, Hicks
limped off of the court late in the
second half, but the team did not
release an injury report this week-
end. Hicks had her leg wrapped
and examined.
After the game, Hicks said it
was just a cramp.
With Hicks healthy for game
play, she and the rest of the
Wolverines ran spark offensive
magic.

"We always talk about how
the aggressive team has the best
chance in a fifth set," Rosen said.
"It's a sprint. You don't want to
be tentative, and the last mes-
sage we give them as they go out
on the floor is to be aggressive."
According to Rosen, the fifth
set is a "roll of the dice," where
anything can happen. Since the
set is only to 15, ateam has a huge
advantage if it grabs a few quick
points.
In the final set, Michigan
never trailed after racing out
to an early 4-1 lead. Sophomore
Alex Hunt and senior Megan
Bower each posted two kills in

the final frame to give the Wol-
verines the victory. Even though
Michigan wasn't necessarily at
its best tonight, the Wolverines
found a way to win, and that's
what has Rosen especially satis-
fied with his team this late in the
season.
"We struggled a little bit pass-
ing tonight and part of that is
on Michigan State," Rosen said.
"They are very physical and
run a very tight offense. When
they're in system, they are really
hard to stop.... We found ways to
compete even though we weren't
passing that great and that was
good for us."

By CHARLES LILLY
For The Daily
The Michigan women's swim-
ming and diving is not too wor-
ried about wins and losses at this
point of the season. After the
Wolverines won their first four
matches, they faltered in their
next four with three of those
losses coming to top swimming
programs-Texas, Stanford and
Florida. But Michigan coach Jim
Richardson isn't worried about
the .500 record.
"Swimming is a funny sport,"
Richardson said. "It's not all about
wins and losses all the time. Right
now it's all about performance and
improvement. A meet in October
doesn't matter when February
rolls around."
With NCAA qualifiers selected
based on individual performanc-
es, a team's overall record takes a
backseat.
"I want each swimmer to have
the best opportunity to qualify
(for NCAA nationals)," Richardson
said.

The Wolverines have a young
squad featuring 11 freshmen, who
are still developing stroke and
strength.
"Even though we are young, I
am very proud of the maturity of
our swimmers," Richardson said.
"One of the things I look for when
recruiting is self-discipline. I am
not here to babysit. I want ath-
letes that have an inner-drive. My
swimmers know what they have to
do and they do it."
This Friday, the Wolverines
will get a chance to exhibit their
maturity, as they travel to West
Lafayette to compete in the Pur-
due Invitational. Richardson said
he wasn't as concerned about the
outcome of the match as he is his
team's continued growth.
"Our primary goal is to develop
ourskillsand haveeachswimmer's
performances reflect their train-
ing," Richardson said. "Especially
this early in the season, it is impor-
tant to train, compete, reflect, and
then make the necessary adjust-
ments to enhance our skills."
Even though the team is young,

they are led by senior Emily Han-
son, who competes in the distance
freestyle.
"I think we are a very tightknit-
squad," Hanson said. "Everyone is
committed to training hard every-
day."
And Hanson knows something
about dedicated training. This past
summer, she represented the Unit-
ed States National Swim Team in
Rome, swimming the five kilome-
ter and the 25-kilometer in open
water.
"It was an unbelievable experi-
ence," Hanson said. "I learned alot
and I believe it helped me grow as
a person and a swimmer."
Despite the team's .500 record,
Hanson and her teammates believe
this season can be a success. Senior
Margaret Kelly, who competes
in the 200-meter and 400-meter
individual medley, is also very
optimistic about the upcoming
season.
"This is my fourth year on the
team and I can honestly say this is
the hardest working team I've ever
been a part of," Kelly said.

By MICHAEL LAURILA
For TheDaily
Senior Ashley Bauer, captain of
the women's golf team, is one of a
kind.
Sort of.
If you take a second to look
at the Michigan women's golf
team roster, she's really one of
three.
Ashley has two sisters on the
team - Meagan, a sophomore,

and Shana, a freshman. The three
have been competing with and
against each other in a variety of
sports since a very young age, and
all three graduated from Grand
Blanc High School.
But there is a difference
between then and now.
"We were all on the same high
school team and there were only
six of us, so we took up half the
team in high school. But coming
here in college, you don't really
expect that," Ashley said. "There
are not too many situations
where there are three of us are all
together. College golf takes it to
another level."
And Ashley's job may be the
most difficult. As a captain, she
has to make sure that there is a
clear line between treating her
sisters as teammates and as fam-
ily.
"She has to have talks with us
as a captain and then as a sister,
so I think that puts her in a tough
position," Shana said. "But she
does fine, and we all knew coming
into it what we were going to have
to do. So far, it hasn't caused any
problems."
Added Ashley: "It's a tough
thing to balance. I think I need
to talk to them more as team-
mates and not so much as sisters,
because it's easier to get mad at
sisters."

The Bauers have the usual sib-
ling rivalries, but since they are
on the same team, they have a
common interest - winning.
"We always want to beat
everybody out there," Meagan
said. "We want to win, but we're
always rooting for each other,
especially since we're on the
same team."
With the conclusion of their
fall season two weeks ago, the
sisters have been taking a short
break from golf.
They will soon begin winter
training sessions as a team, and
the sisters also hit balls togeth-
er.
on the course, the sisters' dif-
ferences show - though whether
their favorite golf club is a sign
of their personality is still up in
the air. Ashley's favorite club is
an eight-iron, Meagan's a seven-
iron and Shana's the three-wood,
a more aggressive choice.
Ashley will be graduating with
a degree in business, whereas
Meagan isworkingtoward a nurs-
ing degree.
As a freshman, Shana is in the
LSA program and still isn't sure
what she will pursue.
"As far as what we're doing
here at school, there are differ-
ent types of things, but all very
similar," Ashley said. "Golf kind
of brings it all together."

SINGLE REVIEW
YEASAYER
"AMBLING ALP"
For its upcoming album OddBlood, Yeasayer aimed to create music its audience
wouldn't feel "cool enough" to listen to. On "Ambling Alp," this intention is actu-
alized - the dense mess of random percussion instruments, odd vocalizations,
crashing drum beats and lyrical synth loops combine into what could really only
be called a hip-pop track. Added to this funky base is Chris Keating (exuding an
enviable air of calm confidence) repetitively crooning that, "You must stick up for
yourself, son." This undeniable coolness will draw listeners into "Ambling Alp"
and force them to keep the track on repeat.

Giving thanks for celebs

Found Footage Festival founders Nick Prueher and Joe Picket have been collecting tapes since high school.
Pric ess ootage

The Found Footage
festival unearths
decades worth of
hilarious VHS clips
By KAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
Daily Arts Writer
The age of the VHS tape is
long gone. Hell, even DVDs are
being phased
out by Blu-ray Found
discs and direct Footage
downloads. But Festa
there's another
chance to expe- Saturday,
rience the joys of 9:15 p.m.
those jet-black, At the Michigan
rectangular $10
hunks of plastic
when the Found Footage Festival
rolls into Ann Arbor on Saturday.
Now in its fifth year, the Found
Footage Festival is a showcase of
odd, unintentionally hilarious
clips taken from unearthed VHS
tapes. Festival co-founders Nick
Prueher and Joe Pickett take the
festival around the country annu-
ally, presenting a brand new set of
videos each year.
As Prueher explains, the festi-
val arose from nothing more than
an amusing hobby he and Pickett
shared in high school.
"We found a (training) video
for custodians in a break room in a
McDonalds where I was working
in high school and it was it was
just so extraordinarily dumb and
insultingwith bad production val-
ues - it was like the perfect storm
of stupid videos," Prueher says.
"(Joe and I) became obsessed
with this video and started show-
ing it to friends and making our
running commentary along with
it," he elaborates.
It became apparent to the duo
that their discovery of a moronic
training video was not an isolated
incident - the world was littered
with bizarrely comical videos.
Thus began Prueher and Pickett's
quest to search every thrift store,
pawn shop, garage sale and gar-
bage can for discarded VHS tapes.
"Over the years we amassed
this collection, and five years ago
we decided to go on the road with
it and make it a comedy show,"
Prueher explains.
But the festival is more than
just a visual procession of video-
tape footage. Prueher describes
the show as a "guided tour"
through the anthology of videos
he and Pickett have found.
"We explain how we found all
the videos, putting them in con-
text, and during the videos we
talk over them, making smartass
remarks whenever applicable,"
Prueher says, cuing the trade-
mark humor of "Mystery Science
Theater 3000."
Examples of these videos can
be seen on the Found Footage Fes-
tival website. Highlights include

-- --

"How to Seduce Women Through
Hypnosis," an unintentional date-
rape training guide, the "Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers Fan Club
Video," where the show's actors
share their lives' passions and
"How to be a Real Man," a rebel-
lious teenager's path to Jesus that
includes the classic line, "Pearl
Jam - you're toe jam!"
One of the most memorable
videos, titled "At Home with
English," features a small, mus-
tached man attempting to teach
non-English speakers common
English phrases through wild
gesticulation and extreme enun-
ciation. Like most footage in the
collection, the only thing funnier
than the video itself is the story of
how it was discovered.
"We were in Denver last year
doing a show and we met this guy
- kind of a weird haircut, kind of
a weird guy, and he said 'I collect
videos too, I'll show you some of
my collection,' " Prueher tells it.
"We go over to his place, this
bright pink house in the middle
of all these suburban houses in
Denver. Inside, he's got pictures
of meat on the wall and paintings
of clowns - he was like the real-
life Pee Wee Herman. We sat on
his zebra-print couch until four in
the morning as he popped in tape
after tape to show us his collec-
tion - one of (the tapes) was 'At
Home with English."'
Another priceless piece of foot-
age was given to Pickett and Prue-
her by none other than comedian
David Cross ("Arrested Develop-
ment"). The 1987 tape, titled
"Video Mates," contains 90 awk-
ward minutes of eccentric men
describing their best qualities in
hopes of landing a date. For the
purposes of the festival, though,
the tape was unfortunately
trimmed to a more appropriate
length.
"We cut together our favorite
guys, our favorite moments into a
four-minute montage and we feel
like we've barely scratched the
surface of what's on that tape,"
Prueher says.
For burgeoning collectors of
wacky videos, tracking down the
best "lost" VHS tapes involves
more than just random luck.
"The local thrift stores are
sometimes the best, but of the
chain stores, Salvation Army i:
head and shoulders above Good
Will and St. Vincent de Paul's -
they just don't screen the videos
as well."
"(When Salvation Army) gets
a box of tapes, they just stick that
box right out there on the floor
and we're there to scoop it up," he
explains.
As part of their travel itiner-
ary, Prueher and Pickett plan on
paying visits to Ann Arbor thrift
stores before the show. So if you
see two men scouring through the
VHS tape bin at Salvation Army,
you'll know why.
In a sense, Prueher and Pickett

are the excavators of these VHS
artifacts, resurfacing comedic
treasures for new generations to
see harebrained creations of yore.
The tapes should also provide
nostalgia for those raised in the
pre-YouTube period of techno-
logical innocence.
Eventually, the day will arrive
when all traces of VHS tapes
disappear, but the Found Foot-
age Festival will simply adapt to
whatever technologies become
newly obsolete.
"Who knows, maybe we'll be
finding hard drives at thrift stores
in 15 years and mining stuff from
that," Prueher jokes.
In this period of rapid media
communication, people may act
more reserved on camera, quite
aware that they are living under
a microscope - a single recorded
gaffe can lead to millions of online
views before the sun goes down.
But Prueher isn't worried about
depleting his inventory of foot-
ages just yet.
"The production values are
getting slicker and people have
become more savvy, but the bad
ideas don't ever change. If people
with bad ideas still have access to
video equipment then we're in no
danger of running out of mate-
rial," he says.
Prueher and Pickett want to
tell everyone coming to the show
to bring any appealing pieces of
footage so that the founders can
potentially include the clips in
future iterations of the festival.
"We encourage anybody who
comes to the show to donate to
the cause ... we always love meet-
ing people and hearing the stories
of how they found stuff," Prueher
says. "That's how we keep the
show going."'

you hear that noise? The
distinct tween-age squeal
bordering between ado-
lescent mania
and unhealthy
obsession? Don't
lock your doors
just yet, there's
a likely explana-
tion for all of
this: The newest
installment of SASHA
the "Twilight" RESENDE
saga is opening
in theaters tonight at midnight.
As this celebrity-trash spiel
goes to print, lonely teenage girls
across the country are donning
their tackiest Edward Cullen
T-shirts and abusing Kristen Stew-
art voodoo dolls in preparation
for the much-talked about pre-
miere of"Twilight: New Moon."
Exactly why this series - which
documents a hilariously contrived
romance between a sparkly vam-
pire and an awkward high school
girl - has been such a monster hit
among Twihards is beyond me.
The only thing I am sure of is that
Robert Pattinson, the male star
of the series, will have to hire 12
extra bodyguards to protect him-
self from all the underage girls and
sexually frustrated women who
will attempt to pull off his limbs
to take home a souvenir from the
film's red carpet premiere.
On the topic of media-blitz
tours, Sarah Palin is out on the
talk show circuit promoting her
"memoir," the hastily ghostwrit-
ten "Going Rogue." Can you
believe this literary extrardinaire
reportedly received upwards of
$5 million as an advance for her
underdeveloped musings and
insults? No wonder the publish-
ing industry is in such bad shape.
While Palin was crying to Oprah
and Barbara Walters about her
daughter Bristol's baby-mama
woes, Levi Johnston - the Alas-
kan hunk who knocked up Palin's
teenage spawn - was shedding his
moose-skin garments for a scan-
dalous Playgirl spread. It's amaz-
ing to think that a little more than
12 months ago this woman was
vying to be a heartbeat away from
the presidency.
Sarah Palin isn't the only Bible-
thumping conservative darling

HAIR
From Page 1B

in Iraq - and how these themes are
tied into the material.
"It's funny - when I first found
out I was going to be directing
'HAIR,' I got a lot of questions or
suggestions about where I should
set it," Wigfield explains.
"(People said) 'You should set it
in 2009 in Iraq and make the hip-
pies hipsters!' And I was like,'Well,
that'd be quite redundant,' because
I think as long as there's killing -
as long as there's a disturbance of
peace - the people are going to be
questioning that disturbance in
peace," Wigfield said.
"And it's very, very comforting
to know that, 43 years ago, people
were dealing with the same issues
- not necessarily the same situa-
tion, but the issues: choice, free-
dom, love, power, sex, religion."
The show's diversescoregave the
production team and musical direc-
tor Jake MClory, a Music, Theatre
& Dance senior, numerous options
with the direction the group could
take with the material. The songs in
the show are backed by a full band
and cover a variety of genres, from
traditional show tunes and country
songs to early Motown.
For "HAIR," McClory wanted
to maintain the best qualities of
the original score while simultane-
ously building something unique.
In crafting the score, McClory
adjusted vocal arrangements and
drew from both past productions
of "HAIR" and music from the '60s.,
"I've been lucky enough to work
with a cast that can jump from
genre to genre, a cast with such
unique voices that when they com-
bine and singtogether, it is incredi-
bly powerful and moving," McClory
wrote in an e-mail interview.
"I've loved having the experi-
ence to not only work on this show
but to familiarize myself with these
different genres - not many shows
use such a combination of styles."
With its progressive political
perspectives, "HAIR" has attract-
ed its share of both praise and,
most notably, controversy since
its debut. Besides its readiness to
flaunt numerous social and politi-
cal taboos, the show's first act ends
infamously with the cast disrobing
on stage. MUSKET's production
also includes a scene in which the
American flag is used in a variety of*
questionable situations.
This production of "HAIR"
makes full use of the group's flex-
ibility as a student-run organiza- -
tion, as well as the "14 and up" age
disclaimer placed at the bottomr of
the promotional poster. Wigfield
credited the cast for its willing-
ness to go with the show's riskier
aspects.
"It's incredibly encouraging to
find that the people you're work-
ing with are comfortable with what
you're doing," Wigfield explained.
"The audience might not always
be, but it's the chance you've got to
take."
Wigfield acknowledges that he
can't control how the audience
reacts to the show's controversial
moments, too.

"What I can control is how hon-
estly we support the text, what my
visual picture is when we look at a
scene and say, 'How can we bring
this to life?' " Wigfield said.
"And if that implies or if that
includes going to places that might
be a little shades of grey between
right and wrong, then that's a
chance you've got to take."
T he group started the produc-
tion process well in advance,
assembling the show's production
team in February. In the interven-
ing time, the team worked on vari-
ous pre-production tasks - they
choreographed dance numbers,
planned rehearsals and learned the
show's songs.
Once the team selected its cast,
the process picked up speed con-
siderably. The 19-member cast con-
tains a diverse spread of students,
ranging from freshmen performing
for the first time at the University
to upperclassmen with multiple
shows under their belts. The cast
members all share a love for the
form, and their appreciation of the
original show drew most of them to
the production.
"It's one of the few musicals
I've ever heard of that are not nar-
rative driven," said cast member
Brian Rosenthal, a Music, Theatre
& Dance junior. "It's not about the
plot ... it's just about these charac-
ters and their relationships."
Since being cast, the ensemble has
rehearsed four hours a day for six
days every week at the Student Arts
Theatre Complex. Their rehearsal
space isn't exactly the most luxuri-
ous place - the far walls of the room
are lined with mounds of props from
past shows and assorted shoes and
backpacks belonging to the cast.
There's ample space to run through
material, but the rehearsal is occa-
sionally punctuated by mechanical
whirring emanating from the vents
across the room.
The amount of content covered in
each rehearsal varies. Nights dedi-
cated to working on choreography
might only cover a few songs in sev-
eral hours, while sessions devoted
to rehearsing scenes or songs could
cover significantly more material.
The work doesn't stop after rehears-
als, either - cast members often
spend time outside rehearsal going
over lines, listening to songs and
practicing choreography at home.
"Every moment of the day you're
not learning lines, they're simmer-
ing in your brain and you're think-
ing about it." Rosenthal said.
For the cast, at least, the dynam-
ic nature of rehearsal helps to keep
the process fresh.
"It's been demanding, definitely,
and I think one of the fun things
aboutthis show is that it's constant-
ly changing," cast member Lance
Fletke, an LSA sophomore, said.
"We get the first senses of the
music and the blocking ... making
choices in our lines and how we
present the show. And we could
make a choice one night that really
conveys the point and the message
real well, but then the next night, it
doesn't do quite the job that it needs
to do," Fleke said. "So, you change
and you morph and it's not a rigid
production at all."
Simultaneously, the production

staff handles a variety of behind-
the-scenes tasks, ranging from
running production meetings to
advertising. For many members,
the process behind assembling the
show has its own appeal.
"We have weekly production
meetings where everybody gets
caught up on everything," said
associate producer Kathryn Pam-
ula, a first-time producer for MUS-
KET and a sophomore in the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance and the
Ross School of Business, "Individ-
ual units are doing lighting, sets,
sound, costumes and we regroup
at this meeting ... and it's just defi-
nitely a team process."
But what keeps MUSKET's
members going through their rig-
orous schedule? Being a full-time
student is enough for most at the
University, but balancing, at mini-
mum, another 24 hours of work
every week can't help but seem
grueling. For most of the cast and
crew, it's their passion for the cre-
ative process that draws them back
every day.
"It's something that we all enjoy
being a part of. I mean, otherwise,
we wouldn't be here at all," Massell
said. "Right now, the show is my
life . even though we get frustrat-
ed with each other and there's ups
and downs in the process of putting
on a show, above all, I think we all
love beinghere and we all love each
other and we're happy to pull our
weight."
t's the first full dress rehearsal
the week of opening night and
the Power Center, MUSKET's cen-
ter of production for this last week,
is a far cryfromctheirusual rehears-
al space.
The building's 1,368-seat the-
ater adds an enormous sense of
scale to the performance setting
with a multi-story steel scaffolding
adorned with a tie-dyed cloth ban-
ner and band instruments sitting at
the center of the stage. The mood
throughout the theater is especially
energetic,withcastand crew mem-
bers milling throughout the space,
trying out costumes and working
with the lighting and sound.
Sitting in the audience and look-
ing toward the stage at the cul-
mination of months of hard work
from the cast and crew, Wigfield
can't help but laugh and enjoy the
moment.
"It's everything: It's extremely
exciting, it's absolutely terrifying,
it's beautiful." Wigfield says. "To
see the haze, to see the band on
stage, ideas from the beginning,
(it's) incredible. It's like getting
everything you every wanted, it's
like Christmas and birthdays, but
better and for 1,200 people."
The process is still far from fin-
ished-Wigfield admits that things
will get fine tuned until rightbefore
the first show - and as he walks
back toward the stage, what that
entails is easy to see. The band's
sound needs to get calibrated, the
cast has to cut down their entrance
time and countless other adjust-
ments still have to be made.
But considering what the group
has already done since they started
working on "HAIR," it's hard to get
too worried. After all, they've got a
show to do.

S E STEPHEN STILLS'MANASSAS' (1972)
Stills's four-sided odyssey

By MIKE KUNTZ
Daily Arts Writer
Double albums are notori-
ously self-indulgent, even if they
sometimes yield startling results.
The four-sided format allows art-
ists to stretch out and explore
more experimental avenues in a
way single LPs don't, but there's
often enough fatty trash that one
wonders why a consistent "sin-
gle-album" wasn't culled from
the hit-or-miss creative process.
Though a lucky few may be exempt
from the stigma (The Beatles' self-
titled White Album; The Rolling
Stones' Exile on Main Street), pro-
ducing double albums nevertheless
seems intimidating.
Stephen Stills's 1972 double-
album, Manassas, can be fairly
billed as one of the more under-
rated records of the early'70s - an
era many consider the glory days
of rock'n'roll. Consisting of band
leaders and principal songwriters
Stills (Buffalo Springfield; Crosby,
Stills, Nash & Young) and Chris
Hillman (The Byrds, The Flying
Burrito Brothers), the band was a
ragtag collection of session musi-
cians who had played with either
Hillman or Stills over the course
of their careers. The seven musi-
cians' chemistry was so strong,
however, that they even adopted
Manassas as their band name after
touring began in order to distance
themselves from the notion that
they were merely Stills's backup
players.
Manassas is technically billed
as a Stephen Stills solo project,
though it's often tough, to see
where the group dynamic ends and
Stills's influence begins. With its
