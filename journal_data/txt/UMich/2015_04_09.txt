Nearly 100 

students, faculty 
members gather to 
reflect on tragedy

By SAMIHA MATIN

Daily Staff Reporter

Nearly 100 University students 

and faculty members gathered 
Wednesday night on the Diag to 

honor the 148 lives lost in the al-
Shabaab militant group attack on 
Garissa College in Kenya.

At the candlelight vigil, which 

was hosted by the African Students 
Association, attendees held candles 
for 148 seconds of silence — repre-
senting each life lost — before they 
stood on the steps of the Hatcher 
Graduate Library to recite poems 
and speeches. Though the students 
believed the number to be 148, 
conflicting news reports listed the 
number of deaths as either 147 and 

148.

The victims of the attack in 

Kenya were mostly students. This 
was not the first time al-Shabaab 
attacked Kenya. In 2013, the mili-
tant group killed 69 people in Nai-
robi’s Westgate Mall. The attacks 
increased after Kenyan military 
troops were sent to Somalia, al-Sha-
baab’s base, four years ago to fight 
against the group.

At the vigil, many students 

voiced their concerns about the 
lack of media coverage of the 

attack. In a speech, LSA senior 
Olubisi Ajetunmobi, president of 
the African Students Association, 
attempted to personify the students 
whose lives were lost, reflecting 
on the trending Twitter hashtag 
#148isnotjustanumber.

“The students were brothers, sis-

ters, friends and loved ones whose 
lives were cut short by this murder-
ous act,” Ajetunmobi said. “While 
the world stands by and ignores 
what is happening, we need to 

University reverses 
decision to not play 

controversial 
film at UMix

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

After a letter circulated by 

concerned students caused the 
University to cancel a showing 
of the film “American Sniper,” 
the Center for Campus Involve-
ment will still show the film at 
its regularly scheduled UMix 
event Friday night, according 
to a statement by E. Royster 
Harper, vice president for stu-
dent life.

Earlier today, CCI announced 

the organization would show 
the film at a separate time, and 
the film “Paddington” would 
replace the film’s slot at UMix. 
However, according to Harper, 
the movie will be shown at the 
originally scheduled location at 
UMix, along with the alterna-

tive “Paddington” movie. “Pad-
dington” will be screened at 
another location on campus.

“It was a mistake to cancel the 

showing of the movie “Ameri-
can Sniper” on campus as part 
of a social event for students,” 
she said. “The initial decision to 
cancel the movie was not con-
sistent with the high value the 
University of Michigan places 
on freedom of expression and 
our respect for the right of stu-
dents to make their own choices 
in such matters.”

“We 
recognize, 
however, 

that some students are uncom-
fortable with the content of the 
movie, and appreciate that con-
cern,” she added.

The decision follows the cre-

ation of a student-generated 
petition Wednesday that called 
for the University to reverse 
its previous move to cancel the 
showing.

Before 
Harper’s 
state-

ment, CCI announced plans 
to reschedule the showing of 
“American Sniper” at the Uni-

talk changes to LSA 
R&E requirement, 

diversity issues

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

A Residential College mini-

course focused on the “Black 
Lives Matter” protests concluded 
Wednesday with a panel featur-
ing University President Mark 
Schlissel and Angela Dillard, LSA 
associate dean of Undergraduate 
Education.

Black Lives Matter is a nation-

wide 
movement 
started 
in 

response to multiple deaths of 
unarmed Black men in encoun-
ters with police officers over 
the past several months, notably 
involving the cases of Michael 
Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric 
Garner in New York. The mini-
course was intended to foster dis-
cussion both about the incidents 
and the protests, as well as talk 
about broader issues of inequity 

in the United States. It was open 
to faculty and community mem-
bers as well as students.

The course has hosted several 

other guest speakers, including 
Shaka Senghor, an author and 
motivational speaker, and Detroit 
activist Ron Scott. Wednesday’s 
seminar provided an occasion 
for attendees to ask questions 
and express their opinions about 
issues regarding diversity on 
campus, particularly LSA’s Race 
and Ethnicity requirement. Sev-
eral students drafted several pro-
posals to change the requirement 
last year, and the LSA Curricu-
lum Committee is currently look-
ing into plans to review it.

Dillard’s presentation focused 

mainly on the history of the 
requirement, as well as how a 
series of events last year, such as 
the #BBUM movement, provoked 
initial discussion about reconsid-
ering it.

The #BBUM Twitter cam-

paign launched in November 
2013 by members of the Black 
Student Union and was intended 
to express the experiences of 
Black students at the University. 

At final fireside 
chat, University 
executives talk 
future initiatives

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

Sexual assault on campus 

dominated 
the 
conversation 

Wednesday at University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel’s final fire-
side chat of the year.

During the chat, which allows 

randomly selected students the 
opportunity to ask any ques-

tions of their choosing, Schlissel 
said the University will likely 
unveil modifications to the 
University’s sexual misconduct 
policy in the fall. He said these 
changes could potentially focus 
on ensuring students are well-
represented throughout the dis-
ciplinary process and that they 
stay on top of their school work 
during the process.

“One thing, in particular, 

we’re concerned about is there 
are issues of representation dur-
ing the process, and after the 
process, as well, helping students 
to get caught up … to provide the 
interface for the academic side of 

the house to the greatest extent 
possible allows you to continue 
the setting of a very difficult 
period of time,” he said.

E. Royster Harper, vice presi-

dent of student life, also attend-
ed the chat. Harper outlined 
several steps the University was 
taking to improve the Univer-
sity’s existing policies.

She listed increased outreach 

to student groups, adding staff 
to the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center and ana-
lyzing results from the student 
survey on sexual misconduct that 
was distributed this semester.

Student creates

Rather than flipping back 

and forth between RateMy-
Professors.com and the LSA 
Course Guide, LSA senior 
Mitchell Gildenberg created 
a Google Chrome plug-in that 
displays the site’s teacher rat-
ings on the course guide.

The application is called 

“University of Michigan Cour-
seguide+,” and students can 
download it from the Chrome 
Web Store. Once students 
download the plug-in, they 
will see the professors’ rat-
ings listed under their names 
upon opening the LSA Course

Rating 
categories 

include overall rating, average

Schlissel: ‘U’ to improve 
sexual assault procedures


versity in on its Facebook page 
Wednesday.

“The 
Center 
for 
Campus 

Involvement 
understands 
that 

there 
are 
many 
perspectives 

regarding 
the 
film 
American 

Sniper,” the statement read. “...
We are planning to screen Ameri-
can Sniper separately from the 
upcoming UMix event, in a forum 
that provides an appropriate space 
for dialogue and reflection.”

Tuesday morning, after dis-

covering UMix — a University-
sponsored social event held most 

Friday nights — was planning to 
show the film “American Sniper,” 
LSA sophomore Lamees Mekka-
oui wrote to the Center for Cam-
pus Involvement regarding her 
concerns about the film’s showing.

Directed by Clint Eastwood, 

“American Sniper” is based on 
the autobiography of U.S. Navy 
Seal Chris Kyle, who gained rec-
ognition for having the most con-
firmed kills by a sniper in U.S. 
military history during his ser-
vice in Iraq.

While some see it as a film as 

a testament to American nation-
alism, others, like Mekkaoui, felt 
the film inspired anti-Muslim 
sentiment and did not think it 

was appropriate to show at UMix, 
which is generally a positive and 
safe alternative to other Friday 
night activities.

“The reason why the film was 

disturbing to be played at UMix 
is because UMix is supposed to be 
fun and inclusive, and the movie 
‘American Sniper’ raised a lot of 
controversy from all sides of the 
spectrum,” Mekkaoui said. “It’s 
clearly not something that could 
be fun and inclusive. It just doesn’t 
go with Build-A-Bear and inflat-
able laser tag, those things just 
don’t go with ‘American Sniper.’ ”

Wednesday evening, Univer-

sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald 
said it is unclear whether the 

“American Sniper” screening will 
still include a panel discussion, as 
promised initially by the CCI.

Mekkaoui said the panel dis-

cussion is central to her support 
of the University’s decision to 
show both films.

“I’m really thankful to CCI for 

taking quick action in order to 
make sure that the voices of stu-
dents were heard on campus and 
that CCI really acknowledged 
and made them feel like they 
mattered,” Mekkaoui said.

In response to the controver-

sy, Michigan football coach Jim 
Harbaugh wrote in a tweet that 
he plans to watch the film with 
his team.

President draws 
on experience to 
discuss genetics

By DYLAN BENNETT

For the Daily

When about 150 Biology 172 

students opened their notebooks 
on Wednesday, the lecturer at the 
head of the class was not their 
usual professor; it was University 
President Mark Schlissel.

Schlissel discussed personal-

ized medicine and the human 
genome as a guest lecturer 
Wednesday morning in Rackham 
Auditorium.

Biology Lecturer Laury Wood 

invited Schlissel to teach her 
Biology 172 class for a day. Schlis-
sel’s lecture took the place of 
Wood’s regular Wednesday lec-
ture. Before the lecture, Wood 
said her students were looking 
forward to hearing from Schlissel 
since they had spent time in class 
studying the human genome.

Schlissel’s lecture drew on his 

lengthy career in the sciences. 
He graduated from Princeton 
University with a degree in bio-
chemical sciences and earned 
both an M.D. and Ph.D. from the 
Johns Hopkins University School 
of Medicine, where he also served 

as a faculty member later in his 
career. He also served as dean 
of biological sciences at the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley, 
from 2008 to 2011 and has years 
of research experience in biology.

Before he assumed the presi-

dent, 
Schlissel 
was 
a 
noted 

researcher in the field of immu-
nology. A focus of his work cen-
tered on how immune cells form 
in bone marrow. In 2013, he pub-
lished five papers while provost at 
Brown University, and during this 
time continued to work with his 
last Ph.D. students at Berkeley.

As he walked into Rackham, 

Schlissel said he was excited to 
have the opportunity to teach, 
especially about a subject he is 
passionate about and in which he 
has a lot of experience.

“I love to teach, and I was 

invited by a faculty colleague 
earlier in the year who thought it 
would be both fun for me and fun 
for the students, and I jumped at 
the chance,” Schlissel said.

At the start of his lecture, 

Schlissel noted that it was his 
first time teaching a class at the 
University.

“I intend to do some more of 

this as the years go by, but thanks 
for being my guinea pigs,” Schlis-
sel said.

Several of Schlissel’s com-

ments centered on recently devel-

oped biological research tools 
used to understand the basic 
functioning of cells and organ-
isms. Schlissel said these tools 
are now used to combat disease 
and improve human health.

“It really represents one of the 

future trends in clinical care,” 
Schlissel said.

To gain a sense of the audi-

ence’s future career plans, Schlis-
sel asked how many students plan 
on applying to medical school. A 
majority of the student audience 
raised their hands.

LSA freshman Eli Simons, a 

Biology 172 student, said he was 
fascinated by Schlissel’s profes-
sional background in biology.

“I think its really exciting that 

we have someone who is so expe-
rienced in this growing field that 
is likely the future of many cures 
of different diseases,” Simons 
said. “The fact that he is president 
of our school adds a lot of gravitas 
to what he has to say.”

Another student in the class, 

LSA freshman Michael Stan-
do, said he was particularly 
impressed by how Schlissel took 
the time to interact academically 
with students.

“I think it’s nice he spends 

his time with the student body,” 
Stando said. “People actually see 
him as a person rather just a fig-
ure.”

Matthaei Botanical 
Gardens staff cuts 

down plant

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

After 80 years at the Matthaei 

Botanical Garden, the Univer-
sity’s American agave plant 
was cut down before a group of 
spectators Wednesday morn-
ing.

According to Mike Palmer, 

the garden’s manager of horti-
culture, the American agave is 
monocarpic, meaning that after 
flowering, the plant naturally 
dies. Most plants grow for 25 
to 30 years before flowering. 
This specific agave grew for 80 
years before it flowered over 
the summer, making it a rarity, 
Palmer said.

Palmer said after years of 

slow growth, the plant reached 

six feet in height and eight feet 
in width, and it began to show a 
flower stalk last year.

“We don’t know why it took 

80 years, but it started sending 
up a flower stalk a year ago in 
April and it was very exciting,” 
Palmer said. “But also we know 
what happens when an agave 
flowers; it eventually dies, so 
that was kind of sad.”

According to a University 

press release, University alum 
Alfred Whiting brought the 
plant to Ann Arbor from New 
Mexico in 1934. The plant is 
native to Mexico and the south-
western United States. It was 
kept in a pot for 30 years before 
being moved to the garden in 
the 1960s.

Palmer said after the stalk 

became 
visible 
last 
April, 

the plant began to grow at a 
rapid rate. At this time, it also 
became a popular attraction 
for the garden; last year, visitor 
traffic increased by 50 percent 

after the agave bloomed.

“It grows so slow for 80 years, 

then when it switches over to 
flowering, the hormones and 
everything in the plant changes 
and it begins to send up this 
unique flower stalk,” Palmer 
said. “It was shooting up at six 
inches every 24 hours. It went 
right up to the glass and then 
we took the glass off so it could 
grow above the glass. It’s 28 
feet tall.”

Palmer said the American 

agave is “officially dead,” and is 
being cut down due to the dan-
ger it would pose if it were to 
fall over.

Though the plant is now 

dead, Palmer said it will live 
on in two ways. For one, the 
Botanical Gardens will reuse 
its seeds to plant a new agave. 
Second, the plant’s stalk has 
been given to a music profes-
sor who is planning on making 
flutes from the material.

Palmer noted the unique 

nature of the plant and that it 
differs from the plants people 
typically interact with in their 
daily lives.

“This speaks to me about the 

fragility of the ecosystem and 
the life that these plants have. 
I think this plant has given 
people more to think about,” he 
said.

gained about 1,000 users, mostly 
in the last week. Gildenberg said 
he was surprised by the number 

of downloads.

“I wasn’t even sure how it 

would turn out in the beginning, 
and it was really anyone’s guess 
as to how people would receive 
it, but it was something that I 
really wanted, so I figured other 
students would want it as well,” 
Gildenberg said. “The friends I 
showed went, ‘Mitchell this is 
amazing.’ They wanted it very 
much, so I figured I would release 
it.”

Gildenberg said he believes 

the extension will help speed up 
the process of backpacking for 
classes.

“I think it’s going to help them 

speed up their decisions — having 
all the information they need on a 
teacher and helping them choose 
the best professor they could get,” 
Gildenberg said.

Though he thinks the exten-

sion and the site will help stu-
dents, Gildenberg recognizes the 
flaws associated with students 

trusting ratings based on little 
feedback, as some of the profes-
sors only have one or two ratings.

Though 
this 
extension 
is 

geared toward students, some 
professors say they have mixed 
feelings about RateMyProfessors.
com, in general.

Physics Lecturer David Winn 

said he would neither discourage 
nor encourage students to use the 
website. Winn is listed as one of 
the more popular professors on 
the site, but he said this does not 
change his opinions. He pointed 
out that students should not solely 
use the site when deciding wheth-
er or not to take a class.

“These criteria make it use-

ful as a tie-breaker, but students 
should really pick their classes 
based on what subjects are inter-
esting and useful to them,” Winn 
said.

“All of those efforts that, in 

different ways, shine a spotlight 
on this issue are really, really 
important,” Harper said. “So 
the more creative and diverse 
we can be with our programs 
means we will pick up differ-
ent students in different areas 
to help understand and begin 
to change the climate. And 
that’s why I think culture 
shift is so important.”

Though students raised ques-

tions related to sexual assault 
during the chat, Schlissel set 
the conversation by opening 
the forum with a video to tie 
with Sexual Assault Awareness 
Month. The clip featured Uni-
versity administrators discuss-
ing their commitment to ending 
sexual misconduct.

Schlissel 
said 
University 

administrators dedicate a sig-
nificant proportion of their time 
together working to create a 
safer campus.

“...Sexual assault, in par-

ticular, is a topic of discussion 
almost every time we meet,” 
he said. “It’s not backburner, 
it’s a front burner. I think 
it’s going to take a consistent 
effort that’s a collaboration 
between the University lead-
ership, the faculty, the staff, 
and then, all the members of 
our community need to figure 
out together how to make this 
place the safest place to go to 
school that there is.”

An LSA junior, who asked 

to 
remain 
anonymous 
for 

this article, identified her-
self as a survivor of sexual 
assault. During the chat, she 
described 
her 
experience 

with the University’s report-
ing process. She told Schlissel 
she first reported the assault 
to the University last July and 
received her first decision that 
September. Because she did 
not agree with the initial deci-
sion, she was given 10 days to 
file an appeal. The results of 
her appeal were not released 
until just before the fall 
semester’s final examinations.

“I do not feel at all that 

the 
University 
supported 

me throughout the process 
because it was a very trying, 
very horrible time in my life 
and I feel like, first off, that 
the University could improve 
its process is by shortening 
the time between the report 
and the decision,” she said. 
“And also when we turn in 
the appeal, we have 10 days 
to write that appeal and 
then we don’t get a decision 
for a month and a half, it’s 
extremely unfair.”

After hearing the account, 

Harper apologized for the poli-
cy’s faults and said the University 
is working to make the reporting 
process more efficient.

“One of the things we are 

changing 
is 
the 
timeline, 

holding 
ourselves 
to 
that 

standard much, much tighter 
because it’s too hard,” Harper 
said. “And also switching it so 
that you don’t go all the way 
through the process and then 
appeal, but you can appeal 
right away. You are absolutely 
right about the timeline and 
we are going to fix that.”

Several members of SAPAC 

attended the chat, includ-
ing members of their Men’s 
Activism Program.

Schlissel 
also 
discussed 

engaging student-athletes in 

sexual assault awareness, 
and said he talked about 
the issue during a recent 
meeting 
with 
LSA 
junior 

Cooper Charlton, the former 
president of the Student-Ath-
lete Advisory Committee and 
Central Student Government 
president-elect. Charlton said 
there are two problems with 
the existing sexual assault 
education programs for ath-
letes — the programs are 
lengthy and student-athletes 
feel stigmatized.

“I think you need to reach 

a student leader on each 
of 
those 
teams,” 
Schlis-

sel said. “Then they become 
your champions and then it 
becomes cultural.”

LSA senior Ashley Barnes, a 

member of SAPAC, said sexual 
assault education needs to become 
more of a priority to the Univer-
sity. She said many administra-
tors don’t seem to have educated 
themselves on the topic.

“My issue is it’s not that 

it’s only at the student level 
at this point, it’s also at the 
administrative level,” Barnes 
told Schlissel at the chat.

Schlissel 
acknowledged 

that there is still room for 
educating University admin-
istrators.

“Five years ago I didn’t 

understand 
this 
issue 
at 

all,” Schlissel said. “I didn’t 
understand why it wasn’t 
the police and courts’ prob-
lem until I started talking to 
people that had experienc-
es, so I think there’s a huge 
amount of learning that has 
to go on at all different lev-
els, and I do think I should be 
responsible for helping train 
the senior staff to understand 
these issues.”

remember that 148 is not a number.”

Ajetunmobi said the relatively 

small turnout at the vigil reflects 
the need for students to know more 
about international events than 
what they can find on Twitter.

“We don’t want people to forget 

the issues and simply move from one 
hashtag to the next,” Ajetunmobi 
said. “Hashtags don’t save lives unless 
we do something about them.”

Social Work student Cynthia 

Simekha also spoke of the lack of 
media coverage of the murders. 
She said events such as the January 
2015 massacre of 12 people at the 
offices of the French satirical paper 
Charlie Hebdo garnered immediate 

international attention, whereas the 
murders in Kenya attracted suffi-
ciently less media coverage.

“We go on with our lives, be 

happy and get our degrees, but what 
for?” Simekha said. “Two-hundred 
girls from Nigeria are still missing. 
Forty-three children from Mexico 
are still gone. What do we do? Noth-
ing. This isn’t a one-time incident. 
It’s been happening for years.”

At the event, LSA freshman Davi-

na Buruchara spoke about three of 
the students who were murdered as 
they ran back to save their friends 
inside the college building. She also 
recited a poem about the experi-
ence, which was written by her 
friend from Kenya.

“How many of you dream of 

passing exams with honors and 
getting an internship?” Buruchara 

said. “Many of us also have dreams 
about getting married soon. They 
also had dreams just like us. But 
now they are all gone.”

Trey Boynton, director of the 

Office of Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs, said it is important for the 
University community to come 
together during such tragedies and 
help one another.

“Events like these allow people 

to come together in a safe space to 
express their grief and emotions 
and not feel isolated,” Boynton said.

Ajetunmobi also emphasized the 

importance of students having safe 
spaces to talk about these events.

“The University needs to create 

spaces for all students,” Ajetunmobi 
said. “The University should take 
time to learn about the students and 
create resources for them.”

The hashtag generated thousands 
of tweets from across the country.

Dillard said the #BBUM cam-

paign and other diversity-related 
expressions of student concerns 
generated an internal discussion 
within LSA about how to educate 
faculty on issues of diversity and 
inclusion.

“We believed that the way of 

addressing some of these concerns 
was to give faculty more informa-
tion and then start to give them 
resources for how to think about 
microaggressions and the other 
kind of things the students were 
talking about, inside their own 
classrooms,” she said.

Speaking to broader Univer-

sity struggles with low minority 
enrollment, Dillard said one par-
ticularly troubling rate at which 
enrolled Black students leave the 
University for another institution.

She said the University must 

take decisive steps to make signifi-
cant progress on the issue.

“When I think about race in 

America, I am increasingly com-
ing to find that what we need to 
do is to not just think in incremen-
tal ways,” she said. “I think we’ve 
been really inhibited by that — we 
can only do things around the 
edges, that we have to be careful. 
So it means that nobody wants to 
do anything bold anymore.”

Dillard said there are currently 

about 99 courses that fulfill the 
University’s Race and Ethnicity 
requirement. She said 43 percent 

of these courses focus on issues 
within the United States. Over-
all, Anthropology 101 is the most 
popular.

She opened up conversation 

of specific reforms to the crowd, 
asking how attendees think the 
requirement could be reformed. 
Dillard said the committee plan-
ning the review of the requirement 
remains in the information gath-
ering stages, and is still exploring 
what changes could be made.

Students’ concerns were most-

ly centered around whether the 
courses should focus more on 
past or current issues related to 
race, as well as whether current 
courses clearly address matters 
of race. Attendees also discussed 
how future courses could do a bet-
ter job of educating students who 
haven’t previously engaged with 
these topics.

LSA freshman Darian Razdar, 

a frequent seminar attendee, said 
in an interview after Wednesday’s 
session that while he was confi-
dent Dillard is passionate about 
reforming the requirement, he 
was disappointed by omissions in 
the information she presented.

He pointed, in particular, to 

courses listed in part of the require-
ment that he said don’t focus heav-
ily on race — an issue also raised 
during the group discussion.

“I feel that she should want to 

have substantive discussions of 
race happening, and I didn’t hear 
anything on that from her,” he said.

Schlissel also addressed the 

requirement. He said he didn’t 
think it was possible to design an 
ideal Race and Ethnicity require-
ment course, and that he liked the 
idea of many courses fulfilling the 
requirement.

“I think that one purpose of the 

race and ethnicity requirement 
is to promote the discussion,” he 
said. “Any kind of discussion that 
taps into this set of issues and 
that licenses you to speak with 
one another and to speak with the 
faculty about this set of issues of 
what it’s like to be part of a group 
or many groups in modern society 
in any context.”

Schlissel added that he felt the 

University did have an obligation 
to make everyone on campus feel 
safe, but said achieving that would 
require some unsettling conversa-
tions.

“If we want to make progress on 

this set of issues together, which I 
think most of us would recognize 
are the most challenging issues 
we’re dealing with in terms of the 
campus climate, we’re going to 
have to go through some uncom-
fortable times and some really 
difficult, challenging, threatening 
kind of conversations in order to 
educate each other and to see how 
one another are looking at these 
difficult issues,” he said.

Along 
with 
discussing 
the 

requirement, attendees also asked 
questions about a variety of issues, 
including campus police and fac-

ulty and staff knowledge of diver-
sity issues.

In response to a question about 

his plans to increase diversity 
overall, Schlissel highlighted sev-
eral initiatives from the past year. 
He pointed to his launch of a plan-
ning process for the whole campus 
to increase the diversity of the stu-
dent body.

“There are series of creative 

ideas that are being considered, 
and we are going to pick some and 
get started and see how it works, 
with the goal of increasing diver-
sity of the campus in many ways,” 
he said. “Not just racial and ethnic 
but socioeconomic, geographic. I 
think there is dearth of diversity 
of political thought on our campus 
— I think that’s an important thing 
to diversify. So, in many ways.”

Razdar 
said 
hearing 
from 

administrators exposed him to the 
realities of working within institu-
tions.

“I didn’t really hear completely 

everything that I wanted to out of 
the president, in particular, when 
it comes to concrete solutions,” he 
said. “Obviously it’s hard for him 
to talk about that because he is get-
ting to know the University after 
a year. I don’t know. I was slightly 
disappointed. I felt like he could be 
more pointed on his remarks.”

LSA sophomore Reon Daw-

son, who has attended several 
seminars, said while the guests 
addressed many issues, group 
discussions like Wednesday’s also 

showed that sometimes the chal-
lenge is not identifying problems, 
but implementing solutions to 
make the University a safer place.

“The way we talked about 

(diversity) in class, there was no 
set solution,” he said. “There were 
solutions, but nobody was ready to 
put it in place.”

In an interview with the Daily 

after the event, Schlissel said he 

thought these kind of discussions 
help make progress on these sets 
of issues.

“The things I learned today 

give me a sense of what’s impor-
tant to students, what’s important 
to some of the faculty and (to) this 
gentleman from town,” he said. 
“All these thing get incorporated 
in how we think about the plans 
we need to make.”

“Michigan 
Football

‘American 
Sniper’! 

Proud of Chris Kyle & Proud 
to be an American & if that 
offends anybody then so be it!” 
Harbaugh tweeted.

The controversy surround-

ing the screening — which has 
since gained national media 
attention — began Tuesday, 
when Mekkaoui wrote a per-
sonal letter of concern to the 
CCI.

After posting a screenshot 

of her letter on Facebook and 
garnering support from peers, 
Mekkaoui created a collec-
tive letter urging the CCI, who 
organizes UMix, to choose 
a different film. The letter 
attracted more than 300 signa-
tures from people who signed 
as members of Middle East-
ern, North African or Muslim 
communities. Those who did 
not identify themselves as fall-
ing in this category signed “in 
solidarity.” Mekkaoui said a 
majority of the signatures were 
signed by students in solidarity.

“There were actually more 

non-Middle Eastern students 
and non-Muslim students than 

there were Middle Eastern or 
Muslim students signed on, 
so that’s fantastic,” Mekka-
oui said. “It shows that this 
is clearly an issue that every-
one thinks, from a variety of 
backgrounds, that it is some-
thing really salient and that it’s 
something that needed to be 
changed.”

Mekkaoui said during her 

time as a student at the Univer-
sity, she has learned to take a 
stance against injustice.

“U of M teaches us that when 

we see something that is wrong 
on campus to raise questions, 
and we proceeded to, so I’m 
really happy about that,” she 
said.

However, 
other 
students 

who disagree with Mekka-
oui’s views have united behind 
third-year Law student Rachel 
Jankowski’s 
petition, 
which 

called on the CCI to reverse 
their decision and show “Amer-
ican Sniper” on Friday as 
planned. It’s unclear whether 
the petition will be taken down 
now that CCI announced its 
plans to reschedule the show-
ing for a different forum.

“If the University prevents 

a movie like this from being 
shown, it promotes intolerance 
and stifles dialogue and debate 

on the subject and goes directly 
against the atmosphere UMix 
purports to provide,” the CSG 
petition states. “As adults at a 
public university, we should 
have the option to view this 
movie if we so choose and have 
the opportunity to engage on 
the topics it presents to come 
to our own conclusions on the 
subjects.”

The petition calls for the CCI 

to show the movie as planned 
but allow students to present 
their own opinions on the film 
after its showing. The petition 
currently has 486 signatures as 
of Wednesday night.

Jankowski 
could 
not 
be 

reached for comment.

University alum Hari Vutuk-

uru, an officer in the U.S. Army, 
tweeted Wednesday morning 
that he was disappointed in the 
University’s initial decision to 
cancel the screening.

“...Did you ever consider how 

the hundreds of ROTC cadets, 
midshipmen, & student-veter-
ans would react to this? Shame 
on you,” he tweeted.

W

e 
were 
40 
minutes 

into an 11 a.m. lecture 
for Bible as Literature 

when our profes-
sor, Ralph Wil-
liams, 
offered 

another one of his 
“Williamsisms.” 
It was in the thick 
of a complicated, 
careful 
analysis 

on the theological 
necessity of the 
annihilation 
of 

the first genera-
tion of Israelites 
in the wilderness 
(in Numbers, precluding the entry 
into the promised land at Canaan). 
It was the sort of aphorism that, 
thrust off-hand, I almost missed 
amidst my grasping to keep up with 
the narrative, the details, the char-
acters and the chronology. But this 
one was a diamond in the rough, a 
needle in the haystack, a pearl in 
the sand, whatever idiom suits your 
fancy. A biggy. I’ll get back to it.

Impossibility 
is 
an 
obscure, 

transient notion. Long have phi-
losophers sought to explain that 
which defies the laws, the mental 
framework within which we live 
our lives. Take Isaac Newton, for 
example, who posited much of the 
foundational 
physics 
principles 

upon which modern theory rests. 
During his time, the concept of the 
presence and interaction of “invis-
ible forces” as a medium guiding 
much of the observable phenomena 
was truly implausible and impossi-
ble. In the words of Williams: “Oh” 
(i.e. “they really swung and missed 
on that one?”)

Indeed, it seems, something is only 

impossible until it can be explained. 
Impossibility withers in the face of 
reason, removed from the precipice 
of the miraculous and placed within 
the realm of the conceptual. In this 
way, impossibility is but a temporary 

asterisk marking that which we do 
not yet understand.

So, why does any of this long-

winded musing on the nature of 
impossibility matter? Well, it’s nec-
essary in order to gain an apprecia-
tion that the impossible is overcome 
every day.

History is flush with this storyline. 

Light could not be explained until 
Louis de Broglie and David Bohm 
articulated the wave-particle dual-
ity. No sprinter could run a mile in 
less than four minutes until Roger 
Bannister did. Pictures could not 
move until Georges Meliés and oth-
ers made the first movies. No pitcher 
could throw faster than 102 miles 
per hour until Aroldis Chapman did. 
Hell, hepatitis C could not be cured 
until Sovaldi until its approval in 
2013. The plot of history’s “impos-
sibles” is canonical and repetitive: “it 
could not happen, until, well, it did.”

Albert Einstein put this concep-

tion of impossibility (while at the 
center of a heated debate between 
science and religion) a particularly 
eloquent way: “To sense that behind 
anything that can be experienced 
there is something that our mind 
cannot grasp and whose beauty and 
sublimity reaches us only indirectly 
and as a feeble reflection, this is reli-
giousness … In this sense I too am 
religious, with the reservation that 
‘cannot grasp’ does not have to mean 
‘forever ungraspable.’ ”

In other words, Einstein believed 

that religion and science reflect 
a rather similar fascination with 
understanding the impossible.

That is, until we, inevitably, 

grasp it.

I know, I know. I’m a little bit off 

the deep end right now. So let me 
come back to that Williamsism, if 
you’ll let me. In that 40th minute, 
Ralph stated, simply and as only he 
can, that “possibility is only bounded 
by the imagination.”

Put another way: you think, there-

fore you may be. Conversely, deem-
ing something impossible is a form 
of creative apathy. It’s a label used to 
qualify an anomalous phenomenon. 
It’s a manifestation of intellectual 
arrogance, a claim that the current 
framework of comprehension is the 
right, and the only, one.

Of course, if there’s one immu-

table historical truth, it’s that things 
happen, facts emerge, and minds 
change. Indeed, the impossible is as 
malleable and temporary as the lens 
through which we view it. Wow! (As 
an aside, if you haven’t registered yet, 
I’d go take one of his classes.)

In other news, this is my last offi-

cial column for The Michigan Daily. 
In my time writing, I’ve addressed 
many different topics, including once 
providing a reflection on some of the 
career decisions I’ve made, coupled 
with some advice. I would be remiss 
if I didn’t add one last nugget, one 
that Adidas popularized a few years 
back: “Impossible is nothing.”

Here’s what I make of the tagline: 

“impossible,” as a label, is nothing. 
It’s meaningless, an excuse for a void 
of knowledge or of skill. And inverse-
ly, impossible is no thing. No thing is 
impossible. It’s just as Coach Holtz 
(and Mom) said it: “Nothing is impos-
sible … if you put your mind to it.”

I always loved “Hardy Boys” and 

“Scooby Doo” as a kid. And this idea 
— that the most distant challenges 
are but mysteries waiting to be solved 
— is tremendously inspiring. I hope 
you find it as empowering as I do as 
you move forward with your life.

Actually, one more thing, before 

I sign off, that I would regret if I 
didn’t do. I want to thank my read-
ers for the attention, for the support 
and for giving me the opportunity 
to grow up through this newspaper 
these four years.

Thank you. It means the world.

A great first step

Other student groups should get involved with BSU initiative
T

he Michigan Institute for the Improvement of African 
American Representation, a committee within the University’s 
Black Student Union, has organized a program to host 46 high 

school students from Kalamazoo Public Schools for three days at the 
University. Led by Will Royster, an LSA and Engineering junior and the 
BSU academic concerns committee chair, the purpose of the program is 
to encourage underrepresented minorities to apply to and enroll in the 
University. This initiative is beneficial for both the high school students 
and for the University as a whole. To keep expanding the program, as 
the BSU is currently in the works of doing, other student organizations 
should become involved in the initiative.

During their three-day stay, the high school 

students are given the opportunity to tour 
campus, participate in an SAT workshop and 
hear from admissions counselors. To participate 
in the program, students are expected to have 
a GPA of at least 3.0 and submit a 300-word 
essay. This requirement provides students with 
possibly their first experience writing college 
admissions essays.

The program allows students to envision 

themselves 
as 
future 
Wolverines 
by 

providing social activities for them, including 
opportunities to interact with different student 
organizations on campus and hear from an 
alum. The program also strives to connect the 
high school students with current students 
from the same area.

When talking about the program in an 

interview with the Daily, Royster stressed 
the importance of the program for minority 
students. “We want to allow them to acclimate 
to the culture and make them passionate about 
the University,” Royster said. “We want them to 
envision themselves at the University.”

Furthermore, 
this 
initiative 
provides 

an opportunity for the University to work 
toward 
increasing 
minority 
enrollment 

without violating Proposal 2, which prohibits 

affirmative action at Michigan universities. 

The program’s goal to increase enrollment 

of students within underrepresented groups 
has many merits. With a more diverse 
population, students will benefit from an 
environment in which ideas are fostered from 
people of varying backgrounds. If students are 
never exposed to individuals who come from 
different backgrounds than their own, they 
are limited by a lack of new perspectives. The 
purpose of higher minority enrollment is to 
promote inclusiveness, prevent discrimination 
and decrease the marginalization of minority 
voices on campus. Additionally, an increase in 
minority students will allow the University 
to better serve the state of Michigan and hold 
the University more accountable to the public 
it is serving.

Similar programs may be implemented in 

the future alongside the expansion of BSU’s 
program. While this is the first semester 
the BSU initiative will take place and the 
number of enrollees seems minimal, the 
program serves as a great first step to increase 
minority enrollment. Both the Central Student 
Government and the University should support 
this program in all possible ways and work with 
BSU toward its upcoming expansion.

FROM THE DAILY

D

ear young, impressionable, 
just-turned-18-three-days-
ago me,

College is a new 

beginning for you, 
and you need the 
change it provides. 
You’re 
nervous 

now but also excit-
ed to be in Ann 
Arbor, a place with 
thousands of new 
faces and many 
new freedoms.

College is going 

to be different. You 
say this in your 
head now, but soon you’ll understand 
how much truth this mantra holds. 
You’re going to grow apart from peo-
ple you don’t currently want to lose. 
You’re going to grow close to people 
with whom you didn’t think you had 
anything in common initially. People 
and problems that seem so central to 
your life today will be a minor blip on 
your radar by senior year.

The biggest problem you’ll tackle 

is figuring out what to study. During 
Campus Day you heard about the 
Ford School, and you’ll end up 
choosing this path. It’ll be a good 
experience and you’ll meet some 
amazing people, but you’re not going 
to have a thing like everyone else. You 
won’t suddenly become passionate 
about saving the environment or 
changing the tax code or fixing labor 
laws. You’ll choose health policy as 
your focus area, mainly because you 
took an amazing public health class 
that made you change the way you 
view political problems.

Ultimately, though, you’ll realize 

health policy isn’t what will get you 
out of bed in the morning.

So you’ll look at possible minors to 

supplement your Ford School experi-
ence. You like a lot of different things, 
so it’s going to be hard to choose just 
one. One day, while you’re sitting in 
Rackham, you’ll stumble across the 
Sweetland Minor in Writing. You like 
writing, so you’ll decide to apply. By 
senior year, you will be confident that 
it was the best decision you made at 
Michigan. You’re a writer even now, 
sitting on your twin XL bed in your 
unfamiliar room, but you don’t have 
the courage to admit it yet. The first 
time you say it out loud, though, it’ll 
seem like you’ve gained the mental 
clarity for which you’ve been search-

ing since you arrived on campus.

Your writing classes will be 

treasured spaces where you can be 
vulnerable, where you can share. 
You’ll want to thank each one of your 
peers who took the time to read your 
writing and give you critiques and 
encourage you, but it’ll be difficult 
to convey how much that means 
to you. “Hey, smart people!” your 
professor will write when she sends 
out announcements to the class. We 
are a group of smart people, you’ll 
think. I am smart.

Each year you are enrolled at 

Michigan is going to be different 
from the last. Really different, 
actually. Most of this is because each 
year you’ll spend most of your time 
with a different group of people. 
Right now you share campus with 
your brother, but that will end by 
middle of junior year when you head 
to Washington D.C. for a semester. 
You’ll miss being able to drive to 
Zingerman’s on a Sunday and talk 
about whatever is on your mind with 
him, but luckily, you’re going to end 
up about an hour and a half away 
from each other after graduation. 
South Quad is a great spot for now, 
but next year you’ll live in the 
sorority house and spend a lot of time 
with Pledge Class 2011. You’ll spend 
most of junior year in D.C., living 
with Fordies and PoliSci majors. 
Senior year, you’ll live all over Ann 
Arbor (I’d tell you that story, too, but 
I signed a nondisclosure agreement 
which prohibits me from doing so).

You’re going to join a sorority 

in a few weeks, and you’ll wonder 
whether or not you fit into the house 
you got a bid from. The girls in the 
house are “chill.” You are most defi-
nitely not chill. Then you’ll realize 
chil in this context means you’re 
going to have fun with these peo-
ple whether you’re out on a Foot-
ball Saturday or lying in the Green 
Room on a Wednesday watching 
“Good Will Hunting.” Your best 
friend in the house will be the same 
kind of hyper/chill hybrid as you.

You don’t know yet, but next year, 

the girl you met during orientation 
will walk around Pike in her pajamas 
with you at midnight on a Friday 
because she knows you just had your 
heart ripped out of your chest by 
someone you thought would be in 
your life forever. A year later, you’ll 
laugh about how ridiculous you two 

probably looked, you sobbing down 
Oxford and her wearing a bright-
orange shirt with “sober monitor” 
written on the back.

Also, 
an 
important 
tip 
for 

sophomore year: don’t sign up for 
Honors Calculus.

You’re a freshman who thinks she 

wants to live in New York City one 
day, but in two years you’re going 
to intern in D.C. and randomly be 
assigned a roommate. She’ll be the 
most ridiculous, spirited and enter-
taining friend you’ll have during 
your time at the University, and 
you will share many inside jokes 
that make you laugh until you can’t 
breathe. You’ll live together in D.C. 
again a few months later, and get 
into more trouble. You’ll also make 
a friend who will join in your com-
plaints about Shake Shack chang-
ing their fries, watch kids movies 
on Saturday mornings while you 
recover from drinking one too many 
on Friday nights and take an entire 
album worth of selfies with you dur-
ing your semester in Washington.

You’re struggling to make friends 

now, but in a few weeks, a tall girl 
from Midland will run into the 
room where you happen to be hang-
ing with your new friends. She’ll 
explain how she’s currently sex-
iled and introduce herself, and by 
senior year it’ll be difficult to avoid 
crying with her anytime someone 
talks about graduation. Next year, 
a girl will introduce herself, saying 
she knows you through a friend of 
a friend, and senior year you’ll be 
there for each other when you each 
need a friend the most.

But you don’t know any of this 

currently, as you lie in bed at 
night and let a few tears fall down 
your face. You are just a homesick 
freshman — nervous, but also 
excited to see what the next four 
years will bring. You’re the unedited 
version of the person you’ll become 
in the next four years, the first cut 
of many revisions you’ll make to 
yourself without even realizing it. 
You’re going to grow and you’re 
going to thrive, so get ready for the 
next four years of your life. They’ll 
be over in the blink of an eye.

Go Blue,
Katie

A letter to myself on move-in day

C

ollege education is a mixture of choice, 
effort, perception and circumstance. 
Academically speaking, you can only 

choose from the classes 
offered: this is our circum-
stance. We choose our cours-
es, decide the level of time 
and effort we will invest in 
class and rate the course 
based on our subjective per-
ceptions of what education 
should look like.

A student can choose to 

pursue paths of knowledge 
acquisition or skill honing — 
academic “excellence” or a 
focus on experience-based learning. But often, 
for me, the question is, “How much will you 
remember when you leave?” Will you remem-
ber the historical events you learned, or the 
social justice concepts you dialogued about?

Will the academic habit you hang on to the 

longest be your new coffee addiction?

I wasn’t sure what I came to the University 

for, to be honest. I thought maybe it was to hone 
my writing skills or to learn about how and why 
the earth was being destroyed (along with how 
to prevent destruction). Alongside the “liberal 
arts education” came the idea that I was going 
to college to learn how to learn, to grow as a 
well-rounded human and to become more eli-
gible for the working world.

I did learn many things here. I took a wide 

array of classes that helped me understand dif-
ferent ways of looking at the world and under-
standing humanity. I took classes about writing 
and the earth. I also took classes that taught me 
more about gender, health, race, socioeconomic 
status and Afro-Cuban drumming. They taught 
me more about being perceptive and critical of 
the changing world around me.

However, the classes that made my experi-

ence here uniquely impactful were the classes 
that existed off the beaten trail. These classes 
understood the earth and the human mind as 
concepts that did not fit into textbooks, but 
rather as entities that flourished from creative 
environments of freedom and dialogue. They 
encouraged self-exploration and deep curiosity.

From these classes, I gained an understand-

ing of a different life perspective — one that 
embraced the earth as a grounding life force. 
I gained an understanding of meditation and 
compassion as a type of spirituality. This spiri-
tuality deeply resonated with me. Coming into 
school, I had strong values and convictions, but 
coming out, I better understand how to nurture 
this sense of self.

I highly recommend these classes at the Uni-

versity. In Jazz 450 with Martha Travers in 
School of the Music, Theatre & Dance, students 

learn mindful meditation, how to connect more 
deeply with nature and different ways of coping 
with our daily tedium.

In Psychology of Spirituality with Richard 

Mann, students become friends as they sit in a 
circle and learn about the nuances of navigating 
life as humans.

Environment, Sustainability and Social 

Change, taught to first-years by James 
Crowfoot, a professor and dean emeritus 
in the School of Natural Resources, helps 
freshmen commune with nature in an 
incredibly accessible way.

Writing and the Environment with Aric 

Knuth encourages students to write about their 
nature-based recollections and share their expe-
rience with classmates.

Through these classes, I found meaning, 

calm and purpose with a new understand-
ing of how I can interact with the earth and of 
the anchor the earth can provide me. I learned 
methods of walking and sitting meditation. I 
learned how to greet the elements and how 
to take in others’ life stories. These classes 
spanned beyond the usual limits of the college 
classroom. These classes based themselves in 
dialogue and experience. In circles, we talked 
about our personal journeys.

I learned how to think deeply about the meta-

phors around me.

As a high school student, I perceived societal 

success as my ultimate goal. These are the goals 
set for you by the people around you rather 
than by what you determine makes you happy. 
I set about achieving the highest grades, play-
ing varsity sports, taking many standardized 
tests, joining clubs and not sleeping. I was very 
stressed and very miserable. My most frequent 
emotion during that time was anger.

I went into university knowing that I did not 

want to treat my body and spirit like that again. 
Striving to meet society’s pre-set goals was not 
my personal path to happiness. This much I 
knew. What I needed to find out then was what 
would make me happy.

My professors in these classes didn’t have the 

same rules as others. Their highest concern was 
not whether you ended the semester with an A; 
rather, whether or not you grew as a person.

Learning about my spirituality was my real 

education. I find life lessons in the path these 
professors set me on. If you are still continuing 
your journey at the University, I highly suggest 
finding classes that speak to you along with 
the mandatory requirements. It’s possible that 
it won’t be the classes for your major that are 
embedded deep in your memory, but the classes 
you took for you.

Wolverines surpass last 
season’s numbers, wins

By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS

Daily Sports Writer

At this point, it’s safe to say 

that the Michigan baseball team 
is playing its best baseball of the 
season. It can even be argued that 
the Wolverines are playing better 
baseball now than at any point 
during the last few years.

As 
Michigan 
coach 
Erik 

Bakich has always preached, 
the team is looking to improve 
every single day — in practice, 
in the classroom and on the 
field. One way to measure that 
improvement is by comparing 
this year’s squad to last year’s. 
For starters, the Wolverines (4-5 
Big Ten, 19-13 overall) have won 
19 of their first 32 games, whereas 
the team of old won just 14.

But the stark contrast between 

the 2014 and 2015 squads doesn’t 
end there, as the Daily compares 
both teams from an offensive and 
pitching standpoint.

Offense:

Even a cursory glance at this 

year’s statistics shows that the 
offensive 
production 
severely 

outpaces that of last season.

Tuesday’s 
18-run 
outburst 

against Eastern Michigan served 
as an exclamation point for what 
has, up to this point, been a season 
of dominance for the Wolverines’ 
offense. Michigan leads the Big 
Ten in batting average (.294), 
whereas last year’s team finished 
eighth in the conference (.256).

Just over two weeks into the 

Big Ten schedule, the Wolverines 
have already hit 18 home runs, 
a 
stark 
improvement 
over 

last year’s season total of 14. 
Furthermore, Michigan scored 
more than 10 runs four times 
last season, but Tuesday’s rout of 
the Eagles was already its sixth 
10-plus run game this season.

But Bakich 

won’t 
look 

to 
the 
past 

to 
measure 

this 
year’s 

successes.

“I 
don’t 

think 
about 

last year’s team 
at all,” Bakich 
said. “All I know is we’ve got a 
really good offense, (and) we’re 
really tough one through nine. 
Our offense is a byproduct of 
having good players who keep 
their 
focus 
having 
quality 

at-bats.

“We’ve got a year or two years 

more of experience. Anytime 
you’ve got some talent plus 
experience, you’ve got a chance.”

Pitching:

Coming into the season, the 

Wolverines’ 
biggest 
question 

mark was their pitching staff. 
They were going to have to rely on 
underclassmen, many of whom 
had never experienced pitching 
at the collegiate level.

And 
unfortunately 
for 

Michigan, things have not gone 
as planned. The pitching staff 
has suffered numerous injuries 

throughout the year — most 
notably to junior left-hander Evan 
Hill, who made his first start 
of the season on Tuesday, and 
sophomore right-hander Keith 
Lehmann, who has pitched in 
just five games all year. Both Hill 
and Lehmann had lamented their 
place in last season’s weekend 

rotation.

To make up 

for his injured 
veterans, 
Bakich 
has 

called upon two 
underclassmen 
— 
freshman 

right-hander 
Ryan 
Nutof 

(43.1 
innings 
pitched) 
and 

sophomore 
left-hander 
Brett 

Adcock (36.2) — each of whom has 
lived up to the task.

As for junior right-hander 

Jacob Cronenworth, the third 
weekend starter, he made his first 
career start earlier this season.

Regardless, 
the 
patchwork 

pitching staff has held things 
together nicely, combining for a 
3.67 ERA.

“Early on, we had to get the 

‘freshman’ out of them, some of 
their inexperience,” Hill said. 
“It took some games to do that, 
to think about what your intent 
is behind every pitch in every 
count, but they’re hitting their 
turning point now.”

Added Bakich: “We’ve got a lot 

of good starters. It finally feels 
like we’re getting back to firing 
on all cylinders; the results have 
been very positive.”

Michigan earns first 
Big Ten win at MSU

By BETELHEM ASHAME

For the Daily

Though the Michigan State 

men’s tennis team has also been 
chasing a .500 win-loss record, 
the Spartans have had better 
luck than Michigan as of late. 
With home-court advantage on 
Wednesday 
night, they 
would have 
relished 
the opportunity to inflict even 
more pain on a Wolverine squad 
that had been trying to end a 
nine-game losing streak amidst 
a disaster of a season.

But Michigan refused to go 

down without a fight in East 
Lansing, earning a 4-3 victory.

The Wolverines (1-6 Big Ten, 

4-14 overall) started strong in 
doubles play, as the No. 3 pair 
of sophomore Tyler Gardiner 
and redshirt freshman Davis 
Crocker took care of business 
quickly with an 8-2 win over 
Michigan State’s Doug Zade and 
Jasper Koenen.

“They played the best match 

of the year, and that’s great 
for our team going forward,” 
said Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg. “We really needed 
that. They’ve been getting close, 
they’ve been right there and, 
finally, they broke through and 
did a great job today.”

Michigan had a harder battle 

to fight at the top two positions. 
Both the No. 1 senior duo of 
Alex Petrone and Michael Zhu 
and the No. 2 team of redshirt 
freshman 
Alex 
Knight 
and 

true freshman Leo Hua faced 
stiff competition against the 
Spartans (2-4, 11-12), in which 
every time one side managed 
to secure a point, the other 
countered.

Michigan State came out 

on top, though, winning 8-5 
and 8-6 at the No. 1 and No. 2 
spots, respectively, to claim the 
doubles point.

In 
order 
to 
come 
out 

victorious, 
the 
Wolverines 

needed to win four out of the six 
matches in singles play.

But with a shot at breaking 

the losing streak, a pair of 
freshmen came up big.

Hua and freshman Carter 

Lin started Michigan off on the 
right foot, with Hua beating his 
opponent in straight sets, 6-3, 
7-6, and Lin defeating his in 
three sets, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, to give 
the Wolverines the 2-1 dual-
match lead.

After 
Michigan 
State 

answered 
back 
with 
two 

victories 
of 
its 
own, 
the 

Wolverines were down 3-2 
with just two singles players 
remaining, 
Knight 
and 

Petrone.

“It 
was 
crazy. 
It 
was 

definitely a crazy atmosphere,” 
Steinberg said. “That’s what 
makes college tennis so special, 
because 
you 
get 
in 
those 

situation where you’re down 
3-2 with two tiebreakers going 
on at the same time and you 
have to win both. It’s a really 
cool thing, especially in an 
individual sport like ours, that 
you can win your match, win 
for Michigan and win as a team 
and do it that way.”

With all the pressure sitting 

squarely on their shoulders, 
Knight 
and 
Petrone 
dug 

deep and found the strength 
to overcome the challenge 
that lay before them. Within 
moments of each other, Knight 
and Petrone won the match for 
Michigan with scores of 7-6, 7-6 
and 6-4, 3-6, 7-6, respectively.

For the first time all season, 

the Wolverines won a match 
against a Big Ten opponent, on 
the road no less, against one 
of their biggest rivals with the 
odds stacked against them.

“I’m so proud of the guys. 

I’m really happy for them,” 
Steinberg said. “I’m so proud 
of how they fought today. 
It’s been a long time coming. 
They’ve been so close and they 
finally broke through today. 
I’m excited for them. I wanted 
it for them, especially for the 
freshmen for their first Big Ten 
win. It’s pretty special.”

Despite being well below the 

.500 mark, Michigan hasn’t 
thrown in the towel just yet. 
And for their perseverance, 
the Wolverines were rewarded 
with a win that will linger as 
one of the lasting memories 
from 
a 
largely 
forgettable 

season.

“That’s 
what 
I’m 
most 

proud 
of,” 
Steinberg 
said. 

“We’ve gone through such a 
long losing streak and a lot of 
athletes would quit. But they 
haven’t quit on Michigan. They 
showed resiliency. I’m really 
proud of them, that they got 
this one against a very good 
team on the road in a very tough 
environment. I’m very happy for 
them.”

‘M’ looks to repeat

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Writer

Last season, the Michigan 

club boxing team traveled to 
Miami with a shorthanded and 
injury-riddled 
team, and still 
returned home 
with its first-
ever 
national 

title.

Though the 

goal 
remains 

the same, the 
Wolverines 
won’t have to 
journey nearly 
as far this year.

With 
the 

United 
States 
Intercollegiate 

Boxing 
Association 
National 

Tournament 
coming 
to 
the 

Intramural 
Sports 
Building 

— from April 9 to April 11 — 
Michigan is looking to become 
repeat champions in front of a 
home crowd.

“We’re 
standing 
pretty 

well,” said senior and two-
time national champion Kevin 
Bosma. “We’ve had a long year of 
committed boxers who’ve put a 
lot of work in so far.

“Given the level of work the 

team has put in this year, I have 
no reason to believe we couldn’t 
repeat the success we had last 
year.”

In 
the 
2014 
campaign, 

the Wolverines won the title 
behind five individual national 
champions. But with Bosma 
and sophomore Yazan El-Baba 
as the only returning winners 
this season, the Wolverines 
yield a team composed largely 

of 
newcomers 
with 
limited 

experience 
to 
contend 
for 

national glory.

El-Baba, who was a meager 

0-1 in his career before streaking 
to a national title last year, 
hopes to remind his teammates 
that a lack of experience can be 
trumped with dedication and 
commitment.

“Last year, things were falling 

apart before (the tournament),” 
El-Baba said. “I remember seeing 
a lot of the older guys or people 
I looked up to getting injured 
right before, and knowing that 
they weren’t going to be there, 
I had no expectations for the 
tournament — didn’t think we 
would come away with a team 
title.

“There are a lot of things 

going on inside the club and 
outside. We’re just trying to limit 
the effect of that, still go in with 
strong numbers, and keep the 
new guys’ heads held up high 
and to let them know that, ‘Hey, 
I boxed for my first time last year 
not knowing how good I could 
do, and it worked out pretty 
well.’ ”

Expecting 
150 
boxers 
to 

compete in Ann Arbor, the 
tournament will run for three 
days 
beginning 
Thursday, 

progressing 
through 
the 

quarterfinals, 
semifinals 
and 

championship rounds with each 
day.

Though Michigan will once 

again bring one of the largest 
teams 
to 
the 
tournament, 

Maryland, Georgetown, Eastern 
Michigan and University of San 
Francisco are all expected to 
bring bigger teams than last year 

in hopes of stealing the title from 
the Wolverines’ grasp.

Despite 
the 
increased 

competition, Bosma has seen 
the team rise from an unofficial 
club to national champions in his 
time on campus, and has faith in 
the commitment and training 
the team has endured.

“A lot of our team is largely 

novice 
fighters 
and 
new 

beginners,” Bosma said. “We’re 
really going to rely on our 
coaching and the dedication to 
our sport to come through, and I 
think that it will.”

Fans at the event will see 

the team go for a second title, 
but may also see another set of 
Wolverines go for their first.

After winning a national title 

herself last season, senior Kate 
Johnson looks to match the 
men’s team’s success this year. 
Running the majority of training 
and coaching herself, Johnson 
has built the women’s team into 
one of the nation’s biggest as it 
looks to take down perennial 
powerhouse Army.

Johnson also works at a 

nearby boxing club, where she 
has developed a reputation in 
the area for an intensity that 
not even boxers of both genders 
or the local S.W.A.T team can 
keep up with. Now, she thinks 
her team can turn struggles in 
practice to a team win.

“A lot of girls are going to 

have their first fights there,” she 
said. “But they’ve been training 
pretty hard and look pretty good 
at this point.

“I like to think if they can get 

through my workouts, they’re 
pretty well prepared.”

‘Silent Assassin’ does the little things

Sierra Lawrence 
gets the job done 
in ways that aren’t 

always obvious

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

It all started Sierra Lawrence’s 

freshman year. She would get 
to second base, and Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins would get 
ready to tell her to steal third.

But by the time she looked up, 

Lawrence was in full stride, if 
not already at the bag. That was 
the beginning of the now-junior 
centerfielder’s unique alter ego, 
“The Silent Assassin.”

The sports world sees its fair 

share of nicknames — some 
serious, others absurd.

Reggie Jackson became “Mr. 

October” after he hit three 
home runs on three consecutive 
pitches in Game 6 of the 1977 
World Series. More recently, 
former Michigan guard Nik 
Stauskas picked up the alias 
of “Sauce Castillo” by way of a 
closed-captioning error.

Clearly, the Michigan softball 

team is no exception to the 
nickname phenomenon.

The name fits Lawrence’s 

game well. She’s undoubtedly 
one of the Wolverines’ top 
players, ranking third in runs 
scored, home runs and runs 
batted in.

But 
Lawrence’s 
most 

significant contributions have 
flown under the radar. Hutchins 
revealed that her baserunning 
ability makes her a significant 
threat 
deserving 
of 
the 

nickname, not the home runs 
and RBI.

“Her first year, every time I’d 

look up, she’d be on third base,” 
Hutchins said. “She would just 
show up (at third). Before I had 
a chance to send her, she was 
already standing there. So I 
nicknamed her that because she 

is as good a base runner as I’ve 
ever had. She has great instincts 
(and) she has a tremendous first 
step.”

Added 
freshman 
catcher 

Aidan Falk: “She’s so fast, and 
nobody realizes that. And she’s 
unbelievably 
strong. 
Those 

two combinations (make her) a 
lethal player.”

Lawrence has been placed at 

the leadoff spot in the batting 
order for the majority of the 
season, largely due to her agility 
on the base paths. Hutchins 

explained 
that 
she 
has 
an 

incredible ability to set the game’s 
tone early and to get on base by 
beating out infield singles.

So far this season, Lawrence 

has posted 18 stolen bases on 
19 attempts, ranking first and 
fourth in the category for the 
Wolverines and the Big Ten, 
respectively.

“When I get on base, I just 

want to score,” Lawrence said. 
“So any opportunity I have to 
take a base, I take it. It’s always 
come naturally (to me) to be 

aggressive on the bases.”

Yet Lawrence’s intangibles 

often don’t receive recognition. 
Usually, that is reserved for the 
home-.run hitter or the pitching 
ace.

But 
that 

doesn’t bother 
her. She leaves 
that 
for 
her 

teammates, 
embracing 
a 

leadership role 
for 
Michigan 

instead.

In 
an 

inexperienced 
outfield, 
Lawrence 
is 
the 

only starting player to return 
to the lineup from the 2014 
season after the Wolverines 
graduated Lyndsay Doyle and 
Nicole Sappingfield. It’s clear 
that junior right fielder Kelsey 
Susalla and sophomore left 
fielder Kelly Christner have 
benefited tremendously from 
the experience of “The Silent 

Assassin” in the outfield.

“(She has taught me to have) 

confidence,” 
said 
freshman 

infielder Amanda Vargas. “She 
plays with a sense of swagger. 

All 
players 

can tell that 
she’s 
really 

confident. She 
knows 
what 

she’s 
doing, 

and 
even 
if 

she’s having a 
rough 
game, 

you know the 
next 
game 

she’s going to 

be fine.”

Lawrence’s long tenure in the 

outfield has paid dividends for 
the Wolverines on the defensive 
end. She knows where the ball 
is going before batters can even 
make contact, and she reads 
fly balls with ease, a skill that 
has led her to boast a flawless 
fielding percentage.

Lawrence’s 
innate 
ability 

to judge the ball off the bat, 
in 
combination 
with 
very 

impressive arm strength, often 
turns opposing teams’ would-be 
doubles into singles.

She continues to produce the 

numbers that the fans may not 
care about, but as she has aged, 
the stats that fans look for have 
improved as well. Lawrence has 
already matched her 2014 home 
run total, sending nine balls out 
of the park thus far. And she 
is 21 RBI away from matching 
her 2014 total in the respective 
category.

But she has not wavered 

in 
showing 
that 
she 
will 

consistently trade the highlight-
reel play for a tally in the win 
column.

So 
while 
the 
opposing 

pitchers and fielders focus on 
stopping Michigan’s headliners, 
look for Lawrence to do what 
she does best: slip through their 
gazes yet again, and strike like a 
silent assassin.

ROBERT DUNNE/Daily

Junior centerfielder Sierra Lawrence has stolen 18 bases in 19 attempts this season. She ranks first and fourth in the category for Michigan and the Big Ten, respectively.

“Before I had a 

chance to send her,

INSIDE THE UNIVERSITY’S 

STUDENT LIT JOURNAL

If you find yourself enrolled 

at an esteemed university such 
as the University of Michigan, 
you’ve either been or are a writ-
er to some degree. Whether it be 
typing up lab reports, journal-
ing in your English 125 class or 
finalizing your poetry portfo-
lio, you’ve translated thoughts 
and ideas into some form of a 
written work. Wherever you 
stand on the spectrum, some-
where between occasional essay 
writer and loud and proud Eng-
lish major, you’ve likely been 
strained by the craft at some 
juncture 
of 
your 
academic 

career. Writing — that’ll getcha.

When I sat down at Espresso 

Royale on a rainy afternoon with 
two writers, I was reminded of a 
truth I so often overlook: writ-
ers are an undeniably odd breed. 
That’s not to say LSA senior 
Supreet Grewal and Business 
and LSA junior Nisreen Salka 
were weirdos — quite the oppo-
site, actually. They’re incredibly 
intelligent, witty and well-spo-
ken students of the University; 
the type that restore your dwin-
dling faith in the student body 
after overhearing some utterly 
imbecilic conversation at the 
UGLi. 

Grewal and Salka are the edi-

tor in chief and the finance and 
publications chair, respectively, 
of the University’s undergradu-
ate student-run literary maga-
zine, Xylem. 

Over our afternoon brew, 

we discussed their publication, 
the logistics behind it and its 
lengthy processes of submission 
and composition. But, we spent 
a majority of our time discuss-
ing the strenuous yet rewarding 
process that is writing (i.e. how 
we were all alike in that we’re 
weirdos by way of the craft). 

We touched on the collective 

effervescence 
shared 
among 

writers, or the notion that there 
are unspoken rules one natu-
rally subscribes to by being a 
writer. We determined there’s a 
bevy of components, some ben-
eficial, some agonizing, but all 
relatable. Between our cathar-
tic chat ranging from our love-
hate relationship with clichés to 
the dichotomy of egocentrism 
and self-doubt, just listening to 
each other was like an apology 
of sorts — an apology on behalf 
of our creative venture for its 
affliction.

That’s not to say writing’s 

all bad. Immersing yourself in 
writing is an excellent route to 
self-discovery, or the thoughts 
we can’t seem to articulate in 
any other medium, as Grewal 
can attest.

“I think for me it is mostly 

my experiences, or things I 
can’t put into any other con-
text,” she said. “Sometimes I’ll 
write a poem only because a 
poem is the best form for what 
I’m trying to say,” to which she 
jokingly added has hindered 
her from writing a lot of poems. 

On 
the 
contrary, 
Salka 

approaches her work from a dif-
ferent angle.

“I hate drawing purely from 

my own experiences, but I like 
taking emotions from those 
experiences and putting it into 
a different personalities,” she 
said. “I think it’s boring to 
reciprocate just what I’ve been 
through. Inspiration can come 
anywhere.” 

Whether derived from per-

sonal experiences and emotions 
or purely fictitious, Xylem’s 
content includes prose, poetry, 
short stories and occasional art-
work. Due to its contingency on 
student submissions, at the root 
of Xylem stems an admirable 
authenticity, each piece distinc-
tively delivered in the author’s 
emotive voice.

“I think the unique voice is 

that it doesn’t really have one,” 
Grewal said. “It doesn’t attempt 
to be anything super unified 
other than a platform for stu-
dents to get their work out 
there.”

As a platform for writers 

ranging from burgeoning poets 
to Hopwood winners, Xylem 
fosters a pedagogical environ-

ment for all skill sets. 

Prefacing each issue is Oxford 

English Dictionary’s definition 
of “xylem”: “n. Collective term 
for the cells, vessels, and fibres 
forming the harder portion of 
the fibrovascular tissue; the 
wood, as a tissue of the plant-
body.”

Which raises the question: 

what’s in the name? That’s a 
question even Salka and Grewal 
ask themselves. From a meta-
phorical standpoint, it’s clever 
— just a group of typists, sowing 
the seeds of their efforts, reap-
ing the benefits of their work 
with each tangible copy of the 
journal. Yet, to the publication’s 
two figureheads, any definition 
offered is seen as contrived. 
Salka’s been trying to solve the 
mystery since she joined the 
staff her freshman year. 

“No one knows, that is the 

biggest mystery,” Salka said. 
“That’s the first thing I asked 
the editor in chief when I start-
ed and she was like ‘no idea.’ ”

Though their roots may not 

be clear, Xylem exists as an 
abstract outlet for students like 
Grewal and Salka, who explore 
the creative pursuits that are 
often limited in the classroom 
setting.

Salka has seen the publication 

grow over the years, but its lead-
ers maintain it has remained 
a place for students to express 
themselves.

“We accept more work and we 

accept more high-quality work,” 
Salka said. “We had two or three 
times as many submissions this 
year than last year. We have 
the luxury of being more picky 
when we get more options.”

Grewal happened into Xylem 

by a turn of events, after stum-
bling upon their submissions 
advertisement 
featuring 
an 

open editor position. She came 
to the University with inten-
tions 
of 
a 
pre-med-related 

major, but a service trip to Nica-
ragua completely changed her 
mind, resulting in her pursuit 
of a dual degree in English and 
economics.

“I realized I was way too emo-

tional to be a doctor,” she said. 

Not only did the trip deflect 

her academic path, but her pho-
tos taken on the trip resulted 
in her photo essay submission 
for Xylem, for which she was 
accepted into the magazine.

“We were all so impressed by 

that, by the way,” Salka added.

As for Salka, Xylem simply 

seemed an enjoyable addition 
to her Business and Screen Arts 
and Cultures majors. The cur-
rent finance and publications 
chair has been a part of the pub-
lication since her freshman year.

After the entire board of last 

year graduated, Salka was the 
only remaining editorial board 
member when Grewal assumed 
the position of editor in chief. 
Prospects were bleak in her 
eyes, as she doubted the journal 
could replace the graduated tal-
ent. 

During the fall, the pair often 

met at Elixir Vitae, where Gre-
wal was constantly reassured 
by Salka’s optimistic outlook.

“I have blind faith; I’m sorry,” 

Salka joked. “I kept telling her, 
‘I’m sure we’ll find people.’ ” 

Sure enough, Salka was right. 

At the mass meeting, it was just 
the two of them, pitching the 
publication to an eager crowd of 
students. Seeing as she under-
estimated the turnout, Grewal’s 
only regret was that she didn’t 
bring enough cookies. 

“I found myself staring into 

this sea of people that I wasn’t 
expecting to show up at Mason 
Hall,” she recalled. 

In terms of the yearly logis-

tical timeline, Xylem begins 
advertising for submissions in 
two waves, one shortly before 
Thanksgiving 
and 
one 
just 

before Winter Break, allotting 
aspiring 
contributors 
ample 

time to create. The magazine 
generally closes submissions 
during the first week of Janu-
ary, and layout is finalized in 
late winter. Throughout the 
early spring, all components 
are sent to the publishers.

“First semester is all about 

generating interest and letting 
people know we’re accepting,” 
Grewal said.

She initially found the task 

daunting and assumed it a dif-
ficult venture to find eager con-
tributors, but alas her doubts 
absolved.

“People are eager to get their 

work published,” she said. 

In terms of what they get 

out of their Xylem experience, 
Grewal and Salka concluded 
the submissions team meet-
ings as invaluable in their pro-
gression as writers. The group 
meets in early January for what 
Grewal describes as “mega-
discussions” of the potential 
content 
for 
each 
upcoming 

issue. The lengthy submissions 
meetings last five to six hours, 
during which the team assesses 
the strengths and weaknesses 
of each piece from a literary 
standpoint. 
Group 
members 

are expected to read each piece 
beforehand, all of which are 
put in a Google Doc without 
names, in order to avoid bias 
When one’s own work is the 
topic of discussion, the writer 
is not allowed to speak on it, 
but rather listen intently to the 
commentary. 

“As a board member, your 

analytical abilities and your 
method of finding something 
valuable in someone’s creative 
work really comes into play,” 
Grewal said.

The team was smaller than 

years past, as Grewal wanted 
to emphasize consistency and 
avoid past mistakes that came 
with a larger, unreliable team.

“In the past, there’s been 

issues 
with 
people 
having 

this huge amount of interest 
upfront, or they say they’re 
super excited and they don’t 
follow through and I didn’t 
want to treat student creative 
work with that level of respect,” 
Grewal said.

The workshop-style meet-

ings create an environment for 
individual writers to improve 
their 
style, 
as 
submissions 

are dissected for their liter-
ary elements, which are then 
campaigned for by dedicated 
supporters or rejected by vocif-
erous critics.

“It’s really easy to read a 

book that’s won four prizes and 
be like, ‘Wow this is great writ-
ing, how do I do this?” Grewal 
said. “There’s no entry point 
to figure out how to write like 
that. You get better as a writer, 

as an artist, by reading work 
that’s still a little rough around 
the edges and putting your own 
opinion in.”

“Critically analyzing some-

one else’s work helps you find 
the faults in your own writing,” 
Salka added. “If we were split 
on a certain piece or someone 
felt really strongly about it, 
we would let them make their 
case.”

With thoughtful consider-

ation and helpful criticism, the 
60-some selected works rep-
resent a combination of excel-
lent writing and the essence 
of 
Xylem. 
Though 
entirely 

student-run, 
the 
publication 

exudes a unique professional-
ism that’s reflected in its pre-
sentation, described by Grewal 
as “something you would buy 
in a store.” This year’s cohe-
sive cover design includes etch-
ings of phantom-esque figures, 
with a back cover showing them 
walking away.

Though a date has yet to 

be decided (they’re looking at 
the weekend of the April 17), 
Xylem plans to host their annual 
launch party at Literati Book-
store, the kitschy bookseller on 
East Washington Street. While 
serving to distribute the maga-
zine, the event also presents an 
opportunity for writers to bring 
their works to life as they read 
them aloud, with intended tone 
and emotion that may not have 
translated over text. 

As 
with 
most 
creative 

endeavors, there’s a lot of cli-
chés attached to writing. So in 
the theme of our discussion, 
reviving our love-hate feelings 
towards clichés, I closed the 
interview with a cliché ques-
tion. 

“What’s the best part about 

Xylem?” I asked.

Salka replied succinctly, stat-

ing, “The best part is the people 
you’re with.”

As for Grewel, she gave me an 

admittedly clichéd answer.

“Maybe the book is the best 

part, but this is going to sound 
so cliché, I hope you’re ready … 
just everything along the way,” 
she said.

By the end of the interview, 

out of all the trials and tribula-
tions of writing we had previ-
ously agreed on, there was one 
more — they’re clichés for a 
reason.

TV REVIEW
‘Mad Men’ premiere 
is sluggish at work

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO

Senior Arts Editrix

Severance, as it turns out, 

in the eponymous mid-season 
premiere of “Mad Men” ’s final 
season, is less easily achieved 
than 
one 
expects. 
Indeed, 

the 
episode 

shows 
how 

the characters 
remain 
as 

bound to their 
corporate 
identities 
as 

ever, 
with 

little 
promise 

for respite in 
the last seven 
episodes. 
And 

on 
a 
meta-level, 
severance 

eludes the audience, who feel 
stuck back in the thematic mud 
of early “Mad Men” — less like 
an homage and more like a déjà 
vu that refuses to leave. 

Where once Don Draper 

(Jon 
Hamm, 
“Bridesmaids”) 

plumbed 
the 
less-than-

glamorous 
depths 
of 

alcoholism, the thick veneer of 
advertising coats everything 
in “Severance.” Way back in 
season five, Draper’s fall from 
corporate grace was poised 
to offer a phoenix-style rise 
from the ashes. But in typical 
“Mad 
Men” 
style, 
Draper’s 

whorehouse past has simply 
been repurposed into another 
tool of the trade — in this case, 
to seduce a young model. 

The episode’s strength is 

in showing how entrenched 
Draper’s life is in advertising. 
In its opener, we see him in the 
midst of a psychological mind 
fuck (the type that typically 
prefaces his brand of sex). Then 
the camera pulls back to reveal 
it’s just a hyper-sexualized 
casting call. 

And reunited as the ultimate 

wingmen, Sterling (John Slattery, 
“The Adjustment Bureau”) and 
Draper are living in the financial 
excesses of their McCann buyout. 
While a brooding discontent 
with civilization characterized 
late-series “Mad Men” (think 
of season five’s string of visual 
death metaphors like the empty 
elevator 
shaft), 
“Severance” 

evokes its old brand of cynicism 
— one in which the rewards are 
reaped and the pathos is swept 
under the shag rug. 

But just as Peggy (Elisabeth 

Moss, 
“Girl, 
Interrupted”) 

cryptically suggests to a client, 
“I’d never recommend imitation 
as a strategy,” perhaps this 
circularity is intentional. After 
all, “Severance” is laced with 
callbacks: Draper’s latest is a 
fur client, and ingenue Rachel 
Katz née Menken (Maggie Siff, 
“Sons of Anarchy”) reappears 
in a dream to model it for him. 
She dies the next day, and all 
of Draper’s attempts to extract 
meaning from that well grooved 
symbolic network of brunette-

cum-mother-cum-whorehouse 
figures run dry. 

Where narration is telling 

Don old metaphors run out of 
significance, other characters 
like Ken (Aaron Staton, “L.A. 
Noire”) are running head-on 
against the narrative fates. After 
his father-in-law retires, his 
wife urges him to quit the job 
that he can afford to quit and 
write the book he should have 
been writing. The next day, 
internal politics lead to Ken’s 
firing, providing the deus ex 
machina that eludes Don this 
episode. Rather than yielding to 
the direction fate is channeling 
him into, he yields to pettiness 
and takes his father-in-law’s 
old job — purely to torture his 
ex-colleagues.

Other characters are chained 

to their stakes: Peggy flirts 
with escaping to Paris with a 
promising date, but can’t find 
her passport. Of course, it turns 
up in her office desk. You can 
leave work in “Mad Men,” in the 
literal sense, but figuratively, 
it’s a whole different story.

SINGLE REVIEW

 “Whip It” first made an 
appearance as the fun-but-
forgettable opening track on 
ILoveMa-
konnen’s 
Drink More 
Water 4 
mixtape 
in 2014. It 
featured 
the rap-
per’s now 
trademark 
wavery and 
wobbly flow 
as he play-
fully free-styled over a poorly 
mixed beat and said “whip it” a 
shit ton of times. 
But 2015 is a new year, Drink 
More Water 5 is a new mixtape 
and “Whip It (Remix)” is a new 
banger. This remix features a 
reworked Makonnen verse and 
a newly remastered beat. Most 
notable, though, is the employ-
ment of rappers Migos and Rich 

the Kid. With verses more catchy 
than Makonnen’s, the fellow 
Atlanta rappers add a new energy 
to the track, giving it that this 
could actually play at a party feel 
that some ILoveMakonnen songs 
just don’t have. 
But, the hook – “teach me how 
to whip it, teach me how to whip 
it” – doesn’t have the strength to 

carry the song. And Makonnen’s 
characteristically choppy delivery 
sounds a little too jagged, leaving 
us with little to latch on to, little 
to hum in our heads a couple min-
utes after the first listen. 
Still, no one can resist a good 
Migos feature

TRAILER REVIEW

 Trailer #1 for “Ex Machina” 
is the perfect example of a trailer 
that gives just enough informa-
tion about the film. We glean 
scraps of 
the initial 
premise – 
there are two 
computer 
scientists, 
and they’re 
working on 
a danger-
ously human-
seeming 
female A.I. 
We know Oscar Isaac and Domn-
hall Gleeson are in it — that’s 
enough to get us to see pretty 
much anything. And, thanks to 
the trailer’s nervous pace, we 
know that it’s going to be very, 

very intense. 
We don’t learn much else, and 
that’s a good thing. In the age of 
trailers spoiling the most impor-
tant parts of the film, the “Ex 

Machina” trailer stands as an 
excellent example of how to truly 
bait the audience with mystery.

Cover designer 
talks new edition

Stephane Mallarme 

gets a revamped 

cover for new 
translation

 

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writer

Like the oceans of waste we 

pump out every day, there are 
faraway graveyards of thrown-
away 
books, 
untouched 
or 

unseen 
for 
millennia. 
The 

carcasses of discarded volumes 
form the very ground on which 
we walk and stuff the furniture 
on which we sit. Geologists 
have 
determined 
that 
the 

combustion in the bowels of 
the Earth is powered not by 
the 
decay 
of 
uranium-238 

and potassium-40, but by an 
inferno of trammeled copies of 
GQ and Teen Vogue. Rummage 
sales are the mass execution 
yards where John Grisham dies 
a million deaths in effigy. 

It is easy to forget that text 

and books have not always 
been 
so 
disposable, 
given 

the ubiquity of mass-market 
paperbacks and an amount of 
digitally published text much 
larger than any person could 
ever possibly read. In contrast 
with the decadent, gimmicky 
“deluxe 
editions” 
you 
see 

coming 
out 
of 
publishers 

like Penguin, there are many 
traditions of textual production 
that do much more in terms of 
substantively thinking through 
the relationship between text, 
image and the book as physical 
object. 

This 
sets 
the 
stage 
for 

Stephane Mallarme and the 
retranslation of his major late 
work “Un coup de Des jamais 
n’abolira le hasard” (“A Roll of 
the Dice Will Never Abolish 
Chance”) 
from 
Seattle-based 

Wave Books. A 19th-century 
French poet (1842-1898) in the 
league of Charles Baudelaire and 
Arthur Rimbaud, Mallarme held 
massive influence through his 
poetry, his prose and criticism, 
his editorial work on various 
publications, including a short-
lived fashion magazine, and 
his salons. The regulars of his 
philosophical, literary meetings 
included Paul Verlaine, W.B. 
Yeats and Rainer Maria Rilke. 
Many critics of the 20th and 
21st centuries hold him up as 
an antecedent of some of the 
most 
important 
theoretical 

developments in critical theory 
and literary criticism. 

His poem, “A Roll of the 

Dice,” 
is 
a 
“typographical 

extravaganza,” to use Brian Kim 
Stefans’s phrase from his review 
of French philosopher Quentin 
Meillassoux’s 2012 “The Number 
and the Siren: a Decipherment 
of Mallarme’s Coup de Des.” 
Mallarme’s instructions for the 
1897 edition to his publisher, 
Vollard, 
were 
meticulous 

and exacting, although never 
executed either in his lifetime or 
after except for one undertaking 
in 2004 and, now, the efforts of 
translator Robert Bononno and 
Ypsilanti-based translator and 
designer Jeff Clark (Quemadura 
Studio). They bring Mallarme’s 
radical vision to life in their 
powerful and beautiful edition.

The words are set in different 

sizes, 
italicized 
or 
not, 
in 

descending 
and 
scattered 

movements across the page. 
“The ‘white spaces’ (les blancs), 
in effect, assume importance, 
are the first that strike our 
eyes; versification has always 
required them, usually as an 
encompassing silence, such that 
a poem ... occupies, centered, 
about a third of the page: I don’t 
disregard this method, merely 

disperse it,” Mallarme says in 
the preface to his poem. In some 
literary historical accounts, this 
emphasis on movement and 
speed anticipates the Futurist 
and 
Dadaist 
avant-garde 

movements of the twentieth 
century. 

Taking his cue from the 

Mallarme’s 
instructions 
for 

the 
Vollard 
edition, 
Clark 

substitutes 
the 
“vaguely 

nautical” 
lithographs 
by 

Odilon 
Redon 
with 
his 

own 
illustrations. 
These 

illustrations, he explains, are 
“randomly-lit, 
burst-mode 

photographs 
of 
black-and-

white laserprints” that lend an 
impersonal and austere air to 
Bonanno and Clark’s impressive 
translation. The result, coupled 
with 
the 
“extended 
weight 

of Helvetica” that Clark opts 
for in the English text, is a 
gorgeous work that prompts 
questions of aesthetic unity 
involving the book itself as an 
aesthetic object. All the while, 
these 
questions 
are 
given 

body and made exciting in 
their eminently recognizable 
contemporary English. 

Mallarme 
consciously 

positioned his literary project, 
embodied both in “A Roll 
of the Dice” and his thirty-
year-in-the-making 
“utopian 

enterprise” 
titled 
simply 

“Le Livre” (The Book), as a 
sort of atheist inheritance of 
what David Roberts calls the 
“Catholic tradition of mystery” 
in his book “The Total Work of 
Art in European Modernism.” It 
was through a “numerologically 
structured ceremony of public 
reading” 
that 
Mallarme 

sought 
“to 
found 
a 
new 

poetic religion that would be 
secular modernity’s answer to 
Christianity,” says Adam Kotsko 
in The New Inquiry.

Roberts also describes how 

Mallarme’s 
aim 
stands 
in 

contrast with another aesthetic 
paradigm of 19th century – 
Richard Wagner’s concept of 
the total work of art, or the 
Gesamtkunstwerk. 
Wagner 

sought 
to 
unify 
all 
modes 

of 
aesthetic 
representation 

in the theater through his 
ambitious 
operatic 
works. 

Mallarme, by contrast, aspired 
to the creation of a book that 
incorporated 
everything 

through 
an 
act 
of 
poetic 

“dematerialization, abstraction, 
and generalization,” Roberts 
says. But if their ideas are 
antithetical (and again, this 
is an incredibly complicated 
debate that I can’t delve into 
here), they at least share a 
drive toward unity and totality. 
Everything was made in order 
to end up in a book, Mallarme 
remarked in conversation with 
Jules Huret, which our same 
Orhan Pamuk cited in a 2008 
interview with Carol Becker in 
the Brooklyn Rail.

Although 
Mallarme 

worked “(to invent) a style 
of critical prose as well as 
poetry” 
that 
emphasizes 

“ellipses, 
discontinuities, 

and 
obscurities,” 
Barbara 

Johnson explains in her review 
of a biography of Mallarme 
in 
the 
London 
Review 
of 

Books, “(this) is not to say 
that 
Mallarme’s 
late, 
most 

stylistically radical books have 
nothing to do with the desire 
for coherence.” “(Along) with 
his fragmentation of all the 

usual modes of meaning, he also 
imagined that ‘The Book’ would 
put everything back together 
in a higher synthesis. This 
impersonal, prismatic, grand 
oeuvre would also be a key to 
all mythologies, the ‘Orphic 
explanation of the earth.’”

This is what’s at stake when 

Clark approaches this book 
as a designer. His task is to 
animate Mallarme’s ambitions 
through the interplay between 
translation, 
typography, 

illustration 
and 
how 
these 

are all packaged in the book’s 
overall design. And it is crucial 
to note that Mallarme’s hopes 
play out in real-life, material 
books.

“The reason ‘A Roll of the 

Dice’ 
and 
its 
presentation 

are 
different 
from 
highly 

collectible, lavishly produced 
book-of-the-month 
club 

limited edition type stuff is 
that Mallarme was fussing over 
trim size and paper stock and 
typography because he placed 
a lot of hope in this particular 
poem. And so not only every 
word of this poem was hyper 
sought-out by him and agonized 
over, but he carried that sort of 
intensive work into the actual 
material embodiment of the 
book,” Clark said. 

The final product of Clark and 

Bonnono’s labors is a vindication 
of books whose physicality and 
materiality have something to 
say, books that are more than 
chic “fetish objects” (Clark’s 
words). But this is not done in the 
service of a large profit margin, 
as partly illustrated by how 
Mallarme’s “fussing” over the 
paper and typeface of his book no 
doubt exasperated his publisher. 
Mallarme’s poem, and Clark and 
Bonnono’s amazing rendering 
of it, confronts questions of the 
possibility of totality in art and 
how this process plays out on an 
object made out of ink-spattered 
paper glued to cardboard that 
circulates in a market. 

“Hopefully she (the reader) 

will come away with a sense 
that every part of the book is 
yet another extrapolation of 
the ideas that are at stake in the 
poem itself,” Clark said.

MUSIC COLUMN

Tidal and the future 

of free music

I 

was in Indianapolis this 
past weekend, and while 
I thought the city was 

fantastic, I was frustrated by 
one thing: I didn’t see a single 
drinking 
fountain 
over the 
course of 
my entire 
visit.

I hated 

having to 
do it, but 
multiple 
times I was 
forced to 
pay $3 for a bottle of water 
from one of the many food 
vendors set up throughout the 
city. I wished I could get the 
plain old hydration I needed 
from a free source, but instead, 
I had to shell out for purified 
Aquafina.

What does this have to 

do with music? I’ll let Jay 
Z explain. Last week, when 
he and the rest of the music 
Illuminati rolled out Tidal, a 
new streaming service that 
promises high-quality audio 
and will only be available with 
a paid subscription, he showed 
a desire to make the music 
industry more like the bottled 
water industry.

“If a person can pay $6 for a 

bottle of water, something that 
used to be free, if someone can 
do that? I can definitely show 
you why you should pay for 
Lauryn Hill’s album. There 
are 14 reasons, it’s incredible. 
Someone’s changed our 
mindset to believe that that 
bottle of water is worth $6,” 
he said.

Hov is right. While Big 

Bottled Water has changed 
the game so now we don’t 
even blink when we pay a few 
bucks for their product, the 
music industry has completely 
lost control of the idea that 
music should cost money. CD 
sales have been falling for 
years with no end in sight, but 
now even digital downloads 
are dropping. And as iTunes 
loses its business to Spotify, 
a mostly free service that 
typically pays artists pennies 
— even for thousands of plays. 
According to Jay Z in his Tidal 
press conference, Aloe Blacc 
was only paid $4,000 for a song 
(“The Man”) that was streamed 
168 million times.

As the market for music gets 

bleaker, it makes perfect sense 
that musicians would rebel. 
Taylor Swift — potentially 

the biggest star music has 
right now — pulled her entire 
catalogue off Spotify last year, 
citing a lack of significant 
payment, and in the wake 
of Tidal, Jay Z has pulled 
Reasonable Doubt, his first 
and arguably finest album, 
from Spotify. These moves 
ostensibly make the artists’ 
work inaccessible to those who 
don’t want to pay for it.

The problem, though, is 

that in the Internet age it’s 
impossible for any artist to 
close all channels of access. 
Here, Reasonable Doubt is 
available for listening in 
its entirety on YouTube. A 
commenter was even nice 
enough to provide links to the 
beginning of each song within 
the whole video. And though 
Taylor Swift and her lawyers 
are much more proactive 
about keeping her music away 
from cheap fans (nothing on 
YouTube except official music 
videos and interviews), Swift 
is so popular that the efforts 
are futile. Search 1989 on the 
world’s most famous torrent 
site and you’ll find dozens 
of copies of her most recent 
album, just waiting to be 
downloaded for free.

The only way it seems that 

artists can force their fans to 
pay for music is if the artist 
is too obscure for anyone to 

bother posting free copies. 
Take Lifter Puller, a late-
’90s cult punk outfit from 
Minneapolis that eventually 
became The Hold Steady. 
When I first got into the 
band, I scanned the Internet 
for download links to Lifter 
Puller’s discography and found 
nothing. A few hours later, I 
was downloading Half Dead 
and Dynamite and Fiestas and 
Fiascos from the Amazon Store.

I certainly don’t regret my 

purchase, but I understand 
how, for those to whom music 
is almost as essential as water, 
the cost can really start to add 
up. I don’t blame musicians in 
the least for wanting their work 

to be sold, not stolen, but given 
the choice between a bottled 
water vendor and a drinking 
fountain around the corner, 
where are you going to drink?

Music will always find a 

way to get to those who want 
to listen to it. Back in the 
Soviet Union, way before the 
Internet, Beatles’ records were 
illicitly distributed on old x-ray 
films and played on modified 
record players. Kevin Bacon 
brought dancing to a rural 
town that outlawed rock music. 
And practically anyone with 
a computer and an Internet 
connection can download 
whatever music they want and 
circumvent any advertisements 
or paywalls they don’t wish to 
be stuck behind. Nobody wants 
to steal from their favorite 
musicians, but when you’re on 
a budget and it’s just so damn 
easy, it’s tough to resist the 
temptation.

We’re past the point where 

artists can sell millions of 
records in their first week of 
release, but we still have no 
idea where music is going to 
go from here. Maybe for her 
next project, Taylor Swift will 
bypass her record company 
and release an album straight 
to Bandcamp. Or maybe Jay 
Z and Beyoncé’s collaborative 
record will be a Tidal exclusive 
and everyone with an aversion 
to torrenting will have to pony 
up for a subscription. Perhaps 
the follow-up to Yeezus will 
be a cassette tape delivered 
by Amazon’s drones. This 
is a very exciting time for 
experimentation, not just in 
music itself, but in the medium 
through which it’s delivered.

Tidal could be a huge 

flop, but if it’s good enough, 
maybe it could be embraced 
as a legitimate alternative to 
Spotify. If artists keep trying to 
rethink how music is delivered 
and disseminated, it’s possible 
that fans will embrace one of 
these methods that force them 
to pay a few extra dollars out of 
a love of music and musicians. 
In short, maybe Tidal will 
get over the pretentiousness 
of its initial rollout and Jay Z 
will become the next Kevin 
Bacon, ushering in a new era 
of music consumption. And if 
that doesn’t happen, maybe our 
next businessman/artist with a 
vision will.

Hardworking blues 

rock guitarist a 
force in the local 

scene

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

Laith Al-Saadi is always play-

ing music. From Mondays at The 
Arena Sportsbar from 10:30 p.m. 
to 2:00 a.m. to playing solo acous-
tic Tuesdays at the Black Pearl 
from 8:00 to 11:00, then being 
at Weber’s Inn every Thursday 
from 8:45 p.m. until 12:45 a.m., 
the Ann Arbor native lives a life 
full of blues, jazz and rock music. 
He takes at least two road trips 
a month, spreading his music to 
other Michigan locales like Tra-

verse City and to states such as 
California and New Orleans. Sit-
ting down with the local guitarist 
and singer, I asked him when he 
decided to take this path. 

“I don’t think I decided that. I 

think it was necessary because I 
was so committed to making my 
living as a performer and doing 
nothing else,” Al-Saadi said.

For him, it started at Commu-

nity High School in Ann Arbor, 
where his band leader, Mike 
Grace, would let the best play-
ers, as jazz combos, go out and 
play gigs in the area. The young 
Al-Saadi found himself playing 
three to four night a week at Uni-
versity receptions and banquets 
at venues like Weber’s Inn that 
would become familiar stomp-
ing grounds for the 37-year-old 
musician.

“We didn’t make a lot of 

money, but we did make money 
off of those things, and we got 
the ethic that the work was out 
there if we hustled and got it. 
That really resonated strongly 
because I’ve never had a real job 
since I turned 16 and was able to 
drive. When I got my license, I 
quit my job at Briarwood and I 
had a car that could get the PA 
system around; I started booking 
my band on weekends and play-
ing during the week and that’s 
it.”

Since then Al-Saadi has con-

tinued to play and develop the 
musical style that was originally 
sparked listening to his older 
sisters’ Beatles records when he 
was a kid.

“I gravitated towards music of 

the late ’60s, early ’70s primarily 
when I was a kid and I liked the 
Beatles. Then I got into Cream 
and I got into Jimi Hendrix and 
Led Zeppelin. When I started 
playing guitar and learning that 
stuff, I found that the guitar play-
ers I most liked were really into 
blues and were mostly blues play-
ers. Even when I was a kid I was 
gravitating towards the music 
of Ray Charles and Louis Arm-
strong, stuff that had a strong 
Blues component and spiritual 
and gospel components as well, 
as far as harmonies and that stuff 
go. From there I went to BB King 
and Buddy Guy, then I got into 
the guys I think I’m more into 
today, once I dug a little deeper: 
the Albert Kings, Elmore James 
and Danny Gatton (who is one of 
my favorite guitarists),” Al-Saadi 
said.

It’s fascinating to listen to 

Al-Saadi talk about music and 
his influences. Lists of bands 
and musicians tie together with 
thoughts about locations that 
possess their own styles, which 
he then weaves into a completely 
new list of artists. From these 
threads, Al-Saadi’s words weave 
a rich tapestry, capturing years of 
blues and jazz history that span 
several regions of unique music. 

One 
such 
region 
is 
New 

Orleans, where Al-Saadi wrote 

three of the songs (“Gone,” “The 
Last Time You’ll See Me Cry” and 
“What It Means”) that appear on 
his latest album Real, released in 
2013. The album was produced 
by Grammy winning producer 
Jeffrey Weber, who Al-Saadi met 
when he was playing down in Los 
Angeles. Recorded straight to two 
track with no overdubs or editing, 
the album is representative of Al-
Saadi’s constant live performing.

“I think that most of the 

records that I love the most were 
that way, and trying to make 
recordings in the past, you’re try-
ing to capture this energy of what 
happens in a live performance 
and make that translate,” Al-Saa-
di said. “Especially when you’re 
playing music of the moment, 
music 
that 
is 
improvisation 

based, where people are listen-
ing and responding to stuff that is 
happening at the time, that’s the 
only way to capture it.”

Real is bolstered by the pres-

ence of prominent session musi-
cians such as Larry Goldings, 
Leland Sklar and Jim Keltner in 
the rhythm section and Conan 
O’Brien’s band leader, Jimmy 
Vivino, who flew out from New 
York to play in the nine-hour 
recording session at the Ocean 

Way Recording Studio in Holly-
wood. 

“I didn’t ask for Paul McCart-

ney and didn’t ask for people of 
that level, but the guys I did ask 
for were my favorite session play-
ers and heroes,” Al-Saadi said. 
“I didn’t really have an expecta-
tion that they would say yes, and 
we got every single person who 
was my first choice. I think by 
the time the players lined up, the 
other players getting involved in 
the session were more excited 
about doing it.”

Besides the New Orleans, Delta 

and spiritual roots on Real, there 
is the presence of Chicago Blues 
in songs like, “How It’s Gonna 
Be,” which Al-Saadi describes as 
influenced by Howling Wolf and 
Koko Taylor. Along with that is 
a cover of The Band’s “Ophelia,” 
a tribute to the late Levon Helm, 
to whom Al-Saadi dedicated the 
album.

Looking to his future, Al-Saadi 

is looking forward to continuing 
to perform live, notably April 17 at 
the Magic Bag with Jimmy Vivi-
no, who has co-headlined shows 
with Al-Saadi. He also plans to 
get back in the studio as soon as 
he can.

“I would say in the next year 

or two you will likely see a solo 
acoustic project from me and also 
another live to two track blues-
rock album. I’m always writing,” 
Al-Saadi said about his plans for 
new albums.

However, the veteran perform-

er cautions about the future of the 
art of live performance, particu-
larly within Ann Arbor.

“I have witnessed the change 

of live band to DJ take place, I’ve 
witnessed the demise of live ven-
ues in town. I remember when 
Rick’s American Cafe had great 
music and that was one of the best 
spots in town to play, that brought 
in great blues acts and stuff. Then 
it switched to dollar pitchers and 
DJs and stopped offering any-
thing of any quality and I feel like 
that’s where we’re at right now,” 
he said. “There’s so few venues 
in town with stages ... I think in 
order for things to change and 
to be able to support talent-wise 
what’s out there we need more 
venues in town and we need peo-
ple to actually realize that they 
have to go out in order to support 
that stuff and make it happen.”

In the meantime, Laith Al-

Saadi will keep playing his guitar 
late into the night and on into the 
next day.

EVENT PREVIEW
M-Agination festival 
presents student films

By GRACE HAMILTON

Daily Arts Writer

In this year’s M-agination 

Student Film Festival, an exper-
imental 
music 
video 
called 

“Legs” is just 
three minutes 
of 
dancing 

lower 
limbs, 

legs 
commu-

nicating 
with 

each 
other. 

Another 
one 

of the films is 
a sitcom pilot, 
following a pair 
of feisty twins 
as they wreak 
havoc through their boarding 
school by orchestrating a cheat-
ing business. Several of the films 
this year are musicals. 

The 
M-agination 
produc-

ers are a board of 16 senior and 
associate members, all students. 
While most of them are study-
ing film, other majors are rep-
resented, such as the sciences. 
They are responsible for putting 
out the call for scripts each year, 
deciding among the 30 to 40 
usual submissions and putting 
together teams to make each 
film. 

“It’s all about story and how 

do you tell a good story in an 
interesting way?” said Presi-
dent Anna Baumgarten, an LSA 
senior. “We like to avoid cliché; 
there are ways to put a spin on 
things that we’ve seen before. 
It’s really about human con-
nection, so good writing, even 
with tropes we’ve seen before 
like romance, can really make a 
difference. The writing comes 
through and you feel it.”

There are other things that 

help Baumgarten and the other 
producers filter through stories. 
In narrative films, the producers 
evaluate pacing, writing, the feel 

of the dialogue and how engag-
ing the story is.

“Another thing we look for is 

producability. Are there creative 
ways to get it done? If it’s shot on 
the moon, can we shoot that and 
how do we do it? Resources are 
important,” she said. 

After scripts are chosen, the 

writers typically become the 
directors. Then, the producers 
put out a crew call that anyone 
within the University is wel-
come to attend. There, writers/
directors have the opportunity 
to pitch their script. During this 
meeting, other students may sign 
up for crew roles on the films. 
And M-agination is open to all 
students and all ideas. 

“It’s the only film organization 

on campus where you can submit 
any idea, and we will consider 
it,” Baumgarten said. “I like how 
open the format is; every produc-
er is assigned one of those scripts 
and productions, and they run 
their own little microorganism. 
Every production is different. 
There’s no set limit.” 

The 
unofficial 
mentorship 

program within the organiza-
tion also helps encourage less 
experienced students interested 
in film to get involved. Experi-
enced people are put in depart-
ment positions and partnered 
with newer crew members. This 
gives something to people that 
film classes can’t. 

“When you’re in a production 

class, you’re with kids your same 
age and experience. Learning 
from (older students’) points of 
views of art has been so reward-
ing,” Baumgarten says. 

This 
kind 
of 
mentorship 

fosters a strong sense of col-
laboration among M-agination 
members. It’s a theme that both 
Baumgarten and Vice President 
Anthony Kalil, an LSA Senior 
mention more than once. 

“There are a lot of very tal-

ented and creative people associ-
ated with our group and the best 
works we see each year come 
from groups who fostered a safe 
space for people to express their 
creativity collaboratively,” said

The collaboration that helps 

the filmmakers and producers 
improve their individual skills is 
also the driving force of a film’s 
beauty. 

“Film is the ultimate collabor-

ative art form. You have writers, 
designers, composers, acting; I 
can’t think of a single creative art 
form that it doesn’t include. Even 
if it’s non-narrative, you’re still 
conveying feeling and emotion. 
It’s so cool,” she said, laughing. 

The 
obsessive 
excitement 

often seen in people with par-
ticular 
passions, 
like 
com-

ics, Harry Potter books or, in 
this case, film, shines through 
Anna’s enthusiasm and ambi-
tion. Likewise, Kalil expresses 
the same sentiment towards the 
power of film. 

“The cinematography, sound 

design, costume design, acting 
and everything else all try to 
convey the story in their own 
way. There are a lot of proj-
ects this year in the M-agina-
tion Films Festival that have 
achieved the sort of artistic 
synchrony and I’m excited for 
everyone to see them. It’s beau-
tiful,” Kalil said. 

M-agination leaves its door 

open to all ideas and all faces. 
As part of the University Activ-
ity Center, everyone is techni-
cally a part of the organization, 
Baumgarten 
noted. 
If 
your 

form of getting involved isn’t 
grabbing a camera or writing a 
script, simply sit back in the the-
ater and let yourself be blown 
away. Remind yourself what stu-
dents are capable of.
