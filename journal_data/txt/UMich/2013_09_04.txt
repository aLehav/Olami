Ombuds serves
as middleman in
faculty conflicts
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Bruno Giordani, chief psy-
chologist in the University's
Department of Psychiatry and
professor of psychiatry, neu-
rology and psychology, began
his term as faculty ombuds,
the University's chief media-
tor, Sunday.
A faculty member at the
University for 26 years,
Giordani has a vast array
of experience in academia
and University governance.
Between 2005 to 2007, he was
chair and vice chair of the
Senate Advisory Committee
on University Affairs and for
12 years was the director of

the neuropsychology section
of the University Health Sys-
tem.
As ombuds, Giordani will
serve as amediator in conflicts
and as a liaison with stand-
ing to recommend changes in
policy or procedures to senior
University officials.
According to the faculty
ombuds website, ombuds -
which translates to "repre-
sentative" in Old Norse - is
a neutral official positioned
outside of an organization's
staff hierarchy. In their his-
torical role, ombuds have
provided a check on govern-
ment rulers in the interest of
a nation's citizens.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
CSG holds first
fall meeting

Assembly resolves
election issues,
clarifies rules
ByAMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily Staff Reporter
On Tuesday evening, the new
Central Student Government
assembly convened in the Michi-
gan Union for the second time
since the highly contested March
elections.
In additionto introducingnew
resolutions that clarified and
defined rules within student gov-
ernment - and re-addressing an
old resolution that opposed the
price increase to student season
football tickets - the assembly
looked upon a series of agenda
items.
After representatives who
were unable to attend the first
assembly meeting in April were
sworn into their positions, the
assembly voted to resolve the tie
in the election for the singular
representative seat available for
the School of Public Health.
In the March elections, four
students tied for the represen-
tative position, each garnering
one vote from their school. But,

because all four of those students
were absent at the meeting, the
assembly voted to leave the seat
vacant for the remainder of the
semester.
CSG President . Michael
Proppe, a Business senior, also
informed representatives of
developments between CSG and
the University that had taken
place over the summer, including
the push for more student input
in administrative decisions.
Proppe specifically referenced
the new general-admission
policy for home football games,
which was largely implemented
without advisement from Uni-
versity students.
Despite addressing the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents at its
May meeting, passing a CSG
resolution against the new pol-
icy and personally speaking to
Athletic Director Dave Brandon,
Proppe was unable to convince
the department to compromise
on the issue.
However, representatives
from the Athletic Department
will address the assembly on
Sept. 17 to discuss its reasoning
behind the policy and address
concerns.

Commisions to focus

By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
DailyStaffReporter
The Central Student Government
has increased the number of task-
oriented commissions that exist
within its structure in order to grow
its ability to enact change on cam-
pus.
On Aug. 15, Business senior
Michael Proppe, CSG President,
issued executive orders to establish
two commissions - the Voice Your
Vote Commission and the Commis-
sion on Detroit Engagement - based
on the recommendations of CSG
affiliates and student-body mem-
bers.
The commissions, appointed by
the CSG president, exist within the
executive branch to conduct in-
depth studies on campus issues and
recommend solutions for consider-
ation.

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
No one would ever accuse
Notre Dame defensive tackle
Louis Nix III of being petite,
so Devin Funchess had to

catch himself after practice
Tuesday. The Fighting Irish
defense suffocated Michi-
gan last year, Funchess said,
because of their overpower-
ing front seven.
Funchess, a sophomore
tight end, said Notre Dame's
defensive line in particular
was especially fearsome, and
this year it returns two of
three starters.
"The D-line, all three of

those little guys right there -
" Funchess said, then stopped.
He raised his eyebrows. "Not
little," he said. "They're kinda
big."
Even that underplays the
size of the three Irish line-
men. Defensive end Sheldon
Day, the smallest of the bunch,
is 290, and he is dwarfed by
his teammates. The other end,
Stephon Tuitt is 6-foot-6, 312

Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad talks to the media about her record-setting swim from Cubato Florida on Tuesday, Sept.3.
Nyad: Maturity helped me
finish record-breaking swim


64-year-old swims
from Cuba to Fla.
without shark cage
KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) - The
clocks Diana Nyad uses to time
her training swims show that
she's a slower swimmer than she
used to be. That's only natural: At
age 64, she acknowledges she is
no longer the "thoroughbred stal-
lion" she was "back in the day."
And yet, the endurance ath-
lete says she felt stronger than
ever when she completed her
successful effort to become the
first person to swim 110 miles
from Cuba to Florida without a
shark cage.
"Now I'm more like a Clydes-
dale: I'm a little thicker and
stronger - literally stronger, I
can lift more weights," Nyad told
The Associated Press in a'one-
on-one interview Tuesday, a day
after she finished her 53-hour,
record-setting swim:
"I feel like I could walk
through a brick wall. ... I think
I'm truly dead center in the
prime of my life at 64."
Nyad isn't alone among aging
athletes who are dominating
their sports.
Earlier this year, 48-year-old
Beriard Hopkins became the

oldest boxer to win a major title,
scoring a 12-round unanimous
decision over Tavoris Cloud to
claim the IBF light heavyweight
championship.
Tennis player Martina Navra-
tilova played in the mixed dou-
bles competition at Wimbledon
in her late 40s, and hockey leg-
end Gordie Howe played in the
NHL in-his SOs.
Thousands of U.S. athletes,
including 60-year-old Kay
Glynn, also compete during the
Senior Olympics.
Glynn, of Hastings, Iowa,
has won six gold medals in pole
vaulting at the Senior Olympics
and set a new pole vaulting world
record for her age in the 2011
National Senior Games.
Older athletes tend to find
more success in endurance
events than power events such
as sprinting and other sports
that rely on "fast- twitch" muscle
fibers, which are more difficult
to preserve later in life, noted
Wojtek Chodzko-Zajko, a physi-
ologist at the University of Illi-
nois Urbana-Champaign.
But just because Nyad was
swimming rather than pounding
her joints against the concrete
doesn't mean she didn't achieve a
remarkable feat, Chodzko-Zajko
said. '
"This ultra, super-length

swimming is brutal regardless,"
he said, adding that another rea-
son athletes are able to endure is
because they often train smarter
and have a mental concentration
that is well honed over decades.
"She's one of any number of 4
people who are redefining what
happens with aging," said Dr.
Michael J. Joyner, an anesthesi-
ologist and exercise researcher
at Mayo Clinic.
"If you start with a highcapac-
ity, you have some reserves,"
Joyner said. "You can lose some
absolute power, but what you
lose in power you can make up
for with experience and strategy
and better preparation."
Nyad first attempted swim-
ming from Cuba to Florida at age
29with ashark cage. She didn't try
againuntil 2011 when she was 61.
She tried twice more in the
past two years before beginning
her fifth attempt Saturday morn-
ing with a leap off the seawall of
the Hemingway Marina into the
warm waters off Havana. She
paused occasionally for nourish-
ment, but never left the water
until she reached the white sand
beaches of the Keys and waded
ashore.
Nyad says her age and matu-
rity should not be discounted
when measuring her most recent
success.

Gov. Rick Snyder
embarks on third
trade trip to Asia
Gov. Rick Snyder on Wednes-
day will embark on his third
trade trip to Asia, this time with
an added focus on selling Michi-
gan as a destination to Chinese
S tourists.
The governor will begin the
10-day mission in China and
then go to Japan over the week-
end before returning to China for
more meetings next week with
senior government officials and
executives of some of the coun-
try's biggest companies.
Snyder said the focus on
attracting Chinese tourists is a
new one compared with similar
trade trips he took to the region
in 2011 and 2012. The delegation
plans to have receptions in two
Chinese cities to tout the state's
attractions with the "Pure Mich-
igan" tourism campaign.
DETROIT
State certifies
Detroit mayoral
primary election
Former Detroit Medical Center
CEO Mike Duggan won Detroit's
Aug. 6 mayoral primary by more
than 20,000 votes, according to
official results approved Tuesday
by state canvassers.
Tuesday's certification was
delayed two weeks after Wayne
County canvassers turned the job
overtothe state.
County canvassers refused to
count more than 24,000 write-
in ballots because city elections
workers used numeric counts
instead of hash marks to tally
them.
SAN FRANCISCO
Microsoft
acquires Nokia's
smartphone biz.
Microsoft's acquisition of
Nokia's troubled smartphone
business represents a daring $7.2
billion attempt by the software
giant and a once-influential cell-
phone maker to catch up with
. the mobile computing revolution
that threatens to leave them in
the technological dust.
The deal announced late Mon-
day offers both companies a
chance to make up for lost time
with a strategy to meld their soft-
ware and hardware into a cohe-
sive package, like rival Apple
has done. But there are plenty of
reasons to question whether the
copycat approach will pay off.
Unlike Apple, Microsoft Corp.
makes most of its money from
software for personal comput-
ers - a still-profitable franchise
that has gradually been crum-
bling as smartphones and tab-

lets supplant laptop and desktop
machines.- By some estimates,
more than two-thirds of the
computing devices being sold
now are either smartphones or
tablets, and there are few signs
that trend will change duringthe
next decade.
PYONGYANG
Rodman embarks
on second trip to
North Korea
Former NBA star Dennis Rod-
man landed Tuesday in North
Korea and said he plans to hang
outwith authoritarian leader Kim
Jong Un, have a good time and
maybe bridge some cultural gaps
- but not be a diplomat.
Rodman was greeted at Pyong-
yang's airport by Son Kwang Ho,
vice-chairman of North Korea's
Olympic Committee, just days
after Pyongyang rejected a visit
by a U.S. envoy who had hoped
to bring home Kenneth Bae, an
American missionary jailed there.
The North abruptly called off the
official visit because it said the
U.S. had ruined the atmosphere
M for talks by holding a drill over
South Korea with nuclear-capa-
ble B-52 bombers.

large real-estate development
firm based in New York City. He
graduated from the University of
Michigan's Business School in1962
and later went on to earn his J.D. at
Wayne State University in 1965.
Ross founded Related Companies in
1972 - which has since flourished
into a $15 billion enterprise.
As of March 2013, Ross' personal
net worth was valued by Forbes at
$4.4 billion. He is also the owner of
the Miami Dolphins football team.
The Ross School of Business is
no stranger to sizeable donations.
In 2004, Ross donated $100 million
for the school's extensive recon-
struction, which opened in 2009. In
honor of his contribution, the Board
of Regents voted in a special session
to rename the school after its larg-
est benefactor. Ross now serves as
chair for the upcoming capital cam-
paign, which will focus on extend-
ing greater financial aid.

Ross serves'on University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman's Advi-
sory Group in addition to the
Director's Cabinet in the Univer-
sity's Department of Intercolle-
giate Athletics. His other gifts to
the University include a $5 million
donation toward a new athletic aca-
demic center, $1 million to establish
a professorship in real estate at Ross
and'$50,000 to establish the Henry
Pearce Endowed Fellowship inLSA.
Wednesday's gift is only the lat-
est in a series of large donations to
the University as public universi-
ties increase their focus on private
donations due to lowered govern-
ment support in Michigan. During
the last few months, the University
has been the benefactor of several
gifts targeted at graduate programs,
housing and revamping certain
medical facilities. ,
In April, the University received
a $110 million donation from Alum
Charles Munger, the vice chair-
man of Berkshire Hathaway, to
build a graduate housing complex
at Division and Madison Streets, on

land where the Blimpy Burger res-
taurant and several rental houses
once stood. At the time, Munger's
gift topped only Ross' $100 million
gift to his now-namesake Business
School in 2004. Munger's donation
will help fund the $180 millionresi-
dence project and includes $10 mil-
lion for fellowships to help create a
residential community.
A $50-million donation from the
Zell Family Foundation, granted to
the LSA Master of Fine Arts in Cre-
ative Writing program, is the larg-
est donation in thatcollege's history.
The March donation, will help ease
the financial burden of those par-
ticipatinginthe program to ensure
they will have the resources to
continually practice and hone
their writing abilities.

million in March of this year. The

guys," Proppe said at the meet-
ing Tuesdaynight, assuringthe
representatives of their suc-
cess. "(The Athletic Depart-
ment) got some bad press on
it and now they are turning it
around."
Proppe also pointed to the
lack of student representatives
on the University Regent's
Presidential Search Advisory
Committee, saying there were
even more "serious, long term

implications" than the lack of
student input in ticketing poli-
cies.
Although the push to attain
student seats on the commit-
tee was not successful, Proppe
said the University Council
- a joint governing body com-
posed of presidents from the
student governments of all
University schools and col-
leges - will finalize steps to
gain more input on Sept. 9 in
a meeting with Regent Kath-
erine White.
Tuesday's agenda also
includdd an item to elect and

approve leadership positions
on executive and legislative
boards.
once selected, represen-
tatives were elected to hold
chair and vice chair posi-
tions on the four legislative
committee and the assembly
voted unanimously to con-
firm the executive nomina-
tion of Business senior Eric
Kibler for treasurer and LSA
senior Russ Hayes for chief
of staff. They will serve on
the executive branch beside
Proppe and CSG Vice Presi-
dent Bobby Dishell.


COMMISSIONS
From Page 1A
executive commissions were no
longer operational within the
dictates of the Constitution, CSG
President Michael Proppe and
Vice President Bobby Dishell
initially issued executive orders
in July to create 23 new "task-
oriented" commissions.
However, the reorganiza-
tion granted the executive
commissions additional flex-
ibility - allowing students to
recommend the establishment
of any additional commis-
sion to the executive branch if
they felt any campus issue was
underrepresented in student
government.
LSA senior Hayley Sakwa,
former vice presidential candi-
date from political party forUM
and proponent of the Commis-
sion on Detroit Engagement,
said the commission would
bring together student leaders
from various Detroit-based stu-
dent organizations to facilitate
collaboration.
"The missions and the goals

will really come from all of
the student organizations that
come together in that space,"
Sakwa said, citing better, low-
cost transportation amenities
between the University and
Detroit as a possible venture.
Available CSG funding would
help back the commissions'
pilot projects, she added.
Besides the collaborative and
programmatic function she said
she hopes the commission would
satisfy, Sakwa said the commis-
sion would more actively pres-
ent a "strong, cohesive, united
voice" to University administra-
tors where matters regarding
Detroit were concerned.
In an e-mail to the CSG com-
mission chairs and assembly
representatives, Proppe said an
attive Voice Your Vote Com-
mission would be important in
planning for the Ann Arbor City
Council elections in November
and begin the voter registration
processes for the Michigan elec-
tions that will take place the fol-
lowing year.
The commission, unlike
the Commission on Detroit
Engagement, existed within
last year's executive branch,

but Proppe said it was left out
of the initial executive orders
until he was aware of student
interest.
"Initially we left it off because
traditionally Voice Your Vote
has not been active when there
have not been national or state-
wide elections," Proppe said in
an interview. "But there were
some students who actually
wanted to leave the commission
active to (register students and
plan for the future)."
In the upcoming weeks,
the Executive Nominations
Committee will present their
recommendations for the can-
didates that will chair the
25 commissions. Currently,
Proppe and Dishell have sub-
mitted their nominations for
chair positions to the Execu-
tive Nominations Committee,
which is in the process of con-
ducting reviews.
As per the CSG Constitution,
the recommended candidates
will be inducted into their chair
positions to garner a simple
majority vote from the Assem-
bly. All commission chairs
will be confirmed by Sept. 23,
Proppe said.

pounds. He is an All-American.
In the middle, though, Nix's
size is unparalleled. He goes by
the name Irish Chocolate. He
is listed at 342 pounds. That is
exactly two Channing Striblings.
It's more than two Dennis Nor-
fleets.
Offensive coordinator Al Borg-
es said the defensive line will be
the toughest Michigan will face
this year. And as the Wolverines
prepare for it this week, they must
first solve one question: how do,
they replicate Nix?
One reporter asked Borges if.
Michigan would use one scout-
team player to simulate Nix or
two. He was only half joking.
Borges laughed.
"Boy, he is aload," Borges said.
"He's not easy to move."
Still, as Borges talked Tuesday,
inspiration struck.
"We'll find somebody," Borges
said. "Matter of fact, I have some-
body in mind as you speak. Not
going to say who."
Whomever Michigan picks,
he'll still be considerably light-
er than Nix. Borges said the
coaching staff prefers to keep
scout-team players at their nat-
ural positions. The Wolverines
have some hefty offensive line-
men, but less on the other side
of the ball. Michigan's bulkiest
defensive lineman is sophomore
Ondre Pipkins, at 315 pounds,
but he plays significant min-
utes. Redshirt junior Richard
Ash is 314 pounds, 28 less than
Nix.
Borges said scout-team players
take a certain pride in weeks like
this. Tuitt's double, for example,
must create some resemblance to
the All-American.
Fifth-year senior Quinton
Washington, Michigan's own,
smaller version of Nix, remem-
bers playing on the scout team
during Notre Dame week. Back
then, Washington was an offen-

sive lineman. He had to block
Brandon Graham.
"You could just tell the differ-
ence between that week and dif-
ferent weeks," Washington said.
"It was a different feeling. You
got hit a lot differently being on
the scout team."
Last year, Notre Dame rode its
dominant defense to the nation-
al championship game. Pres-
sure from the front seven stifled
Denard Robinson and heldhimin
check earlier in the season. Mich-
igan threw five interceptions in
the loss in South Bend. Borges
said Tuesday that the pressure
caused the mistakes.
Both Borges and Notre Dame
coach Brian Kelly mentioned
on Tuesday that Michigan has
a much different offense than
in past years. The new offense
emphasizes the downhill run-
ning game. But Kelly has con-
structed his defense to defend
that.
"Well, we're built that way,"
Kelly said at his press conference
Tuesday. "We're a bigger, physi-
cal football team. We prefer that
kind of match up."
Kelly said Tuitt could play
"quite a bit" against Michigan's
own All-American, fifth-year
senior left tackle Taylor Lewan.
But he'll also play on the other
side of the line. Kelly added that
Temple had triple-teamed Nix at
times last week.
That's what happens' when
you're 342 pounds. More fright-
ening, Nix has played more con-
sistently than last year, when
Notre Dame gave him frequent
breathers. Even so, Manti Te'o,
who finished second in the Heis-
man voting last year, said he
would have voted for Nix, accord-
ing to the New York Times.
Washington weighs 41 pounds
less than Nix, but he can relate.
He came to Michigan at 330
pounds. The size works for Nix,
but it's not for everyone.
"I'll never get back to it,"
Washington said. "It was hor-
rible."

Japan to spend $470M to
plug up leaking reactor

Project may better
Japan's stake for
2020 Olympic bid
TOKYO (AP) - The Japa-
nese government announced
Tuesday that it will spend
$470 million on a subterra-
nean ice wall and other steps
in a desperate bid to stop leaks
of radioactive water from the
crippled Fukushima nuclear
plant after repeated failures
by the plant's operator.
The decision is widely seen
as an attempt to show that
the nuclear accident won't
be a safety concern just days
before the International
Olympic Committee chooses
among Tokyo, Istanbul and
Madrid as the host of the
2020 Olympics.
The Fukushima Dai-ichi
plant has been leaking hun-
dreds of tons of contaminated
underground water into the
sea since shortly after a mas-
sive 2011 earthquake and tsu-
nami damaged the complex.
Several leaks from tanks stor-
ing radioactive water in recent
weeks have heightened the
sense of crisis that the plant's
owner, Tokyo Electric Power
Co., isn't able to contain the
problem.

"Insteadofleavingthisup to
TEPCO, the government will
step forward and take charge,"
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
said after adopting the out-
line. "The world is watching
if we can properly handle the
contaminated water but also
the entire decommissioning of
the plant."
The government plans to
spend an estimated 47 billion
yen ($470 million) through
the end of March 2015 on two
projects - 32 billion yen ($320
million) on the ice wall and
15 billion yen ($150 million)
on an upgraded water treat-
ment unit that is supposed to
remove all radioactive ele-
ments except water-soluble.
tritium - according to ener-
gy agency official Tatsuya
Shinkawa.
The government, howev-
er, is not paying for urgently
needed water tanks and other
equipment that TEPCO is
usingto contain leaks. Shinka-
wa said the funding is limited
to "technologically challeng-
ing projects" but the govern-
ment is open to additional help
when needed.
The ice wall would freeze
the ground to a depth of up to
30 meters (100 feet) through
a system of pipes carrying
a coolant as cold as minus

40 degrees Celsius (minus
40 Fahrenheit). That would
block contaminated water
from escaping from the facil-
ity's immediate surroundings,
as well as keep underground
water from entering the reac-
tor and turbine buildings,
where much of the radioactive
water has collected.
The project, which TEPCO
and the government proposed
in May, is being tested for fea-
sibility by Japanese construc-
tion giant Kajima Corp. and is
set for completion by March
2015.
Similar methods have been
used to block water from parts
of tunnels and subways, but
building a 1.4-kilometer (0.9-
mile) wall that surrounds four
reactor buildings and their
related facilities is unprec-
edented.
An underground ice wall
has been used to isolate
radioactive waste at the U.S.
Department of Energy's for-
mer site of the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory in Ten-
nessee that produced pluto-
nium, but only for six years,
according to the MIT Tech-
nology Review magazine.
Some experts are still skep-
tical about the technology and
say the running costs would be a
huge burden.

Remark by Boston
mayor sparks anger
from Detroit gov't'

Detroit Mayor
Bing says Menino's
remarks were
'regrettable'
DETROIT (AP) - Detroit
Mayor Dave Bing accused his
Boston counterpart of insen-
sitivity Tuesday after Thomas
Menino told a magazine that if
he ever visited the Motor City,
he'd "blow up the place and start
all over."
In a New York Times Maga-
zine article that first appeared
online last week, Menino said
Detroit is a place he'd like to
visit, then added the rest when
asked what he'd do there.
"It is extremely regrettable
that Boston Mayor Thomas
Menino used such an unfortu-
nate choice of words to describe
what he would do if he came to
Detroit," said Bing, who is not
running for re-election after one
term as mayor. "I would think-
the mayor of a city that recently
experienced a deadly bombing

attack would be more sensitive
and not use the phrase 'blow
up.
A spokeswoman for the Bos-
ton mayor said Menino "feels
strongly about cities," cares
about Detroit's problems and
"would like to help in any way
he can."
"The mayor is sorry that
people have taken offense," Dot
Joyce told The Associated Press
in a phone interview. "It was
never his intention."
She said that Menino's pro-
posal to "blow up the place"
meant to overhaul the broken
systems that have helped bring
down Detroit.
Three people were killed and
more than 260 injured in April
when pressure cookers packed
with explosives, nails, ball bear-
ings and metal shards detonated
near the finish line of the popu-
lar Boston Marathon.
One of the suspects was killed
three days later in a gun battle
with police. His brother was
captured and has pleaded not
guilty to using a weapon of mass
destruction charges.

FROM THE DALY
Common Core, common sense
It's time to focus on educating students and end ideological debates
orty-four states have adopted the Common Core State Stan-
dards, a set of federal benchmarks that spell out math, read-
ing and writing skills for students in kindergarten through
twelfth grade. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Michigan is not one of these
states. Despite the fact that these standards would ensure that Michi-
gan students are on the same level as students across the nation, state
lawmakers are clearly comfortable wasting their constituents' time
with arbitrary and strictly ideological debates about the idea of man-
dated standards. A clear majority of states are currently working on
developing curricula, educating teachers on how to help students
meet these benchmarks and utilizing technology for the classroom.
It's about time Michigan does the same for its students.

J this school year is like any
other, many of you new stu-
dents are arriving at the Uni-
versity with a
long-distance
boyfriend or
girlfriend at
another col-
lege or back
home. A couple
of weeks ago,
you left each
other for EMILY
what might PITTINOS
be the first
time. Now, as
you navigate the cereal dispens-
ers in the Hill Dining Center, you
imagine them longing for you in
the midst of golden wheat fields or
on smoky fire escapes. As you lay
awake in your dorm room with a
stranger's snoring filling the dense
Ann Arbor night, you read and
reread their text messages.
"I love you so much," they say.
"This is the worst, but we'll get
through it."
Of course, it's good to know that
someone cares for you, especially
when your surroundings are so
frighteningly new. You don't know
where to find Angell Hall Audi-
torium A or if you'll have to play
another icebreaker tonight, but
you're sure that there's a person
missing you from miles away. Your
sweetheart - excuse the gender-
neutral '50s slang - is a security
blanket, a perceived constant, a
reminder of the comforts of home.
But, there's such a thing as being
too comfortable.
I know from experience that it's
easy to use a long-distance rela-
tionship as a crutch. It can become
an excuse to stay in and video
chat on a Friday night while kids
from your hall are exploring the
mysterious streets of Ann Arbor.
They're being brave and making
new friends, while you perform
Skype sex in your dim dorm room
- hoping to God you don't hear the

sound of your roommate keying in
the code to your door. They're get-
ting tipsy, maybe even laid, while
you've got your pixelated genitals
traveling all the way to a space sat-
ellite so your partner can get off on
a wavering image of you.
Sure, there's something tragi-
cally romantic about having a lover
so far from your fingertips, and
physical loneliness may not seem
so bad in the face of all your damn
love. But in reality, sexting gets old
real fast and relying on weekend
visits with your roommate in the
bunk below you is goingto make
the long, cold Michigan winter feel
even longer.
I know itcan be especially hard
to imagine yourself with a new
person if your sweetheart was the
first girl to slide her hand down the
waistband of your underwear, or the
first guy to treat your nakedness as
a gift. However, Ican promise you
that there are many others out there
who would gladly do the same. It's
also not just about sex. Imagine what
you could be missing out on while
you slip away from your friends to
update your sweetheartonwhat you
ate for breakfast or what your pro-
fessor was wearinginlecture.
' The classes, choicesand experi-
ences you have now will change
you immeasurably in the long run.
College is a microcosm of endless
possibility and due to its magic, it's
unlikely you'll be the same person
once you graduate. You could take
geology classes that inspire you to
spend the rest of your life on archeo-
logical digs. One wacky Residential
College puppet-making class could
convince you to join the School of
Art & Design. Most importantly, no
matter how greatvYou 2.0 willbe,
you won't be the same person your
sweetheart signed up for, and that
could be true for them as well.
"This is hard!" your lover's texts
say. So, ask yourself: Why are you
doing it? Do you imagine a life
with them after college, a wedding

attended by your entire family and
your genes converging into babies?
If so, then do what you have to do;
in that special case, you'll have the
rest of your lives to be together after
school. If you're unsure, have an
adult discussion about the future
with your partner. If you're mak-
ing the commitment to stay faithful
from a distance, then you should be
able to discuss whatyour relation-
ship may look like in the longterm.
If there's no endgame,
then why commit
yourself to years of
shared lonliness?
But, if there's no endgame in
mind, if there's no plan, then why are
you committing yourself to years of
shared loneliness? Is it true love pro-
pelling your long-distance relation-
ship or fear of the unknown?
New social and sexual experi-
ences are worth the uncertainties
that come along with being on your
own in an unfamiliar place. At this
very mome'nt, there are thousands
of other new students wandering
starry-eyed through campus. Their
collective excitement is building an
energy that sparks new friendships
and bravery, but it will dissipate
once classes fall into full swing.
This is the sweet spot - now's
the time to take advantage of the
fact that everyone is jittery and
unsure and open to new experi-
ences. Be nervous with them. Get
out there and use your fear. You
could be anyone, and do almost
anything. This is the time to move
on from your old life and join in on
the excitement of firsts sweeping
through campus.

The Michigan State Board of Education
adopted Common Core standards in 2010, and
schools subsequently adopted these standards
into their curriculum. However, in July, the
state legislature blocked funding that would
help to implement the standards. One of the
main reasons Common Core is still not univer-
sally welcome is general misinformation. The
Common Core establishes what students need
to know by the end of the year to make them
college- and career-ready. However, they do
not dictate how teachers must instruct stu-
dents, nor do they determine which schools get
funding based on standardized test scores. An
Education Next poll shows that, in general, the
more people know about the new standards,
the more they like them.
Despite the benefits of the initiative, conser-
vative-led opposition has prevented Common
Core from becoming state law. State Rep. Tom
McMillian (R-Rochester Hills) has spearhead-
ed the campaign against the standards, spend-
ing hours badgering the subcommittee with
irrelevant questions. At the crux of his dissent
is the Tea Party notion that the Common Core
is a gross exercise of federal power, undermin-
ingthe state's ability to develop education.
Regardless of political ideology, this under-
standing of the standards is off base. While the
federal government offered grant money to
states that adopted the standards, the Common
Core campaign was lead in part by the National
Governors Associatiod - in other words, it's a

state-led effort. Common Core is not a part of
No Child Left Behind, nor does it "track every-
thing about our nation's children and report it
back to the federal government," as U.S. Sen.
Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) suggested. And while
some adversaries of the initiative dubbed it
"ObamaCore," the standards were being draft-
ed before the presidenttook office.
Common Core is not a nationalized curric-
ulum but a set of educational goals - a list of
math and English skills students should have
regardless of where they are from. The stan-
dards have been developed by teachers and
education experts with significant experience
and understanding of where American stu-
dents should be heading. Adoption of the stan-
dards is voluntary - it's not being forced down
anyone's throat by the federal government.
Gov. Rick Snyder understands this and sup-
ports the initiative. So does former Republican
Gov. John Engler.
WhileMcMillian and other opponents' dis
sent. may make them heroes of the right-wing
fringe just in time for election season, it's not
doing any favors for Michigan's students who
continue to fall behind. Michigan ranks near
the bottom in most subject areas compared to
other states. These standards will help Michi-
gan to not only compete on a nationwide level,
but on an international one as well.Michigan's
lawmakers need to set the ideologically driven
paranoia aside and focus on what we really
need - better education.

LAYAN CHARARA
One size d(
Weeks after the Egyptianmilitaryoverthrew
democratically elected President Mohamed
Morsi from power, an Egyptian court ordered
the release of former President Hosni Mubarak
from prison after failingto chargehim with any
crimes - one of many testaments to the rever-
sal of the democracy-seeking Arab Spring.
These events, in tandem with the military's
new self-imposed rule, have left the country
in a state of "Mubarakism without Mubarak,"
and, asa result, prompted many to jump to the
conclusion that Islam and democracy are irrec-
oncilable - if they weren't already convinced
so. Egypt dabbled in democracy for a short
period, but its failure reaffirmed the precon-
ceived notion that Muslims are incapable of
maintaining a democratic government due to
their inability to suppress their violent tenden-
cies, respect people of different faiths and grant'
basic rights by virtue of their holy book.
From the onset of the uprisings in the Arab
World, the West has offered its recommenda-
tions for achieving democracy in the region -
imperialistically, I might add. What is unclear
to many is that political beliefs are relative
to individuals within a specific identity, and
prescribing Western democracy is not a viable
solutionto the hot political climate of the Mid-,
dle East, for cultures will clash with systems
that aren't mindful of their intricate dynamic.
It's not the Middle East that is unsuitable for
democracy, but rather Western democracy is
unsuitable for the Middle East.
Indispensable in the discussion of Ameri-
can and European endeavors in the Middle
East is the distinction between Western
democracy and -the shape of democracy
appropriate for the Middle East. The West-
ern prescription for democracy in the Middle
East includes a substantial dosage of secular-
ism, but neglects the most vital ingredient for
democracy - pluralism. Egypt's experiment
with democracy failed for many reasons, but
most importantly because it attempted to uti-
lize an imposed model of government that
doesn't take into consideration the religio-
cultural fabric of the country. In failing to
recognize Islam and democracy's inherent
commitments to pluralism, Egypt's Muslim.,
Brotherhood illegitimated itself and razed
any hope for sound human rights policy in

)esll't fit all
the country.
For decades, Egypt's people withstood
censorship in every sense under Mubarak's
despotic regime. Since being released from
his stronghold, the Muslim Brotherhood has
reacted erroneously to the public's concerns.
Consequently, critics around the world were
quick to jump the gun and herald Egypt as
the paradigm of what democracy looks like
among Arabs and Muslims. Never mind that
Morsi and his cronies thrived on sectarianism
and followed their own deluded interpreta-
tion of Islam. And never mind that this placed
the Muslim Brotherhood at odds with the
legitimate democratic process that brought
the party to power and Shariah law, which it
claims to have been trying to implement.
What is most important to note when
discussing the Shariah is that men created
this body of laws. The Qur'an is the primary
source used to construct said laws, but it's by
no means a book of laws. This supplements
the suggestion that Islam doesn't intrinsically
encourage any form of government. Seeing as
the Shariah is man-made, it's predisposed to
change just as man's opinions are with time,
thus not ruling out the prospect of democracy.
Contrary to popular belief, it's not blasphe-
mous for Muslims to live under the rule of a
government by the people and for the people.
In a region such as the Middle East, how-
ever, where a person's religion defines his or
her identity, it's difficult to isolate faith and
politics. So, the most practical solution is to
implement a fusion of the Shariah and democ-
racy - in Muslim-majority countries, that is.
Moreover, a culturally relativistic approach
when offering advice as an outsider is impera-
tive. The United States is without a doubt the
most important actor in the global political
arena, but what our government fails to rec-
ognize at times is thatthis isn't a one-size-fits-
all world, and what is suitable for our secular
society may not be so in the Middle East. We
must not impose our visions for the region
in such a way that will thwart any progress
towards governments that will honor the
rights of their people and promote diplomatic
relations with the rest of the world.
Layan Charara i, an LSA junior.

Across artylines, politi-
cians in recent elections
have agreed on one thing:
We have an
"energy issue."
What precisely
that issue is has
been more dif-
ficult to define,
but whether
the motivation
arises from geo-'JUA '
politics, environ- ZAEINA
mental concerns
or technologi-
cal forecasts, the widely accepted
consensus is that we, as a nation,
simply cannot stay the course when
it comes to fuel.
Last November, Michigan voters
struck down a ballot proposal that
would have mandated that 25 per-
cent of the state's energy usage be
supplied from renewable sources.
Scientifically, it was a feasible goal,
although the outcome of the vote
shed light on a more complex reality.
The roadblock to reaching a solution
to our "energy problem" isn't tech-
nological, but political. If Michigan
is serious about being a leader in
addressing the energy concerns, we
must be serious about supporting
alternative fuels. The most economi-
rally, technologically and geopoliti-
cally sustainable way to do this is tq
advocate for the continued growth
of nuclear energy throughout Mich-
igan and the rest of the country.
Opposition to alternative ener-
gy often comes from an economic
standpoint. Fossil fuels provide
more energy output per unit than
many other types of fuel and are eas-
ily deliverable to consumers given
current infrastructure.
For many Americans, the price at
the pump is-the measure for wheth-
er or not we have an "energy prob-
lem" worthy of political action. We
expect our fuel to be cheap, con-
sistent and available. If the costs
are too high, there's an issue..But,

currently, we don't have another
choice besides literally buying into
the problem.
The technology required to
achieve, indepen ent, sustainable.
energy already e ists. If the United
States undertook a massive over-
haul of our current electrical grid
and replaced all power stations
with breeder nuclear reactors, we'd
be able to meet ogr energy needs at
Jhe current consumption rate for up
to five billion years. France already,
gets almost 80 percent of its electric
power from nuclear sources com-
pared with Michigan's 22 percent
and the United States' 19 percent.
So why don't we "go nuclear?"
Simply put, the technological switch
to more sustainable fuel sources is
being held back by a society that has
adapted to fossil fuels. Even if the
infrastructure of our current power
grid were taken out of the equation,
many examples of societal rejection
of energy alternatives would still
exist. From the long-established
coal mining communities of the
eastern United States to the power-
ful anti-nuclear obbies, the energy
issue isn't play d out in research
labs, but in polit' al campaigns.
Fear is also '2 strong motivator
against change Although there
are legitimate concerns about what
the United States would do with
its nuclear waste, the issues raised
about the safety of nuclear power
are largely misconstrued. Nuclear
power is statistically the safest
form of energy currently available.
When assessed by the number of
deaths per terawatt hour of energy
produced from each commercially
viable power source, nuclear ener-
gy is at the very bottom of the list.
Coal and oil combined are respon-
sible for almost 5,000 percent more
deaths than nuclear power. More
people have had fatal accidents
falling, off their roofs installing
solar panels than have ever died by
nuclear incidents.

Despite these statistics, the fact
that nuclear power was first intro-
duced to the world as the atomic
bomb - a devastating source of
destruction - continues to have
lasting effects. Following the Fuku=
shima Daiichi disaster of 2011,
public support for nuclear power
dropped to 43 percent, though pub-
lic support for hydroelectric power
has remained fairly consistent over
the years, even in the wake of the
dam failure in China that killed ail
estimated 171,000 people. If we're
to fairly address energy issues, we.
must present the facts accurately
and encourage a culture in popular
media and schools that leans away
from an anti-nuclear bias.
The roadblock to
reaching a solution to our
"energy problem" isn't
technological but political.
Michigan's rejected ballot pro-
posal represents a crossroads that
the United States must contemplate.
Have we reached the point in our
society where we perceive the limi-
tations of our fossil-fuel-dependent
infrastructure to finally overshad-
ow the costs that overhauling the
system would incur? or do we still
perceive our economic and societal
situation as one where the oppor-
tunity cost of devoting significant
effort and resources to this kind of
overhaul would be too great? At this
point, the limiting factor in prevent-
ing a solution to our "energy prob-
lem" isn't technological, but rather
political and ultimately, societal
- a problem that we can and must
change through education, policy
and politics.

A playlist of advice
for freshmen

Lyrics to hit songs
can tell you how to
live life at the 'U'
ByJENDALL RUSS
OnlineArts Editor
You've arrived at Michigan.
You've enjoyed your first win
at the Big House, cheering rau-
cously as. you and thousands
of your neon Maize-clad peers
form a cowbell-and-lanyard-
fueled euphoria. You've stub-
bornly worn your freshman
lanyard to every single orienta-
tion event. You've decided to
frame your lanyard for the good
luck it brought you at UMix triv-
ia. You love your lanyard. You
look at your lanyard and think,
Oh, lanyard, can college possibly
get any better than this?
Now, I'm not here to answer
that admittedly difficult ques-
tion. And I am absolutely not
here to patronize you. I wore
my lanyard once, too. I'm merely
here to offer you some totally
unwarranted, probably unde-
sired and yet, perhaps, mar-
ginally helpful guidance on
approaching your college expe-
rience.
Since I usually write about
music, and since I lack author-
ity to speak on the matter on
any grounds other than the I've-
been-here-F O R E V E R-so-let-
me-tell-you-how-to-do-it angle,
I thought I'd invoke a muse, or
four, and try to spell out some
lessons I've learned - or wish I
had learned sooner - during my
three-plus years at Michigan.
Make of them what you will.
Animal Collective -
"College"
Relevant lyric: "You don't have
to go to college."

The question appears in
many forms, usually first in high
school. "Where are you going to
school?" Eventually, once you've
settled: "What school do you
go to?" When you near the fin-
ish line, it alters slightly: "What
kind of job are you looking
for?" The fundamental prem-
ise underlying these questions,
though, suggests there is a path
we must follow, a structure we
must fit in to, a game we have to
play. Today, the question is not,
"Do you want to go to college?"
It's "What college are you going
to?" There's an implied sense of
obligation, of having no viable
alternative.
I was asked the other day if I
went to school. It was refreshing
to hear, not least of all because
I'm tired of all the questions
about what my post-graduation
plans are. It was asked without
pretext, and it reminded me of
that Animal Collective lyric. You
don't have to go to college to be
successful, find your passion or
eat a lot of pizza (though it might
help for that last one).
Sometimes it feels like college
is somethingwe have to do. When
it does, it becomes alot less enjoy-
able. Don't go to college because
you think you have to. You don't.
Go to college because it offers you
the best resources for learning -
about yourself, about growing up,
about the world.
Robyn - "Call Your Girlfriend"
Relevant lyric: "Call your girl-
friend/It's time you had the talk/
Give your reasons/Say it's not her
fault / But you just met somebody
new"
'Your brother is telling you to.
Your parents are telling you to.
Your friends are telling you to.
Even you're kinda telling you to.
And now I'm telling you to. Trust
me onthis one.

The National - "Slow Show"
Relevant lyric: "You know I've
dreamed aboutyou/For29 years/
BeforeIsawyou"
Don't wait 29 years like Matt
Berninger - go out and meet
people! Introduce yourself to that
cute boy or girl you always sit
next to in Statistics. Maybe you'll
get married on the spot. Join that
club you're interested in but over-
whelmed by. Be overwhelmed.
It's normal. Michigan is a huge
school. Make it smaller.
All orientation speak aside,
don't refuse a potentially great
thing by defeating yourself. If
someone's a jerk to you, they
aren't worth it anyway. Don't let a
jerk dictate your life. Nobodylikes
jerks anyway.
Pink Floyd - "Shine On You
Crazy Diamond"
Relevant lyric: "Shine on you
crazy diamond / Come on you
raver, you seer ofvisions/ Come on
youpainter,youpiperyouprisoner,
andshine!"
A lot of things are going to
happen to you in college. Some
of them will be really good, and
some will be truly awful. You're
going to make a lot of mistakes.
People (like me) will try to tell
you how to avoid making those
mistakes, but at the end of the day,
you're on the hook. Don't worry so
much about doingit right or doing
it wrong that you wind up doing
nothing at all. You'll end up learn-
ing a lot more about yourself if you
don't let other people's experienc-
es direct your own.
Do your thing. Don't take
yourself too seriously. Enjoy your
time at Michigan and shine on
like only a crazy diamond could.
Because you know what they
say: #YOLO - You Only Lanyard

Daily Sports Writer
Following a season that brought
an unranked team to its first Final
Four appearance in program his-
tory, the Michigan volleyball team
enters the 2013 season ranked sev-
enth in the AVCA preseason poll.
At No. 7, the Wolverines claimed
their highest preseason position
in 40 years and fall just behind
conference foes No. 6 Minnesota'
and No. 2 Penn State.
Michigan sits among seven
other Big Ten teams represented
in the top-25, including No. 10
Nebraska, No. 14 Michigan State,
No. 16 Purdue and No. 20 Ohio
State. The Wolverines are sched-
uled to play three other regu-
lar season opponents - Illinois,
TexasA&M and Wisconsin - who
each narrowly missed a top-25
nod.
For a team whose late-season
success was attributed to chem-
istry both on and off the court,
this season presents a whole new
challenge. Michigan coach Mark
Rosen acknowledges that, with a
target on their backs, the Wolver-
ines will have to be solid at every
position.
"Everyone is coming after us,"
Rosen said. "I think in some ways,
it won't be that much different.
When it comes to Michigan and
the block 'M', most teams we play
in and out of conference, we get
their best shot. I' d rather wear a
big target and be good than hide
around in the background and
just be average. We proudly wear
that target, but we have to under-
stand that we can't take any nights
off. The name doesn't get us any
points, it's how we play."
Michigan returns 13 letter-
winners and five starters. Only
fifth-year senior middle blocker
Claire McElheny has graduated.
Previously a young team, the 2013
roster boasts five seniors and one
junior. The Wolverines swept
their first challengers since a sum-
mer tour in South America at the
Xavier Invitational.
After three weeks in the gym,
here is a look at the Michigan vol-
leyball team by position:
Outside hitters
Senior co-captain Lexi Erwin
proved herself among the nation's
elite hitters with her record-
setting junior season. In 2012,

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Sophomore libero Tiffany Morales returns as a leader of Michigan's back line.
Erwin set a school record for most man middle blocker Abbey Cole

kills (614) and hitting attempts
(1,701) in a single season. She led
the team with 17 double-doubles
and recorded double-digit kills in
34 of 38 games last season. Her
postseason performance earned
her a spot on the Division-I Vol-
leyball Championships all-tour-
nament team, Berkeley Regional
Most Valuable Player and AVCA
All-America honorable mention.
Erwin enters her senior year as
one of three Wolverines selected
to the All-Big Ten team.
Senior outside hitter Molly
Toon represents the second in
the hitting one-two punch. In
her junior season, Toon started
28 games and finished with 528
kills. Known for her live arm and
explosive streaks - she bested her
career high with 25 kills against
then-No.4 Nebraska - Toon will
need to improve upon her consis-
tency in order to compete against
the many skilled blockers in the
conference.
Middle blockers
With the addition of three tall
freshmen, the roster now boasts
11 players over 6-foot, a potential
X-factor against conference oppo-
nents like Penn State, Nebraska
and Minnesota. At 6-foot-4, fresh-

represents the Wolverines' tallest
member, and will likely start in
September.
Though Michigan will need
to fill the loss of McElheny at the
net, the fifth-year senior made her
home on the right side for most
of her final year in Ann Arbor. It
is likely that Cole or 6-foot-four
freshman Gabbie Bulic will likely
make the transition to the oppo-
site position, giving the Wolver-
ines a towering front line.
Michigan returns two middle
blockers in senior co-captain
starter in Jennifer Cross and
sophomore Krystalyn Goode. The
pair led the team in blocks, with
Goode's 112 blocks falling second
to Cross's 181. Cross was named
to the preseason All-Big Ten team
following a year that included
379 kills and a spot on the AVCA
All-America third team. Having
recorded 908 career kills, Cross
will likely join the 1,000-kill club
by the midway point this season.
Setter
Entering her third year as the
Wolverines' starting setter, Lexi
Dannemiller rounds out the All-
Big Ten preseason selections.
In 2012, Dannemiller started all
38 matches at setter en route to

1,622 assists - good for third in
the U-M record book and with
as many as 59 in a single match.
Dannemiller aided in over 11 kills
per game for the Michigan and
recorded 15 double-doubles on
the season. As the sergeant on the
court, Dannemiller is responsible
for directing both the defense and
the offense on nearly every play.
The Wolverines add a second
setter in 6-foot Cindy Zhou, a top-
50 recruit out of Libertyville, Ill.
With her height, Zhou will likely
earn time on the right side, in
order to run what is called a six-
two system to give Dannemiller
an opportunity to swing from the
opposite position.
Defense
A Final Four run forced a
young Michigan defense to earn
its stripes against some of the
league's toughest arms - and they
did just that. Despite early-season
jitters, libero Tiffany Morales fin-
ished her freshman year as the
leader of the Wolverines' back line
with 559 digs and as a member of
the All-Big Ten freshman team.
Morales was also a threat with
her serving (.928) and sets out of
the backcourt.
Though Rosen did not add any-
thing to the defense, a confident
Morales and an experienced back
line should take care of business
for Michigan. Morales will be
aided by Erwin - who plays her
position all the way through -
and defensive specialists junior
Ally Sabol and freshman Lind-
say Lerg. But if there is one place
where the Wolverines will look to
improve, it is on serve reception.
Michigan committed 132 receiv-
ing errors in 38 games last season.
"We're a good blocking team
and we're constantly getting bet-
ter at blocking," Rosen said. "But
we're also a very good floor defen-
sive team. We're bigger than we've
been in the past so I think we can
be a little more aggressive at the
net but I think we still have great
backcourt defense. Defense is cer-
tainly going to be a big focus for us
as it always is. I like what we have
to work with defensively, but yet I
think we can also be a very, very
physical offensive team. We're big,
we're balanced, we can control
the ball well on serve-receive, so I
see us being a very steady physical
offensive team as well, which is a
great combination."

"How has student
activism changed at

Assistant Prof. Stephen Ward
who teaches courses in urban stud-
ies, community development and
African-American studies and
Communication Studies Prof. Scott
Campbellmetat The MichiganDaily
newsroom to discuss this question.
below are selected excerpts from
their conversation.
Prof. Scott Campbell: One of
the things I've noticed with stu-
dents over the last couple of years
is it seems like they're feeling an
increasing amount of pressure to
be involved in various social causes
and volunteer organizations and
things for the sake of getting that
scholarship, or even getting that
job or that internship, in bolstering
their resume and getting their leg

up. It just seems like they're feeling
a lot more pressure to do that then
they used to.
Prof. Stephen Ward: Almost
like, for lack of a better term, the
professionalization of activism or
really, engagement. That's a word
that's used a lot now and covers a
wide range... Really what do we
mean by student activism? What
counts as activism? What consti-
tutes activism?
So we can sort of talk about what
we've seen there and we can also
talk about student activism, having
been in another time period.
I think a lot of activist energy has
been transformed into what we call
engagement in many ways, so social
service, activities, service learning

activities, so you referenced it in
terms of students feeling the pres-
sure to do these things for their
resume, right? So that's for their
personal, which is very different
from the sense of social responsibil-
ity that we might think of previous
generations like the '60s generation.
SC: Right. When I was offered


my position here ... I had kind of the
preconceived notions of what the
culture is like at the University of
Michigan from kind of a stereotypi-
cal point of view.

SW: Such as, what would that
mean?
SC: Historically, I think of Mich-
igan as avery progressive place with
protests, you know? Vietnam-era
protests, Civil Rights protests. And
I got here, and I felt like the activ-
ism that I saw was highly engaged,
but, to use a word that you dropped,
professionalized in a way. People in
the B-school bolstering resumes...
SW: Right, right.
SC:... and that kind of thing. And
it felt like they were a little bit more
personally ambitious in their goals
than collectively trying to change
the world.
SC: Itdoes feel to me, and again I
wasn't here a generation or two ago,
but it does feel to me that student
activism is happening perhaps a bit
more in concert with institutional
efforts.
SW: Oh absolutely.
SC: ... rather than oppositional.
So I would say that probably at least
seems to be one of the major differ-
ences in terms of the visible forms
of activism.
SW: Absolutely. I mean, we're
here in the Daily offices and around
the room they have past front pages

and a couple of them deal with stu-
dent activism, one of them is a stu-
dent climb up of this very building
protesting how the University was
dealing with Student Publications.
Others are from the '60s dealing
with things off campus as well as
challenging the University. A couple
of them are about affirmative action,
so at the time you and I have been
here, it seems to me two of the main
spaces of student activism which
were more generally active in terms
of challenging the University and
things across society were affir-
mative action about a decade ago,
and more recently tuition equal-
ity, which is going to be in the news
today.
SC: Right.
SW: So I see those as students
engaging with issues that are relat-
ed to them here on campus - hap-
pening here on campus but having
broader social implications. So the
protests are prodding at the Uni-
versity to do something for affir-
mative action same as the policy
which now has been changed with
tuition equality for students who
are so-called undocumented ... So,
tuition equality, my understanding,
is that all the students, many of the
students, who are involved in that
struggle are not themselves stu-
dents who would benefit, and they
see that as an issue. In the affirma-
tive action case it was less so, but,
still, many white students were
involved in affirmative action, so
that's not a particularly important
point, but that's what I think about
how activism takes place.

Do you have a girlfriend?
by Andrew Weiner

we want you ann arbor affairs: a thing by carlinaduan

Welcome back to The Statement. This semester, we have
one major goal: to put you in the magazine. You'll notice the
new "Statement on the Street" section, which takes us out
of our newsroom cave at 420 Maynard and to the streets to
hear your voice. And we want to hear back from you. Share
your opinion on our content, and let us know what gets you
thinking on campus. You can even write a Personal State-
ment to share your own experiences with our readers. So
you - person excited to hold the first issue of the semester
- comment, tweet, e-mail or snail mail us what you want
to read and say. This is your chance to make a statement, so
speak up - we're listening.
The Statement Staff

I bumped into him on my way
back from a club meeting. The
October moon glazed over the
street. I barely made out his face
in the dark.
Tentatively, I called out his
name.
He paused, then walked closer.
Behind us, a streetlamp beat out
its own steady light. His eyebrows
kicked upwards in recognition.
"Carlina! How've you been?" We
chatted briefly. No, he wasn't
in school this semester. He was
working at a restaurant in town.
He'd be traveling abroad in the
winter.
The talk ended after we'd
exchanged numbers, and I hus-
tled back to South Quad to gush
to my roommate over how cute
he was.
A few weeks later, he texted
me: "Sooo... we should hang
out."
And so, I found myself in
Kerrytown in early November,
drinking hot chocolate with a
cute boy and blabbing earnest-
ly. More of a friend-date than
anything, I convinced myself.
Until he texted me later that
night: "you're awesome Car-
lina. Like really. we should chill
again soon." My heart winked
for a tiny second. I analyzed the
text over dinner with my friend
Andrew. "He's definitely inter-
ested," Andrew declared, stirring
a watery bowl of lentil soup. Still,
I wasn't sure.
I hung out with him a few more
times that month before I real-
ized how much I was beginning
to like him. It seemed that I had
finally found a guy who got it.
How to listen and absorb, how
to be fascinated by the world,
how to be sexy and modest at the
same time. When I went home
one weekend, I told my sister he

had potential to be The One. "I've
never felt like this before with
anybody," I exclaimed. "I just like
him so much."
He kissed me over Thanks-
giving break. A small kiss. He
had to duck down, tap his mouth
to mine, standing beneath the
streetlamp by his car. I adored
him: his cheeks, the Angela Davis
books scattered in rectangular
piles all over his room, the blonde
splash of hair nestled in the cen-
ter of his head. I thought I was on
my way to being in love.
And then, it stopped. He

unleashing my inner-emo while
staring at a blank ceiling and lis-
tening to Bon Iver. I wanted him
to be The One. Or if not THE One,
thenA One. I loved his hands, and
his eyebrows and the stupid dog
hairs on his shirt. I loved how he
surprised me, constantly, with his
brain.
For six months, we exchanged
the occasional Facebook mes-
sage or email. His messages were
always simple, short. Nice. When
I left for my spring semester in
New Hampshire, he told me to
expect a letter. I spent six weeks
in New Hampshire painfully
checking the mail every day,
awaiting an international post-
age-marked envelope that never
came.
If one flavor of love is yearning,
then I suppose I did love him. For
half a year, I wanted him to think
of me as the girl he might want to
love back, time given. But I also
wanted, desperately, for us to
keep on having our cool and calm
conversations in comfort with-
out the wrenching anxiety that
came with waiting for his replies
back, his affirmation. My two
wants seemed incompatible with
each other. "Love" versus Friend.
"Thing" versus Friendship.
When he finally came home
over the summer, we split a sand-
wich at Jimmy Johns and read
astronomy books at Dawn Tread-
er. Neither of us mentioned our
"thing." But he told me I was an
important friend. "I've learned a
lot from you," he said, "I'm grate-
ful." I never told him how much,
exactly, I thought I'd been in love
with him. In a way, it didn't mat-
ter anymore. I still loved him, but
it was a love that wasn't curried
with demand. He gave me a letter
he meant to send me a month ago.
It was signed, "Your friend."

stopped calling me as frequently.
Wouldn't reply to my texts for
days. Acted uncomfortable and
distant when we hung out. The
confession came past midnight,
both of us nested on a curb by
East Quad. "I'm about to leave in
less than a month, and we got into
this so fast... too fast, almost," he
blurted, "I just don't think this is
feasible, given the time that we
have."
When he finally left, I cried. I
cried at the Diag, running into
a friend who fetched me toilet
paper from the men's room at
Mason Hall. Cried in my room,

The bus is packed, but we're the only
people talking. Maize and blue
freshmen stare at us with wide eyes.
I'm red, visibly sweating and incoherently
mumbling the words I so badly don't want
to say.
Rewind 20 minutes.
Surface-level, Taylor Lewan is intimidat-
ing. "I'm just there to be big and hit guys,"
the football team star lineman has told me
before abouthis football skills. At 315 pounds
he's a hummer H2 of a guy, and standing
anywhere near him is dwarfing - and I'm
6-feet-3-inches tall.
The Michigan Man incarnate and I walk
to catch a bus from North Campus to Cen-
tral. "So, umm, you play ... football?" It's
a stupid question that I already know the
answer to, but as friends and failed dates
will confirm, one-on-one situations with
men I don't know well are not my strong suit.
Taylor Lewan doubles the usual anxiety.
While I avoid eye contact, Taylor is
friendly and normal as he casually describes
turning down his first-round NFL Draft
pick - read: fame and fortune - to finish
up with Blue. College is pretty fun, it turns
out, and he isn't done with Ann Arbor just
yet. As we walk down Bonisteel, the fresh-
men stare, incredulous that he exists outside
of the Big House. Taylor waves at one or two
with a friendly laugh, much to their embar-
rassment.
Like them, I have forgotten how to act
like a person in his presence. Taylor tries to
spark conversation, but I can't seem to rattle
off more than a few words at no more than a
whisper to any of his attempts. He told me
weeks later he couldn't figure out why I dis-
liked him so nugh qtsfiys,t."NoysisqrpIIwas
just straight up terrified of you." Note: Tay-

for had a pet teacup pig, fedora and moped
scooter. Terrifying stuff.
Finally, we board the bus. It's the day of
the last.game of the Final Four. The cam-
pus has been electrified for the last couple
weeks by the success of the men's basket-
ball team, which has made it to the national
championship for the first time in 20 years.
In lieu of shuttle buses to Atlanta, the Ath-
letic Department is showing the game on big
screens at the Crisler Center. Slack-jawed
and silent, the kids heading to Crisler stare
at Taylor and me - read: Taylor - as we talk.
I start to act like a human being again. He
speaks at a normal volume on the quiet bus.
I'm not sure if he notices that all conversa-
tion has stopped to eavesdrop on his, or if it's
such a commonplace occurrence that he's
learned to feign ignorance.
The bus curves down Fuller. The con-
versation takes the turn I was hoping it
wouldn't. Taylor tells me about how his
girlfriend - Alex, who's very sweet and co-
owner of the teacup pig - is the sister of his
teammate Drew Dileo and of the occasional
awkwardness of that arrangement. At this
point, the freshmen's eyes are heat lamps in
my direction. I begin to panic sensing the
question I can see coming as clearly as the
cars headed toward us one lane over.
"Do you have a girlfriend?"
I lift my sleeve to my forehead to wipe
away sweat as I stammer sounds too inco-
herent to qualify even as syllables. Somehow
the words fall from my mouth at a nearly
inaudible volume.
My anxiety level is better fit for a life-
threatening situation.
Without a beat of pause: "Oh my god, I'm
so,sorryJ uged,gy as,anadjective before, I
totally shouldn't -" I wave my hands for him

to stop, it's cool, it's cool. I'm not offended,
and, hey, let's talk quieter! The adjective use
before we got on the bus had barely regis-
tered with me, but he hadn't forgotten. His
reaction tackles me, I nearly fall over as the
bus stops at an intersection and deservedly
feel like an asshole for making assumptions
about someone I barely knew at that point
based on a few keywords: big, football,
Southern.
"You know,
I've never
met a gay per-
son before, I M
think." I skip
the pedantic
rant about how
that's statisti-
cally impos-
sible. Instead
we talk - he's
legitimately
interested. Is
it hard to meet
guys? Do my 9
parents know?
As my pro- -7
fuse sweating
subsides and
I really hope I 8
put on deodor-
ant that morn- 9 3
ing, I answer.
I answer as 5
easily as if he
had asked me
if I'm Cana- 8 6
dian - I'm not,
thank God -
or aboutbeing
Jewish. Smil-

ing since his initial reaction, I can't help but
laugh at the absurdity of the setting, actors
and dialogue of this scene.
"Do you have a girlfriend?"
The question doesn't really scare me axp
more. The bus keeps rolling forward.

"I have concerns about whether this is
appropriate under federal law and believe this
type of national issue should be resolved at the
xderal level," Newman said ina statement.
Opponents of the measure have also
expressed concerns, mainly regarding undoc-
umented families not payingstate taxes.
According to an Institute on Taxation and
Economic Policy report families of undocu-
mented students often pay some state taxes,
such as sales and property tax, contributing
about $126 million in local and state tax rev-
enue in Michigan.
However, the University's initial concerns
focused on changes to residency requirements.
"I think we are in a circumstance now
where we have residency requirements and
we need tobe consistent withoutundermining
the residency standards that we've had in the
past because those have been important for
the University," Coleman said in January. "I'm
hopeful that we can get there, but we'll see."
As a result of these concerns, the Univer-
'ity administration and task force carefully
considered the impacts of potential changes
to residency guidelines.
TUITION'S NITTY-GRITTY
Between June 2012 and February 2013,
the committee explored the ways in which
university, state and federal policies affected
undocumented students.
As part of this process, the task force exam-
ined policy at three especially progressive
universities in the area of tuition equality: the
diversity of Texas-Austin and the University
of California-Berkeley and Los Angeles.
In additionto Texas and California, 16 states
have provisions allowing in-state tuition rates
for undocumented students. Fourteen states
provide these provisions through state legisla-
tion and two states allow in-state tuition rates
for undocumented students through Board of
Regents decisions.
While the report was not intended to make a
finalrecommendation, the task force considered
potentialmethodology to qualifyundocumented
students for in-state tuition. Previously, the Uni-
versity based tuition fees on residency, meaning
students needed to be recognized by the state
as Michigan residents. This policy prevented
undocumented students from taking advantage
of the hefty difference between in- and out-of-
state tuition. Following the example set by the
UC campuses and the UT-Austin, the report
found tuition fees could be based on a student's
high school education rather than residency.
While it seemed the task force had nar-
rowed in on a possible solution, the Universi-
ty's Office of General Counsel, represented on
the committee by Donica Varner, University
sociate General Counsel, raised concerns
regarding potential externalities of revised
guidelines.
"We (the University) get sued on our (pre-
revision) residency policy all the time and we
always win because our residency policy is
airtight," Jolly said. "It's legally rock solid."

General Counsel said the largest demographic

mented students. Instead, students on Ohio's
border who attended a Michigan high school
or boarding students at private schools, such
as Cranbrook, would receive the largest, unin-
tended benefit.
Thus was born the middle-school clause in
the adopted version of the guidelines, which
requires two years attendance at a Michigan
middle school as a condition for receiving in-
state tuition.
EVOLVING VIEWS
While the task force trudged on inside
the Administration Building, CTE continued
their protests down State Street at regents
meetings. Jolly and Lieberman said the prog-
ress of the task force often influenced the tone
and scale of direct actions such as protests and
sit-ins, with organizers carefully considering
the demands of the moment.
December 2012, just before students left

attaching a human face to a not particularly
interesting area of University governance.
Storytelling is the most effective form of
advocacy, and they mastered that."
Provost Martha Pollack, who succeeded
Hanlon last spring, tempered CTE's role in
influencingthe policy.
Contrary to Coleman's January statements
stressingthe firmnature ofresidencyguidelines,
Pollack said the University had already been
consideringrevisions prior to CTE protests.
Pollack emphasized the broader nature of
the new guidelines, created to streamline paths
to in-state tuition, rather than promote larger
policy concerning undocumented students.
"That being said, it's certainly true that as
the students from CTE and the various vet-
erans groups spoke over the year, that they
raised our awareness of this and that got built
into the process, but again the changes in the
policy are much broader," Pollack said.
But Bernstein said CTE protests might

change or civil rights dialogue - CTE was also
a conversation about what student activism
might mean and look like in the 21st century.
"It's the biggest thing that's happened in
Michigan student activism since the '60s,"
Lieberman said. "It's the story of students
coming together, identifying a problem and
thinking about how to change the issues fac-
ing them. I thinka lot of people paint our gen-
eration as apathetic people who don't really
care. This story fundamentally challenges
that narrative."
The movement also placed a spotlight on
the inflexible nature of higher education.
While multiple coalition members have rec-
ognized the success in the movement's turn-
around time -less than two years - some
characterized the University as traditionally
slow to change.
"If the threshold for change required an
entire movement, I don't think that's reason-
able," Mersol-Barg said. "I think the Univer-
sity decisionmakers could not only be doing a
much better job engaging a students who want
to change campus, but proactively seeking
them out and ensuring their vision is realized."
Mersol-Barg is convinced the University
could have issued a decision without waiting
a number of months.
"Ultimately, direct actions like the sit-in
in front of the Union are what pushed the
regents over the edge," Mersol-Barg said. "As
I understand, a number of regents just wanted
to get it taken care of because we were making
too much noise."
Though some administrators have dis-
counted CTE's total influence, they have fre-
quently applauded the movement's displays of
student activism.
"Dialogue on challenging issues is what
we're all about here at Michigan, and I hope it
doesn't go away," Pollack said. "I won't always
agree with the students, but I certainly want
to hear what they have to say."
Still, Mersol-Barg said it's difficult to
pinpoint the extent to which CTE truly
influenced the opinions of regents or admin-
istrators. While Pollack characterized the
administration's views on tuition equality as
evolving, Mersol-Barg said the administration
didn't follow a uniform progression, adding
that some administrators and regents were
more receptive than others.
"On one hand, this is a wonderful success
in that we demonstrated that the regents will
respond to students, especially when it comes
to matters as complicated and controversial as
this one," Mersol-Barg said. "However, I don't
think that this establishes too much precedent
in terms of students who want to change the
University."
But for now, CTE is not going away. LSA
senior Meg Scribner and Morales, current
CTE leaders, said the new focus of the move-
ment will be securing financial aid for undoc-
umented students.
"It's really important not to let this issue
disappear," Scribner said.
Though the impact of the recently inked
policy may remain uncertain, one thing's
clear: Less than two years ago, a couple of stu-
dents had a grievance and an idea.

Ann Arbor for semester break, CTE members
and allies, now numbering in the hundreds,
wore yellow t-shirts and donned red duct
tape over their mouths to represent "silenced"
voices of undocumented students.
The protests and task force meetings con-
tinued simultaneously.
"For maybe six months, through Decem-
ber, it did not seem as if we were going to get
our way," Lieberman said.
As protests continued, the task force was
meeting simultaneously, sometimes the day
before or after an action from CTE.
"It was awkward, but at least (the adminis-
tration) understood we weren't going to put up
a white flag due to the task force," Jolly said.
According to administrators, the protests
did not stifle the working relationship of the
task force.
University Regent Mark Bernstein (D-Ann
Arbor), an early proponent of granting in-state
tuition to undocumented Michigan students,
deemed CTE's protests as thoughtful, digni-
fied and effective-especially in sharing the
stories of affected students.
"It was a blueprint for effective advo-
cacy," Bernstein said. "I was deeply moved
by the stories that these students and their
allies shared. They were very successful in

have guided the direction of the changes to
in-state tuition guidelines.
"The tuition guidelines are a dynamic docu-
ment," Bernstein said."They change every once
and a while to keep pace with-the changing
nature of the University. There are lots of ways
tuition guidelines can change. The advocacy
work by these studentshad a significant impact
on the evolution of our tuition guidelines."
THt HISTORICAL ARC
Though various parties may dispute CTE's
ultimate influence, it's difficult to discredit
the scope of their on-campus presence. In less
than two years, what began as a small group of
students organizing at four a.m. in the UGLi
reached a visible crescendo last April when
eight students were arrested outside the Union
in a display of civil disobedience. Protestors
marched from the Michigan Union to Cole-
man's house shouting, "education, not segrega-
tion!" before blocking traffic at the intersection
of State Street and South University Ave.
Even after the passage of new in-state
tuition guidelines a few months later, it's still
difficult to tell what CTE might mean for the
larger arc of University narrative. For many,
the movement translated into more than policy

COALITION FOR
TUIT IO N AEQUALITY
H OW A SM A LL G ROUP OF ST UDENTS
UT BEHIND FRINGE ISSUE AND
CHANGED UNIVERSITY POLICY

By Sam Grin glas

tion's member organizations such as the Col-
lege Democrats and the ACLU, held up signs as
Morales spoke. Then, the students walked out.
"We had no idea what we were doing. It was
the first direct action any of us had ever done,"
Lieberman said.
At the time, granting in-state tuition costs
to Michigan's undocumented residents was a
virtually unknown issue on campus. But with
sharp focus on a singular goal - securing in-
state tuition fees for undocumented students
- CTE soon packed regents meetings so tightly
they were moved from a small room inside the
Administration Building to one of the Union's
ballrooms. CTE, and what they stood for,
became unavoidable.
However powerful the coalition's strategy,
its platform was not void of controversy. Tuition
equality, as the issue became branded by advo-
cates, is complicated; it is an issue that tested the
University's ability to respond to student griev-
ances and forced a community to take a hard
look at ideas of citizenship and scholarship.
At the July2013 regentsmeeting, after consis-
tent protests and months spent pouring over the
issue in a task force, regents passed new tuition
equality guidelines bya 6-2vote fromthe regents.
Set to take affect in January2014,undocumented
students who graduated from and attended three
years of a Michigan high school and two preced-
ing years of middle school at a Michigan school
will receive in-state tuition. Under the new
guidelines, military veteranswill also receive in-
state tuition fees, regardless of residency.
In a matter of two years, a small group of
students took on what had been a fringe issue,

rallied support, built their case and ultimately
changed University policy. So how did they do
it?
MAKING A MOVEMENT
In February 2011, Mersol-Barg was gearing
up to run for president of Central Student Gov-
ernment and looking to build a platform that
addressed issues of social justice and diversity.
After attending an event sponsored by student
organization Human Rights through Education,
Mersol-Barg found an issue for his platform.
At the event, a former student fromAnnArbor
spoke about being denied in-state tuition once
the University discovered his undocumented
status. Shortly after the conference, Mersol-
Barg began thinking of ways to engage issues-
facing undocumented students on campus.
To form CTE, Mersol-Barg laid out three
main factors that helped set up a successful
movement.
First, Mersol-Barg chose a coalition structure,
an entity made up of many existing University
groups, which today includes 32 member organi-
zations. He said the coalition was crucialin involv-
ing a large and diverse cross-section of students.
Second, Mersol-Barg said the coalition was
better able to "harness the power of members"
by avoiding leadership hierarchy.
By focusing on a singular goal - one where
students had a tailored perspective to contrib-
ute to the conversation surrounding immigrant
rights - members were able to keep the coali-
tion together.
By June of 2012, it was clear CTE's presence:

at regents meetings would not quietly disappear.
Students showed up to CTE events in droves,
regardless of their relation to undocumented
students. Many viewed CTE's platform as an
issue perfect for student activism - it was a
problem within the larger immigration debate
where student voices mattered.
After Regent Julia Darlow (D-Ann Arbor)
asked the University to explore the issue at the
March 2012 regents meeting, then-Provost Phil
Hanlon created a task force to examine the Uni-
versity's residency guidelines that dictate how
the University grants in-state tuition.
Led by Lester Monts,Vice Provost of Academic
Affairs, the task force included two other admin-
istrators and four CTE members: Mersol-Barg,
Lieberman, Luz Meza, then an LSA senior and
Sanjay Jolly, then a Public Policy senior. With the
goalofproducingareport to present to the regents,
the task force began meeting twice a month.
In interviews with The Michigan Daily,
Monts and the student representatives said they
viewed the task force as an open, collaborative
working environment, while Lieberman and
Jolly said its creation was initially a mechanism
of deference.
"When Phil Hanlon proposed this task force,
it was 100 percent a measure for the University
to drag their feet," Jolly said. "They didn't want
to touch this. They wanted to show the world
that they engage our students and we have a task
force just for this issue."
However, Jolly and Meza said Monts and the
other task force administrators were entirely
genuine throughout the process.
"I don't have words to say how much I appre-

ciate them for working with us," Meza said.
Jolly said Monts encouraged the task force to
leave no stone unturned and to take a meaning-
ful look at the University's undocumented popu-
lation in realms such as campus life, financial
aid and admissions.
In a recent statement to the Daily, Monts
lauded the work of the student committee mem-
bers.
"Given the nature of the issues at hand, there
were often differences of opinion regarding the
interpretation of data and itsimplications for the
creation of a new policy regardingctuition equal-
ity," Monts said. "However, I'm pleased to say
that the report is a product of a consensus build-
ing process that was pervasive in our delibera-
tions."
But throughout much of 2012, University
President Mary Sue Coleman avoided any public
position on tuition equality while the task force
investigated the issue.
In a January 2013 interview with The Michi-
gan Daily, Coleman emphasized the importance
of immigration reform at a state and federal
level, rather than through University gover-
nance.
"It would be so helpful if we could change
things at the state level and do it as a comprehen-
sive plan because I feel it's just an issue this coun-
try has stuck its head in the sand about forever,
and it's not right," Coleman said.
Republican Regent Andrea Fischer Newman,
who voted against the final measure granting in-
state tuition fees along with Republican Regent
Andrew Richner in July, expressed reluctance
similar to Coleman's January 2013 stance.

I's possible that the Coalition for Tuition
Equality's defining moment was neither in
a University Board of Regents meeting nor
inside the Fleming Administration Building.
At his decisive junction, there were no micro-
phones, yellow shiA or senior University offi-
cials -instead, just two guys at a table in a quiet
section of the Shapiro Undergraduate Library.
At nearly four in the morning, Kevin Mersol-
Barg, then a Public Policy junior, and Yonah
Lieberman, an LSA junior at the time, were up
late studying like they did most Sunday nights.
"We'd be in the UGLi talking about stuff, and
Kevin mentions, totally offhand, 'Dan Morales

day,' " Lieberman said in an August interview.
It was February 2012, and Morales, a then
LSA freshman and a current CTE spokesman,
was set to share his experience struggling to
afford a University education before he gained
U.S. residency.
Lieberman, ruminating on class readings
on the Civil Rights Movement, suggested CTE
allies hold up signs to represent the University
student organizations that composed the coali-
tion during the speech.
CTE had 12 members, and Mersol-Barg had
founded CTE only a few months prior to the
regents meeting.
About 30 students, representing the coali-
