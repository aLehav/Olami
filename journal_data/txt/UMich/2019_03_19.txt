Ann Arbor City Council met 
Monday night to discuss the 
affordable housing resolutions 
and the appointments of the 
police oversight commission. 
Affordable 
housing 
issues 
addressed 
the 
Lockwood 
development and developments 
on Main Street and Industrial 
Street. The Lockwood of Ann 
Arbor 
senior 
development 
resolution 
failed, 
while 
three 
resolutions 
dedicated 
to 
an 
affordable 
housing 
development 
passed. 
The 
appointment of 11 nominees to 
the Independent Community 
Police Oversight Commission 
appointment 
was 
passed 
despite 
community 
member 
interruption during the vote.
The Lockwood of Ann Arbor 
Apartments 
development 
is 
a three-story senior housing 

facility proposed to be built 
on a controversial area of 
residential 
land 
near 
the 
intersection of Wagner and 
Jackson roads. The developer 
guaranteed 
40 
percent 
of 
the units to be dedicated to 
affordable 
housing 
ensured 
for 99 years. Many opposing 
councilmembers cited zoning 
ordinances as the reason to 
decline the resolution, as the 
area is currently a single family 
unit zone and the Lockwood 
development 
would 
require 
the council to change it to a 
planned 
unit 
development 
zone. 
Councilmember 
Jeff 
Hayner, D-Ward 1, voted no to 
Lockwood specifically because 
of zoning. 
“It’s a zoning question before 
us,” Hayner said. “To decide, 
I’m going to be asking myself, 
‘Do the community benefits 
offered meet the standards of 

the PUD?’” 
Other 
opposing 
councilmembers 
cited 
environmental 
concerns. 
Councilmember 
Anne 
Bannister, D-Ward 1, discussed 
her 
concerns 
with 
the 
development impinging on the 
dioxane plume treatment site.
“I am very convinced by 
three experts who have told 
us that this property is a key 
location for remediation of the 
plume,” Bannister said. “It is 
near the main plume the source 
site of the dioxane and it is the 
best location, that I’m aware of, 
to pump and treat this chemical 
out of the ground if possible.”
LSA senior Krishna Motta 
and LSA sophomore Hannah 
Bradshaw 
spoke 
to 
the 
council about the importance 
of 
affordable 
housing 
in 
Ann Arbor. Both Motta and 
Bradshaw 
discussed 
how 
affordable 
housing 
affects 

students, 
senior 
citizens 
and 
people 
with 
a 
lower 
socioeconomic 
status. 
They 
pointed 
councilmembers 
to 
multiple resolutions that offer 
various options for the city to 
pursue affordable housing. 
“There’s a lot of options that 
the city has passed up even 
though they say they support 
affordable housing,” Bradshaw 
said. 
“There’s 
some 
great 
resolutions in front of you today 
where you can take action on 
affordable housing and start 
providing for the community. 
Even 
though 
(Ann 
Arbor) 
claims to be a diverse and 
welcoming place, the reality is 
that it’s not for a lot of people in 
a lower socioeconomic status, 
and that’s making your city less 
diverse and less welcoming to a 
lot of people.” 

On 
Monday 
night, 
the 
University of Michigan Central 
Student Government hosted 
a candidate debate for the 
upcoming election March 27 
through 28. The event included 
a presidential debate followed 
by a vice presidential town hall, 
which consisted of 12 questions 

asked by Senior News Editor 
Remy Farkas. The questions, 
compiled by The Daily, touched 
on topics including campus 
climate, 
sustainability 
and 
student body unity.
The event was moderated by 
Director of Debate Aaron Kall.
This 
year’s 
candidates 
include presidential candidate 
Ben 
Gerstein 
and 
vice-
presidential candidate Isabelle 
Blanchard, members of the 
Engage Michigan Party. The 
other presidential candidate 

is Engineering freshman Shub 
Argha, who is running without 
a party.
LSA 
sophomore 
Gerstein 
is from Highland Park, Ill. 
and represents the Engage 
Michigan Party. In his opening 
statement, he described how the 
party’s platform aims to ensure 
students’ voices are heard. 
They also plan on bridging the 
gap between CSG and other 
student organizations, as well 
as 
increasing 
accessibility 
across campus.

“Between Isabelle and I, we 
each have a combined four years 
of experience in CSG.” Gerstein 
said. “(We will work) to make 
sure that every single student 
on 
Michigan 
feels 
valued, 
recognized, heard, has their 
voices and passions elevated 
and understands that CSG’s 
purpose is to work for them 
and to elevate their needs to 
the school’s administration.”

Two 
presidential 
hopefuls 
made their cases before Michigan 
voters for the first time on Monday 
as they seek the Democratic 
nomination for the nation’s highest 
office in 2020, preceding a rally for 
President Donald Trump planned 
for next week in Grand Rapids. 
U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 
D-New York, taped a town hall 
forum with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes 
in Auburn Hills, later appearing 
with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer at a 
“Fems for Dems” rally in Clawson. 
Former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, 
D-Texas, made two campaign 
stops in metro Detroit the same 
day, visiting Center Line and 
Ferndale.
Following 
a 
two-month 
exploratory 
phase, 
Gillibrand 
officially announced her candidacy 
on Sunday. At the Auburn Hills 
town hall just the next day, she 
faced questions about her plan 
to stand out in the crowded 
Democratic primary.

Students not 
shocked by 
admissions 
controversy 
 

Some at ‘U’ say wealthier families can

The Ford School of Public 
Policy and the Center for Russian, 
East 
European, 
& 
Eurasian 
Studies hosted former ambassador 
William J. Burns on Monday 
afternoon 
in 
the 
Annenberg 
Auditorium of Weill Hall to detail 
the inner workings of American 
international 
relations. 
The 
event was this year’s Vandenburg 
Lecture, a series of presentations 
named after former U.S. Sen. 
Arthur 
Vandenburg, 
a 
U-M 
alum, and funded by the Meijer 
Family Foundation. About 35 
people from the Ann Arbor 
community attended the event, 
entitled “American diplomacy in a 
disordered world: A conversation 
with Ambassador William J. 
Burns.”
Burns has held several high-
level positions within the U.S. 
State 
Department 
spanning 
decades of administrations. He 
joined the Foreign Service as a 
career ambassador in 1982.

For 
many 
University 
of 
Michigan students, the recent 
college admissions scandal — 
in which federal prosecutors 
charged 50 people for various 
offenses 
related 
to 
college 
admissions, including buying 
their children entry into some 
of the nation’s most selective 
schools — was not wholly 
surprising.
Lauren Schandevel, Public 
Policy senior, said last week’s 
events highlighted how common 
it is for wealthier families to give 
their children advantages in the 
college process through both 
legal and illegal measures.
“In actuality, this kind of 
stuff happens all the time,” 
Schandevel said. “If not through 
explicitly breaking the law, there 
are plenty of legal ways through 
which 
wealthy 
parents 
can 
give their children a leg up into 
college. I was not surprised when 
I found out that these families 
are actually breaking the law to 
make that kind of thing happen 
because I’ve heard so many 
stories about the legal ways in 
which these things happen.”
The 
scandal, 
which 
was 
revealed 
to 
the 
public 
on 
Tuesday, 
was 
the 
largest 
college 
admissions 
scheme 
ever prosecuted by the United 
States Justice Department and 
sparked discussions nationwide 

about economic inequality in 
selective public and private 
schools. Parents were charged 
with bribing athletic coaches 
and standardized test proctors 
to 
secure 
their 
children 
acceptances into schools such as 
Stanford, Yale and the University 
of Southern California, among 
others. 
The list of parents indicted 
in the scandal included actress 
Lori Loughlin and her husband, 
fashion 
designer 
Mossimo 
Giannulli, along with actress 
Felicity Huffman. After the 
scandal unfolded, USC launched 
an internal investigation into 
the scam and Loughlin was 
fired by Crown Media, the 
media production company that 
previously employed her on 
Hallmark Channel.
According to the indictment 
unsealed in federal court on 
Tuesday, the leader of the 
scheme, William Rick Singer, 
founded the Edge College & 
Career Network in 2007 to 
help parents bribe coaches and 
entrance exam proctors. The 
indictment 
revealed 
parents 
involved in the scandal paid 
Singer between $15,000 and 
$75,000 to have members of the 
organization either take the ACT 
or SAT for the student or correct 
the answers once the test was 
completed.

John Madigan didn’t work for 

The Michigan Daily when he was 

at the University of Michigan. He 

studied business and didn’t have 

any plans to go into the field of 

journalism. He began a career in 

finance and investment banking 

after graduation, and one of his 

clients was The Chicago Tribune. 

After a couple years of working with 

the company, they hired him as a 

CFO in 1975. As he rose through the 

ranks of The Tribune, he eventually 

became CEO and chairman of the 

Tribune Company. 

“I came to greatly appreciate 

what the news people do and how 

hard it is to turn out a story or a 

product that’s completely accurate 

and 
interesting. 
It’s 
not 
easy,” 

Madigan told me when I spoke to 

him on the phone last week. 

Madigan says that’s a big part 

of why he and his wife, Holly, 

decided to give back to The Daily. 

In 2015, they donated the funds 

to support the renovation of The 

Daily’s newsroom and endowed a 

need-based scholarship for Daily 

staff. And now, they’ve given us 

an 
incredibly 
generous 
gift 
of 

more than $300,000 to devote to 

professional development, building 

a diverse newsroom and creating a 

sustainable revenue model for the 

paper. 

“I’m really proud to have run a 

major news organization and the 

least I can do is just give back so 

other people have an opportunity 

to develop themselves so that they 

could do the same someday,” he said. 

The gift will be known as the 

Lipinski Journalism Fund, named by 

the Madigans in honor of Michigan 

Daily alum Ann Marie Lipinski, 

former 
editor 
of 
The 
Chicago 

Tribune. As Madigan told me, he and 

Lipinski became “fast friends” after 

meeting while they both worked at 

The Tribune — they bonded over 

their shared love for the University. 

He said it was Lipinski who helped 

steward him into the world of 

journalism. 

“I needed to learn a lot,” he said. 

“One of the people that really helped 

me along the way was Ann Marie 

Lipinski. That’s part of the reason 

that Holly and I want to honor her 

with this program.” 

Lipinski, who currently works 

as the curator of the prestigious 

Neiman Foundation for Journalism, 

told me she was honored — and 

surprised — to learn the Madigans 

had decided to name the fund after 

her. Like so many of our alumni, she 

has a sentimental attachment to The 

Daily — after all, it’s where she met 

her husband and spent many of her 

college days. Beyond that, though, 

it also served as a sort of classroom 

for her. 

“I had the opportunity to cover 

Chicago politics and to work with 

two reporters — together, we won 

a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the 

Chicago City Council,” she said. 

“But the first time I ever walked 

into a city council meeting in my 

life was in Ann Arbor. I covered the 

City Council for The Daily and I’m 

pretty sure I can draw a straight 

line from that experience to my 

experience in Chicago. There’s 

such clear and direct connection.” 

The Lipinski Journalism Fund 

will allow us to continue this 

tradition of enabling students to 

grow as journalists and people 

through 
experiences 
at 
The 

Daily. Using the Madigans’ gift, 

we will expand our professional 

development efforts by bringing 

veteran 
journalists 
(including 

Daily alumni) into the newsroom 

for short-term fellowships and 

sending staff members out to 

journalism conferences. 

The gift will also help The Daily 

create a new revenue model to 

achieve financial stability so it can 

remain a resource for students on 

campus and aspiring journalists at 

the University.

Additionally, we’ll use the gift 

to help younger students from a 

wide range of backgrounds explore 

journalism 
through 
workshops 

targeted 
toward 
high 
school 

students. 
In 
future 
years, 
The 

Daily plans to run a fully-funded 

residential 
summer 
camp 
that 

will give high schoolers first-hand 

experience with the work we do at 

the paper. 

“I remember opportunities that 

I had as a high school student that 

were hugely influential to me,” 

Lipinski said. “It was this idea that 

somebody would take you seriously 

and see you as somebody ... who 

might be able to have a career in this 

thing that you really loved.” 

The gift will also enable us to 

expand the reach of the scholarships 

we offer at The Daily, in an effort 

to make working at the paper a 

viable experience for students from 

all 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds. 

Ultimately, our goal is to bring the 

feeling of acceptance that Lipinski 

felt both before and during her 

time at The Daily to students of all 

backgrounds — especially those of 

minority identities who might not 

have ever thought of journalism as a 

field they could pursue. 

On behalf of the entire staff of 

The Daily, I want to thank John 

and Holly Madigan and Ann Marie 

Lipinski. We have ambitious goals 

at The Daily — goals that will 

undoubtedly 
require 
financial 

backing to accomplish. With the 

generosity of the Madigans, we can 

continue to improve this paper and 

the staff that run it for years to come. 

Madigan told me on the phone 

last week that if there’s anything he 

hopes to see come out of this fund, 

it’s journalists who are prepared to 

do the work that’s asked of them in 

this world. 

“Journalists are going into so 

many different things than when 

I graduated from school. But I just 

hope that they’re well prepared to 

be very successful. And I just think 

there’s a lot of room for that. I’m 

pleased to do my little thing to help 

that goal.” 

Thank you, Mr. Madigan. We’re 

pleased, too. 

- Maya Goldman, Editor in Chief 

of The Michigan Daily

Senate Assembly elects new SACUA reps, hears from Philbert

Provost discusses value of a University of Michigan education, three out of 10 nominees earn Advisory Committee spots

On Monday, the University of 
Michigan Senate Assembly met 
in the Michigan League, where 
Provost Martin Philbert discussed 
the fiscal context of general higher 
education as well as budget demands 
and changes and investments to 
expect at the University. Elections 
for the Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs were held 
after nominees gave short remarks 
to the group.
Senate Assembly Chair Neil 
Marsh called the meeting to order 
and welcomed Philbert who began 
his presentation by acknowledging 
recent attitude shifts regarding 
educational 
spending 
and 
the 
scrutiny of institutions of higher 
education.

“We in Ann Arbor and other 
campuses around the country are 
constantly accused of being the 
last bastion of liberal thought and 
of actively propelling diversity of 
thought,” Philbert said. “There’s a 
pervasive perception both inside 
our walls as well as outside that 
spending is wasteful, extravagant 
and not transparent.”
Philbert 
countered 
these 
arguments by defending the value 
a bachelor’s degree holds in our 
society, along with research and 
the pursuit and accumulation of 
knowledge.
“Research certainly advances 
knowledge; the whole point of 
scholarship in many regards is to 
uncover new understanding, new 
insight or new knowledge itself, 
and hopefully if not immediately, at 

some point they will become useful 
to society,” Philbert said. “Certainly, 
the University has been, and for the 
foreseeable future will be, one of the 
major conservatories of history and 
culture.”
Philbert continued, articulating 
how 
the 
University 
receives 
funding from a range of sources, 
both private and public, and a 
careful equilibrium of finances 
must be maintained in a changing 
fiscal landscape. He also outlined 
budget goals and priorities, which 
included 
furthering 
academic 
excellence through a commitment 
to 
community 
engagement, 
access and affordability for a U-M 
education to all and enforcing fiscal 
discipline.
“Compared to many of our peers, 
the University receives a modest 

amount of state support per student, 
meaning that we must rely on other 
sources to deliver excellence and to 
provide the wealth of opportunities 
that we do,” Philbert said. “What 
are the goals of our budget here 
at the University of Michigan? 
Always, first and foremost is 
increasing academic excellence — 
enhanced access and affordability is 
something that Mark Schlissel has 
spoken about over and over again, 
and then it has always been there 
in our mission, but Mark has begun 
to talk more forcefully and more 
openly about societal engagement 
and societal impact.”
Philbert 
elaborated 
on 
the 
University’s investment in these 
goals, referencing the Biosciences 
Initiative, 
infrastructure 
development with the Michigan 

Research Cores, the potential of 
augmented-, virtual- and mixed-
reality technology and research on 
poverty solutions. He also reiterated 
the success of programs such as 
Wolverine Pathways, the HAIL 
scholarship and Go Blue Guarantee, 
which provide access to higher 
education for low-income students.
“This is not ivory-tower research 
— faculty and students are deeply 
connected 
with 
communities 
working with local and state 
governments, public schools, health 
care providers and organizations,” 
Philbert said. “With augmented, 
virtual and mixed reality in the 
changing 
landscape 
of 
higher 
education, we’re investing in new 
ways to shape instruction and the 
undergraduate experience for the 
future.”

Philbert remarked specifically 
on 
the 
University’s 
continued 
investment in programs that make 
a U-M education more accessible to 
in-state and low-income students.
“Based on the success of HAIL, 
we’ve transitioned to the Go Blue 
Guarantee, which is free in-state 
tuition for all with a family income 
of less than $65,000,” Philbert said.
Philbert concluded by looking 
ahead to future challenges, like 
a dip in high school graduates in 
Michigan, and acknowledging the 
University’s successes thus far.
“Clearly, we have a national and 
international brand that has been 
able to attract the brightest and 
best,” Philbert said.


Residents 
living 
adjacent 
to the proposed Lockwood 
Apartments issued complaints 
of the development worsening 
the dioxane plume as reason to 
stop the building of the senior 
complex. They also cited the 
alleged lack of care from the 
developer 
to 
environmental 
concerns 
as 
especially 
troubling. 
Public Policy senior Lauren 
Schandevel 
said 
although 
environmental 
concerns 
are 
most 
definitely 
valid 
in these discussions, in the 

history of affordable housing 
conversations, 
excuses 
like 
these are often used to shut 
down these developments. 
“I can understand if (the 
dioxane plume) is a genuine 
concern that they may have,” 
Schandevel 
said. 
“My 
only 
fear is that I’ve witnessed 
other 
conversations 
about 
affordable 
units 
and 
there 
are a lot of excuses made by 
community members that may 
be disingenuous because they 
don’t want ‘those people’ near 
their community, so I think 
that’s something that we have 
to keep in mind.”
Following the discussion of 
affordable housing, the council 

moved onto a vote to confirm the 
nominations to the Independent 
Community Police Oversight 
Commission. The commission 
has been an ongoing concern 
in City Council meetings since 
January 2018, when the Human 
Rights Commission called for 
increased accountability and 
transparency from the Ann 
Arbor Police Department in 
response to incidents linked to 
police brutality, most notably 
the shooting of Aura Rosser 
by an Ann Arbor police officer 
and the rough arrest of Ciaeem 
Slaton by Ann Arbor police 
officers at the Blake Transit 
Center. 
Since the initial call for 

increased 
oversight, 
City 
Council created a task force 
in March 2018 to develop a 
police oversight commission. 
Throughout the development 
of 
the 
commission, 
councilmembers and citizens 
alike have argued over the 
appointment 
of 
commission 
members and the agency of the 
commission.
After months of contentious 
discussion, on March 11, City 
Council announced the names 
of those nominated to the 
Independent Community Police 
Oversight Commission. They 
voted Monday to confirm the 
appointees of the commission. 
The confirmation was passed 

even with community concerns 
and audience interruptions. 
Sargeant 
Donovan-
Smith, a doctoral student in 
anthropology and history at 
the University of Michigan, 
continually 
raised 
concerns 
during City Council about the 
transparency of the selection 
process. Many of Donovan-
Smith’s 
comments 
were 
directed 
at 
Councilmember 
Jane Lumm, I-Ward 2.
“Why 
did 
you 
nominate 
someone 
who 
works 
for 
McKinley 
Properties?” 
Donovan 
asked. 
“Someone 
who 
has 
systematically 
discriminated against formerly 
incarcerated people in Ann 

Arbor? Tell us how these people 
are qualified.”
Mayor Christopher Taylor 
said 
he 
is 
proud 
of 
the 
commission that was chosen. 
The members were nominated 
by by Councilmembers Julie 
Grand, D-Ward 3; Ali Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 5; Elizabeth Nelson, 
D-Ward 4; and Lumm. 
“We strove to work with staff 
to find something that was both 
practical for their purposes and 
for councilmembers,” Taylor 
said. “No system is perfect. 
From my part, I’m comfortable 
with the core picks and the try-
it-out basis. In six months, if 
it’s a disaster, then we’ll either 
know it or they’ll tell us.” 

Argha is from New York City and is 
not running under a party name. After 
several light-hearted anecdotes in his 
opening statement, he highlighted 
how his platform includes improving 
campus sustainability by banning 
plastic water bottles and increasing 
the awareness of CSG across campus. 
He also focused on providing free 
feminine 
hygiene 
products 
to 
University students.
“The last time you went to a 
public restroom, how much did you 
pay for the toilet paper? Nothing, 
right?” Argha asked. “So why is it any 
different for period products? Period 
products are not a luxury but a basic 
human right. This should be free here 
at the University of Michigan and 
everywhere else.”
The event then proceeded with 
questions from Farkas, Kall and 
audience members. One of the first 
issues brought up by the moderators 
was regarding Saturday’s reports of 
an active shooter on campus, which 
were later proven to be unfounded.
Gerstein was randomly chosen 
to respond first via a coin toss. He 
began by describing the importance 
of 
acknowledging 
the 
reality 
of the active shooter threat. He 
emphasized the need of more student 
involvement in the Division of Public 
Safety and Security. Gerstein did not 
acknowledge the current 10-person 
DPSS Student Advisory Board.
“An integral part of Isabelle and 
my campaign … is to make sure there’s 
an active student voice connected 
to DPSS and advising them on ways 
to handle emergency situations on 
campus,” Gerstein said. “Obviously, 
one of the issues that was somewhat 
unclear throughout the entire process 

was the lines of communication and 
the misinformation that were being 
spread through the event.”
Argha responded to the question 
by stating the University community 
needs to take steps to ensure 
responders get to an emergency 
situation as quickly as possible. He 
then connected this issue to a bigger 
dilemma on campus regarding the 
lack of diversity.
“Diversity is a big issue in the 
University of Michigan, and at 
the same time, while we are the 
leaders and the best, we are not the 
leaders and the best when it comes 
to diversity,” Argha said. “That is an 
issue we should all work to resolve, 
and that comes with working with 
CSG and the administration …”
In light of the Climate Strike at the 
University on March 15, candidates 
also discussed their platform on 
sustainability and climate change on 
campus. Argha hopes to implement 
an initiative titled “Ban the Bottle” in 
which he would like to ban all plastic 
water bottles on campus.
“One of my main efforts is also 
to ‘Ban the Bottle’,” Argha said. 
“Banning plastic bottles on campus, 
while it may seem like a small step, 
increases student awareness and 
brings all students together to 
increase sustainability efforts in our 
community, and at the same time, it is 
part of a much bigger plan and a much 
bigger structure.”
Gerstein hopes to address issues 
of climate change and sustainability 
long term by integrating a five-
year sustainability plan. According 
to Engage Michigan, short-term, 
tangible solutions the party hopes 
to implement include providing a 
low-waste grocery shopping guide 
and encouraging students to not buy 
plastic bottles.
“We can work to incentivize 

students to not buy plastic bottles 
and working towards eventually 
becoming a plastic-free campus,” 
Gerstein said. “But ultimately, I think 
the crux of our sustainability platform 
is working with the student body and 
the students most invested in this 
issue to find a comprehensive solution 
we can present to the administration 
that puts our university on the track 
for positive sustainability in five 
years.”
Additionally, candidates discussed 
how, if elected, they would handle 
Title IX issues on campus. At last 
week’s 
CSG 
Student 
Assembly 
meeting, students voiced concerns 
regarding the Sixth Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruling the University must 
provide the chance for the accused 
party to cross-examine the accuser. 
Furthermore, current CSG President 
Daniel Greene, along with Shamina 
Merchant, Ohio State University’s 
student body president, recently sent 
a letter to U.S. Education Secretary 
Betsy 
DeVos 
voicing 
concerns 
regarding 
the 
Department 
of 
Education’s recently proposed Title 
IX regulations.
Gerstein answered by stating 
Engage 
Michigan 
believes 
and 
stands by survivors. He said he 
hopes to consult organizations such 
as the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center and Office 
of Student Conflict Resolution to 
create an environment supportive of 
survivors.
“We need to make sure we’re 
consulting 
relative 
campus 
organizations like SAPAC and OSCR 
and partnering with them on the 
support of this issue,” Gerstein said. 
“Overall, the great thing about how 
we should approach issues of sexual 
misconduct and, specifically, this 
cross-examination policy, is trying 
to create an environment most 

conducive to supporting survivors 
and allowing them to feel comfortable 
and safe at this University.”
Argha discussed placing resources 
like SAPAC and the Spectrum Center 
on the Michigan app as well as 
incorporating these resources into 
freshman orientation. He also hopes 
to change the mentality of sexual 
harassment on campus by working 
with other student organizations 
and does not believe the University 
should turn into a courtroom when 
dealing with Title IX issues.
“Many students at the University 
of Michigan have the Michigan app, 
but SAPAC’s hotline is not on there,” 
Argha 
said. 
“CAPS 
after-hours 
hotline is not on there. Let’s get them 
on there so when we need the help, 
we can get the help. I would also like 
to work with other organizations on 
campus to change our mentality of 
sexual harassment on campus.”
Later in the debate, Gerstein 
and Argha answered questions 
about racial equity and inclusion on 
campus. In a University of South 
California report on racial equity at 
public universities, the University 
received an F in racial equity. 
Candidates discussed the importance 
of diversity, equity and inclusion on 
campus as a whole.
Argha discusses how his identity, 
as someone who grew up in 
Bangladesh, has impacted his time 
at Michigan and encouraged the 
creation of an annual multi-cultural 
event.
“It is not enough for the University 
and our community to want more 
diversity,” Argha said. “We need to 
celebrate diversity in our community, 
and CSG must play an active role. … I 
would like to push for more cultural 
events, at least one every year where 
different organizations can come 
together and put on performances 

and share ideas and educate our 
whole community.”
Gerstein 
understands 
the 
importance of diversity, equity and 
inclusion. According to Gerstein, the 
students of color resolution mandates 
CSG representatives attend student 
of color organization meetings once 
per month.
“From those smaller initiatives, 
we allow the greater Michigan 
community 
to 
understand 
the 
perspectives 
and 
experiences 
of students of color and other 
marginalized 
students 
at 
the 
University, and can work through 
that understanding, to understand 
the importance of diversity, equity, 
and inclusion on our campus as a 
whole,” Gerstein said.
After a five-minute break, debate 
resumed with a town hall with 
Blanchard, the only vice-presidential 
candidate running this year.
One 
of 
the 
questions 
the 
moderators 
asked 
Blanchard 
pertained to the lack of diversity 
within CSG itself. The December 2018 
CSG demographic report revealed 
nearly 60 percent of representatives 
identified 
as 
white. 
Blanchard 
responded by acknowledging the 
statistic and expanding upon how to 
diversify.
“I think there’s definitely an 
issue with demographics of CSG,” 
Blanchard said. “I think especially for 
low socioeconomic-status students, 
this is definitely an issue prevalent for 
them. I think there is a lot of work that 
needs to be done, and I think the first 
step to that is really talking to these 
students who feel that they are facing 
these issues to gain more insight.”
Moderators further questioned 
Blanchard about affordability on 
campus. Blanchard explained the 
importance of affordability in regards 
to tuition but explains that there are 

other areas of affordability that should 
be addressed as well. Specifically, she 
touched upon academic affordability 
by increasing resources in the library 
and subsidizing homework access 
codes and food affordability.
“I 
think 
there’s 
also 
food 
affordability 
issues 
that 
were 
mentioned before, and I think 
increasing public microwaves on 
campus is an indirect solution to the 
problem where it helps encourage 
and allow students to bring their own 
food from home, rather than having 
to buy food from campus,” Blanchard 
said.
To end of both the presidential and 
vice-presidential debates, Kall asked 
each candidate to express something 
complimentary about their opponent 
and talk about how they look forward 
to working with their opponent in the 
future if they do not win the election.
Argha was selected to respond 
first, stating a common goal of 
bettering the University.
“I’ve spoken to Ben, I met with 
Isabelle, and I love that you guys are 
running such a great campaign. You 
have a beautiful website and I love 
the platform that you’re running on to 
get Michigan involved, and that is one 
of the main steps towards making 
Michigan beautiful just the way it is.”
Gerstein complemented Argha on 
his candidacy and hopes to improve 
the Michigan experience together.
“Shub, I want to compliment you 
on running as a first-year student and 
caring so much about the needs of 
this university and the needs of the 
students.” Gerstein said. “Regardless 
of whether I win or not, I look 
forward to continuing to advocate for 
our platform and continuing to make 
the Michigan experience better for 
every student, regardless of their 
identity.”

Schandevel said while these 
extreme 
measures 
indicate 
how wealthy students are given 
numerous 
advantages 
during 
the college admissions process, 
the fact some public schools are 
given more extensive funding 
than others is one of the biggest 
ways students are benefited 
when applying to college. 
In January 2018, Schandevel 
started Being Not-Rich at UM: 
A Guide, a 115-page document 
offering advice to lower-income 
students about how to adapt to 
life at the University, to help 
bridge some of the gaps between 
students 
who 
come 
from 
wealthier school districts and 
those who do not.
“It’s really clear that higher 
education sort of reinforces 
this economic and subsequently 
racial hierarchy,” Schandevel 
said. “Even if you don’t send your 
kid to a private school, you still 
have a public school system that’s 

predicated on the notion that 
local taxes will supplement state 
and federal funding. When you 
have that policy, it advantages 
wealthy 
districts 
over 
poor 
districts and sets those poor 
districts up to fail automatically. 
So even if you’re in the public 
school system, the American 
education system is still favoring 
wealthy people.”
In response to the scandal, 
University 
Public 
Affairs 
released a statement condemning 
the indicted parents’ actions 
and reaffirming the University’s 
commitment to a fair admissions 
process.
“At the University of Michigan, 
we use a comprehensive, holistic 
approach 
to 
review 
every 
candidate 
for 
admission 
to 
identify a talented, diverse class 
of students who will flourish 
on our campus,” the statement 
reads. 
“We 
engage 
multiple 
readers and reviews in evaluating 
the full set of credentials offered 
for consideration.”
Students related the recent 
scandal with wealth disparities 

present at the University, even 
though 
the 
University 
was 
not involved with the scheme. 
Griffin St. Onge, LSA senior and 
co-chair of Affordable Michigan, 
a 
student 
organization 
representing 
low-income 
students, said she wished the 
University would focus more on 
the needs of students who are 
first-generation or come from 
schools with fewer resources.
“I think if Michigan as a public 
university that is always striving 
for that ‘uncommon education 
for the common man’ thing, I 
think if they feel an obligation to 
fulfill that goal, then there needs 
to be a lot more effort,” St. Onge 
said.
Even 
so, 
St. 
Onge 
said 
programs 
like 
the 
HAIL 
scholarship, which began in 
2016 and offers full tuition 
scholarships to accomplished 
students 
from 
low-income 
backgrounds, have made some 
progress in bridging the wealth 
disparity gap although there is 
still work to be done. 
“They’ve 
done 
a 
lot 
of 

previous things with the HAIL 
scholarship and they’ve been 
trying to go out to different 
communities, but I think there 
needs to be a bigger conversation 
of where are we getting our 
students from, how are we 
supporting our students who are 
low-income or first-generation 
who do come here and end up 
in a very different environment 
where 
they 
need 
additional 
support,” St. Onge said.
A report by the Equality of 
Opportunity Project — cited in 
The New York Times’ The Upshot 
in 2017 — found the median 
family income of a student at 
the University is $154,000, the 
highest of 27 public colleges 
classified as “highly selective”. 
A 
report 
from 
the 
Detroit 
Free Press also found that the 
graduation rate for Pell Grant 
recipients at the University is 
86.9 percent, as opposed to a 92.5 
percent graduation rate for non-
Pell Grant recipients.
University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald wrote in an email 
interview with The Daily that 

the University’s overall high 
graduation rates still make a 
University 
degree 
a 
worthy 
investment.
“A 
family’s 
investment 
in a University of Michigan 
education 
is 
a 
good 
one,” 
Fitzgerald wrote. “A consistent 
97 percent of students return 
for their sophomore year, and 
92 percent graduate from our 
Ann 
Arbor 
campus 
within 
six years — among the best 
retention and graduation rates 
in the nation. These are positive 
proof points that we share often 
with prospective students and 
families.”
Joseph 
Aranoff, 
LSA 
sophomore, said the scandal 
revealed some of the illegal 
ways wealthy parents give their 
children 
advantages 
in 
the 
college process, but also said 
he doesn’t think these illegal 
methods do not reflect the 
majority of wealthy students at a 
university. 
“I think everybody that’s 
here at this university deserves 
to be here, and if we’re judging 

people of means and of wealth 
and making the assumption 
that they don’t deserve to be 
here because somehow their 
wealth is equivalent to a bribe, 
it’s a dangerous precedent,” 
Aronoff said. “Just because you 
have the means to attend a good 
university doesn’t negate the 
work you had to do to get there.”
Students 
also 
noted 
how 
the 
consideration 
of 
legacy 
status in admissions decisions 
favors students from wealthier 
backgrounds. 
A 
student 
is 
considered a legacy applicant 
if a member of their family 
is an alum of the University. 
Fitzgerald wrote in an email 
interview with The Daily that 
while the University does take 
legacy status into account, that 
factor alone does not determine 
the admission of an applicant.
“The university also considers 
alumni ties, but it is not a 
primary factor in admissions 
decisions,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote. 
“Alumni ties can be a useful 
indicator of a student’s interest 
in the university.”

From there, he served as 
ambassador to Jordan from 1998 
to 2001; assistant secretary of state 
for Near Eastern Affairs from 2001 
to 2005; ambassador to Russia 
from 2005 to 2008; secretary for 
political affairs from 2008 to 2011; 
and deputy secretary of state to 
under the Obama administration 
from 2011 to 2014.
Burns is currently the president 
of the Carnegie Endowment for 
International Peace, a foreign 
policy think tank focused on 
promoting peaceful policy among 
government 
leaders, 
business 
leaders and civil society. 
Public Policy Dean Michael 
Barr facilitated the conversation 

as a promotional event for Burns’ 
new book, “The Back Channel: A 
Memoir of American Diplomacy 
and the Case for Its Renewal.” 
Barr asked Burns to define 
what diplomacy means to him and 
Burns started with a preliminary 
definition.
“Diplomacy is what we do to 
promote our interests and values 
abroad, to try and persuade other 
government to act in ways that are 
consistent with ours,” Burns said.
Burns attempted to clear up 
common 
misunderstandings 
about how diplomats work.
 “(There’s) the notion that 
diplomacy is just about talking 
nicely to people, or indulging 
foreign leadership — something 
that I think the president himself 
sometimes is guilty of — but the 
truth is, diplomacy is hard work, 

and it’s about that persistence,” 
Burns said.
Much of the discussion centered 
around Burns’ reflections on prior 
administrations and how they 
handled international relations. 
He described his work under 
the Reagan, H.W. Bush, Clinton, 
Bush, and Obama administrations 
within the Middle East, and 
emphasized that diplomacy can be 
a dangerous career. According to 
Burns, more American diplomats 
have died in the past several 
decades than military generals. 
Burns shared what he observed 
to be important for a leader to 
succeed in international relations.
“You’re never going to get 
very far in effective diplomacy 
or effective foreign policy if you 
don’t have a vision, if you don’t 
a strategy, if you don’t (have) a 

theory of what’s animating the 
international landscape, of what 
your own strengths are, and 
connecting ends to means,” Burns 
said. “You need to have that vision, 
and the best presidents and the 
best secretaries of state that I’ve 
seen and worked for have that.”
When discussing the tough 
decisions a diplomat has to make, 
Burns expressed regret in his role 
under then-Secretary of State 
Colin Powell regarding the choice 
to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
“Given 
all 
the 
sectarian 
differences and grievances and 
anger that that rigid and autocratic 
regime was sitting on, once 
you take that lid off, you could 
imagine some of the sectored and 
political consequences that would 
happen,” Burns said. “My greatest 
professional regret, as I say in the 

book, is not acting more effectively 
to underscore those concerns.”
Burns criticized how President 
Donald Trump’s State Department 
handles international relations, 
noting how following a process 
can seem inefficient at times, 
but the absence of process is also 
troublesome.
“My concern in the current era 
and this administration is that 
I don’t really see any process,” 
Burns said. “Policy gets driven 
from tweet to tweet. I say that 
because we’ve been fortunate that 
as we’re almost two and a half 
years into this administration, 
and there hasn’t been a prolonged 
international crisis yet. Those are 
the moments when you need a 
process that’s disciplined.”
Barr asked Burns about his 
views on a variety of prevalent 

international 
issues, 
including 
the country’s relationship with 
Russia, the Iran nuclear deal, the 
Syrian civil war and Saudi Arabia’s 
conflict with Yemen. Burns shared 
an anecdote from meeting Russian 
President Vladimir Putin on his 
first day as ambassador to the 
country.
“In your first meeting (as an 
ambassador), you present your 
credentials,” Burns said. “Before 
I can hand him my letter (of 
credentials), 
President 
Putin 
saunters forward and says, ‘You 
Americans need to listen more. 
You can’t have everything your 
own way anymore. We can have 
effective relations, but not just on 
your terms.’”

M

ost, if not all, of my 
favorite memories in 
my entire 

life take place inside 
a 
national 
park. 

There was the time 
I climbed a 14,000-
foot 
mountain 

located in a national 
forest in Colorado, 
or the time I spent 
multiple 
days 

hiking in beautiful 
Zion National Park 
in Utah. One of my 
most 
surreal 
experiences 

occurred laying on a beach 
in Acadia National Park in 
Maine, staring up at more 
stars than I had ever seen 
at 
one 
time, 
connecting 

them to form constellations 
and seeing the Milky Way 
shine brilliantly across the 
expansive 
night 
sky. 
My 

times in the national parks 
are what have driven my 
passion for the outdoors and 
my relationship with the 
environment. It is difficult to 
see these places and not leave 
with a profound discovered 
respect for the natural world.

This 
is 
not 
a 
unique 

sentiment. 
The 
national 

parks are visited each year by 
hundreds of millions. Summer 
is one of the most popular 
times for the parks, especially 
among students looking for 
a more adventurous summer 
break than the typical beach 
trip.

There 
is 
no 
doubt 

that 
today 
the 
National 

Park Service is one of the 
most beloved and enjoyed 
government agencies and is 
often something supported by 
both major parties. The first 
national park was Yellowstone 
in Montana and Wyoming, 
established in 1872. It wasn’t 
until Woodrow Wilson came 
around that the National Park 
Service was created under the 
“Organic Act” in 1916.

Before going further, I feel 

it is important to talk about 
something often overlooked 
in the history of the national 
parks: 
the 
indigenous 

people 
who 
inhabited 
the 

land. Parks such as Glacier, 
Badlands, Mesa Verde, the 
Grand 
Canyon 
and 
Death 

Valley were, as an article by 
Hanne Elisabeth Tidnam in 
Medium 
describes, 
“taken 

from the Native American 
communities that lived within 
them as part of the United 
States 
government’s 
larger 

efforts to relocate and remove 
them.” The establishment of 

Yosemite drove out 
the Ahwahneechee 
people 
who 
had 

inhabited the land 
for 
thousands 
of 

years prior.

This is just one 

example in a laundry 
list 
of 
injustices 

carried out against 
indigenous nations 
by 
the 
United 

States 
government 

throughout 
history. 
It 
is 

important to include this part 
of the narrative when talking 
about 
the 
national 
parks. 

Current campaigns like Stop 
the Con are aimed at raising 
awareness 
around 
issues 

involving 
conservation 
and 

indigenous people globally. The 
parks are beautiful monuments 
to nature that millions of 
Americans enjoy every year, but 
to disregard their complicated 
past would be irresponsible.

Recently, President Donald 

Trump’s 
administration 

surprised many by signing an 
expansive public lands bill 
that actually expanded the 
amount of protected land and 
permanently reauthorized the 
Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, which supports efforts 
to 
conserve 
and 
promote 

outdoor recreation nationwide. 
Environmentalists 
hailed 

this as a major victory in 
an administration that has 
historically 
championed 

slashing 
 
as 
much 

environmental regulation as 
possible. National Geographic 
keeps 
a 
comprehensive 

running 
list 
of 
how 
the 

president is affecting the 
environment, and it is mostly 
all bad news. Could this 
be a turning point for the 
president?

Unfortunately, it doesn’t 

look like this is the case. 
President 
Donald 
Trump 

released the Department of 
the Interior’s Fiscal Year 2020 

budget this week, and it deals 
devastating blows to public 
lands and the national parks. 
Thankfully, as Wes Siler for 
Outside said, “the president 
does not set the official 
budget — Congress does.” 
While it is extremely unlikely 
that this version of the budget 
ever gets passed, it still 
highlights where the current 
administration’s 
priorities 

lie.

All of this comes just a 

few months after the longest 
government 
shutdown 
in 

history, which left many of 
our beloved national parks 
unprotected for days — if not 
weeks — on end. During the 
shutdown, many of the parks 
suffered damages as staffing 
was 
drastically 
reduced. 

Joshua Tree in California, for 
example, suffered damages 
to its ecosystem that could 
remain for over 300 years as 
vandals came and cut down 
the 
protected 
trees 
from 

which the park gets its name.

Headlines like these are 

extremely 
concerning 
to 

those who value the parks. 
What can be done?

By all means, I highly 

encourage 
traveling 
to 

national 
parks. 
Michigan 

is actually home to a few 
nationally 
protected 
areas 

such as Pictured Rocks, Isle 
Royale, 
and 
the 
Sleeping 

Bear Dunes, which are each 
breathtaking in their own 
way. But we collectively need 
to do a better job of caring for 
these lands and treating them 
with respect. That means 
recognizing their complicated 
history 
and 
actively 

cherishing the land. It also 
means 
providing 
adequate 

funding for conservation and 
maintenance needs.

If you do find yourself 

traveling to one or multiple 
locations in the future, it is 
crucially important to be 
mindful of your surroundings 
and take care to not disturb 
the environment around you. 
As the old saying goes: “Take 
nothing but pictures, leave 
nothing but footprints, and 
kill nothing but time.” In line 
with its original directive, 
we need to make sure to 
leave the parks unimpaired 
for the enjoyment of future 
generations.

I 

cannot pay attention.

In an age in which 

we are so thoroughly 

interconnected, 
there 
is 

always something else to do. 
Something to read, 
to look up, to watch, 
to 
communicate 

— there is always 
something. 
Being 

forthright, 
while 

writing 
this, 
I 

probably checked my 
phone, went on social 
media and worked 
on an assignment. 
With 
information 

so 
accessible, 

constant 
distraction 
feels 

inevitable. This inability to 
entirely devote my attention 
to something for an extended 
period 
of 
time 
has 
only 

gotten worse and this lack of 
discipline has seeped into all 
aspects of my life.

Family 
gatherings, 

hanging out with friends, 
class — the dynamics of how 
we interact are different given 
that 
almost 
everyone 
has 

access to devices that allow 
them to divert their attention 
elsewhere. It is one thing to 
look up further information 
on something in class. It is 
another thing entirely to miss 
out on what is happening 
around you.

This sounds like something 

that may have an easy solution 
— simply just putting one’s 
laptop away or phone down 
should do the trick. But in a 
society in which we are so 
dependent on technology, is 
that even really feasible? I 
have, along with many college 
students, become entirely too 
accustomed to living with the 
ability to access information 
whenever and wherever I 
want and a transition away 
from 
such 
could 
prove 

difficult.

My 
struggle 
to 
pay 

attention has taken away my 
ability to live in the moment.

Growing up, my mom’s 

response to being on phones 

was always, “Live in the 
moment” — and she was 
right. Due to the reality that 
my 
brain 
is 
consistently 

multi-tasking, I cannot fully 

appreciate what is 
going on around 
me.

Within 
the 

last few months, 
I 
came 
to 
the 

determination that 
taking 
a 
social 

media hiatus would 
cut back on my 
technology 
usage 

and allow for me 
to participate more 

fully in what is happening 
in the present, instead of 
viewing life through edited 
squares and filtered posts. 
While this worked for some 
time, my dependence on not 
necessarily just my phone, 
but 
access 
to 
distraction, 

remains. I still use my phone 
just as often as I would have 
beforehand, 
maybe 
just 

approaching 
social 
media 

with more of a second thought 
than before.

This leads me to pose the 

question: How can I live more 
in the moment and move 
past this persistent need to 
always be doing something? 
Can I, with the prevalence 
of interconnectedness, take 
a step back and just be? I do 
not know. I could put my 
phone away, use it less or 
not bring my computer to 
class as a means to ensure I 
pay full attention, but would 
these disciplined choices be 

drawbacks in a society in 
which usage of technology is 
almost expected?

With 
these 
resolutions 

come the fear that, without 
technology, I will fall behind. 
I will not be caught up on the 
latest piece of news, what 
is going on with friends or 
family or even the weather. 
I will not be fully equipped 
to 
manage 
my 
day-to-day 

without the possibility to 
be efficient and juggle the 
differing expectations. This 
anxiety that I could always 
be doing something else takes 
away from focusing on one 
thing and doing it well. 

While I understand this 

might not pose an issue for 
everyone, many of us seem 
to live in this frantic manner 
in which technology is an 
omniscient presence — an 
accessory to our being. This 
has caused a counteraction, 
with many, some ironically on 
social media, saying that they 
are going to “unplug.” This 
movement away has become 
in vogue, but is it possible?

Moving forward, living in 

the moment will be a priority. 
I can do so much more if I 
figure out how to silence the 
noise of constant distraction 
or the temptation to check 
my phone in class or at work. 
I can be without having to 
think about the next thing. 
I want to be able to sit and 
have a conversation, read a 
book or finish something for 
school without having the 
urge to try and accomplish 
numerous things at once. I 
want to be able to rid myself 
of the inability to be present 
that technology has created 
by firmly establishing myself 
within a singular moment. 
I cannot pay attention — 
and maybe I should start by 
putting my phone down first.

SAMANTHA SZUHAJ | COLUMN

I 

am writing in response 
to The Michigan Daily’s 
coverage of the incident 

on Saturday. While I really 
appreciated 
the 
care 
and 

sensitivity with which the 
writers approached this topic, 
as well as the discussions of the 
ways the incident particularly 
affected Muslim and minority 
students, I have to take issue 
with one detail — the way The 
Daily presented the role of 
word-of-mouth 
information 

during 
the 
events. 
While 

misinformation and the spread 
of rumors should, of course, 
generally be discouraged and 
in this particular case such 
rumors did more harm than 
good, I don’t think it is wise 
to discourage students from 
texting their peers and friends 
during potentially dangerous 
situations. In the absence of 
official news, which, like all 
sources of human knowledge, is 
fallible, these fleeting rumors 
and texts are all we have. On 
Saturday we didn’t need them, 

and now we condemn them. But 
imagine a day when we do 
— 

when there is a real dangerous 
situation and official sources 
are not responding. Word-of-
mouth 
information, 
despite 

its easy and frequent misuse, 
could mean life or death in a 
real active shooter situation. 
As the famous proverb says, 
better safe than sorry 
— and 

better confused and scared 
than dead.

Communicating through crisis

Tuesday, March 19, 2019 — 5

This week the book review will 
be featuring works from Gimmick 
Press, a independent publisher of 
niche literature and art based in 
Plymouth, Michigan. Gimmick 
was established in 2015 by Josh 
Olsen and Katie MacDonald with 
a commitment to diversity and 
inclusion of both subject matter 
and voice throughout all aspects 
of their work. Gimmick publishes 
digitally 
through 
“Worthless 
Treasures” and calls for printed 
chapbook 
and 
anthology 
submissions 
throughout 
the 
year. They’re currently accepting 
submissions for an anthology of 
creative nonfiction about pop 
culture obsessions.
“Three-Way 
Dance,” 
a 
collaborative effort combining 
work by Michael Chin, Frankie 
Metro and Brian Rosenbacher, 
is a collection of creative work 
on professional wrestling. This 
singularity is not particularly 
rare; there are lots of only-
one-on-this-topic books, and 
the 
professional 
wrestling 
niche is practically its own 
genre. The onslaught of books 
about very specific subjects 
(historically 
significant 
beverages, insomnia, dirt, the 

evolution of houses) usually sits 
comfortably in nonfiction, but 
“Three-Way Dance” entirely 
shuns jovial didacticism. This 
is no Bill Bryson romp through 
the 
glut 
of 
WWE 
(World 
Wrestling 
Entertainment, 
Inc. Stay with me) — it’s 
Allen Ginsberg as a Reddit 
poet, “Fight Club” starring 
“Arrested 
Development” 
era 
Michael Cera, a fully plausible 
analogy for the palatial scale 
of absurdity in American life. 
Like 
professional 
wrestling 
itself, the collection is cheesy 
and heartbreaking, true but not 
real.
For those who are unfamiliar, 
professional wrestling is an 
orchestrated 
performance: 
a match whose outcome is 
decided 
beforehand, 
whose 
every move is predetermined 
and practiced. Fight becomes 
theater, 
thrill, 
spectacle, 
a concertina of pain (real, 
manufactured) and glory (the 
same) packaged for maximum 
entertainment. WWE is the 
biggest professional wrestling 
corporation 
in 
the 
United 
States. It’s a conglomerate that 
includes 
a 
film 
production 
wing 
(animated 
and 
live 
action), a publishing sector for 
biographies and calendars, a 
fleet of private jets and even 

a music studio that releases 
albums of entrance music as 
well as songs sung by wrestlers 
(John 
Cena’s 
“You 
Can’t 
See Me,” for example). I say 
this 
because 
it’s 
important 
to 
understand 
the 
giddy, 
unhinged hugeness of WWE, 
the enormous size and scope of 
its excesses.
Neither 
informative 
nor 

consistently beautiful, “Three-
Way Dance” is simply weird. 
What’s so captivating about 
the collection is the exhausting 
comprehensiveness 
of 
the 
authors’ 
infatuation 
with 
a wacko slice of American 
culture, this overlooked world 
of 
violent 
dramaturgy 
and 
faithful spectatorship.

“Fritz Von Erich wasn’t a 
Nazi soldier, but he played one 
in the ring in the 1960s,” writes 
Chin in “The Family Trade.” 
What a way to start a poem! 
The whole book is shot through 
with a sense of the surreal: 
“Was it that you were the first 
white dude I ever saw wearing 
a do-rag, a fashion plate / 
Before your time, well before 

Hulkmania, and I can’t believe 
your fuzzy boots never / Caught 
on 
with 
the 
mainstream,” 
Rosenbacher writes.
For Chyna, one of the only 
female professional wrestlers, 
Chin writes an ode: “You signed 
a new contract. This time with 
Red Light District Video. A 
distributor for your homemade 

sex tape. They called it, ‘One 
Night in China.’”
In “Todo Lo Malo,” Metro 
writes, “It seemed only right 
to take a pound of flesh as 
a souvenir, maybe not a full 
pound, thought El Matarife, 
as he commenced to digging at 
the boy’s right eye and finally 
removing it, tossing it into the 
horrified/elated crowd.”
Split 
into 
three 
distinct 
sections by author, “Three-
Way 
Dance” 
never 
feels 
cohesive or purposeful. The 
jarring 
differences 
between 
the 
authors’ 
styles 
and 
formats pushes the book into 
dangerous territory; meaning 
is often obscured in exchange 
for 
unsatisfying 
simplicity 
or confusing distortion. This 
would be more of a problem if 
professional wrestling didn’t 
offer up so many incredible 
tidbits, so much rich material to 
be transformed.
Luckily, WWE has nearly 
everything: gender, childhood 
obsessions, 
money, 
sex, 
consumption, race. Facades of 
control, appearances, histories. 
You watch knowing the fight 
is a sham, that it’s made up, 
but your eyes insist this must 
be real: the contact of face on 
mat, fist on face, teeth forced 
into gums and bones into 

muscle. It’s love, death, failure, 
opulence. It’s all fake.
“Three-Way 
Dance” 
is 
unafraid of these contradictions. 
Instead, 
Chin, 
Metro 
and 
Rosenbacher embrace the ways 
professional wrestling presents 
a version of the world and then 
immediately negates it. The 
book is a tempest, directionless 
and unpredictable, and within 
that mess sentences often jump 
out for their succinct loveliness. 
Rosenbacher, in “O is for Ole 
Anderson 
and 
Ox 
Baker”: 
“2nd best bet – Ox Baker’s 
heart punch. / It landscapes 
cemeteries.”
A heart punch, landscaping 
cemeteries: what a startling gem 
in a jumble of truly mediocre 
poetry. This book is full of 
awful lines (“It is in falling that 
we might rise,” Chin writes in 
“The Falls”), but when it’s good, 
it’s good. Which is sort of like 
wrestling, in a way. When it’s 
bad, when you see through it, 
when the fight is boring, you’re 
reminded of the falseness of 
the whole enterprise. But when 
it’s good the fight takes on an 
eternal drama, something that 
(like literature) both requires 
and rewards faithful attention. 
“Like Icarus who dared to 
touch the Sun / Like Icarus who 
dared to burn too brightly.”

Horrified and elated: Professional wrestling literature

I can appreciate the old-timey 
charm of “The Sting,” the wit 
and absolute hilarity of “Snatch” 
and even the sub-par jokes in 
“Tower Heist.” That said, there 
is secret sauce to any heist 
movie, an imperative ingredient 
without which the plotline will 
inevitably fall flat. So, what 
makes a heist movie solid? It 
isn’t really about the heist at 
all. It’s about the characters. 
Unfortunately, “Triple Frontier” 
doesn’t 
follow 
this 
golden 
rule from the heist handbook. 
Though stacked with a star-
studded cast and a potentially-
intriguing storyline, Netflix’s 
latest release only manages to 
offer guns, brawny men, money 
and more guns, failing to include 
any relationship development, 
humor or substantial flavor.
The 
film 
begins 
in 
classic-heist fashion, with 
a 
group 
of 
ex-Special 
Forces 
operatives 
reuniting with the shared 
motive of filling their 
wallets. Leader of the pack 
Santiago 
(Oscar 
Isaac, 
“Ex Machina”) reveals his 
intentions to rob a high-profile, 
South American cocaine lord, 
Lorena, who is known to be 
swimming in money. Though 
not without coaxing, Santiago 
manages to convince former 
operatives and friends to put 
their honored reputations as war 
heroes on the line and embark 
on the ultimate heist, for a shot 
at the massive jackpot. However, 
Santiago and company quickly 
find themselves in for more than 
they bargained for, when their 
swift plan to get the money, 
take out Lorena and split goes 
awry. In short, the men soon find 
themselves on a nightmarishly 
long 
journey 
across 
South 

America, racking up a troubling 
body count and falling under the 
dangerous spell of greed.
In order to care about an 
elaborate plan to finesse the 
system and finagle millions of 
dollars, we first have to care 
about who is doing the finessing 
and finagling. While the film is 
chalk full of talented actors like 
Ben Affleck (“Justice League”), 
Charlie Hunnam (“A Million 
Little Pieces”) and Pedro Pascal 
(“If Beale Street Could Talk”), 
through such weak dialogue 
and little to no background, 
there is no real inclination to 
invest in these men or their 
operation. The link between 
the five men behind the heist is 
clear: They are all buddies from 
their back-in-the-day military 
careers. But the existence of 
this link alone isn’t enough to 
convince us of the emotions 
and friendship between the 
characters. Aside from scenes 

of them shooting or being shot 
at, the only other interactions 
between 
the 
men 
revolve 
around drinking or having dull 
conversations. Though the film’s 
use of five central characters has 
opportunity for development, 
(i.e. establishing one member 
of the gang as the funny one, 
another as the cynic and so 
on) by not taking the time to 
thoroughly 
distinguish 
each 
character’s 
personality, 
they 
become 
interchangeable 
and 
awkwardly all morph into one.
Along with its overall lack of 
life-blood, the film’s portrayal 
of 
gender 
and 
masculinity 
is frustrating. The level of 

testosterone in “Triple Frontier” 
is so high that it practically 
radiates through the screen. 
Yes, guns and dollar-bills are 
quintessential staples in any 
heist flick, but that doesn’t mean 
either should be treated with 
the same importance as the 
characters themselves. The very 
fact that filmmakers include 
entire scenes of money being 
burned or dramatically flying 
in the wind, but cannot manage 
to 
create 
semi-entertaining 
character 
conversations 
or 
connections, 
is 
undeniably 
problematic.
Further, throughout the film 
there are quips about Santiago’s 
informant 
Yovanna 
(Adria 
Arjona “Pacific Rim: Uprising”), 
a beautiful woman in need of 
his help rescuing her brother 
from police captivity. Without 
fail, the other men consistently 
bring up Santiago’s “girlfriend,” 
boyishly aiming to tease him 
(and successfully irritating 
us). The film’s reiteration of 
Yovanna’s looks and hints 
at an underlying chemistry 
between her and Santiago, 
despite her minimal screen 
time and lines, is a tired and 
weak attempt to slap a side-
story onto the already poor 
main plotline. Quite simply, we 
needed more from the film, but 
a poorly constructed romance 
wasn’t it.
“Triple Frontier” was not 
doomed from the start. The 
film could have adhered both 
to 
genre 
conventions 
like 
money, weapons and long-lost 
friendships, while still crafting 
an 
element 
of 
originality 
through fun character personas. 
But instead, it relies entirely on 
the former and does nothing 
to create the latter. By not fully 
utilizing its talented cast and 
focusing too heavily on the heist 
framework, the movie loses itself 
and its viewers.

‘Triple Frontier’ is a bad 
romp full of testosterone

Triple Frontier 

Netflix

SAMANTHA NELSON
Daily Arts Writer

Once upon a time, there 
was Karen O, frontwoman for 
the early 2000s rock band, 
the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. There 
was also hip-hop artist turned 
music producer Danger Mouse. 
One day, they decided to unite 
their respective powers to gift 
humanity the ultimate musical 
collaboration of 2019 (thus far): 
Lux Prima. 
Lux Prima, at its core, is a 
story. Together, Karen O and 
Danger Mouse weave together 
dreams, presenting an album 
which is fluid, authentic and 
unbound by any limitations. 
The 
nine-track 
album 
is 
characterized 
by 
seamless 
transitions 
and 
natural 
progressions.
The 
title 
track 
“Lux 
Prima” 
opens 
softly, 
slowly warming up like 
the 
introduction 
to 
a 
good book, or drowsily 
climbing from slumber 
on a Sunday morning. 
The track is long, nearing 
eight 
minutes, 
but 
it 
never 
feels 
overdone. 
The surreal echoes of the 
“Lux 
Prima” 
envelope 
the listener like a warm 
breeze — all at once sad, 
comforting and hopeful. Vocals 
are minimal for the majority of 
the song, instead emphasizing 
the dreamlike atmosphere of 
the track. One feels almost as if 
they’re drifting aimlessly along 
a lazy river.
Then, Karen O and Danger 
Mouse take the audience for an 
unexpected but very welcome 
spin. As the track nears on 
minute three, where most songs 
would usually come to an end, 
the electronic ambiance fades 
out, replaced by steady drum 
beat. It’s as if O and Danger 

Mouse have shifted gears, or 
flipped on a new track. It is a 
song hidden within a song — a 
plot twist that could rival the 
best of ABC’s Thursday night 
television lineup. Then, by 
the six-minute mark the song 
abruptly transitions back to 
the same soft sound waves of 
the introduction, but rather 
than falling to an end the track 
ramps up for the rest of this 
powerhouse album. 
The 
following 
tracks 
“Ministry” 
and 
“Turn 
the 
Light” are good, but largely 
unremarkable 
on 
their 
own. Rather, they are more 
important in the context of the 
album, building the momentum 
to 
the 
album’s 
climax: 
“Woman” and “Redeemer.”
“Woman” is the highlight 
of the album — and the song is 
everything it should be with 
a name like that. Powerful, 

strong and dominant, O comes 
roaring in with a distinct surge 
of energy. The song feels like 
an assertion of her identity 
and womanhood. It’s the type 
of unapologetic, sassy, foot-
tapping song that you can’t 
help but rock out to. “Woman” 
easily steals the thunder of 
the album. And unlike the 
beginning of the album, the 
song is more grounded, more 
human. “Redeemer” continues 
the momentum of “Woman,” 
still powerful but grittier. It 
feels as if Karen O and Danger 

Mouse 
have 
awoken 
both 
themselves and the listener 
from the distant dreams of the 
opening “Lux Prima.”
The album slowly winds 
down 
from 
its 
climax 
of 
“Woman” 
and 
“Redeemer,” 
symbolic of how the story 
woven together by Karen O and 
Danger House is slowly coming 
to an end. “Leopard’s Tongue” 
is notable for the subtle, exotic 
tone of the bass beat (vaguely 
reminiscent of Mayssa Karaa’s 
“White 
Rabbit”). 
“Nox 
Lumina” rounds out the album 
as an appropriate end to this 
refreshingly 
unusual 
story. 
Starting soft and then growing 
fuller, the ending track is 
noticeably more somber, and 
just a touch ominous.
Karen O and Danger Mouse’s 
album collaboration is fantastic 
not because the songs are 
engaging (which they are) or for 
good lyrics (all together 
haunting, 
energetic 
and 
hypnotizing), 
but 
because 
the 
album 
seemingly 
breaks 
all 
the 
rules. 
Together, 
these two artists found 
a way to find some much 
desired 
originality 
without 
compromising 
their 
authenticity. 
Together, Karen O and 
Danger Mouse created 
something 
new, 
beautiful 
and unexpected. The non-
traditional structure of tracks 
like “Lux Prima” and “Nox 
Lumina” keeps the listener 
on their toes, eradicating the 
boredom accompanied by the 
lackluster effect of drawn-out 
albums. Meanwhile the story-
arc design of the album keeps 
the music grounded amidst 
the rabbit-hole of Karen O’s 
enchanting 
vocals. 
Simply 
put, Lux Prima is invigorating 
for those weary of all things 
cookie-cutter.

Karen O/Danger Mouse 
collab is fresh, invigorating

In South Africa, french fries 
are called hot chips.
Of all the incredible lessons 
I learned in my 12 days on a 
theatre culture exchange in 
Johannesburg, 
South 
Africa, 
one of the most interesting and 
lasting is rooted in a common 
South African culinary staple — 
hot chips. When I look back on 
the past two weeks, when the 
world took my life as its own and 
completely spun it around and 
around, shaking my perspective, 
I reflect on the people I met 
who took part in sharing their 
stories with me. On the way 
home during my final moments 
in the continent, I had a lasting 
connection with a stranger about 
hot chips that really widened 
my perception of South African 
culture even further. Maybe 
the lesson I learned about the 
name we give fried potatoes was 
about more than just potatoes. 
Maybe it was about subliminal 
differences embedded in our 
striking similarities. Maybe it 
was about the universality of 
humanity that I’d found and 
recognized in so many people, 
in so many moments, in so many 
cracks in the surface of such an 
incredible country. 
The first time I came in 
contact with hot chips was when 
I ordered dinner on our very first 
night in Johannesburg, jetlagged 
and under the warm African 
sun. The waiter asked me if I 
wanted a side of hot chips or 
mieliepap, which is commonly 
known as “pap.” Mieliepap, I 
learned, is a type of cornmeal 
porridge typically served as a 
side dish to meats and curries, 
and, to my excitement, is gluten 
free. However, on our first night, 
before I got to know the culture a 
bit more, I took the safe route and 
opted for hot chips, picturing a 
plate piled high with warmed up 
Lay’s potato chips. As you can 
probably assume, my expectation 
for warm Lay’s chips was not met 
when my meal was served. Let’s 
blame my misconception on 
exhaustion.
It hit me when my meal was 
set in front of me that a mix of 
ignorance and my American 
identity fueled the image I 
created of hot chips in my mind. 

Hot chips in South Africa are 
essentially the equivalent of 
American french fries. However, 
many differences are hidden 
below the surface. Not only was 
this my first meal in Africa, it 
was also my first realization 
that I was across the world, 
in a country where culture, 
colloquialisms and social cues 
would be completely different 
from those of America. 
The name “chips” makes sense 
historically because South Africa 
was colonized by British rule in 
the 1800s, and the British refer to 
french fries as “chips” and potato 
chips as “crisps.” The food in 
South Africa is an amalgamation 
of flavors that emerged from 
waves 
of 
colonization 
and 
immigration from folks of Dutch, 
Italian, Greek and British origin 
in the 1800s. Much of the food 
additionally 
has 
Indonesian, 
Portuguese 
and 
Mozambican 
influence, 
and 
the 
culinary 
scene has developed into a 
melting pot of different cultures 
and traditions. Some popular 
ingredients and dishes include 
chicken wings and fried chicken, 
seasoned with piri piri sauce, 
malva pudding (a sweet spongy 
apricot pudding), ostrich pate 
(which I was not adventurous 
enough to try), pumpkin fritters 
and fish and chips. Fish and chips 
is a widely popular dish in South 
Africa and all over the United 
Kingdom. Nomenclature aside, 
chips and french fries are the 
same thing, right? If you’d told 
me before ordering, I would’ve 
thought 
that 
the 
gloriously 
golden, unhealthy slices of fried 
potato can’t vary too much from 
place to place. This is not unlike 
how I never realized that much 
of our American culture would 
be vastly incongruent with South 
African culture, despite the fact 
that we have commonalities 
through the English language. It 
took traveling all the way across 
the world to come face to face 
with a realization that, while I 
think I may understand another 
country, I can never truly know a 
reality until I meet it face to face.
In South Africa, hot chips can 
be compared to American steak 
fries — a thicker cut potato with 
a lighter fry and a center that 
tastes more like a baked potato 
than a french fry. Still, they can’t 
fully be compared to American 
steak 
fries, 
due 
to 
unique 

seasoning, how they’re served 
and how often you can find 
them. First and foremost, hot or 
“slap” chips (the Afrikaans name 
for french fries) are normally 
covered in salt and vinegar, or 
a dusting of cajun seasoning. 
Rarely are they found without 
some sort of added flavor. They’re 
much larger and softer than the 
french fries we’re used to in the 
United States, fried lightly with 
a fresher taste. Hot chips can 
accompany nearly every entree 
and are found on every menu I 
encountered throughout my time 
in South Africa.
A scenario that sticks out 
prominently 
when 
thinking 
about hot chips is a fiasco I 
experienced 
in 
McDonald’s. 
In South Africa, McDonald’s 
includes 
not 
only 
a 
vegan 
menu, veggie burgers and lime 
chocolate milkshakes, but also 
hot chips. I began to realize no 
menu in South Africa was quite 
complete without the staple 
“hot chips” listed under side 
dishes. On the menu, our favorite 
American fried delicacy is still 
labeled “french fries,” but to my 
shock, they actually taste like 
potatoes. I can’t put a finger on 
what 
American 
McDonald’s 
fries taste like, but in South 
Africa, something about them 
tastes … better. McDonald’s is 
generally known for its salty, 
thin, crispy french fries, hidden 
in the bottom of a white paper 
bag. However, in South Africa, 
this beloved side dish is thicker 
and slightly softer, and its flavor 
replicates the starchy vegetable 
from which it originates.
I spent many of my meals eating 
piri piri chicken wings and hot 
chips because, as a tourist who’d 
never been to Johannesburg, I 
was told to steer clear from any 
fresh vegetables and fruits that 
had been washed in water that 
could potentially not agree with 
my stomach. For a foodie who’d 
been ultimately thrilled at the 
prospect of trying new cuisine in 
South Africa, I was discouraged 
by the many internet articles 
and other tourists who advised 
me to be careful about what I 
was eating to avoid spending my 
week depressed and alone on the 
hotel toilet.

The rage of gamers is a force 
powerful enough to plummet 
sales, topple studio executives and 
make some game publishers file for 
bankruptcy. So, when “Anthem,” 
an experience hyped up to be so 
good it would pacify the screams 
of every dissatisfied gamer, 
actually turned out to be 
trash, anger ignited like 
never before. The failure of 
“Anthem” is the most recent 
instance in a long history 
of studios promising an 
experience that their game 
doesn’t deliver on.
To 
provide 
some 
background, “Anthem” is an 
online shooter-looter where 
the player inhabits an Iron 
Man-like mechanical suit 
on a distant planet populated by 
aliens and monsters. The game 
was developed by Bioware and 
published by Electronic Arts. 
The truth is there are redeeming 
qualities to “Anthem”: The combat 
is engaging, the graphics are 
polished and the flight mechanics 
are responsive. However, when 
you’re a studio like Bioware whose 
past projects include Game of 
The Year winning franchises like 
“Mass Effect,” you are held to a 
different standard. Like many 
great studios, Bioware succumbed 
to its hubris and expected gamers 
to swallow any explosion heavy 
sci-fi experience they could scrape 
up. Despite this, the failure of 
“Anthem” is not entirely Bioware’s 
fault. There is plenty of blame 
to go around, and while some 

can be placed on the forces that 
were out of the studio’s control, 
some can also be pointed at bad 
experimentation by Bioware.
It should not be forgotten 
that “Anthem” was published by 
Electronic Arts. The video game 
colossus dominates the market 
and, therefore, has a powerful 
hand in dictating what its studios 
can and cannot do. It’s no secret 

that Electronic Arts tries to 
squeeze profit out of every pixel in 
their games. Yet, in “Anthem,” this 
corporate greed translates into 
painfully annoying gameplay that 
frankly pisses people off. Not only 
are players constantly prompted 
to 
engage 
with 
“Anthem”’s 
microtransaction system (in-game 
purchases with real money), but 
the game feels like its purposely 
crafted to hold back content so 
the player either comes back at a 
later date or buys their fun with 
real money. If you take a look at 
pre-release footage of “Anthem,” 
the world looks vibrant, populated 
and dynamic. Once players got 
their hands on the actual game, 
it becomes very clear that the 
pitch that was sold to them was 
a lie, and most of the content was 

withheld by Electronic Arts for 
monetization. It can never be 
known how much Electronic Arts 
had its fingers in the development 
of “Anthem,” however, it does give 
Bioware a little bit of absolution 
since Electronic Arts tends to ruin 
any games it senses could maybe 
become a cash cow.
Though Electronic Arts did 
have significant influence in the 
making of “Anthem,” at 
the end of the day, it was 
still Bioware’s game. In my 
opinion, Bioware tried to 
experiment with features 
that just aren’t their specialty 
and paid a steep price for 
it. Past projects like “Mass 
Effect” and “Dragon Age” 
have always had an emphasis 
on narrative, branching story 
arcs and multidimensional 
characters in addition to 
fun gameplay mechanics. 
In “Anthem,” the story takes a 
backseat and puts multiplayer front 
and center. Bioware has never been 
known for it’s multiplayer and as a 
result, “Anthem” suffers for it. This 
isn’t to say multiplayer is a bad 
function to implement, but when 
you have a massive world and lots 
of emphasis on lore without a story 
to back it up, everything just seems 
flat. Accordingly, players are much 
less likely to stay, which in turn 
keeps multiplayer lobbies empty 
and renders the whole system 
useless.
The failure of “Anthem” is 
probably not the end of Bioware, 
but it’s definitely a wake-up call. 
Unfortunately, 
Electronic 
Arts 
will still be the money machine, 
and “Anthem” will barely affect its 
profits.

The London Philharmonia’s 
performance for the University 
Musical 
Society 
in 
Hill 
Auditorium this past Thursday 
was a tour de force in late-19th-
century 
German 
orchestral 
music. After a Tuesday night 
performance 
of 
conductor 
Esa-Pekka 
Salonen’s 
“Cello 
Concerto” 
and 
Stravinsky’s 
complete ballet version of “The 
Firebird,” the orchestra settled 
on two staples of the repertoire: 
Schoenberg’s “Verklärte Nacht” 
(“Transfigured 
Night”) 
and 
Bruckner’s “Symphony No. 7 in 
E Major.”
Few orchestras possess the 
broad dynamic range of the 
London Philharmonia. At the 
beginning of the “Verklärte 
Nacht,” the quiet end of the 
strings that were on display 
— the first few notes were just 
barely audible, seeming to grow 
out of the hushed, expectant 
silence that enveloped the hall. 
(“Verklärte Nacht” is written 
for string orchestra.)
From this quiet beginning, 
the piece quickly blossomed 
into an active, highly complex 
texture. Fragmented melodic 
lines in various keys were 
passed around the orchestra. At 
one point, a solo line was passed 
from the concertmaster to the 
principal second, then to the 

principal viola and finally the 
principal cello. Had I closed my 
eyes, I would have no idea that 
the line was moving between 
instruments — the line moved 
seamlessly 
and 
effortlessly 
between instrumentalists.
One 
common 
pitfall 
in 
performances 
of 
“Verklärte 
Nacht” is the dissonance of the 
harmony, as it sometimes begins 
to overpower the searching, 
complex melodic textures that 
lie hidden under the surface. Yet 
at no point in this performance 
did I begin to feel as though the 
piece was losing momentum. 
Salonen managed to keep the 
orchestra’s 
intensity 
intact, 
preserving a gradual crescendo 
over nearly 20 minutes of music, 
even as minor, local zeniths 
came and went.
Towards the end of the 
piece, Schoenberg returns to 
the tonal harmonies of his 
immediate 
predecessors 
and 
tonal contemporaries. Salonen 
chose to emphasize this return 
to tonality by slowing the tempo 
slightly, relaxing for a brief 
moment in unexpected triadic 
harmonies.
While I have listened to 
this piece many times before, 
this was a fresh take that I 
found interesting and oddly 
compelling, 
particularly 
given the Bruckner piece that 
followed. Though Schoenberg 
is normally viewed as a highly 
innovative 
serialist 
figure, 

this performance made his 
music seem almost derivative 
in regards to that of Mahler, 
Bruckner, Wagner and other 
late-19th-century 
German 
composers. The opening of the 
piece had been highly dissonant; 
the ending was arresting and 
beautiful.
After the intermission, the 
strings returned to the stage 
with 
the 
percussion, 
brass 
and woodwind sections for 
Bruckner’s “Symphony No. 7 
in E Major.” After the timbral 
simplicity of the first piece, the 
addition of these sections was a 
little overwhelming — I found 
myself reacting in shock to the 
volume and power of the first 
chord, goosebumps forming in 
reaction to an otherwise simple 
beginning.
This 
symphony, 
perhaps 
Bruckner’s 
most 
famous 
and 
successful 
orchestral 
work, is known for its lower 
brass parts, particularly the 
four Wagner tubas that he 
features prominently in the 
second movement. And in this 
performance, 
the 
orchestra 
did not disappoint. After a 
moving yet more restrained 
first 
movement, 
the 
lower 
brass upped the ante in their 
confident, 
commanding 
opening.

Seventy-nine 
days 
after 
watching 
the 
thorough 
dismantlement of his team in the 
Peach Bowl against Florida — 
anchored by a listless offensive 
performance — Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh finally addressed 
the elephant in the metaphorical 
room 
of 
the 
offseason: 
the 
hiring of Josh Gattis as offensive 
coordinator.
And in doing so, Harbaugh 
offered resounding answers on 
the defining questions facing the 
program.
“He’s 
going 
to 
coordinate 
the offense and call the plays,” 
Harbaugh said, uttering 10 simple 
words that will read more like 
beautiful hymns to some fans.
Gattis was hired to run the 
offense after spending a year as the 
co-offensive coordinator and wide 
receivers coach at Alabama. Prior 
to that, Gattis spent four seasons at 
Penn State, two at Vanderbilt and 
one at both North Carolina and 
Western Michigan. It was during 
Gattis’ tenure in Kalamazoo — just 
over 100 miles west of Ann Arbor 
— that Harbaugh first heard about 
Gattis and his offensive prowess.
“The first time (I heard about 
Gattis) was … I heard from 
somebody or (former Western 
Michigan coach) Bill Cubit told 
me, when Josh was at Western 
Michigan. He had been there a 
month,” Harbaugh recalled. “Bill 
Cubit was introducing him to his 
son, or somebody, and said ‘Son, 
this is Coach Josh Gattis. Talk 
to him, get to know him, he’s not 
going to be around here very long.’ 
“The players he’s developed at 
each stop from there — Western 
Michigan, Vanderbilt, Penn State, 
Alabama — is eye-catching.”
And the list is long. From 
Dae’Sean Hamilton to Jordan 
Matthews to Jordan White — 
an 
All-American 
at 
Western 
Michigan in 2011 — to Jerry Jeudy, 
and plenty in between, Gattis has 

shown a demonstrated ability 
to develop wide receivers. That 
should provide a boon to Donovan 
Peoples-Jones, Tarik Black and 
Nico Collins — arguably the most 
talented trio of receivers in the Big 
Ten. Now, Harbaugh and Michigan 
are making a sizeable investment 
in Gattis’ ability to translate those 
skills to an entire offense.
His hiring comes with the 
clear subtext of a sea change in 
Harbaugh’s tenure at Michigan. 
Gattis, touting his mantra “Speed 
In Space” at every turn, brings 
apparent philosophical differences 
to Harbaugh’s traditional West 
Coach style. While it remains to 
be seen how profoundly different 
the offense will look next season, 
it’s no small matter that Harbaugh 
appears willing to cede the keys.
“I think the biggest difference 
that people will see will be the 
tempo,” Harbaugh said. “The 
tempo is more up-tempo, less 
huddle. That’ll be number one.”
Though tempo is inherently 
difficult to measure, Michigan 
averaged 
the 
18th 
fewest 
possessions in 2018 at 12.25 per 
game. This, critics would argue, 
stems from an offense that was 
frequently 
too 
conservative 
with its abundance of weapons 
— an offense that was tied with 
Vanderbilt for 30th in the nation in 
yards per play, at 5.9. 
But it seems Gattis will prioritize 
aggression from the jump.
“It’s got more of an attacking 
feel to the offense in terms of 
tempo, in terms of going downfield 
in the passing game and some 
other things, different personnel 
groups,” Harbaugh said. “It has 
that same feel that we’ve always 
done — multiple personnel groups, 
you know you’re attacking in that 
way.”
There’s an extent to which 
words will remain inherently 
hollow until next September. There 
are crumbs of evidence to suggest 
there is, indeed, substance behind 
the talk. For one, Harbaugh — a 
staunch advocate for the fullback 

— admitted the position “will be 
used in short yardage and goal 
line situations, predominantly,” 
a potential sign of transition 
toward more spread looks. Former 
quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 
intoned at Pro Day on Friday that, 
based on conversations he had with 
people around the program, the 
offense was shifting closer to the 
spread style Speight ran at UCLA 
under Chip Kelly.
“I actually think, after talking 
to people around here, they’re kind 
of moving in that direction, with 
Coach Gattis,” Speight said. “I can’t 
wait to watch that.” 
The Wolverines return four 
starters along the offensive line, 
quarterback Shea Patterson and an 
array of talented weapons around 
them. Black, Collins and Peoples-
Jones, notably, could parlay big 
seasons into NFL contracts a year 
from now. In all, Michigan boasts 
perhaps the highest offensive 
potential in several years.
If that potential reaches fruition, 
the hire of Josh Gattis could be 
seen down the road as a pivot point 
in the Harbaugh era.
“We’re all working together,” 
Harbaugh said. “… He’s really 
good.”

Coming off perhaps the most 
efficient season from a Michigan 
quarterback in over a decade — 
one in which he posted 2,600 
yards passing, 22 touchdowns 
and 8.0 yards per attempt — Shea 
Patterson will return for his senior 
season as the presumptive starter. 
Any development to the contrary 
would be downright stunning.
And yet, don’t expect any such 
declaration from Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh any time soon. 
“Right 
now, 
Shea, 
Dylan 
(McCaffery), Joe (Milton) are all 
getting equal reps, and they’re 
all 
looking 
good,” 
Harbaugh 
said, diplomatically. “It’s a really 
good, talented quarterback room. 
Brandon Peters, Cade McNamara 
getting in the mix. Mike Sessa is 
doing a really good job.”
Still short of breaking from 
his core tenant of incessant 
competition, Harbaugh offered 
rare insight into the quarterback 
depth chart as it stands today.
“Depth chart: Shea is No. 
1, Dylan’s No. 2, Joe’s No. 3,” 
Harbaugh said, “and there’s no 
possible 
way 
Shea 
Patterson 

will be able to put his feet up, in 
my opinion. They’ve got serious 
competition there with Dylan and 
Joe right now.”
“We’re not going to send each 
other Christmas cards”
Harbaugh’s media availability 
Monday also provided his first 
chance to publicly express his 
sentiment toward the surprising 
departure of defensive line coach 
Greg Mattison to rival Ohio 
State. The 69-year-old Mattison 
joined the staff of new Ohio State 
coach Ryan Day as the Buckeyes’ 
new defensive coordinator after 
spending nine seasons on staff at 
Michigan. 
Still cordial, Harbaugh didn’t 
hide his personal displeasure with 
the move.
“I wouldn’t say shocked — I was 
surprised, yeah. But he wanted to 
be a coordinator again. They darn 
near doubled his salary. I’m not 
going to hold that against him,” 
Harbaugh said. “We’re not going 
to send each other Christmas 
cards, based on where he went, but 
that’s how I feel and understand 
it.”
Mattison and linebackers coach 
Al Washington both bolted for 
Columbus in early January, each 

leaving behind sizeable holes to fill 
on the defensive staff. In his time 
at Michigan, Mattison regularly 
produced 
high-caliber 
college 
players and NFL prospects. The 
list of elite players he’s developed 
includes five first- or second-team 
All-Big Ten selections along the 
defensive line, in Taco Charlton, 
Rashan Gary, Maurice Hurst, 
Chase 
Winovich 
and 
Chris 
Wormley. Shaun Nua and Anthony 
Campanile were hired as the 
defensive line and linebackers’ 
coaches, respectively, shortly after 
their departures. Washington’s 
departure 
will 
be 
felt 
most 
strongly on the recruiting trail, 
where Harbaugh credited him 
with making a serious impact in 
his year with the program.
Still, it’s Mattison’s move that 
will sting most, both for on and off-
field reasons. With Mattison gone, 
Jay Harbaugh is now the only 
coach to be on staff for the entirety 
of Harbaugh’s tenure at Michigan.
“Still a good man,” Harbaugh 
said. “Still a ton of respect for him. 
We’ll be friends again some day, 
when we’re both done coaching.”
New players in new spots
Among the array of changes for 
Michigan this spring, there will be 
some new faces in new places on 
the field. 
Harbaugh ran down a list of 
players trying out new positions 
in spring camp, including players 
operating at multiple positions.
Freshman Ben VanSumeran 
will transition from fullback to 
running back and linebacker, 
perpetuating 
the 
notion 
that 
the old-school fullback position 
will be de-emphasized with new 
offensive coordinator Josh Gattis 
calling plays. Freshman Hassan 
Haskins, who operated at both 
running back and VIPER this 
past season, will focus strictly at 
running back.

Beaubien becoming reliable reliever

About a month ago, Meghan 
Beaubien looked more out of 
character 
than 
ever 
before. 
In Michigan’s ACC/Big Ten 
Challenge 
matchup 
against 
North Carolina on Feb. 15, the 
sophomore left-hander took the 
circle during the bottom of the 
fifth.
With the score tied 3-3, 
Beaubien collapsed, giving up 
three hits, two walks and five 
earned runs. Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins pulled her out in 
the same inning but the damage 
had already been done. The 
Wolverines proceeded to lose, 
8-3.
“My 
biggest 
takeaway 
is 
definitely to let go of the results 
and the outcome and just focus 
on the process, just relaxing and 
playing our game,” Beaubien said 
two days after that performance.
Exactly 
one 
week 
later, 
Michigan trailed 2-1 against 
a formidable Stanford team. 
During 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
sixth, Hutchins wanted to give 
the Cardinal a different look, 
substituting 
freshman 
right-
hander Alex Storako out for the 
opposite-handed Beaubien.
The result: two hits, two 
walks, four earned runs, five 
batters faced in .1 innings 

pitched.
However, 
when 
Beaubien 
started, it was much of the 
opposite. In her 12 starts so far, 
she has allowed more than two 
runs only twice.
Though Beaubien claimed that 
these multi-run innings were a 
result of mentally struggling in 
the circle, Hutchins thought it 
to be an issue with the speeds of 
her different pitches.
“We need to have a better 
off-speed 
pitch 
right 
now,” 
Hutchins said on Mar. 9. “That’s 
because when you’re a pitcher 
of (Beaubien’s) caliber, that’s a 
pitch that can really make you 
great. It’s been a pitch that’s 
been great for her. It’s been 
inconsistent this season.”
In the final non-conference 
series of the season against 
Kent State this past weekend, 
Beaubien 
had 
phenomenal 
outings as the starting pitcher 
for the first two games, allowing 
four hits without a walk or 
earned run in eight total innings.
But 
Beaubien’s 
biggest 
challenge 
of 
the 
weekend 
came toward the tail end of the 
weekend.
Holding a 3-1 lead in the top 
of the sixth during Sunday’s 
second game, Storako began to 
struggle. With two outs and two 
runners on base, she hit a batter 
which ended her night.

Hutchins, rather than turning 
to a fresher pitcher in sophomore 
right-hander 
Sarah 
Schaefer, 
turned to Beaubien with the 
bases loaded, trusting her to 
finish off the inning without 
letting the Golden Flashes inch 
back.
Beaubien 
attacked 
Kent 
State’s 
Brenna 
Brownfield, 
striking her out as she watched 
the ball hit senior catcher Katie 
Alexander’s glove – exactly what 
Hutchins had been asking for 
the entire season – ending the 
inning.
In the seventh, Beaubien 
forced a fly out while striking out 
Megan Turner and Kristyn Eckl 
with a mix of fastballs and off-
speed pitches, earning her first 
save of her sophomore campaign 
and helping complete a sweep of 
the Golden Flashes.
Now, after three consecutive 
performances without giving up 
an earned run as a relief pitcher, 
including one against then-No. 
9 Louisiana State, Beaubien 
is scorching. She’s found her 
swagger as a starter. But most of 
all, she’s started to mold into a 
reliable reliever as well.
And if the Wolverines have 
any plans for a conference 
championship, the pitchers will 
have to continue to attack and 
Beaubien knows well that she’ll 
be leading the pack.

‘M’ wears mustaches for a cause

In Michigan’s dominant home-
opening series against Manhattan 
College, it might have been easy 
to miss the many Wolverines now 
donning mustaches.
It wasn’t just a way for players 
to stay warm after returning 
to Ann Arbor from their two 
sunny series in California and 
Florida. Michigan is taking part 
in “mustache March,” a campaign 
against 
amyotrophic 
lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou 
Gehrig’s Disease.
The Wolverines are joining East 
Carolina and Memphis in growing 
out their mutsaches over the 
month to encourage donations to 
the ALS Association’s “Strike Out 
Lou Gehrig’s Disease” campaign.
This is Michigan’s first year 
taking part in the campaign, 
which originated at East Carolina 
four years ago. Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich has ties to East 
Carolina from both his playing 
and coaching career, which helped 
the mustache-growing effort take 
root in Ann Arbor. 
East Carolina coach Clifford 
Godwin, who enlisted Bakich 
in the ALS campaign, looks 
back fondly on their years spent 
together playing in Greenville, 
North Carolina 

“He is one of my best friends,” 
Godwin said. “Meeting him back 
in the fall of 1998, Erik a California 
kid and me an Eastern North 
Carolina kid – what people would 
probably consider a ‘country boy’ 
– at first we were just trying to feel 
each other out and see how those 
worlds mixed.
“At the end of the day, no matter 
what our different backgrounds 
were, we all loved one another 
because we just wanted to make 
EC baseball better.”
And that they did. Bakich 
and Godwin, along with current 
Michigan assistant coach Nick 
Schnabel, helped the Pirates 
win 
back-to-back 
conference 
championships in the 1999 and 
2000 seasons and earn No. 1 seeds 
in NCAA Regionals both years. 
The two reunited at Vanderbilt 
in 2004-05 as Godwin served as 
Director of Baseball Operations 
while Bakich was an assistant 
coach for the Commodores.
ALS is a meaningful cause in 
any case, but it carries personal 
significance 
for 
Bakich 
and 
Godwin. In their two seasons 
together as Pirates, the two 
coaches 
played 
under 
Keith 
LeClair, who was diagnosed with 
ALS in 2001 and later succumbed 
to 
the 
disease. 
Memphis, 
meanwhile, is taking part because 
the father of a player passed away 

from the disease last year. 
“When our second baseman 
at the time proposed having a 
mustache March, I told him, ‘No 
way unless it’s for a great cause,’ 
” Godwin said. “So, when he 
came into my office the next day 
proposing we do so in an effort 
to raise money for Lou Gehrig’s 
disease, I was completely on 
board.
“In the offseason I called up 
Erik to get Michigan baseball 
involved since he, Nick Schnabel 
and I played for Keith. Of course, 
he was happy to join. … The 
disease hits home for both of us.”
Last year, ECU and Memphis 
combined to raise over $10,000 
to fight the disease. With the 
Wolverines involved this year, 
that total promises to be even 
higher.
“Our players are not only 
hoping to help raise awareness but 
also put some financial traction 
behind the good cause,” Bakich 
said. “Hopefully we can make a 
nice contribution.”
Beyond that, with the team 
quickly approaching the busiest 
stretch of its season, Bakich is also 
glad to have a source of levity.
“I don’t know how growing 
a mustache got picked,” he said. 
“But in addition to helping a great 
cause, it’s certainly provided a 
little comic relief, too.”

Michigan State sweep fuels Wolverines with tournament approaching

CHICAGO 
— 
Twenty 
minutes after Michigan looked 
on as confetti cannons burst 
and the United Center lit up in 
green and white, celebrating 
Michigan State as the Big Ten 
Tournament champions, the 
Wolverines were ushered to 
their selection show watch 
party.
Suddenly, 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team 
had 
to switch gears to the NCAA 
Tournament. 
Cameras 
were 
trained on the Wolverines, 
ready to catch their reaction 
as their draw — a No. 2 seed 
playing Montana in Des Moines 
— was announced.
The announcement itself was 
anti-climactic. Michigan knew 
it would be in the tournament 
and though the Wolverines 

stood and clapped while they 
were announced, they were 
devoid of the same energy as 
teams with undetermined fates 
— and teams that hadn’t just 
been dealt a crushing loss.
Back in the locker room 
afterwards, the mixed emotions 
collided.
Some 
players 
were 
sullen, 
refusing to even 
face 
reporters. 
The ones that did 
simultaneously 
faced 
questions 
about what had 
gone 
wrong 
in 
Michigan’s third 
loss to its most 
bitter rival and 
questions looking 
ahead to March Madness.
But the answers to those two 
questions are connected.
“Here we are on Sunday and 

we’re down,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “We’re on 
to the NCAA Tournament and 
now we’ll see what we can do 
there and learn from what we 
did today.”
Before blowing their second 
title opportunity in two weeks, 
the 
Wolverines 
blew 
away 
both Iowa and 
Minnesota 
in 
earlier rounds 
of the Big Ten 
Tournament. 
Neither 
of 
those 
teams 
is great — but 
both 
made 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament as 
No. 10 seeds, 
and 
Michigan 
hadn’t beaten a tournament-
caliber team so decisively since 
January.
Ask the players, and they’ll 

tell you that the fact that those 
wins came so soon after the loss 
at the Breslin Center on Mar. 9 — 
which compeleted the regular-
season sweep for the Spartans 
— wasn’t a coincidence.
“The 
loss 
at 
Michigan 
State kinda brought a lot of us 
together and kinda evaluate 
ourselves,” 
said 
sophomore 
forward 
Isaiah 
Livers 
on 
Saturday 
after 
the 
semifinal 
win. “Look in the 
mirror, are you 
doing what’s right 
for us to win? 
What’s 
going 
on? Why are we 
coming up short 
against our rivals?
“It was just, some people just 
self-reflected, some had a little 
meeting. It was just small stuff 

like that and I could see from 
starter all the way to walk-on, 
just a difference in the practices 
last week. It felt a lot more 
competitive and focused.”
The title game made clear 
that those issues aren’t totally 
resolved. But there were some 
improvements, 
tweaks 
that 
came 
out 
against 
lesser 
competition. 
And 
perhaps 
the 
road 
to 
another March 
run is taking 
those 
tweaks 
a step further 
— 
something 
the Wolverines 
have 
no 
shortage 
of 
motivation to do.
“I think every loss has been 
a rallying point for us,” Beilein 
said. “That we learn from every 

loss and we’ll learn from this 
one. … We’d like to avoid losing 
to get better, but the fact of life 
is it’s gonna happen.”
Michigan likely won’t soon 
forget the way it felt in the locker 
room. Even amid the joy of a 
high NCAA Tournament seed 
and the fun of March Madness, 
the pain of the Spartan sweep 
will still be there, fuel for a 
team that still very much has 
something to prove.
Of course, it’s a tough task 
to fix everything so quickly. 
The 
Wolverines 
play 
again 
Thursday, and there’s only so 
much prep that can go into such 
a short turnaround. Beilein 
himself couldn’t offer up any 
promises Sunday, but when 
asked if it was really possible to 
produce an uptick in efficiency 
in a mere matter of days, Beilein 
did offer a glimmer of hope.
“We have before.”

Michigan draws Kansas State in 
first round of NCAA Tournament

The Wolverines are officially 
going dancing.
Nine days after the Michigan 
women’s basketball team bowed 
out of the Big Ten Tournament 
with 
a 
semifinal 
loss 
to 
Maryland, 
the 
Wolverines 
secured 
their 
second-
consecutive NCAA Tournament 
berth.
“You never want to take for 
granted the opportunity to play 
in the NCAA Tournament,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “It’s always a special day. 
It’s like Christmas in March. It’s 
a great honor to be selected. It’s 
great for our seniors but really 
for our younger kids to have this 
experience.”
As the No. 8 seed in the 
Albany Region, Michigan will 
face Kansas State in the Round 
of 64. The two teams will 
meet on Friday in Louisville, 
Kentucky.
The 
Wildcats’ 
season 
followed a similar trajectory 
as the Wolverines’. Not only 
do 
both 
squads 
enter 
the 
tournament with a 21-11 record 
and finished fourth in their 
respective 
conferences, 
but 

Michigan and Kansas State 
both went on late-season runs 
to 
cement 
their 
postseason 
resumés. The Wolverines won 
eight of their last nine to finish 
out the regular season, while the 
Wildcats ended on a five-game 
win streak — punctuated by a 
season sweep of powerhouse 
Texas.
“They had some great wins 
through the course of the year 
and had a really strong finish,” 
Barnes Arico said. “I don’t know 
when the committee was going 
through that if they thought, 
‘These are two teams that 
finished strong, it would be a 
great first round matchup,’ but 
they seem very similar to us.”
Receiving an at-large bid 
was not a surprising outcome 
for Michigan, but the team was 
blindsided by ESPN prematurely 
displaying the bracket three 
hours ahead of schedule.
“Right when practice ended 
we talked at the circle,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I said ‘There’s 
been a leak but there are so 
few surprises in your life, so if 
you guys can wait it will be fun 
to hold out.’ That being said, 
obviously everyone went to 
their phone, so by the time we 
got to our little party, everybody 

already knew.”
If Michigan gets past Kansas 
State, it will likely face No. 1 
seed Louisville. At 29-3 overall, 
the ACC runners-up are one 
of the tournament favorites. 
Adding the Cardinals’ home-
court advantage to the equation 
means the Wolverines would be 
playing the role of underdog in 
that matchup. The teams’ most 
recent meeting — in November 
2017 — ended with a 25-point 
win for Louisville.
Before it can think about a 
potential Sweet Sixteen run 
though, the Wolverines must 
focus on the game at hand. 
Michigan has played its best 
basketball of the season as 
of late, but with almost two 
full weeks between the Big 
Ten Tournament and Friday’s 
game, the team might struggle 
to 
continue 
their 
recent 
momentum.
Nevertheless, the Wolverines 
seem ready for the challenge.
“Our kids really have a belief 
that they can play with anyone,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“When 
you’re going into the NCAA 
Tournament, you kinda have to 
have that belief in yourself and 
your teammates. We’re feeling 
pretty confident right now.”
