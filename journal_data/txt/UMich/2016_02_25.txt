Stratagies and 

long-term solutions 
discussed at Active 

Minds event

By NISA KHAN

For the Daily

About 20 people gathered in 

the Michigan Union Wednesday 
evening to participate in a dialogue 

on eating disorders, hosted by 
campus mental health organization 
Active Mind. The panel is one of six 
events the organization is holding 
in conjunction with Project Heal, 
a nonprofit established to provide 
treatment scholarships for those 
with eating disorders, for National 
Eating Disorder Awareness Week.

During the event, Kate Fawcett, 

a program social worker and 
therapist at the University of 
Michigan Comprehensive Eating 
Disorders Program, stressed the 

importance of interventions. Most 
people who suffer from eating 
disorders will not readily recognize 
or admit the problem, so friends 
who are aware should be ready to 
help, she said.

“The eating disorder comes in 

and eclipses your life,” she said, 
noting that she had battled an 
eating disorder herself for years. 
“Food, eating, exercise, weight, 
body management — the eating 
disorder speaks on your behalf.”

She 
asked 
students 
to 

acknowledge 
and 
respond 
to 

warning signs, such as someone 
becoming more withdrawn, less 
social at events that involve food, 
skipping meals, or engaging in 
unhealthy habits.

“If someone is really in danger, 

you owe it to them to help them get 
some help,” she said.

Student 
organizers 
also 

presented findings from a recent 
U-SHAPE survey, which garnered 
statistics specific to eating disorders

Over past eight 
years, University 
researchers make 
progress in field

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

With 
the 
aim 
of 
treating 

conditions 
such 
as 
diabetes, 

Alzheimer’s 
and 
some 
types 

of cancers, the University of 
Michigan’s stem cell research 
program 
has 
advanced 

exponentially over the past eight 
years, making it a state leader in the 
area.

The 
growth 
follows 
the 

passage of a controversial 2008 
state proposal, Proposal 2, which 
allowed the use of human embryos 
for stem cell research under 
certain conditions. The proposal 
has prompted a huge spike at the 
University in research projects and 
funding for stem cells — an area 
of study that today, researchers 
say, remains with opportunities 
to grow, but also still faces some 

controversy 
on 
campus 
and 

beyond.

What a stem cell does:
To understand what stem cell 

research means for the University, 
it’s first important to understand 
what it is. Stem cells are cells 
that have the capacity to produce 
different kinds of cells in a given 
tissue as well as make copies 
of themselves — making them 
uniquely useful in research.

Ivan 
Maillard, 
associate 

professor of cell and developmental 
biology, is one of several at the 
University who utilizes stem cells 
in research. Maillard’s research 
focuses on blood-forming stem 
cells — cells that create other cells 
in the blood system and allow for 
normal production of blood cells. 
Blood-forming stem cells are adult 
stem cells typically retrieved out of 
individual tissues.

“(Stem cells) have the potential to 

be used themselves as a treatment 
for 
patients,” 
Maillard 
said. 

“The only ones that are actually 
routinely used as a treatment for 
patients are the blood-forming 
stem cells. The other types of stem

LSA junior Maura Drabik 

was walking through Festifall 
during her sophomore year 
when she came across a 
table advertising the Detroit 
Partnership Program. Drabik 
stopped — she had taught a 
religious education class in 
high school and knew she 
wanted to work with children 
in some way. 

The Detroit Partnership is a 

student-run organization that 
aims to foster partnerships 
between the University of 
Michigan and Detroit. Many 
of the program’s volunteers 
are placed in Detroit Public 
Schools’ elementary schools 
to help teachers by grading 
papers, working with students 
and supervising the class. 
Drabik quickly joined the 

organization and was placed 
in 
Bennett 
Elementary 

school, located in southwest 
Detroit. Since then, she has 
been working in a third grade 
classroom.

“A lot of the time I’m just 

there to take the load off (the 
teacher),” she said. “I’ll grade 
papers, I’ll work with them 
on art projects, sometimes 
I’ll help them with their 
individual work.”

Drabik has been paired 

with the same teacher for two 
years and has watched the 
classroom change as the city, 
and the public school system, 
have struggled to cope with 
debt. Detroit Public Schools 
is nearing $3.5 billion in debt, 
according to a report released 
by 
the 
Citizens 
Research 

Council of Michigan early 
January, and many building 
and 
teaching 
conditions 

are falling far below the 
state average. Of the $7,400 
allocated 
per 
student 
per 

year in Detroit, over $1,100 
per student is being spent to 
service debt in the city school 
system rather than heading

CSG aims to launch 
series of events on 
topic for students

By DESIREE CHEW

Daily Staff Reporter

Student financial literacy was 

the focus of a talk sponsored 
by the University of Michigan 
Central 
Student 
Government 

and the Office of Financial Aid 

Wednesday.

LSA sophomore Grant Strobl, 

chair 
for 
CSG 
government 

relations, said the body hoped the 
event would help UM students be 
more financially independent.

“It is our first attempt to have 

a large-scale event,” Strobl said. 
“(It) is part of the CSG initiative to 
bring in the focus on what college 
students hold near and dear, 
and that is the price of college. 
(Financial literacy) is something 
that we might be carrying with us 

some time after we graduate.”

He also noted that the financial 

aid office found many students 
struggled 
with 
debt, 
which 

suggested that financial literacy 
might be something that would 
aid the student body.

“One of the reasons why 

students might have a hard time 
paying back their loans is that they 
don’t know how to manage their 
personal finances,” he said.

Multiple Ann Arbor institutions 

are banding together to bring a 
monorail to the city.

Officials from the city of Ann 

Arbor, the University of Michigan, 
the Ann Arbor Area Transportation 
Authority and the Downtown 
Development Authority gathered 
at the Michigan Union Wednesday 
for a press conference on the 
Ann Arbor Connector, a project 
that has not announced any new 
developments since 2013.

The project is envisioned as a 

light rail transit system that will 
connect students and residents to 
busy city centers. Phase one of the 
Connector is slated to run through 
downtown, Central Campus, North 
Campus and the Medical Center, 
while phase two would focus on

The cold 

temperatures weren’t the 
only thing freezing the 
diag today.

The sixth annual Diag 

Freeze took place today, 
from 11:32 a.m. to 11:37 
a.m.

Participants were 

asked to come to the 
diag and set two alarms 
on their phones, one for 
11:32 and one for 11:37. 
When the first alarm 
buzzes, they must freeze 
like statues in a position 
of their choosing. Then, 
when the second alarm 
buzzes, they are to 
unfreeze and carry on as 
if nothing happened.

This event is put on 

every year by DoRAK 
at the University of 

Michigan. The students 
organizing this event 
hoped that it would be 
bigger and better than in 
years past.

“This year we’re 

looking for more people, 
more creative poses, and 
a great time all around. It 
takes YOU to make this 
the best FREEZE this 
campus, or any campus, 
has ever seen!” reads 
a post on the event’s 
Facebook page.

Colleen Doran, a 

sophomore studying 
dental hygiene, attended 
the Diag Freeze with 
four of her friends. 
She said she admired 
the creativity of the 
event and appreciated 
how different people 

expressed their 
individuality.

“It was cool!” she 

said. “A lot of people had 
good ideas such as the 
light sabers, building a 
snowman, etc. We were 
wishing we got more 
creative. It would’ve been 
nice for a bigger turnout 
but I think the snow may 
have deterred people. 
But students were taking 
videos and smiling which 
is nice especially around 
midterms.”

According to the 

Facebook page, 73 people 
were planning to attend 
the Diag Freeze, with an 
additional 278 interested 
in the event.

into the classroom.

“It’s a really, really tough 

environment,” 
Drabik 
said. 

“Three or four of the students 
in the classroom I work in 
should’ve been held back, but 
they didn’t have the money to 
support that. You come into this 
classroom and there are kids at 
such different levels.”

That disparity in ability, she 

added, is often extreme.

“Some kids can’t even read,” 

she said. “I had one kid that just 
moved from Mexico, should not 
have been in the third grade 
classroom, does not speak a 
word of English.”

Drabik 
said 
her 
school, 

however, 
has 
fared 
well 

compared to others in the area. 
Some schools have reported 
rodents running around the 
classrooms, 
cockroaches, 

ceilings falling down and water 
leakages.

Conditions like those, that 

Drabik and many other involved 
with the school system have 

noted, didn’t form overnight. 
For many, the deterioration 
is largely tied to the district’s 
now-crippling 
accumulation 

of debt, which has resulted in 
a number of efforts to reduce 
costs and boost the struggling 
district over the years.

In 
October 
2015, 
Gov. 

Rick Snyder announced his 
overhaul of DPS. The initiative 
aimed to create a new school 
system, transition the board 
and students to the new school 
district and require the existing 
district to pay off its debt.

The overhaul is estimated 

to cost the state $715 million 
dollars by its completion, or 
about $70 million dollars a year 
for the next 10 years.

Synder’s 
plan 
garnered 

negative reactions from multiple 
units within DPS. Beginning in 
November, seven instructional 
days were cancelled in select 
schools shortly after Snyder’s 
announcement. 
The 
reason: 

too many teachers called in 
sick and refused to come to 
work. These types of protests, 
called a “sickout,” were in 
direct response to the building 

conditions, pay cuts — teachers 
have faced multiple cuts over 
the last five years, including 10 
percent cuts in both 2011 and 
2014 — and Snyder’s plans.

Drabik, who only volunteers 

on 
Friday 
afternoons, 
said 

though none of the sickouts 
were on a Friday, her school, 
Bennett Elementary was one of 
the many schools affected by the 
sickouts. She added that though 
she was not directly impacted by 
the protest, she was saddened by 
the worsening conditions at the 
school.

“It worries me to see these 

teachers 
taking 
sick 
days,” 

Drabik said. “These students 
need to be in school, they need 
to be there.”

On Jan. 19, 2016, following 

the 
most 
recent 
sickouts, 

Snyder called on legislature to 
relieve the school district of 
$515 million of its debt. He said 
by April, DPS was in danger of 
running out of money.

For teachers, students and 

others invested in DPS, the 
problems Snyder has identified 
aren’t new, and stretch back 
much further than that January 
call to action or the sickouts, 
back through the past decades 
of the district’s history.

A teacher working for Detroit 

Public Schools, who requested 
anonymity due to fear of losing 
his job, said the conditions 
within his school have declined 
drastically over the decade he 
has worked for the district. He 
said his school participated in 
one of the district-wide sickouts 
in protest of the pay cuts and 
conditions of other schools.

“We didn’t want to get our 

principal in trouble for having 
a sickout, but we wanted to call 
attention to everything else and 
those people who have these 
chronic problems with lack of 
textbooks, lack of supplies and 
deterioration of buildings,” he 
said.

The teacher said his students 

don’t get a recess during the day 
due to understaffing. Instead, 
they have lunch in the cafeteria 
and have 20 minutes to play in 
the gym.

“Usually it’s chaos because 

you have so many children in 
there and there’s only one or 

two adults so it’s easier for 
them to have the kids sit in lines 
than it is for them to play,” the 
teacher said.

A lack of recess or recreational 

time is not abnormal for DPS 
students. 
According 
to 
the 

teacher, 
students 
are 
often 

given time inside a gym or a 
walk around the building in 
replacement.

He said he loves teaching and 

considers being in the classroom 
a passion of his, but he worries 
for the future of his students and 
others at DPS.

“My fear is that students 

aren’t going to get that good of 
an education,” he said. “My own 
children get a great education 
in another district. The kids in 
Detroit are just as smart, but 
they have a bad (reputation). 
The schools aren’t that great. 
The teachers are good, but they 
don’t have the other stuff. The 
last 10 years I’ve taught, none 
of my children have had art, 
music or gym. The children get 
computers two times a week.”

Overall, the numbers bear 

the teacher’s concern out — 
DPS falls far below national 
averages on many metrics of 
student performance. According 
to the National Assessment of 
Educational Progress, Detroit 
students rank last in all U.S. 
cities. Most notably, only 27 
percent of fourth graders in 
the NEAP were found to be 
proficient in reading and only 36 
percent proficient in math.

The DPS teacher said working 

every day against the harsh 
conditions and seeing numbers 
like that dishearten teachers in 
Detroit.

“It’s hard for Detroit teachers, 

seeing that we tap out our 
salaries at $55,000,” he said. 
“Out of that we have to pay 1.25 
percent to the city of Detroit, we 
have other things that come out. 
A Utica teacher makes almost 
$90,000, a Farmington teacher 
makes $82,000, Walled Lake 
makes $88,000. It’s difficult 
to say that we are so poor 
and Detroit teachers are the 
ones who are bankrupting the 
district, when we make $20,000 
less than suburban schools. 
We constantly see how we’re 
failing.”

At the University, which has 

multiple partnerships, programs 
and 
internships 
in 
Detroit 

for students, some linked to 
teaching, the overall impact of 
the current climate has been 
mixed.

Elizabeth Moje, associate dean 

for research and community 
engagement for the School of 
Education, said the University 
hasn’t 
had 
many 
problems 

with 
the 
sickouts 
affecting 

interns. 
However, 
she 
said 

allowing interns to experience 
these conditions is a learning 
opportunity for students in the 
School of Education.

“It’s 
really 
had 
quite 
a 

minimal direct effect on their 
experience,” Moje said. “We’re 
able to discuss the action both of 
the district and of the teachers as 
a teaching moment. It becomes 
a conversation with our interns 
about both the challenges and 
conditions 
that 
they 
might 

face and the decisions that 
teachers often have to make 
about how they’re going to work 
within those challenges and 
conditions.”

For some students, the impact 

is more personal. LSA junior 
Micah Griggs, who graduated 
from DPS Renaissance High 
School before enrolling at the 
University, said she thought the 
conditions in her old school were 
unacceptable.

“It’s really unfortunate that 

some of the schools have mold 
and a lack of supplies,” Griggs 
said. 
“That’s 
not 
conducive 

to 
learning 
at 
all 
so 
it’s 

unfortunate, students can’t go 
to those schools. Teachers have 
to have a sickout because they’re 
beginning to protest about the 
state. It’s not as if (just) the 
power went out. There’s rodents, 
there’s mold on the walls, there’s 
no heat.”

Griggs said she was fortunate 

to have attended one of DPS’ 
newer schools, so there was 
little decay or deterioration 
at the time. Renaissance High 
School, 
however,closed 
on 

multiple occasions for sickouts 
in January.

“It makes me feel as if the 

students 
are 
abandoned,” 

Griggs said. “I really think that 
education is so important and 

it’s key to a lot of success. It’s just 
being ripped away from them.”

Griggs’s 
siblings 
currently 

attend 
a 
private 
school 
in 

Detroit. Her brother will be 
starting 
Renaissance 
High 

School in the fall, and she said 
she worries about the quality of 
education he could receive.

“I’m concerned about the 

substance of programs for him,” 
Griggs said. “I’m hoping that the 
band, dance and arts aren’t cut. 
Those things are important for a 
holistic education.”

She added that it’s important 

for University students to know 
what is happening in Detroit, 
Ann Arbor’s neighboring city.

“A lot of people don’t know. 

Just being aware that these 
things happen — and they 
happen because we don’t have 
funding and our funding is used 
for other sectors.” She said. 
“This is our neighboring city 30 
minutes away.”

LSA junior Tishanna Taylor, 

a DPS Renaissance High School 
alum, echoed Griggs’ concerns. 
Taylor’s mother was a teacher at 
DPS and moved out of the district 
because of the conditions.

“It’s sad to see that teachers are 

not getting as much recognition 
they deserve,” Taylor said. “They 
do such hard work for those 
who do quality work and they 
care for their students. To not 
get compensated appropriately 
is kind of sad and they resort 
to leaving the district that they 
want to help.”

She said she hopes people 

don’t give up on DPS and the 
many assets and capabilities it 
still has.

“Right now, it just looks 

very bad with the schools and 
sickouts and the showcasing of 
the buildings, things like that,” 
she said. “I guess sometimes 
throughout that, we lose sight of 
what’s important, which is the 
education for the children.”

She said the future of DPS lies 

in the hands of more than just 
the people on top.

“People 
should 
just 
pay 

attention or even try to learn 
more, or watch and see what’s 
happening 
with 
the 
school 

system,” Taylor said. “It’s more 
than just the administration that 
has to be changed.”

Ann Arbor to the Ross Athletic 
Campus and Briarwood area.

The 
project 
will 
cost 

approximately 
$500 
million 

to $700 million, and add an 
additional 8 percent increase in 
annual operating costs system-
wide — to both the Ann Arbor area 
transit system and the University. 
The exact breakdown of funding 
and sources has not yet been 
determined. 
However, 
similar 

projects in the past have seen a 
combination of federal, state and 
University funding along with 
public and private partnerships.

Currently, 
the 
University 

transportation system and the 
AAATA serve over 30,000 daily 
passengers. 
Compared 
to 
a 

standard bus, the Connector is 
estimated to run about 43 percent 
faster and increase capacity by 
approximately 52 percent.

During 
Wednesday’s 
press 

conference, 
Steve 
Dolen, 

University 
executive 
director 

of parking and transportation 
services, highlighted the impact 
of forecasted growth in ridership 
in the community. The current 
high levels of demand means 
the established transportation is 
already operating at full capacity, 
he said.

“Our 
current 
systems 
are 

stressed to meet that demand 
efficiently, 
reliably 
and 

conveniently,” Dolen said. “This 
advanced system will not only help 
us with today’s capacity issues, but 
it also sets us up for the future.”

Officials also stressed several 

other expected benefits of the 
proposal, saying riders can expect 
greater travel time reliability 
because the Connector will not 
be at the mercy of traffic, instead 
benefiting from a dedicated lane. 
Additionally, the project hopes to 
use 100 percent alternative and 
renewable energy, largely focusing 
on local sources of hydroelectric 
power.

The project is still in the 

early planning stages, and the 
implementation 
process 
could 

take anywhere from six to 12 
years according to a press release. 
Planners described the project 
as being in a phase of exploring 
alternative 
transportation 

strategies. Once the project clears 
that phase and is approved, it 
will then begin with a 24-month 
environmental 
review 
and 

preliminary engineering phase, 
followed by the final design stage. 
The construction and testing will 
take about an additional 24 to 36 
months.

According 
to 
Dolen, 
the 

University is slated to play a large 
role in the implementation and 
funding of the environmental 
review phase. The current phase 
is being led by the AAATA.

“The intention is that the 

University will lead the next phase 
of the project, but it’s still the same 
collaborative effort that we’ve had 
going forward,” he said.

In 2011, the University and the 

city collaborated with AAATA 
and the AADA to fund a study 
investigating the feasibility of 
such a transit system. Eli Cooper, 
city 
transportation 
program 

manager, said Wednesday that 
the 
study 
explored 
various 

available technologies, travel 
patterns 
and 
community 

growth, but it did not delve into 
the more logistical details, such 
as location or technology, which 
is what planners are currently 
exploring.

He said once the city realized 

the system was a feasible concept, 
it was no longer just a vision. 
The Ride then took over for the 
alternative analysis stage because 
a transportation agency was best 
suited to lead this phase.

“This is nearing the level of 

the initial vision statement in the 
context of there is and should be a 
level of excitement and enthusiasm 
that this vision is becoming more 
real on a day-to-day basis,” Cooper 
said. “This is a moment in time to 
reflect on advancing through the 
alternatives analysis and having 
a recommendation to carry and 
allow us to move forward.”

Alternatives 
analysis 
study 

are 
considered 
best 
practice 

by 
the 
U.S. 
Department 
of 

Transportation. Matt Carpenter, 
CEO of The Ride, said the study is 
the entryway for federal funding 
and requires the evaluation of the 
technical merits associated with 
different routes. In this case, the 
light rail option has been deemed 
the most cost effective.

“The 
alternatives 
analysis 

confirms the win-win opportunity 
for a study like this to create an 
asset that can be used by everyone 
and anyone in the community,” 
Carpenter said. “That helps us 
accommodate the growing interest 
in this growing community and 
provides a faster, more reliable 
and more comfortable means of 
travel.”

Dolen 
noted 
that 
because 

Connector 
ridership 
numbers 

are largely driven by University 
activity related to health care, 
employment, academics, research 
and visitors, the project should be 
well poised to compete for federal 
funds.

Before 
the 
lengthy 

implementation process can begin, 
the proposal must be approved. 
In the meantime, the long-term 
project is seeking public support 
and opinions.

On 
March 
24, 
a 
public 

engagement event will take place 
at the Ann Arbor District Library 
or Detroit Public Library Main 
Branch from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 
another from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the 
Traverwood Branch.

University planner Sue Gott 

said the goal is to gather feedback 
and ideas from the public about 
some of the more specific details 
associated with the plan.

“Part of what we hope the 

community 
input 
will 
help 

contribute both in terms of the 
refinement of the alignment and 
also the design of the product 
that’s used,” Gott said. “It’s 
important that we remain open-
minded about the possibilities 
so that as we continue to move 
forward, we’re very inclusive of 
good ideas, of the most advanced 
technology.”

TRANSIT

cells have the potential to be useful 
in other conditions, especially 
conditions where the organs 
become damaged by disease or 
other conditions and ideally, you 
would need to replace the cells in 
the damaged organ by new cells. 
You can consider using stem cells 
as a way to do that in the future.”

Along with helping develop 

treatments, stem cells have also 
been used to provide information 
about human biology and replace 
cells in a damaged organ.

There are several different 

types of stem cells —adult stem 
cells are found in individual 
tissues as stem cells that have 
already chosen which type of cell 
to become. Embryonic stem cells, 
on the other hand, are found in 
the embryo only at early stages, 
when the embryo consists of just 
a few cells. Usually, to be used for 
research, embryonic stem cells 
are kept at this young state to 
prevent them from growing into 
adult cells, according to MStem 
Laboratories, the center for stem 
cell research at the University.

Gary Smith, the director of the 

MStem Cell Laboratories, said his 
lab primarily focuses on making 
human embryonic stem cells for 
single-gene disorders, such as 
muscular dystrophy.

“What we do is make the 

embryonic stem cell line from the 
embryo, grow it, characterize it, 
and then with documentation, 
we submit them to the National 
Institute 
of 
Health,” 
Smith 

said. “They review all of the 
documentation and then accept 
them — every line we’ve made has 
been accepted on the NIH registry 
… any researcher in the country 
can get the stem cell lines from the 
University of Michigan and work 
on them with federal funds.”

The cells are typically derived 

from fertilized embryos of couples 
who created them for reproductive 
purposes yet no longer need them. 
The embryos are either discarded 
as medical waste or donated with 
consent for research needs.

Maillard said the potential 

to help the patients he interacts 
with on a daily basis motivates his 
research, which often uses stem 
cells for bone marrow transplants 
as an effective treatment in many 
cases.

“I work with these patients,” 

Maillard said. “I see them in the 
clinic and I see their problems. I 

see the ones that we can help, and I 
also see the limitations of the field. 
I see the patients that we are not 
able to help enough and I want to 
be part of the solutions that we’re 
going to bring to these patients.”

State proposal on stem cell 

research

The 
Michigan 
Stem 
Cell 

Amendment, 
more 
commonly 

known as Proposal 2, was passed 
by the state’s electorate in 2008. It 
expanded use of human embryos 
in research so long as the embryos 
were created for the purposes of 
conceiving children and were not 
suitable for implantation or would 
be otherwise discarded unless 
used for research. The proposal 
also required that donations were 
made from consenting couples 
who 
voluntarily 
sought 
out 

fertility treatment.

Following 
the 
passage 
of 

this legislation, the University 
announced the opening of the 
A. 
Alfred 
Taubman 
Medical 

Research Institute Consortium for 
Stem Cell Therapies in 2009. The 
institute was intended to facilitate 
the development of new stem cell 
lines. At the same time, President 
Barack Obama issued an executive 
order lifting restrictions placed on 
embryonic stem cell research by 
former President George Bush.

In 2015 alone, the National 

Institutes of Health gave $445 
million in grants for human non-
embryonic stem cell research 
nationally. The NIH also funded 
$180 million in human embryonic 
stem cell research last year. 
According to the organization’s 
spending 
report, 
nearly 
$4.2 

million out of that total went to the 
University.

The University was able to 

develop the state’s first human 
embryonic stem cell line, or group 
of stem cells cultured in vitro, in 
2010 through the Consortium 
for Stem Cell Therapies. In 
2012, it was announced that 
the 
University’s 
first 
human 

embryonic stem cell line would be 
added to the National Institutes of 
Health’s national registry.

Maillard noted that while 

he does not directly work with 
embryonic stem cells, he thought 
2008’s Proposal 2 affected the 
stem cell research field as a whole.

“(Proposal 2) has expanded 

the potential of researchers at the 
University to derive new lines of 
embryonic stem cells for research 
purposes,” 
Maillard 
said. 
“It 

has ensured that this remains 
something 
that 
was 
possible 

in Michigan in general and at 

the University of Michigan in 
particular.”

However, 
there 
is 
also 

still 
significant 
controversy 

surrounding the research. There 
are many groups opposed to stem 
cell research, such as Concerned 
Women for America, a national 
interest group that has decried 
federal and state measures to make 
the research legal. Because the 
group believes that life begins at 
conception, they see research like 
that performed at the University 
destructive to human life.

At the University itself, there 

is also dissent from parts of 
the student body. LSA junior 
Rachel Crawford, vice president 
of Students for Life, said the 
organization only supports adult 
stem cell research.

“We do oppose all embryonic 

stem cell research because it 
destroys that human embryo,” 
Crawford said. “In order to 
procure any kind of stem cells 
from an embryo you have to 
destroy it.”

Crawford said many believe 

a moral question remains as to 
whether it should be permissible to 
create the excess human embryos 
to begin with, due to the fact that 
genetically 
mutated 
embryos, 

sometimes donated for research, 
often have to be discarded.

“In the past years, adult stem 

cells have been used to treat 
more than 70 conditions but 
never had a condition treated by 
using embryonic stem cells yet,” 
Crawford said. “A lot of the strains 
that they create from them often 
have to be discarded because of 
genetic mutation.”

Maillard said from a scientific 

perspective, 
the 
research 
is 

justified in using embryos that 
otherwise 
would 
have 
been 

discarded.

“The reality is that there is not 

a single embryo that is used for 
research unless it has already been 
decided that it would be otherwise 
discarded,” Maillard said. “All the 
embryos that are used in research 
would otherwise be discarded as 
medical waste.”

Jason 
Spence, 
assistant 

professor 
of 
cell 
and 

developmental 
biology, 
works 

with both embryonic and induced 
pluripotent stem cells. Induced 
pluripotent stem cells, or IPs, are 
grown in a dish and potentially 
have the ability to become any 
human tissue.

at the University, during the event. 
Approximately 
27.8 
percent 
of 

female undergraduates, 11.8 percent 
of male undergraduates, 21.5 percent 
of female graduate students and 10.3 
percent of male graduate students 
who responded to the survey 
screened positive for an eating 
disorder.

The survey also showed that 

treatment levels remain low: 82 
percent of women and 96 percent 
of men who screened positive did 
not seek treatment. As well, even in 
the absence of a diagnosable eating 
disorder, many respondents suffered 
from body image, self-confidence 
and self-worth issues.

Along with their presentation, 

the group also held an open dialogue 
session with three panelists.

In response to a question about 

how eating disorders affect different 
genders, age groups and identities, 
Stephanie 
Koenig, 
leader 
and 

founder of Project Heal southeast 
Michigan’s 
chapter, 
affirmed 

that anyone can be vulnerable to 
suffering an eating disorder.

“Eating disorders can affect 

anybody, regardless of age and 
gender,” she said. “The fact that 
people 
have 
better 
access 
to 

treatment can skew statistics. Some 
are also less likely to seek treatment 
because of stigma, shame and 
cultural factors.”

On campus, the U-SHAPE survey 

noted prevalence of both stigma and 
perceived stigma surrounding eating 

disorders. More than 60 percent of 
students surveyed said they thought 
peers would think less of them if 
they had an eating disorder; 30 
percent said they would think less of 
peer with an eating disorder.

Fawcett also pointed to the 

potentially devastating effects of an 
eating disorder on the body.

“In our center, we teach how 

eating disorders affects the three Bs: 
brains, bones and baby. Bones: people 
with eating disorders are at risk of 
low bone density and osteoporosis. 
A woman who is malnourished for 
a long time might not be able to have 
a baby. Finally, the brain shrinks and 
loses gray and white matter when 
the body is malnourished.”

While these health effects can be 

mitigated with early treatment, some 
might ultimately be irreversible, 
Fawcett added.

All three panelists agreed that 

starting a conversation with a friend 
whom you suspect has an eating 
disorder is difficult but necessary.

Engineering sophomore Maggie 

Hafers, a panelist, pointed out 
the importance of discerning the 
meaning behind each response and 
taking follow-up action.

“A super defensive reaction is a 

huge red flag. Don’t stop there. Don’t 
let the person convince you that 
what they do is normal,” Hafers said.

Fawcett suggested a gentle, kind 

and direct approach when reaching 
out to someone you suspect has an 
eating disorder.

Koenig also addressed the need to 

be sensitive in choice of comments 
and language.

“Saying things like, ‘I ate, then 

went home to do crunches so I could 
eat more’ — that could set someone 
else who already has disordered 
thinking off on a slippery slope.”

Hafers 
said 
supportive 

friendships were key to her own 
decision to seek treatment and 
recover from an eating disorder that 
had affected her since sophomore 
year of high school.

“As a friend, you can create a 

supportive, inclusive and blame-free 
environment,” she said. “My best 
friend accompanied me to my first 
appointment on campus, and came 
with me for subsequent therapy 
sessions.”

The panel also pointed to available 

resources like the online toolkit 
provided by the National Eating 
Disorder Association. On campus, 
students can seek help from the 
UM Counseling and Psychological 
Services.

Though 
acknowledging 
the 

difficulties inherent in overcoming 
eating disorders, the panel stressed 
that a complete recovery is possible.

“There is a commonly held belief 

that recovery from eating disorders 
isn’t possible — once you get it you 
are always going to have it. I saw 
therapists and doctors who told me 
that,” Koenig said. “Project Heal 
believes that full recovery, both 
physical and mental, is possible. 
It is possible, I have reached that 
point.”

LSA freshman Emma Kuske 

said she decided to attend the panel 
because of the many people in her 
social circle who suffer from eating 
disorders or have family histories of 
the disorder.

of the Student Financial Aid 
Association, was the main speaker 
for the event. Bhaumik is also a 
staff member in the University’s 
Financial Aid office, and teaches a 
class on the topic, UC 170.

Bhaumik started the seminar 

with a clarification on the definition 
of financial literacy.

“I think financial education is 

really about being savvy,” she said. 
“You have to be educated but take 
it to the next level. Start to become 
strategic. Start to become mindful of 
the choices you make because that’s 
the whole point of being savvy.”

Bhaumik said first steps for 

students are organizing the reality 
of their spending, their financial 
state 
and 
setting 
reasonable 

financial goals, reminding students 
to organize before budgeting and 
saving.

“We usually get this wrong,” 

Bhaumik said. “Many of us are 
taught: save, save, save. I put 10 
percent of my paycheck into my 
savings account, every paycheck, 
but I take $100 out a week later. 
That’s 
not 
saving, 
that’s 
bad 

budgeting.”

Other topics covered including 

knowing the specifics of your 
spending and the importance of 
renter’s insurance.

The seminar also discussed 

credit, which Bhaumik called a 
“measure of your trustworthiness.”

“A lot of people are looking at that 

credit report,” she said, explaining 
that landlords and employers look 
at credit to evaluate the timeliness 
of one’s payments and financial 
awareness. “Take seriously that 
payment and debt.”

Bhaumik ended the seminar 

with 10 tips, which included: “Be 
proactive, 
not 
reactive,” 
“keep 

records organized” and put a special 
emphasis on “create a budget and 
stick with it.”

Strobl said the seminar was 

just the beginning of a CSG plan 
to increase finance education on 
campus.

“We are hoping to have a series 

of events like college affordability, 
financial literacy,” he said. “We are 
hoping to have one on paying your 
taxes, and we are hoping to have 
a panel with state legislators on 
how the state of Michigan is trying 
to make college be much more 
affordable for students.”

Some of the students who 

attended the seminar, such as LSA 
senior Michael Garbose, said they 
were interested in business as a 
career option or wanted to learn 
how to support themselves in the 
future.

“I have taken some classes 

in economics and business in 
general, and I just wanted some 
better practical knowledge moving 
forward,” Garbose said. “I plan to go 
to business school and get my MBA 
in the future, and I figured that this 
could be a good starting point.”

The best revenge is your paper

As he entered the polished ware-

house to raucous applause, Sen. Marco 
Rubio (R–Fla.) stepped up to the stage 
flanked by signs that read: “End the 
debt.” If only it was that simple.

Curiously, he chose to hold 

this rally — the same night as the 
Nevada caucuses — at Lacks Enter-
prises just outside of Grand Rapids, 
a seemingly indistinguishable cor-
porate office on an average service 
road. Maybe because it was home 
to a private enterprise, a facet of 
our economy that Rubio described 
as “the only economic model in the 
world where you make poor people 
rich without making rich people 
poor.” This style of verbose rheto-
ric made up almost the entirety 
of his speech. I struggled to tally 
the number of times he empha-
sized how this election was “the 
most important one” of our time. 
He railed against Democratic can-
didates Bernie Sanders — whom 
he described as a “nice guy, here’s 
the problem: He’s a socialist” — 
and Hillary Clinton — whom he 
said was “disqualified” from being 
president because she “lied to the 
families of American servicemen,” 
referencing the Benghazi scandal. 
He denounced President Obama, 
and the crowd roared. He detested 
the closing of the Guantanamo Bay 
detention center, and pandemo-
nium ensued. Though Rubio has 
recently been criticized for sticking 
to a script, he did just that. 

Nevertheless, his message was 

clear and concise, though at times he 
subtly contradicted himself. If he went 
off track denouncing Democrats, he 
would immediately flip the script and 
espouse optimism in statements such 
as, “When I’m president, I will be the 
president for all Americans, not just 
those who voted for me.”

In my mind, Rubio’s self-identi-

fied pure conservatism is still up for 
debate. Though on some issues, it’s 
undeniable. A consistent war hawk 
in the Senate, Rubio broached the 
subject of national defense by stat-
ing, “My number-one priority is to 
undertake a Reagan-style rebuild-

ing of the military.” To a nation that, 
after over a decade of constant war, 
should be weary of military conflict, 
it’s hard to imagine this message 
would resonate with the American 
public at large. But to an increasing-
ly far-right Republican voter base, it 
is music to frustrated ears.

What remains to be seen is how 

exactly he would go about accom-
plishing all of what he expresses in 
his lofty rhetoric. To close a segment 
on how student loans are extraor-
dinarily burdensome for college 
graduates, he attempted to reassure 
the crowd: “We have a plan for that.” 
When he spoke of numerous foreign 
policy conundrums, he said current-
ly we have a “symbolic war on terror. 
I will bring a real war.” What that 
meant exactly is of critical impor-
tance, but at this juncture in the 
race, there’s no impetus for Rubio to 
provide specific policies, especially 
when his chief rival resorts to big-
otry and self-aggrandizement as a 
way of garnering voters (seemingly 
a great tactic nowadays).

Primaries are primaries; can-

didates will always put on a guise 
of ideological consistency during 
this time, when party voters would 
rather listen to Obama-bashing 
than images of future compromise. 
Rubio has been extraordinarily 
successful to this end. Yet, he has 
apparently become the one person 
who can bridge the pragmatism of 
establishment Republicans with 
the brash ideologues of the Tea 
Party faction.

Near the end of the rally, a gentle-

man standing in front of me turned 
around and said, “He’s doing a 
great job, isn’t he?” In an effort to 
appear impartial, I shrugged. How-
ever, in my mind I pondered why 
Rubio wasn’t leading the polls if 
he constantly performed as he did 
Tuesday night. He has tremendous 
appeal, even to more moderate 
voters. A fresh face, Cuban roots, 
compassionate conservative foun-
dations, a successful legislative 
career; just switch out the race and 
ideology and you have a close copy 

of Barack Obama in 2008.

The problem for Rubio seems to 

be an electorate that doesn’t fit with 
his message. The country is different 
now, and the current campaign cycle 
certainly illustrates this point. Gone 
are the days of “hope and change.” 
Now, at least in Republican circles, 
the message has become akin to: 
“Doom and gloom, but I can fix it.” 
Rubio’s fleeting optimistic enthu-
siasm regarding the future may be 
too late. As Donald Trump’s ascen-
dency becomes reality, it is evident 
that a candidate’s tone should match 
voters’ outlook: anger. Rubio has 
increased this form of bombast, but 
at this point, he needs to increase his 
delegate count.

The road ahead for Rubio is 

riddled with obstacles. Upcoming 
primaries look favorable to Trump, 
who, with recent victories in New 
Hampshire, South Carolina and now 
Nevada, could virtually lock up the 
nomination with a sweep of South-
ern states. Moreover, the remaining 
mainstream candidates continue 
to nab potential voters from Rubio, 
namely Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. 
Thus, don’t be surprised if we start 
hearing more and more desperation 
eek from Rubio’s stump speeches as 
the final hour draws nearer.

For the sake of the Republican 

Party, Rubio should be the nominee. 
Obviously, he’s not the perfect can-
didate. His aggressive foreign policy 
and ultra-conservatism regarding 
social issues certainly make him less 
palatable in a general election. It is 
also disconcerting to hear nothing 
substantive from him, but again, this 
isn’t a surprise in today’s Republi-
can primary. But, juxtaposed with 
the option of Trump or Ted Cruz, 
there’s no deliberating. If Republi-
cans want to win in November, they 
should start flocking behind Rubio. 
Ideally, his disposition will calm 
during a general election.

For now, let’s just hope he gets 

there.

The curious case of Marco Rubio

B

eauty, perseverance and possibility: 
three adjectives that embody the blend 
of attendees of the 21st annual Black 

Solidarity 
Conference. 

Over this past Valentine’s 
Day weekend, more than 
400 Black college students 
representing 50 colleges 
and 
universities 
nation-

wide networked with one 
another and participated in 
small group discussions at 
Yale University. The series 
of college uprisings regard-
ing race relations over the 
past few years set the tone 
for the conference, titled 
“The Miseducation: Changing History as We 
Know It.”

In anticipation of the conference, I was elat-

ed with the idea of being surrounded by young 
Black people uniting themselves in a space 
to learn and heal from the ongoing physical, 
political and economic violence administered 
against Black bodies. But by the time the con-
ference concluded, I felt slightly underwhelmed 
by the conversations taking place. Instead of 
the conference serving as a place for sharing 
best practices for protesting, creating tangible 
demands and building cross-campus alliances, 
our comments largely centered around the 
growing pains of being Black at a predominate-
ly white institution.

The barriers to inclusion, diversity and 

equity of Black university students at predomi-
nantly white institutions are obvious flaws in 
higher education institutions that students can 
easily rally around. However, the more obscure 
but ever-present symptom of systemic oppres-
sion is the overlap of class and race. The con-
sequences of systemic oppression on race and 
class have been conjoined as the thesis for Black 
mobilization, without critical examination of 
their intersectionality in contemporary Black 
movements. In consequence, some of the Black 
university students’ demands for racial justice 
can be narrow in scope.

At the BSC, I could not help but notice that 

there were no community college students or 
nontraditional students in attendance. Stu-
dents at the conference primarily attended elite 
institutions. In the workshop titled Why Class 
Matters, the majority of attendees were from 
professional middle-class families, and a few 
students were from working-class families. We 
were able to afford the time and money to spend 
a weekend at Yale discussing issues pertinent to 
the Black community.

As much as I had anticipated learning pro-

testing strategies from university students at 
this conference, I realized that the majority 
of Black social movements across the United 
States this year were grassroots-organized, and 
largely led and participated by working-class 
Black people. Where were their voices in this 
conversation? The voices of the working-class 
Black activists who protested in Chicago, Bal-
timore, Cincinnati and Ferguson. The voices of 
Detroit community organizers who make time 
to enact social change in their neighborhoods.

The students of BSC were a fusion of activ-

ists and academics in the making. Both are 
necessary for collective movement building. 
Academics and activists come from a diversity 
of class statuses; their class backgrounds serve 

as examples for building mixed-class coali-
tions for racial justice. The impact of class 
on the structural violence that takes place in 
Black communities underlies the overarch-
ing goal of racial justice. Without directly 
addressing class, how can we accurately and 
authentically ensure all Black interests con-
tribute to the movement?

American historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. 

said, “The class divide is, in my opinion, one 
of the most important and overlooked factors 
in the rise of Black Lives Matter, led by a new 
generation of college graduates and students.” 
The Why Class Matters workshop facilitator 
used Gates’ statement to highlight that Afri-
can Americans have primarily focused their 
efforts on fighting racial injustice, so much so 
that addressing class impacts has been on the 
peripheral of modern racial justice movements.

In my opinion, the class divide within Black 

America is not overlooked, but collateral to cur-
rent racial justice demands. After all, racism is 
inherently intertwined with economic, politi-
cal and social injustice, and therefore cannot 
be completely untied to the struggle for racial 
justice and social equity. Throughout history, 
Blacks have consistently called for better hous-
ing policies, living wage rates, and equal access 
to quality education and health care.

Booker T. Washington beckoned African 

Americans to concentrate their energy on 
industrial education and accumulating wealth. 
The Black Panther Party’s Ten-Point Program 
demanded tangible policies that tackled eco-
nomic inequality as a means to obtain racial 
equity. Today’s racial wealth gap is wider than it 
was in the 1960s. Economic mobility has always 
been a priority in Black liberation. Income and 
wealth divides within Black America have 
generated a secondary marginalization of low-
income Black people that social movements 
indirectly address. The Black Lives Matter 
movement’s guiding principles do not explicitly 
state economic justice as a platform, but says it 
could be encompassed in the “Black families,” 
“Black villages” and “collective value” precepts.

The assessment of class impacts on Black 

movements needs to be more intentional in 
order to mobilize direct action for racial jus-
tice that is inclusive of all Black Americans. 
The lack of intentional reflection about class 
explains why class is not overtly included in the 
framework of current racial movements.

How often do we ask ourselves what the 

strengths and limitations of our class back-
grounds are, and examine how our backgrounds 
inform our approach to racial injustice? How 
can we be more inclusive in ensuring all class 
divisions — poor, working class, professional 
middle class, upper class and even a portion of 
the “1 percent” — have their voices and interests 
in conversations around social change?

Discussing class is a messy topic. I left that 

workshop with more questions than answers, 
but I came to two realizations: 1. Cross-class 
alliance building is fundamental to securing 
Black liberation by helping the most mar-
ginalized populations and 2. Beyoncé wisely 
noted that the best revenge is our paper, and 
Blacks need to ensure everyone has the paper 
to bring our material and political aspirations 
to actualization.

n Michael Moore’s newest 
film, “Where to Invade Next,” 
Moore goes on an international 

tour in order to 
“steal” the best 
aspects of other 
countries’ social 
politics. 
The 

film, which is an 
almost-two-hour 
critique of Amer-
ica’s social fab-
ric — its schools, 
its prisons, its 
eroding 
middle 

class 
— 
some-

how conveys a 
profound 
sense 

of optimism. Moore ends the film 
by reminding us that other nations’ 
current bustling, successful systems 
derive from methods and notions 
first developed in the United States. 
In order for us to change our ways, 
he says, we must only look inward, to 
our past, to ourselves.

In other words, the power lies 

within us to create the world that 
many so desperately seek: a world 
that, poetically, might include ele-
mentary school students — regard-
less of socioeconomic status — being 
fed gourmet lunches by real chefs, 
or prisoners — no matter how severe 
their crimes — being placed in pris-
ons where rehabilitation and re-
entrance are actually possible, or 
teenagers attending world-class uni-
versities for free.

This message — turning inward 

to drive us forward — represents 
democratic empowerment. No mat-
ter who you are, inherently, as an 
American, you have the right, and 
thus, potentially, the power to cre-
ate the change you seek. This idea 
rests at the heart of “equality,” the 
core principal of our founding docu-
ments. And yet today, in our political 
discourse, this kind of empower-
ment is derided as overly “optimis-
tic,” as far too “ideal” of a wish.

Despite 
the 
film’s 
relentless, 

empirical critique of how we con-
duct ourselves today, it is a classically 
American text. The very idea of open-
ing a dialogue that allows for criticism 
is an extension of this idea of “equal-
ity”: Together, by honestly examining 
what our brothers and sisters around 
the world are doing best, we can bet-
ter ourselves, we can learn, we can 
become equally egalitarian.

In the film’s final scene, Moore 

walks next to what remains of the 
Berlin Wall, a divide that, as Moore 
remarks, was once built to stand for 
eternity, but was actually torn down 
in just a matter of years. One can 
imagine the minds of those people 

who fought for its destruction — 
despite every societal force stacking 
up against them, they had a vision 
for the world within them, and that 
vision drove their actions. Moore, 
who by the film’s end dubs himself 
an “idealist,” has created a pro-
foundly optimistic text: By looking 
inward to our pasts as Americans 
as well as to our comrades’ efforts 
from across the oceans, we can real-
ize even our wildest ideals. 

And this classically American 

film, furthermore, ought to inform 
how we locate ourselves along the 
political 
spectrum 
during 
this 

ongoing election season. Over the 
past several weeks, my friends have 
often asked me to give my pitch 
about why I wholeheartedly sup-
port Bernie Sanders. After I dis-
cuss his policies, his integrity and 
his boldness, my friends will often 
say something to the effect of: “Oh 
yeah, that would all be nice, but it’s 
just too idealistic of a vision.”

Moore’s film speaks volumes 

about the numbness and insensibil-
ity of this notion that we ought not 
strive toward idealism and instead 
settle for the system under which we 
currently live. It seems these friends 
of mine do not believe that the type 
of radical social change that Moore 
directly observes has taken place in 
the world. These friends of mine do 
not believe that this kind of change 
can happen here, nor that we ought 
to vote for a system whose leader is 
proposing that it might.

I don’t want to use this as a plat-

form to advocate for my political 
beliefs — by all means, support 
whomever you wish. I just cannot 
fathom why or how we have, some-
where along the line, lowered our 
expectations for what is possible by 
such a great margin to the point that 
the world that we all wish to one 
day inhabit — which, for a moment 
at least, comes alive through bits 
and pieces from throughout the 
world in Moore’s masterpiece — is 
unrealizable, a fantasy.

As a heterosexual white man, soci-

ety has never institutionally tried to 
shut me up. I understand that mil-
lions of people, because of identi-
ties out of their control, have been 
and will continue to be kicked to the 
curb and silenced by our world that 
prefers and judges people based on 
their given identities. This becomes 
an opportunity for the rest of us — 
the privileged rest of us, who are 
not societally and institutionally 
targeted for certain identities and 
circumstances beyond our control — 
to fight. Everyone, then, from those 
people who society has institution-

ally marginalized to those it has left 
untouched, has an opportunity to 
fight together.

Those who dismiss these con-

cepts as too idealistic need only 
to examine the United States’ his-
tory to find a long-lasting, deeply 
impactful social movement whose 
core philosophy was one of mutual 
respect and love. In “The Power of 
Non-violence,” Martin Luther King 
Jr. describes a kind of “agape love,” 
one that is neither aesthetic nor 
reciprocated. Yet he believes agape 
love to be a catalyzing idea that all 
Americans must adopt: “And when 
you come to love on this level you 
begin to love men not because they 
are likeable … but because God loves 
them and here we love the person 
who does the evil deed while hating 
the deed the person does.”

Instead of giving up, we ought to 

fight, and within this activism lies 
the truest form of love: the belief 
that we are all divine, we all con-
tain the potential for divinity. As 
Moore’s film argues, egalitarian 
generosity lies deeply within the 
fabric of American society.

I would characterize this rejection 

of idealism both as cowardly and self-
ish. If you believe this world is good 
enough, that our country is living up 
to its standards, then you are ignoring 
the realities of millions of your broth-
ers and sisters, millions of your fellow 
Americans, who did just as little to 
arrive in their circumstances as you 
did to arrive in yours. Acknowledge 
your privilege as someone the world 
has, for no real reason at all, selected to 
spare, and then use your place in soci-
ety to advocate for the basic liberties of 
the rest of our populus.

The optimism of Moore’s film 

comes from its belief that change, 
inherently, lies within us. It preaches 
a message of empowerment. This 
“ideal” vision should not be castigat-
ed, because it is a vision that includes 
a people who are ideal toward each 
other, a people who fight for each 
other. And we are that people. To 
dismiss the ideal is to say that you 
are not capable of such generosity, 
of such strength. And I think that’s 
a tragedy. When did it become so 
outlandish to believe that you can be 
whatever you wish?

Moore’s film advocates for gener-

osity on a national scale among citi-
zens. We must collectively believe 
we are capable of this kind of inter-
mingling. Otherwise, who are we? 
An acceptingly, admittedly cruel 
people? I reject that.

Thome’s confidence building

Freshman center 

now shooting 

65 percent from 
free-throw line

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

With 10 seconds left and her 

team up by three points, Hallie 
Thome stepped up to the free-
throw line. She had been in 
a similar situation before. In 
December, she missed both of her 
free throws as the Wolverines 
lost to Eastern Michigan in 
heartbreaking fashion.

But 
in 
last 
Saturday’s 

matchup against Penn State, the 
freshman center sank both of 
her foul shots with ease. Instead 
of her shots rimming out, her 

scores from the charity stripe 
were proverbial daggers into 
any hope the Nittany Lions had 
for a comeback.

The 
stark 

contrast 
between 
the 

two 
games, 

nearly 
two 

months apart, 
display 
how 

Thome has not 
just improved 
her free throw 
shooting, but 
her confidence 
as 
well. 

Thome said the most improved 
facet of her game has been her 
performance from the foul line. 
After a rough start to the season, 
Thome has worked up to 65 
percent from the charity stripe. 
It isn’t a stellar number, but it’s a 
sign of her growth.

The 
confidence 
she 
has 

gained since the beginning of 
the season has shown in her 
results. Against Penn State, she 

shot 
4-for-6 

from the line, 
but the last 
two 
proved 

to 
be 
most 

important, 
as she looked 
anything 
but 

tentative after 
being fouled.

“I’m 
not 

worrying 
when I go up 

to the line (anymore), just being 
calm and collected,” Thome 
said.

After missed free throws 

doomed 
the 
Wolverines 
in 

three-straight late-game losses 
to Eastern Michigan, Purdue 
and Indiana, Michigan coach 

Kim Barnes Arico worked with 
the team on free throws to 
replace the feeling of pressure 
with confidence. Both the team 
as a whole and individuals on 
their own practiced shooting 
from the line. Because of the 
improvement, the Wolverines 
haven’t let games slip away 
late when they had a chance 
to secure the win since the 
overtime loss to Indiana.

“Coming into the Big Ten 

with games on the line, you have 
to make two free throws to win 
it,” Barnes Arico said. “That’s 
tough. That’s tough for anybody, 
especially a freshman.”

Barnes Arico has been telling 

Thome to take her time and 
not think about shooting it so 
much. The advice has spread 
out to the rest of the team, 
as Michigan has been able 
to beat Iowa, Minnesota and 
Penn State (twice) because of a 
relaxed approach to the nerve-
wracking nature of a wide-open 
shot with the game on the line 
and all eyes on you. Tuesday 
against 
Northwestern, 
the 

Wolverines went 7-for-8 from 
the free-throw line to complete 
a hard-fought 70-65 victory, 
and Thome went 6-for-7 in the 
winning effort.

The experience Thome has 

had in her freshman season is 
invaluable. As Barnes Arico can 
attest, her improvement has 
just begun.

“(Thome) has a great touch, 

and part of it is being able 
to be in those situations and 
handle the pressure,” Barnes 
Arico said. “She’s definitely 
gotten better at handling that. 
It’s great for her to be in those 
positions as much as possible 
and to have the confidence that 
she can make them.”

DAVID SONG/Daily

Center Hallie Thome is becoming more confident, particularly at the free-throw line, as her freshman season progresses.

“You have to 
make two free 
throws to win it. 

That’s tough.”

BASEBALL
Jaskie emerges 
for Wolverines

By ETHAN WOLFE

Daily Sports Writer

While expectations were high 

for junior left-handed pitcher 
Brett Adcock and sophomore 
right-hander Ryan Nutof against 
Canisius, it was sophomore left-
hander Oliver Jaskie who shined 
for the Michigan baseball team.

As a freshman in 2015, Jaskie 

had only one start to his name 
in 22 appearances, posting a 2-0 
record and a 5.58 earned-run 
average.

While Jaskie began the season 

as 
Michigan’s 

fourth starter, 
he looked like 
the Wolverines’ 
ace on Sunday 
against 
the 
Golden 

Griffins. 
Jaskie 
tossed 

six 
innings, 

allowing 
just 

three hits and 
recording nine 
strikeouts on his way to picking 
up the win. His performance 
earned him Big Ten Pitcher of the 
Week honors.

Jaskie doesn’t care too much 

about the accolades, though.

“Honestly, I’m more excited 

about the team’s success this 
week,” Jaskie said. “Every pitcher 
that got in there did really well. It 
was awesome to see.”

At Michigan’s team banquet 

on Feb. 12, Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich commended Jaskie for 
how he trained over the summer 
and how much he has improved 
since last season. Bakich joked 
that his command was so good 
that he couldn’t throw a ball 
straight if he tried.

Jaskie credits pitching coach 

Sean Kenny for his development 

since last year.

“Coach 
Kenny 
has 
been 

awesome,” Jaskie said. “He’s 
the best pitching coach in the 
country. He does everything he 
could possibly do for us, and we 
love him for that.”

Bakich expects Jaskie to be 

a starter for the entirety of the 
2016 season and is excited about 
his potential after his outing 
against Canisius.

“I think what you saw on 

Sunday is a byproduct of a kid with 
a tremendous work ethic and an 
extremely high character,” Bakich 

said. 
“The 

success that he 
has on the field 
is the byproduct 
of 
many 

things, but the 
investment 
he makes into 
pitching 
and 

into his craft 
is what you’re 
seeing.”

The 
craft 

Bakich is referring to is Jaskie’s 
repertoire of pitches. Coming 
out of high school with a fastball, 
breaking ball and changeup, 
Jaskie has also been developing 
his slider since last season.

If Sunday was any indication 

of how Jaskie will pitch for the 
rest of the season, he will soon 
become a household name.

But Jaskie isn’t worrying about 

the rest of the season right now.

“It feels great having some 

momentum at the start of the 
season,” Jaskie said. “Hopefully 
we can carry that into our 
training 
sessions 
this 
week 

and then carry those training 
sessions over to our games in 
our upcoming Spring Break. But 
right now we’re just focusing on 
today and we go from there.”

“It feels great 

having momentum 
at the start of the 

season.”

Romero’s big hit 
shows her focus

By ORION SANG

It was the top of the seventh 

inning, and the No. 2 Michigan 
softball team was clinging to a 3-2 
lead against No. 13 Florida State.

Senior 
All-American 
second 

baseman Sierra Romero stepped up 
to the plate with senior outfielder 
Sierra Lawrence at first base.

Up until that point, Romero 

had been 0-for-3 with three 
strikeouts in an uncharacteristic 
performance at the plate for the 
star infielder.

But with one swing, she righted 

the ship.

Romero 

crushed a home 
run 
to 
right 

field, and the 
Wolverines 
could 
breathe 

easier.

When asked 

about 
what 

she was trying 
to do heading 
into that fateful 
at-bat, Romero 
was blunt.

“Swing the bat,” Romero said.
For Romero, hitting has always 

been a strength of her game, and 
she didn’t let her minor cold spell 
interfere with her mentality.

“I just had to not get down on 

myself,” Romero said. “I knew it 
was coming. (It was) just a matter 
of time.”

That 
simple 
approach 
is 

symbolic of the team’s uniform 
batting approach.

While individual players may 

have slight variations in their 
approach, every player is taught 
to follow one mantra religiously — 
“one-pitch focus.”

“The one-pitch mentality is 

just focusing on one pitch at a 
time,” Romero said. “(You aren’t) 
worrying about what you think 
they’re going to throw to you 
or what they threw to you in 
the past, and (you’re) just going 
up there with a clear mind and 
trying to hit.”

It’s a focus that Michigan 

has stuck to for years, and that 
focus has led the Wolverines to 
develop a potent offense that 
averages 1.44 home runs per 
game, reaches base at a .450 clip 
and has a .349 batting average.

But the scariest thing for 

opponents is that Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins doesn’t believe 
her team is hitting to its full 
potential yet.

“I think we’re still learning 

that (one-pitch focus) as a team,” 
Hutchins said. “My upperclassmen 
understand it better, but (the 
team) hasn’t been able to execute 
it as they’re capable of.

“Kids 
have 

to learn how to 
do it because 
their minds are 
much 
faster 

and they’ll play 
out 
a 
whole 

inning and all 
the scenarios, 
(and) therefore 
they’re 
not 

focused on the 
ball. 
We’ve 

just got to focus on the pitch now 
because it’s the only one that 
matters.”

Freshman 
infielder 
Faith 

Canfield said that in addition to 
trying to adhere to the “one-pitch 
focus,” she and her teammates 
have put in the requisite work on 
the field.

“Whoever wants to can come in 

and hit in our hitting cage before 
practice,” Canfield said. “In the 
past during fall, we’ve come in on 
the weekends — which we have off 
— and hit and do some tee work.”

The Wolverines can continue 

to improve on their batting 
by making sure they follow 
Hutchins’ teachings — that the 
“one-pitch focus” is tantamount 
to their success.

“It’s the mentality that will get 

them what they want,” Hutchins 
said. “Regardless of whether we’re 
ahead or behind, we have to get in 
our moment and play now. I think 
it helps us play better softball.”

“I just had to 

not get down on 
myself. I knew it 

was coming.”

‘M’ tops Northwestern

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

Just like it did in its game 

against then-No. 6 Maryland 
on Sunday, the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team 
(10-6 
Big 

Ten, 
20-9 

overall) started slow in their 
Wednesday night matchup with 
Northwestern. The difference, 
however, was that the Wolverines 
were 
at 
Crisler 
Center 
on 

Wednesday, not in a hostile road 
environment, and their opponent 
wasn’t on the same level.

Michigan was able to hold out, 

despite multiple scoring droughts, 
thanks 
to 
hot 
second-half 

scoring from sophomore guards 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur Rahkman 
and Aubrey Dawkins, beating the 
Wildcats, 72-63.

The duo combined for 30 

points, with 21 coming in the 
second frame alone.

“(Abdur-Rahkman) is really 

good 
off 
the 
dribble,” 
said 

Northwestern 
coach 
Chris 

Collins. “He did a great job 
driving the whole night. Like I 
said, he either got to the paint or 
got us in foul trouble. He wasn’t 
afraid. I thought he had some 
really impressive drives where 
he went right into our big guys — 
right into their chests — and had a 
couple big-time finishes.

“I thought he was a huge, huge 

deciding factor in why (Michigan) 
won tonight.”

Northwestern 
(5-10, 
17-11) 

steamrolled the Wolverines for 
nearly six minutes to start the 
first half, scoring 10 unanswered 
points. Junior forward Zak Irvin 
finally ended Michigan’s 0-for-8 
stretch with a layup that started 
the Wolverines’ steady comeback.

Junior guard Derrick Walton 

Jr. helped spark Michigan’s 
rally, 
scoring 
back-to-back 

underhand layups to bring the 
Wolverines within two points of 
the Wildcats with seven minutes 

to go in the first half. Abdur-
Rahkman tacked on nine more 
points in the frame, including 
three made free throws to cap 
a 9-0 Michigan run after being 
fouled on a shot-clock-beating 
3-point attempt.

The Wolverines missed their 

first eight attempts from beyond 
the arc and didn’t score their first 
triple until junior guard Duncan 
Robinson hit a buzzer-beating 3 
heading into halftime to make it 
29-28, Northwestern. 

But 
Michigan’s 
first-half 

comeback wasn’t quite enough 
to jumpstart the team, as the 
Wolverines started the second half 
in a similar fashion to the first. 

It took Michigan 5:43 to get on 

the board to start the game, and it 
took another 4:10 to score in the 
second frame. The Wildcats went 
on an 8-0 run to start the second 
half before being stopped by an 
Abdur-Rahkman layup. Again, 
Michigan had to claw back from a 
hefty deficit.

“(Northwestern) 
just 
runs 

some 
really 
good 
offense,” 

Walton said. “They ran some sets 
at a speed that it’s really hard 

to guard and protect the basket 
and worry about who you’re 
guarding. Tip your hat to them 
— a really potent offensive group, 
pretty much. We’re going to look 
at some things we can adjust, like 
always, but you’ve gotta tip your 
hat to them, they made some 
really good buckets.”

Dawkins hit a big triple, 

Michigan’s second of the game, 
at an opportune time to get the 
Wolverines within one point of 
the Wildcats. Eighty seconds 
later, he hit another one to tie up 
the game at 44. 

“It was big,” Abdur-Rakhman 

said of Dawkins’ 3-pointers. “Not 
everybody was hitting shots, but 
for him to come in off the bench 
and hit those 3s is big for us.”

Added Walton: “I don’t even 

know what we shot from 3 today, 
but I know it wasn’t too good. 
That really was a big lift, but that’s 
what he does. Time and time 
again, he just comes in and checks 
in and is making big shots. At this 
point, I’m not surprised. At this 
point, I’m just making sure that 
when he’s on the court, I’m trying 
to find him.”

With the momentum building, 

sophomore 
forward 
Kam 

Chatman grabbed Michigan’s first 
lead of the game after sinking two 
at the charity stripe.

From 
then 
on, 
Michigan 

and Northwestern traded leads 
twice, but Dawkins hit another 
important 
trey 
to 
put 
the 

Wolverines up 57-54 with 4:26 left 
to go.

Michigan didn’t look back from 

there, securing the victory when 
Dawkins went coast to coast for 
a layup to give the Wolverines a 
68-61 lead with 1:19 left. 

Junior forward Mark Donnal 

and sophomore forward Ricky 
Doyle had a tough time defending 
Northwestern big man Alex Olah 
in the first half, allowing him 
to shoot 6-for-11 for 14 points. 
Olah led the Wildcats with a 
game-high 19 points, but Abdur-
Rahkman was able to match him 
with 19 points of his own for a 
Michigan victory.

The Wolverines are keeping 

their NCAA tournament hopes 
alive, despite cutting it close 
against a mediocre Big Ten team 
at home.

Sophomore guard 
halts Northwestern 
runs as Wolverines 
avoid crushing loss

By LEV FACHER 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team has struggled 
to find an identity this season, 
and in the absence of their two 
senior stars, the Wolverines 
have taken on a few traits they 
would prefer to live without.

Among them recently has 

been a propensity to fall victim 
to game-ending runs, which 
happened twice in a five-day 
span earlier this month in home 
losses to Indiana and Michigan 
State.

The Wolverines twice seemed 

destined 
to 
suffer 
a 
third 

such run on Wednesday, until 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman stepped in.

Michigan 

began 
the 

game shooting 
0-for-8 
from 

the field and 
trailed, 
10-0, 

after 
six 

minutes 
of 

play. 
Junior 

forward 
Zak 

Irvin 
finally 

broke 
the 

drought with 
a layup, but down 13-2, it was 
Abdur-Rahkman who continued 
to chip away.

“It’s what we don’t have,” said 

Michigan coach John Beilein 
of 
Abdur-Rahkman’s 
run-

stopping effort. “It’s something 
that (senior guard Caris LeVert) 
certainly did for us.”

Abdur-Rahkman 
scored 

Michigan’s next six points to 
whittle the deficit and finished 
with 19 points, three rebounds 
and a pair of assists.

“The coaches are emphasizing 

that I have to get downhill 
and get to the basket,” Abdur-
Rahkman said. “Even Caris 
encourages me to be aggressive.”

The 
timing 
of 
Abdur-

Rahkman’s 19 points proved 
just as important as the points 
themselves, as Michigan fell 
victim to another run — this one 
8-0 — to begin the second half.

For the second time, the 

player of the night put a stop to 
the Wildcats’ momentum, this 
time with a slashing layup, then 
a lightning-quick leftward spin 
to reach the rim minutes later.

“Credit (Abdur)-Rahkman,” 

said Northwestern coach Chris 
Collins. “I thought he was 
tremendous. His ability to drive 
the ball, get by our guys, get to 
the basket, draw fouls. … If he 
did miss, we were in rotations 
so they got offensive rebounds. I 
thought he played a great game, 

and was a big difference.”

The Wolverines’ mentality 

has changed in light of the 
embarrassing losses to Indiana 
and Michigan State, and so 
has 
their 
position 
on 
the 

NCAA 
Tournament 
bubble. 

Nonetheless, 
Abdur-Rahkman 

says 
he 
hasn’t 
taken 
the 

responsibility intentionally.

On a night Michigan wasn’t 

hitting 
from 
3-point 
range, 

however, the Wolverines had 
few other options than to lean 
on the player equipped with 
moves Beilein refers to as the 
“Ali Shuffle.”

“I just know we have to get 

to the basket,” Abdur-Rahkman 
said, acknowledging his goal 
Wednesday was to “get downhill 
and just try to finish or get a foul 
and stop the run.”

Scoring in the paint has never 

been Beilein’s concern, however 
— 
it’s 
Abdur-Rahkman’s 

room for improvement in his 
distribution game that has kept 
him from having his number 
called on set plays more often.

After 

practices, 
Beilein 
said 

Wednesday, 
he 
and 

Michigan’s 
assistant 
coaches 
run 
Abdur-

Rahkman 
through 
“a 

steady diet of 
reads in the 

ball screen,” the keystone of 
Michigan’s 
perimeter-driven 

offense.

“Because his assist numbers 

weren’t what we’d like them to 
be, we were hesitant to put him 
in situations where he’s got to 
make a lot of reads,” Beilein said.

Then again, sometimes the 

potential for distribution isn’t 
what counts most.

“Reading 
is 
one 
thing,” 

Beilein said. “He also can just 
take the ball to the basket and 
get a hoop.”

Entering the season, LeVert 

was expected to be the player 
Michigan could rely on for 
a basket when the rest of its 
offense 
wasn’t 
executing. 

Though 
Irvin 
and 
junior 

guard Derrick Walton Jr. have 
shown periodic flashes of that 
takeover ability, the biggest 
value in Abdur-Rahkman’s play 
this season is his emergence as 
another go-to option.

With 
the 
two 
juniors 

suffering from fatigue entering 
Wednesday’s 
game, 
Beilein 

dialed up Abdur-Rahkman far 
more than he has in most games 
this season, and the decision 
paid off.

“Muhammad is becoming a 

guy that just gets there,” Beilein 
said. “I’d like to have more of 
those guys. We thought we had 
it with Caris, and hopefully the 
rest of our guys can grow.”

“He also can 

just take the ball 

to the basket 

and get a hoop.”

Michigan coach Red Berenson’s team could be playing for the Big Ten regular-season championship in road games Thursday and Friday at Minnesota.
Wolverines head to Minnesota

By JUSTIN MEYER 

Daily Sports Writer

The two titans of Big Ten 

hockey have spent all season 
battling for a chance to win the 
regular-season crown. Fittingly, 
that fight may 
come down to 
this weekend.

Minnesota 

(11-3 Big Ten, 
16-13 overall) 
hosts 
No. 
6 

Michigan 
on 
Thursday 

night in the 
first game of 
a 
weekend 

series 
that 

could 
shake 

up the Big Ten 
and 
national 

standings.

The Gophers are in the driver’s 

seat in the conference, with 33 
points to the Wolverines’ 32, but 
they are on the outside looking 
in on the race to the NCAA 
Tournament. Ranked at No. 16 in 
the PairWise, Minnesota needs a 

late push or a Big Ten Tournament 
title for a chance to play in April.

For Michigan (9-2-3-2, 19-4-5), 

the matchup is no less important. 
The Wolverines are desperate 
for a chance to return to the 
postseason, but a late collapse 
could still derail those hopes. A 
sweep against Minnesota would 
lock up a NCAA Tournament spot, 
while a split would also put the 
team in a strong position.

“Minnesota is a huge weekend 

for us,” said sophomore forward 
Cutler Martin. “It is going to be 
one of those miracle weekends 
where you either come away with 
the victories, and it defines our 
season, or we don’t.

“We know that this is our 

season. This is something that we 
have to be ready for.”

The two teams split an early 

conference series at Yost Ice 
Arena. 
Michigan 
dominated 

the possession in the first game, 
coasting to an 8-3 win, but fell 3-2 
the next night.

“We know how important these 

games are,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “You don’t have to 

turn it into the Stanley Cup, but 
we’re trying to play better every 
week. We think we can play better, 
and a series like this should bring 
out the best in our team.”

 The Wolverines are riding 

a tide of historic scoring and 
improved 
goaltending 
toward 

a strong regular-season finish. 
The top line of junior forwards 
Tyler Motte and JT Compher and 
freshman forward Kyle Connor 
leads the nation in nearly every 
offensive category. Motte has 
scored the opening goal in three 
consecutive games as part of a 
12-game goal streak — the longest 
in the Berenson era.

It has been a down year for 

the Gophers. After opening the 
season 4-7 in non-conference 
play, the perennial powerhouse 
has looked like at contender 
a times, and much less so at 
others. Freshman netminder Eric 
Schierhorn has been strong in 
goal, but Minnesota’s offense has 
never quite materialized.

Michigan, on the other hand, 

hasn’t lost a game in regulation 
since 
its 
last 
game 
against 

Minnesota on Dec. 12, and has 
shored up problems in net with 
the improved play of senior 
goaltender Steve Racine.

The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 

underwent a third retooling 
before the matchup against 
Ferris 
State 
last 
weekend. 

Berenson 
has 
consistently 

pointed to team defense as the 
biggest remaining concern.

Martin moved to forward while 

sophomore 
defenseman 
Sam 

Piazza moved into Martin’s place 
on the blue line. The switch gives 
the defensive unit more speed and 
adds a physical element on offense 
in the absence of sophomore 
forward Tony Calderone.

Calderone sat out against Ferris 

State, but did travel with the team 
on Wednesday.

A decisive sweep this weekend 

would cement Michigan as a 
national-title contender — and the 
Gophers know that all too well. 
That alone is enough to ensure 
that this weekend will at the very 
least provide more of the grade-A 
entertainment 
the 
Wolverines 

have delivered all season.

Sophomore guard Aubrey Dawkins hit three huge 3-pointers to lift Michigan over Northwestern on Wednesday night.


“Lazy Sunday” was blasting 

out of my dad’s office when 
he called my sisters and me in 
to watch Andy Samberg and 
Chris Parnell rhythmically talk 
about Narnia and Magnolia 
cupcakes. At the time, I wasn’t 
completely sure what was going 
on in the small video box on 
the screen, but I laughed along 
because all the older, wiser 
members of my family were. 
Quickly, Samberg’s voice was 
followed up by the blaring tune 
of “Numa Numa” featuring an 
overweight man gesticulating 
wildly on screen — and my 
introduction to YouTube was 
officially 
complete. 
“Numa 

Numa” played us out.

Born in the digital age, 

I never had any difficulty 
grasping 
the 
concept 
of 

YouTube. While it was foreign 
in the face of adults who were 
still wrapping their minds 
around DVD, YouTube was 
just another format on the 
continuously growing list of 
platforms that allowed me to 

publicize my life to friends 
and strangers alike. I would 
obsessively watch MadTV’s 
Stuart 
squealing, 
“Look 

what I can do!” and track 
down bootlegged episodes of 
“The Suite Life of Zack and 
Cody” while simultaneously 
loading low-quality, pixelated 
versions of PG-13 movies at 
the scandalous age of 10. The 
buffering symbol was the bane 
of my existence as a child, 
but little did I know that the 
Internet was preparing me for 
an acid wash that no chemical 
compound could sustain.

So let’s take it back, to Natalie 

Zak circa the seventh grade. 
Privileged and spoiled, I was 
blessed with the opportunity to 
go to London at age 11, an age 
where I could at least pretend 
to appreciate world cultures 
(while in reality I was slightly 
confused about how geography 
works). I remember boarding 
the plane while still fuzzy 
on the concept of countries 
and land masses; even then, a 

casual onlooker could tell my 
future was bright.

A trip highlighted by art 

galleries and carefully selected 
Gap Kids outfits, it marked 
a substantial shift in my 
adolescence and personality. 
Turning on the TV in the 
hotel room to find YouTube an 
available application, my sisters 
and I immediately logged on 
and were greeted by the fateful 
words that will forever be 
seared in my memory: “Alex 
Reads Twilight: Chapter 1.”

I was doomed before we 

even 
finished 
the 
video. 

Like any adolescent, I was 
experiencing my middle school 
excursion into Anglophilia that 
involved Union Jack T-shirts 
and a feigned passion for The 
Beatles (whom I couldn’t have 
known less about at the time). 
Had it not been for the video of 
a scrawny, overly opinionated 
British teenager, I could have 
escaped this phase unscathed. 
Instead, I came out bruised 
and bloody on the other side, 

having lost years of my life to 
an endless series of five-minute 
rants and ramblings.

“Alex 
Reads 
Twilight” 

served as my entrance into the 
world of British YouTube, and 
I was immediately hooked. I 
took in everything Alex Day 
said as the word of God even 
though his godless existence 
preached nothing of value. 
His 
outlandish 
ideas 
and 

championed causes became 
ones I ran around proclaiming. 
Through a platform of easily 
manipulated tween girls, Day 
built his career.

From the snarkiness and 

sass of “nerimon,” I moved 
to the lighter, more cheerful 
Charlie McDonnell, otherwise 
known as “charlieissocoollike.” 
While watching him dye his 
hair red and adorn token 
glasses, I learned of a little 
button underneath the video 
that urged me to make the 
relationship 
binding 
¬—

Confessions of a Middle School Anglophile: 
The Toxic YouTube Vlogger Community

By Natalie Zak,
Daily Community Culture Editor

DESIGN BY SCOTTY HARDIN & JACKLYN THOMAS


2B — Thursday, February 25, 2016
the b-side
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

My 
digital 
footprint 

expanded as I moved from 
90-pound 
“Doctor 
Who” 

fanatics to a 30-year-old nerd 
sitting at home building a brand 
off of the blind devotion of 
13-year-old kids.

And I was one of those 

13-year-olds. I couldn’t help it 
— the community made me feel 
superior. Looking back, it may 
have been the first time I felt a 
sense of culture and belonging. 
Never before had I been a part of 
such an expansive community 
of shared interests. I never 
commented on a video and I 
never attended any gatherings, 
but somehow I still felt a part of 
a larger movement, and that’s 
what made it special. I was a 
small part of a community that 
mattered.

It’s too bad though that it 

took me. Young and easily 
manipulated, I adapted aspects 
of these clever entrepreneurs’ 
personalities 
and 
opinions, 

proudly 
declaring 
myself 
a 

nerd because a 35-year-old man 
told me I was “awesome.” And 
maybe, just maybe, I was right to 
be full of awe as I stared at these 
great figures looming before 
me. Gazing up at their carefully 
cultivated backdrops, wardrobes 
and makeup, I laughed as they 
divulged dark secrets, instructed 
how to make the perfect cup of 
tea and reacted to a reaction of 
a reaction video of a cat. I knew 
them, and though they didn’t 
know me, that didn’t matter — I 
was still a part of a community 
that cared.

I never commented on a 

video and I never attended a 
gathering, and that made all the 
difference. Because when the 
realization of this toxic culture 
began to dawn on me, I was 
able to escape with a shred of 
dignity. As I scrolled through 
comment sections of videos, 
I would stop and stare at the 
Arial font that scrawled either 
love letters or death threats. 
Disagreement 
and 
conflict 

guaranteedly spiraled out of 
control under each video as I 
watched my heroes, astonished, 
react to the backlash against 
their carefully scripted words.

Words are words, but on the 

Internet, especially YouTube, 
they 
become 
battle 
cries, 

tabloid magazine headlines and 
national crises in a matter of 
seconds. I watched helplessly as 
videos were torn apart because 
a well-meaning girl stumbled 
over her words for a split 
second and lost half of her fans. 

I watched, seething, as a loud-
mouthed boy encouraged hatred 
and spats within his audience 
because their fierce beliefs were 
their own problem and they 
should know better than to take 
him seriously.

This deniability and failure to 

take responsibility was rampant 
in 
these 
videos. 
From 
Ben 

Cook to Alex Day to even poor 
Dan Howell, all I began to see 
were young boys in tight pants 
claiming it was the viewer’s fault 
for taking their words seriously. 
It was the 10-year-old girl’s fault 
for thinking her hero was serious 
when he said fat girls couldn’t be 
superheroes.

And then came the sexual 

assaults. Lack of accountability 
couldn’t have been more evident 
when the stories came out back 
to back about how these glorified 
celebrities had taken advantage 
of young girls and boys who 
trusted them, idolized them, 
would do anything for them. How 
these 20-somethings with their 
inflated egos took advantage of 
children because a video that got 
a million views made them feel 
justified in doing so.

Not all the YouTubers I 

watched 
and 
romanticized 

were criminals, but like any 
community, it is defined by the 
few mistakes, not the many “My 
Morning Routine” tags. There 
are, of course, the shining 
figures that rise above the 
grime and filth, but even they 
still hold unfathomable power 
that no young adult sitting in 
their bedroom with a camera 
should have.

My 
education 
in 
the 

scandalous, 
nerdy 
and 

unprecedented was completed 
by YouTube. I learned most 
swear words, entered a dark 
phase defined by time travel 
and realized what true human 
incompetence looked like. I 
feel obliged to thank it for my 
introduction 
to 
far-fetched 

worlds and ideas, but nothing 
more than obliged. There is a 
perpetual pit in my stomach 
when I think of the pedestal 
on which I once placed these 
average individuals.

The pedestal came crashing 

down my freshman year of 
high school, and I narrowly 
escaped gasping for air. Now, 

in retrospect, all I want back 
is the 99 cents I spent on each 
of these monstrosities’ music 
singles. Sadly though, youthful 
naivety has its cost and mine 
was heavily invested in the 
repeated failed attempts to get 
a tone-deaf teen to number one. 
My iTunes library is scarred by 
their poppy, overly produced 
tracks and maybe that’s why 
I find myself dependent on 
Spotify these days, immediately 
X-ing out of iTunes when it 
dares to show its face. 

“YouTube’s mission is to 

provide fast and easy video 
access and the ability to share 
videos frequently,” it says on 
their homepage. And that’s 
exactly what it achieves. It is 
a platform for creativity and 
innovation in a digital age. It is 
a platform for talent and humor 
to be shared and advertised. 
It is a platform for abuse and 
manipulation. Careers can be 
made or destroyed over the 
course of one YouTube video, 
and a life can hang in the balance 
of one YouTube comment. It is 
concurrently a collaborative, 
multi-platform video database 
of innovation and a cesspool 
for toxic behavior. It’s up to 
the owners, the users and 
the viewers to find a balance 
between the two.

As I scroll through the pages 

of my old YouTube stars, I can’t 
help but wonder after the book 
deals, short films and viral 
video clips, what remains of 
the person behind the camera. 
What inspires them, drives 
them to turn on that camera 
every day and address the 
adoring eyes of strangers that 
hang on their every word? And 
above all, what is life after 
YouTube? Do they just cease to 
exist? And did we ever find out 
where the hell Matt is?

I have nothing against the use 

of YouTube as a place to exhibit 
one’s talent and skill, but it’s 
the cult followings that arise 
from the especially talented 
or vivacious that unsettle me. 
There’s an air of entitlement 
and 
anonymity 
surrounding 

all partakers in the YouTube 
community; individuals on both 
sides of the screen develop the 
idea that they deserve views and 
videos, while maintaining the 
presence of half a person. The 
people we see on screen are as 
authentic as editing tools allow 
them to be — a hollowed out 
projection of fame. But 11-year-
old girls don’t know what editing 
software or authenticity is; all 
they know is the cute, sardonic 
boy on screen makes them 
laugh when he makes fun of 
“Twilight.”

While the world awaits 

the 88th Annual Oscars this 
Sunday, nostalgia crept up on 
me the other night as I thought 
about the first time I watched 
the Oscars.

It was February 29th 2004, 

and I sat on the couch with my 
dad. Being seven years old and 
raised by a film and television 
producer, I felt that a career 
in the film business would be 
appropriate. Before I learned 
cursive or multiplication, I was 
planning my profession.

That night had been 

confusing for me. I hadn’t seen 
any of the movies, but I was 
in awe of the celebrities: their 
beauty, their glamour, their 
success. I watched Ben Stiller 
and Owen Wilson present 
their hilarious introduction 
for the Short Film category 
and Charlize Theron win for 
Best Actress as she joyfully 
cried (as a majority of the 
Oscar winners do.) Despite my 
fuzzy, intangible memory, I 
would never forget watching 
the category for Best Original 
Screenplay: Sofia Coppola won 
her first ever Oscar award.

I sat wide-eyed and giddy 

when I witnessed this, though 
it was nothing ground-
breaking. But what I saw in my 
mind changed my motives and 
paved the way. Looking over 

at my dad I said, “Dad, I want 
to be like her. I want to win for 
Best Original Screenplay.” My 
dad smiled and told me I could 
do anything I put my mind to, 
and I soon found out that he 
was definitely right.

In the third grade, my class 

and I made a “life” chart, in 
which each student had to 
write about their interests — 
including what they wanted 
to be when they grow up. 
The other nine year olds had 
similar passions ranging from 
“I want to be a doctor,” or 
“the president,” etc. Then I 
presented mine.

“Erika, what do you want 

to be when you grow up?” my 
teacher asked. 

I showed the class my chart 

with a poorly drawn picture of 
camera and a typewriter.

“A screenwriter, and 

probably a director,” I 
answered. Nothing but blank 
stares greeted me.

Fifth grade came along, and 

we were learning fractions. 
While the other students took 
notes that would eventually 
lead them to be engineers or 
mathematicians, I was writing 
a 98-page screenplay about 
pirates. In other words, I was 
slowly but surely failing math.

Meeting with my fifth grade 

math teacher, she asked me 
why I was struggling with 
fractions. I was embarrassed, 
but I was also an innocent 

fifth grader who didn’t want 
to lie to my teacher. Ashamed 
and trembling, I opened my 
math notebook and showed her 
pages filled with indentations 
and words that were the 
beginnings of an amateur, 
handwritten screenplay. My 
teacher wasn’t all that upset — 
in fact, she smiled.

Since then, I have realized 

I should just do what I am 
good at. Clearly fractions 
were an essential compound 
to elementary education. 
However, I was more 
passionate writing about 
pirates fighting each other. 
I’ve learned from Sofia 
Coppola that even if you are 
a young neophyte, success is 
achievable, yet unmeasurable. 
I’ve learned that it’s OK to not 
follow the norm and to say 
that my dream is to win an 
Oscar award. I’ve learned that 
if I never watched the 2004 
Oscars, I don’t think I would 
have chosen to study a liberal 
arts major or a career path as 
a writer.

So here, I indirectly thank 

the Oscars for not only 
entertaining me for 13 years, 
but for also introducing me 
to the art of writing and film. 
This week, I’m sure to dig up 
my old screenplays, although 
they are so far from being 
finished. And just maybe, 
I will make it by the 100th 
anniversary of the Oscars. 

Meet your 2030 Best 
Screenplay winner

FILM NOTEBOOK

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

You would be hard pressed to 

find someone with an Internet 
connection that hasn’t heard that 
something is up with the Oscars. 
They’re white. Really, really 
white. The source and extent of 
the underrepresentation has been 
debated in think pieces from the 
New York Times to whatever “The 
Odyssey Online” is.

The Oscars disproportion-

ately favor white actors. That’s 
not really up for debate. But why 
are the Oscars the center of this 
conversation? Other award shows 
(namely the SAG Awards) award 
the actors of color that the Oscars 
snub. People are making movies 
about women and people of color, 
and the American public is paying 
to see them. Hollywood itself is 
pretty white, but not to the same 
extent as the 2016 Oscar nomi-
nees.

So, the question isn’t are the 

Oscars whitewashed, the question 
is do the Oscars even matter any-
more? Do award shows accurately 
reflect the culture of American 
moviegoers, or is the Academy 
detached enough from the box 
office to render itself insignifi-
cant?

There is an intense desire for 

representation in movies, and 
that has been made clear with 
the box office successes of movies 
like “Straight Outta Compton” 
and “Creed.” “The Force Awak-
ens,” far and away the highest 
grossing movie of the year, was 
led by Daisy Ridley (a woman!) 
and John Boyega (a Black actor!). 
Diversity exists onscreen. Movies 
can make money even when they 
aren’t about white men. But what 
separates these movies from their 
Oscar-nominated peers is their 

failure to live up to a certain old-
fashioned ideal of quality. They’re 
popular; they’re entertaining; 
they’re easy to watch. Therefore, 
they can’t be anything more than 
entertainment. They can’t be art.

Studios make a movie like “The 

Force Awakens” for very different 
reason than they make a movie 
like “Carol.” Both are great mov-
ies. “Carol” was made, more or 
less, to be placed on the podium 
alongside the other Oscar-nomi-
nated movies. “Carol” was made 
because it’s sad and it’s beautiful 
and the Academy eats that up. 
“The Force Awakens” was made to 
make money, and lots of it. It was 
made to entertain and engross 
the public. It was made to inspire 
the sales of merchandise. “The 
Force Awakens” and most of the 
racially diverse big studio movies 
of 2015 were made because they 
make money. They weren’t made 
to be “prestige pieces.” They 
weren’t made to be art.

Oscar nominations can be box 

office pushes for low-grossing 
movies. They steer movie snobs 
(like myself) toward films prom-
ised to be the crème de la crème. 
The Academy loves heavy period 
pieces, family dramas and any-
thing with a lone male hero who 
survives against all odds. Like the 
American public, the Academy 
likes to see itself in movies (see: 
“Birdman” or “The Artist”). The 
problem here is that, unlike the 
American public, the Academy is 
overwhelmingly white and male.

The makeup of the Academy 

clearly does not represent the 
American public, but perhaps 
it doesn’t want to. Perhaps, the 
Academy exists to represent Hol-
lywood. Demographically, the 
Academy represents the makeup 
of the writers, directors and pro-
ducers who make Oscar-winning 

movies. White men decide movies 
made by white men are the height 
of cinema. If the movies nomi-
nated for Oscars have a diversity 
problem, the people that made 
them have an even bigger one.

So why do people still care 

about the Oscars? Isn’t it enough 
that studios are making more and 
more movies with women and 
actors of color?

The Oscars do matter. Not 

because a golden statue can actu-
ally decide the “best” movie, 
actor, director, etc. of the year. 
Not because it matters if any one 
film or performance is better 
than another. The Oscars matter 
because they represent movie-
making on a larger scale. They 
stand as a symbol for what it 
means for a movie to be great, 
what it means for a movie to 
transcend commercial success 
and become something worth 
remembering.

So go ahead and get mad at the 

Oscars, but stay mad on February 
29. Stay mad on June 29 when 
the few diverse summer block-
busters are heralded as the end 
of underrepresentation in Hol-
lywood. Stay mad on November 
29th when studios roll out their 
next slew of whitewashed Oscar 
hopefuls. 

I’ll be watching the Oscars next 

Sunday. They’re going to be tense 
and they’re going to be awkward, 
but I’m hopeful that that ten-
sion and awkwardness will push 
moviemakers in the right direc-
tion. Normally I wouldn’t argue 
that award shows matter, but this 
year they do. Because this year 
they hold the potential to become 
more than just Hollywood patting 
itself on the back. This year the 
Oscars have the potential to be the 
springboard for real, necessary 
social change.

The all-white Oscars

T

he 
starving 
artist: 

one who sacrifices a 
comfortable 
lifestyle 

to 
invest 

their 
limited 
resources 
towards 
their art.

This 

could 
be 

anyone: 
visual art-
ists, liter-
ary artists, 
musicians, 
actors. People who trade mate-
rial comfort for a life devoted to 
their art.

This idea has got me thinking: 

How many artists or potential 
artists are out there who simply 
don’t create? Because they can’t. 
Because life with its stresses and 
burdens, has deprived them of the 
ability to design and shape art.

Or maybe life just deprived 

them of the incentive. I think 
there are plenty of people who 
have the talent, but have lost the 
motivation to share it.

On the flip side, how many 

people are out there who can-
not fathom giving up their art? 
Though by pursuing it, they may 
be signing off on a life of minimal 
income and minimal luxury, they 
cannot give it up.

The idea of the “starving artist” 

dates back to the mid-19th cen-
tury, when Henri Murger wrote 
a book titled: “Scenes de La Vie 
de Boheme” that discussed the 
lives of a group of French artists 
he lived among. Bohemians and 

their artistry became famous —
people wanted to dress like them 
and behave like them. In many 
ways, the life of an artist is still 
romanticized. But it isn’t neces-
sarily respected. 

Last year in one of my semi-

nars, one of our discussions led 
people to admit why they were 
studying their respective major. 
I remember one student bluntly 
admitted he was studying busi-
ness simply because he had no 
other choice. “My mom said it’s 
this, or I’m coming home and 
U of M is no longer in the pic-
ture.” I’m not entirely sure he has 
dreams of becoming an artist, 
and the life of business has led 
him astray. However, I do think 
there is something he loves more 
than what he is setting himself 
up to do for the remainder of his 
life. And for that, I think this 
problem is a relevant one.

The notion of the starving art-

ist highlights the divide between 
a life of limitations and a life of 
practicality. We are all set on this 
career-oriented way of thinking 
that drives us to see an appeal — 
and maybe even develop an obses-
sion — toward a life with security 
and purpose. As a result, we are 
left with this thought: art can’t get 
us there. Or at least, the chances 
of “making it” are low.

For those who choose to dis-

miss these worries and follow 
their art, they often face judg-
ment, which results in two very 
different reactions. They either 
1) reevaluate their art or 2) are 
even more encouraged to pur-
sue it, after seeing others’ doubt. 

Many become really fired up 
when someone questions some-
thing they love. Others take it as 
an indication that a life of security 
awaits them elsewhere and the 
best choice is to go find it.

Of course, there are artists who 

make it big. They are successful. 
They are admirable. They are 
the musicians who sell millions 
of albums, but admit their music 
started in their bedroom with an 
old guitar. Or the New York Times 
Bestsellers, who heard “NO” from 
so many publishers, until that one, 
wonderful “yes.” For the artists 
who aren’t sure whether or not 
it’s worth going on, they look to 
those who made it and they think, 
“They did it and so can I.” There 
it is. The life of the starving artist 
can’t die out — too many have sus-
tained their hope because of these 
examples.

So, do the people who show us 

the ideal product of our art fuel 
us? Or are we hindered by the 
people who question it?

Starving artists are every-

where. But I’d say there is an 
incredibly greater number of 
people who have given up and 
succumbed to the pressures of 
society because someone con-
vinced them that a life of stability 
is found elsewhere.

To you people out there who 

have lost the motivation to share 
your art — you should know that 
there are many of us in the world 
just starving to see it.

SINGLE REVIEW

 This February has been the 
time to be alive for indie rock/
emo/shoe-
gaze lovers 
everywhere. 
All of the 
sad boys are 
crawling 
out of their 
introverted 
online per-
sonas and 
are tweeting 
“#blessed.” 
The space goth girls are 
emerging from their black 
holes as they develop into 
their fan-girl alter egos. And 
this can all be blamed on the 
fact that not only has the lo-fi 
band Teen Suicide released a 
single, but their fellow emo/

indie cross friends, Pity Sex, 
have released a new song as 
well.
 Titled “Burden You,” Pity 
Sex’s new single does exactly 
that. Britty Drake’s soft voice 
cocoons your entire thought 
process and the only thing 
you can pay attention to is the 
music. The band attempts to 
pull off a shoegaze grunge 
sound and they do it so well 
with simple yet meaningful 
lyrics combined with dirty-
sounding bass lines all laced 
with some spacey guitar rifts.
 The lyrics in “Burden You” 
are delivered softly, but they 
slowly creep into your head 
and create a tunnel connect-
ing to your heart. Britty Drake 
sings about young love and 

inside the simple lyrics she 
gives you everything you’ve 
ever wanted. She addresses 
unrequited love, confusion, 
regret and the want to feel 
wanted in a way that’s not 
extremely cliche. Drake sings 
in a way that feels personal, 
like she’s whispering in your 
ear. Hearing her sing the lyr-
ics “I’ll always think of your 
lips when I’m moving mine 
against his. I wanna know, I 
wanna know that I’m running 
in your mind also, don’t let me 
go,” puts your heart in your 
stomach and fills your lungs 
with flowers.
 “Burden You” creates a 
sadness that never felt so 
good.

Ethan and 

Hila Klein are 

relationship goals

By JACOB RICH

Senior Arts Editor

They met on Birthright.
He was a Jewish-American kid 

with a quick sense of humor and 
a bit of a belly. She was a charm-
ing, shy Israeli taking a week off 
of her required military service. 
They didn’t hook up, but they hit 
it off — they spent the whole week 
of their trip talking and laughing. 
When he got back to the United 
States, an e-mail from her was 
waiting for him. A year later, she 
left her homeland to be with him 
in the sunny city of Santa Cruz, 
and they’ve been inseparable ever 
since.

Now, eight years later, Ethan 

and Hila Klein are YouTube’s ris-
ing power couple. H3h3Produc-
tions, their comedy channel, has 
nearly 1 million subscribers and 
over 100 million video views, 
about a quarter of which (accord-
ing to SocialBlade) happened in 
the last month. To say their work 
is blowing up would be a huge 
understatement. Lately, their new 
videos have been routinely voted 
to the number one position on 
Reddit’s video aggregate site r/
videos, while more and more big 
YouTubers are giving the couple 
shout-outs on Twitter and on their 
own channels.

It’s almost impossible to sum-

marize 
what 
h3h3Productions 

videos are generally like. In recent 
months, they’ve been all over the 
place, from elaborately edited 
“.exe” videos to rants to comedy 
essays to skits. I guess you could 
think of them as somewhere 
between Adult Swim’s “Tim and 
Eric” and “Mystery Science The-
ater 3000” — irreverent, surreal 
and charmingly lo-fi.

But what really put h3h3Pro-

ductions on the map were their 
“reaction” videos. On first glance, 
they just look like any other video 
response on YouTube — Hila holds 
the camera, while Ethan talks into 
it as he buffers through a video. But 
h3h3Productions is much more 
than just an exploitative commen-
tary on popular videos. Their reac-
tions blur the lines between satire 
and skit, comedy and tragedy. The 
second their catchy ’80s-tinged 
intro song ends, you know you’re 
in for genius improvisation and 
weird, uncomfortable video edit-
ing. It’s avant-garde digital com-
edy at its most bizarre.

The reaction videos started in 

2013 when Ethan saw “Girls who 

Read,” a pretentious video slam 
poem making the rounds on Red-
dit.

The poem, presented by a 

chubby British guy, posits the 
author as a classy gentleman who 
prefers a woman’s intellect to 
her “tits or ass” — well, as long as 
they’re drop-dead gorgeous like 
the actress in the video. Ethan was 
infuriated by the poem’s hypoc-
risy. I have to agree — that video 
sucks. It’s a stunning example of 
male superficiality and the double 
standards set for women. 

Hila grabbed her camera and 

got to work. 

“Now look at this chubby little 

hunk here,” Ethan says, pointing 
to an overweight girl in the cor-
ner of the video’s frame. “If she’s 
over there reading books, I bet he’s 
not making this poetic little video 
about her. I bet she could be smart 
as fuck. No, he chooses the CUTE 
girl who reads.”

Since then, the couple has 

applied their unique formula to 
dozens of cringe-worthy, obnox-
ious and toxic targets on You-
Tube. They were among the first 
to point out the bizarre, embar-
rassing eccentricities of recording 
artist DJ Khaled, the exploitative 
immorality of YouTube’s “urban 
pranksters” and the uncomfort-
able sexual overtones of the oh-so-
fake “kissing prank.”

Ethan and Hila’s videos each 

have an unmistakable look to 
them, thanks to the couple’s 
unique and outrageous style. 
They’ve 
become 
somewhat 

famous for their thrift-shop cou-
ture — beanie caps, turtlenecks, 
sunglasses and what Ethan calls 
the “Chub ‘n’ Tuck” (the act of 
tucking high-waisted sweatpants 
under one’s gut) are all essential 
aspects of the charming h3h3Pro-
ductions aesthetic. Further amp-
ing up the couple’s lovable style 
is Hila’s art, which is often on 
display in the background of the 
reactions. 
Her 
neon-drenched 

surrealist brushstrokes fit in per-
fectly with their offbeat dress.

The 
first 
h3h3Productions 

video I saw was “The Tai Lopez 
Conspiracy,” an absolutely savage 
comedic takedown of the “here in 
my garage” guy (you know the ad, 
he’s the get-rich-quick salesman 
that shows you his Lamborghini 
and lectures you on the impor-
tance of “KNAWledge”).

The video was a rollercoaster 

of emotions to say the very least. 
It started out simple enough, 
with Ethan taking jabs at Lopez’s 
meme-worthy speech patterns. 
This wouldn’t be nearly as funny 
if Ethan didn’t have the per-
fect satirical tone. While many 
of h3h3Productions’s reactions 
are certainly condemning, they 

almost never feel mean-spirited. 
It’s a testament to the guy’s come-
dic instincts that he can toe the 
line of, in his own words, “Goo-
fin’ and Gaffin’ ” on others’ videos 
without resorting to bullying.

Soon, things got crazy. Sud-

denly, Ethan was convulsing on 
his chair like in “2001: A Space 
Odyssey” while frightening, clum-
sily edited fake ads of Lopez’s face 
surrounded Ethan’s and a bright 
yellow “TRIGGERED” sign rose 
from the bottom of the screen. I 
laughed so hard I almost dropped 
my laptop.

But then, the tone changed 

again. After some quick Google 
sleuthing, Ethan was able to reveal 
that Lopez’s luxurious Hollywood 
Hills mansion wasn’t, in fact, 
owned by Lopez at all — it was a 
short-term rental, easily available 
for cheap film shoots via a website. 
All of a sudden, Ethan’s video felt 
more like muckraking journalism 
rather than a bizarro-comedy.

Of late, it seems like h3h3Pro-

ductions’ videos have taken on 
this journalistic role more often. 
As cheesy as it sounds, Ethan and 
Hila have almost become Inter-
net detectives. They certainly 
haven’t removed themselves from 
comedy, but exposing shady busi-
ness practices, dumb clickbait 
and harmful, obnoxious “pranks” 
has become an essential aspect of 
their videos. In 2016, their most 
popular videos have been on their 
very public feud with SoFloAnto-
nio, a profiteer who illegally steals 
other creators’ YouTube and Vine 
videos and uploading them onto 
his ultra-popular Facebook page, 
“SoFlo.” One of h3h3Produc-
tions’ SoFlo videos even features 
a straight-up investigative inter-
view between Ethan and a content 
creator whose video Antonio stole 
and profited off.

This, and Ethan’s rant about the 

terrible business practices of the 
litigious Fine Brothers have pro-
vided tent poles under which You-
Tube’s creators can stand together 
— their anti-corporation, pro-cre-
ator rhetoric has clearly resonated 
with the Internet.

There’s a reason h3h3Produc-

tions has an enormous fan base, 
their own thriving subreddit and 
a Patreon pulling in nearly $5,000 
a month. They represent a chal-
lenge to the status quo. They’re 
changing the terms of what can 
be done with YouTube comedy, 
one video at a time. This is really 
hilarious stuff, people. And by act-
ing as a last bastion for the ethical 
creator, they’ve managed to rally 
those who believe in YouTube as a 
medium of quality entertainment. 
The Internet is h3h3Productions’ 
oyster, and I can’t wait to see what 
happens next. 

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 As well known as FKA twigs 

may be for visually striking, 
otherworldly 
music videos, 
“Good to Love” 
is remarkably 
minimalist. It’s 
just her, a bed 
and a camera. 
The degree 
to which she 
can stretch 
this medium 
speaks to the artistry of twigs, 
not only as a singer and a dancer, 
but as a director as well.

For its minimalism, twigs still 

manages to bring an ethereal 
quality to this video. The sheets 
seem alive as they’re pulled and 
tossed, and clever camerawork 
blurs the line between skin and 
cloth. It’s a powerful reflection 
of her music, acutely preoc-
cupied with lust and love. Her 
muses, however, are always 
peripheral. “Good to Love” is 
no doubt a plea to a lover, but 
it’s twigs who is center stage. 
Everything here is by her, for 
her, of her. It’s a solo sex scene 
on her own terms.

The most consuming part of 

this video — and all of her videos 
— is of course twigs herself, spe-
cifically her movements. They’re 
startlingly deliberate, yet still 
feel organic. She resembles a 
marionette as she throws her-
self around with the sheets. As 
the camera moves to her face, 
we get a flush of deep emotion 
with only a glance of the eyes. 
The result is a video that says a 
lot with a little. twigs might be 
a “sweet little lover maker,” but 
she has some big ideas.

“The Graduate” 

in this series, three daily arts writers in 

varying states of mind do the same activity 

and write about their experiences.

this week’s event:

Part 1: “The bathrooms down at the end of the hall,” I feel like this means something intense. Also s/o 

to Ms. Robinson for fucking inventing the term MILF. MRS ROBINSON YOU’RE TRYING TO SEDUCE 
ME. Every god damn line in this movie is beautiful. On a side note why do they make this pathetic dude 
out to be a track star newspaper editor straight A student I’m not feeling like this man is all those things.

 Part 2: Ben, you’ll never be young again. The one-liners in this film are changing. Every damn 

line has a profound effect on the total course of my life. I’m just worried about my future. 

Buzzed wonders how the filmmakers made this underwater diver scene and now 

I’m questioning how they make any scene. Or anything. Ha. Hoffman just 

walked into the hotel for an affair and it’s similarly life changing. Mrs. 

Robinson is the kind of forward woman I need in my life. That 

would definitely be life changing. Oh my god who is this 

woman and does she actually exist. I need to date 

older women. Not older like “oh she’s like 

21” older like “she’s married with two 

kids.” Wait that sounds a little 
Freudian shit that was bad.

Part 3: I wonder if the same 

situation played out in 2016 if it would 

play out the same. Are we at a point in society 

where we can accept a man having a casual 

relationship with his girlfriend’s mother, have we finally 

gotten to that point America? God. We need Bernie at a time 

like this. Which brings me to the point that Bored pointed out — he 

could have been an extra in this. The man was as young and able in 1967 as 

he is in 2016. Wow.

Part 4: The vibe of the landlord in Berkeley is great. He’s probably the most stable 

character in this movie, which must stand for something. And now Kate Moss just comes 

in and screams her head off in the most terrifying shot I’ve seen in years. She sounds like she’s 

dying but she really is just upset at something so small and insignificant as Dustin Hoffman having an 

affair with her 45+ year old mother. That’s such a big deal. Children are starving in Africa dammit. And 
now Hoffman wants to marry this poor girl. The emotional strain must be a lot, so I apologize to Kate. 
But now she’s agreed to marry him so I guess that means it’s probably not that bad.

Part 5: This may be entirely unrelated to this movie, but every time I see this movie I want to move 

somewhere west of Texas. That just seems like an entirely different style of living, an entirely new 
atmosphere of life. Imagine waking up in Denver, Colorado. How would who I am and what I stand for 
change. Coming for you, Denver.

Part 6: The movie’s over: (add spoiler here). The Sound of Silence again coming in and changing my 

existence. And that last shot is so perfectly done that I think I am yet again: changed. Buzzed says it’s 
about the banality of life and that alters the world for about the 20th time this evening. But it’s ok. After 
this I can get some food.

-Daily Arts Writer

Here is a just a stream of thought: The beginning of this film 

is so brilliant – it’s not really iconic as it is unnerving in a 

really friendly way. Like, everyone is being so nice to 

him but it’s terrifying. I never want to grow up.

This plastics line works so well.

I see so much of myself in Dustin Hoffman, 

except the whole older-woman-seductress-
attraction part, but I guess it’s something to 
aspire to.

The Robinsons’ mini-bar has a little orb that 

says “BAR” on it, like I didn’t know it was a 
bar. Come on!

This song that Mrs. Robinson plays is HOT.
“Did you know I was an alcoholic?” *Gasp* 

“What?”
The iconic scene “are you trying to seduce me” is 

the PERFECT scene for 1967. Braddock comes to the 

conclusion that Mrs. Robinson is trying to seduce him, she 

says she’s not, but of course she is. Mike Nichols must have 

been slapped down a ton between “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” and 

“The Graduate,” with studio folks telling him that he’s ruining film but NO he was transforming it.

Ben Braddock’s reactions to Mrs. Robinson in the whole initial interaction are priceless. He’s got 

such a command on whimpers and little cries, it’s fantastic.

10 years before Darth Vader, we had Benjamin Braddock. His breathing during the scuba scene is 

wonderful. It’s like he’s really heavily sighing with disdain at how dumb this gift is.

“Are you here for an affair, sir?” “Huh?” “The Singleman party?” “Ah yes”
Benjamin Braddock has got to be a stand-in for baby-boomers and just discovering how messed up 

life is with his discovering how disastrous the Robinson family is—Mr. and Mrs. Robinson don’t sleep 
together, they got married because she got pregnant, she got a degree in art but lost her interest, and, 
of course, the whole Elaine plotline.

Fun fact: Katharine Ross is married to SAM ELLIOTT. I wish I were married to Sam Elliott. 

Seems like such a cool dude. Oh, they’re making out, but she was just crying. Do you think Bernie 
Sanders is an extra in this movie? This is not Berkeley. This is USC. Choose a less iconic building. 
Richard Dreyfuss! I love Richard Dreyfuss. Elaine making moves! Part of me is doubtful that a 
person like Dustin Hoffman could ever pull this all off and then part of me feels ashamed that I 
would ever doubt Dustin Hoffman.

I love Dustin Hoffman.
This montage of Benjamin trying to find where the wedding will take place is so great, fueled by 

that great Mrs. Robinson soundtrack.

And of course, THIS FINAL SCENE IS GLORIOUS. In the words of Baked, this is such a hippie 

movie. They’re just flipping off authority and society. But of course, it ends with sadness. Oh well, we 
all die.

- Daniel Hensel

This is the third night in a row I’ve gotten drunk, and 

it’s the weekend before midterm week. My jewish parents 
are rolling in their graves, but they’re still alive. Is it bad 
for to get crossfaded for these? I hope not. This movie is 
absolutely amazing. That intro sequence though. I’m really 
feeling the existential ennui right now. Mrs. Robinson is 
such a babe. We just looked it up, and this movie made 
SO much fucking money. Dustin Hoffman is so fucking 
perfectly awkward. How’d you even do this? God, four 
loko qSA A bad choice. The single fame boob gets me every 
time, so funny, “Oh jesus Christ.” I really want to stop 
drinking this four loko. Anne Bancroft is like a soulless 
husk. She reminds me of my exes badum chhhhhhhh

Whoops I just told Danny what’s going on in my 

personal life. That’s okay, that guy’s alright. RUSHMORE 
(that was the devin faraci style, fucking deal with it 
EDITORS) totally ripped this part in the pool off. I want 
to work for Vulture if you’re reading this, fucking give me 
an internship you motherfuckers. Fyck you. This movie is 
just like, human beings are disgusting. I’m embarrassed at 
how drunk I am. Good thing we’re all going to die and life 
has no point, the central thesis of this movie and my life.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

The musical TV genre has 

experienced a massive creative 
growth recently. The relaunch of 
the genre started out with “Glee” 
in 2009, which used pop songs 
to tell its story. The show was a 
massive success for FOX in its 
first season, but it never really 
found an ability to tell its story 
through song. Then “Smash” 
arrived onto the scene, bringing 
in a mix of contemporary pop 
and original content. The show 
was touted as the next big hit by 
NBC when it premiered, but it 
never connected with the public, 
not lasting past its second season. 
Then along came “Galavant” and 
“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” which 
have tiny viewerships, but are 
two of the best out there right 
now.

This leads to the question: 

is there something inherently 
limiting, from an audience per-
spective, about musical television 
shows? If so, that’s really disap-
pointing, because both “Gala-
vant” and “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” 
are brilliantly inventive, using 
their songs to tell their story in 
new ways.

Something astonishing hap-

pened during the second season 
of “Galavant.” The show elevated 
itself from a cheap musical I’d 
watch out of respect for the 
format to something fun and 
unique. Most of that change 
came from the music itself. In the 
first season, the songs told jokes, 
but they didn’t lead anywhere 
for the stories or the characters. 
Composer Alan Menken (who 
wrote the music for many of 
Disney’s ’90s musicals) expanded 
the scope of the songs, using 
them to address both humor and 
character growth. In the second 
season, the show lost its fear of 
advancing its characters through 
song. A moment in the show’s 
finale comes to mind. King 
Richard (Timothy Omundson, 
“Psych”) meets his “inner-child” 

in a song addressing his hopes 
and fears. He sings: “Will my 
star ever rise? / Will my life ever 
change? / Am I destined to be 
achievement-free forever?” This 
type of self-reflection through 
song is something the show 
would never have attempted in 
its first season, and shows a lot of 
growth on the show’s part.

Some of the songs end up 

in full-fledged parody. A song 
where Galavant (Joshua Sasse, 
“The Neighbors”) tries to set the 
mood for a date between Richard 
and Roberta (Clare Foster, “The 
Bill”) reminds me of a classic 
“Little Mermaid” tune, though 
its refrain of “Maybe you won’t 
die alone” is slightly different 
from “Kiss the Girl.” And one 
scene involving Richard and 
Roberta sharing the story of first 
sexual encounter to their zombie 
army features a similar tune to 
“Grease” ’s “Summer Nights,” 
complete with zombie grunts 
filling for in for the greasers’ 
responses.

“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” is also 

pushing the musical-comedy 
boundary, using music to deal 
with some of the show’s deeper 
themes surrounding mental ill-
ness. During the series, there are 
a few moments where Rebecca 
(Rachel Bloom, “Fuck Me Ray 
Bradbury”), the show’s main 
character who moves to West 
Covina, CA to follow her former 
summer-camp boyfriend Josh 
Chan (Vincent Rodriguez III, 
“Hostages”), is upset because of 
something Josh did, and each of 
these moments features a song. 
The first, “Sexy French Depres-
sion,” puts Rebecca’s feelings 
front and center with a scene that 
uses berets and a black and white 
aesthetic. The second, from the 
latest episode, when Rebecca’s 
lies catch up to her and push Josh 
away, features Rebecca singing 
“You ruined everything, you 
stupid bitch / You’re just a lying 
little bitch who ruins things and 
wants the world to burn.” It’s 
heartbreaking to watch her bash 

herself like this, but it’s a beauti-
ful way to illustrate the impact of 
the moment.

“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” also 

does something the best musi-
cals do: use its music to address 
character relationships. In a 
scene from earlier in the season, 
Josh addresses Rebecca after a 
moment of contention between 
her and the rest of the group, and 
the two share a reprise of “West 
Covina” where the two affirm 
their friendship. It’s a moment 
that only a musical could do, put-
ting two voices in tight harmony.

But I don’t want to discount 

the success of live musical 
broadcasts from NBC and FOX, 
which have been big fat hits for 
the networks, and pretty damn 
good as well. Those events are 
better able to draw an audience 
because the networks can push 
them as happening live. They 
also utilize big industry names 
who probably wouldn’t commit 
to a full series.

Still, despite all the warm 

critical reception of these new 
musicals, neither of the continu-
ing series is likely to see another 
year. “Galavant” ’s big supporter, 
Paul Lee, was just fired from 
his position as ABC’s President 
of Entertainment, and the rat-
ings for its recent run were just 
abysmal. And less than a million 
people watched the premiere 
of “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” with 
little growth in DVR views. That 
signifies one of two things: either 
viewers didn’t find the show or 
just outright rejected it.

That’s such a sad thing for me. 

People will watch the live broad-
casts of known musicals, but they 
either can’t find or won’t watch 
the weekly series. This is an 
unfortunate situation, because 
both the shows are using songs 
to tell stories in ways that other 
series just can’t. They’re explor-
ing new ways of advancing story 
and character through their orig-
inal music, and it’s a shame that 
they probably won’t be able to tell 
these stories for much longer.

TV NOTEBOOK

EPISODE REVIEW

This season of “Shameless” 

launches the Gallagher family 
into new 
territory. 
The family’s 
dynamic has 
always been 
at the core of 
the show, but 
it approaches 
a turning 
point now 
that the kids 
are grown 
up (with 
the exception of Liam). Fiona 
(Emmy Rossum, “The Day After 
Tomorrow”) must cope with 
her siblings’ resistance to being 
told what to do, and she seems to 
lose her sense of purpose in the 
transition.

The episode “Pimp’s 

Paradise” shows the calm before 
the storm. After getting evicted 
when their house is foreclosed, 
the Gallaghers navigate a series 
of hurdles to regain ownership of 
their home. They hope to return 
to a sense of normalcy, when 
their lives aren’t getting torn 
apart by drugs, jail or romantic 
strife.

This is normalcy for the 

Gallaghers: Liam getting 
lice, Debbie (Emma Kenney, 
“Epic”) seducing her employer 
recovering from cancer, 
Lip (Jeremy Allen White, 
“Afterschool”) getting his 
professor fired after nude 
pictures of her are leaked from 
his phone and Carl (Ethan 
Cutosky, “The Unborn”) using 
his (likely) drug money to pimp 
out their house with a slide and 
DJ booth.

As the family’s individual 

subplots drift further apart 

from one another, the episode 
struggles to reincorporate the 
driving element of the show’s 
drama: Frank (William H. Macy, 
“Fargo”), the only character 
who never changes. His attempt 
to reclaim his status as head of 
the household prompts Fiona to 
throw in the towel and move in 
with Sean (Dermot Mulroney, 
“The Grey”). With Fiona’s 
history of doomed relationships 
and Frank’s pattern of flighty 
opportunism, another upheaval 
is bound to hit soon.

D

ear Gillian,

Sometimes it feels 

like 
I’m 
constantly 

‘looking for love.’ However, I have 
lost 
sight 

of 
what 

that truly 
means. In 
this 
day 

filled with 
Tinder, 
hookup 
culture 
and 
increased 
sexuality, 
how 
can 

I look for 
love with all this sex in the way? 
Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t 
turn down the opportunity for 
sex but I often feels like it gets in 
the way of finding a relationship. 
I’ve never been good at finding 
the love part, and the sex part 
just seems to complicate it for 
me. I desire both but one seems 
like an immediate gratification 
and the other seems like exit 
out of a long complicated maze. 
Please send me advice on how to 
navigate between desire for sex 
and longing for love. Are they 
mutually exclusive? Is it possible 
to be on the hunt for sex and find 
love along the way? Or do I have 
this whole thing upside down? 
Please help.

— Lovelorn and Lonely
Dear Lovelorn and Lonely,
People 
have 
been 
sitting 

around musing on the topic of 
what love and sex do to and for 
each other since Eryximachus 
proposed that for the post-
feast entertainment in Plato’s 
“Symposium,” everyone should 
belt out a little oration in praise 
of Eros, the god of love. This 
wine-fueled series of exegeses 
on the subject yielded some 
thought-provoking 
opinions 

that have stood the test of time. 
But they were so wide-ranging 
that the only conclusion from 
them is that there is no coherent 
consensus on the topic, one 
which is destined to dominate 
everyone’s little black book of 
eternal mysteries of human 
existence.

Plato — well, the words of the 

prophetess 
Diotima 
through 

Socrates’ speech — posits that 
the erotic desire of romantic 
love cannot be satisfied by sex 
and is really an existential 
yearning to transcend our own 
beings and mortality. Exactly 
what you have in mind every 
time you bring someone home, 
right?

Then there’s Aristophanes’ 

creation myth of primordial 
beings with two bodies in one 
before they were split in half 
by the gods, leaving a world 
of “individuals” trying to fuse 
back together with their other 
halves. This stands now, 2500 

years later, as not only one of 
the most striking metaphors on 
the topic, but also as a bountiful 
source of pickup lines at Rick’s. 

The mystery was not solved 

by Xenophon’s response to Plato 
(also titled “Symposium”), nor 
in the many Symposia since. 
Heaven knows that in the 
Symposium held at my house 
last year featuring History Prof. 
David Halperin’s students in 
togas, the love/sex mystery was 
hopelessly 
compounded 
and 

shrouded in a dense enigmatic 
fog that, for many of us, has yet 
to lift.

A 
little 
later, 
Aristotle 

maintains 
in 
his 
“Prior 

Analytics” that erotic desire is 
actually more a desire for love 
than it is a desire for sexual 
intercourse. 
If 
Aristotle’s 

on to something and love is 
actually the aim of sex, why is 
it often so detached and void of 
emotion or commitment? And if 
it’s not for love, what is it for? 
That’s the question Halperin 
will take up in a forthcoming 
article “What is Sex For?” in 
which he will attempt to tie this 
Aristotelian paradox into the 
no-less-mysterious topics of gay 
bathhouses and Adele.

Since figuring out what sex is 

for seems doomed, do we have 
a better chance with love? We 
turn to essayist Susan Sontag, 
who managed to demystify the 
art of photography and then 
took on the question what is 
love for. “We ask everything of 
love. We ask it to be anarchic. 
We ask it to be the glue that 
holds the family together, that 
allows society to be orderly 
and allows all kinds of material 
processes to be transmitted 
from one generation to another. 
But I think that the connection 
between love and sex is very 
mysterious.” 
Thanks 
a 
lot. 

Sontag 
continues: 
“Part 
of 

the modern ideology of love 
is to assume that love and sex 
always go together. They can, 
I suppose, but I think rather 
to the detriment of either one 
or the other. And probably the 
greatest problem for human 
beings is that they just don’t.” 
Well, Lovelorn, at least you’re in 
good company.

But 
let’s 
move 
up 
from 

philosophy and intellectualism 
to the arts, which, I believe, 
are better at eternal mysteries. 
There’s a film from 1971 called 
“Carnal 
Knowledge,” 
from 

the Jules Feiffer novel, in 
which Jack Nicholson and Art 
Garfunkel meet as freshmen 
roommates at Amherst. In terms 
of your letter, LL, Nicholson’s 
character can be said to be sex 
and Garfunkel’s, love. The film 
follows them through their 
lives, and although there are 
many lovely insights and some 

great lines, by the end, the 
question of which one fared 
better is … you guessed it, a 
mystery.

Some have weighed in on the 

relative merits of love and sex, 
elevating one above the other. 
 

Plato and Aristotle saw love as 
the higher pursuit. Freud saw 
sex is primary, driving virtually 
everything we do, and love as 
just one of many constructs we 
use to get more sex. In her novel 
“Love,” Toni Morrison explored 
infatuation, a kind of half-sex-
half-love minotaur:

“Do 
they 
still 
call 
it 

infatuation? That magic ax that 
chops away the world in one 
blow, leaving only the couple 
standing 
there 
trembling? 

Whatever they call it, it leaps 
over anything, takes the biggest 
chair, the largest slice, rules 
the ground wherever it walks, 
from a mansion to a swamp, and 
its selfishness is its beauty ... 
People with no imagination feed 
it with sex — the clown of love. 
They don’t know the real kinds, 
the better kinds, where losses 
are cut and everybody benefits. 
It takes a certain intelligence to 
love like that — softly, without 
props.”

Looking at history, I don’t 

think our world of dating sites, 
apps and i-things has yielded 
an era of more sex and less love. 
But I do think they have made 
finding and losing sex and love 
more impersonal and reduced 
our accountability for how we 
carry ourselves in doing so. 
This may be pushing sex and 
romantic love further from each 
other and I think this is what 
you are sensing, Lovelorn.

Yet there’s no correct recipe 

for finding genuine love, as 
Stendahl illustrates in his novel 
“The Red and the Black,” which 
locates love in the spontaneity 
of the moment and not the 
strategic love games of jealousy, 
drama and roles.

So 
with 
no 
formula 
or 

equation for solving for love 
with the variable of sex, I hope 
I’ve been able to prove you are 
not alone in feeling your way 
through the complicated maze 
of yours. No, the two pursuits 
are not mutually exclusive, but 
no one’s been able to calculate a 
correlation coefficient.

I’m looking for love, 
but just finding sex

JAKAB

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

Daily Arts Writer

During 
the 
classical 
film 

era, theorists grappled over 
the importance of shooting on 
location. Those who encouraged 
it claimed that it evoked a layer 
of depth unmatched by the 
sentiments the actors produced 
when recording on a sound stage. 
This was extremely critical for 
“Rome, Open City,” where the 
suffering emitted by the people 
lining the decimated streets of 
Italy constantly reminded the 
actors of the brokenness their 
characters felt and enhanced the 
emotional authenticity. Others 
argued that it didn’t matter 
where the film was shot as long 
as the director could convince 
his audience that the story took 
place in the exact location that 
he told them it did. Nowadays, 
few directors prioritize filming 
on-site, as audiences willingly 
accept 
the 
idea 
of 
feigned 

locations.

To 
disguise 
one 
city 
as 

another, 
directors 
carefully 

select 
indistinguishable 
areas 

to shoot their films in addition 
to 
employing 
other 
creative 

techniques. For example, “The 
5th Wave” is set in Cincinnati, 
Ohio, yet it was shot in Macon, 
Georgia 
though 
it’s 
almost 

impossible to tell since the tall 
trees and dirt covered ground 
make 
the 
woodland 
setting 

appear like the forest you’d 
expect to see in Ohio. There’s also 
a clever shot of a sign indicating 
how many miles the heroine 
must travel until she reaches 
the Wright-Patterson Air Force 
Base, which is located in Dayton, 
Ohio. So, although the movie 
itself was far from believable, I 
was thoroughly convinced that 
the action happened in the exact 
location that I was informed it 
did. 

However, for Ohio residents, 

this effect may not have been 
achieved. To locals, it doesn’t 
matter how average the forest, or 
how many cutaways to city limit 
signs the director uses, they will 
always be able to discern that it’s 
their city. My familiarity with 
Grand 
Rapids 
unfortunately 

led to a state of temporarily 
disillusionment. 
I 
vividly 

remember the morning I learned 
that Jessie Eisenberg and Jason 
Segel were downtown shooting 
“The End of the Tour.” In that 
moment, I felt a sense of pride 
knowing that my hometown was 
going to be featured on the big 
screen. Sadly, this exhilaration 
subsided once I actually watched 
the film.

Initially, 
it 
was 
exciting 

to hear the little voice in my 
head 
exclaim 
“I’ve 
walked 

past that” (the office building 
at 50 Monroe Avenue), “I’ve 
seen 
that 
restaurant,” 
“I’ve 

driven on that stretch of I-196” 

and “I think I’ve actually been 
inside that building.” But, this 
also emphasized that the story 
isn’t 
actually 
unfolding 
in 

Bloomington, Illinois. Now this is 
not to say that I didn’t thoroughly 
enjoy “The End of the Tour,” just 
that I became frustrated with its 
lack of genuineness.

With a much bigger production, 

“Batman V Superman: Dawn 
of Justice,” having been shot in 
Detroit, it will be interesting to 
see if Michiganders will notice 
any familiar buildings or streets. 
Typically, 
the 
background 

tends to lose its significance 
in films dominated by special 
effects, 
computer 
graphics 

and 
fight 
scenes 
whereas 

in 
calmer, 
narrative-driven 

features such as “Tour,” the 
characters’ interaction with their 
environment is salient.

While in the early days of 

cinema, all elements equally 
determined a film’s success, 
contemporary 
Hollywood 

heavily depends on acting and 
post production work. Audiences 
have come to rely on movies for 
a 
complete 
manipulation 
of 

reality, not a beautiful recreation 
of it. Thus, the importance 
of 
on-location 
shooting 
has 

sadly 
diminished. 
But 
this 

strategy cannot be completely 
neglected, especially when its 
absence can prevent the viewer 
from 
completely 
engrossing 

themselves in the film.
