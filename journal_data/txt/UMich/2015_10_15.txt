CAMPUS LIFE

During conversation, 
participants react 
to recent shootings 
on college campuses

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

The issue of mass violence 

drove the conversation Tuesday 
during an open discussion about 
a topic people are grappling 
with nationwide: gun control on 
college campuses. 

Hosted 
by 
students 
from 

the Student Engagement Team 
within the University’s Program 
on Intergroup Relations, the 
event aimed to brainstorm the 
causes of mass violence in the 
United States in light of recent 
shootings at college campuses 
in Roseburg, Ore. and Flagstaff, 
Ariz.

Members of IGR first asked 

students to reflect on how they 
were 
personally 
affected 
by 

others having guns.

During the event, which The 

Michigan Daily was asked not to 
record to provide a safe space for 
dialogue, one student said while 
they weren’t comfortable with 
guns, they believed there was a 
dissidence between people who 
rely on guns for protection and 
people who have guns for the sole 
purpose of killing and causing 
harm.

In an interview with the 

Daily 
after 
the 
event, 
LSA 

sophomore 
Gloriela 
Iguina-

Colon, a co-student engagement 
coordinator, said part of the issue 
is that guns are often associated 
with having power.

“In my group, we talked about 

the intersection of showing and 
displaying power through guns 
and masculinity in our culture,” 
she said. “I think that’s a really 
important thing to address so we 
can redefine what it means to be 
masculine and to be strong.”

A portion of the event was 

also 
dedicated 
to 
discussing 

how dominant ideologies and 
beliefs within American culture

Program announces 
highest application 

rates since 1975 

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

For most University students, 

the story is well known. On an 
October night in 1960, then-
Senator John F. Kennedy stood 

on the Michigan Union’s steps 
and challenged students to serve 
their country by volunteering 
abroad. The idea led to the 
creation of the Peace Corps.

University 
administrators 

joined Peace Corps director 
Carrie 
Hessler-Radelet 
on 

those 
same 
steps 
Tuesday 

to 
commemorate 
Kennedy’s 

historic speech. At the event, 
Hessler-Radelet 
announced 

the Peace Corps had received 

the 
highest 
number 
of 

applicants 
since 
1975. 
She 

said the Peace Corps received 
23,000 applications this year, a 
32-percent increase in applicants 
from the previous year.

“What 
these 
application 

numbers tell us is that Americans 
today 
are 
as 
passionate 

about service as they have 
ever been, and that they are 
clamoring for the opportunity 
to make sustainable change in 

communities around the world,” 
Hessler-Radelet said. “Today’s 
Americans, from all walks of 
life, are ready to put their skills 
to work making a difference and 
when given the opportunity to 
make their mark on the world, 
they will raise their hands to 
serve in record numbers.”

in the Peace Corps in Western 
Samoa from 1981 to 1983 before

POLICY

Professors discuss 
poverty, welfare in 
the United States 

By CHARLOTTE JENKINS

Daily Staff Reporter

Living on $2.00 a day may 

sound difficult, but it’s a reality 
for many Americans.

Kathryn Edin, a professor of 

sociology and public health at 
Johns Hopkins University, and 
H. Luke Shaefer, a public policy 
and social work professor at 
the University, discussed their 
recently released book, “$2.00 a 
Day: Living on Almost Nothing 
in America.”

The event was hosted by 

the Ford School of Public 
Policy and co-sponsored by the 
National Poverty Center and 
the University’s School of Social 
Work.

Public Policy Dean Susan 

Collins introduced the authors, 

noting that poverty in the 
United States is increasing. 
She said the current number of 
people living below the federal 
poverty line, which is set at 
$24,250 for a family of four, is 
striking and warrants attention.

Edin described how she 

became interested in families 
who live essentially without 
cash when she visited a woman 
at home named Ashley during 
the course of another research 
project. Ashley had recently 
given birth, and was visibly 
unkempt, 
depressed 
and 

struggling to physically hold 
her child.

At the end of the interview, 

Edin paid Ashley the required 
agreed-upon 
$50 
for 
her 

participation in Edin’s research 
study, and returned to Ashley’s 
home the next day to find her 
transformed. Ashley had gotten 
her hair styled, was wearing a 
new pantsuit and was on the 
way to a job interview. Edin

RESEARCH

University study may 
help doctors better 
treat mental illness

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

The way individuals perceive 

their own mental health can 
differ by ethnicity, according to a 
new University study.

Conducted by the University’s 

School of Public Health and the 
Department of Psychiatry, the 
study found that when African 
American and Afro-Caribbean 
communities were evaluated for 
anxiety and depression, the two 
groups had different ideas of what 
constituted a mental health issue.

Shervin Assari, research fellow 

in the Department of Psychiatry 
and lead author of the study, said 
in some groups, certain mental 
health 
disorders 
have 
more 

significance than in others.

‘I’m Shmacked’ to 
film in Ann Arbor

PanHell to pilot 
risk management 
programs Saturday

By EMMA KERR

Daily Staff Reporter

“I’m Schmacked” — a film crew 

dedicated to producing videos that 

glorify college party culture and 
often garner millions of views — is 
coming to campus Saturday. 

The video series will feature the 

University’s party scene for the 
first time since 2012. The group’s 
arrival in Ann Arbor comes just 
weeks after University administra-
tors called out the series by name 
during an all-chapter mandatory 
meeting with University Greek life.

During the Sept. 10 meeting, in 

which University called on Greek 
life to stop perpetuating party cul-
ture, University President Mark 
Schlissel said the University’s rep-
utation will suffer if the organiza-
tion does not enact change.

“It’s not gonna be the kids who 

receive the Rhodes Scholarships 
and the Fulbright Scholarships, 
and the famous professors who do 
the work that you’re going to get 
reflected on for, or the National 
Medal for the Arts that our faculty 
won this past week,” Schlissel said. 
“It’s going to be the ‘Shmacked’ 
videos, so it’s really up to you what 
the value of your education is 
going to be, what the reputation of 
this institution’s going to be.”

Panhellenic Association Presi-

dent Maddy Walsh, an LSA junior, 
said risk management training and 
measures have already been put in 
place in advance of Saturday’s foot-
ball game against Michigan State. 

“All of the Panhel chapter 

presidents know I’m Shmacked 
is coming now and that people 
are talking about it. Our leaders 
have had many conversations and 
stressed to their members that it 
could be one person pictured in 
the video, but that reflects just 
as much on the University as on 
themselves and their chapters. 
So with that in mind and with all 
of the educational measures we 
are putting in place, I’m hopeful 
the weekend will go well,” Walsh 
said.

Walsh also added this weekend 

Panhel is piloting a Social Liaison 
program, akin to the Interfra-
ternity Council’s sober monitor 
program, and members have par-
ticipated in trainings with a Stu-
dent Life liaison from the Division 
of Public Safety and Security. 

“I’m Shmacked or no I’m 

Shmacked, PanHel has been doing 
a lot of work to implement risk 
management strategies because 
we know it’s going to be such a big 
weekend, with College Game Day 
here and it being the Michigan 
State game,” Walsh said. 

contribute to issues of mass 

violence.

Using 
the 
cycle 
of 

socialization 
model 
as 
a 

resource, students broke into 
small groups to discuss the 
lingering impacts of a culture 
that views mass violence as a 
social norm. The model suggests 
that dominant ideologies are 
reinforced in a society through 
repeated 
messages 
from 

institutions of power such as 
media outlets and businesses.

One group of students said the 

media tends to attach narratives 
to incidents of mass violence, 
such as narratives that suggest 
white mass shooters suffer from 
mental illness or that Black 
shooters are engaging in gang 
activity. 

During 
the 
discussion, 

Iguina-Colon 
shared 
an 

anecdote about how two of 
her male Black friends were 
relieved to learn the shooters 
at Northern Arizona University 
and 
Umpqua 
Community 

College were not Black.

“One of my other friends 

just kept scrolling down the 
news article, trying to find out 
about the race of the shooter, 
and when she found out he was 
white, she was relieved she 
didn’t have to worry about it,” 
she said. “I’m Puerto Rican, so 
I know I can empathize with 
that feeling. We look at news 
articles, and we just hope that 
it’s not us.”

Tuesday’s discussion ended 

with students thinking about 
what causes people to carry out 
mass violence. One student said 
that some people only believe 
their stories will be heard if 
they do something harmful or 
outlandish to receive attention.

In turn, members of IGR 

asked students to brainstorm 
ways people can understand 
each other before unfortunate 
acts of mass violence occur. 
Iguina-Colon 
said 
holding 

additional 
dialogues 
similar 

to Tuesday’s discussion would 
be beneficial for the University 
community.

“Holding 
dialogues 
like 

this where you talk about big 
topics and where you also do 
some 
inner 
reflections 
like 

this, where you think about 
what you can do, is important,” 

she said. “I think in the dorm 
setting, holding dialogues like 
this or with your friends or in 
your learning community is 
important in taking ownership 
because we are all responsible 
for what’s happening because 
we’re all part of the system.”

In an interview with the 

Daily after the event, LSA 
senior Elena Ross, a co-student 
engagement 
coordinator, 

said holding the discussion 
was important in prompting 
students to engage with issues 
surrounding gun violence.

“This 
epidemic 
of 
gun 

violence impacts all of us in 
ways we don’t even realize,” she 
said. “It’s easy to read and see 
about it in the news and become 
numb to it and not engage with 
it. Having an evening where 
people come together and talk 
about what it’s really like, and 
what role we play, and what it 
means for us and our daily lives 
and our sense of security in our 
life in general and on our college 
campus is really important.”

The 
Student 
Engagement 

Team hopes to hold a follow-
up 
candlelight 
vigil 
in 

remembrance of the victims of 
recent college shootings.

working in public health, told 
the crowd that the University’s 
commitment 
to 
community 

service and human rights is 
impressive.

“The University of Michigan 

has been a real beacon of hope 
and prosperity and human 
rights for so many years,” she 
said. “The bond between Peace 
Corps and the University of 
Michigan could not be stronger.”

Members of the University 

community may not be aware, 
however, of the crucial role 
University students and faculty 
played in the formation of 
the program, a government 
organization that deploys young 
adults to developing countries 
to 
provide 
assistance 
and 

promote cultural tolerance and 
interaction.

University alum Al Guskin, 

president emeritus of Antioch 
University, was a doctorate 
student in social psychology 
at the University 55 years ago 
when he attended Kennedy’s 
speech.

Guskin 
recalls 
Kennedy 

asking the crowd of about 
10,000 students: “How many of 
you who are going to be doctors 
are willing to spend your days 
in 
Ghana? 
Technicians 
or 

engineers, how many of you are 
willing to work in the foreign 
service and spend your lives 
traveling around the world?”

Four 
days 
later, 
Chester 

Bowles, 
Kennedy’s 
foreign 

policy adviser, spoke to a crowd 
in the Union ballroom. He 
discussed the work his son and 
daughter had been doing in 
Nigeria.

“Making 
Kennedy’s 

challenge 
such 
a 
concrete 

reality 
triggered 
something 

deep inside me,” Guskin said.

That night, he wrote a letter 

to The Michigan Daily on a 
napkin, challenging University 
students to commit to serving 
abroad.

Before 
the 
letter 
was 

published in the Daily, Guskin 
gathered with fellow students 
and friends to discuss ideas 
for the creation of a foreign 
service program. Together they 
formed a group that developed 

materials on what such a 
foreign service would entail 
and collected roughly 1,000 
students’ signatures of those 
committed to serving.

According 
to 
Guskin, 

Kennedy’s Michigan campaign 
manager heard about what their 
group was doing on campus 
and asked them to send their 
materials to him so that he 
could give them to Kennedy’s 
aides and speechwriters.

“Kennedy was taken with the 

idea — the fact that students had 
responded to his challenge,” 
Guskin said. Six days before the 
presidential election, Kennedy 
announced his commitment to 
the creation of the Peace Corps 
during a major foreign policy 
speech in San Francisco.

The 
Peace 
Corps 
was 

officially formed on March 1, 
1961, and Guskin and his wife 
served with the first group to go 
to Thailand from 1961 to 1964.

University President Mark 

Schlissel spoke later in the day 
at a panel for returning Peace 
Corps volunteers to share their 
experiences serving abroad.

“I’m delighted to be able to 

renew our collaboration and 
enhance our work to build a 
better future for our world. At 
the University of Michigan, 
we’re 
tremendously 
proud 

of the global opportunities 
we 
provide 
to 
students, 

and the Peace Corps is an 
essential component to our 
work,” Schlissel said. “The 
transformative 
experiences 

provided 
by 
the 
program 

closely 
align 
with 
the 

University of Michigan’s global 
engagement philosophy.”

Schlissel noted that the 

University is the fourth largest 
producer 
of 
Peace 
Corps 

volunteers over the course of 
the organization’s history.

“At 
the 
core 
of 
this 

philosophy is the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
passion 

for 
advancing 
the 
public 

good. 
High 
quality 
global 

collaborations 
enhance 
our 

ability to address the biggest 
challenges in our society while 
providing 
students 
with 
a 

cross-cultural foundation that 
will help them lead in a rapidly 
changing environment.”

wondered 
about 
the 
major 

difference the cash infusion 
had caused, which ultimately 
inspired her book.

“What was it about the cash 

that was so special?” Edin asked. 
“If it was true that there was a 
whole group of people living 
without cash since welfare 
reform, what did that look like 
and what were the implications 
for the well-being of families 
and children?”

Using data from the Survey 

of 
Income 
and 
Program 

Participation, 
a 
household-

based survey conducted by the 
U.S. Census Bureau, Edin and 
Shaefer found that in 2011 there 
were 1.5 million households 
— which included 3 million 
children — living on $2 a day.

Edin and Shaefer chose 

to investigate the $2 mark 
specifically because the World 
Bank defines moderate poverty 
worldwide as surviving on less 
than two U.S. dollars per day.

For “$2.00 a Day,” Edin and 

Shaefer conducted research in 
Chicago, the Mississippi Delta, 
Cleveland 
and 
Tennessee. 

Edin said they found many 
impoverished residents did not 
know about welfare programs 
such as Temporary Assistance 

for Needy Families or were told 
by social services that they did 
not qualify for assistance.

The authors discussed the 

major welfare reform in 1996 
that established TANF and 
eliminated a previous program, 
Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children. They cited that in 
1994, AFDC served 14.2 million 
people, but TANF today only 
serves 4.1 million people.

The authors said this decline 

in numbers of people receiving 
government 
assistance 
has 

contributed to the problem, 
and as a result, those who are 
extremely impoverished turn to 
other means of earning money 
— even repeatedly donating 
their own blood plasma.

Edin said Jessica Compton, a 

resident of Johnson City, Tenn., 
sometimes relies on the $30 she 
makes from donating plasma 
despite the negative health 
effects many repeat donors 
experience, 
like 
exhaustion 

from low iron levels.

“Plasma 
sales 
are 
so 

ubiquitous that many people 
(interviewed) had a little divet 
in their arm,” Edin said. “(It is) 
a marker of $2 a day poverty.”

The United States is the only 

developed country that allows 
blood plasma donations more 
than once a week.

The authors also encountered 

a 15-year-old girl living on $2 a 

day in Mississippi who resorted 
to exchanging sex after school 
with her gym teacher for food.

“We do understand that our 

book is depressing,” Shaefer 
said. “So, sorry about that.”

Edin 
and 
Shaefer 
said 

parents 
do 
their 
best 
to 

maintain a sense of dignity 
for their children, and anti-
poverty policies should focus 
on incorporating the poor and 
not isolating them.

They 
also 
emphasized 

that many people living in 
poverty want to work and not 
rely 
on 
welfare 
programs, 

saying everyone deserves the 
opportunity to work.

“This very strong connection 

to work in part comes from 
a desire to be a part of a 
community, to be apart of 
America,” Edin said.

Sandra Danziger, director 

of the Michigan Program on 
Poverty and Social Welfare 
Policy at the Ford School and 
professor of social work and 
public policy, said the topic of 
“$2.00 a Day” is important for 
fostering dialogue. 

“As much as the media and 

information is supposed to be 
so broad, you can live in this 
country and have no idea that 
this is happening,” Danziger 
said. “I think every college 
student should have to read it.”

don’t,” Assari said. “But the 
type of psychiatric disorder 
that 
may 
influence 
my 

perception of my mental health 
may be different than yours or 
other people’s.”

The 
study’s 
two 
focus 

groups — African American 
and 
Afro-Caribbean 

communities — were asked 
to self-evaluate their mental 
health. For the roughly 3,600 
African American individuals 
studied, 
anxiety 
but 
not 

depression was more likely 
to result in reporting mental 
health 
issues. 
In 
contrast, 

for the approximately 1,600 
Afro-Caribbeans in the study, 
depression was a more common 
indicator 
for 
self-reporting 

mental health challenges, as 
opposed to anxiety.

Assari 
said 
this 
finding 

about self-rated mental health 
could be key to innovation 
in 
psychiatric 
treatment. 

Specifically, 
knowing 
how 

seriously 
or 
not 
seriously 

certain 
groups 
perceive 

mental 
illness 
can 
help 

doctors convince patients to 
seek treatment, even if they 

do not see their disorders as 
problematic. 

“Self-rated mental health or 

the perception of our mental 
health is the type of certainty 
that makes you, if you have a 
psychiatric disorder, go take 
care of yourself,” he said. “It 
has major implications for 
connecting 
actual 
need 
to 

providing the care for the 
population. We are extending 
our 
research 
on 
group 

differences on how having 
that actual need doesn’t really 
translate 
similarly 
to 
that 

‘check engine’ light coming 
on.”

Assari 
added 
that 
self-

rated mental illness can lead 
to more effective treatment 
than 
diagnoses 
made 
by 

psychiatrists. 
If 
someone 

recognizes they feel bad, he 
said, they are more likely to 
react to medication for their 
illness.

“Psychiatrists may diagnose 

anxiety or depression, but what 
brings people to take care of 
themselves is, overall, a very 
simple feeling,” he said. “There 
is a mismatch between what 
psychiatrists diagnose and the 
perception of the person.”

Julie Ober Allen, a third-year 

doctoral student in the School 

of Public Health who has 
worked on with Assari on other 
studies, said the new research 
is crucial, particularly because 
national surveys don’t often 
provide breakdowns within 
racial groups. The Institute 
of Medicine, for example, has 
recommended questions that 
group ethnicities within a 
racial group together.

“The Institute of Medicine 

really wants to include a single 
mental health item, but this 
study suggests that in doing 
so we would really limit our 
capacity to provide services 
and to identify subgroups in 
the population,” Allen said.

Allen said the study is a 

starting point for changing 
how people think about mental 
health within racial groups, 
but noted that real changes 
in policy will take significant 
time.

“A single study such as this 

is not going to change the 
development of policy,” she 
said. “I think the more we can 
develop a body of research that 
problematizes some of their 
recommendations, the more 
it’s going to push some of the 
internal folks at the Institute of 
Medicine to question the value 
of 
their 
recommendations.

University music 
competion to 
award $100,000 
to winner

The 
University’s 
School 

of Music, Theatre & Dance 
announced 
it 
will 
hold 
an 

international music competition 
called M-Prize, which aims to find 
the most talented music ensembles 
in the world. The competition’s 
grand prize is $100,000, an award 
larger than any other offered in 
comparable competitions. 

For at least its first year, 

the competition will focus on 
chamber music, a form of classical 
music that was originally played 
by a group of people who could fit 
in a palace chamber. Ensembles 
made up of between three to eight 
members are eligible to apply. 

Begining in 2016, M-Prize 

will take place each May. The 
comptetition 
will 
be 
divided 

into a junior (participants 18 and 
younger) and senior (averaging 
19-35 years of age) competiton. 

M-Prize is currently accepting 

applications 
online. 
The 

registration deadline is March 1, 
2016. 

A dozen alleged 
pimps arrested in 
Detroit FBI sting

The FBI announced Tuesday 

that they arrested 12 pimps and 
rescued 19 teenage girls in a child 
sex trafficking operation out of 
metro Detroit. 

According to the Detroit Free 

Press, the girls, all minors ranging 
from 13 to 17 years old, were 
working as prostitutes in Detroit 
and other areas in Michigan.

FBI 
spokeswoman 
Jill 

Washburn said the operation, 
which was part of a national 
operation to stop sex trafficking 
across the nation, was conducted 
throughout last week. 

Michael 
Glennon, 
FBI 

supervisory special agent, said 
the pimps were both male and 
female and working primarily 
in Macomb, Oakland and Wayne 
counties. He also said while most 
of the girls his team rescued in 
the sting have since returned to 
their families, some have fallen 
back into the sex trade, despite 
an FBI victim specialist having 
worked with them. 

MSU to expand 
lab for growing 
diamonds

Michigan 
State 
University 

announced that it will invest $5 
million into expanding the MSU-
Fraunhofer Center for Coatings 
and Diamond Technologies, one 
of the university’s laboratories 
that is used to grow diamonds for 
industrial purposes. 

According to the Detroit Free 

Press, the university plans to add 
15,000 square feet of space to the 
lab, as well as new diamond syn-
thesis equipment. The expansion 
is expected to accomodate double 
the lab’s number of staff mem-
bers, which is now 30 scientists 
and technicians.

As the new space and equip-

ment will allow for an increase 
in personnel and research proj-
ects, the expanded lab is expect-
ed to earn $7 million in annual 
research revenue. 

MSU opened the lab in 2003 

with its corporate partner for the 
project Fraunhofer USA.

Barack Obama has also affirmed 
the strategic importance and 
mutually beneficial nature of the 
dynamic.

Singh was similarly emphatic 

about the partnership, citing 
shared institutions, aspirations 
and values.

“Together, 
we 
have 

characterized the motive of our 
partnership as, I quote, ‘Shared 
effort, progress for all,’ ” he 
said. “What does that mean? It 
implies that as the world’s largest 
and oldest democracies, and as 
pluralist 
and 
multiculturalist 

societies, India and the U.S. 

possess a natural synergy between 
our governments.”

Since 
India 
gained 

independence 
from 
Great 

Britain in 1947, the country has 
slowly 
developed, 
grappling 

with the large size, diversity 
and complexity of the Indian 
nation. Singh said only a quarter 
of the Indian population can be 
classified as middle-income, while 
about 200 million people live 
in poverty and 400 million lack 
access to commercial sources of 
energy.

Moving forward, Singh said 

it is critical that India embraces 
globalization and partners with 
the United States, one of the 
world’s largest economies. He also 
said the rest of the world must 

acknowledge India’s complexity 
to effectively engage with the 
country.

Singh was quick to stress that 

the relationship has not been only 
beneficial to India. He said the 
United States has also benefited 
from Indian friendship by taking 
advantage 
of 
the 
country’s 

advancements in the science and 
technology fields.

“The high-level attention that 

the two governments are now 
giving each other is not one-
sided,” he said.

He also spoke of how an Indian 

space vehicle reached Mars just a 
week after the U.S. vehicle landed 
there, adding that the cost of 
India’s vehicle stood relatively low 
at about $74 million U.S. dollars. 

He jokingly said this was less than 
the budget needed to produce a 
Hollywood movie about space.

The 
ambassador 
also 

championed the achievements of 
the United States’ Indian-origin 
community and its contributions 
to the country. He said 15 percent 
of all startups in Silicon Valley 
are owned by Indians and that 
one out of seven patients receive 
treatment by an Indian doctor.

In regards to international 

relations, Singh emphasized that 
India’s proximity to Pakistan, 
Afghanistan and the Middle East 
renders it a key strategic player in 
combating terrorism.

He also discussed his nation’s 

efforts to combat the global 
problem of climate change. He 

said 
the 
Indian 
government 

hopes to employ more renewable 
energy in the country’s future 
development.

“We should not just see what 

India and the U.S. can do for each 
other,” he said. “But what we can 
do for the world.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Hannah 

Lynn said she appreciated the 
contextual knowledge that Singh 
provided into Indian society, 
especially 
given 
her 
Indian 

heritage.

“I came to hear more about the 

politics between India and the 
U.S., which he definitely covered, 
and just a little more insight on 
what his position is,” she said. “I 
definitely learned more about the 
Indian population.”

R

ecently, I had the extreme 
pleasure of being in a choco-
late shop, which is where I 

would be all day, 
every day, if given 
the option. This 
enjoyment, how-
ever, was under-
cut by a strange 
trace of melan-
choly.

The 
entire 

time I browsed, 
I was barraged 
by 
a 
mixture 

of 
mournful-

ness and nostal-
gia. Had I been 
here before? Why was I thinking 
about how much I missed my dog 
and hadn’t talked to an old friend in 
ages? How had my thinking suddenly 
turned into existential dread where 
all I could contemplate was how use-
less everything we do is since our sun 
will eventually become a Red Giant 
and consume us anyway?

Just as I was coming to terms 

with how alone I am in the universe 
and how we are all born to die, I 
realized that the chocolate shop 
was actually playing a string 
of incredibly sad songs — “Say 
Something” by A Great Big World, 
“Fix You” by Coldplay and “Can’t 
Feel My Face” by The Weeknd, 
among others.

At first glance, this seemed like a 

terrible marketing plan: who wants 
to associate chocolate with sadness 
or the confusion and futile nature 
of living? In the American value 
system, chocolate is supposed to be 
a source of joy and meaning in the 
endless, empty void that is the uni-
verse, but they’d now linked it with 
anguish. After some discussion with 
my shopping companions, though, 
we brought the meaning of this mar-
keting campaign into new light.

The business owners were actu-

ally — on purpose or not — employ-
ing a psychological strategy called 
priming, in which the use of one 
stimulus (like sad music) influences 
the response to a different stimu-
lus (in this situation, for example, 
our need for chocolate went from 
merely extreme to dire). By making 
loneliness and unhappiness salient 
for the consumer, the need for the 
dopamine boost that chocolate pro-
vides grew. In all honesty, it seems 
to be a rather depressing tactic, but 
if it works, it works. 

Having established this, it should 

follow that this tactic of priming 
could be used to market just about 
anything, even ourselves.

Isn’t that exactly what we’re doing 

at events like the Career Fairs? Des-
perately trying to get the attention 
of recruiters who are already too 
overwhelmed with other resumes 
and elevator pitches to care? There 
has to be a better way to get a foot 
in the door, and I think we might all 
be able to take a leaf out of the book 
of this strange chocolate shop and 
extend this marketing strategy to us 
as individual commodities.

So how would one go about 

doing this?

At the next networking event you 

have the opportunity to attend, you 
should try executing your own subtle 
priming on the recruiter. One that 
I would try is helping the recruiter 
make the association between you 
and someone they would natu-
rally want to assist, such as a child. 
As humans, we are programmed 
through evolution with the impulse 
to help children. To execute this, 
refer to the recruiter as “mom” or 
“father” throughout the interview. 
This will forge a connection in their 
mind between the idea of being a par-
ent who wants their child to succeed 
and you as a candidate who is asking 
for a job. This plan is foolproof and 
will work, 100 percent guaranteed.*

Another priming tactic you could 

employ would be to go the opposite 
direction and prime the recruiter to 
have a great deal of respect for you. 
To do this, all you need to do is pre-
tend to be the company’s CEO and 
appear offended when they claim 
they don’t recognize you. You could 
even go so far as to threaten their 
job. This combination of fear for 
their livelihood and intimidation 
from speaking to the CEO of their 
organization will mentally prepare 
them to be very receptive to what-
ever you demand. They might be 
confused as to why their boss’ boss 
is asking for an entry-level position, 
but they can’t possibly turn you 
down; it’d be a pretty unwise career 
move for them.*

(* I am not legally able to give either 

such guarantee and am not liable for 
any consequences of attempting any 
of these tactics. In fact, maybe don’t 
try them.) 

I realize that both the LSA Fall 

Career 
Expo 
and 
Engineering 

Career Fairs have just passed, so 
maybe this advice is a little late, 
but there are always opportunities 
to try and get people to buy what 
you’re figuratively selling. In fact, 
these potential marketing schemes 
might be your ticket to not only an 
internship or job, but also a ticket 
to whatever it is you want — a date, 
a discount or another extension on 
a project that was due two months 
ago but you just couldn’t bring your-
self to do it because you just started 
binge watching “Breaking Bad” and 
you can’t just stop now because 
you need to know what happens to 
Jesse. The sky is the limit.

So give these ideas a try and tell 

me how they go. If all else fails, you 
always have the option of sitting in a 
chocolate shop and crying.

LEESON

I

’m new to The Michigan Daily, 
and if anyone had told me a year 
ago that I 

would be sharing 
my writing with 
thousands of stu-
dents and alumni 
and 
countless 

others, I would 
have taken it as a 
joke. I’m science-
minded, to say 
the least, so the 
prospect of put-
ting my opinion 
out there in writ-
ing for anyone 
and everyone to criticize is frighten-
ing. Though criticism can be negative 
at times (luckily I haven’t received 
anything too tough to handle, yet), it 
can also be constructive, which was 
the type I received in regards to my 
last article.

After my last article, “‘Organic’ 

and ‘healthy’ are not synonymous,” 
was published, I was contacted by 
Mischa Popoff, author of the book 
“Is It Organic?” and a long-term 
supporter of the organic movement. 
His response was not only positive, 
but also revealed a few facts about 
the organic industry that were 
interesting and conflicting at a fun-
damental level. Needless to say, no 
industry as large and rapidly grow-
ing as the organic industry is perfect, 
but Popoff peaked my interest, and 
was able to provide me with a follow-
up interview about his experience.

Popoff has been immersed in the 

organic-food realm his whole life. He 
grew up in Saskatchewan, Canada, 
on a grain farm that became fully 
organic in 1993, far before Canada (in 
2009) and the United States (in 2002) 
had national organic programs. For 
five years, Popoff worked as a United 
States Department of Agriculture 
contract organic inspector.

“I left the organic movement when 

I realized it was a bureaucratic scam 
designed to propel a political agen-
da,” he said. Popoff’s arguments cen-
ter on a few points: that “43 percent 
of all organic food sold in America 
actually tests positive for prohibited 
pesticides,” that organic-crop field 
testing is practically non-existent, 
and that the organic industry is fuel-
ing a fire against GMOs which has 
little to no scientific grounding.

I entered the interview expecting 

to speak to a man who only ate local 
foods, grass-fed meat and purely 
organic produce. I have realized now 
that nothing is so simple. Perhaps I 
was naive to think that the National 
Organic Program could be articu-
lated by a single man in such a linear 
manner. Though Popoff presented a 

number of good arguments, the issue 
is more complicated than simply con-
demning the entire organic industry.

“Some people say I’m anti-

organic for speaking out with the 
media like this, but the truth is I’m 
pro-organic, and I’m trying to save 
the industry I love,” he admitted. 
Popoff’s is only one of thousands of 
opinions about the successes and 
failures of the organic industry, and 
it’s important to approach each new 
one with caution.

From the research I have done 

on Popoff’s points, I’m in agreement 
with some of them, yet left in con-
fusion with others. The first of his 
statistics — essentially that every 
time you buy something bearing the 
organic seal (which is a complicated 
issue within itself) there is a 43-per-
cent chance it will actually test 
positive for pesticides — is more com-
plicated than just a single percentage.

First, it’s important to distinguish 

that the pesticides that are prohib-
ited in organic farming are synthetic. 
There are some organic pesticides 
that the USDA approves to be used 
on products, and for those products 
to be sold under the label “organic.” 
Even still, according to the USDA, 
“Organic agriculture practices can-
not ensure that products are com-
pletely free of residues; however, 
methods are used to minimize pollu-
tion from air, soil and water.”

The USDA claims that the main 

purpose of organic farming is to 
maximize “the balance of natural 
systems,” and to enhance “biodiver-
sity, biological cycles, and soil bio-
logical activity.”

It seems naive to assume that 

doing such things in a 100-percent 
natural way, without any inten-
tional or unintentional influence 
of 
technological 
advancements, 

is actually possible. Additionally, 
according to a 2010-2011 pilot study 
on pesticide residue testing, “As 
long as the operator hasn’t directly 
applied prohibited pesticides and 
has documented efforts to mini-
mize exposure to them, the USDA 
organic regulations allow residues 
of prohibited pesticides up to 5 per-
cent of the EPA tolerance.”

Popoff’s second claim, that there 

is absolutely no field testing of 
organic products, is also a compli-
cated issue to address, based solely 
on the issue of semantics. Words 
such as “testing” and “inspection” 
are thrown around as if they identify 
specific activities that are conducted 
on farms. The USDA identifies that, 
“Before a product can be labeled 
‘organic,’ a Government-approved 
certifier inspects the farm where 
the food is grown to make sure the 

farmer is following all the rules nec-
essary to meet USDA organic stan-
dards. Companies that handle or 
process organic food before it gets 
to your local supermarket or restau-
rant must be certified, too.”

As 
a 
consumer, 
“inspection” 

sounds fine, but does this include lab-
testing to ensure that the products 
do not exceed the allotted 5 percent 
of residues? Or does the term 
“inspection” simply imply passive 
observation of methods and crops. 
Additionally, only 5 percent of an 
organization products are tested 
once per year. What this means to me 
is that by the time it is found that a 
farm is not complying with organic 
standards, individuals could have 
purchased products from this farm 
under the impression that it was, in 
fact, organic. Maybe more pre-sale 
testing could benefit the industry 
after all.

The third and perhaps most 

worrisome issue with the organic 
industry is the rising push against the 
use of GMOs. Currently, according to 
the Organic GMO Policy, “The use of 
genetic engineering, or genetically 
modified 
organisms 
(GMOs), 
is 

prohibited in organic products.”

A report by Packaged Facts dem-

onstrated that of the $5 trillion retail 
value of the global food and bever-
age market, $500 billion dollars are 
attributed to the non-GMO market. 
Additionally, Packaged Facts pre-
dicts that the non-GMO market will 
almost double by 2019. There are con-
siderable resources being allocated to 
the marketing of GMO-free markets, 
that perpetuate the fear of these 
“alien” foods. However, the problem 
with this is that there is little scien-
tific evidence backing the claims that 
GMOs are harmful. In this regard, 
the money being spent within the 
anti-GMO movement should be allo-
cated to something more useful.

It’s evident that any industry as 

large and quickly growing as the 
organic industry is not perfect. The 
main issue, I believe, is transparency. 
Despite the countless annual reports 
and guidelines that are published by 
the USDA, the Agricultural Market-
ing Society (AMS), Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) and prac-
tically any other three to four letter 
acronym of an agency that exists 
under the umbrella of “food adminis-
tration,” there still seems to be little 
consensus on what’s actually going 
on and in what ways it’s truly neces-
sary to take action.

Until then, my biggest suggestion? 

Keep doing your own research.

The problem with organic

It’s radical we haven’t divested

Some of you may have heard of the Divest/

Invest Campaign on campus. However, we 
aren’t talking about the Israel-Palestine divest-
ment campaign; we are talking about the fossil 
fuel divestment campaign. What even is fossil 
fuel divestment? That’s a good question. On the 
Fossil Free campaign’s website, divestment is 
defined as, “the opposite of an investment — 
it simply means getting rid of stocks, bonds or 
investment funds that are unethical or morally 
ambiguous.” For our university, that means get-
ting rid of investments in our endowment that 
don’t meet our University’s moral standards for 
investment. These fossil fuel investments are 
not only risky for investors, as they are liable to 
become stranded assets, but they are also con-
tributing to the global warming of our planet. 
That’s why we are calling on the University to 
join the hundreds of other institutions that are 
divesting from fossil fuel companies.

Our campaign (which you can find out 

more about at divestum.org) has been doing 
a lot to try to get University President Mark 
Schlissel and our Board of Regents to do 
just that. Last year our campaign — like our 
climate — really heated up, as we increased 
pressure on the administration to begin the 
process of divesting from fossil fuels.

Our first major action of 2015 was Global 

Divestment Day on Feb. 13, as part of more 
than 450 events in 60 countries worldwide! 
We don’t mean to brag, but we also had one 
of the largest events, as more than 100 stu-
dents came out in single-digit temperatures 
for a rally in the Diag. On March 16, our Cen-
tral Student Government passed a resolution 
in support of our campaign with a 32-2 vote. 
On March 27 and 28, we participated in the 
Climate Teach-in +50, which was the largest 
climate event ever on campus. We heard from 
notables like Amy Goodman and Bill McK-
ibben telling us why we need to take action 
on climate change and why divestment is a 
great way universities can take action. Fast-
forward a couple weeks to April at one of the 
Board of Regents meetings, which we attend 
every month: We delivered a letter written by 
some faculty and staff that support divest-
ment. The cool part? We had more than 100 
other faculty and staff members sign on in 
support of the letter. These are only the high-
lights; we had numerous meetings with fel-
low students and numerous faculty and staff 
members to build up all the momentum we 
had last year.

Finally, some of Schlissel’s advisors, and 

later Schlissel himself, met with us to dis-
cuss divestment. Long story short: They 
don’t believe we’ve met the three-pronged 
standard that warrants a committee to sim-
ply look at the issue of divestment. Despite 
opposition from up top, we are not going 
away because this campaign is so much big-
ger than this campus. The divestment move-
ment began on college campuses and now has 

spread all around the world to religious insti-
tutions, nonprofit organizations, charitable 
foundations and even national governments. 
So far, there have been commitments to divest 
funds from fossil fuels from more than 2,000 
individuals and more than 430 institutions 
that span 43 different countries. Clearly, we 
are not alone, as there are still hundreds of 
divestment campaigns around the world with 
universities leading the way.

Other universities, such as Stanford Uni-

versity, the University of Maine and the Uni-
versity of California system, have pledged to 
divest their endowments from fossil fuels. 
Prominent institutions like the Guardian 
Media Group, Norway’s Sovereign Wealth 
Fund and even the Rockefeller Brothers Fund 
— history’s original oil barons — have pledged 
to divest. And even cities like Seattle and Ann 
Arbor have made commitments. That’s right: 
Our own city is completely divesting from 
fossil fuels, but our University won’t even 
form a committee to look at divestment from 
coal and oil.

OK, so we know that the University has bil-

lions of dollars in its endowment — just under 
$12 billion, to be exact — and because of the 
secrecy of the endowment, our best guess is 
that more than a billion of that is invested in 
fossil fuel companies. But why does divest-
ment matter? The core purpose of divestment 
is to morally, politically and socially bank-
rupt the fossil fuel companies. Because of the 
amount of money they pump into our political 
system and because our society is so reliant 
on fossil fuels, these multinational compa-
nies have control over our everyday lives and 
global geopolitics. These companies have 
enormous assets and divesting from them 
may partially disrupt their finances, but more 
importantly, will send a strong signal that 
the world is standing in solidarity against 
these companies. We are saying that these 
companies are uniquely responsible for cli-
mate change, and that we agree with people 
all over the world that action must be taken 
against climate change.

We continue to trumpet this call as every 

nation in the world meets in Paris in early 
December for the COP 21. We will stand up 
to the University and won’t back down until 
they commit to divest and join the hundreds 
of other institutions and universities that are 
on the path to divestment. We are not alone 
and can join the movement in making fossil 
fuels history, just like the more than 200 coal 
plants that have closed since 2008, the Key-
stone XL pipeline that still hasn’t been built 
and the Shell drilling operation abandoned in 
the Arctic. We are the Leaders and the Best, 
and we won’t rest until we divest.

and LSA sophomore Daniel Wu on behalf

DANIEL WU AND NICHOLAS JANSEN | VIEWPOINT

“W

hy would I sit around sober 
when I could sit around 
fucked up?”

A friend posed this ques-

tion to me a few days ago 
as we chatted over lunch. 
I pondered this thought as 
I took a sip of my water. I 
drink water because cof-
fee, tea and sugary drinks give me migraines. 
In fact, I have reached a point in my life where 
almost anything can trigger a migraine. Choco-
late, stress, caffeine, lack of sleep, rain, gluten, 
you name it; it gives me a migraine. However, 
the migraine trigger that has affected my life 
the most is alcohol.

Thanks to walking through football Satur-

days and watching the “I’m Shmacked” videos 
that litter YouTube, I’m guessing that we’re all 
well aware that there’s a lot of underage drink-
ing that happens at the University. A lot of it.

To be completely candid, throughout my 

freshman year, I did a lot of drinking. Every 
party I attended, I would have at least three 
drinks unless I was a designated “sober sister.” 
This is a job in which you refrain from drink-
ing in order to help out any sorority sisters who 
may need someone in control and aware of their 
surroundings to help.

Over the summer I began experiencing 

crippling migraines and very soon started an 
aggressive diet and lifestyle that focused on 
decreasing my headaches. This includes the 
paleo diet, no caffeine, obsession over sleep 
control and, of course, no alcohol.

I spent the month of August nervously antic-

ipating my return to Ann Arbor. What would 
it be like being sober all the time? Would I be 
able to have fun? Would I feel awkward? What 
would tailgates be like? I read articles about 

being sober in college, and I texted everyone I 
knew who didn’t drink.

As it turns out, being sober is not so terrible. 

In fact, it can be really fun. You remember 
everything, you feel great the next day, and I 
take it as an opportunity to eat extra cook-
ies because I’m not drinking so many calories. 
Being sober at parties has been an eye-opening 
experience for me because it has caused me 
to realize that we rely way too much on alco-
hol to have a good time. We rely too much on 
alcohol to be able to talk to someone we’re ner-
vous around and make new friends. We rely too 
much on alcohol even just to feel comfortable 
dancing. Being sober has taught me to embrace 
my awkward grandma dance moves. Now I just 
look like a proud grandma on an elevated sur-
face at tailgates.

I don’t think this means we have to all be 

sober all the time. It’s OK to occasionally want 
a drink here and there. I still wish for it some-
times, and sometimes I cheat. I also want to say 
that I’m not here to go into the debate of the 
current drinking age; that’s a can of worms I’m 
going to hold off on opening. I’m simply saying 
that going to a party and realizing how much 
fun you can have without being “shmacked” 
can be a very rewarding experience. It forces 
you to be comfortable in your own skin. Every-
one is too self conscious to see what you’re 
doing anyways.

I encourage you to at least entertain the idea of 

not drinking at the next party you go to. Don’t do 
it for me, or to be sober to protect your friends. Do 
it for yourself. Do it so you can wake up the next 
day feeling great, because you’re hangover free 
and because you went out of your comfort zone.

‘M’ furthers 
Rutgers’ woes

By ANNA HARITOS

For the Daily

Each team took the court ready 

to fight.

Wednesday, 
the 
Michigan 

volleyball team faced a Rutgers 
squad coming off an eight-
game losing streak and seeking 
redemption. 

But the 

victory 
belonged 
to 
the 

Wolverines (4-3 Big Ten, 14-4 
overall) who won the match, 3-1. 

Set one began as a ping-pong 

match of bump-set-spike between 
both teams, until Michigan called 
a timeout to regain its footing. 
With the score at tied at 10, 
the Wolverines came back out 
ready to pick things up as junior 
middle blocker Abby Cole led a 
three-point streak that thrusted 
Michigan back in the lead. From 
there, the Wolverines cruised and 
the set was finished off with a kill 
by freshman outside hitter Carly 
Skjodt to win the set, 25-19.

With all of the momentum, 

senior middle blocker Krystalyn 
Goode started off the second 
set with a kill. That early lead 
was the beginning of Michigan’s 
dominance 
over 
the 
Scarlet 

Knights (0-7, 3-16). The Wolverines 
doubled the amount of kills scored 
in the first set, ultimately finishing 
the set and winning, 25-12.

“I thought, offensively, we 

played well all night,” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 

In the third set, the Wolverines 

did encounter some trouble, as 
Rutgers came from behind for a 
win. Senior setter Carly Warner 
opened up the third set with a 
serve that was returned by the 

Scarlet Knights. Michigan led 
for a good portion of the set, but 
Rutgers never wavered. With the 
Scarlet Knights leading, 19-18, 
Michigan called a timeout, and 
came back with a kill by redshirt 
junior 
outside 
hitter 
Kelly 

Murphy. But the tie did not last, 
as Rutgers found a hole in the 
Wolverines’ defense. The Scarlet 
Knights did not hesitate to strike, 
ultimately taking the match in a 
25-21 victory.

“That’s the uniqueness of our 

sport,” Rosen said. “It’s not like 
there’s a clock involved where 
you know there’s a 30-point lead 
and there’s two minutes left and 
there’s no way they can catch us. 
In volleyball, they can always 
catch you.”

With the match still up for 

grabs, the start of the fourth 
set brought on an intensified 
atmosphere. Rutgers once again 
took an early lead after a five-point 
kill streak led by middle blocker 
Eden Frazier. But Skjodt was quick 
to retaliate and scored her career-
best 13th kill to even the score.

With the game as close as it 

had been all evening, every serve 
was eerily quiet momentarily 
before chaos broke out as a volley 
ensued. Both teams put up a good 
fight, but it was Michigan that 
walked away with a 25-23 win in 
the set to give it the match, 3-1.

While the Wolverines may 

have won, they were not entirely 
satisfied.

“This is a good group,” Rosen 

said. “They work hard, they’re 
tough kids and they want to be 
really good. And part of how they 
fought through is that they’ve got 
great character. Even if you don’t 
play well, your character doesn’t 
go anywhere.”

Kastroll steps up in freshman year

By BETELHEM ASHAME

Daily Sports Writer

Opportunities to impact a 

game come few and far between 
in soccer. Due to its low-scoring 
nature, soccer demands that its 
players take advantage of every 
chance that comes their way. Many 
players are adept at capitalizing 
on these opportunities, but only 
a few can go a step further and 
create their own opportunities.

Michigan freshman midfielder 

Abby Kastroll is one of those 
special players.

Entering a fairly stacked team 

with plenty of difference-makers 
— the team returned 100 percent 
of its goal-scoring from last season 
— Kastroll would not have been 
faulted for failing to find playing 
time, especially since freshmen 
typically spend their first year 
vying to prove their worth on the 
field.

However, Kastroll is anything 

but typical.

“We knew she was going to 

be good, but we had no idea that 
she was going to make this big of 
an impact,” said Michigan coach 
Greg Ryan. “All of a sudden, once 
she got a little bit of confidence, 
you go, ‘Whoa, this kid has a lot of 
talent and ability and drive.’

“She 
keeps 
growing 
and 

gradually getting better every 
week, and for a freshman, it’s 
come along very rapidly. For most 
people, this is a two- or three-year 
process, and she’s done it in half a 
season. It’s phenomenal.”

A multifaceted player, Kastroll 

has become a focal point of 
Michigan’s offense and defense. 
With four goals and four assists 
in 13 games, Kastroll has a total 
of 12 points, putting her in second 
place overall on the team. Though 
less 
statistically 
recognizable, 

her defensive contributions are 
equally valuable. She thrives as 
a physical, hard-nosed tackler, 
breaking up the rhythm of the 
opposition.

“I like to think that I play both 

sides of the field because they’re 
equally 
important,” 
Kastroll 

said. “I enjoy defending as much 
as attacking, sometimes even 
more. Taking the ball away from 
someone is one of my favorite 
parts of the game. The great part 
about defense is that it’s the start 

of the attack.”

Kastroll came up big for the 

Wolverines in two key Big Ten 
matches 
two 
weekends 
ago. 

In that Friday’s 1-0 win over 
Maryland, she scored the game-
winner, and two days later, in the 
team’s 1-1 overtime tie against 
then-No. 25 Rutgers, she delivered 
an assist to Michigan’s only goal. 
Both instances provide a glimpse 
into her special ability to go a 
step further and create her own 
opportunities.

Coming off a disappointing 

3-0 loss to Michigan State, the 
Wolverines were in need of a 
win against the Terrapins. Firing 
on all cylinders, Michigan came 
out blitzing but was unable to 
capitalize on its chances for most 
of the first half — until the 36th 
minute.

The 
Wolverines 
launched 

a 
seemingly 
non-threatening 

cross into the box. The ball was 
directed 
toward 
a 
Maryland 

defender without a Michigan 
forward nearby. But what seemed 
to be a routine play quickly 
developed into something more. 
The defender misplayed the ball 
off her chest, and one foot reached 
it before the rest. Kastroll had 
been watching the defender’s 
movement from the top of the box 
and could sense something was 

amiss. She made an instinctual 
run into the penalty area, cutting 
past her defender and finding 
some space. She was wide open 
when the ball dropped directly 
into her path, and she smashed it 
into the back of the net.

Coming into the match against 

Rutgers, the Wolverines had only 
faced one ranked opponent, losing 
2-0 to then-No. 13 Notre Dame. 
Determined to produce a better 
performance and result, Michigan 
managed to go toe-to-toe with the 
Scarlet Knights in a scoreless first 
half. Both sides seemed evenly 
matched, 
but 
Michigan 
was 

looking for the upset.

Ten minutes into the second 

half, the Wolverines sent a corner 
kick into the crowded penalty box. 
The ball was bouncing around 
inside the area in a frenzy of 
attempted passes and attempted 
clearances, but no one could fully 
control it. Except for Kastroll, that 
is. She beat her defender again 
to reach the ball first and touch 
it toward sophomore forward 
Taylor Timko, who then sent it 
into the six-yard box, where senior 
midfielder Corinne Harris finished 
it off to give them a 1-0 lead.

In both of those games, Kastroll 

put herself — not just found 
herself — in the right place at the 
right time. Reaping the benefits 

of her efforts, she was named Big 
Ten Freshman of the Week last 
week.

“I honestly don’t know what 

we would have done without her,” 
Ryan said. “She’s one of those 
players that drives your team in a 
positive way. The other team just 
hates playing against her because 
she’s a player they have to deal 
with, which makes her an X-factor. 
Usually you don’t look at other 
teams and go, ‘Well we’ve got to 
deal with their freshman player,’ 
but I think teams are looking at 
Abby and going, ‘We’ve got to find 
a way to slow that kid down.’ ”

Interestingly 
enough, 
Ryan 

seemed to foreshadow Kastroll’s 
dominant impact in an interview 
over a month ago.

“It’s not often that I feel like we 

have a freshman that can change 
the course of our season,” Ryan 
said. “But I think Abby has that 
ability to change the course of the 
season for this team.”

Clearly, 
Ryan 
recognized 

Kastroll’s special nature from 
the start. Despite her youth, she 
has become an automatic in the 
starting lineup because her value 
to the team can’t be overstated. 
For 
Michigan 
this 
season, 

Kastroll’s emergence resembles 
her playing style.

Right place, right time.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Abby Kastroll has scored four goals and four assists through the first 13 games of her freshman season.

Skjodt, Cole star 
for Wolverines

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

Seven 
members 
of 
the 

Michigan 
volleyball 
team 

registered at least one kill 
Wednesday in the Wolverines’ 
3-1 victory over Rutgers.

But freshman outside hitter 

Carly Skjodt and junior middle 
blocker Abby Cole stood out 
from the pack. Skjodt finished 
the match against the Scarlet 
Knights (0-7 Big Ten, 3-16 
overall) with 13 kills — a career 
high — on 25 attempts along 
with 11 digs and five blocks with 
no errors. Cole netted 15 kills on 
33 attempts.

“You need people who are 

going to step up,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “I think 
Abby is doing a great job of 
that.”

Skjodt and Cole dominated 

in Michigan’s 25-12 victory in 
the second set. Skjodt made a 
splash when she and sophomore 
middle blocker Claire Kieffer-
Wright produced a highlight-
reel block to force an attack 
error and give the Wolverines 
(4-3, 14-4) a 21-7 lead. She also 
netted five kills in the set.

Cole 
produced 
a 
strong 

second-set performance in her 
own right as she made three 
kills.

Cole lit her biggest spark for 

Michigan in the first set. With 
the score tied at 10, she put down 
back-to-back kills to give the 
Wolverines a two-point edge. 
Michigan never relinquished 
its lead at any point during the 
set as Cole later recorded three 
straight kills en route to a 25-18 
win for the Wolverines. She 
finished the set with five kills.

“We 
actually 
switched 

Abby’s position,” Rosen said. 
“It’s the first time in her career 
that she played on the left side. I 
thought there were some areas 
she did tremendous with, and 
I thought that there were some 
areas that she still needs to get 
better at, but I expect that. We 

moved her over there to get her 
more involved in the offense.”

But Skjodt was not about to 

be outdone. She put down four 
kills on five attempts in the first 
set, including two consecutive 
kills to end the set. She also 
came up with five digs during 
that time.

“I 
thought 
Carly 
Skjodt 

played great tonight,” Rosen 
said. “Because Abby is very 
inexperienced with what we 
call ‘out-of-system’ balls, we 
sent a lot of those balls to 
(Skjodt). When you handle as 
many out of system balls as 
she did tonight and make zero 
errors, that’s a great night.”

In the third set, the Scarlet 

Knights went on a 7-1 run 
to 
narrow 
Michigan’s 
lead 

to 14-13. But Skjodt came up 
strong with a block that forced 
an attack error and gave the 
Wolverines a point. Later, with 
Rutgers leading 23-20, Cole put 
down a kill to trim the deficit to 
two.

Unfortunately for Michigan, 

the effort proved futile as the 
Scarlet Knights took the set, 
25-21.

“You can win a set so 

dominantly (in volleyball) and 
then it just resets,” Rosen said. 
“That’s the unique thing about 
our sport. Maybe tennis is 
similar.”

Then Michigan won the final 

set, 25-21, with Cole and Skjodt 
again coming up with critical 
plays. Cole made four kills 
during the set, including one 
that gave the Wolverines a 23-21 
advantage, while a Skjodt block 
capped off a 3-0 Michigan run 
to give it a 21-19 edge.

Wednesday 
was 
not 
the 

first time the duo of Cole and 
Skjodt has paid dividends for 
the Wolverines. Skjodt came 
up with a personal-best 16 digs 
Oct. 10 in Michigan’s 3-0 defeat 
at the hands of Nebraska. As for 
Cole, the Rutgers match was 
the 10th time this season she 
netted 10 or more kills.

Fisch prepares for MSU defense once again

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Jedd Fisch remembers seeing 

a Michigan State defense once 
before. It was Halloween 2009, 
when he was the offensive 
coordinator 
and 
quarterbacks 

coach at Minnesota.

That night, his offense racked 

up more than 500 total yards and 
42 points, and quarterback Adam 
Weber finished 19-for-31 for 416 
yards and five touchdowns.

That was a different Michigan 

State team, but Fisch, Michigan’s 
passing game coordinator, is 
also coaching a different team 
now. He and the 12th-ranked 
Wolverines take on the Spartans 
on Saturday.

In 
2009, 
Michigan 
State 

stumbled to a 6-7 finish, as did 
Minnesota. Fisch spent only 
that year in Minneapolis before 
moving to the NFL’s Seattle 
Seahawks. Six years later, he 
is in Ann Arbor, while former 
Michigan 
State 
defensive 

coordinator Pat 
Narduzzi is in 
Pittsburgh as a 
head coach.

Two 

things remain 
constant: 
Spartans head 
coach 
Mark 

Dantonio 
and 

the 
stingy 

defensive scheme he runs in East 
Lansing.

“They play similar fronts and 

coverages,” Fisch said. “Coach 

Dantonio, it seems like he’s 
kept the system the same from 
when Coach Narduzzi left. Very 
similar in what they do. They’re 
a quarters team, and they mix in 
some other coverages and play a 
four-down front.

“They’re 

very good at 
what they do. 
They have an 
identity. 
It’s 

very 
clear. 

They’ve 
won 

a lot of games 
with 
that 

defense. A lot 
of teams have 

tried to replicate that defense.”

Michigan State’s defense has 

dominated the Wolverines in 
each of the past two years, but 

the circumstances have changed 
now. Though they have escaped 
the first half of their schedule 
unscathed at 6-0, the Spartans 
have looked vulnerable.

Though 
their 
defense 
has 

remained relatively similar since 
Fisch last saw it, Fisch is focused 
on this year when preparing for 
this week. A win six years ago, 
or even film from last year, won’t 
give him an edge.

“You look at the games they’ve 

played this year, because you’re 
looking at the players they have,” 
he said. “It’s a totally different 
team. You just look at their 
defense and what they’ve had to 
defend, and they have defended 
it all.

“I think they have a great edge 

there. They’ve probably seen 

every possible run and every 
possible route combination and 
been able to find ways to defend 
all of them. They obviously have 
a great advantage of being in the 
same system for so many years.”

That system has given Michigan 

problems in past years, but it 
might see a few extra wrinkles 
this year. The Wolverines seem 
to have expanded their playbook 
every week to the point where it’s 
much more diverse than last year. 
It now includes plays such as end-
around runs, more complex read 
progressions and a bevy of screen 
passes to get playmakers in space.

Halfway through the season, 

Michigan’s offense, much like 
its defense, seems to be playing 
its best football of the year. 
Fisch hinted at opening up the 

playbook even more this week, as 
the Wolverines might need more 
of it to finally crack Michigan 
State’s defense.

“We’re 
very 
game 
plan-

specific. We’re going to try to 
come up with the best possible 
formations for the team we’re 
playing, and with that whatever 
concepts that go along with 
those formations. We have had 
a lot of different formations 
and personnel groupings and 
concepts.”

In 
that 
way, 
Fisch 
said, 

Michigan, too, has an identity.

“We’re going to be somebody 

that’s going to find ways the best 
we can to put our guys in the best 
possible position to succeed,” he 
said. “With that comes a variety 
of formations.”

FOOTBALL

“They’re very 
good at what 

they do.”

30-Year Anniversary

The
Heidelberg
Project

celebration at UMMA

 2016 marks the 30th anniversary of Tyree Guyton’s 
site-specific art installation on the east side of Detroit, 
The Heidelberg Project, and everyone wants in on the 
celebration. Well, maybe not the arsonists who torched 
the project last year, or the opponents who bulldozed it 
or those who brought Mr. Guyton to trial over the past 
three decades. But the obstacles and strife are all the 
more reason to celebrate the reach, energy and resilience 
of Guyton’s irrepressible oeuvre.
 What has come to be known as the Heidelberg 
Project is two city blocks of ever-evolving, art-adorned 
houses, found object sculptures and interior urban-folk 
museum spaces that have stood as playfully as they have 
steadfastly against the blight of inner-city decay. It is 
named for Heidelberg Street, in Detroit’s McDougall-
Hunt neighborhood, the block where it began and on 
which Guyton grew up.
 The University of Michigan Museum of Art has 
curated an exhibition titled “The Art of Tyree Guyton: A 
Thirty-Year Journey” since August and will run through 
Jan. 3, 2016. It is presented in tandem with the Depart-
ment of Afroamerican and African Studies’ current 
exhibition “What Time Is It? Tyree Guyton, New Work” 
running through Nov. 6. Many ancillary events — in-
cluding gallery talks, a dialogue with Tyree and his wife 
Jenenne Whitfield the other week at UMMA and a Q&A 
with student organization Stamps in Color — a commu-
nity of students of color in the School of Art & Design at 
the University — have provided spaces for students and 
Ann Arborites to engage with Tyree and his work. On 
Sunday, Oct. 18 there will be a guided tour, and a dis-
cussion with Taubman faculty on art and urban planning, 
and “In Conversation: The Art of Tyree Guyton: From 
the Street to the Studio” will take place Nov. 8.
 “Well, it’s a funny kind of retrospective because it’s 
an outdoor dynamic project that changes constantly,” 
said UMMA exhibition curator MaryAnn Wilkinson. 
“Not only because of Tyree’s work, but because it gets 
torn down sometimes or it gets burned down some-
times. I mean it’s always changing and you can’t really 
do a timeline the way that you can do in a typical art 
exhibition where you can start with the artist’s early 
work and you know the end. You can’t really do that 
with this because it doesn’t — somehow it misses the 
point to do that.”

Dear Gillian, 
The man (boy?) I love does not 

love me back. I finally let the words 
come out of my blabbing, hesitant 
mouth too little too late. He says 
he felt love at 
some point, but 
it’s not there 
anymore. Even 
the physical 
desire is gone. 
Now I’m left 
with the worst 
feeling — the 
kind that 
burns the back 
of your throat 
and makes your breath heavy 
when you linger on it too long. It 
makes me cry at the end of every 
poem, every song, every movie. I 
feel alone in this because he does 
not have said feeling. But I’m not 
actually alone, because we still 
see each other (as friends). He still 
wants my company and I his. I just 
have the short end of the stick. 

How could someone not love 

you and know you love them but 
still want to spend time with you? 
How do I let myself give that time? 
 

- In need of a nudge 
Dear Nudge,
Yes, poems, songs and movies 

can sometimes flood your tear 
ducts with idealized romance in 
Hollywood or sickly sweet love 
lyrics on Spotify. Yet the right ones 
can provide a cathartic reflecting 
pool and even hold your hand 
through lost, unrequited love. 

The ancient Greek poet 

Theognis of Megara (your “man/
boy?” distinction…that had its 
own significance in Ancient 
Greece, but that’s beside the point) 
had a lyric that may resonate: 
“My heart’s in pain because of 
my love of you, / For I can’t either 
hate or love, / Knowing it’s hard 
when a man’s your friend / To 
hate him, and hard to love him if 
he doesn’t want.” In the ancient 
Greek tradition it was common 
for one person to play hard to 
get to another, creating clear 
lover and beloved categories in 
a relationship (at least in terms 
of public appearance.) Although 
this one-sided relationship was 
commonplace, Theognis was still 
trying to reconcile in his elegiac 
poetry an unrequited love, the 
object of which you would usually 
want cast away to the depths of 
Hades, with a friendship. It’s a 
tough struggle you’re engaged 
in, one that’s been eating away at 
hearts since the 6th century BCE.

Your feeling of loneliness, 

Nudge, even in his company, is 
only to be expected. Many of 
American artist Edward Hopper’s 
realist paintings in the early 
and mid-20th century portray 
a solitary figure in the modern 

world. In “Room in New York” 
(1932), his study of loneliness is 
magnified with two individuals 
occupying the same space, but 
who could not be further apart 
from one another. The viewer of 
the painting plays voyeur as he or 
she gazes in through a window 
framing a sharply dressed man 
and woman sitting around a 
small wooden table in their living 
room interior. They are together 
at the table, but draw away from 
one another: the man bent over 
reading a newspaper; the woman 
twisting over her shoulder to play 
a note on the piano behind her. 
You may be just as lonely in his 
company spending time as friends 
and not as lovers as you would be 
on your own. His presence may 
magnify what is lacking in your 
relationship. Maybe confront the 
loneliness instead of masking it so 
you can move on.

On the other hand, lost love or 

love-just-out-of-reach can be the 
most powerful artistic force in 
the universe. Unrequited love is 
ennobling, coaxing tours-de-force 
and magni opi from artists and 
authors since the dawn of time. 
But its effects are exponentially 
more powerful if your muse is 
right there, only just barely out 
of reach. That special kind of 
unrequited love — love requited 
only with friendship — is the 
perhaps the most hopeful (and 
tortuous) kind. 

This is not Apollo and Daphne 

nor Goethe’s Werther, unrequited 
love made hopeless by Eros’s 
vengeance and Charlotte’s 
marriage. This isn’t Hans 
Christian Anderson’s “Little 
Mermaid” — she sold her soul 
to get legs with which to chase 
her man, who then didn’t even 
recognize her as his rescuer. 
This is not Cervantes’ “Quixote,” 
whose Dulcinea didn’t even exist. 
This is access to your unrequited 
lover with each phase of the moon 
and, ergo, the chance to reignite 
his/her love for you. Sufferers of 
impossible unrequited love do 
great things in stoic acceptance of 
their suffering, but lovers requited 
with friendship do great things 
and, sometimes, win their friends’ 
hearts in the process. Affection 
doesn’t function in fixed states but 
is ever evolving.

Love can be re-attained, but 

I hesitate to suggest you try 
to win your guy back if you’ve 
already laid your thoughts and 
feelings bare. There are two 
paths out of the friend zone, the 
patient pursuit and the decisive 
door slam. The former is not for 
everyone, but it works for some. 

Check out the 1990 Whit 

Stillman film “Metropolitan,” 
which won an Academy Award 

for its screenplay. In it, a rat pack 
of debutante ball-going, Park-to-
Fifth-Avenue-roaming Ivy League 
undergrads take in Tom, a barely 
middle-class kid from the wrong 
side of Central Park who studies 
left-leaning political science at 
Princeton on scholarship. As a 
group of friends, they bring him 
along to their crowd’s Christmas 
season parties. Audrey falls in 
love with Tom, but he rejects her 
at first, a rejection made all the 
more painful by the near-constant 
time the group spends together. 
Yet it’s that friend time that brings 
Tom around to regretting the 
rejection and when Audrey agrees 
to accompany the high-society bad-
boy character to the Hamptons, 
Tom realizes his feelings for her and 
heads out there to win her over.

Maybe you saw the recent piece 

in the New York Times by the poet 
and author Elinor Lipman called 
“Taking a Break for Friendship.” 
Lipman dates, is rejected, remains 
friendly and writes an essay for 
publication about the situation, 
which becomes the catalyst for 
attracting him back. The takeaway 
is that the friendship is the chance 
to showcase your talents and charm 
to pave your person’s road of return.

But Nudge, please don’t let this 

prospect torture you. Your man-
boy cannot have it both ways and 
expect everything he wants. That 
is not fair to you. Keep doing things 
that make you happy both within 
and beyond boyman’s earshot. If he 
has an epiphany, he knows where 
to find you, but I wouldn’t settle 
for friendship if you find it too 
upsetting. But do keep your eyes 
open for something unexpected.

I’ll leave you with some more 

modern lyric poetry (Theognis 
is so 58th Olympiad … ) by the 
singer/songwriter/rapper Lauryn 
Hill from “When it Hurts So 
Bad” on her 1998 album, The 
Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill.

I loved real, real hard once
But the love wasn’t returned
Found out the man I’d die for
He wasn’t even concerned
I tried, and I tried, and I tried
To keep him in my life
I cried and I cried, and I cried
But I couldn’t make it right
But I, I loved the young man
And if you’ve ever been in love
Then you’d understand
What you want might make 

you cry

What you need might pass you 

by.

CULTURAL CURES COLUMN

Dear Gillian: 

Unrequited love

StarKids return, talk 
time at alma mater

By REBECCA GODWIN

Daily Arts Writer

My 
Wednesday 
last 
week 

offered 
no 
evidence 
that 
it 

would be anything but normal 
— that was, until I found myself 
opening an e-mail from one 
of the original StarKids, Brian 
Holden, a 2008 Music, Theatre & 
Dance alum, inviting me to come 
to their rehearsal to interview 
the group. I have made multiple 
friends through a shared love of 
the group. Their shows helped 
remind me how much I love the 
theatre, and their humble start 
at the University left me with the 
hope that I, too, could create and 
stage my own show — which I did. 
So it’s pretty safe to say StarKid 
has had a pretty big impact on 
my life. I immediately cleared my 
to-do list, rearranged my work 
schedule, and conveniently forgot 
about my classes.

For those who don’t know, 

StarKid is a theatre group that 
originated here at the University in 
2009 when they performed their 
original musical, “A Very Potter 
Musical,” a parody of the Harry 
Potter series. They uploaded the 
show to YouTube, and soon the 

group of college friends found 
themselves launched into Internet 
fame. The production is still their 
most popular with more than 11 
million views, but they have gone 
on to do many other successful 
parodies. The group has since 
moved to Chicago, and while it 
has added members over the years, 
it’s still made up almost entirely 
of University alumni, including 
“Glee” star Darren Criss.

It didn’t take long for me 

to make my way to the Power 
Center, and then suddenly I was 
in the room and shaking Brian’s 
hand and he was introducing me 
to the entire group. Darren was 
the first to stop and introduce 
himself, shaking my hand and 
letting me know he was there to 
help with whatever I may need. 
I returned the handshake with 
a polite smile and pretended as 
though I didn’t already know his 
name and I wasn’t a huge fan. 
This would eventually become a 
theme throughout the day.

I sat and observed for about 20 

minutes until I noticed Lauren 
Lopez, a 2009 Music, Theatre 
& Dance alum, taking a break. 
Lauren is best known for her 
portrayal of Draco Malfoy in 

“A Very Potter Musical,” but 
she has been with StarKid from 
the beginning and has starred 
in almost every production. I 
approached slowly, asking what 
made her want to come back and 
do the reunion show.

“There wasn’t even a question,” 

she said. “It was an immediate yes, 
because the chance to come back 
to Ann Arbor, not only come back 
but to come back with a group 
of friends that I’ve known for 10 
years, who we all share a college 
experience, and to come back to 
the place where literally all of this 
started is super special. It is just a 
really special opportunity.”

Very quickly, Nick Lang, 

2008 Music, Theatre & Dance 
alum, called Lauren back up 
on stage, but my first StarKid 
interview was a good start. 
Nick was taking on the role of 
director for the concert, but he 
is best known for writing the 
StarKid shows, along with his 
brother, 2010 LSA alum Matt 
Lang. Others have assisted with 
the writing on different shows, 
but Nick and Matt are the only 
ones whose names can be found 
on every StarKid script.

Beginnings

During the Q&A with Stamps 

in 
Color 
students, 
Guyton 

spoke a bit about the changes 
in the city of Detroit over his 
lifetime and the impetus for his 
community artwork.

“I grew up on Heidelberg 

Street and I remember when it 
was a thriving neighborhood, 
Blacks 
and 
whites 
living 

there,” Guyton said. “In the 
’60s and over the years it began 
to change: You know the ups 
and downs of the automobile 
industry, the Vietnam War, 
Wall Street. All these things 
had an effect on the city of 
Detroit. I remember some of the 
white kids I used to play with 
and how they moved away.”

Guyton 
left 
Detroit 
for 

a 
period 
and 
then 
moved 

back at the wish of his aging 
grandparents. It was Guyton’s 
grandfather who gave him a 
paintbrush at a young age and 
instilled in him the passion to 
create. Pursuing his study of 
art at the College of Creative 
Studies, 
Guyton 
met 
artist 

Charles McGee who became his 
mentor. In a formative moment 
McGee 
prescribed 
him 
a 

bizarre exercise to find himself 
by 
locking 
himself 
in 
his 

studio for two weeks, smoking 
joints while listening to John 
Coltrane, getting naked and 
painting his body. It may sound 
crazy, but it was from this act 
of sustained introspection that 
Guyton was able his understand 
his community and what he 
could do for it.

The 
Heidelberg 
Project 

would 
become 
an 
external 

extension 
of 
this 
gained 

understanding. Back in Detroit, 
it was important for Guyton to 
share with his neighbors the 
freedom of art and creative 
thinking he’d discovered — not 
just to render creative images 
on canvas or paper, but to 
reimagine the aesthetic of his 
urban landscape and its social 
climate. Noticing that a lot of 
them weren’t going to the DIA 
or exhibitions in Ann Arbor, 

Guyton 
was 
determined 
to 

bring art to the people, citing a 
piece called “More Power to the 
People.”

“It was my way of using 

the Heidelberg project as a 
medicine to help the people 
understand the importance of 
thinking for themselves.”

Some of the neighbors on 

Heidelberg Street had a knee-
jerk 
reaction 
of 
distrust. 

They didn’t like it; they didn’t 
want it there. Provoking any 
response, positive or negative, 
laid the foundation for Guyton 
to open conversations with his 
community, to tease out, person 
by person, what they thought 
about the project and what they 
thought the larger implications 
were.

“He intends it as a gift to his 

neighborhood and to the city,” 
Wilkinson said. “But you know 
everyone gets gifts that they 
don’t quite know what to do 
with and that’s what this is.”

Opposition, public and 

private

The reaction Guyton drew 

was art criticism on steroids, 
with 
repetitive 
cases 
of 

litigation and acts of violence 
against the Heidelberg Project. 
The political implications of his 
art became unavoidable.

“The city said to me … that art 

goes in an institution,” Guyton 
said. “And I said well what do 
you mean? And they said you 
put it in a building behind walls, 
so I heard that. And then I was 
told by the city government 
that I should leave the city 
and I should go to New York, 
that New York is a place that 
accepted art, or Chicago. Then 
I was told that I had too many 
white people coming, and then 
I was told that I had too many 
people coming in general.”

Government 
officials 

didn’t really understand what 
the project was, how to talk 
about it or how to accept it. 
In the ’90s Mayor Coleman 
Young dispatched bulldozers. 
Guyton spent a lot of money 
and time in the Detroit courts 
and 
administrative 
agencies 

fighting the political opponents 
of 
the 
project. 
Guyton 

eventually won the right to 

keep the project on Heidelberg 
Street. 

“Every time the city came to 

demolish the project, something 
inside of me said, ‘Do it again,’ 
and I went out there and I start 
doing it again.”

Arson was another problem. 

With the 12 fires, some as 
recently as last year, Guyton 
had to summon his spirit to help 
his art continually rise from the 
ashes.

“The voice said ‘Make it 

greater’ than before,” Guyton 
said. “And I did.”

One of the pieces Guyton 

created specifically for the 
UMMA exhibition, a mixed-
media sculpture titled “How 
Much for the City” addresses 
these 
deep-rooted 
struggles 

with the city government.

During the arson episodes 

last year, a destroyed television 
set appeared on the street. An 
upset Guyton left it out there 
for a few days as he turned its 
significance over in his mind: 
How could he transformed it 
into something positive and 
interactive?

“Flip the script: turn it into 

Heidelberg television,” Guyton 
said. “My job as an artist is 
to find solutions. So someone 
came over, dropped a television 
set off ,and it came to me: to 
create Heidelberg Television. 
So that television set was on 
the project and I had the kids 
of 
Heidelberg 
Street 
come 

down and they would write 
television shows for me. So they 
were performing behind that 
television set.”

It was important to Wilkinson 

to 
feature 
the 
Heidelberg 

Television in the exhibition 
at 
UMMA. 
Borrowed 
from 

the project space for a period 
of time, the physical frame 
tells the story of the people 
and activities on Heidelberg 
Street. The television displays 
a slideshow of many of the 
art-adorned houses and their 
social 
or 
aesthetic 
themes, 

such as house of soul, polka 
dots and clocks among many 
others, some of which are no 
longer standing. These images 
allow people who have maybe 
have never seen the Heidelberg 

Project to get a sense of its many 
incarnations over the years.

Recreation and rebuilding 

on the foundation

The second of the two new 

works Guyton is creating for 
the UMMA exhibition will 
not be featured in the gallery, 
but on Heidelberg Street itself. 
Thinking about the 12 fires and 
what to do about them, Guyton 
met with a team of architects to 
develop a plan to build a house. 
After initial concern and doubt 
posed by the architects about 
the stability of the foundations 
damaged by the fire, Guyton 
convinced them to shore up and 
salvage what had been damaged 
and simply build on top. The 
result is doubly powerful.

“Two plus two equals eight,” 

Guyton said. “I’m never starting 
over; I’m just adding. I keep 
adding. That’s what I do.”

The reconstruction of one of 

the houses on Heidelberg Street 
is being filmed in real time and 
Wilkinson plans to have the 
footage shown in the exhibition 
to celebrate the process of 
rebuilding and connect visitors 
of the gallery with the site in 
Detroit.

Global perspective and 

recognition

Guyton 
returned 
from 
a 

year-long residency in Basel, 
Switzerland in 2012 where he 
studied Plato and wrote his 
forthcoming book. The small 
city of Basel boasts more than 
40 museums. With art and 
artists 
everywhere, 
Guyton 

was constantly seeing pieces 
and their creators and engaging 
in 
dialogue 
(not 
only 
the 

Socratic kind) with some of his 
international contemporaries.

“I went over there to learn, 

to listen and to see, and I think 
today if you’re going to be an 
artist, and this is my opinion, 
you have to think global,” 
Guyton said. “And you have 
to see (the world) because it 
helps to grow (the Heidelberg 
Project).”

Taking a year way from the 

Heidelberg 
Project 
allowed 

Guyton to reflect on his decades 
of work and formulate how he 
would return to it. UMMA’s 
exhibit displays some of his 
prints and studio work from his 
Switzerland residency. Though 
living abroad had its challenges, 
the 
glamour 
of 
an 
artist 

residency 
threw 
into 
relief 

some of the more gritty work 
there is to be done at home.

“For me, going somewhere else, 

they roll the red carpet out for 
you. The real challenge is here.”

Reach of the project and 

visitors

The 
arrival 
of 
young 

artists to Detroit’s blighted 
neighborhoods 
is 
by 
now 

well underway. But it’s more 
than just cheap rent drawing 
them; that’s available in lots of 
places. It’s the storied legacy 
of 
Detroit’s 
creativity 
and 

determination that sets it apart, 
and Heidelberg embodies it.

“I do think that having the 

Heidelberg Project there with 

its example of what an artist can 
do to try to change people’s lives 
gives later artists the freedom 
to do all kinds of things,” 
Wilkinson said. “I think what 
is happening in Detroit could 
maybe have never happened 
without the Heidelberg Project 
being here, and all of its 
contentiousness … But I really 
think that it’s so different even 
though there’s a long history in 
Detroit of artists making things 
out of junk. Many artists here 
do that because that’s what you 
can find when you’re in Detroit 
and there’s sort of a Detroit 
ethos to it.”

Guyton has paved the way 

for large-scale public artworks, 
which have been springing up on 
smaller scales all around the city.

“And now you get this new 

energy that’s coming into the 
city from all over the world,” 
Guyton said. “Thirty years ago 
when I started, I knew that I 
was on to something. I knew it.”

A changing or “revitalized” 

Detroit 
poses 
the 
slew 
of 

problems 
associated 
with 

gentrification, 
but 
the 

Heidelberg Project has been 
around through it all; it’s a 
magnetic energy from within 
the city born from the vision 
of a Detroiter who sees the 
importance of community art 
in his neighborhood, in his city 
and in the world.

“It’s a 30-year dissertation,” 

Guyton said. “I hear me. I trust 
me. I don’t have all the answers. 
I’m still learning.”

Last Sunday, I woke up at 4:45 

a.m. to run a half-marathon. It 
was pitch black outside when my 
friend Jill, my sister and I loaded 
the car, packing running shoes and 
homework for after the race. We 
shivered awake in the cold wind, 
clamping our hands around coffee 
cups. We tried not to think about 
our lack of sleep, accumulated over 
a week of exams and deadlines.

Three hours later, the pale sun 

just peeking over Grand Traverse 
Bay in Traverse City, Mich., Jill 
and I stood on the starting line of 
the Devil’s Dive Half Marathon. 
The race was an out-and-back 
course: six and a half miles out on 
a rolling (i.e. very hilly) peninsula, 
past 
vineyards 
and 
famous 

Traverse City cherry trees, then 
back to finish. We straightened our 
race bibs on our matching singlets, 
hers yellow and mine pink — 
planned ahead of time, of course, 
during our early-morning runs in 
Ann Arbor — and tightened our 
laces, popped rigid hip flexors.

The race staff shuffled around 

in Halloween costumes, googly-
eyed Minions and washed-out 
angels, arranging platters of 
caramel apples and cider for the 
post-race party. Yet there was 
still a nervous energy in the air. 
Jill and I had agreed not to stress 
about our finishing time — a hard 
promise, since we were both 
raised on cross country and track 
— but the glowing red clock at 

the starting line challenged us. 
It held expectations. The race 
director finally emerged, dressed 
in a full devil’s costume, to shoot 
the starting gun like an athletic 
exam proctor.

We readied our timers, turned 

the page and began.

At mile nine, we saw her: the 

candy corn-muncher. I’d spotted 
her earlier, during the National 
Anthem, dressed in a floor-length 
hot dog costume, shoving bags of 
candy corn and Hershey’s kisses 
in her sports bra. I had burst out 
laughing, figuring she was part of 
the staff rather than a runner. But 
here she came, a human hot dog 
with a fistful of candy corn in each 
hand, nearly half-way through a 
half marathon. 

“Way to go, girls!” the candy 

corn-muncher shouted, pumping 
the air with her candy fist.

That’s when I realized that I 

might take things too seriously. 
For every competitive runner, 
there was a candy corn-muncher. 
We 
would 
both 
accomplish 

the same feat, whether we ran 
consistently at a pace of six 
minutes, 45 seconds per mile 
or stopped at mile five to snack 
on chocolate. Was one way 
really better than the other? 
As we slugged up the final, 
mountainous hill, aptly named 
“Eternal Punishment” on the 
race posters, I wondered: Were 
we doing it wrong? 

Challenging ourselves is a 

good thing. We knew this as kids, 
when we took on the 100 Book 

Challenge in elementary school 
(what were we thinking?) and 
as University students, when 
we ambitiously registered for 18 
credits and joined the Triathlon 
Club. There’s glory in hard work 
and testing our limits, in holding 
the title of “Leaders and Best” 
that the University preaches.

The 
upside 
of 
challenging 

ourselves is recognition: placing 
in the top three of the race, scoring 
an internship with Apple. The 
downside? Unhealthy — and often 

unnecessary — levels of stress.

It’s hard to escape pressure to 

succeed as a college student, when 
midterms coincide with last week’s 
Fall Career Fair and essays are due 
the day after your half-marathon 
(or dance recital, fundraising 
event, family wedding, etc.). Multi-
tasking becomes a whole new 
monster as you recite your elevator 
pitch to yourself while running up 
the Arb hill and “tailgate” on your 
way to the law library on football 
Saturdays. And here’s the worst 
part: you feel better about pushing 
yourself instead of taking a break,

Candy corn and 

other stress busters

By KATHLEEN DAVIS

Senior Arts Editor

In 
December 
of 
2012, 
a 

University-backed video went viral 
among the alumni community, 
student 
body 
and 
Michigan 

admirers. The short video, a little 
over one minute and 30 seconds 
long, was made to celebrate the 
incoming class of 2016, using a 
single letter to symbolize the 
excitement, pride and joy of the 
Michigan experience: “The Letter 
M.” I saw it, you saw it, and your 
uncle who didn’t even go here 
saw it. The first time I watched 
the video, I was torn between 
two universities and was leaning 
a little more toward the other, but 
I remember the emotional power 
of the video was so strong that it 
helped tip me the other way.

“The Letter M,” along with 

other iconic University films, like 
the Billy Magic transportation 
musical 
shown 
at 
freshman 

orientation, is the product of 
Filmic 
productions, 
an 
elite 

student-run film club with strong 
ties to the administration. Flash 
forward a few years, and the three 
founders of Filmic — Josh Buoy, 
Roddy Hyduk and Chris Duncan 
— are still working together in 
Ann Arbor, making films for their 
burgeoning production company, 
Snowday Productions.

The three met as underclassmen 

in SAC 290: Introduction to Media 
Production, but enjoyed working 
together so much they decided to 
keep collaborating in classes, and 
eventually created Filmic.

The student organization didn’t 

start with the intention to make 
commercial 
work, 
but 
rather 

provide a platform for personal 
projects the group wanted to make. 
However, the professional quality 
of the work eventually caught the 
attention of the University, which 
hired Filmic to make around a 
couple dozen short films for them 
over the course of their remaining 
time as students. This period of 
time was crucial to Snowday’s 
current success.

“If we were just starting this 

business now and hadn’t had the 
experience on Filmic, this path 
would be so much harder,” Duncan 
said. “But since we’ve done Filmic, 
we were able to develop this 
chemistry, able to learn how to 
interact with clients and learn 
what kind of processes work best 
with different clients.”

“The University was a three-

year incubator for us,” Buoy added. 

“We were able to be a startup 
without officially being a start-up, 
which allowed us to feel really 
confident about doing this right 
after graduation.”

After 
graduation, 
the 
trio 

actually split ways for some time 
— Duncan took a copywriting job 
in Philadelphia, Hyduk was in 
New York City working for NYU, 
and Buoy stayed in Ann Arbor to 
work on a feature film. It didn’t 
take too long for them to realize 
something was off about their 
post-college endeavors.

“We realized that we weren’t 

doing as good of work individually 
as we do together,” Buoy said. 
This led to conversations about 
founding 
a 
start-up, 
which 

became Snowday.

Transitioning 
from 
making 

films as part of a club within the 
college experience to making them 
as a full-time job hasn’t been much 
of a change for the group.

“In some ways, I’d say there’s 

a lot less stress, because my mind 
isn’t being pulled between school, 
other extracurriculars and also 
filmmaking, so it’s nice to be able 
to say, ‘This is what I do full time,’ 
and you’re not stressed to get a film 
done and a paper done,” Duncan 
said. “But there’s also more stress 
in that if something didn’t work 
in Filmic, our livelihoods didn’t 
depend on it.”

Doing the best work possible is 

a mentality that carried through 
from Filmic to Snowday. Since 
the company is so small, with 
the men being the only full time 
employees amid a handful of 
contractors, all three founders 
are involved in nearly every 
aspect of production. Snowday 
believes their small size is a major 
strength to the quality of their 
work. Instead of having an idea 

for a commercial run through 
many levels of an agency and go 
through many hands, the trio 
works with the company in every 
step of the process, creating a 
very hands-on experience for 
all involved and making each 
project personal.

“It allows you to form a really 

strong 
relationship 
with 
the 

clients, it’s more than ‘We just 
want to shoot a video for you,’ 
” Buoy said. “We want to know 
why you do this, and why your 
customers act this way, and what 
causes you to wake up in the 
morning. We want to know these 
things, because it allows us to 
make a really cool project, and 
form really solid relationships that 
last beyond a small shoot.”

Since its creation, Snowday 

has 
made 
advertisements 
for 

Sisu 
Mouthguards, 
University 

of Michigan Health System and 
Trerice (an auto-part company), 
just to name a few. While the 
objects 
they’re 
selling 
seem 

innocuous, each clip feels personal, 
aesthetically driven and emotive.

Even if Snowday leaves Ann 

Arbor some day, they hope to 
always maintain the special 
relationship they have with the 
University.

“I feel confident that there’s no 

other university or institution that 
could have prepared us in such a 
unique way as the University of 
Michigan,” Buoy said. “It led us 
to have this incredible hands-on 
experience that’s kind of insane 
with what we were trusted to do 
as students. We knew when we 
started Snowday that we needed to 
come back to Ann Arbor, because 
there’s already a relationship there 
and opportunities for work, and 
we want to retain this relationship 
for the rest of our lives.”

Snowday Production director and co-founder Chris Duncan films a bonfire scene.

even if you really need one. We look 
down at tailgaters and candy corn-
munchers because success doesn’t 
come from having fun. Right?

Thankfully, 
no. 
The 

University’s 
Counseling 
and 

Psychological Services (CAPS) 
endorses 
the 
“Importance 
of 

Play” for students, writing on 
their website: “We get stuck in 
our heads thinking about all of the 
things that we have to do. Balance 
is achieved when we engage in 
things we WANT to do, not just 
things that we HAVE to do.” The 
reward of challenging ourselves — 
academically, athletically, socially, 
professionally — is counteracted 
if we don’t let ourselves breathe. 
What’s the point of climbing the 
mountain if you can’t appreciate 
the view at the top?

In our early 20s, we are the 

fittest that we’ll ever be. Our 
brains and bodies have endless 
muscle memory, enabling us to 
rebound from marathon study 
sessions and workouts stronger 
and 
more 
knowledgeable 

than before. But our fitness 
doesn’t excuse us from abusing 
our 
minds 
and 
bodies 
by 

putting them under constant, 
unnecessary stress.

To manage stress, you first 

have to accept that you can’t be 
the leader and best in everything 
you do. Frankly, it’s impossible. 
Instead, pick one or two things 
that are most important, like 
acing a biology midterm or beat-
ing a half-marathon time, then 
focus on reaching those goals. 
That way, you’ll leave room for 
your mind to breathe and have 
time to play — the true marks of 
a healthy, successful life.

And while you’re at it, eat some 

candy corn. I’ve heard it makes 
great racing fuel.

EPISODE REVIEW

 “Dead Man Walking,” 
this week’s episode of “The 
Last Man on Earth,” follows 
Phil (Will 
Forte, “Sat-
urday Night 
Live”) and 
Carol (Kris-
ten Schaal, 
“Bob’s Burg-
ers”) as 
they finally 
reunite with 
the support-
ing cast from 
the first 
season. Carol 
pretends Phil 
is dead, plan-
ning to reveal the truth once 
the others learn to forgive 
his past transgressions and 
mourn him.
 Last season’s biggest flaw 
was that the show spent 
too much time focusing on 
Phil’s cartoonishly dickish 
behavior instead of develop-
ing side characters like Gail 
(Mary Steenburgen, “Orange 
is the New Black”) and Erica 
(Cleopatra Coleman, “Neigh-
bours”). In most ways, the 

show is best suited to focus-
ing on just one or two char-
acters — and most of its best 
episodes, like this season’s 
premiere, have steered away 
from sitcom-esque hijinks 
with a big cast of characters. 
It’s slightly frustrating to 
once again veer away from 
the melancholic vibe of a two-
character show to reintroduce 
banal characters like Melissa 
(January Jones, “Mad Men”), 
especially this early in the 
season.
 That said, this season has 
made up for Phil’s question-
able characterization last 
year, giving the audience 
more reasons to empathize 
with him without taking 
away most of his core traits. 
He hilariously combines 
his old tendencies with new 
kindness in “Dead Man Walk-
ing,” holding a gun to the 
others’ heads to force them to 
listen to his sincere apology. 
If the show continues this 
focus on characterization, the 
sitcom vibe might not feel so 
wasteful anymore.

The upside of 
challenging 
ourselves is 
recognition.

The group received a break 

a few minutes later and Lauren 
came back over to talk to me. 
Moments later, Joey Richter, 2011 
Music, Theatre & Dance alum, and 
Dylan Saunders, 2009 Music, The-
atre & Dance alum, joined her and 
I was suddenly talking to a group 
of StarKids.

The Michigan Daily: So I asked 

Lauren already, but what made 
you guys decide to come back and 
do this reunion concert?

Joey Richter: Well …
Dylan Saunders: Because 

they asked us to.

Joey: Yeah.
Dylan: Yeah.
Joey: It was kind of like a 

resounding …

Dylan: No duh.
Joey: Yeah. That happened a 

couple years ago when there was 
like the third Potter thing. When 
they were like, “Does everyone 
want to come back and do this 
together?” and we were like, 
“Yeah, absolutely.” And I think 
that a lot of it has to do with being 
able to be back here, too, because 
there’s a lot of us who haven’t 
gotten the chance to spend time 
with each other a lot over the past 
couple years, but we have been 
lucky enough to be able to do a 
lot of performances with StarKid 
all over places, but I think com-
ing back together in Ann Arbor is 
something that we haven’t done 
since the concert tours. But then to 
actually perform in a school func-
tion thing is pretty cool. Not as a 
concert, but doing it like an actual 
show where we’re doing scenes 
from shows.

Dylan: Yeah, it’s good to be back 

in a spot where it’s etched forever. 
This is where we were developing 
a lot of this stuff, you know what I 
mean? It’s just cool after like a five-
year break to be back in this exact 
space. It’s just like really wild and 
really fun.

Joey: And to be developing as 

human beings.

Dylan: Totally. To look back 

with a little “Oh, OK, I get it now.”

Lauren: To look back with a 

little perspective.

Dylan: Yeah. There’s a ton of 

that.

(Darren Criss sits and joins the 

conversation.)

TMD: What was the last show 

you guys remember doing on this 
stage?

Lauren: I was in a show called 

“J.B.” with Dylan. Dylan played 
J.B. It was a big deal.

Joey: I was in “Macbeth.”
Lauren: Don’t … you can’t say 

that in here!

Joey: Whoops.
Lauren: What’s wrong with 

you?

Darren: You totally can say it.
Lauren: No you can’t.
Joey: I was in “The Scottish 

Play.” We said the name during 
the play.

Lauren: Just forget it.
Joey: I was Banquo.
Dylan: Um, yeah. The last thing 

I did was “Tommy” and “Pride & 
Prejudice.”

Darren: You were so good in 

“Tommy.”

TMD: How do you feel the Uni-

versity helped get you where you 
are now?

Joey: Honestly, for me it just 

has everything to do with meet-
ing the friends I met here. It’s like 
if I didn’t go to this University and 
meet all these friends and have 
all these people that are the only 
people I spend time with now in 
my life …

Lauren: My life would be 100 

percent different.

Joey: Exactly. My life would 

be 100 percent different.

Dylan: As a foundation, this 

set the stage for everything 
that’s happened since. Like lit-
erally everything.

Darren: When I first went 

out to L.A. and started meeting 
people in the industry, it was 
predicated upon the fact that I 
went to Michigan.

Lauren: Yeah. U of M has 

such a crazy alumni network.

Dylan: All of our first agents 

went to Michigan.

***

Darren: I think this is the part 

where we’re supposed to talk 
about how great the School of 
Music was. I always feel bad when 
people are like, “What was the best 
part about Michigan?” and I go, 
“My friends, uh, the times I had.” 
It all has nothing to do with the 
actual institution. For most theatre 
people, artisan types, stereotypical 
kids from high school, they tend 
to gravitate toward small, liberal 
arts colleges because it’s just sort 
of the vibe of the school, it’s just 
a bit more typical. And somebody 
told me, “You can always make a 
big place small, you can’t make a 
small place big.” The cool thing 
about this school is, yeah, there are 
30,000 kids running around and 
our class was anywhere from 16 to 
20-odd people, so we had our tiny 
little community, and it was great.

Dylan: It was a tiny family 

within a giant operation.

Joey: It was like being in 

a mixed-gender sorority and 
fraternity.

Darren: So we had the small 

thing, and if the small thing ever 
got annoying, we had the big thing.

Dylan: And being able to 

switch back and forth is great, 
especially when you’re studying 
an art form. Do you know what I 
mean? Because you need a break 
sometimes.

Darren: Because there’s a 

huge chunk of people at this Uni-
versity who don’t know anything 
about theatre or the department, 
and I’m fine with that.

Dylan: Which is so fine. 

Which is all good because …

Darren: I don’t know things 

about certain parts of the math 
department, 
which 
is 
cool 

because when I’m on the bus, 
(I’m like), oh cool, you do what? 
Awesome. That’s amazing.

TMD: Has the dynamic 

changed in the group since you 
graduated?

Dylan: Other than geographi-

cally, I mean, not really.

Lauren: We’re all a tiny, tiny 

bit more mature, but other than 
that it’s pretty much the same.

Darren: We’re still dumb 

enough to be doing this, so 
that’s good.

Lauren: Yeah, we’re dumb in 

the right places.

TMD: Has being so spread 

out made it harder to keep doing 
projects together?

Dylan: I think so, but the 

advantage is that everything 
is ultimately produced for the 
Internet.

Joey: But then it’s always 

really special when it happens. 
It always feels like a reunion. 
It’s like every time we do do 
something, it’s that feeling: 
“Ahh, I get to see all these peo-
ple again.”

TMD: Are you guys working 

on any upcoming projects?

Lauren: A lot of people are 

doing their own side projects.

Joey: I am going to be writ-

ing and producing a musical 
with my sketch group, the Tin 
Can Bros that Brian (Rosenthal) 
and Corey (Lubowich) are in, 
and that’s happening in L.A. in 
March. And we’re kick-start-
ing that right now. Joe Walker 
is going to be in it and, like, a 
bunch of other friends, so that’s 
pretty fun.

Dylan: Yeah, it’s a lot of indi-

vidual pursuits. I just finished a 
cartoon for Nickelodeon, which 
aired last week.

We’re dumb in 
the right places.


T

he alumni base of the 
University of Michigan 
is a common selling 

point, in both quantity (over 
540,000 currently) and quality. 
We’d like to 
think that the 
University is 
both nature 
and nurture 
— that we 
attract the 
very best 
and then 
launch them 
into fame 
and fortune. 
Every wide-
eyed freshman is told that 
if he studies enough, he can 
become the next Arthur Miller, 
the next Larry Page, the next 
Gerald Ford. Included among 
our esteemed alumni are sev-
eral renowned chefs. Gabrielle 
Hamilton, award-winning chef 
at Prune in New York City, 
received an MFA in creative 
writing from the University. 
Stephanie Izard, winner of Sea-
son Four of “Top Chef,” was an 
undergraduate here. It’s harder 
to pin down the University’s 
influence on a chef. We don’t 
have a culinary school beyond 
work-study jobs in the dining 
hall. Chefs are often of a more 
bohemian temperament, one 
not predisposed to college. 
Which begs the question — if 
one wants to be a chef, why 
would you come here?

If you’re Chef Tony Maws, 

James Beard Award-winning 
chef of Craigie on Main in 
Cambridge, Mass., it’s because 
you’re 18 years old, and you 
don’t know that you want to be 

a chef or even know that you can 
be one.

“I don’t think as an 18-year-

old, I was really mature enough, 
or put together enough, to have 
those thoughts,” he told me over 
the phone. “(Going to college) 
was what I was supposed to do.” 

When 
I 
first 
found 
out 

Maws had graduated from the 
University, I was surprised, to 
say the least. I grew up around 
Boston, and Maws was often a 
source for anything especially 
“cheffy.” When I wanted to learn 
how to fillet a fish, I watched 
his videos on youtube. When I 
turned 14 and wanted a roasted 
pig’s head instead of a cake, 
Craigie on Main was the place to 
go. In short, Maws did not seem 
like a guy who took a circuitous 
route towards becoming a chef.

Maws was born in Boston 

and grew up in Newton, Mass., 
in a solidly middle-class family. 
When he was a kid, his parents 
decided to renovate their house, 
and were left without a kitchen 
for more than a month. They’d 
often trek to Chinatown for 
dinner, which had an in-your-
face cuisine that appealed to 
their young son.

“I grew up seeing all the 

animals hanging in the window, 
eating 
funky 
parts, 
seeing 

food differently than a lot of 
Americans probably were in the 
’70s,” Maws said.

Starting in seventh grade, 

Maws attended an elite prep 
school, Belmont Hill, throwing 
himself into academics and 
sports. But with nothing to 
do one summer on Martha’s 
Vineyard, where his family had 
a house, he decided to get a job. 
He approached the job process 
like only a 15-year-old prep 
school kid would: writing up a 
resumé and diligently sending it 
out to restaurants on the Island. 
Looking back, Maws proudly 
laughed.

“I got a call about three 

minutes later, saying ‘You sent 
us a resumé for a dishwasher 
job? You’re hired.’”

Maws spent the next few 

summers washing dishes and 
helping prep ingredients at the 
Beach Plum Inn. He’d never 
been happier.

“It really embodied a lot of 

what I liked and it was a culture I 
thrived in — loud, fast, physical, 
it was almost like playing in a 
hockey game,” he said.

From his dishwashing sta-

tion, he would often peer into 
the kitchen, admiring the hus-
tle of the line cooks. They were 
usually college students, and, 
funnily enough, one summer 
they were a group of fraternity 
brothers from the University of 
Michigan.

“My 
freshman 
year 
at 

Michigan, I ran into a bunch of 
them on the street — they must 
have been fifth-year seniors — 
and they were like ‘Wait, you’re 

that kid!’” he said.

When he graduated from high 

school, Maws still loved working 
in kitchens, but didn’t think of it 
as anything more than a hobby.

“At 
that 
time, 
I 
wasn’t 

thinking, ‘Oh, I’m gonna be a 
chef,’” he said. “There wasn’t 
any food TV, and (becoming 
a chef) wasn’t something that 
people like me would do.”

So 
Maws 
zeroed 
in 
on 

Michigan for college. Several 
members of his family had 
attended the University, and the 
charisma of the line cooks had 
made an impression. After one 
visit, he made the decision.

“I got to Michigan and I was 

like, ‘Holy shit! This is college,’” 
he said.

Like so many freshman, his 

first year was, in his own words, 
“a wash.” The kitchen hadn’t 
prepared him for the shock of 
400-person classes, of teachers 
who didn’t take attendance or 
check his homework, of some 
new party to go to every night. 
Stuck on North Campus, he was 
so miserable that he would pack 
a bag every Friday afternoon 
and crash with friends who 
lived in Mary Markley Hall for 
the weekend.

And, like so many students, 

things got better after that. He 
joined a frat. He took enough 
psychology classes to make 
a major of it. He wrote short 
stories and poetry. And, at night, 
he worked at the now-defunct 
Quality Bar on Main Street, just 
to be in the kitchen again.

After graduation, his friends 

went off to New York and 
Chicago to work at banks and 
attend law and medical school. 
Maws loaded up his car and 
drove to Montana.

He worked at a lodge for a 

while, moved to Utah to ski bum, 
packed up again and traveled 
through Europe. He even had a 
desk job at a magazine in New 
York City. This vagabond period 
wasn’t exactly Maws living 
out some latent Jack Kerouac 
fantasy.

“I wasn’t trying to be aimless, 

in an irresponsible way,” he 
said. “I just didn’t know what I 
wanted to do, and it really began 
to eat at me.”

Maws ended up back in 

Martha’s Vineyard, this time 
waiting tables. He got friendly 
with the restaurant’s owner, 
who pulled him aside one day 
for a verbal slap across the face.

He said, “Wait a minute. 

You’ve worked in kitchens all 
these years. You love food. 
You’re always hanging around 
in the kitchen. Why aren’t you 
doing this?”

Looking 
back, 
Maws 

considers this the turning point.

“It 
was 
as 
if 
I 
needed 

permission from someone to do 
this job I liked,” he said.

He traveled again, to Boston, 

San 
Francisco 
and 
France, 

cooking six days a week, coming 
in on his days off, forgoing 
culinary school for countless 
questions 
asked 
and 
hours 

worked. In 2003, he opened the 
Craigie Street Bistro, which 
moved to its present location 
in 2008. In 2011, he won the 
James Beard Award for Best 
Chef — Northeast. He’s now 
married and has a young son, 
and still cooks most nights at 
the restaurant.

So, all in all, was that 

psychology degree worth it?

“I went to prep school, and I 

was supposed to go to college, so 
I did,” Maws said. “And I’m glad 
I did. I thought Ann Arbor was 
fantastic, and I’m glad I have the 
education.”

The 
psychology 
education 

specifically, he’s not sure — 
most of his leadership ability 
has come from experience, not 
reading Freud. But just to go 
to college, to have four years to 
grow up and learn what he liked 
and didn’t like ... yeah, that was 
worth it.

SINGLE REVIEW

 You know that electronic 
song that you, your friends 
and everyone here at The 
Daily likes 
that goes 
“Thump 
Thump 
Thump 
Thump” then 
ends? Let’s 
agree, cut 
that shit out 
for a sec and talk about some-
thing with enough acoustic 
nourishment to hold you from 
your 9 a.m. ’til the smells, 
lights and chatter fade out 
of MoJo. Nicolas Jaar, the 
exemplar of electronico-com-
positional mastery, outdoes 
himself on this one.

 “Fight” is a well-thought-
out meditation on a simple 
five-chord structure that 
develops through recapitu-
lations of groove, feel and 
sonic exaction. Far and away 
the most incredible aspect 
of “Fight” is Jaar’s virtuosic 
synth design. The sounds and 
textures he crafts throughout 
the piece are percussively 
dense, yet symphonically 
clear. The affected reverb 
that trails behind is exact 
enough to prevent a muddled 
crash while clear enough, to 
promote harmonic mingling 
and a wee tingle in me knick-
ers. This track is gorgeous 
through and through.

TRAILER REVIEW

 The first shot is of an idyllic, 
modern home secluded in the 
Austrian countryside, which 
clearly means 
someone’s 
going to die. 
I don’t think 
there’s ever 
been a film 
with an idyllic, 
secluded home 
that made me 
think, “This looks like a feel good 
story. No one could possibly die 
in this.” 
“Goodnight Mommy” looks ter-
rifying, astonishingly terrifying, 
the kind of horror film that seeps 
under the skin and claws its way 
around so you can feel the hairs 
standing on your arms, the tight-

ening of your stomach. Though 
the trailer provides a couple 
jump scares, the focus looks to 
be of a psychological terror, one 
that will stain your mind with 
grotesque images like a pierc-
ing bloodshot eye or the rapid 
frame movement of a woman 
writhing, seemingly possessed, 
in the wilderness. And it keeps 
its secrets guarded closely to its 
chest, leaving so many questions: 
Why did this mother receive 
facial reconstruction surgery? Is 
she even these kids’ mother? Are 
these kids the spawn of Satan? 
And where did they find so many 
cockroaches? 
So many questions, so many 
thrills, outrageous fun.

Werenski a bright spot in downward trend
I

t was 3:00 in the afternoon 
on March 26. Red Berenson 
walked into the media room 

at Yost Ice Arena, took a seat in 
his usual chair and drank two 
sips of black coffee before saying 
a word. Disappointment flowed 
through his body.

His team’s 

captain, 
Andrew 
Copp, had 
just decided 
to forgo his 
senior season, 
opting to 
sign with the 
Winnipeg Jets 
on a deal that 
Copp would 
later say was too good to pass 
up. But to the Michigan coach, 
no offer could surpass becoming 
a two-time captain and playing 
your senior season at Michigan.

“I just wish he would stay and 

do it right — graduate with your 
teammates and classmates and 
take this team to another level,” 
Berenson said at the time. “I 
just told Andrew that I hope he 
makes it and plays in the NHL 
next year because I will feel sick 
if he is playing in the minors 
and giving up his senior year at 
Michigan to play in the American 
Hockey League.”

Copp has since defied the odds 

and landed a spot on the Jets’ 
roster. However, Berenson has 
seen too many players leave early 
and not make it to the highest 
level. Phillip Di Guiseppe hasn’t 
played an NHL game. Neither 
has Alex Guptill, or even Chris 
Brown, a former first-round pick 
who played just two seasons at 
Michigan. And that’s just a small 
sample.

Sure, Copp’s decision was his 

to make, and it already looks 
like he made the correct choice. 
However, the odds weren’t 
initially high.

When any 21-year-old is 

presented with an offer for 
just under one million dollars 
— knowing he could also get 
severely hurt in his senior season 
— it’s too hard and too much 
cash to pass up. But who is to say, 
injury aside, that Copp or Guptill 
or Brown wouldn’t have received 
a similar offer the year after?

“When the money is there, you 

have to go,” said St. Louis Blues 
head coach Ken Hitchcock, who 
was in Ann Arbor for a team 

practice. “It’s the tough nature 
of the business. You’d like that to 
change, though.”

That’s a tough pill to swallow 

for college hockey fans.

It’s a shame that the NHL 

franchises are prying prospects 
away from college just to ensure 
control, even if it’s detrimental 
to their development. And it’s a 
shame that players buy into these 
often-false promises and realities.

ophomore defenseman 
Zach Werenski watched 
Copp leave. He watched his 

former roommate Dylan Larkin 
sign his deal. And he watched 
Noah Hanifin, the fifth pick of the 
draft and one of his best friends, 
turn pro.

But Werenski wasn’t so keen 

on that route. Yet. He understood 
his time to play in the show would 
come.

“When you take a step back and 

talk with your family,” Werenski 
said, “you realize everyone has a 
different path.”

On March 22, when Michigan 

lost in the Big Ten title game 
to Minnesota, Werenski wasn’t 
thinking about his future. He 
was disappointed he let down 
his senior class and only thought 
of avenging the loss, saying the 
Wolverines had “unfinished 
business.”

But that quickly changed in 

June when he attended the NHL 

combine.

“I talked to a lot of teams at the 

combine,” Werenski said. “There 
were some teams that said if we 
draft you and we tell you to leave, 
you have to leave. But other teams 
like Columbus said I could do 
whatever I wanted.

“It’s tough when an NHL team 

comes to you and says you can 
shine and try and make our team, 
because that is ultimately your 
dream, right?”

He’s right. It’s the dream of all 

these players. But the idea that an 
NHL team would demand a player 
skip the four best years of his life, 
sometimes 
against his 
will, to bus 
around the 
United States, 
playing in front 
of smaller 
crowds than 
Yost Ice Arena 
is sickening. 
Shocking, really.

And it only got worse as 

Werenski clarified the process.

“It’s not like they say, ‘If we 

take you, you’re coming,’ ” he said. 
“There was one team, I won’t 
name the team, that told me, ‘If 
we take you, and say that you 
can play in the NHL, would you 
come?’ And you just say yes or no. 
And obviously it’s a yes because 
it’s the NHL.

“And then they go, ‘If we take 

you and we say you’re going to the 
AHL will you go?’ They go based 

on your word. So if you tell them 
yes, then the guy looks at you says, 
‘Well you just said yes, so if we 
take you and you go against your 
word, then you are dead to us.’ ”

Dead to us? Really? How many 

18-year olds are the saviors of a 
franchise, anyway? Sure, there 
were Sidney Crosby, Jonathan 
Toews and Patrick Kane. Perhaps 
Connor McDavid, touted as the 
next Wayne Gretzky before even 
playing one pro game, will join 
that list. But those are once-in-
a-decade players. What about 
the hundreds of others who end 
up busing between Milwaukee, 

Rockford, 
Albany, 
Syracuse, 
Orlando, Fort 
Wayne and 
more? You 
don’t hear 
about those. 
And probably 
never will.

The fact that Werenski felt 

“relieved” when Columbus drafted 
him because teams drafting 
around them would force him to 
bolt the place he loved is a sobering 
reality. Even worse, he’s not the 
only player who feels that way.

S

teve Shields won 111 games 
as Michigan’s goalie 
from 1990-94. He led the 

Wolverines to two Frozen Four 
appearances and went on to play 

12 seasons in the NHL.

He understands the process. 

He knows players who have 
taken every route to the pros. So 
it annoys Shields when players 
leave college with the allure of 
accomplishing their dream only 
to be placed in the AHL — or even 
a lower league — and miss out on 
their junior and senior seasons.

“The experience when you’re 

here, you can never duplicate,” 
Shields said of Michigan. “Of all 
the guys I have ever spoken to, 
I have never met one guy who 
left and said he was glad he was 
playing in the American Hockey 
League or lower.

“If guys are leaving because 

teams are promising them time 
in the minors with a chance to 
come up to the NHL, that’s not 
the reason I went to school. That’s 
not why most guys go to school. 
That’s not why their parents want 
them to go to school.”

Werenski realized this — a 

rarity today, which is odd 
considering many players have 
had NHL success after four 
years of college. Berenson 
cites Columbus Blue Jackets 
defenseman Jack Johnson and 
former Hobey Baker-winner 
Brendan Morrison as players 
who benefited from staying all 
four years. Both went on to have 
successful NHL careers with 
little time spent in the AHL.

Shields and Berenson do admit, 

though, that there are times 
when players are ready. Jacob 
Trouba, for example, left after 
his freshman season in 2013 and 
ended up making an immediate 
impact in Winnipeg. Larkin and 
Copp are a couple others. But they 
are not the majority.

“When you are ready or over 

ready, you get to jump in and 
make a splash,” Shields said. “But 
when you’re not ready and you 
jump in and don’t make a splash, 
then the team is already looking 
at the next guy coming up.”

So why not wait? Will a team 

really pass on your potential if 
you simply want to stay in college 
an extra year? As Berenson noted, 
until a player signs his contract, 
they “are in the driver’s seat.”

Werenski figured that out. Now, 

he’ll have an opportunity to lead 
Michigan back to the Frozen Four.

All roads lead back to 
Ann Arbor, Berenson 

for former players

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

It’s early October, but the sound 

of a hockey player’s symphony still 
echoes through Yost Ice Arena.

Skates scratch over the fresh ice, 

sticks clack against the puck, hollers 
of approval ring after finding twine.

But on this day, the symphony’s 

orchestrators aren’t members of the 
Michigan hockey team. Instead, the 
melody is produced by members of 
the coaching staff — an ensemble of 
former Wolverines who have hung 
up their skates in exchange for a 
whistle and clipboard.

Even when the team has a day 

off from skating, the coaching staff 
relishes the opportunity to play on 
the ice where they once molded 
their own careers.

“We’re hoping to make it a 

weekly event,” said undergraduate 
assistant coach Mike Komisarek. 
“Get a little competition going 

between ourselves, and we all love 
being out there.”

Added 
associate 
head 
coach 

Billy Powers: “I think Fridays, 
we’re gonna try to get out and start 
reliving the old days.”

The “old days” for each coach — 

Powers, Komisarek, assistant coach 
Brian Wiseman, goaltending coach 
Steve Shields and undergraduate 
director of player development L.J. 
Scarpace — compose the timeline 
of the program’s evolution during 
head coach Red Berenson’s tenure.

And above all else, the unique 

coaching staff comprised entirely 
of 
former 
Michigan 
players 

symbolizes one thing: No matter the 
different paths their lives may take, 
all roads have led back to Berenson, 
in what could be his final season as 
Michigan’s head coach.

***

Powers was the first coach to take 

the road back to Ann Arbor, when 
he remained with the club at the 
conclusion of his collegiate career 
in 1988.

A member of Berenson’s first 

recruiting class in 1985, prior to the 
program’s dominance in the 1990s 

and early 2000s, Powers signed up 
to represent the Wolverines at a 
time when “guys had been so used 
to losing.”

Michigan compiled a 41-70-2 

record in the three years leading up 
to his commitment.

But the record didn’t matter to 

him. His coach did. In retrospect, 
the first thing he recalls about 
that time was Berenson’s drive 

and determination to establish a 
standard of excellence.

For Berenson’s first five years, 

Powers witnessed his coach set out 
on a recruiting mission, traveling to 
Toronto and getting back at 3 a.m. 
for a practice the next day. All along, 
he knew Berenson would get it 
done. It was that drive that brought 
Powers back to stay years later. 

His passion and confidence were 

infectious, and Powers came down 
with every symptom.

“I was always like, ‘Man, he cares 

more than half our team does.’ I was 
so impressed with how he attacked 
it,” Powers said. “I remember that 
part, and through the good things 
and mostly the bad things because 
we were losing, he never wavered. It 
wasn’t a big secret. Red was all into 
it. He was gonna turn this program 
around. There was no question in 
his mind.”

As both a player and a graduate 

assistant coach in 1988 and 1989, 
Powers watched as the influx of 
freshmen 
followed 
Berenson, 

each year the quality of players 
improving.

Powers’ prophecy that Berenson 

would change things in Ann Arbor 
came true, as the Wolverines 
improved to 116-81-14 in the five 
years after his freshman season.

Though Powers left Michigan 

with former Michigan assistant 
coach Larry Pedrie for a two-
year coaching stint at Illinois-
Chicago, his positive memories 
drew him back to Yost for good — 
an attraction he’s highlighted as 
one of the main reasons so many 
former players have returned.

“(For) the majority of players 

that leave, this was the best 
time,” Powers said. “This was 
where I learned the most, where 
I had the most fun. This is where 
I evolved. You’re kinda drawn 
back to where things have been 
really good for you, where you 
feel you’ve grown the most as a 
person.” 

For Powers, the opportunity 

to come back has been special. 
Once a piece of Berenson’s 
earliest recruiting efforts to turn 
the program around, Powers 
now plays his own part, pushing 
the program far past the times 
of the losing seasons that he 
remembered.

He 
coached 
players 
like 

Wiseman, 
Shields 
and 

Komisarek, who catapulted the 
Wolverines to an era of glory 
featuring 22 straight NCAA 
tournament appearances.

He watched as they all made 

the pilgrimage back to Yost 
to invigorate the present-day 

roster. Now entering his 23rd 
season as a member of the staff, 
Powers coaches alongside them, 
ensuring that Michigan never 
returns to the dark days when 
losing was the norm.

***

After 
Powers 
came 
L.J. 

Scarpace, the second to return to 
coach at Michigan.

He entered Yost for the first 

time when it was a mecca for 
college hockey, an antithesis of 
the program that existed before 
Powers’ playing career.

Upon 
Scarpace’s 
arrival, 

Berenson had already established 
his vision for supremecy. The 
Wolverines were coming off of 
two 
national 
championships 

in three years, and Berenson 
no longer needed to foster his 
players’ desire to win. The 
Wolverines’ winning pedigree 
did that itself.

“I 
remember 
feeling 
so 

fortunate to be part of the 
program, and the feeling of 
expectation, whether it was the 
fans’ or whether it was coach 
and his expectations for you as a 
student-athlete,” Scarpace said. 
“We had a feeling those years 
that I was here that we gotta 
keep this thing going. These are 
big expectations, and nobody 
wanted to let the fans and the 
program down.”

Scarpace was a goaltender on 

teams that earned CCHA titles 
and Frozen Four berths in 2000 
and 2001, respectively. He spent 
a year playing professionally in 
the East Coast Hockey League 
but, like Powers, answered the 
call back to Michigan in 2004 
to become the team’s video 
coordinator.

Though he knew that Berenson 

advocated for his former players 
to find their own paths outside 
of hockey, he couldn’t shake the 
recollections of what his coach 
did for him during his college 
years.

Scarpace never forgot the role 

Berenson played in developing 
him, not just on the ice, but 
as a young adult. This ignited 
a passion to pass those same 
lessons on to current players.

After being appointed director 

of player development in 2014, 
Scarpace now leaves the same 
lasting impact on players that 
Berenson left with him.

While he does influence the 

players’ success on the ice, he 
more 
directly 
cherishes 
the 

chance to help develop players in 

the classroom, preparing them for a 
life after they let go of the game they 
love.

As Scarpace mentors young men, 

not just hockey players, he never 
forgets the lessons he learned from 
his former coach.

“Coach used to joke with me 

when I first started back here, and 
I was video coordinator for many 
years. He would tease me and say, 
‘Well maybe you should be paying 
us, you’re getting a master’s degree 
in coaching,’ ” Scarpace said. “I’d 
laugh, but that’s how I feel. … It’s 
helped me now (with) what I’m 
doing, I know I’m more prepared 
to do it now than I’ve ever been, 
because of being around Coach.”

***

The legacy Scarpace stepped 

into during his collegiate career 
was partly built by Wiseman and 
Shields.

The two lifelong friends were 

roommates 
as 
Wolverines. 
As 

members of the program’s golden 

age, their times at Michigan were 
the fruits of Berenson and Powers’ 
labor.

They both made appearances 

in the 1992 and 1993 Frozen 
Fours, 
laying 
the 
groundwork 

before the Wolverines’ national 
championships in 1996 and 1998 
that Scarpace narrowly missed 
being a part of.

Those 
are 
the 
teams 
that 

Wiseman envisions for this program 
going forward.

Berenson 
and 
Powers’ 

expectations 
for 
success 
and 

Wiseman’s 
own 
collegiate 

experience 
have 
become 
like 

gasoline thrown on the fire, fueling 
a belief that the program should be 
nothing short of the greatness that 
was celebrated in the ’90s.

“To look back now, we were part 

of a pretty good era. … After our 
class left in 1994, they took another 
step forward with the two national 
championships,” 
Wiseman 
said. 

“We’re trying to build and get that 
back. Tight teams, close teams, 
worked very hard, respected one 
another on and off the ice. But 
pushed one another as well. I think 
our team has the makings of that 
type of mindset and team frame.”

Wiseman, a Hobey Baker finalist 

in 1993, led Michigan in scoring 
with 19 goals and 50 assists, while 
Shields was the first goalie in NCAA 
history to reach 100 wins.

Both spent time in the National 

Hockey League, but they had 
very different paths back to the 
Wolverines’ coaching staff.

Wiseman’s professional career 

was derailed by concussions, and 
when that struggle presented itself, 

the first person he turned to was 
Berenson.

He returned to Michigan to coach 

while rehabbing the injury in hopes 
of being able to play professionally 
again, but in two years, he was 
never cleared by doctors.

Two years later, with a young 

daughter and a wife back in Texas, 
Wiseman gave up coaching to be 
with his family and entered the oil 
and gas business back in Houston 
for roughly eight years.

Then came the itch — the same 

itch that Powers and Scarpace felt 
after leaving Berenson behind in 
Ann Arbor.

He spent the next year as an 

assistant coach under Mike Yeo in 
the NHL minor leagues.

Then Berenson answered the call 

again.

Former 
Michigan 
associate 

head coach Mel Pearson had just 
accepted a head coaching position at 
Michigan Tech, and, in Berenson’s 
eyes, Wiseman was the man to fill 
the open position.

“I was always 
like, ‘Man, he 

cares more than 
half our team.’ ”

Assistant coach Brian Wiseman spent eight years in the oil and gas business while living with his family in Houston. Then, he got the itch to coach again, so Red Berenson brought him back to Ann Arbor.

approval, 
and 
Wiseman 
was 

reunited with his old coach, 
becoming 
the 
third 
former 

Wolverine to join the coaching 
staff. He emphasized the tie he 
has always felt to this program 
as the factor that allowed him to 
come back to Ann Arbor.

“I used to call back here all 

the time. I followed the program 
and their success that they had 
when I was away from here and 
not even involved in hockey,” 
Wiseman said. “You always have 
a connection here. We have this 
alumni event — we had over seven 
decades of hockey players show 
up. It’s a unique association that 
Red’s built here. Once you’re a part 
of it, you’re always a part of it.”

***

The connection that Wiseman 

felt 
wasn’t 
an 
anomaly. 
For 

Shields, he was always certain of 
one thing: He felt like Ann Arbor 
was a second home, and he wanted 
to come back.

Though Wiseman and Shields 

went their separate ways in 1994, 
they never lost touch, eventually 
allowing Shields to fulfill his 

dream of returning to Yost.

The timing couldn’t have been 

more perfect for Shields. After 
retiring from a 12-year NHL 
career, Berenson and Wiseman 
reached out to him when Josh 
Blackburn could no longer serve 
as the goaltender coach.

Entering his sixth month as 

a member of the staff, Shields’ 
impact has already made a mark.

Described as “the biggest kid 

on the ice” by junior goaltender 
Zach Nagelvoort, Shields has 
become a refreshing presence in 
the Wolverines’ locker room.

“(The players feel) way more 

comfortable,” 
Powers 
said. 

“And these two, like Shields and 
Komisarek, just the blending in 
with these guys is unbelievable. 
They don’t have to be a ‘coach.’ 
They’re more like a help or guide. 
So they can really have a pretty 
unique relationship that we can’t 
have with the players.”

Even now, pretty much every 

night after work, Shields ends 
up with Wiseman and his family 
hanging out.

“I’m basically part of Wiseman’s 

family at this point,” Shields said. 
“I’m just always around.”

The 
pair’s 
relationship 
is 

representative of the broader 
connection 
that 
this 
hockey 

fraternity provides, the same one 
that brought these coaches back 
together.

***

Komisarek is the final piece 

of the coaching staff, an 11-year 
NHL veteran who returned to the 
program just a year before Shields 
as an undergraduate assistant 
coach.

Like Shields and Wiseman, 

Komisarek suited up for the 
Wolverines during a period of 
dominance, playing in two of the 
eight Frozen Fours that Michigan 

reached in an 11-year span.

And like every other coach that 

came before him, it was Berenson 
who supplied the road map for his 
return.

After 
retiring 
in 
2014, 

Komisarek met with Berenson, 
who was adamant about his old 
blueliner coming back to finish his 
degree. With the degree also came 
an opportunity to help with the 
hockey team.

Once 
that 
conversation 

happened, 
Berenson 
recruited 

Komisarek as fervently as he 
recruited players back in 1985, 
calling him every couple weeks 
asking if he had found a house in 
Ann Arbor yet.

Berenson 
was 
the 
reason 

Komisarek became a Wolverine in 
2000 and the reason he returned 
to complete his education last 
year. Now, Komisarek is giving 
back the same passion that his old 
coach showed for him.

“I’m from Long Island, Yankee 

Stadium, you know, the House 
That Ruth Built. Everytime I 
come to this building, I see Yost, 
I see the exterior,” Komisarek 
said. “I walk in. I see the stands 
and the press box, the balcony and 

everything that they’ve done in 
here is because of Red Berenson. I 
don’t think about when he’s going 
to leave or when that day (will) 
come, but making sure that the 
way he started and the way he 
built this program is the way he’s 
going to leave.

“It’s about getting back to where 

we were, where we’re supposed to 
be.”

Berenson, in many ways the 

program’s patriarch, will begin 
his 32nd season as Michigan’s 
coach Friday night. Nobody says 
much about when that run might 
come to an end and what will 
follow it, but as the coaches skated 
on the Yost ice once more, that 
scene might have been glimpse.

You could see into the past. You 

could see the foundation Berenson 
built and the people who forged 
the Michigan hockey program 
into what it is today.

And the next day, when the 

Wolverines went back to practice, 
you could see the present.

Now, given the history that 

lives through these coaches, and 
the talent these players possess, 
maybe we know what’s to come in 
the future. 

“It’s about getting 
back to where we 
were, where we’re 
supposed to be.”

Breaking down Big Ten hockey

Minnesota remains 
toughest competition 

as league rebuilds 
after down year

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

On Sept. 28, the No. 11 Michigan 

hockey team was picked to take 
the Big Ten title in a preseason 
coaches’ poll. With many pundits 
having a similar opinion, it seems 
that the Big Ten crown will be the 
Wolverines’ to lose. 

But 
the 
real 
question 
is 

whether the Big Ten can make the 
jump to an elite college hockey 
conference after losing nine of its 
top 12 scorers from last season.

With the league slate kicking 

off on Dec. 4, when all six teams 
begin 
conference 
play, 
the 

Daily breaks down Michigan’s 
competition in the Big Ten.

1. Minnesota (No. 9)

A first-round exit in the 2015 

NCAA Tournament to in-state 
foe Minnesota-Duluth started a 
tough offseason for Don Lucia’s 
squad. Gone from the team are 
its top three point-scorers from 
a year ago in Mike Reilly, Kyle 
Rau and Travis Boyd, who have 
all moved on to the National 
Hockey League. In their absence, 
two Big Ten Preseason Players 
to Watch, forwards Justin Kloos 
and Hudson Fasching, will need 
to ramp up their production.

But 
perhaps 
the 
most 

important offseason loss was 
goaltender Adam Wilcox, a Mike 
Richter 
Award 
nominee 
last 

season. Wilcox also bolted for 
the NHL a year early and leaves 
behind a huge hole between the 
pipes. The Golden Gophers will 
look to freshman netminder Eric 
Schierhorn, the reigning USHL 
and USA Hockey Goaltender of 
the Year, to fill the void.

After a season-opening loss 

to Vermont — Minnesota’s first 
season-opening loss in six seasons 
— things will not get easier, as the 
Golden Gophers will face a tough 
nonconference slate that includes 
No. 7 Minnesota-Duluth, No. 12 St. 
Cloud State and No. 14 Minnesota 
State before the Big Ten opener 
against Ohio State.

2. Michigan State

With 
goaltender 
Jake 

Hildebrand in net for his senior 
season, the Spartans will be 
competitive in just about every 
single game. The reigning Big 
Ten Player and Goaltender of the 
Year will look to continue from an 
impressive 2014-2015 campaign 
that saw him post six shutouts, 
good for second in the NCAA.

But the big question for the 

Spartans will center on the 
players in front of Hildebrand. 
After losing its top scorer, Matt 
Berry, to graduation, Michigan 
State 
will 
rely 
on 
forward 

Mackenzie 
MacEachern 
to 

improve on his career-high 26 
points from a season ago.

On the other side of the ice, 

defenseman Travis Lynch will 
lead a defense that will try to 
improve on an impressive season 
in which the unit gave up just 80 
goals.

After opening their season 

with a draw against Maine and 
a 4-1 victory over Lake Superior 
State, the Spartans will have 
three tough games on the road — 
two at No. 5 Denver and another 

at No. 4 Boston College. They will 
also open their Big Ten slate on 
the road at Penn State.

3. Penn State

In just its third season as a 

Division I team, Guy Gadowsky’s 
squad is on the rise and gunning 
for a top-three finish in the Big 
Ten.

That jump in prestige, though, 

is going to have to come without 
forwards Casey Bailey and Taylor 
Holmstrom — the Nittany Lions’ 
top two scorers in their short 
history — as well as defenseman 
and 
former 
captain 
Patrick 

Koudys.

But there is not a lack of talent 

in the offense, and it starts with 
David Goodwin and Eric Schneid. 
The duo combined for 63 points 
last season and will need to pick 
up the pace if Penn State is to 
make any noise this season.

Between 
the 
pipes, 
Matt 

Skoff and Eamon McAdam will 
likely continue to split time as 
the Nittany Lions search for 
consistency. 
Freshman 
Chris 

Funkey, who led the United States 
Premier Hockey League in goals-

against average for two straight 
years, may push for playing time, 
but it looks like the duo of Skoff 
and McAdam will have to carry 
Penn State.

4. Ohio State

Of all the teams in the Big 

Ten, the Buckeyes probably lost 
the least amount of talent this 
offseason. But after a fifth-place 
finish in the Big Ten last season, 
Ohio State will still need to 
improve is to climb further up the 
conference standings.

Most of the offense will run 

through 
forwards 
Anthony 

Greco and Nick Schilkey, while 
forward Matthew Weis will look 
to improve upon a strong second 
half of the season that saw him 
score 14 of his 22 points.

In goal, the Buckeyes will stick 

with the tandem of Christian Frey 
and Matt Tomkins while Craig 
Dalrymple, the only senior on the 
blue line, will be relied upon to 
lead the young defensive unit that 
has just three upperclassmen.

5. Wisconsin

After 
finishing 
the 
2014-

15 campaign with just four 
wins, Wisconsin coach Mike 
Eaves cleaned house, firing two 
assistant coaches and bringing in 
two new ones, as he looks to lift 
his team out of the Big Ten cellar.

But that won’t be easy, as the 

Badgers 
lost 
goaltender 
Joel 

Rumpel, who ranked third in 
career save percentage in program 
history. Senior goaltender Adam 
Miller will be trusted to fill the 
huge gap between the pipes.

And to add to Wisconsin’s 

misery, four seniors who all 
played significant minutes are 
gone, as well as the third-leading 
scorer from last season, Morgan 
Zulinick, and defenseman Jack 
Dougherty, who left for the NHL.

On the bright side, Grant Besse, 

the Badgers’ leading scorer from 
last season, will return. But he 
will need help, and a lot of it.

The Badgers’ schedule doesn’t 

do them any favors either, as they 
will have matchups against No. 
1 North Dakota, No. 4 Boston 
College, No. 5 Denver and No. 6 
Boston University before opening 
up a grueling Big Ten schedule at 
Yost Ice Arena against Michigan.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Minnesota won the Big Ten Hockey Tournament last year and will be Michigan’s toughest competition in the conference again this season.

‘D’ improved, forwards replacing stars

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan hockey team 

is sick and tired of hearing the 
prevailing storyline.

On the back of shaky defense 

and 
inconsistent 
goaltending, 

the 
Wolverines 
have 
missed 

the 
NCAA 
tournament 
for 

three consecutive years after 
previously 
appearing 
in 
22 

straight postseasons. The 2015-
16 season kicks off with a strong 
core of returning players, a few 
new and improved pieces and 
lingering unknowns. Even after 
major 
departures 
like 
Dylan 

Larkin, who is now racking up 
points for the Red Wings, it is 
apparent 
that 
Michigan 
has 

shored up significant deficiencies.

The Daily breaks down the 

Wolverines’ 2015-2016 roster:

GOALIES

A question mark that remains 

more or less unchanged from 
last season is the situation in net. 
Senior Steve Racine and junior 
Zach Nagelvoort split time last 
season, each experiencing major 
slumps. The Wolverines chose 
to address that concern over 
the offseason with conditioning 
conducted by a new goalie coach, 
former Michigan goaltender and 
NHL journeyman Steve Shields.

Nagelvoort has looked like the 

strongest candidate early in the 
preseason, but Berenson made it 
clear that no goalie has won the 
starting job yet. With decent size 
and good quickness, Nagelvoort 
has been a consistent performer 
throughout 
his 
career. 
The 

Michigan native posted a .920 
save percentage through his first 
two seasons and was drafted by 
Edmonton in 2014.

Nagelvoort outshines his peers 

on Michigan’s roster when he 
plays at the top of the crease and 
challenges shots. Though a bit 
slower than Racine, his steady 
performances 
may 
win 
him 

the permanent starting job this 
season.

Racine, though slimmer than 

Nagelvoort, has great size and 
speed. 6-foot-3 and surprisingly 
quick jumping out of his butterfly, 
Racine is more likely to deliver 
dazzling saves, but at the cost of 
consistency. Racine mishandles 
the puck and kicks out long 
rebounds more frequently than 

Nagelvoort does.

Hailing from New York, Racine 

has produced three solid years at 
Michigan. In 58 games, he has a 
.905 save percentage and a 2.81 
goals-against average.

Freshman Chad Catt is the 

new addition to the netminders 
this season, but he doesn’t look 
likely to see action any time soon. 
At 5-foot-10, Catt is quite a bit 
undersized, especially compared 
to the two goalies ahead of him. 
More 
importantly, 
he 
hasn’t 

quite settled into the speed of 
the college game, fumbling pucks 
that he should direct with much 
more ease. Catt will improve as 
the season continues, but for now 
he remains solidly in third on the 
depth chart.

FORWARDS

Some of the most exciting 

additions have come at forward, 
where a trio of freshmen looks 
ready to step into large roles 
alongside elite returners. The 
Wolverines were saddled with 
the task of replacing Larkin 
this offseason — the Big Ten 
Freshman of the Year netted 15 
goals and 32 assists in 2014 — 
but countered with another top 
talent in freshman Kyle Connor. A 
veteran top two lines should also 
help Michigan establish a strong 
tone early in games.

The top line is built to do one 

thing this season: score, score, 
score.

Justin Selman and Boo Nieves 

are both seniors playing alongside 
Kyle 
Connor, 
and 
the 
puck 

movement couldn’t be prettier. 
These three find each other along 
the sideboards, behind the net, 
or at the top of the circles with 
ease. Nieves called it a possession 
line, and it will be surprising 
whenever the top line turns the 
puck over this season.

Connor does have work to 

do, 
though. 
The 
19-year-old 

freshman can look lost on the 
penalty kill and is a bit light. He’s 
listed, generously, at 175 pounds. 
Still, his handle on the puck is 
unbelievable, and he has a special 
ability to create space, even in 
tight situations. Connor could 
be a leading scorer on this team 
if everything clicks seamlessly, 
but it is more realistic to expect 
some jitters as he adjusts to the 
physicality of Division I hockey.

Selman 
had 
11 
goals 
last 

season, while Nieves notched 21 
assists. Both will look to improve 
on those numbers on this high-
octane line. Nieves will also have 
to carry the physicality. Tall with 
a good build, he should be up 
to the task, but he won’t get too 
much help from either wing.

The second line features Alex 

Kile, JT Compher and Tyler 
Motte. This is the crew that no 
opponent wants to line up against 
early in the first period.

Brash, physical playing styles 

contrast this line with the one 
centered by Nieves, though they 
still should score at a good clip. 
Each of the three juniors has 
tallied over 15 goals at Michigan, 
and captain JT Compher has 55 
career points.

Berenson 
commented 
that 

this line needs to play “the right 
way” — that is, mistake-free and 
charging hard into the corners. 
The Wolverines’ tone and pace of 
play will come from this line and 
from the captain.

There is a lot of youth on the 

third line of Brendan Warren, 
Cooper 
Marody 
and 
Tony 

Calderone — the oldest players are 
sophomores — but also the most 
upside. 
Berenson 
commented 

that this line could be better than 
a third line as the season goes on.

That potential has a lot to do 

with the production that Brendan 
Warren has been able to generate 
early this season. The 18-year-
old played for the U.S. National 
Talent Development Team in 
Ann Arbor and was drafted in 
the third round by the Phoenix 
Coyotes. 
Where 
he 
stands 

out from his linemates, and 
potentially even Connor, is in his 
ability to sniff out pucks around 
the net. Warren charges hard 
after rebounds, displaying great 
vision and strength on the puck 
uncommon for a freshman.

Cooper Marody, a freshman, is 

also an NHL draft pick, selected 
in the sixth round by Philadelphia. 
Marody is smaller than Warren, 
but it doesn’t appear to hamper 
his playing style. The Michigan 
native played in the USHL last 
year.

Sophomore Tony Calderone is 

also a Michigan-born talent. In 
28 games last season, Calderone 
didn’t 
contribute 
too 
much, 

recording three goals and nine 
assists. Those totals should jump 
up this year, playing alongside 
Marody and Warren.

DEFENSE

The 
improvements 
to 

Michigan’s 
roster 
start 
on 

defense, 
where 
perhaps 
the 

most notable offseason victory 
is the return of sophomore Zach 
Werenski. It was thought to be a 
forgone conclusion that Werenski 
would jump to the NHL after 
being drafted eighth overall by 
Columbus. The defensive unit as 
a whole is starting to gel early in 
the season. Quick to the puck and 
with more than a few players who 
like to throw the body around, 
this is certainly the biggest step 
Michigan has taken since the 
2014-15 campaign.

Werenski is far and away 

the most talented player on 
Michigan’s defensive unit, and 
the likely pairing with junior 
Michael Downing will be a rock-
solid unit.

Werenski and Downing should 

clear the puck fast, finding 
fellow Wolverines down ice and 
facilitating offense. The most 
complete unit by some distance, 
this pairing makes it easy for 
Werenski to move fluidly in 
the offensive zone as well. The 
smooth-skating 
18-year-old 

has a slick shot and awareness 
with the puck. Getting him to 
contribute on offense as well 
as defense will be a key to the 
Wolverines’ success this season, 
and it’s working so far. In the 
exhibition opener, Werenski had 
two goals.

Freshman 
Nicholas 
Boka 

played for the NTDP team last 
year with Warren and came to 
Michigan in Division-I shape. 
The Michigan native is a burly 
6-foot-1, 200 pounds and a 
much-needed 
addition 
to 
a 

defensive unit that struggled 
with fundamentals last season. 
Boka has also showed a penchant 
for offensive contribution, flying 
by defenders when he gets a full 
head of steam.

The pairing with sophomore 

Cutler Martin for the exhibition 
opener 
worked 
fairly 
well. 

Martin, who tallied 15 points 
on defense last year, looked 
comfortable playing alongside 
the very physical Boka. There 
were some miscues throughout 
the exhibition game and practice, 
but 
both 
these 
players 
are 

consistently good at clearing the 
zone and making appropriate 
decisions.
