Republican Gov. Rick Snyder speaks about his transition from business to politics at Blau Auditorium at the Ross School of Business Monday.
Snyder appeals to students

Govenor encourages
graduates to stay in
Michigan and help
rebuild economy
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
After kicking off his re-
election campaign with an
unconventional ad during the
Super Bowl last Sunday, the
nerd returned to the University
Monday night.
Over 300 students filled the
Blau Auditorium at the Ross

School of Business as Gov. Rick
Snyder (R) - who holds a BGS,
MBA and JD from the Univer-
sity - addressed his transition
from the private to the public
sector. Before becoming gover-
nor, Snyder served as the chair-
man of the board of Gateway,
Inc. from 2005 to 2007 and
founded two venture capital
firms based inAnn Arbor.
Snyder's speech was part
of Ross' 100/100 Initiative, a
series of events for graduating
BBA and MBA students in the
100 days leading up to gradu-
ation. However, the event was
not just limited to the Business
School as students from across

campus attended the gover-
nor's speech.
During the hour-long event,
Snyder touted his record in
office, particularly the trans-
formation of Michigan's $1.5
billion budget deficit into a
billion-dollar surplus. He also
emphasized Michigan's, and
specifically Detroit's, potential
for future job creation and a
high standard of living.
"It's one of the coolest places
in the country," Snyder said of
Detroit. "I've told people, if you
want to be another yuppie, go
to Chicago. If you want to make
a difference, move to Detroit."
During his speech, Sny-

der also discussed other top-
ics including his career path,
renewable energy and entre-
preneurship. However, he
returned multiple times to
addressing the need for gradu-
ates to stay in the state and help
with Detroit's revival, which he
said is already well under way.
The governor said many stu-
dents aren't aware of the high-
paying career options that are
already available in Detroit.
He also emphasized that while
reviving the city would be a
challenge, University graduates
would be essential to rebuild-
ing and recreatingthe city from

Ridership averaged
around 320 per day
during trial period
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
At the beginning of the Winter
2014 semester, Central Student
Government and the Interfraterni-
ty Council unveiled their late-night
bus route, the Night Owl. The pilot
program fulfilled what Business
senior Michael Proppe, CSG presi-
dent, called his "most difficult-to-
achieve campaign promise."
A month after the system's
launch, the Night Owl has been
met with positive student feed-
back, Proppe said. Running Thurs-
day through Saturday from 10 p.m.
to 3 a.m. each night, the Night Owl
buses have amassed 320 riders per
night on average, accordingto data
from the University's Parking and
Transportation Services, which
have been contracted to run the
service.
The Night Owl bus route cur-
rently employs two Blue Buses,
making stops at popular off-cam-
pus locations, as well as Oxford
Residence Hall, East University

Avenue and the Thompson street
area. There are also transfers for
North Campus and the Central
Campus Transit Center.
Proppe said his goal is to even-
tually have 500 riders per night,
addingthat this cutoff would make
a good return on CSG's investment.
CSG and the IFC each spent
$15,000 to start the Night Owl bus
program, which covers the service
fees for the Winter 2014 semester.
The CSG assembly contributed an
additional $10,000 to cover adver-
tising and other incidental costs.
The system came as a response
to a perceived increase in crime
near campus. In a January press
release, CSG officials said 84 per-
cent of University crime alerts
occurred late at night, with 67
percent of them happening off-
campus.
"People feel safer now when
they're not on campus," said LSA
sophomore Michael Fakhoury,
CSG chair of off-campus trans-
portation and safety. "They have
a safe ride to get home. It's free,
it's accessible and they're able to
maneuver easily."
Fakhoury said the current
rider rate is good but has room for
improvement.
Now, CSG is reaching out to off-

Parties begin to

CLAY CREATIONS

Make Michigan and
forUM have named
their candidates for
top leadership
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
Asking students to join its
members in the "movement to
'Make Michigan,"' campus' new-
est party plans to enter the race
for Central Student Government
president and vice president.
Public Policy junior Bobby
Dishell, CSG vice president, and
LSA sophomore Meagan Shokar,
speaker of the CSG assembly,
will represent the new Make
Michigan movement, running
for president and vice president,
respectively. The Make Michi-
gan party hopes to focus their
party on providing for students
rather than on politics.
LSA junior Emily Lustig and
LSA senior Andrew Craft, the
chairs of Make Michigan, said
Make Michigan is not a party;
rather, it is a movement that will
focus on concrete, achievable
goals including health and safety
on campus.
While it is uncommon for two
high-ranking CSG members to
run on the same ticket, Dishell
and Shokar will square off
against Public Policy junior Carly
Manes, the only other declared
candidate in the race.

Manes is an LSA representa-
tive in the CSG assembly and was
nominated Sunday as forUM's
presidential candidate. Outside
of student government, Manes
founded Students for Choice her
freshman year. The organization
advocates for reproductive rights
and has roughly 32 active mem-
bers.
forUM has not yet announced
its vice presidential candidate.
After two consecutive years of
elections marredby hearings and
lengthy court battles, Lustig and
Craft said maintaining a positive
election focused on the issues is
paramount.
"The political garbage that's
been happening ... it takes away
from the goal," Lustig said.
forUM won a plurality of
CSG's Assembly seats in last
year's election and initially
won the presidential vote, but
forUM's executive candidates
were disqualified for influencing
students while voting.
LSA senior Chris Osborn ran
for president on the forUM tick-
et in 2013, winning the popular
election. However, he was later
disqualified from the election
after reviews by the University
Election Commission found him
in violation of the election code.
During the April 2013 Central
Student Judiciary hearing on the
matter, Rackham student Chris
Stevens-CSJ chief justice-told
the Daily it "sickened" him for
elections to be decided by court

Entrepreneurialism could

New understanding
of protein behavior
gives clues for
eventual vaccine
ByANASTASSIOS
ADAMOPOULOS
Daily StaffReporter
In a recently published
study, researchers from the
University and Purdue Univer-
sity reported new findings that
could help better understand
and treat of a pair of deadly
mosquito-born diseases: West
Nile fever and Dengue fever.

The report was the first to out-
line the structure of the NS1
protein responsible for helping
the viruses spread.
The research was led by Bio-
logical Chemistry Prof. Janet
Smith and Richard Kuhn,
director of the Bindley Biosci-
ence Center at Purdue Univer-
sity.
"We've had it in our sights
for about 10 years," Smith said.
"We've been working pretty
intensively on it, I would say,
for five or six years."
West Nile fever, which
was first introduced to North
America in 1999, and has since
been found in each of the lower
48 states. In 2013, there were

36 reported cases of the dis-
ease in Michigan, resulting in
two deaths, according to the
Centers for Disease Control.
More than 400 million peo-
ple worldwide are infected by
Dengue fever annually, with
seven reported cases in Michi-
gan in 2013, according to the
CDC and the U.S. Geological
Survey. The disease affects
most of the countries in the
equatorial beltand has reached
the southern United States.
Both West Nile and Den-
gue fever are transmitted to
humans via infected mosqui-
toes and can result in high
fever, muscle pain, headaches

Prof. talks disabilities in literature

Tobin Siebers is the V. L. Par-
rington Collegiate Professor of
Literary and Cultural Criticism
and a professor of English, as well
as a professor in the School ofArt
a Design. He is a literary theo-
rist who has, for the last 15 years,
focused on disability studies in lit-
erature. Among many essays and
pieces of nonfiction, he is also the
author of "Among Men." Siebers'
work includes over 10 published
books examining aesthetics and
the body.
What's your favorite class?
My favorite class to teach is
actually the one I'm doing right
now. It's called "Reading Dis-

ability in the Literature and the
Arts". One of the reasons I really
enjoy it is that the questions I find
myself posing in the class don't
have any official answers because
no one has been asking the kinds
of questions about how disability
appears in these different fields;
These are very young questions
in the field.
Whatpiece of your scholar-
ship are you most proud of?
I'd have to say the thing I'm
most proud of is a work of creative
nonfiction that I did a number of
years ago called "Among Men."
And it is my attempt to write as
beautifully as I know how. I feel

that I have had some success at
accomplishing that goal, and that
is anarea that I have great pride
in.
Why is criticism (literary or
otherwise) important?
I think that any kind of
criticism in the University is
important because it asks us to
challenge things as they are. If
you're asking specifically about
lit criticism: if literature is impor-
tant to study ... then criticism is
important because criticism is
the only way we can challenge
how we read books.

Explosion at ball bearings
plant leaves fifteen injured

Investigation
underway after fire,
HAZMAT respond
PETERBOROUGH, N.H. (AP)
- An explosion rocked a small-
town ball bearings plant on
Monday, shaking walls, shatter-
ing windows and sending at least
15 people to the hospital, but
a company spokeswoman said
none of their injuries appeared
to be life-threatening.
Hazardous-materials teams
responded after Monday after-
noon's explosion at the New
Hampshire Ball Bearings Inc.
plant in Peterborough, but fire-
fighters said there didn't appear
to be any environmental damage.
A plant machine operator,
Paul Clark, said he was outside
in the parking lot on Monday af-
ternoon when he heard the blast.
"I was in my car backing out
when I felt a rumble and heard a
bang," he said. "I looked up, and
snow on the building's roof was

flying into the wind."
The blast blew out windows
on the three-story building's
ground floor, Peterborough Fire
Department spokesman Eric
Bowman said. There was heavy
explosion damage, and the first
arriving firefighters saw a col-
umn of smoke, he said.
The cause of the explosion
was under investigation, but
all indications were that it was
an industrial-related incident,
Bowman said.
First responders will try to
determine the extent of the
damage to the facility, company
spokeswoman Kathy Gerrity
said. It was unknown when the
facility will be back in operation
because it would need to be in-
spected and deened safe first,
she said.
The plant, in the southwest
New Hampshire town that was
the inspiration for Thornton
Wilder's play "Our Town," manu-
factures high-tech parts for the
aerospace industry and employs
700 people. Gerrity said she
wasn't sure how many people

H,--0

were inside when the explosion
happened Monday afternoon
but there are usually about 450
working around that time.
Clark, who operates a machine
used in a rolling procedure, said
his girlfriend, Andrea Painchaud,
was at work in the shipping de-
partnent when the explosion
knocked shelves off the walls
and part of the roof came down
around her. He said she was un-
injured.
"Smoke came pouring out,"
said Clark, who lives in nearby
Pepperell, Mass. "I could hear
somebody screaming."
Bill Brock, owner of the Man-
hattan East Hair Design shop
about a quarter-mile from the
plant, said he heard and felt
something but didn't know what
it was. Then about 30 ambulanc-
es and fire trucks went by.
Gov. Maggie Hassan said the
state emergency operations cen-
ter was open to monitor the situ-
ation and she was "very encour-
aged" to hear that all employees
had been accounted for.
"My thoughts and prayers go
out to those injured in today's
explosion, to their families and
loved ones, and to the entire Pe-
terborough area where NH Ball
Bearings is such an important
member of the community," she
said in a statement.
Police advised drivers to avoid
Route 202 through Peterbor-
ough, which has about 6,400
residents.
Local hospitals were asked to
prepare for patients who may
have been exposed to hazardous
materials. Two of the 15 people
who were treated at Monadnock
Community Hospital later were
flown to other hospitals, spokes-
woman Laura Gingras said, and
the rest were released by Mon-
day night.
Peterborough, besides inspir-
ing "Our Town," a Pulitzer Prize-
winning play first performed in
1938, is home to the MacDowell
Colony, a prestigious retreat for
artists, writers and composers.
Wilder' based the fictional town
of Grover's Corners on Peterbor-
ough, where he often spent his
summers.

Kremlin responds to slights
oxver WXVII Victory, -media

Russia counters
Olympic organizers
while political
tensions escalate
MOSCOW (AP) - The Sochi
Winter Olympics are making Rus-
sians beam with pride. But while
the opening ceremony left out
World War I at the behest of in-
ternational Olympic organizers,
Russia's role in defeating Nazi
Germany is still one of the nation's
proudest moments, as some have
found out the hard way.
Perceived slights to Russian
pride caused an independent tele-
vision station to be forced off the
air and the Moscow correspon-
dent of a U.S. network to be sum-
moned to the Foreign Ministry for
an official reprimand. In the latest
display of Russian displeasure, a
prominent anchor on state televi-
sion insinuated that U.S. Marines
depicted in the war memorial near
Washington looked as if they were
engaged in gay sex.
Here is a look at what caused
Russians to react so strongly and
how the Kremlin responded:
LENINGRAD LEGACY
The independent television sta
tion Dozlsd, or TV Rain, came un-

der attack after asking viewers in
January whether the Soviet Union
should have surrendered Lenin-
grad, now St. Petersburg, to save
the lives of the 1 million people
who died during the nearly 900-
day Nazi siege of the city during
the war. The station quickly pulled
the poll and apologized, but Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin's spokesman
said the station had crossed a "red
line." Russian cable providers lined
up to drop Dozhd from their pack-
ages and prosecutors opened an
investigation.
The poll struck a nerve with
Russians for whom the resistance
in Leningrad exemplified the suf-
fering and heroism of the war. But
the station's owner and editor have
accused the Kremlin of using the
poll to shut down Dozhd because
of its critical reporting. The sta-
tion has provided a platform for
opposition leaders and reported on
allegations of official corruption,
including during Olympic prepara-
tions.
After major cable and satellite
providers dropped Dozhd, its view-
ership has fallen from 17 million
households to 2 million, according
to station owner Nataliya Sindeye-
va. While never able to compete
with the state channels, Dozhd has
been popular with urban middle-
class Russians disturbed by the
corruption and growing authori-

tarianismunder Putin.
AN "UGLY' MONUMENT
U.S. television network CNN
caused a firestorm when it includ-
ed a war monument in Brest, a city
in the former Soviet republic of Be-
larus, in an article on the "world's
ugliest monuments" published last
month. The piece said the Soviet
soldier "emerging from a moun-
tainous block of concrete looks as if
he's about to thump the West into
submission before hurling North
America at the sun." It also noted
that others think the soldier "sim-
ply looks constipated."
On Feb. 6, CNN edited the
story on its website and added a
note apologizing for the offense it
caused in Belarus and Russia.
The following day, the Russian
Foreign Ministry took the unusual
step ofsummoningCNN'sMoscow
correspondent for an official repri-
mand. The journalist was told that
"mocking the memory of Soviet
soldiers who gave their lives for
the victory over fascism cannot be
justified or forgiven," the ministry
said in a statement on its website.
The U.S. network then with-
drew the article entirely.
"CNN apologizes for the un-
intended offense caused by an
article from a contributor that
was intended to be a humorous
look at monumental architecture
worldwide" it said in a statement.

A key Yemeni panel tasked
with devising a new system to
address the local grievances that
have fed the impoverished Ara-

agreed Monday to transform the
country into a state of six regions.
But the system of federal-

six regions rather than two, is
opposed by southerners who feel
dominated by the more populous
north.
The decision comes at the end
of two weeks of talks by delegates
from across the country on a new
political map to end decades of
centralization that fed internal
conflicts in the north and south.
The federalism plan will be
included in the new constitution,

he expected to meet this month
with the envoy. It signals an
apparent protest of upcoming
annual military drills between
Washington and Seoul and an
alleged mobilization of U.S.
nuclear-capable B-52 bombers
during training near the Korean
Peninsula. North Korea calls the
planned drills a rehearsal for
invasion, a claim the allies deny.
Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said
the family is alarmed and sad-
dened that North Korea has
rescinded the invitation. But she
said the family is encouraged by a
growingnumber of people calling
for his freedom - Jackson in par-
ticular. Chung said she and her
mother have met with Jackson
and support his humanitarian
mission to bring Bae home.

cases, both diseases can be deadly.
The NS1 protein described in
the report originates in infected
cells, and is responsible for the
viruses' development. Once it's
in the bloodstream, it can cause
bleeding, and hide the infection
from the immune system.
"What we didn't know before
but we know now is which parts
of the protein are responsible for
helping the virus to get replicat-
ed inside cells and which parts of
the protein are involved in inter-
actions with the immune system
when it gets secreted into the
bloodstream," Smith said.
The structure of the protein
was illuminated through a pro-
cess known as x-ray crystallog-
raphy, which uses x-ray beams
to determine 3-D structure of

The drive to increase the num-
ber of students taking the Night

expand the program and make

year.
During Night Owl's plan-

able to produce enough protein

Kuhn said.
There are currently no known
effective treatments for these
diseases, but the research team
said they are hopeful that their
findings could lead to the devel-
opment of vaccines.
"We are planning a whole

about antivirals and think about
developing vaccine strategies,"
Kuhn said.

Kuhn said he has been in
discussions with companies to
develop vaccines against Dengue

vaccine for Dengue virus is a
complicated process, since there
are four different strains of the
virus. Scientists are still working
to better understand the interac-
tions between these forms of the
disease.

forms of the disease, it seems,
when they've been infected by
more than one of the four types,"
Kuhn said.
In the future, Smith said she
wants to explore if NS1 is related
to this differentiation, which is
an important factor in the cre-
ation of a vaccine that could tar-

that's missing in other urban
areas such as Chicago.
"We need our corporate
community in particular ...
to do a better marketing job,"
Snyder said. "We know how to
make things, so we're poised to
be in the center of a big come-
back, and that's what I've been
tryingto create."
He added that students
would be more inclined to stay
in state if they were aware of
the options for high-skill, high-
paying jobs, particularly in the
auto industry.
Because he is focused on fill-
ing high-paying jobs, he said
he isn't concerned with raising
the minimum wage in the state,
an issue that has drawn popu-
lar support lately, especially
among college students. Of the
many questions raised by stu-
dents on social issues, Snyder
refocused them to ballot-box
issues as opposed to something
he would focus on as governor.
"I appreciate the social
issues, but right now we still

need to stay focused on help-
ing people find jobs," he said. "I
don't want to screw it up."
Snyder ended his speech by
encouraging students to aim
high and "be bold."
Andy Hoffman, a professor
in the Business School and the
School of Natural Resources
and Environment, moderated
the talk. In an interview after
the event, he said the question
of jumping between sectors
was interesting because of the
many opportunities students
have today to develop career
paths that don't fit into tradi-
tional molds.
"He's an intense guy, he's
very business," Hoffman said.
"I think he was probably an
outlier for his day, and I think
students can learn from that."
Business graduate student
Damian Chatman, president of
the Ross Student Government
Association and organizer of
the event, said he thought the
governor had an interesting
perspective to give students on
the intersections of the public
and private sectors.
"I think the governor had
some great words for the stu-
dents going forward," Chatman
said.

Craft explained that Dishell

On top of financial support,
contest winners will receive
access to curricula produced by
the National Science Foundation's
Innovation Corps. The seven-
week program, which is being
offered to undergraduates for the
first time, will provide students
with business skills necessary to
develop and market their innova-
tive ideas.
Several of the projects focus on
areas of medical technology. Such
programs include Safe Sense, a
head impact sensor designed for

a surgical suture simulator and
Savant, a program that could help
doctors better use DNA data to

According to a 2012 report by
Global Entrepreneurship Moni-
tor, a London-based organization
that produces annual internation-
al economic reports, entrepre-
neurial activity in the U.S. is atits
highest point since the beginning
of the survey in 1999.
However, a recently published
five-year study found that the
University Research Corridor -
a research alliance between the
University, Michigan State Uni-
versity and Wayne State Univer-
sity - was not competitive with
other similar university clusters
nationwide when examining the
number of startups each group
was responsible for. The report
indicated that t he University of
Michigan was responsible for 11
of 14 startups in the URC.
Ken Nisbet, associate vice pres-
ident for research at the Univer-
sity's Technology Transfer Office,
said economic factors in Michi-
gan may have contributed more to
the lack of startups than a lack of
innovation.
"When you start a company,
you don't do it in a vacuum,"
Klinke said. "We're connecting

students to local mentors and
venture capitalists and engaging
them in the Michigan entrepre-
neurial ecosystem. The hope is
many will stay due to the roots
they're growing through this pro-
gram."
Last July, University President
Mary Sue Coleman addressed
the need for students to create an
impact on the economic condition
of the state, specifically the revi-
talization of Detroit.
"We all know that there's a
lot of work to do, but right now,
it's more important than ever to
recognize the powerful, youth-
ful energy that we feel has real
momentum in Detroit," Coleman
said.
Detroit revitalization was
also cited as a key component in
the decision to move this year's
MHacks to Detroit, event orga-
nizers said. The event drew about
1,200 students to the city for a
36-hour programming competi-
tion, allowing companies to show-
case technological resurgence
occurring in the city.

Nevada officials refuse to
defend gay marraige ban

Governor, attorney
general say voter-
approved prohibition
isn't viable
CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -
Nevada's attorney general and
governor said Monday that they
won't defend the state's gay mar-
riage ban when it goes before
a federal appeals court, say-
ing that a recent court decision
makes the state's arguments
supporting its constitutional
amendment "no longer defen-
sible."
Attorney General Catherine
Cortez Masto, in a motion filed
with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, said Nevada's legal
arguments defending the vot-
er-approved prohibition aren't
viable after the court's recent
ruling that potential jurors can-
not be removed from a trial dur-
ing jury selection solely because
of sexual orientation.
"After thoughtful review
and analysis, the state has
determined that its arguments
grounded upon equal protection
and due process are no longer
sustainable," Masto said in a
statement.
Nevada's move comes as the
federal government and courts

around the country in recent
months have chipped away at
laws the prohibit marriage and
benefits for same-sex couples.
In a one-month span from
December to January, two fed-
eral judges struck down state
bans on gay marriage for the
same reason, concluding that
they violate the U.S. Constitu-
tion's promise of equal protec-
tion under the law.
Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Repub-
lican seeking re-election this
year, said he agreed with the
Democratic attorney general's
action.
"Based upon the advice of
the attorney general's office and
their interpretation of relevant
case law, ithas become clear that
this case is no longer defensible
in court," Sandoval said in an
email to The Associated Press.
The state's move was hailed
by gay rights advocates and civil
libertarians.
"This is fantastic evidence the
state has recognized that equal-
ity for all people in Nevada and
certainly across the country is
of utmost importance," said Tod
Story, executive director of the
American Civil Liberties Union
of Nevada.
The state's move was an
about-face from January, when
the attorney general's office
filed a lengthy brief supporting

the gay marriage ban that voters
approved in 2002.
Eight same-sex couples,
some married for decades, sued
the state, arguing that the law
is unconstitutional. A federal
judge in Reno upheld the law in
2012, sending it to the appeals
court in San Francisco.
One of the plaintiffs, Caren
Jenkins, said she was delighted
by the development, though it
doesn't mean gay marriages are
imminent in Las Vegas'wedding
chapels.
"This issue is far from
resolved. The constitutional-
ity issue still needs to be dealt
with," Jenkins said. "But it
certainly is something to cel-
ebrate."
Tara Borelli, senior attorney
with Lambda Legal, a gay rights
advocacy group that represent-
ed the couples, said Nevada's
move is "a signal there's no lon-
ger any excuse to defend this
discrimination."
"I think it will send a pow-
erful message to the court that
no Nevada official is willing to
defend the ban any longer," she
said.
Leaders with the Coalition
for the Protection of Marriage, a
conservative group that pushed
for Nevada's gay marriage ban,
did not immediately respond to
messages seeking comment.

State of the City
speech focuses on
lessening income
disparities
NEW YORK (AP) - New
York City Mayor Bill de Blasio
used his first State of the City
address Monday to press gov-
ernment to marshal its power
to battle income inequality, a
liberal call to action that will
be closely watched around
the nation.
By virtue of a campaign
focused on income dispar-
ity and landslide win that
installed him at the helm of
the nation's largest city, de
Blasio has become a lead-
ing spokesman for a growing
movement to narrow the gap
between the haves and have-
nots.
He promises to help by
hiking taxes on the rich to
pay for prekindergarten,
raising the minimum wage
and providing ID cards for
people in the country ille-
gally.
"We're fighting to give
everyone a fair shot," he said
Monday during the speech
at a community college, "so
that city government doesn't
set its priorities by the needs
of those at the very top ...
while ignoring the struggle
of those born under a less
lucky star."
The first Democrat to
deliver the address in more
than 20 years, de Blasio
unveiled a decidedly left-
leaning agenda. His sig-
nature issue, to which he
devoted the climax of his
speech, was to again call for
a tax hike on New Yorkers
making more than $500,000
a year to pay for universal
prekindergarten.
"Many wealthy New York-
ers ... know that a gilded
city isn't the New York they
signed up for, even if they
currently find themselves
doing quite well," de Blasio
said. "Raising taxes on the
rich makes our commitment
to our kids more than just
words."
The plan, welcomed in

the cities' liberal circles, has
run into obstacles. De Bla-
sio can't raise taxes without
approval from state lawmak-
ers, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo
has steadfastly refused to
consider the issue, instead
offering to dedicate existing
money in the state budget to
pay for the program. And on
Monday, even as de Blasio
spoke, State Senate Republi-
can Leader Dean Skelos told
reporters that he would not
allow legislation containing
a tax hike on city residents to
advance.
But prekindergarten is
not the only front on which
de Blasio is pressing state
lawmakers in the capital of
Albany. He revealed in the
speech that he plans to ask
them next week for the power
to raise the minimum wage in
the city.
"We will send a powerful
signal to the people of New
York that we honor work and
that we are committed to
making work pay," he said.
De Blasio, who did not
specify what he wanted the
new minimum to be, joined
a national push to raise
minimum wage levels. Last
month, President Barack
Obama called for the federal
wage to be raised from $7.25
to $10. And Cuomo and law-
makers reached a deal last
year to raise New York's min-
imum wage to $9 by the end
of next year.
De Blasio, who expects
nearly lockstep cooperation
from the Democratic-con-
trolled City Council, also said
he wants to expand existing
living wage legislation and
wanted municipal ID card to
be available to all residents
this year regardless of their
immigration status.
"To all of my fellow New
Yorkers who are undocu-
mented, I say: New York City
is your home too, and we will
not force any of our residents
to live their lives in the shad-
ows," the mayor said.
Previous measures to issue
statewide ID cards have fal-
tered, but other U.S. cities,
including San Francisco and
New Haven, Conn., issue sim-
ilar documentation.

Expand educational excellence
Snyder must encourage schools to adopt the 1B programme
ecently, a Michigan public school district took a drastic turn
with its curriculum when it decided to completely embrace the
International Baccalaureate programme, applying the teaching
style from preschool all the way up to high school. IB is very different from
the traditional education system because it avoids simply memorizing
information to spit out on exams. With an emphasis on languages and
global awareness, as well as problem solving and critical thinking, this
unique educational system seems to successfully prepare students for
college and the real world. The state should provide funding to allow

Engineering for the 'real world'

ong before I came to
Michigan, I knew I was
meant to be an engineer.
This belief
may have come
as much from my
love of science
and math as it did
from the hope
that I would find
a community of
people I belonged
with: people JULIA
who skipped ZARINA
middle school
dances to write
letters to NASA about the technical
similarities between the Mars Rover
and R2-D2. People who can't play
Angry Birds for extended periods of
time because they get angry when
the trajectories of the catapulted
birds don't obey the laws of classical
mechanics. People who love the
challenge of creating, of making
their own mark on the world and
learning to better understand it from
a perspective they identify with.
Somewhere towards the end of
freshman year that all changed. In
high school I had been a straight-A
student, but in college I struggled to
keep up, lost in a sea of people who
all seemed to tirelessly and deftly
juggle classes, clubs and internships.
I was inspired, but I was also vastly
unprepared for the competitiveness,
the workload and most of all, the
culture. t came from a high school
where diversity meant far more than
a brochure cover, and the cost of an
education was a concern as real and
as present as getting admitted to a
university in the first place. Here,
I felt acutely like an impostor - as
though the admissions department
had made some grave administrative
error and I was wasting everyone's
time by believingI could compete, let
alone succeed.
For me, the counter-evidence to
this came not from an Aton an exam
or a compliment from a respected
professor. It came from my own
self-affirmation: the first time I
recognized that my degree was more
than a piece of paper or a measure of
my worth calculated to two decimal
points. It was the moment I looked in
the mirror and saw myself for who I
was - my own culture, gender and
experiences - AND as an engineer,
and felt that these two identities
coexisted agreeably, that being one
did not make me less of the other.
I wanted to make my education

and my title totally my own - I
didn't want or need it handed to
me, prepackaged in someone else's
experiences and expectations.
On a more literal note, this
revelation also came when someone
broke into our kitchen at the
beginning of my sophomore year.
In response to this, my landlord
began installing various locking
mechanisms on the doors in our
house. After arriving at the property
one night to find his 1998 gold Ford
minivan parked with the accuracy
of a homing beacon in the precise
geographical center of our front yard,
I entered my home to discover that I
was the proud owner of a padlock.
Well, not a padlock per se, but a
metal hinge device like one might
find on a trunk that, when properly
installed and paired with an actual
padlock, provides a fairly effective
means of securing valuables.
Unfortunately, said mechanism
was not properly installed, a
statement that was informed
primarily by my engineering
training, but additionally by the
casual observation that he had
bolted the metal hinge to the center
of my door, ensuring that either one
of two options were available to me:
1) Securely padlock the hinge
to itself, allowing for uninhibited
door opening/closing abilities while
having a nice padlock-themed door
decoration, or
2) Construct an elaborate system
of bungee cords and chains that
would span the width of the door
frame and provide me with that
"sociopath lair" image that's so
useful for keeping undesirables out
of your room.
Concerned about these security
measures beingsufficiently effective,
I designed and constructed a Rube-
Goldberg intruder alarm straight
from the deleted scenes of Home
Alone, complete with pulleys and a
haommer that would strike a cookie
sheet, alerting me to the presence of
an unwelcome intruder.What exactly
I would do (beyond immediately
fear-vomiting) at that strike of the
cookie sheet was unclear to me, but
it was unimportant at the time. I
was triumphant. I had successfully
engineered a solution to a real-world
problem. I had used my major, and
though it was in a- way that was
absurd, minor and inconsequential,
it was also in a way that was wholly
my own.
From the mundane to the

revolutionary, real world experience
is critical. In a purely practical
sense, it is a foundation required
by employers in an increasingly
interactive and interdisciplinary
global economy. In a more idealistic
sense, learning to create - to be
unique and meaningful in the world
- is the ultimate objective of an
education, a goal which often gets
abstracted in the pressure to get a
higher test score, a higher GPA and a
better-paying job.
Even at one of the top-ranked
engineering schools in the country,
the standards set by and for our
education system often encourage
narrowly defined guidelines for
success. Beyond that, "real world"
experience as implemented by many
engineering programs is limited in
the scope of what it definesthe real
world to be.
When I wait for the bus inside
North Campus buildings, I scan
the names on the walls of honored
engineers and find no women and
few people of color. When I read the
enrollment statistics, the numbers
reflect only a marginally better
representation. There is little
to indicate that engineering has
embraced and accepted the "real
world" beyond the pictures on the
first pages of a recruiting brochure.
Even in the face of increasing
objections, the College of Engineering
still has no Race and Ethnicity
or language requirements for its
students, as these subjects are not
seen to be essential to an engineering
career. This is simply no longer true.
In a world that is infinitely connected
and multidisciplinary, it is impossible
to ignore elements that influence
our perspectives and experiences
- elements such as gender, culture,
race and background - and it is
detrimental and discrediting to try to.
Engineering is a profession
dedicated to technical and scientific
excellence, and introducing academic
requirements that encourage
students to think in social contexts
will elevate, not detract from these
values. We need to commit to
education beyond equations and
computer code, not only to inspire
and include capable students who
don't fit the traditional mold, but to
set and live up to a higher standard
of real-world-driven, socially
responsible engineering.

more schools to adopt the program.
Oxford Community Schools, a school district
in Oakland County, has been pleased with the
results of switching to IB. Though IB standards
are more rigorous than Common Core State
Standards - the educational curriculum of the
majority of Michigan public schools - Oxford
Superintendent William C. Skilling said the
Commots Core does not prepare students for "a
global world that's changing 24-7." Students are
just as happy withIB, claimingthatthey feel that
they are learning more and having fun doing it.
With a program so unique and radically
different from our current educational
regimen, many teachers, parents and schools
maybe hesitant to switch. Although IB is more
liberal and less structured than a traditional
curriculum, the Common Core system fails to
teach students any of the skills that IB does.
The Common Core curriculum relies focuses
solely on preparation for standardized tests,
often requiring no thought beyond textbook
memorization.
Students' ability to memorize information
is not an effective indicator of their potential
or intelligence. Students who just know how
to do well on multiple choice standardized
tests are not coming into college prepared.
The IB programme is necessary to teach
students useful lifelong skills during their
formative learning years.
The IB programme is divided up into four
parts, each emphasizing different aspects of
development:Starting from age three, childrets
are told to 'take responsibility for their own
learning," with teachers only helping to guide
students toward establishing a firm set of
personal values. As the students mature, they
are encouraged to stay aware of current world
events and undertake projects that help them
develop a skill set. Because the IB programme
COMMON SENSE ACTION| p

serves students from a variety of cultures, each
student is required to take at least two languages
to facilitate teaching others and learning about
all cultures. With most colleges - especially
the University - emphasizing diversity and
employers looking for potential employees
who can communicate with a diverse set of
people, the fostering of these skills seems highly
appropriate. In addition, with an IB diploma
students can more easily study outside of the
United States if they want to.
However, there are some concerns with IB.
Many students won't stay in the same school
district from preschool to high school, and some
feel that it is hard for students who transfer
into an 1B program to catch up with the IB
curriculum. A sudden switch into an lB program
may also create a difficuIt learningcurve for both
teachers and students. In order for Michigan
IB schools to be effective, policies must be put
in place to ease the transition and ensure the
cooperation of all parties.
Fortunately, because the lB programme
focuses on teaching skills rather than facts and
materials, students should be able to adjust. In
addition, the progratn caters to students with
special needs, so any student is able to thrive in
the program.
In the IB programme, students learn skills
that they can use in the real world, and students
who go through this program will improve
their chances of performing better in college.
In addition, the global aspect of this prograto
makes students more desirable for colleges and
employers. Unfortunately, the full IB Diploma
Programme costs about $600 per student. Since
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder is planning on
increasing funding for schools, he needs to set
aside money to help expand the 1B system to
other schools in Michigatn. and employers.

Thne value of an idea

Our chance to effect change

Not everyone believes in the power of
our generation. Millennials have often been
labeled as "selfish," "lazy" and "emotionally
detached." Whether it is because we were the
first generation to grow up with the Internet
or the first generation who maybe relied too
much on our parents, we have created a bad
reputation for ourselves.
When taking a closer look, our generation
is something unique. We 'are a generation
who will face obstacles unlike any other. Will
we receive the same social security benefits
awarded to present-day retirees? Will we be
able to achieve the American Dream though
a hard work ethic like our parents once did?
Will we ever know true privacy or will we
just assume that our conversations are being
monitored by the government? These are
obstacles we will inevitably face. If we choose
to, we can face them together.
Last semester, readers of The Michigan Daily
were introduced to Common Sense Action,
a national bipartisan grassroots movement
created by Millennials and for Millennials.
We have chosen to work together, no matter
our political affiliation, and craft solutions
to the problems facing our generation before
it's too late. We care about a diverse set of
issues including: education, tax reform, social
security, incarceration and energy. We will
not follow the example Congress has set for
us. We refuse to accept partisan gridlock as an
answer for inaction in Washington on the most
pressing policies to our generation's future.
After our University's CSA chapter
researched and crafted policies culminating
in our "Campus Congress," two members of
our team traveled to Washington, D.C. for
the Agenda for Generational Equity Summit
where they debated policies and lobbied
Congress. Students from chapters across
the nation gathered at the Bipartisan Policy
Center to discuss the policies formed on
their respective campuses, including those
formed here at the University of Michigan.
They found ways to make sure that higher
education was a feasible goal for all students,

no matter their socioeconomic background.
They brainstormed ways to ensure that social
security would exist well into the future, that
formerly incarcerated individuals have away to
integrate back into society, and that America's
infrastructure is reliable for our future. These
students, with bright, diverse and politically
oriented minds, together created one concise
policy proposal that holistically represented
Millennials around the nation - the national
Agenda for Generational Equity.
The group of students that gathered at the
AGE Summitin D.C.provedthat20-somethings
can accomplish great things when common
sense solutions are placed as priorities. While
not every policy was framed exactly the way
students here at the University wished them to
be, they represented our interests as students
in the United States and the interests of
Millennials from a broad range of backgrounds.
We are proud to have contributed to such a
thorough and representative piece of work
that will be advocated for across the nation for
years to come.
Now that the AGE policies have been
finalized, CSA will begin its mobilizing
phase: spreading our message to Millennials
and policymakers around the nation, thus
building a national bipartisan movement.
As passionate Wolverines, we are starting
here, on our own campus. We will advocate
our message of generational equity across
campus through a series of actions. We will
work with candidates, empower voters, host
events and draw media attention on our
policy priorities, seeking to change American
politics and return government to an engine
for the people: for Millennials. We aim not
only to involve members of our organization,
but all students of the University as we create
a national network of Millennials - left,
right, center, moderate and independents
who are passionate about common sense,
solutions and action.

Sometimes
this is due to the
fact that their idea itself is brilliant
- but often times it is so because
they're looking for people to work
with them on their idea. These
students, invariably, turn out to be
smart ones who just didn't choose
to code, or to study business. They
need an iOS/Android/Web-devel-
oper/designer and maybe someone
for business development. So they
talk to anyone and everyone who
will listen, and their ideas becomes
well known.
Reggie Brown was a junior study-
ing English at Stanford Univer-
sity in the spring of 2011 when he
approached his friend Evan Spiegel
with an idea - an app that allows
users to send pictures that disappear
within seconds. Spiegel, a product
designer who could code, responded
by saying, "That's a million-dollar
idea," and the two recruited a third
partner, hard-coder Ryan Murphy.
In 2013, Brown filed two lawsuits
against Snapchat. "Ousted" from the
company, Reggie's lawyers claimed
in November 2013, "This is a case of
partners betrayinga fellow partner."
It appears as though a settlement
has still not been reached between
the two parties.
For those who've watched the
"Social Network," or just keep tabs

ever, "The Lego Movie" brilliantly
argues that the ordinary people
can enjoy these products without

oblige anyone to follow the direc-

buy a Lego set.
Though critics will deride it as
an extended commercial, "The

rocket-fueled pace, zany charac-
ters and some of the freshest look-
ing animation since Pixar came
out with its own film about living
toys. Then, it blows the audience
away by extending the creativity
of its own world to the creativity of
our world, delivering a thoroughly
appropriate message for a movie
about the world's greatest build-
ing blocks. Instead of relying on
Batman or Gandalf to save the day,
the task falls to an ordinary, yellow
construction worker.

Back when I first inherited
this column my junior year, I
followed up my inagural arti-
cle with a commentary on the
Russian band Pussy Riot after
two of its,
musicians
had been
convicted
of "hooli-
ganism."
Desperate
to make an
original ELLIOT
opinion on ALPERN,
a controver-
sial issue, I
took on the devil's advocate
to some degree, asking if per-
haps the band members were
entirely blameless. It was
naivete at its finest, and with
recent news of the band cou-
pled with the ongoing Sochi
Olympics, I wanted to revisit
the issue at this tail end of
my tenure as music columnist
for the Daily.
First and foremost: After
being released from prison in
December of last year, both
Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and
Maria Alyokhina were essen-
tially kicked out of the band
this past week. I think the
standard reaction here would
be confusion or frustration.
Why, after gaining so much
traction as advocates against
various types of oppression,
would the other musicians
force out the two band-mem-
hers who represent strongest
their plight against persecu-
tion?
Once again, the issue is
more complex than headlines
would indicate. The decision
seems to have been solidi-
fied, in some part, from a
performance in New York
City on Feb. 5: the Amnesty
International Concert. Both
Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina
took the stage after being
introduced by none other
than Madonna - is anyone
really surprised that the
<em>Amnesty International
Concert</em> would feature
two of the most prominent
human rights activists in the
music world?
Yes - according to the
rest of Pussy Riot, this is the
antithesis of their movement.

North Carolina dumps
coal ash deal with Duke

Following toxic.
waste leak,
agency drops
former settlement
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - North
Carolina's environmental agen-
cy sought late Monday to delay
its own settlement with Duke
Energy a week after a busted
pipe at one of the company's coal
ash dumps spewed enough toxic
sludge into the Dan River to fill
73 Olympic-sized pools.
Lawyers for the state Depart-
ment of Environment and Natu-
ral Resources asked a judge to
disregard their proposed settle-
ment with the nation's largest
electricity provider. Under the
deal, Duke would have paid fines
of $99,111 over groundwater pol-
lution leaking from two coal
dumps like the one that rup-
tured Feb. 2.
The state's letter came one day
after a story by The Associated
Press in which environmental-

ists criticized the arrangement
as a sweetheart deal aimed at
shielding Duke from far more
expensive penalties the $50 bil-
lion company might face under
the federal Clean Water Act. The
settlement would have required
Duke to study how to stop the
contamination, but included no
requirement for the company to
actually clean up its dumps near
Asheville and Charlotte.
"DENR asks this court to hold
in abeyance any further consid-
erationof the proposed consent
order while DENR undertakes
a comprehensive review of all
North Carolina coal ash facili-
ties in view of the recent coal
ash release into the Dan River,"
said the state's letter to Wake
County Superior Court Judge
Paul Ridgeway, a copy of which
was obtained by the AP. "DENR
will advise the court when it
has completed this additional
review of North Carolina coal
ash facilities and the require-
ments of the proposed consent
order."
Drew Elliot, a spokesman for

the state environmental agency,
said late Monday that he had not
yet seen the letter and could not
comment.
Duke Energy spokeswoman
Tammie McGee said it is the
company's policy not to com-
ment on pending litigation.
On the afternoon of Feb. 2, a
security guard patrolling the
grounds of Duke's Dan River
Steam Station discovered that
a pipe running under a 27-acre
toxic waste pond had collapsed.
The company reports that up to
82,000 tons of coal ash mixed
with 27 million gallons of con-
taminated water drained out,
turning the river gray and
cloudy for miles. The accident
ranks as the third-largest such
coal ash spill in the nation's his-
tory.
The public was not told about
the breach until the following
day and initial reports provid-
ed by Duke and DENR did not
make clear the massive scale of
the disaster. It took six days for
the company to finally seal the
pipe.

Pope Benedict's
longtime adviser
pushes message
of continuity
VATICAN CITY (AP) --It was
the quietest of announcements
that had the effect of a thunder-
clap on the Catholic world: A
year ago Tuesday, Pope Bene-
dict XVI said in a voice so soft
that cardinals strained to hear
(and in a Latin not all could eas-
ily follow) that he was becoming
the first pontiff to resign in more
than half a millennium.
on the eve of the anniversary,
Benedict's longtime private sec-
retary credited his boss' stun-
ning decision with opening the
way to the "enormous impact"
Pope Francis is having on the
church and world at large.
Monsignor Georg Gaens-
wein's comments sent out a
message of continuity between
the awkward, bookish Benedict
and his charismatic, super-star
successor, the first Jesuit pope
and the first pontiff from Latin
America. It also may suggest
that Benedict approves of the
dramatic changes that Fran-
cis is bringing about within the
church - even if many seem to
go against the grain of his more

restrained papacy.
"We are all seeing the impact
that Pope Francis is having on
the world, not just the faithful
in the church but in the world -
it's an enormous impact - and
this impact was also facilitated
by Pope Benedict in resigning,"
Gaenswein told Vatican Televi-
sion. "He opened a possibility
that until then wasn't there, and
we can see that Pope Francis has
taken this situation in hand and
we're delighted."
Gaenswein is in the histori-
cally unique situation of serving
two popes: While he remains
Benedict's secretary, lives with
him in his retirement home in
the Vatican gardens and takes
daily walks with him each after-
noon, Gaenswein is also the
head of Pope Francis' house-
hold, arranging his schedule and
appearing regularly with him at
his Wednesday general audienc-
es and other public events.
Gaenswein was by Benedict's
side on that Monday morning,
Feb. 11, 2013 when, during the
course of a routine announce-
ment of new saints on a Vatican
holiday, Benedict announced
that he no longer had the
"strength of mind and body" to
be pope and would retire at the
end of the month.
Francis was elected about a
month later and has dazzled the

world with his simple style, mes-
sage of mercy over moralizing
and a tone of welcoming that has
thrilled progressive Catholics
and troubled conservatives. He
has since been named "Person
of the Year" by Time magazine
and has injected new life into an
institution that was crumbling
following a decade of scandal
over sexual abuse, and more
recently over the theft of Bene-
dict's private papers by his own
butler.
As the anniversary of that
momentous day approached,
Vatican officials have sought
to stress Benedict's generos-
ity, courage and service to
the church in deciding to step
down as they battle to preserve
his legacy amid the increas-
ing temptation to contrast his
often problematic papacy and
reserved personality with his
crowd-pleasing successor.
It's no easy feat when no one
ever made a "Super Pope" wall
painting of Benedict or created
a life-sized chocolate statue of
him - as has been the case with
Francis.
Recently, the Vatican spokes-
man felt the need to defend
Benedict when Rolling Stone
magazine put Francis on the
cover and compared his "gentle
revolution" to the "disastrous
papacy" of his predecessor.

Negotiations include
mention of potential
trade agreement
between the states
NANJING, China (AP) -
Representatives of China and
Taiwan gathered Tuesday in
Nanjing for their highest-level
talks since their split in 1949,
with representatives of the two
governments preparing to meet
despite Beijing's refusal to recog-
nize the self-governing island's
sovereignty.
The choice of Nanjing as the
venue has special resonance
because it was the capital of Chi-
ang Kai-shek's Nationalist gov-
ernment during the war against
Mao Zedong's communists
before the Nationalists were
forced 65 years ago to flee the
mainland for Taiwan. it also is
home to the tomb of the founder
of republican China, Sun Yat-sen,
who is revered in both Beijing
and Taipei.
China is eager to nudge the
self-governing island democracy
toward its eventual goal of reuni-
fication, though the Taiwanese
electorate has been increasingly
cool to the idea. In the meantime,
the two sides have increasingly
boosted their economic and cul-
tural ties, opening investment
opportunities and travel across
the 150-kilometer (100-mile)
Taiwan Strait, an outgrowth of
a couple of decades of talks and
confidence-building measures.
No official agenda has been
released, but Taiwan's lead nego-

in Nanjing meetings

tiator Wang Yu-chi has said he
hopes to discuss setting up of
permanent representative offic-
es on each other's territory and
will push for greater Taiwanese
representation in international
organizations - something Bei-
jing has actively resisted.
Wang, head of Taiwan's
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, is scheduled to meet
with Zhang Zhijun of the Chi-
nese Cabinet's Taiwan Affairs
Office.
Beijing wants to see Taiwan
ratify a trade services agreement
that would allow the sides to
open a wide range of businesses
in each other's territory. While
Beijing reveled in the signing of
the pact more than six months
ago, it remains stuck in Taiwan's
legislature, a reflection of public
fears of being overwhelmed by
their giant neighbor.
Expectations for the meeting
were measured. Richard Bush, a
Taiwan expert at the Brookings
Institution in Washington, D.C.,
said he believe the parties mainly
want to nail down their accom-
plishments thus far.
"My impression is that this
meeting is to consolidate and
ensure gains already achieved
rather than to seek new ones,"
Bush said.
There have been indications
China is eager for movement on
the political front, in addition to
the growing economic ties. "We
cannot hand these problems
down from generation to gen-
eration," Chinese President Xi
Jinping told a Taiwanese envoy
at an international gathering in
Indonesia last year.

Five things we learned: Michigan vs. Purdue

By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
Last Sunday's 65-56 loss to
No. 25 Purdue highlighted the
current issues the Michigan
women's basketball team is
dealing with, and offered
perspective on the probable
future for the team in 2014.
1. Fouls causing problems
for Wolverines.
There's no argument that
forwards Cyesha Goree and
Val Driscoll have played major
roles in Michigan's success
this season. Goree, a 6-foot-
3 junior, nabbed her seventh
double-double this season
against Purdue. Driscoll, a
6-foot-4 senior, has anchored
the Wolverines' defense with
54 blocks. The tallest players
on the roster also have more
experience than most on
Michigan's roster - both had
seen time on the court prior to.
the 2013-14 season.
Each has shown strong
leadership and aggressiveness
this season,but the duo'spositive
impact has been hindered by
personal fouls in a number of
games. Sunday, Goree fouled out
and Driscoll had three heading
into the second half, putting her
under pressure for the last 20
minutes of play.
"Both Cyesha and Val, I
thought, got alittle down by being
in foul trouble," said Michigan
coach * Kim Barnes Arico.
"When we're playing against a
rebounding team like (Purdue)
and we don't have two bigs in the
game, it really affects us."
At this point, the Wolverines
have a seven-player rotation,
meaning that when Driscoll and
Goree are forced to sit out valuable
minutes everygame, Barnes Arico
and her coaching staff have few
options when itcomes to replacing
them. That spells trouble for the
Big Ten Tournament.

Boilermakers the upper hand.
"I thought we started the
game with great energy and great
effort, and we were able to build
that lead," Barnes Arico said.
"They started to push the ball
and score easy buckets on us and
really penetrate to the basket, and
that was something we wanted to
take away,but that's what brought
them back in the game."
The Boilermakers did a great
job of managing their half-
court defense as well and kept
Michigan's top scorers at bay.
Guards Shannon Smith and
Siera Thompson, who both
average just over 14 points per
game, finished with just six and
10, respectively.
5. Lack of focus is weighing
on Michigan.
Barnes Arico has continued
to address the rigorous schedule
her young team has faced and
the amount of pressure it has put
on the Wolverines. While most
of their recent losses have come
down to the wire, they look worn
outinthe lastminutesofthegame,
leading to unnecessary turnovers
and missed assignments on the
defensive end
"We need to be smarter
on the defensive end and not
pick up silly fouls," Driscoll
said. "Everybody on the floor,
everybody on the bench, we all
need to be focused and checked
into what our game plan is."
Goree, Driscoll and Barnes
Arico all say that the team
is dealing with inexperience
rather than fatigue.
"Sometimes, we may have
mental lapses that cause us
to hurt at the end - if it's in
the beginning of the game,
the middle of the game, it still
affects us lateat the end," Goree
said. "I believe that we are in
good shape, and we always work
hard and play hard, so at the end
of the day it comes down to a
mental thing."

Junior forward Cyesha Goree has had a productive season after spending much of last year on the bench, but staying out of fou trouble will be key down the stretch.

2. Determination in
conference play hasn't gone
unnoticed.
Now 6-5 in the Big Ten,
Michigan has fallen to sixth
place in the conference after
losing four of its last six games.
The Wolverines have faced
most of the Big Ten's best in
the last month but have rarely
gone down without putting
up a fight, and they've shown
resilience and growth even
in defeat. They lost to No. 15
LSU by just two points back in
November, and three of their
five conference losses have
been by 11 points or fewer.
"We knew when the Big Ten
schedule got here that it was
going to be extremely difficult,
We knew that we were going
to be challenged," Barnes Arico

said. "But I think we've shown from beyond the arc. Against
to be competitive night in and Purdue, she tied her career high
night out. We had a tough one with three 3-pointers, the fifth
against Nebraska, but I think time she has done so.
that's probably the only game Ristovski has struggled
that wasn't a with her
game, so I'm consistency
really proud of from beyond

"But there are bumps in the
road. You're fighting fatigue,
you're fighting the grind, you're
fighting our schedule - you're
fighting all those things, and
coach is still trying to tell you to
get up 200 extra shots a day."
4. Transitions make all the
difference.
Against Purdue, the
Wolverines started off strong
with a 6-0 run, and they held
a 14-point lead with just over
five minutes left in the first
half. But Michigan started to
slow in transition and allowed
the Boilermakers to get the
defensive rebounds that sparked
offensive bursts. Purdue
ended the half on a 14-2 run
and then had another strong
12-0 run midway through the
second frame that gave the

Nagelvoort's inconsistency
reopens goaltending battle

Michigan coach Erik Bakich has held practices outdoors to teach his Wolverines about how to overcome adversity.
Wolverines build confidence

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
The seats at Ray Fischer
Stadium are blanketed in snow.
The only evidence of a baseball
field are the foul poles and fence
in the near distance.
But in left field, there is a patch
of green. In left field, there are
footprints in the snow. In left
field, there's confidence.
There haven't been spectators
in the stands or pitchers on the
mound, but the Michigan baseball
team has built a resistance to the
cold and learned what it takes to
live up to expectations.
Michigan coach Erik Bakich
has been prepping 'Team 148'
for Friday's opener since the first
day of the school year, facilitating
significant improvements all
around and seeing that the team's
core values fall in line.
Winter classes resumed Jan.
8, but the NCAA start date for
team practice is Jan. 24. Bakich
left it to the players to use the 16
days in between to voluntarily
work out and participate in
small-group activities, telling
them it would build and hit the
ground running on day one of
winter training.
The indoor facilities at
Oosterbaan Field House
don't hinder any of the team's
development, but Bakich would
rather be outdooi. because
nothing truly beats it.

Assuming the temperatures
are above single digits and snow
isn't hammering Ann Arbor,
Bakich wants his players outside
as much as possible. The team
starts by shoveling off the field,
and then the Wolverines run
through their drills.
After the 2013 season, the
natural field - was transformed
into a turf diamond and outfield.
The new surface makes playing
outdoors possible despite the
uncooperative Michigan weather.
Bakich says that there's a
toughness elent that he
wants his players to endure,
something that will shape his
players' character.
Michigan trained before
winter break' as well. The
fall term, Bakich said, was
meant to "get guys out of
their comfort zone and teach
them about being comfortable
being uncomfortable" through
team-building activities, one
of which involved traveling to
other colleges and high schools
to play.
Oosterbaan Field House
doesn't have an indoor
bascball field. Bakich settles
for two outfielders in indoor
scrimmages. But he feels the
Wolverines have made the best
of their situation indoors by
controlling what they can.
Each practice is extremely
f.. p.accd with high energy
baukich's hope is that the games

will feel a bit easier if his
players go through a tough daily
routine. Michigan starts with a
dynamic warm-up, moves on to
a throwing program, works on
individual and team defensive
drills and then steps to the plate
in the batting cages. To finish
practice, the team participates
in a fun competition that offers
a competitive edge without the
high stakes.
Another one of Bakich'sffocuses
is to have each of his players
embrace being a "Michigan maini,"
stressing that the defaing values
of such a model are one of the
most important things this year
for a new team still trying to find
an identity.
"Michigan is an extremely
special place," Bakich said. "Our
No. 1 guiding principle in the
Michigan Athletic Department
is that we demand integrity.
You're a person of integrity
when your actions line up with
your words."
During the first days of
winter training, the Wolverines
struggled to get their bat on
the ball. They hadn't seem live
pitching in Months. But after
weeks of high-intensity traitning,
Bakich notices the confidence his
players have gained at the plate
and beyond.
He notices the improvement
thathas come out of the preseason.
He notice the pt ch of gr.ass

Racine impresses
in 45-minute relief
stint at Penn State
By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
On any other team, Steve
Racine is a starting goaltender.
Last season, the then-
freshinan emerged from a
first half filled with question
marks as the Michigan hockey
team's strongest option in net.
In 25 games during his first-
year campaign, Racine boasted
a 12-6-3 record, leading the
Wolverines to the CCHA
tournament. finals with a .899
save percentage.
His performance during his
team's final games of the season
earned him a spot on the CCHA
All-Tournament Team and
was good enough for Michigan
coach Red Berenson to declare
Racine the starter in September,
prior to the beginning of the
2013-14 season.
. "He's been through a year
of the routine," Berenson said
before the season opener. "Of
school, and hockey and off-ice
training, and he's had the ups
and downs. Fortunately, he
finished on a high."
Then, on Oct. 18 - just three
games into the year - Racine
suffered a groin injury that
forced him off the ice for four
weeks. Up until that point, in
slightly more than eight periods
of play, Racine posted a 2.22
goals-against average and a
.931 save percentage, numbers
that stood out considering
the Wolverines' young and
inexperienced defense.
If sitting out wasn't bad
enough, Racine's replacement
gave his coaches something to
ponder. Freshman goaltender
Zach Nagelvoort was unbeaten
M t w overtime contests
that weekend against New

Hampshire and only improved
in the weeks to come.
Now, nearly four months
later, Racine's October injury
still plagues him. Though it
appeared the 10th-ranked
Wolverines would go with
a two-goalie system in
November, Nagelvoort was
given the nod most often
through the first half. Dressed
in full uniform and mask,
Racine watched the freshman
- who now ranks among the
nation's best netminders -
start seven straight games,
begging the question: had
Nagelvoort solidified himself
as Michigan's starter?
Though Berenson felt no
need to seal the envelope,
Nagelvoort's stellar
performance against then-No.
9 Wisconsin two weeks ago all
but did the answering for him.
But on Saturday at Penn
State, Racine - on in relief
of Nagelvoort, who allowed
three goals in fewer than 14
minutes of play - reminded the
Wolverines why he was their
starting goaltender in October.
Racine stopped 30 of the
31 he shots faced in his first
appearance since Dec. 28.
Though Michigan's dormant
power play couldn't muster a
comeback, the sophomore gave
the Wolverines an opportunity
to come back for the better part
of two periods.
His performance was all
the more impressive given
Michigan's shaky defense and
the pressures that come with
taking the ice in the middle of
a period without ample time to
warm up, especially after six
weeks on the bench.
"It's obviously never how you
want to get in there," Racine
said. "When you're standing
on the bench, it's hard to stay
focused, but it's just something
you have to do. You just have to
be ready whenever."
So, as the Wolverines prepare
for a pair of marquee matchups

against No. 2 Minnesota,
Michigan's coaching staff has
more questions to answer.
"We'll have to wait and see,"
Berenson said. "(Nagelvoort) has
played really well, and then all of
a sudden he had a stinker. That
happens to the best of goalies.
"IlikethewaySteveresponded.
He jumped in, and I still thought
we had a chanceto win thatgame
... but he gave us a chance."
Though it's a small sample
size, Racine boasts a .930 save
percentage and has allowed just
2.64 goals per game. And though
Nagelvoort disappointed against
Penn State, he has proven he can
play against any team.
The coaching staff makes
decisions about goaltenders on
the Thursday before each series,
and Berenson said this week
will be no different. If nothing
else, the door has been opened a
little wider for Racine.
"We're watching how they're
playing, how they're handling
it, and so on," Berenson said.
"But I don't think we're going to
overthink it."
Still, 40 minutes of solid
netminding doesn't fully
characterize a starter. Racine's
numbers may make him a shoo-
in for starting goaltender at
nearly any other program in the
country, but this is Michigan,
a team with two worthy
candidates, and there's only
room for one in net.
NOTES: Michigan will likely
skate without junior forward
Alex Guptill this weekend,
Berenson said Monday. Guptill
left late in the second period
Saturday with an upper-body
injury after being pinned by two
Penn State players and didn't
return for the final frame. ...
Freshman defenseman Kevin
Lohan, who suffered a torn
anterior cruciate ligament on
Nov. 1, won't play this weekend,
but will be evaluated again next
week before the Wolverines host
the Nittany Lions on Feb. 21.

Bring on the Buckeyes: 'M' faces road test

Sophomore forward Nik Stauskas was shut down by Indiana and Iowa, and Michigan's offense struggled as a result.

Wolverines hope to
retain first place in
season's lone game
against Ohio State
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily SportsEditor
Since the start of the 2011-
12 season John Beilein's teams
have lost just 24 times.
It's an impressive mark for
the Michigan
men's basketball Michigan at
coach,
especially Ohio State
considering that Matchup: Ohio
a majority of his State 19-5;
team's games Michigan 17-6
came against Big When:
Ten opponents, Tuesday 9 P.M.
widely Where:Value
considered City Arena
to be the bestT
conference in TV: ESPN
the nation over
that stretch.
But even more impressively,
just two of those losses were
followed by another loss.
So, ifhistoryis anyindication,
the Wolverines should be
riding high . when they enter
Columbus on Tuesday night to
take on an inconsistent Ohio
State squad. The 22nd-ranked
Buckeyes, once the No. 3 team
in the nation before losing
four straight and five of six in
January - including a shocking
home loss to Penn State - have
welcomed in the new month
with an unblemished 3-0 record
in February.
Beginning Feb. 1, Ohio State
knocked off a pair of ranked
foes, Wisconsin and Iowa,
before dismantling Purdue on
Saturday.
The same month, though,
hasn't been as kind to Michigan
(9-2 Big Ten, 17-6 overall).
After the Wolverines' 10-game
win streak was snapped at
Indiana on Feb. 2, Saturday's
loss at Iowa was embarrassingly
uncompetitive. For a team
struggling away from home
this month, Tuesday night
represents Michigan's third
road game in 10 days and its

fifth game in 13 days,
These clusters of games in
such a condensed timeframe
are so troublesome to Beilein
that the coach is addressing the
issue, saying that he'll "continue
to have conversations with
the Big Ten about it." In the
meantime, Beilein is doing his
best to simply readyhis team for
its next opponent.
"We're going to be as ready
as we can be," Beilein said.
"It's very hard to get better
when you're just preparing for
a game."
After the Wolverines were
carved up defensively on
Saturday, especially in their
transition defense, Beilein said
all he truly wants is to have
some time to hold a couple
of fundamentals-oriented
practices rather than focusing
almost exclusively on game
preparations. But he also
acknowledged that after losses
like the one at Iowa, sometimes
getting back on the court
quickly can be a blessing.
"It is a beauty that one of
the good things in basketball
is you play sometimes two or
three times a week. One of
the bad things in basketball
is sometimes you play two or
three times a week," he said.
"You either get over a loss or you
get your momentum going."
Thanks to Michigan State's
loss on Sunday, Michigan will
still hold a share of the Big
Ten's top spot when it takes the
floor against the Buckeyes (6-5,
19-5) in a primetime, nationally
televised spot.
At 71.9 points per game, good
for ninth in the conference, Ohio
State's offense stands in stark
contrast to Iowa's top-ranked
offense that ran circles around
the Wolverine defense. Taking
after its best player, Aaron Craft
- perhaps the best perimeter
defender in the country, but at
times a complete non-factor on
offense - the Buckeyes' defense
is good enough to keep them in
any game, but their offense can
be enough of an eyesore to lose
very winnable contests.
Michigan shouldn't have
to worry about another
opposing player lighting it up

like Michigan State's Garry
Harris, Indiana's Yogi Ferrell
and Iowa's Roy Devyn Marble
have in the past few weeks,
but it's Craft's ability to take
the Wolverine of his choosing
- likely sophomore guard Nik
Stauskas - out of the game that
has Beilein worried.
Stauskas is far and away
Michigan's best offensive
weapon, but in two losses last
week, he was held to just 16
combined points on 4-of-12
shooting as he struggled to fight
out of ball denials.
Stauskas should see a large
dose of Craft, who averages 2.6
steals per game, but Ohio State
can also throw guard Shannon
Scott, who averages 2.0 steals
per game, at the Mississauga,
Ont. native. Together, the duo
form one of the best defensive
backourt pairings in the
country - "as good as I've ever
seen," Beilein said.
On Saturday, Stauskas
showed visible signs of
frustration as a hostile crowd
- aided by his poor shooting
night - compounded into an
afternoon worth forgetting.
It has become apparent
that Michigan's offense goes
as Stauskas does. Learning to
handle that load physically,
but perhaps more importantly,
mentally, will be the key going
forward.
"When you put up the
numbers that Nik's put up this
year ... you've got to be ready
to take the other teams' best
shot," Beilein said. "You have
to be emotionally really strong,
especially on the road where
you are the villain, you are not
being applauded by everybody.
"So staying emotionally
calm through all that is
challenging for everybody. It
was for (former guard Trey
Burke), it will be for Nik - it's
part of the process."
NOTES: Of the Wolverines'
last eight games, five have been
against ranked teams. ... Zak
Irvin is shooting 53.3 percent
from 3-point range over the
past two contests. ... Michigan
split the season series with Ohio
State last year.

LeVert's offensive
role, assignment on
'D' have hampered
his performance
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
If there was one Iowa player
Michigan couldn't afford to lose
sight of, it was senior guard Roy
Devyn Marble.
Marble, the Hawkeyes'
leading scorer, should've been
the focal point of the Wolverine
men's basketball team's defense,
the first one to be picked up in
transition, and perhaps even
shadowed and defended the
way opposing teams have been
forced to treat sophomore guard
Nik Stauskas.
But there he was on Saturday,
time and time again, racing
down the floor in transition
unmarked and open for
uncontested 3-pointers. He
sunk six of them in total, each
in the first half, for 22 first-half
points - more than enough to
suck the life out of Michigan.
Marble - who grew up in
Southfield, Mich., about a half
hour from Ann Arbor - was
held to just four points after
halftime, but the brunt of the
damage was already done
against the team that passed
up on the local product, as
Michigan folded, 85-67.
It was the third consecutive
weekend that the 15th-ranked
Wolverines could do little to
slow an opposing team's leading
scorer; for the second-straight
weekend, it landed Michigan in
the losing column.
Two weeks ago, Michigan
State guard Gary Harris went
off to the tune of 27 points,
though the Wolverines pulled
off an impressive come-from-
behind win in East Lansing.
The following weekend,
Indiana's Yogi Ferrell took his
turn scoring 27 points, shooting

a lights-out 7-for-Sfrom beyond
the arc in Michigan's first Big
Ten loss of the season.
If there was a defensive bright
spot in the stretch, it was the
Wolverines' stifling of Nebraska
guard Terron Petteway, who
averages close to 18 points per
game but was held to just five
points in Michigan's blowout
win last Wednesday.
ButonSaturday,theWolverines
again were unable to contain the
player who was presumably at
the top of their defensive keys
to victory. For sophomore guard
Caris LeVert, Michigan's best
perimeter defender, Marble
represented another player he was
tasked with guarding who didn't
seemto miss.
LeVert, Stauskas and
Michigan coach John Beilein
were each quick to isolate
Marble's performance from the
other two.
"I think on Yogi, we did
a really good job at making
him shoot contested threes,"
Stauskas said on Saturday. "I
think a couple times, we just
missed (Marble) in transition
and he got off to a hot start.
That's what got us today."
Added Beilein: "Someone
said to me, 'It's like Yogi Ferrell
all over again.' No, we had
someone close to Yogi Ferrell.
Somehow, (Marble) just got
open, and we've got to figure out
what happened."
There's certainly something
to be said for the Hawkeyes'
transition offense - "one of the
best teams in the country at it,"
according to Beilein, who then
called his own team's transition
defense "very average."
But Marble's success wasn't
limited solely to the game's
up-and-down tempo. On
multiple half-court possessions,
he was simply given too much
space, or he created it himself
by utilizing the motion offense,
resulting in open threes.
But in both instances, either
in transition or half court sets,
thgre's a4n underlying narrative

that has seemingly emerged:
LeVert's increasing role on
the offensive end is seemingly
detrimental to his defense. In
games against the Spartans,
Hoosiers and Hawkeyes,
LeVert averaged 17 points per
game while attempting 11.7
field goals per game, almost
four more than his average
in the Big Ten prior to the
Michigan State game.
It's clear that LeVert has
become the Wolverines'
secondary option on the
offensive end, and while
Stauskas sputtered for six and
10 points, respectively, against
Iowa and Indiana, LeVert
was thrust into the role of
Michigan's go-to scorer.
But despite a significant
upgrade in the amount of time
spent with the ball in his hands
attacking the rim - against
Iowa, he shot 11 free throws -
he's still tasked with defending
the opposing team's most
dangerous player.
It wouldn't be a stretch
to question whether his
propensity to draw fouls
is taking a toll on his body,
as evidenced his defensive
matchup shooting at surefire
rates in the aforementioned
three games.
His 6-for-12 shooting mark
in Iowa City doesn't stand
out, but considering that after
each of his six misses, he had
to then had to recover and
attempt to mark Marble in
transition - more often than
not, he struggled to find him -
it certainly offers another part
of the story for why his defense
may have slipped.
The soft-spoken LeVert is
never one to make excuses -
"It's pretty frustrating," he
said, before going on to say
that, "They're all great players."
But the numbers make it clear
that going forward, Stauskas'
offense needs to pick up.
Michigan can't beat good
teams by relying on LeVert to
carry it on both ends of the loor.

Sophomore guard Caris LeVert has accepted a larger workload on offense, but that has affected his perforrance on D.
Aaron, master of his Craft

By DANIEL FELDMAN

With a medley of awards
for academic and athletic
achievement, the reigning Big
Ten Tournament MVP returned
for his senior season to win a
national championship.
In October, the Daily sat
down with
Ohio State B I
guard
Aaron Craft
at Big Ten
Media Day
in Chicago
to talk about his last go-round
with Ohio State, his final
battle against Michigan and
the lessons he picked up while
living with roommates. Oh, and
tacos, too.
The Michigan Daily: It feels
like you've been at Ohio State
forever, according to Michigan
fans. This is your last season.
Are you angry it's your last one
against the Wolverines?
Aaron Craft: If anything, I'm
a little upset we don't go to Ann
i

Arbor this year. I was looking
forward to that opportunity. I
have a losing record there, so
I wanted to find a way to even
that up. But we're excited. You
know, we've been here for four
years - we've been here for
the long haul - and we think
the best is ahead of us, so we're
going to make the best of this.
TMD: Two years ago, when
talking about Michigan and
Ohio State, the matchup was-
Trey Burke against Jared
Sullinger, since they grew up
together, and then last year it
evolved into a battle of point
guards between you and Burke.
What do you see it as this year?
AC: I think it's just going to
be a battle. You know, you had
the freshmen last year that were
great (who now) have a year
under their belt. They've been
in the battles - they've gone
to the National Championship
game. They're only going to get
better. (Michigan has) great role
players, which is great for any
team. So I'm excited. I always
love playing in this conference

because you play against great
players - some of the best in
the country - and some of the
best teams, and Michigan is
obviously one of them.
TMD: One point of emphasis
this year for the sophomore
class is bonding together. One
of the things you do with your
roommates is a weekly taco
night. Would you suggest they
try that?
AC: Yeah, whatever they need
to do. I think they do a pretty
good job of hanging out together
and enjoying themselves. I
would recommend spending
some time away from them, too.
You spend a lot of time with the
team inside the gym, and getting
away helps, too.
TMD: Is there a certain type
of taco you like to make - one
that separates itself from all
the rest?
AC: We just get after it. We're
eating them tonight and I'm
excited because I haven't had
them in a while with practice
and things. It's going to be a
good day.
