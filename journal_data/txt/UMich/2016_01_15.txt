State NAACP 

stresses diversity’s 

importance in 

politcal landscape

By EMILY DAVIES

For the Daily

Two hours before the sixth 

Republican 
primary 
debate 

Wednesday, about 60 students 

gathered in Hatcher Graduate 
Library to explore the role of 
race in elections.

The panel came as part of the 

annual U-M Reverend Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. Symposium 
— a platform for students to cel-
ebrate Martin Luther King Jr., 
and through his legacy converse 
about the state of racial justice 
on campus and nationwide.

A panel of five, including Ann 

Arbor mayor Christopher Tay-
lor and Matthew Countryman, 

associate professor of history 
and American culture, led a con-
versation on increasing minor-
ity influence in the political 
arena. The panelists identified 
systematic aspects of America’s 
political system that disadvan-
tage people of color, including 
voter suppression tactics and 
current political rhetoric.

Panelist Wendy Cortes, a 

social work student, touched on 
low voting rates in response to 
a question surrounding a study 

that revealed 75 million mem-
bers of the American electorate 
did not vote in 2014.

“I think the reason that some 

of these peoples are not voting 
is because of voting suppression 
tactics that have historically 
silenced the minority commu-
nity,” Cortes said. “Too many 
candidates are out there speak-
ing to garner votes, to get their 
quotas, to get their numbers 
from minority communities or 

State Street 
location is 

currently under 

construction

By EMILY ROBERTS

Amer’s, a Mediterranean 

deli located on State Street, is 
currently under construction, 
and though the store owner 
assures students the deli’s 
quality will stay the same, 
students might have to get 
cozy to enjoy it.

The deli’s downtown loca-

tion is undergoing construc-
tion which will cut the seating 
area in half. This, according 
to owner Amer Bathish is due 
to “outrageous” rises in rent. 
The restaurant will now only 
occupy half of its former space 
to save on rental costs.

“I have been in this area for 

28 years and the rent has gone 
up every year … from 4,000 

dollars a month to 18,000 dol-
lars a month,” Bathish said. 
“Imagine rent that is 600 dol-
lars a day; that’s why you see 
businesses coming and going 
all the time.”

Amer’s Mediterranean Deli 

is described as “the marriage 
of a coffee house and a qual-
ity delicatessen,” according to 
their website. It was founded 
near the University of Michi-
gan-Flint campus, but moved 
to the University of Michigan-
Ann Arbor campus in 1989.

LSA senior Leslie Schuman, 

who was studying in Amer’s 
Wednesday, said she didn’t 
feel impacted by the change.

“I used to sit in booths. It’s 

a bit more crowded here than 
it used to be but I don’t really 
mind it.”

Schuman said she usually 

just stops in to get food and as 
long the food stays good the 
renovation won’t affect her 
future visits to Amer’s.

“The people here are cool; 

it sucks that they’ve been here

They drop the ball 
in Times Square, 
but in Tahoe they 

drop the bass

By ARIANA ASSAF

Daily Arts Writer

During the week leading up 

to winter break, a crazy thing 
happened: it was warmer in Ann 
Arbor than in my hometown 
of Los Angeles. Angelinos and 
Michiganders alike were awed by 
this odd pattern, eliciting reac-
tions that only something as mun-
dane yet influential as weather 
can. Students wore shorts and 
flip-flops to class while my mom 
pulled out her down jacket — it 
was madness. By the time I got 
back home, things had leveled 
out again. Ann Arbor’s weather 
returned to a standard December 
chill and LA’s weather started to 
feel like itself again. So why did I 
choose to sacrifice part of my sun-
filled winter break for three days 
braving the single digit tempera-
tures of Lake Tahoe?

Because music.
SnowGlobe Music Festival has 

been ringing in Tahoe’s new year 
since 2011 with consistent suc-
cess. Though electronic-heavy — 
think Dillon Francis, Shiba San, 
Alison Wonderland — the lineup 
also included hip hop artists like 
Lil Dicky and SuperDuperKyle; 

organizers 
even 
threw 
Chet 

Faker on the main stage, giving 
day two attendees the chance to 
snuggle their friends and sway to 
his down-tempo tunes. I think it’s 
safe to say both the snuggles and 
the variety were much appreciat-
ed by all. But of course, before day 
two came day one, and before day 
one came an eight-hour car ride 
I was so graciously included in 
thanks to some lovely folks I met 
when The Chainsmokers played 
The Shrine over Thanksgiv-
ing break. Seriously guys, make 
friends with your fellow ravers — 
they are very, very cool.

We arrived in South Lake 

Tahoe a few hours after the gates 
had opened. Apparently, every-
one else was on the same sched-
ule, because the box office line 
to pick up wristbands looked 
long enough to reach the top 
of the nearest ski slope. I even-
tually passed the last secu-
rity checkpoint just as Galantis 
announced the beginning of their 
set with an echoing “I wanna run 
awaaaaaay,” just in case everyone 
still waiting outside didn’t know 
what they were missing. It was 
almost as if SnowGlobe was say-
ing, “Hello Ariana, welcome to 
your best New Year’s ever.”

Stage lights danced along the 

façade of pine trees that created 
a natural boundary for the main 
area, the sight as iconic to this 
environment as Coachella’s ferris 

FESTIVAL REPORT

Dr. Alexander 

Alexis advocates 
for individualized 
dermatological care 

By CHETALI JAIN

Daily Staff Reporter

As part of the U-M Rev-

erend 
Dr. 
Martin 
Luther 

King 
Jr. 
Symposium, 
the 

Dermatology 
Department 

at the University of Michi-
gan Health System hosted 
Dr. Alexander Alexis, who 
discussed the importance of 

recognizing how dermatolog-
ical conditions affect various 
skin colors in different ways, 
Thursday.

Alexis, director of the Skin 

of Color Center at Mount 
Sinai Health Center, spoke to 
doctors and students about 
the United States’ diverse 
population and each patient’s 
unique dermatological needs. 
In his lecture, Alexis dis-
cussed the need to develop 
treatment 
for 
individual 

patients rather than general-
izing the techniques used to 
treat certain skin conditions.

The lecture enumerated 

the various terms that are 
used to differentiate between 
skin colors, including words 
often used like ethnic skin, 
skin of color, melano compe-
tent vs. melano compromised. 
However, Alexis said there 
isn’t one good term for differ-
entiations.

“We don’t have a good 

name because skin of color 
is a misnomer — all skin has 
color,” he said.

Dr. Charles Boyd, a facial 

plastic surgeon who attended 
the event, said because of the 
growing numbers of people 

Developers submit 

two competing 

proposals for city’s 

consideration

By MARLEE BREAKSTONE

Daily Staff Reporter

After 
several 
months 
of 

reviewing proposals and debat-
ing the topic, Ann Arbor city 
staff are urging City Council 
members to vote to begin nego-
tiations for one of two propos-
als over the development of the 
site above the Library Lane 
Parking Structure at their next 
meeting.

The lot in question is rough-

ly 0.8 acres and is located on 
Fifth Avenue in downtown 
Ann Arbor, above the Library 
Lane parking garage. The land, 
which formerly served as a 
parking lot for library visitors, 
currently houses both green-
scaping and 52 parking spaces.

This property has been an 

ongoing question for the city of 
Ann Arbor for several years. In 
2010, the idea of converting the 
empty lot to a hotel was debated 
but ultimately discarded.

Stephen Rapundalo, a former 

Ann Arbor city councilmember 
who served as the chairman of 
the committee pushing for hotel 
construction six years ago, said 
at the time the primary focus 
for their group would be build-
ing proposals that wouldn’t pull 
from city funds.

dime go toward these projects,” 
he said.

Now, in 2016, two projects 

are competing for the space. A 
memo was sent to Interim City 
Administrator Tom Crawford 
on Dec. 3 containing two dis-
tinct proposals from competing 
real estate firms in Chicago for 
the establishment of multi-mil-
lion dollar high-rise develop-
ments in the city-owned library 
lot. 
These 
proposals 
have 

been under consideration for 
months, but until now no direc-
tion has been given as to which 
one will ultimately be chosen.

One proposal, from 

real estate firm Core 
Spaces 
contains 
two 

possible 
schemes. 

Scheme B, a $10 million 
proposal, 
suggests 
a 

building that is 352,496 
square 
feet. 
Scheme 

C proposes a building 
that is slightly smaller 
— 22,524 square feet, 
which costs $3 million 
less. Schemes B and C 
of this proposal have 
purchase prices of $10 
million and $7 million 
respectively.

Alternatively, 
a 
proposal 

from real estate firm CA/
Hughes, calls for a building 
that is 273,334 square feet and 
will come with a purchase price 
of $5.11 million. It proposes an 
updated design by removing 
the majority of the retail on 
the ground floor of the covered 
plaza. It also calls for remov-
ing a staircase but keeping the 
upper level terraces, with addi-
tional added rooftop terraces.

Though the council’s vote 

will ultimately decide which 
proposal is activated, Craw-
ford’s office has consolidated 
information 
from 
relevant 

departments within the city 
and is making a final recom-
mendation that the council sup-
port the Core project.

Discussion as to how to 

develop this lot has been ongo-
ing since the establishment of 
the Library Lane underground 
parking garage, the construc-
tion of which took place from 
2009 to 2012. One thing, how-

ever, is certain: The land will 
likely be a retail development, 
not a park.

According to councilmember 

Zachary Ackerman (D–Ward 1), 
various city departments have 
debated the merits of using 
the land as an urban park, but 
Crawford’s office is encour-
aging City Council to vote in 
support of the construction of 
a high-rise building instead. 
Ackerman 
noted 
that 
Ann 

Arbor already contains over 
2,200 acres of parkland, which 
is difficult and expensive to 
maintain.

He said officials in the Ann 

Arbor Parks Advisory Com-
mission do not recommend 
building a park in this location. 

The damage the land incurred 
during the construction of the 
underground parking garage 
connecting Division and 5th 
streets between William and 
Liberty streets is such that the 
ground is no longer capable 
of sustaining trees, which for 
Ackerman makes the idea of a 
park unrealistic.

“This space was not designed 

with a park in mind,” said Ack-
erman. “To the north are the 
backs of buildings, to the south 
is a pretty solidly walled side of 
the library and to the east and 
west are one-way streets, creat-
ing very little visibility for the 
park.”

Previous 
councilmembers 

have expressed similar sen-
timents, Rapundalo said the 
inclusion of open spaces that 
would serve as public domain 
were shot down in earlier dis-
cussions based on the ultimate 
cost to the city.

“While [the parks] are idyl-

lic, the fact of the matter is that 

they do cost money,” Rapunda-
lo said.

The money required for park 

maintenance would have to 
come from the city, a financial 
burden the council was unwill-
ing to adopt in the past.

The two proposals currently 

in play for the property include 
different 
recommendations 

as to how much land would 
be reserved as common space, 
but both meet the minimum 
requirement set forth by the 
resolution.

Councilmember Kirk West-

phal (D–Ward 2) said the idea 
of utilizing the land entirely as 
a public park would never have 
gotten off the ground.

“The amount of open space 

has been a tug of war 
over 
the 
past 
few 

years,” Westphal said. 
“A park covering the 
full site was never an 
option.”

Ackerman 
said 
he 

sees the proposed plans 
making use of the land 
in an innovative and 
productive way.

“There is the option 

to see retail, commerce, 
hotel and residential all 
interplay at once, acti-
vating the area in a very 
unique way,” Ackerman 

said.

Because the city of Ann 

Arbor currently owns the land 
in question, Ackerman said 
through the influence of other 
city departments, the council 
will be able to utilize the space 
in a way that suits the needs of 
this city.

“We own the land, so there 

is a lot of flexibility about what 
we can do,” Ackerman said.

To reap the most benefits 

from the project, the city is con-
sidering selling the air rights 
to the land above the Library 
Lane Parking Structure, with 
Core serving as the potential 
buyer.

“The vote tally on Tuesday 

might give an indication if there 
is enough support to eventually 
sell the land,” Westphal said.

Half of the sales price of the 

lot would go to a trust fund des-
ignated for affordable housing 
in Ann Arbor. Up to $5 million 
could be placed in this fund,

Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to 
be honored in series of events

Panelists, musicians 

and lecturers to 

celebrate his legacy at 

symposium

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

Though classes will be can-

celed this Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day, campus will be far from 
inactive. The U-M Reverend Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. Sym-
posium, which began Wednes-
day night with activist Alicia 
Garza’s lecture on #BlackLives-
Matter, will be in full swing 
this weekend as panelists, musi-
cians and lecturers take part in 
over 40 events that both com-
memorate Martin Luther King 
Jr.’s legacy and tackle issues 
centered around the theme 
#WhoWillBeNext.

“#WhoWillBeNext 
repre-

sents two questions that arise 

when injustice continues,” the 
Office of Academic Multicul-
tural Initiatives’ theme state-
ment reads. “Who will be next 
to suffer, and likewise, who 
will be next 
to lead and 
carry 
the 

waters of jus-
tice as King 
and 
others 

did 
dur-

ing the civil 
rights era?”

The ques-

tion of look-
ing forward 
is especially 
relevant 
when applied 
to the near-
ing presiden-
tial election, organizers said as 
the symposium’s planning pro-
cess began last February, OAMI 
Associate 
Director 
Lumas 

Helaire said election season and 
national 
conversations 
were 

important factors in deciding 
on a theme.

“As soon as we heard it, we 

knew it would probably be a 
great theme with everything 

going on social-
ly and nation-
ally with issues 
around 
police 

brutality,” 
Helaire said.

Multiple 

panels and dis-
cussions 
are 

centered around 
the 
upcoming 

election,which 
has seen can-
didates 
take 

controver-
sial stances on 
issues of diver-

sity, race and immigration. The 
Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies is hosting 
a panel in conjunction with the 
National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored Peo-
ple on the impact of race and 
ethnicity on voters, featuring 
speakers like Ann Arbor Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor, 
several 

professors and Rackham stu-
dents including activist Austin 
McCoy and some undergradu-
ate students.

DAAS 
Program 
Assistant 

Elizabeth James noted that 
because 
the 
symposium 
is 

before Michigan’s presidential 
primaries, students and attend-
ees have the opportunity to 
build awareness before voting.

“With all the racial tension 

in the country, it’s still impor-
tant that we have some sense of 
solidarity as we all have to live 
under whoever gets elected,” 
James said. 

The symposium, in its 30th 

year, also aims to be a space for 
campus to reflect on Martin 
Luther King Jr.’s legacy and the 
state of social justice at large 
through various lectures. The 
keynote Memorial lecture, tak-
ing place Monday in Hill Audi-
torium, is the traditional focal 
point of the weekend and has

for so long and that the rent 
is getting raised on them but 
that’s sort of the unfortunate 
downfall of being a small busi-
ness,” she said.

Bathish said in his experi-

ence, many students aren’t 
necessarily interested in sit-
ting and eating when they go to 
Amer’s.

“A lot of the students are on 

the go anyway so the reduced 
seating won’t affect them,” 
Bathish said.

LSA senior Stephanie Choi, 

echoed Schuman’s sentiments.

“It definitely got smaller, a 

bit more crowded; it’s a differ-
ent experience from usual.”

Choi added she hopes small 

business 
like 
Amer’s 
stick 

around.

“They’re very unique and 

Ann Arbor-esque,” she said.

Bathish said he wanted to 

assure students nothing was 
cut from the menu, and the 
quality of the food will remain 
the same. He said he’s confi-
dent that these renovations 
won’t affect business.

“My formula has always been 

the same: same quality of food, 
same 
distributors,” 
Bathish 

said. “As long as the overhead 
stays the same, I plan on being 
here for another 28 years.”

Chief Information 
Officer announces 
retirement 

Laura Patterson, the University’s 

chief information officer and 
associate vice president for 
Information and Technology 
Services, announced her retirement 
Thursday after 23 years of working 
at the University. 

In an e-mail to Information 

and Technology Services staff 
members, Patterson wrote, “As 
we complete the implementation 
of NextGen Michigan and work 
begins in earnest on the goals and 
initiatives outlined in the new IT 
strategic plan, I believe it is the 
perfect time to pass the torch to a 
new leader.” 

Patterson’s role consists 

of overseeing the leverage of 
information technology across the 
University’s three campuses and 
health system. Though Patterson 
will not officially step down 
until tihis summer, she will work 
with University President Mark 
Schlissel in the meantime to recruit 
the next CIO.
Cit y of Detroit 
investigates DPS 
buildings

Detroit mayor Mike Duggan 

(D) announced safety inspections 
of all Detroit Public Schools 
buildings Wednesday evening 
in response to complaints from 
teachers and parents about the 
poor state of safety in schools, the 
Detroit Free Press reported. 

Many teachers took part 

in “sickout” protests staged 
earlier this week 
 during which 

mass teacher absences forced 
some schools close for three 
days. Duggan promised both 
legislative reform and concrete 
solutions to reportedly hazardous 
conditions in DPS buildings such 
as extremely cold buildings, mold 
and rampant mice. 

Legislation introduced 

Thursday by Gov. Rick Snyder 
upset many state Democrats who 
called the plan unsatisfactory. 
The bill proposed a nine-person 
interim school board charged 
and hiring a superintendent until 
a new school board is elected 
next November. 

“It doesn’t go far enough to 

address our concerns,” State Rep. 
Brian Banks (D–Detroit) told the 
Detroit Free Press. “This is just 
going to be another form of an 
emergency manager.”
Jesse Jackson 
expected to attend 
Flint water rally 

Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. will 

attend a rally over the Flint water 
crisis taking place this Sunday 
at Heavenly Host Church in 
Flint, MLive reported. Jackson 
has previously condemned the 
state’s handling of the crisis in 
an opinion piece published in the 
Chicago Sun-Times earlier this 
month, writing that Gov. Rick 
Snyder considers Flint residents 
“disposable.”

A recent spike in Legionnaires’ 

disesase in Flint sparked 
national outrage and calls 
from public figures, including 
Michael Moore, Erin Brokovich 
and Tim Gremiel, state House 
Democratic leader, who are 
calling for Snyder’s resignation if 
he knowingly participated in the 
contamination. 
Ithaca College 
president steps 
down after protests

Tom Rochon, president of 

Ithaca College, announced his 
resignation Thursday. Ithaca was 
among the campuses rocked by 
racially charged protests this 
winter, and according to NPR, 
faculty and staff expressed in a 
vote they had no confidence in 
Rochon’s ability to effectively 
manage racial dialogues on 
campus and respond to students 
of color. 

Rochon hired a chief diversity 

officer, but students continued to 
criticze him for failing to foster 
relations with Black students. 
Rochon’s resignation will be 
effective next July.

who identify as having non-
white skin, this area of study 
holds a particular importance.

“I think it’s a very interest-

ing area,” he said. “Being a for-
mer U-M faculty professor, it’s 
an area we don’t often empha-
size among the residents and in 
other training areas. It doesn’t 
get the resources that it should 
and if you look at the demo-
graphics of this country, we 
certainly need to be spending 
more time understanding skin 
of color.”

According to December 2012 

U.S. Census Bureau statistics, 
by the year 2060, approxi-
mately 57 percent of the popu-
lation will describe itself as one 
the non-white ethnic groups. 
Already, there is a majority of 
people globally who have dark-
ly pigmented skin.

Among the most common 

reasons for people with skin 

of color to see a dermatolo-
gist are dyschromias, which 
are disturbances in pigmenta-
tion. Dr. Alexis said how dark-
er pigmentations might make 
a person more susceptible to 
conditions like hyperpigmen-
tation, keloids, alopecia, lupus 
and many others. However, he 
also noted that increased levels 
of melanin among these indi-
viduals, responsible for deter-
mining skin and hair colour, in 
these people actually serve as 
protection against photoaging, 
skin damage done by UV rays, 
and skin cancer in some cases 
because they provide a natural 
UV shield.

LSA freshman Ari Spellman, 

a member of the Undergradu-
ate Research Opportunity Pro-
gram, attended the event in 
hopes of learning more about 
dermatology.

“I have really little experi-

ence with medicine,” Spellman 
said. “I thought it was very 
interesting to hear the basics 
of dermatology and about the 
differences in dermatological 

issues between skin of color 
and skin of lighter pigmenta-
tion.”

These differences between 

ski of color and skin of lighter 
pignentation can also be ampli-
fied by cultural variances in 
skin care, grooming, percep-
tions of beauty and alternative 
medicine practices, according 
to Alexis. He highlighted dif-
fering treatment methods that 
are used to combat various 
skin ailments as examples of 
this, each of which possess the 
potential to benefit a patient 
though some risks and side 
effects could also exist.

Alexis said his mother is his 

inspiration to study dermatol-
ogy and the nuances of treat-
ment based on skin color.

“My mother was probably 

the first Black dermatologist 
in Toronto,” Alexis said. “I 
was inspired by a number of 
prominent African American 
physicians who I had the good 
fortune to meet.”

featured speakers from civil 
rights activist Cesar Chavez 
to last year’s lecturer Marc 
Lamont Hill, a prominent 
activist and journalist. This 
year, Naomi Tutu will take 
the stage to speak about her 
experiences as a race, gen-
der justice and human rights 
activist. Tutu, the daugh-
ter of South African activist 
Bishop Desmond Tutu, has 
dedicated much of her work to 
cultivating inclusion and rais-
ing awareness about gender-
based violence.

OAMI will live streamed 

the memorial lecture publicly 
for the first time this year. A 
number of watch parties are 
being hosted both by student 
groups on campus and by 
alumni as far away as Cincin-
nati and Washington, D.C. 
Helaire said it was important 
to the planning committee to 
open up access to members 
of the Michigan community 
both on and off campus.

“We have a large alumni 

body and we want to be able 
to reach them with the same 
message,” he said. “As much 
as we celebrate the social jus-
tice legacy with the keynote, 
much of what’s talked about 
here on campus is happening 
right now. Wherever you are, 
we want you to think about 
how to dialogue, network and 
act.”

The symposium’s website 

offers a downloadable watch 
party toolkit consisting of 
logistical tips and ideas for 
discussions after the lecture. 
Engineering senior Saumya 
Khurana, community service 
chair for Delta Theta Psi and 
organizer of a watch party 
tye sorority is hosting in the 
Union, said the livestream 
enables 
more 
students 
to 

watch the lecture in a familiar 
setting.

“I think it’s a great idea to 

watch the speech and have 
a space afterwards to talk 
about it,” she said. “I think it’s 
important to watch as a com-
munity because there’s a lot of 

issues going on currently that 
the symposium addresses.”

In addition to lectures and 

panels, the symposium’s pro-
gram also features multiple 
performances and other cre-
ative homages to both Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. and the 
broader topic of social justice. 
Young Jean Lee, a Brooklyn-
based 
experimental 
play-

wright, is putting on a handful 
of her plays in addition to a 
public interview as a part of 
the School of Art and Design’s 
Penny Stamps Speaker Series. 
The Michigan Theater is also 
screening “CHI-RAQ,” Spike 
Lee’s film about race in Chica-
go, and the Burton Memorial 
Tower bells will even chime 
famous works by African-
American composers.

Gena Flynn, director of 

inclusion at the School of 
Music, Theater and Dance 
and coordinator of a showcase 
Sunday, held by SMTD and 
featuring famed saxophonist 
James McBride, emphasized 
the importance of including 
creative expression in the 
symposium.

“What’s new is that we’re 

bringing in an outside guest 
and performer really to add 
an opportunity to reflect on 
how music has been used in 
storytelling, and in particular, 
how (social justice) issues and 
history can be shown through 
music and through the arts,” 
she said.

The symposium’s program 

runs from its start this week 
through February, but Helaire 
said he is determined to make 
its impact last throughout the 
year.

“What I’m trying to move 

us towards is asking how can 
we make this not just some-
thing that happens in January, 
but using it as a springboard 
to address issues our com-
munity has,” he said. “That’s 
where the planning commit-
tee comes in, which is made 
up of various units around 
campus. There are people in 
these units doing work related 
to social justice issues, and 
we want to look at how this 
committee can support those 
issues more intentionally.”

SYMPOSIUM
From Page 2

underrepresented individuals, 
but then are not taking time 
to understand what are their 
plights.”

The panelists also sought 

solutions to strengthen minor-
ity voices in the United States.

Taylor stressed the impor-

tance of voter turnout at every 
election, pointing to the 2010 
Republican takeover of the 
state legislature. He fervently 
suggested 
that 
Americans 

work to bring people of color 
back to the voting booths in 
order to elect candidates who 
will bring minority desires to 
fruition.

“Voting is both a means for 

empowerment and an expres-
sion of empowerment,” Taylor 
said. “To the extent that these 
groups feel and experience a 
lack of power within society, I 
think that relates to a lack of 
confidence in the efficacy of 
the political system. We have 
to work on all fronts to fully 
and completely bring these 
groups into society in a mean-
ingful way.”

Panelists, such as Rack-

ham Ph.D. candidate Austin 
McCoy, also spent chunks of 
time discussing voter disen-
franchisement. Each speaker 
touched on voter ID laws and 
closed 
registration 
booths. 

Public Policy junior Swathi 
Shanmugasundaram, 
CSG 

representative and panelist, 
spoke about modern voter sup-
pression tactics.

“Because 
of 
gerryman-

dering and redlining, we are 
putting all these minority 
populations into such a small, 
densely populated area under 
the guides that they will be 
represented, but they get a 
very small proportion of the 
larger scale of representa-
tives,” 
Shanmugasundaram 

said. “It just doesn’t work out.”

When asked who each pan-

elist believes the next presi-
dent will be, all but Mayor 
Taylor, who answered “Hill-
ary,” pointed to Bernie Sand-
ers or skirted the question. 
Regardless 
of 
candidate 

choice, each panelist pushed 
for students and young people 
to put pressure on all candi-
dates to see and act on the 
fact that, as Prof. Country-
man stated, “this is no longer 
a white nation.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Shavon 

Edwards, who attended the 
event, said she enjoyed the 
discussion.

“I’m happy with the conver-

sation,” Edwards said. “I think 
it is really important that stu-
dents get a viewpoint from 
the mayor. I really think that 
the points the panelists talked 
about are important for stu-
dents to hear.”

Symposium events in honor 

of Martin Luther King Jr. will 
continue throughout January.

depending on which proposal 
is ultimately chosen.

According to Jennifer Hall, 

executive director of the Ann 
Arbor Housing Commission, 
the trust fund plays a vital 
role in funding affordable 
housing initiatives in the city.

“The primary sources of 

revenue for the fund are gen-
eral fund contributions from 
City Council — sales proceeds 
from the sale of city property 
and private developer contri-
butions,” she said.

Hall added that the devel-

opment of this lot is impor-
tant for the development of 
further projects in affordable 
housing in the city, noting 
that the AAHC is in the mid-
dle of redeveloping all 18 pub-
lic housing sites in the city, 
which include 355 apartments 
for affordable housing. $60 
million is needed to complete 
this project.

Ackerman agreed, saying 

that a healthy trust fund is 
needed in order for action to 
be taken in this area. He said 
other than the contribution 
from the Library lot, there are 
no other clear funding mech-
anisms.

I 

grew up in a conserva-
tive town on the other side 
of the state — the type of 

town where you 
can’t 
go 
more 

than a block or 
two 
without 

being able to see 
another church. Beginning at the 
end of elementary school, I was 
inundated with the use of words 
like “fag” and “queer” by my friends 
and 
teammates. 
Without 
fully 

understanding the implications of 
these words, I used them myself 
in making jokes or using them as a 
casual insult, accepting it simply as 
part of the world. As I grew older, 
however, I began to understand the 
context surrounding these words. 
The understanding of what the 
words meant, however, sadly did 
not stop me from using them at that 
point in my life. I deeply regret the 
days I spent using those hateful 
words, and the underlying assump-
tion behind them — that I did not 
accept the people those words were 
used to persecute. While my views 
and behaviors did change, I will 
never be able to change those years. 
Should I be forgiven?

Does change beget forgiveness? 

If one repudiates ideas, evolves 
with the times, should that earn 
your respect (and maybe even your 
vote)? Because politicians live their 
lives in the spotlight, should we 
hold them to a higher standard than 
we hold ourselves?

Now, these thoughts might seem 

to be worth more than your penny, 
and philosophical in nature, but 
they are very important questions 
at the present moment. We are not 
far from the most important politi-
cal event of the next four years: 
our nation’s presidential election, 
which is just under a year away.

In political campaigns (like the 

ones currently underway), candi-
dates often attack each other by 
identifying who their opponent 
used to be in relation to who they 
currently are, selectively choosing 
focus points for their own benefit. 
If one candidate never changes, but 

stays true to their ideals, the oppo-
sition will tout them as resistant to 
change. If they change their thought 
as public opinion shifts and new 
arguments are brought to the table, 
they will be marked as not sticking 
to their morals or being inconsistent.

Hillary Clinton is at the center 

of questions and attacks like this. 
As she is herself a centrist/moder-
ate Democrat, she opens herself 
to attacks from both the left and 
the right. The right attacks her for 
changing her opinions on issues 
such as same-sex marriage and 
criminal justice reform. The left, 
for not changing her opinions ear-
lier.

“I believe marriage is not just a 

bond, but a sacred bond between 
a man and a woman,” she said in 
2004 as a senator who initially 
opposed same-sex marriage. Then 
abruptly in 2013, as potential can-
didates were beginning to increase 
the frequency of their speeches and 
public appearances, she became a 
supporter of same-sex marriage. 
Her timing happened to match up 
exactly with when those in favor 
of same-sex marriage became the 
majority in the nation.

Her views on sentencing laws 

and criminal justice in general 
have also changed over the years, 
and quite radically. Here’s Clinton 
in 1994 when her husband cam-
paigned for the now infamous 
three-strikes law: “We need more 
police, we need more and tougher 
prison sentences for repeat offend-
ers. The three strikes and you’re out 
for violent offenders has to be part 
of the plan. We need more prisons…” 
But in 2013, as other candidates for 
2016 began to let their positions be 
known, her views changed as she 
began to talk about “ending the era 
of mass incarceration.”

All the evidence I’ve presented so 

far points to one conclusion: that she 
is making these points for political 
purposes — that she does not truly 
care, but instead is just saying these 
things to win office. But consider 
my story of change, or one of your 
own. The truth is that we all change. 

Our minds expand as we meet new 
people and learn new things. Some-
times change is abrupt and some-
times change takes time. Sometimes 
it’s small and other times it’s monu-
mental. Humans have understood 
for millennia that the only thing con-
stant in life is change.

And, luckily, even politicians 

change. While I am unsure of 
who I will support in the coming 
election, I can believe that Clin-
ton’s ideas on these subjects have 
changed and that they might have 
taken almost two decades to do so. 
It took me many years to change 
my views on the use of word like 
“fag” and “queer,” and I was not 
raised in her time, nor in her envi-
ronment. And there is some evi-
dence that her positions on both 
issues may have begun to change 
much earlier — for instance, in 
2007 (in the middle of another 
political campaign), when she was 
commenting on criminal justice 
reform, she said, “I want to have a 
thorough review of all of the pen-
alties, of all the kinds of sentenc-
ing, and, more importantly, start 
having more diversion and having 
more second-chance programs.”

But evidence of earlier change 

does not erase the fact that her stanc-
es contributed to irreparable damage 
to the lives of millions of Americans, 
robbing them in turn of time and 
happiness. Her words and support 
helped increase the amount of their 
children’s birthdays parents missed 
in prison, or decreased the amount 
of years two mothers could spend 
together, bound in holy matrimony.

I’ve posed many questions in 

this column, and answered fewer. 
Your impression is all that’s left. 
All I can hope is that my words 
spur you to investigate further, 
that they might encourage you to 
expose yourself to information 
that challenges your views, and 
that you might be open to chang-
ing your own mind once in awhile.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

CONNOR 
KIPPE

I

write this article as I close 
what most consider some of 
the most whirlwind months 

of their lives: the 
first semester of 
college. 
Fresh-

man 
students 

must adjust to liv-
ing in a new envi-
ronment, navigating their newfound 
social freedom and acclimating to 
the difficulty of university-level aca-
demics.

Luckily, I was spared from much 

of the stress that accompanies the 
latter because my high school pre-
pared me for the rigor of college 
coursework and provided me with 
the skills I’d need to be successful 
across various disciplines. Though 
many students at this university 
had high school experiences simi-
lar to my own, I constantly consider 
that there are students here who did 
not have this privilege and whose 
schools did not prepare them for 
college-level education.

This sentiment was reaffirmed on 

the first snowy day of winter. I spent 
that Saturday at the Undergraduate 
Science Building volunteering with 
STEM Society, a student organiza-
tion on campus that aims to expose 
K-12 students, particularly those 
from lower socioeconomic back-
grounds, to inquiry-based science 
and math education. Our guests for 
the day were 50 JROTC students 
from Detroit-area high schools. 
As the students were busy shak-
ing their rock salt ice cream (who 
knew colligative properties could 
be so delicious?), the group’s colo-
nel spoke before them to bring the 
day to a close.

“How many of you found some 

of the content today to be a bit over 
your head?” the colonel asked.

About half of the students raised 

their hands. The question was as fair 
as the students’ response: As col-
lege students engrossed in our fields, 
sometimes we forget the basics were 
once not so simple.

He followed with another ques-

tion: “What do you have to do when 
your teachers don’t teach these 

things in school?”

“Self-educate,” they responded.
“Self-educate” resounded in my 

head. They self-educate not because 
they want to learn more for them-
selves, or because they have found 
their passion in a given subject. They 
self-educate because their teachers 
don’t teach these things in school.

Yes, there is only so much teachers 

can cover in the short period they’re 
given with students each day, and 
yes, students should be responsible 
for learning material on their own 
time outside of class to maximize 
their education. But the notion that 
these students should rely solely on 
self-education upset me deeply.

We live in perhaps the most edu-

cated era of human history, one 
where educational resources are 
more available than ever — a luxury 
that has resulted in an increased 
emphasis on the value of quality 
education. This shows in the efforts 
of presidential hopefuls like Bernie 
Sanders and Hillary Clinton, who 
claim lowering college tuition to be 
a tenet of their political platforms. 
While a college education is (validly) 
seen as a gateway to social mobility, 
perhaps the real problem does not lie 
in the rising costs of college tuition, 
but in the unreliable nature of pub-
lic schools, especially those in low-
income neighborhoods.

Take Detroit Public Schools (DPS), 

for example, the school system to 
which many of the JROTC students 
belong. Results from DPS’s ACT 
scores reveal the lackluster educa-
tion students receive there. In 2014, 
only 17.8 percent of DPS 11th grad-
ers were considered “college-ready”; 
only 28.8 percent and 28.4 percent of 
test takers demonstrated proficiency 
in math and science, respectively. 
Moreover, nearly 200 schools in the 
district did not have a single student 
considered “college-ready” by the 
ACT’s standards, with the average 
score hanging around 16.4.

DPS’s teachers are not entirely 

— if at all — culpable for students’ 
poor performance on the state’s 
standardized tests. According to 
the Detroit Free Press, DPS faces 

an ever-increasing shortage of 
teachers, with merely 2,580 teach-
ers to teach more than 46,000 
students this school year. Teach-
ers’ pay remains stagnant, even 
though the district expects many 
of the teachers to be instruction-
al “coaches” in addition to their 
normal teaching positions. This, 
combined 
with 
the 
uncertain 

future of the district, has made a 
difficult job — teaching — all the 
more difficult. While the teach-
ers in the district are spread too 
thin, the district, pressured to fill 
vacant teaching spots, has pushed 
non-teaching faculty into teach-
ing positions at the expense of the 
quality of students’ education.

This phenomenon is also not con-

fined to Detroit’s city limits. Stud-
ies show a correlation between low 
socioeconomic status and lower 
ACT and SAT scores, and teacher 
shortages plague districts across 
the nation. Such large disparities in 
the quality of education across dis-
tricts make it exceedingly difficult 
for students in underprivileged dis-
tricts to receive the schooling they 
need to make a college education a 
reality for themselves — no matter 
how much they “self-educate.”

As students at a university as 

prestigious as our own, we often 
forget how lucky we are to have 
had the opportunity to get here. 
The “normal” high school experi-
ence for many of us was one that 
provided the education and extra-
curricular opportunities we needed 
to earn admission to, and later be 
successful at, the University. But 
we must remember that there are 
those among us who did not have 
these privileges, a disadvantage no 
sum of scholarship money can truly 
mend. Perhaps this is the biggest 
roadblock to the creation of a more 
diverse campus community: If we 
truly are to achieve the diversity 
we’d like to see on college campus-
es, we must first fix the path stu-
dents take to get there.

Roadblocks to college

REBECCA 

TARNOPOL

S

ome time ago — my fallible memory 
says the summer of 2010 — I noted 
something different about my moth-

er. Alongside the alarm clock 
and hand moisturizer, there 
was a different set of books 
on her nightstand. Not the 
usual Paulo Coelho or India 
Today, but the written works 
of Deepak Chopra, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and 
the like. These tend to be important to those 
seeking something spiritual. At the time, it 
was simply an observation — I didn’t think 
much of it. Maybe a year or so later, I came 
to her because I was really upset at someone 
at school. After pouring out the wrongs and 
grievances done to me, I hoped for her to con-
demn the doings of another. However, curi-
ously, she did the opposite. She asked me, “Do 
you have to be unhappy?”

My memory continues to be unhelpful, 

but it might have been during one of my 
many teenage evenings of anxiety, sitting in 
a poorly lit, silent room when I recollected 
her words. By chance, I was in one of my few 
moments of clarity, so I repeatedly asked 
myself, “Why did I have to be unhappy?” 
Now, it’s been years and those evenings might 
be in the past, but the thought still remains. 
Why did I have to be anything?

I kept thinking about my mother and what 

happened to her. It wasn’t anything outwardly 
apparent, rather something quiet and subtle. I 
could feel it in the way she spoke, the way she 
reacted, the way she gave advice. She no longer 
wanted things, and she refused presents for 
birthdays and Mothers Days. Whenever I com-
plained about something, she told me I didn’t 
have to feel like this. It felt like she blamed 
me for my problems. I didn’t know what was 
going on in her head, so there indeed was some 
unavoidable distance. It felt like she changed 
the way she saw things and the way she felt 
about people; like she almost seemed to live by 
some new truth.

This affected me. Every now and then, she 

would give me some vague-sounding philo-
sophical advice that was supposed to solve 
my problem. It was always about me chang-
ing myself. I always acted like I wasn’t listen-
ing, like I had no time for philosophy. But on 
a few very rare occasions, I heard her. I didn’t 
always understand what she meant, but I cer-
tainly heard. And, in some inexplicable way, 
it seemed to help.

Now, I don’t know why, but I was curi-

ous about how this had happened. I wanted a 
meta-analysis of sorts. I found it interesting 
how thoughts translated into actions, and these 
actions were interpreted into thoughts by oth-
ers. The brilliantly understated manner in 
which these ideas moved utterly fascinated me.

There is a general path by which ideas 

are transmitted from person to person and, 
somewhat virally, from community to com-
munity. Everything said or put forth is an 
idea, sent into a person’s mind. The mind pro-
cesses it and either denies or accepts it. This 
process works similarly in a parent-child 
relationship, but some aspects are some-
what intensified. A young child has two main 
spheres of knowledge to draw from: genetics 
and experience. And at that young age, most 
experiences involve the parents, resulting in 
the child magnifying and studying religiously 
every thought and belief their parent shows 
to them. To a young child, the way a parent 
lives is how all life is generally lived. Their 
parents’ actions are the tenets of their per-
spective, the basis of what is and what isn’t. 

Whether or not they keep these ideas later on 
in life is a different thing, but these are the 
fundamentals. These are what form the laws 
of our newly formed skull-sized kingdoms, as 
a certain Dave Wallace would put it.

An analogy I find useful is comparing this 

effect with migration. A person migrates when 
they desire a better life. That same concept 
applies here, but instead of a physical space, 
it occurs in a mental one. My mother must’ve 
yearned for a better life, enough for her to 
immigrate to a state of thought that clearly 
made her life better, a state of thought I wish 
I understood. 

Going with this migration metaphor, it’s 

interesting to consider how this effect trick-
les down through generations. What happens 
when my children see my adopted tenets as 
their base tenets? We know people are a com-
bination of their genes and their environment. 
We know people with similar genes diverge 
when in different physical environments, but 
I’m curious how a person will act when they’re 
in different mental landscapes, when the very 
core framework of their mind is different. 
Would their baseline happiness be higher? 
Lower? How about general life and relation-
ship satisfaction? Unfortunately, I don’t know 
the answers to these questions. Too many vari-
ables, too personal of a study. Maybe this is one 
of those things everyone knows, but doesn’t 
know for sure. Still, I really wish I did.

Some of you might be wondering why I 

didn’t just ask her. I could’ve just spoken to her 
about what happened, and I’d have spared all 
these mental gymnastics. That is a fair point, 
and so I did exactly that. I got over the some-
what Indian awkwardness that is asking your 
parents about themselves. I sat down beside her 
and asked away. At first, she smiled and told me 
she never thought anyone noticed (I wonder 
how she’ll feel when she finds out I wrote an 
entire column about her). She gazed at the tele-
vision for a bit, paying it no attention. She told 
me she felt mentally trapped. That for what-
ever reason, she felt she had no anchor, that her 
state of being felt eternally tied to her husband, 
her friends, her children, essentially everyone 
other than her. She said she didn’t feel in con-
trol of her life, and she had to fix this somehow. 
Finally, I wondered if she thought this change 
in mindset would have changed the lives of her 
children. She replied no, that if there indeed 
was any effect, it was inadvertent. 

Regardless of events of the transitory period, 

I’m genuinely happy she’s content now. Wheth-
er she knew it or not, it did affect me. I’d like to 
think that, after all this, I’m a bit more under-
standing, a bit more accepting of life and its 
people and its events. While I cannot yet articu-
late all the ways, I do know something for sure: 
that my mother, as usual, was right. She smiled 
when I told her that.

I wish I had some sort of moral to tell you, 

something beautiful and profound that would 
make your life a little better. All I have are my 
own experiences and my own perspective. I 
wager that there is worth in simply being con-
scious of yourself and your actions. There is 
also worth in knowing that, while you don’t 
have control over many things, you do have 
control over yourself, and you have the power to 
do with it what you want. In our own personal 
times of need, we might all have to be migrants. 
My amma was one, and she exists contently. 
Who knows. One day, if we’re all really lucky, 
we might get to live like her.

‘Angel from Hell’ is 
no divine comedy

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

If it weren’t for its supernatu-

ral hook, “Angel from Hell” might 
have been just another bland, 
“opposites 
attract” comedy 
used to fill up an 
empty time slot 
on CBS’s lineup. 
But because the 
show 
features 

the incompara-
ble Jane Lynch 
(“Glee”) as its 
driving 
force, 

that should be 
enough to make 
“Angel 
from 

Hell” worth the watch. 

Lynch 
plays 
the 
show’s 

eponymous 
protagonist, 
an 

eccentric, high-functioning alco-
holic named Amy, who seeks to 
guide Allison (Maggie Lawson, 
“Psych”), an uptight, perpetually 
distressed dermatologist in Bev-
erly Hills. Their first encounter 
is purely accidental, or so it may 
seem: Amy bumps into Allison 
and her unemployed boyfriend 
Evan 
(David 
Denman, 
“The 

Gift”) at a farmer’s market, then 
again in a coffee shop with Alli-
son’s childish brother Brad (Kyle 
Bornheimer, “The D Train”). 
The 
coincidences 
eventually 

confuse Allison, which leads to 
Amy revealing herself as Alli-
son’s guardian angel. Similar to 
Lynch’s previous TV role as the 

skillfully sarcastic Sue Sylves-
ter on “Glee,” Amy comes with 
a dark sense of humor, but she 
still manages to be likeable. She’s 
there to help and defend Allison, 
not to ruin her life, even if she 
tends to be a little overbearing 
and intrusive. 

Amy comes at a moment in 

Allison’s life that will lead her 
down a dangerous path. She 
tells the blithely unaware Alli-
son that Evan is sleeping with 
her best friend Jill (Liza Lapira, 
“Battle Creek”). At first, Alli-
son catches them eating dinner 
together, but learns that they 
were planning a montage for 
her and Evan’s housewarming 
party to celebrate all of Allison’s 
“big moments.” It seems like an 
honest mistake, until come time 
for the party Allison finds Jill’s 
clover charm in Evan’s office, 
leading to Jill’s admitting to her 
affair with Evan.

Most, if not all the characters 

in “Angel from Hell” have certain 
clichéd traits, and the stilted act-
ing doesn’t help either. Though 
Lawson does show some poten-
tial, her portrayal of Allison isn’t 
captivating enough to ignore how 
trite her character is. Comedian 
Kevin Pollack (“Mom”), who usu-
ally succeeds in both comedic 
and dramatic roles, is underused 
as Allison’s father Marv. Fortu-
nately, Lynch performs admirably 
in an offbeat performance that 
keeps “Angel from Hell” from 
going off the rails. The writing 

in the pilot episode isn’t terrible, 
but it isn’t off-the-walls fantas-
tic either. In fact, many of the 
jokes in the show’s pilot episode 
are very plain, dry and unfunny, 
except when they come out of 
Lynch’s mouth. Her naturally 
snarky delivery and charismatic 
appeal make the most cringewor-
thy scenes seem enjoyable and the 
more sentimental moments seem 
genuinely poignant.

One of the most enchanting 

moments in “Angel From Hell”’s 
pilot episode actually comes at the 
very end. Scrolling through the 
montage of “big moments” Evan 
and Jill made, Allison notices 
Amy in the background of one 
particular childhood photo. As 
Allison becomes fascinated and 
perplexed, the scene fades to the 
montage’s background song: Band 
of Horses’s excellent “The Funer-
al.” While the scene is rather short 
and not necessarily crucial, it still 
provides some gravitas for an oth-
erwise mediocre first episode.

Though “Angel from Hell” will 

probably continue to use Lynch 
as the source of comedy and 
drama, she shouldn’t be the only 
one carrying the show’s weight. 
The lackluster jokes, unfocused 
plot and weak premise have yet to 
unravel into something absorb-
ing. Unless Lynch can somehow 
single-handedly 
save 
“Angel 

from Hell” from going off the 
deep end, the show is destined to 
remain a half-hour of uninterest-
ing, dull gags.

TV REVIEW
J-Lo’s complex ‘Blue’

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

From the get-go, it’s clear 

that NBC’s new series “Shades 
of Blue” isn’t another cookie-
cutter 
crime 

drama. 
Jen-

nifer 
Lopez 

(“The 
Boy 

Next 
Door”), 

and her new 
choppy 
bob, 

plays 
Harlee 

Santos, 
the 

no-nonsense 
cop operating 
in a morally 
ambiguous 
Brooklyn pre-
cinct. The thrilling series pre-
miere introduces Santos and 
her team of tight-knit cops who 
play by their own rules. Lt. Matt 
Wozniak (Ray Liotta, “Good-
fellas”) and his band of corrupt 
officers break the mold of the 
traditional crime drama narra-
tive by walking the thin line of 
moral conduct to benefit them-
selves while maintaining a tight 
grip over their neighborhood’s 
inept criminals.

In 
this 
fresh, 
fast-paced 

crime thriller, Lopez adeptly 
plays both the emotionally vul-
nerable single mother and the 
tough cop. Santos struggles to 
judge whether the ends are jus-
tified by her and her task force’s 
unconventional means. Though 
Lopez stands out as the star of 
the series, it’s about her rela-
tionship with her colleagues 
and the impenetrability of their 
ties to one another just as much 

as it is about her grapple with 
morality and providing for her 
daughter. She isn’t just a resil-
ient policewoman committed to 
her job. She’s a tenacious crime 
fighter whose loyalty to her team 
binds her and her daughter Cris-
tina (Sarah Jeffery, “Descen-
dants”) to them like a family. 
This weight is felt in every line 
she speaks and every action she 
takes. As she says to Michael 
(Dayo Okeniyi, “The Hunger 
Games”), the rookie under her 
supervision whose grave mis-
take is covered up by Wozniak, 
“All he (Wozniak) expects in 
return is loyalty.” 

Rather than a handful of good 

cops who take down hardened 
criminals one by one in a tradi-
tional obstacle ridden, emotional-
ly transparent plot structure, we 
are provided with a team whose 
loyalty to one another makes 
them impervious to the conse-
quences of their abuse of power. 
Though their intentions are good, 
it is unclear whether their meth-
ods of maintaining order ben-
efit them more then the citizens 
they are supposed to protect. 
Under their corrupt system, they 
methodically accept bribes from 
commonplace drug dealers in 
exchange for freedom to continue 
operating under the unit’s rules.

In a time when corruption is 

rampant and police conduct is 
under intense scrutiny, the show 
draws attention to the morally 
gray area in which authorities 
justify their actions in the name 
of protecting law and order (and 
themselves). Rather than another 
crime series centered on justice-

upholding 
straight-shooters, 

“Shades of Blue” critically con-
siders what motivates how police 
forces carry out their duties and 
how their relationships both in 
and out of the precinct influence 
their actions. This added element 
to the standard crime drama pro-
vides a host of possibilities for 
both plot and character develop-
ment, but sorely lacks the satisfac-
tion derived from seeing the chase 
that leads to bad guys getting put 
behind bars.

Despite the lack of actual crime 

solving, the first episode creates 
suspense as Santos is faced with a 
chain of difficult decisions both in 
her job and personal life. Between 
her relationship with her daugh-
ter Cristina, her mentorship of 
Michael and her bond with col-
leagues, Santos exhibits an emo-
tional range that adds depth to 
her character and makes it clear 
Lopez was the perfect fit for her 
role. In this series, the “American 
Idol” judge and pop diva sheds 
her playful charm and takes on a 
more serious role, bringing for-
ward uncompromising sincerity 
and a tough attitude.

Lopez’s compelling character 

and performance coupled with a 
topical look at how police forces 
should operate under complex 
circumstances, places “Shades of 
Blue” among the top shows pre-
miering on NBC this season. An 
update to the crime drama has 
been long overdue, and while it 
is uncertain how the various ele-
ments of “Shades of Blue” will 
play out in its forthcoming epi-
sodes, there is plenty of incen-
tive to continue watching.

Difficult ‘Crime’

Second season 
tackles athletics 
and sexual assault

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

I’ve been playing with a con-

cept for a while called “eat your 
vegetables 
television.” 
This 

phrase 
repre-

sents TV that’s 
difficult 
to 

enjoyably watch 
but 
remains 

necessary 
viewing either 
because of its 
cultural 
value 

or importance 
to the pop cul-
ture landscape. 
One 
example 

of 
“eat 
your 

vegetables TV” 
is the first season of the HBO 
drama “The Leftovers,” which, 
while great, was slow in its pac-
ing and therefore somewhat of 
a chore to watch. Going into the 
second season premiere, I was 
fully prepared to give “American 
Crime” a similar review based 
on what I saw of the first season, 
but my opinion changed when I 
pressed play. “American Crime” 
is deliberately tense, making sure 
the viewer is unsettled at every 
point possible in the episode. It’s 
incredibly tough to watch, but 
there are few better shows on 
network television.

The second season of “Ameri-

can Crime” follows a differ-

ent story from the first season, 
one which is all too familiar if 
you’ve read the sports pages 
recently. In the first episode, 
Taylor Blaine (Connor Jessup, 
“Falling Skies”), a scholarship 
student at a prestigious private 
school in Indiana, finds himself 
expelled from school after pic-
tures of him looking drunk were 
taken at a basketball team party. 
When his mom Anne (Lili Taylor, 
“The Conjuring”) confronts him 
about it, he tells her members of 
the team drugged and sexually 
assaulted him at the party. After 
Anne brings the accusation to 
the school’s headmistress (Felic-
ity Huffman, “Desperate House-
wives”), she and the basketball 
coach (Timothy Hutton, “Lever-
age”) have to deal with the impli-
cations of the accusation.

The story resonates particu-

larly in the context of the accu-
sations brought forth against 
athletes such as Jameis Winston 
and Greg Hardy, both currently 
playing in the NFL. The first epi-
sode takes a substantial amount of 
time to establish how important 
basketball is to this school and the 
people in its community. This pro-
gram is as important to the school 
as football is to Florida State Uni-
versity (Winston’s alma mater). 
Touching on the accusation and 
the school’s lacking response, the 
hour suggests a future indictment 
against this type of sports culture, 
which sweeps actions like rape 
under the rug.

“American Crime” achieves 

a sense of claustrophobia and 
discomfort though its direction, 
expertly done by creator and 

writer John Ridley (who won an 
Oscar for his “12 Years a Slave” 
screenplay). Every shot appears 
to be deliberate, with the cam-
era placement adding to the look 
and feel of a scene, especially in 
the second half of the episode. 
As the situation becomes clear 
and word starts to spread, the 
scenes are shot in intimate close-
ups. For example, in the scenes 
where Anne talks to the head-
mistress, her emotion is strongly 
felt because it’s put right in front 
of you without anything in the 
way. Showcasing the sadness in 
this manner, it makes watching 
her pain even tougher and more 
gut-wrenching.

“American Crime” also has a 

huge ensemble whose perfor-
mances brings additional gravi-
tas. Hutton and Hoffman were 
nominated for Emmys for their 
performances in season one, 
and they do a good job as they’re 
asked to make you care about 
two new and highly unsympa-
thetic characters (they’re failing 
to investigate a rape, after all). 
Who I’m most impressed by is 
Jessup, who didn’t show much 
range or ability at all on “Falling 
Skies” and actually seems genu-
ine in his emotional turmoil as a 
rape survivior.

Yes, “American Crime” is not 

the easiest show, but if you’re not 
watching it, you really should 
be. No other series on the major 
networks is tackling a storyline 
about the intersection of crime 
and athletics with this much 
intelligence and gravity, and very 
few are this well put together by 
their cast and crew.

TV REVIEW
Manipulating ‘Fields’

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Humans enjoy the macabre. 

Our voyeuristic interest can 
be piqued by films or televi-
sion 
shows, 

but when the 
stories being 
related to us 
are preceded 
by the disclo-
sure that what 
we’re 
about 

to 
watch 
is 

based 
on 
a 

true story, our 
level of fasci-
nation jumps 
upwards.

“Killing Fields,” Discovery’s 

new true-crime documentary 
series shot in real time, relies 
on this natural morbid curios-
ity. The pilot, “A Body in the 
Bayou” (a title strangely remi-
niscent of “Bones”) opens with 
beautiful shots of the Louisiana 
bayous. The camera then cuts 
to a man wearing a wifebeater, 
only partially lit, explaining 
that people talk about beauti-
ful the scenic land is, but they 
don’t know “it’s nothin’ but kil-
lin’ fields.”

The show follows this man, 

Detective Rodie Sanchez, as 
he comes out of retirement to 
work a cold case he hasn’t been 
able to put to rest in his mind: 
the unsolved homicide of young 
Eugenie Boisfontaine, whose 

body was found three months 
after 
her 
disappearance 
in 

1997 in Iberville Parish, LA. 
Throughout the episode, more 
evidence comes to light, like 
indications of blunt force trau-
ma to the head and rape. The 
episode ends with the startling 
and grim reveal that the DNA 
found on Boisfontaine’s under-
clothes comes from two or pos-
sibly three different males.

Sanchez teams up with a 

younger 
detective, 
Aubrey 

St. Angelo, to work the case. 
While the two seem to work 
well together, bringing differ-
ent perspectives to the case, the 
show emphasizes the old cop/
young cop dichotomy more than 
is needed — it’s already obvious. 
This slightly forced dynamic 
culminates in a conversation 
that sounds straight out of a 
campy ’80s detective movie. 
As they’re sitting in a car wait-
ing for someone, Sanchez, after 
posing personal questions that 
Det. Angelo deflects, says, “You 
don’t wanna make conversation 
with me? You act like I’m your 
wife, or your girlfriend or some-
thing, you know, like we out on 
a date — ” before Angelo cuts 
him off, having seen the person 
for whom they’re waiting.

Some aspects of “Killing 

Fields” feel jarringly staged, 
even though it doesn’t exploit 
the victim’s story or her fam-
ily’s pain. Sanchez’s gravelly 
voiceover generally works, but 

though his sentiments read 
realistically, some of his lines 
sound contrived, like “The 
cases you don’t solve will haunt 
you until the day you die,” and 
“I think the killer’s still out 
there.” This is partially due to 
the dramatic drumbeats that 
accompany almost every single 
minute; meant to emphasize 
dramatic reveals or discoveries, 
the score only works against 
the veracity of the moment. 
The people in the show are 
always uncomfortably aware 
of the camera, especially when 
they’re trying their hardest not 
to be — like a scene in which 
the detectives’ silhouettes are 
outlined by the light of a fire, 
crackling in slow motion, or 
the scene where they go to talk 
to the woman who originally 
found Boisfontaine’s body — 
the framing of which feels like 
it could have been lifted out of 
“Law and Order: SVU.”

“Killing Fields” relies on 

our curiosity about true hor-
ror stories, but it also attempts 
to escalate the tension through 
these kinds of transparent and 
unnecessary stylistic choices. 
The true story of the show — an 
unsolved murder, a killer pos-
sibly still on the loose and the 
dark irony of beautiful land 
shrouding the bodies of people 
who met untimely deaths — 
is intriguing, depressing and 
haunting. But this televised 
account of it? Not so much.

SUMMER EMPLOYMENT
FOR RENT

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

wheel is to its desert skyline. I 

danced along to Galantis’s uplift-
ing progressive house until it 
was time to go meet Will Clarke, 
who had played earlier that day. 
Though I was still stuck in a car 
during his live set, after perus-
ing his Soundcloud I can say 
with certainty that Will’s British 
accent is almost as delightful to 
listen to as his music.

Lucky for me and anyone who 

knows him, the dedication and 
talent apparent in Will’s work, 
combined with his normal dude-
ness, makes listening to him play 
and listening to him talk equally 
as nice. For example, he calls 
Ibiza, Spain his second home 
after spending five summers 
there with a residency at the 
nightclub Orange Corner, but 
makes fun of his terrible Span-
ish. He’s been working with the 
renowned Dirtybird for a year 
now, and refers to the group as 
a family in an industry where 
people tend to focus mainly 
on themselves. At Dirtybird, 
he said, “everyone looks after 
everyone.” He talked about how 
he prefers to go with the flow of 
an evening rather than plan a 
show, and reminisced about one 
night on his Australian tour dur-
ing which a one-hour set turned 
into a six-hour set that led him 
to stray from his usual house 
music into the funky world of 
disco. And he really likes what 
he does. “Ninety percent of my 
sets is my own music,” he said, 
adding that a goal for this year is 
to write enough music to pull off 
a three hour set of just his own 
stuff. Spoken like a musical pur-
ist, he acknowledged that all this 
music likely won’t be released, 
but it doesn’t bother him. 

Living the life of a true rock-

star, Will was off at 6 a.m. the 
following day to head for Detroit. 
He’ll be back in our neck of 
the woods to play Grasshopper 
Underground with Billy Kenny 
as part of the Will and Bill’s 
Excellent Adventure tour. So if 
you like good music that happens 
to be house music that maybe 
sometimes morphs into disco, 
you should go. As the name sug-
gests, it’s going to be excellent.

Jack Ü ended day one with 

just the kind of set I’d expect 
from a duo whose members have 
become some of the top authori-
ties in the electronic music world. 
At this point in their careers, the 

industry’s most bromantic part-
ners can pretty much do what-
ever they want, which, in an 
exquisite display of ego, included 
having Skrillex work the crowd 
into an eager chant of “DIP-LO, 
DIP-LO, DIP-LO…” just for fun-
sies. They seemed to be going for 
audience recognition, dropping 
in the screeching “call 911 now” 
lyric from Skrillex’s “First Of The 
Year” alongside Diplo’s twerk-
worthy “Express Yourself” and 
working in songs by the likes of 
Flux Pavilion, Kanye, Icona Pop 
and Drake. Yes, like everyone 
and their mother, Jack Ü sampled 
“Hotline Bling” and “How Deep 
Is Your Love,” which I’m really 
hoping are two trends the new 
year will put to rest.

I wrapped up my day with an 

after party at a classic ski town 
dive bar called Whisky Dick’s 
(and yes, we made millions of 
penis jokes throughout the eve-
ning because it’s fun to pretend 
like you’re 12). Hippie Sabotage, 
who played earlier that day, 
went on to a relatively empty 
room where everyone was hav-
ing a good time — not neces-
sarily because of the music. 
That dynamic changed with 
the gradual realization that we 
just wanted our ears filled with 
bass again, and the Hippie Sabo-
tage brothers—who individu-
ally go by So Crates and Sour 
Beats —were giving us just that. 
By the end of the performance, 
the whole room felt the hype of 
their better known remixes of 
kiiara’s “Gold” and Tove Lo’s 
“Stay High”, the latter of which 
earned 
them 
international 

attention after Ellie Goulding 
posted about it on Instagram … 
oh, the digital age.

It also earned them quite a bit 

of record label trouble. The lovely 
boys of Hippie Sabotage indulged 
the 
crowd’s 
“one 
moreeee!” 

chant with a song called “They 
Stole My Face and You’d Never 
Know It,” a melodic attack on a 
label contract gone wrong that 
was deleted from the Internet 
three hours after its original 
posting. Essentially, the story 
is that the label took all their 
money after the success of “Stay 
High” and prevented them from 
releasing the music they wanted. 
Anger was more than evident 
in the way they screamed along 
to their song: “Sold a million 
records I ain’t got a cent … BURN 
IT DOWN!” but I have to say, the 
transition from vibey to pissed 
off made for an excellent finale.

The 
following 
day 
began 

with a comedy/hip-hop set by 
Lil Dicky who, as I was told by 
friends who are more avid fans 
than me, loves to poke fun at his 
skinny Jewish-boy-ness. In my 
limited research into his career, 
I discovered that he went from 
advertising executive to rap-
per, which probably explains his 
move to get out in front of pos-
sible artistic critique with songs 
full of irony about his own posi-
tion in the music industry. His 
performance was top notch, per-
forming crowd favorite “Lemme 
Freak” with the most earnest, 
Oscar-worthy wide eyes that 
almost made mine tear up from 
laughing so hard. I was con-
vinced that he was convinced 
that getting laid by the girl he’d 
brought on stage (apparently 
a common practice of his) was 
the most important thing in the 
world, and it kind of made me 
root for the guy … though some-
thing tells me he doesn’t need 
my good wishes to get lucky.

The whole world seemed to 

slow down when Chet Faker 
took over, and his set offered 
a nice breather before the rest 
of the evening found me run-
ning between various overlap-
ping sets. The whole venue was 
small enough for my crazy plan 
to mostly work, catching the 
beginning of Alison Wonderland, 
the middle of Kaskade and the 
end of Autograf. Of course, the 
problem was that by the time I 
got to wherever I was going I 
was confined to the outskirts of 
the crowd, which was especially 
torturous during Alison Wonder-
land’s set. She played a stage that, 
thanks to a reappearing totem, 
came to be known as the trap 
tent … but by the time I got there I 
WAS TRAPPED OUTSIDE THE 
FUCKING TRAP TENT. Saying I 
could barely hear the music is an 
exaggeration, but I wanted her 
to make my ears ring and while 
a relatively small venue makes it 
easy to hop around, it also forces 
individual stages to be relatively 
quiet so as not to overtake the 
others.

Nevertheless, 
a 
wonder-

fully wide range of styles was 
heard between the three stages 
that night. Alison Wonderland 
was a riot as always, stopping 
the party for no man or pair of 
pants. Kaskade got lots of love 
for his smooth electro house 
set—even from the painfully all-
ages crowd, who were no doubt 
expecting some big room and 
ridiculously massive drops. Like 
a pro, he included enough main 
stageworthy beats among more 
refined tunes in a set that kept 
everyone happy, from the gaggle 
of 16-year-old girls whose moms 
would pick them up and make 
them dinner later, to the listener 
who’s been with him throughout 
his 20-year career. Elsewhere, 
Autograf created a trippy-dippy 
time capsule that transported 
the festival’s only fully enclosed 
stage back to the ’70s with their 
distinctly Chicago house sound. 
For Autograf, part of the ben-
efit of coming around post-’70s 
is that we’ve already been given 
Nirvana, which allowed the 
trio to artfully weave a remix of 
“Smells Like Teen Spirit” into 
their set, alongside exceptionally 
popular originals like “Dream” 
and “Metaphysical.”

I was fortunate enough to 

start the final day chatting with 
Jackson Stell, aka Big Wild, who 
developed the name about a year 
ago with the idea of being adven-
turous in the sounds he explores 
and creates. He’s certainly risen 
quickly up the ranks, with over 
100 shows under his belt from 
2015, and plans to release either 
an EP or an album by the end of 
the summer.

“I’ve been focusing on mak-

ing a really special body of 
work,” he said, excited about 
his upcoming show-free three 
months he intends to use to 
work on the project.

Since he only plays his own 

music, he has a limited amount 
of songs he can choose from, 
and is eager to increase the 
flexibility of his live perfor-
mances while looking for new 
sonic opportunities to give his 
audience the feels.

“I’m trying to get an emotion 

out of the listener, but I’m trying 
to use sounds and a style that gets 
it out in a unique way,” he said.

closers in the rest of Assaf’s

20TH CENTURY FOX

Aiming for an Oscar.
The brutal poetry 
of ‘The Revenant’

DiCaprio film will 
leave audiences 

speechless

By JACOB RICH

Senior Arts Editor

“The Revenant” asks a lot of 

its audience, but it gives so much 
back.

Like all great 

historical epics, 
“The Revenant” 
strikes a bal-
ance 
between 

mythology 
and 
realism. 

Here, 
Alejan-

dro 
Gonzáles 

Iñárritu (“Bird-
man”) 
turns 

the classic American myth of the 
mountain men into an indulgent 
treatise on the human animal. 
In his West, humanity regresses 
once more into pure instinc-
tual survival, and sheer brutal-
ity determines who receives the 
bounty of the untouched wil-
derness. Centering on a conflict 
between two men, “The Reve-
nant” paints a greater picture of a 
lawless America.

Leonardo DiCaprio (“The Wolf 

of Wall Street”) is Hugh Glass — 
less a character and more anguish 
incarnate. After being mauled 
by a bear 
on 
a 
hunting 

expedition, 
he’s left for dead 

without food or supplies and must 
travel 200 miles back to civiliza-
tion. His is a true story you may 
have heard before — it’s been 
retold many times in American 
fiction and, more recently, shared 
frequently on social media. His 
beaten, pained struggle is depict-
ed intimately and ferociously. 
While DiCaprio embraced his 
slick, pretty-boy frattiness in 
“The Wolf of Wall Street” to bril-
liant effect, he completely sheds it 
here. You’ll forget about the kid in 
“Titanic.” Regardless of whether 
or not Leo gets the Oscar gold for 
this one, he’s thoroughly demon-
strated his range.

His nemesis, John Fitzgerald 

(Tom Hardy, “Mad Max: Fury 
Road”), provides the perfect foil 
to Glass’s legendary hero. Tom 
Hardy has a hyper-masculine 
gruffness in many of his mov-
ies, but the man has so much tal-
ent that he rarely treads familiar 
ground. Whether he’s playing 
Bane, Mad Max or Fitzgerald, 
he’s a different enough badass to 
remain thoroughly engaging. He 
is truly one of the greatest lead-
ing men in the business, and his 
turn here as a villain with pain-
fully human motives is one of his 
greatest roles.

This is a two-and-a-half hour 

epic. Human pain and suffering 
are a constant, and the utter bru-
tality of it all is often tough to sit 
through. What’s so special about 

the violence in this film, though, 
is that it never feels like movie 
violence, like that in “The Hateful 
Eight.” There’s a time and place 
for over-the-top gore, but the 
decision to keep the violence real-
istically horrifying adds so much 
to “The Revenant” ’s impact. A 
Tarantino revenge picture this is 
not.

But the key to this film is not 

the 
immaculately 
sequenced 

battle scenes, as impressive as 
they are. It’s the immaculate 
portraiture of the American 
West performed by cinematog-
rapher Emmanuel Lubezki (who 
also worked with Iñárritu on 
“Birdman”). Each frame of this 
film is masterful nature photog-
raphy. And like a lion curled up 
on a warm rock, Lubezki lingers. 
And lingers some more. Instead 
of assigning nature a nihilistic 
hopelessness like in “The Hate-
ful Eight,” Lubezki’s nature is 
imbued with religious purpose. 
It’s an indulgence in the instinc-
tual human affinity to nature. 
Rarely has a film felt so present in 
its setting. In the time you spend 
with “The Revenant,” you will be 
there. It won’t be comfortable.

The procession out of my 

showing 
of 
“The 
Revenant” 

could only be described as a 
funeral dirge. Never have I seen 
a more silent crowd shuffling out 
of a packed theater. Take that as 
you will.

Season Review: Defensive Line

Despite numerous 
injuries, unit turned 

in strong season

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Editor’s 
Note: 
With 
the 

Michigan football team’s 2015 
regular season in the books, 
the Daily looks back at the 
performance of each unit this year 
and looks ahead to the future in 
2016. In this edition: linebackers.

The Michigan defensive line 

suffered injury after injury after 
injury throughout the season, 
starting in fall camp all the way 
to Week 5 and Week 9. As the 
year wore on, the health issues 
tested the unit’s depth. And still, 
the line ended up being one of the 
best in college football.

Before the season started, 

the unit looked like it could be 
one of the country’s elite units. 
It returned all but two players 
from a strong 2014 group. Its 
top players, like redshirt juniors 
Chris Wormley and Willie Henry, 
were finally seasoned and ready 
to step up. The defensive line 
maintained the only holdover 
from the 2014 coaching staff, 
Greg Mattison.

When the Wolverines entered 

fall camp, they unleashed a 
bevy of familiar names: Henry, 
Wormley, senior Mario Ojemudia 
and junior Taco Charlton on 
the ends; redshirt junior Ryan 
Glasgow, 
sophomore 
Bryan 

Mone, 
redshirt 
sophomore 

Maurice Hurst and redshirt 
junior Matt Godin on the interior.

As it turned out, Michigan 

needed every one of them. All but 
Mone — who missed the entire 
season with an injury — started a 
game up front.

And the Wolverines lived up 

to their billing. They made 2.5 
sacks and 6.8 tackles for loss per 
game. They disrupted opposing 
backfields all season long, playing 
their best football in a five-game 
stretch early in the season, in 
which they gave up 14 total 
points. And on an elite defense, 
perhaps the line featured the 
most playmakers: Wormley (14.5 

tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks), 
Henry (10 and 6.5), Charlton (8.5 
and 5.5) and Hurst (6.5 and three).

Even when Michigan’s line 

struggled, those stars were a 
handful for opponents. Mone’s 
injury depleted the Wolverines’ 
depth, but the starting core was 
still intact. But then Ojemudia 
tore his Achilles at Maryland on 
Oct. 3, and senior Royce Jenkins-
Stone filled in at the hybrid buck 
position. Finally, redshirt junior 
Ryan Glasgow injured his shoulder 
against Rutgers on Nov. 7. After 
three 
season-ending 
injuries, 

Michigan had to head into its 
toughest stretch of the season, 
playing fatigued at the end of the 
year with its fewest personnel.

The losses finally showed. 

After giving up fewer than 100 
rushing yards in six of the first 
nine games and averaging 2.7 
sacks in that span, the Wolverines 
trailed off in November before 
finishing with another strong 
performance in the Citrus Bowl 
victory against Florida.

HIGH POINT: It’s tough to 

pick out one individual game in 
the first half of the season because 
Michigan’s defensive front was so 
dominant throughout the season. 
But the line’s best performance 
may have come Oct. 10 against 

Northwestern.

Just 
the 
week 
before, 

Ojemudia 
was 
lost 
for 
the 

season, yet Jenkins-Stone filled 
in seamlessly. The Wolverines 
tied a season high with four 
sacks and totaled eight tackles 
for loss. And while offense 
wasn’t 
the 
Wildcats’ 
strong 

suit, Michigan still pulled off its 
third straight shutout against a 
ranked opponent in a dominant 
38-0 
victory 
at 
Michigan 

Stadium. That win helped build 
the Wolverines’ national hype 
perhaps more than any other 
this season.

LOW 
POINT: 
While 

Michigan gave up its most 
rushing yards of the season Nov. 
28 against Ohio State, the more 
shocking 
performance 
came 

two weeks earlier at Indiana. 
Playing without Glasgow for the 
first time, the Wolverines had no 
answers for the Hoosiers’ spread 
rushing 
attack, 
surrendering 

307 yards rushing on 55 carries. 
Their thin defensive line showed 
as Indiana ran zone-read plays 
repeatedly for the duration of 
the game.

Only when the Wolverines 

came up with a goal-line stand 
in double overtime did Michigan 
secure a victory against the 

Hoosiers, who finished 6-7.

THE 
FUTURE: 
Michigan 

made do with makeshift lineups 
up front for most of this season. 
Next year, with almost everyone 
returning, and if they can stay 
healthy, the Wolverines should 
be even better.

The 
loss 
of 
Henry, 
who 

announced 
Wednesday 
night 

on Twitter that he will forgo 
his senior season and enter the 
NFL Draft, will leave a hole. 
As well, Ojemudia’s eligibility 
has also been exhausted. But if 
Michigan learned one thing this 
season, it’s that it can overcome 
personnel losses on its defensive 
line. Wormley, the leader of the 
group for most of the season, will 
return. If Mone and Glasgow 
come back healthy, they can help 
fill in the losses.

Depending on the scheme 

new defensive coordinator Don 
Brown runs, a rough defensive 
front 
could 
start 
Wormley, 

Charlton, Hurst and Glasgow. 
Mone, 
Godin 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore Lawrence Marshall, 
and Michigan is still in the mix 
for five-star recruit Rashan Gary.

And with Mattison returning 

for another year coaching the 
line, the unit is in good shape for 
the future.

‘M’ heads into Columbus 
on four-game win streak

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

After its sweep of in-state 

rival Michigan State, the No. 6 
Michigan hockey team regained 
its spot as the 
nation’s 
best 

offense.

The 

Wolverines 
are 
currently 

averaging 
4.68 goals — a 
number 
that 

grew after this 
past 
weekend, 

when 
they 

scored 15 goals 
in two contests 
against 
the 

Spartans.

Now, a week 

later, the next 
team 
to 
try 

and 
stymie 

Michigan’s 
electrifying offense is Ohio State. 
Struggling out of the gate, the 
Buckeyes 
started 
the 
season 

winning just four of their first 
15 contests. But recently, the 
Buckeyes have looked like a 
different team.

Over Winter Break, Ohio 

State traveled to Florida and 
beat then-No. 4 Boston College, 
3-2, before crushing then-No. 8 
Cornell, 8-0, to win the Florida 
College Classic title.

“Ohio State had a big couple 

wins down in Florida, and they’re 
hot right now, so we’re not taking 
them lightly,” said sophomore 
forward Dexter Dancs. “That’s 
for sure.”

But the Wolverines are also 

currently playing what seems like 
their best hockey at this point. 
They have scored 22 goals in 
their last four games, conceding 

just nine.

Their offense has caught fire 

lately for multiple reasons — 
mainly due to the first line of 
junior forwards Tyler Motte 
and JT Compher and freshman 
forward Kyle Connor.

The trio has been unstoppable 

since it started playing on the 
same line, and Big Ten statistics 
support this. Connor, Compher 
and Motte are first, second 
and third, respectively, in the 
Big Ten point-scoring race. 
Connor has been particularly 
sensational, notching 15 points 
in his last six games. His 31 
points on the season are good 
for fourth in the country.

Despite the star trio, it has 

been the play of the fourth line — 
sophomore forward Dexter Dancs 
and junior forward Max Shuart 
— that has helped carry some of 
the load lately. Dancs notched two 
tallies against the Spartans, and 

said most of his and the team’s 
success stems from their tight 
bond.

“We’re having a ton of fun,” he 

said. “The team is extremely tight, 
the boys love coming to the rink 
and it’s the best part of the day for 
us. Right now, everything is just 
fun, even the lifts.”

Michigan has also seen a jolt 

from 
sophomore 
defenseman 

Zach 
Werenski, 
who 
played 

last weekend in his first series 
since 
captaining 
the 
United 

States World Junior team in the 
World Junior Championships in 
Helsinki.

Werenski 
registered 
two 

goals and an assist against 
the Spartans. After one of 
his goals, he paid his dues to 
former Wolverine Carl Hagelin, 
celebrating the goal by playing 
the violin on his arm with his 
stick.

Dancs 
said 
Werenski 
can 

get by with celebrating goals 
like that because he is just that 
skilled. Werenski said he still 
got a message from coach Red 
Berenson about going overboard 
with celebrations.

It wouldn’t be surprising if 

this Friday’s game in Columbus 
is high-scoring. After all, the 
first time the two teams met in 
Columbus last season, Michigan 
won a wild 10-6 contest, and its 
offense is just as good as last 
year. It’s no longer shocking if 
the Wolverines score five-plus 
goals a night.

“I think something pretty 

similar to (Michigan) State,” 
Werenski 
said 
about 
his 

expectations of the upcoming 
series. “I’d guess the games would 
be a little bit closer. They are a 
good team, block a lot of shots and 
it will be a battle.

“I hope we score 10 and they 

score none.”

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Zach Werenski has fully readjusted after spending almost a month in Helsinki for the World Junior Championships.

Wolverines to host 
meet Saturday for 
autism awareness

By PAIGE VOEFFRAY

For the Daily

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

gymnastics team is competing 
against Ohio State on Saturday, 
but 
for 
the 

Wolverines, 
it’s 
all 
about 

Johnny Leone.

For the third 

straight 
year, 

Michigan 
is 

pairing 
with 

the Ted Lindsay 
Foundation 
and 
Autism 

Speaks to hold 
an 
autism 

awareness 
meet. 
The 

Wolverines 
feel autism is often overlooked, 
though it is gaining awareness 
throughout the country. Michigan 
had an opportunity to get to know 
someone with autism, 18-year-old 
Leone, giving the team insight 
into the disorder.

“We’ve been able to meet a 

ton of really great and talented 
kids through the process of 
doing this autism meet for the 
past three years, so it’s always 
something 
we 
really 
look 

forward to,” said senior Lindsay 
Williams. “With all that we’ve 
learned about it, we’re really 
excited to help everyone who 
comes out to the meet to learn 
about it as well.”

The Michigan men’s hockey 

team will also be in attendance 
at the upcoming meet to help 
support the cause. In October, 
the hockey team had an autism 
awareness game, and some of 
the women from the gymnastics 
team went to support the hockey 
team and their cause.

“I don’t think gymnastics 

and hockey are two sports 
that you would think would 
be associated together,” said 
senior Briley Casanova. “I think 
it’s great that we have two very 
different sports supporting each 
other and also having a common 
goal in spreading awareness 
about one cause.”

That’s not to say the Wolverines 

won’t be focused on winning the 
meet. The team is tied for No. 1 in 
the nation in just its second week 
of the season – the challenge now 
shifts to staying there.

“It’s a really nice motivation 

to our team to get them to really 
believe that they deserve to be 
competing with the very top teams 
in the country and they’re capable 
of doing that,” said Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki. “We’ve really 
talked about the fact that we need 
to expect ourselves to be at the 
Super Six, and we need to believe 
that we have the ability to win the 
National Championship.”

The team has set the standard 

high for the rest of the season. 
After multiple athletes achieved 
personal-best 
scores 
against 

then-No. 9 Georgia on Saturday 
to go with a team win, they are 
excited for what the rest of the 
season has to offer.

But the Wolverines did not 

come away from their meet 
against Georgia unscathed. At 
each event an athlete fell early 
within 
the 
rotation, 
adding 

pressure 
on 
the 
women 
to 

perform their routines cleanly. 
Going 
into 
Saturday’s 
meet 

against the Buckeyes, Michigan 
hopes to work on its consistency 
and keep the positive energy up 
throughout the meet. 

And most importantly, the 

team hopes spectators will come 
not just for gymnastics, but also 
for the cause.

Partridge hired as 
full-time assistant

By MAX BULTMAN

Managing Sports Editor

Chris Partridge has been 

named the Michigan football 
team’s 
special 
teams 
and 

linebackers coach, the team 
announced 
Thursday 
via 
a 

press release.

Partridge had been the team’s 

director of player personnel 
for the 2015 season, but he also 
served as its linebackers coach 
for the Citrus Bowl after former 
defensive 
coordinator 
and 

linebackers coach D.J. Durkin 
left to become the head coach at 
Maryland.

After Michigan lost Durkin to 

the Terrapins and former special 
teams coordinator John Baxter 
to Southern California last week, 
Partridge will fill both vacancies.

“Chris has a proven track 

record as a successful coach,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
via the release. “He has brought 
a lot of energy and enthusiasm to 
his work as our director of player 
personnel. I know that same 
passion will be exhibited in his 

work with our student-athletes.”

Prior to coming to Michigan, 

Partridge worked from 2010 to 
2014 as the head coach at Paramus 
Catholic High School in Paramus, 
N.J., the alma mater of redshirt 
freshman safety Jabrill Peppers 
and the current home of the 
nation’s No. 1 recruit, defensive 
tackle Rashan Gary.

Partridge received positive 

reviews from players for his work 
as interim linebackers coach for 
the Citrus Bowl. He inherits a 
group of linebackers that will 
lose three starters going into 
next year, and a special teams 
group that finished the season 
tied for 12th in special teams 
efficiency under Baxter.

“I came to Michigan because 

I wanted to work with the 
best and learn from the best,” 
Partridge said in the release. “I 
couldn’t have a better mentor 
than 
coach 
Harbaugh 
who 

shares my vision that the student 
athletes come first. I am honored 
by his confidence and for the 
opportunity to continue to serve 
this incredibility (sic) institution.”

Donnal thinking less, playing more

Junior excelling 
through three 

games of return to 

starting lineup

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Three games into the season, 

junior forward Mark Donnal lost 
his confidence and his starting 
spot in the lineup. 

Donnal tallied just 12 points 

in the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s first three contests. In the 
Wolverines’ next game against 
Connecticut at the Battle 4 
Atlantis in the Bahamas, Donnal 
wasn’t just scratched from the 
starting rotation — he didn’t play 
at all. He quickly dropped from 
Michigan’s top big man to its last 
option off the bench.

His minutes were dwindling 

and so was his focus. He was 
overthinking the game.

Then Big Ten play began, and 

suddenly he wasn’t.

“I’m not necessarily sure what 

exactly it was (that changed),” 
Donnal said. “But I got the 
confidence 
rolling 
after 
the 

Illinois game and just kind of 
built off that.” 

After impressing Michigan 

coach John Beilein in practice 
leading up to Michigan’s Big 
Ten opener against the Illini 
two weeks ago, Donnal got an 
opportunity to put his refocused 
game on display. After coming 
off the bench in Champaign, 
he dropped eight points in 11 
minutes of first-half work and 
earned a spot in the starting 
lineup in the second frame. He 
finished the game with a career-
high 26 points and his old spot 
in the starting five. Three days 
later, Donnal continued to make 
his case, dropping 16 points at 
home against Penn State.

Tuesday 
night, 
Donnal’s 

think-less, do-more game plan 
worked again, helping Michigan 
edge No. 3 Maryland, 70-67. He 
had just eight points and went 
0-for-3 on 3-point attempts, but 
he did the little things right.

“I’m just going out, playing 

my game, being a ball player,” 
Donnal said after the win. 
“That’s what I got recruited for, 
and I think that’s a big thing for 
me, just playing my game. I’m 
not traditionally focused on all 
the X’s and O’s and overthinking 
things — I think I’ve just done a 
better job of playing my game.”

With Michigan up six points 

late in the first half, Donnal had 
two blocks in 12 seconds. With 
less 
than 
a 

minute 
left, 

he stepped up 
and got a hand 
on 
the 
ball 

as 
Maryland 

guard Rasheed 
Sulaimon 
drove to the 
hoop, knocking 
the ball out of 
bounds. After 
the Terrapins 
inbounded the ball, forward 
Robert Carter Jr. tried a jumper 
from inside the paint only to have 
the ball swatted by Donnal, who 
snuck in from behind him.

The 
Wolverines 
recovered 

the loose ball and, after calling a 
timeout, set up their offense for one 
final shot at the end of the frame. 
Junior guard Zak Irvin missed a 
3-pointer from straightaway, but 

Donnal was right under the hoop 
and, amid a handful of Maryland 
bodies, tipped in Irvin’s miss as 
time expired.

He took the hand he had just 

tipped the ball in with, clenched 
it, pumped his fist and yelled. He 
marched over toward Michigan’s 
bench and was greeted by high 
fives and chest bumps. The 
Wolverines were headed to the 
locker room up 37-29 on the 

third-ranked 
Terrapins, and 
Donnal — the 
same guy who 
was 
benched 

three 
games 

into the season 
— had a lot to 
do with it. 

Late 
in 

the 
second 

half, 
Donnal 

came 
up 
big 

again. With less than 15 seconds 
remaining, he fought off two 
Maryland defenders to grab an 
offensive board off a missed layup 
by junior guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. Michigan called a timeout, and 
after Donnal received the inbound, 
the Terrapins were forced to foul. 
The junior made only the front 
end of the 1-and-1 opportunity, 
allowing Maryland an opportunity 

to tie the game late.

The 
Terrapins 
brought 

the ball down the court and 
an 
offensive 
screen 
forced 

Michigan to switch on defense, 
pinning Donnal on Sulaimon 
— Maryland’s best option from 
behind the arc. Sulaimon backed 
up and fired from deep over the 
outstretched arm of Donnal, but 
the shot missed, clinching the 
victory for the Wolverines.

“He’s playing with a little 

swag. And we all need that, but 
there’s some young men that 
probably need that more because 
they’re just gentle giants, and 
you can’t survive this league 
being a gentle giant,” Beilein said 
on the Huge Show on Thursday.

In the four games since 

conference play has started, 
Donnal’s combined 57 points 
are more than he had the entire 
first half of the season. He’s done 
thinking about the little things 
on the court and is just focused 
on playing the game.

“It’s one of those things that 

comes with college basketball,” 
Donnal said. “All the different 
terminology 
and 
different 

plays 
and 
everything 
that’s 

being thrown at you, it’s easy to 
overthink, but today we were 
just playing basketball.”

“He’s playing 
with a little 
swag. And we 
all need that.”

Sophomore guard Katelynn Flaherty beat her scoring average by one with 23 points against Maryland, but the Wolverines lost, 74-67.
Michigan’s upset bid falls short

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball 
team 
needed 

something special if it was going 
to beat No. 8 Maryland. And it 
got that, in 
part, 
from 

Katelynn 
Flaherty’s 23 points. But even 
those types of performances have 
become rather commonplace for 
the sophomore guard.

The Wolverines (2-3 Big Ten, 

10-6 overall) fell, 74-67, to the 
Terrapins, who finally pulled 
away in the fourth quarter. 
Michigan hasn’t beaten a top-10 
opponent since January 2012 but 
gave Maryland one of its toughest 
games of the season on Thursday.

It took almost the full 40 

minutes for the Terrapins (4-1, 
15-2) to decisively grab the edge, 

but they eventually did so in the 
fourth quarter. After trailing by 
just three to start the quarter, 
Michigan couldn’t keep pace with 
Maryland’s speed.

The Wolverines scored just five 

field goals and two free throws in 
the last quarter.

The win drops Michigan back 

below .500 for conference play. 
And despite not being able to 
win a third straight game, the 
Wolverines may have put on one 
of their best performances.

“I said this at the beginning 

of the season: We can play with 
anyone,” Flaherty said. “We can 
win the Big Ten. Looking at all 
the games in the Big Ten, you can 
see how people lose and there are 
upsets. It’s just a reminder that we 
can still win.”

Flaherty’s biggest help came 

from 
the 
two 
post 
players, 

freshman center Hallie Thome 

and 
senior 
forward 
Kelsey 

Mitchell, but foul trouble had 
both in dangerous territory.

The pair combined for 24 points 

and 7 blocks, but each collected 
their fourth personal foul early in 
the final quarter.

“That really hurts us both 

offensively 
and 
defensively,” 

Flaherty 
said. 
“(Maryland) 

had two or three big girls 
down there, and I know we got 
outrebounded … and they get 
second-chance points.”

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico was forced to switch 
Mitchell and Thome in and out 
in the fourth quarter, and the 
lack of a dominant post presence 
hurt Michigan late. Maryland 
outrebounded Michigan, 15-5, 
in the fourth quarter. A trio of 
double-digit scorers for Maryland 
carried the Terrapins.

Her 
performance, 
though 

high-scoring, also included a 
3-for-15 shooting effort from 
the 3-point line. Eight of those 
attempts came in the fourth 
quarter, when the team was in 
need of a comeback.

“I don’t recall too many terrible 

shots, but when we’re down 10, 
and we’re trying to crawl back, 
and she has a open look, she has 
the green light,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We’d like her to make a little 
bit more than that, but she always 
has the green light.”

After 
last 
year’s 
26-point 

blowout 
loss 
to 
then-No. 
5 

Maryland, Michigan improved 
immensely to end the season. 
The final result doesn’t come as 
a surprise, but it aches for the 
Wolverines, because for most of 
the game, they were up to par with 
a team considered one of the best 
teams not only in the conference, 
but in the nation.

Offense falters 
with forwards 
in foul trouble

Mitchell, Thome 
forced to sit for 

most of second half 
of Wolverines’ loss

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

With the Michigan women’s 

basketball team down by two 
points, Hallie Thome caught 
the ball under the basket and 
dropped it.

Surrounded by Maryland’s 

defense, the freshman center 
scrambled to pick the ball back 
up and banked it into the basket 
while also drawing a foul. After 
draining her free throw to 
complete the and-1 play, Thome 
put her team 
up 
by 
two 

points 
with 

5:25 left in the 
third quarter.

But 
those 

were the last 
points that the 
Wolverines 
scored for the 
next six and a 
half minutes. 
In fact, it was 
Thome’s last shot until just eight 
seconds remained in the game, 
when she scored an irrelevant 
layup in Michigan’s loss to the 
eighth-ranked 
Terrapins 
at 

Crisler Center.

Though Thome ended the 

game with five boards and 15 
points on 7-for-11 shooting, she 
picked up her fourth foul just 22 
seconds into the fourth quarter. 
Instead of earning a third 
straight double-double, senior 
forward Kelsey Mitchell picked 
up her fourth foul a minute after 
Thome, finishing with just nine 
points and three rebounds.

The Wolverines were without 

their bigs, and Maryland quickly 
saw the opportunity to stretch a 
six-point game into a 16-point 
game, as Michigan’s offense 
went cold for five more minutes.

“We wanted to take away 

(Mitchell’s) tendencies,” said 
Maryland coach Brenda Frese. 
“We knew she was very active, 
and we wanted to attack inside 
and be really aggressive.”

Added Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico: “For both of 
them to go as long as they did 
in the game was great for us. … 
(But Maryland was) just so big, 
strong and physical inside.”

On 
the 
inside 
for 
the 

Terrapins was center Brionna 
Jones, whom the Wolverines 
double teamed. But Jones still 
scored 13 points alongside seven 
rebounds, just slightly under her 
season average.

Jones’ 
physicality 
— 
as 

well as that of the rest of the 
Terrapin squad — was too big of 
a challenge for Michigan, which 
was outrebounded, 43-38.

Without size, the Wolverines 

reverted to using their speed 
as an advantage in the waning 
minutes of the final frame, 
putting in players such as 

freshman guard Nicole Munger 
and sophomore forward Jillian 
Dunston, the latter of whom 
collected 
eight 
boards 
and 

helped clean up for Michigan’s 
two primary bigs.

Throughout 
the 
season, 

Barnes 
Arico 
knew 
Thome 

would need to step up her size 
and physicality when going up 
against Big Ten competition — 
nothing she had ever dreamed 
of seeing in high school. Despite 
dealing 
with 
foul 
trouble, 

though, Thome’s performance 
Thursday 
night 
greatly 

impressed Barnes Arico.

“Hallie’s biggest challenge 

right now is to gain that 
experience and to go against 
the best people of her size in 
the country,” Barnes Arico said. 
“For a freshman to come out and 

do that against 
the No. 8 team 
in the country 
is 
pretty 

impressive. 
But 
from 
a 

coaching 
perspective, 
I 
always 

want her to 
continue 
to 

get better and 
be a presence 

on the defensive end and really 
try to get stronger.

“That’s 
obviously 
not 

something 
that’s 
going 
to 

happen overnight.”

Added Thome: “Usually, the 

bigger the girl, the slower they 
move. I have to make sure I stay 
low so I can do my moves fast 
and just go up strong, because 
I’m not used to the physicality of 
it. I’m getting there.”

Suddenly 
lacking 
size 

and strength on the court, 
Michigan’s offense crumbled 
and went scoreless for more 
than 10 minutes in the second 
half. What could have been a 
dramatic upset in Crisler Center 
turned into a seven-point defeat 
as the Wolverines’ small guards 
were denied scoring chances 
when driving into the paint.

At this point in the season, 

though, it won’t get any easier. 
For Michigan to find success in 
the Big Ten, it must to protect its 
bigs and keep them in the game.

“Hallie’s biggest 
challenge right 
now is to gain 

that experience.”
