Brandon: Van Horn
'served the University
of Michigan well'
during her tenure
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily NewsEditor
Associate Athletic Director
Judy Van Horn is leaving her posi-
tion in the University's Athletic
Department and is taking a job as
a senior associate athletic direc-
tor for the University of South
Carolina, according to an internal
announcement on Friday.
Van Horn, the Athletic
Department's senior woman
administrator, directed the ath-
letics compliance department and
worked at the University for the
last nine years. During the past 14
months, Van Horn worked closely
with the NCAA on its investigation
of the Michigan football program.
In May, the University
announced self-imposed sanc-
tions, and Van Horn was one of
seven individuals who received
letters of reprimand and was held
responsible for the violations.
The NCAA completed its inves-
tigation earlier this month and
decided to place the University's

football program on a three-year
probation. As part of the penal-
ties, Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez must attend the 2011 NCAA
Regional Rules Seminar, and the
University has reduced the football
team's practice time by 130 hours.
Van Horn spoke before the
NCAA Committee on Infractions
in a hearing in August. While the
committee pointed out discrep-
ancies in reports from the foot-
ball program and the compliance
department, Van Horn was not
deemed to be at fault in the final
NCAA repott.
In a statement released Friday,
Athletic Director David Bran-
don wrote that Van Horn "served
the University of Michigan well"
during her time in the Athletic
Department.
"We wish Judy well in her new
career pursuit," he wrote.
In a separate statementfroi the
University of South Carolina, Van
Horn wrote that she is looking for-
ward to working with the school's
athletics department.
"This is a fabulous opportunity
for me and my family," Van Horn
wrote. "I am excited to be joining
an institution which holds its aca-
demic and athletics standards at
such a high level."
According to the statement, Van

Everything you thought to be

Michigan's offense: struggling.
The defense: playing well?-
Is it true, though? Can we
believe what we see when every-
thing is so out of the ordinary?
In the Twilight Zone, noth-
ing is quite as it seems. History
will show that Michigan won the

The rest is left up to your inter-

The first sign of abnormality
came when redshirt freshman

down to give the Wolverines a
7-0 lead.

After that, the Boilermakers
couldn't move the ball for the
majority of the game. Everyone
else had exploded for an average
of 34 points per game against
this Wolverine defense - Purdue
didn't score an offensive touch-
down.
Prior to its final drive, Purdue
had 79 yards passing. Michigan's
pass defense usually allowed that
many yards in less than a quar-
ter. Just five teams in Division-I
football had given up more yards

UNVERSITY DIVERSIT Y
Campus offers mixed view
of changes in enrollment

THE LAST LAP

Students, officials
say more could be
done to increase
minority enrollment
By SARA BOBOLTZ
Daily StaffReporter
With enrollment at the Uni-
versity's Ann Arbor campus at
an all-time high and an increase
in underrepresented minority

enrollment this year, students and
faculty members expressed mixed
reactions to the University's
changing demographics.
The University's Office of the
Registrar released figures last
month stating that undergradu-
ate enrollment increased by 3.1
percent and graduate enrollment
by 6.7 percent from last year, for a
total of 41,924 students on campus
this semester. Additionally, the
office of the Registrar reported a
1.5-percent increase in the enroll-
ment of underrepresented minor-

ity students at the University. This
spike could, however, be attribut-
ed in part to changes in the High-
er Education Opportunity Act
reporting guidelines that altered
the way data on student ethnicity
is collected.
Student leaders and officials
said though they are pleased with
the uptick in underrepresented
minority enrollment, more could
still be done to have minority stu-
dents enroll and stay at the Uni-
versity.

Though University students

Anti-gay act at Albion

Albion College President
Donna Randall publicly apolo-
gized this week for the actions
of students who burned a gay
pride flag on campus property
following the college's Coming
Out week last month, accord-
ing to an Albion College press
release issued on Nov. 10.
According to the statement,
Albion College staff respond-
ed to an anonymous report of
the incident on Oct. 19. The
investigation that followed
uncovered the burnt flag in
a trash can behind a campus
building.
Randall wrote in the release
that Albion "condemns the
harassment" of any student.
She added that campus author-
ities are investigating the
incident, and they have yet to
identify the students respon-
sible for burning the flag.

DUKE REPUBLICAN
FACES PORN CHARGES
Duke University senior Cliff
Satell, formervice chair of Duke's
chapter of College Republicans,
was charged with obtaining and
possessing child pornography,
according to a Nov. 11 article in
Duke University's campus news-
paper The Chronicle.
The article reported that an
April 2009 arrest found Satell
possessed digital videos of pre-
teen and teen boys engaging in
sexual acts. Satell is due in court
next month for five counts of
second-degree exploitation of a
minor and five counts of third-
degree exploitation of a minor.
In an e-mail to The Chroni-
cle, Satell wrote that he is still
planning on graduating in May
and the university will not be
taking disciplinary action.

CALIFORNIA STATE
UNIVERSITY INCREASES
TUITION 15.5 PERCENT
California State University
students can expect higher
tuition bills after the CSU
Board of Trustees voted to
increase tuition 15.5 percent
by fall 2011, according to a Nov.
10 article in The Huffington
Post.
The article reported that
the tuition increase for under-
graduate, graduate and cre-
dential programs is intended
to offset cuts in state funding
which caused a reduction in
staff and course offerings.
This will be the fourth
increase that the 23-campus
CSU has made since 2007 to
compensate for a decline in
state funding.

aughter charged
or stabbing parents
The 17-year-old daughter of
wo Michigan stabbing victims
nd two other teenagers were
'harged yesterday with multiple
urder counts in the small-town
ttack that killed the girl's father
nd seriously wounded her moth-
pr.
Tia Marie-Mitchell Skinner
nd Jonathan Kurtz and James
reston, both 18 and from Avoca,
were charged at the St. Clair
ounty Jail with open murder,
attempted murder and conspira-
y. The open murder charge gives
prosecutors the option to amend
it to first-degree murder.
Police said two intruders
in Halloween masks climbed
hrough a window Thursday night
and attacked Paul and Mara Skin-
ner in their Yale home as they lay
in bed. Tia Marie-Mitchell Skin-
ner, the couple's adopted daugh-
ter, was in the home along with a
visiting son in his 20s.
Police do not believe the son
was involved in the attack.

Ariz. voters legalize
medical marijuana
in close vote
By a narrow margin, Arizona
voters have given their OK to legal-
ized medical marijuana for people
with chronic or debilitating dis-
eases.
The decision makes Arizona
the 15th state to approve a medical
marijuana law. California was the
first in 1996, and 13 other states and
Washington, D.C., have followed
suit.
Proposition 203 won by just
4,341 votes out of more than 1.67
million ballots counted, according
to final tallies Saturday.
Approval came as somewhat of a
surprise after the measure started
out losing on Election Day by about
7,200 votes.
The gap gradually narrowed
until it surged ahead during Fri-
day's count by more than 4,000
votes. Saturday's final count was
841,346 in favor of the measure and
837,005 opposed.

FBI: M-an believed
dead arrested on
kidnapping charges
A man who was declared legal-
ly dead 16 years ago in Mississip-
pi was arrested yesterday in the
kidnapping of a slain Las Vegas
girl whose body was found in the
woods of central Louisiana, the
FBI said.
FBI spokeswoman Sheila
Thorne said Thomas Steven Sand-
ers was arrested early yesterday at
a truck stop in Gulfport, Miss. The
arrest capped a massive manhunt

in a bizarre case that stretched
across the country.
Court documents obtained
by The Associated Press show
Sanders abandoned his family in
1987 and was declared dead by a
Mississippi court 1994. He lived
unnoticed for years despite being
arrested several times.
Sanders, 53, was wanted in the
kidnapping 12-year-old Lexis Rob-
erts, whose skeleton was found
by hunters early last month. Her
31-year-old mother, Suellen Rob-
erts, is missing. Officials say she
is not a suspect in her daughter's
death - and they hope she has not
met with foul play.

A MISSION
Food Gatherers, the largest food bank in
Washtenaw County, is working to fight a
138-percent spike in demand

ENROLLMENT
From Page 1A
Nina Grant, director of Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs, said that
while University officials are
pleased with the number of under-
represented minority students who
are offered admission, they have
been working over the past year to
increase the number that accepts
admission.
In the past few years, even as
the number of underrepresented
minority students who accept offers
of admission has risen, the number
who actually enrolled has decreased
-a trend that has changed lhisyear.
As part of the effort to reverse
this, Grant said MESA met with
members of the office of the Pro-
vost, the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions and the Center for Edu-
cational Outreach each month dur-
ing the 2009-2010 academic year to
provide students with a way to "con-
nectto the recruitmentefforts."
When asked whether or not she
was pleased with the level of diver-
sity on campus, Grant commented
on the relative nature of the word.
Diversity, Granttsaid, "is like cold. If
Igrew up inFlorida and I'mhere, it's
freezing cold to me, but if I'm from
the Midwest this is a pretty good
day. So I think diversity is a rela-
tive term-it's basedon somebody's
experience and exposure."
Nonetheless, Grant stressed
her approval of the "strong com-
mitment" by students, faculty and
administrators to increasing diver-
sity. "It makes me proud to be part
of an institution that has that level of
commitment," she said.
Andrea Hernandez, a third-year
law student and co-chair of the Lati-
no Law Students Association, sug-
gested that to increase thenumberiof
accepted underrepresented minority
students who choose to enroll, the
University might consider offering
more application fee waivers, schol-
arships and financial aid.
"I don't doubt that everyone is
working hard," Hernandez said,
"but the bottom line is that minori-
ties are still in the minority, and we
still have a long way to go in achiev-
ing a more diverse student body."
LSA senior Samantha Martin,
the Black Student Union spokes-
person, echoed Hernandez's sen-
timents, saying she would like to
see more results from the Uni-
versity's efforts to attract under-
represented minority students.
Martin said that while numbers
have increased since last year, the
general trend over the past several
years has been a downward one.
Martin also discussed the need
for better efforts to retain under-
represented minority students once
they decide to enroll.
"I still see a lack of attention to
those students as they come in,
and a lack of active retention," she
said. "Many people I knew when I
came in aren't here now, and that's
a problem."
Martin suggested that retention
could be improved with a greater
effort to educate students about
racism on campus. She said many
courses that fulfill LSA's race and
ethnicity requirement do not ade-
quately address racism and cited
this as a possible contributing factor
to bias incidents.
LSA junior Alys Alley, co-chair of
the Native American Student Asso-
ciation, said NASA works hard to
recruit and retain American Indian
students at the University through

programs like Michigan Indian Stu-
dents Achieving Great Educations.
As part of the program, high
school seniors are invited to spend
a day with NASA members, who
take them around campus, explain
the financial aid process and offer
suggestions for writing application
essays.
Since Michigan voters passed a
ballot initiative in 2006 that banned
affirmative action, Alley said that
NASA has had a tough time attract-
ing students to the University.
"Proposal 2 really hindered the
University's abilityto recruit under-
representediminority students sowe
now have to get creative," she said.
in addition to an increase in
underrepresented minority stu-
dents, the University also had the
largest enrollment in its history
this year. Students, professors and
officials said they felt having more
students enrolled at the University
might harm the campus environ-
ment, particularly in terms of hous-
ing and one-on-one interaction
between students and faculty.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said the spike in enroll-
ment "isn't a planned increase in the
student population," according to a
September article in The Michigan
Daily.
"We've been working on trying
to shrink a little bit and some years
we've been more successful then
others in holding the line," Cole-
man said in the article. "I mean, I'm
thrilled that so manypeople wantto
come to the University of Michigan,
but we also have to be very cogni-
zant of the experience students get
and we want that to beaa good expe-
rience. "
Associate English Prof. Susan
Najita echoed Coleman's sentiments
saying she noticed an increased
demand in freshman English semi-
nars this semester, resulting in more
waitlisted students and more stu-
dents being turned away from sc-
tions.
If more students are to be
enrolled at the University, she said,
tuition money should be spent on
educational resources. But she said
she also approves of the increased
student body size because it serves
to "democratize access to educa-
tion."
"I'd be happy if they opened it
even further," she said.
Paul Kessenich, assistant pro-
fessor of mathematics, said he
and other faculty members in the
mathematics department have also
noticed an increase in demand for
courses, and suggested the increase
may be hurting the quality of stu-
dents' educations.
"Sometimes getting 25 people
to listen at the same time versus 32
people - it's just seven more people
- but it can be an issue, and it has
been for some of our instructors,"
Kessenich said.
LSA junior Lisa Blaskwski said
she supports the idea of reducing
enrollment.
"It reflects positively on the Uni-
versity if we have these high stan-
dards," she said:
Apurva Lingnurkar, a first-year
graduate student in chemical egi-
neering, said he also supports a
reduction in enrollment because it
puts undergraduates in larger aca-
demic programs at a disadvantage.
Lingnurkar said he wouldn't like
to see the University recruit too
many more students "because then
it becomes theArizona State model,
where you get as many students as

possible in order to make money."

assisting the organization.
Since 2006, the number of
the bank's food recipients has
increased 138 percent, and more
than 14,000 children receised
emergency food last year,
according to Schlitt. Facing that
increased demand, Food Gather-
ers is working to meet it.
Aunt Millie's, known for its logo
of a silhouette of a woman serving
a loaf of bread, donated and deliv-
ered 2,400 loaves of Butter Top
Wheat Bread Friday morning to
Food Gatherers.
At the warehouse on Friday,
Greg Fanslau, branch manager for
Aunt Millie's bakeries, said Aunt
Millie's was "very happy to give
the donation and help out in any
way possible."
In addition to businesses,
government programs like the
Michigan Agricultuiral Surplus
System - a partnership between
food banks, the state government
and farmers - donate to the food
bank. Last week, the MASS gave
thousands of apples to Food Gath-
erers.
Zingerman's i)elicatessen
founded Food Gatherers in 1998
to help feed hungry people in Ann

Arbor. 'Fhe warehouse was origi-
nally located in an abandoned
slaughterhouse but the large
amount of donations quickly filled
the building to capacity, Schlitt
said. In 1997, Food Gatherer's
expanded its services to all of
Washtenaw County.
Beyond the entrance of the
warehouse, sits an exotic display
of foods that includes canned rat-
tlesnake, buffalo, elk and alligator
as well as blueberry pizza topping,
octopus and squid. It's an "exotic
museum," Schlitt said, explaining
tha these donated foods aren't
given to the public.
In addition to the more bizarre
foods, the warehouse is full of
nonperishable foods, including
cans of chili, sweet corn, beans
and applesauce stacked out of eye-
sight.
Every year, nearly 5 million
pounds of food travel through the
warehouse doors and into hungry
mouths.
While a lot of the food is donat-
ed from the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture and Federal
Emergency Management Agency,
Food Gatherer's also purchases
food in bulk.
Though the USDA is one of
their largest donors, Schlitt said
donations were down this year,
which required the organization
to push for more local donations
and purchase more food to meet
the connrnnuity's needs.
According to Schlitt, Food
Gatherer's receives emergency
boxes of food from Washtenaw
County's Employment Trairning
& Community Services to give to
residents who have "hit rock bot-
torn" and dont "have any food in
the pantry."
One ETCS box contained pasta,
applesauce, milk, cheese, canned
meats, and more.
"Lots of stable foods." Schlitt

said. "Nutritious. Ready-to-eat."
'fwo rows of shelves remained
partly empty, and Schlitt said
they hope to fill the space with
donations from food drives Food
Gatherers will host with Kroger,
Busch's Fresh Food Market and
Whole Foods Market in the
upcoming weeks. According to
Schlitt, more than 15 Ocommunity
programs work with Food Gather-
erls.
Next to 25 trays stacked with
onions, workers sorted through
produce like squash, cauliflow-
er and organic bananas. A man
walked by pushing a cart of large
blue barrels given to local business-
es to display for food donations.
A large walk-in cooler contains
perishable goods like strawber-
ries, cheese and pre-packaged
meals from local businesses.
Schliti said Fiood Gatherers
has a 24-to 48-hour turnaround
period to empty and restock the
goods because of their short shelf
life and space constraints.
"We are basically at capacity,"
she said.
Toward the back of the ware-
house is a shopping pantry, like a
mini-market, where agencies are
given credits and are allowed to
purchase goods for people with
specialized diets - including veg-
etarian and gluten-free - that
they assist.
They can also purchase treats
for children, like bags of candy or
boxes of Razzle Blue Blitz Fruitby
the Foot.
While the sweets are popular,
Schlitt said the main mission is
to provide healthy food for the
needy.
"41ur belief right now is not only
to feed people but to feed people
nutritious foods," Schlitt said.
"We feel that investing in people's
health is a great investnent into
the community,"

Freshmen members
of Congress adapt to
new career and life
on Capitol Hill
WASHINGTON (AP)-- Where
to live? Whom to hire? What's a
voting cardard and where are the
bathrooms?
More than 100 nembers of
Congress arrive in Washington
this comingsweek for the first time
since winning election, trading
the loftiness of camrnpaign speech-
es for mundane lessons in how to
do their new jobs.
It's freshman orientation oin
Capitol Hill, and the larger-than-
usual class of 2010 is getting a
crash course oi how to navigate
the next two years.
Talk of changing the nation's
direction? That's oiln the back
burner for now. The newly elec ted
House members -85 Republi-
cans, a meager nine Democrats

_- need actual directions around
their new workplace. The Senate
is having its own orientation at
the same time.
Instead ofAmericanexception-
alism, his election night theine,
Rep.-elect Tim Scott, R-S.C., is
focused on Washington's excep-
tional rental prices.
"Nothing here is affordable,
is what I've learned," says Scott,
who migit share an apartment
with classmates.
Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill.,
told supporters in his victory
speech that lie would "stand
strong in the epic battle that we
have in front of us to take back
our country." But come today,
Kinzinger will be looking for a
one-bedroom apartment, setting
up an interview with a prospec-
tive chief of staff and figuring out
whether he wants to deal with a
commte or live within walkinng
distance of the Capitol.
Even before the freshmen learn
laNw making, theyll be figuring out
how to live with a new set ofrules,

cnstOmms and rituals. Here to help:
an array of congressional commit-
tes and veterans, and a constella-
tion of foundations and lobbyists.
The second-ranking Republi-
can, Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia,
had a 144-page book in the mail
to new members within hours of
Electioni Day. "Hit The Ground
Running" explains the nuts and
bolts of setting up a cnmgressio-
nal office, hiring staff, mnanaging
the office budget and being an
employer. It also offers some gen-
eral rules of the road.
"Do: G(et answers for any ethi-
cal questions you may have if you
are in doubt," according to the
manual, ai updated version of
one originally sent out by former
House Republican leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas.
"Don't: Completely disappear
from the public" between Elec-
tion Day and the new Congress.
"Even though you won't take
office until annuary, many of your
constitunts mwill view you as their
irebnimer of Congress."

High-rises, high prices
Students need more affordable housing options
a nn Arbor living appears to be one of the only things immune
to the economic downfall. The number of high-rise apart-
ments in Ann Arbor has been climbing in recent years. Lux-
ury apartments 4 Eleven Lofts and Zaragon Place are already in use
and the construction of Zaragon II is underway. Another high-rise
is slated to take the place of Village Corner and neighboring vacant
buildings by fall 2012. These buildings offer a central location and
many amenities. But this convenience often comes at a steep price.
Developers should cater to the desires and needs of students, all the
while making sure to keep pricing relatively affordable.

Time to cap-and-trade Finley

I I


After more than 40 years at the same
South University location, Village Corner
closed its doors on Nov. 6 to make room for
a new tenant, according to a Nov. 8 Daily
article. Owner Dick Sheer sold his lease
to real estate developer Ron Hughs, who
plans to transform the space into a new
student luxury high-rise by the fall of 2012.
The high-rise, called 601 Forest, will be
14 stories high and will feature an under-
ground parking lot, a fitness center and
landscaped terrace, according to a June
22 AnnArbor.com article. Construction
on another high-rise apartment building,
Zaragon 00 recently began on the corner
of E. William Street and Thompson Street.
Zaragon II will also reach 14 stories.
In theory, high-rises are the best way to
build. As a city's population grows, offi-
cials have two options: They can build up
or out. Because apartments expand verti-
cally rather than horizontally, they take up
less land and allow for more green space
then expanding the area of the city. Addi-
tionally, because of high-rises' central
location, residents often don't need acar to
drive to class. If students are driving less
often, they are helping to reduce the cam-
pus coninunity's carbon footprint.
But these high-rises, though more envi-
ronmentally friendly than the alternative

urban sprawl, aren't giving students what
they really need: affordability. In Ann
Arbor's housing market, many students
struggle to pay rent. Students need reason-
ably-priced housing close to campus, not
state-of-the-art electronics and applianc-
es that these luxury apartments provide.
Developers should focus on giving students
housing that everyone can afford.
Some of these new buildings offer stu-
dents progressive lease policies, which are
a great convenience for students who don't
remain in Ann Arbor year-round. When
dealing with off-campus housing, most stu-
dents are faced with one only option - a
12-month lease. Inflexible terrms force rent-
ers who can't live in the space year round to
find a suitable sub-letter - which is often a
difficult process - or to pay for space that
they're unable to use. In some luxury high-
rises, renters can sign a lease that suits their
specific needs. Traditional student housing
should follow this model and offer students
more reasonable leases.
The proliferation of high-rises in Ann
Arbor is certainly welcome. But "high-
rise" doesn't have to be a synonym for
"high price." There is a market for hous-
ing that falls in between overly luxurious
and rundown, outdated homes. We need a
middle ground.

hy oh why can't we have a
better press corps?
I stole that line from
economist and
blogger Brad
DeLong. But I was
so enraged after
reading Nolan Fin-
ley's utterly worth- -
less column in last
Thursday's edi- _
tion of The Detroit
News, DeLong's
lament in response PATRICK
to journalistic OMAHEN
incompetence was
the only reaction I
could muster.
Finley has a problem with the
Environmental Protection Agency's
plans to regulate carbon dioxide
emissions. He suggests that the EPA's
plans will bury coal plants under
unnecessary regulations, which will
then drive up consumer electric-
ity prices by at least 25 percent. He
claims to be baffled by the EPA's drive
to regulate CO2 because coal plants
have cut emissions by 80 percent over
the last 30 years.
Let's start with Finley's most dis-
ingenuous claim: that coal plants
have cut emissions by 80 percent over
the last three decades.
The problem is that Finley doesn't
specify which type of emissions. It's
true that coal-fired plants have dras-
tically reduced certain types of emis-
sions. According to current figures
from the EPA, power plants generate
about 73 percent of the sulfur dioxide
emitted in the U.S. S02 is harmful to
the human respiratory system and a
major ingredient in acid rain. Since
1980, total SO2 emissions have been
cut by 71 percent. Mercury emissions
and particulates have also declined
significantly.
But Finley's column isn't about
those pollutants - it's about carbon
dioxide. Those emissions have been
steadily rising over the past years,
increasing about 13 percent between
1990 and 2008. EPA statistics con-
sistently show that electrical power

plants - most of which are coal-fired
- account for the largest source of
C02 emissions in the U.S. - and their
share of total carbon emissions is
growing.
Why have sulfur dioxide levels
decreased while carbon dioxide lev-
els increased? It's because there are
strict national regulations limit-
ing sulfur dioxide output and none
regarding carbon dioxide - yet.
That's so simple I would think Finley
could get it into his head.
But Finley's sins extend beyond his
dishonest bait-and-switch on emis-
sions. He also displays ignorance
regarding different types of regulation.
For most of the column, he complains
about a scheme of regulation called
cap-and-trade, which he dismissively
refers to as "cap-and-tax." He also
complains about the pending EPA reg-
ulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
He seems to think that cap-and-trade
and the pending regulations are the
same thing. But they are actually quite
distinct animals.
Under the Clean Air Act of 1970, the
EPA has traditionally regulated most
pollutants under a scheme known as
"new-source review." Under this sys-
tem, existing sources of pollutants,
like an old coal-fired power plant,
are grandfathered into the system,
while new plants are subject to strict
review. The regulation has been used
with considerable success, but it's eco-
nomically inefficient and doesn't cut
pollution as much as it could. Instead
of building new cleaner plants, power
companies tend to let the old unregu-
lated ones wheeze on.
Cap-and-trade is considerably
more flexible. Instead of directly reg-
ulating each source of pollution, the
EPA sets an overall cap onthe amount
of a pollutant that can be emitted.
Then it either assigns or auctions off
permits for each ton of pollutants.
Businesses that end up emitting less
pollution than their number of per-
mits can sell them to companies who
pollute above their allottment. The
trading aspect is critical - it creates
a free market in carbon which maxi-

mizes pollution reduction while min
imizing economic costs.
Cap-and-trade has been used to
manage sulfur dioxide successfull
under the 1990 amendments to the
Clean Air Act. By 2007, the program
exceeded its reduction targets and
has allowed the United States east of
the Mississippi River to start recov-
ering from the affects of acid rain.
And the program only cost 25 percent
as much as the EPA estimated, while
electricity prices remained constant
between 1995 and 2007. So much for
Finley's insinuation that regulation
jacks up power rates.
Detroit News
writer should have
done his research.
Finley claims that we're "losing
the fight" against cap and trade -
but a national cap-and-trade plan
died in the Senate in August. What
Finley is actually railing against are
less effective direct regulations. Cap-
and-trade would have been more
effective from both an environmental
and an economic standpoint - but it
was blocked by the same Republicans
who Finley exhorts as champions of
common-sense policies.
Finley may be an experienced col-
umnist, but this time he makes some
major errors that could have been
remedied by a few hours of research
into the mechanism of how environ-
mental regulati*on really works. Read-
ers rely on the news to provide them
with accurate information about pub-
lic policy. When Finley misinterprets
simple facts, he fails to do his job. He's
certainlyentitled tohisownopinionon
environmental regulations, buthe's not
entitled to his own facts.

I'm frorn New York, but the Wolverines have
always been a part of my family. I watched
osany football games growing up and managed
to get to the 1998 Rose Bowl with my grandma
and grandpa, who are both University alumni,
to see Michigan beat Washington State.
I'm sharing my personal history to qualify the
difficulty that I face in urging football fans to
stop supporting the sport. No other game com-
bines physical ability and strategy like football,
but along with the excitement comes the injuries
- and we can't ignore the injuries any longer.
Te prevalence of brain damage in foot-
ball players is becoming more acknowledged.
In a 2009 study, the University's Institute for
Social Research reported on the incidence of
injuries among football players. It found that
memory problems (i.e., dementia, Alzheimer's
disease or other memory-related diseases)
were 19 times more prevalent among NFL play-
ers betsween the ages of 30 and 49 than all U.S.
men in the same age range. Similarly, in men
aged .0s and older, the study found that mem-
ory problems were three times greater in NFL
players than the average U.S man.
it seened for a little while that changes to
tackling rules and additional penalties for
illegal hits could help prevent brain injuries
assong college and NFL players. The real-
ity we're seeing is that even after safety mea-
sures are put in place, football continues to be
dangerous. Indianapolis Colts wide receiver
Austin Collie suffered one of the most recent
injuries. He was rendered unconscious after
an Eagle's safety collided with the back of his
head. Additionally, according to the Detroit
Free Press, our very own Denard Robinson had
to leave this year's game against Illinois game
because ie was experiencing headaches and
dizziness due to an unknown injury.
Robissson's symptoms weren't even the
result of a heavy or egregious hit. Michigan
coach Itich Rodriguez told the Free Press that
neither Robinson nor Rodriguez were aware of
the specific hit that caused Robinson's disori-
entation, which brings up an issue that compli-
cates the matter of head injuries even further.
COtsCUssiosns and head injuries aren't always
the result of a big hit. A high frequency of small

injuries can lead to concussions. In an Oct. 19
article in The New Yorker, Malcolm Gladwell
interviewed the head of the Sports Concussion
Research Program at the University of North
Carolina. The research program produced
results that showed that cumulative exposure
to contact with the head can also lead to con-
cussions. Thus, the minor changes to rules -
like penalties for helmet-to-helmet collisions
- fail to remove the danger of injury.
Coming to terms with injuries that result
from football provides the fans with two
courses of action: force football to change or
continue to support a dangerous sport. Part of
a free society is allowing people to participate
in activities that are bad for them. That doesn't
mean, however, that we have to endorse these
activities. Smoking cigarettes is legal, but that
doesn't mean we should support it. Ultimate
Fighting Championship is legal and it should
be, but that doesn't mean we should support it.
The question is whether football will change or
remain an abusive sport. If it doesn't change,
fans will have to come to terms with the fact
that they're supporting an activity that is det-
rimental to the people they cheer for.
The other option for football fans is to
decrease support until the sport becomes less
dangerous. Football is a business. And like any
business, if its activities are pulling in a lot of
money, it will continue those activities. The
only thing that can get football to change is a
statement by the consumers of the sport.
We can't leave it up to the football indus-
try to protect our classmates and professional
players. We, the football fans, are the driving
force that supports a dangerous environment
for athletes. We need to force the sport to
change and the only way to do this is to remove
our support, especially our financial contri-
butions. We need to act on our disapproval of
football's preponderance of injuries. We need
to write letters to NFL commissioner Roger
Goodell, University Athletic Director David
Brandon and University President Mary Sue
Coleman. Most importantly, we need to stop
buying tickets to games.

have taken at least
60 exams during
my time here. Putting it this way, my

I passionately dislike them.

strong enough to make the clock stop
for a moment, to warp the space-time

begin to emerge, like comic book
vignettes, their combined narrative
distinctly disjointed. I begin to realize
that there isn't a single lesson or theme
that encompasses my past experience.
In the words of Italian author Cesare
Pavese, "We do not remember days; we
remember moments."
ETERNAL DAMNATION
A few weeks ago, I took the time to
observe the religious extremists that
gather at the corner of State Street and
North University Avenue on football
Saturdays as they listed the reasons

why everyone was doomed to eternal
damnation unless they changed their
ways. The group is composed of four
or five individuals who rotate between
handing out flie-s and screaming their
diatribe. Passersby have learned to
ignore the crazy old men,butoccasion-
ally someone momentarily stops and
observes them, as if staring at gorillas
delousing each other at the zoo.
Something catches my eye - a sign
that one of the men is holding, which
claims that "whisperers" are among
the sinners doomed to receive God's
wrath. Suddenly, my mind is trans-
ported to my childhood. My mom
used to tell me to be respectfully
quiet and to whisper when we went
to the movie theater. In hindsight,
I should have retorted by shouting,
"But I will face eternal damnation if
I do as you say, mommy!"
Amused by this image, I return
to reading the sign. "Well, I'll be
damned!" I exclaim, the irony of the
statement blowing completely over
my head. "Disobeyers of parents,"
apparently, are also doomed to eter-
nal damnation.
THE YOUNG PROFESSOR
Flashing back six months, I find
myself in an economics class at 10 in
the morning. This wasn't the class I
had wanted to take - my preferred
class had been cancelled due to a pro-
fessor's illness.
Then the professor enters. I'm
immediately captivated by his audac-
ity and energy. I also notice that he's
visibly nervous - has he not taught a
class before? It wouldn't be surprising,
given his apparentyouth.
A month later, I'm convinced that
this class is the best I've taken. I feel
bombarded with knowledge and new
insights, courtesy of the young profes-
sor's unyielding wit and humor.
Two weeks before the conclusion
of class, a friend of mine remarks that
theprofessorlooks unwell. Indeed, the
professor is sweating profusely and

his humor is increasingly infrequent.
Then, one day, the young professor
interrupts his lecture to show us pic-
tures of his young children. The pause
is brief and I make nothing of it.
The experiences
that have defined
my time at the'U.'
The day of the exam, the young
professor doesn't show up to class.
My classmates and I are intensely
worried. Two weeks later, I receive an
e-mail from the professor, thanking
everyone in the class and apologizing
for runningoutof energy towards the
end of the semester. "Thankfully, he's
recovered," I conclude.
Then, one seemingly random sum-
mer day, Ireceive an e-mail. It's direct-
ed to all students in the economics
class I had taken with the young pro-
fessor. "Sad news," the e-mail reads.
For a whole week, I cannot shake
away my sense of loss. I now realize
that, outside of my grandmother's and
grandfather's deaths when I was very
young, I had never experienced the
death of someone close. Now that Ican
rationalize it, I come to the conclusion
that, in this case, rationality does noth-
ing but make the experience worse.
WAKINGUP
A gust of wind blows through the
window and my daydreams come
to an abrupt end. I ask myself why I
always seem to recall the sad memo-
ries first. Given that my years at the
University have been the happiest of
my life, I decide it's only fair to also
revisit the happier moments.

Dear takes the stage at Ghostly anniversary

Electronica singer-songwriter Matthew Dear returns to
hometown for a concert and some Zingerman's
By Kristyn Acho I Daily Music Editor

What began in a University dorm room has morphed
into Ann Arbor's oremiere record label

"Last time we were (in Ann
Arbor) we went to Zingerman's for
lunch and then we went to Road-
house for dinner and then Zing-
erman's for lunch the next day,
so we've got Grizzly Bear beat on
that one - you better write that,"
Matthew Dear said in an interview
with the Daily.
It's no secret that when famous
acts like Grizzly Bear roll into Ann
Arbor, they often drop in on the
A2 mainstay. But for a University
alum like Matthew Dear, a quirky
spot like Zingerman's means more
than mammoth-sized sandwiches
and small-town charm. For Dear,
it's synonymous with the city of
Ann Arbor itself, the place where
the techno talent and indie cross-
over laid the foundations for his
career.
While attending the University,
Dear met Sam Valenti at a party.
After becoming fast friends over
an affinity for electro beats, the
two decided to create the now-
thriving Ann Arbor record label
Ghostly International. From
there, Dear started DJing at par-
ties and eventually moved into
production.
But according to Dear, he and
Valenti never expected the type
of success they revel in today.
For them, their accomplishments
serve as a simple reminder of how
far they have come.
"Sam and I have been at the
club before, and we hear a record
of ours playing and it feels really
good," he said.
"When we got into this we were
like 19 or 20," he added, "so to hear
stuff like that is really cool."
Dear is currently situated in
Brooklyn, N.Y. And though Ann
Arbor is starting to look like the
Brooklyn of the Midwest these
days, Dear is still nostalgic for his
Ann Arbor roots.
"Brooklyn has a lot of Ann
Arbor-esque characteristics com-
pared to Manhattan, but it's a bit
more in-your-face. Ann Arbor is
essentially a lot more laid back,"
Dear said.
The often-insufferable strain of
living in New York proved to be
inspiration for his latest endear-
ingly dark album, Black City.
"I think I get influenced by the
pressure of living in New York and
making music in that kind of envi-
ronment," Dear explained. "I usu-
ally sit down and turn on all the
machines and computers and start
making noise and see what hap-
pens. I don't really like to precon-

"A long time ago in a dorm room
in Couzens Hall on the hill, I had
the idea to start a record label," said
Sam Valenti, the founder of Ghostly
International, during a TEDxUofM
presentation last April.
Much to the benefit of Valenti's
dorm room dream, he met Mat-
thew Dear, who would help bring
Ghostly from concept to real-
ity. The two began working with a
local DJ called Disco D, and their
collaboration resulted in Ghostly's
first release, a 12-inch single called
"Hands Up For Detroit," in 1999.
Valenti wrote in an e-mail inter-
view with the Daily that he and
Dear were still undergraduates in
their dorm rooms, and the record-

ing process was as erratic as would
be expected, requiring several dif-
ferent kinds of equipment in vari-
ous locations.
After that 1999 release, Ghostly
continued to expand. Tadd Mulli-
nix, who makes music under many
different aliases including Dabrye,
was one of the next artists to join
up with the group. There wasn't
a specific direction in which the
label was headed and Mullinix
helped cultivate the wide breadth
of music that Ghostly would even-
tually be known for. He was ini-
tially approached by Valenti for
house music, and responding to the
request, Mullinix gave him demos
of his house music as well as other
styles he had been experimenting
with.
"I'm not sure if (Valenti) had a
strict plan for how the label should
sound," Mullinix told the Daily.
"And after that point, when he
came back to me, he said,'I want to
sign these other styles.' And that's
where the label branched out to be
sort of a multi-genre label."
Valenti's senior art project at the
University was "Disco Noveau," a
compilation album of electronic
musicians that was orchestrated in
part by Mullinix. This, accompa-
nied by Mullinix's and Osborne's
solo work, fully established Ghostly
as a major player in the electronic
music scene. As the Ghostly crew
left the University, instead of relo-
cating to a big metropolitan area, it
set up shop as close to home as pos-
sible, here in Ann Arbor.
The expansion of Ghostly has
been substantial, but not with-
out careful consideration. Jeremy
Peters, Ghostly's Licensing Man-
ager, spoke with the Daily about
the label's growth in response to its
success.

"There have been opportunities
for us to follow a trend," he said.
"We have sort of shied away from
that in order to grow more steadily
and more organically."
With a changing marketplace,
Ghostly has not only remained con-
stant with its loyalty to its home
town, but also with its relationship
with its artists.
"(Valenti) has been consistent
in terms of what he likes to do
with me. He's very open minded
and listens to my ideas," Mullinix
said. "The way that (Ghostly) has
changed is that I've been able to
see (Valenti) execute his vision and
fine tune what he wants Ghostly to
do and how it responds to things
like the digital market."
There is a relationship between
Ghostly and its artists that provides
a lot of freedom, and it can be heard
in the variety of styles explored.
As the label grows, Ghostly does
not intend to sacrifice its initial
goals and foundations for short-
term success.
"We try to keep the roster small
so we can really focus on each
release," Valenti wrote. "It's a new
era where the label is more of a
partner with the artist, less of a
parent."
Ghostly's success has led to the
opening of offices in Los Angeles
and New York, but its heart still
remains in its home town.
"Ann Arbor has been a part of
Ghostly for over 11 years now,"
Valenti wrote. "There are new stu-
dents coming (to the University)
every year, who I think would love
what we and our artists are about.
A lot of Ghostly started as late
night library sessions, coffee shops
and spending time at the record
stores. It's been a perfect place to
grow in."

ceive my songwriting ideas. I don't
sit down with ideas I came up with
on the guitar or anything."
While Dear used to use his
acoustic guitar to aid his songwrit-
ing, the instrument now serves
another purpose.
"I used to when I was younger,
but I don't do that anymore. I still
like the guitar but that's something
different. I think I just do that for
more kind of meditative therapy,
like sitting on the couch and hug-
ging my wife."
This year's Black City has more
of a brooding, haunting quality
than previous records like 2003's
Asa Breed. And whether or not this
mood shift was Dear's intent, it is
definitely apparent on his latest
album.
"I think it's reflective of the
mood shift I was talking about,"
he said. "Going to New York and
being a bit more inundated with
humanity and surrounded by a
lot more stressors in life, but in a
good way. I think it kind of influ-
enced me to make music differ-
ently."
One of the most striking quali-

ties of Black City is the stark
juxtaposition of themes of love
(sentimental soul spilling on
"Gem") and overt sexuality (lusty
double-entendres on "You Put a
Smell on Me"). .
"All of my music is going to have
those two opposing themes. I don't
know. I think I am a pretty sexu-
ally charged human being, but I
am also love-charged as well. Even
my electronic techno stuff had
the blending of those two," Dear
explained. "But again, Asa Breed
was a bit more laid back, being Ann
Arbor material, and Brooklyn's
Black City is a bit edgier. So that's
how the darker side of love made
its way onto the record."
Dear's avant-garde pop hasbeen
compared to the likes of Talking
Heads and David Bowie. But Dear
doesn't necessarily see himself in
that way.
"I find myself influenced by a lot
of things that influenced them in
terms of music. Especially on this
record, groups like Cluster and
weird '70s stuff that made its way
into Bowie's sound (influenced

Inside' economic disaster

by a complete economic melt-

mad as hell. As

altering crisis,
we need someone Stay
to blame, and just
saying"Bush did it" isn't gonna cut
it anymore. Who can we turn to in
the dead of night to direct our rage
- to throw out terms like "deriva-
tives" and "credit default swap" in
authoritative Helvetica, to show
us what happens when Hollywood
sticks it to the man?
Never fear, citizens. Director
Charles Ferguson is on the case
with "Inside Job," the latest prod-
uct of the "Here's where we went
wrong" documentary subgenre
(which enjoys a boom whenever
the rest of the world screws the
pooch). Ferguson, who previously
helmed the Iraq War doc "No End
in Sight," rakes some muck right
onto the doorstep of the finance
industry for its supremely unethi-
cal lending practices, which had
grown more and more unchecked
since Ronald Reagan deregulated
the banks during his presidency.
From the perspective of some-
one who's not in the Ross School
of Business and doesn't neces-

phrases, here's the movie's case, in

Denzel chugs along in 'Unstoppable'

Fast pacing and good
chemistry keep train
thriller from derailing
ByANKUR SOHONI
Daily Arts Writer
Check up on the details of "Unstoppa-
ble" and you'll see a strange trend: in two
consecutive years, director Tony Scott has
released two train-based Denzel Wash-
ington thrillers, the
first being "The Tak-
ing of Pelham1 2 3" last
June. Unstoppable
Both films place
Washington in the role At Quality16
of a cynical old-timer and Rave
wronged by "the Man" 20th Century Fox
and the only one with
the power to save the day - a personal-
ity that, through films like "Inside Man"
and "American Gangster," he has come
to inherit quite comfortably. In these
two recent films, Scott has placed him in
contrast with another leading male; in
"Pelham" it was John Travolta's turn as a
hijacking terrorist and in "Unstoppable"
it's Chris Pine ("Star Trek") as a proud
young train operator with family issues
and a heart of gold.
Dual star power is always a lucra-
tive way to generate mass appeal, and
"Unstoppable" cashes in on it by offering
valuable interplay between two actors

who have a somewhat unlikely but still train yard leader and Ethan Suplee (TV's
largely successful chemistry. Washing- "My Name is Earl") as the mistake-prone
ton plays Frank, assigned to engineer on operator and the catalytic screw-up, fits

southern Pennsylvania station unmanned
at full power. The train threatens to derail
in a heavily populated area if it maintains
its speed; our heroes decide to chase the
train down and attempt to bring it under
control.
Once the train is off and running, the
film moves at breakneck pace with lively
editing and handheld camera adding to
the chaos. Tony Scott, like older brother
Ridley, has auteurist visual style. That
said, he forgoes the crowded, flashy direc-
tion of his earlier films "Domino" and
"Man on Fire" for a more grounded but
still distinctive tone.
"Unstoppable" is stripped down and
presented almost entirely in real-time.
The runaway train is a formidable vil-
lain, and its mysterious, almost mysti-
cal quality is one of the film's strongest
points. Carrying large amounts of toxic
chemicals, it is never fully explained
how serious its damage would be, but the
realistic in-the-moment presentation is
thrilling.
The ensemble cast, which includes
Rosario Dawson ("Seven Pounds") as the "Wheeeeeeeee

We learn early on that Will and his
wife aren't speaking; later we learn that
it came as a result of a misunderstanding
and altercation involving another man.
We never learn more about what drives
him. We don't know why he is the way he
is.
The script is slow to start - perhaps
intentionally - and it weighs down Scott's
direction until the action picks up. The act

structure is off-balance, and despite the
intense production, the climax doesn't
fully satisfy.
Narratively, "Unstoppable" strives for
realism by presenting its crisis from every
different angle and centering itself on
working-class-hero protagonists. How-
ever, by never tying off its loose ends and
organizing its plot, it falls short of leaving
a lasting effect.

onan still bitter in
first week on cable TV

Former NBC host
debuts on TBS with
a spring in his step
ByLINDSAY HURD
DailyArts Writer
The long-awaited return of
Conan O'Brien has come, allowing
us all to discover he's pretty much
the same dude he's always been.
hether that's a
good or bad thing
is hard to tell.
The pre-
miere episode
of "Conan" on Weeknights
TBS, which aired at11 p.m.
last Monday, TBS
focused strongly
on his boot from
NBC. In fact, just about every joke
stemmed from O'Brien and NBC
parting ways last January after he
refusedto move into the midnight
slot. Clearly, he's still a little bit-
ter about losing his dream job and
spares no expense to get a few jokes
out of it.
His opening monologue was full
of sharp-tongued one-liners, say-
ing of the new show's name that
he "did it so I'd be a lot harder to

replace." Even Ricky Gervais made
an appearance, wishing O'Brien
luck on this show as well as all of
the other "new shows" O'Brien will
be hosting this year when endeavor
after endeavor fails for him. Those
looking for a big departure from the
standard bitter one-liners from the
past several months will be greatly
disappointed.
The move to TBS has resulted
in a much lower budget than what
O'Brien became accustomed to,
and he won't let viewers forget
that. Instead of his old set at 30
Rockefeller Plaza, O'Brien's new-
est digs consist of a mock seascape,
which toes the line between cool
and tacky. A giant moon wobbles
constantly behind his desk, making
for a few good laughs. When ran-
dom backstage noises interrupted
his interview with "Glee" star Lea
Michele, O'Brien quipped, "Basic
cable. There's a Meineke Muffler
Shop right behind us."
While some things may have
changed, the fundamental way the
man runs a late-night talk show has
not. His longtime sidekick, Andy
Richter, made the leap to TBS as
well, chiming in with comments
from his lectern and the couch. One
of his famous characters, the Mas-
turbating Bear, made an appear-

ance, as well as The Basic Cable
Band, Conan's new house band.
O'Brien's humor is self-deprecating
as ever, and he's not afraid to play
off of it, especially with his recent
pay cut. Itseems that O'Brien really
is down for anything - on Tuesday
he gave away a lock of his beard,
which is something we would pre-
sumably never see from Jay
Leno, NBC or any of the net-
works. O'Brien clearly likes
to have a good time, and now
has more freedom to do so.
Another thing O'Brien has
going for him? His overload of
celebrity friends is more than
happy to visit his new cable
crib. in his first week alone

he had Lea Michele, Seth Rogen,
Jack White, Tom Hanks, Julie
Bowen and Michael Cera.
Only time will tell whether
"Conan" will remain successful -
it was first in the ratings this past
week in the advertiser-coveted
18-49 demographic - but let's just
hope he doesn't stay stuck in the
stereotypical talk show
mold. Since "Conan" is
on cable, he has a heck
of a lot more room to be
funny. Let's just hope
he uses it.

The theme of wishful thinking and

anything at all.
Windblown reverb dances
around blurry, dark synthetic
sounds on tracks like "I Wish
We'd Never Met" and "Crack In
The Paint." Somber sways of vocal
harmonies coalesce with a bluesy
bass line on the latter, which cre-
ates the album's darkest sound.
This portion of the album taps into
a duskier psyche but is then pulled

out of its slump with the poppy
"All Day" and later, the cutesy,
Zooey Deschanel-esque "Oh My
Love."
WYWH is The Concretes' best
album to date. It's coherent and
flows magically from one song
to the next. If switching up their
sound is what it takes to create a
great album, then let the genre
bending continue.

The Whomping Willow in its golden years.




A 'Friggin' Jersey bore

ByLINDSAY HURD
Daily Arts Writer
When the biggest personality
on a show is some dude from New
Jersey trying to start a business
called "John-
ny Meatballs," '%
the point of
desperation My Big Friggin'
has clearly Weding
been reached.
VH1's lat- Mondays at 9 p.m.
est reality VH1
programming
endeavor follows five couples on
the verge of their wedding night.
We follow them as they fight,
whine, nag and completely disagree
about every single aspect of their
weddings, families and lives in gen-
eral. This show is literally "Jersey
Shore" meets "Bridezillas," but not
in a good way. Everything we hated
about both of these shows, from
whiny girls to trashy guys, is ampli-
fied by five in order to make this one
seem "original."
The network picked not one, but
five of the most obnoxious couples
ever to be the "stars" on "My Big
Friggin' Wedding." Couple one,
Johnny and Megin, are pregnant
and broke because Johnny doesn't
work. Instead, he hopes to get
"Johnny Meatballs" off the ground
by designing lackluster t-shirts for
hours on end when he should be
looking for a real job. Couple two
is Tyler and Aylssa, embarrassingly
sloppy drunks who make unnerv-

ing sexual comments in front
of their two-year-old daughter.
Couple three is Joey and Sandra,
whose biggest means of prepara-
tion for the wedding is to go tan-
ning, over and over again. Tammie
and Danny, the fourth couple, seem
the most "normal" until Tammie
opens her mouth - she literally
doesn't stop talking about herself
the entire time she is on the show.
Finally, Matt and Amanda are the
pair with the wacko Italian moth-
er-in-law who can't keep her nose
out of everyone's business. These
self-proclaimed "awesome" couples
are the lovely people we get to fol-
low for an entire season of wedding
planning bliss - lucky us.
While it can be slightly amusing
to watch people bitch each other
out, the biggest issue with "My
Big Friggin' Wedding" is that it's
all-too-clearly riding on the suc-
cess of TV's "Jersey" obsession. It
doesn't try to present anything new
or interesting about New Jersey,
but rather takes the pre-existing
stereotypes and tries way too hard
to find people who match them.
Excessive tanning, binge drinking
and screaming girls - all stereo-
types taken from "Jersey Shore"
- are the fuel that makes this wed-
ding show run.
What's worse is the question of
why the couples would ever want
to be on this show in the first place.
VH1 constantly mocks them with
cheesy graphics and commentary
that's clearly directed toward a

trashy Jersey mentality. The pro-
ducers edit the show to make every-
one look like a dumbass by having
the star say one thing and then do
the opposite. Alyssa claims she is
the best parent in the world, then
spends all her screen time in the
pilot showcasing her ability to get
wasted quickly. Everything from
the couples' lifestyles to their taste
in clothing and music are dragged
through the ringer while they
clamor for their five minutes of
fame.
An imperfect
marriage of
stereotypes and
.A-
stupidity.
The only upside to watching
"My Big Friggin' Wedding" is that
it makes you feel a whole lot better
about your own life. If you're not
about to marry a dude whose big-
gest aspiration is to have your wed-
ding be an "Italian Guido Club,"
then clearly you're headed in a
much better direction than anyone
on "My Big Friggin' Wedding". If
you're absolutely devastated that
"Jersey Shore" just ended, it might
be good for you to watch something
less ridiculous and offensive for a
change.

me). I don't like to think that I
am influenced by what they have
done directly, but I love their
music. I am a big fan of Talking
Heads," Dear said.
Most of Dear's inspiration
comes from male solo artists who
produce their own music, like
Peter Garbriel and Brian Eno, he
said.
"It would be really fun to col-
laborate with Brian Eno, I am
totally inspired by him and all of
his work as a producer, a solo art-
ist and a band member. So yeah,
that would be absolutely amaz-
ing," Dear said.
But for now, Dear couldn't be
more excited to hit the road and
perform live.
"I just love performing and
freaking out ... I think it's the
most fun in the moments where
it kind of all goes crazy and
everyone zones out in their
own world but comes together
as a collective band at the same
time," he said.
Sure performing has its perks,
but Dear's excitement over
returning to Ann Arbor and his
favorite delicatessen was unpar-
alleled.
"We're excited to come back,
we always have a great time in
Ann Arbor and I can't wait to get
a number 73 - that's my favor-
ite sandwich, with a pickle. And
if you don't want a lot of meat
you should go with the small
size because large is just way to
much. Oh, and tomato soup, got
to get the tomato soup."

day.
Sophomore quarterback
Denard Robinson, who usually
steals the show, did very little
and the Wolverines' offense
struggled to score. Robinson
turned the ball over four times,
and Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez decided to rotate the for-
mer Heisman frontrunner with
backup quarterback Tate Forcier.
That's what this game was com-
ing to.
Adding to your confusion,
Rodriguez said that his defense
tackled well, and redshirt junior
defensive end Ryan Van Bergen
said they were "assignment-
sound for the first time in a long
time." That doesn't sound like
the Wolverines you knew.
And Michigan did this without
two of its best defensive play-
ers: nose guard Mike Martin
and linebacker Jonas Mouton,
who weren't on the field due to
injuries.
There's no question that the
Wolverines' defense won the
game on Saturday. And who
would've thought those words
would have been uttered this
season?
Michigan can take some com-

fort in the fact that its defense
played well, forced five turn-
overs and scored a touchdown to
dominate the game. Its second-
ary that starts three freshmen
might be able to even gain some
confidence.
Don't get ahead of yourself
now though - not everything is
as it seems in the Twilight Zone.
This performance doesn't prove
much, other than that Michigan's
defense took a small step in the
right direction.
Purdue's lack of offensive
talent combined with the poor
weather resulted in some ugly
offense. If it wasn't for Purdue
quarterback Rob Henry, I don't
know if the Boilermakers would
have had a first down. Their
offense looked like Michigan's
circa 2008, when Steven Threet
and Nick Sheridan were rotating
at quarterback for the Wolver-
ines. Third-stringer Sean Rob-
inson split time at quarterback
with Henry, but he has averaged
a meager 3.2 yards per pass
attempt this season.
This had more to do with Pur-
due's ineptness than an amazing
turnaround on the part of the
Michigan defense. It's will take
an improvement on this week-
end's game to convince me that
this was more than an illusion.
Continue to tackle well and, as

CENSUS
From Page 1A
associate at the University's Popu-
lation Studies Center, wrote in an
e-mail interview that the response
rates can be misleading and should
be evaluated within the context of
previous census results.
"The student neighborhoods
continued to lag behind the city
of Ann Arbor, but there was
improvement over 2000," Neidert
wrote. "The student neighbor-
hoods improved, whereas Ann
Arbor, Washtenaw County, (the)
state of-Michigan (and the) U.S. all
remained at their 2000 participa-
tion rates."
The state of Michigan main-
tained its 77 percent participation
rate from 2000, Washtenaw Coun-
ty participation remained at 79
percent and the city of Ann Arbor
remained at 78 percent.
Neidert explained that over-
all census participation has been
decreasing over time, and the fact
that the University increased its
response rate from the 2000 Cen-
sus is somethingto be proud of.
"The (U.S.) Census Bureau was
very happy with (national and
state responses) 'staying the same,'
" Neidert wrote. "The fact that stu-
dent areas improved is a big plus."
According to Neidert, the Uni-
versity was divided into six cen-
sus tracts, or neighborhoods. Out
of the six, only the North Campus
tract decreased in participation -
from 70 percent in 2000 to 59 per-
cent this year.
Neidert wrote that the large
number of international students
living on North Campus may
be one reason for the disparity
between overall campus participa-
tion and North Campus participa-
tion.
"It is quite likely that this com-
munity was not aware that they
should be filling out census forms
even though they are just living in
Ann Arbor temporarily," Neidert
wrote.
Neidert also explained that the
numbers for the other campus
tracts can be misleading because
students in residence halls did not
receive census forms in the mail
like students living in houses and
apartments.
Instead, students living in resi-
dence halls filled out group quar-
ter forms, which are not included
in participation rate statistics. This
may be one factor that contributed
to the lower response rates on cam-
pus because the percentages don't
include the majority of University
students who submitted forms.
However, Neidert wrote, the
fact that census participation. is

significantly lower among student
compared to the national averagc
cannot be disregarded.
"In general, college student.
have low participation rates with
the census," Neidert wrote. "Thi
is mostly because students do noi
understand that they are respon
sible for filling out their census
forms unless they are living with
their parents and commuting to
UM on a daily basis."
She added that student censuq
participation is necessary because
a lack of responses can be detri-
mental to the University since th
census count is associated with the
distribution of federal funds.
However, Neidert wrote that
University participation was good
compared to other Big Ten schools.
"I was not disappointed with
the UM showing," she wrote. "It
was better than in the past...We
ended up beating Ohio State and
MSU."
Neidert added that the Census
Bureau knew that getting students
to participate would require extra
effort.
"The Census Bureau defined
college students as a hard-to-count
community and prepared mate-
rials to reach students," Neidert
wrote. "They did not do that in the
past."
On campus, University officials
encouraged students to fill out
forms by sponsoring a YouTube
contest that let students make vid-
eos promoting census participa-
tion.
While the Census Bureau also
tried to maximize response rates
by distributing informational
materials to campus communi-
ties, Neidert wrote that the bureau
could improve its strategies. One
way to do this would be to reach
out to the University community
earlier by working with the admin-
istration and student leaders on
campus.
Robert Groves, a former Univer-
sity professor and the director of
the U.S. Census Bureau, has two
sons in college and addressed the
issue of lower participation rates
among students in a 2010 Census
blog post published last December.
While only one census report
is required per household, Groves
wrote that college students "don't
think of themselves as a 'house-
hold."'
"There is no one roommate who
takes on the role of the head of
household," he wrote. "The room-
mates come and go on their own,
rarely eating together, mainly
gathering together on the week-
ends to watch TV sports. They
leave the small amount of mail
they get in their box for several
days before gathering it up."

First-ever
conference
title for 'M'
men's soccer
By JOHN EPPLER
For the Daily
STATE COLLEGE - The Michigan men's soccer
team won the Big Ten Tournament for the first time
in the program's 11-year histo-
ry yesterday, defeating Penn MICHIGAN 4
State by a record-settingscore PENN STATE 1
of 4-1 on the Nitanny Lions'
home field.
The win ensures a berth to the NCAA Tournament.
Michigan came out willing to settle for nothing
less than a convincing win. In the early minutes, the
Wolverines (14-4-3) won every 50-50-ball. The hustle
quickly paid off in the fourth minute of play when Nit-
tany Lion goalkeeper Brendan Birmingham misplayed
a long ball. Freshman forward Soony Saad - the
nations leading scorer - was there to put the ball in
the back of the net.
After missing part of the quarterfinal match and the
semifinal match due to a red card, senior forward Jus-
tin Meram netted two first-half goals, both of which
were created by long individual dribbles. The Penn
State defense simply had no response to his speed.
"Being rested was actually very good for me since
my knee was hurt," Meram said after the game. "I
knew I had to come out for the team."
But the action was far from over once Michigan
took a commanding three-goal lead.
Penn State (13-7-1) sent more men forward, but
Michigan continued attacking, as both teams refused
to back down.
"We have learned that we are the kind of team that
needs to keep moving forward," Michigan coach Steve
Burns said. "If we stop pressuring, we kind of lose our
mojo."
Michigan goalkeeper Chris Blais and the Wolverine
defense kept the ball out of net for several long Penn
State attacks, but eventually senior Drew Cost put a
goal on the board for the Nittany Lions.
Penn State began the second half with a surge, but
Michigan grabbed the momentum again when Meram

Yost Ice Arena isn't known as a quiet
place. But for a few seconds in the Mich-

team's bout NOTRE DAME 3
with No. 11 MICHIGAN 1

on Saturday, MICHIGAN 5
the capacity
crowd stayed
hushed. Most were looking for the puck.
Others just didn't want to give its loca-
tion away.
Midway through the second period
of the Wolverines' 5-3 win Saturday,
the puck disappeared like it was in a
magician's act from most of the 6,887 in
attendance, including most of the play-
ers on the ice midway through the sec-

ond period.
As Michigan tried to rebound from
Friday's 3-1 loss, freshman defenseman
Jon Merrill ripped a slap shot from the
point that seemed to get lost in fresh-
man forward Luke Moffatt's equipment
in front. Eyes turned on Moffatt while
he hacked at his feet, but the puck had
actually deflected off of Moffatt and
into the air, landing between the boards
and faceoff circle.
Senior defenseman Chad Langlais,,
one of the few players if not the only one
on the ice to know where the puck was,
calmly skated down from the point and
deposited it in the net as Notre Dame
goaltender Mike Johnson continued to
focus on Moffatt.
"(Sophomore Chris Brown) tipped it
- Jon Merrill's shot - and it hit me in
the pant," Moffatt said after the game.

"Everyone was kind of looking at me,
so I thought it was in my pant and it
shot out to Langlais coming downs the
boards."
The goal was the latest example of
a phenomenon Michigan coach Red
Berenson has coined "puck luck." Basi-
cally, when Berenson's teams are work-
ing hard and getting shots, they get the
bounces. But continuing the trend of the
past four weekends, the puck luck only
showed up in the second game of the
series.
Friday night, Langlais beat Johnson
five-hole, only to have the puck roll past
the far post, Saturday night, the final
three Michigan goals came off deflec-
tions: the Langlais goal, one off a Notre
Dame player and senior forward Carl
Hagelin's shin pad, and the final one off

Steve Burns
has fought
for a lot of things in his time in
Ann Arbor. And yesterday, as his
hand-picked players gave him the
customary Gatorade shower in the
waning seconds of the Wolverines'
first-ever Big Ten championship, it
became clear that Burns deserves a
triumphant round of applause.
For all the incredible things
that Michigan's slew of legendary
coaches have done, not many of
them have built a team with his/her
bare hands. Bo Schembechler didn't
have to convince fans that they
should come to Michigan football
games. Burns, on the other hand,
has used the popularity of last sum-
me,'s World Cup to change how
students and alumni look at soccer
in Ann Arbor.
The soccer team now has one of
the best complexes in the country.
And that should be a significant
bargaining chip when it comes to
convincing recruits like Saad to
continue filteringtto State Street.
With that complex came a host
of new fans, coined the Michigan
Ultras, who ran a very effective
campaign to gain new group mem-
bers, giving out shirts and scarves
as incentive to come to games. The

For the Daily
STATE COLLEGE - Enter-
ing the Big Ten Tournament, it
wasn't clear whether the Michi-
gan men's soccer team's resume
was good enough to earn a spot
in the NCAA Tournament. After
yesterday, the Wolverines are
guaranteed an NCAA Tourna-
ment berth and are also looking
to secure a home game and a first-
round bye.
In winning its first Big Ten
championship in its 11-year his-
tory, Michigan clinched the con-
ferences' automatic bid for the
NCAA Tournament. The victory
came against a Penn State team
that has won the tournament
three times, tied for second-most
in Big Ten Tournament history.
"It's a comforting feeling,"
Michigan coach Steve Burns said.
"A lot of teams who are sitting on
the bubble have their thoughts
churning right now."
Michigan's best Big Ten Tour-
nament finish prior to yesterday's
championship victory came in
2002 when the team lost to the
Nittany Lions 2-1 in the finals.
Burns said he expects his team
to be seeded, meaning it would
earn a first-round bye. In the
48-team field, the top 16 teams
receive byes and the remaining
teams battle play in the opening
round of 32. Burns hopes that
if Michigan (14-4-3) can't get a
seed, it will at least get a home
game in the first round.
After Thursday's 2-1 win over
Michigan State in the Big Ten

Lions on Penn State's home field

Championship and a spot in th

look at this group of guys and w
recruited these guys to come t
Michigan to win championship
and they're delivering."
The Wolverines last appeare
in the NCAA Tournament i
2008, making it to the round o
16.
"It was great to go in 2008,
but we felt like we left something
short, so winning this tourna-
ment gives us more momentum
going into the NCAAs," senior
midfielder Alex Wood said.
Although none of the Big Ten
teams reside in the top 25, the
conference is expected to send
four or five teams into the NCAA
field. However, Michigan is the
only one that knows already, for
sure, that it will be going.
Michigan will find out where
exactly it falls in the NCAA
bracket today at 4:30 p.m. The
team plans to gather at Packard
Pub on State Street in Ann Arbor
with the Michigan Ultras fanclub
as it watches the NCAA Men's
Division-I Selection Show on
ESPNU.


Michigan men's soccer coach Steve Burns has been the Wolverines'only coach in its

conversation as the Maize Rage and
the Children of Yost.
And they're catchingtip to both
of them fast - really fast.
Much of that meteoric rise
should be credited to Burns (as well
as some really dedicated students)
who have proved - at least for now
- that students care about soccer on
a campus that is all about football.
Burns picked up his and the
program's 100th win last weekend
against Northwestern, then tore
through the competition at this
weekend's Big Ten Tournament,
putting the cherry on top with a
dominant 4-1 drubbing ofhost Pen
State.
The coach has gotten used to
winning, with 10-plus wins ii eight
of the program's 11 seasons (iisclud-
ing this year). He won back-to-back
national titles at the club level
before the team was a varsity sport

(in 1997 and 1998). Not to mention,
he's put six Michigan players into
the MLS.
And this season, though the
-Wolverines don't have their high-
est ranking in program history,
Burns may have put together his
best team, his piece de resistance of
coaching.
The Saad brothers are sensa-
tional and will be for years to come.
Chris Blais is one of the best goal-
keepers in the conference. And the
team boasts a handful of veteran
playmakers, something ever cham-
pionship team needs to succeed.
But most of all, Burns has proved
his worth as an asset in the Michi-
gan sports landscape. He knows
how to work with his talent, he
knows how to keep his players
motivated and most of all, he knows
Michigan. After all, he's been a part
of the Michigan soccer program

t1-year history.
since he played on the club team,
starting in 1984.
Now, it's clear that Steve Burns
is the Michigan men's soccer pro-
gram. Like Red Berenson for hock-
ey, Burns has taken a blank canvas
and turned it into a work of art.
Burns has a longsway to catch
Berenson as far as winning goes -
he trails him by 602 total wins. But
that's no knock on Burns.
He's the reason why, when I
walked into my friend's room
yesterday afternoon, a crowd had
already formed around the TV, sim-
ply to watch Michigan soccer.
And for that - something I
thought I'd never see when I first
came to Ann Arbor - I applaud
you, Steve Burns.
A job very well done.

delivered a turn-around strike.
It was sure to be Meram's third
goal of the game until sopho-
more Penn State defender Brian
Porgue dove in front of the shot,
blocking it with his hands.
Forgue received a red card
and the Wolverines were award-
ed a penalty kick. Sophomore
midfielder Hamoody Saad took
the penalty and scored after his
shot bounced off both the goal-
keeper and the post.
"We had a thing, the three
amigos: one, two, and three,"
Meram said of himself and the
Saads. "All three of us wanted
to score. We had confidence
in Hamoody. We knew he was

going to bury it, and he did,"
At that point in the second
half, the Nittany Lions were
down three goals and one play-
er. Still, they continued attack-
ing and the game maintained
its rapid pace. Towards the end,
Penn State's frustration became
apparent in its play while Michi-
gan calmly possessed, the ball.
The 4-1 lead proved insurmount-
able for the Nittany Lions, who
essentially admitted defeat by put-
ting in their reserves with 15 min-
utes still remaining in the game.
Then, the win was imminent.
"As the newest varsity team
at Michigan, it has taken us 11
years to be able to bring what we
feel every other team at Michi-
gan has brought - that is cham-
pionships," Burns said. "We are
glad we are able to contribute."

Despite only forcing 12 turnovers,
Michigan made life miserable for the

ball and getting in the face of shoot-
ers when they had quality attempts,
which were few and far between.
The Wolverines limited their
own turnovers, thus preventing

Spartans to run their half-court
offense, which just never seemed
to click due to Michigan's quality
defensive play. Michigan didn't even
have an offensive scoutingreport for
the game due to USC-Upstate's ros-
ter turnover from a year ago, mean-
ing that the Wolverines just had to
focus even harder on playing quality
defense, according to Beilein. They
answered the bell, as the Spartans
shot just 22.2 percent from the field
for the game.
"We're probably right where we
should be (defensively) with the idea
that it's the first game," Beilein said.
"It's going to be really difficult and
a challenge for us everyday to con-
tinue to play defense so that we can
rebound and then score points. ...
We think we've really stepped up
with playing defense. (Assistant
coaches LaVall Jordan, Bacari
Alexander and Jeff Meyer) have
done a great job improving what
we do defensively."
Beilein cautioned that his team
will have to capitalize on the type
of fast-break opportunities that
the Wolverines often struggled
to convert against USC-Upstate.
Ideally, in a game like Saturday's,
Beilein said Michigan would have
75 or 80 points.
But for ateam that has only two
upperclassmen, the Wolverines
accomplished everything that they
needed to in their first game.
"(There are) still a lot of things
to work on but we improved com-
pletely and we got better as the
game went on, didn't let up in the
second half," Douglass said. "I
couldn't be prouder about the way
we played."

and let him see what's going on
out there."
Robinson and Forcier rotated
drives from the point Robin-
son was taken out until the end
of the game. Robinson ended
up in the game on the Wolver-
ines' final possession, during
which he made two clutch plays
to keep the drive alive and the
clock ticking: an 11-yard scam-
per on a third-and-nine and a
25-yard pass to junior tight end
Kevin Koger on another third
down.
The drive ended with a touch-
down run by freshman running
back Stephen Hopkins which
effectively sealed the game.
Nearing the end of a sensa-
tional first season as a starter,
Robinson had one of the worst
games of his young career. The
sophomore completed 13-of-21

passes through the air with one
passing touchdown and two
interceptions. Saturday was the
first time Robinson was pulled
because of performance, or lack
thereof, as opposed to injury.
For his part, Forcier didn't
mind being rotated in and out of
the game.
"I'm just happy to get out
there and play," Forcier said.
"It's cool that he's rotating guys
out, I didn't mind that at all. ...
The coaches are putting in who
they have to put in to win the
game and we won the game."
Forcier didn't get much going
on his drives. The sophomore
went 1-for-4 passing for 17 yards
as well as three yards rushing.
He was also sacked once.
Robinson, as usual, was less
talkative but said the same thing
when asked if it was a problem
for him going in every other
drive.
"No, it wasn't," Robinson said.
"You got to be ready at all times."

Daily Sports Writer
Four years removed from its
last NCAA Tournament bid, the
Michigan
women's OK STATE 2
soccer team MICHIGAN 1
was desper-
ate to hustle until the final min-
ute of the season.
Those precious seconds final-
ly ticked off of the clock Friday
night in Stillwater, Okla. as the
Wolverines fell to host No. 6
Oklahoma State 2-1 in the tour-
nament's first round.
"It was just a really even
game," Michigan coach Greg
Ryan said after the game. "It was
a game that came down to some
mistakes."
An enthusiastic Michigan
squad took a 1-0 advantage into
halftime off of a goal by fresh-
man Tori McCombs. Just when
it seemed the Wolverines were
poised for a magical postseason
run, the wheels fell off, leading to
a first-round exit.
Michigan (5-3-2 Big Ten, 10-5-
4 overall) could not afford to lend
any momentum to the Cowgirls
(8-2 Big 12, 18-3-2), who were
playing on their home field. Early
in the second half, an Oklahoma
State set piece led to an equalizer
that Wolverine goalkeeper Haley
Kopmeyer barely missed scoop-
ing up.
"We didn't defend their free

kick well," Ryan said. "It was
very easy to defend. We let them
back into the game."
The woes continued for Michi-
ganjust two minutes later when a
loose ball squirted right onto the
awaiting foot of junior Cowgirl
Krista Lopez. She easily knocked
it in for the eventual game win-
ner.
As could only be expected
after the thrilling upsets the
Wolverines have pulled off
throughout the season, the team
fought until the bitter end. Shots
were fired until just seconds
remained, but any hope of a last-
second miracle was thwarted
by superb Oklahoma State goal-
keeping on the part of sopho-
more Adrianna Franeh.
The loss ended the careers of
five seniors on the roster. Only
redshirt senior Kylie Nescbke
had previous NCAA experience,
as she was a part of the Wolver-
ine squad that lost in penalty
kicks to Wisconsin-Milwaukee

Rodriguez says
'D' has best day on
third downs
of entire season
By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Writer
WEST LAFAYETTE - For
weeks, Michigan football fans
watched the Wolverines allow
opponents to
convert third NOTEBOOK
downs at an
alarming rate. Third and short,
third and long - it didn't matter.
Michigan's first loss came
to Michigan State, which con-
verted four of 13 third-down
attempts (30.8 percent). A week
later, Michigan lost to Iowa,
which converted seven of 13
third-down attempts (53.8).
And in perhaps the Wolver-

ines' most disappointing loss so
far, Penn State converted100 of16
third-down attempts (62.5).
For comparison's sake, Michi-
gan - the fifth-best offense in
the nation, in terms of total yard-
age -converts nearly 47 percent
of third-down attempts.
But Michigan's defense made
a statement against Purdue on
Saturday. The Boilermakers suc-
ceeded on just two of their 17
third-down attempts (11.8 per-
cent). Though part of that was
due to the rain and wind, which
certainly didn't help Purdue
quarterbacks in those situations,
the rest of the credit goes to the
Michigan's defense's ability to
create pressure and tackle well.
"Our third-down defense was
the best it's been all year," Mich-
igan coach Rich Rodriguez said
after the game.
Statistically, that was true.
More important was the feeling
that Purdue's sputtering offense

didn't get anything going against
a Michigan defense that made
the key plays when it needed to.
"I feel like on third down we
won," redshirt sophomore line-
backer Kenny Demens said. "All
season long we've struggled
with what went wrong on third
down but we played with a little
spark today."
KERRIGAN'S RECORD DAY:
Lost in Purdue's inept and turn-
over-happy day on offense was
the Boilermakers' defensive
playmaker's big day.
Senior defensive end Ryan
Kerrigan recorded 10 tackles,
five tackles for loss, four sacks,
two forced fumbles and a fumble
recovery in Saturday's game. He
now owns the Big Ten record for
career forced fumbles (14) and
has tied the FBS record.
Coming into the game, the
Michigan offense had allowed
just four sacks all year.
Michigan sophomore quarter-

back Tate Forcier called Kerri-
gan "a monster." Rodriguez said
his team had a hard time with
him at various points through-
out the game.
"He just plays his heart out
every snap every day," Purdue
coach Danny Hope said. "NFL
scouts come to practice, and they
watch him, and they like him.
Then they watch film on him all
day long, and they like him even
more because they realize he's
got a great motor, a relentless
effort.
"He's a very unselfish player.
He plays for the team first. He
plays inspired football. ... He
deserves all the accolades and
attention he's getting. He's defi-
nitely one of the best defensive
players in the country."
Even Michigan's defensive
players had nothing but praise
for Kerrigan.
"I recognize a good game
and he has a real good game,"

Demens said. "He went out there
and did his thing. He's just a
great player. A lot of credit goes
out to him on defense.
KICKING THEMSELVES: After
a missed field goal and a missed
extra point, redshirt freshman
Seth Broekhuizen lost his pre-
carious hold on the kicking job.
Rodriguez said he would
"probably" open up the kicking
competition again, allowing red-
shirt freshman Brendan Gibbons
another chance to win back the
job he had at the start of the sea-
son.
"It was a disappointing day
from that standpoint because
(Broekhuizen) has been kicking
great in practice," Rodriguez
said. "We've struggled all year,
but he's clearly the best one in
practice. ... We'll see what hap-
pens this week in practice."
Michigan kickers have made
just four of 12 field goal attempts
this season.

ball. We haven't had a game like
this all year and we have a lot to
learn from it."
The weather especially affected
Robinson, the sophomore quarter-
back. After committing his fourth
turnover of the game in the third
quarter when Purdue defensive
end Ryan Kerrigan knocked the
ball out of his hands, Rodriguez
put sophomore backup quarter-
back Tate Forcier in the game to
try and give Robinson some time
to regain his composure.
Rodriguez decided to "go by
feel" from then on out, switching
back and forth between the two
signal callers for the remainder of
the game.

For once, the offense - ranked
No. 5 in the nation before this
game - just couldn't move the ball
like it did last week against Illi-
nois, when Michigan accounted
for 67 points.
But in as bizarre a game as Sat-
urday's, it was the defense that
brought the Wolverines to .500 in
the Big Ten.
Michigan's 115th-ranked pass
defense held Purdue (4-6, 2-4) to
132 yards and forced a pair of inter-
ceptions - its best performance of
the season. The defense forced five
turnovers for the first time since
Sept. 10, 2007. And the Wolverines
kept their opponent out of the end-
zone on offense for the first time
since Michigan's blowout win over
Delaware State last season.
For redshirt sophomore line-
backer Kenny Demens, the wet,
sloppy conditions gave Michigan's

defense a perfect opportunity to
have its best showing of the year.
"Oh my God, I love it," Demens
said. "We all love it. Just to get out
there and get dirty and play hard
and just come downhill, it was
really fun."
Although Purdue's offense has
struggled all season, Demens said
the confidence from a game like
this is invaluable to a Wolverine
defense that has had plenty of its
own struggles.
"In the locker room after the
game, the offense was just patting
us on our back and just thanking
us," he said. "We been down in
the slumps and the offense picked
us up the whole season so it was
about time we could do that for
them and just get a win."
"It shows not just us but the
country that we can really go out
there and compete."
