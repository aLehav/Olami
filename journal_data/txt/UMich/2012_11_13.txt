At its monthly meeting on
Thursday, the University's

Board of Regents is set to
approve a host of renovation
projects across campus, rang-
ing from minor structural and
maintenance needs to large-
scale renovations of iconic
campus buildings.
Among upgrades the board
will consider is the mainte-
nance of existing structures
at Michigan Stadium, the Wil-

liam L. Clements Library, the
basement of the College of
Pharmacy, the North Campus
Research Complex and a tunnel
along South University Avenue

Michigan Stadium, built in
1927, is in need of $6 million in*

FACULTY GOVERNANCE
SACUA inquires
into increase i
grievances filed
by 'U' faculty

SPECIAL VISITORS

increased faculty
representation on
N search committees
ByAUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily StaffReporter
An uptick in the number of
faculty complaints filed under
the University's grievance pro-
cedure this year led to concern
among faculty members at Mon-
day's senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs
meeting.
Under the procedure, which
was approved in April 2011, Uni-
versity faculty have filed at most
one complaint in an academic
year. The program serves as a
tool for faculty to raise issues
with the administration of aca-
demic units and their leader-
ship.
The three grievances filed
already this year prompted
speculation at Monday's meet-

ing about whether the increase
in the incidence of little-used
procedure is an aberration or a
sign of unrest among faculty.
Social Work Associate Prof.
Karen Staller, SACUA vice chair
and the faculty grievance moni-
tor, said it is unclear whether
this increase is an anomaly or
the start of a trend.
At their weekly meeting,
SACUA members also discussed
a model for appointing faculty
members to executive search
committees, such as the search
for the next University presi-
dent, and methods of alleviating
low attendance at the organiza-
tion's gatherings.
In a typical year, there are
zero complaints filed by faculty,
but so far this year, there have
been three. Social Work Associ-
ate Prof. Karen Staller, SACUA
vice chair and the faculty griev-
ance monitor, said it is unclear
whether this increase is an
anomaly or the start of a trend.

ance procedure was adopted

Israel reports 'direct hits'
on Syrian artillery target I

First direct clash
between countries in
two years
TEL HAZEKA, Golan Heights
(AP) - Israeli tanks struck a Syr-
ian artillery launcher Monday
after a stray mortar shell flew
into Israel-held territory, the
first direct clash between the
neighbors since the Syrian upris-
ing began nearly two years ago.
The confrontation fueled
new fears that the Syrian civil
war could drag Israel into the
violence, a scenario with grave
consequences for the region. The
fighting has already spilled into
Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey.
"We are closely monitor-
ing what is happening and will
respond appropriately. We will
not allow our borders to be vio-
lated or our citizens to be fired
upon," Prime Minister Benja-
min Netanyahu said Monday in
a speech to foreign ambassadors.

While officials believe Presi-
dent Bashar Assad hias no inter-
est in picking a fight with Israel,
they fear the embattled Syrian
leader maytry to draw Israel into
the fighting in a bout of despera-
tion. Israeli officials believe it is
only amatter of time before Syr-
ian rebels topple -the longtime
leader.
The conflict has already
spilled over into several of Syr-
'ia's other neighbors - whether
in direct violence or in the flood
of refugees fleeing the blood-
shed. More than 36,000 Syrians
have been killed in the fighting,
according to estimates by anti-
Assad activists.
On Monday, a Syrian fighter
jet bombed a rebel-held area
hugging the border with Turkey
three times, killing 15 to 20 peo-
ple, according to a Turkish offi-
cial. Separately, eight wounded
Syrians died in Turkey, the offi-
cial said, speaking on condition
of anonymity because he was not
authorized to brief the media.

Potential Israeli involvement
in Syria could be far more explo-
sive. The bitter enemies both
possess air forces, tanks and sig-
nificant arsenals of missiles and
other weapons.
Although the Israeli military
is more modern and powerful,
Syria has a collection of chemical
weapons that could wreak havoc
if deployed. Fighting between
the countries could also drag in
Syria's close ally, the Lebanese
guerrilla group Hezbollah, or
Islamic militant groups in the
Gaza Strip on Israel's southern
flank.
Israeli political scientist Dore
Gold, an informal adviser to
Netanyahu, said neither Israel
nor Syria has any interest in
escalating the fighting.
"I see no indication of Assad
wanting to draw Israel in. But if
violence comes from the Syrian
army, or even forces operating
in Syria that are affiliated, with
al-Qaida, Israel has to do what is
necessaryto make sure there's no

CIA Director
resigns after
extramarital affair
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - CIA
Director David Petraeus was
shocked to learn last summer
that his mistress was suspected
of sending threatening emails
warning another woman to stay
away from him, former staff
members and friends told The
Associated Press Monday.
Petraeus told these associates
his relationship with the second,
woman, Tampa socialite Jill
Kelley, was platonic, though his
biographer-turned-lover Paula
Broadwell apparently saw her
as a romantic rival. Retired Gen.
Petraeus also denied to these
associates that he had given
Broadwell any of the sensitive
military information alleged to
have been found on her comput-
er, saying anything she had must
have been provided by other
commanders during reporting
trips to Afghanistan.
The associates spoke on con-
dition of anonymity because
they weren't authorized to pub-

licly discuss the matters, which
could be part of an FBI investi-
gation.
Petraeus, who led U.S. mili-
tary efforts in Iraq and Afghan-
istan, resigned his CIA post
Friday, acknowledging his extra-
marital affair with Broadwell
and expressing deep regret.
New details of the investiga-
tion that brought an end to his
storied career emerged as Presi-
dent Barack Obama hunted for a
new CIA director and members
of Congress questioned why the
months-long probe was kept
quiet for so long.
Kelley, the Tampa woman,
began receiving harassing
emails in May, according to two
federal law enforcement offi-
cials. They, too, spoke only on
condition of anonymity because
they were not authorized to
speak publicly about the matter.
The emails led Kelley to report.
the matter, eventually triggering
the investigation that led Petrae-
us to resign as head of the intel-
ligence agency.
FBI agents traced the alleged
cyber harassment to Broadwell,
the officials said, and discovered
she was exchanging intimate

messages with a private gmail
account. Further investigation
revealed the accountbelonged to
Petraeus under an alias.
Petraeus and Broadwell
apparently used a trick, known
to terrorists and teenagers alike,
to concealitheir email traffic, one
of the law enforcement officials
said.
Rather than transmitting
emails to the other's inbox, they
composed at least some mes-
sages and instead of transmit-
ting them, left them in a draft
folder or in an electronic "drop-
box," the official said. Then the
other person could log onto the
same account and read the draft
emails there. This avoids creat-
ing an email trail that is easier
to trace.
Broadwell had co-authored
a biography titled "All In: The
Education of General David
Petraeus," published in January.
In the preface, she said she met
Petraeus in the spring of 2006
while she was a graduate stu-
dent at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard and she
ended up following him on mul-
tiple trips to Afghanistan as part
of her research.

paigns are multi-year projects,
the groundwork being laid now
will likely determine the course
of the campaign.
Also spearheading the effort
will be Jerry May, the Univer-
sity's vice president for develop-
ment. In September, May said
Coleman had a proven track
record for bringing in donor con-
tributions, going so far as to call
her one of the most "effective
presidents in the country, by far,

in fundraising."
The University is also expect-
ed to expand its geographic
focus during the upcoming cam-
paign; with a particular empha-
sis on the West Coast. Speaking
to the faculty governing body
last spring, May said the Univer-
sity was competing with other
schools for donations.
"If we're not out there ...
they're giving to Stanford," May
said at the time. "The competi-
tion is out there, and they are
working hard to make their uni-
versities great."
At the time of its completion,

the Michigan Difference cam-
paign was the largest fundrais-
ing drive ever undertaken by a
public university in the United
States.
Donations from the campaign
contributed to the construction-
of 22 new campus buildings,
including the Ross School of
Business and the new C.S. Mott
Children's and Von Voigtlander
Women's Hospital. It also funded
1,969 new scholarships and 185
named professorships.

professors, research scientists
and other members of faculty
to file complaints with the Uni-
versity about decisions made by
academic units, departments,
deans or department chairs.
The grievance board is run
by the University's Academic
Human Resources Department
and attempts to confidentially
resolve conflicts.
The University's grievance
procedure is only a model, and it
is in the process of being adopted
by individual schools and col-
leges. While some colleges have
adopted the procedure verbatim,
schools like the Medical School,
have changed the procedure to
fit their needs.
The faculty grievance moni-
tor, appointed by SACUA,
attends grievance board meet-
ings and reads papers submitted
to the board to ensure the fac-
ulty's needs are met and proper
procedure is followed.
Several SACUA members
applauded Staller for her work
as the faculty grievance monitor,
but were concerned that the job
was too much for a single person
to handle. They brought up the
possibility of appointing mul-
tiple people to fill the position
in the future, especially if the

SACUA members also dis-
cussed the need for an increased
number of faculty members sit-

mittees and passed a resolution
asking the regents to choose fac-
ulty members on future search
committees from a list created by
SACUA and ratified by the Uni-

in important leadership posi-

are being used to find the next
University General Counsel and
the permanent director of the
University Police Department,
which is currently run by inter-
im director Joe Piersante.
SACUA chair Kimberlee Kear-
fott, a medical school professor,
said she is especially interested
in the makeup of the University's
Presidential Search Committee,
which will most likely be formed
in the coming year. University
President Mary Sue Coleman
does not plan to stay at the Uni-

versify after her contract expires
in 2014.
Kearfott said she wants to
ensure that faculty members are
properly represented.
"We want to make sure that
our voices are included in any
selections of executive officers so
that our perspectives are made
known during the search and so
our insights are taken advantage
of so the best possible people can
be found and selected," Kearfott
said.
SACUA DISCUSSES
COMMITTEE ATTENDANCE
CONCERNS
Several SACUA members also
addressed low attendance num-
bers at various committee meet-
ings. Many members thought
the enthusiasm of a commit-
tee's leader plays a large role in
encouraging faculty to attend.
Sally Oey, an astronomy asso-
ciate professor and a SACUA
member, pointed out that if fac-
ulty members want more control
over the University, they need to
show up at meetings.
"When the administrators
take time from their day to come
have lunch with us, the least we
can do is to try to reciprocate,"
Oey said. "It just doesn't look
that good when we say we want
to be more involved (with Uni-
versity affairs) and there are no-
gos."

However, complicating the
project are environmental con-

Slottow.
"The project will include
appropriate lead mitigation

If approved by the board, the

RENOVATION OF EARL V.
MOORE BUILDING
The largest renovation the
board will discusswill be the Earl
V. Moore building on North Cam-
pus, totaling an estimated cost of
$23.2 million for a complete over-
haul of the existingstructure.
The Moore building was built
in 1964 and currently houses the
SchoolofMusic,Theatre&Dance.
Over the years, the structure has
become dilapidated and outdated,
inhibitingthe performance of the
facility and its students. At the

news/coleman-announces-fel-
lowship-water-center ">Univer-
sity's annual leadership breakfast
on Oct. 29, University President'
Mary Sue Coleman announced
that alumni Bill and Dee Brehm
had donated $8 million toward
the $23-million project. The Uni-
versity hopes to receive an addi-
tional $1 million from smaller
alumni donations.
If approved by the board on
Thursday, the University will
contribute $14 million to com-
plete the renovation.
"I know the faculty from
Music, Theatre & Dance will
agree when I say this project is
overdue," Coleman said at the
leadership breakfast.
In a communication to the
board, Slottow wrote that the
work would add 21,000 square
feet to the building in the form a
new lecture hall, rehearsal hall,
classrooms, practice rooms and
storage space.
Improvements to the quality of
existingfacilities aswell as "archi-
tectural, mechanical, and electri-

cal work necessary to accomplish
these improvements" are included
in the estimated cost.
Slottow wrote that the Univer-
sity will return to the board with
a firmer construction schedule
once it has received an archi-
tectural design from Integrated
Design Solutions, the firm select-
ed to carry out the renovation.
In a separate communication,
Slottow and Christopher Kendall,
the dean of the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance, wrote that they
would requestrthat the board des-
ignate the building's addition as
the Brehm Pavilion in honor of
the donors.
BOARD TO VOTE ON
UPDATES TO NCRC
The second-largest ticket item
on the renovation schedule is a
proposed $17.5-million overhaul
of the East Wing of Building 20
of the North Campus Research
Complex. Slottow wrote in a
communication to the regents
that the building, built in 1956,
is in its original condition and
in need of modernization before
it can be used as a biomedical
research lab.
"The renovation will update
infrastructure, including new
air-handlingunits; primary heat-
ing, ventilation, and cooling dis-
tribution systems; plumbing and
renovated toilet room facilities;
accessibility improvements; and
wired and wireless high-speed
network access," Slottow wrote.
If the regents approve the
project, it will have an estimated
completion date of winter 2014,
according to Slottow.
STUDENTS TO PROPOSE
RENOVATIONS TO UNIONS,
RECREATIONAL CENTERS
Though not included on the
official agenda for the meeting,
the board is also expected to hear
from the student advisory group
Building a Better Michigan.
The group is sponsored by the
Division of Student Affairs, and
it has created a comprehensive
long-term plan to renovate the
University Unions, the CCRB
and the IM Building.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily on Monday, Cole-
man said the Division of Student
Affairs has worked very closely
with students to determine what

elements would be critical in a
future renovation of both types
of facilities. However, she noted
that finding a viable "revenue
stream" was equally, if not more,
important.
"This is a multi-year process,
obviously, because these are
big, big projects," Coleman said.
"This is not something you'd do
overnight."
Coleman compared the under-
taking to the ongoing Residence
Life Initiative, the University's
plan for the modernization
and updating of residence halls
across campus. According to
Coleman, it took years of plan-
ning to adequately prepare for
those projects, and renovations
for the Unions and recreational
centers is anundertaking ofsimi-
lar magnitude.
"For me, it was very important
to get the residence halls under-
way because (that's) a lot of stu-
dent's lives," Coleman said. "I'm
delighted that we can now be
talking about these other ideas,
because I know there's been a lot
of discussion amongstudents."
She added that a new student
fee is on the table, something
the University has traditionally
avoided, according to E. Roys-
ter Harper, the University's vice
president for student affairs.
Harper echoed Coleman, and
said the need to balance the "cost
of education" with the "need to
renovate" was the primary con-
cern.
"We want to make sure we get
it right," Harper said. "We want
to make sure the facilities are
good (and) the fields are good as
we talk about health and well-
ness."
Harper added that the expanse
of the recreation facilities makes
the project difficult.
"We're challenged in a way
that some institutions are not
because we've got three (rec-
reational centers and unions)
instead of one," Harper said.
Building a Better Michigan
is expected to present evidence
to the board that shows that 87
percent of students say renova-
tion of the University Unions
and the recreational centers is a
"priority" and that 67 percent of
students would support a fee of
$100 to accomplish the renova-
tions. 58 percent of students sur-
veyed said they would support a
fee between $150 and $200.


members."
The program costs $160 and
includes a free meal at the begin-
ning of each session before
breaking into spousal, teenage
and school-aged support groups.
The program has completed one
cycle with eight female par-
ticipants and is currently in its
second cycle with seven female
participants, according to Kees.
"Because this is part of a
development program, we are
doing a pre-assessment, a post-
assessment and a three-month
follow up," Kees said. "It's not
enough to say we see a need and
we have some good ideas for a
program. We want to really see if
the program is helping individu-
als become more resilient and
develop better coping skills."
In addition to teaching coping
skills, the program builds social
relationships among spouses.
"One of the. common experi-
ences we've heard from military
spouses, in particular National
Guard and the Reserve compo-
nent, is the inherent feeling of
isolation," Kees said. "Through
HomeFront Strong, they are able
to connect with each other and

truly see that they are not alone
in this experience."
Kees said the program also
strives to raise awareness about
the lack of support military
families receive, and to promote
solidarity for them in the com-
munity.
"I think HomeFront Strong is
a great program that has a lot of
potential, but at the end of the
day one of the things that can
truly help these families is for
neighbors to be aware that these
families are in our community,
they're in our schools, they're
at Kroger, they're at the soccer
game," Kees said.
Raising awareness is not the
only goal on the horizon, and
HomeFront Strong also hopes to
expand to other military families
in Michigan communities.
"Our next step will be part-
nering with community agen-
cies and continue to develop
the model and hopefully imple-
ment it at other sites," Kees said.
"We're very aware that there
are many military families in
other places than Ann Arbor and
we need to do our best to reach
them."

searches, and the concept found
its feet in a business market-
ing class where the professor
encouraged the group to go for it.
According to Okrasinski,
founder and Marketing and
Design manager, the hardest part
of the project was aggregating all
the listings.
, "It was a daunting challenge
considering the number of real-
tor websites and how crappy
and inconsistent they are at
displaying information," Okra-
sinski wrote in an e-mail inter-
view. He distinguishes A2Cribs
from other housingsites that are
more nationally focused.
"Most housing sites have
focused on the broader prob-
lem, in which they have many
listings all across the country,"
Okrasinski said. "These sites are
moderately helpful at displaying
rentals in big cities, but are pretty
bad at helping students on a local
scale."
With over 2,500 listings,
A2Cribs aims to make the off
campus housing search a more
transparent process by includ-
ing pertinent details, such as the
additional costs of utilities and
whether or not parking spaces
and furnishings are included.
Many of the listings also provide
a direct link to the realty com-

pany's website where students
can inquire about the property,
Okrasinski said. The website also
provides easy access through
a Facebook login feature and
allows students to "star" their
favorite listings in order to better
compare them to other favorite
listings.
By the end of November, the
A2Cribs team plans to show
which of the listings on the site
are already leased, and by next
January students will have the
opportunity to post subleases,
much like Craigslist or Facebook,.
Okrasinski added.
"We ultimately want to make
it simple for students to find an
available listing, compare it to
others, and sign the lease," Okra-
sinski said.
Administrative assistant
Megan Phelps of Investor's Prop-
erty Management, an Ann Arbor
realty company with properties
listed on A2Cribs, praised the
functional format and conve-
nient features of the website in
an e-mail interview.
"I will definitely recommend
this website to students who
call us looking for places that
don't fit anything we have left
to offer," Phelps said. "Anything
that makes students' lives easier
makes our jobs easier too."
In the future, the operation
costs of the website will be cov-
ered through advertising place-
ments, Okrasinski said. For now,

the site is currently free for both
renters and realtors.
Though School of Educa-
tion senior Monica Beal said she
liked the idea of the website, she
expressed concern that the new
website does not include all of
Ann Arbor's potential leasing
options.
"I think it's' very convenient
because house hunting Ann
Arbor is a pain," Beal said. "It's
very user friendly and it's nice
to have everything in one spot. I
guess my concern would be thatit
does not include all the available
housing options. For instance, my
apartment building isn't listed."
LSA junior Stephan Bradley, a
Residential Assistant in Mosher-
Jordan Residence Hall, said he
hoped that the website's found-
ers will adjust the currentpricing
for their residence hall listings
according to impending changes
in the costs of room and board for
next year.
"By justlooking atthe prices of
the dorms for University housing,
I see that it is using the rates for
this year, without any disclaim-
er that the prices for next year
have not yet been set ... and they
are likely to increase," Bradley
said. "Therefore, if one is using
the site to look at properties for
next year, they could potentially
be misguided as to the prices of
the residence halls and univer-
sity apartments when comparing
them to other options."

Time to follow suit
Same-sex marriage should be legalized nationally
n Election Day, Maryland, Maine and Washington state legal-
ized same-sex marriage, joining six states and the District of
Columbia that had already legalized same-sex marriage. It's a
step in the right direction toward giving every citizen the undeniable
right to marry whomever they choose - a right that should be extend-
ed to everybody regardless of race, gender, religion or sexual orienta-
tion. While the approval of same-sex marriage in these three states is
an excellent step forward, it's disappointing that other states haven't
taken similar steps. While marriage should be a completely undeniable
right, states do have the power to decide if same-sex marriage is legal.
And at the very least, states should not be able to deny recognition to

Are you sure it was rape? Maybe it was
just a bad hookup ... you should forgive
and forget.

same-sex couples.
According to a May 14 Gallup poll, 54 per-
cent of Americans believe that same-sex mar-
riage is morally acceptable, increasing from
38 percent in 2002. In addition, 63 percent of
people now believe that relations between gays
and lesbians should be legalup from 52 percent
in 2002. In fact, according to a Nov. 9 article in
The New York Times, Washington's same-sex
marriage opponents have officially conceded
and acknowledged the tremendous strides that
the gay rights movement has made. These are
significant milestones in the past 10 years. Gay
rights are becoming increasingly normalized
in the United States, as the prevalence of shows
such as "Modern Family" and "The New Nor-
mal" in current popular culture suggests.
While it seems that a majority of Americans
believe same-sex marriage should be legal,
the 10th Amendment gives states the power
to decide whether they'll allow same-sex mar-
riage. Unfortunately, the Defense of Marriage
Act of 1996 signed by President Bill Clinton
does not require that states recognize same-
sex marriages performed in other states; under
the contentious section 3 of DOMA, states do
not have to confer federal benefits, like Social
Security, upon gay and lesbian couples. Yet,
The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Con-
stitution mandates that each state respect the
"public acts, records, and judicial proceedings
of every other state."

The country should respect the Constitution
in this matter. Just because a state can refuse
to perform same-sex marriages doesn't mean
it should be able to deny the recognition of a
same-sex marriage. Marriage should be recog-
nized across the country regardless of which
state it was performed in. The repeal of DOMA
would prevent states from denying rights that
marriage gives same-sex couples. States recog-
nize driver's licenses from other states - rec-
ognizing a marriage between two people of the
same sex from another state is no different.
It's only a matter of time before same-sex
marriage will become legal in all states. For
this to happen sooner rather than later, states
should give their citizens the opportunity to
vote for it to become legal. Or at the very least,
states should recognize these marriages. Many
countries, such as South Africa, Belgium and
the Netherlands, already have legalized same-
sex marriage. Even countries with predomi-
nantly Catholic' populations, including Spain,
Portugal, Argentina and Brazil, have approved
same-sex civil unions and marriage. If coun-
tries that are largely religious allow equal
rights, there's no reason that the United States
shouldn't do the same. Marriage is an unde-
niable right that should not be denied to any
adult, and as the general population increas-
es its approval of same-sex marriage, states
should follow suit.

it's easy to lament the sore state
of the Ann Arbor parking situ-
ation, but determining a course
of action to rec-
tify it is a more
difficult affair.
This month
marks the start of
the University's
cofistruction of
a new parking
structure on Wall
Street. The pro- MICHAEL
posed structure SMALLEGAN
seems like a per-
fectly adequate
way to meet the increased parking
needs that came with the opening
of the new C. S. Mott Children's and
von voightlander Women's Hospital;
however, its placement and execution
create more problems than they fix.
Progress on the structure has
been steady since its approval by
the University's Board of Regents in
April, despite equally steady resis-
tance from residents in the Lower
Town area. Calls from area residents
to halt the project, though heard,
remain unheeded. With room for
725 cars, the 70-foot tall structure
will be an outlier in the mostly resi-
dential neighborhood speckled with
historic buildings and delineated by
a slow peaceful bend of the Huron
River. The move toward more Uni-
versity activity in this area is far from
unprecedented - it has been occur-
ring for the past 30 years.
The University is an institution
thathas driven to be the "Leaders and
Best." In its marching to the cease-
less tempo of "improve, expand" it

has acquired and demolished many
historically significant homes in the
area to make way for buildings and
parking lots. While the new struc-
ture will be partially constructed on
the location of an existing surface
parking lot, at least one home will be
demolished in the process.
The home in question, at 959 Wall
Street, has received the same prepar-
ative treatment as have other homes
lostto"progress" - acursoryarchae-
ological dig directed by Anthropol-
ogy Prof. Henry Wright. Though
he carries out these digs in earnest,
wright is given too little time for a
full treatment of the sites. Further-
more, this small gesture does little
to mitigate the loss of the historic
record that comes from demolishing
these homes and replacing the soil
underneath with culturally mean-
ingless, homogeneous loose stone
and concrete.
The loss of this part of Ann Arbor's
story is significant because of the role
this area played in our city's past. In
1830, with the construction of a flour-
mill on the Huron, the area gradually
became a booming business center.
Anson Brown, owner of the flourmill,
named the streets in the area after
those in New York, intending to cre-
ate a city center, a "downtown," that
would compete with the then-devel-
oping community that is our current
downtown. Many of the oldest hous-
es in Ann Arbor are in this area, and
with them, a fantastic record of some
of our community's past.
The establishment of the Univer-
sity and the location of the train sta-
tion gradually sucked the vibrancy

out of the area, and brought the
locus of attention south 'of the
Huron. It now seems the University
is finishing the job.
Parking in AA
may be tough, but
community must
be preserved.
Perhaps of even greater concern
than the disregard of the historical
record, the disturbance of the com-
munity's look and feel, the increased
traffic congestion, and concerns over
pedestrian safety is the environmen-
tal degradation that this new struc-
ture will bring. Lower Town is called
such because it is a low point topo-
logically in Ann Arbor, and with its
proximity to both Traver Creek and
the Huron River, the unavoidable
increase in runoff, that comes with
the addition of multiple thousands of
square feet of impermeable concrete
will undoubtedly have consequences
for the area's natural habitat.
The parking structure will be
built, University planners will be
happy and local residents will learn
to deal with it, but lessons can be
learned from this. There are other
solutions to the lack of parking near
campus. Let's have some smart peo-
ple find them next time.

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

Voter turnout rates in Ann
Arbor are difficult to measure
TO THE DAILY:
I am a Daily alum from about 40 years ago
and still live in Ann Arbor. I've been active in
local politics ever since. Your Friday lead story
about the campus vote really missed the mark.
Its conclusion is based on comparing two total-
ly different statistics. You compared the results
of an exit poll showing that 49 percent of people
under 30 voted this year with the percentage
of registered voters turning out in campus pre-
cincts. First, "under 30" and campus precincts
don't correlate, since the age range in campus
precincts is likely to skew significantly younger
than the total under-30 population.
More importantly, the percentage of regis-
tered voters turning out is an almost meaning-
less number, particularly in student precincts.
Because students move in and out of Ann Arbor
so frequently, there is a tremendous amount of
"deadwood" on the voter rolls in student pre-

cincts - people who are still listed there, but
have moved away. Many may have registered
elsewhere, but the old registrations are fre-
quently not cancelled. Also, a significant num-
ber of University students are registered at
their parents' homes, especially since Michigan
requires that your voting address and driver's
license address be the same.
From many years of experience in working
the student precincts, including this year, I can
tell you that an extremely small percentage of
students registered to vote here, who are actu-
ally still living here, fail to vote in a Presiden-
tial election. I would also be willing to bet that
more than 49 percent of University students
voted either in Ann Arbor or at "home" last
week, though that's ahard number to pin down.
There are very few Ann Arborites who are
eligible to vote who aren't registered here or
elsewhere, and their turnout rate for presiden-
tial elections probably exceeds 90 percent.
Tom Wieder
University alum

The University has nothing to
fear. As long as it exists, students will
come. And by come, I mean flock here
by the thousands. What prompts me
to say this is not the threat of rising
tuitionprices (eventhoughthat'strue
as well), but rather the expansion of
online education. The University has
openly embraced Coursera, an online
equcational medium that allows any-
one to take classes from prestigious
universities such as Stanford Uni-
versity, Princeton University, Brown
University and 31 other institutions,
including the University of Michi-
gan. According to Coursera's mission
statement, it wants to "empower peo-
ple with education that will improve
their lives, the lives of their families,
and the communities they live in."
So with all the hubbub surround-
ing online education, specifically
Coursera, I decided to give it a try.
Since Oct. 22, I've been enrolled in
"Principles of Obesity Economics,"
a class taught by Prof. Kevin Frick
from Johns Hopkins University.
While at first I only took the class
because it was four weeks long, I've
actually enjoyed the topic, as it tries
to answer the question of why the
United States suffers from an obesity
problem using an economic perspec-
tive. Every lecture has taught me
something that I didn't previously

know, which is really all I could have
expected.
Admittedly, I'm not as engaged
in the class as most of the other stu-
dents, and for good reason. I'm m col-
lege and many ofthem aren't.Ibarely
spend any time watching the posted
lectures and doing the quizzes, but
it looks like I'm going to get the 70
percent grade necessary to complete
the class. And there lies the problem
with Coursera and the online educa-
tion experience as a whole; it lacks
the demand for the critical thinking
that I crave.
There's no way online educa-
tion can fully replace the traditional
classroom setting. While my instruc-
tor has set up a discussion forum
where students can converse and
talk about the subject, it certainly
doesn't compare to the passionate
debates that go on in my English 125
class at the University. The neatly
produced PowerPoint presentations
my instructor posts aren't nearly as
intriguing as Prof. Brian Coppola in
organic chemistry.
There's no doubt in my mind that
online education serves a purpose
by giving more people an opportP-
nity to learn, and I think any chance
to improve your intelligence should
never be wasted. But I want to make
the point that there's something to

be said for the human element, espe-
cially in an academic setting. I'm not
denouncing the value of an online
education, but I'm skeptical of the
idea that an individual who earned a
bachelor's degree online could com-
pete with someone who did the same
on a physical campus.
I have no regrets over my Coursera
experience. It has been fascinatingto
learn information in a different way.
But it has made me rethink the pur-
pose of an education. Is it ultimately
for monetary gains? Or is it to help
improve society? I've concluded that
it really doesn't matter. Because no
matter which choice you pick, rely-
ing on online education as a complete
education could be providing false
hope that we've actually learned
something.
President Barack Obama has
emphasized the importance of an
education in his first term and it cer-
tainly will be a focus of his second
term. But like anything, it must be
done responsibly. I recognize that
I'mpotentiallybiased because of how 1
privileged I am to attend this uni-
versity. But I'm convinced that if we
want to become smarter as nation,
we need to find ways to get people
into the classroom and off the couch.

Third time not the charm.
Crystal Castles
bleeps and bloops

too darkly to enjoy
By THOMAS KLEPACZ
For the Daily
Bleep Bloop. It's kind of a
genre, but not quite - more a cat-
egory of music classified by the
ever-enigmatic
Carles of Hip-
ster Runoff, the
sardonic king Crystal
of his own blog- Castles
ging universe.
Much like his , (I)
independently
coined Chill- Polymor
wave, a genre
formed after the explosive rise
of laconic bands like Washed Out
and Real Estate, Carles estab-
lished Bleep Bloop following the
similarly rapid rise of the "elec-
tronically experimental" (as
determined by some Wikipedia
contributor) Crystal Castles.
While Carles may have con-
stantly poked fun at the Cana-
dian duo, the pair had true
musical merit - they were cre-
ating melodic, expertly crafted
Bleep Bloop, a soundtrack to
some form of effervescent, heav-
enly arcade. Simply put, it was
beautiful.
Sadly, Caries may finally be
justified in his constant Bleep
Bloop mockery. Crystal Castles's
third album, candidly titled (III),
is not only sonically irritating, but
it's almost embarrassing to the
blossoming electronic genre.
Unlike the graceful beauty
which came along with the
groups' last "bleeps" (see "Magic
Spells"), many of the songs on
(III) are grotesquely arranged
- a collective nightmare of

Talk about getting socked in the head!
"bloops." Whereas the music of
(II) may have transported you to
an empyrean arcade, (III) leaves
you feeling hopeless and dis-
turbed - trapped in a dark arcade
on a never-ending bad trip.
Songs like "Plague" begin
withsomewhat promising melo-
dies, only to slowly transform
into macabre-infused arrange-
ments of stuttering synth' and
shrill yelps. "Insulin," on the
other hand, never has any hope:
it begins with ominous bass,
ends with ominous bass, and
centers itself around distorted
guitars and more screaming.
If a car wreck were a song, this
would be it.
Some tracks on (III) are frus-
trating purely in musical arrange-
ment - songs like "Kerosene" and
"Violent Youth" would be great,.
if not only for some questionable
sonic decisions. "Kerosene," for
example, begins with looming
synth, a sound best supplanted by
simple drums and subtle samples.

However, Ethan Kath (the man
behind Crystal Castles's pro-
duction) introduces a bouncing,
reverberating vocal sample best
likened to the aggravating sound
of rewinding an old cassette.
On "Violent Youth," Kath splat-
ters shrill, disorderly, Care Bear-
like vocals over a tremendously
simple Bleep-Bloopbase. The con-
coction of sounds transforms each
track from "song" to "noise" -
from melody to barely listenable
bursts of uneven energy. Resisting
the double arrows of the skip but-
ton becomes increasingly difficult
as each track develops.
When the duo breaks out of
soundtracks for harrowing disas-
ters and bad trips, they actually
show some promise: tracks such
as "Wrath of God" and "Child I
Will Hurt You" (disregard the
names) are spacely and hyp-
notic: psychedelic in a good way.
"Transgender" is slightly awk-
ward, but surprisingly easy to
listen to in a trance-y sort of way..

Basically, it'd be good to play for
some Molly-d out crowd.
Sure, Crystal Castles took a
darker turn with (III). It's obvi-
ous from the get-go - song titles
such as "Pale Flesh," "Sad Eyes"
and "Violent Youth" all attest
to the group's attempt at a more
ominous image. However, dark-
ness can be done gracefully,
and the Canadian duo come off
sounding more Skrillex than
Shlohmo (whose "Crew Love"
remix is the perfect example of
dark done right).
Whether they wanted to dis-
tance themselves from their.
musical past or draw themselves
closer to the dubstep-esque pop-
ularity of today is unclear, but
nonetheless, the duo falls into
some no-man's land of barely lis-
tenable chaos. The Bleep Bloop
days of Crystal Castles's melan-
cholic past are seemingly gone
with (III), and gosh darn it, Car-
les is finally right. Crystal Castles
does seem like kind of a joke.

Agulera s musical experiment
doesn't bloom on new 'Lotus'

By GREGORY HICKS
Daily.Arts Writer
Lotus is an improvement, but
it's not Christina Aguilera. It's
not the teenage pop star who
had three No. 1
singles off an
R&B, soul-style
album. It's not Chnstina
the half-naked
Xtina who AgUilera
wanted a genu- Lotus
inely "Dirrty"
hip-hop record. RCA
And it's most
certainly not a full-blown 1920s
throwback that still managed to
generate hits in 2006.
That's when 2010 reared its
ugly head, with the failure of
Bionic knocking the confidence
right out of Aguilera. The off-the-
beaten-path music disappeared
and has now been replaced with
the play-it-safe sound ofLotus.
'The album is, musically
speaking, a step up from Bionic,
but even that flop of a record had
the stylistic consistency expect-
ed of Aguilera. Lotus might have
catchier tunes, but it's the same
messy production of every other
pop artist nowadays. "Red Hot
Kinda Love" sounds like a mix
of the '20s Back to Basics style
and the futuristically unfriendly
noise of Bionic, making it diffi-
cult to pinpoint the track's musi-
cal genre.
The ballads have no stylistic
confusion, but are rather boring,
seemingly thrown in to give the
appearance of musical sophisti-
cation - though "Blank Page" is
a pleasantly uplifting track that's
melodically similar to her 2002
hit "Beautiful." She can thank
award-winning songwriter Sia
for writing this new potential hit.

This is why we can't have nice things.
The "Lotus Intro" is one of
the more distinct tracks on the
album. The mystical synths, the
echoed "Wayayaya" s sung in
the background and the foreign
percussion drumming create a
spiritual dance atmosphere that
seems well suited to Aguilera's
musical rebirth message. If only
any of the other songs on the
album resembled this intro. The
record would've beentied togeth-
er nicely and a worthy listen.
And then there are the Max
Martin-written tracks. If there's
one thing everyone should real-
ize at this point, it's that Martin
needs to take his $250 million
net worth and stop writing music.
"Your Body" was such a dull track
that it couldn't even chart higher
than Christina's lead single on
Bionic, "Not Myself Tonight."
Having the most anticipated sin-
gle of the year barely squeezing
its way into the Top-40 is pitiful.

'Daughter' doesn't
'dig deep enough
French film depicts
one-dimensional
view of country life

By NATALIE GADBOIS
Daily Arts Writer
Films can at times be intensely
enjoyable without actually being
good. This is the case for "The
Well Digger's
Daughter" a
lushly simple *
story of love The Well
and pride set in
the pre-World Digger's
War II French Daughter
countryside.
The film excels At the -
in its bucolic Michigan
cinematogra- Kins Lorber
phy and classic
tale of broken
hearts, but this simplicity is far
too one-dimensional and arche-
typal to provide any real merit.
Daniel Auteuil ("The Look-
out") directs and stars as Pascal
Amoretti, an uneducated well
digger who thrives on his pride
for his eldest daughter and his
antiquated sense of honor. Wid-
owed years before and left to
raise six daughters by himself,
the resolutely masculine Pascal
relies heavily on Patricia (Astrid
Berges-Frisbey, "The Pirates
of the Caribbean: -On Stranger
Tides"), his ingenuously sweet
18-year-old daughter, to handle
the "womenfolk" duties.
Of course, according to stan-
dard, Patricia is the beauty of the
county, a fact that does not go
unnoticed by Pascal or Jacques,
the debonair and devilish rich boy
(Nicolas Duvauchelle, "Polisse").
Jacques gets Patricia pregnant
(gasp!) and then is abruptly sent
off the war. The loving farewell
note he entrusts his arrogant
mother to give to Patricia is cru-
elly burned, al a"The Notebook."
The film falters here, as these
promising characters in this beau-
tifully transparent setting never
fully form and quickly delineate
into stereotypes. Patricia is the
guileless, naive ingenue, Jacques

daddy, Pasqual is the loving but
unyielding father who can't for-
give his daughter. This story has
been done before, and despite its
surface charms, falls flat.
Many complex issues are
touched on, but never analyzed
at a deeper level. Director Auteuil
scratches at the striking class dif-
ferences between Jacques's pre-
tentious "town" family and the
Amoretti's simple hardworking
ways, but never strengthens the
line beyond rich vs. poor, mon-
ocle-wearing rich guy vs. dirt-
spattered working man.
Similarly, Patricia is heavily
ostracized, in particular by her
own father, for bearing a bastard
child, while Jacques remains free
and clear with no responsibility.
Sadly, Auteuil does not allow us
to enter her head and understand
the deep pain and loneliness she
must feel. Instead the film sinks
into melodrama, pinning Patricia
as the love-addled sobbing young
mother and Pascal as her bluster-
ing and corpulent master.
The best parts of this film are
the few subdued moments, when
the characters are allowed simply
to be, and not to take on a grandi-
ose paradigm. When Pascal and
Patricia stand in their simple
kitchen, and she tells him in a few
agonizing words of her condition,
there is an honest understanding

between them that eloquently
rises above the melodrama. In
these lucid scenes, the sweeping
yet placid beauty of the Provence
landscape is most evident and the
Amorettis seem most at peace
in their quiescent world. More
than anything else Pascal is a
man of great pride, and in these
scenes it's apparent why - he's
an uncomplicated man who's
unburdened with great intel-
ligence, but he reigns over his
small pastoral world with equal
honor'and love.
Unfortunately, these moments
are easily lost in the loud and
unnecessary plot traps that
become gradually larger and less
relatable as the film progresses.
This story is rarely ambiguous or
subtle, so every action is either
inconsequential or grand and life
altering.
The love story loses its inti-
macy, Pascal abruptly contradicts
the very edicts he stood by so
strongly at the beginning of the
film, and Patricia never seems to
gain wisdom despite her great tri-
als. Though there is much beauty
to be found in the decisive simplic-
ity of the film, in the end it only
becomes redundant. "The Well
Digger's Daughter" had the poten-
tial to be a nuanced, crystalizing
film, but instead it falls trap to the
archetypal stories of love and loss
that we've grown bored of.

38-year-old man approaching
his expiration date and not really
knowing what to do about it.
O'Brien's disability has con-
fined him to the realm of his
observation, and, as a result, what
he writes is consistently heart-
felt. He's forced to acknowledge
the amenities because the scope
of his vision is narrowed. Poetry,
for O'Brien, becomes a serious
method of articulating detailed
reactions and appreciations. The
overlying voice narrative - that
of O'Brien's - expounds on the
notion of his near-omnipresence,

First-year captain Treais
leads nation in goals scored

Michigan earns first-
round home matchup,
hosts Purple Eagles

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
In the first game of the Michi-
gan hockey team's series with
Northern Michigan two weeks
ago, senior forward A.J. Treais
was the hero when he notched a
goal with six-tenths of a second
left, sending the game into over-
time.
And after the overtime period
turned into a shootout, Treais
was the only player for either
team to score on his penalty
shot. The lone goal completed an
improbable comeback, after the
Wolverines scored three third-
period goals to send the game to
overtime.
Though they left Marquette
with just two points, Treais' two
goals and one assist on the week-
end were critical to the little
success they found in the Upper
Peninsula.
"You can tell when A.J. shoots
the puck, he shoots to score,"
said Michigan coach Red Beren-
son after Michigan's 4-3 loss to
Northern Michigan. "We're not
getting shots like that from any-
one else."
This past weekend, Treais'
hot streak continued during the
Wolverines home-and-home
series with. Michigan State. In
Michigan's 5-1 victory on Friday
night in Ann Arbor, he tallied
two assists, for a total of five on
the year. A day later, when the
Wolverines were throttled 7-2
by the Spartans, the Bloomfield
Hills, Mich. native notched his
eighth goal of the season.
Treais' high numbers aren't
a big surprise either. Last sea-
son he finished with 42 points,
putting him tied for second, just
one point shy of then-freshman
forward Alex Guptill. His cur-
rent pace sets him on target to
finish the regular season with
52 points.,
"He's been a stud," said
senior defenseman Lee Moffie.
"I've been in his class and seen
his skill set and his talent in the
past three years and it's always

Wolverines make
NCAA Tourney
in Daley's debut
season at the helm
By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's soccer
team may have missed out on
a Big Ten Tournament title on
Sunday, but Monday was a new
day and surely a better one for
the Wolverines.
The NCAA selection commit-
tee announced Monday evening
that Michigan (3-2-1 Big Ten,
10-9-1 overall) would receive an
at-large bid to the NCAA Tour-
nament, ensuring that all was
not lost following the bitter 2-1
overtime defeat to Michigan
State in Evanston. Better yet, the
Wolverines are slated to host the
first-round tournament match
against Niagara (6-1-1 MAAC,
13-1-4) on Thursday at 7 p.m. at
the U-M Soccer Complex..
A home game is crucial for the

Wolverines, as they will havethe
rabid Michigan Ultras at their
backs, starving for a victory
after making the trip from Ann
Arbor to Evanston for the disap-
pointing Big Ten final.
"The Ultras are the best," said
Michigan coach Chaka Daley.
"Hopefully we can get them in
full force for the first match and
then see if we can get going (in
the tournament)."
The Wolverines and the
Purple Eagles have never met.
Michigan is in the NCAA Tour-
nament for the first time since its
prolific run to the College Cup
semifinals in 2010, where they
lost 2-1 to to eventual champion
Akron, and are delighted to have
a shot at the postseason. The
Zips await the Wolverines in the
second round should Michigan
advance.
The Wolverines hold a 7-4
all-time record in the tourna-
ment, having yet to lose a first-
round match in progtam history.
Michigan will look to continue
that trend as the squad begins
to prepare this week for a highly
anticipated postseason:

PAUL SHEPMAN/Daily
Senior forward and team captain A.J. Treais leads the nation with eight goals early in the 20t2-t3 season.

been there. You've seen flashes
of it in the past when he gets
hot. It just seems like right now
he's putting it all together and
he's leading this team by exam-
ple and it's been pretty special
to watch."
As of Monday, Treais is tied
for second in points in the
CCHA, behind only Miami
(Ohio) freshman standout Riley
Barber. However, his average of
.89 goals per game is .29' more
than anybody else in the con-
ference. He has averaged 1.44
points per game, which is also
good enough for the conference
lead.
And he attributes his success
this season to a new mindset.
"I guess just putting pucks on
net and not being too unselfish,"
he said. "In years past, I always
made the extra pass and this
year I'm trying to put pucks on
net. I figure if I put five shots
on net a game, hopefully one of
them will go in."
They have been going in,

and not only does he lead the
CCHA in both points per game
and goals per game, but he leads
the entire NCAA in goals scored
and goals per game. His offen-
sive production has foreshad-
owed the success of the entire
offense, as the team's 3.50 goals
per game in conference play are
tied with Notre Dame for first.
"I think (he) gives our offense
a leader," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "Our offense
has been pretty good and that's
important. But look where we
are. We're a .500 team. ...A.J.
is doing what he can do, but we
have to be better defensively."
Berenson has stressed the
defensive issues - especially
during the Wolverines last four
games where they have allowed
20 goals - are not just a result
of poor play from the defen-
semen, but also the forwards
keeping track of their men and
maintaining a strong forecheck.
Despite the forward corps
defensive struggles, Treais'

flurry of early season points
might be due to his new found
duty of running the point on
the power play. After junior
defenseman Jon Merrill was
sidelined Oct. 9 with an injured
vertebrae during the Wolver-
ines' exhibition with Windsor,
Treais has had to fill in on the
point. His two power play goals
are a direct result of his new job
and success he's had.
Prior to this season, Treais
had always been a quiet con-
tributor for a Michigan team
that was never short of strong
leadership - forward Luke
Glendening wore the captain'
s 'C' the previous two seasons
during his junior and senior
campaigns. When Treais was
named team captain this off-
season, he was thrust into a
leadership role that had been
unfamiliar to him.
"He's .been unbelievable this
year, and he's the most valuable
player on the team for us right
now," Moffie said.

Wolverines ease past Xavier in first road contest

After getting off to a slow start,

ond half Monday to defeat host
Xavier, 62-53. In first-year coach
Kim Barnes Arico's second game,
the Wolverines shot 41.8 percent.
from the field but gave up 13 turn-
overs in their first game away
from the Crisler Center.
"I think
we came MICHIGAN 62
out with a XAVIER 53
lot of ener-
gy," said senior forward Rachel
Sheffer. "At times we were a little
quiet, but once we got comfort-
able and focused on ourselves is
when we really started playing
well."
Sheffer led Michigan on
offense with 18 points and four
assists, making 7-of-14 from the
field and 2-of-3 from 3-point
range. Senior guard Kate Thomp-
son followed suit with 14 points
while making 4-of-7 3-point-
ers. Thompson was especially
dominant in the post, where
she grabbed six rebounds and
blocked four shots. Sophomore
guard Brenae Harris led the team
with seven rebounds while con-
tributing nine points.
"(Kate) did a really great job
of affecting their shots and get-
ting some blocks, and (she) really
helped us inside," Barnes Arico
said. "She has great length."
The Musketeers took advan-
tage of Michigan's missed
attempts earlyinthe game, build-
ing a 7-3 lead to open the game.
The Wolverines countered with a
13-8 run, led by three of Thomp-
son's four shots from beyond the
arc. Xavier junior guard Shatyra
Hawkes' 3-pointer at the end of
the half brought the Musketeers
within five going into halftime.
"I thought we really shot the
ball well in the first half," Barnes

Arico said. "I thought we really
played well and we were only up
by five. That was actually a little
concerning for me at halftime."
Michigan enlarged its lead in
the second half with a boost from
Harris' 3-point play, followed by
a fourth ttiple from Thompson.
Harris' lay-up with 8:43 remain-
ing put the Wolverines ahead by
a game-high 15 points, but Xavier
continued to fire back. The Mus-
keteers were able to cut the lead
to within seven with less than
two minutes to play, but senior
guard Jenny Ryan knocked down
two clutch free throws to seal the
victory.
"I think we stick together
as a team really well," Thomp-

son said. "They kept it close the
whole game and we were able to
make it out with a nice win."
While Michigan was persis-
tent in refusing to let Xavier back
into the game, the Wolverines
gave away seven of their 13 turn-
overs in the first half.
To add to its first half woes,
Michigan was outrebounded
18-13 in the first 20 minutes of
play.
"There were times that they
definitely out-muscled us on the
boards, and there were some that
we had in our hands and we just
didn't finish the play," Sheffer
said. "But I think overall we came
out with a win, so that's really all
that matters at this point."

Senior forward Rachel Sheffer had 18 points and four assists against Xavier in Cincinnati on Monday night.

Michigan blitzes JUPUL

MEN'S BASKETBALL
'M' advances to 2nd
round of NIT Tip-Off

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
For the first 20 minutes of
Monday night's game, the Michi-
gan men'sbasketball team looked
like it was still basking in its sea-
son-opening victory over Slip-
pery Rock on Friday.
The Wolverines looked lead--
footed on
defense IUPUi 54
and they MICHIGAN 91
settled for
the outside shot on offense, let-
ting Indiana University-Purdue
University Indianapolis stay
within four points for the major-
ity of the first half. At times,
IUPUI was simply playing hard-
er than the Wolverines, especial-
ly on defense.
But with three seconds
remaining before halftime, soph-
omore guard Trey Burke stole
the ball and took it to the rim,
getting fouled in the process - a
defensive effort that was a rare
occurrence in the first half. He
sank the two free throws and
gave the fifth-ranked Wolverines
some momentum going into half-
time.
And it showed. Freshman for-
ward Glenn Robinson III nailed a
3-pointer on Michigan's first pos-
session of the second half, sopho-
more guard Trey Burke made a
layup in transition 30 seconds
later, and the Wolverines defeat-
ed IUPUI in the first round of the
NIT Season Tip-off, 91-54.
"The first half, there were
some moments (where) I thought
we were goingto be ina long bat-
tle," said Michigan coach John
Beilein.
"They were shooting the ball
well and guarding us well -
putting pressure on us that we
hadn't seen yet. Once we got
accustomed to it, we were fine.
Early, we had some adjustments
we had to make, just personally,
to get ready for that type of pres-
sure."

With a 91-54 victory over
IUPUI on Monday night, the
Michigan basketball team moved
on to the second round of the 2012
NIT Season Tip-Off, matching up
against Cleveland State on Tues-
day.
The winner of Tuesday's
game will earn a coveted spot
in the semifinal round of the
tournament,
which takes
place in New CleVeland
York's Madison Stat
Square Garden
next week. Michigan

Bowling Green, Center
79-73. Cleve-
land State was TV:
led by forward ESPN2
Tim Kamczyc,
who scored 21 points to go along
with seven rebounds. The Vikings
also got a big game from forward
Mason Marlin, who notched a
double-double with 11 points and
13 rebounds.
Even with the performances of
the Cleveland State forwards on
Monday, Tuesday figures to have
a heavy emphasis on the back-
courts of each team.
Cleveland State's leadingscorer
is 5-foot-9 sophomore pointguard
Charlie Lee, who plays along-
side sophomore guard Sebastian
Douglas. Together, the duo has,
averaged 30 points per game so
far this season, which is more
than a third of the team's total
points. And it's not just points
- as a team, the Vikings have 37
assists on the season, 17 of which,
belongto Lee.
It's hard to make a straight-
up backcourt comparison with
the Wolverines (2-0) since they
technically start four guards, but
the main positional battles will
be with whatever two of the four

guards are tasked with guarding
Lee and Douglas.
Those two guards could be
sophomore Trey Burke and fresh-
man Glenn Robinson III, who
could both have stopped playing
at halftime on Monday and had
big games. When the first half
ended, Burke and Robinson had
a combined 29 of Michigan's 454
points, and Burke had seven of
Michigan's nine assists.
Burke ended up setting a
career-high with nine assists to
go along with his 22 points, while
Robinson scored 21 points on
8-of-9 shooting from the field and
3-for-3 shooting from beyond the
arc.
Tuesday still presents the pos-
sibility of a trap game for several
reasons for Michigan, the biggest
of which being that the Wolver-
ines will play back-to-back games
for the first time this season.
Michigan won't have its usual
rest days, which means fatigue
could be a factor, but perhaps
more importantly, it means Mich-
igan won't have its usual prepara-
tion days.
"You've been practicing hard
and you have two teams going, but
the carrot of New York City wait-
ing for the winner will hopefully
get enough people through it,"
said Michigan coach John Beilein.
"Both Michigan and Cleveland
State have to be very careful
tomorrow about how long people
play because two games back-to-
back, nobody is used to that."
For a team that has played
sharper and with more energy in
the second half than in the first
half for every exhibition and game
this season, losing that prepara-
tion day could be big tomorrow.
"Just trying to finish strong
as hard as we can, and I think
we just need to do a better job of
having that intensity the whole
game," said junior guard Tim
Hardaway Jr. "It's kind of hard
for both teams to get going in the
first half, the anxieties are there,
so just trying to do a good job of
having that momentum going the
whole game."

Freshman forward Glenn Robinson II scored 21 points in the Wolverines victory on Monday

early in the game with screens
and beatcits zone by making extra
passes to open shooters. And at
one point in the second half, the
Wolverines were caught on their
back foot as IUPUI broke into a
three-on-one fast break.
"Credit to IUPUI, they did a
great job of getting us uncom-
fortable at the beginning of the
game," said junior guard Tim
Hardaway, Jr. "They did a great
job of breaking us down. That's
one thing that we really need to
focus on on the defensive end
- once the team is breaking us
down, we have to do a great job
of just staying mature and mov-
ing on to the next play. Justbeing
able to adapt to their offense and
get a little more reps throughout
the game, we really caught on to
what they're doing.

"I think we just did a great job
of making plays down the stretch
and throughout the game to get
better looks - that's just the
maturity of this team."
Michigan also struggled to
control the ball, coughing it up
13 times, but it allowed just seven
points off of turnovers. IUPUI
played tenacious defense in the
first half, and the Wolverines just
didn't have energy.
But the offense stole the show.
Shots were falling for the Wol-
verines all game as they have
been all season - Michigan hit
60 percent of its field goals and
went 13-for-21 from beyond the
arc in Monday's game.
Burke led the Wolverines,
scoring 22 points and dishing
nine assists, and Robinson tal-
lied 21 points on 8-for-9 shooting

- he was perfect from the field
until the six-minute mark of the
second half.
With a slew of terrific shoot-
ers, the Wolverines saw five
players in double digits - fresh-
man guard Nik Stauskas had 11,
and redshirt junior forward Jor-
dan Morgan and Hardaway, Jr.
tossed in 10 - and had plenty of
contribution off the bench. The
reserves had 28 points, and the
bench was almost cleared, except
for freshman guard Caris LeVert,
with three minutes left in the
game.
"I don't think this year our
problem will be scoring," Burke
said. "That's just the reality ofthe
situation. (But) the defensive side
is something that we're work-
ing towards ... I think that's one
thing we need to mature on."

WOMEN'S SOCCER
Depth plays key
role in NCAAs

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
Entering the 2012 season, it
was no secret that one of the most
valuable- assets the Michigan
women's soccer team possessed
was its depth.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan
frequently said he was looking .
forward to playing17or 18 players
every game, trying to take advan-
tage of his deep bench as much as
possible.
"I think we are going to be able
to run teams off the park because
we've got so much talent and so
much depth," Ryan said in early
September. "We're talented and
fast and skillfulatceveryposition."
And against Central Michigan
on Saturday, the importance of
the bench to the Wolverines' suc-
cess could not have been more
clear. Though

pewa reserves, who contributed
just one shot in109 minutes.
And in the extra period, it was
play from the reserves that cre-
ated scoring opportunities and
set up the victory. Just minutes
into overtime, Jaffe dribbled deep
into Central Michigan territory to,
set up Ezurike for an easy game-
winning score.
"I've got to give credit to our
players that came off the bench,"
Ryan said. "Our depth tonight
was huge."
SCARY MOMENT: Early in the
second half, junior midfielder Tori
McCombs went up for aheader on
the Wolverines' side of the pitch

moment for Michigan. Contest-

Daily Sports Editor
Perhaps the final chapter of
Denard Robinson's Michigan
career has already come to a
close.
The storybook narrative
began four years ago at Michi-
gan Stadium, in front of a sea of
109,910 in the most storied build-
ing in college football, And it
began with a rookie mistake, one
that birthed the legend of No. 16
as one of college football's most
electric quarterbacks.
Robinson muffed his first snap
in a winged helmet. He hurriedly
picked the ball off the turf, sped
right and weaved through the
Western Michigan defense for a
43-yard touchdown.
You might remember his last
appearance at the Big House.
It, too, saw the ball on the turf.
But that was only because Rob-
inson's emphatic spike put the
Wolverines in position to topple
Michigan State on a chilly Octo-
ber night for the first time in four
years.
It may have been Robinson's
last appearance as quarterback
at Michigan Stadium. Robin-

son's nagging ulnar-nerve injury
has kept him out of consecutive
games and the coaching staff
remains mum as to Robinson's
.status or whether he is practic-
ing, saying only that he is "day-
to-day."
Meanwhile, the Michigan
offense hasn't slowed, guided by
the steady hands of junior back-
up quarterback Devin Gardner.
Robinsonhas participated lightly
in warm-ups, but has traded in
his helmet for a trucker cap and
headset on the sideline.
"(Robinson has) been a great
leader," said Michigan coach
Brady Hoke. "I mean, he's been a
terrific leader."
With the senior class of Michi-
gan's 'Team 133' facing its final
home game on Saturday against
Iowa, it's becoming increasingly
apparent that Robinson may not
get another snap in the stadium
that made him famous.
"Everybody wants to go out
the way they dreamed coming
into Michigan," said fifth-year
senior offensive guard Patrick
Omameh. "But however things
unfold, it's out of our hands. We
just have to play the hand we've
been dealt and keep moving for-

ward.",
Robinson is Michigan's all-
time leader in total offensive
yardage and one of just eight
players in college football his-
tory to compile 40 rushing and
40 passing touchdowns in their
career. Hoke recognized that
while Robinson has "made a
mark" at Michigan, missing
the tail end of his senior season
would be devastating.
"I think anytime a guy can't
finish, because of injury or what-
ever, you're disappointed," Hoke
said.
Hoke has not ruled out the
possibility of using Robinson at
a different position if his injury
should continue to keep him out
of action at quarterback. He was
on the field for one kick return
earlier in the fall, but, for now,
he's Michigan's biggest cheer-
leader from the sideline - and
that's a title he's held for some
time now.
"He's a source of encourage-
ment," Omameh said. "He's the
kind of guy who whatever he can
do for the team, no matter what
capacity it is, he'll tryto do it"
Robinson has indisputably
been the face of Michigan foot-

ball for the past three .seasons
since he took over for Tate Forci-
er at quarterback. That attentidn
was unnatural for the soft-spo-
ken Robinson, a native of Deer-
field Beach, Fla., but he's grown
into the role.
"Denard's a guy that has
thrust himself into the talk of
some of the greats at the Uni-
versity of Michigan," said senior
defensive end Craig Roh. "He's
been a guy since day one that's
been a huge factor in everything
that we've done. Just the day-to-
day energy that he brings - I've
almost never seen him in a bad
mood."
Roh joked that while Rob-
inson's energy is contagious,
"sometimes it's annoying." Even
in the last two weeks since
Robinson was injured against
Nebraskahis moodhasn'tdamp-
ened.
"(His attitude) really hasn't
changed," Roh said. "He really
hasn'tchanged at all. The guy is a
team player, when you really get
down to it.
"It's great to see that someone
is always able to keep coming
back again and again with that
great positive attitude he has."
