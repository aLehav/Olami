Santorum wins
in three states,
Gingrich takes Ga.
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt
Romney narrowly beat out former
Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum
in the key swing state of Ohio yes-
terday as Republicans in 10 states
took to the polls as the contest for
the Republican presidential nomi-
nation continued.
In the split night of the Super
Tuesday contests, Romney won five
states and Santorum won three,
extending Romney's lead in del-
egateswhile alsoreinvigoratingthe
campaigns of Santorum and former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
According to University professors,
last night's contests denied any
of the candidates the chance for a
decisive turn in the race, and the
results could prolong the contest
even longer.
Romney scored decisive victo-
ries in Massachusetts - where he
formerly served as governor - Vir-
ginia, Vermont and Idaho. Santo-
rum won North Dakota, Tennessee
and Oklahoma, while in Ohio - a
so-called bellwether state due to its
close political divisions - Romney

defeated Santorum by a margin of
38 percent to 37 percent.
Results in Alaska were not yet
reported as of 2:30 a.m.
At a rally in Steubenville, Ohio,
Santorum said he was "ready to win
across this country."
"It's clear. We've won races all
over this country against the odds,"
Santorum said.
"When they
thought, 'Oh, OK,
he's finally fin-
ished,' we keep
coming back. We Mil
are in this thing."
Santorum appeared to gain
momentum after three consecutive
victories in Colorado, Missouri and
Minnesota last month, which was
stifled following losses in Maine,
Michigan, Arizona and Washing-
ton. Last night's wins are his first
since his successes in early Febru-
ary.
Michael Heaney, an assistant
professor of political science, said
Santorum performed well and
regained some momentum from
Romney with his strong victories
in the South and his challenge to
Romney in Ohio.
"I'm not sure I'd call Santorum a
loser," Heaney said. "I mean, San-
torum looks quite strong. He per-
formed quite well in Ohio."
However, Heaney declared the

By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Central Student Govern-
ment welcomed University
Provost Philip Hanlon to
a joint session at its meet-
ing last night, where he
addressed the Assembly
and the University Council
on rising tuition and the
University's budget.
Hanlon joined Martha
Pollack, the University's
vice provost for academic
and budgetary affairs, in
clarifying confusion on
funding allocation at the
University in an effort
to increase transparency
on issues such as tuition
costs. CSG members also
discussed next month's
elections and passed reso-
lutions that increase its
budget for this semester

to provide funding for stu-
dents to attend a hearing
today in Cincinnati, which
will determine the consti-
tutionality of using race
as a factor in admissions
at universities around the
state.
Hanlon told CSG mem-
bers that he came to share
specifics of the budget sys-
tem, and express the desire
of University officials to
help finance the education
of students from around
the nation.
"(I want to) give (CSG)
an understanding of the
budget, an understanding
of what's driving costs up
- their cost of attendance,"
Hanlon said. "Let them
know we're concerned
about it, let them know
we're working on it."
Hanlon specifically
noted that many students
are unaware that the Uni-
versity of Michigan Health
System and the Athletic
Department are funded

versity's academic depart-

Students face-off with Adidas rep.

Group engages in
terse debate over
laid-off workers
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
In a tense half-hour session
yesterday, University students
met with an Adidas representa-
tive in a forum focused on the
company's refusal to provide
severance to the 2,800 workers

who recently lost their jobs at a
factory in Indonesia.
The factory, PT Kizone, spe-
cifically manufactured apparel
adorned with the University's
logo and was closed down in
January 2011. Adidas holds a
$60 million contract with the
University. Though the compa-
ny declined to provide any pay
or benefits after the termination
of its workers, other companies
who also had a contract with
the factory, including Nike, paid
part of the workers' severance.

The students that met with the
representative expressed dis-
content with Adidas' refusal to
pay the severance, noting that
the act breached the code of
conduct that Adidas has with
University.
After the handful of students
in attendance finished asking
questions, the meeting conclud-
ed when Gregg Nebel, head of
social and environmental affairs
for Adidas in the Americas, was
asked to leave. LSA junior Mon-

Activism and education

Michigan Helping Hands, a
new campus organization that
promotes education and activ-
ism on social issues affecting
Michigan and the United States,
is working daily to inform local
communities about prevalent
issues like homelessness, poverty
and hunger.
Founded by LSA freshmen
Joshua Kleiman and Alex Lieber-
man, the duo said they were
inspired to create the group dur-
ing high school, and decided to
bring the idea to campus this
year. Creating an organization
was their method of stimulat-
ing student involvement to com-
bat issues in the community and
inspire change, they said.

"Michigan Helping Hands has
three goals - spreading aware-
ness, raising money and involve-
ment," Kleiman said.
Each year, members will learn
about various issues and vote on a
topic to pursue in depth over the
course of the year. Kleiman and
Lieberman said they will encour-
age students at the University
to participate in volunteer trips,
fundraisers and a host of other
activities, adding that they hope
to influence students on other
college campuses as well.
"Everyone has a voice and
there are opportunities to learn
about everything, even (for)
members (of the group)," Klei-
man said.

Lieberman said the group
emphasizes an important set
of values and skills that can be
applied to various areas in life.
For the upcoming fall semes-
ter, both Kleiman and Lieberman
said they hope to remain active
in the group, increase their mem-
bership at Festifall and encour-
age others to engage in social
issues and events.
Amid inevitable challenges in
gaining members and receiving
administrative support, Lieber-
man emphasized the group's
devotion to rallying communal
involvement and funding chari-
table events that students are
truly compassionate about.

Syrian government defiant

U.S. begins

Russia and China
BEIRUT (AP) - Syria's presi-
dent defied mounting inter-
national pressure to end the
year-old crackdown on an upris-
ing against him and said yester-
day le was determined to go on
fighting what he called "foreign-

After a powerful American

The United States said it is

Security Council resolution
demanding an end to violence in
Syria, first by government forces
and then by opposition fight-
ers. Russia and China, powerful
allies that have blocked a Secu-
rity Council resolution against
Syria, made clear they were
still standing by the regime in
Damascus.

night had been "convincingly
won by Romney." He said that
while Romney - who has main-
tained a substantial lead in the
delegate count from the start of
the GOP race - may not appeal to
the whole Republican Party, he is
the party's best candidate and is
now the clear frontrunner.
"Super Tuesday looks a lot like
what we've been seeing for the
last two months, which is Rom-
neyis not lovedby the Republican
Party but he is winning," Heany
said.
In Ohio, where Romney and
Santorum exchanged leads for
most of the night, Romney's nar-
row victory was hailed as a key
triumph over Santorum in a bat-
tleground state.
However, since Heaney said
Santorum was not eligible for del-
CH egates in some parts of the state
for legal reasons, he said Rom-
ney would win most of the state's
delegates, a fact more important
than either candidate winning
the popular vote.
"One candidate might win by

was effective in fostering discus-
sion on corruption in the work-
force.
"I think we got our point
across," he said. "I thinkwe dem-
onstrated that we understood
the issue and that we weren't just
goingto let it slide."
During the discussion, Nebel
and Shattuck disagreed over
what Adidas owed the affected
workers.
"We are morally taking on our
obligations," Nebel said. "You
guys are pulling out one thing
that is strictly the severance.
You're not looking at everything
else that's happening."
Shattuck disagreed, argu-
ing that severance is crucial to
understanding the issue.
Nebel said Adidas supports
the workers being paid their sev-
erance, but that ultimately PT
Kizone, not Adidas, is respon-
no matter who wins the popu-
lar vote," he said in an interview
last night, before Romney was
declared the winner early this
morning.
Though Romney won convinc-
ingly in Massachusetts and Vir-
ginia, Santorum fared well in the
southern states. Ken Kollman,
a professor of political science,
said Santorum's performance in
the South is a sign of the ongo-
ing search for an alternative to
Romney and of Santorum's abil-
ity to maintain momentum in
the race.
"I think Santorum is keeping
himself in the race, and it's a vic-
tory that he is the main alterna-
tive to Romney," Kollman said.
"He's going to stay in the race
for a long time, but he can't seem
to do a knockout punch."
Despite Santorum's persever-
ance, Kollman said Santorum's
persistent deficit in the delegate
count could become trouble-
some for him as Romney contin-
ues to accumulate delegates in
each subsequent primary.
"This is ultimately a race
about getting seats at the con-
vention," Kollman said. "He's
winning those, and he's got an
advantage there."
LSA junior Brian Koziara,

sible for the severance. He added
that since the factory's closure,
approximately 300 of the work-
ers have been rehired by other
Adidas suppliers and 950 total
have been reemployed. He noted
that Adidas is working on finding
jobs for the other workers with-
out jobs.
"(Adidas) funded an initiative
that is helping on out-place- *
ment services and occupational
training for the entrenched
workers," Nebel said. "They're
helping them find jobs, they're
helping them with training
opportunities."
Nebel also met with Universi-
ty President Mary Sue Coleman's
Advisory Committee on Labor
Standards and Human Rights
earlier in the morning. Shattuck,
who is a member of the commit-
tee also attended the meeting as
well.
external vice chair of the Uni-
versity's chapter of the Col-
lege Republicans, agreed with
Heaney that Super Tuesday was
a success for Romney because he
continued to add to his lead in
the delegate count. Koziara said
Romney's five wins re-estab-
lished him as the frontrunner in
the Republican race.
"Now that we're actually get-
ting into the contested part of
this, it's become all about the
delegates - who can actually
win the delegates," he said. "And
in that regard, Romney won the
night."
Even in states where San-
torum earned the majority of
delegates and the popular vote,
Koziara said the successes were
only "technically" wins for San-
torum because in every state,
except Georgia and Tennessee,
Romney gained a significant
portion of the delegates.
"I think for Santorum it's a lit-
tle bit of a hollow victory," Kozi-
ara said. "Technically he won
three states - pending results
in Alaska - but what Santo-
rum needs to do is not just win
states; he needs to stop Romney
from amassing delegates. And
he wasn't able to do that this eve-
ning."

Unions work to
protect collective
bargaining rights
A labor union coalition offi-
cially launched a broad campaign
yesterday that it says is aimed at
protecting collective bargain-
ing rights, including an attempt
to pre-empt a possible "right-to-
work" movement by Michigan
Republicans. '
Unions want to present the
proposed constitutional amend-
ment to voters in November. To
do that, supporters would have to
collect at least 322,609 valid voter
signatures.
The unions' "Protect Our Jobs"
campaign was launched less than
a week after United Auto Work-
ers President Bob King said a
Michigan coalition had agreed
to mount a petition drive aimed
at preventing lawmakers from
adopting right-to-work laws. It
turns out the campaign covers
much more ground than that.

Green Beret dies
in fire trying to

A decorated Green Beret leapt
from the second-story of his

save his two young daughters.
Firefighters recovered the
body of Chief Warrant Officer
* Edward Cantrell on the sec-
ond floor of his North-Carolina
home, not far from the remains
of 6-year-old Isabella and 4-year-
old Natalia.
"He never made it back out,"
said Debbie Tanna, spokeswom-
an for the Cumberland County
sheriff's office.
Cantrell's wife and the girl's
mother, Louise, also jumped from
the second floor. She was treated
and released from a Fayetteville
hospital for smoke inhalation. The
family dog, a Rottweiler named
Sasha, also survived the fire.

BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo

- Massive explosion
kills hundreds
Morticians stacked bodies two
to a tray at Brazzaville's main
morgue yesterday as state radio
reported at least 246 people had
died from two days of explosions
at an armory that catapulted
shells, rockets and other muni-
tions into a densely populated
area of the capital of the Repub-
lic of Congo.
Police said international fire-
fighters had brought the main
blaze under control by yesterday
morning, and prevented it from
spreading to a second munitions
depot just 100 yards (meters)
away. The second depot contains
even heavier-caliber weapons,
including Stalin's Organ mul-
tiple rocket launchers, a military
source said, requesting anonym-
ity because he was not autho-
rized to speak to reporters.
* It still was unclear whether
rescue efforts could start in ear-
nest, nearly three days after the
first blasts. The military source
said there were plans for the con-
trolled destruction of the muni-
tions in the second depot, which
likely will delay any attempts to
dig into the rubble to find pos-
sible survivors or bodies.

"They just had to claim medical
amnesty and they got out scot-
free. There's got to be a medical
reason."
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said he believes the cur-
rent policy has a greater chance
of being passed than former ver-
sions of the bill due to increased
Republican support.
"(Similar bills) used to pass
the Democratic House and then
die in the Republican Senate,"
Irwin said. "Now it's passed a
Republican house and it has a
Republican's name on the bill
... maybe the Senate will fol-
low their typical pattern of sup-
porting bills that are from their
party."

Irwin said he was pleased with
the passage of the bill, particu-
larly in its efforts to prioritize the
protection of the state's youth.
"Basically in the Legislature
today, we put public safety first
and punishment first," Irwin
said. "It's probably the first time
in my time here in Lansing where
we've passed a bill that I felt
unequivocally positive about."
Forlini said he doesn't cur-
rently know which Senate com-
mittee the bill will be referred
to, but noted that the committee
could be determined as early as
tomorrow, and he plans to testify
on its behalf.
LSA junior Aditya Sathi, vice .
speaker of the Student Assembly
of Central Student Government,
authored a CSG resolution in
support of medical amnesty that
was passed in January. He is also
an author of another resolution

in support of medical amnesty
that was passed by the Students
Association of Michigan, an orga-
nization comprised of 12 public
universities in the state, in addi-
tion to non-member schools Fer-
ris State University, Grand Valley
State University and the Univer-
sity of Michigan.
"I had no doubt in my mind
that it was going to happen, it was
just how soon it was going to hap-
pen," Sathi said. "I'm happy to see
that an issue that is seemingly
common sense in my mind passed
in the House with flying colors
with very little opposition."
Sathi said the bill's strong vic-
tory in the House has made him
hopeful that it will pass in the
Senate, adding that he would like
to attend the bill's committee
hearing.
"I will do my best to be there,"
he said.


SOCIAL MEDIA
From Page 1A
that she will work primarily with
Facebook and Twitter. Though
her job encompasses these forms
of social media, she said there is a
"social listening" side to the posi-
tion that comprises a larger part
of her duties.
"I'll be working on what the
'content that we're putting out
looks like, how we can make it
better, how we can make it more
cohesive," she said. "I do tweet
all day, it is part of my job, but I
do it while analyzing reams of
data and meeting with people."
The position, first announced
five months ago with an adver-
tised salary of between
$90,000 and $110,000, gar-
nered widespread interest from
the Ann Arbor community.
Though there was an exhaus-
tive search to fill the social media
director position, Lisa Rudgers,
the University's vice president
for global communications and
strategic initiatives, wrote in an
e-mail she was thrilled to bring
Miller aboard.
Rudgers cited Miller's work on
the Super Bowl adertisements for
Chevrolet featuring actor Rainn
Wilson and award-winning work
for the Kimberly-Clark Corpora-
tion as just some of the reasons
she will be a good fit for the job at
the University.
"She has 10 years of experi-
ence in communications and
social media as a writer, strate-
gist and brand manager," Rudg-
ers wrote. "Also, she has terrific

experience on the creative side
of the house doing digital and
broadcast content creation as
well as copywriting ... Jordan
has worked both as a newspaper
reporter and an ad agency pro-
fessional, and is uniquely situ-
atedto bring a social media focus
to the many aspects of University
communications efforts."
Michael Limbert, the creative
director at Goodby Silverstein
& Partners was Miller's col-
league when she worked at the
advertisement firm. He wrote
in an e-mail that Millerwas an
impressive person to work with.
"While working at GSP, Jor-
dan helped elevate several of our
projects from read-only to must-
share," Limbert said. "She was
one of those shining individuals
here who pushed hard for social
relevancy and authenticity in
everything that came her way."
Miller said the ability to have
a conversation with and connect
to the University's audience
is one of the most important
aspects of social media and is
crucial to the University's image
as a whole.
"It's not about the platform,
it's more about interacting with
your community and getting
your message out and hearing
what they have to say back,"
she said. "It's looking at social

so many other ways, we can
and should be a ground-breaker
and a thought-leader in social
media," she said. "We should be
a school that other schools can
look to and say 'That's how the
University of Michigan's doing
it. They're doing it right and
that's how we should be doing it
too.'
Miller added: "I have a lot of
experience with creating a high-
quality product that is of a level
that can be disseminated global-
ly. I know that that's something
that we're going to be trying to
do here, to really raise the bar
on what we're doing content-
wise."
Rudgers also noted the impor-
tance of social media on a global
scale that makes the new posi-
tion such a necessity.
"We want to become higher
ed leaders in the social media
space as we work to advance
our global reputation," Rudgers
wrote. "Social media growth
has exploded in recent years
... Both in the U.S. and glob-
ally, social media channels have
become critical not only to the
dissemination of information
but to a vibrant engagement -
and conversation - with stake-
holders."

ments.
"The general fund budget
never supports auxiliary fund
activities," he said. "It doesn'tgo
to the stadium, it doesn't go-to
the Mott hospital."
Pollack echoed Hanlon, and
said it's important for students
to be aware of how the Univer-
sity spends its money.
"I think all of us in the admin-
istrationreallycareabouthigher
education," she said. "We want
to make sure that (students)
are prepared to make sure that
(their) kids can have the same
kind of education."
CSG President DeAndree
Watson said Hanlon's speech
was informative for CSG mem-
bers.
"I think he clarified why the
tuition has been rising, what
the University has been doing
to increase financial aid for stu-
dents and to mitigate the ris-
ing cost of higher education,"
Watson said. "I think it was
extremely successful."
While the meeting was
intended for members of the
assembly and the University
Council, Watson said he was
disappointed that only the Uni-
versity of Michigan Engineering
Council attended from the Uni-
versity Council.
"I would like to see the Uni-
versity Council be a stronger
body in terms of itsaffiliation
with the legislative branch,"
Watson said. "They really need
this information that was pre-
sented here tonight and I hope
that in the future they will be
more participatory."
Still, Business senior Matt
Eral, the speaker of the assem-
bly, said many members of the
University Council did not
attend because they were only
notified of the meeting on Mon-
day.
Law student Phil Zeeck,
CSG student general counsel,
and Law Student Peter Borock,
theCSG election director, also
addressed CSG members on
the upcoming presidential elec-

tions.
The two discussed changes
that would provide students
with an additional two days to
file their candidacy and respond
to documents returned to them
by CSG. Zeeck said the changes
were implemented due to delays
in obtaining enrollment infor-
mation.
"We had some technical
issues regarding the student
enrollment data that we have
to get from the administration,"
Zeeck said. "The administra-
tion was slow in responding and
once we got them on the ball, we
had a technical glitch that cost
us a day."
The Assembly also passed a
resolution that amends the win-
ter 2012 budget. CSG treasurer
Shreya Singh said the amend-
ment adds about $100,000 to
the CSG budget from funds that
rolled over from the previous
semester.
Singh added that about
$60,000 of the funds come from
those awarded through the
Student Organization Fund-
ing Commission, that were not
spent. She said she expects the
amount of funding that rolls
over from SOFC to decrease
because of organization's new
rolling funding program, where
it awards funding to student
organizations on a weekly basis.
The Assembly also passed a
resolution authored by By Any
Means Necessary - an orga-
nization that supportstthe use
affirmative action - to award
$1,775 to BAMN to fund a bus
shuttle of University students
and faculty to Cincinnati to go to
the 6th U.S. Court of Appeals as
the judiciary hears the appeal in
the case to overturn Proposition
2 - the 2006 ballot initiative
that banned the use of race in
college admissions in Michigan.
BAMN organizer Kate Sten-
vig spoke in support of the reso-
lution and noted that about 47
people will be taking the bus to
Cincinnati. She added that with-
out aid from CSG, BAMN would
have gone into debt funding the
trip.
"It's extremely helpful to not
pay out of pocket," Stenvig said.

A bill for safet
Medical amnesty bill should be signed into law
bill in the state House of Representatives that will exempt
minors from Minor in Possession of Alcohol charges if they're
elping another inebriated person get medical treatment
passed the House yesterday by an overwhelming majority - only
four legislators voted against it. The legislation, House Bill 4393, will
now proceed to the Senate where it will hopefully be passed and then
signed into law. If passed, minors would be able to seek medical atten-
tion due to overconsumption of alcohol for themselves and others
without facing legal repercussions. This medical amnesty legislation
would promote safer behavior around the state, and at the University.
The state Senate and Republican Gov. Rick Snyder should follow the
House's lead and enact the legislation as expediently as possible.

Turning to treatment

W hen a person has a
problem with alcohol
serious enough to land
them in front
of a judge, the
legal system's
first recourse
is to treatment
- rehab, coun-
seling and sup-
port groups.
The reasons for
this approach SETH
are sensible. SODERBORG
Giving alcohol-
ics a second
chance makes it more likely that
they will overcome their addic-
tion and become productive mem-
bers of society. Alcohol abusers are
imprisoned only when their sub-
stance abuse problem has put oth-
ers directly in harm's way. Because
we recognize that alcohol abuse can
afflict spouses and caregivers; we
prefer responses that make it pos-
sible for those family structures to
continue, at least in the long term.
Our approach to alcohol abuse
emphasizes harm reduction. We see
it as a public health problem, and
recognize that some responses cre-
ate as many problems as they solve.
Sometimes, the legal system
treats users of "hard" drugs the
same way. But all too often, our
first recourse in dealing with abuse
of these controlled substances
has been to imprison users. For 30
years, the national anti-drug poli-
cy paradigm has been to imprison
without regard to the broader con-
sequences of that punishment.
This prison-first approach is
tremendously costly and has done
significant harm to entire com-
munities. We need to do better.
And there is good reason to think
that treating drug abuse more like
alcohol abuse will reduce addiction
while minimizing harm.

Medical amnesty would encourage stu-
dents to seek medical attention without the
concern of receiving an MIP. Similar laws
have been enacted in other states, and they've
proven to save lives. Despite increasing
admissions to hospitals for alcohol-related
injuries, there have been no signs of increased
alcohol consumption. The bill will help stu-
dents, and delaying its passage any longer
puts more students at risk.
In January, LSA junior Aditya Sathi, vice

speaker of Central ,Student Government's
Student Assembly, introduced a resolutioh
in support of a medical amnesty policy at the
University. Sathi's work paid off, and CSG
was able to promote the bill in the state Leg-
islature. Students must continue to push for
complete legislation to create a safer com-
munity. Drinking is a part of the University's
culture that isn't going to go away any time
soon. Instead of punishing individuals who
seek help, medical amnesty will protect them.

Scoring schools
College Scorecard can keep universities honest
President Barack Obama's speech at the University in Janu-
ary focused on the main issue pertinent to college students:
the costs and benefits of an education. He proposed the idea
of a comprehensive college scorecard. Applying to colleges, decid-
ing which school to attend and paying for an education is stressful
enough without having to scour websites for accurate information
to compare schools. The introduction of Obama's College-Scorecard
would benefit prospective students and their families, but only if

the information is accurate.
The College Scorecard is supposed to be an
easy and effective way to compare the price,
graduation rates, statistics on student loans,
and the number of students attending in debt.
Some even provide potential earnings statis-
tics. Hours spent flipping through the pages
of the Insider's Guide to Colleges or clicking
through collegeprowler.com could be elimi-
nated with the introduction of this scorecard.
However, the recent influx of stories about
colleges inflating their statistics in the hopes
of raising their national rank makes this
type of continued comparison a cause for
concern. A senior official in the Claremont

University Consortium revealed that he had
been inaccurately reporting SAT scores by
10 points or encouraging students to retake
the SAT after already being admitted. Even
graduate schools such as Cooley Law School
became caught up in the ranking frenzy and
lied about statistics to earn a higher spot.
The College Scorecard needs to contain true
information and not just be another forum
for college advertisement.
With truthful information, the College
Scorecard will help people all over the country
choose an education that is affordable and of
high quality.

MICHAEL SPAETH I
Generation of compromise

Last week, Republican Senator Olympia
Snowe of Maine announced her intentions to
leave the Senate due to her frustration with
the ongoing political gridlock in Washington.
She was a member of a dying breed: a moderate
willingto side with the opposing political party
in order to reach a compromise that would best
serve the interests of the American people.
Ultimately, she was unwilling to tolerate the
lack of compromise any longer.
In an opinion piece in the Washington Post
following her announcement, she wrote, "our
leaders must understand that there is not only
strength in compromise, courage in concili-
ation and honor in consensus-building - but
also a political reward for following these
tenets. That reward will be real only if the peo-
ple demonstrate their desire for politicians to
come together after the planks in their respec-
tive party platforms do not prevail." It's wise
for us to take this message to heart during the
2012 campaign and beyond.
A CBS/New York Times poll conducted in
January found that 85 percent of Americans
wanted to see Democrats and Republicans get
things done, even if that meant compromis-
ing some of their positions. However, Snowe's
parting words are likely to fall on deaf ears in
Washington. Most politicians in Washington
probably aren't going to end the gridlock soon.
But eventually, the current members of Con-
gress will leave, and those vacancies will be
filled by members of our generation.
We must be the generation that embraces
consensus and compromise even if it comes
with personal costs. The real battle for the
soul of American political discourse will not be
fought today, tomorrow or next year. It will be
fought on our terms, and we will win.

How will we win this battle? In his 2010 Yale
Class Day speech, former President Bill Clinton
gave us a hint when he said, "I force myself to
listen to people who disagree with me." This
is not an earth-shattering revelation, but hon-
estly, how often do we actively search for per-
spectives that contradict our own for purposes
other than mocking or denouncing the other
point of view?For most of us, it's not veryoften.
All of us should be able to find at least one
political position that opposes our own and be
able to agree with it. These areas of agreement
can be difficult to pinpoint while we're distract-
ed by the rhetoric of pundits, politicians and
protesters. We won't resolve the fundamental
differences in our political ideologies in the
near future, but in the meantime, if we focus on
finding solutions to the issues on which every-
one can agree, we can make important prog-
ress to improve the lives of many Americans.
Of course, this isn't the only step that must
be taken to end the gridlock in Washington. But
we have to start somewhere, and the best way
to solve an enormous problem is to fix small,
manageable chunks of the problem. Most of us
won't become politicians, but even as private
citizens, we can realize Snowe's vision. Our
generation can clearly demonstrate that we
want politicians to come together if we get in
the habit of finding areas of agreement while
we're still young.
We must have the courage to compro-
mise even at the expense of our own personal
interests, in order to best serve the interests
of everyone. Compromise is manageable, it's
part of our history and it's what the Founding
Fathers intended. So let's get started.

From the
rhetoric of the
Republican
presidential KRISTEN
candidates, one KILEK
might assume
that EPA name-
calling is a prerequisite for the
Republican presidential nomina-
tion.
That idea, however, couldn't be
further from the truth. It was Rich-
ard Nixon - a Republican himself
- who established the EPA in 1970.
The first EPA administrator - Wil-
liam D. Ruckelshaus - formerly
served as a Republican in the Indi-
ana House of Representatives. The-
odore Roosevelt, also a Republican,
is often considered America's first
conservation-minded president due
to his campaigns for federal wild-
life preservation. Conservatives
and conservation have never been
mutually exclusive.
This year, though, every leading
Republican nominee in the presi-
dential race either supports a dras-
tic overhaul of the EPA or a complete
termination of its major functions.
Come November, it seems that the
Republican-Democrat divide on
issues regarding environmental
policy will be gargantuan. Presi-
dential candidates on both sides are
treating the EPA's role as a key vot-
ing issue, with Republicans citing
its over-spending and over-regula-
tion, and Obama looking to expand
its influence.
An October 2011 national survey
conducted by Public Policy Polling
found that 78 percent of Americans
believe that the EPA should hold
corporate polluters accountable for
the pollution they release. Though

bashing the EPA may be what the
Republican party - and its sources
of funding - expects, statistics say
the American public is not eager to
support an anti-EPA GOP candidate.
Even Republican voters are
voicing their discontent over the
extreme anti-EPA stances of their
party's candidates. "Not only are
these positions irresponsible,
they're politically problematic,"
said David Jenkins of Republicans
for Environmental Protection in an
August 2011 The New York Times
article. His organization aims to
restore resource conservation and
environmental protection as key
elements of the Republican Party's
mission.
So which Republican candidates
do Jenkins and the rest of America
have to pick from when it comes to
protecting our environment? Well,
there's Mitt Romney who believes
federal law doesn't give the EPA
authority to regulate carbon emis-
sions. There's Rick Santorum who
has condemned the EPA's limits
on mercury from coal-fired power
plants. Next there is Newt Gin-
grich who believes the ineffective
EPA should be replaced with a new
Environmental Solutions Agency.
Which would, according to his
website, "use incentives and work
cooperatively with local govern-
ment and industry to achieve bet-
ter environmental outcomes." He
maintains that, "contrary to popu-
lar belief, America has more energy
than any nation on earth." Finally,
Ron Paul simply feels that the EPA
is unconstitutional because it con-
flicts with private property rights
and therefore should be eliminat-
ed.
Obama, on the other hand,
emphasizes the importance of
spending federal funds for environ-
mental protection. "We don't have
to choose between dirty air and
dirty water or a growing economy.
We can make sure that we are doing
right by our environment and, in

fact, putting people back to work
all across America," Obama said in
a Jan. 10 speech to EPA employees.
EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson
has replied to Republican attacks
with a similar stance, often refer-
encing EPA job creation and the
lives saved by EPA projects. In a
January speech at the annual Ever-
glades Coalition conference, Jack-
son told the Associated Press that
the Clean Air Act has saved hun-
dreds of thousands of lives and in
the long run, it has saved billions of
U.S. dollars.
Not every
Republicans is
against the EPA.*
Though the Republican presi-
dential candidates present EPA as
a roadblock to business and Ameri-
can jobs, eliminating the organi-
zation is far from a single-handed
solution to the nation's unemploy-
ment problems. It may, however,
halt environmental initiatives
that our government has fought to
improve over the past 40 years.
I don't doubt that the EPA could
run more efficiently. Under the
Bush and Obama administrations,
our national debt has continued to
skyrocket, and it's time to watch
our federal spending and cut cor-
ners where possible.
But eliminating the EPA is most
definitely not possible. Replacing
our financial debt with environmen-
tal exploitation will only bring about
a different kind of debt - one that
future generations will have to pay
for when searching for clean water,
air and land in the years to come.

11M' accomplishes in tourney

The Michigan women's
basketball team defeated
Illinois, 68-53, on Thurs-
day in the first round of the Big
Ten Tournament.
Compared to the seventh-
seeded
Wolverines, MICHAEL
the Fighting LAURILA
Ilini were _
the tenth On Women's
seed and a Basketball
weaker Big
Ten team. In last year's Big Ten
Tournament, Michigan received
a first-round bye and was upset
by bottom-dwelling Illinois in
the second round. The loss was
a fatal blow because it practi-
cally ended any NCAA Tourna-
ment hopes the Wolverines had.
Like last year, Michigan is
currently on the NCAA Tour-
nament bubble, and yet again,
it faced a similar scenario on
Thursday. But the Wolverines
used a stingy defense and an
efficient scoring attack to eas-
ily handle the Fighting Illini on
Thursday.
Though Michigan went on
to lose to No. 16 Ohio State in
the quarterfinals on Friday, the
major work was already done.
What work?
Reaching 20 wins.
Since Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth's arrival in 2007, the
Wolverines have yet to reach 20
wins prior to participating in
the WNIT. Twenty wins doesn't
mean or guarantee anything,
but it's been looming over the
program for a while, specifically
last year when the Wolverines
went 3-3 in the final month of
the season to finish with a 17-13
record.
When Michigan went 9-1 in
the first month this season, 20

wins seemed very reachable.
Even as the season progressed,
the Wolverines won some they
should and lost some they
shouldn't, but the 20-win mark
was always in their sights.
In the final week of the
regular season, Michigan lost
to then-No.22 Purdue in Ann
Arbor and to Iowa on the road.
Winning either of these games
would have given the Wolver-
ines 20 wins on the year, but
they fell just short.
Senior guard Courtney
Boylan has said all season that it
was a goal of the team to reach
20 wins. But the team has also
emphasized focusing on one
game at a time and not looking
too far ahead - specifically,
worrying about numbers such
as 20.
"Oh, (the win against Illinois)
is huge," Boylan said after the
victory.-"Not just win number
20, but win number one in the
Big Ten Tournament. That's
what's most important right
now. That's what we're most
focused on. It's awesome. A
great team win."
Getting to the 20-win mark is
a big step towards earning the
team's first NCAA Tournament
appearance since 2001, and it's
also a big step for the program.
.Between 1999 and 2001 - the
last stretch that Michigan
appeared in the NCAA Tourna-
ment - a 20-win season'was
simply the standard.
For the current elite pro-
grams in the Big Ten - such
as Purdue, Michigan State and
Ohio State - not making the
20-win mark is considered a
poor season. The Wolverines
have finished with winning sea-
sons in all but one of Borseth's

five years, but a winning record
isn't comparable to a 20-win
season.
Though Borseth has been
at the helm for five years, he
was dealt the daunting task of
rebuilding a faltering program
when he took the job. Even after
his team finally reached the
mark they had been striving for,
he only looked at Thursday's
game for what it was - a win.
He also understands that when
it comes to the NCAA Tourna-
ment, there are no certainties.
"(Twenty wins) is something
you always shoot for," Borseth
said. "I don't know that it's the
magic number, it's not, but it's
a good number. Better than 19
and better than 17, which we
had last year. But the first win
in this tournament for us is just
absolutely huge to put us on the
right track and get our confi-
dence back."
Whether Michigan has done
enough to earn its first NCAA
berth in 11 seasons remains to
be seen. But with 17 wins last
year, the Wolverines thought
they might have done enough
for a spot in the field-of-66.
When Selection Sunday came
and went, and Michigan didn't
receive a berth to dance, it went
back to the drawing board to
prepare for the WNIT invita-
tion it received.
NCAA Tournament bid or
not, the 20-win benchmark
is a big step for the women's
program. Borseth was talk-
ing about how the win against
Illinois got Michigan back on
track for the season, but the win
really got the program back on
track - period - and might be
enough for the Wolverines to
dance.

Michigan finishes regular

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
After a grueling regular sea-
son that has spanned more than
five months, an injury on the
Michigan hock-
ey team would NOTEBOOK
be more than
understandable. But even after
weekend series after weekend
series - 36 games in total - the
Wolverines are unscathed.
There have been minor inju-
ries here and there - senior goal-
tender Shawn Hunwick missed a
game in January - but nothing
major, which isn't just remark-
able, but also pretty lucky.
"Right now, we are healthy,
and we are just touching wood
to stay healthy," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson. "There
have been years when we have
had four or five guys out, but
right now, we are good to go."
Last season, Michigan had
to deal with losing now-senior
forward David Wohlberg for the,
playoffs after he injured his col-
larbone in the quarterfinals of
the CCHA Tournament.
Wohlberg's injury was "a
weird hit on the boards," accord-
ing to junior forward A.J. Treais.
There wasn't much of any-
thing Wohlberg could have done
about it - just the luck of the
draw.

Twice the drama in'Awake'

"You're telling me it's how big?"
Addicted e'

Director McQueen
explores the pain of
sex addiction
By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer
Sex addiction. Is there even
such a thing? As minute after
minute of "Shame" passes by
and director
Steve McQueen
("Hunger") fills
in yet another $hae
empty spot
on his canvas At the State
with a somber
depiction of Fox Searchlight
unrestrained
sexual craving, there's no denying
its existence. Make no mistake -
McQueen's finished work is not
an image of hypersexuality, but
of the obsession, guilt and vulner-
ability that accompany any kind
of addiction. And as such, it's an
invaluable work of art.
"Shame" opens with a series
of scenes depicting Brandon's
(Michael Fassbender, "Jane
Eyre") morning routine, wherein
his first task is to see off the new,
strange girl he woke up next to.
Then, Brandon takes the subway
to work. On one particular morn-
ing, he catches the attention of an
attractive woman sitting opposite
him. His brooding, sultry gaze
soon renders her paralyzed; they
.* may be in a subway, but watching

them is like barging in on a pro-
foundly intimate moment. Her
hand, complete with a wedding
ring, shifts uncomfortably across
her thighs as she begins to realize
what's happening. As the subway
door opens, she rushes out with
the shocked revelation that in
those few passionate moments,
she may very well have cheated on
her husband.
That scene may take less than
two minutes to unfold, but it
speaks volumes about the char-
acter. For one, it showcases Fass-
bender's pure and unreserved
reservoir of talent - without a
single word, he manages to dis-
close Brandon's biggest weakness
in a scene that defines the rest of
the movie. But most importantly,
it epitomizes his erratic carnal
cravings that manifest themselves
regardless of time and place.
It's not until Brandon's train
wreck of a sister shows up on his
doorstep that we're able to see
exactly how dysfunctional his
family is. Sissy (Carey Mulligan,
"Drive") is an aspiring singer who
decides to crash at her brother's
house while she finds a stable job.
Stability, however, is not her vir-
tue. Plagued by a history of abu-
sive relationships, Sissy testifies
to everything that's wrong with
Brandon. His lack of support for
Sissy after an undefined family
trauma led her to become sporad-
ic and helpless. Her appearance
revives his guilt, which in turn
fuels his anger, which he then

unleashes on her, making their
relationship a painful, inescap-
able whirlpool.
Sissy's arrival also brings to
the forefront Brandon's frustra-
tion with who he is and what he
is - ashamed. Ashamed of the
way he brought Sissy up, ashamed
of not being able to have an inti-
mate relationship, ashamed of his
vulnerability to addiction and his
inability to pull himself out.
Usually in movies, it's painful
to see the actors walk away with
all the credit. But here, no one can
deny Mulligan and Fassbender
their due acclaim. Their formida-
ble performances allow McQueen
to render everything in the film
less significant than the charac-
ters' raw emotions. Forget Man-
hattan, forget the Boom Boom
Room, forget the subway, the only
faces you'll remember are those of
the lead actors.
But like every other work of
art, this film's beauty is in the
eye of the beholder. Where some
may find themselves annoyed by
the helplessness and incongru-
ity of Brandon and Sissy, others
may come away touched by the
honesty of McQueen's agenda. In
truth, his is an agenda unspoiled
by the Hollywood bug of opti-
mism. "Shame" isn't atale of how
to overcome addiction, it's a tale
of what renders a man so helpless
that he gives up hope of some-
thingbetter. And while imperfect,
it's a moving, masterful cinematic
achievement.

solving separate police cases in
each reality, Britten consciously
tries to decipher which world is
true, but finds eerie, overlapping
details connecting both realms.
Visually, the series is con-
ducted in two shades: Warmer
tones depict the reality in which
Hannah is alive, while cooler
tones depict the world in which
Rex is alive. Michael wears a red
rubber band in his wife's real-
ity and a green one in his son's.
Colors play a large role in helping
Michael - as well as the audi-
ence - keep track of which world
he is immersed in. The shading
scheme is beneficial in separat-
ing the two worlds, allowing the
audience to more easily follow
the complicated environment of
"Awake."
The two realities are remark-
ably different, from the peo-
ple within them to the police
cases Michael undertakes. Yet

Oscar-winning film
examines the pain
of the divorce
By ANDREW MCCLURE
For the Daily
It has almost become an adage
that roughly 50 percent of mar-
riages result in divorce. These
break-ups are
ubiquitous
for a number
of reasons: A Separation
prematurity,
immaturity, At the Michigan
lack of genuine Sony Pictures
compatibility
and just gen-
eral oversight
of the elements that allow mar-
riages to last.
In his fifth film, "A Separa-
tion," Iranian filmmaker Asghar
Farhadi beautifully and compel-
lingly complicates this almost
conventional, gamble-worthy
misfortune. He presents two
coexisting families, each with
their own set of problems,
through the eyes of a not-so-
steady Steadicam - capturing
reality at its most raw.
The opening shot follows
the gaze of a judge in a court-
room as a husband, Nader (Pey-
man Moadi, "About Elly") and
wife, Simin (Leila Hatami, "The
Deserted Station"), ,plead their
divorce cases. The patient camera
remains focused on these two for
several minutes as they bicker,
never revealing the judge's face,
just his voice. Simin wishes to
flee to America and start anew in
the best interest of their studious
daughter. Nader refuses to leave
his Alzheimer's-stricken father,
who is in a vegetative state and
needs care. A brilliant title slide
arrives onscreen once the pair
diverges in opposite directions
from the courtroom. Off to agood
start.

SONY PICTURES CLASSICS

"Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!"

The second half of the story
introduces itself in the form of
the soon-to-be-divorced couple's
lower-caste, pregnant house sit-
ter, Razieh (newcomer Sareh
Bayat), and her adorable young
daughter. She cleans, sweeps,
takes out the garbage and takes
care of Nader's ill father, who sits
motionlessly and speechlessly in
his bed all day.
The fun and games halt one
day when Nader returns home to
find his near-dead father lying on
the ground beside the bed with
his hands tied to a panel. Livid, he
confronts Razieh the following
day, accusing her of trying to kill
his father and for stealing a week's
pay from his bedroom. Shit hits
the fan when Nader shoves her
out of his apartment, causing her
to fall. Subsequently, she accuses
him of killing her unborn baby, a
murder charge.
Very quickly, this film heads
toward a visceral treatment of

family, religion and the big, fat lie.
Farhadi smoothly shifts from the
disintegrating marriage of Nader
and Simin, while their innocent
and rational daughter suffers
from it all, and the couple who
miscarried trying to stay afloat
financially. As events unfold into
a whirlpool of high-flying emo-
tion and clenched fists, Farhadi
keeps local his most levelheaded
characters: the daughters, one
from each family. They serve as
voices of moral reason, something
that, apparently, grown adults
have trouble seeing through the
fogs of ego and self-interest. The
youngest figures have the hefti-
est wisdom and poise, while the
adults engage in "he said, she
said" child's play.
All these negative events may
make one think Farhadi is a pessi-
mistic filmmaker; rather, he expli-
cates his message through honest,
gritty and spellbinding perfor-
mances from all his actors. Much

doubt resides within the char-
acters themselves, but audience
members shouldn't doubt relating
to these characters because of the
cultural gap between America
and Iran, because these are real
families with real issues; Iran is
merely a backdrop.
It's evident that Farhadi fan-
cies and immerses himself
within the concept of fam-
ily, something so indefinable,
so multifaceted. Sticking with
his verisimilitude approach, he
ensures that each character is
equally imperfect, which makes
"rooting" for one side over the
other quite onerous.
Leaving the theater, one feels
that Farhadi had a supernatural
grip on his treatment of the woes
in family life. A tight, no-frills
script allows the cast to shine
throughout. Unless subtitle read-
ing makes you purple in the face,
sprint to the box office for this
Iranian goodness.

The Academy Awards are long

and decision-making process
not only keeps the top echelon

actors' lives. Winning an Oscar
is the pinnacle of an actor's
career, but where does this long
and winding road begin?
The newly developed compa-
ny StarCast is an online service
which hopes to benefit actors
and Hollywood professionals.
The casting directors assess
the actor's performances that
are submitted, and then give
the actors specific feedback and
notes. They then choose the

that being represented by an agen-
cy is more essential than a minor
role on television or film. How-
ever, there have been no actors
signed by agencies thus far.
Nevertheless, Beer declared
that StarCast is an up-and-com-
ing company that is different
from other services available.
"We are the only service that
guarantees that an actor will be
seen, viewed and evaluated by
castingdirectors," Beer said. "All
the others, to my knowledge, are
basically listing services where
an aspiring actor can establish
an account of their headshot,
reel and their resume, and in
many cases, they get access to
general information about audi-
tions. Those are the basic ser-
vices."
Hollywood is one of the hard-
est fields to carve a place for
yourself, but with the help of
StarCast, that could possibly
change for Maxwell and other
aspiring actors.

SB Wednesday, March 7, 2012 The Statement

Serious animal love
I love animals, and calling me animal-obsessed is probably putting it mildly. But it's comfort-
ing to know that I'm not alone. When a walk down South Main Street led me to Peaceable King-
dom, and its shop dog Jane Russell, I was thrilled. And then, curious: How many other animals
lived in stores in Ann Arbor, and how could I meet them all? Soon, I discovered Lewis the cat from
Downtown Home and Garden, Nathaniel the rabbit from Lexi's Toy Box and Tank the Chihuahua
from Red Shoes. All of these shop animals have two things in common: Owners who want to
make every day bring-your-pet-to-work day and customers who adore them - Lewis even has an
address for his fan mail! So the next time you're walking by one of these stores, don't hesitate to
pop in - as long as you remember that the most priceless "items" are not for sale.

Here's a crazy idea ... don't overdraft your account. As for the $2.95
checking account, the bank is taking a loss on this account below X number
of monthly transactions. They are providing you a service, not charity. Why
is it so absurd to be asked to pay $3 a month to maintain the security and

do you think about tuition at
Michigan?
For an institute that provides such
higher education I think it's appro-
priate. Part of the appeal of com-
ing here is the professors and the
facilities, and that comes from the
money we pay. We put into it what
we want to get out. But I don't
think it's fair that in-state kids pay
significantly less than we do.
So do you think that out-of-state
should be charged less or in-
state charged more?
In-state Out of state
It should be equal. It's not like the
kids out-of-state are getting more
or the kids in-state are getting less.
We're exposed to the same materi-
als, the same resources - it should
be across the board. I think it's not
fair.
What do you think about how
tuition increases after a certain
number of credits?
I don't think it should be a scaled
thing. It's just an excuse to charge
us more. You need an expected
amount of credits to graduate, so
you can't avoid paying more. And,
if you came in from high school
with credits then you have to pay
more earlier on. It's a flawed sys-
tem.

I-.t mented students cannot afford
I yL( the University's steep out-of-state
tuition, there are people in the Uni-
versity who are advocating for them.
The Coalition for Tuition Equality, a
student group comprising numerous
organizations on campus in support
of the rights of undocumented resi-
dents, was founded by Public Policy
junior Kevin Mersol-Barg last year.
According to Mersol-Barg, many
undocumented students "came here
as children and grew up in Michigan
communities here and graduated
from Michigan high schools. (They)
did not choose to come here."
Mersol-Barg, who is also a Central
Student Government assembly rep-
resentative and is running for CSG
president on the OurMichigan party
ticket, said CTE originated from his
campaign for LSA assembly represen-
tative lastyear.
"I was looking for a way to help
minority students on campus and I think one particularly disad-
vantaged group areundocumented students," Mersol-Barg said.
He added that in order to maintain its standing as the "lead-
ers and best" on social issues, the University needs to make its
education available to students who deserve it.
"(The University should) make sure that higher education
is accessible to all groups, not just the individuals that can
pay, but the individuals that need it most," Mersol-Barg said.
"(Those) that clearly are academically qualified, but financial
barriers prevent them from coming to the University."
University spokeswoman Kelly Cunningham wrote in an
e-mail that the University remains neutral on the issue.
"The University has not taken a position on that topic," she
wrote. "...Citizenship is not considered during the admissions
process, and it is not a factor in the admissions decision."

Maria Ibarra may not be very different from you. She grew
up in Michigan, graduated from Fordson High School in Dear-
born and is now a senior at the University of Detroit-Mercy. Her
mother is a nurse, her father works in construction and her family
pays taxes.
Like you, Ibarra believes she is an American. But unlike you,
the U.S. government disagrees with her. Instead, the govern-
ment identifies Ibarra as an undocumented resident. She can-
not obtain a driver's license. She cannot check out books from a
public library. Many University students decrylhigh tuition, but
her status as an undocumented resident actually prevented her
from attending the University of Michigan due to tuition costs.
Ibarra had her "heart set" on attending the University, but
undocumented residents - no matter how long they have lived
in the state - must pay out-of-state tuition at the University of
Michigan.

The debate was almost turned on its head two years ago
when the DREAM Act garnered 52 votes in the Senate - eight
short of passage. If passed, the DREAM ACT would have
granted permanent residence to some undocumented resi-
dents who had come toAmerica as minors.
It was around this time that Ibarra came out as an undocu-
mented resident.
"Growing up, it was always a secret," she said. "My parents
actually used to tell me, 'If anybody ever asks you, you were
born here; you (are) a U.S. citizen.'"
After meeting with One Michigan, an immigrant rights
group for young people, she decided it was time to announce '
her residency status.
Ibarra said members of One Michigan told her that she had to
tell her story because someone else would have told it incorrectly.
Mersol-Barg said the problems faced by undocumented stu-
dents are not simply anecdotal. They affect a large segment of
students.
According to a 2007 report from the UCLA Center for
Labor Research and Education, 65,000 undocumented stu-
dents graduate from U.S. high schools annually.
Several campus groups are working with CTE to advocate
for tuition equality. CSG passed a resolution authored by Mer-
sol-Barg in support of tuition equality at the University.
On Feb. 16, CTE and supporters attended the Regents
meeting, where LSA freshman Daniel Morales spoke about
waiting a year after high school before attending the Uni-
versity because he was undocumented. He enrolled at the
University after his father petitioned the government on
his behalf and he was granted full citizenship - just as his
father received amnesty under the Immigration Control and
Reform Act of 1986, signed into effect by President Ronald
Reagan.
On Feb. 22, journalist Jose Antonio Vargas spoke on campus
to a packed audience at Rackham Amphitheater through a CTE-
sponsored event that promoted an open dialogue about immi-
gration to the United States. Vargas, a Pulitzer Prize winner, is
well-known for a New York Times Magazine essay he wrote last
year in which he publicly identified himself as undocumented.
Ibarra said being American shouldn't be solely based on
whether you're born in the country.
"You should earn the right to be called an American 'cause
it's not just something you're born with," Ibarra said. "I wish
there was a wayto earn the term 'American.'"

Ibarra moved to Michigan from
Mexico when she was 9 years old
on a now-expired tourist visa with
ier mother and her brother. Her
father had alreadybeen in the Unit-
ed States after crossing the border
illegally. Since then, Ibarra said
she has lived a life different from
what most people perceive the life
ofan undocumented resident to be.
"I always tell people, 'I don't
think I've led the life of an undoc-
umented student,' "she said.
For instance, her family pays
taxes with a Taxpayer Identifi-
cation Number. She lives in the
suburbs and her parents are able
to support the family financially.
However, when it came time to
apply to college, Ibarra said she did
noteven bother to apply to the Uni-
versity The undergraduate appli-
cation for the University asks for
citizenship and requires those who
identify as U.S. citizens to supply
their social securitynumbers.
Ibarra doesn't have a social
security number. So while her

is for Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and
state legislators to invest more resources
in higher education, according to Pol-
lack. And in a state with limited financial
resources, it is difficult to convince Lan-
sing to invest in higher education above
other fields.
"We need citizens, business people,"
Pollack said. "Everyone has to buy into
the value of higher education and explain
why it's so important. It's going to take
some political will and it's going to take
some recognition of the value of higher
education by the legislators."
On Feb. 15, representatives of Business
Leaders for Michigan went before the
Michigan Senate Appropriations Sub-
committee for Higher Education to argue
that the trend of divesting in higher edu-
cation was a huge mistake.
A main point of the testimony was that
this year the state will spend 76 percent
more of its general fund on prisons than
on higher education. The group said it
couldn't understand whythe state spends
more money on prisons than public uni-

Obama cited the University as an example of how this
plan can be successful.
"Here at Michigan, you've done a lot to find savings in
your budget," he said. "We know this is possible."
The University has worked to cut down its general fund
budget. Since 2003, the University has slashed $235 million
and has saved almost $400 million through cost sharing
and other changes.
The University has cut down its expenditures by cre-
ating energy-saving programs. It also recently imple-
mented a policy that requires departments to schedule
more Friday and early morning classes to better utilize
classrooms. And the University is "actively pursuing
e-books," according to Pollack, in order to cut down text-
book expenses.
But there are morethings the University can do, accord-
ing to Watson.

What do you say to students worried about their
futures?
Take some time off. I say that because, forcing the issue,
I don't think necessarily ever really works. Sometimes you
need to allow for the happy accident to occur
Is there a certain event or work of art that moved you
to study American Culture?
I think the whole period of the early 7960s. 1 don't think
that 1 could point to a specific album. But it was the
context of the folk music revival. The whole vibrancy of
America rediscovering its musical roots.
If you had any superpower, what would it be?
I hate traveling. I hate the time it takes to travel. So I'd
like to be like either The Flash or Superman.
