MINNEAPOLIS - Just six
minutes into the first half, Min-
nesota's primary ball handler,
Andre Hollins, picked up his sec-
ond foul and headed to the bench.

Almost immediately, the Golden
Gophers began to cough up the
ball.
Michigan took those freebies
and had no issue pushing the ball
up the court to finish its posses-
sions in an emphatic dunk or a
Tim Hardaway Jr. 3-pointer.
Ten first-half turnovers for
No. 9 Minnesota (3-2 Big Ten,
15-3 overall) led to 22 fast-break
points for the Wolverines in their
83-75 victory over the Golden
Gophers, a facet of their game
that was almost absent in Sun-
day's road loss to Ohio State.

"I think it was important for
us to get out in transition," said
sophomore guard Trey Burke.
"We knew in the first half against
Ohio State, we were kind of too
stagnant, we played too much
half-court offense. When we
get out in

important forus to do that."
But Michigan's transition

game tapered off in the second
half and the Golden Gophers
crept back in the game. Despite
good shooting and scoring 24
points off turnovers, the Wolver-
ines - who led by as many as 19
inthe secondhalf- slowed down
its offense and let Minnesota
execute its defense and rebound
effectively to make Thursday's
top-ten showdown a close game

Stallman chides
Apple, Google for
privacy policies
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily News Editor
Richard Stallman doesn't
have a cell phone.
He doesn't', buy DVDs,
doesn't use Windows or Mac
OS laptops and doesn't use
closed-source commercial soft-
ware. He is not on Facebook
and has never owned a car.
But he isn't a Luddite or
computer illiterate. In fact, he
loves technology and the Inter-
net. At one point, he hoped the
Internet would stop censorship
around the world.
Stallman is the founder and
presidentofthe advocacygroup
Free Software Foundation and
was one of the main creators of
the open-source GNU/Linux
operating system. Speaking for
two hours at a packed Stamps
Auditorium, Stallman lament-
ed the prevalence of online
tracking and the rise of closed-
source programs.
"Digital technology allows
surveillance that Stalin can
only dream of," Stallman said.

Stallman advocates for open-
source software where users
are given access and encour-
aged to modify the source code
of programs they use. He dis-
tinguished between "free as in
freedom" software and zero-
cost software, saying that they
do not necessarily go hand-
in-hand. He told the audience
that closed-source programs
- programs that don't allow
this access - could harbor mal-
ware and "backdoor" exploits
because users can't review it's
code.
Wearing a red polo, brown
pants and no shoes, he attacked
companies including Apple,
Google, Microsoft, Adobe,
Amazon and Rovio, the cre-
ators of Angry Birds. Stallman
claimed these companies col-
lected copious amounts of data,
and some of their software
allowed malicious programs to
be installed.
"You should never use the
Amazon swindle," Stallman
said to laughs. "The official
naise of that product isthe Kin-
dle. Kindle means to start a fire
which I think is meant to sug-
gest that its purpose is virtual
book burning."

13B&FUniversity researchers look "
at pollutants in Great Lakes

Collaborative
initiative maps
ecosystem stresses
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily NewsaReporter
Over Winter Break, Univer-
sity researchers have teamed up
with international colleagues"
in a recently released study to
analyze the most pressingissues
that endanger the Great Lakes.
The University-centered
Great Lakes Environmental
Assessment and Mapping proj-
ect identified mercury contami-
nation, changing water levels,
four invasive species -and 28
other environmental stressors
disruptive to the Great Lakes.
GLEAM presented these
findings on a website launched
in December that features
interactive maps of the Great
Lakes. The findings are also
published in the Jan. 2 Proceed-
ings of the National Academy of
Sciences journal.
The maps exhibit how each
individual stressor affects an
area in the Great Lakes, and a
general map shows the total
impact of the stressors. The
stress index of the latter map
indicates that Lake Ontario is
the most affected, followed by
Lakes Erie, Michigan, Huron
and Superior. Other maps illus-
trate the benefits that the lakes
provide humans, such as beach-
es and commercial fishing.
J. David Allan, a professor in
the School of Natural Resources
and Environment and one of
four leaders of GLEAM, said the
ongoing project is intended to

"develop the right kinds of infor-
mationto assist restoration."
The project - now tied to the
three-month-old University of
Michigan Water Center - was
funded by the Fred A. and Barbara
M. ErbFamilyFoundation, agroup
that supports initiatives to better
the Great Lakes community.
Adrienne Marino, a research
specialist at the Water Center,
- said she assisted in the collection
of data provided by researchers
and resource management agen-
cies hailing from the Great Lakes
region. The team compiled data
by analyzing, processing and
mapping published research and
weighing the importance of each
stressor.
"Applying stressor weightings
and completing other transforma-
tions and calculations were neces-
sary to put the individual maps on
a consistent scale and to develop
the cumulative map," Marino said.
Gregory Boyer, chair of chemis-
try at the State University of New
York's College of Environmental
Science and Forestry, was one of
the 15 working group members. .
Boyer noted that the most
destruction has occurred in shal-
low waters. In deeper offshore
waters, Boyer said, water sepa-
rates into warmer top waters and
cooler deep waters. Between these
two layers is a thermocline, an
area where dramatic temperature
change occurs.
Boyer said this stratification is
necessary to prevent pollutants
from affecting humans and to
ensure that harmful algal blooms
cannot reach sunlight that would
support its growth, a process that
would lead to other environmen-
tal complications.
"When you're talking about a

chemical pollutant ... offshore, it
absorbs through a particle, goes
through the thermocline and is
effectively removed from human
contact," Boyersaid.
Boyer said he worries that shal-
lowwaterswere most affected.
"This is especially troublesome
because these are the waters that
humans use more, like in beach-
es," Boyer said. "Nearshore often
sees more stress than the off-
shore waters."
Allan said the GLEAM project
has already provided data to the
Nature Conservancy, the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service and other
environmental groups. But, he
said, additional work is still nec-
essary. For example, the cumula-
tive stress index used by the maps,
which totals up each stressor and
its weighted importance, doesn't
fully convey environmental prob-
lems.
"Increasingly in the field of
understanding environmental
stressors affecting ecosystems, we
realized that stressors are interac-
tive," Allan said. "Invasive species
one and invasive species two might
be a double whammy that's bigger
than their sum."
In the meantime, Sigrid Smith,
a research associate of the School
of Natural Resources and; Envi-
ronment who also led GLEAM,
said the Great Lakes might never
reach hypothetical . "normal"
environmental conditions. For
that reason, targeted goals may
need rethinking.
"I think of the target of resto-
ration as promoting ecosystem
health, so that the native popula-
tions of plants, animals and other
organisms are as healthy as pos-
sible and produce as much human
benefit as possible."

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Gov. Snyder to
discuss light rail
transit funding
Gov. Rick Snyder says he'll join
U.S. Transportation Secretary
Ray LaHood and other officials
in Detroit on Friday for "a major
funding announcement" that
is expected to involve plans for
a light rail system between the
city's downtown and the cultural,
medical and educational center a
few miles north.
LaHood's office said in a state-
ment Wednesday that Mayor
Dave Bing, U.S. Sens. Carl Levin
and Debbie Stabenow and others
will be at Wayne State University
to reveal details of a plan "that
will significantly expand transit
options in downtown Detroit."
Snyder announced his partici-
pation Thursday.
LaHood has been in talks for
months with city, regional and
state officials on their part of a
deal to create a 3.3-mile light rail
line that's expected to cost $137
million.
CHICAGO
Man who aided
terrorist groups
sentenced
A Chicago businessman was
sentenced to 14 years in prison
Thursday for providing mate-
rial support to overseas terrorism,
includingaPakistanigroupwhose
2008 attacks in Mumbai, India,
left more than 160 people dead.
Tahawwur Rana did not
address the court before U.S. Dis-
trict Judge Harry Leinenweber
imposed the sentence and did not
react afterward. But his defense
attorneys said the judge was right
to reject prosecutors' arguments
that Rana deserved a stiffer sen-
tence because the charges were
related to terrorism.
Jurors in 2011 convicted Rana
of providing support for the Paki-
stani group, Lashkar-e-Taiba,
and for supporting a never-car-
ried-out plot to attack a Danish
newspaper that printed cartoons
of the Prophet Muhammad in
2005. The cartoons angered
many Muslims because pictures
of the prophet are prohibited in
Islam.
LONDON
UK police to
investigate an 80s
pedophile gang
British police have launched
an official probe into claims
that senior politicians had links
to a pedophile gang during the
1980s.
Scotland Yard says the inves-
tigation is looking into historic
child ahuse allegations at a Lon-
don guest house.
Thursday's announcement

came after opposition Lahour
Party lawmaker Tom Watson
claimed last year that there
was evidence that a member of
a pedophile ring boasted about
his connections with a "senior
aide to a former prime minis-
ter."
CAIRO
Death toll rises
to 26 in Egypt
building collapse
Egyptian health officials say
the death toll in the collapse of
an eight-story apartment build-
ing in the coastal city of Alexan-
dria has risen to 26.
They say the death toll rose
when one of the 12 people injured
in the accident succumbed to her
injures on Thursday in hospital.
The building in a poor Alex-
andria district collapsed on
Wednesday, a day after 19 police
conscripts were killed when the
last car of the train they were
riding in jumped the tracks and
smashed into another train near
Cairo.
The officials spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity because they
were not authorized to speak to
the media.

dent fiscal policy, which has led
to many coordination problems
across the continent, according
to Adams.
"Some people argue that the
reason why there was a bal-
ance of payments problem was
because there was a regulation
problem," Adams said. "And
the labor market regulation
problem caused the balance
of payments problem, which
caused the bank problem,
which caused the sovereign
debt problem."
Because of the variety of dif-
ferent diagnoses for Europe's
central economic problems,
determining appropriate pre-
scriptions for the financial
epidemic becomes more com-
plicated.
It's yet to be determined
whether Europe needs
increased government expen-
diture more liquidity, less
liquidity or a change in regula-
tory policy, Adams said.
He added that because of
Europe's de facto "reverse Fed-
eralist" system, it's sometimes
difficult for Americans to under-
stand that solutions to the eco-
nomic issues may not be solved
unless there is a direct change to

EU policy. Since no fiscal union
or constraints currently exist,
the EU and European Central
Bank are powerless to control
the spending and debt ratios of
member nations - a chief cause
of the crisis.
Rackham student Caitie
Goddard said she was glad for
the opportunity to learn about
international economics. She
added that she believed Adams
approached the issue in a way
that would help American stu-
dents understand a foreign
problem.
"I think today was about an
international perspective on
economic issues in the Europe-
an Union, but hearing a Michi-
gan professor discuss various
solutions as well as the history
was beneficial," Goddard said.
After Adams' lecture, LSA
senior Joe Centlivre, Alpha
Kappa Psi Fraternity president,
said-he hopes the lecture gave
the average student a better
understanding of the complex
issue.
"You hear (in) the news
all the time that 'Greece has
another bailout' or 'The EU has
a crisis,"' Centlivre said. "But
to the extent that we under-
stand the problems or the pos-
sible solutions, I don't think
there's that great of an under-
standing."

WIN
From Page 1
ence opponent - confident and
poised - was a complete turn-
around to how it fared against
the Buckeyes, and was exactly
what Michigan coach John
Beilein wanted to see from his
team in yet another hostile envi-
ronment.
"Winning road games in this
league (is important)," Beilein
said. "In the past, there were
maybe three ranked teams, maybe
four. With Wisconsin's win (over
Indiana on Tuesday), you're going
to have seven ranked teams very
soon."
"There's seven games you have
to win against ranked teams on
the road. That doesn't happen
very often. So as a result, when
you get them, they're really
important (to win) if you're going
to stay on the top of the (Big Ten)
standings."
But at the beginning of the
game, the Wolverines didn't look
like they were playing to earn a
statement conference win on the
road. Minnesota forward Trevor
Mbakwe fired up the crowd early
with two consecutive blocks on

redshirt junior forward Jordan
Morgan. In response, Hardaway
Jr. and Burke sparked the perim-
eter offense for.Michigan.
Hardaway, who had a similar
performance his freshman year
in Minnesota, tallied 17 first-half
points, 12 of which came from
beyond the are, on 6-of-7 shoot-
ing. He was often found open on
the wing, and the extra passes
by Burke or freshman guard Nik
Stauskas found Hardaway open
for the bucket. Hardaway cooled
off in the second half, finishing
with 21 points on 7-of-8 shooting.
Burke also took control of the
game early, shedding his defender
to be able to. penetrate and kick
out, something he wasn't able
to do against Aaron Craft and
Ohio State. The sophomore point
guard - wearing No. 12 after
his usual No. 3 was ripped early
in the game - dished out nine
assists and added 18 points while
playing basically an error-free
game against a tough Minnesota
defense.
And though Hardaway,
Burke and the rest of the guards
accounted for 57 points, Mbakwe
wasn't able to silence Morgan and
the forwards for the entire game.
After Morgan was stuffed in the

paint early, freshman forward
Mitch McGary entered the game
and let his presence be felt.
The 6-foot-10 big man was able
to keep pace with Mbakwe, tal-
lying eight points and. even had
three steals. Morgan reestab-
lished himself in the second half
and finished with nine points,
four rebounds and a ripped jer-
sey, and both big men were able
to overcome the physicality of the
post to help out in the win.
"Guys were out there, we were
out there in the war, we had to
stick it out in the second half,"
Burke said.
Added Hardaway: "It's Big Ten
season, everybody's going to be
physical, everybody's trying to
win."
Thursday's win was Michi-
gan's first win against a top-10
team on the road since 1996, but
Beilein doesn't think getting any
more road wins will be easier,
especially with the conpetitive-
ness of the conference.
"If you look at this season, right
now, we're going to have to do

nary - to be in the Big Ten hunt.

a more diverse offering, the
focus shifted to making the
University more attractive to
recruiters from companies
of all sizes and to show them
the broad range of talent at
Michigan.
The organizers reached out
to high-profile and innova-
tive information-technology
companies such as Square,
a developer of card-reading
solutions for mobile devices
started by a founder of Twit-
ter, and Venmo, a start-up
that has created a method
for simple electronic money
transactions.
"We really wanted to get
ourselves out there," Eagle
said. "Not a lot of people know
that Michigan is such a hub
for engineering talent and tal-
ent all around."
Generally, the companies
in attendance were engineer-
ing-focused and technology-
based. However, Eagle noted
that high demand among
start-ups for fresh talent
across all disciplines meant
that start-ups would be recep-
tive to hiring"anyone they get
along with and anyone they
can work well with."
"The thing with start-ups is
that they really will take any
major because there isn't any
quota to fill," Eagle said. "They
don't really look for specific
jobs as long as your skillset fits
in with what they are looking

for."
Speaking from, personal
experience, Eagle acknowl-
edged that larger, established
corporations are usually con-
sidered to be a safe bet for
students - offering entic-
ing salaries and relative job
security. However, he said
the "cool atmosphere and fun
culture" of start-ups would be
more attractive to many recent
graduates and seniors.
"For any student that is
looking for a team-building
environment, start-ups are
definitely the way to go," Eagle
said.
Business junior Christian
Weiss pointed out that start-
ups had a lot of potential
for innovative students who
didn't see themselves as fitting
the traditional job mold.
"I think (start-ups) offer
a lot of potential for people
who don't want to be a cog in
the machine of a big company
and want to play an active role
in their company's future,"
Weiss said.
Unlike most career fairs,
formal attire was neither nec-
essary nor expected by the
start-up companies. Though
many students chose to adhere
to business-casual attire,
Weiss noted that the lack of a
dress code was favorable for
Michigan students.
"Students love not havingto
get a full suit on," Weiss said.
"But some companies like the
professionalism and some
companies don't, so you have
to find abalance.

ence he doesn't own a cell phone
because of privacy concerns and
told the audience they should
think twice about the information
they provide to companies.
"I don't use the things that
don't respect our freedom," Stall-
man said in an interview follow-
ing the speech. "I choose to use
technology if I think it's good,
and if I think it's bad I say 'no' to
it."
His presentation had some

quirks - he ran offstage to go to
the bathroom and interrupted his
introducer.
He repeated throughout the
presentation how important it
was for people to use "free" soft-
ware because it promoted their
own freedoms.
At the end of his speech,
Stallman auctioned off a signed
stuffed animal gnu - a type of
wildebeest whose name was
appropriated by Stallman for an
operating :system he helped to
develop - to raise money for the
Free Software Foundation.
"We hope that people will

organize to resist these abuses
because they are not inherent,"
Stallman said after the talk. "If we
allow the government and com-
panies to decide what our digital
technology does they will lead it
in a bad direction."
After a heated auction, Rack-
ham student Adam Pierc paid
$150 for the stuffed animal.
"I think he's a really influen-
tial and important figure and,
secondly, I think it's a good
cause," Pierc said. "Free soft-
ware is extremely important and
will only become more impor-
tant as time goes on."

over the city's finances.
State Representative Thomas
Stallworth III (D-Detroit) said
the idea of an emergency manager
in Detroit is feasible, but remains
unconvinced such an appointee
would make a difference.
"I'm not sure if the financial
managers can do anything bet-
ter than cut services, which only
continues the decline of the city,"
Stallworth said. "What we need is
an environment that allows us to
stabilize and grow."
Stallworth said that real, coher-
ent support from the state legisla-
ture seems to be absent. The city
needs to fix legacy problems and
augment core services that attract
people to live there. He added that
the city needs an inclusive discus-
sion that effectively engages the
local Detroit's residents.
Snyder's spokesman, Caleb
Buhs, said the review team is
looking into appointing an emer-
gency financial manager, as well

as a few other options.
"There's no determination
that's been made that an emer-
gency financial manager will be
going into Detroit," Buhs said.
"That is what the review team's
currently looking into."
Buhs said a financial manager
would have powers including
in the ability to take immediate
actions, modify contracts and
negotiate with stakeholders to
receive concessions that elected
officials may be unwilling or
unable to leverage.
"Part of the concern in Detroit
currently is that the mayor and
the city council had some trouble
working together to get things
done, essentially," Buhs said.
"And if a manager were in place,
it would be one person leading
the charge, so maybe they can
take action quicker."
The likely alternative to a
financial manager would be
a consent agreement. If that's
the case, Buh said the review
team would negotiate a consent
agreement with the city and
lay out a plan relieve financial

troubles.
"They're currently work-
ing under a consent agreement
(between the state and Detroit)
from a previous review team
... that was under Public Act 4,
which went away with the vote
in November," Buhs said.
State Representative Jeff
Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) argued
that emergency managers have
not been successful in turning
around the city's financial stand-
ing. He cited Robert Bobb, an
emergency financial manager for
Detroit Public Schools, who was
appointed with a $300-million
annual deficit and left office with
an even larger deficit two years
later.
Irwin said he doubts the state
will appoint an emergency man-
ager because their abilities are
limited to layoffs and reducing
workers' wages.
"It is odd to believe that a city
struggling with serious financial
problems can be fixed by bring-
ing in some individual from the
outside with a magic wand,"
Irwin said.

Syrian pro-regime gunmen
kill more than 100 people

Amateur video
shows militia
killing families,
burning bodies
BEIRUT (AP) - Gunmen loyal
to President Bashar Assad swept
through a mainly Sunni farm-
ing village in central Syria this
week, torchinghouses and killing
more than 100 people, including
women and children, opposition
activists said Thursday.
The reported slayings fueled
accusations that pro-government
militiamen are trying to drive
majority Sunnis out of areas near
main routes to the coast to ensure
control of an Alawite enclave as
the country's civil war increasing-
ly takes on sectarian overtones.
Activists said the attackers
were from nearby areas dominat-
ed by Shiite Muslims and allied
Alawites. Assad and most of the
top officials in his regime belong
to the minority Alawite sect, a
Shiite offshoot.
The events in Haswiyeh, an
impoverished farming area on
the edge of Homs, unfolded on
Tuesday and Wednesday, but
only came to light Thursday as
the reported scale of the killings

became apparent.
An amateur video posted
online showed veiled women
sitting on.the floor surrounded
by children as they described a
horrific scene of gunmen killing
people and burningbodies.
"They slaughtered members
of the same families then turned
the diesel heaters on them," one
of the women said, adding that
some homes were robbed of
money and jewelry as well. "We
did not fight and we had no gun-
men. We are all workers trying to
make a living."
Another video showed
a charred room with what
appeared to be two blackened
bodies on the floor. A man could
be heard weeping in the back-
ground. The caption said the
video is from Haswiyeh.
The videos appeared genu-
ine and corresponded to other
Associated Press reporting on
the events depicted, although
exact details of what happened
were unclear and could not be
independently verified because
of restrictions on independent
media.
A government official in
Damascus denied the reports,
saying no such killings took place
in the area and accusing reb-
els of using civilians as "human

shields." He spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity because he
was not authorized to brief the
media.
However, the pro-govern-
ment daily newspaper Al-
Watan reported Thursday that
Syrian troops advanced in the
countryside of Homs "cleans-
ing the villages of Haswiyeh
and Dweir as well as their
fields" fromgunmen. It did not
elaborate.
The attacks come- amid a
spike in violence in Syria and a
particularlybloody week.
Activists on Thursday night
said a foreign journalist died
whilecoveringclashesbetween
rebels and regime forces in the
northern city of Aleppo. The
Aleppo Media Center, a net-
work of anti-regime activists
in the city, said the journalist
was shot by a regime sniper
positioned on the roof of the
Aleppo central prison near the
Museilmeh district.
The claim could not be inde-
pendently verified.
Twenty-eight journalists
were killed in Syria in 2012,
prompting the Committee to
Protect Journalists to name
Syria the most dangerous
country in the world to work
in last year.

To realize that I was the victim of what was

reported his supposedly deceased girlfriend never existed.

Too much fun in the sun?
Regents' California meeting prevents public input
n Thursday and Friday, seven members of the University's
Board of Regents joined with University President Mary Sue
Coleman and other University officials in Los Angeles for a
series of meetings. These meetings, which were private, took place in
lieu of their scheduled public monthly meeting inAnn Arbor. During the
trip, they were scheduled to discuss strategies for public funding and the
prospects of massive online open courses, or MOOCs, as well as recon-
nect with California's alumni network by hosting fundraising events.
Despite the possible benefits resulting from the trip, it was unnecessary
at this time and further distanced the public from the regents.

University regents traveled to California
and met with Robert Birgeneau, recently
retired chancellor of the University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley; Stanford University President
John Hennessy; and Robert Berdahl, former
president of the Association of American Uni-
versities. They discussed the future of aca-
demia, especiallythe lack of state funding. Like
public universities in Michigan, universities
in California have suffered from a crippling
drop in state funding, with the state backing
only 37 percent of the UC system in 2012. This
meeting gives the University the opportunity
to learn how to run a premier public institu-
tion with significantly reduced public funding.
The regents also met with Dan Russell, one
of Google's top research scientists, who pro-
posed that the University invest in Google's
MOOCs. According to Russell, MOOCs have
the potential to create a competitive market
for teaching, giving the University an edge in
innovative education.
Regardless of whether regents'meetings are
held in Michigan or California, they shouldn't
be closed to the public. The regents are pub-
licly elected, and the public should have the
opportunity to voice their concerns. In a given
year, the regents hold 11 meetings, but as a
result of this meeting, there will only be 10
in 2013. Rick Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the
University, said that the switch from a public
meetingto a private session is due to "schedul-
ing issues." More of an effort should have been

made on the regents' and University's part to
make this meeting available to everyone. The
University has a responsibility to keep their
students involved and well-informed, and
moving one of the monthly meetings across
the country creates a disconnect between the
regents and the public they serve.'
While in California, the regents will attend
two alumni events as honored guests. While
the events aren't technically fundraisers,
the regents plan on engaging with alumni in
the Golden State in order to encourage giv-
ing back to the University. In an interview -
with The Michigan Daily, University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman said the events will
give an opportunity for the 40,000 alumni
in California to meet with the leaders of the
University, furtheringtrust in the University.
While it's important for the University to net-
work and fundraise with alumni, visiting for-
mal gatherings in lieu of a public meeting is
misguided. The regents may be interested in
building confidence with California's alumni,
but their primary job is to build that trust
back in Michigan.
The trip does have laudable goals, from
learning about state funding to possibly
investing in MOOCs. However, it comes at
the wrong time and sends a message of exclu-
sion. The regents first and foremost need to be
accessible to those whom they represent: stu-
dents and the public. Private meetings in Los
Angeles certainly don't accomplish this.

used to worship the Detroit
Pistons. I'd watch every game,
read the sports section of The
Detroit Free
Press while eat-
ing my cereal
every morning,
and visit the
players' web-
sites much too
frequently. But
then on Nov. 19,
2004,I watched ADRIENNE
the infamous ROBERTS
Pistons-Pacers
brawl where
Ron Artest, a player from the Pac-
ers, went into the stands and start-
ed punching a fan.
I think it was at that moment that
I realized these players weren't nec-
essarily heroes, or at the very least
they weren't people I should see as
role models. Some have overcome
incredible circumstances to make
it to where they are today, but oth-
ers haven't. They can be complacent,
angry and rude just like anyone else.
The only difference is that they get
paid millions upon millions per year.
So when the story broke Wednes-
day that Manti Te'o, a linebacker
from University of Notre Dame, was
a pawn in an elaborate Internet hoax,
many people seemed to take the
story at face value. They were sur-
prised that he was trusting enough
to believe he had a girlfriend he had
never seen in person, but few were
skeptical, which is concerning con-
sidering how much he profited from
this "heartwarming" story. From
Te'o to Lance Armstrong, stories of
athletes lying about their past for
professional gain seem to be appear
on a weekly basis.
According to Sports Illustrated,
Te'o learned of the death of his grand-
mother and his girlfriend within the
span of six hours in September. He
went on to help his team beat Michi-
gan State, finishing the game with
12 tackles. Numerous stories with
the "triumph under extreme situa-
tions" storyline were written about
him. That's not surprising, but the

fact is that his relationship consisted
of tweets, text messages and phone
calls. It's astonishing that not one
.reporter looked into this before they
wrote the original stories about the
romance and heartbreak.
The details remain unclear at
this point. Why did Notre Dame
know about this on Dec. 26 and not
say anything? Were they really try-
ing to preserve their legacy for just
a few more weeks? How much did
Te'o really know? Could he possi-
bly be more involved with the hoax
than we'd like to think?
Regardless, someone felt like
they had to sell a heartwarming,
against-all-odds story to either
themselves or the public. Notre
Dame most likely felt the need
to protect Te'o's sob story for as
long as possible. The media pub-
lished Te'o's story in the first place
because it's the kind of story their
readers would want to see. And
Te'o felt the need to tell his story to
elicit sympathy and give himself an
emotional backstory that may have
a positive effect on his future foot-
ball career.
This kind of narrative about an
athlete can be found everywhere.
It certainly happens here. Denard
Robinson isn't just a talented foot-
ball player: He's well-liked, comes
from a close family and makes an
effort to be friendly to. students.
Everyone loves readingsq story that
proves just how good of a person he
is. We demand these personal sto-
ries from the media. When you feel
as though you connect to a player
and respect them as a human being,
the game means so much more.
But, to get stories like these, fact-
checking is often ignored and stories
of heartbreak and heroism outweigh
the not-so-flattering truth. Trying
so desperately hard to find a "hero"
comes above all else. Yet, many ath-
letes have faults that the public and
media just don't seem comfortable
discussing or, for that matter, even
hearing. Athletes are a group that
we too rarely criticize for discre-
tions outside of their profession.

Maybe it's time we re-evaluate
how we think about athletes' worth
and how we judge them as players.
An "athlete's personal heartbreak
shouldn't affect how much media
attention he gets before the draft.
What should matter is his commit-
ment, work ethic and ability. That
should be the story. There shouldn't
be a demand to know an athlete's
relationship history and family val-
ues. Most people wouldn't feel com-
fortable selling the story of how
their grandmother and girlfriend
died within six hours of each other.
Te'o did, whether it was because he
wanted the media attention to fur-
ther his career, or because he sim-
ply just felt comfortable sharing it
with the world because every other
athlete does.
I realized that
atheletes aren't
necessarily
role models.
I had to learn this the hard way.
Players that I idolized - that I
assumed had overcome great odds
personally and professionally -
acted in a way that was completely
outrageous. Athletes at Michigan,
Notre Dame, and many others
schools all do things that no one
would be proud of, but we ignore it
to create a nice, clean narrative that
gives them the press they need to
further their careers. At the end of
the day, sports are all about a game
- a game involving highly skilled
and usually extremely dedicated
athletes - but a game nonetheless.
There are a million stories of people
overcoming personal adversity to
make it where they are today, but
stories like Te'o's simply aren't one
of these.

Kindness in face of tragedy

JESSE KLEIN
Blowing off sex education

In the days that followed the Sandy Hook
Elementary School shooting, a quote from Mis-
ter Rogerswent viral.
"When I was a boy and I would see scary
things in the news, my mother would say to
me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find
people who are helping.' To this day, especially
in times of 'disaster,' I remember my mother's
words and I am always comforted by realizing
that there are still so many helpers - so many
caring people in this world," Rogers said.
The words were comforting, and, for a
moment, we were brought back to our child-
hood dens where we sat and watched "Mister
Rogers' Neighborhood." In the wake of the
Sandy Hook shooting, the world has taken
Mr. Rogers' advice to heart. But instead of
looking for the helpers, people have become
the helpers.
We are inundated with articles sparking
debates about gun control, mental illness and
school safety. Our inboxes and newsfeeds are
flooded with the latest developments following
the shooting. Policies have been discussed and
analyzed, conspiracy theories have been creat-
ed and speeches condemning the attacks have
been made. Facebook statuses varying from
prayers to outcries of anger to calls for action
are everywhere, and Twitter feeds are full of
pleas for change. These reactions are under-
standable -the Sandy Hook tragedy has struck
a universal chord with people and is bound to
trigger feelings of every kind.
It's easy to get caught up in the anger, hurt
and fear that many people feel, especially
when we live in a world where we're constant-
ly bombarded with information. The news
may seem inescapable, especially right after
the shooting. There's a universal battle cry:
"We have to do something about this." And
we do. There's a lot that needs to be done to
ensure that a shooting of this magnitude never
happens again. But to say that we have to do

something without acknowledging the good-
ness that has come as a result of the shooting
discredits the greatest thing that we've done
so far: we have put aside our differences to
show compassion to one another.
At a time when there seems to be no words
for what happened, acts of kindness speak
the loudest. In the days following the shoot-
ing, people showed overwhelming displays of
empathy both big and small. Prayers were said,
flags were flown atnhalf-mast, basketball players
observed moments of silence for the victims,
and a children's choir performed on Saturday
Night Live in place of the show's standard open-
ing. JetBlue delivered farewell letters to one of
the slain children and then offered free travel to
the loved ones of the victims. When Ann Curry
asked people to do 20 random acts of kindness
for each of the children who died, people com-
mitted 26 acts of kindness for every person
who died instead. Some surprised construction
workers with coffee, while others bought 26
toys for needy children. And these are only the
acts of kindness that have made the news.
But these acts of solidarity are not limited
to the United States. Around the world, people
have shown incredible feats of sympathy for
the victims. In Pakistan, children held up a
sign that said, "We feel your pain as you would
feel our pain." In Brazil, people placed crosses
in the sand for each of the victims, while in
Scotland, soccer players observed a moment of
silence in solidarity. In Russia, people left flow-
ers and teddy bears outside the US embassy.
If there's one thing this tragedy has shown
us, it's that our strength lies in our kindness
toward others. For every person who commits
these terrible crimes, there are at least a hun-
dred helpers. Despite the tragedy that we have
seen, these acts of kindness show that it can
still be a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

At the 70th annual Golden
Globes, the HBO series "Girls" took
home some big awards, including
Best Actress in a TV Comedy for
Lena Dunham and Best TV Com-
edy. The show has been both criti-
cized and praised for its honest
portrayal of 20-something women
who supposedly exemplify our
generation. Most of the contro-
versy surrounds the awkward and
sometimes extremely disturbing
sex scenes. While these sex scenes
include weird fantasies, masturba-
tion and jerks who only care about
gettingthemselves off, they're lack-
ing in one area that seems absent
from almost every television show,
movie and media exposure in gen-
eral: oral sex and hand jobs. While
oral sex has made appearances
in "Game of Thrones" and in one
scene of "Girls," sexual acts beyond
vaginal intercourse are rarely seen
or insinuated.
From teen dramas like "Gos-
sip Girl" and "Glee," to reality TV
shows in the "Jersey Shore" genre
and even to highly respected mov-
ies, any mention of non-coital sexu-
al activity is inexplicably left out of
scripts. Even more puzzling is the
leap many of these TV shows make
from making out to intercourse.
The fall-out-of-frame-onto-bed
that usually indicates sex is only
preceded by hot make-out sessions
- an unrealistic jump in reality
that doesn't necessarily match up
with off-screen sexual progression.
College can be one of the most
promiscuous times for young
adults, and with advancements in
birth control, young women may
have hit their sexually liberated
peak. While this may point to an
increase in a young person's sex

life, the age when the average per-
son loses their virginity is actually
rising. According to the Centers.for
Disease Control, in 1991, 54.1 per-
cent of high school students had
lost their virginity. A decade later,
only 47.4 percent of high school stu-
dents had done the deed.
While traditional sex may appear
to be on the decline, oral sex is
growing in popularity among young
adults. 41 percent of females and
47 percent of males, ages 15 to 19
have participated in oral sex, which
increases to 80 percent for ages 20
to 24. While vaginal intercourse
decreased in the past two decades,
sexually transmitted infections
that can be transferred by oral sex
didn't. This points to the probabil-
ity that teens are foregoing vaginal
intercourse for oral sex.
Many young adults choose this
type of sexual contact because they
believe is it safer, both emotion-
ally and physically. When it comes
to casual sexual encounters, many
young people feel more comfortable
having oral sex or fondling than
having intercourse. In 2002, 22 per-
cent of females and 24 percent of
males reported having oral sex but
had not lost their virginity. In 2011,
49 percent of non-Hispanic white
females had oral sex before vaginal
sex, compared to 40 percent who
had oral sex after intercourse. 44
percent of non-Hispanic males had
oral sex before intercourse, com-
pared with 36 percent of males that
had oral sex after intercourse.
A noteworthy exception in this
trend is found in black and Hispan-
ic adults, where a majority of adults
between the ages of 15 and 24 had
intercourse before oral sex.
There wasn't even data on hand

jobs from the CDC. Though it's
discussed often in social environ-
ments, research and media expo-
sure of this part of our generation's
sex life is completely lacking.
This change in sexual progres-
sion demonstrates a changing
mentality for Millennials. While
virginity has been put on a pedestal
only to be given to someone special,
oral sex and fondling has become
a socially acceptable alternative.
However, this was not the case in
past decades. For many older gen-
erations, oral sex was considered
more intimate than vaginal sex.
It's surprising that a large part
of a young adult's sex life has been
left out media, and especially sur-
prising that it lacks mention in
research, statistics and education.
In my high school's sex ed classes,
vaginal intercourse was repeatedly
expressed to be an important deci-
sion to be made between partners.
The physical and emotional conse-
quences of oral sex and other types
of "non-traditional" sex were never
discussed and still aren't today.
The lack of communication about
these topics increases the perception
that anything that isn't intercourse
isn't important, special or possibly
damaging. I learned about the STDs
that could be transferred from vagi-
nal sex but none from oral sex. We all
heard statistics that most people who
lose their virginity before 18 regret
not waiting. But other sexual acts
were never discussed. Even though
these subjects are freely expressed
in any college dorm room, there's
still a taboo surrounding them out-
side of the gossip sphere.

"Dude, are you wearing heels?"
Predictable Cruise

'Reacher' relies
too heavily on its
leading man
By MATT EASTON
Daily Arts Writer
"Jack Reacher" might as well
be called "Tom Cruise." No audi-
ence in America will gasp when
Cruise makes
his appearance
10 minutes into
the movie; few Jack
people will Reacher,
expect him
to transform At Quality16
beyond ret- and Rave
ognition into
a compelling Paramount
role (a la Daniel
Day-Lewis in everything or, well,
Cruise in "Tropic Thunder"). This
is a Tom Cruise action movie,
which means you already know
90 percent of what you need to
know.
This, for people who want to
attend entertaining movies, is
perfectly OK if Cruise carries out
his end of the bargain. The bar-
gain being that Cruise remains
compelling to watch - an essen-
tial skill for any actor, but his life-
blood.
In "Jack Reacher," Cruise's
physical stunts only dimin-
ish slightly from his previous
work. At moments, his silhouette
seems borrowed from the "Mis-
sion: Impossible" franchise (the
prominent nose and tuft of hair),
which makes it less striking, but

his steadicam scenes of combat
and movement occasionally seem
fresh. Fresh may be an inappro-
priate word though, as "Reacher"
seems to reach back toward the
past for its action tropes. The
fighting is direct and realistic
without the crutch of shaky-cam;
the car-chase scenes are loaded
with skidding and minor bumps -
creating chaotic, screeching ten-
sion. Perhaps most wonderfully,
the gun fights ring with hundreds
of missed bullets as combatants
dash for strategic cover. It's more
"duck and cover" than "kill hun-
dreds of bad guys."
Beyond the physical is the
more-intriguing mental state of
Cruise. In his movies, there has
always been a sense of detach-
ment, with perhaps a glimmer of
some erratic behavior. The "cool"
in Cruise comes from the detach-
ment, the "compelling" comes
from his sudden, wry humor. In
"Jack Reacher," he nails detach-
ment. Reacher is cold and calcu-
lating; even though he's hit on by
literally every woman in the film
(one wonders who added that to
the script), Reacher remains stoic
and untouchable.
It's in a similar vein to "The
Expendables" series, in which
bros help out the ladies not for
sexual gain but for a sense of
revenge or justice. This detach-
ment, though, provides a feel-
ing of something missing, of an
opportunity wasted. While it
makes sense within Reacher's
character (ex-military, extremely
diligent, justice-seeking, etc.),
there's still a nagging sensation

that Cruise could be doing a little
more, that he could not just say
funny lines (of which there are
plenty in this film) but also deliver
them in more humorous ways.
In "Reacher," one wishes Cruise
would give a "Risky Business"
smile, instead of just resting on a
stern "M.I" expression.
Beyond the leading-actor, "Jack
Reacher" also provides some
surprising roles. Rosamund Pike
("Wrath of the Titans") is excel-
lent as a lawyer providing a flick-
ering love interest for Reacher.
There's a dignity in Pike's char-
acterization, a determination and
regality that is powerful and sexy
- it's refreshing to watch. Wer-
ner Herzog ("Cave of Forgotten
Dreams") completely chills as a
stubby crime lord. One particular
Herzog scene imagines one of the
more horrific choices someone
pushed to the edge would have to
make (think self-cannibalization).
Lastly, Robert Duvall ("Get Low")
provides a much needed side-
kick for the titular character, and
proves old men can hang with the
young guys.
Modern times contain a lot of
self-depreciation, and movies are
catching on to this fact, especially
within the shoot-'em-up genre.
"Jack Reacher" understands this,
and it almost perfectly toes the
line between serious and come-
dic. Cruise ends up as the barom-
eter for the movie's success, and
while he wears the grim mask of
a soldier driven toward justice
quite well, one wishes it would
occasionally slip off to reveal a
grin underneath.

'CatfishW keeps viewers
hooked with r eal drama

By RADHIKA MENON
Daily Arts Writer
MTV has long been the net-
work with questionable youth-
oriented programming: From the
addicting abomination "Jersey
Shore" to the prissy and entitled
"My Super Sweet Sixteen" to the
new, borderline-offensive "Buck-
wild," there is no doubt that MTV
knows its audience.
Reality shows - particularly
on MTV - get a bad rap for their
heightened dramatics and glorifi-
cation of untraditional lifestyles
(really, there's nowhere else on
television where you will find
such fame in being a teenage par-
ent). Critics love to rip on a show
with trashy characters (a la Snoo-
ki taking part in irrational behav-
ior), and for good reason. Those
shows, while entertaining, don't
add much to the cultural memory
of this generation beyond embar-,
rassment forus normal folk.
However, one of the network's
newest ventures, "Catfish: The
TV Show," is decidedly un-MTV.
Where other programming
focused much of its energy on
unnecessary drama and fist-
fights, "Catfish" works on a more
humanistic level, bringing the
network back down to reality.
For those who haven't been
swept up by the docu-show (or
who avoid MTV like the plague),
"Catfish" discusses online rela-
tionships that have been forged
largely through social media.
Taken from host Nev Schulman's
own experience, being "catfished"
is to be duped into believing that

'Banshee' lacks own identity

By ALEC STERN

HBO passed.
What "Banshee" does do right
is establish a tone early on. Even
before the opening credit sequence
rolls, there's sex, violence and a
car chase through New York City.
The action genre has worked for
Cinemax in the past with original
series "Strike Back," and it's clear
they have stuck with the familiar
for this project as well.
The protagonist (newcomer
Antony Starr) is anunnamed crim-
inal recently released from prison
who later assumes the identity of
Lucas Hood. But first, he tracks
down past love, Carrie (Ivana
Milicevic, "Vegas"), to Banshee,
Pa. Not only does Hood learn that
Carrie's married with two chil-
dren, but she doesn't even have the
10-million dollars worth of dia-
monds she was supposed to save
for him. With nowhere to go, Hood
ends up in a bar owned by former
boxer Sugar Bates (Frankie Fai-
son, "The Silence of the Lambs").
The two bond over whiskey and a
common prison stint until the real

A couple of missed penalty

But this time around, things
will be different. Well, that's easy
to say, right?
I'm not the only one saying it.
Michigan coach Matt Anderson
is confident in this year's group,
focusing in on the season goal,
among others, to be a part of
the final eight teams left in this
year's NCAA Tournament.
"We always want to do better
than we did before," Anderson
said. "Each team wants to set a
new standard and a new legacy.
To me, I want to be playing in the
final eight in Harvard."
Anderson persistently stresses
consistency and, along with that,
continuous improvements each

players - to be invited to the
MLS Combine in Florida on Jan.
11-15.
There, he put the memory
of a disappointing junior cam-
paign in 2011 and a senior sea-
son marred by injuries behind
him, and impressed scouts dur-
ing the tryout. Speaking before
the draft, Opare expressed his
desire to play professional soc-
cer.
"I want to see how far I
can play," he said Wednesday.
"Hopefully it's the MLS."
When he got to the Combine,
though, Opare felt nervous. But
once he stepped onto the soccer
field, the jitters disappeared.
"I realized, 'OK, this is soc-
cer,' he said. "We play for the
joy of our lives. Let's go out and
have fun."
It worked. As defenders were
taken off the board in the first
round of the draft, ESPN listed
Opare as one of-the best remain-
ing central defenders. Then, the
good news came: Opare wasn't
going to Toronto or Montreal,
teams that struggled in 2012. He
was joining the Galaxy, the two-
time defending MLS Cup Cham-
pions.
"I'm very excited and hon-
ored to represent the University
of Michigan on the professional
level," Opare said. "It is a dream
come true and something I have
looked forward to since I was
young. Representing the Los
Angeles Galaxy is something I
am truly looking forward to."
Opare started 71 matches in
his collegiate career and played
in more contests than all but 12
players in program history. He
also ranks fifth in program his-
tory for minutes played - 6,411
- and was a captain as a senior
and defensive MVP in 2011. His
teammates in Los Angeles will
include Landon Donovan, argu-
ably the best American player of
all time.
"This is an exciting day for
Kofi and the Michigan men's
soccer program," said Michi-
gan coach Chaka Daley in a
statement to the Daily. "We are
pleased to have one of our own
go to a perennial MLS power
like the LA Galaxy."
Los Angeles already has a
starting center back in Omar
Gonzales, and it bolstered its
defense by drafting defender
Tommy Meyer from Indiana in
2012.
But the Galaxy selected two
defenders on Thursday, perhaps
in preparation for the retirement
of aging stars. Former Michigan
coach Steve Burns believes that
Opare has both the physical
capacity and the work ethic to
make an impact at the profes-
sional level.
"I think he's a good learner
and a student of the game,"
Burns said. "He watches it from
the eyes of a pro. Whether or not
he can make a roster is a differ-
ent story. He has to go out there
and prove it."

that this year's
team - sitting
towards the bottom of the CCHA
with a 4-10-2 conference record
- can make strides in Sault Ste.
Marie. !
"I think we're challenged and
we're pushing," Berenson said.
"We're trying to get this train
back on the tracks. It's not the
start of the season, but we've got
to start somewhere. Right now,
we're going to try and make it a
new start."
There's been so much nega-

tive attention surrounding the
program the past few months, so
forgive Berenson if he tries to find
any kind of positive aspects head-
ing into the weekend.
But there have been some posi-
tives. Though the overall team
results haven't been anywhere
near Michigan's usually high
standards, there have still been a
few bright spots and commend-
able individual efforts across the
board.
Three forwards - senior Kevin
Lynch, sophomore Zach Hyman
and freshman Andrew Copp -
were singled out as players who
have effectively created offensive
opportunities, forechecked well
and battled hard, even wvithout
the puck. However, as Berenson
points out, it doesn't matter what
these players are doing well, if
the rest of the Wolverines can't
build off the available chances.
Still, he's trying to walk the line
between being harsh enough
while not being disparaging.
"Anything (the players) get is
somethingthey deserved," Beren-
son said. "If you start getting per-
sonal with them, the only thing
they can go on is what they've
done, and I think it's pretty clear
that it's not good enough. This
team is going to have to suck it up
and take the heat."
The freshman class is the one
expected to suck it up the most.
In the past, rookie standouts have
usually been the ones to carry

the forward corps. With Copp
already carrying a lot of the offen-
sive grunt work and forward Boo
Nieves tied for second in the team
for points, Berenson is looking to
them to continue and enhance
their already high standard of
play.
Michigan usually prefers to
have the brunt of the road trips
comes in the first half of the sea-
son - that way the team can build
camaraderie while traveling early
in the year, and then use that to
finish out the season strong with
a majority of homestands.
Instead, the Wolverines have
just three more games at Yost
Ice Arena this season, though
they know they haven't taken full
advantage of home ice. And yet,
they still have yet to register a win
on the road this season - a chal-
lenge that won't be made easier
by the fact that the Lakers hold a
marginal 22-18-3 series lead over
Michigan when playing in Taffy
Abel Arena.
None ofthe Wolverines want to
admit that leaving Ann Arbor for
a series could be a good thing, but
at this point, any kind of variation
could be an effective catalyst for
change.
"Going on the road, that's all
you have, seeing your team," said
senior forward A.J. Treais. "You
don't have any fans in your favor
... all you've got is your buddies,
and maybe that's something that
can change (the season)."

What I learnedfrom
Adidas in Minneapolis

MINNEAPOLIS -
Four of Michigan's blue
road jerseys ripped in the
Wolverines' 83-75 win
over Minnesota Wednesday.
Impossible is nothing, right,
Adidas?
Trey Burke's No. 3 was the
first to rip, so he played most of
the game wearing No. 12, which
was also
ripped
later in the
game. So
after Jor-
dan Mor-
gan used
Michigan's
second and
only other
extra jersey DANIEL
- the red- WASSERMAN
shirt junior
played the
second half wearing No. 30-
Burke and, later, Caris LeVert
were forced to play with holes in
their uniforms.
I can't remember the last time
the Wolverines beat a top-10
opponent on the road after four
of its jerseys were ripped since
no official statistics are kept on
road games won with ripped
jerseys. I can assure you, though,
that no Michigan team has won
a road game over a top-10 team
since the Wolverines beat No.
10 Duke, 62-61, on Dec. 8,1996
until Wednesday. That was more
than 16 years ago.
Impossible is nothing.
A response
Michigan blew its chance at
the No.1 ranking after playing
a dud of a first half last Sunday
against Ohio State. The lingering
question before that game -
could the young Michigan squad
win ina hostile road atmosphere
against an equally talented

roster? - only magnified in the
days after. No longer was it just
a whisper, a hypothetical, it
became something the Wolver-
ines needed to answer.
"When you don't lose very
often, they really hit hard,"
Michigan coach John Beilein
admitted Wednesday, which is
why he said the film sessions
following the loss to the Buck-
eyes were held ina positive
light.
"This is what we've been
waiting for - try to find ways
to get better, because you don't
necessarily become better if you
win by 20 points. You get better
when you get it handed to you
like we did in Columbus."
And they did.
In Columbus, Ohio State
jumped out to a 21-point lead
before the Wolverines mounted
their comeback. Tim Hardaway
Jr. was held to just 12 points on
5-of-15 shooting, so Hardaway's
message to his team heading into
Minneapolis was that from the
moment it stepped off the plane
Tuesday night, prepare to play
like you're down 10 points.
Hardaway did, bouncing back
from his rough outing Sunday
to score 17 first-half points, pro-
pelling Michigan to a six-point
halftime lead.
The Wolverines might strug-
gle to conjure up that type of
chip on their shoulder in every
game, but hey, impossible is
nothing.
Flying high
Michigan's first-half momen-
tum turned into a second-half
steamroller out of the gates.
At the 13:42 mark, Glenn Rob-
inson III stole a lazy Minnesota
pass near halfcourt, dribbled
uncontested up the floor, and
effortlessly slammed home a

360-degree dunk.
The dunk, which ESPN imme-
diately nominated as a Top-10
play of the day, gave the Wolver-
ines a 19-point lead, their largest
of the night.
In his press conference,
Beilein couldn't hold back a
smile while sayingthat he wasn't
judging the dunk, or giving it
any score, from his spot on the
sidelines. But when asked if
beating a top-10 team on the
road for the first time since
1996 meant anything to him, his
immediate response was no, and
there weren't any smiles to go
along with the answer.
Every time he's talked, Beilein
has seemingly failed to let any
historical landmark that this
team has reached sink in, and
this answer appeared to be no
different. But then he paused,
and something in the coach's
mind clicked, sparking a more
pointed answer.
"You know what it means?" he
asked, hesitating again. "If you
look at this season, this season
right now, we're going to have to
do something out of the ordinary
to be in the Big Ten hunt."
Michigan just did. Eventual
Big Ten champions need wins
like the Wolverines got Thurs-
day in a raucous environment,.
against the No. 9 team in Ameri-
ca, on national television in what
some said was Minnesota's big-
gest home game since the '70s.
And it did so with authority. And
with ripped.jerseys.
"We've got our confidence
back," Burke said afterwards
with a smile.
And for a confident Michigan
team, impossible is nothing.

Wolverines blow
out Northwestern
to extend program-
best streak
By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Looking to extend a series
of winning streaks, the No.
25 Michigan women's basket-
ball team took on Northwest-
ern (0-4 Big Ten, 8-9 overall)
Thursday
night in MICHGAN 67
its first N'WESTERN 53
game as a
ranked team since 2002. Play-
ing against a team that hd a
clear height advantage with
nine players over six feet tall,
the Wolverines (4-0, 15-2)
relied on their quickness and
shooting from deep to beat the
Wildcats, 67-53, and continue
the program's best start ever.
After failingto makesat least
one 3-pointer in its last game
against Wisconsin, senior
forward Kate Thompson got
back to her old ways, connect-
ing from deep 28 seconds into
the game to open up the scor-
ing. Thompson wasn't close to
done, though, and she finished
with a team-leading 23 points,
including seven 3-pointers -
a career-high and program
record. She helped Michigan
win its tenth-straight game
-tying its longest winning
streak ever. The victory also
pushed the team's best con-
ference start to four straight
victories. -
"Coach set me down and
told me that I have to be confi-
dent and just shoot the ball and
not think about it," Thompson
said. "Jenny (Ryan) was really
finding me. Nya (Jordan) was
setting great screens. I have a
really great team around me."
The Wolverines started
the game hot, outscoring
Northwestern 11-2, before the
Wildcats called a timeout to
attempt to cool Michigan's siz-
zling start.
The hotness carried over to
the second half, as the team
shot 45 percent from the field
for the game and never trailed.
The Wolverines managed to
overcome their obvious height
disadvantage to outscore
Northwestern in the first half,
29-23, including 10-6 in the
paint.
Led by Jordan and her six
first-half points, the Wolver-
ines' bigs were able to score 17
first-half points.
Senior forwards Rachel
Sheffer and Sam Arnold also
added four first-half points
each, taking advantage of the
early foul trouble of Wildcats'
leading scorer Kendall Hack-
ney, who only managed seven
points and one rebound in the
first half and 18 points and two
rebounds for the game.
Though Hackney's foul
trouble helped Michigan keep
the rebounding even in the
first half, another key factor
to its early success was its bal-
anced scoring from its starters
and Arnold.

It seemed that Northwest-
ern, after scoring the last four
points of the first half, could

challenge the Wolverines in the
second half.
But Michigan once again
started the half hot, scoring the
first eight points of the stanza,
beginning with a 3-pointer by
Thompson - just as she did to
start the game.
"We noticed at the end of the
first half that we started to get a
little bit lazy," Jordan said.
Unlike their last game, in
which Ryan was their lone dou-
ble-digit scorer with a career-
high 19 points, the Wolverines'
were able to divide up the scor-
ing.
Two players scored over ten
points - Jordan had 12 - as
well as eight apiece for Arnold
and sophomore guard Nicole
Elmblad.
But it was Thompson who
stole the show, making four
3-pointers in the first seven
minutes of the second half to
extend both Michigan's lead
and her nnitoa+to 1

"I thought Kate was tremen-
dous," said Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico. "And obvi-
ously she can't do it without her
teammates."
From that point onward,
the game was all but over as
the Wolverines' lead never fell
below double-digits following
their initial run to start the
half.
Thompson's prowess from
deep wasn't the only thing that
powered Michigan to a con-
vincing victory. After matching
the Wildcats with 16 rebounds
in the first half, the Wolverines
outrebounded Northwestern,
24-9, in the second stanza -
good for a 40-25 advantage for
the game. Elmblad led the team
nine rebounds, while Jordan
had eight.
"We really put an emphasis
on our rebounding," Barnes
Arico said. "It's nice when you
come out and you outrebound
+the y1 o u e."

Senior forward Kate Thompson hita school-record seven 3-nointers Thursday.

GOING,
TO THE


BASKETBALL
From Page 1A
ence opponent - confident
and poised - was a complete
turnaround to how it fared
against the Buckeyes, and was
exactly what Michigan coach
John Beilein wanted to see from
his team in yet another hostile
environment.
"Winning road games in this
league (is important)," Beilein
said. "In the past, there were
maybe three ranked teams,
maybe four. With Wisconsin's
win (over Indiana on Tues-
day), you're going to have seven
ranked teams very soon.
"There's seven games you
have to win against ranked
teams on the road. That doesn't
happen very often. So as a result,
when you get them, they're really
important (to win) if you're going
to stay on the top of the (Big Ten)

standings."
But at the beginning of the
game, the Wolverines didn't look
like they were playing to earn a
statement conference win on the
road. Minnesota forward Trevor
Mbakwe fired up the crowd early
with two consecutive blocks on
redshirt junior forward Jordan
Morgan. In response, Hardaway
Jr. and Burke sparked the perim-
eter offense for Michigan.
Hardaway, who had a similar
performance his freshman year
in Minnesota, tallied 17 first-half
points, 12 of which came from
beyond the arc, on 6-of-7 shoot-
ing. He was often found open on
the wing, and the extra passes
by Burke or freshman guard Nik
Stauskas found Hardaway open
for the bucket.
Hardaway cooled off in the
second .half, finishing with 21
points on 7-of-8 shooting.
Burke also took control of the
game early, shedding his defend-

er to be able to penetrate and
kick out, something he wasn't
able to do against Aaron Craft
and Ohio State. The sophomore
point guard - wearing No. 12
after his usual No. 3 was ripped
early in the game - dished out
nine assists and added 18 points
while playing basically an error-
free game against a tough Min-
nesota defense.
And though Hardaway,
Burke, and the rest of the guards
accounted for 57 points, Mbakwe
wasn't able to silence Morgan
and the forwards for the entire
game.
After Morgan was stuffed in
the paint early, freshman for-
ward Mitch McGary entered the
game and let his presence be felt.
The 6-foot-10 big man was
able to keep pace with Mbakwe,
tallying eight points and even
had three steals.
Morgan reestablished himself
in the second half and finished

with nine points, four rebounds
and a ripped jersey, and both big
men were able to overcome the
physicality of the post to help out
in the win.
"Guys were out there, we were
out there in the war, we had to
stick it out in the second half,"
Barke said.
Added Hardaway: "It's Big
Ten season, everybody's going to
be physical, everybody's trying
to win."
Thursday's win was Michi-
gan's first win against a top-10
team on the road since 1996, but
Beilein doesn't think getting any
more road wins will be easier,
espetially with the competitive-
ness of the conference.
"If you look at this season,
right now, we're going to have to
do that - something out of the
ordinary - to be in the Big Ten
hunt. Anybody in this league is
going to have to do that to be in
the Big Ten hunt," he said.
