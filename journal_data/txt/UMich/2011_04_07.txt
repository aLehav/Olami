invasion of privacy
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily News Editor
Former Michigan Student
Assembly President Chris Arm-
strong filed a lawsuit against
Andrew Shirvell, a former
Michigan assistant attorney
general, on Friday alleging that
Shirvell stalked him, invaded
his privacy and defamed him.
The lawsuit, which was filed
in the Washtenaw County Cir-
cuit Court, alleges that Shirvell
"developed a bizarre personal
obsession with (Armstrong)."
Armstrong is seeking dam-
ages in excess of $25,000 from
Shirvell. u
Deborah Gordon, Arm-
strong's attorney, said in an
interview yesterday that the
intent of the lawsuit is to have
Shirvell retract false statements
he has made about Armstrong.
"The complaint... is filled with
line after line of direct blatant
lies about Chris Armstrong,"
Gordon said. "(Shirvell) refuses
to retract his statements, much
less apologize. So we can sit idly

by or we can sue him, and we've
made the decision to sue him."
Several allegedly false state-
ments made by Shirvell are
listed in the lawsuit, includ-
ing anti-homosexual and racist
claims Shirvell made against
Armstrong on his blog "Chris
Armstrong Watch." Shirvell
started his blog last April and
wrote on the website that Arm-
strong was pursuing a "radical
homosexual agenda" in his role
as MSA president. Armstrong,
whose one-year term as MSA
president ended earlier this
week, was the first openly gay
president of the assembly.
Shirvell also protested at sev-
eral MSA meetings and outside
of Armstrong's house in Ann
Arbor last year.
In a separate document also
filed Friday, Gordon requested
that the case be decided by a
jury.
"It's very important that this
be tried in front of the jury and
the community," Gordon said
in the interview yesterday. "We
want the community's opinion
as represented by the jury."

In bankruptcy,
company looking
to save money
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Borders Group Inc. will be
moving away from its South
State Street headquarters after
40 years of business.

Borders spokeswoman Mary
Davis wrote in a statement that
the Ann Arbor-based company
is looking for a new home for its
headquarters several reasons.
"We have determined that
our current headquarters does
not serve the needs of our
business going forward, and
represents a cost that can be
reduced," Davis wrote. "There-
fore we will be exploring
opportunities to relocate our

headquarters within the great-
er metropolitan Detroit area
to a more cost effective loca-
tion, mindful of our corporate
employees' commute and other
factors."
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje said he would be sad to see
the Borders headquarters relo-
cate because of its local roots.
Borders was established here in
1971by brothers Tom and Louis
Borders.

"I think there is something
about Borders's connection to
the people here," Hieftje said.
Borders Group Inc. filed for
Chapter tl bankruptcy protec-
tion in February and announced
at the time that the company
will be closing about 200 of its
642 stores across the country.

In an effort to take lesson plans
about the international market

its partnerships with companies

on the other side of the globe.
The school intends to cre-
ate programs in which Business
students and faculty work with

firsthand about global business,
according to a University press
release issued last week. As part
of the initiative, the school will
create a partnership with the
Confederation of Indian Indus-

association.
The partnership, which will

involve the Business School's
C.K. Prahalad Initiative, is also
aimed at expanding the Busi-
ness School's global presence and
helping CII's India@75 organiza-
tion achieve its goals. India@75 is
a project based on a speech given
by late Business School Prof. C.K.

The group discusses an array

Drug cartels in Mexico
becomn more dangerous

Cartels recruiting
low-level criminals,
training them to
be killers
CANCUN, Mexico (AP) -
Drug cartels are increasingly
recruiting common criminals
and quickly convertingthem into
killers, the head of Mexico's fed-
eral police said yesterday.
Public Safety Secretary Gen-
aro Garcia Luna said new drug
cartel recruits can reach the
position of hit man in a month,
a process that used to take 15
years.
Garcia Luna said his agency
has began combatting common
crime as it fights drug cartels in
response to the changing nature

of organized crime in Mexico.
"For too long the fight against
organized crime has been con-
centrated on the leadership and
now it's important to fight crime
at every stage," Garcia Luna
told representatives from more
than 100 countries attending the
annual International Conference
for Drug Control.
The drug cartels are recruit-
ing low-level lawbreakers such
as street drug dealers and rob-
bers, a tactic first used by the
brutal Zetas drug gang and now
being copied by other cartels.
The Zetas, originally ex-
soldiers acting as hit men for
Mexico's Gulf drug cartel before
breaking off on their own, have
no geographic concentration like
other cartels and therefore have
shown up in disparate parts of
the country, authorities said.

They operate almost like fran-
chises, sending one member to
an area they want to control to
recruit local criminals.
Officials at the drug control
conference say the Zetas have
now spread their reign of terror
from the border with the United
States to the border with Guate-
mala - and across it.
Guatemala Security Vice Min-
ister Mario Castaneda said the
Zetas are recruiting former elite
Guatemalan soldiers and train-
ing them in camps in the Central
American country.
At least six former "kaibiles"
- Guatemalan soldiers trained
in counterinsurgency - linked to
the Zetas have been arrested in
Guatemala, Castaneda said.
Mexico first warned in 2005
that the Zetas were recruiting
"kaibiles."

Seven U.N. workers
killed after Taliban
opens fire on crowds
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- Former insurgents who had
renounced the Taliban and were
in a reintegration program are
suspected of taking an assault
rifle from a Nepalese guard and
opening fire during the anti-
Quran-burning riot last week
that left seven U.N. workers
dead, Afghan officials said yes-
terday.
Parliamentarian Mohammad,
Akbari said government investi-
gators have identified three men
they believe were involved in the
killing of three U.N. staff mem-
bers and four Nepalese guards
in the April 1 attack against the
U.N. headquarters in the north-
ern city of Mazar-i-Sharif. Four
protesters also were killed.
The men were arrested the
day of the riot. It began as a
peaceful demonstration, but
after crowds stormed the build-
ing and set fires, some protest-

ers seized weapons and started
shooting.
"They had one Kalashnikov
which they took from a guard.
They fired, according to wit-
nesses," said Akbari, who was
part of the investigating team.
"They have been recognized by
witnesses."
He did not say how many peo-
ple the suspects are thought to
have killed. It remains unclear
how the protesters died.
A chief investigator with
the Interior Ministry, Mirza
Mohammad Yarmand, said
one of the men disassembled
the AK-47 and took it back to
the house where he was stay-
ing. The weapon, he said, was
found.
It was unclear who is thought
to have done the shooting or
if more than one weapon was
involved. At least one U.N. staff-
er was killed with a knife to the
throat.
Yarmand said two suspects
were believed to be directly
involved, and that there was
evidence that they fired the
weapon. The role of the third

was unclear.
Akbari said the suspects were
former insurgents who had
renounced the Taliban and were
in a reintegration program. He
said all three were from Balkh
province, of which Mazar-i-
Sharif is the capital.
The program aims to attract
low- to midlevel fighters to join
the government with promises
of jobs, literacy and vocational
training plus development aid
for their villages.
In February, a NATO official
said that nearly 900 militants
had quit the fight and enrolled
in the program. The Afghan
government has not confirmed
that number. There are vary-
ing estimates of the number of
insurgents fighting in Afghani-
stan, but the most often quoted
estimate is 25,000.
Neither Akbari nor Yarmand
provided further detail, but
both said the men have denied
killing anyone. No one has been
charged as the investigation is
still under way, they said. A total
of 17 men were being questioned
in connection with the riot.

Human rights groups as well
as the U.S., Britain and the Euro-
pean Union delegation in Beijing
have expressed concern about Ai
Weiwei, an avant-garde artist and
outspoken government critic who
was last seen early Sunday in police
custody after he was barred from
boarding a flight at a Beijing air-
port.
An editorial in the Global
Times newspaper, published by
the ruling Communist Party's
t

try.
Chinese law "won't bend to
mavericks," said the newspaper,
which didn't specify what laws
Ai was suspected of breaking or
confirm whether he had been
detained.
Ai's disappearance comes as
security services carry out a mas-
sive crackdown on lawyers, writ-
ers and activists following online
calls for protests in China similar
to those in the Middle East and
r

suggest that China is building a
criminal case against him for his
social activism.
Among China's best-known
artists internationally, Ai recently
exhibited at the Tate Modern gal-
lery in London.
As an activist, he has cam-
paigned for an independent
investigation into the deaths
of thousands of children when
schools collapsed in the massive
2008 Sichuan earthquake.

JUNEAU, Alaska
Alaska lawmaker
pushes for drinking
age to be lowered
Alaska is the latest state to
weigh in on a long-running argu-
ment: If you're old enough to fight
and die for your country, you
should be old enough to drink a
beer.
An Alaska lawmaker who
served in Vietnam is pushing a
bill that would allow active-duty
service members under 21 to
drink alcohol as long as they could
produce an armed forces identi-
fication card. Those under 19 -
Alaska's smoking age - would be
allowed to buy tobacco products.
"It's not fair that one guy in a
fox hole can go home and have a
beer while another guy in the fox
hole can't," said Rep. Bob Lynn,
R-Anchorage. "It's not about
drinking, it's not about smoking,
it's about equality. If you get shot
at, you can have a shot."
WASHINGTON, D.C.
White House says
shutdown will
delay pay to troops
The Obama administration
warned yesterday that a federal
shutdown would undermine the
economic recovery, delay pay to
U.S. troops fightingin three wars,
* slow the processing of tax returns
and limit smallbusiness loans and
government-backed mortgages
during peak home buying season.
The dire message, delivered
two days before the federal gov-
ernment's spending authority
expires, appeared aimed at jolting
congressional Republicans into
a budget compromise. Billions of
dollars apart, congressional nego-
tiators were working to strike
a deal by Friday to avert a shut-
down by setting spending limits
through the end of September.
The last such shutdown took place
15 years ago and lasted 21 days.

President Barack Obama tele-
phoned House Speaker John
Boehner on Wednesday, and
Boehner's office said the speaker
told Obama he was hopeful a deal
could be reached.

show, was jailed in the state of

Michigan in 1969 for selling two
marijuana joints to an under-
cover policewoman - resulting
in a 10-year prison sentence. His
imprisonment inspired the 1971
"Free John Now Rally" at Crisler
Arena that featured John Len-
non, who recorded a song titled
"John Sinclair" at the event. Sin-
clair's case led to redefining mar-
ijuana laws in Ann Arbor, and in
1972 an event similar to the rally,
then termed Hash Bash, took
place.
Additionally, Sinclair founded
the White Panther Party, which
supported the Black Panthers
during the Civil Rights Move-

updates.
"We know that our recre-
ational sports facilities need
improvement," Rullman said.
"We hear that from students."
Public Policy senior Stepha-
nie Parrish, a facilitator at the
event, said getting to North
Campus can be a hassle.
"There's not a convenient
way to get to the things that
are happening," Parrish said.
"If you have a busy schedule,
and you have an hour, it's not
worth it to ride the 20-minute
bus ride."
It's important North Campus
is "rebranded," Parrish said.
"It's a culture change," Par-
rish said. "... There's already
that culture that North Campus
is weird and far."
Kinesiology senior Andrew
Benintende said he goes to
North Campus because it has
quiet study spaces. However,
many of the buildings he likes
to frequent aren't accessible to
non-engineering students.
"Open up those buildings,"
Benintende said. "You can't get
in here on the weekends."
LSA senior Cameron MK-
Banerjee said.
The initiative's primary goal
is to "address the intersection
of business activity and social
responsibility," Gediman wrote.
The Business School began the
initiative this past fall in an effort
to honor Prahalad, who died last
April, and to carry on his vision
of business and his unique way
of thinking about the field, Gedi-
man said.
"I think it's important to say
that when you have somebody
like C.K. Prahalad, it's nice to
embrace the ambition of carry-
ing on his work as the best way
to honor his memory," Gediman
said.
The initiative - which will
be officially announced in the
coming weeks - will focus on
implementing the terms of the
memorandum between the Busi-
ness School and the CII. The first
step is starting a conversation,
Gediman said.
"India@75 is partnering with
us because we bring a certain
level of expertise ... and we're
partnering with them because
they will help us find projects
that offer the best educational
opportunities and research
opportunities to our faculty," he
said.
While this specific partner-
ship is new, the Business School
has already been engaged with
India for some time, Gediman
ment. He was also an active fig-
ure in the music scene duringthe
1960s as manager for the rock
band MCS.
Sinclair said he and other
activists at the time were moti-
vated by a desire to change the
way they lived.
"We didn't want to be like
everyone else," he said. "We
wanted to do something differ-
ent. We didn't know what it was
going to be, we just wanted to do
something different."
Sinclair said he believes
today's generation faces more
difficulty in creating social
change despite the existence of

the Internet and social media.
"You can do damn near any-
thing now, but nobody seems
to have any idea what to do," he
said.
Sinclair's visit was an unex-
pected addition to the class cur-
riculum, Conforth said. Sinclair
is an old friend of Conforth's, and
since he was in town for Hash
Bash this past Saturday, Con-
forth invited him to come speak
to his students about his experi-
ences.
"At this point in the class, we
just finished covering the sixties,
and the timing was just right,"
Conforth said.
In an interview after the class,

night said she regularly enjoys
the fine arts shows on North
Campus, but is concerned the
events aren't widely promoted.
"I've never seen an adver-
tisement for one that I remem-
ber," McKnight said.
She added that more park-
ing on North Campus would
encourage upperclassmen to
make the trip.
Public Policy junior Chris
Sorenson said he thinks the
campus should have more
activities for students.
"I think one way to increase
the liveliness of North Campus
is to add social events," Soren-
son said.
Elizabeth Zollweg, project
manager of the North Campus
Initiative, said she thinks the
event drew only a small crowd
since it was planned recently,
leaving the group little time to
fully market the event. Despite
the low turnout, Zollweg said it
was important to hold the event
before students began to study
for finals and became too busy.

said.
"We have six or seven student
teams in India right now doing
projects," he said.
Dolan wrote in the press
release that Indian citizens com-
prise 8 percent of the school's
MBA class of 2012.
Though this collaboration
focuses on India, the Business
School also plans to pursue simi-
lar programs in other countries
to expand its work abroad. Work-
ing with about 725 organizations
in more than 30 nations, the
Business School has orchestrated
more than 1,500 programs, the
press release states.
Gediman said the partner-
ship is also an example of what
the Business School sees as its
strength - combining business
with social and environmental
responsibility. He added that not
just the Business School, but the
University as a whole, will ben-
efit from the agreement.
"The kinds of organizations
you might be working with
aren't limited to business," Gedi-
man said. "The most interesting
problems of the world aren't just
business problems, so ultimately,
I could easily imagine that you
could have Ross students with
students from Public Policy and
Public Health and any of the
other schools ... working on field
projects that are Prahalad Initia-
tive field projects."
Sinclair said he enjoyed coming
to speak to Conforth's students
because he rarely gets the oppor-
tunity to communicate with col-
lege-aged individuals.
"I'm what I call a public intel-
lectual, and a historical figure -
if I can say that without meaning
to sound like an asshole," he said.
"I was witness to a lot of history
and a participant, and I just think
it's part of my job to respond to
requests to share this informa-
tion."
LSA senior Elan Green, a stu-
dent in the class, said he found
the talk to be interesting and
informative.

"He really helped embody
what we had already been dis-
cussing (in class) and take the
theory and apply it to reality,"
Green said.
LSA senior Allison Herbert,
who is also in the class, said she
had grown up with an origi-
nal poster from the "Free John
Now Rally" hanging in her living
room.
"A lot of people asked about
how our generation can fight
against this, how to do this,
do that in the world that we
live in," Herbert said. "It was
just cool to see his perspective
because he's been there and he's
done that."

representing Shirvell in the case
before the Attorney Grievance
Commission, said in an interview
yesterday that he isn't represent-
ing Shirvell in the civil lawsuit.
"I don't know if he could even
afford an'attorney," Thomas said.
Prior to filing the lawsuit,
Gordon and Armstrong filed
complaints with the Michigan
Attorney Grievance Commis-
sion in an effort to force Shirvell
to retract his statements against
Armstrong and to have Shirvell
disbarred.
Shirvell was fired from his
post in the Attorney Gener-
al's office last November "for
conduct unbecoming a state
employee," former Michigan
Attorney General Mike Cox
wrote in a statement at the time.
The incident became national
news last fall when Shirvell,
Armstrong and Cox appeared
on separate occasions on CNN's
Anderson Cooper 360.
Neither Armstrong nor
Shirvell could be reached for
comment yesterday.
Though Thomas isn't repre-
senting Shirvell in the lawsuit,
he said he has no doubts that
Shirvell will be acquitted of
wrongdoing.

also owns Waldenbooks, had

"While I'm not going to
be involved in the defense of
Andrew regarding the civil
lawsuit that Mr. Armstrong has
filed, I'm very confident that
when Andrew has his day in
court regarding that matter he
is going to prevail and that his
free speech rights are going to
be upheld," Thomas said.
Thomas added that while
Shirvell's actions may have been
offensive to some, he believes
Shirvell was well within his
First Amendment rights.
"While individuals may be
offended by things that Andrew
said on his blog and in the signs
that he would carry when he
protested certain events over on
campus, he had the right to be
there, and he had the right to do
that," Thomas said.
Shirvell was initially banned
from the University's Ann Arbor
campus in September by the
University's Department of Pub-
lic Safety. DPS altered the order
on Nov. 5, allowing Shirvell on
University property, but dictat-
ing that he can't be in the vicin-
ity of Armstrong.

Hieftje said he isn't con-
cerned about the local economy,
but more about people losing
their jobs as a result of the pos-
sible move. He estimated that
Borders has already gone from
about 1,000 to 550 employees in
the area.
"Economically, this is some-
thing we'll handle," Hieftje
said. "It won't really affect
property taxes to any great
degree."
He added that he thinks los-
ing the Borders store on East
Liberty Street would have a
slightly greater impact on the
city's economy. However, the
company hasn't mentioned any
possible closing of the location.
"The Borders store is kind
of an anchor, and we would
like to see it stay there," Hief-
tje said, adding that if Borders
does decide to close its East
Liberty location, another com-
pany would most likely move
in promptly since it is a "prime
space."

Give college athletes their cut

A delayed reaction
DPS alerts must reach students more quickly
University employee walking through the Chemistry Build-
ing on early Monday morning reported that she saw a man
pointing a gun at her. She walked away and returned a few
minutes later, and the man was gone. Whenever an incident occurs
on campus that involves a potentially armed person, the Univer-
sity's Department of Public Safety has a responsibility to imme-
diately inform students of the situation using the emergency alert
system. Some students instantly received text messages or phone
calls from DPS, but many students weren't informed of the event
until the next day. DPS needs to ensure that there is a unified emer-
gency response to all students when a dangerous situation occurs.

According to an April 4 Daily article, DPS
spokeswoman Diane Brown chose not to send
a crime alert via e-mail because police were
nearing an "all clear" of the situation. How-
ever, at 1 a.m. on Monday, an emergency alert
was sent via text message. Another text mes-
sage alert was sent at 1:25 a.m. that informed
recipients the situation was "all clear." Stu-
dents who had previously signed up for the
text messaging service were alerted of the
potential danger, but students who were not
had no idea. A mass e-mail was finally sent at
10:30 a.m. on Monday that notified all students
of the recent events.
It's troubling that only some students were
informed of a dangerous situation as it was
occurring while others received a notification
more than nine hours later. All students should
have been informedimmediately. Whenever a
gun may be involved, regardless of the sever-
ity of the situation, DPS should inform every
University student.
Brown should not have choseto hold off on
informing the studentbody of the alleged gun-
man until the next morning. Even if the emer-
gency was contained and the situation was
nearing an "all clear," students have a right
to know when a dangerous event is occurring
on campus. Since the reported gunman was

never found, it was a very real possibility that
he was still somewhere on campus after the
"all clear" was given.
Brown said in the article that police "didn't
have solid enough information at midnight to
warrant activating the emergency alert," pri-
marily because the witness of the crime wasn't
certain if the gun was real. Whether or not the
employee saw an actual gun, DPS should have
sent aprecautionary alertto all students. Their
intent to not cause a panic is understandable,
but an alert that makes students aware of the
scenario and notes that it is not an emergency
situation would have been prudent.
It's not uncommon for students to walk
around campus at midnight - the time when
the incident occurred. Students need to know
about situations like this in order to take extra
precautions and be extremely aware of their
surroundings. Regardless of how well DPS felt
the situation was contained, it had a responsi-
bility to inform the student body of the poten-
tially serious situation.
Students always need to be aware of their
surroundings late at night, and even more so
if there is a possible crime. Fortunately, no one
was hurt as a result of Monday's incident, but
DPS's failure to properly alert the entire stu-
dent body was disappointing.

Senior year of high school: A
man approaches me with a
letter in hand. Greedily, I
snatch it and rip
apart the enve-
lope. "Congrat-
ulations! The
University of
Michigan foot-
ball program has
decided to offer
you an athletic
scholarship to JOE
play..." My rac- SUGIYAMA
ing heart stops
before I reach
the end of the letter, and I collapse
on the tile floor of my high school
cafeteria.
Lucky for me, this situation didn't
exactly pan out -= as I'm sure it didn't
for thousands of other five-foot-
eight offensive linemen - and my
life didn't end as a result of receiving
a full ride to play football at the Uni-
versity. Phew - really dodged a bul-
let there. But every day, high school
athletes are given the opportunity
to go to school for free and play the
sport they love as amateurs.
Recently though, these scholar-
ships have come under fire by former
players and experts who feel their
service to their university is worth
more than a free education. In the
HBO series Real Sports with Bryant
Gumbel, an exposd examined exactly
what the college players of revenue
sports - football and basketball -
are truly worth to universities well
as how they should be compensated.
The NFL and NBA pay their play-
ers 57 percent of the leagues' total
earnings. This percentage seems
representative of their worth to each
institution - after all, the players
are the ones who fill the seats and
sell the gear. The earnings of col-
lege football and basketball players
are a bit more modest. They're paid
through education and exposure to
the next level of competition. But
again, the players create revenue.
So why aren't they getting their cut?

Enter the non-profit college sports
that make up the vast majority of
college athletics.
Instead of the $275,000 a year
that each Michigan football player
would be making - according to
the precedent set by the NFL - the
players receive a scholarship worth
between $25,000 and $50,000. This
is 9 to 18 percent of the optimal
$275,000. Though this discrepancy
is extreme, looking strictly at the
numbers undervalues the education
that is beingreceived.
One of the panel discussion mem-
bers for Real Sports was former
Michigan football coach Rich Rodri-
guez. Rodriguez suggested that the
value of a scholarship is not fully
realized because of the economic
backgrounds that many of the play-
ers come from. Education may not
be a point of emphasis in the fami-
lies of the athlete, which may cause
him to fall into the mindset that the
purpose of his scholarship isn't to
learn, but to play football.
This misguided point of view
could and should be remedied
through - wait for it - education.
Nearly all my classes in the civil
engineering department start with
presentations that highlight every-
thing that can be accomplished with
the education received at the Uni-
versity. Talk of suspension bridges
and super structures is enough to get
any civil engineer's blood pumping
and offers insight to how education
is the path to professional great-
ness. This same idea could easily be
translated for the athletes who view
course load as an inconvenience
rather than a privilege. By educating
student-athletes about what they
can achieve with their minds, the
term student-athlete becomes much
more significant.
Even with the scholarships that
are awarded to football players, it
still seems unfair for a group of 85
individuals to make millions of dol-
lars for an institution and not be
somehow compensated for their

contribution. Another suggestion
by Rodriguez was to give student-
athletes money for their living
expenses. Student-athletes are
often bogged down by their sport
and don't have time to get a job to
pay for things like travel to games.
Playing a sport is a full-time job,
minus the paycheck.
Paying players
an hourly rate
is appropriate.
The NCAA should look at their
athletes more as members of a work-
study program, instead of slaves
of an unpaid internship. Paying
student-athletes on an hourly basis
- at a reasonable rate - would be
appropriate compensation for their
service to a university. It would also
silence the critics who wish for col-
lege athletics to remain amateur
sports if these "jobs" were compen-
sated at the same level as someone
who works at the UGLi.
Student-athletes carry a burden
that I don't pretend to understand.
The added pressure of needing
to win for their school in order to
generate revenue places a massive
amount of stress on the teams and
players. Though paying football
players a percentage of total reve-
nue similar to what NFL players get
would be foolhardy, a little compen-
sation for this burden isn't too much
to ask for.
This compensation, combined
with the scholarship student-ath-
letes are already receiving, could
silence the college sports purists, as
well as reduce the degree of exploi-
tationthat many athletes feelthey're
subject to.

Takedisabilities survey

FAHAD MUHAMMAD SAJID I
The politics of scapegoating

Do you have a disability? Do you have a
friend who does? We are looking for students
with chronic or mental health conditions,
visible, invisible, auditory, visual or learning
disabilities, or something totally different, to
take our survey. Here's why:
For the past several months, a group of pas-
sionate student activists have been designing
a study to document the experiences and per-
spectives of students with disabilities. Our goal
is to not only better understand how students
with disabilities navigate University life, but
to advocate for changes that will create a more
accessible, equitable and welcoming campus
community. We are appealing to all students
with disabilities. Spend a few minutes taking
our survey - share your story and together we
can work to make the University a better place
for students with disabilities.
Our motivation has been guided primarily
by the absence of data describing this signifi-
cant demographic of students - those with
disabilities. The University knows how many
students are registered with the Services
for Students with Disabilities - more than
1,400 - but it does not necessarily know or
understand what their challenges and con-
cerns are. Are students satisfied with the
accommodations provided by the University?
Is there a climate of tolerance and inclusion
for people of different ability identities? Can
students with disabilities easily navigate the
University bureaucracy and access essential
resources? Do students with disabilities feel
comfortable "outing"' themselves to profes-
sors and GSIs? How many students hide their
disabilities for fear of stigma? These are just
some of the questions we were asking, to
which we could not find any clear answers.
Through informal conversations and for-

mal focus groups, we have begun to under-
stand that while students with disabilities
have unique and valid concerns, they aren't
being asked for their feedback. And many
students with sincere grievances have a dif-
ficult time finding suitable recourse. We
hope to change that. Our team, the Disability
Affairs Commission of the Michigan Student
Assembly, has created a survey to provide an
outlet for students with disabilities to express
their satisfaction, dissatisfaction or ambiva-
lence. We hope to capture in our survey the
ways in which the University is serving stu-
dents with disabilities, as well as the ways it
is failing them. But we know that in order to
approach representatives of the University
with any findings that describe what students
with disabilities are thinking and feeling, we
need to have a sufficient sample size. Put dif-
ferently, in order to make an impact, in order
to advocate for change, we need to show the
University that students with disabilities
demand to have their voices heard.
Which is why we are appealing to you.
Whether you openly identify as having a dis-
ability or keep it to yourself, whether you are
registered with SSD or not, whether you are
satisfied with your experience or think things
can be improved around campus, we hope
that you will take a few minutes to complete
our survey. With your anonymous responses,
we will have the data necessary to identify
and advocate for the specific changes that
will most benefit students with disabilities.

On April 16, 2007, in what turned out to be one of the
deadliest shooting incidents by a lone gunman in the his-
tory of the United States, Korean-born Seung-Hui Cho
killed 32 people and wounded many others on the Vir-
ginia Tech campus, taking his own life at the end of the
rampage. When The Washington Post followed up with
Cho's family after the incident, it was discovered that,
fearing reprisals, they had gone into hiding, with an FBI
agent and a lawyer serving as their only contact to the
outside world. At the same-time, some Korean-American
religious leaders called on their communities to partici-
pate in a 32-day fast to repent for each death.
But why should the onus of denouncing Cho's actions
fall on the Korean-American community? In U.S. law
there is no place for guilt by association, so the only per-
son answerable for the acts of terror at Virginia Tech
was Cho. Not his family. Not his community. Indeed,
many Korean-Americans criticized the fasting proposal,
arguing that it drew undue and irrelevant attention to
the killer's ethnicity. And they were absolutely right.
On March 10, 2011, Congressman Peter King (R-NY)
launched the first of a series of hearings called "The
Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim
Community and that Community's Response." Aptly
described as a new McCarthyism and a modern day
witch-hunt, King's hearings, hiding behind the fagade
of national security, are aimed at making two misguided
points: radicalization and violence are exclusively the
domain of Muslims, and the entire Muslim community
must bear the cross for the sins of a few truly rotten
apples. And on both counts, he is dead wrong.
Is it expected of Christians to publicly defend their
moral uprightness every time a child molestation case
involving a priest comes forward? Is it expected of Jews
to distance themselves from the extremists whenever a
Baruch Goldstein, who in a suicide mission in 1994 killed
29 praying Muslims and wounded 125 in Hebron, decides
to forcefully reclaim parts of the Promised Land? The
answer is an obvious and emphatic "no." You stand trial
for your crimes and your crimes alone, and that is abasic
and inviolable tenet of the law.
The fact is, propensity to violence will continue to
exist wherever there is an "us" and a "them." It cuts
across identities of any and every sort and doesn't belong
exclusively to the realm of religion. From the secular-
Hindu Leninist-Marxist Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, who
have committed more attacks than Hamas or Hezbollah,

to Adolf Hitler, who, driven by nationalism and a sense
of racial superiority, launched a war that would result in
the deaths of at least 60 million people around the world,
to former President Harry Truman and his decision to
drop atomic bombs on Japanese cities only to signal
America's post-WWII primacy to the USSR, the causes
of violence abound and share no affinity with any one
reason or group.
Evil has no identity and is certainly not confined to
any conceivable category. Moreover, every religious
community has its idiots. There are those who will
point to the Qur'an and argue that because the terrorists
involved in whatever case said they were following the
book, that's exactly what the book must say, and that all
other Muslims must also believe in their twisted logic.
Yet, the Ku Klux Klan, the largest and most vicious ter-
rorist group in the history of the U.S., whose members
lynched African Americans over an extended period of
time, maintained that it was following the Bible. But
does the KKK really represent Christianity? And must
Christians apologize for its actions?
So just as Anthony Hopkins, the Alabama preacher
who killed his wife and stuffed her body in a freezer
when she found him molesting a girl, does not repre-
sent Christianity or Christians, and just as the Kach and
Kahane Chai, the Jewish terrorist groups who want to
see Arabs expelled and religious law imposed in Israel,
do not represent Judaism or Jews, Major Nidal Hasan,
who killed 13 and wounded 30 at the Fort Hood military
base, does not speak for Islam and does not represent
Muslims. He stood trial for his crimes and his alone, and
no American-Muslim should feel the need to account or
apologize for them.
Congressman King's hearings point to dishonesty of
the highest order and conjecture of a dangerous kind.
By insinuating that violence starts and stops with Mus-
lims (when accordingto the FBI, 94 percent of terrorist
attacks on U.S. soil were committed by non-Muslims
between 1980 and 2005) and that even the law-abiding
ones must somehow be held responsible, he is destroy-
ing the very fabric of this society and tearing to pieces
the values that make this country great. These hear-
ings are not only reprehensible and counter-produc-
tive but also truly un-American, and must immediately
be discontinued.

Dueling Columns: Will Michigan or

MICHIGAN WILL PULL OFF THE UPSET

NORTH DAKOTA WILL BE TOO MUCH FOR BLUE

ST. PAUL, Minn. -
Don't call it David against
Goliath. David wasn't
5-foot-7.
It's Shawn Hunwick versus
the most potent offense in the
nation.
North Dakota's top two lines
have combined for 121 goals
- Michigan's entire roster
that skated at the NCAA West
Regional in St. Louis has 121
goals.
Sure, the
Wolverines
have their
backs against

they have a

defense and STEPHEN J.
one of the NESBITT
hottest goal-
tenders in the
nation. Since
losing twice to Miami (Ohio) in
early February, Michigan has
gone 11-1, allowing just two goals
per game.
There's a reason Michigan is
one of the four teams remain-
ing. The regular-season CCHA
champion didn't survive on just
its offense - it rode its horses on
the blue line.
And one of those horses,

Ion, will likely return this week-

of hockey. Michigan coach Red
Berenson will make a decision

faced then-No. ESPN2
2 Boston Col-
lege in the first
game of the 2007 season. Mici-
gan defeated the Eagles 4-3 in
overtime, but the story of that
game lies in how.
Then-freshmen Carl Hagelin
and Louie Caporusso started
and finished the game on a bang
for the Wolverines. Hagelin
scored the first goal of his Mich-
igan career at Xcel during the
first period to put the Wolver-
ines up early. And his linemate,
Caporusso, scored the overtime
game-winner for Michigan.
The Wolverines know they
can't live in the past, but Hage-
lin, Caporusso and the current
Michigan seniors who started

their collegiate careers in St.
Paul won't deny the history they
have in this building.
"I wasn't feeling it as much
until I got here," Caporusso said.
"When I was walking in the
rink, I felt like it was freshman
year all over again, like when I
just started here. I think it was
the same exact walk to the dress-
ing room, I think it was the same
exact dressing room. It's kind of
cool how we've made a full circle
here. Hopefully this time we can
win both games."
Hagelin and Caporusso will
take the ice again as linemates
against North Dakota tonight,
but this time around, Michigan
comes in to the NCAA Frozen
Four as an underdog to the No. 1
team in the country.
The Fighting Sioux (21-6-1
WCHA, 32-8-3 overall) demol-
ished their NCAA regional and
regional final opponents, out-
scoring Rensselaer Polytech-
nic Institute, 6-0, and Denver,
6-1, last weekend in Green Bay,
Wisc. North Dakota was the No.
2 team overall heading into the
NCAA Tournament, and is the
only remaining No. 1 seed in the
field.
But while North Dakota
poured on the goals in Green
Bay, the Wolverines had to win
two close games in St. Louis, one
against Nebraska-Omaha and
another against Colorado Col-
lege.

Michigan beat the Mavericks
after coming back from a two-
goal deficit. Sophomore forward
Kevin Lynch scored the game-
winner in overtime, after the
referees overturned an initial
no-goal call to end the game.
Against the Tigers, the Wolver-
ines got out to an early lead but
had to tighten up their defense
in the third period when Colo-
rado College cut the lead in half.
"You're going to face adver-
sity," senior defenseman Chad
Langlais said. "You have to be
able to come back, you have to be
able to play those tight games.
That's what the playoffs are all
about. North Dakota, they've
walked all over teams. I think
it's a good thing for them, but I
think it's a great thing for us to
be able to win close games."
Michigan's tgsk defensively
will be stopping North Dakota
senior forward Matt Frattin,
who headlines an impressive
offense for the Fighting Sioux.
As a team, North Dakota has
scored 36 more goals than the
Wolverines this season. Frattin
is a Hobey Baker award finalist
and was named both WCHA and
College Hockey News Player of
the Year.
While Frattin has netted 36
goals during his senior cam-
paign - cut that in half to get
Hagelin's team-leading 18 for
the Wolverines - he's had help
along the way. His linemates,

seniors Evan Trupp and Brad
Malone, have scored 17 and 16
goals, respectively. Junior Jason
Gregiore has chipped in 25.
When the puck drops tonight,
defense will be the name of the
game for the Wolverines.
"We need to play our game,
and if we let (North Dakota)
do what they are good at, they
will do it," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "We need to stay
on the ice, be responsible with
the puck, and be ultra-responsi-
ble without the puck. If you give
this team out-numbered rushes
and power plays, they will take
you right out of the game."
Michigan knows that despite
being No. 2 in the country, it is
the underdog in this matchup.
But just as no one expected the
freshmen to make waves against
Boston College three years ago,
Caporusso and Hagelin are
happy to embrace the under-
dog role against the top-ranked
Fighting Sioux.
"On paper, they're the bet-
ter team," Caporusso said. "But
I'm not sitting here telling you
that we can't beat North Dakota.
I definitely think we can beat
North Dakota. But they're going
to be a tough match. They're the
favorite coming into this tourna-
ment and they're the best team
in this tournament. But that
doesn't mean I don't think our
team is capable of doing it. We
have a lot of confidence."

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
As Michigan and North Dako-
ta prepare for Thursday's match-
up in St. Paul, here are the keys
to victory for both teams.
For North Dakota:
1. Get after Michigan net-
minder Shawn Hunwick early
and often
After outscoring Rensse-
laer Polytechnic Institute and
Denver 12-1 last weekend in the
NCAA Midwest regional and
regional final, North Dakota will
need to continue its offensive
outburst in St. Paul. The Fighting
Sioux are second in the nation in
team offense and are led by red-
hot scorers Matt Frattin and
Jason Gregiore, currently the
second and ninth-leading goal
scorers in the country with 36
and 25 goals, respectively.
Frattin and linemates Evan
Trupp and Brad Malone have
scored 69 goals this season and
registered 11 points just last
weekend. Hunwick has been
a solid netminder for the Wol-
verines all season but let three
goals slip by last weekend - two
against Nebraska-Omaha and
one against Colorado College'J
The senior has never played in
a Frozen Four, and the Fighting
Sioux should try to rattle him
early.
2. Keep a one-game focus
Everyone at the Frozen Four
can't stop talking about the
impressive numbers that the
Fighting Sioux boast. They rank
in the top-5 in the nation in goals
for, goals against, scoring mar-
gin and penalty kill, and their
power play sits in seventh.
They have six players with
more than 13 goals. Their net-
minder has 30 wins. In Wednes-
day's press conference, North
Dakota assured the media that it
is preparing for only Michigan,
but it's still hard to ignore the
buzz surroundingthis team. The
Fighting Sioux have brought a
business-trip attitude to St. Paul,
but they need to make sure that
they're not overlooking their
Thursday night date in favor of
the national title game.
3. Listen to coach Dave Hak-
stol
Whatever Hakstol is doing
behind the scenes and on the
bench is working well for North
Dakota. In his seventh season
at the helm, Hakstol has led the
program to five Frozen Four
appearances and has helped
North Dakota reach the NCAA
Tournament all seven seasons.
He has led the team to three

WCHA Final Five champion-
ship titles during his reign and
has one WCHA Coach of the
Year title. Hakstol has the North
Dakota program on the fast track
to being national title contend-
ers each season in an extremely
competitive conference. What-
ever his game plan for Michigan
is, it's bound tobe a good one.
For Michigan:
1. Ride whoever's got the hot
shot
As senior forward Louie Capo-
russo said Wednesday, "This
isn't a top-heavy type of team."
The Wolverines have received
production from a variety of
players this season and need to
continue to score-by-committee
to have a shot at cracking North
Dakota, which boasts the No. 3
defense in the country.
While senior forward Carl
Hagelin leads the team with 18
goals, Michigan needs to find
ways to get the puck to who-
ever's got some luck in St. Paul.
Whether it's a seeing-eye shot
from the blue line from sopho-
more defenseman Lee Moffie or
a toe-drag one-timer by senior
forward Scooter Vaughan. the
Wolverines need to utilize their
balance on all four lines to wear
down the Fighting Sioux.
2. Stay out of the penalty box
Last weekend in St. Louis,
Michigan gave opponents 13
power play opportunities.
While the Wolverines' penalties
allowed only one power play goal
allweekend,it doesn't changethe
fact that the more 5-on-5 hockey
Michigan plays on Thursday, the
better off it will be. Aside from
fatiguing critical players on the
penalty kill, spending too many
minutes in the sin bin against a
North Dakota power play (that
converts at 23 percent) won't
give Hunwick much support.
3. Feed off the seniors
Michigan's current senior
class ,started its postseason
careers as freshmen with a 4-3
overtime win against No. 2 Bos-
ton College at the Xcel Energy
Center. And while the class that
they started with has dwindled
from 12 to seven, they're going to
be ultra-amped up for this game.
As freshmen, the same class
made it to the Frozen Four,
and fell one game short of the
national championship game
after losing to Notre Dame, 5-4,
in overtime.
The current seniors are the
backbone of this team, and the
rest of the Wolverines will need
to grab some of their intensity if
they want to advance to Satur-
day's national title game.

Rust brothers look forward to potential National
Championship matchup, capping off emotional year

By STEPHENJ. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
ST. PAUL, Minn. - Matt Rust
and his little brother Bryan have
fought over plenty of things dur-
ing the past 18 years. But none of
them, it's safe to say, have been as
big as a national championship.
And they're just a step away
from meeting once again.
The anticipation started just
after the Michigan hockey team
punched its ticket to the Frozen
Four with a 2-1 victory over Col-
orado College.
"As soon as I found out they
won, I sent him a fast text, 'Hope
I'll see you in St. Paul,' "said
Bryan, a freshman forward for
Notre Dame.
The followingnight, the Fight-
ing Irish finished off New Hamp-
shire to capture the Northeast
Regional.
"Matt wrote back, 'Congrats,
you'll get your chance in a few
weeks, bro.'"
Both teams have a game to
win in St. Paul before the Rusts
can meet again, but Matt and
Bryan know just what this week
means to their family. The boys
are eyeing the championship
game as the perfect way to com-
plete a roller-coaster season, on
and off the ice.

Plus, it sounds like he also has
a little unfinished business with
his brother.
"I saw (Bryan) during the pre-

Senior golfer Lion Kim played with Bubba Watson and Aaron Baddeley in the par-three contest on Wednesday.
Ki-m enjoys par-3 contest
with Watson and Baddeley

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
AUGUSTA, Ga. - It was some-
thing you'd probably never see at
any golf course, let alone at the
No. 1-ranked course in the world.
Two-time Tour champion
Bubba Watson stood holding the
flag on the first
green during NOTEBOOK
Wednesday's
par 3 contest,
preparing to KEVIN
take a golf ball RAFTERY
to the chest
off the club of
friend Ricky At the Masters
Fowler, who
teed off 130 yards away.
"It was really funny to do it,
but then the ball came right at
me and I was like, 'Oh gosh,' "
Watson said. "But I wanted to act
like I was tough, so I just stood
there."
Luckily for Watson, the ball
landed in front of him and settled
about four feet from the hole.
And to his credit, he didn't even
flinch.
The crowd laughed and
applauded as Watson scampered
back over to the second tee, smil-
ing and waving to the fans.
"Me and Ricky are really good
friends," he said. "It was just
something fun for us to do."
Such was the mood at the
Augusta National Par 3 course on
Wednesday afternoon.
During the nine-hole round,
players stopped to give auto-
graphs, talk with fans and just
have a good time.
Three-time PGA Tour Cham-
pion Aaron Baddeley had his fam-
ily alongside him for the round.
His wife, Richelle, and their two
daughters - both under the age
of three - caddied for him.
"That was awesome," Bad-

deley said. "(My two year old
daugher) Jewell loved it. She did
good. She made a putt on the last
hole."
For Michigan senior Lion
Kim, who played with Watson
and Baddeley, it was the perfect
chance to get used to the enor-
mous Augusta crowds - thou-
sands of people hovered around
each green and tee box on
Wednesday - in a competitive,
yet relaxed, atmosphere.
"Bubba and Aaron were great
sports, and we had a lot of fun,"
Kim said. "We were just staying
loose and not taking it too seri-
ously.
"I wasn't nervous because in
my mind; (the crowd) came to
watch Bubba and Aaron. I maybe
had 20 percent of the. crowd
cheering for me, so it was fun."
Kim finished the ' contest at
1-over, notching two bogeys
and a birdie. He missed just one
green but couldn't quite get the
mid-range putts to fall.
But for Kim, as it was for all
the players on Wednesday, his
score wasn't a concern.
"I hit the ball great," he said.
"My instructor (Brian Mogg) just
complimented me that I probably
had the best distance control out
of anyone in our group. So that
was great.".
And heading into tomorrow's
first round, Kim will look to play
with confidence and continue to
take in all The Masters has to
offer.
"Every moment here is memo-
rable to me," Kim said. "Every
second, every minute is memo-
rable."
SECOND HOLE SHUFFLE: On
the second tee in the par three
contest, caddie Louis Lawrence
started taking off his clothes.
But don't panic - he had two
layers on, and he didn't do any-

thing to get himself kicked out of
Augusta National. One of the lay-
ers was his caddie uniform, and
the other wes his normal golf
clothes.
Lawrence was taking off his
uniform in order to give it to
Michigan assistant coach Chris
Whitten, acting as Kim's honor-
ary caddie for the contest.
"Louis popped out of his
jumpsuit Superman style," Whit-
ten said. "I threw it on, and next
thing I knew, I was taking the pin
out for Bubba Watson and Aaron
Baddeley. It was unbelievable."
But Whitten, a Rockford, Mich.
native, wasn't originally plan-
ning on caddying. Kim's brother
was scheduled . to perform the
duty, but he told Kim right before
the round he couldn't do it.
The fifth-year assistant coach
couldn't say no to the opportu-
nity --literally.
"As we were walking along
(the first hole), Brian Mogg
grabbed me and asked me if I
wanted to caddy," Whitten said.
"I must have looked like a deer
in headlights because a second
later he was like, 'Just say yes.'
"I really just tried to stay out
of the way and get Lion what-
ever he needed. It went by really
fast, but I'll never forget that."
MASTERING THE LEARNING
CURVE:Watson commented on
Kim's game, saying that he had
both a good swing and putting
stroke.
He mentioned, though, that
Kim has some learning to do -
as does everyone in the tourna-
ment.
"He's a very good kid," Wat-
son said. "He's young, you know,
he's got to learn the game. But
we all gotta learn the game.
We're still learning. It looked
like he had a good head on his
shoulders."

AUGUSTA, Ga. -
s I walked up to the fifth
hole of the par 3 contest
n Wednesday, I heard a
whisper from a nearby fan.
"Who is
that guy?"
the fan asked
as Michi-
gan senior
Lion Kim
approached
from the
fourth h KEVIN
green. The RAFTERY
fan's friend
shrugged his
shoulders
and took a sip of beer.
"No idea," he responded.
But then the man noticed
Kim's Michigan hat and shirt.
"Oh, he must be a Michigan
man," the fan said.
It was a small moment that
probably didn't mean much
to the two fans, but it was a
moment that spoke volumes to
what Kim has already accom-
plished - before the bright
lights of the tournament even
turn on.
Kim has given every Michi-
gan graduate, every Michigan
fan and anyone who has ever
been associated with the Uni-
versity a reason to be proud.
Throughout the week, he has
conducted himself in a way
that would bring any mother
to tears.
In fact, I hope my mom
hasn't been watching for a
couple reasons. One, because
she cries a lot. And two, if she
compared Kim to me, she may
want to adopt him and send me

packing.
Any time someone has asked
Kim for an autograph, he has.
at least acknowledged the
request, even if he didn't have
the time or permission to sign
it.
As he walked up to the first
tee for Wednesday's par 3 con-
test, a young fan asked him for
his signature.
Kim looked the boy in the
eye and apologized: "I'm sorry,
I have to go tee off."
I'd say that's a pretty valid
excuse as Bubba Watson and
Aaron Baddeley were standing
on the tee, waiting for Kim to
He's been more than will-
ing to give an interview to
any media member, and he's
treated me like he's known me
for years, always greeting me
by name.
When the par 3 contest
ended, fans swarmed Kim,
asking for pictures and auto-
graphs.
Many media members would
have tried to jump in there and
get an interview when they
knew they had a chance to talk
with the player before he drove
off and left for the day.
Instead, I waited - I knew
I'd get my chance. I stood at the
top of the hill behind the ninth
green, and when he emerged
out of the horde of people, I
gave him a wave. He saw me
and let me know exactly where
he was going so I could talk to
him.
Minutes later, I met him at
the range and interviewed him
and he gladly answered any

questions I had.
I realize Lion Kim isn't Tiger
Woods or Phil Mickelson. I
realize there's not as many
members of the media covering
him as there are for the other
tour players. .
But I can guarantee there
are only a select few players on
tour who have been as accom-
modating as Kim.
Woods has been nowhere to
be found for the most part - he
didn't even play in today's par 3
contest. Mickelson did show his
face today for the contest, but
other than that has been hard
to find.
Don't get me wrong, there
are good guys on tour - Wat-
son, Baddeley, KJ Choi and
Zach Johnson were all more
than willing to give an inter-
view when I asked them.
And I'm not suggesting that
Woods and Mickelson are bad
people.
But Kim realizes it's a privi-
lege to be at The Masters, and
his actions support that in
every way.
So when you turn on ESPN
or CBS to watch The Masters
this weekend and you see the
block 'M', feel proud - not just
because one of your own is
playing at Augusta, but because
the man wearing the Michigan
gear is representing the Uni-
versity in the best way possible,
on the biggest stage in golf.
Just do your best to hold
back the tears, Mom.

Masters all week. He can be

20 1 VaASTERS
ESPN's Van Pelt gives the keys to success at Augusta

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
AUGUSTA, Ga - ESPN sports-
caster and SportsCenter anchor
Scott Van Pelt now has a "go-to"
line every time somebody asks him
who he thinks
will win the ' KEVIN
2011 Masters. RAFTERY
"I get asked
that a lot by At the Masters
people on
Twitter," Van
Pelt said Wednesday. "I say, 'Okay,
Butler played UConn on Monday.
That wastwo (teams) andIgot that
wrong. Now I got 99 guys, and you
want me to tell you who's going to
win?' I mean, a golf tournament is
such a crap shoot."
Van Pelt may have been clue-

less about who's going to win, but
he was very confident about who
was not going to win - any six of
the amateurs in the field, which
includes Michigan senior Lion
Kim.
"The stage is too big, and the
knowledge that is required is too
lengthy," Van Pelt said. "It would
be as remarkable as anything
we've seen if an amateur could
win"
He did say, however, that he
wouldn't be too surprised to see an
amateur make it to this weekend if
somebody gets hot. Van Pelt, who
has covered the Masters for ESPN
for several years, also mentioned
what he thinks it's going to take to
see success at Augusta this year.
"I think,ultimately, it's patience,
the understanding of when it's

time to go," he said. "It's under- could bode well for Kim, whose
standing when the light is red and short game has impressed many
when the light is green." already this week, and he will no
In other words, it's knowing doubt need it at times in order to

"The thing about this course is,

weekend
essentials
Apr. 7 to 10
)
ON STAGE
Double your fun this
weekend with per-
formances by two of
the greatest string
quartets. Tomorrow,
the Takscs Quartet
will team up with pia-
nist Jeffrey Kahane at
Rackham Auditorium.
Saturday, acclaimed
violinist Christian Tet-
zlaff, his sister Tanja
and two other mem-
bers of the Tetzlaff
Quartet will take the
stage. Tickets from $24
and $20, respectively.

At a university with
more than 26,000
students and hun-
dreds of disciplines,
an innovative thesis idea can be a
hard thing to come by. Yet, every
year students in varied depart-
ments and colleges stumble upon
original creations for their senior
honors theses. The subjects range
anywhere from dramatic plays to
short films to ... human hair.
The main installation piece
for Art & Design senior Autumn
Fawn Hernandez's thesis, called
"Aquhairium," will be a set of
glass cylinders, each of which are
two feet tall and four inches in
diameter.
Hernandez plans to suspend
the cylinders from the ceiling in
a dark space, filling them with
water and different kinds of hair.
The cylinders will be lit up and an
air pump will blow bubbles into
them.
"Depending on the kind of hair
that's in it - if it's really coarse or
fine or oily or dyed - air collects
to the hair differently and will
get trapped in it or escape," she
explained. "When they're lit up,
it puts focus on the hair and you
can just see all these little bubbles
caught in it."
The inspiration for "Aquhair-
ium" came last year while Her-
nandez was studying abroad in
Australia. The assignment for her
three jewelry design classes there
was to create pieces out of a medi-
um other than metal.
"A 'weird' medium is what they
called it," Hernandez said. "So I
picked wax. When I was work-
ing with wax, that obviously led
to hair."
She quickly began work on
a line of pendants out of wax-
removed hair.
"The idea behind that was
to take a piece of someone with
you," she said. "I made all these
really great friends I was going
to leave in six months and never
see again, so I took hot wax and
I would wax one of my friends'

belly buttons or something with
actual wax. If you let it set long
enough and rip it off, then the
hair is just perfectly in the wax."
Hernandez then set the hair-
wax in metal to complete the pen-
dents.
Another one of Hernandez's
pieces involved cutting up the
legs of pantyhose until she had
15 feet of fabric. She stuffed the
fabric with hair from local salons
and used it as a runway piece,
draped around her body. As she
walked down the runway, hair
trickled out of the open ends of
the hosiery.
At the same time as her Austra-
lian experiments, she was receiv-
ing e-mails from her professors
about picking a topic for her
senior thesis.
"And I was all geeked up and
excited about hair," she said. "I
wanted to just continue what I
was doing."
"Aquhairium" opens April 15 at
6 p.m. in the basement of Work:
Ann Arbor on State St. In addition
to this exhibition, Hernandez has
been photographing her installa-
tion for the Douglas J Aveda salon
on Liberty St. She will be insert-
ing large-scale photographs into
the glass tables where customers
sit while they wait to get their
hair done.
Hernandez's continued dedi-
cation to the medium of hair
stems partially from the reac-
tions she got from her classmates
in Australia.
"My class was just so appalled,"
she said. "I was just this one for-
eign, American chick that was
messing around with hair, and
they were just so grossed out.
When I showed my class my
pieces, they just cringed and
didn't even want to be by it. That
response was so exciting to me."
Hernandez hopes her ongo-
ing interest in a rather eccentric
subject will come across in the
exhibition and inspire others to
rethink hair.
"Hair, water, air and light -

those four elements come togeth-
er when you're showering, when
you're swimming," she said. "And
you don't really appreciate what's
happening."
Hernandez doesn't want peo-
ple to have a specific reaction to
"Aquhairium."
"I want people to think whatev-
er they're going to think because
it's art," she said. "But I want peo-
ple to kind of just stop and appre-
ciate the beauty because there's a .
repulsion-attraction to the hair.
"It's disembodied hair," she
added. "People usually think hair
off the body is gross, you know -
you have a random hair in your
food, you don't like it. So I'm just
going to put a bunch of hair and
hang it and hope that people can
appreciate it and think about hair
differently."
In all dimensions
Screen Arts and Cultures
senior Jacob Mendel's honors the-
sis is a 20-minute short film called
"Train of Shadows," a "surrealist
film noir" that tells the story of a
man who wakes up on atrain with
amnesia and meets a hypnotist
who guides him through various
memories. The film begins with a
shot paying homage to the Lumi-
ere Brothers' 1895 silent film "The
Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Sta-
tion" - a scene that evokes what
Mendel calls the "mechanization
of time" - and then proceeds
through a nonlinear narrative,
with the audience piecing togeth-
er the story the same time the
protagonist is.
"It's all period, it's all 1920s,"
he said. "It involves many dif-
ferent locations, many different
spaces. I'm editing it now and ...
you kind of get sucked into the
diegesis."
Mendel is no stranger to inven-
tive works in the field of film. He
studied abroad in Prague during
his junior year and directed a film
called "Zlata Rybka," which is

FOOD)WARS
Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a battlefield
as Daily Arts staffers butt heads over which restaurant makes it best.

Frozen Yogurt

AMER'S
Various locations
All three Amer's locations (S. State,
Church, Union) provide the chance to ven-
ture a lick at flavors including pomegran-
ate tart, creamy caramel, juicy orange tart,
black cherry tart.and key lime tart. Amer's
also offers a wide range of fruit, all of your
normal chocolate crunchies, sprinkles and
even coconut shavings. But if you want to
cleanse your palate with water that isn't
room temperature, try elsewhere.
ROD'S
812 South State
Nobody buys the fro-yo at Rod's with-
out gettingthe stuff inside. A mountainous
mass of a dessert spooned into a slightly
ghettoized plastic cup, you can purchase
the Collider in chocolate or vanilla vari-
eties. And the add-ons: candy, fruits and
cereals galore! Cold Stone mix-ins don't
compare to this heavenly mess. April rain
showers might be crummy, but rest assured
- the Rod's Collider will alwaysbe yummy.

lab
505 East Liberty
Among the plethora of fro-yo vendors
gracing the streets of Ann Arbor, lab is
the only one yet to eschew heavy doses of
sweetener for atart yogurt that's, well, tart.
The natural flavor of lab's dairy-licious des-
sert allows the actual taro, honeydew and
plain yogurt to tingle the tastebuds instead
of the overbearing sugar that's so common
in fro-yo these days. Frozen yogurt con-
noisseurs should look no further.
YOGOBLISS
122 South University
When the temperature briefly surpassed
60 degrees this week, frozen yogurt finally
seemed like a justifiable treat. YogoBliss's
spin on this classic college treat is disap-
pointing. The only non-self serve fro-yo
establishment on campus, YogoBliss's poli-
cy works against it: You're given too few of
the toppings you want, and more than three
toppings costs you. Plus, the tart fro-yo
itself was too sour. A no-go for this fro-yo.

years after the debut of "Swan
Lake," Thomas Hardy published
the literary classic "Tess of the
d'Urbervilles," in which the sweet
and virginal Tess is taken advan-
tage of by a wealthy neighbor and
becomes shunned by her com-
munity after having his child.
Tess lives in a place where there
is no middle ground: One either
conforms to society's standards
of purity, or one becomes perma-
nently marked with sin. Unable to
reconciletwoextremes, Tess ends
up being hanged for the murder
of her neighbor. Though the plot
isn't identical to "Swan Lake," it
deals with the idea that an inabil-
ity to balance the two aspects of
femininity can end tragically.

In the end, the Pink Ladies con-

Spinning a performance
Meanwhile, Interarts senior
Yonit Olshan's thesis, "Arachne:
The Origin" premieres tomorrow
night at the Walgreen Drama Cen-
ter. Though it classifies as a play,
"Arachne" includes live music,
dance and puppetry, making it a
truly inter-artistic experience.
"I was really trying to think
about what I wanted to say about
myself as an artisan, as a perfor-
mance artist," Olshan said.
The play brings to life the story
of Arachne and her feud with the
goddess Athena over who is the
best weaver in the world. Olshan
sees it both as a play about an art-
ist, fighting for her craft and try-
ing to break tradition, and as an
origin myth: the creation of the
spider as a result of Arachne's
eventual transformation.
"Athena doesn't really have a
lot of faith in mortals," Olshan
said. "But the truth is that mor-
tals have a lot of beauty in their
uniqueness."
Olshanhas had this show inher
head for more than a year.
"To finally see what other peo-
ple can bring to it is so much more
beyond what I could ever have
imagined it to be," she said. "It's
so exciting."
Olshan's involvement in the
play was inspired by her interest
in different artistic backgrounds,
as well as the idea of cross-cultur-
al origin myths. She researched
myths and performance tech-
niques of different cultures to cre-
ate the play.
"The beauty behind it is that all
of these different creation myths,
even though they're so different,"
she said, "they really all hit on
very similar things like love, orjoy
- all these purposes in life."
Though her primary back-
ground is costume design, Olshan
was drawnto creatingthings with
groups rather than on her own. As
a result, she transferred to Inter-
arts, a major newly rendered by
the University that combines pro-
grams from the School of Art &
Design and School of Music, The-

atre & Dance to give the students
involved a truly holistic view on
performance arts.
"That sort of sense that it actu-
ally is an Interarts performance
is one of the main inspirations for

do and a black leather jumpsuit
instead of a tutu.
In 1989, the creators of Disney's
"The Little Mermaid" stole a page
from the "Swan Lake" book when
they had Ursula attempt to stop
Ariel's marriage to Prince Eric by
arriving at the castle in the form
of a black-haired bombshell with
Ariel's beautiful voice. Again: two
beautiful girls, physically iden-
tical except for their hair color
- one a young, impressionable
princess and the other an evil,
seductive sorceress. This part of
the plotline practically screams
"Swan Lake." Of course, since it's
a Disney movie, Ariel eventually
triumphs and finds love with her
Prince Charming.
Whether nice girls really finish
last is an issue that is still up for
debate and has been in the fore-
front of societal consciousness for
a long time. One thing's for sure:
Going to see "Swan Lake" and
having the feminine dichotomy
represented with gorgeous scen-
ery, tutus and a storybook plotline
is a much more enjoyable way to
ponder the dilemma than reading
an academic analysis of it.
the piece itself," she said. "The
collaboration and the meaning
behind performance art is still a
new sort of emerging art form."
As an Interarts collaboration,
"Arachne" has received assis-
tance from a host of different
studies, from a director from the
Department of Theatre & Drama
to a composer from the School of
Music to a choreographer from
the Dance Department.
"It's really cool right now, in
tech week," Olshan said. "It's one
of the first times we're seeing a
lot of it come together. We put the
cello recording with the dance
choreography for the first time
and it's just goes so well. It's excit-
ing and nerve-wracking, but they
really do just make each other so
much better."
For Olshan, directing a collabo-
ration introduced her to a whole
new world of creative potential.
"Typically, I'm the costume
designer," she said. "I'm not used
to being the person who gets to
make the final decision. We just
go by what the director wants, but
right now I'm playing that role ...
I've learned how to trust myself
to be the leader amongst all these
other amazingly talented artistic
people."
The opportunity to bring danc-
ers, musicians and actors togeth-
er in such a way was a learning
opportunity in and of itself.
Olshan said it, was inspiring to
work with other people to bring
out their best.
"It's about all of these artis-
tic things, but it's really about
Arachne," she said. "It's about her
wanting to fight to be creative,
which I think is what we're all
doing. We're fighting for our indi-
viduality and we're fighting to be
unique against society."
She hopes the audience takes
away the importance of Arachne
standing up for who she is and
trying to accomplish a feat that
others thought tobe impossible.
"It's ahope,"she added, echoing
the sentiments of fellow aspiring
artists. "It's ahope and an inspira-
tion to be unique and creative and
be who you are. It sounds really
cheesy, but it's beautiful."

opened it

The fading paint of the res-
taurant's teal and cream facade,
with a sign advertising gyros,
fine Greek foods and cocktails,
indicates that any aspirations of
grandeur are long gone. There's
nothing shiny or new about this
place.
The reasons I chose the Par-
thenon as the location of my last
food column are twofold. First,
I'd never been there before and I
was curious. Second, I was han-
kering for some good Greek food.
While Detroit has it in spades
in Greektown, Ann Arbor is
lacking in places to get a good
saganaki, the ever-popular
Greek flamingcheese dish. So
I dragged Sharon, the fearless
leader of The Michigan Daily's
Arts section, downtown for
lunch on Friday in search of a
last hurrah.
Everything inside was deco-
rated in muted blues and creamy
whites. Walking by a barrier
made of stacked glass bricks,
our waiter seated us at one of
the five or so booths lining a
wall with windows. We passed
pictures of famous Greek archi-
tecture and plaster reproduc-

tions of vases. Above our table
and the other booths hung a
snaking fake grapevine. This all
could've been cheesy, but it was
actually quite cute and cozy. In
the back, a large family enjoyed
a lively lunch. We made our way
through the menus slowly. The
waiter didn't pressure us.
Finally we decided on the
saganaki made from kasseri
cheese. The waiteryelled "Opa!"
and lit the plate dramatically.
Flames flew high above us -
purple, then blue, then finally
orange. It was the best and most
theatrical part of our meal,
hands down. In the flambeed
crust, flavors danced together
elegantly. The taste was sour
and subtle all at once. The dish
came with a basket of ambigu-
ous white bread that we barely
touched. The bread is unneces-
sary - this cheese stands alone.
No goats were
harmed in
the writing of
this column.
The menu at Parthenon is
extensive, offering an array
of Greek and Mediterranean
dishes. I'd been warned that the
portion sizes were large, but was
relieved to find they had a half-
order of their moussaka avail-
able for lunch.
The restaurant's take on
moussaka missed the mark a bit.
The bechamel sauce was splen-

Czech for "The Goldfish."
"It was avery surreal premise,"
Mendel said. "Someone's goldfish
is kidnapped and these weird cat
people are responsible. It involves
reincarnation ... you know, weird,
short surrealist film."
"Zlata Rybka" earned Men-
del an award at the International
Surrealist Film Festival, which is
organized by the surrealist film-
maker Paul Yates, and eventu-
ally led into the dream-infused
venture of "Train of Shadows." It
seems appropriate that the medi-
um should match the film's theme
of memory - the half-hour movie
was shot completely in stereo-
scopic 3-D.
"The process is using two cam-
eras simultaneously," Mendel
explained. "You get two Canon
5Ds side by side and bend them
inward ... one is going to one eye
and one is going to the other eye.
Through polarized projection,
this basically tricks your visual
cortex into perceiving depth."
Mendel quickly embraced the
technical and creative challenges
of shooting a "surreal film noir"
in 3-D.
"I'm nerdy and I'm artsy, so it's
a nice mix of the two,"he said. "To
do a shot, you basically have to do
trigonometry. You have to do the
angle in which the two cameras
are bending ... where they inter-
sect is the perceptible depth of
the screen, so everything in front
of that is popping out at you and
everything behind that is reced-
ing."
"Train of Shadows" is an
exhaustive collaboration between
more than 100 graduate and
undergraduate students, with
areas of study ranging from per-
forming arts technology to media
arts to theatre performance.
Mendel spoke about the his-
tory and challenges of shooting in
three dimensions.
"The thing about 3-D is that it's
actually very old," he explained.
"The technology of stereoscopy
was invented before cinema ...
Every now and then, it's rediscov-
ered and there's a lot of hype and
then it kind of fades away."
Added Mendel: "There's not
really 3-D film schools, so you

have to teach yourself a lot."
The film may be a project for
the University, but it is also an
integral part of Mendel's future
beyond graduation. He and a
friend plan to start a Michigan-
based 3-D film company in the
fall, called Giant Eel Productions,
through which they hope to push
the boundaries of 3-D cinema.
"What would a 3-D Western
look like? Why isn't there a 3-D
documentary?" Mendel asked.
"Now that indie 3-D is possible ...
you can use digital video cameras
that are affordable. That's what
we're trying to do. People are
already ready to watch 3-D - we
just want to make more interest-
ing content with that medium."
Mendel is not a subscriber to
conventional 3-D as it is used in
popcorn movies.
"A lot of films now overuse that,
I think," he said. "Things flying at
you and explosions and all this
sort of stab-you-in-the-face sort of
amusement park 3-D. We're try-
ing to do something more subtle."
"Train of Shadows" premieres
tomorrow at the Michigan The-
ater as part of the TEDxUofM
conference. RealD 3D donated
free glasses to Mendel and his
associates as an incentive for stu-
dents to continue experimenting
with 3-D technology.
"I'm a cinematographer by
training," Mendel said. "I think
mostly the film will be aestheti-
callysomethingnew and different
and kind of exciting. I hope that

ships, volunteering, studying
abroad or working at their dream
job, Ann Arbor seems to close
her tired eyes in their absence,
lay down her winter-beaten body
and slip into a peaceful hiberna-
tion until the student population
returns.
But however tempting it may
be to subscribe to this vision of
the University's surrounding
town, the perception is flawed
- Ann Arbor is alert and wide
awake throughout the summer,
bursting to life with technicolor
opportunities in which students
can immerse themselves. Stu-
dents who spend their much-
needed hiatus in Ann Arbor have
the exclusive opportunity to cre-
ate, experience and participate
in a variety of artistic pursuits.
Shakespearean students
For students interested in let-
ting their inner thespian loose,
Shakespeare in the Arb provides
a nontraditional way to stretch
out their drama muscles. Now

in its 11th year, the program
presents Shakespeare's classics
on the informal stage of Nich-
ols Arboretum's landscape. Past
productions have used the space
to full advantage, incorporating
dramatic elements - like a ship-
wreck in the Huron River for
"The Tempest" - to, as director
and Residential College lectur-
er Kate Mendeloff said, "make
Shakespeare come alive."
Mendeloff added: "The way we
perform Shakespeare is in a very
accessible manner because you're
right there with the actors, and
you're right there in the action."
This year's production will
be "The Winter's Tale" - one of
Shakespeare's later works that
switches from tragedy to comedy
halfway through the play. Men-
deloff, who jumpstarted Shake-
speare in the Arb 11 years ago,
intends to continue her tradition
of using the setting of the arbo-
retum by incorporating a flock of
sheep and, ideally, a bear into the
show.
"Shakespeare could go over
to the bear-baiting place, which
was right next to the Globe The-
atre, and borrow the bear for 15
minutes," Mendeloff said. "But
it'll be a little harder for us."
In addition to attending this
year's show, students can apply
to be ushers (and get to see the
show for free) or audition to be
involved in performance or pro-
duction. Selected students have
the opportunity to earn credit
for participating. The Residential
College .offers a corresponding
four-credit, upper-level humani-
ties course - "Environmental
Theater Production Workshop in

the Arboretum" - which focuses
on reading the play, interpreting
it and rehearsing.
"(Students) ought to really
consider getting involved as
actors, designers, musicians,"
Mendeloff said. "It's an opportu-
nity for students to explore great
works of theater as part of their
academic experience and also as
part of their viewing experience.
"It's just a great opportunity to
celebrate the Arb and celebrate
Shakespeare," she added.
Cooljams for hot summer days
Robb Woulfe, director for the
Ann Arbor Summer Festival, says
the annual music and arts festi-
val has something for everyone.
The Ann Arbor Summer Fes-
tival includes many events at a
variety of locations on Central
Campus, including free outdoor
film screenings, DJs spinning
late into the night and Rock the
Mall, a teen band competition to
be launched this summer. How-
ever, Woulfe believes the festival
is best known for its free out-
door and ticketed indoor concert
series: Top of the Park and Main-
stage, respectively.
This year's Mainstage lineup
includes comedian Steve Martin
on banjo with The Steep Can-
yon Rangers, indie sensation
and notorious whistler Andrew
Bird and jazzy local group The
Macpodz. Mainstage perfor-
mances will also feature a host
of blues, folk and rock bands, in
addition to daredevil acrobats
from Australia. Top of the Park's
lineup of free shows will be
announced May 2.

the lovely layered feel you usu-
ally get when you fork into this
dish. Sharon had the vegetarian
version. We were both pleased,
but underwhelmed.
After two courses, we were
stuffed. But alas - we had to try
to the baklava. We ordered one
to split. The waiter delivered it
on two plates, divided without
asking. The pastry before us
was perfection. Flaky layers of
crisped phyllo dough gave way to
syrupy filling flecked with nuts
and goodness. This was fantastic
baklava. Totally worth push-
ing through the fullness we felt
before.

All and all, the experience was
pleasant. At $11 each, the meal
wasn't bad for two courses and a
dessert. I was glad I finally went
inside, having passed it many
times these last four years. The
food wasn't excellent, but we
gave it the old college try.
In the end, all the places I've
gone to during my time in Ann
Arbor deserved that "try." The
ones that are great are that way
because of the food, but also
because of my memories of them.
There is a reason some of us
know the inside of our favorite
coffee shop better than we know
the inside of our bedrooms. It's
because that's where we do our
living.
Twenty years from now, you
might look back and realize that

AN ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA:
THE TASK BEFORE Us

some of your best times took
place at Pizza House at 4 a.m.
biting into an order of cheesy
bread. Perhaps you'll remember
slurping on a cup of soup from
Le Dog, saving the sauerkraut
dripping from your Reuben at
Zingerman's or having a Col-
lider at Rod's during a rough
moment.
Waiting for breakfast at
Angelo's, sampling the beer at
Ashley's and stepping over the
threshold of Dominick's when
you were finally old enough not
to get turned away - these are
the things we will not forget.
I've spent a great deal of time
exploring the local cuisine this
place has to offer. I'm so glad I
did. It's part of the reason this
town is so special. Stay tasty,
Ann Arbor.
