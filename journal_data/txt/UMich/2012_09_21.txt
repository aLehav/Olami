Coleman also gets
3 percent raise,
donates it back to
the University
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
The University's efforts to
revamp residence halls on cam-
pus have continued with the
approval of a $60-million reno-
vation of South Quad Residence
Hall.
In addition to approving
updates to the residence hall, the
University's Board of Regents
voted to raise the salary of Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man and discussed the impact
of Coursera technology in the
classroom during its monthly
meeting Thursday afternoon.
Stephen Forrest, the University's
vice president for research, also
reported that the University's
research budget was increased
by 3 percent this year, a historic
high.
The 106,700 square-foot
renovation of South Quad will
increase the size of the dining
hall, the upgrade the restrooms,
improve study lounges and add
more of study spaces throughout
the building.
A majority of the project's
funds will be devoted to util-

ity upgrades including a new air
conditioning and heating system
and improved wired and wireless
Internet access. Timothy Slot-
tow, the University's executive
vice president and chief financial
officer, said the renovation will
involve a "total revamp" of the
first two floors.
In an interview before the
meeting, E. Royster Harper, the
University's vice president for
student affairs, said the project
would be similar to previous
renovations in other residence
halls, noting that improving the
student experience while pre-
serving the history of the build-
ing is key.
"In our heritage halls, because
some of the buildings are so icon-
ic and so beautiful, we're really
investing in them, and investing
heavy in the infrastructure,"
Harper said. "The majority of
the money has been in the infra-
structure, in the wiring, in the
HVAC systems."
According to Harper, the ren-
ovation of East Quad Residence
Hall is still on schedule and slat-
ed to re-open in time for the fall
2013 semester. However, closing
South Quad at the same time as
East Quad's reopening will result
in a net loss of 300 beds in the
University Housing system.
"We'llbein thiskind ofcrunch
for several more years," Harper
said. "We've been doing pretty

For theDaily
In the latest twist in a long
series of legal proceedings,
Bloomfield Hills, Mich. lawyer

Deborah Gordon requested a
court-ordered mental exami-

the former Michigan assistant

The federal court filing,

response to an ongoing defa-

against Gordon. In August,
Shirvell was ordered to pay
$4.5 million in damages to
Chris Armstrong, a University

McCormack
running for state
Supreme Court
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The cast of "The West Wing"
has a new policy crisis: getting
voters to fill out the nonpartisan
ballot on Election Day.

In a four-minute political
advertisement released Thurs-
day on YouTube, the show's
cast, including Martin Sheen,
Bradley Whitford, Allison
Janney and Richard Schiff,
encourages voters to fill out
the nonpartisan section of the
ballot when voting on Nov. 6.
One version of the advertise-
ment points specifically to the
Michigan Supreme Court race
and mentions Bridget Mary

McCormack, the associate dean
of clinical affairs at the Univer-
sity Law School and a candidate
for the Supreme Court.
The advertisement was,
in part, due to the initiative
of McCormack's sister, Mary
McCormack, an actress who
played deputy national secu-
rity adviser Kate Harper on the
show during its last three sea-
sons.

Harvard and Princeton Universi-
ties, was a senior economist at the
White House Council of Econom-
ic Advisers. He also worked as the
assistant director of the Division
of Research and Statistics at the
Federal Reserve Board and as
the deputy assistant secretary for
economic policy at the Treasury
Department.
Elmendorf began his address
by explaining the current prob-
lem with the federal deficit,
noting that past policies are
becoming more expensive as the
Baby Boomer generation reaches
retirement age.
"Lawmakers will need to adopt
a combination of policies that
will require people to pay more
for their government, accept less
in government benefits and ser-
vices, or both," Elmendorf said.
"However. achieving the amount,

of deficit reduction necessary to
shrink the debt relative to the size
of the economy - or even to keep
the debt from growing - will be a
formidable task."
Elmendorf emphasized how
challenging the issue is by out-
lining multiple significant policy
changes that would take care of
only less than half of the most
easily reachable target.
In order to tackle the issue, he
provided three choices: major
reductions in benefits, significant
reduction of the federal govern-
ment's role and the substantial
raising of revenues above his-
torical average. Elmendorf said
at least one, if not more, will be
needed to reach the solution.
Elmendorf emphasized that
the CBO does not recommend any
specific plan of action, and firmly
promotes itself as a non-

biased source of information.
During the question and
answer session after his speech, a
student suggested that it is not a
matter of if, but when, our econ-
omy will collapse. Elmendorf
responded that it is not a matter
of when at all, stressing the many
choices the federal government
can make to bring our country out
of this crisis if they make deci-
sions now.
Business sophomore Ray Batra
said he thinks learning about
the budget and current financial
climate is critically important,
especially when coming from a
professional in the field.
"It's not too often that we can
get someone from the executive
level of policy making to come in
and be able to explain problems
that affect the entire nation,"
Batra said.

Vishal Mehta, a sophomore at
the University's Dearborn cam-
pus, was excited to take advan-
tage of Elmendorf's non-partisan
perspective on the issue.
"It's great to get an unbiased
opinion now and then," Mehta
said. "What you hear inthe media
is really right wing or left wing.
It's nice to have somebody unbi-
ased come and give you the facts."
LSA sophomore Devon Mulry
said she was encouraged to
come by her professor, Gregory
Markus, who teaches a course on
the budget and the current finan-
cial crisis.
"Professor Markus thought it
would be a good idea to come and
I thought the talk sounded inter-
esting." Mulry said. "Right now I
think that both sides need to get
together and stop being so parti-
san."

stations next Monday. The ad
reads, "In any war between the
civilized man and the savage,

port Israel. Defeat Jihad."
The ad was plastered on San
Francisco city buses in recent
weeks, prompting some artists
to deface the ads and remove
some of the words, including
"Jihad," or holy war. The blog-
ger, Pamela Geller, said she filed
suit Thursday in the nation's
capital to post the ad in Wash-
ington's transit system after
officials declined to put up the
ad in light of the uproar in the
Middle East over the anti-Islam
film.
Abdul Yasar, a New York sub-

self an observant Muslim, said
Geller's ad was insensitive in an
unsettling climate for Muslims.
"If you don't want to see what

After.the renovation of South

the University will move for-

of West Quad Residence Hall.
Harper added that this effort will
largely complete the renovations
of the Hill neighborhood and the

Harper reiterated that Baits I
on North Campus will not reopen
as a residence hall, but may be

the future.
REGENTS VOTE TO RAISE
PRESIDENT MARY SUE
COLEMAN'S SALARY
The regents also voted to
increase University President
Mary Sue Coleman's salary by 3
percent, a total of $17,574. In addi-
tion to her base salary, Coleman
also receives a $100,000 reten-
tion bonus, $55,350 in direct and
supplemental retirement income,
the use of the University-owned
President's House and an auto-
mobile.
Before her raise, Coleman's
base salary was $585,783. But,
immediately after the regents
unanimously agreed to the raise,
Coleman said she would donate
the entire increase to study
abroad scholarships at the Uni-
versity to encourage students to
experience overseas studying
opportunities.
"I'm perfectly well compensat-
ed," Coleman said. "I want more
students to travel abroad."
Regent S. Martin Taylor
(D-Gross Pointe Farms) said
Coleman's base salary is low
compared to other similarly sized
and comparable colleges and uni-
versities, and praised her in her
annual performance review.
"The base salary of the Presi-
dent is certainly not out of line,"
WEST WING
From Page 1
Mary McCormack, who Bridg-
et McCormack said has been
helpful in her election bid, asked
her sister whether the advertise-
ment might aid the campaign.
When Prof. McCormack respond-
ed that she thought it would, Mary
McCormack asked West Wing
cast mates Allison Janney and
Bradley Whitford, who she had
kept in touch with most closely, to
participate.
"And then it kind of snow-
balled," Bridget Mary McCormack
said in an interview Thursday
afternoon. "I think it was very
generous of everybody to give up
their time and get it together."
The video cost the campaign

stated Shirvell was "delusional"
and a "troubled and immature
young man," according to the
Detroit Free Press.
By requesting a medical exami-
nation, Gordon said she hopes to
prove her opinions are true and
disprove the defamation suit.
Shirvell said he believes the pur-
pose of requesting the examina-
tion is to encourage him to drop
his lawsuit against her.
"I think it's frivolous," Shirvell
said in an interview. "She is com-
pletely out of control. Deb Gordon

She's got a vendetta against me.
She has made me an object of her

low."
Last year, the regents gave
Coleman a 2.75 percent raise,
which she also donated to the
University to help fund study
abroad scholarships.
UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
BUDGET REACHES
ALL-TIME HIGH
Stephen Forrest, the Univer-
sity's vice president for research,
reported to the regents that the
University's research budget has
grown this year by approximately
3 percent. The total research bud-
get has risen to $1.27 billion, an
increase of $37.5 million, the larg-
est in the University's history.
Still, Forrest cautioned that
he didn't expect a rapid reinvest-
ment in research from the gov-
ernment in years to come.
"Looking ahead, there's no
doubt that the overall pace of
growth of funding from the fed-
eral government is slowing," For-
rest told the regents.
According to a press release
issued by the University, the
increased funding came from a
variety of government depart-
ments and agencies, absorbing
the loss of funds from the end of
the American Recovery and Rein-
vestment Act. Private investment
also rose by 5.6 percent to $42.8
million.
BOARD DISCUSSES
IMPACT OF COURSERA
PROGRAM
The month's featured presen-
tation to the regents focused on
the University's involvement in
the online education clearing-
house, Coursera. The Univer-
sity of Michigan was one of the
launch partners for Coursera,
alongside Stanford University,
University of Pennsylvania and
Princeton University.
Martha Pollack, the vice pro-
vost for academic and budgetary
affairs, explained that the Uni-
versity is expanding its role in the
world of online education.
anyway," McCormack told the
group. "You don't have to sell any
new people; you don't have to con-
vince any new people. You just
have to convince people to fill out
that section of the ballot."
In an interview after the meet-
ing she said she thinks most Uni-
versity students did not know that
voting for Democratic Party can-
didates across the ballot doesn't
include candidates for state
Supreme Court. Supreme Court
candidates are nominated by the
state Democratic Party, but are
placed on the nonpartisan section
of the ballot.
The ad never mentions that
McCormack is a Democrat, but
the President Josiah Bartlet, the
fictional president in 'The West
Wing' who was played by Sheen,
was a Democrat and several of the
actors, including Sheen have advo-
cated forliberal causes in the past.
Through she said she thought
University voters are informed,
few of the approximately 50 peo-
ple who attended one of her events
the week before knew to fill out
the nonpartisan ballot.
She said many of them asked,
"'Oh, did they change that this
year?"'

"No, it's always been that way,"
McCormack said. "So I think
they've never voted in a Supreme
Court election."
LSA junior Alexandra Brill, the
chair of the University's chapter
of College Democrats, said in an
interview after the meeting that
she agreed with McCormack, add-
court, but until then he is under no
obligation to do so.
Gordon said she believes
Shirvell's argument for the defa-
mation suit clashes with the
defense in the Armstrong case,
notingthatthoughthefirstamend-
ment protects opinions, it doesn't
allow people to lie. According to
Gordon, Shirvell's blog statements
included lies passed off as facts.
"He's so illogical and it's shock-
ing because he's a lawyer," she
said.
Though Armstrong is not
involved in the current defama-
tion lawsuit, Gordon' said she
believes Shirvell's motives are
rooted in the original case.
"He's hell-bent on convincing
the world he's right," she said.
Shirvell said his appeal of the
Armstrong decision, in addition
to a civil service appeal to get his
job back in the attorney general's
office, will continue as long as

"What we can do is we can
shift some of the pure knowledge
transfer to the online format,
and free up more time and more
resources for hands-on work,"
Pollack said.
Pollack said many of the cours-
es the University has offered have
drawn thousands of students to
the online courses, adding that
offering the content online was
consistent with the University's
mission as a public entity to offer
its talents and information.
"We think this is a very valu-
able and exciting way to connect
with our alumni, prospective stu-
dents and with the citizens of the
state," Pollack said. "And since
I'm the budget person, it provides
potentially even revenue, and
we're really looking into that."
Coursera's most popular
classes are open to anyone with
Internet access, and therefore
impossible to monetize, Pollack
explained. However, she said the
sale of certificates of completion
for some courses is one way to
potentially draw revenue from
the service, though no formal
policy has yet been instituted.
University students, faculty and
staff have free access to any
course in Coursera's catalog so
long as it is used on campus.
Scott Page, the director of
the center for complex systems,
taught the first Coursera class
offered by the University, which
attracted about 90,000 students,
"Interacting with 40,000 peo-
ple is really a strange thingto do,"
Page said. "I've had deans of pub-
lic health schools in South Africa
and Czechoslovakia come to me
and ask, 'Can we use your particu-
lar set of lectures for this unit in
our course?' It's been a fabulous
opportunity for me to share."
Page said the modular focus
of the course was beneficial for
student scheduling because they
could jump in and out of the class
whenever they wanted without
getting lost. However, he also
said the feedback from an in-
person course was much greater
than what was available with
Coursera.
ing that educating voters on the
issue will be a focus for the Col-
lege Democrats. She called the
low turnout among Democrats for
Michigan's 2010 Supreme Court
elections the "biggest misstep that
year."
Only about one in four voters
who fill in the presidential ballot
choose to complete the non-parti-
san ballot, accordingto Brill.
That drop-off rate inspired her
to encourage students to advocate
for McCormack, for whom she
interns, and the two other Demo-
cratic nominees for the Republi-
can-controlled Michigan Supreme
Court.
"The electionis decided bysuch
a small fraction of people that it's
really important that we change
that," Brill said.
Beyond working with organi-
zations within the state, the can-
didate has also received national
attention for working to increase
awareness of an election category
that often yields low voter turnout
in Michigan.
Last month, McCormack
appeared on Chelsea Handler's
talk show on E!, "Chelsea Lately".
Handler later donated $3,400 to
McCormack's campaign, accord-

ing to the Michigan Campaign
Finance Network.
McCormack has also been a suc-
cessful fundraiser. As of August
24th, she had raised $317,830 and
has $205,096 on hand, more than
any other non-incumbent candi-
date for the state Supreme Court,
accordingto the MCFN.

as groups from the greater Ann
Arbor area. Appearances were
also made by representatives
from the Leslie Science Center,
Recycle Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor
Transportation Authority Bus
Services and Natural Area Pres-
ervation.
During the event, student
could learn about sustainabil-'
ity groups and their projects
through interactive games, raf-
-fes, Q&A sessions and giveaways
of recycled pencils, pins, reusable
tote bags and food.
Along with the interactive pre-
sentations, cooking demonstra-
tions were made every half hour
to show students how sustain-
ability can be enjoyable and even
delectable. Rufus - a life-size
walking recycling bin - joined
the fun by mingling with students
and posing for an occasional
photo opportunity.
Barbara Hagan, the direc-
tor of Earthfest and sustainabil-
ity administrator in the office for
Campus Sustainability, said par-
ticipationhas increased compared
to years past due to its outreach to
Ann Arbor organizations.
"We have more booths this year
because we expanded it to include
some external (Ann Arbor)
groups," she said. "I think they
bring a lot to the table ... we've got
somegreatgroups here."
Linda Polo, the event coordi-
nator of EarthFest said students
seemed enthusiastic, adding that
this year's event drew a large
crowd because it appealed to a
majority of students.
"We are really focusing on the
things students love, like food,"
she said. "That's why we have
apples and donuts and chef demos.
Everything here is centered on
being local and making sure that
what we buy isn't going to waste."
Nicole Berger, a Planet Blue
ambassador coordinator, said
there were many changes added
to this year's festival. Among
them was a photo-booth pledge
system through the Planet Blue
Community Awareness station,
where students were able to write
down their sustainability goals

support is hard to fathom,
because it will shape students'
experiences and opportunities
for decades to come," Coleman
said. "That is the power of this
gift: Its immense transforma-
tion of the U-M experience. It is
creativity personified."
Gunalan Nadarajan, the dean
of the Penny W. Stamps School
of Art and Design, lauded the
Stamps for their dedication to
aiding University students.
"These are amazing people
who have an incredible commit-
ment to the school," Nadarajan
said. "I know that they have
confidence in the direction that
the school has taken in the last
10 to 12 years."
Penny and E. Roe Stamps
have contributed significant-
ly to the University over the
years, beginning in 2001 with
the' Penny W. Stamps Distin-

guished Visitors Series, which
has brought dozens of artists to
the Michigan Theater to share
their experiences and perspec-
tives with students.
The Stamps family also
supported a public gallery on
Central Campus to promote
awareness of the arts for the
general student body.
Penny Stamps is a graduate
of the School of Art and Design
and previously served as the
principal designer for Boston
firm Penny W. Stamps Inte-
riors. She also co-chaired the

and take a photo alongside their
pledge.
Berger said this was the first
time the group incorporated pho-
tography while pledging, making
it more personal for those partici-
pating. The pledge photos will be
posted on the group's website in
the upcoming weeks.
Kristyn Sonnenberg, a student
services assistant in the Physics
Department, pledged to become
more conscientious about where
her garbage is going.
"I made a pledge to start a
compost bin, because it's some-
thing I've wanted to do for a while
because I've noticed most of my
trash (is better off) in a compost
bin than a landfill," she said. "I
think it would be a really great
thing if the University did start
using(more composting). It would
probably be alot to implement, but
I think they could start small."
LSA sophomore Corey Walsh,
a member of LSA Student
Government, said the group's
subcommittee Taking Respon-
sibility for the Earth and Envi-
ronment, attended EarthFest
to increase student awareness
about sustainability and to pro-
vide alternative, eco-friendly
options for students. The LSA-
SG booth gave students the
opportunity to make their own
homemade cleaning products
and self-watering planters.
Walsh said the University's
sustainable efforts demonstrate
leadership in the initiative and
serve as a role model for other
campuses.
"Sustainability is so important,
not only to our campus, but to the
nation as a whole," he said. "Peo-
ple look to our institution as an
example, and I think that we're
setting a great example."
LSA sophomore Jay Park, the
secretary of Students for Clean
Energy, said the event helped
spread the word about the newly
formed organization.
"It's a big help right now
(because) we're trying to recruit
and get the man power that we
need to spread the awareness of
the detrimental effects of dirty
energy," Park said.

along with Stephen M. Ross and
others, which ultimately raised
$3.2 billion for the University
between 2004 and 2008.
Stamps said in a press state-
ment that she has been pleased
to see her donations help stu-
dents thrive.
"It has been very reward-
ing for us to be a part of A&D's
growth and development during
these past 15 years," Stamps said
in the release. "We have been
pleased to see our investments
in the school make a compel-
ling difference to the school's
excellence and prominence, and
our involvement has escalated
as a result. We are enormously
proud of the programs we sup-
port and want to ensure that
they continue to benefit stu-
dents for generations."
Chrisstina Hamilton, direc-
tor of the Stamps Lecture Series,
said the Series has been a great
resource for students seeking to
network and learn more about

the field.
"It's an absolutely wonder-

riding and repairs, said Earth-
fest helped give the organization
exposurewhileteachingstudents
about environmentally friendly
modes of transportation.
"The more people that are rid-
ing bikes (equals) fewer people
that ride cars," Schultz said. "It's
a great way to maintain fitness
and not guzzle gas. Ann Arbor is
a great town for biking and as far
as we're concerned, our mission
is to get more bikes on the road by
making the barrier to repairs as
low as we can."
LSA freshman Adi Radhakrish-
nan said he was initially drawn to
the event for the food and other
giveaways, but then became inter-
ested in sustainable efforts after
perusing the displays.
Radhakrishnan said while the
University is becoming increas-
ingly sustainable, there are still
changes to be made in order to
better ensure the highest level of
environmentally-friendly prac-
tices.
"It's definitely getting there ...
I know one thing they could defi-
nitely do is educate students about
composting," Radhakrishnan
said. "AtSouthQuadorWestQuad
(the University could) have com-
post bins so that you can throw
(appropriate) trash in there'
While EarthFest highlighted
the major sustainable efforts at
the University, there are other
measures being taken to reach
Coleman's 2025 goal. Hagan
said the University responded
to student concern about water
bottle usage and took iqitiativd to
reduce plastic water bottle waste
by providing the incoming class
of 2016 with reusable bottles.
"We knew that students want-
ed to reduce the amount of indi-
vidual use water bottles because
those are not good for the planet,"
Hagan said. "We thought it was
important for us to support that
student voice, so we wanted to
put an infrastructure in place."
To accommodate for the usage
of reusable water bottles, Hagan
explained that CSG funded 18
water refill stations in campus
buildings, including libraries
and prominent auditoriums,
with each department paying for
installation. Now, more than 100
refill locations on campus are
available to students.
ful thing, it's a huge gift to the
community, it's a gift to the
University," Hamilton said.
"When Penny started the series,
her objective was to create an
opportunity for students to
have connection with real prac-
titioners in the field and not just
academics."
The Stamps family has also
helped fund the construction
of the Stamps. Auditorium on
North Campus, facilities in the
Ross Academic Center and the
School of Education, in addition
to funding the Stamps Scholar-
ships at the University. The pro-
gram hosts 72 students per year,
and supporti has been guaran-
teed through 2024.
"The Stamps gift provides us
with much-needed resources in
supporting creative work at the
University," University Provost
Philip Hanlon said in a press
release. "This sends a signal to
educators and other philanthro-
pists, and is a significant invest-
ment that will continue to grow

as the school pursues its other
funding goals."

Checks and balances
Michigan should adopt a uniform ballot
T his week, a Michigan voting rights coalition filed a law-
suit against Michigan Secretary of State, Ruth Johnson
for her dictum regarding voting and registration. The new
ballots require voters to check a box in order to affirm that they
are U.S. citizens before they are granted voting registration. The
redundancy of this question has caused significant problems, so
much so that one Shelby Township man who didn't check the box
was barred from voting in August. Several organizations, includ-
ing the American Civil Liberties Union and Latin Americans for
Social and Economic Development, have filed lawsuits against
Johnson for violating the 14th Amendment. Michigan counties
are decisively split, some refusing to use the new ballots while
others have been implementing them. The state needs to create a
uniform system that eradicates any misleading paths as citizens

Don't get lost in the rush

t's that special time of year
again, when over 1,000 under-
graduate girls put on their
best game faces
and embark on -
a formal mis-
sion known as
fall recruitment
for Greek life.
Sorority hous-
es have been
preparing for
months and now SARAH
the long hours SKALUBA
of screaming,
singing, clap-
ping, yelling and perfecting every
single set have come down to this.
Enforced prerequisites include
an online registration process
(photo mandatory, of course), awk-
ward conversations with complete
strangers and the unnecessarily
stressful process of sprinting from
one house to another in a short
period of time without sweating
through your dress or ruining your
hair. So it's an eccentric process
to say the least, one that manages
to take up a ton of time during the
recruitment period, which covers
the first four weeks of class.
But it's not for nothing. After sur-
viving the first four weeks most girls
end up with a bid to a specific house
on campus. It's become a more com-
petitive process over the last few
years, not only at Michigan but at
universities across the country. And
now, the price girls are willing to pay
to end up in their "dream" house has
reached new heights.
We've all heard of college coaches
before, the paid mentors that help
high school seniors manage their
college applications, resumes and
essay responses. But the concept of
rush coaches may be a little foreign.
Recently, professional image consul-
tants, coupled with rush preparation
services, have been charging up to
$8,000 for coaching and guidance
regarding sorority recruitment.
This intensive prepping is not
only taking place in the South, where
recruitment is considered a more

rigorous process, but in the Mid-
west and on the East Coast as well.
Women have been paying excessive
amounts of money for the advice
of professional image consultants,
such as Samantha Von Sperling. She
charges a whopping $300 per hour
for her personal coaching, during
which she advises young women on
exactly whatto wear, what to say and
how to act during the rush process.
If a couple hours of private prepping
don't meet your needs though, don't
fret, because she also offers week-
long boot camps for the seriously
anxious rushees at the meager price
of $8,000.
I'm sorry, but this "rush coaching"
concept seems absolutely absurd -
and mind you, these words are com-
ing from the mouth of a "sorority
girl" herself. Recruitment as a whole
is alreadya stressful enough process,
one that feels a little bit like inter-
viewing and a whole lot like speed
dating. Girls are encouraged to try
and be themselves so that they can
find their best "fit" and end up in a
house that feels both welcoming and
inclusive. So, if rushees are feeling
pressured to drop tons of money on
expensive preparation courses and
pre-rush boot camps, then some-
thing isn't quite right.
Many University students hold
preconceived notions regardingrush.
Whether they view recruitment
as the willingness to "pay for one's
friends" or a fierce process based on
an individual's outward appearance
and beauty, the negative stereotypes
surrounding rush are numerous. But
if girls are in fact willingto pay hun-
dreds, even thousands, of dollars in
order to get a bid into their top soror-
ity then these stereotypes are in a
sense being validated.
Let me be blatantly honest: If a
house doesn't like you because of
how you dress, how you apply your
makeup or the way you talk, then
do you actually want to be a sister
there? The fact that so many girls are
willing to pay 'professionals' to tell
them how they need to do their hair,
what exactly they should be wear-

ing to each set, what conversations
they need to be having, and-how to
come off as sociable and confident, is
extremely alarming.
Don't put on a
false persona for
recruitment.
Going through rush should not
be a long, drawn-out stage perfor-
mance. In fact, no acting should
be involved at all. Companies like
Rushbiddies that pride themselves
on fully preparing each "chick"
for sorority recruitment should be
ashamed. Rush already has the neg-
ative stigma of being fake and catty,
so there's really no need to add to the
stereotype and further strengthen
its validity.
These rush-prep services are
teaching young women that profes-
sional training and primping is nec-
essary in order to be successful and
end up in a "top" house come bid day.
This is detrimental to rushees who
should be staying true to their self
throughout the hectic process, rath-
er than putting on a false persona to
impress a certain sorority's sisters.
I've been through rush once, and
managed to slide by just fine on my
own. Was I dropped from houses I
originally liked? Yes. Was it a long,
relatively painful experience that
took up way too much time? Yes. But
I would never in a million years pre-
tend to be someone I'm not, or urge
another rushee to do the same.
So as I'm sure you've heard
countless times, good luck with
recruitment, and remember come
Sunday, may the odds be ever in
your favor.

make their way to the polls.
The ACLU asserts that the erratic use of
the checkboxes violates the 14th Amendment,
which calls for uniformity in a state's voting
process. Because some counties are refusing
to implement the question on their ballots,
the system doesn't reach all Michigan vot-
ers. Glenn Rehahn, a plaintiff in the case, was
refused the chance to vote because he did not
check the citizenship box, though he claims
a county clerk told him that answering was
optional.
Aside from legal repercussions, the U.S.
citizenship checkbox has spurred debate as
to whether or not it's even necessary. John-
son stated that she wished to give non-citi-
zens one final chance to refrain from voting
and elude repercussions stemming from vot-
ing illegally. It's common knowledge that in
order to register to vote a person must pro-
vide proof of their U.S. citizenship. So while
the checkbox question is valid, including it
on the ballot seems unnecessary, redundant
and confusing. There's no reason to require a
person who has already proved their citizen-
ship in voter registration to affirm it again

on the ballot. A recent study conducted by
an investigative news team discovered that
cases of voting fraud are miniscule. The orga-
nization, News21, analyzed more than 2,000
cases of reported fraud since 2000, finding
that a mere 10 were actual incidents of "voter
impersonation."
Nov.6 is fast approaching, yet the Michigan
voting system is still divided. Due to this bal-
lot mishap, some citizens may be deprived of
their right to vote. The Michigan government
needs to ensure that the difference in ballots
doesn't reflect a variance in statewide vot-
ing policy: Whether or not the citizen check-
boxes are optional -and whether or not they
remain on the ballot at all - should not be an
issue this close to the election. It's unthink-
able to deny even one registered U.S. citizen
the right to vote, and inexcusable to do so on a
technicality. Johnson's ballot has many faults
- it's misleading, affects Michigan citizens'
ability to vote and may be unconstitutional.
Voting is a system created for citizens to voice
their opinions and no one should have to fight
to do so.

College Republicans lack
clearfiscal outlook
TO THE DAILY:
Thursday's article about young Republi-
cans' thoughts as we approach the Novem-
ber election illustrates just how poorly the
Republican Party platform correlates with
the issues that matter to many college stu-
dents. While it is promising that Republicans
at the University of Michigan support LGBT
rights, we must not forget that the official
GOP platform, endorsed by Mitt Romney,
includes a constitutional amendment ban-
ning same-sex marriage. The party platform
also seeks to prohibit abortion in all cases,
including when a woman's life is at risk. The
Republican Party, the so-called champions
of "small government," is by no means small
when it decides to legislate a woman's right
to her body. Missouri Senate candidate Todd
Akin's comments last month are a striking
example of just how out of touch the Republi-
can Party is on social issues.
While College Republicans' realization
that their party is out of touch on social issues
may be promising, their misguided support
of the GOP's economic plans is cause for
concern. Regarding Thursday's article, the
interviewees' lack of clear plans for economic
recovery is just another case of the party's
use of rhetoric instead of clear planning. His
plans to revamp the tax code strongly favor
the extremely wealthy, who will see great
tax cuts while middle-class Americans watch
their taxes increase. To compensate for the
decrease in government revenue, Romney
will likely decrease government spend-

ing. Where will these 'spending cuts occur?
As with most of his economic plans, it's not
entirely clear.
President Obama has proven himself capa-
ble of creating jobs and growing the economy
during his term in office. Over the past 27
months, private sector jobs have grown by
4.5 million, a greater growth than seen dur-
ing the term of any other U.S. President. He
spent much of his speech at the Democratic
National Convention earlier this month dis-
cussing his support for the middle class, con-
crete plans for future job growth, and his
optimism for the future. President Obama
tried to get the American Jobs Act passed, a
piece of legislation that would be a critical
boon to our jobs sector. The Republican-con-
trolled House never even voted on the Jobs
Act, likely because they were too busy com-
plaining about the Affordable Care Act. For
the past four years, President Obama and the
Democratic Party have been the leaders in
economic reform and creating a favorable job
climate for college students.
As I read Thursday's article, I was
intrigued by the College Republicans' inabil-
ity to cite policies that would help our econ-
omy recover. The College Republicans must
be following in the example of the national
party. On both social and economic issues,
the Democratic Party has proven itself to
be the superior party of progress. This elec-
tion, we have a clear choice between two
ideologies: one with backward social poli-
cies and a lack of fiscal clarity, and one that
promises to move our country forward.
Jacob Light
Representative of College Democrats

There are moments every
once in a while when it
seems as if everything
comes together
perfectly -
when personal,
political and
global issues of -
our era all enter
into a strange
harmony.
This week YONAH
was one of those LIEBERMAN
moments.
This week I
observed Rosh
Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.
Politically, Mitt Romney's "47 per-
cent" comments went viral this
week. Globally, this week marked
the one-year anniversary of the
Occupy Wall Street movement.
There are 10 days between Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the
Day of Atonement. Those days are
meant to give each person time to
reflect on sins of the past year and
then repent. We blow the shofar, or
ram's horn, multiple times through-
out the services. It's an interesting
sound, but has never meant much to
me. But this year, I felt it penetrate
my innermost thoughts. I could feel
the sound reverberate in my head,
shaking something loose.
By now, I'm sure you all have
heard of the deeply revealing com-
ments Governor Romney made at a
$50,000-a-plate fundraiser he held.
in May. If not, I'll let the Governor
speak for himself: "There are 47
percent [of Americans] who will
[vote for Obama], who are depen-
dent upon government, who believe
that they are victims ... my job is
not to worry about those people. I'll
never convince them they should
take personal responsibility and
care for their lives." Seriously, I
can't make this shit up.
On Monday, thousands of people
in New York City and around the

world marched in the streets to
honor Occupy's one-year anniver-
sary. My Twitter feed started blow-
ing up with live updates and ironic
hashtags. I'll admit to being glued to
my computer for most of last Octo-
ber as marches, direct actions and
violent police crackdowns were live=
streamed directly to my computer.
The Occupy movement may not have
succeeded in forging a brand new
society, but it did shift the national
conversation dramatically.
This shift is where these three
separate events of the week come
together. For once, people were
talking about the massive income
inequality in this country and
demanding that the rich pay their
fair share.
On the eve of Rosh Hashanah
(and the Occupy anniversary), more
than 2,000 people gathered in Zuc-
cotti Park in New York City in a
service organized by a group call-
ing itself Occupy Judaism. During
the sermon, the rabbi highlighted
the common theme that runs across
the three events of this week: "The
Torah reminds us again and again
- you didn't earn what's yours by
your hands alone. You earned it with
the blessing of the creator, who also
blessed you with the good fortune to
be able to share with those in need."
Mitt Romney was never going
to be the poster child of the right
wing. In his heart, he's simply a pol-
itician who believes what he thinks
people want him to believe. Just go
online and check out some of his
statements when he ran for the U.S.
Senate in Massachusetts. Ironi-
cally, he has become a poster child
for all that the Occupy Movement
stands against. He hides his money
in offshore accounts to avoid pay-
ing taxes. He refuses to release his
tax returns because they embarrass
him. He openly called corporations
"people" and supports the Supreme
Court decision on Citizens United.

He labels those who were not given
the same opportunities as he as
"dependent on government" and
self-appointed "victims."
Rosh Hashanah,
the 47 percent
and OWS.
During Rosh Hashanah, my
grandfather told me that he had
never known a time of greater parti-
sanship and division in this country.
There is an undeniable drama that
exists in this moment that we live in.
I think it's that drama that moved
me during the shofar blasts this
week. It forced me to wake up and
smell the goddamn roses. Action
needs tobe taken.
This election is far too close for
comfort. Romney's "47 percent"
comments reveal the extent to
which he will go to pander to his
far-right-wing donor base. Once
elected, he'll be forced to bend to
their interests - at least until he
wins a second term - I shudder just
writing that. Students were instru-
mental in the election of Barack
Obama four years ago - let's do it
again this time. Get registered and
go vote.
So let me take this opportunity
to wish a happy, healthy new year
to Barack Obama, to Occupy Wall
Street and to all of you - even you,
Mitt. May it be a year to take advan-
tage of this exciting moment in his-
tory we all live in. May it be a year
when together, we secure a second
term for President Obama.

play unfolds, a rebellion ensues,
murder plots are revealed and a
passionate love affair develops.
"The Tempest" is a tale com-
prised of violent strife, romance
and certainly compassion and

forgiveness..
The performance is separated
into two parts: In the first piece,
the public will encounter a replica
of the characters from the play, in
which the dancers present a neo-
pantomime style.
"In a sense, the first part is not
dance," said Eric Beauchesne, the
dancer playing Prospero. "It's
instead a bridge between dance
and pantomime and theater. For
me it's the first time, as a dance
artist, that I have done this type
of movement."
All the characters, except Pros-
pero, appear in white costumes
with white masks, making the
dancers appear subhuman. How-
ever, the white costumes also
create a unity among them, hop-
ing to convey how humans are
comprised of many of the same
emotions, such as hope, love and
anger. Furthermore, Beauchesne
explained that white is very sim-
ple, forcing the audience to focus
on the language the dancers are
communicating. Even though the
audience won't be able to recog-
nize the faces of the performers,
they will be able to determine
whom they represent by specific
elements of their costumes.
In the second part of the piece,
choreographer CyrstalPiteimple-
ments a more traditional dance
style, focusing on the abstract
movement and the physicality of
the dancers. The costumes are
also altered to an urban style.
Beauchesne explained how Pite is

interested in telling a story with
alternate perspectives and thus
uses the two sections of the per-
formance to allow the audience to
enter the work through different
doors. Prospero, for example, is
more than simply the main char-
acter. As the only one not dressed
in white, he acts as a creator of the
entire production, manipulating
the white puppet-like dancers.
"At the beginning, I make
the show happen," Beauchesne
said. "And in the second half, I
get caught up by the show, as if I
was swallowed by it. In the sec-
ond half, I perform a very physi-
cal dance, which includes a lot of
partnering. The dancers in the
second part are not in white any-
more but they are still embodying
a certain color of these characters
and you can still feel that. You can
relate to them as the real charac-
ters and notthe replica ones."
Beauchesne believes that
"Kidd Pivot: The Tempest Rep-
lica" is not only about the nar-
ration of a classic tale, but about
Pite's choreography and how her
intense style formulates a set of
emotionsandimages for the audi-
ence to experience.
Even though this performance
is based on the story of "The
Tempest," Pite focuses on the
plight of the main characters and
the motifs of revenge and passion
in emotional and psychological
terms. She also plays with the ten-
sions and violence that develop
between the characters.

"Her choreography makes you
feel that the dance is just happen-
ing to the dancer," Beauchesne
said. "It looks like someone is
puppeteering that person. It
seems that the human being is let-
ting go and giving up to a deeper
language and energy, which as a
viewer I found very compelling
and touching to watch."

Assistant Arts Editor
If James Agee were alive
today, "Detropia" is the kind of
work he mightbe producing. Like
Agee, the direc-
tor-producer
team of Heidi
Ewing and .o
Rachel Grady Detropia
(who brought At the
us the powerful Michigan
yet disturbing
documentary Loki
"Jesus Camp") -
combines factual reporting with
a poet's sense of lyrical beauty
hidden beneath human sorrow.
Their latest project focuses
on Detroit's downfall as a sym-
bol for the disappearance of the
country's manufacturing base.
Though, perhaps more impor-
tantly, Ewing and Grady pres-
ent individuals who embody the
. resilience of Detroit: No matter
how bad things get, no matter
how many abandoned houses
burn to the ground, the people
shown here are Detroiters for
life, wedded to the city they call
home.
To its credit, "Detropia" is
an exercise in restraint - never
preaching, simply telling and
showing. It's not a cautionary
tale. What happened in Detroit is
an old story to most by this point.
What it is, rather, is a snapshot
- a close-up examination of the
pathos and humor present with-
in the complex web of economic
problems plaguing the Motor
City.
There's Crystal Starr, an ama-
teur video blogger, who explores
and documents the wreckage
of old office buildings. Like a
kind of tour guide of American
ruins, she describes what these
sites may have looked like in
their golden age. There's George
McGregor, an official from the
United Auto Workers, who des-
perately tries to offer counsel to
union members facing extreme
pay cuts. And then there's bar
owner Tommy Stephens, the
film's emotional core, whose bar
depends on the success of the
General Motors plant down the
street. Stephens' narration rings
of grandfatherly wisdom. Capi-
talism might be a good system,
but it exploits the weak, he says.
His words don't ring of contempt
or frustration, just the weary
tone of a man who's seen and
been through too much struggle.
Nothing in this film is sugar-
coated. Throughout the movie,
facts appear on screen, remind-
ing viewers of Detroit's drastic
population decline, of its battles
with bankruptcy. We see young
men razing decaying buildings
for scrap metal. We see pan-
oramic shots of Detroit's skyline
in the evening, golden rays of
a sun setting on structures that
can still be described as majes-
tic, metaphors for a city that just
won't quit.
In a sense, this movie is a char-
acter study of a city that refuses
to fade into collective memory as

a place that once was. Because,
according to those depicted, it's a
place that very much still is.
At a town meeting, citizens
erupt in outrage over a strange
idea from Mayor Dave Bing's
office: concentrating Detroiters
in the few populated areas left
in the city, leaving the rest of
the land open for urban farming.
These people's lives and homes
are at stake. Why should they
place their faith in the hands of
city officials who have clearly
failed them? -More poignantly,
a group of men are interviewed
on their porch. They laugh when
asked about the mayor's urban
farming initiative, noting the
absurdity of a gangbanger with
a gun trying to plant vegetables
on a farm.
From a city-planning perspec-
tive, however, you can see how it
might make sense. After all, pub-
lic services such as streetlights
and buses have had to be cut.
Why not downsize and, to quote
the over-used adage, "do more
with less?" The reason, as Ewing
and Grady so skillfully demon-
strate, is because a city, unlike
a company, is a living, breath-
ing thing. And it can't be fixed
overnight. Change must happen
organically, the movie suggests.
Statistics and
storytelling in
eye-opening
'Detropia'
Employment once readily
available to middle-class work-
ers at the Big Three automakers
may have been outsourced to
China and Mexico.
This doesn't stop a James
Brown impersonator from fall-
ing to his knees in a small Detroit
nightclub, feigning the panting
sweat the King of Soul made
famous. It doesn't read as tragic
or even pathetic. It's more like
a sign of hope, like the singer
knows desperate times can still
be overcome, if you just have
faith.
"Detropia" is dedicated to
those who work every day to
improve the city. While a few
bohemians rave about cheap
housing and the numerous
opportunities for artists Detroit
offers, the movie doesn't end on
any sort of contrived note - it
makes clear that Detroit is still
hurting.
But in the final scene, as we
watch an opera singer's voice
fill the now deserted Michigan
Central Train Depot, it's hard
not to feel a little bit optimis-
tic. From here, the screen goes
to black, abruptly concluding. It
feels cut off, unfinished. Which
may in itself be a sign of hope:
Detroit isn't over. It persists.
And the future of this once-great
American city is a story that still
remains to be told.

'M' readies for Fighting Irish

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Editor
This is Denard Robinson's
favorite time of the year - Notre
Dame week.
The senior quarterback has
torched the Fighting Irish
defense as Michigan football's
signal caller each of the past
two seasons. There's something
about this rivalry that brings out
the best in him.
In the 2010 matchup in South
Bend, Robinson accounted for
502 of Michigan's 532 total
yards, with over 200 passing and
rushing yards. In the 2011 show-
down in Ann
Arbor - Mich-
igan Stadium's
first-ever Notre Dame
night game - Matchup:
he threw for Michigan
338 yards and 2-1; ND 3-0

found wide

zone for the NBC
game-winning
touchdown with two ticks left.
"Denard playing his heart
out," said redshirt junior run-
ning back Fitzgerald Toussaint
on what he remembers of last
year's game. "I think that's one
of the better games he's played
here, personally. Then you had
guys out there playing with him,
playingtheir heart out for him.
"(Notre Dame) plays hard,
and I believe when you have
competition, that makes you
bring out your best game."
Toussaint did not play in last
season's duel with Notre Dame
because of a shoulder injury.
His return to the starting lineup
for this season's episode adds
another weapon to Michigan
coach Brady Hoke's offensive
arsenal that his counterpart
Brian Kelly didn't have to deal
with last year.
Toussaint rebounded a bit
last week against Massachu-
setts, picking up 85 yards on just
15 touches following his rough
return to the lineup the week
before against Air Force. But

Senior quarterback Denard Robinson has engineered last-minute comebacks in

on a front seven with talent he
has yet to see this season.
Up front in Kelly's base 3-4
defense is formidable nose tack-
le Louis Nix III, who consistent-
ly disrupts runs up the middle,
or at the very least draws double
teams that free up space for
the ends and linebackers. And
the linebacker corps is led by
presumed 2013 NFL draft first-
rounder Manti Te'o, whose run
defense is among the best in the
country.
Te'o led the Irish defense in
tackles in both the 2010 and 2011
matchups.
"Te'o's an excellent player,"
said offensive coordinator Al
Borges. "(He's) very active,
always around the ball. Their
front is similar (to Alabama's)
in that they're both three-man
fronts, eat up a lot of gaps inside,
try to make it tough for you to
run the ball inside the tackles -
so they're similar that way. Both
of them are physical fronts that
run well and, you know, will
cause us problems if we don't
take care of business."
Behind the front seven,
though, Notre Dame's secondary

isn't very strong, and Robinson
may be more inclined to stay in
the pocket and pass than he was
in the teams' past two meetings.
The Fighting Irish secondary
features a true freshman and a
wide receiver transplant, and
starting safety Jamoris Slaugh-
ter went down with a ruptured
Achilles' tendon against Michi-
gan State last week and is out for
the season.
The Spartans lack significant
vertical threats, meaning the
inexperienced Notre Dame sec-
ondary has yet to be tested.
"I feel like, through the film,
their DBs don't look half bad to
me," said junior wide receiver
Devin Gardner. "I don't see
where people get that from. The
front seven is really good, and
the DBs are really good, from
what I can see."
On the other side of the ball,
Kelly has a new weapon this
year in sophomore quarterback
Everett Golson, who has gotten
the nod as Notre Dame's starter.
The signal caller is a dual threat,
so the Wolverines will have to be
wary of him breaking out of the
pocket.

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daly
:onsecutive years against Notre Dame.
The inexperienced Wolver-
ine defensive line hasn't turned
many heads so far this season,
but it may be able to get a solid
push against a relatively week
Notre Dame offensive line. So
far this season, Golson has had
happy feet, but unfortunately for
opponents, scrambling has been
a strength for him.
Michigan may also have a
tough time matching up with
star tight end Tyler Eifert,
who's featured heavily in Kelly's
offense.
The 6-foot-6, 250-pounder is
a very reliable safety blanket for
Golson, and he'll be able to catch
passes over undersized Michi-
gan defenders.
Ultimately, though, the Notre
Dame offense is one that Michi-
gan has seen before.
"It's still the same," said
defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison. "It's the head coach -
he's still going to run his thing
and their philosophy and that's
what they've done. The thing
that maybe changes a little bit
is he has the ability to scramble
(with Golson) if something isn't
there."

After two weeks of play-
ing against subpar opponents
- though Air Force certainly
didn't play like one - the No. 18
Michigan football team returns
to stiffer competition this week
with a primetime tilt against
Notre Dame on the road.
And if recent trends hold true,
it should be a barnburner. Each
of the last three games in this
series have come down to the
final minute, with the Wolver-
ines successfully leading last-
ditch drives each time to come
away with the win.
Senior quarterback Denard
Robinson has been the story
for the last two seasons, single-
handedly acting as the Fighting
Irish's bane with back-to-back
dominant efforts. But Robinson
and his teammates appear to
have a more formidable oppo-
nent this time around - No.
11 Notre Dame is off to its best
start since 2002 - and they will
square off under the lights for
the second straight year.
Michigan rush offense vs.
Notre Dame rush defense
Bad news for the Wolverines:
they've still yet to get a domi-
nant effort from their running
backs. (Last week's mutilation
of Massachusetts doesn't real-
ly count.) They need redshirt
junior running back Fitzgerald
Toussaint to return to his 2011
form, when he became one of
the conference's better run-
ners. He'll be hungry to perform
against Notre Dame after miss-
ing the matchup last season with
a shoulder injury.
Worse news for Michigan:
the Fighting Irish front seven is
as effective as its been in recent
memory. At 326 pounds, Louis
Nix is a strong anchor at nose
tackle, and Manti Teo is one of
the best middle linebackers in
the country.
In the past two weeks, the
Fighting Irish held Purdue to
just 90 rush yards and Michigan
State to 50 yards on the ground.
Notre Dame also did a solid job
last year against Michigan, hold-
ing the Wolverines to a 4.4 yards
per carry.
The X-factor, of course, is
Robinson. But like Alabama,
Notre Dame will likely do its
bestto force Robinson to beatthe
Fighting Irish through the air.
They should be well-equipped to
stymie his ground game.
Edge: Notre Dame
Michigan pass offense vs.
Notre Dame pass defense
This might be the biggest
mismatch of the game - which
might come as a surprise, since
most observers don't see Robin-
son's arm as a strength.
But the Deerfield Beach, Fla.
native has shown much better
accuracy and decision-making
so far this season. The receiv-
ing corps, which was a question
mark going into the year, has
been solidified thanks to quar-
terback Devin Gardner's posi-
tion switch and the emergence
of freshman tight end Devin
Funchess. Their athleticism
makes them mismatches for
opposing defenses and big tar-
gets for Robinson.
More importantly for Michi-
gan, the Notre Dame second-

ary is in rough shape. Safety
Zeke Motta returns from last
season, but fellow safety Jamo-
ris Slaughter ruptured his Achil-
les' tendon last week against
Michigan State and is out for
the season. Starting cornerback
Lo Wood is also out for the year
after injuring himself during fall
camp.
Their replacements - Mat-
thias Farley and KeiVarae Rus-
sell - are both inexperienced,
former wide receivers. The unit
hasn't been bad this season, but
it will still be plenty vulnerable.
Robinson should be ready to
exploit it, though he'll have to
watch out for Notre Dame's Ste-

Notre Dame rush offense vs.
Michigan rush defense
The Fighting Irish have a
hydra of sorts at running back.
Former receiver Theo Riddick
and George Atkinson III split
snaps with Cierre Wood, who'll
be playing in his second game
after serving a two-game sus-
pension at the start of the season.
While the team's rushing
attack hasn't been great this
season, Wood's addition helps
matters. (He had 60 yards on 10
carries against Michigan State).
And plenty of questions sur-
round Michigan's front seven.
True freshmen James Ross and
Joe Bolden are talented, but their
extensive playing time raises
questions about the reliability of
fifth-year senior Kenny Demens
and health of sophomore Des-
mond Morgan.
Additionally,nobody on the
defensive line has done much to
distinguish himself for the Wol-
verines.
With a veteran offensive line
operating for Notre Dame, this
is the matchup that could decide
the game.
Edge: Notre Dame
Notre Dame pass offense vs.
Michigan pass defense
The Wolverine back seven
is probably disappointed to see
Notre Dame quarterback Tommy
Rees on the bench, given how
many mistakes he made against
them the past two seasons.
Instead, Michigan will square
off with Everett Golson. The
redshirt freshman is a much
better fit for Notre Dame coach
Brian Kelly's spread offense
because of his athleticism, but
Golson is by no means a star
yet. He's completed nearly 60
percent of his passes and in pri-
metime captured the national
spotlight against Michigan State
last week.
While star receiver Michael
Floyd is gone, Golson has a solid
threat to throw to in T.J. Jones,
and Tyler Eifert is one of the best
tight ends in the country. Though
he hasn't done it much so far, the
quarterback is always a threat
to take off and run, meaning the
Wolverines will have, to keep a
careful eye on him.
The jury is still out on the
Michigan secondary, which
hasn't really been tested since
the first game against Alabama.
Junior Courtney Avery and
sophomore Raymon Taylor will
have to play big in sophomore
cornerback Blake Countess' con-
tinued absence.
Edge: Push
Special teams
Both teams have solid kick-
ers. Notre Dame's Kyle Brindza
is 4-for-5 on field goals, while
redshirt junior Brendan Gib-
bons has made his lone attempt
for Michigan. Neither team has
gamebreakers in the punt return
game.
Give the Wolverines the slight
nod in this category for two
reasons: freshman Dennis Nor-
fleet seems poised for a big kick
return, and junior punter Will
Hagerup has been booming his
punts this season, with an aver-
age of 48.5 yards, though he's
often outkicked his coverage.

Edge: Michigan
Intangibles
While the Wolverines have
Robinson and his ability to oblit-
erate the hopes and dreams of
Notre Dame fans, the Fighting
Irish have a lot more going for
them in this one. They're playing
at home at night, which is always
a big advantage, and they're the
more confident team. In fact,
spirits haven't been this high in
South Bend for a while now.
Edge: Notre Dame ,
