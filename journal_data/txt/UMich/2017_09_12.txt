Imagine a world in which 

new careers and those that 
are unheard of today, exist, 
and those careers that exist 
today are no longer available. 
A world where robots have 
complete control of certain 
occupations, 
and 
where 

humans have the opportunity 
to implant knowledge into 
their brains through the use of 
technological advancements.

On Monday evening, Dr. 

Kevin LaGrandeur, a professor 
of English at the New York 
Institute 
of 
Technology, 

addressed these possibilities 
to a crowd of about 100 
students, 
faculty 
and 

community members as part 
of the Science, Technology 
and Public Policy Lecture 
Series. 

LaGrandeur, 
along 
with 

James 
J. 
Hughes, 
wrote 

“Surviving the Machine Age: 
Intelligent Technology and 
the Transformation of Human 
Work,” a book describing how 
an increase in technology 
may 
influence 
employment 

in future years. These spurts 
of technology advancement 
are 
not 
new 
to 
society, 

LaGrandeur 
explained. 
In 

the 1960s, the automobile 
industry underwent a change 
in which industrial robots 
began displacing workers.

“Now 
this 
process 
is 

affecting jobs in a much 

broader way, not just in the 
working classes, but even in 
the middle and upper-middle 
classes,” 
LaGrandeur 
said. 

“This process in technological 
displacement is accelerating.”

Among the most notable of 

displacements include a farm 
in Japan completely managed 
by robots, an Australian robot 
with the capability of laying 
bricks at about 20 times 
faster than a human in the 

construction industry, bionic 
bartenders on several Royal 
Caribbean cruise ships and a 
restaurant in Japan capable of 
quickly making ramen dishes 
for customers.

LaGrandeur continued by 

showing audience members 
a 
chart 
displaying 
the 

probabilities of robots taking 
over certain careers in the 
next 20 years. The four careers 
with the highest probabilities 

included telemarketers, with 
a 99 percent chance of being 
replaced, 
accountant 
and 

auditors at 94 percent, retail 
salesperson with 92 percent 
and technical writers at 89 
percent. He also described 
the more recent virtual reality 
real estate tours, in which 
prospective buyers can look 
through 3D glasses at real 
estate, even at buildings that 

At its first meeting of the 

academic 
year, 
the 
Senate 

Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University 
Affairs 
passed 
a 

resolution condemning the recent 
anti-Latino 
graffiti 
incident, 

when hate messages were spray 
painted on the Rock, a campus 
landmark at the intersection 
of Hill Street and Washtenaw 
Avenue on Aug. 31.

The 
resolution 
— 
which 

passed by a narrow 4-7 margin 
— states SACUA’s support for 
Latino 
community 
members, 

their devotion to the equity 
and 
inclusion 
of 
all 
ethnic 

communities, 
and 
denounced 

any acts of hate or messages 
targeting any ethnic or national 
community.

However, 
despite 
their 

unanimous 
condemnation 
of 

the bias incident, the members 
of SACUA were split over the 
language of the resolution.

In a debate among SACUA 

members about the wording of 
the resolution, Michael Atzmon, a

It’s been quite a month 

for Kid Rock. The rock star 
and 
Michigan 
native 
has 

become embroiled in a slew 
of controversies lately, as he 
has been criticized as the 
opening-night choice for the 
Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, 
Michigan 
and 
accused 
of 

violating campaign law.

The singer released an official 

statement on his Facebook page 
Monday morning to address his 
adversaries.

“People! Pay NO attention 

to the garbage the extreme left 
is trying to create! (and by the 
way, f—- the extreme left and 
the extreme right!),” Kid Rock, 
whose real name is Robert 
Ritchie, wrote on Facebook.

Controversy 
arose 
when 

Sam Riddle, political director 
of 
the 
Michigan 
National 

Action 
Network, 
criticized 

the Red Wings in an interview 
with the Detroit Free Press 
for

white 

supremacy group who paraded

LGBTQ-focused student groups provide community

DESIGN BY AVA WEINER

The organizations aim to promote welcoming environment, provide networking opportunities, resources across disciplines 

LGBTQ-focused student groups 

on campus aim to foster welcoming 
communities 
and 
enhance 

professional 
opportunities 
for 

LGBTQ individuals and allies, 
at several of the University of 
Michigan’s schools and colleges.

Out in Science, Technology, 

Engineering 
and 
Mathematics, 

Out for Business, and Outlaws are 
just three of the organizations with 
such missions.

oSTEM

New York Times columnist 

Manil Suri once asked, “Why is 

science so straight?” He wrote 
while the statistics are difficult to 
find, an analysis by Rice University 
says the government-STEM field 
has 20 percent fewer LGBTQ 
workers than should be expected. 
Another study, in 2015, shows 43 
percent of LGBTQ workers in the 
field are in the closet. Suri theorizes 
it could be because the culture of 
STEM suggests personal identity 
could interfere with neutrality.

Engineering senior Caity Hines 

is on the executive board of oSTEM 
and President of Society of Women 
Engineers— an organization meant 
for LGBTQ students in STEM 
fields; she works in event planning 
and serves as a liaison between 
the group and other campus 

organizations, as well as with the 
administration.

The organization is registered 

through 
the 
College 
of 

Engineering, though it is open to 
people in STEM fields and beyond; 
it is also part of a national oSTEM 
organization.

Hines said the group has 

a 
positive 
relationship 
with 

the Spectrum Center and the 
administration, especially as a 
result of an effort by the Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion initiative to 
“hear all voices” on campus. 

“I’ve had administrators ask 

specifically if somebody from 
oSTEM was going to be present 
at different meetings with other 
student organizations,” she said.

Hines explained how within the 

College of Engineering there are 
DEI-focused meetings that include 
oSTEM and other identity-based 
organizations. 
She 
specifically 

noted a meeting that occurred the 
day after racist and anti-Semitic 
emails were sent to University 
engineering and computer science 
students.

Though not directly affecting 

the LGBTQ community, the email 
incident, Hines said, was addressed 
in an oSTEM meeting; she noted 
an intersectionality of identities in 
the group.

“There has not been a lot of 

direct homophobia; it’s a lot more 
indirect — just attitudes — and 
then we have a fair number of 

students of color in the org,” she 
said. “Last year the majority of our 
board was students of color. So the 
intersectionality … has played into 
our activity.”

Currently, Hines said, there are 

30 to 40 active members, which 
she noted is to be expected seeing 
as there are not a lot of people 
in STEM fields who are openly 
LGBTQ; however, she added low 
numbers can be difficult when 
trying to organize events.

Engineering sophomore Jaim 

Befeler is a student from Costa Rica 
and member of the organization. 
He 
said 
the 
organization 
is 

important to him because in Costa 
Rica it is hard to be out and in the 
science field, and added Costa Rica 

is a very conservative country. He 
learned of oSTEM at the annual 
Pride Outside event when he was a 
freshman.

“Coming here and being able 

to have people understand me not 
only for my identity, also for what I 
love doing, it was really supportive 
and it … made me feel like I am not 
alone,” he said.

Befeler, 
who 
is 
studying 

computer engineering, noted one 
feature of the organization that 
has been an asset to him is the 
academic support.

“It was really, really nice when 

I started coming to the meetings 
and having discussions and having 
people that told me, ‘If you need 
help in your class I can help,’ or

Excited to be back @

during bicentennial year 
celebrations @UMich. I owe 
everything to that place. 

The House of Representatives 

unanimously 
passed 
a 
bill 

that will pave the way for 
advancements 
in 
self-driving 

automobile 
technology. 
The 

bill, titled the “Safely Ensuring 
Lives Future Deployment and 
Research in Vehicle Evolution 
Act” or the “SELF DRIVE Act,” 
was supported by Rep. Debbie 
Dingell, D-Mich. and sponsored 
by Rep. Robert Latta, R-Ohio.

The SELF DRIVE Act aims 

to advance safety by prioritizing 
the protection of consumers and 
reaffirming the role of federal 
and state governments in the 
future self-driving technology. 
The 
Energy 
and 
Commerce 

Committee’s website read the 
legislation 
will 
“update 
the 

federal motor vehicle safety 

standards to account for advances 
in technology and the evolution 
of highly automated vehicles” 
and 
“maximize 
opportunities 

for research and development 
here in the U.S. to create jobs and 
grow economic opportunities so 
that America can remain a global 
leader in this industry.”

In a press release, Dingell said 

she believes the bill brings many 
benefits to the United States.

“Today, with passage of the 

SELF DRIVE Act, we are one 
step closer to reshaping American 
innovation for generations to 
come,” Dingell said. “Automated 
vehicles 
have 
the 
potential 

to transform mobility in this 
country – reducing congestion 
on our roads, providing greater 
independence to seniors and 
those 
with 
disabilities 
and 

helping to prevent the 35,000 
deaths on our roadways each 
year.”

Business sophomore Bethany 

Zalewski 
is 
involved 
with 

research in driver behavior and 
trust with autonomous vehicles. 
She shared her hopes for the 
legislation’s impact in the real 
world.

“This could reduce distracted 

driving, drunk driving or texting 
and driving,” Zalewski said. “The 
University of Michigan and Mcity 
are definitely playing a big role 
in developing these self-driving 
cars.”

The SELF DRIVE Act has 

important implications for the 
University’s campus, such as 
research institute Mcity. 

Director of Mcity Huei Peng 

believes the SELF DRIVE Act 
is important for the research 
institute.

“Many of the laws in the past 

were developed based on the 
belief that the vehicle is driven 
by a human operator, but as we 
are developing new technology 
and some of the language used 

in these rules may no longer 
apply,” Peng said. “I think 
for the research community 
that is working on automated 
vehicles, certainty this is a 
very important, positive step 
forward.”

According to Peng, there 

are three levels of autonomous 
vehicles: Guardian, which acts 
as a last resort for safety in case 
a driver is distracted; Co-pilot, 
which features cruise control 
and a constant safe distance 
between cars; and Chauffeur, 
which is a completely driverless 
vehicle.

The benefits of self-driving 

cars are numerous. According 
to a study from the Eno 
Center 
for 
Transportation, 

if 90 percent of cars were 
autonomous, as many as 21,700 
lives could be saved per year in 
addition to the $447 billion in 
economic benefits.

“Safety 
is 
number 
one, 

because today there is plenty of 
evidence that today’s drivers are 
getting more distracted: people 
keep talking on their phones, 

Houses passes bill paving way for 
increases in self-driving car tech

The legislation brings many benefits to autonomous vehicle research and industry

It seems that last Saturday’s 

football game will go down as 
pre-historic.

Fans watched in awe at 

halftime as the Michigan 
Marching Band was accompanied 
by a pack of people in 
Tyrannosaurus rex costumes, 
dancing to the band’s rendition 
of the theme song from “Jurassic 
Park.”

The dancing dinos were 

part of a larger show from the 
marching band, where they 
debuted the new college band 
master series from composers 
John Williams and Hal Leonard. 
In addition to the “Jurassic Park” 
theme song, the series includes 
the main title from “Star Wars” 
and “Adventures on Earth” from 
the finale of “E.T.”

Fans loved it, some hailing it 

as one of the best halftime shows 
they’d ever seen.

The band was proud of their 

performance as well. According 
to Engineering sophomore Jack 
Teener, they practiced for about 
two weeks to get the dance just 
right, but only had one full dress 
rehearsal with the T-rex dancers 
in costume. The band knows 
its set a high bar for itself, but 
Teener is optimistic the rest of 
the season will be just as great.

“One thing that was kind of 

different about that show is that 
we had a lot more time to put 
it all together,” he said. “But I 
think it’s always gonna be great.”

The show gained national 

attention, and news outlets 
such as ESPN and USAToday 
published videos of the T-rex 
portion of it on their websites.

Michigan fan Janine Kerr 

summed it up with her tweet on 
Saturday.

MATT VAILLIENCOURT/Daily

Members of University ROTC groups stand around the American flag in remembrance of the 9/11 terrorist 
attacks 17 years ago on the Diag Monday.

IN MEMORIAM

‘Don’t worry, I’ve been through that, it’s 
going to be fine;’ it was a sense of relief, so 
it was really, really nice for me,” he said.

LSA sophomore Allie Batka is studying 

chemistry and is also a member of the 
organization; 
she 
echoed 
Befeler’s 

comment, saying she likes having role 
models who can relate to her experiences.

“For me, it was also important to have 

role models who are also queer and in 
STEM — the upperclassmen, the board 
leaders and also the graduate students in 
the program,” she said. “For me, I found 
out about oSTEM before freshman year 
actually, because I had asked around about 
LGBTQ+ orgs on campus and somebody 
mentioned oSTEM and it sounded perfect 
for me, because I’m studying chemistry 
and I’m queer.”

Batka said she has made a lot of friends 

in the organization. She said she has also 
tried to bring friends from outside the 
group to oSTEM meetings.

In terms of collaboration, the group 

coordinates several events with other 
student organizations, such as Out for 
Business, Outlaws and Out in Public, 
as well as with other identity-based 
engineering organizations, such as Society 
of Hispanic Professional Engineers and 
the National Society of Black Engineers. 

In addition to the annual Pride Outside 

event, which took place last week, 
oSTEM and many other LGBTQ groups 
participate in the Autumn Pride and 
Winter Pride events — mixers for anyone 
who identifies as queer, including staff, 
faculty and alumni. Additionally, there are 
networking dinners in the fall and winter 
terms, at which representatives from big 
companies like Google and Microsoft — 
most of whom identify as LGBTQ — come 
to the University to meet with students 
and discuss internships, their jobs, and 
the environment at their companies.

Outlaws

Second year law student Joel Richert 

is the co-chair of Outlaws, the LGBTQ 
affinity group in the Law School. The 
group 
engages 
in 
mentorship 
and 

outreach with incoming law students and 
those on campus; it also partners with 
firms to give law students a sense of what 
it is like to be openly LGBTQ in the field of 
law and similar professions.

“LGBTQ+ — while there is more 

visibility than there was 10 years ago or 
20 years ago — it’s still sort of a diversity 
position to be gay and to be out in law,” 
Richert said.

The group hosts a weekly pro bono 

clinic in Ann Arbor, as well as a Know 
Your Rights project for transgender 
outreach, name-change clinics, as well 
as general legal services and advice for 
queer, nongender binary individuals.

According to Richert, the group’s email 

list has about 180 people; Richert noted 
not all of them are LGBTQ-identifying.

Richert said the administration at 

the Law School works with Outlaws to 
do recruiting for the Law School, and 
provides the organization a lot of support. 
He said recently two of the organization’s 

administrators from the Admissions 
Office and Office of Student Life at the 
Law School left to take other positions. 
Currently, the organization is working 
with the administration to select someone 
to take over those positions; Richert 
said the administration has been great 
about including Outlaws members in the 
interview process.

“The administration works with a lot 

with affinity groups to make sure the 
campus is diverse and that we’re having 
visibility in the Law School,” he said.

Richert said the organization does 

not do much work with the wider 
University administration, as the Law 
School is somewhat secluded, though 
it does collaborate with other LGBTQ 
organizations like oSTEM and Graduates 
Out in Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Mathematics.

“One of the things we want to work 

on this year is becoming more integrated 
with the larger University community,” 
he said.

He said it would be nice to have a little 

more contact with the other graduate-
level programs on campus; however, he 
noted the Law School is such an intense 
experience that it makes sense to have a 
more confined group.

Richert 
said 
the 
organization 

maintains positive relations with the 
student body in that many of its events are 
offered to all students.

“I think both the student body and 

the Law School and the faculty have 
been really great, and they definitely 
see Outlaws and LGBTQ+ diversity at 
the Law School as central to the mission 
of the administration and the school’s 
mission,” he said.

Out for Business

Out for Business serves as the LGBTQ 

student association at the Ross School of 
Business. Rackham student Sean Pavlik, 
who is pursuing an MBA at the Business 
School and an MS degree at the School for 
Environment and Sustainability, is on the 
leadership board of the organization.

The organization operates at the 

graduate and undergraduate level to 
foster 
understanding, 
professional 

development and advocacy of LGBTQ 
issues for the business community, 
according to Pavlik.

Pavlik 
said 
the 
organization’s 

membership consists of more than 100 
LGBTQ-identifying people as well as 
allies who do not fall under the LGBTQ 
category but are still supportive of the 
community.

“Some of the items are specifically 

geared toward our LGBTQ+ members 
such as professional development and 
recruiting efforts, considering it’s a 
professional degree program, but a large 
component of what we do is engaging that 
larger community — understanding that 
the LGBTQ+ population at any school, but 
of course at Ross, as well, is a relatively 
small percentage,” he said. “We view our 
mission as not just supporting dialogue 
and community for that smaller group but 
for the larger Ross community as well.”

Pavlik said the group also has DEI 

staff at the Business School with whom 
they work to put together ally training as 

part of National Coming Out Week; they 
organize an event where they focus on 
coming out stories, at which students tell 
of the time they identified themselves as 
LGBTQ to their families or friends.

Pavlik said the group has a positive 

relationship with the administration at 
the Business School, and seeks to engage 
the DEI chair at the Business School in 
the coming year to educate the larger 
Business School community on its work.

Pavlik said he couldn’t recall a negative 

incident of negativity that the group 
had to address within the University 
community; he said he is proud of Out 
for Business for standing with groups on 
campus that may be targeted, as a result 
of diversity issues.

Pavlik said he thinks the organization 

provides an important network.

“I found that being involved in clubs 

such as Out for Business has been a really 
great way to develop those connections, 
both for friendship and community, as 
well as professionally, and understanding 
some 
of 
those 
opportunities 
and 

learning from each (other’s) professional 
experiences, thinking about being a 
graduate 
professional-level 
program, 

that’s definitely part of the club,” he said.

Pavlik said one aspect of the group, 

being affiliated with the Business School 
is that it participates in a national LGBTQ 
conference, called Reaching Out MBA.

“That’s 
a 
great 
professional 

opportunity for members of the LGBTQ+ 
MBA community to come together and 
network with companies and understand 
more what it’s like to be an out professional 
in the business world,” he said.

Noting the LGBTQ community may 

be considered a minority group in the 
business world, Pavlik said visibility is 
extremely important. He said the number 
of open LGBTQ CEOs is very small. 
Pavlik said the group strives for visibility, 
seeing as most individuals in the Business 
School do not identify as LGBT; he added 
it is important for allies of the LGBT 
community to understand the complexity 
of navigating the business environment 
for LGBT-identifying people.

In 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook became 

the first openly gay CEO at Fortune 
500 company. In a 2016 list of the most 
powerful LGBT executives in the world 
from Business Insider, Gigi Chao — vice 
chairman of Cheuk Nang Holdings, a 
property management company in Hong 
Kong — topped the list. Also on the list was 
Stacey Friedman, general counsel at JP 
Morgan Chase; in 2016, she won a case to 
overturn a ban on gay adoption. Jonathan 
Mildenhall — the chief marketing officer 
at Airbnb — made the list as well.

In the past five years, Pavlik said Out 

for Business has seen a lot of growth in 
membership and activity, especially as a 
result of increased engagement in the BBA 
community; Pavlik said undergraduate 
students at the Business School have 
reached out to bring the group to the 
undergrad level.

“(We’re) just seeing a lot of growth in 

visibility and support in the past several 
years at Ross,” he said. “I’m definitely 
proud to be a Ross student and proud of 
the support that our group receives and 
the role our group plays on campus.”

do not yet exist.

One of the main causes 

of 
these 
transformations, 

LaGrandeur 
explained, 

involves humans’ inability to 
work as quickly or as cheaply 
as robots. A sort of repeat of the 
events of the Gilded Age, those 
with low wage jobs are at the 
highest risk.

“In 
terms 
of 
sheer 

productivity, humans can’t keep 
up with computers and robots, 
and even when they can, all 
things being equal, machines 
and digital implements are 
often more convenient and 
cheaper,” he said.

Although long-term issues 

do arise, LaGrandeur stated 
the short-term concerns facing 
the 
human 
workforce 
will 

require the most attention. 
Potential solutions featured in 

“Surviving the Machine Age” 
include a better education on 
jobs robots cannot complete, 
shortening 
the 
workweek 

to 30 hours, having a basic 
income guarantee, instituting 
micro-fees to compensate for 
micro-incomes, implementing 
a 
tax 
for 
businesses 
that 

make 
use 
of 
robots 
and 

developing technology for the 
economically disadvantaged.

Casey Pierce, an assistant 

professor in the School of 
Information, 
commentated 

on the event and explained 
her thoughts of the issue 
specifically 
in 
terms 
of 

health 
care. 
She 
described 

the possibility of replacing 
in-office eye exams with those 
taken on a smartphone, and the 
effects these exams might have 
on patients.

“I asked my optometrist last 

week his thoughts on this, kind 
of knowing what his response 
was going to be, and he told me 

it was the most ridiculous thing 
that I could ever think about 
doing when I really just needed 
to get a new prescription for a 
new box of contacts,” she said.

She 
also 
discussed 
her 

own work in regard to new 
technological 
advancements, 

and questioned those that could 
replace tasks she has such as 
grading papers.

“What does my occupation 

as a professor mean when I’m 
delegating some of my work to 
technology?” she asked.

Yu-Ming Chen, a master’s 

student 
in 
the 
College 
of 

Engineering, attended the talk 
as part of Michigan Robotics to 
learn more about the issue from 
a public policy aspect.

“Everybody’s not sure about 

what the future is going to be,” 
he said. “I’m surprised that 
there’s some technology that 
can implant knowledge into 
your brain and you can learn it 
very quickly.”

to use Confederate flags in his 
performances, as the first performer 
to play at their new arena.

“So the Red Wings will open their 

new arena in Detroit next month 
with Kid Rock, a known lover of the 
Confederate Flag, a hate symbol; now 
the Wings wonder why and object to 
white supremacists using the Wings 
logo?” Riddle said.

A second issue involves Ritchie’s 

anticipated 
run 
for 
US 
Senate, 

which he has has been talking about 
since early July, when he launched 
a website devoted to his candidacy. 
Although the site sells merchandise 
emblazoned with campaign slogans 
and “Kid Rock ‘18 For US Senate,” 
Ritchie has not yet formally declared 
his candidacy.

Scandal broke earlier this month 

after non-partisan watchdog group 
Common Cause filed a complaint with 
the Federal Election Commission, 
claiming that Kid Rock had broken 
the law by acting as a Senate candidate 
without registering as one.

Ritchie took to Facebook to respond 

to these criticisms.

“Pretty funny how scared I have 

them all and their only agenda is to 
try and label people / me racist who 
do not agree or cower to them!!” 
Ritchie wrote. “No one had a word 
to say when we sold out the 6 shows 
at LCA back in January! My track 
record in Detroit and Michigan 
speaks for itself, and I would dare 
anyone talking trash to put theirs up 
against mine. I am also a homeowner 

and taxpayer in the city of Detroit, 
so suck on that too. I am the bonified 
(sic) KING OF DETROIT LOVE and it 
makes me smile down deep that you 
haters know that! Your jealousy is 
merely a reflection of disgust for your 
own failures and lack of positive ideas 
for our city.”

There was no explicit mention of 

his Senate run or its surrounding 
controversy in the statement, though 
people did not shy away from it in the 
comments section.

“I’m not in Michigan so I can’t 

vote for you, but I stand with you & 
support you 100%! #KidRock4Senate 
You are a true, blue American, you 
love this country, you love your 
city, you love your state and you are 
FOR the people! Keep doin’ you, 
boo! 
#KidRockNation,” 
one 
fan 

commented. 

Ritchie, whose Little Caesars Arena 

shows begin Tuesday night, decided 
to end his post on a positive note.

“There is so much to be thankful 

for and so many positive things going 
on in and around our city / state that 
we need not let these handful of jerks 
sway that in any way,” he wrote. “I 
know I should probably not even have 
posted anything about these bottom 
feeders but I will always stand up 
for myself, my family, my friends, my 
fans, my city, my state, my country 
and the good in human nature!”

He then finished off the statement 

with an emphatic post-script, in 
referencing to allegations that Kid 
Rock was offending Black Americans 
and Black culture with his support of 
the Confederate flag.

“P.P.P.P.P.S. 
I 
LOVE 
BLACK 

PEOPLE!!”

texting and checking things,” 
Peng said. “The beauty of robots is 
that they are very consistent; they 
don’t get distracted and won’t 
have road rage.”

Lives aren’t the only thing 

saved with more autonomous 
vehicles on the road; the economic 
and social benefits of these 
vehicles have potential to make 
a significant difference in the 
nation’s economy. In 2014, the 
U.S. spent about $871 billion a 
year in economic loss and due 
to automobile accidents, with 
$277 billion being allocated for 
economic costs and $594 billion 
attributed to the “loss of life and 
the pain and decreased quality of 
life because of injuries.”

LSA senior Enrique Zalamea, 

president 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of College Republicans, 
said the SELF DRIVE Act could 

positively benefit the country.

“The U.S. spends so much 

money on car crashes in terms of 
the property damage of highways, 
insurance and health care as well; 
the total social costs is around 
$800 billion,” Zalamea said. “Self-
driving cars would be incredibly 
beneficial to the economy, because 
of their cost-saving benefits to the 
government who spends so much 
money.”

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel, 
communications 

director of the University’s chapter 
of College Democrats, who is also 
a columnist for the Daily, also 
said she endorses the benefits of 
autonomous vehicles.

“I’m happy to see a bipartisan 

commitment 
to 
monitor 
and 

improve advanced technology,” 
Schandevel wrote. “If all goes well, 
this technology will hopefully 
make the city safer.”

Dingell said the legislation also 

seeks to make transportation more 
accessible for the elderly and the 

disabled, two groups of people 
whose needs are sometimes unmet 
due to unavailability or high costs 
of adequate transportation.

A driverless shuttle service will 

be a feature of North Campus. 
Automated pizza delivery cars have 
also found their way into the Mcity 
Test Facility, and 1,500 vehicles 
have 
been 
deployed 
through 

connected infrastructure in Ann 
Arbor with the hope of studying 
the 
impact 
these 
connected 

technologies have on congestion 
and pedestrian safety.

Zalamea 
mentioned 
how 

he thinks University students 
could directly benefit from more 
autonomous vehicles being on the 
road.

“I think this would be a big 

benefit for students, especially with 
making shuttles more efficient,” 
Zalamea said. “As a freshman, I 
remember always waiting for the 
Bursley-Baits bus at night, and I 
think autonomous shuttles could 
make this more efficient.”

SELF DRIVING

voted 
against 
the 
resolution, 

emphasized 
the 
importance 

of sending a broad message to 
include all ethnic communities.

“Discrimination takes many 

forms, 
so 
(the 
resolution) 

shouldn’t be narrow,” Atzmon 
said.

A counterpoint came from Dave 

Wright, SACUA senate assembly 
member and associate professor 
of accounting, saying that the 
statement should be left as was 
presented Monday evening.

“I actually like this one better 

the way it stands,” Wright said. 

“I think it’s tighter, more direct 
to the event that happened on 
August 31st.”

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, 
who 
attended 
the 

meeting, 
discussed 
how 
to 

motivate students to see each 
other as one community rather 
than 
their 
specific 
identities 

when these events occur. He 
also asked SACUA members for 
advice on how to best reach out 
to the student body in response to 
similar incidents.

“It feels like I only reach out to 

(students) when there is a crisis,” 
Schlissel 
said. 
“I’m 
thinking 

about ways to truly purposefully 
promote conversation about these 
issues in the absence of an inciting 

event so that we can promote a 
shared sense of responsibility for 
how to react when something bad 
does happen. I haven’t done an 
adequate job at this.”

Schlissel also discussed the 

University’s policy on sexual 
misconduct 
and 
its 
plan 
to 

keep the current policy with no 
changes.

“There is no reason to alter 

our policy because we think it 
is a stable policy,” Schlissel said. 
“We’d like to keep things in place 
for a few years, two to three years, 
and gain experience with it and 
criticism of it and then modify it 
based on this experience.”

Schlissel highlighted a part 

of this policy, which offers a 

mechanism for those accused 
of sexual misconduct to appeal. 
According to Schlissel, this step 
requires all evidence on file of a 
sexual misconduct incident be 
sent to a retired federal judge.

Schlissel also emphasized the 

importance of a fair and balanced 
disciplinary process. He assured 
that the University’s Title IX 
officers have the utmost training 
on 
the 
University’s 
policies 

surrounding sexual misconduct 
to ensure due process of these 
incidents.

“The ultimate solution will 

not come from us around the 
table … it has to come from the 
next 
generation 
of 
students 

themselves,” Schlissel said. “It 

has to be a social enforcement 
of a set of standards and mutual 
respect in how people treat each 
other … I think that has the best 
chance of really turning (sexual 
misconduct) around.”

In the final portion of the 

meeting, 
SACUA 
members 

unanimously voted to reinstate 
the Tri-Campus Task Force — a 
faculty board of representatives 
from all three University campuses 
with an aim of improving faculty 
governance structures at the Flint 
and Dearborn campuses — for 
another academic year.

Mechanical 
engineering 

professor William Schultz, SACUA 
senate assembly immediate past 
chair, raised concerns about the 

task force not meeting regularly. 
He further proposed the motion 
to reinstate the Tri-Campus Task 
Force for another year.

“My concern is that the Tri-

Campus Task Force did not meet 
regularly, so I am asking for it to 
be reconstituted with only faculty 
assembly members so that it can 
meet at least briefly before or after 
assembly meetings,” Schultz said.

According to Robert Ortega, 

SACUA senate assembly chair 
and associate professor of social 
work, 
two 
faculty 
assembly 

representatives from each of the 
three campuses will form a task 
force of six members and will be 
required to meet either before or 
after every assembly.

A 

recent article in The 
Atlantic is titled, “Why 
Won’t Trump Call Out 

Radical White Terrorism?” 
Another from Fortune states, 
“The 
Charlottesville 
Car 

Attack Was Terrorism. It’s 
Dangerous to Call It Anything 
Else.” Even Jeff Sessions said, 
“It (Charlottesville) does meet 
the definition of domestic 
terrorism in our statute.” 

Repeatedly over the week 

after 
the 
Charlottesville 

attack, 
where 
white 

supremacists came to protest 
the removal of a Confederate 
statue that eventually led 
to violence, Republican and 
Democratic politicians were 
quick to condemn the “both 
sides” narrative by President 
Donald Trump during his 
press conference. Some minds 
were especially angry that he 
couldn’t condemn domestic 
terrorism. 
Across 
the 

spectrum, these attacks were 
seen as terrorism, but most 
were baffled by the fact that 
others were unable to condemn 
the acts immediately. Even 
among those who eventually 
did see James Alex Fields 
Jr. drive into the crowd of 
counterprotesters, it still took 
even longer to realize that in 
fact, this was an act of terror.

Domestic 
terrorism 
isn’t 

new. It occurred early in our 
nation’s history, and even 
as recently as Aug. 6, when 
writer Wajahat Ali tweeted: 
“A Minnesota mosque was 
bombed. That’s terrorism. You 
won’t see it on the headline 
news. 
It’s 
not 
trending. 

Wonder why.” This lack of a 
clear definition of terrorism is 
more common than we might 
think, but instead of being 
dumbfounded and irate on this 
lack of action against domestic 
terrorism in Charlottesville, 
I stepped back and began to 
ask questions. Moreover, I 
asked why we struggle with 
defining domestic terrorism, 
be it perpetuated by white 
supremacy 
or 
other 
hate 

groups. In my introspection, 
I found issues of legal debate. 
But more importantly, I think 
that there is a nuance that 
we seem to be missing in our 
collective analysis of our legal 
system and we aren’t delving 
into a psychological issue in 
America’s conscience.

In the Patriot Act, domestic 

terrorism is defined as any 
act “dangerous to human life” 
or actions that “appear to 
be intended to intimidate or 
coerce a civilian population; 
to influence the policy of a 
government by intimidation 
or coercion; or to affect the 
conduct 
of 
a 
government 

by 
mass 
destruction, 

assassination, or kidnapping.”

This 
language 
seems 

to 
obviously 
describe 

the 
behavior 
of 
the 

white 
supremacists 
in 

Charlottesville, but I think 

this phrasing is a bit broad. 
Now I know many people 
would 
say 
otherwise, 
but 

uniquely, there is noticeably 
not a specific group being 
targeted in this language. 
With regards to international 
terrorism, 
this 
is 
defined 

significantly clearer. In the 
wake of 9/11, a joint resolution, 
titled the “Authorization for 
Use of Military Force,” came 
into effect. It reads that the 
“President is authorized to use 
all necessary and appropriate 
force against those nations, 
organizations, 
or 
persons 

he 
determines 
planned, 

authorized, 
committed, 
or 

aided the terrorist attacks 
that occurred on September 
11, 2001.”

We 
know 
what 
groups 

(al-Qaida and the Taliban) and 
individuals (Osama bin Laden) 
perpetrated the attacks on 
9/11. 
We 
understand 
the 

actions and ideologies that 
those entities support. And 
we are quick to define it in 
our legal code. Though the 
“Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 

Military Force” has broad 
language as well, this glaringly 
shows 
we 
have 
an 
issue 

recognizing, discussing and 
naming domestic terrorism, 
be it white supremacists or 
any other hate group.

More importantly, domestic 

terrorism is actually not a 
crime in the United States. 
Why? 
Because 
domestic 

terrorism as a charge does 
not 
exist. 
Almost 
always, 

such acts are charged as 
hate crimes, which in most 
states are felonies. However, 
this furthers the issue that 
we 
can’t 
define 
domestic 

terrorism 
because 
it 
isn’t 

technically a crime in the first 
place — it’s never specifically 
stated as such. Nonetheless, 
these issues in our legal code 
I think guide us to the real 
issue. This broad language 
is the byproduct of a deeper 
problem, and we as humans 
are not cognizant enough to 
recognize this flaw.

Humans, on a psychological 

basis, 
love 
to 
mentally 

categorize. It is how our 
memory 
works. 
Robert 

Sapolsky, 
a 
Stanford 

neuroendocrinologist, 
explains 
that 
putting 

explanations, 
facts 
and 

opinions 
into 
clean, 

established 
boxes 
has 

advantages: 
We 
can 

remember the content of those 
explanations and opinions. 

But as humans, we struggle 

with 
realizing 
that 
those 

“walls” of categorization are 
highly arbitrary. Once some 
arbitrary 
boundary 
exists, 

we often become enamored 
with its importance, impeding 
our 
ability 
to 
question, 

contemplate, 
debate 
and 

challenge those explanations. 
This mental processing does 
not exclude our collective 
American conscience. It is 
much easier to build these 
capricious 
mental 
walls 

externally, 
but 
examining 

our internal walls can be 
unpleasant. This is exactly the 
root of the issue.

The 
“Authorization 
for 

Use of Military Force” clause 
describes 
this 
ability 
to 

“externally 
define” 
quite 

well. When there is an enemy, 
often across an ocean and a 
continent, 
the 
boundaries 

are clear. It’s us versus them. 
Borders 
aren’t 
necessarily 

arbitrary, but the belief that 
human 
psychology 
varies 

vastly across countries is, 
in 
my 
view, 
false. 
When 

confronted with issues about 
our own well-being, too often 
we can’t seem to describe our 
problems. This is due to the 
fact that we put boundaries 
around 
our 
nation’s 

conscience so as to insulate 
its 
importance, 
rendering 

our ability for a collective 
introspection 
divisive 
and 

combative. It is almost as if 
we, as a country, act as one 
person. It’s much easier to 
notice the flaws and positives 
around us (the United States 
vs. the world), but requiring 
us 
to 
question 
our 
own 

individual “greatness” is far 
more arduous.

When defining the actions 

against 
a 
mosque 
in 
the 

United States, or the attack 
in 
Charlottesville, 
these 

despicable 
events 
occur 

within our “walls.” When 
senators and representatives 
from both sides commented 
that Trump easily utters the 
words “radical Islamic terror” 
but 
struggles 
to 
declare 

domestic terrorism, I know 
he isn’t alone. Many struggle 
with these comments, mostly 
due to the fact that when 
recognizing a flaw in the 
societal 
conscience, 
it 
is 

tedious and painful. We can’t 
think about why domestic 
terrorism charges don’t exist, 
but international terrorism 
charges do. We can’t analyze 
why it’s easy to “preach” on 
terrorism 
abroad, 
but 
not 

internally. Only when we, as a 
nation, can mutually recognize 
our illogical boundary, can we 
define white supremacy as a 
terrorist group, in addition to 
being a group simply of hate.

Naming white supremacy

T

he rise of the internet 
has 
ushered 
in 
an 

age 
of 
enhanced 

interconnectedness. 
New 

innovations 
like 
social 

media and smartphones link 
individuals in ways previously 
unimaginable. 
Advances 
in 

technology have allowed us to 
connect digitally across states, 
countries and continents. With 
social media and smartphones, 
the 
American 
people 
can 

share opinions, debate issues 
and 
achieve 
unprecedented 

progress. But we’re failing to 
take advantage of it, as we’re 
more divided now than ever.

A 
Pew 
Research 
Center 

report in January found that 
95 percent of Americans now 
own a cellphone, and 77 percent 
carry around a smartphone — 
up from 35 percent in 2011. The 
proportion of internet users 
in the United States is even 
higher: currently at 88 percent 
and rising every year.

The 
digitalization 
of 
the 

United States has completely 
shifted 
its 
socioeconomic 

landscape, and it has brought 
people 
together 
like 
never 

before. High school classmates 
used to wait 10 years to catch up 
after graduation; now, they can 
learn about one another’s lives 
daily through Facebook. The 
iPhone makes texting easy; a 
quick conversation with a cousin 
on the other side of the country 
is only a few clicks away. And 
these examples are old news 
— innovations like driverless 
cars and the cloud will pull 
Americans even closer together.

In 
fact, 
it’s 
unlikely 

the 
accelerating 
pace 
of 

connectivity will slow down. 
According to Moore’s law, which 
states the power of microchips 
doubles every two years, it is 
only going to keep speeding up. 
Moore’s law is why we’re in this 
moment right now, and it’s why 
we’re going to continue on a 
breakneck rate of digitalization 
— and connectivity — for the 
foreseeable 
future. 
High-

powered 
computing 
means 

high-speed 
communications 

with 
significantly 
more 

people. So what’s the use of 
digitalization and its greatest 
outcome, connectivity?

At a conference in 1994, the 

late historian William H. McNeill 
expressed his belief that the 
primary engine of history is contact 
with strangers holding unfamiliar 
skills and notions. He believed in 
the importance of “our capacity 
to invent new ideas, practices and 
institutions.” Further, he said 
invention “… flourished best when 
contacts with strangers compelled 
different ways of thinking. ...”

McNeill’s hypothesis has a 

renewed gravity in 2017: There 
has never been a better time 
for new inventions and new 
ideas, because there has never 
been a period in human history 
steeped in so much contact with 
strangers — the kind of contact 
that induces new and different 
thinking. In short, digitalization 
breeds 
connectivity, 
and 

connectivity 
drives 
history 

through new ideas.

So 
why 
then 
are 
we 

becoming 
more 
politically 

divided? Political parties are 
racing to the extremes, and 
Americans 
are 
following, 

hurdling toward the far left or 
the far right and dismissing any 
opportunities for compromise 
and understanding. How could 
this be?

Much has been said about 

social 
media’s 
apparently 

negative impact on society. 
Prof. 
Edward 
Mendelson 

of Columbia University has 
written about the internet’s 
role in making our lives more 
public but less authentic and 
connected. Virginia Heffernan, 
in her book “Magic and Loss,” 
postulates that social media 
has become a platform for 
celebrating 
ourselves 
rather 

than starting a dialogue. Even 
former President Barack Obama 
has weighed in on the pitfalls of 
social media. Just before the 
election he said Facebook and 
Twitter have served to deepen 
political divisions.

These theories, though valid, 

simply define the dilemma. Our 
task is to use our newfound 
connectivity to actually connect.

Need another reason to think 

we have to start embracing 
connectedness? 
The 
Islamic 

State group lives and breathes 
on it; the terror group likely 
wouldn’t be relevant if it didn’t 
take advantage of digitalization 
— particularly through social 
media — to inspire jihadists 
around the globe. ISIS, unlike 
al-Qaida and the terror groups 
before it, deploys a strategy 
dependent less on control and 
more 
on 
rousing 
potential 

terrorists to do damage. Thus, 
jihadists have employed the 
digital age better than we have. 
Terrorists have adapted. The 
American people haven’t.

We 
need 
to 
embrace 

the 
opportunity 
that 

interconnectedness 
presents. 

In a country that has worked 
to fight racism, sexism and 
homophobia (and made great 
strides in each of those battles, 
notwithstanding 
different 

setbacks), one of our biggest 
issues now is that we can’t be 
around people who disagree 
with us. We’re stuck in silos, 
even 
though 
digitalization 

makes building bridges easier 
than ever before.

The 
choice 
between 

coming together and running 
apart will help define our 
country’s 
standing 
in 
an 

increasingly 
digital 
world. 

With 
globalization 
at 
full 

speed, doing nothing will only 
cause the United States to fail. 
Silencing the opposition by 
muting, blocking or unfollowing 
on social media won’t make us 
any better at understanding 
and compromising. We need 
social media to act as our 
friend: Facebook and Twitter 
should 
be 
geared 
toward 

conversation and the collective 
construction of ideas. After all, 
this is the purpose of the age 
in which we’re living — one of 
newfound influences, networks 
and platforms. This is the Age 
of Connectivity. It’s time we 
start taking advantage of it.

n the Statement article, 
“Free Speech in the Ivory 
Tower,” the author states 

“According 
to 
University 

spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald, 
the University has a high bar for 
when to intervene in protests, 
and has not done so in recent 
memory.” This is untrue. On 
Nov. 30, 2006, the University 
violently intervened in a protest 
of a speech at the Michigan 
League by Raymond Tanter, a 
proponent of regime change in 
Iran. The University brought in 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
to assist. Officers injured three 
people. One person required 
transport to the University 
of 
Michigan 
Emergency 

Department with a head injury 
after being thrown to the floor 
and nearly asphyxiated. As 

with many high-profile cases, 
such as that of Eric Garner, 
the protester would call out, 
“I 
can’t 
breathe,” 
before 

becoming unconscious. Had 
I, as a physician on the scene, 
not spoken up to persuade 
the 
University 
officers 
to 

stop, the protester could have 
been yet another victim of 
fatal positional asphyxiation 
by cops. Emergency medical 
technicians were summoned 
and administered inappropriate 
and punitive measures, causing 
me again to speak up to get 
them to stop. This provoked 
a violent assault by an Ann 
Arbor Police Department cop, 
reminiscent of a recent attack 
on a nurse for trying to protect 
a patient. Cops arrested three 
protesters that night and went 

on to bring criminal charges 
against five. Although four 
agreed to plea bargains, this 
writer struggled to prove her 
innocence and after a six-day 
trial was acquitted. The city of 
Ann Arbor eventually settled 
my first and fourth amendment 
case against the AAPD officer 
who assaulted me. Fitzgerald’s 
above 
statement 
misleads 

readers to believe that the 
University would never violate 
the constitutional right to free 
expression. The violent attack 
on political protesters on Nov. 
30, 2006, and its aftermath 
prove otherwise.

The National’s newest 
testifies to age, memory

The first time I heard The 

National I was sitting in my 
dad’s car. We had just left 
Barnes & Noble, where he 
had spent hours 
pouring over the 
music and video 
section, 
making 

careful selections, 
then 
returning, 

then 
selecting 

again. It was a 
time when Barnes 
& Noble’s vast supply of albums 
in countless genres still served 
a purpose; it was a time before 
iTunes streamed and Spotify 
robbed. You had to use the 
scanners propped up next to a 
pair of headphones to listen to a 
preview of an album.

I don’t remember what my 

winnings from the Barnes & 
Noble trip were. But my dad’s 
blasted through the speakers 
on the drive home, the next 
morning on the way to school, 
the next week, month and so 
on. When the first notes of High 
Violet’s intro track “Terrible 
Love” hit me, it was straight in 
the chest. And as a result, the 
songs and the album became 
inescapable.

High Violet has carried me 

through so much of my life. 
It’s the record I play when I 
want someone else to put words 
to what I’m feeling, when I 
want singer Matt Berninger’s 
mumblings to carry me through 
the day or the month or the 
year. My sister would blast 
“Bloodbuzz Ohio” every time 
we hit the highway in Buffalo, 
returning home after months 
in Michigan. I carried my 
record player into my room 
on a shitty day last year and 
played “Lemonworld” at top 
volume until I fell asleep. Every 
piece of it has attached itself 
to my life in a different way, 
and when the sad, sad months 
of January and February make 
their return once a year, I find 
myself retreating back into its 
cold hug.

But it’s not just High Violet; 

it’s all of it. Boxer, Alligator, 
Trouble Will Find Me, Cherry 
Tree — piecing them together 
is piecing together the last 
two years of my life. So here 
we are, on the precipice of my 
third year with Berninger and 
the Dessners with their newest 
release, Sleep Well Beast. Here 
we are with something different 
and something brilliant. From 
Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers 
to now, the band has aged — 
they’re in their forties now — 
and they’ve perfected.

It’s all in the music. What 

are these synthy sounds on 
“Walk It Back” and the chorus 
at the start of “The System 
Always Dreams in Darkness”? 
The smooth, sad perfection 
they once curated has been 
pushed a step further and has 
taken a step back. This record 
finds 
producer, 
keyboardist 

and guitarist Aaron Dessner at 
his most experimental — synth 
progressions ease us into the 
third track with sporadic static 
leading us out, and we pause, 
greeted only by a harmony at 
the start of “The System.” Not 
to mention “Turtleneck,” a 
song that sticks out from the 

rest of the record in its bluesy 
aggression and dueling guitars. 
But then, there’s a step back. 
It has been a while since we’ve 
heard the band do rock ‘n’ roll. 
The drum and electric heavy 
sound of Boxer and Alligator 
have finally returned to us after 
the melancholy of High Violet 

and Trouble Will 
Find Me.

Yet 
Berninger 

is still brooding. 
It’s 
easy 
to 

dismiss 
The 

National as a sad 
band, but it’s more 
accurate to say 

they’re a reflective one. Their 
songs and music present easily 
interchangeable reflections on 
their personal lives as well as 
our current political climate. 
Sleep Well Beast, after all, was 
co-written 
with 
Berninger’s 

wife Carin Besser. Events that 
unfold over the course of the 
songs like “Guilty Party” and 
“Carin at the Liquor Store” 
concern real and fictionalized 
accounts of their relationship. 
But they also concern us and 
the world. They concern real 
and fake news.

In a recent interview with 

The Atlantic, Berninger talked 
about this specific overlap in 
his songs: “Politics is personal. 
I don’t understand why people 
separate love and politics in 
their art — and I don’t know who 
does. We don’t expect people 
who write novels to be like, 
‘Oh, this chapter is the political 
chapter and over here is the 
love chapter.’ Somewhere along 
the line, musicians felt it was 
uncool to be political. It never 
made any sense to me. Who’s 
cooler than Nina Simone?”

There is an inescapable tie 

between love and politics in 
these songs. Most evidently, 
this is heard on “Walk It Back” 
which has a soundcut of Lisa 
Hannigan reciting a quote from 
a New York Times interview 
with an unamed Bush aide 
(later named as Karl Rove) 
about the Bush administration. 
“We’re history’s actors,” he 
says. Rove and Bush in the big 
office, 
they’re 
creating 
the 

reality. The rest of us are meant 
to sit out in the dirt and await 
their decisions. While Rove 
adamantly denies the quote 
(and The National has already 
called him out via Twitter), the 
point still remains clear. “Walk 
It Back” is the stuff of “Fake 
Empire” 
— 
simultaneously 

the 
story 
of 
a 
collapsing 

relationship paralleled by a 
collapsing 
political 
reality 

just as “Fake Empire” was a 
ravishing political commentary 
yet at the same time a drinking 
song.

Once again, we are presented 

with fiction and nonfiction, 
the dissolution of an unknown 
relationship next to inescapable 
political and social realities. 
But there is no love lost, only 
words. Like in “Guilty Party,” a 
song chronicling the inevitable 
spiraling 
of 
a 
relationship 

where one member is simply 
left with no anger, no blame, 
simply nothing left to say. And 
the same goes for “Dark Side 
of the Gym,” Sleep Well Beast’s 
uncontestable love song. Even 
this one dissolves into silence: 
“There was still nothing I could 
say,” he sings.

But what is the final tie 

between 
the 
real 
and 
the 

unreal, what we create in the 
physical world and what solely 
exists in our minds? Sleep, 
dreams and their unruliness 
is what Berninger seems to 
suggest. But we seem to forget 
that self-medication applies to 
sleeping pills and substance 
abuse; this is the premise of “I’ll 
Still Destroy You.” It carries us 
through various states of mind 
from alcohol and drugs to sleep 
and sex. “I’ll Still Destroy You” 
and “Sleep Well Beast” are 
sisters in this regard. As the 
songs progress, we progress 
through 
various 
states 
of 

Berninger — an inebriated one, 
a sober one, a pill wrecked one, 
a tired one. But while “Destroy 
You” builds up into a crescendo 
of noise, “Sleep Well Beast” 
dissolves into silence. “Sleep 
Well Beast” has a conclusion; 

“Destroy You” remains restless.

You can take The National’s 

songs and make mansions or 
sandcastles out of them. Just 
as “Turtleneck” can build you 
up, “Empire Line” can tear you 
down. “Day I Die” will pull and 
push you forward, but Aaron 
Dessner on the piano in “Carin 
at the Liquor Store” will be the 
sand that slips through your 
fingers. Because in the same 
way I can string together the 
last two years of my life, you 
can piece together their records 
as a whole, and songs from 
records released years apart. 
Just as “Day I Die” is an answer 
to the preceding track “Nobody 
Else Will Be There,” “Guilty 
Party” invariably reminds one 
of the tragedy that is “Pink 
Rabbits” and “Carin” responds 
to “Karen.” These albums tell 
the story of Berninger’s, the 
Dessners’ and the Devendorfs’ 
lives. This album tells the story 
of love, loss, struggle, insecurity 
and time that is running out.

I’ve felt for a while that time 

is running out for me. My life is 
careening toward another end, 
another finale come May of this 
year. And I’m utterly terrified. 
But Sleep Well Beast, just as it 
strings together bits and pieces 
of these men’s lives, it strings 
together my own. “Walk It 
Back” keeps playing over and 
over again in my mind whether 
or not I have headphones on 
because of Berninger mumbling 
“I can’t stay and I can’t come 
back.” And I’m simply left 
thinking about Buffalo and Ann 
Arbor and how the familiar 
crescendos 
of 
“Bloodbuzz 

Ohio” won’t be heard on the 
highway back home for a long, 
long time. It’s the endings of all 
ends, the time when the fictions 
of college meet the reality of 
the world. So here’s to The 
National, seeing me out.

Latest ‘Narcos’ delivers 
despite change of focus

As one of its first original 

series, Netflix brought the 
story 
of 
legendary 
drug 

kingpin 
Pablo 
Escobar 
to 

the 
small-screen 
through 

“Narcos.” 
After 
wrapping 

up Escobar’s exploits in two 
seasons, “Narcos” 
faced the daunting 
task 
of 
entirely 

remodeling 
a 

show 
that 
was 

built 
around 

Wagner 
Moura’s 

(“Elysium”) 
terrifying 

performance as Escobar. With 
its third season, not only has 
“Narcos” 
succeeded 
in 
its 

tough assignment, but it has 
also produced a sleeker show 
with a more diverse cast. 
Already a quality series, the 
sharp third installment of 
“Narcos” continues the show’s 
run of success.

One of the most glaring 

issues with the show’s first 
two seasons was the constant 
narration by protagonist Steve 
Murphy 
(Boyd 
Holbrook, 

“Logan”). Holbrook’s drawling 
voiceover 
always 
sounded 

slightly different from how 
his character spoke in the 
series — not to mention that 
the first season’s narration 
was incessant. With Holbrook 
written out of the series at the 
end of the second season, his 
co-star Pedro Pascal (“Game of 
Thrones”) takes over narrative 
duties in this new “Narcos” 
season.

The result is a voiceover that 

is significantly less distracting 
and 
annoying, 
though 

“Narcos” does continue to 
struggle with spoonfeeding 
its plot to viewers. While the 
voiceover is necessary at times, 
the series still goes overboard 
with its exposition. In a prime 

example of this unnecessary 
narration, 
this 
season’s 

premiere 
episode 
— 
“The 

Kingpin Strategy” — features 
Pascal describing the Cali 
Cartel’s 
business 
practices. 

Although “Narcos” highlights 
Cali’s 
professional 
way 
of 

doing business throughout the 
episode, Pascal’s voiceover still 
hands viewers these scenes 
through narration, with Pascal 

detailing 
how, 

“It was fucking 
Cocaine, 
Incorporated. 
And they ran it 
like a Fortune 
500 company.”

Despite 
its 
voiceover 

drawbacks, 
“Narcos” 

successfully 
blends 
history 

and fiction. The series aptly 
writes 
in 
historical 
drug 

traffickers 
throughout 
its 

plotlines and intersperses clips 
of news anchors like Walter 
Cronkite 
and 
Dan 
Rather 

discussing 
these 
figures. 

Compared to show’s constant 
narration, these clips better 
convey information to viewers 
and also provide an intriguing 
perspective into how these 
traffickers 
were 
perceived 

when they were active in the 
mid-1990s. 
Using 
historical 

traffickers 
also 
enables 

“Narcos” to draw upon real-
world events for inspiration, 
which helps to deepen the 
universe 
into 
something 

resembling 
a 
documentary 

more than a drama.

In 
Season 
Three, 

“Narcos” brings in a host 
of new characters — and 
re-introduces several old ones 
— that work well on-screen, 
with the so-called four “Cali 
Godfathers” 
providing 
the 

show with new energy and 
diversity. 
While 
Moura 

unquestionably impressed in 
his role as Escobar in seasons 
one and two, having a single 
antagonist somewhat limited 

the series’s ability to develop 
a distinct type of villain, with 
Escobar’s cruelty defining his 
tenure on “Narcos.”

However, 
in 
this 
latest 

season, the series has four 
leaders of the Cali Cartel 
upon 
which 
to 
focus 
— 

Gilberto Rodríguez (Damián 
Alcázar, “El Narco”), Miguel 
Rodríguez (Francisco Denis, 
“The 
Liberator”), 
Pacho 

Herrera 
(Alberto 
Ammann, 

“Cell 211”) and “Chepe” (Pêpê 
Rapazote, “Shameless”), all of 
whom give “Narcos” a more 
interesting cast. As exciting as 
Escobar was, he was singular 
in his viciousness, unlike the 
“Cali Godfathers” who label 
themselves 
the 
“Gentlemen 

of Cali” and are less prone to 
violence. This is one of the most 
intriguing and ironic aspects 
of the show’s new season, 
since drug traffickers are often 
defined by their bloodshed and 
sadism. Despite coming at the 
expense of some of the series’s 
non-stop action, this transition 
will help “Narcos” carve out a 
new identity in post-Escobar 
seasons.

Although 
most 
of 
the 

series’s new cast excels, two of 
the new DEA agents flop badly. 
Working with Pascal, new 
agents Chris Feistl (Michael 
Stahl-David, 
“Cloverfield”) 

and Daniel Van Ness (Matt 
Whelan, “Go Girls”) struggle 
to 
develop 
chemistry 
and 

often come off as oblivious 
and incompetent. Feistl looks 
and sounds almost like a worse 
version of Murphy, whereas 
Whelan 
seems 
entirely 

miscast in his role. As much 
as Murphy struggles during 
his two seasons on “Narcos,” 
he was nowhere near as out-
of-place as Feistl or Whelan. 
If that’s the worst thing about 
the show’s third installment 
though, then it must be a 
strong season.

FINGERPRINT RELEASING

‘Home Again’ a contrived, 
uncomfortable experience

“Home Again” follows the 

bond between Alice, a 40-year-
old single mother, and a trio of 
handsome 
young 
filmmakers 

who stay in her guest house 
and help raise her children. The 
film’s cast, spearheaded by Reese 
Witherspoon (“Big Little Lies”), 
boasts 
of 
actors 

with success in the 
realm of romantic 
comedies: Nat Wolff 
(“Death 
Note”), 

Jon 
Rudnitsky 

(“Saturday 
Night 

Live”) 
and 
Pico 

Alexander 
(“War 

Machine”) 
play 

Teddy, George and 
Harry respectively. The film tries 
hard to mimic the flirty tension of 
the three-to-one dynamic present 
in successes like “New Girl,” with 
the added element of motherhood 
for 
a 
fresh 
twist. 
However, 

everything 
about 
this 
movie 

is 
uncomfortable, 
unrealistic 

and odd; the cliché writing and 
sappy acting combine to create 
an inauthentic portrayal of the 
modern family.

At its base, the film’s premise 

is highly unrealistic, resting on 
the assumption that three hot 
20-somethings in LA would trip 
over themselves to care for Reese 
Witherspoon and act as unorthodox 

father figures for her two daughters, 
rather than hang out in the city with 
people their own age. While the 
three guys sort of advance their own 
careers, a large majority of their time 
is spent talking to and about Alice. 
The film’s acting and writing work in 
tandem to elicit cringing discomfort, 
propelled by two overly precocious 
children and carried home by 
Harry’s awful flirtatious one-liners.

What is most frustrating about 

“Home 
Again” 

is its portrayal of 
the 
age-gender 

dynamic. 
Much 

of 
the 
movie’s 

plot 
rests 
on 

the 
relationship 

between 
Alice 

and Harry. Their 
romance 
evolves 

from a one-night 

stand to a seemingly exclusive 
commitment, until conflict ensues 
when Harry stands her up and 
Alice breaks it off. Films featuring 
an 
independent, 
sexual 
older 

woman sleeping with a younger 
man often characterize the woman 
as sexually insatiable, but she 
is ultimately uninterested in a 
meaningful relationship with the 
young man (think: “The Boy Next 
Door” and, a little better, “The 
Graduate”).

Alternatively, in “Home Again,” 

the 
dynamic 
between 
Alice 

and Harry is one of passion but 
also of genuine companionship. 
However, the film fails to fully 

explore this subversion of the 
genre to actually address the age 
gap seriously and discuss how 
differing levels of maturity and 
experience are negotiated in a 
legitimate relationship. In other 
words, what could potentially be 
problematic or empowering is 
largely ignored. Instead, the film 
is much more interested in all 
three men being in love with Alice 
without ever addressing it outright, 
resulting in basically no character 
development.

“Home 
Again” 
is 
another 

example of a film that suffers by 
way of poor acting despite a cast of 
established talent. Though helmed 
by the esteemed Witherspoon 
and 
flanked 
with 
supporting 

performances from Michael Sheen 
(“Passengers”), Lake Bell (“I Do… 
Until I Don’t”) and Candice Bergen 
(“Rules Don’t Apply”), the movie 
reads like a C-list Netflix original, 
exemplifying 
the 
Hollywood 

paradox in which bad films come 
from great actors.

Ultimately, “Home Again” is a 

contrived romantic comedy with 
a superficial, tedious tone. What 
this tame movie desperately needs 
is an R-rating, raunchier sex, a 
healthy dose of expletives and 
a rougher edge. Without these 
elements, “Home Again” is a one-
dimensional, watered down film 
in which every character goes 
through the motions of a formulaic 
romantic comedy without genuine 
feeling or intrigue.

and will meet you there, do not 
/ raise your fist. Do not raise / 
your small voice against it. And 
do not / take cover. Instead, curl 
your toes / into the grass, watch 
the cloud / ascending from your 
lips. Walk / through the garden’s 
dormant splendor. / Say only, 
thank you. / Thank you.”

- Ross Gay

I like to think back to when 

I was a kid, running in my 
backyard, 
imagining 
I 
was 

in some different universe. I 
was fighting off yet another 
mythical creature. My heels 
slamming against the dirt, my 
toes zipping through the blades 
of grass. I was unstoppable.

Many kids are told to put on 

their shoes before they leave 
the 
house, 
preparing 
them 

for rocks, sticks, glass and 
other existing entities that 
are known to hurt them. But 
never, in my adolescence nor 
now, do I want to wear shoes. 
I despise creating that barrier 
between my human body and 
Earth’s surface; the space that 
disallows my barefeet to settle 
into the grass.

For anyone who meditates, 

they know that nature tends 
to heighten the experience. 
There’s the soothing sound of 
wind, insects or waves, and 
even the relieving freshness 
of mountain-top air. There is 
the sense of truly indulging 
yourself in the outdoors. And 
most importantly, it’s about 

touching the bare Earth itself, 
in all of its matter and magic, 
that guides one into a raw, 
soulful meditation.

Poet Ross Gay translates 

this in his piece “Thank You.” 
He writes, “Instead, curl your 
toes / into the grass, watch 
the cloud / ascending from 
your lips…” allowing his words 
to paint the reader a picture 
of nature’s pure beauty and 
bliss. After reading this entire 
poem, I found multiple angles 
in which one could interpret 
the piece. Nevertheless, I like 
to think that it can directly 
translate to meditation and the 
overwhelming dominance that 
nature has against humans.

In this case, nature is not 

working against the human 
mind or body. Instead, she 
is bringing one closer to her 
sweet serenity — curling our 
human toes into the grass, 
the soil, the sand. It’s this 
soulful connection that can be 
felt when we physically sink 
ourselves into the Earth.

This type of meditation, 

one where you place your 
barefeet or walk in the grass 
for about 20 minutes, has many 
different 
titles. 
“Earthing” 

and “grounding” meditations 
are popular names, yet there 

is something that is rightfully 
unrefined about this process 
that makes it simply natural 
 

simply raw.

Sure, we are humans and 

not hobbits; we can’t just trek 
mountains and sharp rocks with 
the bare souls of our feet. No 
one knows what lies in the grass 
or in the soil, and one may be 
afraid to step on something that 
feels uncomfortable or could 
harm them. But maybe that 
unsettling feeling is the point. 
Everyday, people wake up and 
face the day, not knowing what 
will happen — that slightest, 
most native feeling of anxiety.

That is the the purpose of this 

meditation: To trust your body 
and mind to walk into nature’s 
unending, mysterious universe. 
The possibilities of nature are 
limitless and frightening, but 
surely that is what it means to 
be human too.

So, I tell myself that I can be 

that fearless little kid again, 
running through the grass and 
dirt of my backyard. That little 
kid that doesn’t worry, but is 
joyfully living and joyfully, 
simply, being. This meditation 
is what brings me back to that 
state.

The 
simplicity 
of 
raw 

meditation 
is 
that 
it 
is 

accessible, it is natural, and 
it is trustworthy. After this 
practice, one feels grounded 
and connected. Those who 
practice this knows that they 
are one with the Earth. Who 
ever thought that nature could 
teach us how to trust ourselves?

And if mediation is still a 

new concept for you, take Ross 
Gay’s words for advice: “Walk 
through the garden’s dormant 
splendor. / Say only, thank you. 
Thank you.”

Way scores three,
‘M’ defeats Aggies

Emma Way wanted to prove 

her coach wrong.

After starting the first five 

games of the season, the junior 
forward found herself on the 
bench as the buzzer sounded to 
begin the match at Ocker Field on 
Sunday afternoon.

She was clearly frustrated. 

Rather than sulk though, she 
channeled that anger into success. 
Way anchored the Michigan field 
hockey team’s offense by recording 
the first hat trick of her career.

“Two of (my goals) were 

actually assisted by my good 
friend 
Meg 

(Dowthwaite) 
and we connect 
really 
well,” 

Way said. “So 
it felt good to 
score goals with 
her today.”

Inserted 

in 
the 
10th 

minute, 
Way 

quickly 
began 

her 
offensive 

surge, scoring eight minutes later 
on a rebound shot. Then, she added 
two more goals in the second half 
— the first off a pass from the right 
side — and another to cap off her 
performance, a one-timer from the 
middle of the circle.

Sunday’s performance was a 

long time coming for Way — even if 
she began the game on the bench. 
Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz 
has 
noticed 
improvements 

in 
Way’s 
confidence 
and 

aggressiveness.

While the offensive side of 

Way’s game shined the most on 
Sunday, her defense, in particular, 
has really stood out to Pankratz 
this season.

“Her 
tackling 
back 
and 

doubling 
down 
on 
defense 

creates a lot of counterattack 
opportunities for her,” Pankratz 
said. “And she’s just so natural at 
getting great touches on the ball. 
It’s something you can’t teach, it’s 

really special.

“She’s just a dangerous dynamic 

player. It’s just fun to watch.”

It is traits such as these that 

have made Way a consistent 
starter this season. But for 
Pankratz, with her team in the 
midst of a two-game of losing 
streak — including a shutout loss 
Friday night — she needed to 
shake up her lineup.

Her tinkering paid off. Seven 

different players Michigan scored 
nine goals for Michigan against 
UC Davis.

“It feels great,” Pankratz said. 

“We were really deep and had a lot 
of versatility in the goal scoring, 
and that’s hard to scout and hard 

to play against, so 
I feel great about 
it. We have a lot of 
talented players.”

As 
an 

upperclassman on 
a team with eight 
freshmen, Way is 
often looked as a 
symbol of stability 
and 
assistance. 

Frequently, 
the 

young players will 

look to her for guidance and advice.

And while some older players 

may grow tired of this questioning, 
Way sees it as an honor, enjoying 
helping the first-year members 
of the team adjust to the rigors of 
NCAA life.

Pankratz notices the impact 

that players such as Way have 
made on the freshmen.

“She’s being more assertive 

and has a great presence on the 
field,” Pankratz said. “And so she 
has been running down plays 
and doubling down and making 
a difference in the circle and 
outmaneuvering 
the 
defender 

and making some really confident 
goal-scoring shots.”

Though she initially was upset 

at her coach’s decision to go with 
an atypical starting lineup, Way 
used the shift as motivation for a 
career game. Her coach was happy 
too, as her shifts with the starters 
led to an offensive barrage.

Wolverines rebound with win over UC Davis

All it took was 75 seconds 

Sunday for the Michigan field 
hockey team to get its groove 
back. 

Converting on a corner by 

junior defender Maggie Bettez, 
senior 
midfielder 
Katie 
Trombetta 
slammed a direct shot into the 
back of the cage, opening up 
scoring for the seventh-ranked 
Wolverines. It was immediately 
apparent 
that 
Michigan’s 

presence differed from Friday 
night, where it saw an offensive 
slump, taking just five shots 
throughout the game.

Following the first goal, the 

Wolverines never relinquished 
their intensity and continued 
to dominate in a lopsided game. 
Michigan (4-2) outshot UC Davis 
(0-6) 30-1, drawing nine penalty 
corners at Ocker Field on Sunday 
afternoon. 
In 
their 
highest 

scoring game of the season, the 
Wolverines overwhelmed the 
Aggies, 9-0, rebounding from 
their previous two losses. 

“I think we thought more 

about our play versus their 
play,” said junior forward Emma 
Way. “I think on Friday we kind 
of went down to their level and 
didn’t get to really play our 
game. Today we were focused 
on what we do well, and every 
individual player doing their 
own job.”

Michigan 
demonstrated 

depth in addition to command, 
with seven separate players 
seeing goals throughout the 
game. 
Sophomore 
midfielder 

Kate Walker earned her first 
collegiate goal, and the final 
goal of the first half. With 2:50 
remaining, Walker sent a ball 
into the cage off a broken corner. 

“We were really deep and had 

a lot of versatility in the goal 
scoring,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “That’s hard 
to scout and hard to play against, 
so I feel great about it. We have a 
lot of talented players.”

It would be hard to find a 

minute in Sunday’s game that 
the Wolverines didn’t have their 

sticks on the ball, maintaining 
control in their attacking zone 
for the majority of the game. 
This provided comfort for senior 
goalkeeper Sam Swenson and 
freshman goalkeeper Sidonie 
LaPlante, who played in the 
second half for her collegiate 
debut. The two combined for the 
shutout in the cage.

One of Michigan’s greatest 

strengths 
displayed 
was 
its 

ability 
to 

capitalize 
on 
penalty 

corners. 
Seventeen 
minutes 
into 

the game, Way 
drew a penalty 
corner, crossing 
the 
ball 
to 

sophomore 
forward 
Meg 

Dowthwaite 
who 
buried 

into 
the 

corner of the 
cage. Dowthwaite was a vital 
part of the Wolverine offense, 
contributing three assists on the 
day.

Rushing the circle again just 

a minute later, Way punched 
the ball into the goal off a 
rebound, adding another goal 

to Michigan’s scoreboard. The 
junior earned her first career hat 
trick in the game. 

After Walker’s goal made the 

score 5-0 at halftime, Michigan 
didn’t let up in the second 
half, showcasing a dynamic 
performance with a shot count 
in the second half (16) surpassing 
that in the first (14).

After close scoring attempts 

off back-to-back corners in the 

38th minute of the 
game, 
freshman 

midfielder Kayla 
Reed broke open 
scoring 
in 
the 

second 
half 
at 

41:28. Reed sent a 
reverse chip into 
the top-shelf of 
the cage for her 
second goal of the 
season.

The Wolverines 

continued 
the 

momentum from 
Reed’s 
goal, 

as minutes later, sophomore 
forward 
Fay 
Keijer 
buried 

the ball into the lower left 
corner off a rebound. The flow 
demonstrated in back-to-back 
scoring plays like that between 
Reed and Keijer exemplified 
what Pankratz believed to be 

missing in Friday’s game against 
William & Mary.

“This 
game, 
because 
we 

found a lot of confidence and the 
game was going well, we were 
able to spread out, and spread 
(UC Davis) out,” Pankratz said. 
“There were a lot more gaps for 
them to operate in.”

Way scored Michigan’s final 

two goals of the game, the first 
on a redirected pass at the 
52-minute mark, and the second 
in which she one-timed a pass 
with 12 minutes remaining. 
After they scored the last goal, 
the Wolverines maintained ball 
control, keeping UC Davis at 
their heels for the remainder of 
the time.

Though Michigan had a tough 

night Friday, it resurrected its 
offense 
Sunday, 
completely 

abandoning 
its 
struggles. 

And that could be helpful, as 
Michigan State comes to Ann 
Arbor to begin Big Ten play 
Friday. 

“I think (today) helps with 

our confidence,” Pankratz said. 
“We played sharp and crisp 
today, which we were trying to 
achieve Friday night, and I think 
it’s a good stepping stone for the 
Big Ten season which is starting 
Friday.”

WOMEN’S SOCCER
Emphasis on defense
leads Michigan to tie

The Michigan women’s soccer 

team fended off No. 17 Wake Forest 
in a scoreless double-overtime 
game despite a potent offensive 
attack by the Demon Deacons. 

The 
Wolverines 
(3-1-3) 

returned home, and just as it had 
in the previous matches, Michigan 
placed emphasis on defense and 
goalkeeping as they fought to 
repel the Wake Forest offense.

Despite starting a relatively 

new back line, the Wolverines 
played 
defense 
quickly 
and 

concisely. Wake Forest looked 
for any chance to break through, 
shooting nine shots, four of which 
were shots on goal. Every one-
on-one scoring opportunity the 
Demon Deacons had was met 
with a swift clearance or block 
that helped relieve pressure on the 
goalkeeper.

“This is a young defense – most 

of them weren’t here last year,” 
said Michigan coach Greg Ryan. 
“Taylor (Timko) was out with 
an injury, Sarah (Stratigakis) 
was gone with Canada. Brooke 
Cilley was out for most of the fall 
and didn’t play in the back. The 
only returning defender is Jada 
(Dayne). They have really come 
together as a back four and the 
goalkeeping behind them has 
been outstanding.”

Freshman goalkeeper Hillary 

Beall made her second start, 
starting 
over 
senior 
Sarah 

Jackson, who played the second 
half. Recording four saves, Beall 
stopped the Demon Deacons 
from capitalizing on mistakes the 
defense made.

At the start of the second 

half, Wake Forest came out 
aggressively. It forced two fouls 
and three shots in the first 15 
minutes, looking to control the 
offensive momentum as they 
had the first half. Despite being 
unable to slow the Demon Deacon 

offense, Michigan avoided being 
scored on, while pressuring the 
opposing forwards to shoot high 
above the post.

In an effort to stop Wake 

Forest’s attackers, the Wolverines 
had their midfield fall back to assist 
the defense. In addition, Michigan 
added a veteran presence in senior 
midfielder Rubina Veerakone to 
control the center of the field, 
which Wake Forest had previously 
dominated.

The 
individual 
efforts 
by 

the defenders alongside strong 
play by the midfield allowed 
the Wolverines to shift the 
momentum, 
creating 
much 

needed scoring opportunities.

With 
that 
momentum, 

Michigan went on the attack, 
which led to a few unsuccessful 
scoring 
attempts. 
After 

recovering 
momentum 
with 

two substitutions, Wake Forest 
retaliated, beating the defense 
to get six shots in the final nine 
minutes of the game.

Despite that relentless attack, 

Michigan’s 
defense 
handled 

the situation in a calm yet gritty 
manner, closing out on forwards 
after being beat and attempting to 
clear loose balls.

While the Demon Deacons 

managed 11 shots in the second 
half and overtime, just two were 
on goal, showing the effort the 
Wolverine defense had put in 
to prevent any Demon Deacon 
opportunity from becoming a 
legitimate scoring threat.

The two shots on goal, however, 

would have been goals had it not 
been for Jackson. Despite not 
starting over Beall, Jackson had a 
great game, making a key save in 
the final minutes.

“So far all three goalkeepers 

have 
just 
been 
outstanding, 

including Megan Hinz,” Ryan 
said. “We’ll always see who looks 
the sharpest, but right now they all 
look sharp. You can pick any one 
and they’re gonna do well.”

Hill stands out in second career start

Deep in his own territory with 

his team trailing late in the fourth 
quarter, Cincinnati’s quarterback 
Hayden Moore rolled out and 
uncorked his 39th pass of the day.

The ball whistled through 

the 
air, 
passing 
sophomore 

defensive back Khaleke Hudson’s 
outstretched right hand. But it did 
not get by sophomore cornerback 
Lavert Hill, who broke on the ball, 
cradled it into both hands and 
sprinted 24 yards untouched into 
the endzone.

It 
was 
Hill’s 
first 
career 

interception 
and 
touchdown, 

and it provided a fitting sense of 
finality against the Bearcats in 
Michigan’s 36-14 win Saturday.

Quite simply, Cincinnati could 

not pass on the Wolverines — 
though that wasn’t for a lack of 
trying. Moore completed just 
15-of-40 attempts for a measly 3.3 
yards per attempt.

Michigan’s success was due in 

part to Hill, making his second 
collegiate start. After opening 
the season against Florida — 
a game in which he gave up 
several completions, including 
a 
34-yarder 
on 
the 
Gators’ 

opening drive — Hill looked like a 
shutdown cornerback.

“Yeah, 
been 
happy 
with 

Lavert,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh on Monday afternoon. 
“He’s asserted himself and played 
very well. Made the big play for us 
in the ball game this past week.”

That 
was 
the 
expectation 

for Hill when the Wolverines 
recruited him — he would play 
sparingly as a freshman, learning 
under 
his 
brother, 
former 

safety Delano Hill, and former 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis. Then, 
he would take over the reins.

And last fall, that was how 

things played out. Hill appeared 
in 11 games, playing corner in nine 
as an important backup behind 
Lewis and Channing Stribling. 
Things 
went 
slightly 
askew, 

though, once the page turned to 

spring ball.

According 
to 
cornerbacks 

coach Mike Zordich, Hill didn’t 
practice much in the spring — 
something that 
the 
coaching 

staff was “very 
disappointed” 
with. 
Hill, 

who 
says 
he 

had 
a 
minor 

concussion, 
worked hard to 
stay on the field, 
but had to deal 
with the injury 
again in August.

Hill 

confirmed there 
was 
a 
sense 

of 
urgency 

on 
his 
part 

this offseason when it came to 
his development. As one of the 
faces of Michigan’s revamped 
secondary, he needed to be ready.

“Yeah, because those guys left 

and just people had to step up and 

take over for them,” Hill said. “I 
just felt like that’s what I had to 
do, and that was it.”

And when he finally returned 

for good in fall 
camp, 
things 

clicked.

“I had suffered 

a couple of minor 
injuries,” Hill said, 
“so after that, I 
just had a better 
mindset 
about 

things 
and 
got 

after it.”

Added 

Harbaugh: “Yeah, 
(Lavert is) doing 
well. Seeing him 
digest information 
very well. Comes 
from good stock. 

You’d love to be Lavert Hill Sr., 
to have Delano Hill playing 
professional football and now 
here you see Lavert in there 
starting at corner, making plays, 
helping his team win.

“Lavert Hill Sr.’s probably 

boring the heck out of the 
neighbors with how well his sons 
are doing.”

Delano, whose rookie season 

with 
the 
Seahawks 
opened 

Sunday, found time to watch his 
younger brother’s game Saturday. 
For the first season ever, he wasn’t 
there to offer advice to Lavert in 
person.

He may not have had any 

wisdom regarding his younger 
brother’s first pick-six, though. 
Delano didn’t register his first 
interception or touchdown until 
his senior year. And perhaps 
with that in mind, any struggles 
Hill had in the spring or fall may 
best be put in perspective. After 
all, he’s still ahead of the family 
curve.

“I talked to (Delano) right 

after the game,” Lavert said. 
“He called me, he just told me 
congratulations and just keep 
working and get some more 
interceptions.”

Sophomore cornerback Lavert Hill returned an interception for a touchdown Saturday, sealing a victory for Michigan.

At this point in the season, 

the 
Michigan 
volleyball 

team has only participated 
in tournaments instead of 
regular matches. According 
to coach Mark Rosen, there 
are both pros and cons to the 
early stretch of tournament 
play.

“It’s good in the sense that 

you get to play more matches 
and you get to play different 
level teams, you can try some 
different things. The Big Ten 
is so competitive that every 
match is just a battle. So you 
can’t really experiment much 
or try something different in 
those matches because you 
really have to be at your very 
best,” Rosen said.

The team traveled to Fort 

Collins, Colo. to participate 
in the CSU Invitational this 
past weekend for its third 
tournament of the season. 
Over the course of three 
days, the Wolverines played 
three matches against Idaho 
State, Colorado State and 
Ball State, winning two.

While 
the 
ability 
to 

experiment can be beneficial, 
tournaments can create an 
accelerated 
environment 

for 
matches. 
On 
Friday, 

the Wolverines played two 
matches in one day.

“It’s 
a 
little 
more 

physically 
challenging,” 

Rosen said. “When you have 
that turnaround, you don’t 
get to know as much about 
the opponent and you don’t 
have time to do as much 
detailed scouting.”

The 
weekend 
started 

out strong for Michigan. It 
opened at 10 a.m. on Friday 
with a clean 3-0 sweep 
against Idaho State. Later 
that 
day, 
the 
Wolverines 

played 
against 
Colorado 

State and ended up with a 
3-0 loss.

The team then had a day off 

to prepare for their Sunday 
match against Ball State.

“It was tough on Friday 

night,” Rosen said. “But the 
team knows that throughout 
the course of the season we 
have to be resilient. I thought 
we had a great practice on 
Saturday and we worked 
some things out.”

The 
Wolverines 
started 

the 
match 
off 
Sunday 

morning with a 25-17 loss in 
the first set.

“They’re 
a 
good, 

competitive team and they 
came out really aggressive 
early on,” Rosen said. “We 
were maybe a little residual 
from Friday night. You start 
to doubt yourself.”

That did not last long, 

however. Michigan picked 
itself up and took a 25-20 
victory in the second set.

The third set proved to be 

the most dominant set of the 
match for the Wolverines, as 
they won 25-11.

Rosen was most impressed 

by 
the 
team’s 
ability 
to 

adjust, not only physically 
but mentally. He praised 
the team for their ability 
to switch their mentality, 
which allowed them to be 
more successful in the later 
sets.

“We were really frustrated 

in the first set and really on 
our heels to flipping that 
within a one set period of 
time where all of the sudden 
we were the aggressor in a 
big way,” Rosen said.

Michigan went on to win 

the fourth set 25-18 and 
close out the weekend with 
a come-from-behind victory.

“We stopped looking like 

we had to be perfect to be 
successful,” Rosen said. “…
You need to let yourself 
be a little more free and 
comfortable with knowing 
that there is going to be some 
mistakes and you can fight 
through that.”

Michigan coach Mark Rosen was impressed by his team’s adjustments.

‘M’ on the brink of new test against Air Force

So far in 2017, Michigan’s 

defense has been its saving 
grace.

While 
the 
offense 
and 

special teams have dealt with 
their fair share of growing 
pains, defensive coordinator 
Don Brown’s unit has suffered 
no such fate.

Even 
the 
fact 
that 
the 

Wolverines’ 
first 
two 

opponents 
have 
scored 
31 

combined 
points 
is 
highly 

misleading — 14 of those points 
came off Florida pick-sixes.

Meanwhile, the defense has 

accounted for 21 of Michigan’s 
69 total points. In short, it has 
has scored four more points 
than it has allowed.

“That’s a good statistic,” 

said fifth-year senior defensive 
tackle Maurice Hurst. “We’ll 
try to keep it as long as 
possible.”

For a unit absorbing the 

losses of all but one starter 
from 2016 — all while adopting 
Brown’s new 3-3-5 scheme — 
the Wolverines’ learning curve 
would have been expected to 
be much steeper.

But that has been far from 

the case. Just ask coach Jim 
Harbaugh.

At his media press conference 

Monday, Harbaugh was asked 
about 
the 
performance 
of 

cornerback Lavert Hill. He said 
the sophomore had “asserted 
himself,” and was rewarded for 
his efforts with a pick-six that 
closed out Saturday’s win over 
Cincinnati.

But rather than stop there, 

Harbaugh kept naming players 
who had impressed him with 
their performances against the 
Bearcats.

The list went on and on. 

They all happened to play on 
the defensive side of the ball.

Junior safety Tyree Kinnel 

had a “spotlight” on him after 
a nod as the Big Ten Defensive 

Player of the Week for his 
team-high nine tackles and 
first career interception that 
he returned for a touchdown.

Sophomore end Rashan Gary 

had “one of his best games” 
with 
a 
three-tackle 
outing 

that was highlighted by a big 
hit on Cincinnati quarterback 
Hayden Moore in the fourth 
quarter. When the officials 
called a roughing the passer 
penalty and then reviewed 
the play for targeting, Gary 
got riled up on the field, and 
the Michigan Stadium crowd 
responded in kind.

“That was the loudest I’d 

heard it in a while,” Hurst said. 
“I think that was the loudest 
part of the game.”

Sophomore 
linebacker 

Devin Bush Jr. had “another 
big game” after tallying seven 
tackles, a sack and a pass break-

up. Hurst, for his own part, 
received the highest praise.

“(He) probably played the 

best of the up front defensive 
players,” Harbaugh said.

And that’s not even all of the 

players who received a mention. 
For a coach who usually keeps 
the details to himself, the 
gesture spoke volumes about 
the early success of his defense.

“(I) attribute that to hard 

work, good scheme and good 
players,” Harbaugh said.

While the Wolverine defense 

is trending upward, it will 
face a unique challenge when 
Michigan welcomes Air Force 
to Ann Arbor this week.

The Falcons frequently run 

a hybrid triple-option offense 
that almost no other team in 
the country does.

“They go back and forth 

between the conventional and 

the option,” Harbaugh said.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

aren’t 
particularly 
familiar 

with it, Hurst joked that he 
had some understanding of it 
because he sometimes played 
with the formation on the 
NCAA Football video game.

However, 
they 
spent 
a 

significant amount of spring 
camp ironing out a specific game 
plan to handle the challenge.

“We prepared a lot in the 

spring practices to get ready 
for what we’re going to face 
this week,” Hurst said. “So 
it’s not a complete shock to 
us. And I think we’ll be ready 
to have our scout team give 
us a look that we need — that 
they’ve been practicing and 
have done before — so I think 
that all helps you understand 
the offense better.”

While that experience could 

be helpful, Hurst admitted that 
there is still a lot Michigan’s 
defense will need to learn 
before Saturday.

“There’s a lot of things that 

go into it, and there’s a lot of 
people you have to account 
for in the option game,” Hurst 
said. “It’s just really tough for 
any defense to have to sort of 
switch what you’re doing on 
defense just to play this one 
week and then go back to a 
normal team.”

After such a strong start to 

the year, the Wolverine defense 
now has a new challenge to rise 
up to this week. If the offense 
and special teams units remain 
a work in progress, Michigan 
will need to lean on its defense 
to maintain its high level of 
play despite working out the 
kinks of a unique Air Force 
offense.
