The Board of Regents held 

its second meeting of the year 

remotely on Thursday to vote 

on 
firing 
David 
Daniels, 
a 

former Music, Theatre & Dance 

professor 
accused 
of 
sexual 

misconduct, 
and 
address 
the 

effects 
of 
the 
coronavirus 

outbreak 
on 
University 
of 

Michigan operations. All Regents 

and public commenters called in 

online and the meeting was live-

streamed.

Early in the meeting, University 

President Mark Schlissel asked 

the Board to take note of his 

recommendation 
to 
dismiss 

Daniels without severance for 

allegations of sexual misconduct. 

The Board voted unanimously 

to 
dismiss 
Daniels 
without 

severance.

“I 
have 
determined 
that 

Professor 
Daniels’ 
conduct 

is 
inconsistent 
with 
the 

character 
of 
tenure 
at 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
and 

therefore 
constitutes 
cause 

for dismissal,” Schlissel said. 

“I 
therefore 
recommend 
the 

dismissal of Professor Daniels 

from his tenured position at the 

University of Michigan, effective 

immediately.”

Daniels has been on leave from 

the University since allegations of 

sexual assault were made public 

in August 2018. A Michigan 

Daily investigation found that 

the University awarded Daniels 

tenure in May 2018 despite having 

knowledge of allegations against 

him. The University began the 

process of formally firing Daniels 

in July 2019.

A/PIA persons push for more data on community

Activists, experts urge ‘U’ to record more specific demographic categories of individuals for better representation

At a surface level, the Asian/

Pacific 
Islander 
American 

community is often seen as 

socioeconomically 
successful 

and having similar immigration 

and family histories, usually 

fitting into the “model minority” 

narrative. However, in the large 

APID/A community where some 

groups are overrepresented and 

others 
are 
underrepresented, 

some say issues of diversity 

and equity can be hidden with 

aggregated data. 

Mary Lai Rose, a Program 

Manager 
at 
the 
Office 
of 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 

and 
a 
Staff 
Co-Chair 
for 

the 
University’s 
APID/A 

Knowledge Community, said a 

lack of separated data hinders 

underrepresented groups from 

getting necessary resources and 

attention from the University of 

Michigan. 

“The groups that we know 

are underrepresented are all 

the ones that are not East Asian 

and are not South Asian, and 

even within South Asian there’s 

so much diversity,” Rose said. 

“People who come from lower 

income backgrounds within the 

APID/A community, Southeast 

Asian groups who have refugee 

histories, Pacific Islanders who 

have histories of colonization 

… the bottom line is that we 

are a very diverse group and 

I don’t know if the broader 

community and the University 

understands that and this is one 

way for us to help increase that 

understanding.”

Nandigama will serve as president 

and vice president of the University 

of 
Michigan 
Central 
Student 

Government’s 
10th 
Assembly, 

preliminary results from the March 

25-26 election show.

Kaplan and Nandigama ran with 

the party Mobilize, which endorsed 

candidates 
in 
the 
LSA, 
Public 

Health and Music, Theatre & Dance 

representative 
elections. 
Their 

platform focused on sustainability, 

affordability 
and 
accessibility, 

student wellness and preparing for 

the 2020 U.S. presidential debate 

being held on campus in October.

In their party profile, Kaplan and 

Nandigama said they wanted to make 

CSG more inclusive of other student 

groups to better understand the 

needs of students. The pair reiterated 

this goal and thanked voters in a 

statement to The Daily released early 

Friday morning following notification 

of their victory.

“We’re so grateful for all the 

support we’ve received over the past 

few weeks from our friends, family 

and campus community,” Kaplan 

and Nandigama wrote. “This has 

definitely been an unprecedented 

time on campus. However, we are 

both so excited to represent the 

student body in the upcoming school 

year and start working right away to 

advocate with and for students. We 

want to thank all of the candidates 

who so passionately advocated for the 

issues important to them and we look 

forward to working with students 

from across campus to make our 

collective Michigan experience even 

better.”

Among Kaplan and Nandigama’s 

large-scale goals are to ensure student 

wellness 
and 
safety, 
specifically 

in October when thousands will 

flock to Ann Arbor for the general 

presidential debate at the Crisler 

Center. Their platform also aligns 

with student activists’ goals when 

it comes to issues such as the One 

University campaign and climate 

action.

Their 
ideas 
in 
the 
area 
of 

accessibility and affordability include 

aiding students in their housing 

search through the creation of guides 

and pushing for more transparency 

from the Office of Financial Aid on 

deadlines and the cost of attendance.

Kaplan and Nandigama received 

1457 votes, 578 more than second-

place finishers Rackham student 

Austin Glass and LSA sophomore 

Megha Jain, who ran with Change at 

Michigan. One of Change’s main goals 

was to use CSG’s resources to better 

advocate on behalf of students to the 

University in areas such as carbon 

neutrality, sexual assault policies and 

diversity, equity and inclusion.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

As backpacking — the period when 

students select potential classes prior 

to officially registering — quickly 

approaches for the fall term, many 

students are awaiting their enrollment 

appointment time, which goes live 

on March 30 at 8 a.m. on Wolverine 

Access. Undergraduate students will 

receive an enrollment appointment 

that occurs somewhere between April 

6-17. 

Enrollment 
appointments 
are 

assigned based on the Credit Towards 

Program (CTP), which is a combination 

of credits earned at the University, 

credits from Advanced Placement or 

International Baccalaureate courses 

and transfer credits. Typically, juniors 

enroll before sophomores, who enroll 

before freshmen. However, many 

students matriculate at the University 

with a wealth of credits from AP or IB 

courses from high school. 

For students from under-resourced 

high schools with a limited number 

of AP or IB options, their enrollment 

appointments often come later, putting 

them at a disadvantage when choosing 

courses. Likewise for students who 

attended high school internationally 

whose advanced courses do not 

transfer to the University as college 

credit.

As a result, these students have 

to wait for their registration dates, 

hoping that enough room remains for 

them to enroll in classes required for 

their degrees. Once they are enrolled, 

they sometimes have to take more 

classes per semester to graduate at the 

same time as their peers because they 

were unable to transfer credits. 

LSA sophomore Alexis Irlbeck 

attended a high school that offered 

just one AP class traditionally, AP 

Literature and Composition. The 

course was only available to seniors 

considered “advanced” in English for 

two years. 

“My junior year, I was the pilot 

student for online AP classes, and 

they only let me take it to see how the 

workload would be,” Irlbeck said. “I 

succeeded in getting an A in the class 

and a 5 on the exam, so they opened 

up the program to a select few other 

TAG (Talented and Gifted) students, 

but we were still only allowed to 

take one AP class at a time. I took 

AP U.S. Government and Politics 

first semester of senior year and AP 

Microeconomics my second semester. 

I had never even heard of IB classes 

until I came to the University of 

Michigan.”

Often last in line to register, Irlbeck 

said she not only has a limited number 

of courses to choose from but has less 

flexibility in choosing what times 

she has class. She said this makes 

it difficult for her to find a balance 

between coursework and her various 

jobs on campus.

“There are some obvious downsides 

to being last in line to register, and 

those issues are compounded second 

semester of each year,” Irlbeck said. 

“This is because I have to leave either 

my Mondays or Fridays open until 1 

p.m. for one of my jobs. This is really 

difficult in and of itself, but then you 

add in the fact that I’m registering late 

anyways.”

Irlbeck is a double major in 

philosophy and economics. She said 

because late enrollment appointments 

have led to her making little progress 

toward either major, she must instead 

accommodate her schedule to focus 

on distribution requirements to still 

graduate on time. 

“I wasn’t able to take a single 

economics or philosophy course this 

semester, which is obviously very 

frustrating because I’m making zero 

progress towards my major,” Irlbeck 

said. “I decided to focus my efforts on 

my minor, and am taking two classes 

for that at the moment, as well as 

taking two other classes to fulfill my 

last two distribution requirements. 

I’m nervous that if this happens 

again next semester, I’ll have all my 

distribution credits taken care of 

and only two more classes left for my 

minor, so I’m not sure what I would 

do.”

Irlbeck said she understands the 

benefit of AP credit for many students 

but still feels that many students who 

didn’t have the opportunity to earn 

this credit are left behind when it 

comes to registration.

“On one hand, I understand how 

students who took AP courses, even 

if they don’t need them in college, 

want to be rewarded for their hard 

work by getting an earlier registration 

date,” Irlbeck said. “On the other 

hand, it’s incredibly unfair to students 

like myself who didn’t have the 

opportunity to load my high school 

schedule down with four AP classes 

for six semesters of high school.”

University 
spokesperson 
Rick 

Fitzgerald wrote in an email to The 

Daily that the CTP system is almost 

universal in higher education, though 

the University is constantly reviewing 

its procedures to ensure they are 

serving students well. He noted the 

University has received questions 

about the registration in the past.

“As students progress in their 

academic careers (i.e., advance from 

freshmen to sophomores to juniors to 

seniors), it’s important they be able to 

register for the classes they need to 

fulfill their graduation requirements,” 

Fitzgerald wrote. “When students are 

early in their academic careers, they 

have more options for taking various 

courses and electives and more time 

to get the classes they need.”

Engineering 
sophomore 
Maxim 

Hayes went to a high school that 

offered five AP classes total. Because 

multiple AP classes were scheduled 

in the same time slot, Hayes was only 

able to take two. As a computer science 

student, Hayes said he faces even 

more challenges with late registration 

dates as the department is known 

for its notoriously lengthy waitlists. 

Because of this, Hayes has ended up 

on the waitlist for the same course an 

entire year apart.

REGENTS
From Page 1A

Before 
voting 
to 
dismiss 

Daniels, the Regents allowed 

public commenters who signed 

up to comment on the motion to 

speak first. All three speakers 

spoke out against the charges 

against Daniels. 

Stephanie Blythe, professional 

opera singer, said students and 

colleagues have praised Daniels 

for supporting other artists and 

the University would be making a 

mistake by dismissing him.

“I ask the members of the Board 

of Regents to look at David Daniels 

as a separate entity from the well-

publicized difficult history the 

University has had with actual 

criminal acts in the recent past,” 

Blythe said. “Those acts should not 

cast a shadow on David’s case and I 

hope the University will recognize 

the distinction … The U of M 

family has a terrific opportunity 

here to rehabilitate a relationship 

with a wonderful teacher who 

can still be a credit to their legacy 

as well as his own. Please help to 

stop this reprehensible juggernaut 

of injustice, which is based on 

nothing but lies and deceit.”

Nicholas Phan, Music, Theatre 

and Dance alum and lyric tenor, 

also said the dismissal was part 

of a double standard applied to 

LGBTQ+ faculty members and 

criticized the rush to dismiss the 

tenured professor.

“There has been zero exploration 

of 
alternative 
possibilities 
or 

remedies,” Phan said. “It’s crystal 

clear why there is this discrepancy 

— Daniels is an openly gay man. 

In a moment where the #MeToo 

movement 
has 
made 
such 

important progress bringing light 

to hidden predatory behavior we 

cannot allow false allegations 

poisoned with homophobia to 

undermine these gains.”

Schlissel said he was grateful 

for how the University responded 

to rapid changes and adjustments 

in operations. In response to the 

spread of the coronavirus, Schlissel 

canceled all in-person classes on 

March 11 and shifted the University 

to remote learning formats online. 

Most University facilities have also 

reduced operations in accordance 

with Michigan Governor Gretchen 

Whitmer’s “Stay Home, Stay Safe” 

Executive Order since Monday, 

March 23. 

“While the pandemic has placed 

extraordinary demands on our 

community, the response of our 

community members has exceeded 

the extraordinary,” Schlissel said. 

“So I want to take time right now 

to thank the entire UM family - 

our students, faculty, staff and 

supporters, the UM parents that 

expressed 
their 
concern, 
not 

only for their children, but for 

all students. The faculty who 

moved to remote instruction in a 

matter of days, and have worked 

tirelessly to preserve or advance 

their research… and of course 

the health professionals on the 

front lines fighting this epidemic, 

and literally saving lives in our 

hospitals and clinics.”

Schlissel 
updated 
the 

community on the University’s 

response to COVID-19. According 

to Schlissel, Michigan Medicine 

launched in-house testing for the 

disease and the labs are processing 

results for up to 60 specimens with 

same-day results. These processes 

are increasing the number of 

patients that can be diagnosed, 

Schlissel said. 

Additionally, interns from the 

College of Pharmacy developed 

hand sanitizers for Michigan 

Medicine and Michigan Human 

Resources groups created special 

paid time off banks for employees 

affected by COVID-19.

Marschall 
Runge, 
executive 

vice president of medical affairs, 

dean of the medical school and 

CEO 
of 
Michigan 
Medicine, 

discussed the current status of 

patients at Michigan Medicine. 

As of Thursday, the facility had 

48 
COVID-19 
positive 
adult 

patients and no pediatric patients. 

They have 24 patients under 

investigation for possible COVID-

19 infection. Because of the rapid 

increase in patients, they are 

increasing capacity by postponing 

non-essential 
procedures. 

However, they also may need to 

use buildings on campus to treat 

non-critical COVID-19 patients. 

Schlissel commented on the 

news from earlier this week that 

WilmerHale, 
the 
independent 

law firm hired to investigate 

allegations of sexual misconduct 

against former Provost Martin 

Philbert, has also been hired to 

investigate the allegations against 

the late Robert Anderson, a former 

University athletic doctor.

“The change in firms will not 

in any way impede the ability to 

investigate what happened or 

compromise the independence of 

the investigation,” Schlissel said. 

“WilmerHale will produce a full 

accounting of the harms caused 

to former patients by Anderson 

as 
well 
as 
any 
institutional 

failings that allowed him to keep 

practicing, and that report will 

be issued to the public and the 

University simultaneously.”

The Board appointed Susan 

Collins, a professor of public policy 

and economics, as interim provost 

and executive vice president for 

academic affairs. It also approved 

two supplemental appointments: 

Rebecca Cunningham as vice 

president for research, who has 

been acting as the interim VP for 

the past year, and Martino Harmon 

as vice president for student life. 

Harmon is currently the senior 

vice president for student affairs 

at Iowa State University. 

Public Comments

Beyond 
the 
three 
public 

commenters who spoke in support 

of Daniels, five other individuals 

called in as well. They discussed 

an 
increased 
need 
for 
the 

University’s support for physician 

assistants at Michigan Medicine, 

inequities 
across 
the 
three 

University campuses and faults 

with the University’s method 

of communication for students 

living in University housing when 

classes shifted online.

Jill 
Hasen, 
committee 

chair of the United Physician 

Assistants of Michigan Medicine, 

spoke about how the group is 

seeking 
recognition 
from 
the 

University for the more than 350 

physician assistants at Michigan 

Medicine. She said the PAs are 

treated differently from nurse 

practitioners in terms of benefits, 

compensation and the ability to 

resolve workplace concerns in 

an orderly and systematic way 

despite the fact that the two 

positions often work closely with 

one another.

According to Hasen, UPAMM 

has been meeting with PAs within 

the institution for more than a 

year and has created a petition for 

union recognition that garnered 

support from the majority of PAs 

at Michigan Medicine. 

“Our mission is to represent, 

advocate 
and 
serve 
as 
the 

democratic voice for its members - 

physician’s assistants,” Hasen said. 

“Through collective bargaining, 

we will ensure high quality. We 

strive to achieve a fair work life 

balance, equity and transparency 

in a diverse, inclusive, safe and 

professional work environment. 

Together 
we 
see 
partnership 

with the university to contribute 

to Michigan Medicine’s highest 

standard of quality patient care.” 

Regents Mark Bernstein, Shauna 

Diggs and Paul Brown responded 

positively to Hasen’s comment, 

thanking her and all of her 

colleagues for their brave work on 

the front lines during the COVID-

19 pandemic. Bernstein expressed 

his support for their unionizing 

efforts and urged the University 

to codify a neutral position with 

respect to organizing.

“Speaking as an individual, 

I want you to know that I fully 

support your organizing efforts, 

and as I’ve said before … I also 

support the ability of all of our 

UM employees to determine and 

certify their bargaining unit in 

a way that enables workers to 

obtain the protection of collective 

bargaining,” Bernstein said. 

Alyssa Treviño, senior at U-M 

Flint and member of the One 

University campaign, explained 

the need for the board to focus 

on the U-M Flint and Dearborn 

campuses, especially now with the 

spread of COVID-19. She said the 

crisis has and will continue to have 

a large economic impact on these 

cities which will cause enrollment 

and retention to suffer.

“This is why now, more than 

ever, investment in the Flint and 

Dearborn 
campuses 
must 
be 

made,” Treviño said. “This is not an 

issue that can be set aside for later 

discussion, because it is ultimately 

tied with the situation at hand, and 

it is the responsibility of one of the 

wealthiest public institutions in 

the nation to support its mission of 

serving the residents of the state of 

Michigan.”

LSA freshman Dominic Coletti 

criticized the way the University 

Housing 
office 
communicated 

with students about adjustments 

in operations in response to the 

COVID-19 outbreak. Those who 

were still living in University 

housing received an email on 

March 17 asking students to justify 

their reasons for staying in under 

24 hours, leading many to believe 

they had to move out by the next 

morning. A follow-up email later 

clarified that students were not 

required to move out on March 18. 

“The 
simple 
lack 
of 

understanding, the tone of the 

email and how it would be read 

by students who are justifiably 

concerned 
about 
their 
living 

situation is irresponsible in a 

time of crisis,” Coletti said. “I 

would hope the University, in 

going forward, looks at every 

communication it sends out and 

ensures that every word, every 

phrase, every sentence is clear 

and provides the best possible 

guidance.”

A/PIA
From Page 1A

Groups like the APID/A (Asian 

Pacific Islander Desi /Americans) 

Knowledge Community, the United 

Asian 
American 
Organizations 

and Students in A/PIA Studies 

are pushing the University to 

disaggregate A/PIA data to better 

understand the demographics and 

diverse issues of subgroups within 

the A/PIA community at the 

University. When Asian American, 

Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 

data is disaggregated, it can make 

all the difference in allocating 

resources 
and 
representing 

subgroups 
within 
the 
A/PIA 

community, according to these 

groups.

Rose noted the disaggregation of 

A/PIA data is necessary to better 

understand 
more 
than 
ethnic 

diversity within the community. 

She said the data can help the 

University better allocate resources 

and outreach to subgroups of the 

community. 

“Our 
community 
is 
very 

diverse,” Rose said. “Because we 

fall under that one racial category, 

there are assumptions made about 

how monolithic or what a model 

minority this group is, but it’s 

actually very diverse … and it’s 

not just in terms of ethnicity and 

language. It’s also immigration 

histories, 
it’s 
citizenship, 

socioeconomic status.”

The 
APID/A 
Knowledge 

Community is a project funded 

by 
the 
National 
Center 
for 

Institutional Diversity with four 

goals: 
Examine 
institutional 

data on APID/A faculty, staff and 

students; 
evaluate 
the 
quality 

and collection of this data; make 

recommendations 
to 
improve 

data collection; and engage with 

the University community about 

these APID/A findings. The label 

“APID/A” was adopted to be more 

inclusive of the Desi community, 

Rose said.

Melissa 
Borja, 
an 
assistant 

professor of American Culture, 

said the disaggregation of APID/A 

data plays an important role in 

addressing needs of specific groups 

who are underrepresented in the 

APID/A community already. While 

many Asian Americans do suffer 

in terms of income, socioeconomic 

status and level of education, Borja 

said, these issues are masked 

by only having generalized data 

which shows higher than average 

education and income status for 

Asian Americans.

“We need to acknowledge that 

using a big category like ‘Asian 

American’ can really mask the 

fact 
that 
Hmong 
Americans, 

Cambodian 
Americans, 

Vietnamese Americans, they came 

to the United States in very different 

circumstances 
as 
refugees,” 

Borja said. “And as a result have 

had a very different experience 

economically in the United States. 

More recent immigrants from 

other countries, like Nepal and 

Burma, for example, have pretty 

high rates of poverty, and so having 

disaggregated data can help us be 

more responsive to the needs of 

particular communities.”

In a statement to The Daily, 

Robert Sellers, vice provost for 

Equity and Inclusion and chief 

diversity officer, said the University 

follows federal guidelines when 

it comes to collecting race and 

ethnicity data. 

“The 
university 
primarily 

collects and uses race/ethnicity 

data 
for 
reporting 
purposes 

and 
the 
federal 
government 

provides specific guidelines as 

to how the data is collected,” the 

statement reads. “The university 

has collected such data as part 

of our climate surveys. This data 

has disaggregated categories for 

race/ethnicity which will allow 

individuals to explore findings by 

subgroup. The data is available on 

university diversity, equity and 

inclusion website.” 

The 2016 DEI Climate Surveys 

sort all staff, faculty and students 

who are Asian/Asian American 

into one category and notably this 

category does not include the word 

“Pacific Islander.” While there 

are Native American and Native 

Alaskan categories, Pacific Islander 

is not one and there was no mention 

of Pacific Islanders throughout the 

report.

When 
summarizing 
findings, 

the overall results from the Asian/

Asian 
American 
category 
are 

discussed, but are not broken down 

into different ethnic categories 

which 
could 
individually 
have 

different results. 

According to Borja, the term 

“Asian American” was invented 

in the 1960s as an act of coalition 

building, but has since continued 

to be used and changed to be more 

inclusive of more communities. At 

the same time, she said, using the 

broad term “Asian American” has 

managed to conceal disparities 

between different subgroups and 

deeper issues about equity and 

inclusion. 

“In a specific University context, 

disaggregating the data can matter 

for curriculum, for programming, 

for resource allocation,” Borja said. 

“In general, it’s important for all of 

us to remember the instability of the 

category of ‘Asian American’ and 

the diversity within Asian America 

… I think disaggregating the data 

has significance in terms of policy 

and resource allocation, but also in 

terms of helping us understand who 

are Asian Americans in the first 

place, and reimagining who belongs 

to this particular community.”


P

olitical correctness culture 

threatens to permanently 

alter a comedy industry that 

has thrived on being unapologetically 

raw and brutally honest. Humor 

can only be achieved when there’s a 

kernel of truth behind the joke. My 

favorite author, George Orwell, was 

right when he said in 1945 that “every 

joke is a tiny revolution.” Jokes can be 

insensitive and still work when they 

expose a truth people are too polite 

or unwilling to admit. 

Best friends have the special 

privilege of being completely honest 

with each other. When people are 

close with one another, offense is 

rarely taken because they know 

each other’s intentions are good. 

The nature of comedy can enjoy this 

same privilege when it disregards 

societal boundaries — race, gender, 

age, etc. — and instills a sense of 

closeness among people to achieve 

humor rather than harm. When we 

let ourselves surrender to the horror 

that comics expose and choose to 

laugh rather than take offense, we 

learn something about hard-hitting 

subjects that might otherwise go 

unaddressed. 

We live in a world where self-

censorship is rampant due to what 

some would consider a highly 

“woke” (and what others would 

consider 
an 
offense-seeking) 

culture. Comedy may be the last 

form of interactive media where it is 

acceptable to be offensive, because 

jokes are designed to be taken with 

a grain of salt. By making offensive 

jokes, comedians are paradoxically 

able to dispel the notions that make 

them offensive. Successful comics 

can bond with people over what 

they know to be true rather than 

tearing people apart.

Famous comedians Judy Gold 

and Jerry Seinfeld have stopped 

performing on college campuses 

because they have to “omit any jokes 

from their routine which might 

offend a variety of protected classes.” 

According to Gold, “... you need to 

learn how to be in this world. The 

world doesn’t have to adjust for you.” 

Michael Moynihan, a reporter for 

Vice, interestingly notes, “the flawed 

logic of the ‘P.C. Police’: College 

students can’t be more diverse than 

ever yet all have the same monolithic 

opinion as to what is and isn’t 

funny.” We use cautionary devices 

in speech and behavior everyday 

so as to convey respect and avoid 

overstepping boundaries. Comedy 

breaks down these boundaries 

and demands that we ignore these 

barriers. In this way, comedy 

provides momentary bliss from the 

constant dance of tiptoeing around 

sensitive or controversial topics. 

Comics are constantly overstepping 

boundaries and pushing the envelope 

of what’s appropriate. 

The envelope can always be 

pushed too far, and some comedians 

voluntarily choose to steer clear 

of some topics. And colleges are 

allowed to make these decisions 

because they’re the ones paying for 

comedians to come to campus. But 

the problem with limiting what jokes 

comics can make is that it misses 

the whole point of comedy itself. 

Comedy challenges societal norms 

while demanding not to be taken 

critically. The best comics often 

shock us or make us uncomfortable 

(and probably should) right from 

the get go. And it is often the same 

insensitive jokes that make us uneasy 

that make us crack up in our seats. 

That’s because they reveal something 

about human nature that startles us, 

triggering a humorous effect. Bill 

Burr, in one of his standup routines, 

compares the experience a Black 

man has walking on the sidewalk 

to his own experience walking a 

pitbull on the sidewalk, noting how 

nice it is that everyone gets out of 

his way and that he doesn’t have to 

talk to anybody. These claims would 

obviously receive far more criticism 

if they were statements instead of 

jokes. He asserts some validity in 

these claims, but by arriving at these 

revelations through humor rather 

than fact, he is able to do so without 

necessarily causing harm or offense. 

Burr is a white guy making light of 

a racist situation. However, the goal 

of his joke isn’t to be discriminatory 

or racist but to point out that racism 

exists and to laugh at its absurdity. 

By making a joke about it, he breaks 

down the Black and white boundary 

and assumes he can laugh with Black 

people. This would be controversial 

in a regular scenario. In comedy, 

it works because comics blur the 

lines of identity repeatedly in order 

to connect with their audience on 

a raw, human level as opposed to 

everyday citizens. Michael Che, in 

his standup routines, makes fun of 

Muslim culture and suggests there 

is such thing as “thoughtful racism.” 

He justifies appreciating diversity by 

saying we need Black people because 

they “make shit cool,” white people 

because “you make shit safe” and 

Asian people because “they make 

shit affordable.” Che claims that 

assuming Black people like fried 

chicken and preparing it for them 

is not as bad as denying someone 

human rights based on skin color. 

He validates stereotypes in a joking 

manner and question how harmful 

different types of discrimination 

really are. The protective layer of 

lacking serious intent allows people 

to laugh without feeling shame. 

More 
importantly, 
these 
jokes 

make people contemplate serious 

issues without having to arrive at an 

affirmative conclusion or statement. 

Political satire is perhaps the 

most important form of comedy 

and should be protected at all costs. 

The Onion published a skit entitled 

“Trump Voter Feels Betrayed By 

President After Reading 800 Pages 

Of Queer Feminist Theory.” The 

funny video comments on the 

ridiculously 
high 
expectations 

college-educated 
liberals 
have 

about social awareness, political 

correctness and access to education 

and resources. It also seems to 

satirize conservatives who lack 

a general awareness about social 

inequities. 

I’ve touched on the pitfalls 

of political correctness before. 

Another one of P.C. culture’s 

limitations is that it makes people 

avoid hard – and often sensitive – 

topics for fear of criticism. Comedy 

needs to remain untouched by 

political 
correctness 
in 
order 

to address these topics. As a 

performative art, it is able to reveal 

some underlying truth without 

necessitating the claim to be 

accepted as whole. 

Comedy’s full transparency is 

a breath of fresh air in today’s day 

and age. While comedy’s nature 

demands light criticism, successful 

comics 
usually 
have 
good 

intentions. Jokes that are cruel 

to their core cease to be funny. At 

its purest form, comedy provides 

sharp relief from solemn life and 

frivolous sensitivities. When we 

allow it to, comedy lets us break 

down our walls and connect with 

one another as an audience. 

Life always runs the risk of 

being taken too seriously and in 

what is often a dark world, humor 

is vital to our sanity.

T

he 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

administration does not respect 

its students. In 1968, Robben 

Fleming was brought in as president of the 

University and was so celebrated in part 

because of his talent for handling the student-

administration relationship. Ironically, one 

year ago in the building named for Fleming, 

President Mark Schlissel had 10 protesters — 

asking for a public one-hour meeting about 

the University’s climate policy — arrested. 

This contrast shows how far the University’s 

respect for students has fallen. 

Students do not trust the current 

University administration. At the Dec. 5 

Regents Meeting, protesters condemned 

the Regents for failing to accept any of 

their demands after consistent, years-long 

advocacy. At the Jan. 20 Martin Luther King 

Jr. symposium, President Schlissel was met 

with a chorus of boos and the introduction 

video by the Stephen M. Ross School of 

Business was met with laughter. After 

President Fleming retired, student activists 

wrote about how much they respected him, 

despite their political disagreements. I doubt 

that would happen today. 

But this dynamic of mutual distrust and 

disrespect is not necessary. It is a natural 

consequence of a sprawling administrative 

structure that sidelines students at every 

turn. The University, and universities in 

general, systematically cut students out 

from important decision-making. They are 

undemocratic institutions. It’s time for that 

to change. 

In this article, I will focus on the ways 

the University is undemocratic, but I am 

sure this analysis could be similarly applied 

to hundreds of universities all around the 

country. I will also focus specifically on how 

students are cut out of decision-making, 

but this same logic applies to different 

constituencies I cannot speak to, including 

faculty, staff and communities from around 

Washtenaw County and Detroit; these groups 

are impacted by University policy, but do not 

have formal mechanisms of being included 

in decision-making. If universities support 

democracy, they should model it themselves. 

The University should lead the way in the 

movement to democratize universities.

The two ways in which students could 

be involved in University decision-making 

are by choosing the people who operate it or 

by being given power to set policy. We are 

currently afforded neither.

We do not have a direct say in choosing 

the people who run the University. The only 

elected officials at the University are the 

Board of Regents. However, Regents are 

elected in statewide elections where student 

voices are diluted and thus student concerns 

are not prioritized. When Regents are elected, 

there are no institutional mechanisms for 

holding them accountable. For example, in 

November 2018, Regents Paul Brown and 

Jordan Acker ran on transparency. A key 

element of that plan was to move Regents 

meetings from the inaccessible golf course 

back to campus, so that students could 

actually attend. But even a seemingly simple 

policy change like that has not happened 

almost a year and a half after their election. 

It is not entirely their fault; they are not paid 

for their labor, they have full-time jobs in 

addition to being Regents. I know things get 

dropped when people are busy, but it further 

shows that changing the University by 

electing better Regents is futile.

The Regents’ limited capacity shows 

that the real power lies in the President’s 

office and the University administrators 

— individuals we have almost no say in 

selecting. This is, in part, thanks to the 

archaic culture of academia where it is taboo 

for administrators to be seen looking for 

new jobs. But it is also because the Michigan 

Supreme Court ruled that public universities 

could hold interviews for presidents behind 

closed doors. Although some schools have 

decided to make their selection processes 

more transparent, the University did not in 

either the appointment of former President 

Mary Sue Coleman or President Schlissel. 

Furthermore, the student body has no formal 

input into any administrative appointments 

within the President’s office. Consider the 

ongoing search to select a new Provost. How 

is that position being selected? Who is being 

considered? These are decisions that have 

enormous impacts on students, but we have 

no say.

Even though students have no power in 

choosing who runs the University, we still 

try to reform the University on the issues 

we care about. However, when we do so, 

we are brushed aside and told to listen to 

the unelected officials we are supposed to 

trust. Yet, they have not earned our trust. 

When students use the pitiful institutional 

mechanisms afforded to them to create 

change, nothing happens. One obvious case 

is the endowment, the $12.4 billion fund 

that financially supports the University. 

Ideologically, the University believes we 

are not qualified to have any say in how it is 

invested, even though our tuition supports it. 

And the University is supposed to serve us. 

When The Michigan Daily asked President 

Schlissel if “the University should work to 

incorporate the beliefs of the student body 

in its investments,” he responded with an 

unequivocal “no.” 

This extends to specific issues as well. 

When the Students Allied for Freedom and 

Equality (SAFE) passed a resolution calling 

for the University to create a committee 

to investigate divestment from companies 

operating in the occupied Palestine through 

the Central Student Government (CSG), the 

University dismissed it out of hand. In the 

current fossil fuel divestment campaign, 

the Association of Big Ten Students (ABTS) 

— the coalition of student body presidents 

representing each school in the Big Ten — 

passed a resolution calling on their respective 

institutions to immediately freeze fossil fuel 

investments and move toward divestment. 

The University froze its investments after 

further pressure from students, but still, 

the other 13 Big Ten schools have not frozen 

investments and none of the Big Ten schools 

have made moves toward divestment. 

Even when students use the most powerful 

institutions we have to make change within 

universities, nothing happens.

One reason the University seems to cut 

out students from decision-making is that the 

administration does not think we are capable 

of acting for the common good. The Graduate 

Employees Organization’s (GEO) experience 

bargaining with the University has made this 

crystal clear. GEO, the union representing 

graduate workers at the University, is 

bargaining for the common good, meaning 

that in addition to main issues like higher 

wages and better health care, they are using 

their stature within the University to try to 

get the University to address Washtenaw 

County’s housing crisis and demilitarize the 

campus policy — issues that impact everyone. 

But Human Resources has deemed these 

issues permissible, meaning that they don’t 

have to bargain over them. Instead, they offer 

still higher wages, demonstrating that the 

University believes students cannot act in 

the best interests of the community, only for 

themselves.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Video Game Music: A new world we can escape to

I played video games as much as any 

other kid growing up in the GameCube 

era. My earliest memories of video 

game music come from playing “Sonic 

Adventure 2” on the Dreamcast, 

where you could listen to the original 

soundtrack from an extras menu. I was 

particularly fond of the hip-hop songs 

that played during the Knuckles stages; 

God only knows how many times I 

listened to the Pumpkin Hill theme 

song.

I hadn’t thought all that much about 

video game music since then, until last 

year. For years I had been a champion of 

“lo-fi beats to relax and study to” when 

I needed to wind down, but lo-fi beats 

just weren’t doing it for me anymore. 

Still, I craved that sense of comfort 

lo-fi beats evoked. I started listening 

to hybrid video-game-lo-fi beats like 

“Zelda & Chill.” Eventually that turned 

into straight video game playlists, like 

“Relaxing and Calming Music from 

Chrono series.” YouTube’s suggested 

video algorithm went to work, and 

before I knew it, I had a beloved rotation 

of video game soundtracks and music 

compilations.

To this day I can’t remember a single 

stand-out song from any of the lo-fi 

beats playlists I once cherished, but the 

melodies of numerous video games I’ve 

never even played somehow managed 

to fill up filing cabinets in my brain. In 

past times of stress and anxiety, I’ve 

turned to video games to escape and 

I’ve turned to music to escape. But 

now, in a present time of great stress 

and anxiety, I turn to a combination of 

both — I find myself wanting to escape 

into those filing cabinets of video game 

music.

Does that make video game music 

one of the greatest forms of escapism?

Video game music, or VGM, is music 

found in video games. When people 

think of VGM, they often think of the 

chiptune music of the original “Super 

Mario Bros.” — the song’s Wikipedia 

page actually cites a 2001 article written 

by Daily Arts Editors who claimed, 

“Ask a random student to hum the 

theme to the classic game and chances 

are they’ll know every note.” But VGM 

is also the opening theme to “Call of 

Duty: Modern Warfare 2” composed by 

Hans Zimmer himself, and the licensed 

3rd-party music for games like Guitar 

Hero or Dance Dance Revolution.

VGM is not a genre; it’s something 

bigger than a genre. There’s something 

about it that sets it apart. One of the 

most popular videos by YouTube user 

Seth Everman is “music genre: video 

game,” in which Everman improvises 

tunes reminiscent of VGM. “He 

somehow made this sound like every 

game and no game at the same time,” 

one user commented. “why do I feel 

nostalgic for a game that doesn’t exist” 

another user commented on a sequel 

video. So if VGM isn’t a genre, what 

separates it from other types of music?

I continued exploring video 

game 
music 
on 
YouTube, 

looking for an answer to that 

question. Soon I discovered 

the website was home to an 

enormous community of VGM 

fans. Compilations like the ones 

I listened to were big; VGM 

cover artists were even bigger. 

The first VGM cover to catch 

my eye was a video of two dudes 

on the street in Melbourne 

doing a batshit insane cover 

of the Gerudo Valley theme from The 

Legend of Zelda. Equally impressive is 

the work of full-time cover artists like 

Smooth McGroove, one of the most 

well known artists for his acappella 

rearrangements of VGM classics.

YouTube user Vapidbobcat, who 

requested anonymity for this article, 

started making video game music 

compilations in late 2015, and has since 

built his channel up to over 30 thousand 

subscribers. 

“I’ve always had the habit of keeping 

a copy of my favorite songs from each 

video game I play, and over the years 

that has resulted in me having a pretty 

big library of music,” Vapidbobcat 

wrote in an email interview with The 

Michigan Daily. “That is likely a big 

reason why I’ve been able to do this for 

so long without running out of ideas.”

Vapidbobcat’s VGM playlists tap 

into the versatility of video game 

soundtracks by crafting a specific 

aesthetic. Often these are seasonally 

themed, like winter or holiday music; 

other times they’re more novel, like 

“Nintendo elevator music.”

“In some cases it is easy, like, if I’m 

doing a fire-themed compilation, then I 

just need to go over as many fire levels 

as I can and see what music plays in 

them,” Vapidbobcat explained. “But 

sometimes I like to try my hand at more 

‘abstract’ themes, and in this situation I 

simply take a look at what feelings I’m 

trying to convey, and what video game 

songs are good at conveying that feeling 

(in my opinion).”

A community of fans loves and 

appreciates the work that Vapidbobcat 

puts into his VGM compilations. On 

a relaxing spring-themed collection 

uploaded 
last 
week, 
many 
fans 

expressed gratitude for a moment of 

peace amid a pandemic. “thank u vapid 

for making my quarantine as peaceful 

and beautiful as possible,” one user 

commented. “In a time of crisis and 

isolation we need your videos even 

more,” another said.

Vapidbobcat is in tune with his 

fans: The words he shared with me 

only a few days earlier, right before the 

coronavirus panic dug its claws into 

Michigan, echoed their sentiments. 

“A lot of people enjoy video game 

music because it helps them cope with 

stressful 
situations,” 
Vapidbobcat 

wrote to me. “It reminds them of a time 

where they had no worries in life.” I can 

relate to that.

VGM has the power to transport 

listeners to another world in a way 

that’s unique from other types of music. 

It can transport listeners to the world of 

a video game, or the world of VGM on 

YouTube, a world where fans can find 

community through cool covers and 

compilations. But the VGM community 

isn’t just online — it’s right here at the 

University of Michigan.

At Festifall my sophomore year, 

before my appreciation for video game 

music blossomed, I stopped by a booth 

for Video Game Music Club, or VGMC, 

and signed up for the mailing list on a 

whim. I never made it past the mass 

meeting, but I saw a club buzzing with 

activity. Topics ranged from breaking 

down the appeal of Wii menu music to 

learning to make your own video game 

music. VGMC is a unique space for 

VGM appreciation on campus, uniting 

video game fans, cover artists and even 

aspiring composers.

The weekend after 

classes 
were 
moved 

online, I walked into 

East Quad to the tune of 

a somber piano echoing 

through the halls. It was 

a gorgeous melody, but 

somewhat sad, a fitting 

backdrop to the scores 

of students pushing blue 

bins and packing cars 

to leave campus. At the 

helm of the piano was 

VGMC president and LSA senior Ajilan 

Potter. The melancholic tune I caught 

was “H’aanit’s Theme” from “Octopath 

Traveler,” transitioning into an original 

composition that Potter was working 

on.

VGMC started in Winter 2018, when 

Potter was trying to get a band together 

to do VGM covers and jams. In light of 

complex logistics for starting a band 

— like finding a rehearsal space on a 

campus where recreational space is 

tight — Potter decided to start a club 

for the time being. But that niche has a 

growing audience.

“It started out really small, five 

to ten people every week … now we 

consistently have between ten, 15, 20 

people,” Potter said in an interview 

with The Michigan Daily. “Sometimes 

the whole room is full depending on 

what we’re talking about.”

Potter is an artist of many mediums: 

On top of founding VGMC, he’s a 3D 

modeler, a writer with two finished 

manuscripts under his belt and a self-

taught musician. Video game music is 

what led Potter to pick up the piano. 

“When I played ‘Final Fantasy 

XIII’ … I was just blown away by the 

soundtrack,” Potter said. “I think that 

was the first time I was consciously 

like, ‘I don’t just like this, I love this … I 

started learning piano from listening to 

those piano collections … I couldn’t live 

without at least trying to play it.”

Now, Potter is building a community 

around video game music at the 

University through VGMC. The club’s 

focus has shifted semester to semester 

based on what the members want; last 

year was a lot of VGM composition, 

and this year has been a lot of VGM 

appreciation. Whether it’s composition 

or appreciation, a space like this for 

VGM is hard to find. The University 

offers a popular class on video game 

music through the School of Music, 

Theatre & Dance, but it’s hard to get 

into, and it’s only a VGM community for 

a single semester. That makes VGMC a 

rare sanctuary for VGM enthusiasts on 

campus. For some members, the club 

has even been a launchpad to work on 

their own VGM projects.

VGM has power that goes beyond 

nostalgia. Like myself, Potter and 

Vapidbobcat both appreciate music 

from games that they’ve never played. 

What makes this music so sticky, so 

memorable in a way that ChilledCow’s 

lo-fi beats never were for me?

One 
key 
difference 
is 
the 

compositional 
brilliance 
behind 

game companies like Nintendo. It’s 

easy to think VGM is just background 

music; when tied to an interactive 

experience like a video game, it’s 

logical to assume music is secondary 

to the game’s journey. But VGM is 

it’s own journey. Composers employ 

musical techniques to build a specific 

mood or even form a sonic narrative 

complete with action, climax and 

resolution.

But now, in a present time of great 

stress and anxiety, I turn to a

TV REVIEW
In ‘Westworld’, Aaron Paul reveals a not-too-distant future

Well, it’s here folks: The robots 

are out of the park. Season three of 

“Westworld” brings the promise of a 

host takeover through the ringleader 

of our army of artificial intelligence, 

Delores Abernathy (Evan Rachel Wood, 

“True Blood”). She claims she wants 

to rule the human world, which, for 

all its futuristic luxury, still has lots of 

problems. After being locked into the 

perspective of those in the parks for the 

past two seasons, the expanded setting 

of season three makes it easier to see the 

societal issues that permeate through a 

future of touchscreens, home artificial 

intelligence and self-driving cars.

After being framed as a scapegoat 

for the Westworld massacre in season 

one, our de facto protagonist, Bernard 

(Jeffrey Wright, “The Goldfinch”), is 

hiding. He works at a meat packing 

factory in Southeast Asia. In his free 

time, he has engineered a means to 

better control his computer alter-ego 

with the touch of a button. While the rest 

of the world is unaware that he is also a 

host, he tries to find a way to return 

to the park in order to prevent further 

destruction. As he works and lives, we 

can see how severely underdeveloped 

some areas of the world remain despite 

the highly advanced technologies that 

exist in American society. 

The dystopian class-divide is depicted 

most clearly through the storyline of 

Caleb, played by the brilliant Aaron 

Paul (“Breaking Bad”). “Sometimes it 

seems like the world looks alright. They 

put a coat of paint on it,” he says to his 

therapist, “but on the inside it’s rotting 

to pieces.” As a construction worker, 

Caleb helps build the many elegant 

skyscrapers that adorn Los Angeles. As 

an ex-soldier Caleb is still mourning the 

loss of his fallen comrade. He can’t seem 

to catch a break as he constantly tries 

to secure a job above his class standing. 

In one particular scene, Caleb receives 

a call informing him he’s been turned 

down. After politely asking where else 

he might be able to apply, he realizes he’s 

only talking to an automated voice on the 

other end. This constant rejection forces 

Caleb to routinely turn to petty crime to 

manage his lack of control over his life. 

Surrounded 
by 
the 
pervasive 

affluence of the future, the addition of 

Caleb’s perspective to the story gives 

a better idea of civilians who may 

be considered “low-lifes” within the 

narrative. In classic Aaron Paul fashion, 

a lowly character is used to give us more 

understanding as to why Westworld 

was built in the first place. In an age 

where computers dominate over human 

freedom, it would seem therapeutic 

to assert your power over a bunch of 

robots in a controlled environment. His 

presence also guarantees an inevitable 

interaction with the hosts, which 

will prove to be intriguing from the 

perspective of someone who has never 

had the means to set foot inside the 

park’s premises.

One of the most delicate elements 

of 
“Westworld” 
continues 
to 

be 
the 
carefully 
placed 
musical 

accompaniment. Our ears bounce from 

hurried electro-funk beats during action 

sequences to slower piano riffs during 

scenes of contemplation and character 

intimacy. The image of the scripted, 

self-playing piano lingers from the first-

season as Delores slowly leads the hosts 

to break free from the coded scripts they 

have been imprisoned by.

The newest season of “Westworld” 

proves 

it

When 
I 
applied 
to 
write 
the 

entertainment column three years ago, 

my pitch was that most of my articles 

would focus on what I considered a 

modern day Hollywood concept of the 

“never ending story.” Any storyteller 

will tell you that the ending of a story is 

what gives it its meaning, and I’ve spent 

thousands of words over the past few 

years talking about what it means for our 

collective storytelling consciousness that 

nowadays money dictates that stories 

cannot end. “Harry Potter,” “Star Wars,” 

“Avengers,” none of these stories are 

allowed to end. They must continue on in 

some fashion or another as long as they’re 

still helping the company’s bottom line. 

But there’s another type of story I’ve 

neglected through all of this. The story 

that never gets an ending because it’s cut 

short before its time had come. The story 

that ends on a cliffhanger, on unanswered 

questions, 
without 
the 
catharsis 
of 

conclusion, and with characters yet to 

complete their arcs. But for those of us 

who were to graduate in the calendar 

year of 2020, this isn’t just a story, it’s 

the brutal reality of what our college 

experience has become.

Like all seniors, and like the many who 

have already written articles in the Daily 

on this subject, I’ve struggled to come 

to terms with the abrupt cancellation of 

senior spring. Friends left before I had a 

chance to say goodbye. Club projects and 

events were over before they had even 

started. Team’s seasons were cut short, 

and the idea of celebrating the past four 

years faded away into an abyss of news 

stories about a terrifying global pandemic. 

As I wrote above, I’ve long argued stories 

don’t have meanings without endings, so 

do the past four years of my life not have 

a meaning either? Of course not, and so I 

am left to admit what should have been 

obvious to me all along. As a wise man 

once said, “The world isn’t divided into 

good people and death eaters.” Or in other 

words, “stories aren’t divided into those 

with endings (and therefore meanings) 

and those without.” 

In the final episode of “Lost”, Jack 

Shepherd discovers he’s dead and turns 

to his father in the afterlife, asking him 

“Did I matter?” His father responds with 

one of the thesis statements of the series, 

one that people who wanted the finale to 

be an all-encompassing source of answers 

have struggled with. “You mattered, 

everything that’s ever happened to you 

has mattered, and the most important 

part of your life was the time you spent 

with these people.” Jack’s father is 

talking about the other characters on the 

show, but the same idea can be applied 

to any group of people who share a set 

of experiences. I know there are many 

who walk the graduation stage and 

feel an immense sense of achievement 

in the courses they have taken, the 

journey they’ve gone on, the personal 

accomplishment of getting a degree from 

this fine University. I totally understand 

that. But for me the celebration would 

always have been mainly about the 

people. A last chance to make the rounds 

and celebrate all the wonderful people I 

came to know and love during my time at 

this school. 

There’s something about a global 

pandemic that really brings home the fact 

that so many of the petty disputes and 

simple problems we distract ourselves 

with everyday don’t really matter in the 

grand scheme of things. When faced with 

an existential threat, you’re made aware 

with absolute clarity about who the most 

important people in your life are and why. 

The people you have around you, the ones 

you stay in contact with from far away, 

the ones you love, the ones who make you 

laugh, who share your stories, who are a 

part of your stories, and you theirs, those 

are the only things that really matter in 

this life. Everything else is immaterial 

at best, and a distraction from the simple 

miracle of human connection at worst. 

There’s a quote that some in my family 

attribute to my Great Aunt Harriett that 

goes like this, “In the end, only three 

things matter: how much you loved, how 

gently you lived, and how gracefully 

you let go of things not meant for you.” 

Upon a simple Google search I’ve found 

it’s actually a Buddha quote. Go figure. 

Members of the class of 2020, graduation 

and senior spring were not meant for us. 

But that fact shouldn’t make us think any 

less of what we achieved during our time 

here. We saw a dog almost get elected 

CSG president. We saw a buzzer beater to 

send the basketball team to the sweet 16 

and eventually the final four. Once upon 

a time, we still had Michigan Time. And 

like Michigan Time, our time at Michigan 

has come to a close sooner than we would 

have liked, but that will never change the 

meaning of the past four years. A thing 

isn’t beautiful because it lasts. 

Forever and always, go blue.

Entertainment Column: 

On a story cut short

IAN HARRIS

Daily Entertainment Columnist

For most people, the stages of quarantine have 

gone something along these lines: anger about being 

stuck inside all day, acceptance that quarantine is 

a necessary measure, militance in making sure 

that everyone follows the rules, confusion as to 

what to do with all this free time and resignation 

that quarantine is going to last a whole lot longer 

than anticipated. If your quarantine hasn’t gone 

down this way, you haven’t been adhering to social 

distancing and isolation measures, which is wack, 

and you will therefore be considered a buster. All of 

these emotions and feelings culminate in what will 

be known as the “quarantine blues” from here on 

out. As a way to combat the quarantine blues, I’ve 

thrown together a quick playlist composed of songs 

that I enjoy and feel embody the process of going 

through the quarantine blues.

It all starts with Suicidal Tendencies’ 

“Institutionalized.” Singer Mike Muir’s palpable 

anger is bound to resonate with anyone upset 

about the forced quarantine, even though it’s 

what’s best for everyone. Next, “Counting Days” 

by The Fight and “Army of One” by Drain are 

two hardcore shitkickers that take listeners 

toward acceptance as they count the days and 

slowly begin to understand that the fight against 

the virus starts with you, an army of one. Pop 

Smoke’s “Get Back” and Lil Uzi Vert’s “You 

Better Move” usher in the phase of enforcing 

the militant sanitary standards that are needed 

to keep every at-risk person healthy. “Don’t 

Call Me” by Young Thug carries this militant 

attitude toward social distancing, but he does so 

in a pensive, conflicted tone. The next two songs, 

“Where Do I Go (Bbq Music)” by Max B and “I 

Think I’ll Just Stay Here and Drink” by Merle 

Haggard, both realize that all we can do is stay 

home and stay safe, though all we want to do 

is literally anything else. “I’m Not That Lonely 

Yet” by Reba McEntire and “A Country Boy 

Can Survive” by Hank Williams Jr. transform 

the confusion into resignation that we’re stuck 

in quarantine and there’s nothing we can do 

about it, but we’ll make it through (eventually). 

The last song, “Good Times” by Eric Burdon, 

serves as a bonus track of sorts, something of 

a final reminder to everyone to use their time 

wisely in quarantine. That is to say, make sure 

you’re doing exactly what you want to be doing, 

whether it’s being productive, chatting on the 

phone, reading a book or drinking a couple beers 

while watching TV.

— Jim Wilson, Daily Arts Writer

Most notable to me during this quarantine: 

the building blocks of my conversations have 

vastly changed. I’ve been asking my pals for one 

word to describe how they’re feeling (a support 

group tactic, perhaps) and I’ve been leaning on 

metaphors heavily. My pals and I metaphorize 

the waves of quarantine: We talk of feeling like 

sedimentary rocks, losing their sediments (ha), 

of how the days feel like getting on a roller coaster 

(when “I’m okay” suddenly turns to “get me the 

fuck out,” then you’re off the ride, feeling all bad-

tempered, until you grab some carnival food and 

the cold-sweat is gone). I told another friend of 

the candle-girl-metaphor I’ve been utilizing. I 

see how much progress the candle makes, as a 

way to keep track of the time. Like tallies on the 

wall. Like watching paint dry, but better. 

To me, that’s the primary component of 

playlists: making metaphors. These quarantine 

playlists feel like a ton of metaphors to try out, 

trying to find enough representations of and 

deep dives into the moods you’ve lost or the 

moods you think you need. 

And so in my metaphor campaign, I keep 

coming back to “Aquemini” by Outkast, the intro 

of my quarantine playlist:

“Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually 

die / Horoscopes often lie and sometimes “y” / 

Nothin’ is for sure, nothin’ is for certain, nothin’ 

lasts forever / But until they close the curtain / 

It’s him and I Aquemini”

No one was expecting this. Josh Peck’s 

armpits are sweaty because the forecasts have 

lied; quarantine is not an A, E, I, O, or U situation, 

it’s a sometimes Y, it’s maybes and uncertainties. 

But through it all, there’s a team effort. It’s Andre 

and Big Boi till the end, and it’s me and my pals 

til the end, because who else would we share our 

metaphors with, and send our playlists to? 

— Sam Cantie, Music Beat Editor 

This playlist is not full of cheesy tunes like 

“Don’t Stand So Close to Me,” but rather the 

songs that creep up on you when you’re alone, 

when the Netflix show you’ve been binging 

fades out at 3 a.m. and your half-awake face 

shines back in the darkened computer screen. 

Yeah, these are the isolation blues, baby. Stuck 

inside our houses, things can get a little bit 

foggy, so let this mix guide you through the blur 

as easily as a thumping bass line or a synthy 

undertone seems to weave its way through good 

music. With a sprinkling of psychedelia, folk, 

jazz, soft rock and everything in between, the 

same atmosphere of vibey lethargy is present in 

each song on this playlist. It’s good for throwing 

on at the end of the night, while you attempt to 

bake bread for the twentieth time or even dance 

by yourself trying to shake away some of that 

social distancing delirium. Let it play on … this is 

not the time for shuffling.

— Clara Scott, Daily Arts Writer

“It’s a reference to — ”

“‘The Lighthouse.’ I know. I looked it up,” I 

said, cutting him off, knowing he would laugh.

I was on the phone with a friend whose 

parents had whisked him off campus with little 

notice earlier that week (not an uncommon 

practice these days, but everything has this way 

of feeling both blindsiding and maddeningly 

feasible). He had proposed we do weekly phone 

calls, and I was grateful; this was our first one. 

We were talking about our quarantine playlists, 

his most recent quoting a line from Willem 

Dafoe, as I learned by googling the title of his 

playlist.

I could decrypt almost anyone’s Spotify 

playlist like this (routinely, I scroll through 

the Friend Activity sidebar, especially when 

I try to feel less alone), but he’s one of few I’m 

open about that with. He knows it’s an odd 

but well-intentioned display of attention and 

camaraderie, but also a game. I think we both 

need it right now, to say I’m still me, you’re still 

you — not everything has to come to a screeching 

halt.

In the same phone call, I mentioned something 

I’d been trying lately: bookending playlists with 

disparate tracks by the same artist. One such 

post-quarantine playlist of mine, called “Wake 

up in this comic book, plant forsythias,” is an 

example. It starts with Rodriguez’s melancholy 

but relevant “Cause” (the final line of which 

inspired the title), and concludes with the more 

lilting, sarcastic but varying “Jane S. Piddy.” In 

between, you’ll find hopeful peaks — like The 

Monkees’ “Me & Magdalena” — and dips — like 

Damien Jurado’s “Everything Trying.” Much 

like my days, my moods, under this quarantine.

“One of these days I’m going to make a playlist 

you can’t decode.”

I smile, say yes, welcoming the challenge, our 

game, the continuity, the comfort of knowing 

someone and being known.

the past four years

‘That was it’: Inside the moment ‘M’ found out its season was over

The 
Michigan 
hockey 

team was still on the ice 

when 
the 
decision 
was 

made, practicing for a Big 

Ten Tournament semifinal 

game that ultimately would 

never be played.

At 
that 
point, 
the 

Wolverines were unaware 

of the specifics but deeply 

aware of the possibility. 

They knew what was likely 

coming. They just didn’t 

know when. 

On 
that 

Thursday — 

March 
12, 

just over two 

weeks ago — 

Mel Pearson 

was on the 

ice running 

practice 

when 
he 

received 
word 
that 
he 

needed to be on a conference 

call at 3 p.m. He left the ice 

and headed straight upstairs 

to his office.

Pearson told the team 

they’d meet at 4 p.m. when 

he was done with the call 

and 
after 
they 
finished 

practice. He didn’t yet know 

the extent of what he’d have 

to tell them, though he had 

an inkling.

“I 
think 
we 
had 
all 

braced ourselves a little 

bit,” Pearson said. “Earlier 

in the day, we watched 

the basketball team come 

out (for its first Big Ten 

Tournament game) and then 

get whisked off and that 

was it. The night before, 

I’d watched the NBA stuff. 

Things were starting to 

happen real quick, so I think 

our guys had a little sense.”

While his team practiced 

one floor below, Pearson sat 

on a conference call with 

Athletic 
Director 
Warde 

Manuel 

and 
all 
of 

Michigan’s 

head coaches. 

Manuel, 

who had told 

the 
men’s 

basketball 

team 
the 

Big 
Ten 

Tournament 

was canceled earlier in the 

day, laid out the rapidly 

developing situation with 

COVID-19 and explained 

the Big Ten’s decisions. 

“Warde Manuel let us 

know what was going down 

as far as they’re suspending 

all Big Ten play,” Pearson 

said. 
“And 
essentially, 

the Big Ten had also said 

even if there is an NCAA 

Tournament at this point, 

the Big Ten was not going to 

participate. That was it.”

That announcement came 

at about 3:15 p.m. The call 

continued right up until 

Pearson had to go into the 

locker room and tell his 

team the news.

The 
players 
had 
all 

showered and dressed after 

finishing practice and were 

ready to meet, then continue 

on 
with 
their 
normal 

routine. They still didn’t 

fully know what Pearson 

was about to tell them. 

They didn’t know that their 

normal, for all intents and 

purposes, was gone.

Pearson 
remembers 

still having his skates on 

when he walked into the 

locker 
room. 
Everything 

happened so quickly that 

he didn’t have time to take 

them off between practice, 

the conference call and the 

team meeting.

“When we told them, it 

was really hard to tell them 

and to look them in the eye, 

especially 
the 
seniors,” 

Pearson said. “Just basically 

tell them, ‘Hey, we’re done.’ 

Just the starkness of it. The 

raw words that come out 

like, ‘Season over. We’re 

done.’ ”

Michigan was one of the 

hottest teams in the country 

in the second half of the year, 

notching an 11-3-2 record 

and finishing No. 14 in the 

Pairwise — a ranking that 

had them in contention for 

an at-large bid to the NCAA 

Tournament, 
something 

that 
seemed 
like 
an 

impossibility in November. 

The Wolverines moved in 

the Pairwise more than any 

other team in the country in 

the second half, up 22 spots 

between Dec. 26 and March 

1, and rose even more after 

sweeping Michigan State 

in the first round of the Big 

Ten Tournament.

In short, they were ready 

for an NCAA Tournament 

run. Then, in one fell swoop, 

it was all over.

“It 
was 
emotional,” 

Pearson said. “It was really 

hard. I’ve been in games, 

lost a national championship 

game in overtime and you 

have to go in the locker 

room and look at your guys, 

and that’s hard, but at least 

you had the opportunity. 

You gave it everything you 

had. You left it all out on the 

ice. Here, it’s like you never 

got that chance to finish 

what you started.

“ ... We just had that 

hope we could get into 

the tournament. We were 

right there. Then you have 

a chance. Then all bets are 

off. And we had a group that 

could do it.”

Now, the players have 

scattered 
back 
to 
their 

hometowns, 
with 
just 

four or five still in Ann 

Arbor. The last time they 

all gathered together was 

in that locker room, the 

moment Pearson told them 

they were done.

“At that point, we just 

thanked them, told them we 

loved them, how we felt for 

them,” Pearson said. “But 

no words that I was going 

to tell them were going 

to make it feel any better. 

It’s just something that 

hopefully, over time, they’ll 

heal from.”

ALEC COHEN/Daily

The Michigan hockey team found out its season was over after a Big Ten conference call on March 12.

You never got 
that chance to 
finish what you 

started.

A series of unnecessary questions: Getting to know the Wolverines

After 32 games and five 

months on a beat, you learn a 

lot about a team. What plays 

they run, what the rotation 

is, what their strengths and 

weaknesses are and even who 

the mom of the team is — senior 

guard Akienreh Johnson.

The things you really want 

to know, though, can’t be 

figured out by simply watching 

the team. Instead, you’ve got 

to rely on awkward-looking 

19 year-olds to ask those 

questions for you. So now, what 

originally began as a podcast 

gag and quickly turned into 

crowdsourcing for new meals I 

can make at college, will come 

to you in a written format. I 

apologize in advance. 

***

Favorite ice cream:

Freshman 
guard 
Maddie 

Nolan: 
Something 
called 

“yellow cake batter.” At first 

we doubted its existence, but a 

thorough investigation yielded 

multiple 
other 
witnesses 

coming forward and testifying 

to its existence.

Freshman guard Michelle 

Sidor: Mint chocolate chip. She 

actually said, “chocolate chip 

mint,” but the only ice cream I 

found that’s called that is from 

a company called Cascade 

Glacier in Oregon, and I had to 

go to the third page of Google 

for that — just to find out it’s 

the exact same thing as mint 

chocolate chip.

Johnson: Butter pecan. 

Freshman 
center 
Izabel 

Varejão: Salted caramel.

Favorite Christmas songs:

Sophomore 
forward 
Naz 

Hillmon: 
“Mary 
Did 
You 

Know?” by Pentatonix. An a 

cappella fan, who would’ve 

thought?

Junior 
guard 
Priscilla 

Smeenge: Mariah Carey’s “All I 

Want for Christmas is You”

Senior 
forward 
Kayla 

Robbins: 
Following 
in 

Smeenge’s footsteps, if only by 

order I wrote this.

Sophomore guard Amy Dilk: 

“Mistletoe” by Justin Bieber. 

Hm.

Johnson: Jingle bells.

Sidor: “Last Christmas” by 

Wham!

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico: Sleigh Ride. She sang it, 

too. Maybe she and Hillmon 

should start an a cappella 

group together.

We also kept track of when 

the right time to listen to 

Christmas music is, but I lost all 

the audio and didn’t transcribe 

any of it. We all make mistakes.

Fantasy vacation spot:

Sophomore guard Danielle 

Rauch: Italy. When further 

pressed, she said, “I don’t know, 

it just seems cool.” Michigan 

has taken its past two team trips 

to Italy, says communications 

director Sarah VanMetre.

Hillmon: 
Egypt. 
Same 

reasoning as Rauch.

Junior forward Hailey Brown 

and Johnson: Bora Bora. The 

pair both fell in love with the 

location after seeing multiple 

Twitter posts about it. They 

obviously have very good feed 

selections.

Conspiracy Theories:

Sophomore forward Emily 

Kiser: A whole lot of them. The 

one I feel comfortable sharing 

is aliens.

Johnson: Snow isn’t real. 

There’s a video out there where 

snow chars after a lighter is put 

to it, she uses as her evidence. 

Johnson comes from Toledo, 

where it snowed on Monday.

Barnes Arico: After serious 

pressing, 
and 
confirmation 

that Kiser is a conspiracy nut, 

she came up with her own after 

Dilk nearly got a triple double: 

She pulled Dilk to prevent her 

from reaching that milestone.

Recipes:

There are too many pasta 

ones, so we’ll go with the crowd 

(my) favorites.

Barnes Arico: Fish tacos. She 

doesn’t cook anymore, she has 

a husband for that.

Hillmon: Orders from Uber 

eats.

Johnson: French toast bread 

with eggs, bacon and a drizzle 

of maple syrup for sauce. A 

word from the wise: Turn off 

the fire alarm when you make 

bacon on the stove, otherwise 

you get angry looks from your 

neighbors.

Varejão: 
Beijinhos. 

Condensed milk, butter and 

coconut. Google calls them 

coconut kisses.

Peanut butter and jelly 

sandwiches:

Barnes 
Arico: 
Creamy 

peanut butter and raspberry 

jelly.

Dilk: Smooth peanut butter 

and nothing.

Johnson: Chunky and grape.

***

There were many more 

questions and many more 

answers, 
but 
due 
to 
our 

youthful ignorance, we forgot 

to transcribe them. So it goes.

As we social distance in the 

new sports-less world, maybe 

take a page out of Johnson’s 

book and make some beijinhos, 

find out if snow is real and 

listen to some Christmas songs 

to remember when times were 

good two decades — I mean 

weeks — ago.

Breaking down three questions facing Michigan’s defense in 2020

In a normal year, this 

would be about the time 

Michigan 
would 
hold 

a 
coordinators’ 
press 

conference. 
Don 
Brown 

would stand in front of 

reporters, be his normal, 

animated self, and speak 

to the issues facing the 

Wolverines’ 
defense 
this 

season.

But 
COVID-19 
has 

changed all that. A press 

conference in the time of 

stay-at-home orders is both 

unwise and illegal. Instead, 

with no live sports left to 

speak of, we’re forced to 

speculate on the answers. 

In light of that, The Daily 

analyzed 
some 
of 
the 

unknowns 
surrounding 

the defense and where the 

solutions could come from:

Who will be the third 

corner?

Last year, Michigan had a 

steady cornerback rotation 

of 
Lavert 
Hill, 
Ambry 

Thomas and Vincent Gray. 

But with Hill graduated and 

on to the NFL, there’s an 

opening.

Thomas 
has 
already 

announced 
his 
return 

and Gray will presumably 

start 
opposite 
him. 
But 

behind those starters, the 

Wolverines’ depth is murky. 

The favorites to see playing 

time seem to be redshirt 

freshman DJ Turner and 

redshirt sophomore Gemon 

Green. Both played a limited 

role last season — Green 

played 
in 
11 
games 
on 

special teams and had one 

garbage time appearance at 

corner, and Turner played in 

four games on special teams 

— but coaches spoke highly 

of both.

Redshirt 
sophomore 

Hunter 
Reynolds, 
who 

appeared in two games at 

corner and eight additional 

games 
playing 
special 

teams last season and had 

a 
tackle-for-loss 
against 

Maryland, could also be an 

option. As could redshirt 

freshman Jalen Perry, who 

did not see game action in 

the fall but was a four-star 

recruit. Sophomore Daxton 

Hill, 
a 
five-star 
recruit 

at safety, can also play 

nickel corner, but moving 

there seems unlikely as 

Michigan also lacks depth 

at Hill’s natural position. 

Instead, expect him to start 

at safety alongside senior 

Brad Hawkins. Both were 

Pro Football Focus All-Big 

Ten selections last year 

and should prove steadying 

forces in the secondary.

Can Cameron McGrone 

build 
on 
a 
breakout 

season?

After losing All-American 

Devin Bush — a first-round 

pick 
of 
the 
Pittsburgh 

Steelers in 2018 — Michigan 

faced plenty of questions 

at the MIKE linebacker 

position. The spot originally 

went to Josh Ross, who did 

a fine job. But when Ross 

went down with an injury, 

McGrone stepped in and 

became a revelation.

In his sophomore season, 

McGrone had nine tackles 

for loss, five quarterback 

hits, 3.5 sacks, a forced 

fumble and a pass breakup 

while showing flashes of the 

sideline-to-sideline 
speed 

that made Bush so great. He 

also made his fair share of 

rookie mistakes. McGrone 

isn’t Bush, but the extent 

to which he can build on 

his All-Big Ten honorable 

mention 
season 
could 

determine how good the 

Wolverines’ defense can be.

With longtime stalwarts 

Jordan 
Glasgow 
and 

Khaleke Hudson graduated, 

McGrone will have to step 

up as the leader of the 

linebacking corps. A vocal 

player last year, he’ll be 

tasked with keeping his unit 

motivated and providing a 

steadying force at a position 

in the center of everything.

Is 
Michael 
Barrett 

ready to step up at VIPER?

The VIPER is a key 

position in Brown’s defenses. 

Jabrill Peppers spent two 

years manning the position, 

then Hudson took over for 

the next three. Together, 

the two have provided the 

kind of positional stability 

most teams would long to 

have. Now, though, Hudson 

has graduated and Michigan 

needs to find a new answer 

at the position.

The 
ideal 
solution 
is 

redshirt sophomore Michael 

Barrett, who has spent the 

last year being groomed 

as Hudson’s replacement. 

A 
former 
high-school 

quarterback, 
Barrett 
has 

already 
shown 
some 
of 

Hudson’s 
special-teams 

prowess, with two fake-

punt conversions in 2019. 

But whether he can match 

what Hudson could do at the 

VIPER position remains to 

be seen.

Barrett seems to have 

all the tools to succeed, but 

he’s seen very few actual 

reps at the position. He 

appeared at VIPER in just 

three games in 2019, mostly 

in garbage time. Spring 

camp was supposed to help 

with that inexperience, but 

all spring football activities 

have been canceled in the 

wake of the pandemic. Now, 

the Wolverines just have to 

hope that the work Barrett 

put in last year pays off and 

he’s ready to fill the big 

shoes Peppers and Hudson 

left behind.

Isaiah Livers and Franz Wagner ponder NBA Draft decisions

In 
the 
face 
of 
an 

unprecented 
NBA 
Draft 

season, 
two 
Michigan 

men’s 
basketball 
players 

are staring down the same 

difficult decision.

As the dominoes begin 

to fall around the world of 

college basketball, junior 

forward 
Isaiah 
Livers 

and freshman wing Franz 

Wagner have yet to decide 

whether they’ll be returning 

to Ann Arbor next fall or 

entering the NBA Draft. For 

each player, there’s a strong 

case to be made for both 

routes.

In Livers’s case, entering 

the 
draft 
provides 
an 

opportunity 
to 
pawn 

his 
stellar 
offensive 

performances 
from 

November 
and 
February 

into an NBA contract. On 

the flip side, missing 10 

games due to three different 

injuries 
and 
shooting 
a 

combined 14-for-47 from the 

field over the Wolverines’ 

last four games might put a 

dent in his stock.

“I trust that Isaiah will 

confide in me as well as his 

parents to help him evaluate 

what the best decision for his 

future is,” Michigan coach 

Juwan Howard said on a 

teleconference 
Thursday. 

“I will do whatever I can to 

give him my honest opinion. 

Right now, we haven’t had a 

true discussion yet.”

Wagner, 

meanwhile, 

could 

become one 

of the more 

intriguing 

prospects if 

he 
declares 

for 
this 

year’s 
NBA 

Draft. 
At 

just 18 years 

old, his long 6-foot-9 frame 

and two-way game could 

be attractive to NBA teams 

looking for help on the wing.

Wagner 

missed 
the 

Wolverines’ 

first 
four 

games 
after 

fracturing his 

right 
wrist 

during a fall 

practice, but 

by the end of 

the 
season, 

he 
was 
the 

team’s best offensive player. 

He averaged 16.6 points on 

62 percent shooting over 

Michigan’s last five games, 

raising 
the 

question 
of 

whether 
he 

may be NBA-

ready in the 

process.

“Franz 

and I have 

had a brief 

conversation 

about testing 

the 
NBA 

waters,” Howard said. “We 

haven’t had an in-depth 

discussion at all yet. His 

name has been mentioned 

as far as a guy 

who 
could 

possibly test 

the 
NBA 

waters. 
I 

know 
he’s 

going 
to 

make the best 

decision 
for 

himself 
and 

his family.”

Between 

Livers 
and 
Wagner, 
it 

shouldn’t come as a shock 

when one or both opt to at 

least test the waters. Recent 

NCAA rule changes permit 

both to return to Michigan 

following the NBA combine 

if there is no financial 

arrangement with an agent, 

provided they terminate the 

relationship with the agent 

after the process.

With the NBA season 

currently 
suspended, 

however, questions about 

the draft process remain 

unanswered. 
Livers 
and 

Wagner would each benefit 

greatly from a chance to 

boost their stock at the 

combine or individual team 

workouts leading up to June, 

but it’s unclear whether that 

will be possible amid the 

COVID-19 
pandemic. 
At 

the very minimum, getting 

feedback is an effective way 

to implement feedback next 

season, putting each player 

in a better position for 2021.

But for now, like the rest 

of the basketball world, 

Livers and Wagner remain 

uncertain.

“They have been proactive 

in making sure that all of 

the 
communication 
and 

information the NBA is 

sending us, they are aware 

of it,” Howard said. “They 

will 
communicate 
with 

their parents and family 

members to make the best 

decision where they feel 

they’re headed for their 

future.”

Junior forward Isaiah Livers has a difficult decision to make over whether or not to enter the NBA Draft after missing 10 games this season.

Right now, we 
haven’t had a 
true discussion 

yet.

They will ... 
make the best 
decision ... for 
their future.

I 

arrived at the University of Michigan in Febru-
ary as a visiting Ph.D. researcher from the Uni-
versity of Southampton in the United Kingdom. 

When I departed for Ann Arbor, the spread of the novel 
coronavirus was not so critical as it is today. There were 
about 32,000 cases worldwide, with only three in Eng-
land and 12 in the United States. Even in my home coun-
try of Italy, now the global epicenter of COVID-19, only 
three cases were reported. To me, the situation did not 
seem particularly worrisome: We were still one month 
behind the World Health Organization’s declaration of a 
pandemic and the virus seemed destined to be contained 
to the Western Pacific region.

Indeed, as I first set foot in this little city, Ann Arbor, 

home of one of the most beautiful universities, my mind 
was elsewhere. I was full of wonder and expectations 
at the possibilities of new experiences and friendships. 
A blanket of snow, not so common in England, covered 
the city, reminding me of the wooded landscapes back 
home in Italy. At the University, there were a lot of nice 
and friendly people all around: at the libraries, the labo-
ratory and Pierpoint Commons. I was also making plans 
with my Italian girlfriend to come to visit me, so that we 
could admire, for the first time, the views of the Great 
Lakes, the architectural city of Chicago and other beauti-
ful attractions nearby.

But then, only a couple of weeks after my arrival, the 

coronavirus outbreak spiked in Italy and Europe — and 
the world began to shutter itself. Suddenly, everyone real-
ized that to save ourselves, we needed to overcome our 
social instinct and desire to stay together — we needed to 
stay apart from each other, from our family, our friends 
and our loved ones. 

At the University, the libraries, classrooms and cafes 

in which I liked to spend most of my time became very 
different places. I couldn’t hear the cheerful, background 
chatter while waiting in line for my coffee. If I went to 
the library, a doomsday feeling ran down my spine as I 
saw empty seats and aisles. In all the buildings, class-
room doors were fixed open, giving a perspective of an 
ominous future. 

It also became clear that my girlfriend would not be 

able to come to visit me any time soon, and I started to 
worry about my family who lives in Milan — located at 
the center of the peninsula’s outbreak. 

Dramatically, our social structure was turned upside 

down in just a few days, establishing a new normal. It 
is clear that we can’t go on with our usual routines any-
more: There are no more colleagues to chat with, no 
more drinks at the cafe, nights out to make new friends 
or weekends to visit our parents. 

Nonetheless, people have found creative ways to adapt 

to this completely new reality. My colleagues and friends 
at Southampton University created group chats in which 

we can support each other: sharing our newly-created 
workout routines, proposing daily writing and creative 
prompts — like rewriting a chapter of our favorite chil-
dren’s book or drawing a cartoon strip of our day — and 
giving suggestions on what music to listen to. Anything 
to keep us thinking positively and productively. 

Indeed, with so much idle time away from work, it is 

now not as cool as before to waste time laying on the sofa 
watching thousands of TV series and scrolling through 
endless Instagram posts. As Jerome Klapka Jerome nice-
ly put it in his book “Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow”: 

“It is impossible to enjoy idling thoroughly unless one 

has plenty of work to do. There is no fun in doing noth-
ing when you have nothing to do. Wasting time is merely 
an occupation then, and a most exhausting one. Idleness, 
like kisses, to be sweet must be stolen.”

It seems that in this quarantine, we have found new 

ways to stay together, support each other and rediscover 
ourselves — maybe even more than we did before the out-
break — when many of us were too concerned with our 
smartphones to engage with each other.

Now, people have rediscovered board games or found 

out about inner creativity that they didn’t even know they 
had, building the strangest instruments to put up against 
the virus outbreak. 

One man in Italy fabricated portable cardboard into 

the form of a spaceship so that when worn, it would keep 
you the required one-meter distance from other people. 
In Rome, people decided to do a flash mob by singing and 
playing guitars from their windows.

Nobody knows how long this outbreak will last and 

how much time it will take to go back to our previous 
routines. If I will not be able to explore Ann Arbor and 
the great land- and city-scapes of this state for at least a 
while, I can and am still having a meaningful experience 
in this city. The extra time at home gave me the oppor-
tunity to reassess my daily life. I have finally found the 
courage to begin those activities I always wanted to do 
but that I kept postponing: daily workouts, yoga, medi-
tation, reading, video calls with my parents and friends. 
This, in turn, has helped me increase my productivity as 
a researcher.

A few months ago, if anybody had suggested shut-

ting myself in my house for a month as a way to improve 
my life routine, I would have never believed them. Yet, 
thanks to the mutual support of all the people around the 
world, it worked.

T

he dark night sky outside 
filled the window of my studio 
apartment, but my nerves awoke 

me with a jolt of panic at 5 a.m. It was 
March 20 in Melbourne, Australia, and 
an anxious pit formed in my stomach 
as I got ready to hop on a flight to travel 
back to the United States. I prepared my 
N95 face masks, tupperware of sanitizing 
wipes, hand sanitizer and latex gloves for 
my journey. I watched my last Melbourne 
sunrise through my window, the usually-
hostile Australian sun diminishing into a 
soft, orange glow like a halo around the 
Melbourne skyline. 

Just a week ago, the Australian sun 

shone through that same window of my 
studio apartment, pleasantly warming 
up my cheeks until I slowly woke up. It 
was 7 a.m. on Friday the 13th, and I felt 
the nerves setting in as I pushed my bed 
sheets off my body. I stretched my torso 
across the gap between my bed and my 
desk, anxiously reaching for my phone 
and clicking on my email app. 

“[UPDATE] -- CGIS Winter 2020 

Programs” read the subject line to a new 
email in my inbox.

The words were ominous and sunk 

heavy in my mind. I took a deep breath 
and clicked the email. As my eyes perused 
the bright screen, they felt sandy from 
exhaustion. Then, in bold letters: “You 
must return to the United States by March 
20, 2020.” I kept looking for the words 
“but” or “exception,” but I couldn’t find 
them anywhere. 

A few days before the news that I had to 

leave entered my inbox or thoughts, I was 
living a slow-paced life in Melbourne. I was 
taking three classes at the University of 
Melbourne about subjects I actually found 
interesting and the coursework was not 
overwhelming. In just a short few weeks, 
I had met enough people that whenever 
I walked through campus I bumped into 
someone I knew. My evenings consisted of 
sitting on benches in grassy park squares, 
basking in the sun to make up for the 
Vitamin D I had lost from being at home 
on the East Coast of the U.S. for too long 
during winter. I could understand Aussie 
slang well, but I was still learning and 
I indulged in at least two cups of coffee 
per day (Melbourne is known for their 
amazing coffee). I was preparing to go to 
surf camp with my friends at Lorne Beach, 
a little, surfer, hippy town on Great Ocean 
Road. 

After receiving the news that I had to 

return home, it felt surreal walking along 
the sunny streets of Melbourne, the cool 
breeze hitting my warm and flushed 
face. It felt like I was sleepwalking. My 
brain couldn’t process that I would have 
to leave Australia in a week’s time. I felt 
an unnamed emotion — fear and anxiety 
mixed with anger — hitting me so abruptly 
that I became dizzy from the impact. 

My anxiety took over as I thought 

about the impact — on myself and others 
— if I were to contract COVID-19. There 
are currently fewer cases in the entire 
country of Australia of COVID-19 than 
there are in New York state. To get home, 
I would have to go through three airports 
and spend a total minimum of 24 hours 
traveling, including 18 hours on a plane. 
In the U.S., I would automatically join the 
shared mindset of panic and worry, not to 
mention I would be living in a home where 
a family member of mine recently suffered 
from a pulmonary embolism, a condition 
that increases risk for those who contract 
COVID-19. 

Even more so, as I read that email 

in Australia, one thought came to the 
forefront of my mind: It’s been a blessing 
being far away from the U.S. I watched 
from halfway across the world as the U.S. 
fumbled with the outbreak of the new 
virus: clumsily mishandling COVID-19 
tests, having lax travel restriction policies 
and a president who ignores the warnings 
of public health officials. I watched as the 
U.S. slowly crumbled under the hands of 
this pandemic.

The mental toll of the news was 

extremely difficult. I felt exhausted at 
every second of the day for a week, my 
eyes perpetually brimmed with tears that 
would spill onto my cheeks as I explained 
to my new Aussie friends why I had to go. 
Every morning that I walked to class, I 
would look around the beautiful city I’d 
come to love, watching the people walk 
by the street and giggling at the thought 
of the funny lingo and unnecessary 
abbreviations they use.

While living in Australia, the pandemic, 

to me, only existed on social media and 
headlines. COVID-19 did not dominate 
everyday conversations yet; it was more 
of an afterthought. The government 
of Australia was preparing for the 

pandemic 
from 
its 
inception, 
with 

travel restrictions and monitoring border 
control. I felt like everything was going 
to be OK and that I had some control over 
the situation. I wasn’t afraid to look at 
numbers or projections, and I knew that 
if I were to experience symptoms, I would 
be able to get a test. Panic-buying toilet 
paper and other goods was still happening 
in Australia — there wasn’t a complete 
detachment of what the world was dealing 
with — but I still felt safer in Melbourne 
than back home in the U.S.

The stark reality in the U.S. and around 

the world was very different. As of March 
25, there are over 50,000 cases of COVID-
19 and 700 deaths related to COVID-19 in 
the U.S. Globally, there have been tens of 
thousands of COVID-19 related deaths, 
with that number climbing. 

Reaching out to the University of 

Michigan for answers and support proved 
moot. The feeling of not having control 
came back again — the familiar feeling 
that I can walk up the door to President 
Schlissel’s home, knock on it, scream my 
anxiety and grievances in his face and still 
not be heard.

“Get out by March 20,” they said. Then, 

a generic list of our “next steps,” including 
booking a ticket and notifying our parents 
and a blurb telling us we should contact 
the institution we were currently studying 
at to determine an academic plan. It was 
business-like, transactional and cold, 
completely neglecting the fact that I 
might need time and space to breathe and 
genuine mental and emotional support 
to guide me through this process. I was 
left to strategize my exit plan with only 
my peers and whatever information our 
parents could gather, which was not much. 

It did not seem to cross the minds of 

those in power at the University that 
traveling halfway across the world during 

a global pandemic might be as mentally 
taxing as it is financially taxing.

The University made me feel as if I was 

more of a liability to them than a student 
they cared about being safe, healthy and 
mentally-well — receiving information 
when it’s too late, giving me the same 
cookie-cutter 
responses 
and, 
most 

importantly, not making me feel like my 
voice or concerns were being heard. 

Even though I landed in New York City 

less than a week ago, there is an incredible 
sense of fear and panic that is constantly 
in the back of my mind. After enduring a 
16 hour flight to Los Angeles International 
Airport, my first stop back in the U.S., I 
faced no screening — no one asked me any 
questions, no one checked if I had a fever or 
a dry cough. I was released into the empty 
airport, except for the people also trying 
to get home. I boarded a desolate flight to 
New York City, the epicenter of COVID-19 
in the U.S. When I landed, I again faced 
no questions or recommendations to self-
isolate for two weeks. 

I 
fear 
the 
possibility 
of 
having 

contracted the virus while traveling, 
that I might spread the virus, that I am 
an asymptomatic carrier and will add 
to the problem and, even worse, that if I 
develop symptoms, I will not be able to 
get the treatment that I need or even a test 
due to limited resources. Though there are 
signs of spring in the trees and bushes, the 
New York City streets and roads are barren 
from human life. Even though I have not 
seen anyone outside my own family since 
I’ve landed, I can still sense the mass panic 
hanging heavy in the frigid air. The once 
bustling streets in the city that never sleeps 
are empty and it’s a terrifying contrast to 
the sun-filled and easy-going atmosphere I 
was in not too long ago. 

Now, I struggle to find out what my 

academic schedule will look like my senior 
year of college given the circumstances and 
new “Pass/No Record-COVID” grading 
system, what the financial impacts of this 
pandemic will be on my education and 
whether or not, when I graduate next year, 
there will be a job waiting for me. The future 
is uncertain and up in the air as the world is 
at a standstill. I can’t help scrolling through 
my camera roll on my phone at least once 
a day to look at pictures of the Melbourne 
skyline pierced with shiny skyscrapers or 
the hilly landscape of the countryside. I 
think of the budding friendships that were 
cut short and the missed adventures at surf 
camp. While I am grateful to be home safe, 
I can’t help but think of what would have 
probably been the best four months of my 
life.

Coming home during a global pandemic


I 

skipped my first BlueJeans lecture to 
buy a pair of shoes.

The sole employee at the Ann 

Arbor Running Company looked surprised 
to see me. He kept pulling the wrong sizes 
and I kept feeling too socially anxious to 
correct him. It had been six days since Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer announced a state of 
emergency, and we were both a bit rusty 
on our interpersonal skills. He untied a 
size-too-small sneaker from a stool rolled 
six feet away and went through all the 
correct small-talk motions: How was my 
running going? Was I a student? What year? 
President Donald Trump was announcing 
new restrictions from the flat screen in the 
back of the store that usually played silent 
reruns of pixelated cross-country races. 

“This is a bad one,” Trump proclaimed 

from the store speakers. “This is a very bad 
one.”

“I’m a senior,” I replied to the salesman 

while tying up a size-too-large shoe, one 
eye on the screen.

“Neat,” the guy replied. “Got anything 

lined up?”

Before the COVID-19 outbreak defined 

our daily lives, my habitual reply to this 
dreaded question had been a good-natured 
“nahhhh,” friendly in its lingering “h,” or 
perhaps a more optimistic “not yet” if the 
questioner appeared genuinely concerned 
about my future or was related to me by 
blood. But in the Ann Arbor Running 
Company, while Trump announced we 
“may be” diving head-first into a recession 
(but will be “raring to go” by Easter), 
I began to feel uncertain in a way that 
resisted friendliness or optimism.

“I, uhh, I really don’t know,” I told him. 

And I realized, for what felt like the first 
time, I seriously believed it.
L

ast week the United States 
Labor Department released data 
indicating that, from March 7 to 

March 14, the rise in initial unemployment 
claims outnumbered that of any week 
during or since 2008. In a recent New York 

Times article analyzing this data, Justin 
Wolfers, professor of economics and public 
policy at the University of Michigan, pointed 
out that this is unlike a “normal” recession, 
which typically takes months of joblessness, 
two consecutive quarters of negative 
GDP and a bureaucratic declaration to be 
universally recognized as an “official” 
recession in every sense of the word. 

“The last recession began in December 

2007, but even half a year later, some 
economists were still debating whether the 
economy had entered a recession,” Wolfers 
wrote. “This time, there’s no debate.” 

But other experts have scrapped that 

vernacular entirely, insisting that the 
dystopian extremities of the COVID-19 
economy cannot be explained with normal 
jargon. We are living in the most intense bear 
market on record: unprecedented declines 
in stock and security due to widespread 
sentiments of fear and pessimism. 

“What is happening is a shock to the 

American economy more sudden and severe 
than anyone alive has ever experienced,” 
stated esteemed policy journalist Annie 
Lowrey in The Atlantic last week. “This is 
not a recession. This is an ice age.”

Right, wrong or indifferent, trauma 

has a history of changing the way we talk 
about things, each disaster with its own 
little vocabulary nebula. McCarthyism, 
Trumpism, Stalinism, the War on Drugs, 
the War on Terror — these phrases didn’t 
exist or matter before cluttering the 
national (or international) conversation 
with paranoid frequency during their 
respective moments. They carry their 
emotional history with them, grim little 
linguistic keepsakes fossilized into the way 
we speak. The alt-right. #MeToo. The dot-
com bubble. Social distancing. Flatten the 
curve. No Record Covid. Economic ice age. 

Another 
term 
has 
squeaked 
into 

being amid this century of change: lost 
generation. Gertrude Stein is credited 
with coining the phrase, which Ernest 
Hemingway then popularized in the 

epigraph of “The Sun Also Rises” in 1926 — 
“you are all a lost generation.” Just peachy. 
Stein and Hemingway were originally 
referring to the generation of people 
coming-of-age during or after World War 
I — the first global conflict to trickle down 
into American daily life in a way that felt 
personal. 

Since 1926, though, the term “lost 

generation” has slowly become unstuck 
from the context of its inception alone. 
The 
long-revered 
Oxford 
English 

Dictionary 
clarifies 
that 
the 
largely 

historic phrase is “also used more generally 
of any generation judged to have ‘lost’ 
its values.” Lexico, a more colloquial 
collaboration between Dictionary.com and 
Oxford University Press, gives the term an 
additional entry below the definition of its 
literal origin. It reads:

“An unfulfilled generation coming to 

maturity during a period of instability.”
M

aggie Li, an LSA senior 
studying 
biomolecular 

science, was breaking up with 

her boyfriend around the time the World 
Health Organization named the outbreak 
“COVID-19.” Li went home to weather the 
breakup with family, returned briefly to 
take her midterms and then flew right back 
home for spring break. She was recharging 
for the second half of the term, hopeful 
to return and end her final semester on 
a high she could ride into the start of her 
independent adult life. 

“And then right when I got back that 

Wednesday, they literally announced that 
all classes are going to be online for the rest 
of the semester. And I was like, ‘Are you 
serious?’ ” Li said in a phone interview with 
The Daily.

“I was just ready to come back and swing 

into things and, like, get my life on track. 
And then now, nothing is normal.”

Instead, Li found herself back home 

in New York for the third time in three 
weeks, grappling with much more than her 
lingering breakup.

“I’m taking a gap year before med school, 

and I’m in touch with a lot of research labs. 
But I don’t know what I’m going to do with 
my life because all of the labs obviously are 
not focusing on hiring right now, which I 
completely understand. But now my life is 
on hold.”

Through the phone, Li paused to take a 

breath. Later in our conversation, she told 
me that she actually had had a lab contract 
lined up with Massachusetts General 
Hospital, but it happened to be in close 
proximity to her then-boyfriend. She turned 
the offer down when they broke up, to open 
her future to positions and opportunities 
elsewhere. And labs elsewhere — including 
Mount Sinai in New York — had been really 
receptive to her application. Things were 
looking good. Empowering, even. But that 
was before, as she put it, “this whole thing 
blew out.”

“Now the MCAT is canceled for quite 

some time … and if they’ve canceled school 
(through spring and summer terms), then 
they’ll probably cancel testing, and then 
when am I going to take it? Like, am I 
going to have to take another year off just 
because of a situation that’s kind of out of 
my control?”

Rachel Rudd, a senior in the School of 

Nursing, expressed similar uncertainty 
about the NCLEX, the nationwide exam for 
graduating nurses.

“We all have to take the NCLEX in order 

to get our RN licensure, and we don’t really 
know what’s going to happen with that, 
because usually, we take them in late May 
or June,” Rudd told The Daily in a recent 
phone interview (note: starting March 
25, the NCSBN, which administers the 
NCLEX, has reduced testing to “a limited 
number of test centers” according to federal 
guidelines). “So, it may be over by then and 
it may not be. So, I think that’s just like a 
wait-and-see sort of thing.”

While some seniors are questioning the 

status of their already-scheduled exams, 
others have been freshly motivated to 

consider 
taking 

them 
in 
the 
first 

place — the binary 
tension 
indicative 

of a populace near-
robotically uncertain 
about which way to 
turn. Public Policy 
senior Elise Rometsch 
expressed 
as 
such 

in a recent phone 
interview with The 
Daily.

“I 
don’t 
have 

anything 
lined 
up 

… and was looking 
for a job, but I also 
had plans of going to 
maybe grad school 
or 
potentially 
law 

school 
down 
the 

road, and I’m like, 
‘Should I hurry those 
up?’ Because I know 

when the economy’s not doing well, that’s 
generally like, ‘Okay, time to go to grad 
school.’ ”
I 

eventually confessed to the man at 
the Ann Arbor Running Company 
that I was a size 8.5, that his 7s and 

9s weren’t going to help me meet the sick 
mileage goals that had become 
increasingly integral to my sense 
of self-worth with every day and 
email since March 11. They had 
none in stock, which I refrained 
from 
reading 
symbolically. 
I 

ended up ordering a pair through 
the store, making some comment 
about how I’d rather give my 
money to them than a third party 
on the internet. “Thanks,” the man 
told me, unimpressed, gingerly 
holding out my receipt.

A week later, I called the Ann 

Arbor Running Company to check 
on my order. It was March 23, and 
when I woke up, Whitmer had 
issued her “Stay Home, Stay Safe” 
Executive Order, toppling a domino 
network of tense conversations 
and packed bags between friends, 
family and loved ones statewide. 

I too was throwing socks and 

books into my duffel, phone 
wedged between shoulder and 
ear, preparing to move to my 
boyfriend’s 
place 
a 
whopping 

block down the street. He and his 
housemates had decided to use 
the Whitmer’s order as grounds to 
self-quarantine their house for two weeks, 
legitimately, to ensure they didn’t have the 
virus before going home-home to more 
immunosuppressed or elderly familiars. 
I was invited, so long as I followed the 
sole Spartan rule: No one goes in or out. 
I was down to confidently delay my own 
seemingly inevitable breakup for two more 
weeks, so I agreed.

In or out. Together or not. Life had really 

gone binary.

Back on the phone, a non-identified male 

running voice spoke: “Sturm … I remember 
your name, let me check the book.” It didn’t 
sound like the guy I had talked to in the 
store from the week before, which relieved 
me. “Hmm. OK yeah, order placed, but not 
in yet. Soon, though. We’ll give you a call.”

“Okay,” I replied, dropping a pair of pink 

silk pants that I would never wear into my 
bag. “But I’m kind of moving to a sensitive 
household, we’re in town but I don’t think 
I can …”

“We’ll bring it to you,” this anonymous 

man said, cutting me off. “Of course.”

“Whoa. Like, to the door?” I asked. Mom-

and-pop running shops don’t operate like 
Grubhub.

“Yes. We’ll bring them to you. Doorstep. 

Don’t worry about it. We’ll give you a call, 
and we’ll bring them.” 
A

t the time of my interview with 
Rometsch, my recent Google 
searches included “GRE,” “GRE 

when,” “how long writing sample English 
Ph.D.” and “LSAT casual.” Safe to say, 
my feet were firmly planted in the same 
tenuous camp as Rometsch re: continued 
education. And, as she pointed out, it was 
economic anxiety that sent me there, not 
my boundless zeal for specialized study. 

I went into this year tabling grad school 
because I didn’t want to waste my time 
diving so expensively into something I 
wasn’t 100 percent certain about. Now, I’m 
just seeking refuge.

Historical data, as usual, tells me 

this plan is unexceptional. In October 
2009, the number of LSAT examinations 
administered reached an all-time high of 
60,746, a 20 percent increase 
from 

the year prior — that is, before the 2008 
financial crisis. Similarly, the number of 
Americans who took the GRE in 2009 rose 
13 percent from the disastrous year prior, 
peaking at 670,000 test-takers. 

What that does to the selectivity of the 

applicant pool, I don’t even want to know. 
But Stanford economist Caroline Hoxby has 
studied the pattern and confirmed that 
interest in higher education has indeed 
increased during every recession since the 
1960s. 

Who can blame us? On Monday, Vox 

published the “scariest unemployment 
chart ever,” depicting a projection from 
Goldman Sachs — 2.25 million new claims 
— that pushes the y-axis to a point where 
an illustration is moot. The labor market 
doesn’t even feel like an option. 

“Most people at our school usually get 

a job coming right out of college. That’s 
just, like, how that works. … But is anyone 
really even going to be hiring people right 
now?” Stephanie Stan said, an LSA senior 
studying biopsychology, cognition and 
neuroscience, in a recent phone interview 
with The Daily. “It’s not only the people 
who have a job lined up (who are impacted) 
or those that won’t make as much money as 
they would have coming right out. It’s now 
people who are still applying, or thinking 

about applying.”

And although Rudd is pretty confident 

that she’ll find employment upon her RN 
licensure, she’s wary about the larger labor 
pattern that will eventually cut into her 
industry as the pandemic naturally ebbs.

“A lot of people are talking about how 

there may be this surge in (health care) 
workers, but then when COVID-19 is over, 
what are we going to do with all the extra 

people? I’m not sure if that’s even going to 
affect me or what’s going to happen,” Rudd 
said.

The rules we’ve been raised on don’t seem 

to apply to the class of 2020. Stan is right, 
the University frequently tells us that most 
people at our school usually get a job 
coming right out of college. But that data 
doesn’t account for an economic ice age. 
Similarly, labor statistics tell us that nurses 
are projected to remain in high demand. 
But job security seems more complicated 
when entering an industry at a time when 
demand is so disproportionately inflated.

“Graduating generally is terrifying,” 

Rometsch told me. “And now, not only are 
we dealing with classes we’ve never had 
anything like (before), we have to deal with 
adapting to new situations. We have to deal 
with trying to find a job in an economy 
where no one knows what’s going on.”
L

ike most self-conscious writers, 
I began to gaslight the validity 
of my own piece about halfway 

through my research. What if this isn’t 
actually happening on an individual basis? 
Data can say most anything if you just zoom 
out enough. Am I misreading the signs? Am 
I going to publish something that stirs more 
panic for less reason?

As if on cue, I got an email from a 

publishing firm that I was prepping 
for a round two interview with, 
declaring “all summer internships 
canceled due to the ongoing health 
crisis.”

I 
dissociated 
momentarily 

before texting my mom “the thing 
I made second round for was 
canceled lol.”

She replied immediately: “That 

sucks. Andrew’s job postponed 
indefinitely, too.”

My brother Andrew graduated 

from a small liberal arts school 
with a degree in aquaculture 
this past May. He’s been living 
at home most of the past year, 
doggedly applying to jobs. He’s on 
the Asperger’s end of the Autism 
spectrum — more than capable of 
doing excellent work, but outside 
neurotypical. And, of course, job 
interviews are implicitly designed 
around 
(and 
evaluative 
of) 

neurotypicality. 

Andrew works three times as 

hard for an “average” degree of 
opportunity, at least according 
to University standards. He and 
I have never enjoyed the same 

amount of agency in this world, especially 
regarding academia and work.

In late February, Andrew finally got a job 

offer. Now?

“Oh shit,” I replied.

I 

tug my sweatshirt 
sleeve 
over 
my 

fingers 
to 
avoid 

direct contact with the 
door handle as I walk into 
the Michigan Union. Sam 
walks up with me, saying 
“Well, let’s go downstairs 
to the bookstore to buy 
our graduation caps and 
gowns.” Only minutes ago, 
we received the University-
wide 
email, 
amid 
the 

COVID-19 
pandemic, 

announcing that classes 
would be transitioned to 
online platforms for the 
rest of the semester.

A few months prior, I 

had been pondering the 
thoughts 
of 
T.S. 
Eliot 

— Do I dare? — as we 
read “The Love Song of 
J. 
Alfred 
Prufrock” 
in 

my poetry course. I felt 
invincible entering my last 
semester at the University 
of Michigan: so liberated, 
so empowered, so restless 
over 
the 
endless 
opportunities 

to be explored post-graduation. Eliot 
ponders, Disturb the universe? I felt as if I 
could possess the world if I dared.

Back in the Union with Sam, the 

employees at the bookstore partake in 
the frenzied dialogues occurring on 
campus: Whether or not their store 
would be open tomorrow, whether or 
not commencement would even happen, 
whether or not students will start to 
leave. “Reece, should I get the block 
‘M’ stole for my gown?” Sam and I 
distracted ourselves with the faint hope 
of a remaining commencement; after all, 
at that point, classes were technically 
canceled in-person only until April 21. 
Earlier in the semester, I told myself that 
graduation would come so quickly, but 
I now found that I was lying to myself 
about the proximity of May 2. Surely, the 
chaos of the pandemic would subside by 
then, right? One day at a time.

A few days later, along with the 

cancellation of March Madness, Broadway 
shows and the closure of Disneyland, I 
walk into my kitchen to place my newly 
purchased package of Clorox wipes on the 
counter, only to find my roommate Nicole 
tearing up. My heart skips a beat as she 
tells me that all commencement activities 
are canceled until further notice: the 
unfathomable actually happening. 

In a minute there is time / For decisions 

and revisions for which a minute will 
reverse. 

The universe had disturbed me. I 

couldn’t understand the meaning behind 
all of this. When I had joked I never want 
to graduate from college, this was not 
what I was referring to. That is not what 
I meant at all; That is not it, at all — Eliot’s 
words echo in my mind.

I tap skip as “Landslide” randomly 

plays from my shuffled Spotify songs, 
and by this point, I had left Nicole and 
retreated to the succulent-filled, coffee 
cup-cluttered desk in my room. No Stevie 
Nicks, I can’t sail through the changing 
ocean tides. My world of the Michigan 
maize and blue had faded to a solemn 
gray. My family overwhelms me with text 
messages: Grandma Fran assures me that 
we will celebrate eventually, my mom 
tells me that a delayed ceremony will be 
all the more rewarding and Aunt Trish 
says we can set up a faux-mencement with 
chairs in the backyard. 

Doesn’t that then make graduation 

some meaningless social construct? What 
I thought had been feelings of sadness, 
devastation, bitterness and anger, were 
actually emotions of anxiety and fears of 
missing out: I can’t get these meaningful 
last two months of my life back, they won’t 
be postponed to a later date. It’s a loss of 
closure, traditions and promises I made to 
myself as a freshman — all of which are 
now broken. Of course, my time at the 
University wasn’t exactly picture-perfect, 
but I thought taking that last photo of my 
friends and I in caps and gowns, blissfully 
spraying bottles of champagne in front 
of the Big House on an April afternoon 

would filter out the insecurities of the 
past.

Others encourage me to “phone it in” 

with my classwork as a second-semester 
senior, and though I quite literally phone 
into Google Hangout, my classes are 
what keep me energized. I thought I was 
hitting my stride as I finally found my 
voice as a writer and a passion for my 
English major. Now was supposed to be 
the pinnacle of my academic experience. 
I wanted to soak up every late night in the 
library, every sentence of that court case 
reading, the rush of turning that essay 
in two minutes before the deadline, the 
moment of nearly making it to class on 
time, the class discussions, the capstone 
assignments.

So how should I presume? Eliot asks. 

Harking back to my freshman year history 
class, I recall the ancient Incan construct 
of time. The Incans understand time as a 
past in front of them and a future behind 
them. In a spatial sense, their backs are 
turned against the future and they are 
faced toward the past. Time, therefore, 
flows forward and into the past. I’m 
left to confront the past in order to find 
clarity in my present, and eventually my 
future. Even Shakespeare reminds me 
that the “past is prologue” — there is an 
unraveling of beginnings as well as an 
unraveling of endings.

My email inbox becomes deluged 

by messages from professors. There’s 
a 
connected 
disconnect 
between 

me, 
my 
professors 
and 
peers 
in 

these 
unprecedented 

times. I expected to be 
overwhelmed 
with 
new 

assignments and deadlines, 
yet 
they’re 
trying 
to 

get 
their 
bearings 
no 

differently than we are. 
It’s inspiring to see how 
they’re not trying to mask 
the 
challenges 
of 
this 

transition. 
My 
political 

science 
professor 
now 

signs every email with 
“this too shall pass”; one 
of my English professors 
inspires us to “lean into” 
the moment and that, from 
a 
writer’s 
perspective, 

it’s almost better when 
things don’t go as planned. 
He 
brings 
up 
novels 

including 
Thucydides’ 

“Peloponnesian War,” “The 
Decameron” and William 
Maxwell’s 
“They 
Came 

Like Swallows” to remind 
us that this confrontation of 
unknown 
circumstances 

isn’t as unprecedented as 
it seems. He also asks us 

to think about how today’s circumstances 
will matter in five days. Five months. Five 
years.

My other English professor passes 

along articles from The New Yorker, in 
which teachers sympathize with the 
sorrows of students during the disrupted 
narrative of our undergraduate careers. 
She stresses to us that staying connected 
is what matters most in these stressful 
times, and remarks that hopefully, the 
readings can provide a good distraction 
for us. Through it all, the literature 
persists. As we discuss the confusion of 
pronouns in Anne Carson’s poetry during 
our Google Hangout class, my mind 
wanders and I rearrange the pronouns 
in my own circumstances. Why does 
the pronoun “my” have to come before 
canceled commencement and not the 
pronoun 
“your”? 
This 
cancellation 

doesn’t coincide with the class of 2021 or 
the class of 2019. I have to take possession 
of the chaos and remember it’s actually 
“ours” to dare. I turn the page of my Eliot 
poem, And indeed, there will be a time. At 
this moment those words feel hollow to 
me, rather — It is impossible to say just 
what I mean!

T

he first time I read about COVID-19 was over 
Winter Break. It was early January, and I was in 
Florida with my family on vacation. Iranian Gen-

eral Qasem Soleimani was just killed, and I was mentally 
preparing for war. My thoughts were running in a million 
different directions. Social media wasn’t helping. Twit-
ter, Instagram, Facebook and even my group chats were 
flooded with topical memes. I couldn’t concentrate or focus 
without theorizing about what was to come and yet, amid 
the possible World War III madness, there came another 
chilling report:

A new, highly contagious virus was identified in China.
Nope. Not today. I shut off my phone, took a deep breath 

and pretended as if I didn’t just read that. 

At the time, that was a sufficient coping mechanism. 

The report was posted on Instagram by a meme account 
that issued out any content for clickbait. If @todayyearsold 
was willing to post baseless news claims 
only to delete them after a few hours, how 
could I trust this report? It seemed almost 
obvious to dismiss it and move on. 

The weeks to follow seemed to calm 

down in their own ways. While tragedies 
were still occurring around the world, 
my everyday life seemed to once again be 
filled with trivial pursuits upon return-
ing to school. There, I settled into what I 
thought was an unbreakable routine. My 
roommate and I would wake up at the 
same time every morning, snoozing nearly 
five alarms before starting the day. I went 
to classes Monday through Friday, with 
club meetings on Monday and Tuesday 
evenings. On a night in, my friends and I 
would attempt to stop working around 11 
p.m. and watch “The Bachelor” or “Sex 
and the City” until we couldn’t keep our 
eyes open. On other occasions, we would 
find ourselves out, house party hopping 
until it was time to debrief over bagels in 
the kitchen. This schedule was a solidified 
pattern, only to be broken by cramming 
for an exam or a trip out of town. 

I was no longer wrapped up in what 

doom was filling the world on a greater 
scale. I no longer had the time to ruminate over the “what-
if” society scenarios, so they quietly left my mind. There 
wasn’t room for me to be consumed by international poli-
tics — I was consumed by the world directly in front of me. 
The second semester of my sophomore year was supposed 
to be the best term yet, and a few weeks into the semes-
ter, I felt that prophecy coming into fruition. The year was 
scheduled to pick up around the first weekend of February 
with my parents flying in to visit. After that, my friends and 
I could name what was on tap for every weekend to come: 
Mom’s Weekend, Winterfest, Spring Break, date parties, 
the Michigan Fashion Media Summit, a Toronto trip, birth-
days, Hash Bash, a possible Windsor outing and then finals. 
Wine Tuesdays, new restaurants, random late night excur-
sions to Target. Nights spent at parties wreaking of stale 
beer and sweat, in bars we could barely get into, in libraries 
more social than academic, in meetings taken as seriously 
as class, in bedrooms plastered with polaroids, in my best 
friend’s car for hours on end. 

Distraction after distraction. Moment after moment.
Talk around our house was therefore focused on the 

exciting times to come, as if they were promised. What time 
do we wake up for Winterfest? How much are you packing 
for Spring Break? Did you get a dress for date party yet? Did 
you find a date? How many exams do you have this week? 
Are you going out tonight?

The next set of COVID-19 related news seemed to change 

the course of conversation only marginally. Some study 
abroad programs were being cut short, and in turn, some 
Spring Break trips to Europe were canceled. Instagram 
pictures from Florence abroad turned to Snapchat stories 
of plane rides back homes, but the virus had yet to hit the 
United States. While people sympathized with those affect-
ed, life continued as normal. After all, the Spring Break trip 
I planned with my friends was still on, and we had yet to 
establish who was packing what. 

After the aforementioned vacation, I went home for part 

of Spring Break. At my first dinner back, the reality of the 

world crept back into my vision, invited to the table by my 
mother. She had warned me that the Michigan Fashion 
Media Summit, an organization I was a part of, was going 
to have to cancel its yearly summit. Typically, the event con-
sisted of 15 or more fashion industry professionals, offering 
students a chance to learn and network with top names in 
retail. The summit took a year to plan, with a team of over 
50 students dedicated to our efforts. I wouldn’t let myself 
believe her, calling her crazy and paranoid while tear-
ing up at dinner. I refused to listen — we worked too hard 
for a virus to stop us. Yet the Monday I returned back, the 
MFMS’ Presidents announced that news exactly. Fourteen 
out of 19 speakers had pulled out, as they were put on trav-
el quarantines. We could not put on an in-person summit 
without them. 

Everything after that night seemed to pick up very quick-

ly. 

On the Tuesday night that followed, I was nursing a 

glass of wine, sprawled across my friend Andrew’s couch. 
Him, my friend Natalie and I were indulging in a Michigan 
Democratic primary watch party, channeling our energy 

into political mania. While we were half watching the votes 
come in and half making TikToks, we were interrupted by 
inevitable news: 

Michigan declared a state of emergency. There were two 

cases in the state. The University canceled any event that 
was scheduled to have over 100 people in attendance.

By that Wednesday, it seemed like every university around 

the country was going online. Since we were at a large pub-
lic university, we guessed it was unlikely the dorms would 
close due to the amount of students that relied on them for 
food and shelter. As sophomores in off-campus housing, 
we were not yet forced out of our house nor were we wor-
ried that we would be. The others around us weren’t either. 
Because of this, we gave into our optimism and assumed the 
rest of the semester would continue as semi-usual. 

We were hopeful and naive, never having experienced a 

pandemic in our lifetimes. In our minds, it almost seemed 

like a utopia: Everyone would stay at 
school, taking online classes with minimal 
schoolwork, spending endless amounts 
of time with friends, going out whenever 
seemed fit, twiddling our thumbs to fig-
ure out what new adventure we should 
take on the day with. Looking back now, it 
seems irresponsible that we even thought 
this way, but we were tucked away in our 
personal bubbles of college and youth. 

Of course, this unrealistic mindset 

changed almost instantaneously. More 
drastic news was being released on an 
hourly basis. On Friday morning, classes 
were moved to online platforms, all com-
mencement ceremonies were canceled 
and all students were strongly encour-
aged to go home as soon as possible. On 
Monday, dorms were closing for all but 
those who relied on them. On Monday 
night, we learned that we had to be out of 
our house by Thursday afternoon. Within 
a matter of days, it became evident that 
our previous plans did not mirror reality. 

Mixed emotions were everywhere. 

People were crying during meals, while 
on the phone with their families or in the 

middle of a gathering. Conversations were 

dominated by how much we would miss life in Ann Arbor, 
reminiscing on all of the times we’ve had thus far. Snapchat 
stories were all centered around the last endeavors of the 
year. Some would break down at the mention of when oth-
ers planned to leave, seniors especially and reasonably so 
— they were promised a sense of closure, a final semester 
filled with bittersweet last hoorahs. Everything they had 
imagined was now blurred and distorted. 

Everyone felt a little cheated. I myself did. I didn’t want 

to go home. I had work to do for classes, pieces to write for 
the MFMS, interviews to prepare for. I had my friends that I 
wanted to do nothing and everything with. I had met people 
this semester that I expected even just a few months more 
of time with. All of that was melting away. 

Yet as much as this stung, and as much as it still does, I 

know I am one of the lucky ones.
