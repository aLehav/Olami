Current policy,
bans 'U'-sponsored
travel to countries,
under warnings
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily Staff Reporter
University officials are con-
sidering changes to a policy
that bans the University from
sponsoring study abroad pro-
grams in countries deemed
dangerous by the federal gov-
ernment.
The University's current
policy does not allow it to spon-
sor study abroad programs in
countries under U.S. Depart-,
ment of State travel warnings.
And while students interested
in traveling to these areas may
do so by participating in pro-
grams offered by other insti-
tutions and transferring the
credits, University administra-
tors have started reconsidering
the University's policy.
According to the State
Department's website, 35 coun-
tries currently have travel
warnings, which are issued
when a country is considered

"unstable or dangerous" for an
extended period of time. These
countries include Egypt, Haiti,
Iran, the Philippines, Mexico
and Israel.
Mark Tessler, the Universi-
ty's vice provost of internation-
al affairs, gave a presentation
on internationalization at the
University at a Feb. 17 Univer-
sity Board of Regents meeting.
Tessler said his office works to
realize the University's goal of
expanding the number of stu-
dents who study abroad.
"In the last few years, the
number of students going
abroad has doubled," he said at
the meeting. "And we're proud
of that, but we think there is
more to be done."
Following his presentation
at the Regents meeting, the
Board began a discussion about
reconsidering the University's
policy, in which regents asked
University Provost Phil Han-
lon to see that the existing
policy was re-evaluated. The
re-evaluation was also partially
spurred by a petition in support
for a program abroad in Israel.
The petition was organized
by WolvPAC, a student group
focused on improving campus

is that obviously someone could
be hit in the eye, and they could

In addition, an incident of this

she said.

Daily Staff Reporter
While many students go out
during the weekends to mingle
with fellow singles, college

social life is a different experi-
ence all together for those who
have already found their signifi-
cant others.
Though there are no official
statistics on the number of mar-
ried University students, sev-
eral community officials said
they believe the demographic is
relatively small on campus. Part
of this group, several married

the Michigan Daily that while
they are happy with their choice
of wedlock, they feel there is a

Museums are often known
for being quiet places of obser-

With songs by, the Univer-

UMMA hosted an open house
last night to increase aware-
ness about its exhibits and pro-

more than 400 guests - pri-

by UMMA's Student Program-

Gay history must be part of
education, Calif. bill states

Iraqi army attacks Iranian
camp after days of tension

Democratic bill
passes on 23-14
party line vote
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)
- Gays, lesbians, bisexuals and
transgender people would be
added to the lengthy list of social
and ethnic groups that public
schools must include in social
studies lessons under a landmark
bill passed yesterday by the Cali-
fornia Senate.
If the bill is adopted bythe state

Assembly and signed by Gov. Jerry
Brown, California would become
the first state to require the teach-
ing of gay history.
Supporters say the move is
needed to counter anti-gay stereo-
types and beliefs that make chil-
dren in those groups vulnerable to
bullying and suicide.
Opponents counter that such
instruction would further burden
an already crowded curriculum
and expose students to a subject
that some parents find objection-
able.
The legislation, sponsored by

Democratic Sen. Mark Leno of
San Francisco, passed on a 23-14
party line vote. It also would add
disabled people to the curriculum.
The bill gives school districts
flexibility in deciding what to
include in the lessons and at what
grades students would receive
them.
But starting in the 2013-14
school year, it would prohibit dis-
tricts and the California Board of
Educationfromusingtextbooks or
other instructional materials that
reflect adversely on gay, bisexual
and transgender Americans.

April 8 raid targeted the Ashraf residents, who feared
they were about to be attacked
after nervously watching sol-
diers bulk up their forces out-
side the camp. The Iraqi general
who led the raid said it was in
response to Ashraf residents
pelting his troops with rocks and
throwing themselves in front of
military cars.
U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Chairman John Kerry yesterday
called ita "massacre."
The U.N. visit was critical
because the Ashraf residents
and the Iraqi government have
issued wildly different accounts
of the raid and the reasons
behind it.
U.N. human rights spokes-
man Rupert Colville in Geneva
said a team of U.N. observers
saw 28 bodies still at the camp

compound in eastern Diyala
province. Most of the bod-
ies appeared to have been shot
St and some were women, he said.
Three of the bodies appeared
to have been crushed to death,
a Western diplomat in Baghdad
said - likely from being run over
by a car.
"It's clearly a very serious
incident and we are trying to
get more information," Colville
said. He said six bodies are
"elsewhere" but did not clarify
where.
The Ashraf residents main-
tained from the start that 34
people were killed and as many
as 325 wounded. The Iraqi gov-
ernment said three people were.

killed.
Both Iran and the U.S. con-
sider the People's Mujahedeen
Organization of Iran to be a
terrorist threat, although the
European Union removed the
group from its terror list several
years ago.
After Saddam fell, U.S. troops
took control of Camp Ashraf, dis-
armed its fighters and confined
the resident to their 30-square-
mile camp. In return, the mili-
tary signed an agreement with
the camp's 3,400 residents giving
them protected status under the
Geneva Conventions.
But it's not clear whether the
residents still have those legal
protections.
Iraqi allies in Washington
and London and U.N. officers in
Geneva sharply criticized last
week's raid, but Iran praised it.
Kerry called the raid "deeply
disturbing" and "simply unac-
ceptable." He called on the Iraqi
government to conduct a full and
serious investigation and said the
U.S., U.N. and European Union
must help broker a peaceful solu-
tion between the two sides.
"Corrective action is impera-
tive," Kerry said in a statement.
"The (Iraqi) investigation must
hold accountable the respon-
sible parties and ensure that
there will be no sequel to these
horrific events."
The U.N. inspection of the
camp came five days after
the human rights agency first
demanded to be allowed in.
The Iraqi army and police have
blocked access to the camp for
more than a year, following a
similar raid in July 2009.
A U.S. Army medical team
also entered the camp last week-
end to provide humanitarian
aid but has refused comment on
what it looked like inside. Jour-
nalists have not been allowed
in. Until the U.N. visit, the only
official casualty count in the
raid came from the morgue at
Baqouba public hospital, where
officials said they received 12
bodies from the camp.

An international dispute over
a surge of Tunisian immigrants
* escalated yesterday when the
French foreign minister told Italy
to send the migrants home instead
of allowing them to travel to
neighboring nations.
Some 26,000 illegal migrants
have taken boats across the Medi-
terranean to the small Italian
island of Lampedisa in recent
weeks in what Italian officials
have labeled a "human tsunami."
Italy has said the immigration
is a Europe-wide problem and it
will give the migrants six-month
residence permits that would
allow the migrants to travel to
other countries in Europe's visa-

France says it will only honor
permits held by migrants who can
prove they have sufficient finan-

versity of Michigan, is the
perfect fit for ... radical, out-of-
the-box thinking in terms of the
Greek experience.'
This year's ceremony also
commemorated the achieve-
ments of Chris Haughee, the
assistant director of the Uni-
versity's Office of Greek Life.
Haughee has worked with the
University Greek community
for six years and will be step-
ping down from the position
in June. Mary Beth Seiler, the
director of Greek Life at the
University, said Haughee was a
great contributor to the Greek
community and will be greatly
missed.
"I have been privileged to
work with someone who has
demonstrated qualities for
which we should all strive - a
strong work ethic and integ-
rity," Seiler said. "Living the
bounds of Greek life and being
accountable for one's actions
are messages that we have all
heard from Chris on a regular

basis."
The Greek Woman oftheYear
award was given to LSA senior
Katie Rosenberg, a member of
the Kappa Kappa Gamma soror-
ity. Rosenberg served as presi-
dent of the University's chapter
of her sorority and was presi-
dent of the Panhellenic Asso-
ciation at the University last
year. Rosenberg was lauded for
philanthropy and public good
efforts. Among Rosenberg's
accomplishments is her work to
improve Greek chapter academ-
ics, campus safety and off-cam-
pus lighting.
In an interview after the cer-
emony, Rosenberg, who will be
teaching in New Jersey next
year for Teach For America, said
she is excited and honored to
win the award.
"It's been the culmination of
a longtime at the University and
a lot of time with Greek life,"
Rosenberg said.
LSA senior Matt Francis, a
member of Delta Tau Delta fra-
ternity, was honored as Greek
Man of the Year. He was recog-
nized for his humility, responsi-
bility, work ethic and leadership.

In an interview after the
event, Francis said his award
was "completely unexpected"
and that there are a number
of other fraternity members
deserving of the award.
The ceremony also celebrated
the work of Scott Ellsworth, a
lecturer in the Afroamerican
and African studies Depart-
ment at the University, by giving
him the Professor Award for his
positive influence on the Greek
community.
Other honors included
awards for alumni, campus
involvement, new members,
recruitment, programming and
scholastic achievement.
In an interview before the
ceremony, Seiler said she is
excited about what the Greek
community has accomplished
this year.
"There have been a lot of suc-
cesses, but there are challenges
every year as well," she said.
"This night is one of the most
fun events because these are the
individuals I know, the chapters
I know, and I'm so proud of what
they've done. It's so great to see
them be recognized."

MARRIED
From Page 1
students.
"(Being married) does set you
apart, like being a commuter
student," McMacken said. "It
doesn't mean you can't be social
and integrate, it just sets you
apart a little."
Though being married meant
foregoing the excitement and
uncertainty of dating in college,
McMacken said the lifestyle has
proven a positive choice for him.
"It's something that is just
very stable and comforting in my
life," he said. "The fact that I can
do bad on an exam and have a
really rough day, but I've got this
foundation that I can always fall
back on."
LSA senior Sharan Shokar,
who is planning her wedding
in June, said she believes it is
uncommon for undergraduate
students to get married while in
school.
"I don't think it's the norm
anymore to get married so
young," she said. "But my goals
were always to go to college, get
my degree and see what happens
after that."
LSA junior Nicole Brancheau,
who is engaged to be married in
August, said one of the difficul-
ties of being engaged or married
as an undergraduate female is the
assumption by fellow students or
professors that being married
means she will notbe continuing
her education or career.
"Some of them assumed that I
was getting my degree and going
to be a housewife somewhere or
just have kids right away," Bran-
cheau said. "(That) presumption
... is something that is somewhat
rude, and it's frustrating when
you're trying to be taken seri-
ously as a student."
Brancheau also said she is frus-
trated by the general assumption
that married undergraduates
aren't as serious in their relation-
ships as older couples.
"There's a lot of assumptions
in society right now that young
marriages don't have a chance
and that, especially in the under-
graduate population, that these
are sort of impetuous marriages,

that they're not as well thought
through," Brancheau said. "I
don't believe that that is the
case."
Shokar said though she
believes there will always be
negative stereotypes associated
withyoungmarriages,these pre-
sumptions didn't affect her deci-
sion to get married.
"You get married because
you've found the right person
and when it feels right," Shokar
said. "And for me that is now."
Despite these students' expe-
riences, religious leaders at
campus congregations and a
University official said they have
seen a low number of married
students in recent years.
University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan wrote in an
e-mail interview that while Uni-
versity Housing doesn't keep
data on the number of married
students living in campus resi-
dence halls, he has noticed a
decline in recent years.
"Anecdotally, we are seeing
fewer married students take
contracts for Northwood Com-
munity Apartments over the
years, but we have not studied
the trend to know why," Logan
wrote.
Reverend Reid Hamilton,
chaplain of the Episcopal Cam-
pus Ministry Canterbury House,
said he has never presided over
any marriage ceremonies for
undergraduate students in his
seven years at the Canterbury
House.
"I haven't had any undergrad-
uate students who are members

contemplating getting married,"
Hamilton said. "Everybody sort
of graduates first - some get
married pretty freshly out of col-
lege."
Similarly, Michael Brooks,
executive director of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Hillel, said
he thinks it is uncommon for
students to get married as under-
graduates or prior to coming to
college here.
According to 2009 U.S. Cen-
sus data, 87 percent of males ages
20 to24 had never been married,
compared with 77.4 percent of
females ages 20 to 24 who had
never been married.

MEDMA members deejayed the
background tunes.
LSA junior Michael Sullivan,
a member of UMMA's Student
Programming and Advisory
Board, said the plethora of styles
and forms of art in the museum
are captivating and inspiring for
student artists and non-artists
alike.
"We saw the most extensive
collection of Whistler prints on
exhibit this year," Sullivan said,
referringto one of the museum's
exhibits. "The Art Museum was
designed with all of the disci-
plines in mind."
The values of the museum
align with the University's great-

er goals to be innovative and pro-
gressive, Sullivan said.
"Museums typically have
what is known as an-authorial
voice," Sullivan said. "Museums
are able to say, 'This is what I
want it to be and what I want it
to mean for me."'
,Lisa Borgsdorf, manager of
public programs and campus
engagement for the museum,
said UMMA's goal is to illumi-
nate artwork for a broad range of
people who might not otherwise
typically experience it.
"Art should not be limited to
a certain group," Borgsdorf said.
"We want to encourage all stu-
dents to see the museum and all
that it has to offer."
LSA sophomore Lindsay Lori-
don, who works in the museum's
art store and gift shop, said

UMMA visitors have a diverse
range of cultural backgrounds
and levels of experience with
art. She added that the museum
is expecting an especially large
crowd the weekend of Spring
Commencement, scheduled for
April 30, as parents and others
will be visiting Ann Arbor.
LSA freshman Anders Hela-
koski said he came to the event
because, as an electronic music
fan, he was excited that mem-
bers of MEDMA were deejaying.
He added that the organization's
music helped to enhance his
experience of viewing the art-
work.
"After tonight, I now com-
pletely agree with having
MEDMA here," Helakoski said.
"It definitely adds a new layer to
the experience."

troops in July
BERLIN (AP) - U.S. Secre-
tary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton warned NATO allies
yesterday against bringing forc-
es home from Afghanistan too
soon, even as the United States
prepares to begin drawing down
its forces in July.
Clinton said the Taliban will
be watching what the alliance
does in the coming months and
that speedy reductions will
hurt the fragile security gains
the alliance claims. The United
States is worried that pressure
will grow within the alliance
to match U.S. withdrawals and
answer rising discontent with
the war in Europe.
Clinton told NATO for-
eign ministers that an exodus
of other forces would make it
appear to the Taliban that with-
drawals were a sign of alliance
weakness and defeat. The U.S.
and its NATO partners cast the
planned reductions as a mark of
success and the beginning of a
transition to Afghan control that
would allow all foreign forces to
a

"We need to ensure that these
sacrifices are not overtaken by
political expediency and short-
term thinking," Clinton said.
"We need to worry less about
how fast we can leave and more
about how we can help the
Afghan people build onthe gains
of the past 15 months. Even as
we move toward Afghan lead
in areas where conditions war-
rant transition, we must retain
forces where our commanders
need them and reinvest person-
nel with ISAF's guidance. To do
this once, we have to do it right."
President Barack Obama,
who approved more than
40,000 additional forces for
Afghanistan in the first year of
his presidency, has pledged to
begin withdrawing U.S. troops
in July. The initial withdrawal
is expected to be modest, but
it is politically significant as a
mark of U.S. intention to begin
shouldering less of the load in
Afghanistan and bring all com-
bat forces out by the end of 2014.
As the plans for that with-
drawal move ahead, Clinton
stressed that the alliance had
"to underscore that we are tran-
sitioning, not leaving."

combined.
She said the Taliban and other
extremistgroups would seize on
any opportunity to claim vic-
tory. And she said NATO should
brace for a brutal spring fight-
ing season in which the Taliban
"will seek to reassert themselves
and regain lost ground-includ-
ing in the areas transitioning to
Afghan protection."
"We have to steel ourselves
and our publics for the possibil-
ity that the Taliban will resort
to the most destructive and sen-
sational attacks we have seen,"
Clinton said. "We have to send
a clear message that we remain
united, and we have to offer the
Taliban a clear choice."
She reaffirmed support for
Afghan President Hamid Kar-
zai's desire to lure Taliban fight-
ers back into society as long as
they meet certain condition. But
she said it was equally impor-
tant to make clear that those
who reject such overtures will
paythe price.
"Those who choose violence
must face relentless pressure,"
she said. "The Taliban need to
know that they cannot wait us
out."

Blowing in the wind
Learn from DTE's alternative energy efforts
As the debate over the state budget continues, one question
remains at the forefront: How can Michigan rebuild its
economy for the 21st century? According to DTE Energy,,
the answer may be blowing in the wind. On Wednesday, the utili-
ties giant, which provides more than three million Michigan homes
and businesses with energy, unveiled plans to build its first wind
farms in the state. By providing cleaner energy and developing the
promising renewable energy business sector, this $225 million proj-
ect is a solid investment for both DTE and the state of Michigan.

Collective amnesia

S

According to an April 13 article from The
Associated Press, DTE plans to build about 50
wind turbines in Huron and Sanilac counties,
producing 110 megawatts of energy that can
power over 100,000 homes. This is an encour-
aging turnaround for the corporation, which
was sued in August by the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency for spending tens of millions
of dollars repairing coal-fired power plants.
By building these energy farms in Michigan's
Thumb region, DTE is not only saving face, but
doing its part to help meet Michigan's renew-
able energy goal - a 45-percent reduction of
fossil fuel use by 2020. The development of
these turbines is a great way to make clean,
sustainable energy available to Michigan citi-
zens on a large scale.
The development of the turbines will not
only serve as a source of clean power for
Michigan, but will also aid in the growth of
businesses focussed on renewable energy in
the state. The Big Three's financial roller-
coaster ride, over the past decade, made it
clear that in order to get out of this state of
economic stagnation, Michigan must begin
industrial development in more modern and

promising sectors. From the construction
teams to analysts, the production of wind
turbines in Michigan will create jobs in the
renewable energy industry, helping the state
move forward economically.
Other corporations in Michigan should
take note of DTE's turbine initiative and
work toward developingsimilar environmen-
tally friendly practices. While the creation
of the wind farms will certainly be an aid in
reaching both the state and nation's renew-
able energy goals, DTE can't do it alone.
Other sectors, like the automobile industry,
need to make an effort to create renewable
energy operations. Clean, sustainable energy
is key - not only for the state's and nation's
economic future, but also for the future of
the planet. Michigan companies need follow
DTE's lead, and make a conscious effort to
become more sustainable.
DTE's investment in wind turbines across
the state was a smart move, both economically
and environmentally. Other Michigan busi-
nesses should mirror DTE's efforts and end
'business-as-usual' environmental practices,
in exchange for innovative, green technologies.

don't care about college foot-
ball, but plenty of my friends
do. Every Michigan fan I know
is excited about the Brady Hoke
Era. This new
era will not have
any impact on
my life, but I am
pulling for him.
I still root for
the school, and
more impor-
tantly - speak- /
ing as someone NEILL
who received MOHAMMAD
a degree from
the University
of Illinois - for the Big Ten. Any-
thing that might restore midwestern
glory at the expense of the rest of the
country is a cause I can get behind.
But as someone who studies polit-
ical behavior for a living, the total
about-face among the Michigan fans
overthe pastfewyearsis fascinating.
Lloyd Carr was hustled out of his job
by disgruntled alumni because he
was unfairly perceived to be insuf-
ficiently modern. Just a few years
later, Carr's high-tech, bleeding
edge successor, Rich Rodriguez, has
also been replaced, but by someone
who seems to out-Carr Carr him-
self. Hoke's persona and philosophy,
as they are described in the media,
areso old-fashioned and home-spun
that they come off as caricature.
Rodriguez, the slicked-back opera-
tor, managed to convince Michigan
to pitch in for his multi-million dol-
lar penalty from breaking a contract
at West Virginia University early. By
contrast, Hoke famously signed his
contract with the University with-
out reading it, or even bothering to
ask what he'd be making. I still find
that hard to believe, though I com-
pletely believe that the idea that it
could be true is important to many

fellow fans. t
As is so often the case with nos-
talgia, the facts themselves get in
the way. Carr's farewell tour in 2007
wasn't greeted with the salivation
that Rodriguez's dismissal was,
but most people thought it was for
the best. The conventional wisdom
was unambiguous: Michigan foot-
ball needed to be dragged, kicking
and screaming, into the modern
era. Enter Rodriguez, whose spread
offense put an unheralded West Vir-
giniateamin two BCS bowls in three
years. Of course, the formula didn't
work at Michigan. But now, under
Hoke, the fans have decided after
the fact that not only was a Rodri-
guez himself a poor hire, but the
entire idea of bringing in a modern-
izing figure was a mistake to begin
with. In 2007, Michigan football was
too hidebound and traditional to
compete, but after the 2010 season,
Michigan football was too modern.
What ails us now isn't a failure of
tradition, but instead a failure to be
traditional enough.
This same pattern plays itself
out, over and over again, in sports
and in the wider world. Consider
the budget wars taking place in
Lansing, in Washington, and seem-
ingly everywhere in between. In
the fall of 2008, Barack Obama was
a mortal lock to win the presiden-
cy after eight years of Republican
rule. This was largely because of
those eight years, seven were spent
assaulting the middle class and the
eighth saw the largest single eco-
nomic crisis since 1929. Though
this synopsis probably reads like
ancient history, it was only two and
a half years ago.
Over the past few weeks, col-
lective amnesia has set in with a
vengeance. Everything we took to
be true in 2010 - that tax cuts for

the wealthy don't produce growth,
that gutting economic regulations
damages the economy and leaves
the middle classes holding the bag,
that we can't keep paying more for
healthcarethan any other developed
economy in the world and getting
such poor care for our money - has
been cast out.Even modest changes,
like a healthcare bill that makes it
slightly more difficult for private
insurers to cancel coverage if you get
cancer, have been painted as some
sort of Communist plot against free
enterprise. Warren Buffet already
pays less in taxes, as a percentage of
his income, than his secretary does.
But in 2011, Paul Ryan can peddle
the same regressive tax cuts his
party has proposed for the last 30
years and come off like a courageous
reformer for doing it.
Facts seem to
get in the way
of nostalgia.
Change is hard. New ideas don't
always work as quickly or as neatly
as we'd like. Brady Hoke has been
given the opportunity of a lifetime
because Michigan fans have for-
gotten every word they ever said
or thought about football three
years ago in order to scapegoat Rich
Rodriguez. These are unfortunate
circumstances to be sure, but I hope
Hokedoes well because he seems
like a good guy. I wish I could say
the same for the people benefiting
from our political amnesia.

Relative morality

Conservatives often counter the propos-
als to legalize gay marriage with the "slip-
pery slope" argument. I was listening to a
Glenn Beck broadcast in which he warned
that defining marriage between two consent-
ing adults would open the door to incest and
other deviant persuasions. Some may claim
that these are different situations and that
Republicans are scaremongering, but I would
say that Glenn Beck has exactly the right
idea. I hope that with the legalization of gay
marriage, our other marriage taboos - spe-
cifically our laws against incestuous marriage
- will slide down the proverbial slope into
humanity's closed-minded history.
If you think gays shouldn't get married,
you're probably not going to be convinced
by this article. But if you tend to favor an
expansion of our current marital parameters,
I think some reflection is in order. The laws
barring interracial marriage weren't over-
turned until 1967, when 15 states still had
laws against such a union. God did put differ-
ent ethnicities on different continents, so do
we really want to violate his grand plan? It's
important that we step out of our contempo-
rary societal (and religiops) constraints and
reflect on our culture and history. Our goal
should be to create a contemporary world that
will not have a progeny that is embarrassed of
its forebears.
The logical step when we federally give
gays the rights to marry must also extend
the parameters to incestuous marriages.
The argument that it is gross certainly has
no bearing. Many people are bothered by
homosexual relationships and consider them
unnatural or depraved. Everyone is entitled
to their opinion, but that should not give
these opinions any legal credibility. Our sen-
sibilities changed for interracial marriage,
our sensibilities are changing for gay mar-
riage and our sensibilities should, and most
likely will, change for incestuous marriages.
The best argument levied against incestu-
ous marriages is its effect on children. The
chance of genetic defects among the offspring
of incestuous couples is increased because of
an increased prevalence of recessive genes.
If this is going to be the main argument,
wouldn't it logically follow that we should
ban couples that are known carriers for reces-
sive genetic disorders? Ashkenazi Jews had
a higher prevalence of Tay-Sachs than the
general population. They underwent genetic
screening to avoid having children who had

Tay-Sachs, but if a couple both tested posi-
tive, shouldn't they be barred from having
children?
Legalizing marriage in no way means
legalizing procreation, and incestuous cou-
ples could easily have children even if their
cohabitation isn't legally recognized. As a
form of compromise to those concerned with
the children of incestuous marriages, the U.S.
could arrive at a law that legalized incestu-
ous marriage, but still barred incestuous
procreation. The marriage law could require
medical proof of a vasectomy or a tubal liga-
tion. Incestuous couples simply cohabit with
the marriage benefits that the U.S. extends
to childless couples. What argument could
people levy against people taking precaution-
ary and socially responsible steps to ensure
the prevention of children with birth defects,
who want to receive marriage rights with the
one they love? And if children truly are the
main concern, then the legalization of same-
sex incest and same-sex incestuous marriag-
es circumvents any concerns for offspring
because they obviously won't be having any
children.
Incest with minors is and should remain
a crime, but its legality between consen-
sual adults needs to be modified. Consen-
sual incest between adults is legal in Rhode
Island and New Jersey and is completely
legal between consenting parties in France.
In 25 U.S. states, marriage is legal between
first cousins, while some have counseling
mandates for cousins who want to get mar-
ried. For example, Illinois allows cousins
who are unable to reproduce or are 50 years
or older to get married. These laws need to be
expanded to all 50 states and need to apply
to sibling and other more immediate family
relationships. Cousins who want to get mar-
ried are forced to travel to other states where
it is allowed, much like homosexual couples
of today.
This may be a little hard to swallow, but
whatever progressive logic we apply to homo-
sexual matrimony needs to apply to other
marginalized groups within the country. It
may be complicated, but that doesn't mean we
should wholeheartedly ban incestuous rela-
tionships., Our easily offended sensibilities
shouldn't create victims out of those whose
love manifests itself in a form different than
our own.p

The wrong choice for Senior Day

0

Each year, the University Law School has its own
graduation ceremony on Senior Day, which takes place
the week following the University-wide commence-
ment. Senior Day is a much more intimate and personal
event than the University's ceremony - understand-
able because the graduating law school class is much
smaller, and therefore everyone knows pretty much
everyone else.
The Law School announced the selection of this
year's Senior Day speaker on Monday: It will be Sen.
Rob Portman (R-Ohio), an alumnus of the law school.
Before being elected a senator, Portman served in the
House of Representatives and in a couple different
positions in the George W. Bush administration.
The students who are aware of Portman's selec-
tion are largely disappointed - highlighting his dubi-
ous positions on civil rights issues most salient to the
new generation of lawyers being minted on Senior
Day. For example, the website On The Issues notes
that Portman opposes affirmative action, voted to ban
adoptions by gay people, opposes gays serving in the
military and has even gone so far as to support a consti-
tutional amendment barring gay marriage - a position
considered somewhat extreme even within the Repub-
lican Party.
Some will say it's sad that the mere fact that Portman
is a Republican makes him a controversial and unpopu-
lar selection. Last year's Senior Day speaker was Val-
erie Jarrett, advisor to President Barack Obama. And
while she was also a politicized selection, the majority
of students found her perfectly palatable. But Portman
is not coming to the law school to speak on gay rights.
So should it matter what his political positions are?
Is the fact that he is a successful alumnus of our Law
School and a person who can certainly impart some
words of wisdom on us lawyers-to-be enough to over-
look the rest?
Actually, the problem is deeper than that, and tied
mostly to Portman's views on civil rights for gay peo-
ple. Our graduating class is among the first of a genera-
tion that views equality based on sexual orientation as
something more than an academic question on which
people can agree to disagree. Rather, we have been
raised in a slightly more enlightened world, and count
amongst our friends and colleagues many gay people
who continue to face discrimination that is abhorrent

to the spirit of constitutional protections afforded to
all people.
There was a time when such discrimination was
common, and acceptable. That time has passed: Equal
rights in terms of sexual orientation have become the
most salient social issue for our generation. While
plenty of diversity of opinion remains in our class and
generation, the vast majority of us who find Portman's
views on civil rights tobe outright despicable cannot be
expected to applaud him as an intellectually and pro-
fessionally viable selection.
Senior Day is different from most platforms a pub-
lic university and law school may provide. While
I'd generally commend the presentation of speakers
with diverse opinions, Senior Day is not the time or
place to present a man whose position on perhaps the
most important social issue of our time is so person-
ally offensive and egregious to the vast majority of the
graduating class.
We lawstudents are adults, and the vast majority of
us are responsible, open-minded adults. We should and
do know how to disagree about important things with-
out being belligerent. Even if we strongly disagree with
his political stances, we should be able to listen to Port-
man, politely clap and move on. We should be able to do
this, but we should not have to - not on our Senior Day.
Senior Day is not supposed to be about politics. I
have always been a strong believer that there is a time
and place for political debate and disagreement, but
by presenting Portman as speaker, the Law School has
made Senior Day the appropriate time and place. I'd
rather it wasn't this way. But it is equally crucial that
we Law School students, who owe so much intellectual
growth to our years at this amazing law school, exer-
cise the rights and ideals that we have spent our lives
learning about.
Failing to speak our objection in light of the Law
School's decision to give a platform to a man who advo-
cates positions that are outright discriminatory toward
many of our friends and colleagues is simply unbecom-
ing: We who follow as proud Michigan Law alumni in
the spirit and footsteps of giants of social justice like
Clarence Darrow, Frank Murphy and Branch Rickey
cannot make such a glaring omission.

weekend, the Power Center
Department of From $10
Musical The-
atre will draw its audiences back
to this idyllic age of theatrical
history with Lerner and Loewe's
"Brigadoon," a love story that
transcends time for its charac-
ters and its viewers.
"Brigadoon" tells the tale of a
legendary town of the same name
nestled in the hills of Scotland.
Thanks to a heaven-sent miracle
meant to shieldthe villagers from
the evils of the outside world,
Brigadoon only appears for a sin-
gle day every 100 years.
When two wayward Ameri-
can travelers stumble upon this
anachronistic village, they are
warmly welcomed by the curi-
ous townsfolk. But when one of
the travelers falls head-over-
heels for the village sweetheart,
he finds himself faced with the
ultimate choice: Stay with the
people of Brigadoon and leave
behind his old life, or let the
miraculous town, along with
his true love, fade away into the
mist for another century.
"Brigadoon" opened in 1947, at
the height of the "golden age" of
musicals. Though the popularity
of the show in subsequent years
was eclipsed somewhat by the
1960s film adaptations of other
Lerner and Loewe musicals, like
"Camelot" and "My Fair Lady,"

atre & Dance. "We haven't done
one of the golden era shows in
awhile, and these represent an
incredibly important period of
music to study."
"Brigadoon" is often noted
for its complicated vocal work
and intricate dance routines, in
addition to the acting it requires.
The rigorous nature of the musi-
cal demands not only a full cast
of triple-threat performers,
but also a strenuous rehearsal
schedule that splits and later
recombines the show's different-
performance elements.
"We start by working on dance
teams, on musical staging, on
songs," Goodrich said. "Then once
all of the pieces are developed, we
come back together and start to
combine them into one work,"

Though "Brigadoon" is not
one of Lerner and Loewe's most
well-known shows, Goodrich
said quality and diversity, and
not simply commercial famil
iarity, are the keys to a produc-
tion that's truly meaningful for
its student performers and the
public.
"We're not necessarily look-
ing for a blockbuster," Goodrich
said. "We're looking for some
thing that's good for our stu-
dents to do. And it's also our job
to bring all different kinds of
theater to the public. You have to
educate your audience on all dif-
ferent aspects of theater."
Goodrich found that watch-
ing her performers connect with
"Brigadoon" has been her favor:
ite part of developing the musi-
cal itself.
" '"4'e really enjoyed see-
ing these young people fall in
love with it," Goodrich said.
"Even though it's an old musis
cal, it becomes fresh because it's
young people experiencing it for
the first time and then bringing
their own life to it."

TV REVIEW
* New AMC series The Killing' is murderously good

By PROMA KHOSLA
Daily TV/New Media Editor
"The Killing" is not an easy
show to watch. It's unpleasant,
uncomfortable and downright
painful - but
it is undeniably
riveting. AMC's*
newest drama TheKilling
explores the
mysterious cir- Pilot
cumstances S
surrounding Sundaysat0p.m.
the murder
of 17-year-old
Rosie Larsen and does so with the
narrative expertise that now char-
acterizes this network.
The show unfolds in three dis-
tinct but inextricably linked plot-
lines: first, the police investigation
by Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos,
"Big Love") and Stephen Holder
(Swedish newcomer Joel Kin-
naman). Linden is perpetually
vexed and doesn't show much
emotion, even for her fiancee and
son. It's hard not to be reminded
of Anna Torv on "Fringe," if only
to immediately realize that Tory
commands a presence and Enos
does not. Add in Holder, a former
undercover from County whose
voice is so deep that it strains the
human ear, and we have a clas-
sically unconventional crime-
fighting duo. They hardly have
the chemistry of Bones and
Booth - in fact, they have no
chemistry at all.
Larsen's body is found in a car
belonging to the campaign of
morally gray city mayoral candi-
date Darren Richmond, played
to appropriate ambiguity by Bill
Campbell ("The 4400"). When
he acts suspiciously, it fuels the
murder mystery, but when he
acts ethically, viewers suspect
ulterior motives.
It's no surprise that the

homicide investigation is the
most compelling part of the first
two episodes, so it's hard to care
about the characters' baggage.
Still, it works well in small doses,
which is exactly how it's deliv-
ered. Just when there's too much
political blah-blah, we're back
with Linden and Holder finding
a bloodstained wig in a dump-
ster. Similarly, when those two
get annoying, Richmond returns
with more corrupt secrets to fan
the flames of disbelief.
The third storyline is that of
Rosie Larsen's parents, Mitch
(Michelle Forbes, "True Blood")
and Stanley Larsen (Brent Sexton,
"Flightplan"), and to be honest,
the pilot belongs to them. Noth-

STUDY ABROAD
From Page 1
relations between the United
States and Israel, and was signed
by 1,019 students as of 7 p.m. last
night.
Since February, Tessler has
been working with a small task
force to consider changes to the
policy. In an interview late last
month, Hanlon said the task force
has already gathered information
about the study abroad practices

at other Universities. University
officials' evaluation of the study
abroad policy is scheduled to be
completed in the next month or
two, at which time a report will
be released, Hanlon said.
"We're looking at what other
places do to see if we want to
reconsider our process and our
policy here," Hanlon said.
Sometimes the travel warnings
aren't a good enough reason to
ban studying abroad in an entire
country since only parts of the
country may be dangerous while

other areas maybe safe enough to
host students, Hanlon said.
"The State Department adviso-
ry is kind of a blunt instrument,"
he said. "Either the country is
on the advisory or it's not on the
advisory."
LSA sophomore Caroline Can-
ning, author of the WolvPAC
petition, said the group created
the petition to show support for
a program in Israel despite the
travel warning to the country.
Canning said about 40 students
study abroad in Israel each win-

ter semester through programs
not affiliated with the University.
"We think this should be a pri-
ority because the University hasa
global reach and should have this
partnership," she said.
The group expected some
negative feedback, Canning said,
because of the controversy sur-
rounding Israel, but so far the
petition has garnered support
from people on and beyond cam-
pus.
"We really have only received
positive reactions," she said.

"We've gotten c-mails from
alumni stating their support for
this program and also from stu-
dents who are really happy that
this might be a possibility for
them."
Canning added that without
a University program, some stu-
dents she's spoken to can't pursue
a semester in Israel for various
reasons.
Though Hanlon said a top
priority of the University is to
increase the opportunities for
students to study abroad, he

acknowledged the risk factor for
the University sponsoring pro-
grams in countries experiencing
turmoil. Hanlon cited students
studying abroad in Egypt who
recently had to be evacuated
from their program when condi-
tions became dangerous, adding
that changing the policy would
involve factoring in hazards like
that.
"There's a risk management
piece to this, which doesn't mean
we won't do it," Hanlon said. "We
think there's a lot of value to it."


DPS
From Page 1
times. None of the students were
hit by the pellets, the report stat-
ed. The suspect is thought to be
a 21- to 24-year-old white male
with dirty blond hair down to his
shoulders, medium in build and
having a "scruffy face," according
to the report.
Each incident took place
between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m.,
according to the report. Two sim-
ilar incidents occurred on Janu-
ary 29 within 10 minutes of each
other - one at South State Street
and South University Avenue, the
other at South Forest Avenue near

Willard Street. The victim of the
first incident reported that a BB
gun was being fired, while the lat-
ter victims described the objects
as "small projectiles" - in both
cases coming from silver mini-
vans, according to the report.
Brown said it is still unknown
whether it was the same van
involved in both incidents.
The next incident occurred on
February 27 at South State Street
near the Michigan Union as two
people crossed the street to board
an Ann Arbor Transit Authority
bus, Brown said. The individu-
als reported within the hour that
they were struck by BB gun pel-
lets coming from a blue, four-
door car driving by, but gave no

further description of the vehicle,
according to the report. It is still
unknown whether this incident
was related to the January inci-
dents, Brown said.
As of March 16, DPS has been
offering a $500 reward for infor-
mation about the incidents.
Despite the reward, Brown said
there have not been any leads
provided to the department on
the matter.
Brownwroteinane-mailinter-
view that the drive-by incidents
make it difficult to locate sus-
pects since they occur so quickly.
Additionally, she explained that
DPS faces challenges identifying
perpetrators when victims wait
an extended period of time before

notifying authorities. The victim
ofthe April 10 incident didn't con-
tact DPS until 19 hours after the
drive-by occurred, according to
the DPS report.
"This kind of incident is
so unexpected ... that people
aren't retaining lots of details
that could be helpful to police,"
Brown wrote. "Also, the vic-
tims in two of the incidents
delayed telling the police, mak-
ing it almost impossible to find
a matching vehicle still in the
neighborhood."
In addition to acting as an
incentive for people to report
information to DPS, the reward
is intended to stress the danger of
the weapons on campus, Brown

wrote.
"Weapons, even those consid-
ered by some to be toys, simply do
not have a positive contribution
on a college campus and truly add
to increased safety risks," Brown
wrote.
Brown added that DPS has
seen an increase in reports of pos-
sible gun possessions on campus.
Many of the incidents involved
students using Airsoft guns for
target practice or using Nerf guns
in group initiations and similar
activities, she wrote. While those
using the guns know they aren't
real and aren't intended for harm,
the people around them often do
not, which incites fear, Brown
wrote.

"Given the growing history of
gun violence on college campus-"
es, everyone needs to use more
caution and common sense so
as not to unintentionally cause
fear, concern or worse yet, harm
to others" Brown wrote. "Find
another way to have fun."
Last week, a man holding a
small handgun was reported
to have been in the Chemistry
Building atrium close to mid-
night on Sunday, April 3. The
employee who reported the man
to DPS told University police
that the man was pointing the
gun at her but was gone after the
employee returned to the same
spot a few minutes later after
walking away.

A few people chuckled.
"No, honestly," Hoke replied.
Michigan defensive coor-
dinator Greg Mattison will be
coaching the defense from the
sideline, which is where he will
coach his unit during the season,
too. And offensive coordinator
Al Borges will coach from up in
the press box.
The spring game will mark
the end of Michigan's allotted 15
spring practices, and the coaches
will have to send their players off
into the summer heat to improve
on their own.
For example, there are things
Denard Robinson and Devin
Gardner will have to work on
specifically as quarterbacks.
"I think the footwork issues
that you have in the play-action
game and the ball mechanics,"
Hoke said. "I know guys have the
tendency to rush it. I know talk-
ing to Denard the other day, he
has to settle his feet a little bit in
the dropback stuff.
"And then the mental aspect
of getting you in the right place
of what you're seeing ... I think
all of that is part of the filmwork
that is during the summer and
the physical part of it in the sev-
en-on-sevens and those things."
At the end of their time this
spring, the coaches will sit down
with every player individually.
The players will meet with their
position coaches, their coordina-
tors and then finally Hoke. Hoke
wants to make sure that every-
thing is crystal clear.

Michigan coach Brady Hoke will get one last look at his team during its final practice of the spring tomorrow.

"(We'll) set expectations,
where they're at, what they need
to do," Hoke said. "Where their
weight needs to be when they
report. All kinds of things. What
their role right now is in the fall.
Some of them will be happy and
some of them won't."
With instructions in hand for
each person and each position
group, then it's all up to them.
"This is where you really find
out about your seniors," Hoke
said. "How much leadership
they have.... There will be seven-

on-sevens that the quarterbacks
will organize. That's just part of
what they need to do.
"The evaluations at the end,
believe me, they'll be very specif-
ic in where they're at right now
and where the expectation is for
them to get to."
SPRING GAME NOTES: The
game is free of charge and open
to the public. Michigan Stadium
will be open starting at 9 a.m. on
Saturday morning. However, the
game will also be broadcasted on
the BigTenNetwork.

Heisman-trophy winner Des-

Breaston, Braylon Edwards,
Mike Hart, Zoltan Mesko and
LaMarr Woodley are expected
to be in attendance.
Though attendance is free,
donation's to C.S. Mott Chil-
dren's and Women's Hospital

with free giveaways for e
donation of more than five dol-
lars.

SPRING FOOTBALL GAME PREVIEW
Daily Sports Editor Tim Rohan breaks down the top
five storylines to watch for in tomorrow's scrimmage

0

Fifth-year senior Ryan Van Bergen will be relied upon as a defen-
sive leader in Greg Mattison's newly installed 4-3 scheme.
The Defensive Line
They may not be the four Horsemen of Notre
Dame lore, but Mike Martin, Craig Roh, Ryan Van
Bergen and Will Campbell will surely be fun to
watch under Hoke and Greg Mattison's tutelage.
For one, they're back playing in a defense (the 4-3)
that emphasizes and thrives on the play of its defen-
sive line. As a former defensive line coach, Hoke has
put more pressure on his defensive line to be the strong point
of his defense. He wants to win in the trenches.
And for the Michigan defense to make a turnaround, it has to
start up front.
They're a deep group, too. Jibreel Black is slated to be a danger-
ous pass-rusher and Quinton Washington and Will Heininger
are big bodies who can fill in at times.
Imagine trying to run through Martin and Campbell or
standing in the pocket waiting for Roh to come off the edge like
Terrell Suggs - just watch on Saturday.

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Sophomore running back Stephen Hopkins runs with the ball in a
spring practice. He will be competing for starting nod.

Hopkins and the battle at running back
The same five running backs from a year ago are still in the mix. Some
things haven't changed.
But the offense has, and with a new emphasis on the position, it will be
extremely important to find a No. t and No. 2 back for Hoke before the fall
rolls around:
Think back to the days when Mike Hart and Chris Perry carried the ball
26-plus times a game, and Lloyd Carr was able to hitch his wagon to his
runningback and run to victory - that's what Michigan's running game
will look like once again.
Hoke has said that Stephen Hopkins has been the most consis-
tent running back this spring, but Vincent Smith has also drawn
praise from Borges.
Hopkins isa big back who hits the hole hard, according to
Hoke, which is why Hopkins has played some fullback this
spring.
See if you can call which one of Hopkins, Smith, Mike
Shaw, Mike Cox or Fitz Toussaint will be the next Mike
Hart.

MAX COLLINS/Daily
Redshirt sophomore Seth Broekhuizen will be one of four kick-
ers competing for the starting job in the fall.
The Kicking Game

a

If you have four kickers, do you really have one?
Brendan Gibbons, Seth Broekhuizen, Kris Pauloski and Jer-
emy Ross are competing for the spot and it will be interesting
to see if there has been improvement since last season.
Rich Rodriguez basically gave up on the kicking game and
had one hand tied behind his back when it came to play calling
in the opponents' territory.
Make no mistake about it, a good kicking game may go unno-
ticed, but a poor kickinggame trulyhurts.
The poor weather expected to come on Saturday won't help, but
it won'tnbe hard to top Gibbons' and Broekhuizen's 4-for-14 perfor-
mance last season.

Spring Game's surprise player
Denard Robinson burst onto the scene during last year's spring
game and it spilled over into a productive summer where he
developed into a new-look passer.
And Roy Roundtree has had two successful spring games in a
row. But which potential unknown will step up in the 2011 version
of the game?
1. Cam Gordon: Gordon has had more hype than any other defen-
sive player over the past year and he has moved onto another posi-
tion - this time it's linebacker. And Mattison, in particular, has
been drooling over Gordon's potential since the beginning of the
spring. Gordon's an athletic player, but only time will tell if his
latest position change will pan out.
2. Carvin Johnson: Johnson has been one of the safeties who
has stuck out this spring. Earlier this week, Hoke said that
Johnson has been one of the defensive players who has been
vocal at the back end of the defense, helping get other play-
ers aligned. He started out his true freshman season as
a starter and he could be the starting safety, next
to Jordan Kovacs, this fall.
3. Will Campbell: He barely saw the field
last year, then decided on his own to switch
to the offensive side of the ball. Now, he's
decided to come back, and the big defensive
tackle probably made the right decision. He's
working hard and developing into a player who can be counted on
to contribute.
