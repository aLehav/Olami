ACADEMICS

Michigan Medicine at the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
is 

currently launching Victors 
Care, 
a 
concierge 
medical 

care model aiming to deliver 
tailored health care access to 
a limited number of patients. 
These patients will receive 
specialized, 
convenient 

and 
optimized 
care 
for 

with purchase of an annual 
membership 
fee 
to 
cover 

primary care services without 
copays or deductibles. 

Though concierge medicine 

has been practiced at a number 
of health facilities nationwide 
— 
including 
Michigan 

Medicine 
competitors 
like 

Stanford 
Health 
Care, 

Virginia Mason and the UNC 
Physicians Network Carolina 
Continuity of Care Program 
— the University will institute 
the care approach for the first 
time in April.

Mary Masson, institutional 

positioning 
director 
at 

Michigan 
Medicine, 
said 

Victors Care is one example of 
ways Michigan Medicine aims 
to improve medical care.

“Victors Care is a pilot 

program, 
developed 
after 

requests from patients for a 
service similar to what exists 
at 
institutions 
across 
the 

country,” Masson wrote in a 
statement to The Daily. “This 
is just one of a number of 
ways we’re seeking to improve 
access to and efficiency of care 
we provide. Others include use 
of e-visits when appropriate, 
opening a new facility in 
west 
Ann 
Arbor 
and 
the 

planned opening of another, 
in Brighton this fall, which 
will significantly expand our 
capacity and access.” 

However, 
this 
concierge 

medicine program — often 
referred to as boutique or 
retainer medicine — has drawn 
criticism 
from 
University 

physicians.

Some professors resurface University’s own conflicts with C.C. Little on panel

On Wednesday evening, the 

University of Michigan History 
Department 
held 
a 
teach-in 

surrounding “Disrupting White 
Supremacy: 
Global 
Histories 

and Local Struggles.” The talk 
included 12 speakers in an 
effort to reclaim and retell the 
history of race in the U.S. and 
globally. The speeches were 
followed by a student “talk back” 
panel, focusing on the historical 

injustices and their inaccurate 
recordings that have shaped our 
current political climate. 

Views could follow the talk on 

twitter and pose questions to the 
speakers using the #UMDisrupt.

Teach-ins have a long and 

storied history at the University. 
The nation’s first “teach-in” took 
place on campus in March of 1965 
with 3,000 students gathering 
across rooms in Angell Hall to 
discuss and protest the war in 
Vietnam. 

Rackham 
student 
Tara 

Weinberg explained the urgency 

to come to events like this, 
especially with the controversy 
surrounding white supremacist 
Richard Spencer’s potential visit 
to campus next semester.

“I think it’s really important 

to counter him because if there 
is no counter, then it’s almost 
taken as a given that he’s been 
received with silence and with 
complicity,” Weinberg said.

Several 
professors 
and 

one 
graduate 
student 
spoke 

on how the current political 
climate has been shaped from 
an 
international, 
historical 

perspective. Katherine French, 
a J. Frederick Hoffman professor 
of 
history, 
accompanied 
by 

Rackham 
student 
Taylor 

Sims 
identified 
medieval 

fantastical 
symbols 
used 
by 

white 
supremacists 
in 
the 

Charlottesville protests, and how 
their modern use incorrectly 
represents the Crusades at large. 
This misrepresentation has given 
white supremacists an empty 
sense of security and support, 
and 
has 
misconstrued 
their 

presence to the public. 

ETHAN LEVIN
Daily Staff Reporter

On the corner of two major 

streets just outside downtown 
Ann 
Arbor, 
Police 
Officer 

Christopher 
Hoffman 
parks 

behind a tree that conceals his 
squad car to passersby, about 10 
feet away from the intersection. 
He focuses intently on the cars 
passing through, never once 
taking his gaze off the road. It’s 
a Saturday night and this is his 
usual haunt when it’s “slow” 
during his 12-hour shift. 

He’s looking for cars that go 

through one of the four stop 
signs that mark each road at 
the intersection. Several cars 
commit 
a 
“roll-stop,” 
only 

braking slightly before passing 
through, but he decides not to 
stop any of them.

“I’m looking for the ones 

that speed through, without 
stopping at all,” he said.

Ten minutes pass, and a car 

speeds through the stop sign. 
Gas to the pedal, Hoffman 
turns on his sirens and chases 
after the car. The car pulls over 
in a vacant lot, and after asking 
the driver a few questions, 
reviewing the video footage 
from the camera on the front 
of his police car and checking 
the driver’s record — clean for 
the past seven years —Hoffman 
decides to let her off with a 
warning.

“She’s visiting her sister 

and isn’t under the influence, 
plus she has a squeaky-clean 

record,” he said. “And I’m 
feeling generous since it’s my 
first day back (after two weeks 
of unpaid paternity leave).”

The Daily was allowed to 

participate in a ride-along, 
a program in which police 
departments 
invite 
citizens 

to shadow a police officer 
for a shift, or part of a shift. 
Participants must sign a waiver 
and are assigned to ride with 
an officer based on a rotational 
schedule. The program allows 

citizens 
to 
“see 
firsthand 

the daily workings of law 
enforcement and gain a better 
understanding of the challenges 
and rewards of being a police 
officer.”

“A lot of people look at police 

work as kind of a secretive-type 
thing and it’s not, we’re just 
average people. We’re trying 
out there to do a good job,” 
Hoffman said. “And I think the 
ride-along program lets people 
see that, lets people see why we 

do what we do, our motivations. 
So, I think it’s good to bridge a 
community gap that there is.”

One University of Michigan 

Law School elective, Policing 
and Public Safety, taught by 
U.S. 
District 
Judge 
Judith 

Levy and former U.S. Attorney 
Saul Green, requires students 
to engage with the police 
during the semester either by 
completing a ride-along with 
an area police department or 

LSA Student Government met 

Wednesday night in Mason Hall 
to discuss ballot questions for its 
upcoming elections. The body also 
passed a resolution with a vote of 
15-10, with two abstentions, to 
add a binding ballot question to 
the Winter 2018 election ballot 
on whether government should 
support the Universitye’s decision 
to end Michigan time.

Michigan time is a practice 

used across the University of 
Michigan campus of starting 
classes ten minutes later than 
their 
scheduled 
times. 
This 

was intended to allow students 
enough travel time between back-
to-back classes. However, not 
all of the University’s colleges, 
such as the School of Nursing, 
use Michigan time. On Feb. 19, 
the University and the Provost’s 
Office announced Michigan time 
will end on May 1 in order to make 
collaboration among the different 
colleges 
easier 
and 
instead, 

classes will end 10 minutes early. 
Common student critique was a 
lack of transparency in making 
the decision.

Baxter 
International, 
a 

Fortune 500 American health 
care company, recently signed 
a 
licensing 
agreement 
with 

the University of Michigan to 
acquire rights for a new surgical 
device that was developed by a 
small five-person classroom of 
Engineering 
490/Design 
and 

Manufacturing 450 students.

In 
a 
statement, 
Michael 

Campbell, 
vice 
president 
of 

Baxter’s microsurgery business, 
said Baxter International is 
looking forward to utilizing the 
new device.

“We are excited to work with 

the experts at the University 
of Michigan and license this 
promising 
new 
technology 

that could lead to a meaningful 
impact for microsurgeons,” he 
said.

This 
surgical 
device, 

mirroring that of a small silicone 
pen with an easily adjustable 
steel spine, would make the 
complicated and tedious process 
of connecting arteries more 
efficient by reducing a 25-minute 
procedure to only six minutes.

Professor advocates for diversity of 
thought in classroom & group work

Page shows studies on benefits of variant perspectives in kickoff for Munger case competition

If you could have anyone 
as an imaginary friend, 
who would you choose?

“I would probably 
say Jim Harbaugh. 
I feel like he 
would be a great 
motivator, would 
probably actually 
get me to do my 
work instead of 
just sitting here not 
doing my work. I 
think that would be 
great motivation.”

LSA junior Marco Lewis

After being pushed by a 

colleague to spread his findings 
on diversity, Scott Page, a Leonid 
Hurwicz Collegiate professor 
of complex systems, political 
science and economics at the 
University of Michigan, now 
travels the country discussing 
why diverse perspectives and 
ideas are so crucial to group 
work.

Wednesday afternoon, Page 

discussed diversity of thought 
in a talk concentrated on the 
findings in his most recent novel, 

“The Diversity Bonus.” About 50 
individuals attended the event 
focused on the benefits diversity 
brings to groups solving complex 
problems.

The 
talk 
was 
hosted 
in 

concordance with the founding 
of a new Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion certificate offered by 
the Rackham Graduate School 
and the start of the Winter 
2018 Munger case competition, 
challenging graduate students to 
solve complex problems within 
diverse groups.

Lindsay 
Trahan, 
a 

transdisciplinary 
program 

manager at Munger Graduate 
Residences, 
explained 
the 

Munger case competition and its 
importance in honing graduate 
students’ group skills.

“Every 
semester, 
Munger 

hosts a case competition. So, 
over the past couple of semesters, 
we’ve reached out to strategic 
partners interested in some 
larger topic or issue that is best 
addressed 
through 
diversity 

of thought, getting graduate 
students from across different 
disciplines and having them 
come together to form teams to 
address certain issues, such as 
poverty,” Trahan said. “We want 
to offer students the opportunity 
as they are working through this 
action plan to address diversity 

and inclusion. We want them 
to think about it through 
different lenses.”

Page began his talk by 

explaining the idea behind 
a 
“diversity 
bonus” 
–– 

diversity having a functional, 
pragmatic value in group 
settings, leading to an added 
bonus to efficiency.

Page 
discussed 
how 

the 
term 
“diversity” 
is 

often 
misunderstood 
and 

fundamentally 
based 

on 
experience. 
When 

referencing 
diversity, 

he 
spoke 
on 
different 

perspectives 
and 
ideas 

permeating society.

“When 
dealing 
with 

complexity, you need lots 
of different frameworks to 
make sense of the world,” 
Page said. “What we really 
mean when we say diversity 
is people who think about 
the world in different ways. 
The core takeaway is that 
cognitive diversity improves 
outcomes on complex tasks.”

Page went on to discuss 

the 
logic 
and 
evidence 

behind this finding. Citing 

multiple 
studies 
in 
fields 

ranging from political science 
to biology to economics, Page 
emphasized the concept that 
working in combination, rather 
than isolation, produced higher 
rates 
of 
efficiency, 
accuracy 

and productivity in groups. He 
stressed how group creativity 
outweighed individual creativity 
in almost all situations.

Page refuted the commonly 

held notion that diverse groups of 
individuals counterbalances one 
another to be merely average. In 
fact, he claimed, there is almost 
always a bonus to efficiency 
because of diversity.

“People sort of think there is 

this trade-off between excellence 
and diversity,” Page said. “By 
being inclusive and diverse, we 
will actually achieve excellence.”

Finally, 
Page 
discussed 

identity diversity. He explained 
how 
identity 
fundamentally 

lies in the different attributes 
making up an individual and 
how these identities change 
over time. He then stressed the 
crucial relationship identity and 
diversity share.

Rackham 
student 
David 

Morphew 
discussed 
why 

learning about the importance 
of diversity is crucial to graduate 
students.

“I was very interested in 

the topic because I wanted to 
see some data to back up why 
diversity is so important for 
solving problems on a grander 
scale” Morphew said.

Page closed by reinforcing the 

correlation between success and 
diversity.

“If you want something really 

interesting you have to bring in 
people trained differently, from 
different places, from different 
groups, if you really want to have 
something amazing,” Page said.

For the Daily

by attending a police-community 
meeting. 

The requirement was designed 

to expose future lawyers to the 
daily implementation of the law 
and help them understand what it 
is like to be a police officer.

Law School student Samantha 

Jackson, whose father is the 
deputy sheriff of St. Clair County, 
took the elective because of 
her familial connection to law 
enforcement. Even though she’s 
been exposed to police work from 
a young age, during her ride-
along with the Wayne State Police 
Department, she said she learned 
just how much each department 
can vary.

“In my town, my dad has so 

much pride in his career and is 
really passionate about helping 
people, and that’s the kind of 
perception I grew up with,” 
Jackson said. “And it wasn’t until 
I stepped out of that town that I 

saw the corruption that many 
police departments suffer from, 
the unfair treatment, how it’s just 
so incredibly different — every 
single police department can 
really vary a lot.”

Professor of Law Eve Primus, 

who teaches Criminal Procedure, 
a popular elective at the Law 
School, encourages her students 
to participate in ride-alongs , but 
does not require them to take 
part. 

“When courts interpret laws 

or interpret the constitution, 
and when the legislature makes 
laws, they do it in light of what 
they think are concerns that 
police officers face, so I think 
it’s important for students to 
have exposure and to meet with 
police officers to form their own 
judgments, whether they think 
those concerns are accurate, or 
valid, or things the law should 
or shouldn’t take into account,” 
Primus said.

Law 
School 
student 
Thea 

Marriott 
said 
aside 
from 

providing legal perspective, ride-

alongs allow people to amend 
misconceptions 
about 
police 

officers. 

“I think it’s a really beneficial 

thing to do,” Marriott said. “I 
think a lot of people have sort of 
an imaginary idea in their head of 
what the police actually do, and a 
lot of it is more social-community 
work than policing robbers or 
something like that.”

Law School student Asma 

Husain believes understanding 
how the police work is an 
important part of being a 
lawyer, because police officers 
are the facet of law enforcement 
that people interact with most 
often. 

“Criminal law and policing is 

the vast majority of the average 
person’s interaction with the 
legal system, and most people 
don’t interact with lawyers, they 
interact with the police,” Husain 
said. “I think it’s a responsibility 
of people who deal with the law 
to see (the legal system) from 
the perspective that people are 
most often going to, and being 

aware of not just what police are 
doing for communities but the 
amount of power they have over 
communities and how they’re 
using the law.”

In the Policing and Public 

Safety elective, about half of the 
students chose to participate in a 
ride-along. Jackson said that most 
of them had positive experiences, 
and it increased their respect for 
the work police do.

“Some 
of 
my 
classmates 

expressed that they had a more 
negative perspective of the police, 
but after the ride-along, they 
still saw problems, and it didn’t 
completely change anything, but 
they had a little more respect and 
understanding for the work that 
police try to do, as imperfect as it 
can be,” Jackson said.

One 
problem 
discussed 

frequently in the elective was 
the copious amount of discretion 
police have.

“Police 
have 
so 
much 

discretion,” Jackson said. “You 
know, we have these laws, tons 
of laws, but they’re not perfectly 

enforced 
and 
unfortunately 

they’re often not evenly enforced. 
That’s the cynical view, and 
there’s a lot of truth to that. We 
literally don’t have the resources, 
no 
community, 
no 
police 

department, has the resources 
to fully enforce every single law, 
to catch every person speeding 
on the highway. So they have to 
make choices, and it’s interesting 
to see what forms those choices 
and to be aware of it and to speak 
up if you disagree.”

In recent years, this amount 

of discretion has come under 
fire, with activists suggesting 
it 
disproportionately 
harms 

communities of color. AAPD has 
recently been the subject of public 
scrutiny as the city attempts 
to 
implement 
accountability 

measures—almost 
four 
years 

ago, a white AAPD officer shot 
and killed Aura Rosser, a Black 
Ann Arbor resident. Earlier in 
February, City Council passed a 
resolution allowing for citizen 
oversight over the formation of a 
police review board. 

After participating in a ride-

along at the Washtenaw County 
Sheriff’s Office, Husain said she 
can understand how the amount 
of freedom police officers are 
granted could affect communities 
of color in unassuming ways.

“I think I had kind of an 

outsider’s perspective of the 
statistical disparities in what 
happens to communities of color 
in dealing with the police and 
what that looks like,” Husain said. 
“But I think seeing how the police 
operate on a day-to-day basis, 
I got a more informed view of 
how that might happen and what 
attitudes might perpetuate that, 
and not even to be too forgiving, 
but it’s not a matter of, ‘Oh, here 
are the police who go out saying 
I’m going to be looking at people 
of color harsher than I am going 
to be looking at your typical white 
citizen.’ I think seeing that from 
the officer’s perspective as well 
is useful, especially if you’re 
working on remedying those 
problems and actually coming up 
with viable solutions.”

Called the arterial everter, it 

could be applied to a multitude 
of procedures including breast 
mastectomies or severely injured

Synovis 
Micro 
Companies 

Alliance Inc., a supplementary 
company owned by Baxter.

The GEM coupler is an appliance 

that works adeptly with veins; 
however, when attempting to sew 
small 
millimeter-sized 
arteries 
 

with extremely dense walls, it can 
make tissue transfers incredibly 
difficult. 
The 
arterial 
everter 

disperses the compact walls over 
the coupler, effectively connecting 
the wide arteries.

Paul 
Cederna, 
a 
professor 

and chief of plastic surgery at 
the University Medical School, 
and Albert Shih, a professor 
of biomedical and mechanical 
engineering, were co-teaching a 
senior-level 
engineering 
design 

course when they realized the 
coupler deficit challenged their 
students to devise a solution.

“The students struggled but then 

they excelled at end and created 
a great design,” Shih said. “Is this 
significant? Yes. You dream about 
your innovation being used by 
someone so it can enact change. 
Eventually it will happen, it hasn’t 
happened yet, but it is in the right 
pathway to reach an impact on 
health care.”

Jeff 
Plott, 
a 
mechanical 

engineering research fellow and 
doctoral student in Shih’s lab, serves 
as the product development mentor 
on the project. Plott revealed the 
trials of the developmental process.

“We started our design process 

with a ton of brainstorming by 
conjuring 
up 
many 
different 

ideas, and then started narrowing 
that down with a combination 
of what we think works versus 
what is feasible to make versus 
how is it going to get through the 
regulatory landscape? We then 
starting thinking more of it; it can 
be something that is commercially 
viable,” Plott said. “You’re kind of 
balancing all of those things. By the 
end of the semester, the students 
had prototyped a device that was a 
first proof of concept. It showed that 
it was possible to flip an artery over 
the pin and that is where we left off.”

Plott then paired with other 

surgeons at the University to 
further evolve the concept and 
transform it into a product that 
could be monetized.

“That device made by the 

students was far away from being 
something that was usable by 
surgeons in the future and also 
something that was manufacturable 
and economically viable,” he said. 
“So, after that semester, I led the 
development of transforming the 
device into something that could 
meet all of these requirements.”

In order to make the transition 

from idea to marketed technology, 
the Coulter Translational Research 
Partnership Program, a sector of 
the Department of Biomedical 
Engineering, 
provided 
funding 

for product design and testing. It 
also gave expert advice to fully 
develop the technology and place it 
 

into the hands of the health care 
business.

Baxter then signed the licensing 

agreement with the University for 
the arterial everter to be accessible 
worldwide. However, Baxter will 
first need to file for Food and Drug 
Administration approval and other 
licenses. 

After working tirelessly with 

students, surgeons and engineers, 
Plott rejoices over the success of the 
technology.

“This licensing agreement is a 

great validation of our idea. Our end 
goal, of course, is always to make a 
difference. This partnership will 
greatly accelerate that path and will 
enable us to get us there as quickly 
as possible,” he said.

LSA SG President Nicholas 

Fadanelli, 
an 
LSA 
senior, 

sponsored the resolution, citing 
the mission of the government 
to serve LSA students and their 
concerns.

“Part of this is not only 

to establish what our stance 
should be, especially given that 
our mission is to actively seek 
the voice of LSA students and 
their interests, but also to grant 
students something where they 
do have a say regarding this,” 
Fadanelli said.

Counsel Nathan Wilson, an 

LSA junior, was also in support of 
the resolution.

“I 
think 
there’s 
some 

disagreement about the question 
on 
the 
merit 
of 
changing 

Michigan time,” Wilson said. 
“The 
opposition 
that 
I’m 

understanding is getting bound 
up into having to oppose the 
replacement of Michigan time 
because 
of 
(an) 
instinctive 

reaction 
from 
students 
and 

that on the merit we should be 
opposing the change to Michigan 
time just for the sake of a guttural 
student instinct. I don’t think that 
this opposition holds true in the 
circumstances like these where 
it is not an issue that students are 

unfamiliar with.”

Elected 
Representative 

Amanda Delekta, an LSA junior, 
raised concerns over the binding 
nature of the proposal and a 
potential lack of representation.

“I think there’s a difference 

between asking a question and 
being bound to their response,” 
Delekta said. “We are in this 
room to discuss these issues 
and have a conversation … it’s 
dangerous to just link yourself 
to that binding question. Also, I 
think we all need to think about 
how though students may be 
educated about Michigan time, 
the number of students who vote 
in our elections is so small, so it’s 
not a representative sample of our 
student body.”

A change.org petition has 

734 signatures as of Wednesday 
evening asking the administration 
to not remove Michigan time, 
citing concerns that professors 
will not end class at the proper 
time and may run over.

“As of May 1, they’re getting 

rid of ‘Michigan Time,’ a long-
standing tradition and travel 
time for students, and shifting it 
to leaving 10 minutes before the 
end of class,” the petition reads. 
“We already know how often 
professors spill over class time 
and this will most likely end in 
students arriving late to their 
other classes and still showing up 

on Michigan Time.”

The organization also voted on 

the proposed topics for the student 
government’s upcoming election 
ballots. These topics include pass/
fail usage, an establishment of 
a General Learning Center and 
residence hall card readers.

Fadanelli 
also 
mentioned 

LSA 
SG 
will 
meet 
with 

University officials regarding the 
University’s 
endowment 
fund 

investments. Last month, the 
Detroit Free Press released an 
investigative report stating the 
University invested $4 billion of 
its $11 billion endowment into 
global projects by top donors. The 
Free Press is now in a legal battle 
with the University regarding this 
report.

“It’s the belief of LSA student 

government that if there is 
no issue like the University is 
claiming, having an investigation 
just to show the public, because 
this is a public institution, that 
everything is up to code would 
clear the University’s name,” 
Fadanelli said.

Two 
resolutions 
were 

also proposed. One included 
allocating $500 to LSA facilities 
to install a water refill station 
in Haven Hall, while the other 
will make an amendment to the 
student government’s bylaws to 
standardize the designation of 
subcommittees.

“If you know your history, then 

people can’t give it back to you in 
the wrong form,” French said.

Lecturer Anne Berg explained 

how 
the 
Nazi 
party 
used 

fabricated scientific claims to 
promote and encourage racism 
in Germany and compared this to 
the current eugenics argument. 
 

In this respect, she admitted 
society today is not too different 
from Nazi Germany.

This past fall, protests broke 

out across campus as students 
groups called on the University 
to change the name of C.C. Little 
building and bus stop, as their 
namesake was a former University 
president and President of the 
American Eugenics Society. 

“Nazis were lucky that they 

had so much of a rich history of 
scientific evidence and visual 
legacies to draw on to build a 
racial state that thankfully has 
not yet been paralleled,” Berg 
said.

Associate professor Rudolph 

“Butch” Ware highlighted the 
roots of racism from an Islamic 
perspective 
in 
18th 
century 

Africa. Despite the fact literacy 
rates were higher in regions 
of Africa than in any part of 
Europe, African people were 
nonetheless seen as slaves. Ware 
cited classical Islamic teachings 
that racism stems from pride, 
and urged the audience to set 
their pride aside and engage 
in dialogue to understand how 
white supremacy has occurred 
and what it has done.

Several speakers also focused 

on the historical inaccuracies 
from a national perspective. 

Assistant professor Matthew 

Spooner referenced the Haitian 
revolution and Rebecca J. Scott, 
a Charles Gibson Distinguished 
University professor of history, 
discussed the Reconstruction-
era government of Louisiana to 
highlight the lack of historical 
knowledge many hold, and how 
this ignorance warps views of 
current social problems.

“If we can’t understand the 

past, we will be blind to the 
present,” Spooner said.

Associate professors Stephen 

A. Berrey and assistant professor 
Allan Lumba made clear how 
historical 
interpretations 
of 

racial minorities in the United 
States has contributed to their 
treatment today. Berrey focused 
on the interpretations of African 

Americans and Lumba on Asian 
Americans. Both Berrey and 
Lumba used narratives of racial 
hate crimes to showcase how 
easily the perpetrator can hide 
their motives, and how the real 
story can lie hidden for decades. 

“(This can be fixed) by telling 

our 
stories, 
challenging 
lies, 

hyperboles, 
half-truths, 
and 

fictions,” Barry said.

Geoff Eley, a Karl Pohrt 

Distinguished 
University 

professor 
of 
contemporary 

history, and Prof. Rita Chin 
examined the roots of xenophobia 
and its current presence both 
globally and nationally. Chin 
discredited the widespread belief 
that xenophobia toward Muslims 
in Europe dates to before 9/11, and 
Eley explained how globalization 
has created anxieties it originally 
aimed to abolish. Eley argued 

against the common positive 
interpretation of globalization, 
stating the combined effects of 
globalization lead to warfare-
related destruction, encouraging 
the massive migration of peoples.

“(The) global creation of a 

borderless world drive people to 
want to create borders at home,” 
Eley said.

vice 
president 
for 
medical 

affairs, and David Spahlinger, 
executive vice dean for clinical 
affairs, faculty members list 
several reasons for their “deep 
disappointment in the concept 
and rollout of the Victors Care 
Program.”

According 
to 
the 
Victors 

Care 
website, 
services 

include “24 hour access to the 
patient’s physician or covering 
physician via telephone, text, 
or email, Same or next day 
appointments, Unhurried visits, 
A yearly executive style physical 
examination, Assistance with 
scheduling tests and specialty 
appointments, 
Minimal 
wait 

times (and) A written summary 
report detailing the doctor’s 
findings and recommendations 
from 
the 
yearly 
physical.” 

There are also several bullet 
points listed for “executive style 
physical examination.”

The 
website 
specifically 

notes memberships purchased 
on or before June 30, 2018 will 
be available for $2,700, or $225 
a month, until June 30, 2019. 
Starting July 1, memberships 
will increase to $3,600 per year. 
All 
memberships 
purchased 

will expire in July 2019, when 
the annual membership fee for 
all members will become the 
same. Membership fees are said 
to cover personalized care, take 
place of billing insurance for 
primary care visits and allow 
the organization to limit the 
number of patients physicians 
can treat.

Drawing on the program 

description, grievances listed 
in the faculty letter include: 
being unaware in the content 
of the Victors Care program 
invitation 
letter, 
video 
and 

website; discriminating against 
the underserved; promotional 
materials 
suggesting 
Victors 

Care 
patients 
will 
“receive 

preferential 
treatment 
at 

Michigan Medicine based on 
ability 
to 
pay”; 
implication 

that if receiving Victors Care 

is quality care, receiving care 
from traditional primary care 
physicians is not quality; and 
a concern that Victors Care 
promotional 
materials 
and 

website recommend care that is 
not evidence based.

“We ask that the institution 

stop recruiting our patients to 
this program and advertising it 
as providing much better care 
than all the rest of our primary 
care clinics,” the letter reads. 
“Victors Care purports to offer 
‘better’ health care to those with 
enough money to pay a large 
access fee. The University of 
Michigan is a public institution 
and our commitment is to serve 
the public, not a private few.”

The letter also includes direct 

quotations 
from 
Michigan 

Medicine faculty, one of which 
notes: “This reinforces UM as 
an elitist institution catering 
to the wealthy.” The letter has 
since been signed by more than 
200 Michigan Medicine faculty 
members.

Masson, 
however, 
claims 

Victors Care supports equal 

access to health care.

“We’re committed to ethical, 

accessible 
care 
for 
all 
our 

patients and whatever programs 
we put in place should not 
diminish that in any way. This 
will not adversely affect the 
access of other patients to our 
outstanding health care system,” 
Masson wrote in her statement. 

Efforts 
to 
contact 
Runge 

and program organizer Kim 
Eagle, an Albion Walter Hewlett 
professor of internal medicine, 
were forwarded to Michigan 
Medicine spokespeople.

“Some faculty and staff have 

raised concerns,” Masson wrote. 
“We’ve listened to them and are 
working together to come up 
with solutions that are mutually 
satisfactory for the benefit of our 
patients.”

Daniel 
Berland, 
associate 

professor of internal medicine, 
voiced his disappointment in the 
program.

Progressivism and pacing

The complicity of silence

L

ast week, the California 
Democrats 
convened 

in Sacramento to draft 

and vote on their statewide party 
platform in advance of the 2018 
midterm elections. They adopted 
a platform not too different from 
the one Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., ran on in 2016 — access to 
universal health care as a human 
right, a $15 minimum wage, 
corporate regulation and paid 
family leave. Other planks in the 
28-page manifesto, however, were 
much less familiar. Sizing up this 
document in the context of where 
Democrats are winning right now 
underlines the single greatest 
obstacle for progressive politics in 
the U.S. today — pacing.

According to the document, 

California Democrats will support 
“abolishing the Electoral College 
and (replacing it) with a national 
popular vote.” They will also seek 
full public funding of campaigns 
in local, state and federal elections 
to oppose the “culture of cronyism 
and corruption” as well as the 
immediate repeal of the post-9/11 
legislation, Authorization for the 
Use of Military Force. Finally, 
they advocate for publicly-owned 
affordable housing projects and the 
creation of publicly-owned, “non-
competitive” Internet providers.

As a progressive, my initial 

reaction is that whoever wrote this 
platform should be thrown a parade. 
Finally, a bold and articulate vision 
that is not only morally right, but one 
on which progressive candidates 
can win. In 2016, Democrats 
sold Hillary Rodham Clinton as 
President Barack Obama’s follow-
up act, a continuation of everything 
that was going right in our country. 
This new progressive vision came in 
the rare absence of a predominant 
negative motivation, “Don’t vote 
for the clown who grabs women by 
the crotch.” Finally, some positive 
motivation to go to the polls. Voting 
for instead of voting against.

Several hours later, as I was 

scrolling through Twitter, the 
political talking heads were fixated 

on one thing: Texas turning blue. 
This included Democratic Rep. 
Beto O’Rourke’s momentum in his 
challenge for Ted Cruz’s Senate 
seat, demographic shifts in Texas 
and how Clinton lost the state by a 
smaller margin than any Democrat 
since 1996. Could this Republican 
Party stronghold finally be in play 
this year? This kind of speculation 
has been everywhere for the past 
two years, as Democrats make 
gains in unlikely places — Alabama, 
Georgia 
and 
even 
Oklahoma. 

Surely, running as a Democrat in 
California is wildly different from 
running as a Democrat anywhere in 
the South. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., 
cannot win with the progressivism 
of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. So, 
what do these divergent positions 
mean for the Party, if and when 
it wins congressional majorities? 
What does it mean for the selection 
of a presidential candidate in two 
years’ time?

Two kinds of Democrats are 

starting to emerge, both drawing 
from Sanders’ rhetoric and style, 
but wildly different in terms of 
pacing. On the one hand, there 
are the motivated progressives, in 
places like California, Oregon, New 
Jersey and Massachusetts. They’re 
ready to staple this platform to 
their foreheads and move full-
steam ahead. On the other, there 
are 
popular 
progressives, 
in 

places that are not quite ready 
for everything in the 28 pages of 
the California platform but who 
will be ready to take steps in that 
direction. These were Sanders 
voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and 
Ohio — the people who can be sold 
on single-payer health care and 
legalized marijuana, but need a 
little time.

Reactionary instincts to too 

much change in too little time 
are real. It is not a coincidence 
that 
a 
presidential 
campaign 

based on making America great 
again came on the heels of our 
first Black president and eight 
years that saw the legalization 
of 
gay 
marriage, 
mainstream 

portrayals of transgender people 
and a spotlight on safe spaces 
on college campuses. For a lot of 
people, it was overwhelming and 
the world motivated progressives 
are pushing for threatens to have 
the exact same effect. Agree with 
it as you like, but no one can deny 
the contents of that document 
represents substantial change to 
how we think about rights, the 
differences between public or 
private, and how elections work in 
this country.

So, if you were the grand 

marshal of American progressives, 
what would you do? Lean into 
this 28-page left-wing dream 
of a mission statement and risk 
alienating potential voters in 
states showing signs of progress? 
Or pump the brakes and wait 
for the popular progressives to 
catch up, despite the fact this is 
somewhat 
counterintuitive 
to 

what you stand for?

Fundamentally, 2018 is an 

exciting year to be a progressive. 
The platform is exciting and has so 
much potential. What was once a 
subset of the Democratic Party 
is now its vanguard, pushing left 
and angling for congressional 
majorities. At the same time, 
liberal candidates seem poised to 
win in places they haven’t won in 
half a century.

For now, I see no problem with 

offering this document to the 468 
congressional candidates who will 
have D’s next to their names this 
fall as a sort of buffet. Pick and 
choose. Find the pace that is right 
for your state or your district. But 
set a tone. Make change at the local 
level that starts the wave, slow and 
steady. Because very soon, we’re 
going to see a major presidential 
nominee with this platform stapled 
to his or her forehead, ready to 
spread it to all 50 states. And if 
these two brands of progressivism 
are too far out of step, that could 
spell trouble.

BRETT GRAHAM | COLUMN

STEVE SMITH | OP-ED

I

n 
today’s 
world, 
we’ve 

arrived at a place where 
our opinions and values are 

interpreted through the lens of 
“right versus left” or “liberal 
versus conservative.” We allow 
these lenses to force us to pick 
a side, and in picking a side we 
forget that dialogue occurs so 
we can grow, exchange ideas and 
possibly contribute to society’s 
advancement.

Before becoming a graduate 

student at the University of 
Michigan, I directed a successful 
state representative (Republican) 
campaign in Northern Michigan. 
I’ve voted for Democrats (including 
for President Barack Obama twice 
and Hillary Clinton). I’m all about 
pro-choice, fixing health care and 
infrastructure, supporting unions, 
equal 
rights/pay 
and 
moving 

society forward. I’m also a veteran 
who spent almost eight years on 
active duty, who had to carry a 
gun on occasion and respected the 
privilege of carrying that power by 
my side.

Now that I’ve said all that, 

I need to say this: Your silence 
on gun control or your support 
of the current administration’s 
performance 
is 
a 
form 
of 

complicity. It’s not a right versus 
left issue. The controversy in our 
country surrounding guns is on 
each of us. It’s not about being pro-
Second Amendment. It’s about us 
moving toward a better society 
and taking care of those we care 
about. By that nature, if we make 
a choice not to participate in this 
discussion, not to play an active 
role in bettering our society, then 
we are the complicit in lives that 
are lost. Our silence is complicity.

In the military, across the five 

armed service branches, over the 
last 10 years, there’s been a huge 
emphasis on preventing sexual 
assault. It’s a good focus with a solid 
message. The military is working 
to change its culture. In doing so, 
one of the messages that exists is 
if you see something and you don’t 
say something, you’re a part of the 
guilty party. You could even be 
charged by the Uniformed Code 
of Military Justice. If you could’ve 
prevented a sexual assault and you 
didn’t, then you were a part of what 
went wrong. I am saying here if we 
don’t do what we can to change our 

culture in America, then we’re a 
part of what’s wrong. In the same 
way, if you vote for someone who 
refuses to lift a finger to change 
the gun culture of America, then 
there is blood on their hands, and 
by the very nature of your silence 
or support, your compliance and 
refusal to act, there is blood on 
yours too.

We’ve come to a place in 

America 
where 
we 
need 
to 

examine our conscience and our 
priorities. Can you imagine having 
a child and sending them to school, 
and then one day hearing the 
place they went to learn and grow 
was shot up? Can you imagine the 
dread? The helplessness? The fear? 
I cannot. We need to examine our 
priorities — the right to bear arms 
had some great thought behind 
it when it was originally created, 
but let’s take a minute to think 
about what that means today. If 
you’re an avid supporter of this 
‘right,’ you might believe it exists 
so you can protect yourself from 
the ‘government.’ I have to ask, do 
you have any idea how we wage 
wars today? Through drones and 
computer technology. In addition, 
let’s take a look at a few historical 
examples of social change over the 
last 100 years: the Civil Rights era 
in America; South Africa, Nelson 
Mandela and the end of Apartheid; 
and India’s Independence and 
Mahatma Gandhi. Guns did not 
accomplish any of these.

I agree with the idea of 

creating more funding for mental 
health support. I also despise 
the arguments that “criminals 
will get guns regardless.” Just 
because someone will find their 
way around certain roadblocks 
doesn’t mean society stops trying 
to advance as a whole. It doesn’t 
mean we stop trying to improve 
lives. Do we stop trying to cure 
cancer because people will die 
in the meantime? Do we stop 
wearing seatbelts because people 
will get into car accidents? Do we 
stop fighting racism and classism 
because it’s institutionalized? Do 
we stop trying to save the planet 
because we’re killing it? As Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. once said, 
“We will never be satisfied.”

According 
to 
the 
Oxford 

dictionary, the word “civilize” 
means, “to bring (a place or people) 

to a stage of social, cultural and 
moral 
development 
considered 

to be more advanced.” We are 
supposed to be a ‘civilized’ society 
— which means we are supposed 
to be advanced. Advancing, by the 
very nature of the word, means to 
never actually stop. You don’t stop 
advancing, you don’t stop growing. 
If you do, you perish. Whether as 
a person or a society, that’s why 
social progressivism has worked. 
People and societies, by their very 
nature, must advance to survive.

We 
have 
to 
change 
our 

thinking and the laws in this 
country in regard to guns so we as 
a society can provide a better life 
for those we care about. We need to 
understand that to reload a weapon 
250 years ago could have taken 
more than 90 seconds after a single 
shot, whereas today it’s different. 
We need to civilize. And do you 
know why? Because the right to 
shoot 45 rounds per minute does 
not negate the right for a beautiful 
little person to go to school without 
fear. Because our children, our 
sisters and brothers, our cousins, 
our friends and our families are 
counting on us to get this right.

We’ve stopped listening to each 

other in the name of our ideological 
stances, but not all issues have 
be right versus left. Survival and 
advancement shouldn’t be right 
versus left. If there’s elected 
leadership that refuses to take 
action to make our country a 
better, safer place, then it is our 
responsibility to lead that change. 
We have to work to create a more 
perfect union. That work never 
stops, and it doesn’t start with 
arming teachers, putting veterans 
at every school or surrounding 
schools with police officers. None 
of that forces us to take a look 
at ourselves. Guns are playing a 
role in the deaths of our children 
at schools. Read that again. The 
definition of insanity is doing 
the same thing over and over 
again and expecting a different 
result. Our silence is perpetuating 
our insanity; our complicity is 
allowing our insanity to wreak 
havoc on our country. How long 
will we remain complicit?

Steve Smith is a Rackham 

graduate student in Sports 

Management.

A 

s of late, few topics have 
stirred more controversy 
and ignited more debate 

here at the University of Michigan 
than free speech. However, the 
real fight has only begun, as figures 
like Richard Spencer expose an 
increasingly dangerous shift in 
American 
opinion 
regarding 

hate speech. While calls to deny 
Spencer’s request to speak at 
the University aim to prevent 
the elevation of his vile white 
supremacist ideology, they also 
represent a far larger threat to the 
First Amendment. 

The 
First 
Amendment, 

though often touted in defense 
of personal opinion and creative 
expression, was not written with 
the comfort of individuals, or even 
the majority of individuals, in 
mind. On the contrary, it protects 
even reprehensible and unpopular 
opinions, 
precisely 
because 

the authors of the Constitution 
understood the protection of all 
speech as contingent to the survival 
of free society.

Therefore, while suppressing 

Spencer 
may 
be 
the 
more 

palatable option for the University 
community today, it would create 
a slippery slope enabling the 
government to later strangle other 
ideas and beliefs.

To 
anyone 
claiming 
the 

government could indeed aptly 
define and exclude “hate” while 
still protecting “valid” forms of 
expression, consider that the most 
prominent 
white 
supremacist 

groups in America currently muster 
a combined membership of slightly 
under 15,000, most definitely 
representing an unpopular set of 
beliefs in a country of over 320 
million citizens. Comparably, in 
1950, only about 50,000 Americans 
were registered members of the 
Communist Party. Considering the 
context of the Cold War at the time, 
communism in 1950 possessed 
similar minority standing and 
attracted similar antipathy as white 
supremacist ideology does today in 
America (notwithstanding implicit 
endorsement by the president, but 
that’s a matter for another Op-Ed).

Then, as is the case today, 

Americans were faced with the 
option 
of 
marginalizing 
and 

stymieing the minority ideology, 
with the unpopularity and rarity 
of communist faith providing 
the motive and the means to 
do 
so. 
The 
unchecked 
and 

destructive violation of privacy 
rights and ideological freedom 
that followed clearly illustrates 
the consequences of labeling 
unpopular, even harmful, beliefs 
as unworthy of protection.

Opponents of Spencer’s right 

to speak at the University may, 
however, single out the University 
as entirely different from other 
public domains, emphasizing that 
the University must serve the 
needs of its students first. These 
“needs” would assumedly preclude 
the 
presence 
of 
emotionally 

burdensome hate speech and the 
onus of additional security costs 
that 
accompany 
controversial 

speakers like Spencer.

While 
not 
inherently 

unfounded, 
as 
limitations 
on 

certain forms of speech do exist 
when other rights are harmed, 
these “needs” do not serve a higher 
public interest than the protection 
of speech.

In addition to having absolutely 

no constitutional basis, protection 
from the content of speech alone 
reflects a disturbing trend in 
public 
opinion. 
Past 
decades 

saw progressive Americans rally 
against censorship by university 
administrations, in the hope that 
students would enjoy the diversity 
of thought conducive to a liberal 
education. Among other factors, 
the 
increasing 
dominance 
of 

intellectual spheres by identity 
politics has created a college 
student body that is now overly 
sensitive to differing viewpoints. 
This might help explain the 
shocking two-fifths of Americans 
who believe the government should 
take action to prevent hate speech.

Not only does this statistic 

reflect a distorted conception 
of the First Amendment, but it 
reveals a misguided approach to 
addressing hate.

While the First Amendment 

protects 
hate 
speech, 
it 

simultaneously 
equips 
society 

with the ability to address and 
defeat these flawed ideologies 
by providing an open forum for 
rational argument. The only way 
Spencer’s views can possibly be 
dismantled is if those equipped to 
defeat him are open for debate, not 
closed off to it.

Other calls for censorship 

center 
on 
the 
potential 
for 

Spencer’s speech to inspire future 
violence and discrimination, but 
fail to address the distinction 
between speech that directly and 
immediately incites illegal activity, 
which is already prohibited, and 
simply hateful rhetoric, which 
enjoys the protection from liability 
that includes all other forms of 
legal speech.

Morever, the onus of additional 

security costs for any speech by 
Spencer, though potentially hefty, 
still fails to present a compelling 
argument for limiting his rights.

As a public university, the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
does 

not only have a paternalistic 
obligation to its students, but also 
an obligation to assist in protecting 
vested public interests, including 
free speech. Security costs can be 
mitigated in a variety of ways, and 
the University has been well within 
its right as it has pursued such 
restraints on Spencer as selection 
of date and location for his speech. 
Protecting civil liberties does 
not always come cheap.

It is easy to defend speech 

when it is normal, popular or 
uplifting, but society is tested when 
the speech in question is despised, 
offensive or even hateful. Spencer’s 
request to speak at this University 
is a test of our will to maintain the 
sanctity of free speech enshrined in 
the Constitution. Calls for Spencer 
to be denied, however well-
intentioned, fail to realize that the 
First Amendment’s contribution 
to democracy lies in its universal 
application. Let Spencer speak.

Akienreh Johnson was ready 

to let her frustration out into the 
open.

Johnson had torn her ACL in 

the midst of the 2016-17 season, 
then gotten cleared in time for 
the start of the season. She had 
put in the work in practice and 
extra workouts. And she wasn’t 
seeing the results.

The sophomore guard met 

with 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes Arico not about playing 
time, but about finding a way to 
start seeing the returns on those 
hours.

“AK, you’re doing great,” 

she recalled being assured by 
Barnes 
Arico 
and 
assistant 

coach Melanie Moore. “Just 
keep working, like, your time 
will come.”

Cliches and platitudes aren’t 

the most reassuring thing. There 
turned out to be some truth to 
them this time.

The door opened for Johnson 

the following week at Breslin 
Center, in the midst of an 
upset loss to Michigan State. 
Freshman 
forward 
Hailey 

Brown went down with a leg 
injury and Johnson’s name was 
called as much out of necessity 
as want. Three days later, at 
Minnesota, she would be in the 
rotation.

Johnson had played just 12 

minutes in the last six games, 
sitting on the bench for the 
duration of four. When she got 
on the floor during that span, 
it was a stream of errors — a 
turnover, a missed shot, a long 
walk back to the bench.

“Okay, I know I haven’t been 

playing but I have to make sure 
I know the plays,” Johnson 
told herself before the trip to 
Minneapolis. “Have to make 
sure I know multiple positions, 
have to make sure I was ready.”

26 minutes and 19 points later, 

it was clear she had done at least 
that much.

As 
the 
Wolverines 
await 

a 
likely 
bid 

to 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament, 
Johnson 
has 

emerged 
seemingly 
out 

of nowhere as a 
go-to scorer. The 
contest 
against 

the 
Golden 

Gophers was the 
first sign.

After the game 

— a 93-87 loss for the Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
— 

Johnson’s 
teammates 
were 

impressed her output. She didn’t 
even realize how well she had 
played.

“All I know 

is 
that 
we 

lost,” 
Johnson 

said. “So after 
the 
game, 
my 

teammates 
told 

me, 
they 
said, 

‘You know you 
had 19 points.’ 
And 
I 
was 

like, ‘Really?’ I 
thought 
I 
had 

like, 
seven 
or 

eight.”

With that, something clicked.
Johnson was already coning 

off a torn ACL when she came 
to Michigan, having suffered 
the same injury during her 
senior year at Rogers High 
School. When her knee twisted 
the wrong way during an early 
morning practice in 2016, she 
didn’t even realize she had torn 
it again.

“I went like a week walking 

around on it thinking I was 
gonna come back to playing,” 
Johnson said. “Until I got my 
MRI.”

The 
second 
time 
around, 

Johnson’s rehab was longer than 
before, but she knew what was 
coming. When her knee didn’t 
bend, she knew it eventually 

would. When she still couldn’t 
walk, she knew she eventually 
would.

Even so, there 

were anxieties in 
returning. It took 
Johnson 
time 

to trust a knee 
that had twice 
suffered such a 
serious injury.

“I would like 

fall — and I’d be 
completely fine, 
like I wouldn’t be 
hurt — I would 
just fall,” Johnson said. “And I 
would have to sit out (of practice) 
because I was just nervous.”

With the sole exception of a 

midseason stretch filled mostly 
with non-conference blowouts, 
Johnson 
played 
sparingly. 

Whether she got on the floor 
for one minute or 20, though, 
her parents gave her feedback. 
If 
possible, 
Johnson 
would 

watch back the tape with them. 
If not, they’d watch it and give 
her 
feedback 
— 
constantly 

reminding Johnson of how far 
she’d come to be on the court at 
all.

“It’s like a really positive 

thing and they just wanna keep 
my head up,” Johnson said. 
“Because sometimes, you know, 
you get down on yourself if you 
don’t play.”

After 
taking 
off 
against 

Minnesota, Johnson has stayed 
in orbit. She played the hero on 
Senior Night, hitting a 3-point 
dagger 
against 
then-No. 
13 

Maryland to cap a 17-point 
performance, a shot she says 
she knew was going in before 
ever touching the ball. Johnson 
joked that night her success 
was 
because 
the 
Terrapins 

hadn’t included her on the 
scouting report. At the Big 
Ten Tournament, Penn State’s 
players shouted “Right driver!” 
every time she touched the ball. 
Johnson scored 13 on 5-of-9 
shooting in a blowout victory for 
the Wolverines anyway, driving 
whichever way she pleased.

Now, 
there 

are 
no 
more 

frustrations. 
Johnson 
has 

an 
easygoing 

demeanor about 
her as she sits 
in 
the 
Crisler 

Center’s 
media 

room 
after 

practice.

“I know that 

I can get to the 

basket either if they know what 
I’m gonna do or not,” she says. 
“... I know that I can score.”

The sophomore guard has recovered from two torn ACLs in the past three seasons and now plays a big role for Michigan
After frustrating season, Johnson emerges as key scorer for Wolverines

ETHAN SEARS

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

Sophomore guard Akienreh Johnson has developed into a potent scoring threat for Michigan down the final stretch of this season.

She didn’t even 

realize how 
well she had 

played.

“I would 

have to sit out 
because I was 
just nervous.”

Final stretch leads back to Ohio State

P

redictions are a funny 
thing.

Of course, they must 

first be based 
off some 
prior knowl-
edge, oth-
erwise they 
would have 
little cred-
ibility.

Before 

the season 
started, the 
odds were 
not in the 
Michigan hockey team’s favor. 
After an ugly 2016-17 season, 
in addition to a head coaching 
change for the first time in 33 
years, the team seemed likely 
to head into a transition year. 
In that regard, the Wolverines’ 
projected finish of second-to-
last in the Big Ten Preseason 
Coaches Poll was a fair one.

At the same time, predic-

tions are, at best, guesses.

And with a season as long as 

that of collegiate hockey — a 
late-September to April mara-
thon for teams who make the 
postseason — these forecasts 
seem even more arbitrary.

But from the start, despite 

scrutiny, this team was always 
the biggest advocate for itself.

“Coming into the season, 

we knew we were going to be 
good,” said senior forward 
Dexter Dancs. “I know a lot of 
people in the media and outsid-
ers were kind of saying ‘This is 
a transition year.’ ... But that’s 
not what we were thinking. We 
were thinking we were going to 
be in the spot that we are now.”

And ‘transition’ certainly 

wasn’t in this team’s vocabu-
lary. Come January, any 
remaining critics had been 
quieted after Michigan rattled 
off four straight wins against 
ranked opponents in Min-
nesota and Penn State. Come 
February, it had swept Notre 
Dame, the then-No. 1 team in 
the nation, and become a rel-
evant player in the NCAA tour-
nament conversation.

The Wolverines have done 

what they came to do this sea-
son, all while shocking those 
who watched an accelerated 
transformation unfold, partic-
ularly with the offensive unit.

Tony Calderone led the Wol-

verines’ offense last season 
with a mere 15 goals. This year, 
the senior forward has already 
scored 23 goals among his 39 
total points. Calderone is best-
ed by junior linemate Cooper 
Marody who led the Big Ten 
with 44 points — an amount 
over double that of any individ-
ual on the roster last season.

Michigan, which finished 

37th in the PairWise Rankings 
last season, now sits tied for 
No. 7 — a position that almost 
assuredly locks in a tourna-
ment bid come the Selection 
Show on March 18.

But make no mistake — 

while the Wolverines’ season 
won’t come to an end regard-
less of what happens this 
weekend, by no means does 
that make it any less impor-
tant.

There is only one Big Ten 

team Michigan hasn’t defeated 
yet this season. It is the same 
team it will face Saturday in 
the semifinal 
round of the Big 
Ten Tourna-
ment. Oh, and 
it happens to be 
the Wolverines’ 
most notorious 
rival, as well.

Don’t get me 

wrong, Michi-
gan doesn’t 
have to do any-
thing more to 
prove itself this season. It will, 
barring an unforeseen circum-
stance, have a chance at a run 
in the NCAA Tournament. An 
exit in the semifinal round of 
the conference tournament 
certainly would not mar their 
already rewarding season. 

But defeating Ohio State 

this weekend would put the 
Wolverines over one final 
hump. A victory in the first 

round of single-elimination 
play would undoubtedly spur 
postseason momentum. A vic-
tory would put them one game 
away from a Big Ten Tourna-
ment championship. And as 
Michigan has defeated both 
the Nittany Lions and Fighting 
Irish this season, claiming the 
title would hardly be incon-
ceivable at that point.

Getting through this week-

end, though, is going to be a 
taller task. The Buckeyes have 
defeated the Wolverines in all 
four of their meetings during 
the regular season, mostly 
doing so with ease.

But as the cliché goes, the 

postseason is a whole differ-
ent ballgame. At practice this 
week, Mel Pearson provided 
his team with a personal anec-
dote to highlight this phenom-
enon.

During his tenure as an 

assistant coach for Michigan, 
Pearson recalled the senior 
year of Brian Wiseman and 
Steve Shields — two members 
of his current coaching staff. 
The Wolverines had played 
and defeated Lake Superior 
State five times during the 
regular season.

“We played 

them again in 
the regional 
final, up at 
Munn Ice Arena 
in Lansing, and 
the winner went 
on to the Frozen 
Four,” Pearson 
described. “And 
they beat us 
in overtime. … 
Lake Superior 

went onto win the national 
championship, and we had 
beaten them five times.

“We know we haven’t 

beaten (Ohio State), but we get 
another kick at the can.”

Maybe the fifth time will be 

the charm.

season, we knew 

we were going to

Maurice Hurst’s NFL Draft 

Combine didn’t go the way he 
planned.

The former Michigan defensive 

tackle didn’t run the 40-yard dash 
or get on the bench press. He 
was held out of every drill due to 
an irregular electrocardiogram, 
which 
measures 
electrical 

activity in the heart. Despite 
being cleared from the same 

issue by the Wolverines, per NFL 
Network, Hurst’s draft stock has, 
at least temporarily, taken a hit. 

That much is out of his control. 

If Hurst is eventually cleared, 
as he expects, according to Kim 
Jones, the part he can control — 

his play on the field — makes him 
a first-round pick.

Hurst has elite get-off speed 

and a quick twitch from the line 
of scrimmage. His 6-foot-1 height 
ranks in the 17th percentile for 
incoming defensive tackles, his 
292-pound weight the 15th, per 
MockDraftable, but Hurst has 
turned it into an asset. He can fire 
off the line of scrimmage with 
gusto, consistently creating easy 
leverage that turns into pressure. 

Michigan 
defensive 

coordinator Don Brown utilized 
Hurst last season by consistently 
moving him around the line of 
scrimmage and stunting — having 
him start a play lining up over one 
gap, then moving to another after 
the ball was snapped. Hurst’s 
versatility is a major asset at the 
next level. Though I’d argue he 
fits best playing at 1-technique — 
shading the inside shoulder of the 
guard — you could easily get away 
with playing him at 3-technique, 
on the outside shoulder of the 
guard. Brown did both and got 
results, as well as lining Hurst 
up at nose tackle regularly and 
4i-technique on occasion.

Hurst’s run defense is a tad 

more refined than his pass 
rushing. Once he gets leverage, 
Hurst can easily control any 
blocker, putting in grade-A work 

with his hands and moving off 
linemen when the time comes. 
His most impressive plays on tape 
last year came when opponents 
ran inside zone, which calls for 
double-teaming interior linemen. 
Hurst often plowed through the 
double-team and stuffed the 
running back before he could get 
anywhere. That could change in 
the NFL, where the linemen are 
bigger and more precise with 
their blocks, falling off less often, 
but Hurst has still shown an 
uncanny ability to shed double 
teams throughout his career.

It’s hard to find a flaw in 

Hurst’s run defense. His size 
may give teams some pause as 
to whether he can fill space in 
the middle of the line the way a 
1-technique traditionally does. 
Compare him to 6-foot-5, 332-
pound Vita Vea — the likely top 
pick at defensive tackle — and 
that’s 
understandable. 
But 
it 

didn’t seem to matter on tape. 

Hurst’s speed allows him to 

make plays you rarely see from 
interior linemen. He can fly across 
the field to shut down a screen 
and has the sort of determination 
scouts love, never giving up on a 
play.

As a pass rusher, there’s some 

development left for Hurst. He 
consistently goes to the same tune 

— firing into the A or B-gap and 
hitting some poor unsuspecting 
guard with a swim move or hand-
swipe. That worked wonders 
for him in college. In the NFL, 
though, opposing linemen will be 
ready for it.

That doesn’t mean the swim 

move won’t work in the NFL. 
You could make a mixtape from 
the success Hurst had with it 
in college, and it’s completely 
unstoppable if the guard can’t 
shuffle to the gap quickly enough.

When Hurst did break out 

other moves, he had varied 
success. He could easily turn his 
bull rush into a weapon, but it isn’t 
there yet. Whether the bull rush 
develops will depend on whether 
Hurst learns to convert speed 
into power. Right now, it’s an area 
where being undersized makes 
a difference, as it’s tough for 
Hurst to create leverage rushing 
with the sheer force a bull rush 
requires. 

Hurst is going to have success 

in the NFL, assuming his medical 
situation gets sorted out. He 
should 
be 
an 
effective 
run 

defender almost immediately. Size 
will keep him from going too high 
in the first round, but if he turns 
out to be the best defensive tackle 
in this draft class, it shouldn’t be a 
surprise to anybody.

Notebook: Livers OK after ankle injury, ‘M’ moving up in bracket projections

Asked about where he thinks 

Michigan deserves to be seeded, 
fifth-year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson instead summoned a 
different sport — with a much 
smaller ball — for comparison.

“There’s a week left, so there’s a 

lot of moving pieces still,” Robinson 
said after winning the Big Ten 
Tournament on Sunday evening. 
“But we’re in the clubhouse, I guess 
you could say.”

And if the No. 7 Michigan men’s 

basketball team is comfortably 
perched in the clubhouse, it is 
waiting anxiously as the rest of 
college hoops makes the turn down 
the back nine.

Sunday evening, the 68-team 

NCAA Tournament field will be 
unveiled, and the Wolverines will 
head back out on the course. And 
after a torrid run through the Big 
Ten Tournament last week, their 
stock is soaring in many bracket 
projections.

Joe Lunardi, ESPN’s leading 

bracketologist, has Michigan as 
a 3 seed in the East region. Jerry 
Palm of CBS Sports penciled in the 
Wolverines as a 4 seed in the South 
region. 

BracketMatrix.com 
— 
a 

website that compiles a total of 
102 different bracket projections 
— currently lists Michigan as the 
final No. 3 seed, with an average 
seeding of 3.22.

Michigan 
currently 
sits 
at 

13th in RPI with a 6-5 record in 
“Quadrant I” games — matchups 
against RPI top-25 teams at home, 
top-50 on neutral sites and top-75 
on the road. The quadrant system 
is a new criteria the committee is 
expected to utilize this season for 
the first time — a quantitative way 
to evaluate “good wins” and “bad 
losses” and place a weighted value 
on winning away from home.

Regardless of the seed line, 

though, the Wolverines will be a 
group any NCAA Tournament-
bound teams will hope to avoid in 
their bracket come Sunday evening.

“We have Michigan as a No. 3 

seed,” Sports Illustrated’s current 
bracket projection reads, “but 
even if they end up as a No. 4, or 
somehow a No. 5, they’re going to 
be a team no top seed will want to 
see in its region.”

Livers 
(ankle) 
expects 

to be ready for the NCAA 
Tournament

When freshman forward Isaiah 

Livers lay near midcourt just over a 
minute into the second half against 
Purdue, the worst-case scenario 
rushed to mind.

Cutting toward the ball to 

receive an inbounds pass, Livers 
stepped on the foot of Boilermaker 
forward Vincent Edwards and 
immediately fell to the ground, 
grabbing his left ankle, clearly in 
agonizing pain.

“I 
must 
have 
overstrided,” 

Livers said after the game, “and I 
stepped on his foot and pushed off.”

Livers made his way to the 

locker room shortly after, limping 

noticeably on his way down the 
tunnel.

The freshman first sprained his 

ankle in an early February loss at 
Northwestern. He returned eight 
days later against Iowa, missing 
only one game.

The trainers told him Sunday’s 

injury was similar to the one he 
suffered against the Wildcats, 
though he told reporters the pain 
was worse.

And while instant reactions 

seemed grim, it seems the injury 
is not as bad as it may have initially 
seemed. Livers came back to the 
bench midway through the second 
half, though he did not play the final 
19 minutes of the championship 
bout.

“I could (have gone back in),” 

Livers said. “Duncan (Robinson) 
was just playing good.”

After the game, Livers vowed 

to 
be 
ready 
for 
the NCAA 

Tournament. Aided by the extra 

week off, he will, at minimum, 
have 10 days to regain his health in 
preparation for the Tournament.

Livers took over as the starter 

at the ‘4’ in mid-January against 
Michigan 
State 
and 
hasn’t 

relinquished it since. While he 
remains the starter — and likely 
will the rest of the season, health 
permitting — due to his defensive 
capabilities 
and 
rebounding 

prowess, 
the 
freshman 
has 

increasingly ceded minutes to 
fifth-year senior Duncan Robinson. 
Robinson has eclipsed Livers’ 
total in minutes in all of the last 
12 games, including each Big Ten 
Tournament contest.

The case for Detroit
The third round of Michigan-

Michigan State might be slated for 
Sunday afternoon, just not on the 
court this time.

The 
Wolverines 
dispatched 

the Spartans in the Big Ten 
Tournament semifinal Saturday 

afternoon, completing the sweep of 
their in-state foe.

But with Detroit slated to be 

one of the first-round sites of the 
NCAA Tournament next weekend, 
the battle of the two résumés may 
determine who gets to trek tens 
of miles to Little Caesars Arena 
instead of hundreds or even 
thousands.

This year, the NCAA has 

re-emphasized 
a 
desire 
to 

accomodate teams and their most 
convenient travel situations.

Lunardi affirmed this in his 

Bracketology page FAQ.

“For the 16th time, the NCAA 

men’s basketball committee will 
not predetermine the regional 
designation of each of the eight 
sub-regional sites (what it calls 
the 
“pod” 
system),” 
Lunardi 

writes. “This gives the committee 
increased flexibility to reduce 
travel for teams and fans, as well 
as create more local interest at 

sub-regional sites that may not be 
traditional basketball areas. For 
example, the sub regional site in 
Pittsburgh could send its winners 
to Los Angeles (West Regional) 
instead of, say, the East Regional 
in Boston, if the committee thinks 
it makes more geographic sense for 
the teams involved.”

But given Xavier and Purdue’s 

proximity to Detroit as well, it 
may come down to Michigan 
and Michigan State for that final 
preferential spot.

The Wolverines, of course, 

have beaten the Spartans head-
to-head twice this season, both 
games away from Ann Arbor. They 
are currently 13th in RPI to the 
Spartans’ 15th, have six Quadrant 
I wins to the Spartans’ three, 
played the toughest schedule in 
the Big Ten this year to Spartans’ 
13th-ranked conference strength 
of schedule and, of course, won the 
Big Ten Tournament title.

But it’s not that simple. 
Most bracket projections still 

list Michigan State ahead — with 
that coveted spot in Detroit — for a 
few reasons. For one, the Spartans 
lost just four games all year en 
route to compiling a sparkling 
29-4 record and the regular 
season Big Ten title. Michigan 
State played a far tougher non-
conference schedule, including a 
more notable non-conference win 
over North Carolina, a team the 
Wolverines lost to handily. And to 
top it off, the Spartans haven’t lost 
a game outside Quadrant I all year. 
Michigan State’s marquee non-
conference win is better and they 
have no bad losses, in short.

All of this comes down to what 

the committee values and doesn’t, a 
fruitless task to even ponder. If they 
choose to look at the head-to-head 
matchups and/or RPI, Michigan 
will take precedent. If they want 
the more consistent team, it will be 
Michigan State.

But if you know how the 

selection committee will evaluate 
this — and every — decision, maybe 
you should stop focusing on college 
basketball and start playing the 
lottery.

Coming out of our cage: Fifteen years later, the 
‘Mr. Brightside’ phenomenon persists on campuses

As I walked toward the 
Greenwood block party last 
September, just as it seemed 
like it was about over, a familiar 
sound caught my ear. Amid the 
echoes of jubilant laughter and 
delirious chatter, I heard the 
unmistakable opening notes 
of “Mr. Brightside,” the debut 
single from Las Vegas quartet 
The Killers. The cluster of 
students streaming out of the 
neighborhood 
belted 
every 
single lyric, word for word, in 
nearly immaculate unison. It 
was mesmerizing, to say the 
least, though not unexpected.
Since I entered college, “Mr. 
Brightside” 
was 
considered 
the go-to anthem catered for 
every and any kind of social 
gathering. There are other 
iconic party jams that remain 
staples within college party 
culture — Fountains of Wayne’s 
“Stacy’s Mom,” Bowling for 
Soup’s “1985” and R. Kelly’s 
“Ignition (Remix)” are some 
well-known favorites. But no 
matter the venue or the time 
of day, “Mr. Brightside” is 
incomparable in how easily it 
can provoke a crowd of people 
to practically lose their shit and 
maintain that level of insanity 
throughout its duration.
While “Mr. Brightside” has 
been in existence since the 
early 2000s, its timelessness 
has 
transformed 
it 
into 
a 
fascinating 
and 
somewhat 
confounding phenomenon. A 
theatrical, triumphant anthem 
about unrequited love is now 
considered by many young 
people to be a millennial classic. 
In addition to being a musical 
marvel, “Mr. Brightside” has 
woven its way into other realms 
of pop culture, most notably 
on Twitter as a series of viral 
memes. It was featured in a 
scene from the 2006 rom-com 
“The Holiday,” where Cameron 
Diaz (“The Mask”) screams 
the lyrics to forget about her 
boyfriend’s infidelity, as well 
as 
a 
memorable 
sequence 
from the second season of 
“The O.C.,” where three of the 
show’s central couples confront 
one another at a rock concert 
— 
The 
Killers 
themselves 
make 
an 
appearance. 
The 
band continues to perform the 
song on tour, unabashedly and 
vigorously so, still capturing 
the hearts of their devoted fans, 
including “Hamilton” creator 
Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Considering 
the 
social, 
cultural and sonic factors at 
play in the song’s runaway 
success, I decided to investigate 
what makes “Mr. Brightside” 
one of the most memorable 
and perennial tracks of the 
21st century and what its 
significance might say about 
the people who cherish it the 
most.
“How did it end up like 
this?”: A brief history of “Mr. 
Brightside.”
The magnitude of the song’s 
appeal can be traced all the way 
back to its beginning. In late 
2001, The Killers’s frontman 
Brandon 
Flowers 
co-wrote 
the 
song 
with 
the 
band’s 
lead guitarist Dave Keuning. 
Inspired by a real-life situation 
in which Flowers discovered 
his then-girlfriend had cheated 
on 
him, 
“Mr. 
Brightside” 
follows a jealous guy and his 
attempt 
to 
reconcile 
with 
knowing his lover has left him 
for another man. Flowers and 
Keuning performed the song 
for the first time at an open mic 
night in Las Vegas’s Cafe Roma, 
a performance that Flowers 
described as “terrible” and 
“awful” in a 2005 Rolling Stone 
interview. Still, that didn’t stop 
the two from recording the 
song’s demo in 2002 (which 
was much grainier and more 
distorted than the original), 
 
and signing with UK indie label 
Lizard King Records. Initially, 
The 
Killers 
achieved 
more 
success in the United Kingdom, 
similar to how Jimi Hendrix 
found his commercial niche in 
England with his band’s 1967 
debut Are You Experienced.
Once 
the 
song 
was 

re-recorded 
and 
re-released 
on the band’s 2004 debut Hot 
Fuss, “Mr. Brightside” finally 
found its calling in the United 
States. The song climbed to 
number 10 on the U.S. Billboard 
charts and became the ninth 
most 
downloaded 
song 
on 
iTunes in 2005. The Killers had 
officially been propelled into 
the mainstream limelight. To 
this day, the song continues to 
be a chart topper; according to 
Noisey, it spent 35 consecutive 
weeks on the U.K. Billboard 
Charts between July 2016 and 
Mar. 2017, reaching its peak 
in three years at number 49 in 
Jan. 2017.
The fact “Mr. Brightside” 
has endured years later and 
resonated with music listeners 
on 
an 
international 
scale 
remains a captivating enigma. 
Much like how the protagonist 
of the song prevails against the 
pain and suffering from losing 
his girlfriend, “Mr. Brightside” 
seems 
to 
have 
prevailed 
against its tumultuous start 
as well. Perhaps the song has 
maintained its success because 
of its unrelenting optimism, its 
ingenuity for its time or, most 
likely, the universal appeal 
of the underdog story at its 
center. Perhaps it’s all those 
things, but it’s worth noting 
“Mr. Brightside” would not be 
nearly as massive without the 
unforgettable lyrics and the 
propulsive beat that drive it.
“Gotta 
gotta 
be 
down 
because I want it all”: The 
lyrics and sound of “Mr. 
Brightside.”
To further understand the 
song’s spellbinding allure, I 
spoke with Ryan Bodiford, 
a University professor who 
teaches Introduction to Popular 
Music 
this 
semester 
and 
specializes in musicology, a field 
that explores the relationships 
between music and its social 
significance. Though the song 
has a relatively conventional 
structure, Bodiford contends 
its attractiveness lies within 
the setup and payoff of its 
sound. 
“The 
whole 
tune 
is 
based 
around 
a 
build-up 
of 
momentum,” 
Bodiford 
said. 
“That 
bridge 
section 
is 
gaining 
momentum, 
the 
melody 
increases 
in 
pitch. 
The harmonies of the tune 
are building a certain tension 
that is released in this massive 
payout of the chorus.”
He also remarks the song 
draws on familiar styles, like 
British rock, pop and new 
wave music. This makes sense, 
especially because at the time of 
the song’s release, The Killers’s 
competition — The Strokes, 
Interpol, 
LCD 
Soundsystem 
and 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeahs 
— 
incorporated those genres as 
well as part of the growing 
NYC rock revival scene. But 
“Mr. Brightside” stands out 
not just for the texture of its 
production, but for the wistful 
feelings it elicits.
Jeff 
Peretz, 
an 
assistant 
arts professor at the New York 
University Clive Davis Institute 
of Recorded Music, spoke about 
the song’s nostalgia and how its 
themes on paranoia, heartbreak 
and jealousy can translate into 
such a satisfying emotional 
release.
“I think (“Mr. Brightside”w) 
gives permission to explore 
those kind of feelings,” Peretz 
said. 
“We 
all 
go 
through 
something similar and to be 
able to shout it out at a party 
out loud has got to be cathartic. 
It gives people a chance to 
celebrate that they’ve been 
through this.” 
It’s no wonder, then, why “Mr. 
Brightside” is considered such 
a desirable tune among college 
students. 
The 
combination 
of Flowers’s lyrical wordplay 
(“Jealousy, turning saints into 
the sea / Swimming through 
sick lullabies, choking on your 
alibis”) with the invigorating, 
major-key rhythm, comprised 
of fiery synths and booming, 
majestic guitar riffs, empowers 
and reassures its audience to 
remain optimistic even in the 
face of rejection, something that 
most young people arguably 
experience on a weekly basis.

That being said, millennials 
aren’t 
the 
only 
ones 
who 
consider 
“Mr. 
Brightside” 
a 
masterful 
earworm. 
In 
Mar. 2016, 45-year-old Brian 
O’Sullivan 
led 
a 
raucous, 
emotional 
rendition 
of 
the 
song at an Irish pub in honor 
of his best friend who had died 
the previous week. The video 
that captured the scene went 
viral, even leading The Killers 
to post about it on Twitter, 
blessing O’Sullivan with their 
seal of approval. In a way, this 
kind of occurrence speaks to 
the song’s remarkable ability 
to transcend intergenerational 
barriers. Everyone, no matter 
what age, experiences some 
form of heartbreak over losing 
something or someone at some 
point in life.
“People feel more open and 
brave to express those kind of 
things,” Peretz said. “Whereas 
maybe they would be the kind 
of things you would keep to 
yourself if it wasn’t for a song 
like this.”
The 
song’s 
distinctive 
repetition also contributes to 
its infectiousness. Elizabeth 
Margulis, a music researcher 
based at the University of 
Arkansas, 
discussed 
the 
cognitive 
implications 
of 
repetition in pop music in a 
recent Vox video. At one point in 
the clip, Margulis deconstructs 
this idea of a “speech to song 
illusion.”
“You can take a little bit of 
speech, repeat it a number of 
times and for many people, 
there’s 
this 
very 
salient 
transformation 
where 
what 
initially 
just 
sounded 
like 
somebody talking to you sounds 
like someone singing,” she said.
“Mr. Brightside” works in 
a similar way; Flowers shouts 
the first verse, pre-chorus and 
chorus, then repeats them in the 
song’s second half, and finally 
ends by wailing “I never” four 
times in a row. According to 
the science behind the “speech 
to song illusion,” the more the 
lyrics are repeated, the catchier 
the track is. It’s why, as Vox 
contributor 
Estelle 
Caswell 
remarks in the video, songs 
like 
Whitney 
Houston’s 
“I 
Wanna Dance With Somebody,” 
Beyoncé’s 
“Formation” 
and 
Michael Jackson’s “Beat It” 
have become such addictive 
pop songs.
“Repetition 
doesn’t 
just 
make the song memorable,” 
Caldwell said when alluding to 
“Formation,” “it reinforces its 
central message.” The same can 
be said about “Mr. Brightside”; 
the song’s repetition supports 
this idea that no matter how 
difficult your circumstances 
may be, everything will be 
alright in the end.
“Destiny is calling me”: 
The cultural impact of “Mr. 
Brightside.”
Even with all this in mind, it’s 
still difficult to ascertain just 
how and why “Mr. Brightside” 
has stayed so popular for so 
long. Why haven’t, say, Hot 
Fuss’s deep cuts “Smile Like 
You Mean It” and “Somebody 
Told Me” or “When You Were 
Young” 
from 
2006’s 
Sam’s 
Town or “Human” from 2008’s 
Day and Age achieved the same 
level of playability? Why “Mr. 
Brightside” specifically?
Some have theorized “Mr. 
Brightside” has accumulated 
so 
much 
commercial 
and 
cultural capital because our 
parents played it for us when 
we were younger. It’s entirely 
probable that listening to “Mr. 
Brightside” 
could 
be 
some 
unconscious form of reclaiming 
that part of our childhood. And 
if not reclaiming our childhood, 
then maybe some type of 
psychological liberation. Others 
believe the song’s long-lasting 
success is due to the trend of 
post-ironic Spotify DJing, the 
comfort of nostalgia or simply 
because it’s a good song. One 
might also think millennials 
relate to the song’s themes of 
infidelity and jealousy because 
they are more prone to cheat 
on 
their 
partners, 
though 
there exists evidence that both 
supports and refutes this claim.
“Popularity is truly elusive,” 
Bodiford 
said. 
“There 
are 

SAM ROSENBERG

things that nobody would’ve 
expected to become massively 
popular. In that case, you have 
to look at social aspects. Is 
it connected to a particular 
moment in time?”
Considering the turbulent 
social moment we’re currently 
living 
in, 
“Mr. 
Brightside” 
can certainly be an antidote 
to 
the 
unshakable 
anxiety 
that 
pervades 
youth 
and 
society at large today. By 
recontextualizing it as a party 
song, “Mr. Brightside” gives its 
listeners the agency and control 
that is so desperately needed 
during these times. Though the 
future remains unpredictable, 
the song’s legacy will hopefully 
stay intact.
“When the song first came 
out, I was like, ‘This is kind of 
cool.’ No one knew which one of 

those bands from that era was 
going to stick around,” Peretz 
recalled. “But this summer, at 
one of the festivals in the city 
(the Global Citizen Festival), 
they played the song and 
everybody went nuts for it. I 
remember being moved by how 
much people appreciated that 
song.”
“Youth is kind of inherently 
optimistic,” 
Bodiford 
said. 
“As you get older, you tend 
to get more jaded. Having a 
very uplifting theme that’s 
connected to music that’s also 
very optimistic and major-key 
and life-affirming … it resonates 
with a common outlook for a lot 
of University students that are 
getting ready to go out in the 
world.”
During the annual Michigan 
State University game last Oct., 

I witnessed this first-hand. 
The Big House decided to play 
“Mr. 
Brightside” 
for 
more 
than 100,000 people. Instead 
of cutting off the song, as they 
tend to do before the next 
play of the football game, they 
played it all the way through, 
letting it reverberate into the 
night as a horde of students 
roared along to the words.
Again, it was a captivating 
sight to see — the rainstorm 
that suddenly washed over the 
crowd made it feel all the more 
epic — but it felt appropriate 
in this context. Despite the 
fact that Michigan was losing 
against MSU, “Mr. Brightside” 
pushed us away from the lure 
of impending disappointment. 
It opened up our eager eyes 
and reminded us that we were 
doing just fine.

The magic community of 
midnight film screenings

FILM NOTEBOOK

My first (and only) experience of 
a midnight screening was for “The 
Room” last fall at the Michigan 
Theater in anticipation of the 
release of “The Disaster Artist.” 
“The Disaster Artist” adapts the 
memoir by Greg Sestero and Tom 
Bissell about their time on the set 
of “The Room” at the mercy of the 
eccentric Tommy Wiseau. As I 
waited in the jam-packed theater 
for the movie to begin, I could tell 
right away that the atmosphere was 
something extraordinary: Loud 
recitations of notorious scenes 
filled the room, several people tried 
to sell me plastic spoons (since the 
Friday-night crowd cleaned house 
at the nearby Walgreens), the musty 
scent of alcohol and marijuana 
came from all directions. Usually, 
only the bottom floor of the 
main auditorium has customers, 
consisting largely of senior citizens 
and film students with plenty of 
seats open. But that night, even the 
balcony level sold out.
Once the film started, the noise 
did not die down. Instead, people 
shouted along to the dialogue and 
chucked their precious plastic 
spoons towards the front, inevitably 
hitting a lot of heads. I started to 
pick up on the bizarre traditions 
that everyone bought into: If you 
see a spoon in the movie, throw a 
real one; if there’s an extended sex 
scene, count the absurd number 
of gyrations; or you yell, “Go! Go! 
Go!” as the camera pans across 
the Golden Gate Bridge — the list 
goes on. At some point, people in 
the back ran out of their arsenal of 
plastic spoons and started racing 
through the aisles and diving onto 
the stage to retrieve more. All this 
passion and frenzy and excitement 
for truly the worst movie ever 
made. In other words, a straight-up 
phenomenon.
Midnight movies, synonymous 
with cult films, began their 
rise in popularity where most 

would expect: New York City. 
The 
independent 
film 
scene 
revolved mostly around certain 
iconic, and now almost all closed, 
arthouse theaters like the Elgin, 
the Waverly and the St. Marks. 
Selections often included cheap 
B-movies, 
corny 
Westerns 
or 
sultry features that addressed 
fetishes and other counterculture 
topics. Most associate the Mexican 

western “El Topo” as the first 
midnight 
movie, 
played 
back 
in 1970 to crowded audiences. 
From “El Topo,” the phenomenon 
spread to embrace dark comedies, 
politically-charged thrillers and, 
oddly enough, a number of movies 
that John Lennon of The Beatles 
loved. However, like all trends, the 
fascination shifted to something 
else, except for one film which has 
outlasted even the theater that 
coaxed it to cult status: “The Rocky 
Horror Picture Show.”
“The Rocky Horror Picture 
Show” is the longest running 
movie in history with a Cinderella 
tale to accompany its cementation 
in popular culture. What started 
as a small theater production 

transformed into an Hollywood 
flop and, miraculously, re-emerged 
as the symbol of fringe society. 
Similar to “The Room,” audience 
participation drives the showings 
with traditions that force places 
like the Michigan Theater to issue 
a ban on rice, confetti, water guns, 
candles, lighters, whole rolls of 
toilet paper, prunes and hot dogs. At 
locations that run the special every 
week, some actors make a career 
participating in Rocky Horror 
shadowcasts. In fact, the state 
of Mich. has three shadowcasts 
that roam around performing for 
riotous fans. As the 1975 motion 
picture plays on a screen, actors 
dressed as the characters dance 
below and react to improved and 
repeated-so-many-times-it’s-
scripted lines from the audience. 
As film critic Roger Ebert wrote, 
“‘THe Rocky Horror Picture Show’ 
is not so much a movie as more of a 
long-running social phenomenon,” 
since “the fans put on a better show 
than anything on the screen.”
Like 
all 
counterculture, 
midnight screenings have become 
a rite of passage, no longer confined 
to an unorthodox, marginalized 
community. Just as aspects of 
hippie 
and 
punk 
subcultures 
infiltrate our everyday lives, so do 
references to cult films: Someone 
humming 
“The 
Time 
Warp,” 
someone patting a puppy’s head 
to say “Hi, doggy.” Who knows 
what films decades later will 
be staples of our culture? Great 
movies nominated for Oscars and 
Golden Globes fall to obscurity, 
but somehow the red lips of “THe 
Rocky Horror Picture Show” and 
the bonkers accent of Johnny from 
“The Room” will live on in grungy 
corners of the country or the most 
mainstream theaters. Midnight 
movies have a timeless power 
over audiences. They entrance us, 
they push the envelope, they don’t 
shy from a deeper truth, but most 
importantly, they welcome. They 
provide a feeling of camaraderie 
and unity, and once you get a taste, 
you’re already in too deep.

You’re a teenager and it’s your 
first day back at school after a 
wonderful summer vacation. 
The air is still warm and your 
excitement about the coming 
year dominates any malevolent 
feelings you may have toward 
the early mornings and the 
monotonous schedule of lower 

education. In the fire drill line, 
you notice Vinny from math 
class last year.
But this isn’t the same Vinny.
He 
looks 
different, 
handsomer. 
Maybe 
it’s 
the 
summer tan — who knows. 
Either way, Vinny is the new talk 
of the town, and you give your 
best 007 impression to sneakily 
slide up a few spots in line to ask 
him about his summer.
In 
elementary 
school, 
everyone 
wanted 
Vinny; 
however, 
once 
the 
middle 
school years hit, Cam was the 
prize and poor Vinny’s stock 
took a tumble. But with this 
new Vinny — this rugged, 
mysterious Vinny who wears 
flannels and has a five o’clock 
shadow — people begin to lose 
interest in clean-cut Cam and 
his hard-parted undercut and 
American Eagle graphic tees. 
Vinny is back on top. He has a 
warm, honest persona that fake 
Cam simply can’t pull off, and 
he’s just offbeat enough to be 
cool. 
Vinny’s return to glory can 
be equated to the phoenix-like 
rise of another v-word (how 
convenient): vinyl. Since 2009, 
the vintage music format has 
experienced 
a 
260 
percent 
growth in sales. The scene 
inside any Urban Outfitters 
store has enough evidence of the 

phenomenon: walls lined with 
both modern and classic vinyl, 
from Led Zeppelin to Kendrick 
Lamar, with record players on 
sale to match. But what’s behind 
the 
spontaneous 
resurgence 
of vinyl in recent years? The 
answer to this question is a little 
more complex than the acne 
cream and good ol’ maturation 
of Vinny’s case.
To provide some insight, The 
Daily enlisted co-owner of Ann 
Arbor’s Encore Records, Jim 
Dwyer. According to Dwyer, 
the driving force behind vinyl’s 
rebirth is sound quality. When 
CDs were introduced, they were 
marketed as a cleaner-sounding 
alternative 
to 
vinyl 
that 
wasn’t prone to the warping 
or scratching which plagued 
records. As audiophiles began 
to have their way with the 
digital format, however, they 
noticed this marketed “clean” 
sound was cold and compressed 
in reality. Dwyer explained 
the vinyl sound is simply more 
palatable. 
“When you have a room with 
microphones and a band, the air 
is vibrating and it goes into the 
microphone. When the process 
is reversed, you put a needle on 
the record and the vibrations 
the 
microphone 
picked 
up 
are now coming out of your 
speaker,” he said. 
Conversely, with a CD, a 
recording is digitized into a 
string of zeros and ones that is 
etched into a disc as a series of 
bumps and non-bumps. A CD 
player shoots laser light at the 
disc to reveal these etchings and 
play their respective sounds. 
This electronic process results 
in a smooth and samely sound 
that lacks the warmth and 
authenticity of a mechanically 
engineered and played record, 
and people have begun to notice.
Dwyer also pointed toward 
the cyclical nature of culture, 
i.e., “everything old is new 
again,” 
to 
explain 
vinyl’s 
comeback. We all know this 
generational trend; vintage has 
an appeal — just ask any hipster. 
Today, it’s simply cool to have 
and play a record. What’s 
more, records aren’t “old” for 
millennials; vinyl is a novelty to 
young adults, as they grew up in 
a digital age dominated by CDs, 
iTunes and streaming services.
Additionally, vinyl provides 
a listening experience that has 
been lacking in the digital age. 
To start, a listener can actually 
see and interact with the cover 
art, an aspect of albums that has 
become virtually obsolete due 
to thumbnail images of album 
covers and technology’s size 
limitations. Playing records also 
ensures the listener experiences 
the tracks of an album in their 
intended sequence, as opposed 
to blasphemously shuffling or 
adding singles to a playlist.
As it pertains to Ann Arbor, 
Dwyer 
mentioned 
vinyl’s 
resurgence has not been as 
dramatic because records never 
really died out in the first place. 
A hip college town, Ann Arbor 
has always hosted students 
and 
non-students 
eager 
to 
experience the listening culture 
of yesteryear. With that said, 
there was a brief period in the 
’90s when Encore experienced 
dwindling demand for records 
and converted much of its 

inventory to CDs. The digital 
disease ran rampant, and even 
the mightiest of record stores 
stumbled. But thanks to vinyl’s 
renewed 
appeal, 
Encore 
is 
thriving once again.
“Customers come in from 
outside the area and say, ‘Oh 
boy, there’s nothing like this 
where we live,’ and they’re 
always shocked when I tell 
them that Ann Arbor actually 
has four record stores. So, we’re 

lucky,” Dwyer said. 
 Conveniently paired with 
vinyl’s revival is the influx of 
records into the vinyl vortex 
due to the inevitable aging of 
Baby Boomers, the original 
record collectors. Dwyer ended 
our conversation on this point, 
analogizing the vinyl experience 
to casual fishing, during which 
one catches a fish, basks in the 
triumph and returns the fish 
to the water to be caught by 
another 
triumphant 
person 
in the future. Like fishermen, 
he explained, vinyl collectors 
never really own their records; 
they borrow them, experience 
them and return them to the 
listening community, either at 
the end of the week or at the end 
of their lives.
“I’ve begun to realize that, at 
the end of the day, nobody gets 
to keep their records. You’re the 
caretaker of those records, and 
then when your turn to let it go 
comes, somebody else becomes 
the caretaker of that record,” he 
said. 
Fundamentally, 
it 
is 
this 
personalized, rich, cherishable 
experience that has brought 
listeners back to vinyl after far 
too many years of digitized, 
purified, 
impersonal 
sound 
— just like your revamped 
attraction to Vinny from math 
class.

Vinyl is back, but why?

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘‘TIL IT’S OVER’

 No one does summer 
romance better than Ander-
son .Paak. His expertly 
crafted mix of hip hop, funk 
and neo-soul sounds best 
when paired with a bottle 
of champagne sometime in 
mid-July; the multi-instru-
mental pop and fizzle of 
albums Malibu and Venice 
speak to long stretches of 
golden beaches and all the 
heated passion that comes 
with warm weather flings. 
It’s music that quite literal-
ly bursts with charisma — a 
breezy personability that is 
mirrored by .Paak himself, 
if his Tiny Desk perfor-
mance is anything to go by 
— and the reason why we 
all were eagerly anticipat-
ing the release of new music 
after 2016’s Yes Lawd!

 It’s 2018, a new single has 
finally been released and it 
does not disappoint. 
 Released as part of a 

Spike Jonze-directed Apple 
ad, “’Til It’s Over” takes 
all the sunny, shimmer-
ing vibrancy that .Paak 
is known for and adds a 
hypnotic twist. The song 
finds .Paak stretching to 
savor the last few moments 
of a relationship. The end 
is in sight, yet .Paak holds 
no regret, softly singing, 
“Only one more night in Los 

Angeles / I really thought 
I could handle it,” over an 
R&B groove that is remi-
niscent of older songs “The 
City” and “Room in Here.” 
The beat rises until .Paak 
utters the words, “Imma 
ride it ’til it’s over,” and 
then all noises cease. The 
only thing that is left to 
echo around in the cavity 
left behind is an ambient 
synth progression, growing 
and building on itself until 
the song seems to take a 
life of its own — organically 
shifting from one verse to 
the next. “’Til It’s Over” is a 
psychedelic daydream that 
you can’t help but be pulled 
into.

“Til It’s Over”

Anderson .Paak

Apple Music 

While shamelessly analyzing 
the outfit of someone across 
the room or on the streets, how 
is it that so much emphasis 
falls on the aspect of an outfit 
that is viewed last? Forget the 
shirt, jeans or jacket that blend 
with this accessory — or maybe 
they don’t even blend. Often 
times, outfits are centered 
around 
just 
one 
aspect: 
sneakers. Yes, that’s right: 
those Nikes, Adidas, Vans, 
Pumas, Reeboks, Converse or 
any other brand that you feel 
are almost a part of you. This is 
the aspect of fashion that more 
than anything seems to take 
the spotlight of streetstyle and 
beyond.
In fact, it is this idea that 
seems to drive the world 
that is sneaker culture. The 
integration 
of 
seemingly 
effortless athletic looks into 
everyday settings is one that 
truly is revolutionizing the 
fashion game. However, it is 
this emphasis on effortless, 
thrown together “athlesiure” 
that saturates the premise of 
sneaker culture with irony. In 
all honesty, keeping up with 
sneaker culture is really not 
effortless at all. It’s a ton of 
work.
Perhaps it’s the apparent 
brand orientation that innately 
comes with shoes or the way 
sneakers 
have 
transcended 
culture beyond just gym floors, 

but the focus on having the 
latest and greatest is at the base 
of sneaker culture. Historically 
used 
for 
more 
pragmatic 
purposes, 
sneakers 
started 
as just another shoe worn for 
athletics. Take Converse high 

tops, for example. The iconic 
red, white and blue, identifiable 
from anywhere, were once 
worn by basketball players in 
gyms across the United States. 
Stan Smiths too were inspired 
by the need for a pragmatic 
shoe on tennis courts. With an 
emphasis on simply fulfilling a 
task, sneakers have not always 
been the spectacle we view 
them as today.
As society has become a 
world of consumers, a world 
centered around media and 
material, sneakers made their 
way out of the gym, onto the 
streets and into the aesthetics 
of 
everyday 
life. 
With 
a 
twisted form of pragmatics in 
mind, sneaker culture serves 

as blatantly ignored source 
of 
complete 
consumerism. 
While it is often common that 
sneaker fans are loyal to one 
style or brand — those old Air 
Force 1s or checkerboard Vans 
— a huge pressure to have the 
latest version, the next best 
thing, is ever present. Even 
though each of us claim we 
have an old, beat up pair of 
sneakers we are loyal to, we 
still desire the next model, 
the next trend, whether it be 
within or beyond the designs 
of our favorite brands. These 
companies know sneaker fans 
will fall victim to this. How is 
it that one could feel the need 
to own Air Force 1s in high top 
and low top, or the same Pumas 
in a platform and regular sole? 
This is sneaker culture. It’s in 
the details. It’s in the constant 
changing of designs that we 
will never, no matter how hard 
we try, be able to keep up with.
So yes, stay loyal to those 
Adidas or Nikes that have 
quite literally been with you 
through it all. There’s just no 
denying that new styles and 
collaborations put out by these 
brands 
won’t 
be 
tempting 
or eat away at your inner 
“sneakerhead” as you convince 
yourself the latest Nikes are 
an absolute necessity to your 
shoe closet. Sneaker culture is 
built on this craving, this need 
for the new styles and new 
options. And scarily enough, 
without complaint, consumers 
do not appear to be running out 
of options anytime soon.

of today’s sneaker culture

disappeared,” and expresses his 
disbelief that anybody would ever 
expect him to stay there: “You 
ask why I don’t live here / Honey, 
how come you don’t move?” 
It’s descriptive, accusatory and 
deliciously spiteful. The song 
itself doesn’t actually even use the 
phrase “on the road again,” but it’s 
clear from the disdainful lyrics 
what the title phrase is referring 
to: The narrator is abandoning a 
lifestyle and a group of people he 
dislikes, back on the road to try to 
find something better.
Five 
years 
later, 
Canned 
Heat released their take on the 
phrase with a track of softcore, 
paranoid rock. The 1970 “On the 
Road Again,” which Slackwax 
covered in 2012, is full of bluesy 
repetitions: “But I ain’t going 
down that long, old lonesome road 
all by myself / But I ain’t going 
down that long, old lonesome 
road all by myself / I can’t carry 
you, baby, gonna carry somebody 
else.” Like Dylan’s version, it’s 

a song about getting away from 
one’s problems, mournful in the 
style of many blues songs but 
also tingling with a kind of dark 
optimism.
Ten years after that, Willie 
Nelson released perhaps the best-
known “On the Road Again,” 
a carousing country rock song 
full of all-too-classic road trip 
images, like “makin’ music with 
my friends” and “goin’ places 
that I’ve never been.” It’s free-
spirited, both in its lyrics and in 
its merry personality, and it’s one 
of those songs you can imagine a 
parent choosing as the first track 
on a mixtape just before setting 
out on some early childhood road 
trip. One of the intriguing things 
about it is the group aspect. When 
Nelson sings, “Our way is on the 
road again,” you feel like you’re 
included in the “our” — like you’re 
one of a group of people whose 
way is to keep going, always 
exploring, always seeking out 
someplace new and better.
The most recent major “On 
the Road Again” is from 2015: 
a weird, electronic psytrance 
instrumental from Israeli duo 
Infected Mushroom. However, 
I’m going to close out this article 
with a slightly older iteration: 
2005’s “On the Road Again” from 
hip-hop artist Sheek Louch. It’s a 
track full of blistering confidence, 
from boasts about the artist 
himself to comparisons between 
himself and other rappers (“I got 
a thousand songs like ’Pac and 
them”). Superficially, the sound 
itself is distinct from some of the 
other songs I’ve listed, in the way 
that they’re distinct from each 
other — for instance, you might 
not find Infected Mushroom and 
Bob Dylan on the same playlist, 
or the Memphis Jug Band and 
Canned Heat, unless it was a 
playlist (like the one I made the 
other day) entitled “Songs Called 
‘On The Road Again.’”
But when you get right down 
to it, Sheek’s version, just like 
Nelson’s and Dylan’s, is a song 
about personal progress, a song 
that says “full steam ahead.” 
He sings, “Anyway, back to the 
drawin’ board / I’m independent 
now, whoever with me, all 
aboard.” He visits and revisits 
a chorus that proclaims, “I’ve 

got my money, my passport, my 
gun is loaded,” and promises us, 
“A lot of shit about to change.” 
I’m willing to bet that if you’re 

handed the aux cord, whether 
you start blasting Sheek Louch or 
Willie Nelson, you’re doing it for 
similar reasons: You’re hitting the 
road, and you’re ready to feel good 
about it, and about yourself.
Music has always been one 
of the primary languages of 
transition, whether it’s between 
physical or geographical places 
(i.e. road tripping) or between 
one state of mind and another. 
And sure, maybe this is taking 
the whole “On the Road Again” 
thing a little too deep. After 
all, I don’t really think most of 
these artists were echoing one 
another on purpose. But in a way, 
that makes the common thread 
between them even stronger, 
because maybe we keep returning 
to roads and cars and trains for a 
reason. Maybe this is what music 
means to us, or at least a part of it. 
It’s about lamenting what you’ve 
lost — an unreliable lover, an 
unhealthy household, a company 
stolen away or gone sour — and 
then saying, “Well, back to it,” 
after everything. It’s about getting 
away from your problems while 
also heading toward something 
new, something for now only 
sensed — like following the length 
of a thread in a darkened room, 
or driving down a highway in no 
direction at all.

When I’m going on a road 
trip with friends, one of the first 
things we sort out after piling into 
the car is who’s going to get the 
first turn on the aux cord. I know 
this isn’t uncommon; the concept 
of being handed the aux cord has 
become so universal that it’s given 
way to a song called “Aux Cord,” 
several playlists with aux-related 
titles and, predictably, a score of 
relevant memes. This especially 
makes sense in the context of car 
trips, because music for a while 
now has been tied to notions of 
travel, adventure and freedom.
Could this be why there are so 
many well-known songs called 
“On the Road Again”?
It’s 
true. 
The 
adventure-
anxious “On the Road Again” 
track is a mysterious torch that has 
been handed down throughout 
history by such high-profile artists 

as Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan and 
the Memphis Jug Band. Upon 
first glance, these songs don’t 
seem entirely related, apart from 
the shared title. But it’s a telling 
title, and it reveals an important 
commonality that these artists 
share even across different genres 
— an appreciation for music as the 
spirit of the traveler.
In order to make sense of this, 
let’s go back to the beginning. 
The seminal “On the Road Again” 
was the version by the Memphis 
Jug Band, which was recorded 
in 1928. Characteristic of the 
Memphis Jug Band, the sound 
resembles acoustic blues mixed 
with early folk. Nas recorded a 
cover of the song last year as a part 
of the roots-focused “American 
Epic” TV series, as well as an 
interview in which he discussed 
the impact that songs like “On the 
Road Again” had on the influence 
of hip hop.
In both versions, the song 
relates the plight of a man whose 

lover keeps cheating on him with 
other men. There’s nothing fun 
about being cheated on in real 
life, but the song itself is non-
negotiable fun, largely due to its 
keeping focus on the carefree 
adventures 
of 
the 
cheating 
woman herself. The original 
recording comes across at times 
like a shouted exchange between 
the lead singer and the rest of 
the band, with the help of a 
characteristically wide variety of 
instruments and an unshakable 
melody. By the time the chorus 
hits with the lyrics, “She’s on the 
road again, just as sure as you’re 
born / Lord, a natural-born 
Eastman on the road again,” it’s 
practically impossible not to sing 
along.
The next notable “On the 
Road Again” came in 1965 from 
a different folk figurehead, Bob 
Dylan. The narrator sings about 
a home that he finds distasteful, 
with “fistfights in the kitchen” 
and “a hole where my stomach

REPRISE RECORDS
It was 1969 at a dairy farm 
in the Catskills of New York, 
the Aug. sun glaring heavily 
down on the backs of 400,000 
patrons. The small town of 
Bethel 
was 
overrun 
with 
young people; they were there 
for the Woodstock Music and 
Art Festival, whose organizers 
originally 
only 
expected 
50,000 to come. Instead, the 
three days of the festival 
marked a pivotal moment in 
American cultural history — 
Woodstock became a symbol of 
freedom which encompassed 
some 
of 
the 
most 
iconic 
moments 
in 
music 
during 
that 
time. 
Carlos 
Santana 
climbed the stage scaffolding, 
the Grateful Dead performed 
until they blew out their amps 
and legends like Janis Joplin 
and Jimi Hendrix inspired 
generations to come. Struck by 
the event, Joni Mitchell wrote 
her masterpiece “Woodstock,” 
which she shared with then-
boyfriend 
Graham 
Nash 
to perform at the festival. 
The song became a lasting 
image of those three days, 
but also an anthem of the 
phenomenon that is that era’s 
counterculture; a piece of the 

Aquarian age which serves as 
a window into the past.
The real power of the song 
comes with its timelessness — 

Mitchell’s core sentiment of 
“getting back to the garden” is 

a universal desire, especially 
for those who work towards 
change. Her lyrics go beyond 
the tune itself, functioning 
as a poetic reflection on the 
festival’s 
meaning 
within 
the late 1960s zeitgeist. To 
Mitchell, we are all “stardust,” 
“golden,” “billion year old 
carbon,” all the same in the 
dream to move forward in our 
lives and societies. Woodstock 
’69 was the tipping point 
for this movement in music 
culture, an event which united 
thousands of young people to 
collectively celebrate the art 
of their time. This unification 
was made even more poignant 
by the looming presence of 
Vietnam, as anti-war efforts 
reached a fever pitch within 
counterculture and the general 
population 
alike. 
Mitchell 
even weaves the war into 
“Woodstock,” seeing “bombers 
turning into butterflies” in the 
skies above her.
Though it seems like a blip 
in history from the present 
perspective, Woodstock was 
a phenomenon which meant 
more than just what occurred 
during those three days. It 
was an incredible collection 
of 
the 
era’s 
most 
famous 
and

Joni Mitchell, the summer 
of ’69 and the Woodstock
cultural phenomenon

MUSIC 

the rebirth of folk, the height 
of rock ‘n’ roll and the rise of 
funk. Even with this, the legacy 
of Woodstock ’69 goes beyond 
its iconic music, and instead 
lies within the intention of the 
thousands who attended. The 
festival was a unique moment 
to come together in a time of 
political and social turmoil, 
an opportunity to collectively 
shout 
against 
the 
powers 
which held back America’s 
inevitable evolution. It was an 
effort to rebuild the country’s 
soul, or at least mark a turning 
point clearly within cultural 
history 
— 
a 
chance 
for 
thousands of young people to 
be, as Mitchell sings, a “cog in 
something turning.”
In a time where music 
festivals saturate the popular 
sphere, 
it’s 
important 
to 
remember Woodstock as a 
benchmark for what they can 
truly offer to society. Though 
festivals like Coachella and 
Lollapalooza are slowly being 
lost to commercialism, there 
is still a nugget of cultural 
importance in the idea that 

they are built on. When that 
many young, interested and 
musically savvy people gather 
in one place, there is always 
the potential for social and 
artistic change. Woodstock 
’69 held incredible meaning 
during its time and still does 
today, reminding us of the 
power that unity in art and 
culture can have in periods of 
chaos. As Mitchell writes, our 
country is too often “caught 
in the devil’s bargain” of 
greed 
and 
disillusionment 
— 
it’s 
the 
responsibility 
of 
counterculture 
to 
reel 
against this bargain through 
a collision of innovative art 
and 
social 
awareness, 
no 
matter how hard it may seem. 
Woodstock’s status as one of, 
if not the most famous festival 
in American music history 
acts as evidence that unity 
and the celebration of art 
can truly shift the course of 
culture to pursue a different 
future — that festivals have 
the potential to help us find 
“the garden” of change we all 
seek.

On the road again and again, the music never ends

In Mar. of 2016, I finally 
had the opportunity to be in 
“the room where it happens” 
— or as most people say, to see 
“Hamilton” on Broadway. I had 
third row tickets since a year 

prior and had scored them for 
only 100 dollars apiece, having 
been an avid fan since before 
the show met smash success. 
I guess you can say I “knew it 
before it was cool,” making me, 
inherently, one of the show’s 
most devoted followers known 
as ‘Hamilfans.’
The show was, in short, 

everything 
and 
nothing 
I expected at once. It is 
breathtaking, 
life-changing, 
magic and certainly makes a 
major statement about race and 
diversity. It calls upon society 
as a whole to think deeper 
about what these things mean 
in the modern age.
There’s a certain buzz in

by women. “Twilight” is a 
women’s story, through and 
through, and we can’t talk about 
“Twilight” 
without 
talking 
about that first.
Let’s be clear: The fact that it’s 
a women’s story doesn’t make it 
a feminist story, but I think the 
process of either blacklisting 
media or giving it the feminist 
stamp of approval undercuts 
the 
fact 
that 
feminism 
is 
complicated and messy and it’s 
not an all-or-nothing, yes-or-
no statement of fact. Feminism 
is a movement, not a label, 
and we should treat it as such, 
otherwise everyone would be 
too scared of relinquishing our 
Good Feminist Credentials (not 
a thing) to admit that we enjoy 
really 
undeniably 
amazing 
things like the scene where 
the vampires play baseball as 
Muse’s 
“Supermassive 
Black 
Hole” plays.
I don’t particularly think 
it matters if “Twilight” is 
“feminist” 
or 
“empowering” 
or any other words that don’t 
actually represent one side of a 
good/bad binary, even though 
people on the internet sure do 
try to convince you that they do. 
What does matter is the fact that 
I saw the first “Twilight” movie 
in the most crowded theater in 
my life to date, and apart from 
a couple of disgruntled dads 
and boyfriends, it was filled 
entirely by women and young 
girls. The energy in the room 
was palpable — girls screaming 
at the first sight of R-Patz 
(God, that hair), and reciting 
their favorite lines from the 
book (“I was unconditionally, 

irrevocably in love with him”). 
Maybe it wasn’t necessarily 
“empowering” (whatever that 
means), but it was powerful, 
and I don’t mean emotionally 
powerful, I mean it represented 
a tangible cultural power. For 
a few years, one of the biggest 
blockbuster 
franchises 
that 
completely saturated the media 
and its surrounding discourse 
was a story about a teenage girl’s 
supernatural romance. That’s 
some honest-to-God real power: 
Young women, harnessing their 
collective cultural capital to 
dominate the zeitgeist in a way 
that I don’t think has been 
replicated in the years since.
Over the years, there’s been a 
lot of thoughtful criticism of the 
way “Twilight” makes abuse 
seem romantic, in the way it 
reinforces 
both 
backwards 
gender roles and the damaging 
effect a culture filled with this 
kind of media can have on young 
girls. But accompanying those 
careful, necessary responses 
was 
an 
undeniable 
vitriol 
towards “Twilight,” its author 
and its fanbase.
Any earnest criticism was 
immediately drowned out by 
the seemingly endless sea of 
trolls on the Internet flooding 
message boards and comment 
sections 
with 
long-winded 
screeds nitpicking stupid plot 
details, trashing the characters 
and sending Stephenie Meyer 
death threats. For a while, 
“Twilight” 
was 
treated 
like 
the 
end 
of 
literature, 
feminism, feminist literature 
and America’s conscience (or 
whatever other theories the 
people 
who 
are 
absolutely 
no fun at parties talk about). 
I’m not saying critiques of 
“Twilight” are sexist — those 
made in good faith are usually 
the opposite — and there’s 
obviously a distinction between 
the faceless horde of the internet 
and the thoughtful critics who 
honestly had something to say. 

But ultimately it didn’t matter 
the intentions, because the 
result was a massive dogpile 
effect, and the people who got 
hurt or targeted ended up being 
the young girls of “Twilight”’s 
audience, made to feel stupid 
and ashamed for indulging in a 
fun, romantic fantasy.
This is nothing new. There’s 
a long and storied tradition of 
talking down to teenage girls, 
assuming 
they’re 
mindless 
sycophants who can’t think 
for themselves and don’t know 
what’s good for them, all the 
while dismissing their interests 
as dumb and frivolous and 
not 
worth 
Important 
Male 
Validation. It’s a stupid and 
frankly insulting perspective to 
have towards art in general, but 
it’s especially egregious for a 
work like “Twilight.” Why does 
something made so specifically 
for female attention need to be 
validated as worthy of men’s 
attention too? “Twilight” isn’t 
for everybody, but that’s not a 
mistake — it’s by design. The 
mean-spirited 
backlash 
to 
“Twilight” was, I think, mostly 
informed by the fact that to 
experience 
“Twilight,” 
you 
have to engage with a women’s 
space, with a work that was 
created for the express purpose 
of 
indulging 
teenage 
girls’ 
fantasies and making them 
happy.
And you know what? It 
worked. There was joy in that 
movie theater in 2008, and I 
think that matters. The fact 
that “Twilight” tapped into 
the essence of the teenage 
experience in a way that felt 
true, and in a way that brought 
happiness to so many people 
matters, because even if the story 
is sparkly and silly, the resulting 
joy isn’t something to be taken 
lightly. “Twilight” is important 
because teenage girls loved it 
deeply, in the way only teenage 
girls can: unconditionally and 
irrevocably.

Ten years later, ‘Twilight’ 
is still really important

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW:
‘RIC FLAIR DRIP’

 Has anyone more genu-
inely enjoyed being in a 
music video more than Ric 
Flair in Offset and Metro 
Boomin’s new video for 
“Ric Flair Drip”? Released 
Mar. 1st, the video would 
be aggressively generic if it 
were not for the eponymous 
69-year-old lending a prom-
inent appearance, joining 
Offset, 21 Savage and Metro 
Boomin in their celebration 
of excess. The moment that 
the WWE legend hops out of 
the Rolls Royce with match-
ing electric blue loafers and 
pants, you can tell this will 

be no cursory cameo.
 His appearance is the 
focal point of the video, 
from his enthusiastic danc-
ing (or at least, as enthusi-

astic as could be expected 
from an AARP-eligible 
man who just got out of the 
hospital months ago) to 

the simply fantastic scene 
where he is presented with 
his choice of lavish cloth-
ing. It is no surprise that 
Ric Flair fits in well in this 
environment: A decent por-
tion of his public image is 
built around his rock ‘n’ roll 
lifestyle and the embrace of 
excess (both drugs and per-
sonality). This video is well 
worth watching just for his 
performance, and the song 
is also pretty good, for what 
it’s worth.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

the Richard Rogers theatre 
(and countless other theatres 
around 
the 
country, 
now 
that the show has begun its 
national tour) as the house 
lights dim. But the physical 
performance isn’t the most 

insane part of the experience. 
What’s crazier, for those brave 
enough to venture to the stage 
door, is the scene as the stars 
come out to meet and greet 
fans and audience members.
Picture news coverage on 
the morning of Black Friday — 
year after year, huge swarms 
of people high on caffeine 
and 
adrenaline 
charge 
a 
Super Walmart in suburban 
Pennsylvania to fight to the 
death over a $49.99 Xbox. Sub 
out the middle-aged mothers 
for theatre kids and the Xbox 
for a Lin-Manuel Miranda 
autograph, 
and 
you’ve 
got 
the Hamilton stage door. Of 
course, being the devoted fan 
I am, with stars in my eyes 
and dried tears on my cheeks 
(the last scene is an absolute 
heartbreak), I joined the other 
5,000 fans, both those who got 
to see the show on that Mar. 
evening and those coming out 
just hoping to catch a glimpse 
of their favorite star, at the 
stage door.
I 
wasn’t 
expecting 
the 
experience I had, and quite 
frankly, 
had 
never 
seen 
anything like it before. The 
entire block was barricaded, 
and the sidewalk begged for 
more space, pushing into the 
“Les Mis”’s theatre corner 
threateningly. 
Security 
guards stationed themselves 
around the gates and near the 
door — a no-mess bunch. The 
fans crowded, threw elbows, 
yelled and shrieked. It was 
like being brought back to the 
mosh pit at the emo concert I 
attended in ninth grade during 
my brief indie stage, except 
on the streets of New York 
City. The people around me 
grew restless and eventually 
rude, taking away from the 

camaraderie and experience 
of the after-show stage door, 
something 
so 
unique 
and 
special to the theatre. The 
crowd 
expected 
something 
from the cast and felt entitled 
to each member making an 
appearance, 
not 
thinking 
of the three-hour marathon 
they 
just 
sang, 
danced 
and 
emotionally 
invested 
themselves 
in 
(sometimes 
twice each day). Rather, just 
of the blurry picture and 
scribbled 
autograph 
that 
would eventually move from 
coffee table to a box under the 
bed.
In short, diehard “Hamilton” 
fans are a rare breed.
To me, there’s something 
really special about going to a 
stage door after a performance. 
There’s nothing like the “stage 
door” experience in any other 
form of art. After a concert, 
artists 
don’t 
usually 
stage 
door and you can’t meet the 
stars of your favorite movies 
and television shows upon 
completion of an episode or 
film. They stay on the other 
side of the screen, stage and 
radio. But in the theatre, 
especially in New York City, 
we are blessed with the gift 
of being able to meet the cast 
after they perform. Praising 
them, asking questions and 
enjoying a human moment 
from 
Broadway 
star 
to 
audience member — something 
Hamilton fans really seem to 
have redefined and taken for 
granted.
As a whole, the group was 
rambunxious and obnoxious, 
throwing 
themselves 
and 
their iPhones at the barricade 
and against other people — 
creating not a space to share in 
the revelry of live theatre, but 
rather a hostile scenario for 
everyone involved. Beckoning 
where 
certain 
actors 
and 
creative team members were, 
when perhaps, those people 
just wanted to head home and 
eat a bowl of cereal, make a pot 
of tea and go to sleep.
Of course, we are lucky 
that “Hamilton” has had the 
great effect and influence that 
it has, that it has touched so 
many people and had such 
a wonderful reaction to the 
public. Any piece of pop culture 
with such magnitude in the 
21st century will generate some 
form of a cult-like following or 
large grouping of crazy fans — 
but respecting the performers 
and creative team, in addition 
to the piece of theatre itself, 
should be all these fans’ first 
priority.
Unfortunately, this really 
doesn’t seem to be the case. 
Instead of remembering the 
base of their love and devotion 
to “Hamilton,” the fans I 
encountered at the stage door 
that 
night 
seemed 
rather 

selfish 
and 
disrespectful. 
I know I’m not the only 
one who thinks so, as Lin-
Manuel Miranda used to get 
strings of hate tweets and 
harsh Twitter attacks for not 
visiting the stage door after 
his performances. Eight shows 
a week is a feat, and Miranda, 
who also has a wife and child, 
sometimes just needed to head 
straight home to sleep. Instead 
of respecting that decision 
and realizing its implications, 
fans took to social media, 
criticizing and belittling him 
as a person.
Being a part of a theatre 
fandom so large and intense, it 
can be easy to forget why you 
began to follow the particular 
show. However, it’s important 
to remember that no matter 
how passionate you are about 

the musical, its performers and 
creators, they’re real people 
too with lives beyond the 
stage. Despite my adoration 
of the show and idolization 
of its writer and star Lin-
Manuel Miranda, I always 
want to respect and admire 
them first. The wild group of 
“Hamilton” fans I encountered 
that night and other groups 
of “Hamilfans” around the 
country need to remember why 
they love the show, and to act 
appropriately, 
remembering 
what the theatre is for and why 
we love it.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I 
distinctly 
remember 
the day Glossier seized me 
with their talons. I had been 
nonchalantly going through 
my popular page on Instagram, 
and one post caught my eye. 
It was a close-up of a woman 
smiling in front of a millennial 
pink 
background, 
but 
the 
photo was so much more than 
that. Her skin was flawless. 
Her hair, effortless and messy. 
Her eyes and lips completely 
free of makeup. And most 
importantly, the model was 
quite literally glowing. Her 
skin had a hue that was shiny 
but not in a sweaty way. In fact 
it was almost inhuman. To be 
frank, the photo was clearly 
unrealistic and no one would 
know it was selling a beauty 
product because the model 
was absolutely free of any 
trace of makeup. No, Glossier 
was 
selling 
an 
aesthetic. 
The 
brand 
had 
perfected 
minimalism and was roping 
innocent millennials into an 
endless cycle of unnecessary 
packaging, 
unrealistic 
expectations and unwarranted 
expenses.
Founded in 2014 by Emily 
Weiss, Glossier is a makeup 
and skincare company that 

prides itself in its thorough 
use of minimalism and overall 
aesthetic.
Now, before I get started 
on my takedown of Glossier, 
I do have a confession. My 
laptop is decked out in Glossier 
stickers at this moment, and 
I may or may not have taken 
my pencils out of one of their 
infamous pink pouches. I am 
one of the millions of people 
who has been seduced by this 

franchise, and I do not plan 
on curing my obsession any 
time soon. Does that make 
me biased in my criticism? 
Absolutely. Nevertheless, that 
doesn’t make my arguments 
any less valid.
Glossier can be classified 
as makeup for people that are 
already pretty. Their goal and 
slogan are admirable — “Skin 
first, makeup second” — in 
order to advocate for the use 
of 
“barely-there” 
makeup. 
Nevertheless, they are clever 
in their advertisements as 
their 
models 
already 
have 
flawless skin. Yes, Glossier, 
many people wish that they 
could feel absolutely stunning 
without the use of foundation 
or some eyeliner. However, 
it is not until they purchase 
Glossier’s perfecting skin tint 
(26 dollars) or the Wowder 
(setting powder priced at 22 
dollars) that they realize it 
provides little to no coverage. 
Glossier, 
nonetheless, 
has 
already 
won 
the 
battle. 
The 
consumer 
has 
lost 
approximately 40 dollars and 
CEO Emily Weiss, with her 
abnormally radiant skin and 
charming smile, is laughing at 
them behind the scenes. Even 
so, this is not the consumer’s 
last encounter with Glossier. 
Their stickers are addictive, 
the packaging is beautiful and 
they heard that Boy Brow is 
life-changing, so they must 
purchase that as well.
Be that as it may, Glossier 
does have some products that 
provide some coverage and 
serve the purpose of makeup. 
Many have fallen victim to their 
two products, Boy Brow and 
Cloud Paint, which admittedly 
are fairly effective. Boy Brow 
(16 dollars) is an eyebrow filler, 
while Cloud Paint (18 dollars) 
is a liquid blush. However, they 
are not groundbreaking in the 
slightest and absolutely not 
worthy of their high prices. 
These 
two 
items 
arguably 
provide the same quality of 
makeup 
as 
any 
drugstore 
product and yet buying both 
is a hit on one’s bank account. 
However, Glossier will attempt 
to cover their resemblance 
to drug-store products with 
their Body Hero campaign 
that displays them as more 
inclusive than the average 
drugstore 
brand. 
In 
this 
campaign for a moisturizer 
that comes in small packaging 
and is so utterly conventional, 
Glossier goes berserk with 
their 
advertisements 
that 
showcase 
women 
of 
all 
different body types and races. 
It is absolutely brilliant. In 
fact, Weiss almost tricked me 
into buying the moisturizer 
because I did appreciate the 
message they were putting out. 
I am nearly convinced she is an 
evil genius.
Though I do love the Glossier 
packaging, I must admit that 
it is a little much. In one of 
my purchases of highlighter, 
I received a poster, a pack of 
stickers, a piece of cardboard 

with a sample attached to it, 
a pink pouch, a box for the 
highlighter and, finally, the 
highlighter. This is something 
that most people probably 
would 
not 
argue 
against. 

The more goodies with every 
expensive purchase the better. 
Nonetheless, it marks Glossier 
as completely transparent in 
their marketing. At this point, 
the fact that they are selling 
an aesthetic is so blatant 
that it is almost laughable. 
Glossier knows that they pull 
off millennial pink better than 
anyone else, and they are going 
to take advantage of that until 
their final days.
While I continue to love 
Glossier and will forever be 
heavily reliant on Boy Brow, I 
must admit that the company 
is, simply put, bullshit. CVS has 
a few very worthy substitutes 
such 
as 
the 
Maybelline 
Brow Drama Sculpting Brow 
Mascara, 
the 
Cucumber 
Cooling Peel-Off Facial Mask, 
the Neutrogena Clear Pore 
Cleanser, and the Freeman 
Facial Charcoal & Black Sugar 
Polish Mask. At some point, 
millennials need to find the 
will to separate themselves 
from the adorable stickers we 
all know and love and make 
CVS our new Glossier, because 
frankly, the two are practically 
synonymous in quality.

Revisiting : ‘Sex and the 
City’ and its glory days

TV SERIES

“Sex and the City” is wild. 
Darren Star’s (“Younger”) HBO 
romantic dramedy that ran from 
1998-2004 was, and still is, a 
cultural phenomenon. It had 
a throng of devoted fans (my 
mother, a “Miranda,” included), 
all putting themselves in the heels 
of the show’s four leading ladies.
“Sex and the City” went 
through its prime when I was a 
baby, and I kept having to remind 
myself of this as I streamed it on 
Amazon. Its six seasons are filled 
with quips and one-liners that 
just aren’t OK anymore. Jokes 
like bisexuality being a “layover 
on the way to Gay Town” and the 
constant slut-shaming directed at 
Samantha don’t hold up, and they 
shouldn’t.
Still, when I sat down to 
inhale the series, I found myself 
thinking it was open-minded 
for its time. Our heroines are 
unapologetically themselves, and, 
despite the occasional cringe and 
frequent “yikes,” I loved every 
second of it. Miranda challenged 
me, Carrie excited me, Charlotte 
pushed me and Samantha kind 
of scared me. I rooted for each 
of them, through all of their 
self-induced 
difficulties 
and 
horrifying blunders.
I knew the show was equal 
parts progressive and problematic 
before I started watching, but I 
wanted to watch it nonetheless. 
I couldn’t help but wonder: What 
have I been missing?
“Ex and the City,” season 
two, episode 18
The end of this episode is 
perfect. It’s one of the most perfect 
endings in the whole series. Carrie 
(Sarah Jessica Parker, “Divorce”) 
gets an invite to Big’s (Chris Noth, 
“Gone”) engagement brunch, and 
watching her open that letter, 
curled up on her bed, I felt her 
change. I felt her fall deeper in 
love with a man who couldn’t give 
her what she wanted, and I felt 
her clinging to every last ounce 
of the faltering faith she had in 
him. She doesn’t say anything, but 
when the arch of her foot slowly 
slides the envelope off the edge of 
her duvet, she has a clearer head 
than she did five minutes ago. 
She’s free by default.
Cut to the last few minutes of 
the episode, when season two 
closes in the most K-K-K-Katie 
way. Our gals are out for drinks, 

and they’re angry at Big for 
hurting Carrie, hurting the rest 
of them in tandem. He’s marrying 
a simple girl with straight hair, 
and as the women gush over “The 
Way We Were,” the show makes 
it very, very evident that Carrie is 
not a simple girl. None of them are. 
They use their Manolo Blahnik’s 
to stomp out the “free by default” 
narrative to nothing but dust on a 
Manhattan sidewalk.
Carrie saunters her way to 
Big’s brunch, meeting him in 
front of the hotel to brush hair 
from his face and finally make 
him understand that he never 
understood. She reclaims herself, 
letting the wind run her curls wild 
and release her (for now, at least) 
from Big. It’s the most “Carrie” 
that Carrie has ever been.
“I Heart NY,” season four, 
episode 18
After shutting a small door 
on Big and opening a big one for 
Aidan (John Corbett, “Still the 
King”), season three takes us 
through the rise and fall of Carrie’s 
flared-jean, 
turquoise-ringed 
relationship 
with 
everyone’s 
favorite 
furniture 
craftsman. 
Season four is a recovery from 
this (a temporary one, of course, 
because does Carrie ever fully 
recover from anything?). Big 
announces he’s moving to the 
West Coast, and they dance in 
his packed-away living room to 
a “Moon River” record that’s 
just as broken and cyclic as their 
relationship. It’s sweet until it’s 
absolutely devastating, and the 
rest of the episode follows suit.
Charlotte (Kristin Davis, “Bad 
Teacher”) continues to find grace 
in the aftermath of a draining 
marriage, and Samantha (Kim 
Cattrall, “Modus”) realizes she 
surrendered her heart to the 
wrong man. Miranda (Cynthia 
Nixon, 
“That’s 
Harassment”) 
and Steve (David Eigenberg, 
“Chicago Fire”) have their baby 
boy. It’s a season finale that 
highlights the utter complexities 
of losing yourself to love and 
living through the loss, which, 
ultimately, is what I think the 
show itself aimed to do: To propel 
the independence and resilience 
of these four women, as they 
fearlessly gave themselves to 
whatever, or whoever, their lives 
had in store for them.
“The Ick Factor,” season six, 
episode 14
This is a very important 
episode, and not because Carrie 
doesn’t know how to cope with 

romance. Yeah, it’s her show, 
whatever, but this is the episode 
where Miranda and Steve get 
married! Did you hear me? Did 
I yell loud enough? I’ve always 
preferred Miranda’s wheelhouse 
of men to Carrie’s revolving door, 
and Steve is the beating heart 
of this (yes, even movie-Steve, 
but I don’t want to get into that 
right now). “The Ick Factor” is a 
minefield, and their wedding is a 
blissful release from it.
Charlotte is happy, and she’s 
happy with Harry, and I can’t 
tell you how happy that makes 
me. Her arc has been littered 
with pain, and she needs this. 
She deserves this. Carrie comes 
to terms with the fact that a 
fancy French man wants to woo 
her (because apparently, that’s 
the kind of thing Carrie needs to 
come to terms with). Life is good 
for our girls, and then Samantha 
finds out she has breast cancer.
She tells Carrie first and 
then Charlotte, trying to spare 
Miranda the news until her 
“special fucking day” is over. 
But they’re friends, sisters and 
soulmates, and Miranda knows 
that something is off. The last 
couple minutes of the episode are 
spent around a little square table 
at the back of Miranda’s wedding 
reception. The four women pool 
themselves together, filling a 
reservoir with strength to give 
to 
Samantha. 
This 
moment 
is everything, and it captures 
so elegantly what the women 
of “Sex and the City” were to 
one another. They were one, 
an irrevocable force of female 
friendship, a whirlwind of love.
The show isn’t perfect, and 
neither are its heroines. Carrie 
really sucks sometimes (a lot of 
the time), and I wish Charlotte 
was as woke as her internet 
alter-ego. But what “Sex and the 
City” does, and does well, is show 
women supporting each other — 
unconditionally, 
unabashedly 
and unrelentingly. After six 
messy seasons (and many now 
frighteningly outdated jokes), 
the 
show 
remains 
beloved 
because of its women and their 
ownership over their sexuality. 
They found voices in themselves 
and laughed over the noise of 
people acting like their bodies 
weren’t their own to control. It’s 
radical in its own, elaborate way, 
and it’s so much fun to watch. 
Run to it in your favo rite Jimmy 
Choo’s — but watch out for the 
puddles.
