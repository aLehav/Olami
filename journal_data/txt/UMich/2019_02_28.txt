Whitmer
criticizes 
new Title 
X changes

Federal family planning 
program no longer offers 
abortion counseling, referrals

On 
Friday, 
the 
Trump 

administration 
announced 

final changes to Title X 
family planning program, 
the federal grant program 
designed to provide com-
prehensive 
family 
plan-

ning services to low-income 
Americans. The new rule 
will prohibit health care 
providers who receive Title 
X 
funding 
from 
offering 

patients abortion counseling 
or referrals.

The Trump administra-

tion first proposed changes 
to Title X last year, and the 
revisions 
were 
met 
with 

strong support from conser-
vatives. The changes will 
go into effect 60 days after 
being formally published to 
the Federal Register. 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 

issued a statement shortly 
after the proposed changes 
to Title X were announced. 
Whitmer 
criticized 
the 

Trump administration for 
limiting access to a variety 
of a family planning servic-
es.

Daily Staff Reporter 

In 
the 
packed 
Hill 

Auditorium of about 3,500 
students, staff and local 
Ann Arbor residents, Yo-Yo 
Ma walked out dressed in a 
black suit matched with a 
light pink tie. He looked to 
the crowd, glasses perched 
on the tip of his nose, 
standing adjacent to a $2.5 
million dollar cello named 
“Petunia.” At least he didn’t 
leave it in a taxi this time, he 
joked.

The 
world 
renowned 

cellist was not in Ann Arbor 
to play a Bach concert suit 
or to perform with the 
Silk Road Ensemble — he 
came to talk about culture, 
understanding and survival.

Starting in August 2018, 

Ma began his two-year tour 
of the Bach Project. Ma 
will travel across the globe 
to iconic venues like The 
Red 
Rock 
Amphitheatre 

in 
Colorado, 
Washington 

National 
Cathedral 
in 

Washington, D.C. and to 
Ann Arbor’s very own Hill 
Auditorium. 
Ma’s 
project 

stresses in a world which 
is constantly changing and 
threatened by division, it is 
the role of culture and the 
arts to shape a better future.

The Bach Project does 

not just celebrate art in 
its musical form. It also 
attempts to analyze and 
rejoice 
in 
the 
diverse 

ways that art makes each 
community, 
each 
society 

and 
the 
unified 
planet 

stronger.

Born in Paris, Ma began 

playing cello at age four. 
By age seven, he had played 
for both presidents Dwight 
D. Eisenhower and John F. 
Kennedy. After graduating 
high school at age fifteen, 
he studied with Leonard 
Rose at Julliard, and then 
obtained an anthropology 
degree 
at 
Harvard 

University.

Sustainable Cultural Indicators 
Program releases year five report

CAMPUS LIFE 

Renowned cellist visits campus

Study findings indicate increased concern for environmental issues in campus community

SAYALI AMIN
Daily News Editor

The Sustainability Cultural Indi-

cators Program recently released its 
five-year report, which tracks the cul-
ture surrounding sustainability at the 
University of Michigan and how it has 
changed over the course of the program. 
The findings from SCIP serve to guide 
operations on campus and address 
environmental issues within the com-
munity.

SCIP began in 2012 and has been 

conducting surveys every year and a 
half, with the most recent data gathered 
from winter 2018. The surveys focus on 
three target populations, which encom-
pass students, faculty and staff. Some of 
the key findings of the five-year report 

include participants are more likely to 
believe in climate change, waste preven-
tion practices of undergraduates have 
improved and automobiles as a mode of 
transportation to work has increased for 
staff.

Robert Marans, research professor 

at the Institute for Social Research and 
a professor emeritus of architecture and 
urban planning, and John Callewaert, 
integrated assessment center director 
of the Graham Institute, are the two co-
principal investigators for the program. 
Marans brought survey expertise to 
SCIP
, while Callewaert was knowledge-

able of sustainability goals.

“Bob (Marans) and I got involved 

together,” Callewaert said. “I was 
bringing the specific knowledge of 
sustainability goals’ areas along with 

Bob’s knowledge of survey research, 
so it was a good partnership.”

Marans said the goal of SCIP is to 

measure how the University’s cul-
ture aligns in certain areas related to 
the environment and sustainability.

“SCIP is really an attempt to eval-

uate and see how we’re doing in all 
these areas,” Marans said. “They’re 
all related to the big goals set up by 
the University in terms of climate 
action and waste reduction and 
healthy environments and commu-
nity awareness.”

Callewaert added that SCIP has 

also led pilot programs, such as a 
composting initiative in Bursley, to 
test whether a certain project could 
be applied to the larger campus com-
munity as a whole.

“The value of what SCIP can do 

is we are asking people what they 
know about composting and if they 
are doing it, just kind of baseline 
data,” Callewaert said. “Then you 
can go into a place like Bursley — 
there’s enough students in Bursley 
that we can pull out their responses 
and see if it makes any difference 
and to kind of evaluate the pilot test 
before saying we want to do this in 
every residence hall.”

The biggest finding from the 

recent report, according to Marans, 
is the increased likelihood that a par-
ticipant believes in climate change 
and the increased concern for the 
environment.

The University of Michigan 

denied allegations it mishandled 
sexual assault claims against 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance professor David Daniels 
in court documents filed Friday. 
An attorney for the University 
said Andrew Lipian, a Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
graduate 

student who alleges Daniels 
sexually assaulted him, declined 
to participate in investigations 
conducted by the Office for 
Institutional Equity and the 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security.

Lipian filed a lawsuit in 

October accusing Daniels of 
drugging and sexually assaulting 
him on March 24, 2017. He also 
alleged the University failed to 
investigate Daniels after being 
made 
aware 
of 
complaints 

against the professor, claiming 
“OIE did nothing” and “No file 
was opened.”

Tickets to hear conservative 

political commentator Ben Sha-
piro sold out in under two min-
utes, according to Kate Westa, 
vice president of the University 
of Michigan’s chapter of Young 
Americans for Freedom.

Shapiro is the Editor in Chief 

of the conservative news and 
opinion website The Daily Wire 
and hosts his own conservative 
podcast, The Ben Shapiro Show. 
YAF, a student organization 
advocating conservative princi-
ples, will be hosting Shapiro on 
March 12 in Rackham Auditori-
um. Previous speakers hosted by 
YAF this year were conservative 
commentators Steven Crowder 

and Michael Knowles.

According to Westa, 617 of 

1060 tickets sold were registered 
under University student emails. 
Tickets reserved for University 
students sold out in less than 
two minutes and tickets for the 
public sold out in less than 60 
seconds with more than 4,200 
people on the waitlist, Westa 
said in an email statement.

Westa attributed the high 

demand for student tickets to 
what she believes is a desire 
among the student body for 
more conservative speakers.

“Clearly, 
these 
conserva-

tive voices are in high demand 
on campus,” Westa said in the 
email. “I think because so few 
conservatives are brought to 
speak on campus, students are 

taking full advantage of these 
opportunities and are really 
craving intellectual diversity.”

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen wrote in an 
email statement 13 percent of 
first-year students self-reported 
as conservative and far right in 
a voluntary survey over sum-
mer orientation. In the 2018 
orientation, 4,833 student took 
the survey, 32 percent reported 
they identified as “middle of the 
road,” 43 percent were “liberal” 
and 13 percent did not select an 
option.

LSA sophomore Taylor Smith 

said she got tickets to hear Sha-
piro in order to expose herself to 
more alternative political views.

“I think he’s a very interesting 

speaker,” Smith said. “I definite-

ly don’t agree with everything 
he says, but I still think it’s a 
great opportunity to go and hear 
different viewpoints than my 
own.”

Smith said she identifies as 

a moderate and wants to take 
advantage of an opportunity to 
hear from a conservative speak-
er.

“I definitely identify as a 

moderate,” Smith said. “It can 
go either way depending on the 
issue. I grew up being surround-
ed by tons of different opinions 
across the political spectrum. So 
it’s definitely given me apprecia-
tion for all views. And that’s why 
I want to go to this. I’ve never 
really 
heard 
a 
conservative 

speaker come and talk.”

Wednesday 
evening, 
LSA’s 

Barger Leadership Institute host-
ed the first of their speaker series 
at Weiser Hall. This event fea-
tured Paul Saginaw, the co-found-
er of Zingerman’s Community 
of Businesses, as well as Eileen 
Spring, the president and CEO of 
Food Gatherers, Michigan’s first 
food rescue program.

Mary Schlitt, assistant director 

for the Barger Leadership Insti-
tute, described the purpose and 
main goals of the first event in the 

Barger Institute’s new speaker se-
ries.

“The speaker series is an op-

portunity for us to bring in lead-
ers from all different contexts and 
all different arenas and sectors 
to kind of share their leadership 
practices and habits with our stu-
dents,” Schlitt said.

The event targeted undergrad-

uate students in hopes to show 
that not everyone’s career paths 
and journeys to leadership are 
straightforward.

“(The main goal is) to expose 

undergraduate students to indi-
viduals whose leadership jour-

neys are not linear, but they’re 
full and they also encompass a lot 
of different experiences and life 
experiences,” Schlitt said. “And 
how especially with these two 
leaders, how they work through 
connections and connecting to 
clients, and community mem-
bers and the government and all 
these different stakeholders to 
make decisions and to advance 
the agendas and visions of their 
organizations.”

Ramaswami Mahalingam, di-

rector of the Barger Leadership 
Institute and a professor of psy-
chology at the University, high-

lighted the uniqueness of the 
organization.

“The unique aspect of BLI 

is we want leadership develop-
ment that’s based on liberal arts 
education, and so the emphasis 
is on community based learn-
ing,” Mahalingam said.

Mahalingham explained the 

institute’s emphasis on value-
guided leadership.

“I think one of the challenges 

for any leader is how to con-
nect their leadership style to the 
values they have,” Mahalingam 
said. “I mean these two people 
are examples of how their values 
are guiding the kind of leader-
ship model they evolve.”

The event started off with a 

conversation facilitated by Ma-
halingam between both speak-
ers. The conversation com-
menced with a question about 
how the individuals’ values had 
shaped their leadership journey.

Spring discussed the most 

important values that guide her 
life, highlighting the important 
role trust plays in the way she 
interacts with her employees 
and volunteers, and how it af-
fects the overall structure of her 
organization.

“Trust is the biggest asset that 

a community organization has, 

and that’s probably true of any 
organization, but, you know, you 
have to earn it every day but it’s 
very fragile, it can be lost in like 
a moment,” Spring said. “And so 
to have your decisions based in 
that, and to have that bank, if you 
will, of trust, then your integrity 
can really guide you through re-
ally complex difficult situations 
where you don’t really know the 
answer.”

Saginaw recounted his early 

challenges and his experience 
building Zingerman’s into what it 
is today.

“In my experience, anything 

worth doing, anything of signifi-
cance, somewhere along the time-
line from where you’ve hatched 
this idea, and where you can 
measure it by all metrics you’ve 
been successful you’re popping 
the champagne, somewhere along 
here it’s going to look like a total 
failure,” Saginaw said. “And that’s 
when you really have to stay with 
it and keep going, it’s still a great 
idea so let’s just keep going.”

Saginaw discussed his views 

on leadership and his wish to give 
all of his employees the tools they 
need to succeed. He has worked 
hard to create a system that al-
lows for improvement and ad-
vancement. 

“We practice what’s called ‘ser-

vant leadership’... that’s focusing 
on the growth and development 
of the people that work for us,” 
Saginaw said. “We believe that ev-
erybody who comes in has some 
of the ingredients necessary to 
be successful and it’s our job is to 
help them identify what their mo-
tives are and to encourage them 
to take action on those. And if 
we’re focusing on that, we’re go-
ing to be in good shape.”

SCIP
From Page 1

CLIM ATE CHANGE OUTRE ACH

KARTIKEYA SUNDARAM/Daily

BLUElab President Natalie Brown discusses the scientific community’s take on climate change at the Climate Change 
Outreach Panel at the Shapiro Undergraduate Library Wednesday evening.

“One of the early findings 

was there was a big jump in the 
number of students and facul-
ty and staff between 2015 and 
2018 and those that believed 
in climate change believed it 
was impacted by human activ-
ity and thought that it was 
impacting them personally,” 
Marans said. “There’s a much 
greater concern and aware-
ness about issues related to 
climate change, that’s one big 
takeaway.”

In addition, the SCIP data 

has been used by other stu-
dents and faculty in their own 
research. Callewaert said he’s 
pleased with the number of 
ways in which the community 
has interacted with the data.

“I’m excited that overtime 

we’re seeing more and more 
people use the results,” Calle-
waert said. “Students that are 
using it for their research, for 
their honors theses, for their 
dissertations — really excited 
about that. We really have it 
set it up from the beginning 
so it’s something people can 
use.”

LSA senior Greg Cogut has 

been working with SCIP data 
since his sophomore year as 
an Undergraduate Research 
Opportunity 
Program 
stu-

dent. Cogut’s focus is on the 
areas of waste prevention and 
travel 
transportation, 
add-

ing that he’s interested in the 
human behavior aspect of sus-
tainability.

“My 
(UROP) 
topic 
was 

studying human behavior in 
environmental 
sustainabil-

ity,” Cogut said. “It was really 
in conjunction with the notion 
of what SCIP is looking for, 
identifying trends at the Uni-
versity realm. We sort of view 
the University as a living labo-
ratory.”

Cogut recently submitted 

some of his findings for pub-
lication, explaining the track-
ing of change over time is a 
unique aspect of SCIP data.

“The other academic jour-

nals … there weren’t many 
studies that were very long-
term or that large,” Cogut 
said. “When you’re dealing 
with changing human behav-
ior, you really want to have a 
long study and a large sample 
population. I tested my own 
theories about human behav-
ior 
in 
environmental 
sus-

tainability informed by my 
research and I was able to use 
the SCIP data.”

Marans 
mentioned 
this 

notion of tracking culture and 
human behavior in the field of 
environmental sustainability 
has gained international as 
well as national interest.

“There’s growing interest 

not only in other universi-
ties in the United States, but 
around the world in doing 
what the University of Mich-
igan is doing with respect 
to measuring and tracking 
culture 
of 
sustainability,” 

Marans said. “I’ve got a call 
scheduled next week with a 
woman in Taiwan. They want 
to do something similar, they 
requested some of our data, 
there are other universities 
around the world that are 
interested in doing something 

like our SCIP program.”

Callewaert 
added 
that 

not all findings of the five-
year report indicate positive 
changes. He cited increased 
commute times for staff as a 

growing trend over the course 
of the program.

“Some of the more challeng-

ing pieces (are) that staff are 
reporting longer commutes 
each time,” Callewaert said. 
“Fewer staff are living in Ann 
Arbor because of the housing 
prices, pushing a lot of staff to 
live further and further out. 
Their commute times have 
gone up almost every time, 
more time on the road, more 
time in the car. Specifically in 
terms of climate action that’s 
a challenge. You have to let 
people live where they want to 
live, but it’s so consistent each 
year staff commute gets fur-
ther — not so much for faculty 
because, you know, higher 
salaries.”

As for the future directions 

of SCIP, a proposal has been 
put in to receive additional 
funding to continue tracking 
trends on campus. Marans 
said they are hopeful for more 
time.

“The Graham Institute has 

put in a big proposal to the 
Provost’s Office to support 
and continue to support not 
just the SCIP program but all 
these other things related to 
culture,” Marans said. “We’re 
waiting to see and the propos-
al was to extend the funding 
for this work for almost three 
more years, and we’re fairly 
optimistic.”

Smith explained the demand to 

hear Shapiro could be connected 
to his strong media presence and 
effective marketing of the event by 
YAF.

“I think because he’s a well 

known speaker, he captures the 
media attention from both sides of 
the political aisle, a lot,” Smith said. 
“It’s also not someone you see a lot 
at Michigan. I know YAF is bring-
ing him and they did a lot a lot of 
marketing prior to this through 
Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. 
That’s how I originally heard about 
it. So I think that definitely had a 
large impact (on ticket sales) and 
YAF chapter in general was also 
marketing.”

LSA freshman Chiren Moore, 

who identifies politically as moder-
ate leaning towards conservative, 
said students could be eager to hear 
Shapiro because of an entertain-
ment value he brings to his talks. 
Moore mentioned Shapiro is known 
for quick remarks in question and 
answer portions of speeches, which 
have thousands of views on his You-
Tube channel with almost 600,000 
subscribers.

“I think he’s a pretty controver-

sial figure in that people post videos 
of him online and just the way he 
speaks, he has very quick come-
backs and stuff like that,” Moore 
said. “So I think a lot of people want 
to go see that because he’s enter-
taining … I think there are a lot of 
people that agree with him more 
than people expect … But I think 
a lot of people are going just to see 
what happens.”

Moore thinks tickets sold out 

quickly for Shapiro because they 
were free.

“They (the tickets) were free,” 

Moore said. “So I think that’s a big 
reason why a lot of people got them 
— cause you don’t have to pay for 
them. And I wanted to go because 
I’ve been listening to him for a 
while.”

Moore said Shapiro’s appearance 

on campus offers curious college 
students an opportunity to hear a 
conservative speaker in attempts to 
shape their own political views.

“I think the reason a lot of people 

wanted to go, especially college stu-
dents, is because in college you’re 
exposed to so many new ideas and 
it’s a really formative time,” Moore 
said. “Because of a lot of these stu-
dents are just now getting to vote 
… and they’re forming their own 
political ideas.”

Not everyone is as excited about 

Shapiro’s visit, though. On Feb. 22, 
 

Ann Arbor residents and University 
students gathered to discuss mea-
sures against Shapiro’s impending 

visit and prepare the logistics for a 
protest against the event.

LSA freshman Sophie Kehrig 

also expressed concern regard-
ing the visit. They said they worry 
bringing Ben Shapiro to campus 
will spread harmful sentiments 
among college students. They 
referred to Shapiro’s past state-
ments that minority groups are not 
“victims in American society” and 
said people who identify as trans-
gender have “a mental condition in 
which one believes he or she is of 
the opposite sex.”

“I think he would be harmful 

because he does this thing where 
he tries to play like he’s respectable 
or logical and then will undermine 
any and all other identities differ-
ent from his,” Kehrig said. “And his 
whole trying to take down this idea 
of identity politics and his idea that 
there’s a hierarchy of victimhood 
and that being a really negative 
thing… taking down other people’s 
experiences and identities, for what 
reason I’m never exactly sure, I 
think is really devise and unpro-
ductive. And if you’re saying you 
want everybody to be heard, this is 
a man that speaks to the fact that he 
doesn’t believe everyone’s voice and 
or narrative deserves to be taken 
seriously.”

Kehrig said they recognize the 

need to engage in a multitude of 
conversations with people who hold 
varying opinions, but believes Shap-
iro’s talk on campus would more of 
a negative than positive impact.

“I understand the necessity of 

needing a multitude of opinions and 
identities and why that’s important 
even if you don’t agree with it,” Keh-
rig said. “Not much can get done in 
an echochamber and I’m cognizant 
of that. But at the same time there 
comes a certain point where there 
is more harm done than good. And 
I feel like when the harm outweighs 
the good in a situation like this I 
think it’s time to reevaluate.”

The University’s chapter of Col-

lege Democrats declined to com-
ment on the event. The University’s 
chapter of College Republicans did 
not respond in time for publication.

Westa said in an email statement 

YAF strives to educate University 
students on conservative values, 
and hosting Shapiro will offer stu-
dents a new political perspective.

“Young Americans for Freedom 

(YAF) believes in individual free-
dom, limited government, free mar-
kets, and traditional values,” Westa 
said in the email. “Our goal on 
campus is to educate students on 
conservative values they other-
wise wouldn’t be exposed to at 
school. I can’t think of a better 
way of doing this than to bring 
the top conservative speaker 
of our day to the University of 
Michigan.”

“Title 
X 
ensures 
that 

every person has access to 
birth control, STI testing, 
cancer screenings, and other 
essential health care servic-
es — no matter where they 
live and how much money 
they have,” Whitmer wrote. 
“The 
Trump 
administra-

tion’s 
actions 
undermine 

this bipartisan supported 
federal-state 
partnership 

that has improved the health 
of women and families for 
decades.”

Whitmer 
asserted 
the 

new changes would reduce 
the 
amount 
of 
federally 

funded clinics, forcing indi-
viduals to travel further for 
these health services or go 
without. She asserted her 
commitment to protecting 
health care services and 
said she will work to prevent 
the proposed changes.

“It interferes in the doc-

tor-patient 
relationship,” 

Whitmer wrote. “When peo-
ple can’t see their provider 
of choice, they delay or sim-
ply go without care. Along 
with other newly elected 
governors, I will explore 
all options to block these 
changes. I remain commit-
ted to the women and men of 
Michigan who rely on Title 
X for access to basic health 
care services.”

Dylan Berger, president 

of the University’s chapter 
of College Republicans and 
LSA sophomore, said in an 
email interview that while 
the members of their orga-
nization have a “wealth of 

opinions” about abortion, 
they hope that Republicans 
and Democrats in Washing-
ton can find middle ground 
in regard to changes pro-
posed for Title X.

“We hope Washington is 

able to come together and 
reject extremism on both 
sides of this issue,” Berger 
wrote. “It’s key to both pro-
tect the sacred value of life 
and guarantee the personal 
liberty of all our citizens.”

Katie Kelly, communica-

tions director for the Uni-
versity’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said in an email 
interview it was dishearten-
ing to see the changes the 
Trump administration has 
made to Title X. In most 
cases, abortion services are 
already excluded from fed-
eral funding prior to the 
proposed changes.

Kelly sees the new rule 

as limiting access to health-
care for millions of indi-
viduals who rely on more 
affordable clinics for a vari-
ety of reasons.

“This is a blatant attack 

against women and all indi-
viduals who take advan-
tage of the services offered 
by clinics such as Planned 
Parenthood,” Kelly wrote. 
“It has been very clear for 
a long time that money 
from Title X cannot be 
used for abortion services, 
so this proposal will hurt 
the health of those who use 
these clinics for procedures 
such as cancer screening, 
general checkups, or family 
planning.”

Opponents of the changes 

to Title X are calling the 
revisions a “gag rule,” which 

will prevent providers from 
discussing abortion options 
with women or risk losing 
their federal funding. Kelly 
said the changes to Title X 
demonstrate 
a 
continued 

attack against women by the 
Trump administration.

“By making family plan-

ning services like Planned 
Parenthood choose between 
Title X funding and pro-
viding 
comprehensive 

family 
planning 
services, 

President Trump has essen-
tially implemented a domes-
tic gag rule,” Kelly wrote. “It 
is unconscionable that our 
President is attacking, yet 
again, the health and bodily 
autonomy of women. These 
changes 
will 
hinder 
the 

ability of many low income 
individuals from receiving 
quality medical care.”

Public Health junior Tri-

sha Gupte criticized the 
changes to Title X and said 
the new rules severely limit 
women’s choices for their 
health. According to Gupte, 
by 
preventing 
providers 

from even discussing the full 
range of healthcare options, 
the Trump administration 
is effectively denying indi-
viduals the right to make 
choices for themselves.

“You 
should 
have 
the 

option to have access to 
these kinds of services,” 
Gupte said. “It’s important 
to have choices. It’s impor-
tant that everyone has the 
opportunity to make choices 
that they want to, especially 
when it comes to reproduc-
tive justice.”

WHITMER
From Page 1

He 
has 
toured 
as 
a 

soloist with a multitude of 
distinguished 
orchestras, 

holds eighteen Grammys, won 
a Medal of Freedom, made a 
small appearances on “The 
Simpsons,” “The West Wing,” 
and performed on an NPR 
Music Tiny Desk Concert. Ma 
is now touring the world in hopes 
of promoting a seemingly ancient 
message from Johann Sebastian 
Bach. 

After playing a snippet from 

Bwach on the piano, Ma told the 
crowd that the selection was just 
one of 25 different variations of the 
same piece. 

“All music is based on variation,” 

Ma said. “In fact, I would go as far 
as to say that all life is based on 
variation. There is infinite variation 
that exists in nature, and in human 
nature. Today, we are acutely aware 
that there is nothing more constant 
than change. Constant, continual, 
unrelenting change. But, every 
change has a starting point and 
ending point. Just like a spiral, we 
keep surrounding the same evolving 
things.”

These variations resonated with 

LSA sophomore Colleen Jones. 
She told The Daily after the event 
that she thought it was interesting 
that someone like Ma could be so 
consciousness of these ideas.

“It is interesting he thinks about 

and understand the mutability and 
the ever-changing nature of life in 
general,” Jones said. “Mutability 
is like the one constant in our lives 
— we all have these variations. For 
Yo-Yo it wasn’t just being an artist it 
was also his social impact.”

There 
are 
three 
specific 

variations and changes Ma said 

impacted his life and have defined 
his world view and thinking. He 
noted although these variations 
might not appear in a standard 
biography, they are essential to how 
he practices being a cultural citizen 
and musician.

For the first variation, he took the 

audience back to the beginnings of 
his life and career and mentioned 
the constant stress from his two 
musician “tiger parents,” and the 
importance of practicing, or what he 
calls “the first principal of music.” 

“Scales, arpeggios: that was my 

daily diet,” Ma said. “But, I want to 
talk about a different kind of practice 
— the practice of experimentation 
and experience. This is the practice 
that helped me move from being 
a cellist to a musician, to thinking 
about being a cultural citizen. It is 
through the practice of experience 
and experiment that we invented 
culture, and it is through the 
continual practice of experience and 
experiments that culture evolves. 
Life, I’ve found is full of infinite 
variety.”

He said he found this variety 

in college. One day, he went to the 
doctor after being questioned about 
his limp by his future wife and was 
diagnosed with scoliosis. He had 
two options: either get a difficult 
surgery right then or wait until age 
23. Once he was engaged, ready 
to start a family at 23, he thought 
surgery would be the right choice.

“Inevitably, I play like it’s the last 

time I will ever play a piece,” Ma 
said. “The fact, that I confronted 
that as a possibility in the 
beginning of my performing life. 
That I could access that feeling at 
any given moment; that is success. 
I even grew two inches. Through 
the surgery, I was given a gift, of 
liberation. Every day after that I 
was given a gift.”

Ma then transitioned to his 

second variation. While studying 
at Harvard, Ma was exposed to 
French culture, Russian studies and 
the German language. However, 
Ma 
loved 
anthropology 
and 

archeology the most. He became 
fascinated 
with 
the 
Kalahari 

Bushmen tribe and their distinct 
music, which is found in one of the 
oldest human rituals today. While 
traveling to Botswana, he had the 
honor to meet the !Kung tribe of the 
Kalahari Bushmen, participating in 
these ceremonies.

“I interviewed this one woman 

and asked, ‘why do you do this?’” 
Ma said. “She looked at me and 
replied; 
‘because 
it 
gives 
us 

meaning.’ That is exactly what 
culture is for: it gives us meaning. 
How powerful, how simple, how 
true: it gives us all meaning.”

Ma sais his last variation 

happened only eight days ago. He 
and his wife had just returned 
from the Galapagos Islands. He 
talks about the bird, lizards and sea 
lions all living peacefully, evolving 
over time. He recalled the case of 
finches, who underwent changes in 
a short period of time. 

“We do not see evolution as 

theory, but as a direct result, as 
experiences and experiments, not 
unlike culture,” Ma said. “In this 
case, natures’ experiences and 
experiments. Therefore, human 
activity becomes a dominant force 
on our planet.The result of our 
experiences, and our experiments, 
will be measurable hundreds of 
years from now.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Elizabeth 

Haley told The Daily she found 
the idea of current choices having 
a visible effect to be exceptionally 
striking.

Three years ago, at the 

beginning of the fall 2016 
semester, student members 
of Black Lives Matter and 
the 
Black 
Student 
Union 

protested through walkouts, 
Diag chalk and marches in 
response to racist posters 
found 
on 
campus. 
That 

October, 
the 
University 

officially launched the five-
year DEI plan. Since then, the 
University 
administration 

says it has implemented 92 
percent of the initiative’s 
action items. From March 
to May of this year, the 
University plans to conduct 
a midterm assessment of the 
plan’s efficacy, culminating 
in a report of findings that 
will presumably be published 
this May. It is a fitting time to 
reflect on the functionality of 
this initiative and its effects, 
or lack thereof, on increasing 
diversity 
and 
helping 

marginalized groups feel safe 
on campus.

As 
an 
educational 

institution, 
the 
University 

has a responsibility to uphold 
values 
of 
inclusion 
and 

respect. The DEI plan has 
attempted to achieve this by 
holding campus-wide climate 
surveys, forming task forces 
such 
as 
REACT, 
creating 

spaces 
like 
the 
Trotter 

Multicultural 
Center 
and 

connecting 
with 
networks 

like 
Diversity 
Scholars, 

to name a few. That being 
said, the October 2018 DEI 
Progress 
Report 
revealed 

that so far, the quantitative 
effects of improving student 
and faculty diversity have 
been 
somewhat 
minimal. 

Action items and numbers 
vary from school to school, 
and it may be too early to see 
long-term results, but the lack 

of change means the program 
has 
not 
yet 
completed 

its goals. Therefore, it is 
crucial that the University 
continues 
to 
work 
with 

students on improving and 
implementing the DEI plan. 
We acknowledge the work 
that has been done by the 

initiative so far and implore 
that it continue with full force 
and a consistent commitment 
to seeking student input.

While it is crucial that the 

University makes a rigorous 
effort to create an inclusive, 
diverse 
and 
equitable 

campus 
environment, 
this 

responsibility should not fall 
solely on the administration. 
The student body plays a 
critical 
role 
in 
bringing 

these attitudes into the U-M 
community. 
After 
all, 
the 

DEI itself was born in large 
part out of the activism of 
students, 
particularly 
the 

Black Student Union’s 2013 
#BBUM campaign. It has been 
six years since that effort, and 
we cannot expect the DEI plan 
to be successful without our 
involvement in its programs.

It is essential that students 

give their full participation 
in 
fostering 
a 
positive 

discourse with their peers. 
It is equally necessary that 
students maintain a dialogue 

with 
the 
administration 

and 
voice 
their 
concerns 

about diversity, equity and 
inclusion 
on 
campus 
to 

ensure the impact of the DEI 
plan is meaningful. Much 
of the DEI plan’s success is 
dependent upon the quality of 
its programs and initiatives. 
However, 
without 
student 

input, the plan is destined to 
become a mostly top-down 
venture. The University has 
set aside a significant amount 
of money to make changes 
students have argued for, 
and the student body should 
take full advantage of this 
opportunity. The forthcoming 
three-year 
report 
presents 

a chance to organize and 
engage. Hopefully, students 
will react to the findings with 
new ideas and a reinvigorated 
drive to make an impact as 
opposed to responding with a 
lack of interest.

As students, we have made 

it clear that having a campus 
that fosters diversity, equity 
and inclusion is one of our 
fundamental values. Contrary 
to what people such as Perry 
might 
believe 
regarding 

“administrative 
bloat,” 

these initiatives perform a 
vital role by bettering the 
campus climate. The focus of 
our community should now 
be to hold administrators 
accountable to the promises 
they 
made 
in 
the 
DEI 

strategic 
plan, 
to 
elevate 

the 
concerns, 
ideas 
and 

demands of students and to 
encourage more participation 
amongst the student body in 
bringing about this positive 
environment. 
We 
look 

forward to the release of the 
three-year report and the 
renewed sense of engagement 
we hope it brings.

RAMISA ROB | COLUMN

A game of silencing Sansa Stark

T

oday’s most popular and 
anticipated drama show, 
“Game 
of 
Thrones,” 

televises a brutal, misogynistic 
medieval world. Though the violent 
fantasy series has been criticized 
for its problematic use of rape as a 
plot device, it has also been praised 
for subverting the gender norms of 
the complex, fictional society and 
creating nuanced female leaders. 
From a compassionate, ambitious 
heroine in Daenerys Targaryen to 
an enigmatic, bloodthirsty villain in 
Cersei Lannister, the show tells us 
there are many ways to be a strong 
woman in Westeros — but is it the 
same in our real world?

In the discussion of femme 

power in the Seven Kingdoms, 
Sansa Stark, the stereotypically 
feminine character — who initially 
knits for leisure and wears pretty 
gowns — often misses the cut. Young 
Sansa, the underdog of tragedies in 
the show, amassed viewer distaste 
that was similar to the reactions to 
characters like Viserys Targaryen 
and Joffrey Baratheon and made it 
to a list of the six most despicable 
characters on “Game of Thrones,” 
with a paragraph that lambasted 
her as “utterly useless and whiny.” 
Memes about Sansa Stark have 
been milling around the internet, 
one of which features her realistic, 
painful expression when her father 
Ned Stark gets decapitated. The 
caption reads: “Bitch calm down, 
you cry like 99.9% of the time.” 
This hatred for Sansa Stark reflects 
internalized 
sexism 
towards 

traditionally feminine characters.

Many Reddit threads presently 

deem Sansa Stark deserving of 
what they call her “garbage life,” 
and criticize her for fancying the 
nefarious 
Joffrey 
(though 
we 

are shown she was conditioned 
to worship him as her future 
husband). In season one, episode 
six, when Sansa slowly begins to 
question Joffrey, he apologizes 
to her and says: “I will never 
disrespect you again,” and she takes 
his word for it. Yet she is the one 
blamed for perceiving the good 
in a vicious man. But this hatred 
for “gullible” women is familiar. 
Many young girls — myself 
included — chose manipulative, 
cocky men in our teen years and 
later bear the repercussions with 
the shamefaced label: stupidly 

falling for the bad boy.

Baffled by this abhorrence 

for such a relatable character, I 
asked my followers on Instagram 
through the story option: “Why is 
Sansa Stark not a strong character?” 
One of the responses stated: “She 
could pick up a sword once in a 
while like Arya.” Other answers 
included: “She is a dumb girl but 
learning.” All of the responses 
depict our inability to recognize a 
woman’s strength and intelligence 
when they are stereotypically 
feminine and lack masculine traits.

The comparison between Sansa 

and Arya has historically favored 
the latter, indicating a common 
Hollywood fallacy that a “feminist” 
story must focus on iconoclastic 
women 
who 
can 
physically 

fight like men. Arya Stark (who 
resembles a delinquent tomboy) 
has a much larger fanbase than her 
sister, Sansa, who encompasses the 
prototypical girly, privileged girl 
we’ve become accustomed to seeing 
in the real world. And similar to 
reality, her passivity throughout the 
show is misinterpreted as weakness 
by fans. Unlike other inherently 
badass female characters, Sansa is 
non-violent and does not give loud, 
rousing speeches.

It is this conformist femininity 

that the audience misconceives 
as her transgression because she 
isn’t the usual fantasy heroine. 
The preference for Arya arises 
from the inherent social pedestal 
of masculine characteristics and 
the hatred for Sansa parallels 
our animus towards “ordinary” 
girly 
women. 
The 
audience’s 

selective idolization of the Stark 
sisters mirrors some of the double 
standards present in our society 
today. If we are truly feminist, we 
should be able to credit all kinds 
of women as equally strong — 
tomboys, girly and androgynous. 
Our tendency to revere characters 
who aren’t like other girls and 
scorn Sansa Stark demonstrates 
normalized sexism.

The audience’s disdain for 

Sansa’s 
strength 
exhibits 
the 

skewed, sexist vision of female 
power in our world — one that 
precludes traditional femininity 
and symbolizes an implicit rebuke 
for passive, unassertive women. On 
the other hand, the writers of the 
show have attempted to balance 

the discourse on strong females, 
not privileging one narrative over 
another. In this groundbreaking 
show, where women own dragons, 
possess unworldly martial skills 
and sit on iron thrones, unarmored 
Sansa Stark fearlessly perseveres. 
In “Game of Thrones,” where 
characters have dropped like flies, 
Sansa Stark, the so-called lone wolf, 
has survived. But our inability to 
appreciate her perseverance shows 
how little we are able to accept 
traditionally feminine characters.

Arguably, Sansa Stark is the 

most 
reasonable 
and 
resilient 

character — one who snubs the 
idea that strength only stems from 
swords. Her internal fortitude 
remains consistent through five 
seasons of endless torture from her 
Lannister nemeses. Sansa has never 
needed a weapon or superpowers, 
because her proclivity to withstand 
pain with her bullet-proof vest 
brings her back to power in 
Winterfell. After winning the Battle 
of Bastards in season six, she kills 
her husband, Ramsay Bolton, and 
softly fires the most hard-hitting 
dialogue that distinguishes her 
unique competence from the 
supernatural 
charisma 
fans 

expect from leaders of both 
genders.

But no matter what she does, 

Sansa Stark remains unacceptable 
to some fans. After judging Sansa 
for her initial submissiveness, 
many 
remain 
vexed 
at 
her 

development in season seven. In 
2017, a mid-series TV Guide open 
letter to Sansa Stark berated her 
as overly aggressive towards Jon 
Snow and underestimated her 
ascension as “playing right into 
Littlefinger’s hands” — which, 
ultimately, proves false, because 
Lord Baelish is now dead. If we 
were all waiting for Sansa to 
unravel her “real” strength but 
cannot accept her leadership now, 
then we are erecting a spectrum 
of what constitutes acceptable 
“strong” female gender expression 
with a narrowing crevasse between 
weakness and hostility.

I

f it hasn’t happened to 
you yet, it soon will. 
You open up your social 

media for the first time during 
the day and there it is: the 
engagement photo. Maybe it 
starts with that girl you knew 
back in middle school, then a 
few acquaintances from high 
school. You are surprised at 
the high school sweethearts 
who made it this far (and 
skeptical of how long they will 
last).

I 
mean, 
that 
guy 
did 

cheat on all of his previous 
girlfriends. Then, one day, it 
will be a friend. You get that 
little shiver up your spine 
before pushing it out of your 
mind completely. It still isn’t 
completely real until — bam! It 
happens to your ex.

Yep. You open up your 

phone 
and 
see 
his 
mom, 

your mom and the whole 
community 
congratulating 

him on his engagement. Yikes. 
Now it’s real.

Meanwhile, 
you 
can’t 

even keep a cactus alive. You 
don’t know where you will be 
living in six months, let alone 
have anyone you’d remotely 
consider starting a life with. 
You still eat Kraft mac and 
cheese for dinner multiple 
nights a week and talk to your 
mom on the phone everyday. 
How on earth are people your 
age getting married?

Moments like these happen 

periodically 
throughout 

one’s life, but they just keep 
increasing in intensity until 
you reach what I have dubbed 
“the engagement epidemic.” 
There is the first time one of 

your friends has a boyfriend, 

the first time one of them has 
sex, the first teen pregnancy 
and on and on it goes.

However, thus far, nothing 

has hit me quite like the 
engagement 
epidemic. 
It 

seemed like one day it was one 
person and the next I blinked 
and my whole Instagram feed 

was filled with shiny diamond 
rings and happy tears. I was 
left wondering whether I was 
falling behind, or if everyone 
else had gotten ahead of 
themselves.

I always hear people make 

similar judgments, too. “Oh, 
they got married way too 
young,” and “they took things 
way too fast.” Or, conversely, 
“If they don’t get engaged soon, 
they are bound to break up,” 
or, “If they don’t find someone 
soon, it will never happen.” 
It seems like everyone has an 
opinion on love and what the 
right course of action is when 
choosing your path.

Some say you should be 

single and live life while you 
are young and wait until your 
late 20s — or even early 30s 
— to get married. Meanwhile, 
others say it is better to find 
someone you want to spend 
the rest of your life with while 
you are young so you can go on 
adventures with them. Then, 
most famously, there are those 
who always say, “When you 
stop looking, that is when it 
will happen.”

Yet, when I look back now at 

all the moments where I have 
received contradictory advice 
or where I felt like everyone 
was flying by me while I was 
stuck in quicksand, I don’t feel 
like I missed out. Everything 
that has happened in my life 
has happened right on time for 
me. Everybody has their own 
priorities and own experiences 
that all shape who they will 
become and how fast they are 
going to get there. By the time 
my mother was 23, she knew 
she was done with players. She 
said she pretty much hated 
men altogether and had nearly 
resigned in her quest to find 
the perfect one. She met my 
dad that same year and said 
within just a few weeks she 
knew he was the one. She told 
him she was giving him one 
year and no longer to make up 

his mind and propose. I’ve told 
that story to other people who 
say, “One year? My parents 
dated for six years — one is 
way too soon.”

Maybe 
the 
truth 
is 

we should all reserve our 
judgments about those doing 
life at different speeds than 
us. This sounds like the “yeah, 
duh” answer, but aren’t we 
all at least a little guilty of 
thinking we are doing it the 
better 
way 
or, 
conversely, 

worrying we are doing it all 
wrong? We expect to follow a 
linear path put forth for us by 
Hollywood clichés or we feel 
guilted by family members 
who have exceedingly high 
expectations. We feel lonely, 
sad or confused by all that 
is changing around us and 
everyone we know that is 
moving onto the next stage of 
their lives.

We should feel confident, 

however, that we will get 
there. So many older adults 
have said it must be true: life 
flies by in the blink of an eye. 
We shouldn’t wish a single 
moment of it to move faster 
and we can’t slow it down. 
When we spend our whole 
lives looking forward at what 
we want or backwards at 
what could have been we risk 
missing the wonderful stage 
of life we are in at the present 
moment. Never again will 
we be so young or so free. At 
risk of sounding like a cheesy 
pop song, I say we can’t afford 
to always be living life with 
regrets. We all make mistakes, 
take detours and trip over our 
own two feet. And though it is 
not the path for all of us, most 
of us will wake up one day 
feeling like we have met “the 
one.” I am sure it won’t happen 
a moment too soon or a second 
too late for a single one of us.

FROM THE DAILY

Keep Demanding Diversity and Inclusivity 
O

n Jan. 24, the U.S. Department of Education opened an investigation 
into more than 50 complaints filed by Mark Perry, University 
of Michigan-Flint economics and finance professor, against the 

University for discrimination against men. This has subsequently ignited a 
national discourse over the effectiveness of college diversity initiatives and 
the University’s own Diversity, Equity and Inclusion plan. His arguments that 
women-only spaces are discriminatory and that the DEI plan unnecessarily 
raises University costs are inflammatory and, more importantly, flawed. 
Spending on an initiative to bring about an inclusive environment cannot 
be dismissed as mere “administrative bloat,” as he purports it to be. These 
statements ignore the cultural history of gender-based discrimination and 
the multitude of other factors that contribute to rises in University tuition. 
However, the current attention on Perry brings to light the need for a closer 
look at the DEI initiative and if it has truly delivered on its promise of 
creating a more diverse and welcoming campus climate. 

The University has 

a responsibility 
to uphold values 
of inclusion and 

respect

Thursday, February 28, 2019 — 5

An old Daily Arts Writer used 
to call the Academy Awards “our 
Superbowl” in the sense that 
this was to be the Sunday night 
in February where we get wine-
drunk and yell at our illegal 
streams HDMI-ed to the T.V. I’m 
not perfectly down with this idea: 
A) because I don’t know if we 
should be making identity-politic 
statements that suggest you can 
only like one and not the other, 
and B) because I don’t know of 
anyone who watches movies that 
would want any ownership over 
the slate of nominations (and 
winners!) we got this year. But a 
football fan could say the same 
thing about their Superbowl this 
year, so maybe the analogy holds.
That being said, we went on and 
made this year’s Oscars as close 
to the Superbowl as we could. 
The film beat played a game of 
“Fantasy Oscars,” the whole setup 
the brain-child of our great writer 
Anish. Split into four teams of two, 
each pair of Daily film Writers 
drafted a team of four general 
nominees and one best picture 
nominee. If the same movie 
showed up in multiple different 
categories — an example being 
Spike Lee’s (“Do the Right Thing”) 
“BlacKkKlansman,” 
nominated 
for adapted screenplay, director, 
best 
picture 
and 
supporting 
actor — then each individual 
nomination was available to be 
drafted and scored separately. For 
their final Best Picture pick, the 
teams were allowed to choose the 
same nominee and drafted blind 
to avoid one team’s pick swaying 
another’s. Teams were told to 
pick based on what they thought 
should win, not on their own 
hopes and dreams.
We randomized the order, then 
snake-drafted from left to right to 
left in the order below. Each of our 
teams wrote little blurbs before 
and after the ceremony about their 
confidence/fears going into the 
night, as well as their reactions to 
how their teams fared.

BEFORE:

We 
believed 
“Roma” 
was 
owed many things. Art doesn’t 
always get the recognition it 
deserves, though, especially not 
in ethnocentric contexts, so we 
thought our safest bet would be 
“Roma” for Best Foreign Language 
Film. That was our first draft; our 
fifth was “Roma” for Best Picture.
The latter was a wish. My 
Nana sends me a screenshot 
of Rami Malek (“Mr. Robot”) 
holding an award every time she 
sees that he’s won something 
else for “Bohemian Rhapsody.” 
Given the number of these texts 
I’ve received, Malek’s Golden 
Globe win, this Oscar season’s 
generosity toward popular films, 
and the way Malek says “darling” 
with a British accent, he was our 
man for Best Actor.
Spike Lee has never been 
recognized as Best Director. We 
repeat: Spike Lee has never been 
recognized as Best Director. See 
our third draft pick.
Fourth, we drafted Regina 
King 
(“Watchmen”) 
for 
her 
performance in “If Beale Street 
Could Talk.” The best part of one 
of movie outings earlier this year 
was when I first saw the “Beale 
Street” trailer. The best part of the 
trailer, aside from its hint at the 
majestic score, is King’s majestic 
animation of his majesty James 
Baldwin’s words. She was the 
highlight of the film.

Writer

As we approach the end of 
this awards season, my cynicism 
about the Oscars has only grown. 
The Academy has proven, time 
and time again, that it is the out-
of-touch, mercurial trainwreck 
we believe it to be. To exacerbate 
what will be the shakiest Oscars 
telecast of the last few years, the 
nominees themselves are … less 
than stellar. For these reasons, 
picking our draft team was a 
coldly unemotional process. There 

was little conflict between 
my own wishes and my 
expectations for what films 
would win in each category: 
I rarely felt moved enough 
by even one nominee to 
hope for its success.
With 
that 
dose 
of 
pessimism out of the way, 
I do feel confident about 
my picks. First, we chose 
“Spider-Man: 
Into 
the 
Spiderverse,” a film that 
emerged seemingly out of 
thin air at the end of last year 
to 
overtake 
“Incredibles 
2” as the front runner for 
animated awards.
Next we chose Glenn 
Close (“Crooked House”), 
the star of a film I’ll 
probably never see called 
“The Wife.” As much as 
I hate to admit it, she’s 
confidently 
diminished 
Olivia Coleman’s (“Them 
that Follow”) and Lady 
Gaga’s (“American Horror 
Story: Hotel”) chances at 
the Best Actress award. 
Sorry Ally!
Our 
third 
choice 
is 
Mahershala 
Ali 
(“True 
Detectuve”) 
as 
Best 
Supporting Actor in the 
year’s most controversial 
movie, “Green Book.” As 
much as Sam Elliot (“The 
Ranch”) tearing up while 
backing out of the driveway broke 
my heart in “A Star is Born,” Ali is a 
strong favorite due to his typically 
measured 
performance 
and 
considerable detachment from the 
criticisms of “Green Book.”
Fourth, 
we 
chose 
“The 
Favourite” 
for 
Best 
Original 
Screenplay 
for 
little 
reason 
other than that it was a category 
frontrunner according to experts. 
(It’s also one of the two Best 
Picture nominees I loved.)
And finally, for our fifth pick, we 
overlapped with the other teams 
on the likely Best Picture Winner: 
Alfonso 
Cuarón’s 
(“Gravity”) 
“Roma.” “Bohemian Rhapsody” 
and “Green Book” lurk in the 
background as the dark horses 

that could shatter this outcome, 
but I guess we film writers are an 
optimistic bunch. It’s time to stop 
predicting and start praying.

— Anish Tamhaney, Daily Arts 
Writer

Assembling 
our 
team 
the 
week before Oscar Sunday, Team 
MichalskerHelm felt reasonably 
confident, but our confidence has 
waned as the night approaches. 
Our first three picks are solid, but 
the odds in the Lead Actor race 
have begun to favor Rami Malek 
as he has picked up other industry 
awards including the BAFTA 
and SAG equivalents of the Best 

Actor Oscar. The SAG is especially 
telling, as it’s usually a reliable 
indicator for the acting awards.
The Best Picture pick that 
makes up the fifth round is mostly 
meaningless as we’ve all picked 
“Roma,” but the race is a bit more 
complicated than that. “Green 
Book” is a strong if controversial 
contender, and there’s a chance 
that the acting branch of the 
Academy votes for “A Star Is 
Born” en masse to make up for 
the perceived snub for Bradley 
Cooper’s 
(“Avengers: 
Infinity 
War”) directing.
The same thing happened in 
2013 when Ben Affleck (“Justice 
League”) wasn’t nominated for 
“Argo,” which would go on to 

win Best Picture over the favored 
“Lincoln.” The preferential ballot 
– when voting for Best Picture, the 
Academy doesn’t vote for a single 
film, they rank the nominees 
which 
are 
assigned 
points 
accordingly – also means that 
more broadly appealing films like 
“Black Panther” have a shot, as 
well. Still, with Alfonso Cuarón’s 
masterful work behind the camera 
a lock for the Best Director trophy, 
“Roma” remains the favorite – no 
pun intended.

Arts Writer

AFTER:

Oscar Sunday was a whirlwind 
– no host, lots of sexual tension 
and some not-so-surprising wins. 
Though the ceremony opened 
with the trifecta to end all trifectas 
(Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph and 
Tina Fey), the Oscars eventually 
returned to its tried and true 
formula, proving that, for how 
progressive Hollywood likes to 
think it is, the system still rewards 
mediocre films for increasingly 
unclear reasons.
But it’s all fine if the good 
movies and people get awarded 
somewhere, right? Spike Lee’s 
talents were finally recognized 
with “BlackKklansman” for Best 
Adapted Screenplay (we were 
hoping for Best Director), but 
this and other wins were tainted 

when 
“Green 
Book” 
snagged 
Best Picture. Naively, our team, 
the whole section really, held out 
for “Roma” in this category – we 
put our faith in the Academy, 
hoping they would overcome their 
infatuation with “Green Book.” 
Unsurprisingly, though, they were 
hooked, and audiences will talk 
about this moment for years to 
come.
Overall, our draft team did 
relatively well: “Roma” won Best 
Foreign Language Film, Regina 
King picked up Best Supporting 
Actress and Best Actor went 
to Rami Malek for “Bohemian 
Rhapsody.” It was a predictable 
ceremony that really just left me 
wishing I could also give Samuel L. 
Jackson (“Glass”) a koala bear hug.

— Emma Chang, Senior Arts Editor

While I’m not surprised at all 
about it, I’m beyond happy that 
Cuarón received recognition for 
his direction. It’s the least the 
Academy could do to make up 
for their decision to give “Green 
Book” the Best Picture award. 
I’m excited to see what this win 
means for the artistic futures of 
both Cuarón and Netflix.
Deep 
down, 
I’m 
pretty 
surprised Colman won the Oscar, 
even though she was my draft pick. 
Glenn Close would probably have 
been the safer pick, considering 
she’s a seven-time Oscar nominee 
and 
this 
is 
Colman’s 
first 
nomination. While the cynical 
part of myself speculates that the 
Academy gave Colman the Oscar 
to give “The Favourite” some sort 
of recognition, I like to think they 
did because Colman simply gave 

the best performance of all the 
actresses nominated.
The 
Academy’s 
choice 
of 
“Green Book” for Best Picture 
makes it abundantly clear that the 
Oscars have long stopped being 
relevant in any way that matters. 
For “Green Book” to even be 
nominated, let alone win, shows 
just how out of touch Academy 
voters are. To choose “Green 
Book” over “Roma,” a nearly 
universally adored masterpiece, is 
a conscious vote for tradition over 
progress.

— Elise Godfryd, Daily Arts 
Writer

You never dream of a three-way 
tie when setting these things up, 
but alas, we will have to wait until 
next year to crown a champion 

of the Film section. Congrats to 
all three of the teams who scored 
three points. Ian and Anish will 
be both banished to the realm 
of 
reviewing 
terrible 
Netflix 
originals like “The Kissing Booth” 
or something.
I thought the ceremony ran 
very well without a host, and I 
hope, for the sake of all of our 
future Sunday nights, we won’t 
see a return to the old format any 
time soon. Other than adapted 
screenplay and best picture, I was 
pretty okay with the awards given 
out. It’s difficult to get excited for 
2018’s award season since 2017 
was such an unbelievable year 
(2016 too). Anything receiving the 
vaunted best picture award in a 
year like this, while movies like 
“Lady Bird,” “La La Land,” and 
“Whiplash” go on best-picture-

less, was never going to feel quite 
right. The best case would be, in a 
year like 2018, having the option 
to retroactively use our 2019 best 
picture award up on something 
that the Academy whiffed on in 
years past. In a perfect world, 
we went back on Sunday night to 
1990, to “Do the Right Thing,” to 
Spike Lee.
Oh well. On to the next year. 
Here’s hoping for bigger and 
better things with sounder, less 
offensive choices at the Dolby 
Theatre when we visit the Oscars 
again.

‘The Bones’

Maren Morris

Columbia Nashville

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘THE BONES’

If you’re into country music 
but don’t actually like country 
music, 
good 
news: 
Maren 
Morris is releasing her new 
album GIRL on March 8th. 
In case you weren’t paying 
attention, Maren Morris is an 
artist most famously known 
for 
her 
collaboration 
with 
Zedd on 2018’s most persistent 
EDM earworm, “The Middle.” 
Interestingly 
enough, 
the 
song places itself within a 
series of Morris’s pop music 
collaborations 
that 
spanned 
late 2017 to mid-2018 — it was 
meant to be characteristically 
uncharacteristic 
of 
her. 
However, GIRL stays true to the 
classic pop-country sound she 
introduced in her 2017 debut 
with Hero. And the exposure’s 
done well for promotion — her 
release of single “Girl” last 
month achieved the highest 
debut on the Country Streaming 
chart and overall highest weekly 
streams for a female country 
artist. Now, in the week leading 

up GIRL’s release Morris has 
released her track titles and 
another single, “The Bones.”
“The Bones” follows all the 
pop country conventions you’d 
expect: A gentle acoustic guitar 
intro, lyrics about love and its 
tribulations, claps, a dynamic 
lead up to the dramatic chorus 

— the list goes on. Just think 
about the way you felt listening 
to Taylor Swift’s Fearless for the 
first time 10 years ago and you’ll 
know what I mean. This isn’t 
to say the song is dated or that 
it lacks ingenuity; it’s gorgeous 
and deserves all that hype 
from the country comunity. 
The instrumentals are sparse 
and bare, providing special 

attention to each instrument 
that builds up to the chorus and 
the succeeding metamorphosis 
throughout 
the 
following 
verses. Morris’s vocal range 
is also astounding, shifting to 
falsettos effortlessly and adding 
some necessary texture to the 
song. And these aren’t just any 
old lyrics — try getting “the 
house don’t fall when the bones 
are good” out of your head.
“The Bones” is nothing new, 
but it deserves a space after that 
throwback Taylor Swift bop in 
your next “country” playlist. As 
a pop country hybrid, it serves its 
genre well in its amiable nature 
and capacity to capture feelings 
we don’t necessarily have to feel 
to understand. So get into the 
daydreams only your nine-year-
old self could conjure as you sing 
“Call it dumb luck, but baby you 
and I / Can’t even mess it up” 
into your hairbrush.

Rest assured, the world is 
on fire. From hunger, to war, to 
exploitations of the democratic 
system in America, everything 
is awful. It’s not a secret, but the 
world has collectively agreed to 
treat it as such. John Oliver wants 
to let us all in on the secret as gently 
as possible. In the sixth season 
premiere of his Emmy-winning 
news satire, Oliver takes on what 
many 
British 
parliamentary 
members are unwilling 
to: Brexit. Like with most 
of the abstruse news he 
covers, Oliver builds the 
horror show that is Brexit 
in incremental, satirical 
bits. That is, until he lets 
it all come crashing down.
Oliver wastes no time 
in recounting how the 
U.K. 
managed 
to 
get 
itself in this mess, first 
by comparing the term 
“Brexit” to calling an 
animal strangling “otter 
erotic 
asphyxiation.” 
Oliver 
explains 
that 
the U.K. was supposed 
to move in orderly stages in its 
transition. Instead, Prime Minister 
Theresa May’s colossal, 585-paged 
diplomatic trainwreck of a deal 
with the European Union has been 
rejected by Parliament. The U.K. 
is hurtling towards a March 29th 
deadline without a deal, and the 
consequences are dire. Some of the 
key ones Oliver delineates are the 
hard border in Ireland — Google 
“IRA Bombings” if you’re unsure 
of why this would be a problem — 
the lack of medicine, and how to 
transport one’s horse to and from 

other countries. (Oliver suggests 
removing its shoes and putting 
in through the X-ray belt at the 
airport.)
No good story is complete 
without 
a 
villain, 
and 
the 
antagonist Oliver settles on is Boris 
Johnson. Johnson is a member of 
Parliament for Uxbridge and South 
Ruislip, famous for poem he wrote 
about Turkish President Erdogan 
having sex with a goat, and was a 
prominent figure for the “Leave” 
vote in the 2016 referendum. Good 
thing his last name is a euphemism 
for “dick,” then. Oliver highlights 

a ridiculous incident in which 
reporters attempted to question 
Johnson about the hard border 
in Ireland, and Johnson ignored 
them. By riding away. Slowly. 
On his bicycle. This is probably 
because the only question Boris 
Johnson can answer, Oliver says, is 
“what would it look like if Gordon 
Ramsay was tumble-dried on 
high?”
Amid all the jokes, though, 
Oliver makes sure to remind us of 
how grim this situation is. By the 
government’s own findings, the 

U.K. economy is poised to fall by 3.9 
percent in 15 years when they leave 
the EU. However, if they leave the 
EU without a vote — which looms 
closer as a possibility, given that 
the EU is done negotiating — 
then the U.K. economy could fall 
by 9.3 percent. It is, in Oliver’s 
words, “like “Pompeii if Pompeii 
had voted for the volcano.” If that 
wasn’t bad enough, the U.K. is in 
position to experience medicine 
and food shortages, resulting in 
“Brexit Boxes,” which are boxes 
containing paint cans of wet meat 
for things like fajitas.
Any 
light 
at 
the 
end of the tunnel is 
quickly snuffed out. The 
“Breuinon Boys,” a Dutch 
boy-band 
whose 
sole 
purpose is to reunite the 
U.K. with the EU, is just 
as bad as it sounds. They 
are, Oliver says, a “pretty 
compelling argument to 
leave the EU under any 
terms necessary.” At the 
end of it, we get a rousing 
Churchillian 
speech 
about how valiantly “We 
will fuck ourselves” until 
we reach a victory that 
tastes like “mummified 
chicken fajitas.”
“Last Week Tonight” is bold 
and daring. John Oliver isn’t afraid 
of anyone and seeks to let us down 
as easily as possible, throwing 
in jokes to soften the blows. For 
everything that’s going wrong in

Last Week Tonight 
with John Oliver

Season 6 Premiere

HBO

Sundays 11 p.m.

I am currently playing bass in 
the pit orchestra of Runyonland 
Production’s “Merrily We Roll 
Along.” Last Sunday, we had our 
“sitzprobe” rehearsal. For those 
unfamiliar with the term, it’s 
German for “seated rehearsal.” It’s 
the first rehearsal with the pit and 
the cast in the same room, and it’s 
a chance for the everyone to focus 
only on the music without worrying 
about staging, choreography or 
dialogue.
Before the sitzprobe, a friend 
from the pit told me about 
how much he looks forward to 
sitzprobes. “It’s my favorite part of 
the rehearsal process,” he said. “It’s 
by far the most musical part of the 
show.”
My friend and I have both played 
in a couple of pit orchestras at the 
University of Michigan, and we’ve 
been through this rehearsal process 
many times. We know the drill with 
these shows: A week of two to three 
hour rehearsals after the sitzprobe, 
running through the show each 
night until the music becomes 
second nature. This is when the 
show comes together, individual 
scenes being repeated until the 
entire play flows seamlessly.
Personally, I’ve always found 
the opening night to be the most 
exciting part of the process. After 
so many rehearsals in front of a 
critical production crew, I love 
the energy that comes from a live 
audience — the laughs, cheers and 
applause at the end of every song. 
It’s this attention, energy, pride and 
adrenaline that makes the whole 
rehearsal process enjoyable for me.
But to my friend, the audience 
matters little in the rehearsal 
process. He does these shows to 
make music with strangers in a fun, 
collaborative environment. We are 
incredibly lucky to have one of the 
strongest musical theater programs 
in the world here at the University. 
There are few other places in the 
world where musicians have the 
opportunity to work with such 
incredibly talented actors and 
singers over the course of a week 
to pull together a coherent show. 
It is this process, and not the final 
product, that draws my friend to pit 
orchestra jobs.
This got me thinking about 
creator-centric art — art made for the 
artist’s sake. Terms such as this are 
frequently used to discredit certain 
artists and artistic movements, 
particularly more abstract styles 
from the 20th century. I’ve heard 

these works described as insular 
and inaccessible, their creators 
described as self-indulgent and self-
obsessed. Why should a layperson 
care about art not written for the 
layperson, as many have asked.
As 
a 
young 
musician 
and 
composer, I heard these criticisms 
launched at the dissonant, abstract 
music of the post-war European 
classical music composers. The 
late music of Schoenberg, for 

example, is built almost entirely on 
serialism. It is inexpressive in the 
Romantic sense almost by design 
— notes, rhythms and dynamics 
intentionally 
randomized 
past 
the point of comprehension. The 
composer indulges in logic puzzles 
and 
restrictive 
compositional 
processes with little to no regard for 
how the music may sound.
In becoming more familiar with 
this music, however, I have learned 
to get past this criticism. This music 
demands a different understanding 
than that of pre-atonal music. While 
one can choose to view this music as 
self-indulgent, one can also accept 
these indulgences and move past 
them. And though we may view 
this music as uniquely inaccessible 
and self-indulgent, this criticism 
has been levelled at art throughout 
history.
In musicology, for example, we 
recently studied the Beethoven 
piano 
sonatas. 
To 
modern 
audiences, they are the epitome 
of solo piano music. Nearly every 
pianist has played through at 
least one sonata. Many can call 
up multiple sonata openings from 
memory.
These pieces had a very different 
cultural connotation when they 
were 
composed: 
They 
were 
written not for aristocratic social 
functions or public concerts but 
for private study by the performer. 
These pieces, so quintessential 
to the public piano concert as 
we currently conceive of it, were 

once difficult etudes that rarely 
saw public performance. They 
are harmonically and melodically 
complex, both difficult to perform 
and difficult to consume. As such, 
they were not regularly appreciated 
by audiences of the day.
These pieces were criticized 
for the exact same reason that 
we currently criticize post-war 
classical music composers. They 
were written for the composer’s 
own interests, not for the mutually 
accepted standards of “beautiful” 
music in fashion at the time.
Another example of this is 
Beethoven’s “Große Fuge (Op. 
133).” This piece was derided upon 
its premiere for being rhythmically 
dissonant 
and 
harmonically 
incoherent. Even today, nearly 200 
years after the work was composed, 
audiences and string quartets still 
struggle to fully understand the 
piece. It’s a violent conglomeration 
of pseudo-atonal gestures, a work 
perhaps more at home among the 
Ligeti string quartets than the 
works of Beethoven’s immediate 
contemporaries.
If any piece of Beethoven’s is 
self-indulgent 
and 
inaccessible, 
it would be this piece. “And why 
didn’t they encore the Fugue? That 
alone should have been repeated!” 
Beethoven reportedly responded 
to the piece’s negative premiere. He 
cared little for what the audience 
thought of the work as he knew it 
was successful. And though it has 
taken the music-consuming public 
nearly 200 years to fully understand 
this work, it is beginning to move 
from the realm of self-indulgent 
to the realm of expressive and 
beautiful.
Some artists create for the sake 
of the audience member. Others 
create for the sake of creating. Both 
styles of creation have their benefits 
and their weaknesses. But neither 
can be valued over the other, nor 
can works created under one be 
criticized for this.
My friend in the pit orchestra, 
for example, participates in these 
pit orchestras for the music making 
opportunities. I participate in pit 
orchestras for the performances 
and the opportunity to present my 
work to others. What matters in the 
long run, I’ve begun to realize, is the 
quality of the art being created, not 
the means by which it is created. 
If an artist needs to make art for 
their own sake, so be it. So long as 
it has artistic value, the terms of its 
creation matter little.

Kayla and Kevin Robbins, and the power of Michigan women’s basketball

Sunday’s 
game 
against 
Michigan State was big for a 
lot of reasons for the Michigan 
women’s basketball team. Chief 
among them was a desire for 
revenge after the Wolverines’ 
77-73 defeat in January. But 
for Kayla Robbins, it was even 
bigger.
“I’m trying to get a win for 
the team,” the junior forward 
said before the game. “But if 
I could have some bragging 
rights back home that would be 
amazing.”
Robbins — who has been one 
of Michigan’s key contributors 
during the season’s stretch 
run — is the daughter of Kevin 
Robbins, 
a 
star 
offensive 
lineman 
for 
the 
Spartans’ 
football team from 1987-88. 
The Los Angeles Rams drafted 
him in the third round of the 
1989 NFL Draft, after which 
he played three seasons with 
the them and the Cleveland 
Browns.
As a third rounder, Robbins 
had to work hard to earn his 
spot on an NFL roster, just as 
he did when he arrived in East 
Lansing as a transfer student 
from Wichita State. His hard 
work helped him carve out a 
three-year stint in the league, 
and 
his 
determination 
is 
something that he passed onto 
his daughter when she began 
playing sports at a competitive 
level.
“Work extra hard — more 
than anyone else out there — to 
accomplish your goals,” he told 
her.
As 
Robbins 
continued 
to develop, she excelled in 
basketball, 
where 
Kevin 
quickly realized that she had 
immense potential. Despite her 
father’s athletic background, 
Robbins didn’t see Kevin as a 
football player and admitted 
that 
she 
didn’t 
realize 
her 
father’s 
connection 
to 
Michigan State at a young age.
“My family were MSU fans 
but I didn’t understand the 
closeness they had with college 
and stuff,” she said. “I guess 

you could say I was a Spartans 
fan.”
Even if she was a Michigan 
State fan, it became clear 
during Robbins’ recruitment 
process that there was one 
school in particular that was 
right for her: Michigan. Despite 
being his alma mater’s in-state 
rival, Kevin was thrilled.
“It’s real simple: Michigan 
was there for Kayla through 
thick and thin throughout the 
recruiting process,” he said. 
“It’s a major school in the Big 
Ten, and any time you get that 
opportunity it’s always a great 
thing.”
Kevin was thrilled to tell his 
friends about his daughter’s 
accomplishment. But it took 
some time to register with one 
friend in particular.

“One of Dad’s friends called 
me 
after 
my 
commitment 
and basically said, ‘You’re a 
Spartan!’ ” Robbins recalls. 
“He assumed because he heard 
Michigan that I was going to 
MSU. Until he realized I was 
playing in the maize and blue, 
then he finally called my dad 
and was so confused. But he 
was happy for me.”
While Kevin’s friend took 
some time to adjust to Kayla 
representing the Wolverines 
on the court, Kevin quickly 
jumped on the bandwagon.
“He wasn’t used to being in 
the maize and blue,” Robbins 
said. “But now he loves it.”
While 
Kevin’s 
allegiance 
may have changed, he still sees 
one familiar sight when he 
watches his daughter play: his 

own competitive spirit.
In Robbins’ third season, 
she has played some of the 
best basketball of her career, 
averaging a career-best 6.2 
points 
per 
game 
and 
3.5 
rebounds. 
With 
extended 
minutes during the Big Ten 
season, she has emerged as one 
of the team’s key contributors. 
Of course, Kevin has done 
his part and even managed to 
convert his Spartan friends 
into Wolverines.
Kevin recalled that earlier 
this year, he went with some 
Michigan 
State 
friends 
to watch Robbins and the 
Wolverines play a road game 
against Maryland. While they 
were still Spartans at heart, 
his friends turned up ready to 
support Robbins along with 

their longtime friend. That 
being said, they couldn’t bring 
themselves to wear maize and 
blue.
On 
Sunday, 
when 
the 
Wolverines finally traveled to 
East Lansing for their rematch 
against the Spartans, there 
was no question where Kevin’s 
allegiance would lie.
When 
the 
dust 
finally 
settled, 
Michigan 
State 
emerged victorious, 74-64, on 
Sunday afternoon, sweeping 
the season series and handing 
Michigan its first loss since 
Jan. 27. But Kevin won’t be 
using his bragging rights. The 
rivalry isn’t as serious as some 
might think in their home.
“For her, it’s not really a 
rivalry,” he said. “She doesn’t 
look at me as a Spartan.”

Now 
back 
home 
in 
Washington, D.C., Kevin says 
that he continues to rock the 
maize and blue even when he 
isn’t attending Robbins’ games. 
That stems from his pride in his 
daughter’s success and impact.
He sees his heart and hustle 
in her, even if she may be 
wearing 
unfamiliar 
colors. 
Even though it may be a school 
that many members of his alma 
mater love to hate, Kevin has 
nothing but love for Michigan.
“You know what, I feel 
like it’s a very fortunate and 
blessed situation for Kayla to 
be playing D-1 basketball at 
the highest level at the number 
one public school in the world,” 
Kevin said. “It’s definitely 
a good thing and I’m very 
blessed.”

n the moments after Sun-
day’s loss to Michigan 
State, a frustrated Isaiah 
Livers made 
his rounds 
through the 
Michigan 
locker room, 
approaching 
each team-
mate with a 
trio of ques-
tions.
What’s 
your goal?
What’s 
your motive?
What’s going on up there?
That type of overt leadership 
may seem out of place to any-
body who knows the sophomore 
forward. His most prominent 
postgame role is typically that 
of Jordan Poole’s sidekick — the 
radiant personality who fills 
any room with smiles. He rarely 
serves as an outward leader, 
a role mostly filled by Zavier 
Simpson and Charles Matthews.
But Sunday evening, Livers 
found himself in an all-too-
familiar situation. Just last year, 
the Wolverines endured similar 
February struggles, needing 
overtime to escape Minnesota at 
home and losing at Northwest-
ern. That was when the switch 
flipped for Michigan. After the 
loss to Northwestern, it didn’t 
lose again until the National 
Championship Game two 
months later.
“Everybody put their side 
agendas aside and played Michi-
gan basketball,” Livers said 
Wednesday. “I think that was 
the biggest step we made going 
in from late February into March 
when we got hot. Everybody 
put their — everybody stopped 
thinking about after the season, 
everybody was thinking about, 
we’re here now. We’re not gonna 
think about the future.”
This time around, though, the 
February surge that coach John 
Beilein’s teams typically exhibit 
has been reluctant to arrive.
The Wolverines, who paraded 

through their early-season slate 
with a world-beating sashay, 
know they’re not maximizing 
the potential that they displayed 
months ago. When asked where 
they have improved since early 
in the season, Matthews paused, 
futilely searching for answers 
before falling back on the cliché 
that they, “just continue to get 
better each and every day.”
The evidence disagrees. 
Michigan’s offense averaged 
73.2 points per game before the 
new year. In January, that fig-
ure dropped to 68.5. With one 
game to play in February, it sits 
at 67.1. On the other side of the 
ball, the Wolverines have gone 
from allowing just 57.9 points 
per game in January — the first 
month of Big Ten play — to 65.0 
this month.
“We didn’t have that fat L 
that a November loss is, cause 
we were 19-0,” Livers said. “So 
we kinda had to learn the harder 
way, in our conference, which 
kinda sucks.”
So Livers, remembering the 
Wolverines’ mid-season down-
falls a year ago, wanted to snuff 
out the type of distractions 
that hampered them then. But 
in the days since Sunday’s loss, 
he has found nothing but focus 
on Nebraska, Michigan’s next 
opponent.
And therein lies the problem. 
The struggles — at least rela-
tive to early in the season — are 
unanimously agreed upon. Solu-
tions aren’t, leading everybody 

to float their own theory.
“Just focus on the next day 
at task,” Matthews said. “We 
went on a run like that in March 
because we were just trying to 
win the day, each and every day. 
And we wasn’t getting too far 
ahead of ourselves. So if we can 
just stay in the moment, we’ll be 
good.”
But according to Livers’ 
postgame accounts, that isn’t a 
problem. Instead, he pins the 
struggles on Michigan losing the 
same voracious attitude that it 
had against Villanova and North 
Carolina. Against Michigan 
State, though, the Wolverines 
were clearly locked in from the 
tip in an electrifying opening 
half, but still fell, 77-70.
“It would be great to have 
everybody (on at the same 
time),” Beilein said. “But that’s 
been the biggest mystery so far.”
As Beilein finishes a 22-min-
ute presser rife with questions 
about the Wolverines’ recent 
struggles, he makes sure to fin-
ish with one final point.
“If you’re still competing for 
a Big Ten championship and it’s 
almost damn March, you’re hav-
ing a heck of a year.”
To make a Big Ten title — or 
any of its other goals — reality, 
Michigan has to rediscover the 
early season form that put it here 
in the first place.

For seniors, a long, worthwhile path

Nick Boka and Joseph Cecconi 
found themselves at crossroads 
to start their junior years.
After dishing out 10 assists 
and 
finishing 
plus-17 
as 
a 
freshman 
defenseman, 
Boka 
saw his production fall off a 
cliff the next year, scoring two 
total points. Beyond that, his 
confidence was shot. Those 
around him acknowledged his 
pedigree but Boka still knew 
himself that something wasn’t 
right.
With so much uncertainty, 
he faced a tall task as a junior. 
Fast forward to Senior Night 
last Saturday, and Boka skated 
around Yost Ice Arena, waving 
the 
Michigan 
flag 
proudly, 
completely sure of his ability and 
the culture he made.
Ask Boka how he improved, 
and he’ll point to one person in 
particular — Greg Harden. Once 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson and 
company took over, volunteer 
assistant coach Steve Shields sat 
down with Boka, and noticing 
his lack of confidence, directed 
him to the sports psychologist.
Though he was hesitant at 
first, Boka diligently met with 
Harden every week, honing in on 
different aspects of his mental 
game and bringing a more 
intense mindset to each practice.
“I didn’t know what I was 
getting myself into,” Boka said. 
“And it’s honestly been life 
changing, I can’t thank Shields 
enough for setting me up with 
him. I can’t thank Greg enough. 
He’s been there with me through 
the ups and the downs every 
single week.”
At this point, those meetings 
don’t entail working on much. 
More often than not, Boka goes 
in and talks about whatever he 
wants to with Harden, hockey-
related or not. Having that peace 
of mind, in the end, is how Boka 
found the confidence to step in 
as a leader, even before Michigan 
named him an alternate captain 

this season.
“Last year I tried to be a 
leader even without a letter on 
my jersey, and a lot of players 
did, which is why we had such 
a special team last year and why 
we did what we did,” Boka said. “ 
… There’s always going to be the 
voice in the locker room when 
someone thinks something isn’t 
going right or needs to step up. 
We have the ability to step up 
and talk to whoever needs to be 
pulling their weight.”
Cecconi helped build that 
air of accountability, too — 
albeit from a different place. 
Production wasn’t an issue for 
Cecconi. He was named to the 
USA World Juniors team during 
his sophomore year. When Red 
Berenson retired as Michigan’s 
hockey coach at the end of 
the year, though, so did the 
defenseman’s main reason for 
committing to the Wolverines.
As soon as he met Pearson, 
Cecconi went to work. Having 
been named an alternate captain, 
he worked with Pearson, captain 
Tony Calderone and the rest of 
the alternate captains to ensure 
that the Wolverines had their 
priorities set on hockey over 
anything else every day.
In turn, Cecconi became the 
team captain his senior year, but 
there was still a steep learning 
curve. When Michigan struggled 
to pick up wins this year, it 
forced the senior defenseman 
to become even more of a vocal 

presence in the locker room than 
before.
“It was not like I stepped in 
and was the best captain possible 
at the time,” Cecconi said. “I’ve 
learned a lot on how to be better. 
There wasn’t just one instance, 
but it was gradually building up. 
I feel much more comfortable 
speaking to the locker room or 
on the ice.”
Boka and Cecconi had every 
opportunity to give up and 
quit — the Minnesota Wild and 
the Dallas Stars, respectively, 
drafted them in the fifth round 
of the 2015 NHL draft. Cecconi 
had the option to sign with 
Dallas last summer yet eschewed 
it for a chance to further define 
the culture he helped start. 
Likewise, Boka chose to come 
back to Michigan to see if he 
could keep that night-to-night 
consistency.
While it seems unlikely that 
Michigan 
makes 
that 
same 
Frozen Four run, Senior Night 
let the two leaders reap the 
rewards of their hard work for 
a brief moment before one final 
push.
“I didn’t think that I was 
going to get too emotional,” 
Cecconi said. “But it really hit me 
after the game when they were 
playing the tributes of Brendan 
(Warren) and Nick (Boka), then 
myself, I teared up a little bit. 
How did this happen?
“How did four years go by this 
fast?”
