Upgraded facilities
come after strong
student input
By AMABEL KAROUB
DailyStaffRepoter
Fresh paint and and upgrad-
ed facilities welcomed almost
100 students Thursday to the
University's Trotter Multicul-
tural Center.
In January, the University
allocated $300,000 for renova-
tions at Trotter Center after
the University's Black Student
Union lobbied the administra-
tion for upgrades, among other
demands. The building hosted
its first open house Monday
after construction projects were
completed over the summer.
"Although it emerged out of
the Black action student move-
ments of the 70s, it has evolved
in its vision to cater to all stu-
dents, without losing sight of
the importance of signaling stu-
dents of color," said Rackham
student David Green.
The Trotter walls were newly
painted in vibrant gold and

browntones, the wood floor was
covered with a patterned rug
and colorful, abstract paintings
lined every side of the room.
The beauty of the building did
not come cheap.
Rackham student Portia
Hemphill said someone who
had not been to Trotter before
the renovation would not
understand the drastic differ-
ence in the decor.
"If you looked at it before you
would know there's a huge dif-
ference," Hemphill said. "This
room is much more warm and
inviting, there are new pictures
to make the room feel like asafe
haven, a safe space, a warm,
inviting climate."
Green said the renovation is
not purely aesthetic, but also
of people involved in the center
and minds leading it.
"Not only do we have a new
director, not only do we have a
new programming board, but
we have a new philosophy and
a new mission," Green said.
"To always think about what
the students need and how we
can best meet those needs as a
way to fulfill the promise of thg

DETROIT
Urban farming's growing
popularity draws students

Programs focus on
access to fresh food
and revitalization
By NEALA BERKOWSKI
Daily StaffReporter
While homegrown food
is nothing new to the city of
Detroit, a new wave of enthusi-
asm for urban farming is entic-

ing longtime residents and
University students alike to
start growing.
Detroit, which continues
to grapple decades-old issues
of blight and vacant lots, has
plenty of land prime for farm-
ing. Urban farming has become
increasingly popular in the last
10 to 20 years, allowing Detroi-
ters to grow the city new roots
through agriculture. The farms
and gardens are being used to

help the city not only as a food
source but also by connecting
community members.
The trend has garnered both
regional and national media
attention as the conversation
on how to repurpose unoccu-
pied urban properties continues.
Although the movement towards
agriculture in Detroit is called
"urban farming," many of its
participants are technically gar-

fireside chat in Union CSG unable to fund LEAD

University President
discusses diversity,
athletics on campus
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffRepoter
Though the room didn't have
a fireplace, University President
Mark Schlissel held his first fire-
side chat Thursday afternoon
with about 30 students in the

Willis Ward Lounge of the Mich-
igan Union.
Fireside chats are discussions
with the University president for
a group of randomly selected stu-
dents, a tradition begun by Uni-
versity President Emerita Mary
Sue Coleman.
During the hour-long event,
Schlissel fielded questions from
students on a variety of topics,
including the Munger Graduate
Residences project and North
Campus culture, and asked them

questions of his own on topics
like athletics.
"I'm trying to find ways to
reach out and learn about what
the student experience is like
here, and what I can do to protect
the things that are really good,
and to fix the things that aren't
quite working right," he told stu-
dents at the start of the chat.
LSA senior Joseph Jozlin
asked Schlissel about the bal-

Due to legal reasons,
scholarships must
be funded by alumni
By WILL GREENBERG
DailyNewsEditor
The devil is in the details.
Originally part of Central
Student Government President
Bobby Dishell's campaign plat-
form last spring, the additional
funding destined for the LEAD

Scholars program from CSG has
been canceled due to legal con-
straints.
LEAD is a scholarship pro-
gram from the University's
Alumni Association, which pro-
vides merit-based scholarships
to minorities. Under the 2006
Michigan Civil Rights Initia-
tive - better known as Proposal
2 - the University itself is not
allowed to give scholarships
as an affirmative action ini-
tiative. However, because the
Alumni Association is a 501(c)

(3) separate from the University,
they have been providing these
scholarships themselves to help
improve diversity on campus.
Dishell, a Public Policy junior,
said he originally believed that
because CSG is also its own
501(c)(3) that its funds could be
given to the LEAD as part of
Dishell's efforts to reach out to
underrepresented demograph-
ics. However, Dishell learned

Colorado woman implicated

Teenager pleads
guilty to aiding
extremist conspiracy
DENVER (AP) - A 19-year-old
Colorado woman pleaded guilty
Wednesday to trying to help the
militant Islamic State group under
a plea deal in the terrorism case
that requires her to give authorities
information about other Americans
with the same intentions.
Shannon Conley, wearing a
black and brown headscarf over
her striped jail jumpsuit, entered
the plea in federal court to one
count of conspiracy to provide
material support to a foreign ter-
rorist organization. She could
face up to five years in federal
prison and a $250,000 fine when
she is sentenced in January.
Conley, a nurse's aide from

Arvada, said nothing in court,
aside from acknowledging that she
understood the terms of the plea
that says she must divulge informa-
tion about possible co-conspirators.
Prosecutors saidtheywill seek a
lighter sentence if she cooperates.
After the hearing, Conley's pub-
lic defender, Robert Pepin, said she
has been horrified by the atrocities
committed by the Islamic State
group since her arrest and offered
her condolences to those who have
been caught up in its "slaughter
and oppression."
"The fact that she was arrested
may very well have saved her,"
Pepin said of his client, whom he
referred to as Halima, the name
she adopted after her conversion
to Islam.
The FBI first became aware of
her growing interest in extrem-
ism last November after Conley
alarmed employees of an Arvada

church by wandering around and
taking notes on the layout of the
campus, court documents say.
The church, Faith Bible Cha-
pel, was the scene of a 2007 shoot-
ing in which a man killed two
missionary workers.
Agents with the Joint Terror-
ism Task Force then met several
times with Conley over eight
months to discourage her and
suggestshe explore humanitarian
work instead.
Agents also encouraged her
parents to talk to her about find-
ing more moderate beliefs.
But Conley said she wanted to
use her American military train-
ing with the U.S. Army Explor-
ers in a holy war overseas, even
though she knew it was illegal,
authorities said. She added that
she would use her medical train-
ing to aid the group if she could
not fightcwith them.

Republicans and
Democrats reach
consensus about
ISIS engagement
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Bending for once to the will
of the White House, Republi-
cans and Democrats coalesced
Thursday behind President
Barack Obama's call to train
and arm Syrian rebels fight-
ing Islamic State militants and
pointed toward votes in the heat
of a midterm election campaign.
"We ought to give the presi-
dent what he's asking for,"
House Speaker John Boehner,
R-Ohio, said, although he swift-
ly added that many Republicans
believe the Democratic com-
mander in chief's strategy is
too tepid to crush militants who
have overrun parts of Iraq and
Syria and beheaded two Ameri-
can journalists.
H0-U

On the 13th anniversary of
the 9/11 attacks, Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said
he expected legislation ratifying
Obama's request to clear Con-
gress by the end of next week
when lawmakers hope to wrap
up their work and go home to
campaign for re-election.
Congress' two other top offi-
cials, Senate Republican leader
Mitch McConnell and .House
Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi,
also said Obama would likely get
the support he seeks.
Congress is in the midst of a
two-week session that had been
expected to focus on domestic
issues, principally legislation
to extend routine government
funding beyond the end of
the Sept. 30 budget year. That
agenda changed abruptly on
Wednesday night, when Obama
delivered a prime-time speech
from the White House seek-
ing "additional authorities and
resources to train and equip"
rebels. The forces are simul-
O5-

--l"

Innovation in Action:
Solutions to Public Health Challenges

taneously trying to overthrow
Syrian President Bashar Assad
and defeat militants seeking to
create an Islamist caliphate in
the heart of the Middle East.
Obama says he already has
the authority to order airstrikes
against militants in Syria,
although so far, those attacks
have come only in neighboring
Iraq.
The White House and many
lawmakers say deployment of
U.S. troops to train and equip
Syrian rebels - activity planned
to take place in Saudi Arabia -
would require additional con-
gressional approval.
Onthe morningafter Obama's
speech, the administration
deployed a battalion of officials
to brief lawmakers, including
Gen. Martin Dempsey, chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Defense Secretary Chuck
Hagel and Secretary of State
John Kerry are expected to tes-
tify in next week at public hear-
ings in advance of any votes in
Congress.
There was a strong political
subtext to the developments,
eight weeks before voters pick a
new House and settle a struggle
for Senate control.
Asked whether the topic
would be part of the campaign
now unfolding, Sen. Jeanne
Shaheen, D-N.H., who is on the
November ballot, said, "Every-
thing is going to be an issue."
"We do not want to go
home without voting on some
measure that goes toward
destroying and defeating ISIS
wherever it exists," said Rep.
Michael McCaul, R-Texas, using
an alternate acronym for the
militants.
Reid accused Republicans of
taking cheap political shots at
the president, and said, "This is
a time for the rhetoric of cam-
paign commercials to go away."
At the same time, candidates
seeking re-election will bel
required to vote on the presi-
dent's request, and challeng-
ers will be on the spot to state
their positions.

Yahoo said Thursday the gov-

Millions wasted
in housing project
for border patrol
The federal government wast-
ed millions of dollars in build-
ing a housing project for Border
Patrol agents in Arizona near the
Mexican border, spending nearly
 $700,000 per house in a small
town where the average home
costs less than $90,000, a watch-

The analysis by the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security's
inspector general found that U.S.
Customs and Border Protection
overspent by about $4.6 million on
new houses and mobile homes in
the small town of Ajo southwest
of Phoenix. The agency has spent
about $17 million for land, 21 two-
and three-bedroom houses and 20
mobile homes. Construction was
completed in December 2012.
Customs and Border Protection
paid about $680,000 per house
and about $118,000 per mobile
home, according to the report.
The average home cost in Ajo is

ing of the guard by the flagpole.
After folding in the 1970s, the
University's chapter of Young
Americans for Freedom was
restarted this semester. Strobl
said the organization is a non-
profit, non-partisan group that
advocates the ideas of free mar-
ket, limited government and a
strongnational defense.
The "9/11: Never Forget Proj-
ect" arrived at the University
four years ago. While this year
Young Americans for Freedom

sponsored the project, the Col-
lege Republicans and the ROTC
have organized the memorial in
recent years.
The project was created by
the Young America's Founda-
tion in 2003. This year over 200
high school and college cam-
puses from across the nation
participated in the project.
"We want this to be here for
a number of years going for-
ward," said Business junior
Brad Fingeroot. "... People that
don't remember it at all can
still remember the tremendous
human sacrifice that we had to
go through and the loss of life."


LEAD
From Page 1A
General Council that because
the student government's bud-
get comes from student fees, it
is part of the University's funds,
meaning a transfer of CSG bud-
get money specifically for this
scholarship would be in viola-
tion of Proposal 2.
Dishell said he started work-
ing on this effort at the end of
the Winter 2014 term when he
started communicating with
the Alumni Association, but
was informed of the legal issue
early in the summer.
The original plan was to
contribute $10,000 to LEAD,
roughly the equivalent of two
scholarships, and there was
discussion of a matched dona-
tion from an alumnus to create
a total of four new scholarships,
Dishell said. He said it was
intended to be part of a larger
effort to improve diversity this
year.
"The goal was not so much
the amount as it was the act,
the demonstration that CSG
cares about this issue and this
was a way that we knew was
incredibly effective at getting
underrepresented students to
campus," he said.
Dan Lijana, director of com-
munications for the Alumni
Association, said despite being
unable to help fund LEAD
scholarships, CSG can be a
great ally to the association as
they work on diversity. Lijana
said there are still many other
opportunities for the two orga-
nizations to join forces.
"We're very open to continu-
ing the kind of conversations
that would be independent of
needing an office of general
council to get involved," he

said. "I think the best potential
example of that is if there were
a student initiative sponsored
by CSG or sponsored by another
student entity on campus that
had an interest in raising money
for LEAD that didn't have some
relation to University funding."
Dishell said CSG alone will
also continue to pursue their
options for improved diver-
sity. He said the efforts already
underway have been effective
and that CSG will research
ways to improve and expand
upon current diversity initia-
tives.
Diversityhasbeenatthefore-
front of the University admin-
istration's goals this semester,
with University President Mark
Schlissel identifying it as one of
his top priorities. On-campus
diversity issues became a major
discussion point last year fol-
lowing events like the Black
Student Union's #BBUM cam-
paign, which shed light on the
experiences of Black University
students, and the Schuette v.
Coalition to Defend Affirmative
Action decision, which upheld
Michigan's ban on affirmative
action in public higher educa-
tion institutions.
Because of these constraints,
University administrators have
noted the difficulty of try-
ing to enroll more minorities,
though some options have been
explored.
Additionally, partially
spurred by the BSU's seven
demands for administrative
action last year and partly
through efforts by CSG and LSA
Student Government, policies
such as the Race and Ethnic-
ity curriculum requirement are
being evaluated for their effec-
tiveness in better educating stu-
dents on and exposing them to
other cultures and narratives.

said.
Schlissel said it came down to
the bigger question of how much
influence donors should have at
the University, and added that
he wasn't opposed to saying no
to a donor if there wasn't con-
sensus on the project between
them and the University.
"In this instance, it was a
tough call, because I actually
think it is important to have
graduate housing," he said of the
Munger project. "And I think
it's important in particular for
many of our graduate students
that come from other parts of
the world that have a challeng-
ing time in the first year or so in,
the United States."
Discussing North Campus
issues, students highlighted
both positive aspects, such as
the resources available and the
community of engineers and
other students, but also con-
cerns of physical and social

isolation, especially for fresh-
men, 60 percent of whom live on
North Campus.
In response, Schlissel agreed
more could be done to improve
the quality of life for students
on North Campus and efforts in
that are ongoing.
"The best idea that I've heard
so far is to build up community
on the North Campus so that it's
as vibrant socially, and in terms
of the activities that are on the
main part of campus," he said.
Schlissel also asked several
questions of his own, with a
focus on collegiate athletics and
the role they play in University
life. Students touched on several
issues in their responses, includ-
ing a weaker home schedule for
football this year, University
Athletic Department funding
and student experience on game
day.
In a sentiment echoed by
several students, Public Policy
junior Jennifer Arnold said
it seemed like the focus had
shifted more towards the brand
of athletics, not the people
involved.
"It doesn't seem as student-
run, or as marching band-
involved, as it used to be," she
said.
LSA senior Clarence Stone
agreed.
"It seems like the Athletic
Department is just expanding
with all the money that they're
receiving, with donations from

Stephen M. Ross when other
programs might need those
donations just as mnuch," he said.
"I feel like right now it's becom-
ing more focused on the brand
of Michigan athletics instead of
being something for the athletes
and the school."
Schlissel told students that
the prominence of athletics was
something he wanted to find a
balance on for the University.
"I think the whole thing is
balance," he said. "We don't
want to go crazy overboard
because I think Michigan should
be known for the breadth of the
things it does."
He added that he thought the
center of the game day experi-
ence should be the people.
"I really think it has to be
focused on all the people who
are a part of our permanent
community, coming together to
enjoy a football game on a Satur-
day," he said.
In an interview after the
event, Schlissel said the hope
is for the chats to be a regular
occurrence as long as students
continue to be interested. He
said he appreciated the way stu-
dents approached talking about
issues on campus.
"Everyone has positive things
to saytheyhave criticalthingsto
say," he said. "But the criticism
is offered without negativism.
They were offering suggestions
on how to make the place better,
and that's great."

Michigan experience."
Hemphill and Green are
members of an inaugural com-
mittee, the Trotter Program-
ming Board, a team in charge
of executing events for diver-
sity. Green said the board came
about as a result of a number of
crises faced by students of color
last year.
"The BBUM campaign
was a part of that, the tuition
hikes, immigration reform,"
Green said. "All of those
things coalesced to provide
the impetus to create this
board."
Although the Trotter build-
ing has now been renovated,
Simpson said she is doing every-
thing in her power to pursue the
long time goal of Trotter having
a building closer to the heart of
Central Campus. She said the
current Trotter is meant to be

a safe setting for students in the
interim.
"I've been at the University
for 17 years," Simpson said.
"I've been firmly committed for
17 years to there being a multi-
cultural center on Central Cam-
pus."
Simpson said while her light
skin color caused concern when
she was appointed as director
of Trotter, she dispelled these
doubts by emphasizing the
diversity of her life experiences.
"I'm also Spanish. I'm also a
lesbian. I also grew up working
class," she said. "What I know
is that, while I am perceived in
that way, there's a lot more that
makes me who I am than the
color of my skin."
University President Mark
Schlissel and E. Royster Harp-
er, vice president of student life,
were both present at the event.
Green said he expects Schlis-
sel to work extremely well with
Trotter.
"I believe in him 100 per-
cent," he said.

FARMING
From Page 1A
deners because of the small scale
of their projects, Hantz Farms
President Michael Score said.
"People grabbed onto urban
farming as a name, and there
is not an absolute definition
of a farm, so when someone is
gardening and they say they're
a farmer, why would you
argue with them?" Score said.
"There's nothing wrong with
being a gardener but for some
people, they want what they
consider the prestige or the sta-
tus of beinga farmer."
LSA senior Nick Breslin,
who farmed with Detroit-based
group Keep Growing Detroit
over the summer through
Semester in Detroit, a Univer-
sity program where students do
internships and take classes in
the city, said the organization's
goal is to improve the access
to fresh food and foster a cul-
ture of sustainability. Detroit
residents have seen decades of
limited resources in neighbor-
hoods, including food deserts
and inadequate police forces,
among other things.
"In Detroit, there really isn't
that much money so people
have to learn to do things them-
selves," Breslin said. "Three
years ago, the police response
time was 45 minutes on a 911
call. Since the services aren't
available, people find ways of
doing it themselves. Urban gar-
dening is the biggest one of all
since Detroit has almost no gro-
cery stores."
KGD helps Detroiters with
urban farming by giving them
the tools to have their own
farms, and also by showing
them how to use these tools.
They also allow their Grown
in Detroit members - a pro-
gram run by KGD - to sell
their produce with them at
the city's popular Eastern
Market, and split the profits
evenly.
Though urban farming
in Detroit is made possible
by the 40 square miles of
vacant land, portions are
unfit for safely growing food.
Detroit has a problem with
severe lead and heavy metal
ground pollution in some
areas thanks to its industrial
past and present. KGD pro-
vides testing services to see
if a given locality can sustain
produce.
"If there is lead in the
ground, we recommend that
you don't even dig because
there's lead in the dust and it
can really harm children and
the elderly," Breslin said.
For neighborhoods where
urban farming has blos-
somed, Score said Hantz
Farms in particular has
helped to reduce crime
through their landscaping.
"It's harder to commit
crime in a full neighbor-
hood," Score said. "If half of
the houses are lost to fore-
closure and abandoned, now

those structures provide hid-
ing places for illegal activity. If
I'm dealing contraband and I
use a warehouse and the police
find it, they can't track me down
because I don't own the prop-
erty."
By tearing down vacant
structures, mowing grass and
planting trees on empty land,
Hantz Farms takes away the
environment that criminals use
to their advantage.
"If we rip out all the brush
and tear down abandoned
houses and keep the grass
mowed, now when somebody
commits a crime it's out in
the open," Score said. "Even
if there aren't any houses on
that street or on that block, you
can see two, three, four streets
over. Somebody can see you.
Today, everybody has a cell-
phone with a camera on it, so if
someone is committing a crime
they have the sense that they
are visible and vulnerable."
Starting an urban garden
in Detroit on less than an acre
does not require permission
from the city, but farming with
multiple acres requires per-
mits and, not infrequently, time
spent in court. Some Detroi-
ters simply use vacant land in
Detroit once maintained by the
city or the school system for
farming without payingthe city
or acquiring permits.
"I know of one guy who is
mowing and baling hay and he
probably has 10 to 20 acres but
he doesn't own the land, but he
is harvesting stuff that's growing
on public property," Score said.
Some Detroiters also illegal-
ly keep livestock within the city
limits, mainly because it goes
unreported by neighbors who
receive fresh eggs or milk.
Along with its fundamental
uses, urban farms and gardens
are also established to create a

sense of community in Detroit
by bringing people together to
work towards a common goal.
LSA junior Meredith
Burke planned a future veg-
etable garden over the sum-
mer for Neighbors Building
Brightmoor, a nonprofit that
provides support systems
including housing for vul-
nerable Detroiters. Her work
included meeting with land-
scape architects, finding out
what kinds of produce the res-
idents of Brightmoor wanted
to grow and making sure the
garden would be functional
for residents with disabilities.
"A lot of the people (in
Brightmoor) are low income or
no income so most of the food
they eat is processed and comes
out of plastic bags," Burke said.
"An urban garden would give
them fresh non-chemical, non-
synthetic food, and it's also
building that community of
working together for a com-
mon goal. There are so many
resonating and kind of rippling
effects that are associated with
an urban garden."
University alum Tyson
Gersh, president and co-
founder of Michigan Urban
Farming Initiative, said Mich-
igan students have a lot to
offer to Detroit. He became
interested in, urban farming
from his landscaping experi-
ence that helped him pay for
college and founded MUFI on
the principles of education,
sustainability and the commu-
nity of urban farming.
"You can't expect people
overnight to become enlight-
ened and inspired to commit
their lives to a good cause, but
a lot of students have unique
skill sets or are developing
skill sets that there's not a lot
of access to in Detroit," Gersh
said.

Never too safe
Additional emergency precautions can save lives in future crises.
Wednesday at 8:55 a.m., an emergency alert - in
the form of text messages, emails, phone calls and
social media - notified students and faculty of a
reported man with a gun entering the Chemistry Building. It
was later discovered that the weapon was not real, and instead
was a "rubberized" replica used for ROTC training. While this
event has shed light on the potentially serious concerns with
emergency safety communication and procedure, the incident
that created this situation was the result of an oversight. In
response, ROTC has said it will implement new procedures,
which will hopefully prevent another occurrence.

Rethinking the melting pot

ong before I first thought
about what love was, I
imagined my wedding in a
Catholic church
in California.

at some critical
crossroad in my
childhood logic,
I deemed this the appropriate setting
for an American wedding. I felt no
particular affinity with the Catholic
Church, nor did I feel any real
longing to eventually be married, but
imagining it seemed an important
ritual to undertake. Something that
people do on the long and narrow
road that culminates in ashimmering
mirage of adulthood.
My paternal grandparents were
fairly devout Catholics and in the
intermittent summers when we
would live with them I would be
expected to adopt their faith, a nod
of respect to my father's family. On
these humid summer Sundays, I
would sit in the front bench seat of
the old Buick and watch for blue
herons in the tall bay grass of the
Chesapeake as we drove into a town
of slanted wooden houses and tuna
sandwiches; a town so polar opposite
from my dusty and sweet desert
home of minarets and bougainvillea
that it seemed like a dream. It made
me vaguely sick to my stomach, the
feelingthat I was alive in some other
person's memory - an incarnation
of a period of time where some
sensations had been amplified and
others forgotten entirely.
We attended mass in a small stone
church made large and imposing by a
stained glass depiction of St. Patrick

a dark and unforgiving sea. I remem-

the nun who taught catechism on
Sundays, "he is hurt."
"He died for your sins,"
she responded in a tone that
addressed none of my anxieties but
suggested resolution.

The event illuminated shortcomings
in the University's system in responding
to a potential real, active shooter or
other situations of imminent danger. The
original alert was delayed in reaching many
intended recipients, and many students were
uninformed about the event for a period of
time that could have proven dangerous had
the situation been a genuine threat. Further,
both students and faculty demonstrated
limited understanding of emergency protocol.
Though this situation was fortunately a false
alarm, it revealed the dire need to improve
campus response to similar situations in
the future.
While the University Police sent out
its alert within minutes of learning that
there was a possible armed suspect on
campus, cellular service providers, weather
conditions and other technological problems
created a lag in when students and faculty
received the information. Many did not
receive the message at all. These initial
alerts are incredibly important as they allow
students to take the necessary precautions
to avoid exposing themselves to danger in
the crucial minutes before law enforcement
arrives to contain the situation. While text
messages and e-mails are logical forms
of communication to widely disseminate
information, both are subject to the
unreliability of cellular service and internet
connections. University Police Chief Robert
Neumann has said that DPSS is constantly
working to improve their emergency alert
system. Obviously, it's impossible to create
a 100 percent fail-proof alert system, but
the discovery and implementation of more
reliable forms of communication for future
crises - such as a P.A. system or lockdown
alarm system similar to fire alarms - may
save lives.
In the meantime, campus safety can be
significantly improved if more students and
staff sign up for the University emergency
alerts. According to a DPSS spokesperson, less
than 35 percent of students are subscribed
to receive DPSS text messages. The more
studentsthat sign up for this service, the more
widely urgent information will be spread

across campus, decreasing the chance that
anyone will be late in receiving potentially
life-saving information. Changing the status
quo from an opt-in system to an opt-out one
could make a tremendous difference.
Concerns also arose in regard to the
scarcity of information in the DPSS alerts.
Even after the "all clear" message, students
were unsure of what had happened and felt
uneasy resuming normal activities without a
full explanation. In crisis events, the priority
is to notify all necessary personnel as quickly
as possible; brevity is expected and often
necessary. Even the "all clear" resolution
message is time-sensitive for reducing undue
stress. But, afterward, when all urgent alerts
have been sent out, DPSS should consider
delivering a follow-up alert summarizing the
situation. The DPSS spokesperson says that
these emergency alerts are limited to a 100
character limit. If this restriction becomes
limiting, DPSS should alert students that
more information can be found online on its
website. It is better to err on the side of excess
information rather than too little, especially
in emergency situations.
In addition to the communication
concerns, this incident raises questions about
the emergency preparedness of University
staff and faculty. Some graduate student
instructors, if not all, are not required to
undergo emergency protocol information
or training sessions. Even if the University
continues to forgo critical training for
all employees, it should mandate a safety
training session for faculty who are routinely
overseeing large groups of students -
professors, lecturers, GSIs, etc. This will
not only improve the safety of both staff and
students, but can prevent panic and chaos
if students know that faculty members are
properly trained. Mandatory emergency
training is widely required in K-12 education
and with large classes at the university level,
such courses become even more critical.
Emergencies are unpredictable and
maybe even inevitable, but with continual
improvements to DPSS communication
systems and proper training for University
faculty, tragedies can be prevented.

Accompanied by my father, the
owner stood in the doorway asking
the same cliche questions about my
major, my year and whether or not I
was enjoying college. The owner -
after apathetically nodding to each
of my answers - saw my exhaustion
and attempted to reassure me by
insinuating days of manual labor

that a higher salary and a certificate

While the statement may be an
isolated incident of arrogance in the
workplace, I've encountered this
elitist viewpoint before. College is
an institution designed to foster
independent thinking and to culti-

a pathway to a pedestal. Individuals

Four years
later, Birbiglia
directed the
film version, which premiered
at the Sundance Film Festival -
winning an Audience Award and
becoming one of the year's top
three most critically-acclaimed
comedies on Rotten Tomatoes.
In 2011, his second one-man
show, "My Girlfriend's Boy-

ran for four months and won the
Lucille Lortel Award for Out-

the run, Birbiglia has performed

that encapsulates the entire act,
but Birbiglia says "Thank God
For Jokes" diverges from this
method.
"After "Sleepwalk With Me"
and "My Girlfriend's Boyfriend,"
which are both very story-driv-
en things, I wanted to make a
show that was just the funniest
show I could create ... In the pro-
cess of doing that, what emerged
was this through-line about
jokes and basically how much
jokes mean to me."
"In some ways, jokes are like
a language." Birbiglia contin-
ued. "They're like a way that
people communicate with other
people who have a good sense of
humor. In some ways, my shows
are kind of like a series of inside
jokes between me and the audi-
ence."
It's this intimate, personable
style that distinguishes Birbiglia
from other comedians. "TIME

Magazine" calls him a "master
of the personal, embarrassing
tale," and "The New York Times"
describes him as a "supremely
enjoyable monologist." Birbiglia
insists it's all about honesty.
"(The style)'s not something
that comes to my mind as much
... I'm just trying to be true to
myself when I write. I'm trying
to get to the bottom of what's
under every story ... I follow the
muse of'Why."'
Obviously, Birbiglia's style has
turned some heads and captured
audiences' attention. In the past
few years, he's made more than
40 network television appear-
ances, including interviews on
Letterman, Conan, Kimmel,
Seth Meyers and "The Tonight
Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."
He's featured on the New York
Times Bestseller List and, just
this past year, played Patrick in
the much-beloved "The Fault in
Our Stars."
In August, Birbiglia even
secured a role on season three of
the hit Netflix show, "Orange Is
the New Black."
Yet he insists that the added
attention hasn't changed his
day-to-day life, especially his
interactions with strangers.
"A lot of times, I'll meet some-
one and they'll say 'You're a
comedian?' And I'll say, 'Yeah.'
And they'll say, 'You think
you're gonna make it?' And then
I'm like, 'Well, I think I already
have."' Tickets are still available,
so reach into your wallets, grab
your parents' credit card and
come on down to see a rising tal-
ent and one of the most unique
voices in comedy today.

He emerges from the TARDIS,
a little blue box we're all more
than familiar with ... but some-
thing's changed. Who is this bit-
ter old Scottish man with "attack
eyebrows" and a haggard face?
This isn't the Doctor we know and
love? Where's the fez and the flirt-
ing with companions? Where's
the wacky sense of wonder? What
happened to "Doctor Who?"
The answer is simple, brilliant
and found ina move that is really
making me miss Steven Moffat
already: "Doctor Who" got old.
Fifty to be precise, making him
the oldest science-fiction fran-
chise of all time - beating out
both "Star Trek" and "Star Wars."
For the first time in the series'
history, the actor and the show
itself are the same age. Actually,
Peter Capaldi, number thirteen of
the Doctors (but Malcolm Tucker
in the hearts of any fans of "The
Thick of It") is fifty-six but the
specificity isn't what's important
here.
Most of the time, the Doctor's
"regeneration" protocol is an easy
ploy (to those non-Whovians, the
Doctor never dies, but rather is
mortally injured and regenerates
himself to have a new physical
form; in other words, same guy,
different face). Oftentimes, the
executives of "Doctor Who" sim-
ply used it as a way for the show,
and character, to outlast the
actors. But now, it actually means
something: the Doctor, after fifty
years on screen, is finally showing
his age.
Not to say he's not the same
Doctor. The wit, wonder, genius
and personality is still all there.
But now, with Moffat almost done
with "Doctor Who," it seems
he's leaving his final dent in the

Bey's HBO takeover

By GRACE HAMILTON
Daily Arts Writer
What is it about Queen B that
commands the world's attention?
She's got the package no doubt;
beauty, poise, talent and charisma.
But there's something beyond the
average celebrity checklist that
has taken her to superhuman sta-
tus on a global scale, blowing away
audiences both up close and at a
distance.
This summer, Beyonce expand-
ed her reach even further into
daily life. On June 29th, "Beyon-
ce: X10" premiered on HBO, a
ten-episode series of four-minute
concert videos. The videos are all
from her most recent Mrs. Carter
Show World Tour. For those of
us who don't get the pleasure of
being there in person, the videos
can feel like a backstage pass. It's
striking to observe how even at the
most minute level, no detail goes
unplanned.
Several of the videos show the
faces of crying fans. I wouldn't pin
myself as a diehard fan; however, I
was surprised to find myself blown
away by her VMA performance.
The X10 videos are a little taste of
the same magic, the rising action to
her VMA climactic finish, which
caused Twitter to explode with
praise. Beyonce's concerts are a
spectacle. The dancers alone war-
rant a stage of their own. Her con-
fidence is a tight wrapping paper to
the little gift of each performance.
And we are equally wrapped up in
her. Shemakessure we can't forget
her when she leaves the stage, and
how could we anyway?
Beyoncd has become more
than an artist at this point. She is

HBO

Who wearing a bike helmet? Beyonce
a cultural icon, dominating social
media, fashion, news, lunch-break
discussions, and even politics. She
has grown into a symbol of any-
thing and everything pop culture.
Minus the important questions
regarding the feminist nature of
her work and general discourse
around female artists, Beyonc6
has left essentially zero room for
controversy or criticism in her
work. And should you have criti-
cisms and choose to make them
known, you would be faced with
a violent army of fans commit-
ted to showing you the error of
your ways. I made the mistake of
sharing with my coworkers that
"I didn't love 'Drunk in Love.'"
After being scolded, they directed
me to "The Beygency" SNL skit, in
which people expressing the same

ambivalence about the song are
punishedby a 1984- like, all know-
ing police. Whoops. Point being,
and jokes aside, to slander Beyonce
is an offense to most, such is her
standing in the world today.
The woman is a model of hard
work. In her last short episode,
her ethic comes through beyond
the glamour and the glitz: "Real-
ize the things that make you pas-
sionate, that you stay up for, that
you work for." I don't know about
you, but I'm still working on that
one. Watching someone get it right
might be where the tears come
from.
The X10 HBO series helps us
see why she's more than just the
package. Fortunately, or unfortu-
nately, I'm not sure if I can put it
into words.

position's loudness only makes
sense in relation to its quietest,
tenderest passages. Highlight-
ing that is the difficulty for any
ensemble setting out on such a
program as this one.
"I try to capture Beethoven's
relentless energy," Lipsky said
in describing his principal goal
in performing this titan of clas-
sical music.
"My biggest challenge in all of
these pieces is to find these beau-
tiful, endless, soft passages, and
to really bring them out," Lip-
sky discussed. "There are some
swatches oftriplepiano (dynamic
marking for soft playing), which
Beethoven usually shies away
from. He typically goes between
pianissimo and fortissimo, but
there are moments where he puts
not two, but the three 'p's.'"
Those who attend this event
will be in the expert hands of
Lipsky, Watts and the AASO's
musicians, as they experience
the play of ecstasy and calm,
triumph and solemnity, in these
celebrated compositions.

there has been a problem with
consistency in play.

Daley said. "Every game 'is
extremely difficult. There's a lot

By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS
For the Daily
As the Michigan women's soc-
cer teamopens the Big Ten season
this weekend against Minnesota
and No. 9 Wisconsin, the Wolver-
ines have revenge on their minds,
but it won't be easy.
Coming off a weekend with
two shutouts - 4-0 over Toledo
and 3-0 over Central Michigan
- that saw Michigan dominate
much of the possession and pace
of the match, the team is now
ready for its first conference
showdown of the year.
Minnesota, which comes to
town Friday, struggled the past
few years and should present an
even and competitive beginning
of conference play. The Golden
Gophers handed Michigan its
first Big Ten loss last season.

Appalachian State: This totally undefeated team.
made everyone forget about 2007,

right?
Notre Dame: We don't want to
talk about it.
Miami (Ohio): Michigan has
defeated the RedHawks in all five
of their meetings. The teams most
recently matched up in 2008 in
what was Rich Rodriguez's first
win as the Wolverines' coach.
Michigan struggled to put Miami
away until Brandon Minor ran
for the Wolverines' final score in
Michigan's 16-6 victory.
Utah: The Rich Rodriguez
era began against the Utes on
Aug. 30, 2008. That afternoon,
the Wolverines' new-look
spread offense struck first with
a touchdown, but Utah took a
15-point lead midway through the
third quarter and hung on, 25-23.
The close loss earned respect
later in the season as the Utes
beat Alabama in the Sugar Bowl
and finished as the country's only

Minnesota: It's the oldest
trophy game in FBS college
football, even if it's not very
competitive. The Wolverines and
Golden Gophers have fought for
the Little Brown Jug since 1909,
and Michiganholds a commanding
73-24-3 series lead. The jug was left
behind in Minnesota in 1903 after
the Gophers rallied for a late 6-6
tie. (Those were the only points
allowed by the Wolverines all year.)
The jug isn't little (it's a five-gallon
container) and originally was
white, not brown.
Rutgers: Despite boasting 280
years of college football between
them, the Scarlet Knights and
Wolverines have never met.
Rutgers hosted the first-ever
intercollegiate football game on
Nov. 6, 1869, against Princeton in
New Brunswick, New Jersey. The
Scarlet Knights won, 6-4, but lost
the rematch the following week.
Meanwhile, Michigan played its
first game 10 years later against

Racine in Chicago.
Penn State: Last season's
version of the matchup was a four-
overtime affair that tested the
health of everyone's heart. Now,
both teams return for another
matchup at night. This time, the
Wolverines take on a squad with
just11seniors and new coach James
Franklin replacing Bill O'Brien. In
the third year of their sanctions,
the Nittany Lions are playing with
fewer scholarship players where
the offensive line has taken one
of the biggest hits. Penn State has
time to adjust, though, and the
team that shows up now could be
different than the one starting the
season.
Michigan State: The rivalry for
the Paul Bunyan Trophy has tilted
in the Spartans' favor in recent
years. Michigan State has won
five out of the last six matchups
between the teams.
It could be difficultfor Michigan
to reverse the trend this year
playing at Spartan Stadium for the

second consecutive season.
Indiana: Little defense was
played in last year's meeting
between the teams when Michigan
beat the Hoosiers, 63-47 at the Big
House on Oct. 19. The Wolverines
will be coming off of two difficult
divisional games against Penn
State and Michigan State, so
avoiding a letdown could be key.
Northwestern: The Wildcats
seem to have had Michigan's
number the past few years. Three
years ago, the Wildcats held a lead
in Evanston before falling apart in
the fourth quarter.
Two years ago, the Wolverines
needed a late effort in the waning
minutes to force overtime and
pull out the win. This year, they
needed last-second field goal
to hang on for the win. All that
said, the Wildcats will be without
several key pieces, including
running back Venric Mark, and
should be less of a threat.
Plus, they reportedly used the
wrong wristbands against Cal.

Aren't they supposed to be smart?
Maryland: Welcome to the Big
Ten, Maryland. Like Michigan,
the Terrapins are looking to
rebound from a 7-6 season and
have a long road to do it. The
two teams will face off on the
tail end of Maryland's brutal six-
game stretch that includes Ohio
State, Wisconsin, Penn State and
Michigan State. The Terrapins
have sixth-year quarterback CJ
Brown leading the helm.
Ohio State: The Buckeyes
will be without star quarterback
Braxton Miller, but given that his
replacement will have a full season
to grow, Michigan should still see a
dominant team.
. Ohio State lacks Carlos Hyde
and its powerful run game and
also lacks skill at cornerback. Last
year's thriller, middle fingers and
broken foot behind them, this
year's game might be for bragging
rights only unless the Wolverines
and Buckeyes can rebound from
bad losses in Week 2.

'M' with a chance to rebound vs. Miami

Breakdown: 'M' superior at every position

By GREG GARNO
ManagingSports Editor
If the Michigan football team
ever needed an easy opponent, it
would be now.
And fortunately, they're getting
one of college football's easiest
foes when Miami (Ohio) heads to
Ann Arbor on Saturday for what
should be a chance not only to
build confidence, but also provide
a chance to give players added
experience before the Big Ten
schedule.
Miami is a welcome respite
following last weekend's 31-0
drubbing in South Bend. The
RedHawks haven't won in their
past 18 games, stretching back
to 2012, and having started the
season 0-2, Miami shows few
signs of improvement under new
coach Chuck Martin.
The RedHawks haven't played
in front of more than 100,000
fans since Sept. 1, 2012 at Ohio
State, which means Michigan (1-1)
should have an advantage before it
even snaps the ball.
"We have to go in there and
be aggressive and play from the
get-go," Martin said in the Mid-
American Conference coaches'
conference call. "Not be standing
around, looking at the Big House
and what a big place and (saying)
'Wow, this is a lot different than
we're used to.'
"Wehavetofocusonwhatwe're
trying to do. We've got to go out
and be aggressive and make plays
and not sit around and wait for
Michigan to make all the plays."
Butifthere is one thinggoingfor
the RedHawks, it's that they run a
similar offense to the one that gave
the Wolverines fits last weekend.
Martin, a former assistant
coach under Notre Dame's
Brian Kelly, has seen Michigan
for the last four years, and he's
implemented what he's learned.
Even his quarterback, Andrew
Hendrix, used to play at Notre
Dame before transferring.
Hendrix, who didn't see much
time at Notre Dame, gets the ball
out of his hands quickly, much
like Fighting Irish quarterback
Everett Golson did.
"They're throwing the ball
a ton, but he's pretty daggone
accurate," said Michigan coach
Brady Hoke. "You're going to see
a lot for quick throws. It reminds
me a little bit more of the offense
at Notre Dame with (former
quarterback Tommy) Rees."

But getting burned by that
offense last week should have the
Wolverines more prepared for it
this time around.
Miami will utilize six-man
protection schemes, often using
a tight end to compensate for a
weak offensive line, which should
theoretically allow Michigan's
defensive line to show it can
create pressure.
The Wolverines have yet to
record a turnover in two games,
which has kept the defense on the
fieldlonger and leftit more fatigued.
"They're one of the hardest-
playing football teams I've ever
really watched in my twenty-some
years of coaching, and they've
obviously got talent," Martin said.
"So we've got to a little bit throw
caution to the wind, a little bit go
in there and be aggressive and play
our game."
The RedHawks' game hasn't
been much to brag about now,
though. They fell to Marshall in
Week 1,-42-17, and turned the ball
over when they had chance to beat
Eastern Kentucky.
Hendrix is the predominant
ball carrier at Miami, though
that's not by design as much as it is
to avoid getting sacked. He rarely
has time to set up and wait for one
of his undersized wide receivers to
break free.
"Mainly we've got to improve
in ... negative plays, particularly
turnovers, particularly red zone
efficiency if we're going to give
ourselves a chance to win games,"
Martin said.
And if they somehow do find
success offensively, they'll still
haveto shutdown 6-foot-5receiver
Devin Funchess, who torched
Appalachian State for three
touchdowns in three quarters.
"I don't know that anyone
matches up in the country with
Funchess very well," Martin said.
"Too big for the DBs. Just physical
size-wise. Too athletic to put a
linebacker-type body on him. He's
a handful for anyone. You've just
got to fight and scratch and claw
and make him earn all the gains
he gets."
And they'll have to hope their
linebackers can bring down
bruising running backs Derrick
Green and De'Veon Smith, who
are just as big if not bigger.
So Michigan will get the easy
opponent that it so desperately
needs for a rebound. Whether it
can take advantage has yet to be
seen.

Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan football team
enters this weekend's game
against Miami (Ohio) needing
to get itself back on track after a
demoralizing loss at Notre Dame.
The Wolverines' offense,
defense and special teams looked
suspect in the program's first
shutout since 1984.
Luckily for Michigan (1-1); the
RedHawks (0-2) could present
the perfect antidote to heal what
ails the Wolverines. Miami has
lost 18 straight games, their last
victory coming Oct. 27, 2012.
Last week, the RedHawks fell to
FCS opponent Eastern Kentucky,
17-10.
Michigan will try to avoid
a similar fate to the one it
nearly suffered last year in
allowing another Mid-American
Conference member, Akron, to
stick around at the Big House
until a last-second stop salvaged a
28-24 victory.
Michigan pass offense vs.
Miami pass defense
Fifth-year senior quarterback
Devin Gardner endured his share
of struggles last week, throwing
three interceptions and losing a
fumble against the Fighting Irish.
But the RedHawks' secondary
and pass rush won't present the
challenge that Notre Dame's did.
Miami's pass defense has been
competent in its first two games,
but it hasn't faced a quarterback
the caliber of Gardner. Against
Eastern Kentucky, the RedHawks
surrendered 198 passing yards
while allowing just 14 of 28 passes
to be completed.
Still, Gardner should have
little trouble picking apart a MAC
opponent. The biggest question in
the Wolverines' passing game is
the health of junior wide receiver
Devin Funchess, who was injured
late against the Fighting Irish.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke has
declined to talk about injuries
this week.
Even if Funchess can't play,
the Wolverines should still
have enough other weapons to

Michigan rush offense vs.

The Wolverines' rush offense
earned mixed results against
Notre Dame. As a team, Michigan
ran for 100 yards, a sizeable
improvement over some of last
year's lackluster efforts. But
the running backs struggled to
produce consistently when the
game was still in reach.
Hoke suggested that his team
will use the same offensive line
as against the Fighting Irish,
providing an opportunity for the
unit to establish continuity going
forward.
In terms of stopping the run,
the RedHawks struggled in their
season opener against Marshall,
surrendering 171 yards. Last
week, Miami allowed 82 rushing
yards against Eastern Kentucky.
But again, the RedHawks
haven't faced an offensive line or
running backs like Michigan's.

schemes on multiple occasions.
As in the other areas of play,
Miami hasn't displayed a great

game.

Michigan through the lens of the NFL

Q&A: Miami beat writer Tom Downey

'M' has 38 draft
picks since 2004,
but many were
demoted or released
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan fans didn't need
to see Saturday's blowout loss
in South Bend to know the
Wolverines have been in decline
for the last six years.
But a struggle fans may not
have noticed is how few -
and how unsuccessful - the
program's draft picks have been,
in recent years, compared to
similar programs. One look at the
makeup of the National Football
League puts the struggles of the
nation's winningest program into
perspective.
Last Sunday, the 2014 NFL
season kicked off and LSU
had the most players on active
rosters, with 38. That number
will be bumped to 40 by week
two with Kansas City Chiefs wide
receiver Dwayne Bowe returning
from suspension and the Miami
Dolphins signing linebacker
Kelvin Sheppard. Behind the
Tigers, USC has 37 and Alabama
has 36. In all, SEC schools hold
four of the top five spots.
Despite having 38 draft picks
since 2004, Michigan has just 24
players on active rosters. Penn
State has had 40 draft picks
in that time. Notre Dame and
Wisconsin? Forty-five each. Ohio
State? Sixty-six. The Buckeyes
also lead the Big Ten in active
players with 29.
But of those 38 Michigan
picks, only 16 remain on teams.
An additional six undrafted
free agents have made their way
onto active rosters (and running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint just
signed to the Baltimore Ravens
practice squad). Legends Charles
Woodson and Tom Brady, far
removed from the Wolverines'
recent hardships, round out the
24.
In each year from2005 to 2008,
Michigan had a wide receiver
drafted who went on to have a
successful NFL career. In 2005,
the Browns took Braylon Edwards
with the third overall pick.
Jason Avant went in 2006 and is
currently playing for the Carolina
Panthers. Steve Breaston was

Managing Sports Editor
It's been more than a year and
a half - 18 games to be exact -
since Miami (Ohio) has won a
game. After a last-place finish
in 2013, the RedHawks could be
poised to fall to the cellar again.
And Tom Downey, Sports
Editor at The Miami Student, has
been following them since 2013.
The Daily spoke with Downey
to look ahead to the Michigan
football team's game on Saturday.
The Michigan Daily: Andrew
Hendrix and Miami utilize quick
passes in the offense, something
Michigan struggled with last
weekend in Notre Dame. Is the
offense effective at all with that
style of play and can he take
advantage of that passing style
this weekend?
Tom Downey: It's better
than last year, but last year's
was terrible, so that's not saying
too much. They've put up yards
and they're fourth in the NCAA
in time of possession, so they're
always keeping their defense off
the field. But they've struggled to
punch it in and score points.
And turnovers have killed
them. Especially against Eastern
Kentucky where they had six
turnovers and six false starts. The
mental mistakes are just killing
them.
TMD: As you watch the team
progress, are you seeing any
improvement in an offensive line
that struggles to protect long
enough, or is it much of the same?
TD: They haven't done a good
job of recruiting at the line. I
talked with coach Martin and
he said, "There is no depth at the
offensive line." It's one of those
things they have to put up with
and do as best they can for now.

was a fifth-round pick. His size
and arm issues forced a change of

Even at running back, he was
less than impactful his rookie

The jury's still out on "Shoelace."
Graham was selected in

Philadelphia Eagles and, overall,
has disappointed. Many expected
him to be released before this
season. Hart, a hero in Ann Arbor
under coach Lloyd Carr, lasted
just three years at the professional

level before finding success with a
clipboard on the sidelines.
Difference makers at skill
positions have been infrequent
as of late, and that has everything
to do with the numerous changes
instilled by Rodriguez and Hoke.
One look at the NFL is a big
step to understanding what's

press conference by with Chuck
Martin where he says they're
0-18. It's all about breaking that
streak, and Martin does not like
losing whatsoever.
TMD: Is Martin changing the
culture at Oxford then?
TD: He hasn't used the word,
but he's used the phrase, "how
we go about things." Under
(former coach) Don Treadwell I
don't think it was taken with the
seriousness that you see in other
programs.
The weight room was one area I
don't thinkthe players were forced
to go as often as they should have
been. Their routines - they didn't
go about them the right way. And
that was one of the first things
Martin was trying to change.
TMD: Alright, what's your
prediction for Saturday's game?

TD: Michigan's going to win,
that's for sure. I think by how
much depends on which Miami
offense shows up. As long as
Michigan shows up prepared and
focused, there won't be many
issues.
I'll say 38-17, Michigan.

TMD: How does that poor that
offensive line impact a running be a
game where the quarterback has Michigat
