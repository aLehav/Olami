At fireside chat,

Daily StaffReporter
Porch banisters strewn with
red Solo cups, dancing students
on the roof and beer bongs dan-
gling from third floor windows
are not uncommon sites for pass-

ersby walking to Michigan Sta-
dium on Football Saturdays.
While that scene occurs every
game day, E. Royster Harper,
the University's vice president
for student affairs, told students
yesterday that the behavior does
not accurately -reflect who Uni-
versity students are.
"I think there is quite a lot
of concern around getting to
the games healthy and safe and
sober," Harper said.
Harper expressed her sen-

timents about student safety
before footballigames at a fireside
chat with University President
Mary Sue Coleman and about 40
students in the Kuenzel Room of
the Michigan Union yesterday.
Harper addressed the issue in
response to a question from LSA
senior Sloane Wolf who asked
why it seems police are breaking
up Football Saturday pregame
parties more often this year than
they did in the past.

Daily editor beaten at civil rights protest

50 years ago this week
(Oct. 12,1961): Tom Hayden,
a former Michigan Daily edi-
tor in chief at the time, was
dragged from his car and
beatenwhile drivingby acivil
rights protest in McComb,
Miss.
About 100 students were
marching past the car after
walking out from Burgland
Negro High School because
the school wanted them to
sign forms pledging to not
participate in civil rights pro-
tests. The Associated Press
reported at the time that the
assailant was a local plumber.
Paul Potter, an officer of
the National Student Asso-

ciation, and Hayden were
driving to City Hall with a
police escort. But, ina Michi-
gan Daily article, Hayden
said police refused to protect
them and drove away as the
incident happened. ,.
Hayden said the chief of
police told him that the police
"couldn't protect outside agi-
tators, especially whites."
35 year ago this week
(Oct. 14, 1976): Univer-
sity Prof. James Harris
announced that he identified
the mummy of Queen Tiy.
Queen Tiy, the favorite
wife of Amenhotep III, lived
during the ancient eighteenth
Egyptian dynasty. A piece

of Tiy's hair - found in King
Tut's tomb - was critical to
identifying the mummy.
"(This is) the greatest
find since the discovery of
the tomb of King Tut-Ank-
Amon," Harris told the Daily
atthe time.
20 years ago this week
(Oct. 10, 1991): Sigma Kappa
sorority filed a lawsuit
against the city of Ann Arbor
after the Ann Arbor Plan-
ning Commission forbade the
sorority from adding an addi-
tion to its house.
The sorority applied for
a "special exception use"
permit, but the commission
declined the request after

hearing complaints from
local residents. MonikaSacks,
the sorority's attorney at the m
time, said Ann Arbor's zoning
restrictions were inherently
unfair for sororities and fra-
ternities.
"The city treats Greeks
quite differently from other
uses," she told the Daily at a
the time. "You could plop a
homeless shelter down in the
area without getting special
exception ... No matter where
(Greek houses) are, they're
required to get special excep-
tion use."

Suspected Taliban fighters
tortured in Afghan prisons

United Nations both international and Afghan

reports beatings,
electric shocks in
detention centers
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- Beatings, electric shocks and
other forms of torture were
administered to suspected Tali-
ban fighters in some Afghan-run
detention centers, the U.N. said
yesterday, even as the U.S. and
others have spent billions of dol-
lars training the police and secu-
rity services.
The abuse was not the result
of Afghan government policy, but
of individual actions that were
mostly ignored by the security
services, according to the 74-page
U.N. report.
Although Afghan security offi-
cials have long been suspected
of torturing detainees to elicit
information and confessions, the
report for the first time confirms
the practice and outlines much of
the abuse.
It found that detainees in 47
facilities in 24 provinces run by
the Afghan National Police and
the Directorate of Security suf-
fered interrogation techniques
that constituted torture under

law.
The NATO-led international
military coalition announced
last month that it had stopped
transferring detainees to 16 of
the facilities. NATO was taking
action to help fix the problem
before resumingthe transfers,the
report said.
International organizations
and governments have spent
years trying to bring good gover-
nance and rule of law to Afghani-
stan, a goal that has taken added
significance following a decision
to hand over security responsi-
bilities to the Afghan government
by the end of 2014 - when all for-
eign combat troops are to leave
the country.
According to the U.N. report,
the torture allegations could
under U.S. law endanger Ameri-
can funding to some of security
services. The U.S. provides the
overwhelming majority of the
cash currently flowing into train-
ing and mentoring programs.
It said the torture allegations
"could also trigger application" of
a 1997 law that bars the U.S. gov-
ernment from providing funding,
weapons or training to any unit of
the security forces of a country if
the U.S. secretary of state deter-
mines there is credible evidence

that it "has committed gross
human rights violations."
The law would not be applied,
however, if the U.S. determined
that action was being taken to
solve the problem.
One such step, it said, would
include bringing tojustice "those
officials responsible for torture
and ill-treatment"
The U.N. said Afghan secu-
rity ministries cooperated with
the investigation and have taken
measures to stop the abuse after
being shown the report. They
have opened investigations, reas-
signed personnel and have indi-
cated that those responsible will
be suspended from their positions
and in serious cases, prosecuted.
Drafted by the U.N.'s Afghan
mission, known as UNAMA, the
report was based on interviews
with 379 detainees from October
2010 to August 2011.
Most of the detainees were
"suspected of being Taliban fight-
ers, suicide attack facilitators,
producers of improvised explo-
sive devices, and others implicat-
ed in crimes associated with the
armed conflict in Afghanistan."
Torture methods included sus-
pending people by their wrists,
beating the soles of the feet, elec-
tric shocks, twisting detainees'
genitals and removing toe nails.

Egyptian
Americans honor
slain Coptic
Christians
DETROIT (AP) - Egyptian
Christians living in the U.S. said
yesterday that they are horri-
fied by violence that has erupted
against Copts back home, includ-
ing a deadly assault on those try-
ing to stage a peaceful protest in
Cairo in response to an attack on
a church.
Coptic Christians in Michigan
and California were among those
heeding the call of their spiritual
leader, Pope Shenouda III, to
participate in a three-day period
of mourning starting today for
the victims of the worst sectar-
ian violence in Egypt since the
uprising that ousted President
Hosni Mubarak in February. The
death toll yesterday after a night
of rioting rose to 26, and most
were Copts.
"We're not looking for any
revenge; we're looking for peace
in Cairo and Egypt and every-

where in the world," said the Rev.
Maximus Habib of St. Mark Cop-
tic Orthodox Church and the St.
Mary & St. Philopater Church in
the Detroit suburb of Troy. Com-
bined, the congregations serve
about 600 families.
Habib said a close friend of his
brother was among the dead.
Despite his pleas for peace,
anger was evident among mem-
bers of the U.S. expatriate com-
munity of Copts, who number
about 300,000. The largest con-
centrations include communi-
ties in New York and northern
New Jersey, Boston, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Detroit, Houston and
Cleveland.
The clashes Sunday night
raged over a large section of
downtown Cairo and drew in
Christians, Muslims and secu-
rity forces. They began when
about 1,000 Christian protesters
tried to stage a peaceful sit-in
outside the state television build-
ing along the Nile in downtown
Cairo. The protesters said they
were attacked by "thugs" with
sticks and the violence then spi-
raled out of control after a speed-
ing military vehicle jumped up

onto a sidewalk and rammed into
some of the Christians.
Christians, who make up
about 10 percent of Egypt's 85
million people, blame the ruling
military council that took power
after the uprising for being too
lenient on those behind a spate
of anti-Christian attacks since
Mubarak's ouster.
Saad Michael Saad, an electri-
cal engineer who lives in Palos
Verdes, Calif., arrived in the U.S.
in 1977 and still has family in
Alexandria and Cairo. Saad, 66,
has written hundreds of articles
about contemporary Coptic his-
tory.
He said his relatives are terri-
fied by the violence against the
Coptic Christians.
"The thugs stop people on
bridges and bottlenecks and they
ask the person, 'Are you Chris-
tian?' If they are Christian, they
smash his windshield and injure
him," Saad said. "Even when
they stay home, my relatives are
saying there are mobs running
around the streets and invading
homes, occupying empty apart-
ments. There is no law in the
land."

Christopher Sims and Thomas
Sargent have no simple solutions
to the global economic crisis. But
the work that wonthem the Nobel
Prize in economics yesterday

policymakers in their search for
answers.
The two Americans, both 68,
were honored for their research
in the 1970s and'80s on the cause-
and-effect relationship between
the economy and government
policy.

Sims is a professor at Princeton
University. Sargent teaches at
New York University and is a vis-
iting professor at Princeton.
Among their achievements,
tie two Nobel laureates - work-
ing separately for the most part
over the years - devised tools to

"This year, (it has) gotten to
the point where (the police) are
taking groups of people, no mat-
ter if they're 21 or not, and forc-
ing them to leave houses," Wolf
said. "So it just has students scat-
tering everywhere and kind of
taking away the spirit, I think,
for the pregame - especially
when the University is doing so
well in the sport."
Coleman directed the ques-
tion to Harper, who said there
has been an increase in heavy
drinking on Saturday mornings,
so the police are tryingto control
the behavior.
"I think the intent (of the
increased presence) is to tone
it down, to get everybody more
conscious and to not have it
begin so early," Harper said.
The attendees also addressed
campus safety at the fireside
chat - a periodic event in which
Coleman invites a small number
of students to talk with her in a
personal setting about any cam-
pus topic or concern.
Dean of Students Laura
Blake Jones also attended and,
explained new safety measures
being implemented this year like
the Beyond the Diag program -
a new effort to unite students in
off-campus residential to help
increase safety awareness. Jones
said there are plans to expand
Beyond the Diag into several
neighborhoods surrounding

campus and to improve late night
transportation.
At the chat, Coleman also dis-
cussed how to increase minor-
ity enrollment at the University.

and is working to keep enroll-
ment rates of minority students
high, she said. However, the
task became more difficult when
Michigan voters banned affir-
mative action in 2006, Coleman
said. As a result, the University
had to amp up its recruitment
efforts.
"When the state, against my
better judgment, changed the
constitution to restrict our abil-
ity to use affirmative action
in admissions, then we really
kicked into gear even more of the
programs we've been doing tra-
ditionally," Coleman said. "The
good news is that every year our
applications for underrepresent-
ed minorities has gone up."
Last year's freshman classwas
composed of 10.6 percent under-
represented minority students -
a 1.5-percent increase from the
2009-2010 freshman class.
To Coleman, the most impor-
tant aspect of increasing minor-
ity enrollment is to improve
matriculation rates after admit-
tance. She said the University
is making greater efforts to
encourage students to choose to
attend the University after being
admitted.
"We win some, we lose some,
but we need to keep at it because
it's very important," Coleman
said.

Nau said University buses
traveling between North and
Central campuses are a sig-
nificant part of the traffic on
Fuller Road. The corridor has
a substantial amount of traffic
because it includes what Nau
called "key places" in Ann Arbor
like the University Hospital.
Buses run frequently along
that route - on average, one bus
every two to three minutes - and
have more than 30,700 riders per

SUSTAINABILITY
From Page 1
(that) Mary Sue Coleman kicked
off this initiative and focused us
on education research and oper-
ations and engagement across
the board in sustainability," Sca-
via said.
Scavia discussed the Univer-
sity's plan to work with DTE to
install solar panel fields on North
Campus to increase energy effi-
ciency. The University has also
adopted Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design certi-
fication for all new construction
sites on campus.
Additionally, the University
aims to have 20 percent of the
food it purchases come from
sustainable sources - defined by
the University as food produced
within 250 miles of the campus
- by 2025.
However, SACUA member
Rachel Goldman, a professor of
engineering and physics, said the
issue of food packaging is still
ignored on campus. She asked if
packaging would have to be man-
ufactured inthe United States to

be considered sustainable - a
question to which Scavia did not
have an answer.
"I think the packaging is prob-
ably more harmful to the envi-
ronment than the food itself,"
Goldman said.
Two years ago, the Univer-
sity launched a course called
Sustainability on Campus that
involves the development of sus-
tainability initiatives on campus.
Students in the class worked on
projects such as implementing
trayless dining in the residence
halls, creating a garden on cam-
pus and producing a pamphlet
called "How to Be a Green Wol-
verine," which is sent to incom-
ing freshmen, according to
Scavia. The University plans to
instate a trayless policy in new
and updated dining halls, as part
of the sustainability goals.
Besides introducing sustain-
ability in course, Scavia said
the University's sustainability
efforts are also shown in its aca-
demic offerings. Of the roughly
640 courses offered at the Uni-
versity, about 200 of them are
directly related to sustainability
or focus on issues that pertain to
sustainability. To get even more

students involved in the efforts,
the College of Literature, Science
and the Arts introduced a minor
in sustainability this year.
Planet Blue's efforts have
saved 12 percent in energy sav-
ings in 68 campus buildings,
which equates to $4 million and
13,000 tons of carbon dioxide,
according to Scavia.
The University's long-term
goal is to reach carbon neutral-
ity, though it is unclear when
that can be achieved, Scavia said.
Meanwhile, the University is
striving to reduce its greenhouse
gas emissions by 25 percent and
reduce its waste tonnage by 40
percent in the next 14 years.
SACUA member Ed Rothman,
a professor of statistics, sug-
gested that technologies should
play alarger role in sustainability
efforts on campus. He gave the
examples of software that shuts
off inactive machines and sen-
sors that turn lights off when an
area is not in use.
"There are opportunities for
us to find ways of facilitating sus-
tainability by developing tech-
nologies that would make these
things work better for everyone,"
Rothman said.

Invest in innovation
New initiative is beneficial to 'U' and community
University President Mary Sue Coleman has been in a giving
mood lately. A week after outlining a $14 million plan to fund
sustainability projects on campus, Coleman announced that
the University will implement another initiative - direct investment
in start-ups created by University faculty members. Investing in on-
campus start-ups demonstrates the University's economic and moral
support for its employees, and the project should be expanded to all
members of the University community.

Before I get to the spectacle
that was the two daylong
abortion-is-genocide extrav-°
aganza held on
the Diag last
week, let's talk
about the impot-
tance of the
words we choose.
The word lp
"genocide" is a
relatively recent
construct, draw- DANIEL
ing from the CHARDELL
Greek genos for
"race, kind" and
the Latin -cide for "killer."
We owe many thanks to a man
named Raphael Lemkin for coining
this term and, more importantly, for
his pioneering advocacy of interna-
tional legislation to address and pre-
vent it. As a Polish Jew and scholar
of international law, Lemkin's stud-
ies assumed much more personal
significance when he witnessed
Hitler invade Poland, demonize his
religion and murder his family on
the grounds of a twisted theory of
racial superiority.
Surviving World War II, Lem-
kin emerged as a leading proponent
of a legally binding international
agreement prohibiting genocide.
In 1948 the nascent United Nations
unanimously adopted the landmark
Convention for the Prevention and
Punishment of the Crime of Geno-
cide - the product of Lemkin's activ-
ism and a triumph for untold millions
of victims.
Labeling abortion "genocide" is
wrong. That's not my opinion - it's
etymological fact. Lemkin arrived at
the term genocide precisely because
its roots, genos and -cide, capture the
nature of the events that he sought to
illustrate: the purposeful extermina-
tion of an ethnic group. In Lemkin's
lifetime, this meant Armenians and
Jews. Over the next several decades,
that list of victims would tragically
come to include Muslims in Bosnia,
Tutsis in Rwanda, East Timorese
under Indonesian occupation and
other groups victimized for their
shared heritage, common social iden-
tity orexpressed beliefs. Sorry, but

fetuses don't qualify.
The pro-life supporters on the
Diag were only aware of the histori-
cal implications of the word "geno-
cide" in the most superficial and
distorted ways. I say this not as a lib-
eral (which Iam) who disagrees with
their extreme political stance (which
I do), but as someone who stood on
the Diag for nearly two hours speak-
ing with the event's organizers as I
tried to figure out how they could
possibly justify equating abortion
with Nazism.
Needless to say,' I wasn't con-
vinced.
After telling the activists on the
Diag that I'm Jewish, I asked if my
being pro-choice meant that I'm the
contemporary equivalent of a Nazi.
"No," they said, "of course not!"
Why, then, were there pictures of
aborted- fetuses placed alongside
photographs of emaciated Jews?
Why was there a swastika strategi-
cally placed at the top of a sign read-
ing, "Can you connect the dots?"
Why, Students for Life, was this
sensationalist scare tactic the best
way to convey your pro-life mes-
sage? Suggesting that your peers are
complicit in genocide isn't exactly
the best way to start what Michi-
gan Daily columnist Harsha Nahata
aptly calls "meaningful debates."
Last week's display was anything
but meaningful. It was insulting -
no matter how you spin it.
Carmen Allen, president of Stu-
dents for Life, defends her organiza-
tion's decision to bring the Genocide
Awareness Project to campus by
claiming that students at the Univer-
sity are apathetic toward the issue of
abortion. That's avalid point.
But you know what else student's
are apathetic about? The socioeco-
nomic inequalities and campaigns of
misinformation that exacerbate the
number of unwanted pregnancies in
the United States. One of the repre-
sentatives from the Genocide Aware-
ness Project tried to convince me
that abstinence should be taught as
the best way to minimize unwanted
pregnancies. If teenagers didn't have
hormones, that might be true. But
let's takes look atthe facts.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry champi-
ons abstinence-only sex education.
According to a 2009 study issued
by the Texas Freedom Network, 94
percent of Texas school districts
give students no sex education
beyond abstinence. How well has
abstinence-only sex ed worked? The
Guttmacher Institute reported in
2010 that Texas has the highest teen
birth rate and the fourth-highest
teen pregnancy rate in the country.
Clearly, Mr. Perry, the young people
of Texas aren't buying it.
Don't sacrifice
decency for
shock value.
This matters. Let's get at the
source of the problem - unwanted
pregnancies. UnfortunatelyStudents
for Life doesn't seem to understand
that abortion is the consequence of
a much larger societal issue - one
that's perpetuated by extreme right-
wing politicians who are all too eager
to pander to their base and unjustifi-
ably defund Planned Parenthood. (By
the way, only 3 percent of Planned
Parenthood's services are abortion-
related.) Rather than draw attention
to underlying social issues and the
failures of abstinence-only sex ed,
Students for Life has resorted to an
easier approach: calling anyone with
whom they disagree a Nazi.
Students for Life, you're contrib-
uting directly to the erosion of our
discourse (and your own credibility)
by giving a platform to a reactionary,
fear-mongering, historically insensi-
tive group that's willing to exploit
and cheapen genocide for the sake
of its own highly politicized cause.
You're free to invite whoever you'd
like to campus. That's a right to
which you're entitled. But don't sac-
rifice decency for shock value.

Through an initiative called the Michigan
Investment in New Technology Startups -
referred to as MINTS - the University could
invest up to $500,000 in any start-up formed
by a faculty member. To be eligible for fund-
ing, a project must first receive funding from
an independent venture capital firm. Over
the next decade, the University projects that
it could award up to $25 million through the
initiative.
The plan perpetuates the University's status
as a leader in innovation. In the last fiscal year,
University faculty filed 122 patents and 101
licenses. Faculty have also launched about 10
companies a year in the past decade.
Similar to other investments, the University
will obtain a monetary return once a company
becomes profitable. But unlike other invest-
ments, the University is entitled to say it is
home to innovative and successful research-
ers, and it played an active role in helping these
individuals succeed. Inventors and entrepre-
neurs make an important decision about their
professional careers when they decide to work
at the University, and this initiative indicates
that work is appreciated.
Universities often invest in the most profit-
able ventures, many of which are not campus-
grown or even in the university's home state.
Money for MINTS is coming from the Uni-
versity's endowment. However, it is money
that is being reallocated to help "(diversify)

our assets," according to Coleman. Though
there is no guarantee all the start-ups the
University invests in will generate revenue,
it's necessary the University demonstrates its
support for its community.
Some universities have received large
returns from profitable, campus-grown com-
panies without directly investing in them.
However, these universities tend to be locat-
ed near places like California's Silicon valley
and Boston's Route 128, where lucrative firms
invest in local start-ups. Working in a city that
isn't flourishing financially makes it more dif-
ficult for start-ups to get off the ground.
Given Ann Arbor's geographic location and
Michigan's slow recovery from the recent
economic downturn, start-ups at the Uni-
versity may have difficulty finding investors.
It's imperative the University lends a hand.
Should these start-ups become profitable, they
will likely keep and attract talent in the state,
hire local workers and contribute to Michi-
gan's economy.
However, faculty members aren't the only
people on campus executing new and creative
concepts. When the University begins to see
returns on this investment, Coleman must
carry out her proposal to offer funding to stu-
dent start-ups as well. The University's plan
to grant funds to start-ups is a great way to
encourage new ideas and local investment, and
it should continue to expand this initiative.

VANESSA RYCHLINSKI I
Protect historical houses

Occupy Wall St. is raising hell

When I worked as a canvasser for a non-
profit two summers ago, I was assigned a
neighborhood in Ann Arbor's historic Old
West Side. Traversing on foot to make cold
calls at strangers' doors was often a trying
task. I was thankful, however, that I wasn't
stuck in typical suburbia - I was consistently
amazed at the variety of the houses and the
creativity of their owners.
In September 2009, the Ann Arbor City
Council approved City Place, a project that
would demolish seven century-old houses on S.
Fifth Street to make way for a set of two-block
apartment buildings containing24 units, com-
plete with a 36 space surface parking lot. The
proposal was in line with city regulations and
a refusal from City Council could've resulted
in a lawsuit.
Knowing the unpopularity of his project,
developer Alex de Parry tried to compromise
later in that same year by bringing forward a
new venture for the same area called Heritage
Row. Heritage Row not only kept the seven
houses intact by building the apartments
behind them, it also created a sub-surface
parkinggarage with a public art display. When
the choice was presented before the council,
the Germantown Neighborhood Association
- Germantown is an area south of Main Street
and includes the row of houses in question -
brought forth a petition that forced the need
for a super-majority to approve the project.
The project was subsequently turned down
- blocked by four City Council members. In
July 2010, in a last-ditch attempt to stop all
construction on the strip of houses along Fifth
Street, City Council voted to designate the
area as historic and therefore protected. The
vote failed.
Now that City Place is apparently moving
forward, the tenants of the seven houses along
Fifth Street were told on July 15 that they had
until the end of September to vacate the prem-
ises. Many of these residents are University
students. While some tenants had a clause in
their housing contracts stating their leases
may unexpectedly expire, others did not.
While some students have complied, others
insist that they were not informed - either
verbally or in their lease contract - they must
vacate. One student told me that though her
landlord told her to be out as soon as possible,
there was no way she was leaving without

proper compensation.
It's hard to look at this situation and refrain
from playing the blame game. The inimi-
cal relationship between a developer and
Ann Arbor city officials has put a century-
old streetscape under serious threat of being
destroyed. Ann Arbor residents, University
students included, are being displaced unfairly,
and in the first quarter of the school year to
make matters worse. This is a serious situation,
and it clearly didn't happen overnight. I could
point a finger at Alex de Parry and Jeff Helmin-
ski, owner of Campus village LLC of Rochester
and a partner in the project, for attempting to
build City Place. But developers have always
been destroying history to turn a profit, and
de Parry spent years trying to move forward
with Heritage Row. He even complied with city
council members' and Germantown Neighbor-
hood Association members' requests to modify
his building plans.
In the end, something very unfortunate
occurred amid the swirl of politics and proce-
dure. Certain council members decided to call
de Parry's bluff - Mike Anglin (D-Ward 5), one
of the four who blocked the Heritage Row pro-
posal, stated in September to AnnArbor.com
that developers "had that option to build City
Place,.but I don't think that's their intent." Ste-
phen Kunselman (D-Ward 3), another council
member who voted down Heritage Row, placed
the blame on the council: "The council chose
not to create a historic district to protect those
houses and they have said basically that those
houses aren't worth protecting." Kunselman
continues, saying, "the burden is on the prop-
erty owner" to "do what's right." I attempted
to contact the president of the Germantown
Neighborhood Association, who simply gave
me the name of another member. An attempt to
reach this member yielded a fullvoice mailbox.
One of the things that I love most about Ann
Arbor is its character. This city is not your typi-
cal college town, and that's something you can
see by taking a walk in any direction. Is there a
need for more student housing? From looking
at this year's freshman class, I'd say probably.
But are the Zaragon Twos and the City Places
necessarily the right answer? Probably not.
And definitely not if they come at the expense
of residents or the culture of this city.

n Aug. 27, 1963, a Gal-
lup poll revealed that
Americans disapproved

of the March
on Washington
- which took
place the next
day - at a ratio
of 3 to 1. Many
simply thought
the civil rights
leaders were
demanding too
much. Others
sympathized
with the move-

ment but did not approve of their
methods.
Lately, I've encountered simi-
lar views in regard to Occupy Wall
Street - the recent set of anti-cor-
porate protests in New York's Finan-
cial District. Many think all the
protesters are nuts or that blocking
traffic in front of corporate offices
holds no purpose. But to be frank, it
doesn't matter all that much when
the public disapproves of a massive
demonstration such as the March on
Washington or Occupy Wall Street.
The pointis to raise hell, and Occupy
Wall Street is doing exactly that.
Granted, when I first read about
the movement, I was very skeptical
of its prospects. But it's been three
weeks, and Occupy Wall Street has
hardly died out - last week it held
its largest demonstration yet. With
every new headline of a police crack-
down on protesters, I wonder if this
is going to mark an important turn-
ing point for corporate politics. I
sure as hell hope so.
While it's too early in the game to
tell what the protests will amount to,
these are the plotlines I'll be looking
to follow as it proceeds:,
How will Occupy Wall Street-
organize its agenda?
Probably the most common criti-
cism of Occupy Wall Street so far is

that it has no central focus. As The
New York Times puts it, you may
ask 10 protesters about the goals of
the movement and get 10 different
answers. One slideshow from The
Atlantic showed protest signs that
were all over the place in terms of
policy - while some are fighting
for higher wages or reforms to stu-
dent loans, others are demanding
that we end capitalism or encourage
anarchy.
While these observations are cor-
rect, anyone who thinks that the
movement needs to have a clear set
of policy goals can shove it. Even if
the current goals are broad, diverse,
and sometimes contrasting, it's
abundantly clear where the common
thread lies. Our current economic
and political dogma causes tre-
mendously unequal outcomes, and
Americans are suffering because of
it. For this reason, the movement's
current slogan, "We are the 99 per-
cent" will go a long way. Still, the
question remains if a group of lead-
ers will emerge from the pack and
deal with the necessary political
hurdles to make definitive policy
changes.
'How much disruption can it
cause?
On Friday, New York Mayor
Michael Bloomberg warned protest-
ers that they were antagonizing the
companies that could hire them, and
therefore, they were only hurting
the economy further. But this state-
ment misses the point.
Protesters want bigger changes
than renewed business confidence
leading to increased hiring. And to
get those changes, they need bar-
gaining leverage obtained through
public disruption. If the disruption
means business confidence remains
low in the near term, so be it.
Such strategies could likely help
other occupy, groups across the
country, such as Occupy Ann Arbor,

since holding an evening meeting in
the Diag didn't cause much of a stir.
Tea Party counterweight?
Even before last year's midterm
elections, it seemed like Republi-
cans, and especially the Tea Party,
had been calling the shots in Wash-
ington. But, as many have already
pointed out, Occupy Wall Street
feels like the Tea Party of the left.
In the short term; there's some hope
that this movement can re-energize
the Democrats' liberal base. Con-
gressional Democrats like House
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have
already shown their support.
The movement's
'99 percent' will
go a long way.
In, the long run though, I
hope Occupy Wall Street can do
more. We live in a post-Reagan
political realm in which even the
Democratic presidents hedge on
conservative economic policies.
Long gone is the liberal golden
age of the 50s and 60s. I realize
this is a long shot, but ultimate-
ly, I want Occupy Wall Street to
,,succee d so liberalism can once
again be a contending force in
American politics.
Occupy Wall Street's future
is uncertain, but this statement
from former Wisconsin Demo-
cratic Sen. Russ Feingbld sums
up the outcome I'm hoping for,
"By the time this is over, it will
make the Tea Party look like ... a

Council approves program
to green commercial areas

PACE program to
decrease energy
costs for properties
By JENNIFER LEE
Daily StaffReporter
In the city known for its trees, a
new program is aiming to encour-
age commercial properties to be a
little bit greener.
The program, the Property
Assessed Clean Energy program,'
will limitAnnArbor's greenhouse
gas emissions by urging commer-
cial property owners to install
more energy-efficient infrastruc-
ture. The Ann Arbor City Council
approved the PACE program at its
meetinglast week.
PACE is a statewide initiative
passed last' December that local
governments have the option of
implementing. It is estimated that
the PACE program will enable
$26 million per year to remain in
the city's economy, according to
an Oct. 4 City of Ann Arbor press
release.
Through the program, com-
mercial property owners can
apply for an assessment to deter-
mine the feasibility of installing
energy-efficient systems in their
buildings. The possible energy
M improvements - costing between

$1,000 to $350,000 - include
geothermal systems, Energy Star
appliances, solar panels, efficient
heating and cooling systems and
improved insulation.
The projects are financed
through the city's revenue bonds
and offer property owners lower
operating costs and several eco-
nomic incentives such as fixed
interest rates and an extended
repayment period. The program
will only carry out plans for a proj-
ect that will yield greater energy
savings than costs, accordingto
the Ann Arbor City Council web-
site.
Ann Arbor resident Conan
Smith, a member of the Washt-
enaw County Board of Commis-
sioners, voiced his appreciation
for the PACE program during
the public hearing portion of last
week's City Council meeting.
Advocating for sustainable solu-
tions to improve the economy,
Smith said the PACE program will
create valuable opportunities for
businesses.
"When we look at economic
development into the future, the
green economy is going to be a
critical component of that," Smith
said. "And making sure that our
businesses have a means to par-
ticipate in it is going to be equally
important for us."
Wendy Barrott, the city's com-

munity energy coordinator and
an employee of the Ann Arbor-
based non-profit Clean Energy
Coalition, said the PACE program
is using voluntary assessments
because energy efficiency is con-
sidered a public good.
"Cities and townships have the
authority to levy assessments o'n
purchases of property to imple-
ment projects that are for public
good," Barrott said. "They've been
used, historically, for sidewalks,
sewer disconnects, storm sewer
disconnects and a wide variety of
projects like that."
At last week's City Council
meeting, Smith said the Washt-
enaw County Board of Commis-
sioners might follow the city's lead
and create a county wide program.
He said implementing a similar
program at the county level would
give commercial properties in
smaller towns the opportunity to
increase their energy efficiency.
"In Ann Arbor, we have a den-
sity of commercial property that
makes a program like this viable
at the city level," Smith said. "But
when you look at some of our
smaller townships, for example,
they aren't going to have that kind
of population, so they're never
going to be able to offer the bonds
that would finance a program like
this or qualify for granting from
the federal government."

BOARD TO REVIEW
PROPOSED ADDITION TO

Slottow and Ora Pescovitz,
the University's executive vice
president for medical affairs,
requested the regents' approval
to fund a project to accommo-
date the University's second
cardiac catheterization labora-
tory for pediatric cases.
The project, estimated to cost
$3.45 million, proposes to house
the laboratory in the approxi-

on the 11th floor of the new C.S.
Mott Children's and Von Voigt-

hospitals are scheduled to offi-

If approved, the project is
expected to be completed in
fall 2012. Funding would come
from the University of Michi-

Bringing it to Broadway

MT&D student
Taylor Louderman
takes to the stage
By DHRUV MADEKA
For the Daily
Even if she's humming a tune
under her breath on a crowded
New York subway, Taylor Loud-
erman is easily distinguishable
from the masses. Graced with a
Broadway-bound voice, Loud-
erman isn't an everyday social
encounter.
Louderman, a musical theatre
major in the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance, is currently
residing in New York City, spend-
ing a year away from the Uni-
versity to perform in a national
tour of "Bring It On: The Musi-
cal." Based on the hit-movie
series of the same name, "Bring
It On" plans to tour the country,
going through 12 cities until June
before attempting to make a run
on Broadway.
After playing her first role as
Annie in "Annie: The Musical,"-at
age 10, Louderman took a deeper
interest in the arts as she grew
older. She took part as a teen in
the Muny, St. Louis's well-known
outdoor theater, and finally audi-
tioned for six schools during her
senior year of high school before
deciding to attend Michigan.
The musical theatre program
at the University is considered
one of the most prestigious of its
kind. Notoriously difficult to get
into - Louderman believes in
her year there were 800 people
who auditioned and 20 who were
admitted - the program usually
houses the creme de la creme of
the country's musical talent.
Louderman spoke about the
University's virtues, citing both
its "big college experience" and
its h -qua,1y faculty.

CHRIS DZOMBAK/Daily
Would-be MT&D junior Taylor Lauderman played Princess Amneris in MUSKET's production of "Aida" last November.

"It doesn't get any better," she
said. "They really focus on mak-
ing ita family-oriented program."
Louderman's vocal talents
have allowed her to take on a
range of roles. Most notably, she
played the Princess Amneris last
November in MUSKET's "Aida."
But even outside of the Universi-
ty, she has undertaken a number
of roles in the Muny, including
"Beauty and the Beast" and
"Footloose." In fact, she spent the
early summer playing Margot in
the Muny's adaptation of "Legal-
ly Blonde, The Musical," before
she dropped out of the next play
to begin her journey with "Bring
it On."
Despite her success, Louder-
man remains overwhelmed by
the position she is in and the
people she is now surrounded by.
And rightfully so, since the musi-
cal, loosely based on the third and

fourth movies of the "Bring it On"
series, features a Tony and Gram-
my Award-winning staff.
"There are days when I'm
like - oh my gosh, I am going
into this room with these Tony
Award-winning people and I'm
aboutto do this tour," Louderman
said. "Had this never happened, I
would be back at school with my
classmates.
"And I constantly go back and
forth, but honestly, you just put
your mind to what you need to do
and all that goes away."
Despite the ubiquitous nature
of the "Bring it On" franchise,
Louderman believes the musical
has more to offer than any of the
movies. She puts herself through
taxing rehearsals to prepare for
a role she believes requires the
physical endurance of an ath-
lete. The musical, which is based
in the cheerleading world, will

feature stunts that Louderman
promises will leave the audience
amazed.
"I don't think I've ever seen a
musical with this much wowing
going on," she said. "It's some-
thing I never imagined I would
have to do."
Louderman understands
why people might find musicals
cheesy: When they aren't done
well, they don't seem to contrib-
ute thuch to one's cerebral needs.
But she also acknowledges that a
well-done musical has the power
to leave an indelible mark on its
audience.
"Every time I leave a show, I
feel different - I feel changed,"
Louderman said. "I think music.
is kind of a universal language. It
can move you without you really
even knowing, or without you
realizing that's what it's trying
to do."

'app album.'
The album's opener is a
paradigm of the. deceptive
minimalism of the album's
melodies. Aptly named "Cos-
mogony," the song begins
with Bjork speculating about
the origin of the universe.
Her proposed explanations
are admittedly lame -' an
empty sea, a cold black egg, a
silver fox. She even mentions
the Big Bang - say, that's
not innovative at all! Bjork
attempts to comment on par-
ticularly mind-blowing topics
like the genesis of life, but the
simplicity of her lyrics verge
on triteness. Thankfully, the
raw aesthetics of the song
make up 'or any lack of awe-
inspiring cogitation. An ethe-
real chorus opens the song,
later accompanying musings
about Heaven: The song ends
in an echoing deterioration
that is absolutely otherworld-
ly, even by Bjork's standards.
"Crystalline" hops along
with a series of pings created
from a computer-generated
hybrid instrument called a
"gameleste," eventually con-
cluding with a frenzied bar-
rage of glitches with a beat
that bears a strange resem-
blance to Aphex Twin. The
final track, "Virus," begins
with an invitingly mysteri-
ous xylophone-like tune that
prefaces a poetic catalogue
of metaphors on parasites.
Intermingled throughout
these comparisons, Bjork
oohs softly, creating a sway-
worthy melody. Both of these
are singles from the album,
unsurprising given they have
distinct melodies more likely
to appeal to the public. An
iPad app and extensive back-
ground knowledge aren't nec-
essary to enjoy (and maybe
even dance to) "Crystalline."

Globetrotting with Beirut
Bassist discusses travel and group's rise
from one-computer band to indie stardom

appearances in
Spin Magazine, Bei
the members
of Beirut have Royal Oak

lowing the
August release of their third
album, The Rip Tide, the band-
mates are moving across con-
tinents yet again. They will be
lighting up Royal Oak tonight
with new music and inspira-
tion, but the same European folk
sound that started the frenzy five
years ago.
But it hasn't always been con-
certs and magazine shoots for Bei-
rut. Their story is a music industry
Cinderella story, beginning in
2006 when the band released
its, first album, Gulag Orkestar.
Before then the music could only
be heard in a University of New
Mexico bedroom, where singer
Zach Condon wrote and recorded
songsaby himself.
"The first, time I actually saw
(Condon) play, it was him with
his laptop and a trumpet," said
Beirut's bassist Paul Collins.
"He's come a long way from there.
It's a far more alive endeavor,


as opposed to him playing MP3
backingtracks alone."
It didn't take long for Condon to
form a band with six of his friends,
who used their humble, comput-
er-based origins as a launching
pointto perform in public.
"We were lucky to have the
Internet on our side," Collins said.
"We were immediately playing
shows for people who were famil-
iar with our music. Suddenly, we
had an international following.
That's different from any other
band I've been in before, where
we were really just trying to get
our friends out to hear us."
Beirut stands out in the music
scene for more than the instant
success story, though. It was the
music - a worldly fusion of horns,
strings and vocals - that first
caught public attention.
"Something that separates
Zach from his time is that he
wants to make music that will last
a longtime - even ifit's notimme-
diately successful to people," Col-
lins said. "You'd never find, say,
delayed vocals in any of his songs.
His music is always rooted in
the past and looking toward the
future."
This distinctive sound has
whisked the band away to coun-
tries ranging from Australia to
Taiwan, a far cry from the bed-
room recording studios the mem-

bers played in before. Collins
recalls the band's firsttour, which
stretched across Europe and parts
of North America.
"The first tour was amazing
and nuts and likea gypsy caravan
or something," Collins said. "We
were all just so young and new to
it ... there was so much discovery,
awe and wonder. Different places
in Europe can get really crazy and
fun. Always fun."
Even with the international
travels and album releases, Beirut
has managed to stay grounded in
its love for New York coffee and
Broolklyn roots.
"We just played in this place
in New York for two nights, and
for me, it was the best two shows
we've ever played," Collins said.

"It was so memorable going home

Shall we canonize the man
already? At this point,
Steve Jobs has already
been hailed as a "secular proph-
et" in The Wall Street Journal,
been blessed
with iPhone
vigils and
enjoyed a
week-long
social media
hashtag
eulogy. From
12-year-olds JOE
on Facebook DIMUZIO
to Barry
Obama, the
nation's basking in the backlit
glow of reminiscence without
much of a second thought. Steve
Jobs, bless you.
But like for any iconic fig-
ure, death has a nasty way of
obscuring the real impact of
someone like Jobs, who, in
many ways, forever changed the
way we listen to music. At this
point, public discourse on Jobs
doesn't escape "What a guy!"
We're the munchkins chant-
ing, "Ding-Dong! The Witch is
Dead" (not to imply that Jobs is
a menace, by any means) with-
out really bothering to explain
why we cared much about her
in the first place.
Jobs's influence is undoubt-
edly enormous, and its implica-
tions are a bit tougher to hash
out. His effect on the world
of home computing is double-
edged. On one hand, he led the
wave of home computing innova-
tion with affordable, stylish and
user-friendly technology. On the
other, he built the company into
the opposite of what it prom-
ised in 1984 - creating uniform
machines for the masses, that
forbade any form of internal
customization while assuring
you of your creativity. Jobs made
us slaves to the Apple Store, the
brand and relentless planned
obsolescence.
I'm not going to pore over
the gray areas of Jobs's career,
which Mike Daisey's op-ed piece
in New York Times last week
effectively handled. One need
only look up Foxconn to tarnish
some of the saintly fluorescent
glow Apple commands. I'm not
going to expound on his quiet
love of LSD, his sober acceptance
of death or the devastation of
pancreatic cancer.
I'm focused, as ever, on the
musical side of things. And when
it comes to the world of music,
Jobs is more Alexander the Great
than Mother Teresa.
Apple's monopolization of
theMP3 and the subsequent
market dominance of iTunes
and the iPod are hallmarks of
Jobs's impact. They completely
changed the way Americans
engage, listen to and share popu-

lar music. He's the man who
deemed a song's worth one dol-
lar (raising it after we affirmed
his judgment) and gave us the
chance to put libraries in our
pockets. The iPod let us wear
music as our personal badge of
identification, one click wheel
away.
This consolidation afforded
new avenues of portability, shar-
ing and ease of access. It also
promoted ignorance - making
iTunes a musical gatekeeper and
rewarding the commitment to a
sole arbiter of taste and availabil-
ity. A generation (or two?) has
grown accustomed to the com-
pressed, unbalanced mastering
of songs tailor-made for uncom-
fortable earbuds. Jobs generated
greater hype for the machines
we used than the music we con-
sumed with them.
The innovations that Apple
and Jobs made in the world of
recorded music remain acces-
sories to the music. They remain,
however stylish and pervasive,
means of consumption.
The iPod is a
technology of
the now.
When does the means
become the music itself? The
terribly compressed song we
play on repeat looking out a
subway window, the mistitled
track on some burned disc we
gave our ex (who we never even
loved), the playlist we craft to
keep us from realizing we are
too tired to keep running ... for
so many people, Apple became
the music itself. Recorded music
remains the primary source
through which we engage in
music, however far away, how-
ever compressed, however slick,
stylized and priced.
Typing this column on a
Mac in my bedroom, I am sur-
rounded by outmoded technol-
ogy. A CD player. A turntable.
A Sony minidisc recorder. My
iPod, scratched and finger-
smudged, sits on my desk. In 30
years, it will be another gadget.
Another punchline of consumer
electronic obsolescence. For
now, whatever attractive plastic
machine sways my wallet in the
future exists in exactlythat -
the future. And free of that, the
music, in a thousand years' time,
will always remain. Mr. Jobs, his
incredible vision and his tech-
nology will not.

"Real Steel" 's idea of innova-
tive storytelling is welding the
elements of generic boxing films
with a science-
fiction setting.
Yet, even with
its laughable Real Ste

story manages Disney
to stay afloat in
the shallow end of the sports film
pool. "Real Steel" promises and
delivers fun, humor and action.
It's a silly concept and a silly
movie with a father-son story too
obvious to prop up its rock-'em,
sock-'em premise. The father,
played by Hugh Jackman ("X-
Men" movies), is Charlie, Ken-
ton, a part-time crook, full-time
unsuccessful robot-boxer, ex-
human-boxer. Charlie throws
himself into every match, search-
ing for the next score to even his
others, no passion or goals. Then
one day his old girlfriend dies
and leaves behind his illegitimate
son, Max, played by a charming
DakotaGoyo ("Thor"). So, Charlie
takes him on a journey to relieve
his debt, as the audience flounders
up to its eyeballs in clichs.
Of course, Max is a streetwise
kid with a smart mouth (who
will undoubtedly be poached by
the Disney Channel). Of course,
Jackman is a horrible father, but
a charismatic figure. Of course,
they learn to love and care for

robot boxing.

One spot in the Michigan Foot-
ball Museum in Schembechler
Hall has remained empty for the
past three years. In the trophy
case for rivalry games, one prize is
missing. Instead, a placard reads:
"The Paul Bunyan Trophy is tem-
porarily located in East Lansing
but will return next year."
Having made sure his count-
down clocks were synced with the
12:01 kickoff time, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke gathered his players
Sunday to discuss the history of
the Michigan and Michigan State
rivalry.
It's the battle for the state and a
battle for bragging rights, he told
the team. A win gives Michigan
alums the edge for an entire year.
Win it for them, he said.
He also told his players that he
won't have to do much motivat-
ing, the seniors and leaders under-
stand what the rivalry means.
They're fighting for the Paul
Bunyan Trophy - also known
as the Governor's Trophy - and
the trophy is won or lost on the
ground.
In 38 of the past 41 games, the
team that ran for more yards pon
the game.
"It was always going to be a
dogfight," Hoke said.
"It always was (the most physi-
cal game). ... They were going
to pound you off the football.
You had to match that intensity.
They're going to punch you in
the mouth and you better punch
back."
This year's version of the epic is
no different.
Michigan boaststhe No. 7rush-
ing offense in the country, led by
its star quarterback Denard Rob-
inson, who already has 720 yards
in six games. But the junior Rob-
inson was having similar success
on the ground a year ago in his
breakout season, and the physical
Spartans dragged Robinson down
from his high.
He threw three interceptions -
the most he would toss all season
and was held to four yards per
carry in a demoralizing blowout
loss.
"They just out-physicaled us

Kevin Koger. "They just play into

Fifth-year senior defensive lineman Ryan Van Bergen has one sack and three tackles for loss in six games this season.

By KEVIN RAFTERY

In Saturday night's 42-24 win
against Northwestern, the Mich-
igan football team was faced
with a scenario the Tune Squad
from Space Jam could relate to.
The Wolver-
ines trailed at NOTEBOOK
halftime and
something needed to change.
But unlike the Tune Squad,
who put together an incredible
second-half comeback to beat the
hated Monstars, Michigan didn't
needa drink of "Michael's Secret
Stuff" to get itself going.
All the Wolverines needed
was good coaching - and they
got it.
"We've made some big adjust-
ments at halftime," said fifth-
year senior defensive end Ryan
Van Bergen. "(At halftime on
Saturday, defensive coordinator
Greg) Mattison and all the defen-
sive coaches sat us down by posi-
tion, and we went through some
different things and simplified
our defense.
"I don't know what it is about
this season, but we don't give up
many points after halftime."
The Michigan defense held
the Wildcats scoreless and forced
two turnovers in the second half.
In a 35-31 win against Notre
Dame earlier this season, the
Wolverines still gave up 14 points
in the final two quarters after
trailing 17-7 at the half, but the
offense stepped up in the sec-
ond half - just as it did against
Northwestern. According to
Michigan coach Brady Hoke,
sometimes it takes time for the
offense to adjust to the several
different looks that opposing
defenses are throwingatthem.
"I think we see something dif-
ferent pretty much allthe time in
how people defend us and really
defend (junior quarterback)
Denard (Robinson)," Hoke said.
"I think (the offensive coaches)
all do a tremendousjob of getting
together and talking during the
course of a game or the first half,
putting their ideas down and
making the appropriate adjust-
ments or changes."
Those adjustments led to 28
second-half points against the
Wildcats and the Fighting Irish.
Although the Wolverines

back, we're not going to control
the line of scrimmage. (Then)
we're not going to win.
"They had a great plan against
(Robinson). They really contained
him to the pocket, didn't let him
get outside. And they were push-
ing our linemen back and (our)
tight ends. So he really couldn't
get out. It's hard to get out when
you have players in your lap or
guys around your legs."
Since then, not much has
changed. Robinson still needs
space. The Spartans are still phys-
ical.
This season, Michigan State
has allowed just 64 rushing yards
per game and two touchdowns
on the ground, good enough for
the third-best rush defense in the
nation. The man in the middle is
one to watch. Junior defensive
end Jerel Worthy, perhaps one of
the best linemen in the confer-
ence, posted three tackles, a sack
and a blocked field goal against
Michigan last season.
"As a player I think he's physi-
cal, a very good athlete," Hoke
said of Worthy. "He's got a great
sense in timing from a fundamen-
tal side on movements and those

things, and he plays with a great
leverage."
Worthy's perfect for disrupting
any comfort Robinson has in the
pocket or running the ball.
Adding to Hoke's worries is
the fact that Worthy and the
rest of the Spartans' front four
is coached by Hoke's friend, Ted
Gill, the man who coached defen-
sive linemen while Hoke played at
Ball State. So Hoke knows they'll
play sound football.
. Hoke will have enough to worry
about with his own defensive line.
All fall camp, the coaches used the
defense's poor history and poor
reputation as motivation.
Trying to emphasize taking
pride in sound rush defense, the
coaches would mention how many
yards were allowed in some of
Michigan's poorer performances.
"Michigan State's one of the
teams that comes up because we
gave up so much yards rushing
to them," said fifth-year senior
Ryan Van Bergen. "They're going
to rush the football. That's what
they want to do. That's what they
are. They run the football and take
shots downfield. So it's going to
fall in our lap as far as the front

seven making sure we can take
control ofthe game and shut down
their rushing attack.
"When it comes to rushing, it's
all about up front - who's more
physical up front. It's always been
about who's going to hit who hard-
er and who's going to move guys
off the ball."
"Physical" might just be Hoke's
middle name. His team has played
with that mentality since he
stepped foot on campus, and two
of the strengths of the 11th-ranked
Wolverines have been the play of
their experienced offensive and
defensive lines.
Leading with their two lines,
Michigan's 6-0 start is different
from past year's fast starts poten-
tially because of Hoke and the
new coaching staff. But each of the
past three losses against Michigan
State began a downslide.
"It's definitely the turning
point in our season," Koger said.
"If you've seen, the last couple of
years, itreally makes or breaks our
season."
Hoke can take solace in that
this one is clearly in the hands of
his linemen - at least it has been
38 of the last 41 times.

would like to start hot from the
beginning, knowing they can
come back from a deficit has its
benefits, too.
"I really think you gain some
confidence because of how
you stay together and how you
respect each other," Hoke said.
"Probably the most significant
thing I've seen out of our guys
is the respect they have for each
other - the respectthey have for
their opponents."
COUNTESS'S IMPACT CON-
TINUES: Freshman Blake Count-
ess's coming-outparty continued
in Evanston on Saturday. After
the cornerback tied for a team-
high in tacklestwo weekends ago
against Minnesota, he recorded
five tackles and one pass break-
up against Northwestern.
Countess originally stepped in
for injured fifth-year senior Troy
Woolfolk, who has been battling
hand and ankle injuries all sea-
son. Though Woolfolk appeared
to be healthy against the Wild-
cats, yet Countess was given the
majority ofthe playing time.
"Blake's ayoungguy who plays
at a high rate," Hoke said. "Watch
him go down on kickoff. He plays
fast. Fundamentally he's pretty
sound. Good change of direction
and those things, and he has a
burstto him."
Hoke did mention that Wool-
folk has been "beat up," but didn't
specify whether that was the
main reason that the freshman
was given the nod over the fifth-
'year senior, or if it was because
Countess has outplayed Wool-
folk.
THE SHAW REDEMPTION:
Prior to Saturday's game, senior
running back Michael Shaw saw
limited playing time in impor-
tant situations.
Against Notre Dame, he had
just two carries for minus-three
yards. But in Evanston, Shaw
played his biggest role yet this
season, carrying the ball six
times for 25 yards.
Hoke teeter-tottered in his
rationale for Shaw's increased
role on Saturday.
"I think some of it's situ-
ational," Hoke said. "I think he's
fought himself back into playing
a little more and has been more
physical.
"He just practiced better. We
evaluate every day."

ICE HOCKEY
Former player Wiseman is Michigan's newest assistant

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
In the early 1990s, a Canadian-
born player passed through the
hallowed wooden doors of Yost
Ice Arena and rewrote the Mich-
igan record books.
"I remember him beingspecial
- like really special," said Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson of his
new assistant Brian Wiseman.
But simply being "special"
wasn't enough to push Wise-
man's application to the top of
Berenson's desk. Berenson fig-
ured who better to bring on to
attempt to continue the record
streak of 21 consecutive NCAA

Tournament appearances than
the man whose team started it.
"We had a list of applicants
this long," Berenson said, gestur-
ing emphatically. "Once I knew
that we had an opening (for an
assistant coach), his name was at
the top of my list. We wanted it
to be a qualified individual with
a Michigan history."
Wiseman fit that bill. And ever
since Berenson first met h'm,
the former center had a certain
swagger about him that couldn't
be ignored and even Fielding
Yost would've admired.
"I remember he came in with
a real good class and he was the
smallest of them," Berenson said.

"But he was like a little general
with his classmates. They'd come
walking down State Street and
they'd all be following Wise-
man."
When his career ended, leav-
ing him as the third all-time
leading scorer for the Wolver-
ines, Wiseman couldn't help but
feel his time in Ann Arbor wasn't
quite over.
"It was always in the back
of my mind that this was a spe-
cial place for me and if I had
the opportunity to come back,
I would definitely jump at it,"
Wiseman said. "S loved my four
years - best four years of my
life."

But Wiseman hung up his
skates in 2005 after a pro career
that saw him float around the
ranks of professional hockey,
including a stint with the Toron-
to Maple Leafs. After a five-year
hiatus from the sport, he realized
that he couldn't stay away.
"I missed the competitiveness
of it, being a part of a team atmo-
sphere - something bigger than
yourself," Wiseman said.
He returned to find Berenson,
the same fiery, careful guardian
of the program that he was when
Wiseman graduated.
"He was agreat communicator
and a motivator and I see those
same attributes now working

alongside him," Wiseman said.
"He's still competitive, he's still
detailed, he's still prepared - all
of those things I experienced as
a player."
And Berenson was relieved to'
see his former standout hadn't
lost his passion.
"His leadership skills' are
excellent and he'S a good teach-
er as well," Berenson said. "He
loves to relate to the players and
he's got great communication
skills."
Back on the ice, Wiseman
treats the Wolverines fairly - as
his pupils, with whom he shares
the uncommon experience of
having played under Berenson.

"He' brings an enthusiasm
and a pride of Michigan that we
already have," Berenson said. "I
haven't been in pro hockey in 28
years. It's nice to have someone
who knows what it's like.
"He's brought some newness
and he's taking in excellently."
Although the Michigan teams
Wiseman played for came up
short - his squads reached two
Frozen Fours but failed to win
a title - he's yet to lose sight of
what drew him to Ann Arbor 21
years ago. And why the nation's
best talent still comes.
"That's why people come to
Michigan - to be-a part of cham-
pionship teams."
