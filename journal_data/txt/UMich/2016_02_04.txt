Pediatrician goes 
over events which 
led to the state of 
emergency in city 

By WILL FEUER

For the Daily

In an effort to have an open 

and transparent conversation 
on the Flint water crisis, Mona 
Hanna-Attisha, director of the 
pediatric residency program at 
the Hurley Medical Center spoke 
at the University Wednesday. In 
an hour-long presentation, she 
offered discussion of a timeline 
for the crisis and medical and 
psychological facts regarding 
lead and possible next steps. 

Hanna-Attisha 
headed 

a study in September 2015 
that showed the proportion 
of children in Flint with high 
lead levels had significantly 
increased, contrary to what state 
officials said at the time.

Sorority members 
talk sexual assault 
within and outside 

of Greek life

By EMILY DAVIES

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University 
Panhellenic 

Association 
partnered 
with 

the University’s Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center 
to host the first annual Greek Life 
Speak Out on Wednesday.

In front of an audience of 

150 students, about 20 sorority 
members made their way to 
microphones at the front of the 
room to “break the silence,” about 
their experiences with sexual 
assault. Between each monologues, 
the audience sat in a silence, amid 
some displays of emotion.

Many women spoke about 

sexual 
violence 
they 
have 

experienced within the Greek 
system, while others described 
their experiences with sexual 
assault outside of fraternity houses 
or the University.

In addition to testimonies from 

sorority 
members, 
Panhellenic 

peer educators — sorority members 
trained to assist and support 
survivors within their sororities 
— read aloud anonymous stories 
submitted through Facebook prior 
to the event.

Due to the confidential nature 

of the event, the Daily was asked to 
not record or quote speakers.

Instead of applause, Panhellenic 

members 
encouraged 
students 

to tie signs to a string stretching 
between 
microphones 
to 

demonstrate their support for their 
sisters.

Return of Kings 

organizer suspends 
member activity after 
protests worldwide 

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

Return of Kings, a men’s 

rights group led by Daryush 
Valizadeh, 
has 
allegedly 

cancelled their Feb. 6 meetups 
in all locations, including one 
stated to be held in Nickels 
Arcade 
in 
downtown 
Ann 

Arbor, according to the group’s 
website.

“I can no longer guarantee 

the safety or privacy of the 
men who want to attend on 
February 6, especially since 
most of the meetups can not 
be made private in time,” 
Valizadeh wrote in a post. 
“While I can’t stop men who 
want to continue meeting in 
private groups, there will be 
no official Return Of Kings 
meetups.”

Valizadeh 
initially 

announced 
worldwide 

meetings for men who read his 
website on Jan. 22. On their 
website, ROK advocates for 
policies that would legalize 
rape 
and 
advances 
“neo-

masculine” thought, such as 
subordinate roles for women in 
society.

The news of Ann Arbor’s 

meet up spread on social 
media late Tuesday night, and 
campus police took steps to 
gain more information about 
ROK’s activities after receiving 
multiple tips from the campus 
community. 
Stockwell 

Residence Hall sent out an 
e-mail 
warning 
residents 

to 
take 
caution, 
and 
the 

University released a similar 
statement Wednesday evening. 

“DPSS 
is 
working 

collaboratively 
with 
the 

Ann Arbor Police as well as 
other local, state and federal 
law 
enforcement 
partners 

to 
monitor 
the 
situation,” 

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said in the statement 

AAPD Detective Lieutenant 

Robert Pfannes did not return 
requests for comments.

Topics of contention 

included Middle

The 
University 
chapter 
of 

Young Americans for Freedom 
held a debate in the Michigan 

League 
Wednesday 
between 

popular conservative filmmaker 
Dinesh D’Souza and University 
alum Bill Ayers, a liberal activist 
turned education professor at the 
University of Chicago. 

LSA sophomore Grant Strobl, 

president 
of 
the 
University’s 

Young Americans for Freedom, 
called the debate the “ultimate 
fight between the left and right.”

The debate was moderated by 

LSA Dean Andrew Martin, each 
debater had 10 minutes to give 

opening remarks and five minutes 
to rebut before opening the debate 
to pre-selected student-submitted 
questions as well as an audience 
Q&A session. The event drew 
almost 500 attendees. 

Before 
the 
debate, 
LSA 

freshman John Sack said that 
he was interested to hear what 
D’Souza and Ayers had to say, and 
was hopng for a lively, healthy 
dialogue. 

The debate covered a variety 

of issues, but specifically focused 

on American foreign policy in the 
Middle East, economic mobility 
and education policy. 

Throughout 
the 
debate, 

D’Souza frequently pivoted back 
to the issue of individual economic 
freedom. This, he said, is one of 
the most important issues to him 
because of his personal experience 
as an immigrant who arrived 
in the country with only $500. 
D’Souza called the freedom to 
pursue financial wealth through 

Members of 

Congress investigate 
individuals involved 

in water crisis

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

The U.S. House Oversight 

Committee hosted a hearing on 
the Flint water crisis Wednesday, 
hearing 
testimony 
and 

questioning several individuals 
involved in the crisis.

The water in Flint has been 

contaminated with lead since 
April 2014 following a switch 
from Detroit city water to 
Flint River water — a decision 
made by the city’s emergency 
manager, Darnell Earley, who 
was appointed by Gov. Rick 
Snyder (R) in September 2013 in 
response to the city’s financial 
troubles.

U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D–

Flint); Joel Beauvais, acting 
deputy assistant administrator 

in the Office of Water at the 
U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency; Keith Creagh, director 
of the Michigan Department 
of 
Environmental 
Quality; 

Marc 
Edwards, 
professor 

of environmental and water 
engineering 
at 
Virginia 

Polytechnic Institute; and Flint 
resident LeeAnne Walters all 
testified before the committee. 

Darnell Earley, previous Flint 

emergency manager, stepped 
down from his position as Detroit 
Public 
Schools 
emergency 

manager 
Tuesday, 
one 
day 

before he was required to testify 
before the U.S. House Oversight 
Committee. 
Earley 
was 
not 

present at the hearing.

The committee exists purely 

as an investigatory body to reveal 
information to the public and 
it will only be able to call forth 
witnesses and make suggestions 
to Congress.

Peter 
Jacobson, 
professor 

of health law and policy, said 
he hopes Congress follow only 
recommendations set forth to

Interim AD 
discusses 

recruitment, 

expanding seating

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Interim Athletic Director 

Jim Hackett and Liz Barry, 
special counsel to University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel, 

discussed ideas for improving 
sporting 
venues, 
the 

recruitment process and the 
importance of a transparent 
relationship 
between 
the 

athletic 
department 
and 

students at an open forum 
Wednesday.

The 
discussion 
was 

coordinated 
by 
Central 

Student 
Government 
as 
a 

venue for students to bring up 
topics pertaining to athletics 

as the University transitions to 
anew athletic director, Warde 
Manuel, next year.

CSG 
President 
Cooper 

Charlton, an LSA senior, said 
the idea for the dialogue was 
generated last semester to 
insure the inclusion of student 
opinions on athletics decisions.

The tenure of now former 

Athletic 
Director 
Dave 

Brandon, 
tenure 
prior 
to 

Hackett, was surrounded with 
controversy and ended in his 
resignation in October 2014. 
During Brandon’s time in the 
position, students spoke out 
against Athletic Department 
moves 
such 
as 
higher 

student section ticket prices, 
advertising 
campaigns 
that 

offered free tickets with Coke 
products and the decision to 
put quarterback Shane Morris 
back in a game with a possible 
concussion.

“We wanted to avoid the 

tumultuous situations we got 

into in the past,” Charlton 
said. “We really wanted the 
students to feel like they are 
part of the process.”

Several students in attendance 

offered ideas to improve student 
seating 
at 
various 
sporting 

events, 
including 
basketball 

and hockey. Currently, student 
sections at Yost Hockey Arena 
and the Crisler Center are 
spread out and divided across 
the 
seating 
space, 
which 

students said diminish from the 
overall bonding and excitement.

Hackett said the excitement 

of the student section is a 
vital part of the University’s 
sporting 
event 
experience 

for both students and other 
attendees.

“I love when we go crazy with 

the students,” he said. “That’s 
what makes me want to go to the 
games: to watch you. Not only 
does the team feed off of it but 
the rest of the fans do too.”

Looking 
at 
recruitment 

— 
specifically 
football 

recruitment — Hackett said 
the values the University was 
built on, such as integrity 
and academic excellence, are 
important when looking for 
prospective players.

“It goes without saying that 

the standards here are pristine 
in terms of integrity,” he said. 
“It’s a 150 year old program, 
and it’s the underlying values 
that make it great.”

The discussion of recruitment 

followed 
the 
University’s 

Signing with the Stars event 
earlier Wednesday for National 
Signing Day, which featured 
University alums Derek Jeter 
and Tom Brady.

Barry also highlighted the 

importance of an open route 

of 
communication 
between 

students 
and 
the 
athletics 

administration, 
especially 

with the ongoing transition 
from Hackett to Manuel.

She said Manuel will be 

willing to work with students, 
but that students also need to 
actively share their opinions 
on these matters.

“Warde 
is 
hard 
wired 

to be connected,” she said. 
“But I think this is kind of 
a shared responsibility. You 

guys reaching out is half the 
equation.”

CSG Vice President Steven 

Halperin, 
an 
LSA 
junior, 

said he appreciated the work 
Hackett has done during his 
time at the University, but is 
looking forward to seeing what 
new leadership will bring.

“He has impressed me and 

the rest of the student body,” 
he said. “We are all going to 
dearly miss him, but we are 
excited for Warde too.”

Republican candidate 
Rand Paul announced 
that he is dropping 
out of the presidential 

race, CNN reported. The 
announcement was made 
following a fifth place finish 
for Paul in Monday’s Iowa 
caucuses.

Movie genre linked to stalking

University researcher 

Julia Lippman conducted 
a study and found that 
romantic comedies 
normalize stalking behavior.

In her study “I Did it 

Because I Never Stopped 
Loving You: the Effects 
of Media Portrayals of 
Persistent Pursuit on Beliefs 
abotu Stalking,” Lippman 
explored representations 
of stalking in Hollywood 
movies to see if women have 
become numb to taunting 
male behavior disguised 
as romance in such films. 
Potentially dangerous 
stalking behaviors are often 
portrayed as romantic in 
films.

Lippman showed her 

426 female subjects 30 
minute-long clips from from 
one of six movies: There’s 
Something About Mary and 
Management, which both 
portray romantic pursuits in 
positive light; Enough and 
Sleeping With the Enemy, 
which convey stalking 
negatively; or March of 
the Penguins and Winged 
Migration, both of which are 
neutral films.

Even before the study was 

published, people have had 
qualms about the nature of 
romantic comedies:

“Stalking myths are false 

or exaggerated beliefs about 
stalking that minimise its 
seriousness, which means 
that someone who more 

strongly endorses stalking 
myths tends to take stalking 
less seriously,” Lippman 
wrote in her study.

After watching the 

excerpts from the films, 
subjects answered surveys, 
one of which posed 
questions about stalking 
myths. Those women who 
watched the first two films 
were generally accepting 
of the aggressive stalking 
behavior.

This study was inspired 

by Lippman’s belief that 
terms such as “Facebook 
stalking” trivialize and 
downplay stalking behaviors 
and gendered aggression.

Hackett speaks with students 
about athletic dept. at forum 

also condemned the group’s 
values.

“The strong and unequivocal 

response of condemnation of 
this group by the University 
community demonstrates that 
our community values respect 
for all persons and rejects 
language 
and 
actions 
that 

promote sexual and gender-
based 
violence,” 
Fitzgerald 

stated. 

A 
Facebook 
event 

started Tuesday night by a 
University 
student 
calling 

for a protest against ROK 
posted celebrating the official 
cancellation. The protest, now 
called the Women’s Rights 
Awareness Rally, will still 
continue as scheduled on the 
Diag Saturday night, according 
to organizers. 

“We 
will 
be 
planning 

events and having speakers/
organizations 
educating 
us 

on several topics including 
sexual assault, women’s health, 
reproductive justice, and much 
more,” the event’s description 

reads. 

Businesses 
around 
the 

Nickel’s 
Arcade 
area 
also 

reacted negatively to the news 
of the meetup. The manager 
of a popular Maynard Street 
bar, who requested anonymity, 
maintained 
that 
security, 

however, would not be an issue. 

“We have so many bouncers 

already, and people walking 
the crowd to make sure no one 
is too intoxicated, or is trying 
to take a girl home without her 
permission,” he said. “Saturday 
night is already busy, and we 
have a great relationship with 

the (city) police, too.” 

Henriette 
Rowland, 
an 

employee of University Flower 
Shop inside the arcade, said 
business owners she spoke to 
were aware of the event, but 
did not want to draw excessive 
amounts of publicity to ROK.

“It’s sad that it’s happening,” 

Rowland said. “And it should 
be against the law. But we’re 
trying to find a good balance 
between not being too crazy 
about it and giving in, but also 
being outspoken about it and 
how ridiculous the whole thing 
is.”

Engineering sophomore Maggie 

Hafers, president of Zeta Tau 
Alpha, said the Speak Out had an 
emotional atmosphere.

“(I felt) shock, heartbreak, but 

also empowerment,” Hafers said.

LSA senior Alyssa Gorenberg, 

a founder of the Panhellenic peer 
educators program, said she hoped 
the Speak Out would help create a 
safer and more supportive Greek 
community.

“We want this event to be a staple 

in our community for the future,” 
Gorenburg said. “I think it’s really 
important to raise awareness for 

our sisters in our chapters and the 
Panhellenic community as a whole. 
I am hoping that people find that 
they have a space that is safe and 
confidential, that they can start to 
heal or continue their process.”

Panhellenic 
Peer 
Educators 

handed out pamphlets at the the 
beginning of the Speak Out, which 
detailed 
confidential 
resources 

available to survivors and allies on 
campus. The back of the pamphlet 
had a blank space left for students 
to write, draw and/or reflect. There 
was also a confidential SAPAC 
advocate in attendance available to 
students if needed.

Though SAPAC hosts annual 

Speak Outs at the University, LSA 
senior Laura Meyer, volunteer 

coordinator for the networking, 
publicity and activism program 
at SAPAC, said there was an 
important 
distinction 
between 

this Greek Life Speak Out and the 
campus-wide one.

“I think a lot of people make 

assumptions about Greek life 
without listening to the lived 
experiences of people within the 
Greek life system, which is why I 
think this is so important to create 
the community where people are 
comfortable listening to each other 
and sharing with each other,” she 
said. “And with that we can try to 
go forward and change the culture 
so this event is not necessary in the 
future.”

Funding awarded to 
encourage medical 
discovery projects

The Center for the Discovery 

of New Medicines has awarded 
funding for discovery projects 
done by University faculty 
regarding important health topics 
such as chronic kidney disease, 
different types of cancers and 
atherosclerosis. 

The grants will help researchers 

advance these projects so they 
can receive more funding from 
additional sources, such as federal 
agencies, foundations and industry 
partners.

The CDNM’s role is to provide 

both financial resources and access 
to technology for researchers who 
could potentially create life-saving 
therapeutic drugs.

Recipients of the awards include 

Ronald Buckanovich, associate 
professor of medical oncology; 
Vernon Carruthers, professor of 
microbiology and immunology; 
and Yuqing Eugene Chen, 
Frederick Huetwell professor of 
cardiovascular medicine. Also 
awarded were Raymond Trievel,

The awards given this year 

ranged from $37,000 to $50,000. 
Since being established in 2012, 
the center has given more than 30 
awards totalling nearly $860,000. 

 

Study on apes 
highlights research 
gaps present in 
Africa, Asia

Anthropologist Andrew 

Marshall, along with several of 
his colleagues, found that one-
third of protected nature areas 
in Africa have not received any 
research attention. These findings 
hold implications that there is a 
disproportionate focus on great 
apes and their homes as compared 
to other equally important species. 
This can hold consequences for the 
field of anthropology, as well as the 
species being neglected.

In a press release, Marshall 

said this obvious preoccupation 
with apes is detracting from other 
species that also need attention, 
especially in this region and in 
tropical Asia. 

Ultimately, nature areas and 

protected national parks in both 
Africa and Asia with great apes 
returned 3.1 times more hits than 
those without great apes. 

These findings lead to 

unrealistic assessments of the 
status of threatened species 
and result in serious gaps in the 
amount of knowledge available 
on how these species live — both 
in protected and unprotected 
habitats. 

 Studies reveal 
average increase in 
fuel economy last 
month 

The average fuel economy for 

new vehicles sold in January 
increased to 25.1 miles per gallon. 
The increase is from 24.9 as 
measured in December. 

Though overall, fuel economy 

is down 0.7 mpg from an all-time 
high in August 2014, it is still 
5 mpg up from October 2007, 
the first month monitored by 
researchers at the University 
Transportation Research 
Institute.

Researchers Michael Sivak and 

Brandon Schoettle also focused 
on a national Eco-Driving 
Index, an index that estimates 
the average monthly emissions 
generated by a single driver from 
the United States. This index 
took into account the amount of 
fuel used per distance driven and 
the amount of driving.

Sivak said in a press release 

that this increase likely reflects 
the seasonal decrease in sales of 
pickup trucks and SUVs, rather 
than an exponential increase 
in the amount of four-doors 
purchased.

help the people of Flint deal with 
the aftermath of the crisis.

“It’s Congress that needs to take 

action,” he said. “The purpose of 
the oversight committee is to hold 
public officials accountable.”

In his remarks, Kildee said 

he thinks it is important to 
recognize that the major decisions 
that led to the water crisis were 
made by Earley and not the local 
government officials.

“So when we talk about failure 

of government at every level, let’s 
just be clear about one point — 
one very important point: Every 
decision that was made for the city 
of Flint that relates to this crisis 
was made by a state-appointed 
emergency manager,” he said. 
“The mayor of the city has no 
authority; the city council in Flint 
had zero authority to make any 
decisions. That is an important 
point.”

According to Jacobson, because 

of Michigan’s Public Act 72 — 
often referred to as the emergency 
manager law — Earley is unlikely 
to face legal consequences for his 
actions as the law provides virtual 
legal immunity for any actions 
taken by an emergency manager.

During the hearing, Kildee 

also submitted a memo from 
the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality which 
indicated they had misinformed 
the Environmental Protection 
Agency regarding their use of an 
optimized corrosion control plan. 
This information could have had 
the potential to keep lead out of 

the water for an estimated $80 
to $100 per day, according to the 
memo.

Walters 
said 
the 
MDEQ 

misinformed the EPA due to 
alleged misinterpretation of the 
law, causing residents to think the 
water was safe for many months 
when it was not.

“The MDEQ claimed they 

misinterpreted 
federal 
law 

regarding corrosion control,” she 
said. “They were allowed to tell 
EPA that they were following the 
law. Citizens in Flint were told 
for 18 months that the water was 
safe.”

Snyder was not among those 

called 
to 
testify 
before 
the 

committee. Jacobson said this 
was part of a partisan bias, in 
which Congressional Republicans 
— who have the majority in 
both 
chambers— 
want 
to 

avoid harming a prominent 
Republican 
governor 
by 

shielding him from any tough 
questions he would face in the 
hearing.

“The majority party rarely 

wants to expose wrongdoing 
among its own party members,” 
he said. “My guess is Snyder 
is not being called because 
they do not want to expose 
him to the questions from the 
minority members.”

U.S. Rep. Elijah Cumming 

(D–Md.), one of the committee 
members, said he requested 
the chair of the commission, 
Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) ask 
Snyder to come and to have him 
submit documents, but was 
refused.

“Governor Snyder should 

have 
to 
answer 
for 
his 

decisions,” Cumming said during 
the hearing. “We asked the 
chairman to invite him today, 
but he would not. We asked the 
chairman to send the same kind of 
document request that we sent to 
the EPA, but he would not.”

Colleen Crossey, a political 

activist 
who 
co-organized 
a 

recent Ann Arbor protestcalling 
for Snyder’s arrest, said in an 
interview that she would like to 
see Snyder face consequences and 
appear before the committee.

“Snyder 
should 
be 
held 

accountable because of his lack of 
oversight,” she said. “I want to see 
him held accountable and for him 
to go to Washington and answer 
the questions that he needs to 
answer.”

video feeds. Public Health graduate 

student Patrick Kelly said he 

attended the event because he saw 

the crisis as an issue that hits close to 

home for him.

“I think it’s one of the biggest 

environmental health crises of our 

time,” Kelly said.

Though the passion in the room 

was clear, it seemed to be driven by 

curiosity rather than outrage.

 “It’s a sad situation, but I still 

need to learn more about it, myself,” 

said Public Health graduate student 

Christian Balcer.

However, by the end of the 

presentation 
some 
attendees 

expressed 
anger 
toward 
the 

government’s 
response 
to 
the 

crisis. Health Informatics graduate 

student Jarrod Sandel said he was 

distressed by the official response.

“You look at the work that Dr. 

Mona and other people have tried 

to do to try to bring this to a head,” 

Sandel said. “And to have them be 

stonewalled at every step is just 

horrendous. It’s a public health 

failure.”

During her remarks, Hanna-

Attisha 
said 
approximately 
18 

months went by with the state 

government and the Environmental 

Protection 
Agency 
withholding 

information.

“Right away the water was 

brown,” Hanna-Attisha said. “It 

looked gross. It smelled gross. It 

tasted gross. People complained 

instantly about rashes and hair 

loss, but it fell on deaf ears … Then, 

in October 2014, GM stopped using 

this water because it was corroding 

engine parts. This is when alarms 

and red flags really should have gone 

off.”

Hanna-Attisha 
also 
noted 

the 
potential 
effects 
of 
lead 

contamination on children. These 

effects may include decreased IQ, 

ADHD behavior and increased 

criminality. Most of all, Hanna-

Attisha said the children and the 

community as a whole have been 

affected by trauma.

“We have a community that’s 

absolutely traumatized,” Hanna-

Attisha said. “I see the moms in 

clinic, and the sacks under their 

eyes. This is trauma for two things, 

loss of trust in their government — 

governmental betrayal and neglect 

for two years. This is 2015. This is 

Michigan. We are literally in the 

middle of the Great Lakes and we 

could not guarantee a population 

that they’re drinking clean water. 

And they’re traumatized by lead.”

Social effects aside, the cost to 

the government for treating these 

ailments will be significant, Hanna-

Attisha added. 

“In the nation we spend about 

$50-100 billion dollars a year 

treating the consequences of lead 

poisoning,” 
Hanna-Attisha 
said. 

“So you add up decrease of lifetime 

earning, special education costs, 

criminal justice costs, mental health 

costs — it is staggering.”

Speaking to ways to buffer 

the impact of lead exposure, she 

also discussed efforts to increase 

accessibility to the Hurley Medical 

Center. 

The Hurley Medical Center 

confronts all the biggest obstacles 

between Flint residents and better 

health 
such 
as 
transportation, 

consistency and diet, according to 

Hanna-Attisha. To combat these 

issues, the center is located next 

to a bus stop, vulnerable families 

visit the same nurse at least until 

the child reaches age two and the 

center is located above a healthy 

foods farmers market, which offers 

special deals to clients. However, 

Hanna-Attisha said the center still 

needs a lot of development. “We’re 

building a plane while flying it,” she 

said.

Hanna-Attisha offered advice 

on how to help the Flint area, 

specifically in regards to the water 

crisis.

“Stop giving us water, we don’t 

need water,” Hanna-Attisha said. 

“What we need is an investment in 

tomorrow.” 

She recommended donating to 

research funds and hospitals on 

the front lines or to community 

organizations helping the day-

to-day situation of these families. 

She finished the presentation by 

emphasizing the need to empower 

children, 
quoting 
Frederick 

Douglass.

“It’s easier to build strong 

children than to repair broken men.”

free enterprise a hallmark of the 
American Dream, and suggested 
students get stipends to attend 
universities and colleges.

In response to D’Souza, Ayers 

questioned the United States’ 
commitment to allocating its 
budget to military engagements 
abroad instead of devoting more 
spending to make education 
more accessible for all students. 

Attendees often cheered in 

agreement with both speakers. 
D’Souza drew raucous applause 
when he stated that health 
care costs kept rising because 
of the high number of people 
who rely upon publicly funded 
health care and the large tax 
burden this poses to the average 
taxpayer.

“The guy who is getting the 

benefit is not the guy who is 
paying for it,” he said. 

Ayers’ biggest applause from 

the crowd came when he spoke 
about privilege throughout the 
country.

“We, as a democracy, as 

a people, ought to say that 
whatever the most privileged 
and wisest parents have for their 
children, we should have for our 
community’s children,” he said. 

Ayers also emphasized the 

important role of education in 
a healthy democracy several 
times during the debate. 

One question submitted by an 

anonymous student directed to 
both speakers was: “If you could 
have been one of the framers of 
our Constitution, what would 
you have changed?”

D’Souza answered that he 

would 
have 
reinforced 
the 

built-in checks and balances 
that help curb the power of the 
government. In response, Ayers 
simply stated that he would have 
changed two things: abolished 
slavery and given women the 
right to vote.

Following the three student-

submitted 
questions, 
Dean 

Martin opened the floor to any 
attendee who wished to ask the 
debaters a question. The topics 

of these questions ranged from 
the Flint water crisis to the 
Black Lives Matter movement.

On the topic of the Flint water 

crisis, Ayers said Gov. Rick 
Snyder (R) should be driven 
from office for his failure in the 
matter. He called the incident 
a 
“catastrophic 
example 
of 

government being run like a 
business.”

When the debate concluded, 

each debater received a standing 
ovation 
the 
audience 
and 

D’Souza and Ayers both were 
approached by dozens of fans 
and critics when they left the 
stage.

In an interview, D’Souza 

described the debate as “more 
substantive” 
than 
another 

debate 
held 
between 
him 

and Ayers, at his alma mater, 
Dartmouth College. He stated 
his desire for liberal universities 
to be more open to dialogue 
from conservative students and 
to be more vigilant to protect the 
right to free speech. He called 
the undergraduate experience 
“a stage of life where you are 
learning,” and said he felt 
political activism on campuses 
to be less important than 
learning from one’s peers and 
developing personal political 
beliefs.

Ayers said in an interview 

after that there was only one 
area that he wished had been 
further discussed — climate 
change.

“Climate change is one area 

where you can see ideology 
trumping reality,” he said. “The 
problem with ideology is that 
it can be helpful as a guide for 
thinking but can also be a prison 
and a trap.”

Strobl said he was pleased 

with the discourse between the 
D’Souza and Ayers, as well as 
the enthusiastic involvement 
from the crowd. 

“I was really happy with how 

the night went,” he said. “The 
debate could not have gone any 
better, especially because both 
speakers were unafraid to take 
on the tough issues. I think that 
is what the campus needs.”

S

aturday evening, I slid into 
the back seat of the third 
Uber I have ever been in. I 

was on my way 
to a near-Main 
Street bar with 
two 
friends, 

both from states 
with 
stricter 

seatbelt 
laws 

than Michigan. 
They 
instant-

ly 
harnessed 

themselves into 
the 
passenger 

and 
rear-pas-

senger 
seats 

of 
the 
Uber 

driver’s car. I remained unbuck-
led in the rear driver-side seat. I 
didn’t even notice I was the only 
one without a seatbelt on until we 
arrived at our destination. Though 
I always buckle up in the front seat 
of any car, it isn’t as instinctive to 
me when riding in the back.

Fifty years ago, the federal 

government passed the National 
Traffic Safety and Motor Vehicle 
Safety Act of 1966, allowing it to 
create and enforce safety stan-
dards for motor vehicles. As the 
years passed, seatbelt require-
ments became more and more 
strict. In 1984, New York became 
the first state to require drivers to 
wear seatbelts.

About one year later, Michigan 

was the third state to enact some 
sort of seatbelt requirement. By 
2000, the Michigan legislature, 
similar to several states across 
the nation, instituted a primary 
enforcement 
law 
giving 
police 

officers the authorization to pull 
over drivers for not wearing a seat-
belt. Originally, officers were only 
authorized to ticket unrestrained 
citizens after pulling them over for 
a separate offense.

In 2004, Michigan was the first 

state east of the Mississippi River 
to achieve a 90-percent seatbelt 
use rate. Five years later, it held 
the national record for highest 
seatbelt use at 97.9 percent. Today, 
Michigan requires that all drivers 

and front-seat passengers always 
wear their seatbelts. However, if 
you are over 15 years of age, a seat-
belt is not required in the back seat 
of vehicles. In 2010, the state had 
the fifth-highest seatbelt-use rate 
at 95.2 percent. Nationally, the 
rate is 87 percent for drivers, 85 
percent for front-seat passengers 
and 78 percent for rear-seat occu-
pants in 2013.

According to the National High-

way Traffic Safety Administration’s 
2010 State and Territory survey, 
“Jurisdictions with stronger seat-
belt enforcement laws continue to 
exhibit generally higher use rates 
than those with weaker laws.”

The Insurance Institute for 

Highway Safety and the High-
way Loss Data Institute notes 
that seatbelt rates are often lower 
among men, younger people and 
occupants of pickup trucks. A 2012 
national telephone survey found 
that short-distance drives, forget-
fulness and discomfort were the 
top reasons for not wearing a seat-
belt among those who sometimes 
used a seatbelt. Among those who 
never wore a seatbelt, discomfort, 
the belief that seatbelts are not 
necessary and a dislike of being 
told what to do were the top three 
reasons for their decisions.

Seatbelt-use rates have soared 

since the 1960s as researchers 
and citizens have come to realize 
how vital they are to protection 
while riding in vehicles. In 2009, 
more than half of passenger occu-
pant fatalities occurred while the 
passengers 
were 
unrestrained. 

NHTSA estimated that seatbelts 
saved more than 62,000 lives from 
2009 to 2013.

Growing up in a rural Michigan 

county, I witnessed a lot of unbuck-
led car passengers. Whenever I went 
on long trips as a kid with my cousin 
and her dad, he would make the back 
seat of his van into a pull-out bed 
and let us sleep during the ride. My 
mom always scolded me, telling me 
to make sure to wear my seatbelt in 
cars, but I was a kid. It was fun not 
having to wear a seatbelt. 

When I turned 16, I stopped 

wearing my seatbelt in the back seat 
during short-distance rides or with 
drivers whom I knew. With fewer 
than 800 residents in my home-
town, the roads are nearly always 
empty. I never questioned my 
behavior until I came to Ann Arbor 
and made friends who did.

After watching the Democratic 

debate nearly three weeks ago, my 
friend Derek offered to drive me to 
my car. It was freezing outside. We 
piled into Derek’s roommate’s car, 
dropped another friend off at her 
apartment and then headed across 
campus to the Maynard Street 
parking garage. Almost 300 feet 
from our destination, Derek had a 
sudden realization.

“You’re not wearing a seatbelt,” 

he said.

“You don’t have to in Michigan 

when you’re over 15 years old and 
in the back seat,” I retorted.

“There’s a strict seatbelt rule in 

this car,” replied Derek’s room-
mate, Sam. “I wouldn’t even start 
the car until everyone was buckled 
when I was a camp counselor.”

“Well, I trust your driving,” I 

directed toward Derek.

“It’s other people on the road 

that you have to worry about,” 
responded Sam, poking me in the 
knee as he said it.

Instantly, I felt guilty. As much 

as I hated to admit it, they were 
right. How many times have I 
heard of a fatality when a car pas-
senger was unrestrained? How 
many public service announce-
ments have I watched about the 
importance of seatbelts? How 
many lives could have been saved 
with a seatbelt?

The answer is too many.
And yet, last weekend I found 

myself once again slipping into 
old habits. I remained unbuck-
led during that Uber drive Satur-
day night. But, looking at my two 
friends safely strapped to their 
seats, I once again felt guilty.

In September 2015, I launched a UROP-

supported project with four undergraduates 
and a graduate research assistant to explore 
and make public the history of LSA’s Race 
and Ethnicity requirement.

The first question we set out to ask and 

answer was: What conditions on campus 
led to the creation of the Race and Ethnicity 
requirement? The second question has to do 
with the process that led to the vote of the 
LSA faculty on Oct. 8, 1990, which established 
the requirement. Leading up to the decision 
were what then-Dean Edie Goldenberg 
called “several years of soul-searching and 
intellectually challenging dialogue” in the 
Spring 1991 issue of LSA Magazine.

“Faculty of all ranks and disciplines 

questioned the rationale of a ‘diversity 
requirement’ and asked how it could fit 
within the traditional understanding of 
a liberal arts education. Some expressed 
skepticism that a requirement would lead to 
the desired outcome, however worthy the 
intent. They were answered by others who 
argued that the College would be derelict if it 
failed to attempt to prepare students to face 
one of the most pressing social problems of 
the late 20th century,” Goldberg said.

While Dean Goldberg uses the phrase 

“diversity requirement” in her carefully 
worded letter to LSA alumni, the real impetus 
behind the requirement was about racism. 
The first proposal for a “racism requirement” 
was generated by a student activist group, the 
United Coalition Against Racism, in tandem 
with two faculty groups: Concerned Faculty, 
and Faculty Against Institutional Racism. 
Motivated by a string of racist incidents on 
campus in 1987, they worked for over a year 
to get the proposal on the agenda of an LSA 
faculty meeting.

Though this first proposal — sometimes 

called the “radical alternative” — was 
defeated, authorization was given to establish 
UC 299 as a pilot course dealing with issues 
of racism and intolerance. This was not what 
UCAR envisioned; the organization sought 
a committee consisting of seven faculty 
members from various ethnic and gender 
studies departments and two students from 
the Baker-Mandela Center to work together 
over the development of the course. They 
feared the course’s supervisory board would 
consist of people who had little understanding 
of race, racism and discrimination.

In the meantime, the LSA faculty continued 

to consider and debate several alternatives. 
All of this unfolded against the backdrop 
of continued student protest by UCAR and 
within the broader Black Action Movement, 

dubbed BAM III. As was the case with BAM 
I and BAM II issues of campus climate, the 
diversity of the student body and the faculty, 
questions of equity in funding and, of course, 
the nature of the curriculum continued 
to swirl. Some administrations, like LSA’s 
Dean Peter Steiner, were denounced as 
unresponsive and obstructionist.

The debates over what would eventually 

become LSA’s Race or Ethnicity requirement 
(the name was changed to Race and Ethnicity 
in 1995) revealed stresses and fault lines 
within the faculty and on campus. Some 
warned of an overly politicized curriculum 
that would substitute “indoctrination” for 
“education”; others warned that the proposed 
requirement would not go far enough in 
fully addressing the underlying problems of 
racism; some feared more student activism, 
while others sought to promote more radical 
alliances between students and faculty. The 
tensions over whether the requirement should 
focus on racism or on diversity was never, we 
think, fully resolved. Most understood that 
no single course or degree requirement was 
sufficient to solve the problems of race and 
racism, intolerance and discrimination.

The debates — captured in the pages 

of the local press, including the Daily, in 
archival materials stored at the Bentley, 
and in the living memory of participants — 
offer a historical window into the origins 
and evolution of the Race and Ethnicity 
requirement. We also believe they tell us 
something important about the history of our 
campus and the ways we have struggled with, 
and sometimes struggled over, questions of 
race, identity and education.

The main goal of our project is to use a 

variety of sources to tell the story of the 
Race and Ethnicity requirement and to find 
creative ways of share our findings with 
the Ann Arbor campus. You can follow us 
on Twitter (@reumhistory). We’ll also be 
partnering with the Daily on an oral history 
project to capture the voices of faculty, 
students, alumni and administrators who 
took part in the events of the late 1980s and 
early 1990s. As LSA continues to review the 
requirement and to think carefully about 
the role of the curriculum in its Diversity, 
Equity & Inclusion plan, we hope that this 
history will help to inform our contemporary 
perspectives.

Stay tuned for more.

History of the R&E requirement

ANGELA DILLARD | OP-ED 

W

ith surprisingly no obligations to 
fulfill, no deadlines to meet and 
no meetings to attend, I laced up 

my running shoes. After 
almost four Ann Arbor 
winters, 45-degree days 
in January are still anom-
alies to me, but they’re 
anomalies 
I 
take 
full 

advantage of. 

I jogged around the cen-

ter of campus and rounded 
my way south through a 
large section of student 
neighborhoods. I origi-
nally told myself it’d be an 
easy jog — a short distance 
at a gentle pace. But I figured I could do a lit-
tle bit more.

I kept pushing onward. One more lap 

around the law buildings seemed feasible. 
Once I reached the last stoplight on my street, 
my over-ambitious mind told my tired limbs 
to work a little harder. It didn’t matter that 
I hadn’t jogged in more than a month or that 
I’d been running for 45 minutes already. I 
probably wasn’t going to be able to squeeze in 
another run for a while.

I sprinted, ignoring the warning signals my 

body was sending.

Darting around pedestrians on the side-

walk, my foot landed in a patch of fresh, 
slippery mud. I tumbled forward, slamming 
onto the concrete driveway of the house 
next to my apartment. My hands — out-
stretched to break my fall — were scraped 
and caked in layers of dirt and blood. Lying 
on my back like an overturned turtle, I con-
ducted an injury inventory.

“OK, so that was probably a bit too much at 

once,” I muttered bitterly as I hobbled along 
the last 30 or so feet to my apartment.

That’s not the first time I’ve uttered that 

phrase, and the tendency to overexert myself 
crossed my mind countless times over the 
past few semesters. Overexertion, for me and 
many other college students, is a matter of 

hindsight. This realization hit as I collapsed 
on the couch at the end of the day, after get-
ting little to no sleep the prior night. It accom-
panied migraines and an empty stomach after 
realizing I forgot to eat until 8 p.m. or when 
two cups of coffee and a bowl of cereal were 
the only things sustaining me throughout the 
day. Additionally, it recently hit when a rela-
tively mild case of bronchitis lingered for an 
entire month.

College cultivates an environment of over-

exertion, and its effects are as diverse as 
the students experiencing this atmosphere. 
As a student population, we’re continually 
reminded that “busy” is always somehow 
“better.” Our success is constantly measured 
according to how hard we push ourselves and 
whether we’re pushing ourselves enough. 
For some, this equates to dividing time out-
side of class between numerous jobs, stu-
dent organizations, internships and clubs. 
As these expectations increase, overexertion 
and exhaustion can plague students regard-
less of their course load. In this balancing act, 
something is always sacrificed — whether it 
be one’s social life, their grades or their physi-
cal well-being.

For students of lower socioeconomic sta-

tus, overexertion is an almost-certainty, and 
large amounts of money and the ability to 
even complete a degree are often at stake. For 
example, students often take heavy course 
loads of roughly 15 to 18 credits for a vari-
ety of reasons: completing a double major, 
switching a major or merely trying to gradu-
ate within four years. However, students from 
low-income households frequently do so out 
of financial necessity. Students coming from 
school districts located in low-income areas 
often are limited in their ability to accrue AP 
or IB credits that could count toward their 
degrees, placing them at a disadvantage in 
comparison to their peers. Taking more cred-
its each semester lessens the time one needs 
to complete his or her degree, and decreases 
the immense financial burden placed upon 
these students.

Falling before the finish line

Recognizing that taking fewer 

than 15 credits prolongs both the 
duration and financial impact of 
one’s college education, the U.S. 
Department of Education recently 
proposed an initiative to restore 
access to Pell Grants throughout 
the year, which would enable stu-
dents from lower socioeconomic 
backgrounds to take courses dur-
ing the summer. Additionally, the 
Department of Education advo-
cated instituting an annual $300 
bonus for students receiving Pell 
Grant funds who take at least 15 
credits per semester. The Depart-
ment of Education claims that the 
credit incentive would aid an esti-
mated 2.3 million students and 
encourage students to complete 
their degree at a faster rate. This is 
all occurring in the midst of “15 to 

Finish” campaign that encourages 
students to take larger course loads 
in order to succeed.

While these initiatives are well-

intentioned and done with an 
awareness of how difficult it can 
be completing a degree in a timely 
manner, incentivizing and encour-
aging students to assume heavier 
course loads places even more stress 
on a population of students who 
are already overworked and strug-
gling with time constraints. Cur-
rently the maximum annual award 
a low-income student can receive 
from a Pell Grant is $5,775. Even if 
a student receives additional aid or 
scholarships, it’s likely individuals 
from lower socioeconomic back-
grounds will need to work to cover 
any remaining tuition costs and 
basic living expenses. The struggle 

to balance long work shifts with 
a larger course load may inhibit 
degree completion rates as well.

The 
efforts 
and 
incentives 

are good first steps on a path to 
improve federal student funding 
and aid students in obtaining an 
education in the most efficient 
manner possible. However, these 
initiatives must be navigated care-
fully, recognizing the pressures 
placed upon student populations as 
they try to balance myriad expec-
tations. If enacted, these propos-
als should aid students while still 
acknowledging that pushing over-
burdened students to move too 
fast may cause them to fall before 
they finish.

‘M’ introduces 2016 class

Star-studded 

bunch helps unveil 
recruits on National 

Signing Day

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Michigan football coach Jim 

Harbaugh said he just wanted 
to do something different to 
introduce his 2016 recruiting 
class this year.

Of 
all 
terms 
to 
describe 

Wednesday’s “Signing of the Stars” 
ceremony at Hill Auditorium, it 
was certainly different.

In his return to college 

football last year, Harbaugh 
was at Michigan for just over a 
month before he introduced the 
2015 class, recruited largely by 
former coach Brady Hoke.

This year, with more time 

to prepare, he had something 
bigger in mind.

“How can we do something 

fun 
and 
a 
celebration?” 

Harbaugh 
wondered. 
“I’ve 

been watching this process, 
experienced it myself, how they 
pull a fax out of the fax machine 
and the coach stands up and talks 
about them, usually says some 
of the same things. We wanted 
to do something different, do 
something awesome. I was really 
pleased. I think today did that. It 
was awesome with a capital ‘A.’ ”

No one knew what to expect 

going 
into 
the 
celebration 

Wednesday. 
Harbaugh 
made 

his first appearance around 
11:40 a.m., introduced by host 
Randy Sklar, after the Michigan 
Stadium 
introduction 
video 

featuring James Earl Jones 
played on the big screen.

He opened and closed his 

opening remarks by asking the 
crowd, “Who could possibly 
have it better than us?” Then, 
he and Sklar sat on a couch at 
one end of the stage in front of 
a packed auditorium. At the 
other end, football analysts 
Mike Shanahan, Todd McShay 
and Lou Holtz sat at a desk and 
broke down Michigan’s class 
as 
different 
celebrities 
and 

Michigan alumni.

New 
England 
Patriots 

quarterback Tom Brady — a 
Michigan alumnus — introduced 
the 
first 
recruit, 
four-star 

quarterback Brandon Peters.

“I don’t know how to put 

it into words,” Peters said 
afterward. “Tom Brady is one of 
the greatest players to ever play. 
I’m a quarterback, too, and he’s a 
quarterback. You just look up to 
someone like that.

“I was kind of nervous at first, 

walking up on that stage and 
seeing all those people. I had a 
bunch of adrenaline, but once I 
got settled in 
and 
started 

seeing things, 
I settled down 
a little bit.”

More 

celebrities 
made 
appearances 
throughout 
the ceremony. 
Former 
New York Yankees shortstop 
Derek Jeter introduced four-
star 
running 
back 
Kareem 

Walker, 
four-star 
defensive 

end Ron Johnson and three-
star defensive tackle Michael 
Dwumfour. Baltimore Ravens 
coach John Harbaugh, Jim’s 
brother, introduced three-star 
tight end Nick Eubanks.

As they were introduced, 

six of the seven early enrollees 
joined Harbaugh and Sklar on 

the stage (the only exception 
was three-star tight end Sean 
McKeon). 
Several 
former 

football 
players 
also 
made 

appearances, including former 
quarterbacks 
Jake 
Rudock, 

Denard Robinson and Devin 
Gardner, former walk-ons Joe 
Kerridge and Jordan Kovacs and 
former linebacker Jake Ryan.

The event was packed all-

around with famous faces, even 
those with no ties to Michigan 
or sports. Many more sent in 
comments 
on 
video: 
ESPN 

broadcaster 
Dick 
Vitale, 

former 
NFL 

coach 
Mike 

Ditka, former 
Michigan 
basketball 
player 
Jalen 

Rose 
and 

actor 
Vince 

Vaughn, 
among 

countless others.

Perhaps the most enthusiastic 

guest was former professional 
wrestler Ric Flair. Harbaugh 
said 
afterward 
that 
Nate 

Johnson gave him the idea to 
invite Flair during a recruiting 
visit at Johnson’s home in 
Tennessee.

“I was telling him about what 

this event was going to be like, 
talking about some of the people 
that were going to be here,” 

Harbaugh said. “I said, Tom 
Brady! Tom Brady’s going to be 
here, the greatest quarterback 
of all time, four Super Bowl 
trophies. They said, ‘We’re a 
wrestling family. You’re going to 
have Ric Flair there. It doesn’t 
get any better than that.’ ”

Toward 
the 
end 
of 
the 

two-hour 
ceremony, 
interim 

Athletic Director Jim Hackett 
introduced 
the 
final 
early 

enrollee, 
four-star 
defensive 

end Carlo Kemp. As Kemp spoke 
with Sklar and Harbaugh on the 
stage, Rashan Gary, the nation’s 
No. 1 recruit, was in New Jersey 
committing to come to Michigan 
next season. The audience found 
out and let out a loud cheer, 
and the early enrollees subtly 
expressed their excitement.

The two-hour show stood 

out. Most schools announce 
their recruits by compiling 
a list of players who send in 
National Letters of Intent and 
holding a press conference to 
discuss them. Michigan took 
over 
the 
conversation, 
for 

better or for worse.

“I 
think 
people 
will 
do 

something similar or they’ll 
criticize it,” Harbaugh said. 
“What do I think of that? I 
probably won’t think much 
of it. It worked for us. It was 
wonderful for us. And why not? 
We’ll be back to work at 2:30, but 
why not have some fun?”

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh introduced his 2016 recruiting class at an extravagant ceremony Wednesday.

“We’ll be back 
to work at 2:30, 

but why not 

have some fun?”

Harbaugh turns 
fantasy to reality 
on Signing Day
I

t started with his usual 
rallying call.

Host Randy Sklar 

introduced 
the man of 
the hour, 
the day, the 
week and the 
year, and out 
came Jim 
Harbaugh, 
ready to put 
on a show.

“Who 

could 
possibly have 
it better than us?” Harbaugh 
asked the crowd, firing them up 
while also reminding them that 
on Wednesday especially, the 
answer was nobody.

Harbaugh put on a spectacle 

to be remembered at Hill 
Auditorium, as his National 
Signing Day special event 
“Signing of the Stars” repeatedly 
crossed back and forth from 
being completely surreal to 
being too Harbaugh-esque to 
not be true.

Ric Flair 

was there, 
reminiscing 
about a 
weekend 
spent at the 
Beta house 
while on a 
recruiting trip 
to Michigan, 
where he 
apparently 
signed a National Letter of 
Intent to play for Bump Elliott. 
Former Michigan quarterback 
Jack Kennedy rapped to open 
for country singer Josh Gracin, 
who opened for Sklar. Tom 
Brady and Derek Jeter sat on 
a couch and introduced high 
schoolers, and then Todd 
McShay, Mike Shanahan and 
Lou Holtz analyzed their film 
on a studio set. Jim Leyland 
dabbed. Let me say that again, 
just so it doesn’t get lost — Jim 
Leyland dabbed.

This was Jim Harbaugh’s 

vision, overset onto the reality 
the rest of us inhabit. With the 
auditorium filled to capacity, 
Harbaugh created a weird, 
fascinating and fun signing 
day carnival that had a little 
something for everyone.

Brandon Peters, Harbaugh’s 

potential quarterback of the 
future, was elated to meet Tom 
Brady. Kareem Walker, one of 
the nation’s top running back 
recruits, was most starstruck 
by Migos. Sklar was taken with 
Flair, Brady and Jeter, but also 
by meeting one of the early 
enrollees, linebacker Carlo 
Kemp.

The fans got their dose of 

Harbaugh, which will sustain 
them only until his next idea 
gives them an opportunity they 
literally cannot get anywhere 
else. The team is going to Florida 
for spring practice in less than a 
month, and you can bet there are 
more big ideas on the horizon.

“This is a perfect example 

of how Jim Harbaugh’s mind 
operates,” Desmond Howard said 
after the conclusion of the event.

And it was a perfect example. 

But it was only a slice of his 
imagination. Signing of the 
Stars brought so many aspects 
of Harbaugh’s first year into 
one big event, including a peek 
inside Harbaugh’s mind, which 
is at once a total mystery and 
squarely in the spotlight.

Wednesday, he took a vision, 

propped it up into 3-D, and made 
it come alive.

Even as silly as it was at 

times, Wednesday was a 
spectacle. Michigan’s early 
enrollees mingled with Super 
Bowl MVPs, MLB All-Stars, 
NFL coaches and analysts and 
more backstage.

Ric Flair charmed and 

disarmed the crowd, and every 
player had a cardboard cutout 
of himself in the lobby. In fact, 
with less than 30 minutes 
remaining in the ceremony, 
the nation’s No. 1 recruit, 

Rashan Gary 
committed 
to the 
Wolverines. 
By the time 
the ceremony 
ended, 
there was a 
cardboard 
cutout of Gary 
in a Michigan 
uniform 
standing in 

the lobby.

These things are uniquely of 

Harbaugh’s conception because, 
if anyone else had the idea, they 
would dismiss it as a fantasy. 
Harbaugh embraces his ideas 
and turns them into reality.

One recruit Skyped in to talk 

about Harbaugh’s sleepover at 
his house. Harbaugh threw a 
pass into the stands and shot 
jokes across the stage with 
Lou Holtz. His brother, John 
Harbaugh, was there, shaking 
hands with Jim’s new players 
and telling a story about how, 
when Jim sent him a picture 
of new tight end signee Nick 
Eubanks, John told him to send 
Eubanks straight to the Ravens. 
And for the love of God, Jim 
Leyland dabbed.

While all of this was 

happening, Gary was going 
through the final moments of 
his selection process. Gary, of 
course, committed to Michigan, 
leading the fans to chant, “GA-
RY, GA-RY,” even though the 
coach couldn’t publicly comment 
on him yet.

Gary missed the spectacle, 

but by signing up with 
Michigan, he won’t miss the 
next one. No one’s really sure 
what that will be, but with 
Harbaugh at the helm, it’s sure 
to be weird, it’s sure to be wild, 
and it will probably be a roaring 
success.

Wolverines suffer 
worst loss of year

No. 17 Michigan 
State overpowers 
‘M’ in East Lansing

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

EAST LANSING — If the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team planned on being the 
“hardest-working 
team 
in 

America” 
— as the 
2015-16 
squad’s 
bold slogan goes — it first needed 
to be the hardest-working team 
in the state of Michigan.

Wednesday, 
that 
wasn’t 

the case, as No. 17 Michigan 
State dominated the in-state 
showdown and powered through 
the Wolverines, 85-64.

The 
21-point 
defeat 
was 

Michigan’s worst loss of the 
season.

The hardest-working player 

at the Breslin Center wasn’t a 
Wolverine, but rather Spartan 
forward Akyah Taylor, who 
spent what seemed like half 
of the game on the hardwood, 
drawing charges and diving after 
loose balls wherever she could.

“We’ve had kids step up and 

get a little more focused,” said 
Michigan 
State 
coach 
Suzy 

Merchant. “Some that is the 
insurgence of playing (Taylor) 
more in the starting lineup. I 
think she took four charges 
tonight. She is the glue that 
nobody really talks about.”

Taylor — who finished with 

four points, eight rebounds, four 
assists — wasn’t the Spartans’ 
leading scorer, but her gritty 
presence fired up Michigan State 
(8-2 Big Ten, 17-4 overall) for the 
team’s fifth straight win in the 
only matchup between the two 
schools this year.

Taylor 
stepped 
up 
to 

command the Spartans’ defense, 
but Michigan State guard Tori 

Jankoska also earned praise 
from 
Merchant. 
Jankoska 

bore the burden of guarding 
Michigan 
sophomore 
guard 

Katelynn Flaherty.

“I 
thought 
(Jankoska’s) 

mindset was great,” Merchant 
said. “Coming in, she really 
wanted to challenge herself and 
guard Flaherty.”

Flaherty put up a team-

high 18 points as well as four 
assists. Freshman guard Boogie 
Brozoski 
aided 
Michigan’s 

backcourt with 13 points, but at 
just 5-foot-6, she couldn’t help 
the Wolverines (4-7, 12-10) where 
they were struggling most. 

That location was under the 

basket, where the Spartans’ size 
gave them a huge advantage.

Michigan freshman center 

Hallie Thome had eight points 
and just four rebounds.

Michigan State outrebounded 

the 
Wolverines, 
38-23. 
The 

leading rebounders were Taylor 
and Spartan forward Aerial 
Powers, who both had eight.

The matchup between the 

centers, Thome and Michigan 
State’s Jasmine Hines, wasn’t 
critical to the outcome, as 
the Spartans’ backcourt did 
everything its team needed.

The trio of Powers, Jankoska 

and 
guard 
Branndais 
Agee 

combined for 63 of Michigan 
State’s points.

“Powers played like the All-

American she is,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “She’s 
tough. I can’t wait ’til she 
graduates.”

Powers — who had a team-

high 27 points — drove to the 
basket the entire first half and 
managed to get both Michigan 
senior forward Kelsey Mitchell 
and Thome in foul trouble early. 
And for every foul Michigan piled 
up, the Spartans capitalized.

Michigan State knocked down 

all of its 19 free-throw attempts.

The Wolverines still have yet to 

beat a ranked opponent this year, 
and their NCAA Tournament 
hopes continue to dwindle.

Breaking down the PairWise

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan hockey team 

was expected to face an uphill 
battle on its quest to make it back 
to the NCAA Tournament from 
the get go.

Why?
There’s really only one reason: 

the PairWise Rankings.

Many experts believed the 

Wolverines’ weak non-conference 
schedule — which featured only 
one team in the NCAA’s Top 20 
preseason ranking (No. 8 Boston 
University), coupled with a weak 
Big Ten — would be Michigan’s 
biggest downfall.

But with six weeks before 

NCAA Tournament teams are 
chosen on March 20, Michigan 
currently sits at No. 4 in the 
PairWise Rankings. 

So, how did this happen?
Well, for one, the Wolverines 

have won games and continue to 
win games.

More importantly, though, the 

teams Michigan played have fared 
better than many have expected.

* * *

But let’s backtrack for a second.
What 
are 
the 
PairWise 

Rankings?

The PairWise Rankings were 

first instituted in 2001, when the 
NCAA moved to the computer 
formula 
after 
many 
experts 

around the country called for it.

How the PairWise Rankings 

work is that three different 
variables 
(RPI, 
head-to-head 

results and common opponents) 
are used to compare every team 
in the NCAA.

For example, since Michigan 

matches up well against 56 
other teams in the NCAA, the 
Wolverines have 56 PairWise 
Ranking “points,” which puts 
Michigan at No. 4 in the rankings. 
(A full grid of PairWise Ranking 
comparisons for each team can be 
found here.)

Along with the three variables 

described, there are also bonuses, 
such as a quality-win bonus, 
which is given to any win against a 
top-20 team, and weights given to 
different wins and losses, such as 
home losses and road wins.

Of course, no new system is 

perfect — tweaks and changes 
need to be made to make it fit in 
with what the formula was meant 
to do.

“(The NCAA) explained that it 

would start off being 75-percent 
win-loss record and 25-percent 
strength of schedule,” Berenson 
said. “Then they kept tweaking it 
until they found the right system.

“There was a point where if you 

won a game against a bad team, 
your PairWise could drop. Now, 
how can that be? You shouldn’t 
be able to go down if you win the 
game, so they’ve had to tweak the 
percentages, and I’m sure there’s 
more to it than that.”

The biggest problem with the 

PairWise Rankings is that while 
we can talk about the variables 
that determine a team’s rankings, 

the NCAA keeps the formula, and 
the math behind it, a secret.

The PairWise Rankings are also 

very elastic. For example, while 
Michigan may be No. 4 now, it isn’t 
out of the realm of possibility for it 
to drop outside the top 10, even if 
it loses only one game the rest of 
the season.

For the most part, most people 

around 
college 
hockey 
have 

enjoyed the change and the fact 
that the NCAA Tournament teams 
aren’t chosen by a committee of 
people.

It is important to note that 

the PairWise Rankings only pick 
the 16 teams in the tournament. 
However, there is a committee 
that 
determines 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament matchups according 
to seeds, proximity to home and 
attendance, among other various 
factors.

* * *

With an explanation of the 

PairWise Rankings out of the 

way, let’s talk about Michigan’s 
opponents this season. Most 
importantly: 
Dartmouth, 

Rensselaer and Robert Morris. 
None 
of 
those 
teams 
were 

expected to make noise in the 
NCAA this season.

Despite this prediction, the 

complete opposite has happened.

The 
Big 
Green 
— 
whom 

Michigan beat, 7-1, before tying, 
1-1, the next night — have played 
well since the New Year. With 
just two losses in 2016 (one came 
against No. 1 Quinnipiac, in which 
the Bobcats needed a six-goal 
third period to come back and win, 
7-5), No. 15 Dartmouth has strung 
together impressive victories over 
then-No. 10 Cornell, then-No. 18 
St. Lawrence and Holy Cross.

The Engineers — whom the 

Wolverines beat, 5-2, back in 
October — started off the year 
with a bang after a win over then-
No. 1 Boston College. Rensselaer 
has collected victories over Yale, 
Miami (OH) and Cornell, along 
with a tie against No. 1 Quinnipiac.

The 
Colonials 
— 
whom 

Michigan beat, 5-3, before losing 
to them, 4-0 — have also played 
well down the stretch. Robert 
Morris currently sits in first place 
in the Atlantic Hockey standings 
and has wins over Penn State and 
UMass-Lowell.

All those teams, along with 

the Big Ten playing a little 
better 
than 
many 
experts 

expected, have helped boost 
Michigan higher in the rankings. 
But at the end of the day, 
Michigan 
will 
continue 
to 

climb the PairWise Rankings 
if it continues to win, plain and 
simple. 
The 
Wolverines 
can 

play hypotheticals about what 
happens if X team loses or Y team 
wins against a top-ranked team, 
but the fact of the matter is that 
if Michigan keeps winning, they 
will be in the tournament.

And the Wolverines know that.
“It’s the idea that we want to 

win all of our games, especially in 
the Big Ten because we know we 
can win the Big Ten,” Nieves said.

Thome shut down 
in loss to Spartans

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

EAST LANSING — Hallie 

Thome’s first point in Thursday’s 
game came on a free throw just 
three minutes into the half.

The only problem? It was the 

second half.

After a 31-point performance 

Sunday, the freshman center 
was shut down in the Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team’s 

86-64 loss at Michigan State on 
Wednesday.

In the first half, Thome largely 

limited herself, earning two fouls 
and playing just eight minutes. 
But even when she was on the 
court, the Spartans had an answer 
for her.

“Hallie 

gets bumped 
around all the 
time,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes Arico. 
“She 
doesn’t 

really go to 
the foul line 
as many times 
as 
she 
gets 

bumped, and 
then she gets fouls called against 
her that are ticky-tack fouls. So I 
think experienced players learn 
how to use their body and not get 
fouls called against them, and I 
think that’s an area Hallie has to 
get better at.”

With Thome on the bench 

more than she was on the floor 
in the first half, the Wolverines 
found themselves down, 48-28, 
at the game’s midway point. 
Michigan State was able to gain 
a 19-12 advantage on the glass in 
the first half, with Michigan’s No. 
1 post player out of the game.

Many 
of 
those 
Spartan 

rebounds quickly became points 
on the other end as Michigan 
State used its speed to push the 
fast break, holding a 31-4 edge on 
the break for the game.

Michigan 
State 
relied 
on 

a 
three-player 
rotation 
to 

keep Thome in check, cycling 

through centers Jenna Allen 
and Jasmine Hines and forward 
Kennedy Johnson. Each of the 
Spartans possessed a strength 
advantage over Thome and used 
it to full effect, keeping her from 
consistently 
establishing 
her 

position on the block.

Whenever Thome found room 

down low, the Michigan State 
defense was quick to send the 
double team. But Thome has not 
yet developed the instinct needed 
to sense when the double team is 
coming and pass out to her open 
teammates.

“They pushed us around,” 

Barnes Arico said. “Hines really 
is physical; she’s physical in the 
post. (Guard Ariel Powers) is 
physical, (guard Tori Jankoska) 

is 
physical. 

So 
that’s 

something 
that 
our 

younger 
kids 

really 
aren’t 

accustomed to, 
and they have to 
adjust to, and I 
think that their 
pressure 
and 

that physicality 
really affected 

us.”

The fouls weren’t the limiting 

factor for Thome in the second 
half, as she only committed one 
more in the game. What was truly 
the issue for Thome was the way 
her defenders were willing to stop 
her. The triumvirate of Hines, 
Allen and Johnson combined for 
nine fouls on the night, with some 
even occurring when the ball was 
well away from Thome.

Thome finished the game 

2-for-4 from the field for eight 
points, and she collected three 
rebounds before she was subbed 
out for the final time with 2:25 left 
in the game.

“She needs to bend and she 

needs to use her body more,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Her lower 
body needs to get stronger, and 
these are all things that we 
are going to spend time in the 
offseason working on.”

Spartans make 
rivalry personal

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

During Big Ten Basketball 

Media Day last October, Michigan 
State coach Tom Izzo was fired up. 
The event just happened to be the 
same week as the in-state rivalry 
football game between Michigan 
and Michigan State, and the hype 
surrounding the two football 
teams made its way to Chicago, 
where the two schools’ basketball 
coaches addressed the media. 

It was also the same day a 

statue of Magic Johnson in East 
Lansing was spray-painted maize 
and blue. 

“First, I’ve gotta say that this 

is rivalry week, and you’re not 
supposed to like your opponent,” 
Izzo said in October. “There’s a lot 
of great Michigan kids, but there’s 
some idiots. There’s some idiots 
on our side, too, that do crazy 
things. Messing with Sparty is a 
bad thing, like messing with their 
‘M’ is a bad thing. But messing 
with Magic, that’s the worst 
thing. I’ll make sure that, from 
now on, maybe the basketball 
team will sleep (out there).”

This 
week, 
football’s 

excitement has once again seeped 
into basketball. Saturday, the 
two basketball teams will meet 
at Crisler Center for their one 
scheduled contest this year, and it 
just happens to be the same week 
as football’s National Signing Day. 

Forward 
Matt 
Costello 

wouldn’t want it any other way.

“The last couple of years, 

Michigan 
hasn’t 
really 
been 

competitive 
in 
football, 
just 

because they’ve had down years, 
but this year, I think it has 
everyone hype all year round 
for that rivalry,” Costello said 
in October. “I think that will 
definitely spill over (to basketball) 
because we’ll have Jim Harbaugh 
at our games and coaches like 
Coach Dantonio. It’s going to 
make the rivalry a lot of fun.”

Costello, a Linwood, Mich., 

native who grew up a Spartan 
fan, thinks his in-state status 

heightens his enthusiasm toward 
the rivalry. The starting center 
isn’t the only one from Michigan 
either. Fellow starters Denzel 
Valentine — whose father played 
at Michigan State — and Bryn 
Forbes both went to Sexton High 
School in Lansing, Mich. 

All three grew up Spartan fans, 

and it gives the trio a lot of fodder 
for conversation.

“We talk about watching the 

games (growing up),” Costello 
said. “Denzel was obviously a 
State fan because of his dad, and 
Bryn (was a fan), so we just talk 
about the different fans and how 
they react to things.”

Michigan’s top talent didn’t 

just land in Izzo’s lap, though. 
He specifically recruited the kids 
from Michigan for a purpose. 

“It’s the whole reason I recruit 

geographically,” Izzo said. “I’ve 
always believed in the state 
of Michigan, and I’ve always 
believed in recruiting in a Big Ten 
area because then those rivalries, 
Michigan (vs.) Michigan State, 
they should know about that. 
They should grow up not liking 
them. That’s kind of what you do. 
And that makes it more fun.”

In-state status may be fueling 

the Spartans on Saturday, but it 
certainly won’t be the Wolverines’ 
main source of energy. Michigan 
has just two players from the 
state of Michigan, junior guard 
Derrick Walton and freshman 
forward Brent Hibbitts.

Part of that reason is because 

Beilein picks up players to fit his 
system rather than making it 
personal. On his current roster, 
he has players from Portland, 
Ore., to Allentown, Penn., to 
Berlin. Next year, only one player 
from the Wolverines’ four-man 
recruiting class is from the state 
of Michigan.

“I think having kids from in 

state make it better,” Izzo said. 
“There’s more passion to it. They 
know their mother is going to be 
at work, their dad is going to sit 
around the drinking fountain, 
and that’s what you play for.”

Writers’ 

Community shops 

student pieces

By NATALIE GADBOIS

Daily Arts Writer

Around the table, talk turns 

to magical superpowers, English 
classes and the questioned exis-
tence of Wookie genitalia. Ten 
or so students joke and posture 
at one another, taking off jackets 
and pulling out laptops, report-
ing aloud answers to Buzzfeed 
quizzes. Time is called when a 
black top hat is placed in the cen-
ter of the room, and the meeting 
begins.

This is Writers’ Community, 

an intimate group of students 
who meet every Thursday to 
workshop one another’s writing. 
Though they come from a variety 
of majors and preferred writ-
ing genres, the members show 
an admirable dedication to their 
work and the improvement of 
one another’s. As club president 
Cammie Finch, an LSA senior, 
said, “It really is a community.”

Legend has it that famed play-

wright Arthur Miller formed the 
organization while he was at the 
University in 1935. Originally just 
seven writers, the size ebbed and 
flowed over the next 70 years, 
even dipping down to two at one 
point. There is no official appli-
cation process; for much of its 
lifetime, Writers’ Community 
has functioned as a semi-secret 
society. Members are brought in 
solely through word-of-mouth.

“It’s always been our persona 

to be sort of a secret society,” 
Finch said. When she joined as 
a freshman, she was one of only 
four in the group, invited by a 
friend who had heard about it 
through another friend.

“Workshopping and present-

ing your work to other people 
where it’s free reign to comment 
and you don’t know if it’ll be good 
or bad can be really frightening,” 
Finch said. “And with the low 
levels of people, that was a good 

space to begin for me.”

However, some of this clan-

destine persona was changed in 
2013 when the group opened up 
to the public, even having a booth 
at Festifall — albeit in the com-
munity’s distinctly quirky way. 
They set up a cardboard poster 
outside of the Dana Samuel Trask 
Building, distant from the other 
Festifall booths, with their mas-
cot the “Dapper Walrus” sitting 
on the table.

“The ones who sought us out, 

those were the people we want-
ed,” Finch said.

This strategy drew in over 50 

people intrigued by the unusual 
nature of the club, overwhelming 
the group for a few months until 
the community was stabilized.

Now, the group comprises 

around 15 writers with a variety 
of writing styles and forms, from 
screenplays to short fiction to 
poetry. There is a benefit to hav-
ing such an arrangement of writ-
ers — their critiques and advice 
build on each other in unique 
ways, enriching the pieces brave-
ly presented at meetings, Finch 
said.

At this meeting, I watch as two 

very distinct pieces are work-
shopped. One, a short story that 
the group has been discussing 
for a few weeks now, is a dysto-
pian tale with a resilient female 
protagonist. As the author reads 
her story, I watch the members 
take notes on their copies, nod-
ding when they like a phrase or 
frowning when a word seems 
off. Though not an official rule 
of Writers’ Community, it feels 
as though honesty is part of the 
sacred ritual here — when one 
participant admits that he dis-
liked a certain character, the 
story’s author isn’t defensive or 
hurt. She takes the criticism at 
face value. Here, opinions are 
valued and respected — the room 
lacks the jealous competitiveness 
often found in writer’s circles.

LSA senior Eugene Jehl, who 

was one of the original four mem-
bers before the group became 
public, finds this sense of cama-
raderie one of the most impor-

tant aspects of the community.

“(In class) you’re kind of judg-

ing each other, or reading some-
thing and thinking, ‘Oh, that’s 
pretty good,’ or ‘Psh, I don’t have 
to worry about that.’ And it’s a ‘no 
one is talking about it, but every-
body’s thinking it’ kind of thing,” 
Jehl said. “That doesn’t exist 
here. We all help each other out.”

Perhaps it helps that it feels 

as though these people truly are 
friends, often flying off on tan-
gents or ragging on each other 
with ease. Jehl finds this to be 
true.

“The people are fun,” he said. 

“Everyone has a great sense of 
humor with each other; some 
are shy or introverted, but that’s 
cool, writers often are,” he said. 
“These have been some of my 
closest friends through my time 
at U of M.”

Despite its semi-secret nature, 

Writers’ Community doesn’t give 
off an air of exclusivity or preten-
sion. As Finch put it, “It’s just a 
bunch of nerds getting together 
each week to help each other 
out.”

Many of the writers are seri-

ous about pursuing careers in 
the field; Finch is planning on 
getting her MFA, while Jehl is 
double majoring in creative writ-
ing and screenwriting. But oth-
ers are only here for their own 
enjoyment: one other member 
is a neuroscience major, another 
planning to become a therapist. 
This diversity of talent and back-
ground is due in part to the move 
to publicize the club.

An introvert myself, I walked 

into the meeting nervous, clutch-
ing my notebook as a crutch. But 
I was instantly welcomed. Jokes 
were made that they all must be 
on their best behavior since I was 
there. People introduced them-
selves and asked about my day. 
It was easy to understand why 
writers are drawn to this place 
and why they push themselves to 
a higher plane of excellence when 
they contribute.

As Jehl said, “I joined three 

years ago, and I’ve never been 
able to get enough of it.”

This weekend Rude 

Mechanicals presents 
“Dancing at Lughnasa,” a 
story of five 
unmarried 
sisters facing 
the inevitable 
unraveling of 
their family.

Written by 

Brian Friel, 
“Dancing at 
Lughnasa” is 
set in Ireland, 
in the summer 
of 1936, during 
the pagan 
Festival of 
Lughnasa. 
“Lughnasa” is a memory play, 
told by the narrator Michael, 
who recounts the events of 
that summer at the cottage in 
Donegal. “Lughnasa” explores 
the complexities of the family’s 
tense relationships, such as the 
sisters struggling with poverty 
and instability. The play also 
highlights the importance of 
Catholicism in Ireland and 
the threat emerging paganism 
posed.

“Lughnasa” first premiered 

in 1990, at the Abbey Theatre 
in Dublin. In 1991 it starred 
in London’s National Theatre, 
earning the original cast three 
Tony Awards including Best 
Play.

With only three and a 

half weeks to put on this 
production, Rude Mechanicals 
is working hard to bring this 
story to life.

Rude Mechanicals is a 

student theater troupe that 
aims to provide quality stage 
productions to the Ann 
Arbor area. The organization 
emphasizes the importance of 
allowing any member of the 
student body to participate 
in the productions, whether 

onstage or behind-the-scenes. 
The organization was founded 
in 1996, by two engineering 
students who realized there 
were few opportunities 
for non-theater students 
to contribute to campus 
productions. Rude Mechanicals 
provides opportunities for 
students in the School of 
Music, Theater and Dance to 
try out roles they wouldn’t 
otherwise be able to explore.

“This opportunity allows 

students to explore other facets 
of themselves artistically 
rather than being confined to 
the thing they decided to major 
in when they were 18 years 
old — it’s an amazing thing,” 
said director Regan Moro in an 
interview with the Michigan 
Daily. 

Moro explained the play’s 

focus on memory — the way it 
shapes us and frames our lives. 
In this play, the unraveling of 
the family is depicted through 
Michael’s memory of the 
events.

“The play encompasses 

so many different things, 
on the most basic level, it’s 
a story about a family that 
is on the precipice of falling 
apart,” Moro said. “It’s also 
a play that examines the 
religious, political, and social 
atmosphere of Ireland.”

The piece examines how 

memories change form and 
frame our outlook, depending 
on what we choose to 
hold onto. Moro said some 
memories are fact-based and 
some are distorted by our 
own perception of the event. 
Michael’s narration walks 
the audience through these 
depictions.

“The last memory I think 

we all have (in this play) is loss 
of our last glittering memory,” 
Moro said, “a memory of our 
family before everything 
dissolved.”

Memory and its importance 

also translate to the technical 
design of this show.

“There are certain details 

of a place, people or of things 
that stick out to you more than 
others,” Moro said, describing 
ideas shaping the production’s 
set and lighting.

The lighting parallels 

Michael’s recounting of 
events — bulbs light up 
above certain characters as 
Michael remembers them. 
Moro described these lights 
as ominous and a way to 
highlight the back and forth 
nature of the plot. Memories 
are given a bluer tone, while 
the present has more pale, 
realistic lighting. These colors 
are shown through costuming 
as well.

“There are bits of blue and 

green, a union of sky and the 
earth,” Moro said. “There 
is something mysterious 
and mystical about these 
colors that lifts it out of the 
drabness.”

Moro also stressed that all 

members of the team — cast, 
assistant director and director 
— have worked together 
equally to figure this piece out, 
rather than dividing positions 
of power.

“There’s no hierarchical 

thing,” Moro said. “We have 
ripped that down and it is all of 
us working together.”

With thematic complexity, 

deep character relationships 
and a collaborative, insightful 
cast, “Lughnasa” has plenty to 
offer.

“The play is full of depth, 

and it’s intricate and complex, 
and I still feel like I’m learning 
more and more about it, every 
single day,” Moro said. “It’s 
an enormous gift to work on 
something like this, especially 
because you feel like the 
growth never stops.”

SINGLE REVIEW

 Yesterday, Feb. 2, I was 

scrolling through my Twitter 
feed out of procrastination when 
I came across 
this golden 
tweet: “Teen 
Suicide is 
Back … Pan-
thers in the 
Superbowl.....
Tied Iowa 
Caucus.....
New Kanye....
wow.....
blessed..... incredible......” tweeted 
by Elvis Depressedly’s twitter 
account. The first phrase “Teen 
Suicide is back….” made me lose 
my breath momentarily. If you 
know anything about Teen Sui-
cide, you know that they haven’t 
released a new full-length album 
since 2012, so this is big news.

Lurking through Twitter, I 

found information about the 
band’s revival. They released 
a single from the new 26-song 
album to be named It’s the Big 
Joyous Celebration, Let’s Stir 

the Honeypot, called “Alex,” and 
when I played this song it was 
like all of my hopes and dreams 
had been fulfilled.

Teen Suicide fans have been 

waiting so long alone in the cold, 
and the band has released a fire 
track to bring us back home to 
the warmth. “Alex” begins with 
Sam Ray’s melancholy voice sing-
ing “Alex is the best / When she 
wants to die,” accompanied by 
the soft sounds John Toohey cre-
ates on the guitar and Alec Simke 
radiates from his bass.

The lo-fi band is sticking to 

their true colors. The entire song 
makes you feel kind of compla-
cent, with lyrics like “We’re both 
only 16 / Skipping class to smoke 
weed,” and “Lying on her back / 
She says she wants to die.” Every 
sound complements the others, 
evoking a simultaneous feeling of 
tranquility and angst. The music 
is diverse and feels like a dream 
in the clouds during sunset. It’s 
gorgeous. April is too long a wait 
for this new album, but the little 
taste they’ve given us makes me 
feel #blessed.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

By MARIAM SHEIKH

Daily Style Editor

While fashion week for 

ready-to-wear clothing hasn’t 
quite begun, the couture shows 
are well under way in Paris. 
With gowns one could only 
dream of seeing in person, 
yet alone wearing, designers 
brought their A-game this sea-
son. But nothing stunned me 
more than the classic styles 
debuted at Valentino’s show.

With ethereal floor-length 

gowns that ranged in color, 
texture and versatility, Valen-
tino creative directors Maria 
Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo 
Piccioli managed to embrace 
all of the new edgy trends this 
season while keeping the ever-
so-elegant Valentino brand 
very much in tact.

Oh, where to begin? The 

show started with flowy gowns 
that pulled from ethereal ele-
ments, in colors ranging from 
deep forest green to oxblood, 
all the way to the it-color of 

the season: mustard. Gowns 
embellished in rich velvet, pat-
terned to perfection with regal 
gold embroidery, were some of 
the most notable.

A bit out of character, some 

designs embraced the pure 
nature of the feminine body — 
with models completely nude 
underneath the translucent net 
and laced bodices, accompa-
nied by a long tasseled robe. In 
a sign of another trend already 
starting to take hold, many 
of the outfits featured floor-
length dusters, which often 
added a pop of color and con-
trasting texture to the runway 
look.

High necks, deep Vs and ruf-

fles all managed to make their 
way on more than one design in 
this couture collection. Accom-
panied by elegant headpieces 
and stunning body jewelry, 
each design from the fabric to 
the accessories was carefully 
curated and calculated to fit 
into the larger collection at 
hand.

Yet with all the impeccable 

designs and added extras, 
nothing managed to distract 
from the outfits. The light-
ness of the designs and the 
effervescent atmosphere of the 
collection overall was different 
when compared with the other 
darker and often heavier col-
lections featured throughout 
Paris couture week.

While none of us mere 

mortals may never have the 
privilege of wearing one of 
these engineered masterpieces, 
I’m sure that we will be see-
ing many of these designs at 
upcoming award shows and 
galas this season. As one of 
the first original houses to 
have started this high-fashion 
industry we style fiends find 
ourselves obsessed with each 
season, Valentino’s couture 
collection catered to the rich 
and famous, the pure, the dar-
ing, the goth, the goddess and 
everyone who finds themselves 
stuck in between.

EPISODE REVIEW

 This season’s “New Girl” 

was off to an uncertain start, 
with its main character Jess 
(Zooey Deschanel, “(500) Days 
of Summer”) 
taking leave 
for Descha-
nel’s pregnan-
cy. Though 
Jess remains 
the lynchpin 
that ties the 
outlandish 
ensemble 
together, her 
absence has left them fending 
for themselves in one hilari-
ously unprecedented situation 
after another.

“Bob & Carol & Nick & 

Schmidt” demonstrates just 
that. Nick (Jake Johnson, 

“Jurassic World”) and Schmidt 
(Max Greenfield, “American 
Horror Story”) must establish 
the boundaries of their extreme-
ly close friendship when Nick’s 
cousins come into town and 
ask Nick to donate his sperm 
to them. When Nick discovers 
Schmidt has planned Nick’s life 
out for him (with charts and 
timelines, no less), Nick realizes 
that it’s not his cousins that he 
must set boundaries with, but 
Schmidt — who spends most of 
the time navigating the help-
lessly dim-witted Nick through 
situations where his judgement 
fails him.

Without Jess, who is seques-

tered for jury duty, Cece (Han-
nah Simone, “Oldboy”) must 
prepare for her wedding alone. 

The well-meaning Winston 
(Lamorne Morris, “Glitch”) 
takes over Jess’s role and over-
enthusiastically goes wedding 
dress shopping with Cece, only 
to sway her into buying a hid-
eously bedazzled dress after 
they both get too drunk off of 
complimentary champagne.

Full of hysterical one-liners, 

this episode is no exception to 
“New Girl” ’s continued ability 
to elicit endless laughs. Despite 
initial doubts over the show’s 
absentee main character and a 
slow decline in its previous sea-
son, the unexpected new bound-
aries have created an element of 
surprise that leaves us looking 
forward to the new ways it will 
have us laughing this season.

Spoon, a college 
mag for foodies

A scrumptious 

look at the online 
food magazine.

By MARIA ROBINS-SOMER-

VILLE

Daily Arts Writer

I’m a foodie. At age 10, I fell 

asleep with a copy of the magazine 
Cook’s Illustrated draped over 
my face. I consider going to the 
grocery store an adventure, and 
sometimes I read Yelp reviews 
while I’m sitting in the restaurant. 
My sister laughed at me while I 
tried frantically to keep a few herb 
plants alive on my windowsill, 
and when I told her that I wanted 
to only eat produce that was in 
season to “enhance my culinary 
experience.” The most serious 
love poem I’ve ever written is a 
three-page ode to pizza. Kitchen 
clumsiness and a few too many 
pieces of burnt toast aside, I’m 
pretty sure I’m a foodie.

You don’t need to be a gourmet 

chef or a food scientist to be a 
foodie. Sometimes, you can be 
a foodie just by falling for those 
suave 
Tasty 
videos 
clogging 

your Facebook newsfeed (and 
maybe clogging your arteries) or 
finding deep satisfaction in seeing 
“The 16 Presidential Candidates 
Reimagined as Food Puns.”

A foodie is a person with an 

especially refined or particular 
interest in food. They can be found 
with a camera lens at table level as 
a sunny-side up egg seductively 
spills out of their burger at Frita 
Batidos, or perfecting a bird’s-eye 
shot of latte art at Ann Arbor’s 
Lab Cafe, all for the perfect 
Instagram. You may find them 
perusing aesthetically pleasing 
food blogs for a recipe to christen 
their recent freedom from dorm 
living, or texting friends to make 
a game plan to tackle Restaurant 
Week.

The rise of foodie culture is 

inextricably linked to the growing 
digital 
world 
and 
increasing 

dependence on social media. The 
organization Spoon University 
has ridden this trend in the online 
food community to success both at 
Michigan and elsewhere. “Spoon” 
is an online publication run by 
college students that focuses on 
producing food-related content. 
The website was launched in 2013 
by Sarah Adler and Mackenzie 
Barth 
during 
their 
time 
as 

undergraduates at Northwestern 
University.

Spoon currently has more 

than 100 chapters at colleges and 
universities across the country 
and has even begun to expand 
internationally to the University 
of St. Andrews and the University 
of Edinburgh in Scotland, as well 
as University of Delhi in India. 
The chapter here at Michigan was 
one of the first five chapters.

I 
met 
with 
LSA 
senior 

Sara Estes who is currently 
the editorial manager of the 
University’s chapter of Spoon, to 
learn more. 

As editorial manager, Estes 

is responsible for overseeing all 
written content and for helping 
writers 
through 
the 
article-

writing process.

“I usually come with a few 

things I want to get written about 
restaurants that are opening or 
closing, or events on campus,” 
Estes said. “Throughout the week 
I’m helping writers if they have 
any questions, and editing all of 
the local articles.”

Writers choose to write local 

articles (Ann Arbor-specific) such 
as “15 Reasons You’re Gaining the 
Freshman 15 at Michigan” or “The 
10 Most Instagrammed Foods in 
Ann Arbor,” which go through 
the editing process at the local 
chapters “National” articles such 
as “5 Ways to Cure Your Nasty 
Cold With Help From Beyonce” 
are sent to Spoon Headquarters in 
New York. There, editors decide 
whether to approve and/or edit 
the content before permitting the 
University chapter to publish it 
locally.

Estes first got involved with 

Spoon when it began at Michigan 
in 2013. She was a sophomore 
looking 
to 
dabble 
in 
the 

intersection of writing and foodie 
culture.

“It was small then, maybe 15 

or 20 of us on the editorial side,” 
Estes said. Now Michigan’s Spoon 
Chapter has upwards of 90 official 
members.

In keeping with the communal 

and collaborative nature of Spoon, 
Estes hopes to develop leadership 
in the organization while still 
respecting the autonomy and 
creative integrity of contributors.

“Regularly I have an internal 

battle of making sure everyone 
is doing what they’re doing, but 
not totally feeling like their boss,” 
Estes said. “I want them to feel 
comfortable asking me questions. 
(At Spoon) you should make of it 
what you want — no idea is a bad 
idea.”

The members meet Mondays 

in a large group, then split off 
into smaller groups to discuss 
the different aspects of the 
organization.

Spoon often takes cues from 

seasonal trends or holidays to 
stay relevant. This can include 
anything from reviewing a new 
restaurant opening up on campus 
to 
planning 
an 
aphrodisiac-

fueled meal to woo a prospective 
Valentine. 
They’ve 
published 

everything 
from 
“Which 

Mediocre Halloween Candy Are 
You?” to “The Stages of Being 
Hangry, as Told by the Grinch.”

Food at Spoon University can 

even extend to health and wellness 
issues. An article recently written 
at Emerson College’s chapter 
discussed the recent introduction 
of more body-positive Barbie 
dolls. Spoon at Indiana University 
recently published an article 
about lead poisoning in regard to 
the Flint water crisis, tying in the 
science of nutrition to an issue 
that is normally targeted in other 
news context.

I sat in on an events group 

that was planning a cookie 
grams Valentine’s Day event and 
exploring options of partnering 
with Insomnia Cookies. Much of 
Spoon’s success has depended on 
partnering with local restaurants 
or gaining sponsorship from 
companies such as GrubHub or 
KIND.

The group has also started 

to 
investigate 
options 
for 

partnership with other student 
organizations on campus that 
incorporate foodie culture into 
their goals and missions — for 
example, they hope to collaborate 
with student group Baking for 
BRCA, a group that sells baked 
goods in order to fund BRCA gene 
research. BRCA mutations can 
increase the risk of certain types 
of cancer. 

Where the editorial group met, 

members bounced ideas off each 
other, engaging in a collaborative 
process to come up with possible 
articles. 
With 
thousands 
of 

articles floating around in the 
Spooniverse, the team seeks to be 
specific, relevant and accessible.

This is where the localized 

aspect 
of 
Spoon 
becomes 

important — members pitch ideas 
such as an article about foods 
that may be scientifically proven 
to increase happiness during 
the dull winter months, or even 
an article sprouted out of the 
odd realization that Patagonia, 
a camping store, sells food. The 
peek into the Spoon meeting 
highlighted why exactly the 
startup runs and succeeds the 
way it does. The environment 
is dynamic and fast-paced — 
members have their laptops open 
to various previously published 
Spoon 
articles, 
food 
blogs 

and master spreadsheets that 
categorize different articles in 
the works.

Estes gave me a sneak peek 

of an upcoming article that 
compares 
different 
foods 
to 

various classes at the University. 
“Of course Comm 101 is avocado 
toast!” she laughed.

Because Spoon’s content runs 

the gamut of anything from 
recipes, to Buzzfeed-style quizzes 
and 
listicles, 
or 
restaurant 

reviews or more health- and 
wellness-based content, it seeks 
to create an accessible and 
inclusive 
environment. 
The 

Internet community that allows 
for connection through the world 
of food may just be an update 
to centuries of people coming 
together over a meal for the 
purpose of debate, intimacy and 

celebration.

Spoon hinges heavily on a 

DIY model — writers can also be 
photographers, event planners 
and social media managers and 
the process of publishing articles 
mainly relies on brainstorming. 
The digital interface has also 
allowed Spoon writers to draw 
on pop culture, like “10 Stages of 
the Yom Kippur Fast, as Told by 
Amy Schumer”, which garnered 
a lot of attention and ended up on 
Buzzfeed. The ability to include 
multimedia 
aspects 
such 
as 

videos, animated gifs or quizzes 
creates a logical avenue for Spoon 
to work with popular websites 
like Buzzfeed that provide fun, 
easy-to-digest content aimed at 
millennials.

Because 
it 
is 
a 
digital 

publication, Spoon also takes 
its social media very seriously. 
I spoke to the social media 
managers 
both 
at 
Michigan 

and at American University in 
Washington, D.C.

Steve Baboun is the creative 

director of Spoon at American 
University, a successful chapter 
that just turned one-year-old. I 
asked him for tips to take great 
food photos.

“Lighting is important, so you 

need good natural light,” Baboun 
said. “You need to get up close and 
personal with your food and not 
be afraid to manhandle it. Filters 
are important, but not over-
filtering it — just playing around 
with contrast and brightness. We 
use a special application called 
VSCO.”

Estes warned against the 

dangers of flash in trying to 
get the perfect food photo, 
which is important to boosting 
Instagram 
traffic 
— 
the 

Michigan Spoon’s Instagram 
has just passed the 3,000 
follower mark.

“Post pictures of things you 

know people are going to love, 
like Aventura Patatas Bravas 
or Totoro Tower,” Estes said. 
“Other than that, just have 
really clean photos of food. 
Never use flash in food photos.”

LSA senior Carly Margolin 

is 
the 
University’s 
Spoon’s 

social 
media 
director. 
She 

echoed Estes’s sentiment about 
the importance of posting fan 
favorites of food to build a “base 
following” and then including 
new and different photographed 
culinary adventures.

With their own office and 

close 
to 
3,000 
Instagram 

followers, the Spoon team at 
American has big goals for the 
future.

“We want to be established as 

the number one foodie group on 
campus,” Baboun said.

American’s Spoon chapter 

has 
benefitted 
from 
D.C.’s 

cosmopolitan 
environment, 

which allows them to plan 
events with many restaurants 
and publish articles such as 
the 
GrubHub-sponsored 
“21 

Delivery Spots Near American’s 
Campus for When You’re Sick of 
the Dining Hall.”

I spoke over Skype with 

Louise Gallacher, community 
manager and co-founder of 
Spoon at the University of 
Edinburgh in Scotland. She 
studies business management 
and heard about Spoon through 
Facebook. The chapter is very 
new, having started just a few 
weeks ago with a small team of 
10 writers.

“I think the beauty of Spoon 

is that it’s all conversationally 
written,” Gallacher said. “It’s 
not like you have to be formal or 
you have to be really confident. 
I think that’s what made me get 
involved 
personally: 
Anyone 

can do it. Anyone can at least 
have a shot.”

This accessibility seems key. 

Readers and contributors are 
invited seamlessly into a foodie 
culture. Even the page for the 
general Spoon recipe article 
index answers hungry college 
students’ questions before they 
even ask them, with category 
options such as “I’m hungover,” 
“I’m tryna be healthy” or “I’m 
a noob” to choose from. The 
content is specific and instant 
enough to satisfy any college 
student’s palate, self-identified 
foodie or otherwise.

Upon walking into Ypsilanti 

Community High School and 
seeing 
Adam 
Collins, 
you’d 

probably think he was a student. 
Even in his second year as band 
director at the school, he still 
gets mistaken for a high schooler. 
At approximately 5 feet 7 inches 
tall, with clean-cut blonde hair 
and a very boyishly mousey yet-
undeniably good-looking face, 
wearing a maroon pullover and 
khakis, Collins doesn’t really 
look like he belongs at the head 
of a classroom.

But when he stands on his 

platform, baton in hand, ready 
to conduct his students, it’s 
undeniable that he does, indeed, 
belong exactly there.

***
At 
approximately 
8 
a.m., 

Collins stands in front of his 
first-hour symphony band class 
and tells them that they sound 
like they are trying to run a mile 
after eating a bunch of Krispy 
Kreme doughnuts.

“Sound like you’re trying to 

run a mile after eating a salad,” 
he pleads with them half-
jokingly.

Analogies are a special talent 

for Collins, as his students 
seem to understand exactly 
what to do whenever he uses 
them, whether they’re about 
doughnuts 
or 
something 
as 

simple as pronouncing sounds to 
make. Earlier in the class, he told 
them to play an “ah” sound to 
elongate their sound, something 
I had never witnessed before in 
non-vocal performance.

Sitting in the back left of 

Collins’ classroom, I’m right 
next to the tuba player. There 
are only three, two of whom 
seem to be putting in a good deal 
of effort, and one of whom seems 
to be pretending to play, as half 
the time he gets his instrument 
up to his mouth several beats 
late.

However, that’s not really 

what’s remarkable about this 
third 
tuba 
player. 
What’s 

worth mentioning is that his 
instrument has a giant dent in 
it. From several feet away, it 
looks like I could probably fit my 
entire fist in it.

According to Collins, only 

about 150 of more than 600 
instruments 
in 
the 
school 

district work. And due to the 
socioeconomic status of many 
of the families in Ypsilanti — 75 
percent are on free or reduced-
price lunch plans, which means 
that, as a family of four, their 
combined annual income is less 
than $33,000 — most students 
can’t afford to rent their own 
instruments.

“I’m making a little more than 

that on my own, and I feel like 
I’m struggling,” Collins said. 
“To quadruple the responsibility 
of that and actually take away 
some of the money I’m making is 
insane to me.”

When the district got a 

quote for how much it would 
take to get the instruments up 
to working condition it was 
$34,000, which is at least $1,000 
more than the annual salary for 
that typical family of four. Over 
the past year, Collins said they 
sent in about $10,000 worth of 
repairs — though he wasn’t sure 
where exactly that money came 
from — but it still wasn’t enough. 
For the first six weeks of school, 
his sixth graders didn’t have any 
instruments at all.

“It was kind of a daily 

improvisation of what we were 
going to do that day,” Collins 
said. “Like, ‘Oh we don’t have 
instruments again today; let’s 
work on rhythm.’ That’s actually 
caused some issues now: because 
they were so accustomed to that, 
they’re still getting used to daily 
procedures and rules.”

Consequently, 
Collins 
has 

learned how to do a lot of repairs 
himself, even though his budget 
for this year was only $350, 
which is “$350 more than I had 
last year.”

To combat this, Collins spends 

a lot of his free time fundraising: 
He’s 
currently 
working 
on 

writing a letter to businesses 
to ask for money. He set up a 
website to fund donations for 
things like instrument repairs 
and sponsorship for students’ 
trips to Boston (while the 
district doesn’t currently have 
the money for this, Collins said 
he has committed to the trip), 
and he has organized other 

fundraisers like selling reeds, 
discount cards and cheesecake.

“Cheesecake is a big one,” he 

said. “A lot of people really like 
cheesecake.”

***
It’s been fated that Collins 

would become a teacher since 
before he was even born. His 
parents met at Eastern Michigan 
University’s music school — 
the same school he would later 
graduate from — when his mom 
accompanied 
a 
performance 

done by his dad. He grew up 
in a musical household and 
described himself as the band 
geek of his high school. Though 
he said he always knew he 
wanted to teach music, this idea 
really became cemented for him 
during his sophomore year of 
college.

On a skiing trip during Spring 

Break, Collins fell headfirst into 
a patch of ice. He wasn’t wearing 
a helmet.

He suffered a broken vertebrae 

and a traumatic head injury that 
was so severe he had to be put 
into a medically-induced coma 
in order to stop his brain from 
swelling. When he woke up, 
his control of the right side of 
his body was minimal, and he 
couldn’t remember the previous 
nine days.

“What mainly got me through 

that was music,” he said. “My 
parents told me that I was 
humming before I was talking 
after the injury.”

While it took him only about 

six months to physically recover, 
Collins said it took him three to 
four years to reach mental and 
emotional stability again.

“I had to relearn everything,” 

he said. “My left hand would 
go straight up and down and 
my right hand would go in 
a circle, so I spent like two 
weeks just working on this (up 
and down) motion,” he said. 
“Because of that, I have a good 
understanding of how to start 
from step one. I mean, it sucked. 
It was awful. But in the long 
run, I feel like it’s actually made 
me a better teacher because it 
gives me some compassion and 
empathy for students who are 
going through other things.”

Some of those things, Collins 

said, are pretty heavy.

“I have students who watched 

their dad get murdered,” he said. 
“I have one student who doesn’t 
have parents. He’s being raised 
by his brother, and he’s one of the 
best kids. To see these kids come 
in every day from that chaos that 
is their life, it’s just absolutely 
incredible.”

It’s obvious Collins cares 

for these kids, and he does 
everything in his power to make 
sure they get a valuable learning 
experience. When he was in 
college, he told himself his 
teaching philosophy would be 
to have his students start from a 
place of passion, but he quickly 
realized that not everyone has 
passion for music. Instead, now 
he tries to find any passion his 
students might have and connect 
that to what they’re playing.

“We did a piece at the 

beginning of the year, and I 
compared it to ‘The Notebook,’ 
” Collins said with emphatic 
arm gestures. “The scene in 
‘The Notebook’ where Allie 
and Noah are on the rowboat 
and it’s raining and Allie’s like, 
‘Why didn’t you write me?’ and 
Noah’s like, ‘I wrote you a letter 
every day for a year.’ It’s almost 
self-sabotage because they’re 
making fun of me for the fact 
that I know ‘The Notebook’ so 
well, but at the same time, we go 
to play this again and they have 
that image in their minds.”

And every once in a while, 

for a student or two, that really 
clicks. Collins had a student last 
year, David, who Collins said 
was rather unsure of himself. 
Throughout the year, though, 
David came in to work with and 
help Collins. He became more 
invested in music, and now he’s 
majoring in music education at 

EMU.

“At the beginning of this year, 

there was a woman who came 
up to me who turned out to be 
(David’s) aunt, and she came up 
to me and gave me a giant hug,” 
Collins said. “She said, ‘At the 
beginning of last year, David 
didn’t have any idea where he 
was going. He didn’t have any 
direction, and I wanted to let 
you know that because of the 
work you did with him and 
the direction you gave him, he 
has a purpose now.’ And like, 
what!? I don’t know how to 
react to that. Being told that I 
basically 
changed 
someone’s 

life, that’s heavy. It’s almost 
nerve-wracking to know that I 
have that potential, for good and 
bad. I could ruin somebody’s life. 
That’s terrifying.”

***
Toward the end of class, 

Collins brings up the YCHS trip 
to Boston. He asks students who 
can afford to go on the trip for 
$0. Everyone raises his or her 
hand. He tells them to drop their 
hands once he reaches a number 
that they don’t think they can 
afford.

$50: A few hands go down, but 

most remain.

$100: A few more go down, 

but still a lot in the air.

$200: Quite a few drop out.
$300: Only about 10 hands 

remain in the air.

He goes down to $250, and 

about 15 more hands shoot up 
in the air; he’s trying to find the 
highest number he can charge 
where at least 35 students can 
come, as that’s the minimum. 
It looks like the number will 
probably hover around $250, 
even though it costs about 
$600 per student for the trip, 
plus 
another 
$10,000 
for 

transportation.

“It’s really challenging to 

balance opportunities with their 
current socioeconomic status,” 
Collins said.

But you can tell these kids 

really want to go. All the kids 
in Ypsi are excited (except for 
maybe dented-tuba kid), even 
when it’s just money talk.

“There are many times that I 

just can’t have my full ensemble 
(in class), so I have to do it after 
school,” Collins said. “I do that 
mainly for their benefit. It’s a 
lot of extra time, but at the end 
of the day, they’re excited about 
it, and the culture is changing. 
They’re getting excited about 
playing music; they want to go 
out of their way to get better.”

These kids practice up to 

twice a week after school, and 
Collins wants to reward that 
hard work with this Boston trip. 
They will get to take a master 
class with members of the Boston 
Symphony and see the symphony 
perform, among other smaller 
events like a tour of Harvard.

“I feel like the reward is 

relative to the effort that they put 
in, and to say ‘You put this much 
effort in, but we’re just gonna go 
to festival’ — I don’t feel like that 
is representative of how much 
effort they’ve put into it,” he said.

But even more than that, 

Collins wants to inspire these 
kids. He wants to push them out 
of their comfort zones, and to 
change their lives for the better, 
even though he’s terrified of 
ruining one.

“The big one I think is really 

that master class because they 
get to see what you can do with 
what you have … to see where 
you can end up if you really apply 
yourself in music,” he said.

He wants to teach them how 

to funnel their emotions into 
music, how to make the best of 
the situations they’re in.

“This trip to Boston we’re 

taking, most of them can’t afford 
it,” Collins said. “But they just 
take that and they say ‘OK, so 
what are we going to do next?’ ”

So what are they going to 

do 
next? 
They’re 
going 
to 

fight. They’re going to stuff 
envelopes with letters to send 
to businesses, they’re going to 
apply for grants, they’re going to 
sell those cheesecakes.

What are they going to do 

next?

Well, they’re going to go to 

Boston.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Taylor Mac soars 
through decades 

By ALLIE TAYLOR 

For the Daily

Performance artist and drag 

queen Taylor Mac, an actor, 
singer-songwriter, playwright, 
director, 
producer and 
above all, 
entertainer, will 
take the stage 
at the Lydia 
Mendelssohn 
Theater on Feb. 
5 and 6. Mac, 
who uses ‘judy’ 
as a preferred 
gender 
pronoun, is in 
the process of 
developing and 
writing “A 24-Decade History of 
Popular Music”: a show where 
judy will perform nonstop for 
24 hours, covering 240 years 
of music. Mac will sing an hour 
of each decade’s most popular 
music, starting from the birth 
of the United States of America, 
all the way up to 2016. The show 
this upcoming weekend will 
consist of songs from the decades 
1956-1986.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Mac chuckled 
when asked what judy’s favorite 
decade to perform was.

“They’re all like children,” 

judy said. “I love them all for 
what they are. They’re such a 
delight to do. Some are harder 
than others, but exciting to do 
because they are harder.”

In the performance this 

weekend, judy will perform these 
three decades for the very first 
time.

“That means (the show) is 

going to have a little chaos in 
it, which usually means it will 

be more fun. Anything could 
happen.” 

Mac has been highly praised 

by The New Yorker, The New 
York Times and New York 
Magazine, and TimeOut 
magazine has deemed judy a 
future theater legend. Judy 
is more than just an actor or 
playwright (judy has also 
written 17 plays) — Mac 
is an artist and a hybrid, 
encapsulating the essence 
of what it means to be a true 
entertainer.

“Being a hybrid isn’t 

something you are taught as 
a child,” judy said. “It’s not 
like people, when you’re a kid, 
say: ‘You know, you could be a 
performance artist drag queen!’ 
” Judy’s actions and ideas of 
non-conformity inspire the 
theater world, as well as inspire 
those who are generally figuring 
out who and what they want to 
be.

Mac’s paradigm-shattering 

plays, behaviors and 
performances connect to judy’s 
audiences so well because of the 
way in which judy approaches 
the crowd and communicates 
with them.

“One of the things I try to 

do is to figure out what the 
audience needs,” Mac said. “It’s 
kind of my job as a theater artist 
to be a student of humanity. One 
of the things I do is say, ‘Well, 
what do I need?’ and because 
I’m, well, a person, if I need 
something, I’m guessing other 
people in the world might need 
it as well.”

A big aspect of judy’s 

artistic philosophy is the idea 
that theater is about healing. 
Judy hopes to bring everyone 
together and consider things 

that people normally may not 
spend time with. Through this, 
judy hopes that “we can heal 
ourselves a little bit from the 
things that are destructive 
in our culture.” Mac is a true 
entertainer that wants people 
who come to the show to laugh 
and be able to experience a full 
range of who they are as people 
and as a community. Above all, 
judy wants people to have a 
“freakin’ good time.”

What’s so wonderful about 

judy’s art form is its spontaneity 
— Mac’s favorite part of judy’s 
work.

“That moment on stage, 

where you know what you’re 
going to do and then something 
different ends up happening 
in the room — you have to go 
with it. You’re doing something 
completely different (than what 
you had planned), and everyone 
is on board and everyone knows 
it’s just happening right then 
and there. That moment is 
glorious.”

Judy’s performances are 

continually executed with an 
ever-present spark. Each show 
is a new experience for Mac and 
the audience, keeping judy’s 
passion alive and audacious.

“We’re doing two shows in 

Ann Arbor,” judy said. “So if you 
see the first night and then come 
the next night, you’ll see two 
different shows. You’ll see the 
same outline, but every single 
night we perform is different. 
And that’s what so exciting.”

When asked what message 

Mac hoped to send to the 
college audience judy will be 
performing for next weekend, 
judy responded.

“Oh, I just hope we hang out 

together.”

Yellow is the new black.

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

There are some reviews where 

I just want to write “that was 
fine” and move on. Some shows 
just aren’t 
doing any-
thing par-
ticularly 
remarkable 
or inter-
esting, 
but they 
make for a 
moderately 
entertain-
ing way of 
passing 43 
minutes 
of my day. 
“You, Me 
and the Apocalypse” fits right 
into that mold. It’s not reinvent-
ing any wheels or doing any-
thing distinct, but it does bring 
a quirky tone to a dire situation, 
making for a fun hour of televi-
sion which could easily turn into 
an enjoyable miniseries.

“You, Me and the Apoca-

lypse” takes place in the 34 days 
between humanity’s discovery 

of an asteroid that’s about to hit 
the Earth and the asteroid’s 
impact. A seemingly random 
group of people end up in an 
underground bunker at the time 
of impact, and the show tells the 
story of how they got there.

“You, Me and the Apoca-

lypse” ’s biggest issue is how 
bland most of the character-
izations are. The first episode 
works hard to give a backstory 
to a handful of the core char-
acters, but it doesn’t do a good 
enough job of giving them 
depth within the backstory. 
Take Rhonda McNeil (Jenna 
Fischer, “The Office”), a death 
row inmate taking the fall for 
her son’s hacking of the National 
Security Agency. In the pre-
miere, she moves into a maxi-
mum security prison and puts 
herself in hot water with the 
people who are there. Fischer 
brings a sense of warmth and 
fear to a character who barely 
has it on the page. Rhonda has 
a thin characterization, only 
brought to life by the performer.

The one exception to this rule 

is Rob Lowe’s (currently on Fox 
in “The Grinder”) character, 

Father Jude Sutton. Sutton runs 
the “Devil’s Advocate” divi-
sion within the Vatican, which 
works to take down people 
who are being presented for 
sainthood. He smokes and he 
curses, so he’s an incredibly 
unconventional priest. That’s 
what makes him stand out; 
he’s not a standard type. Lowe 
brings a natural charisma and 
joke-telling ability that make 
the priest’s barbs that much 
more piercing. He’s the charac-
ter who I’m most interested to 
see grow over the course of the 
series because his foundation is 
the strongest.

Yet there’s a certain quirk to 

everything “You, Me and the 
Apocalypse” does. It’s familiar 
to anyone who’s seen “Shaun of 
the Dead.” It makes light of the 
end of the world. However, this 
series doesn’t have Edgar Wright 
at the helm to bring a visual 
inventiveness to the jokes. Still, 
that doesn’t mean the series isn’t 
good or isn’t worth watching. 
There’s enough in Lowe’s char-
acter alone to support a series, 
and hopefully the ensemble 
around him grows as well.

TRANSVIOLET

Transviolet, you’re turning violet!

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

“When you do find some-

thing that you care about, don’t 
be afraid to share it, and get 
involved. There is nothing cool 
about ‘not giving a fuck.’ That’s 
just lazy. I do give a fuck. And 
I’m not afraid to say it.” – Trans-
violet in an interview with 
TMRW Magazine.

Once again, Spotify’s Discover 

feature came in great use to me 
three weeks ago when making 
the long, arduous trek from Chi-
potle back to my apartment. I 
owe many burritos to the genius 
who made it possible for my love 
of relatively small bands to be 
satisfied this easily. On this par-
ticular, chilly January evening, 
Transviolet played through my 
crackling headphones and I fell 
in love. It just sounded so cool.

While it was more difficult 

than anticipated to find informa-
tion on this lovely band, I have 
since discovered that Transviolet 
is an LA-based quartet com-
prised of band members Sarah 
McTaggart, Judah McCarthy, 
Michael Panek and Jon Garcia. 
Utilizing no website or Wiki-

pedia page, Transviolet instead 
relies on their own social media 
to foster their relationship with 
fans and create an intimate and 
personal platform. Releasing its 
debut single in July 2015, Trans-
violet has since skyrocketed in 
popularity after receiving public 
endorsements from Katy Perry 
and Harry Styles. In September 
2015, its first self-titled EP hit 
the charts as the band played 
on “The Late Late Show with 
James Corden.”

Transviolet takes the best 

aspects of electronica, pop and 
synth to create a sound entirely 
its own. The opening track of 
Transviolet, “Girls Your Age,” is 
Lana Del Rey meets electropop. 
It’s sultry, seductive and cynical 
rolled into one when McTaggart 
sings, “Bad boy talking fast / 
Talking dirty / He tells me that 
I’m hot / So I tell him that I love 
him.” While the instrumentals 
remain minimalistic in order for 
the lyrics to take precedence, 
the vocal skill makes up for any 
loss in bass. In a nod to del Rey, 
the song ends with, “Live fast 
while you’re young, honey.”

“Bloodstream,” my personal 

favorite from the EP, takes on a 

heavier rock sound with strong 
vocals and crashing drums. 
Consistent, underlying synth 
retains the electronic vibe, yet 
brings a angsty edge to an oth-
erwise upbeat song. “New Bohe-
mia” continues to make social 
observations without sounding 
preachy. It speaks to the new 
generation and urges us to chal-
lenge preconceived notions 
and make our own mark on the 
world, insisting, “In waves we 
crash, one voice / Making head-
lines just for kicks / Trying to get 
love, not trying to get rich.” 

The closing track, “Night 

Vision,” retains the strongest 
electronic vibe, opening with 
artificially produced beats and 
crashing synthetic echoes. Sub-
dued vocals croon, “Get on your 
knees / And praise me like you 
should.” With relaxed verses and 
a booming chorus, the juxtaposi-
tion creates a tangible shift in 
energy within the listener.

The band’s social activism and 

desire to support other groups are 
just a few of the ways Transvio-
let’s making its own imprint on 
the musical sphere. One thing is 
certain: This is just the beginning 
for Transviolet.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 Sometimes, when 

teenagers get bored, they 
make music videos. And when 
they make 
music 
videos, 
they 
usually 
do them 
poorly. 
They 
follow the same formula: a 
bunch of solo shots dancing in 
front of the camera intended 
to make them look really cool.

It’s not a stretch to say that 

Kevin Gates’s music video 
for “Castle,” released Jan. 
29, uses this tired formula. 
The song, which isn’t even 
on the rapper’s recently 
released studio album, Islah, 
spends a lot of bars talking 
about Gates’s metaphorical 
kingdom and how anybody 
who challenges such a power 
structure will be shot at (a 
lot).

The video’s plot is 

straightforward in that there 
isn’t one. Save an opening 
scene in which a subservient 
waiter serves a mimosa that 
Gates immediately laces with 

codeine, the rest of the video, 
which spans four minutes and 
16 seconds, consists of Gates 
dancing and generally doing 
random things throughout 
nighttime Brussels. Even the 
end of the video just kind of 
fades away.

It does little to complement 

a hook-friendly, trappy 
song similarly devoid of 
any discernible societal 
implication. It’s literally 
Gates, wearing a funny hat, 
doing funny dancing. It’s 
somewhat fun, though, which 

provides the bulk of the 
entertainment value.

The entire thing seems as 

if Gates and his crew were 
chilling together one day 
and thought it would be fun 
to shoot a music video in 
a foreign city. Each shot is 
hastily done; even the picture 
is low quality. Everything 
about it is down and dirty, 
which, at this point in his 
career, personifies Gates as 
well.
