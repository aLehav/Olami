UNIVERSITY A DMINIST R ATION
Rejection of document request a
'misunderstanding,' offcils say

Regents minutes not
available a month
after Dec. meeting
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
Though University spokespeople
initially denied The Michigan Daily
access to a copy of the December
Board of Regents meeting minutes
last week - an action which may

violate the Michigan Open Meet-
ings Act - spokespeople are now
classifying the incident as a "mis-
understanding."
A request from The Michigan
Daily last Friday to view a copy of
the proposed minutes from the
regents' December meeting was
denied by a University spokes-
man. But after reviewing internal
processes and legal obligations,
University spokespeople say the
request was denied, not as part of a
formal policy, but instead because

of an internal misunderstanding.
Section nine of the Michigan
Open Meetings Act - a law that
governs what public entities are
obligated to do when holding board
meetings - mandates when cop-
ies of both proposed and approved
minutes must be released to the
public.
"Proposed minutes shall be
available for public inspection not
more than 8 business days after the
meeting to which the minutes refer.
Approved minutesshall be available

for public inspection not later than
5 business days after the meeting at
which the minutes are approved by
the public body," the act states.
While the University complies
with the act's requirements regard-
ing approved minutes, University
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald denied a
request to review a copy of the pro-
posed meeting minutes on Friday,
nearly a month after the December
meeting.
Fitzgerald told the Daily on Friday

ECONOMIC IMPACT
At Ross School and beyond, the
recession is a real life teaching tool

Profs. reworking
their courses to

economic realities
By ANNIE GORDAN THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
The impact of the financial crisis
onWall Street has beenwidespread,
but what is not as well-known is the
impact the financial crisis is having
on Tappan Street.

In many classrooms at the Ross
School of Business, for BBA and
MBA students alike, the financial
crisis is serving as an educational
tool to think about current issues
in the business world. Some class-
es are specifically covering events
that have occurred throughout the
recession, while others are being
restructured using the economic
downturn as a practical guide.
Valerie Suslow, associate dean
for, degree programs in the Busi-
ness School, explained that some
courses will be updated to thor-
oughly study risk and others will

be designed to give students lead-
ership skills to cope with difficult
economic times in the future.
"We're taking a more compre-
hensive approachtoriskassessment
in some of our finance courses,"
Suslow wrote in an e-mail inter-
view. "The Finance Department
has revamped its curriculum to
make sure everything fits together
and addresses recent issues."
One such class is the Macroeco-

Roland Fryer
studied successes of
non-profit in Harlem
By SUZANNE JACOBS
For the Daily
Roland Fryer, a professor from
Harvard University, spoke in frontof
a packed auditorium yesterday about
the success of a non-profit organiza-
tion.in Central Harlem that has made
strides in closing the racial achieve-
ment gap in the area.
Fryer discussed a recent paper
that he co-wrote with Will Dob-

bie, an economist at Harvard, that
used an empirical test to analyze the
impact of The Harlem Children's
Zone - a non-profit organization
based in Harlem.
Fryer, who is CEO of the Educa-
tion Innovation Laboratory at Har-
vard, found that the HCZ has seen
remarkable success in its aim to
shrink the racial achievement gap.
"There is something out there
that's actually working," he said.
"The question is, how can we boil it
down to pill form so we can transfer
it other places?"
The HCZ began in 1990 as a mod-
est one-block pilot and has since
expanded to an extensive 97-block

area full of programs aimed at going
beyond the classroom to help rebuild
the entirecommunity.
The organization is designed to
follow children from an early age,
assisting them all the way through
high school. HCZ's involvement
begins with "Baby College" - a col-
lection of workshops for parents of
children from ages 0 to 3 years old.
The children have access to in-
school, after-school, social service,
health and community-building pro-
grams.
Fryer said the achievement gap in
New York City starts to appear among
kids at age 2, noting that a 17-year-

Tears and laughs punctuated a
memorial service yesterday in the
Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre for

former University President Rob-
ben Wright Fleming, who passed
away earlier this month at the age
of 93.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman, President Emeri-

and other campus figures shared
their personal memories of Flem-

University from 1968 to 1977 and
as interim president in 1988.
The speakers emphasized

Fleming's character, disarming
humor and skillful navigation of
the turmoil that gripped many
college campuses in the late 1960s
and 1970s.

NEWS BRIEFS
" DETROIT
Court orders Detroit
ex-mayorto pay
$300,000 to city
Former Detroit Mayor Kwame
Kilpatrick lied again to the citi-
zens of the city he once led, a
judge said yesterday as he ordered
the disgraced official to pay more
than $300,000 in restitution
within 90 days or face further
punishment.
During a restitution hearing,
Wayne County Circuit Judge
David Groner had harsh words for
the ex-mayor and convicted felon,
calling his conduct "reprehensi-
ble" and accused him of showing
"contempt" for Detroit.
"You have not been credible
in this courtroom and again you
have not been honest," Groner
said. Kilpatrick was silent during
the hearing, shaking his head on
occasion as the judge made his
ruling.
LANSING, Mich.
Unemployment rate
drops to 14.6 percent
A Michigan's unemployment
rate improved in December for
the third straight month, drop-
ping slightly to 14.6 percent, state
officials said yesterday.
The new rate was down from
a national high of 14.7 percent in
November. The state jobless rate
peaked for the year in September,
when it hit 15.3 percent.
Modest recalls of laid-off auto
workers and a slower pace of job
loss in the service sector helped
stahilize Michigan's unemploy-
ment rate in the second half of
2009. The state spent the first
" half watching its rate climb as the
national recession worsened and
General Motors Corp. and Chrysler
LLC went through bankruptcy,
causing Michigan to lose more than
100,000 manufacturing jobs.
But the losses, which averaged
33,000 jobs a month in the first
half of the year, slowed to 2,000 a
month in the second half.

Angry man kidnaps
4Gwha tossing_ --
teenager
Police said a prank turned
potentially dangerous when a man
angry about a snowball hitting
his car allegedly pulled a knife
on a group of youths and kid-
napped one of them. No one was
injured. Joshua Good, 25, was to
be arraigned Monday in Superior
Court on charges including first-
degree kidnapping, threatening
and reckless endangerment. The
kidnapping charge carries 10 to 25
years in prison.
Police said a group of youths was
throwing snowballs near Colony
Park Friday night when Good's car
was hit. Police say Good threatened
the youths with a knife and forced a
13-year-old boy into his car.
Authorities say Good drove the
boy home and didn't hurt him.

Good posted $150,000 bail. He
didn't immediately return a phone
message yesterday.
BEIJING
* Chinese teen.
praised as hero for
killing local official
When Li Shiming was stabbed,
through the heart by a hired
assassin, few of his fellow villag-
ers mourned the local Communist
Party official many say made their
lives hell by seizing land, extort-
ing money and bullying people for
years.
Instead, villagers in the north-
ern town of Xiashuixi have made
Li's teenage killer something of
a local hero. More than 20,000
people from the coal-mining area
petitioned a court for a lenient
sentence.
"I didn't feel surprised at all
when I heard Li Shiming was
killed, because people wanted to
kill him a long time ago," said vil-
lager Xin Xiaomei, who says her
husband was harassed for years
by Li after the two men had a per-
sonal dispute. "I wanted to kill Li
myself, but I was too weak."
The murder trial has again cast
a harsh light on abuses of power
by communist cadres and the
frustration many ordinary Chi-
nese feel with a one-party system
that sometimes allows officials to
run their districts like personal
fiefdoms.

Daily wire reports

Democrats see
Mass. message:
Jobs, jobs, jobs

After surprise loss
in Mass., Dems push
for greater emphasis
on the economy
WASHINGTON (AP) - Wound-
ed in Massachusetts, frustrated
Democrats yesterday urged the
White House to focus on jobs and
the economy - not the health care
overhaul that's now at risk = and
pressed President Barack Obama
to more forcefully make their
case against Republicans ahead
of potentially disastrous elections
this fall.
On the day after the improbable
Senate election of Republican Scott
Brown in Massachusetts, Obama
and his Democratic Party raced to
re-evaluate their midterm election
strategy, adjust their health care
approach and assuage an angry
electorate. The embarrassing
defeat to the GOP in a Democratic
stronghold was a bitter end to the
president's first year in office, and
it triggered furious party soul-
searching.
"I would like the Democratic
Party as a whole including its lead-
er, the president, to speak clearly
about the differences and to define
those differences," Sen. Robert

Menendez of New Jersey, chair-
man of the Senate Democrats'
campaign effort, told The Associ-
ated Press. And it's not just about
Republicans and Democrats, he
said: "We have to do a much-better
job ofbothengagingand delivering
to independent voters."
Obama himself owned up to a
failure to communicate.
In a year of hopping from crisis
to crisis, he told ABC News, "we
lost some of that sense of speaking
directly to the American people
about what their core values are
and why we have to make sure
those institutions are matching up
with those values."
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.,
put it more simply, assessing the
message Massachusetts sent.
"Economy, economy, economy,"
she said.
"We need a jobs bill. We need
short-term, focused strategies to
create jobs, real fast," said Sen. Bob
Casey, D-Pa. "If the dominantmes-
sage isn't about jobs and spending,
we'll be making a difficult chal-
lenge exponentially more diffi-
cult."
At the Capitol, Sen. Claire
McCaskill, D-Mo., declared, "If
there's anybody in this building
that doesn't tell you they are more
worried about elections today, you
should absolutely slap them."

MIAMI (APJ - Tammy Gge
cries every time she turns on the
TV and sees the devastation in
Haiti. And'thongtrnheahemdy has
three daughters, she didn't hesitate
when her husband suggested that
they adopt from Haiti.
"That's all he needed to say," she
said.
Gage and her husband Brad are
among many Americans express-
ing interest in adopting children
who have been left orphans from
the quake last week. Adoption
advocacy groups are reporting doz-
ens of calls a day.
"The agencies are being flooded
with phone calls and e-mails," said
Tom Difilipo, president and CEO of
the advocacy group Joint Council on
International Children's Services.
"The response is 'Can we help with
these children by adopting them?"'
The need is vast. Even before
last Tuesday's deadly magnitude-
7.0 earthquake, Haiti, one of the
world's poorest countries, had
380,000 orphans, according to
UNICEF. There is no.counting
children newly orphaned by the
quake, but aid groups estimate
the number in tens of thou-
sands.
"Everybody here and in the
world wants to do something.
I think it's a way that people
are opening up their heads and
their hearts," said Mary Ross
Agosta, spokeswoman for the
Archdiocese of Miami, which
has offered temporary housing
for children until they are either
placed with extended family,
put in foster care or adopted.
This week, 54 orphans
arrived in Pittsburgh after a
mission that involved officials
in the White House, the State
Department and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. The
orphans were being cared for
at Children's Hospital of Pitts-
burgh. So far, seven children
have been placed with their
adoptive families.
"We have received quite a
few phone calls, including one
from as far away as Alaska," said
Clare Kushma, a spokeswoman
for Catholic Charities of Pitts-
burgh. She estimated the num-
ber of calls as close to 100, but is
referring people to the Allegh-
eny County's Department of
Human Services for adoptions.
The road to adoption is a long
one. The orphans coming to
the U.S. now are children who
either had already established a
relationship with potential par-
ents in the country, or who were
certified as orphans before the
quake but hadn't been placed
with parents yet, said Chris
Bentley, a U.S. Citizen and

titnigration Services spokesman.
Before new adoptions can occur,
officials need to establish that the
children are identified by the Hai-
tian government as orphans; there
have been reports of families sell-
ing their children to adoption bro-
kers. And potential families need to

"All this is a2-year process mini-
mum," Difiliposaid. "Somefamilies
ht faedive yers" ,--
New solutions may be enact-
ed for these orphans, though,
said Mary Robinson, CEO of the
National Council for Adoption. Her
advocacy group has gotten an offer
from Puerto Rico to serve asa rest-
ing place for children until they are
adopted.
State Department spokesman
Darby Holladay said the orphans
are one of the highest priorities for
the U.S. government.
"We are looking at each and
every orphan case individually and
we are working around the clock
with officials of both Homeland
Security and the Haitian govern-
ment to find solutions," he said.
He said the U.S. Embassy in
Haiti has processed immigrant
visas for 46 orphan children whose
cases were ready for processing.
In addition, there have been 100
humanitarian waivers for orphans.

The Department of Home-
land Security has also set up an

Strong winds and
heavy rain forces
locals to leave homes
LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE,
Calif. (AP) - A third powerful
Pacific storm pounded Califor-
nia with heavy rain and snow
yesterday, forcing evacuations of
hundreds of homes below wild-
fire-scarred mountains, shutting
a major interstate and unleashing
lightningstrikes on two airliners.
Fierce winds howled along the
coast and in the mountains, and
forecasters warned of rainfall rates
as high as la!0 inches an hour on soil
already saturated from two days
of wild weather that caused urban
street flooding in coastal cities,
spawned a damaging tornado and
toppled trees, killing two people.
Despite stern pleas from
authorities and door-to-door calls
by police officers and sheriff's
deputies, some residents refused
to comply with evacuation orders
issued for Los Angeles-area foot-

hill communities below the steep
San Gabriel Mountains where 250
square miles of forest burned in a
summer wildfire.
Rick and Starr Frazier put their
faith in concrete barriers and a
2-foot-high wall of sandbags on the
perimeter of their home in La Can-
ada Flintridge.
"Look at our house, we're pretty
well fortified here," Starr Frazier
said. "If any rain or mud or any-
thing comes down;it'll be blocked
by our barricades and we're very
well stocked with food and water."
When they told Los Angeles
County deputies they weren't leav-
ing, the deputies asked them to
fill out forms stating they'd been
advised of the danger. They also
were warned it might not be pos-
sible to rescue them.
While most others in the Fra-
ziers' community appeared to be
complying, officials in nearby Los
Angeles reported only about 40
percent compliance by residents of
262 homes in that jurisdiction.
Police Chief Charlie Beck sternly
urged the rest to go.

The re4al'real cost of raises'

MANAGING EDITOR

Bringin' down the house
State should ensure that federal funds help communities
With little cash to fund projects that will enable Mich-
igan's economic recovery, the state has received a
helping hand from the federal government. Michigan
was recently granted $223.9 million in federal stimulus funds,
designated for allocation to the development and restructuring
of housing facilities in struggling communities across the state.
During this particularly stressful time for the housing market,
Michigan needs support for recovery initiatives. But though the
potential of this project is encouraging, it must place its primary
focus on the people most in need of housing. To utilize the funds
most effectively, the state must focus on the creation of more
affordable housing options for Michigan residents.

n a recent editorial, the Daily
requested that University fac-
ulty and staff accept wage and
salary freezes in order to curb tuition
increases and
improve under-
graduate edu-
cation (The real
cost of pay raises,
01/07/2010).-
With all due
respect, Daily
editorial board, .
you can pry my
3.4-percentyraise PATRICK
from my cold, dead O'MAHEN
hands.
And you can
expect the same
attitude from all the custodians, food
service employees, librarians, lectur-
ers and landscapers if you want them
to hand back their hard fought wage
gains. Fine, so that's overdramatic,
but the editorial's naivet hbothered
me on several levels:
First, it asserted that salaries
played a major role in the spiraling
tuition costs. Then, citing a Decem-
ber University report, the editorial
board lauded the leadership roles of
19 senior administrators who are vol-
untarily forgoing merit pay increases
this year. They then implored other
employees to follow the example of
our selfless leadership.
Butin their hurry to swallow a Uni-
versity press release that highlighted
deans and administrators refusing
merit raises, the intrepid researchers
on the editorial board forgot to, well,
do some research.
If they'd actually bothered to do
some simple digging in the Faculty
and Staff Salary record - which the
Daily ironically provides access to
on its website - staffers would have
uncovered a larger pattern of gener-
ous salary increases for major uni-
versity administrators that easily
outstripped other employee compen-
sation increases over the last decade.
Let's start at the top. In 1997, then-
University President Lee Bollinger
earned $275,000 in base salary. In

2008, current President Mary Sue
Coleman earned $553,500. That's a
total raise of 101.3 percent. During
that same time frame, the provost's
salary has increased from $230,000
to $366,000, an increase of 59 per-
cent. Finally, the LSA dean's base pay
has increased by 88.4 percent, from
$207,000 to $390,000.
In contrast, GSI salaries increased
roughly 40 percent from 1997-2008.
Other unionized employees had simi-
lar or smaller raises during that time,
as did most non-onionized staff,
though exact numbers are more diffi-
cult to calculate in those cases.
During that same time period, in-
state tuition rose 93.3 percent. Do you
notice how top administrative sal-
ary increases tended to be a lot closer
to the tuition increase than other
employee's salaries? And these num-
bers don't include goodies like deferred
compensation, housing, car allowances
and the like, which pushed Coleman's
total compensation package to nearly
$760,196 last year, according to the
Daily. Finally, notice how the three
positions I cite draw all their compen-
sation from tuition and state funding. I
haven't even mentioned the 47-percent
raise the new athletic director will get
this year.
In addition, over the last year bene-
fit cuts have affected most employees,
who have little choice in the matter.
All non-unionized and some union-
ized employees have been forced to
increase their contribution to their
health insurance premiums. I sup-
pose the Daily could be forgiven for
not praising their sacrifices, because
a bunch of librarians, custodians and
IT people don't contribute to under-
graduate education, right? That is,
they don't matter unless you care
about finding materials for a research
paper, having your dorm bathroom
kept clean and keeping your wireless
network working.
Administrators have also increased
their health care contributions as
well, but paying 30 percent of the
roughly $7,200 annual family health
care premium hits a custodian earn-

ing around $29,000 a year much
harder than it hits LSA Dean Terrence
McDonald's $390,000 salary. (For the
record, McDonald got a $63,000 raise
in 2008, while some custodian got
well under $1,000)
GSI pay raises
don't affect
tuition increases.
The limited data of the salary his-
tory shows that retaining individu-
als generally doesn't seem to cost as
much as hiring new ones - especially
outside candidates. For example,
Coleman's salaries since her hiring
have generally tended to increase
in three to four percent increments
- from $475,000 in her first year to
$484,000 to $501,000, $516,000,
$531,000 and finally $553,500. The
big jump came in the year of Bol-
linger's departure and Coleman's
arrival, in which the president's sal-
ary jumped by at least 30 percent.
A similar story pertains to the pro-
vost's position. In 2007 and 2008,
University Provost Teresa Sullivan
earned healthy but hardly notewor-
thy raises of 3.5 and 3.9 percent. In
contrast, the first year that she took
the position, the provost's base pay
jumped 16.4 percent. I can't wait to
see what the new provost's salary
package looks like. If it's a raise simi-
lar to what Sullivan had, the new sal-
ary could move to nearly $450,000.
When the Daily reports on the new
provost and relays the usual breath-
less administrative banalities about
what a magnificent hire she or he is,
maybe then the editorial board will
remember to ask for some leadership
on the salary front. Perhaps, then it'
might sound a bit less tone deaf than
it did two weeks ago.

At a press conference last week, federal
Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan, along
with Gov. Jennifer Granholm, announced
that the state will receive $223.9 million
from the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development. The Michigan State
Housing Development Authority origi-
nally applied for $290 million for the pro-
gram, but was only granted a portion of its
request. The money the state received will
be put towards the "New Michigan Urban
Neighborhood Plan," a project that intends
to rebuild an estimated 1,500 foreclosed
and vacant homes and demolish 2,500
more across the state. Detroit will receive
the largest bulk of the funds at $40.8 mil-
lion, but the initiative has also directed sig-
nificant funds to several other communities
including Lansing, Kalamazoo and Flint.
On top of the economic advantages of
the "New Michigan Urban Neighborhood
Plan," it's a bonus that the project won't
place another tax burden on already-strug-
gling Michigan residents because the proj-
ect is funded by the federal stimulus plan.
It's only logical that the Housing Develop-
ment Authority applied for the cash. There
would have been no excuse for missing out
on free federal funds for a state that des-
perately needs to give its economy - and
its people - a boost.
The "New Michigan Urban Neighborhood
Plan" has the potential to play an impor-

tant role in rebuilding Michigan's stagnant
economy. The blighted properties lower
the property values of a community and
discourage the recovery of the struggling
housing market. The "New Michigan Urban
Neighborhood Plan" will demolish vacant
and foreclosed properties in areas particu-
larly affected by the recession and build
new homes in their place. The revitalization
of these neighborhoods will create a more
attractive community that will improve the
housing market in these areas.
But the residents of distressed areas like
Detroit and Flint need more than attrac-
tive new homes. Individuals who have been
hit hardest by Michigan's especially dismal
economic downturn have equally pressing
needs. The federal money should address
the most pressing needs of the state - and
families struggling to make ends meet are
in desperate need of affordable housing.
When the Michigan State Housing Devel-
opment begins to build these new and
improved facilities, it must make construct-
ing affordable housing that accommodates
low-income residents a top priority.
The "New Michigan Urban Neighbor-
hood Plan" offers a change to encourage the
state's economy and the revival of decay-
ing communities. But the true value of this
programgoes far beyond the economy. The
creation of more affordable housing is nec-
essary to help people and families in need.

COLLEGE DEMOCRATS|
AlookbackatObama'sfirstyear

When President Barack Obama took office
one year ago on Jan. 20, 2009, our nation was in
the depth of the worst economic crisis since the
Great Depression and burdened with two costly,
directionless wars. From his first day in office,
Obama has made these challenges his top prior-
ity. He has focused on returning our economy
to its former vitality, bringing the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan to successful conclusions and
reforming the health care system. Obama has
also signed laws to strengthen civil rights pro-
tections and worked to regain respect for the
United States from other countries.
As his first major legislative initiative,
Obama persuaded Congress to pass the Ameri-
can Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which
renewed government investment in infrastruc-
ture, science and education, while saving the
jobs of thousands of Americans. In addition,
he successfully managed the Troubled Assets
Relief Program, which garnered a $4 billion
profit (a 15-percent return on investment) for
U.S. taxpayers. The program helped preventthe
collapse of the American financial sector and
thaw frozen credit markets.
Obama also recognizes the necessity of a
strong industrial sector to the vitality of the
middle class and to the strength of the Ameri-
can economy. He encouraged federal involve-
ment to help General Motors Corp. and Chrysler
through bankruptcies and to set the companies
on track to return to a competitive position in
the global marketplace. Following this restruc-
turing, the Democrats passed "Cash for Clunk-
ers," a popular and successful program that
provided a much-needed boost to domestic auto
sales while helping to reduce carbon emissions
from American automobiles.
Also on the domestic front, Obama signed
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which
strengthens the 1964 Civil Rights Act, giv-
ing victims of employment discrimination an
increased ability to recover damages. This law
aims to protect employees from discrimina-
tion on the basis of sex, race, color, religion or
national origin.
In addition to strengthening employment
discrimination laws, Congress passed the Mat-
thew Shephard Act of 2009, which extends
federal hate crimes protections to LGBT
Americans. The bill was named for a Univer-
sity of Wyoming student who was tortured and
killed in 1998 because of his sexual orientation.
Republicans in Congress have long opposed
extending hate crimes protections to cover
LGBT Americans, but Obama signed the bill
into law in October.
Obama continues to champion health insur-
ance reform and has made more progress
on the issue than any president in history.

Although the legislation has yet to be finalized,
it should decidedly improve competition in the
health insurance market, reduce costs of cover-
age and expand access to care. It will prohibit
health insurance providers from discriminat-
ing against people due to pre-existing condi-
tions and bar them from dropping patients that
get sick. This reform will benefit students by
requiring health insurance providers to cover
individuals under their parents' plans until age
26. Despite lacking a filibuster-proof major-
ity in the Senate after Tuesday's special elec-
tion for the Massachusetts Senate seat, health
insurance reform will likely pass Congress in
the coming weeks.
Overseas, Obama has faced the difficult tasks
of rebuilding our diplomatic alliances, imple-
menting a new strategy in Afghanistan, man-
aging operations in Iraq and fighting terrorism.
Today, the U.S. is once again making diplomacy
a central component of its foreign policy and
has rebuilt alliances around the globe. Obama
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his
efforts to promote peace and diplomacy.
Obama has proven his commitment to fight-
ing terrorism by emphasizing the war against
al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. In
his first month in office, Obama ordered an
increase in troop presence there and has placed
American forces on the offensive against ter-
rorist leaders. In addition, he has worked with
General Stanley McChrystal to employ new
strategies that recognize the unique nature of
the war in Afghanistan.
In Iraq, Obama has continued to implement
the Status of Forces Agreement that American
commanders negotiated with the Iraqi Govern-
ment, which should end the presence of Ameri-
can forces in Iraq by the end of 2011.
Obama has also reclaimed the moral high
ground in the War on Terrorism. He has ended
the use of torture and is implementing plans to
close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. He has
begun the process of prosecuting accused terror-
ists held in American custody. Obama's anti-ter-
rorism policies have improved America's moral
standing, revitalized its international respect and
kept America safer from terrorist attack.
There is no simple solution to our nation's
problems, but Obama's first year is an example
of the determination and hard work that has
made our nation great. His efforts are far from
complete - our country certainly has more
challenges ahead than behind - but Obama has
made remarkable strides in addressing issues
of critical importance.
This viewpoint was written by Robert
Bowen and Josh LeVasseur on behalf of the
University's chapter of the College Democrats.

This week, as political pundits
analyze President Barack
Obama's first year in office
ad infinitum, I'm
trying to remem-
ber the optimism
that surrounded
his inaugura-
tion just one year
ago. I recall fan-
tasizing about an
overwhelmingly
Democratic Con- X
gress passing bill T
upon bill, legislat- MATTHEW
ing progress and GREEN
reversing eight
years of conserva-
tive damage.
Well, my dreams haven't exactly
come true ... yet. And I won't take the
time to once more enumerate all of
the terrific things that the Democrats
have not yet done. But I'm a little ner-
vous that in the upcoming midterm
election, congressional Democrats
won't be given a chance to continue
fighting for all the reforms impor-
tant to liberal America. In the last
election, Democrats were afforded
a unique opportunity. The Left, gal-
vanized by its hatred of George W.
Bush, came out like never before in
support of Obama and congressional
Democrats. Moderates also voted
largely Democratic because they, too,
found regime change appealing.
But this year, during the midterm
election, Democrats won't have the
advantage of being on the better side
of public anger. And insofar as it may
seem that Democrats have the upper
hand at the moment, liberals won't
vote with the intensity of a resolute
underdog. Republicans, however,
probably will. They are outraged
by Obama, pissed at Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and
for a variety of reasons, they just gen-
erally vote more passionately than
liberals.

By nature of their usual defer-
ence to status quo, conservatives
generally feel a much greater sense
of urgency than liberals do when it
comes to social change. On abortion,
for instance, liberals speak abstract-
ly about a woman's right to choose,
where conservatives view the matter
as one between life and death. Ergo,
those on the Right are naturally more
inclined to spring to action, when lib-
erals tend to be much more passive.
This phenomenon accounts for why
abortion is still a hot-button issue,
even though a 2006 Gallup poll found
that roughly 80 percent of the coun-
try believes it should be legal at least
under certain conditions.
Yet liberals have reasons to be fer-
vent, too. Perhaps even more than in
2008, the Left has a lot at stake. First,
Democrats need to maintain their
congressional majority to ensure that
meaningfulhealth reform is achieved.
Even if the current Congress works
out some legislation, reform will
likely require more intricate con-
sideration in the years following the
passage of an initial bill. Additionally,
in order to guarantee that economic
recovery is carefully managed, Con-
gress can't revert to the economic
deregulation that led to the enormous
financial irresponsibility that ruined
the economy in the first place. And all
of that is set against a social backdrop
in which much progress - matters of
income inequality, immigration, labor
reform, gay rights, etc. - has yet to be
set into motion.
With so much left to be accom-
plished, the Democrats must work
overtime to avoid a repeat of the 1994
midterm election, when public frus-
tration with the Democrats in power
led to a major Republican fakeover of
Congress. And their work is cut out
for them. This year, as tried-and-true
Democratic Senators Byron Dorgan
of North Dakota and Chris Dodd of
Connecticut both retire, the Demo-

crats will have considerable difficulty
replacing them - even though Dodd
was expected to lose if he did run for
a sixth term. Ten Democrats in the
House aren't seeking re-election and
the party is losing certain key gover-
nors to term limits this year.
After one year,
Democrats have
lost their zeal.
It is, perhaps, a slight silver lining
that Republicans are losing even more
incumbents: fourteen in the House
and six in the Senate. But given the
increased public frustration with the
current Democratic Congress, paired
with the fact that most of these seats
are in solidly conservative districts,
the replacement of these legislators
should be rather easy for the GOP.
The bottom line is that Democrats
could easily lose more than they gain
this year if liberal leadership can't
maintain an energized base. Hope-
fully the economic measures they
have just put in place will lead to a
stronger economy in the summertime
before the election, increasing their
public support. But they cannot rely
solely on that.
Democrats cannot rest on the lau-
rels of their victories in the past two
elections. They must find a way to get
leftward-leaning Americans behind
their message strongly enough that
they will actually come out and vote.
And if Democrats don't succeed in
bringing the debate back to core issues
that matter to liberals, they'll regret it
when their significant congressional
majority slips away from them.

stronger, and I believe it was
because of Robben's matchless per-
sonality," Coleman said. "He was
the perfect leader for an imperfect
time."
"He approached crises as oppor-
tunities for growth, change and
problem-solving," said Henry John-
son, a former vice president of stu-
dentservices at the University.
Coleman also lauded Fleming's
contributions after the Black Action
Movement student strike in 1970.
The strike resulted in acommitment
by the University to work toward
10-percent African-American stu-
dent enrollment by 1973, many of
whom were the first in their family
to attend college.
Coleman said she met with
approximately two-dozen such stu-
dents in New York when they were
taking part in a documentary on
affirmative action in higher educa-
tion, some 25 years after Fleming
left the University in 1979.
"Among these first-generation
collegegraduates, 95 percentoftheir
sons and daughters had gone on to
college - 95 percent of the children
of men and women who themselves
never imagined higher education as
a part of their lives," said Coleman.
"That is the legacy of Robben Flem-
ing."
Coleman also read a letter from
former president Harold Shapiro,
who wrote that Fleming's decision
to offer him the vice presidency of
academicaffairs"decisivelychanged
the path of (his) career."
The Men's Glee Club also paid

that it is "standard operating proce-
dure" not to place proposed minutes
from Board of Regents meetings
online until the next month's agen-
da is posted and that the Daily could
not view the document until it was
placed online.
However, after the Daily cited
the University's obligations under
the Michigan Open Meetings Act,
Fitzgerald and University spokes-
woman Kelly Cunningham revised
their responses to the Daily.
In a joint interview with Cun-
ningham and Fitzgerald yesterday,
the two called the University's pre-
vious statement the result of a mis-
understanding.
"The procedure is that we provide
the draft minutes upon request and
then we post them on the web the
Monday before the meeting under
the agenda," Cunningham said. "It
was just a misunderstanding."
Cunningham said it was possible
that the Daily's initial request was
misunderstood.
"The only thing I can think of is
maybe there was a confusion about
(the proposed minutes) being on the
web and (staff) were thinking that's

old black adolescent often has the
reading level of a 13-year-old white
child. Strategies normally employed

to close this gap include early child-
hood programs and offering smaller
schools and classes. These strate-
gies individually, Fryer said, have
been largely unsuccessful.
Fryer said the HCZ, which com-
bines academic and community
programs, is an ideal testing ground
for determining whether or not
community involvement is neces-
sary in closing the gap.
In his experiments with the
achievement data from the HCZ,
Fryer said he used a carefully
crafted algorithm to measure the
impact of the charter schools in
"the Zone" on test scores. Fryer's

Kyle Stegall also offered a stirring
rendition of Fleming's favorite song,
"Danny Boy."
Multiple speakers mentioned
Fleming's preference for reaching
out to people over meals, for exam-
ple his preference for discussing
important topics with colleagues
over breakfast and inviting the staff
of The Michigan Daily over for din-
ner with him and his wife, despite
the publication's criticism of his
administration.
"It was a way of demonstrating
that although our roles were adver-
sarial, he didn't take it personally,"
said Laura Berman, a columnist for
The Detroit News who served as co-
editor of The Michigan Daily's Sun-
day Magazine in 1975.
Fittingly, Fleming's habit of writ-
ing his speeches in abbreviated form
on table napkins just before he deliv-
ered them drew hearty laughs from
the audience.
"I'm not sure if the Clements
Library archives the presidents'
speeches, but if it does, there's a box
of table napkins with his words on
them in there," said former regent
Nellie Varner (D-Detroit).
Varner spoke fondly of Fleming's
tremendous support for her dur-
ing her rise through the University
administration to her position as a
regent, which, she said, was espe-
cially valuable because of the lack of
mentors for professional women at
the time.
"He said, 'One day, I'm going to
teach you how to run an organiza-
tion. It doesn't matter how large it is
or how small it is - you're the same
person,'"Varner said.
Prior to her stint as a regent,
Fleming also appointed Varner as
the University's first affirmative
action officer in 1972 - a gesture
Varner said helped pave the way for
future female and minority admin-
what (the Daily) meant. I really
don't know," Cunningham said.
However, Cunningham said later
in yesterday's interview that the
proposed minutes weren't released
because the staff member who
handles the regents minutes was
out of the office and that no one in
the Office of the Vice President and
Secretary of the University was in a
position to determine whether ornot
the document could be released.
"It's a very small office. They
would be released," Cunningham
said. "There must have been a mis-
understanding because (the staff
member who handles regents meet-
ing minutes) wasn't there."
"Frankly, no one ever asks for
them," Cunningham continued.
"What people do ask is, 'What hap-
pened?' and then we always say
what happened."
The December meeting of the
Board of Regents included several
routine items - all of which were
approved - including renovations
to Couzens Hall, renaming the
University's Women's Hospital and
sending an annual appropriations
request to the state.
Asked whether any back up plan
exists for handling requests in the
absence of the assistant secretary of
the University, Fitzgerald said yes-

istrators.
Duderstadt also remembered
Fleming as a comforting presence,
adding that Fleming gave him sound
advice when Duderstadt encoun-
tered protestors during his time as
president.
"'A pubhlc university president
should never regard the slings and
arrows launched by others as per-
sonal attacks; rather, critics are
simply angry with the institution,' "
Duderstadt said.
Fleming's children, Betsy DiMag-
gio, Nancy Reckford and James
Fleming, concluded the service
by giving their thanks and brief
thoughts on their father.
"He would have loved the humor-
ous tributes and kind words said
about him today - I think that's the
way we'd all like to remember him
here at Michigan," Reckford said,
gesturing to the stately picture of a
smiling Fleming and bright yellow
flowers at the center of the stage,
next to the podium.
After the memorial, several Uni-
versity administrators who attended
the event reflected on Fleming's
commitment to the University.
In an interview after the event,
Provost Teresa Sullivan praised
Fleming for his widespread impact
on future University administra-
tors.
"I think he was an inspiration for
other presidents and not just for the
people here at Michigan," Sullivan
said. "He was a man of integrity, and
I hope I carry that with me."
A student at the University while
Fleming was president, E. Royster
Harper, vice president for student
affairs, said she thoroughly enjoyed
the memorial service.
"It was very moving. He was
everything they've said he was,
and I remember because he was my
president," Harper said.
terday that he believed there was.
"I'm sure there's a back-up plan
for (when the staff member is out
of the office), but keep in mind
that nobody asks for the minutes,"
Fitzgerald said. "When that spe-
cific request came in there wasn't
really a back-up plan because we
never get any requests for the min-
utes."
"This request had never come
up that anyone can remember, of
asking for a copy of the minutes,"
Fitzgerald continued. "Even though
we have a process and a procedure,
with (the staff member) being out
this wasn't part of (the staff mem-
ber's) backup normal protocol.
Cunningham said she would be
"shocked" ifa similar situation hap-
pened in the future.
"Maybe people are going to
start asking for the minutes. I don't
know," she said.
"I'm sure if they do, we'll have
them ready."
However, Cunningham said no
plans were underway to prepare
for a similar situation - should
someone else request a copy of the
minutes when the staff member
who handles the regents minutes is
gone.
"They're staying with the same
thing," Cunningham said.

tal markets and the public policy
implications, she wrote.
AccountingProf.WilliamLanen,
who is also chair of the Account-
ing Department, said though the
department doesn't have courses
that relate to the specific events of
the recession, accounting courses
are now taking a new approach to
traditional accounting concepts.
Ina Masters of Accounting class,
students are introduced to specific
material but also hear from alum-
nae guest speakers who can offer
insight into the current financial
situation and provide examples
from their own careers in account-
ing, Lanen said.
Masters of Accounting students
were offered a chance to travel to
Washington D.C. last academic
year - with support from the
accounting firm Ernst and Young
- to speak with those involved in
financial regulations, accounting
standards and economic legisla-
tion, Lanen said.
"It gives them a background
beyond the technical textbook type
of learning to kinds of institutional
issues that arise and the kinds of
pressures that the accounting pro-
fession is under," Lanen said.
In order to teach his students
about the tangible effects of the
recession, Gerald Meyers, a lec-
turer in organizational behavior
and human resource management
in the Business School, brings
in CEOs as guest speakers to his
leadership and crisis management
course.
Meyers said using the financial
crisis as a teaching tool is "not only
valuable, it's necessary."
"It colors everything that's been
going on in the business world and
it's changed our emphasis consid-
erably," he said.
Norman Bishara, assistant pro-
fessor of business law and ethics,
teaches both BBA and MBA classes
dealing with ethics and law in the
business world. He said he hasn't
added specific topics or readings to
the courses regarding the financial
crisis, but the topic presents itself
because it is often of interest to stu-
dents.
In his classes, which focus on
law, Bishara draws on poor deci-
sions made by financial profession-
als and the ensuing economic crisis
as examples of ethics in business.
"You can also use it as a teach-
ing tool in the teachable moments

to talk about how problems could
have been avoided and how some of
them are related to simple business
ethics problems that are as simple
as people engaging in greed or
people violating the law and com-
mitting fraud and that sort of cor-
ruption," he said.
The financialcrisiswas aplanned
topic of discussion in Finance 300
last semester, but classes didn't
have time to cover it, though it was
listed as the subject of the last lec-
ture on the syllabus.
While he didn't get to this lec-
ture because of timing and prepa-
ration for student's interviews,
Ing-Haw Cheng, assistant profes-
sor of finance said that he tried
to incorporate the topic into his
lecture materials whenever the
opportunity presented itself.
"The main theme that I tried to
push in the class is that one of the
approximate reasons that you can
think of behind the financial crisis
is maybe too strong of a belief of the
models we used in finance," Cheng
said.
"I tried to teach my students some
evidence as to kind of recognize
some situations where market effi-
ciency may be breaking down and
hence, the tools I'm trying to teach
them might not be the most appli-
cable in those situations," he said.
BBA junior Jason Raymond said
that while these concepts were
touched upon in class, he would
have liked to hear more about the
crisis.
"I think it's very important to
address a lot of the current issues
going on in our economy," Ray-
mond said. "And, it was unfortu-
nate that we didn't cover it as much
as we were originally promised, I
guess."
While Raymond believes that
the crisis is an important con-
cept to learn about, he added, "It's
important to cover the (course)
material as well so that you can
better understand the financial cri-
sis or the mortgage crisis or what-
ever other crisis are out there in the
financial sector."
Jim Cooper, a BBA junior and
recent student in Finance 300 said
he doesn't think it's the Business*
School's obligation to teach students
about the financial crisis. He said
students should be learning about
the topic by reading. news sources
like The Wall Street Journal.
"The financial crisis was just one
more historical, financial event. It's
just like the Great Depression, or
when the stock market crashed in
'87," Cooper said. "I think it's one

Thursday, January 21, 2010 - 5A
of those things thatyoujust needto
learn about on your own, especially
if you want to work in finance so,
it's not really one of those academ-
ic things I think that you should
devote a class to."
Not only is the recent financial
crisis drastically altering class
at the Business School, it's also
impacting the way instructors in
other parts of the University teach
their courses, especially those
related to public policy.
Kathryn Dominguez, professor
of public policy and economics, is
currently teaching three courses
that directly relate to the financial
situation both in the United States
and abroad. One of these courses is
a macroeconomics class that exam-
ines the implications of economic
policy putinto effect in the wake of
the crisis.
Because of the financial crisis,
Dominguez said the way that she
discusses the United States and
its monetary policy in relation to
other countries around the world
will change this semester, as it is a
telling example of a country in eco-
nomic shambles.
"In most cases when I've taught
this course in the past, we've
looked at developing countries as
our example because the U.S. has
been kind of boring in terms of
policy," she said. "We don't tend to
have very large changes in macro-
policy, or we haven't in the last
decade or so, but now the U.S. will
be a very interesting example to
look at."
Dominguezsaidthefederalstim-
ulus package is one fiscal policy her
class will be tracking because of its
importance as a real world example
of the efficacy ofgovernmentpolicy
that relates to the economy.
Daniel Silverman, associate
professor of economics, used the
financial crisis in his government
expenditures course last semes-
ter as the "extended example" for
market failure and government
response, and said he thought stu-
dents appreciated learning about
such a relevant topic.
"Speaking for myself at least,
not for the students, it was a ter-
rific opportunity to really put the
ideas that we were working on in
the class to useful application,"
Silverman said. "And based on the
student evaluations, the written
comments, it seemed like it was a
big hit. I may not have taught it all
that well, but students really appre-
ciated this opportunity to think
about the crisis and learn more
about it."



HAITI
From Page 1A
port the relief efforts.
Student organizations are col-
lecting money to donate to the
ravaged country, while the Univer-
sityofMichiganHealth Systemand
members of the medical communi-
ty are donating supplies and medi-
cal expertise to Haiti. In addition,
the University's Office of Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs recently
created an organization - called
the Michigan Haiti Earthquake
Action Relief Team (M-HEART)
- to unite the efforts from various
student and faculty groups across
campus.
The Health System began col-
lecting medical supplies last
Friday to be sent to Haiti in con-
junction with Detroit-based char-
ity World Medical Relief.
UMHS also plans to use its Sur-
vival Flight Services, a program
containing 3 helicopters readily
available in case of medical emer-
gencies, to transport supplies,
patients and UMHS faculty to and

from Haiti, according to a Jan. 15,
2010 Health System press release.
Tony Denton, chief operating
officer of the University of Michi-
gan Hospitals & Health Centers,
is in charge of the UHMS relief
efforts and wrote in the statement
that the Health System is doing
everything it can to aid those
affected by the natural disaster.
"The Health System communi-
ty, along with the rest of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, is eager to
extend its reach and help the vic-
tims of the earthquake in Haiti,"
he wrote in the release.
Students are also organizing
various fundraisers and supply
drives to donate to the country.
The Latino Student Organization
collected donations in the Diag
on Tuesday to donate to the Red
Cross. LSO collected about $580,
which will then be matched by a
corporation, according to Steven
Benavides, the external relations
chair for LSO.
Members of other student
organizations, like Sigma Kappa
and Alpha Chi Omega sororities,
have encouraged their members

to text HAITI to the number
90999, which will add $10 to their
phone bills to be donated to the
Red Cross to assist the recovery
in Haiti.
Amidtheseefforts, aS.9-magni-
tude aftershock struck the nation
yesterday, causing further dam-
age to the already battered capi-
tal, according to The Associated
Press. The original earthquake hit
Port-au-Prince on Jan. 12.
Despite relief efforts by nations
around the world, hundreds of
thousands of people remain home-
less, according to the AP.
U.S. military personnel are
already in Haiti helping with the
relief effort, according to the AP
and a total of 16,000 members of
the military are expected to be
in the country by the end of the
week.
John Holmes, humanitarian
chief for the United Nations, told
reporters that 2 million Haitians
will need food and aid for the next
six months, according to the AP.
- The Associated Press
contributed to this report.

analysis showed that the HCZ
schools are successful at boosting
math and language arts achieve-
ment in elementary school children
and math achievement in middle
school students.
"I feel like we've found a cure for
a disease that's been plaguing us...
There's something special going on
in the HCZ, but I don't really know
what," Fryer said.
He said he couldn't definitively
saywhetherschoolsalonecanbridge
the achievement gap or if communi-
ty involvement is necessary but only
that community programs alone
are ineffective. The "magic bullet,"
Fryer said, would have to be a com-
bination of factors and that it would
not be easy to manufacture.
Geoffrey Canada, the president

and chief executive officer for HCZ,
combined many strategies to posi-
tively impact the children in "the
Zone," Fryer said. He added that
the number of strategies make it
difficult to pinpoint which ones are
most effective.
Fryer said, to get closer to a real
formula, he would like to ask Can-
ada to suggest four or five of the
HCZ initiatives that he thinks are
especially important, apply them
to a public school and observe the
effects.
Fryer said the task ahead is
going to be arduous, but he remains
optimistic that there is something-
definitive that is responsible for the
success of the HCZ.
"I think it's.too convenient to say
this is some miracle," he said.

'Defense' is the
word for ' in
ton ight's game '

Rust's play evokes the past

In last meeting,
No. 5 Ohio State
inched past Blue
By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
When Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth pictures the women's bas-
ketball team's defense, he wants
to imagine a solid block. Bors-
eth said his team's defense has,
at times, reminded him of swiss
cheese. And its
holes represent Ohio State
a lot of gaping
problems. at Michigan
Michigan is Matchup: Ohio
2-5 in the Big Ten State 19-1;
(10-7 overall) Michigan 10-7
and 1-1 at home. When: Tonight

that record, the

teristically tight Live Blog:
in defending michigandaily.
its home court corn
against No. 5
Ohio State tonight.
Borseth knows the team needs
to learn how to respond when
opponents make mid-game
adjustments. It's something they
couldn't do against Wisconsin in
an ugly 20-point road loss on Jan.
10.
"In the second half, they just
0 diced us up (defensively)." Bors-
eth said after the loss in Madison.
"They changed their configura-
tion in the second half. We didn't
adjust to it, and that hurt us."
- And against a team as strong
as Ohio State, the Wolverines will
need an extra effort to put togeth-
er a full 40 minutes of defense.
Good teams will take advantage
ofthe holes in the Michigan defense
until it turns into that "solid block
of cheese", and the Wolverines
haven't played an entire Big Ten
gane of great defense yet.;
Any hopes of a mid-conference
winning streak were put on hold
after a loss to Indiana in their last
game on Jan.14. That doesn't bode
well for a young team desperate
for a momentum swing.
Against the Hoosiers, the Wol-
verines trailed in the first half,
allowing 40 points before the
break, after which they buckled
down and came out strong defen-
sively in the second half. They
held Indiana to just 23 points in
the final 20 minutes. And if they
had made a last-second layup that

rolled out of the rim, they would
have tied the game and forced
overtime. It was their unusually
strong and inspired defense that
gave them a chance to win.
And if Michigan is going to beat
the Buckeyes (7-0 Big Ten, 10-1
overall) tonight, the Wolverines
absolutely must lock down one end
of the court.
But that's easier said than done.
The Wolverines' holey defense
is prohibiting them from beating
mediocre teams - and for a team
historically strong on the defen-
sive end like Ohio State, that is
worrisome.
"If we get stops on our defense
then it leads to ... us pushing the
ball and making baskets," senior
center Krista Phillips said. "We
really need to focus and get stops
so we can push the ball and get out
in the front court and play the way
that we are used to playing."
In Michigan's first meeting
with Ohio State in Columbus, the
Wolverines had a chance to win
but couldn't capitalize.
Late-game defensive stops
would have made the difference in
the 59-56 loss.
"Obviously, I think we could
have done better on the defensive
end," sophomore forward Carmen
Reynolds said after the Jan. 3 loss.
"We could've gotten more stops, so
we got to look to do that in the next
game."
And true to their word, they did
improve defensively in their next
game.
In what became their first
sweep of the season, the Wolver-
ines held Iowa to below 30 percent
shooting to defend their home
court for the win.
"At the end of the game, we have
to come up with defensive stops,"
junior guard Veronica Hicks said
after the loss to the Buckeyes. "I
think we are putting ourselves
in a position where we are stop-
ping them during the game, but
a couple ofgymgs likethe North-
western game ... and also at Ohio
State, we just didn't get the stop.
It left us with a three-point deficit.
Those two games were kind of the
same, and they ended up kind of
the same."
Especially for a team with an
offense is fueled bX defensive
stops, turning swiss into solid is a
must if this team is going to start
winning again.
And in tonight's home-court
match-up with the Buckeyes,
Michigan has a chance to prove
that it can do that against the best.

By MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Editor
They were standout penalty kill-
ers for the Michigan hockey team.
Two former and one current Wol-
verine - each responsible for the
minor detailsthat didn'tjump out of
the box score at the end of the night.
From blocking shots and shut-
ting down the opponents' top line
to winning timely face-offs with
seconds left on the clock, Michi-
gan assistant coach Mel Pearson
recalled a duo of past Wolverines as
a perfect comparison to Michigan's
prototypical defensive forward
today - junior Matt Rust.
"(Rust) is a cross between Jed
Ortmeyer and Dwight Helminen,"
Pearson said. "Dwight was a great
skater, really good defensive player.
And Jed was just unbelievable -
blocked shots, put his body on the
line, and Rusty does that."
Both Ortmeyer and Helminen
are still in the process of establish-
ing themselves in the NHL as Rust
leads a Wolverine team that is try-
ing to make it to the NCAA Tour-
nament for the 20th-straight year.
The two older Michigan products
played for Wolverine coach Red
Berenson in the early 2000s. Ort-
meyer graduated from the Univer-
sity in 2003 and Helminen left after
his junior season a year later.
And Rust, a product of the U.S.
National Team Development Pro-
gram in Ann Arbor, has shown a
multitude of similarities to these
past Wolverines.
"It starts with hockey sense and
hockey smarts," Pearson said. "He
anticipates plays instead of just

ARIEL BOND/Daily

Junior Matt Rust is second on the team in scoring this season with seven points in his last seven contests.

reacting to them, and he's got that
bulldog mentality on the ice."
With just under five minutes left
in the second period of Saturday's
game against Alaska, Rust wheeled
his way behind the Nanooks' net,
looking for freshman Kevin Lynch
in the low slot. Rust spun on a dime,
in order to throw a forehand pass
out to a wide-open Lynch, who
then flipped the puck over goalten-
der Scott Greenharn's glove.
Rust then won a faceoff in the
Nanook zone with about three min-
utes remaining in the game. Junior
defenseman Chad Langlais cor-
ralled the puck and slid a wrist shot
on the ice that made its way past
Greenham's five-hole, capping off
a two-goal comeback to force the
game into overtime.
The two plays, though maybe

minor in the scope of the whole
season, are what the Wolverines
need more of, not only from Rust,
but from the entire roster. Despite
Rust's performance in recent
games, coach -Red Berenson was
quick to note how his first-line cen-
ter should have more goals at this
point in the season.
"He didn'thave as good an offen-
sive weekend (againstAlaska) as he
could have, because that line (of
freshman Kevin Lynch, Rust and
junior Carl Hagelin) generated
some two-on-ones," Berenson said.
"He had three glorious chances to
score this weekend, and if he had
a really good weekend, he would
have scored on those chances."
The Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
native is second on the team in
scoring, with seven points in his

last seven games. Rust could beone
of the leading forces necessary for
a late Wolverine surge with just six
weeks left in conference play.
But it could be Rust's loose
demeanor and carefree mental-
ity that has had one of the big-
gest impacts on the Wolverines.
The ability for Rust to maintain a
positive, upbeat atmosphere in the
locker room, especially during a
roller-coaster season, is a welcome
contribution to any team. And no
one would know Rust's charac-
ter better than teammate and best
friend, junior Louie Caporusso.
"He's a funny kid," Caporusso
said. "Me and him can go all day
and talk about whatever and have a
laugh about it. ... He's a great danc-
er. He can dance to Fergie like no
one else."

Blue squeaks by 19th-ranked Spartans

By STEPHEN NESBITT
Daily Sports Writer
The scene was oddly famil-
iar. A Michigan gymnast landed
her final jump, threw up her
hands, and flashed a smile to the
applauding crowd, only to be
crushed several moments later
with a mediocre score, just as it
had happened several times ear-
lier in the night.
Nevertheless, the 15th-ranked
Wolverines (2-0 Big Ten, 3-0 over-
all) needed their final two floor
performances - phenomenal runs
by freshman Natalie Beilstein and
junior Kylie Botterman - to secure
a slim 194.20-193.75 victory over
No. 19 Michigan State at Crisler
Arena.
Sure, Michigan came out with
the win, but the Wolverines know
there's much room for improve-
ment.
"We improved in some areas,
and we had some mistakes," senior

Sarah Curtis said. "Overall, it was
good for us to get out there. The
more we have under our belt, the
better we get at doing them, and we
get the nervous shakes."
But before the team makes any
drastic changes, it must consider
the conservative officiating.
"I thought the judging was pret-
ty tight tonight, and it was a little
frustrating," Michigan coach Bev
Plocki said. "Bot we'trgoing, to
have that, and I guess it's better
that we find out right now what
kind of stuff they're accepting so
we can go back in practice, and
see what we can do to get higher
scores."
The Spartans (2-1, 5-1) saw their
share of questionable scores, but
while they struggled in the open-
ing acts on the uneven bars, their
proficiency on the floor exercise
and on the balance beam pulled
them five one hundredths of a
point behind Michigan after three
events.

While the Michigan fans roared
at the judges after each controver-
sial score went up, the meet was
closer than necessary due to Wol-
verines' mistakes, according to
Plocki, who pointed to three falls
as major contributors to the small
margin of victory.
"I'm obviously disappointed
with the falls we had on beam,"
Plocki said. "We train beam in
practice like we're champs, and
you can see by the scores of the
kids who hit that we are a very
good beam team, but sometimes
when you have a fall ... itputs a lot
of pressure on people coming up
later in the lineup."
on a night when tumbles and
low scores plagued the Wolver-
ines, Curtis was definitely a leader,
winning the individual bar and
beam events with totals of 9.825
and 9.875 respectively, as well as
earning the all-around award with
a 39.275.
"We expect (Sarah) to do that in

her role, as experienced as she is,"
Plocki said. "We need to be able to
count on her in pressure situations,
and tonight she caine through for
us."
Another outstanding performer
was freshman Natalie Beilstein,
who made another bid for Big Ten
Freshman of the Week honors with
a second terrific meet. Beilstein
took the vault with a 9.875 and tied
Botterman with a floor routine
pegged at 9.825.
"It has been wonderful to see
that (Natalie) is coming out and
coming into her own and compet-
ing the way that she's trained,"
Plocki said. " She isa freshman, and
while most freshmen are uptight,
they're nervous, they're scared,
she just goes out there and lets it all
hang out."
Curtis expects the team to use
this meet as the building block for
a stronger showing, especially with
a matchup against No. 9 Nebraska
looming.

For Friday, Jan. 22, 2010
ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
This is an emotional day for you
because the Moon is in your sign. This
makes you impatient with others. Guard
against knee-jerk reactions.
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
Perhaps because of chaotic activities
at home (or for other reasons), you need
a breather! Try to get some quiet time
just for yourself to work or relax alone.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
You might have a meaningful conver-
sation with a female acquaintance today.
Or the conversation could be competi-
tive and slightly challenging. Who
knows?
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)'
Some aspect of your private life sud-
denly will be made public today.
Whatever occurs might put you on the
defensive. Actually, it's small potatoes.
Relax.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Try to do something different today.
You're restless, you want some adven-
ture and you want to learn something
new! Go someplace you've never been
behore. Talk to people from other cul-
tures and difterent backgrounds.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Although you're focused on red-tape
matters about insurance, inheritances,
shared property and banking, do not
make any permanent decisions today.
Wait until tomorrow.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Because the Moon is opposite your
sign today, you will have to go more than
halfway when dealing with others. Don't

worry. In two weeks, people will have to
go more than halfway dealing with you!
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
You have an urge to get better organ-
ized today. However, this is a poor day to
shop. It's a better day to just putter and
put things in tidy, neat piles.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22to Dec. 21)
This is a fun-loving, goofy day. It's the
perfect day to kick back and relax, if you
can. Enjoy playful times with children.
Watch some sports. Grab a movie.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Your thoughts turn to home, family
and domestic matters today. Discussions
with family members might take a sur-
prising turn. (They'll certainly be frank.)
However, avoid important decisions
today.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20to Feb. 10)
This is a busy day with errands, short
trips and possibly sbopping. Actually,
its a poor day for shopping. Above alt,
keep your receipts.
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
You might be concerned with cash
flow and financial matters today. Guard
against errors or loss. This is not a good
day for major expenditures.
YOU BORN TODAY Even though
you have an mtense energy, you know
how to keep it under control. This makes
you appear sophisticated and detached.
(You are anything but.) In fact, you are
quite impulsive! You need encourage-
ment from others. You like life to be
exciting. Your year ahead could possibly
be one the most powerful years of your
life! Dream big!

Michigan surrenders
late lead to Badgers in
must-win road game

'A'must learn to forget in ,
order to salvage season

Loss means 11
straight years of
defeat for 'M'
at Kohl Center
By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
MADISON - The Michigan
men's basketball team entered
yesterday's game against Wiscon-
sin with its eye on a few streaks.
The Wolverines looked to add a
third-
straight WISCONSIN 54
win and MICHIGAN 48
turn their
recent stretch into an official win
streak. They wanted to break the
Badgers' decade-long win streak
in the Kohl Center, which would
mean Michigan's first victory in
Madison since 1999. And perhaps
most important, the Wolverines
wanted to keep No. 18 Wisconsin
on a cold streak, especially after
the Badgers couldn't score in the
first five minutes of the game.
But Michigan's last five minutes
mirrored Wisconsin's icy start, and
the Badgers rode a 15-5 run in the
game's final stretch to beatthe Wol-
verines 54-48. Suddenly, Michi-
gan's potential win streak morphed
into a gut-wrenching loss.
At the end of the night, it didn't
matter that Michigan had an
11-point lead over Wisconsin twice
during the game. It didn't mat-
ter that senior forward DeShawn
Sims had a monster 23-point,
13-rebound performance. And it
didn't matter that the Wolver-
ines outplayed a tough, talented,
nationally-ranked Badger squad
for 35 minutes.
"We've been here before, on
the road and hanging with a good
team," freshman guard Darius
Morris said after the game. "Really,
we're over the moral victories. We
need to get these wins. That's basi-
cally it."
In other words, victories - even
those that coaches call "moral" vic-
tories - don't end with players sit-

ting still in a silent postgame locker
room with their heads in their
hands.
"With four minutes to go, we're
leading the game and we can win
the game," Michigan coach John
Beilein said.
And that's perhaps the most
painful part for the Wolverines (3-3
Big Ten, 10-8 overall). They led the
Badgers (5-2, 15-4) from the first
moments of the game until Wiscon-
sin took its first lead with just 3:07
remaining in the contest.
But that was all the Badgers
needed.
"They slowly chipped away at
the lead," Morris said. "We had
control, but slowly they took it their
way. By the time they took it their
way, it just was too late for us to do
anything about it."
The Wolverines certainly tried,
though. Beilein called a couple of
timeouts late in the game to calm
down his squad. He attempted to
relax a team that appeared to tense
up as the Kohl Center crowd roared
itself back to life. His message was
simple.
"One timeout was, 'This is
where we really have to hunker
down and play defense,' " Beilein
said. "Then, I'm looking them in
the eyes and saying, 'When are you
going to step up and make an open
shot now?' Because all of the sud-
den, we went dry, and it just never
happened."
Basketball is a streaky sport, and
Michigan's ice-cold stretch came at
the worst time. During the game's
final five minutes, the Wolverines
made just one basket, and missed
nine.
"In every game, there are those
spells," Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan
said after the game.
He was lucky his team's spell
came early, and he was lucky his
team knew how to get out of its
funk. Ryan's teams are good at that
- they're 131-10 at the Kohl Center
during his tenure.
"They don't beat themselves, and
they didn't beat themselves today,"
Beilein said.
Teams like that keep streaks
alive.

After the game last night in 40
Madison, I found myself double-
checking that the maize jerseys
were Michigan, and the white ones
were Wis-
consin.
The Wol-
verines were
the ones tak-
ing advan-
tage of their
opponent's
missed shots.
They were JOE
the ones STAPLETON
grabbing
rebounds.
They were the ones playing suf-
focating defense and jumping out to
an early lead.
See, usually, it's the other way
around.
And if Wisconsin was Michigan,
the Badgers would have gotten
down on themselves after falling
behind, let their offense affecttheir
defense, and they would have lost.
But Wisconsin wasn't Michigan.
Wisconsin was Wisconsin, and the
Badgers played the final eight min-
utes of the game as if theytold them-
selves- "Dammit,we'reWisconsin!"
The Badgers woke up after a
3-pointer by Rob Wilson and from
there, they imposed their will on
the Wolverines. They decided that,
since they were having a bad shoot-
ing night, they would take it to the
post, which they did with alarming
success.
By the 4:04 mark, after two Bad-
ger layups and a tip-in, Wisconsin
had tied the game, and Michigan
had lost all momentum. The Wol-
verines became timid and settled
for outside jumpers instead of going senior DeSh
to the post, which had been work- Madison yes
ing all game.
That's the difference between letting its
teams like Wisconsin, which in the way
doesn't lose many Big Ten games That probl
at home, and teams like Michi- heads, and

"Through the Fire and Flames"
or "Sweet Child 0' Mine" or any-
thing even moderately close to
rock or heavy metal.
In the gray-carpeted, sterile
museum space, there is only one
song available to play on the con-
sole. The player is given just two
notes, which are strummed once
and then held over the span of sev-
eral minutes. The buttons' sound-
trails float ethereally down the
screen. A rugged, distorted elec-
tric guitar twang resonates in the
exhihit space.
The noise becomes increasingly
mocking as the player sits, fin-
gers unmoving on the fret hoard.
The game, "Frets on Fire," racks
up points over-enthusiastically:
2,000 then 3,000 and climbing.
In this game, any player with fin-
gers and a lick of patience will he
guaranteed to end the song with
thousands of points and the title

This song, as produced on
U"Frets on Fire," is a work titled
Composition #7 by Cory Arcangel,
ect Gallery whose exhibit, "Cory Arcangel:
unscri pted Creative Pursuits," is on display
at the UMMA Project Gallery
through April 11L
Arcangel himself is an artist at
nMy the forefront of the contemporary
digital and media-based art scene,
producing works that use and
examine mediums both cultur-
ally familiar and unfamiliar: Pho-
toshop, Guitar Hero-type games,
the Sony PlayStation, viral videos,
Maxell cassette tapes and kinetic
sculpture a la '90s store displays.
His works have been lauded by, as
well as displayed in, institutions
like The Guggenheim Museum,
the Museum of Modern Art and
the Whitney Museum of Ameri-
can Art in New York City.
Like Composition #7, the rest of
Arcangel's body of work currently
on display at UMMA analyzes the
expanses between concepts com-
monly seen as disparate - the
gray area between high and low
culture, the virtuosic and the ama-
teur, the popular and the obscure.
to these in-between spaces,
Arcangel finds a way of twist-
ing and playing with conceptions
of what art is and how it breaks
down. What kind of
Oart "belongs" in a
museum and what
kind would you find
in a working-class
living room?
Does "Guitar
Hero" belong
in an art gal-
lery? Does

Philip Glass belong in the living
room? Are the two groups mutu-
ally exclusive?
"(The exhibit) is more of afocus
on how expression happens in a
particular medium ... so all the
works you see are pivoted off of
traditional ways that these things
are traditionally used," Arcangel
said. "I'll look at the ways people
are using things and then look at
the medium and then try to find a
way in or out of it."
While it's assumed that "Gui-
tar Hero" is an outlet reserved for
popular guitar music, Arcangel's
Composition #7 undermines this
concept - Arcangel's two-note
song on 'Frets on Fire" is not a
haphazard creation, but an actual
musical piece titled "Composi-
tion 1960 #7," which was created
by renowned composer La Monte
Young in the 1960s.
The work itself is composed of
only a B and F# notes, together
creating a perfect fifth. in perfor-
mance, these notes were, accord-
ing to Young's instructions for
the piece, to be "held for a long
time."
Using the lens of something
as approachable and culturally
omnipresent as "Guitar Hero,"
Arcangel plays with the audi-
ence's field of interest by mix-
ing the familiar with culturally
obscure concept art.
"The pieces present a mix of
high and low fashion," said Jacob
Proctor, associate curator of mod-
ern and ontemporary art at the
UMMA, who also curated Arcan-
gel's exhibit.
"That kind of mash-up goes
back to some of the first steps I've
ever seen in (Arcangel's) Beach
Boys vs. Geto Boys mash-up,"
Proctor said, referring to a 2004
piece in which Arcangel mixed
two culturally separate songs.
In that piece, the Beach Boys'
sunny rock was not positioned to
rile up the aggressive rap of the
GetoeBoys. Instead, thertwo groups
were integrated with one another
into a single track, displaying con-
sistencies beyond the second word
in both of the groups' names.
These mash-ups created by
Arcangel also include his perfor-
mance of "Last Night I Had the
Strangest Dream" (which can be
found on YouTube), a song writ-
ten by anti-war protester Ed
McCurdy in i950 and covered by
artists including Simon and Gar-
funkel and Joan Baez.
In Arcangel's recording, he
accompanies repetitive acoustic
guitar strums with his own auto-
tuned vocals, presenting a strange
intermingling of sincere lines
like "I dreamed the world had
all agreed / to put an end to war"

with the superficially polished
club sound of the past decade.
The work brings together two
genres that would seem to butt
heads - if not completely contra-
dict each other - in a way that's
not only coherent but oddly pal-
pable in the piece as well.
* FROM YOUTUBE *
r TO THE GALLERY*
Arcangel's focus on music-ori-
ented pieces stems from his Bach-
elor of Music degree from Oberlin
Conservatory in Ohio. He uses his
experience with music to explore
different ways in which cultures
can be combined.
"Art was learning about music.
And when I started to make art,
I realized I just made the art-
work based off of things I made in
music," Arcangel said. "Because
modern music - it's conceptual
art."
Also on display in the Project
Gallery is Arcangel's work, titled
Drei Klavierstuke, Op. it, which
was made by editing and splic-
ing various home videos of cats
playing pianos. He put the video
together so that each of the notes
hit by a cat in the final video is
in exact alignment with a note
played in Drei Klavierstuke, Op. 11,
a 20th-century musical piece by
composer Arnold Schoenberg.
Schoenberg's composition
eschews traditional Western har-
monies in favor of atonality, creat-
ing a piece that sounds erratic and
tuneless in comparisoncto contem-
porary pop music.
"Atonal music sounds like cats
walking on pianos. It's an elabo-
rate punch line, the whole piece,"
Arcangel said.
Schoenberg's entire piece does
sound like the random plunkings
of paws on piano keys. However,
when played alongside Arcangel's
cat remix, the exactness of Arcan-
gel's viral video recapitulation of
the piece is strikingly precise and
formulated.
"I. knew people loved cats
enough that I could do what is
considered one of the most diffi-
cult pieces in music ever," Arcan-
gel said. "And I knew the cats were
powerful enough -3I knew people
love cats enough - to provide (the
video) with a real mechanism for
its own dispersion into culture."
Upon the initial release of
Arcangel's Drei Klavierstuke, Op.
11 on the Internet, the entirety
of the composition, contained in
three videos, was linked by a wide
range of interest websites, from
novelty blogs to museum websites
to cat and animal lovers' sites,
including CuteOverload.com. The

FOOD WARS

MARNEE THAI
This upscale dig nestled on the corner
of Main and Williams puts its own unique
spin on Pad Thai, but it's hard to tell just
what that spin is. There's a mysterious
blend of curries and a less eggy flavor
than you might be used to. But the gener-
ous portions of tofu and green onions hit
the spot, as does the separate dish of pea-
nuts that you can spread at your leisure.
NOODLES AND CO.
Youknow you're not going to get truly
great Pad Thai from a place that also
makes Macaroni and Cheese and Penne
Rosa. While Noodles certainly serves up
some good eating, its Pad Thai doesn't
have that Southeast Asian blast of fla-
vor necessary for a quality dish. You get
watery, bland noodles with no spice.

- mw -

NO THAI!
No Thai! makes a valiant effort for
authentic Pad Thai. While clearly Ameri-
canized, the dish packs in an array of
tasty, fresh ingredients. For the iron-
mouthed, try challenging the spiciness
spectrum- No Thai! will win. The heavy,
extremely oily sauce goes down wonder-
fully, but then regret starts to take hold. A
satisfying - but physicallytaxing - meal.
SIAM CUISINE
In a restaurant that's also a family
home where Thai TV shows are blaring in
the background, you know you're getting
the authentic experience. And the Pad
Thaihas awarm, hearty, homemade taste
to match. With just the right balance of
peanut, egg and spice, it's well worth the
awkwardness of eating in a living room.

AND THE WINNER IS: SIAM CUISINE
CAMPUS CLASH
LAST WEEK'S RESULTS:
Teresa Sullivan strikes a ninja pose as John Beilein looks up from his Pad
Thai, weilding his stainless steel spork. Sullivan lunges in for a nunchuck to
the neck. Beilein diverts the blow with his epic spork. He pulls a smoke bomb
from his Pad Thai and throws it at Sullivan's feet. Blinded, Sullivan can't
retaliate. Beilein sporks his way to an ugly but well deserved win.
WINNER: JOHN BEILEIN

Creativity, on our terms

The University enjoys

cept is the vari-

has to offer. To '-

diversity, the BLOCK
University, like - -
many others across the nation,
has a set of distribution require-
ments. And among the categories
that can fill these distribution
requirements is a little gem called
"creative expression."
Now, I love the idea of creative
expression, which might be why
* I've met the requirement several
times over. The fact that I was
once a creative writing major cer-
tainly contributed to this redun-
dancy. But the first class I took
that met this requirement was an
RC drama class. It was small, but
I really enjoyed the class and the
group of students in it. That is,
once that one annoying guy left.
And this is really the story of
that one annoying guy, and the
annoying guys in arts classes
everywhere. This snarky little
devil clearly had no appreciation
for or interest in drama. When
we went around in a circle the
first day, introducing ourselves
and explaining why we were tak-
ing the class, he openly admit-
ted that he just needed creative
expression credits. He spoke
arrogantly, as though creativity
was beneath him and that anyone
who willingly took a drama class
was a wannabe with misguided
priorities. One more class session
and he was gone.

guy with the Tickets from $18
scraggly beard,
the eloquent
rhetorician, the Great Emancipa-
tor, the courageous man who led
us through the Civil War - per-
haps the most pivotal event in
United States history.
Bill T. Jones tells us to stop
thinking and start imagining.
The Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane
Dance Company will be present-
ing its acclaimed work, "Fondly
Do We Hope... Fervently Do We
Pray," during the University of
Michigan's 24th Annual MLK
Symposium tomorrow. Directed
by acclaimed choreographer and
2007 Tony Award-winner Bile T.
Jones, the engaging dance theater
performance centers on our 16th
president.
"Fondly Do We Hope... Fervent-
ly Do We Pray" transports us to a
moment in time when there was
much unrest and uncertainty in
the United States. Through the use
of dance, text, recitations, projec-
tions and music ranging from folk
to gospel, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie
Zane Dance Company aims to cre-
ate a multimedia performance that
captures the turmoil and emotion
of Lincoln's era.
In particular, dance is uti-
lized frequently and effectively
throughout the piece, transform-
ing the performance into much
more than a typical musical the-
ater routine.
Professor Robin Wilson, an
Associate Professor of Dance in
the School of Music, Theatre &

Dance, explained why dance may
be especially effective in this per-
formance, while giving a dance
primer to students who are not
familiar with the art form.
"I try to use poetry as a refer-
ence or analogy for people try-
ing to understand modern dance.
When you hear poetry, reading
it doesn't really do it. You have to
hear it. And it's not linear. It trig-
gers images ... for an overall feel
that affects you," Wilson said.
"And I think modern dance cho-
reography, and dance choreogra-
phy in general, tends to do that.
It's usually not a narrative as in a
play or musical theater, where you
would have a dance number that
kind of carries the story along just
like a song would.
"It really is this idea of put-
ting the moving body in relation
to other bodies and maybe film
to evoke an image and provoke
thought," he added.
Wilson also applauds Bill T.
Jones for taking a distinctive
approach to choreographing the
dance numbers in "Fondly Do We
Hope... Fervently Do We Pray."
"(Jones) has a process where
he collaborates heavily with his
dancers," Wilson said. "Rather
than saying 'Okay, these are the
steps; I've made them up before;
I want you to learn the steps,
and then I want you to execute
the steps the way I want it; and
here's the music; and here's the
costumes,' it's much more collab-
orative, where he walks in and he
asks questions. And then out of
those answers, movement ques-
tions are presented. And when
those movement questions are
posed, the dancers then create
movement answers. Out of those
movement answers, he then, with
that material, creates a piece."
Starting with the title, Jones
aims to portray Lincoln in a man-
ner that extends beyond the his-
torical figure, and focuses instead
on the man behind the history.
"Lincoln is a story we tell
each other. A generation or two
ago, schoolchildren would have
learned the Gettysburg Address,
the second inaugural of which the
'Fondly' reference comes," Jones
explains in a video on his dance
company's website.
"I was gently mocking what
was true about Lincoln being a
series of lines, a series of speech-
es, a series of biographical points.
I was using 'Fondly' in a warm
but somewhat ironic way to talk
about Lincoln being reduced to a

few simple tropes," Jones says in
the video.
The title may hold ulterior
meanings as well. University
Musical Society Student Advisory
Committee member Sayan Blsat-
tachary offers a different take on
the title.
"It says 'Fondly Do We Hope...
Fervently Do We Pray.' Those
three dots - what are those three
dots? It doesn't say 'Fondly Do
We Hope, Fervently Do We Pray.'
Could have, but it doesn't," said
Bhattacharyya. "What do those
three dots suggest? Something
that is undecided, that is maybe
even a little hesitant. Someone
is saying 'Fondly We Hope,' and
maybe he's not quite sure that
hope will be realized.
"That word 'hope' is immense-
ly suggestive. There is a moment
of hesitation, pause, uncertainty,
and above all, doubt within that
hope that has been generated
fondly. Fondly here doesn't mean
the English word 'fond,' like 'I am
fond of that person.' Fondly here
is an Old English word that means
'naively,' 'innocently,' " said Bhat-
tacharyya.
Wilson hopes the audience
will come away with not only an
appreciation of dance but also a
better understanding of one of
the greatest men to ever claim the
presidency.
"Here is this man who sym-
bolized a lot of hope for people
(and) was controversial," Wilson
said. "What lessons can we learn
from this very, very thoughtful
man who was thrust into his-
tory? What were the questions he
asked and how would we respond
to those same questions? How do
our answers shape the way we try
to make our world a better one
and be better citizens?"
In a similar vein, the Compa-
ny's Associate Artistic Director
Janet Wong encourages students
to come to the performance to
not only learn about Lincoln but
also about themselves. And she
emphasized that any hesitant
students put off by the "dance
theater" label will find the show
more accessible than they may
expect.
"I think it's a piece that has
many levels to it. It's also a piece
that is very accessible. For exam-
ple, if you watch or look at an
abstract painting, you go 'huh?'"
Wong said. "But this is a piece that
has text, that has characters, that
has music. ... You can even hum the

videos on YouTube currently have more than 88,000
hits collectively.
"Cats are a magnet, really. Everyone likes to see
cats on video. Especially on pianos," Arcangel said.
This odd "human short-circuit," according to
Arcangel, where an unsettling majority of people
enjoy cats on film (the artist even mentioned that one
of Edison's first-ever films from the late 1800s depicts
two cats boxing), allows for a considerable bridge
between so-called pop culture and art culture.
"The Internet opens up audiences for everything.
Now everything has an audience so people don't think
(the split between genres) is so black and white,"
Arcangel said.
The idea of opening up spaces - especially within
museums, where galleries are traditionally separat-
ed from one another - and provoking interactions'
between disparate areas of interest is a concept
Arcangel's works seem to invite.
"Going to (Arcangel's) gallery openings is much
different than going to other gallery openings," Proc-
tor said.
"It's double the audience - you have all the art
world people and then you have all the Internet and
computer world people."
Proctor, who since graduate school has been fol-
lowing Arcangel's work, said that it is Arcangel's
focus on different mediums, ideas and cultural spaces
as well as his desire to play between them that pushes
the limits of contemporary digital art itself.
"There are a lot of people working with technology
and working with the Internet and working with digi-
tal media and it feels to me like sometimes it doesn't
feel particularly relevant or it's part of a very, very
small conversation," Proctor said. "I've always felt
that Cory is part of that conversation and also a part
of a larger conversation about art. Especially since
within the 20th century a lot of the most interesting
work has come out of moments where visual artists
and dancers and musicians and filmmakers and all
these people were talking to each other."
"(With) these moments of real innovation and
experimentation ... (they) were able to do new things,"
he said. "And I feel like that's something that's going
on here as well."
DESTROYING WALLS AND
CAGES AT THE'U'
Arcangel is on the stage of UMMA's Helmut
Stern Auditorium in collaboration with the Univer-
sity's Digital Music Ensemble. He is holding a large
Conan the Barbarian sword that's almost as tall as he
is. Holding the sword's handle in his two hands, he
runs a couple of feet to smash the blade of the sword
against a metal cage that has been strung with piano

wire and connected to a guitar amplifier.
The resultingsound is gigantic and distorted. Nois-
es fill the auditorium: The crash of metal againstmetal
and the distorted twang of piano wires emitted by the
amplifier. The sound is reminiscent of a plugged-in
guitar that has been thrown down a stairwell.
Arcangel steps back to wind up again. He hits the
cage once more with the sword, and a booming sound
rises from the speakers and the stage. The cage bends
ever so slightly and buckles under the force of the hit.
When Arcangel stops for a breath, the audience
begins to clap, assuming the finale has passed -
instead, the artist throws out a hand and explains,
quite placidly, "Oh we're not done yet. I have about 30
years of sitting in front of a computer, not letting out
any aggression."
The cage Arcangel had been destroying is an
instrument constructed by a student in the Univer-
sity's Digital Music Ensemble, a group composed of
students at the University who take a class on digital
and performance art. The Ensemble is led by Stephen
Rush, professor of dance and music technology in the
school of Music, Theatre & Dance.
Last week, Arcangel was invited to perform with
the Ensemble in an event titled "Cory Arcangel
and the Digital Musical Ensemble: Master Class in
Reverse," in which he played students' instruments
on stage with a catch: He wasn't supposed to know
how any of the instruments worked beforehand. The
result involved a great deal of improvisation, painful
noise feedback and a few broken instruments,but ulti-
mately ended in a thought-provoking performance.
"Students from a number of disciplines take the
course. ... Now there's a grad student in poetry and
a grad student from art, a bunch of people who are
doing video work and people studying sound record-
ing," Rush said.
Taking this array of students, the mediums they
work with and their perspectives on art, then bring-
ing these things together allows students to, accord-
ing to the Digital Music Ensemble website, "realize
their artistic goals by often utilizing unconventional
means." This is, in a way, what Arcangel does at the
forefront of his artistic interests.
In short, Arcangel's art is about doing the
unthinkable: mixing kittens and avant-garde music
into a palatable video, the consumerism of auto-tune
and the anti-establishment attitude of radical folk
into a song and the non-expertise of Guitar Heroes
with the virtuosic compositions of 20th-century
composers.
It is Arcangel's willingness to delve into spaces that
haven't been clearly defined that makes his artwork
not only cutting edge but also accessible, re-thinking
ideas that were once seen as contradictory or incom-
prehensible. Arcangel's work seeks to do just that
- de-art-ify art and strip down its conceptions, dis-
tilling them in ways that are far-reaching so that art
can be lived with - found in living rooms and viral
videos - rather than found untouched on the highest
shelf of a museum, just out of reach.

In Borders's opinion, it's a moot Borders went so far as to ques-

tion the significance of notation in
an age where music can be record-
ed and manipulated in so many dif-
ferent ways.
"(Written notation) can be
terrifically valuable," Borders
explained, "but we can record
music digitally."
"Composers can say 'OK I've got
these notes. Put them on the screen,
let's move this one around, make
this one louder, I think we need a
little more space there, let's cut and
paste that 50 times,"'he added.
Taking it a step further to
the world of reality TV, Borders
referred to "American Idol."
"Watch 'American Idol' -
you've got two genres that succeed
in that show," Borders said, speci-
fying the reoccurring gospel and
country idioms.
"None of the ornamentation that
they're using has ever been noted
down," he added. "The way these
people learn (the songs) has noth-
ing to do with recording in writing,
it has to do with recording on a tape
or digital space."
But ultimately it doesn't matter
if one method prevails. There is a
rich cultural history in the passing
down of musical knowledge, be it
through written notation or aural
experience. And both methods have
proven fruitful, so next time you
