Michigan's Proposal

WASHINGTON - Nearly eight
months after the U.S. Supreme
Court heard oral arguments
in Fisher v. the University of
Texas, the court ruled Tuesday
that affirmative action remains
permissible in cases where there
are "no workable race-neutral
alternatives" to build campus
diversity.
Initially considered a case
with potential for a landmark
ruling, the justices fell short of
issuing a sweeping affirmation or
elimination of race as a factor in
college admissions.
The justices have sent the case
back to the Fifth Circuit Court,
the lower federal appeals court,
for review. The majority opinion,
ruled 7 to 1, argued that the
lower court failed to prove the
University of Texas exhausted
all other race-neutral options in
creating a diverse class.

change in nature
and character of
neighborhood
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Managing News Editor
Over the past several years,
downtown Ann Arbor's cityscape
has been radically transformed
by the arrival of several luxury
high-rise apartments that cater to
University students.
However, the change is not
welcomed by all. Many local
residents have expressed their
dismay at these new buildings,
which have changed the appearance
of the downtown area.
Some of these residents had been
meeting on an advisory committee
since late 2009 until 2012 in an
attempt to maintain the character of
the city's residential neighborhoods,
specifically the areas close to the
University. They had focused their
attempts on reforming the high-
density residential code, 4RC, that
governs what buildings can be built
within the zone.
The existing code has been in
place since 1963 but has slowly
reformed based on a Central
Area Plan developed in the early
'90s that rezoned Ann Arbor
into five distinct zones. The plan
includes the 4RC zone around
the University, which is primarily
inhabited by students.
After extensive research, the
advisory committee recommended
to the planning commission that
the zoning regulations be rewritten
to limit lot combinations - the
practice of combining adjacent lots
to build a bigger unit - based on
square footage in order to reduce
changing neighborhood layouts.
There are no current restrictions on
this practice.
While the commission agreed
with almost all of the committee's
recommendations, they rejected the
call for lot limitations on the basis
that it should be left to the purview
of the planning commission case-
by-case. It also suggested the
creation of a new group-housing
zone in order to concentrate
rental housing in the 4RC zone by

allowing for more flexibility in the
zoning code that would encourage
landlords to build in those areas.
The recommendations of
the planning commission were
presented before the Ann Arbor
City Council at a meeting in early
April. These changes suggested
by the commission, if approved by
the council, would be written into
zoning code and applied in the next
year after additional commission
meetings as well as a consideration
of public opinion.
Ann Arbor resident Nancy
Leff, who served on the advisory
committee, is part of a group of
residents who disagree with the
commission's proposals and have
started to circulate a petition
opposing the revisions. Leff and
another residents met Sunday to
discuss their opposition and sign
petitions.
"One of the main goals of our
committee was to try to preserve
and protect and keep the existing
character and nature of the
neighborhoods," Leff said. "The
issue of lot combinations is key to
retaining the housing stock that
exists there."
She added that a lack of specific
zoning code on lot combinations
could have a serious impact on the
neighborhood.
"It opens the door (for houses)
that would potentially eliminate
the single family housing stock
and replace it with larger group
structures," Leff said. "That is
something our neighborhood
doesn't want to see happen."

She said if regulations were left
to the discretion of the commission
and City Council, residents would
lose input over what was built
within their neighborhoods.
"We want the zoning code to
clearly state what the regulations
are," Leff said. "Every time you
let one of these issues go to the
planning commission, there is no
control anymore. They can choose
to do whatever they want."
Jane Klingston, another
resident who opposes the
planning commission's
amendments, wrote in an e-mail
interview that the creation of a
student housing zone - despite
the fact that it is not intended to
"designate any type of specific
living arrangement within this
area" - could be harmful to
students.
"I find (it) discriminatory and
(it) could be problematic for the
quality of rental housing options
for students," Klingston wrote.
"(The code) could potentially lead
to unsafe substandard housing for
students in a city where public safety
response is already stretched."
James Kosteva, director of
community relations for the
University, wrote in an e-mail
interview that though the city and
the University often do talk about
land use and planning in order "to
understand each others interests,"
the University was hesitant to
weigh in on these potential changes
that could affect students who live
off campus.
"The University rarely gets

involved in local land development
and zoning decisions unless the
interests of the institution are
directly or dramatically impacted,"
Kostevawrote.
City planner Matt Kowalski,
whoserved as aprojectmanageron
the advisory committee, said the
disagreement between members
of the planning commission
and advisory committee could
be traced to a debate on how to
preserve the nature and character
of the 4RC neighborhoods.
"We are just looking at it from
two different ways," he said.
Kowalski said not limiting lot
combinations allowed for more
creative developments in the 4RC
zone and would still be subject
to approval from the commission
based on their effects.
"We didn't want to preclude
potentially advantageous projects
to the city and community by
banninglot combinations," he said.
In regards to the proposed group
housing zonings, Kowalski said the
new code would work to preserve
the nature of neighborhoods. The
changes would still require site
planning and adherence to zoning
code, similar to special exception
zoning rules such as those required
when building a fraternity residence.
"What we want to do is
incentivize these people (through
flexible zoning code) on the fringe
to revert some of these houses to
residential owner occupied," he
said, "and concentrate some rental
units in this core area (around the
University)."

DailySports Writer
With the NBA Draft fast
approaching on Thursday, The
Daily broke down the specula-
tion surrounding former Michi-
gan guards Trey Burke and Tim
Hardaway Jr.'s potential landing
spots leading up to the draft before
doingsome speculating of its own.
Trey Burke: While four teams
have presented themselves as the
likely landing spots for Burke, one
seems to present the best opportu-
nity in the long termfor Burke.
Phoenix Suns: The Suns are
coming off a dreadful season after
they traded franchise staple, Steve
Nash, to the Los Angeles Lakers.
Finishing 25-57 and in last place in
the Pacific division, the Suns need
any help they can get.
Given their circumstance, it
might make sense for the Suns to
take the best player available at
the fifth pick and start to fill needs
immediately. However, their best
current player is a guard in Goran
Dragic, who averaged 14.7 points
per game and 7.4 assists per game.
So, Burke going here might not
be the best for him or the Suns.
Sitting behind Dragic would slow
the growth of Burke and hurt his
chances of developing an imme-
diate role as a leader. At the same
time, the Suns need someone to
work with Dragic and and Burke
can't do much if he isn't on the
court.
New Orleans Pelicans: The
newly named Pelicans once had
a point guard that they thought
would lead them for a long dura-
tion of time: Chris Paul. The Los
Angeles Clipper and soon-to-be
free agent was a cornerstone of the
Pelicans - formerly the Hornets -
and led them to the playoffs three
times, while earning All-NBA
Team selections three times dur-
ing his career in New Orleans. The
6-foot guard is a player that Burke
has said he models his game after.
The former Wake Forest prod-
uct has made a career out of using
his strength and dribbling skills to
get the basket when he feels like it,
and being a lockdown defender of
the opposition's best player.
While Burke aspires to be that
player, does his game factor into
the Pelicans' future? It might.
While they have point guard
Greivis Vasquez and shooting
guard Eric Gordon, the possibility
to draft another guard to possibly

take the rein from Vasquez after
Austin Rivers blew his opportu-
nity last season is tempting
Overall, the Pelicans are more in
the need for a small forward who
could filla bigger need.
Sacramento Kings: After a
season-plus of suspense surround-
ing whether the Kings would be
moving to Seattle or staying put in
the capital of California, a deal was
finally reached for the Kings to
stay put and eventually get a new
arena in Sacramento.
While that issue i§ settled, the
issue regarding the Kings' roster
remains. Following a fourth-place
finish with a 28-54 record in the
Pacific division, Sacramento will
try to recover. Though the tal-
ent remains present with center
DeMarcus Cousins, his behavior
and maturity still remain an issue.
Even if he isn't traded, as rumors
have indicated, the Kings lack a
true leader and star.
In addition to the Cousins
debacle, former Rookie of the Year
and starting point guard Tyreke
Evans is a free agent and doubt
has formed if the Kings will resign
him.
With a seemingly blank page,
Burke seems like a perfect fit for
the rebuilding franchise. Though
the possibility of trading down
to acquire more picks and talent
exists, the idea of Burke landing
there seems very likely. His poten-
tial to start right away combined
with his craftiness and ability to
change speeds could be helpful in
the years to come.
Detroit Pistons: Burke has
called Ohio home for many years,
but could a move to the Pistons
finally cement him in Michigan?
It could very well be.
After acquiring Jose Calderon at
the trade deadline last season, the
Pistons were hoping to see what
remained of the former Toronto
Raptor point guard while he men-
tored the inexperienced Brandon
Knight. With his deal expiring
after the season, the question
remains whether resigning him is
logical with a clear rebuilding pro-
cess going on.
The Pistons have two building
blocks in Greg Monroe and Andre
Drummond controlling the paint
already. But current point guard
Brandon Knight struggled in his
assigned role, prompting a call for
him to move to shooting guard, so
the acquisition of a point guard
makes sense here too. Burke could

be the key in the Pistons lineup,
which has been lacking a true
point guard since it lost Chauncey
Billups in 2008.
The issue that remains with the
Pistons is if Burke will be available
at the eighth pick.
Tim Hardaway Jr.: As scout-
ing reports have said, Hardaway
is a wild card. He has the potential
to be a great shooting guard in the
league. What will be the biggest
thing for him is whether he's in the
right location.
Los Angeles Clippers: With
Chad Ford's most recent mock
draft predicting him to go 25th
to the Clippers, some thought has
to go into the thought they would
select him.
With Chauncey Billups more
likely than not retiring or signing
elsewhere, a hole has been created
at the shooting guard position.
While Los Angeles has former
Michigan player Jamal Crawford
- the last Wolverine to be a lottery
selection or first round pick - he is
seen more as a sixth man or instant
offense for the team.
The team also has Willie Green,
who only started games last sea-
son when Billups was hurt in the
beginning of the season.
All of other positions for the
Clippers are met at the starting
level, so shooting guard seems to
be a priority.
Indiana Pacers: With the 23rd
pick in the draft, the Pacers have
the ability to go in a couple dif-
ferent directions. Playing to their
advantage, they could look to add
another big man to complement
Roy Hibbert and Ian Mahinmi.
Though starting power forward
David West is a free agent, early
indications have pointed to him
re-signing. If he is locked up and it
appears he will be, the Pacers will
need to look into reintroducing
small forward Danny Granger into
the lineup. With Paul George hold-
ing his former starting job down,
Granger could see minutes at the
four as the Pacers could go small,
so long as one of their bigs in Hib-
bert or Mahinmi is on the floor.
Where the Pacers can improve
is shooting guard. The team will
have back the blossoming Lance
Stephenson, who brought his game
to a new level in the playoffs on
both ends of the court. It appears
likely that he will retain the start-
ing position, but insurance behind
him will be needed. With just Ger-
ald Green behind him, another

option at the two seems like a need.
Enter Hardaway Jr.
San Antonio Spurs: During
the NBA Finals, a once unknown
shooting guard Danny Green set
the world on fire, hitting an NBA
Finals record 27 3-pointers.
Originally drafted by the Cava-
liers, Green was released and then
signed by the Spurs before getting
cut again. Green would eventu-
ally be re-signed by the Spurs and
extended before the start of last
season.
Green found his role with the
Spurs and shined when it mattered
the most. While it may not be bad
for Hardaway Jr. to be drafted by
a team he can have a more promi-
nent role on, the best spot for him
is a team where he can be the third
to fourth scoring option.

Burke transitions to life is a pro, awaits suitor

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
NEW YORK - Sitting in the
ballroom on the fifth floor of a
Times Square hotel Wednesday
afternoon, Trey Burke handled
questions about his past and his
future.
When asked about Michigan's
run to the NCAA Championship,
his workouts with NBA teams
drafting in the lottery and about
advice he had received, the former
Michigan point guard answered
with clarity, thought and compo-
sure. He knew the answers.
When he was asked about where
he thought he'd get drafted, what
would be his first purchase or how
he envisioned life in the NBA, he
shrugged his shoulders, stumbled
through responses and answered
with uncertainty. These questions
couldn't be answered.
Burke offered no gut feeling or

indication for where he might end his professional life, which start-
up. He couldn't say which team ed when Burke left Michigan to

Transportation
will provide
additional routes
for students
By STEPHANIE DILWORTH
Daily StaffReporter
For the late-night library
goers wanting additional
options to travel to their off-
campus homes, there may be
hope.
Central Student Government
is currently exploring the
possibility of a late-night, off-
campus bus route designed
to supplement other forms
of transportation such as
SafeRide, the free late-night
service that provides students
transportation after the regular
buses have stopped running.
The plan is in its early stages
and CSG is formulating rough
drafts of potential bus routes.
Their efforts are now focused
on determining optimal bus ride
lengths and figuring out the best
bus stops. Current bus stops are
predicated to be incorporated
into the plan.
Some potential routes being
explored include one that
travels with stops on Packard
Street, South University Avenue,
Geddes Avenue and East Huron
Street.
CSG reported that a draft
route proposal is scheduled
for completion by September
2013. After the proposal is
released, students will have an
opportunity to give feedback on
the bus routes.
Business senior Michael
Proppe, president of CSG, said
CSG has begun exploring ways
to fund the project and will not
formally reach out to anyone
until a proposal has been
developed.
Proppe said because this
is a CSG-initiated project, it
would provide some funding
but would be speaking with
various departments within the
University to look for ways to

fund the project.
According to a cost estimate
provided to CSG by the
Department of Public Safety,
the cost of running a potential
off-campus bus system with two
buses for five hours running
on Thursdays, Fridays and
Saturdays would cost $62.50 per
hour for each bus. That totals
to roughly $25,000 for one
semester.
"We want to make sure
that the students utilize this
resource," Proppe said. "We
want student focus groups to
help us with finalizing routes."
He said part of the reason he
is urging for the implementation
of additional bus routes is what
he believes is an ineffective
SafeRide system.
"SafeRide is over capacity
right now," Proppe said.
"There are three SafeRide
vans and we have hundreds of
students trying to get home
late at night. Students end up
walking home alone because
they don't want to wait for an
hour for SafeRide at the library
or wherever they are and don't
want to pay for a cab."
Proppe said the idea of an
off campus bus route was the
most popular of the campaign
platforms that CSG presented
and he thinks it's crucial for the
welfare of University students.
"The off campus busing is
something we are hoping will
alleviate some of the current
problems," he said. "I think this
is really important for the safety
of students at this school who
live off campus."
However, University
Transportation Manager
Jason Bidwell said that the
current SafeRide program was
problematic. Bidwell said he
believes that the University's
available transportation
resources are more than
sufficient for University
students.
"We do have a number of late
night transportation options
and they have met the demands
of students thus far," Bidwell
said. "There have not been

excessive wait times. They serve
the campus in, general and a
small area close to campus."
Current methods of
transportation at the University
include the Ann Arbor
Transportation Authority,
which allows students to ride
for free when they use their
M-Card; Ride-Home which
allows students, faculty and
staff to share a cab with limited
locations; SafeRide, which is
available when University buses
are not operating and NightRide
which is another sharect cab
ride service which operates
when the AATA is not operating.
NightRide is five dollars per
person and goes anywhere in
Ann Arbor and small sections of
Ypsilanti.
"We have always carefully
examined the demand of the
frequency of the service in order
to meet not only the needs to
students but employees and
others using our services,"
Bidwell said.
He added that the
Transportation Department is
always open to ways to improve
the University's transportation.
"I think we are always willing
to look at possible improvements
for the safety of the University
populous in general and
improving the safety of the
community."

in this month's headlines of the
Huffington Post, The Wall Street
Journal and The New York Times
- portraying the University in a
less than positive light.
Traders pay an undisclosed fee
to receive early access to a closely
watched economic indicator
compiled by the University, CNBC
reported two weeks ago. Since
then, everyone from members
of the University community to
New York Times op ed writer and
economist Paul - Krugman have
raised questions concerning the
morality and necessity of high-
frequency trading.
The figure, called the Index of
Consumer Sentiment, measures
consumer confidence and is
part of the U.S. Department of
Commerce's Index of Leading
Indicators.
University spokesman Rick

Fitzgerald said Reuters has
funded the research and handled
its distribution since 2007.
Reuters provides "roughly" $1
million to the University for the
research, Fitzgerald said. The
agreement stipulates that Reuters
distributes the data the University
produces.
The monthly figure is
published on Reuters' website
at 10 a.m., and Reuters' paying
customers receive the data early.
For these traders, the data is
distributed on a conference call
at 9:55 a.m. or at 9:54:58.000 a.m.
for subscribers to the ultra-low
latency distribution platform,
according to Reuters.
Ultra-low latency is in a
format specialized for high-
-speed computerized trading,
or, high-frequency trading. The
CNBC report questioned the
University's early release of data
to payingtraders, who were called
members of a "select group ... on
Wall Street" by AnnArbor.com.
Fitzgerald said the
partnership with Reuters allows
University researchers to focus
on developing data. Previously,
over 100 entities funded the
research and the University
distributed the index.

'U' needs more state funding to make education affordable
Last Thursday, the University's Board of Regents voted for a tuition increase
of 1.1 percent for in-state students and 3.2 percent for out of state students.
This was the lowest tuition increase by the University in almost 30 years,
but is nonetheless an increase. The Board of Regents and University administra-
tion certainly deserve credit for crafting a budget that will only modestly increase
tuition, as they were also able to keep net tuition payments frozen for lowest income
students. However, the real problem with the ever-rising cost of tuition lies with
a lack of money from the state. Michigan's legislature and Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder must increase funding for higher education in order to keep tuition down.

Over the last 50 years, the
percentage of the University's general
fund that comes from state funding
has steadily shrunk, falling from
nearly8o percentin 1960tolessthan 17
percentin2013.Thisisdueinlargepart
to shifts in the state's fiscal priorities,
and under Snyder this trend has
continued. University funding from
the state fell by 15 percent just two
years ago, and the funding increases
for this and next year are a paltry
two percent.
Although the state may not 'see
higher education as a priority when
the unemployment level is still over
eight percent, government officials
must realize that making tuition
more affordable is a solid investment
in the future of the state's economy.
According to The New York Times,only
26 percent of high achieving students
in low-income families are able to

attend and graduate from college. High
tuition rates make many students who
want a college education unable to
attend, hurtingthe economy asawhole
in both the long and short run. A college
education is the key to allowing
people to move forward and to
defeat economic stagnation. Thus, if
economic development is a priority, so
too must be making college affordable.
There are certainly areas of the
University's budget that haven't
experienced many cuts - particularly
faculty and administrative pay - but
cuts to these areas are no remedy for
the current situation. If the University
were to cut pay for professors or
hold back on remodeling buildings
and providing services to students,
it would only hurt the University's
prestige and ability to attract top
faculty and students.
Demanding heavier spending on

higher education from Snyder and
state legislators may, for the time
being, seem like a lost cause, as both
haveshownatendencynottoprioritize
increased funding for education at
either the K-12 or college level. Until
the make-up of the legislature changes
or current officials have a change of
heart, the University must continue
to aggressively fundraise and craft
creative ways to improve financial aid
and freeze tuition prices. Ideas like
Regent Mark Bernstein's "Go Blue
Bonds" and reserving a percentage
of all donations for financial aid - an
idea the Daily has suggested before -
are excellent examples.
The University should be commend-
ed for its work to keep tuition as low as
possible. But the state under Snyder
cannot continue to mask decades of
higher education funding decreases
with periodic, minuscule increases.

festival shines in
sophomore outing

It doesn't really matter how
far you've driven, how many
hours you've spent packed in your
friend's car wondering if the ride
will ever end; it doesn't even mat-
ter if you've gone a day (or, more
likely, days) without a shower.
Once that brilliant green "Fire-
fly" sign passes overhead, and you
feel the grass on your soles and
smell the forest on the air, the rest
of that stuff falls away. For a few
fleeting days, you're home again.
Carved out of the woods next
to the Dover Downs Speedway
(which provides the strangest
contrast: this hulking concrete
behemoth in view as you walk to
your immersion into nature), Fire-
fly is slowly gaining legs as one of
the major festivals of the summer.
Even with a less pulse-quickening
set of headliners this year (Red
Hot Chili Peppers, Tom Petty and
Foster the People, vs. last year's
Jack White, the Killers and the
Black Keys), the festival's atten-
dance only blossomed. There's
finally the sense that Firefly won't
be playing catch-up to Bonnaroo
and Lollapalooza much longer.
Not bad for its second year.
Oh, and for the record, partying
in the middle of the forest is pretty
damn fuii.
I kicked off my Firefly experi-
ence on Friday by getting as close
as possible to California natives
The Neighbourhood, who satis-
fied my expectations (but didn't
exceed them - chalk it up to the
inexperience of being a new band).
Luckily, unlike the mega-festivals
that dominate the summer land-
scape, Firefly puts on a max of two
shows at any given time, and head-
liners (usually, though not always)
play alone. Which meant that, in
addition to seeing some of the big-
ger draws, I was able to catch acts
like The Neighbourhood and Rob-
ert DeLong.
Speaking of which - if you
haven't heard of that last name,
do yourself a favor and look him
up now. The young DJ, who played
midday on Sunday, completely

outdueled all of the dance acts
that came before him - includ-
ing Calvin Harris, who, while fun,
quickly felt like he was playing a
familiar recipe. Noticeable build-
up to drop. Drop. Smoke columns
shoot up, rinse, dry, repeat.
But DeLong was something
else. For one, there's no canned
beats - Robert uses a looping
playback to build his own beats,
and then employs no shortage of
tools to mix and sample (contrast-
ing the usual "twist this knob, flip
that switch" with hardcore com-
puter gaming joysticks, live drum-
set solos and, at one point, waving
a wii-mote frantically for different
effects). It was easily the most fun
show of the festival.
Which is no small accolade in a
weekend packed with fun shows.
On Friday, Django Django brought
a kind of Euro-geek rhythm met
with enthusiastic dancing, and
Ellie Goulding was surprisingly
enjoyable, with soaring vocals
and thumping dance tracks. And
then, after a performance by The
Avett Brothers (who were also
surprisingly skillful and enter-
taining given the crowd), the Red
Hot Chili Peppers played the first
headliner set of the weekend. I've
seen RHCP before, and while both
shows were awesome (especially
for someone who knows the rep-
ertoire well), I'm beginning to
see a professional, albeit repeti-
tive approach by the band. Open
with an energetic hit (in this case,
"Can't Stop"), and then play the
many hits and singles they've put
out over the years, punctuated
by a jam or a deep track here and
there.
Saturday's lineup was likely the
weakest of the three days, includ-
ing the headliner Tom Petty (no
offense to Petty fans, but I just
prefer the other two more). How-
ever, Jim James, the My Morning
Jacket frontman (originally fill-
ing in for an early cancellation by
Imagine Dragons) put on another
unexpectedly quality act, includ-
ing pulling out a saxophone early
on for some afternoon serenading.
And following that, Kendrick
Lamar put on perhaps the best
performance of the day. I saw
Kendrick a few months ago in
Michigan and - if anyone else Was
there, you probably agree - he
wasn't at his peak as a performer.
But the festival atmosphere com-

bined with a dense crowd likely
inspired what turned out to be a
thumping, edgy show, complete
with a true "freestyle verse" at the
end of a song (though -I'm always
dubious of the claim - how do
we know he doesn't use the same
freestyle verse for every show?).
Otherwise, Saturday was a day
for meeting expectations - except
for one point, where I, watched a
shirtless man booking it through
the crowd with a security guard
hot on his heels. After a moment,
the guard dove for a tackle, knock-
ing over bystanders in the process
- but at least it was more excit-
ing than the MGMT show, which,
while fun, was just the same old
stuff, and the (sorry to say) bor-
ing new stuff. Tom Petty was
Tom Petty - he played his hits,
grooved through his slower songs
and actually rocked at some of the
faster ones. He was classic Ton
Petty - if you're a fan, you prob-
ably already knew what to expect.
And then, before we all knew
it, Sunday had come, and we only
had the day's activities to look
forward to - no more, "I'll get it/
go there tomorrow, don't worry."
Which is a reasonable concern;
Firefly boasts an incredible
amount of other stuff to do out-
side music. Want to relax? Head
to the Hammock Hangouts, if you
think you're lucky enough to grab
one. Want to dance? Visit Firefly's
silent disco, a staple at other festi-
vals, which employs two DJs, and
headsets that can tune to either at
any time (making it all the more
awesome when half the crowd
shouts, "Ey, must be the money!"
and the other half shouts a second
later, "I don't care!I love it!").
But for me, I'm dialed into the
music, so I spent the day hopping
concerts like the previous two.
Matt & Kim was also surpris-
ingly fun, with crisp execution
and hilarious antics (seriously, go
see them - Kim talked about her
boobs repeatedly throughout the
set). Robert DeLong also abso-
lutely killed it, as I mentioned
above, which led into Dispatch
(classic jam band, but more palat-
able for non-fans) and Passion Pit.
I had been incredibly excited for
the latter, but unfortunately lead
singer Michael Angelakos had a
bad case of allergies. I gotta give
them credit - after cancelling on
Firefly last year, they were deter-

mined to get through a whole set early on if she could crowd-surf, to
this year. But Angelakos blew out which he emphatically denied -

itself, the trio rattled their neigh-
borhood with the vicious energy of
their songs in atime when Motown
was the popular genre and black
artists flourished. They were
rebellious, loud and with a band
name like Death, different.
It was David who believed in the
band's aesthetic. It was he who,
after all, formed the band and led
it. When it comes to telling the
story of Death, you inevitably tell a
story about brothers and the band's
VME visionary leader.
"You know, we were approached
by other people with those ideas
(of making a documentary)," Bobby
said. "But the one thing about Jeff,
as a filmmaker, is he really got into
the heart and soul and spiritual
mind of David. That was kinda the
doorway into our entire family and
to our entire music legacy."
Bobby is talking about Jeff
Howlett, a new filmmaker who
marks his directorial debut with "A

director Mark Covino ("Lucid").
Together, they crafted an intimate
portrait of a decades-spanning
family epic in the hope of bringing
us closer to a talent unrecognized
for half a lifetime.
"We just kinda led him into
being a member of our family,"
Bobby said. "And we trusted him
and he gained not only our trust
but the trust of members of our
family across the country."
The film itself has achieved
measurable success. At the 2013

nabbed the Audience Award for

uncertain.
"We're just on the journey and
we've been told that the journey's
only really just begun," Bobby said.
"We've gotten such a tremendous
response - from top actors in
Hollywood to just the man on the
street."
This kind of reception comes
at a surprise to the two brothers.
According to Dannis, the aver-
sive material the band recorded
required time for it to be appreci-
ated to any great extent.
"In my generation, people were
afraid to say the word 'death'
because of the stigma or whatever.
But when we come down to (the
younger) generation, they're not
afraid anymore. They're not afraid
to say 'death,' they're not afraid to
deal with the associations of it."
"In a lot of ways, they're a lot
smarter than we were," Bobby
added with a laugh. "Knowledge
is so accessible now. The average
15-year-old knows just as much
as a 25-year-old where back in
our day a 15-year-old was just a
15-year-old."
Those 40 years have gained
them an audience. They have liber-
ated Death of its repulsion, its stig-
ma, but yes, they stole things, too.
Those 40 years spent in obscurity
crushed David's artistic pursuits.
They separated a musician from
his deserved fame. They killed him
and they took away a brother who
will be missed greatly.
Death goes back on tour in
David's honor, to finish what he
started. In doing so, they recruit-

ed guitarist Bobbie Duncan who
brings a "refreshing New York
style," as Dannis said.
"David left a wealth of songs,"
Bobby said. "David and myself
wrote so many songs together that
we had intended to record because
we were convinced that we would
eventually end up getting a big
contract, so we better have a lot
of songs ready. I've got a wealth, a
wonderful well to pull from of all
these great ideas and great music.
There's gonna be a lot of great
Death music to come."

get to go back WOLFE
to the woods.
To a world
of dirty cabins, mass-produced
food and fun on the beach. I'll be
spending my summer at one of the
largest camps in the world where
the outdoors around me is my
office. And for the third straight
year, I'm going to be a counselor -
this time for 14-year-olds.
It's really a strange situation. At
home, I'm still very much a child.
Sure, I can live in Ann Arbor and
make it to CVS or Meijer if I need
groceries or other supplies, but for
the most part, when I'm at home,
my parents still take care of me at
this point in my life.
But at camp, my hierarchy is
turned upside down. I'm the most
important person in these kids'
lives. I'm truly the closest thing
these campers have to a parent for
the three or six weeks they spend
at camp. In the previous years I
have worked, I have experienced
the most challenging moments of
the life, but also the most reward-
ing. A high score on an exam is an
incredible feeling, but few things
compare to helping a camper suc-
cessfully water ski for the firsttime.
Much has been said about the
benefits of young children going
to camp. However, the benefits
of being a counselor shouldn't
go unnoticed either - especially
since each year, many college-
age students face the choice of
embarking on a hopefully paid
internship or becoming a coun-
selor at both sleepaway and day
camps. And while it's true that
counselors have been stereotyped
as lazy and simply trying to avoid
a real-world job, the return - if we
want to talk about investments -
has the potential to be immense if
a full effort is put forth.
The opportunity for leadership
is tremendous. In my experience,
I have had the chance to plan and
execute unique, inspiring pro-
grams for kids with many differ-
ent staff members. It has helped

is real
my ability to work with others,
develop interpersonal skills and
learn to know when to take charge
and when to take a step back - a
skill that is a challenge for any-
one to develop. This also hap-
pens when doing day-to-day tasks
with the 10 or so kids I'm respon-
sible for. I'm their leader and am
expected to take care of them.
Few things
compare to
helping a camper.
Like any job, there are ups and
downs. But in no other activ-
ity have I found my confidence
rise like it does as a counselor.
Parents across the country are
counting on counselors - remind
you, complete strangers -toensure
their children conquer their fears,
make friends and attain positive
memories. It's a responsibility not
to be taken lightly, because the
interaction between camper and
counselor changes lives for good
or for bad. So at the end of the
summer, when a parent thanks me
for my work, near-euphoria ensues.
Perhaps, most importantly,
being a counselor thrives on the
service-above-self philosophy.
There are many professions - all
of them, actually - that demand
their members to put the com-
munity's needs above those of the
individual. It's a concept hard to
grasp and something I still strug-
gle with. But if service-above-self
can be mastered in the camp set-
ting, then where can't it be?
The desire to pursue that
resume-building internship
is tempting, no doubt. On the
surface, spending a summer in the
woods with a bunch of little kids
appears like a colossal waste of
time. Taken seriously, though, it
doesn't have to be. To have one of
the best jobs in the world before
turning 20 is surreal.
I know I'm not ready to enter
the "real world" where suits and
ties replace Nike shorts and flip-
flops. But the opportunity to
essentially be a child's parent and
a role model sure seems like one of
the most "real" jobs out there.

yourself into
some prime
standing real
estate, behind
a girl who is-
shorter than PAIGE
you, and only PFLEGER
four rows of
people away
from the stage. Not too shabby.
You wait and wait, and conve-
niently, once your feet start to
hurt, the lights dim, the proverbial
curtain rises and the stars of the
show take their place, audience
cheering. You're euphoric - when
it comes to the concert experience,
you have nailed it.
But don't be so quick to rejoice.
The band strikes the first chord,
and suddenly the stage is obstruct-
ed. Why? What has happened?
Well, a sea of arms has risen up
above heads, propping up hands
holding iPhones set to record. For
you, it's nearly impossible to see.
For the others, well, why does it
matter if they watch the concert
now when they can just experi-
ence it all later, over and over
again on high-definition screens
wherever they go? You're left
with a choice - join the electronic
revolution and experience things
solely through pixels like a Cubist
nightmare, or settle on not see-
ing a show you paid good money
for. With an air of defeatism you
allow yourself to become another
human tripod, just a stabilizing

ground for your smartphone to
take a video that automatically
gets spammed to Facebook, a pic-
ture that your followers see on
Instagram and Twitter and an
actual experience missed.
It seems to be a common prac-
tice that's now just pure human
habit. Is something crazy hap-
pening? Well, what are you wait-
ing for? Pull out your phone and
take a picture. We're really nat-
urals at gawking, which is the
reason we have traffic jams after
small accidents - you can't help
but join the masses, slow down
and take a look. Social media sites
have done nothing but justify
this kind of behavior, by giving
us a million different places to
chronicle anything and every-
thing that's going on. Your life,
no matter how well-lived, isn't
considered worthy unless you
have so many followers on Twit-
ter, so many friends on Facebook,
so many reblogs on Tumblr and
so on. So it has almost become a
challenge of who can document
it best, turning the focus away
from actually enjoying the things
that are happening in front of our
faces, to capturing them instead.
I take you next to the dystopian
worlds created in literary works
such as "1984", "Fahrenheit 451"
and "Brave New World," to name
a few. A mixture of pessimism
and lack of faith in the human
race has led me to a love affair
with novels telling of a future
that we have ruined ourselves,
and I believe that these social
media sites that have convinced
us that we are all worthy of being
encapsulated autobiographically
are just a small step down a road

leading us to a world much like
those great authors have warned
us about, and here is why - if
our only enjoyment comes from
likes on Facebook and retweets
on Twitter, we're going to forget
how to live our lives like humans
instead of robots dependent on
electronics for survival.
So put the phone
down, and live a
little.
"Most human beings have an
almost infinite capacity for taking
things for granted."
-Aldous Huxley, author of
"Brave New World"
Huxley isn't mistaken, either.
We're taking so many things for
granted, and being enabled to
do so with our smartphones and
computers. Watching a sunset
over the ocean counts just as
much, if not more, if you watch
as that last lip of light disappears
over the edge of the water, even if
you don't quite catch it on camera.
While you were busy chronicling
your existence, the world
continued to spin around you and
no matter how much your social
media accounts make it look like
you have lived, you're completely
missing the fact that life is more
than a sepia-toned photo - it's
about truly experiencing the
world we live in. So put the phone
down, and live a little.

Michael Wellman, professor
of electrical engineering and
computer science who researches
computational finance, said the
University must always reconcile
its responsibilities in the public

which Fitzgerald said was needed
to fund the Survey of Consumers.
"The University is engaging in
this research that is ultimately
provided to the public," Wellman
said. "It costs the University
something to conduct the survey
and create this indicator."
He added that the early release
of data is fair if parties are aware
of the imbalance.
"The important thing is

disclosure," Wellman said. "If
someone is getting a two second
advantage, everyone should
understand that."
Fitzgerald said the options are
fully disclosed in the two parties'
contract and are advertised to all
customers. However, the CNBC
report reflected that some users
of the 9:55 a.m. conference call
were unaware of the "ultra-low

two-second advantage
"disingenuous."
Uday Rajan, associate professor

in the "intense competition" of
computerized trading.
"In each transaction, they
make an extremely small amount
of money," Rajan said. "But

become so huge in the last decade
or so, it can add up to a large
amount."
Computerized trading has
existed since the 1980s, Rajan
said. High-frequency trading, a
21st century invention, depends
on sophisticated computers
and algorithms that process
information in milliseconds.
Firms who use such technology
can process large quantities of
orders instantly.
A burst of trading activity was
noted at 9:54:57.975 on May 17 by
analysis firm Nanex. Within 10
milliseconds, more than 100,000
shares were exchanged and, 10
seconds in, $100 million were
traded.
The two-second advantage -
and certainly the five-minute
one - may provide an advantage
for traders whose stocks depend
on consumer expectations for the
market. If computers process that
American consumers have low
expectations for a salary raise, it
may result in the selling of stocks.
It is valuable for the trader that
other market participants are
unaware of consumer's low
expectations. In such a scenario,
traders who purchased the
9:54:58.000 a.m. option view
themselves as being in a better
position than those who views
consumer index information at
10 a.m.
Rajan said research has
not concluded whether high-
frequency trading is beneficial
or efficient, though he said the
media stigmatizes it for the large
quantity of money such traders
may generate. He added that it
provides a middleman for traders,
thus lowering the fees needed for
parties to trade shares.
However, Wellman said high-
-frequency trading introduces
unneeded costs, like specialized
hardware that is necessary for
traders to receive financial data
at the exact millisecond.
Wellman authored a 2013
paper with Engineering doctoral
candidate Elaine Wah that
revealed the flaws of a certain
type of high-frequency trading
called latency arbitrage.
Rajan said high-frequency
traders' existence could lower
participation with less market
participants, meaning less
competition.
"The other parties are aware
that these guys can move very
quickly and maybe more reluctant
to take part in trading," he said.
"That can be potentially harmful
to other traders in the market."

DECISIONS
From Page 1
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a
lengthy dissent,upbraidingthe court
for acting outside their jurisdiction.
Summarizing his dissent in the
courtroom, the conservative justice
said the majority opinion pawned
the Framers' vision for "the court's
moment in the spotlight."
Scalia wrote that the majority
opinion paints those opposed to
the universal marriage equality
as "the enemy of human decency,"
whereas, in reality the truth is
much more complicated as judges
and policymakers grapple with the
implications of having no federal
definition of marriage.
"The court has cheated both
sides, robbing the winners of an
honest victory, and the losers of the
peace thatecomes from a fair defeat,"
he wrote. "We owed both of them
better."
In a second case, the court
ruled 5 to 4 that the defendants
in Hollingsworth v. Perry had no
standing to bring their case before
the Supreme Court after a decision
in a lower court struck down
California's same-sex marriage
ban, a voter initiative known as
Proposition 8. While the court did
not rule on the constitutionality
of the ban, it allowed the lower
COURT
From Page 1
When the case returns to the
lower court, it must further assess
whether the University of Texas has
provided enough evidence to prove
it has upheld the admissibility of
affirmative action under previous
court precedent.
In the majority opinion, Justice
Anthony Kennedy said the
determining factor on race-based
admissions was whether or not the
program fitcertain strictcriteria.
"The Fifth Circuit must assess
whether the University (of Texas)
has offered sufficient evidence to
prove that its admissions program
is narrowly tailored to obtain the
educational benefits of diversity,"
Kennedy said.
The case had provided the court a
chance to review Gratz v. Bollinger
and Grutter v. Bollinger, two cases
involvingthe Universityandbearing
the name of former University
President Lee Bollinger.
In 2003, the court struck down
the University's practice of awarding

court's ruling to stand, thus allowing
same-sex marriages to resume in
California.
As a result, the decision leaves
state marriage bans, including the
one in Michigan, unaffected.
Though the court failed to expand
full marriage rights to same-sex
couples across the nation,supporters
outside the court heralded
Wednesday's rulings as victories,
despite their limitations.
Spilling onto the sidewalk
and pushing up the court's white
marbled steps,supporters held neon-
colored signs trumpeting slogans
such as "We are you," and "Marry
who you love." Holding small blue
flags marked with the movement's
symbolic equal sign, attendees
called for equality now, punctuated
by bursts of patriotic songs.
LSA sophomore Ashley Burnside
was outside the court when news
of the decisions spread through the
gathered crowd, numbering in the
hundreds.
"When people look back on this
moment, the end of DOMA is going
to be one of the biggest milestones,"
Burnside said, noting cameras and
iPhones that danced around her as
people attempted to capture and
share the moment on film.
She said the decisions are not
only significant in the fight for
marriage equality, but also have
the opportunity to spark new
conversations about LGBT rights.
pointstoadmissionscandidatesbased
on race, but upheld the use of race as
one of many factors in holistically
evaluating potential students.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said in a press release that
she was content with the Court's
decision.
"Although Fisher does not
directly apply to us, we are pleased
that the Supreme Court has upheld
Grutter and continues to recognize
the educational benefits that come
with a diverse student body,"
Coleman said. "At the University of
Michigan, we remain committed to
building and maintaining diversity
on our campus, and we will continue
toworktowardthatgoalinwaysthat
comply with state and federal law."
While the court shied from
making a widespread determination
in the Fisher ruling, the court
has agreed to hear another case
involving affirmative action in
the fall. The case will concern
Michigan's Proposal 2 - a voter
initiative which citizens voted to
outlaw the use of race in college
admissions in the state.
Law School Prof. Richard Primus,
who specializes in constitutional

LSA senior Russ Hayes, chair of
the University's chapter of College
Republicans,wroteinastatementthat
many members of the organization
were pleased with the outcome ofthe
case - in contrast to many members
of the national party. A Pew research
study from March showed that only
25 percent of Republicans support
gay marriage; however, among
Republicans aged 18-29, that number
was up to 39 percent.
"Personally, I'm happy with the
results, asarealotoffolksI'vespoken
to inthe College Republicans,"Hayes
wrote. "The DOMA ruling reaffirms
the importance of federalism, a core
tenet of the Republican party."
The University's chapter of the
College Democrats was unavailable
for comment.
Dozens of college students
- many of whom skipped an
internship, class or college
orientation to witness the moment in
person - cited the decisions as both
a marker of progress and a rallying
call for further efforts in securing
marriage equality.
Similar sentiments were echoed
by politicians such as U.S. Senator
Carl Levin (D-Mich), who said
the decisions will ensure that the
constitutional rights of millions of
Americans are protected.
"Today's Supreme Court rulings
are victories for equality and for
simple human dignity," Levin wrote
in a statement. "I'm hopeful that
law, said while the ruling was a
surprise to many observers across
the political spectrum, some within
the legal community had expected
this outcome.
"One big takeaway from this
opinion is that 10 years later, the
Michigan model for affirmative
action remains the constitutional
standard," Primus said. "The court
today is more conservative than
it was 10 years ago. Most people
though Grutter wouldn't last. So far,
the Michigan model holds up."
Kennedy's decision to side with
the majority in this decision was
not unprecedented, Primus said.
Although he dissented in Grutter,
Primus said Kennedy recognizes
the need for diversity in higher
education and this ruling was
consistent with his principles.
"Justice Kennedy doesn't think
that affirmative action is always
unconstitutional, and you can't
get the sweeping ruling against
affirmative action without Justice
Kennedy," Primus said.
He said though Kennedy supports
diversity, he does not believe
affirmative action is an overall
solution.

our nation's centuries-long march
toward equality will continue to
move forward."
Beyond the Beltway, speakers and
supporters gathered in Kerrytown's
Braun Court to laud the merits of the
court's decisions.
Sandi Smith, president of the
Jim Toy Community Center, an
organization supporting LGBT
citizens in Washtenaw County,
helped facilitate the rally. She
has been with her partner for 18
years and said she will continue to
work towards improving rights for
Michigan's LGBT community.
Smith said the rulings provided
a basis to continue the fight for
equality in Michigan, citing the
number of advantages, such as
domestic partnerhbenefits, that were
not provided to members of the
LGBTQ community.
"We have (a) good foundation to
work from," She said. "There are
all kinds of things we need to do.
Marriage is just one of the pillars ...
today we celebrate. Tomorrow we
get back to work."
Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor),
who appeared at Wednesday
evening's rally to applaud the
promise and historical nature of the
decisions, told The Michigan Daily
he plans to pursue every avenue
to realize marriage equality in
Michigan.
While the decision in
Hollingsworth v. Perry has opened
"Kennedy has said for years now
that universities have a compelling
interest in assembling diverse
student bodies, and that interest can
besufficienttojustifyrace-conscious
admissions - he's said that for years.
He's skeptical of (affirmative action).
He doesn't want it tobe used when it
isn't necessary."
Primus added that in Grutter,
Kennedy believed the court didn't
look carefully enough at whether
or not the University needed to use
race-based criteria for admission.
However, in Fisher v. the University
of Texas, the issue was what kind
of criteria the University of Texas
could use - assuming that it did
need to use affirmative action.
That assumption of whether or
not affirmative action is necessarycto
achieve a diverse studentbody at the
University of Texas is largelyswhat is
at stake in the circuit court. Because
the University of Texas may seek
to prove using statistics and other
evidence that affirmative action
policies were justified, the case may
devolve to a district court first since
these items cannot be heard in a
circuit court.
Later this year, the University

the door to another similar case
next session, Irwin has already
introduced a package of bills, along
with other state representatives,
that could negate Michigan's same-
sex marriagehban.
Though Irwin hesitated to predict
ifa completed lawwill arrive quickly,
he said he will continue to join gay
rights advocates and like-minded
elected officials in trumpeting the
cause. Irwin also noted a majority of
Michigan's population nowsupports
gay marriage, compared to the 59
percent of voters who passed the
same sex marriage ban, Proposition
4, in 2004.
While swiftly ushering this
legislation though Lansing will
remain a challenge, Irwin said
he encourages citizens continue
to communicate with their
representatives as he and his
colleagues work to bring more
conservative officials to the table. A
voter referendum is another option
Irwin said has notbeen ruled out.
Moreover, a U.S. district court
will hear a case this fall concerning
a Hazel Park couple who are
challenging the constitutionality
of the state's ban. Irwin said what
happens in that case could overturn
Michigan's Proposition 4.
While public opinion has swung
in favor of gay marriage in recent
years, the justices may again use
a waiting period before ruling
decisively on the issue.
will be more closely involved with
another case pending before the
SupremeCourt, Schuettev.Coalition
to Defend Affirmative Action. At the
heart of the case is the legality of
Michigan's 2006 ban on affirmative
action, Proposal 2. In November, the
Sixth Circuit Court sitting en banc
narrowly struck down the ban - but
delayed it going into effect pending
the Supreme Court's review of the
case.
Primus said the Fisher case
will have little to no bearing on
Schuette because the cases deal
with fundamentally different
issues. While Fisher dealt with the
necessity of affirmative action and
whether it was applied correctly,
Schuette focuses more on whether
states banning affirmative action
violate the equal protection clause
of the Constitution by not allowing
students to discuss the implications
of race on their applications even
while considering other non-
academic factors.
"(Fisher) is a case about what
a university can do," Primus
said. "Schuette is about what a
referendum can do. Those are the
constitutional questions."
