CAMPUS COMMUNITY
T Irotter oniy building at
tU named after minorit

first semester
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily News Editor.
One semester after imple-
mentation, the transition to the
University's new policy of con-
tinuous enrollment for graduate
students has gone as anticipat-
ed, according to University offi-
cials.
The policy, which was ini-
tially proposed about three
years ago, requires all doctor-
ate students to enroll and pay
tuition every semester. Students
are allowed to take approved
leaves of absence as well as one
semester off during their time at
the University for non-approved
reasons. Previously, doctorate
students were only required to
pay tuition for semesters when
they were enrolled in classes.
Though the policy was sharp-
ly criticized by some on campus
before it was officially imple-
mented last semester, Rack-
ham Dean Janet Weiss said in

to plan.
"We've worked really hard
to make the implementation go
smoothly," Weiss said."... We've
had to make a variety of adapta-
tions in situations where per-
sonal circumstances required,
but we've gotten huge coop-
eration from lots of people, and
that's allowed us to be flexible
when we've needed to be flexi-
ble and accommodate individual
circumstances."
Weiss said 500 more doctor-
ate students enrolled in Rack-
ham Graduate School for the
fall 2010 semester than the
previous year. Still, Weiss said,
the increase in students doesn't
mean there are actually more
doctorate students at the Uni-
versity.
"Those of course are not new
students, those were students
who were here and working,
but previously not enrolled," she
said. "So it looks like there is a
big growth in the doctorate pro-
gram. There is not. There's just a
growth in enrollment."

Officials, students
express mixed
views about lack of
representation
By SABIRA KHAN
Daily StaffReporter
The University often pro-
motes its commitment to diver-
sity and boasts about its diverse

student body. This dedication
to maintaining a heterogeneous
University community, how-
ever, isn't reflected in campus
building namesakes.
Only one University build-
ing, the Trotter Multicultural
Center, is named after a person
who is a minority. University
officials said the lack of rep-
resentation through campus
building names isn't deliberate,
and there are other areas on
campus named after minorities.

Other members of the Universi-
ty community expressed mixed
feelings, including pride and
disappointment, of what this
represents.
The Trotter Multicultural
Center, located at 1443 Washt-
enaw Ave., is named after Wil-
liam Monroe Trotter, who was
a prominent African American
civil rights activist in the early
20th century. With civil rights
activist W.E.B. DuBois, Trot-
ter founded the National Asso-

ciation for the Advancement of
Colored People.
John Matlock, the Univer-
sity's associate vice provost
and director of the University's
Office of Academic Multicultur-
al Initiatives, wrote in an e-mail
interview that there are several
spaces on campus named after
African American individuals,
but the Trotter Multicultural
Center is the only building that
honors an African American

A fire at an Ann Arbor house
remains under investigation by
the Ann Arbor Fire Department
* after it killed one victim and

critically injured another early
Saturday morning.
The fire took place off campus
at 2275 Westaire Ct., where five
people had been living, AAFD
Fire Inspector Reka Farrackand
said yesterday morning.
Firefighters found Jacob
Rachford, 20, of Ann Arbor,
unconscious in the basement of
the home, as well as a woman
named Tyne Mosbey, who was
also unconscious. Mosbey was
transported to Butterworth
Hospital in Grand Rapids, where

she remains incritical condition,
a Butterworth Hospital official
confirmed last night.
Rachford was pronounced
dead at the University Hospital
Saturday, according to AAFD
Chief Dominick Lanza.
Rachford is a 2009 graduate
of Community High School in
Ann Arbor. Neither Rachford
nor Mosbey are affiliated with
the University.

Better than mom

Catering to hundreds of stu-
dents at a time, the washers and
dryers in University residence
halls and off-campus apartment
buildings are prone to mainte-
nance issues. Along with long
waits for machines and the risk
of a stranger handling your deli-
cates, many students just opt to
go home to mom and dad with a
full basket of dirty laundry.
But if trekking all the way
home for a few loads of laundry
is too much effort, students can
take advantage of several off-
campus laundry services.
Two local cleaners, Busy-
body's Student Laundry and
The ClothesLine, offer pick-
up and drop-off services at
residence halls and off-campus

housing for students in a laun-
dry jam. Though The Clothes-
Line focuses on the Central
Campus area, Busybody's picks
up laundry on North Campus as
well, according to the services'
websites.
Both services offer semester-
long or one-time deals and vary
in price based on the weight of
the laundry. Pick-up and drop-
off times differ based on a cus-
tomer's location in Ann Arbor,
accordingto the websites.
Students looking for a self-
serve option outside of resi-
dence halls or their off-campus
housing have several choices,
including Mr. Stadium Coin
Laundry & Dry Cleaning on
South Industrial Highway

or Champions Party Store,
Laundromat & Dry Cleaners
on South Forest Avenue. Mr.
Stadium also has free Wi-Fi,
and students 21 years or older
can purchase beer and wine at
Champions while waiting for
their clothes to dry.
For clothes that need profes-
sional attention, there are vari-
ous dry cleaners located near
all areas of campus, including
Gold Bond Cleaners on May-
nard Street, College Cleaners on
South University Avenue, Iris
Cleaners on South Main Street
and One Hour Martinizing
at three locations on Packard
Street, West StadiumBoulevard
and Plymouth Road.

Egyptian military promises no
force against ongoing protests

President Mubarak
makes further
concessions to
protest demands
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's mili-
tary promised yesterday not to
fire on any peaceful protests
and recognized "the legitima-
cy of the people's demands,"
a sign army support for Presi-
dent Hosni Mubarak may be
unraveling. Protesters planned
a major escalation, calling for
a million people to take to the
streets to push Mubarak out of
power.
More than 10,000 people beat
drums, played music and chant-
ed slogans in Tahrir Square,
which has become ground zero of
seven days of protests demand-
ing the ouster of the 82-year-old
president who has ruled with an
authoritarian hand for nearly
three decades.
With the organizers' calling
for a march by one million people

today, the vibe in the sprawling
plaza - whose name in Arabic
means "Liberation" - was inten-
sifying with the feeling that the
upheaval was nearing a decisive
point. "He only needs a push,"
was one of the most frequent
chants, and one leaflet circulated
by some protesters said it was
time for the military to choose
between Mubarak and the peo-
ple.
The latest gesture by Mubarak
aimed at defusing the crisis
fell flat. His top ally, the Unit-
ed States, roundly rejected his
announcement of a new govern-
ment yesterday that dropped
his interior minister, who heads
police forces and was widely
denounced by the protesters.
The crowds in the streets were
equally unimpressed.
"It's almost the same govern-
ment, as if we are not here, as
if we are sheep," sneered one
protester, Khaled Bassyouny,
a 30-year-old Internet entre-
preneur. He said it was time to
escalate the marches. "It has to
burn. It has to become ugly. We

have to take it to the presidential
palace."
Another concession came
later last night, when Vice Presi-
dent Omar Suleiman - who was
appointed by Mubarak only two
days earlier - went on state TV
to announce that the president
had tasked him to immediately
begin dialogue with "political
forces" for constitutional and
legislative reforms.
Suleiman, alongtime Mubarak
confidant, did not say what the
changes would entail or which
groups the government would
speak with. Opposition forces
have long demanded a lifting
of strict restrictions on who is
eligible to run for president to
allow a real challenge to the rul-
ing party, as well as measures to
ensure elections are fair. A presi-
dential election is scheduled for
September.
In Washington, White House
spokesman Robert Gibbs dis-
missed the naming of the new
government, saying the situa-
tion in Egypt calls for action, not
appointments.

WINTER RUSH
From Page 1
ated with fraternities, like senior
houses, are prohibited from giv-
ing alcohol to students who are
completing the rush process,
according to Stepanovic.
"No chapter shall serve or pro-
vide alcohol to recruits nor allow
anyone on behalf of the chapter
to provide alcohol to recruits
during the recruitment period,"
the amended bylaw states.
LSA sophomore Dylan
Handelsman, IFC vice president
of internal recruitment, and Ste-
panovic said there have been no
reported infringements on the
ban.
Winter recruitment has been
particularly important for the
University's newer fraterni-
ties like Beta Theta Pi, which
returned to campus this fall after
a four-year hiatus.
Phil Fernandez, director of re-
establishment for Beta Theta Pi,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
the fraternity has been recruit-
ing steadily all year and has
extended its efforts beyond the
"sometimes awkward process of
formal rush," which Fernandez
compared to herding cattle.
"In our case, since many of our
new members never saw them-

selves 'going Greek' before this
opportunity, it was important for
us to recruit outside of the stan-
dard rush parameters," Fernan-
dez wrote.
But Handelsman said most of
the students rushing this semes-
ter are friends and acquaintances
of current fraternity members as
opposed to students with little
or no connection to the Greek
community - as is often the case
with fall recruits.
"It's mostly people who
already have the connections,"
Stepanovic said. "Generally the
guys know where they're head-
ed or have a good idea of where
they're headed."
School of Music, Theatre &
Dance freshman Jordan Golden
rushed four or five fraternities
this semester before accepting
a bid for Sigma Phi Epsilon. He
said several of his friends who
were in Sig Ep encouraged him to
rush but also suggested he tryout
other chapters in order to find
the right fit.
"I saw how much fun all my
friends were having, and I want-
ed to get involved," Golden said.
Two sororities at the Univer-
sity also participated in activities
outside the University's Panhel-
lenic Association formal recruit-
ment this semester to gain new
members. While Panhel doesn't

hold an official winter rush, both
Alpha Epsilon Phi and Phi Sigma
Rho sororities undertook winter
recruitment.
The University's chapter
of AEPhi opened its doors in
fall 2008, and currently has
43 members, according to LSA
sophomore Dana Schneider, the
University chapter's president.
LSA sophomore Jillian Wey-
man, AEPhi vice president of
recruitment, said the sorority is
looking to increase its numbers.
"Because we are a growing
chapter, and we're working our
way back up toward the soror-
ity total number, the Panhellenic
Association gives us the oppor-
tunity to do winter recruitment
and the ability to grow during
winter," Weyman said.
Since the sorority's recruit-
ment events are still ongoing,
Weyman said she doesn't have
a concrete idea of how many
women AEPhi will extend bids to
this semester.
"We're just looking for quality
girls, and whether we find five
or 100, we're just keeping it open
and having a good time with it,"
she said.
Unlike AEPhi, Phi Sigma Rho
doesn't participate in the Pan-
hellenic Association's formal
recruitment process because it's
only open to College of Engineer-
ing students, according to Engi-
neering junior Kelsey Kaplan,
president of the University's
chapter of Phi SigmaRho.
Every year, the sorority holds
its own informal rush events in
both fall and winter semesters,
Kaplan said. She said the soror-
ity also depends on its current
members to reach out to people
they know in order to recruit
new women. This semester, the
chapter added seven members
to its current membership of 38
women.
"Since we're so small, we have
to do it both semesters to keep
our numbers up," Kaplan said.

Hours before his arrest outside
a popular Detroit-area mosque, a
63-year-old California man held
court at anearbysports bar,telling
an employee that he was a Viet-
nam veteran-turned Muslim holy
warrior, that he planned to set off
a "big explosion," and that he was
"going to be part of making histo-
ry," the employees said yesterday.
Joe Nahhas, an operations
* manager at the J.S. Fields bar in
Detroit, told The Associated Press
that a man identified after his
arrest as Roger Stockham ordered
a double-Scotch on the rocks on
Jan.24 and told himhe planned to
cause an explosion that would be
"here, there, the mosque." Stock-
ham - who is bipolar and suffers
from other psychiatric disorders,
according to an attorney who rep-
resented him in a previous case
- was wearing a Vietnam War
veteran hat and said he is a Muslim
and a member of an Indonesian
mujahedeen group, Nahhas said.

Despite pleas, TSA
refuses to alter
screening process
The. Transportation Security
' Administration said it will not
hire private contractors to screen
airline passengers, despite calls
from a powerful Florida congress-
man to do so and passenger com-
plaints about federal screeners.
TSA Administrator John Pisto-
* le said in a memo to his employees
late Friday that the federal agency
will keep private contractors at
16 U.S. airports, but will not use
them anywhere else unless a clear
advantage emerges.
Pistole's memo comes two
months after Florida Republi-
can Rep. John Mica wrote to the
couatry'sa-busiest airports and
asked them to use private security
guards.

The 31-year-old pleaded guilty
yesterday to being involved in the
prodtdetion and distribution of a

He also pleaded guilty to fund-

ing associates in Yemen, offer-
ing himnself for terrorist training
abroad and encouraging others to
dothe same.
CHICAGO
Chicago governor
signs gay rights bill
Gov. Pat Quinn, saying it was a
"day of history," signed legislation
yesterday legalizing civil unions
for gayand lesbian couples, mak-
ing Illinois one of about a dozen
states that extend significant legal
protections to same-sex couples.
About 1,000 people crowded
into the Chicago Cultural Center
to watch Quinn, a Democrat, sign
the measure that supporters call a
matter of basic fairness and oppo-
nentsdecry as a threat to the sanc-
tity of traditional marriage.
"We believe in civil rights and
we'believe in civil unions," Quinn
said before signing the bill to a
roar:of cheers and applause.
The law, which takes effect
June 1, gives gay and lesbian cou-
ples official recognition from the
state and many of the rights that
accompany traditional marriage,
including the power to decide
medical treatment for an ailing
partner and the right to inherit a
partner's property.

Chrysler plans to
increase quarterly
profit under Fiat

Gov. Snyder unveils guide
to fix state's budge t woes

Net income
predicted to be
$500M for 2011
DETROIT (AP) - Chrysler
was collapsing when Fiat took
control of the company just 19
months ago.
Now, under the Italian auto-
maker's detail-driven CEO,
Chrysler is on the verge of turn-
ing its first quarterly profit since
its bankruptcy in 2009.
Chrysler Group LLC yesterday
said it dramatically narrowed its
losses in the fourth quarter and
2010. And it predicted net income
of $200 million to $500 million
for 201.
Chief Executive Sergio Mar-
chionne has transformed Chrys-
ler by managing its smallest
details, even picking the music for
company presentations.
As a result, Chrysler's vehicles
are startingto look and drive bet-
ter and its costs are under control.
Marchionne, 58, a Canada-
educated Italian who quickly
replaces executives who don't
deliver, has brought back the
speed and drive that Chrysler

once had. He pushed engineers
and designers to bring out 16 new
or revamped models in the past
year, including 11 in the fourth
quarter alone.
Last year at this time, many
Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep deal-
ers were wondering if they'd even
make it through the year. Sales
were down and there were few
new products on their lots. The
company needed a $12.5 billion
bailout from the government to
survive in 2009. For years, it piled
up debt and produced very few hit
cars.
Carl Galeana, who runs dealer-
ships in suburban Detroit, Florida
and South Carolina, is impressed

chionne engineered.

Of the 16 new or revamped

faster than the normal three or
four years. They include the 300

the Fiat 500 minicar.

In anticipation of
budget proposal,
Snyder talks change
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - State
and localgovernments have piled
up debt, failed to deal with fall-
ing tax revenues and racked up
around $18 billion in unfunded
pension obligations, all of which
they now must fix, Gov. Rick Sny-
der said yesterday.
He released a 21-page "Citi-
zens Guide to Michigan's
Health" that sums up Michigan's
financial challenges. Among
them are an unemployment trust
fund that's $3 billion in the red,
a widening budget gap for state
and local governments and a $2
million state rainy day fund that's
enough to keep the state running
for only 30 minutes.
The new governor said Michi-
gan faces serious problems, but
can deal with them if it has the
will.
"We will beat this. We won't
let it beatus," he told hundreds of
business leaders, elected officials
and policxymakers attending the
Business Leaders for Michigan
leadership summit at the Radis-
son hotel in downtown Lansing.
"It's not time to cry about it. It's
not time to whine about it. It's
time to go to work."
The guide is intended to fulfill

the Republican governor's cam-
paign promise to make it easier
for taxpayers to understand
where the state stands and how
it got here. Some of the informa-
tion has been available in vari-
ous state reports, but the state's
annual financial report runs to
more than 200 pages. Snyder
wanted the highlights collected
and presented in one easy-to-
read document.
"A person shouldn't have to be
a CPA or an economist to under-
stand how taxpayer dollars flow
in and out of government," he
said.
The governor didn't give spe-
cific ideas how he'll correct the
problems the report identifies,
saying those will come on Feb. 17
when he releases his proposal for
the budget year that starts Oct. 1.
But he won applause from the
audience when he vowed to get
the state on the right path once
and for all.
He also unveiled tools that
local governments and school
districts can use to produce simi-
lar reports on their spending by
plugging their numbers into' a
template.
"It's hard to see why you
wouldn't do this," he said, urging
citizens to push their local offi-
cials to prepare the reports.
The citizens guide and trans-
parency tools are available on the
governor's official state website.

A separate two-page "Michi-
gan Fiscal Scorecard" gives the
state unsatisfactory scores on
five topics, including debt lev-
els and low reserves. Instead of
having a rainy day cushion of 10
percent, state government has a
reserve of just 1.5 percent, while
local school districts as of a year
ago had about 5.2 percent of
operatingcosts in reserve.
While it will take time, Sny-
der said he wants to see all those
grades turnpositive in the future.
The citizen's guide shows how
taxes and fees are collected and
used across the state. It also lists
future bills, such as ones to pay
public employee pensions and
repay federal loans.
Michigan has about $3.1 bil-
lion in unfunded pension lia-
bilities for state government
employees and the same amount
for local government workers.
The unfunded pension liability
for school districts is $12 billion,
according to the report.
Just under half of state
employees are eligible for a
defined benefit pensionthat gives
them monthly payments when
they retireFar-moreteachers,
and local government workers
are covered by defined benefit
pensions. Over half of state work-
ers are in a defined contribu-
tion retirement system, which
includes only 401(k) investment
plans.

Foreign adoption
decreases in U.S.

Adoptions from
other countries falls
13 percent
NEW YORK (AP) - The num-
ber of foreign children adopted
by Americans fell by 13 percent
last year, reaching the lowest
level since 1995 due in large part
to a virtual halttoadoptions from,
Guatemala because of corruption
problems.
China remained America's
No. 1 source of adopted children,
accounting for 3,401, according
to figures released by the State
Department yesterday for the
2010 fiscal year. Ethiopia was
second, at 2,513, followed by Rus-
sia at 1,082 and South Korea at
863.
Guatemala was the No. 1
source country in 2008, with
4,123 adoptions by Americans.
But the number sank to 756 for
2009 and to only 51 last year as
the Central American country's
fraud-riddled adoption industry
was shut down while authorities
drafted reforms.

The overall figures for 2010
showed 11,059 adoptions from
abroad, down from 12,753 in
2009 and down more than 50
percent from the all-time peak of
22,884 in 2004.
The last time there were fewer
foreign adoptions to the U.S. was
in 1995, when there were 9,679.
The latest figures did not
include the more than 1,100 chil-
.dren airlifted from .Haiti to the
United States after the earth-
quake in January 2010. Most of
those children were in the U.S.
adoption pipeline, but the adop-
tions were not finalized by the
end of the fiscal year.
The adoptions from Ethiopia
were up by more than 200 from
2009, but adoptions from Russia
fell by about 500.
Some pending adoptions from
Russia were slowed after a Ten-
nessee adoptive mother put a
7-year-old boy on a plane back
to Moscow, unaccompanied by
an adult, in April. As a result,
U.S. officials agreed to a Russian
demand to negotiate a new, bind-
ing agreement to cover adoptions
between the two countries.

Country opens new
government, chooses
new officials
NAYPYITAW, Myanmar
(AP) - Myanmar opened its
first parliament in more than
two decades yesterday, an event
greeted with cautious optimism
by opposition lawmakers despite
the military's tight management
of the event.
The military and its allies
hold more than 80 percent
of the seats in both houses of
parliament, ensuring that the
army exercises control over the
wheels of power, as it has since
a 1962 coup deposed the last.
legitimately elected legislature.
A single-party parliament under
the late dictator Gen. Ne Win
was abolished in 1988 after the
army crushed a pro-democracy
uprising.
The 440-seat lower house
and 224-seat upper house were

opened simultaneously at 8:55
a.m. (0225 GMT) in a massive
new building in Naypyitaw, the
remote city to which the capi-
tal was moved from Yangon in
2005. The 14 regional parlia-
ments, whose members were
also elected last November,
opened at the same time.
In the afternoon, the two
houses convened together, and
legislative officers were elected,
according to Dr. Khin Shwe,
a business tycoon and upper
house representative of the jun-
ta-backed Union Solidarity and
Development Party.
Thura Shwe Mann, who had
been the junta's third-ranking
member and retired from the
military to run for election
with the USDP, was picked to
be speaker of the lower house,
and the junta's Culture Minister
Khin Aung Myint, named speak-
er of the upper house, Khin Shwe
said. The election of a vice presi-
dent was scheduled for Tuesday,
while the timing for picking a

president was not yet clear.
With its allies controlling par-
liament and loyalists - many
recently retired senior junta
members - expected to fill top
government posts, the military
will be keeping a tight grip on
power. The 2008 constitution,
drafted under the junta's guid-
ance and with provisions ensur-
ing the military's dominance,
also came into effect yesterday.
Roads leading to the parlia-
ment building were sealed off
with roadblocks manned by
armed police. Delegates wear-
ing traditional attire and repre-
sentatives of ethnic minorities
in the garb of their respective
groups were bused from state
guest houses to the site. Each bus
was checked for bombs as they
entered the compound.
Reporters, diplomats and the
public at large were barred from
witnessing the proceedings
inside. Myanmar state television
yesterday night showed footage
of the opening.

FROM TME."A,'
Rethink gun legislation
Repealing weapon restrictions isn't responsible
The tragic shooting in Tuscon, Ariz. has proponents
and opponents of gun control laws speaking up. The
debate has even made its way to Michigan in the form
of new gun control legislation that would lift restrictions on
where concealed weapons can be brought. The bill caters to
the misguided assumption that more people owning guns
will make people safer in an emergency situations. Allowing
guns in more locations jeopardizes the safety of.Michigan
residents. The state Senate needs to eliminate this bill and
consider more responsible gun legislation.

State Sen. Mike Green (R-Mayville) had
been a sponsor of a bill in 2000 that relaxed
permit requirements for concealed weapons.
The current bill would overturn restrictions
on concealed weapons in hospitals, casinos,
churches, schools, college residence halls and
classrooms and entertainment facilities with a
seating capacity of more than 2,500 persons.
The bill was introduced last week in the Sen-
ate by Green and is being reviewed, according
to a Jan. 26 Free Press article.
There are aspects of the bill that, regardless
of one's view on gun control, are simply dan-
gerous and irresponsible. Allowing parents,
administrators or any adult to have a gun on
school property could have horrible conse-
quences. The risks of allowing weapons into
places where people are drinking, where large
crowds are gathered, or both, could be cata-
strophic. This type of legislation does nothing
to protect Michigan residents from potential
dangers and creates risky situations where
violence gainst-innocent bystanders could be
possible.
The argument for revising Michigan's gun
laws is that they conflict with the constitu-
tional right to bear arms. But this logic is
flawed and takesgunpossession laws to adan-
gerous extreme. Michigan's current law ban-
ning guns in schools - and other places where
gun possession is inappropriate - isn't in vio-

lation of the Second Amendment. Therefore,
being permitted to carry a gun in a school isn't
an inherent constitutional right. The proposed
bill is creating rights that don't currently exist
and potentially puts Michigan residents in
harms way.
In the aftermath of violent, tragic events -
like the Tuscon shooting - it can be difficult
not to react in an extreme way. Those in favor
of gun control are calling for increased legis-
lation limiting where guns can be brought to
ensure safety in public places. Those opposed-
to gun control legislation are calling for - as
in the case of the bill proposed in Michigan -
fewer regulations on where concealed weap-
ons can be carried to ensure that people can
protect themselves. But both of these respons-
es are reactionary, and the aftermath of a trag-
ic event isn't the time to consider this type of
bill. Time needs to be taken to establish safe
and effective gun control legislation.
One of the only places where concealed
weapons would be banned under Michigan's
proposed gun legislation is in federal build-
ings, which happens to be where Green works.
It's not difficult to understand why he feels
comfortable with a law that keeps his work-
place safe. But for Michigan residents who
aren't comfortable with guns in their build-
ings or on their campuses, more responsible
gun legislation needs to be considered.

ast Tuesday, President
Barack Obama delivered the
annual State of the Union
address. Shortly after, as is tradi-
tion for the party
that doesn't con-
trol the execu-
tive branch, the
Republicans
issued their
response to N
Obama's speech,
selecting Wis-
consin Rep. Paul DARWEI
Ryan to address CHEN
the American
people.
In most years, after these two
speeches happen, both major political
parties rest their cases, and the politi-
cal pundits of news networks start
their analyses. However, this year is
different because someone apparent-
ly asked the Tea Party folks to weigh
in on Obama's speech too. Who asked
for their opinion?Not the GOP. House
Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA)
said sternly that "Paul Ryan's giving
the official Republican response."
The speaker for the Tea Party was
Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn),
who seemed to be distracted by
something off-camera during her
address. However, her policies were
even more off. In her remarks, she
talked about how Obama needs
to "stop the EPA from imposing a
job-destroying cap-and-trade sys-
tem." The extent to which the GOP
has flipped-flopped on this issue is
amazing. if you can remember back
just two years ago to the 2008 presi-
dential election, the McCain-Palin
ticket said explicitly that cap-and-
trade was a "market-based system to
curb greenhouse gas emissions." In
other words, cap-and-trade is a con-
servative solution to environmen-
tal problems. Again, in their words,
"it allows the market to decide and

encourage the lowest-cost compli-
ance options." Bachmann slammed
the GOP presidential ticket's envi-
ronmental policy. Of course, Obama
now wants to implement something
similar to it, which some people
think makes it "socialist."
Bachmannalsospokeaboutrepeal-
ing Obama's health care legislation
"and allowing all Americans to buy
any health care policy they like any-
where in the United States." Except,
of course, no insurance companywill
take you up if you're sick and need
help desperately. She also said the
United States is "a nation that cur-
rently enjoys the world's finest health
care" and that she believes in "excep-
tionalism in America." Let's put aside
the American exceptionalism and
look at the "finest" health care sys-
temwith statistics. The World Health
organization ranked the American
health care system 37th in the world
in 2000 (they have stopped ranking
since then because of the complex-
ity of the task). The New England
Journal of Medicine reported that in
2006, "the United States was number
one in terms of health care spending
per capita but ranked 39th for infant
mortality, 43rd for adult female mor-
tality, 42nd for adult male mortality
and 36th for life expectancy." Based
on these numbers, it seems that the
United States is only good atspending
money.
However,thepointthatcaughtmy
attention was Bachmann's remark
about "exceptionalism in America,"
which seems to be a litmus test now-
adays if you want to bea Republican.
In order to be conservative, you have
to gush about America's greatness at
every opportunity. Former Alaska
Gov. Sarah Palin has blasted Obama
many times about how he is always
"apologizing for America." In other
words, America is so exceptional
that there is nothing it has done that

deserves an apology. Really? Go tell
that to Native Americans, African
Americans, Muslims, the Japanese
and the Chinese. Since when did
apologizing become a sign of weak-
ness?
Bachmann's
response was
off-kilter.
I'm not saying that Americans
should be ashamed of where they
come from and what they do. Howev-
er, being excessively proud of things
that you have no business being
proud of is just stupid. More impor-
tantly, it hinders progress where it is
needed. When Bachmann says our
health care system is the greatest in
the world - and many GOP leaders
echo this sentiment - it clouds the
debate over what actually needs to
be done to improve the health care
industry. In addition, leaders of
other countries are angry with our
exceptionalism rhetoric because it
often carries a religious undertone
with it - "God bless America"- and
implies that America doesn't have
anything to learn from other coun-
tries. This is precisely the wrong
approach to improving this great
country of ours. The patriotic thing
to do is to take what other countries
are doing well and adapt their ideas
to improve America.
Bachmann and the Tea Party
were off-kilter with the camera on
Tuesday. Too bad that's not all that
was wrong with their State of the
Union response.

Racism shouldn't define protests

The 'U' must cut its losses
and end Survival Flight
TO THE DAILY:
Medical professionals and scientists who
are unaffiliated with the University have
overwhelmingly embraced modern simula-
tion methods to complete the training that
the University Survival Flight director states
animals must be used for (Viewpoint: Sur-
vival flight needs animal labs, 1/20/2011). It
has been disappointing that our faculty and
administrators have been willing to ignore
and distort this when attempting to describe
and defend Survival Flight's cruel exercises
on cats and pigs. Thankfully, the student
bodyunderstands this and the Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly voted overwhelmingly last
semester to end these animal labs. The Uni-
versity now just needs to swallow its pride
and join the many others who have already
made this compassionate decision.
Jonathan Coren
Ross School of Business sophomore
Lt. St. Amour's remarks about
sexual assault were offensive
TO THE DAILY:

talkpoor lightingin wake of crimes, 01/26/2011).
Included in this article were comments from
Lt. Mark St. Amour of the Ann Arbor Police
Department on how to avoid becoming a vic-
tim of crime. While it's true that there are
techniques that can help one evade being tar-
geted - like walking in groups - Lt. St. Amour
went beyond this and uses victim blaming in
regards to sexual assault.
Victim blaming is when one puts the respon-
sibility of avoiding sexual assault on the survi-
vor, rather than the perpetrator, by saying that
the survivor could have and should have done
something to avoid the assault. Victim blam-
ing is saying that when a woman was wearing
revealing clothes or was flirting, she was ask-
ing for it.
In the case of Lt. St. Amour, blame was placed on
female alcoholconsumption.Hespecificallystates,
"Sexualassaults-alotofthemthatIread-involve
alcohol,soFEMALES,watchyour alcohol."
This statement is unacceptable and never
should have been printed. It singles women
out as being responsible for sexual assaults,
when it's NEVER the survivor's fault. Why
shouldn't men also watch how much alcohol
they consume? Are they impervious to misfor-
tune while drunk?
Lt. St. Amour's remarks are offensive to not
only sexual assault survivors, but those who
support survivors and advocate for an end
to sexual violence. In a campus and city that
prides itself on its safety and inclusiveness,
comments such as these shouldn't be said,
much less printed.

Chaos. Anarchy. Looting. Violence.
These are words you associate with any political activ-
ity that you want to discredit in the eyes of mainstream
America. That's why it's essential to challenge any
attempt by the media or politicians to frame the political
protests in Egypt usingsuch terms.
We must understand why this language is particu-
larly loaded. It connects sweeping generalizations of the
Muslim world with racist fears that many Americans
associate with the urban "riots" of the 1960s, the 1992
Los Angeles uprising and the aftermath of Hurricane
Katrina.
In places like Detroit, as with cities across America,
thousands of suburbanites still wrongly believe that
everything was fine in the city until violent, extrem-
ist and hate-filled blacks forced them to flee during the
1960s. The reality is that a situation that the white middle
class viewed as normal, stable and prosperous was pre-
mised on job discrimination, housing segregation, politi-
cal disenfranchisement and police abuse against people
of color.
While not a solution, the uprisings drew overdue
attention to a dehumanizing and often violent system
that millions of Americans overtly or tacitly supported.
That's why political activists called them "rebellions"
rather than "riots." But then-President Richard Nixon's
conservative call for "law and order" fed on anxiety and
prejudice.
In Egypt, a popular protest movement that has been
widely supported by diverse and peaceful sectors of
society is seeking the downfall of the three-decade long
Mubarak dictatorship, which has quashed democratic
opposition while reaping billions of dollars in American
aid.
Yet, with millions of Americans paying, at best, curso-
ry attention to these events and the history leading up to
them, many will view Egypt primarily through the lens
of fear and misguided self-interest. Scenes of looting and
burning will be easily taken out of context unless we act
quickly to counter these trends.
In one of his trademark mash-ups of Islamophobia,
McCarthyism and xenophobia, Glenn Beck has been
warning radio listeners that revolution in Egypt "sets
the entire Middle East on fire." This will trigger "the
communists and the Muslim radicals" taking over all of
Europe. He then implies that sleeper cells will awaken to
destroy Americafrom within.
Egyptian blogger Mona Eltahawy chastised CNN -

one of the less extreme but still complicit outlets por-
traying "chaos" and "anarchy" through narratives and
footage provided by Egypt President Hosni Mubarak's
state-run media. Indeed, many Egyptians are convinced
that the Murbarak regime is instigating violence ina des-
perate hope that Egyptians will welcome a return to his
authoritarian control.
Meanwhile, the Obama administration is franti-
cally trying to change its course after first defining the
Mubarak regime as stable and then issuing equivocat-
ing statements calling for restraint on "both sides" -
one being the largely unarmed protestors and the other
being the heavily armed state police who have shown a
pattern of jailing, beating and sometimes torturing dis-
sidents.
No matter the outcome, the uprising in Egypt, follow-
ing the revolution against the United States-backed dic-
tatorship in Tunisia, has upended a pillar of American
foreign policy and caught our government flat-footed.
While steering clear of former President George Bush's
neoconservative hubris, Obama has yet to enact new
policies to matchhis loftyrhetoric about partnership and
understanding.
As my colleague Juan Cole, professor of middle east-
ern and south asian history, has pointed out, American
foreign policy in the Middle East has been stained by
"domino theory" logic - the fear that Islamic terrorists
might take over one country and expand their control
one-by-one to other countries in the region. Just as dur-
ing the Cold War, this has meant supporting autocratic
and repressive regimes while squandering opportunities
to build democratic alternatives.
This crisis provides an opportunity for all Americans
to wake up and accept responsibility for transcending the
failures of the past. We need to reject racist images that
depict legitimate protestors as savages who must be cor-
ralled.
Instead of fearing democracy, we must recall former
President John F. Kennedy's famous words: "Those who
make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revo-
lution inevitable." More than any previous generation,
those coming of age in the Obama era can now witness
the cost and consequences of a strategy predicated on
support for friendly dictators.

"In the residence halls, there
are lounges named after people of
color but ... there are no academic
or non-academic facilities named
after a person of color," Matlock
wrote.
According to the University
Housing website, within the Uni-
versity's residence halls there are
11 "minority-cultural lounges"
out of a total of 50 lounges. These
include the Rosa Parks Lounge
in Stockwell, Mahatma Gandhi
Lounge in Oxford and Martin
Luther King Jr. Lounge in Burs-
ley. There are also three "multi-
cultural theme lounges" in three
different residents halls, the web-
site states.
According to a University
Housing document titled "The
Purposes and Histories of Mul-
ticultural Theme & Minor-
ity-cultural Lounges," the
minority-cultural lounges - the
first of which was created in the
early 1970s - are meant for use
by the multicultural councils and
the Minority Peer Advisor pro-
grams in the residence halls.
"The programming and other
activities of the lounges are
directed toward federally recog-
nized students of color living in
the residence halls. These lounges
were created to provide students
of color the opportunity to inter-
act with one another in a relaxed
and open environment. They are
havens for support, solidarity and
sharing among students of color
and those interested in their con-
cerns," the document states.
The document also states, "It is
the goal of University Housing to
maintain these facilities as part
of its overall effort to support the
appreciation of diversity within
human populations, stimulate
intercultural interaction and
* understanding and provide sup-

portive environments for all stu-
dents."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald wrote in an e-mail
interview that there are few
opportunities to name buildings
after people, and it's not inten-
tional that only one building on
campus is named after a minority.
"By and large, buildings at the
University are named in honor of
past presidents and major donors
who have helped substantially to
underwrite the costs of construc-
tion," Fitzgerald wrote.
Nina Grant, director of the
University's Office of Multi-Eth-
nic Student Affairs and the Trot-
ter Multicultural Center, wrote
in an e-mail interview that she is
proud the center is named after "a
distinguished person of color."
"We are glad to be part of the
University's many and varied
efforts to advance racial and cul-
tural understanding and appre-
ciation - far beyond names
associated with buildings," she
wrote.
Jessica Thompson, the opera-
tions and event coordinator at
the Trotter Multicultural Center,
said she is honored to work in the
only University building named
after an African American.
"I feel, being an employee of
the Trotter Multicultural Center,
that I've got to fully give my all
here," Thompson said. "I've got
to really make this center known
on campus."
Thompson said the build-
ing being named after someone
belonging to a minority group is
a source of inspiration, not some-
thing to be criticized.
"It just indicates that there is
much more progress that is need-
ed," she said. "I wouldn't say I'm
disappointed, but if anything, it
should definitely indicate to all of
us here at the University of Mich-
igan that we've got to continue to
do better."
Engineering senior Sean Pres-
ton, president of the University's

chapter of the National Society of
Black Engineers, said he under-
stands why so few buildings are
named after minorities. He said
when he thinks about buildings
being named for people, the first
thing that comes to mind is indi-
viduals who have made signifi-
cant donations to the University.
"I'm not really surprised, but
with regards to the future, I think
that the first step is to get signifi-
cant people at the University ... so
we have significant contributors
to the University who are African
American," Preston said.
Still, Preston said it's more
important to increase underrep-
resented minority enrollment at
the University rather than focus
on who campus buildings are
named for.
"Personally, I would rather see
more people here from under-
represented communities than
buildings," he said. "I'd be more
interested in seeing people come
to the University as hired (admin-
istrators) or tenured faculty than
buildings. (Buildings are) the
next step."
Currently, underrepresented
minority student enrollment
is at 10.6 percent of the Uni-
versity's freshman class - an
increase from last year's 9.1
percent, according to a Oct. 25,
2010 Michigan Daily article. But
according to the article, the rise
may be attributed to a change in
the gathering and reporting of
data as mandated by the Higher
Education Opportunity Act.
LSA junior Ryanna Robin-
son, president of the community
service student group the Black
Volunteer Network, said she
isn't surprised there is just one
building named after a minority.
She added that this lack of rep-
resentation reflects the campus
community's deficiency in recog-
nition of minority individuals.
"I just think the University as a
whole needs to acknowledge peo-
ple of color more," she said.

INTERNSHIPS
From Page 1
in every school at the University
- is often one of the first stops
for students in their search for
summer internship positions.
"Certainly we're busy, and
we like it that way," Harclerode
said.
This year's search has prov-
en to be just as competitive, if
not more, than in past years,
according to Harclerode. This is
particularly the case for upper-
classmen, she said, which is the
demographic the Career Center
tends to work with most often.
While some students have
already heard back from the
places they've applied to, many
are now sending resum6s and
filling out online applications,
according to Harceirode.
Some of the most popular
areas of interest for student
interns are advertising and mar-
keting, public service and pre-
health, Harclerode said. She
added that this year she's seen
an increased interest in social
media, an internship field that
didn't exist a few years ago.
The number of students look-
ingfor entrepreneurship-related
internships has also increased,
she said, mentioning MPowered
as a program that has seen a rise
in student interest.
MPowered, a University
organization that encourages
students to explore entrepre-

neurship and create their own
companies, has become more
prevalent on campus in recent
years. Along with working with
entrepreneurship competi-
tions, MPowered also assembles
events to encourage student
innovation, including Global
Entrepreneurship Week, Start-
up Weekend and a career fair
that will take place on Feb. 9.
While the number of students
looking for summer internships
continues to be up, Harclerode
said the economy is more of a
concern for students on the hunt
this year than in the past. Stu-
dents looking for internships in
cities like Los Angeles and New
York may be concerned about
the high cost of living in those
areas, she said.
But the Career Center has
several suggestions for students
with financial concerns. Har-
clerode said students who have
apprehensions about accepting
an unpaid internship can intern
several days a week and also
work part-time or intern for the
half the summer and work the
other half.
"I'm a firm believer that an
internship shouldn't be some-
thing that is only for the haves,
and not the have-nots," she said.
One of the tools Harclerode
said students have utilized this
year is an online internship
database called the Career Cen-
ter Connector.
Kinesiology sophomore Paul
Kitti said the Career Center

Connector has been the most
beneficial tool in his search for
an internship in a sports-relat-
ed field. Kitti is looking for a
summer internship for the first
time and started his search in
December. He said he has sent
out his resume and has already
heard back from one company.
LSA junior Chatoris Jones
said she's found the online tool
extremely advantageous as well.
"It is the biggest help I've
ever had," Jones said.
The Career Center also offers
a feature called iPlan, which
allows students to visualize
all the steps of the internship
search process and to under
stand what they want to get out
of a possible internship.
Though students tend to
use the Career Center's ser-
vices later on in their college
careers, Harclerode said stu-
dents often say they wish they
had come in earlier. The Career
Center encourages students to
start taking advantage of their
resources as early as freshman
year, she said.
Jones said she feels pressure
to get an internship this sum-
mer since she's an upperclass-
man now.
"This year, especially because
I am a junior, it's extremely
competitive because I feel like
I'm running out of- time," she
said. "A message to everyone is
just to get out there and go for
it. Definitely start connecting
now."


FIRE
From Page 1
of students, sent an e-mail yes-
terday to University students
who graduated from Commu-
nity High School acknowledging
Rachford's death, and offering
condolences to campus com-
munity members who may have
known him.
"While the deceased was not
a University of Michigan stu-
dent, we know that many current
students may know them from
high school," Javier wrote in the
e-mail. "We are very sorry for

this tragic, sudden loss and we
would like to offer support."
The e-mail stated that the
University is offering assistance
to any students mourning the
loss, and pointed out resources
on campus like the University's
Counseling and Psychological
Services, as well as CAP's Ken's
Place, a support organization
for students who experience the
death of a loved one.
"Should you need support in
contacting your academic unit or
would like to speak to a counsel-
or, please let us know and we can
help to connect you to the most
appropriate resources on cam-

pus," Javier wrote.
Two other individuals were
in the house when the fire broke
out, but they were able to escape
before- firefighters reached the
house, Lanzasaid.
Lt. Mark St. Amour of the
Ann Arbor Police Department
said yesterday afternoon that he
couldn't release the names of the
other individuals involved in the
fire.
St. Amour said the AAPD is
working with other officers to aid
the AAFD in investigating the fire.

ENROLLMENT
From Page 1
Despite more students pay-
ing tuition, the policy has been
revenue neutral for the Univer-
sity, Weiss said, as tuition was
lowered to ensure the University
wasn't profiting from the added
students enrolled each semester.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman said in an inter-
view in December that she
hadn't heard any complaints
about the new continuous
enrollment policy.
"I think the fact that I haven't
heard anything about it is a
really good sign," Coleman said.
"As I understand, -we've had a
pretty smooth transition. We've
protected those students who
would've been affected adversely
by this. We have many more stu-

dents now registered so we can
monitor them and follow them
and make sure they're making
progress. My sense is that every-
one is happy."
University Provost Philip
Hanlon said in an interview last
month that he spoke with Weiss
in late December about the pol-
icy, and she told him everything
was going well.
"What we had when we insti-
tuted continuous enrollment is
they had modeled a growth in
enrollment of doctorate candi-
dates, and the actual growth is
dead on to what they predicted,"
Hanlon said. "That part seems
to be working really smoothly.
Dean Weiss reported almost no
sort of complaints, problems or
issues in terms of students hav-
ing the support they need to be
enrolled."
But before the implementa-

tion, some students were upset
they would only be allowed to
take leaves of absence under cer-
tain approved circumstances like
health problems, family emer-
gencies, pregnancy and military
service.
However, Weiss said only 74
students took a leave of absence
last fall.
Students who want to take
a leave of absence that isn't
approved can petition the Rack-
ham administration to get con-
sent. They also have the optionto
resolve the dispute in front of an
appeal board of students and fac-
ulty. The board - established by
the school's administration and
Rackham Student Government -
has yet to hear a case, Weiss said.
"So far we have not had even
a single dispute, so I'm hopeful
that that means people feel like
the policy is being implemented

in ways that are fair and reason-
able," Weiss said. "If they're not,
they'll come forward because we
have people who can help."
However, several faculty
members, including Gina Poe,
an associate professor at the
University's Medical School and
vice chair for the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs, raised concerns to Weiss
and other University adminis-
trators when the policy was pro-
posed.
"The problem is that these
boards don't know the students
and their life situations and the
reasons why the students might
feel like this is the best decision
for them and their community,"
Poe said at SACUA's Dec. 17,
2009 meeting. "It puts them in
an ivory tower in these very per-
sonal, very difficult and some-
times complicated decisions of

whether someone should take
leave from their studies."
Weiss said that a small number
of disputes were resolved before
the appeals process was created.
"There have been issues that
have come up, but we've been
able to make sure that students
are in their right status," Weiss
said. "So if they should be on
leave, they are on leave; if they
should be enrolled, then they are
enrolled; and if they need to be
supported, then they get the sup-
port they need. So there's been
a lot individual problem solving
that needed to happen, which
we expected and we've been pre-
pared for."
A survey of graduate stu-
dents conducted last September
revealed most students were
content with the continuous
enrollment policy and said they
anticipated it wouldn't affect

them, accordingto Weiss.
"The policy was sort of just
coming into implementation at
that moment (the survey was
taken), and we wanted to know
whether students knew about
the policy because not 411 stu-
dents know about all the aca-
demic policies," Weiss said.
A few of the students surveyed
did express some concern that
the policy would affect them,
specifically by preventig them
from researching or studying
abroad, Weiss said.
"We are working with those
departments to make sure that
is not the case and that those
students have exactly the same
opportunities to do their work
abroad as they always had and
that the departments are pro-
viding the necessary tuition
support so students can do
that," she said.

What's lost in translation

'Today' not so special

W riting about music
is tough.
When I talk to
people about writing this col-
umn, the conversation usually
goes like
this:
Me: (not
looking
them in the
eyes) Yeah,
I write a
column for
the Daily. JOE
Person: DIMUZIO
Oh, so you
can write
about, like, whatever?
Me: Yeah, pretty much.
Person: That sounds easy/
fun/cool/sneeze.
Me: Yeah, well ...
But what I'd like to tell them
is that writing this column is
like fighting a civil war with
myself. It's a constant and a
sometimes half-assed campaign
to reach some impossible way-
point, inwhich I capture what
I actually "mean" about the
music I listen to, how I listen to
it and how it makes me "feel."
Ugh. Feeling. It's an enemy,
among so many others. One
that has to be fought.
Did I join the Daily two
years ago because I like music?
Yep. Do I like to write? Sure.
But ultimately, I took the leap
from picking up (and promptly
forgetting to recycle) the Daily
and Daily Arts in particular to
writing for it because I didn't
like what I read. I wanted to
get better at writing, share my
hot and fuzzies about music
with some like-minded dweebs
and print something I could
tolerate reading.
I didn't know how grueling
it would be. From the onset
of joining the Daily, the big-
gest and most terrifying editor
and critic I had was me. Now,
with every step, sentence and
day that moves toward my
deadline, I second-guess it
all. Music. Songs. "Feelings."

Mandvi film puts
the right ingredients
in the wrong mix
By WILL DEFEBAUGH
For the Daily
When cooking, there's one ingre-
dient always necessary to make
the perfect plate. Without this one
ingredient, the
entire meal is
guaranteed to
fall apart. T
This ingre-
dient is bal- At the Michigan
ance. Each
individual Reliance MediaWorks
component of
a recipe can be perfectly delectable
in its own right, but it's how these
ingredients are proportioned that
makes a dish so exquisite.
The same logic can also be
applied to films. Story, setting,
characters, direction, themes and
motifs - all of these different com-
ponents must be properly balanced
to have a memorable film. Without
this equilibrium, the result can be
a movie that comes across far too
strong.
Such is the case for "Today's
Special," starring Aasif Mandvi
(TV's "The Daily Show"), Dean
Winters (TV's "30 Rock") and Jess
Weixler ("Teeth").
The movie follows Samir (Man-
dvi), a dispassionate middle-aged
man whose cooking career seems
to be going nowhere. After quit-
ting his job as a sous-chef upon
being told that he will never have
the "magic" "required to be a chef,
Samir is ready to go to Paris and
study under the best chefs in


"What do you mean I'm not special?"
France. Unfortunately for Samir,
his father has a heart attack the
week before his departure, forcing
Samir to stay home and take care
of the family restaurant - and go
back on his oath to never cook Indi-
an food. Throw in a dead brother,
a Yoda-like taxi driver, quirky
staff members and an unexpected
romance, and there you have it:
"Today's Special."
While each of these ingredients
has potential, they're unfortunate-
ly squandered due to poor delivery.
Lines that could be hilarious fall
flat because of inadequate timing
and direction. The characters that
actually make the movie worth-
while, like Samir's mother, are not
given enough airtime. Scenes that
call for straightforward camera-
work are weakened by focusing
experimentation that comes across
as out-of-place.
Correct ingredients, incorrect
balance.
Still, the themes of failure,
family, forgotten heritage and
the unexpectedness of life are
heartwarming. The development
of Samir's romance with Carrie

(Weixler) and the scene in which
Samir finally confronts his fears
are moving. They would just be
more moving if there were a bit less
of camp and a dash more of subtle-
ty. A theme - like a flavor - should
never be overly stated.
This kind of misstep is all too
common in Hollywood. Movies
that have allthe makings of a smart
and poignant film flop because the
pieces are not prepared correctly.
For a film to be successful, each
component must be in complete
harmony. Without this balance,
the movie loses that "magic" qual-
ity that allows it to stand above the
rest.
Instead of capitalizing on the
witty dialogue, universal themes
and unique characters, the film
wastes them in a mundane and
formulaic capacity, ultimately pro-
ducing a run-of-the-mill feel-good
comedy that has been made a hun-
dred times over.
Near the beginning ofethe movie,
Samir is told that he is too "text-
book" to ever be a brilliant chef.
This mayas well have been a meta-
phor for the whole film.

ALBUM RTEVIEW
Go. Team rocky on Rolling

By ARIELLE SPECINER
DailyArts Writer
"Skins" isn't the only insane
import from across the pond
hitting the states recently.
Enter The
Go! Team,
a British
powerhouse The Go! Team
group ready
to take the Rolling Blackouts
U.S. by Memphis Industries
storm with
its third stu-
dio album, Rolling Blackouts.
Like the characters from the
provocative British television
show, the latest album from
The Go! Team parties until
it blacks out. Back with more
hard-hitting melodies and
trash bag party antics, The Go!
Team is ready for some fun. The
album features special guests
like Deerhoof's Satomi Matsu-
zaki and Best Coast's Bethany
Cosentino, adding even more
pizzazz to the festive album.
Not much has changed since
the band's last record, 2007's
Proof of Youth - seriously,
almost nothing. The tracks on
its older album could easily be
substituted for those on the
newest, and vice versa.
The head-banging band
strikes with loud, baroque
tracks and playful beats. Roll-
ing Blackouts starts off as a
bundle of hipster-hop fun
with "T.O.R.N.A.D.O." - a
playground chant mix led by
Nkechi Ka Egenamba, a vocal-
ist who goes by Ninja, backed
by a marching band. It has the
energy of a high school football
game, warped into a song.
The energetic bash doesn't
end there. "Apollo Throwdown"
packs a punch with a glittery
dance backing track and a spar-
kling beat. It sounds like a sub-
dued M.I.A., but has enough
spunk to rival Gwen Stefani.
Though these tracks are fun to
listen to, the band veers a bit off-
course. Many of the songs on

Too many blackouts, or too much rolling.

You're seated in a breakfast
nook with your significant other.
Blueberry-granola pancakes sit in
front of you, the
Sunday morning
light is stream- *
ing through the Amos Lee
cracked win-
dows and Amos Mission Bell
Lee'sMissionBell
resounds from Blue Note
the corner of
the living room - sufficient back-
ground music. Unpunctuated by
diverse chords or lyrics, and not
nearly as gut-punching as his past
three albums, Amos Lee's latest is
a bit of a let-down, but more disap-
pointingly, a love-down.
Lee's perpetually soothing
vocals live in more of a Southern
register throughout the 13 tracks,
dominated by relationship down-
fall and religious imagery. The
second song, "Windows Are Rolled
Down," is the single memorable
hook on the album. The four other
hooks are solidly beautiful and the
rest could be done without - even
if the pancakes are to die for.
Lee takes a chance with a blue-
sier sound on the track "Jesus,"
accompanied by vocalist James
Gadson. The truly terrible track
clashes deeply with Lee's thun-
dering country vocals repeating,
"Oh Jesus can you help me now /
No I never felt so alone." It seems
that Jesus would be less interested
in uplifting Lee from his women
problems than in helping him to
rediscover his musical prowess.
It appears Lee has gone slightly
off-kilter from the numerous soul-
based genres under his Philadel-
phian belt, but "Learned a Lot,"
"Cup of Sorrow" and "Violin" save
us from completely discarding the
broken-hearted, scruffy angel with
a jawline sharper than his own F
sharp.
A glimpse of sunshine within
Lee's introspective and mostly
somber album is "Learned a Lot,"
which takes you to a sweetly nos-
talgic mindset, Starbucks cup
warmingyour palm, as his acoustic
strings warm the rest of you with
"I've been crying / But my crying
is through." "Cup of Sorrow" is full
of sorrow, but it's the brand that
we all hate to love. Standout track
"Violin" is a gorgeous statemhent
of sound from both Lee and guest
Sam Beam of Iron & Wine that
brings us back to classic Amos Lee.

Vacuuming Mission Bell into the
gray abyss of mediocre records are
Lee's over-simplified, forgettable
lyrics. The album is peppered with
scene-describing poetic phrases
that could have only been appre-
ciated at the time of their creation
(probably by good ol' Adam and
Eve) - distant shores, unknown
coasts, rolling highways, heaven's
gate and dark nights.
Fifteen percent of the album is
devoted to "El Camino" - Lee's
original opening song on Mission
Bell and the concluding reprise,
accompanied by Willie Nelson.
Though the collaboration rounds
the album off reverently, it also

as producer. industry is youth dominated.

For whom does
this 'Bell' toll?
Mission Bell is more of a fail-
ure than a success; Lee took a risk
and there are an overwhelming
number of throwaways, but "Win-
dows Are Rolled Down" and "Vio-
lin" could easily slink their way
into your recently played. So run
away to a distant shore with those
redeeming songs and life will be
just smashing.

Hunwick's stellar play continues in loss

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
DETROIT - The No. 6 Michi-
gan hockey team's bench was a
little more crowded than usual
Saturday night. Senior goaltender
Bryan Hogan
was in uniform NOTEBOOK
for the first time
since his groin injury on Dec. 11.
While Hogan joined freshman
Adam Janecyk in standing behind
the bench, it was still senior Shawn
Hunwick who was between the
pipes.
He didn't disappoint. Hunwick
made 28 stops in the Wolverines'
2-1 loss to Michigan State, includ-
ing 22 on the Spartans' first 22
shots. The game was scoreless
late into the second period and as
each minute ticked by, Hunwick
matched his counterpart, Michi-
gan State's Will Yanakeff. Each

gave up goals in the final minute,
setting the stage for the third peri-
od.
After a Michigan State goal,
Michigan turned the puck over. A
backhand pass came out from the
boards and Hunwick found him-
self alone with Spartan Kevin Wal-
rod. Hunwick made the pad save,
setting up the rush that led to a
penalty shot on the other end:
"I thinkthe chancesthey had on
Hunwick might have been tougher
than the chances we had at the
other end," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "Hunwick gave us a
chance. That's all you can ask."
Despite the loss dropping his
record to 10-5-4, Hunwick also
dropped his goals against average
to 2.33, though he still ranks 27th
in the country.
NO MORE STREAKING: It's
been a long time since sullen faces
emerged from the Michigan dress-

ing room.
The sixth-ranked Wolverines,
a team Michigan State coach Rick
Comley called the "bestteaminthe
country, top to bottom," snapped a
numberstreaks with their loss.
Their five game winning streak
is gone. Senior forward Carl Hage-
lin's nine-game point streak is over.
Michigan's undefeated streak on
Saturday nights, which lasted the
whole season, is over at 13 games.
But according to senior forward
Louie Caporusso, who snapped a
streak of his own when he scored
his first goal in seven games, the
streaks may have been a little mis-
leading.
"We want to be a CCHA playoff
team, CCHA regular season cham-
pionship team, we're going to have
to beat these teams," senior winger
Scooter Vaughan said. "This is a
really big weekend (at Miami).
We're not going in there expecting

anythingless than six points."
The loss that snapped the streak
also dropped Michigan out of first
place. Notre Dame's shootout win
vaulted them over Michigan by one
point. But the Wolverines have two
games in hand on both the Fight-
ing Irish and third-place Miami
(Ohio). Michigan heads to Oxford
next weekend to play the Red-
Hawks while Notre Dame has the
weekend off.
NOTES: The loss evens Michi-
gan's season series with the Spar-
tans at two ... Saturday's game
was likely the last Comely will
have against the Wolverines. He
announced his retirement at the
end of the season this week and
won't play Michigan again in the
regular season ... Kevin Lynch's
penalty shot in the third period
was the first since now-senior
defenseman Chad Langlais had
one last season - 66 games ago.

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily

On a team with no seniors and Vogrich tallied 11 3-pointers for
three freshmen starters, it is no Michigan last year. This season he

has already netted 18 and is shoot-
ing atla consistent 39 percent from
beyond the arc.
With freshman Tim Hardaway
Jr. starting the entire season at the
three-guard position, it has been
Vogrich has come in for Hardaway
Jr. when he's needed rest or is in
foul trouble. Being smaller than a
lot of his defenders, Vogrich sports
a striking resemblance to team-
mate Zack Novak, who had the
same issue playing as the four in
the post last year.
Novak - best known for his
hustle plays that aren't recorded
on the stat sheet - has been one
of the Wolverines' top defenders.
Vogrich has demonstrated the
same type of hustle on the court
as Novak - several times this
season he has dove for loose balls
and fought for possession with
players much larger than him.
"Zack (Novak) is ,just one of
those guys who work hard every
play," Vogrich said earlier in this
season. "How can I not try to
play like him? He put's 110 per-
cent into everything that he does
and I'mjust a lot like him."
This year, Vogrich has eight
steals and a block - already more
than what he had last year in
both categories.
Given Beilein's strategy,
Vogrich is normally on the hard-

wood to take advantage of any
open looks he gets on the perim-
eter - the reason 47 of his 66 field
goal attempts are 3-point shots.
But every now and then you'll see
Vogrich do something out of the
ordinary. He averages about two
rebounds a game. Arguably his
most impressive stunt was against
Northwestern, when he came from
3-point land to tip in a bricked shot
before it rolled off the rim.
"It was just a good bounce so I
just hit it with my righthand and it
rolled off the glass,"he said.
This type of hustle followed
other plays by Vogrich which have
shaped games. Against Penn State,
Vogrich hit a 3-pointer about five
minutes into the second half to tie
the game after the Nittany Lions
led by as many as nine points.Then
Vogrich stole the ball and that pos-
session propelled the Wolverines
to its first lead of the second half.
"It definitely started with Matt
Vogrich," Novak said after the
Wolverines win against Penn
State. "He comes out, we had just
scored a bucket, he comes back,
gets a steal right away. That's the
kind of energy plays we need. Just
huge play fromhim."
The energy that Vogrich brings
to this youthful Wolverine squad
is something that was otherwise
absent last year.

I had it all written in my head.
After the Michigan women's
basketball team upset then-No.
24 Ohio State for the second time
this season and vaulted into a
four-way tie for first place in the
Big Ten on
Thursday, I KEVIN
figured the RAFTERY
Wolverines
wr wel On Women's
were well Baskebl
on their way B
to their first
NCAA tournament berth since
2001 and possibly their first Big
Ten title since ... ever - and I
was goingto let everybody know
about it.
Suddenly, Michigan had the
chance to be a basketball school
again. A women's basketball
school. Okay, maybe that's a little
bit of a stretch, but maybe stu-
dents on campus would recog-
nize the names Veronica Hicks
or Carmen Reynolds as Michigan
basketball players, not just the
girls sitting next to them in class.
I'd present my case of why this
team is worth watching, and the
campus would go into a women's
basketball frenzy (it doesn't hurt
to dream) - the first ever in Ann
Arbor.
But then Sunday rolled around,
and the Wolverines headed to
Minneapolis to take on the Big
Ten bottom-dwelling Golden
Gophers. I was so convinced
they'd win that I already had half
of my story written before tipoff.
As you may have guessed by
now, Minnesota beat Michigan
(6-3 Big Ten, 13-8 overall) hand-
ily, as the Golden Gophers led the
entire game en route to a 60-50
victory.
And just like that, there went
my brilliant idea for a story. How
could I make a plug for a team
that just lost tothe worst team in
the league?
The answer: I couldn't. But I
could do something else.
In my eyes, there are two
women's basketball teams inAnn
Arbor (yes, your dream has come
true).
First, there's the team who
lost to Minnesota on Sunday.
That's the team that turns the
ball over four times before final-
ly converting its first field goal,

the team who gets out-hustled,
out-rebounded, and "out-phys-
icalled," as Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth called it after the
Minnesota game. And it's the
team who simply doesn't have
the resilience to come back when
it's down.
It's the same team who got
smoked at home by Detroit - a
team at the bottom of the Hori-
zon League standings - earlier
in the season.
And then there's the team who
stormed back from a 13-point
halftime deficit last Thursday to
beat Ohio State in Columbus to
complete its first series sweep of
the Buckeyes in programhistory.'
That's the team that has play-
ers who step up in big-time
moments - players like sopho-
more Rachel Sheffer, who scored
acareer-high23 pointsinColum-
bus and nailed two pressure-
packed free throws with under
30 seconds left to give Michigan
the jead.
It's a team with players like
Hicks (I'm convinced her picture
is in the dictionary under "senior
leader"), who led her team to
four straight victories and tothe
top of the conference standings
en route to her first-career Big
Ten Player of the Week award.
It's an undersized team who
annoys the hell out of bigger
opponents, often putting three
or four players on the block;
swatting the ball at every oppor-
tunity. It's the team that held
three-time Big Ten Player of the
Year Jantel Lavender to a career-
low 10 points last Thursday.
It's the team who beat three
ranked teams in consecutive
games in December.
That team is fun to watch. And
for the most part, it's been that
team who has resided in Ann
Arbor so far this year.
But with three of Michigan's
next five games coming against
the Big Ten leaders - start-
ing with Penn State at home
on Thursday - the question
remains.
Do the Wolverines have what
it takes to earn their first NCAA
berth in 10 years?
There's one Michigan wom-
en's basketball team that does.
