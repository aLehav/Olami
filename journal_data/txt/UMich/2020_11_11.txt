Students took to State Street 

to celebrate after Joe Biden was 
declared the winner of the 2020 
presidential election on Saturday.

LSA sophomore Grace Timmer 

said that after such a close race, it 
was relieving to see the results 
this morning and the community 
support this afternoon.

“I am elated to be here and see 

all the support for Biden,” Timer 

said. “It’s amazing after the tight 
election to see everyone come out 
and take a deep breath.”

Timmer isn’t the only one who 

is optimistic. 

President-elect 
Biden 

preached hope as he accepted 
his new job alongside Vice 
President-elect Kamala Harris 
before a crowd at Chase Center 
in Wilmington, Del., Saturday 
night.

It was the pair’s first public 

appearance since the Associated 

Press projected that former Vice 
President Biden and Sen. Harris, 
D-Calif., would become the 46th 
president and 49th vice president 
of the United States, respectively. 

“With full hearts and steady 

hands, with faith in America 
and in each other, with a love of 
country and a thirst for justice, 
let us be the nation that we know 
we can be,” Biden said. “A nation 
united. A nation strengthened. A 
nation healed. The United States 
of America.”

Biden 
emphasized 
his 

commitment to unity during 
these politically polarizing times 
and pledged to be a president for 
all Americans.

“Now for all those of you who 

voted for President Trump, I 
understand your disappointment 
tonight,” Biden said. “I’ve lost a 
couple of times myself, but now 
let’s give each other a chance.” 

Six years after police shot 

and killed Aura Rosser, a 
Black woman, in her Ann 
Arbor home, hundreds of 
students 
and 
community 

members gathered in front 
of city hall for a vigil in her 
memory.

Deborah Carter, Rosser’s 

mother, spoke publicly for the 
first time since her daughter’s 
death. 
Surrounded 
by 

family members including 

Aura Rosser’s cousins and 
daughter, Carter described 
Rosser as an artist and a very 
lovable person. 

“Unfortunately, the police 

chose to shoot her in the 
heart rather than in the foot 
because she was in a rage, 
they say, but there was no 
need to murder my baby,” 
Carter said.

Ann Arbor police officers 

Mark Raab and David Ried 
responded 
to 
a 
911 
call 

at Rosser’s home in Ann 
Arbor 
about 
a 
domestic 

disturbance on Nov. 10, 2014. 
Police arrived at the scene 
and 
were 
confronted 
by 

Rosser, a 40-year-old mother 
of three. After Rosser was 
seen holding a knife and was 
within 6 to 10 feet of the 
officers, Raab unholstered 
his taser and Ried drew his 
firearm. 

Both 
officers 
deployed 

their weapons. Rosser died 
shortly after being shot in 
the chest. According to Raab, 
no more than a few seconds 
passed between the time 
officers entered the house, 
and Ried fatally shot Rosser, 
according 
to 
documents 

released by the Washtenaw 
Prosecutor’s Office in 2015.

“This officer yelled ‘stop’ 

and fired the taser at Rosser, 
fearing for officer safety,” 
Raab 
said. 
“Officer 
Ried 

fired his sidearm at nearly 
the same time. The time from 
when officers first entered 
the house and yelled ‘police’ 
to when she was shot and 
Tasered was approximately 
5-to-10 seconds.”

Sunday night’s vigil drew 

hundreds to city hall. Lisa 
Jackson, 
a 
University 
of 

Michigan alum who serves 
as the head of ICPOC, or 
the Ann Arbor Independent 
Community Police Oversight 
Commission, spoke to the 
lack 
of 
awareness 
about 

Rosser’s killing in the Ann 
Arbor community she’s seen 
on the oversight board.

“You see, every time a 

Black person is killed by 
police and it makes national 
news, we get bombarded 
with emails asking, ‘Could 
this happen in Ann Arbor?’” 
Jackson said. “And you all 
know the problem with this 
right? It’s already happened 
in Ann Arbor.”

Jackson 
chairs 
the 

oversight commission, which 
was formed in the wake of 
Rosser’s death in an effort led 
by community members and 
local activists. After applying 

and being appointed to the 
post, Jackson found that a 
major part of her role on the 
body was acknowledging the 
distrust and tension between 
police and members of the 
community.

“I know police officers, 

and I understand there are 
some 
really 
good 
police 

officers,” Jackson said. “I 
also understand that African 
Americans in this community 
don’t feel like we’re treated 
exactly the same. We don’t 
have that expectation. And 
so I know that there’s a

ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Administration 
informed 

students of campus plans for 
the winter semester on Nov. 
6 — days after the 14-day stay-
in-place order ended and amid 
the ongoing stress of the 2020 
election.

In 
the 
announcement, 

University 
of 
Michigan 

President Mark S. Schlissel 
outlined 
a 
plan 
that 

includes an increase in both 
asymptomatic 
testing 
and 

remote classes.

The 
announcement 

indicates that students living 
in dorms will not have their 
housing contracts renewed 
for winter semester except 
for pressing circumstances, 
with dorm rooms moving to 
single occupancy. All students 
were encouraged to remain at 
their permanent residence if 
possible.

LSA 
freshman 
Macy 

Hannan said she and some 
of her friends were looking 
for an off-campus apartment, 
but that supply was limited. 
Hannan said she felt the 
University has gone “too far.” 

Hannan also worried that 
some of the friendships she 
made this semester would be 
negatively impacted by the 
plan for next semester.

“Community-wise, I feel 

like people will be more 
isolated in their bubbles next 
semester,” Hannan said. “I feel 
like a lot of huge community 
aspects, like the few in-person 
things you’re supposed to go 
to or just talking to neighbors 
in the hall are going to 
disappear without the dorms. 
So many of your friendships 
are just random ones that you 
make walking to the elevator 
or brushing your teeth.” 

Ayden 
Makar, 
an 
LSA 

freshman 
living 
in 
South 

Quad Residence Hall, said he 
hoped next semester would be 
better, but he wasn’t surprised 
by the University’s decision. 
Makar, an in-state student, 
said he will be living at 
home next semester and was 
worried about “FOMO” (fear 
of missing out) and adjusting 
to living at home after having 
a taste of college. He also said 
he 
thought 
asymptomatic 

testing should have started 
fall semester.

Washtenaw 
County 

reported record levels of 
voter turnout this election, 
according to the Washtenaw 
County elections site. 

Nearly 19,600 Ann Arbor 

residents out of the more 
than 
42,000 
registered 

voters across the city cast a 
ballot in the election, a voter 
turnout rate of nearly 50%. 
Students also turned out at 
a rate of around 15% in Ann 
Arbor, with 7,368 expected 
student ballots cast.

The 
Michigan 
Daily 

obtained 
voting 
rate 

predictions from Neighbors 
for 
Democracy, 
an 

organization 
aimed 
at 

increasing 
voter 
turnout 

in 
Ann 
Arbor 
for 
the 

2020 
election. 
Final 

results demonstrated that 
turnout outperformed the 
organization’s 
original 

predictions 
by 
16% 
for 

registrations and 10% for 
votes cast. Neighbors for 
Democracy predicted that 

7,368 students would cast 
ballots, with numbers from 
the University of Michigan 
Museum 
of 
Art 
satellite 

polling station. 

Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Clerk 

Jacqueline 
Beaudry 

said 
there 
were 
5,412 

registrations 
and 
8,501 

ballots turned in at the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

Museum of Art, a satellite 
polling station that opened 
in late September. 

According to a Michigan 

Daily survey of nearly 1,900 
students from last month, 
out of the 1,845 University 
students registered to vote, 
only 33.3% were registered 
in the city of Ann Arbor.

Overall, 
nearly 
20,000 

ballots were cast from all 
five wards. As of now, it 
is 
estimated 
that 
about 

7,368 
University 
students 

cast their ballots in Ann 
Arbor for the 2020 general 
election.

In 
2016, 
about 
16,740 

students voted in the general 
election out of about 25,557 
who were registered. 

Grace Hermann, president 

of the University’s chapter 
of College Democrats, wrote 
in a statement to The Daily 
that students recognized the 
importance of their vote in 
this election and that efforts 
by 
student 
organizations 

helped 
increase 
voter 

turnout.

“In general, I think a 

lot of students on campus 
understood 
how 
much 

their vote meant this year, 
especially in a state as 
critical 
as 
Michigan, 
so 

it was really exciting to 
see young people not only 
stepping up and voting but 
also stepping up to make 
phone calls, send texts and 
volunteer to get out the 
vote,” Hermann said.

K.P. Unnikrishnan is a 

volunteer at Neighbors for 
Democracy, an organization 
that aimed to increase voter 
turnout in Ann Arbor for the 
2020 election.

Washtenaw County sees record

U-M released its plans for the winter semester Friday. 

ADVERTISING

WMG-contact@umich.edu 

On Friday, the University 

released plans for the Winter 
2021 semester. Here’s what you 
need to know.

What does this mean for 

housing?

Undergraduate 
students 

currently 
living 
in 
the 

residence halls will have their 
housing contracts canceled. To 
live on-campus next year, they 
will have to apply for housing. 
The 
University 
has 
listed 

health concerns, financial and 
academic needs, international 
status, employment as Housing 
ResStaff and other extenuating 
circumstances 
as 
potential 

justifications 
for 
living 
in 

the 
dorms. 
The 
University 

will only house one student 
per room in residence halls. 
The 
specific 
process 
for 

reapplying will be shared with 
on-campus students. Graduate 
and professional students can 
continue living in their current 
housing because of low case 
numbers in their communities.

Most 
undergraduates, 

including 
those 
living 

off-campus, 
are 
strongly 

encouraged to stay at their 
permanent 
residences 
and 

access instruction remotely.

Will there still be in-person 

classes?

Yes, but only classes more 

effectively taught in person or 
essential to licensure will meet 
in person, continuing with the 
University’s 
guidance 
since 

the stay-in-place order. No 
instructor will be required to 
teach in person. There will be 
fewer hybrid classes because of 
feedback from instructors on 
the format’s difficulty. 

What 
will 
COVID-19 

testing look like?

Undergrads 
living 
in 

residence 
halls, 
attending 

in-person classes or activities, 
using U-M buildings, working 
or doing research on campus 
will undergo mandatory weekly 
testing. Other students, faculty 
and staff will have access to 
weekly asymptomatic testing. 
Residence halls will require 
students to test negative for 
COVID-19 before moving in or 
out. Overall, the University said 
there will be “major increases 
in asymptomatic testing for 
all members of the campus 
community.”

How will public health 

policies be enforced?

The University will take 

a 
stricter, 
no-tolerance 

approach 
to 
public 
health 

policy violations. Gatherings 
of three or more in residence 

halls will result in automatic 
probation, and students who 
violate policies in quarantine or 
isolation housing will have their 
housing contract terminated. 
Off-campus 
students 
who 

violate COVID-19 restrictions 
will be referred to the Office 
of Student Conflict Resolution 
and/or the Washtenaw County 
Health Department.

Will there be a spring 

break?

While Spring Break is still 

canceled for the Winter 2021 
semester, the University will 
have two mid-week, one day 
“well-being breaks” on Feb. 
24 and March 23 without any 
scheduled academic activities. 

Will 
the 
University 

buildings still be open?

Yes, the libraries, Unions and 

recreational sports buildings 
will remain open in the winter 
semester, though hours will 
be modified. Lounge spaces 
in University Housing will be 
available through reservation-
only.

Will the dining halls offer 

dine-in services?

No. 
Dining 
halls 
will 

continue to offer “grab-and-go” 
dining only. 

What 
mental 
health 

resources will be offered?

Counseling 
and 

Psychological 
Services 
will 

expand their staff by eight new 

counselors to combat long wait 
times. Wolverine Wellness and 
CAPS will continue to offer 
their services virtually. Student 
Life will also offer a wide range 
of 
virtual 
extracurricular 

programs and events related to 
health and well-being.

Why did the University 

change course from the fall 
semester?

University President Mark 

Schlissel wrote that the fall 
semester saw an “unacceptable 
level of COVID-19 cases among” 
undergraduate students that 
threatened to strain public 
health 
capacity. 
The 
top 

concerns moving forward are 
the cold and flu season and 
colder weather that may move 
people to congregate indoors, 
as well as the surge of COVID-
19 cases across the state and 
country. While the stay-in-
place order reduced student 
cases in Washtenaw County, 
they remain high overall with 
a weekly test positivity rate 
of around 4%. The University 
also cited community feedback 
including continued requests 
for more testing, public health 
guidance and lessons from the 
current semester.

“It was really exciting to 
see young people not only 
stepping up and voting but 
also stepping up to make 
phone calls, send texts and 

volunteer to get out the vote.”


“I 
was 
really 
confused 

as to why we’re just now 
implementing 
asymptomatic 

testing for next semester,” 
Makar said. “I have friends at 
other schools like Ohio State, 
another big public university, 
where they get tested weekly, 
and it’s mandatory. I was 
curious 
as 
to 
know 
why 

we 
didn’t 
implement 
that 

beforehand.”

Alison Roberson, another 

LSA 
freshman 
and 
South 

Quad resident, said she was 
“shocked” by the plan for next 
semester. Roberson stated she 
returned home a month into 
the fall semester, but intended 
to come back next semester. 
Roberson 
said 
she 
was 

disappointed by the decision 
but that she felt it was the right 
decision, even though she felt 
“kind of just sad.”

“Even 
though 
we’re 
all 

disappointed, I think that it is 
the right decision.” Roberson 
said. “But I do think that they 
had to make that decision 
impulsively because of a lack 
of safety that they took in the 
first semester. First semester, 
I thought the way U of M was 
handling COVID was kind of 
bizarre because we were told 
that they were going to take 
safety precautions and they 

were not up to par with other 
universities.” 

Jennifer Rayman, class of 

1994 and a mother of a freshman 
living in a dorm this semester, 
said she felt “betrayed” and 
“blindsided” by the University. 
She also expressed concerns 
as an alum that the University 
isn’t doing enough to support 
undergraduates 
during 
the 

COVID-19 pandemic. As of 
Monday afternoon, more than 
800 
parents 
of 
University 

students 
have 
signed 
an 

open 
letter 
criticizing 
the 

University’s handling of fall 
semester and its plans for 
winter semester.

“As an alum myself I cannot 

believe these are the actions of 
the place I used to call home,” 
Rayman said. “The experience 
my child is having seems to not 
be a fraction of the one I have 
had and (the University has) 
perpetuated this situation... 
(The 
dining 
experience) 

has been despicable. Mental 
health? (The University) has 
done literally nothing for the 
isolated students.”

Soneida 
Rodriguez, 
a 

resident 
adviser 
and 
LSA 

senior, 
said 
she’s 
been 

experiencing anxiety after her 
family lost their home during 
the height of the COVID-19 
pandemic, and keeping her job 
as an RA was “high stakes” for 
her. 

Rodriguez also said she 

felt 
the 
precautions 
for 

next semester are “in the 
right direction” and should 
have 
been 
implemented 

earlier, but also maintained 
the 
importance 
of 
having 

on-campus housing options. 
She said students should have 
a “seat at the table” when 
decisions are being made.

“I think if nothing else, 

this pandemic has revealed 
the 
importance 
of 
having 

student voices heard, giving 
students a seat at the table, 
especially 
student 
staff 

members.” 
Rodriguez 
said. 

“Because at the end of the 
day, all of these decisions, 
and the lack of response 
could have been prevented if 
students had a seat at the table. 
Students could have helped 
the University respond in real 
time to the issues that we were 
seeing like a lack of testing 
and 
enforcement 
of 
social 

distancing and other safety 
measures.”

In an interview with The 

Daily Monday, University of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel said he does not 
regret 
choosing 
to 
make 

classes in-person for the fall 
semester.

“I think that we deserved as 

a community a chance to try 
our very best to have a good 
mix of remote, in-person and 
hybrid classes, and to have 
as many people as possible 
remain 
healthy 
and 
make 

it through the end of the 

semester,” 
Schlissel 
said. 

“Most people were successful 
at doing this and some groups 
were less successful at doing 
this. So I don’t regret trying. 
The world keeps changing in 
the setting of the pandemic, 
it’s novel. We’ve never been 
through 
this 
before 
as 
a 

university. Although the basic 
principles are clear about how 
to prevent transmission, we 
didn’t know until we tried to 
figure out how our community 
would respond, how much 
compliance we would get, 
where the weak points turned 
out to be.”

Overall, the announcement 

brings drastic changes for many 
students living on campus. 
Engineering freshman Ashwin 
Saxena said he now has to pack 
up his dorms in the middle of 
midterms.

“The announcement about 

the winter semester really 
throws 
off 
everything,” 

Saxena said. “I think the 
University’s decision to bring 
us back this semester was not 
well thought out and the two-
week lockdown was necessary. 
Personally, I would be sad that 
I won’t be able to come back, 
but I realize this decision is 
important for the health of the 
community.”

cities’ 

methods of police reform 
and oversight to bring back 
to Ann Arbor. Ultimately, 
efforts 
by 
community 

members culminated in the 
formation of ICPOC.

“I have no idea how many 

officers cross the line, but 
relatives and friends who are 
law enforcement officers are 
clear that they know of no 
force, including their own, 
where 100% of the officers 
walk the straight line. Their 
reputations 
are 
protected 

when the disreputable are 
held accountable. As for the 
victims of killings, brutality 
and 
disrespect, 
police 

oversight is our best hope,” 
Wilson wrote in a statement 
to The Michigan Daily in 
November of 2019. 

In a memo released two 

months after Rosser’s killing 
in January 2015, Washtenaw 
County 
Prosecutor 
Brian 

Mackie labeled the incident 
as justifiable homicide, citing 
a section of the Michigan 
Criminal Code stating that if 
a person’s belief that deadly 
force was necessary was 
genuine at the time, it does 
not matter if they were later 
proven to be wrong about 
the level of danger they were 
facing. 

Rosser’s killing prompted 

a 
series 
of 
protests 
in 

Ann Arbor. At one of the 
gatherings Rosser’s sister, 
Shae Ward, spoke about her 
sister’s death. 

“My hope is that I can get 

strong enough to speak for 
her,” Ward said at a January 
2015 
protest. 
“Because 
I 

know her person. She would 
have never attacked Officer 
Ried. She would have never 
made him feel that he would 
have to take her life to 
defuse the situation. That is 
just outlandish. It totally is 
outlandish.”

In 
the 
years 
since, 

University students and Ann 
Arbor community members 
have continued to honor 
Rosser’s 
memory, 
holding 

vigils on the anniversaries of 
her death. 

Members 
of 
the 
Black 

community in Ann Arbor 
have cited several incidents 
of over-policing and misuse 
of force before and since 

Rosser’s 
death, 
including 

increased police presence 
at multicultural fraternity 
tailgates and alleged racial 
discrimination at local bars. 
In the fall of 2017, the violent 
arrest of 16-year-old Ciaeem 
Slaton at the Blake Transit 
Center sparked a protest of 
more than 100 Ann Arbor 
residents outside of city hall 
a week later. 

Ann Arbor resident Shirley 

Beckley, who at 78-years-old 
has lived through decades of 
protest movements in Ann 
Arbor and was in attendance 
at the vigil, said the city 
hasn’t progressed as much 
as it thinks it has in terms of 
racial justice. 

“I think all of you need 

to understand Ann Arbor 

isn’t what it pretends to be,” 
Beckley said. “And we need 
everybody’s help to bring 
that forth, to make this the 
place that it ought to be — 
that they say it is.” 

Beckley said it is difficult 

to rebuild trust between 
local authorities and the 
community 
when 
Rosser 

isn’t recognized as much as 
she should be.

“You know, I don’t know 

how they think we’re gonna 
bridge 
the 
gap 
between 

the 
community 
and 
the 

police when you won’t even 
recognize 
Aura 
Rosser’s 

name,” Beckley said. “How 
are we gonna mend and 
heal when you don’t even 
recognize the woman that 
you killed, who is the mother 

of three children? How are 
we going to bridge that gap?”

After community members 

spoke and led several rounds 
of “Say her name!” “Aura 
Rosser!” chants, the crowd 
lit handheld candles and 
observed 
six 
minutes 
of 

silence: one for each year 
since Rosser’s death. 

During those six minutes, 

as the sky overhead darkened, 
Ann Arbor resident Julius 
Theophilus II said his mind 
was set on justice. 

“I was thinking of ways 

that the family and the 
people that this continuously 
happens to — what justice 
looks like to them, what 
it looks like to me, what it 
looks like to the country, 
what 
it 
looks 
like 
for 

Black people collectively,” 
Theophilus said. “And if it’s 
even possible.”

After 
the 
silence, 
the 

crowd moved swiftly through 
downtown 
Ann 
Arbor, 

marching down Main Street 
and Liberty Street. Along the 
way, several outdoor diners 
showed support with raised 
fists and cheers. 

LSA junior Rose Sproat 

said the visibility of the event 
was important for those in 
downtown Ann Arbor at the 
time. 

“It’s really important that 

we’re showing them what 

we want and that they can 
participate too,” Sproat said. 

When 
the 
marchers 

stopped at the corner of 
Liberty and State Street, 
several danced in a circle to 
accompany chants, trumpets 
and trombones. 

“Black joy is also a form of 

protest,” one person said.

Next, the crowd stopped 

in the shadow of the Burton 
Memorial Tower to hear 
a carillon piece, “Enough 
is 
Enough: 
Never 
Again 

Sketches,” played by Music, 
Theatre & Dance professor 
Tiffany 
Ng. 
The 
piece, 

coming from the bell tower, 
used a musical alphabet code 
to spell out the names of 
victims of police violence. 
Rosser’s name was played in 
measures 91 and 92, toward 
the end of the piece. 

After 
reflecting, 

Theophilus explained what 
justice looks like to him.

“The people that have 

suffered 
the 
most, 
they 

are in a position of power,” 
Theophilus 
said. 
“That’s 

what justice looks like to 
me.”

VIGIL
From Page 1

While 
several 
states 

are still counting ballots, 
political analysts have said 
it is “mathematically, nearly 
impossible” 
for 
Biden’s 

trajectory in key states to 
change. 

Harris 
thanked 

enthusiastic supporters for 
their hard work leading into 
election day. 

“Thank you for turning out 

in record numbers to make 
your voices heard,” Harris 
said. “For four years you 
marched and organized for 
equality, justice, for our lives 

and for our planet; and then 
you voted.”

Harris acknowledged her 

historic ascent as the first 
woman to be elected to the 
vice presidency.

“While I may be the first 

woman in this office, I will 
not be the last, because every 
little girl watching tonight 
sees that this is a country of 
possibilities,” Harris said.

Harris said the election 

was a decisive mandate of 
support for their campaign.

“You 
delivered 
a 
clear 

message,” Harris said. “You 
choose hope, unity, decency, 
science and yes, truth. You 
choose Joe Biden as the next 
president of the United States 

of America.”

Biden broke the record, set 

in 2008 by former President 
Barack Obama, for the most 
votes 
for 
a 
presidential 

candidate with more than 75 
million cast. 

As of Saturday, Americans 

are still waiting for final 
tallies from swing states like 
North Carolina and Georgia 
since 
Tuesday 
evening 

when polls closed across the 
country. 

President Donald Trump 

issued a statement shortly 
after the Associated Press 
called the race, refusing to 
concede, pointing to lawsuits 
his campaign has filed in 
battleground states. 

“We all know why Joe 

Biden is rushing to falsely 
pose as the winner, and why 
his media allies are trying so 
hard to help him: they don’t 
want the truth to be exposed,” 
the statement reads. “The 
simple fact is this election is 
far from over … Legal votes 
decide who is president, not 
the news media.”

The 
Trump 
campaign’s 

lawsuit before the Michigan 
Court 
of 
Claims 
was 

dismissed as it is “unlikely 
to succeed on the merits” 
and the campaign’s request 
for immediate relief were 
denied.

Despite Trump’s baseless 

claims of fraud and insistence 

that the election still has not 
been decided, the former vice 
president urged the nation to 
come together in his address 
Saturday. 

“This is the time to heal 

in 
America,” 
Biden 
said. 

“Now that the campaign is 
over — what is the people’s 
will? What is our mandate? I 
believe it is this: Americans 
have called on us to marshal 
the forces of decency and the 
forces of fairness. To marshal 
the forces of science and the 
forces of hope in the great 
battles of our time.”

In Ann Arbor, students 

shared Harris and Biden’s 
excitement about the results 
of the race.

Music, Theatre & Dance 

sophomore 
Brock 
Boze 

celebrated on State Street 
this morning and said it was 
exciting 
to 
see 
everyone 

come together in a safe way. 

“I’ve been getting about 

three hours of sleep all week 
waiting for all this to come 
in,” Boze said. “... It’s been 
a 
really 
cool 
experience, 

everyone is socially distanced 
and masked up and I am 
loving the enthusiasm.”

LSA COLLEGIATE LECTURE

From Better
Health to
Improved
Lethality:

Controlling 

Crystallization 

of Pharmaceuticals 

and Explosives

Unnikrishnan 
said 
he 

became interested in this 
work when he found out that 
President Donald Trump won 
in Michigan by about 10,000 
votes, the same number of 
people who did not vote in 
his own neighborhood of 
Ward 1 in Ann Arbor. 

“I needed to do something 

to increase voter turnout,” 
Unnikrishnan 
said. 
“We 

wanted to take on voters 
that were unlikely to vote in 
2020 and pursue them till 
the end, until they had cast 
their ballot, either absentee 
or otherwise.”

Though the organization’s 

initial goal was to achieve 
a 75% voter turnout, the 
student voter turnout in 2020 
was about 50%, as seen on a 
giant thermometer posted in 
front of the UMMA counting 
the percentage of the voting-
eligible student body that 
had voted. 

Unnikrishnan 
said 
the 

turnout 
started 
at 
about 

32% at the start of early 
voting 
and 
increased 
as 

Nov. 3 approached. He said 
he wishes the University’s 
administration offered more 
clarity on how students could 
vote.

“We put enormous pressure 

through Faculty Senate and 
even talked to the Board of 
Regents,” Unnikrishnan said. 
“President Schlissel sent an 
email to all students, and the 
email was two pages long. 

Nobody reads two-page-long 
emails. It could have just 
read: ‘Students, you just need 
your MCard, go to UMMA, 
change your registration and 
vote on the spot.’”

Nick 
Schuler, 
LSA 

sophomore and spokesperson 
for the University’s chapter 
of 
College 
Republicans, 

wrote in a statement that 
he 
was 
happy 
with 
the 

organization’s efforts to get 
out the vote.

“We saw work on both 

sides of the aisle to turn 

out the vote and I’m glad 
it worked,” Schuler said. 
“Voting is a God-given right 
in the United States and we 
should use that. Voting is 
more important than for who. 
We look forward to the 2022 
midterms and continuing our 
efforts to elect Republicans 
all across the state.” 

Andrew 
Schaeffler, 

co-founder of the student 
organization 
Students 
for 

Biden, said the group was 
excited that so many students 
used the UMMA to vote.

“We are super happy to see 

the large amount of turnout 
among 
students, 
even 
as 

some of these numbers might 
lag 
behind 
what 
turnout 

was expected,” Schaeffler 
said. “(We) hope that the 
University sees this as a 
building block for making 
voting more accessible, and 
continues to utilize this..”

Ann Arbor isn’t what it pretends to be. 
And we need everybody’s help to bring 
that forth, to make this the place that it 

ought to be — that they say it is.”


The 
Michigan 
Daily 

Administration Beat sat down with 
University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel to discuss the plan 
for the winter semester, why the 
University changed its approach 
on 
testing 
and 
enforcement 

policies, regulating Fraternity & 
Sorority Life and the impact of the 
election on campus.

This interview has been edited 

and condensed for clarity. 

TMD: In the announcement 

about winter semester plans, 
you said the University had an 
“unacceptable level” of COVID-
19 cases. In your opinion, how did 
that happen?

MS: Well, I would say the vast 

majority of students have been 
following, as strictly as they 
can, the guidance we put out 
about masks and distancing and 
small groups and hand washing. 
But when we investigate the 
cases, we find that people let 
their guard down and the cases 
are being transmitted in social 
circumstances where too many 
people 
are 
getting 
together, 

they’re not wearing their masks 
and they’re causing clusters 
of infection. And when that 
happens at a high enough rate 
of many, many new cases a day, 
it runs the risk of exceeding 
our 
capacity 
to 
do 
case 

investigations and to quickly 
isolate people who are infected 
and to track down their contacts 
to keep it from spreading even 
further. And that’s actually what 
resulted in the public health 
order that we cooperated with 
on the campus as a whole, first 
on Mary Markley Residence 
Hall, but then more broadly on 
the undergraduate students.

TMD: So do you regret 

opening 
the 
dorms 
and 

everything for the semester, 
given the “unacceptable level?”

MS: I think that we deserved, 

as a community, a chance to try 
our very best to have a good 
mix of remote, in-person and 
hybrid classes, and to have as 
many people as possible remain 
healthy and make it through 
the end of the semester. So I 
don’t regret trying. We’ve never 
been through this before as a 
university. Although the basic 
principles are clear about how to 
prevent transmission, we didn’t 
know until we tried to figure 
out how our community would 
respond, how much compliance 
we would get, where the weak 
points turned out to be. I also 
think people are suffering a 
little bit from (what) someone 
termed COVID fatigue, the sign 
of relentlessness of having to 
always have your mask on and 
always being in small groups 
and always washing your hands. 
It just wears on people, so I 
think it’s gotten tougher as the 
semester’s gone along, and all of 
those things have led, I think, to 
more cases. 

TMD: Many colleges pursued 

a strategy similar to U-M’s 2021 
winter semester in the fall, and 
many elements of the new plan 
for winter semester, like the 
right to work remotely and more 
testing, are things the Graduate 
Employees’ 
Organization 

asked for during their strike 
in September. Why didn’t you 
agree to these provisions then?

MS: Back in September, we 

started out the school year with 
80% of our classes remote, and 
the rest were either hybrid or 
in person. As the semester’s 
gone on, we’ve become more 
remote and less in person. We 
worked with the GEOs and 
basically got to the stage where 
any graduate instructor that 
didn’t feel comfortable working 
in person, we were able to 
accommodate. And the good 
news is there have been few, 
if any, infections amongst our 
graduate students. It’s largely 
undergrads, and it’s largely 

freshmen 
and 
sophomore 

undergrads, which is where 
most of the transmission has 
been. In terms of testing, we’ve 
ramped up our capacity through 
the semester. We’re at the 
highest point now we’ve been. 
In hindsight, you know, there 
are some schools that made a 
big early investment in testing. 
They’ve had some good success 
and some less good success … So 
testing is one component that’s 
important to place a lid on the 
number of cases and to prevent 
their spread.

But if you don’t wear masks, 

stay in small groups, keep 
distance from others, you can 
test all you want, and there’ll 
still be lots of disease. You know, 
back in the very beginning of the 
semester, there was an option 
to 
purchase 
large 
amounts 

of testing from commercial 
companies. But at the time, the 
turnaround time on those tests 
was between three days and 
seven days. If it takes you that 
long to get a result, the testing 
doesn’t prevent the spread of 
disease because all the people 
who have the disease didn’t find 
out about it for almost a week So 
commercial testing in the early 
days of the semester would not 
have helped us, but through 
the semester, working with a 
local startup, we’ve made the 
investments that have ramped 
up the level of testing, and we’re 
now at a capacity around 9,000 
or 10,000 tests a week. And 
by the time the new semester 
begins, we’ll be up to 12,000 to 
15,000, and if we need to, we 
can go further than that. So 
we’ve built the capacity.

TMD: Can you explain more 

about how mandatory weekly 
testing will be administered 
and enforced for those who live 
off campus but use on-campus 
facilities next semester?

This semester looks different: 

masks are required, most classes 
are virtual, social gatherings 
are limited and exploring the 
streets of Ann Arbor is regulated 
by laws and limitations. But 
for some, being a University of 
Michigan student this semester 
means sitting at their computer 
dressed in maize and blue, and 
trying to stay awake during a 
lecture while 12 hours ahead of 
Ann Arbor’s Eastern Standard 
Time.

The 
University 
allowed 

students to return to campus 
this fall with limited in-person 
classes, 
but 
for 
many 

international students, traveling 
became more difficult during the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 
and the restrictions that differ 
from country to country. 

Time zone differences put 

international students on new 
schedules 

For LSA sophomore Rachna 

Iyer, who is currently living 
in Mumbai, India, the biggest 
adjustment has been managing 
the time difference. Iyer is on 
Indian Standard Time, which 
is 10-and-a-half hours ahead of 
Ann Arbor.

“One of the biggest differences 

is having a different structure in 
my day,” Iyer said. “If someone’s 
in the same time zone, it’s easier 
to have a more normal structure 
of the day or like you wake up, 
you go to classes, you have lunch, 
you do homework and then you 
see friends. But for people living 
in a different time zone.” 

Iyer completes most of her 

school work during the late hours 
of the night in Mumbai. Students 
can complete homework and 
asynchronous classes during the 
day, but some class functions 

require synchronous activities. 

“My new thing is that I need 

to wake up before the sun sets 
here,” Iyer said. “I can at least 
pretend to maintain a little bit of 
sanity. If I wake up, and it’s dark 
outside, I would lose my mind.” 

The time differences have 

been an issue across the board 
for international students at 
the University, according to 
International Center Director 
Judith Pennywell. 

Pennywell said the use of 

asynchronous class, a strategy 
that allows instructors to publish 
work and students to complete it 
at their own pace throughout the 
day, has allowed students more 
flexibility than if they had every 
class at a scheduled time. 

“While many instructors have 

changed from a synchronous 
to 
asynchronous 
style 
or 

rescheduled 
their 
classes 

to 
times 
of 
day 
to 
better 

accommodate 
international 

students, 
others 
have 
not,” 

Pennywell said. “It requires 
some international students to 
be available for synchronous 
classes very early in the morning 
or late at night, at times when 
they might normally be asleep.” 

Though 
asynchronous 

classes allow more leeway in 
mitigating 
time 
differences, 

international 
students 
said 

there are still other problems 
that going asynchronous doesn’t 
automatically fix. 

Engineering junior Jingxuan 

Wu is learning from China, 12 
hours ahead of EST. Wu said the 
issue can extend beyond class 
time into things like scheduled 
exam times. Wu has taken 
midterms that started anywhere 
from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.

“For the exam time, there’s no 

time alternatives, so you can’t 
change anything, you just need 

to go,” Wu said. “Midterms are 
usually scheduled during class 
times, or after class. What seems 
like an ideal time for a midterm 
for Ann Arbor students, is quite 
different 
for 
international 

students.”

LSA freshman Shiryn Anissa 

Noor Affendi said taking a 
class 
asynchronously 
as 
an 

international student can also 
create barriers in trying to get 
help. Affendi said she often has 
to rely on email to communicate 
with her instructors.

“My 
asynchronous 
classes 

are definitely more challenging 
just because I’m mostly teaching 
myself the material,” Affendi 
said. “I can only get help via 
email, so each problem I face 
really boils down to, ‘Can I 
answer this myself, or am I 
willing to wait two business days 
for them to reply?’” 

LSA 
senior 
Jing 
Dong, 

who is taking classes from 
China, said Graduate Student 
Instructors will typically have 
delayed responses to questions 
because her usual work time 
is the middle of the night in 
Ann Arbor. However, despite 
this inconvenience, Dong said 
there aren’t many other notable 
differences in learning this year.

“Because 
I’m 
a 
computer 

science major, personally, I don’t 
think taking classes online would 
be any different from taking 
classes offline because even if 
I’m in person, I would probably 
watch lecture recordings, but I 
guess that’s pretty specific to my 
major,” Dong said.

Taking classes at night allows 

international students to use 
their time during the day to 
prioritize what’s important to 

them, according to Dong. She 
said having the new schedule 
has allowed her to take on 
new roles such as a research 
assistantship because of the 
flexibility. Affendi uses the time 
she has during her day to spend 
time with family and friends.

Being off-campus changes 

learning, social experience

In 
addition 
to 
the 
time 

difference, 
there 
are 
a 

variety of global, social and 
environmental 
elements 
that 

have altered students’ learning 
environments. For Iyer, one is 
the heat in India that makes it 
hard to focus.

“Giving a timed exam is 

harder, virtually you just don’t 
really know what circumstances 
someone’s in,” Iyer said. “It’s 
really hot in India, for example, 
and to be giving an exam at this 
time, it’s just really hot, which 
makes it harder to focus.”

Academics is only part of the 

experience of being a college 
student — and international 
students said they missed the 
experience of being in Ann Arbor. 
Besides not being on campus, the 
virtual events hosted by clubs 
and organizations often don’t 
accommodate 
international 

students’ time zone differences.

 Wu said it is particularly 

difficult to work with libraries 
and shared spaces.

“The 
main 
thing 
I 
miss 

about campus is libraries and 
in-person office hours,” Wu said. 
“I think it’s more convenient 
and it’s also harder to connect 
with classmates and friends 
when you’re abroad in another 
country.” 

Outside of school, Affendi, 

who lives in Malaysia and is 13 
hours ahead of Ann Arbor, said 
it has become nearly impossible 
to make friends. She feels like 
she would have to sacrifice 
getting sleep to be able to attend 
extracurricular meetings. 

 “I’ve always loved school for 

the friends I gain in and outside 
of class,” Affendi said. “It’s hard 
to approach a stranger when 
everyone is virtually in their 
own bubble. I really miss the 
support system of friends in my 
classes and lately it just feels like 
it’s every man for themselves, 
which makes me feel really 
lonely.” 

Iyer hasn’t been able to see 

any of her friends in person since 
classes ended last March.

Dong said she has not been 

able to participate in many 
sorority events because they are 

not virtual. She said she feels 
especially sad for freshmen, who 
have never had time on campus 
to make connections.

“If you’re not on campus, 

social life is hard,” Dong said. “I 
would imagine there’s a big hole 
in the experience for freshmen, 
and I feel sorry for them.”

The University has put on 

many virtual events and lecture 
discussions in order to create 
community, but international 
students 
are 
still 
finding 

these difficult to participate 
in, Iyer said. Pennywell said 
the 
International 
Center 
is 

working to create a virtual 
community that accommodates 
international students and their 
time zone differences.

“We have made an effort 

to record certain University 
programs, such as the IC and 
Ginsberg 
Center’s 
Understanding 

the U.S. Presidential Election,” 
Pennywell 
said. 
“There 
are 

many wonderful UMS Digital 
presentations, 
so 
students 

overseas can enjoy them at their 
leisure.”

In early February, I found myself in a high 

school gym in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, watching 
an energetic Elizabeth Warren bop around the 
stage in her textbook blue cardigan and black 
pants. She spoke of her days as a teacher, her 
husband Bruce and her dog Bailey, as well as her 
plans for the country. 

The crowd, made up of mostly women and 

young girls, sat tightly packed together, every 
eye focused on the Senator. I was in Iowa for 48 
hours weeks before the Democratic caucuses 
— and before the pandemic began. At the time, 
the crowd’s worry was focused on the caucus 
less than two days away, not their job security, 
healthcare, 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
or 
social 

distancing guidelines. 

We went to three campaign rallies that 

weekend — Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders 
and Joe Biden — and stopped at a myriad of other 
events. I drove back to Michigan hopeful, after 
watching Warren kneel down to pinky promise 
a little girl, talking with a family who brought 
their newborn to see Bernie speak and listening 
to John Kerry stump for Biden. Iowans are 
proud of their place in politics — being “first in 
the nation” isn’t something they take lightly. I 
left the weekend exhausted, but I also remember 
feeling confident that our democracy was alive 
and well. 

Allison Engkvist - Managing Photo Editor 
Flash forward a month from the Iowa caucus: 

Senator Warren has dropped from the race and 
Senator Bernie Sanders takes a trip to Ann Arbor. 

It’s the week of the Democratic presidential 

primary election, or informally known as the 
week our world went straight to hell. Students 
begin to express concern over a pending 
pandemic, but life still feels normal.

We gather on the Diag, cheering for Bernie, 

not a mask in site. We wait in line outside of our 
polling location without standing six-feet apart. 
We sit around the TV with friends waiting for 
the primary results, exceeding the ten person 
limit. We go to class. We hug our friends. Then 
suddenly, we’re packing our bags and heading 
home.

Well, we all know how the rest of the story 

goes. 

But here we are, back on campus for one of 

the most important elections of our lives thus 
far. Everything looks different this year. It’s the 
distanced lines. 

The face masks. The posters, begging people 

to vote. The hope.

While everything may look different, the 

meaning of election day holds true: using our 
voice to help guide our country’s future. 

This is Election Day 2020 through the eyes 

(and lenses) of the Michigan Daily photo staff. 

Maddie Fox - Staff Photographer
2020 is truly an unreal reality. The world has 

never felt more uncertain, eerie and bleak. We 

have faced a series of unexpected events this fall, 
adding to the chaotic election season. Supreme 
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Sept. 
18, allowing President Trump to both nominate 
and confirm three Justices over the course of his 
term, a legacy that will outlast his presidency for 
decades to come. 

On Oct. 2 the president, his wife, his son, 

his press secretary, his campaign manager, the 
chair of the Republican National Committee, 
White House housekeeping and military staff, 
members of the vice president’s staff, Stephen 
Miller, Kellyanne Conway, and Hope Hicks all 
contracted coronavirus. Even though COVID-
19 cases are at an all-time high and on the rise, 
CDC guidelines for socially distanced crowds 
and mask-wearing are not being followed. 

The chaos on the season further ensued 

locally on Oct. 7 when a domestic terrorist group 

plotted to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. 

Perhaps the eeriest feeling of all was watching 

the Oct. 15 presidential debate that was originally 
planned to take place here, right on campus. 
Uncertainty has triumphed. 

As we barrel into an election that is 

preemptively contested based on false claims of 
voter fraud, the United States could find itself in 
the midst of a national meltdown, regardless of 
the candidate you support. Our democracy as we 
know could slip into utter chaos, or perhaps not 
and everything will be fine. That is the reality 
of 2020. 

Emma Mati - Assistant Photo Editor
On Tuesday, Oct. 27, on assignment for The 

Daily, I attended one of President Donald 

Trump’s final campaign events in Lansing, 
Mich. My expectations for the rally were largely 
formulated by late-night shows mocking events 
like this one and clips of the President’s most 
notable — and most outrageous — moments that 
appeared on my social media feed. In the final 
few days of the campaign, I wanted to see a 
Trump rally for myself. 

The rally, unique in its own right, was much 

like a concert of a musician mostly adored by my 
parents’ generation. Devoted fans waiting in a 
seemingly never-ending line for hours just to see 
their idol from afar. Unattractive merchandise 
being sold outside the venue, indicating that 
you were there. When I arrived at the rally at 
6:30 a.m., Trump supporters had been camping 
outside the venue for hours. It was cold and 
raining. You could find just about any piece of 
MAGA merchandise available.

I realized that Make America Great Again is 

not just a rally cry, but a manipulating marketing 
technique as well. Shirts that read “Jesus is my 
savior, Trump is my president” and “Talking 
to you reminds me to clean my gun” seemed to 
reflect Christian evangelicalism and free speech 
that had been made “great again” by Donald 
Trump.

Inside the rally, few in the crowd were 

wearing masks, although it is important to note 
that volunteers were taking temperatures and 

trying — albeit unsuccessfully — to get people to 
wear masks. Nevertheless, some may think that 
the photographs I took at the rally were taken 
a year ago given the large crowds, lack of social 
distancing and minimal mask wearing. 

A prayer kicked off a series of speakers 

intended to hype up the crowd. Celine Dion’s 
greatest hits, a selection of Broadway classics 
and CeeLo Green’s “Crazy” seemed to keep the 
crowd in good spirits. Trump danced to the 
Village People’s hit “YMCA” which I thought 
was an exaggeration made by the members of 
Saturday Night Live on a recent Weekend Update 
bit. They were not joking. 

Not a naturally gifted orator compared to his 

predecessor, it was clear when Trump would 
abandon the teleprompter to rally the crowd. 
He dropped an F-bomb. At one point, Trump 
berated his son-in-law Jared Kushner, calling 
him “Mr. Inside” because he didn’t want to 
stand in the freezing cold rain listening to his 
father-in-law’s speech. It seemed that Trump 
supporters didn’t come to the rally to hear his 
plans to end the COVID-19 pandemic or revive 
our nation’s economy, but rather to see a show, 
the Trump show.

But politics aside, Trump’s rallies are going to 

go down in history. Trump is a populist president 
and the way in which he rallies his supporters 
is indicative of that. And whether Trump wins 
or loses the election, it is important to keep in 
mind that his supporters aren’t going anywhere. 
I saw many families with young children 
donning MAGA hats and plenty of people my age 

expressing their support for Trump’s message in 
other ways. 

They are Americans, just like us. I don’t think 

that the majority of the people at the rally are 
bad people. Yes, they may have adopted some 
negative beliefs propagated by social media and 
the Trump presidency, but they are humans. 
Things aren’t going to change overnight.

Becca Mahon - Assistant Photo Editor
Attending rallies for both Joe Biden and 

Donald Trump within a 24 hour period made the 
differences in the two candidates plainly clear. 

To me, the starkest contrast was in the 

interactions between the candidates and their 
respective supporters. Biden’s Detroit event was 
attended by a couple hundred people, who were 
encouraged to stay in their cars and honk in lieu 
of applause. The next day at a rally in Macomb, 
Trump spoke to a crowd of a few thousand people 
packed tightly around the stage. 

When he pointed out the media area behind 

them, referencing what he called the “fake 
news”, the crowd turned and chanted “CNN 
lies!” at the press, while Trump watched silently 
from the stage. Being on the receiving end of this 
was unsettling to say the least. 

Visually, this year’s election day certainly 

looks different. However, the importance of 
voting and being present during trying times 
is something that drove this election and will 
continue to drive every election to come.

Critical learning requires a 

degree of vulnerability from 
the learner and the teacher. But 
when the traumas of systemic 
oppression are unaddressed 
in the classroom, marginal-
ized students aren’t given the 
chance they deserve to show 
their own vulnerability, and 
thus aren’t given the chance to 
engage in a wholly authentic 
and meaningful learning expe-
rience.

First, let’s make no mistake: 

Being vulnerable means being 
courageous. We often underes-
timate how courage translates 
in a classroom setting. Criti-
cally engaging with material 
requires putting ourselves in 
a state in which we’re open 
to potential failure. This is 
especially true in the arts and 
humanities which ask us to 
draw from our own lived human 
experience during the learn-
ing process. Although drasti-
cally understated, the daunting 
challenge of arts courses is 
being emotionally vulnerable. 
For students impacted by trau-
ma, this vulnerability can be a 
difficult commitment to make, 
for any class. 

Educators should strive to 

cultivate a learning environ-
ment in which students tap 
into their own vulnerability in 
order to succeed. 

This means removing the 

punishment from education 
which manifests itself in the 
formal and hidden curriculum. 
Western 
Philosopher 
Louis 

Althusser in his piece Ideology 
and Ideological State Appara-
tuses first describes the ways 
in which the punitive or repres-
sive nature of educational insti-
tutions serves as a means to 
reproduce class inequality. He 
asserts that this repression and 
punishment shows up in both 
the “formal curriculum” which 
refers to the official courses, 
lessons and academic learn-
ing taught to the student — as 
well as in what educators call 
the “hidden curriculum” which 
refers to the transference of 
conventions, norms and beliefs 
in the classroom.

The 
formal 
curriculum’s 

punitive 
nature 
manifests 

itself in American schools by 
its design; strict yet often arbi-
trary and superficial grading 
systems cause students to focus 
on the completion of assign-
ments rather than engagement 
in material. Mechanical memo-
rization and rhythmic repeti-
tion establish an environment 
in which students are afraid 
to take risks and become what 
Paulo Freire describes in Peda-
gogy of Freedom as “slaves to 
the text.” In this current aca-
demic 
environment, 
largely 

attributable to what Freire 
refers to as the banking model 
of education, critical capacity, 
the curiosity of the learner and 
the autonomy of the learner 
are essentially non-existent. 
Students learn under coercion 
rather than out of a pure inter-
est for knowledge about the 
wondrous world we live in. 
When the threat of a poor grade 
takes precedence over learn-
ing, the likelihood of cheating, 
dis-engagement, dropping out 
and other adverse behaviors in 
the classroom increases. 

The 
hidden 
curriculum’s 

punitive nature, on the other 
hand, manifests itself more 
subtly, yet still is just as dis-
paraging. Colonized classroom 
management punishes students 
for tardiness and absenteeism 
(which fails to apply a holis-
tic approach to the underly-
ing reasons as to why students 
might be late or have to miss 
class) and punishes students 

for not following rules in class 
or misbehaving (rather than 
re-directing 
or 
seeking 
to 

understand the root cause of 
a student’s insubordination). 
Discipline disparities for Black 
students as well as students 
with disabilities persist before 
pre-K, and overall, Latinx, 
Black and Native/Indingenous 
students are given disciplin-
ary punishment at dispropor-
tionate rates, contributing to 
the ongoing school-to-prison 
pipeline nexus that plagues our 
communities to this day. 

Additionally, 
Althusser’s 

notion of education serving as a 
reproduction of class inequali-
ty allows us to see how students 
of higher socio-economic sta-
tus are able to be more vulner-
able and take more risks in the 
classroom. With access to tech-
nology, tutoring, academic sup-
port, prep-courses and highly 
educated parents students at 
their disposal, wealthier stu-
dents are put at a significant 
advantage before even stepping 
foot in the classroom. 

Couple 
this 
with 
the 

immense amount of opportu-
nities that students of higher 
income are able to take advan-
tage of. High school clubs such 
as Speech and Debate and 
Model United Nations, sum-
mer camps, private dance and 
vocal lessons, club sports and 
many other prominent, enrich-
ing opportunities all require 
money, time, access to trans-
portation and resources. Many 
of us take for granted how 
these activities cultivate our 
intellect, and thus, allow us to 
achieve at high levels. All these 
activities require a degree of 
courage (and vulnerability) in 
order to participate which aids 
us in the long run. 

Outside of systemic barri-

ers, 
marginalized 
students 

are grossly underrepresented 
in the classroom, which con-
tributes to their inability to 
be emotionally vulnerable in 
learning spaces. An under-
whelming 2% of educators are 
black males, whereas nearly 
80% of the teaching workforce 
is comprised of white Christian 
women. 

Without 
representation, 

without an educator who can 
authentically understand your 
identity, and your struggle, and 
your oppression, the critical 
learning process cannot fully 
take place for anyone.

As an aspiring educator of 

color, gaining current expe-
rience in Crescendo Detroit, 
where I teach acting, establish-
ing a pedagogy that empowers 
students to engage at a critical 
level in which they are able 
to be vulnerable is key. This 
entails preparing a curriculum 
that favors the autonomy of my 
student, cultivates their inner 
curiosity and draws on their 
own lived experience in an 
uplifting manner. 

Having a trauma-informed, 

intentional 
approach 
about 

who is being represented in 
the material, what themes 
and ideas the material dis-
cusses and how the material is 
accessed (especially in this vir-
tual setting), are all necessary 
efforts in education.

While there’s a lot educators 

can do to allow students to be 
more vulnerable in classes, we 
as students should keep in mind 
the critical role we play in aid-
ing our own learning. Learning 
is a lifelong, dynamic process. 
As the Leaders and Best, for-
tunate enough to receive a top-
notch quality education at the 
No. 1 ranking public school in 
the nation, we should always 
strive to make the most of our 
academic journey, with the 
hopes that one day, a critical 
learning experience will be 
available to all.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

15 Alone, at a party
17 Christian sch. in 

32 The Red Baron, 

The murders of George Floyd, 

Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Tay-
lor and numerous other inno-
cent Black people this year 
sparked a revolution yearning 
for change Black people have 
needed for many years. With 
worldwide daily protests and 
heavy social media conversa-
tions about race, it feels like the 
world is finally waking up to 
the injustices Black people have 
faced for centuries in America. 
But how much reform can there 
really be in systemic racism if 
the systems that encourage this 
oppression fail to change? Indi-
viduals are constantly being told 
to fix the racial biases present in 
this country when most of the 
blame should be shifted towards 
corporate performative activ-
ism. It is easy for brands to say 
that they want to see change 
and are in solidarity with those 
who are suffering from the sys-
temic challenges of this country. 
It is easy to post an Instagram 
picture condemning racism to 
make themselves look good. 
But if there is no real change or 
accountability being taken for 
their contributions to the sys-
temic challenges marginalized 
communities face, the preached 
activism is useless. The reality 
of this corporate performative 
activism has resulted in the con-
tinued oppression of marginal-
ized groups of people. It’s great 
that brands like Aunt Jemima 
and 
Uncle 
Ben 
recognized 

the racist foundation of their 
brands, but the surface level 
activism only further establish-
es the very institutions we are 
trying to get rid of. Were all the 
promises from brands and cor-
porations to do better genuine? 
Or were they just stunts used to 

keep consumers coming? 

Following the protests and 

pledges from brands to do bet-
ter for the Black community, 
Sharon 
Chuter, 
Founder 
of 

Uoma Beauty decided to ques-
tion these claims. She launched 
an Instagram campaign called 
#pulluporshutup 
where 
she 

challenged these pledges of 
solidarity by asking companies 
to release the number of Black 
people they have in positions 
higher than field and retail lev-
els. With there being an average 
of 10% of Black college gradu-
ates in America, Chuter wanted 
to see how many brands have at 
least 10% of Black representa-
tion in those higher positions. 

As I followed this campaign, 

I have been shocked to see just 
how many brands that I support 
still have little to no Black voic-
es in leadership positions. Even 
some of my favorites who have 
voiced their support for diversi-
ty, including Netflix, Apple and 
Nike, all surprised me in how 
little Black representation they 
have. Netflix has only 7% Black 
representation across the orga-
nization, 8% in leadership roles 
and none in executive positions. 
Apple has only 3% of Black voic-
es in leadership roles, and 9% 
Black representation through-
out the company. Nike has no 
Black representation in execu-
tive positions, and only 4.8% in 
corporate levels. These brands 
thrive on Black dollars, but can’t 
hire these same people to lead 
their companies?

Some 
brands 
pledged 
to 

increase their Black representa-
tion and donate to HBCUs and 
foundations fighting for Black 
lives after being called out. Uni-
lever, which is home to business-
es including Dove, Vaseline and 
Lipton, committed to making 
their workforce more diverse 
with only 8% of Black repre-

sentation across the corpora-
tion and 17% in leadership roles. 
They are also donating over $1 
million dollars to bail funds 
and organizations fighting for 
Black lives. Coty Inc, which is 
home to beauty brands includ-
ing Covergirl, Sally Hansen, 
and Rimmel London, has 17.2% 
of black representation across 
the board and 2.9% at executive 
levels. Covergirl has commit-
ted to amplifying Black beauty 
influencers on their platform 
and donating money to Black 
Lives Matter and the NAACP 
Legal Defense Fund. There are 
even some companies that have 
been successful in implement-
ing more than that bench mark 
of 10% in their leadership posi-
tions. ELF cosmetics’ leader-
ship team is 14% Black and 45% 
diverse. P & G, which is home to 
Old Spice and Pantene, has 13% 
Black representation in leader-
ship positions and plans to do 
more. Progress has been made 
with businesses seemingly tak-
ing accountability for the part 
they play in systemic racism, but 
is this just more corporate per-
formative activism? 

In a survey of 2378 people 

conducted under Chuter’s same 
campaign, 70% have not seen 
any of these changes happen-
ing in their company, and 69% 
have seen their companies lose 
momentum since June when 
they said they would make these 
changes. Statements commit-
ting to change look good on 
paper, but it is interesting to see 
just how many companies have 
no intentions of improving their 
faults. 

In July, actress Aisha Dee 

released a statement calling out 
her show The Bold Type for its 
part in the lack of Black repre-
sentation in Corporate Ameri-
ca. The Bold Type is one of my 
favorite shows to watch because 

they have difficult conversa-
tions about race, sexuality and 
gender. But what is communi-
cated on screen is not always 
carried out behind the scenes. 
Dee revealed that it took two out 
of the show’s four seasons to get 
a writer of color. In forty-eight 
episodes, only two of them were 
directed by a Black woman, and 
it took three seasons for some-
one who knew how to do tex-
tured hair to appear in dressing 
rooms. The presidents of Uni-
versal TV and Freeform, where 
the show is housed, have Black 
women presidents, but there is 
still little representation in the 
production crew that creates 
this show. If the need for social 
change is embraced on screen, 
why isn’t it practiced behind 
the scenes? If what is preached 
on camera isn’t translated in the 
real world, the activism is per-
formative and hypocritical of 
the messages they try to teach 
viewers at home. It further con-
tributes to the oppression of 
marginalized groups. 

I am happy to see how many 

people seem to be in solidar-
ity with Black voices that have 
been silenced for so long. I have 
also been eager to be intro-
duced to and support so many 
Black owned brands through 
the Instagram account @black-
ownedeverything. But the pres-
ence of corporate performative 
activism does more harm than 
it does good if corporations are 
unable to acknowledge their 
own faults. Marginalized com-
munities have suffered for too 
long. Plans for change are no 
longer suggested, but rather 
demanded and expected. If 
2020 has taught us one thing, 
it is that life is unpredictable — 
it is okay and also necessary to 
change the principles compa-
nies were founded on. We need

Noor Al-Fikhri was buried in a 

shallow grave under a fig tree ten 
minutes before noon, after her left 
ankle gave out in an attempt to 
hang her blue silk dress to dry while 
climbing the rusty, half-removed 
ladder that led to the roof. My 12 
year old grandmother found her 
sister half-splayed, cats and flies 
lapping at what little remained of 
the dried blood, her knees disjoint-
ed and contorted in the special sort 
of way that could only be found 
on a dead woman. The women in 
their building wailed and cried 
for three nights and three days, 
her body on their kitchen floor as 
they partook in the Islamic ritual 
of ghusul every Muslim body 
must go through after death. My 
grandmother said their grief was 
so heavy and viscous that it crept 
across every hallway and corridor, 
trapping, toes and the balls of feet, 
so that even climbing one flight of 
stairs became the most arduous 
task. Noor was buried in an expert 
fashion, a ritual the three men of 
the graveyard had perfected over 
the years and years they had held 
the job, plowing into the thick and 
hardened dirt, angling the shovel 
up, and down, and everywhere in 
between. My grandmother tells me 
that the earth would not accept her 
that day, that the men got down on 

their hands and knees and scraped 
and clawed at the ground with 
their own hands, dousing it with 
water, and forcing the land to open 
its bowels with pieces of rusted 
metal, in a furious and haphazard 
fashion, for there were five more 
women and men and children 
expected to be buried that day and 
they were expected at the mosque 
soon afterwards for late afternoon 
prayers. 

Noor’s death became the sort 

of story only told as a cautionary 
tale to misbehaving boys, a sad 
anecdote so frequently told over a 
meal, that the mere mention of her 
name caused the tea to sour and 
the fruit to bloat. My grandmother 
tells me the landlord ordered the 
most expensive and sophisticated 
of cleaning supplies from France, 
squatting down on all fours in a 
pressed suit and the finest of leath-
er shoes from Istanbul, to scrape 
and scour the splatter of blood that 
remained as the final indicator of 
Noor’s existence. The inhabitants 
of the building gathered around 
him in a big, unmoving mass, the 
men yelling that he must scrape 
the ground harder and the women 
reminding him that he had missed 
a spot. Over the years my grand-
mother among many tried her 
hand at lifting the stain from the 
tile. Scrubbing and scraping, dab-
bing and praying and smoothing, 
and yet the stain never ceased to 
exist.

Michigan in Color

The question hit me a few weeks 

ago: When my parents die, will I 
choose to wear black or white to 
their funerals? Or rather, would 
they have wanted me to wear 
black or white? Because the color 
can symbolize death, it’s tradi-
tional for Koreans to wear white to 
funerals, but until last month I had 
only ever thought of this as a novel 
fun fact that existed solely outside 
of myself. 

I’d never connected this custom 

to my own heritage because I felt 
so deeply entrenched in Ameri-
can life. For context, I was born 
and raised in the Midwest, but 
my parents moved back to Korea 
my freshman year of college. Sub-
sequently, I lived with them in 
Busan for nearly half a year this 
past summer, forcing me to face 
an unfortunate reality: The rest of 
my parents’ lives would be spent 
across the world in a country that 
would never feel like home to me. 
Like most people, I don’t like to 
think about dying, or death or 
mortality, but this black or white 
question forces me to realize that, 
no matter how I feel, I need to edu-
cate myself on these real customs 
because they’re an inescapable 
part of me and my family.

I’d pondered the afterlife and 

the brevity of our existences many 
times, just like any other boring, 
responsible adult would, but I had 
never thought much about death in 
the context of my own culture. My 
experiences with broader Korean 
attitudes toward dying include a 
small handful of rites which I had 
to be gently coached through as an 
ignorant child.

I thought about death for the 

first time in the summer of 2008. I 
was seven years old and I remem-
ber taking a long car ride with my 
family to a mountain that had been 
carved into terraces. On every 
level was row after row of evenly 
spaced mounds of earth coated 
in a layer of grass, and I asked my 
mom what they were. She told me 
they were dead bodies. We walked 
around the cemetery trying to 
locate my grandpa, or as we know 
him, halabeoji. I was more fasci-
nated than horrified by the hun-
dreds of mounds surrounding us 

because, at that age, death didn’t 
even seem like a genuine possibil-
ity to me.

I caught onto the somber mood 

of the occasion and tried to be as 
quiet and still as possible (but, 
knowing me, I was probably nei-
ther quiet nor still), and when we 
got to his mound, my family pre-
pared a makeshift shrine of sorts. 
They poured soju on his mound so 
he wouldn’t thirst, set his favor-
ite foods in front of him so he 
could eat and even bought him a 
packet of cigarettes because he 
smoked in life. We stood in silence 
for a moment, and I felt the first 
vague, heavy sense that this man 
I never knew had been a real per-
son just like me -- after all, he ate 
my favorite snacks, Peperos and 
sweet breads. I can usually ask 
my mom for any food I’m craving 
and she obliges, despite voicing 
some choice remarks about my 
health and weight gain — maybe 
it’s because I’m the maknae, or the 
youngest child, but she can never 
seem to tell me no. That day, how-
ever, I remember her gently saying 
that none of this was for me. Soon 
after that, we left.

None of this had been explained 

to me beforehand, but what I had 
participated in that day was called 
a jaesa, a ceremony traditionally 
held on every anniversary of a 
loved one’s death. We remember 
and honor them, and we bring 
them sustenance to eat and drink 
and enjoy in the spirit world.

The next time I participated in a 

jaesa, I was 15 walking through that 
same winding terrace; I remem-
ber feeling sick, unable to look up 
from the flat ground beneath my 
feet, terrified that my hand might 
graze one of the mounds by acci-
dent. Nothing makes me feel more 
mortal than walking through a 
Korean cemetery. Coming from 
a country where graveyards are 
intricately plotted fields strewn 
with commemorative headstones 
of varying shapes and materials, 
or even statues and monuments 
for the wealthier deceased, these 
identical mounds were impersonal 
to me. They made me feel as if, no 
matter how I lived my life, I was 
no different than anybody else, 
and that thought disquiets me. I 
say this after much reflection and 
a deeper analysis of these photos 
and my memory, but during the 

jaesa, all I wanted to do was get the 
hell out of there. 

In our history, death is followed 

by funeral rites which were born 
out of the fear that our souls might 
be lost and unable to pass peace-
fully into the afterlife. It’s difficult 
for me to read about these customs 
without the curious intrigue of a 
complete outsider. I read texts as 
“their way of life” and “their cus-
toms,” and I detach myself from 
the narrative, detangle myself from 
any real responsibility. I read that 
the main duties fall to children of 
the deceased, and I don’t connect 
that this will be me and my sister 
someday down the line, trying to 
mourn and guide our parents’ spir-
its to the afterlife. Korean funeral 
customs reflect our rich history 
and our belief in the value of fam-
ily. Pineun mulboda jinhada. Blood 
is thicker than water.My halabeoji 
was a quiet man who didn’t like 
jokes: I don’t know how he man-
aged to get along with my dad, 
who was always the rowdy class 
clown. I don’t know if halabeoji 
would have gotten along with me, 
who inherited so much of my dad’s 
happy irreverence. My mom is a lot 
like halabeoji: They both loved to 
read, a trait which was then passed 
down to me; they had strong work 
ethics, but could never understand 
those who didn’t. They were seri-
ous about their education, had no 
tolerance for people who didn’t 
use every minute of their days pro-
ductively and had no qualms about 
telling them so. They were both 
artists. 

Maybe mom was halabeoji’s 

favorite because they were so simi-
lar, or maybe they were so similar 
because she was halabeoji’s favor-
ite. But either way, he spoke to her 
more than his other children, two 
boys and two more girls, during 
a time when sons were the typi-
cal favorites (as they were to my 
halmeoni), and he talked to my 
mom with dignity and respect. 

Halabeoji wore many hats: He 

was a police detective who solved 
murders, an aspiring judge who 
failed the bar, a high school teacher 
whose students, not knowing the 
relation, complained about him 
to their friend, my mom. He was 
bright, he went to college at a time 
when it wasn’t the norm to do so, 
especially in impoverished Korea. 
He was a prolific writer and an art-

ist whose wife, my halmeoni, never 
one for sentiment, threw away his 
work after he died without telling 
my mom. Halabeoji was politically 
conservative which formed a rift 
between him and my mother, a 
rift she would later regret. He was 
highly knowledgeable about the 
world. He visited America once 
when I was two, my sister six, and 
he asked her if she knew where the 
Mississippi River was, which ter-
rified her. He refused to call the 
Japanese anything but “those bas-
tards,” and he had a lifelong hatred 
of communists for murdering his 
family, seizing his land and leaving 
him in squalor when he was young. 
The one time he got to meet me in 
2003, he told my mom I looked 
just like she did when she was two 
years old. 

My halabeoji passed away in 

July of 2003, weeks before his 
wife’s birthday. He died without 
warning. There was no diagnosis 
which would allow him to make 
amends or say his goodbyes. One 
day, he went out for a jog and then 
he fell and then he was brain dead. 
My mom was the fourth of five 
children, and her siblings had to 
argue over whether or not to turn 
off the machines which kept his 
body alive. Her oppa said, “He’s 
never going to wake up anyway,” 
and her unnies asked him, “How 
can you do this to our own father?”

She was in America when this 

happened. I was two years old, 
and it was almost the third anni-
versary of their move to a coun-
try she didn’t want to be in. Aunt 
Gyeonghwa was the one who 

called her and broke the news. My 
mom didn’t know airlines made 
exceptions for the bereaved, so she 
stayed behind in America, mourn-
ing alone while across the world, 
traditions were upheld and even-
tually everyone was able to col-
lect themselves, without her. She 
sewed pillowcases and sofa cover-
ings alone to cope with her grief.

I’ve never had a real connection 

with halabeoji, so I’m unsure why, 
in the past year, I’ve thought about 
him so often — almost obsessively 
— and tried to imagine what loss 
was like for my mom. I’ve tried to 
picture her feeling compelled to do 
this one simple task in the midst 
of her grief, driving to Joanne’s, 
purchasing yards of burnt orange 
fabric, and upholstering a couch. 
But I can’t, or maybe it’s just too 
difficult for me.

The truth is that I see a lot of 

myself in Mom now that my par-
ents live in Korea and I live in 
Michigan.

We are living in a global pan-

demic. Traveling is not easy. If 
my mom goes out for a jog and 
then she falls and then she is brain 
dead, will I be able to lie next to 
her in bed, to hold her one last time 
before we turn off the machines? 
Or will I remain in America, will 
I have to buy a skein of yarn and 
learn to knit a blanket instead?

Halabeoji was, to me, nothing 

more than my dead grandpa for 
so long. I didn’t think about him. 
I never used to ask my mom any 
questions about her appa. Maybe 
I care about him now because, if 
my mom were to pass away unex-

pectedly soon, I would want my 
child to care about her halmeoni in 
a way that I never cared for hala-
beoji when I was a girl.

I text my mom for her recipes; 

I get her opinion on the clothes 
I shop for or the makeup looks I 
apply; I want her advice on every 
decision; I suddenly need to know 
what that job was that my halabeo-
ji had wanted but he never passed 
the test for; I ask her where she 
was during the Gwangju Uprising 
and what she thought when she 
saw me for the very first time. I 
will continue to have those ques-
tions even after she’s gone, but 
then I will receive no answers. 
Asking myself what color to wear 
at her funeral is just one of those 
questions I need to ask her soon or 
I’ll never know.

Last week I finally asked her 

the question, carefully framing 
the situation as hypothetical even 
though we both understood it to 
be a very real decision I will some-
day have to make. She told me I 
should wear whatever I want to 
wear because she doesn’t think it 
matters, and told me not to worry 
because my family will be around 
for a long time. Later, when she 
hung up, she told me how much she 
loved me, that she was so proud of 
me. I realized then that even after 
she is gone and new questions 
arise, these are the answers which 
will sustain me through every 
moment of private mourning and 
solitude. I know I won’t receive 
all the answers I want, but that’s 
okay. The most important ones 
will always stay with me.

7-Opinion

E

ver since Donald Trump was 
inaugurated back in 2017, 
much of American politics 

has revolved around a fundamental 
question of political science: What 
exactly 
defines 
authoritarianism, 

and does Donald Trump fit within 
that mold? Though it’s obvious that 
Trump 
harbors 
anti-democratic 

ambitions, a defining feature of his 
presidency is that although he might 
want to be an authoritarian, he’s bad 
at actually achieving his ideological 
and political goals. Looking back on 
the past four years, it is obvious that 
the person who has done the most 
to stymie Trump’s authoritarian 
instincts, via a combination of political 
ineptitude and sheer laziness, is 
Trump himself. While effective 
anti-democratic leaders work to 
consolidate and expand their political 
control through economic populism, 
disciplined attacks on democratic 
policies and opportunistic power 
grabs, Trump has repeatedly failed to 
do this, rendering him a phony, failed 
authoritarian. 

Before evaluating what he’s done 

(or failed to do) as president, it’s 
important to acknowledge Trump’s 
rhetoric — which is undeniably anti-
democratic — as a way to understand 
his 
authoritarian 
tendencies. 

Since taking office, Trump has 
consistently 
flouted 
democratic 

norms and expressed a willingness 

to undermine the integrity of our 
elections by claiming the electoral 
system itself is rigged against him. 
After the 2016 election, which he 
won despite losing the popular vote, 

Trump baselessly claimed on 

Twitter that, “in addition to winning 
the Electoral College in a landslide, 
I won the popular vote if you deduct 
the millions of people who voted 

illegally.” Similarly, in the lead-

up to the 2020 election, Trump 
has falsely claimed that voting by 
mail produces widespread fraud (it 
doesn’t), and therefore the election 
results may be illegitimate. 

After 
a 
group 
of 
far-right 

individuals 
plotted 
to 
kidnap 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Trump 
downplayed the severity of the 
situation and laid the blame on 
Whitmer, saying she was unpopular 
and should reopen the state by lifting 
COVID-19 safety measures. Lastly, 
and most alarmingly, he has refused 
to commit to a peaceful transition of 

power. 
These 
collectively 

demonstrate Trump’s distaste for 
democracy, lack of respect for political 
opponents and potential willingness 
to turn to authoritarian measures. 

However, despite all of his 

authoritarian rhetoric, Trump has 
demonstrated a consistent inability to 
implement anti-democratic measures 
or advance his power in meaningful 
ways. While apt and cunning 

authoritarian 
leaders 
use 
their 

powers to centralize control over 
the government and cement their 
rule, Trump has largely failed to do 
this. In addition, he has appointed a 
cabinet of partisan hacks, prioritizing 
personal loyalty over actual ability. 
This is the largest extent to which he 
has actually implemented anything 
resembling authoritarianism. 

Crucially, Trump has failed to 

centralize his power in several 
ways but primarily through his 
inability to appeal to the people 
and failure to extend the federal 
government’s 
reach. 
An 
oft-

overlooked aspect of effective 
authoritarian 
leaders 
is 
their 

ability to gain preliminary support 
through economic populism and 
other measures that actually appeal 
to 
the 
people. 
Authoritarians 

around the world and across 
history, from Benito Mussolini to 
Viktor Orban, have understood 
that; 
they 
(and 
most 
other 

authoritarians) utilized fiscal and 
economic policies which promoted 
growth among the working class 
and 
reduced 
unemployment. 

Although Trump talks a big game 
about economic populism, his only 
major economic accomplishment 
to date is a tax cut for the wealthy, 
which is both unpopular — even 
among Republicans — and perhaps 
the quintessential example of an 

anti-populist policy. To top that 
off, Trump initiated a trade war 
with China, which has ultimately 
both hurt farmers and failed to 
bring back manufacturing jobs. 
This is reflected in Trump’s 
approval ratings; although he 
frequently rails against “coastal 
elites” and positions himself as a 
protector of the working-class, he 
is more unpopular among lower-
income people than any other 
socioeconomic group.

In addition to his economic 

shortcomings, 
Trump 
has 

also struggled to advance his 
authoritarian ideals for a second 
reason: his inability to move 
the 
levers 
of 
power 
within 

government. 
For 
the 
Trump 

administration, this has come 
to the forefront primarily when 
dealing 
with 
the 
Supreme 

Court. Although the court has a 
conservative majority, Trump and 
his administration have repeatedly 
lost cases which appear politically 
winnable because of their desire to 
cut corners instead of constructing 
coherent arguments. 

Opinion

A

s 
the 
winter 
months 

approach, we begin to 
expect colder weather, 

holiday festivities, cozy nights 
in and the like. But for many, 
the earlier sunsets and barren 
trees foreshadow something far 
less jolly: seasonal depression. 
If you find yourself feeling more 
lethargic, 
less 
motivated 
or 

inclined to stay in bed for longer 
than usual as temperatures drop, 
you may have a case of the winter 
blues. If your symptoms are more 
intense, such as loss of interest 
in normally enjoyed activities, 
hopelessness and the inclination 
to isolate yourself from friends 
and 
family, 
you 
could 
be 

experiencing a more extreme 
form of the winter blues known 
as Seasonal Affective Disorder 
(SAD). 

Symptoms 
resulting 
from 

the change in season can be 
expressed in varying intensities, 
ranging from a mere low mood 
to a crippling depressive episode. 
If you’re experiencing symptoms 
of the winter blues, it’s important 
that you not only recognize such 
signs, but validate them and take 
positive steps toward a healthier 
holiday season, regardless of the 
severity.

If 
these 
symptoms 
sound 

familiar, the good news is that 
you’re not alone. According to 
Rush, about 6% of Americans 
experience SAD, and about 14% of 
Americans experience the winter 
blues. Conversely, only around 
7% of American adults have 
experienced at least one major 
depressive episode, making the 
winter blues approximately twice 
as common as major depressive 
disorder, and even more so in 
the northernmost regions of the 
country. Furthermore, women 
are more likely than men to 
struggle with SAD or the winter 
blues.

Because of the commonality 

of the winter blues, many people 
assume that they should be able 
to simply handle the symptoms, 

as so many others do. Many 
may also think that spring will 
come soon, so seeking help or 
treatment is a waste of time. 
However, 
symptoms 
of 
the 

winter blues can be debilitating 
and interrupt normal patterns 
of your daily life, no matter 
how long they last or how many 
people around you experience 
them. Your motivation to seek 
help, in any situation, should 
not be dependent on whether or 
not others do the same. If you’re 
struggling, 
you 
shouldn’t 
be 

afraid to ask for help. Of course, 
actively 
seeking 
support 
is 

easier said than done, but taking 
steps toward improvement is an 
important skill that should be 
practiced nonetheless.

The easiest steps to improving 

your mood during the winter 
can be derived directly from 
the widely accepted causes of 
seasonal depression. Both SAD 
and the winter blues result from 
the disruption of our circadian 
rhythms by the darkening of 
the skies during the season. 
Our bodies recognize that it’s 
nighttime by the amount of 
light that can be detected. When 
there’s less light, our brains 
recognize that it’s time to rest, 
and our bodies secrete melatonin, 
the natural hormone that allows 
us to sleep. Usually our bodies are 
right in their assumptions about 
when to fall asleep, however 
these assumptions begin to falter 
during the winter months. The 
darkness consumes more of the 
day and our bodies, thinking it’s 
nighttime, continue to release 
melatonin, 
causing 
daytime 

lethargy. Cue: the winter blues.

Most scientists accept that 

the lack of natural sunlight 
is the culprit. Fortunately, a 
solution exists for those who 
can access it. Light therapy 
simulates natural light, resetting 
our bodies’ internal clocks and 
mitigating the symptoms of the 
winter blues. The process simply 
requires 
one 
to 
consistently 

sit or work near a light box for 
around half an hour each day. 
Light boxes provide the natural 
light that prevents the secretion 
of melatonin at the wrong times, 
targeting the primary cause of 
the winter blues. The University 
of Michigan allows students 
to access light boxes around 
campus at no cost. These can 
be found at the Counseling And 
Psychological Services Wellness 
Zone in Pierpont Commons, 
as well as on the lower level 
of 
Shapiro 
Undergraduate 

Library. However, with COVID-
19 
limiting 
accessibility 
to 

light boxes in public spaces, 
students may find more success 
in purchasing their own light 
boxes if they can afford it to treat 
symptoms of the winter blues.

This year, though, the winter 

blues may hit a little harder than in 
past winters. Feelings of isolation 
are already widespread as a result 
of COVID-19 and the onset of the 
winter blues for many will only 
make them worse. As the winter 
approaches, make sure to safely 
stay connected with friends and 
family through socially distanced 
or virtual events. Also, given that 
so many experience symptoms 
of seasonal depression, don’t be 
afraid to talk to others about your 
feelings and reach out to your 
loved ones to help them better 
handle the lethargy of the season.

The 
winter 
blues 
are 

common, especially here in the 
northern part of the country. 
If you’re feeling more down 
than usual with the impending 
winter, you’re in the same boat 
as many others around you. 
However, this doesn’t mean you 
should simply grin and bear 
it. Your struggles are valid, 
regardless of who does or does 
not share them, so take steps to 
make the season a little more 
jolly for yourself and for your 
loved ones.

Winter blues are common, but they 

shouldn’t be downplayed

T

his 
semester 
has 
been 

particularly 
difficult 
for 

many students. The typical 

pressures of challenging classes, 
midterms 
and 
online 
learning 

combined 
with 
current 
events 

have created an extremely stressful 
semester. The lack of any school breaks 
that offered respite from schoolwork 
has worsened the situation. This needs 
to change for next semester. 

Due to COVID-19, the University 

of Michigan canceled the typical fall 
and spring breaks. Colleges across 
the country introduced this change 
to prevent students from traveling 
back and forth between campus 
and home, therefore running the 
risk of spreading COVID-19 back 
to campus or to their hometowns. 
Canceling breaks is an important 
step to help stop the spread of 
COVID-19. However, the University 
must take meaningful steps for 
next semester to make up for the 
increased academic pressure caused 
by these changes. 

The Central Student Government 

has come up with a proposal to 
help address this issue. They are 
proposing a week in the winter 
term where students will have no 
high-stakes assignments. In the 
proposal, CSG defines high-stakes 
assignments as any assignment that 
makes up more than 10% of the 
course’s grade. This week would 
give students a much-needed break 
from schoolwork without enticing 
students to go home. 

In-person 
instruction 
has 

been replaced by countless Zoom 
meetings, a format that many 
students 
find 
unconducive 
to 

learning. The switch to online school 
has left many students feeling that 
their 
instructors 
are 
assigning 

far too much work and making it 
impossible to stay on top of things. 
Most extracurricular activities have 
also been moved online, removing 
the fun from the typical out-of-class 
experiences that students enjoy. 
Last year, my clubs served as a 
much-needed break: a time to hang 
out with friends who care about 
similar issues. Although many clubs 
are making efforts to make online 
meetings enjoyable after a long day 
of Zoom classes, it can be difficult for 
students to overcome Zoom fatigue 
and attend a club meeting which is, 
yet again, online. 

These academic constraints have 

been combined with everything 
happening in the world around us. 
Concerns about our health, the health 
of others and the state of our world are 
ever-present. We have to deal with the 
stress of changing government orders 
and social isolation. The election 
has also been a major stressor for 
students. Living in a swing state where 
almost every commercial, YouTube 
advertisement and mailer is focused 
on the election has made it impossible 
to tune out the noise. Students who 
could be negatively impacted by the 
results of the election have felt the 
pressure of it on top of our academic 
and health-related stressors. 

The winter semester may be even 

more difficult than this one. Winter 
is always drearier than the fall. Given 
the high likelihood of a second wave 
of COVID-19 cases in the winter, it 
is likely that students will be stuck 
in their homes most of the time. 

With cold weather and short dark 
days, students will also be unable 
to do many stress-relieving outdoor 
activities, such as exercise, picnics 
on the Diag with friends and group 
studying in the Law Quadrangle. 

Having a week without high-

stakes 
assignments 
would 
be 

extremely helpful. Students could 
use this time to catch up on work or 
take a much-needed mental health 
break. During this time, students 
would still attend online classes 
and could have small assignments. 
Therefore, the University would 
not need to worry about students 
traveling back and forth between 
their hometowns and campus. 

Some might argue that this break 

would hinder instructors’ ability 
to teach, but it would be a welcome 
respite for them. They are also 
experiencing unique issues related 
to the pandemic, such as learning 
new technologies and adapting 
to new teaching styles while 
balancing their family lives. A week 
without having to grade tests and 
assignments would also be a break 
for them. 

We keep hearing platitudes 

from the University about how they 
support us. However, what we really 
need is action. College on its own is 
tough, and when combined with our 
current situation, it is completely 
understandable why students are 
struggling. By adopting the CSG 
proposal, the University would show 
a commitment to student mental 
health and wellbeing.

W

ith polls having closed 
and the result in — albeit, 
after a painfully long 

wait — it appears as though former 
Vice President Joe Biden has won the 
presidency while Democrats have 
kept the House of Representatives but 
fell short of taking back the Senate for 
now. Controlling the White House 
and the lower chamber of Congress 
while not having the Senate will 
complicate matters when it comes 
to climate change, which Biden 
called the “number one issue facing 
humanity.” 

Add in a 6-3 conservative 

majority in the Supreme Court 
following 
the 
confirmation 

of Amy Coney Barrett, and 
potential-President Biden will 
be facing a tough road ahead to 
pass any meaningful legislation 
to 
fight 
climate 
change 
or 

protect 
the 
environment. 

Without the support of either 
the Senate or the Supreme Court, 
Democrats will need to rely on 
the Environmental Protection 
Agency 
for 
environmental 

regulations and protections. 

On its own, the EPA cannot 

pass any legislation that would 
allocate money and resources 
toward 
an 
environmental 

project. However, it does have 
the power to pass regulations 
as well as enforce existing laws 
with fines and sanctions. The 
EPA can also take companies to 
court if they fail to comply with 
the protections. Since the EPA is 
defined as a “regulatory agency,” 

it is granted power under the 
Code of Federal Regulations to 
establish rules that people and 
corporations are required by law 
to follow. 

President Donald Trump and 

his appointed EPA administrator 
Andrew 
Wheeler 
have 

completely gutted environmental 
protections. They have rolled 
back 72 different regulations and 
are in the process of removing 27 
more, bringing the total number 
of regulations overturned to 
99. Against the advice of many
scientists, Trump’s EPA rejected
a strict standard for improving
air quality. Back in 2019, Trump
weakened 
the 
Endangered

Species Act, making it easier
to take a species off the list
and 
decreasing 
protections

for animals on it. About one
year later, Wheeler revised the
Clean Water Act, making it
easier for coal plants to pollute
neighboring rivers. Trump and
Wheeler also threw away limits
on methane restrictions at oil
and gas sites. Trump has used his 
four years in office to devastate
the environment — among many
other things — putting pressure
on the next administration to
clean up the mess. 

When Biden is sworn into 

the presidency in January of 
next year, it will be extremely 
telling who he brings into his 
administration with him. Under 
Obama, the EPA administrators 
were Lisa Jackson, a chemical 

engineer, and Gina McCarthy, 
an environmental health and 
air quality expert. If a Biden 
administration looks anything 
like 
Obama’s 
administration, 

then Biden, at the very least, 
will not nominate a former coal 
lobbyist like Trump has. 

Who 
Biden 
decides 
to 

nominate for EPA administrator 
will tell us a lot about how he 
will govern his four years as 
president. A name that has been 
floated numerous times for the 
position is Sen. Tom Carper, 
D-Del., who has been friends with 
Biden for almost 50 years. Carper 
serves as the top Democrat on
the Environment and Public 
Works Committee and has joined 
Biden in calling the climate
crisis the “the greatest crisis we
face right now on our planet.”
Carper also boasts a 100% voting
record according to the League
of Conservation Voters. Another
name being floated is U.S. Rep.
Donald McEachin, D-Va., whom
Biden trusted to put on the
Biden-Sanders unity task force
for climate change. McEachin
serves on the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce, the
Committee on Natural Resources 
and the Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis.

Other names that have been 

floated include Washington Gov. Jay 
Inslee, former Democratic Nominee 
and Secretary of State John Kerry, 
U.S. 
Rep. 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-

Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sens. Bernie 

Sanders, I-Vt., and Ed Markey, 
D-Mass. Biden’s pick will tell us a 
lot about how he will deal with the 
environment and climate change. 
He can pick a more moderate choice 
like Carper, McEachin or Kerry and 
the next four years will be filled 
with small, incremental changes. 
He could opt for a progressive 
option like Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders 
or Markey and the EPA can lead 
with bold, aggressive sweeping 
changes that will clean up our 
environment and greatly improve 
public health. While Sanders has 
called Biden “the most progressive 
Democratic nominee since Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt,” his EPA choice 
will tell us a great deal about the 
truth to that bold statement. 

While the EPA will be a 

necessary and vital tool for 
environmental policy during the 
next four years, it will also tell us 
how far left Biden is willing to go. 
During the debate, when Trump 
stated that Biden will “listen to 
the scientists” as an attempted 
insult, Biden needed only one 
word to respond, “yes.” Biden has 
repeatedly said he will “follow 
the science” despite refusing to 
commit to banning fracking, which 
a majority of scientists believe is 
destroying the environment and 
public health. Biden must make a 
progressive EPA pick in order to 
truly “listen to the scientists.”

A

t 2:47 a.m. on Nov. 9, 
2016, Wolf Blitzer said 
12 words that mortified 

half the republic: “Right now, 
a 
historic 
moment. 
CNN 

projects Donald Trump wins 
the presidency.” As a member 
of the mortified population, 
by 2:48 a.m., I was already 
looking 
ahead 
to 
2020. 

Anticipating 
— 
correctly, 

as time has shown — the 
damaging scourge a Trump 
presidency would represent, 
I, like many of my appalled 
Democratic brethren, circled 
a date on the calendar buried 
deep in an alien future: Nov. 
3, 2020. 

The 
bitter 
shock 
to 

Democrats wasn’t just that 
Trump won; it was that he 
won, and we didn’t see it 
coming. 
We 
got 
T-boned 

by 
a 
MAGA 
truck. 
Most 

Democrats, and perhaps even 
a good deal of Republicans, 
expected Hillary Clinton to 
win the election; as terrifying 
as the specter of a Trump 
victory 
was, 
we 
knew 
it 

would never come to fruition. 
Hillary, flawed as she might 
have been, was going to win, 
and the dumpster fire that 
was 
the 
Trump 
campaign 

would be rightly relegated to 
the landfill of history. 2016 
was already licked, sealed and 
stamped.

It was a numbers game, 

a 
question 
of 
statistics, 

and it lulled us into a naive 
complacency. By most polling 
metrics, Hillary should have 
cruised to victory on Nov. 8, 
2016. 
FiveThirtyEight, 
one 

of the most reliable election 
forecasters, gave Hillary a 
70.9% chance of winning on 
the eve of the election — not 

a shoo-in, but comfortable 
odds if you were on the 
blue team. Predicting more 
than 300 electoral votes for 
the 
Democratic 
nominee, 

FiveThirtyEight 
believed 

Wisconsin,
Michigan, 

Pennsylvania, 
Iowa, 
Ohio, 

North Carolina and Florida 
would 
cast 
blue 
electoral 

votes. All of these states went 
red, and in doing so delivered 
Trump a healthy electoral 
college victory.

Is the 2016 phenomenon 

playing 
out 
again? 
As 

of 
Wednesday, 
Oct. 
28, 

FiveThirtyEight 
gives 
Joe 

Biden 
an 
88% 
chance 
of 

bringing home the bacon. The 
bitter memory of 2016 should 
remind Democrats, though, 
that victory is not assured. 
Wisconsin, 
Michigan 
and 

Pennsylvania do lean blue 
according to the polls and if 
that holds, Biden should win. 
But Wisconsin, Michigan and 
Pennsylvania 
leaned 
blue 

according to the polls in 2016, 
and if that held, Hillary would 
have won. Look how that 
turned out. 

We have to be wary of 

putting too much faith in 
these metrics, and we can’t be 
surprised if a similar scenario 
unravels 
again. 
If 
Trump 

holds the swing states in the 
South 
— 
Florida, 
Georgia 

and North Carolina — as well 
as Ohio, all of a sudden he’s 
well within striking distance. 
There are a million ways the 
electoral map could play out, 
but the upshot is that this 
thing could be a lot closer 
than many seem to believe. 
While Biden should win, we 
shouldn’t be shell-shocked if 
Trump does.

So, what happens if 2016 

happens again? Even if Trump 
finesses another upset victory, 
Biden will almost certainly 
have 
still 
captured 
the 

popular vote, and likely to the 
tune of several million. If this 
is the case, the Democratic 
Party ought to prioritize the 
abolition 
of 
the 
Electoral 

College — a move that more 
than 
half 
of 
Americans 

favor — to be replaced with 
the 
popular 
vote. 
And 
it 

would be entirely justified. 
Since 2000, the Republican 
nominee will have won the 
popular vote, indicative of 
the real will of the voting 
public, only one time in the 
past six presidential contests. 
Despite this, the Republican 
candidate will have won three 
out of the past six elections. 
Does that sound like healthy 
democracy to you? 

But 
for 
the 
Democratic 

Party, there are also bigger, 
harder questions they will 
have to face in the event of 
a loss. Questions of identity 
— the soul of the party. In 
the 
past 
two 
presidential 

elections, 
Democratic 

primary voters would have 
tapped the “safe,” moderate 
establishment 
candidate 
— 

Clinton and Biden — and lost. 
It’s more than just identifying 
that the “safe” candidate isn’t 
the surest route to victory: 
it’s identifying that Trumpian 
populism invigorates people, 
and hardly anyone actually 
gets excited about voting for 
Biden. For many voters, Biden 
is simply the lesser of two 
evils; they are against Trump, 
and they are consequently for 
Biden. 

A party defining itself by 

what it is against more than 
what it is for is sure to excite 
no one. I recognize that these 
are exceptional times, and 
that the 2020 presidential 
election was always bound 
to 
be 
a 
referendum 
on 

Trump. But if the Democrats 
lose again, they’ll need a 
facelift. There’s clearly an 
appetite for populism in the 
republic, and they need to 
be better salespeople. Only 
by incorporating some of the 
party’s 
left-wing 
elements 

— 
the 
Bernie 
Sanders/

Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez 

faction — can the Democrats 
gain 
a 
clearer 
sense 
of 

identity.

Republicans will scream, 

as some already are, that 
the Democrats have become 
socialists, 
and 
they 
will 

appeal to Americans’ primal 

fear of socialism à la Eugene 
McCarthy. Let them say what 
they will. To associate the left 
wing of the Democratic Party 
with the hammer and sickle is 
an anti-intellectual cop-out, a 
way to protect conservatives 
from having to actually debate 
their ideas. 

But this is really a different 

discussion for a different day. 
And perhaps, in the event 
of a victory, the Democrats 
will not have to consider 
a reconfiguration of their 

party’s identity. But if Biden 

loses fair and square on Nov. 
3, one thing becomes clear: 
if the moderate wing of the 
party can’t beat someone as 
incompetent and insane as 
Trump, it’s become no country 
for the old Dems.

I 

know something Michigan 
State University has that 
we don’t.

It’s something that, despite 

the 
interconnectedness 
of 

our campus with downtown 
Ann Arbor, the city has not 
managed to acquire.

It’s something that would 

be a major convenience to 
students and other residents of 
the downtown area, something 
that would increase downtown 
foot 
traffic 
and 
stimulate 

downtown businesses.

It is: a grocery store.
In July 2019, supermarket 

chain 
Target 
opened 
a 

“small-format” 
store 
in 

downtown East Lansing. The 
store is essentially a scaled-
down version of a typical 
Target 
supermarket, 
with 

the 
exception 
of 
reduced 

children’s clothing and toy 
sections. Otherwise, all of the 
clothing and home goods that 
can be found at the average 
supermarket can be found 
there, with a quarter of the 
store devoted to food and 
groceries.

The (relatively) new store’s 

best feature? It’s located on 
Grand River Avenue, which is 
in the heart of East Lansing’s 
downtown area and is right 
across the street from MSU’s 
campus.

After two years of living 

here, I’m surprised that Ann 
Arbor doesn’t have its own 
downtown 
supermarket. 

There’s 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 

Farmers Market in Kerrytown, 
which sells plenty of local 
produce but is, of course, only 
a seasonal offering. There’s 
a Walgreens on the corner 
of State Street and North 
University Avenue, but unless 
you are committed to fulfilling 
the college student stereotype 
of surviving solely on instant 
ramen, you can’t live off of 
what is sold there. Instead, 
anybody living near downtown 
Ann Arbor who wants to 
do any sort of substantial, 
reliable grocery shopping is 
consigned to making a trip to 
Meijer, Target, Trader Joe’s 
or another grocery store well 
away from the city center. For 
many students, the distance 
to even the closest of these 
destinations is impractical to 
travel without the help of a bus 
or car.

This configuration is by no 

means unusual in American 
cities, but that doesn’t mean 
that relocating supermarkets 
and 
grocery 
stores 
won’t 

benefit 
communities, 

especially 
a 
college 
town 

like Ann Arbor, where high 
concentrations of students — 
many of whom don’t own cars 
— live close to downtown.

The most obvious benefit 

of downtown supermarkets 
is 
convenience. 
Given 
a 

downtown shopping location, 
students would easily be able 
to incorporate shopping into 
trips to and from class or 
work. The epic journey down 
Ann Arbor-Saline Road to 
Meijer, on the other hand, 
takes 
around 
10 
minutes 

by car, and isn’t on the way 
to anything but a couple of 
nearby fast food places. If 
a small-format Meijer was 
located on State Street, for 
example, students could pick 
up the week’s produce on the 
way home from class at Mason 
Hall, with only a block’s worth 
of extra walking, rather than 
having to carve out an hour or 
two of their time a week for 
a trip to Meijer’s current and 

closest location.

Other downtown businesses 

would benefit from a nearby 
grocery store as well. As well-
loved as local independent 
businesses like Dawn Treader 
Book Shop and Underground 
Sounds are, most people would 
consider their need for food to 
be greater than their need for 
fine literature; a supermarket 
would bring to the downtown 
area 
people 
who 
might 

not 
otherwise 
patronize 

downtown small businesses, 
helping to keep the local 
institutions 
that 
give 
Ann 

Arbor its unique character in 
robust health.

It’s clear that the addition 

of 
a 
supermarket 
to 
the 

downtown area would benefit 
both students and Ann Arbor 
residents 
and 
businesses. 

But why would supermarket 
companies be interested in 
making such an expansion? As 
it turns out, downtown areas 
provide them with a unique 
opportunity for growing their 
businesses. According to an 
article from the Michigan 
Retailers Association, urban 
regions could serve as vital 
areas of expansion for chains 
like Meijer. As Cindy Ciura, 
principal of Bloomfield Hills-
based 
consulting 
firm 
CC 

Consulting, said, “If I’m a 
Meijer, how am I going to grow 
my business? I’m everywhere I 
want to be in suburbia.”

Opening stores downtown 

would also help businesses 
adapt to trends of increasing 
urbanization. 
According 

to data from the Southeast 
Michigan 
Council 
of 

Governments, Ann Arbor and 
Detroit led the region in new 
residential permits in 2016. 
The vast majority of the new 
permits were for apartments 
(95% in Detroit and 85% in 
Ann 
Arbor) 
signalling 
an 

increase 
in 
high-density 

residential 
areas. 
These 

increasing urban populations 
will need expanded retail and 
grocery offerings to meet their 
needs, and supermarkets can 
increase revenue by opening 
more downtown locations to 
fill this growing demand.

The 
Michigan 
Retailers’ 

Association article does concede 
that the costs of building, owning 
and operating businesses in 
downtown areas are higher 
than in suburban areas, and 
that some supermarket chains, 
like Walmart, have failed to 
construct a successful business 
model around small-scale stores. 
The fact that there are plenty of 
businesses that are still willing 
to try, however, shows that the 
potential benefits are well 
worth those costs. Target’s move 
into East Lansing, for example, 
was part of a larger effort to 
expand its number of small-
format stores from 65 to 130 
between 2018 and 2019.

Today, 
Target 
only 
has 

100 small-format stores, but 
those that have opened have 
continued to be financially 
successful, 
and 
plans 
are 

underway to construct more. 
The City of Ann Arbor should 
take advantage of Target and 
other companies’ willingness 
to invest in a new format of 
grocery store, and provide our 
community with an alternative 
to 
suburban 
supermarkets. 

One that will bring more 
people downtown and increase 
the vibrancy of our urban 
community.

T

oxic masculinity and its 
dangers 
are 
becoming 

more known, and you likely 

already know of examples embodying 
it, from nonsense that “men don’t cry” 
to certain things being deemed “gay” 
with a demeaning connotation. Yet, the 
intersection between toxic masculinity 
and eating disorders, specifically ones 
that revolve around fitness — think 
the avid gym-goer that won’t eat a bit 
outside of their macros for the day — is 
undeniable. 

Toxic 
masculinity 
boasts 
a 

message of what a man should look 
like physically, equally as much as 
it sends messages discouraging the 
prioritization of emotional and mental 
health. In fact, culture of suppressing 
one’s emotions and feelings, which 
is a crucial component of toxic 
masculinity, could not exist alone; it has 
to be paired with physical strength. 
In other words, the physically strong 
appearance of men is the outer shell, 
housing their equally tough inner-self, 
which they have been socialized to 
believe is necessary for manhood. 

To meet these physical and 

behavioral expectations, they grasp 
for things they can control. Food and 
exercise are examples of these things, 
and in my experience, turning to them 
for a sense of control can quickly turn 
into misuse or abuse and a strained 
relationship with two things that 
are needed to live a high-quality life. 
Furthermore, unless these behaviors 
are addressed early on as being 
actually harmful to holistic health, 
men will continue to engage with 
it under the guise that in doing so, 

they’re leading a healthy lifestyle. 

You likely already know that 

sufferers of eating disorders tend to be 
female. But, the usually lower number 
of males suffering from eating disorders 
is likely underreported. There are a few 
reasons for this, but a main one being 
the stigma around eating disorders 
that can lead to feelings of shame or 
embarrassment. However, I want to 
dig beyond this into the population of 
males who might not even think they 
have an eating disorder or on a path of 
disordered eating — guys who are pure 
muscle, live at the gym (or wherever 
their choice setting of workout may be) 
and track everything they put in their 
mouth. 

While current statistics say men 

make up 25% of those suffering from 
anorexia, there is reason to believe 
this number is actually higher because 
of the tendency for anorexia to be 
defined in its most narrow, outdated 
form as merely severe restricted 
eating. This doesn’t include atypical 
anorexia, which may still include 
severe restricted eating — which isn’t 
atypical at all — nor anorexia athletica, 
which is specifically relevant since its 
defining characteristic of excessive 
exercise is the feature also present in 
toxic masculinity. 

With toxic masculinity promoting 

a pursuit of strength, it is completely 
understandable 
that 
guys 
have 

turned to exercise, specifically weight 
training, to pursue this because it’s 
the most tangible avenue under 
their control. And I can’t dispute the 
benefits of strength training, nor do I 
want to. What I want to call attention 

to is the culture that encourages it to 
its extreme, more often than not also 
leading to disordered eating patterns, 
if not full-fledged eating disorders, and 
for all the wrong reasons. 

Reasons of physical appearance 

and wanting to feel stronger are not 
“bad” in and of itself, but when you are 
conditioned to believe that you have 
to attain a certain physique before 
you can be anything more, and that 
you have to be stronger because of 
some notion that you have to be ready 
to fight at a moment’s notice — all of 
which today’s males are conditioned 
to believe, in short — it becomes 
increasingly difficult to engage in 
activities like weight training that 
would otherwise be beneficial to 
your holistic health, without these 
detrimental underlying reasons. 

Even if one is truly pursuing weight 

training for all the right reasons, 
disassociated from toxic masculinity, 
this person is likely in the minority. It 
is incredibly difficult for people to fully 
abstain from societal expectations 
and social and gender norms because 
it’s human nature to want to meet 
them. Most people then, naturally, 
have fallen to the various pressures 
that exist, and will continue to do so 
until we change the norms, pressures 
and cultures themselves, rather than 
berate the individuals merely trying 
to successfully exist under them. 

A look into the thoughts men hold 

around their bodies and how exercise 
and fitness plays a role then shows 
that the wrong reasons discussed 
earlier — the ones rooted in harmful 
and largely unhealthful beliefs about 

what it means to be a man — are 
rampant. A study surveying the 
attitudes and beliefs among college 
men on body image and ideals found 
that they feel heightened pressure 
to have a muscular body. In addition 
to being preoccupied with building 
muscles, they were also very focused 
on obtaining a very low level of body 
fat, and the more dissatisfied they 
were “with their muscularity and 
body fat, the more they engaged in 

unhealthy behaviors.” 

It should come as no surprise 

then, that we’ve seen “bigorexia” 
enter the eating disorder scene in 
recent years. Also referred to as the 
Adonis Complex, this eating disorder 
is characterized by an obsession 
with one’s body, specifically a desire 
to build more and more muscle, 
known 
as 
muscle 
dysmorphia. 

Body dysmorphia is also a crucial 
component of it in that individuals 

suffering from it view themselves 
as “weak” or “small” even when 
they are very visibly muscular to 
others. This then leads them to 
engage in more extreme behaviors 
(e.g. anabolic steroids) to build 
even more muscle. 

Opinion

SIERRA ÉLISE HANSEN | COLUMNIST

T

he United States historically 
has been eager to meddle 
with Latin American affairs. 

From the Monroe Doctrine to the 
overthrowing of the democratically 
elected Salvador Allende in Chile, 
American imperialism has a long 
and storied history. Our penchant 
for interfering didn’t stop when 
we entered the 21st century, with 
Venezuela and Bolivia as the newest 
targets. 
Just 
recently, 
former 

President Evo Morales’s Movement 
for Socialism Party won an election 
with a wide margin of victory. This 
is following a U.S.-backed coup in the 
country that brought a right-leaning 
leader, Jeanine Áñez, in power. 
Her party’s loss is a victory for the 
people of Bolivia and is an example 
of a spectacular failure of the U.S.’s 
meddling in Latin America. But to 
understand why and what it means, 
we must look at Morales and his party.

Morales is a deeply popular 

figure in Bolivia, not only for the 
good work he’s done but also for 
what he represents. Morales was 
Bolivia’s 
first-ever 
ndigenous 

president. He started his political 
career as a leader of a coca-growing 
union and has kept that as a point of 
pride during his tenure as president. 
As 
president, 
he 
established 

infrastructure 
and 
instituted 

regulations that prioritized native 

farmers in the rural area for 
economic stability. Last year, in the 
rural province of Chapare, Morales 
received 90% of the vote. He 
rewrote the Bolivian constitution 
to enfranchise more people and 
to solidify the rights of indigenous 
peoples all over the country. The 
average annual GDP increase under 
Morales was nearly 5% per year, and 
he halved poverty from 36% to 17%. 
Morales nationalized the oil and 
gas industry and redistributed 
millions of acres of land. Through 
the nationalized industry, he built 
more than 4,500 schools in rural 
and impoverished areas. Other 
socialist policies he instituted 
included a pension for low-income 
people aged 60 and above and 
welfare policies for uninsured 
young mothers. Morales changed 
Bolivia for the better.

Why would the U.S. want to 

overthrow someone who brought 
stability and prosperity to their 
country? One of the main motives 
was the aforementioned eagerness 
to nationalize industry. Bolivia holds 
one of the most abundant deposits 
of lithium in the world, an element 
necessary to create products like 
batteries and solar panels. In 2019, 
Morales reportedly won the election 
with a 10.1-percentage-point lead 
in votes, just barely a tenth of a 

percent higher than the lead needed 
to prevent a runoff election. The 
Organization of American States 
led an investigation shortly after 
accusations of electoral fraud were 
slung around, and concluded that 
they found “serious irregularities.” 

The problem with the OAS is that 

it has historically been used as a tool 
for the U.S. to advance their own 
goals, especially throughout the Cold 
War. The OAS was notably complicit 
with the U.S.’s infringement on the 
national sovereignty of Guatemala 
when they tried to nationalize the 
fruit companies. Banana republics 
were assets to the U.S. given the 
revenue they generated. Another 
notable example was during the 
Cuban Missile Crisis, when the 
OAS collectively agreed to impose 
a quarantine on Cuba, preventing 
anything or anyone from crossing 
the country’s borders. They are 
historically a political tool for the 
U.S. and didn’t prove themselves 
any different here. In the end, the 
discrepancies were easy to refute 
but Evo was forcibly removed in 
another instance of American 
imperialism.

O

ur nation’s leaders have long 
been engaged in a deadlock 
due to disagreements over 

the new coronavirus federal aid 
package. America is at a juncture 
of crises and there is one critical 
solution: providing relief through ease 
of access to necessary assistance. If 
its legislature does not do something 
to this end for the improvement 
of 
unemployment 
conditions, 

Michigan will likely see a deadly and 
costly mental health catastrophe 
substantially worsened by a rapid 
increase in homelessness. 

The agonizing uncertainty of 

waiting for unemployment benefits or 
other forms of government assistance 
to process is an issue affecting the 
American people on an unprecedented 
scale.

Without 
timely 
access 
to 

unemployment 
benefits, 
many 

Michigan residents will be evicted, 
go hungry and lose access to critical 
care. With people waiting for five 
months or longer to receive any 
unemployment assistance at all — 
even after being approved — bills 
will not be paid. Resulting evictions 
along with other life-shattering 
changes 
caused 
by 
financial 

hardships could have repercussions 
for years to come. 

This week, I spoke to labor lawyer 

and University of Michigan Clinical 

Assistant Professor of Law Rachael 
Kohl. She was able to explain why 
Michigan is falling short of adequate 
emergency provisions for its residents. 
Perhaps more importantly, she was 
able to shed light on what our state 
government can do, now and in the 
future, to remedy these shortcomings.

Kohl currently serves as clinical 

director of the Workers’ Rights law 
clinic at the University of Michigan 
Law School. Her colleagues and the 
law students under her supervision 
provide pro bono assistance to 
Michigan residents from across 
the state — they have helped many 
residents fight to receive adequate 
and timely funding. For some, 
these emergency funds represent a 
critical lifeline for staying afloat in an 
unprecedented crisis — for others, a 
depiction of the money as a lifeline is 
terrifyingly literal. Michigan residents 
are facing eviction and food shortages. 
There has been a devastating rise 
in the number of overdoses and 
suicides with the looming threat of 
more mental and physical health 
crises. Under our current system, 
health insurance is not ubiquitously 
available to pay for potentially life-
saving treatment. For many residents, 
their health insurance is tied to 
employment. 

Kohl detailed how many of 

these Michigan residents not only 

navigated a system they may have 
never encountered before but have 
also been forced to navigate a system 
ill-equipped 
for 
unemployment 

numbers that would have seemed 
inconceivable only a year ago. As 
she described Michigan’s current 
unemployment crisis and how it 
stacks up against similar scenarios 
playing out around the country, she 
provided a comprehensive picture of 
precarious and unforgiving realities 
unemployed Michiganders can face.

“It’s been an overwhelming need 

for unemployment in the state,” she 
said. “That need is only exacerbated 
by the fact that the unemployment 
insurance agency had to try to figure 
out a way to process more claims, in the 
last seven months, than they’ve had to 
process in combination (over the) past 
six or seven years.”

Kohl further stated that the way 

unemployment insurance is funded 
piles even more bureaucratic procedures 
on top of already urgent and dire 
conditions shaped by a global pandemic. 
“The 
way 
that 
unemployment 

insurance is funded is based on the 
last quarter’s unemployment rate, and 
so the federal government didn’t give 
states more money to increase its ability 
to hire more people and train more 
people until well into the actual need,” 
she said.

This particular mention of federal 

funding sounded like a harbinger of 
more explanations to come, concerning 
federal impediments to funding. 
Trumpian and national right-to-work 
politics have hindered workers’ ability 
to seek legal recourse to statutes. But 
the reasons some Michigan residents 
have been suspended — in limbo 
and without relief — extend much 
further back than the overwhelming, 

dystopian climate of a Trump 

presidency.

Zach, a junior in LSA studying 

economics whose name has been 
changed to protect his privacy, 
said he applied for unemployment 
back in May, when he would have 
started his summer lifeguarding 
job had it not evaporated due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. He received 
the first round of the Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security 
Act funds relatively quickly and 
reported encountering a relatively 
short two-and-a-half week delay 

before receiving another round 

of emergency funding, which he 
applied for at the beginning of 
August to purchase the school 
supplies he needed. However, he 
described encountering consistent 
barriers to clear communication. 
He said he experienced high levels 
of anxiety while waiting for other 
funds to come in because he did not 
have the possibility or safety net of 

another income. 

In July, after Zach fixed what he 

described as a “stupid error” over 
the phone — the worker he spoke 
to told him Zach had switched 
his first and last name — the same 
worker told Zach he’d be receiving 
his funds shortly. But Zach said he is 
still stuck on the “pending payment” 
status, according to his online 
unemployment portal, and has not 
received any funds. He continues to 
call each week and says that most 
times he is not able to get through to 
anyone at all — his calls will often go 
to an automated voicemail box and 
the agency’s computer will hang up.

During 
our 
conversation, 

Kohl outlined the litany of ways 
our 
Michigan 
legislature 
has 

historically failed to update state 
labor statutes that govern the 
distribution 
of 
unemployment 

funds in the state, which have in 
turn harmed workers. Moreover, 
she declared the statutes were 
encoded in a notoriously unreliable 
computer system that has harmed 
Michigan’s workers in the past. 
She provided an abundance of 
statistical 
evidence 
supporting 

the claims that Michigan’s state 
statutes 
frequently 
undermine 

the well-being of the workers who 
need it most, including the students 
who may depend on a second 

income stemming from work that 
no longer exists because of the 
pandemic.

“One of the biggest issues through 

Michigan for unemployment ... I’d say 
it’s a two-fold issue. The first issue is 
the Michigan statute ... is incredibly 
restrictive,” Kohl emphasized. “It 
is one of the most restrictive state 
statutes governing unemployment 
out of any of the rest of the country. 
We are in the bottom, I’d say bottom 
five to bottom ten states for how 
many workers we actually cover and 
how well we cover them.” Kohl stated 
a failure to account for inflation 
plays a large role in Michigan’s 
unemployment statutes lagging far 
behind the rest of the states.

“We have one of the lowest weekly 

benefit amounts meaning the most 
you can get in the state is $362 per 
week,” she said. “... It used to be 
tied to inflation and then in 2002 
it was removed from being tagged 
with inflation, so it’s just remained 
stagnant for almost twenty years. 
$362 in 2002 represented about 58% 
of the average weekly wage of the 
state, now it’s less than 35% of the 
average weekly wage of the state.”

MUSIC REVIEW
BOOK REVIEW

‘Clockface’: Costello’s aim is the same
‘Real Life’ is 
raw, complex

Though the title track of 

Elvis Costello’s latest album 
describes him in a battle 
against 
time, 
the 
English 

songwriter definitely has a 
habit for creating timeless 
listening 
experiences. 
In 

a career spanning over 40 
years, Costello has earned 
the reputation of being a 
musical chameleon. While in 
his earlier years he cemented 
himself as a pioneering punk 
rock rebel, his more recent 
work 
is 
characterized 
by 

experimentation in a variety of 
styles from jazz to bluegrass. 
Regardless 
of 
the 
musical 

form he takes on, Costello has 
always stayed consistent with 
his sharp, witty vocals and off-
beat persona.

Costello’s 
latest 
album, 

Hey 
Clockface, 
represents 

a continuation of his sonic 
exploration. 
Rather 
than 

delivering 
high 
energy, 

angsty punk rock tracks, Hey 
Clockface 
continues 
upon 

many of the ideas introduced 
in Costello’s earlier album, 
Look Now. The songs in Hey 
Clockface have a much slower 
tempo than what is typically 
found in Costello’s discography, 
allowing the tracks to relish 
in their rich instrumentation 

and production. If Costello has 
been known to deliver some 
burning shots of tequila, Hey 
Clockface serves the audience 
a full glass of fine wine. 

Three of Hey Clockface’s 

tracks 
were 
recorded 
in 

Helsinki, while the rest were 
recorded in Paris along with 
a full band led by longtime 
Costello 
collaborator, 
Steve 

Nieve. The tracks recorded in 
Helsinki have an urgent, lo-fi 
sound. Costello’s voice sounds 
pent up as if he struggles 
to 
deliver 
the 
lines. 
“No 

Flag,” which was recorded in 
Helsinki, is full of cynical lyrics 
which 
match 
exceptionally 

well with the feel of the song. 
In contrast, the songs recorded 
in Paris are slower, jazzier and 
more subtle. These songs range 
from “I Do (Zula’s Song),” a 
slow jazz ballad with excellent 
woodwind and brass lines to 
“The Last Confession of Vivian 
Whip,” a sweet, slow piano tune 
which tells an interesting story 
through Costello’s emblematic 
songwriting mastery.

Listening to Costello sing 

on much slower tracks allows 
the listener to appreciate the 
subtle textures of Costello’s 
voice. His delivery of the 
bluesy political anthem “We 
Are All Cowards Now” is raspy 
and pleading as the character 
laments for a time before 
society became soft and vain. 

The powerful spoken word on 
“Revolution #49” and “Radio 
is Everything” demonstrate 
Costello’s 
impressive 
tonal 

range and ability to create 
interesting moods within his 
track lists.

Though the individual tracks 

on Hey Clockface demonstrate 
Costello’s mastery of the craft 
of songwriting, the overall 
production of the album is 
severely 
underwhelming. 

There are many thematic and 
musical links between the 
tracks on this album — such 
as the recurring theme of 
communication incongruities 
within relationships — but 
Costello’s album suffers from 
a severe lack of cohesion. 
The track list ricochets from 
lighthearted tunes with sweet 
lyrics to more serious songs 
interwoven 
with 
complex 

melodramatic 
textures. 

Though both songs are great 
in their own right, “No Flag’s” 
punchy, overdriven production 
doesn’t sound all too good 
on the same side of the richly 
produced and indulgent “I Do”. 
The result of this mismatch 
makes the album feel like a 
collection of b-sides left on the 
cutting room floor at multiple 
points in Costello’s career, 
stitched up and packaged for 
release. 

The 
quality 
also 
varies 

jarringly between tracks on the 

album. Aside from the obvious 
tonal divide between the songs 
recorded in Paris and Helsinki, 
the difference in production 
quality from track to track is 
noticeable. In one extreme 
example, the vocals on “Radio 
is 
Everything” 
sound 
half 

baked, almost as if Costello’s 
voice was recorded through 
a laptop microphone. I even 
listened to this track through 
multiple 
audio 
sources 
to 

make sure the issue wasn’t just 
with me and it sounded just 
as uncomfortable no matter 
what I listened to it on. The 
unfortunate result of this lack 
of quality control is that the 
impact of the more brilliant 
moments and beautiful lyrics 
is 
reduced 
by 
distracting 

production.

Though it’s a bit of a 

mess, it’s a beautiful mess 
nonetheless. 
Hey 
Clockface 

proves what we already know 
about Costello: He’s a master at 
creating beautiful songs with 
compelling, intricate lyrics. 
Though Hey Clockface may 
not cut out to stand out among 
the many titans of Costello’s 
discography, it is certainly an 
album worth paying attention 
to, especially if you are looking 
to learn from a true master.

DIGITAL CULTURE NOTEBOOK
On TikTok and Penelope Scott

For as long as the modern music 

industry has been around, the 
idea of scenes has been critical to 
understanding how the artform 
evolves. Geographic regions and 
even individual cities are often 
tied to a certain subgenre, from the 
east coast vs. west coast era of hip-
hop to the incredibly influential 
Chicago house scene. It’s no 
surprise, then, that in the digital 
era, new music scenes are popping 
up on different websites and apps. 
The mid-late 2010s were, after all, 
dominated by the lo-fi trap sounds 
of “SoundCloud rap.” 

Despite SoundCloud’s work in 

establishing the internet as a viable 
place to develop new innovative 
sounds, few people saw TikTok’s 
rise to dominance over the music 
industry coming. TikTok is a social 
media app, primarily aimed at Gen 
Z kids, that succeeded Musical.
ly as the number one source for 
short videos of people dancing. 
It is wildly successful, ranking 
alongside giants like Twitter and 
Instagram as one of the most 
popular social media platforms. 
But don’t let TikTok’s surface 
appearance as an inconsequential 
trend platform, like Vine before 
it, trick you. TikTok is much more 
than just dancing videos, and 
has clearly made an impact in 
everything from politics (TikTok 
was where thousands of teens 
organized to reserve seats at a high 
profile Trump rally, contributing 
to the embarrassingly low turnout) 
to the music industry itself (“Old 
Town Road,” one of the biggest 
pop songs of all time, started as a 
TikTok song). 

TikTok is scarily good at 

personalizing content for the user. 
The almighty algorithm is nearly 
mythical in the way it is revered 
by users, allowing anyone who 
regularly uses the platform to end 
up in incredibly specific niche 
areas. It is within these many sides 
of TikTok that indie musicians can 
thrive. It’s hard to overstate how 
much one viral TikTok can change 
a musician’s career. “Vices,” a 
single by Mothica, hit number two 
on the iTunes chart off nothing 
but TikTok hype, materializing 
a music career for Mothica out 
of nowhere. Previously obscure 
Swedish indie musician Girl In 
Red’s lo-fi sapphic love songs 
have become so well known in 
the LGBTQ+ corner of the app 
that “listening to Girl In Red” has 
become synonymous with being a 
lesbian. 

After 
seeing 
the 
influence 

TikTok has had over the music 
industry, many may ask questions 
like “Does TikTok music have a 

specific sound, like SoundCloud 
before it?”, “What is it like for 
those who make it big off of a 
minute-long viral video?” and of 
course, “How much staying power 
do these musicians really have?”

Well, ask no longer, because I 

sat down over Zoom with college 
student, amateur musician and 
overnight success story Penelope 
Scott to get her take on the 
TikTok effect. Scott gained rapid 
popularity on TikTok under the 
username @worsethanithot after 
her song Born to Run went viral.

This interview has been edited 

for clarity and concision.

The Michigan Daily: My first 

question for you is: what was your 
original motivation to join TikTok? 
When did you join it? Did you join 
it intending to post music content 
on there, or did you just join it as 
a social media and end up doing 
music later on? 

Penelope Scott: I definitely did 

not join it expecting to post music. 
I joined it mostly to see content. I 
thought the jokes were funny and 
I wanted to see the memes. And I 
also wanted to see what my friends 
were doing. And some of them 
were on tiktok. So I thought that 
was a good thing to be in touch 
with … I posted a lot of videos of 
my friends, and then I posted a 
few of music. And when it started 
to become a music account, I took 
all the videos of people that maybe 
didn’t want to be part of my brand 
off of it and kind of transformed 
it into that account. But that’s 
definitely not how it started. 

TMD: So what was your 

original motivation to start posting 
music related videos? What was 
the first thing you posted? Why’d 
you post it? 

PS: Oh, I think it must have been 

some of the homework projects 
I was making for my music class 
at the time ... I go to a school that 
has some music equipment. And 
when COVID happened a lot of 
the students had to go online. We 
had to switch to a free software 
that everyone could use. And so we 
used LMMS 1.2.1 And it’s like just 
the free open source software. I 
like it a lot. And I have a lot of other 
software that I use to edit audio 
that I used to edit my voice. But 
all of the beats on the new, like the 
backdrops on the new songs are in 
LMMS. 

TMD: Really? 
PS: Yeah. Yeah. So that’s what a 

lot of the first ones were because I 
was doing homework regularly so 
I would turn in like a piece. And 
then I would extend that into a 
song and put it on the Internet. 

TMD: Yeah, I will definitely 

get into that when we talk about 
the album. So generally, can you 
give me an overview, a summary 

of how your career has changed or 
even come to be if you didn’t really 
have one before? Like, how has in 
the past ... like you said, you started 
during COVID, so in the past 
couple months of making music 
and putting it on tiktok, how has 
your career changed?

PS: I guess it’s just been a 

crazy trajectory up of people 
knowing about the songs that I 
make. And I guess it would have 
started — so Sweet Hibiscus Tea, 
the video, blew up in late May. 
And Born to Run blew up around 
the same time. But it travels very 
differently online because the 
audio got banned. So that’s a lot 
more people spreading it without 
it being attached to me and finding 
out later like where it comes from. 
And then sweet hibiscus tea is 
pretty straightforward. So from 
that point on, it’s just been like 
this rapid growth of numbers and 
the amount of people that I’m 
interacting with. I used to be able 
to answer everybody’s comments 
and questions and kind of be 
very personal with people. And 
now it takes a lot longer to get to 
the bottom of the DMs. So that’s 
definitely a big change. Yeah. It’s 
been a pretty steady, very stable 
upward trend on Spotify, which I 
think is a good sign. 

TMD: So to provide some 

perspective for people who are 
not as familiar with online culture 
things, who know the more 
traditional music industry ... have 
you seen any success with that? 
Has anybody, like, tried to reach 
out to you for like record deals or 
stuff? Have you gotten any more 
traditional music career things? 

PS: Yeah. So I have had a few 

record labels reach out to me. 
Not necessarily ... I think, I think 
making a deal is more ... That’s a 
little in the past at this point. They 
kind of just want to trade contact 
information and keep you kind of 
in their orbit so that if you have a 
request, you can make it. And then 
you’ll settle on a deal. I haven’t 
settled on a deal with a record label 
because I use a distributor called 
Distro Kid, which works for me. 
And they just put all the things that 
I make onto Spotify and Apple, and 
they do it for about thirty dollars a 
year, which is pretty cool. 

TMD: So that’s how your 

career changed. How has like ... 
And obviously, you don’t need to 
go near too many personal details 
if you don’t want to. How has 
your life changed? How has your 
personal life been affected by this 
sudden growth? 

PS: Well, it’s weird because 

because it’s so online, my day to 
day life isn’t that much different. 
I’m still going to school, still 
studying politics, still doing all 
the normal things I was going to 

do. But it is, like, a significant part 
of my day, checking social media. 
And when I was putting out the 
album, that would take hours out 
of the day to just kind of set up my 
little recording area in the room, 
knock out a song, edit it. And it’s 
also interesting to have people who 
have not seen me or talk to me in a 
while realize that they recognized 
my voice on one of the songs that 
they’ve heard somewhere else and 
kind of like circle back and be like, 
Hey, are you doing music now? 
And I’m like, I am. And it’s weird 
that you know that. But thank you.

TMD: So, you’ve obviously 

been in the music world or at least 
aware of what’s going on in music 
for a few years, even if you’ve not 
been super successful and active 
in making music that whole time. 
How do you think the music 
industry itself has changed the 
past couple years with things like 
TikTok and especially recently 
with COVID, which you’ll have 
more experience with that ... 

PS: Well, I definitely think that 

it’s a lot more artist friendly and a 
lot more user friendly. I think artist 
friendly platforms like Bandcamp 
are a big deal. The idea that things 
are pretty straightforward and 
you can kind of just do this on the 
side and not have it take up a lot 
of your day. And then if it starts 
to pick up, then you can choose to 
allocate more time. But I also think 
that TikTok especially is a really 
interesting one, because it kind of 
paves the way for other platforms 
that might link audio. And like, you 
can trace a meme back through a 
song. That’s really interesting to 
me. I think it has a huge impact 
on tying various pieces of art that 
relate to one song together. And 
that’s pretty cool. It’s definitely 
helped me get in touch with people 
who are, in the future, going to do 
my album art, because someone 
does a drawing or something to 
your song and then you have the 
ability to reach out to them and say, 
hey, this is my song, and you drew 
a picture to it and I like it. We can 
work together. So very connected. 

TMD: 
That 
entire 
scene 

of TikTok music, of all these 
individual songs and sometimes 
artists in general just making 
huge success. I know there are 
some stylistic trends that seem 
to be more popular on TikTok. 
And it makes me think about a 
phenomenon of the mid to late 
last decade of SoundCloud and 
SoundCloud rap and that scene. 
Do you think that would be a fair 
comparison between TikTok and 
SoundCloud?

Something no one tells you 

about being an adult is that, 
at the end of the day, no one is 
going to make you do anything. 
No one is going to make you 
get a job, make you pay your 
bills, make you eat healthy or 
just generally make you get 
your life together — at least 
not in the way your parents 
made you clean your room 
when you were a kid. Sure, 
you might have friends and 
family who will be genuinely 
concerned when something 
seems to be going wrong, 
but as an adult, you’ll rarely 
ever be forced to do anything 
about it. It’s ultimately up to 
you whether you pay any mind 
to other people’s concerns 
about you. This, in a word, is 
responsibility.

Brandon 
Taylor’s 
debut 

novel “Real Life” explores 
the 
tension 
between 

responsibility 
and 
the 

psychological 
dysfunction 

resulting 
from 
childhood 

trauma. The story is told 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 

Wallace, a gay Black man 
from 
Alabama 
who 
has 

recently 
begun 
his 
PhD 

program at a predominately 
white Midwestern university. 
Though 
one 
may 
imagine 

plenty of dramatic tension 
arising from this situation 
alone, it plays a far more subtle 
role than anticipated. Broad 
social 
commentary 
takes 

a backseat to the minutiae 
of 
Wallace’s 
subjective 

experiences. 
Rarely 
does 

Wallace’s race or sexuality 
play an explicit role in his 
interactions 
with 
people, 

remaining an easily ignorable 
shadow for most of the novel, 
only 
to 
periodically 
cut 

through with a force backed 
by the entirety of America’s 
injustice against Black and 
queer people.

Conflict arises as Wallace 

attempts to navigate a number 
of delicate social situations. 
Challenging situations with 
his friends and colleagues 
force Wallace to confront 
many of his neuroses. One of 
these conflicts is with Dana, 
a new member of Wallace’s 
PhD program who he suspects 
sabotaged one of his lab 
experiments 
in 
retaliation 

for what she perceived as 
Wallace talking down to her; 
this culminates in a heated 
verbal 
argument. 
Wallace 

is an introverted, conflict-
averse 
person, 
so 
dealing 

with this situation causes him 
emotional 
stress. 
Another 

one of these tensions, which 
looms over the entire story, 
is his friends’ reactions to 
the recent death of his father. 
Taylor suggests that Wallace 
has a tumultuous relationship 
with his parents, so he doesn’t 
go to the funeral or even think 
much about the death, which 
occurred a few weeks prior 
to the events of the novel. 
Wallace tells just one of his 
friends about it, and only 
because he was somewhat 
forced to. Hours later, his 
entire friend group knows, 
but Wallace doesn’t know how 
to handle their sympathy. He 
doesn’t feel particularly sad 
about it, and doesn’t really 

know how to feel about it at 
all. So when his friends offer 
their condolences, expecting 
him to be sad, he has trouble 
reacting in a way that would 
ease their discomfort. He 
finds himself managing their 
emotions more than being 
supported by them. 

These are just a few of the 

social 
challenges 
Wallace 

faces that prompt him to 
confront 
his 
own 
inner 

conflicts. Being the focus of a 
character-driven novel, these 
inner conflicts are Taylor’s 
most captivating plot device. 
Wallace’s 
primary 
drive 

is to avoid thinking about 
the traumatic events in his 
past, particularly a sexual 
assault 
and 
the 
resultant 

poor relationship with his 
family. 
Wallace 
dodges 

these memories by focusing 
all 
his 
attention 
on 
his 

graduate work and avoiding 
situations where he needs to 
open up and feel vulnerable. 
Consequently, 
Wallace’s 

inner monologue fills most 
of the space of the book, but 
as he is thrust into various 
interpersonal conflicts, his 
efforts to isolate himself from 
others become increasingly 
fraught. Despite the lack of 
an eventful plot, the book 
doesn’t lack drama. Wallace is 
a particularly keen observer 
of both himself and the people 
around him, which makes for 
some detailed narration. We 
watch him pickup on all sorts 
of emotional subtleties while 
simultaneously blocking out 
negative 
emotions 
related 

to his past trauma. With the 

story taking place over just 
a weekend, the novel has a 
slow pace, but the incredibly 
rich 
narration 
keeps 
the 

reader engaged throughout. 
Readers who skim Wallace’s 
long 
inner 
monologues 

will 
inevitably 
miss 
an 

important 
observation, 
a 

poignant emotional moment 
or a dramatic shift in tone. 
There are few lines that feel 
superfluous, making the slow 
pacing worthwhile.

“Real Life” is a powerful 

character 
study. 
Taylor 

perceptively depicts a layered, 
complex persona in Wallace. 
The story is gut-wrenching 
and moving, giving the reader 
much to think about as they 
watch Wallace grow. “Real 
Life” is impressive in its 
own right, but even more so 
considering that it’s Taylor’s 
first novel, making me eager 
to see what else he might have 
in store.

FILM REVIEW

SMTD’s Brendan Ryan at the sideline and on the stage

Sam Smith’s ‘Love Goes’ is a new, unbalanced sound

‘The Undoing’ is the thriller we need

I’m aware that I am not alone in 

missing Michigan football — I do believe, 
however, that my specific reasoning 
for missing football is more unique 
than most others, because I do not miss 
the actual game. I barely know what a 
fourth down is, and I could not tell you 
our quarterback’s name. I also do not 
miss tailgates, or the smell of beer on 
State Street, or my brother’s inevitable 
depression whenever we lose to Ohio 
State. But I do miss the marching band 
running out of the tunnel, the voice of 
James Earl Jones on the loudspeaker 
and the flight of cheerleaders as they’re 
tossed into the air. 

Most of all, though, I miss our dance 

team. Each year, I pay for a full season 
ticket package of entrance fees so I can 
march down State Street, climb into the 
bleachers and spend all four quarters of 
every gameday watching the dancers 
spin and jump and cheer with impeccable 
precision. 

One of those dancers is Music, 

Theatre & Dance senior Brendan Ryan, 
who currently serves as a 2020-21 team 
captain. Pre-COVID-19, one could easily 
spot him by looking for the lone male on 
the sideline of female dancers — when he 
was recruited out of high school, Ryan 
became the first man to ever join a Big 10 
dance team. Superlatives aside, his spot 
on the field was well deserved: What he 
lacked in hair flips he made up for with 
dynamic facial expressions and absolute 
sass. Rain or shine, win or lose, Ryan’s 
dancing was always a joy to watch from 
the bleachers. 

“I can’t picture myself doing anything 

but performing,” Ryan recently told me 
over a FaceTime call. He phoned from 
the couch of his Ann Arbor apartment, 
backed by a massive Block M flag and 

wearing a Michigan t-shirt. His maize 
and blue pom poms hung on the wall off 
to the right. The decor was probably a 
good metaphor for the zealous dedication 
required of any successful dance team 
member. 

He and his teammates dance at every 

football and basketball game, through 
the supposed breaks of timeouts and 
halftimes. To do so, every dancer must 
memorize more than 60 sideline routines, 
each of which is assigned a codename. On 
gameday, when the band begins to play, 
the captain will yell out a code (it might 
be “Pineapple!” or maybe “Bubble!”) and 
the dancers have less than three seconds 
to begin dancing, on the beat, synced 
with the rest of their teammates. 

“We constantly get referred to as 

‘Oh, they’re just there to look pretty on 
the sidelines,” Ryan said, “and that is so 
not the case.” The system requires an 
immense amount of prep — practices start 
in early August, a month before classes 
begin, during which new members must 
learn all 60 routines. Throughout the 
year, they continue to clean each sideline, 
aiming for more precision and better 
positioning each time. Simultaneously, 
the team also learns and cleans three 
full-length routines — jazz, hip hop and 
a school-spirit-based game day program 
— for competition at the Universal 
Dance Association collegiate nationals 
in January. Their performances often 
become contenders for the top ten 
placement and this past year, they made 
the hip hop finals for the first time since 
2013. 

“We’re cheering on our sports teams 

and having a season of our own at the 
same time,” Ryan said. During the school 
year, the group works like any other sports 
team: four days of two-and-a-half hour-
long practices alongside two more days of 
cardio and strength 
training at the 

University’s athletic 
facilities. 

“The 
only 
day 
we 
have 
off 

is Saturday,” Ryan said, “but those are 
typically game days.” 

It’s a full-time, physically demanding 

gig, but 2020 marks only the ninth year 
that the University will classify its dance 
team under athletics. Ryan’s coach, 
Valerie Stead Potsos, worked diligently 
to build the team’s reputation to the point 
that they could receive funding from the 
athletics budget. “That was huge,” Ryan 
said, “She worked so hard to get us looked 
at as a sport.” 

Potsos’ fight represents a larger effort 

for dancers to be recognized as the 
physical practitioners that they are — 
to raise awareness for the athleticism 
behind the accolades, and push for more 
people to peer down from the stands 
of the Big House and cheer in awe of 
the work that goes into the precision of 
each dancer’s movements. To go for the 
football and stay for the dancing. 

But even inside the dance world, 

Ryan walks a tightrope between two 

different microcosms — he is one of six 
team members to also pursue a BFA in 
dance. “It’s two different worlds,” Ryan 
said. Athletic facilities converge with 
conventional studios that teach theory, 
history 
and 
composition. 
The 
two 

denominations do not always get along: 
“We have professors here who have 
danced all their lives and have somewhat 
of a traditional view of dance,” Ryan said, 
“and they kind of roll their eyes when 
they hear about dance team stuff.” 

As a result, Ryan and his team members 

can often find themselves contending 
with a double-edged sword. Outside the 
dance world, they defend their right to be 
viewed as a sport. Inside the dance world, 
they defend their right to be viewed as 
dance. The melee between both sides 
can be quite common for those who work 
in creative fields structured through 
competition. Where does the dancing 
stop and the sport begin? 

To Ryan, this question may not entail a 

strict line in the sand. In fact, there might 
not be a linear answer at all. After four 
years of competitive and concert dance, 
he sees himself as an embodiment of the 
back-and-forth overlap between the two. 

“Being in both worlds, I know what 

it takes, and I respect both viewpoints,” 
Ryan said. Now, as he looks to the future, 
this overlap will inform his professional 
dance career. To start, he hopes to join the 
ranks of a growing number of men in NFL 
and NBA cheer teams. “I think there’s at 
least 20 males now, nationwide,” Ryan 
said. Just a few years ago there were none. 

From there, the sky will be the limit. “I 

don’t know, backup dance for Lady Gaga 
one day?” Ryan said, or maybe Broadway. 
The open-ended career options come 
from the breadth of styles he tackled 
while here at the University. He is sports, 
art and hard work wrapped up into one.

MICHIGAN MARCHING BAND PHOTOGRAPHY

Sam Smith won the hearts of the world 

over with their 2014 album In the Lonely 
Hour. Smith has a sultry, powerful voice, 
one that can make a listener experience 
the exact emotions Smith is singing about. 
Songs like “Stay with Me,” “I’m Not the 
Only One” and “Lay Me Down” are classic 
pop ballads that remain popular six years 
later. 

From addressing their sexuality and 

gender identity to discussing body image 
issues, Smith has become a beacon of hope 
for many struggling with the same issues. 
In the five years between their first studio 
album and the release of Smith’s 2020 
album Love Goes, Smith has established 
themself as both an icon in the music 
industry as well as an outspoken public 
figure. 

Smith’s Love Goes is a well-timed album 

about the cruelty of the world around 

them. Smith actually initially planned 
for the album to be named To Die For but 
changed the title after taking the global 
pandemic into consideration. The album 
addresses heartbreak, difficult memories 
and the general pain in the world. 

Smith starts the album on a strong 

note with the acapella track “Young,” 
which gives their unbelievable vocals a 
chance to shine through without being 
overshadowed by any backing tracks. 
Smith sings wistfully about wanting to 
“Get a little wild, get a little high, kiss a 
hundred boys and not feel like I’m tied to 
them.” The song is a reflection on their 
youth and realizing that they do not 
deserve to be judged off the things they did 
as a young person in the public eye.

From this point on, unfortunately, the 

album loses its momentum. Smith tangles 
the thread, shifting from a synthy pop 
track to a slow ballad over and over again. 
There is very little consistency throughout 
the record, which is something that Smith’s 
In the Lonely Hour didn’t struggle with, 
on the other hand. It seems as if Smith is 

split between wanting to experiment with 
upbeat dance tracks and wanting to stick 
to their signature crooning vocals on top of 
piano instrumentals. While experimenting 
with new sounds is something that every 
maturing artist should feel entitled to do, 
this type of stark contrast in sounds on the 
same record ends up making the album 
feel confusing and directionless.

The strongest tracks on the record tend 

to be the ones that most closely resemble 
Smith’s first album. “Love Goes,” featuring 
Labrinth, is a catchy, slow song that shows 
off the strength of both artists’ vocals. 
“For The Lover That I Lost” is a heart-
wrenching ballad that reminisces about an 
old love. Those tracks could have easily fit 
on In the Lonely Hour, and they’re proof 
that maybe Smith’s strongest sound is the 
one they’ve been using since the beginning. 

The five bonus tracks at the end of the 

album also throw off the balance of the 
record. Three of the songs (“Dancing 
With A Stranger,” “How Do You Sleep?” 
and “I’m Ready”) are huge radio hits that 
sound over-produced. It’s clear they were 

added to the end of the album simply 
to boost its popularity, and they simply 
don’t fit into the rest of the tracks. Smith 
should have just decided to end the album 
on “Kids Again,” a simple, sweet song that 
brings the album full-circle to the idea of 
youth that Smith introduces in “Young” at 
the beginning. 

The album is clear evidence that Smith 

is continuing to change with every project 

they put out. While they have a lot of 
trial and error to go through to discover 
what sound works best for them, Smith 
is an undeniable vocal powerhouse who 
will likely continue to shine in the music 
industry for years to come.

CAPITOL

The elements that make an excellent 

psychological thriller are subjective, but “The 
Undoing,” an adaptation of the novel “You 
Should Have Known” by Jean Hanff Korelitz, 
is guaranteed to meet your expectations. 
The pilot opens with the soft, smooth jazz of 
“Dream A Little Dream of Me” and a montage 
of children innocently playing in the opening 
credits. “The Undoing” has a way of captivating 
its viewers with its strong elements of mystery 
and compelling themes. Miguel Alves (Edan 
Alexander, “Succession”), runs down the street 
in a hurry, he opens the door to a shop where 
he stands, frozen, immediately drawing the 
viewers attention with the suspense of this one 
scene. 

Grace Fraser (Nicole Kidman, “Big Little 

Lies”), a psychiatrist married to oncologist 
Jonathan Fraser (Hugh Grant, “Big Little 
Lies”), lives in a wealthy, upper-class area 
of New York. Together they raise their son, 
Henry Fraser (Noah Jupe, “A Quiet Place Part 
II”), who attends an expensive private school 
along with the children of Grace’s girlfriends. 
As a part of the school’s committee, Grace 
and her girlfriends have a meeting to plan a 
fundraiser when outsider Elena Alves (Matilda 
De Angelis, “The Big Other”) straggles in. The 
next day, Elena is found dead by her son Miguel 
in a gruesome bloodbath in her art studio. And 
Grace’s husband? Nowhere to be found. 

The episode subconsciously lures the viewer 

into the world of the one percent and compels 
them to believe that all that glitters is not really 
gold. A rich family may seem perfect on the 
outside, but there is always an ugly truth that 
lies beneath the surface. This show doesn’t 
necessarily make you want to shout “Eat the 

rich!”, but it does you reveal that people in a 
place of privilege have secrets — and they are 
capable of hiding them much better than the 
average joe. 

On the other hand, there’s a contradiction 

between Grace’s career as a couple’s psychiatrist 
and her own life, where there’s something 
obviously wrong with her marriage. To society, 
considering everything the wealthy may be 
able to acquire through their way of living, 
everything may seem perfect on the outside. 
So it makes one think, do people of higher 

statuses only pay attention to one another on 
a surface-level basis? In other words, do they 
feel the need not to be more involved with 
their partner’s lives because they’re blinded by 
wealth and money? Could Jonathan be involved 
in an affair with Elena? It’s odd that Elena was 
instantly drawn to Grace as if she had some sort 
of unknown connection towards her. However, 
it’s too soon to make final conclusions on such 
a situation. 

Additionally, the music in this episode was 

the perfect vehicle for the tone. Throughout 
the episode, there were constant scores 
of 
ominous, 
orchestral 
music, 
working 

wonderfully to prepare the viewer for a sudden 
event. It helped push the show into its narrative 
of suspense. All the actors and actresses were 
dedicated to their roles and portrayed their 
characters 
exceptionally 
well. 
However, 

the cinematography was bland. For certain 
scenes that were meant to illustrate a dark and 
foreboding tone, the lighting stayed consistent 
and did little to help set the scene. 

For those who have a love for suspense and 

thrillers, “The Undoing” is the perfect match. 
With its appealing way of drawing the viewer 
in throughout the entirety of the episode, 
it’s bound to keep your attention and leave 
you wanting more. The commentary on the 
underlying issues within the upper class only 
adds to the mystery and makes it all the more 
ominous.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“extremely online” to my friends, 
they usually agree — they too 
love memes and spend hours on 
Twitter.

gets messy. It usually turns into 
some form of me reciting my own 
version of Bane’s quote from “The 
Dark Knight Rises”: “You merely 
adopted the internet; I was born in 
it, molded by it.”

To say that the musical career 

of Daniel Lopatin (aka Chuck 
Persons aka Kaoss Edge aka 
Oneohtrix Point Never aka OPN) 
is complex, well, is a bit of an 
understatement. 
Though 
each 

moniker comes corresponds to a 
distinct style, Lopatin’s work is 
deeply entrenched in mythos — 
his projects connect in a way that 
creates a canon. Naturally, some of 
this lore comes from fan discourse, 
but a large majority of it feels 
intentionally crafted by Lopatin 
himself. Particularly as Oneohtrix 
Point Never, every project of his 
provides some new way to view his 
artistry. He is fixated on how aura 
and feeling manifest themselves 
within sounds, a fixation which 
has led him to craft some of the 
most experimental and innovative 
pieces of the last decade.

Because of how truly alien 

so much of his music sounds, 
one might think of him as the 
type of avant-garde that deep-
cut historians who spend most 
of their time in record stores or 
rateyourmusic forums would brag 
about 
“discovering.” 
However, 

despite all signs pointing toward 
maintaining a career outside 
the 
establishment, 
OPN’s 

trajectory has put him not only 
at the vanguard of experimental 
electronic music, but as a frequent 
mingler with the mainstream. 
Within the last few years, he has 
been able to catch the attention 
of and collaborate with many 
well-known 
artists, 
including 

FKA Twigs and The Weeknd, 

as well as soundtrack several 
movies, including “Good Time” 
and “Uncut Gems.” Perhaps the 
greatest testament to the quality 
of his music is that these artists 
don’t want to work with him 
because of his accessibility (OPN 
is many things, but accessible is 
not one of them), but because his 
artistic intention remains clear. 
They want to collaborate with him 
despite the challenging nature 
of his work and the chaos of his 
vision.

A question that many had was 

how this explosion of exposure 
would affect his music. Would 
he try to incorporate a more 
accessible structure to his sound, 
or would he further embrace the 
unpredictable aesthetic he has 
built for himself? Magic Oneohtrix 
Point Never provides the answer: 
both.

In his last album Age Of, there 

were slight signs of a change in 
methodology. Chiefly, it used 
Lopatin’s voice as a tool. The fact 
that there was actual singing 
going on created the perception 
that the music was taking on a 
more traditional format, but on 
closer inspection, the singing 
was actually used as a way to 
discover new ways of displaying 
unconventionality. With Magic, 
he appears to explore his own 
voice even further, flirting closer 
and closer with traditional song 
structure. 
This 
traditionality 

also shows up in the various 
collaborations across the album, 
including 
features 
from 
The 

Weeknd, 
Caroline 
Polachek, 

Arca 
and 
NOLANBEROLLIN. 

However, this is only one aspect 
of the album. Almost as if it’s 

in response, the other half of 
the album contains some of 
OPN’s most experimental and 
aesthetically complex music to 
date. The way the experimental 
pieces are arranged in the album 
can make it seem like they are 
the “filler” that take up the space 
between the more songish tracks, 
and yet they somehow contain a 
plethora of ideas and feelings. As 
an artist, Lopatin might be one of 
the best at unveiling meaning from 
within that which seems vacant. 

If there is one thing that has 

remained constant throughout 
OPN’s career, it is Lopatin’s 
obsession with the potency of 
memory. Often this sense of 
memory may seem strange, even 
alien, but never unfamiliar. Magic 
presents itself as the summation of 
the discoveries he’s made through 
his exploration of the topic. In 
many ways, it feels like this is the 
first time Lopatin has looked back. 
There are so many callbacks to his 
prior works (the plunderphonics of 
Replica, the incongruity of R Plus 
7, the nostalgic angst of Garden 
of Delete), and they all function 
as a self-reflection and also an 
obituary. The chopped up radio 
interludes really bring this point 
home. In them, you hear the voices 
of announcers speaking in pseudo-
Lynchian dialogue, there’ll only be 
a memory of music and this dream 
is the sound. And this dream will 
self-destruct in 3 … 2 … Everything 
fades and gets replaced eventually, 
memory, dreams and, as Lopatin is 
trying to establish, so too will his 
music.

Serendipity, storytelling at 
AA’s West Side Book Shop

For Jay Platt, bookselling 

has always been about stories 
and 
serendipity. 
Celebrating 

its 45th year on September 21, 
his store West Side Book Shop 
opened at 113 W Liberty Street 
in Ann Arbor in 1975, a few 
years after Platt graduated from 
the University with a degree in 
naval engineering.

Last week, Platt sat relaxed 

in a leather swivel chair, sipping 
water out of a small styrofoam 
cup as he described how this 
store began with just a few 
bookshelves, pointing out the 
rows and stacks of scattered 
books.

Though 
originally 
from 

Virginia, Platt stayed in Ann 
Arbor after graduation to be 
amid the political fervor of the 
late 1960s.

“It was a pretty crazy time,” 

Platt said. “I didn’t really 
know what I was wanting 
to do. I didn’t want to be in 
engineering, to be behind a 
desk all the time. And so I got 
into books. I feel very lucky that 
I found something I really like 
to do.”

Around 1970, while still in 

college, a friend of Platt’s took 
him into a bookshop in New 
York City — Booksellers’ Row 
on Fourth Avenue. 

Surrounded by the towering 

shelves of used and rare books, 
Platt got “bitten by the bug.” 
The mysteries and histories 
hidden within those old covers 
drew him in.

Platt is also fascinated by far-

off travel, and this is reflected 
in the West Side Bookshop’s 
collection — especially polar 
explorations. Platt asked me 
if I knew anything about the 
history of the Antarctic. When 
I said no, he sat up to tell me a 
story. 

“Relatively 
early 
19th 

century, no one even knew the 
Antarctic existed. No one had 
even cited it until the 1820s,” 
Platt explained. He cited books 
by Ernest Shackleton, one of the 
most famous explorers from 
the “Heroic Age of Antarctic 
Exploration” — the book of 
the same name is one of Platt’s 
favorites. His eyes lit up while 
recounting 
Shackleton’s 

expedition, 
barely 
stopping 

for a breath at the Endurance’s 
(Shackleton’s ship) peril on the 
ice. 

“He (Shackleton) made that 

decision to do it and not take 
the glory. He’d rather save his 
men. Anyway, later on, the pole 
had been reached by a couple of 
explorers. Shackleton wanted to 
be the first across the Antarctic 
continent. 
The 
Endurance 

got stuck in the ice and was 
crushed ... And long story short, 
he saved those men. Nope, not 
one life was lost. It was just an 

incredible story ... It probably 
got me started,” Platt said. 

The West Side Book Shop 

also has a sizable collection of 
children’s books, literary first 
editions and books on Michigan 
state history. 

“That’s one thing about the 

book trade. You have to have 
curiosity. You have to know a 
little bit about everything. And 
you’re always learning because 
there’s always something new,” 
Platt said. 

Building a collection of over 

20,000 books has kept Platt 
busy for the last 45 years. When 
I asked him if he keeps an 
inventory of all these books, he 
simply tapped his forehead. He 
remembers it all without notes. 

Platt acquires many of these 

books from people who are 
moving or acquaintances of 
someone 
who 
has 
recently 

died. He also attends book 
fairs all across the country. 
During non-pandemic life, the 
events take him to Chicago, 
Minneapolis, 
Washington, 

Boston, San Francisco, Los 
Angeles, 
St. 
Petersburg, 

Floridam and Austin, Texas. 
There is also usually a book fair 
at the ballroom of the Michigan 
Union. 

“Every now and then you 

find your little gem. I mean, it 
kind of keeps you going,” Platt 
said. One of his favorite finds 
was from five years ago when 
someone from the western side 

of the state brought in a book 
published in 1498. Any book 
published before 1501 is called 
incunabula, Platt explained — 
the word comes from the Latin 
for “swaddling clothes.” This 
was one of those gems. 

Part 
of 
the 
West 
Side 

Book Shop’s history is in the 
building itself. Built in 1888 
in 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
originally 

German 
neighborhood, 
the 

former owners, the Haarrars, 
sold German newspapers and 
carried German school books. 
They also had a photography 
studio in the back. Now, thanks 
to the passion and expertise 
of Doug Price, the back room 
retains its photographic roots, 
but as a gallery of vintage 
photography. 

“I started buying and selling 

vintage photographs from say 
1840, up to about 1930. So that’s 

really the bulk of my business,” 
Price said. One of his favorites 
is a photograph of the 1908 
International 
Brotherhood 

of Teamsters convention in 
Detroit. The panoramic shot 
includes all the attendees in 
front of the Grand Army of the 
Republic building. 

“Photographs 
like 
this 

contain 
a 
great 
number 

of 
stories. 
They’re 
like 

anthologies, they’re like novels, 
there’s texture. There’s human 
complexity, there’s ambiguity, 
there’s both subordinate and 
dominant points of fact in 
the 
photograph. 
That’s 
all 

interesting to me,” Price said.

Unfortunately, 
like 
all 

businesses 
threatened 
by 

COVID-19, the West Side Book 
Shop fell on tougher times this 
year. The bookstore was closed 
for three months, from March to 

mid-June. In April, Platt’s wife 
set up a GoFundMe. Luckily, 
on top of the online donations, 
a stranger dropped off a $2,000 
check a few days ago. 

“It worked out pretty well,” 

Platt said. “A lot of people come 
in and say how much they love 
it. There’s nothing like this. I’m 
proud of this. Just the fact that 
I try to carry good books, you 
know, I mean, hopefully pretty 
well chosen.” 

With 
the 
afternoon 

light 
filtering 
in 
through 

the windows and onto the 
photographs, the room feels 
steeped in history. When I 
commented on how I enjoyed 
the disarray and homey feeling 
of the store, Platt said, “It adds 
to the serendipity — discovering 
something.”

2020’s ‘Rebecca’ is the 
wrong kind of haunted

Around this time of year, we 

become invested in ghost stories. 
Stories of haunted houses and 
paranormal 
activity 
fill 
the 

screens as people deliberately 
scare 
themselves. 
But 
there 

are different kinds of haunting 
beyond 
vengeful 
spirits 
— 

hauntings by past actions, by 
decisions, by expectations. And, 
in the case of “Rebecca,” being 
haunted by those who came 
before.

Based on the 1938 novel by 

Daphne du Maurier and the 1940 
Hitchcock film that followed, this 
2020 “Rebecca” has many shades 
of the original. The film is set in 
the same time period, giving it a 
subtle period piece feel, and the 
plot as a whole remains nearly 
identical: a young woman (Lily 
James, “Baby Driver”) meets 
and marries Maxim de Winter 
(Armie Hammer, “Call Me by 
Your Name”), a wealthy widower, 
but finds herself struggling to 
overcome the shadow of his 
deceased wife, Rebecca.

The young woman is never 

given a first name, referred to 
only as “Mrs. de Winter” after 
her marriage to Maxim — the 
only name that is important, it 
seems, is Rebecca. Rebecca’s face 
is never seen, but her presence 
is 
everywhere 
at 
Manderley 

— everything the new Mrs. de 
Winter sees, from the unopened 
mail to the items emblazoned 
with a signature “R,” seems to 
belong to Rebecca. Mrs. Danvers 
(Kristin Scott Thomas, “Only God 

Forgives”), the housekeeper and 
former confidant of Rebecca de 
Winter, has a sinister vendetta 
against the new lady of the house: 
She ominously lurks in corners, 
sabotages 
Mrs. 
de 
Winter’s 

attempts to try new things in the 
house and continuously tells her 
how special and revered Rebecca 
was. Between the emotional 
ghosts 
and 
psychological 

grudges, Mrs. de Winter feels like 
an imposter in her own home.

The 
film 
is 
undoubtedly 

stunning: The gorgeous shots 
of gardens in Italy and cliffs 
in 
England, 
combined 
with 

the 
delightful 
1930s-inspired 

clothing, create a vibrant color 
palette that jumps off the screen. 
Creative directing and editing 
create an effect of fluidity in 
memories and dreams — flashes 
of moments make their way into 
the story, but it’s occasionally 
unclear if they are images of what 
is to come or images of a past that 
the unnamed protagonist did not 
see. Yet the film still falters. In 
general, there’s some solid acting 
from James and Hammer — and, 
pleasantly, 
Hammer’s 
British 

accent isn’t atrocious, which is 
more than I can say for some 
American actors — but little to no 
substance in any of the characters.

The 
portrayals 
of 
women 

are particularly disappointing. 
Mrs. Danvers is so one-track 
minded that she becomes one 
dimensional. Mrs. de Winter is 
the cliché kind of unique — she’s 
an orphan who knows about cars 
and reads lots of books, which 
of course is surprising because 
what woman would ever read or 
know about cars? But despite her 

intelligence and capability she 
is always at the mercy of others. 
And Rebecca, despite her looming 
presence, is little more than an 
idea.

The biggest issue, however, 

is the manifestation of the plot. 
While some imagery finds a 
strong foothold in the story, 
there are moments that feel like 
important 
foreshadowing 
but 

end up being meaningless. The 
rising tension doesn’t quite reach 
a point that makes sense; because 
of this, the climax feels hollow 
and undeserved in context. At one 
point, as more details are revealed, 
the story shifts so abruptly that 
it feels almost like two separate 
films, one right after the other. 
Even the ending feels a little off, 
like the moral of the story doesn’t 
match the story itself.

The question that remains is 

why — why recreate the award-
winning Hitchcock adaptation 
of “Rebecca” from 1940? Though 
I haven’t seen the original, it 
seems odd to do a remake without 
adding 
anything 
particularly 

new 
or 
interesting. 
Instead, 

this “Rebecca” is a film, soaked 
in an exorbitant amount of 
dramatic rain, that isn’t much 
more than two attractive leads 
in an exquisite house dealing 
with psychological gothic horror 
and/or maybe solving a murder 
mystery (depending on which 
half of the film you’re watching). 
One can’t help but think that, 
like Mrs. de Winter, “Rebecca” 
is also haunted — haunted by the 
superiority of what came before.

‘Magic’ adds yet another 
feather to Lopatin’s cap

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
14 — Wednesday, November 11, 2020 
statement

I

n the course of an undergraduate 
education here at the University of 
Michigan, there are just some things 

one is bound to encounter at some point or 
another. The Big House, the Shapiro Under-
graduate Library, the block ‘M’; not to men-
tion Zingerman’s, Hatcher Graduate Library 
and Angell Hall; these are the perennial 
names, spaces and places that make the U-
experience what it is today.

If we look a little closer, however, there is 

another figure that tends to receive a consid-
erable amount of attention here as well: His 
name is Karl Marx.

Marx was one of the most influential 

thinkers of the 19th century and one of the 
most important critics of the economic sys-
tem of capitalism. At the center of the Marx-
ian critique is the inverse relationship be-
tween the accumulation of capital and the 
misery of the working class, a critique that 
seems to have no less credence today than it 
did in Marx’s time. However, to reduce his 
impact to this particular effort would be a 
mistake. More than an ideological founder of 
communism, Marx’s writings touched prac-
tically every corner of social life. 

During the University’s fall 2020 semester 

alone, courses in fields as diverse as cultural 
anthropology, classical civilization, French, 
German, political science, sociology, women 
and gender studies, and philosophy mention 
Marx in the description of advanced junior 
and senior-level courses. Any student major-
ing in these fields, as well as someone taking 
a course in these fields to meet requirements 
or for persona; curiosity, would be hard-
pressed to avoid Marx or exploring Marxist 
thought in an academic setting.

In one sense, being exposed to radical 

new ideas, such as those presented by Marx, 
is just part of a “liberal” education; one in 
which, while studying a given subject, stu-
dents also acquire critical thinking skills 
they can apply in a broad range of situations. 
Michigan students, so says the mission of 
the University, are expected to “challenge 
the present and enrich the future.” The LSA 
website propounds a similar belief about the 
task of thinking: “thinking doesn’t have to 
be elegant — it can be messy, it can shake up 
the status quo and it can set minds in motion. 
Evolution, after all, is rarely neat.” 

Both the materialist notion of setting 

minds in motion and the call for students to 
“challenge” or “shake up” the preconceived 
ideas of their time express a commitment to 
social change of which Marx would have ap-
proved. I can only wonder whether the au-
thor of these words had next to them a copy 
of Marx’s “Theses on Feuerbach,” originally 
written in the spring of 1845. In the “The-
ses,” Marx expressed his own frustrations 
with academic pursuits that lacked practi-
cal application, writing that “philosophers 
have only interpreted the world, in various 
ways; the point, however, is to change it.”

Let me not overstate my point, however. 

Marx is a controversial figure, and there is 
not a general acceptance of Marxist thought 
or practice in any academic institution. 
What is undeniable is the scope of his im-
pact on the minds of the world in general, 
and the minds at the University in particu-
lar.S

o, what is the impact of Marxism 
on the University? As with any ide-
ology or body of intellectual contri-

butions, the tangible effects are difficult to 
measure.

Nevertheless, there seems to be a conser-

vative hypothesis that neo-Marxism runs 
rampant on college campuses across the 
United States, with harmful consequences. 
For example, a Fox News article laments the 
“lopsidedness of the social sciences,” refer-
ring to the high proportion of faculty who 
self-identify as Marxists, leftists, or simply, 
Democrats compared with conservatives. 
Similar articles repeat the refrain that now-
defunct 20th century economic Marxism 
mutated into the cultural and literary theo-
ries of postmodernism, which they argue, are 
too often obsessed with identity politics and 
privilege. Riffing off a New York Times ar-
ticle on the mainstreaming of Marxist ideol-

ogy, the Foundation for Economic Education 
accused Marxist ideas of fleeing to “English 
departments and other more abstract disci-
plines,” while still exercising a detrimental 
effect on the good sense of university gradu-
ates.

I think these and other accusations of 

Marxist indoctrination fundamentally miss 
the mark. Liberal arts colleges are not like 
churches; they do not preach a singular, 
unified gospel that worshippers are then 
expected to spread far and wide. While it is 
true that universities in the U.S. lean left, in 
my experience, professors have no interest 
in indoctrinating their students. Particularly 
in the humanities, it is hard to survive if you 
never question the intellectual authorities.

For example, in my phone conversation 

with Rackham student Deven Philbrick, he 
explained how his teaching was political in 
nature, but not in the normal sense of the 
word.

“In terms of who people vote for, what 

governments are in power, who is in those 
governments, things like that … nothing that 
I have in my teaching is very interested in 
those problems,” Philbrick said. “Although, 
certainly, I do teach sort of critical think-
ing skills that could then be applied to such 
problems, but that’s not what I’m asking stu-
dents to do in my classes.” 

What, then, is expected of students in 

Philbrick’s courses? Part of the answer lies 
in the intellectual legacy of Marxism. When 
I asked Philbrick if he had drawn any par-
ticular ideas from his reading of Marx, he 
explained that the most important idea Marx 
instilled in his subsequent attitude was the 
need to “engage in ruthless criticism of all 
that exists.”

“In my teaching, I try to show my students 

that one of our tasks is to criticize in this aca-
demic sense of picking something apart, but 
that we want to do that to everything,” Phil-
brick said. “That is, to think radically, in the 
strict technical sense of radical; to get to the 
root of the things that we’re talking about.”

The idea of “ruthless criticism of all that 

exists” comes from Marx’s 1843 letter to the 
German philosopher Arnold Ruge, in which 
he commends his countryman for leaving the 

stifling atmosphere of Germany for the rela-
tive freedom of Paris. In the letter, he argues 
that any improvement in the condition of 
mankind requires an inquiry of critical un-
derstanding into the prevailing conditions, 
an inquiry that the government in Germany 
allegedly suppressed. He writes that, in con-
trast, “we do not dogmatically anticipate the 
world, but only want to find the new world 
through criticism of the old one.”

Philbrick’s use of the word, “radical” rein-

forces the pedagogical goal of ruthless criti-
cism. “Radical” comes from the latin radix, 
meaning “root.” To get to the root of some-
thing is certainly a laudable goal, an “end” in 
the sense that after that you can go no fur-
ther after achieving the root. Today, however, 
there is a stigma attached in the U.S. to radi-
calism and radical political movements. The 
criticism emanates from the right and center 
of the political spectrum, seeking to ideologi-
cally separate the so-called radical from the 
mainstream. However, the poetic meaning of 
this word should give us pause; is it not the 
goal of any problem-solver to get to the root 
of their problem? And would society not be 
improved if more people thought critically, 
or “radically” in this way?
S

o, if there is a fundamental shared 
intellectual goal between Marxism 
and the University, it is to engage 

in “ruthless criticism of all that exists,” or, in 
the slightly watered-down version, to “chal-
lenge the present and enrich the future.”

However, in drawing a comparison be-

tween these two general practical commit-
ments, it is not my intention to hide the more 
“hardcore” versions of Marxism that exist on 
our campus.

While the University as an institution 

does not explicitly endorse any political affil-
iations, there is no shortage of students, fac-
ulty or organizations that support the con-
tinued study of Marx and different aspects of 
Marxist thought.

In fact, a Michigan student who is curi-

ous about Marxism would probably do well 
to start asking their peers; some of them al-
ready hold a lot of knowledge on the subject.

I talked over the phone with LSA sopho-

more Garret Ashlock, who started reading 

Marx while in high school. He explained 
how Marx was the first thinker with whom 
he seriously engaged, opening his eyes to 
brand new ideas and ways of thinking.

“Especially for a period there, I tried to 

read all the Marx that I could,” Ashlock said. 
“That included, of course, ‘The Communist 
Manifesto,’ but also ‘Capital,’ the ‘Grun-
drisse,’ ‘The German Ideology,’ even a lot of 
his earlier texts I was very much interested 
in.”

Though the University consistently of-

fers courses related to Marx, Ashlock has 
conducted much of this intellectual explora-
tion outside of school. The sheer volume of 
Marx’s writings requires this level of self-
study, especially if Marxist ideas constitute 
only part of the syllabus, as is the case in most 
courses. That being said, Ashlock also touted 
the social aspect of reading Marx along with 
an interested group of peers.

“I certainly have a lot of people that I talk 

to about Marxism,” Ashlock explained. “You 
know, certain circles or social groups where 
we’ll read secondary texts and share com-
ments on them.”

Ashlock admitted that a lot of the con-

temporary conversation on Marx errs more 
on the side of literary and cultural theory, 
though he disputed the claim that Marx’s 
critique of capitalism had been vanquished 
with the fall of the Soviet Union. There are, 
he argued, some notable Marxist political 
economists out there today, and plenty of 
reasons to study Marxist economics in the 
21st century.

To learn more about this, I spoke with 

Rackham student Alejo Stark, coordinator 
of the Marxisms collective at the University. 
The collective, composed mostly of graduate 
students and professors, was formed in 2011 
in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis. 
With the collapse of the global economy due 
to intertwined speculative bubbles in hous-
ing and banking, many University students 
turned to Marx as an explicitly political and 
economic thinker.

Ann Arbor

W

hen I first 
a r r i v e d 
to 
cam-

pus as a freshman, I was 
brimming with a sense 
of 
conflicting 
excite-

ment and agitation. As 
an international student 
from Canada, most of my 
knowledge of the Ameri-
can college experience 
came from “Pitch Per-
fect” and online forums 
like Reddit and College 
Confidential. 
While 
I 

was looking forward to 
making friends and so-
cializing, I also carried 
with me a little anxiety 
about where I would fit 
in. Football was never 
a part of my life before 
college and the thought 
of living alone away from 
home scared me. Luck-
ily, after a semester of 
exploring Ann Arbor res-
taurants and bonding, I 
found a group of people I 
love and made memories 
that I could cherish for a 
lifetime. It seemed all of 
my preoccupations dissi-
pated into worries I once 
knew.

However, the class of 

2024 may not be as lucky 
as I was. To contain the 
spread 
of 
COVID-19, 

most University social spaces and facili-
ties were closed, drastically reducing op-
portunities for freshmen to form their 
own communities. Students can no longer 
meet for lunch in South Quad dining hall, 
or study for classes together in the Shap-
iro Undergraduate Library. Consequently, 
some parents began to petition for the 
University to reopen dining halls and im-
plement further in-person instruction to 
improve the University’s students’ mental 
well-being. As someone who deeply sym-
pathizes with the freshmen’s situations, I 
reached out to a few of these parents and 
invited them to share their stories.

Nanci Bramson, the mother of an LSA 

freshman, expressed her concerns to me 
about the aforementioned challenges ex-
actly. She explained that the lack of COV-
ID-catered social spaces or programming 
in such isolating times is problematic for 
students trying to make their way.

“(The University is) not giving any op-

portunities to these 18- and 19-year-olds 
to socialize, and instead they are just pe-
nalizing them,” Bramson complained. 
“And the only ways they can socialize are 
absolutely dangerous.”

She reprimanded the University for 

not treating students as human beings 
with social needs and the lack of avail-
able socially-distanced programs such as 
book clubs, study groups and game nights. 
Bramson pointed to another large public 
university, the University of Pittsburgh, 
which has established shelter pods within 
residences to help students better transi-
tion into campus communities in a public 
health-informed manner.

“The University is really failing them. 

It’s just taking their money for nothing,” 
Bramson said. “There could’ve been social 
opportunities. (The University) should’ve 
engaged their RAs more, help(ing) them 
create relationships with the kids.”

And while Bramson acknowledges the 

lack of support residential staff received 
from the University in the beginning of 
the school year, she also laments their 
lack of involvement in freshmen’s tran-
sition. Indeed, in early September, more 
than 100 residential advisers went on 

strike, demanding increased COVID-19 
safety measures and accessible testing. As 
a result, most RAs were not able to pro-
vide students with guidance during the 
time when many new students needed it 
the most. According to Bramson, both of 
her daughter’s two RAs quit: one within 
the first week of school and one at the be-
ginning of the stay-in-place order. The ab-
sence of RAs and lack of community-wide 
engagement has created another barrier 
for freshmen to socialize safely. 

Robert Liu, the father of another LSA 

freshman, also shared the stories of his 
daughter’s social difficulties. While he un-
derstands the University’s preference for 
online modes of instruction, he considers 
in-person interactions and public dining 
spaces crucial to the college experience. 
He told me that he thinks the University 
is doing a satisfying job in containing the 
virus, and feels hopeful about the reopen-
ing of dining halls in the future. But Liu is 
afraid that since the class of 2024 are the 
first generation of people born after 9/11, 
these students may be more susceptible to 
mental health issues.

“I was just hoping that nobody looks 

down upon this freshmen class as snow-
flakes or over-sensitive people,” Liu ex-
plained. “Any mental health issue is jus-
tifiable.”

However, while parents like Bramson 

believed that the administration had com-
pletely failed its students in both physical 
and mental health, Neil Cadman is appre-
ciative of the University’s caution. Cad-
man, whose daughter is a freshman living 
in East Quad Residence Hall, told me that 
his daughter has had an amazing experi-
ence in dorms. Though Cadman’s daugh-
ter has rarely interacted with her RA, she 
was able to form a small group of close 
friends in her marching band via Zoom 
over the summer, and maintained these 
relationships throughout the semester.

“I know that there are so many kids 

who are having such difficult social is-
sues, but our daughter has really accli-
mated through the band and (from) hav-
ing a roommate she really likes,” Cadman 
explained. “The stars really fell into align-
ment for her.”

Cadman stated that one of the rea-

sons why he felt comfortable sending his 
daughter to campus was because of Uni-
versity President Mark Schlissel’s back-
ground in immunology. Cadman had faith 
in an administration that understands and 
makes its decisions based on science. 

“When my daughter moved to the dorm, 

we essentially signed an agreement with the 
University,” Cadman explained. “(Schlis-
sel’s medical background) was part of our 
reasons for feeling comfortable sending her. 
(The fact) that the leader of the university 
was a medical doctor, and that he under-
stood that science has to run this.”

Yet he also acknowledged that perhaps 

because his own daughter is doing better 
mentally than the majority of freshmen, 
he appreciated the University for placing 
safety of the community as a first priority. 
Indeed, though the University has exercised 
a certain degree of caution in its fall reopen-
ing plan, bringing students back on campus 
has also drastically increased the population 
density in Ann Arbor. Along with the start of 
the flu season and escalating student gath-
erings, test positivity rate in Washtenaw 
County has surged from 1.7 percent on Aug. 
28 to 4.1 percent on Nov. 5. 

“The difference in going to a place like 

Michigan is in those things that you can’t 
measure,” Cadman stated. “I feel horrible, 
but not enough to make the universities 
all go back though, and put everybody at 
risk!”

Since most of them view the Univer-

sity’s situation from a distance, each par-
ent shared a different perspective on the 
policies. However, as a student who’s ex-
periencing a hybrid semester firsthand in 
Ann Arbor, I share a mix of their concerns. 
While it is certainly difficult to maintain a 
good balance between mental health and 
physical safety, I think the University has 
failed us in both. 

Ever since mid-September, I have re-

ceived 17 notifications of positive cases 
in East Quad, where each notification in-
dicated one or more cases. I see students 
who eat in indoor lounges without social 
distancing, mainly because they have no-
where else to go. I know people who sus-
pected symptoms but did not get tested 

because they did not 
want to be isolated 
in a facility that has 
roaches and hallways 
crowded by trash. Cre-
ating a safe space for 
students to study and 
socialize is the foun-
dation of our mental 
health, and because of 
the University’s vague 
and 
inconsiderate 

policies, the admin-
istration has lost the 
students’ trust since 
the first month of the 
semester.

But just like what 

Bramson, 
Cadman 

and Liu believe, this 
doesn’t 
mean 
we 

should not hope for 
better or make our 
voices heard. 

On Friday morning, 

when I took a break 
from monitoring the 
election 
and 
typing 

this piece, I received 
an email from Schlis-
sel regarding the Uni-
versity’s winter 2021 
plan. Though I appre-
ciated the University 
for listening to student 
concerns and enhanc-
ing safety measures, 
the updated housing 
terms, which included 

limited residence and canceling of win-
ter contracts, caught me off guard. As a 
result, I quickly followed up with the in-
terviewed parents again to see if their im-
mediate reactions changed their perspec-
tives. Liu told me that her daughter was 
greatly upset by the news and concerned 
about her work-study position.

“I feel for my daughter, her friends and 

everybody at the (University of Michigan) 
community,” he said. “I told her that the 
University is trying to look after every-
body’s health, and (my daughter said that) 
she cares more about her mental health.”

On the other hand, Bramson was scram-

bling to get her hands on available off-
campus housing options for the upcom-
ing semester. Cadman also expressed his 
concern about the potential deterioration 
of his daughter’s mental health at home. 
However, he completely respects the Uni-
versity’s policies and puts his daughter’s 
decision first.

“I actually feel worse for the class 

of 2021, because those seniors are go-
ing through what the class of 2024 went 
through in high school last year. And I 
know how hard that is,” Cadman lament-
ed. “At least my daughter has maybe three 
years of normal college.”

The University’s cautious winter plan 

may put us back on track to return to nor-
mal for fall 2021, but parents’ concerns 
of students’ exacerbated mental health 
are not baseless. Just recently, a student 
at Grace College in Indiana passed away 
alone in her dorm room, with COVID-19 
being one of the contributing factors 
to her death. In the most recent winter 
2021 plan, the University has merely in-
troduced two academic “well-being day” 
breaks and an expansion of Counseling 
and Psychological Services team to sup-
port student mental health. Though such 
passive initiatives can relieve students’ 
stress and depressive feelings, they do not 
actively address the source of these men-
tal health difficulties: isolation. While the 
faster things return to normal the better 
our college experience will be, the Uni-
versity must recognize the existing issues 
at hand and resolve them individually.

T

his week, I was on a Zoom call 
listening to one of my professors 
drone on about Sinclair Lewis, 

when I realized that every single professor I 
have this semester is a white man.

The realization wasn’t totally abrupt — it 

crossed my mind before. Last semester, I re-
member thinking that it seemed dispropor-
tionate how many white professors I had, 
but it was never an issue I’d spent much 
time investigating. This week, after hearing 
my white, male professor talk about how a 
white man author was “kind of racist, but 
still worth reading,” I got fed up and decided 
to look at the statistics.

I started with my classes from this semes-

ter. I went down the list. History, yes. Eng-
lish, yes. Philosophy, yes. Creative writing, 
yes. The only instructor of color I have this 
semester is the discussion leader for my his-
tory class, and I have no female instructors. 
Last semester was the same: white male pro-
fessors only.

Then I busted out my records — screen-

shots of old class schedules, Canvas archives 
— and realized that in almost four years at 
the University of Michigan, I’ve had only 
three professors who weren’t white men: 
Two were white women, one was an Asian 
man. In my major courses, every single one 
of my professors was a white man. I’ve never 
taken a single class with a professor who was 
a woman of color, or with any professor of an 
underrepresented minority.

Maybe this shouldn’t have been a surprise 

to me: academia is, and always has been, 
dominated by white men. This disparity can 
be worse in some fields than others. For ex-
ample, disciplines like women’s studies and 
sociology tend to have better representation 
of women than fields like mathematics or 
physics, which are particularly gender-strat-
ified. My own major, philosophy, is one such 
subject area. 

Of course, many universities, including 

the University, are aware of this disparity. 
But even when efforts are made to fix the di-
versity gap, changes often come at the level 
of lower faculty, diversifying non-professor-
ship before professor appointments and ad-
junct positions before tenure or tenure-track 
jobs. For example, the front page of the Uni-
versity’s diversity statistics touts a faculty 
and staff composed of 44% women and 26% 
ethnic minorities, numbers at least some-
what close to representative of the U.S.’s gen-
eral population (which is composed of 51% 
women and 40% ethnic minorities). 

But the numbers for diversity among pro-

fessors lags behind faculty and staff diver-
sity as a whole. An in-depth report in 2019 
showed 73% of all professors are men, and 
though 23% are racial or ethnic minorities, 
only around 8% belong to underrepresented 
minorities, a crucial distinction to make. The 
term “racial or ethnic minorities” generally 
refers to people belonging to racial or ethnic 
groups which are not the majority group in 

their societies — in the U.S., this means non-
white groups. However, underrepresented 
minorities refers to people who are dispro-
portionately excluded from a setting or field 
— in this case, academia. At the University, 
that includes people who identify as Black or 
Hispanic/Latinx, Native Americans and Na-
tive Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders — groups 
which collectively compose a full third of 
the U.S.’s population. Another University site 
said 49% of the University’s tenure-track fac-
ulty are white men as of 2018.

This may be, in part, due to the built-in 

delays in the tenure system which prevent 
older professors from being replaced. Once 
a professor receives tenure, it’s very difficult 
to fire them. More and more professors are 
working past the standard retirement age, re-
sulting in an aging workforce that, due to his-
toric disparities in hiring, remains primarily 
composed of white men.

But regardless of the reasons behind it, it’s 

still a problem. Firstly, a lack of representation 
in higher education can be discouraging for 
minority students and female students. When 
diverse students don’t see themselves reflect-
ed in their teachers, they can feel dissuaded 
from pursuing a particular field of study or 
pursuing post-graduate education. They can 
also often struggle to connect with profes-
sors. Young women and people of color may 
feel less comfortable speaking to older white 
men than their white peers. This can become 
a barrier to education, but it can also limit 
networking opportunities or the growth of 
mentor-mentee relationships, which can lead 
to letters of recommendation down the line.

LSA junior Sophia Raines, an African 

American woman, described this phenom-
enon in a phone interview.

“It takes me a while to feel more comfort-

able with (white male professors) than I think 
it would if I were a white person,” she said. 
“I’m in a lot of writing classes, and when I 
write my script, I think they definitely tend 
to be more (written from) my perspective as 
a Black woman and my identity, and so I usu-
ally am very wary of what the professors have 
to say and kind of more on guard with them.”

There’s also the issue of content. White 

male professors may be less likely to teach 
material from or about women and people 
of color. Take, for instance, an English class 
I’m enrolled in this semester. Taught by a 
white man, the syllabus includes 13 authors 
that we’ll read in depth. Of those 13 authors, 
nine are white men, three are white women 
and only a single author is a man of color. Re-
search has shown that white male professors 
are less likely than their diverse peers to as-
sign readings by diverse authors. Even when 
professors try to diversify their syllabuses, 
it’s often with one of a few oft-cited women 
or minority voices. It will probably come as 
no shock that the single author of color in 
my English class is William Carlos Williams 
— a very popular author whose work is often 
taught in both high school and college.

There’s also the fact that white men teach 

content differently than women and people 
of color — they teach from a white man’s 
perspective. This reinforces the structuring 
of knowledge on their terms and allows the 
view of the white man to become the base-
line which other perspectives are seen as 
branching off of.

The predominance of white male profes-

sors can also lead to specific problems when 
discussing issues of gender and race. For ex-
ample, earlier this semester, I remember one 
of my professors commented admiringly on 
a book saying that, “this author is one of my 
favorites, because his women characters read 
like real people, which was not common at 
the time.” I heard that and thought: is that 
it? Is that really where we’re putting the bar: 
that women are written about as “real peo-
ple”? If that’s truly the standard by which we 
define great books, it seems like we should 
read more books by women with more real-
istic women characters.

And that’s a relatively benign example of 

the bias of white men: others can become 
much more problematic. In our interview, 
Raines also recounted in a phone interview 

an incident that occurred in a history of film 
class taught by a white man. 

“There was this one instance, we were 

talking about … this movie called ‘The Jazz 
Singer,’ (which is) about minstrelsy and the 
guy puts on blackface to become a minstrel 
performer,” Raines said. “And the profes-
sor … he goes cursorily over the movie, but 
he doesn’t talk about those elements, and I 
felt that it was a little problematic. And I said 
something in the chat (on Zoom), and he sent 
an email out saying he saw what we put in the 
Zoom chat and wasn’t delighted by that and 
wanted us to read this article that discusses 
the film and what cultural work it does. And 
I was like, ‘cultural work?’” 

Raines explained that the next day, they 

had a discussion about it in her class. “(I 
said) I think it’s important to acknowledge 
that this movie is inherently racist. And he 
kept throwing out questions and more, like, 
discursive topics, and I was like, ‘I don’t want 
to discuss it. I just want you to admit that this 
film is racist.’” 

I’m sick of learning 
from old white men

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily

Six years on from Michigan Football’s dark ages under former coach Brady Hoke, the stuggles have returned with Jim Harbaugh at the helm. The team has started the season 1-2, with losses to Michigan State and Indiana.
T

here’s 
been 
a 

refrain 
in 
Ann 

Arbor for the past 
five-plus years.

It’s persisted even as Jim 

Harbaugh’s lost thrice as a home 
favorite to Michigan State. It’s 
persisted with just one bowl 
win in his tenure. And yes, it’s 
persisted through five straight 
losses 
to 
Ohio 

State by a 
combined 95 
points.

Michigan 

hasn’t been 
able 
to 

penetrate 
college 
football’s 
elite, 
but 

“Look 
at 

where it was in 2014,” the logic 
goes. In Brady Hoke’s last 
season, the Wolverines went 3-5 
in the Big Ten and 5-7 overall. 
That 
won’t 
happen 
under 

Harbaugh, we were told.

Well, step right up and greet 

the 2020 Wolverines.

Through three weeks, the 

sixth iteration of Harbaugh’s 
Michigan is 1-2. If you’re looking 
through the record books for 
the last time that happened, you 
won’t find it in the Hoke era. 
You’ll have to go back to Rich 
Rodriguez’s first season, when 
the Wolverines finished 3-9.

In Rodriguez’s defense, that 

1-2 start came at the hands of 
Notre Dame and an undefeated 
Utah team.

Last week, Michigan lost 

to Michigan State. After the 
Spartans lost 49-7 to previously-
winless 
Iowa 
on 
Saturday, 

it’s fair to say they might not 
win another game all year. 
This 
week, 
the 
Wolverines 

were toppled by Indiana. The 
Hoosiers 
are 
a 
dangerous, 

well-coached outfit. But that 
damning fact still holds: They 
hadn’t beaten Michigan since 
1987.

So where does this leave the 

Wolverines?

The answer will be familiar 

to anyone here back in the dark 
ages, from 2008 until Harbaugh 
was hired in December 2014. 
With two losses, Big Ten title 
hopes are vanquished. Beating 
No. 3 Ohio State? Forget about 
it. Even a .500 record would be 
surprising ahead of matchups 
with Wisconsin, Penn State 
and the Buckeyes. At this point, 
Maryland and its 2-1 record 
could pose a threat.

“Personal feeling is that we’re 

close to doing it,” Harbaugh 
said when asked if he plans on 
making any changes. “You see it 
done. You see it happening and 
then it’s going to take the next 
step of happening in the games.”

Right now, it’s hard to see 

that happening. On Saturday, 
Michigan gained all of 13 yards 
on 18 carries. Its quarterback, 
junior Joe Milton, alternated 
otherworldly 
plays 
with 

mystifying 
mistakes. 
And 

then there’s the matter of 
Don Brown’s much-maligned 
defense, which, the less said, 
the better.

“Yeah, I do (have confidence 

in Brown), very much so,” 
Harbaugh said. “I love all of 
our coaches. … Their schemes 
are really good. And they coach 
them good.”

After 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defensive 
showing 
against 

Indiana, it’s hard to agree with 
any of that when it comes to 
Brown. Through three weeks, 
his defense ranks 65th in total 
yards allowed, 104th in pass 
yards allowed and 85th in 
sacks. Mainly due to defensive 
mishaps, Michigan as a whole 
ranks 105th in penalties.

None 
of 
that 
screams 

“really 
good” 
schemes 
or 

“coaching them good.” There’s 
a reason that it would be mildly 
surprising at this point to see 
Brown on the sidelines in 2021.

But Michigan’s issues are 

far more macro. In year six 
of the Harbaugh era, it’s near 
impossible to see the Wolverines 
competing for a Big Ten title or 
College Football Playoff berth 
anytime soon.

Far easier is imagining a 

team that spends the next half 
a decade toiling in mediocrity. 
Five-star 
quarterback 
J.J. 

McCarthy serves to muddle 
Michigan’s despair. But in six 
years, 
Harbaugh 
— 
praised 

as the quarterback whisperer 
when he arrived — has yet to 
develop a single NFL-quality 
signal caller.

And sure, four-star in-state 

running back Donovan Edwards 
might be joining him. But last 
week, Andrel Anthony — a 
three-star receiver commit from 
East Lansing — told the Detroit 
Free Press that Michigan’s loss 
to Michigan State “did open a lot 
of eyes. I can tell you that.”

If you’re Edwards, choosing 

between Michigan and a slew of 
programs on the doorstep of a 
national championship, staying 
home becomes a difficult sell.

“Donovan 
has 
goals,” 

Ron Bellamy, Edwards’ high 
school coach, told The Daily 
in September. “He’s a winner, 
he wants to win. He wants to 

go to a football program that 
embodies that family culture, 
a football program that has the 
opportunity to win.”

Right now, Michigan isn’t 

that program.

All of which begs the question: 

What makes 2020 Michigan any 
different than 2014 Michigan?

Over the next five weeks, 

Harbaugh needs to come up 
with the answer. Because if he 
can’t, athletic director Warde 
Manuel will be staring down 
one remaining year of a contract 
that just paid $8 million for 
mediocrity.

And if that’s the case when 

he’s deciding whether or not to 
extend Harbaugh, letting him 
walk would be a lot easier to 
justify than paying another $52 
million for seven more years of 
this.

THEO
MACKIE

Harbaugh was hired to take Michigan out of the Hoke era. Six years later, it’s back.


BLOOMINGTON 
— 
Before 

Indiana even left its locker room, 
they were celebrating here.

The students weren’t allowed 

into Memorial Stadium, but they 
showed up in the parking lot to 
sing their fight song, to chant “We 
Want Bama,” and to serenade 
Michigan goodbye. Here, on a 
night where a 24-game losing 
streak was snapped, there will be 
COVID-19 safety protocols broken 
and memories made.

The Wolverines will be left to a 

long, silent trip back to Ann Arbor 
and a handy 38-21 beating at the 
hands of Indiana (3-0), a school it 
has dominated for three decades, 
to reflect on. 

“You 
push 
forward, 
with 

toughness,” Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh said. “Every single 
guy here, every single player 
here, every single coach here 
has experienced that in their life 
where they’ve taken the adverse 
and turning it into an advantage.”

But after a week filled with 

cliches and insistence that the 
Wolverines (1-2) would bounce 
back from their loss to Michigan 
State, they came out flat, and 
now stare down the possibility 
of a calamitous season. It is their 
second straight loss, both as 
favorites, both games in which 
Don Brown’s defense seemed 
overmatched and unequipped to 
deal with a better, faster offense. 
And it was evident from the jump.

In the first half alone, Indiana 

completed drives of 74, 75 and 96 
yards for touchdowns. All featured 
Michigan 
repeatedly 
jumping 

offside when the Wolverines tried 
to time the snap count, handing 
Hoosier 
quarterback 
Michael 

Penix Jr. free plays, two of which 
resulted in touchdown passes. All 
featured the defensive backs that 
got beat in coverage by the likes of 
Ricky White last week struggling 
to keep up with Ty Fryfogle and 
Whop Philyor. None featured a 
sack. Michigan’s defense has now 
gone two games without one, 
and saw star defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson leave Saturday’s game 
in the first quarter.

Asked 
about 
the 
team’s 

struggles, 
particularly 
in 
the 

secondary, 
Harbaugh 
said 
it 

was about players trusting their 
technique and ability — what he 
at one point called their “innate 
greatness” 
— 
so 
that 
strong 

performances in practice would 
translate to the games. 

“Third downs we had many 

opportunities to get off the field,” 
sophomore safety Daxton Hill 
said. 
“Penalties, 
lackadaisical 

things, we do need to fix those and 
play the ball a lot better.”

The 
offensive 
side 
wasn’t 

blameless 
either. 
Junior 

quarterback Joe Milton finished 
18-of-34 for 344 yards and was 
lucky not to have thrown more 
than 
his 
two 
interceptions. 

Michigan ran for all of 13 yards. 
An offensive line that was missing 
two starters in tackles Ryan Hayes 
and Jalen Mayfield struggled all 
day, particularly in the run game. 
The Wolverines repeatedly put 
themselves into third-and-longs, 
then struggled to convert.

And 
when 
Michigan 
most 

needed Milton to step up, the 
deficit at 10 early in the fourth 
quarter and the defense having 

finally gotten a stop, he threw 
an ugly interception to Indiana’s 
Jaylin Williams. “Every snap he 
takes … he’s getting a lot put on 
him,” Harbaugh said. “Playing 
from behind and having to play in 
those kinds of situations.”

Nobody 
labored 
under 
the 

illusion 
that 
beating 
Indiana 

would be easy this year. Still, that 
does little to brace the impact of 
this.

Asked about the mood of the 

team, receiver Cornelius Johnson 
— the only offensive player to speak 
on Saturday — took a long pause. 
“I don’t really feel like answering 
that question right now, if that’s 
OK with you,” he finally said.

Brown, in particular, will be 

under pressure to turn things 
around after Saturday. Since 2018’s 
62-39 loss at Ohio State, there have 
been whispers about his ability to 
ready his defense for big games. 
Now, there will be shouts about his 
ability to ready his defense, period.

“Yeah, I do, very much so,” 

Harbaugh said when asked if he 
had confidence in his defensive 
coordinator. “I love all of our 
coaches. Every coach on this staff. 

They work extremely hard. Their 
schemes are really good. And they 
coach them good.”

Finding positives to harp on will 

be laborious for the coaching staff. 
The Hoosiers scored 38 points and 
gained 460 yards from scrimmage.

After Michigan opened the 

second half with a composed 
scoring drive to cut the deficit 
to 10, the defense kept itself on 
the field by committing pass 
interference on third down. Then 
it left Indiana’s Jacolby Hewitt 
open for a 32-yard catch, setting up 
running back Stevie Scott to punch 
in a touchdown from a yard out.

That was the first of two second-

half touchdowns for Scott. The 
next came after Milton’s second 
interception, when Michigan had 
a chance to make it a one-score 
game.

After 
completing 
the 

processionary 
eight 
minutes 

and 40 seconds of football that 
followed, 
the 
Wolverines 
left 

Memorial Stadium with their 
heads hung, leaving behind a town 
in celebration and looking toward 
a season in desperate need of a 
turnaround.

How will Michigan replace Aidan 

Hutchinson?

It’s been eight quarters since 

the 
Michigan 
football 
team 

recorded a sack. And on Saturday, 
things got worse.

Junior defensive end Aidan 

Hutchinson will miss the rest of 
the season and requires surgery 
to repair a fracture on his leg, 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said Monday. ESPN reported that 
Hutchinson will be out for four 
months.

“He’s 
worked 
so 
hard,” 

Harbaugh said. “He’s put so much 
into it and playing really good, but 
I know he’ll come back stronger, 
faster, better. Just the way he is. 
He is so high drive that this is 
not something that’s gonna be a 
detriment to his career. And he’s 
young, he’ll heal fast and like you 
said, he’ll come back even better 
and stronger and faster.”

Hutchinson, a team captain 

and an NFL prospect, was one of 
the loudest voices in Michigan’s 
program advocating for a season 
to be played this year. For a 
defensive line that was already 
struggling, it’s hard to quantify 
what the loss will mean, and it 
might be exacerbated if Kwity 
Paye misses extended time. 

Paye, another NFL prospect 

who starts opposite Hutchinson, 
limped off in the second half of 
Saturday’s loss to Indiana. He 
also left the Michigan State game 
with an injury but returned. Paye 
and Hutchinson combined for 10 
sacks in 2019.

“Obviously when you have 

Aidan or Kwity, two guys that 
we really rely on, go down, it’s 
gonna really affect the game,” 
junior 
defensive 
end 
Taylor 

Upshaw said Monday. “But I have 
confidence in the backups and the 
guys behind me so it’s just gonna 
be one of those things, we have to 
step up.”

Upshaw, who had a tackle for 

loss against Indiana, is now a de 
facto starter on the defensive line. 

The position group has struggled 
in the last two games, both losses 
in which the defense assumed 
much of the blame. 

“It’s a huge opportunity for 

me,” he said. “You guys probably 
know I haven’t received the 
playing time that I would’ve 
wanted, but now it’s a do-or-die 
situation, so I’m happy I get to 
showcase my skills to the nation.”

Defensive 
coordinator 
Don 

Brown has built his system 
around blitzing, pressuring the 
quarterback and supplementing 
it with press-man coverage. That 
hasn’t worked so far this year, in 
part because of inexperience in 
the secondary and in part because 
there 
hasn’t 
been 
pressure. 

Upshaw added that the line has 
seen more max protections and 

chip blocks this year.

When one part of the defense 

doesn’t go as planned, it’s hard 
to compensate. When both don’t, 
you get results like the last two 
weeks, 
in 
which 
Michigan’s 

defense gave up 460 and 449 
yards to Indiana and Michigan 
State, respectively.

In years past, the defensive 

end group has been deep. Last 
year, for example, Michael Danna 
and Josh Uche were able to spell 
Paye 
and 
Hutchinson. 
This 

year, Brown will need unproven 
players like Upshaw, Dave Ojabo, 
Luiji Vilain, Gabe Newburg and 

Kris Jenkins to step up.

Harbaugh 
also 
named 

defensive tackles Chris Hinton, 
Jess Speight and Mazi Smith on 
Monday when asked about the 
pass rush. “Giving all those guys 
the opportunity to go and see 
if we can’t generate more pass 
rush,” he said.

He repeatedly referred to 

making tweaks in order to fix 
the problems that have the 
Wolverines below .500. When 
asked for specifics, he mostly 
demurred, 
saying 
it 
would 

include giving reps to guys who 
haven’t played, as well as minor 
schematic changes.

“Guys like Kris Jenkins and 

David Ojabo (are) really ready to 
play and play fast,” Harbaugh said. 
“Just get in there and give some 

reps and get the lip quiver a little 
bit and snot bubble coming out of 
the nose. Go play aggressive, play 
hard, free plays and then come 
out and you’re playing well, get 
another three (downs).”

If that doesn’t work, it’s hard 

to see where Michigan can turn 
next. The defense is at a crisis 
point after Saturday and just 
lost one of its best players for the 
season. And the schedule doesn’t 
get any easier.

“We have to get back there,” 

Upshaw said. “At the end of 
the day it’s on us. If we’re not 
producing we have to improve.”

Milton struggles with consistency 

at Indiana

BLOOMINGTON 
— 

Cornelius Johnson kept his 
answers brief when he spoke 
to reporters. But when asked 
about the identity Michigan’s 
offense wants, he was clear.

“To 
be 
explosive 
and 

control the game and make 
plays on the perimeter, make 
plays when balls come to you 
and ultimately to win ball 
games, 
helping 
contribute 

to the team,” the sophomore 
receiver said. “That’s our goal 
as a group and that’s what we 
envision.”

In 
fleeting 
moments 

Saturday, Michigan embodied 
that ideal. Johnson’s first-
quarter 
touchdown 
came 

on a 37-yard post route that 
showed everyone exactly what 
junior quarterback Joe Milton 
could do. Later in the game, 
Milton led a touchdown drive 
that featured two big plays 
by Ronnie Bell — the second 
of 
which 
included 
Milton 

throwing as he veered left for a 
52-yard gain. In that sense, the 
preseason 
prognostications 

surrounding 
the 
talent 
of 

Michigan’s quarterback have 
come to pass.

No one has any doubt that 

Milton is capable of making 
plays.

But through three games, 

Milton has run into the problem 
of consistency. For all the 
plays where he makes the ball 
sing with a flick of his wrist, 
there seem to be more where 
he overthrows his receiver 
by 10 yards or throws into 
double coverage. He finished 
Michigan’s 
38-21 
loss 
to 

Indiana a modest 18-of-34 with 
344 yards, three touchdowns 
and two interceptions — which 
came on the Wolverines’ final 
two drives, when Milton tried 
to lead a comeback.

“It’s not always on my 

shoulders,” Milton said of the 
fourth quarter. 

On those drives, though, as 

Milton took ambitious shots 
that resulted in two ugly 
interceptions and the end of 
Michigan’s chances, it seemed 
as though he was acting like it 
was.

“My whole process is not to 

be the hero, just take what they 
give me,” Milton said. “If they 
back up, just come out to my 
checkdown. They come close, 
take a shot.”

In 
Michigan’s 
season-

opener, 
a 
dominant 
49-24 

win over Minnesota, Milton’s 
performance was notable for 
what he wasn’t asked to do: Win 
the game for the Wolverines. 
Offensive 
coordinator 
Josh 

Gattis set up the offense with 
bubble 
screens 
and 
short 

passes; designed quarterback 
runs and deadly RPOs. The 
kinds of plays that can make 
things easy for a talented, but 
inexperienced, 
quarterback. 

Rarely was Milton asked to 
make downfield throws.

Since then, Michigan has 

largely eschewed the bubble 

screens. Milton has been asked 
to do more — though part of 
that is dictated by the fact that 
the Wolverines have found 
themselves in losing positions 
that require them to throw the 
ball downfield more often.

“Every 
snap 
he 
takes, 

quarterback playing his third 
game, he’s getting a lot put 
on him,” Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh said. “Playing from 
behind and having to play 
those kind of situations. It’s 
an offense, it’s a unit that each 
has got to support the other.”

Harbaugh’s right. It does 

Milton no favors that the 
Wolverines ran for 13 yards, 
the offensive line was banged 
up or that Michigan’s defense 

has gotten beaten easily. No 
one would point the finger 
towards 
Milton 
for 
the 

Wolverines’ losses.

Still, his limitations have 

come 
into 
focus. 
Mainly, 

the downfield accuracy that 
reporters have been asking 
about for years. Milton is 
currently averaging 8.1 yards 
per 
attempt. 
The 
much-

maligned 
Shea 
Patterson 

averaged 8.0 in 2019. That 
doesn’t tell the whole story, but 
much like Patterson, Milton 
has thus far been a perfectly 
fine quarterback who hasn’t 
been able to change games for 
Michigan.

Unlike Patterson, Milton 

is three starts into his career 
— and should only get better. 
Especially if the Wolverines 
can put him in better positions.

“The run game, we’ve got to 

make some improvements. No 
question about it,” Harbaugh 
said. “The offensive line was 
very much reshuffled as you 
saw in the game. I thought 
guys 
did 
extremely 
well. 

(Andrew) Stueber went from 
right guard to right tackle. Zak 
Zinter, true freshman, started 
at right guard. I thought 
redshirt 
freshman 
Karsen 

Barnhart did some really good 
things as well (at tackle). 

“All the things — a slow 

start, playing from behind, 
having some passes dropped, 
forcing some things toward 
the end. All of those things 
contributed 
(to 
Milton’s 

performance).”

Joe Milton has struggled with his deep ball accuracy this season.

Harbaugh shutting out the noise as 

rumors swirl

It’s November in Ann Arbor, 

and for Jim Harbaugh, that means 
questions about his future. For the 
past five years, they’ve primarily 
come in the form of rumors 
that he’ll leave for an NFL job. 
This year, there’s a unique tenor. 
Specifically, will athletic director 
Warde Manuel extend Harbaugh’s 
contract, which is set to expire 
after the 2021 season?

For high-level college football 

coaches, entering the final year 
of a contract is virtually unheard 
of. Recruiting players who won’t 
step on campus for multiple years 
becomes difficult without long-
term stability.

But 
that’s 
the 
situation 

Harbaugh and Michigan find 
themselves in. Before the season, 
it seemed like an understandable 
quandary. In July, Harbaugh 
said there are “bigger fish to fry” 
than his contract extension — a 
justifiable position as he tried to 
navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.

Plus, an extension seemed 

inevitable. Despite the persistent 
rumors, Harbaugh and Michigan 
always seemed happy with each 
other. But after a 1-2 start, their 
marriage is leakier than ever.

So on Monday, the questions 

were back.

“Again, it’s your willingness and 

interest in listening to what ‘they’ 
say,” Harbaugh responded. “I don’t 

really have anything to say because 
I don’t have any real interest in 
listening to that kinda stuff. I think 
you know me by now. I always like 
letting the action speak for what 
you have to say. I have always 
thought this, that your actions 
speak so loudly that people can’t 
even hear what you’re saying. I’ll 
let the actions speak as they always 
— as they have in the past.”

For five and a half years, this 

has been Harbaugh’s operating 
method. There are not “people 
close to the situation” when it 
comes to Jim Harbaugh, because 
Harbaugh won’t allow it. He 
operates as he wants to operate. 
When he eventually leaves, it will 
almost certainly be swift and 
surprising, like it was when he was 
hired.

For now, Harbaugh says he 

wants to be at Michigan for a long 
time.

“Those 
are 
the 
actions,” 

Harbaugh said, his frustration 
at this repeated refrain seeping 
through. “And no matter what I 
say to you, I’ve been here for five 
and a half, almost six years and I’ve 
experienced this. No matter what 
I say, the next day, something else 
is said or the next year, the same 
thing comes up.”

He paused, letting out an 

exasperated laugh.

“No matter what I tell you, 

tomorrow something else will 
be written by somebody else. I’m 
gonna let my actions speak loudly. 
You know me. My actions have 

been consistent.”

True to his word, Harbaugh’s 

actions have been consistent, even 
amid Michigan’s disappointing 
start. Remember, when these 
rumors cropped up last year, 
Harbaugh sent a letter to players’ 
parents that amounted to a blanket 
denial of any NFL rumor with his 
name attached.

“His whole life is Michigan 

football,” 
fifth-year 
senior 

offensive lineman Andrew Stueber 
said. “It’s noticed in how he talks 
to players, how he carries himself, 
how he jumps into the meetings. 
He’s always the one sitting in 
the meetings, whether he’s in 
the corner or the front row, he’s 
always jotting down his notes. … 
His commitment to the team is 
unquestioned. He’s committed to 
every single player here.”

That commitment lends itself 

to a robotic persona. Rarely will 
Harbaugh abjectly criticize his 
team. Never will he deviate from 
the process that’s worked for 
him so often in the past, even if it 
appears to be failing him now.

On Monday, when he was 

asked how to maintain Michigan’s 
focus after two straight losses, his 
response was, “Get prepared for 
this game coming up. This is the 
most important thing.”

It’s not a complex psychological 

answer because Harbaugh’s focus 
is singular: Preparing for the next 
opponent.

And as always, that means 

shutting out the noise.

Defensive end Aidan Hutchinson is out for the season, a blow for 
Michigan’s struggling pass rush.

Five-star forward Moussa Diabate 

commits to Michigan

Moussa 
Diabate, 
a 
five-

star 
power 
forward 
from 

IMG Academy, committed to 
Michigan on Monday. The news 
was first reported by Tipton 
Edits. 

Diabate 
is 
currently 
the 

20th-ranked recruit in the 2021 
class, according to 247Sports 
composite rankings. He chose 
the Wolverines over offers from 
Kentucky, Arizona and Alabama. 

At 6-foot-10 and 215 pounds, 

Diabate is a physical interior 
player. He is known for his 
shot-blocking capabilities and 

presence on the offensive and 
defensive glass. 

Diabate becomes the second 

five-star to commit to Michigan 
in the past two weeks, joining 
forward Caleb Houstan, who 
committed to the Wolverines on 
Oct. 30. Even before Diabate’s 
commitment, Michigan’s 2021 
class was already listed as the 
top in the nation, according to 
247Sports. Along with Diabate 
and Houstan, the class includes 
four-star 
guards 
Frankie 

Collins and Kobe Bufkin, four-
star 
forward 
Isaiah 
Barnes 

and three-star forward Will 
Tschetter. 

It 
is 
unknown 
whether 

Diabate will sign his national 

letter of intent on early signing 
day, this Wednesday. Speaking to 
reporters over Zoom on Monday 
morning, Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard spoke of his recruiting 
philosophy. 

“We try to go get guys that 

we feel fit our culture,” Howard 
said. “And fortunately enough, 
last year’s class and now this 
upcoming class, 2021, these guys 
want to be here at Michigan. We 
want them here. We’re looking 
forward to building something 
special, a winning, competitive 
group.”

Asked later if the signees 

planned to ink their letters 
of intent on early signing day, 
Howard only said, “We’ll see.”

Aidan Hutchinson has fractured 

leg, likely out for season

According to Jim Harbaugh, 

junior defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson 
will 
require 

surgery on his leg for a fracture.

Although Harbaugh did not 

specify a timetable, Hutchinson 
is presumably out for the 
season.

Hutchinson 
suffered 
the 

injury early in the first quarter 
on Indiana’s first drive. He was 
attempting to bring Hoosiers 
quarterback 
Michael 
Penix 

down after a pass. Hutchinson 
eventually walked off under his 

own power but was later shown 
on TV in street clothes with 
a boot on his right leg, sitting 
with his mom.

With 
Hutchinson 
out, 

Michigan’s defense will take a 
significant hit, as Hutchinson 
was one of the best players on 
a defense that has struggled 
early. On Saturday, Hutchinson 
was replaced at defensive end 
by senior Luiji Vilain.

Hutchinson is a potential 

draft pick for 2021. If he chooses 
to return to school, he would 
have two years of eligibility 
remaining as 2020 does not 
count against eligibility for any 
player.

“He’s worked so hard, he’s 

put so much into it and playing 
really good but I know he’ll 
come back stronger, faster, 
better,” Harbaugh said. “Just 
the way he is, he’s so high drive 
that this is not something that’s 
gonna be a detriment to his 
career. He’s young, he’ll heal 
fast and he’ll come back even 
better and stronger and faster.”

Harbaugh did not have an 

update on junior tackle Jalen 
Mayfield, who has a high 
ankle sprain, according to the 
Detroit Free Press, or junior 
tackle Ryan Hayes, who did not 
travel to Indiana because of an 
undisclosed injury.
