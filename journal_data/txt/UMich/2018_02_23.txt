ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

After 25 years with the Ann 

Arbor Police Department — 
the last two as the head of the 
department 
— 
Police 
Chief 

Jim Baird will be relocating to 
Breckenridge, Colo., according 
to the Summit Daily of Summit 
County, Colo. Howard Lazarus, 
Ann Arbor city administrator 
announced Baird’s retirement 
from the AAPD Tuesday at the 
City Council meeting, though not 
where he would be relocating. 

“I will leave it up to him to 

share as he deems appropriate 
what life’s next great adventure 
is, but we will be preparing for an 
orderly turnover and transition,” 
Lazarus said. “We all wish the 
chief well as he chases what lies 
around the curb and the trail.”

Baird, who currently lives in 

Stockbridge, will officially step 
down on March 24, at which 
point Robert Pfannes, AAPD 
deputy police chief, will take 
over as interim chief. Baird will 
begin the job in Breckenridge on 

April 23.

Breckenridge, 
a 
town 

known for its ski resorts, has 
a population of approximately 
5,000, much smaller than Ann 
Arbor’s population of about 
120,000. However, due to the 
town’s large tourism industry, 
thousands more can flow in on 
short notice –– circumstances 
Baird 
compared 
to 
football 

games at the University of 
Michigan.

“From what I’m hearing, on 

Breckenridge’s busiest days, the 
town will swell up to 30,000 
people,” Baird told the Summit 
Daily. “For a home game, the 
University of Michigan Stadium 
in Ann Arbor holds over three 
times that. So that difference in 
scale will be significant.”

Baird’s departure comes as the 

city is considering the creation 
of a police review board that 
would review and potentially 
investigate complaints against 
the department.

University has not begun considering firms for review of its sexual misconduct policy

The University of Michigan 

will be hiring an “outside 
expert” to perform a review 
of how the University handles 
sexual misconduct reports and 
the policies that guide these 
practices. The announcement 
came eight days after the 
University’s 
revised 
sexual 

misconduct policies went into 
effect on Feb. 7.

At the Feb. 15 Board of 

Regents Meeting, University 
President Mark Schlissel laid 
out the purposes behind the 
Feb. 7 revision, which was in 
accordance with the policy’s 
annual review, and the decision 
to hire an outside firm.

“Now we will seek a broader 

examination 
of 
our 
entire 

community,” 
Schlissel 
said. 

“This 
includes 
students, 

faculty, 
staff, 
visitors 
and 

patients. We will ask an outside 
expert to assess the quality of 
our current efforts and suggest 
what we can be doing better, so 

that we can make any fixes that 
are necessary.”

University 
of 
Michigan 

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said 
while staff at the University 
“are already working on it,” 
many details of the review, 
such as which firms would be 
considered or how the review 
would be structured, were not 
yet worked out. Still, Fitzgerald 
said, the University wanted to 
demonstrate its commitment to 
overseeing an effective review.

“I think what the president 

wanted to make clear very 

quickly last week is that we’ve 
done a lot of work in this area, 
but of course we always want 
to take the opportunity to see 
if there’s more we should be 
doing, or if there’s a process 
that can be refined,” he said. 
“I would say that’s how we’ve 
done things in the past — pretty 
open and transparent. I don’t 
know how exactly this process 
will work because we haven’t 
gotten to that point yet.”

Confronting failures at MSU, ‘U’ 
begins prep for external review

Despite being a member of 

Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, 
historian 
Heather 
Bruegl 

had never been particularly 
passionate 
about 
Native 

American history or culture –– 
until she went to Wounded Knee, 
S.D., the site of the Wounded 
Knee Massacre in which 300 
Native American men, women 
and children died at the hands 
of U.S. cavalry. Bruegl now 
travels the U.S. delivering talks 
on Native American history, 
and on Thursday gave a talk 
titled “A History of Native 
American Policy and Activism: 
From A.I.M. to Standing Rock 
to Present,” to about 40 people 
gathered 
in 
the 
Michigan 

League. The lecture, hosted by 
the University of Michigan’s 
Native 
American 
Student 

Association and Multi-Ethnic 
Student Affairs, focused on 
defining moments in the history 
of Native American policy and 
activism.

Engineering senior Gabi May, 

chair of the Native American 
Student Association, discussed 
how the talk aimed to raise 
awareness of Native American 
culture among students at the 
University of Michigan.

“We’re trying to do more 

publicly engaged events that are 
focused on educating the U-M 
students on Native American 
culture and history since I 
think it’s something we miss in 

our curriculum a lot,” she said. 

Bruegl began the talk by 

explaining 
key 
government 

policies 
toward 
Native 

American 
tribes. 
She 

highlighted how many of these 
policies, including the Indian 
Removal Act, the Dawes Act and 
more, worked against the tribes’ 
favor, often stripping them of 
land, rights and representation.

She explained the somewhat 

demeaning attitude U.S. policies 
have 
typically 
had 
toward 

Native American individuals.

“You find through a lot of 

policies that there is kind of a 
parental relationship between 
the United States government 
and Native populations,” she 
said. “Every policy, they say, 
is an act to cut ties and lose 
custody of us — they don’t 
want to have to deal with us 
anymore.”

While the policies often 

inflicted pain on the Native 
American community, Bruegl 
stated they lead to the American 
Indian Movement, founded in 
1968. The organization focuses 
on representation and action 

among the Native American 
community.

She went on to discuss 

some defining instances of 
activism from the group, all 
in an effort to raise awareness 
of 
injustices 
against 
their 

community and their generally 
painful history. While not all 
of their goals were achieved, 
they reportedly did succeed 
in effectively communicating 
Native American struggles to 
the larger population.

“We didn’t exactly get what 

This Wednesday, hundreds 

of Ann Arbor high school 
students 
joined 
the 
scores 

of teenagers participating in 
national walkouts to protest 
gun violence in the wake of 
the Feb. 14 Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School shooting 
that killed 14 students and 
faculty members in Parkland, 
Fla.

According to MLive, the Ann 

Arbor School Board is working 
to support students in the fight 
to secure the safety of their 
local schools. The district’s 
response contrasts with other 
national reactions, including 
Needville Independent School 
District near Houston whose 
superintendent threatened a 
three-day suspension for any 
student who participated in a 
walkout.

Jeanice 
Swift, 

superintendent of Ann Arbor 
Public Schools, has for years 
worked to maintain weapon-
free school zones and mental 
health 
support 
systems 

throughout the school district

When she was younger, LSA 

junior Felicity Harfield always 
took longer than her classmates 
to 
read 
and 
complete 

assignments in school. As a 
result, she was separated from 
the rest of the students in her 
high school and placed in the 
special 
needs 
department. 

Hartfield’s high school special 
education teacher told her she 
was crazy for applying to the 
University of Michigan since 
she has dyslexia. Harfield is 
now a member of the Services 
for Students with Disabilities 
Advisory Board.

Harfield said her disability 

is something she has learned 
to deal with on her own. Other 
than the additional time she 
receives on exams and the 
permission to use a laptop 
in 
the 
classroom, 
Harfield 

explained she just spends more 
time on her coursework than 
others might need to.

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA sophomore Maya 
Goldman broke the story on the end of Michigan time, one of the 
University of Michigan’s oldest traditions.

“So, we heard about it in January. We heard rumors on social media, 
so we reached out to Public Affairs. They said, ‘Hold off until February, 
we’ll get you an interview with the Provost.’ So we thought it’s better 
to wait and then publish the story when we have all the facts rather 
than a scarce story now, so we waited ... My cousin is in the Nursing 
school and she told me they don’t use Michigan time at all. I reached 
out to the Nursing school and they didn’t know what Michigan time 
was. I sent this guy an email, and he was like, ‘Can you explain what 
Michigan time is to me?’ ... I think it won’t actually be as big of an 
impact as students, including myself, think it will be right now. But 
it’s definitely going to be a shock to everyone’s system in the spring 
or fall, just to make that shift in their schedules. And I do think some 
teachers will have a hard time cutting themselves off at the 50 minute 
mark right now. Eventually, it will get better. And the logic behind the 
argument for removing Michigan time is pretty sound, so I don’t blame 
them for it.”

LSA sophomore Maya Goldman, “Game over: Michigan time to be 
eliminated”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
Being mayor in Ann Arbor is a part-time job. It’s a 

weak mayor-strong (city) administrator form of 
government here. That essentially means that if you think 
of the city as a corporation, I’m the chair of the board, not 
the CEO. As chair of the board, I can’t order anyone to do 
anything. If you have a pothole, I can’t fill it for you ... In 
terms of having a targeted notion of something that 
should be done, having it at the local level and having it 
at the state level is much more approachable. There’s a 
higher likelihood of policy being effective.“

puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

Public Policy junior Daniel 

Greene has been involved in stu-
dent government since his first 
year on campus, when he par-
ticipated in LSA Student Gov-
ernment. He made the switch 
to 
Central 
Student 
Govern-

ment last year, working with 
the eMerge campaign — the 
current ticket in office led by 
president Anushka Sarkar, an 
LSA senior, and vice president 
Nadine Jawad, a Ford senior.

“I’ve always loved hearing 

what students are concerned 
about on this campus and trying 
to solve their issues, because at 
a school this large, most people 
don’t realize there are plenty of 
other people who face the same 
adversities or issues during their 
Michigan experience, but student 
government has always served 
as an aggregate to solving those 
issues,” Greene said. “So to me 
it’s about mainstreaming things.”

Greene decided he would run 

for president this year after hear-
ing from students who he said 
felt disenfranchised on campus, 
including those with more in-

visible identities as survivors of 
sexual assault or non-cisgen-
der or heterosexual students.

“I’ve been a little weary of 

everything that’s going on,” he 
said. “I’ve always ran with the 
more progressive party, and so 
what Izzy and I came together 
and did was this idea of ‘let’s run 
a campaign and a platform that’s 
based directly on direct experi-
ences.’ So between Izzy, I and 
our core team, everything that 
you’ll see in our platform speaks 
to an intimate and direct expe-
rience which someone on our 
team has had. The other thing 

is that we use that direct ex-
perience to inform what we 
feel our students who are still 
disenfranchised with student 
government, being a lot of 
people of invisible identities 
such as the LGBTQ commu-
nity, survivors, people who 
deal with mental health on a 
regular basis, and it was kind 
of this overarching desire that 
Izzy and I completely agree 
on which is the marginalized 
voice empowerment that has 
been done this past year has 
been phenomenal and a step in 
the right direction … But what 
is it to do all that work if the 
people who need to hear that 
message most on this campus 
are not listening? How can 
we find issues which impact 
all communities and all iden-
tities, and use sexual assault 
prevention or mental health 
to get communities from op-
posite corners of campus, 
who currently aren’t speak-
ing, and use that as a bridge 
to solve the current divide?”

LSA 
sophomore 
Izzy 

Baer, MVision’s vice presi-
dential candidate, also ran 

with eMerge last year and has 
spent the last year serving as 
an LSA representative. Within 
CSG, Baer is involved in pro-
moting women’s empowerment 
on campus, working with the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center and organiz-
ing a Women in Government 
event to take place in March.

Baer said one of the reasons 

she decided to run for vice presi-
dent was because of Greene, her 
running mate. She also hopes to 
continue her work with wom-
en’s empowerment in the role.

“I wanted to be working with 

Daniel because of how amazing 
he is,” she said. “So that was one 
side of things, and then the other 
is what Daniel touched upon in 
drawing from my own personal 
experiences, seeing what CSG 
can do from that side, and ac-
tually seeing what can be done 
about it. In terms of women’s em-
powerment, I grew up in a home 
where my mom always worked 
and I have two other sisters and 
that was a huge principle that we 
grew up on. Then coming to cam-
pus and seeing that it’s not always 
as easy as that, and there are oth-
er obstacles especially concern-
ing fields that have been histori-
cally underrepresented in terms 
of female faculty on campus.”

In terms of their party’s 

platform, 
Greene 
empha-

sized their work to bring to-
gether people from all parts 
of campus to create a compre-
hensive plan for what they’d 
like to accomplish if elected.

“Before we launched our team 

there was a lot of criticizing and 
stereotyping over what people 
thought we would launch, and 
when we did launch a lot of heads

something I’ve written and 
even then I’ve edited it many 
times so nobody can ever tell.”

At the University, students 

with 
learning 
disabilities 

make up the largest portion 
of students with registered 
disabilities. According to the 
2016-2017 Annual Report from 
Services for Students with 
Disabilities, 38 percent of the 
students registered with SSD 
are students with learning 
disabilities, 
about 
1,021 

students in total.

SSD Director Stuart Segal 

said 
the 
reason 
learning 

disabilities include the largest 
number of students is because 
the term “learning disabilities” 
encompasses a wide range of 
disorders and disabilities.

“We include students with 

ADHD and autism spectrum 
into the category of learning 
disabilities,” Segal said. “Even 
though it says LD (learning 
disorders), it includes a lot 
more 
than 
students 
with 

specific learning disabilities.”

Examples 
of 
SSD 

accommodations 
include 

extended time, a quiet location 
for testing, a laptop for in-class 
exams and more. However, 
the type of accommodation 
a student receives can be 
different for students who 
face the same disability. The 
accommodations are evaluated 
for each individual, according 
to Segal.

“(Accommodations 
are) 

made 
on 
the 
evidence 
of 

impairment,” 
Segal 
said. 

“Depending 
on 
the 
level 

of impairment, that would 
be 
related 
to 
what 
the 

accommodations are.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Lucie 

Rosenthal was diagnosed with 
attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder when she was in 
high school, and she currently 
receives 
extended 
time 
in 

a separate room for exams 
within the University.

“Michigan 
has 
been 

pretty 
accommodating 
with 

accommodations,” 
Rosenthal 

said. “Even in large lectures, 
professors have been helpful.”

Rosenthal said the process 

of getting additional time was 
not overly difficult. Once she 
had paperwork from her doctor 
processed by SSD, she was 
granted the accommodation 
she needed.

Harfield 
also 
said 

specific 
professors 
at 

the 
University 
have 
been 

especially 
accommodating 

for 
her 
including 
lecturer 

Brenda Gunderson from the 
Department of Statistics. For 
Harfield, common fonts like 
Times New Roman are difficult 
to read because the letters are 
very uniform. As a part of her 
accommodation, 
Gunderson 

purchased a special font for 
Hartfield’s exam so it would be 
easier for her to read.

In 
an 
email 
interview, 

Gunderson wrote that most 
of 
the 
accommodations 
in 

her class relate to the exams. 

Stats 250 has a separate email 
address for students to discuss 
conflicts and accommodations 
regarding exams. Gunderson 
also requests rooms specifically 
with tables instead of chairs 
with table arms to provide a 
good environment for students 
receiving extra time for their 
exams.

“I learn so much from our 

students,” Gunderson wrote. 
“It is from Felicity that I 
learned about how a cool 
special font can help people 
with dyslexia to read.”

Celina 
DeFigueiredo-

Dusseau 
graduated 
the 

University last semester and 
will start graduate school the 
School of Public Health next 
fall. 
DeFigueiredo-Dusseau 

has ADHD and has a specific 
learning disability in reading, 
math, and writing. Her SLD 
surfaced during her freshman 
year when she experienced 
seizures and problems with 
her 
memory. 
According 
to 

DeFigueiredo-Dusseau, 
it’s 
possible 
her 
learning 

disabilities appeared from the 
effects of a traumatic brain 
injury in her childhood.

As 
an 
accommodation, 

SSD provided DeFigueiredo-
Dusseau with a Livescribe pen, 
which is able to record what 
she’s hearing in class while she 
is writing it. The Livescribe 
pen allowed her to replay parts 
of lectures as she sometimes 
faces difficulty remembering 
what was said while she is 
writing.

As 
a 
graduate 
student, 

DeFigueiredo-Dusseau 
said 

all of her accommodations 
will carry over to graduate 
school, though she has noticed 
a smaller presence of students 
with disabilities heading to 
higher levels of academia.

“As I transition to graduate 

school, what I’m noticing is 
many students with disabilities 
don’t make it to graduate 
school,” 
DeFigueiredo-

Dusseau said. “I’m finding that 
a lot of the leadership and the 
faculty don’t how to deal with 
(disabilities) quite as well, but 
they are very willing to help.”

In her four years at the 

University, 
DeFigueiredo-

Dusseau explained she has 
seen improvement in how the 
University helps students with 
disabilities. She is currently 
a member of the SSD Student 
Advisory Board with Harfield.

For Rosenthal, sometimes 

she gets weird looks from her 
friends when she takes an 
exam in a different classroom. 
For Harfield, she has noted 
some students will joke about 
dyslexia 
when 
they 
make 

grammar or spelling mistakes.

“It’s a fact, it’s like saying I 

have a brother,” Hartfield said. 
“I have dyslexia.”

Segal 
said 
the 

accommodations 
from 
SSD 

can’t 
alter 
the

to protect students. At a school 
board 
meeting 
Wednesday, 

Swift 
applauded 
students’ 

peaceful efforts to voice their 
concern 
regarding 
school 

safety.

“Let me be clear, the presence 

of a weapon or a gun in school 
runs contrary to everything we 
are wired to do in education 
for children,” Swift said. “We 
believe it is counterproductive 
to 
maintaining 
a 
rich, 

productive 
and 
healthy 

learning environment for our 
children every day in school.”

In some cases, the student 

walkouts 
infringed 
on 

classroom instructional time 
for 
students. 
Board 
Vice 

President Susan Baskett said 
she wanted the efforts to be 
collaborative between students, 
teachers 
and 
supervisors, 

because she disapproved of 
losing time in class.

“To our students, let us help 

you take action with a purpose. 
… Don’t be dismissive of us,” 
Baskett said. “Again, we don’t 
want to lead this because, truly, 
I think the most effective body 
in this work will be the young 
people themselves.”

Board Trustee Jessica Kelly 

considered 
the 
incident 
in 

Parkland a “tipping point.” 
She welcomed ideas on better 
ways to support students in the 
fight for school safety and gun 
control.

The walkouts on Wednesday 

also 
called 
into 
question 

students’ 
First 
Amendment 

rights in a school setting. 
According to Ann Arbor Public 
Schools’ policy, as referenced 
by 
Swift, 
students’ 
may 

express their opinions without 
disrupting 
normal 
school 

routine.

Board Secretary Jeff Gaynor 

said during the meeting it is 
the job of educators to support 
students without undercutting 
their message.

“We as educators, it’s our 

responsibility to help them 
define the issue, refine the 
issue,” Gaynor said.

Emma Roth, a senior at 

Pioneer High School and an 
organizer of the walkout, said 
she was grateful the board 
was supporting students and 
feels there is momentum for 
students to push for change. 
Roth is optimistic in seeing 
a change, especially with the 
power in the hands of students.

“It makes me really, really 

happy that (the school board 
members) are behind us right 
now,” Roth said to MLive. “I 
think students are the voice we 
need right now. It feels almost 
like passing a torch.”

Institutional 
Equity 
in 

January showed a 40 percent 
increase in sexual misconduct 
reports from 2016 to 2017. 
Of the 218 reports made to 
OIE between July 2016 and 
June 2017, 82 were deemed 
outside “the scope of the 
policy.” Twenty-eight were 
formally 
investigated, 
and 

111 were reviewed by an OIE 
panel. Of the cases which 
were 
investigated, 
only 
8 

found a student in violation of 
University rules. 

The University’s attention 

to 
examining 
its 
current 

practices 
comes 
shortly 

after the sentencing of Larry 
Nassar, the former Michigan 
State 
University 
and 
USA 

Gymnastics 
doctor 
who 

sexually abused hundreds of 
young girls and women he 
was supposed to be treating. 
Investigations by ESPN and 
The Detroit News in the wake 
of 
the 
Nassar 
sentencing 

revealed the degree to which 
the case reflected a failure 
of MSU administration and 
staff on multiple levels, and 
also extended to other areas 
of MSU’s athletic department.

The 
announcement 
also 

follows 
two 
incidences 

of 
possession 
of 
child 

pornography 
by 
University 

of Michigan employees. On 
Feb. 12, Mark Hoeltzel, a 
former University pediatric 
rheumatology 
specialist, 

was 
arrested 
at 
Detroit 

Metropolitan 
Airport 

for 
possession 
of 
child 

pornography 
–– 
Hoetzel 

also had a two-year sexual 
relationship with one of his 
patients, who started seeing 
him for treatment at age 17. 
On Feb. 13, Clifford Raymond 
Bingham, a former professor 
at 
the 
University, 
was 

sentenced to 90 days in jail for 
child pornography possession.

In 
April 
2017, 
before 

many of the revelations of 
the flaws in MSU’s sexual 
misconduct practices, MSU’s 
then-President, 
Lou 
Anna 

K. Simon, also called for an 
independent 
review 
of 
its 

sexual misconduct policies. 
Simon’s announcement was 
part of her administration’s 
response to the Larry Nassar 
allegations.

MSU hired the law firm 

Husch Blackwell to conduct 
the initial review. On Nov. 
20, 2017, Husch Blackwell 
published a report detailing 
their 
investigation, 
which 

found MSU was Title IX 
compliant, saying the policies 

“reflect a strong and genuine 
institutional 
commitment 

to 
combatting 
sexual 

misconduct.” 

A press release published 

on Feb. 13 announced MSU 
would 
engage 
in 
another 

review led by investigative 
risk consulting firm Kroll to 
address Title IX complaints.

Social Work student Nicole 

Bedera researches Title IX 
on 
college 
campuses, 
and 

explained organizations are 
often prompted to participate 
in an external review by a 
new event or development. In 
the case of the University’s 
decision to pursue an external 
review, Bedera believes the 
decision can be attributed to 
the Larry Nassar trials and 
the fact that the University 
of Michigan and Michigan 
State University are in close 
connection.

According to Bedera, the 

hiring process for firms that 
lead external investigations 
depend on the types of results 
an organization hopes to yield 
and the insights on sexual 
misconduct they hope to gain. 
Bedera made the distinction 
that a legally-focused firm 
would likely consider issues 
like compliance and the legal 
soundness of an institution’s 
policies, whereas a socially-
focused firm may focus the 

investigation more heavily on 
the student experience.

While 
details 
of 
the 

University’s 
firm 
hiring 

process 
have 
not 
been 

announced, 
Berdera 
hopes 

those 
involved 
in 
the 

investigation will seek out 
the perspective of faculty, 
researchers and students on 
campus who have valuable 
insights on the issue of sexual 
misconduct 
and 
how 
the 

University interacts with the 
issue on campus.

“As we are moving towards 

this external review, one thing 
that I hope the University will 
be doing is turning to a lot of 
experts about sexual violence 
on the campus who should 
be chiming in,” Bedera said. 
“And by experts I don’t mean 
just necessarily researchers, 
but also people who have 
been through an adjudication 
process 
on 
campus, 
who 

have been involved in sexual 
misconduct claims whether 
they are making them or they 
are the one they have been 
made about, and I hope those 
people who know Michigan 
really well will have a chance 
to speak about their own 
experiences.”

we wanted, but we made sure you 
knew what was happening in our 
communities,” she said.

Bruegl 
discussed 
A.I.M.’s 

success in reinvigorating the 
Native American community as 
a whole, citing the establishment 
of tribal colleges, reestablishing 
traditional cultures, languages 
and religion, and bringing about 
federal policy change expanding 
the rights of Native American 
citizens.

Bruegl 
then 
centered 
the 

discussion 
on 
present-day 

controversies faced by Native 
Americans, citing issues from 
Standing Rock, a controversy 
surrounding the establishment 
of the Dakota Access Pipeline 
running 
oil 
underneath 
the 

Missouri River, to the Back 
40 Mine, a lesser known issue 
regarding an open pit sulfite mine 
which could potentially leak into 
the mouth of the Menominee 
River, a sacred place for the 
Menominee Nation of Wisconsin. 
She also discussed the threat of 
privatization of native land by 
the federal government to easily 
gain natural resources.

Bruegl implored the audience 

to 
increase 
their 
awareness 

of 
Native 
American 
history 

and culture through studying 
literature 
and 
watching 

documentaries. 
May 
also 

announced 
an 
upcoming 

powwow 
celebrating 
Native 

American culture, being held 
March 24 and 25 at Skyline High 
School in Ann Arbor.

Bruegl ended the discussion by 

citing a need for more awareness 
of Native American activism and 
policy.

“Everybody likes the Native 

American that talks about peace, 
love and nature, but nobody 
likes the one who talks about 
what really happened which is 
genocide, rape, and stolen land 
— nobody talks about that,” she 
said. “In order to get a full, well-
rounded history on this, you have 
to really look out there.”

After the lecture, LSA senior 

Queena Zhao agreed on the 
importance of gaining awareness 
for diverse identities on campus.

“I’m in an Asian-American 

interest sorority, and we all want 
to learn about other people’s 
cultures,” Zhao said. “We know 
there are struggles within our 
own culture and we know there 
are struggles with other people’s 
cultures, and throughout history, 
you find that when people work 
together, they figure out those 
struggles better.”

were turned because we committed 
to what our bigger picture goal is — 
which is to bring people together 
who aren’t currently speaking from 
different communities and so our 
team touches almost every corner 
of campus and I would say our 
team also has perhaps, I would say, 
the most out of any other team right 
now, people who are brand new to 
CSG— which sometimes can be a 
little chaotic, but also keeps that 
voice towards what the actual aver-
age student is — because I think it’s 
about 14 to 18 percent of students 
which actually vote in CSG elec-
tions, which is unacceptable to me.”

MVision’s platform points in-

clude more meetings on North 
Campus 
and 
bringing 
back 

monthly 
town 
hall 
meetings.

“We want to re-establish hav-

ing meetings on North Campus,” 
Greene said. “A large chunk of our 
student body lives and interacts 
and has their academics always on 
North and in my mind it’s a little 
disrespectful to assume everything 
has to be on Central Campus. We 
want to bring back monthly town 
hall meetings, where we can have 
any student show up and voice 
their concerns on any topic, but 
we also want to have structured 
town hall meetings where we have 
sexual assault prevention, mental 
health, LGBTQ issues, even Greek 
life. Anything that’s going on and is 
a hot topic issue, to allow the people 
come together without the 30-min-
ute timeline of community con-
cerns on Tuesday and actually have 

two or three hours of just us listen-
ing, and I think right now, given 
everything that’s going on not only 
in the national dialogue but on our 
campus — especially with Richard 
Spencer trying to come — I think 
that the best qualities for leaders 
goes through a cycle, and mov-
ing into next year, one of the most 
important things we can, or who-
ever wins, can do is be a listener.”

Baer also brought up MVi-

sion’s work to create an inclu-
sive 
environment 
right 
away 

by reaching out to students for 
suggestions on their platform.

“I think the other big way that 

we’ve been trying to build an inclu-
sive party is through our platform 
itself,” she said. “At first people 
were like you, ‘launched a website 
without a platform, you launched 
a party without a platform’, but 
first we really wanted to get people 
with our values and that was the 
first thing that came out instead 
of the platform points. We really 
wanted to make it so any student 
could submit what they want.”

Greene said he also hopes to focus 

increasing representation through-
out campus for minority identities.

“In terms of what I’m most 

passionate about outside of the 
direct experience, is the under-
representation in terms of CAPS 
(Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services) counselors, the Spec-
trum Center, administrators, pro-
fessors and lecturers of course — I 
mean that not only by physical 
identities which are obvious, but 
also invisible identities,” he said.

Bridging human and animal rights

Keep guns away from abusers 

T

he 
routine 
abuse 
of 

animals 
across 
several 

major industries is well 

documented, but the 
vast majority of people 
in the United States 
continue to use animals 
as 
commodities 
in 

various aspects of their 
life. This is especially 
prominent in our diets; 
the average American 
man eats 6.9 ounces 
of meat per day and, 
according to a Tyson 
spokesman, overall meat 
consumption has steadily increased 
over the past five years. While 
plant-based eating is becoming 
more culturally accepted, still only 
about 3 percent of the population 
adopts a totally vegan or vegetarian 
diet.

One of the major rationales 

for going vegan or vegetarian — 
and arguably the most polarizing 
— is the wish to advance animal 
rights and welfare, the idea that 
eating animal products is cruel 
and unethical. In my eight years of 
being vegetarian, I’ve had countless 
conversations with meat-eating 
friends, classmates and family 
members about the ethics of meat. 
Arguments against vegetarianism/
veganism have run the gamut from 
hypothetical scenarios in which I’m 
stuck on an island and, somehow, 
only have animals available as 
food to exasperated sighs of bacon 
simply being too good to give up.

Eating meat has felt, at times, 

like an even more delicate, difficult 
discussion among my social circles 
on campus, which are filled with 
progressive 
college 
students 

who often advocate for multiple 
social causes. I’ve heard time 
and time again a line of thinking 
from progressive friends who eat 
meat that revolves around how 
vegans and vegetarians unfairly 
ignore human issues. For example, 
I’ve often heard that vegans and 
vegatarians 
are 
hypocritical 

because they need to care more 
about underpaid immigrants who 
pick their vegetables — despite 
the fact that raising animals for 
slaughter 
requires 
significant 

crop production and workers in 
slaughterhouses often face post-
traumatic stress disorder and other 
health issues.

This kind of logic, depending 

on 
context, 
implies 
that 

vegetarianism/veganism is either 
directly at odds with human 
interests or that it’s too trivial to 
consider while we are battling 
against so many other forms of 
oppression. But growing up, my 
feminism actually materialized 
in part because of the mental 
work I was doing by transitioning 
away from meat — reevaluating 
my 
daily 
choices, 
examining 

the violent power structures in 
customs I had previously taken as 
a given, realizing how the erasure 
of a group’s voice can completely 
erase consideration of its interests. 
These thought processes, and the 
more intentional relationship I 
built with my food as a result of 
them, catalyzed a more progressive 

mindset as a whole in me.

Why are many of my peers 

— 
otherwise 
committed 
to 

recognizing 
the 

experiences of those 
with 
marginalized 

identities 
— 
quick 

to dismiss work on 
behalf 
of 
animals 

that suffer for our 
consumption? In an 
environment 
where 

it’s considered critical 
to raise awareness 
of 
discrimination 

against 
various 

groups of humans, why treat 
the oppression of animals and of 
humans as incompatible worlds, as 
being unconnected? Why is our gut 
instinct to draw a line in the sand 
when it comes to our relationship 
with animals?

I believe the narrative of animal 

activism being at odds with human 
activism, or at least peripheral to 
human activism, is misleading. 
It likely stems from, at best, 
defensiveness about the notion 
of erasing habits so intricately 
linked to our culture and lifestyle 
or, at worst, a complete emotional 
separation from species considered 
edible or otherwise designated for 
our use.

Several recent theories have 

examined a kind of dominant 
ideology that pervades our mental 
understandings and institutional 
treatment of animals, ultimately 
guiding us to oppress them and 
see our perceived supremacy over 
them as normal and natural. For 
example, social psychologist and 
professor Melanie Joy argues 
that carnism pervades our society 
and convinces us eating certain 
animals is a given, not a choice. 
Professor and philosopher Peter 
Singer has popularized the concept 
of speciesism, or a prevalent 
attitude among humans of bias 
against non-human beings because 
of their species.

There’s a more integrative way 

to approach this issue, and I saw a 
reflection of my own journey with 
vegetarianism and feminism in my 
Sociology of the Body course last 
semester. Sociology lecturer Luis 
Sfeir-Younis began the course by 
illustrating societal conceptions and 
treatment of animal bodies in the 
first two sessions. Throughout the 
semester, he teased out the distinct 
experiences of other marginalized 
groups such as women, people of 
color or fat people. He often showed 
how these groups are dehumanized 
through being compared to — or 
implicitly treated like — animals.

In my interview with him last 

week, he explained his intentions 
with the course structure: “Because 
we are human beings, it is sometimes 
hard to be critical of our own 
experiences. The conversation on 
animals gives us the kind of distance 
that allows us to go more in-depth 
in understanding the concepts of 
the course. There is no living being 
that has been objectified as much as 
animals, to the point that the legal 
system in most countries considers 
animals to be things, to be property.”

Sfeir-Younis’s 
teachings 

demonstrate how oppression of 
marginalized groups is achieved 
through common mental processes 
such as homogenization, which 
removes individual identities and 
consequent empathy for members of 
a given group. If we think of certain 
groups as a category, rather than a 
set of individuals with sentience, 
consciousness or personalities, it’s 
much easier to ignore their interests 
and justify poor treatment of them.

“Animals are homogenized into 

one category even though they are 
billions of unique beings,” he said. 
“We use language that makes them 
distant from ourselves, apart from 
ourselves, as being instruments for 
our own satisfaction and pleasure 
… When we talk about the bodies of 
women being fragmented, it’s hard 
for people to understand that. But 
when we talk about animals, people 
can see how a body is divided into 
parts we’ll be using or consuming in 
the future.”

He’s careful not to make 

judgments 
on 
the 
relative 

importance of different groups’ 
suffering. 
But, 
he 
emphasizes 

how certain common elements 
thread through the mechanisms 
of injustice against many groups: 
“In my opinion, when you work for 
animals or for any other cause, you 
are actually trying to dismantle 
the same matrix that causes the 
suffering of different kinds of 
humans and non-human animals.” 
His course ultimately bridges the 
gap in the two supposed worlds 
of oppression of animals and 
oppression of humans. It doesn’t 
ignore animal issues, but instead 
utilizes them as a key framework for 
understanding oppressive processes 
as a whole.

Empathizing and advocating 

for one group can help us, in turn, 
develop more empathy for others. 
Learning about animal issues and 
adopting a vegetarian or veganism 
diet 
can 
especially 
reinforce 

progressive action in other areas 
because it’s one of the simplest, 
most practical ways to embody 
personal values and truly live one’s 
convictions. It’s the kind of activism 
that tangibly plays out multiple 
times a day, each time we sit down 
to eat.

My journey with vegetarianism 

has 
profoundly 
changed 
my 

understanding of my own potential 
to impact lives and fight for a cause. 
I implore readers to think critically 
about the oppression of all beings 
and what they can do on a day-to-
day basis to fight these systems.

O

n Feb. 14, much of the world 
celebrated 
Valentine’s 

Day and Ash Wednesday: 

holidays that honor love 
and peace. In the U.S., we 
mourned the deaths of 17 
high school students and 
faculty who were brutally 
murdered in the 30th 
mass shooting this year. Of 
course, a school shooting 
that resulted in 17 deaths 
is much different than 
other 
mass 
shootings, 

some of which resulted 
in no fatalities. But in no 
way was this unprecedented — only 
five months ago, a shooting in Las 
Vegas resulted in the highest death 
toll from a mass shooting yet.

(An aside: Mass shootings are 

a uniquely American phenomenon. 
Thirty-one 
percent 
of 
mass 

shootings in the world happen here, 
and yet we continue to respond by 
calling for more guns. Our Congress 
continues 
to 
respond 
by 
not 

responding. We — ignorantly — call 
it a mental health problem, then cut 
mental health funding. Don’t forget 
that this is insane).

The shooter in Parkland, Fla., 

was 
19-year-old 
Nikolas 
Cruz. 

Cruz had a history of abusive and 
misogynistic 
behavior 
toward 

women. His teacher reported that 
he was stalking a female peer, his 
ex-girlfriend broke up with him 
because of his violent and abusive 
behavior and he was ultimately 
expelled for getting into a fight with 
his ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend. 
Why do I find this so significant? 
Because 54 percent of mass shootings 
have roots in domestic violence. 
Because the Orlando shooter who 
murdered 49 people June 12, 2016 
physically abused his wife. Because 
the Texas shooter who murdered 
people in their place of worship 
on Nov. 5 horrifically assaulted 
his ex-wife, who says she lived in 
“constant fear” of him. Because the 
Las Vegas shooter who killed 58 
people Oct. 1 acted abusively toward 
his girlfriend as well. There is a 
significant and obvious link between 
abuse of women and mass shootings, 
but we ignore this and blame it on 
mental illness.

Mental illness is not the cause 

of abusive, possessive and criminal 
behavior toward women. Stop 
stigmatizing non-violent Americans 

and recognize that the problem is a 
pervasive misogynistic culture that 
normalizes violence against women. 

Toxic 
masculinity 

and 
guns 
are 
a 

lethal 
combination, 

and it is one I am 
so tired of trying to 
convince people to 
recognize. I’m tired 
of searching every 
mass shooter’s name 
and finding exactly 
what I’m looking for: 
a history of abuse 
toward women. I’m 

so, so tired of remembering how 
little this country cares about the 
welfare and safety of its women, 
despite its constant attempts to 
downplay our agency.

It is illegal for convicted abusers 

to buy guns in this country. They do, 
though, as we see too often when it 
results in abusive husbands killing 
their wives, their kids and their 
community members. How? When 
an abuser is convicted, only 15 states 
actually require they turn in their 
guns. In 35 states, a domestic abuser 
can be proven to be a violent person, 
legally recognized as an abuser 
and continue to have a house full of 
firearms. The Texas shooter was a 
convicted domestic abuser, but the 
U.S. Air Force failed to report his 
conviction to the FBI. So, he was able 
to buy a gun that he used to commit 
mass murder. In all but 19 states, 
it wouldn’t have even mattered if 
the FBI was aware, because only 
19 states require a full background 
check when buying a gun online or 
in a gun show.

We 
are 
allowing 
innocent 

people to be in the presence of armed 
violent criminals every day. Women 
are leaving abusive relationships, 
bravely take the steps to report 
the abuse, and our laws are failing 
them horribly. Our laws are failing 
all of us horribly, because not only 
are the women, children and family 
members linked to these men at risk, 
but all of us are. We are all threatened 
by the reality of violent individuals 
possessing weapons of murder.

Beyond 
mass 
shootings, 

American women are killed every 
day by guns in an epidemic that 
lawmakers ignore. Every month, 
about 50 American women are 
fatally shot by an intimate partner. 
Silently, women are being gunned 

down in their homes and in their 
workplaces — the places they feel 
safest. Some suggest women should 
arm themselves, just as they suggest 
teachers should be armed, grocery 
shoppers should be armed, and so on. 
Americans really like the idea that 
further militarizing our society will 
somehow bring us peace. It won’t, 
but unfortunately the National Rifle 
Association will always be more 
sacred than our lives. Anyway, 
when women do arm themselves, 
they increase the potential of being 
murdered by more than 50 percent.

The statistics are dark and 

disheartening. The cycle of mass 
shootings, the prevalence of gun 
deaths each day, the power of 
lobbying groups, the apathy of 
those in power, it all feels as though 
we are powerless in the fight for 
our lives. There are solutions 
though: solutions that work in 
other countries and solutions that 
have worked in our own country. 
In states that simply require 
background checks on all gun 
purchases, 
including 
online 

and at gun shows, 47 percent 
fewer women are fatally shot by 
intimate partners.

Treating 
domestic 
abuse 

like a private family matter is 
unacceptable. It is unacceptable 
because it puts victims in danger 
and leaves them living in fear. This 
has historically not been reason 
enough to act, though. So, ignoring 
the serious criminality of domestic 
abuse also puts all Americans in 
danger. We claim to want guns out 
of the hands of violent individuals, 
so let’s start here. Let’s enforce the 
laws we already have on the table, 
enact comprehensive background 
checks for all purchases and 
require that all weapons are 
taken from convicted domestic 
abusers — in every state. Let’s treat 
domestic abuse like the pervasive 
and criminal problem that it is, not 
a personal matter to be left up to 
personal mediation.

Let’s protect and empower 

women.

T

he 2018 Academy Awards, 
otherwise 
known 
as 

the Oscars, will be held 

on March 4th, and as the awards 
ceremony 
approaches, 
I 
have 

been trying to see all of the highly-
anticipated nominees, since they are 
generally considered to be the most 
important films of the year. And 
according to the numbers, the most 
important of these important films 
is Guillermo Del Toro’s The Shape 
of Water. It’s the most-nominated 
film this year, with a total of 13 
nominations, including Best Picture 
and Best Director. The critical 
appeal of this was intriguing to me, 
so I was really excited when I finally 
got the chance to see it. However, 
my excitement was very, very 
short-lived.

Actually, a better word to 

describe what I felt sitting in the 
movie 
theater 
was: 
confusion. 

I asked myself: Am I missing 
something? I kept waiting for 
something remarkable to happen. 
As the film continued, I grew more 
and more disappointed. I thought, 
maybe this is it. Maybe one of 2018’s 
most groundbreaking films really 
is an unoriginal, perverted sexual 
fantasy that is not groundbreaking at 
all. Rather, it relies on the excessive 
sexualization of a female protagonist 
that is portrayed through the eyes of 
a male director and an undercredited 
supporting role of a black colleague 
and gay best friend; it reflects age-old 
patterns in Hollywood that reflect 
the problematic way our society 
functions in terms of sexism, racism 
and phallic worship.

As I processed the film, my 

confusion turned to anger and 
frustration. In fact, I was so 
frustrated that I abandoned what 
I was originally planning to write 
about this week to talk about it.

Let’s start my complaints with 

the protagonist: Elisa Esposito, a 
janitor working in a secret military 
laboratory. Elisa has been mute 
since birth and she expresses herself 
through sign language and facial 
expressions. The audience gets to 
know Elisa pretty quickly; within 
the first five minutes of the film, we 

see Elisa’s naked body in its entirety 
when she masturbates in her bathtub. 
Some critics consider this scene as a 
display of Elisa’s sexual liberty, even 
calling Del Torro a feminist for it. To 
me, this is not feminism. It shows 
nothing more but the male gaze of 
a straight male director. Why do 
we need to see Elisa’s naked body 
multiple times throughout the film, 
but her amphibian lover doesn’t 
even have genitalia? Sure, he might 
technically be “naked” throughout 
the film, but he is a fish: with 
scales covering his entire body and 
webbed hands, he’s not so sexy. 
Why is her body objectified when 
he gets his privacy?

Another 
appalling 
theme 

that seems to have slipped by The 
Academy is the fetishization of 
Elisa’s muteness, a fact which is 
unbelievably offensive, gross and 
twisted. Throughout the movie, 
the main antagonist, Colonel 
Richard Strickland, expresses a 
boorish sexual desire towards 
Elisa based solely on the fact that 
she is mute. In Matt Lauer fashion, 
Strickland locks Elisa in his office 
and proceeds to tell her how he 
would like to have sex with her 
because she would not be able to 
verbally refuse.

How is this “feminism”? In 

light of the #MeToo movement, 
this is what the The Academy 
picked? 
This 
isn’t 
sexual 

liberation; 
it’s 
just 
another 

reinforcement of the backwards 
construction of gender in our 
society: the domineering man and 
his submissive female subordinate. 
As 
the 
director, 
Del 
Torro 

could have been so much more 
groundbreaking with the way 
he utilized a female protagonist. 
Instead, he chose to focus on her 
sex appeal and the fetishization of 
her disability.

I think this has something to do 

with the fact that so many movies 
in Hollywood continue to be 
directed by men. For example, even 
after the publicity of the #MeToo 
Movement, only one out of every 
22 directors is a female — that’s 
only 4 percent! Furthermore, the 

trend is reflected during awards 
season: Not a single woman was 
nominated for best director award 
at this year’s Golden Globe awards. 
And this year, Rachel Morrison 
became the very first woman to 
be nominated for the award for 
Best Cinematography for her work 
on the film Mudbound. I’m not 
jumping to any conclusions, but 
I can’t help but wonder about the 
correlation between a constant 
need to sexualize women and 
the looming presence of male 
directors. Perhaps if we had 
more female directors, then the 
ubiquitous male eye would dissolve 
and allow female characters to be 
presented in something other than 
a sensual manner.

When I learned that Octavia 

Spencer had a role in The Shape 
of Water, I was excited. After all, 
she is the first black woman in 
Hollywood history to have three 
Oscar nominations (one of which 
became a win). However, much to 
my disappointment, it became very 
clear within the first few scenes 
exactly what type of role Octavia 
would be playing: a supporting 
character. Her character, Zelda, 
is so overlooked that I barely even 
noticed she was there. I am so 
tired of seeing black actors being 
represented as secondary to an 
all-white cast. I understand this 
movie is supposed to take place 
during the 1960s, a period marked 
by racial segregation, but if the 
main character’s love interest is 
an amphibian, would it really be so 
crazy to have a black heroine too? 
How have we gotten to the point 
where a non-human creature has a 
bigger role in a movie than Octavia 
Spencer? How can a movie that is 
nominated for 13 Academy Awards 
operate on such a primitive model 
of racial representation?

The Shape of Water isn’t groundbreaking

Aaron Maine, the frontman and 

creative genius behind Porches, is 
a man who definitely knows how 
to move his hips. With each groovy 
pop hit (whether he was donning 
a guitar or not), more often than 
not Maine would be swaying with 
each syncopated beat. Entrancing 
and enticing, Maine captivates 
a crowd with little more than 
his rhythmic movements and a 
tempting stare.

However, the show at Detroit’s 

El Club didn’t start out with such 
a commanding presence. It took 
Maine and the rest of the band a 
few songs to really warm up to the 
rather rudely outspoken crowd, 
but once in their element, their 
craft was pure magic. By the third 
song, Porches’s foray into trance-
pop “Find Me,” Maine’s persona 
was magnetic.

Opening his set with the first 

track on Pool, “Underwater,” and 
the celestial synthline expertly 
set the tone for the rest of night. 
Porches’s cohesive brand of deep 
bass and floaty synths rarely 
strayed far from these dancey 
beats, placing emphasis on each 

clearly delivered syllable from 
Maine’s aching, monotone drawl. 
Despite touring in support of his 
recently released third album 
The House, the set included a 
surprising number of cuts from his 
sophomore album Pool, including 
“Mood,” “Braid” and “Glow,” 
inciting enthusiastic responses 
from the majority of the packed 
crowd.

Most surprisingly was the band’s 

stripped down version of normally 
upbeat The House opener “Leave 
the House,” featuring a slowed 
tempo, minimal instrumentals 
and harmonic accompaniment 
underneath Maine’s verses. Yet, 
even the more produced tracks 
on the album like “Find Me” and 
“Anymore” had a more organic 
feel to their live performance, 
sometimes 
featuring 
Maine 

playing a piercing cowbell. Every 
guitar note vibrated a little more 
clearly in conjunction with the 
sound live drums brought to the 
forefront, contrasting their more 
toned down presence during the 
final mixing of most of Porches’s 
music. It felt like an entirely new 
experience hearing live versions 
of such highly produced and 
meticulously mixed tracks.

The encore left much to be 

wondered after the band first 
left the stage, having already 
played most of their hits during 
their regular set like “Car” and 
“Find Me.” Maine first came out 
with one of their keyboardists to 
give a beautiful rendition of the 
minimalistic “Country,” before 
the rest of the band came out 
to perform shocking deep cut 
“Headsgiving” from their first 
album Slow Dance in the Cosmos, 
rounding out the set with a 
throwback to their indie rock 
roots.

Aaron Maine is probably very 

aware of his charisma; it radiates 
off him with an addictive quality 
— his confidence intoxicating, 
like a blinding sun we allow him 
to burn into our retinas. Leaving 
El Club on Tuesday night, that 
image of Maine irradiated and 
backlit on stage was stamped into 
my memories. Their music left 
me wanting more — not for lack 
of quality or fulfillment but rather 
out of pure addiction for the well-
oiled machine that is Porches. 
“Goodbye” (which Maine noted 
to be his favorite song from The 
House), with its poppy beats and 
tender piano melodies, sums up 
the show well: “It is so sad to say 
‘goodbye.’”

MUSIC ALBUM REVIEW

I come from a thoroughly 

bookish family. Our relationships 
have always been mediated by the 
writers and stories we’ve handed 
over to each other like little pieces 
of ourselves, and sometimes I 
think that the most enduringly 
true things I know about these 
people whose lives are so tangled 
with mine are the books they’ve 
loved. As the youngest, I got 
everyone else’s literary hand-
me-downs. When I was little, my 
brothers gave me “Harry Potter” 
and “Percy Jackson,” stories that 
gave us a common language and 
fantasy worlds we could live in 
together.

When I was a teenager, my dad 

gave me “Pride and Prejudice,” 
and when I read it I saw the things 
he loved about it: The sublime 
order of a world with such pristine 
rules and manners, and, within 
that order, the chaotic hope of 
love. When I decided I wanted to 
be a writer myself, my mom gave 
me the writers I still consider my 
holy trinity: Alice Hoffman, Anne 
Tyler and Marisa de los Santos, 
whose stories give my world 
richness and texture. My mom is 
also the one who gave me “The 
Williamsburg Novels” by Elswyth 
Thane, our family heirloom.

I was maybe 14 at the time: 

cripplingly insecure, wild and 
determined to be misunderstood. 
My mom and I fought more than 
anything else, and I was convinced 
as only a teenager can be, without 
evidence or logic, that the world 
was ending before it had even 
begun. But when my mom gave 
me “Dawn’s Early Light,” the first 
in Thane’s series of seven novels, 
something shifted. The book was 
yellowed and falling apart at the 

seams, published in 1943 and long 
since out of print. It was written 
by a friend of my maternal great-
grandmother, and passed down 
from my grandmother to my mom 
to me.

The 
story 
was 
instantly 

addictive, a mix of history, 
romance and adventure. The 
series follows each generation of 
two families, the Spragues and 
the Days, from the American 
Revolution 
all 
the 
way 
up 

until World War II, which was 
happening as the books were 
being written. They aren’t perfect 
by any means; even at 14, I was 
old enough to know that the pre-

civil rights, pre-feminist portrait 
of the American South they 
offered was revisionistic at best 
and blatantly offensive at worst. 
But I was hooked, and I couldn’t 
be unhooked. The characters 
felt real to me, and in a way 
mythological, archetypes for the 
people I wanted to be and wanted 
to be with. The men were dashing, 
chivalrous, passionate; the women 
were precocious, brave and had 
moxie coming out of their ears. 
At 14, there was nothing I wanted 
in the world more than moxie. 
There’s nothing I want more now.

Just 
as 
the 
books 
drew 

generational 
lines 
through 

American history, they helped me 

find the thread between myself 
and the women who had come 
before me. I could picture Thane 
giving the books to my great-
grandmother, a woman who was 
vivacious, popular and college-
educated long before education for 
women was the norm. At the same 
time, she was also cold and sharp-
edged, and probably wouldn’t 
have chosen motherhood if she 
had lived in an era that gave her 
that choice. I could picture the 
books moving through the hands 
of my grandmother, whose life 
was as marked by adventure 
and tragedy as any of the book’s 
characters, who I remember as 
unfailingly lovely.

More than anything, I could 

picture my mom reading the 
books at my age. She looks like 
me at 14, but brighter, prettier. 
She is as uncertain as me, and as 
lonely, and as hopeful. An only-
child raised by a single mom, 
she dreams her way into this 
fiction of a big, devoted family of 
siblings and cousins, uncles and 
aunts, white Christmases. I like 
to think that when she met my 
dad a few years later, my mom 
saw in him the grand romance 
that she saw in the men of those 
books.

At 14, “The Williamsburg 

Novels” gave me a way to see 
my mom as more than the tense 
stranger she sometimes seemed. 
They gave me a way to see in her a 
shadow of myself, to see the ways 
we were both echoes of what had 
come before us. When she gave 
me those books, she gave me a 
piece of herself, a mythology that 
we and our grandmothers and 
our great-grandmothers could 
all live inside together. Someday, 
I hope I have a daughter. When I 
give her these books, I hope that 
she sees in them all the women 
who love her.

The more things change, the 

more things stay the same. As 
spring teases that it may be just 
around the corner here in Ann 
Arbor, out in the nation, the various 
great institutions of classical music 
have been, one by one, making their 
2018–2019 seasons known — and 
while one type of season may look 
like it’ll soon be in bloom, another 
is turning out to be distressingly 
grey.

One metric I use when judging 

a given organization’s concert 
season tends to end up being the 
amount of new music they include 
in their program. Of course, this 
is an element of my own bias 
(I’m a composer, sue me), but I 
also genuinely believe that it can 
serve as a helpful barometer of an 
institution’s artistic vibrancy. If 
you aren’t programming any new 
work, more often than not you 
aren’t having any new ideas — and 
at that point, why bother with it at 
all?

But 
a 
subset 
of 
this 

consideration, due to historical 
factors, usually ends up being 
the quantity of composers from 
either 
minority 
or 
otherwise 

disadvantaged 
backgrounds 

(read: not European-descended 
males). 
As 
it 
unfortunately 

seems to be necessary every 
year, this discussion reemerged 
a week ago, prompted this time 
by the announcement of the 
Metropolitan Opera’s 2018–2019 
season, a depressing catalogue 
of 27 operas that, improbably yet 
unsurprisingly, includes a grand 
total of zero women composers.

One of the most disheartening 

things about the whole affair 
is perhaps that, not only does 
the season do a disservice to 
the neglected composers, it also 
does a disservice to the art-going 
public. Setting aside the fact that 
you should include a more diverse 
range of artists because, say, it’s 
the right thing to do, it’s also an 
artistic imperative. You can only 
gain so much by hearing Wagner’s 
tetralogy for the 500th time. You’re 
never going to expand the art form 
by just rearranging the furniture 
and hoping the light catches the 
sofa in an interesting new way. 
You have to reupholster the couch. 
You have to buy a new one. Maybe 
even hire an interior decorator, 
if you’re feeling ambitious — but 
do something. And it would be 
almost 
inconceivable 
for 
that 

something to not include women 
composers: After all, in the words 
of The New Yorker’s Alex Ross, 
“any serious consideration of the 
music of our time would have to 
include a large number of women.” 
Even looking back at The Met’s 

own recent history provides an 
excellent example of an innovative 
and boundary-pushing woman 
composer — in 2016 the company 
produced 
Kaija 
Saariaho’s 

“L’amour de loin,” a stunning work 
which I had the good fortune to 
review at the time. Shortly after 
the season which included the 
Saariaho was announced, The New 
York Times ran an article entitled 
“Met to Stage Its First Opera by 
a Woman Since 1903,” which, if 
nothing else, should give a clue as 
to how frustratingly rare this sort 
of thing is.

Of course, one also has to take 

into account the cultural moment. 
I doubt it’s escaped anyone’s notice 

that we’re in the middle of the 
#MeToo phenomenon, and that’s 
probably an element of why this 
particular season announcement is 
getting so much attention. Artistic 
pillars have sometimes liked to 
think of themselves as residing 
somewhere outside the political 
and social fray, but honestly, one 
can’t really look at this season, in 
this moment, without thinking 
that it comes off as rather tone deaf, 
especially given the fact that The 
Met’s own James Levine recently 
had his past catch up with him. 
Granted, planning an opera season 
is a lot of work and takes months 
upon months to pull together, so 
The Met can’t really be faulted 
for the specific sin of lacking 
timeliness. But the general trend is 
certainly fair game.

The Met certainly isn’t alone in 

this. If the organization regarded 
as America’s opera company par 
excellence got it about as wrong 
as you can this year (a production 
of 
Nico 
Muhly’s 
new 
opera 

“Marnie” is its one saving grace), 
it had company. Orchestras and 
opera companies from Chicago to 
Houston join it in its pitfall, failing 
to program female composers 
with a frequency matched only 
by a similar failure with respect 
to 
composers 
from 
minority 

backgrounds.

There are of course exceptions, 

examples which could be used 
as a template for a way forward. 

One is fortunately in our own 
neighborhood. 
The 
Detroit 

Symphony 
Orchestra 
has 

programmed a promising array 
of new music, including much 
by female composers. Detroit, 
however, pales in comparison to 
the undisputed leader of the large-
scale new music scene, the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic.

A look at the City of Angels’ 

orchestra should be enough to 
make any competitor blush with 
embarrassment. There simply isn’t 
comparison — L.A. is a veritable 
cornucopia of new music. Last 
year a no less notable member of 
New York’s cultural commanding 
heights than The Times turned 
its coat to proclaim the L.A. Phil 
“the most important orchestra 
in America. Period.” High praise 
from the paper of record, but 
certainly not unwarranted. Over 
the last 15 years or so the orchestra 
has rocketed to new heights, 
notably under the leadership of 
a woman, Deborah Borda, who 
was last year snagged by the New 
York Philharmonic to be their 
president and CEO, just as Ann 
Arbor’s University Musical Society 
snagged 
the 
Philharmonic’s 

Matthew VanBesien. L.A. offers a 
constructive and innovative model 
for any forward-thinking musical 
organization to emulate, an aim 
which sooner or later, I suspect, 
will end up being existential.

If music is to be — as its most 

strident champions assert — the 
universal language, it has to do 
better with speaking in a universal 
voice. You can’t seriously expect 
the 
umpteenth 
symphony 
of 

the umpteenth dead Austrian to 
necessarily speak to the soul of 
someone whose ancestors were 
put into chains by someone who 
looked a lot like the old maestro. 
To have a universal appeal it has to 
draw from universal sources, and 
that means programming works by 
people who the canon left behind.

But more than that, if classical 

music is to have a future — and I 
assume that’s the idea — then it 
indisputably has to lie in the hands 
of the young, and the young aren’t 
going to put up with this for much 
longer. I’m not saying that the great 
masterworks should be thrown 
onto the ash heap of history, but if 
organizations keep trying to reburn 
the same classics without adding 
more wood to the fire, an ash heap 
is what they’ll get. Of course, no 
amount of admonishment from the 
sort of semi-professional opinion-
giver who writes columns in The 
Michigan Daily is going to change 
all of this. But an ocean is made of 
individual drops, and, well, you 
know the rest.

CONCERT REVIEW

The story 

was instantly 

addictive, a mix of 

history, romance 

and adventure

It’s the year 1996, and everything 

sucks. At least, that’s what Netflix’s 
latest 
coming-of-age 
dramedy 

is trying to prove. And with 
unrequited high school crushes, 
embarrassing parents and the 
unmistakable angst of adolescence, 
it’s doing a pretty convincing job.

Taking place in Boring, Oreg. — 

a real-life town whose unfortunate 
name is a heavy-handed motif in 
the series — “Everything Sucks” 
centers around the coming together 
of the town high school’s AV and 
drama clubs. The main characters, 
at least in the premiere episode, are 
Kate Messner (Peyton Kennedy, 
“Odd Squad”) and Luke O’Neil 
(Jahi Winston, “Proud Mary”), the 
former a sophomore struggling 
with both her sexuality and the 
fact that her father is the principal, 
the latter a baby-faced freshman 
tasked with finding his way in a 
new school.

They are a charming pair, 

with an instant bond that is only 
strengthened by the fact that 
both are being raised by single 
parents, which may hint at a future 
romantic plotline. Yet even with 
these fantastic young actors and a 
relatable, if not overdone concept, 
“Everything Sucks” fails to get off 

to a fantastic start.

It’s certainly not the cast. Luke’s 

two best friends Tyler (Quinn 
Liebling “Halfway House”) and 
McQuaid (Rio Mangini “Teen 

Wolf”) are the typical combination 
of the goofy and pessimistic 
sidekicks that add a healthy level 
of banter-humor to the show 
straight from the start. Beyond 
the freshman, drama club duo 
Oliver (Elijah Stevenson, “Captain 
Fantastic”) and Emaline (Sydney 
Sweeney, “The Handmaid’s Tale”) 
easily fall into the tropes of the too-
cool grunge guy and the blonde-
haired mean girl as soon as the 
second episode. Each character 
represents a different sort of 
outsider in high school, and it will 
no doubt be exciting to watch how 
they each fit into and work off of 
each other.

Yet, based off of the first episode, 

you might not want to make it that 
far. At first glance, “Everything 
Sucks” doesn’t seem like anything 
special. It absolutely could be, but 
the pilot tries too hard to deploy the 
’90s nostalgia that permeates every 
scene. Luke receives an Oasis album 
in the mail, Oliver has a meltdown 
over his broken Kurt Cobain glasses 
(see: clout goggles) and every girl 

dons a distressed flannel over the 
T-shirt of a band that stopped 
making music at least seven years 
ago. The second episode is even 
named 
after 
a 
“Wonderwall” 

lyric, and the now-infamous Oasis 
anthem makes an appearance in a 
tender moment between Luke and 
Kate.

As it did with the 80s-packed 

references of “Stranger Things,” 
Netflix wants to reach out to their 
audience using a retired culture 
that once was all they knew. But 
you need more than a throwback 
soundtrack 
and 
some 
niche 

references to create a solid show, 
and “Everything Sucks” struggles 
to get off to a good start.

That’s not to say that the show 

is not worth a watch. Luckily, 
it finds its footing immediately 
after the pilot episode, as central 
conflicts both between characters 
and within them are introduced. 
The 
nostalgia-packed 
episodes 

capture the uncomfortable and 
awkward institution that is high 
school and sets it all to a mix of 
Alanis Morissette and Nirvana. 
“Everything 
Sucks” 
can 
be 

enjoyable, but you are just going to 
have to keep watching to get to that 
point. Until then, I’d recommend 
kicking back with a No Doubt album 
and some Burger King chicken 
fries, because there are some things 
only #90skids understand.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Friday, February 23, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

The first time I heard Phoebe 

Bridgers’s music, I was entranced. 
I’m a longtime fan of Ryan Adams’s 
Pax-Am Records: When Bridgers’s 
first EP Killer was released on the 
label, I fell head-over-heels in love 
with her songs, her voice and the 
emotional investment her music 
creates in a listener. Though she 
and other artists like Julien Baker 
follow a wave of folk-nouveau 
(which is increasing in popularity), 
Bridgers has a very unique take 
on the genre: a perfect mix of 
poignantly 
simple 
songwriting 

and 
layered 
production 
that 

fuses storytelling tradition with 
a modern edge, lodging itself in 
your brain like an earworm for 
months on end. She’s one of those 
artists that represents something 
more than just herself — Bridgers 
is evidence of a shifting change in 
popular music towards complete 
authenticity, proudly wearing her 
heart on her sleeve. Adams himself 
has even compared her to a young 
Bob Dylan.

“In the end,” Bridgers said in a 

recent phone interview with The 
Michigan Daily, “I’ll always write 
what I feel.”

Bridgers spoke with me about 

this singular authenticity, her 
creative process and how the 
songs she’s written have changed 
throughout time. The transition 
from her EP to last year’s critically 
acclaimed album Stranger in the 
Alps was a big one, a shift between 
bare-bones voice and guitar to a 
more fully produced sound.

“Contrary to popular belief, I 

met Ryan (Adams), who produced 
the EP, and Tony (Berg), who 
produced the album in the same 
week … We started both at the 
same time, but the Ryan thing 
kind of felt like he was recording 
me in his wheelhouse, which is 
really simple kind of folk acoustic, 
and the album was just me,” she 
explained. “That’s what I sound 
like.”

While recording the album, 

Bridgers and Berg fought to strike 
a balance between production and 
Bridgers’s musical style, forming a 
strong partnership in the process. 
“I’m the kind of artist who needs 
a producer, and he brought so 
much to the table,” Bridgers said. 
“We fought a lot, but the middle 
ground we would reach was like ... 
perfect.”

“It’s exactly like I wanted it 

to sound, but I could have never 
imagined it sounding like that, if 

that makes sense,” she continued. 
This unique sound carries her 
incredible 
lyrics 
masterfully, 

touching on topics like depression, 
heartbreak and death with grace 
and honesty. I asked her whether 
this attention to heavier subject 
matter was a purely creative choice 
or more tangled with her own 
experiences while writing.

“I obviously don’t want to be 

pigeonholed as an artist who only 
writes sad songs,” she answered, 
“but the truth is for this album 
that’s what I was going through 
and feeling, so I just want to tell 
the truth and hold up my end of the 
conversation.”

For the most part, Bridgers 

finds sharing her own stories to 
be cathartic, but occasionally 
has trouble with the highly 
personal nature of her songs while 
performing and writing with 
others.

“When it’s a crowd of people 

who come to see me, I know that 
they know this one album, so it’s 
great, but then when I open for 
people I have this weird guilt, 
where I’m like ‘Oh God, I’m about 
to ruin the mood,’” she said. “I 
sometimes write with friends, and 
that’s sometimes hard because I 
have to explain all these things like, 
‘Yeah, I really hate this person, but 
I also have these other conflicting 
feelings.’ It’s hard to put those 
ideas into words, so it’s difficult — 
I don’t put half the things I think 
about on paper.”

Despite 
this, 
the 
singer-

songwriter 
is 
committed 
to 

sharing her own story through 
her music, saying she thinks “the 
importance of (her) music is to 
process and share whatever (she’s) 
going through personally, and how 
that relates to other people.”

Bridgers consistently maintains 

a certain ingenuity, even when 
collaborating with other artists 
or trying new ways to approach 
writing her music. She has always 
found a niche in expressing herself, 
a natural truth that shows up 
deeply in her music: “I think, it’s 
always kind of been easy for me 
to do that, maybe at some point it 
won’t be, but I’ve always thought 
that what I had to bring to the 
table, someone would think was 
cool.” She has now worked with 
people from Adams to longtime 
hero Conor Oberst (who appears 
in the duet “Would You Rather” on 
Stranger), she sees them as a great 
inspiration for her own career.

“I meet people — especially 

growing up in LA — heroes that 
I’m disappointed by all the time. 
They’re just a dick or whatever,” 
she laughed. “But these are the 
kinds of people I want to be around, 
that they’ve always been true to 
themselves and real. They’re really 
inspiring to me on so many levels 
— the fact that you can make such 
great music and be a good person. 
I feel like I really needed in my 
life, and I love being around it. It 
inspires me to write more and all 
kinds of stuff.”

She has grown more comfortable 

with collaborating with artists she

MUSIC ALBUM REVIEW

For nearly seven years between 

1995 and 2001, Michael Jackson 
went quiet. He released two 
compilation albums with a few 
new one-off tracks, but the waiting 
time for a follow-up album to 
the 1995 release of HIStory was 
unusually long — especially for a 
pop star that continually released 
material since age six. So when 
Invincible released in Oct. of 2001, 
Michael Jackson was expected to 
make a monumental Thriller-esque 
comeback. However, the album 
was unlike any album in Jackson’s 
discography — it’s vindictive, 
assertive and disheveled, reflecting 
the mental state of one of music’s 
most famous stars. Invincible, in 
hindsight, offers a rare glimpse 
behind the curtain of pop music’s 
ever-present label executives and 
publicists to reveal soundbites of 
Jackson’s deterioration.

Aside 
from 
the 
pressure 

of 
arguably 
the 
biggest 
fan 

base of all time, Jackson was 
returning to the charts with 
Invincible after widespread media 
coverage regarding alleged child 
molestation. His life had been more 
public than ever before — his house 
was invaded, his marriage failed 
and a police strip-search revealed 
detailed descriptions of his private 
parts on an international level. 
Regardless of the legitimacy of his 
charges (which were dismissed at 
the time), Jackson was the center 
of international media scrutiny.

In 
retrospect, 
considering 

Jackson’s turmoil, Invincible is 
exactly the album he wanted to 
release. It’s unapologetically angry, 
with heavy electronic production 
and vocal distortion that veers far 
from early 2000s pop influences. 
The opening track “Unbreakable” 
slaps listeners in the face with its 
wall of sound; there’s a growling 
lion, syncopated piano and heavy 

808s repeated in a short loop 
that feels militaristic. Jackson 
lets this beat saturate listeners’ 
ears for almost a minute before 
coming in with more grit than ever 
before questioning, “Now I’m just 
wondering why you think / That 
you can get to me with anything?” 
Perhaps to combat his alleged 
molestation 
charges, 
Jackson 

is uber-macho, even featuring 

a Notorious B.I.G. feature on 
“Unbreakable” in what feels like an 
attempt at hypermasculinity.

However, this machismo divides 

the album. The first three tracks 
(“Unbreakable,” 
“Heartbreaker” 

and “Invincible”) follow a similar 
trend of dense production and 
bitter lyricism, but there’s also 
jarring pockets of familiar, yet 
boring, Jackson ballads. “Break 
of Dawn” opens with bird noises 
and “The Lost Children” features 
sampled audio of children playing 
— an odd dichotomy of the well-
known and soft-spoken Jackson 
versus one that is bitter and 
aggressive.

Somewhere in the middle, 

there’s a glimpse of Jackson as 
a true R&B artist that’s neither 
angry or bashful. “You Rock 

My World” is what I’d expect a 
well-seasoned, adult pop star to 
sound like late in his career — it’s 
light-hearted and mature while 
remaining innovative. Produced 
by Darkchild (Destiny’s Child’s 
“Say My Name” and Brandy and 
Monica’s “The Boy Is Mine”) and 
featuring ad-libs from comedian 
Chris Tucker, “You Rock My 
World” perfectly embodied the 
growing sound of early 2000s 
R&B. Darkchild’s signature bass 
and string production would later 
dominate the 2000s with Destiny’s 
Child, Lady Gaga and Justin 
Bieber. Jackson feels sincere — he 
doesn’t sound vocally strained, 
as he stays in a more achievable 
range, singing about courting a 
lover. “You Rock My World” was 
Jackson’s last number one to top 
the charts during his lifetime and, 
looking back, that makes sense. It 
was exactly what fans wanted — 
something fresh and innovative 
that didn’t stray too far from the 
Jackson they knew and loved, 
sounding like an updated “The 
Way You Make Me Feel” but for 
the 2000s.

The 
more 
interesting 
(and 

likely more genuine) parts of 
Invincible are those that are brash, 
showcasing a side of Jackson 
the public never saw. Invincible’s 
disjointed, sometimes contrasting 
flow is why the album is required 
listening — never before had a 
mega star released an album 
that lacked pristine calculation 
and allowed genuine insight into 
an 
artist’s 
psyche. 
Invincible, 

although largely forgotten by fans, 
is Jackson at his most earnest and, 
coincidentally, his last body of 
work. In the years after Invincible, 
Jackson would face another child 
molestation charge and spiral 
deeper into controversy (like 
dangling his child over a balcony) 
that prevented any further studio 
albums, suggesting that Invincible 
offered fans a warning of his future 
decline. 

MUSIC NOTEBOOOK
An overlooked gem from 
one of pop’s biggest stars

DANIEL MADION

Daily Arts Writer

In retrospect, 

considering 

Jackson’s turmoil, 

Invincible is 

exactly the album 

he wanted to 

release

has admired for a long time, saying 
“I was intimidated at first, and 
now I feel way more comfortable, 
like there’s a reason I’m in this 
room, you know? It feels good.”

Bridgers has evolved quite 

a bit throughout the process of 
recording and now touring for 
Stranger in the Alps, expanding her 
horizons by translating the album’s 
music into live performance for 
the first time. She has now toured 
with several artists including 
Oberst, Julien Baker and will open 
for Bon Iver on two dates during 
her current foray across the United 
States and Canada. I asked her 
about the process of performing 
live and creating different versions 
of her songs through touring.

“There’s 
so 
many 
things 

happening 
at 
once 
on 
the 

album,” she answered. “There’s a 
million instruments; it feels very 
produced, which is a very weird 
thing to say about my music. I 
think that in trying (to replicate 
the recording), we’ve created 
live versions. So we try to make 
it sound like the recording, but if 
it’s not exactly the same, it’s in the 
same vein.”

Bridgers also elaborated on 

her recent experiences touring, 
sharing a story about one of the 
songs off the album.

“I 
still 
get 
nervous,” 
she 

admitted. “I do this thing now 
where I sing ‘You Missed My 
Heart,’ which is this very slow, 
very long, sad song, but I don’t 
play an instrument on it, so the 
first night I got really nervous. 
There’s piano happening, but I’m 
not playing anything, and have 
nothing to do with my hands,” she 
laughed, “but we were at this club 
where I couldn’t hear the monitor, 
so I ended up sitting down, and 
listening to the monitors close to 
the floor. People totally thought it 
was on purpose and like, badass, 
so for the next couple of shows I 
decided to do that, and it was really 
different.”

Bridgers acknowledges her own 

growth as a performer during live 
shows, getting out of her comfort 
zone by trying new things on stage 
throughout the tour: “I’m not a 
huge ‘stage presence’ person, I just 
kind of stand there,” she laughed 
again. “I can barely tap my foot 
without going out of time on the 
guitar, so I’m trying to step out 
of my comfort zone, but it doesn’t 
feel disingenuous, like ‘People do 
this! People do this, right? I can do 
this!’”

This spunky edge and focus on 

self-realization is something that 
sets Bridgers apart from the crowd 

— she’s genuinely funny, carrying a 
well-defined sense of dark humor 
that shows up even in her saddest 
songs. Even the album’s title is an 
inside joke, a nod to the TV re-dub 
of cult classic movie “The Big 
Lebowski.”

“It’s the scene where Walter 

is screaming at this kid, and he 
says ‘This is what happens when 
you fuck a stranger in the ass,’” 
she explained, “but the TV edit is 
‘This is what happens when you 
find a stranger in the alps,’ which 
is the strangest quote ever, and I 
just thought it sounded so pseudo-
poetic and thought it really 
represented my personality and 
my music in general.”

This balance between drama 

and the comedic intricacies and 
accidents of life is what makes 
Bridgers’s writing seem so real — 
it captures the humanity in life’s 
ups and downs with a beautifully 
poetic twist. She laughed when I 
brought this up, saying something 
I don’t think I’ll ever forget: “I’m 
not entirely like smoking a clove 
cigarette in the corner of a fucking 
coffee shop right now, but I’m also 
not doing stand up comedy; I’m 
doing this.”

‘M’ strategizes for Arizona State

September 15 was a day of 

firsts for the Michigan hockey 
team.

It was the opening practice 

for the 2017-18 campaign. It was 
the beginning of Mel Pearson’s 
tenure at the helm. And it was the 
first look at a group determined 
to rebound after a lackluster 
season and restore prestige to 
one of college hockey’s most 
storied programs.

More than halfway through 

the year, the Wolverines were 
unranked with an 8-10-2 record. 
An NCAA Tournament berth was 
far from the realm of possibility. 
But since Jan. 7, Michigan has 
gone 8-3-1 with three sweeps 
of top-15 teams, including No. 1 
Notre Dame last weekend, and 
risen to No. 13 in the USCHO 
poll.

Through 
trials 
and 

tribulations over the past five 
months, 
the 
nation’s 
third-

youngest team has positioned 
itself for a postseason run.

Following the two wins over 

the Fighting Irish, the Wolverines 
(16-13-3) sit at No. 11 in the 
PairWise rankings and third 
place in the Big Ten standings. 
Michigan is guaranteed home-
ice advantage in the first round of 
the conference tournament, and 
College Hockey News gives it a 
95-percent chance of qualifying 
for the NCAA Tournament.

Since Sept. 15, there have 

been questions about every facet 
of its game — offense, defense, 
special teams and goaltending. 
But many were answered this 
past month, and the Wolverines 
have survived the gauntlet of 
Big Ten powerhouses, looking 
more complete than they have all 
season.

Now, Michigan is one regular-

season series from beginning its 
chase for postseason glory.

The one team standing in 

the Wolverines’ way? Arizona 
State (8-19-5), a program in 
just its third year of Division I 
hockey and No. 55 of 60 teams 
in PairWise. On paper, the Sun 
Devils hardly seem a threat for 
a Michigan team with so much 
momentum.

After 
running 
full 
speed 

since September, additional rest 
in advance of next weekend’s 
looming Big Ten Tournament 
would be smart. Taking it easy 

before being thrown into high-
level matchups in the NCAA 
Tournament 
makes 
sense. 

Especially with the season’s last 
games against a bottom-feeder 
in Arizona State, a team at which 
some wouldn’t bat an eye.

But a loss or two against the 

lowly Sun Devils would instantly 
erase the Wolverines’ second-
half 
turnaround. 
Compiling 

recent victories over top teams 
to be an arm’s length from 
returning to the playoffs would 
all be for naught.

At this point, the implications 

are 
known 
for 
a 
weekend 

that, on the surface, once felt 
like an afterthought on the 
calendar compared to series 
against 
previous 
conference 

heavyweights.

“We have to treat Arizona 

State like a No. 1 team,” said 
junior 
defenseman 
Joseph 

Cecconi Tuesday. “If we don’t 
beat them twice, that’s going to 
hurt us big time in the PairWise. 
We have to prepare basically 
just like any other game, any 
other Big Ten game. It might be 
these two games are the most 
important for our season.”

***
Despite the high stakes of 

this weekend felt by players, the 
length and strain of the past five 
months remains the reality — 
something Pearson strives to put 
into perspective.

“This time of the year, you 

have to be careful with how 
much you’re putting them on 
the ice,” Pearson said after 
Tuesday’s skate-around. “… It’s 
a long season. It’s all about the 
games and having the energy for 
the games right now, so we’re 
going a little lighter.”

Coming 
down 
the 

homestretch, 
Michigan 
has 

taken two days off each week 
instead 
of 
the 
usual 
one. 

Following Sunday night’s win 
against the Fighting Irish, there 
was an off-day Monday and just a 
half-hour skate Tuesday “to get a 
light sweat.”

Even without formal practices 

some days, Pearson still makes 
sure to coach off the ice. 
Realizing the physical toll on 
a skater’s body throughout the 
season, he demands his players 
take a much-needed — and well-
deserved — break.

Pearson stresses they get 

schoolwork done on off-days 
and eight-plus hours of sleep. He 

constantly reminds them about 
the “sleep-rest ratio” and shares 
articles about the importance of 
recovery.

“I wish the coach followed 

the same advice he’s giving his 
players,” Pearson joked. “I’m not 
adhering to the eight hours, but I 
don’t have to play.”

Though nearing the end of 

the regular season, practice 
objectives are the same — focus 
on individuals early in the week, 
then turn the attention to the 
upcoming opponent.

While the early days leading 

into a weekend series are usually 
for studying film and ironing 
out kinks in players’ games, this 
week emphasized rest.

“We want to keep ourselves 

fresh and ready to go,” Cecconi 
said. “The coaching staff knows 
what they’re doing. They’re not 
going to burn us out or they’re 
not going to skate us too little or 
too much. We just kind of follow 
their lead and still work hard.”

***
One-hundred and sixty days 

ago, Michigan began its trek to 
the NCAA Tournament, which it 
missed last season.

After months of practice and 

preparation, the Wolverines now 
find themselves two games away 
from carrying out the task that 
once looked overly daunting.

Taking 
a 
break 
may 
be 

necessary, but Michigan won’t 
lose sight of the work that 
originally got it to this place. 
Intense conference play may 
have ended with an impressive 
showing against Notre Dame, 
but “the highs won’t get too 
high,” according to Cecconi. This 
won’t be a down week or a week 
to celebrate past victories.

“It’s a little less workload,” 

Pearson said. “But we want to 
stay sharp at the same time.”

Prematurely looking to the 

playoffs and resting for the 
possibly long road ahead is 
important, but the Wolverines 
won’t look past Arizona State, a 
team with nothing to lose, poised 
to play spoiler at Yost Ice Arena.

“This weekend is big,” Cecconi 

said. “If we don’t do what we 
need to do, then last weekend 
doesn’t matter.”

Should 
Michigan 
play 

flatly 
and 
the 
Sun 
Devils 

take advantage, all the work 
since Sept. 15 to return to the 
postseason will most likely go to 
waste.

Wolverines still need Matthews

At last, Charles Matthews found 

himself a good look.

With the Wolverines down by 

two in the second half, the redshirt 
junior guard cut to the basket and 
flashed his arm up for the ball. The 
Penn State defender swung around 
into position, and Matthews pump-
faked. The shot went up. Off the rim. 
He ripped down his own rebound. 
Another layup went up. It crawled 
off the hoop again.

The 
sequence 
would 
be 

Matthews’ last chance to convert 
on a night he simply couldn’t 
buy a bucket. He was bottled up 
offensively, struggled to pick his 
spots and finished the game with 
a towel draped over his head as he 
watched the rest of the Michigan 
men’s basketball team pull away 
from Penn State on Wednesday.

He’d finish with zero points for 

the first time this season.

“Charles is not playing with 

confidence,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein afterwards. “I think 
right now he’s probably, as we’re 
coaching him, thinking too much.”

Three turnovers in the game’s 

first 15 minutes probably didn’t help 
that.

On 
the 
Wolverines’ 
second 

possession, Matthews drove from 
the corner and lost control of the 
ball as defenders collapsed. He was 
pick-pocketed minutes later and, 
finally, just before the under-four 
timeout, Matthews would again 
lose his dribble in a swarm of white 
jerseys.

That’s been Matthews’ turnover 

equation all year: the aggressiveness 
that makes him such a strong 
slasher backfires as he gets loose 
with the ball.

And when those issues came 

back Wednesday night, Matthews 
found himself sitting to start the 
second half in favor of freshman 
guard Jordan Poole — a rare, mid-
game lineup adjustment for Beilein. 
 

“I’m watching Charles right now, 

and he had three turnovers the 
other day, and he started out the first 
half with three turnovers,” Beilein 

said. “Not all of them were his fault, 
but he’s just not confident right now 
(with) just about anything.

“There are times where he gets 

himself into tough spots. And we got 
to teach him to ease his game a little 
bit just to make simple plays.”

That “simple play” mindset has 

fueled the reemergence of Poole, 
who went 4-of-8 with 13 points in 
26 minutes — many of which came 
ahead of Matthews.

For the second straight game, 

Poole gave an immediate boost 
to 
Michigan’s 
offense. 
That 

included 
SportsCenter’s 
“Top 

Play” of Wednesday — an and-one 
posterization of 6-foot-10 Nittany 
Lions’ forward Julian Moore.

But Poole’s biggest moment of 

the night came on a more mundane 
play. With just over seven minutes 
to go, Poole doubled the Wolverines’ 
lead with a flick of the wrist from 
deep in the corner, cutting much 
of the momentum Penn State built 
with a furious start to the half. 

“What Jordan Poole is giving us 

right now is really good,” Beilein 
said. “That 3 in the left corner was 
huge for us. He just gives us that 
extra shooter out there.”

While 
Beilein 
admits 
that 

Poole certainly has room to grow, 
Wednesday’s 
performance 
was 

another example of the calmer, 
more cerebral style he’s developed 
during Big Ten play. Yes, he still 
drives Beilein crazy with the 

occasional alley-oop and heat-check 
shot, but it’s clear that Poole has 
become more calculated with the 
ball.

“I’ve been making simple plays 

knowing that the ball is going to 
come back to you, and you don’t 
have to go out there and force every 
shot,” Poole said. “I’m being more 
patient and trying to find the best 
possible shot we can get.”

While Poole can fill in for spurts, 

he isn’t Michigan’s final answer 
opposite senior guard Muhammed-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman — or at least 
not yet.

That’s still Matthews, as it was 

during non-conference play when 
he led the Wolverines in scoring.

“He won a lot of games for us 

early in the year,” Beilein said. “But 
right now, it’s not fair to the other 
guys when he’s not playing with the 
same swagger that he had earlier.”

But hope isn’t lost — even amidst 

a five-game stretch when Matthews 
has averaged just 6.4 points-per-
game. 
Beilein 
has 
instructed 

Matthews to take shots after 
practice, watch extra film and pay 
special attention to making the right 
pass.

It hasn’t materialized recently 

like it has for Poole. Still, Matthews 
is essential for Michigan, and even 
through struggles, his coach knows 
it.

“We’re trying to get him back 

because we need him,” Beilein said.

Tourney Bound

There are two types of heroes: 

Those you expect and those that 
come from nowhere. Michigan 
found both on Thursday.

When the ball found senior 

guard Katelynn Flaherty, open 
in the corner with 2:35 to go in 
the game and the Wolverines 
clinging onto a 60-59 lead over 
Maryland, she did the same thing 
she’s done a million times before. 
She rose and hit it.

When the ball found Akienreh 

Johnson a minute later, the 
Terrapins having gotten the 
deficit back to two, the guard 
decided to get in on the action. 
Johnson, who was averaging just 
2.5 points per game coming into 
Thursday, fired one from deep. 
She hit it.

“The 
whole 
year, 
my 

teammates have been telling me, 
‘AK, just shoot it,’ ” the sophomore 
said. “So, I had to just shoot one.”

Though Maryland answered 

with a Kaila Charles layup, junior 
guard Nicole Munger converted 
a driving layup as she fell away 
from the basket to extend the 
Wolverines’ lead to 68-63 with 30 
seconds to go in the game.

That was when you knew. 

This was really going to happen. 
There would be no collapse, no 
lingering doubt on the way to 
Indianapolis, no tears a week 
from Monday when the selection 
show commences.

Michigan (10-6 Big Ten, 21-8 

overall) beat No. 13 Maryland (11-
4, 22-6), 71-65, on Senior Night 
and with the win, all but sealed 
the program’s first tournament 
berth since 2012-13 — before any 
current senior was on the roster 
— a year after being left out on the 
night of the selection show.

“Coming off the floor, coach 

(Kim Barnes) Arico said, ‘This 
better be the last one (at Crisler),’ ” 
Flaherty said. “To go to the NCAA 
Tournament, for the first time, our 

senior year, will be awesome.”

Added Barnes Arico: “I think 

our kids have put themselves in 
an incredible position. Last year, 
they said we didn’t have top-
50 wins. We have three top-25 
(wins) right now.”

As the clock hit zero, Johnson 

jumped 
into 
senior 
forward 

Jillian 
Dunston’s 
arms 
at 

midcourt.

“When the buzzer went off, 

when we finally won, I know the 
feeling that Kate and Jill have,” 
Johnson said, “because they 
worked so hard for this and so 
the win, just — it felt right to jump 
into her arms. There’s nothing 
(else) you could do, really.”

Johnson tied Flaherty to lead 

the team in scoring with 17, doing 
so on 8-of-11 shooting with eight 
rebounds. This in a game where 
she played more than her usual 
handful of minutes only because 
freshman forward Hailey Brown 
was out with an injury.

“I just think that right now, 

I’m not on anybody’s scout, so 
where they (can‘t) know what 
to do with me,” Johnson said. 
“So, I took advantage of that and 
I made myself open. And now, 
when I make myself open, it takes 
pressure off of everybody else.”

Michigan jumped out to an 

early lead, starting the affair with 
an 11-4 run bookended by a pull-
up triple from Flaherty. Though 
Maryland closed the gap to three, 
the Wolverines strung together 
an 8-2 run to close out the first 
quarter.

When the lead continued to 

build early in the second quarter, 
Michigan could feel it — not just 
the win, but all that came with it. 
March Madness was well within 
the Wolverines’ grasp.

Of course, it wasn’t that easy.
A layup from the Terrapins’ 

Ieshia 
Small 
cut 
Michigan’s 

lead to 10 with six minutes to 
go in the half. Over the next 
few minutes, 10 became six, six 
became one. Even after Munger 

hit a corner 3-pointer with just 
under two minutes left in the half 
to put the lead back to four, the 
Wolverines got sloppy. Flaherty 
turned the ball over taking it up 
the court when she passed into 
the teeth of what looked to be a 
half-court trap. After Stephanie 
Jones finished a layup with time 
running down, Michigan went 
into the half with the slimmest of 
35-33 leads.

What had been an impending 

blowout turned into a game where 
every missed shot clinked off the 
rim with an extra emphasis.

Maryland managed to tie it at 37 

early in the third with a mini 4-0 
run, but couldn’t take its first lead. 
Not for the rest of the quarter. Not 
for the rest of the game.

“Everything we worked on 

today is what we worked on 
the last three days of practice,” 
Barnes Arico said. “We throw the 
ball — like, I’ll have five people 
standing at half-court, throw the 
ball up, ‘A minute left in the game. 
What are we running? What are 
we in? What defense?’ We’re 
holding up defense, we have 
different people on the bench 
calling (instructions), ‘Okay, now 
what are we running? What are 
we doing on defense?’ Because 
that’s the game. And that’s where 
we needed to get better.”

That, the Wolverines did.

F

or one last time, Katelynn 
Flaherty and Jillian Dunston 
donned the maize and blue 

at Crisler 
Center.

Prior to 

the game on 
Senior Night, 
they were 
honored at 
center court. 
Surrounded 
by their 
families, 
Flaherty 
and Dunston each received framed 
jerseys. Though a rather simple 
and customary tradition, it was a 
nice way to celebrate two Michigan 
women’s basketball greats.

And while the two have certainly 

asserted themselves among the 
program’s best, their legacy, in part, 
hinged on the result of Thursday’s 
game against No. 13 Maryland.

While a win against one of 

the nation’s best teams would 
solidify the Wolverines’ NCAA 
Tournament chances, a loss would 
have put them on the bubble — and 
perhaps out of the Tournament.

But Michigan won the seniors, 

final regular season game, 71-65. 
And while it’s not a shoo-in, the 
Wolverines should earn a trip to the 
dance.

Going into Thursday, they 

had lost four of their last five. A 

team that seemed like a lock for 
the Tournament just a few weeks 
ago entered the game against 
Maryland barely clinging to their 
Tournament hopes.

Under the leadership of its 

seniors, Michigan prevailed. 
Despite leading the team in scoring, 
Flaherty had a rather pedestrian 
game by her standards, finishing 
with 17 points and four assists. 
She did hit a clutch 3-pointer with 
2:35 to go, though, putting the 
Wolverines up four.

Per usual, Dunston’s stat line was 

underwhelming – five points, seven 
rebounds and two steals. But her 
impact was felt on defense. Under 
Dunston’s leadership, Michigan 
held the Terrapins — who rank 
third in 3-point percentage and 
13th in offense nationally — to just 
65 points and 0-for-9 from behind 
the arc.

The win was the first time the 

seniors have beaten Maryland.

“It was double special for 

me,” Dunston said. “I grew up in 
Maryland, watching Maryland. 
(I was) a big fan of them. I wasn’t 
really recruited there, for us to beat 
them — they’re a nationally-touted 
team — at a time we really need to.”

The win should get Dunston and 

Michigan into the Tournament, as 
they now have three top-25 wins. 
But, at this point last year, it seemed 
that the Wolverines were locks for 
the Tournament.

“After what happened last year, 

I will not believe another thing, 
ever,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico. “We can go win the 
Big Ten Tournament, and I’ll be, 
‘Oh my gosh’ on Selection Monday.”

With Michigan’s last 

Tournament appearance coming 
in 2013, Flaherty and Dunston have 
never experienced March Madness.

So would missing this year’s 

Tournament, and therefore never 
qualifying, tarnish the legacy of the 
two seniors?

Not entirely, but it wouldn’t help.
The two still have much to be 

proud of.

Flaherty — a four-year starter — is 

arguably the best player in program 
history. The Point Pleasant, N.J. 
product has led the Wolverines in 
scoring each of her four seasons. Her 
proficiency on offense has left her 
with exactly 2,700 points – the most 
in program history. 

While Dunston doesn’t receive 

as much notoriety, her play is 
certainly imperative. Dunston is 
the voice of the team, always yelling 
out commands, energizing her 
team and playing with maximum 
effort. She does the little things that 
don’t necessarily show up in the 
box score. For the past two seasons, 
she has been the Wolverines’ best 
defender. She ranks third all-time 
in rebounds and 11th in steals. 

The stats speak for themselves.
In a video played on the 

scoreboard, Flaherty claimed her 
greatest memory was beating Ohio 
State in Columbus earlier this year. 
For Dunston, it was winning the 
WNIT Tournament last year.

But they both agreed, making 

a run in the NCAA Tournament 
would trump those memories. 

And Thursday’s win put them 

one step closer to making that a 
reality.

“This was so crucial to out 

NCAA bid,” Dunston said. “No one 
wins the WNIT and then goes back. 
You want to go to the tournament.”

Regardless of if they qualify for 

the Tournament or not, the legacy 
of their character alone makes them 
Michigan greats.

“What Jillian Dunston and 

Katelynn Flaherty have meant to 
our program, to the culture of our 
program, is just incredible,” Barnes 
Arico said. “The kind of people 
they are and the example they set 
for the players in our program, for 
the people in the community, for 
young girls out there aspiring to be 
college basketball players. They are 
Michigan kids. They are leaders 
and best.”
