University of Michigan student 

Dyshon Toxey doesn’t smile much 
anymore. 

An LSA senior, Toxey is finishing 

his degree in cognitive science 
and mathematics, and is involved 
in 
a 
number 
of 
development 

programs for fellow first-generation 
students. Toxey is Black, and said 
he often took pride in his perfectly 

straight, groomed set of teeth 
to build connections in Black 
circles and beyond — he’s known 
as a community mentor with an 
easygoing demeanor and an even 
easier smile. 

That is, he was until last April, 

when Toxey was detained, body 
slammed and handcuffed outside 
Hill 
Auditorium 
for 
alleged 

disorderly conduct at the SpringFest 
concert headlined by Migos.

Toxey recounted event staff 

asking him and his friends — all 
Black students — to fill in the front 
rows of the concert, then being 
asked by security guards to leave 

shortly thereafter. When a white 
Ann Arbor police officer attempted 
to grab ahold of him, Toxey, who 
admits he was intoxicated, said he 
panicked. 

“I ran,” he said. “There was 

no one to protect me, no one was 
videotaping. I really was not trying 
to get into an altercation.”

When Toxey came to a stop near 

the Panera on North University 
Avenue, he said the officer threw 
him to the ground and kneed him 
in the back, knocking a tooth out 
and spraining Toxey’s wrist in 
the process. Toxey said he was 
later transported to the University 

Hospital and released hours later, 
with stitches, crutches and a bill 
totaling nearly $7,000 in medical 
fees. The University’s Division of 
Public Security and Safety notes the 
case as closed in its crime log. Toxey, 
the report details, was taken to the 
emergency room for “treatment of 
injuries sustained during a fall when 
he was fleeing.”

Despite protests from his parents, 

Toxey didn’t inquire into his record; 
he wanted to brush the incident 
aside, take his final exams and 
return to his family and home in 
Harlem, New York. He said he was 
never notified about his charges 

again.

“(The cop) kept saying, ‘I told you 

not to run,’ ” Toxey said. “ ‘I told you 
not to run.’ And then I never heard 
anything from them again.” 

A few other Black students 

who were present at the concert 
corroborate Toxey’s account, but 
they agree on more than just his 
take on the night’s events. Toxey’s 
fate was not surprising to them. The 
Black community on campus and in 
Ann Arbor, many students claim, is 
more frequently and aggressively 
policed in student life than other 
demographics at the University. 
More stringent law enforcement, 
then, does little to close the gap 
between 
Black 
students’ 
lives 

outside of the classroom and 
mainstream perceptions of the 
glorified Michigan experience.

Many lament that few qualifiers 

can spare Black students, especially 
Black men. For all of LSA freshman 
Rashan 
Gary’s 
acclaim 
as 
a 

highly recruited defensive tackle 
on the football team, he said he 
witnessed 
similar 
stereotyping 

while interviewing an Ann Arbor 
Police Department officer for a class 
project on community relations. 
The cop said, if he had seen Gary, 
6’5” feet tall and 287 pounds, on the 
street late at night without context, 
he’d have reason to be scared.

“He was straight up about it, that 

I could be dangerous or something,” 
Gary said.

The suspicion is then often 

institutionalized. As recently as 
two weeks ago, in a carjacking case 
in downtown Ann Arbor, AAPD 
Detective Lt. Matt Lige told MLive 
the suspect was described as “a 
light-skinned black male.” The 
department arrested a white 17 year 
old for the crime three days later.

Elizabeth 
James, 
program 

associate director of the Department 
of 
Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies, pointed to the mistaken 
identity case as a microcosm of 
larger systemic issues in local forces. 
The discrepancy in policing, she 
said, is something she’s been aware 
of since she began working in Ann 
Arbor in the early ’90s.

“What do we do with our tall men 

… or our darker men?” she asked. 

“There’s a double consciousness for 
Black students that’s always resting 
on your shoulder. Your party’s going 
to be shut down … even when it’s in 
the (Michigan) Union. You’ve got to 
walk more delicately, and you have 
to be twice as good.” 

I. The Danger in Numbers
In the years since Michael 

Brown’s death at the hands of a 
police officer in Ferguson, Mo., 
police 
departments 
across 
the 

country have come under fire for 
both aggressive tactics and racial 
disparity. A New York Times study 
in 2015 found white representation 
in hundreds of police forces across 
the country is up to more than 30 
percentage points higher than their 
community’s proportion of white 
residents.

Ann Arbor wasn’t spared from 

the slew of fatal police shootings. In 
2014, a Black woman named Aura 
Rosser, who suffered from mental 
health issues, was killed by white 
AAPD officer David Ried — county 
prosecutors later refused to indict 
Ried for what officials deemed 
lawful self-defense. Rosser’s death 
sparked protests and prompted 
AAPD to mandate body cameras 
and diversity training, but the force 
hasn’t yet collected data on whether 
its demographics have shifted. As of 
the last Bureau of Justice Statistics 
survey in 2013, 82.8 percent of sworn 
AAPD officers were white, more 
than 10 percent higher than the 
percentage of Ann Arbor residents 
who were white.

At 
the 
University, 
police 

demographics 
bear 
striking 

resemblance to national trends. 
White officers and staff members 
represent 78.1 percent of DPSS, 
which includes University Police, 
Housing 
Security, 
Michigan 

Medicine Security and general 
Security Services. Only 10.7 percent 
of DPSS is Black, while 4.6 percent is 
Latino. Furthermore, the division is 
overwhelmingly male, with women 
making up just 32.8 percent of DPSS.

II. Hands in the Air
Most students’ interactions with 

police at the University take place 
against the backdrop of parties, with 
the ubiquity of underage drinking 

It was a dismal, Michigan 

morning — cloudy, with raindrops 
that didn’t warrant the use of an 
umbrella but were heavy enough 
for me to put up my sweatshirt 
hood — and it was my first semester 
at the University of Michigan when 
I went to the Bentley Historical 
Library on North Campus for the 
first time. I had been forced into 
familiarity with the buses going to 
the University’s separate campus 
— I had an 8:30 a.m. class on North 
four days a week and knew how 
to navigate the often daunting 
system. I arrived at the library 
after a quick trip on one such bus.

The 
Bentley 
Library 
— 

established 
in 
1935 
by 
the 

University Board of Regents — had 
archives I needed to see for one of 
my earliest stories at the Daily. I was 
working on a piece about the newly 
archived collection of University 
alum Jack Kevorkian, a famed 
advocate for assisted suicide. What 
I found in the archives, procured 
by library assistants, were files of 
what are referred to as “medicide” 
— or medically assisted suicide — 
letters Kevorkian received from 
clients whom were suffering from 
illnesses they believed made their 
lives unbearable. There were also 
records from Kevorkian’s court 
trials; following years of advocacy, 
he was convicted and sent to prison 
for murder.

At the time these papers and 

files were made available to the 
public in December 2015, Lara 

Zielin, the editorial director at the 
Bentley Historical Library, said an 
increase in interest in the archives 
was noticeable.

“It’s a sensitive subject, and 

we’re aware it evokes lots of strong 
feelings,” Zielin said at the time. 
“We’re trying to be respectful and 
cautious about the material while, 
at the same time, not withholding 
the things that his estate wanted 
public.”

These archives are just a 

fraction of 11,000 other research 
collections at the library — from 
those of University administrators 
to 
University 
athletics 
to 

documentation of Detroit’s history 
and state legislature photos — with 
more than 25,000 digital images 
scanned in its image bank, all 
geared toward serving as official 
records of the University and state 
of Michigan.

Of course, the Bentley is one 

of many libraries located at the 

University specifically meant for 
historical collections and that 
allows for visits, updates digital 
archives, hosts temporary exhibits 
and holds events to celebrate the 
materials available. 

Though there is uncertainty 

regarding the future of archive 
preservation 
at 
the 
Bentley, 

the William L. Clements and 
the Gerald R. Ford Presidential 
libraries at the University — 

Concerned 
citizens 
filled 

Larcom City Hall Monday night as 
the Ann Arbor City Council voted 
to authorize the sale of the Library 
Lot, a piece of real estate across 
from the downtown Ann Arbor 
District Library on Fifth Avenue, 
to Chicago developer Core Spaces. 
Core Spaces, a firm centered 
around real estate management, 
is set to built a high-rise at the 
location. 

The 
council’s 
decision 

concluded a decade-long struggle 
for the future of the Library Lot, 
which is currently a city-owned 
surface 
parking 
space. 
Public 

opinion has been dividedbetween 
constructing a $10 million, 17-story, 
multipurpose high-rise — which is 
the current plan — and setting aside 
the land as a public common area 
with a few small-scale residential 
projects.

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski (D–Ward 5) said 
a new building would provide 
several benefits in the long run by 
contributing $5 million in revenue 
from the high rise to the Affordable 
Housing Fund, aiding the current

Inspired 
by 
political 

involvement on campus, LSA 
junior Alexander Forsyth has 
developed a website to help 
expedite the process of sending 
mail to politicians.

The website, called Going 

Postal Politics, aims to reduce the 
tedious process of sending mail 
to three steps: pick from pre-
made postcards, choose which 
politician to send the postcard 
to and send it for 99 cents. Users 
also have the opportunity to 
upload their own photos for 
postcards.

The site asserts that postcards 

are the most effective way to 
deliver a message to politicians 
because of their simplicity and 
visual effect. The postcards 
feature many of the issues 
students 
on 
campus 
have 

been fighting for, such as the 
Black Lives Matter Movement, 
#NoDAPL and the immigration 
ban.

“Most 
of 
the 
inspiration 

comes from students or activist 
Twitter,” Forsyth said. “I’ve been 
paying attention.”

The University of Michigan’s 

Senate Assembly met Monday for 
the last time this academic year to 
hear a report from the Academic 
Performance 
Committee 
and 

discuss various final resolutions.

The meeting began with an 

overview of the APC by LSA Prof. 
Anne Curzan, the chairwoman 
of the APC, and LSA Prof. Ketra 
Armstrong, the faculty athletics 
representative to the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
and Big Ten conference. The 
committee 
handles 
academic-

related policies for intercollegiate 
athletics at the University and 
deals mostly with student-athletes’ 
academic performance.

As of fall 2016, the University 

had 850 student-athletes spread 
out 
over 
29 
athletic 
teams. 

Armstrong 
said 
the 
students 

come 
from 
diverse 
academic 

backgrounds, but seem to be 
performing well across the board.

“Our students are in a number 

of majors,” Armstrong said. “Many 
of them are in LSA, Kinesiology, 
Engineering 
and 
(Sport) 

Management. 
They’re 
taking 

legitimate 
classes, 
and 
we’re 

looking at high-caliber students 
who are participating in high-class 
athletics. We think they’re doing a 
really great job of balancing it all.”

Curzan 
and 
Armstrong 

presented the Assembly with 
graphical evidence that shows 
student-athlete 
academic 

performance has been increasing 
over the last several years. They 
attribute this success to the many 
academic support services that 
have been instated recently, which 
include tutors, mentors and study 
tables — Armstrong said about 62 
percent of student-athletes are 

utilizing these services — but there 
are also other factors at play.

“When you look at the numbers, 

it’s a combination of a lot of things,” 
Armstrong said. “One, I do think 
our coaches have the right mind of 
the balance between athletics and 
education. … We’re also bringing 
in good student-athletes who want 
to have life after sport. And in 
addition to that, it’s understanding 
the support that’s here. That, we 
think, is second to none.”

Armstrong, who has direct 

contact 
with 
the 
student-

athletes, told the Assembly when 
students 
are 
struggling, 
it’s 

usually just because of a lack of 
time management skills. This is 
something Armstrong is working 
to help remedy.

“Most of the situations where 

I have talked to students, it really 
pertained 
not 
to 
something 

systematic, but just making sure 
they have the time management,” 

she said. “And the thing we have 
impressed upon them the most 
is making sure they have a good 
relationship with their faculty.” 

The APC is also trying to 

work on integrating student-
athletes into the greater student 
community. Curzan said this 
means having them use the 
University-wide 
resources 

in addition to more specific 
resources dedicated to student-
athletes.

“We’re really trying to work 

with athletics to make sure 
the student-athletes are taking 
advantage of the resources all 
across campus and make sure 
there are all sorts of bridges built 
to make sure students aren’t 
isolated on South Campus,” 
Curzan said. “We want to 
make sure they’re using their 
own writing centers but also 
Sweetland (Center for Writing).”

The pair then talked to the 

Assembly about graduation rates 
among athletes.

For the 11th consecutive 

year, the University of Michigan 

has broken its record of 

most applications reviewed 

and processed, with 58,590 

applicants seeking admission for 

fall 2017.

This total is a 7-percent 

increase from last year. 

According to University 

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald, 

admission will be offered 

to about 14,000 students, 

making the acceptance rate 

approximately 24 percent.

Last year, about 55,500 

students sent in applications 

for the fall 2016 school year, 

yielding a class of about 

6,600. Of the applicants, 

16,100 students were offered 

admission, resulting in an 

acceptance rate of about 29 

percent.

Although a detailed 

breakdown of the incoming 

class is not yet available, it is 

expected to be similar to that 

of last year, with an acceptance 

rate for in-state students 

of about 40 percent and an 

acceptance rate for out-of-state 

students of about 25 percent.

The number of applicants 

to the University has been 

rising steadily as the number of 

applications this year is nearly 

double that of 2009, when 29,939 

applications were received.

The growing number of 

applications has yielded larger 

class sizes as well, with the 

class of 2020 being the largest 

in University history, despite 

University plans to curb over-

enrollment.

especially with depleting storage 
space, ongoing efforts of digitization 
and a desire to distinguish fact from 
fiction — it seems these libraries 
will continue to be strongholds of 
history for students, faculty and 
historians to come. 

Though non-Bentley staff are 

not allowed in the official storage 
space of the archives, students, 
researchers and alumni can sign 
up online to request materials using 
the online database Mirlyn. Once 
the physical materials are brought 
up from storage, they can only be 
viewed at the library. Photographs 
can 
be 
taken 
of 
authorized 

materials, and placeholder cards are 
given when there are multiple files 
in order in an archive box.

My English 221 course, Literature 

and Writing Outside the Classroom, 
taught by Lecturer James Pinto, 
traveled to the Bentley this semester 

in search of old letters for analysis. 
The class — centered around the art 
and significance of letter writing — 
was able to look at former students’ 
letters, letters from the civil war 
and scrapbooks of letters from a 
woman — Lulu B. Middleton — 
affectionately named Aunt Lulu.

Bentley director since 2013, 

Terrence McDonald said the most 
significant and unique collections in 
the library include a collection of the 
work of architect Albert Kahn, who 
designed and constructed many 
prominent buildings — including 
the Detroit News and Detroit Free 
Press buildings, numerous Ford 
Motor Co. plants nationwide, the 
University’s Angell Hall, Ruthan 
Natural History Museum and the 
Clements library itself — books 
written by University faculty and 
staff and notebooks from students 
who took courses taught by famed 
philosopher John Dewey. These 
collections attract historians and 
students from about 60 courses 
per year, in programs across the 

University.

The Bentley takes in materials 

that hold value for researchers and 
students on information relating to 
the University and state. Recently, 
the archives have added materials 
related to Detroit’s underground 
magazines, and also showcase 
a 
number 
of 
student-made 

scrapbooks from the late-19th and 
early-20th centuries.

However, because of a recent 

shift toward online research and 
the University’s bicentennial, the 
Bentley has taken a number of steps 
for digitization and has contributed 
many materials to the celebrations, 
thought not all with ease.

“The digitization is challenging 

in that it requires all of the expenses 
of curation and storage of a paper 
collection, and then adding onto 
that the cost of digitization,” 
McDonald said.

Forsythe, a computer science 

major, said he originally created 
the 
program 
to 
assist 
his 

girlfriend, who had to handwrite 
postcards for her job. Later, his 

market became apparent when 
watching students labor over 
sending mail to representatives in 
bulk. He then set on automating 
the process in “five clicks.”

“I 
was 
in 
the 
(Shapiro 

Undergraduate 
Library) 
in 

January, right after the election, 
and there were 50 some women 

sitting in the back of the UGLi who 
had literally printed out a big stack 
of postcards and were writing 
addresses of representatives on 
the back,” he said.

and drug use. Still, Black students 
assert that their functions are 
hyper-patrolled, to the extent that 
every predominantly Black party 
gets shut down by police officers. 

AAPD Sgt. Thomas Hickey 

leads 
the 
department’s 

Community Engagement unit, and 
emphasized “party patrol” officers 
are indiscriminate in policing off-
campus parties, as officers only 
respond to phone calls. Public 
Policy junior Stephen Wallace took 
issue, however, with the frequency 
of 
the 
alleged 
complaints, 

especially as many students live 
around other students.

“You ask them, ‘Why is our 

party being shut down,’ or ‘What 
can we have done differently,’ 
and it’s just like ‘Oh, people are 
calling,’ ” Wallace said. “I just don’t 
believe it’s all coincidence, I refuse 
to believe every time we throw 
a party someone just happens to 
call.”

Many students point to the 

vicious cycle of the imbalance: 
Black student groups simply do not 
leverage the institutional resources 
on 
campus 
to 
accommodate 

and control activities like those 
of older, predominantly white 
fraternities and sororities. Nearly 
every chapter affiliated with the 
Interfraternity Council or the 
Panhellenic Association has a long-
standing address registered with 
their respective council — none 
of the “Divine Nine” historically 
Black chapters of the National 
Pan-Hellenic Council, on the other 
hand, have a long-term address on 
campus. Black parties hosted at off-
campus locations, then, are rarely 
registered with the University’s 
Office of Greek Life.

“We cram the whole Black 

community into a three-room 
apartment,” Toxey quipped.

“Minorities don’t have enough 

stuff for people on campus,” 
agreed LSA senior Javon Shell. 
“It’s rare for a frat like us, or let’s 
say like Alpha or Que, would be in 
the same house two years in a row. 
We pretty much go house to house, 
and call that house our house. We 
don’t have big houses, we don’t 
have these luxuries. But yet, every 
time we try to have fun it gets shut 
down. Literally every time.”

Shell, leader of historically 

Black fraternity Kappa Alpha Psi, 
recalled an incident of aggression 
with officers at the frat’s annual 
Christmas in July party last 
summer. Shell said KAP threw 
the party in a white fraternity 
house on Hill and State Streets 
to account for the large crowd. 
After admitting over 1,000 people 
arrived at the venue, he said 
police used unnecessary force and 
roughness when shutting the party 
down.

“Christmas in July was very 

aggressive,” Shell said. “You could 
tell they didn’t know how to handle 
that many people — Black people 
specifically — and the way they 
handled it was so bad.”

Police from seven different 

districts, he added, were called 
to shut down the party. Though 
University Police spokeswoman 
Diane Brown told The Michigan 
Daily in a December interview 
that 
police 
from 
multiple 

jurisdictions are usually brought 
in on game days to account for the 
large amount of partying, she did 
not say the same happens during 
regular weekends or over the 
summer.

According to a police report 

detailing 
the 
party 
attained 

through a Freedom of Information 
Act request, the officers on the 
scene included the entire AAPD 
night shift, all available units 
from DPSS, at least four Michigan 
State 
Police 
troopers, 
one 

Chelsea sergeant and a Pittsfield 
Township officer. The Washtenaw 
County Sheriff’s department also 
redirected 
Dexter 
Township 

squad cars to assist, but canceled 
the order before their arrival. The 
report states over 500 people were 
in attendance and over 200 people 
were on the road near Hill Street.

Though Shell said no major 

altercations 
occurred, 
AAPD 

Officer James Boylan provided 
a written statement that he 
observed a large fight breaking 
out, then overheard radio traffic 
that there had been gunshots 
fired — though police later found 
no evidence of guns at the party. 
Nonetheless, Boylan deployed his 
department to issue pepper spray 
in areas where crowds were not 
dispersing. Boylan wrote he was 
“unsure how many people were 
hit with the mace.”

Shell highlighted Christmas in 

July as one prominent example of 
AAPD unnecessarily monitoring 
Black parties. KAP functions are 
usually shut down by 1 a.m. or 2 
a.m., he said, and police officers 
enter date parties to check 
identification and cups, and he 
once finished cleaning up a party 
at the University Sports Coliseum 
only to find two squad cars still 
idling in the parking lot.

“Not every event is going 

to break into a fight,” he said. 
“We don’t have that established 
foundation that these other people 
do have. And we can’t (often) get 
venues like (the Sports Coliseum) 
because we’re Black.”

LSA sophomore Gracie Dunn, 

a member of the majority-white 
Zeta Tau Alpha, wrote in an 
email interview the Panhellenic 
Association party registration 
system ensures her contact with 
the police — outside high-profile 
daytime parties or tailgates — 
remains limited.

“In the year and a half I’ve been 

here, I haven’t been to one mixer 
that’s gotten shut down,” she 
wrote.

The Office of Greek Life 

declined to comment on this story.

The police scrutiny isn’t limited 

to the time and place the of event 
itself: Black students say they’re 
more likely to be stopped before, 
after and even completely outside 
the context of partying at all.

Wallace remembered a night 

of his Welcome Week in 2014, he 
was returning to his dorm on the 
Hill from a friend’s house when 
suddenly, a bright light stopped 
him in his tracks. A DPSS officer 
demanded Wallace put his arms 
up and proceeded to violently 
frisk him, even tugging on his 
insulin monitor. The officer finally 
stopped, and when Wallace asked 
if he needed to show ID, the cop 
refused.

“He said ‘you fit the description 

for a gun crime in the area, but 
there was no place on your body to 
conceal a weapon,’ ” Wallace said. 
“It was over the top.”

As with Toxey, DPSS dropped 

the issue. 

“There was no police report 

filed,” he said. “I called for the 
next couple of days … but there 
was no follow up; nothing really 
came of it. Almost like saying, ‘you 
can go here, but never said you can 
enjoy being here’ — that’s the way 
it feels sometimes.”

III. Good Cop, Bad Cop
With 
these 
collective 

experiences 
and 
memories, 

it’s not a stretch to understand 
why, as countless hashtags and 
protests have exposed by 2017, 
Black communities are reluctant 
to place their trust in law 
enforcement agencies. As Black 
LSA junior Priscilla Huddleston 
pointed out, students coming 
from 
predominantly 
Black 

communities arrive with very 
different outlooks on relationships 
with police forces. 

“I have a trust for police officers 

in Detroit that I don’t have here,” 
she said of her hometown’s police 
force, which was 62 percent Black 
as of 2013. “You can’t protect who 
you fear. You fear what you don’t 
know.”

University Police Chief Robert 

Neumann 
doesn’t 
shy 
from 

criticism about his force, and 
admits he hasn’t been in close 
contact with Black students on 
campus. Both AAPD and DPSS 
participated 
in 
two 
annual 

Pancakes & Policing dialogues put 
on by the Black Student Union and 
Students of Color of Rackham. 
DPSS drew on the feedback 
in part to craft its sub-plan on 
diversity, equity and inclusion; 
initiatives currently being piloted 
include 
division-wide 
implicit 

bias 
training, 
microagression 

workshops and a plan to recruit 
more diverse officers. 

“I never had a sense (race 

relations) were bad,” Neumann 
said. “I can’t tell you about a 
time where we’ve had a bad 
relationships … but like to think 
it’s 
improving. 
Better 
than 

average. If those questions are 
unresolved, I’d like to know more 
about that.”

Hickey, 
however, 
pushed 

students to consider their own 
stereotypes about police officers, 
especially for those “transitory 
citizens” coming from other 
communities. He admitted the 
pancake breakfast was the first 
significant 
dialogue 
between 

Black students and AAPD, but 
claimed the department has 
been practicing diversity and 
de-escalation training “for years.” 

Racial profiling, he insisted, is 

not an issue in Ann Arbor.

“What did you do that brought 

unfair treatment on?” he said he’d 
ask students. “Because an officer 

would lose their job over racial 
profiling. That hasn’t happened 
here. If you’re saying that because 
it happened in another city … it’s 
not going to happen here.”

Hickey pressed further, at 

times questioning the credibility 
of students’ accounts.

“When you have a student 

that’s underage and intoxicated, a 
large majority of them are mean 
or aggressive, but sober, they’re 
the nicest person and apologetic,” 
he said. “If you’re throwing 
alcohol into the mix, you’re not 
making good choices. If police did 
100 percent of what you wanted 
them to do, would the problem go 
away?”

He agreed, though, community 

relations between AAPD and 
students in general could stand to 
be improved. Efforts to establish 
a civilian review board have 
stalled, as a $200,000 audit of the 
department is still underway.

“If students don’t reach out, we 

can’t get this clarified,” Hickey 
said. “I’ve been aware of race 
relations my whole life. How do 
you think this makes me feel? 
We continue to battle negative 
perceptions. We have to step up 
our game in areas other police 
officers don’t even touch.”

James, 
who 
was 
stopped 

years ago by an AAPD officer 
who couldn’t believe she worked 
at the University, suggested the 
dialogue for city officers move 
beyond annual breakfasts.

“I see AAPD trying — but 

I don’t think just one or two 
officers can,” she said. “When 
you have this many people saying 
the same things, it’s a systemic 
problem.”

IV. Between Two Worlds
Add in the racist flyers, the 

threatening 
emails 
and 
the 

ever-dwindling Black student 
body population, and a fractious 
campus becomes even more 
divided 
by 
disproportionate 

policing. 
Whether 
students 

experience 
police 
aggression 

firsthand or secondhand, the 
result for many is arguably the 
same. An already alienated Black 
community 
sequesters 
itself 

even further from seemingly 
unwelcoming spaces.

Black 
students 
even 
stop 

themselves from seeking the 
outlets most students would 
otherwise avail themselves of. 
According to a self-survey by the 
Black Student Union, 34 percent 
of students feel uncomfortable 
approaching officers in uniform. 

“I shouldn’t have this distrust 

or this disdain in my heart every 
time I see someone in a uniform, 
but due to what’s going on, due 
to how they police our events 
and police us on this campus, I 
don’t have much of a choice in the 
matter in how I see the police,” 
Wallace said.

Huddleston, 
one 
of 
the 

only Black members of the 
cheerleading team, said she’s 
turned heads at predominantly 
white parties she’s attended for 
being “too loud.” Shell looks back 
on his Black friends who pledged 
IFC frats, and laments their 
separation from the larger Black 
community.

James, however, related the 

more jarring story as proof of the 
toll on Black students’ mental 
health. As she entered a Haven 
Hall elevator two weeks ago with 
three of her Black students in 
DAAS — an academic space — the 
two white people already in the 
elevator appeared unsettled. No 
more than a minute later, they all 
exited, one remarking to James, 
“we’ll take the stairs.”

“I want to believe this place is 

for me, but … it does get to prey 
upon you,” James said. “So why 
not stay safe? I feel safer around 
other people of color.”

Many 
of 
the 
University’s 

DEI efforts hinge on successful 
collaboration between students 
of all races and ethnicities. With 
a strategic plan that largely fails 
to engage with the implications 
of disparate law enforcement 
begs the question: If Black 
students don’t feel comfortable 
around white students because 
predominantly white institutions 
are not yet attuned to Black 
needs, who can break the cycle? 
How much of the burden should, 
or can, be placed on the students 
themselves?

Toxey is slower to smile in 

public these days, and entire 
cohorts of Black students subject 
to overpolicing aren’t far behind 
him.

Hickey—with 
the 
full 

force of AAPD’s three-person 
Community 
Engagement 

department behind him—wound 
up asking the question at the 
heart of the matter.

housing shortage in Ann Arbor.

“If I vote no on this, would 

I be willing to sit on the phone 
Tuesday and call people on the 
Housing Commission, on the 
waitlist and say, ‘we’re down on 
money on affordable housing 
and I couldn’t help you guys’?” 
Warpehoski said. “I couldn’t 
imagine doing that.”

However, 
public 
polling 

has shown majority support 
for a public space. A 2013 Park 
Advisory 
Commission 
survey 

showed that 76.2 percent of 
respondents 
thought 
Ann 

Arbor would benefit from more 
downtown open spaces, like a 
park or town square, and 41.5 
percent of respondents chose the 
Library Lot as the best place to 
build such a space.

Last year, the Ann Arbor 

Committee for the Community 
Commons delivered a petition 
to put the future of the lot to the 
November election ballot, but it 
fell just short of a few hundred 
signatures because of technical 
mistakes.

The 
crowd 
became 
increasingly 

restless as councilmembers urged 
compromise and attempted to 

quell concerns about floor-area 
ratio, as an Internal Revenue 
Service 
audit 
of 
the 
Build 

America Bonds was issued to 
create the parking space under 
the Library Lot, and other salient 
details. 

The tension reached a tipping 

point 
when 
Councilmember 

Julie 
Grand 
(D–Ward 
3) 

charged 
that 
anti-high 
rise 

advocates were ignoring the 
realities 
of 
compromise 
and 

resisting stubbornly against a 
democratically decided process.

e’re graduating into 
a world that is more 
fractious than ever 

before. This statement, 
which 
has 
been 

repeated for years, has 
moved 
from 
insight 

to truism to enduring 
political reality. We can 
put our heads in the 
sand, drown out the 
rest of the world with 
Colbert clips and retreat 
into our enclaves. Or we 
can do something about 
it. Personally, the last 
six years of the Obama 
administration lulled me into a 
sense of complacency. We lived 
under a divided government with 
incremental social victories on the 
national level by the left, like the 
expansion of LGBTQ rights, and 
by the right on the local level, like 
restrictions on abortion access.

I often recall the quote by Martin 

Luther King Jr.: “ the arc of the moral 
universe is long but it bends toward 
justice.” There’s inevitability to it. 
But after watching the liberal (small 
“l” Lockean liberal, not big “L” 
Democrat liberal) world order tear 
at the seams, I’ve begun to realize 
that our future is not inevitable. 
We must actively work to craft the 
world in which we want to live.

This might sound obvious. I’m 

sure that the Facebook commenters 
will tear me a new one for sharing 
such an obvious failing. But I would 
seriously ask that everyone try 
to find a way they can make the 
world a better place. Even if you’re 
working outside policy as a 9 to 5 
(more realistically 9 to 9) business 
consultant, find time to volunteer at 
a food bank or tutor children on the 
weekends. It’s too easy to become 
complacent. Seriously reflecting 
and finding the time to help make 
the world a better place is part of our 
duty to the American people.

Right now, the United States 

is going through a period of deep 
unrest, but I think we have an 
opportunity. 
Politics 
is 
often 

defined as the art of the possible. 
But what is possible seems to 
have shrunk. Gone are the New 
Deals, the Great Societies, even 
the Contracts with America. I 
don’t mean to sound like a Sanders 
acolyte — I’m not 
 — but I really do 

believe this is the time we need to 
relitigate American truths. Why 
can’t the United States have a 
welfare state like the Netherlands? 
Why can’t we have a universal 
basic income, a policy that Nixon 
privately supported?

Ross Douthat, The New York 

Times’ token Republican, has spent 
the past couple months writing 
about policies that he believes 
would be good for society but 
politically impossible. I implore 
each of my readers to think about 

why their ideal world is “politically 
impossible.” Social security seemed 
impossible 100 years ago, and now 

it’s a cornerstone of 
our political reality. 
With dedication, we 
can expand the scope 
of the possible.

Beyond legislative 

goals, we need to 
reflect on how to create 
a truly inclusive civic 
society. The sexual 
revolution 
liberated 

millions of women. 
But now evangelical 
Christians are feeling 

increasingly endangered by a more 
sexual public sphere. Perhaps part 
of this may be due to misogyny, but 
part of it comes from a very real place 
of having their values threatened. 
How do we create a country that 
caters to both groups? I don’t have 
the answer, but I think there’s room 
in the middle for both groups to find 
common ground. Both a number of 
feminist and religious conservatives 
have criticized the prevalence of 
pornography in our society, perhaps 
for different reasons, but there’s 
room for collaboration that could 
help build a more inclusive society.

But there are basic values we 

can’t compromise; they are too 
essential for our democracy. We 
must maintain a respect for open 
participation. 
Our 
democracy 

is better when more people 
vote. However, this is at risk. 
Voting identification laws have 
consistently stifled the voices 
of 
the 
most 
marginalized 

among 
us. 
Furthermore, 

gerrymandering 
has 
been 

used 
by 
Republicans 
and 

Democrats to make elections 
more 
difficult 
to 
contest. 

Both tactics may be politically 
expedient but they whittle our 
democracy’s foundation.

We 
also 
must 
have 

compassion for the oppressed. 
Listen with an open heart and 
an open mind when a person 
in pain tells you about their 
struggles. 
This 
extends 
to 

people we wouldn’t traditionally 
view 
as 
marginalized. 
It’s 

truly a privilege to attend the 
University of Michigan, and 
the critical thinking skills that 
we’ve honed have been a blessing. 
With this degree, we’re part of 
the intellectual elites. With that 
honor comes an obligation. Many 
don’t have the luxury to learn 
in the environment we have. 
We need to learn how to talk to 
those people. That means having 
uncomfortable 
conversations 

with the archetypical racist 
uncle or your teenage brother 
when he makes offhand sexist 
comments. That means standing 
up for others even when it’s 
difficult for you.

Throughout Barack Obama’s 

presidency, 
I 
was 
relatively 

uncritical of his mass surveillance 
policies because I trusted him. Now 
that President Donald Trump has 
control over the National Security 
Agency, I’ve become increasingly 
concerned about what effects 
mass data collection will have on 
undocumented immigrants and 
Muslims. In 1967, Noam Chomsky 
warned about the danger of left-
wing intellectuals being co-opted 
by the Johnson administration’s 
imperialist 
policies. 
We 
have 

to remain critical of our own 
government, even when candidates 
we support hold the reins of power.

Lastly, there are dark fringes that 

have moved increasingly center-
stage this past year. These are not 
people with whom we negotiate. 
We can’t debase ourselves by 
acting as though the ideologies 
that undergird the alt-right are as 
legitimate as any other. This is not 
a missive against the Republican 
Party. Since I’ve come to attend 
the Ford School of Public Policy, 
I’ve come to respect a number 
of 
staunch 
Republicans 
and 

understand that we have common 
goals. For example, a number of 
mainstream conservatives, such as 
Marco Rubio and Newt Gingrich, 
have recognized the reality of 
racist policing. Let’s keep our eyes 
and ears open for unexpected allies 
outside of our own camp and build 
new coalitions to achieve our goals.

However, we must remain 

vigilant. While some populist 
Democrats share Chief Strategist 
Steve Bannon’s desire for a massive 
infrastructure bill, working with 
him further cements Bannon’s 
power and political legitimacy. But 
we need to distinguish between the 
Steve Bannons and the Ben Sasses 
of the world., between people who 
are willing to stand up against the 
bigotry in their own ranks and 
those who will abuse our political 
system for their nefarious ends.

With an enduring commitment 

to our most important values and 
constant questioning of the world 
around us, we can really make the 
world a better place. That’s really 
the crux of public policy. When 
you strip away all the trappings, 
that’s why we all chose to study 
our discipline. Borrowing from 
Herman Cain, borrowing from 
Pokemon, I would like to leave 
everyone with these words of 
wisdom: “Life can be a challenge. 
Life can seem impossible. It’s 
never easy when there’s so much 
on the line. But you and I can 
make a difference. There’s a 
mission just for you and me … Just 
look inside and you will find just 
what you can do.”

I

f you told me a year 
ago that in a year I’d 
be writing about how 

I love chemistry, I probably 
would have laughed in your 
face. Around that time, I was 
miserably glued to Problem 
Roulette, an online tool filled 
with thousands of multiple-
choice questions from past 
exams in Chemistry 130, the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

primary introductory general 
chemistry course. I had done 
well enough on the course’s 
midterm exams by reviewing 
past homework and doing 
plenty of textbook problems. 
But the finale of my studying 
always required a trip to the 
deep pits of Problem Roulette, 
a tool that would test my 
understanding of the material 
while also giving me a flavor 
of what I would find in 30 
multiple-choice 
questions 

come exam day. 

A 
year 
later, 
I’m 
not 

approaching 
my 
second-

semester organic chemistry 
final with the same dread 
I felt a year ago. A lot has 
changed 
since 
then: 
I’ve 

fully settled into the rhythm 
of 
college 
studying, 
I’ve 

had a number of inspiring 
chemistry 
professors 
and 

graduate student instructors 
and I’ve developed a good 
support system among my 
peers. But what has most 
changed in my mind is how 
I’ve been asked to approach 
exams in organic chemistry.

Instead 
of 
bubbling 
in 

letters on a Scantron, organic 
chemistry 
exams 
feature 

questions 
that 
require 

students to draw structures 
and mechanistic arrows to 
model 
how 
the 
concepts 

and 
reactions 
occur 
and 

work together. As such, my 
studying has focused less on 
integrating multiple aspects 
of a problem into an A, B, C, D 
or E answer and has focused 
more on making sure I can 
explain and draw out concepts 
in a coursepack of old exams. 
The difference in my attitude 
toward the two classes could 
not be starker: Instead of 
worrying whether all my work 
on a multiple-choice problem 
boils down to a single correct 
or 
incorrect 
answer, 
I’m 

studying by drawing reactions 
to diagnose exactly what I 
know and don’t know.

Multiple-choice 
exams 

have always received wrath 
from the likes of standardized 
test opponents and those who 
claim that requiring students 
to bubble in responses on 
a 
separate 
Scantron 
form 

makes it too easy to make 
a mistake. I’m not so sure I 
oppose them outright, but I 
do take issue with how they’re 
used in introductory science, 
technology, 
engineering 

and 
mathematics 
courses 

such as general chemistry. 
Introductory 
courses 
exist 

to teach important concepts 
to a wide audience, but they 
also 
should 
inspire 
and 

excite 
students 
about 
the 

possibilities in a field. Using 
multiple-choice exams as a 
primary method of assessment 
takes this seemingly primary 
goal of inspiring and exciting 
students about STEM and 
makes it secondary.

Take this example of how 

a 
core 
concept 
could 
be 

assessed 
through 
multiple 

methods: 
Intramolecular 

interactions 
underpin 

everyday life, from the boiling 
point of liquids to ensuring 
your stomach enzymes have 
the correct shape to digest 
specific proteins into their 
subcomponent 
amino-acids. 

A 
multiple-choice 
question 

in general chemistry might 
assess this concept by listing 
a number of molecules and 
asking which one does not have 
an 
intramolecular 
interaction 

affecting boiling point, while 
a non-multiple-choice problem 
might ask a student to draw 
the specific interactions that 
stabilize a molecule.

Both 
questions 
assess 

practically the same thing. 
But the feedback the second 
question provides makes it 
more 
valuable. 
A 
student 

who gets the multiple-choice 
question wrong just knows 
that they lack some piece 
of 
understanding 
about 

intramolecular 
interactions. 

In contrast, a non-multiple-
choice 
question 
shows 

students 
immediately 
what 

they understood and missed 
and can award a range of credit 
depending on the completeness 
of the answer. Needless to say, 
the ability to guess correctly 
without understanding seldom 
exists on non-multiple-choice 
questions.

Multiple-choice 
exams 

simply tell students whether 
they answered correctly or 
incorrectly, regardless of if 
they understood 0 percent or 
90 percent of the problem. 
While 
the 
differences 
in 

feedback may be addressed 
with the help of an instructor, 
students who are not always 
inclined to immediately seek 
out help from an instructor 
will feel demoralized if they 
thought they understood most 
of the concept and lost points 
on the full question because 
of a small error. I feel grateful 
that I came to college having 
had terrific mentors in high 
school who encouraged me 
to pursue a path in STEM. 
But I worry that when just 
a few dozen multiple-choice 
problems determine most of 
a grade, those who are just 
testing the waters of STEM 
can 
become 
demoralized 

by how the exam format of 
courses like Chemistry 130 
treat their progress, and may 
leave the field all together, 
as STEM fields have high 
attrition rates.

Some 
may 
deride 
this 

call 
for 
assessments 
that 

recognize 
the 
multiple 

aspects of an answer as a call 
for “participation trophies” 
for answers that aren’t 100 
percent 
correct. 
Multiple-

choice tests are a terrifically 
simple and low-effort way 
to separate an “A” student 
from a “B” student from 
a “C” student. But should 
that be the only goal of an 
assessment in an introductory 
class? Introductory classes, 
especially 
in 
STEM, 
are 

supposed to teach and assess, 
but also should paint students 
a picture of the road ahead if 
they pursue a STEM path.

While using non-multiple-

choice 
exams 
in 
large 

introductory classes requires 
an increase in grading effort 
and costs, in my mind, the 
benefits make them worth it. 
While by no means a panacea 
to all of STEM education’s 
difficulties, 
non-multiple-

choice exams provide students 
with honest feedback about 
their performance instead of 
just a simple score.

N

obody’s 
perfect. 

It’s 
an 
age-old 

mantra that lets us 

find a bit of comfort in our 
shortcomings. Our mothers, 
friends, teachers and coaches 
have hammered this basic 
pillar of humanity into our 
brains. Imperfections, we are 
taught, are universal and part 
of what make us human.

It is a shame, then, that we 

have begun to view perfection 
more as a choice and less 
as 
a 
pipe 
dream. 
Human 

error, polluted by agendas, 
politicking and biases, has 
slowly warped into a tool 
that 
perpetuates 
division. 

What’s 
more 
disheartening 

is that, more often than not, 
the 
imperfections 
that 
we 

see in others or in ourselves 
are irrelevant in context. We 
are quick to judge but slow to 
empathize. With this line of 
thinking, shortcomings are not 
seen as human error — they 
are seen as inexcusable. Worse 
is that they are used as false 
equivalencies in the hope of 
invalidating things that come 
to our attention.

Take 
the 
latest 
public 

relations faux pas, courtesy 
of United Airlines. In the age 
of social media, it did not take 
long for videos to surface of Dr. 
David Dao being dragged down 
the aisle of a plane by United 
Airline’s security and the bloody 
aftermath. Nor did it take long 
for United Airline’s stock prices 
to tumble or for the boycott 
sirens to ring after United 
Airline’s President Oscar Munoz 
doubled down on the company’s 
self-vindication. But even as 
most of the world criticized 
United Airline’s handling of 
the whole fiasco, a different 

narrative began to emerge in 
other enclaves of the media.

Dao, the headlines read, 

had his own personal demons. 
Information swirled that Dao 
had his medical license revoked 
in 2005 after being convicted 
of 
drug-related 
offenses. 

With this new information, 
the story shifted away from 
the growing injustices levied 
by corporations like United 
Airline’s to the culpability of 
the victim – never mind the 
irrelevance of a nonviolent drug 
offense 12 years ago to being 
manhandled out of a purchased 
seat. The fallacy of the defense 
that “he was no angel” is that 
it overplays any prior mishaps 
of the victim. It provides 
unnecessary 
context 
to 
a 

situation as a false equivalence 
to 
sidestep 
the 
underlying 

problem. Through the wealth 
of information available at our 
fingertips, we have jumped the 
gun in trying to play both sides.

This 
way 
of 
approaching 

controversial situations has come 
to be known as “whataboutism.” 
Whataboutism 
is 
the 
name 

given 
by 
The 
Economist’s 

Edward Lucas to describe a 
propaganda technique birthed 
by the Soviet Union to deflect 
criticisms from the Western 
world by asking “What about … 
?” followed by an event in the 
Western world. Whataboutism 
is dangerous because it makes 
us so hyper-focused on human 
error 
or 
imperfection, 
even 

when 
inapplicable 
to 
the 

overall context, that we neglect 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
initial 

wrongdoing. In Dao’s case, his 
own mishaps over a decade 
ago created the false sense that 
there was more to the story than 
United Airline’s wrongdoing.

But whataboutism has not 

just popped up in isolated 
circumstances. Its resurgence 
in the United States has been 
steady and widespread not just 
in social situations, but also in 
politics. President Donald Trump 
has used whataboutism to avoid 
implicating 
Russian 
Prime 

Minister Vladimir Putin for the 
crimes he has committed against 
people who oppose him. Trump’s 
response 
to 
MSNBC’s 
Joe 

Scarborough’s point that Putin 
“kills journalists that don’t agree 
with him,” was, “Well, I think 
that our country does plenty 
of killing also.” In a February 
interview with Fox News’ Bill 
O’Reilly, in which O’Reilly said, 
“Putin’s a killer,” Trump replied, 
“There are a lot of killers. We’ve 
got a lot of killers. What, do you 
think our country’s so innocent?”

Trump’s 
whataboutism 

implies 
that 
Russia’s 

transgressions are less evil 
because the U.S has its own 
faults. But when Trump uses 
the faults of the U.S as reasons 
to not denounce the mishaps 
of other countries, there is no 
accountability to prevent future 
catastrophes on the global stage. 
This reasoning makes us prone 
to disaster.

The fallacious whataboutism 

that is used to justify matters like 
Dao’s forceful removal from his 
flight and Trump’s foreign policy 
toward Russia is a dangerous race 
to the bottom. When we use one’s 
past to question the legitimacy of 
their victimization, we ignore the 
real issue at hand. Justice should 
not be limited to people who have 
clean records.

Whataboutism distracts from justice

Kendrick Lamar’s “DAMN.” came out last Friday
Cyclical black conscious is 
embodied on LP ‘DAMN.’

Although 
scholars 
contest 

the dates, Pablo Picasso’s Blue 
Period is set between 1901 and 
1904. Reeling from a close friend’s 
suicide, Picasso descended into a 
deep depression, blue tones soon 
coming to dominate his canvases. 
As bright hues darkened, so too 
did subject matter, his artwork 
devolving into bleak narratives of 
prostitutes, beggars and drunks. 
Struggling through poverty as 
consequence, this period marks 
his first shift away from classicism 
into what ultimately solidified into 
Cubism.

DAMN. 
opens 
with 
an 

arrangement of mellow strings 
reminiscent of Hans Zimmer. 
Kendrick’s tone is gentle, reserved, 
tranquil. Reminiscing, he recalls 
a woman – a blind woman – 
who is frustrated because she’s 
dropped 
something 
precious. 

Lady Justice has misplaced her 
balance scales. In prototypical 
hyperconscious fashion, Lamar 
alludes to the eroding integrity of 
American political life. Watching 
Lady Liberty struggle, Kendrick 
approaches, kindly offering to 
help. He points out that she’s lost 
something. She responds, “Oh, yes. 
You have lost something. You’ve 
lost… your life.”

Lamar is shot. Is it wickedness?
Spiraling out of a Fox News 

segment, 
the 
album 
abruptly 

transitions into the most colossal 
braggadocio banger of Lamar’s 
career: “I got, I got, I got, I got / 
Loyalty, I got royalty, inside my 
DNA / Cocaine quarter piece, got 
war and peace, inside my DNA 
/ I got power, poison, pain and 
joy, inside my DNA / I got hustle 
though, ambition, flow, inside my 
DNA.” In trademark Mike WiLL 
Made-It fashion, a dark, groaning 
baseline oozes against a guitar 
modulated down into the twang 
of a holy sitar. Towards the back 
half of “DNA.,” a vocal proclaiming 
“gimme some ganja” is abrasively 
mixed into the track. Alongside 
Kendrick’s ruthless rhythm, the 
song 
masterfully 
reflects 
our 

modern, oversaturated, GIMME-
GIMME-GIMME-GIMME-
GIMME-GIMME-post-internet 
multiracial consciousness.

From Section.80 through to 

last year’s untitled unmastered., 
Kendrick has been continually 
fusing West Coast gangsta with 
jazz, funk, soul and spoken word, 
bridging the avant-garde with 
the accessible. It’s easy to forget 
that the man who did “Backseat 
Freestyle” is the same one who did 
“i.”

What marks DAMN. as an 

inflection 
point 
in 
Kendrick 

Lamar’s evolution is its stripped-
down, 
Spartan 
sound; 
it’s 

surprising that Rick Rubin doesn’t 
have 
any 
production 
credits. 

Although there is a curious 
departure into dance & electronic 
in “LOYALTY.,” “LOVE.” and 
through the synths of “GOD.,” the 
album is largely centered around 
inflected soul and hard-hitting, 
classical hip hop. It’s telling 
that 
jazz-influenced, 
frequent 

collaborator Thundercat is only 
credited on a single bassline.

Lamar’s interests have pivoted, 

his focus tightened. In Jobsian 
fashion, the album’s minimal 
is its most mosaic. Between 
the layers of sonic complexity, 
BADBADNOTGOOD-assisted 
“LUST.” 
is 
a 
standout. 
The 

track opens with a waterlogged 
psychedelic riff: a tune reminiscent 
of 
Hendrix’s 
nasal 
solos 
on 

Electric 
Ladyland. 
A 
cyclical 

filter sweep is tucked between 
guitar and the vocals, its closest 
cousin the spellbinding whoosh 
of Radiohead’s “Like Spinning 

Plates.” Make no mistake, this 
is a rap track: one with bars 
grafted 
between 
Atlanta-trap-

deriven-triplicate-Hi-Hats. 
While Kendrick has long been 
one to explore unconventional 
percussion (See: “Momma”), here 
we see the furthest he’s ever delved 
into the experimental left-field. 
For the first half of the track, kicks 
and snares are noticeably absent. 
When they do appear, they show 
up for one, two, three beats and 
then disappear for another four, 
five, seven. The sound resembles 
footwork’s surgical DNA splicing 
much more than traditional snare-
driven hip hop. At very few points 
of the track are all elements in play, 
either: it’s usually just one or two 
sounds. “LUST.” does not feature 
Kendrick’s 
most 
complicated 

drumkit 
nor 
his 

most 
dynamic 

vocals. Rather, the 
song’s intrigue is in 
its sheer precision, 
the 
calculated 

technicality through 
which 
its 
sounds 

morph.

“DUCKWORTH.” 
is 
some 

of Kendrick’s most soul-heavy 
work to date. Layered samples 
compete for with his rhymes 
for space, similar to his verse on 
“No More Parties in LA,” track 
17 of Kanye’s most recent effort, 
The Life of Pablo. Yet, the album’s 
slowed-down, soulful minimalism 
isn’t without its contrast. In fact, 
DAMN. is further proof that no 
rapper alive has the aesthetic 
versatility of Lamar. On “XXX.,” 
Lamar ventures into the industrial, 
rapping over police sirens mixed 
down to sound exactly like they 
were lifted from “Need for Speed: 
Most Wanted.” On “FEAR.,” the 
bridge is looped backwards, and 
it sounds as if he’s been divinely 
possessed by the Holy Spirit, 
prophesying in ancient tongue.

Rising from the bleak depths 

of depression, Picasso’s entered 
a new era near the end of 1904: 
The Rose Period. Although most 
of 
posthumous-Picasso-interest 

is centered on the Blue Period, 
it was only in the Rose period 
that the technical foundations of 
Picasso’s later abstraction would 
begin to crystallize. Themes of 
solitude and despair evolved into 
pink and orange compositions that 
articulated cheer and question.

Kendrick Lamar is an artist 

first and rapper second. Although 
his product is packaged as ‘music,’ 
his medium is language, and his 
work strives to extend beyond 
the bounds of lyrical form. His 
rap stretches into poetry and 
spoken word, and his albums are 
cinematic. The cover of good kid, 
m.A.A.d city has the words “A 
Short Film by Kendrick Lamar’” 
scribbled onto it. Beyond his bridge 
between word and film, Kendrick 
utilizes artwork to exhibit content 
and give flesh to aesthetic. Greens, 
blues, browns, greys and blacks 
dominate all his past covers. While 
the straight grey of 2015’s To 
Pimp a Butterfly reflects its blunt, 
detached, sociopolitical truth, the 
fusion of color in his other work 
reflects an earthly calmness: a 
calmness under which deep, nested 
tensions brew.

DAMN. is red — devilishly 

so. Donning a plain-white tee, 
Kendrick stares at the camera, 
eyeballs lowered, his expression 
one of possession, one in need of 
exorcism. “In my DNA / In my 
DNA / In my DNA.” Rhythmic 
repetition stretches across the 
LP. “Ain’t nobody praying for me 
/ Ain’t nobody praying for me / 
Ain’t nobody praying for me.” 
The litany is cathartic, dogmatic, 
Gregorian. “I’ll probably die / I’ll 
probably die / I’ll probably die.” 
Although Lamar is oft mistaken 
for a preachy, middle school 
substitute teacher, on DAMN., his 

themes and his lyrics are tightly 
wound, largely internal. Track by 
track, he digs deeper into his own 
black consciousness, distilling the 
conflicting beliefs, influences, and 
obligations into abstract values 
— “PRIDE.,” “LUST.,” “LOVE.,” 
“FEAR.” — never forgetting his 
fleshly physicality — “BLOOD.,” 
“DNA.,” “ELEMENT.” In effect, 
DAMN. is more akin to Lamarian-
stream-of-consciousness 
than 

prototypical “bars.”

Between 
1906 
and 
1907, 

Picasso became spellbound by 
African sculpture and artifact, 
tugged between the refinement 
of classicism and the open bounds 
of 
abstraction. 
Although 
his 

work was not yet full fledged 
cubist, the elements of structural 
decomposition 
and 
reassembly 

intensified. 
Proportions 
exaggerated, 
subject 
form 

morphed; 
the 

palette 
of 
his 

past 
periods 

harmonized. 
Scholars refer to 

this as the Negro Period.

On “Mortal Man,” 2Pac warns, 

“I think that niggas is tired of 
grabbin’ shit out of the stores and 
next time it’s a riot there’s gonna 
be bloodshed, for real. I don’t think 
America know that.”

DAMN. opens with “BLOOD.”
Although we live in one of the 

most animated periods of political 
activism 
in 
recent 
memory, 

Kendrick still looks out and sees 
stagnancy. On “FEEL.” Kendrick 
rhymes “I feel like this gotta be 
the feelin’ ‘Pac was [having] / The 
feelin’ of an apocalypse happenin’ / 
But nothin’ is awkward, the feeling 
won’t prosper / The feelin’ is toxic, 
I feel like I’m boxin’ demons, 
monsters, false prophets, schemin’ 
sponsors, 
industry 
promises, 

niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, 
Compton, Church, religion, token 
black and bondage.”

Lamar is suffocated by what’s 

around him. He is trapped, lost, 
unsure of what more he can do, 
unsure of what more he can change. 
He’s said what needed to be said; 
he’s done what needed to be done. 
Yet, he stills looks out and sees the 
same injustice that inspired him to 
compose To Pimp a Butterfly.

On DAMN., Kendrick comes to 

terms with the fact that he is just 
one rapper, one man, one soul. It 
takes more than one to solve our 
entrenched social tensions, more 
than one to achieve universal 
equality. Lamar has known that 
— all along, he has. Yet, through 
the album’s nested anguish, he 
continues to grapple with his role 
as the face of the ever-evolving 
Black Consciousness. To Pimp 
a Butterfly made its importance 
sufficiently clear, DAMN. marks its 
furthest examination, its highest 
magnification.

His deepest critique of our mass 

social paralysis is on “FEAR.” 
Kendrick’s cousin — Carl — opens 
the track. A devoted Christian, he 
is convicted to the belief that God 
is punishing his family — alleged 
true Israelites — for disobedience. 
Lamar spends the majority of the 
track reflecting on his own fears: 
reminiscing of a home life where 
the threat of domestic abuse 
looms large, recalling the fear of 
dying as a young teen in Compton, 
acknowledging his present worries 
over losing his newfound wealth 
and success. Lamar makes it clear 
that even after he’s left home, even 
after he’s sold his records, even 
after he’s ‘made it,’ he’s still driven 
by fear — to the point that he would 
even smoke it.

DAMN. concludes with a tale 

of a seasoned gangbanger and an 
innocent Kentucky Fried Chicken 
employee. The narrative’s moral: 
free chicken and extra biscuits. 
The simplest of gestures can 

AARURAN CHANDRESEKHAR

Daily Arts Writer

generate 
the 
most 
significant 

change. He concludes: “Whoever 
thought the greatest rapper would 
be from coincidence? Because if 
Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg 
could be servin’ for life, while I 
grew up without a father and die 
in a gunfight.” Just as we’re given 
a penetrating glimpse into one of 
Kendrick’s deepest held truths, 
the final consonant ‘t’ blends into a 
rewind, one that zips back through 
the album, back to Lamar’s first line: 
“So I was taking a walk the other 
day.”

The 
entirety 
of 
DAMN. 

compresses into a snapshot: a single 
snapshot beseeching relisten. So 
we push play, again. Just like that, 
Kendrick is shot, again. We dive into 
his personal struggle, again. And 
just like last the last listen, the album 
ends with another restoration to 
origin. It’s a manifestation of the 
cyclical course of unjust African 
American death. Few still talk 
about Trayvon; few still talk about 
Michael. But in the moment, we 
obsess over the details, we delve into 
the history, we join struggle. We say, 
“this death, this murder, this will 
be one that will change things.” 
But then fear overtakes us. And we 
forget. And the cycle continues.

NETFLIX

Still from new series “13 Reasons Why”
‘13 Reasons Why’ drama 
explores teenage suicide

Includes spoilers and mentions 

of suicide and sexual violence 
including rape. 

In a pretty spot-on adaptation 

of the YA bestseller “Thirteen 
Reasons Why,” the new Netflix 
series follows Clay Jensen as 
he receives a box of cassette 
tapes left on his doorstep and, 
upon pushing play, is greeted 
by the voice of Hannah Baker: 
a classmate, coworker, friend, 
crush and, recently, victim of 
suicide. For the next 13 episodes, 
she explains — “live and in 
stereo” — why she is about to kill 
herself, and we listen.

It’s hard to know where to 

begin with this series, which 
has sparked a lot of debate over 
how this story should have 
been told, or if it should have 
been produced in this medium 
at all. From a purely stylistic 
standpoint, there are times 
when it feels manipulative and 
overly drawn out. Hannah’s 
instructions for the tapes are 
simple: listen to all of them, 
then pass them on to the person 
whose tape is after yours. 
Instead of listening to all the 
tapes at once, Clay takes breaks 
after each one and talks to the 
other students who have heard 
them, 
demanding 
answers, 

apologies or retribution — which 
doesn’t quite make sense, as his 
questions could be answered if 
he just finished listening to the 
tapes the way everyone tells 
him to. This gimmick allows the 
show to last for 13 episodes, and 
leads to Clay seeming more self-
righteous than he does in the 
book. On top of that, there are 
several conversations between 
some of the other kids about 
how they’re going to deal with 
the possibility of the whole 
school learning about Hannah’s 
tapes that feel almost sickening 
in their self-interest, almost to 
the point of feeling unreal. 

But the further into the 

season you get, the more these 
aspects seem to somehow fade 
into the background. The show 
allows us to visualize things that 
the book can’t, like how it feels 
to see the parents of the dead 
girl you bullied and know they 
have no idea about the role you 
played in her life, or how fake it 
can seem to have posters about 
suicide prevention plastered on 
the walls of a high 
school brimming 
with 
pain 
and 

oblivion.

Is “13 Reasons 

Why” raw and 
real, 
or 
is 
it 

romanticized? 
This 
seems 
to 

be the main determinant for 
whether or not this show is 
worth watching, but I don’t 
think there’s a simple answer. 
Some have voiced criticism 
that 
because 
Hannah 
gets 

to tell us her story, the show 
romanticizes suicide; some are 
worried about copycat suicides 
occurring among youth who 
watch the show. Others feel 
that it’s misleading to tell a 
story about suicide without ever 
really engaging with the role 
that mental health plays in the 
large majority of cases. Some 
feel that certain scenes are 
gratuitously graphic, especially 
the rape scenes and, of course, 
Hannah’s suicide itself.

Personally, I haven’t figured 

out what I think or feel about 
this show. When I read the 
book in high school, I felt like 
it got a lot right about how it 
feels to be in Hannah’s or Clay’s 
position, and showed just how 
shitty high school and high 
schoolers can be. It conveyed 
just how disconnected adults 
can be from the lives of their 
children or students and, just as 
importantly, how dangerous it is 
to keep subtly blaming victims 
of sexual assault for their own 
assaults. It’s weird to watch the 
show now, being in that strange 
place between adolescence and 

adulthood; I fully understand 
the concern surrounding it.

But I also think it’s a story 

worth telling. No, the show does 
not discuss whether Hannah 
has issues with her mental 
health, but a lot of the criticism 
I’ve seen of this show based 
on that aspect seems to gloss 
over how deeply painful and 
isolating Hannah’s experience 
of being bullied was. Some 

articles 
don’t 

even 
mention 

the fact that she 
was 
raped 
— 

something I find 
incredibly, deeply 
disturbing.

Something 

makes me want 

to defend this show, despite 
its faults, but I’m not sure 
why, and I’m not sure to what 
length or if I’m right to feel 
that way. Maybe it’s all of the 
comments I’ve read under 
think pieces about it from 
parents who are watching it 
with their kids and using it as a 
jumping off point to talk about 
bullying, 
sexual 
violence 

and male entitlement to the 
bodies of girls and women 
and suicide. Maybe it’s the 
fact that it represents at least 
soame kind of exposure to 
stories that so often get buried 
with their owners. Maybe it’s 
the fact that by talking about 
what this show does wrong, 
we can get closer to talking 
about how we — as friends, 
as classmates, as parents, as 
school 
administrators 
and 

counselors — can do better. 
Because like it or not, it 
does nothing to talk about 
how artistic portrayals of 
suicide are incorrect without 
discussing the problems of 
how we talk about bullying, 
sexual violence and mental 
health

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I’m not going to compare my 

college graduation to the series 
finale of a TV show.

It’s common knowledge that 

everyone who likes TV sees their 
own life as a TV show. We see 
ourselves as the protagonist of 
an indie movie, complete with 
romantic subplots and a built-in 
coming-of-age narrative. If you’re 
a person who watches a lot of TV, 
it’s impossible to avoid looking at 
graduation — whether it’s from 
high school or college or med 
school or anything — as a series 
finale of sorts.

That’s how it was for me 

during my senior year of high 
school, anyway. I knew relatively 
early on where I’d be going to 
college the following year, and 
that allowed me to experience 
most of the year as sentimentally 
as possible. I hung out with my 
friends all the time, savoring the 
time I had left with them. I wrote 
heartfelt notes on the back of 
wallet-size senior pictures and 
told people what they meant to 
me, even wrote full letters to some 
as they left to move into their 
new dorms. I’m embarrassed to 
admit it, but I actually tabulated 
a list of my friends, complete with 
schedules of how often to keep 
in contact with them based on 
what ‘friendship tier’ they fit in. 
My very closest friends belonged 
in the ‘talk to every 
week’ category, while 
my good friends were 
‘text every two to 
four weeks,’ and my 
vague tertiary friends 
were ‘text every now 
and then.’ I thought 
I could keep a strict 
schedule in order to maintain my 
various high school friendships.

Of course, that didn’t happen. 

I think I failed the first week I 
moved away. As I would learn 
over the course of college, and as 
I’m still learning now, endings 
can never be perfect. Closure isn’t 
always possible, and sometimes 
things must come to an end 
without a tidy resolution. The end 
of college is, of course, also the 
beginning of something new and 
exciting, but it’s wrong to pretend 
it isn’t the end of something 
important and irreplaceable.

My senior year of college has 

been imperfect in a way that 
high school never was. The 
pressure of post-grad plans has 
hung over everyday life like an 
ominous cloud, preventing me 
from fully feeling the weight of 
everything, from processing the 
fact that it’s all actually ending. 
Besides, college endings are 
weird and anticlimactic — back 
in middle school, on the last 
day of school, we’d all sign each 
other’s yearbooks, and at least 
in high school we all had the 
same last day of school, the same 
prom, the same graduation date. 
In college, people all move out 
at different times depending on 
their final exam schedules and 
their summer plans. There’s 
no climactic day when you can 
deliver your perfect goodbye to 
everyone you care about.

Last night, I watched the 

series finale of “Girls.” “Girls” 
has never precisely been about 
college, but the journey Hannah 
Horvath (Lena Dunham, “Tiny 
Furniture”) goes on seems to 
parallel my own, in some ways. 
It’s a coming-of-age story about a 
young woman whose perspective 
of the world and herself shifts 
over the years. I started watching 
“Girls” the summer before its 
third season aired, which also 
meant the summer before college 
began for me. It feels fitting that 
the show is coming to an end just 
as my college experience comes to 
an end.

The series finale of “Girls” 

was 
an 
anticlimactic 
affair, 

filled with low-key moments 
of connection and growth. If 
“Girls” had a bombastic ending 
with massive leaps of character 
development, it’d be disingenuous 
to the spirit of the show, which 
has always been concerned with 
emotional realism. The closest 
“Girls” got to a traditional sitcom 
ending, complete with satisfying 
emotional catharsis, was actually 

the penultimate episode. And 
even that was hardly conventional 
— sure, all four of the main 
characters appeared onscreen for 
the first time in more than a year, 
but the scene ended with them 
decisively ending their friendship. 
These women have outgrown 
each other, and the show is bold 
enough to suggest that they were 
never there for each other in the 
first place.

Many times this past year, I’ve 

craved big moments of finality, 
sappy 
reminiscing 
sessions 

with friends and huge personal 
revelations, 
like 
the 
crowd-

pleasing series finales of shows 
like “Friends,” “The Office” and 
“Parks and Recreation.”

I’ve managed to have a couple. 

One night at a party I bonded 
with my friend Sam, talking 
honestly about heartbreak when 
the only things we’d really talked 
about before that were TV and 
movies. A week ago, I spent a full 
day with my close friend Shev, 
hammocking in the breezy spring 
weather and just talking for 
hours. My fantasy this year was 
to have a day like that with each 
of my friends, a day after which 
I could safely feel like we’d given 
our friendships the attention they 
deserved.

But I’m sensing the end of 

college, in reality, will be more like 

the finale of “Girls.” 
In “Girls,” Hannah 
didn’t reach perfect 
moments of closure 
with most of the 
characters. She made 
peace, to a degree, 
with her ex-boyfriend 
Adam and her ex-best 

friend Jessa, but it’s unlikely 
they’ll ever be close again. She 
almost completely forgot about 
her old friend Shoshanna, and 
her friendship with Elijah will 
remain long-distance as long as 
he’s pursuing showbiz fame in 
New York City. She hasn’t talked 
to her ex-coworker Ray since she 
awkwardly tried to give him road 
head and he crashed the truck. 
Even her best friend Marnie 
is still self-centered, helping 
Hannah raise her baby just to give 
her own life meaning.

Some people will criticize 

this ending as incomplete and 
unsatisfying. But “Girls” is a 
purposely untidy show, based 
on incremental growth and a 
realistic lack of easy closure. It 
reflects my life better than those 
closure-heavy 
sitcoms. 
The 

ending of “Girls” is imperfect, 
just like my own senior year. I 
haven’t connected with all the 
people I’ve wanted to this year. 
I’ve failed to stay in touch with 
some of my favorite friends. On 
the positive side, I’ve continued 
to form connections with new 
people, even in the last month of 
my senior year — but that’s untidy 
in its own way, because I’m sad 
I won’t be able to build on those 
new friendships when I leave Ann 
Arbor. These are some of the same 
imperfections that riddle the last 
season of “Girls.”

And here I am now, comparing 

my senior year to a final season 
even though I said I wouldn’t do 
that. Old habits.

Here’s what I know: If my 

college experience was a TV 
show, the series finale wouldn’t 
show the moment I throw my 
cap into the air or hug my best 
friends goodbye. It wouldn’t 
show a flashforward to the 
moment I step out of a plane 
and see Manhattan in the flesh 
(and hell, I don’t know when that 
flashforward would even be set 
— maybe a month from now, or 
maybe a year, or maybe never).

It would show something 

more subtle, like the shot that 
closes “Girls,” with Hannah’s 
subtle expression of confidence 
and accomplishment. My series 
finale would end on something 
quiet and intimate, like closing 
my laptop at the arts desk, 
or biting into a slice of South 
U pizza, or laughing at some 
stupid meme. Or maybe I’d 
just be sitting alone in bed, 
watching the end of one of my 
favorite TV shows, smiling a bit 
as the credits started to roll.

College, TV & 
the imperfect 
closing scene

Blanco providing spark at the plate

Michigan first baseman Tera 

Blanco came to the plate in the top 
of the first inning last Wednesday 
with a runner on second base and a 
two-run cushion already in tow.

Blanco patiently worked a 3-2 

count before finding her pitch; she 
didn’t miss. Keeping her weight 
back, she blasted the fastball to 
center, rocketing what appeared 
to be a shot headed for Yost and 
beyond. 

But the ball plummeted just 

feet too short, allowing Michigan 
State centerfielder Lea Foerster to 
make a spectacular leaping grab 
just left of the “222” sign under the 
flagpole, indicating the deepest 
part of the ballpark. It may have 
been frustrating for Blanco at the 
time, but the result didn’t mar the 
progress that has become apparent 
in her approach at the plate.

This type of approach — one 

complete with high contact level, 
pitch recognition and patience 
— hasn’t been there for the 
Wolverines’ fans to see since last 
year’s Women’s College World 
Series.

In her next at-bat, in the third 

inning, 
the 
Spartans 
wanted 

nothing to do with Blanco — 
walking her on five pitches with 
first base open and two outs. 
Neglecting to force the issue, 
Blanco took her base, extending 
an inning that very well may have 
halted there just weeks ago. Two 
batters later, a bases-loaded walk 
of junior infielder Amanda Vargas 
would tack on another run and 
extend the lead to four.

While Blanco’s day may appear 

inconsequential in the scorebook — 
no hits, no runs batted in, one walk, 
one run scored — her approach 
offered more evidence of a player 
breaking out when her team needs 
it most.

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 

believes her improved mentality 
has led to her across-the-board 
improvement.

“Tera has done her part and 

embraced pitching,” Hutchins said. 
“She wants to win and wants to 
be good. She’s improved in every 
category and most importantly in 
attitude.”

It’s been no secret that the 

junior first baseman/right-hander 
has underperformed at the plate 

relative to expectations. Blanco 
was perhaps the second-most 
productive Wolverine hitter last 
season, behind only Sierra Romero. 

After a monstrous 2016 season — 

.404 average, 66 RBI, 12 home runs, 
.537 on-base percentage, etc. — 
Blanco was slotted into the middle 
of the order to start the season. 
With a young offense now devoid of 
the same firepower that headlined 
the 2016 lineup, Blanco, at least, 
could assuredly be counted on.

Until she couldn’t.
Perhaps her increased role in the 

circle affected her, perhaps it didn’t.

Perhaps it was unfair to expect 

the same production at the plate 
— alongside her role in the circle — 
 

right away, perhaps it wasn’t.

Blanco admits that the increased 

workload has an impact mentally, 
though she has readily denied that 
the dual role directly affects her 
performance.

“It’s something I’ve had to get 

used to this year, but I really enjoy 
it,” Blanco said earlier in the season. 
“I love being in the lineup and 
having to make an impact on the 
game. It’s a lot to handle mentally, 
probably, I think that’s the biggest 
thing.” 

She took that same approach 

into the weekend series against 
Maryland, this time with better 
statistical success.

Deadlocked in a 1-1 tie in the 

top of the fifth inning Sunday, 
Blanco stepped in with a runner 
in scoring position and two outs. 
She identified her pitch, knocking a 
sharp single back up the middle to 
bring in the go-ahead run.

This time, there was no robbing 

Blanco of her production.

And really, the game against the 

Terrapins was just one part of a 
larger trend.

Over the last 15 games — a 

significant sample size — Blanco 
has posted a .382 average, with 16 
RBI. In addition, her 10 walks and 
just three strikeouts over the same 
span are a testament to a more 
patient approach that has keyed the 
turnaround.

While it’s not certain what was 

hindering Blanco at the begining of 
the season, what is apparent are the 
changes that she has shown lately.

The changes Blanco has noticed; 

the changes Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins has noticed; the changes 
that just may change the course of 
the Wolverines’ season.

BASEBALL
Michigan preparing
for Michigan State

The No. 13 Michigan baseball 

team (6-3 Big Ten, 29-7 overall) 
will 
face 

in-state 
rival 

Michigan 
State 
in 
a 

midweek 
matchup 
Tuesday. 
While 
this 

contest 
is 

considered 
a 
non-

conference 
game — a full 
Big Ten series 
will be played 
later 
in 
the 

season 
— 
it 

will provide a 
strong test for 
the surging Wolverines. 

Michigan is coming off a 

sweep of No. 18 Oklahoma, 
while the Spartans (5-4, 20-12) 
dropped their series finale 
Sunday against Ohio State after 
taking the first two games.

Tuesday’s game figures to 

produce a high number of hits 
and runs, with both teams 
leading the Big Ten in batting 
average — the Wolverines are 
first with a .294 average and 
the Spartans come in a close 
second at .293.

Michigan’s 
current 
hot 

hitters 
include 
sophomore 

second baseman Ako Thomas, 
batting .350, and sophomore 
designated hitter Nick Poirier, 
batting .324, sitting in the first 
and seventh slot of the lineup, 
respectively. The Wolverines’ 
squad 
is 
deep, 
something 

Michigan State is no stranger 
to.

Outfielder Brandon Hughes 

leads the Spartans with a 
.336 average, and it doesn’t 
get much worse from there 
— catcher Matt Byars rounds 
out the team with the lowest 
batting average of the starters, 
yet still bats .263.

Michigan’s 
offense 

sputtered during last Tuesday’s 
matchup 
against 
Eastern 

Michigan, but fortunately for 
the Wolverines, their defense 

was as sharp as ever. This 
has become a common theme 
for Michigan, as it leads the 
Big Ten with a .984 fielding 
percentage.

But after the Wolverines’ 

impressive 
win 
over 
the 

Sooners on Sunday — when 
Michigan recorded 17 hits — it 
may be back to top offensive 
performance.

Getting a lot of hits will be 

no easy task against a strong 
Michigan State pitching staff, 
though. The Spartans sit third 
in the Big Ten with a team 3.43 
earned-run 
average. 
Right-

hander 
Mike 
Mokma 
will 

most likely be on the bump for 
Tuesday’s game and he enters 
the game with a 2.77 ERA.

On the hill for the Wolverines 

will 
be 
junior 
left-hander 

Michael Hendrickson. He is 
the normal Sunday starter for 
Michigan, but after he suffered 
a broken nose last week, junior 
right-hander Alec Rennard had 
to step in. Hendrickson needed 
the extra couple of days to 
rest, but Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich assured he will be ready 
for Tuesday’s game.

While Hendrickson has a 

4.25 ERA, he has the experience 
of a weekend starter and has 
played against the Wolverines’ 
toughest opponents.

And for the most part, the 

Michigan’s toughest opponents 
are Michigan State’s as well. 
The Wolverines and Spartans 
have 
many 
common 
foes, 

the most recent being Notre 
Dame, Eastern Michigan and 
Western Michigan. Michigan 
defeated all three, whereas 
Michigan State fell to each, 
with all of the games being 
midweek 
matchups. 
The 

Spartans have not been strong 
in midweek games as of late, 
dropping their last three by 
one run each.

The Wolverines on the other 

hand have proven they can 
win the close games, as their 
last two midweek games were 
both won by one run each. If 
Tuesday’s game is close, the 
Wolverines’ prowess in close 
games seem to give them the 
advantage.

Junior first baseman Tera Blanco has managed to post a .382 average over the last 15 games — a sign of improvement at the plate that the Wolverines needed. 
‘M’ looking to sweep Spartans

With its perfect record at 

Alumni Field on the line last 
week, the Michigan softball 
team managed a 5-1 win over 
Michigan State, thanks to an 
effort that saw the Wolverines 
tally twice as many hits as the 
Spartans. Right-hander Megan 
Betsa 
tossed 
17 
strikeouts, 

matching 
her 
career-best 

performance in the circle. 

On Tuesday, the 18th-ranked 

Wolverines (11-2 Big Ten, 31-9-
1 overall) will look to complete 
the season sweep against their 
in-state foe just a week later.

Both Michigan and Michigan 

State (5-8, 21-16-0) have hit 
bumps in the road since their 
last encounter.

While 
it 
appeared 
the 

Wolverines 
— 
the 
then-top 

team in the conference this 
past weekend — would have 
little trouble routing Maryland, 
this was not the case. The 
Terrapins robbed Michigan of a 
series sweep with a 2-1 victory 
Saturday, 
even 
though 
the 

Spartans had swept Maryland 
just two weeks ago.

As the Wolverine offense was 

unable to jumpstart Saturday, 
the lineup saw significant shifts 
for Sunday’s game. The changes 
seemed to pay off, as a seventh-
inning rally allowed Michigan 
to overcome Maryland, 4-3, 
eking out the 2-1 series victory.

“I’m glad we got through 

it,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins after the series. 

One point of consistency that 

has been the Wolverines’ saving 
grace throughout the season is 
the performance of Betsa. The 
ace notched two complete-game 
victories in the circle, tossing 
26 more strikeouts, boosting 
her total on the season to 292 — 
good for No. 1 in the nation.

“Megan’s been a rock for 

us,” Hutchins said. “She’s our 
leader. She’s throwing right 
now with an offense that’s 
underperforming. So she’s got 
to have nerves of steel, and I was 
really proud of her. I thought she 
really had a gutsy performance 
(Sunday).”

Michigan 
State 
faced 

struggles of its own on the 
weekend.

Though 
the 
Spartans 

intended to host Illinois at its 
own Secchia Softball Stadium, 
flooding prevented this from 
happening, and their matchups 
were instead held at Davenport 
University. The field has been 
an issue all season, and now 
water damage has Michigan 
State’s infield and outfield to be 
replaced.

The Spartans were swept 

by 
the 
Illini, 
including 
a 

heartbreaker Saturday in which 
Michigan State took Illinois 
to extra innings, but ended 
up falling, 6-5. The Spartans 
are now on a four-game losing 
streak.

It is clear that both teams 

are looking for a spark heading 
into Tuesday’s game, though the 
Spartans may need it more.

But with some recent low 

points — a game dropped to 
Ohio State and a game dropped 
to Maryland — it will be pivotal 
that the Wolverines come into 
the game with confidence.

And if they can beat Michigan 

State, that confidence could also 
be important to carry over for 
Michigan heading into next 
weekend’s series against Big 
Ten competitor Wisconsin.
