This LSA senior is a model 

University of Michigan student.

Raised in a family of educators, 

she is beyond attentive in class, 
constantly present during office 
hours and dedicates respect to her 
teachers — she is someone who 
cares deeply about how she earns 
her grade in a class. She said she 
is also an anxious student, to the 
point of being a perfectionist.

It felt like it was these traits, she 

said, that were taken advantage of 
by her GSI when he harassed her 
and several other female students 
in her Communications class. 
But what is also comes across 
surprising to the LSA senior, along 
with others, is the lack of follow-up 
from the administration after they 
spoke about their experiences.

It was the first semester of her 

junior year in the 2016 fall semester 
and she was taking a class with 
Assistant 
Professor 
Muzammil 

Hussain. 
After 
a 
particularly 

difficult exam and an upcoming 
project, the LSA senior and her 
group were directed to meet with 
their graduate student instructor, 
Naz Khan. Khan was also a law 
school student.

Sitting in Espresso Royale after 

class, Khan and the group talked 
for two hours, the LSA senior 
said, and nothing was related to 
class. When she said she needed 
dinner, he offered to take them to a 
restaurant so they could talk about 
the project they had not touched 
on enough. The senior and her 
female group member wondered 
if that was even allowed. She said 
he assured them it was normal for 
student conferences.

There was still no discussion of 

the class. He began talking about 
past relationships.

She said he asked a question 

that implied what the potential 
consequences of having a sexual 
relationship with a student would 
be.

“I literally was like, ‘I cannot 

believe you just said that,’” she said. 
“And he was like, ‘No, no, no, I don’t 
have someone in mind.’ He was 
sitting next to me and I was like, I 
can’t even look at him right now.”

She 
recalled 
some 
of 
the 

inappropriate dialogue of that 
night. 

“Oh my God … this was the 

worst part,” she said. “And he said 
something like, ‘I think about ass 
and titties all the time.’ And my 
friend and I were like, ‘I’m sorry?’ I 
literally was like, jaw-dropped, like, 
I can’t even believe these words are 
coming out of your mouth. And he 
just laughed and he was, like, very 
much treating us like we were in no 
way students.”

At the end of the dinner, the girls 

tried to pay, but he took the bill. 
She said she felt compelled to stay 
because she felt like her grade was 
in question.

“I was having this horrible 

internal conflict knowing, like, 
this is incredibly wrong,” she said. 
“And yet he’s totally using that 
because he knows that that would 
work (with someone like me). I was 
very aware of the fact that, like, 
there was some manipulation and 
I was falling for it … That was the 
weirdest part.”

After the dinner, she said she 

had other homework and was 
going to another restaurant to 
work on it. The GSI continued the 
conversation — following the girls 
there.

“I shouldn’t care about more an 

A than I care about my agency and 
yet it was still enough to get me to 
stay there,” she said. 

Later that night, the LSA senior 

said she had to go home. Despite 
her insistence she could walk alone, 
she said the GSI walked her to her 
apartment building. Once at her 
apartment, she said he kept trying 
to stall. She said once she checked 
her phone, she realized it was dead.

“I didn’t expect to be as afraid 

of that as I was in that moment,” 
she said. “Like, so then I was like 
really checking my watch. And 
he was like, ‘Stop checking your 
watch’ … And then I was at one 

point I literally yelled at him, I 
was like, ‘No, stop. I have to go 
upstairs, I have to go to bed, I have 
registration for classes at 8:00 a.m., 
I need to go to bed,’ and he like 
laughed and was like, ‘Fine, fine.’”

But before she could go up, 

the GSI pulled up Facebook and 

showed her pictures of a girl in her 
discussion section.

“He was like, ‘I mean, she’s 

decent in class but look how pretty 
she looks in there,’” she said. “He 
was like, ‘Yeah, I looked at all of you 
on Facebook before.’”

ACADEMICS

As a student at the University 

of Michigan, 2008 alum Aisa 
Villarosa fell in love with 
the 
Asian/Pacific 
Islander 

American Studies Program — 
housed in the American Culture 
Department 
— 
because 
it 

allowed her to learn about other 
cultures and her own heritage; 
she learned lessons she hadn’t 
been exposed to growing up in 
the majority-white suburbs of 
Detroit. 

She said she owes this great 

experience in A/PIA Studies 
to faculty members, including 
longtime 
Lecturer 
Emily 

Lawsin. 
Lawsin 
has 
been 

teaching at the University since 
2000.

“The number one thing is 

just how amazing the A/PIA 
Studies faculty are — the ones 
that built our experience as 
undergraduates,” 
Villarosa 

explained.

When news began to surface 

earlier this year about the 
American Culture and Women’s 
Studies Departments’ decision 
to not renew Lawsin’s contract, 
Villarosa took action.

Villarosa is now an attorney, 

and aided in the drafting of 
updates, fact sheets and a viral 
petition on Lawsin’s case. These 
documents can all be found 
on the A/PIA Alumni Tumblr 
page, organized by a coalition of 

A/PIA alumni.

“I think that (Lawsin) is just a 

really special mentor,” Villarosa 
said. “So, it’s been quite easy for 
me to say, ‘Hey, I do have a job, 
or hey, I have these other things 
going on,’ but I would support 
her in a heartbeat. And I think 
that many other folks also feel 
the same and it’s been edited 
in the petition, the website, 
the Tumblr — these are all just 
voluntary things, but we are 
happy to do them.”

Villarosa, 
who 
wrote 

an op-ed published in The 
Daily earlier this month, said 
she is especially disheartened 
because the A/PIA program 
was so strong during her time 
as a University student, and she 

does not see it as the same now.

powerful

the

The Ann Arbor City Council 

convened 
Monday 
evening 

to vote on a $4.2 million 
repurchase of the “Y Lot,” the 
former site of the local YMCA 
on Fifth Avenue, from local 
real estate developer Dennis 
Dahlmann. The city originally 
bought the land in 2003 and 
Dahlmann purchased it four 
years ago. The council voted to 
postpone the resolution until 
April 23, when they will vote in 
a closed session. The legislation 
amends the budget to not 
exceed the $4.2 million from the 
General Fund.

Councilmember Jane Lumm, 

I-Ward 2, emphasized the vote’s 
postponement will allow the 
Council to properly review the 
implications of the decision and 
the legal risks of the project.

“I’m glad we’re going to take 

the time and I think there are 
important objectives to achieve 
in postponement,” Lumm said. 
“I would like to see resolving 
any litigation and avoid risks 

associated with the city holding 
this property for a long period 
of time and also avoid the 
possibility of nothing happening 
on this property and I will be 
sending some recommendations 

for some milestones because 
I think it’s imperative that we 
understand what it would take 
to proceed with the project and 
withdraw the lawsuit or the 
complaint.”

Four years ago, Dahlmann 

bought the 0.8-acre property 
for $5.25 million and pledged 
to revive the vacant lot with 
affordable 
housing 
and

Starting fall 2018, the University 

of Michigan will partner with 
Barnes & Noble College on a new 
textbook supplier program that 
works to increase convenient 
textbook 
purchases, 
rentals 

and returns on campus. The 
partnership will also reportedly 
assist students with textbook 
affordability and provide various 
price options for conditions of 
returned books.

The

will 
make 

Barnes & Noble the primary 
textbook dealer for the University, 
requiring the retailer to stock all 
textbooks and materials requested 
by professors for their classes.

I have a lawsuit 

against the 
University. 
It’s clear that 
this is an act of 

retaliation. 

See A/PIA, Page 3
See GSI, Page 3

See B&N, Page 3
See CAPS, Page 2


CAPS campus statistics are 
consistent with the trends 
in the Nature Biotechnology 
study.

“We 
are 
also 
seeing 
a 

sustained increase in graduate 
students 
accessing 
CAPS 

services with issues of anxiety 
and 
depression 
identified 

as top concerns,” Monschau 
wrote.

Monschau said 31 percent of 

CAPS services were provided 
to graduate students, of the 
4,638 students serviced in 
total. CAPS has begun to 
target 
graduate 
students 

by providing mental health 
services 
specific 
to 
their 

college, 
positioning 
CAPS 

services within the specific 
University graduate schools. 
These embedded psychologists 
allow professionals to tailor 
their services to the unique 

graduate 
experiences 
of 

students.

“In 
tandem 
with 
the 

extensive work at the CAPS 
main office, the Rackham 
embedded psychologist role 
provides 
counseling 
and 

outreach/work programming 
around 
themes 
unique 
to 

graduate student life, including 
imposter syndrome, increased 
competitiveness of academic 
positions post-degree, stress 
around 
work/life 
balance 

as a graduate students and 
 

feelings 
of 
burnout 
and 

vulnerability,” 
Monschau 

wrote.

Monschau 
emphasized 

the 
different 
experiences 

of 
graduate 
students. 

Students from international 
and 
underrepresented 

communities, she said, are 
reported to have increased 
mental health concerns related 
to microaggressions.

“We see many graduate 

students 
being 
forced 
to 

navigate both the inevitable 
and 
increasing 
pressures 

of 
academic 
life 
demands 

embedded 
in 
a 
volatile 

and 
stressful 
overarching 

political 
environment,” 

Monschau 
wrote. 
“All 
of 

these stressors are greatly 
impacting graduate students 
and the intersectionality of 
these pressures are greatly 
increasing 
vulnerability 
to 

stress, lack of motivation, 
diminished concentration and 
burnout, but to anxiety and 
depression as well.”

Public 
Health 
graduate 

student Alexandra Babcock, 
a graduate student leader for 
Wolverine Support Network, 
said she doesn’t think an 
increase 
in 
mental 
health 

problems 
is 
as 
much 
an 

issue as awareness of these 
concerns.

“I think a lot of the problems 

and struggles have existed and 
people have been suffering 
in silence,” Babcock said. “I 

think it’s what people are 
going to be uncovering.”

Babcock 
said 
the 

rigorous academics of the 
University, research and 
searching for jobs along 
with 
personal 
pressure 

are 
risk 
factors 
she’s 

identified.

“I think striking the 

balance 
can 
be 
very 

overwhelming as well as 
the struggles of people 
moving to a new area,” 
Babcock 
said. 
“They 

move to a new location 
and you have to restart 
your life and that new 
and uncertain thing and 
not knowing what your 
resources are … Coupled 
with the rigors of the 
program and the academia 
are 
challenging 
when 

you don’t have a support 
system right away.”

Babcock 
said 
she 

thinks 
the 
University 

is aware of and values 
students’ mental health 
and is working to make 
sure those resources are 
available for students. She 

said some schools — such as 
Rackham — have embedded 
CAPS resources, but hopes 
more 
schools 
can 
have 

psychological services.

“The 
pressure 
in 
the 

future will be to make sure 
the resources are adequate 
and increasing the resources 
available to students,” Babcock 
said. “I think students see a 
lot of the organizations are 
flexible and it’s just making 
students 
feel 
comfortable 

when they need support or 
help.”

Social 
Work 
student 

Catherine Perez, a member 
of “We Are People Too,” an 
organization supporting Social 
Work student mental health, 
said she sees resources for 
anxiety and depression among 
young adults improving.

“I think that now it’s being 

diagnosed more and people are 
actually seeking mental health 
services,” Perez said. “I think 
the stigma has decreased a 
little bit.”

Perez said mental health 

can specifically be a concern 
in the Social Work community 
because students are tasked 
with taking care of others 
and forgetting to take care of 
themselves.

“Mental health matters,” 

Perez 
said. 
“Social 
Work 

students 
are 
‘superheroes’ 

helping 
their 
clients 
and 

we fail to have self-care for 
ourselves and we just wanted 
to 
build 
a 
community 
to 

support each other and talk 
about our own struggles with 
mental health.”

Perez said mental health 

concerns stem from a build-
up of attempting to balance 
life and work and students feel 
there is too much to do and too 
little time.

“Especially 
among 
grad 

students and Ph.D. students, 
we are supposed to be very 
self-driven and there isn’t too 
much support from the staff, 
whereas 
undergrads 
have 

more support; you have to 
navigate it more on your own,” 
Perez said.

commercial 
developments. 

However, in February, Dahlmann 
sued the city for his failed 
development plans in hopes to 
gain an additional four years of 
ownership to complete his plans.

At the previous meeting last 

week, the Council was split with 
seven in favor and three opposed. 
Councilmembers 
Jack 
Eaton, 

D-Ward 4, Sumi Kailasapathy, 
D-Ward 1, and Anne Bannister, 
D-Ward 1, all opposed the lot 
purchase. The council also met 
twice during closed sessions to 
discuss the litigation.

Ann Arbor resident Greg Pratt 

supported the resolution in hopes 
that the city will develop the land 
with affordable housing for Ann 
Arbor residents.

“We have the opportunity right 

now to do what’s right to create a 
space downtown for people who 
have been pushed out,” Pratt said. 
“I think that we should purchase 
the land and put affordable 
housing there, workforce housing. 
People need the housing now and 
the time is now to do it.”

Ann Arbor resident Paquetta 

Pratt further highlighted the need 
for wider inclusion through these 
affordable 
housing 
measures 

and believes the city can correct 

its previous mistakes in earlier 
purchase deals.

“Unless you can afford the 

almost $1,000 or more for a one-
bedroom apartment, then you are 
going to be excluded from this 
community,” Pratt said. “Even 
though yes, maybe the city did do 
the wrong thing waiting all this 
time, you can rectify it by doing 
it now. We need the housing now 
and we really need it.”

However, Ann Arbor resident 

Elizabeth Nelson opposed the 
resolution. Based on the previous 
purchase history of the land in 
2003, she believes the City has 
not made any strides to develop 
realistic development goals.

“I want to know from this 

group how buying the ‘Y Lot’ now 
will be different from the last time 
the city bought it in 2003 because 
in 2003 the city had very specific 
goals in buying it related to 
affordable housing and I haven’t 
heard anyone yet pin down a goal 
for city ownership in buying this 
property,” Nelson said. “Rattling 
off every possibility is not a goal 
… Declaring its potential value 
is not a goal — the lot had value 
when the city first bought it in 
2003, too.”

On 
the 
other 
hand, 
Ann 

Arbor resident Jessica Letaw 
supported the resolution because 
she believes it will revitalize 

downtown Ann Arbor and create 
a more diverse economic and 
residential community.

“Diversity of youths is the key to 

unlocking downtown’s potential 
as a focus of economic and social 
activity,” Letaw said. “A core 
goal is to encourage a diversity of 
downtown housing opportunities 
and 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 

downtown resident population to 
strengthen the downtown’s role 
as urban neighborhood and public 
investments 
and 
development 

compliment to private sector 
resident investments.”

Ann Arbor resident Andrew 

Stumpff was also in favor of 
the resolution due to potential 

economic benefits and increase 
in Ann Arbor property value over 
the past four years.

“We know that four years ago 

that this property was worth 
on the market a million more 
than the price the city has the 
opportunity to buy it,” Stumpff 
said. “During the last four years 
the value of Ann Arbor real estate 
has not declined. This property 
is not worth less than the $5.2 
million in 2014. Data shows a 35 
percent increase in those four 
years … The best estimate we 
now have of this lot is now $10 
million.”

She further explained that he 

knew looking for students “would 
be a problem,” according to the 
LSA senior. She said he told her 
that he knew she was in a sorority 
and that he had to “watch out for 
you guys.”

The LSA senior, at this point, 

saw someone leave her building 
and she immediately ran in, saying 
goodbye. In her apartment, she 
checked the time. 1:20 a.m.

She received several texts from 

him (Khan had his students text 
him to schedule office hours).

“I 
just 
want 
to 
stop 

communicating,” she said. “But in 
my head I also had the light again, 
like he could (hurt my grade). He 
(implied to me) a million times 
tonight, ‘I have entire authority 
over your whole grade.’”

Later, he texted her that he just 

graded her exam and that she did 
very well. The text read, “Kind of 
makes me think you motherfuckers 
listen to my rants.”

The LSA senior said she wanted 

to call her mom, but didn’t want 
her mother to get angry at her for 
not walking away.

In the morning, she said she 

woke up to another text from him, 
this time reminding her to register 
for classes and that he could grab 
dinner with them again.

She said she missed discussion 

that day and met with Hussain, 
the class professor. Her email 
referenced another recently filed 
student complaint against Khan.

In emails obtained by The Daily, 

she wrote, “This has been weighing 
on me for about 1.5 weeks now, 
and I know some sort of action 
is already underway, but I would 
really like to meet with you to talk 
about my experience with Naz.”

She said during her discussion 

with Hussain, he was visibly upset 
with her story even before she 
discussed how Khan’s behavior 
veered 
towards 
inappropriate 

behavior. She said she was pleased 
how supportive he was in the 
process.

She said she also met with 

Title IX coordinators, including 
Pamela Heatlie, associate vice 
provost for Academic and Faculty 
Affairs, and Alexandra Matish, 
associate director of Academic 
Human Resources. The LSA senior 
said during her meeting with the 
officers—in which she recounted 
her experiences rather than filing a 
formal report— they appeared to be 
more concerned with how Khan’s 
actions violated GSI academic 
policy rather than the harassment. 
She said they asked more questions 
about his academic behavior.

“They seemed to be more upset 

about the schoolwork,” she said.

She also explained she did not 

get to tell her whole story — though 
she did send them a full written 
draft of her experience. She 
clarified OIE staff did not appear 
intentionally uninterested in her 
story, but were more concerned 
about the details and the timeline 
of that night.

“They are not counselors. It 

didn’t shock me,” she said, further 
saying that they were welcoming 
in their the conversation. At that 
point, the LSA senior said she had 
told her story so many times, she 
wasn’t as anxious. 

She didn’t follow up with the 

coordinators she spoke with, she 
said, but she did not get an update 
either. However, the LSA senior 
said she didn’t expect Khan to still 
be around following her complaint.

“I passed him on the street this 

year and had a mini-panic attack, 
like, in the 30 seconds that we 
passed each other … But he didn’t 
say anything to me,” she said. “I 
don’t even know if he recognized 
who it was, but I called my friend 
and she was like ‘Yes, he’s still 
around and I see him at the gym 
all the time,’ so I don’t go to the 
IM Building (Intramural Sports 
Building) because I am really not 
trying to run into him in any other 
circumstances.”

As it turns out, a very similar 

story 
was 
happening 
to 
her 

classmate.

Earlier 
this 
semester, 
the 

University released its 2017 report 
on prohibited student conduct, 
finding a 40 percent increase in 
reported misconduct from the 
previous year. The Office for 
Institutional 
Equity 
received 

281 reports and conducted 28 
investigations.

The OIE concluded after 28 

investigations that eight policy 
violations occurred over the past 
year. The cases comprised five 
sexual assaults, two incidents of 
stalking and a violation of interim 
measures. The report stated the 
OIE carried out disciplinary action 
for these violations, including 
educational measures, restriction, 
suspension and expulsion.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said though there is no 
way to determine a definitive cause 
for the increase in reports but 
that an increase isn’t inherently 
negative 
— 
an 
increase 
can 

signify heightened support for 
survivors and more awareness 
of the University’s system for 
investigating assault.

“Reports go up each year, 

but that is possibly a good sign,” 
Fitzgerald said in an interview 
with The Daily from January.

In a Februrary interview with 

The Daily, Heatlie commented on 
the proportion of appeals cases.

“I 
don’t 
know 
what 

normal would be under these 
circumstances,” 
Heatlie 
said. 

“Unlike, for example, a court 
system where only the party 
doesn’t appeal. In our system, 
either system can appeal.”

She said reasons why many 

people may not report incidents 
they experience vary on a case-by-
case basis.

It’s been a year since Heatlie 

was hired as a Title IX coordinator. 
She previously worked as the 
associate director in the OIE and 
before that, she was a general 
assistant 
counsel 
at 
Oakland 

University.

Heatlie 
was 
previously 

embroiled in a 2000 scandal at 
the University of Vermont, where 
hockey players were partaking 
in severe hazing. The Vermont 
Attorney General criticized the 
administration’s handling of the 
investigation. Heatlie was part of 
the investigative team.

When 
asked 
who 
was 

responsible for UVM’s missteps, 
General William Sorrell said, “I’m 
not sure where the buck stops. 
Attorney (Pamela) Heatlie was 
in charge of the investigation … 
Attorney Heatlie could have asked 
to do more.”

She didn’t think much of texting 

Khan for office hours. He had put it 
on the board during discussion for 
everyone to reach out.

When they met up, the second 

student in Hussain’s lecture — also 
an LSA senior — was interested 
in the conversation and saw 
opportunity for academic guidance 
and reference. The conversation 
drifted to her family, in a little 
more than friendly manner. Then 
a blonde woman walked into the 
coffee shop.

“He had said something like, 

‘You know what? Like I’m not 
attracted to blondes,’” she said. 
“And I was like, ‘Why?’ Like it had 
nothing to do with the context 
because I remember being like 
super, super, like, shocked by that. 
And he was like, ‘Yeah, I mean I 
think they all look the same.’”

Khan said he liked brunettes 

better. This LSA senior is a 
brunette.

She said it was hard for her to 

rebuke him: he was a source of 
information for many students and 
offered help on exams. Khan even 
told her he would help her with 
her internship applications. Again, 
office hours turned into personal 
conversation.

“He said that he and Hussain, 

the professor, go way back,” she 
said. “I felt like I couldn’t approach 
the professor at one point because 
if they’re so close, it’d be this 
weird thing for me to be like, ‘Hey, 
your good friend … is doing these 
things and it’s making me feel 
uncomfortable.’”

Studies Program at its peak was 
that it was really intersectional,” 
Villarosa 
explained. 
“When 

I talked to current students 
today about the A/PIA Studies 
Program … so many key folks 
are either being pushed out 
or 
feeling 
unwelcome. 
The 

program kind of seems like a

which is really too bad because 
it is a really critical piece of your

Villarosa remembers similar

when she was a student 10 years 
ago.

Lawsin went up for a standard 

employment review last year. All 
lecturers undergo what they call 
“major reviews” every few years, 
but after 18 years of teaching at 
the University, Lawsin faced 
a “presumption of renewal” — 
her reviewers were supposedly 
coming into this process with 
the assumption her contract 
would be renewed.

“I 
received 
(the 
report) 

in 
November, 
right 
after 

Thanksgiving, and you read 
the report and it’s actually 
going pretty good — really good 
teaching observations, effective 
teacher, a really good evaluation 
score,” Lawsin said.

But as she read on, Lawsin 

realized 
both 
departments 

had decided not to renew 
her contract. Though she did 
not wish to disclose to The 
Daily specific reasons cited 
by the departments for her 
non-renewal, Lawsin felt the 
reasons, combined with the 
breach in procedure by denying 
her a presumption of renewal, 
gave her a strong enough case 
to submit a rebuttal letter to the 
LSA Executive Committee.

As a member of the Lecturers’ 

Employee Organization, Lawsin 
is supported throughout the 
review 
process 
by 
Kirsten 

Herold, vice president of LEO 
and Lawsin’s appointed union 
representative. Herold was just 
as shocked by the outcome of the 
review as Lawsin.

“The University has the right 

to academic judgement when 
it comes to lecturers,” Herold 
said. “They have the right to 
decide who is or isn’t good. But 
they don’t have the right to be 
arbitrary ... In a general way, 
we’ll argue that the judgement 
that was exercised was arbitrary. 
They found things they didn’t 
like about her because they 
didn’t like her.”

Both 
departments 
agreed 

to review Lawsin’s case once 

more. In February, they again 
recommended her termination. 
In March, Lawsin found out the 
decision would be upheld by the 
LSA Executive Committee. She 
will continue teaching at the 
University for two “terminal” 
years, at which point she’ll 
undergo 
another 
review. 
If 

her contract is not renewed 
again, she will have to leave the 
University.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald, speaking on behalf of 
LSA administration, declined to 
comment. 

Lawsin 
said 
she 
sees 

the 
failed 
review 
as 
a 

consequence for speaking out 
about the mistreatment and 
discrimination she’s felt at the 
University over the last 18 years. 
She said she doesn’t know how 
likely it is she’ll be able to stay 
on with the University when her 
next review comes in two years.

“I’ve never really met anyone 

who’s in this position,” Lawsin 
said. “It’s very unique. I have a 
lawsuit against the University. 
It’s clear that this is an act of 
retaliation.”

Lawsin filed the lawsuit in 

question 
jointly 
with 
her 

husband Scott Kurashige, a 
former 
University 
professor 

and Asian American Studies 
scholar. Kurashige served as the 
director of the A/PIA Studies 
Program beginning in 2010, 
until he was abruptly removed 
from 
the 
position 
without 

warning before his term had 
finished. In 2016, Lawsin and 
Kurashige filed a legal complaint 
against the University under 
the 
Michigan 
Elliott-Larsen 

Civil Rights Act, making claims 
of racial discrimination and 
harassment.

The Elliott-Larsen Act, passed 

in 1976, prohibits discrimination 
based on “religion, race, color, 
national origin, age, sex, height, 
weight, 
familial 
status, 
or 

marital status,” in employment 
and education, among other 
areas.

Kurashige and Lawsin are 

represented by civil rights lawyer 
Alice Jennings. In an interview 
with The Daily, Jennings said 
this case is unique because the 
University has prided itself on 
prioritizing diversity and equity, 
especially in recent years.

“Despite what some people 

automatically think about U-M 
as a wonderful place, there are 
people who know … It’s not like 
that all the time,” Jennings said. 
“Or even sometimes, depending 
on who you are.” 

Though Fitzgerald declined 

comment for this article, he told 
The Daily in March 2017 the 
University would not acquiesce 
to the charges.

“We will vigorously defend 

the 
University 
against 
this 

lawsuit,” Fitzgerald wrote in an 
email to The Daily. “In fact, the 
University already has filed a 
motion to dismiss much of the 
complaint.”

The 2016 lawsuit cites a 

whole slew of situations Lawsin 
and Kurashige went through 
at the University, including 
pay disputes, conflicts with 
administrators, 
mishandling 

of their requests from the 
Office of Institutional Equity 
and others. The majority of the 
issues described in the lawsuit 
stem from what they feel is an 
inhospitable environment at the 
University for faculty of color 
who speak out about injustice.

“I 
think 
the 
pattern 
of 

discrimination and filing things 
on faculty of color or students of 
color who speak up is a growing 
problem that stretches back 
years and years,” Lawsin said. 
“But the University would like 
to cover that up.”

***
Lawsin, a spoken-word artist 

and scholar with a master’s 
degree from the University of 
California, Los Angeles, began 
teaching as a lecturer at the 
University in 2000. She was 
referred to as a “spousal hire” by 
the University — a term alleging 
she owed her employment to her 
marital status and her husband’s 
accomplishments, rather than 
her own.

Lawsin isn’t the first faculty 

member to feel undertones of 
discrimination in the American 
Culture 
Department. 
Sarita 

See, a good friend of Lawsin’s, 
joined the faculty as a tenure-
track assistant professor in 2002 
with a joint appointment in the 
American Culture Department 
and English Department. At 
first, she said, the job was like a 
dream come true.

“I felt like my scholarship 

was really being challenged 
in 
exciting 
ways, 
because 

there were so many assistant 
professors of color pursuing 
scholarship,” See said. “All of 
that changed in about five years, 
when you started to see these 
colleagues of mine, who became 
very close friends, start to go 
up for tenure and start to get 
denied, and lecturers would get 
fired.” 

See soon went up for tenure 

herself. After obtaining tenure 
in 
American 
Culture 
and 

being denied it in English, she 
appealed the decision, which 
meant her case would go to 
the LSA administration for 
higher review. LSA overruled 
the decision of the English 
department, and eventually See 
received the distinction in both 
of her departments.

portal and ship the required texts 
either to their home or to the two 
Barnes & Noble bookstore locations 
on campus — the current store in 
Pierpont Commons and the new 
store in the Michigan Union after 
the renovations are completed in 
winter term 2020.

Students 
can 
receive 
free 

shipping if books are shipped to 
the brick-and-mortar Barnes & 
Noble locations on campus, and if 
students complete returns through 
the physical stores, students will 
not be charged for shipping the 
books back from the store.

Susan Pile, senior director of 

University Unions and Auxiliary 
Services, 
commented 
on 
the 

process of establishing the new 
program with Barnes & Noble, 
noting many factors such as student 

and faculty input and affordability 
concerns went into developing the 
program.

“We were hearing from CSG 

and other students whose concerns 
about textbook affordability,” Pile 
said. “We were also nearing the end 
of our contract with Barnes & Noble 
with the closure of the Michigan 
Union and I think we started to 
hear from some faculty that the 
current system for them to select 
options and make their course 
material selections and for students 
to get the books in their hands was 
also hearing some challenges so 
I think sort of three things came 
together at once.”

LSA sophomore Zainab Imami 

said she has had issues with 
expensive 
textbook 
purchases 

at 
on-campus 
bookstores 
and 

experienced difficulty finding the 
correct edition of a textbook online.

“Usually 
using 
the 
regular 

campus bookstores, the textbooks 

are really expensive especially 
compared to renting them or 
getting them off Amazon,” Imami 
said. “But then with renting 
them, you have to send them back 
eventually also and then when you 
can’t find a book or the new edition, 
that’s also frustrating.”

However, the new shipping 

program means textbooks will not 
be housed in the Barnes & Noble 
locations, but rather everything will 
be ordered and paid for through the 
portal and shipped to the desired 
location. 
Associate 
University 

Registrar Kortney Briske played 
a hand in the decision to partner 
with Barnes & Noble, considering 
the technological implications of a 
fully online system.

Briske said the ability for 

professors to weigh their textbook 
options and merge their Wolverine 
Access pages with the Barnes & 
Noble website will be beneficial for 
both students and faculty.

“This system actually gives 

the faculty member options and 
it will display prices and different 
versions of the books,” Briske said. 
“If the faculty (member) has a 
specific textbook in mind and it’s 
very expensive, they can see that 
price and they might (think) ‘Gosh, 
that’s a lot of money’ and the system 
will display other similar textbooks 
that might be cheaper that would 
then give the faculty member to 
choose something different.”

Given 
the 
second 
Union 

storefront won’t be open until the 
Union renovations are complete, 
Pile said her office is looking into 
establishing a temporary Central 
Campus location for next fall to 
house the shipment facility. She also 
addressed the potential lines with 
students ordering their textbooks 
the first week or two on campus, 
claiming 
the 
online 
payment 

system should shorten delays.

“I feel confident in (Barnes 

and Noble’s) ability to meet those 
needs and do that in an expeditious 
manner and I think the student 
experience when they actually 
come in on-site to pick up, it’s 
really a matter of seconds for 
that transaction,” Pile said. “It’s 
really verifying who you are and 
then retrieving the box of books 
that you’ve ordered … It should 
go actually pretty quickly for 
students.”

According 
to 
the 
program 

description, condition options will 
be provided so students can choose 
whether they want to buy as new, 
used, rental, or digital download 
packages. An additional up-front 
“buy-back” price allows students 
to plan on how much they will 
receive if they want to sell their 
books back to Barnes & Noble 
after the semester, in an effort to 
help students structure finances 
and seek out the best deal on a 
consistently large expense.

Imami said this function of the 

partnership makes the system 
much more appealing for students 
who 
are 
looking 
to 
improve 

textbook affordability.

“If I have the option to look and 

compare (prices) and then it gets 
shipped to Barnes & Noble and I can 
go pick it up, that would be great. It 
makes a lot of things easier,” Imami 
said.

Pile said this system matches 

up with current student buying 
practices 
— 
looking 
online 

and hunting for the best deal. 
While a concern about what this 
partnership will mean for current 
competitor stores like Ulrich’s, 
which 
still 
houses 
textbooks 

in-store, is present, Pile explained 
students still have the option to 
shop where they please.

A

h, summertime. A time 
for many students at the 
University of Michigan 
to head off to big corporations 
to get the opportunity to earn a 
meaningful wage and network 
— an opportunity that can open 
doors for years to come. These 
individuals 
have 
positioned 
themselves for success now and 
in the future. These internships 
should obviously be celebrated, 
but what about those who don’t 
have corporate aspirations? What 
about the students who have to 
take an unpaid internship with a 
political candidate?
I come from a pretty low 
socioeconomic background, and 
I have perceived how tone-deaf 
many student organizations are 
when it comes to money. This is 
unsurprising when we consider 
that the median family income 
here is $154,000 a year. And while 
I have met a number of people who 
are supportive and wonderful, 
I’ve met just as many or more who 
don’t know or don’t care about the 
struggles of low-income students 
at the University.
What’s 
more 
surprising, 
however, are the politicians who 
offer “summer internships” for 
students who are developing or 
already have a deep passion for 
social and political change. These 
interns could be the next senator, 
representative 
or 
simply 
an 
activist for a particular issue they 
care about. And yet, getting into 
positions like these requires a lot 
of funding and experience.
I’ll say this right now: If you 
have a genuine passion for a 
candidate, it is reasonably easy 
to get an internship with a 
campaign. But I want to take a 
moment to help us sift through 
the B.S. to understand what an 
“intern” is, and what a political 
internship actually does. All of 
the rules and regulations can be 

found on the compliance page 
for internships, but the glaring 
issue with the internships that 
get handed to students is that they 
are essentially the same jobs that 
are held by many field employees 
— individuals who are paid to do 
work interns are doing.
If an intern’s work is what a 
paid employee could be doing, the 
intern should then be considered 
an employee, and this is probably 
the most egregious part of the 
entire process. Despite the fact 
that many individuals do the 
same work as the field organizers 
in terms of canvassing or posting 
on social media, I’ve seen so 
many 
students 
get 
wrapped 
into campaigns where they feel 
like they have to put it before a 
job or their coursework so they 
can get ahead. Maybe there are 
individuals who feel comfortable 
putting their unpaid internship 
before school, but not everyone 
can afford to do so. If an intern 
is taking the place of what a paid 
employee can be doing, they are 
entitled to the minimum wage and 
overtime wages.
Now, I understand that these 
criticisms can be — perhaps 
unfairly — levied on the candidates 
who already support improving 
labor practices. The argument 
might be made that political 
internships are a practical step 
in getting these labor policies in 
place. But if for whatever reason, 
a candidate has to step on and 
marginalize a group that already 
has the potential to be exploited 
— low socioeconomic status 
folks — they should not be the 
ones in office.
At a staff-wide meeting of 
an internship with a political 
candidate that I worked with, 
we were told that if we didn’t go 
through a “40-hour week,” we 
should get out of the campaign, 
for it would jeopardize our 

letter of recommendation. They 
verbatim asked us to skip classes 
during get-out-the-vote drives if 
it interfered with our class times. 
These 
perhaps 
well-meaning 
employees understandably have 
one goal in mind, but this goal 
shouldn’t replace the importance 
of taking care of the people who 
are supporting the campaign. 
That includes the interns.
As radical as it may sound — 
side note, it isn’t — I’m merely 
asking for politicians to pay 
the 
individuals 
and 
students 
who want to get involved in the 
political experience. I understand 
that not every volunteer can be 
paid, and many times getting 
paid 
internships 
involves 
getting experience beforehand. 
Individuals who volunteer for a 
political campaign can choose to 
dedicate their time working in jobs 
that are less time-intensive, such 
as phone banking. And I can really 
see where, if politicians can pay 
their interns, programs like the 
LSA Internship Scholarship can 
help supplement the costs of living 
on campus during the summer to 
get these opportunities.
Of 
course, 
a 
scholarship 
certainly 
won’t 
excuse 
the 
rhetoric about improving labor 
relations while ignoring your 
own, for all intents and purposes, 
employee. This won’t hurt the 
politicians who don’t care about 
their employees and are only 
trying to support corporations 
and businesses. What I do know, 
however, is that if politicians 
don’t change the status quo, we’ll 
be stuck in the same idea that 
has been implied for the past 200 
years — people are expendable 
and a means to an end. Politicians 
should be better than that.

Politicians, pay your interns

To 
remedy 
this 
gap 
in 
resources, the University must 
increase funding for Counseling 
and Psychological Services and 
advertise services provided by 
Addiction Treatment Services 
through 
Michigan 
Medicine. 
Over 90 percent of students who 
use Adderall use it for the purpose 
of concentrating while studying. 
These students do not realize 
the potential negative effects of 
the drug: notably, its high risk 
of dependency and potentially 
lethal 
consequences 
if 
used 
with other drugs and alcohol. 
With such a large percentage of 
students using Adderall without 
a prescription, it is important 
that the University provides 
students with addiction help.
Increasing 
resources 
on 
campus is another step the 
University needs to take to 
educate its students. Through 
CAPS, 
students 
can 
take 
advantage 
of 
a 
variety 
of 
treatment services, including 
two 
45-minute 
confidential 
sessions 
of 
Assessment 
of 
Substance 
Abuse 
Patterns, 
individual and group counseling 
and referral services. These 
services could potentially help 
many students, but we have 
been unable to find clear guides 
from typical campus health 
resources outlining where these 
treatments can be obtained.
The presence of Adderall 
at the University is almost 
expected. Whether prescribed 
or non-prescribed, Adderall is 
a normalized part of campus 
culture; people try it, use it and 
depend on it. Though freshmen 
entrance programs like Haven 
or AlcoholEdu exist to raise 
awareness 
on 
the 
dangers 
of alcohol consumption and 
addiction, there is no campus-
wide campaign that addresses 
the overwhelming prevalence 
of Adderall at the University. 
Consequently, 
most 
students 
don’t know much about the 
drug, 
and 
view 
it 
through 
a 
destigmatized, 
distorted 
lens. Because it is considered 
customary and is easy to acquire, 
most 
students 
don’t 
realize 
the medical, legal and moral 
implications of taking or selling 
the drug.
Adderall is classified as a 
Schedule II drug by the Drug 
Enforcement 
Administration, 
which means that it maintains 
a “high potential for abuse, 
with use potentially leading to 
severe psychological or physical 
dependence.” It ranks higher 
than drugs like Xanax, which is 
Schedule IV, and is at an equal 
level 
with 
cocaine, 
another 
Schedule II drug. In addition 
to its addiction level, Adderall 
can spur painful side effects, 
from insomnia to paranoia. In 
an interview with the Daily, 
one student reported that “if 

I took it at any acute dose, it 
would just kind of cause chest 
discomfort and keep me from 
sleeping, and I couldn’t get 
anything done because the chest 
pain would make me panic.” 
Aside from short-term side 
effects, Adderall can also lead 
to long-term issues and even 
death. An article in the New 
York Times described a college 
student’s fall into depression, 
anxiety and eventual suicide 
due to his extreme addiction to 
Adderall. Despite all this, most 
students on our campus don’t 
view the drug as one that can 
kill because they aren’t aware 
of its high addictivity and the 
health concerns surrounding it, 
especially those students who use 
it sporadically and recreationally. 
Along 
with 
medical 
issues, Adderall dealing and 
use can lead to harsh legal 
consequences. 
The 
length 
and weight of penalties vary, 
but 
according 
to 
Michigan 
law, distribution of Adderall 
illegally is considered a felony 
and can lead to serious jail time. 
Despite this, Adderall dealing 
doesn’t have the same image 
as other drug trafficking. On 
campus, it’s as easy as texting 
someone in your hall for a pill 
or two. There are no back-alley 
deals, and oftentimes, money 
isn’t even involved. Because 
it is destigmatized and bred 
from an intense, competitive 
school culture, giving someone 
Adderall may appear to be 
helpful, not harmful. To some, 
the need to succeed outweighs 
the legal risks. Another student 
interviewed 
by 
The 
Daily 
reflected 
on 
her 
Adderall 
use by saying “I never really 
thought about it as being illegal 
to be honest … I feel like a lot 
of people who don’t have ADD 
(Attention-deficit 
disorder) 
are prescribed Adderall and 
I don’t think it’s like taking a 
Prozac or something that is 
so mentally altering … I don’t 
think of it as, ‘Oh, this is like 
a drug.’” Many students at the 
University echo this mentality 
subliminally, and by forgetting 
the legal implications of selling 
Adderall, we only add to its 
normalization on campus.
The perception of Adderall 
tends to lack the severity 
that 
we 
ascribe 
to 
other 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
Adderall has proven to improve 
students’ performance in rote 
memory 
forms 
of 
learning 
tasks, especially over several 
days or longer, acting as a 
performance 
enhancer 
for 
exams and tests that require 
intensive memorization. This 
can be especially impactful in 
classes in which performance 
relies on rote learning. When 
the difference in letter grade 
is significantly changed by 

the number of concentrated 
hours one’s mind can dedicate 
to memorizing in relation to 
others in their class, Adderall 
acts as a medically induced 
upper hand. While this may not 
be a compelling point to those 
currently using Adderall to 
improve their test performance, 
it should garner the attention 
of students who are forced 
to compete with those who 
use Adderall. The culture of 
nonchalance on the usage of 
study drugs can be altered as 
more people understand and 
recognize the negative ways 
their peers’ usage of Adderall 
affects them.
The 
destigmatizing 
of 
Adderall use at the University 
has blindsided many of these 
moral implications. In fact, 
the possible benefits conferred 
on students who choose to use 
Adderall are equal to the leg-
up athletes gain when using 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
The significant athletic strides 
made possible with the use of 
PEDs has led to their outright 
ban in America by all four 
major American sports leagues, 
the 
National 
Collegiate 
Athletic Association and the 
U.S. Olympic team.
Whether 
they 
improve 
muscle regeneration, increase 
strength or replicate natural 
hormones, PEDs have been 
targeted for elimination by 
sports leagues for some time 
now, as their use is antithetical 
to the idea of a level playing 
field. 
Competition, 
whether 
in sports or academics, should 
remain driven by natural ability 
and effort alone. Adderall’s role 
in the competition for academic 
success should not be trivialized 
but should be paralleled to the 
role of doping and steroids in 
the scandals surrounding once-
hero athletes such as cyclist 
Lance Armstrong and baseball 
player Roger Clemens. 
The 
widespread 
and 
academically motivated use of 
Adderall on campus can make it 
easy to forget what exactly it is: 
a drug. Much like other drugs 
aimed at enhancing abilities, 
whether mental or physical, 
Adderall presents its users 
with a moral choice. Adderall’s 
aid of certain academic abilities 
is one of its innate qualities, 
and students at the University 
should 
recognize 
as 
much. 
For those who view this issue 
as inconsequential, this much 
should 
be 
remembered: 
All 
students, Adderall users or not, 
play on the same academic field. 
 
Thus, we all feel the tilt brought 
about by Adderall, whether it 
pushes us up or down.
Though 
Adderall 
is 
commonly used in academic 
settings, it is also prevalent 
in the college party scene as

FROM THE DAILY

Let’s talk about Adderall

T

he University of Michigan has an Adderall problem. Some would 
even call it an epidemic. Despite the University’s increased 
campaign to recognize mental health on campus, it has failed to 
address how campus culture fosters the use of Adderall throughout the 
school. As students become more entrenched in the popular “work hard, 
play hard” mentality that grips much of the student body, they turn to 
Adderall to achieve the academic and social success that this campus covets. 
A recent survey by The Daily found that 24 percent of University students use 
Adderall, and a 2008 study of 1,800 students found that as much as 81 percent 
of college students think that Adderall usage is not dangerous at all or only 
slightly dangerous, despite the fact that the consequences of the illicit use 
of the drug sit right next to those of cocaine, meth and morphine. However, 
despite the prevalence of the drug, there is a dearth of University resources to 
educate or help students that are grappling with its repercussions.

a complement to alcohol. The 
focus of the University’s efforts 
to curtail dangerous behavior 
has been mostly targeted toward 
alcohol. However, the recent 
increase of mixing the “study 
drug” 
with 
alcohol 
should 
provoke concern because of the 
possibility of dangerous and 
unpredictable effects.
First of all, the University 
should take care to educate 
students 
on 
the 
chemical 
differences between Adderall 
and alcohol. Adderall, on the 
one hand, is a powerful central 
nervous system stimulant that 
increases 
the 
availability 
of 
excitatory 
neurotransmitters 
in areas of the brain that 
deal with focus, energy and 
alertness. On the other hand, 
alcohol is a central nervous 
system depressant that inhibits 
the 
function 
of 
excitatory 
neurotransmitters. 
Alcohol’s 
status as a depressant reduces 
the effect of medical stimulants 
such as Adderall, which leads 
to 
the 
perception 
that 
the 
effects of both drugs are not as 
pronounced as they would be if 
taken individually.
The physiological effects of 

mixing alcohol and Adderall lead 
people to believe Adderall simply 
dulls the effects of alcohol. The 
reality, however, is that even 
though the effect of the stimulant 
is altered, the actual content of 
the drug has not changed at all. 
This sensation of numbness to 
the effects of both stimuli can 
give people the impression that 
they can party longer, making it 
easier for them to overdose.
The mixing of Adderall and 
alcohol then has two discernible 
effects: 
those 
in 
the 
short 
term and in the long term. The 
short-term effects stem from 
the 
unpredictable 
nature 
of 
their combination. One minute 
someone could be within their 
limit of alcohol intake, and the 
next they could be suffering 
from seizures or heart failure as 
a result of the capricious cocktail 
of medication plus alcohol. In 
the long term, a person’s quality 
of life can suffer from mixed 
use. A recent study found 
that simultaneous use of non-
medical prescription stimulants 
and alcohol by undergraduates 
was associated with low grade 
point averages, use of other 
substances 
and 
increased 

alcohol-related consequences.
The group at the highest risk 
for Adderall abuse is college 
students, 
and 
therefore 
the 
University has an obligation to 
educate its student population 
on 
the 
consequences. 
The 
consumption of Adderall is not 
only widespread, but students 
have also become desensitized 
to its possible severity. To 
counteract this trend, a possible 
addition 
to 
the 
AlcoholEdu 
program of a freshman seminar 
on the use of unprescribed 
medication in academic and 
recreational settings could be a 
positive step forward for student 
safety and security.
Make 
no 
mistake, 
the 
nonprescription use of Adderall, 
Ritalin 
and 
similar 
central 
nervous 
system 
stimulants 
is a significant issue on our 
campus. This habit is unhealthy 
and 
academically 
dishonest, 
and we are calling for the 
re-sensitization of this issue. 
There needs to be a sustained, 
robust 
conversation 
about 
stimulant use on campus and 
an investment in a public health 
education 
campaign 
on 
the 
effects of these drugs.

It has been just four days 

since my encounter with Emily 
Blumenthal, and I’ve already 
ordered new business cards.

“You should always have a 

business card, regardless,” she 
advised me from our table in 
Espresso Royale last Friday. A 
gold nameplate necklace reading 
“Handbag 
Designer” 
dangled 

from her neck. “No matter what.”

That’s just a mere glimpse into 

the tenacity and altruism that 
comprise Blumenthal’s character. 
Perhaps better known by her alter 
ego (and book title), Handbag 
Designer 
101, 
the 
University 

alum is the founder of New York 
City’s 
Independent 
Handbag 

Designer Awards, a one-of-a-
kind event dedicated to providing 
opportunities 
to 
upcoming 

handbag designers from around 
the globe.

“I had my handbag line, I had a 

licensing deal that was going south, 
but I had written a template for the 
book, ‘Handbag Designer 101,’ and 
I said to my agent: ‘When’s this 
book deal gonna happen?’” she 
said of the IHDA’s origins. “She 
said: ‘You don’t get a book deal just 
because you started a template 
for a book,’ and I said: ‘But I have 
all this time!’ So I said: OK, what 
about an awards show for handbag 
designers? Because people have 
tried to put handbags in a bucket 
of accessories, and anybody who 
knows anything about fashion or 
even retail, knows handbags are 
very much their own category ... 
I went around to the people who 
I had worked with in the past and 
started saying: ‘Would you be a 
part of this? We’d create a category 
around a specific qualification 
within handbags.’ And everyone 
said yes. It was funny.”

In conversation, Blumenthal 

referred to herself as “garmento 
offspring,” meaning her family 
hails from the garment center. 
According to her, growing up 
in that environment shaped her 
future in fashion.

“It’s funny because I don’t 

think, necessarily, when you fall 
into something, it may not actually 
be your passion, but it seems to be 
your path,” she said. “I think once 
you fall upon that path you realize: 
‘I think this is what I’m supposed 

to be doing because this might 
be what I’m good at.’ Now, are 
handbags, per say, what I’m good 
at? No. I wouldn’t say so. I never 
had formal training, but I can 
look at a handbag, I can identify 
its strengths, its weaknesses, I 
can see why it worked, why it 
won’t work, and then from there, 
after time, you really learn how 
to reverse engineer a process to 
see where the success will lie in 
the item itself. And I think that, 
and then in terms of teaching, 
entrepreneurship, 
that 
has 

become my passion.”

Blumenthal made it clear that 

the IHDA is grounded in high 
moral standards. It is not her 
intent to swindle young designers 
out of what little they have. She 
explained: “I, myself, was an 
independent designer for seven 
years, and after that is when I 
started the Awards. I had applied 
to different competitions, any 
way to get known, and it always 
bothered me that you had to pay 
to apply because I thought, first 
of all, then the authenticity comes 
up to be challenged. And then it 
comes down to, do I really have 
an opportunity to be discovered? 
There’s no pay for play. If we’re 
able to have someone be able 
to create a livelihood or have a 
passion or create a reason to be 
happy about this, and to do it 
smart so they feel that they have 
no regrets, then that’s a complete 
(return on investment) for us.”

Outside 
of 
her 
handbag-

oriented work, Blumenthal has 
an extensive teacher’s résumé. 
She has taught at the Laboratory 
Institute 
of 
Merchandising, 

Parsons School of Design and the 
Fashion Institute of Technology, 
where she currently leads a class 
on entrepreneurship.

“Teaching, to me, considering 

how much I do already, is a lot like 
working out,” she said.

“You never really like it, 

much like as a student you don’t 
really feel like going. You know, 
whatever homework I give, I have 
to grade. But then at the end of 
class you feel so good that you’ve 
been able to have a dialogue with 
other people and really, at the end 
of the day, have an impact to try 
and, in my personal case, make 
sure if anybody is going to start 
a brand or business, that they 
have the opportunity to do it in 

a smart way. You have to look at 
everything you do in terms of 
giving back, even on a small scale, 
so if you’ve helped one student be 
able to look at things in a more 
analytical and strategic sense, 
then it was absolutely worth it. It’s 
totally a workout,” she laughed.

New York fashion schools are 

all well and good, but how can 
University students, who don’t 
have the luxury of attending class 
in America’s fashion mecca, break 
into the industry?

“Reach out to Michigan alum, 

first and foremost, and keep 
your communication as short as 
possible,” 
Blumenthal 
offered. 

“And do your homework. And 
whatever 
communication 
you 

have, don’t make it about yourself. 
Make it about what you can 
contribute.”

With a sly smile, she added: 

“Keep to yourself that you went to 
the best school that ever existed.”

Now would be a good time to 

mention that Blumenthal was 
once a staff member at The Daily, 
working within the advertising 
department. When I asked about 
her tenure, her eyes lit up.

“Working at The Daily was 

kind of the entire framework 
of my career,” she said. “I think 
learning to go door to door at such 
a young age and having to manage 
people’s businesses, and that 
people’s sales were tied to an ad 
that I was responsible for selling 
to them, I think that taught me 
early on that this is business, this 
is what it’s about. And it showed 
me I was good at it. I think you’re 
always trying to find something 
that you’re good at, and I realized, 
I can sell. There was something 
about working there that made 
you feel adult. And it made you feel 
grown up, and it made you feel like 
you were empowered and that you 
could make a difference, that you 
could really do something and that 
you had value. It was the first real 
validating experience I had as an 
adult, and for that I am eternally 
grateful.”

I am grateful to you, Emily, 

for being the reason I finally got 
off my butt and ordered those 
business cards.

Last Jan. on a crisp, Mich. 

winter evening, I arrived at El Club 
in Southwest Detroit to find a line 
outside, stretching around the 
corner. Isaiah Rashad — the B-list 
hip-hop star who the crowd had 
come out for — wasn’t scheduled 
to perform for another three hours. 
Yet hundreds of fans were already 
lingering at the club’s entrance, 
eager to be among the first inside. 
Despite having never been to the 
venue before, I rushed to its doors 
wearing a costume of confidence 
and tried to imply that waiting 
would, for me, be unacceptable. 
Despite having never attended a 
concert as a member of the press 
before, I announced myself to the 
bouncers through my best veteran 
impression and tried to imply that I 
was actually somebody.

“Salvatore DiGioia. Michigan 

Daily. Press list.”

As a music journalist, the 

first time you enter a concert 
without paying admission is a 
benchmark moment. It catalyzes 
your 
metamorphosis 
into 
a 

legitimate 
professional 
and 

validates your participation in 
the culture. I arrived at El Club 
last Jan. as a well-experienced 
consumer, having spent more 
than a decade purchasing my 
way into rap concerts. However, 
after being approved by bouncers 
and subsequently strutting into 
the venue, I felt myself cross 
an industry threshold. It had 
long been a dream of mine to be 
expected at such a function — for 
a rapper or publicist to be aware 
of my presence. So, when Isaiah 
Rashad thanked me for coming, 
shook my hand and said, honestly, 
“I hope you enjoy the show,” it 
instantly seemed to validate the 
countless hours I’d spent honing 
my craft.

My love for reading developed 

like that of most of my peers — 
through the adventures of fictional 
heroes like Harry Potter and 
Captain Underpants. Yet I quickly 
transitioned my attention from 
bookshelves to the internet, an 
editorial landscape with fewer 
boundaries and more dimensions. 
Having inherited an obsession 
with hip hop from older siblings, I 
relied on the lifestyle to help shape 
my online experience, seeking 
out fan forums and niche news 
sources. I spent much of my middle 

school years worshipping lifestyle 
mags Hypebeast and Complex 
as cultural canon or skimming 
through Rolling Stone’s “Best Of” 
lists for extra context. Eventually, 
I decided I wanted to write 
about music myself. A handful of 
decisions later, I arrived at The 
Daily.

In autumn of my sophomore 

year, I was denied a place on The 
Daily Arts section and encouraged 
to re-apply in the future. It was 
a humbling setback, particularly 
since my application was the 
first piece of music writing that 
I’d ever shared. Yet it sparked a 
competitive streak within me 
that soon led to a major growth 
spurt. In wake of my denial, I 
became jealous of The Daily’s 
fully-operative 
infrastructure 

and semi-professional status. I 
longed to prove myself as equally 
committed to the craft as their 
staff, to have a reason to care 
about music as much as I did. So, I 
enrolled in essay-writing courses 
and published work in Consider; 
I subscribed to The New Yorker 
and started reading multiple arts 
publications daily; I identified my 
favorite critics and began following 
their careers intently. Inspired by a 
door in the face from The Daily, I 
set out to learn how to think, listen 
and write like a music critic. One 
year later, I was accepted as an Arts 
writer.

The first article I published in 

The Daily was a review of Kanye 
West’s Saint Pablo Tour. My 
admission to the show was not 
free and my recap of it had not 
been organized by a publicist, but 
I was excited to see the story in 
print nonetheless. Some relatives 
even requested copies via mail. 
On the morning of the story’s 
release, I rose early and rushed 
straight to the business school, 
eager to grab a handful of papers 
and post a Snapchat. There’s a 
numbing ecstasy that comes with 
the publishing of a new article 
and for your first, it is utterly 
overwhelming. It doesn’t matter if 
anyone even reads the damn thing. 
For writers, the act of contributing 
to the rhetoric is fulfilling in itself.

After 
meeting 
Isaiah 

Rashad, things changed for me 
professionally. At the disposal of my 
editors, I became The Daily’s go-to 
designation for Detroit’s hip-hop 
scene and went on to cover concerts 
by DRAM, A$AP Rocky and more. 
At the disposal of Def Jam Records, 
I attended the world premiere of 

Big Sean’s fourth album, I Decided., 
and reviewed the LP before most 
national publications. Shortly after, 
I had opportunities to interview 
Lil Yachty and A Boogie Wit Da 
Hoodie. 
Finally, 
having 
fully 

realized the weight of The Daily’s 
prestige, I upped my bets to earn 
press access for shows in Paris 
and Los Angeles. The old saying 
is “Wherever you go, ‘Go Blue!’” 
Wherever I went, I wrote for The 
Daily.

In two weeks, I will graduate 

from college and depart from 
Ann Arbor. I won’t ever again 
introduce myself as: “Salvatore 
DiGioia. Michigan Daily. Press 
list.” In fact, I may never again 
direct any bouncer to any “press 
list” whatsoever. Instead, I expect 
to spend the upcoming festival 
season, once again, as a consumer, 
diminished into buying my way 
into excited scenes. Come the 
fall, when summer’s buzziest acts 
inevitably set out on theater tours, 
I don’t expect to be offered free 
admission. I still plan to obsess 
over hip hop and attend concerts 
routinely, but long gone are my 
days of being expected at such 
functions.

For a while, thanks to The Daily, 

I had just big enough of a platform to 
convince myself that I was actually 
somebody. I analyzed art under 
the presumption that someone 
cared I was doing so and, on a few 
occasions, directly conversed with 
my favorite musicians. Lil Yachty 
sang along to Playboi Carti’s “Let 
It Go” with me; A Boogie laughed 
at my name. I will always long 
to stand in those rooms, write 
those stories and be that guy. (In 
fact, if anyone from Rolling Stone 
or Pitchfork is reading, track 
me down!). However, upon my 
graduation from The Daily, such 
work will once again be a just 
hobby, such access to talent but a 
dream. At least for now.

Like an athlete who’s graduating 

without obvious draft potential, I 
am hyper-aware that this could be 
the last team I ever play for. Should 
it be, I would not have wanted to 
learn how to think, listen and write 
like a music critic from any other 
teammates.

“Wyatt Cenac’s 
Problem Areas”

Series Premiere

HBO

Fridays @ 11:30 p.m.

In the era of Trump, late night 

TV has become saturated with 
talking heads putting out segments 
and quick, worn-out jokes about the 
most talked-about man in America, 
but comedian Wyatt Cenac (“People 
of Earth”) is here to change that.

A three-time Emmy winner and 

former correspondent and writer 
for “The Daily Show,” Cenac is 
no stranger to the art of satirical 
television. 
Generally 
a 
writer 

hidden behind the scenes, Cenac’s 
new HBO docu-series “Problem 
Areas” puts him right in front of 
the camera. But “Problem Areas” 
isn’t another “Daily Show” or 
“Colbert Report.” From the first 

episode alone, the show develops a 
clear personality of its own. There 
are some obvious departures from 
classic late night TV — Cenac does 
not sit behind a desk to deliver 
his lines, but rather walks around 
on a set, which looks like a cross 
between a mature version of “Blue’s 
Clues” and a ’70s community 
center. There’s no studio audience 
either, leaving the focus on Cenac 
and not the laughs or applause he 
might draw. Yet the most pointed 
change from late night isn’t the lack 
of a desk or an audience, but rather 
the omission of late night’s favorite 
topic: Trump.

Cenac 
promised 
that 
his 

10-episode series would be pretty 
much 
Trump-free, 
and 
focus 

instead on the stories that get lost 
in the shadow of the president. 

After his opening dialogue on the 
problem with billionaires and space, 
it becomes apparent that “Problem 
Areas” isn’t just another late night 
show hosted by a star trying their 
chance at becoming the next big 
voice in entertainment’s brigade 
against Trump. It is less a comedian 
trying to convince you with their 
side of the argument and more 
your educated, left-leaning friend 
discussing the world’s problems 
with you over coffee.

With 
some 
smaller 
issues 

scattered throughout, Cenac will 
be focusing on one major issue in 
America: policing. A Black man 
arrested at age 19 for inciting a riot is 
an issue not just vital to discuss, but 
pertinent to Cenac’s own life. The 
most impressive part of “Problem 
Areas” is the show’s ability to 

educate without promoting a single 
agenda. After admitting he’s not an 
expert on the topic of policing in 
America, Cenac strolls over to a TV 
where a cast of people — including 
activists, police chiefs and New 
York City mayor Bill De Blasio — 
pop up to discuss the topic in more 
depth.

Towards the end of the episode, 

Cenac ventures into communities 
to talk with the citizens and 
administrators that feel the real-
life fall out from problems with 
policing. He goes to Falcon Heights, 
Minn., a midwestern town that 
made national headlines after the 
brutal killing of Philando Castile 
during a traffic stop. Unlike late 
night hosts who talk about these 

things from the comfort of their 
New York studio, Cenac manages 

to imbue faces and feelings into the 
headlines. He doesn’t try to add a 
contrived comedic twist or give a 
monologue about what this says 
about America. Instead, Cenac tries 
to figure out what it is that got the 
country to this low point, and how it 
could be pulled out of it.

In the excitement of late night’s 

comedic breakdown of Trump, 
other important stories get left 
behind. Comedy has become an 
important medium in educating 
people 
about 
contemporary 

issues in a way that will actually 
make them pay attention and 
understand. Cenac recognizes this, 
but capitalizes on the opportunity 
to shed light on the stories nobody 
else is telling. In doing so, he 
challenges others to reach beyond 
the low-hanging fruit of Trump-
bashing. Cenac doesn’t examine 
the man, but rather the reasons

At a time with such heightened 

political anxiety, when Americans 
wonder what it’s truly like to live 
in 
Putin’s 
mysterious 
Russia, 

“Loveless,” 
nominee 
for 
the 

Academy Award for Best Foreign 
Film, may provide us with some 
answers. Directed by Andrey 
Zvyagintsev, 
the 
celebrated 

director of “The Return” and 
“Leviathan,” the film illustrates a 
world in which the sociopolitical 
state is so bleak that relationships 
and love have a difficult chance at 
survival.

“Loveless” is set in Moscow 

in 
the 
autumn, 
where 

Mikhail 
Krichman’s 
haunting 

cinematography and cool tones 
illustrate a desolate, cold and 
lifeless 
environment 
of 
trees 

without leaves or snow. His 
camera, like a ghost, slowly floats 
over icy rivers and grey forests 
and embodies this dreary mood. 
There is no place for flowers to 
grow and love to bloom. This place 
of lovelessness has no care and 
nothing or anyone to care for. It has 
no tenderness for its citizens.

The characters that exist, barely, 

in this world are Zhenya (Maryana 
Spivak, “Vasiliy Stalin”) and her 
husband Boris (Aleksey Rozin, 
“Leviathan”) who suffer together 
in a miserable marriage. On the 
brink of divorce, Zhenya and Boris 

have already moved on from each 
other, but there was never really 
any love between them. The only 
thread that holds their marriage 
together is Boris’s conservative 
Christian boss who implements a 
company policy where divorce is 
not permitted. Boris impregnates 
a younger girl, while Zhenya starts 
dating a wealthier older man who 
buys her lobster and wine while 
she plays footsies with his crotch 

during dinner.

Zhenya and Boris’s 12-year-old 

son, Alyosha, played by newcomer 
but 
natural 
Matvey 
Novikov, 

overhears one of their fights during 
the middle of the night. Illuminated 
by one of the film’s most painful 
visual shots — a silent howl behind 
Zhenya’s door slam — Alyosha has 
had enough of being unloved. He 
disappears the next day while his 
parents are off sleeping with their 
respective lovers. Of course they 
don’t realize his absence initially 
because they are so entrenched in 
total self-involvement. They are 
unable to see how their actions 
affect 
others, 
including 
their 

child. Zvyagintsev seems to be 
simultaneously critiquing our era’s 
current reliance on selfies and 
social media — means for people 

to be obsessed with themselves 
and be blind to compassion. The 
morning after Zhenya and Boris 
argue, Zhenya is too preoccupied 
with posting pictures and scrolling 
through her feed that she doesn’t 
even notice when Alyosha’s single 
tear dances down his face.

At 
first 
glance, 
“Loveless” 

appears to be a film about a 
tragic marriage that results in a 
runaway child. But it has way more 
complexity than that; by the end 
of the film, you realize it isn’t even 
about Alyosha whatsoever — he is 
secondary to the thesis of the film. 
It is about a voyage of attempting 
to become self-aware by selfish 
people who are wholly engulfed in 
themselves. It is a quest to possess 
empathy.

“Loveless” has layers. Like 

“Leviathan,” 
an 
allegory 
and 

social commentary about the 
plight of ordinary people living 
under 
Russia’s 
bureaucracy 

and 
institutional 
corruption, 

“Loveless” makes subtle critiques 
of the Russian state and how it is 
falling apart. Its arbitrary credence 
in religion, its engagement in 
war, its governmental chaos and 
failure of its police force to look for 
Alyosha. We hear real news clips 
on Boris’s radio in the background 
to remind us of the eerie politics of 
the period.

“Loveless” 
is 
hauntingly 

hypnotic. It makes us look into 
ourselves and question: How can 
life exist without love? “Loveless” 
then answers this question: It can’t.

Jeff Rosenstock on album 
‘POST-’ & upcoming show

ARTIST PROFLIE

Just two weeks ago, The 

Daily was lucky enough to have 
a chance to speak with singer/
songwriter 
Jeff 
Rosenstock 

about 
his 
newest 
record, 

POST-, 
and 
his 
upcoming 

show on Apr. 25, accompanied 
by Martha and Bad Moves, at 
the Loving Touch in Ferndale. 
Now in his mid-30s, a punk 
artist for whom it truly wasn’t 
a phase, the Long Island native 
found his musical roots in 
ska over two decades ago. An 
incredibly prolific artist, he 
has made and released music 
as part of his band Bomb 
the Music Industry!, along 
with several other projects, 
including recently composing 
the music for “Craig of the 
Creek,” a new show on Cartoon 
Network.

The Michigan Daily: What 

does the title of POST- mean 
to you? Then, the cover image 
looks like someone vacuuming 
maybe like an entryway. Where 
did that image come from and 
why did you decide on that?

Rosenstock: It’s hard to get 

into — I’ve been asked this a 
bunch of times and I feel like 
I’ve given a different answer 
every time, so I need to admit 
that the title, I think that what 
really appealed to me about 
it was that it was really … I 
wanted to have something that 
felt open and vague, and that 
felt that way to me. I had that 
written in a notebook and I felt 
like it could mean a handful 
of different things, which I 
think are pretty obvious on the 
record or just like, just livin’ in 
these times, man. But I liked 
that it was really open-ended, 
so I feel like trying to give an 
answer to it makes it not really 
be all the things, you know?

With 
the 
cover 
image, 

specifically, and the title, and 
the color scheme, and all that, 

I was hoping to hit that vibe 
of just waking up after being 
knocked out. Like I tried to 
make the color kind of like 
that color that the morning is 
when the morning first starts 
and maybe you can’t sleep. 
That grayish, bluish just kind 
of feeling.

And 
Hiro 
Tanaka 
is 
a 

photographer 
from 
Japan. 

He’s also a really good buddy, 
really, really cool dude, really 
fun dude to hang out with, and 
he travels with us on tour and 
he took a lot of really awesome 

pictures from the tour we did 
last summer, and that is one 
of a guy vacuuming up at like 
one o’clock in the morning, 
two o’clock in the morning at a 
casino in Reno, Nev. And I just 
kind of, I just thought it just 
suited it. I just kept throwing 
a bunch of stuff in there and 
then it was like, “Oh wait, shit, 
yeah. This is it. Thanks, Hiro.”

TMD: 
You 
strike 
me 

as someone who might be 
frustrated 
with 
people 
in 

music taking themselves too 
seriously. Would you agree 
with that?

Rosenstock: 
Oh 
yeah, 

totally. 
Why 
wouldn’t 
you 

wanna try and be funny? I 
don’t understand why a lot of 
people’s instinct is to ignore 
their senses of humor when it 
comes to anything. I feel like, 
personally, when people have 
a sense of humor about shit, it 
makes their art more relatable 
to me. I’ve been stoked about 
the younger bands that we’ve 
been 
playing 
with, 
’cause 

they all seem to have a little 
bit of a sense of humor about 
themselves, and not afraid to 
show it, and I think that that is 
nice, for me as a fan, you know?

TMD: For sure. One of 

the things that surprised me 
about POST- before I had even 
listened was that it’s just 10 
songs, with “USA” clocking in 
at seven and a half minutes and 
“Let Them Win” at 11. That’s 
compared to WORRY. with 17 
songs, where the back half is 
all these one- to two-minute 
jams that just flow into each 
other. What was the change in 
mindset that accompanied that 
change in structure?

Rosenstock: A few things. 

I’ve been listening to more 
ambient music, which I didn’t 
have too much of a grasp on 
when I was writing WORRY., 
but I’ve been trying to listen 
to things just to feel calmer, 
and I wanted to try and see if 
there was any space for being 
calm in a record of mine, 
because usually there’s not. 
It seemed like a kind of fun 
challenge to take on, and it felt 
like a natural time to give it a 
shot. It didn’t feel like I was 
forcing anything. I was really 
stoked how the end of “Let 
Them Win” turned out. That 
was at the end of a very very 
stressful couple of months. I 
recorded that shit just for the 
demo of the song, just to hear, 
“Will it sound good?” It kind 
of feels like a very emotional 
thing for me. I don’t know, 
whatever, 
who 
cares. 
But 

because I felt like I had a little 
bit of a better grasp on how I 
would want something with 
space to sound, and I think 
that one of the defining factors 
of our current shit as a human 
race is that there is no time to 
process anything. And that the 
fuckin’ record starts off pretty 
harshly, I thought that adding 
some time for reflection would 
be good.

I listened to that record On 

the Beach by Neil Young a ton. 
It’s one of my favorite records. 
I listened to the record Perfect 
From Now On by Built To 
Spill a ton, and both of those 
records are records that have 
a lot of space to them, where 

you can kind of get lost, jump 
in and out and go at your own 
pace and eventually it becomes 
your favorite thing. I don’t 
think I’ve usually made too 
much stuff that was like that, 
so I just wanted to give it a shot 
this time around. And it seems 
really 
smart 
now 
because 

people like it, but when I was 
done with it I was just like, 
“This fuckin’ song just turns 
into a ‘Stranger Things’ space-
jam for four minutes and it’s 
the first song on the record. 
Uh, why would anyone want to 
listen to this?”

TMD: I thought it was kind 

of funny — well, not funny, but 
WORRY. came out and then 
we had the election. Were you 
like, “Crap, now I have to make 
another album?” What was 
your feeling around that time?

Rosenstock: Yeah, I wasn’t 

like, “I gotta make an album, 
save the world!” you know? 
We were on tour, playing in 
Iowa as the dagger was being 
thrown, basically. We went on 
and it was kind of even, and 
then while we were playing I 
was like, “Man, everyone here 
seems to not like our band right 
now.” I looked over at the merch 
and Christine and Morgan and 
Cody who were doing merch 
for us — Katie Ellen and Hard 
Girls, respectively — were 
just shaking their heads back 
and forth. It was like, “What 
did we do wrong? Are we bad 
tonight? Are we worse than 
usual?” And then when we got 
off and I’d seen like, “Oh shit, 
it’s done,” some kid came up to 
me when I was talking to them 
in disbelief and was like, “Hey 
man, it fuckin’ happened.” Just 
basically like, “You can’t think 
that this didn’t just happen. 
This just happened.” I was 
like, “Whoa, stranger, that’s 
some heavy shit.”

I think being on tour for that 

record as that was happening 
affected me in a way I can’t 
really articulate. It gave me a 
lot of hope, to be honest with 
you. Because as these things 
were going bad around us, 
Anika and Cody — from Katie 
Ellen — had come up with the 
idea to, well, we were playing a 
college show the next day, and 
we wanted to take donations 
at 
the 
door 
for 
Planned 

Parenthood, like right away. 
And they were like, “You can’t 
do that, because it’s a state 
building.” So instead, Katie 
Ellen — the band — came up 
with the idea of having a make-
your-own-protest-pin station, 
so you could write, like, “Fuck 
Trump,” on a button. It was a 
day afterwards! We were all 
excited about doing it still at 
that point. Just being around 
that and being a part of it just 
kind of — I was feeling a lot of 
things all at the same time.

It wasn’t like, “Oh fuck, I 

gotta go write a record,” but 
I think that being done with 
all that, everything just felt 
different, and I really needed 
to decompress, and I feel like 
those are the moments where 
I’m at my best when it comes 
to writing. My friends Pete 
and Kara just happened to 
have a trailer up in the middle 
of nowhere, and I had a few 
weeks off, so I could just go 
up there for a week and demo 
and write and work on stuff, 
which is something I usually 
don’t have a chance to do. I 
went 
up 
basically 
straight 

from the Inauguration protest 
and the Women’s March. I 
maybe took a day to get all 
my shit together, then bought 
a synthesizer and went up to 
the mountains. I think that 
just feeling like I needed to 
decompress and try and take 
stock of everything was really 
important. I think that’s how 
those ambient passages ended 
up on the record, because 
that’s part of it. That’s part 
of being able to understand 
things, is giving yourself the 
time to understand things and 
be empathetic.

Michigan offense struggles in loss to Ohio State

Just when it looked like the 

ball would sneak into the net, 
Tommy Heidt reached behind 
himself and trapped it against 
the ground.

The 
senior 
goalkeeper 

prevented 
Ohio 
State 
(1-2 

Big Ten, 6-6 overall) from 
taking the lead over the No. 20 
Michigan men’s lacrosse team 
in the second quarter of Friday 
night’s game, but the Wolverines 
ultimately lost, 8-5.

Michigan (0-3 Big Ten, 7-5 

overall) gave up three goals in 
the first quarter while adding 
only one of its own, when junior 
midfielder Brent Noseworthy 
found 
twine 
on 
a 
man-up 

opportunity late in the opening 
stanza.

But once Heidt settled in 

and stood tall in the cage, the 
Buckeyes had to fight to score. 
Heidt’s ten first-half saves — 
sometimes in dramatic fashion 
— marked his highest save total 
in a first half this season.

“Tommy Heidt was the real 

show today,” said Michigan 
coach Kevin Conry. “He had 15 
saves, kept guys in the game, 
had fantastic energy regardless 
of the situation and really held 
command of the defense and the 
whole game. He was a real star 
today.”

While Heidt was controlling 

the defense, the Wolverines’ 
offense struggled to get going. 
Then, junior midfielder Decker 
Curran notched his first score 
of the day at the 12:27 mark 
of the second quarter, cutting 
Michigan’s deficit to only one.

Ten minutes later, freshman 

attacker 
Alex 
Buckanavage 

scored on a roll-out from behind 
the goal, getting underneath the 
defender to slip the ball between 
Ohio State goalkeeper Josh 
Kirson’s legs and tie the game.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

held the Buckeyes scoreless 
for a nearly 29-minute stretch 
going from 6:20 remaining in 

the first quarter through eight 
minutes into the third, frequent 
turnovers kept Michigan from 
earning a lead.

“In the third quarter, we 

kept turning the ball over in the 
offensive end and in the clearing 
game, which kept giving them 
second-chance opportunities,” 
Conry said. “Big Ten lacrosse 
is such a well-coached — such 
a tough conference that if you 
start 
giving 
teams 
multiple 

second-chance 
opportunities, 

they’re good enough to take 
advantage of it.”

Though 
freshman 
Connor 

Cronin has had success at the 
faceoff 
dot 
throughout 
the 

season, he struggled to win 
faceoffs in the second half. The 
difficulty 
limited 
offensive 

opportunities and required a lot 
of work from the defense, which 
wore down in the third quarter 
and allowed four goals.

“Connor Cronin’s been doing 

such a great job for us, and wing 
play has been so vital in all of 
our wins,” Conry said. “But 
when you’re playing defense 
over and over and over again, 
the guys wear down, and they’re 

the same guys we rely on to go 
up and take wings. I don’t think 
it was anything Connor did 
specifically, I think it was more 
just the three-man game got a 
little bit less effective.”

The lone Michigan goal in the 

third quarter came from junior 
attacker Rocco Sutherland to put 
the Wolverines at a 7-4 deficit. 
Curran added his second score 
of the day halfway through the 
fourth period, but it proved to be 
too little, too late. 

Turnovers ultimately doomed 

Michigan, 
as 
it 
could 
not 

capitalize on its opportunities in 
the fourth quarter, adding just 
one goal on seven shots while 
committing three turnovers.

“It’s our discipline and our 

attention to detail,” Conry said. 
“Right now, we’re just kinda 
doing some silly things … we’re 
just a young, inexperienced 
group who is playing in the best 
conference in lacrosse against 
some of the best teams in the 
country. And when you play 
against those teams, a lot of the 
turnovers that we were having 
earlier on in the season that 
weren’t getting exposed are 

starting to get exposed now.”

The turnover issue in Friday’s 

game is the continuation of a 
theme for the Wolverines, who 
have had double-digit turnovers 
in all three Big Ten games so far. 
With just two regular season 
games remaining, the issue has 
become top priority for Conry.

“We’ve been going back to 

basics the better part of two 
weeks here, and it’s already 
starting 
to 
show,” 
Conry 

said. “We’re down a couple 
turnovers. We didn’t have 18 
today, we didn’t have 15, we had 
13, so there is some marginal 
improvement there.

“If we can just keep chipping 

away at these turnovers, then 
we’re gonna be in a better 
position with our hands free and 
take good, fundamental shots. 
And once that happens, we’ll see 
the wins start to fall.”

The next two weeks will tell 

if the wins will fall in time for 
Michigan to earn a spot in the 
Big Ten Tournament, but with 
No. 4 Johns Hopkins coming 
to town next week, it may need 
more than fewer turnovers to 
notch a win.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

Senior goaltender Tommy Heidt kept the game scoreless for 29 minutes, but Michigan would inevitably fall.

BAILEY JOHNSON

Daily Sports Writer

Despite tough conditions, 
Mueller works way to 2nd

By the end of Saturday’s 

opening rounds, Kyle Mueller 
had worked his way into a good 
spot. The senior sat tied for 
second place — just one stroke 
off the lead — and would have a 
chance to make his move come 
Sunday.

Or so he thought.
Weather dictated otherwise. 

Overnight 
rain 
paired 
with 

strong winds made the course 
unplayable, 
canceling 
the 

final round of the Boilermaker 
Invitational in West Lafayette, 
Ind.

“It definitely felt a little 

strange,” said Michigan coach 
Chris Whitten. “We went to the 
golf course today really hoping 
to play. … It just wasn’t gonna be 
possible. … It’s one of those things 
we don’t have any control over.”

Mueller settled for a runner-

up finish at four-under par, 
while the Michigan men’s golf 
team finished in eighth with a 
587 (294 first 18, 293 second). 
Kent State and Northwestern 
co-championed the 17-team field, 
scoring eight strokes better than 
the Wolverines.

Though Mueller’s opportunity 

to win washed away with the 
rain, he still put his skills on 
display during Saturday’s 36 
holes.

Though there was no rain, 

heavy winds wreaked havoc for 
many — but not Mueller.

When it’s windy on the course, 

golfers who naturally play draws 
or fades struggle to adjust. This 
is where Mueller’s talent comes 
into play. Because of his straight 
ball flight, he’s able to better 
compensate for the wind. This 
helped him successfully navigate 
the course and post back-to-back 
70s while others stumbled.

“Generally, the thing that 

makes Kyle so good is his ball 

striking,” Whitten said. “He just 
hits the ball very solid and very 
straight. He rarely curves it off 
line very much. … Everyone else’s 
misses are amplified much more, 
and Kyle does very well.”

Five 
other 
Wolverines 

competed as well. Junior Nick 
Carlson and sophomore Brent 
Ito finished 62nd and 70th, 
respectively, while sophomore 
Taisei Negishi played as an 
individual and placed 92nd in the 
92-player field.

Freshmen Charlie Pilon and 

Henry Spring played well enough 
to impress Whitten, placing 12th 
and 56th.

“They’ve just become very 

good at adapting to whatever the 
weather or the circumstances 
are,” Whitten said. “That’s what 
you’ve gotta be able to do in 
college golf, so I was happy about 
that.”

Michigan improved by one 

stroke between the two rounds, 
which was much more significant 
than it may entail. The team’s 
first round score of 294 was only 
the eighth-best of that 18-hole 
stretch, but the Wolverines’ 293 
in round two marked the second-
best of that stage.

Whitten 
credits 
the 

improvement to his team’s calm 
during the storm, and thinks 
Michigan could have made some 
noise Sunday.

“The 
conditions 
yesterday 

were so tough,” Whitten said. 
“So, I would say the guys held 
their own and did a very good job 
of focusing in tough conditions. 
Even though we were eighth 
place, we were not that far behind 
the leader. That’s why we wanted 
to play today, because we really 
thought there was a good chance 
to move up.

“I 
think 
we 
had 
some 

momentum going.”

But the Wolverines never 

got the chance to build on that 
momentum.

A look inside the finances of a women’s basketball team

According to a financial report 

authored by the NCAA Membership 
Financial 
Reporting 
System 
— 

data requested in a Freedom of 
Information Act request submitted 
by The Michigan Daily and also in 
the Equity in Athletics Data Analysis 
report submitted by the University 
— the Michigan women’s basketball 
team spent just over $4 million in the 
2016-17 season.

With a roster of 15 student-

athletes, that comes out to $266,666 
per athlete each year, or $1.08 million 
over a four-year college career. For 
comparison, that equates to a year’s 
cost of attendance for about 27 out-of-
state or 40 in-state students.

Based on expense records found in 

the Equity in Athletics Data Analysis 
submitted by the University to the U.S. 
Department of Education, Michigan 
has spent an average of $2.66 million a 
year since 2003. When looking at the 
last five years, the Wolverines have 
disbursed an average of $3.5 million.

To put that in perspective, they 

made $407,000 in revenue last year.

The 
Michigan 
baseball 
and 

softball teams — squads with 
comparable revenue figures — spent 
significantly less than women’s 
basketball. According to the NCAA 
financial report, baseball spent $2.7 
million while softball spent $2.6 in the 
2016-2017 school year — meaning, the 
women’s basketball team spent about 
35 percent more. The hockey team, 
which had a revenue of $3.1 million, 
spent less than women’s basketball at 
$3.6 million.

In fact, the only two teams with 

higher 
expenses 
than 
women’s 

basketball were men’s basketball and 
football, with $8.8 million and $46.2 
million, respectively.

So where is the money going?
About 30 percent, or $1.22 million, 

of the team’s total expenses went to 
the coaching staff’s salary, benefits 
and bonuses. Head coach Kim Barnes 
Arico’s compensation was just shy 
of $693,000 while her assistants 
made $529,000 collectively. Arico’s 
total was the highest of any coach of 
a female sport at Michigan and the 
third-highest overall behind football 
coach Jim Harbaugh and men’s 
basketball coach John Beilein.

That’s an average salary relative to 

other Big Ten women’s coaches and 

is about half as much as Ohio State 
coach Kevin McGuff.

The next largest expense came in 

the form of athletic scholarships and 
aid. Of the 15 players on the roster, 
13.4 total scholarships were given out 
and one scholarship was attributed 
as a “exhausted eligibility or medical 
equivalency.” The total amount of 
financial assistance was $1.03 million.

Women’s basketball spent more 

on financial assistance last year than 
the total yearly operating expenses 
of the men’s golf team ($647,000) and 
the women’s golf team ($813,000) and 
about the same as men’s gymnastics, 
men’s and women’s tennis, water polo 
and wrestling.

The third-largest expenditure was 

the team’s in-season travel. Taking 
buses and chartered planes around 
the country ran up a tab of over 
$700,000. When including per diem 
and meals on road trips, that number 
rises well over $800,000.

How do they stack up in the Big 

Ten?

On the surface, the Wolverines’ 

expenses are large. However, relative 
to the rest of the Big Ten, Michigan 
is somewhat conservative. For the 
2015-16 season, the Wolverines had 
the fourth-lowest total operating 
expenses in the conference at $3.7 
million. Comparatively, the University 
of Nebraska, the University of 
Wisconsin and Ohio State University 
each spent over $5 million.

But where Michigan truly lags 

behind is its ability to make money.

The Wolverines had the Big Ten’s 

second-lowest 
operating 
revenue 

during 2015-16 at $328,000. Even 
with an $80,000 increase in total 
revenue for the 2016-17 season, 
Michigan still struggles to produce 
funds. The team made $168,000 from 
ticket sales and $48,000 from parking 
and concessions according to the 
NCAA financial report released.

With 53,400 fans attending games 

in 2016-17 according to the Big Ten 
and NCAA official websites. Dividing 
total season revenue — comprised of 
aspects such as ticket sales, parking 
and concessions at each game — 
by total attendees on the season, 
Michigan earned $4.04 per attendee. 
The Wolverines’ average attendance 
of 2,672 ranked ninth in the 
conference and 45th in the country.

Even if Michigan was to have the 

same attendance as South Carolina 
— the school with the nation’s highest 
attendance — the Wolverines still 
would’ve lost $3 million.

Michigan is a product of the 

system.

Yes, 
Michigan 
may 
have 

difficulties 
generating 
revenue. 

However, the scope of this dilemma 
expands beyond the Wolverines or 
even the Big Ten.

As a whole, NCAA women’s teams 

struggle to stay in the black.

Even the ultimate powerhouse 

Connecticut — a program that has 
made eleven consecutive Final Fours 
and has won ten national titles since 
2000 — isn’t profitable. In 2016-17, 
the Huskies produced a revenue 
of $3.55 million while spending an 

astronomical $7.9 million.

While Connecticut was able to 

make $2.18 million in ticket sales, 
its costly expenditures added up. 
The largest portion of the Huskies’ 
expenses went to Coach Geno 
Auriemma, who made $2.88 million 
last year. His staff added another $1 
million.

If 
you 
take 
the 
difference 

between Auriemma’s and Barnes 
Arico’s salaries and subtract that 
from Connecticut’s total expenses, 
the remaining figure is roughly 
$5.1 million – not too far off from 
Michigan’s expenses of $4 million.

But the Huskies aren’t the only 

elite women’s program losing money. 
Louisville – another team in this 
year’s Final Four and a perennially 
elite team – takes a financial loss. Last 
year, the Cardinals saw a revenue of 
$1.28 million while spending $4.8 
million.

Why aren’t women’s basketball 

programs making money?

The 
majority 
of 
women’s 

basketball programs aren’t profitable. 
In fact, many women’s basketball 
programs lose millions.

Title IX plays a factor in these lofty 

expenditure numbers.

In 1972, the Title IX Education 

Amendments were signed by former 
President 
Richard 
Nixon. 
The 

legislation dictated that no individual 
will be discriminated against due to 
their gender in educational programs. 
This includes athletics.

“No person in the United States 

shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded 

from participation in, be denied 
the benefits of, or be subject to 
discrimination under any educational 
program or activity receiving federal 
financial assistance,” Nixon said in 
1972.

Based on a report by the 

National 
Center 
for 
Education 

Statistics, between 2000 and 2016, 
postsecondary degrees obtained by 
women have increased; 7 percent in 
bachelor’s degrees and 4 percent for 
master’s or higher education.

The law has also helped increase 

gender equality in athletics. From 
2004 and 2010, women’s participation 
in NCAA Division I and III athletics 
has increased 14 percent, as well as 21 
percent in Division II.

The Women’s Sports Foundation 

explains how Title IX is enforced in 
regards to athletics.

“A three-part test for participation 

opportunities that determines if 
institutions provide female and 
male students with equal athletic 
opportunities.” Those three parts 
are 
“Proportionality,” 
“History 

and 
Continuing 
Practice,” 
and 

“Effectively 
Accommodating 

Interests and Abilities.”

Opportunities, 
however, 
don’t 

necessarily 
mean 
equivalent 

expenses.

“The only monetary requirement 

of Title IX deals with the area of 
scholarships. 
Scholarships 
must 

be allocated in proportion to the 
number of female and male students 
participating 
in 
intercollegiate 

athletics,” says the Women’s Sports 
Foundation on its website.

In an email to The Daily, University 

Associate Athletic Director Kurt 
Svoboda explained that the concept 
of proportionality means, “Males 
and females participate in athletics in 
numbers substantially proportional 
to their respective enrollments in 
school.”

Proportionality also applies to the 

total number of scholarships. Because 
schools typically must make up the 
number of scholarships awarded 
for sports with no female equivalent 
(such as football and wrestling), 
women’s teams often have more 
scholarships granted than their male 
counterparts.

This is clear in basketball, where 

the average Division I women’s 
program has 14 scholarships to men’s 
13, according to College Athletic 
Associations.

With the national average of a 

women’s basketball scholarship being 
about $17,000, according to a link 
provided by Svoboda via email to The 
Michigan Daily, the typical women’s 
college basketball program spends 
$238,000 on financial assistance.

At a school like Michigan, where 

out-of-state tuition can cost upwards 
of $62,000, scholarships for the 
women’s basketball program runs 
around $1 million.

Another contributing factor to 

these relatively high expenses is the 
high market rate for head coaches.

Based on a study conducted by 

AthleticDirectorU in partnership 
with USA Today, the average 
compensation of a women’s head 
coach in the Big Ten was $664,000 
in 2016-17. The highest conference 
average was the Atlantic Coast 
Conference, where coaches earned 
around $760,000.

Baylor coach Kim Mulkey had the 

highest reported total compensation 
of $1.88 million, while Adia Barnes of 
Arizona had the lowest at $235,000.

The system doesn’t look like it’ll 

change.

The high expenses of women’s 

college basketball teams are very 
much a byproduct of the system. In 
order to operate, major programs 
like Michigan are almost required 
to spend exorbitant sums on coaches 
and scholarships while generating 
relatively minimal fan draw, and thus, 
little revenue.

If this year’s Women’s Final Four is 

any indication, the trend will continue.

According to the NCAA, the 

women’s 
national 
championship 

game between Notre Dame and 
Mississippi State averaged 3.5 million 
viewers, reduced from 3.8 million 
last year. The entire women’s Final 
Four generated 7.62 million viewers 
– for comparison, the men’s semifinal 
games garnered 97 million.

All 
factors 
considered, 
it’s 

extremely difficult for any women’s 
college program to be profitable.

And Michigan is no different.
But with lucrative football and 

men’s basketball programs more than 
making up the difference, schools 
like Michigan can afford to spend 
on non-profitable sports. It’s clear 
the Wolverines invest in the optimal 
student-athlete experience. And it’s 
apparent that the women’s basketball 
team is an integral part of that 
experience, regardless of the finances.

MEN’S LACROSSE

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

The Michigan women’s basketball team ranked ninth in the Big Tenin average attendance.

HUNTER SHARF
Daily Sports Writer


Shattering expectations would 

be an understatement for the 
Michigan men’s basketball team in 
the 2017-18 season.

After a 26-12 record in 2016-

17 that ended in a heartbreaking 
Sweet Sixteen loss to Oregon, the 
Wolverines lost three valuable 
starters in Derrick Walton, D.J. 
Wilson and Zak Irvin. They were 
supposed to spend this season 
retooling, with a solid recruiting 
class waiting in the wings.

On numerous occasions, that 

looked to be the case. But as was 
the theme of the season, Michigan 
also won in almost every way 
imaginable — pretty and ugly 
— to notch a 33-8 record. It was 
good enough to face Villanova for 
the Wolverines’ second National 
Championship 
appearance 
in 

six years. It was good enough to 
win their second straight Big Ten 
Tournament. It was good enough 
to get the most wins in program 
history.

The Daily reflects on one of 

the most successful seasons in 
Michigan basketball history:

Best 
game: 
Michigan 
75, 

Purdue 66 in Big Ten Tournament 
championship

The Wolverines provided a few 

glimpses earlier in the season they 
could make a run in March, such 
as two convincing road wins to end 
the year and two wins over then-
top-10 Michigan State teams. But 
none encapsulated how efficient 
this team could be on both ends 
of the court then in the Big Ten 
Tournament championship.

After getting buried by 7-foot-

2 
Isaac 
Haas 
in 
Michigan’s 

previous two games against the 
Boilermakers, 
the 
Wolverines 

controlled the tempo from start to 
finish, stymying a top-five offense 
and shooting 50 percent from the 
floor. It also offered a posterizing 
slam in a breakout performance by 
sophomore center Jon Teske. Unlike 
the 2016-17 season, there was no 
intrigue from a scary plane crash or 

underdog mentality. Michigan won 
its second consecutive conference 
tournament 
championship 

convincingly and became one of 
the hottest teams in the country 
heading into March Madness.

Worst game: Northwestern 61, 

Michigan 52 on Feb. 6

In this snoozefest in Rosemont, 

Ill., Michigan shot a measly 38.6 
percent from the field, and couldn’t 
make the necessary stops against 
a smaller and slower Wildcats’ 
team. It looked like a contest that 
would position the Wolverines as a 
middle-of-the-pack Big Ten squad 
on the outside looking in.

The silver lining of this game 

for Michigan, though, is it marked 
when the Wolverines had had 
enough of lackluster showings. It 
was the last loss Michigan had until 
the National Championship game, 
and marked the start of an offensive 
emergence from senior guard 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman.

Best individual performance: 

Moritz Wagner against Loyola-
Chicago in the Final Four

If any game showed why 

Wagner is making the right call to 
enter the 2018 NBA Draft, it was his 
monstrous performance against 
the Ramblers in the Final Four. The 
junior center registered a 24-point, 
15-rebound output on 10-for-16 
shooting in the most significant 
game of his career. Wagner also 
recorded three steals to hush the 
naysayers about his shaky defense. 
Much of his work also came when 
Michigan needed it most — facing 
a three-point deficit with 7:44 
remaining in the contest. Wagner 
scored 11 of the team’s next 15 
points to put the game out of reach 
and secure a spot in the title game.

Most important game: Michigan 

64, Houston 63 in Round of 32

Yes, the National Championship 

game 
was 
pretty 
important. 

And so was the Final Four, Elite 
Eight and the Sweet Sixteen. But 
none of it would have happened 
without one the most iconic shots 
in Michigan basketball history. 
Flailing his legs after a rapid flick of 
the wrist, freshman guard Jordan 
Poole converted a 3-point, buzzer-

beating prayer to down the Cougars 
and earn a spot in the One Shining 
Moment video. In what was an 
otherwise uninspiring contest, the 
victory marked a true beginning to 
the Wolverines’ March Madness 
run and added another bullet point 
to the program’s and Beilein’s 
résumé.

Most improved player: Zavier 

Simpson

In his freshman season, Simpson 

looked like a lost puppy on the 
court, unable to be a trustworthy 
ball-handler or buy a bucket. For 
his sophomore campaign, the point 
guard was still a dog, but for all the 
right reasons. Labeled a “pitbull” 
by 
his 
teammates, 
Simpson 

convincingly grabbed the reins of 
the starting point guard role on 
Jan. 6 and ran with it.

He locked down his opponents 

nightly, earning him consideration 
as one of the premier on-ball 
defenders in the country. In the title 
game, Simpson held National Player 
of the Year Jalen Brunson to just 
nine points on 4-for-13 shooting. 
Offensively, while Simpson still 
has plenty of room to grow, he 
overcame his stocky stature to 
showcase a number of circus scoop 
shots and dribble penetration over 
some of the nation’s best shot-
blockers — think Haas, Mo Bamba, 
Jaren Jackson Jr. Given his impact 
on the court, Simpson is clearly the 
most improved player on Michigan, 
even if a statline won’t show it.

Most valuable player: Moritz 

Wagner

This decision isn’t as easy as 

it seems. The Wolverines were 
a Jenga tower that could fall by 
taking out any one player out of the 
lineup. But Wagner was at the base 
of it all. The junior averaged 14.6 
points and 7.1 boards after posting 
just 12.1 points and 4.2 rebounds a 
season ago. Besides against Loyola-
Chicago, 
Wagner’s 
standout 

performances include nine other 
20-point games and seven double-
doubles. Wagner, as evidenced by 
his on-court antics, also proved 
himself to be a capable, vocal 
leaderas a captain. Between his 
shifty offensive skillset, growing 

defensive prowess and leadership, 
he was able to help Michigan to the 
Final Four, and could soon make an 
NBA team very happy.

Up next:
Speaking in formalities, the only 

next step for Michigan is winning 
the 
National 
Championship. 

In reality, the goal will just be 
sustaining a top-tier program 
that is losing three of its biggest 
contributors — Abdur-Rahkman 
and 
fifth-year 
senior 
Duncan 

Robinson to graduation and, as of 
Saturday afternoon, Wagner to 
the NBA. Jaaron Simmons is also 
graduating, forcing the Wolverines 
to find a replacement for the 
backup point guard role. The team 
is also waiting on an NBA decision 
by Matthews. Finally, sophomore 
guard Ibi Watson and walk-on 
Brett Hibbitts announced their 

intentions to transfer, opening up 
roster spots and more playing time 
in the backup ‘2’ role.

But the new faces coming to 

Ann Arbor compose one of the best 
recruiting classes in the Beilein era. 
Beilein isn’t one to tout rankings, 
but the five-man class composes 
four four-stars and one three-star 
recruit for the 16th-best incoming 
group in the country, according 
to 247Sports. All five recruits play 
one starting role: David DeJulius 
at point guard, Adrien Nunez at 
shooting guard, Ignas Brazdeikis 
at small forward, Brandon Johns at 
power forward and Colin Castleton 
at center.

On 
paper, 
Michigan 
is 

introducing new pieces that can 
begin replacing the firepower it 
loses. But it also can look forward 
to the development of other players 

who made significant strides this 
year. Simpson has always held 
his own on defense, but showed 
noticeable progression in finding 
scoring 
opportunities 
as 
the 

season went on. Teske, who will 
likely replace Wagner at the ‘5’, 
grew more and more assertive 
and even showcased a mid-range 
jumper late in the year. And the 
rising sophomores — Poole, Isaiah 
Livers and Eli Brooks — enter the 
year with a full season of college 
basketball under their belts.

Next season, the Wolverines 

will likely find themselves in the 
preseason Associated Press Top 
25 poll. Unlike most of last season, 
they will have a target on their 
backs from the get-go, inviting the 
possibility of another compelling, 
new-look Michigan team in 2018-
19.
