About 50 Ann Arbor residents 
and University of Michigan 
students gathered in the Ann 
Arbor District Library to learn 
about the future of artificial 
intelligence on Friday night. 
The talk, titled “Artificial 
Intelligence 
and 
Finance,” 
featured Engineering professors 
Rada Mihalcea and Michael 
Wellman, who discussed how 
AI will affect trading in the 
financial world. 
Mihalcea 
started 
the 
conversation by asking Wellman 
about his interest in AI and what 

keeps him in the field. 
“Even in the 1980s, it was 
clear to me that the future of 
the world was going to be the 
future of intelligent machines,” 
Wellman said. “It was pretty 
inevitable that computers would 
eventually be able to do some of 
the things that people do, and 
maybe even do it better.” 
According 
to 
Wellman, 
the 
2008 
financial 
crisis 
demonstrates 
why 
AI 
is 
important when it comes to 
finance. He said AI would 
not repeat the same problems 
experienced a little more than a 
decade ago because algorithms 
can forego human error. 

“We know what happens 
when a financial system does 
not work,” Wellman said. “In 
2008, we experienced that when 
things don’t quite match up in 
the financial system, the whole 
economy goes for a tailspin. 
The financial crisis of 2008 
— we lost trillions of dollars 
of productivity, even though 
there was no natural disaster, 
no resources were destroyed … 
it was just a miscoordination 
of decisions that people were 
making.” 
Wellman 
said 
many 
companies may have already 
started 
algorithmic 
trading, 
which is when an automated 

trading system uses computer 
programs hardwired with a 
specific 
set 
of 
instructions 
to place a trade. During this 
process, decisions are made very 
quickly. 
“We talk about decisions being 
made in the blink of an eye,” 
Wellman said. “Well, the blink 
of an eye is 300 milliseconds, so 
computers can make dozens or 
hundreds of decisions back and 
forth in that time per trade and 
that is a key reason why it’s been 
inevitable that computers would 
take over a lot of activity because 
they can react to information so 
much faster than people can.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The second annual Women 
Who 
Launch 
symposium, 
held Friday morning in the 
Ross 
School 
of 
Business, 
focused on women working 
in venture capital who have 
founded their own successful 
companies. 
Women Who Launch is 
an 
organization 
founded 
at the Business School that 
focuses 
on 
equal 
gender 
representation and promoting 
an equitable environment at 
the University of Michigan, 
particularly for those who 
have moved into their own 
business fields. 
The 
symposium 
was 
comprised of several events 
with the second half of the 
day featuring four female 
venture capitalists. 
The first to speak was 
Natalie Fratto, vice president 
of 
firmwide 
strategy 
at 
Goldman Sachs. She also 

delivered a prominent TED 
Talk on the importance of 
adaptability in July 2019. 
Fratto is in the process of 
building 
the 
organization 
“Launch with GS,” Goldman 
Sachs’s 
$500 
million 
investment strategy which 
aims 
to 
create 
success 
through diversity.
“Through 
Launch 
With 
GS, Goldman Sachs aims to 
increase access to capital 
and facilitate connections for 
women, Blacks, Latinos and 
other diverse entrepreneurs 
and investors,” Fratto said.
Fratto said founders should 
be able to stand out when 
describing their company and 
pitching it to others. 
“I think great founders 
have the ability to have an 
answer and get their talking 
points out no matter what the 
question is,” Fratto said.

Conference 
 
brings about 
 
dialogue on 
social issues

In celebration of its opening 
earlier this month, the College 
of Literature, Science and the 
Arts building hosted the LSA 
Homewarming Party for LSA 
students Friday afternoon. The 
event, attended by about 1,200 
students, featured Reggie the 
Campus Corgi, as well as free food 
and Michigan gear. 

Some of the changes to the 
building included a new second 
floor with desks and conference 
rooms. The first floor has additional 
space for studying and student 
collaboration. LSA senior Cassidy 
Guros, sociology and women’s 
studies major, is in the LSA 
building often because it houses 
the Department of Sociology. 
Guros 
noted 
the 
differences 
between the building before and 
after it underwent renovations.

“(The change) is like night and 
day,” Guros said. “It makes me feel 
like I’m even more appreciated as 
a student because I have a space 
that’s dedicated to me and my 
studies.”
LSA Dean Anne Curzan, whose 
office has been in the LSA building 
throughout the renovation, also 
attended the event, taking the 
opportunity to speak to students in 
a more informal setting. 
“We hope this space will be 

a home base for LSA students,” 
Curzan said in an interview with 
The Daily. “When you ask students 
‘Where is LSA?’ they will often say 
it’s kind of everywhere, which is 
true. We also wanted students to 
feel like there was a center, there 
was a home base for them to go, 
so this space is designed to be a 
center for some key resources for 
students.”

According 
to 
Turpin, 
some of these projects are 
in coordination with NASA, 
adding the two organizations 
hope to have astronauts on the 
moon by 2024. 
“Now Boeing is taking a 
unique approach,” Turpin said. 
“Because we build the Space 
Launch System, we’re building 
so much capability into our 
rockets, and we’re taking five 
steps to learn (from our past 
flights) so we can shorten our 
path … We want to be (on the 
moon in) about 2024.” 
Turpin also discussed the 
company’s mission of closing 
the 
global 
digital 
divide, 
noting the disparities between 
developed 
and 
developing 

countries 
regarding 
their 
access 
to 
computing 
and 
information resources such as 
the internet.
Turpin 
noted 
Boeing 
is 
making efforts to bring this 
kind of technology and other 
digital 
opportunities 
to 
countries that may need them.
“It’s 
not 
just 
about 
communicating 
across 
transoceanic 
distances, 
but 
it’s about bringing the world 
together 
and 
closing 
the 
digital divide,” Turpin shared. 
Turpin 
said 
he 
feels 
passionate 
about 
Boeing’s 
humanitarian work because 
it helps people find water 
supplies and other life-saving 
resources.
“Having a solar-powered 
terminal in regions where 
the internet has never existed 
has completely changed the 

dynamic of the region,” Turpin 
said. “Things like where to find 
water, and other humanitarian 
needs, 
situations 
where 
you 
lost 
communication 
or 
infrastructure, 
natural 
disasters like in Puerto Rico. 
Whenever 
this 
happens 
around 
the 
world, 
this 
class of satellites is able to 
be repositioned to support 
services for those who need 
them.” 
Layla Allen, a student at 
Davis 
Aerospace 
Technical 
High School, said she enjoyed 
learning about the company 
from an actual employee who 
works there. 
“It was very informational,” 
Allen said. “I liked having 
someone 
from 
the 
actual 
company come and give us 
information because it made it 
seem more factual rather than 

somebody 
just 
interpreting 
something straight from the 
internet.”
Similarly, 
Engineering 
sophomore 
Edward 
Tang 
said he felt the lecture was 
insightful 
and 
gave 
him 
information about the future 
of a field he would like to 
pursue. 
“He 
definitely 
offered 
insight on the industry as an 
industry expert that’s been 
there for 20 years, challenges 
that you might face in a pretty 
homogenized 
engineering 
field such as aerospace and 
also pretty good insight on 
where the future of aerospace 
engineering, as a whole, is 
heading towards, which is the 
industry that I will be working 
in, in the next 20 years,” Tang 
said. 

Mihalcea 
asked 
Wellman 
how the trading systems will be 
regulated and if they have any 
human involvement to make sure 
they adhere to the law. Wellman 
said though there are laws in 
place, there are no audit systems 
to make sure these systems are 
behaving in a legal manner. 
Therefore, he said algorithms 
may still be able to find loopholes.
“Certainly in regulated areas, 
including 
markets 
or 
credit 
and 
lending, 
decisions 
made 
by algorithms are still subject 

under the law,” Wellman said. 
“The laws are written under 
the presumption that people 
are 
making 
decisions. 
We 
lack, I’m afraid, thoughtfully 
designed audit systems and other 
regulatory ways ensuring that 
we really do understand how 
decisions are made.” 
For 
the 
remaining 
time, 
the audience asked Wellman 
questions. One individual asked 
what the future of AI will look 
like when it comes to people 
searching for jobs. Wellman said 
he believes people will still be 
able to find jobs in the market, 
though AI will play a larger part 
in trading in the future. 

“The 
substrate 
of 
trading 
will be algorithmic and people 
will be involved in tweaking the 
strategies and coming up with 
new ideas and putting them in 
there,” Wellman said. “But it’s 
not going to ever revert back to 
mainly manual trading.”
LSA 
sophomores 
Madison 
Caldwell and Reagan Miller are 
computer science majors with 
an interest in AI. Miller said he 
thought this event would help 
further his knowledge as he 
progresses in his academic career. 
“I haven’t been to one of these 
before, it’s definitely a first time,” 
he said. “We’re both sophomores 
so we’re kind of getting out there 

right about now, especially since 
we are getting more into the 
upper-level classes. It’s cool to see 
some of the things that are going 
to be happening and impacting us 
in general.”
Caldwell said she thought the 
event was especially interesting 
because it offered a real-world 
perspective on AI.
“It was interesting to see it from 
a community perspective instead 
of just a classroom setting,” she 
said. “I feel like people bring 
different perspectives and some 
of the questions that people asked 
I would never have thought of.”

One of these resources is 
the Opportunity Hub, which 
returned back to its original 
location on the first floor from 
the 
second 
floor 
following 
renovations. 
Jessica 
St. 
George, 
information 
services 
coordinator at the Opportunity 
Hub, 
helped 
with 
the 
tabling and trivia game the 
Hub 
provided 
during 
the 
Homewarming Party.
“I think it’s going to make a 
huge impact on how we serve 

the community because we’re 
the central point in a public 
space now,” St. George said. 
“It’s going to be important for 
us to be very visible to students 
and also to learn more about 
what the students want and 
what they need as they come 
through and experience the 
new space.”
According 
to 
Curzan, 
the 
theme 
of 
the 
event 
“Homewarming” came from 
this idea that the LSA building 
would serve as a home for the 
college moving forward.
“We knew that we wanted 
the event to be fun and to 
feel really welcoming for all 
LSA students because we see 

this as the new home for LSA 
students,” Curzan said. “We 
want students to feel like this 
is a home base for them, so we 
designed this to have games 
and comfort food and to make 
this feel like a homewarming 
party.”
LSA 
freshman 
Regan 
Monnett attended the event to 
take advantage of some of these 
free giveaways. Monnett said 
she usually goes to the Shapiro 
Undergraduate 
Library 
to 
study, but after visiting the LSA 
building, that could change. 
“I definitely want to come 
back here when I have stuff to 
do, as a study space,” Monnett 
said. “I like the modern feel of 

it.”
In addition to going there to 
study, Curzan said she hoped 
students would also utilize the 
LSA building for collaboration, 
meeting friends and hanging 
out.
“One of the messages that 
we want to send is that this is 
a college where we talk about 
really important issues and we 
challenge ourselves and we ask 
hard questions,” Curzan said. 
“We also celebrate the joy of 
doing this kind of work and 
the fact that we also play with 
ideas, so these themes of joy 
and play alongside rigor and 
challenge really matter to us.”

As soon as I stepped into the 
harshly-lit, humid and ever-
so-crowded 
Beirut 
airport, 
familiarity flooded my senses. 
Anxiety did as well, as it 
had ever since I boarded the 
plane from Rome. I was going 
to visit my extended family 
alone after completing a study 
abroad program in Greece, 
one I deliberately chose for 
its proximity to Lebanon. My 
sleepless eyes gazed through 
crowds 
of 
restless 
people 
trying to get home, scanning 
for a familiar face, until they 
finally settled on one — my 
cousin, ten years older than he 
was the last time I saw him. 
His eyes were the same kind 
ones I remembered, and they 
instantly filled me with relief. 
My 
cousin 
drove 
me 
through 
narrow, 
bumpy 
streets of Beirut, through the 
neighborhood that for so long 
existed only in fragmented 
memories in the back of my 
mind, coming to the forefront 
in the presence of certain 
smells, pictures or feelings: the 

A Tribute to Home

Why I Joined MiC

During my first semester writing 
for the Michigan Daily I noticed 
myself wanting to write more 
about my experience as a freshman 
of color. Because what I’ve realized 
the past several months is how 
much race seemingly plays a 
significant role in creating new 
relationships. Back home, even 
though my high school friends and 
I come from different religious, 
socioeconomic, ethnic, and racial 

CHERYN HONG
Assistant MiC Editor

I want to learn myself. 
I want to learn my power 
of voice. I want to learn 
my heart, my trials, my 
confusions and my strength. 
I often shy from that which 
I need: self-love, affection, 
my own art, my own words 
and thoughts. When I say shy 
from, I mean avoid. When I 
say avoid, I mean run, or hide. 
I grew up in a space that 
encouraged this avoidance 
of self because that self was 
black. I had to force love 
upon myself, and cultural 
education 
came 
from 
nowhere but home. School 
meant being called a n***er 
in the hallway on my way to 
learn the benefits of French 
colonization. School meant 
defending my collar bone, my 
calves, my thighs, hips, and 
hair to the lacrosse players 
who joked that I belonged 
on 
the 
team. 
Isolation 
became a beautiful place, 
where I could craft my own 
curriculum and create my 
own assignments. Those took 
the shape of poems about my 
body, my heart, my people. 
They embraced the thoughts 
I wildly feared, and the fears 
I perpetually thought of. My 
journal and my laptop became 
a home and a school that was

void of everything but me. For 
years that is what my writing 
has been: just me, alone. 
What I have realized is that 
it is okay to share. Maybe even 
necessary. Maybe refusing to 
share is why I am so scared of 
my work, or scared to claim a 
title as a ‘writer.’ Maybe I can 
inspire the way I am inspired. 

That is why I am here: to learn 
from others and myself. I am 
so honored to be welcomed by 
this team. I am so grateful to be 
offered this outlet of inspiration 
and culture and love. I want to 
thank Michigan in Color for 
accepting me, and for believing 
in my thoughts. I cannot wait to 
get to work.

backgrounds, the extent of our 
differences never interfered with 
our capacity of connection and 
intimacy. 
The past several months I have 
been diminishing a large part of my 
identity. I began to forget certain 
Korean words because I didn’t 
want to speak my native tongue in 
front of my white peers. I started to 
eat less East Asian foods I craved 
because they were “too smelly” or 
“gross.” I detached myself from 
anything “oriental” because I didn’t 
want to become an Asian culture 
and heritage guide in social groups. 

Her voice was like shea butter, from
African trees where healing grows 
Her skin was the bark, pushing
through clay and stony soil and racism
Her hair was the branches, carrying
the fruit of Black resistance and hope
Her words were the green leaves, growing
against the drought of the Sahara, or
the America, or the (mis)education
which seeks to quench her message, the 
water upon the seed of MLK’s dream:
That we would learn to live together and love one another.

in the recesses of my mind 
that I was never able to quite 
put together, but appreciated 
nonetheless.
On the 2am drive to my 
grandma’s house where I would 
be staying, my cousin and I 
exchanged few words. I told 
him he had changed; he told 
me I had too. We exchanged 
questions of how the flight 
was and how we’ve been as I 
stared out the window and took 
in the sights- towering faded 
buildings, balconies decorated 
with clothes lines, little shops 
closed for the night. There was 
so much I wanted to say and ask 
him, but I couldn’t bring myself 
to formulate words. My heart 
was jumping with excitement 
and nerves- after not being here 
for so long, I worried about all 
that I had missed. So much had 
changed in the past decade- 
and I worried 12 days would not 
be enough time to catch up, to 
rekindle that sense of home that 
I used to feel in Lebanon. Even 

worse, I worried that I would 
not be able to connect to my 
family anymore and that they 
would regard me as an outsider, 
because after all, I was.
In the days to come, nothing 
would prepare me for the 
overwhelming feelings that I 
would experience — nostalgia 
most of all. Memories I forgot 
I even had were revived as 
old traditions were revisited. 
My short stay in Lebanon 
consisted of family gatherings 
every single day — a room full 
of aunts, uncles, cousins, all 
gathered in my grandmother’s 
house, eating on a spread of 
newspapers on the floor. It 
consisted of sweltering heat 
and periodic power outages 
and motorcycles buzzing and 
card games until morning. I 
met new family members, as 
the passage of time had brought 
them into my life. So much had 
changed; we were no longer the 
uninhibited little kids we used 
to be, unaware and unbothered 
by 
the 
disconnect 
that 
is 
created by living worlds away. 
I was aware of every awkward 
pause, every forgotten Arabic 
word, every relative’s different 
life that I was so out of touch 

with. 
But 
the 
unequivocal 
pull of family, the love that 
traverses time zones, oceans 
and decades, was still the same, 
and I imagine it always will be. 
In 
my 
Grandma’s 
spare 
bedroom, where my cousins 
and I were staying, there was a 
little wallet-sized picture of my 
mom as a teenager tucked into 
the side of the mirror. My mom, 
the youngest of 11 siblings, the 
first and only one to move to 
America after marriage, the 
one that left everything she 
knew and loved and risked it all 
at the tender age of 18. I felt her 
presence with me in Lebanon, 
in the way her siblings would 
talk 
about 
her, 
remarking 
about how much I resemble her 
both in physical features and 
mannerisms. I saw her eyes in 
my Teta’s, as she held my hand 
and recounted stories about my 
cousins and me so many years 
ago. I tried to imagine what 
she was like in her younger 
days, surrounded by family 
and her language and free from 
the bounds of stress that come 
with immigration. In all the old 
pictures, she’s always smiling 
big, looking carefree and happy. 
I wondered what her life could 
have or would have looked like 
had it taken a different course. 
I wondered who I would be 
had she stayed, had I grown up 
there with all of my cousins, had 
I never known the balancing 
and clashing of two identities 
as they fought tirelessly to 
reconcile their differences. But 
that reality is only a distant 
dream, and for now I choose 
to enjoy the nuances that come 
with who I am. 
I felt insanely lucky to be 
there, to have these roots, to 
belong somewhere that expects 
nothing of me except to keep it 
in my memory. I felt lucky and 
undeserving of the out-pour 
of love from all of my family 
members — the way they put all 
of their responsibilities on hold 
to make sure I had the best time 
I possibly could. The way they 
finished my sentences when I 
struggled to make a coherent 
thought in Arabic instead of 
dwelling on my mistake. To 
my aunts who invited me for 
breakfast and dinner every 
day, my grandma who spent 
hours making food she knew I 

liked, my cousins who took off 
work to spend time with me. To 
the owner of the corner store 
a block from my grandma’s 
house who surprisingly still 
remembered me and whose 
eyes lit up when I walked in. 
The days went by fast, too 
fast. It was time to pack my 
bags for a final time and make 
the journey home, much before 
I was ready to say goodbye. 
The drive to the airport was 
silent and tearful, the car 
overflowing with my suitcases 
and my cousins who insisted on 
coming along, and in true Arab 
fashion we stayed hugging in 
the airport much longer than 

we needed to. 
People 
wonder 
how 
you 
can be so connected to a place 
you are so geographically far 
away from, how you can feel so 
strongly for people you see once 
every decade if you’re lucky, 
how you hold on to a language 
that seems to fall apart in your 
mouth. I don’t know how to 
describe it, other than that 
home never really leaves you. 
While I left feeling incomplete, 
I also felt a piece of me come 
back that I never even knew I 
missed; now I’m counting down 
the days until I can go back 
home again.

“I feel most colored when I 
am thrown against a sharp white 
background.” Zora Neale Hurston 
encompasses how I feel, because 
I was detaching myself from my 
race as it was the most salient trait 
people here noticed about me. I 
have never felt more Asian, Korean, 
yellow and ashamed. While I 
haven’t 
experienced 
blatant 
discrimination or racism, there 
are subtle moments of ignorance 
or stereotypes that I have been 
confronted with, which has made 
me feel alienated from my peers. 
I want a balance between white-
washing myself and restricting my 
social circles to people who look 
like me. I will go through life with 
a one-dimensional lens, however, 
the more I immerse myself with 
a diverse group of peers, the more 
empathetic, understanding and 
multi-dimensional my perspective 
will 
become. 
And 
in 
short, 
Michigan in Color combines my 
zeal for writing and allows me 
to express my racially charged 
stories freely, without sacrificing or 
completely taking over my identity. 
I’m using my position in this 
section to finally allow myself to 
revel in the fact that I am a proud 
Korean-American and exemplify 
how much of an impact my 
ethnicity and race has towards 
how I view myself. But more 
importantly, I’m using my position 
to learn from others: people who 
have both similar and different 
experiences of people of color 
against a sharp white background.

A lack of visibility perpetuated by the debates

I

n a crowded field of 
Democratic hopefuls, it’s 
easy for the candidates 
to get lost and go unnoticed 
by voters, so we turn to the 
debates. Each of the debates 
has brought up hot-topic issues 
such as healthcare, foreign 
policy and electability, but has 
left LGBTQ+ issues largely 
untouched. The absence of 
questions 
and 
substantive 
policy stances leaves LGBTQ+ 
voters underrepresented and 
often unacknowledged by a 
party they widely support. 
With 
seven 
Democratic 
debates 
under 
our 
belts, 
only one featured a question 
pertaining to LGBTQ+ issues. 
The question posed during the 
December debate pertained to 
the disproportionate killings 
of 
transgender 
people 
of 
color. The progressives, Sen. 
Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., 
and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 
were given the opportunity 
to respond before the topic 
shifted 
to 
Afghanistan. 
I 
applaud the question, but the 
lack of attention regarding the 
health and safety of LGBTQ+ 
Americans 
across 
seven 
debates highlights a bigger 
issue in the Democratic Party. 
The 
Democratic 
Party 
has long benefited from its 
diverse coalition, especially 
in the most recent elections 
with 
voter 
support 
from 
people of color and LGBTQ+ 
individuals. NBC’s 2018 exit 
polling showed that 82 percent 
of LGBTQ+ individuals voted 
Democrat, 
second 
only 
to 
Black voters with 90 percent 
support. So why do the debates 
lack questions regarding the 
marginalized 
communities 
that propel them into office? 
Put simply, the Democrats are 
targeting and attempting to 
appeal to independents, and in 
the process taking advantage 
of the communities they rely 
on. This sense of reliability 
and comfort with LGBTQ+-
identifying 
individuals 
has manifested in the lack 
of attention shown on the 
national stage. 
LGBTQ+ voters have not 
been prioritized, let alone 
recognized, by candidates in 
past election cycles. But with 
burgeoning 
visibility 
and 

representation in office, it’s 
past due for acknowledgement. 
Though there was a rare 
forum dedicated to LGBTQ+ 
issues back in September, it 
gathered less than 60,000 
views on YouTube as it lacked 
the national attention and 
recognition the debates hold. 
The forum does not compare 
to the 18 million and 15 
million viewers, respectively, 
that tuned into the first round 
of record-breaking debates. 
In addition, the town hall 
format of the forum did not 
provide candidates any time 
to actually debate the plans 
and policies they preached. 
The policies and stances that 
candidates hold on LGBTQ+ 
issues 
deserve 
national 
attention, 
not 
just 
niche 
forums. 

Most Americans do not 
know the policy issues that 
impact LGBTQ+ individuals, 
because it does not affect 
them directly. While this is 
somewhat 
understandable, 
the 
debates 
serve 
as 
a 
platform for voters to learn 
about different policy points 
and where they stand on these 
issues. Furthermore, Public 
Religion Research Institute 
(PRRI) found that 80 percent 
of 
Americans 
wrongfully 
believe that there are federal 
employment protections in 
place for LGBTQ+ individuals. 
This lack of understanding 
stems 
from 
the 
relative 
invisibility that the LGBTQ+ 
community endures in the 
media, government and often 
our day-to-day lives. 
While the general LGBTQ+ 
population 
is 
relatively 
small, the issues that plague 
the 
community 
were 
not 
solved with the legalization 
of 
same-sex 
marriage 
in 

2015. In fact, the issues of 
healthcare, 
homelessness 
and 
equal 
treatment 
in 
the 
workplace 
affect 
the 
LGBTQ+ community greater 
than the general population. 
Currently, nearly one-third 
of the transgender population 
lives in poverty, 52 percent of 
LGBTQ+ individuals live in 
a state without employment 
protections and 40 percent of 
homeless youth are LGBTQ+-
identifying. The Democratic 
nominee will be tasked with 
representing 
the 
LGBTQ+ 
individuals 
that 
make 
up 
their electorate. 
Despite 
the 
challenges 
facing 
visibility 
and 
the 

general 
conversation 

about LGBTQ+ issues, it is 
important to highlight that 
many of the candidates have 
included 
LGBTQ+ 
people 
in some broader responses 
throughout 
the 
debates. 
In the most recent debate, 
Warren closed by highlighting 
what the candidates did not 
have the chance to discuss, 
which included the issues 
plaguing 
the 
transgender 
community. Candidates, like 
Warren, should be prompted 
to discuss these policy issues 
in 
a 
structured 
setting, 
rather than in buried plans 
on websites and via name-
dropping during responses. 
The 
perpetual 
lack 
of 
visibility 
and 
protection 
for us LGBTQ+ individuals 
expresses 
to 
voters 
that 
our priorities are not being 
championed 
by 
the 
party 
we largely rely on. In an 
election that is crucial for the 
trajectory of LGBTQ+ rights 
in the face of Preident Donald 
Trump’s 
administration’s 
anti-LGBTQ + agenda, the 
Democratic 
Party 
must 
introduce 
LGBTQ+ 
policy 
issues to the debate stage 
and shine a light on one 
of its most reliable voting 
groups. 
This 
need 
for 
debate 
and 
conversation 
applies to all marginalized 
communities that feel largely 
underrepresented by a party 
that claims to champion the 
inclusion of all.

Though 
the 
situation 
seems to have died down, 
there is still uncertainty over 
the future of the conflict. 
Many worry the situation in 
Iran will become America’s 
next Iraq or Afghanistan, 
an asymmetric war with no 
clear end in sight. As students 
mostly born between 1998 and 
2001, our country has been at 
war for longer than we can 
remember. The only legacy we 
know has been a foreign policy 
of escalating violence in the 
Middle East, a policy we as 
The Michigan Daily Editorial 
Board do not feel represents 
our generation’s values.
President Donald Trump’s 
administration 
has 
been 
unclear 
as 
to 
why 
the 
assassination occurred. The 
Department 
of 
Defense’s 
justification 
has 
been 
ambiguous, convoluted and 
contradictory. 
Initially, 
sources from the Pentagon to 
the White House said the U.S. 
targeted Soleimani because 
he was planning an imminent 
attack on U.S. embassies in 
the Middle East. Later, Trump 
declared it was retribution for 
the killing of a U.S. contractor 
in an Iraqi airbase and the 
protest at the U.S. embassy 
in 
Baghdad. 
Conflicting 
accounts 
raise 
questions 
of how these decisions are 
being made. The lack of clear 
reasoning behind the strikes 
calls 
into 
question 
their 
necessity and the legitimacy 
of 
an 
administration 
that 
is 
not 
transparent 
in 
its 
decision-making process.
Foreign policy decisions are 
supposed to be tightly vetted 
and 
challenged 
through 
research 
and 
deliberation. 
Staffers will usually present 
the president with a number 
of options to respond with. 
In this case, Trump chose the 
most extreme. This change 
in precedent is due to the 
startling lack of experience 
in the executive branch. A 
majority 
of 
Trump’s 
war 
cabinet has been in office 
for less than a year, and 88 
positions in the executive 
branch, such as Secretary of 
the Navy, remained unfilled. 
The 
lack 
of 
transparency 
on this issue is worrying, 
especially to our generation, 
because we feel that those in 
charge are out of touch with 
what we want.
The 
morning 
after 
the 
attacks, people flooded social 

media platforms like Twitter, 
Facebook and Instagram with 
memes and jokes about the 
night’s events. Nervous that 
this was one of the most severe 
escalations of violence in our 
conscious lives, young people 
initially 
panicked 
about 
everything from an attack on 
American soil to being drafted 
in a potential World War III, 
with tweets circulating like @
jadenonfirree’s viral “When 
you realize #WWIII is the 
first meme of 2020 and it might 
be the last.” These jokes died 
down over the next couple of 
days as Iran, understanding 
that a war with the U.S. is not 
in its best interests, stepped 
back from the conflict.

Nevertheless, 
our 
generation’s confusion at the 
prospect of war with Iran 
reveals that we are unaware 
of the actual impact that 
a war would have on U.S. 
citizens. 
Discussions 
and 
demonstrations 
on 
campus 
against 
these 
extended 
military conflicts coupled with 
relatively little change over the 
past couple years justifies our 
concern that these situations 
could 
reasonably 
escalate 
into a larger war. Moreover, 
the Trump administration’s 
erratic approach toward Iran 
— they called off an airstrike 
in the eleventh hour last year 
— makes it harder for both 
countries to broker a peace 
deal and for our allies to count 
on our commitment to them.
Given 
that 
most 
young 
Americans 
are 
physically 
removed from the scene of the 
conflict in the Middle East, 
our nervous jokes and memes 
reflect a detachment from the 
consequences of a war with 
Iran. We could at least take 
comfort in knowing that most 
of us would not be directly 
affected by such a conflict. 
However, this scare was much 
more extreme for Iranians. 
They would almost surely bear 
the brunt of any prolonged 

conflict, just as Iraq has for 
theirs. An estimated 200,000 
Iraqi civilians have died since 
the start of the Iraq War, 
and a war with Iran would 
likely also yield a great many 
casualties. 
In 
comparison, 
only 4,419 American soldiers 
and 13 Department of Defense 
civilians were killed in the 
Iraq 
War, 
revealing 
the 
disproportionate 
effects 
American 
interventionism 
has 
on 
foreign 
nations. 
While young people in the 
U.S. responded to the events 
through memes, the effects 
were much more concrete for 
Iranians, who had to confront 
the terrifying proposition of 
their country being bombed 
and attacked. It is important 
for Americans to keep things 
in perspective, and understand 
that 
the 
people 
with 
the 
most to lose in a war are not 
our compatriots, but rather 
Iranians who did not ask to be 
put in this situation. 
While the conflict with Iran 
ultimately did not escalate 
after Soleimani’s killing, it is 
undeniable that it could have 
worsened 
drastically. 
The 
strike was ordered by a rogue 
administration acting without 
the knowledge or consent of 
the legislative branch, a move 
that undermines the principles 
at the core of the U.S.’s political 
system. 
As 
Americans, 
students and supporters of 
our democracy, we demand 
more 
transparency 
from 
our executive branch. Our 
government 
is 
elected 
to 
serve the people and should 
act rationally with the aim of 
keeping us out of unpopular, 
dangerous military situations. 
Additionally, 
being 
largely 
removed 
from 
the 
direct 
conflict, 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students 
must 
work to contextualize their 
response to the threat of 
war and have more empathy 
for those who would have 
been most gravely affected 
by this conflict. Lastly, if we 
want change in our foreign 
policy, we must take action to 
enact it. We urge students to 
strive for increased political 
engagement, 
especially 
in 
light of the upcoming 2020 
elections. Oppose unnecessary 
military action against Iran, 
call for transparency from 
the 
executive 
branch 
and 
encourage awareness on U.S. 
military actions in the Middle 
East.

Music and maturing

W

hat do we do to pass 
time while studying 
alone? The answer 
is almost always music. Music 
is more accessible and portable 
now than ever before, a fact 
made clear by the widespread 
use of headphones and speakers 
in restaurants. I can’t help but 
notice others walking around 
flaunting their AirPods or other 
earpieces. We have access to 
free music platforms through 
apps such as Spotify, Apple 
Music or Google Play Music. 
We have millions of choices 
of what we listen to regarding 
musicians, genre or playlists. 
The artists we listen to have 
a huge impact on our fashion, 
slang and decisions.
As a teen immersed in pop 
culture, I can admit that I 
am 
heavily 
influenced 
by 
the artists I follow daily. Not 
long ago you could find me 
spending hundreds on GOLF le 
FLEUR* by Tyler, the Creator. 
I tune in to this artist’s music 
so frequently, it’s hard not to 
support him and try to replicate 
his style. Yet, he didn’t solely 
influence my fashion sense. I 
discovered over time that Tyler 
is the reason I’m not settling 
for anything less than what I 
deserve concerning my future. 
He preaches individuality and 
loving what you do regardless 
of what others think. Even if 
I’m interested in things others 
deem “lame,” I still do it with 
pride because I find comfort in 
it, such as writing as a form of 
therapy.

Tyler’s line in the track 
“FIND YOUR WINGS”, one of 
his most concise yet melodic 
songs, “Supposed to fly and 
take control cause you’re the 
pilot / You can’t swim, you’re 
gonna drown, the sharks are 
comin’” helped make me realize 
that I shouldn’t put myself in 
a place I don’t belong. This is 
especially relevant to my social 
life and academics, as I choose 
friends 
wisely 
and 
haven’t 
rushed myself in choosing a 
major. Since I discovered Tyler 
in high school, I promised to 
be who I really am, even if it 
strays from the status quo. For 
example, I don’t act “cool” to fit 
in – contradicting my former 
self. Instead, I found a group 
that makes me feel at home 
and comfortable with being my 
eccentric self. Tyler preaches 
this through not only his music, 
but his lifestyle. His art had an 
impact on my life greater than 
just material goods. This is not 
the case for all people impacted 
by artists, however.
Specific 
types 
of 
music, 
mainly due to the lyrics, can 
expose impressionable youth to 
toxic cultures. Lyrics like those 
of rap artists XXXTENTACION 
or 
recently 
deceased 
Juice 
WRLD can popularize the 
abuse of drugs and alcohol. 
These artists can have an 
influence on listeners’ lives to 
the same, or greater, degree as 
parents. Song lyrics can lead 
an 
impressionable 
audience 
to believe it’s “cool” to live 
the way the artists live. Youth 

are still developing and still 
capable of being manipulated 
and molded into what they say 
“inspires” them.
It’s no surprise to hear lyrics 
containing drug references in 
the rap scene. For example, 
artists Juice WRLD and Lil 
Peep 
regularly 
reference 
drugs like Xanax, Percocet 
and marijuana. As consumers 
listen and become obsessed 
with these lyrics, they are 
more likely to experiment with 
drugs. Rap music is not only 
rising in popularity, but it is 
also extremely prevalent in 
teen culture. This means drug 
culture is also present and 
popular among the youth. The 
last thing we need is the youth 
asking themselves “If I want to 
be cool, then I have to smoke 
weed and drink liquor, right?” 
As rap continues to grow 
and the newest hits promote 
toxicity like substance abuse, 
teens will face the decision to 
succumb or abstain.
Nowadays, the influence of 
musicians such as X and Juice 
WRLD play a pivotal role in 
shaping the moral character of 
the youth, whether it is through 
the power of lyrics or the 
overall message encapsulated 
in their art. Each has their 
own culture. Today’s teens and 
future generations, therefore, 
need to find respectable role 
models who can help them 
become who they’d like to be.

Iran conflict reveals underlying foreign 
policy frustrations

Y

ears-long tensions between the United States and Iran peaked three 

weeks ago when the U.S. assassinated the leader of Iran’s military, Major 

General Qassem Soleimani, in the wake of increased conflicts, including 

violent protests outside the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The Iranian general’s death 

disturbed the Middle Eastern and Western world as allies scrambled to prepare for 

a likely counterattack. Iran responded four days later, sending a barrage of missiles 

at two U.S. military bases. The attack was rather minor as there were no deaths 

— though some soldiers were injured. The next day, Iran’s military — allegedly 

mistakenly — shot down a Ukrainian airliner, killing all 176 people on board.

It is important 
for Americans 
to keep things in 
perspective.


2015’s era of bright, side-
swept 
hair 
and 
Tumblr 
edginess is embodied in one 
famous figure: Halsey. Rising 
to 
extreme 
stardom 
with 
the release of her fantastical 
debut album, BADLANDS, she 
became a voice that many angsty 
teenagers clung to. Her music 
created an alternate reality, 
BADLANDS existing as a fake 
universe for teenage fans to get 
lost in. Her distinctive, almost 
warbling vocals have garnered 
both 
praise 
and 
criticism, 
especially since she has become 
more “mainstream.” In 2017, 
her album hopeless fountain 
youth channeled more of the 
radio-hit sound that she had 
avoided earlier in her career. 
Many fans started to lose 
interest, mostly since hopeless 
fountain youth was an album 
that attempted to maintain that 
“alternate universe” aura but 
didn’t have that unique sound 
that many attributed to Halsey. 
With 
her 
2020 
release, 
Manic, Halsey has ditched the 
mystical, imaginative concepts 
for a much more raw and 
grounded album. The songs 
sound hardly like anything 
you could find on her early 
releases. The album is chock 
full of ballads and deep-cuts, 
the majority of songs devoid 
of the heavily electronified 
instrumentals that reigned on 
BADLANDS. In a sense, the 

album is a maturation of the 
singer’s first album which she 
wrote when she was 19. Now 
25, Halsey has had more than 
half a decade of experience in 
the spotlight and the music 
industry in general, all of which 
is evident on Manic. While the 
subject matter and the actual 
sound of each individual song 
shows a lot of growth, the 
album as a whole doesn’t quite 

hit the mark.
Unfortunately, 
the 
album 
falls short through its lack of 
unity. 
Songs 
like 
“Without 
You”, 
(a 
single 
obviously 
written for radio play) and 
“I HATE EVERYBODY” just 
seem so remarkably out of place 
among the songs that actually 
tell a story. The presence of 
these uber-pop, very shallow 
songs automatically discredits 

so much of what was really 
well-done on the record. These 
types of tracks would have 
worked on the singer’s earlier 
work, as the entire feel of those 
albums benefited from some 
bouncy, easy-listening songs. 
Manic’s purpose, from Halsey’s 
own words, is meant to be a 
personal 
record, 
channeling 
the real person behind Halsey: 
Ashley Frangipane. While her 
attempts to do this are clear, 
the 
execution 
isn’t 
exactly 
successful. 
There are snippets of passion 
and 
intentful 
songwriting. 
Highlights 
like 
“Finally//
beautiful 
stranger” 
and 
“929” show a side of her 
that the world hasn’t seen 
before — significantly more 
introspective than her older 
work, these tracks sound like 
Halsey’s personal confessions. 
Since her 2015 album, she 
has been in two high-profile 
relationships, one with rapper 
G-Eazy 
and 
another 
with 
Yungblud. Many of the slower 
songs show the real side of 
these relationships as well as 
their endings. It’s the first time 
Halsey seems to have dealt with 
these topics with a great sense 
of maturity.
An album like this, while 
flawed and a bit all over the 
place, bodes well for Halsey’s 
future 
career. 
Across 
her 
discography, her intellectual 
growth is evident to anyone 
listening. Manic may not be 
Halsey’s apex, but it certainly 
shows a big step in the right 
direction.

Halsey’s deep cuts are a
letdown on new release

CAPITOL RECORDS

GIGI CIULLA
Daily Arts Writer

The year is 2020 and Eminem 
is still hell-bent on retroactively 
tainting his musical legacy 
with garbage records. The last 
couple years have seen tasteless 
lyrics tinged in homophobia 
and sexism, immature lash-
outs against detractors and 
unrelenting negativity directed 
at other rappers and celebrities. 
On his newest record, surprise 
released 
on 
Jan. 
17, 
the 
legendary best-selling rapper is 
once again victimizing himself 
line after unnecessarily edgy 
line. And predictably so.
Music To be Murdered By 
is far more tolerable than his 
offensively unlistenable 2017 
record Revival. Most of the 
instrumentation is a lot more 
palatable. “You Gon’ Learn” is 
the highlight with its jittery 
percussion 
and 
wavering, 
pitched 
background 
vocals. 
“Lock It Up” sounds kind of 
like a 14-year-old’s first trap 
beat cooked up on a pirated 
copy of FL Studio, and it’s 
almost endearing. Royce Da 
5’9” is featured on three tracks, 
which means three guaranteed 
breaths of fresh air in which I 
don’t have to listen to Eminem 
whining.
When it comes down to 
it though, most of the usual 

modern era Marshall Mathers 
missteps are in full effect. I 
did a little chuckle and sigh 
when I saw Ed Sheeran and 
Skylar Grey on the tracklist 
— oh, Eminem, will you ever 
learn? — But I could not stop 
laughing through album opener 
“Premonition 
- 
Intro.” 
If 
someone asked me what would 

be the absolute worst way to 
open a hypothetical Eminem 
surprise album, I would have 
replied with, “An intro track 
where he complains about his 
ratings and attacks his critics.” 
Lo and behold.
Wasting features on mediocre 
tracks is a violation of the hip-

hop honor code, and Eminem 
is in flagrant transgression 
of the law. How does he sleep 
at night after putting hip-hop 
legends like Black Thought and 
Q-Tip on a beat as ear-grating 
as “Yah Yah”? I’m disappointed 
that Busta Rhymes’s iconic ’96 
single “Woo Hah!! Got You All 
In Check” will now forever be 
associated with the awfully 
executed vocal sample on “Yah 
Yah.” But that’s not his worst 
offense on the tracklist.
Eminem’s greatest crime was 
somehow convincing millions 
of people that the speedy-
quick-rappity-rap bullshit from 
the last minute of “Godzilla” is 
remotely enjoyable. How it has 
50 million listens on Spotify 
is 
beyond 
me 
— 
syllables 
per second will never be a 
meaningful metric in assessing 
the quality of a song. It’s a 
shame because the beat has 
contagious concert energy and 
the late Juice WRLD’s hook is 
heat. It would be playlistable 
as hell if Vince Staples was 
rapping over it instead.
Corny writing is a plague that 
puts the album on its deathbed. 
I don’t know where the idea 
came from that good writing 
is 
equivalent 
to 
squeezing 
multiple meanings into a shitty 
metaphor. Hip hop would be a 
pitiful sport if double entendres 
won trophies. I think when 
Eminem says “I’m coming after 
you like the letter V,” he wants 

my mind to be blown when I 
realize he could be referring 
to the order of the letters “U” 
and “V” in the alphabet or the 
titular character from “V For 
Vendetta.” To me, that’s the 
rap game equivalent of sending 
your Tinder match a poem 
where the first letter of each 
line spells out “SEND NUDES.”
This 
“multiple 
interpretations” 
writing style is stale throughout 
the entire album, save for one 
creative 
application 
on 
the 
track “Darkness.” The point-
of-view 
imperceptibly 
shifts 
between Eminem’s own inner 
hysteria before a concert, and 
the perspective of Las Vegas 
massacre 
shooter 
Stephen 
Paddock. The crestfallen piano 
melody is a perfectly moody 
backdrop that lets Eminem’s 
narrative take the spotlight, 
and the hook is Eminem’s 
best in years. Even the “Hello 
darkness, 
my 
old 
friend” 

sample — lifted from Simon 
& Garfunkel’s “The Sound of 
Silence” — makes for a pretty 
smooth motif, despite the line 
being memed to death thanks 
to Arrested Development. The 
track is the closest thing to a 
success Eminem has on the 
whole record, but it’s not quite 
there. It’s just too unsettling 
and off-kilter. The long-winded 
parallel between a nervous 
Eminem and a mass murderer 
of very recent memory leaves a 
bad taste in my mouth, and the 
audio clips of a mass shooting 
are discomforting even in the 
context of the song. The music 
video may end with a call to 
action for gun control, but the 
rest of the song doesn’t add up 
to that message.
Music To Be Murdered By 
doubles down on Eminem’s 
decade-long 
commitment 
to making bad music. His 
childish insistence that he’s 

“murdering” people with his 
“killer” lyrics is down-right 
pathetic. In a cringe-inducing 
Instagram post, Eminem writes 
to his critics, “These bars are 
only meant for the sharpest 
knives in the drawer … For the 
rest of you, please listen more 
closely next time.” Apparently 
if you don’t like Eminem’s new 
music, then this album was a big 
fat roast, and if you couldn’t tell 
that you just got #destroyed, 
then you’re too dumb and you 
just didn’t get it. His obsession 
with getting positive critical 
response to his music is at odds 
with his persistent wailing 
that his critics are unwoke and 
unintelligent. Don’t even get me 
started on Ebro’s embarrassing 
tweet 
comparing 
Eminem’s 
supposed lack of respect to 
being Black. Please just kill me 
already, because Music To Be 
Murdered By doesn’t live up to 
its title.

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

“The Gimmicks” is set against 
the backdrop of the Armenian 
genocide; it follows the journey of 
two inseparable friends — brothers, 
really — who embark on two wildly 
different 
paths. 
One 
brother, 
the reclusive and, frankly, one-
dimensional Ruben, is obsessed 
with righting the wrongs of the 
Turkish denial of the genocide, 
and joins the guerilla-terrorist 
organization 
The 
Armenian 
Secret Army for the Liberation 
of Armenia (ASALA). The other 
brother, the massive, unibrowed 
and personable Avo, leaves for 
America to try to help Ruben before 
he recognizes his toxicity, deciding 
then to pursue a short professional 
wrestling career to try to get back 
to his teenage sweetheart, Mina, 
in Armenia. However, the central 
plot revolves around what happens 
between the years that Avo leaves 
for America in the late ‘70s and 
the 1989 search that Avo’s former 
wrestling manager, Terry Krill, 
embarks on a journey to find Avo 
after losing contact with him in 
1980. It soon becomes apparent 
that no one has heard anything 
of Avo’s whereabouts for years, 
and the novel’s focus is to fill in 
the intervening years of Avo’s life, 
slowly unraveling the truth of what 
happened, why he left and where 
he is now.
Using 
this 
framework, 
McCormick 
crafts 
alluring 
characters, 
paints 
a 
heart-
wrenchingly vivid portrait of 
the scars that history can leave 
and questions the different ways 
we can express our national 
identities. The passages dealing 
with these elements and ideas 
exemplify “The Gimmicks” at its 
most powerful. McCormick deftly 
establishes Avo as a sympathetic 
character, and by placing him at 
the center of an unresolved history, 
McCormick gives the reader the 
fearful anticipation and curiosity 
that Krill and others searching 
for Avo feel. The book gradually 
unravels the enigma surrounding a 
character that the reader becomes 
emotionally invested in, and adds 
excitement to the prospect of the 
tendrils of time frames stretching 
to meet each other, and thus fill 
in the missing history. The truth 
seems painfully just out of reach, 

which endears the reader to the 
characters all the more so. 
In contrast to Avo, Ruben and 
his 
juxtaposition 
against 
his 
brother sow unease in the reader, 
as the truth unravels and the reader 
can be no more than a passive 
spectator to the self-destructive 
vortex of Ruben’s personality and 
radicalism. He reminds the reader 
of a family member who is always 
just out of reach, slowly drifting 
away and hopelessly sabotaging the 
lives of those in close proximity. All 
you can do is watch and shake your 
head. To this capacity, Ruben is 
an effective plot device. But while 
the book bills Ruben as a main 
character in its blurb, Ruben ends 
up being relegated to the sidelines 
as a sinister and abstract force that 
the reader might end up loathing. 
As effectively as McCormick uses 

Ruben as a source of conflict and 
disruption, what results is an 
unlikeable caricature. Later in the 
novel, when McCormick attempts 
to provide insight into Ruben’s 
state of mind, it is too late: His role 
as a toxic influence was solidified 
early on, and whatever kinship Avo 
ever felt toward Ruben becomes 
more elusive and confusing to the 
reader.
In spite of Ruben, though, 
McCormick is still able to deliver 
a somber and poignant character-
focused narrative. However, he 
mismanages the plot resolutions, 
and the unfulfilling conclusions 
bogged this novel down. The 
resolution to Avo’s story arc in 
particular undercut the entire 
narrative that led up to it, mostly 
because there was an absence 
of a resolution. The reader is 

presented the fundamental facts 
and narrative of what happened 
in 
those 
missing 
years, 
but 
McCormick doesn’t explore what 
these truths actually mean, and, 
more importantly, why the reader 
should 
even 
care. 
Ultimately 
the novel ended where it began, 
with all of the damage, harm and 
conflict that was revealed over the 
course of the novel never being 
addressed, or redressed, for that 
matter. 
The journey to reaching the 
truth is rendered cheap, and 
becomes a trivial exercise in 
curiosity; especially telling are 
the conclusions reached by those 
trying to find Avo. For an entire 
book’s worth of earnest searching 
and uprooting of characters, the 
truth doesn’t end up having any 
significant impact, and one begins 
to wonder why such an effort was 
made to skirt around the solution 
to begin with, aside for the sake of 
narrative power.
The 
plot 
ends 
up 
feeling 
unfinished, 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
satisfying closure renders the 400 
pages of buildup moot. Terry Krill, 
whom the reader is supposed to 
project themselves onto as an 
outside party looking for answers, 
ends up in the same place as the 
reader, but somehow with even 
less of a resolution. While this 
can be an effective strategy to 
accentuate a story’s poignancy 
and bittersweetness, Krill seems 
content without the resolution that 
he spent a long and emotionally 
draining 
investigative 
process 
trying to find; this does not sit well 
with the reader. 
With such a powerful buildup, 
“The 
Gimmicks” 
conclusion 
was incredibly confusing on an 
emotional level. This distress I 
felt raised interesting questions, 
though. 
Should 
a 
book 
that 
meditates 
on 
the 
Armenian 
Genocide, extremism, obsession 
and history-denial have a fulfilling 
or 
satisfying 
ending? 
More 
importantly, isn’t the frustration 
and futility of the novel’s resolution 
emblematic of how we can do 
nothing to undo the atrocities of 
the past, aside from continuing 
forward? I will continue to wrestle 
with those questions, and as I do, 
though I am ultimately dissatisfied 
with the novel, I continue to ponder 
the relationships we have with 
history, and if “The Gimmicks” can 
provide insight into the nature of 
those relationships.

Novel set amid Armenian 
genocide cheapens itself

Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle/
skin-care/health product brand 
Goop has long been the target 
of jokes skewering its willful 
inaccessibility (see: jade egg 
lawsuit, shockingly overpriced 
products and most recently, this 
candle debacle). The newest 
Goop project, a six-episode 
docuseries on Netflix continues 
the company’s failed attempts 
to induct consumers into the 
carefully manicured, pseudo-
spiritual brand of capitalism.
“The 
Goop 
Lab” 
follows 
the titular brand’s employees 
jet-setting across the globe 
to try the latest in alternative 
medicines 
and 
treatments. 
Intercut 
with 
footage 
of 
these firsthand experiences, 
Paltrow 
and 
Goop’s 
Chief 
Content Officer, Elise Loehnen, 
interview 
hand-selected 
experts on each episode’s main 
theme. Testimonials of non-
Goop affiliated people also 
attempt 
to 
lend 
credibility 
to the methods using their 
personal accounts of unbridled 
success.
Topics 
range 
from 
the 
psychotherapeutic 
benefits 

of magic mushrooms to the 
quest to bring female pleasure 
into the mainstream to the 
healing power of cold water 
and breathing. That last one 
was 
particularly 
Goop-y. 
Apparently, 
snowga 
— 
the 
practice of doing yoga in the 
snow while wearing only a 
swimsuit — might be the next 
trend to sweep the nation.

On the surface, “The Goop 
Lab” doesn’t seem to have bad 
intentions. A genuine interest 
in bringing unconventional yet 
helpful treatment techniques 
into 
Western 
medicine 
is 
not 
inherently 
negative. 
Unfortunately, 
for 
Goop, 
authenticity does not appear 
to be a pressing concern. Goop 

itself does not advertise any 
of its own products or directly 
attempt to profit from selling 
the show’s featured methods 
to consumers. However, the 
underlying 
assumption 
that 
Goop is in any way affiliated 
with the success of alternative 
medicine calls the program’s 
integrity into question.
While 
Goop 
definitely 
pats itself on the back for 
showcasing how open-minded 
it is as a company, ironically, 
the 
emphasis 
on 
showing 
Goop 
employees 
trying 
hallucinogenic mushroom tea 
or taking part in genital show-
and-tell sessions become part 
of what makes “The Goop 
Lab” questionable. In order 
to show how effective these 
‘East-meets-West’ 
treatments 
are, 
the 
interviewees 
must 
speak at length about personal 
traumas 
or 
obstacles 
they 
hope the techniques can help 
them overcome. By equating 
complete recovery of mental 
and 
physical 
illnesses 
to 
practices not entirely accepted 
by modern science, “The Goop 
Lab” uses these testimonials as 
rhetorical devices rather than 
truly sensitive issues.

NETFLIX

The internet is a vast place. 
Not only are there fun memes 
and puppy videos to grace our 
feeds every morning, there is 
the entire dark web, too.
I don’t know much about the 
latter — I am a theater major 
who vehemently resents social 
media, 
instant 
messaging 
and 
ad-polluted 
shopping 
sites. Veering off the beaten 
path has never been on my 
radar, but playwright Javaad 
Alipoor is an encyclopedia of 
knowledge on how the internet 
is undermining democracy and 
instantaneously reshaping the 
world.
The central storyline in 
Alipoor’s 
new 
play, 
“The 
Believers Are But Brothers,” 
follows 
two 
Muslim 
men 
residing in different parts of 
England and their experience 
of getting recruited by ISIS. 
I’ve 
found 
that 
trying 
to 
explain the complexities of 
their recruitment gives away 
the show and is far better 
depicted by Alipoor, so my best 
bet is just to implore you to 
go see it at the Arthur Miller 
Theater.
The show dumped a ton 
of information related to the 
world of the dark web on 
the viewer without slowing 
down to hold anyone’s hand, 
so it’s no surprise that “The 
Believers are but Brothers” 
was rewarded with the largest 
retention of people for any 
Q&A I have seen at my four 
years at the University.
While I sat in the theater, I 
could not shake the feeling that 
what Alipoor was doing was 
dangerous. He spoke so much 
truth about ISIS’ successful 
recruitment of young Muslims 
in the Western world while 
simultaneously 
depicting 
a 

young, white supremacist who 
never 
leaves 
his 
computer 
screen. In doing so, he allowed 
the audience to realize how 
much damage comes from 
each side. Spoiler: both do an 
astounding amount of rallying 
for their respective causes 
online.
Therefore, as Alipoor dished 
out fact after fact in a state that 
swung red in the last election, 
I was frightened that maybe 
someone who did not agree 
with him could be inspired to 
protest or even incite violence.
Maybe that’s part of the 
show. If we are constantly 
attached to these devices and 
mediums of communication 
that have the potential to ensue 
such violence and hate, what 
is the difference? According 
to this show, the alt-right is 
far more advanced in digital 
manipulation 
that 
prompts 
the banding together of white 
supremacy 
groups,online 
hate speech and controlling 
elections. The left is far behind 
in the advancement of that sort 
of asset, if you can call it that. 
During the Q&A, American 
culture 
professor 
Lisa 
Nakamura said she believes the 
left underestimates the value 
of spectacle online that the alt-
right has come to master. 
I 
don’t 
think 
we 
are 
supposed to be overstimulated 
this much. There is a part in 
the show near the end where 
Alipoor is playing Call of Duty 
while the whole rest of the 
stage is lit up in all sorts of 
media for a couple of minutes. 
I couldn’t help thinking about 
how monstrous it all is. 
Scenes 
jumped 
between 
direct address to the audience, 
Skype, 
Youtube 
and 
even 
WhatsApp. In each medium, 
the audience acted as an avid 
participant. At the beginning, 
Alipoor shared memes with us 
that any person under 30 would 
recognize like Pepe the Frog or 

Doge. By the conclusion of the 
play, however, these memes 
were boiled down to the basic 
ideologies that fuel the world’s 
most violent groups, like white 
supremacists and ISIS.
Memes to terrorism is a 
big jump, I know. I still have 
a plethora of questions that I 
want answered, but just like 
going down the internet rabbit 
hole, finding answers leads to 
more questions. Alipoor’s play 
feels a bit like going down the 
internet rabbit hole. At times, 
this made it hard to follow 
what train of thought he was 
going down.
The panel afterwards was led 
by Alipoor, Nakamura (known 
for her gender videogame class) 
and Alexandra Stern (author 
of “Proud Boys and the White 
Ethnostate: 
How 
the 
Alt-
Right is warping the American 
Imagination”) and School of 
Information professor Clifford 
Lampe. All four had fascinating 
insights into how the internet 
is shaping humanity. 
When asked if we are just 
looking too closely at the 
internet by blaming it for the 
evils of the world, the panel 
acknowledged the sentiment, 
but Alipoor restated that there 
are worlds being destroyed 
because of the technology. 
“There is a way that we 
as humans, for better or for 
worse, are able to communicate 
that we haven’t even begun 
to 
scratch 
the 
surface 
of 
yet,”Alipoor said.
It’s exciting and frightening 
to think of what happens 
past the internet. We have 
the history of mankind at 
our fingertips, the ability to 
overthrow 
governments 
or 
create blackweb armies that 
can be just a few clicks away, 
so what happens next? 
Now, if you’ll excuse me, 
I’m going to go scroll through 
Facebook to shake off all this 
internet anxiety.

Isaiah Livers and the fate of the Michigan men’s basketball team

 Isaiah Livers shouldn’t have 
been in the game. In fact, for over 
half of it, he wasn’t. 
 But despite suffering anoth-
er injury in the second half, the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
knew who it needed on the floor.
 The Wolverines were down by 
two points to Illinois with half a 
second and one chance, maybe, 
to pry a victory away from the 
Illini (15-5 overall, 7-2 Big Ten). A 
victory they desperately needed 
for both their record and con-
fidence. After all, this was sup-
posed to be the one.
 Livers was back. After initially 
suffering a groin injury on Dec. 
21 against Presbyterian, Livers 
missed six games and the re-
maining Wolverines lost four of 
those. Simply put, they were in 
freefall, and Livers was to be the 
massive inflatable mattress to 
catch their fall. 
 But freshman wing Franz Wag-
ner fumbled the pass. The clock 
drained out allowing the red 
LED lights to flash and obnox-
ious buzzer to sound and signal 
another bruising loss for Michi-
gan (11-8, 2-6), 64-62.
 Frustrated, saddened and per-
haps a bit defeated, sophomore 
guard David DeJulius then saun-
tered over to Livers and spoke a 
few words to him that were rat-
tling around his mind all game.
 “Thank you,” DeJulius said to 
Livers. “We appreciate you. 
We’re gonna have your back 
because we know you’re 
gonna have ours.”
 To the fans, Liv-
ers’ injury per-
haps just rep-
resents 
a 

broken 
s e a -

son. To the team, his injury rep-
resents a broken spirit.
 Livers is a core component of 
this basketball team and is often 
pegged as perpetually placing 
the team’s needs and desires be-
fore his own. After all, Livers is 
the guy who asked coach Juwan 
Howard to come back into the 
game to make the last-second in-
bounds pass after reinjuring his 
groin. He just wants to win.
 Perhaps that’s what got DeJu-
lius so emotional.
 “It just took the air out of us,” 
DeJulius said, holding back tears. 
“When you know got somebody 
who care about the game, and 
he’s a better person than he is a 
basketball player, to see him go 
down again is unfortunate.”
 The circumstances of Livers’ 
second injury make sense the 
more you think about it. Did the 
injury occur during a freak in-
stance where Livers was away 
from the action?
 Of course not.
 Early in the second half, Liv-
ers caught the ball in transi-
tion and rose for a monstrous 
dunk. The noise level grew 
in anticipation of the fero-
cious slam, but it never came. 
Livers was fouled by Illinois 
guard Da’Monte Williams 
and landed awkwardly.
 Running away from 
the 
basket, 

L i v e r s 

grabbed his left groin area to an 
audible groan from the crowd. 
The savior was bruised.
 It didn’t help that Livers was 
also playing great basketball. 
Aside from just being this amor-
phous force that could come 
back and resuscitate a strug-
gling offense, Livers entered 
the game and played valuable 
minutes, ending the game with a 
team-leading plus-minus rating 
of three.
 While Livers — along with the 
rest of the team — started the first 
half a bit slow, he really showed 
what he brings to the program in 
the second.
 The junior secured his fifth re-
bound early, shoring up defense 
in the post and bringing ener-
gy to the boards. Then, with 17 
minutes left to play, he caught 
the ball from senior guard Zavier 
Simpson, elevated and buried a 

3-pointer to 

t h u n -

der-

ous applause from Cris-
ler Center. He would 
finish 
with 
seven 

points and five boards.
 The forward was back, 
and he was cooking. 
The shot was a momen-
tum play, giving Michigan 
its first lead since early in 
the first half.
 Then, disaster struck.
 “When he went 
down, all of us were in 
tears for the guy,” De-
Julius said. “We know 
how bad he wants to be 
out there for his broth-
ers. That was tough for 
us to see that and then go 
out there and compete still.”
 Now with Livers’ timetable for 
return unclear, the rest of the 
team has to stare down the mon-
umental task of winning basket-
ball game without No. 2. A task 
they’ve faced — and failed atww 
— before. On top of that, they 
have to elevate their team-
mate 
who’s 
undoubtedly 

frustrated with his situation.
 “Because you worry about 
how he doin mentally,” De-
Julius said. “If we take a 
loss without him, that’s it, 
but I just want my brother 
to be in a position where 
he’s happy and in a com-
fortable place, 

and I know he’s in a dark place 

right now, and it’s just our job 

to pick him up.”

 With the support of his 

teammates and coach-
ing staff, Livers will 
undoubtedly make as 
speedy a recovery as 
possible, hoping that 
the team doesn’t 
continue to bleed 
out while he’s gone.
 Because if they do, 
the next time the 
name Isaiah Livers 
is announced to roar-
ing applause at Cris-
ler Center, the games 

might start to matter 

less and less.

M

aybe some who pulled 
up to the Lincoln 
High School parking 
lot that night knew what they 
were getting into, but I sure did 
not.
I was there — like most — to 
see Emoni Bates. Bates is the 
top prospect 
in the 2022 
recruiting 
class, accord-
ing to, well, 
everyone. 
Most recruit-
ing analysts, 
including 
ESPN’s Paul 
Biancardi, 
tab Bates as 
the best prep 
player in the nation, regardless 
of class. As a freshman, Bates 
averaged over 28 points and 10 
rebounds and led Lincoln to 
the State Title. His face subse-
quently plastered Sports Illus-
trated with the headline “Magic, 
Michael, LeBron, … Emoni?”
He was 15 at the time.
In August, an ESPN article 
compiling the opinions of over 
a dozen prep basketball experts 
ranked Bates, now 15, tied for 
the third best prospect since 
LeBron — behind Kevin Durant 
and Greg Oden, and tied with 
Derrick Rose.
The article quotes an anony-
mous scout: “He has a chance to 
be ahead of LeBron (James). I’ve 
never seen a better freshman.”
I had not parked myself on 
those rigid bleachers with any 
intention to be an arbiter of his 
legitimacy. That ship has long 
sailed. I just wanted to see it.
And yet, perhaps cynically, 
my default expectation was 
disappointment. In this Hoop 
Mixtape-ified era, when every 
highlight video is edited and 
flawlessly quaffed to only dis-
play the good, hype can be a 
dangerous drug. There’s a rea-
son LeBron remains the only 
player of this ilk to truly live up 

to the hype; it’s really hard. 
Then, as anyone with any 
mild interest in the sport must 
do, I watched him play basket-
ball. I watched him rise from 
25-plus feet; I watched him 
drive the lane, knifing through 
four flailing help defenders; I 
watched him slam alley-oops 
and toss no-look passes; I 
watched him handle the ball 
with dizzying speed and yoyo-
like control. And let me tell you: 
There’s not an ounce of hyper-
bole in these anonymous quotes 
and over-filtered Overtime 
videos.
His shot is aesthetically the 
closest thing anyone’s ever come 
to recreating that of Durant. In 
warmups, he widens his stride, 
loads his lanky 
arms and shoots 
with a silky 
smooth release. 
Few even bother 
to touch rim. 
Bates — at 6-foot-
9 — can get that 
same shot with 
the same motion 
off over anyone. 
But then the 
game starts, and 
the true wonders 
of his game begin to come to life. 
Off the tip, Bates grabs the ball, 
sprints down the court with 
haste, shakes his defender with 
a few crossovers and takes a 
long 3-pointer. It clanks rim.
Instead of sulking or relaxing 
on defense, he keeps that mania-
cal energy all game. There are 
no questions about his “motor” 
or concerns that he “drifts” or 
other euphemisms to express 
disinterest. He is here. And he 
wants to snatch your soul.
He first hits one 3-pointer. 
Then another. Then he rises for 
an alley-oop dunk and unleash-
es a scream upon landing. Every 
trip down the court is a mini-
event. Will he dribble straight 
into a pull-up? Will he try to 
make his defender fall? Will he 

put his head down and get to 
the rim?
Then, as he dances around 
the arc, controlling his defend-
er’s ankles like a puppeteer, 
Bates steps back and drains 
another three. I can’t help but 
stand up. It was like a church-
goer compelled from his seat, 
not by free will, but by the 
spiritual force of some divine 
entity. He had 19 points after the 
first quarter. Nobody seemed 
surprised. Everyone (opposing 
players and fans aside) was rol-
licking in joy. 
It was purely human, instinc-
tive shock. A 16-year-old simply 
should not be that good at bas-
ketball. He goes on to score 40 
points of his team’s 67. You get 
the feeling he 
could’ve scored 
all 67 if he 
wanted.
Rumors, as 
they do, are 
flying about 
Bates’ future. 
Some have 
entertained the 
possibility that 
he reclassifies 
to the 2021 class 
to presumably 
play at Michigan State for a year. 
The thinking, simply, is that 
it’s unimaginable this kid will 
want to play four years of high 
school basketball. It’s easy to see 
why. It’s also an open secret that 
when they negotiate a new Col-
lective Bargaining Agreement, 
the NBA will end the “one-and-
done” rule, perhaps in time for 
Bates to turn professional right 
away. 
The future may be uncertain. 
But the present is undeniable.
If you, like me, are late to the 
party: The next great basketball 
player just happens to live in 
Ypsilanti. Go see him play.

The Emoni experience

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Three good things: Honoring Chip

Three good things.
It’s the motto Chip Hills used 
while he was living through 
pancreatic cancer. It’s the motto 
he wrote so much about in his 
letter to the Michigan women’s 
gymnastics team. It’s the motto 
the team has come to live by.
Chip Hills was the dad of 
former Michigan gymnast Cailee 
Hills. In 2015, the Wolverines 
began the Flip for Chip meet. A 
way to honor Chip and his love for 
Michigan gymnastics, but also to 
remind people that sometimes it’s 
about more than just gymnastics.
“I think it’s just awesome to 
come out here and just know that 
our gymnastics can reach so many 
different people,” freshman Sierra 
Brooks said. “And there’s always 
bigger things going on in people’s 
lives than what it seems like.”
Three good things was Chip’s 
motto not only through his cancer 
treatment, but also throughout 
life. It was customary for the 
Hillsfamily to sit down at dinner 
and each say three good things 
that happened in their day. And 
the motto extended far beyond the 
Hill’s family dinner table.
“Honestly, it’s just something 
that we say in the gym all the 
time, and it can apply to so many 
different circumstances,” Brooks 
said. “It just tells us to put our 
struggles in perspective and get 

through the hard things even 
when it doesn’t seem like it. “
While there were mutliple 
positives 
resulting 
from 
the 
Wolverines’ Friday night meet 
against 
Rutgers, 
197.300 
to 
192.950, the Daily breaks down 
three that stood out.
Sophomore Natalie Wojcik’s 
beam routine
The crowd in Crisler Center 
erupted as Natalie Wojcik flipped 
off the beam, sticking the landing 
of her dismount. She posted a 
score of 9.950, the highest of the 
night. Wojcik was the NCAA 
Champion on beam last year, and 
despite a bit of a slower start this 
year, she broke through the wall 
on Friday.
“She really came out tonight 
and showed what she’s capable of 
doing,” Michigan coach Bev Plocki 
said. “Hopefully, this will give her 
more confidence to continue to 
perform at this level.”
Freshman Sierra Brooks’ all-
around performance
Despite her young age, Brooks 
has continued to dominate each 
event, at every meet. Last week, 
she was named the Big Ten 
Freshman of the Week. On Friday 
night, she continued to put that 
stellar reputation to the test. She 
competed all-around — which 
is a feat in itself for a freshman. 
Staying consistent through all four 
events, she posted scores all above 
9.800, with a 9.900 on beam. 
“Overall I’m pretty happy with 

my performance,” Brooks said. 
“It just comes down to fixing the 
small things, working on things 
for the future, but cohesively I’m 
just pretty happy with how I did.”
Team competition
As the Wolverines continue 
the high-level competition they’re 
known for, it could be hard to 
improve, but Michigan showed 
it was possible on Friday night 
by increasing their team score by 
six-tenths of a point from their 
recent meet against Illinois. Such 
improvement is due to their focus 
to detail.
“I think this meet went really 
well,” said Wojcik. “We’ve been 
working on improving things 
week to week and I think we’re 
starting to really get there.”
On Thursday, the day before 
the meet, the Wolverines’ entire 
focus was on detail. In a floor drill 
they call shoot-out, the focus was 
on making eye contact with the 
audience during a floor routine. 
For Michigan its about more 
than the skills, its about the 
performance, the show and the 
crowd. This fine attention to 
detail continues to add to the 
Wolverines’ point total. And part 
of focusing on the audience means 
remembering people like Chip.
In an opening video, the 
Wolverines 
highlighted 
the 
importance of Friday’s meet. 
“This time we compete to honor 
someone. ... This time we flip for 
Chip.”

The expectations for the 
Wolverines entering Sunday’s 
game against Rutgers weren’t 
all that high. 
The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team (13-6 overall, 
4-4 Big Ten) had lost three 
of its last four contests, and 
Sunday was its first full game 
without senior forward Kayla 
Robbins, who tore her ACL a 
week prior. Even more, it was 
going up against a Rutgers team 
(15-4, 5-3) that sat just outside 
the top 25. 
Yet the Wolverines seemed 
unfazed 
— 
even 
without 
Robbins. They hit tough shots. 
They forced turnovers. And 
they dealt the Scarlet Knights 
their fourth loss, burying them, 
71-57.
“We know and understand 
that 
nobody 
is 
gonna 
be 
Kayla Robbins. Nobody in the 
country can be Kayla Robbins,” 
sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon said. “We’re not gonna 
try to be. But somebody needs 
to take on the little things 
she did. One person can get a 
couple more rebounds, get a 
couple more points, get a couple 
more steals.”
From 
the 
start, 
the 
Wolverines’ offense did just 
that, 
captained 
by 
senior 
guard Akienreh Johnson. She 
notched seven points and two 
rebounds in the first quarter 
alone, leading Michigan to a 
20-13 lead entering the second 
quarter. Johnson finished the 
first half with 15 points and 
three rebounds. 
On the other end, Rutgers’ 
offense 
was 
a 
disaster. 
A 
backcourt violation just three 
seconds after the opening tip 
set the tone for the Scarlet 
Knights, who turned the ball 
over an astounding 15 times in 
the first half alone. 
On top of Rutgers’ sloppy 
play, a good chunk of its 
turnovers came thanks to a 
new-look 2-3 zone from the 
Wolverines defense. Featuring 

a three-big lineup — with 
Hillmon, junior forward Hailey 
Brown and freshman center 
Izabel Varejão all down low 
— the zone caught the Scarlet 
Knights by surprise and forced 
them into errors.
“We wanted to get the ball 
out of their ball handlers’ hands, 
something that 
a lot of teams 
do 
to 
us,” 
Hillmon 
said. 
“We wanted to 
make them as 
uncomfortable 
as possible and 
make 
other 
people 
make 
decisions. 
Their two ball 
handlers create 
a lot for themselves as well 
as others. We were really just 
trying to make somebody else 
take the shots and handle the 
ball the way that teams try to 
pressure us into doing.”
Visibly frustrated, Rutgers’ 
defense 
committed 
a large 
number of fouls and opened the 
door for more Wolverines to step 
up. Sophomore guard Amy Dilk 
did just that, sinking all five of 
her first-half free throws. She 
remained consistent on offense 
throughout the game, dishing 
the ball to her teammates for a 
respectable five assists.
As the game wore on, the 
Scarlet Knights buried their 
own 
comeback 
hopes 
with 
repeated errors. Though they 
cleaned up the turnovers — 
they committed just two in the 
second half — they couldn’t 
make any of the shots needed 
to make a comeback, shooting a 
poor 36.1 percent in the second 
half. They were even worse on 
free throws, going an abysmal 
5-for-13 from the line in the 
second half. 
Meanwhile, 
Michigan’s 
offense 
continued 
to 
roll. 
Spurred by her electric first 
half, Johnson added another 
nine points on a perfect 4-of-
4 shooting in the second half. 
She finished with 11 rebounds 
and a career-high 24 points — 

the first double-double of her 
career. Hillmon also notched a 
double-double, finishing with 
20 points and 12 rebounds. 
“I think (Johnson) played 
her heart out,” Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico said. “I 
thought she had energy to the 
ball, I thought she had a motor 
to the ball, she 
was everywhere. 
I didn’t realize 
how 
much 
she 
scored 
offensively 
but I knew she 
rebounded 
the 
heck out of the 
ball. She’s kind of 
letting the game 
come to her, she’s 
not pressing, and 
she’s really playing with a lot of 
confidence right now.”
The Wolverines entered this 
game with a lot of question 
marks. They had already been 
struggling 
against 
quality 
teams before Robbins’ injury.
The 
season 
isn’t 
over, 
and questions still remain. 
But 
Michigan 
showed 
on 
Sunday that, despite its recent 
struggles, it can still compete 
with the Big Ten’s best teams 
— even without Kayla Robbins.

When senior forward Kayla 
Robbins went down with a season-
ending ACL injury last week, it was 
clear who the Michigan women’s 
basketball team needed to step up 
— Akienreh Johnson.
The senior guard came into 
the season expected to be what 
Robbins 
was 
— 
the 
scoring 
compliment to sophomore forward 
Naz Hillmon, the player that 
opened up the inside for Hillmon 
and, when Hillmon had an off 
night, the leader that carried the 
Wolverines to a victory.
In Sunday’s 71-57 victory over 
Rutgers, Johnson was all of those 
things for Michigan and more. 
She scored a career-high 24 points 
with 11 rebounds, her first ever 
double-double. No matter what the 
Scarlet Knights tried, she breezed 
through their defense.
“You don’t have to run a play for 
her, but she’s going to go get the 
offensive rebound or she’s going 
to make the right read, the right 
cut, the right slash to get the ball,” 
Hillmon said. “Like (Johnson) said, 
the ball finds energy, and I think 
(Johnson) does a really good job of 
that and I think coach (Kim Barnes 
Arico) knows that. That’s why she 

puts her on the opposite side, so she 
can slash, she can cut.”
Even after a couple of missed 
layups under the rim to start the 
game, Johnson nailed the team’s 
first field goal after slipping 
through the defense and catching 
an inbound pass, immediately 
going up for the shot.
It was the start of a big night for 
Johnson, giving her the confidence 
and energy to continue to make 
those slashes and cuts Robbins 
normally would.
“I just get the ball and like I 
said with my steals, defensive 
rebounds, offensive rebounds and 
once I get those, I start feeling my 
shots,” Johnson said. “We didn’t 
really change anything for me, 
but I think my teammates started 
to look for me more that I started 
scoring more.”
Atop the 3-point arc late in 
the first quarter, Johnson stared 
down a defense that left her alone. 
She made a motion towards the 
basket as if to shoot, and, when the 
defense didn’t move, she accepted 
their dare.
“In practice, I’ve been working 
a lot on my outside threat and 
slashing in the midpoint and 
working on my threes,” Johnson 
said. “So when I caught the ball, 
nobody came to me, and I gave 

them a second, nobody came to 
me again. I was like well, any 
basketball player in the world 
will shoot this shot, and if I miss 
it (Hillmon) and (junior forward 
Hailey Brown) are down there to 
get the rebounds, so I just shot it 
and it went in.”
That 3-pointer set the stage for 
a very different look in the third 
quarter, when Rutgers’ defense 
was suffocating, and it seemed 
like maybe, just maybe, the game 
wasn’t over. Barely getting the 
ball out of the corner, three quick 
passes traveled the entire front 
court in a fraction of a second, 
where Johnson waited. The result, 
a quick 3-pointer, showed the 
Scarlet Knights the game was, in 
fact, over.
And, 
in 
the 
first 
quarter, 
Johnson turned the tables in a 
completely different way.
The game was still tight and 
neither team had hit its stride 
offensively, and Johnson sparked 
a huge momentum boost for the 
Wolverines. After junior forward 
Hailey Brown hit a three to take 
their first lead of the game, Rutgers 
came down looking for an answer.
Johnson, though, had other 
ideas. Intercepting a pass and 
running down the court on a fast 
break, side-by-side with sophomore 
guard Amy Dilk, Johnson fed Dilk 
in behind the defense, who fought 
through contact for the layup and 
an and-one.
Déjà vu struck Rutgers ten 
minutes later when Johnson did 
the exact same thing — only this 
time, she took the layup and the 
and-one herself.
Her defense fed her offense, 
again.
“I think a couple years ago, 
when she first came back (from 
injury), she was able to defend, 
and then she came back and she 
was moving without the ball so 
exceptionally well,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Then she was rebounding. 
Then she was scoring.
“Now as a senior, I think she has 
put all of those things together, and 
has been really healthy and playing 
with a lot of confidence, and her 
mental part of the game has been 
at the highest level it’s ever been.”

A different perspective for volunteer assistant coach Matt Hunwick

When the second intermission 
at the Great Lakes Invitational 
ended, 
the 
coaches 
walked 
across the ice and to their places 
behind the bench.
But 
there 
was 
something 
different about the sight of them, 
gripping along the glass as they 
trotted. There was a new face, 
or at least a new face in that role 
and that place.
Matt 
Hunwick, 
a 
former 
Michigan hockey captain who 
was hired as a volunteer assistant 
specializing in defensemen this 
year, came out alongside the 
regular coaching lineup.
It was the first time all year 
he had coached from behind 
the bench. Normally, Wolverine 
coaches 
Kris 
Mayotte, 
Bill 
Muckalt 
and 
Mel 
Pearson 
occupied that space, while he 
would watch from the press box 
level — floors above. But at Little 
Caesars Arena, for one period, he 
stood behind the players.
And he didn’t like it. 
Or at least, that’s what he 
initially thought after his first 
experience there.
“I thought I preferred being up 
top versus that first experience,” 
Hunwick said Saturday, after a 
4-1 exhibition loss for Michigan. 
“But tonight, I really did enjoy 
being on the bench. I think it 
was good. I liked, you know, that 
I can talk to players and kind of 
read the game from a different 
perspective being close.”
Up top, it was easier for him 
to see systematic things — like 
forechecks, opposing game plans, 
different faceoffs. Sitting behind 
the bench offers an angle where 
those aspects are hard to see. 
Players standing up — impeding 
a coach’s vision. Bending over 
necks to watch a play. Up top he 
could see it all.
Down on the bench, however, 
his perspective changes — in 
more ways than just vision. 
He now had a direct line of 
communication, a read for a 

game similar to a player’s — a 
view he was used to. It was a 
better feel for him.
***
With Muckalt and Mayotte 
traveling for recruiting, Pearson 
turned to Hunwick to fill their 
spots on the bench against the 
U.S. National Team Development 
Program (NTDP).
It wasn’t the first time Pearson 
turned to Hunwick with a role 
in mind. At the end of summer, 
after it became clear that a neck 
injury would keep Hunwick 
from playing in the NHL this 
season, Pearson brought up the 
idea of coming back to Michigan. 
Hunwick had done it many times 
before, in the summertime, just 
looking to work out or skate 
around. He loved his time in Ann 
Arbor and liked to stay around 
the program.
But 
this 
time, 
Pearson 
proposed, he should come back 

as a coach.
“I never really envisioned 
anything in a formal capacity,” 
Hunwick said.
But Pearson offered, and he 
considered.
When Mayotte was hired as 
the penalty kill and goaltender 
specialist 
mid-August, 
Steve 
Shield’s volunteer role as a 
goaltending 
coach 
become 
repetitive. So the team phased 
him into a player development 
role, leaving the volunteer role 
vacant.
Pearson wanted someone who 
could coach defensemen. Had 
Hunwick’s neck injury allowed 
him to play the 2019-2020 season 
in the NHL, Pearson would have 
had to find another defensemen 
to fill that role.
“It was kind of hinged on 
my ability to play this season 
and if I was going to go back to 
Buffalo.” Hunwick said. “And 

unfortunately (or) fortunately, 
however we want to look at it, 
my neck didn’t get better. So I’m 
here.
“This is a great kind of 
transition, out of playing but 
still, you know, still involved in 
the game daily and on the ice, 
just not quite as intense as it was 
maybe a year ago. 
Hunwick was only a few 
months removed from being 
a professional player with the 
possibility of returning to the 
ice — the Buffalo Sabers had 
placed him on injured reserve. 
He was 12 years removed from 
being a Michigan player — a 
four-year skater who captained 
the team his senior year. And he 
was 16 years removed from being 
a USNTDP player — a drafted 
prospect excited to face the 
Wolverines.
While he had never coached 
formally, former Michigan coach 

Red Berenson asked him to be an 
instructor at his summer camps 
multiple times — in addition to 
having helped out at USA and 
USNTDP hockey schools.
Through his experiences on 
all levels, and his recency of 
playing, he had a perspective of 
the game the other players or 
coaches might not have — the 
players especially.
“I 
certainly 
(am 
able 
to 
relate to them),” Hunwick said. 
“There’s a million things going 
on with kids that move away 
from home for the first time. So 
knowing that experience and 
having lived it, I think it helps 
me kind of relate and understand 
what they’re going through.
“Some stuff, you know, I’ve 
had a good idea of and maybe 
even the coaches haven’t had 
exposure to it just because the 
NHL game the pro game has 
changed. So just being able to 

bring those here to these guys.”
His players will ask him all 
sorts of questions. Sometimes 
about the speed and style of 
the game at the next level. 
Sometimes about specifics in a 
game. And it’s easier to answer 
when he’s right behind them, 
standing by their side during a 
match.
“They’ll ask specific questions, 
different plays, how you want to 
do stuff,” Hunwick said. “And if 
I see stuff, I try and point it out 
right away.”
Coaching has been an aspect 
of hockey that Hunwick found to 
be a joy. 
“I was excited just to be able 
to come back and give back,” he 
said.
And he’s given plenty back. 
Sharing 
his 
knowledge 
and 
experience with the players and 
watching them grow has been 
the biggest thing for him. The 
steady improvement in whatever 
area he could help in has been 
fun for him to watch.
***
He’s pondered if he wants to 
continue the experience or not. 
Regardless, he thought learning 
the ins-and-outs of the job were 
necessary to do so — therefore 
experiencing every aspect. He 
wants to make an informed 
decision, and coaching would 
require 
getting 
behind 
the 
bench at some point, so he used 
Saturday’s USNTDP game as an 
opportunity to do so.
From up top, things seem 
easier.
“You guys probably think 
you can go out there and do it,” 
Hunwick said. “It looks simple. 
But speed picks up as you get 
close to the game and being 
on the bench and being able to 
handle the bench, the pairs, and 
making sure your guys do all the 
things, that’s what it’s all about.”
So he took his place next to 
Pearson, with a different but 
familiar perspective.
“That’s what I did for all the 
years growing up, just a couple 
feet behind where I used to sit.”

Wolverines fall, 4-1, to USNTDP in exhibition

Staying focused in a competition 
that has no stakes is often 
difficult. It’s hard to hold yourself 
accountable from start to finish 
when you know there will be no 
repercussions.
And Saturday night at Yost 
Ice Arena, that seemed to be a 
key factor as a previously red-
hot Michigan hockey team fell, 
4-1, in an exhibition against the 
U.S. National Team Development 
Program (NTDP) U18 team.
“I think from start to finish 
we didn’t play how we need to,” 
freshman forward Johnny Beecher 
said. “We came out pretty slow, I 
don’t think the guys were into the 
game as much as we needed to be. 
To be honest, it looked like we did 
two months ago. It’s unacceptable, 
we need a good week of practice 
this week to get ready for Ohio 
State.”
It was a game in which both 
sides played effortlessly. Only that 
one side made things look easy 
while the other didn’t fully commit. 
The contest counted for points in 
the USHL — the league the NTDP 
plays in — while it meant nothing 
to the Wolverines. For Michigan, 
that turned out to be a recipe for 
disaster.
That disparity in motivation 
is something volunteer assistant 
coach Matt Hunwick can relate to. 
Hunwick played for the NTDP and 
before a four-year playing career 
at Michigan, so he has been on 
both sides of an affair like tonight. 
Such a track record forms a unique 
perspective.
“As a player at USA, you are so 
excited to play in that game against 
Michigan, against any college team 
really,” Hunwick said. “And then 
you get to Michigan, that’s a little 
bit different because you’ve already 
done it. You’re on the other side. 
Maybe the juice isn’t quite as much 
as it would be for the USA kids, but 
you can see how much scale and 
speed, and how hard they played.”
The NTDP got called for 
interference 
less 
than 
three 
minutes into the game, giving 
the Wolverines’ power play an 
opportunity to display the growth 
it has made throughout this season. 

But instead, quite the opposite 
happened for Michigan (10-11-3 
overall).
Soon after the ensuing faceoff, 
freshman defenseman Cam York 
lost possession in the offensive 
zone, and that turnover proved 
to be deadly. Forward Thomas 
Bordeleau 
immediately 
skated 
diagonally across the ice, while 
forward Landon Slaggert joined 
the rush. 
Sophomore defenseman Nick 
Blankenburg tried to stop the two-
on-one, but came up short. At the 
last second, Bordeleau sent the 
puck to Slaggert who then sent it 
through sophomore goaltender 
Strauss Mann from the right 
side for the first goal of the night. 
Such a play was uncharacteristic 
of the defense, which has yet to 
give up a shorthanded goal in a 
normal game. The remainder 
of that opening power play was 
unsuccessful for the Wolverines.
“They were ready to play and 
we weren’t,” senior forward Nick 
Pastujov said. “I think that was 
apparent from the start. Giving up 
a shorthanded goal and then just 
the flow of the game, we obviously 
weren’t as invested and they were. 
Showed up in the score.”
Michigan’s defense struggled 
to steal the puck early on. The 
NTDP maintained possession well 
in the opening period and moved 
it around quickly. The effort did 
damage to the Wolverines.
“Their team’s good,” Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson said. “Credit 
to them, they worked hard, they 
played hard. I saw them Monday, 
they were really good. So much so 
that my wife said, ‘They pass the 
puck a lot better than your team,’ 
and they did tonight for the most 
part. Good team. 
“Good lesson for our team. Real 
good lesson on preparation and 
how you can never underestimate 
or take a night off unless you want 
to get beat. Doesn’t matter who you 
play.”
Midway 
through 
the 
first 
period, forward Ty Smilanic dove 
near the boards to pass the puck 
to defenseman Tyler Kleven who 
then took a shot from the blue line. 
Forward Hunter Strand got into 
the crease to help channel the puck 
into the net, and thus Michigan 

found itself down two goals early.
For the second frame, senior 
goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne 
entered the game in place of Mann. 
Just like in the first period, the 
Wolverines got another power 
play in the opening minutes of the 
second. This time, Michigan made 
better use of the man advantage 
than the first attempt and actually 
created 
scoring 
opportunities. 
Regardless, the offense came up 
empty handed once again.
For Pearson, the lackluster 
performance was emblematic of a 
poor week of preparation.
“We didn’t lose this game,” 
Pearson said. “We lost starting 
Monday. We were not very good 
in practice all week, so bad to the 
point I told them to stay away 
from the rink on Friday, so we 
didn’t practice yesterday. We were 
just mentally, physically — not 
everybody, but a majority of the 
guys, you could tell — you have 
a feel in practice of the intensity, 
the attention to detail, the focus, 
the work ethic, the compete, the 
execution, we were sloppy.”
One of the Wolverines’ key 
scoring chances of the game 
came while the second period 
was still fresh. The puck had been 
jammed up near the NTDP’s goal 
post but Michigan ultimately got 

the better angle, and soon after, 
redshirt sophomore forward Emil 
Öhrwall found the puck at the 
crease with nobody between him 
and goaltender Drew Commesso. 
Öhrwall immediately took the 
shot, but Commesso moved just in 
time to prevent the buzzer from 
sounding.
With just over nine minutes to 
go in the game, the NTDP regained 
possession of the puck in their 
defensive zone and went rushing 
down the ice. Soon, forward Luke 
Tuch rifled the puck past Lavigne. 
And in the final few minutes of 
the game, the Wolverines deficit 
widened when forward Smilanic 
found the back of the net one final 
time for his side.

In the last sixty seconds, 
Beecher fired a shot from the slot 
to finally get his team on the board. 
But it was too little, too late, and 
nobody needs to explain that to the 
freshman.
“I think this was a wake up 
call,” Beecher said of the loss. “Like 
coach said in the locker room, we 
almost needed this. It was a little 
slap in the face to us, nobody wants 
to go out and get beat by high 
school kids. We know that what we 
just did was wrong, and I’m sure 
the guys will be battling all week 
and trying to get better.”

Close wins propel ‘M’ 
to national tourney bid

It 
was 
getting 
late 
in 
Champaign 
as 
Michigan’s 
last match against Ole Miss 
went to a third-set tiebreaker. 
With the teams tied at three, 
the Wolverines’ bid to the 
ITA 
National 
Team 
Indoor 
Championship 
hung 
in 
the 
balance. 
A lightning-fast serve and 
mistakes 
from 
the 
Rebels’ 
Finn Reynolds helped propel 
freshman Ondrej Styler, and 
with him the Michigan men’s 
tennis team (4-1), to a 4-3 victory 
Saturday night. Michigan’s 2-0 
weekend at the ITA Kickoff — 
also featuring a similarly close 
4-3 victory over Texas Tech on 
Friday — earned 
them a bid to 
next 
month’s 
tournament 
in 
Madison.
“For 
a 
freshman 
to 
play 
under 
that 
pressure, 
knowing 
going 
to the national 
tournament was 
on the line, was 
incredible,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Adam Steinberg said. “In 30 
years I don’t think I’ve ever seen 
that, with it tied up three-all 
like we had.”
Friday’s 
match 
against 
the Red Raiders also ended 
dramatically, 
with 
senior 
Nick Beaty and Texas Tech’s 
Francisco Vittar set to break 
the 3-3 tie going into the final 
singles 
match. 
Beaty, 
who 
remains undefeated in singles 
play so far, prevailed on the 
match point in the third set after 
initially trailing.
Beaty’s 
performance 
in 
singles 
play, 
alongside 
undefeated 
junior 
Mattias 
Siimar, 
was 
an 
important 
factor 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ 
weekend success. On Saturday, 
the pair’s respective matches 
gave Michigan an early 3-0 
lead before Ole Miss beat 

sophomores Andrew Fenty and 
Ryan Fu to narrow the margin. 
“(Beaty and Siimar) are our 
two lefties and they’ve been 
playing great tennis,” Steinberg 
said. “For them to get us on the 
board like that, get us three 
quickly was very important and 
it took a lot of pressure off the 
other guys.”
Michigan, as it did last 
weekend against Washington 
and 
Oregon, 
showcased 
its 
ability to fight for the doubles 
point in both of the weekend’s 
matches. The duo of juniors 
Harrison Brown and Kristofer 
Siimar alongside senior Connor 
Johnston 
and 
Styler 
were 
dominant over the Red Raiders 
and the Rebels to secure the 
point.
“We 
all 
play for each 
other 
and 
it 
really shows in 
the 
doubles,” 
Steinberg said. 
“You know, it’s 
just one set and 
it’s tense but 
that’s when we 
shine. 
“We’re 
not 
going 
to 
achieve our goals without that 
doubles point; some think it’s 
just one point but when you 
play these really good teams, it 
comes down to that one point 
like it did this weekend.”
Despite 
their 
successes 
under Steinberg’s coaching, the 
Wolverines before now failed to 
reach his objective of qualifying 
for the ITA tournament. After 
consistent success in the spring 
season, he views it as the natural 
next step.
“It’s a huge moment for our 
program,” Steinberg said. “It’s 
something we’d really set as a 
goal, to check that box. To play 
in that tournament is special 
and how they did it was pretty 
incredible, so it was a lot of fun 
to see their faces afterwards in 
the locker room. They deserve it 
and have competed incredibly in 
the past few weeks.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

‘M’ falls, 64-
62, to Illinois

Ayo Dosunmu called game. 
Despite being hounded by Zavier 
Simpson, the Illinois guard, with ice in 
his veins, rose up over Michigan’s shorter 
senior point guard and drained the 
go-ahead jumper from the elbow with just 
0.5 seconds on the clock. 
“That last play was guarded as well as 
you could possibly guard it,” Illinois coach 
Brad Underwood said. “It was a really good 
player making a really hard shot. The one 
thing Ayo has at 6-foot-5 is the ability to get 
it over smaller guards so we just chose him 
to let it go.”
Just moments earlier, a much-needed 
victory over the Fighting Illini was within 
the Wolverines’ reach. 
But, after missing five consecutive free 
throws, the Michigan men’s basketball 
team (11-8 overall, 2-6 Big Ten) provided 
Illinois (15-5, 7-2) with the only lifeline it 
needed, ultimately losing its fourth straight 
game, 64-62, and suffering a blow with 
junior forward Isaiah Livers leaving the 
game with another injury. 
Spurred on by the return of Livers, who 
had missed six straight games with a groin 
injury, the Wolverines got off to a hot start 
— something they’ve failed to do of late. 
Illinois’ offense wouldn’t be contained 
for long. Its backcourt — one of the best 
in the conference — of Trent Frazier and 
Ayo Dosunmu led the way, killing the 
Wolverines with their outside shooting. 
Frazier knocked down two deep 3-pointers 
to 
quell 
Michigan’s 
energy, 
while 
Dosunmu’s mid-range game and slashing 
drives to the bucket were equally potent. 
The pair, which combined for 24 points on 
9-of-13 shooting in the first half, launched 
the Illini into an eight-point lead by the 7:58 
mark of the first half. 
Poor shooting plagued the Wolverines 
during that stretch, and Michigan went 
scoreless over a four-minute stretch. With 
their momentum interrupted and their 
backs against the wall, Michigan’s veterans 
responded. Teske, Livers and Simpson 
sprung to life late in the half, getting to 
the basket at every opportunity. In classic 
Simpson fashion, after lulling his defender 
to sleep at the top of the key, he bulldozed 
his way into the paint on multiple occasions, 
either drawing a foul or finishing the layup. 
Simpson polished off the first half with 
nine points in the final three minutes. 
And yet, despite the Wolverines’ best 
efforts, Illinois had an answer on the other 
end and entered the locker room up 34-30. 
Michigan exploded out of the locker 
room. After Cockburn, who was scoreless 
in the first twenty, converted a layup 
over Teske, Simpson and the Wolverines’ 
offense went to work. 
Orchestrating the offense to perfection, 
Simpson found Livers on the wing for 
a wide-open three. Freshman forward 
Franz Wagner also chipped in with two 
and-one layups. 
Michigan’s positive spurt to open the 
half was promptly halted five minutes in 
when Illinois’ Da’Monte Williams fouled 
Livers hard on a dunk attempt. The junior 
landed awkwardly, seemingly re-injuring 
his groin. After hitting both free-throws, 
he limped back to the bench and a hush fell 
over the Wolverine faithful. 
“Unfortunately for Isaiah, he went out 
with his injury,” Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard said, noting Livers is day-to-day. 
“We pray that he comes back healthy. His 
effort out there today was great. The energy 
from the crowd just shows how much he’s a 
huge part of this team’s success.”
Over the next few minutes, the Illini 
capitalized on the vapid atmosphere. As 
was the case all afternoon, Dosunmu 
proved to be Michigan’s kryptonite 
defensively. On consecutive possessions, 
Dosunmu pulled up from beyond the arc 
and hit a stepback jumper from the wing. 
“(Dosunmu) has been playing some good 
basketball these last few games,” Howard 
said. “He’s a very crafty player and does a 
really good job getting to his left hand and 
finishing in traffic. He’s also really good at 
getting to his pull-up jumper.” 
And, as was the case all afternoon, the 
Wolverines fought back. They were able 
to get stops defensively, forcing Cockburn 
to take some tough shots in the paint. 
Michigan regained the lead when Teske 
drained a 3-pointer from the top of the arc 
with 6:35 remaining. 
For every basket Dosunmu added to 
his final total of 27 points, the Wolverines 
collectively responded. Sophomore guard 
David DeJulius even gave Michigan a 
slender, two-point advantage after hitting 
a contested three from 30-feet. 
From there, though, things unraveled 
for the Wolverines. 
Despite holding Cockburn to just five 
points and three rebounds, containing 
Trent Frazier in the second-half, out-
rebounding the Illini and committing just 
two turnovers, Michigan let the game slip 
when it could least afford to. 
“We tried everything. I don’t think 
anybody can tell us that we didn’t play hard 
today,” Wagner said. “It just didn’t happen 
again. Free throws and a couple defensive 
lapses cost us. It’s tough.”

Brad Underwood’s conference 
with his assistants was short.
With 24 seconds left in a tie 
game against the Michigan men’s 
basketball team, the Illinois coach 
and his staff huddled just a few 
feet from the Fighting Illini bench 
during a timeout. His players 
looked on as the staff devised a 
final play call.
“It wasn’t a very long discussion 
amongst the coaches,” Underwood 
said. “… We just chose to let 
(sophomore guard Ayo Dosunmu) 
go.”
The call was simple. Underwood 
isolated Dosunmu — his best scorer 
— at the top of the key. No screens, 
off-ball motion or gimmicks of any 
kind. He wanted Dosunmu to have 
as much space as possible. Straight 
one-on-one basketball. Dosunmu’s 
only instruction was to begin his 
drive with six seconds left on the 
clock.
On the Wolverines’ side, senior 
point guard Zavier Simpson was 
tasked with stopping him. The 
very player who’s been lauded 
time 
and 
time 
again 
for 
his 
perimeter 
defense. 
The 
name 
that’s become synonymous with 
a pitbull mentality and relentless 
determination.
It was Big Ten basketball at its 
finest. The intensity in the moment, 
the implications of the outcome 
and, most importantly, the sheer 
will to win.
Dosunmu began inching closer 
when the clock struck six seconds, 
as Underwood directed. He drove 
left, planted his right foot at the 
free throw line and stopped on a 
dime. But when he tried to get a 
shot off, Simpson was in his face. 
He looked up and saw two seconds 

showing on the backboard clock. 
He brought his left foot across his 
body to create space, but it didn’t do 
much.
And with barely enough room 
to breathe, the 6-foot-5 Dosunmu 
elevated over the 6-foot-0 Simpson 
and rattled home a game-winning 
jump shot to push No. 21 Illinois 
past Michigan, 64-62.
“It’s what great players do,” 
Underwood said. “That last play 
was guarded as well as you could 
possibly guard it, and there was just 
a really good player making a really 
hard shot.”
The Fighting Illini knew exactly 

what they wanted to do with the 
last possession. The Wolverines, on 
the other hand, did not.
When a reporter asked Michigan 
coach Juwan Howard if he expected 
Dosunmu to be isolated, Howard 
began 
his 
answer 
before 
the 
reporter could finish the question.
“No I did not, I did not expect 
that at all,” Howard said. “I 
expected some type of wrinkle or 
high ball screen.”
That 
wrinkle 
never 
came. 
Instead, 
Dosunmu 
delivered 
his 26th and 27th points of the 
afternoon. With it, he became the 
fourth opposing player to set a new 

career-high against the Wolverines 
this season, joining Iowa’s Luka 
Garza, Purdue’s Trevion Williams 
and Minnesota’s Daniel Oturu.
“(Dosunmu) does a really good 
job of getting to his right hand and 
finishing in traffic,” Howard said. 
“He’s also good with the pull-up 
jumper. They run some ball screens 
with him, and he’s very crafty in 
using the ball screen. It just so 
happened today — every player has 
it in sports — sometimes, you’re 
going to have a great night. He had 
a great night.”
Added sophomore guard David 
DeJulius: “(Dosunmu) is a long 
guard, very crafty. He can shoot the 
ball off the dribble, off the set shot, 
able to get in the lane and create for 
himself and his teammates. He’s a 
really good player. He has a lot of 
options to his game and it’s hard to 
stop.”
It wasn’t a matter of Dosunmu 
catching fire at certain points. 
Michigan didn’t have an answer at 
any point in the game, as he scored 
27 points on 11-of-18 shooting. He 
entered Saturday shooting 28.6% 
from beyond the arc before sinking 
two of his three 3-point attempts 
against the Wolverines.
“Basketball is about a rhythm 
thing,” DeJulius said. “They put 
a lot of confidence in him and put 
the ball in his hands the whole 
game and we kind of let him find a 
groove early. He just went with that 
because he had his juices flowing 
from the start.”
By 
the 
end 
of 
the 
game, 
Dosunmu’s rhythm was at its peak. 
It was only fitting for him to deliver 
the dagger.
“When you have a close game 
like that,” DeJulius said, “you leave 
it up for grabs to let anyone get the

Dosunmu got the game.

It’s what great 
players do. That 
last play was 
guarded as well 
as you could 
possibly guard.

Illinois guard Ayo Dosunmu scored the game-winning shot with 0.5 seconds left over Zavier Simpson, giving his team a decisive two-point lead.

Freshman forward Franz Wagner missed two key free throws down the stretch of Michigan’s 64-62 loss to Illinois on Saturday.

Missed 
free throws 
doom ‘M’ 
late

Step up to the line. Give high-fives to 
the guys lining up on the paint. Stretch 
out an arm or a quad. Catch the ball 
from the ref. Take a dribble, maybe two. 
Maybe practice a shooting motion.
A buzzing crowd at the Crisler 
Center claps once, then goes silent, the 
air teeming with their anticipation. 
Visualize it: that perfect arc; net, net, 
net. 
One more dribble. 
The ball goes up, and for a few tense 
seconds, everything on the court — 
everything in the arena — narrows in 
on nylon and iron and glass.
The shot doesn’t fall.
And moments later, someone in 
orange puts up a game-winning prayer, 
and this time it does fall, and it’s over. 
And there, in that moment as the clock 
winds down to zero and a collective 
gasp 
escapes 
the 
once-exuberant 
crowd, is defeat, yet again, taken 
cruelly from the jaws of a desperately-
needed victory.
In the final minutes of Michigan’s 
heartbreaking 64-62 loss to No. 21 
Illinois at home on Saturday, the 
Wolverines missed five straight free 
throws in the final three-and-a-half 
minutes of the game. 
Five.
Five missed opportunities. Five 
opportunities that could have, maybe 
should have, changed the outcome of 
a game Michigan could not afford to 
lose. Five opportunities to snap a three-
game losing streak. Five opportunities 
to defend home court in a conference 
where it’s imperative to do so.
And not one of them went in.
“Yeah, it’s really tough right now,” 
freshman wing Franz Wagner said, 
visibly upset, after the game. “But the 
way our culture works is that we just 
stick together. We come closer together 
and we’ll figure it out. I like the way 
we fought throughout the whole game. 
Just gotta reward ourselves at the end.”
Michigan led, 62-60, with two and 
a half minutes left in regulation. It 
was awarded three free throws after 
gaining that lead — free throws that, 
if made, would’ve made it a two-
possession game. That, if made, just 
might have moved Saturday’s loss into 
the win column.
At this point in the season, those are 
not chances that the Wolverines can 
afford to give up. And the team knew it.
“It 
hurts. 
It 
hurts 
everyone,” 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard said. 
“It’s just unfortunate for us, because 
we didn’t do a good job of making our 
free throws.
“You come in after a game like this, 
when you lose it, and you see nothing 
but red eyes. And you know that heads 
are down. Everyone’s been crying. It’s 
awful. And it hurts you as a coach. 
Because I feel like I let them down.
“That’s the worst feeling ever.”
Michigan now sits at 11-8 overall, and 
a disheartening 2-6 in conference play, 
putting it tied with Ohio State for 10th 
in the Big Ten. It is far from where they 
pictured themselves at the beginning 
of the season, and even farther from 
where everyone saw them after their 
stunning run in the Bahamas two 
months ago.
More importantly, though, it is far 
from where this team could be, if just a 
few of those opportunities had shaken 
out differently.
March is closer than the Bahamas 
now. And if Michigan wants to make the 
NCAA Tournament — something that’s 
seeming more and more questionable 
these last few weeks — they need to 
start winning games like these. At 
11-8, with six conference losses, the 
Wolverines don’t exactly have a sterling 
tournament resume. 
The emotion — the disappointment 
— that is inextricably linked to the 
realization that Michigan is not playing 
as well as it can is clear in the players’ 
faces. It was palpable in Wagner’s voice 
as he choked up talking about how 
the game slipped out of his hands to a 
crowd of reporters surrounding him. 
It’s probably not unrelated to the 
team’s struggles as of late. For a team 
— and a coach — that has preached 
confidence from the start, it is growing 
ever harder to believe, and that lack of 
self-assuredness has been hurting them 
in games lately — games they need to be 
winning if they want to stick around for 
March.
“I’m not gonna lie, it’s really hard for 
me to stand up here right now,” Wagner 
said. “It’s my two free throws. Yeah, 
it’s really hard. That’s how basketball 
works, though. Obviously, you gotta be 
ready for those type of moments.”
