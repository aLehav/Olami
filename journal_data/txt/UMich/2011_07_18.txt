Common Application

For the fifth consecutive year,
the University received a record
number of applications from stu-
dents hoping to attend the Univer-
sity in the fall - 39,570 applicants
compared to last year's 31,613,
'according to University Provost
Philip Hanlon.
Hanlon wrote in an e-mail
interview he credits the increase to
the University's switch to the Com-
mon Application - a website that
allows students to apply to multiple
universities with one application.
"Because the University of
Michigan went to the Common
App this year, we anticipated some
increase in application numbers,
but I was surprised by the growth
in application numbers that we
have actually experienced," Hanlon
wrote.
He added that the prestige of
the University and the value of
receiving a degree from the Univer-
sity draw students to apply.
"This surge in applications, par-
ticularly from non-residents, is one
more sign that students and parents
across the country recognize the
value of a University of Michigan
degree," Hanlon wrote.

DPS and AAPD
deny an increase in
city crime rates
By PATRICIA SNIDER
Daily StaffReporter
Despite numerous recent
reports of crime in Ann Arbor,
both the Ann Arbor Police
Department and the University's
Department of Public Safety
claim crime rates are in fact not
on the rise.
Sgt. Mike Lance of the Ann

Arbor Police Department said
that while students may feel they
have received an increased num-
ber of crime alerts - especially
in light of a recent shooting that
occurred on Thompson Street on
July 1 and two sexual assaults
that occurred near Community
High School and on Greenwood
Avenue this past weekend - in
actuality crime rates in the city
have been on the decline com-
pared to years past.
Lance said the media has
exaggerated crime in Ann Arbor,
which has negatively shaped
public perception of crime rates

in the community.
"There's probably more
media attention, and there's
more reporting of (crimes),"
Lance said. "I think (the media)
does have an effect on the out-
look on crime ... I think it also
makes people more aware of
their surroundings."
Lance said the University's
Department of Public Safety and
AAPD engage in a cooperative
relationship and support each
other in handling crime, adding
the collaboration is currently
"better than it's ever been."

Ann Arbor's homeless tent city faces
scrutiny after string of small crimes

Despite accusations,
camp denies being a
danger to the county
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Managing News Editor
Ann Arbor's self-governed
homeless tent city, Camp Take
Notice, has recently gained atten-
tion among the community for
their alleged involvement in small
crimes in the neighborhood around
the campground.
Lt. Brian Filipiak of the Washt-
enaw County Sheriff's Depart-
ment said neighbors near CTN
- located west of I-94 off Wagner
Road - expressed concern over
"suspicious activity," like people
throwing personal belongings and
jumping over the guardrails of the
overpass.
The neighborhood has also
seen an increase in parking vio-
lations in relation to CTN, most-
ly from volunteers parking in
no-parking zones, Filipiak said.
However, the only crime the
department can tie directly back
the homeless population at CTN
is an incident where neighbors
reported a patio set had been stolen
from their property and was later
recovered from the camp, accord-
ing to Filipiak.
CTN leader Caleb Poirier said
he doesn't believe the people living
in the camp are harming the com-
munity, but rather they are serving

as additional "eyes andears"to bet-
ter watch over the neighborhood.
"I don't fault people for having
anxiety of (crimes)," Piorier said.
"I think it's an understandable
concern, but this population is not
necessarily of more trouble than
the people who are residing in the
area."
All residents of CTN are
required to promise to restrain
from using illegal substances and
must sign an agreement upon mov-
ing to the camp stating they won't
engage in violent activity or behave
in ways disruptive to the commu-
nity. Poirier said those who break
CTN rules are evicted and removed
from camp premises.
Poirier said the Washtenaw
County Sheriff's Department has
been a great resource for them,
and the department makes weekly
visits to the camp, as requested by
CTN.
"I think (the Sheriff's Depart-
ment) has made the best of a dif-
ficult situation, and I have no
complaints with the way they've
treated us," Poirier said.
University graduate student
Jeff Albanese, a board member of
MISSION and an anthropology
and social work master's student
who studies contemporary tent cit-
ies, said CTN has a good relation-
ship with the Washtenaw County
Sheriff's Department and people
are drawing "premature" connec-
tions between crime and homeless-
ness that further marginalize the
homeless population.

Albanese added the general
public thinks of the homeless pop-
ulation as a group prone to crime,
but said "tent cities do not breed
crime" but rather are part of the,
"American landscape" and have
existed peacefully for years.
"There isn't any concrete evi-
dence between CTN residence and
the crimes (around the camp),"
Albanese added.
Mark Geib, director of the
Michigan Department of Trans-
portation's Brighton Transporta-
tion Service Center, said while
CTN has been on MDOT prop-
erty for more than a year, they've
had little concerns with the camp,
though they do at times worry
about safety issues.
Despite the occasional con-
cern from community members,
CTN has served as an alternative
housing option for the commu-
nity's homeless population as local
shelters have faced difficulty amid
tough economic times.
Don Austin, chief operat-
ing officer at Shelter Association
of Washtenaw County, said they
faced $120,000 in funding cuts this
year effective July 1, which forced
the local homeless shelter to close
its triage center that housed 5to 10
people for short periods of time.
Along with the closure,
employees were shuffled around
within the shelter and some full-
time positions were reduced to
part-time positions, he said.
He added the funding cuts also
prompted the Shelter to focus more

heavily on prevention rather than
assistance to those who are already
homeless.
Since CTN came to the city,
the shelter has seen an increase in
public awareness of homelessness,
Austin said, adding that shedding
light on a serious issue is one of the
greatest resources a group can pro-
vide.
The camp is currently working
with churches in the community to
find a permanent location, Poirier
said, though he acknowledged the
move wouldn't happen overnight.
Brian Nord, president of Mich-
igan Itinerant Shelter System:
Interdependent Out of Necessity
- a non-profit organization that
works with CTN - agreed the
camp needs a permanent location
in order to form closer ties with the
community, especially since the
county has faced local budget cuts
in recent years and many organiza-
tions that help house the homeless
are suffering.
He added CTN is vital to the
community because local services
can only house about 400 people
compared to the approximately
4,700 people who are homeless in
the county at some point through-
out the year.
CTN is gaining prominence
in the community as well as inter-
nally for its organized system that
allows people living there to have
some semblance of control over
their lives, Nord said.
"CTN focuses on community
and self-agency," he said.
In fact, CTN was positively
recognized for its ties to the com-
munity and received an "Adopt
a Highway" sign on Saturday for
their work with the stretch of 1-94
near the camp, according to Brian
Durance, a board member of MIS-
SION.
"A lot of them feel vindicated ...
they feel acknowledged (because
of the sign)," Durance said.
Poirier said there are many
benefits to tent cities, like their
ability to lift people out of pov-
erty and prevent extreme cases of
homelessness by providing struc-
ture and resources such as bus
transportation, food and shelter.
"People are often concerned
because they think tent cities wors-
en homelessness, but instead they
make it visible," Poirier said.

'U' alumni work to change the image'of Detroit

Graduates bring new
enterprise to the
dilapidated city
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
In 2008, Detroit landed on
Forbes' annual list of "America's
Most Miserable Cities," and hope
that its automakers could com-
pete with foreign counterparts
dwindled. As the city's population
continues to decline and its unem-
ployment rate remains higher
than the national average, the fear
that Detroit is slowly disintegrat-
ing remains steadfast.
However, there are increas-
ing signs of economic growth and
vitality appearing throughout the
city, most prominently through
the work of young adults - includ-
ing University alumni - who are
ADMISSIONS

Undergraduate Admissions, said
the University expected an increase
in applicants when they joined the
Common App since other schools
that made the switch over the years
have seen between a 6-percent and
30-percent increase.
Spencer added that while the
website makes it easy for students
to applyto manyschools at once, it's
not the only reason for the increase.
In fact, Spencer said the University
has seen a surge in applicants for 10
years prior to when they switched
to the new application.
The academic reputation of
the University makes people want
to apply, Spencer said, and over
the past several years the great-
est increase in applicants has been
among out-of-state students.
"Michigan has an outstand-
ing academic reputation. We have
outstanding faculty, we have out-
standing facilities and we have out-
standing students," he said..
Furthermore, the University's
more than 300 majors and approxi-
mately 3,000 courses are a "big
draw" to high school seniors look-
ing to apply to college, Spencer said.
He added the increase in finan-
cial aid - namely the $137 million
increase the University's Board of
Regents approved this year in light

developing new businesses, chari-
ties and art projects in the spaces
left derelict after the decade of
economic struggles.
Among the college-educated
Detroit newcomers is 23-year-old
University alum Jimmy Tomc-
zak, who founded TOMBOLO - a
company that makes sandals from
recycled billboard vinyl that imi-
tates the feel of being barefoot -
in September 2010. Tomczak said
he was inspired to start the com-
pany through the University's fos-
tering of entrepreneurial spirit as
well as his own personal vision of
a revitalized Detroit.
"My vision isn't just the shoes,
but the vision to promote con-
scious consumption and creative
reuse," Tomczak said.."And I think
that is a much greater impact and
a much bigger vision to have, to
be able to say that it's not just the
tangible, but both the tangible and
intangible innovations that hap-
of state budgetcuts to higher educa-
tion - also serves as an incentive for
students to apply to the University.
"Anything we can do to reduce
the cost of an education is an incen-
tive," Spencer said. "It can't do any-
thing but help."
Due to these incentives, the
University is expecting the enter-
ing class to be about 5,970 students
- approximately 500 students less
than last year, Spencer said.
As of June, 16,046 applicants
were offered admission and 6,540
paid the enrollment deposit, but
even those who paid the deposit
may not choose to attend the Uni-
versity in the fall,. according to a
July 13 University press release.
The press release also said
admissions are based on a holistic
review of the individualized infor-
mation received about each appli-
cant, including the high schools
students attend and if those schools
are not already significantly repre-
sented at the University.
The University received 4,265
applications from underrepresent-
ed minority students - a 14.8-per-
cent increase from last year - and
1,576 were offered admission, which
is a decrease of 3.7 percent, accord-
ing to the release.
The University will announce
the final statistics as well as an
analysis of applicants by race, gen-
der and other specifics in October,
the release said.

pen as a result of creativity in a
place like Detroit."
Tomczak said he believes
Detroit is ready to "experience
a rebirth" and the burgeoning
entrepreneurial culture has uplift-
ed the city and revamped its busi-
ness landscape.
"It's about those people that
are connecting and coming back
together with the city in mind,"
he said. "There are so many things
happening like that with youth
and different connections that
it's not just about automotive and
corporate protection anymore. It's
about the students, entrepreneurs
and makers that are out there
doing it."
The shift is partially the
result of demographic trends over
the last decade. While a quar-
ter of Detroit's population fled in
response to economic hardships,
duringthat same time the city saw
a 59-percent increase in college-

1 article in The New York Times.
Donald Grimes, a senior
research associate at the Univer-
sity's Institute for Research on
Labor, Employment and the Econ-
omy, said youth play a crucial role
in revitalizing the city.
"That's probably the most
important positive indicator that
there's more involvement and
more interest in people from your
generation," Grimes said. "They
see it as sort of an exciting place
to try to work in and revive. You're
sort of on the cutting edge of
urban revitalization."
Mashawnta Armstrong, a
28-year-old University alum, lec-
turer in the University's Taubman

in-chief of MASH Magazine, said
she was similarly inspired. As a
native of Detroit, Armstrong pub-

take responsibility of their per-
sonal possessions.
"If students and people can
do a better job at keeping their
belongings secure, then we would
have less crime," Brown said.
While theft is the most com-
mon campus crime, Brown said
that personal crimes do occur
and drinking may cause people to
be more "vulnerable" and suscep-
tible to situations where they may
be endangered.
"Perpetrators see a more
easily-targeted, vulnerable per-
son, and then would try to rob
t them and rarely try to assault
them," Brown said. "Many of
the assaults really are equally
blamed on both sides ... we rarely
will see an unprovoked stranger

Brown said a range of mea-

"The purpose (of MASH)
is to change that perception of
Detroit," Armstrong said. "We
always see the negative connota-

it's dirty, it's dilapidated. There's
so many negative things that reso-

that with the magazine."

the bottom of electronic crime

versity places such libraries and

Ultimately, she said the issue
lies in personal responsibility of
University members in following
the suggested safety measures.
"The problem isn't that peo-
ple aren't being informed about
this stuff - the problem is that
they aren't adhering to many of

Stymying support
Michigan shouldn't cut funding to welfare recipients
Michigan is in a critical economic position. It's no
secret that the state is facing vast deficit problems,
but the measures the current government are tak-
ing to address them seem to ignore the fact that the citizens
of Michigan are also facing the same problems. Last week, the
Michigan State Senate passed a bill to put a 48-month lifetime
limit on the state's welfare programs in order to cut govern-
mental spending. At a time when many Americans, especially
those from Michigan are struggle to find a job, let alone gain-
ful income for their families, this legislation couldn't be less
appropriate. Republican Gov. Rick Snyder must not sign this
bill into law.

There's something magical about
the FIFA World Cup.
How else do you explain a nation
passionately supporting a sport that
it has little to no interest in dur-
ing the in-between years? Paling in
comparison to other sports' fan base
during the non-World Cup years,
the soccer fandom in America sud-
denly comes to life at the sight of
seeing the red, white and blue take
on the world. Whether watching
the men or women's team, Ameri-
cans find themselves sitting on
the edge of their seat during every
World Cup game.
Most American sports fans will
say they like watching soccer. But if
they were at home in search of some
good quality time with their televi-
sion and a sports game, the sport of
choice probably wouldn't be soccer.
Given the choice between watch-
ing the Major League Soccer or
any other sport, most people would
choose the NFL, NBA, MLB or even
the NHL. Most Americans would
probably prefer to watch at least
half a dozen other sports before
being forced to watch MLS.
But why is it that when USA is
competing in the World Cup, the
sport has America's full attentioni
Sports fans who couldn't care less
about soccer suddenly have up-to-
date knowledge of the sport and
think they are expert analysts and
strategists. Non-sports fans are
suddenly intrigued by sports and
delighted to be able to participate in
water-cooler conversations at work.
Not only do non-sports fans rise
from the dead during the World
Cup, but there also isn't another
sporting event that ignites such
enthusiasm and fervor among them.
Everyone knows what Brandi
Chastain did in 1999. Her penalty
kick goal that won the Women's
World Cup and her celebratory dis-
robing is an iconic moment in Amer-
ican sports.
And any person with a capable
memory won't be forgetting what
Landon Donovan did any time soon.
His dramatic goal against Algeria
during the group stage of last year's
World Cuphadthe whole nation run-
ning around their houses screaming
with pride and excitement.
And now, Abby Wambach is
the latest soccer player to receive
instant fame through the World
Cup. Her miraculous header against
Brazil mesmerized the nation and
cemented her into American sports

lore, as athletes and even the presi-
dent tweeted about her goal. Her
repeat performances against France
and Japan only made the legend
grow.
So what exactly is it about the
World Cup that gets America
watching?
Well, it definitely has nothing to
do with our love for the sport, that's
for sure.
Some might answer that we're
enthralled because of our patrio-
tism. But when's the last time a
United States National team was
as celebrated as when the men's or
women's national soccer team is in
the World Cup? It definitely wasn't
the USA Basketball team - nick-
named the "Redeem Team" - that
finally won the gold medal at the
2008 Olympics after countless
failed efforts at various interna-
tional events. Nor was it the USA
women's soccer team that won the
gold medal at the last two summer
Olympics, two achievements that
received little fanfare.
You might have to goallthe back
to the 1980 Olympics, when the Unit-
ed States Hockey team won the gold
medal at Lake Placid, to find a time
when most Americans were invest-
ing so much effort into following a
national team. But still, they were
mainly celebrated for just beating the
Soviet Union, our cold war rivals and
hockey powerhouse.
While the Olympics might have
us all cheering for USA, the multi-
tude of events divides our unity.
The FIFA World Cup is different.
Our undivided attention is focused
on soccer, and soccer only. The com-
petition electrifies the whole nation,
creating an inextinguishable unity.
During group stage games, fans
are preoccupied by soccer, glued
to their televisions. And during
Knock-out round games, American
flags and USA soccer jerseys can be
seen draping even the most casual
fans. We watch because it unites us.
In unity, we all watched USA's
agonizing defeat to Japan. It was a
crushing blow, but also a feel-good
story. For Japan, the win lifted the
spirits and hopes of a nation that
had been crushed by disaster. It
brought immense joy to a country
that hasn't had many reasons to
smile of late.
So maybe there is something mag-
ical about this tournament after all.

The new lifetime limit will
not only affect future recipients
of welfare, but also the current
families who receive benefits.
No families will be grandfa-
thered in and those who expect-
ed to receive benefits into the
next year will suddenly see their
monthly income drop by an aver-
age of $515. 12,600 families will
lose benefits on Oct. 1 and the
majority of the people affected
will be children. Many adults in
this program already have jobs
and are struggling to re-enter or
stay in the workforce, but can-
not earn enough money to sup-
port their families. These are
not people who should be cut off
from welfare.
Officially, the national unem-
ployment rate is just under 10
percent. But most economists
estimate that the percentage of
people who do not have full-time

jobs or are not currently seek-
ing work is closer to 15 percent.
At a time when even the most
experienced professionals are
out of work and filling jobs they
are overqualified for, it's going
to be extremely difficult for low-
income families to find employ-
ment that provides enough money
to cover their basic cost of living.
The current economic crisis has
placed many people in a financial
situation that they couldn't antici-
pate. They're not just freeload-
ers, as some lawmakers suggest.
Many of these people are victims
of recent economic troubles and
abruptly slashing their income
supplements could be disastrous.
These are families with children,
and cutting them off from welfare
is one of the most callous ways for
the state to save money.
Welfare has been reformed
and adjusted since its inception.

Unfortunately, there will always
be people who take advantage of
loopholes in governmental ben-
efits if they can. There is good
language in the current welfare
bill that disallows the spending of
benefits onthings like alcohol and
the lottery, but this hardly makes
up for the detriment it imposes on
struggling families. Michigan's
welfare system may need further
revision, but reducing lifetime
limits at a time like this is the
wrong solution to save money.
Democrats suggested providing
exceptions to the 48-month limit
in communities where unemploy-
ment is greater than 25 percent,
but Republicans passed on the
offer. Michigan citizens deserve
more than a tough-luck attitude
from its government. This aus-
tere legislation will cost Michigan
families and children far more
than the government will save.

Health hypocrisy

Amid the illegal fireworks,
trips with the family, and back-
yard bar-
beques on
the Fourth,
there is a com-
mon senti-
ment about
the history of
this country.
Whether it is
the sacrifice MAX
of the soldiers LEVENSTEIN
fighting for
freedom or the
pride we have of being citizens
of this nation, we call ourselves
Americans and we are proud of it.
We are all a part of our coun-
try and share a unity through
this common bond. Our politi-
cians address us not as individu-
als, but by "fellow Americans."
We are a community of people
joined under a common good and
care about our fellow Americans.
Or at least on the Fourth of July.
Fast forward two weeks, past
the glamour of our holiday and
the pressure to act patriotic.
Debates still rage on among the
Republican presidential can-
didates as to who is the most
against the new healthcare plan.
"I will repeal Obamacare," says
Mitt Romney. On the other end,
the Minnesota twin dream team
of Bachmann and Pawlenty think
they would each be better suited
to repeal the terrible govern-
ment takeover of our lives and
let the free market do the work.
So much for caring about fellow
Americans.
I supposeitmayberighttodeny
tens of millions of Americans
access to health care, because
let's face it, if you can't afford it
you don't deserve to be healthy.
We need to stick to the free mar-
ket because it has never steered
us wrong. Money is what really
matters and we cannot afford to
maintain a healthy population if
we want to compete with China.
Unfortunately this sarcasm
isn't shared by Americans
opposed to Obamacare. They put
money before life and the free
market before humanity. Do they
care about others who live in
their country and are also Amer-
ican? I would venture to say they
do, but they are blinded by their
dogmatic political and economic
ideologies.
We have seen decades of proof

that suggests that the health care
industry in America has failed to
live up to the standards that we
require. It is time for a change:
something that not only makes
more economic sense, but is
more consistent with our vision
of what America is. We have to
care about the health of other
Americans and cannot simply
ignore the fact that millions are
undertreated.
Health care is different from
nice cars and fine wine. It is not
something we want to go out
and buy because it will make us,
happy, but something we need to
maintain in order for everything
else to matter. Without a healthy
life, what is there? We must have
a quality and comprehensive
health care system as the first pri-
ority in all policy decisions, never
putting money, tax breaks or
competition with China above it.
Without a
healthy life,
what is there?
Guaranteeing health care for
all Americans is by no means
economic suicide. In fact, of
the dozens of countries that
have successfully implemented
national health care systems, all
spend less per patient compared
to the United States, while still
maintaining the same status of
public health, if not better. There
is a lot of room for improvement
here, all we need to do is take
advantage of this opportunity.
No longer can we call our-
selves "fellow Americans" and
sit back while millions of people
around the country continue to
live unhealthy lives. Let us feel
the comradery that the fourth
of July brings to us. Let us feel
for other Americans who cannot
afford to be as healthy as their
rich peers. People do not deserve
health care because they can
afford it, they deserve it because
anyone who calls themselves an
American deserves the opportu-
nity for a happy and healthy life.

Freedom isn't simple

With the coming and goingofthe
Fourth of July, one thing I've been
thinking about
is freedom. As
a twenty-year-
old American
woman, I've had
it pretty cushy.
More than that,
everything I
know about free-
dom has been VANESSA
shaped by every RYCHLINSKI
social studies _______
class I've taken
in every grade since elementary
school. That and bumper stickers. I
recently saw the phrase "Freedom
Isn't Free" slapped onto the back
of a fourteen person SUV - right
in between one equating being pro-
choice to being pro-death, and one
quoting a bible verse about the sanc-
tity of marriage. This five-by-eight
philosophy raised some questions.
Basically, what I really want to
know is - what the hell does any-
one really know?
The recent unrest in the Middle
East and Africa is almost unimagi-
nable. Accounts of governments
firing on their own citizens have
been appalling, but the violence
goes deeper. A June 16 CNN arti-
cle claims that soldiers loyal to
the Gaddafi regime have been tor-
turing prisoners, and there's cell
phone video to prove it. One alleg-
edly depicts soldiers sodomizing a
Libyan woman with a broomstick.
Libyan rebels claim that they have
a number of phones in their posses-
sion with similar recordings.
Then there's the plight of
Iman al-Obeidi, a lawyer who
was detained before being gang-
raped for two days by members of
Gaddafi's militia. After escaping,
al-Obeidi attempted to talk to for-
eign journalists in a Tripoli hotel,

only to be dragged away by hotel
staff and government personnel.
According to a March 27 Washing-
ton Post article, in a phone call to
al-Obeidi's mother, Libyan govern-
ment officials told her that if her
daughter reneged on all her claims,
they would provide her with "any-
thing she wanted." Al-Obeidi told
her mother, "I will die rather than
change my words."
Though there are more stories
arising from this conflict, these are
the two that get to me the most. The
Libyan people are collectively pay-
ing a high price in both happinness
and dignity - while most inthe U.S.
only have to deal with the high price
of gas.
As a student at the University of
Michigan, I've had it pretty easy.
Students have several great forums
in which to publicize pet issues. The
recent smoking ban is more of an
exercise in futility than a limit on
personal freedom - any official of
a learning institution ought to know
that we've all been taught to resist
"peer pressure." There's some kind
of organization to cater to almost
any student's interests or back-
ground - whatever issue gets your
goat, you're free to grandstand in
the Diag. Though tuition isn't free,
every day we have the opportunity
to make the choices indicative of
our true selves - from the clothes
we wear to the opinions we hold.
Back in February, I was annoyed at
a Facebook event page for an"Egypt
Liberation" themed rave. In May, I
was uncomfortable that students
partied in front of the White House
when Bin Laden was shot. Last
week, I was angered by a new blog
devoted to this current age of revo-
lution, cutely named Revolt Riot,
which sells clothing.
Getting to the point here, my
personal philosophy for situations
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:

move here from mountains to clubs,
White House merrymaking and
tasteless t-shirts. I'm not sure how
entitled I am to make any sort of
judgment here. I could easily exer-
cise my uncultivated, unearned
freedom in the same ways - I'm
just as free as any other American to
attend a rave, celebrate the death of
a terrorist or buy a "Keep Calm and
Riot On" wristband. I am a young
woman living in the freest nation
in the world, attending one of the
most accommodating schools in the
country, and yet I have not strug-
gled for any of it. Al-Obeidi would
rather die than change her words -
to me, "changing my words" means
editing this column. Freedom is not
free, so the stickers say, and I know
it is worth something, a big some-
thing. But what do I really know if I
haven't struggled for it?

Howard leads class of16 entering Hall of Fame

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Desmond Howard, a former
Michigan football standout and
current analyst for ESPN College
GameDay, was enshrined into the
College Football Hall of Fame in an
induction ceremony on Saturday.
The prolific wide receiver led a
group of 15 other players and four
coaches into the Hall of Fame in
South Bend, Ind.
"This is a huge honor for me to
be here in South Bend," Howard
said during a teleconference with
reporters on Thursday. "I couldn't
be more proud to go into the Col-
lege Football Hall of Fame as a
Michigan Wolverine.
"It's not being acknowledged
for a game. It's not being acknowl-
edged for a season - it's being
acknowledged for a whole body of
work - that speaks volumes."
Howard set or tied five NCAA
and 12 Michiganindividual records
in his three-year stint with the
Wolverines. He caught 134 passes
for 2,145 yards and returned three
kicks for touchdowns.
Howard's junior season earned
him the Heisman Trophy - and
Michigan a Rose Bowl berth - and
was punctuated by a kickoff return
for a touchdown against Ohio State
in the season finale that prompted

legendary ABC broadcaster Keith
Jackson to pronounce, "Hello,
Heisman!"
Obviously unaware of Jackson's
call, Howard paused for a moment
after crossing the goal line and
struck the infamous Heisman pose,
cementing that image into college
football lore.
But that's simply the tail end of a
magical season.
"The Heisman pose is pretty
much the cherry on top," Howard
admitted.
Twenty years later, Howard
remembers it all.
"It's hard for me to believe (it
was 20 years ago), especially when
I look in the mirror and I'm 20
years older," Howard said. "Feels
like it just happened. The time
flies, it really does."
He remembers the season-open-
er against Boston College, when
he scored four touchdowns, and
he remembers Notre Dame rolling
into town the following week as
the No.7 team in the nation.
And he remembers quarterback
Elvis Grbac's pump-fake and loft
to the end zone on fourth down.
Everyone remembers the rest.
Howard sped past a pair of
defensive backs down the right
sideline and dove to the back cor-
ner of the end zone, making the
iconic catch for a touchdown and

land into a national icon in college son, who won the Heisman Trophy
football. in 1997.

When asked whether he felt his
jersey should be retired, Howard
had no hesitation.
"I believe it's time, without the
shadow of a doubt," Howard said.
"It's just such a huge honor, and
what I do know for a living is you
travel around and you see how a
lot of these programs have retired
jerseys of players who haven't even
accomplished some of the things
on the field like myself and Wood-
son have accomplished. It's just a
way they try to honor their play-
ers."
Howard also announced that
his book, I Wore 21: The Legend
of Desmond Howard, is expect-
ed to be released on Sept. 10, the
same day as the first night game
in Michigan Stadium history. The
190-page book will chronicle How-
ard's life before, during and after
his time in Ann Arbor.
But as he places his lasting leg-
acy in the College Football Hall of
Fame, Howard is just focused on
the three years at Michigan that
brought him into the national spot-
light.
"It's mind-blowing how far I've
come since that first day packing
up the van with my dad and drove
up to Ann Arbor from Cleveland,"
Howard said.
"Who knew the road would take
us to South Bend?"

'M' legend has 'utmost confidence' in Robinson as QB

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
In late May, Desmond Howard
found himself in some hot water
after calling out Michigan quar-
terback Denard Robinson when
speaking of the entitlement of
modern-day athletes.
"I'll give you a perfect exam-
ple," Howard said at the Black
Coaches and Administrators con-
vention in St. Petersburg, Fla.
"Michigan fires coach Rich Rodri-
guez. All the noise in Ann Arbor
is, 'Is Denard Robinson going to
stay or leave?' I'm like, 'Hey, if the
kid wants to go, don't let the door
hit you on the way out.' You looked
* fantastic for five games against
nobody. That's what you did.
"I'm not going to deny his tal-
ents, but you ain't won nothing
in Ann Arbor, son! Not so much
we need to worry about if you're
going to be here next year or not."

But in a conference call with
reporters on Thursday regarding
his College Football Hall of Fame
induction, Howard was clear that
there's no bad blood between the
duo of past and present Wolver-
ines.
There were worries that Rob-
inson would transfer after Rodri-
guez was relieved of his post in
early January - sending Michi-
gan's highlight reel out the door
with Rodriguez's spread offense -
but Robinson ultimately made the
decision to remain in Ann Arbor to
quarterback the Wolverines.
Even with a new offensive sys-
tem in place under new Michigan
coach Brady Hoke and offensive
coordinator Al Borges, Howard
thinks Robinson will adjust well.
"I have the utmost confidence
that Denard is going to do well
in this offense, because I have
confidence in Denard as a serious
athlete and coach Borges as an

offensive coordinator who knows
how to use the strength of his play-
ers," Howard said. "I spoke with
Denard during spring football,
and I think the most complicated
part for a quarterback like Denard
is to get the footwork down."
The speedy Robinson ran for
1,702 yards in his breakout 2010
season under Rodriguez and
passed for another 2,750 yards,
throwing for 18 touchdowns and
scrambling for another 14 scores.
"Anyone who knows Denard
knows he can throw the ball,"
Howard said. "What happens is,
a lot of people, especially in the
media, get so wowed by his speed
... but there's much more to him ...
He's very serious about becoming
a pro-style quarterback.
"There's no doubt in my mind,
that kid can spit the rock, he can
spit the pill. Just gotta give him
the opportunity to. But, for me, it
starts with the footwork."

While that footwork will be
paramount for the junior quar-
terback, he can always ad lib that
footwork and tear out of the pock-
et to pick up yardage on the run.
"Obviously they're going to
have to work in some other pack-
ages to utilize the things that give
defensive coordinators night-
mares, which is Denard with a
ball in his hands running," How-
ard said.
Howard said his first experi-
ence meeting Robinson was at the
2009 Michigan football Spring
Game, when early-enrollee quar-
terback Tate Forcier put on the
pads for the first time and Robin-
son looked on from the sidelines.
Robinson showed his high
school status as he strode the side-
line with a red and yellow varsity
jacket from Deerfield Beach High
School.
But his trip home is where he
made his mark with a Michigan

legend.
Howard walked through
Detroit Metro Airport awaiting
his flight to Miami and realized
that Robinson was set to climb
aboard the same flight home to
Florida.
"Denard could've been a guy
who ran a 5.1 40(-meter split), I
didn't know anything about this
kid," Howard recalls. "We just sat
in the airport and talked. That's
when I realized what type of kid
he was - he was really humble,
really nice."
"His smile, the way he handled
himself, the way he interacted
with me ... he's the type of kid who
you want to see do well.
They really are similar, eh?
"Since then, everyone's called
us twins."
The brilliant smile and blazing
speed match. But Denard doesn't
have a Heisman Trophy in his
hands - not yet, at least.

The fanciful world that Harry .Pot-

to is under siege.
Lord Voldermort is not the only

really, the end of what? The last

Summer strong 'Suits'

ers and trailers.
This movie-going
experience is even better when the
film, "Horrible Bosses" in this case,
is delightfully funny, original and
entertaining to the last pre-credits
bloopers footage.
Chronicling the story of three
men, Nick (Jason Bateman, "Cou-
ples Retreat"), Dale (Charlie Day,
"It's Always Sunny in Philadel-
phia") and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis,
"Saturday Night Live") and their
unfortunate work situations, "Hor-

with a storyline that could have
easily failed. Where the film suc-
ceeds is in the impeccable cast-
ing and the fresh lines - however
annoying Day's characteristically
high-pitched voice is at times.
What could have been a bland, pre-
dictable story actually turns out to
be intriguing and unexpected.
When their superiors finally -
and hilariously - cross the line
for the last time, the three leading
men decide that enough is enough.
Seeking out the help of Dean
"Motherfucker" Jones, a thug-
wannabe played by Jamie Foxx,
the men try to settle on a method to
achieve their ultimate goal: quiet,
permanent disposal of their hor-
rible bosses. The ensuing action is
" refreshing and definitely not in the
style of standard fart joke comedy.

With a multitude of original
lines nearly rivaling those found in
other funny-guy movies like "The
Hangover," the characters involved
take this refreshing script and run
with it. The script itself is certainly
well thought-out - there are none
of the standard plot holes or any of
the usual unanswered questions
along the lines of "wait, why didn't
they just ... " Coupled with strong
leading male and female roles, the
script and storyline are strong.
Jennifer Aniston ("Just Go With
It") plays a dentist with a hilarious
sexual fixation on her assistant,
Dale. Between her riotously inap-
propriate in-office remarks and her
desire to take advantage of Dale
before his impending marriage,
Aniston occupies the skin of a char-
acter she has little experience with,
but manages to rock.
More than just
fart jokes.
Kevin Spacey ("The Men Who
Stare at Goats"), on the other hand,
plays a character who embodies
pure evil in a suit. He is manipula-
tive, greedy and horrible to his wife
and employees. He is deliciously
detestable, but viewers will cer-
tainly appreciate his believability
compared to Colin Farrell's ("Crazy
Heart") performance as Bobby
Pellitt. Maddeningly ignorant,
Farrell's cokehead character is off-
the-charts ridiculous, yet wildly
entertaining.
"Horrible Bosses" is one of those

es. It's refreshing, entertaining and

is funny and the whole film is filled
with hidden gems of quotable lines
and amusing situations.

University launches
new online directory

ITS aims to increase
security, simplicity
with MCommunity
By BETHANY BIRON
Editor in Chief
As part of the quest to increase
security and transparency in the
directory system, members of
the University's Information and
Technology Services team imple-
mented MCommunity, a new sys-
tem that launches today.
Accordingto Janet Eaton, ITS
communication documentation
lead for MCommunity, the pro-
gram serves as an "identity man-
agement system" that will replace
the old University's Online Direc-
tory and provide a more modern
interface to search for information
on University affiliates.
"It will provide easier access
to the directory information,"
Eaton said. "It will be easier to find
people in groups and it will even-
tually be used for provisioning of
computing services to students,
staff and faculty so that people get
the appropriate access to the ser-
vices they need."
John Gohsman, executive
director of the NextGen program
office - an internet technol-
ogy program that aims to advance
computing services for Univer-
sity members - echoed Eaton's
sentiment and said implementing
MCommunity will be "a really
easy transition" for students and
provide a simpler forum for Uni-
versity members seeking contact
information.
"(It will have) better usabil-
ity, better accessibility for stu-
dents with disabilities and there
are some other things planned
that I think will benefit students
down the road, but I think those
will probably be transparent to
students as well as it goes to the
point of provisioning computing
resources," Gohsman said.
As part of their initiative to
make the directory more user
friendly, Dana Fair, web market-
ing and communications specialist
at the University, said ITS engaged
with groups on campus to garner
feedback about how they would
like the program changed.
"In the onset (ITS) had input

from students so they were able
to get their feedback before they
actually moved into this," Fair
said. "Students were actually able
to say what they wanted."
According to Gohsman, devel-
opment of the program originally
started in the fall, but design work
started before then as part of the
University's plan to update the
older interface, which was origi-
nally created in the 1990s.
In addition to providing easier
accessibility for students, the Uni-
versity aims to increase privacy for
students by hiding home addresses
and phone numbers by default and
instead having students and fac-
ulty members enter this informa-
tion themselves, which is different
from the old system.
Gohsman said the updated
service will also automatically
remove non-affiliates from the
directory by utilizing human
resources and alumni systems
to ensure that only true Univer-
sity members can use computing
resources. However, it will pro-
vide a sponsor system that will
allow people who aren't a part of
the University "through normal
channels" to receive access, such
as visitinglecturers.
He added identity manage-
ment has been particularly dif-
ficult for institutions of higher
education as opposed to the cor-
porate world since often time pro-
fessionals and students come from
all over the nation for brief peri-
ods of times to engage in research
endeavors.
"Our researchers interact with ,
a lot of researchers from other
institutions, so it brings in some
different challenges around affili-
ation," Gohsman said.
He added this has been a
problem plaguing much of higher
education, and the University has
been collaborating with other uni-
versities to pursue the best meth-
od of action.
"Higher education has been
grappling with this issue and
we're part of a number of con-
sortiums across higher education
trying to think about this," he
said. "So we've been working with
(universities) extensively on this
over the years to the point we're
implementing (identity manage-
ment programs) a little bit quicker
than others."
