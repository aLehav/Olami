On a Monday afternoon 

in late October, Ann Arbor 
resident Brian Young and his 
girlfriend drove up to a house 
on State Street across the street 
from Yost Ice Arena. Young 
had driven by the property 
a few days prior and noticed 
a sign that read “Rooms for 
Rent/No Lease.” He was on 
the search for a new home and 
the sign immediately caught 
his attention.

It was not the first time 

Young looked to rent a room 
without a lease. Growing up 
in Detroit and Ypsilanti, he 
said the no-lease, rental rooms 

phenomena 
was 
somewhat 

common. 
In 
the 
state 
of 

Michigan, landlords are not 
required to provide a written 
lease if the tenant is renting 
month-to-month 
for 
less 

than one year, although the 
agreement can be terminated 
with 30 days notice.

Having 
had 
good 

experiences in the past, Young 
decided to give the house a shot 
and take a tour. The liability 
of not having a written lease 
didn’t bother him.

“I feel like it wouldn’t 

be smart for somebody to 
jeopardize (their) business,” 
Young 
said. 
“To 
mistreat 

people 
or 
do 
somebody 

wrong. So I kind of overlook 

Youngju 
Ryu, 
Institute 

for the Humanities Hunting 
Family Faculty Fellow and 
associate professor of Asian 
Languages 
and 
Cultures, 

spoke 
to 
approximately 

40 students and faculty in 
Osterman 
Common 
Room 

Tuesday afternoon about the 
role of new media in South 
Korea’s protest culture.

The talk was part of the 

FellowSpeak series, a program 
allowing faculty and visiting 
fellows to discuss their area of 
study outside the classroom.

Ryu discussed the history 

of political activism in South 
Korea and the relatively new 
influence of cultural texts in 
helping citizens be informed 
and mobilized, specifically 
in regards to the transition of 
power in South Korea in 2017.

“It 
was 
all 
very, 
very 

peaceful and was celebrated 
by press around the world,” 
Ryu said. “An example of 
very robust people’s power 
and democracy at a time 
when there is so much hand-
wringing over the crisis on 
liberal democracy around the 
world and the rise of corrosive 
nationalism in those parts of 
the world where we are used 
to thinking about democracy.”

In May 2017, South Koreans 

voted a new president into 
office after the impeachment 
of Park Geun-hye on charges 

of 
political 
corruption. 

Dubbed 
the 
Candlelight 

Revolution, the shift toward 
democracy was a result of 
street demonstrations.

Scholars, including Ryu, 

credit 
the 
spark 
of 
the 

Candlelight 
Revolution 
to 

new media types, specifically 
the podcast. South Korean 
government mass censorship 
skipped 
over 
podcasts, 

meaning 
the 
people 
had 

more access to unregulated 
information and news than 
ever before. This, in turn, 
energized 
the 
people 
of 

South Korea and lead to the 
formation of “poli-tainment,” 
the 
practice 
of 
bringing 

politics into entertainment 
programs.

Business 
freshman 

Madeline Adler said she was 
interested in the talk because 
of its focus on how media 
engages citizens in politics.

“I’ve always been interested 

in program politics, especially 
things like this, how digital 
media gets people involved 
in their politics more,” Adler 
said. “I was really interested 
in her talk about accessibility 
and just talking about how 
the use of podcasts and satire 
are 
making 
politics 
more 

accessible 
to 
people 
and 

making 
people 
understand 

their politics more.”

Noah Bland, an Institute 

for the Humanities fellow, 
introduced 
Ryu 
at 
the 

event. Bland said this talk 
had a bigger turnout than 
similar events and noted her 

expertise in the area of study 
and her book, “Writers of the 
Winter Republic.”

“A 
few 
days 
before 

Thanksgiving 
break, 
we 

appreciate 
this 
enormous, 

huge crowd. It’s wonderful,” 
Bland said. “Her areas of 
research include aesthetics 
of 
dissidence, 
cultures 

of 
authoritarianism 
and 

philosophies of reconciliation 
in 20th-century Korea.”

Ryu 
said 
there 
was 

significant 
movement 
in 

two areas in recent history: 
K-Protests, 
a 
form 
of 

grassroots political activism, 
and K-Pop. Protestors weaved 
elements of K-Pop into the 
revolution’s message.

During 
the 
Candlelight 

Lou Anna Simon, former 

president of Michigan State 
University, was charged on 
Tuesday 
by 
the 
Michigan 

Attorney General’s Office for 
lying to police regarding the 
investigation of Larry Nassar, 
former USA Gymnastics and 
MSU doctor.

Simon 
was

came forward accusing him of

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | NOVEMBER 21, 2018


According to a court opinion 

filed Monday, a federal judge 
ruled professors undergoing 
trial 
for 
accusations 
of 

misconduct have the right to 
cross-examine 
accusers 
— 

particularly if defendants face 
serious disciplinary actions.

In September, the U.S. Court 

of Appeals ruled in Doe v. 
Baum that universities “must 
give the accused student or his 
agent an opportunity to cross-
examine the accuser” in cases 
of sexual assault investigations. 
According to the court opinion, 

the University of Michigan 
failed to comply with the 
holding that accused students 
have the opportunity to cross-
examine their accuser when 
credibility 
is 
in 
question. 

The ruling has widespread 
ramifications for the student 
sexual 
misconduct 
policy 

and hearing processes. Now, 
faculty and staff misconduct is 
under the spotlight. 

“Plaintiff 
has 
adequately 

pled that the University violated 
her Fourteenth Amendment 
rights by sanctioning her under 
SPG 201.96,” the court opinion 
reads.

The defendant in the case is 

Prof. Pamela Smock, who faced 

charges of sexual harassment 
from three graduate students, 
but was cleared of Title IX 
violations in December 2016. 
She was reported as conducting 
“inappropriate behavior,” and 
LSA Dean Andrew Martin 
stated he found this report 
“troubling” 
before 
freezing 

Smock’s salary, removing her 
sabbatical and disabling her 
role as an advisor to doctoral 
students for three years.

David Nacht, counsel for 

Smock, stated while Doe v. 
Baum 
applies 
to 
students, 

this ruling on faculty’s right 
to 
cross-examine 
accusers 

extends 
the 
previous 
case 

precedent.

“Doe v. Baum was, in 

fact, a student case, but 
the logic of the opinion 
doesn’t necessarily limit 
itself to that, and so the 
judge was guided by that 
precedent in making his 
decision,” 
Nacht 
said. 

“Why should a freshman 
in college have more due 
process rights if they’re 
facing 
suspension, 
for 

instance, than a tenured 
professor who is accused 
of the same conduct, or 
similar conduct? It is not 
as if the professor has less 
at stake, so I think there’s 
an inherent logic to the 
court’s decision.”

A press release from 

Nacht argues the opinion 
from the federal court 
also applies to professors 
accused of bullying under 
SPG 201.96, which is the 
University’s anti-bullying 
rule 
for 
professors, 

and 
discrimination 

or 
harassment. 
In 

Smock’s case, the press 
release states she was 
not 
given 
the 
names 

of her accusers nor was she 
allowed to question them. 
The court opinion maintains, 
however, Smock did not make 
an 
adequate 
constitutional 

challenge to SPG 201.96, nor 
did she adequately plead that 
her 
“sanctions 
constituted 

retaliation against her exercise 
of protected speech.”

Nacht voiced his support 

for the recent ruling, stating 
individuals should be given 
the right to cross-examine 
accusers.

“I think generally we’re 

having a very un-nuanced 
debate in this country about 
investigations and accusations 
… 
When 
you 
empower 

investigators to make decisions 
that have the power to destroy 
someone’s 
reputation 
and 

you deprive the person being 
accused of fundamental rights 
to challenge the accuser, then 
you inevitably result in some 
people who are accused and 
innocent being found guilty,” 
Nacht said. “We’ve known for 
a long time how important 
cross-examination is. It is 
not progressive or liberal or 
decent to prevent people who 
are accused from defending 
themselves.”

CHANGING ME DIA APPROACHES

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: HUNDREDS ATTEND ASSEMBLY TEACH-IN ON 
DEPUTIZATION, ACTIVISM

By Jon Casden
Students who spent last week 

shouting “No Guns, No Cops, No 
Code,” quelled their chants to speak 
on the issue of campus deputization 
yesterday at a Michigan Student 
Assembly-sponsored teach-in.

Event organizers estimated more 

than 1,000 people attended the 
teach-in held during the day at the 
Michigan Union.

Faculty and student speakers 

addressed deputization as well as 
the installation of a non-academic 
code of conduct, and the conflict in 
the Persian Gulf.

The largest crowd of the day 

was drawn by Michigan Student 
Assembly 
representative 
and 

Student Rights Committee Chair 
Corey Dolgon, who discussed the 
deputization issue in front of an 

estimated 350 people.

Dolgon emphasized the need 

for the administration to listen to 
students’ concerns and to put funds 
into improving safety in other ways 
on campus.

Students and speakers at the 

teach-in 
encouraged 
people 

to become involved with the 
movement and to press for student 
input into other decisions at the 
University.

“Our goals have broadened, now 

we believe that every student group 
that has demands has the right to 
negotiate those demands with the 
University,” said Carl Burns, LSA 
senior.

Smaller 
seminars 
informed 

students about the development 
of social movements, and how 
they related to the current state 

of activism. Another discussion 
focused on student apathy.

The 
teach-in 
also 
featured 

discussions on homeless people and 
their relationships with police, on 
women and police and on how the 
University administration operates. 

“I was never really previously 

concerned with the student rights 
movement,” said LSA first-year-
student Pete Kroll. “I’m here to get 
more informed. I read a lot and hear 
a lot (about deputization), but until 
I’m informed, I can’t get involved.”

LSA sophomore Lisa Yanoff had 

similar reasons for attending.

“As far as student rights is 

concerned, 
I 
have 
not 
done 

anything and I wanted to come here 
to see what was going on. Now, I’m 
definitely for (the anti-deputization 
movement),” Yanoff said.

Court rules faculty can cross-examine 
accuser in sexual misconduct cases

JORDYN BAKER
Daily News Reporter

I think generally 
we’re having a 

very un-nuanced 

debate in this 
country about 
investigations

Court of Appeals ruling follows suit on Doe vs. Baum case from September


The University of Michigan 

Central 
Student 
Government 

passed 
multiple 
resolutions 

Tuesday 
evening, 
including 

amendments to the Statement 
of 
Students 
Rights 
and 

Responsibilities 
regarding 

medical amnesty for all ages of 
students and more substances 
than alcohol, as well as a new 
definition of “hazing.” In the 
current 
statement, 
medical 

amnesty 
is 
only 
applicable 

to minors and when under 
the influence of alcohol. This 
resolution aims to expand the 
definition to encompass other 
substances as well as people of 
any age.

As of October 2016, the 

Michigan 
Medical 
Amnesty 

Law was expanded to include 
any controlled substance and 
apply to individuals of any age. 
Rackham 
student 
Nicholas 

Fadanelli, one of the authors of 
the resolution, expressed the 
importance of the resolution 
and 
was 
extremely 
pleased 

the resolution passed at the 
meeting. Fadanelli also said 
he and the other authors of the 
resolution were surprised these 
protections were not aligned 
with the state law already.

“I 
am 
very 
excited 
that 

CSG has agreed to author this 
amendment … because I think it 
is very important that we extend 
these protections to students 
who have consumed drugs that 
are not alcohol that need medical 

attention,” Fadanelli said. “The 
fact that this is not currently 
protected under University of 
Michigan policies is a big shock 
for me and other authors, and we 
are very gracious for the support 
that the other members of CSG 
and the members of SACUA and 
other administrators have given 
us thus far in the process.”

Other 
resolutions 
passed 

put forth a request to the 
University to create a concrete 
definition of hazing in the 
Statement of Students Rights 
and Responsibilities. In the 
resolution, the authors stated 
in 
the 
current 
statement, 

the definition of hazing is 
hyperlinked 
with 
references 

to 
‘Campus 
Community 

Perspectives,’ 
‘University 

Policies’ and ‘Michigan State 
Law.’

“The lack of a definition for 

hazing leaves unclear how the 
Statement will be interpreted,” 
the 
Hazing 
Statement 

Amendment Resolution read. 
“The ‘University Policy Against 
Hazing,’ last updated 2 April 
2004, remains the basis for 
current policy, yet is insufficient 
to match the contemporary 
needs of our student body by 
failing to explicitly define and 
condemn acts of hazing.”

Both 
amendments 
to 
the 

statement will be sent to the 
Students 
Relations 
Advisory 

Committee of the Faculty Senate 
to be reviewed.

Revolution, Ryu said people 
were coming up with new 
slogans and artwork for their 
protests 
based 
on 
global 

popular culture. Ryu also said 
one podcast in particular, “I 

Am a Petty Cheat,” had a large 
impact on generating interest 
in the revolution.

Throughout 
the 
event, 

Ryu emphasized the peaceful 
nature 
of 
the 
Candlelight 

Revolution. She attributed this 
as an explicit shift toward a 
new era for South Korea and is 
hopeful this trend will change 
the country’s diplomacy in the 
future.

 “The fact that it was 

peaceful — not a single window 
was broken — even though 
some 16 million people came 
out on the streets was itself 
also a departure and paradigm 
shift from earlier histories 
of 
more 
violent 
protests,” 

Ryu said. “It brought about a 
complete change in the way 
South Korea has engaged with 
North Korea and a possible 
path to ending the Korean War 
that now seems to be a real 
prospect.”

anger.

Other 
prominent 
figures 

associated 
with 
MSU 
and 

USA 
Gymnastics 
were 

arrested 
earlier 
this 
year 

in the wake of the Nassar 
scandal. Steve Penny, former 
chief executive officer of USA 
Gymnastics, was arrested in 
October for tampering with 

evidence. Kathie Klages, former 
gymnastics coach of MSU, was 
arrested for lying to police. 
William Strampel, former dean 
of MSU College of Osteopathic 
Medicine, 
was 
arrested 
in 

March regarding his handling 
of the Nassar investigation.

Lindsey Lemke, a survivor 

and 
former 
Michigan 

State gymnast, wrote in a 
Twitter statement that she 
is not surprised by Simon’s 
arrest, and sees it as taking a 
step forward toward holding 

enablers 
of 
sexual 
abuse 

accountable.

“She knew all along that 

Nassar should not have been 
treating us but yet she chose 
not to do the right thing and 
continued to employ Nassar at 
Michigan State University,” the 
statement 
said. 
“When 
I 

confronted Lou Anna in the 
court 
sentencing 
of 
Larry 

Nassar, she had no answers, 
she didn’t know who I was, and 
she proved that she was unfit 
to be in the position she was 

in … this serves as a statement 
that we are continuing to hold 
our fight and that we are not 
backing down until all enablers 
are held accountable for their 
poor actions.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Morgan 

McCaul, 
also 
a 
survivor, 

echoed Lemke’s sentiment that 
these charges represent an 
important moment of increased 
accountability regarding the 
Michigan 
State 
University 

administration, 
as 
well 
as 

justice for survivors.

“Her 
charges 
mark 
a 

significant 
moment 
in 
the 

course of this story, one where 
enablers of sexual violence 
begin to face accountability 
for their failure to ensure the 
safety of those they were legally 
responsible to protect. This has 
been a long time coming, but it 
is one more long-sought step 
towards collective justice,” she 
said.

She 
further 
recalled 
the 

hearings last January, in which 
Judge 
Rosemarie 
Aquilina 

garnered 
national 
acclaim 

for her empathetic support of 
the “sister survivors.” 

“Back in January, I asked 

Judge Aquilina to impose a 
sentence upon my abuser that 
would send an unmistakable 
message to those who ‘look 
the 
other 
way 
to 
protect 

their 
green-and-white,’” 

she said. “Today, that feels 
realized.”

it, because I feel like people 
should be about they business 
more than trying to trick 
somebody or get over them. If 
there ain’t no lease, then I’ll 
take a chance because I feel like 
they wouldn’t jeopardize they 
business to do me wrong.”

The owner of the house on 

State Street, who also owns the 
Campus Student Bike Shop on 
Maynard Street, declined to 
comment.

Young, 
a 
gregarious 

grandfather, moved to Ann 
Arbor in 1989 for a better life. He 
works part-time as a custodian 
and receives disability benefits 
for a leg injury.

“I haven’t seen an abandoned 

building here since I’ve been 
here and I’ve never heard no 
gunshots,” Young said. “I feel 
like this is a good place for me. 
The cost of living is high, but 
there’s jobs here, so you can 
afford to live here. I just like 
Ann Arbor. The atmosphere, 
it’s a walking, running, talking, 
active town. The future is 
bright for me here. I tell my 
friends and people that wanna 
have something in life, that 
want to enjoy life, come to Ann 
Arbor.”

While Young said he has 

never experienced any issues 
with no-lease rentals, those 
familiar 
with 
affordable 

housing policy in Ann Arbor 
still caution against it.

Zack Ackerman, Ann Arbor 

City Councilmember, D-Ward 
3, 
strongly 
advises 
against 

entering into a rental agreement 
without a lease. The liability, he 
said, is too great. And while the 
flexibility of no-lease renting 
may be attractive to tenants 
without dependable streams 
of 
income, 
Ackerman 
said 

it’s not a solution to the lack 
of affordable housing in Ann 

Arbor “by any means.”

“I think it’s a profiteering 

band-aid 
to 
the 
affordable 

housing issue. Leases mostly 
exist to protect tenants’ rights,” 
Ackerman said. “And if a tenant 
is entering in a relationship 
with a landlord without a 
lease, they’re entering into it 
without any right whatsoever, 
which means any personal 
property they bring into the 
property, they’d have no proof 
it’s their own. And the landlord 
or any other tenant could lay 
claim to it, and the original 
tenant would have no legal 
recourse whatsoever. So this 
is an extremely dangerous 
proposition for a tenant, and I 
would strongly not recommend 
any tenant enter into it unless 
they’re in desperate enough 

straits.”

LSA 
senior 
Christopher 

Olson, 
co-president 
of 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

Roosevelt 
Institute 
–– 
a 

student-run, progressive think 
tank and advocacy organization 
–– said the phenomenon is 
a symptom of the affordable 
housing problem in Ann Arbor 
and similarly cautions renting 
without a lease puts tenants at 
the whims of their landlord. 
Rents have risen steadily in 
Ann Arbor in last decade — 
the median rate for rent in Ann 
Arbor increased 14 percent 

from 2010 to 2015 reaching 
$1,075 
per 
month, 
despite 

the amount of high-density 
housing areas also rising by 32 
percent.

“I would think that (month-

to-month rentals) are more 
of a symptom of the fact 
that we have an affordable 
housing problem here,” Olson 
said. “Leases provide legal 
protections to tenants in a 
number of ways. They have to 
give you notice of entry, they 
have to fix the stuff that you ask 
them to fix. Not having a lease 
puts you more at the discretion 
of the landlord.”

Gayle 
Rosen, 
a 
lawyer 

with Student Legal Services, 
the 
University’s 
law 
office 

for 
students, 
said 
verbal 

agreements between a tenant 
and landlord can be legally 
binding, if they meet certain 
criteria, though she “certainly 
wouldn’t recommend” it.

“You have to agree to certain 

terms in order to have a valid 
verbal agreement,” Rosen said. 
“You have to agree on the rent 
amount and the length of time 
that you’re going to be there, 
but it could just become a 
month-to-month lease, where 
each month the other party 
gives notice that they were 
terminating the lease, that 
it continues. It’s effectively 
a verbal agreement, a verbal 
lease.”

According 
to 
Rosen, 

University 
students 
almost 

always sign leases and she does 
not often see cases of disputes 
between tenants and landlords 
without a lease.

“I don’t see it frequently,” 

Rosen 
said. 
“I’ve 
seen 
it 

probably less than five times. 
Sometimes 
they’re 
sublease 

situations, 
where 
someone 

wants to sublease and they 
do that without a written 
agreement and that’s a little 
bit more common. Why they 
do it, I don’t know. In some 

instances it might be they never 
got around to signing a lease. 
I certainly don’t think it’s a 
preferred option because the 
lease is a little bit unclear.”

Students and Ann Arbor 

residents alike have mobilized 
this year to revive the Ann 
Arbor 
Tenants’ 
Union, 

which shut down in 2004 due 
to lack of funding. Students 
were 
then 
redirected 
to 

Student Legal Services for 
mediation and legal assistance. 
Last month at a Central Student 
Government meeting, however, 
SLS director Doulgas Lewis 
said he’d like to see the union 
in action again. 

“The tenants’ union helped 

a lot of things happen in 
government 
in 
this 
town 

that wouldn’t have happened 
without it,” Lewis said at the 
meeting. “I think their last shot 
was trying to get rent control in 
Ann Arbor.”

In the end, Young and his 

girlfriend did not rent the space. 
The room in question was $600 
per month with a bathroom 
and access to a kitchen and 
living room, but Young did not 
feel the space was an adequate 
return for the rent.

Young 
said 
his 
past 

experiences 
have 
led 
him 

to trust his landlords. He 
would, however, like a written 
agreement stating his security 
deposit is refundable.

“I’ve done it before in the 

past and never had no problems. 
But I feel like you ought to 
have something written out 
to give me so you can let me 
know that I’ll be assured I 
can get my security deposit 
back,” Young said. “We be on 
even playing fields. Because 
(the landlord) needs a security 
deposit, to make sure his place 
won’t get damaged, and I need 
something written saying that 
I get my security deposit back if 
nothing’s damaged. And that’s 
good business.”

The Native American Student 

Association contributed eight 
turkeys to the center, where 
AIHFS staff planned to both 
deliver food and hold a feast 
Tuesday night. MESA also 
funded a community lunch 
Tuesday during which members 
of 
AIHFS 
and 
University 

students 
talked 
about 

contemporary issues affecting 
Native American communities, 
and 
especially 
students. 

These issues spanned from 
the 
increasing 
need 
for 

Native students to specialize 
in environmental preservation 
as well as maintaining cultural 
values.

Shiloh Maples, the healthy 

foods initiatives coordinator at 
AIHFS and member of the Little 
River Band of Ottawa Indians, 
highlighted the necessity for 
Native American people to 
work 
together 
to 
continue 

growth 
and 
development 

within communities.

“Native culture relies on 

interdependence 
to 
survive, 

whereas 
dominant 
culture 

really relies on independence,” 
she said. “The interdependence 
is about growing together. We 
support one another because 
our future and well-being are 
interconnected.”

Teia McGahey, a 2017 U-M 

Dearborn alum from the Ojibwe 
tribe, serves as an assistant for 
the youth program AIHFS runs 
for students in high school and 
higher education. The program 
works with young adults to 
help prepare for college or 
joining 
the 
workforce 
and 

facilitate cultural engagement. 
She stressed the importance of 
outreach for Native American 
youth and collaborations with 
the University.

“I feel like a lot of Native 

people and people from all over 

have been very disconnected 
from our culture, histories and 
ways of living, and I feel that 
it’s really important to have 
those and hold on to them, 
for anyone who wants to,” she 
said. “That’s the most fulfilling 
thing about working here, is 
being able to help be the bridge 
for people to their culture and 
where they come from. I think 
that’s very healing, and that’s 
how I see a lot of the work our 
community programs do here, 
is facilitating healing for our 
people.”

McGahey 
explained 
how 

partnership with the University 
can 
provide 
resources 
to 

educate and mobilize Native 
and non-Native students alike.

“Collaborations 
like 
this 

are so powerful because it’s 
just growing our work in so 
many different ways, it can 
be planning events, starting 
movements, 
getting 
in 
the 

social justice world in a way 
that is beneficial for us, and 
being able to collaborate totally 
increases our potential,” she 
said.

has 
spearheaded 
Native 

American 
Heritage

initiatives 
and 
explained 

how reconnecting with these

“As

MESA finds time to honor the

the day has commemorated 
the lives of many transgender 
people lost to violence and thus 
begun an important tradition 
of recognizing the many who 
fight for the rights of their 
community. 

Raivynn 
Smith, 
program 

specialist 
for 
events 
and 

partnerships at the Spectrum 
Center, 
highlighted 
the 

fears that many transgender 
individuals have of coming 
out and presenting themselves 
in the world. Smith said she 
hoped for a day when Black 
trans women could not only 
exist, but thrive, and non-
binary children could grow up 
without the fear of violence in 
their own homes. 

“Maybe one day I can wake 

up and breathe knowing that my 
community is safe. However, 
today, unfortunately, is not 
that day,” they said. “I hold my 
breath for over 350 trans and 
gender nonconforming people 
that we know of were murdered 
this year … My people are 
drowning in the ills of the 
world, drowning at the hands 
of transphobia and misogyny 
and racism and poverty and 
deep discrimination.”

Smith’s 
introduction 
was 

followed by a performance 
by the Out Loud chorus, a 
community 
chorus 
group 

dedicated 
to 
creating 
safe 

spaces for LGBTQ folks and 
their allies. The Out Loud 
Chorus is a performance group 
that uses music as an outlet and 
is a community to promote open 
environments where gender 
non-binary individuals can feel 
welcomed. 
They 
performed 

two songs that paid homage to 
the deaths of their peers and 

reflected on the power of the 
trans community. 

“We 
try 
very 
hard 
to 

get people to think about 
acceptance and LGBTQ issues 
in the general population; it’s 
part of our mission to educate 
people and hopefully reduce 
discrimination,” Tim Hamann, 
a member of Out Loud Chorus, 
said. “The way we do that is by 
changing gender pronouns in 
music, flipping things upside 
down, taking traditional songs 
and changing them.” 

The 
memorial 
concluded 

with 
the 
invited 
speaker, 

Nursing 
graduate 
student 

Vidhya 
Aravind, 
speaking 

about her narrative and the 
personal impact the memorials 
have on her every year. Aravind 
has been doing activist work 
for 
years 
to 
create 
local 

change within her immediate 
community. Aravind has led 
multiple advocacy efforts for 
trans 
students 
on 
campus 

through 
the 
Graduate 

Employee Organization and 
other channels. 

Aravind began by speaking 

about 
the 
disproportionate 

violence against trans women 
of 
color 
to 
highlight 
the 

intersections of racism, sexism, 
transphobia and homophobia. 

“It’s a full-blown crisis,” 

Aravind says. “I want to be 
clear and say that transphobia 
is a cis problem but I don’t 
know what it will take for them 
to shift their opinions on such a 
massive scale. Our bodies’ very 
existence challenge capitalist 
and colonialist structures so 
much.” 

She expressed her desire to 

focus on growing the strength 
of the trans community rather 
than trying to fight against 
the inevitable nature of cis 
mindsets. 
Such 
bottom-up 

solutions, Aravind said, are 

indicative of her acceptance of 
the structural nature of anti-
trans violence. She argued it is 
a systemic problem where anti-
trans or anti-Black thoughts 
cannot be reformed and where 
assimilation 
will 
never 
be 

enough. 

“Promises of not being the 

grotesque creatures they think 
we are continue to remain 
unheard,” Aravind said. 

She 
recognized, 
though, 

there is a future for the 
community. She said her fight is 
not against the cis community 
but rather, with the community 
of supporters and allies. She 
desires to build a world for the 
trans community rather than 
change the anti-trans world 
they live in right now. 

“I still think there’s hope 

to be had. There’s hope in a 
different world where instead 
of fighting for cishet change, 
we become a resilient enough 
community that they can’t 
touch us,” Aravind said.

The last 30 minutes of the 

memorial was open to any 
attendees to speak about their 
personal experiences. Erica, a 
member of Out Loud Chorus 
who requested her full name 
not be published, also shared 
her story. After transitioning 
at 13 and getting kicked out of 
her family’s home, she went 
years without having a proper 
community. She described her 
experience of finding herself 
through the Out Loud Chorus 
and spoke of her gratitude.

“It was the first time that 

I had a group of people who 
accepted me for who I am,” she 
said.

Aravind’s last words to the 

audience were a call to action. 

“Practice 
radical 
and 

creative compassion,” Aravind 
said. “Especially when you feel 
uncomfortable doing so.”

SPECTRUM
From Page 1A


T

he emotional arc for every 
college 
student 
seems 
to exist in a paradoxical 
state: On one hand, college is 
lauded as the best time of people’s 
lives, while on the other hand, 
college students seem to live in a 
state of existential dread about the 
future. This tension is created by 
the fact that college is essentially 
a transitional time in people’s 
lives. College students have one 
foot firmly planted in childhood, 
when the main concern in life is 
still school, while the other foot 
is in mid-air, charging towards 
the future. After all, college is 
supposed to be the time when 
people really pick what they want 
to do with their lives.
The looming question of the 
future seems to arise in every 
decision that we make. Is this 
really the thing I want to study? 
What can I do with a degree 
in this? Will I really make new 
friends after college or is my social 
life mostly downhill from here? Is 
this the last chance I have to pick 
up a new skill or hobby? (Maybe I 
should go to the next kayak club 
meeting?) Who do I want to be 
and how the hell am I going to get 
there? 
The most common way of 
discussing 
and 
dealing 
with 
this anxiety is to discuss career 
paths. If I can figure out my job, 
then I can begin to craft a vision 
of myself around that. It seems 
like, for many college students, if 
there is a specific path and vision 
of a career, then the big decisions 
made in college can be navigated 
with a greater degree of certainty 
and ease. I feel like I have heard 
people say something along the 
lines of the following a million 
times: “If I study computer 
science, get certain grades and 
get certain internships over the 
summers, then I know that I will 
be able to get a job that pays a good 
amount of money, has a workplace 

environment I like and is in a cool/
hip city.”
This 
orientation 
toward 
college, however, follows a very 
odd temporal structure. Rather 
than beginning with things that 
happened in the past, or even 
the feelings occupied in the 
present, this orientation creates 
a futuristic vision of the self 
and works backward in time 
toward the now. This process 
of prioritizing a future self over 
a current one creates a massive 
amount of accompanying anxiety 
about crafting this future self.
Don’t read me as advocating 
that students should only think 
about the present. A student 
who doesn’t create this complex 
chain of projection has anxiety 
of a different sort, an anxiety of 
the present, rather than of the 
future. For a student like myself, 
who studies philosophy, there is 
not a clear path for me into the 
working world; there is no Silicon 
Valley of philosophy. Instead 
of spending every day fearing 
I won’t reach my goals, I spend 
every day wondering what the 
hell I am actually doing. Should I 
have chosen to study something 
that will help me more in a future 
career? Could my prioritization of 
what I am doing now really just be 
a form of naivete? 
Recently, I went to my older 
brother’s Friendsgiving event, 
which featured a series of post-
college 20-something-year-olds 
who were all trying to make 
sense of post-college life. When 
this topic of conversation arose 
(namely, what the hell I plan on 
doing after college), it seemed 
that every person in the room 
quickly became an expert on the 
topic. All of my brother’s friends 
came from a place of caring, and 
they did genuinely want to share 
the knowledge they’d gained 
from their experiences with me. 
In this process of “helping” me, 

however, one thing became very 
clear to everyone in the room: 
The line between generalized 
advice and self-projection was 
thin.
In all fairness, the discussion 
we had was definitely thought-
provoking and got me thinking 
about what other conversations 
I have had about career paths. 
I quickly realized that my 
critique, 
that 
people 
were 
mainly just guiding me into an 
edited version of their path, is 
the case for most conversations 
about career paths. After all, our 
society trains people to consider 
their career above all else, so 
what advice could people really 
give me that is beyond their 
personal experiences?
To further complicate the whole 
situation, this form of projecting 
is actually what students, like 
the earlier described computer 
science student, are looking for — 
a clear, replicable path to follow. 
College students will always think 
anxiously about their future and 
seek advice that can bring release 
from this anxiety, so maybe 
what needs to change is not the 
occurrence of the conversation 
but rather how we engage in the 
conversation.
Maybe students shouldn’t be 
concerned with what specific 
things people did in their careers 
to push them “to the next level,” 
but rather what life decisions 
people 
have 
made 
that 
felt 
important. 
The 
conversation 
should expand from discussing 
the minutiae of career strategies 
to something of the larger game of 
life these decisions are occurring 
in. Instead of asking for and giving 
prescriptions, we should all be 
discussing how our life decisions 
influence 
fluctuations 
in 
our 
anxieties.

I

n the Trump era, whether to 
support Israel or not is becoming 
an increasingly partisan issue in 
American politics. Israel’s designation 
as a partisan issue has highlighted a 
bizarre association: white nationalists 
vocally 
supporting 
Israel, 
even 
calling themselves Zionists of sorts. 
Richard Spencer, in an interview 
with an Israeli journalist, called 
himself a “white Zionist” because he 
believes white people should have a 
homogenous homeland in America.
Nationalists elsewhere, like Viktor 
Orban of Hungary, who are pursuing 
highly nationalistic agendas that seek 
to exclude minorities, also support 
Israel. In a weird twist, Orban, widely 
seen as anti-Semitic, is strongly pro-
Israel. Nationalists support Israel to 
justify their own nationalist visions. 
If Israel can be a nation-state founded 
on an ethno-religious identity, then 
so too can America, or Hungary, or 
any country, pursue an exclusionary 
national identity. To some, the 
support nationalists espouse for Israel 
proves the most biting criticism of 
Israel — that its very existence as 
a Jewish majority state is racist, as 
was asserted in UN Resolution 3379 
and by the Boycott, Divestment and 
Sanctions movement. That is, Israel’s 
existence as a Jewish state is racist 
and colonialist in the same way 
Richard Spencer’s call for America to 
be a white homeland is racist.
However, this criticism of Israel 
is flawed. Zionism is fundamentally 
different 
than 
the 
prejudicial 
nationalisms of far-right movements 
all around the world. Zionism 
emerged as a solution to anti-
Semitism, and today it is the best 
and only solution to anti-Semitism. 
There is a clear difference between 
Jews wanting a state as a source of 
sanctuary and defense against anti-
Semitism and the racist visions of 
Richard Spencer.
Zionism was a response to the 
very European nationalism and 
anti-Semitism 
which 
nationalists 
like Orban and Richard Spencer 
echo today. In the 1800s, Jews were 
emancipated in parts of Western 
Europe, meaning they were given 
citizenship and rights for the first time 
after a long history of persecution. 
In Eastern Europe, Jews were not 
emancipated and suffered violent 
pogroms and attacks. Emancipation 
in countries like France gave Jews 
hope that if they were assimilated 
they would not be persecuted. 
Theodor Herzl, seen as the founder of 
modern Zionism, originally thought 
the solution to anti-Semitism was for 
Jews to be baptized like Christians 
were.

But it was the infamous Dreyfus 
affair, when a French Jewish military 
officer was wrongly blamed for 
treason because he was Jewish, that 
changed Herzl’s mind. Herzl, after 
witnessing anti-Semitic mobs in the 
streets of Paris, realized the Jews 
could not count on assimilation to 
protect them from anti-Semitism. 
This was proven to be true when 
the Nazis committed genocide and 
murdered two-thirds of European 
Jewry, regardless of if they were 
assimilated or not.
Anti-Semitism is not a matter of 
the past. In 2014, the Anti-Defamation 
League concluded that 26 percent 
of the world’s population held anti-
Semitic beliefs. Anti-Semitism is on 
the rise in both Europe and America, 
the places where the most Jews live 
outside of Israel. Rising anti-Semitism 
has been a concern in Europe for 
a while now. What is new is the 
rising anti-Semitism in America. As 
political scientist Fareed Zakaria said, 
“For over 2,500 years Jews have been 
vilified and persecuted everywhere, 
and then came Israel and America.”
Yet, anti-Semitic hate crimes 
in America are up 57 percent and 
half of all religious hate crimes are 
against Jews, despite Jews making up 
under two percent of the American 
population. A neo-Nazi running for 
Congress in Illinois won 26 percent of 
the vote. And of course, there was the 
Pittsburgh shooting. America might 
still overall be a safe place for Jews, 
but the fact that the Holocaust started 
in Germany — then considered one 
of the least anti-Semitic European 
countries — should serve as a 
reminder that anti-Semitism can 
emerge in deadly form anywhere.
Anti-Semitism has staying power 
because of its historic prevalence in 
European thought. Anti-Semitism 
developed as a sort of ideological 
means of scapegoating and opposing 
perceived 
change 
in 
European 
societies. In “The Protocols of the 
Elders of Zion,” an infamous anti-
Semitic text published by Russian 
military officers in the early 1900s, 
Jews are blamed for all “ideas” 
which challenged the Tsar. Jews 
in Europe were depicted as being 
the progenitors of capitalism and 
communism, depending on which 
system the bigot disliked. That’s 
why anti-Semites today, like the 
Pittsburgh shooter, blame Jews for 
whatever changes in society they 
dislike, whether its refugees or 
globalization. The white nationalists 
in Charlottesville chanted “Jews will 
not replace us,” alleging that Jews 
were conspiring to replace white 
people with minorities. Having a 

country where Jews have the right 
to live and defend themselves is 
necessary to ensure the continuity of 
Judaism, given the brutal history and 
continuity of anti-Semitism.
Zionists today should remember 
that Zionism was originally an 
instrument against anti-Semitism, 
rather than an end in and of itself. 
Religious Zionism and expansionism 
stray from Zionism’s original moral 
justifications. Zionism should not be a 
fixed ideology unable to change in the 
future. If animosity between Israelis 
and Palestinians abated significantly, a 
binational state in which Palestinians 
and Israelis are equal citizens could 
be congruous with Zionism’s goal 
of ensuring the survival of Judaism. 
Both Palestinians and Israelis could 
have the right of return. Governance 
could be structured in a power-
sharing agreement or a confederate 
system. But today, a binational state 
would mean more bloodshed and 
suffering for both sides. The conflict, 
for which both sides share blame, 
has produced an animus on the part 
of Israelis and Palestinians which 
would take generations to heal. A 
two-state solution, for now, is thus the 
best option.
Criticisms of policies by the Israeli 
government like settlements are totally 
valid and necessary. But the volume 
and intensity of Israel criticism often 
reflects or is directly motivated by the 
idea that Israel’s very existence is racist 
and illegitimate. There is a panoply of 
situations similar to Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. None of them elicit outrage 
or concern in any way comparable to 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These 
situations include but are not limited to: 
China and the Tibetans and Uighurs, 
Morocco and West Saharans, Turkey 
and the Kurds and the Sinhalese 
and Tamils. Yet, there are no calls to 
boycott these countries, nor are there 
professors denying students letters of 
recommendation to these countries 
for political reasons. People single out 
Israel as a racist, colonialist state while 
ignoring the three two-state offers the 
Israeli government has made in the last 
20 years.
In an age of “alternatives truths” 
there is a lot to be upset about. We 
should be careful how we spend 
our attention and outrage. Taking 
the bait white nationalists lay out — 
and Israel’s harshest critics ascribe 
to — of equating Zionism with the 
exclusionary nationalist visions of 
white supremacists would be a huge 
mistake.

T

he ideology of moral 
relativism is a common 
theme among today’s 
college-aged youth. 
Phrases 
such 
as 
“live 
your 
truth” 
as well as maxims 
that 
prioritize 
individuality, 
autonomy and self 
definition above all 
other values have 
swept youth culture. 
This philosophy has 
been largely painted 
in a positive light as 
the philosophy of diversity and 
inclusion, a philosophy that 
finally allows for every person 
to truly be themself, and it is 
largely associated with the 
political left. Yet this ideology 
of moral relativism could have 
dangerous consequences that 
affect the very moral fiber of 
society. In a culture where 
there is no objective truth, 
and everybody is free to define 
what is right for themselves, 
where do we end up? If we 
draw moral relativism out 
to 
its 
logical 
conclusion, 
any number of frightening 
possibilities become a reality.
My peers exemplify moral 
relativism 
when 
they 
say 
things 
such 
as: 
“I 
don’t 
believe we can define the 
truth,” “everything we think 
we know is nothing more than 
a social construct” or “our 
experiences are all individual 
and therefore none of us has 
the right to judge anyone else’s 
decisions.” These such beliefs 
have led them to conclude that 
there are in fact no objective 
truths and that there is not 
an objective morality; “live 
and let live,” as the old saying 
goes.
While, on its face, this 
ideology seems harmless and 
maybe even admirable, there 
are some deep issues that can 
arise in a world where we tell 
everyone that the only person 
they are accountable to is 
themself. When one applies 
this ideology to simple things 
such as how to dress or what 
to eat, maybe it is harmless. 
However, when we apply this 
ideology 
to 
greater 
moral 
debates, we see that it falls flat. 
Let’s take the infamous case 
of Rachel Dolezal, the white 
woman who became the head 
of the Spokane chapter of the 
NAACP by claiming she was 
Black. Few people feel that it 
was OK for her to appropriate 
Black culture the way that she 
did, but if we believe that the 
only person who can define 
what is right or wrong for 
her life is herself, then who 
are we to judge? Maybe she 
can “identify” as Black as 
she so claims. Maybe then, 
when it suits us, we all can 
identify as whatever we like. 
She claims her ethnic identity 
isn’t harming anyone else, and 
while there are arguments 
to be made to the contrary, 
in a world where we claim 
morality is relative anyway, 
then who can truly condemn 

her? If we believe there is no 
objective morality, and no 
objective truths such as one’s 
biological ethnicity, 
then 
condemning 
anyone for ethnic 
or 
cultural 
appropriation 
becomes 
a 
hypocritical 
and 
moot point. In a 
world where there is 
no truth, there is no 
right or wrong.
The truth is that 
while 
our 
youth 
are constantly saying things 
like “live your truth,” they 
aren’t living up to the true 
meaning 
of 
that 
ideology. 
They 
aren’t 
condoning 
all 
sorts of previously condemned 
actions such as the racial 
appropriation 
mentioned 
above. They are, if anything, 
more polarized and critical 
than ever. As a society, we 
are 
constantly 
condemning 
our political adversaries as 
“immoral,” and I can’t help 
but note the inconsistency 
of 
these 
two 
competing 

ideologies that are attempting 
to coexist side by side on the 
liberal side of the aisle. My 
friend might tell me to live 
my individual truth when we 
disagree on something they 
deem insignificant and, in the 
next breath, tell me that my 
pro-life stance is “morally” 
harmful to women.
The objective truth is that 
inherently 
we 
all 
believe 
in some measure of right 
or wrong, which comes out 
in the form of the truth 
claims we make on a day-
to-day basis. No matter how 
philosophical we attempt to 
be, or how much we attempt 
to understand the complexity 
of the human experience, we 
know that there are objective 
truths, and this is a good 
thing. When young liberals 
and/or Democrats claim to 
believe in moral relativism, 
they undermine their claims 
to being the party of human 
rights 
and 
social 
justice, 
because if morality, dignity 
and equality aren’t inherent 
qualities that we all possess, 
and are nothing more than a 
social construct, then they 
really don’t exist at all! They 
are as fragile as the whims 
of our culture. If tomorrow 
somebody 
comes 
to 
me 
claiming that “women belong 
in the kitchen,” I can’t tell 
them this is a backwards and 
oppressive ideology because 
that is their truth. There is no 

oppression in a world without 
truth because oppression can 
only occur when somebody’s 
freedom, dignity and equality 
are being infringed upon. If 
these are nothing more than 
relative 
social 
constructs, 
however, then the “oppressor” 
can simply claim his actions 
exist within the realms of his 
version of the truth and are 
therefore morally permissible. 
In fact, this is almost exactly 
what the Nazi lawyers tried to 
claim in the Nuremberg trials, 
that they were just living out 
the ideology of their cultural 
beliefs 
and 
therefore, 
the 
rest of the world could not 
condemn them.
It 
may 
be 
convenient 
to 
claim 
that 
truth 
is 
relative in an increasingly 
politically-correct collegiate 
environment, 
where 
safe 
spaces and trigger warnings 
are common talking points, 
but if the left wants to cling 
to moral relativism, then 
they will have to learn to 
let their “safe spaces” go, 
because on a campus where 
any truth, any conspiracy 
theory and any wild claim 
is true as long as I believe 
it is, then there are no safe 
spaces at all. Liberal colleges 
are on one hand becoming 
an 
echo 
chamber 
where 
only liberal viewpoints are 
accepted 
as 
“right” 
and 
“moral” and yet, on the other 
hand, 
these 
same 
“social 
justice warriors” are patting 
each other on the back for 
not oppressing one another 
with objective morality. It’s 
a huge hypocrisy of today’s 
new leftist movement.
While we should always be 
wary of those who attempt to 
oppress us with their versions 
of “the truth” that may not be 
decidedly true at all, if we 
believe that truth, justice and 
morality exist, we can keep 
seeking after them. We, as the 
next generation of difference 
makers, can seek to live up to 
the creed of “all men created 
equal” that is laid out in the 
U.S. Constitution. Because, 
while it may not have been 
truthfully 
fulfilled 
when 
written, due to our belief 
in the inherent dignity and 
equality of man, we can 
fight for the realization of 
this equality. However, if we 
forego morality and truth, 
we have no ground to stand 
on 
to 
fight 
for 
equality, 
justice or any other form of 
human rights. That is why 
we shouldn’t allow moral 
relativism to permeate our 
society fully. We can be more 
inclusive and tolerant than 
past 
generations 
without 
foregoing 
our 
beliefs 
in 
objective truths and morality. 
In fact, we need these beliefs 
to truly be inclusive and 
tolerant at all.

ARTIST PROFILE

‘Wildlife’ asks too much

How many of our parents’ fires 

can we be expected to put out? 
When we get close enough to 
know their fires — when we begin 
to act as their friends — do we lose 
them as parents?

Paul 
Dano’s 
contemplative 

directorial debut “Wildlife” (an 
adaptation of Richard Ford’s 
novel of the same name) engages 
with questions that shake familial 
dynamics to their core, as the 
film refracts the dissolution of a 
marriage through the struggling 
couples’ son.

In 1960s, small-town Montana, 

Jerry Brinson (Jake Gyllenhaal, 
“Nightcrawler”) loses his job as 
a golf pro. In his despair, Jerry 
decides to take a job fighting 
the wildfire raging nearby and 
sets his family’s tailspin in 
motion. Fourteen-year-old Joe 
(Ed Oxenbould, “The Visit”) 
consequently becomes the sole 
witness to his mother Jeanette’s 
(Carey Mulligan, “An Education”) 
rage in response to his father’s 
rash decision, as well as her 
primary confidant. Though the 
ensuing story hinges on his 
parents’ reactions to misfortune, 
in the spirit of the novel that 
inspired the film, it nonetheless 
foregrounds 
Joe’s 
experience. 

In doing so, it dares to tell the 
familiar tale of marital discord in 
an unfamiliar, important way. At 
the same time, however, Dano’s 
consistently contemplative tone 
makes for a complicated viewing 
experience.

Cinematographer 
Diego 

García’s (“Neon Bull”) inventive 
camerawork 
does 
much 
of 

the work of emphasizing the 
underrepresented 
perspective 

Joe embodies. Take, for instance, 
how 
conversations 
are 
shot. 

During pivotal dialogues — his 
father’s boss firing him, his 
parents arguing over his father’s 
decision to go fight the wildfire — 
the camera redirects and zooms 
in on Joe’s face, prioritizing Joe’s 
witnessing of conversations over 
other characters’ participation in 
them, reminding audiences how 
children are inevitably mired 
in their parents’ actions and 
reactions.

While the filmmakers endeavor 

to respect Joe’s perspective, Jerry 
and Jeannette are often too selfish 
to realize they cross the line in 

terms of what they say to and do 
in front of Joe. In that sense, they 
use him like a sounding board 
and treat him like a sponge. In 
one 
unsettling 
sequence, 
his 

mother brings him to the house 
of the man (Ed Camp, “Loving”) 
with whom she’s committing 
adultery. His father later forces 
him to retell and thus relive 
this traumatic experience. As 
countless other examples of his 
parents’ overstepping accumulate, 
you wonder: How much more can 
the boy possibly take? 

Over time, however, viewers 

might ask the same of the 
filmmakers. 
Oxenbould 
does 

the best he can with his how-
could-you-do-that-in-front-of-me 
face, but the film does not give 
him the chance to show much 

range. 
Relatedly, 
Oxenbould’s 

Joe lacks perhaps not depth, but 
breadth. Though his parents 
use him like a sponge, had the 
filmmakers allowed him to leak 
every once in a while, to break 
from his constant facial register, 
to snap, perhaps he would have 
seemed a little more lifelike and 
a little less superhuman with 
some bottomless capacity for his 
parents’ problems.

Dano’s 
consistently 

contemplative 
tone 
likewise 

compromises the statements he 
seeks to make in “Wildlife.” There 
is such a thing as contemplative 
to the point of losing touch with 
your audience, and “Wildlife” 
always hovers on the verge of such 
a breakdown. For example, even 
the aforementioned technique 
used to capture conversations 
begins to feel overused with 
time. Can inventive camerawork 
compensate for cryptic dialogue? 
Can it tell us all we need to know 
about a character? Can it prop 
up visual motifs — e.g. wildfires, 
portraiture and frames within 
frames — that one cannot help but 
suspect might be symptomatic of 
the book-to-film adaptation?

“Wildlife” does not concern 

itself with providing audience 
members any relief or gratification. 
The brutal honesty of the film 
is demanding, and its refusal of 
gratification requires much post-
viewing reflection and turmoil 
to arrive at any resolutions, no 
matter 
how 
provocative 
and 

necessary the questions regarding 
selfishness 
and 
parent-child 

dynamics within a marriage may 
be. While “Wildlife” may ask a 
lot of the viewer, the question 
each viewer has to ask in turn is 
whether “Wildlife” gave enough.

FILM REVIEW

“Wildlife”

Michigan Theater

June Pictures

On the corner of Fletcher and 

South Thayer St. lies 202 South 
Thayer — a quaint building often 
overshadowed by the Modern 
Language Building and North 
Quad, with whom it shares the 
intersection. Inside is the Institute 
for the Humanities (among other 
offices) and the art gallery situated 
immediately to the left when one 
enters through the doors.

This 
semester 
alone, 
the 

Institute for the Humanities has 
backed two powerful exhibitions 
tackling 
contemporary 
social 

and political issues. In Sept. and 
Oct., the gallery hosted Esmaa 
Mohamoud’s “The Draft” — a 
series of staged photographs that 
comment on Black representation 
in public spaces. The Institute 
was also the driving force behind 
“Luzinterruptus: Literature and 

Traffic,” the one night instillation 
of 10,000 books on Liberty Street. 
Now, the Institute is hosting 
Gideon Mendel’s “Deluge,” a video 
installation contained within his 
“Drowning World” project — a 
photograph and video based work 
that confronts the consequences of 
climate change through floods.

Mendel got his start as a 

photographer 
in 
his 
home 

country of South Africa in the 
1980s. Mendel was known as a 
“struggle photographer,” a term 
for a small group of South African 
photographers documenting the 
drastic changes and hardships the 
country was undergoing during 
the final years of apartheid. This 
dedication to chronicling adversity 
and sociopolitical issues can be 
seen throughout the rest of his 
career. Mendel has produced photo 
series on the HIV crisis, disabled 
children in Africa and the “Jungle” 
refugee camp in Calais, France. For 
the past 10 years, Mendel’s primary 
focus has been on his “Drowning 

World” project.

“Deluge” is a tactfully edited 

five-screen 
installation. 
When 

one sits in front of the screens and 
watches the 12 minute artwork 
from front to back, the extreme 
attention to detail is immediately 
recognizable.

“(‘Deluge’) puts together all 

the narrative concepts of the 
Drowning World Project,” Mendel 
said in an interview with The Daily. 
Indeed, within “Deluge” there are 
aspects of all three photo series in 
“Drowning World”: “Submerged 
Portraits,” 
“Floodlines” 
and 

“Watermarks.”

The video begins with all five 

screens displaying a “Floodline” 
against 
various 
buildings 
at 

equal height. We then are moved 
through the flooded cities and 
landscapes. People slowly start to 
appear in the frames, and we begin 
to comprehend the toll the water 
has taken on the communities. On 
each screen, several beautifully 
composed “Submerged Portraits” 

JOSEPH FRALEY

Daily Blog Editor

Gideon Mendel’s ‘Deluge’: 
Finding beauty in the flood

are shown one after another. A 
full day pases before we start to 
migrate into people’s homes with 
them.

In 
this 
moment, 
Mandel 

positions his camera in such a way 
that the viewer feels that they are 
physically entering the house with 
the homeowner for the first time 
since the flood. The work ends 
with a collage of “Watermark” 
pictures with the sound of water 
rushing in the background. Mandel 
describes “Deluge” as “a journey,” 
and I certainly agree. The journey 
grants a holistic view of the flood’s 
impact.

Adjacent to the gallery space is a 

multipurpose room, which Gideon 
described as: “is in conversation 
with the other room,” where some 
of his work is also on display. It 
is a space he has “been given the 
opportunity to do whatever he 
wants with.”

With this freedom, he has 

chosen to include images from the 
three photo series of the project, 
as well as display a looping video 
titled: “67 film clips of South 
Carolina.” The South Carolina 
footage serves as a window into 
Gideon’s process. We can hear 
him giving instruction to subjects, 
commenting on the nature of his 
shots and moving through the 

spaces.

The first thing I noticed about 

the 
“Submerged 
Portraits” 

displayed in the multipurpose 
room was the monotony of each 
subject’s gaze into the camera. 
Gideon describes it as, “a moment 
of connection” with the subject. 
It would be easy for each person’s 
face to illustrate pain or hope, but 
the poker-faced expression of every 
flood victim causes a conversation 
to take place between them and 
the viewer. What are they feeling? 
Where do they go from here?

All of these people throughout 

the world are experiencing the 
ramifications of global warming 
in tandem. They live thousands of 
miles apart and their suffering is 
separated by years, but they are all 
linked through the water’s seizure 
of their homes.

“(Gideon’s work) forces us to 

ask ourselves difficult questions,” 
gallery curator Amanda Krugliak 
said in an interview with The 
Daily.

A primary reason I find Gideon’s 

work alluring is the aesthetic 
quality that damage adds to the 
pictures and videos. On the back 
wall of the multipurpose room is 
a group of framed “Watermark” 
pictures. The “Watermarks” are 
old family photos that have been 

damaged by the flooding water. 
Although what originally took up 
the frame is mostly destroyed, the 
water has added color and texture 
to the photographs that otherwise 
would be absent. The distortion 
of the pictures lure the viewer in 
and begs the questions: What is 
our position as an audience if we’re 
enjoying Gideon capturing the 
plight of these people, and does the 
audience become morally corrupt?

Perhaps what Gideon provides 

is, as Krugliak put it, “a face” for 
the drowning world. Flooding in 
Europe and the United States alone 
has rapidly increased over the past 
10 years due to climate change, and 
the curve is exponential. By 2040, 
it’s estimated that the total flood 
days in one year for 30 U.S. coastal 
cities will multiply by 18-fold.

It’s easy for us to dismiss 

flooding as a result of climate 
change, especially when, here 
in Michigan, we aren’t directly 
subjected to its effects. Part of the 
reason Krugliak chose to exhibit 
Gideon’s work was to “show us 
something that would connect us 
to what’s going on beyond here.” 
The aesthetic quality of Gideon’s 
work forces us to pay attention, to 
wash away our apathy and imagine 
if our own spaces underwent a 
wave of destruction.

SARAH KUNKEL / DAILY

Here’s a take from a former 

Daily Arts writer: Why do we tend 
to gravitate towards an artist’s 
pre-fame albums rather than the 
ones made once they’re signed 
to a big label? Shafii originally 
used Chief Keef’s Finally Rich and 
Playboi Carti’s Die Lit as examples, 
but Anderson .Paak’s Oxnard, 
also falls into this category and 
simultaneously 
complicates 
it. 

Months before the album came 
out, when “Bubblin’” was released 
as a single, it was obvious .Paak 
was headed in the direction of “I’m 
rich now.” Everything about the 
single plays into extravagance and 
ostentation: “I been, broker way 
longer than I been rich so until it 
levels out / I’ma take your mama to 
the Marriott and wear it out.” He’s 
wearing a fur coat in the music 
video and straddling an ATM. He 
models himself after Salvador Dali 
while spraying cash. But the thing 
about .Paak’s excessiveness is that 
it’s fun. You can’t be upset about 
his cheekiness when the music 
and the rapping reaches towards 
perfection.

Despite three singles which 

continually raised the stakes for 
this album (“Bubblin,” “Tints” 
and “Who R U?”) Oxnard doesn’t 
meet the standards .Paak has set 
for himself. Malibu — his second 
album, which he independently 
released in 2016 before being 
signed to Dr. Dre’s label — was a 
masterpiece, and because of its 
commercial success, the world 
was finally introduced to .Paak’s 
signature rasp and R&B. This 
was his come up, and combined 
with his debut Venice, .Paak 
drew attention from Dre as well 
as countless other artists whose 
songs he’d soon have features on. 
But Oxnard, no longer his come up 
but his claim to fame, he tries to 
do too much, making the 14-track 
album drag on rather than breeze 
through.

There are high points to 

Oxnard: The opening track, “The 
Chase,” is a breathlessly beautiful 

combination of neo-jazz and soul 
that has .Paak stumbling over his 
words as a chorus of drums and 
flutes unfolds in the background. 
We are eased into “Headlow,” 
“Tints” 
and 
“Who 
R 
U?” 

seamlessly, and the direction .Paak 
is taking with the album is clear. 
There seems to be a break down 
of his traditional R&B sound. 
His flow is slower, he’s taking 
his time on these tracks, but the 
payoff is still sultry and smooth. “6 
Summers,” one of the high points 
of the album, takes on the role of 
the album’s most overtly political 
track: “Trump’s got a love child, 

and I hope that bitch is buckwild.” 
Even at his most serious, Cheeky 
Andy remains cheeky, and these 
are the lyrics that will be following 
the presidency around for the next 
six summers or until Trump is out 
of office.

It’s after these first few tracks 

that the album starts to dip off. 
“Saviers Road” and “Smile/Petty,” 
while incorporating more funk-
styled influence than we’ve heard 
from .Paak in the past, seem to 
hold .Paak back from what he’s 
good at. He never hits his stride 
with them, and the same can be 
said for “Mansa Musa.” Between 
the Dr. Dre and Cocoa Sarai 
features, the song comes across as 
more of a “King Kunta” pastiche. 
There are points when it feels like 
.Paak is going to hit the flow that 
both made Malibu a triumph and, 
more recently, made “Bubblin’” 
a summer essential, but he never 
quite gets there.

It 
must 
be 
said 
that 
in 

comparison 
to 
the 
flawless 

features .Paak always delivers to 
other artist’s music, they don’t 
do the same for him. For such a 
feature-heavy album, there are 
only a few who seem to match 

.Paak’s rhythm and vocals. Kadhja 
Bonet, Pusha T and Snoop Dogg 
deliver, while J. Cole, Q-Tip and BJ 
The Chicago Kid fall and falter. On 
“Brother’s Keeper” Pusha T brings 
Daytona to Oxnard. The guitar and 
drums fall heavy, leading to an 
immersive and sprawling track 
that sets it apart from the light-
hearted songs to come before it. 
But from the heaviness comes 
a breath of fresh air: “Brother’s 
Keeper” which ends in .Paak’s 
desperate voice calling, “How I 
ever, ever let you go?” takes a left 
turn and sends us straight into 
Snoop Dogg’s “blunts.” Hand him 
his mink, .Paak.

Is this a going to be a bad take? 

Maybe, but I genuinely think 
that the Snoop Dogg feature on 
Oxnard is the best of them all. 
In the Pitchfork review, Torii 
MacAdams calls Snoop Dogg the 
Willie Nelson of rap music these 
days. And, despite this being an 
extremely Pitchfork claim to make 
in a hip-hop review, it holds some 
truth. Snoop comes through on 
“Anywhere” 
and 
immediately 

lightens the mood, and beside 
Kendrick Lamar on “Tints,” he 
seems to be the only collaborator 
on the album who can match 
.Paak’s smooth lyricism. It’s the 
California 
double-feature 
the 

second half of this album needed 
to stay afloat.

Where .Paak succeeds on this 

album, his collaborators appear 
to fail and vice versa. “Trippy” is 
a funk-infused, sprawling song 
that has potential until J.Cole 
comes in with no regard for the 
tone of the song and marrs it. The 
Q-Tip feature places him second 
to Snoop and sounds, if anything, 
uncomfortable. But even when 
.Paak isn’t doing his best, he’s 
still doing better than most. We 
saw him on his rise, praised this 
new R&B sound a Cali-raised 
boy gifted us with on Venice and 
Malibu and expected even more 
from an album born and bred in 
.Paak’s nouveau riche lifestyle. In 
trying to do too much though, in 
trying to bring this “I’m rich now” 
extravagance to Oxnard, .Paak 
falls short.

FILM REVIEW

Running down the “Widows” 

cast list is like running down 
a who’s who of in demand 
Hollywood 
talent. 
There’s 

dramatic powerhouses like Viola 
Davis (“Fences”) and Carrie Coon 
(“The Post”), action genre favorites 
like Michelle Rodriguez (“The 
Fate of the Furious”) and Liam 
Neeson (“The Commuter”), major 
TV players like Brian Tyree Henry 
(“Atlanta”) and Jon Bernthal 
(“Marvel’s The Punisher”) and 
spotlight newcomers like Daniel 
Kaluuya (“Black Panther”) and 
Cynthia Erivo (“Bad Times at the 
El Royale”). It’s an insane group 
of insanely talented performers 
director Steve McQueen (“12 
Years a Slave”) has assembled, 
one that could easily could have 
gone undeserved, as any number 
of stacked casts do every year. The 
foundation of “Widows” isn’t in 
its cast, though; it’s in the script 
written by McQueen and Gillian 
Flynn (“Sharp Objects”).

For a story that, at times, is 

almost intimately focused on the 
internal lives of its leads and even 
its side characters, thematically 
“Widows” is an epic work that 
examines inequity in all its forms, 
from racism to class to the pitfalls 
of capitalism. The world is founded 
on viciously abusive cycles, it 

argues. Everyone is indebted 
to someone higher up the food 
chain. In what is destined to be the 
movie’s most memorable moment, 
McQueen mounts a camera on 
the hood of a car to make his 
film’s heart manifest and shoots 
a tracking shot that takes viewers 

from a poor, predominantly Black 
neighborhood 
to 
ritzy, 
white 

mansions in the space of just a 
few blocks. It’s a breathtaking 
bit of filmmaking not just for its 
technical merits, but for what it 
says without saying anything at 
all.

This is also a crime film, 

however, one sold on car chases 
and 
gunplay, 
and 
from 
the 

immediately 
visceral 
opening 

scene, “Widows” establishes itself 
as a thrill ride just as concerned 
with the character beats in 
between the heists as it is with the 
heists themselves. We’re treated 
to quiet, idyllic shots of Davis and 
Neeson in bed together, juxtaposed 
without warning with scenes of 
frightening 
violence, 
cracking 

gunshots and screaming. The rest 
of the movie proceeds in much the 
same way; even at its most internal 
moments, the specter of a bloody 
death – personified with terrifying 
psychotic energy by Kaluuya – is 
never far removed from the minds 
of the characters. It takes its time 
establishing its story and its huge 
cast of characters, which only 
makes the breathless second half 
that much more enthralling.

It’s on this foundation of 

smart writing and direction that 
McQueen’s cast soars. It would 
be easy to imagine Davis, one of 
the most wildly talented actresses 
alive, stealing the show, and while 
she’s as commanding a presence 
as ever, the spotlight just as often 
belongs to Elizabeth Debicki 
(“The Cloverfield Paradox”) as 
Alice, a woman struggling to claim 
her own agency after the death of 
her abusive husband forces her to 
find work as an escort. For how 
brutal and cold “Widows” can be, 
in Alice’s arc there is an ounce of 
catharsis without which the film 
may have proven too bleak.

And make no mistake, for all the 

popcorn thrills that are promised 
and eventually delivered upon, 
“Widows” is a hard movie, one 
that forces its viewers to look at 
society and reckon with its flaws 
and injustice. You’ll gasp at its 
twists and turns just as you’ll sit 
back and think long and hard 
about what you’ve just seen.

Had Desiree Akhavan not 

explicitly said that she dislikes 
being 
called 
the 
bisexual 

Lena Dunham, I might have 
compared her excellent new 
show on Hulu, “The Bisexual,” 
to HBO’s “Girls.” It’s a difficult 
comparison to resist — there’s 
something 
awfully 
familiar 

about 
the 
pithy, 
neurotic 

dialogue, fumbly sex scenes 
and skittish, scruffy characters 
who straddle the line between 
being in on the joke and being 
the punchline.

But 
“The 
Bisexual” 

manages to do what so many 
introspective 
mumblecore-

type shows — “Girls” included 
— often struggle to pull off: It 
finds something to say. Despite 
having all the trappings of a 
show about nothing, it’s very 
much a show about something; 
it’s a new sort of coming-out 
story that muses thoughtfully 
on 
intergenerational 
and 

cultural tensions.

Leila (Akhavan, “Appropriate 

Behavior”) 
is 
an 
Iranian-

American woman living in 
London with her longterm 
girlfriend 
and 
business 

partner, Sadie (Maxine Peake, 
“Silk”). 
Together, 
they’re 

working on an app they market 
as “Shazam for clothing.” But 
just before the app’s launch, 
Sadie 
proposes, 
and 
Leila 

gets cold feet about the whole 
relationship. They decide to 
take a break, and Leila is left to 
reflect on her own history and 
identity.

We know from the show’s 

beginning that Leila is the 
titular bisexual — following 
her breakup with Sadie, she 
begins to explore her attraction 
to men. But it’s Leila herself 
who is most afraid to adopt 
the label. “It’s tacky,” she says, 
balking at the term when a 
new roommate uses it. “It’s 
gauche, it makes you seem 
disingenuous, like your genitals 
have no allegiance. Like you 
have no criteria for people, just 
an open door policy.”

Her reluctance stems from 

a few places: her judgmental 
social 
circles, 
her 
own 

insecurities and, most of all, 
the fact that she has only 
identified as a lesbian her 
entire life. “Everyone under 
25 thinks they’re queer,” Leila 
explains to a college student 
who can’t understand why 
identifying as bisexual is such 
a big deal. “When you have to 
fight for it, I think that being 
gay can become the biggest 
part of you. You’re gay or you’re 
straight and one comes with an 
entirely different lifestyle than 
the other, like different clothes 
and different friends, and you 
can’t do both.”

And indeed, to Sadie, who 

is several years older than 
Leila, 
Leila’s 
bisexuality 

comes as a kind of betrayal, 
a flippant position to take on 
something loaded with trauma 
and struggle. “Have you any 
idea what it takes to be a dyke 

growing up in the ’80s?” Sadie 
yells.

Though “The Bisexual” is 

steeped in raw, uncomfortable 
vulnerability, 
it 
is 
also 

intensely, 
mordantly 
funny. 

We’re 
given 
some 
comic 

relief in Gabe (Brian Gleeson, 
“Love/Hate”), Leila’s painfully 
straight roommate who goes 
to dinner with Leila’s lesbian 
friends and immediately asks 
them what they thought of 
“Blue is the Warmest Color.” 
The 
show’s 
best 
zingers, 

though, are reserved for Leila’s 
friend Deniz (newcomer Saskia 
Chana), who compares Leila to 
a girl in a Judd Apatow movie 
when she begins socializing 
with straight people. “I didn’t 
realize you were so familiar 
with his oeuvre,” Leila snipes 
back. In another episode, an 
employee accuses Leila and 
Sadie of filling the office 
bathroom’s 
Aesop 
bottles 

with Imperial Leather. It’s 
the sort of reference you’ll 
only 
understand 
if 
you’re 

well-versed in the world of 
expensive hand soaps, but the 
joke’s unapologetic nicheness 
almost makes it funnier.

It’s the humor that lends 

“The Bisexual” its emotional 
authenticity, with motivations 
that feel real and lived-in. 
Despite being the sort of people 
who could easily be unlikable 
— the type that goes to bizarre 
performance art shows and 
buys plantains at the farmers 
market — everyone on “The 
Bisexual” is endearing and 
appealing. Careful plotting and 
Akhavan’s own tender writing 
let each character have their 
own awakening, big and small.

TV REVIEW

“The Bisexual”

Hulu

Thanksgiving is a time for 

family. A holiday with no religious 
affiliation, a day filled with food 
and pie and football. The day 
begins with cooking and ends with 
cleaning. Somewhere in there 
the Lions will probably lose and 
someone will proclaim that Jim 
Harbuagh “really hasn’t been given 
enough credit.” Tears will be shed, 
a toddler will hit their head on a 
foosball table and the family will 
take their collective ability to talk 
at the speed of light and use it to 
verbally berate some politician or 
ghost of the family’s past. Once the 
tryptophan starts wearing off and 
everyone has woken up from their 
mid afternoon naps, only one thing 
remains: choosing a movie to watch 
that night.

Choosing a movie to watch with 

any group larger than two can be 
difficult. Studies have shown that 
the more options human beings 
are given the more difficult it is for 
them to make a decision. When 
faced with only two options it is 
much easier for our brains to weigh 
the pros and cons of each and by 
directly comparing the two come to 
a decision. This is why sometimes 
you find yourself having analysis 
paralysis when staring at your 
Netflix, unable to make any kind 
of decision. It’s hard enough for a 
single person to decide on a movie 
to watch when the entire history 
of cinema is available to them at 
the touch of a button, but throw in 
10 more people of varying ages and 
dispositions and you’ve just created 
the perfect recipe for endless 
arguing.

My grandparents have a taste 

that consists almost exclusively 
of really bad romantic comedies 
from 2004. My uncle always 
wants to watch “Ferris Bueller’s 
Day Off.” Some people like action 
movies and some hate them. My 
mom won’t watch anything that 
doesn’t pass “the Mom scare test.” 
Harry Potter barely passes. I have 
a cousin who went through a long 
period of time where he would only 
watch Disney’s “Miracle.” Trying 

to find a movie that is suitable for 
everyone is a Sisyphean task not 
worth the trouble. Soon someone 
will tell me, “You’re the movie guy, 
Ian, find something everyone will 
like.” Right. Because that’s what 
they’re teaching me in my film 
classes, where to find the list of 

movies that are suitable for both 
70-year-old women and teenage 
boys. 

They used to make movies that 

fit this description. We’ve watched 
them all. “Back to the Future.” “The 
Karate Kid.” “Ferris Bueller.” There 
is a whole genre of what I like to 
call “true family comedies” that 
no longer exists. Films that have a 
real story and real characters that 
are funny and intelligent and can 
be enjoyed by all ages. There aren’t 
really movies like this anymore. 
Nowadays there are three kinds of 
comedies made and none of them 
check all the boxes. There are super 
raunchy R-rated films like “The 
Hangover” 
and 
“Bridesmaids,” 

there are movies like “RV” that are 
unwatchable if you’re over the age 
of nine and there is whatever Adam 
Sandler crapped out most recently. 
None of these appeal to everyone in 
my family.

The sheer number of options 

available today makes finding a 
movie an endless quest that will 
make you wish you had never 
suggested it. My grandfather has a 
penchant for scrolling mindlessly 
through the new releases on 
Comcast OnDemand. With no real 
knowledge of what any of these 
movies are about, you’ll often find 

him proclaim some R-rated raunch 
fest to “look kind of interesting” or to 
go “What is Ant Man? Is that a real 
movie?” Don’t even get me started 
on my dad’s strange obsession with 
Robert Downey Jr. despite having 
not watched anything starring the 
man in almost a decade. “I heard 
the new Robert Downey is good, 
maybe everyone will like that” 
he’ll proclaim before my brother 
reminds him that he wouldn’t 
understand 
“Avengers: 
Infinity 

War” if we gave him a Marvel 
encyclopedia to keep next to him 
the entire time. Inevitably someone 
will remember that “Cheaper by 
the Dozen 2” exists and will try to 
convince the rest of the family that 
we haven’t seen it a dozen times 
before.

In the end, a “Seinfeld” DVD 

will hit the back of the player and 
everyone will be more or less 
content. After an episode and a 
half the grandparents are basically 
asleep, my parents aren’t far behind 
them and the Wii is calling and it’s 
saying let’s play “Madden 2008.” If 
anyone reaches the third episode on 
the disk they’ve made it farther than 
any of us could have anticipated. 
Slowly the beds are filled. A last piece 
of pie is snuck out of the kitchen. An 
aunt laughs over a game of Scrabble 
as my grandfather tries to play 
the word “Hrot” claiming that it 
is an “obscure plant that can only 
be found in Thailand.” Discarded 
movies that had no chance of being 
chosen litter the ground. Tomorrow 
will see the usual criticism of Black 
Friday, 
bewilderment 
at 
how 

quickly the apple crumb pie was 
eaten and discussion of a possible 
trip to the movies. That might lead 
to an argument too. Most of the 
movies in the theaters are bad after 
all. Why not just stay in and watch 
something at home? What should 
we watch? No one knows. It all 
begins again. We don’t really care 
though, because it’s never really 
been about the movie. It’s just about 
being together. Year in and year out, 
that’s still something to be thankful 
for.

Patterson is familiar with, and ready for, Ohio State

When 
Shea 
Patterson 
announced 
his 
transfer 
to 
Michigan last December, he 
did it in the way any college 
student makes announcements: 
on Twitter.
As one would expect, the 
reactions 
were 
varied 
and 
plentiful, and one of them came 
from a surprising source.
Ohio 
State 
quarterback 
Dwayne Haskins quote-tweeted 
Patterson’s 
announcement, 
saying: “Rivalry just got a lot 
more interesting bro.”
From the outside, it was an 
innocuous comment from the 
Wolverines’ rival quarterback, 
simply commenting on the state 
of the rivalry.
But Patterson and Haskins 
know each other well. They were 
the No. 1 and No. 8 quarterback 
recruits, 
respectively, 
in 
the 2016 recruiting class, so 
they went to plenty of camps 
together. 
Tuesday, 
Patterson 
spoke to media and estimated 
that he and Haskins have known 
each other since seventh or 
eighth grade.
“I would (call us friends),” 
Patterson 
said. 
“We’re 
not 
gonna be friends on Saturday, 
but just like anything else, it’s 
football. Off the field. Before the 
game, probably not. Later down 
the road, yeah.
“But nobody not wearing the 
maize and blue is my friend on 
Saturday.”
His relationship with the 
opposing 
quarterback 
is 
a 
reminder that Patterson is more 
familiar than a normal transfer 
would be with the history 
surrounding the program he 
joined.
Patterson grew up in Toledo, 
Oh. as a Michigan fan — his 
father 
was 
a 
season-ticket 
holder — and he says his favorite 
memories of The Game growing 
up were of watching highlights 
of Charles Woodson playing the 
Buckeyes.
It makes sense Patterson 

would look back to those games, 
since Michigan is 2-15 in its last 
17 matchups with Ohio State. 
The last real good Wolverine 
memories from The Game are 
the Woodson days from 1995-
1997.
Patterson is familiar with that 
history too, and he knows what 
Saturday’s edition of The Game 
means to fans and players alike. 
However, he also recognizes 
there is more than just bragging 
rights at stake this season.
“Obviously, everybody knows 
how big of a game it is and how 
much of a rivalry this is to us 
and them,” Patterson said. “But 
there’s just a lot more at stake. 
There’s a Big Ten title and a 
national playoff spot, so not too 
sure how often both of us have 
that opportunity. So there’s a 
lot more at stake than just the 
rivalry.”
In that, Patterson is correct.
Michigan 
has 
a 
chance 
to send itself to the Big Ten 

Championship 
and 
keep 
its 
national 
championship 
aspirations alive for at least 
another week.
And, Patterson is to thank for 
that.
Quarterback play has severely 
handicapped 
the 
Wolverines 
in past iterations of The Game. 
Last season, especially, comes 
to mind, when a consistent 
quarterback may have been 
enough to push Michigan over 
the top in a close matchup.
Patterson has thrown for 2,177 
yards, 18 touchdowns and just 
four interceptions this season. 
He has the 17th-best passing 
efficiency and the 19th-best 
completion percentage in the 
country.
His ability to run the ball 
has changed the dynamic of 
the Wolverines’ offense, and 
what they are capable of doing 
completely.
“Shea has been an integral 
part of this team,” said fifth-

year senior linebacker Noah 
Furbush. “Really just being an 
anchor on offense for us. He’s 
kind of that guy that makes 
plays for us. He is what you want 
a quarterback to be — somebody 
who controls the game, makes 
plays for you when you need it 
and really is a leader for your 
offense and for the team as a 
whole.”
Patterson’s 
impact 
is 
undeniable, and he can make an 
impact on Michigan’s history 
Saturday — if he can do what no 
Wolverine quarterback, or team, 
has been able to do since 2000 — 
beat Ohio State in Columbus.
If there was any Michigan 
team who had a good chance 
of doing that, it’s this season’s 
team, and that is, in part, 
because of Patterson.
In 
that 
sense, 
it 
seems 
Haskins may have been right 
back in December. Patterson 
has made this rivalry game a lot 
more interesting.

Michigan ousts Lehigh, 
21-13 in first home meet

Wrestlers swipe at each other’s 
ankles, referees circle the mat and 
AC/DC’s Thunderstruck blasts 
from Crisler Center’s speakers.
Michigan wrestling is back in 
Ann Arbor.
In the first home dual meet of 
the season, themed ‘Wrestle ‘n 
Roll,’ the fifth-ranked Michigan 
wrestling team (2-0) beat sixth-
ranked Lehigh (0-1), 21-13, with 
key wins from sophomore Drew 
Mattin, redshirt junior Myles 
Amine and redshirt freshman 
Jelani Embree.
The Wolverines started the 
meet 
strong 
with 
dominant 
wins in the 133 and 141-pound 
weight classes, delivered with 
gritty takedowns by redshirt 
junior Stevan Micic and redshirt 
sophomore 
Kanen 
Storr, 
respectively. The wins swung 
Michigan’s score to 6-0 early in 
the meet.
Despite 
initial 
momentum, 
redshirt senior Malik Amine 
faced a tough opponent in the 
149-pound division and came 
away from the second period tied 
2-2. Amine left the match with 
an injury soon after and went 
through 
concussion 
protocol, 
dropping the match by default 
and evening the team score to 
6-6.
Frustrated by the default loss 
in a close match, the Wolverines 
came back with a 9-7 win by 
redshirt junior Ben Lamantia and 
a 5-3 win by redshirt junior Logan 
Massa. Michigan began taking 
control of the meet, after Myles 
Amine’s 5-4 win over Lehigh’s 
Jordan Kutler in the 174-pound 
division. Amine and Kutler, both 
All-Americans and ranked in the 
top-10 nationally for their weight 
class, wrestled each other twice 
last year — each earning a win.
Amine delivered a takedown to 
start the match, which Lehigh’s 
coach challenged. Despite the 

objections, the referees upheld 
the call and Kutler responded 
with a takedown, tying the score 
at 2-2. Quick footwork at the 
start of the second period led to 
a Michigan escape, and a final 
takedown in the last 30 seconds 
captured the win for Amine and 
pushed the overall score to 15-6.
“I knew that if I went out there 
and stayed offensive that I’d come 
away with a win,” Amine said. “I 
wrestled a very similar match to 
how I did at the NCAA’s against 
him, so it feels good.”
Embree continued Michigan’s 
success, ousting his opponent 7-3 
after early takedowns.
Though the Wolverines lost 
their next two matches in the 
197-pound 
and 
heavyweight 
divisions, Mattin rounded out 
the meet with a dramatic pin 
and scrappy 3-2 win. Mattin’s 
win brought the team score to 
21-13 and secured the win for 
Michigan — a hard fought result 
considering the letdown after the 
meet was postponed from Friday.
“We won against Central 
(Michigan) and then we had a lot 
of buildup, and I feel like our guys 
were really keyed up to wrestle 
Friday night,” said Michigan 
coach Sean Bormet. “Continuing 
to wrestle hard and work over 
the full seven minutes will be an 
important piece going into Las 
Vegas.”
Myles Amine seconded the 
disappointment of the change in 
date, but noted the importance 
of 
the 
win 
on 
the 
team’s 
preparations for the Nov. 30 
tournament in Las Vegas.
“You really just have to not 
focus on those things and just 
focus on what’s relevant, which 
is just showing up and wrestling, 
whether that’s on a Friday or a 
Sunday,” Amine said. “Lehigh 
was a team that beat us up pretty 
bad last year, so to turn around 
and gain some momentum going 
into Las Vegas is a good win for 
the team.”

For Gary, frustration for last two years lingers

Tuesday afternoon, Rashan 
Gary faced reporters with a 
measured edge. Asked about 
his brief recruitment with 
Ohio State, Gary provided 
terse answers.
“What else do you want 
me to tell you about that?” he 
chided. 
With the biggest game of his 
college career to date looming, 
Gary had only one thing on his 
mind.
“Everybody 
knows 
what 
week it is,” he said. “I’m 
focused. I’m trying to hurry 
up, get back to watching film. 
It’s one of those types of 
weeks.”
The junior defensive end 
will anchor the top-ranked 
defense in the country heading 
into Saturday’s de facto Big 
Ten East title game. At this 
point, 
everybody 
knows 
what’s on the line: a spot in 
the Big Ten Championship 
game against Northwestern, 
College Football Playoff hopes, 
perhaps the balance of power 
in the conference for the 
foreseeable future.
So, in short, just about 
everything.
It mirrors the game two 
years ago — Gary’s freshman 
year — in which Michigan fell, 
30-27, in double overtime. For 
those around at the time, Gary 
among them, that heartbreak 
festers.
“My freshman year, we were 
close to winning. A couple of 
plays went sideways,” he said. 
“It’s just that one big play 
that 
everybody 
remembers. 
I don’t want to talk about it, 
but 
everybody 
knows 
that 
play. That’s what I keep in the 
back of my head, and I know 
my brothers keep that in the 
back of their head and use it 
as motivation going into this 
game.”
“That one big play,” of 
course, 
was 
JT 
Barrett’s 
fourth down conversion. The 
referee awarded Barrett a first 
down, 
despite 
inconclusive 
replays questioning the spot 
of the ball. Gary doesn’t want 

to talk about it, but the trauma 
still lingers. Asked about his 
recollection of those moments, 
the memories unspool.
“Man. 
Bring 
me 
back,” 
he 
said. 
“I 
was 
highly 
disappointed, 
because 
I’m 
looking up at the screen and to 
myself I’m like, ‘Nah, can’t be a 
first down.’ Then they end up 
getting it. It’s 
a little slap on 
the face, but you 
know what it is, 
it is what it is.”
A 
year 
later, 
more 
disappointment. 
Michigan 
led 
14-0 after the 
fourth 
quarter 
and 
appeared 
poised to upset 
the Buckeyes. Led by backup 
quarterback Dwayne Haskins, 
Ohio 
State 
subsequently 
stormed past a tired Michigan 
defense.
For the Wolverines, that’s 
what this rivalry has been for 
the better part of two decades: 
annual frustration. 

“We came out hot to a 
good start (last year), then 
we just started making small 
mistakes,” Gary said. “And 
small mistakes end up putting 
points on the board. They 
started gaining big yardage 
plays. That’s something I take 
apart from last year. This year 
we’re a different team, and I 
feel like we’re 
closer 
as 
a 
team. We know 
what we need to 
do and we know 
what we need to 
take care of.”
Gary 
says 
that this year, it 
feels different. 
This is no lip 
service.
Michigan has 
marched its way through the 
“Revenge Tour” with utter 
dominance, rattling off nine 
consecutive dominant wins 
after the loss to Notre Dame.
For one, it has quarterback 
Shea Patterson running the 
show, who is in the midst of one 
of the best statistical seasons 

by a Michigan quarterback 
in several years. Gary called 
him “a piece of the team we 
needed.” 
The 
Wolverines 
enter Columbus a four-point 
favorite for good reason.
And Gary, for his part, 
appears ready to make his 
mark. He returned from a 
lingering 
shoulder 
injury 
three weeks ago against Penn 
State. 
Last 
week 
against 
Indiana, he notched 1.5 sacks, 
tossing 
around 
offensive 
linemen the way he’s shown in 
flashes during his three years.
He 
won’t 
make 
any 
guarantees or offer any baited 
one-line zingers. But Gary and 
his teammates aren’t hiding 
their confidence. What makes 
this year different?
“Just our brotherhood. I 
feel like how our swagger is 
and what we want as a team 
goal.”
And for Gary specificially, 
there are conversations to 
have, NFL decisions to make 
in the near future. No time for 
that now, though.
He’s got film to watch.

Wolverines cap season 
at NCAA Championships

The wintry white of the Thomas 
Zimmer Championship Course in 
Madison, Wis. was streaked with 
maize and blue on Saturday as the 
men’s and women’s cross country 
teams competed in the NCAA 
Championships.
After its fourth consecutive 
Great Lakes regional title last 
weekend, the No. 6 women’s team 
capped off its 2018 season on the 
national podium with a fourth-
place finish behind Colorado, New 
Mexico and Oregon. The No. 20 
men’s team beat its ranking with a 
19th-place finish — the fourth top-
20 finish in the last five seasons.
Redshirt 
freshman 
Camille 
Davre and fifth-year senior Avery 
Evenson led the women on the 
snow-covered course at 29th and 
38th, respectively. Those under-40 
finishes qualify Davre and Evenson 
for All-American titles.
“It definitely was tough in that 
the course had a few inches of snow 
on it,” said Michigan women’s 
coach Mike McGuire. “But that’s 
something that everyone had to 
navigate.
“We 
were 
well 
prepared 
knowing that a midwestern city 
like 
Madison 
would 
possibly 
present those elements to us, and 
being from Michigan, it isn’t like 
we haven’t been in it before.”
This strength in the elements 
was evident in the Wolverines’ 
recovery from a difficult start to 
the six-kilometer race.
“At the start, it felt a little dicey 
just with the snow and everyone 
getting out pretty quick,” Davre 
said. “We kind of got swarmed 
because we were in the middle 
of the pack, but I think looking 
back I was surprised at how good 
I felt at the halfway point and I 
kept moving up, looking ahead to 
the next pack and trying to catch 
them.”
In the tough terrain of the last 
two kilometers, Michigan settled 
into its fourth place position — 
which held until the end of the race 
— and edged out the Stanford team 
that had been nipping at their heels 

in the final stretch. Ultimately, 
Michigan finished seven runners 
in the top 100.
The men’s team was led by 
All-American 
sophomore 
Jack 
Aho’s 35th-place finish and also 
highlighted by true freshman John 
Travers’ 79th-place finish in just 
the second ten-kilometer race of 
his cross country career. After a 
strong start, Aho maintained his 
place in the pack in the last five 
kilometers.
Aho’s performance marked a 
significant improvement from last 
year’s race.
“I had run here last year and 
finished 122nd, which was alright 
but nothing crazy,” Aho said. “So I 
took that experience and knew this 
year I wanted to get out hard and 
put myself in contention to be All-
American right away.
“You just have to keep your foot 
on the pedal I guess — that’s how I’d 
describe my strategy throughout.”
Despite 
Aho’s 
strong 
performance, the men’s team 
believed that there was some room 
for improvement. Its 19th-place 
finish was the culmination of 
a season that saw both ups and 
downs.
“We didn’t necessarily run our 
best race yesterday,” Aho said. “But 
I really don’t think we can hang 
our heads at finishing 19th in the 
nation.”
“I think it was a good season for 
us to build off of — we graduated 
three really high quality seniors 
from the team last year and so 
we’ve been in a bit of a rebuilding 
mode this year,” said men’s 
coach Kevin Sullivan. “We’ve got 
everybody back next year and 
we’re adding some really good 
parts to the team, so I think the 
future is very bright for us moving 
forward.”
Both teams ultimately felt their 
seasons ended on a positive note, in 
spite of the snowy conditions.
“It really did help that we were 
wearing our maize bows,” Davre 
said. “Just having those colors — 
the maize and blue — against the 
snow to keep pulling me and the 
others forward throughout the 
race was a tremendous help.”

Matthews adapting 
as isolation scorer

Two and a half minutes into 
Michigan’s 
game 
Saturday 
against George Washington, 
Charles Matthews caught the 
ball on the left wing and faced 
up against Colonials guard 
Justin Mazzulla.
The redshirt junior wing 
dribbled into the post and 
turned to back Mazzulla down 
before quickly spinning to his 
right and launching a high-
arcing baseline jumper that 
found nothing but net.
It was a typical isolation 
setup: as Matthews received 
the entry pass from point 
guard Zavier Simpson, the 
Wolverines cleared out for 
their go-to-guy to do his thing. 
It’s these situations — Mazzulla 
on an island with a preseason 
All-Big Ten honoree — where 
individual talent, more than 
anything, can shine through.
The result? Two points for 
Michigan.
But while Matthews, the 
Wolverines’ leading returning 
scorer, came into the year 
as 
their 
presumed 
focal 
point — and showed why on 
that 
aforementioned 
play 
— the reality is a bit more 
complicated.
The 6-foot-6 forward from 
Chicago indeed averaged 13 
points per game last season 
while shooting a respectable 
49 
percent. 
But 
at 
other 
times, 
Matthews 
delivered 
inconsistent 
performances 
seemingly at odds with his 
considerable 
talent 
and 
athleticism.
Matthews’ 
inconsistency 
with his jump shot and from 
the foul line — he hit just 32 
percent 
of 
his 
3-point 
attempts and 56 
percent of his 
free throws — 
came 
coupled 
with 
decision-
making 
struggles, as he 
led Michigan in 
turnovers 
last 
season. 
These 
deficiencies 
combined to create a lackluster 
101.6 
offensive 
rating, 
the 
lowest among the Wolverines’ 
regular rotation.
The start of the season saw 
more of the same. Against 
Norfolk State and Holy Cross, 
Matthews hit just 12 of 29 field 
goals, including a meager 20 
percent figure from behind the 
arc, while turning the ball over 
five times.
It’s worth noting, however, 
that 
Matthews’ 
struggles 
coincided 
with 
an 
overall 
sluggish start for Michigan on 
offense, in which it averaged 
just 59.5 points per game on 
just 36.4 percent shooting. 
Meanwhile, Michigan coach 
John Beilein never lost faith in 
Matthews’ ability to get going.
“He was just 5-for-6 (on 
free throws during Monday’s 
practice),” Beilein said after 
the win over Norfolk State. 
“But he’s got to get through it, 
and it’s not a physical thing, 
it’s a mental thing. … Charles is 
better than that, and he will be 
as we go forward.”
Last 
Wednesday 
at 

Villanova, Beilein’s faith was 
rewarded.
Matthews 
paced 
the 
Wolverines 
with 
an 
unstoppable series of athletic 
finishes 
at 
the 
rim 
and 
midrange jumpers over smaller 
defenders, finishing with 19 
points on 7-for-13 shooting. 
Against George Washington, 
he was even better, dropping in 
25 points while hitting 10 of his 
13 attempts from the field, and 
both from behind the arc.
Matthews’ 
offensive 
excellence 
didn’t 
continue 
against Providence on Sunday 
as he scored just five points. 
However, his performance over 
the last week was only partly 
about him finding his scoring 
touch — against the Wildcats, 
Colonials and Friars, Matthews 
had clearly found a role.
Instead of having to rely 
solely on Matthews as a source 
of 
playmaking, 
Michigan’s 
offense was expertly piloted 
by Simpson, who dished out 22 
assists in those three contests. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
Wolverines 
began to catch fire from outside, 
shooting 
44 
percent 
from 
3-point range for the weekend. 
These two developments, when 
taken in tandem, helped to take 
pressure off of Matthews in his 
areas of weakness, and allowed 
his strengths to rise to the 
forefront.
In isolation play, Matthews 
was just about unguardable 
with his high release on his 
jumper. He cleaned up on the 
boards — half his rebounds last 
week were on the offensive end 
— thanks to his athleticism. 
Perhaps most strikingly, he 
didn’t turn the ball over once 
last week.
“I play one-on-one a lot, and 
I feel like we all 
do,” Matthews 
said 
Saturday. 
“… 
Playing 
one-on-one, 
it 
makes us better 
defenders, 
but 
it also makes us 
better isolation 
players. There’s 
going 
to 
be 
times 
where 
you have to just 
make a shot.”
Over 
the 
last 
week, 
Michigan’s 
offense 
has 
begun to fire on all cylinders. 
Simpson’s 
emerged 
as 
the 
facilitator. 
Forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis is the downhill, 
ever-aggressive slasher. Center 
Jon Teske is the screen-and-
roll weapon and pick-and-pop 
‘5.’ Forward Isaiah Livers is the 
versatile, small-ball weapon to 
run teams off the floor. Guard 
Jordan Poole, after a sluggish 
start to the year, appears to 
have discovered his shooting 
stroke.
That leaves Matthews as the 
Wolverines’ isolation weapon 
in the midrange; the player 
they can turn to to get a shot 
off against any defense. It’s 
a role — judging by the last 
three games, at least — that fits 
him perfectly. It’s a role that 
lets him do what he does best, 
instead of having to do too 
much.
And it’s a role that may just 
allow him to become the go-to-
guy he’s long been projected to 
be.

‘M’ to face first real test in No. 21 Missouri

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
(3-0) 
might 
have rolled through its season so 
far, but the Wolverines are still 
heating up.
So far, they’ve faced Mount 
St. Mary’s, Western Michigan 
and Detroit Mercy. None of those 
teams have posed any real threat 
whatsoever to Michigan, who has 
outscored opponents 262-144.
After Thanksgiving, though, 
the Wolverines will head to 
Estero, Fla. for their first test 
of the season at the Gulf Coast 
Showcase. Friday night, they are 
set to play No. 21 Missouri (3-1) in 
the tournament’s opening round.
Program-wise, 
the 
Tigers 
are a step up from the squads 
Michigan faced the last three 
games. They are coming off a 
24-8 season that culminated in 
their third consecutive NCAA 

Tournament appearance, where 
they lost in the first round to 
Florida Gulf Coast.
Missouri returns three capable 
starters from last season — guards 
Sophie 
Cunningham, 
Amber 
Smith and Lauren Aldridge — all 
of whom are upperclassmen.
Cunningham led the team 
in scoring last year, averaging 
18.5 points while boasting an 
impressive 54.2 percent clip from 
the field, and currently puts up 
16.3 points a night. She is the 
engine of her team’s offense.
Smith is also a key offensive 
contributor, posting 13.5 points 
a game, while Aldridge led the 
Tigers in assists last season. 
Combining those three veterans 
will create a challenge for the 
Wolverines’ young backcourt of 
freshman guard Amy Dilk and 
sophomore guard Deja Church.
Missouri also has two talented 
freshmen, forward Grace Berg 
and guard Akira Levy. The 

former was a five-star recruit; 
the latter, a four-star. Both have 
logged significant playing time.
The Tigers aren’t without fault, 
though. Following their first two 
games, they were ranked 16th 
in the nation but then fell after 
losing to Green Bay. That loss was 
primarily due to poor shooting.
Michigan 
has 
the 
height 
advantage, which has helped 
the team succeed so far. Nobody 
has been able to stop 6-foot-
5 senior center Hallie Thome 
from 
dominating 
the 
paint. 
The Wolverines are also the 
better shooting team, as they’ve 
converted 51.5 percent from the 
field for 11th in the country.
Much of the shooting success 
can be credited to freshman 
forward Naz Hillmon, who has 
drained 23 of 27 shots on the 
year. Right now, she’s the most 
efficient shooter in the nation. 
During the Wolverines’ 95-62 
victory against Detroit Mercy on 

Monday night, she dropped 22 
points while also spearheading 
the defensive press.
“I think Naz is incredible,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico 
after 
Monday’s 
game. 
“When you have that type of size 
and length upfront, I really think 
she’s able to pressure people and 
get it going from the top.”
Added 
Hillmon: 
“It 
was 
awesome. It gives me a lot of 
confidence knowing that my 
coach, as soon as I get into the 
game, trusts to put me at the 
top of that press. It gives me 
confidence that my teammates 
and my coaches believe in me and 
it makes me want to work harder 
on both ends of the ball.”
It’s hard to judge how good 
Barnes Arico’s team is because 
it hasn’t faced a real test yet. 
But Friday’s matchup against a 
ranked opponent will provide the 
perfect opportunity to see just 
how well the Wolverines fare.

An unselfish play to define top-line chemistry

Most players, when presented 
the opportunity, would go for the 
goal.
Not Will Lockwood.
The junior forward stared 
straight down the 
empty net in front 
of him and cocked 
back 
his 
stick. 
Instead of skating 
in and shooting 
the 
puck, 
he 
instead gave it up 
to junior forward 
Jake Slaker, who 
proceeded 
to 
score.
Think that was 
unselfish?
Now imagine that empty-
netter Lockwood had passed up 
was the dagger to end a come-
from-behind win against a top-
five team in the nation.
Because in the No. 16 Michigan 
hockey team’s 6-4 win over No. 5 
Penn State Friday, that’s exactly 

what happened. And there didn’t 
seem to be any room for unselfish 
play.
“It just goes to show the 
character and type of person 
that Will is. Really unselfish play, 
passed it to me for the empty net,” 
Slaker said. “He made the play, 
and 
I 
haven’t 
stopped 
to 
think, not just 
necessarily 
for 
giving me the 
goal, but just the 
unselfishness he 
displayed there.”
Slaker 
couldn’t describe 
what had exactly 
happened 
and 
struggled to find 
the 
words 
to 
explain it.
“You don’t see that often in 
sports, an unselfish play like that,” 
Slaker said.
But the situation presented 
itself.
Right before the goal, the 
Nittany Lions had made a push to 

tie the game at 5-5, but Lockwood 
skated in front of the shot and 
blocked it. With the loose puck 
leaking out, Lockwood took it and 
skated down the ice.
There was little time to think. 
Right behind them were Penn 
State defenders looking to deny 
the 
easy 
goal 
and 
keep 
the 
game close. But 
Lockwood 
and 
Slaker, with the 
early start, didn’t 
relent.
“Him 
and 
I 
were on a clear 
two-on-(none),” 
Slaker said. “And 
I think we were 
both 
trying 
to 
skate as fast as 
we could just so we wouldn’t get 
caught. And he could have easily 
kept on skating it and put it in the 
net but he just passed it over to me 
and made the easiest play, and we 
got rewarded for it.”
And as much as it defined 
Lockwood, he is not the only one 

who would have made that play. 
It’s the mentality that the team is 
trying to incorporate, to show the 
quality of players the Wolverines 
have on the team.
“I’ve seen instances where a 
guy won’t pass the puck,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“He’ll just go on 
and shoot it. I 
think it says a lot 
about the kind of 
teammates you 
have, but in this 
case, it says a lot 
about Will and 
his unselfishness 
and 
the 
team 
player 
he 
is. 
I 
think 
that’s 
a 
good 
thing 
for 
your 
team, it helps build your team’s 
camaraderie and trust in that.”
If it had been Slaker in that 
situation to choose between an 
easy empty-net goal or a pass to 
a teammate, he would have done 
the same thing.
“He’s one of my best friends 
on the team, and we have really 
good chemistry on and off the 
ice and just shows what type of 
person he is,” Slaker said. “And it 
meant a lot to me. Like I said, I’d 
do the same situation if I had that. 
If I could give him that, I’d give it 
right back.”
Added Lockwood: “I’ve played 
with Jake a lot, and I think he 
would do the same thing for me. 
I think it was more about just 
setting an example of how we 
need to play as a team. We’ve 
gotta be thinking of the guy next 
to us and not just ourselves.”
It’s an example for the rest 
of the fourth-youngest team in 
the nation to follow. As Pearson 
noted, a person has to be willing 
to put aside personal goals and 
agendas to be part of a team, and 
on Friday, no one exemplified that 
mentality better than Lockwood.
“You can tell. If you don’t like 
a guy or something, you probably 
don’t pass it to him,” Pearson 
joked. “But they have chemistry. I 
just think that just speaks to who 
they are and what they’re trying 
to 
accomplish 
together. 
And 
they’re in it for each other and not 
just themselves.”

The Price of Experience:

Unpaid internships and the student job market


W

hen we founded Affordable 
Michigan 
— 
formerly 
known as the Michigan 
Affordability and Advocacy Coalition 
— we were attempting to address a need 
that is twofold: An institutional need 
for University of Michigan policies that 
accommodate low-income students and 
a social need for low-income students 
to connect with one another and build 
organizational capacity. In our first 
semester as an organization, we have 
worked to pinpoint which aspects of the 
University’s rhetoric on socioeconomic 
inclusion are the most dissonant with 
how its policies and its distribution of 
resources actually impact the student 
population.
This brought us very quickly to 
the 
problems 
surrounding 
unpaid 
and poorly-paid internships, how the 
University provides funding and how 
many students are still left without 
the financial and community support 
they need. For many low-income and/
or first-generation college students, 
the idea of working for free or next-to-
nothing seems completely unintuitive. 
The experience, connections and 
resume bullet points unpaid internships 
provide do not pay the bills. In fact, 
they create bills. When considering the 
cost of working for free, covering living 
expenses and potentially moving to a 
large, expensive city for the duration 
of the internship, the completion of 
an unpaid internship becomes less a 
result of genuine merit and instead 
the product of supplementary funds 
and connections. This is especially 
troublesome considering the value 
entry-level positions in many fields 
place on unpaid internships completed 

while in college. College students (who 
are able to do so) complete these unpaid 
internships year after year because 
getting one’s foot in the door of their 
career is sometimes next to impossible 
without them.
The 
University’s 
$11 
billion 
endowment makes it one of the 
wealthiest universities in the country, 
and 
programs 
such 
as 
the 
LSA 
Opportunity Hub, the Public Service 
Intern Program, the LSA Internship 
Fund and the internship funds that 
virtually every University school and 
department offer, attempt to provide 
both 
the 
institutional 
knowledge 
required to obtain an internship and 
the money necessary to complete 
one. Overall, University students can 
access far more resources than most 
when it comes to this type of support, 
and the scholarships and counselling 
available are a main reason students 
apply to universities like Michigan 
in the first place. However, as unpaid 
internships are one of the main ways 
not-rich students are excluded from 
certain careers, it is important to listen 
to students navigating this process 
to see if their needs are being met. 
We hope the following testimonies 
from Monica Kim, Lydia Murray and 
Zachary Tingley about the difficulties 
they have faced during the unpaid 
internship experiences despite being 
University students help to illuminate 
this problem.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | NOVEMBER 21, 2018


Wednesday, November 21, 2018// The Statement 
3B

L

ike many University of Michigan 
students, I am from the deep 
Midwest, in a district likely 
dubbed 
“Trump 
Country, 
USA” 
by 
coastal reporters. My father has worked 
in manufacturing his entire life. Unlike 
many of my peers, my parents didn’t go to 
college, nor are they in an income bracket 
to finance any of my college experience. 
Because of this, I wasn’t able to acquire 
a Capitol Hill internship by riding the 
coattails of my parents’ wealth or social 
capital, but my family’s working-class 
background drew me to public service.
During the summer after high school 
graduation, I worked at a factory 
assembling chairs and other odd bits of 
furniture. The next summer I worked 
in the same factory as my dad, where I 
assisted in the production of countertops. 
While these summers didn’t give me as 
many resume bullet points as my D.C. 
internship did, they enabled me to save 
money for the school year — somewhat of 
a necessity for low-income students.
I remember feeling so frustrated 
my second summer at home. Many 
of my new college friends spent their 
summers working impressive internships, 
honing 
their 
professional 
interests 
and networking in large cities. It was 
disappointing to spend the summer in my 
small Ohio town.
This feeling of failure stuck with 
me during my sophomore year. I spent 
countless hours applying to internships, 
curating my resume and using the few 
connections I had to try and find an 
opening.
While 
several 
unpaid 
internship 
opportunities did come up, they didn’t 
seem feasible for me. The logistics of 
a summer internship create a large 
psychological barrier when you don’t even 
know how you’re going to pay for it. How 
was I going to find housing? How will I 
pay for a plane ticket? I’ll probably need to 
purchase more professional clothing, but 
how much will that be? These questions 
persuaded me to skip out on any internship 
experience entirely, and I worked in a 
University Housing position that summer. 
The free room and board allowed me to 
skip another summer at home in a factory 
and I found work as a research assistant.
The following summer, I made the 
finances work, but just barely. With the 
help of the Public Service Internship 
Program 
and 
additional 
resume 
experience from my research position, 
I landed an internship in the United 
States Congress. Like most internships 
on Capitol Hill, mine was unpaid. 
Even after a generous stipend from the 
LSA Opportunity Hub (they gave me 
MORE than I asked for), the expense of 
accommodation covered by the Office 
of Financial Aid and several birthday 

gifts in the form of money from friends 
and family, I still walked away from the 
experience with debt. I ultimately was on 
my own financially, just like each summer 
before. This time, though, I had no source 
of income.
I 

arrived in D.C. with less than 
$50 to my name, as the stipend 
arrived the week after settling 
into D.C. While it was helpful to have 
something, the stipend I received from 
the Opportunity Hub barely paid for 
my sunk rent back in Ann Arbor. Each 
month I paid $640 for a house I wasn’t 
living in — its location far from campus 
didn’t make it a desirable spot for those 
interested in subletting. The flights to 
and from D.C., daily Metro fares and 
grocery shopping all further abused 
my wallet — oftentimes I charged my 
credit to pay for groceries. While I could 
splurge on a few dinners or happy hours, 
I meal prepped most weeks — consuming 
plenty of peanut butter and jelly 
sandwiches and other cheap meals and 
sometimes skipped events with friends 
to save money.
The 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. days and their 
accompanying commute left little time 
to pick up a side job. Despite this reality, 
halfway through the summer I was filled 
with self-doubt that I wasn’t trying 
harder to find a way to make money. That 
said, I’m glad to have gained such an 
experience––my resume appreciates the 
facelift––and I truly enjoyed the work. 
It was worth it, but it was a financial 
nightmare.

During the second week of sorting 
mail-sorting and running errands, I 
received a phone call from my father. My 
mother, who has had Type 1 diabetes for 
almost 14 years, was in the hospital. She 
was in a diabetic ketoacidosis coma for 
9 days. What led to her hospitalization 
is a story familiar across the country: 
Financial burdens and the high cost 
of medication had been restricting my 
parents from purchasing the insulin she 
needed to survive. She opted to ration 
her supplies rather than buying the 
necessary amounts our family couldn’t 
afford. Chronic lack of supplies led her 
to the emergency room that morning. 
The intensive care unit doctor receiving 
her said her body’s readings were 

“incompatible with human life.” She 
nearly died.
During the weeks following her 
initial trip to the hospital, I tried to 
contextualize the implications of her 
near-death experience. First, it was hard 
not to politicize her hospitalization. 
A genuine financial constraint and 
inadequate American health care system 
put her in the hospital. Again, I was 
angry. Not at myself, but at the context of 
the entire situation.

Few 
working-class 
students 
are 
entangled in the web of well-connected, 
affluent students working in the Capitol 
Building. Hill intern affluence was 
physically evident: 18 to 22-year-olds 
purchasing $13 lunches daily, sporting 
Louis Vuitton tote bags, Cartier bracelets 
or Tory Burch sandals. At the same time, 
their more intangible characteristics 
shed wealth as well — children of 
lawyers, dentists, professors — many 
of whom were educated at Ivy League 
schools. It was evident I was an odd one 
out, and my mother’s hospitalization 
made this even more clear.
Most of us aren’t the children of 
doctors and lawyers. Most of us can’t 
afford expensive clothing. (Many days 
during my internship I felt like Nathan 

Fielder, in a not-so-perfectly fitting 
suit with a broken button.) While these 
students are well-intentioned in their 
commitments to public service, they are 
also likely well-insured. When I pleaded 
with my upper-middle-class, liberal 
friends the necessity of “Medicare 
for All,” they still find excuses not to 
address the health care issue, unable 
to relate to my family’s struggle. When 
you’re not directly affected by the policy 
you’re interested in changing, it’s just an 
abstraction you’re allowed to disconnect 
from at the end of the day.
My mother is still bouncing back, but 
doing much better. It had been scary, 
especially while I was halfway across 
the country. After grappling with this 
frustration, I look back and wonder if the 
internship was worth the financial stress 
I put myself through. Before I purchased 
my plane tickets to D.C., I remember 
hearing, “It will be worth it, it pays in 
experience!” over and over again.
While I do think it was worth the 
experience gained, the context of my 
situation makes me we wonder who we 
are inviting into the realm of political 
jobs. I went into debt for my internship 
even with the financial support I 
received from the University, and it took 
two years of internship hunting to feel 
comfortable enough to take the plunge 
into an unpaid position.
We 
need 
to 
have 
an 
honest 
conversation about who is invited to 
participate in policymaking. For too 
many policymakers and staff, their 
wealth safeguards them from their own 
legislation. This needs to change. A first 
step is ensuring all people irrespective 
of class background have the ability to 
afford access to these internships.

O

n a sweltering day 
in 
Washington, 
D.C., the 8:30 a.m. 
Metro rush hour is filled with 
college students wearing a 
range of business casual to 
formal clothing, a lanyard 
and photo ID hanging around 
their necks. Knowing D.C., 
with its crowd of “Hillterns” 
and non-profit interns, most 
of these students are probably 
off 
to 
their 
unpaid 
gig. 
Probably the minority receive 
any payment, much less a 
stipend for transportation or 
housing.
Eight and a half hours 
later: Cue the 5:00 p.m. rush. 
The same students have left 
their buildings — perhaps 
a tie is loosened, high heels 
switched for sneakers — and 
the Metro is full of bodies 
pressed against one another, 
trying to find a space on their 
way home, trying not to fall 
over as the Metro careens to 
an abrupt stop. As everyone 
rushes off their last stop to 
get home, I get off mine to 
walk to my next job for a six-
hour shift at Anthropologie 
after an eight-hour one at my 
unpaid internship. 

I

t’s not that I didn’t 
receive any financial 
support 
from 
the 
University of Michigan — in 
fact, I was really lucky to 
receive more from an LSA 
scholarship than I expected 
— but it wasn’t able to cover 
all of my expenses in D.C. 
Hence, the second job at 
Anthropologie. I still had to 
think about the rent I had to 
pay for my off-campus house 
in Ann Arbor, my future rent 
for the school year and saving 
up for loans. You get the idea. 
And while my internship 
gave 
us 
a 
$50 
monthly 
stipend for transportation, 
it wasn’t enough to cover my 
transportation costs (thanks, 
Metro peak pricing!).
So 
while 
I 
had 
been 
applying for LSA scholarships 
for my internship, I was also 
applying for jobs in D.C. I 
arrived two weeks prior to 
the start of my internship 
to interview for a paid job, 
and luckily, I got the first 
and only one I interviewed 
for, at Anthropologie. Since 
my internship was set for 
25 hours per week — the 
nonprofit was very flexible 
with our hours — I asked for 

20 at Anthropologie.
For 
anyone 
who’s 
ever 
worked in food service or 
retail before, you’ll know that 
employers always schedule 
you for more hours than you 
asked for. And so it came as no 
surprise that Anthropologie 

scheduled me for more than 
20 hours per week, sometimes 
creeping close to 30.
It wasn’t often that I’d 
have to go straight from 
my internship to my retail 
job. Most of the time, I’d be 
working six days a week, 
eight and a half for three days 
at my internship, nine for 
three days at Anthropologie. 
I still managed to squeeze 
some time to go to the free 
museums in D.C. and some 

other touristy things, but I 
was always exhausted.
Because I was working 
part-time at my internship, 
I often felt like I would 
be missing out on making 
personal 
and 
professional 
connections on the days that 
I wasn’t there. I wasn’t able 
to go to any of the happy 
hours 
that 
the 
nonprofit 
hosted because I’d always be 
scheduled at Anthropologie 
during those times, and this 
too added to my sense of 
missing out on opportunities.
Looking back, it all sounds 
pretty silly, but at the time 
my FOMO got the better of 
me and made me feel like 
these kinds of events were 
essential for networking and 
thinking about future career 
opportunities, 
and 
that 
missing them would take me a 
step backward from everyone 
else. I realize now that this is 
an exaggeration.
There were days, of course, 
when I wish I didn’t have to 
take on a second job in order 
to support myself with an 
unpaid internship. My mom 

works two jobs seven days 
a week all year-round. I 
couldn’t even fathom doing 
so for more than a summer, 
and I have no idea how some 
students at the University 
juggle two jobs with a full 
course load throughout the 
school year. I can barely 
handle one.
There were days when 
I wish I pursued studies 
in a field where they were 
guaranteed to give you a paid 

internship. 
Hearing 
from 
my friends about their paid 
computer science internships, 
paid engineering internships 
and paid laboratory research 
internships made me jealous, 
though I never told them this, 
nor admitted it to myself.
There were days when I 
reminded myself that I was 
lucky and privileged to have 
an internship in the first 
place since there can be so 
many barriers to obtaining 
one. Who was I to complain 
about interning and working 
and living in D.C., when so 
many cannot afford to do so? 
Who was I to complain when 
the situation of juggling two 
jobs temporarily was the 
daily reality for so many?
My experience is certainly 
not unique to what nearly 
all low-income, and some 
middle-income students like 
myself, have to face when 
deciding to pursue that unpaid 
internship. 
I 
knew 
three 
other people who also took 
on a second job in addition 
to their unpaid internship 
this summer. Having that 
knowledge made me feel less 
alone, and yet I was always 
aware that it seemed like 
there were fewer of us who 
had to do this in comparison 
to those who could afford to 
get by with just an unpaid 
summer internship.
Finding internships for the 
summer is stressful. It’s that 
time of year when I need to 
start making plans for the 
summer again, editing my 
resume and thinking about 
what paid job I would need 
to get if I am accepted in an 
unpaid internship, or if I 
am not. In the midst of the 
holidays and looming finals, it 
all seems overwhelming — but 
if I made it through last year, 
made it through a 25-minute 
walk to Anthropologie in 
the humid, suffocating heat 
after an eight-hour day at my 
internship — then I can make 
it through again.

Two jobs, one paycheck

BY MONICA KIM, CONTRIBUTOR

For anyone who’s ever worked 

in food service or retail before, 

you’ll know that employers always 

schedule you for more hours than 

you asked for.

I

n one of the first weeks of my 
summer 
at 
the 
Democratic 
Congressional 
Campaign 
Committee in Washington D.C., 
the chairman came down to introduce 
himself to the interns. When introducing 
ourselves he asked the interns to answer 
“how we found the DCCC, or how the 
DCCC found us.” As my fellow interns went 
around the room, I quickly realized that my 
story was not like the rest of my peers.
“My aunt is a major political influencer 
and she connected me.”
“My brother used to work here.”
“My mother is a Congresswoman.”
My answer: I had applied online and 
decided to accept the offer. No one flagged 
my resume or knew me before I had arrived. 
Before I arrived in D.C., I had no exposure 
to the networking-based job market, which 
often blurs the lines between professional 
connections and nepotism. My dad grew 
up lower-middle class and my mom 
immigrated from China just a year before 
I was born. I had no family connections in 
D.C. who could set me up for a job like so 
many of my peers.

Another thing the other interns had 
in common: They were wealthy and 
mostly white. In a class of 22 interns, four 
(including myself) were people of color. 
My peers ate sushi and purchased food 
for lunch every day, while I budgeted 
$25 a week for groceries. They lived in 
townhouses in Georgetown, while I had a 
room smaller than my freshman dorm 
with three other girls on bunk beds.
I knew that this internship 
would be unpaid when I was 
selected for it. I had worked for 
the year before with 
the 
goal of saving for the 
summer. I made a 
budget. I picked the 
cheapest housing I 
could find. So when I 
arrived in D.C., I felt 
relatively 
prepared 
to 
live 
frugally 
but 
ready 
to 
survive in 
 

the city. But I wasn’t prepared for the 
culture shock of the D.C. world of unpaid 
internships.
There were often points in conversation 
where I felt uncomfortable, like the odd 
one out. This was my first exposure to 
Washington and its East Coast elitism. 
The interns I worked with were nice and 
talented, but they came from a different 
world than I did. They all had pictures of 
themselves with famous politicians from 
fundraisers their parents were invited to 
and grew up talking politics, whereas my 
family never did those things.
I also was not the only one who felt 
this way. Another intern (who also 
goes to the University of Michigan) 
became my ally in the organization, 
as we were both Midwestern Asians 
in the political elite environment. 
Often we would lock eyes when one 
of our colleagues said something 
controversial or strange with a 
mutual understanding of our 
circumstance.
It 
was 
in 
this 
environment 
that 
I 
realized that something 
needed to be done. 
Someone had to step 
up and point out that 
not everyone had the 
same opportunities 
in 
this 
unpaid 
structure, that the 
unpaid 
nature 
of the internship 
prevents 
lower-
income 
and 
diverse candidates 
from working in 
an 
organization 
and for a party that 

prides itself on representing those groups.
Thus began my crusade to create 
a paid internship program at the DCCC.
I reached out to an organization called 
Pay Our Interns, who had just secured 
funding for interns in the Senate. They 
suggested that I draft a letter to the 
DCCC leaders urging them to start a paid 
internship program and have other interns 
sign on, which I did. Most of my peers 
supported the effort and signed on, though 
a few were hesitant and feared backlash.
In the end, the letter picked up some 
traction in the press and the DCCC agreed 
to begin paying their interns in the future.
This victory was not personal. I didn’t 
get paid from this, nor did I earn any 
significant praise for leading this charge, 
and I didn’t want any of that. If people 
bring it up nowadays, I tend to brush it off 
as just sort of something that happened 
without boasting. This article isn’t meant 
to brag about some accomplishment of 
mine. Instead, I hope to convey the message 
of why unpaid internships are harmful 
to lower-income students, as they grant 
opportunities only to those who can afford 
them.
If we want to make significant change in 
Washington then the people who have the 
opportunity to get their foot in the door 
here with increasingly essential internships 
cannot just be rich white people. Even the 
well-intentioned and qualified rich people, 
like those at the DCCC, cannot truly 
understand the perspectives of those from 
lower-income or minority communities, 
and that gets reflected in their policies.
Paid 
internships 
are 
essential 
to 
increasing representation in Washington 
and providing opportunities to all young 
people. I am proud of the DCCC — and now 
Congress — for taking action to pay interns.

long 
with 
aca-
demics 
and 
extracurricu-
lars, 
internships 
are critical for students to 
gain 
workforce 
skills 
and 
launch their career. Natu-
rally, this often creates a 
problematic dynamic where 
students 
want 
employment 
more than employers need 
student interns, which some-
times leads to students pay-
ing to work. With around 40 
percent of national intern-
ship 
opportunities 
being 
unpaid, it is sometimes dif-
ficult for students to accept 

such opportunities as their 
financial burden can some-
times outweigh their benefits. 
According to the National 
Association of Colleges and 
Employers, hiring rates for 
students who chose to com-
plete an unpaid internship 
are only 2 percent higher than 
those who did not acquire 
an internship at all, appar-
ently offering only a small 
benefit 
for 
students 
who 
took an unpaid internship. 
This contrasts with another 
study that found that 60 per-
cent of employers expressed 
a preference for applicants 

who have had internships.
According to the Depart-
ment 
of 
Labor’s 
“primary 
beneficiaries 
test,” 
unpaid 
internships should only be 
legal if it can be deemed that 
the student is the primary ben-
eficiary of the intern-employer 
relationship. This is measured 
by comparing the unpaid work 
to classroom activities, see-
ing that the student is com-
pensated via academic credit 
and making sure there was no 
understanding between the 
student and employer that the 
opportunity would be paid.
Nonetheless, a 2014 Pro-

Publica investigation found 
that the Department of Labor 
doesn’t 
aggressively 
pur-
sue complaints about wage 

violations when the intern-
ships

complaints have been filed rather 
than proactively investigating them.
That said, employment in some 
fields is so competitive that unpaid 
internships are increasingly neces-
sary, particularly in journalism and 
public policy. Between 2016 and 2026, 
journalism is projected to have a 2 
percent decline in job opportunities. 
On campus, University of Michigan 
offices such as the University Career 
Center and the Opportunity Hub 
attempt to facilitate ways for students 
to take advantage of unpaid intern-
ships with a vast array of program-
ming. Joelle Fundaro Randall, an 
assistant director at the Career Cen-
ter, said that though students may 
be insistent about getting unpaid 
internships, there are other oppor-
tunities that offer the same rewards.
“If I am connecting with a student 
and they are really focused on the 
internship, I say let’s pause for a sec-
ond, there are other ways of getting 

these opportunities to help you develop 
your skills outside of a formal intern-
ship,” Randall said. “Sometimes there 
is research on campus, student groups 
that do a lot of different things and 
are part of a community. Those skills 
are transferable into the workplace.”
Outside of coaching, the Career 
Center offers resources for students 
to find paid internships or to acquire 
the means to be able to financially 
accept an unpaid position. For exam-
ple, the Public Service Intern Pro-
gram coaches students on how to 
attain opportunities in Washington 
D.C. Alongside PSIP, they also offer 
the 
Applebaum 
Internship 
which 
allows students to find opportunities 
in Detroit, and the Samo Alajbegović 

Fellowship for students working in 
the countries on the Adriatic Sea.
The Career Center also invites every 
student who is registered through the 
Office of the Registrar, including mas-
ter’s degree and Ph.D. students, to their 
online employment database, Hand-
shake. Fundaro Randall expressed 
that the Career Center has about 
3,700 paid internships in their system.
“I think the biggest piece is students 
not knowing where to look for intern-
ships, so when we coach students, if they 
mention that they are low SES (socio-
economic status) or any of those piec-
es, we coach them on how to find these 
opportunities,” Fundaro Randall said. 
The Hub partners with LSA Scholar-
ships to help students on a need-based 
basis and they also, like the Career 
Center, have drop-in coaching hours 
in which students have conversations 
with coaches that have resources like 
scholarships, stipends and knowl-
edge of other opportunities at hand.

Yet, as the testimonies of University 
students Zach Tingley, Monica Kim 
and Lydia Murray show, sometimes 
students’ interests are in fields where 
very few paid internships are offered, 
and the assistance of a scholarship from 
the University isn’t always sufficient. 
According to CNBC, an unpaid 
internship could cost up to $12,986 
and 
students 
with 
insufficient 
funds might be forced to obtain 
a second job or go into debt to be 
able to afford these opportunities. 
On the other hand, LSA junior Tay-
lor Lind talks positively about her 
experience with an unpaid internship 
and the LSA Internship Scholarship. 
“It was the summer after my fresh-
man year I didn’t really know what 

I wanted to do. I knew I wanted to 
work 
in 
environmental 
advocacy 
and I didn’t know how,” Lind said. 
“I thought that working for govern-
ment might be a good option, so I 
reached out to my local city govern-
ment. I wanted to see if they had any 
opportunities but I didn’t see anything 
posted so I had to cold contact and I 
did it with the help of the Hub since 
I was an employee there at the time.” 
When she was finally hired by 
her local government for the intern-
ship position and they told her it 
would be an unpaid opportunity, she 
decided to apply for the LSA Intern-
ship Scholarship and was granted 
$1,500 to cover her expenses while 
working for her local government 
in California and living at home. 
“Although I am not necessarily going 
into government, I learned so much 
about how the environmental efforts 
can be integrated and the barriers that 
they face,” Lind said. “I really value the 
knowledge that I gained from it and 
… The fact that it was unpaid (didn’t 
take away from the experience).”
However, a common theme of con-
fusion and misinformation came out 
while talking to representatives of both 
the Career Center and the LSA Oppor-
tunity Hub. Lind expressed that she 
had contacts in LSA Scholarships while 
she was applying and suggested that, 
though she isn’t sure, other students 
that don’t have that may have some 
confusion in the application process.
There are differing opinions regard-
ing unpaid internships. Some com-
panies view them as necessary to 
their vitality as organizations, but 
some others, such as Conde Nast, are 
known to use their interns as unskilled
