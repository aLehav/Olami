Protesters were lined up
Thursday night to condemn the
Ford School of Public Policy's.
guest speaker John Negroponte,
a former director of national
intelligence, deputy secretary of
state and currently a professor

at Yale University.
Public Policy Prof. Melvyn
Levitsky, who previously served
terms as the U.S. ambassa-
dor to Brazil and Bulgaria, led
the event, which discussed
Negroponte's work. Following
the discussion, a vigil awaited
Negroponte outside the Annen-
berg Auditorium to chastise
Negroponte's alleged crimes.
Negroponte served as an
ambassador to Honduras, Iraq,
Mexico, the Philippines and the
United Nations. The discussion
was largely about Negroponte's
career and his leadership posi-
tions.
During the discussion,

Negroponte said the United
States often gets too involved
in international issues, and said
other nations are able to find
stability on their own.
"Based on my experience in
the foreign policy, I don't think
we're too good at nation-build-
ing," he said. "I don't think we
do that quite very well. I don't
think we are too good at regime
change."
Negroponte, ambassador to
Iraq from May 2004 to 2005,
questioned whether the inva-
sion in Iraq happened too soon.
He was also very critical of tor-
ture as a means of extracting
information. He denied that

there were covert torture cen-
ters while he was in Iraq and
referred to Abu Ghraib - the
prison in Iraq where members
of the U.S. military and the
CIA tortured inmates in 2003
and 2004 - as "a great humili-
ation and embarrassment to the
United States." He added that
was not sanctioned by the gov-
ernment.
"If you want your troops to
be treated properly under the
Geneva Convention you better
treat other people likewise," he
said.
Negroponte said his tenure

lawyer questions
board's commitment
to Open Meetings Act
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
While the monthly meet-
ings of the University's Board of
Regents could be considered effi-
cient, complaints have recently
been surfacing that the Univer-
sity's governing body is abusing
Michigan's Open Meetings Act.
At the open and public meet-
ings, held by the regents, mem-
bers and executive officers
address and pass new policies
for the University and offer an
opportunity for the public to
share thoughts or concerns, as
required by law. However, the
regents rarely publicly disagree
with one another at the meet-
ings or even make statements for
the record. Most discussions are
assumed to occur behind closed
doors and in informal sessions.
According to Section 3 of
Michigan's Open Meetings Act,
"all meetings of a public body
shall be open to the public and

shall be held in a place available
to the general public."
On Tuesday, Feb. 18, state Rep.
Tom McMillin (R-Rochester
Hills) held a legislative hearing
before the Michigan House of
Representatives Committee to
listen to the public's general con-
cerns about the act.
Herschel Fink, one of the
Detroit Free Press' legal coun-
sel and a speaker at the hearing,
stated publicly that the regents
are "serial abusers of the open
Meetings Act."
Fink called for a constitutional
amendment to make clear that
the regents, as well as the Board
of Trustees at Michigan State
University and the Board of Gov-
ernors at Wayne State University,
are bound by the Open Meetings
Act and Freedom of Information
Act.
"The quote-unquote 'formal
monthly meetings' are nearly
perfunctory," Fink said. "They
simply rubber-stamp the regents'
work committees to which the
public is not allowed to partici-
pate or be present."
Fink is not the first to com-
plain about the regents' secrecy.
In 2010, University alum Rob-
ert Davis sued the regents for not

Dean of School

national award

SPEAK OUT

Loewenberg Ball
helped create
program to train
new teachers
ByYARDAIN AMRON
Daily Staff Reporter
Deborah Loewenberg Ball,
dean of the School of Education,
received the 2014 Edward C.
Pomeroy Award for Outstand-
ing Contributions to Teacher
Education, the University
announced Thursday.
The award will be presented
Monday by the American Asso-
ciation of Colleges for Teacher
Education - a national alliance
of public and private colleges
and universities dedicated to
educator training - at its 66th
annual meetingin Indianapolis.
Loewenberg Ball said she was
notified about the award via
e-mail a few weeks ago.
"I was very surprised,
extremelyhonored - it's a major
organization of all the institu-
tions in the country that prepare
teachers - so it's just a very big
honor because there are about
1,400 different universities that
prepare teachers," Loewenberg
Ball said. "It's a very nice rec-
ognition of the amount of work
we've been doing here at Michi-
gan."
Gail Bozeman, vice presi-

dent of meetings and events at
AACTE, said the award is very
prestigious and that Loewen-
berg Ball is a more than deserv-
ingrecipient.
"Part of the award deals with
recognizing outstanding con-
tributions to teacher education,
especially around an individual
or an institution that may have
produced or developed materials
that will promote more effective
methods of teacher education at
the collegiate level," Bozeman
said.
Bozeman said out of 14 can-
didates, Loewenberg Ball stood
out for her notable involvement
in numerous national teaching
initiatives including Teaching-
Works, an organization dedi-
cated to improving the quality of
new teachers.
Loewenberg Ball said his-
torically, first- and second-year
teachers often report learning
the bulk of their skills only upon
entering the classroom.
"What TeachingWorks is set-
ting out to do is to say that kids
really deserve to have skillful
teaching every year that they're
in school, and people who agree
to become teachers deserve to
be trained well enough to be
responsible for children," she
said.
TeachingWorks is dedicated
to. three main pillars: defining

tices a new teacher needs before

$700,000 plan is on

transit services
ByEMMA KERR
Daily Staff Reporter
The debate continues over the
expansion of the Ann Arbor Area
Transportation Authority.
The future of the AATA's ser-
vices is hinged on a proposed
$700,000 millage that will appear
on the May 6 ballot in three Washt-
enaw County communities. While
the "More Buses" campaign cham-
pions connecting people and better
serving Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and
Ypsilanti Township, the opposing
campaign, "Better Transit Now,"
questions whether expanding the
current system of transit is best
when there may be other - and
potentially better -alternatives.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) and councilmember Chuck
Warpehoski (D-Ward 5) support
the referendum while other coun-
cilmembers remain undecided in
the matter. The referendum boasts
a 44-percent increase in transit

CAMPUS EVENTS & NOTES

"Fight"fAlls
BY ALLEN DONNE
Kid Cudi's new album,
"Satellite Flight" is less than
promising. Rather than
hip-hop, the genre of this
album is disappointingly
indeterminant. Even worse,
he attempts throughout
the album to showcase
production involvement and
half the album features odd,
space-like instrumentals.
Oscar favorites
BY CONRAD FOREMAN AND
MAYANKMATHUR
According to these
movie-watchers, the
winning film for Best
Picture should be either "12
Years a Slave" or "Gravity."
The overwhelming favorite
for Best Actor is Christian
Bale, although Matthew
McConaughey is also a
fierce competitor here.

"True Detective"
BYCHLOEGILKE
and AKSHAY SETH
The latest episode of
"True Detective" was weaker
than previous episodes this
season. Even so, the episode
was vital to the plot, and it
showed both protagonists
coming full circle. Maggie's
character, however, did not
show any new development.

California governor Jerry
Brown to seek re-election

75-year-old
incumbent hopes to
continue to tackle
challenges in office
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Cali-
fornia Gov. Jerry Brown formally
launched his re-election cam-
paign Thursday, stepping into a
contest that the former three-
time presidential candidate is ex-
pected to dominate.
The announcement was un-

posted on his website, with an
accompanying tweet - in keep-
ing with Brown's reputation for
shoestring-style politicking. The
75-year-old Democrat said he had
filed required paperwork to seek
the office and was ready to deal
with a raft of pressing issues, from
a potentially devastating drought
to a pension system mired in long-
term debt.

Russian military stirs
chaos in Crimea after
country establishes
new government
SIMFEROPOL, Ukraine (AP)
- Masked gunmen stormed parlia-
ment in Ukraine's strategic Crimea
region Thursday as Russian fighter
jets scrambled to patrol borders,
the stirrings of a potentially dan-
gerous confrontation reminiscent
of Cold War brinksmanship.
While a newly formed govern-
ment led by a pro-Western tech-
nocrat in Kiev pledged to prevent
any national breakup, there were
mixed signals in Moscow: Russia
granted shelter to Ukraine's fugi-
tive president, Viktor Yanukovych,
while pledging to respect Ukraine's
territorial integrity.
Yanukovych was said to be holed
up in a luxury government retreat
and to have scheduled a news con-
ference Friday near the Ukrainian
border.
As gunmen wearing unmarked
camouflage uniforms erected a
sign reading "Crimea is Russia" in
the provincial capital, Ukraine's in-
terim prime minister declared the
Black Sea territory "has been and
will be a part of Ukraine."

The escalating conflict sent
Ukraine's finances plummeting fur-
ther, prompting Western leaders to
prepare an emergency financial
package.
Yanukovych, whose abandon-
ment of closer ties to Europe in
favor of a bailout loan from Russia
set off three months of protests,
finally fled by helicopter last week
as his allies deserted him. The hu-
miliating exit was a severe blow to
Russian President Vladimir Putin,
who had been celebrating his sig-
nature Olympics even as Ukraine's
drama came to a head. The Russian
leader has long dreamed of pulling
Ukraine - a country of 46 million
people considered the cradle of
Russian civilization - closer into
Moscow's orbit.
For Ukraine's neighbors, the
specter of Ukraine breaking up
evoked memories of centuries of
bloody conflict.
"Regional conflicts begin this
way," said Polish Foreign Minis-
ter Radoslaw Sikorski, calling the
confrontation "a very dangerous
game."
Russia has pledged to respect
Ukraine's territorial integrity But
the dispatch of Russian fighter
jets Thursday to patrol borders
and drills by some 150,000 Rus-
sian troops - almost the entirety
of its force in the western part of
the country - signaled strong de-

termination not to lose Ukraine to
the West.
Thursday's dramatic develop-
ments posed an immediate chal-
lenge to Ukraine's new authori-
ties as they named an interim
government for the country, whose
population is divided in loyal-
ties between Russia and the West.
Crimea, which was seized by Rus-
sian forces in the 18th century un-
der Catherine the Great, was once
the crown jewel in Russian and
then Soviet empires.
It only became part of Ukraine
in 1954 when Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev transferred jurisdic-
tion from Russia - a move that was
a mere formality until the 1991 So-
viet collapse meant Crimea landed
in an independent Ukraine.
In the capital, Kiev, the new
prime minister said Ukraine's fu-
tureliesinthe EuropeanUnionbut
with friendly relations with Russia.
Arseniy Yatsenyuk, named
Thursday in a boisterous parlia-
mentary session, now faces the
difficult task of restoring stability
in a country that is not only deeply
divided politically but on the verge
of financial collapse. The 39-year-
old served as economy minister,
foreign minister and parliamentary
speaker before Yanukovych took
office in 2010, and is widely viewed
as a technocratic reformer who en-
joys the support of the U.S.

GOODRICH, Mich.
Teacher involved
in fighting video to
remain employed
A Michigan elementary school
teacher is fighting efforts to fire
her for shooting celphone video
of a student who got stuck trying
to squeeze through the back of
his chair and allegedly replaying
the footage later for her class.
In a 54-second clip of the
November video taken in Nicole
McVey's fifth-grade classroom
at Oaktree Elementary School in
Goodrich, a woman can be heard
asking the trapped student, "How
did you get into that situation?"
When the woman tells the boy
that a maintenance crew is on its
way to help free him, a man can
be heard saying, "It's not really an
emergency in their book."
The video was shown to the
class on three occasions, said Pat-

boy's mother.

Teenage cancer
survivor wants to
research for a cure
First the teenager survived
a rare cancer. Then she wanted
to study it, spurring a study that
helped scientists find a weird
gene flaw that might play a role in
how the tumor strikes.
Age 18 is pretty young to be
listed as an author of a study in
the prestigious journal Science.
But the industrious high school
student's efforts are bringing
new attention to this mysterious
disease.

liver cancer that mostly hits ado-
lescents and young adults.

Democrats want to
make GOP split a
campaign issue
Gov. Jan Brewer's veto of
a bill allowing businesses to
refuse service to gays exposed a
fracture within the Republican
Party between social conserva-
tives and the GOP's pro-business
wing, a split that Democrats
hope to turn into a midterm elec-
tion campaign issue.
The Republican governor has
made job creation and business
expansion the centerpiece of
her administration, and she was
more than willing to disregard
the wishes of social conserva-
tives amid protests from major
corporations such as Ameri-
can Airlines and Apple Inc. As
a result, the GOP base was left
dispirited, and opponents of gay
marriage are struggling to find
their footing after significant

losses in the courts and state-
houses.

Oscar nomination
not shown at home
Directors of Egypt's first Oscar-
nominated film will be walking the
red carpet at the Oscars ceremony
next week in Los Angeles, but
most Egyptians have yet to see the
hard-hitting movie that chronicles
the country's unrest over the past
three years.
Far from being widely celebrat-
ed in Egypt, the film has not been
shown at Egyptian film festivals or
theaters after running into prob-
lems with censorship authorities.
The filmmakers say they have been
blocked because of their portrayal
of the country's military-backed
governments. They still hope to
get approval for wider distribution.
"It's a kind of politics disguised
in bureaucracy," said Karim Amer,
the film's producer, taking a line
that one of the film's central char-
acter uses to describe the gov-
ernment's counter-revolutionary
actions.Booms from the mountain

of the proposals. The regents
simply listened and voted in
approval.
"There are a lot of unanimous
votes on various items," Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
said in an interview with the
Daily. "But there is, from time
to time, discussion about items
before there is a vote during the
public session."
The regents meet informal-
ly, separately from the formal
monthly meetings, to discuss cer-
tain issues. These generally meet-
ings include two or three regents
and other University officials.
According to Frank LoMonte,
the executive director of the Stu-
dent Press Law Center, "there
has to be a voting majority of the

body, a quorum of the members,
present in order for it to be an
official meeting."
Fitzgerald said there are two
segments of public comments
during the meetings. The most
utilized public commentary seg-
ment is at the ends of meetings,
when a limited number of speak-
ers, who sign up in advance, can
address the regents on any issue
they want for five minutes.
The second, but not generally
used, public portion of the meet-
ings is at their beginning, when
any member of the public can
speak up about a proposal on a
meeting's agenda.
"There is always an oppor-
tunity for people to address the
regents on anything that is on
that meeting's agenda before
any of the voting takes place,"
Fitzgerald said.
He said this time slot is always
reserved, but rarely used.
LoMonte said the rarity of
these early meeting dialogues
is an example of the minimal
engagement between the public
and the regents.
"The places where people tend
to complain are the places where
the official meetings don't seem
very substantive," LoMonte said.
The meeting agendas, with
detailed proposal descriptions,
are posted online the Monday
prior to every monthly Thursday

meeting. The minutes of every
meeting are posted online for
public review afterward.
"The process that the board
operates under is well-estab-
lished and well-grounded in the
state law," Fitzgerald said. "This'
has been an effective way to work
and we believe it is compliant
with the Open Meetings Act."
In January's special regents
meeting, during which the board
named University President-
elect Mark Schlissel, new con-
cerns about the regents' secrecy
were in regard to the presidential
search process.
The formal meeting, when
regents voted on the approval of
the new president, was held open
to the public. A 1999 Michigan
Supreme Court decision allows
the University - and all Michi-
gan public universities - to con-
duct presidential searches in
private.
A significant reason for keep-
ing the search process private
was that candidates do not want
to jeopardize their job when
the search is open, according to
Regent Andrea Fischer Newman
(R).
"Your pool is much broader
and much bigger if you can keep
the search process private,"
Newman said in a January inter-
view.

very turbulent period.
"Basically the term I like to
use was Honduras was sur-
rounded by trouble," he said,
referencing the conflicts in El
Salvador and the Sandinista
regime in Nicaragua. "If Wash-
ington is divided about what to
do, it really makes your job that
much harder."
Negroponte also discussed
negotiations for the creation of
the North America Free Trade
Agreement, which began under
President George H.W. Bush
and were successfully conclud-
ed under President Bill Clinton
in August 1993.
As the discussion concluded,
students at the back of the audi-
torium invited other attendees
to join the vigil to berate his
alleged crimes.
According to the protesters,
Negroponte arranged fund-
ing for militias and "brutal
regimes" in Central America,
participation in the creation of
NAFTA that led thousands of
Mexicans to poverty and used
of death squads in Iraq.
The vigil was held outside
the Annenberg Auditorium
while Negroponte and the other
guests stood a few feet away at
the discussion's conclusion.
Rackham student Geoff
Hughes, who led the vigil, said
Negroponte was trying to pro-
tect his reputation, reworking
his interpretation of history
during the discussion.
"If you look at his statements
now he is either criminally
negligent or he has basically
changed his story in a very
kind of cynical way," Hughes
said.
The demonstrators formed
a circle and held papers with
attacks aimed toward Negro-
ponte. The group chanted
"Death squads aren't democ-
racy," and "War criminals are
not welcome on campus." The

chants continued as Negro-
ponte walked up the stairs and
the group followed him. Dem-
onstrators read names of dead
in Iraq and those who perished
in the El Mozote massacre in El
Slavador.
"I wanted to shift the focus
of the event on the victims and I
think we were able to do that to
some degree," Hughes said.
Kevin Young, an academic
affiliate who wrote a Viewpoint
in The Michigan Daily criticiz-
ing the University's invitation
of Negroponte, said people may
have been fooled by Thursday's
event if they had come into it
without any previous familiar-
ity with the subject.
"The thing that really struck
me was just how cordial and
friendly and congenial it was,"
he said. "We didn't really
hear anything about the on-
the-ground consequences of
the policies over which John
Negroponte presided. All the
questions tended to focus on the
kind of instrumental rationality
behind policy."
"We feel that in cases where
officials have committed verifi-
able war crime on a large scale,
as Mr. Negroponte has done,
that they shouldn't be invited
to any respectable academic
forum," he said.
Rackham student Seema
Singh was one of the two stu-
dents who asked questions
submitted by the crowd. Singh
thought that this was a good
opportunity to learn and was
happy that Negroponte offered
his perspective and experi-
ences.
She added that the event
allowed for freedom of opinion.
She noted that there were no
distinctions made with regard
to the type of question, and that
those chosen were mostly rep-
resentative of the rest.

communications and outreach
at the Public Policy School,

donors, as all public events for

"Melissa's genius is in recog-
nizing that teaching and learn-
ing don't happen if curiosity isn't
present," said Linda Kendall
Knox, the Duderstadt Center's
learning design librarian, who
has worked with Gross since
her first foray into using anima-
tion as a teaching tool in 1995.
"She just can't help but share her
curiosity about the world with
her students."
Gross also teaches "Human
Musculoskeletal Anatomy," a
course that has strict guide-
lines about what must be cov-
ered by the end of the semester.
But she still pulls from differ-
ent disciplines to teach. An
extra credit project asks stu-
dents to visit the University of
Michigan Museum of Art to
critique anatomical drawings
from the 18th century.
"She understood that you can
use a lot of different lenses to
look at the same problem," Kir-
shner said. "I think that's part of
what was so stimulating about
teaching with her, is that abil-
ity to kind of make connections
across fields."

people with disabilities.
The opposing "Better Transit
Now" campaign, which supports
the expansion of and investment
in Ann Arbor transit, claims the
city is acting without considering
other transportation options that
would better meet the needs of
residents.
Lou Glorie, an Ann Arbor resi-
dent, said the "Better Transit
Now" campaign is agroup of con-
cerned residents who see flaws
in the five-year AATA plan. The
two main issues they cite are the
unfair distribution of taxation
on Ann Arbor residents while
residents of surrounding town-
ships don't contribute equally but
benefit, and concerns about the
effectiveness of the pulse model
of transit for Ann Arbor.

"I think that since we pay for
this system, we should be paying
for a system that works for us,
right?" Glorie said. "So I would
prefer to see a modification, not
a complete abandonment of the
hub system, there is some logic to
it, but there are certain nonsen-
sical gaps in our service that are
caused by a foolish consistency
in adhering to the hub system
almost religiously."
"I think of them as 'Better
Transit Never,"' Warpehoski, a
supporter of the plan, said. "The
way to have better transit is to
have more buses, more places,
more often. The only way we
can get better transit is to fund
it, and this is the plan to fund
it."
In March 2013, AATA found
the current model of transporta-
tion services, a hub-and-spoke
system, is best suited to meet
the needs of Ann Arbor and sur-

rounding residents.
The Urban Core Campaign, an
advocacy organization working
on transit issues, concluded that
this type of transit system works
best for U.S. cities with fewer
than 500,000 residents.
"It distributes trips efficiently.
It makes it possible for a person
to get from nearly anywhere in
Ann Arbor to anywhere else in
Ann Arbor with a travel time of
no more than 45 minutes," the
report stated.
Referencing a 2007 study con-
ducted by Parsons Brinckerhoff
for the AATA, staff and repre-
sentatives determined the hub
and spoke model was best suited
for Ann Arbor since roads are
not set up in a grid-structure - a
requirement for alternative sys-
tems.
But with two months until a
vote, the debate will likely con-
tinue.

State of Michigan
seeks contaminant
to quell blooms in
Lake Erie
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
(AP) - Sharp cutbacks in phos-
phorus runoff into Lake Erie are
needed to counter a worsening
problem of algae blooms that
degrade water quality, harm fish
and chase away tourists, a U.S.-
Canadian agency said ina report
to both governments Thursday.
The International Joint Com-
mission, which recommends
policies dealing with the Great
Lakes and other border water-
ways, recommended targets for
lowering daily amounts of phos-
phorus flowing into the ailing
Erie. It's the smallest of the five
lakes yet has the most abundant
fish population and supports a
billion-dollar angling and boat-
ingindustry.
The commission said the
level must drop by 46 percent
to shrink by half a "dead zone"
where algae saps so much oxy-
gen that fish can't survive. It
called for a 39 percent decrease
on the western side of the lake
where algae blooms have been
particularly widespread.
Phosphorus, a nutrient that
feeds algae, was among pollut-
ants that had so degraded Lake
Erie by the 1970s that some de-
clared it dead. The problem im-
proved significantly with laws
requiring steep reductions
in phosphorus releases from
wastewater treatment plants
and factories. But it returned in
the late 1990s and has steadily
worsened. A bloom in summer
of 2011 was the largest on re-
cord, coating a 1,930-square-
mile surface area with green-
ish slime.
The algae ispoisonous enough
to kill animals and make people
sick. An Ohio township last year
ordered residents not to drink
tap water for two days because
of algae pollution, while Toledo
and other cities have tested and
treated their supplies. When
the algae dies, foul rotting mats
wash onto beaches or sink to the
bottom, robbingthe water - and
fish - of oxygen.
The report largely blames the
algae's resurgence on manure
and chemical fertilizer from
farms, along with urban sourc-

es such as lawn fertilizers, pet
droppings, leaky septic tanks
and storm water drains. It pro-
poses designating the lake as an
impaired waterway under the
federal Clean Water Act to force
phosphorus limits.
"It's time for governments at
all levels to put the lake on a diet
by setting targets and achieving
real reductions," said Lana Pol-
lack, chairwoman of the com-
mission's U.S. section.
The reduction targets should
be met by 2022, the report said.
Overall levels have not risen
since the mid-1990s, according
tothe reportbased on twoyears
of study by more than 60 scien-
tists with universities, private
firms and government agencies.
But a type called dissolved re-
active phosphorus, or DRP, has
more than doubled - and it's the
variety "most easily used by the
algae for growth," said Don Sca-
via, director of the University of
Michigan's Graham Sustainabil-
ity Institute.
D P chemical fertilizers
are popular for producing corn
used as animal feed on large
industrial farms, Scavia said.
Manure also can undergo a
process that generates DRP.
In the past couple of decades,
farmers increasingly have ap-
plied both in fall and winter,
whenthe material sometimes
has remained atop frozen
ground or snow instead of
soaking in. Farmers also have
done less tilling.
Such changes prevented fer-
tilizers from being worked into
the soil, making them more apt
to wash into streams and even-
tually the lake during the spring
melt, Scavia said. As the climate
has warmed, more intense rain-
storms have boosted phospho-
rus flushing.
The report urges states in the
Lake Erie watershed, includ-
ing Michigan, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Indiana - as
well as the Canadian province of
Ontario - to ban spreading farm'
fertilizers on frozen or snow-
covered ground.
Farm groups acknowledge
a role in the problem but favor
voluntary best- management,
practices to cut down on run-
off, such as making sure fertil-
izer comes in contact with the
soil, said Larry Antosch, envi-
ronmental policy director with
the Ohio Farm Bureau. Regula-
tions don't allow enough flex-
ibility, he said.

Updating an outdated law
Michigan must include the LGBTQ community in the ELCRA
recent Gallup poll revealed glaring discrepancies between
public perception and the realities of anti-discrimination
laws in the state of Michigan. While nine out of 10 people
mistakenly believe protections exist for members of the LGBTQ
community, current laws are disgracefully outdated and do not
encompass guarantees for LGBTQ citizens. The Elliot-Larsen Civil
Rights Act - Michigan's anti-discrimination law - provides protection
to individuals on the basis of numerous categories. Yet, individuals
who identify as - or are even suspected of being - homosexual,
transgendered or bisexual continue to face the unjust possibility of
being denied employment, housing or access to public accommodations.
To ensure the equality and fundamental rights of all members of the
state, Michigan needs to amend the ELCRA to be more inclusive.

The role of Detroit's fellowship programs

emphasizing HEXANNE
opportunities HERMANN
in Detroit in
particular.
It's a script Snyder has repeated
frequently since assuming office
- why be just another yuppie in
Chicago when you can make a real
difference in Detroit?
Further, Snyder contends that
many recent graduates and young
professionals simply aren't aware
of the opportunities available to
them here.
And he's right.
There are numerous unique
opportunities in Detroit meant
to attract young professionals
seriously considering relocating to
the Motor City for the first time or
those who might otherwise depart
for greener pastures.
Consider, for example,
Challenge Detroit, a "leadership
and professional development"
fellowship that pairs 30
participants from across the
country with Detroit-based
employers in every industry and
sector. Fellows become immersed
in Detroit's social scene, volunteer
opportunities, and leadership and
networking events. Challenge
Detroit is accepting applications
through March 9, and is an excellent
prospect for graduating students
looking to jumpstart a career while
making a difference in the city.
The program is only one of
several fellowships providing
incentives for young professionals
to broadly impact Detroit.
The Detroit Revitalization

Fellows Program similarly matches
development professionals with
key economic and community
development agencies across
the city. The D:hive Residency
Program is also specifically tailored
to attract recent graduates with
limited professional experience to
Detroit.
If nothing else, these programs
contribute to and accelerate the
promising trend in Detroit's urban
core that's currently witnessing a
much-needed talent infusion.
According to "7.2 SQ MI: A
Report on Greater Downtown
Detroit," in 2011 nearly 1,000
young professionals - defined
as 25- to 34-year-olds with
bachelor's degrees - were selected
for three-month to two-year
fellowships and internships in
Detroit through programs like
Challenge Detroit, the D:hive
residency, Teach for America
and the Detroit Revitalization
Fellows. Additionally, the
report - commissioned by the
Hudson-Webber Foundation
and other partners a year ago
- claims that over 2,600 young
professionals reside in the 7.2-
mile area comprising Detroit's
Greater Downtown, including
the Central Business District and

that these positive developments
are no substitute for a cohesive
agenda that strengthens Detroit
neighborhoods and simultaneously
builds capacity outside the
immediate downtown-area
to complement urban core
revitalization.
As Thomas Sugrue, author of
"The Origins of the Urban Crisis:
Race and Inequality in Postwar
Detroit" - to many, the book on
Detroit - recently talked with the
Detroit Free Press about the city's
future.
"The future of a city, if it's going
to be successful, the future of
Detroit is going to be improving the
everyday quality of life for residents
who are living a long way from
downtown and a long way from
Midtown, who probably aren't ever
going to spend much time listening
to techno or sipping lattes,"
Sugrue said.
But with the right energy and
a commitment to social justice,
young professionals can certainly
make meaningful progress
benefitting everyone in the city.
For example, 24 of 27 fellows from
Challenge Detroit's inaugural
cohort remained in Detroit.
And of all the fellowship
programs mentioned above -

As a result of Michigan's "at-will" law,
employers don't need to provide a justification
for firing an employee. Similarly, the absence
of protections under the ELCRA allows
LGBTQ members to be denied access to
restaurants and hotels. Michigan's lack of
protections demonstrates that the state's
legislation is archaic compared to the
advancements in many parts of the country.
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced
in February that the Obama administration's
decision to extend equal rights to legally
married same-sex couples in federal matters.
Likewise, discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation is outlawed in 21 states and the
District of Columbia, with 17 states instituting
protections on the basis of gender identity.
Whilea sizable portion of the United States
is proactive inits efforts to guarantee equality,
Michigan currently possesses a subpar set
of protections. Select municipalities in the
state - all of which are located in the lower
peninsula of Michigan - enforce LGBTQ
protections for citizens at the local level.
However, these laws vary greatly between
cities on both the type of discrimination and
the identities they protect. Citizens shouldn't
need to worry about whether their rights will
be encroached upon or denied if they leave

a particular city and travel elsewhere in the
state. Unified and comprehensive legislation
is needed in order to ensure the rights of all
Michigan citizens.
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder needs to
stop relying on local governments to handle
these issues and should instead push state
legislators to create a comprehensive plan.
Earlier this year, Snyder was reported
to have had "a number of other things ...
as priorities" when he was questioned
about his lack of a stance on issues such as
LGBTQ employment discrimination and gay
marriage. Michigan can't continue to allow a
portion of its citizens to suffer under unfair
legislation. The state should follow in the
steps of California and Massachusetts, which
guarantee LGBTQ members equal access to
housing, employment, government services,
marriage and adoption rights.
At a time when the rest of the country is
moving forward and growing more open to
equal rights for LGBTQ members of society,
Michigan is severely lagging behind. Granting
full equality protection to LGBTQ citizens
is an initiative a majority of voters approve
of. Updating the ELCRA will help Michigan
become more inclusive and propel the state into
a leadership role in the battle for equal rights.

I thought I had more time

As the cleanup in Sochi continues
this week, the impending disaster
that had been so frequently dis-
cussed before the event has been
averted. There wasn't a terrorist
attack, the facilities were finished,
and, by and large, everything ran
smoothly - so much smoother than
we wanted.
In the lead-up to the Winter
Games in Sochi, the negative press
surrounding the games was stag-
gering. Everything ranging from
Russian legislation against homo-
sexuality, to the mismanagement
of funds and allegations of cor-
ruption. Even the poor stray dogs
of Sochi made headlines, with the
discovery of a Russian plan to elimi-
nate the feral population before the
arrival of hundreds of thousands of
tourists, many with a penchant for
petting animals on the streets with-
out a second thought to the pos-
sible health risks the animals carry.
Following the coverage closely, I
started to believe that we wanted
something bad to happen.
To our delight, we whetted our
palate with proof of the imminent
disaster as the press arrived in
Sochi. Photos and comments began
pouring out from the press about
the "conditions" in Sochi. "Sochi
Disaster" started trending on Twit-
ter. Looking closer at many of the
"issues," things like not being able
to flush toilet paper or the tap water
being undrinkable aren't really
characteristics of a lack of prepa-
ration or any form of disaster, but
conditions that exist in most devel-

oping nations. It's frankly embar-
rassingthatthese minor peccadillos
captured the imagination of the
Western public. A great deal of the
world's population lives in condi-
tions similar to these. I suppose
Russia should offer a heartfelt apol-
ogy to the journalists, because the
hotels in Sochi weren't, in fact, the
Hilton in London or the Marriott in
New York City. I'm sorry that Russia
wasn't as nice as Vancouver in 2010
or Turin before that. But things are
looking up! South Korea is next and
perhaps they are developed enough
for the press.
But unlike similar or worse condi-
tions that were rampant at the 2010
World Cup in South Africa (which
caused an influx of more than
40,000 prostitutes in the country),
Russia is somehow held responsible
for being different. Even as the ice
has all but melted from the Cold
War, the West still takes an adver-
sarial approach to Russia. Putin has,
without a doubt, tyrannical tenden-
cies and his regime should be open
to criticism, but belittling Sochi for
some non-functional toilets or bro-
ken curtains is nothing but Western
elitism. We live in a world with lin-
gering Cold War prejudices, a world
in which the average American still
views the average Russian as their
backwards rival.
Yet as the American media
throws allegations of corruption
on Russian officials in Sochi, they
seemed to have conveniently forgot-
ten the allegations of bribery that
accompanied the Winter Games in

Salt Lake City in 2002. So severe
were those offenses that several
members of the Olympic Interna-
tional Committee, the governing
body of the Olympics, were forced
to resign. Good thing Mitt Romney
was there save the day.
We are also quick to forget our
own sordid history with homo-
sexuality. Michigan and 16 other
states still have a law banning sod-
omy. It took a Supreme Court case
in 2003 to overturn these laws.
While no longer enforceable, these
laws remain on the books in these
states, and little effort is being made
to change or amend them. The laws
that caused such protest in Russia
are arguably less severe than the
law Michigan lawmakers crafted.
There's an old line of jokes that
go something like "In Russia, car
drives you!" focusing on the overall
backwardness of the nation. Inter-
estingly, a minor amendment could
make this remark applicable for the
United States. "In the United States,
media drives you!" We listen to the
media and it drives our perception
on what will or should happen. The
Western media's complaints are
shameful and show how spoiled
and disconnected we really are. The
disaster the media wanted, that it
marketed so fiercely to the public,
didn't happen. I guess there's some
truth in one of these jokes. Although
driverless cars may be right around
the corner.

line at Skeep's. I won't be relaxing at home,
binge-watching "House of Cards" on Netflix.
I won't celebrate the end of midterms with
friends. Instead, I will celebrate the life of my
grandmother. I will go home Friday morning,
I will sit with my family in an impersonal room
in the intensive care unit of St. John's Hospital
in Warren, Mich., and I will watch one of the
most important people in my life take her last
breath as she is taken off of life support.
I don't write this so you pity me. I write
this for my own sense of closure.
I last spoke to my grandmother on
Valentine's Day, when I called to see if she had
any plans with friends, or with my parents, or
my uncle, because I worried about her being
alone. She didn't. She said she mightvisit with
my papa, in the cemetery where he's laid for
the past four years. I felt guilty, I remember. I
had plans with my living, breathing boyfriend
that night. I have yet to visit papa at his grave.
She asked me about all the developments in
my life, which I was all too excited to share.
I rambled on about my work at the Daily,
and my internship for the coming summer
and all of the amazing, coming-of-age
milestones that were consuming my life. Out
of obligation, Iasked her what was new in her
life. Nothing much, she said.
Even now as I try so hard to remember
every last word she said to me, I can't. I told
her I couldn't wait to see her in two weeks,
when I would be home for spring break. That
didn't seem so long away at the time.
My grandma, my nana, was stubborn.
She was proud, and she had strong beliefs
and she was good and giving. There were
many moments when we didn't get along,
but there were so many more when we did.
I loved listening to stories about her life
growing up, and about her family and papa,
and everything else. My biggest regret, the

irony of which is not lost on me as I attempt
to establish myself as a journalist, is that I did
not ask her more questions.
How many nights did I spend scrolling
through my Twitter feed or locked in
my room, as she sat in my living room,
anticipating conversation and company? How
did I not realize that she was so much more
interesting than whatever fashion blog I was
reading, that her nights were so much more
precious than mine, so much more finite?
I had been meaning to sit her down to
make a family tree, before all of the faces and
names that had once defined her life were
replaced with the absence of mind that so
often accompanies old age. I thought I had
more time.
My only solace is knowing that the last
conversation my parents had with her was
a happy one. My mother bought her a ticket
to Florida, where we are traveling for Spring
Break, scheduled to leave this Sunday. They
asked if they should get insurance for her
plane ticket. She said no.
This weekend, I don't want to go home. I
don't want to go to the hospital, I don't want
to see the rest of my family, I don't want to sift
through Nana's belongings and I don't want to
face my friends and pretend everything is ok.
I do want Nana pestering me again to peel
the potatoes at Thanksgiving, even though
the turkey won't be done cooking for another
hour. I do want to miss 15 minutes of family
movie night to make her coffee, and I want
to be sent back to the kitchen to put the right
amount of cream into the steaming cup. I
want to explain to her, again, the difference
between the Internet in general and
Facebook specifically, and I want to call her
on Valentine's Day every year for the next 20.
I don't want to say goodbye.

"Digital Witness," St. Vincent
establishes itself as an album
open to veteran fans along with
St. Vincent virgins. Despite the
controlled chaos in the erratic
"Bring Me Your Loves," Clark's
voice is sweet and welcoming,
creating what could be consid-
ered avant-garde for dummies.
It's easy enough to bob your
head and sing along yet some-
thing always seems a bit off or
too weird, but in the best way.
Many artists, once they are
categorized as Indie, have
either lost their artistic focus
or tried so hard that their
efforts are overshadowed by a
poor product. St. Vincent, how-
ever, is growing in her artistic
cred, alternating between the
bizarre and the beautiful, the
unruly and the controlled - all
in a single song. The up-tempo,
ultra-catchy "Birth In Reverse"
begins with the line "Oh what
an ordinary day / Take out the
garbage, masturbate." No detail
is spared, each lyric and brass
introduction being finely tuned
and executed.
At this point, Clark's musi-

cal confidence is apparent.
After four albums (this doesn't
include her collaborative
record with David Byrne), her
sound is now identifiably St.
Vincent and it's near perfect; an
angelic voice paired with unex-
pected musicality prompt a fine
contradiction.
While it may be a declaration
that could have been confirmed
years ago, St. Vincent - while
beginning to navigate the
mainstream scene more than
she once was - has transcend-
ed the idea of the typical indie
rocker. Instead of churning out
lo-fi hits, mixing synths and
distorted samples - a sound
that has earned a place in its
own right - she creates, mix-
ing genres, experimenting with
instrumentation, challenging
herself lyrically. Clark's music
is much bigger than the indie
scope.
While St. Vincent takes off
into well-known territory, it's
just as fresh and exciting as
we've come to expect from the
artist, who does what she does
best - make art.

Looking at myself as far more

By COSMO PAPPAS
For the Daily
Spin a globe, close your eyes
and let your finger land where
it will. Pack up, say goodbye,
since your one-way ticket is for
tomorrow. You have to leave
your life to lead your life, as
they say.
This is how the logic of col-
lege admissions and career pur-
suit - in a phrase, achievement
and mobility - unfolds today.
Usually, however, it's better at
concealing its objectives.
If the reader will indulge me
a bit, I'd like to quote German-
Jewish philosopher Theodor
Adorno for explanation. "It is
part of the mechanism of dom-
ination," he says in Minima
Moralia, "to forbid recognition
of the suffering it produces." It
never struck me until recently
that my Fulbright fantasies,
furnished with every detail
you'd expect - Parisian cafes,
Neoclassical columns and a
heaping, unflattering share of
self-importance - are a farce.
Now, I'm not setting out to
deride achievement and pres-
tige in any form or context.
Aspiration and rigor are the
ingredients of good work, in my
opinion. I can't help but think,

Postseason berth on the line

'M' faces another
ranked opponent

The Michigan hockey team

"We can't afford to lose any
more games and I think every-
one in that locker room knows
that," said senior forward Derek
DeBlois. "We're fighting for a
playoff spot every day."
Added Michigan coach Red
Berenson: "Everyone is getting
better and we may not have got-
ten better as a team. A lot of our
individuals have continued to
improve but has our whole team
gottenbetter? I don't think so."
Michigan (7-6-1, 15-10-3)
sits eight points behind second-
place Wisconsin and a bye in the
first round of the Big Ten Tour-
nament, and just three points
ahead of the fourth-place Buck-
eyes.
A loss would not only math-
ematically eliminate the Wol-
verines from finishing in the top
two of the conference, but would
also put them on the bubble of a
berth in the NCAA Tournament.
Standing in their way will be

State's offense, which sits No.
7 in the nation. Together, Ryan
Dzingel and Tanner Fritz have
combined for 32 points this sea-
son on a team that averages 3.39
goals per game.
So to help his team shut them
down, Berenson distributed
an article on the importance of
defense. It'sbeengoingon longer
than any senior can remember,
and no one knows who wrote
it, but it preaches that defense
doesn't require a special skillset
so much as a special mindset.
"Defense is all heart and all
will," said senior forward Luke
Moffatt. "Offense might not
come every day, but with defense
you can show up every day."
Unfortunately, Michigan will
be missing one of its hardest
workers in senior defenseman

Mac Bennett. The captain will
miss the weekend after he suf-
fered an "upper-body injury" in
the second game of last week-
end's series against Penn State.
Questions also surround
the goaltending position, after
freshman netminder Zach
Nagelvoort allowed five goals
- albeit with a porous defense
in front of him - on Friday
night. Sophomore goaltender
Steve Racine held the Nittany
Lions to two goals, which makes
the decision for the weekend
increasingly harder.
Nearly one year ago against
the Buckeyes, Berenson started
Racine in the hope of sparking
his offense. The result was an
8-1-1 record in the final10 games.
The loss puts more pressure
on forwards to shut down
Ohio State's potent offensive

duo. Berenson will have to
excel at making line changes
this weekend to match his top
line with the Buckeyes' on a
consistent basis.
But Michigan's forwards also
proved they are capable after
holding Penn State to 20 shots
last weekend.
"The fact is that we need
to play better and find a way
to generate more wins on a
consistent basis," Berenson said.
"We have to play a lot better than
we have in recent games. It's
that simple. If we do well, then
we'll have a chance of having
a good Big Ten Tournament
and then being an option in the
NCAA. If we don't win, then we
don't make the tournament and
won't deserve it.
"We have to start playing
better, starting this Friday."

The road
to the title
seemed easy after Michigan
(12-3 Big Ten, 20-7 overall) ran
past Michigan State at home
on Sunday. After that win, the
Wolverines had four games left
against Purdue, Minnesota,
Illinois and Indiana - all
teams in the bottom half of the
conference - and it seemed they
could coast to the conference
title.
After the win over the
Spartans, Michigan coach John
Beilein stressed that there was
still a lot of basketball left to
play, and that the next four
games would be as challenging
as any. But after taking care
of Michigan State - widely
predicted to win the Big Ten at
the beginning of the season -
many thought that the next four
games would be soft obstacles
in the way of the Wolverines
collecting a banner.
But as Robinson's shot sat
on top of the rim for a moment
at Mackey Arena, it looked as
though Michigan had blown its
chances of controlling its own
fate against a Boilermaker team
with just five conference wins.
But as the clock hit zero, the ball
fell through and Michigan was
one step closer to its goal.

On Saturday, Minnesota
will attempt to do what Purdue
couldn't - upset the Wolverines
and stymie their chances of
owning the conference title by
themselves. The Gophers (7-9,
18-11) nearly

An unlikely hero, sophomore
guard Zak Irvin, saved the team

In the first matchup between

Minnesota is led by guards
Andre Hollins and DeAndre
Mathieu, who have averaged
14.8 and 12.9 points per game
this season, respectively.
Mathieu, a 5-foot-9 guard,
shoots better than 50 percent
from the field and is one of just
two players who has started
every game this season for the
Gophers. But the problem for
Minnesota is that its scoring
defense, the ninth-best in the
conference, gives up 67.9 points
on average.
Michigan's game against
Purdue proved that in the Big
Ten, records can be thrown
away once the game starts. Any
night can belong to any team.
But on Saturday, playing on its
home court, it's hard to imagine
that Michigan doesn't walk
away a winner, one game closer
to a conference title.

While the No. 16 Michigan
men's basketball team (12-3 Big
Ten, 20-7 overall) sits in the driv-
er's seat ofthe Big Ten, right in the
middle of the pack is Minnesota
(7-9, 18-11). Coming off of a win
against No. 20 Iowa, the Golden
Gophers stand within striking
distance of an NCAA Tourna-
ment bid. Behind the bench of
the bubble team is first-year head
coach Richard Pitino.
The
Daily sat
down with
Pitino at E
Big Ten LINES
Media Day
in Octo-
ber to talk
about his father - Louisville
coach Rick Pitino - almost com-
ing to Michigan, the wintry con-
ditions of Minnesota and why he
left his father's coaching staff to
venture out on his own.
The Michigan Daily: It's
your first year at Minnesota.
Coming from Florida Interna-
tional, have you experienced the
coldness of Minnesota as of yet?
Richard Pitino: Not yet. But
I went to high school in Boston,
went to college in Rhode Island,
so I'm kind of used to that cold
winter weather. What's great for
me, honestly, the weather's phe-
nomenal and it starts to get colder
whenthe season starts.Andthat's
when I'm like a zombie walking
around during the season so I
don't pay much attention to that.
TMD: Back in the early
2000's, your father (Rick Pitino)
almost took the job at Michigan.
Do you remember that at all?
RP: I was in college, and I
remember it like it was yesterday.
I was on springbreak inthe Baha-
mas and my dad told me he was
taking Michigan. And I remem-
ber I was at a craps table and I
was with my friends, and all of a
sudden I look up and see 'hey it's
your dad' and it's got a Cardinal
bird underneath and I go 'what

the heck is that?' That's how I
learned that we were moving to
Louisville and not Michigan. It
was an amazing story.
TMD: Were you happy with
that decision? What was really
your opinion at the time?
RP: I was shocked, just
because we've grown up at the
University of Kentucky and I
didn't want anythingto be taken
away from his success. I didn't
want anyone to feel as if, you
know, what he did there in the
eight years may be a little differ-
ent now that he's the head coach
at Louisville. So at first, I waa
a little nervous about it, but it's
turned out to be a great decision.
He loves it there, certainly.
TMD: Michigan played Lou-
isville in the NCAA Champion-
ship game last year. And you're
in the Big Ten now, did your
father give you any advice about
Michigan up to this point?
RP: No. We haven't even
talked about Michigan. That
feels like it's years away, the
Michigan game. What I'm wor-
ried about more than anything
is practice, getting these guys
better.
TMD: Was it better for you
to leave Louisville when you did
to go to Florida and learn from
Billy Donovan?
RP: I think the best part,
more than anything, was to go
and work for another Hall of
Famer. That's an opportunity
that impacted my life great-
ly. Everyone says 'Oh, you're
Rick Pitino's son.' If you actu-
ally watch the way that we play
and the way that we do a lot of
things, you'll see alot of Univer-
sity of Florida and Billy Dono-
van influence in the way that we
do things. I use both of them a
lot. (I) call them often. I talked
to Billy last night on the phone
just about a couple recruiting
things. Maybe you have some
advice on how to approach this
situation. Or my dad may have
advice. They're so different, but
very similar ... it's helpful for
me.
