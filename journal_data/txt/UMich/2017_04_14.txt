Denise A. Spellberg, a professor 

of history at The University of 
Texas at Austin, headlined the 
annual Interdisciplinary Islamic 
Studies Seminar Symposium on 
Thursday where she discussed 
Thomas Jefferson’s connection 
with Islam. 

Spellberg opened the address 

to an audience of 20 faculty and 
graduate students in the Michigan 
League 
by 
explaining 
that 

Jefferson knew more about Islam 
than most of his contemporaries. 
She said he went out of his way 
to study the faith and meet its 
practitioners.

“As a historian of the American 

founders and their interest in 
Islam and Muslims, and as one 
who teaches Islamic studies, I 
think the precedence of Thomas 
Jefferson 
remains 
important, 

because 
he 
once 
imagined 

Muslims here in the U.S.,” she 
said.

She went on to say the few 

scholarly books that consider 
Jefferson’s involvement in the 
Muslim 
world 
emphasize 
a 

“dominant negative paradigm.” 
She said such books emphasize 
“Muslim” and “American” are 
terms most often placed in binary 
opposition as the eternal “them” 
and “us.”

Spellberg’s work focuses on 

challenging such a dichotomy 
and is documented in her book 
“Thomas 
Jefferson’s 
Qur’an: 

Islam and the Founders.”

At the address, she discussed 

how the ideas of Islam influenced 
the 
United 
States’ 
founders 

and subsequently transformed 
“imagined” Muslims — a group 
considered outsiders in the 18th 
century — into exemplars of the 
United States’ ideals of religious 
pluralism and civil rights.

“Thomas 
Jefferson 
in 

particular was a visionary — a 
man who planned for a nation 
that included Muslims as future 

citizens, 
despite 
sometimes 

simultaneously 
expressing 

negative views of Islam,” she 
said. “The ideal of their future 
presence and shared American 
spaces — this imagined future, 
while notional — contains key 
elements of what today might be 
considered an aspect of American 
exceptionalism.”

Such 
exceptionalism, 
she 

explained, refers to the precedent 
that anyone of any religion might 

reside in the United States with 
citizenship 
and 
equal 
rights 

— ideals that she believes are 
attacked under President Donald 
Trump’s administration.

In light of this statement, the 

symposium in general focused 
on the effect of the Trump 
administration on Islamic studies 
and was inspired by solidarity 
movements such as Black Lives 
Matter, the response to the 

Building on the strength 

and national and international 
recognition of the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Mobility 

Transformation 
Center 
and 

Mcity, the entirity of automated 
vehicle testing has officially 
been branded Mcity.

The Mobility Transformation 

Center launched in 2013 as 
a public-private partnership 
between 
government 
and 

industry to expand research 
on driverless cars. The MTC 
introduced Mcity in July 2015, 
as the world’s first testing 
ground for advanced mobility 
vehicles and technology.

Mcity 
quickly 
gained 

worldwide name recognition, 
which motivated the University 
to consider changing the name 
of the entire center. In an 
email interview, Susan Carney, 
the director of marketing and 
communications 
for 
Mcity, 

highlighted the importance of 
capitalizing on this growing 
recognition.

“We wanted to build on 

that strength,” Carney wrote.

As 
part 
of 
the 
closing 

ceremonies for the SHARE 
vigil, a 24-hour event hosted 
by the Students for Holocaust 
Awareness, Remembrance and 
Education, students read names 
of people who died during the 
Holocaust and heard from five 
Holocaust survivors.

The survivors attended the 

closing ceremonies Thursday 
night at University of Michigan 
Hillel to tell their stories, talk 
to students and share music 
they sang during the Holocaust. 
SHARE hosted this ceremony, 
following the reading of names 
out of a book in front of the 
Espresso 
Royale 
on 
South 

University Avenue, as one of its 
annual events.

The students who attended 

the event noted how valuable 
it is to hear survivors’ stories, 
which is the motivation for 
many of the events SHARE 
plans. For LSA sophomore Lilah 
Kalfus, member of the SHARE 

board, 
this 
sentiment 
rang 

especially true, as both of her 
grandparents were Holocaust 
survivors. 

“We’re 
one 
of 
the 
last 

generations to be able to talk 
to survivors, so we are just 
trying to provide as many 
opportunities to do that, like 
my kids won’t be able to talk to 
a Holocaust survivor,” Kalfus 
said. 

LSA sophomore Kyla Klein, 

a member of Hillel, echoed 
this 
sentiment, 
emphasizing 

how important these types of 
conversations are in the current 
political climate.

“My whole life I’ve been very 

interested in the Holocaust 
and just how it happened 
exactly,” Klein said. “I think 
it’s really cool to gain this 
type of perspective; especially 
with what’s happening in the 
world right now, it’s important 
to 
recognize 
systematic 

oppression and genocide and 
the Holocaust.”

The community, making up less than one percent of the University, reflect on inclusion 

Some 
Native 
American 

students are elated by a recent 
exhibit 
that 
aims 
to 
bring 

awareness to the role Native 
Americans had in the founding 
of the University of Michigan 
but overall there is an underlying 
concern about the ways the 
University 
is 
representing 

Native Americans during its 
bicentennial celebrations. 

The 
“Native 
Americans: 

Michigan’s Foundation” exhibit, 
which is one of seven pop-
up 
art 
installations 
named 

“Stumbling 
Blocks” 
seeking 

to bring awareness to some of 
the difficult moments of the 
University’s history, has led 
Native American students to 
point to some of the issues 
with representing the Native 
American identity on campus.

On Ingalls Mall, one of these 

“Stumbling 
Block” 
exhibits, 

a raised plaque, highlights a 
sizably 
smaller, 
permanent 

plaque that already exists in the 

ground nearby to commemorate 
a gift of land from three 
Native American tribes to the 
University in 1817.

For Native American student 

Kaitlin Gant, an LSA senior, 
one of her biggest concerns was 
the lack of dedication given to 
other equally significant effects 
Native Americans have had on 
the history of the University.

“While I think it made a 

profound impact and drew more 
attention to the importance of 
Native American contributions 
to the campus, a sign is where the 

attention stopped,” Gant said.

Gant discussed the how the 

plaque came about as a result 
of Native American student 
activism on campus and protests 
led by Native students in the 
early 2000s advocating for the 
removal and University support 
of a student organization that 
historically had openly mocked 
and ridiculed Native American 
culture. The organization, then 
called Michigamua, reportedly 
appropriated Native American 
culture, going so far as using

The Cube on the University 

of Michigan’s campus, located 

next to the Michigan Union, is 

a staple for prospective student 

tours, Instagram picture and club 

meetings. Now, thanks to a group of 

Michigan Engineering students, a 

new cube has come to campus — this 

time, in the form of a Rubik’s Cube 

on North Campus.

The project, which was unveiled 

on Thursday in the southwest 

corner on the second floor of the 

G.G. Brown Building, was created 

and designed by two teams of 

mechanical engineering students.

The first group of students — 

Kelsey Hockstad, Dan Hiemstra, 

Martin Harris and Samuelina 

Wright — worked on the cube for 

two years, but graduated in 2016. A 

new group of students took over the 

project this year, with the original 

team advising them. 

The idea for the cube came on 

Pi Day in 2014, when two students 

were hanging out in the College of 

Engineering honors office, playing 

with a Rubik’s Cube. Suddenly, one 

of the students in the office, Harris, 

had a groundbreaking idea: He 

wanted to make a massive version, as 

a competitor to the cube on Central 

Campus.

Harris, who now works as an 

engineer for Herman Miller in 

Holland, has always liked playing 

with Rubik’s Cubes, according to a 

Detroit Free Press article.

“The Rubik’s Cube has been a 

consistent source of relaxation and 

mystery for me over the years, which 

is what I love most about it,” he said. 

“Since high school, I have thought 

of it as a physical representation of 

entropy. By inputting enough work, 

it’s possible to make the cube more 

organized, but its natural tendency is 

toward chaos.”

The idea got approved as a 

capstone senior design project, 

and so, a group of mechanical 

engineering students were tasked 

with creating a cube that people 

would be able to spin from all sides. 

“This is a truly amazing and 

unique kinematic mechanism that 

functions as a Rubik’s Cube,” Noel 

Perkins, a professor of mechanical 

engineering and adviser to the 

students, said in the same article.

Perkins noted the production 

of the cube is especially impressive, 

given the size of the project.

“There 

is no other 

human-

manipulable 

cube like 

this, to the 

best of our 

knowledge,” 

he said. “So 

to be very 

precise, it is 

the world’s 

largest 

stationary, 

human-manipulable Rubik’s Cube.”

Engineering senior Ryan Kuhn, 

one of the developers and producers 

of the project, is excited about having 

a cube on North Campus that can 

compete with the Central Campus 

landmark.

“Now North Campus has an 

iconic cube of our own,” he said.

City Council will go ahead with 

a vote on a $10 million contract to 
sell the downtown Library Lot 
to Chicago-based real estate firm 
Core Spaces during its April 17 
meeting, despite the raising of legal 
questions regarding the contract 
by 
former 
Councilmember 

Stephen Kunselman.

Kunselman raised concerns 

the sale of the lot to a private firm 
would jeopardize the tax-exempt 
status of the Build America 
Bonds that were used to fund 
construction of the surface and 
underground parking lots the 
Library Lot is currently used for. 
Should the council approve the 
contract, the city will still continue 
operation of the underground lot.

According to Councilmember 

Zachary Ackerman (D–Ward 3), 
the contract does not put the status 

of the bonds at risk, based on the 
legal advice of Dykema Gossett 
PLLC, the city’s outside bond 
counsel. One of Kunselman’s main 
concerns was that a 2012 memo 
from Dykema was not signed and 
did not carry legal weight.

“Basically, the 8/9/12 Bond 

Counsel memo was written in 
response to the ‘hypothetical’ 
and certainly one would expect 
Bond Counsel to stand by their 
‘unnamed and unsigned’ advice 
on the ‘hypothetical’ cause they 
can’t be held accountable for that 
if the Core Space ‘private use’ 
proposal of the ‘bond financed 
facility’ is found to ‘jeopardize the 
tax-advantage status of the bonds,’ 
“ Kunselman wrote in an email 
Thursday to the council.

Ackerman confirmed that even 

if the legal advice from Dykema 
were invalid, it is insured, meaning 
any cost incurred to the city as 
a result would be covered by 
Dykema.

“So this issue was put to 

rest five years ago, and like a 
lot of things, information gets 
buried over time, especially 
when they’re legal findings,” 
Ackerman said. “It re-emerged 
now, as we’re approaching the 
vote, and the concern is that this 
memo from our bond counsel, 
Dykema, was never signed. 
We have since confirmed with 
Dykema that they still hold their 
finding to be true, and that any 
memo issued to a client is legally 
justifiable and covered by their 
insurance.”

Responding to the email from 

Kunselman, Mary Joan Fales, 
a senior assistant city attorney, 
noted the absence of a signature 
on the memo did not invalidate 
the advice or its insurance.

“Dykema’s 
professional 

insurance 
coverage 
applies 

to legal advice rendered in a 
memorandum to a client to the 
same extent as legal advice 

rendered in the form of an 
opinion letter,” she wrote. 
“Neither the manner in which 
the legal advice is rendered 
nor the inclusion or absence 
of a signature create any 
liability exposure for the City 
or alters the City’s right to rely 
on the legal advice provided. 
Bond Counsel has specifically 
confirmed 
applicability 
of 

insurance 
coverage 
and 

that 
the 
memorandum 

was 
prepared 
with 
the 

understanding the City would 
be relying on it.”

In his email, Kunselman 

suggested 
an 
alternative 

revenue-generating plan for 
use of the Library Lot –– 
building another library. This, 
he noted, didn’t run the risk of 
using the bond-funded lot for 
a private purpose, and the plot 
of land across the street, on 
which the current downtown 
district library stands, could 
be sold for private use.

Continuing the conversations 

started during the Asian and 
Pacific Islander American Summit 
in March, a panel on A/PIAs in 
academia was held Thursday 
evening, bringing together seven 
panelists from across all levels 
at the University of Michigan 
to answer questions about their 
experiences in the field from 
moderator and event organizer 
Paulina Fraser, a Ph.D. candidate 
in the School of Education, and 
from the audience.

Fraser 
said 
the 
summit 

inspired her to organize this event 
as a capstone to A/PIA Heritage 
Month.

“After going to the summit, 

I wanted to do something that 
combined 
both 
the 
graduate 

students, faculty, post-docs and 
undergraduates and just get some 
exposure, in terms of who are the 
A/PIA students and faculty here,” 
Fraser said. “Just to increase 
awareness 
to 
undergraduates 

or other community members 
who might be thinking about 
(academia) but have never seen 
themselves represented here.”

Kalia Vang, a Hmong-American 

and master’s student in the School 
of Public Policy, came to the 
event because one of her friends 
was a panelist, but felt she could 
relate to the stories of all seven 
speakers and appreciated the 
representation Fraser mentioned.

“As one of few Hmong students 

here on campus … I think it’s a 
huge accomplishment but also 
a unique burden to be someone 
with a background where your 
community is not represented 
in academic spaces,” Vang said. 
“Coming here is sort of a great way 
to learn about the experiences 
of other Asian Americans from 
similar backgrounds and just sort 
of learn how to deal with some of 
the microaggressions or unique 
challenges that come with it.”

The 
event 
began 
with 

introductions from each speaker. 
Though the speakers all came 
from unique backgrounds, many 
themes 
appeared 
throughout 

each of their individual stories. 
One of these themes included the 
search for visibility and others 
who looked like them in their 
educational 
experiences. 
Nue 

Lee, a Ph.D. student in the School 
of Education, articulated this in 
her introduction.

“What 
led 
me 
to 
the 

(University’s) program was my 
overall undergraduate experience 
of being the oldest of seven from a 
refugee family and being the first 
to go to college,” Lee said. “When 
I got to college … I didn’t see 

myself reflected in the research, 
whether it was in the textbooks or 
in the scholarly research that was 
being read.”

Amy Stillman, professor and 

director of the A/PIA Studies 
program, came to the University 
in 1989 to help grow the A/PIA 
Studies program. She, too, went 
into academia because she felt the 
need to advocate for herself in a 
place where there was no one else 
to do so.

“I had this wake-up moment 

in an anthropology class about 
Hawaiians, which was taught by 
a non-Hawaiian … who made a 
point of saying the real, traditional 
culture of Hawaiians was dead 
… contemporary Hawaiians had 
moved so far away that we were 
living in cultural degradation,” 
Stillman said. “And I remember 
thinking … if I want to talk back 
to these people with any degree of 
credibility, I need a Ph.D. too.”

After introductions, the panel 

moved into a discussion on 
mentorship. Many of the speakers 
talked about an inability to find 
mentors of A/PIA heritage in 
their earlier education. Laura-
Ann Jacobs, a Ph.D. student in 
the School of Education, said 
while her dissimilar mentors 
still provided her with valuable 
assistance, there was something 
important in having a mentor to 
whom she could actually relate.

“When 
I 
was 
choosing 

graduate schools, there were 
some programs where my adviser 
would have been a man, someone 
with a different identity from me, 
and I thought there’s something 
here that I’m not sure that you’re 
going to give me what I need 
and fulfill me personally on this 
emotional journey of grad school,” 
Jacobs said.

Other panelists talked about 

the importance of not just finding 
your own mentors, but also being 
someone else’s mentor. Bernard 
Ellorin, a lecturer from the Center 
for Southeast Asian Studies, also 
brought up the idea of support 
groups between peers as a way to 
cope with the challenges of being 
a minority and graduate school in 
general.

“(I’ve dealt with challenges) by 

having a small group of friends 
and individuals who are in the 
same position as you, who know 
the same struggles and who you 
can actually confide in,” Ellorin 
said.

The 
panel 
then 
turned 

to a discussion on imposter 
syndrome — the idea that a high-
achieving individual might feel 
like they don’t deserve their 
accomplishments and are afraid 
of being exposed as a fraud.

Carmen Ye, a master’s student 

in the School of Public Policy, said 

she had a difficult time realizing 
that she actually deserved many 
of the things she’d earned in her 
early academic career. She told 
the story of working hard to be 
accepted into a specific program 
as an undergraduate, and feeling 
like she wasn’t worthy when she 
finally got in.

“I spent the whole summer 

believing the program was going 
to send me back to California,” Ye 
said. “I’d already made it here, I 
was in the classes, but I just felt 
like something bad was going to 
happen and that I didn’t deserve 
to be here. One solution to that 
is I need to keep telling myself 
every day that I am here because 
I deserve to be.”

Later on in the talk, an 

audience 
member 
posed 
the 

question of when and how to call 
out a superior’s microaggressions. 
All the panelists acknowledged 
the difficulty of this question and 
said there was no one true answer. 
Jacobs said when she encounters 
a situation like this, she tries to 
pose the statement as a question 
back to whoever said it to make 
them aware of how what they said 
sounded.

“I’d say that’s a really difficult 

question, 
especially 
being 

conscious 
of 
relationships 
of 

power,” Jacobs said. “It makes 
you want to silent yourself and 
not speak up for yourself — girl, 
I’ve been there. But just being 
like, ‘What do you mean by that?’ 
and just repeat it like that, it 
seems less threatening, like the 
best advice for an in-the-moment 
situation.”

Stillman built off that answer, 

bringing 
up 
the 
Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion plan the 
University rolled out this fall. She 
said the plan isn’t reaching the 
department level, where many 
of these microaggressions and 
harmful actions are taking place.

“How can we close the gap 

between what our experience is 
in the citizenry and make sure 
that those committed to the 
principles of DEI are very, very 
clear about what’s going on?” she 
said. “Speaking up at the moment 
of microaggressions, not letting 
it go by, is an important personal 
step … it also is a very important 
step in this institutional journey 
we’re on.”

The panel ended with each 

speaker giving the audience a 
piece of advice they try to live by. 
Lee summed up the purpose of 
the panel with her statement.

“I think it’s important to 

remember your roots and see if 
that can develop through your 
research agenda or your studies 
or the classes you want to take,” 
Lee said. “That will help develop 
growth and strengthen identity.”

of Michigan Hillel for two 
years, attended the event as a 
culmination of his participation 
in Hillel. Like Kalfus, all four 
of Katz’s grandparents were 
Holocaust survivors.

“For me, I have a regret 

that I didn’t get more involved 
in this group, because this 
type of thing and Holocaust 
remembrance is very important 
to me,” he said. “So this last 
event is a little of me still 
getting involved even though 
I didn’t take on a leadership 
position in this group.”

Similar to the other students 

who attended the event, Katz 

emphasized the importance of 
hearing stories from Holocaust 
survivors.

“Many of them are old and 

aren’t going to be here in a 
couple of years, so that’s really 
important to me, getting to 
know them, because stories are 
stories, but we if can actually 
put them to a face, it means so 
much more,” he said.

IISS coordinator Saquib Ali 

Usman, a doctoral student in 
anthropology at the University 
of Michigan, said it became clear 
in planning the event the “era of 
Trump” is incredibly pertinent to 
Islamic studies today.

He 
referenced 
American 

scholar Sherman Jackson, who 
describes Islamic studies today 
as Islamic studies 2.0. Islamic 
studies 1.0, he said, refers to the 
discursive study of Islam through 
an academic setting, using the 
tools and genealogy of studies. 
Islamic studies 2.0 refers to 
putting 1.0 into real-life political 
situations in which an event is 
unfolding.

“I think Islamic studies is 

becoming much more tied to 
social realities of Muslims living 
in the world and in the U.S., as 
opposed to some ideological 
disconnected, disembodied study 
of Islamic studies,” he said.

Samiah Haque, the interim 

Islamic 
studies 
program 

coordinator, said the purpose of 
the symposium was to relate the 
work of individuals to the current 
political climate.

“Considering 
the 
political 

climate, we thought it would be 
a very timely seminar and really 
this conference is about how 
different people in the field of 
Islamic studies are relating to 
what’s happening right now in 
terms of what they’re working 
on,” she said.

She 
emphasized 
the 

interdisciplinary nature of the 
symposium, 
which 
includes 

storytelling, 
arts 
and 
music 

performances, 
among 
others. 

Presenters 
were 
graduate 

students, 
professors, 
social 

activists and scholars from the 
University and other institutions 
around the world.

Sara 
Tahir, 
a 
graduate 

student studying anthropology 
at Michigan State University, 
presented earlier in the day on 
ethical labor with regard to 
Muslim-American women after 
the election.

Tahir 
said 
she 
enjoyed 

Spellberg’s lecture and the overall 
opportunity to work alongside 
students pursuing similar studies.

“It was really interesting,” she 

said. “I’m so glad it was organized 
because I got to meet people 
from the University of Michigan, 
especially people who are people 
of color, and people who are 
working … who have a similar sort 
of process with respect to what 
is going on in the world today, 
globally as well. Of course, the 
United States is included what is 
happening in the United States 
and how we’re projecting that to 
the global scale.”

“Many inside and outside the 
university had begun to refer 
to the center as Mcity, not just 
the test facility.”

Mcity 
Deputy 
Director 

Carrie Morton believes this 
name change will also help 
connect the various projects 
taking place across Mcity.

“We 
are 
now 
uniting 

two 
separate 
brands 
that 

represented the full breadth 
of our work and what was 
formerly the MTC, under one 
very 
recognizable 
brand,” 

Morton said. “This allows 
us to really streamline and 
elevate 
our 
voice 
in 
this 

space by getting behind one 
brand, and leverage the brand 
of Mcity which was so well 
recognized.”

The testing ground itself, 

located on the University’s 
North 
Campus, 
will 
now 

be called the Mcity Test 
Facility. 
The 
test 
facility 

allows researchers to conduct 
stringent tests that would 

typically require thousands of 
miles of public roads.

The Mcity Test Facility 

is 
one 
of 
Mcity’s 
three 

main initiatives, which also 
include 
funding 
research 

and partnering with other 
groups, such as the University 
Transportation 
Research 

Institute, to deploy connected 
and automated vehicles on 

the streets of Ann Arbor and 
potentially beyond.

Right 
now, 
Mcity 
has 

partnerships 
with 
65 

companies, spanning various 
industries. Mcity has also 
invested 
approximately 

$16 million in 30 research 
projects such as studies on 
the 
interactions 
of 
motor 

vehicles and bicyclists as well 
as vehicle data collection for 
cloud processing.

“Rebranding 
as 
Mcity 

allows us to focus on one 
brand rather than two, and 
more effectively tell the story 
of the work we’re doing to 
advance the development of 
advanced 
mobility 
vehicles 

and 
technologies,” 
Carney 

said.

According to Carney, the 

renaming 
of 
the 
Mobility 

Transformation 
Center 
to 

Mcity will have no effects on 
Mcity’s funding or mission.

“In fact, I think having 

everything 
under 
the 
one 

brand more completely shares 
our mission,” Morton said.

In regard to future projects, 

Carney and Morton said Mcity 
plans to continue the research 
on 
autonomous 
vehicles, 

which they have spent the past 
years on.

“I don’t think there are 

any significant changes than 
working really hard on our 
plans to continue to execute 
our deployment plans which 
include automated vehicles,” 
Morton said.

Wadley said. “Part of it being a 
therapy dog, you have to have 
a really good temperament. 
Every time you see him, it 
seems like he’s always smiling 
so that always puts people in a 
good mood.”

With 
about 
25 
teams 

assigned 
to 
Michigan 

Medicine, 
Therapaws’s 

therapy dogs can be found at 
Mott, the medical procedures 
unit, the intensive care unit 
as well as the Cardiovascular 
Center. The dogs typically 
visit individual patient rooms 
and interact with groups.

Lana Berry, a volunteer 

supervisor 
and 
liaison 

between 
Therapaws 
and 

Michigan 
Medicine, 
has 

been involved with canine 
therapy for 15 years. Her 
main responsibilities include 
screening the therapy dogs 
and scheduling dog visits to 
medical units in need. Berry 
emphasized the importance 
of the canine-human bond in 
the healing process.

“A lot of people, when 

they are in the hospital, are 
missing their own pets, so just 
being able to hug or touch or 
pet a furry dog makes them 
more 
comfortable,” 
Berry 

said. “Studies have shown 
that it reduces blood pressure, 
reduces 
anxiety 
and 
just 

overall (promotes) well-being 
for the patients.”

Wadley, 
who 
refers 
to 

himself as the dog whisperer, 
has found the patients at 
Mott respond to visits from 
Legend. He added the patients 
gravitate 
toward 
Legend’s 

gentle side.

This is especially the case 

for a young girl who suffered 
from a traumatic dog bite. 
She initially felt uneasy with 
the idea of petting Legend, so 
Wadely suggested she start 
petting 
Legend 
from 
the 

back, working her way up to 
his head. Eventually, she felt 
comfortable enough to give 
Legend a treat.

“She started smiling and 

she felt better,” Wadley said. 
“Before we left, she gave him 
a hug. That just reconfirms 
what therapy is all about, 
especially 
for 
kids, 
just 

making sure they have really 
good experiences.”

Wadley 
has 
found 

volunteering 
at 
Mott 
to 

be 
especially 
impactful 

because 
of 
the 
anxieties 

that accompany being such a 
young patient.

“A lot of times when we see 

some of these kids, they are 
going into surgery, so they are 
feeling a little bit nervous and 
apprehensive about getting 
the procedures that they are 
having, so bringing a dog there 
calms them down a little bit 
and provides a distraction,” 
Wadley said.

The main goal of Therapaws 

is to bring comfort and joy to 
those young and old, in the 
form of canine therapy. Karen 
O’Connor, the president of 
Therapaws of Michigan, has 
been in the business of therapy 
dogs for nearly 20 years.

“I think canine therapy 

is special because it takes 
(the patient’s) mind off of 
whatever is going on in their 
life and in their illness,” 
O’Connor said. “I think it’s a 
huge stress reliever. The dogs 
are entertaining, they remind 
them of their pets.”

I think having 

everything under 

the one brand 

completely shares 

our mission 

Native American artifacts and 
cultural references, such as 
headdresses and statues, and 
performing Native American-
like rituals. 

“There were many protests 

held by Native students around 
10 years ago that led to the land 
grant plaque and the removal of 
support for Michigamua,” Gant 
said.

Michigamua has since been 

renamed Order of Angell, an 
organization which focuses on 
honoring senior leadership at the 
University. 

An exhibit on the history 

of student protest on campus, 
which is located on the sidewalks 
of Angell Hall, highlights the 
periods 
of 
student 
activism 

during World War I, the civil 
rights movement and Vietnam 
War, but doesn’t discuss Native 
Americans.

LSA 
freshman 
Maitland 

Bowen, who is of Native American 
heritage, 
discussed 
how 
the 

exhibit shows the University 
has made significant progress 
over the years, but also pointed 
to how the University neglects 
to 
recognize 
the 
profound 

significance Native Americans 
have had in the University’s 
history.

“The fact that this pop-up 

plaque seems so novel points 
to a real problem,” Bowen said. 
“The Native land grant should 
not be something we remember 
once every 200 years, it should 
be something the University 
consciously 
acknowledges, 

respects and appreciates every 
day.”

She described how, due to the 

small population of students who 
identify as Native American — 
0.2 percent of enrolled students 
as of 2015 — the University does 
not feel a sense of urgency to 
fully recognize the University’s 
history with Native Americans. 

“The University doesn’t have 

to answer to a large Native 
student population because they 
don’t have a large Native student 
population,” Bowen said.

Referring to the ways in which 

the University represents Native 
American students, Bowen stated 
that the University still has a long 
way to go.

“They must make a conscious 

and 
consistent 
effort 
to 

acknowledge Native Americans’ 
roles in the history of the 
University and to support their 
roles in its future,” she said.

Philip Deloria, professor of 

American culture and Native 
American studies, spoke about 
the significance of the pop-up art 
exhibit.

“It’s a great gesture, but it’s 

a gesture that also reveals the 
invisibility of Indian people 
kind of in general on campus 
and in American society as a 
whole,” Deloria said. “They 
make up about 1.5 percent of 
the population, they’re easily 
ignored and that’s been the case 
on the campus for a while.”

A

s a public policy major, 
I’m well aware of all the 
research, thought and 

work that goes into creating 
policy. Good policy 
isn’t the result of 
exaggerated claims 
made on campaign 
trails 
to 
rile 
up 

crowds. 
Rather, 

it’s the outcome of 
experts and analysts 
examining a problem 
and coming up with 
creative 
responses 

based on the analysis 
of hard data. There is 
a disconnect between the kind 
of policy that gathers cheers in 
stadiums and the kind of policy 
that actually works well — and 
this disconnect seems to be 
expanding in the age of Trump. 

This dynamic has negative 

implications 
for 
successful 

implementation of good policy, 
which are compounded when 
legislators and presidents shift 
their focus from doing what 
is the best policy for their 
constituents to overzealously 
trimming 
budgets. 
Being 

frugal and conscientious with 
taxpayer money is essential, of 
course. But cutting programs 
that have proven themselves 
successful and that improve 
the lives of citizens should 
withstand budget cuts, even 
if 
they 
don’t 
get 
crowds 

cheering or don’t attract a lot 
of attention. 

On the national level, budget 

cuts to beloved programs often 
draw outrage, which can help 
insulate the programs from 
losing their funding or can 
attract outside donors. This 
can be seen in the case of 
Meals on Wheels, a program 
that provides healthy meals to 
senior citizens while checking 
in on their well-being, which 
was slated to lose funding 
on Trump’s budget proposal. 
This 
proposed 
cut 
drew 

national media attention and 
was bad press for the Trump 
administration. If Congress 
chooses to carry on with the 
decrease in funding for Meals 
on Wheels, it will likely face 

continued 
public 
backlash. 

Either 
way, 
the 
program 

saw a surge in donations 
and 
volunteers 
after 
the 

proposed cuts were 
announced, 
so 
it 

probably 
won’t 

suffer too much as a 
consequence. 

The same can’t 

be said for local 
programs 
and 

policy. 
There 
is 

less attention paid 
to 
state 
budget 

proposals, 
and 

there 
is 
less 

outrage 
when 
successful 

programs get cut. There are 
likely many reasons for this, 
such as the decline in local 
news reporting. 

A prime example of this 

lack of local interest is “10 
Cents a Meal for School Kids 
and Farms,” a pilot program 
that “provid(es) schools with 
match incentive funding up to 
10 cents per meal to purchase 
and 
serve 
Michigan-grown 

produce to an estimated 48,000 
students in 16 grant-winning 
school districts.” The pilot 
program was implemented in 
September 2016, and “10 Cents 
a Meal” has already proven 
a 
worthwhile 
investment. 

Economically, it has increased 
business for local farmers, 
distributors 
and 
producers. 

Nutritionally, it has exposed 
school children to a wide 
variety of locally produced 
vegetables and improved their 
access to healthy food. 

Many 
studies 
have 

demonstrated the importance 
of 
childhood 
nutrition. 

Proper nutrition is necessary 
for 
fighting 
infections. 

Undernutrition 
can 
result 

in 
decreased 
cognitive 

functioning 
and 
activity 

levels, among other things. A 
healthy diet can offset health 
issues 
such 
as 
childhood 

obesity. Healthy eating habits 
are particularly critical in 
a 
school 
setting 
because, 

as the Centers for Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention 

points out, “Schools are in a 
unique position to provide 
students with opportunities 
to learn about and practice 
healthy 
eating 
behaviors.” 

The case for high-quality, 
nutritional food in schools 
is hard to ignore. Delivering 
this healthy diet to kids 
in a sustainable way that 
promotes the local economy? 
That’s just good policy. 

“10 
Cents 
a 
Meal,” 

though, 
didn’t 
appear 
on 

Gov. Rick Snyder’s budget 
recommendation for the 2018 
fiscal year. It remains to 
be seen if the program will 
make it into the final budget, 
which will be determined by 
the House and Senate. This 
is a program that is good for 
Michigan, and cutting it just 
wouldn’t make sense. 

National 
outrage 
over 

unnecessary 
budget 
cuts 

had an impact. Why can’t we 
take that anger to the state 
level? I implore everyone to 
get in touch with their state 
representatives 
and 
make 

it clear that programs like 
“10 Cents a Meal” shouldn’t 
be on the chopping block. 
Connecting farms to schools 
might not be the kind of policy 
that gets people riled up to 
attend rallies and vote, but 
it’s the kind of policy that 
makes positive changes in 
communities. 
That 
should 

count for something.

E

very 
year, 
students 

leave their homes to 
attend 
college 
with 

the hope of achieving their 
personal and academic goals. 
While 
acknowledging 
that 

students have diverse goals, 
many individuals share the 
aim of obtaining a college 
degree and participating in 
their campus communities in 
various capacities (e.g., Greek 
life, service learning, etc.). 
Through these involvements, 
students can learn more about 
their 
interests 
and 
other 

communities while becoming 
engaged 
citizens. 
Though 

students can engage in many 
opportunities, 
one 
question 

remains: “What is the role of a 
higher education institution?” 

 Recently in one of my 

classes we read and discussed 
“Citizen Formation Is Not 
Our Job” by Stanley Fish. 
Fish states that “promoting 
virtuous citizenship is no 
doubt a worthy goal, but it is 
not an academic goal, because 
... it is a political goal.” I am 
a current graduate student 
in the Center for the Study 
of Higher and Postsecondary 
Education and a firm believer 
in 
providing 
students 

opportunities to participate in 
activities that will challenge 
their ideas and skills. This 
article failed to acknowledge 
that civic engagement and 
service 
learning 
provide 

students 
opportunities 
to 

learn more about communities 
and other individuals. 

 Citizen formation is the role 

of higher education, because 

it equips students with the 
tools they need to engage in 
communities 
and 
become 

informed citizens. Institutions 
should provide students service 
learning 
opportunities 
to 

reflect on their role and the 
impact they want to have even 
after they leave the institution. 

Fish 
states 
that 

“volunteerism is in general 
a good thing, it is not an 
academic thing and those who 
take it up should not receive 
academic credit for doing so.” 
Volunteerism 
is 
beneficial 

to both the student and the 
community, but the point is 
not whether a student should 
or should not receive academic 
credit 
for 
volunteering. 

Instead, we should ask what 
the students learned through 
their engagement in the service 
learning opportunities.

Though 
higher 
education 

provides academic coursework 
that will give students the skills 
they need to secure a job, the 
overall goal of higher education 
should 
be 
to 
ensure 
that 

students will become committed 
citizens. Service learning allows 
students to learn about the 
social issues that affect their 
involvement 
in 
communities 

beyond graduation. 

As an undergraduate student, 

I participated in the Alternative 
Break 
programs. 
This 

experience challenged me to 
reflect on lessons learned in the 
classroom, to collaborate with 
individuals whom I otherwise 
would 
have 
never 
engaged 

with and to learn about the 
challenges communities face. 

Participating in service learning 
allowed me think about how 
my work affects communities 
around me and how I can make 
an impact. 

One argument Fish proposes 

is that service learning has 
a 
political 
undertone 
that 

typically 
leans 
toward 
a 

more liberal point of view. I 
would challenge that belief 
and say that service learning 
can be done without political 
agendas. 
Students 
can 

participate in various service 
learning opportunities, such as 
literacy or tutoring programs, 
reading to hospital patients 
and coaching a youth sports 
team, just to name a few. If 
the concern is truly that there 
is a political agenda behind 
service learning, students can 
decide whether or not to not 
engage in these projects or 
find one that aligns more with 
their interests. 

As we try to define what the 

role of higher education is, we 
need to remember that these 
institutions benefit both students 
and 
society. 
By 
providing 

students with service learning 
opportunities, 
students 
are 

challenged to learn inside and 
outside the classroom. If the role 
of a higher education institution 
is to prepare students for the 
future, challenging students to 
get involved in service learning 
opportunities allows them to 
increase their civic engagement 
and make a lasting impact in 
their community. 

What is the role of a higher education insitution?

R

ecently, I had a rather 
polarizing 
incident 

at 
the 
U.S.-Canada 

border. During a visit to 
Detroit, my friend 
and 
I 
spotted 

the 
sign 
pointing 

out 
the 
Detroit-

Windsor 
tunnel 

and 
spontaneously 

decided to go to 
Canada, 
because 

why 
not? 
As 
we 

drove 
under 
the 

Detroit 
River, 

adrenaline 
from 

the prospect of our 
adventure 
rushed 
through 

our veins, but our excitement 
came to a quick halt when 
a Canadian border services 
agent asked us the purpose of 
our spontaneous trip. 

Lost for words and without 

a plan, we replied, “Just 
because,” and the greatest 
look of incredulity, distrust 
and judgment crossed her 
face. Now, I realize that it is 
a border control officer’s job 
to treat two teenagers in a 
rental car and no plans with 
suspicion. 
But, 
the 
scorn 

with 
which 
she 
repeated, 

“You’re going to Canada just 
because?” felt uncomfortably 
reminiscent of the countless 
times I’ve been asked about 
my future career plans by 
adults, only to be met with 
disappointment when I cannot 
provide a concrete answer. 
The disbelief in her voice 
made me feel small.

I came to college with 

romantic notions of it being 
a place to “find myself,” but 
it didn’t take long to realize 
there wasn’t as much freedom 
to explore my interests as I 
initially thought. Almost from 
the moment I first stepped on 
campus, I was asked left and 
right about what my major was. 
It seemed to be the second most 
important piece of information 
about me behind my name. 
Though most students do not 
declare 
their 
majors 
until 

the end of their sophomore 
year, there is an unbelievable 
pressure on freshmen to have 
their next four years planned 
out much, much earlier.

While at the beginning of 

the year it was still relatively 
common to hear people were 

undecided about the future, 
now the undeclared are rare 
enigmas. 
Just 
last 
week, 

I 
attended 
an 
orientation 

for 
my 
summer 

study abroad trip 
through the College 
of 
Engineering, 

and of the 30-odd 
freshmen who were 
in 
attendance, 
it 

seemed as though 
all of them, save 
one, 
knew 
what 

their majors were.

As an engineer, I 

feel that there is a 

necessity to decide early on. 
The large number of credits 
required does not provide a lot 
of wiggle room to explore other 
interests while graduating on 
time. Even coming in with a 
decent number of AP credits, I 
was dismayed to learn from my 
adviser that I may need to take 

an extra semester to complete 
both my major in biomedical 
engineering and my minor in 
creative writing. This was a 
major point of contention for my 
parents, who immediately urged 
I drop the minor. “What are 
you going to do with a creative 
writing minor anyway?”

Truth be told, probably 

nothing. But my minor is 
the most “exploration” of a 
subject matter near and dear 
to my heart that I can muster. 
Isn’t that the point of college 
— to learn and take classes 
that interest and challenge 
you? 
Unfortunately, 
these 

days, college seems more like 

a stepping stone to greater 
things, an obstacle that must 
be crossed in order to secure a 
well-paying job.

I’ve been cautioned against 

majoring 
in 
biomedical 

engineering more times than 
I 
can 
count. 
Apparently, 

the job prospects with just 
an 
undergraduate 
degree 

in 
biomedical 
engineering 

are 
poor 
in 
comparison 

to job prospects with an 
undergraduate degree in other 
engineering majors, such as 
mechanical 
engineering 
or 

electrical engineering. While 
it’s important to look out for 
your future, it doesn’t seem 
right to major in something 
you’re not completely devoted 
to and take classes that you’re 
not really interested in for 
four years with the hopes that 
you’ll be “employable” at the 
end of it.

“Undecided” 
shouldn’t 

equate 
to 
“indecisive,” 

and it surely is no label to 
shame. Freshmen should be 
encouraged to take classes 
that 
sound 
interesting 
to 

them and be able to explore 
their options instead of being 
pressured to decide on the rest 
of their life at the age of 18.

There are several schools 

around the country, including 
Harvard and Yale, that have 
“shopping 
periods” 
at 
the 

beginning of the semester, so 
students can “shop” different 
classes to see if they are 
interested. The University of 
Michigan could really benefit 
from something similar, so the 
focus is on the course content 
and the learning instead of 
simply fulfilling a requirement 
for future endeavors.

There is merit to concrete 

plans, 
but 
college 
seems 

like a wasted opportunity 
if all four years are spent 
fulfilling some “formula” for 
future employment. We are 
so fortunate to attend such 
a prestigious, well-endowed 
university, and the only way 
to fully utilize all it has to 
offer is to occasionally toss 
the map into the backseat and 
take a spontaneous trip off the 
beaten path.

COURTESY OF SANAM MARVI

CLASSICAL MUSIC COLUMN

Springtime, breeze and 

Bach on the lawn

Wednesday morning I knew 

exactly what I was going to 
write about tonight. I woke 
up to find the whole day 
directed toward the object 
of my desire, a concert by 
the ensembles A Far Cry and 
Roomful of Teeth taking place 
in the evening. Last week I 
interviewed 
the 
composers 

and a violinist involved in it 
for this publication. This week 
I attended a discussion by the 
composer Ted Hearne, whose 
music and presence was an 
integral part of the program. I 
hadn’t been this excited about 
any one single thing for several 
months, at least. I was going 
to attend the concert, go home 
and pour my heart out about 
Caroline Shaw, Ted Hearne and 
the incomparable virtuosity of 
these two ensembles.

But I can’t write about it 

now. I just can’t find the words. 
It was simply too good, and 
happened too recently. It seems 
cliché, but it’s true. I’m still 
internalizing the experience, 
and before I try to tell you 
anything about it, I have to live 
with it for a bit. But here we are, 
and this is my last column of the 
year. So I’ll make this promise 
— in a few months time, when 
we all return to Ann Arbor, I’ll 
have figured out something to 
say. But in the meantime, let’s 
talk about Bach.

During my final two years 

of high school, I studied music 
as a boarding student, at a 
school that was technically 
part of a university. Most of us 
students lived on campus, and 
— lacking a car or other means 
of 
transportation 
— 
that’s 

basically where we spent all 
of our time. Usually our days 
were filled with the work of 
honing our art, but as the end 
of the academic year drew in 
upon us in the springtime, 
often we would find a few 
hours to sit and simply enjoy 
the newly pleasant weather. 
At the heart of campus there 
was a little collection of grass, 
trees and picnic tables where I 
and some friends would sit and 
read.

Across the grass there was 

sometimes 
a 
woman 
who, 

on particularly sunny and 
pleasant days, would practice 
the violin in the open air. It isn’t 
an extremely common thing, 
I’ve found, for a musician to 

practice their instrument in a 
place where they can be easily 
overheard by others, especially 
other 
musicians. 
Generally 

the fear of judgment might 
dissuade one from such an 
act, but this violinist seemed 
to have no such reservations. 
And she was, after all, very 
good, and the weather was 
very attractive. But as I would 
sit reading, I would listen 
half-attentively to her music, 
which, almost invariably, was 
the solo music of J.S. Bach. 

Bach is a name that is nearly 

universally recognizable. Even 
those who aren’t musicians or 
listeners of classical generally 
know something about him 
(even if it’s only his Toccata 
in D Minor). And this is with 
good reason: He is, after all, 
generally 
regarded 
as 
the 

greatest composer in all of 
history, a reputation which 
I find to be well deserved. 
Everything he touched came 
out perfect. There is just no 
bad piece by Bach, as far as I 
can tell. But if I were to pick 
just one little corner of his 
music to use to introduce him 
to others, it would have to 
be his music for solo string 
instruments. 

Nearly everyone is familiar 

with the first movement of the 
first cello suite (if you think 
you’re not, go listen to it and 
realize you’re wrong), but 
that famous piece is merely 
the beginning of a huge body 
of work that is breathtaking. 
Over the course of his life, 
Bach composed three sonatas 
and three partitas for solo 
violin and six suites for solo 
cello, somewhere around five 
hours of music. All of it is 
worth listening to, but there 
are definitely moments that 
stand out. The Chaconne from 
the Partita in D Minor comes 
to mind, as does the Fugue 
from the Sonata in C Major. 

One of the most appealing 

things 
about 
Bach’s 
solo 

string music is the air of 
simplicity it conveys. While 
it is (like all of Bach’s music) 
extremely 
complex 
and 

nuanced, somehow he is able 
to convey the impression of 
plainness — plainness not in 
the sense of something boring 
or ordinary, but in the sense 
of a sort of forthrightness, 
a lack of pretension. The 
sound of someone playing 
alone, almost to themselves, 
transmits a feeling that the 
music is somehow speaking 
directly to you, that you are 
hearing something which no 
one else is hearing. More than 
that, it simply sounds truthful, 
somehow. 
The 
stunning 

violinist Hilary Hahn once 
remarked that she hasn’t gone 
a day since she was eight years 
old 
without 
playing 
Bach, 

because he is “the touchstone 
that keeps my playing honest.” 
This honesty is something that 
you can hear in the music.

And maybe it is just the 

associations I have with this 
music, but to me it sounds like 
something else I inexplicably 
tie to honesty: a sunny day. 
When I hear it I think of 
spring weather, and when I 
find myself in spring weather, 
I want to hear it. Now that it 
seems spring has finally come 
to Ann Arbor for good this 
year, I took a few hours out 
of my week to just sit outside 
and listen to Bach, something 
which I also did last year and a 
practice I highly recommend. 
It’s a meditation of sorts, a 
space that you can create 
outside of the stress and the 
worry of the end of term and of 
finals, a place where you can 
exist as merely yourself, alone 
with the music. 

So, if you can find a moment 

for it, this is my suggestion, 
especially if you are feeling 
the pressure of the close of 
semestre. 
Go 
outside 
and 

take a walk, silently. Meander 
through the Arb or down to the 
Huron. Avoid thinking about 
all the things that trouble 
you. Find a pleasant patch of 
grass, lie down and put on a 
recording of Bach. Exist in 
that moment for as long as 
you can. When you’re done, I 
promise, for whatever reason 
things will be better.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

UMS presents Sufi poetry

“I fill this earthen vessel with 

love for my Beloved / I fill this 
earthen vessel with love for my 
Lord / I fear only the wrath of 
Allah / I fear only the wrath 
of my Lord” — “Mahi Yaar Di 
Gharoli” by Sachal Sarmast, 
Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain

Sanam 
Marvi, 
renowned 

singer of Pakistan and South Asia, 
performs 
many 

poems like “Mahi 
Yaar Di Gharoli” 
in 
the 
native 

languages of her 
country. Trained in 
Sufi and folk music, 
her voice captivates 
audiences with her 
chillingly hypnotic 
and beautiful tones.

Generally, 
Marvi 
performs 

for Pakistani and South Asian 
audiences, where she is in high 
demand. However, she decided to 
return to the United States for her 
fourth tour. 

“[I] saw it as an opportunity 

to perform for non-South Asian 
audiences. [I] felt that this was 
great opportunity to get [my] 
music across” Marvi said through 
translator Arieb Azhar, a guest 
artist performing with Marvi. 

Born in the Pakistani province 

of Sindh, Marvi sings in languages 
such as Sindhi, Saraiki, Punjabi, 
Urdu 
and 
Hindi, 
which 
are 

prevalent around different areas of 
the Indus River. 

“They are connected languages, 

but of course very different,” Marvi 
said. “The message of the poems [I 
sing are] the same.” 

Marvi’s career in music began at 

a very young age. Her father trained 
her, and upon realizing her talent, 

he exposed her to the masters of 
Pakistani classical music. 

“Anyone who wants to get 

into music seriously has to start 
studying from the basics and the 
basics are classical music whether 
you choose to specialize in folk, 
semi classical or classical. But to 
gain a real knowledge of music you 
have to study from the classical 
masters,” Marvi said.

While music in Pakistan is 

different than in the United States, 
it is a highly valued aspect of society. 

Respected 
poets 

write the majority 
of the songs, and 
folk music is an 
important 
part 

of 
carrying 
on 

traditions 
and 

messages of love 
and faith.

“90 percent of 

the folk music in Pakistan consists 
in singing the poetry of the various 
poets of Pakistan who have written 
Sufi poetry in the diverse languages 
of Pakistan. So people sing that 
poetry and take that message 
forward,” Marvi said.

The messages of Sufism strive 

to teach the customs of Pakistan 
and to preserve these traditions 
through song. On a deeper level, 
these songs serve to connect the 
audience with something within 
themselves.

“People say that Sufism is the 

mystical side of Islam, but the Sufis 
themselves say that Sufism is a 
message for all humanity,” Marvi 
said. “The message is an inclusive 
message of universal humanity, 
of connecting with each other as 
human beings before anything else. 
The message is one of connecting 
with the divine inside each of us in 
our own ways and connecting with 
the oneness of all existence.” 

Marvi does not sing in English, 

but that does not prevent anyone 
from 
understanding 
the 
true 

beauty of her lyrics. Whether one 
is fluent in a Pakistani language 
or not, all will be able to relate to 
emotion that Marvi draws from.

“Even 
if 
someone 
doesn’t 

understand the language, they 
will understand the sounds that 
are being created through her 
vocals, through the instruments 
that are being played … Music is 
the same all over the world. Notes 
are the same, being in tune is the 
same … they will understand the 
feeling of communion through the 
performance,” Marvi said. 

Marvi is extremely popular in 

her home country. According to 
Azhar, her success is due to her 
proper training by the masters. 

“It was just a matter of time 

before [I] became exposed to the 
public,” Marvi said. “The first time 
it came about in 2009 when [I] was 
picked up to perform at this very 
respectable television program on 
folk and classical music.” 

Afterwards, 
Coke 
studio, 

financed by Coca Cola, signed 
with Marvi and she has performed 
with them for the past seven years. 
Arieb has also performed with this 
contemporary Pakistan program. 
Marvi’s career skyrocketed from 
there as more and more people 
flocked to hear her mesmerizing 
singing.

“The only message [I] can give 

is to encourage people to come and 
listen to the music. [I hope] to put on 
a great performance,” Marvi said. 

By bringing Sanam Marvi to the 

University, UMS is creating an even 
more diverse array of performers. 
As a solo artist from across the 
globe, Marvi adds to the cultivation 
of the art community in Ann Arbor. 
Her traditions and unique style 
offer a voice for a culture that is 
often overlooked. 

FALLON GATES
Daily Arts Writer

Although last season “Veep” 

closed — more like slammed — 
a door in Selina’s (Julia Louis-
Dreyfus, “Seinfeld”) face, it 
opened another one 
to the possibilities 
following 
her 

rejection 
by 

“both the people 
of 
America 
and 

Congress.” 
The 

acclaimed comedy 
returns 
for 
its 

sixth season after 
Selina’s bid for the presidency 
took a comedically unfortunate 
and unintentionally realistic 
turn — something her character 
is quite familiar with. Though 
now she’s free to explore who 
she is outside of the White 
House, it seems that the show’s 
writers are still figuring out 
what this looks like.

While 
Selina’s 
loss 

unknowingly foresaw the turn 
the real-world election would 
take following its finale, this 
season draws on the events 
marking the life of a former 
president, 
taking 
its 
story 

away from the White House 
into uncharted territory for 
the series. Not many shows 

can leave audiences on the 
note of uncertainty that the 
series did in the previous 
season finale. “Veep” did so 
with the understanding that 
the inherent humor central to 
the show is Selina’s inability 
to get what she wants. But this 

left the show in 
a tricky spot, 
fragmenting 
its 
ensemble 

cast 
whose 

hilarity 
is 

rooted in their 
dynamic, 
and 

disassociating 
almost entirely 

from the political sphere in 
which most of its comedic 
action took place.

However, 
the 
season 

premiere does a beautiful job 
reintroducing its cast, newly 
situated 
in 
their 
careers 

following their ejection from 
the White House. The premiere 
opens on a CBS Morning 
interview between Selina and 
Dan Egan (Reid Scott, “Dean”), 
in which she describes the past 
year following her loss and her 
reacquaintance with herself. 
As she and Dan awkwardly 
banter, we glimpse Amy (Anna 
Chlumsky, “The End of the 
Tour”) 
watching 
from 
her 

new 
fiancé’s 
congressional 

campaign headquarters, before 
cutting to Ben (Kevin Dunn, 
“Code Black”) watching from 
the Uber office where he’s 
clearly the oldest and most 
out-of-touch employee. And 
from 
Mike’s 
(Matt 
Walsh, 

“Ted”) TV, we see children’s 
programming, marking his new 
life as a stay-at-home dad — 
though his ambition to return 
to work is soon revealed.

Following last season, it 

was unclear where Selina’s 
staffers would end up, but we 
now find them in scenarios in 
which their personalities are 
least likely to gel smoothly. 
Amy’s crass language is found 
offensive by the small-town 
campaign 
staff 
and 
Ben’s 

lack of a social conscience is 
found distasteful by the other 
Uber 
employees. 
Though 

their fundamental humor as 
characters is well-maintained, 
the desire to see them reunite 
is not lost.

Rather than focusing on 

the team’s former proximity, 
the new season taps into 
the unexplored potential of 
Selina’s 
relationships 
with 

some of the other characters 
— 
among 
which 
are 
her 

ex-husband 
Andrew 
(David 

Pasquesi, “Groundhog Day”), 
former bodyguard and new 

daughter-in-law 
Marjorie 

(Clea 
DuVall, 
“Argo”) 
and 

most importantly, her devoted 
body man Gary (Tony Hale, 
“Arrested 
Development”). 

Gary and Selina’s relationship, 
though intertwined from the 
start, has taken a turn into 
new territory, as he grows even 
more protective of her and 
becomes 
hilariously 
clingy, 

especially making his dislike of 
Andrew known.

While Gary overcompensates 

in his efforts to make his 
importance to Selina known, 
Selina’s 
own 
quest 
for 

relevance, 
something 
that 

has evaded her throughout 
her career, is met with just as 
many obstacles. Seeing Selina 
fall in the previous season 
finale was heartbreaking, but 
watching her try to climb back 
up is made even more painful 
by her desperation to return 
to her former office. At times 
it’s funny, like when she sits 

behind the desk of the Oval 
Office replica in President 
Hugh’s 
new 
presidential 

library in the second episode, 
but at others it feels like a tired 
joke — especially as the stakes 
are much lower now (what’s 
left to pursue after losing the 
highest office in the nation?).

Outside of the White House, 

Selina’s 
relentless 
ambition 

feels 
more 
like 
unbridled 

desperation, and her comeback 
plot feels unfocused as the 
series quickly diffuses her 
efforts to start a foundation 
then shuts down the possibility 
of her presidential library.

While she tries to secure 

her legacy as president, Selina 
is relegated to an office in the 
South Bronx, where her new 
headquarters embody her sense 
of being discarded from the 
sphere of political influence. 
There, 
she 
argues 
with 

Catherine (Sarah Sutherland, 
“Shut Up and Drive”) over her 

late mother’s endowment and 
attempts to retain what little 
control she has by refusing to 
let Marjorie call her “mom.”

Though it’s all still funny, 

especially 
in 
the 
events 

following the season premiere 
— 
including 
Jonah’s 
failed 

attempt to woo his dates into 
the possibility of a relationship 
and the revelation of Andrew’s 
infidelity — there’s a touch 
of more despairing humor, 
possibly 
mirroring 
the 

dissatisfaction characterizing 
our nation currently. 

Despite the season’s initial 

struggle and lack of clear 
direction for Selina, it’s sharply 
written 
dialogue, 
well 
of 

Kennedy jokes and references 
to Selina’s constant failure find 
themselves right at home again 
in the new season.

‘Lonely’ quitely compels Reflecting on Michigan 

with Glee Club’s latest

For 
those 
aching 
with 

nostalgia for their cherished 
college 
days, 
for 
students 

finally 
seeing 
summer 

approaching and for those in 
a celebratory mood, the Men’s 
Glee Club Spring Concert at 
Hill will bring people in from 
all 
across 
the 
University’s 

expansive 
campus.

This Saturday, 

the Glee Club will 
be 
celebrating 

the 
state 
and 

University 
of 

Michigan 
as 
a 

part of the larger 
Bicentennial. It is 
a time to reflect 
on another year 
— and another 
century 
— 
of 

groundbreaking 
work.

“I think that 

the bicentennial is a really great 
opportunity to reflect on all 
the things that have occurred 
at the university in the past, 
and all the different ways the 
audience has engaged with 
the university,” said Glee Club 
President Patrick Kiessling. “I 
hope that our concert will help 
highlight those aspects as well 
as inspire people to keep doing 
these great things that we are 
celebrating.”

Casting their net over all 

of the Ann Arbor community, 
reaching 
anyone 
with 
the 

slightest 
affiliation 
to 
the 

University, the Glee Club will 
bring in a dynamic range of 
people for their celebration. 
Showcasing traditional songs 
of 
the 
University, 
songs 

featuring Michigan’s historic 
lumberjack industry, several 
original 
compositions 
by 

University students and faculty 
and songs that “evoke the 
beauty of both the University 
and state of Michigan,” the 
Glee Club will be showing 
their gratitude in the best way 
they know how.

“I hope that the audience 

comes 
away 
from 
the 

experience seeing how vital 
the U-M Men’s Glee Club is 
to the musical scene here at 

Michigan and being very proud 
of their own contributions and 
experiences here at U-M,” 
Kiessling said.

Following the True Blue 

concert by just one week, 
there is a palpable excitement 
surrounding the concert. After 
a successful premiere of “I Will 
Remember My Michigan” by 
alum William K. Brehm at the 
True Blue concert, anticipation 
runs high.

For 
those 

who missed the 
premiere of the 
new 
Michigan 

song, 
the 
Glee 

Club 
will 
be 

performing 
it 

again 
at 
their 

Spring 
Concert. 

For those keen 
on 
catching 

a 
premiere, 
a 

work 
composed 

by 
University 

of 
Michigan 

professor 
of 

composition, 

Kristin Kuster, may just fill 
that niche. A collaborative 
work with music written by 
Kristin 
Kuster 
and 
lyrics 

from 
Glee 
Club’s 
lyric 

submission contest, the piece 
explores different methods of 
composition.

“We 
had 
people 
submit 

lyrics, as long as they had 
any sort of affiliation with 
the University of Michigan 
whether they were a current 
student, an alumnus, a faculty 
member, retiree, we sent out a 
call for lyrics, we got a bunch 
and ended up doing a blind 
collection process,” Kiessling 
said.

With this contest, the Glee 

Club compiled the lyrics of 
an 
undergraduate 
student, 

a graduate student and an 
alumnus. While many of the 
works in the concert will 
appeal to the more traditional 
ear, 
those 
interested 
in 

exploring 
alternate 
music 

forms are bound to be satisfied 
as well.

The Glee Club will also 

perform 
more 
collaborative 

works 
from 
the 
collection 

“Searchlight Soul” by William 
Bolcom.

“Those 
pieces 
are 

particularly interesting in that 

they are works from 2009, and 
they’re set to texts by writers 
who were Michigan students 
at the time, so they’ve got 
some really interesting lyrics,” 
Kiessling added.

Kiessling 
stated 
that 

the concert will largely be 
“engaging with the state of 
Michigan’s history.”

“One of the things that I am 

really the most excited about 
is that we are doing a Motown 
medley, which is a little more 
contemporary than some of the 
pieces that we typically have in 
our repertoire, but it is just a 
lot of fun,” Kiessling said. “We 
have choreography, and some 
really well known songs that 
I am sure our audience will 
really identify with and really 
enjoy.” 

While Kiessling hopes to 

show “how vital the UM Men’s 
Glee Club is to the musical 
scene 
here 
at 
Michigan,” 

it is evident that the Glee 
Club works without borders, 
extending 
their 
influence 

across all of campus. With 
members of all different years 
and disciplines, the Men’s Glee 
Club serves as an icon for the 
University as a whole.

“We’ve 
got 
all 
different 

years, we’ve got grad students, 
freshmen, seniors and from 
all different schools as well. 
I’ve got friends in the business 
school, 
the 
architecture 

school, engineering, and the 
music school, but maybe I 
would have otherwise never 
met,” Kiessling said, reflecting 
on the effect that Glee Club has 
had on his friendships.

In an ensemble of students 

from all over the university, 
the Glee Club is creating ties 
all around campus, making 
a university with a student 
population of 44,718 feel united 
and just a little bit smaller.

With 19 different colleges 

consisting of undergraduate 
students, graduate students, 
faculty 
and 
staff, 
along 

with several local business 
affiliations, 
one 
common 

interest has the power to 
bring 
vastly 
diverse 
and 

extraordinary 
groups 
of 

people together. The Glee Club 
is just one of many that the 
University of Michigan has to 
commemorate.

Lovely Little Lonely is difficult 

to listen to while sitting still. 
It has the kind of undeniable 
pop rock vitality that demands 
movement 
and 

perpetual 
action. 

But 
what 
the 

album does best is 
rooted in its quiet 
components, such 
as 
the 
shorter, 

mostly instrumental interludes 
that 
“Lovely,” 
“Little” 
and 

“Lonely” 
deliver, 
and 
the 

intentional lulls in some of 
the more intense songs on the 
album. Formed in 2007, right at 
the cusp of the emo renaissance 
of the early 2000s, The Maine 
quickly rose to prominence 
alongside several of the “new 
wave” alternative rock bands 
that floated into being at the end 
of the 2000s. The sixth studio 
album the band has released, 
Lovely Little Lonely comes after 
2015’s slightly less pop oriented 
American Candy and has much 
of the same energy and balance 
that is characteristic of The 
Maine.

“Don’t Come Down” starts at a 

medium pace that quickly builds 
in intensity and complexity. 
With a vibrant, infectious spirit 
and bouncy instrumentals, the 
first track is equal parts pop 
and rock. Unlike more standard 
styles of alternative rock, the 
bass used in the track is light 
and almost weightless, which 
highlights the carefree sound of 
the piece rather than deepening 
and darkening it the way most 

rock basslines do. The lyrics 
themselves are relatively simple, 
which isn’t necessarily a bad 
thing: “When you are next to me 
and the music is loud / Singing 
‘Hey Nineteen’ somewhere in 
the crowd / We are up so high 
/ They can’t touch us now / We 

are 
thousands 

of feet from the 
ground” 
lead 

singer 
John 

O’Callaghan 
sings. 
“Don’t 

Come 
Down” 

makes great use of rhythm, 
using 
short, 
snappy 
lyrical 

passages that really power the 
piece.

“Bad Behavior,” the first 

single released from the album, 
has the same bouncing beat as 
“Don’t Come Down,” but the 
cheery sound of the song hides 
an 
underlying 
unhappiness. 

At multiple points, the lover 
is compared to a drug, adding 
a depth to the piece that 
distinguishes it from a typical 
love song: “Oh, I inhale you in 
small doses / But adore you like 
the roses / When you’re bad for 
me, yeah.”

Lovely Little Lonely is meant 

to be listened to in order, all the 
way through; it’s the only way 
to fully appreciate the graceful, 
seamless transitions that occur 
between tracks. “Bad Behavior” 
cumulates in a single, striking 
beat, then follows with hovering, 
wispy sounds before “Lovely” 
echoes into being. “Lovely” has 
a fluid, underwater soundscape, 
and is characterized by an 
intentional blurring that makes 
listeners feel as if they’re 
listening through a haze of fog. 

The lack of lyrics make for a 
pleasant, quieter break from 
the first two intense songs 
before transitioning into “Black 
Butterflies and Déjà Vu.”

“Black Butterflies and Déjà 

Vu” is by far one of the most 
memorable tracks on the album; 
it’s no wonder it was the second 
single to be released. Contrast 
plays a huge role in the song, 
and most of it centers around 
variations in how the chorus is 
sung: “I lose my voice when I 
look at you / Can’t make a noise 
though I’m trying to / Tell you 
all the right words / Waiting on 
the right words.” At times, the 
electronic instrumentals fall 
back and O’Callaghan’s voice 
becomes a tender croon, and 
at other times, his words are 
filled with a fiercely desperate 
longing.

The transition into “Little” 

is every bit as smooth as the 
ones that came before. Unlike 
“Lovely,” “Little” has a far 
more ghostly feeling, along 
with a whistling, eerie vocal 
overlay. Rather than completely 
stopping the flow of the album, 
“Little” makes listeners feel as 
if they’re suspended in time 
for a little bit; once again, the 
lull provides a nice pause, 
heightening 
the 
emotional 

impact of the songs both before 
and after. Ultimately, it’s the 
quiet calm of these passages 
that brings the album together 
as a cohesive whole; by giving 
space for the smooth and the 
intensity to complement one 
another, 
these 
sections 
fit 

together like a puzzle, and 
Lovely Little Lonely becomes 
one.

What to Watch For: Michigan football spring game

While 
the 
quarterback 

controversies of years’ past 
will get a break this go around, 
Michigan football coach Jim 
Harbaugh and his staff are 
tasked with the 
job of refilling 
nearly 
the 

entire 
offense 

and 
defense. 

Over the last 
few 
weeks, 

a 
handful 

of 
names 

have 
begun 

to 
separate 

themselves 
from the pack.

Those standout players will 

be revealed this Saturday, as the 
Michigan football team takes 
the field for its annual spring 
football game.

Harbaugh’s third spring game 

means his recruits are finally 
taking over the majority of the 
roster, and underclassmen will 
be called upon to fill many of the 
available voids this upcoming 
season. Players like sophomore 
defensive end Rashan Gary 
and freshman wide receiver 
Donovan Peoples-Jones are the 
spotlight names for a team that 
lost its “face of the program” 
player Jabrill Peppers.

The Maize and Blue teams 

go head to head on Saturday 
afternoon. Here’s what to watch 
for during the spring football game.

1. Try and keep up with 

Chris Evans

The 
days 
when 
former 

running back De’Veon Smith 
beasted, clawed and powered 
his ways through opponents’ 
front 
lines 
are 
long 
gone. 

Smith’s brusing style — and his 
superior pass blocking — will be 
sorely missed, but a new slate of 
tailbacks have emerged.

Leading 
the 
group 
is 

sophomore 
Chris 
Evans, 

who 
recently 
discussed 
his 

offseason 
progress 
after 
a 

strong freshman campaign. His 
speed became evident in the 
opening game of 2016, when he 
scored on two long touchdown 
runs against Hawaii. Evans 
has also mentioned his growth 
physically as he aims to boost 
his blocking abilities and also 
overpower opponents like his 
predecessor, Smith.

Evans 
shapes 
up 
to 
be 

Michigan’s go-to running back, 
after leading his position group 
in all but one category of testing 
at the team’s spring combine.

Other 
running 
back 

candidates to keep an eye on 
are redshirt freshman Kareem 
Walker, fifth year senior Ty 
Isaac and junior Karan Higdon.

2. Early enrollees getting in 

the mix

Another handful of open 

spots on Michigan’s offense are 
out wide. With the departure 
of Jehu Chesson and Amara 
Darboh — Michigan’s core wide 
receiving pair for the last two 
years — more starting spots 
have opened up. According to 
redshirt 
junior 
quarterback 

Wilton 
Speight, 
a 
pair 
of 

early-enrollees 
— 
Donovan 

Peoples-Jones and Tarik Black 
— have been making remarkable 
catches in practice and are in a 
position to earn serious playing 
time this fall.

People-Jones and Black will 

dress up in the maize and blue 
for the first time Saturday, 
and expect to see Speight and 
possible 
backup 
quarterback 

freshman Brandon Peters (more 
on that below) sending the ball 
in their direction.

Other receivers to note are 

sophomore 
Kekoa 
Crawford, 

senior Maurice Ways, senior 
Drake Harris and sophomore 
Eddie McDoom.

3. Meet and greet the new 

defense

Defensive coordinator Don 

Brown is a mean, angry dude. 
No wonder 10 of the 11 starters 
decided to leave.

Only 
fifth-year 
senior 

linebacker 
Mike 
McCray 

returns, and right in front of 
him will be four new starters 
on the defensive line. Expect 
to see sophomore Rashan Gary 
and senior Chase Winovich earn 
lots of playing time as defensive 
ends. In the middle at the 
defensive tackle positions, look 
for fifth-year senior Maurice 
Hurst and senior Bryan Mone.

Gary played in all 13 games as a 

freshman but did not start. With 
one sack and five tackles for loss 
last year, Gary is expected to 
pick up where former defensive 
ends Chris Wormley and Ryan 
Glasgow left off.

The back of the defense will 

feature a lot of new names, as 
well. The Wolverines have to 
replace their entire secondary. 
Thus far, sophomore cornerbacks 

Lavert Hill and David Long have 
gotten praise, while junior Tyree 
Kinnel and sophomore Josh 
Metellus appear to have locked 
up the safety spots. Meanwhile, 
at 
the 
hybrid 
VIPER 
spot, 

sophomores 
Khaleke 
Hudson 

and Jordan Glasgow will have 
the unenviable job of filling in for 
the now-departed Peppers.

4. Speight’s backup is…
Freshman 
quarterback 

Brandon 
Peters? 
Fifth-year 

senior John O’Korn? While 
former 
Wolverine 
Shane 

Morris announced his transfer 
earlier this year, O’Korn made 
his intentions clear — he was 
staying. Regardless, the starting 
quarterback spot is locked up. 
Speight led the Wolverines’ 
offensive unit last year, and 
plays an even more important 

role in 2017 as one of the few 
returning starters.

Unlike in the previous two 

years, there is no debate about 
who will start. The Morris-
or-Rudock 
and 
Speight-or-

O’Korn battles won’t repeat 
for a third time, but if Speight 
suffers another injury, as he 
did late in the regular season 
last year, someone may have 
to take over. Peters seems the 
likely candidate. The redshirt 
freshman will start for the 
Maize team this year — Speight 
is starting for the Blue team 
— and has clearly impressed 
the coaching staff in recent 
practices.

Bonus: Versatility
And just for fun, keep an eye 

out for Michigan’s potentially 
most 
versatile 
player 
since 

Jabrill Peppers.

Fifth-year 
senior 
holder 

Garrett Moores announced via 
Twitter that he will be playing 
for both the Maize and Blue 
teams at the spring game this 
year. Moores was the recipient 
of the Mortell Holder of the Year 
Award in 2016, and even ran for 
a two-point conversion against 
Rutgers last season.

The 2017 Michigan football 

spring game will feature new 
faces on all sides of the ball, 
but perhaps no position is more 
secure. Moores has his spot 
locked up better than anyone 
else does.

‘M’ downs Oklahoma
for first ranked win

If only looking at the hit 

column, it would seem that No. 
18 Oklahoma had done its job 
against the No. 13 Michigan 
baseball team. The Sooners held 
the Wolverines to just four hits, 
well below Michigan’s season 
average of 9.96 hits per game. 

However, the Wolverines (6-3 

Big Ten, 27-7 overall) found other 
ways to manufacture runs in 
their 5-2 win against Oklahoma 
(5-4 Big Twelve, 27-10 overall).

“Well you got to look at the 

number of guys on base,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“Holding the zone and taking 
advantage of some mishaps by 
their starter – and their starter is 
a good pitcher. If we chased and 
did him some favors, he could 
have had a quality start today. We 
did a nice job of swinging at the 
right pitches or not swinging at 
the wrong ones.”

Headed into the matchup, the 

Wolverines knew they had their 
hands full, as Oklahoma ranks 
fourth in the country with 10.1 
strikeouts per game, sixth with 
6.95 hits allowed per nine innings 
and ninth with a 2.73 earned-run 
average.

“We like to say we treat every 

opponent the same, and we do,” 
said junior left-hander Oliver 
Jaskie. “When we play a good 
team we don’t do anything 
different, 
but 
everyone 
was 

definitely excited for this one, this 
was marked on our schedule.”

It’s easy to see why. The 

victory marked the first win 
against a ranked opponent for the 
Wolverines of the season.

After Jaskie pitched a one-

two-three top of the first inning, 
Michigan tallied zero hits in the 
bottom half of the inning.

Yet 
the 
Wolverines 
still 

managed to score three runs, on 
five walks and a hit batter.

Sophomore second baseman 

Ako Thomas started the inning 
off with a walk and proceeded to 
steal second. Lugbauer walked 
two at-bats later. Then, redshirt 

sophomore Miles Lewis walked 
and so did Jake Bivens – scoring 
Thomas. Senior designated hitter 
Nick Poirier was then hit by a 
pitch, scoring Lugbauer. And in 
the next at-bat, sophomore right 
fielder 
Jonathan 
Engelmann 

walked to drive home the third 
and final run of the inning.

The very next inning, the 

Sooners responded with two hits 
to produce a run of their own, 
making it 3-1.

Through the first four innings, 

Michigan 
could 
manufacture 

only one hit. Following a leadoff 
walk in the fifth by senior 
centerfielder Johnny Slater, the 
Wolverines earned their second 
hit on a home run to dead center 
by Lugbauer, pushing the lead 
to four. The homer marked 
Lugbauer’s tenth of the season.

Oklahoma showed some fight 

though. The next inning, first 
baseman Austin O’Brien hit a solo 
shot that cleared the elevated 
wall in left field, cutting the score 
to 5-2. But, that would be the last 
run of the game for the Sooners.

While Michigan finished the 

game with just four hits, they 
managed eight walks and a hit by 
pitch for 13 total base runners.

Jaskie also returned to his 

typical form following a subpar 
start last Friday against Illinois. 
In seven innings pitched, Jaskie 
allowed just two runs on five hits 
and struck out six, his fifth win of 
the season.

“His outing couldn’t have 

gone worse last Friday,” Bakich 
said. “And to be able to pitch 
seven (innings) and only give 
up two (runs) was exactly what 
we needed and a good bounce 
back for him as well. It speaks 
to his character. He’s a kid who 
is extremely well trained, very 
mentally tough.”

Getting the first win of the 

series may prove the difference 
for the remainder of the series.

“It’s 
like 
a 
postseason 

atmosphere,” 
Lugbauer 
said. 

“To get a big win like that on a 
(Thursday) night is just good for 
our confidence going into our 
next two games.”

Competition emerging in the backfield

Jay Harbaugh was almost 

1,300 miles away from Ann 
Arbor when he found out about 
his new job. 

At about 11 p.m. in Houston 

in January, Harbaugh was 
sitting in his hotel room when 
he received a phone call from 
his father, Jim. The elder 
Harbaugh delivered the news — 
Jay would be the new running 
backs coach next season.

While some might have been 

surprised by the decision given 
that the younger Harbaugh 
had never played or coached 
the position, Jay went to bed 
excited to take on a new role in 
his father’s program.

Between his time spent with 

the tight ends for the Michigan 
football team last year and 
with the quarterbacks for the 
NFL’s Baltimore Ravens a few 
years back — where his uncle, 
John, is the head coach — Jay 
seems equipped to handle the 
challenge.

“The 
way 
that 
coaching 

works is — if you’re doing it 
right — you’re kind of absorbing 
everything,” Harbaugh said. “… 
There’s a totality in coaching, 
whether it’s offense or defense, 
of seeing the big picture.”

In 
his 
experience, 

quarterbacks focus on pass 
protections and tight ends 
focus on route running and 
run game blocking, so the main 
difference with running backs 
is carrying the ball — a skill 
Michigan’s talented backfield 
crop 
already 
possesses 
in 

spades.

Though they must recover 

from the loss of senior De’Veon 
Smith, the Wolverines still 
return key contributors from 
last season’s squad, namely 
rising sophomore Chris Evans, 
junior Karan Higdon and fifth-
year senior Ty Isaac.

The trio combined for 1,495 

yards on 234 carries with 15 
touchdowns 
while 
splitting 

time behind Smith. Clearly the 
feature back, Smith gained 901 
yards on 181 carries and scored 
10 touchdowns on his own. 

Without a clear number one 

this season, Evans, Higdon and 
Isaac all have an opportunity 
to emerge as major facets of 
Michigan’s run game.

“You’d like to be able to trust 

your whole group,” Harbaugh 
said 
after 
spring 
practice 

Thursday. “I’ve never liked 
thinking about running backs 
like that, assuming that two 
or three guys aren’t going to 
be good. I want everyone to be 
good.”

Added Higdon: “I definitely 

think 
we’ll 
have 
multiple 

guys 
in 
there, 
considering 

everybody brings something 
different and every guy is 
different and can attack the 
game in different ways. We’ve 
got a lot of weapons, so it’ll be 
fun.”

While all three will likely 

earn their fair share of playing 
time, that doesn’t mean they 
aren’t fighting for carries.

Just 
like 
at 
seemingly 

every other position for the 
Wolverines this year, Evans, 
Higdon and Isaac have been 
locked in a tight battle over the 
course of spring camp. That 

spirit of competition has been 
exemplified by the posting of 
depth charts in the meeting 
room 
of 
each 
respective 

position group.

These depth charts shed 

light on both the good and 
bad areas of each player’s 
performance 
in 
comparison 

to 
his 
teammates. 
Listing 

dropped 
balls 
and 
missed 

assignments as much as yards 
and carries, these depth charts 
serve the purpose of keeping 
Michigan on its toes.

“It’s a meritocracy around 

here, so it just makes sense 
for everyone to understand 
and to have it out in the open,” 
Harbaugh said.

More than just a simple 

motivational tool, the depth 
charts 
amp 
up 
the 
level 

of 
intensity 
between 
the 

Wolverines, who understand 
how much effort they have to 
put in to bypass the players 
ahead of them or maintain 
their edge over the players 
behind them. 

“It’s 
definitely 
a 
stiff 

competition,” 
Higdon 
said. 

“Each and every day, you gotta 

bring it. Each and every day, 
you see someone do something 
that makes you go, ‘Wow.’ ”

Added Isaac: “I’m going into 

practice every day trying to 
be the starter. If you’re ahead 
of me, I’m trying to beat you 
out. If you’re behind me, I’m 
trying to put some distance in 
between us.”

The way Harbaugh sees it, the 

spring game will be a turning 
point 
in 
the 
competition 

between his trio of backs. 
Besides quarterback, running 
back is the one position where 
the tempo of live competition 
can make a sizable difference 
in the relative performance of 
a player.

Isaac, part of the Maize team, 

and Evans and Higdon, members 
of the Blue team, will face off 
head-to-head with the chance 
to separate themselves in the 
competition. Saturday, any one 
of them could take the first step 
toward earning more playing 
time on Saturdays in the fall.

“It starts now,” Higdon said. 

“Spring is what sets you up for 
the fall. Spring is where you 
make your statement.”

Michigan running backs coach Jay Harbaugh is hoping to use every running back at his disposal through 2017.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Unwanted, unconventional and unrelenting

NCAA 
Division 
I 
football 

programs 
can 
give 
just 
85 

scholarships per year.

Those 
85 
recipients 
are 

considered the lucky ones. They’ll 
receive a free education, provided 
they stick it out long enough, and 
they’ll also receive stipends that can 
ease the burden that comes with 
being a student-athlete.

That scholarship is also sign 

of status. It means that player 
was wanted. It means that player 
didn’t just receive the customary 
letters detailing interest, but that 
they were wooed by the coaching 
staff — perhaps even invited on an 
all-expenses-paid official visit. It 
means that player was seen as part 
of the future of the program — that 
hopefully one day, they would play 
a crucial role for a winning football 
team.

Michael 
Wroblewski 
didn’t 

receive any scholarships coming out 
of high school. He was never invited 
on any official visits. He didn’t even 
have the guarantee of a spot on the 
roster that some non-scholarship 
players — deemed “preferred walk-
ons” — are given.

Yet, on Saturday, Wroblewski 

will run onto the field at Michigan 
Stadium for his final spring game, 
four years after his first as a member 
of the Michigan football team.

Now entering his final year and 

on a full scholarship, he is expected 
to be one of the leaders of a defense 
littered with young but talented 
players — nearly all of whom were 
highly-touted 
prospects 
offered 

scholarships by either the current 
or previous coaching staff.

Wroblewski was not one of those 

prospects. He took the less-traveled 
path.

When Wroblewski arrived in 

Ann Arbor, all he had was a lifelong 
affinity for the Wolverines, his 
conviction and the opportunity of a 
general tryout.

As it turned out, that was enough.
It didn’t take long for the 

Wroblewski family to instill a 
passion for Michigan football in 
their son. His father, Mike, bought 
him a winged helmet from a garage 
sale when he was just three years 
old. It hardly fit Wroblewski. But 
the budding young athlete insisted 
on carrying it with him everywhere 
— even wearing it for pictures.

During the fall, the family would 

drive to his great-grandmother’s 
house by Lake St. Clair on the 
weekends to pick grapes and make 
wine while listening to Michigan 
football games on the radio.

So Wroblewski quickly grew to 

love football and the Wolverines. 
He convinced his parents to sign 
him up for flag football, where he 
got his first taste of playing the 
sport.

He began playing other sports, 

too: basketball, baseball, soccer — 
anything he could get his hands on.

Football, though, remained his 

primary focus. His goal had been — 
and always would be — to play it at 
Michigan.

Even when he became one of 

the better players in the state after 
arriving at the University of Detroit 
Jesuit, that didn’t change.

By Wroblewski’s junior and 

senior year, he had achieved All-
American status in lacrosse and 

was one of the most decorated 
players to ever emerge from the 
program. It was around then that 
he began fielding overtures from 
the Michigan lacrosse team, as well 
as hearing interest from several 
Division II and III football teams.

The only problem was that 

Wroblewski 
had 
no 
interest 

in listening to anyone besides 
Michigan 
— 
to 
the 
slight 

consternation of his parents.

“It was kinda funny because 

I couldn’t believe there were no 
offers coming in, so I had talked to 
the athletic director, and I asked 
him, ‘Nobody’s interested in him for 
playing football?’ 
” 
said 
Laura 

Wroblewski, his 
mother. “And he 
said, ‘Oh yeah, we 
can get offers, but 
Michael said if it 
wasn’t Michigan, 
he didn’t want 
to entertain any 
of them.’ And I 
was furious! I 
thought, you’ve got to at least hear 
what they have to say!”

Added Mike: “He had finally said, 

‘I like lacrosse, but I love football. 
I’d rather play in front of 100,000 
people than 1,000 people.’ ”

Yet there remained zero contact 

between 
Wroblewski 
and 
the 

coaching staff he really wanted to 
hear from, then led by former head 
coach Brady Hoke.

His high school team’s on-field 

struggles may not have helped 
matters, either — Detroit Jesuit’s 
football coach resigned the summer 
leading up to Wroblewski’s senior 
season, and despite Wroblewski’s 
best efforts (he played both ways 
at running back and linebacker), 
the team struggled against a loaded 
schedule and finished 2-7.

“Mike was everything to us,” 

said Nick Kocsis, Wroblewski’s 
athletic 
director 
and 
football 

coach at Detroit Jesuit. “He’s just a 
throwback, gritty, blue-collar, tough 
kid, who happens to be — from what 
I remember — a brilliant student.

“We used to joke because he 

was so aggressive and so big and 
physical, we used to kid him that 
one day he was going to end up 
being a doctor and save one of our 
lives, but we’d be scared to death 
to see him in that room because of 
the way he acted on the football and 
lacrosse field.”

His high school career was over, 

and Wroblewski had yet to receive a 

modicum of interest 
from Michigan. The 
other 
options 
— 

lacrosse or playing 
at a lower level — 
had dried up, too, 
after the programs 
figured Wroblewski 
wouldn’t 
budge 

from his plan.

Only one door 

remained: 
attend 

the university as a normal student 
and make the team through tryouts.

“I 
knew 
I 
could 
do 
it 

academically, but I was really 
coming 
here 
for 
football,” 

Wroblewski said. “I didn’t even 
think about (a backup plan). I just 
had the one mindset of ‘I’m going to 
do this,’ and no plan B.”

He spent the rest of his senior 

year grinding through nightly 
three-hour workouts. Most didn’t 
know what he was up to — after 
coming across several naysayers, 
Wroblewski had stuck to confiding 
his plan with just his parents and a 
few close friends.

In the fall, he stepped foot 

on campus with the rest of the 
general student body as yet another 
nondescript freshman enrolled in 
the College of Literature, Science, 

and the Arts.

Then 
came 
the 
tryout 
— 

essentially what he had spent most 
of his life preparing for.

Wroblewski had no way of 

knowing in real-time whether 
he was impressing the coaching 
staff enough to earn a spot. He 
was confident afterward that he 
performed well, but then came a 
period when he didn’t hear back 
from anyone.

“He was nervous, but he was 

trying to be confident like, ‘I gave 
everything I could on that field,’ 
” Laura said. “So he never said he 
was worried they wouldn’t pick 
him, 
(but) 
we 

could 
just 
tell 

that 
he 
was 

worried 
about 

it because we’d 
ask him, ‘Did you 
hear 
anything? 

Did 
you 
hear 

anything?’ 
and 

he’d 
say, 
‘No, 

no, but I’m sure 
I will.’ He was 
confident within himself, but still a 
little nervous.”

After 
a 
long 
two 
weeks, 

Wroblewski received a phone call. 
He picked up, and a voice asked if 
he wanted to play for the Michigan 
football team. 

His parents had an inkling of 

what had happened when they 
received a call from their son.

“Whenever he wants to have 

us on speakerphone, we know it’s 
usually something pretty good — 
or bad,” Mike said. “But this time 
it was, ‘Yeah, I’ve got some good 
news.’ ”

Added Laura: “The first (call) 

when he made the team, that one 
totally made us cry because it’s your 
kid achieving his dream at such a 
young age. This was his lifelong 
dream, and he made the team. It 
was almost surreal.”

Wroblewski had dreamed of 

making the team for much of 
his life. His next two goals — of 
earning a scholarship and finding 
playing time amongst a talented 
and experienced linebacking corps 
— would take longer to come to 
fruition.

Two years later, his parents were 

on the other end of a much more 
unpleasant phone call.

It was the spring entering what 

would have been his redshirt 
sophomore season, and Wroblewski 
was participating in a fullback-
running back position drill. He was 
tackled, and his left knee twisted 
the wrong way.

Wroblewski told them he was 

walking into the hospital and said 
he was going for an MRI because 
his knee didn’t feel right. Then he 
said he couldn’t talk anymore, and 
hung up.

It took some time for the swelling 

to 
subside 
before 
Wroblewski 

returned to the hospital, this time 
with his parents.

The diagnosis was as feared: 

a torn ACL, one of the more 
catastrophic injuries a football 
player can suffer. It is an injury that, 
at the minimum, typically means a 
six-month recovery period.

Newly-hired head coach Jim 

Harbaugh, then in the midst of 
conducting his first spring practices, 
and Jim Minick, the associate 
athletic director for football, visited 
Wroblewski in the hospital while he 
recovered from surgery. Harbaugh 
told Wroblewski he really enjoyed 
having him on the team and that he 
liked his work ethic.

That conversation helped at 

first. But then a few days later, 
Wroblewski was on crutches back at 
home in St. Clair Shores, watching 
as his team played its spring game 
without him.

It was as if he was back to square 

one all over again.

“He didn’t say 

one word (during 
the game),” Laura 
recalled. 
“We 

didn’t say anything, 
either. It was just 
the hardest game 
to 
watch. 
And 

afterwards, 
he 

just went into his 
bedroom and shut 

the door. That broke our hearts.”

His parents helped take care 

of him for a few days before they 
drove him back to Ann Arbor. 
Football was a secondary concern 
at that point — simply reaching 
his bedroom on the second floor 
became an ordeal.

“It was very hard to just leave 

him there,” Laura said. “We took 
care of him after the surgery and 
then to just drop him off and be like, 
‘Well I hope you can get around,’ 
was just very hard. His story is 
inspirational but hasn’t always been 
all fun. To get so far and to tear 
that ACL and have to go back to the 
bottom of the list — it was just very 
heart-wrenching.”

Once 
again, 
Wroblewski’s 

parents were faced with the same 
uncertainty they had experienced 
when he went unrecruited by 
Michigan. They didn’t know how 
their son would physically recover 
from the injury, and they worried 
about how he would respond 
mentally, too.

It was only after several trips to 

Ann Arbor to check on Wroblewski 
that they realized everything — like 
before — would turn out okay.

“We would come and take him 

out to dinner, and we’d run into 
some of (his teammates’ parents) 
just walking around Ann Arbor,” 
Laura said. “These kids would come 
up to him and say (to us), ‘Your son 
is so good in that rehab room. All he 
does is try and pump us up, and he 
tries to get us all excited to work our 
hardest, to get back out there, to be 
our best.’

“As parents, that made us feel 

good. He didn’t make it all about 
himself. He was like, ‘We’re all 
going to get better, and we’re all 
going to get out on the field.’ ”

Wroblewski 
recovered 
fully 

from the injury. He remained with 
the team, working his way onto the 
depth chart as a MIKE linebacker. 
And then last year, during fall camp, 
Harbaugh called him into his office 
and said, “We’d like to put you on 
scholarship.”

Wroblewski is usually stoic. His 

parents said that themselves. But 
even he admitted feeling emotional 
during that meeting and during the 
subsequent phone call home.

After all, he had not only achieved 

his lifelong goal of playing for the 
team but also earned a mulligan 
on the recruiting process, proving 
himself worthy of a full scholarship 
nearly four years after the first 
go-around.

Things were going much more 

smoothly for him now.

Wroblewski went on to see his 

first-ever game action last season 
as part of the nation’s No. 1 defense, 
appearing in nine games and 
tallying four combined tackles.

Along with fifth-year senior Mike 

McCray and sophomore Devin 
Bush Jr., Wroblewski is expected 
to lead this year’s linebacking corps 
— due in part to his comprehensive 
knowledge of the defense, especially 
as a group of mostly inexperienced 
Wolverines 
continue 
to 
learn 

defensive coordinator Don Brown’s 
scheme.

“Wrobo helped me a lot last 

year,” Bush said. “He helped me a 
lot with the calls and understanding 
the defense. He was there when I 
needed him. If I was feeling out of 
place in the defense or I felt like I 
wasn’t getting things done, he was 
there to stay in my ear and tell me to 
keep pushing.”

Added 
Brown: 
“Mike 

Wroblewski is another guy that 
I’m watching in practice last year … 
can’t even believe it’s the same guy, 
you know? You talk about a self-
made football player. But a guy that 
knows it all. I’ve never had to do this 
before — he’s telling the secondary, 
making their on-rights and lefts 
call ... he’s making the tight call, 
he’s making the detach calls for the 
outside linebackers, and it’s finally 
like, ‘Hey Wrobo, you need to shut 
up and let those guys make those 
calls themselves.’ ‘Oh yeah, coach. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.’ That’s how well 
he knows the scheme.”

Wroblewski said it himself: It 

has been a long road — and the 
journey is still incomplete, with 
13 more games and the chance for 
a championship season looming 
several months ahead.

Yet no matter what happens 

during his final season, that journey 
will be looked upon as remarkable.

There are thousands of kids who 

hope to one day wear a winged 
helmet and touch the banner 
at midfield amidst a hundred 
thousand cheering fans.

There are much fewer who 

achieve that goal — and even fewer 
than that are the ones who do so 
after being passed over the first time 
around.

“It just speaks to his drive,” 

Kocsis said. “Mike’s done that all 
himself. It speaks to his work ethic, 
his ability and his ability to get the 
most out of what he has, because 
he’s excelled there beyond any 
expectations I would have have.

“That’s not selling him short. It’s 

that rare to be that kid. That kid who 
walks on and then ends up playing 
in nine games last year on a Big Ten 
(contender) and this year is looked 
at as a team leader.”

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Fifth-year senior linebacker Michael Wroblewski came to Ann Arbor as a regular member of the student body, but he turned his dream of playing for the Michigan football team into a reality.

“I didn’t even 
think about a 
backup plan.”

“It’s that rare 

to be that 

kid.”
