The sea of over 950 maize 

and blue chairs in the Diag 
and the ticker-tape sign above 
the Michigan Union’s doors 
are just two of the seven 
installations 
of 
Stumbling 

Blocks that will have students 
walking through history on 
campus for the next week. 

These pop-up art exhibits 
are 
scattered 
throughout 

Central, Medical and North 
Campuses and were created 
by 
the 
Future 
University 

Community to commemorate 
some challenging aspects of 
the University of Michigan’s 
history 
as 
part 
of 
the 

bicentennial celebration.

The exhibits are designed 

to 
attract 
attention 
to 

sensitive issues surrounding 

the University’s history that 
could otherwise be overlooked 
during 
the 
bicentennial 

celebration. 
These 
include: 

the Native American land 
gift of 1817 that served as 
a source of income for the 
University’s 
endowment, 

equity for women on campus, 
Proposal 2 — the state’s ban 
on race- and gender-based 
affirmative action — and 

Following weeks of activism 

and pressure on the part of Ann 
Arbor residents, City Council 
passed an ordinance Monday 
evening 
intended 
to 
protect 

undocumented 
residents 
from 

federal involvement. 

The Solicitation of Immigrant 

Status ordinance, which prevents 
local police and city officials from 
asking residents about immigration 
status, passed with an 8-1 vote, 
with only Councilmember Jane 
Lumm (I¬¬¬–Ward 2) opposing 
the ordinance.

The ordinance was originally 

crafted in response to President 
Donald Trump’s executive order, 
signed in January, that aimed 
to cut funding for jurisdictions 
that 
do 
not 
cooperate 
with 

federal agencies in identifying 
and 
detaining 
undocumented 

immigrants. The city was urged by 
residents over phone, email and in 
public hearings to support those in 
danger of deportation and to resist 
cooperation with federal agencies 
like the Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement agency.

The University sets up 950 empty maize and blue chairs as part of the President’s Bicentennial Colloquium movement 
Stumbling Blocks to help imagine minority students who did not attend the University after Affirmative Action was 
deemed unconstitutional at the Diag on Monday.

Q: You guys ran on a 
platform 
of 
diversity, 

having 
very 
specific 

experience 
with 
the 

ramifications 
of 
a 
lack 

of 
diversity 
can 
have 

on mental health. How 
do 
you 
see 
this 
play 

out over the course of 
your 
administration, 

particularly following this 
November 
presidential 

election?
David Schafer: To start, I’m 
just extraordinarily proud 
of the strides that we’ve 
made in working to ensure 
that CSG (Central Student 
Government) 
is 
more 

inclusive and representative 
of the student body. We 
commissioned 
the 
first-

ever demographic report in 
September, which showed 
how much work we really 
needed to commit ourselves 
to in the future.

I think it’s a commitment 

that 
all 
future 
CSG 

administrations 
need 

to make, as well as the 
University 
(of 
Michigan) 

administration to enhancing 
the diversity of our school 
as well as the inclusivity 
and equitability. I think a 
public 
college 
education 

is 
the 
best 
vehicle 
for 

personal 
and 
professional 

advancement in the world 
and everyone deserves an 
equal opportunity to realize 
the ability to achieve a 
college degree and a college 
education.

And 
I 
think 
it’s 
the 

responsibility 
for 
each 

and every member of the 
Michigan 
community, 

regardless 
of 
what 
our 

identities are and what our 
background is to stand up in 
support for each and every 
member of our community. 
And to never forget that an 
offense against one is an 
offense against all.

Q: One thing I want to talk 
about is the Bystander 
Intervention 
Training 

through 
SAPAC 
(Sexual 

Assault 
Prevention 
and 

Awareness 
Center), 
I 

just want to know, so you 
planned this for leaders 

seeking funding of — I 
believe — over $1,000, so 
what were the concrete 
benefits you’ve seen so far?
Schafer: I am so unbelievably 
proud of the work of everyone 
involved in the Bystander 
Intervention 
Training 

policy. I think special credit 
and honor is deserved to 
the folks at the SAPAC 
Bystander Intervention and 
Community 
Engagement 

Cohort 
Program, 
folks 

in 
Wolverine 
Wellness, 

specifically PULSE, all of 
SOFC (Student Organization 
Funding Commission), the 
Student Health and Safety 
Commission 
within 
CSG 

and all of the members who 
volunteered their time and 
gave their energies and deeply 
believed in this program and 
helped the staff throughout 
this 
past 
semester, 
and 

it 
personally 
exceeded 

my 
wildest 
expectations 

about how successful and 
impactful it would be. We 
reached 
more 
than 
315 

students from more than 205 
student organizations across 
the 
campus 
community, 

many of whom had never 
gone 
through 
a 
SAPAC 

or 
Wolverine 
Wellness 

training 
around 
sexual 

violence prevention, around 
mitigation of alcohol and 
other drug hard reduction 
and general risk.

Being a student leader at 

the University of Michigan 
is a responsibility and it’s a 
privilege and we need to set 
the example for every student 
on this campus, especially 
younger students, right? The 
way in which we act, in many 
ways will guide their future 
at Michigan and will either 
inspire them or will turn 
them off, so this training 
imparted to a lot of student 
leaders the importance of 
their role and the importance 
of serving as good role 
models to every member of 
the Michigan community, 
as well as the importance of 
relaying information about 
consent 
education, 
about 

best policies and practices 
to reduce alcohol and other 
drug risk to members of their

Edward Cho accepts Golden Apple
with lecture on benefits of passion 

MATT VAILLIENCOURT/Daily

LSA professor Edward Cho gives a lecture titled, “The Unexpected Benefits of Pain, Passion, and Pets” before he is awarded the Golden Apple Award at Rackham on 
Monday.

Economics professor also discusses relationship with cat, chronic illness and teaching

As the winner of the Golden 

Apple Award, an award given 
to one outstanding University 
of 
Michigan 
professor 
each 

year, Economics Prof. Edward 
Cho took the stage of Rackham 
Auditorium on Monday night to 
tell a crowd of adoring students 
and community members about 
his upbringing, his struggle 
with a repetitive strain injury 
and his legendary cat, Munchy.

The award, which is the 

only student-selected teaching 
award at the University, is in its 
27th year. Every professor who 
receives the distinction gets 
the opportunity to give a “last 
lecture” — their ideal class.

According to LSA senior Allisa 

Newman, one of the co-chairs of 
the award committee, the award 
is inspired by the teachings of 
Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrkanos, 
and celebrates teachers who 
give every lecture like it’s their 
final one.

“It’s based on an old teaching 

from the Rabbi … he advocated 
that you should get your life in 
order one day before you die, and 
this is for outstanding teachers 
who teach every lecture like it 
was their last,” Newman said.

The audience was made up 

largely of Cho’s students, like 
LSA senior Sindhu Devineni, 
who wanted to hear more about 
his life — and his cat.

“He has such a great energy 

that I really felt compelled to 
come,” Devineni said. “I just 
really want to hear more about 
his positive outlook on life. And 

he’s going to talk about his cat, 
Munchy, and she’s his world, so 
that’s really the highlight for a 
lot of people.”

Cho found out he had won 

the award when the committee 
burst into his Economics 102 
lecture in March. He said before 
Monday’s lecture that the reality 
of the award didn’t sink in until 
a few days later, but he had put 
a lot of thought into what to say 
since then.

“It didn’t really hit me until 

a few days later,” Cho said. “At

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

addressed students concerns 
about 
commencement, 

President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

proposed 
budget 
cuts 
to 

research 
funding, 
the 

reorganization of Michigan 
Medicine — formerly known 
as the University of Michigan 
Health System — and Medical 
School 
integration 
at 
the 

Monday meeting of the Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University 
Affairs. 
During 

their weekly meeting, SACUA 
also approved Robert Ortega, 
an 
associate 
professor 
of 

social 
work 
and 
current 

SACUA member, to replace 
current Chair Bill Schultz, 
a professor of mechanical 

engineering, next year.

Schlissel 
clarified 
the 

plans for the bicentennial 
commencement 
ceremony, 

specifically the choice not 
to have an outside speaker, 
which has sparked negative 
reactions from students. He 
cited recent commencement 
speakers 
like 
Michael 

Bloomberg, 
who 
was 

criticized for his discussion 
of safe spaces and trigger 
warnings, and the founders 
of Zingerman’s, who some 
students 
considered 
not 

sufficiently “prominent” to 
speak at commencement, to 
show how controversy over 
commencement is an annual 
occurrence.

“I point this out to say 

it’s 
always 
controversial,” 

Schlissel 
said. 
“In 
this 

particularly 
politically 

polarizing era, it would have 

been 
very 
challenging 
to 

find anybody in the political 
domain because everybody 
offends somebody these days 
in politics. We’ll go back to 
having speakers in subsequent 
years’ graduations, but for 
this one time, we decided to 
do something different.” 

He acknowledged student 

complaints that their voices 
were not heard during the 
decision 
process, 
but 
he 

emphasized the efforts of 
the University to make the 
bicentennial commencement 
unique. 

“I heard them, but I didn’t 

obey, 
in 
effect,” 
Schlissel 

said of student voices. “I 
think that’s healthy, I think 
the student voice is always 
important, 
it’s 
always 

welcome, but I think it’s 
misleading to think that it’s 
always determinative.”

Despite 
the 
student 

body pushback, Schlissel 
emphasized his belief that 
commencement will still 
be memorable for all those 
who are graduating.

“We’re stepping away 

from tradition for the sake 
of making this a special 
graduation,” Schlissel said. 
“I’m confident it’s going to 
be great.”

Schlissel also discussed 

the University response 
to the proposed “skinny 
budget,” 
which 
would 

potentially cut National 
Institutes 
of 
Health 

funding 
by 
20 
percent 

and materially impact the 
funding of research at the 
University. 

“We’re 
lobbying 
on 

this,” 
he 
said. 
“We’re 

reaching out to the people 
we have contacts with 
who 
understand 
the 

importance 
of 
research 

and the fact that it’s a long-
term investment, and we

Delta Airlines is holding 

a competition to provide a 

University of Michigan student 

a free flight to an educational 

opportunity abroad. The contest 

will close on May 12.

Students can apply with an 

essay answering the question, 

“Why should Delta assist with 

your pursuit of education 

abroad?”

The contest dictates 

applicants must be in one of the 

following programs: University 

of Michigan semester study 

abroad, summer study abroad, 

international internships and 

international volunteer or service 

programs. 

Since 2015, Delta has worked 

with nine other colleges along 

with Michigan, including 

Michigan State University, 

Penn State University and Duke 

University as part of their goals 

to connect with students, but 

they already had partnerships 

with Boston, GIT, University of 

Georgia, University of Minnesota, 

University of North Carolina and 

Syracuse. Other signs of Delta 

in campus life include career 

counseling and recruitment. 

Jeff Robertson, then 

vice president for product 

development, sky clubs and 

marketing communications at 

Delta, said in a 2015 press release 

Delta hopes to become a partner 

for college students in a tangible 

way instead of just spreading their 

brand. 

“College students are a savvy 

group of consumers,” Robertson 

said. “By creating campus and 

alumni events that incorporate 

our people, our unmatched focus 

on customer service, leadership 

and more, we will give students 

and alums the opportunity to 

really get to know our airline.”

University alum Catherine 

Doyle, who was interning at 

Delta at the time, said in the 

release she was hopeful about 

the relationship between the 

University and Delta.

“During this internship, it 

was clear that our campus insight 

was highly valued and it felt like 

we really contributed to Delta’s 

college engagement plans,” Doyle 

said. “I can’t wait to see all of 

hard work come to life on campus 

this fall.”

that moment it was kind of like 
what just happened? It was 
a complete surprise … (This 
lecture) is very personal, and 
I’m hoping students will be 
able to take something away 
from this that’s more than just 
classroom material.”

Cho started his lecture, titled 

“The 
Unexpected 
Benefits 

of Pain, Passion, and Pets,” 
like he begins his classes: by 
asking the audience to turn to 
their neighbors and introduce 
themselves. He then had the 
crowd practice his trademark 
classroom phrases — “Yuh” and 
“Nuh.”

When Cho said “Yuh!” into 

the microphone, the entire 
auditorium responded with a 
resounding “Yuh!”

After 
a 
short 
slideshow 

featuring pictures of his cat, 
Munchy, who Cho said was 
“basically 
his 
daughter,” 

he began talking about his 
upbringing 
on 
a 
farm 
in 

Cupertino, Calif. His parents 
both stopped formal education 
after junior high, and Cho 
grew up in a much lower 
socioeconomic 
bracket 
than 

most of his classmates. This led 
to insecurities later in life.

“Thinking 
back 
to 
high 

school, 
there’s 
a 
lot 
of 

insecurities,” Cho said. “The 
one that hit me the hardest, 
that I didn’t even realize until 
I wrote this speech — it was 
hidden in my brain almost — is 
probably the most pernicious 
one. It was, ‘do I have the 
ability, do I have the DNA, can 
I do this?’ … For those of you 
feeling the same self-doubt, 
the same ‘am I good enough?’, 
I want to tell you that you are. 
There’s nothing different about 
you.”

Cho did overcome those 

insecurities, 
and 
eventually 

found himself working toward 
a Ph.D. in economics from the 

Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 

Technology. 
The 
remainder 

of his lecture focused on his 
time in graduate school, and a 
story he said he hasn’t shared 
publicly before.

“Graduate school can be 

summarized for me in the 

simple 
equation, 
graduate 

school equals pain,” Cho said.

When he was in graduate 

school, Cho began to feel pain 
in his wrist. He would try to 
ignore it while he sat at the 
computer for hours a day, 
coding and organizing data for 
his dissertation. However, the 
pain didn’t go away. Instead, it 
began to spread.

“I kept going, I kept typing, 

and it started getting worse and 
worse,” he said. “I should have 
listened to my body. I didn’t. It 
started spreading all into my 
hand, all up this arm. It’s almost 
as if they did not belong to me, 
that my arms were someone 
else’s.”

Soon, the repetitive strain 

injury stopped Cho from being 
able to use his arms at all. 
Still determined to finish his 
Ph.D., he began to use voice 
recognition software to code 
the data, but eventually this 
wore out his throat as well.

“I never knew you could do 

that, that you could hurt your 
throat from talking too much,” 
he said. “This is definitely the 

most difficult part of my life. 
There’s two things happening: 
there’s so much pain in my 
throat that I just couldn’t talk 
anymore. I was mute. And my 
arms were shot … I remember 
having thoughts about cutting 
off my arms because they were 
the source of my pain … Pain 
warps your thinking.”

A year went by, and still 

Cho couldn’t use his voice. He 
didn’t know if he would ever 
get better, and he began to 
feel hopeless. At his darkest 
moment, he decided to turn 
to the animal shelter. This, he 
told the audience, was when he 
found Munchy.

“I 
thought, 
I’m 
like 
an 

animal, in the sense that I can’t 
talk, I can’t speak,” he said. “I 
can just run around and look at 
stuff. We’re the same.”

Like Cho, Munchy didn’t 

make noise. She would never 
meow, and the two spent their 
days staring at each other. 
Eventually, Cho began voice 
therapy and slowly regained the 
use of his voice. Miraculously, 
Munchy began to meow at the 
same time. Cho said this made 
him feel even closer to her.

Though the experience of 

his pain was difficult for Cho, 
he also counts it as one of the 
best things to happen to him, 
because it was what led him to 
teaching.

“It’s the best and worst 

thing that’s ever happened to 
me,” he said “Had I not sort 
of experienced all that pain, 
I probably wouldn’t be an 
educator. I probably would be 
in private industry somewhere, 
and maybe I’d have a different 
set of priorities. But after that, 
I could reorganize my life and 
my priorities, and in the end, it 
turned out that this story had a 
good ending.”

The evening ended when 

the Golden Apple committee 
presented him with the official 
Golden Apple Award. As they 
handed him the award, the 
entire audience gave Cho — and 
Munchy — a standing ovation.

can’t lurch from good funding 
to bad funding.”

At the mention of searching 

for 
alternative 
funding 

sources like the Food and 
Drug Administration, SACUA 
member 
David 
Smith, 
a 

professor of pharmaceutical 
science, said researchers at 
the University should strive 
to retain a high standard 
of research, even with the 
uncertainty of funding sources.

“We can fund ourselves and 

wind up being a very good 
mediocre 
school,” 
he 
said. 

“In no way would I encourage 
anyone to give up on NIH.”

Schlissel 
also 
spoke 

about the progress toward 
reorganizing 
Michigan 

Medicine as a cohesive unit.

“This 
reorganization, 

the goal of it is to make our 
health 
care 
delivery 
and 

academic enterprises a single 
enterprise so that their shared 
responsibility of all the leaders 
will be the success of both 
sides of that house in order to 
teach the research side, the 
clinical side,” he said. “The 
idea of bringing those two 
positions together and setting 
up a leadership group that work 
together on problems on both 
sides of the organization is to 
try to ensure that integration.”

Sami Malek, an associate 

professor of internal medicine 
and an upcoming member of 
SACUA, said, in his personal 
experience, he has found the 
University Medical School is in 
need of some sort of change.

“I think we’ve gone through 

the dark ages,” he said. “I just 
don’t think they had what it 
took to run such a thing on a 
competitive level. I think we 
all have to make sure things 
get better because it wasn’t 
good.”

At the end of the meeting, 

Schultz 
asked 
for 
further 

nominations for both the chair 
and vice chair positions for the 
next academic year. Ortega, 
the only nomination for chair, 
won with acclamation and 
the election of vice chair was 
postponed to provide further 
opportunities for nominations.

Presidential 
Bicentennial 

Prof. Martha Jones, one of 
the coordinators of Stumbling 
Blocks exhibits, discussed the 
importance of commemorating 
these events.

“This 
project 
tries 
to 

bring the questions that the 
bicentennial raises out into 
the public light of the campus, 
beyond 
auditoriums 
and 

seminars and lecture halls 
to places like the Diag and 
the Michigan Union,” Jones 
said. “It also recalls difficult, 
challenging and complicated 
moments of our past so we can 
think better about the future.”

According 
to 
Jones, 

Stumbling Blocks was greatly 
influenced by a project by 
German artist Gunter Demnig 
called 
“Stolpersteine,” 
or 

Stumbling Stones. His project 
originated 
in 
Berlin 
and 

has now spread throughout 
Europe. Demnig has removed 
cobblestones from sidewalks 
and 
streets 
and 
replaced 

them with brass plaques to 
memorialize the people who 
perished in the Holocaust.

“History is always there,” 

Jones said. “But it is often 
invisible or muted. By creating 
these 
installations, 
the 

invisible history can become 
more visible, and become a part 
of our contemporary memory.”

Five of the seven Stumbling 

Blocks were created by staff 
who have their own markers. 
The Fleming Administration 
building has been renamed, 
for the week, the “33,616 Staff 
Building,” in honor of the 
33,616 staffers who work for 
the University. 

Nearby, the sign in front 

of the Michigan Union ticks 

endlessly 
to 
demonstrate 

the restrictions on women’s 
use of the building from its 
construction in 1919 to 1968. 
The Union, according to the 
sign, was built as an exclusive 
men’s club, and women were 
required 
to 
enter 
through 

a side door and have a male 
escort 
accompanying 
them 

during specific hours and days. 
Equal access to the entirety of 
the building did not come until 
1968, when the Billiards Room 
allowed women entry.

A sign outside the exhibit 

displayed 
words 
from 

Michigan Union Director Amy 
White that progress can still 
made.

“We want all students to feel 

at home here,” the sign read. 
“To feel like this is their space. 
Our challenge — and that of the 
future university community 
— is to continue to evolve to 
meet the needs of students of 

all genders and identities.”

Many students and faculty 

had strong reactions to the 950 
empty maize and blue chairs in 
the Diag, which symbolize the 
number of underrepresented 
minority students who did not 
attend the University after 
Proposal 2 deemed race- and 
gender-based 
affirmative 

action unconstitutional in the 
state of Michigan. LSA senior 
Brian 
Sutherland 
discussed 

how he feels the chairs carried 
a sense of urgency.

“It captures the eye so 

quickly,” 
Sutherland 
said. 

“People think that an event is 
going to start, but once they 
see and read the signs they 
realize that this is actually 
has a deeper meaning to it … I 
definitely did not know about 
Proposal 2 before this.”

About 100 meters away, a 

plaque in Ingalls Mall that 
commemorates 
the 
Native 

American land gift to the 
University has been blown up to 
an 8-ft by 8-ft model with three 
sides and artificial lighting. 
According to Jones, this is 
so people will deliberately 
encounter the plaque and is 
meant to encourage them to 
have conversations about it.

“I was very inspired by a 

conversation with a colleague,” 
Jones said. “When I mentioned 
to them that we had a marker 
on Ingalls Mall, they exclaimed 
that they literally stumbled on 
it on their way to my office. So 
I thought that this idea that 
someone would accidentally 
or 
inadvertently 
encounter 

history seems like something 
we could work with.”

Encountering 
the 

monument, Music, Theatre & 
Dance junior Noah Kieserman 
commented 
how 
he 
felt 

enlarging these aspects of 
history has had a strong impact 
on conversations of diversity 
and inclusion.

“I think it’s important to 

make sure we remember the 
foundations of our University,” 
Kieserman 
said. 
“As 
well 

as 
continuing 
to 
support 

diversity and provide support 
for all groups and all walks 
of life at the University, I 
think it’s important to make 
everyone feel included. This is 
crucial especially during the 
bicentennial.”

Jones encourages students 

to Tweet using the hashtag 
#UMich200 to engage in the 
dialogue about the bicentennial 
and the University’s history.

But after that, I 
could reorganize 
my life and my 
priorities, and in 
the end, it turned 
out that this story 
had a good ending

Our challenge - 
and that of the 
future university 
community - is to 
continue to evolve 
to meet the needs 

of students

organizations 
and 
beyond. 

And I love to think of it like 
this: If we assume the average 
student 
organization 
has, 

let’s say 10 or 15 students, 
then this program impacted 
upwards of 3,000, if not more, 
students, and I think that’s an 
unbelievable accomplishment 
and something I deeply hope 
the next CSG administration 
will continue.

Q: 
You 
both 
endorsed 

eMerge, which was arguably 
the most experienced party, 
can you explain why that 
was a choice for you?
Micah Griggs: Well personally, 
I endorsed Anushka (Sarkar) 
and Nadine (Jawad) as the 
executive ticket because I 
felt that those two people 
would be the best for the 
organization, including their 
CSG experience. They’re well-
versed on a lot of issues on 
campus, they’re inclusive in 
their work and their speech 
and I think they will move the 
organization forward.
Schafer: I’ve just come to so 
deeply 
admire 
personally 

and professionally Anushka 
and Nadine. Both of them are 
some of my closest friends on 
campus and I’ve seen the work 
they’ve done and they’re two 
of the best change makers 
that I’ve ever met, not only 
in my time at Michigan, but 
throughout the course of my 
life. I know for certain, and 
I’m sure I speak on Micah’s 
behalf as well on this point, 
that 
Anushka 
and 
Nadine 

will never quit, especially 
when the going gets tough. I 
honestly meant it when I said 
that a vote for them was the 
best CSG-related vote that 
any student at this University 
would and could ever cast. 
And I’m extraordinarily proud 
of those two for the campaign 
they ran, the issues on which 
they ran, and I look forward 
to bearing witness, albeit from 
the sidelines, to the great work 
they’ll do next year

Q: 
The 
DEI 
(Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion) plan 
still isn’t favored strongly 

among 
members 
of 
the 

student body. As you are 
the main liaison with the 
administration, 
can 
you 

speak to student concerns 
that 
you’ve 
heard 
over 

the 
past 
year 
regarding 

ambiguities within the plan 
or any sort of things you’ve 
heard?
Schafer: I think one of the 
major questions that students 
have raised, at least from 
my eyes, is the timeline. I 
think some students have the 
perception that we’re waiting 
five years, or the University 
administration is waiting five 
years to implement everything, 
and I don’t believe that’s 
necessarily the case. I think, 
obviously, you have short-term 
initiatives and you have long-
term initiatives. Real change 
is hard and it takes time, but 
that’s not to say that students 
should not continue to hold the 
administration 
accountable, 

because they must, and they 
should.

Q: You guys advocated very 
strongly to get a student 
on the Board of Regents. 
There still isn’t a student 
on the board, so can you tell 
us a little about what that 
journey was like for you 
and what barriers you came 
across?
Schafer: 
Of 
course 
I’m 

disappointed it didn’t happen, 
but again, it’s a long-term 
initiative that takes time. So 
at the start of the year, with 
an indispensable foundation 
set 
by 
the 
previous 
CSG 

administration, we were able 
to push through an addition 
to the Regents’ bylaws, 701, 
that discusses the importance 
of student participation in 
University decision making, 
and 
guarantees 
that 
such 

participation will be sought 
and 
encouraged 
by 
key 

decision makers and other 
University 
administrators, 

including the Board of Regents. 
I 
think 
institutionalizing 

that language is something 
tangible 
that 
future 
CSG 

administrations 
can 
grasp 

and point to and say, ‘listen, 
students need to be involved 
in 
key 
decisions 
at 
the 

University.’ For example, we 
used that language to advocate 

for the inclusion of student 
presence 
on 
the 
provost 

search advisory committee. 
So to have that student is big 
because that’s a key University 
decision. Going forward, it 
is my continued hope that 
students work to strengthen 
student engagement with the 
Board of Regents because the 
Board of Regents is unique 
among its peers in the Big Ten 
and across the country for 
not having a student presence 
on the board.* So maybe if 
we had a little more time, but 
I’m proud of the groundwork 
and foundation we laid and I 
believe that it will happen one 
day.

Q: So we wanted to talk 
a 
little 
bit 
about 
the 

Leadership 
Engagement 

Scholarship. Some students 
raised concerns over the $5 
fee, and I just want to learn a 
little about your experience 
with them and a little about 
the process of going through 
the article and how will the 
scholarship move forward in 
the upcoming year?
Griggs: 
Well, 
firstly, 
the 

Leadership 
Engagement 

Scholarship 
was 
created 

to 
award 
emerging 
and 

established leaders on campus 
who face financial barriers to 
getting involved on campus 
and we’ve participated in a 
variety of efforts to increase 
funds for the scholarship. 
We’ve 
done 
outreach 
to 

donors and participated in 
Giving Blue Day, so we were 
thinking of other objectives 
and ways to increase funding 
and we did take the route of 
advocating for a student fee. 
We’ve decided to work with 
the administration to increase 
funding for the scholarship, so 
going forward we’ll be working 
with the administration to 
find ways to increase funding 
for the scholarship. We’ll still 
be participating in Giving Blue 
Day and doing outreach to 
alumni.
Schafer: For me, the leadership 
engagement 
scholarship 
is 

without a doubt the proudest 
thing I think we were able to 
accomplish this year. We’ve 
raised more than $180,000 
over the course of this year 
alone and that money, as well 

as the money yet to come from 
other alumni and donors, as 
well as, like Micah touched on, 
the administration, will better 
the lives of student leaders for 
generations to come, frankly 
for the life of this Michigan. 
And it’s just the belief that 
every student regardless of 
who they are and where they 
come from deserves the ability 
and the opportunity to have 
those same memories and to 
have those same Michigan 
experiences that so many of us 
have been afforded during our 
four plus years on campus.

Q: 
Also, 
we 
had 
the 

Student Support & Action 
Committee. They aim to 
work with bias response 
(the Bias Response Team) to 
promote positive messaging. 
I was just wondering how did 
it work out, what were the 
outcomes of this committee?
Schafer: The whole goal of 
that is obviously not to replace 
what the Dean of Students 
does because we’re incredibly 
thankful for the work of their 
office, from the Bias Response 
Team perspective, but really to 
help them. So the whole goal 
and impetus of this committee 
is, it’s maybe to address and 
to mitigate the impact of 
those harmful messages by 
spreading positive messages. 
I believe this is the case but I 
remember talking with senior 
administrators, both of us, 
after the racist and awful fliers 
were posted in September and 
October and they said ‘legally, 
we cannot remove the fliers.’ 
Students are not compelled 
or bound by the same legal 
obligations or restrictions that 
administrators are.

Q: 
After 
you 
graduate, 

how do you hope to stay 
connected to the University? 
Do you plan on still being 
involved with the campus?
Schafer: I think I’m going to 
maybe not come back for a 
few years. No, I don’t say that 
sadly, because as the old cliché 
quote goes, I think absence 
makes the heart grow fonder. 
My ultimate goal from this 
year is to best understand what 
this role and this position has 
given me and what I’ve learned 
from it. 

INTERVIEW
From Page 1

Jessica Prozinski, who is active 
in the organization Stop Trump 
Ann Arbor, said during the 
meeting. Prozinski was one of 
the supporters of the ordinance, 
and called on the city to do 
more as federal policies restrict 
undocumented 
individuals’ 

freedom.

“Our goal with this ordinance 

at this time is to give greater 
protection to the undocumented 
people in our community, to 
lessen the fear and to decrease 
the chances that people will be 
arrested for immigration related 
charges, detained and deported,” 
Prozinski said. “I think this 
ordinance does that.”

She went on to list other 

actions Stop Trump Ann Arbor 
wanted the city to take, including 
refusing 
to 
cooperate 
with 

federal agencies in arresting 
undocumented immigrants and 
refusing to arrest people based on 
administrative warrants.

A main point of concern for 

City Council in passing the 
ordinance was the risk of losing 
federal funding. As such, the 
ordinance currently does not 
explicitly defy any federal policy.

Lumm, who voted against 

it, stressed the importance of 
remaining in compliance with 
federal policy, and pushed for an 
amendment that explicitly called 
for compliance from employees 
of the city.

“I will not support something 

that places federal funding at 
risk and shifts the burden of 
paying for city priorities to local 
taxpayers,” Lumm said.

The council convened for a 

closed session to discuss the 
amendment, after which they 
deliberated publicly, eventually 
voting against it.

Councilmember Jack Eaton 

(D–Ward 4) argued the language 
from the amendment was vague, 
and made the work of city police 
and officials uncertain.

“This 
language 
actually 

creates uncertainty for our staff, 
as you’re telling them it’s not 
meant to cause a violation of a 
valid law,” Eaton said.

M

y 
name 
is 
Emily 

Kaufman. 
I 
am 

transgender, and this 

aspect of my identity is intrinsic 
to my sense of self. But I am 
more than that: I am a human, 
a woman, a friend, a leader, a 
writer and a poet.

In three separate instances, 

The Michigan Daily has either 
misrepresented or erased my 
identity. I want to start, however, 
with an example of accurate and 
honest reporting that I expect of 
the Daily. On Jan. 17, an article 
was written about being trans 
on campus that included a few 
quotes I provided during an 
interview. Other transgender 
people 
were 
included 
and 

interviewed, 
offering 
an 

array of opinions on the issue. 
LSA junior Grant Strobl, the 
infamous chairman of Young 
Americans for Freedom was 
mentioned, but not interviewed.

This is important to note 

because in a later article I was 
interviewed for, published on 
Feb. 23, Strobl was interviewed. 
This article was not about free 
speech, something championed 
by Strobl’s group. No, this was 
about transgender people in 
bathrooms, and seeing that 
Strobl is neither transgender 
nor a policy maker, I hardly 
see why his opinion is relevant. 
Should he wish to voice his 
opinion, he has that right, but 
for the Daily to purposefully 
seek out Strobl for an interview 
is not only offensive to me, 
but it adds to the narrative 
that transgender people need 
cisgender 
people 
to 
affirm 

their right to exist, when I and 
all transgender people do not 
need — nor do we want — that 
affirmation. I am here, I am 
trans and including narratives 
from people who do not respect 
my identity is disappointing 
and harmful.

An 
article 
published 
on 

Feb. 13 in regards to free 
speech also included a small 
portion from an interview I 
participated in. This article 
was many paragraphs long and 

contained only five lines from 
my interview, but included 
an in-depth interview with 
LSA junior Andrew Krieger, a 
member of the aforementioned 
Young Americans for Freedom, 
who invited the now-notorious 
Milo Yiannopoulos to speak 
in February 2016. I went to 
this event to try to be a voice 
against Yiannopoulos and to do 
my part to show that there were 
many people at the University 
of Michigan who didn’t want 
him there.

After hearing Yiannopoulos 

rant and rave about how rape 
culture is a myth, that third wave 
feminism is a travesty and that 
women were the true “privileged 
ones,” I waited in line, behind 
lots of men, to ask my question. 
I interrupted and asked him if 
he thought rape culture was a 
myth, how could he explain the 
Ke$ha situation. (For those who 
don’t remember, at the time, she 
was battling her former producer 
who raped and abused her, in 
court). Yiannopoulos went on 
to dismiss my claim and called 
me “sir.” He is one of the most 
vile people to roam this earth, 
and the Daily needs to be 
accountable when interviewing 
people who support his “right” 
to vilify and condemn people 
like me.

The final straw for me was 

when I performed in this year’s 
production 
of 
The 
Vagina 

Monologues. I wrote my own 
piece entitled “My Vagina,” in 
which I explained the process 
through which I got my gender 
reassignment surgery this past 
October. After the show, a Daily 
report sent me a Facebook 
message asking for my take 
on The Vagina Monologues. 
Instead of including a single 
word of my response, the 
author 
instead 
cited 
an 

audience member who said, “I 
really loved the transgender 
woman’s speech, and in general 
all of the ones that they wrote 
themselves 
were 
absolutely 

mind blowing — but hers in 
particular was really amazing.”

I am glad the student watching 

enjoyed my piece and she felt 
that it gave transgender women 
a voice, because indeed it did. I 
am upset because after asking 
for my take on the show, the 
author ignored me and instead 
cited another person’s view of 
me, and all I became was “the 
transgender woman.” There was, 
in fact, another girl like me in 
the show, and it is upsetting that 
people assumed I was the only 
girl assigned male at birth who 
performed. Because how could 
there be any other transgender 
women on campus?

I am constantly tokenized 

as the only trans woman in 
almost every space I occupy, 
and many of my trans sisters 
are not interviewed by the 
Daily five times a semester. I 
have the awesome burden of 
representing my community to 
the University community, and 
I cannot hope to share the vast 
array of voices trans-feminine 
people possess, but I feel that 
people look to me to see what 
transgender women are, when I 
am only one person.

I want the takeaway from 

my criticism to be this: Do not 
marginalize trans identities in 
articles published in the Daily. 
I would be happy to do future 
interviews, but I ask that I 
am covered by someone with 
experience on social justice 
issues so I can read some of 
their prior work to ensure I 
am 
accurately 
represented. 

Additionally, 
I 
would 
like 

confirmation that, if I am being 
interviewed for something so 
relevant to me, I am not a side 
note, but take up a fair portion 
of the article. As a frequent 
contributor to the Daily, I do 
not want trans voices to be 
marginalized — not again. We 
will never go back and I want 
everyone at the Daily to help 
me fight for trans liberation, 
instead of contributing to our 
seemingly perpetual existence 
in the shadows.

M

y therapist recently 
told me about the 
concept of FHBs — 

fallible human beings. We all are 
fallible. From myself to President 
Donald Trump, we’re 
all humans who will 
inevitably mess up.

This concept was 

originally shared with 
me because I’m usually 
hard on myself when I 
struggle or fail. I tend 
to be a perfectionist 
who wants to be the 
best to everyone, and 
I kick myself when I 
fall short. But I’ve also 
been trying to use this concept to 
accept my family and friends’ faults 
and resolve conflicts we may have 
with one another.

While it’s justified to be angry 

about disagreements, the quickest 
way to get past them is to accept 
the person as human. When a 
disagreement occurs, I try to 
remember that the person was 
doing their best in their own mind. 
On the other hand, it’s difficult for 
the person you’re quarreling with 
to miraculously have a change of 
heart or do something different 
before you state your displeasure. 
They can’t read your mind.

It’s very easy to blame someone 

over a disagreement when thinking 
about a scenario retrospectively. 
This is why it’s good to discuss 
personal disdain for a controversial 
choice after it’s made. But there’s 
a 
difference 
between 
having 

empathy while voicing concerns 
and not giving a person a second 
chance. Not everyone shares the 
same backgrounds, perspectives 
or thought processes. Opinions 

don’t change unless we have 
productive conversations.

At the same time, this does not 

mean refutes should be weak in 
nature. Refutes should be firm while 

recognizing 
everyone 

is fallible. We all mess 
up. However, I do think 
increased 
criticism 

is 
viable 
when 
the 

decisions an individual 
or group makes are 
routine instead of an 
isolated slip up.

The concept of the 

FHB can be applied to 
many situations. Before 
I engage with an issue, I 

take a deep breath and play devil’s 
advocate. How would I feel if I 
messed up something important? 
I’m sure I would feel terrible and 
would 
appreciate 
constructive 

criticism.

Without acknowledging our 

family and friends as fallible, our 
concerns will not be heard. People 
are much more likely to listen when 
you meet them at their level and try 
to understand their situation.

I’ve had conflicts with friends 

and family when I messed up. I’ve 
said things I didn’t mean to friends 
and I haven’t always supported 
my family as much as I would like 
to. I was at fault. I’m sure you can 
think of a time when you did the 
same. What I appreciated in those 
moments was some time to reflect 
after someone met me where I 
was at, by being firm in resolving 
our conflict, while being honest 
and loving. I was being seen as a 
human being.

There is a difference between 

forgiving loved ones and people 
in positions of power or influence, 

but that doesn’t make them any less 
human or less likely to mess up.

Across many issues, people are 

justified in their pain and desire for 
change in a person or issue. I’m also 
speaking somewhat from a position 
of privilege as a Black man, where 
I’m able to speak freely as a student 
without an enormous amount of 
ridicule. Other groups of people in the 
United States and across the globe are 
in situations where the circumstances 
are much more dire. This message of 
aspiring for reconciliation is not for 
them because it may not be attainable 
and is more complicated than just 
recognizing that people mess up every 
once in a while.

I’m 
also 
speaking 
from 
a 

perspective where my conflicts 
and concerns I have with my loved 
ones have been minor. Others have 
bonds that have been broken over 
much more severe circumstances. 
In those instances, it may be more 
difficult or even impossible to 
forgive, which is justified.

I just wonder what looking at 

everyone as FHBs would look like 
when there are disagreements. 
Would potential denial or rebuttal 
be less likely, or would a calm, 
reasonable demeanor not quite 
grab someone’s attention? I believe 
our bonds with the people we love 
could be improved in the present 
and future if both see each other as 
fallible. It may unlock a potential 
to resolve conflict that resides in 
the affected person’s mind and 
with others. Seeing people as 
fallible is freeing, personally and 
relationally. It’s a path to self-
esteem and decreased anxiety.

EMILY KAUFMAN | LETTER TO THE EDITOR

CHRIS

 CROWDER

Support 
for 
international 

students and faculty from university 
administrators across the state is 
urgently needed right now within a 
political landscape that encourages 
xenophobia. The University boasts 
a 
robust 
international 
student 

community, which accounts for 
about 15 percent of total student 
enrollment. Furthermore, 1,277 non-
immigrant international employees 
and 
533 
international 
visiting 

scholars worked on our campus last 
fall, contributing immensely to the 
University experience. When many 
international students and faculty 
may feel unsafe or marginalized 
because of travel ban restrictions, it is 
important for these administrators to 
voice their support for them. 

The op-ed highlights the value 

international students and faculty 
bring to these universities through 
their contributions both to research 
institutions 
and 
to 
Michigan’s 

economy. The university presidents 
cite that international students at 
their universities are almost as likely 
as domestic students to continue to 
work in Michigan post-graduation, 
stimulating the state economy by 
providing skilled work. Moreover, 
attracting an international faculty 
roster brings about economic benefits 

not just in research funding for the 
University, but also in the state as a 
whole. One example of a person who 
has brought economic prosperity 
to the state offered by the op-ed is 
Engineering Prof. Kamal Sarabandi, 
an Iranian immigrant. Sarabandi 
currently holds 14 U.S. patents and 
has brought $60 million to the Ann 
Arbor area by co-founding his first 
company, EMAG Technologies Inc.

Though the op-ed highlights 

the economic advantages of an 
international campus, it neglects 
to account for more immeasurable, 
humanistic 
value 
a 
diverse 

student body and faculty bring to 
the University. In our globalized 
society, experience working in 
internationally diverse communities 
is integral, as students will more 
likely than not interact on a global 
scale throughout their careers. 
Most students do not have exposure 
to 
international 
communities 

until coming to the University; 
the University must foster an 
environment 
where 
students 

are encouraged to engage across 
national lines.

Furthermore, nation of origin — 

while of course not the only factor 
influencing diversity — plays an 
essential role in contributing to the 

diversity on campus. International 
students help bring diversity to 
leadership roles when they engage in 
organizations and classrooms across 
campus, bring stronger advocacy of 
certain marginalized communities 
and contribute new ideas from 
different worldviews. International 
diversity in classrooms encourages 
nuanced thought on difficult issues 
and offers students many unique 
perspectives to learn from those who 
may have different life experiences. 
One program that fosters these 
ideals at the University is the Global 
Scholars Program, which is a living-
learning community that encourages 
the creation of globally-minded 
citizens. Without students from many 
countries, this kind of community 
learning would be impossible.

An 
internationally 
diverse 

campus community is valuable 
for the state economy as well as 
our University experience. The 
University and its administration 
should continue to support our 
international community. In times 
when our country’s stance on 
immigration and diversity is called 
into question, it is respectable to see 
that our school administrators still 
see the value in an internationally 
diverse campus.

FROM THE DAILY

Stand by our international campus
A 

t the end of March, Mark Schlissel, Lou Anna Simon and M. Roy Wilson, 
presidents of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and 
Wayne State University, respectively, co-wrote an op-ed arguing the 

three universities better serve society because there are international students 
and faculty who study and work on their campuses. Though there is always more 
to be done, this op-ed sends a strong message of solidarity with our international 
community, which contributes to our campus not only through the economic 
contributions described in the op-ed, but also through contributions to 
diversity on campus. It is Schlissel’s job to advocate for the best interests of 
the University community, especially in the midst of a federal administration 
that promotes nationalistic values. The Michigan Daily’s Editorial Board 
commends Schlissel’s outspoken support for the international community.

I

n high school, no one 
took me seriously. This 
may sound bitter, angry, 

perhaps even petty, 
but it was true. I 
was 
a 
bright-eyed 

and 
bushy-tailed 

teenager. 
I 
came 

to 
school 
(almost) 

every day with an 
overtly 
positive 

disposition. I took 
AP classes and spent 
hours longer than 
required at school, 
deep in the throes of 
student council or drama club 
or marching band practices. I 
loved every moment, and I was 
unwaveringly happy. But no 
matter how hard I tried, I was 
very, very rarely taken seriously. 

For one, being inherently 

optimistic and pleasant does 
not predispose one to be seen 
as academic. As well as I did 
in my classes, my scores meant 
nothing to my peers who saw 
me as too sunny and cheerful to 
be considered an “intellectual.” 
I 
was 
girly, 
happy 
and 

curious, and these traits were 
perceived as conflicting with 
intellectualism. 
Having 
an 

affinity for young adult novels 
or “unrefined” television shows 
were 
deemed 
incompatible 

with 
high-brow 
academia. 

Even things I couldn’t change, 
such as my body or my voice, 
defined how others perceived 
me. Clothes worn by other 
girls without comment were 
viewed as inappropriate on my 
frame. Year after year I was 
conditioned, like so many other 
young women, into believing 
my body was shameful and 
hypersexual, something to be 
covered and hidden away.

My community is perhaps 

outdated in its views, but that 
is by no means uncommon. The 
University of Michigan is a far 
more 
accepting 
community, 

and I am no longer so negatively 
perceived 
on 
the 
basis 
of 

being feminine or optimistic. 
However, our perceptions are 
no clearer or less vindictive 
than the perceptions of my 

“outdated” community. While I 
may no longer be as negatively 
perceived 
on 
the 
basis 
of 

my 
appearance, 

many 
identities 

at 
this 
university 

continue 
to 
face 

harsh judgment and 
criticism on the basis 
of their image.

For 
centuries, 

modes 
of 
gender 

presentation 
have 

been 
incredibly 

particular. 
Though 

we’ve 
progressed 

from corsets and waistcoats to 
Canada Goose and athleisure, 
the 
ways 
humans 
choose 

to present themselves have 
been influenced heavily by 
how 
others 
perceive 
these 

presentations. Consider how 
you would perceive someone 
dressed 
in 
chainmail 
at 

a 
Renaissance 
festival 
as 

opposed to shopping for deli 
meat at Meijer. Your perception 
of this person would be deeply 
influenced by their apparel, 
appearance, gender, age and, 
importantly, the context in 
which they appear.

For some, perception and 

judgment are not as influential 
into 
their 
presentational 

decision making. Some are 
content to present themselves 
as they please, regardless of 
judgment or perception; yet for 
most women, this disregard for 
appearance seems improbable 
and unattainable.

For 
women, 
particularly 

women of color, non-gender-
conforming 
individuals 
and 

individuals passing as women, 
presentation 
is 
incredibly 

important. Women in male-
dominated 
fields 
often 
feel 

compelled to downplay their 
femininity to be successful. Men 
are able to feel more comfortable 
in 
fields 
such 
as 
medicine 

or 
computer 
science, 
where 

appearance is viewed as unrelated 
to the technical work being done. 
The field of business comes with 
its own dress codes and policies, 
some requiring women to wear 
high heels and makeup.

These struggles are only 

exacerbated 
when 
another 

identity, such as race, ability 
or 
sexual 
orientation, 
is 

considered. This topic was 
discussed in an early episode of 
the show “Insecure,” created 
by Issa Rae. On the show, 
Molly, a young, successful, 
Black lawyer is introduced 
to a new summer associate 
at her firm. The associate, 
also a young Black woman, 
is depicted as confident and 
loud, and Molly is asked by 
a senior associate to tell the 
young woman to tone it down. 
Not only must these women 
grapple with being women in 
a male-dominated field, but 
they also must navigate their 
field 
as 
racial 
minorities, 

taking care to avoid racial 
stereotypes. The perceptions 
of 
their 
coworkers 
almost 

entirely dictate their choices in 
appearance and portrayal.

I am lucky to be able to 

express myself as I please 
without major consequences, 
though I dread the near future 
when 
professionalism 
will 

trump (or restrict) my creative 
expression. Others are not so 
lucky. As liberal and open-
minded 
as 
our 
University 

claims 
to 
be, 
perceptions 

tainted 
by 
prejudice 
are 

still 
incredibly 
pervasive. 

The age-old idiom of “don’t 
judge a book by its cover” 
remains applicable, and our 
motivations to maintain a 
particular 
appearance 
are 

still influenced by a fear of 
judgment. Not all judgments 
on the basis of appearance are 
unethical or unreasonable.

Consider your perceptions 

of 
others 
and 
instead 
of 

reprimanding yourself when 
you judge another person on 
the basis of their appearance, 
ask 
yourself, 
“Why 
do 
I 

associate ‘x’ appearance with 
‘y’ personality trait? Is what 
I’m doing helpful?”

French horror flick, “Raw”

ABC

Jenna Elfman in ABC’s new “Imaginary Mary”

‘Raw’ is a delicious blend 
of coming-of-age horror

‘Imaginary Mary’ falls 
flat and fails to deliver

French horror film is a gorey delight as it explores the life of a 
woman suppressing, and eventually giving into, cannibalism

New ABC comedy doesn’t intrigue or captivate in its quest to 
tell the story of a commitment-issue-riddled, single woman

The 
coming-of-age 
story 

is nothing new to cinema — 
but the coming-of-age horror 
flick is definitely quite the 
curveball, especially in the 
context 
of 
an 
aggressive 

pledging process for veterinary 
school that is nearly congruent 
to tales of fraternity hazing. It’s 
the absurdity of juxtaposing 
awakened cannibalism with 
hell week at vet school that 
makes 
French 
film 
“Raw” 

excel as smart horror.

The film centers on quiet, 

unassuming 
vegetarian 

Justine 
(Garance 
Marillier, 

“Junior”) beginning vet school, 
following family tradition by 
joining her bold sister Alexia 
(Ella Rumpf, “Tiger Girl”) 
at the school their parents 
attended. 
It’s 
an 
innocent 

enough premise — until one 
taste of raw meat during a 
ritual, however, awakens a 
hunger in Justine that sparks 
her gradual transition from 
shy to carnal.

The 
film 
functions 
best 

in its awareness of its own 
ridiculousness. Watching our 
heroine tear into a human 
finger like a chicken wing 
was so gruesome it produced 
uncomfortable laughter from 
the audience. But it’s also quick 
to remind us that cannibalism 
is a very real, horrifying fact 
of humanity that occurs in 
conjunction with psychopathy 

— that is to say it isn’t all that 
unrealistic. While the film 
isn’t nearly as gruesome as 
the internet hyped it to be, it 
certainly had hearts racing 
as 
the 
audience 
anxiously 

wondered 
what 
(or 
who) 

Justine would sink her teeth 
into next.

Marillier’s 
performance 

gives a tantalizing dive into 
addiction, one as incredulous 
to herself as it is to the 
audience. Transitioning from 
perpetually 
uncomfortable 

at college ragers 
to 
predatory 

drunk girl gliding 
through 
the 

dancefloor, 
her 

transformation 
is 
visceral 
and 

palpable. 
The 

cinematography 
by Ruben Impens 
(“Belgica”) 
perfectly adds to 
the tension of her progress, 
expertly capturing insatiable 
hunger by the end of the film.

The 
film 
isn’t 
without 

atmospheric fault — struggling 
to really zone in on a specific 
energy. Oftentimes the film 
felt impressively real, and then 
would just as quickly change 
to 
the 
surrealistic 
horror 

reminiscent of Dario Argento’s 
“Suspiria.” The entire film 
is a great work of horror, but 
the changing levels of realism 
added more confusion than 
psychological tension.

There were also additional 

plot 
nuances 
that 
were 

downright 
odd, 
mostly 

involving 
sexuality. 
Justine 

is paired with a gay male 
roommate (shocker, I know), 
with whom she shares a very 
strange sexual tension. Its 
culmination 
and 
aftermath 

was incredibly bizarre, albeit 
emotionally 
charged. 
The 

pairing of awakened sexuality 
and uncontrollable addiction 
provided 
some 
terrifyingly 

taut scenes, but its premise was 
ultimately unbelievable.

Yet, 
the 
most 
poignant 

facet of the film 
is this framing 
of 
learning 
by 

sexual 
shame 

with untamable 
addiction. 
Justine struggles 
to find a balance 
between 
expressing 
her 
sexuality. 

Social pressures, 

especially 
those 
from 
her 

sister, force her to explore her 
growing sexuality — all while 
constantly battling a craving 
she refuses to acknowledge.

With 
her 
first 
full-

length effort, director and 
screenwriter Julia Ducournau 
(“Junior”) 
has 
crafted 
a 

fantastically tense entry in 
modern horror. “Raw” is a 
film that feels fresh in a world 
plagued with stale horror, 
thanks to its talented cast and 
cleverly thematic premise — 
proving to be a worthy watch 
for horror fans craving an 
original take on the genre.

ABC’s 
new 
sitcom 

“Imaginary Mary” is mindless, 
and 
not 
in 
a 
good 
way. 

Struggling to find comedy in 
the conflicted life of a never-
married, 
wealthy 
marketing 

executive, “Imaginary Mary” 
tells the story of Alice, (Jenna 
Elfman, “Dharma & Greg”) a 
woman caught off-guard by 
a handsome salesman, Ben 
(Stephen 
Schneider, 
“Broad 

City”), who is divorced and 
has 
three 
children. 
Alice’s 

childhood 
and 
adolescence 

were spent in turmoil following 
her own parents’ divorce. As 
a result, a figment of Alice’s 
imagination, 
Mary 
(voiced 

by 
Rachel 
Dratch, 
“SNL”), 

appears to guide her. The 
framework of the comedy is 
glaringly obvious: Watch this 
successful woman try and fail 
to face her childhood trauma, 
conveniently delivered in the 
form of a hot man with kids! 
There is nothing subtle and in 
turn, the show fails to capture 
the audience by surprise — 
which is a cornerstone of 
humor.

After Ben and Alice’s first 

meeting, time flashes forward 
to the two of them in bed being 
interrupted 
by 
Ben’s 
kids. 

Jenna flees, unable to face 
them so suddenly, igniting the 
tension between the couple and 
within Alice that causes the 
eponymous character, Mary, 

to appear. Mary’s main job is 
to reveal Alice’s character and 
provide some asides, which are 
snappy and sharp. However, for 
a character whose existence is 
inherently strange and maybe 
funny, she fails to contribute 
anything 
truly 
significant 

except bad advice. She appears 
only to Alice and the viewer, 
but 
the 
show 

struggles 
to 

take 
advantage 

of potential for 
comedy 
here, 

too. In ensemble 
scenes, 
Mary 

gets 
swallowed 

up by the real, 
living characters’ 
actions.

“Imaginary 

Mary” is clear in demonstrating 
that its comedy supposedly lies 
in Alice’s foibles and Mary’s 
commentary. It’s no secret that 
Alice falling for someone — a 
divorcee, no less — is ironic. 
Alice’s maneuvers to avoid the 
sudden reality that she may 
be both a mother figure and 
a wife take shape in Mary, 
who gives awful advice to a 
middle-aged woman. There’s 
humor 
in 
this 
incongruity, 

too. However, the show’s form 
does not complement any of 
the ironies present. For a 30 
minute sitcom, the program 
packs in plenty of background 
and exposition through jumps 
in time and montages, but the 
consolidation of time stifle the 
completeness of the characters 
and core conflict of the series. 

By the time Alice and Ben 
arrange a formal meeting with 
the kids, Alice is a woman 
afraid of marriage and Ben is a 
hunky divorcee who is ready to 
set the plot in motion. There are 
no other major descriptors or 
traits that complicate the story.

Despite 
large 
structural 

flaws, there are some charming 

moments. 
Ben 

is 
delivering 
a 

presentation 
to 

Alice when they 
first 
meet, 
but 

his 
computer 

freezes 
on 
his 

dating 
profile. 

His webname is 
DivorcedRadDad 
and 
his 
profile 

picture 
depicts 

him wearing crocs and socks. 
Sick moves, dude! Later, when 
Alice opens up to the idea of 
meeting the kids, Ben starts 
getting 
an 
erection, 
and 

explains that “emotional stuff 
gets me excited.”

While some of its missteps 

may be due to the amount 
of 
exposition 
necessary 
to 

establish 
the 
framework 

for the sitcom, “Imaginary 
Mary” fails at making a strong 
first impression. Alice, the 
protagonist, is a flat character 
who is hard to root for. She 
is characterized only by her 
childhood trauma, which is 
explored briefly. The issues 
may be fleshed out with more 
episodes, but the show still fails 
to hit any comedic high notes. 
Don’t wait up for this one.

Dylan’s ‘Triplicate’ brings 
classic American sound
Dylan, in first album since Nobel Prize, covers the classics

I’ll put it simply: Everybody 

knows about Bob Dylan. When 
he won the Nobel Prize in 
Literature last fall (which he 

only picked up this past week), 
everyone had something to say 
about it, from the folks who 
have been with him since the 
sixties to young people who 
have only just discovered his 
music, from dedicated fans who 
love everything about him to 

more disgruntled cynics who 
claim not to like his voice.

Triplicate is the first album 

he’s released since then. It’s an 
expansive collection made up 
of covers of classic American 
songs, and it marks his thirty-
eighth studio album to date. 

Although this is Dylan’s first 
three-disc album, he’s done 
cover-comprised 
albums 

before — namely, his last two 
studio albums, Fallen Angels 
and Shadows in the Night. As 
with any album of this type, 
it makes sense to raise the 
concern: OK, these songs have 
all been done before. What new 
is being brought to the table? 
This is arguably especially true 
in the case of Dylan, who has 
received praise decade after 
decade for his ability to write 
groundbreaking and beautiful 
original lyrics and melodies. If 
the songs on this album were all 
written by other people, what is 
it about the album, other than 
the composition, that stands 
out?

But to ask this question might 

be to ignore something very 
integral to Dylan’s musicianship, 
and that is his basic love for 
what he does. Fallen Angels and 
Shadows in the Night weren’t 
his first forays into the realm 
of classic covers; in fact, he got 
his start in this style as early as 
the sixties. His very first album, 
Bob Dylan, had only two original 
songs on it. What caught the 
attention of listeners back then, 
and what continues to stand out 
today in Triplicate, is his ability 
to harness a piece emotionally 
and to recreate it using his own 

original feeling.

Just because the songs were 

written before doesn’t mean 
that they can’t be composed 
anew. “The Best is Yet to Come,” 
for instance, is originally a 
Frank Sinatra song, written 
by Cy Coleman and Carolyn 
Leigh. The original version has 
a classic, undeniable Sinatra feel 
to it: It’s full of the joy of swing, 
the class of Hollywood. Dylan’s 
version is more, well, Dylan: The 

panache is all there, but the edge 
is a little softer, the locale a little 
closer to home than Hollywood. 
It’s not a matter of it being better 
or worse than Sinatra’s version; 
it’s a matter of Dylan using his 
own musical inclinations to 
breathe a new and different 
kind of life into a piece that he 
already loved and admired. This 
comes through also in “When 
the World was Young,” a classic 
song by Philippe-Gérard, Angèle 
Vannier and Johnny Mercer, 
with a theme of nostalgia that 
Dylan captures perfectly.

It is also worth noting that 

Dylan has always been attached, 
in certain ways, to ideas of 

legend. Many of the songs that 
have made him famous have been 
ballads introducing or reviving 
old stories, folkloric narratives 
and inventive reworkings of 
traditional sequences. It is easy 
to see, then, where Dylan would 
fit in, adding his own personal 
interpretations to the legacies 
of timeless songs like Hoagy 
Carmichael’s “Stardust.” It is 
also beneficial to have these new 
versions, because even though 
these are old songs, hearing 
Dylan’s versions of them may 
help us to understand them in a 
new way.

Triplicate 
is 
overall 

thoughtfully put together, and 
worth a listen for anybody 
interested in hearing Dylan’s 
take on these songs. Even 
after so many years of prolific 
success, he isn’t slowing down, 
and it says something about his 
dedication to his craft (albeit 
something 
we 
all 
probably 

already knew by now) that 
he is still putting this level of 
attention and personality into 
his work. To be a skillful artist is 
to have enough compassion for 
the world to be able to replicate 
it completely, to say something 
about it that is truly meaningful 
in the form of a piece of art, and 
Dylan does this instinctively in 
all of his work, both covers and 
originals alike.

University

Michigan 

organization 
NOiR 
Runway 

Fashion will be presenting their 
18th annual runway show, NOiR 
S/S 2017 this Saturday. The show 
will feature clothing designed by 
University of Michigan students, 
styled by celebrity stylist Dutch 
Davis, who has worked with the 
likes of Nicki Minaj and Miley 
Cyrus.

“The production is really that 

of a professional runway show,” 
said 
NOiR 
President 
Alexis 

Wilson, an LSA senior. “I can 
promise it’s like nothing this 
campus has seen. NOiR has made 
it an effort to be innovate and 
grow in everything we have done 
throughout the year, so expect 
the show to be the best yet.”

its fashion, but on its community 
involvement. The organization 

regularly 
participates 
in 

community service initiatives,

MC 

Lyte 
devoted 

to 
empowering 

young 
men 
and 

women to pursue 
education 
and 

professionalism in 
the 
entertainment 

industry. 
NOiR’s 

donations 
will 

be 
specifically 

allocated to fund one semester of 
a minority male’s college tuition.

“We have worked really hard 

on establishing ourselves as not 
only a fashion organization, but 
a service organization,” said 
Alexa Abbott, NOiR Philanthropy 
Director a Ross senior. “This year 

we decided to be more intentional 
with our service. We wanted to 
make sure we had a local and 

national impact.

‘Ursa Minor’ yet another 
lowfi win for Nana Grizol

The indie band makes a successful return after seven years

Nana 
Grizol, 
after 
seven 

years of silence — in terms of 
official releases — has returned 
with its distinctly unrefined 
brand of lo-fi indie folk rock 
with an album that combines 
the best aspects of its first two 
efforts. The explosive energy of 
Love It Love It meets the more 
measured, pared back quality of 
Ruth on Ursa Minor, delivering 
a surplus of the both self- and 
externally-aware 
commentary 

that we’ve come to expect from 
the band. Both smart and casual, 
a central aspect of Nana Grizol’s 
identify remains the voice of 
frontman Theo Hilton, which 
never seems rushed, even over 
the frantic horns that punctuate 
the album.

Upon 
listening 
to 
Nana 

Grizol, your first thought may 
be “Wait, is this Neutral Milk 
Hotel?” You would be forgiven 
for wondering. Nana Grizol 
hails from Athens, Georgia, the 
base of the storied Elephant Six 
Recording Company (Neutral 
Milk Hotel, The Olivia Tremor 
Control, of Montreal). Although 
they are signed to Orange Twin 
— a label owned by members of 
Nana Grizol and Elf Power — 
the band has taken significant 
cues from the Elephant Six since 
their inception, and Neutral 
Milk Hotel band-members Laura 
Carter and Robbie Cucchiaro 
are regular contributors. Nana 
Grizol heavily echoes NMH in 
terms of brass, but, while NMH 
focuses on the otherworldly and 
immaculately 
strange, 
Nana 

Grizol is rooted in the moment 
and, 
more 
importantly, 
in 

reality, actively deconstructing 

the special meaning that we, as 
humans, give to the meaningless.

“Today we explored the halls 

of heroes past / All we found 
inside were autographs / And 
so I picked up one or two / But 
I still can’t tell what they do / I 
think I will return them in the 
morning,” closes the opening 
track of Ursa Minor, “Nightlights 
I.” It would be easy to write off 
Nana Grizol’s lyrical content as 
far too similar to the pseudo-
intellectual musings of a John 
Green character, but Hilton’s 
intent is pure, not tainted by 
commercialism; 
he 
simply 

tells it how he 
sees it, offering 
his 
stream-of-

consciousness 
reflections 
and 

realizations 
to 

anyone who will 
listen. The result 
is 
self-indulgent 

at times, but ultimately so 
completely human in nature that 
it’s hard to blame him.

Regardless, 
the 
musical 

content of the album should 
be enough to keep any curious 
listener coming back for more. 
Like Ruth’s instrumental, “Alice 
and 
Gertrude,” 
Ursa 
Minor 

features two short instrumentals 
— “Ursa Minor I” and “Ursa 
Minor 
II” 
— 
pleasing-but-

hollow-sounding piano ballads 
overscored by a longing oboe 
melody. Though only just over 
two minutes in combined length, 
these tracks are important in 
balancing the band’s otherwise 
word-heavy approach. Rather 
than rely on choruses to bolster 
the lengths of their songs, Nana 
Grizol, more often than not, goes 
without them. Every song is a 
densely packed, linear narrative.

Two of the most substantive 

tracks on the album fall between 
these instrumental interludes. 
First, on “Explained Away,” 
Hilton reflects on an idea akin to 
the saying that “history is written 
by the winners,” half-talking, 
half-singing: “I thought of who it 
is whose story gets remembered 
in the end / And through how 
many careful tellings does one 
practice their defense / Some 
nuances the narrator selectively 
omits / A once collective memory 
is destined to forget.” On the 
immediately 
following 
“TV 

Song,” largely about ‘fake news!!’ 
and highly partisan reporting, 

he 
leverages 
an 

attack 
directly 

at 
the 
current 

administration: 
“War machines and 
power dreams and 
racist, homophobic 
schemes 
/ 
can’t 

orient 
themselves 

to give the people what they 
need.”

Across its 34 minutes, the 

album oscillates between these 
sorts of macro issues and personal 
hardship. Disillusionment with 
not just government but human 
society in general characterizes 
“Mississippi 
Swells,” 
which 

laments the grand disorganization 
and indistinguishable nature of 
large cities, while “Bright Cloud” 
finds our narrator grappling 
with a recent breakup, “Trying 
to find thoughts to explain / The 
significance of the newfound 
solitude.” Characterized by a 
general sense of melancholic 
nostalgia, Ursa Minor is proof 
that 
even 
over 
time, 
Nana 

Grizol remains overwhelmingly 
consistent in their delivery, the 
sort of quietly humble underdog 
that so obviously deserves more 
attention than it has ever gotten.

STYLE NOTEBOOK
An Ode to the Rollerball

Want to know an un-fun 

fact? Perfumes spoil in six to 
18 months. And that’s if they’re 
stored properly, and I’m going to 
guess that they’re not. Because 
who in the world stores their 
perfume in a cool, dry place with 
no sunlight, i.e. a closet? So in 
all likelihood your scents will 
wither away sooner.

I 
have 
an 
embarrassing 

confession: I have purchased 
ungodly amounts of perfume 
under the pretense of a truly 
absurd fantasy. In my little 
reverie, a male colleague will 
find himself casually in close 
proximity to the nape of my neck 
— maybe it was purposeful, but 
it probably was not. While there, 
he will take note of my subtle 
but sweet scent, a mental double 
take will occur and suddenly 
he will find me both alluring 
and mysterious. Yes, I know, 
it’s ridiculous, but it still fueled 
many 
purchases. 
Yet 
faced 

with the reality of my rapidly 
depreciating perfume, it was 
suddenly much harder to justify 
the purchase of a $100 perfume, 
of which I will only use about 15 
percent.

That being said, perfume 

holds a certain romanticism that 
extends past the desire to smell 
good after skipping a shower, 
and I was not quite ready to 
let go. Thankfully there was a 
solution, right underneath my 
nose: the rollerball. 

Perfumes 
are 
really 

expensive, rollerballs not so 
much. Forking over $75-100 for 
a bottle smaller than your hand 
is not the most fun. And, as 
previously established, the bulk 
of that money will go to waste, 
which makes the purchase all 

the more painful. Rollerballs are 
much more moderately priced 
(roughly $15-35) and you can 
smell exactly the same without 
having to rationalize spending 
a ton.

What’s more, rollerballs are 

incredibly 
convenient. 
Just 

throw ’em in your bag, your 
pencil case, or even your pocket. 
Their teeny travel-sized state 
means you can have them with 
you at all times.

This is majorly convenient 

because 
you 
don’t 
have 
to 

overdose on your scent. Perhaps 
I am just incompetent, but I have 
yet to master the right amount 
to spray on in the morning. 
In an attempt to survive the 
whole day smelling pleasantly, 
I cloak myself in a true cloud 
of perfume. I leave the house 
with near eye-watering levels of 
scent. My apologies to anyone 
who has gagged in the presence 
my borderline-toxic level of 
fragrance. Oof, I cringe at the 
memory. Thankfully, this is an 
issue you can completely sidestep 
with the good ’ole rollerball. With 
a rollerball, just apply a moderate 
amount and touch up throughout 
the day. You’ll be riding a scent 
nirvana the whole day.

Buy a rollerball, thank me 

later.

Michigan falters against Maryland

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

lacrosse team has been searching 
for a signature win since the 
program’s conception four years 
ago. Saturday, the Wolverines had 
another opportunity to earn their 
first win over a ranked opponent 
against No. 1 Maryland. 

Michigan would have to wait a 

little longer, though.

The Terrapins (2-0 Big Ten, 11-0 

overall) jumped on the Wolverines 
early, scoring the first three 
goals of the game in under just 
eight minutes. Michigan coach 
Jennifer Ulehla called a timeout to 
regroup her team, and though the 
Wolverines answered with two 
goals in the next two minutes, they 
couldn’t keep up with Maryland, 
eventually losing, 20-7.

“Defensively, I just had to get 

in the message,” Ulehla said. “The 
message was we were just too 
scattered, and we needed to focus 

more on playing man-to-man — 
really bodying up, forcing them 
wide as we could and working 
with our goalie. We had too much 
switching going on, too much 
help happening when we didn’t 
really need to, and then we weren’t 
shifting back.

“… We actually came back, and 

I believe we scored two goals. I 
really felt like that could be a big 
growing point for us, but obviously 
in order to win a game you need a 
lot more of that.”

Michigan was outplayed in 

nearly every facet of the game, 
losing the shots total, 34-18, 
the turnover battle, 18-9, and 
committing 22 penalties to the 
Terrapins’ six.

The one category in which the 

Wolverines got the edge was in 
draw controls. Though Maryland 
is No. 12 nationally in draw controls 
per game, Michigan dominated 
that category Saturday, 18-11.

“We keep improving as a 

team,” said senior midfielder Kim 

Coughlan on winning the draw 
control battle. “(Senior midfielder) 
Anna Schueler has been doing 
awesome on finding the ball off 
the draws. I think today she beat 
her record and got 10 draws today.”

Throughout the season, the 

Wolverines have rotated their 
goaltenders somewhat regularly. 
Sophomore 
Mira 
Shane 
and 

redshirt freshman Alli Kothari 
have played in 11 games each, and 
have similar statistics to show for 
it.

Saturday, Shane got the nod in 

net and struggled, saving just eight 
of the 28 shots she faced on net. But 
despite her performance, Ulehla 
feels that Shane gives Michigan 
the best chance to win.

“Right now Mira is the more 

solid goalkeeper,” Ulehla said. 
“She’s just more consistent. We 
take a lot of shots in practice, 
and she’s the one really coming 
up with most of the saves. For 
the most part, with the amount 
of shots she saw (Saturday), she 

made some great saves. We could 
always use a few more, but I think 
defensively if we had stood a little 
bit stronger, she would have had a 
better opportunity.”

The Wolverines will return 

home 
Tuesday 
to 
take 
on 

Niagara before getting another 
opportunity to beat a ranked 
opponent, as they travel to face No. 
20 Johns Hopkins next Saturday.

If Michigan is to get its first 

win against a ranked team, there 
are many areas in which it has to 
improve. But Ulehla believes the 
Wolverines can learn something 
from their loss to Maryland.

“Even 
when 
you 
watch 

Maryland on film, when you 
get them in person, they’re just 
incredibly 
explosive,” 
Ulehla 

said. “… Maryland has this push, 
a presence about themselves that 
we just haven’t grown into yet. We 
still have a young program. But all 
week, all year long, playing in the 
Big Ten and against Maryland, it’s 
like, ‘What do you have to lose?’

‘M’ finishes second 
at Pac-12 Challenge

In one of its first big tests 

of the season, the Michigan 
women’s rowing team showed 
that it will once again be 
competitive with other top 
programs 
across 
the 

country. 

In the Pac-

12 
Challenge 

this 
past 

weekend, the 
third-ranked 
Wolverines 
rowed 
alongside No. 
1 
California, 

No. 
2 
Ohio 

State, 
No. 
4 

Washington, No. 7 Virginia 
and No. 10 Stanford. Overall, 
Michigan 
placed 
second 

behind the Golden Bears in 
Redwood City, Calif.

“All 
six 
are 
perennial 

contenders,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rothstein. “It was 
good 
to 
see 

that speed this 
early 
in 
the 

season.”

The 

Wolverines 
fared well on 
Saturday, 
as 

the 1v8 and 2v8 
boats defeated 
the 
Cardinal. 

The 1v4 boat, 
on the other 
hand, lost its 
race against Stanford by 1.2 
seconds.

Saturday 
afternoon 
was 

a different story, as it saw 
Michigan lose all three of its 
races against Washington, the 
closest of which was the 1v8 
boat’s 2.62-second loss.

“We need to continue to 

build our aerobic pace and 
fitness,” 
Rothstein 
said. 

“Holding the strokes better, 
especially when things aren’t 
going well will be important as 
we move forward.”

However, the Wolverines’ 

2v8 boat had a big Sunday 
morning, notching an upset 
over California. They defeated 

the 
Golden 

Bears’ 2v8 boat 
with a time of 
6:22.81, 
while 

California 
finished the race 
with a time of 
6:26.62.

“They are a 

very 
talented 

boat,” Rothstein 
said of his 2v8 
boat. 
“They 

raced their best 

race so far.”

While neither of the other 

two boats were able to defeat 
the 
Golden 
Bears’ 
boats, 

Rothstein was very excited 
about what he saw on the 
water this weekend.

“We showed good speed 

this weekend,” 
Rothstein said. 
“But we didn’t 
do that well this 
morning. There 
is still speed to 
be gained, and 
things to work 
on.”

Michigan had 

a good weekend 
in 
California, 

and will next 
turn its sights to 

the Big Ten Dual Meet in East 
Lansing next weekend.

“Every meet is a chance 

to progress,” Rothstein said. 
“All 
competitions 
are 
an 

opportunity to improve.”

The season is just underway 

for the Wolverines, but based 
on the show they put on this 
weekend, they could be on 
their way to a good one.

Wolverines finish eighth in Greensboro

The Michigan women’s golf 

team played its closest meet 
geographically all season – 480 
miles from Ann Arbor. 

After 
traveling 
to 
South 

Carolina, Texas, Puerto Rico, 
Florida 
and 
California 
for 

tournaments 
earlier 
in 
the 

season, the Wolverines made 
the relatively short trip to the 
Bryan National Collegiate in 
Greensboro, N.C.

To Michigan’s benefit, many 

of the players on the team had 
played the course before – 
the Wolverines finished 11th 
in the same tournament last 
season. Still, Michigan coach 
Jan Dowling said that past 
experience with a course can 
only be so helpful.

“It’s 
nice 
to 
have 
some 

familiarity with the course, to 
know some of the lies and the 
layout of the holes,” Dowling 
said. “But every tournament is 
different, so we have to come 

prepared to play.”

Play at the Bryan Park Golf 

Course was scheduled to begin 
on Friday, but the round was 
postponed due to inclement 
weather. Earlier in the day, the 
tournament organizers decided 
to push the day’s round back, 
creating a 36-hole Saturday.

Michigan 

was 
finally 

able 
to 
tee 

off 
Saturday 

morning, 
shooting a score 
of 296 – good 
for 
seventh-

best 
in 
the 

tournament. 
Leading 
the 

Wolverines was 
senior 
Grace 

Choi, who shot a 72 for the 
round. Junior Megan Kim and 
freshman Alisa Snyder followed 
Choi with each shooting a 74.

After round one, there was 

no time to relax back in the 
clubhouse, as Michigan went 
back out for its second round of 

the day. The Wolverines shot a 
team total of 299, putting them 
at ninth out of 18 teams heading 
into the final day. Choi once 
again led Michigan with a 71 
and Snyder was again not too 
far behind, recording a 74 of her 
own.

The Wolverines’ last day 

turned 
out 
to 

be their best, as 
the team shot a 
combined 
290. 

For 
the 
third 

straight day, Choi 
led the team with 
a 
third-round 

mark of 70.

“We had the 

fifth-lowest 
score of all of the 
teams on Sunday, 

in 
a 
field 
which 
included 

multiple 
top-20 
teams,” 

Dowling said.

Sunday’s 
total 
put 
the 

Wolverines at a weekend total 
of 885 – 21 over par – and 
leapfrogged them to eighth 
place over No. 12 Wake Forest. 

The score was 34 strokes higher 
than first-place Alabama’s, but 
just 20 strokes behind runner-
up Georgia’s – a difference of 
slightly more than one stroke 
per golfer per round.

Choi entered Sunday tied 

for ninth place overall, and her 
performance in the final round 
cemented her position. She 
finished with a three under par 
total of 213 – just three strokes 
behind 
first-place 
Kristen 

Gillman of Alabama.

Michigan has a week off 

before playing closer to Ann 
Arbor than ever before again, in 
the seemingly neighborly city of 
Columbus. But despite having 
to travel across the country 
every weekend, Dowling insists 
the golfers do not mind.

“In order to play golf we 

need warm weather, and the 
South has that,” Dowling said. 
“The girls like going on all of 
the trips, but as we keep going 
farther into spring we start to 
have more tournaments in the 
North.”

MEN’S TENNIS
Michigan wins in 
enemy territory

The No. 18 Michigan men’s 

tennis 
team 
finished 
the 

weekend with two road victories 
in 
conference 
play, 
routing 

Indiana and Purdue.

Coming off a tough loss in 

their most recent match — a 
4-1 home defeat to No. 3 Ohio 
State — the Wolverines (4-1 Big 
Ten, 14-4 overall) rebounded 
in dominant fashion as they 
blanked the Hoosiers (1-3 Big 
Ten, 10-8 overall) 7-0 on Friday 
in Bloomington before beating 
the Boilermakers 6-1 on Sunday.

“It was a good win for us on the 

road, 
Purdue’s 

a good team,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach 
Adam 

Steinberg. 
“They’re much 
improved from 
past years. To 
win 
7-0 
and 

6-1 on the road 
like we did this 
weekend is a big 
improvement 
from us.”

The 
Wolverines 
were 

spearheaded 
against 
Purdue 

(2-3 Big Ten, 13-10 overall) by 
their No. 1 and No. 2 singles 
players, senior Jathan Malik and 
junior Alex Knight, who each 
won tight matches in three sets. 
Malik fought back after losing 
the first set, 6-1, by taking the 
second set, 7-5, and winning 
the deciding tiebreaker, 10-4, 
over the Boilermakers’ Gergely 
Madarasz.

Knight 
also 
came 
from 

behind against Ricky Medinilla 
after losing the first set, 6-3, 
by winning the second set, 7-5, 
and then outlasting Medinilla 
in a close 10-8 tiebreak to hand 
Michigan a key early advantage.

Sophomore 
Myles 
Schalet 

followed this performance up 
with a victory at No. 3 singles, 
ousting Benjamin Ugarte, 6-3, 
6-1. Also contributing were 

junior Carter Lin with a win 
at No. 5 singles over Renan 
Hanayama, 6-0, 6-2, and junior 
Davis Crocker with a win at No. 
6 singles over Athell Bennett, 
6-2, 6-4.

These victories offset the loss 

by junior Runhao Hua at No. 
4 singles to Purdue’s Stephan 
Koenigsfest, 6-3, 6-4. All six of 
Michigan’s singles players were 
also victorious in their matches 
against Indiana on Friday.

The 
Wolverines 
notched 

wins in two out of three doubles 
matches against Purdue, with 
Malik and freshman Connor 
Johnston holding off Madarasz 
and Medinilla, 6-3, in the No. 1 

doubles 
match. 

Michigan 
also 

won, 6-3, in the 
No. 
3 
doubles 

matchup 
between Schalet 
and senior Kevin 
Wong 
against 

Purdue’s Bennett 
and Koenigsfest.

That 

capped 
off 
an 

undefeated week 

for Michigan doubles, which 
stands as one of the key areas of 
improvement for the team this 
season.

“We’re 
playing 
more 

aggressive in doubles and getting 
more belief in singles,” Steinberg 
said. “We have such a deep team 
that we can withstand some 
injuries and other things. It 
gives us an air of confidence.”

The Wolverines will return 

home this weekend with three 
matches 
against 
Minnesota, 

Wisconsin, and Aquinas on a 
high note after taking care of 
business on the road.

“Our goals are always the 

same, our goal is to win a 
National 
Championship 
here 

at Michigan so that’s what 
we’re working towards,” said 
Steinberg. 
“Each 
match 
is 

another step towards that. The 
guys have a lot to be proud of, 
they’ve come a long way.”

‘M’ rolling into midweek matchups

The No. 18 Michigan baseball 

team (4-2 Big 
Ten, 
22-6 

overall) 
is 

coming 
off 

three blowouts 
over 
Penn 

State this past 
weekend 
and 

will look to stay 
hot going into 
two 
midweek 

games 
tomorrow and 
Wednesday 
against 
Notre 

Dame 
and 

Bowling Green, 
respectively. 

The 

Wolverines’ 
offense fired on all cylinders this 
weekend, amassing 39 runs and 38 
hits. Arguably more impressive, 
though, 
is 
that 
Michigan’s 

pitching staff limited the Nittany 
Lions to just nine runs.

The 
Wolverines’ 
matchups 

against the Fighting Irish (4-8 
ACC, 10-16 overall) and the 
Falcons (3-3 MAC, 7-17 overall) 

will serve as a brief break from 
conference play before facing 
Illinois (0-3, 9-16).

“The focus is more on how we 

play,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “And so, we just have a 
trust factor that the scorecard is 
going to come out in our favor.”

Considering both Notre Dame 

and Bowling Green have faced off 
against a common foe in Northern 
Illinois before, the Wolverines 
can gauge their competition.

The Fighting Irish battled 

Northern Illinois on March 21 and 
prevailed, 12-1. The Falcons also 
played the Huskies this weekend, 
dropping their first matchup, 
11-0, but scraped back to win both 
games in a double-header the 
next day. When Michigan played 
Northern Illinois in a weekend 
series earlier in the season, it won 
three of the four games by close 
margins.

However, with the way the 

Wolverines have been playing 
recently, any past context may not 
be relevant.

Headlining 
the 
Michigan 

squad 
offensively 
is 
senior 

shortstop 
Michael 
Brdar 
— 

hitting .327 with 37 hits and 21 
RBI — and junior third baseman 

Drew Lugbauer — hitting .296 
with eight home runs and 34 RBI.

Notre 
Dame’s 
highest 

producing player on offense is 
Nick Podkul, hitting .299, with 
no other member of the team 
hitting over .300. Meanwhile, 
Bowling Green is led by Greg 
Basalyga, who currently boasts a 
.310 batting average with 10 runs 
and 13 RBI.

With the Fighting Irish and the 

Falcons posting .229 and .218 team 
batting averages, respectively, 
their offensive outputs pale in 
comparison to Michigan’s .290 
cumulative batting average.

To tilt the scales even further 

in Michigan’s favor, junior right-
hander Alec Rennard is expected 
to take the mound against Notre 
Dame. Rennard has been a staple 
for midweek starts as of late, with 
a 4-1 record and 3.08 earned-run 
average.

The Wolverines will have to 

take this week one game at a time 
without looking ahead to their 
Big Ten matchups against Illinois 
this weekend. Notre Dame’s 
starting pitchers boast a 4.42 
average ERA, which could be 
solid enough to give Michigan’s 
offense a run for its money. 

Notebook: Duffy leaves for Miami 
(Ohio), no clarity on Gondrezick 

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team just finished 
celebrating its victory in the 
championship game of the 
Women’s National Invitation 
Tournament. Beginning next 
season, the Wolverines will be 
able to look up at the rafters in 
Crisler Center and see a banner 
of their very own. 

“We got the banner for that 

senior class,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “It’s 
just incredible. They deserve 
it. They’ve meant so much to 
our program.”

But 
even 
though 
the 

offseason 
just 
started 
for 

Michigan, there has already 
been a departure from and 
an addition to the Wolverine 
family.

Megan Duffy Hired at 

Miami (Ohio):

Just two days after winning 

the WNIT, Barnes Arico is 
officially looking for a new 
assistant coach.

After three seasons coaching 

the Wolverines’ guards, Megan 
Duffy has accepted the head 
coaching job at Miami (Ohio). 
The job will be a homecoming 
of sorts for Duffy, who grew up 
in Dayton, Ohio, just 40 miles 
from Miami’s campus.

Duffy’s 
presence 
will 

certainly 
be 
missed 
by 

Michigan, 
as 
she 
was 

responsible for coaching junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty to 
2,019 career points, All-Big 
Ten honors and the Most 
Valuable Player award in the 
2017 WNIT.

Duffy is a longtime veteran 

of Barnes Arico’s staff — 
dating back to Barnes Arico’s 
time at St. Johns. Duffy’s first 
coaching job after her three-
year WNBA career was on 
Barnes Arico’s Red Storm staff. 

During Barnes Arico’s time 

with St. John’s, Duffy served as 
recruiting coordinator while 
also working with guards, 
game planning, scouting and 
scheduling. Her efforts paid 

off, as the Red Storm earned 
a No. 3 seed in the 2012 NCAA 
Tournament and advanced to 
the Sweet 16.

The Redhawks hope that 

Duffy’s magic as an assistant 
coach will translate to head-
coaching 
prowess. 
Miami’s 

record 
under 
former 
head 

coach Cleve Wright was a 
dismal 35-87, including an 
11-27 showing this season.

Michigan 
gets 
a 
new 

recruit:

Back in Nov. 2016, three-

star wing Priscilla Smeenge 
of Carroll High School in 
Southlake, Texas committed 
to the University of Florida. 
Smeenge, 
the 
38th-highest 

ranked wing in the country 
according to ESPN, earned a 
spot in the 2017 McDonald’s 
All-American Game as one of 
the nation’s top prep players.

But the Gators will not 

be getting her services. On 
Monday, she announced her 
decommitment from Florida and 
will instead be signing with the 

Wolverines. She joins forward 
Hailey Brown and guard Deja 
Church 
in 
Michigan’s 
2017 

recruiting class.

Still 
no 
word 
on 

Gondrezick situation:

Speaking 
of 
recruits, 

Barnes 
Arico’s 
biggest 

accomplishment 
on 
the 

recruiting trail last year was 
Benton Harbor, Mich. guard 
Kysre Gondrezick, who scored 
72 points in a high-school 
playoff game in 2016. She lived 
up to her billing this season, 
averaging 14.9 points and 3.6 
rebounds and a spot on the Big 
Ten All-Freshman Team.

But prior to the Wolverines’ 

third-round 
WNIT 
game 

against 
St. 
John’s, 
they 

announced that Gondrezick 
was 
taking 
an 
indefinite 

leave of absence for “personal 
reasons.” 
Michigan 
has 

remained mum as to why 
Gondrezick has been absent, 
and the Wolverines have not 
released any information on 
when — or if — she will return.

Four takeaways from Michigan’s 12-game win streak

Over the past three weeks, the 

No. 20 Michigan softball team 
(6-0 Big Ten, 26-7-1 overall) has 
mounted an impressive 12-game 
win streak — 11 of which have come 
at home. With the majority of the 
season’s home schedule complete, 
the Daily looks at four main 
takeaways from the Wolverines’ 
recent success, as the pieces are 
slowly coming together to make 
them a formidable threat against 
Big Ten competition. 

Pitching dominance continues
Michigan’s rotation of right-

handers Megan Betsa and Tera 
Blanco has ironed out early-
season kinks to display pure 
dominance, pitching seven straight 
shutouts, 
including 
three 
last 

weekend against Northwestern. 
Together, the hurlers have offset 
the 
Wolverines’ 
difficulty 
in 

generating runs.

Betsa continues to prove she is 

one of the best pitchers in collegiate 
softball, 
leading 
the 
country 

with 221 strikeouts alongside 48 
consecutive 
scoreless 
innings. 

Displaying a newfound confidence 
after self-doubt and uncertainty 
with mechanics in years past, she 
has limited opponents to an anemic 
.139 batting average while posting 
a stellar 1.23 earned-run average. 
The senior’s three complete-game 
shutouts this past week — adding 
to her own seven straight shutouts 
— earned her the third consecutive 
Big Ten Pitcher of the Week award.

Blanco 
has 
shown 
similar 

effectiveness 
on 
the 
mound. 

Recruited as a pitcher but converted 
to first baseman her freshman and 
sophomore years, the junior has 
stepped into the second spot in the 
rotation. Boasting a 13-2 record 
and 1.87 ERA, she has looked more 
poised than ever during the recent 
homestand. Blanco has gone the 
distance in 11 of 15 games, allowing 
Betsa to fully rest on scheduled 
days off.

“She has to carry the other half 

of the load because Megan is not 

going to be effective if we pitch her 
all the innings of the season,” said 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“Tera has done her part and 
embraced pitching. She wants to 
win and wants to be good. She’s 
improved in every category and 
most importantly in attitude.”

Tasked 
with 
mentoring 

Blanco at the season’s outset and 
developing her pitching arsenal, 
Betsa and Blanco continue to learn 
from one other, the mentorship 
now a “two-way street.”

“We’re just working really well 

together,” Betsa said. “And Tera’s 
come a long way. She’s worked 
really hard, and her confidence 
has risen along with mine. That’s 
something you have to have to 
dominate in the circle, and so that’s 
something we both try to get better 
at every single day, and we work 
well together.”

Canfield, Vargas add offensive 

spark

Sophomore 
second 
baseman 

Faith 
Canfield 
and 
junior 

designated player Amanda Vargas 
have risen to the occasion in big 
ways to help a struggling offense.

Canfield has consistently hit the 

cover off the ball, batting .356 with 
37 hits, 34 runs and 65 total bases. 
Not usually known for her power, 
the sophomore presents a matured 
approach at the plate, making hard 
and solid contact almost every 
at-bat.

“Faith has been just working 

hard and improving,” Hutchins 
said after a 17-0 rout over Penn 
State on Mar. 26. “I think she 
plays with a great energy, which I 
think helps you play better. … She 
has great rhythm and is swinging 
well. So, she is making it look kind 
of easy. I’d like to think that that 
inspires the group — that ‘You can 
do it, if I can do it.’”

Despite starting just 15 games, 

Vargas continues to make the most 

of her opportunities, sporting 
the team’s third-highest batting 
average of .364 and a .591 slugging 
percentage. When senior center 
fielder Kelly Christner dropped 
to seventh in the order, Vargas 
assumed the third slot and has held 
onto it ever since.

Though not playing in the 

field, Vargas believes her role as 
designated player has its perks.

“It gives you a little bit more time 

to think about your at-bat, and what 
I did wrong or what I did right, and 
really focus on just hitting,” Vargas 
said. “… I’m always going to be 
ready whenever Coach needs me 
or whenever the team needs me 
and I’m open for any position … I’m 
always excited to help the team in 
whatever we need.”

Senior impact improving
After a first month in which she 

earned Big Ten Player of the Week 
honors, Christner’s dominance at 
the plate tapered off. Though her 

average still hovered around .450, 
the senior experienced a major 
setback during a 10-game stretch, 
batting just .208 with two runs 
batted in and no extra-base hits. 
As Christner headlines the seniors’ 
offensive muscle, her lack of 
production was noticeable, which 
led to a move to the lineup’s seven 
hole.

But after this weekend against 

Northwestern, 
Christner’s 

production may be back, this 
time coupled with the success of 
senior shortstop Abby Ramirez 
at the plate. Thanks partly to a 
new batting stance, Christner 
has hit .636 in the last four games 
with six RBI and two extra-base 
hits, including a game-winning 
home run last Tuesday against 
Central Michigan. On top of that, 
she notched a 2-for-2, four RBI 
performance on Friday against 
Northwestern. Ramirez returned 
to her consistent self too, going 

4-for-7 with four RBI and three 
runs over the weekend.

Hutchins 
believes 

upperclassmen turning the corner 
is vital to the Wolverines’ late-
season fate.

“To have the kind of success 

that they are aspiring to, you really 
need the seniors,” Hutchins said. “I 
count on Kelly Christner, I count 
on Abby, I count on (senior third 
baseman Lindsay Montemarano) 
and I count on Betsa. We count 
on them. If they don’t have good 
weekends or good seasons, we’re 
not going to have one, that’s just 
a fact. Your best players have to 
contribute regularly … or you’ll be 
average or less.”

Permanent lineup starts to 

take shape

After continuously tweaking 

the batting order through the first 
half of the season, it remained 
fairly consistent against Central 
Michigan 
and 
Northwestern, 

inferring Hutchins has found the 
best recipe to maximize offensive 
output.

With Vargas playing extremely 

well as of late, Hutchins has 
started her at designated player. 
But with junior Aidan Falk and 
her .315 batting average waiting 
in the wings, Hutchins holds the 
happy dilemma of who to start at 
designated player and first base — a 
position that both Falk and Blanco 
play — when Betsa is pitching.

After moving around offensive 

and 
defensive 
personnel, 

Hutchins toyed with her outfield, 
starting Falk in right and shifting 
sophomore 
outfielder 
Natalie 

Peters to left. This way, Falk can 
produce at the plate while Vargas 
and Blanco remain in the order.

“I want Vargas in the lineup 

and I want Aidan in the lineup 
and I want Tera in the lineup, but 
I only have one first base position,” 
Hutchins said. “So this way, I can 
start Aidan in right, let her have an 
at-bat or two, then put in the true 
outfielder. We’re just trying to keep 
our best offense moving, which is 
hard to tell some days who’s our 
best offense.”
