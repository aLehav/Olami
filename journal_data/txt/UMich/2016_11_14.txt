ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

IOWA CITY — It seemed like 

it would be Michigan’s special 
teams that would win the day. 
Instead, it was Iowa’s.

After fifth-year senior kicker 

Kenny Allen booted a career-
long 51-yard field goal midway 
through the fourth quarter to 
put the Wolverines up, 13-11, 
and after senior cornerback 
Channing Stribling picked up 
an interception with under two 
minutes remaining, it looked 
like the Wolverines had the 
game in the bag. 

But the Hawkeyes got one 

more chance, and they made it 
count. Hawkeye kicker Keith 
Duncan hit a 33-yard chip 
shot as time expired, and Iowa 
pulled off a stunning 14-13 upset 
Saturday at Kinnick Stadium.

Iowa’s defense was able to 

hold the Wolverines to just 98 
rushing yards, the first time 
all season they have been held 
under 100.

“There were some wrinkles, 

they played well, they played 
hard, they set the edge extremely 
well,” said Michigan coach 
Harbaugh of the Hawkeyes’ 
defense after the game. “They 
tackled well and played good 
coverage.”

Just before Allen’s made field 

goal, it seemed as if the Michigan 
football team was sleepwalking. 
It had converted on just five 
of its attempted third downs. 
But then redshirt sophomore 
quarterback Wilton Speight had 
a rare scramble for four yards, 
and then he completed just his 
10th pass of the game to senior 
tight end Jake Butt, who picked 
up 17 yards for a first down. The 
Wolverines would still be forced 
to punt three downs later, but 
they caught a break on the play. 

A 
roughing-the-center 

penalty on Iowa gave Michigan 
the ball back on the Hawkeyes’ 
36-yard line just after Speight 
overthrew an open Darboh 
streaking toward the end zone, 
ultimately setting up Allen’s 
dramatic field goal.

But the tide would change 

Two hundred students, faculty 

and staff gathered on the Diag at 
6 p.m. Saturday night to partake 
in a protest titled “Opposing 
Intimidation!”

The protest was organized 

by Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior James Ross Kilmeade in 
response to an incident Friday 
evening in which a student 
was approached by a man who 
demanded she remove her hijab 
or he would use a lighter to set her 
on fire. This incident is still under 
investigation by the Ann Arbor 
Police Department. 

According to Kilmeade’s post 

on the Facebook event, the protest 
aimed to generally respond to the 
hatred he feels has been validated 
by the recent election.

Before the protest began, 

Kilmeade said he had created the 
event only hours before it started 
and hoped to reach as many 
people as possible. 

“Today I woke up and said, 

‘I don’t know what I’m going 
to do but I have to stand and do 

something,” he said. “People have 
to feel safe and it’s absurd that 
they don’t. It’s our responsibility 
to be out here for them.’ ” 

LSA senior Adrian Rakochi 

said he heard about the protest 

through an email sent to the 
Arabic 
Activities 
club, 
and 

expressed his frustration with 
recent 
incidents 
following 

the election, both locally and 
nationally.

“I wanted to go,” he said. “I 

feel like we haven’t had enough 
protests in Ann Arbor about 
this whole thing anyway. I just 
showed up and let some friends

The Michigan Daily administered 

a women’s health survey, to 1,000 
randomly selected respondents at 
the University of Michigan campus. 
There were 147 respondents, with 
115 self-identifying as female.

The following article includes 

data collected in this survey, 
particularly with regard to safety on 
campus.

When Jocelyn Aptowitz, a dual-

enrolled School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance and LSA junior, was a 
freshman, a man in a car asked her 

for directions while she was walking 
back from a rehearsal at the Student 
Theatre 
Arts 
Complex 
around 

Hoover Street in 2014.

She said the man followed close 

behind in his vehicle and eventually 
exited the car pantsless, wearing 
nothing from the waist down.

Once Aptowitz saw the man 

touching himself, she said she 
quickly walked away and called the 
University of Michigan Division of 
Public Safety and Security as well as 
the Ann Arbor Police Department. 
She received a quick response 
from officials, who later found and 
identified the man.

“There’s something so unsettling 

and degrading about it,” Aptowitz 
said of the incident. “The lines of 
body autonomy and, I think, safety, 
specifically, get blurred sometimes, 
but you’re definitely more aware of 
it after you experience it firsthand.”

Aptowitz’s sentiments are far 

from unique on campus.

In a survey administered to 

female students by The Michigan 
Daily, 73.11 percent of respondents 
said they were afraid to walk home 
alone on campus. 17.65 percent said 
they did not and 9.24 percent said 
they were unsure.

In a campus climate survey 

administered by the University to 
both male and female students in 

2015, 89 percent of students reported 
feeling safe from sexual misconduct 
on campus.

Bill Axinn, a national expert on 

survey research at the University 
Population Studies Center, said there 
could be a number of reasons for the 
discrepancies in the datasets. Axinn 
said in addition to the differences 
in wording — the University survey 
asked if students “felt safe from 
sexual misconduct on campus” 
while the Daily survey asked if 
students “felt afraid to walk home 
alone on campus” — as well as a small 
sample size in the Daily’s survey and 
a tendency for respondents to agree

Current aesthetic: the 
michigan football player 
wandering around east 
quad dining hall looking 
completely lost

with questions asked could be 
errors present in both surveys.

Despite 
the 
differences 

between 
the 
two 
surveys, 

multiple female students like 
Aptowitz have voiced concerns 
for their safety at night, and 
attributed some of that to specific 
areas of campus where lighting is 
insufficient.

Much like Aptowitz, LSA 

sophomore Vianney Flores said 
she has taken steps during her 
time at the University to avoid 
vulnerable situations, especially 
when she lived in Baits II 
Residence Hall dorms on North 
Campus her freshman year. She 
said she only left at night if it 
couldn’t be avoided because she 
was weary of the nearby wooded 
areas, which do not have much 
surrounding lighting.

This year, she lives in Alice 

Lloyd Residence Hall, a location 
closer than North Campus, but 
still a 10-minute walk from the 
Diag.

“Especially if it’s dark, I don’t 

really feel comfortable walking 
by myself,” Flores said. “I do 
it, but I’m always extremely 
cautious when I do. If there’s 
anyone walking behind me, I 
have no problems checking if it’s 
a guy or a girl — if you think I’m 
being suspicious of you, I am, 
because it’s my safety.”

Originally 
from 
Chicago, 

Flores said she is used to living 
in a big city environment and, 
though she feels more secure in 
Ann Arbor, she is still cautious.

“I’m super aware of bushes 

when 
I’m 
walking 
around,” 

Flores said. “If someone just put 
their hand over my mouth and 
hid me in the bush, no one would 
know I was there if someone 
was walking around. I’m always 
aware of that.”

Call for action

Though Aptowitz said she 

appreciated the quick action 
from DPSS and AAPD following 
her incident, it led to her start 
carrying pepper spray and a small 
sharp object for the remainder of 
her freshman year.

Because Aptowitz said she 

does not believe there has 
not been enough effort put 
toward campus safety from the 
University, she thinks increased 
lighting would make her feel 
more at ease.

“Ever since this (incident), 

I will stand at blue lights and 
you’re supposed to see blue lights 
from every blue light and that’s 
just actively untrue on campus,” 
Aptowitz said. “But the thing is, 
we tell people that on our tours, 
and that’s what’s frustrating. If 
we’re going to advertise that we’re 
a campus that has that safety, we 
should have that safety.”

Despite 
efforts 
last 
year, 

Central 
Student 
Government 

ultimately was unable to make 
headway in initiatives aimed at 
increasing off-campus security 
measures through the installation 
of more streetlights.

In an April CSG meeting, 

then-CSG 
President 
Cooper 

Charlton attributed the failure in 
installation and improvement to 
both the cost as well as a lack of 
relationship between the city of 
Ann Arbor and CSG.

“We ran into two issues: the 

first problem is that it can cost as 
much as $400,000 to $600,000 
per corridor for installation, so 
assessing the finances of the 
operation was a hurdle that 
we were unable to overcome,” 
Charlton said at the meeting. 
“The other problem that we faced 
was with cooperation from the 
city.”

In addition to these efforts, last 

April about five students started 
a petition to install cameras on 
the blue light phones located 
throughout campus. More than 
200 students eventually signed 
the position, noting concern for 
identifying a potential attacker.

 However, the city of Ann 

Arbor has come up with a plan 
to spend $200,000 on new street 
lights near Nixon and Dhu Varren 
Roads, Washtenaw Avenue and 
Division and East University 
Streets, following a lift on a 
moratorium on new streetlights 
last year by City Council.

CSG also outlined goals last 

year to develop another campus 
safety 
app 
in 
conjunction 

with previous projects such as 
SafeRide — a free service that 

transports students, faculty and 
staff within a one-mile radius of 
campus — and Night Owl, yet they 
were unable to follow through, 
again due to lack of resources. 
However, other organizations 
and students started to take 
on these projects themselves, 
including five Ross School of 
Business students who developed 
the 
now-internationally 

recognized Companion app.

For LSA freshman Alexis 

Aulepp — though she uses some 
of the same cautionary measures 
as Aptowitz and Flores — the 
availability of these applications 
is not necessarily needed, as she 
said she has not experienced 
anything since coming to the 
University that would be cause 
for concern.

Unlike Aptowitz, both Flores 

and Aulepp — who lives in 
Alice Lloyd — said they have 
not 
experienced 
any 
issues 

warranting their fears and do not 
carry any protective device, such 
as a whistle, pepper spray or a 
weapon, while they walk around 
campus.

“Had nobody said anything, 

I would have felt just fine, but 
because people say don’t walk 
alone, that has made me be a little 
more self-conscious about those 
types of things,” Aulepp said. 
“Multiple people have told me 
‘don’t walk alone.’ ”

Even still, neither Aulepp 

nor Flores have used University 
resources — primarily because 
they are unaware of how to use 
them — calling for the University 
to provide better education for 
the services.

University response

University 
Police 

spokeswoman Diane Brown said, 
while the University of Michigan 
Police 
Department 
preferred 

not to comment about gendered 
security measures, there are 
reasons behind there being less 
lighting in certain areas beyond 
the Diag. Brown noted that she 
has spoken with engineers who 
look into optimizing lighting 
precisely about this issue.

“What 
good 
lighting 

infrastructure placement looks 
toward is how to keep someone 
from becoming suddenly, if 
you will, blinded,” Brown said. 

“Good lighting placement says 
that lighting should be fairly 
significant just outside the door 
of (popular) facilities and then 
get a little less as you go farther 
away from the building because 
that lighting works with (the 
way your pupils are changing). 
You want this gradual change 
in the lighting system outside as 
well.”

Brown added that lighting 

should be better at places with 
high 
nighttime 
traffic, 
and 

dimmer in more deserted areas 
near buildings where people are 
sleeping, so as to detract people 
from 
congregating 
in 
areas 

intended to be quieter.

UMPD Police Chief Robert 

Neumann said part of the 
University’s 
improvements 

in overall safety on campus 
have been related to increasing 
properly working lighting, noting 
the 
department 
encourages 

student input.

“I don’t think too many people 

are seeing lights that aren’t 
working, and that’s something 
years ago that used to be a 
common problem,” Neumann 
said. “If there are areas that 
students think should be better 
lighted, I certainly want to hear 
about it.”

In addition, there are several 

other measures currently in place 
to address student concerns, 
particularly through Neumann’s 
collaboration with CSG and 
safety committees.

Public Policy junior Stephanie 

Gusching, current chair of CSG 
Community 
and 
Outreach 

Commission, 
attested 
to 

Neumann’s efforts and said CSG 
wants to initiate partnerships 
between the University and the 
city to continue to try to improve 
off-campus lighting and increase 
sexual assault resources for 
women this year.

“We want to look into more 

crime statistics in the area to 
see where off-campus lighting 
is lacking to see if improving 
lighting would end up actually 
affecting the safety in the area,” 
Gusching said. “If we can find 
a correlation, I think that that 
would be a strong argument in 
our case in improving off-campus 
lighting.”

know about it. I made a sign. I am 
very upset.” 

Rakochi’s sign read, “The only 

thing necessary for the triumph 
of evil is for good people to do 
nothing.” 

LSA senior Louisa Kane held 

up a poster that read, “You belong 
here,” in both English and Arabic. 
She said she felt that all students 
on campus should be speaking up 
at events like this. 

“Why should anyone feel like 

they don’t belong here?” she said. 
“It’s absurd. Everyone should be 
here right now, saying that they 
love and support every part of this 
community, regardless of whether 
or not they identify with that 
religion or ethnicity. Everyone 
should be here.” 

During the protest, the ‘M’ 

in the Diag was outlined with 
candles, and protesters gathered 
to hear one another speak. 

Art & Design senior Keysha 

Wall addressed the crowd on 
the election results, saying she 

was 
concerned 
about 
people 

who support the marginalizing 
rhetoric of Donald Trump.

“You saw all of this happening 

before 
Donald 
Trump 
even 

became 
president,” 
she 
said. 

“When I saw that he had gotten 
elected, he wasn’t the first thing 
I was afraid of. The first thing I 
was afraid of were the people who 
are like that who are emboldened 
by that, who are emboldened by 
his actions, him being on TV, him 
being able to say those things, who 
had already felt like they could get 
away with that sort of thing on this 
campus for years.”

Moving forward, she said, 

the most important thing the 
community can do is unite and 
fight back against prejudicial 
sentiment and violence.

“We must turn our solemnity 

into power and love for one 
another, into action, into strength, 
because that is our strength.”

Also in regard to the election 

results, Music, Theatre & Dance 
junior Keem Avraham said it is 
important to talk to others in the 
campus community and educate 
people who have different beliefs.

“You 
know 
people 
who 

voted for Donald Trump, and 
what Donald Trump does is 
endorse the idea that being 
racist — discriminating against 
marginalized identities — is OK,” 
he said. “He has endorsed that idea 
as a human American practice. As 
a friend of this community, this 
progressive-minded community, 
it is your job to change someone, 
so that they can positively affect 
somebody else.”

Multiple campus events have 

occurred since Trump’s election. 
On Wednesday, a vigil took place 
in the Diag to protest President-
elect Trump’s controversial win. 
University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel spoke of the need 
to support threatened minorities 
and called for University-wide 
support in action.

LSA senior Arielle Chen told 

the crowd she thought it was 
important for students to speak 
out and show up at activism events 
even if they are speaking from a 
place of privilege as an ally.

“I am so tired of hearing people 

say, ‘I’m sorry this is happening. 
I’m so sorry,’ ” she said. “Silence 
means that you are allowing it, 
that you are supporting it. Silence 

means ism is OK. If you do 
nothing, if you say nothing, 
you are supporting it. People 
need you to show up now. If 
this is the first time you have 
ever stood at a protest, we 
need you to continue showing 
up. I ask you to show up for 
your friends, for the person 
standing next to you, for the 
person across the circle that 
you have never talked to.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Ilina 

Krishen said she thought 
there is a certain danger in 
being a bystander.

“Being a bystander is the 

worst thing you can do, even 
worse than being the bully,” 
she said. “Looking away from 
a crime does not hide the 
crime. I’m asking everyone 
who has privilege to use that 
privilege to speak up for those 
who are in a tough situation.”

Beyond the event itself, 

University alum Jessica Hicks 
added a link to the Facebook 
event for a Google Doc sign-
up sheet so that individuals 
could walk anyone home who 
felt uncomfortable after the 
protest.

PROTEST
From Page 1A


With the clock winding down 

in the final minute of the first half, 
senior guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. got the ball in transition. He 
drew two defenders at midcourt 
before dishing the ball to Zak 
Irvin, who finished a wide-open 
layup with ease.

The senior guard’s basket 

marked the Michigan basketball 
team’s last points of the half and 
capped off a 13-0 run for the 
Wolverines over the final 3:47.

After 
stringing 
together 

those points, Michigan carried a 
43-32 lead into halftime Sunday 
at Crisler Center. And the 
Wolverines wouldn’t relinquish 
their lead in the second half, 
keeping their foot on the pedal 
the rest of the way en route to 
a 77-65 victory against IUPUI 
in the 2K Classic’s Ann Arbor 
regional.

Early in the half, there weren’t 

many defensive stops to go 
around, as both teams traded 
baskets for the first five minutes. 
In 
the 
five 
that 
followed, 

though, Michigan (2-0) looked 

vulnerable.

The 
Wolverines’ 
offense 

sputtered, as they were forced 
to settle for shots from the 
perimeter with the shot clock 
winding down. The Jaguars 
(0-2), on the other hand, kept 
building an early lead.

Then, 
redshirt 
sophomore 

forward 
DJ 
Wilson 
gave 

Michigan its wake-up call. With 
roughly nine minutes left in the 
half, Walton’s transition layup 
clanged off the rim.

But 
Wilson 
was 
there, 

grabbing the rebound with two 
hands and throwing it down for a 
put-back dunk. The slam brought 
the Wolverines within one after 
they trailed by as much as seven 
during the stretch.

The Wolverines’ offense came 

out of its funk from there — going 
on a 14-point barrage catalyzed 
by four 3-pointers — kick-
starting their run that would end 
the half.

The 
dunk 
was 
just 
a 

microcosm of Wilson’s impact 
for Michigan. Though he scored 
just 7 points, Wilson cleaned up 
on the boards, finishing with 14 
rebounds in 30 minutes.

In the second half, Michigan 

went into cruise control, and 
it was a decision it could have 
ended 
up 
regretting. 
The 

Wolverines led by as many as 19 
points, but their smallest lead of 
the half was by a margin of just 
nine.

Still, they let IUPUI hang 

around. And with the way 
Darrell Combs was playing, that 
wasn’t a good idea. The Jaguars’ 
guard finished with a game-high 
22 points — pouring in 15 in the 
first half — and shot 10-for-16 
from the field.

Combs looked like a man 

on a mission. But fortunately 
for Michigan, it had plenty of 
firepower of its own. Four players 
— junior guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman, 
sophomore 

forward Moritz Wagner, Walton 
and Irvin — finished with 
double-digit scoring.

Walton and Irvin combined 

for 
28 
points 
on 
9-for-21 

shooting, while Wagner added 13 
of his own.

The 
Wolverines 
may 
not 

always be able to outscore teams, 
though. Allowing IUPUI to hang 
around didn’t matter. But against 
any other team, it could prove 
costly.

again with just less than four 
minutes to play.

Speight threw a bullet to 

Chesson, who was streaking 
along the right sideline, but the 
ball was snatched away by Iowa 
cornerback Manny Rugamba for a 
momentum-shifting interception. 

Stribling matched the pick 

soon after, but with the Wolverine 
offense unable to find a rhythm, it 
was not enough to carry Michigan 
to victory. Michigan went three-
and-out, and Iowa got the ball 
back with 1:23 on the clock.

“We didn’t make enough plays 

to extend drives and convert first 
downs, and we missed some deep 
throws,” Harbaugh said. “Give 
Iowa credit, they tackled, they 
blocked, they played a very good 
football game, so congratulate 
them and move on.”

Michigan managed only a 

field goal in the first 20 minutes 
of play, but Iowa couldn’t even 
muster that. On a drive that 
stayed alive after punter Ron 
Coluzzi improbably drew two 

straight running-into-the-kicker 
penalties on fourth down, kicker 
Miguel Recinos missed a 46-yard 
field goal attempt.

With both teams struggling 

as the first half progressed, it 
seemed 
like 
the 
Wolverines 

might escape. On Michigan’s 
third drive of the game, fifth-
year senior wide receiver Jehu 
Chesson caught a 29-yard pass 
down the center of the field to 
Iowa’s 20-yard line. It set up for 
redshirt junior Ty Isaac’s seven-
yard touchdown run that made it 
10-0, Michigan.

The 
Hawkeyes 
finally did 

get on the board, though, after 
Coluzzi pinned the Wolverines 
on their own 2-yard line with 
a 54-yard punt. Iowa defensive 
lineman Jaleel Johnson hit senior 
running back De’Veon Smith in 
the end zone for a safety on the 
second play of the ensuing drive.

An 
unnecessary 
roughing 

call 
on 
redshirt 
sophomore 

defensive tackle Bryan Mone 
gave the Hawkeyes a first down 
on Michigan’s 9-yard line with 
just under three minutes until 
the break. It proved to be a costly 
error, as running back Akrum 
Wadley found open space to catch 

a 3-yard touchdown pass.

The second half didn’t start 

any better than the first for the 
Wolverines. On the punt return, 
fifth-year senior tight end Khalid 
Hill fumbled the ball on the 
15-yard line right in front of the 
Iowa sideline, and the Hawkeyes 
were able to take the lead off of a 
25-yard field goal.

For the first time all season, 

Michigan trailed in the fourth 
quarter. 

“One of the things we had 

to do was make sure that they 
didn’t score,” said senior safety 
Dymonte 
Thomas 
about 
the 

second half’s defense. “If they 
don’t score, we win.”

The Hawkeyes handed the 

Wolverines their first loss of the 
season, 
damaging 
Michigan’s 

hopes of a College Football Playoff 
appearance. It may have taken 
until mid-November, but the 
Wolverines proved to be mortal.

After the game, Harbaugh 

was asked how hard it was to go 
undefeated.

“It’s difficult,” he said. “But not 

insurmountable.”

With just two undefeated FBS 

teams left in the nation, Saturday 
proved just how difficult it is.

control over both chambers of 
the legislature and the White 
Housefor the first time since 1928.

“It’s really scary to know now 

that Republicans have everything. 
I think that’s really scary to 
Democrats — and all of us — 
because now he can get stuff done 
we didn’t think would be able 
to happen,” she said. “It’s really 
scary to see the policies that would 
happen since it would affect all of 
us.”

Climate change

Under 
President 
Barack 

Obama, the U.S. played a large 
role in the Paris Agreement, the 
most comprehensive international 
climate change agreement, passed 
in Paris in December 2015. If the 
deal is adhered to by 174 nations 
and the European Union that 
signed, temperature rises should 
be limited to 2 degrees Celsius. 
While Trump could not reverse 
the deal, he could still undermine 
the agreement by failing to meet 
the goals set for carbon limitations 
in the U.S.

Trump has previously stated 

during the campaign that he does 
not believe climate change is a real 
phenomenon, and that he would 
end U.S. participation in the Paris 
agreement.

LSA freshman Corey Lipton 

said early Wednesday morning 
that he fears Trump’s actions will 
negatively impact generations to 
come if he fails to fight to lower 
carbon emissions.

“What’s more important is the 

long-term outcomes that Trump 
will cause,” he said. “First and 
foremost, the worst impact of this 
is going to be climate change. The 
damage that will be done in the 
next four years for the climate 
will be irreversible and will be 
noticed for the next hundreds of 
thousands of years. That’s just the 
tip of the iceberg of the damage 
that has been done tonight.”

Mark 
Barteau, 
director 
of 

the UM Energy Institute and 
professor of advanced energy 
research, said Trump’s election is 
a step backward from the progress 
made over the past several decades 
toward 
combatting 
climate 

change.

“I think it is a huge setback,” 

he said. “This level of cooperation 
that we saw in Paris was 40 years 
in the making. That potentially 
can be disrupted overnight. We 
are running out of time. Even with 
the track we are on, it would be 
difficult to stay below 2 degrees, 
so I would say it’s a tragedy.”

Women’s issues

Throughout 
the 
campaign, 

Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump 
highlighted her commitment to 
improving access to childcare 
and promoting women’s rights. 
However, Trump himself has 
contrasted some of those stances 
by suggesting abortion should be 
illegal and making lewd comments 
about touching women without 
their consent on a tape released in 
October.

Many 
women 
have 
also 

said they are concerned about 
access to birth control due to 
the stances both Trump and his 
Vice President-elect Mike Pence 
have taken during the campaign. 
During his tenure as governor of 
Indiana, Pence worked to defund 
Planned Parenthood and restrict 
access to abortions.

LSA 
freshman 
Marianne 

Drysdale said she is afraid the 
progress Planned Parenthood has 
made will be undone under the 
Trump administration. 

“I am a woman and I have 

worked for Planned Parenthood 
for two years, and I am really 
worried that all of that is going to go 
down the drain,” she said. “Trump 
is nominating a Supreme Court 
justice, and I’m disappointed that 
this percentage of the country 

is OK with a president who is 
outwardly bigoted.”

Cutbacks 
on 
Planned 

Parenthood 
would 
severely 

impact women of lower economic 
status, Social Work Prof. Kristin 
Seefeldt said, by restricting access 
to their services such as breast and 
cervical cancer screenings.

“It’s pretty likely that in the 

near future we will see dramatic 
cuts in the federal funding that 
Planned Parenthood receives,” 
she said. “I think that would have 
devastating 
effects 
on 
young 

women and women of lower 
socioeconomic status who really 
depend on the organization not 
just for birth control but for basic 
health services.”

The economy

According to data from The 

Michigan Daily’s election survey, 
the nation’s economy was one 
of the most important issues to 
students during the campaign. 
However, it is currently unclear 
Trump’s economic plan would 
entail.

The 
idea 
of 
trickle-down 

economics, 
which 
was 

popularized during the Reagan 
administration and is part of 
Trump’s plan, revolves around 
the theory that higher tax cuts for 
the wealthy will benefit the lower 
classes as that money is reinvested 
in the economy.

According to Donald Grimes, 

economist at the University’s 
Institute for Research on Labor, 
Employment, and the Economy, 
there is no strong evidence that 
trickle-down economics works 
better than social programs to 
stimulate the middle class, a key 
directive in the plan outlined by 
Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton.

“There is not really strong 

evidence at the national level,” 
he said. “On average the low tax 
states do a little bit better, but not 
a lot. It’s not going to move the 
needle a great deal either way.”

Grimes also noted that because of 

the lack of very wealthy individuals 
in Michigan will mean the state 
won’t see many benefits from this 
policy, aside from a marginal boost 
to the auto industry.

“Michigan doesn’t have a lot of 

the rich,” he said. “So it would be 
a little bit below the U.S. average, 
but that would maybe provide 
some money for people to buy cars, 
so that might benefit Michigan.”

On the other hand, Seefeldt 

said the high chance of cutbacks 
on 
social 
welfare 
programs 

will be detrimental to lower 
socioeconomic status Americans.

“I worry a lot about what the 

consequences of Trump’s victory 
and both houses of Congress being 
controlled by Republicans will be 
for lower income families,” she 
said. “We are going to see cutbacks 
in the public safety net that is 
already pretty frayed as it is.”

LSA junior Lauren Gallagher, 

president 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of Students for Hillary, 
wrote in an email interview that 
the most important economic 
issue for students is debt, noting 
that Trump has not outlined a 
comprehensive plan addressing 
higher education reform, leaving 
many students concerned.

“The most pressing economic 

issue for most college graduates 
is college loan debt, an issue that 
Trump never mentioned or took 
a stance on during his campaign, 
so I have little hope that high 
rates will refinanced and that 
skyrocketing tuition prices will be 
addressed,” she wrote.

Immigration

One of the most prominent 

rallying 
cries 
of 
Trump’s 

campaign was the promise for 
tighter immigration laws, notably 
including his plan to build a 
wall on the border between the 
United States and Mexico. Trump 
has additionally called for mass 
deportations of undocumented 
immigrants, 
an 
end 
to 
the 

acceptance 
of 
refugees 
from 

countries like Syria and a ban on 
all Muslim immigration.

Silvia Pedraza, professor of 

sociology and American culture, 
said the worst-case scenario on 
immigration would be if Trump 
followed through on all of his 
campaign promises, which she 
believes he is likely to attempt to 
do.

“The 
worst-case 
scenario 

is if Trump does fulfill all his 
campaign promises,” she said. “If 
he makes good on all of them the 
next four years will be terrible … 
and he has said he will make good 
on all of them.”

Pedraza also charged that 

Trump’s penchant for blaming 
the misfortunes of the working 
class on minorities fueled his rise 
to power.

“He has scapegoated some 

people that are very vulnerable,” 
she said. “He has demonized them 
and put his finger on them and 
has told these people that what is 
wrong with your life is because of 
them. That’s what Hitler did with 
the Jews in Nazi Germany … once 
you do that it seems that a lot of 
people either believe it or do not 
oppose it.”

Gallagher 
wrote 
Trump’s 

plans do not reflect the values of 
students 
who 
overwhelmingly 

supported Clinton throughout the 
election season.

“As we saw with the high 

number 
of 
millennials 
who 

supported Hillary Clinton in 
the polls on Tuesday, we are a 
generation that values diversity 
and believes that a diverse country 
that supports all peoples is 
strongest,” she wrote. “President-
elect Trump’s immigration plan 
stands in stark contrast to these 
ideals. Trump wants to deport 
large numbers of undocumented 
immigrants who call America 
home, he wants to severely restrict 
refugee resettlement and he wants 
to seal our Southern border in an 
unrealistic fashion.”

This lack of support, Pedraza 

noted, could lead to backlash if 
these policies take effect, given 
the protests against Trump that 
have already taken place.

“I think we are already seeing 

a backlash, young students and 
people in cities saying ‘this is not 
our president,’ ” she said. “I think 
there will be genuine protests 
from the part of many people in 
this country.”

Nonetheless, not all students 

are concerned about the abilities 
of the Trump administration. LSA 
junior Enrique Zalamea, president 
of the University’s chapter of 
College Republicans, wrote in an 
email interview with the Daily he 
believes Trump will work to pass 
legislation to benefit the country.

Considering policies moving 

forward, Zalamea wrote he hopes 
Trump will act on a number of 
issues, including a bipartisan 
effort on gun control.

“Recently, Trump proposed 

new gun control policies, which 
were incredibly conciliatory and 
bipartisan,” he wrote. “If this 
brand of sensible diplomacy is 
any indication of Trump’s policy 
record going forward, then the 
only thing stopping us from 
achieving progress is the ignorant 
stigma behind supporting Donald 
Trump — of which we have 
unfortunately seen in spades on 
this campus.”

Zalamea 
added 
that 
he 

thinks the presidency will be a 
successful one.

“Right now the Republican 

establishment is extending the 
olive branch to the American 
people, and if we continue down 
this track I expect great things 
from Mr. Trump’s presidency,” 
he wrote. “That’s the kind of 
president we need after the 
political gridlock in Washington 
and the slow economic grind 
we’ve been having for the past 
eight years.”

data graphs of grades for specific 
classes and compare the grade 
distribution of one class to 
another. 
However, 
according 

to 
Economics 
Prof. 
Dmitriy 

Stolyarov, it is hard to attribute 
departmental grading policies to 
any overarching policies since 
grading is almost entirely at 
the discretion of the individual 
professor.

“Generally, 
the 
grading 

methodology 
is 
up 
to 
the 

instructor — this is one of the 
principles underlying academic 
freedom,” 
Stolyarov 
said. 

“Accordingly, there may be as 
many grading methodologies as 
there are teachers. These data 
are no big secret — every syllabus 
has a detailed description of how 
grades are determined.”

Grading 
practices, 
because 

they are decided by professors, 
are best evaluated by review of 
historical syllabi. However, based 
off the FOIA data, there are some 
macro-level conclusions that can 
be made about the difficulty or 
typical grades in a specific class.

STEM classes compared with 

humanities and social science 
classes

Students taking classes in 

STEM fields tend to receive 
lower grades, on average, than 
those majoring in social science 
and humanities fields, according 
to the data obtained by the Daily, 
which shows the historic grade 
distribution for all LSA courses 
for Fall 2014-Fall 2015.

As shown by the data, the 

average grades given to students 
in math, physics, chemistry and 
biology classes equates to a 3.1578 

GPA. These STEM departments 
are among the most popular 
math and science departments 
offered by LSA.

In 
these 
departments, 

according to a 2009 study on 
grade inflation at the University 
of Michigan by former University 
Ph.D. student Alexandra Achen 
and Paul Courant, a professor 
of public policy and economics, 
the average GPAs are, in part, 
a reflection on the number of 
prerequisite courses.

“Strikingly, all of the low-

grading departments at Michigan 
have large required courses,” 
Achen 
and 
Courant 
wrote. 

“Math, 
physics, 
economics, 

biology, 
and 
chemistry 
are 

consistently among the lowest-
grading departments, and each 
has courses that are required 
for courses of study necessary 
for the professional ambitions of 
large numbers of students.”

In 
comparison, 
the 
class 

data also showed the average 
grades 
earned 
by 
students 

taking 
economics, 
political 

science, 
psychology, 
English, 

communications and philosophy 
courses — all humanities and 
social sciences departments — 
were equal to a GPA of 3.3793. 
This 
range 
between 
STEM 

and 
humanities 
and 
social 

sciences averages of 0.2215 is the 
difference between a B and a B+ 
average.

However, in the study, Achen 

and 
Courant 
were 
hesitant 

to attribute this solely to the 
quantitative nature of STEM 
courses.

They also noted that students 

enrolled 
in 
English 
125, 
a 

large 
introductory 
English 

composition course, averaged 
lower than other English level 

classes. This, they argued, is 
because of the types of students 
enrolled in this class — which, 
according to Achen and Courant, 
is because there is a large number 
of students enrolled who will not 
go on to become English majors.

Another possible factor for 

the apparent difficulty of STEM 
classes is the commonly used 
factors that determine grades in 
these classes.

Biology Prof. Trisha Wittkopp 

who taught the popular pre-
med course Biology 171, Intro to 
Ecology and Evolution, said she 
used a formulaic grading method 
for students determined through 
points 
earned 
from 
exams, 

discussion section preparation 
and participation, quizzes and 
iClicker scores, and does not 
round up. 

For classes like Wittkopp’s, 

she said, grades are determined 
by performance on largely non-
subjective 
examinations 
and 

are reflections on test taking 
acumen, 
rather 
than 
more 

qualitative 
assessments 
like 

argumentative essays she said 
are 
common 
to 
non-STEM 

classes.

Introductory 
level 
classes 

compared 
with 
upper 
level 

classes

The class data also suggests 

upper-level classes have higher 
grades 
in 
comparison 
with 

introductory level classes. 

The trend holds true across 

most departments and academic 
disciplines. Among 10 popular 
and 
academically 
diverse 

departments at the University, 
the average GPA of 100-level 
courses is 3.2613.

Let’s grieve, let’s fight

T

he first time I remember 
it happening, I was 
standing on the rooftop 

of the Cathedral in Santiago 
de Compostela in Spain. I 
had just finished a 600-mile 
solo pilgrimage, in which I 
walked from Seville in the 
south of Spain to Santiago in 
the northwestern corner over 
the course of six weeks. I was 
taking a tour of the Cathedral 
of Santiago and on this tour 
you are permitted to walk 
along the rooftop and view the 
old city below. One minute, I 
am simply standing on top of 
this cathedral, the next, the 
building is crumbling around 
me and I am falling to my death. 

I imagined this, of course, 

as I am still here to write 
this. The point is to illustrate 
what is called an “intrusive 
thought,” one of five diagnostic 
criteria 
for 
Post-Traumatic 

Stress Disorder, a disorder I 
was diagnosed with in October 
2015. This news came to me 
nearly four years after the first 
time I was raped, and only nine 
months after the most recent 
episode of sexual assault. 

In total, I have been raped 

four times. Only one of which 
happened 
while 
I 
was 
a 

student. All of which happened 
with people I knew. None of 
which happened in a dark 
alley behind a dumpster or 
while I was unconscious from 
drinking. The sad truth is 
that this is the reality of rape. 
Sexual violence against women 
is largely not committed by 
strangers at gunpoint as the 
media would like us to believe. 
It is committed in the safety 
of our own homes by those we 
know and trust. 

My 
story 
is 
about 
the 

aftermath of rape. What happens 
to survivors after the fact is 
so often ignored, minimized 
with a blanket statement or 
sensationalized when someone 
is brave enough to speak out 
about it (take the Stanford Rape 
Case). The truth is, though, that 
our suffering doesn’t end when 
the trauma stops, it is only the 
beginning. The truth is, not all 
of us have witnesses. The truth 
is, rape is a contest of “he said, 
she said” and more often than 

not, what she says is denied 
its own validity. The truth is, 
reporting these crimes isn’t 
taken seriously. The truth is, 
Brock Turner only spent three 
months in jail for being caught in 
the act of raping an unconscious 
woman. The truth is, rape causes 
so many of us to suffer so much 
more after the physical act than 
the world cares to know. The 
truth is, unfortunately, that 
survivors of sexual assault often 
suffer in silence.

PTSD is a mental disorder 

that I have to carry daily. For the 
six months after my pilgrimage, 
I lived (and still live) with 
intrusive thoughts, among other 
things. I envisioned myself being 
hit by a bus each time I crossed 
the road. I would walk into the 
bathroom and imagine that my 
roommate would be dead in the 
bathtub. Waiting at the bus stop, 
I expected to be shot down by a 
drive-by gunman. This was so 
common that I thought it was 
normal. I thought to myself, 
“the worst thing has already 
happened, so of course I imagine 
all these terrible things all the 
time.” I didn’t think I needed 
help; it just made sense that the 
world was a terrifying place.

These 
are 
the 
milder 

symptoms 
of 
PTSD; 
others 

include 
flashbacks, 
mind 

and 
body 
disassociation, 

avoidance 
of 
activities 
and 

places, hypervigilance, general 
disinterest, 
disabling 
panic 

attacks caused by severe anxiety 
and depression spotted with 
suicidal episodes. I call PTSD 
my “invisible disability,” always 
there but never seen. I am able 
to function highly in daily life; 
I remain employed and in a 
healthy, long-term relationship, 
but my life is permeated with 
a constant feeling of fear and I 
struggle with a severe mental 
illness that only those closest to 
me witness.

In 
some 
sense, 
having 

PTSD is like living as though 
you are dying. Your body 
is constantly on high alert, 
ready to take action against 
any 
danger, 
triggering 
the 

fight, flight or freeze response 
almost constantly. However, 
this becomes exhausting and 
disabling when simply standing 
at the bus stop is perceived as a 
true threat.

I have been in a cognitive 

behavioral therapy program 

for a year now. I’ve tried three 
different medication cocktails, 
of which one made me deeply 
suicidal and another made me 
gain 45 pounds in six months. 
My mind and body have finally 
settled on a combination of 
Zoloft, Abilify and Wellbutrin. 
A medication cocktail they call 
“well-loft” because it works so 
well for those of us who need 
it to leave the house in the 
morning. PTSD has severely 
impacted 
my 
relationship, 

draining us both and sending 
us to couples therapy to cope 
with the imbalance. It has 
taken away from my ability 
to explore the world on my 
own. When I was 19, I spent 
six weeks travelling Ecuador 
alone. A year and a half ago, 
I crossed the entire country 
of Spain on foot by myself. 
Now, I’m afraid of my own 
bathroom. It’s disorienting and 
disheartening to say the least.

I 
once 
heard 
someone 

who struggles with severe 
depression 
say, 
“I 
must 

remember 
that 
my 
track 

record with bad days is 100 
percent.” I want to thank this 
girl for describing resilience 
so eloquently. No matter how 
hard things get, I stand and I 
face them. Every day, I get up 
and I shout out into the world, 
“You will not take me!” I am 
strong and I am determined to 
win my life back.

This is a battle, a battle 

against the invisible demons 
someone else handed me when 
they took away my dignity. A 
battle I must fight when I did 
nothing wrong. A battle that 
is so incredibly unfair. That 
makes me angry; it fills me 
with grief. Some days it drains 
my will to live. But every day, 
I stand and I face the battle, 
determined to win.

y now, we’ve started to 
figure out how much 
of a disaster Tuesday’s 

election 
was. 
The 

Democratic 
Party 

was served one of 
the most thorough 
defeats 
they’ve 

received 
this 
century, 
and 

the Electoral College system 
allowed Donald Trump to win 
the 
presidency. 
This 
means 

that 
a 
Republican-controlled 

House of Representatives and 
Senate will likely allow whatever 
policy proposals Donald Trump 
proposes to be easily passed.

However, as I sat crying 

and wide awake Wednesday 
morning, the tears streaming 
down my face weren’t simply due 
to the defeat of Hillary Clinton. 
The city of Detroit was handed 
an incredible defeat up and 
down the ballot — a defeat that 
certainly threatens a lot of the 
growth that has been happening 
in Detroit over the last few years.

Most 
monumentally, 
a 

surge of anti-tax Republican 
voters in the working-class 
suburbs of Macomb County 
led to the defeat of the 
Regional Transit Authority 
plan, a plan that I endorsed 
earlier in the year. This 
defeat means that low-income 
Detroit 
residents 
without 

cars must continue to endure 
the worst transit system in 
America. Additionally, any 
hopes of establishing any sort 
of commuter train service to 
Ann Arbor was defeated in 
this plan, sentencing Detroit 
to auto pollution for the 
foreseeable future.

The losses for Detroit don’t 

stop there. In one of the most 
highly contested races of the 
year, an inability of community 
groups and business leaders 
to come together led to the 
approval of proposal A and 
the defeat of proposal B, both 
designed 
to 
mandate 
that 

businesses receiving tax breaks 
enter into a legally enforceable 
contract 
with 
neighborhood 

groups 
in 
the 
surrounding 

neighborhoods. Proposal A, which 
was supported by community 
groups and was organized by 
grassroots organizations across 
the city, differed from the 
Detroit City Council-supported 
Proposal B only on the threshold 
of tax breaks.

The difference between the 

two proposals was the threshold 
that mandates the community 
benefits contract. For Proposal A, 
any contract receiving more than 
$300,000 in tax abatements would 
have to enter into a contract with 
the surrounding neighborhood. 

This proposal could be beneficial 
to 
the 
neighborhoods, 
but 

opponents argued that it would 

slow 
down 
growth 

and new development. 
Under Proposal B, the 
project would have to 
receive $1 million in 

order to be forced into the contract 
with the neighborhood — a limit 
that prevents many controversial 
developments from being forced 
into the contract. In the last 10 
years, only Little Caesars Arena 
— the Detroit Red Wings’ new 
Midtown arena — would have 
required a contract with the 
community. Once the votes were 
cast, Proposal A was defeated 

54 percent to 46 percent, while 
Proposal B passed 53 percent to 
47 percent. This is problematic 
because rather than coming to 
a middle-ground conclusion 
in which community wishes 
and 
business 
interests 
are 

respected, the debate over 
community benefits contracts 
is largely over with little to no 
change for the community.

Even races in metro Detroit 

were bad for Detroit proper. 
L. 
Brooks 
Patterson, 
long-

time Oakland County county 
executive, won his 7th term 
in charge of Detroit’s wealthy 
northern suburbs. Patterson has 
spent his entire career trying to 
keep the people of Detroit down 
in as many ways as possible. He 
came under fire for an article 
profiling him titled “Drop Dead 
Detroit!” in which he said that 
he wanted to “turn Detroit into 
an Indian reservation, where 
we herd all the Indians into the 
city, build a fence around it, and 
then throw in the blankets and 
corn.” Patterson hates Detroit 
with a burning passion, and his 
re-election only serves to strain 
city/suburb relations even more.

Detroit’s Election Day was 

terrible on the results end and on 
the voting end. Voters across the 
city faced incredible barriers to 
voting, including two-hour waits 
and broken voting machines. 
In spite of all of this, voter 
turnout was higher than in 2012, 
clocking in at 48.49 percent. 
However, even with such a high 

turnout and with 95 percent 
of the ballots cast in Detroit 
going to Hillary Clinton, Detroit 
couldn’t overcome the massive 
deficit that the rest of the state 
of Michigan dug itself in to. In 
the end, the race for Michigan 
was won by Donald Trump in 
the suburbs of Macomb County. 
This county, located northeast 
of Detroit, is the home of two 
of the largest municipalities in 
Michigan and had 67.3 percent 
of its voters cast a ballot. What 
sealed the deal for Trump was 
the appeal of “America first” 
to the county’s white, working 
class voters, with 53.6 percent of 
the normally Democratic county 
casting their ballots for Trump.

Because 
of 
this 
election, 

Detroit faces unique problems. In 
addition to the disastrous “Urban 
Renewal” proposals — including a 
reinstatement of unconstitutional 
“stop and frisk” policies to 
attempt to reduce crime in 
urban areas — Trump’s wild 
economic 
proposals 
threaten 

the industries that make all of 
southeast Michigan work. On the 
state level, the Michigan House 
of Representatives and Michigan 
Senate are as Republican as ever, 
and Gov. Rick Snyder still holds 
power, even after his shameful 
and possibly illegal handling of 
the Flint water crisis. Republicans 
in Lansing can continue to not 
care about Michigan’s urban 
centers like usual, only this time, 
there is no end in sight.

In all honesty, this wasn’t just 

Donald Trump’s fault. It wasn’t 
the state Republican Party’s fault. 
It wasn’t the racist L. Brooks 
Patterson’s fault either. It wasn’t 
even the fault of the Macomb 
County Trump voters who turned 
out to the polls like never before. 
This election was a failure on 
all levels to prioritize the needs 
of cities like Detroit. Everyone 
— Republican or Democrat — is 
responsible for the tragedy that 
fell upon Detroit this election. 

Only by getting real with one 

another about the real issue 
facing America’s cities can we 
hope to move forward. Detroit, 
and other cities, are real places 
filled with real people, and I 
hope that the cities of the future 
aren’t places that have been 
forgotten by political leaders and 
suburbanites alike. For now, this 
election leaves a dark shadow 
over Detroit, and the years of 
inequality and pain won’t go 
away soon. A solution must be 
found — the future of Detroit 
depends on it.

MADELINE NOWICKI | OP-ED

A

s my friends and I 
watched the numbers 
on FiveThirtyEight and 

CNN’s coverage tick toward a 
Donald Trump victory, we tried 
to hold back our tears. I watched 
the evening unfold with a group 
of young women around me — 
all from different backgrounds, 
all brought together because we 
were hoping, desperately, that 
love and compassion and reason 
would win.

I was frightened for my 

bodily autonomy because of the 
normalization of sexual assault 
and degrading violence against 
women exhibited in Trump’s 
rhetoric. Another friend was 
concerned for her immigrant 
parents, who came to this 
country in search of liberty and 
equality, and were now facing 
racism and legislation designed 
to destroy everything they have 
worked for, from their small 
businesses to their family’s 
health care. Another friend was 
concerned that LGBTQ rights 
were being stripped away by 
ideology that believes there’s 
only one way to fit into the 
American narrative.

Friends 
called, 
texted, 

FaceTimed, 
tweeted, 
posted, 

shared and reached out because 
they were crying and didn’t 
understand how the America 
we have known since we were 10 
years old could betray us like this. 
The mood fluctuated between 
anxiety so bad it caused vomiting, 
to anger and frustration at the 

progress we were losing, to 
abject despair and loss of faith in 
our nation’s structure and in our 
fellow Americans.

We were together, though, 

and love did win the popular 
vote, if not the structural vote. 
The singular thing preventing 
me from hopelessness is the 
knowledge 
that 
millions 
of 

Americans felt the same way 
I did that night, and the same 
way I continue to feel today. The 
single thing bringing me hope 
right now is the notion that we 
can come together — those of 
us hurting and terrified — and 
make a difference by caring for 
each other, especially women, 
people 
of 
color, 
religious 

minorities, 
LGBTQ 
people, 

disabled folks and every other 
group Trump has demeaned and 
denigrated every day.

I 
can’t 
understand 
any 

other way to make sense of 
these results than to work 
harder than I ever have in 
my life to ensure our country 
works toward common sense, 
compassion, reason and justice 
for all Americans and American 
citizens. I know that millions 
of us exist, and we need to do 
this work. Young people, your 
vote mattered. Young voters in 
Michigan, your vote mattered 
so, so dearly. Young people, 
take your time to grieve and be 
exhausted and feel defeated. 
And then know that once you 
have processed this in your own 
way, now is the time to act.

Come together with us. We 

need to build our coalition, 
support each other through non-

governmental means, advocate 
for 
one 
another, 
practice 

compassionate and unfearing 
alliance and try desperately to 
fight against the horrific actions 
and sentiments of this man. 
I am so disappointed and so 
frightened and so upset. I am 
also so determined to find the 
good folks in this community, 
and to build this community 
and fight the good fight every 
single day. Not for myself, but 
for every single boy and girl 
and person of color and LGBTQ 
person and differently abled 
and Muslim person I know and 
every other person who will 
have their rights and dignity 
tested by this man’s disgusting 
and thoughtless policies.

I am disgusted and horrified 

and upset, and I know this 
feeling is powerful. Let’s harness 
this power. Let’s turn out in 
record numbers to volunteer 
for organizations supporting 
refugees, reproductive rights, 
minority rights and more. Let’s 
turn out in record numbers 
to 
protest 
discriminatory 

policies. Let’s turn out in record 
numbers to vote in 2018 and 
infuse the Senate, the House of 
Representatives and the state 
assemblies and governorships 
with love, tolerance and dignity. 
Let’s turn out in record numbers 
in 2020 to renounce violence 
and despair and racism. Let’s not 
give in. Let’s grieve, let’s fight 
and let’s not let this moment go 
to waste.

To say that “Moonlight” is 

a movie about one single thing 
would be to misunderstand it 
fundamentally. At its crux, the 
film is about a boy 
growing up poor, 
Black 
and 
gay. 

But it’s also about 
drug 
addiction 

and 
poverty. 
It’s 

about the fragile 
frame that holds 
up 
collective 

expectations 
of 

manhood, and the 
ways those expectations are both 
challenged and reinforced by the 
men who don’t quite fit within 
their bounds. It’s about love. It’s 
about identity. It’s about humanity. 
Surprisingly, it tells all this in two 
hours.

The film — adapted from 

Tarell Alvin McCraney’s play 
“In Moonlight Black Boys Look 
Blue”— follows Chiron through 
three chapters in his life, each 
titled after a different name Chiron 
is given: Little, Chiron, Black.

Chiron is expertly played by 

newcomer Alex Hibbert, Ashton 
Sanders (“The Retrieval”) and 
Trevante Rhodes (“If Loving 
You Is Wrong”) in each of these 
chapters. Each actor captures 
the essence of Chrion, giving the 
film the illusion of a “Boyhood”-

esque structure. They don’t feel 
like three separate actors playing 
one character, they feel like one 
man, each one growing into the 
next and molded from who he was 
before.

In “Little,” the first chapter 

of the story, Chiron meets Juan 

(Mahershala 
Ali, 

“Luke Cage”) a drug 
dealer who serves 
as a father figure 
and role model. He 
takes Chiron to the 
ocean and teaches 
him 
to 
swim, 

simultaneously 
lifting him up and 
letting him go. And 

even though he is only in the first 
chapter, Juan’s influence is felt in 
every frame. 

The precision of the film is 

astounding. 
Director 
Barry 

Jenkins 
(“Medicine 
for 

Melancholy”) 
knows 
exactly 

when to keep his camera close 
and exactly when to pull away. 
Silence, noise and white noise 
are mixed to completely upend 
viewers’ expectations for and 
understandings of Chiron’s world. 
We’re both inside Chiron’s head 
and far away from him, knowing 
him only as far as he lets himself 
be known.

Every scene, every frame is 

important. I could point to any 
one shot and call it equally the 
most heartbreaking or the most 
uplifting moment in the film. 

That’s what makes “Moonlight” so 
difficult to write about. It knows 
exactly what it wants to be, and it 
is it. It knows exactly what it wants 
to say, and it says it.

On 
paper, 
many 
of 
the 

characters 
risk 
becoming 

stereotypes 
of 
this 
sort 
of 

narrative — the drug-addicted 
mother, 
the 
criminal 
father 

figure. The characters break free 
from those bounds not because 
the film intends to overturn 
expectations, but because it isn’t 
interested in them at all. Naomie 
Harris (“Spectre”) carves herself 
a heart-wrenching arc out of 
only a handful of scenes as 
Chiron’s junkie mother, Paula. 
Jenkins saves his characters 
from dehumanization because 
he does not make them symbols. 
Any feelings of universality come 
from the fact that what they share 
with their audience is humanity. 

Just like “Moonlight” is not 

the sum of its parts, no character 
is the sum of their facts. Deaths 
and prison sentences that happen 
between chapters are mentioned 
only in passing. Part of what makes 
the characters so human is the fact 
that their lives continue even when 
we aren’t watching. 

“Moonlight” is equal parts 

heartbreaking and hopeful, but not 
in the sense that those two factors 
even each other out. Instead it digs 
until it finds hope in the heartbreak 
and it stays there. Simply put, it’s a 
perfect movie.

COMMUNITY CULTURE INTERVIEW

Athi-Patra Ruga is no stranger 

to national turmoil. His home 
country of South Africa has often 
seen attention for its contentious 
politics, frequent protests and 
slowly healing racial divisions. 
But this year, the West has 
experienced its own political 
turmoil — and Ruga was there 
to see it. A work trip to Europe 
this June placed the artist in the 
epicenter of protest and anxiety 
over the Brexit vote, in which 
the United Kingdom decided to 
pull out of the European Union. 
And now, here in Ann Arbor 
for a Penny Stamps lecture last 
week, Ruga had the opportunity 
to witness one of the strangest 
and most divisive periods in 
American history. He arrived 
just before Election Day, and 
watched firsthand as a liberal 
college town convulsed from the 
inside out.

“I have the honor of always 

being away from home when all 
these major reactionary things 
happen,” he said in a phone 
interview Wednesday. “I was in 
Denmark when Brexit happened, 
and then now I’m here for — 
this.”

This “right place, right time” 

attitude may be no coincidence. 
At the core of Ruga’s work are 
these divisions that have come to 
characterize modern life, as well 
as the increasingly blurred lines 
that make easy categorization 
— between races, countries, 
even 
genders 
— 
impossible 

today. The chaotic color and 
pageantry of politics merges 
with media, art, even reality 
TV to create an immersive 
experience for his viewer that 
seeks to imitate and mirror, yet 
also to challenge the validity of 
the “real” world around them. 
This riot of visual stimulation is 
often overwhelming, but never 
without purpose or intent.

After 
all, 
contemporary 

culture is just as dizzying as the 
alternative realities, the utopias, 
that Ruga whips up in galleries 
and museums around the world. 
Ruga’s eclectic constructions, on 
the other hand, cause viewers 
to question their reality, though 
it’s up to the visitor to sort out 
exactly what it all means — and 
that’s okay.

“I start speaking to people 

in a way that is beyond the 

pedagogical, didactic — you 
know, those big words,” he said 
with a wry laugh. “I need to 
immerse people whereby they 
somehow feel they can’t escape it. 
For me it boils down to speaking 
about alternative realities, and 
the process by which alternative 
realities are built.That’s how 
politics are born: we all want to 
create a new world.”

In many ways, this critical, 

considered 
attitude 
toward 

cultural constructions developed 
through Ruga’s childhood in a 
rapidly changing South Africa, a 
country with a history that both 
intersects with and diverges from 
the United States in key aspects, 
from the legacy of racism to 
debates over colonization. For 
Ruga, the major difference in 
the politics of the two countries 
is that the memory of legal 
racism has slowly faded for some 
Americans, becoming politically 
stale and ceasing to have the same 
degree of power over the votes of 
citizens who do not experience 
discrimination directly.

“We 
have 
such 
a 
recent 

memory of (racism) that our 
parents really still have those 
raw stories of apartheid, of the 
movement. We can never take 
it for granted — and that’s why 
we’re such a politically minded 
youth,” he said. “There are many 
South Africas as well. I come 
from the South Africa that is 
always reminded of the cost at 
which freedom came ... for us, 
the power of voting is something 
that is totally inculcated into us. 
We know that voting is such a 
powerful thing; it has changed 
our world. So we will not ever let 
go of that.”

In other ways, though, Ruga 

sees himself as a global citizen, 
something that has influenced 
his work as much if not more 
than the nationality listed on 
his passport. He came of age in 
the 1980s and 1990s, a turbulent 
time for South Africa which 
saw it not only undergoing a 
democratic transition, but also 
fully emerging onto the global 
stage for the first time since the 
walls of apartheid went up in the 
late 1940s. Along with this came 
unprecedented access to world 
media, which had long been 
censored and limited by low 
access to modern technology. 
Like 
previous 
generations, 

Ruga was raised on the classic 
TV program “Good Morning 
South Africa,” but also on MTV 

and nightly news from all over 
the globe. One of his earliest 
memories is watching the Berlin 
Wall 
crumble 
during 
1989 

protests.

“That memory stuck in my 

head — that people actually could 
break down, literally, borders, 
and step across. And this was 
also coming at a time when our 
borders 
were 
falling,” 
Ruga 

explained. “So I think that I’ve 
always had this idea of daring 
to go where I’m told not to go, 
either by history or marketing or 
society.”

Though he grew up in a highly 

literary family — his father was 
a journalist and editor — not all 
Ruga’s media influences were 
“highbrow.” Ruga takes pride in 
the many references to popular 
culture, particularly fashion and 
reality TV, that abound in his art. 
He revels in the sense of sacrilege, 
of blasphemy, that this creates 
in the traditional conception 
of high art, something that has 
been dominated both by certain 
types of people and certain types 
of worldviews for a long time.

“It’s 
disruption. 
We 
are 

living in an age whereby truly 
defining what high art is no 
longer (clear),” he said. “I love 
art that is in the hands of the 
people. It shakes up a very static, 
patriarchal, man-centered thing. 
Saying that all these things that 
are ‘low art’ are ‘high art,’ I’m 
basically disrupting a centuries-
old idea of creation, which we 
have seen is not good because it 
starts isolating people of certain 
colors, women and social classes. 
I take pleasure in still knowing 
that it disrupts.”

Ruga sees this tendency in the 

art world as well as in the wider 
world, including politics in both 
South Africa and the United 
States. 
“Populist” 
candidates 

have 
becoming 
increasingly 

prevalent in both countries, with 
both Jacob Zuma, President of 
South Africa, and newly-chosen 
President-elect Donald Trump 
gaining their base support by 
appealing 
to 
working-class 

citizens and embodying the 
social values of certain sectors of 
the electorate.

Politics will continue to divide 

people based on their identities. 
Ruga’s work reminds us that 
this is far from an American 
phenomenon. After all, perhaps 
the 
United 
States 
is 
just 

becoming a little bit more like 
the rest of the world.

FILM REVIEW

Over the course of 10 episodes, 

FX’s “Better Things” has proven 
to be yet another fantastic addition 
to the canon of groundbreaking 
TV shows in this era of “peak 
TV.” Not only has 
it 
demonstrated 

skillful storytelling 
through 
the 

writing of creator 
Pamela 
Adlon 

(“King of the Hill”) 
and 
co-executive 

producer 
Louis 

C.K. (“Louie”), but 
“Better 
Things” 

has also become 
an anomaly in and 
of itself. The half-
hour sitcom captures characters 
rarely seen on television — single 
mothers, young girls and middle-
aged and elderly women — and 
depicts them in an authentic, 
thought-provoking light.

Adlon has been a particularly 

growing 
creative 
force 
since 

“Better Things” premiered in 
September. She showcases her 
comedic and dramatic talents as 
the writer and star of the show, 
playing the thick-skinned mother 
and struggling actress Sam Fox. 
In the show’s first season finale, 
“Only Women Bleed,” Adlon 
makes a compelling case for the 
underlying importance of “Better 
Things:” motherhood is difficult 
and emotionally taxing, but at the 
end of the day, it can be the most 
rewarding part of a woman’s life.

We see the ebb and flow of 

Adlon’s frustrations and triumphs 
as a matriarch in the very first 
sequence of the episode, where 
Sam plans on spending a weekend 
with her eccentric British mother, 
Phyllis (Celia Imrie, “Bridget 
Jones’s Baby”). During a long, 
uninterrupted take, Sam and 
Phyllis begin to argue to the point 
where Sam expresses that she 
doesn’t want to spend time with 
her mother. It’s a heartbreaking, 
sad moment in their already 
complicated 
relationship, 
but 

“Better Things” isn’t afraid to 

show the nitty-gritty facet of 
difficult family dynamics.

“I suck as a daughter, suck as a 

mother,” Sam laments, as she pulls 
back into her driveway.

Funnily enough, the following 

busy sequence begs to differ on 
that argument. As Sam wakes 
up her youngest, Duke (Olivia 

Edward, 
“Crazy 

Ex-Girlfriend”), 
we 
observe 
the 

controlled 
chaos 

that 
begins 
to 

ensue in the Fox 
household. 
Sam’s 

vexing 
middle 

daughter Frankie 
(Hannah Alligood, 
“Paper 
Towns”) 

and petty oldest 
Max 
(newcomer 

Mikey 
Madison) 

are fighting over clothes; her side 
piece is asking her to send him 
racy pictures; her housekeeper 
comes in late with an ache from a 
previous night of food poisoning; 
and she has to take care of some 
paperwork.

This part of the episode, 

underscored by the minimalist 
electronica of Laurie Anderson’s 
“O 
Superman,” 
is 
anxiety-

inducing to watch, but it is 
nevertheless 
paced 
extremely 

well. Thanks to Adlon’s auxiliary 
position as the episode’s director, 
she knows exactly how to show 
all the moving parts to Sam’s roles 
as mother, businesswoman and 
sexual being and the difficulty 
in 
fulfilling 
all 
those 
roles 

simultaneously. Though she is 
clearly exhausted by the end of 
it, Sam certainly doesn’t suck as 
a mother; at least she’s trying to 
make everything work, despite no 
one ever seeming to acknowledge 
her efforts.

Her 
annoyance 
continues 

when she has to bring Frankie 
out of school for the day for 
using 
the 
boy’s 
bathroom. 

During a conversation between 
the two, though, there seems 
to be a disconnect between the 
two that mirrors the emotional 
barrier between Sam and her 
own mom. Sam is upset because 
Frankie’s action and subsequent 

punishment 
has 
ruined 
her 

schedule for the day, but Frankie 
is mad about how alienating the 
girl’s bathroom is at her school. 
Both of their concerns are valid, 
but what makes “Better Things” 
great is that it neither downplays 
nor 
trivializes 
the 
complex 

relationship between mother and 
daughter.

This 
theme 
unexpectedly 

unravels into something more 
intricate and unnerving, as Max 
later tells Sam that perhaps 
Frankie is actually a boy, using her 
traumatizing experience in the 
girl’s bathroom as a cover. Max 
may not be right either, but her 
remark reveals a sobering truth 
about her daughter’s ambiguous 
gender identity, as well as the 
generational 
divide 
between 

daughters and mothers.

Sam’s 
revelation 
over 
this 

new reality for her daughters 
will most likely be discussed in 
the show’s second season — FX 
already renewed the show. But as 
troubling as it may be for Sam that 
the Fox household could have one 
less woman, “Better Things” will 
definitely portray that impending 
situation with the sensitivity it 
deserves.

That being said, the thread 

between the Fox women remains 
strong, their connection fully 
realized in the episode’s last 
sequence. While driving down 
the freeway, Sam, Max, Frankie 
and Duke sing along to the 
namesake of the episode title, Alice 
Cooper’s “Only Women Bleed.” As 
sentimental as these final moments 
are, “Better Things” does what it 
does best; it recognizes the beauty 
in the ordinary chaos of life and 
holds onto the love in a family that 
often spews hateful things at one 
another.

In the very last scene, the words 

“Dedicated to my daughters” 
appears at the bottom of the 
screen. After a heavy week that 
has tested people’s hope, love and 
patience for a country that has 
been spewing hateful things for 
a long time, it only makes sense 
that “Better Things” ends its 
phenomenal first season with such 
a triumphant, relevant message.

‘Doctor Strange’ fails as 
a superhero fantasy film

MARVEL

When the drugs hit in newly-legalized Massachusetts

At the core of cinema is 

the uniquely human desire to 
transcend our own bodies. The 
earliest films were exhibitionist 
displays of beauty and power — 
muscle-bound men performing 
athletic feats; graceful dancers 
twirling 
their 
extravagant 

skirts. Audiences 
paid to observe 
abilities and traits 
that they did not 
have themselves. 
As 
cinema 

developed, 
the 

film 
apparatus 

became 
one 
of 

voyeurism. 
We 

found 
ourselves 

watchers 
of 

secret gardens and passionate 
trysts. Capra let us in on an 
intimate 
vision 
of 
heaven; 

Hitchcock filled rooms with 
our subconscious violent and 
sexual desire.

The 
superhero 
film, 
the 

predominant cinematic pop-
cultural force, exists on a spec-
trum between exhibitionism 
and voyeurism. These films 
exhibit sexual bodies perform-
ing impossible tasks of speed 
and strength and allow us to 
both act as a voyeur to humans 
receiving impossible abilities 
and feel the emotions that come 
with such transcendence. Con-
sider the scene in which we 
jump across skyscrapers with 
Spider-Man in the first person, 
the scene when Michael B. Jor-
dan discovers his ability to fly 
and cries out to the world with 

JACOB RICH
Senior Arts Editor

joy in “Chronicle,” the scene 
where Tony Stark brutalizes his 
terrorist captors with his suit of 
armor (can we call this particu-
lar phenomenon “Bushsploita-

tion?”).

And 
on 
its 

surface, 
“Doctor 

Strange” 
seems 

to 
satisfy 
both 

spectrums 
of 
fantasy 

swimmingly. 
It 

concerns a secret 
cabal of magicians 
on the fringes of 
Eastern 
society, 

and a traumatized Western 
doctor who travels to them to 
heal his broken body. We watch 
as the laws of the unfeeling, 
indifferent universe are bent 
and broken until we understand 
that everything, not nothing, 
matters. It also presents us 
with the same type of power-
slinging, 
muscle-rippling 

combat that so satisfies us in the 
same way it did in the last eight 
Marvel Studios films, only this 
time with arcane spells instead 
of bullets, alien powers and 
mutant abilities.

But Doctor Strange, as a 

character and an idea, simply 
works better on the comic 
book page than on the screen, 
and uniquely so. Google Steve 
Ditko’s original ’60s renditions 
of Strange and observe the 
manner in which spells are 
juxtaposed 
in 
side-by-side 

frames to be digested at the 
speed the reader chooses. The 
reader (“true believer,” as Stan 
Lee would put it) is allowed an 
enormous possibility space in 

which their imagination fills in 
the gaps of the already excellent 
depiction of spacetime-bending 
magic. But when these spells are 
translated to the silver screen, 
that possibility space between 
frames is filled with … more 
frames. 24 frames per second, 
to be precise. It’s the perfect 
number of frames to simulate 
reality for the audience, as many 
filmmakers 
have 
discovered 

over the years.

This 
process 
literalizes 

magic 
to 
an 
uncomfortable 

degree. Instead of marveling 
(MARVELing?) 
at 
the 

possibility of what real-life 
magic could look like, we know 
precisely what it would look like 
— slightly above-average CGI. 
And that’s just not as exciting, 
not as effective a fantasy.

That’s 
probably 
about 

enough film student jargon 
for one review. And besides, 
this film has just as many 
problems 
grounded 
in 
the 

casually observable. My follow-
up research question is this: 
How bad do I feel for Rachel 
McAdams? This poor woman 
has had to play the most basic, 
vanilla girlfriend character in 
more films than I could possibly 
list here, though I shall now 
try: “About Time,” “Midnight 
in Paris,” “The Time Traveler’s 
Wife” (she really loves time-
traveling, doesn’t she?), “The 
Notebook,” “The Vow,” “Aloha,” 
“Southpaw.” Oh, and “Doctor 
Strange,” where she fills maybe 
the least interesting superhero 
girlfriend role I’ve ever seen. 
But then again, she was really 
good in “Spotlight,” and she has 

a lot of money. My conclusion is 
that I feel moderately bad for 
Rachel McAdams.

Though 
“Doctor 
Strange” 

as a whole is not as vanilla 
as 
McAdams’s 
character 

(Cumberbatch’s 
American 

accent is sexy, some Nolan-
esque action is good, some of 
the 
magical 
transcendence 

sequences 
are 
vaguely 

structurally 
innovative), 
it 

is merely a competent entry 
into 
the 
Marvel 
Cinematic 

Universe. 
Actually, 
it 
fails 

in certain ways that most 
other films in the MCU don’t. 
The humor is flat and stale, 
especially compared to Joss 
Whedon’s rollicking jokes in 
“The Avengers” (a Beyoncé joke 
feels like a pathetic executive 
board-manufactured 
plea 
to 

hip millennial Twitter). The 
romance 
feels 
sexless 
and 

droll compared to the gender-
neutral, broadly exploitative 
excitement found in “Captain 
America: 
Civil 
War.” 
And 

although 
they’re 
not 
MCU 

films, 
the 
superb 
slow-mo 

Quicksilver setpieces in Bryan 
Singer’s 
last 
two 
“X-Men” 

films wipe the floor with the 
climactic 
time-manipulation 

sequence in “Doctor Strange.”

“Doctor Strange” is the least 

effective Marvel Studios film 
since 2013’s “Thor: The Dark 
World.” 
“Captain 
America: 

Civil War” and even “Deadpool” 
are the better superhero films 
this year. In those films, my 
voyeuristic, 
exhibitionist 

fanwankery 
was 
satisfied. 

“Doctor 
Strange” 
left 
me 

yearning for much, much more.

OWA CITY — The eleva-
tor doors slid open, and an 
alcohol-scented roar of elation 

slipped in.

What had 

been a car 
full of quiet 
reporters 
was suddenly 
permeated by 
a smattering 
of fans in 
black and gold, 
including a 
wide-eyed, 
grinning child who was so caught 
up in the jubilee that he tried to 
jump on the elevator without his 
family. (They quickly pulled him 
back out.)

That same sea of black and 

gold had also taken over the 
stairwell, the concourse and 
the field itself, with chants of 
“LET’S GO HAWKS” shaking 
the core of Kinnick Stadium. 
The mob eventually scattered, 
and the chants faded into loud, 
celebratory choruses of Toby 
Keith’s “Red Solo Cup” in the 
stadium’s surrounding parking 
lots some 30 minutes later.

They say crazy things can 

happen at Kinnick, and the No. 3 
Michigan football team learned it 
the hard way Saturday night.

Of course, the Wolverines’ 

coach, Jim Harbaugh, already 
knew it. Thirty-one years ago, 
he was the quarterback of a No. 
2 Michigan team that rolled into 
Iowa City to face No. 1 Iowa, with 
the winner taking the driver’s seat 
for a Rose Bowl bid.

The Wolverines lost that game, 

12-10, on a last-second 29-yard 
field goal. The fans stormed the 
field in seconds and ended up 
dismantling one of the goal posts. 
Harbaugh said then, “It felt like 
someone reached in and pulled 
everything out.”

Harbaugh was on the sideline 

Saturday when history repeated 
itself. This time, it was a 33-yard 
field goal from Keith Duncan 
as the clock stuck zero — a kick 
that snapped No. 3 Michigan’s 
undefeated season and brought 
the Hawkeye faithful over the 
barricades and onto the field, this 
time to celebrate a 14-13 victory.

But this wasn’t an undefeated 

Iowa team with Rose Bowl 
aspirations — the Hawkeyes 
were 5-4 entering the game, and 

punter Ron Coluzzi might have 
been their most impactful player 
on the field Saturday.

This wasn’t a hard-fought battle 

of two dominant teams where the 
Wolverines came up just short at 
the end.

It was a lesson of what can 

happen for Michigan when 
everything goes wrong.

Earlier this season, the 

Wolverines knocked off Wisconsin 
in Ann Arbor because of redshirt 
sophomore quarterback Wilton 
Speight’s ability to throw a timely 
deep ball. His fourth-quarter 
46-yard touchdown pass to fifth-
year senior receiver Amara Darboh 
ended up being the difference in a 
14-7 win.

But Saturday, Speight 

couldn’t hit any long passes 
— he underthrew a few to 
Darboh that could have been 
intercepted, and he airmailed 
Darboh near the end zone in the 
fourth quarter on a drive where 
Michigan had to settle for a field 
goal. Even a pass that he put on 
fifth-year senior receiver Jehu 
Chesson’s hands was stripped 
away for an Iowa interception. It 
just wasn’t Speight’s night, and 

he finished with a season-low 
4.0 yards per attempt.

“Just an off night, I guess,” he 

said. “(The passing game) just 
wasn’t really clicking, and that 
starts with me.”

The Wolverines have been a 

well-disciplined team all year 
long, averaging 4.7 penalties a 
game but saving most of them for 
inconsequential moments.

Saturday, they still only had five 

penalties, but all had a tangible 
effect on the game. In the first 
quarter, freshman linebacker and 
special teams standout Devin 
Bush get ejected for targeting 
the punter (despite the fact that 
said punter had already stumbled 
and somersaulted without even 
being touched). Later in the first, 
Michigan ran into the same punter 
on two consecutive fourth-down 
plays to give Iowa a first down. In 
the second, redshirt sophomore 
defensive tackle Bryan Mone’s 
unnecessary roughness penalty set 
up the Hawkeyes’ lone touchdown 
of the game. And finally — worst 
of all — redshirt junior linebacker 
Mike McCray committed a face-
mask penalty at midfield to put 
Iowa on the brink of field goal 

range on the game’s final drive.

All season, the Wolverines have 

managed to keep their offense on 
the field by picking up key third 
downs and giving the defense time 
to rest.

Against the Hawkeyes, they 

scored only one touchdown, had 
five three-and-outs, took a safety 
and lost the time-of-possession 
battle by five minutes. Still, 
Michigan’s defense largely held 
its own — the Wolverines held 
Iowa to 4-for-16 on third down, 
and senior cornerback Channing 
Stribling nearly saved the game 
with an interception.

And then Michigan’s offense 

thanked him by promptly going 
three-and-out again.

The Wolverines can’t even 

blame the kicking game anymore 
— fifth-year senior Kenny Allen 
proved he’s well past his early-
season struggles by making both of 
his field goals, including a career-
long 51-yarder that would have 
stood as the game-winner until 
Iowa answered it at the end.

In the end, most of 

Michigan’s strengths were 
neutralized, and the hostile 
environment just got wilder.

“Guys weren’t really hearing 

play calls and stuff, because (the 
fans) were going nuts,” Speight 
said. “Any time you come to Iowa 
— I mean, Coach told us before the 
game and after the game about 
when he came into Iowa and they 
lost on a last-second field goal. It 
happens. It’s football.”

Harbaugh’s second crazy 

night at Kinnick truly was the 
perfect storm of ineptitude 
from Michigan — the kind of 
ineptitude that the Wolverines 
can’t afford to show against 
Indiana next week, nor in 
Columbus in two weeks, and 
certainly not in the postseason.

Michigan had already seen 

what can happen when everything 
is firing on all cylinders, and now 
it’s seen what can happen when 
nothing is. The Wolverines are 
lucky to have most of their goals 
still alive, but this loss makes some 
of those goals seem like a long shot.

The dream of perfection died 

Saturday — it was swallowed up 
by the black-and-gold mass that 
flooded every inch of Kinnick 
Stadium.

Now, Michigan has to make sure 

its season doesn’t die there, too.

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
Sports are not an escape from politics
I 

appreciate the need for 
distraction, but this won’t 
be a sports column today.

Something 

unthinkable 
happened 
last week, so 
I’m going to 
think about 
it. I’m going 
to ask you to 
do the same.

If you’re 

reading 
this, you’re 
probably 
a sports fan, and that’s great, 
because it means we have 
something in common. Over the 
next weeks and months, you’re 
going to hear how that means 
we should come together, forget 
politics and unite over sports. 
It’s tempting to do that — to 
ignore the most raw, visceral 
emotions we’ve felt through this 
election cycle — and instead 
high-five over touchdowns.

I am begging you to reject 

that opportunity.

If you are a mourner, and 

you mourn through sports, by 
all means, mourn. If you are a 
worrier, and sports calm you, 
by all means, watch. No one 
is saying you shouldn’t still 
enjoy them. But to treat sports 
as an escape from politics is a 
dangerous proposition.

The truth is that sports can’t 

be separated from politics. 
Politics are everywhere in 
sports, from the power dynamics 
between athletes and owners 
and leagues, to the statements 
we make in the different ways 
we praise athletes of different 
races and genders. If we have 
willfully ignored that, it’s on us 
to correct it right now.

Sports fans have sports 

friends, which gives us the 
perfect chance to start the 
dialogues that lead to change. 
A lot of what I know about 
social justice came from a 

mentor I had at a sports writing 
internship. After work (and 
sometimes during), we would 
talk about the politics of sports. 
Our friendship changed the 
ways I thought about the names 
“Redskins” and “Indians,” 
the ways I watched and 
praised female athletes and 
my fundamental approach to 
covering sports.

They were formative 

conversations, ones that changed 
how I see the world — even 
outside of sports. Currently, that 
friend is out of sports writing. 
He was never afraid to speak out 
against injustice, and when he 
did, the common response from 
fans was to tell him to stick to 
sports. He didn’t, and I want to 
follow that lead.

I’m still going to cover sports, 

and I’m still going to give it my 
all. But I’m also not going to 
be shy about writing about the 
politics inherent to the games 
we love.

When athletes kneel during 

the national anthem, they are 
trying to tell us something. 
When they speak out about 
not having rights to their own 
brands despite driving multi-
million dollar industries, they 
are trying to tell us something. 
So who the hell are we to tell 
them we don’t want to hear it?

The athletes we cheer 

for don’t get to escape those 
realities. It’s entirely unfair to 
use them so that we can.

I suspect this column will be 

unpopular for the same reason 
so many like it are. Sports 
are comfortable because we 

consume them in our spaces, 
on our terms. That’s why, 
when athletes speak out, those 
opposed to their beliefs try to 
quiet them. We don’t tend to 
like the political battleground 
invading our place of refuge.

I don’t mean to be an 

alarmist, but I’ve had alarms 
ringing non-stop in my head 
for the last week. I’m a straight 
white man, so I’m writing 
this from a place of immense 
privilege, but I am petrified at 
what is to come. I adore writing 
about sports, but every time 
I’ve tried since Tuesday, it feels 
hollow. It is hollow.

Lives changed last week, 

and yet there I was on Saturday 
night, frantically writing about 
how the Michigan football team 
could move on from a loss on a 

last-second field goal. That is not 
the kind of moving on I wanted 
to be thinking about.

The fact of the matter is that 

politics aren’t going away. Now, 
more than ever, we as a society 
have to be attentive to politics 
at all times, even in seemingly 
non-political arenas. They are 
a taboo topic that we’re taught 
to avoid, but it’s time to break 
that trend. Ignorance has 
consequences. We can either 
have the unpleasant talks now, 
or we can realize what we 
missed later.

It’s tempting to stick to sports. 

But it’s imperative that we don’t.

Football can be a calming influence, but the game encompasses the same political themes found in other walks of life.

‘M’ still 
seeking 

consistency

The Michigan hockey team’s 

season has been about as easy 
to predict as a slot machine. The 
Wolverines 
have blown out 
the No. 4 team 
in the country, 
lost decisively 
to an unranked 
team and won 
in a shootout 
against an 
in-state rival.

While 

No. 18 
Michigan (5-4-1) has gotten stellar 
performances from freshmen 
goaltenders Hayden Lavigne and 
Jack LaFontaine — even though 
they’ve faced nearly 40 shots in 
multiple games — it has also seen 
goaltenders give up easy goals 
in close games. The Wolverines 
have had games where their 
senior leaders haven’t produced 
anything, and games in which 
senior forward Alex Kile has 
scored from his knees. Freshman 
forward Will Lockwood has 
impressed throughout the season, 
but his fellow freshmen have 
experienced growing pains.

Through 10 games, nothing 

has been certain, and trends 
have been few.

Perhaps the best representation 

of that unpredictability occurred 
this weekend against Boston. 
In Friday night’s game, the 
already-young Michigan team 
was without four of its seniors. 
Kile, forward Max Shuart, 
defenseman Nolan De Jong and 
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort were 
all suspended, yet the Wolverines 
played perhaps their best game so 
far, dominating 4-0.

The next day, when those seniors 

came back, the team couldn’t 
maintain its momentum, losing 4-2. 
So though Michigan has shown 
it can hang with some of the top 
teams, it just hasn’t shown there’s 
any rhyme or reason to when they 
do and when they don’t.

“I think we’ve got to grow 

from this,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson of the team’s 
performance against Boston. 
“There’s more positive than there 
is negative, but we’ve got to build 
on that positive part of our game 
and our team.”

Part of that growth could 

come from some clarity in terms 
of a starting goaltender. Lavigne 
has accrued two shutouts in 
his first four starts, and his .956 
save percentage is the best in the 
country. And after LaFontaine had 
a bit of a rocky outing in Saturday’s 
weekend finale against Boston, 
Lavigne may be seeing more time 
in net.

“That’s a tough game,” 

LaFontaine said. “For the team — I 
think we worked so hard, and then 
I let up a couple weak ones in the 
third (period). I just need to be 
better than that.”

But even if Lavigne can maintain 

his form, he will need some 
help from his teammates. The 
Wolverines have been outshot in 
every game this season except one. 
And while early in the season that 
could be chalked up to the team 
being in a rebuilding phase, that 
won’t always be the case, especially 
if Lockwood and freshman forward 
Jake Slaker continue to be some of 
the primary contributors.

The rebuilding narrative isn’t 

something Michigan is buying into 
anyways.

“I’m a junior, I only have two 

years left,” said forward Dexter 
Dancs. “I don’t want it to be a 
rebuilding year. This weekend 
there was definitely some extra 
motivation to tell everyone that 
this isn’t one of those years where 
we’re just going to maybe split a 
weekend and we’ll be happy. We 
weren’t happy with this weekend. 
(Boston) is a good team, but we felt 
that we definitely could have won 
both games.”

Those are certainly big words, 

and it is a sentiment that has been 
repeated by multiple players. But 
so far, the Wolverines have yet to 
string together consistent outings 
to prove the ability they believe 
they have.

And if they are unable to 

build off the success they had 
this weekend, the future may be 
marred with the same uncertainty 
Michigan has experienced these 
first 10 games.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan rolls Niagara

In the early minutes of the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
game 
against 
Niagara, 
the 
Wolverines 
committed 
five 

turnovers.

But 
Michigan’s 
early 

sloppiness became a distant 
memory by the end of the 
contest, as the Wolverines 
dominated Niagara to the 
tune of a 107-35 victory. Six 
Michigan players scored at 
least 10 points during Sunday’s 
game, and the team coughed up 
the ball just twice throughout 
the remainder of the game.

“I thought we did a great 

job of sharing the basketball, 
making plays, giving everyone 
an opportunity to contribute,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes 
Arico. 
“The 
most 

impressive thing for me was 
that we started the game with 
five turnovers early and then 
we only had two for the rest of 
the game. And that was an area 
where we weren’t really happy 
the other night. So I think we 
improved in that area.”

Just 
like 
during 
its 

win 
against 
Oakland 
on 

Friday, Michigan turned to 
sophomore 
center 
Hallie 

Thome to score inside. Of the 
Wolverines’ first five scores, 
three were Thome layups.

The early move paid off as 

junior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
made a three-pointer 27 seconds 
after Thome’s third layup. 
Michigan cruised to the end of 
the first quarter with a 29-12 
edge while Flaherty finished 
the game with 14 points.

“We 
want 
Hallie 
and 

Katelynn to get as many touches 
in the game as possible,” Barnes 
Arico said. “That’s our first look 
every game to see if we can get 
Hallie and Katelynn involved 
early. I think other teams try to 
take those two away specifically, 
that’s the goal of other teams, 
that ‘If we can shut down Hallie 
Thome and Katelynn Flaherty 

we can be successful against 
Michigan.’ 

“That’s why I think it’s so 

great that other people are 
stepping up. But if we have 
the opportunity to get Hallie 
or Katelynn the ball, we think 
they’re gonna be successful.”

The Wolverines dominated 

even more in the second quarter 
as they outscored the Purple 
Eagles, 27-6, to take a 56-18 lead 
at halftime. Freshman guard 
Kysre Gondrezick continued 
to demonstrate why she was 
so highly touted, tallying eight 
points in the second quarter 
alone out of 12 on the day.

Michigan showed even less 

mercy in the third and fourth 
quarters as Michigan pieced 
together a 29-0 run that lasted 
for about 10 minutes. Junior 
guard Maria Backman scored 
seven of her career-high 13 
points during that span.

“I feel great,” Backman said. 

“We got the win, and that’s the 
first and foremost thing that’s 
most important. I think having 
teammates that like to share the 
ball so much, it’s an ode to them.”

The early blowout allowed 

Michigan 
to 
showcase 

freshmen for extended periods 
of time. Every player on the 
roster saw the court for at least 
11 minutes, and freshman guard 
Kayla Robbins played for 21.

Robbins made the most of 

her time on the floor, attaining 
the Wolverines’ first double-
double of the season. She tallied 
13 points and 11 rebounds 
against Niagara.

While it is unlikely that the 

Wolverines will be tested in 
home contests versus Howard or 
Western Michigan, who finished 
327th and 150th, respectively, 
in last year’s Rating Percentage 
Index, 
more 
challenging 

contests are not far away.

Michigan will travel to the 

Virgin Islands for the Paradise 
Jam tournament and will play 
three games. One of them is 
against Florida State, who is 
currently ranked 12th in the 
Associated Press poll. A lot 
will be learned about the true 
character of this team then.

Wilson sets tone for season

DeVante Jaylen Wilson, better 

know as DJ, was introduced by 
his namesake back in September.

Jalen Rose, who was the 

inspiration 
behind 
Wilson’s 

middle name, was going through 
the Michigan roster one by one. 
But when Rose arrived on the 
redshirt sophomore’s cue card 
for the introduction, he seemed 
surprised to find a fringe player 
proudly owning his number five.

Despite their shared jersey 

number, Rose and Wilson couldn’t 
be more different players. Rose 
was a guard. Wilson is a forward. 
Rose was an instant star. Wilson 
redshirted his freshman year. 
The differences go on to even the 
shorts they prefer. Rose famously 
loathed the short-shorts that 
were the trend in the early 90s. 
But Wilson is one of the few still 
sporting short-shorts today.

But 
after 
the 
Wolverines’ 

opening two games — both wins 
over Howard and IUPUI — it 
looks like the script is slowly 
starting to change.

Wilson came off the bench in 

both outings and put together the 
two most complete performances 
of his career thus far. The redshirt 
sophomore recorded a career 
high eight rebounds accompanied 
by nine points against the Bison, 
and followed that up with a career 
high 14 rebounds Sunday.

“Defensively, last year, we 

couldn’t get him on the floor,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“Now he’s spent a year getting 
better. If he says to himself, ‘I am 
a rebounder and defender,’ he’ll 
get baskets. These guys will find 
him when he’s open.”

The 
past 
two 
years, 
the 

Wolverines have lacked a dynamic 
forward who can aggressively 
crash the board and effectively 
guard the perimeter. Michigan 
has had to rely on players like 
redshirt junior guard Duncan 
Robinson and senior guard Zak 
Irvin to not only face-guard 
opponents, but also drop back and 
get in the mix for rebounds.

But Robinson and Irvin don’t 

have the height or build to 

matchup with more tradional 
forwards in the position. That’s 
why Wilson’s versatility has 
become noticeable on the court 
and on the stat sheet.

“Defense was much better,” 

Beilein said. “DJ Wilson is really 
changing the way we guard. We 
can switch more because he can 
guard five positions.”

Beilein knew all along Wilson 

had the ability and talent to find 
a major role on this Michigan 
roster. He just needed a boost in 
confidence he hadn’t received 
going into previous seasons.

Playing behind the likes of 

Irvin, Robinson and transfers Kam 
Chatman and Aubrey Dawkins has 
been daunting at times for Wilson. 
He could never figure out his place 
in that rotation.

But the departures of Chatman 

and Dawkins — paired with 
the arrival of the defensive and 
frontcourt minds of assistants Billy 
Donlon and Saddi Washington — 
have turned around the redshirt 
sophomore’s mindset.

“I think he was kind of passive 

on the fact that he himself is a 
great player,” said senior guard 
Derrick Walton. “He was playing 

behind some great players as 
well. I think he’s accepted the 
fact that he’s one of the key 
contributors on this team. His 
role is non-negotiable. We need 
him. I think that’s the biggest 
difference in his mindset.”

Wilson’s 
seven 
points, 
14 

rebounds and five blocks against 
the Jaguars are just a preview of 
what the Wolverines are going to 
need out of him. Points will come 
for Wilson, but his defensive 
abilities are what Michigan is 
going to need to lean on the 
forward for.

He may not light up arenas like 

the most famous number five in 
Michigan basketball history used 
to do, but Wilson will still make 
his teammates and fans happy 
with the effort he’ll display on the 
court from here on out.

“I smile every time he walks 

into the game, because I know 
for a fact he’s going to take care of 
those things for us,” Walton said. 
“He’s been great. He had a great 
summer. He was great even last 
year when he didn’t get a chance 
to play. I’m just excited he’s 
getting his opportunity to shine. 
He’s going to be a great player.”

DJ Wilson finished Sunday’s game with seven points, 14 rebounds and five blocks.

Wolverines fall to BU, split weekend

After a 4-0 shutout of fourth-

ranked 
Boston 
University 

(4-3-1) on Friday, the No. 18 
Michigan hockey team (5-3-1) 
returned to Yost Ice Arena on 
Saturday to finish its weekend 
series. In a much closer game 
than Friday’s, with the score 
knotted up 1-1 for the majority of 
the second period, the matchup 
boiled down to the third period 
to determine a winner.

In a flurry of late-game goals, 

Boston University managed to 
edge out the Wolverines after 
scoring three times in the last 
ten minutes, earning a weekend 
split with a 4-2 win.

“I think we got a little away 

from our game,” said junior 
forward Dexter Dancs. “In 
the first two periods, the first 
period 
especially, 
we 
were 

physical, we didn’t give them 
much. Then in the third period 
there were a couple defensive 
lapses, and they have a lot of 
skill, and they were able to 
capitalize.”

Like 
Friday’s 
game, 
the 

Wolverines 
capitalized 
on 

scoring opportunities quickly. 
Just two minutes and 11 seconds 
into the first period, senior 
defenseman Nolan De Jong was 
able to pass the puck between 
two 
Terriers 
to 
freshman 

forward 
James 
Sanchez. 

Sanchez fed it to the slot to 
sophomore Brendan Warren, 
who sniped it into the net for 
the first goal of the game.

Unlike 
Friday’s 
game, 

though, the Terriers retaliated. 
At the 14:32 mark in the second 
period, 
Boston 
University’s 

Dante Fabbro, off an assist 
from forward Patrick Harper, 
managed a shot directly over 
freshman 
goaltender 
Jack 

LaFontaine’s left shoulder to 
knot up the game, 1-1.

After Fabbro’s goal, both 

teams battled it out to break 
the tie in the second period. 

In a particularly close call — 
which had every Wolverine 
fan in Yost standing on their 
feet before they realized the 
puck hadn’t gone in — senior 
forward Alex Kile took a shot 
that drifted behind Boston 
goaltender Jake Oettinger. But 
with no Michigan player close 
enough to finish it off, the game 
remained settled at a tie.

The Terriers almost broke 

the stalemate at the end of 
the second period as well, 
as forward Bobo Carpenter 
managed to find the net behind 
LaFontaine. 
However, 
after 

review, the goal was waved off 
for high sticking, and the period 
ended still tied up, 1-1.

Ultimately, the Terriers were 

the ones to break the tie.

At the 10:56 mark, Boston 

University 
forward 
Jordan 

Greenway 
passed 
the 
puck 

straight to defenseman Charlie 
McAvoy, who found the net 
to put the Terriers up, 2-1. 
Junior forward Dexter Dancs, 
though, cancelled out the goal 
barely a minute after McAvoy’s, 
managing to slip the puck past 
Oettinger to tie up the game 
again, 2-2.

But two more goals from 

Boston 
University 
would 

ultimately 
seal 
Michigan’s 

fate in the last eight minutes 
of the game. The first was by 
Greenway at the 7:29 mark, a 
shot that went directly over 
LaFontaine’s right shoulder. 
The other was a tip by Harper 
at the 4:57 mark to seal the 

game, 4-2.

Despite 
the 
outcome 
of 

Saturday’s game, though, the 
Wolverines are viewing the 
weekend as a good opportunity 
to prepare for Big Ten play later 
in the season.

“It’s not all negative,” said 

Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“In fact, there’s more positive 
than it is negative. But we’ve 
got to build on that positive 
part of our game and our team. 
We went through what we went 
through last week and we’ve got 
to have a good week this week 
and we’ve only got one game 
next week and then two against 
a tough Lake (Superior) State 
team, and then we’re in the Big 
Ten. So we’ve got three games 
to get ready for the Big Ten.”

Michigan’s season 
ends at Regionals

The Michigan men’s cross 

country team has been in the 
middle of the pack all season, 
just short of winning in multiple 
meets. Friday, that was the case 
again.

The Wolverines traveled to 

Madison to compete in the NCAA 
Great Lakes Regional. Michigan 
placed fifth behind Wisconsin, 
Michigan State, Indiana and 
Eastern Michigan with 107 total 
points. The results of the race 
bring the Wolverines’ run in 
the tournament, as well as their 
season, to an end.

Junior Aaron Baumgarten led 

the race through the six kilometer 
mark, but in the final stretch, 
Wisconsin’s Malachy Schrobilgen 
and Morgan McDonald would 
prevail as the two top finishers. 
Baumgarten placed 10th overall, 
finishing as the top runner for the 
Wolverines with a time of 30:33.4.

Narrowly behind Baumgarten 

was junior Billy Bund, who 
finished 11th with a time of 
30:34.0. Fifth-year senior Connor 
Herr came in 18th (30:50.5), 
freshman Jordy Hewitt came in 
23rd (31:04.7) and senior Connor 
Mora came in 45th (31:39.9). 
Juniors Austin Benoit and Micah 

Beller finished in 104th (32:38.8) 
and 127th (33:11.2), respectively.

“Baumgarten and some of the 

Wisconsin guys were pretty much 
controlling the tempo of the race, 
and some of us Michigan guys 
were keying off each other right 
behind Baumgarten,” Bund said. 
“Over the last 2,000 meters the 
race separated a bit and all of us 
just tried to do our best to beat as 
many jerseys as possible.”

Added Michigan coach Kevin 

Sullivan: “You can let it get you 
down and you can mope and 
whine and stay pretty negative, 
or you can use it as motivation 
to do better the next time out. 
Talent doesn’t change. You’ve got 
to respond to performances that 
don’t live up to your standards just 
as you would to your exceptional 
performances.” 

Even though the cross country 

season has come to an end, 
Sullivan still believes in the talent 
of his team.

“(Freshman) Jordy Hewitt was 

really exceptional,” Sullivan said. 
“He made up 10-15 places in the 
second half of the race, and that’s 
what we needed in a situation like 
we were in today.”

“I think, at the end of the day, 

we’re a team. We’re trying to 
support each other, and we will 
continue to get better from here.”

The Michigan men’s cross-country team finished fifth at NCAA Regionals.

Wolverines fall in PKs, ending season

Nine 
penalties 
had 
been 

taken, and nine penalties were 
scored. The game ended 2-2 in 
regular time, and one kick would 
decide what would happen next. 
Illinois State was up 5-4 in the 
penalty shootout, and Michigan 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Abby 

Kastroll stepped up to try and level 
it for the Wolverines.

Her shot — headed for the top-

right corner of the goal — had 
the keeper beat. The ball crashed 
against the woodwork, though, 
knocking Michigan out of the 
NCAA tournament.

“Penalties are just penalties.” 

said Michigan coach Greg Ryan. 
“We’ve seen David Beckham 
miss them badly, send them 20 
yards over the goal. I’m glad we 
drew and went out on penalties. 
We didn’t lose, but we just can’t 
go to the next round either.”

The Wolverines (6-3-2 Big 

Ten, 10-5-5 overall) started 
the game well against Illinois 
State’s (5-0-1 Missouri Valley, 
14-5-3 overall) high-pressing 
tactics, and managed to win 
the ball back quickly in the 
midfield after losing it. This 
resulted in two opportunities 
for Michigan inside the first 20 
minutes of the game, though 
both were off target.

“You get a certain number of 

chances in a game,” Ryan said. 
“And if you put those away, then 
you have a good game, and if you 
don’t, you leave an opening for 
the other team.”

With 
its 
first 
real 
bout 

of 
possession 
in 
the 
final 

third, Illinois State made the 
Wolverines 
pay. 
Midfielder 

Emily Dickman moved past 
three Michigan defenders before 
playing in midfielder Abby Basler 
inside the box. Basler passed 
to forward Lauren Koehl, who 
let the ball roll past her body 
before taking a touch to beat her 
defender and curl the ball into 
the roof of the net.

Michigan switched up its 

tactics in the second half, moving 
Martin further up the field 
as a second striker alongside 

Waldeck. Martin’s new position 
on the field increased her influence 
across the pitch, as she provided 
two assists, and brought the 
Wolverines back into the game.

The change had an almost 

immediate effect five minutes into 
the half. Martin won a free kick in 
the Redbird half and from the set 
piece floated the ball into the box, 
where freshman defender Jada 
Dayne headed it in to even the 
score, 1-1.

Michigan asserted control of 

the second half the same way it 
had in the first, but once again let 
its guard down and paid the price.

Halfway through the second 

half, Illinois State midfielder Kelli 
Zickert found herself with space 

in midfield. She managed to play 
a perfect pass for Dickman, who 
was unmarked inside the box. 
Dickman made no mistake, as she 
buried the ball into the side netting 
at the far post.

“We gave them just two good 

chances,” Ryan said.

Traling 
once 
again, 
the 

Wolverines needed another goal 
to stay in the NCAA Tournament.

With 15 minutes left in the half, 

Michigan crossed the ball into 
the box, where Martin flicked 
it on to Waldeck. Waldeck took 
her chance this time around and 
headed it over the Illinois State 
keeper, tying the game once again.

“It’s always tough coming in 

from behind,” Martin said. “And 

we knew that set pieces were going 
to be a big part of this game, so it 
was good that it gave us a chance 
to stay in the tournament.”

Michigan 
had 
two 
great 

chances in extra time. Both were 
off corners, and each time the ball 
found the back of the net. Twice 
the Wolverines thought they had 
put the game to bed with a golden 
goal, and twice the referee waived 
it off for what appeared to be a foul 
in the box.

One hundred and 10 minutes 

weren’t enough time to separate 
the two sides, so penalties decided 
which team would advance to the 
next round. After scoring all their 
spot kicks, it was the Redbirds that 
gained the right to do so.

Finn wins Great Lakes 
Regional, on to NCAAs

Friday, 
one 
week 
after 

bringing home the Big Ten 
championship, 
the 
Michigan 

women’s cross country team ran 
its way to its 11th win in the Great 
Lakes Regional, all of which 
have been under the instruction 
of coach Mike McGuire.

The 
win 
marks 
the 

Wolverines’ 
second 
straight 

regional title, adding to an 
already impressive year.

“It feels good,” McGuire said. 

“(The win) validated our Big Ten 
performance with a solid race 
again today.”

The 

Wolverines 
finished first out 
of 32 teams in 
the tournament 
with 61 points, 
30 points ahead 
of second-place 
Notre 
Dame. 

Host Wisconsin 
and 
Michigan 

State each tied 
for third place 
with 97 points each.

Beyond 
winning 
the 

tournament as a team, senior 
Erin Finn won the individual 
competition, becoming the first 
Michigan runner to do so since 
2011. Finn clocked in at 19:27.5 
in the 6,000-meter race, just 
beating Notre Dame’s Anna 
Rohrer, who finished with a time 
of 19:35.7. 

Finn has had an illustrious 

college career as a three-time 
individual Big Ten champion, 
two-time All-American, and a 
three-time Big Ten Athlete of 
the Year. But this season may 
end up being her best.

“I’m just more prepared than 

I’ve ever been,” Finn said, “I’m 
fitter than I’ve ever been, I’m 
smarter than I’ve ever been.”

McGuire also praised Finn, 

saying that she has “done a great 
job” this season.

Two 
other 
Wolverines, 

juniors Gina Sereno and Avery 
Evenson, also finished in the 
top 10, with times of 20:15.5 and 
20:19.1, respectively. In addition 
to Finn’s performance, Sereno 
and Evenson were essential in 
winning the race for Michigan. 
Juniors Jamie Morrissey and 
Jaimie 
Phelan, 
along 
with 

sophomore 
Claire 
Borchers 

and 
freshman 
Madeline 

Trevisan, also contributed to the 
Wolverines’ win.

With the cross country team 

riding high on momentum and 

working well as a 
collective team, 
it is now focused 
on 
preparing 

for 
next 

week’s 
NCAA 

Championship.

“It’s 
the 

pinnacle 
of 
racing,” 

McGuire 
said. 

“We’re 
just 

looking 
to 

embrace it.”

The Wolverines have little 

time to rest before Saturday’s 
championships, but the team 
does not plan to change anything 
from its winning formula.

“It’s been working so far, so 

we’re not going to change it too 
much,” Finn said. “(We want to) 
get excited, but not too excited 
too early.”

Despite wanting to keep calm 

ahead of the tournament, Finn 
could not help but express some 
excitement over next week’s 
championships.

“It’s really exciting,” Finn 

said. “We wanted to keep the 
momentum 
rolling. 
We’re 

excited heading into nationals, 
and we’re confident we can do 
big things there.”

“It’s the pinnacle 

of racing. We’re 

just looking to 

embrace it.”

FOOTBALL
‘We couldn’t believe it’: Iowa fans relish chaos of upset win

IOWA CITY — Inside the Iowa 

student section, at the end of a 
night both sides will remember 
for a long time, Liam Crawford 
had one thought. And of course 
everyone else had the same one.

At 5-4, the Hawkeyes had 

trudged through a forgettable 
season. They lost to North Dakota 
State and Northwestern earlier 
this season, and few gave them 
much of a chance against the No. 3 
Michigan football team. It did not 
seem to matter. At the end of a long 
Saturday night, with three seconds 
left and the Wolverines ahead 
13-11, Iowa kicker Keith Duncan 
jogged onto the field for a 33-yard 
field-goal attempt to win the game.

Behind the end zone into which 

Duncan would try that kick, the 
Iowa students inched forward in 
the bleachers. “Rush the field!” 
Crawford thought, and the stadium 
went silent.

“Please, please, please!” one 

fan shouted into the night. Tyler 
Kluver delivered the snap. Ron 
Coluzzi placed down the hold. 
Duncan knocked the kick through 
the uprights.

“We couldn’t believe it,” said 

27-year-old Corbett Ball, who was 
seated near the 50-yard line. “We 
were on the field immediately.”

The students crammed into the 

last few rows before storming onto 
the turf, and everything else was 
pandemonium. Tyler Brenneman, 
another student, called it the “best 
day ever.” A few fans took pictures 
while sprawled out in the end zone. 
Others just ran around in awe. 

“Oh my God, we pulled it off!” one 
yelled, adding an expletive.

They 
engulfed 
the 
players 

in a mass of bodies on the field. 
They stood on top of each other’s 
shoulders and took videos. They 
left the goalpost lopsided where 
Duncan had kicked it.

Through 
the 
chaos, 
the 

Wolverines shuffled off the field, 
their dreams of a perfect season 
spoiled. 
November 
features 

a handful of similar finishes 
every year, with shocking upsets 
sparking field rushes and knocking 
off top teams. Michigan rose to No. 
3 in the polls this season for the 
first time since 2006. Once again, 
the Wolverines were susceptible 
to such heartbreak, and with that 
came euphoria on the other end.

“We 
couldn’t 
believe 
what 

was happening and what was 

unfolding,” Ball said. “We felt, for 
the first time this season, it made 
our season.”

With 114 seconds left in such 

a momentous game, the biggest 
possible victory seemed implausible. 
Hawkeyes 
quarterback

Beathard had just missed an open 
Jerminic Smith on a pass downfield, 
instead throwing an interception to 
Michigan cornerback Channing 
Stribling. The Wolverines needed 
only one first down to ice the victory 
and escape with a win.

An announced sellout crowd of 

70,585, all standing, groaned with 
disappointment. About 1,000 of 
them left the stadium. “Go home,” 
one said as he walked out. “It’s over.”

Inside the student section, 

though, the fans knew better. 
Kyle Ford, Cameron Clause and 
Michael Taloumis saw the 1:14 

on the clock and thought if Iowa 
could force a three-and-out on 
Michigan’s next series, perhaps 
there could be just a bit more 
magic left in Kinnick Stadium.

From the moment the handfuls 

of fans left the stadium, everything 
went Iowa’s way, and nobody left 
again for a long time. The students 
clung to the last shreds of hope for 
an upset. Other fans watched on 
the TVs in the concourse, afraid 
to miss the finish if they journeyed 
back to their seats.

Each play, the fans raised the 

intensity back up as fortunes shifted 
back in their favor. Iowa stuffed two 
consecutive Michigan run plays. On 
third down, Hawkeyes cornerback 
Manny Rugamba broke up a pass 
to force a punt. On that punt, a 
Michigan face-mask penalty gave 
Iowa 15 more yards.

The Hawkeyes inched into 

field-goal range until they stopped 
and called a timeout at Michigan’s 
15-yard line. The masses of fans left 
in the stadium awaited the kick.

“I was thinking, ‘Oh my God, 

we’re going to do this again,’ ” 
said Crawford, who was also in 
attendance 
when 
Iowa 
upset 

then-No. 3 Penn State on a similar 
game-winning field goal in 2008. 
“History is repeating itself.”

Sure enough, it did, and it 

will again. Each time will bring 
something different, a unique 
heartbreak for the favored team 
and a unique joy for the giant 
killer. Saturday in Iowa City added 
another chapter to a memorable 
history of November finishes.

“We don’t get this opportunity 

very often at Kinnick Stadium,” 
Ball said. “It was unbelievable.”
