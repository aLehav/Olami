* Trying ife in a wheelchair

Fraternity event
focuses on disabilities
through wheeled-5K
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
About 40 members of the Uni-
versity's chapter of Pi Kappa Phi
fraternity gathered Sunday for
the fourth-annual Wheel in their
Shoes 5K. But instead of lacing
up tennis shoes in preparation of
the event, the brothers lowered

themselves into wheelchairs for
the trek across campus.
The two-hour event, which
began at the University of Michi-
gan Health System's Cardio-
vascular Center and continued
across Central Campus, was held
to raise awareness for people
with disabilities among the Uni-
versity community.
The 2012 event raised about
$1,500 for Push America, a
national non-profit that serves
people with disabilities. LSA
junior Nicholas Guys, Pi Kappa
Phi's philanthropy chair, said

they expect to raise roughly the
same amount of funds in 2013.
Guys said the 5K is the fra-
ternity's largest event of the fall,
and, in addition to raising aware-
ness, the event also allows the
brothers to gain a better under-
standing of the difficulties of
using a wheelchair for mobility.
"The point of the event is for us
to learnfirsthand about ways that
we can make campus a little bit
more accessible for people with
disabilities," Guys said. "Because
as ... we all know from doing this,
it's really, really tough."

In addition to those in wheel-
chairs, other members of the
fraternity helped to push their
brothers up hills and keep them
on course. As the caravan made its
way down from the Cardiovascu-
lar Center, a few membersslid into
the street or off into the bushes.
A minor traffic jam was caused
when the brothers crossed State
Street on their way to the Cube.
One wheelchair lost its tire.
LSA senior Paul Willar, a
member of Pi Kappa Phi, said
the event can be an "eye-opening

GOP governor
hasn't yet said
whether he'll
run in 2014
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
With this November's ballot
absent, Detroit's mayoral contest
is likely to grip political focus
throughout the fall. But more
than a year from midterm elec-
tion season, state political orga-
nizers are beginning to mobilize
forces around two crucial deci-
sions in 2014: the election of a
U.S. senator and governor.
Though Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder said he wouldn't
announce whether or not he
would seek a second term until
early 2014, Michigan Democrats
have been rallying prospec-
tive Democratic nominee Mark
Schauer for much of the summer.
Schauer, a former state and

U.S. representative from Battle
Creek, announced his candidacy
last spring and will likely glide
through primary season without
another Democratic challenger.
Schauer has spent most of
the summer attempting to build
statewide familiarity, a challenge
faced by most non-incumbent
candidates. It's especially cru-
cial for Schauer to gain recogni-
tion because he hasn't previously
competed in a statewide race.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily Thursday,
Schauer said a unified Demo-
cratic Party has provided him the
chance to construct a solid cam-
paign organization much earlier
in the election. He also noted that
there has only been an unop-
posed Democratic primary once
since 1970.
"I can focus on 2014, and that's
a fantastic position to be in,"
Schauer said.
Schauer has already racked
up significant millage crisscross-
ing the state over the past few

HANGING OUT

GLOBAL OUTRE ACH
SI students to
tackle India's
toughest issues

AMINIST RATION
Students injured
after falling from
University bus

Trip participants
to work with local
technology leaders
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
In the summer of 2014, aselect
group of students in the School
of Information will be given the
opportunity to tackle some of the
toughest problems facing Indian
society, including agricultural
marketing, health care and job
skills.
Up to 18 students will receive
funding to participate in the
program through the Global
Information Engagement Office.
Information Dean Jeffrey MacK-
ie-Mason said the students will
be able to use skills learned to
leverage India's technological
capabilities to help alleviate some
long-standing general issues.
"One thing that is interesting
about India is a vast population
living in poverty ... but, at the
same time, it's a country that is
very technologically advanced
and has strong systems of high-

er education for those that can
afford it," MacKie-Mason said.
Though the school's faculty
works on projects around the
world - like a venture in South
Africa to create a Nelson Man-
dela archive - this is the school's
first formal education program
abroad.
MacKie-Mason said the pro-
gram will expand to other coun-
tries in coming years after its
initial run in India. Other top
information schools, such as the
University of Maryland and the
University of Washington, have
also established programs in the
country.
Information prof. Joyojeet Pal,
the faculty lead for the program,
said the investigation of informa-
tion problems in India will begin
this academic year before stu-
dents travel to India next sum-
mer.
Indian technology organi-
zations submitted their most
pressing issues to the School of
Information for evaluation, but
Pal said the college is not consid-
ering those issues that only have
relevance in India.

At about 10:30 a.m. Satur-
day, three students fell out of

the rear-side doorofaBlue Bus

accordingto UniversityPolice.
The bus was heading west-

Entrepreneur class shakes up lecture format

'Talk-show' format
gives students
more variety
By YARDAIN AMRON
For The Daily
As students shuffled into
Stamps Auditorium for their
"Entrepreneurship Hour"
seminar, the stage was set with

a rug, coffee table covered in
colorful books, and two homey
armchairs. The set up was quite
different from most lectures, as
was the class that followed.
Engineering prof. David
Thompson introduced this
week's guest entrepreneur, Jose-
phine Polich, founder and CEO of
Cearna, a homeopathic medicine
company developingsurgery and
trauma recovery products.
Thompson played interview-

er, asking Polich questions about
her personal story and compa-
ny's founding. The hour ended
with questions from the student
audience.
The class wasn't a lecture, but
it wasn't always that way.
"Entrepreneurship Hour"
began in 2008 as a one-credit
pass/fail seminar required for
a Program in Entrepreneur-
ship certificate - a nine-credit
"mini-minor" offered through

the Center for Entrepreneurship
within the College of Engineer-
ing, though the program is open
to students across the Univer-
sity. Thompson said a significant
percentage of the 440 students
in the course are from LSA and
other schools.
Each week, the course pro-
vides a forum for entrepreneurs
to come and share their stories
with the students. Thompson

Ladies get to swim, finally

60 YEARSAGO THIS WEEK
(SEPT. 16,1953):
In an effort to expand the lim-
ited opportunities for women
in sports, the University began
construction of a new women's
swimming pool complex. The
project was slated for a total cost
of $1 million.
The pool - along with the
Barbour Gymnasium and Palmer
Field - was one of several facili-
ties offering athletic classes for
women. The Women's Athletic
Association hosted classes in
rifle, golf, field hockey, tennis and
other activities.
30 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK
(SEPT. 15,1983):
Ann Arbor members of the

People for the Reassessment of
Aid to Israel signed a petition
asking President Ronald Reagan
to discontinue aid to Israel.
The petition, which attempt-
ed to garner 5,000 signatures,
called for a formal statement to
be issued to the U.S. Secretary
of State and congressional rep-
resentatives from Michigan that
would request the United States
to halt all economic aid to Israel
in response to hostilities in the
region.
Stanley Mendenhall, founder
of the PRAI, cited the forceful
acquisition of the Arab territo-
ries in 1967 as the reason for the
protest. Mendenhall personally
financed the organization with a
$5,000 payment.

20 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK
(SEPT. 15,1993):
The University tested a new
voicemail system in the Mosh-
er-Jordan Residence Hall. The
new system was put in place in
response to the popularity of
similar systems that administra-
tors used.
Students received personal
accounts, which required that
callers press a number cor-
responding to the name of the
resident they were attempt-
ing to reach. This allowed
residents to maintain privacy
unlike with traditional answer-
ing machines.

Summers withdraws
from Fed consideration

Biden backs diplomatic
approach to crisis in Syria

Yellen likely to
lead nation's
monetary policy
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Lawrence Summers, who was
considered the leading candidate
to succeed Ben Bernanke as
Federal Reserve chairman, has
withdrawn from consideration,
the White House said Sunday.
Summers' withdrawal
followed growing resistance
from critics, including some
members of the Senate
committee that would need to
back his nomination. His exit
could open the door for his chief
rival, Janet Yellen, the Fed's vice
chair. If chosen by President
Barack Obama and confirmed by

the first woman to lead the Fed.
In the past, Obama has
mentioned only one other
candidate as possiblybeingunder
consideration: Donald Kohn, a
former Fed vice chair. But Kohn,
70, has been considered a long
shot.
The administration also
reached out to former Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner
early in the process. Geithner
maintained that he was not
interested in being considered.
Obama is expected to
announce a nominee for the Fed
chairmanship as early as this
month. Bernanke's term ends
Jan. 31, 2014.
Summers and his allies have
been engaged in an unusually
public contest with supporters of
Yellen, with each side lobbyingthe

An openly waged succession
battle is something that the Fed,
which will turn 100 in December,
has never before witnessed. The
selection of a chairman has long
been a matter handled privately by
a president and his senior advisers.
In a statement, Obama said he
had accepted Summers' decision.
"Larry was a critical member
of my team as we faced down
the worst economic crisis since
the Great Depression, and it was
in no small part because of his
expertise, wisdom and leadership
that we wrestled the economy
back to growth and made the kind
of progress we are seeing today,"
Obama said.
As director of the National
Economic Council, Summers
oversaw the administration's
response to the economic and
financial crisis early in Obama's
first term.
Yet Summers faced strenuous
opposition from some Democrats,
including on the Senate Banking
Committee. Summers alluded to
that opposition to his candidacy
in a letter he sent Sunday to
Obama to formally withdraw
from consideration.
"I have reluctantly concluded
that any possible confirmation
process for me would be
acrimonious and would not
serve the interests of the Federal
Reserve, the administration
or ultimately, the interests of
the nation's ongoing economic
recovery," Summers wrote.
Summers' ascent to the top
of the list to succeed Bernanke
rankled both opponents of
the president as well as some
liberal supporters. He has
alienated colleagues in the past
with a brusque and at times
domineering style. Unlike
Bernanke, he's not been known
as a consensus-builder - one
reason some critics had opposed
his nomination.
He was also seen as having
been too cozy with Wall Street
and was criticized for critical
comments he made about women
and math and science.

VP considers
presidential run,
anti-war sentiment
at Iowa rally
INDIANOLA, Iowa (AP)
- Vice President Joe Biden,
speaking to a decidedly anti-
war audience in Iowa on
Sunday, played down the Obama
administration's pledge to use
military force to rid Syria of
chemical weapons.
Biden, weighing a run for
president in 2016, instead touted
the U.S.-Russian diplomatic
proposal for Syria to relinquish
its chemical arsenal under
international supervision.
"We're going to the United
Nations with a resolution this
week that will in fact call on the
United Nations of the world to
put pressure on Syria to have the
confiscation and destruction of
all those weapons," Biden told
hundreds of Iowa's most devout
Democrats at Sen. Tom Harkin's
annual steak picnic and fall
fundraiser.
Biden touched only lightly on
the administration's continued
insistence that "there are
consequences should the
Assad regime not comply."
National public opinion polls
show a military strike on Syria
is unpopular, especially with
Democrats.
The vice president worked to
stoke hope that the diplomatic
solution would work. Making
the administration's first trip
outside Washington since
Obama's speech to the nation
Tuesday, Biden said Obama "is
the reason the world is facing
up finally, finally to this hideous
prospect of this largest stockpile
of chemical weapons."
There was no applause for
his Syria comments from the
audience, supporters of Harkin,
aveteranDemocratpopularwith
his party's anti-war activists.
But listeners rose to their

feet and cheered loudly when
Biden ticked through the
economic gains the country has
made since Obama took office,
improvements the vice president
could benefit from, should they
continue, if he runs for president
in 2016.
Biden praised Harkin as the
"conscience of the Senate," and
the senator also raised hope the
U.S.-Russian proposal would
resolve the Syria issue, which is
dominating world headlines.
"We didn't lose one American
life," Harkin said, in introducing
Biden. "That's leadership folks,
that's leadership."
The hopeful tone in Biden's
and Harkin's remarks came
despite Obama's warning in an
interview Sunday, "if diplomacy
fails, the United States remains
prepared to act."
Obama, who rode an anti-
war wave to victory in Iowa's
2008 presidential caucuses, had
proposed limited air strikes
in Syria in response to what
the U.S. says was a chemical
weapons attack last month that
killed more than 1,400 people.
His administration blames the
government of Syrian President
Bashar Assad.
Some Democrats in
attendance said that even if the
president later orders a military
strike, Obama will not have
rushed to war.
"At the end of the day, if that
terrible option has to be played
out, this crowd, what they voted
for Barack Obama to do, what
they wanted, was this kind of
leadership: smart, thoughtfulnot
reactionary," said former state
party Chairwoman Sue Dvorsky.
His own party cool to a
military strike, Obama has
struggled to win support for
military action from members
of Congress, whose constituents
have endured more than a
decade of war.
An Associated Press poll
taken Sept. 6-8 showed 34
percent of Democrats said
they wanted Congress to back

military action. More than
three-fourths said they thought
any military such action was at
least somewhat likely to turn
into a long-term commitment of
forces, including 44 percent who
said it was extremely likely.
Asked if he could rally leery
Democrats should diplomacy
fail, Biden told reporters briefly
"I think we're going to be OK."
Biden is considering running
for the top job in the White
House in 2016, and the crowd
he mingled with Sunday,
including many familiar with
the two-time presidential
candidate, would have the
opening say during the state's
caucuses.
He linked himself with the
administration's efforts to lift
the slow-recovering economy,
and with Obama in particular.
And while Biden is well known
in Iowa from his presidential
races, Obama's approval
nationally, under 50 percent,
would be a challenge for him.
"We have a clear vision for
America that rests on a growing
and prosperous middle class,
where the playing field is level,"
Biden said, "and where we lead
the world again in the power of
our example."
WithHillaryClintonand Biden
as the most prominent Democrats
being discussed for their party's
2016 nomination, Obama said
in a broadcast interview that he
suspects both politicians would
say it was "way too premature" to
focus on the race.
Asked about Biden's visit,
the president told ABC's "This
Week" that "Iowa's a big state
and (Biden is) an old friend of
Tom Harkin's." The two were
Senate colleagues.
"We consider Joe Biden one
of our own," said Jon Mixdorf,
who serves on the executive
committee for the Black Hawk
County Democrats. "If Joe
Biden can carry that tradition
Obama has started, we would
be behind him. But honestly it
would be close."

FBI seizes
$700,000 from
Kilpatrick friend
The FBI has seized about
$700,000 from bank accounts
linked to Bobby Ferguson, a close
friend and co-defendant of ex-
Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.
The Detroit News says the
FBI obtained a search warrant
and made the seizures March 10,
one day before a federal jury in
Detroit convicted Ferguson and
Kilpatrick for their roles in a City
Hall kickback scheme. Their sen-
tencing is Oct.10.
The newspaper says search
warrants in the case were
unsealed Friday in Detroit U.S.

Ferguson's lawyer Michael

Budget tightening
could widen

on the fifth anniversary of

President Barack Obama says the

Tryingto layclaimto aneconom-

"We came in, stabilized the

Tropical Storm Manuel edged
onto Mexico's Pacific coast Sun-
day while Hurricane Ingrid
swirled offshore on the other

and landslides caused at least
13 deaths and led authorities to
evacuate thousands.
Stormy conditions led some
communities in affected states
to cancel Independence Day cel-

Monday.
The U.S. National Hurricane
Center said Manuel began to
weaken as soon as it made landfall
near the port of Manzanillo dur-
ing the afternoon, but remained
a threat to produce flash floods
and mudslides. It was predicted
to dissipate by Monday.

in several Michigan communi-
ties, such as Escanaba, Man-
istee, Leland, Southfield and
Detroit.
Aaron Kall, director of the
University's debate program,
said an uncontested primary
presents a rare situation that
can greatly influence the strat-
egy of a race, as Schauer will
likely have the full support of
Democrats across the state.
At this stage in the race, Kall
said a new candidate's best
strategy is visiting counties and
districts - and shaking as many
hands as possible - in an effort
to garner name recognition and
positive media attention.
"Nothing can replace good
old-fashioned campaigning,"
Kall said.
In addition, Schauer has the
opportunity to focus all of his
energy on his likely general
election opponent, Snyder, rath-
er than dueling in a brutal pri-
mary battle.
Primaries tend to force candi-
dates to shift to one side of their
ideology, Kall said, in order to
differentiate themselves from
other challengers.
"Not having primary oppo-
nents allows both candidates to
be who they are, who are very
moderate, in a state that kind
of leans blue, but is purple and
could go either way," Kall said.
Kall said some of Snyder's
policies, such as Medicaid
expansion and the implementa-
tion of the Affordable Care Act,
have angered many subscribers
to the Tea Party faction of the
Republican Party. An issue that

could greatly differentiate Sny-
der and Schauer may arise with
debates concerning labor, ref-
erenced by Snyder's support of
Right-to-Work legislation.
Snyder has also refrained
from speaking on an array of
social issues, instead choosing a
narrative centered on economic
growth for families and busi-
nesses.
Kelli Ford, press secretary for
the Michigan Republican Party,
emphasized Snyder's commit-
ment to rebuilding the economy.
"Right now, Governor Snyder
is focused on doing the job he
was elected to do: build Michi-
gan's comeback," Ford wrote in
a email interview. "New jobs are
being added because Governor
Snyder and the Republican leg-
islature know what it takes to
get our economy back on track."
In a January op-ed published
in the Detroit Free Press, Snyder
cited multiple economic reforms
initiated under his administra-
tion that he said contributed to
Michigan ranking as the sixth
fastest-growing economy in the
nation.
However, Schauer said Sny-
der's economic policies, which
he believes cater to corporate
special interests, have made
it difficult for communities to
remain viable and retain young
people.
"I see Rick Snyder talk-
ing about those things, but his
actions don't back them up,"
Schauer said.
Education, it seems, may also
arise in potential debates as the
electorate begins to pay more
attention to the gubernatorial
race.
Schauer has dedicated mul-
tiple recent op-eds and social
media posts to education-relat-

ed issues. Though Schauer has
not laid out a specific policy
platform, he has a track record
from his time in the state leg-
islature and has recently railed
against Snyder for large-scale
budget cuts in both higher and
k-12 education.
"We need to fundamentally
reconnect to our constitutional
promise of a quality public edu-
cation for every child," Schauer
said. "We need to recommit to
supporting our universities.
We have seen consistent cuts in
state support for higher educa-
tion. I think it should be one of
our values; it should be one of
our top priorities in Michigan."
At the 18th-annual Gover-
nor's Summit on Education
in April, Snyder's comments
focused on better matching
skills with high-demand jobs
through collaboration with
business leaders.
When asked about potential
initiatives to engage college stu-
dents, both Schauer and Ford
emphasized the importance of
involving young voters.
"College students are a
very important demographic,"
Schauer said. "They are engaged
in issues, and their energy is
infectious."
Ford welcomed young Repub-
licans to join campus teams as
part of their effort to recruit
college students from across
Michigan. And in a mid-term
election, lacking a presidential
election to drive turnout, Kall
said engaging voters in every
demographic will be crucial.
In a Detroit Free Press poll
released last week, Snyder is
polling eight points ahead of
Schauer. But with more than a
year to go, the race is far from a
final call.

around campus are especially
difficult for those with physical

working with the University's
Office for Institutional Equality to

has been slow.
The brothers also handed out
fliers to curious passersby. Nurs-
ing sophomore Asa Smith stopped

briefly to chat and offer support.
"When I saw them passing by I
really wondered if they all had dis-

their shirts, and I thought it was
really cool."
Though the 5K is the frater-
nity's most visible event, they also
host other events to raise funds,
including a charity dinner for
students, faculty and community
members with disabilities.
"It's good for us to learn and to
build some solidarity," Guys said.

BUS
From Page 1A
police reported Sunday that all
three have been released.
Police determined that the inci-
dent was not due to operator error
or from excessive speed and said
they didn't know if the bus was
over capacity. Many University
buses are modified to have signifi-
cant standing room.
LSA freshman Tristan MacK-
ethan was on the bus at the time of
the incident. He said the bus was
packed with the usual amount of
students for a game day, and he
did not see anyone standing past
the yellow line thatccautions riders
to stay away from the door.
"As we went around a turn
going left, people were pushed to
the right of the bus ... three people
were pushed against the door, the

doorswere pushed open and three
people fell out," MacKethan said.
He said the bus stopped a short
distance from where the students
fell out, and someone called 911.
Ambulances arrived on the scene
about two or three minutes later.
MacKethan accompanied two
of the victims to the hospital, but
said students were able to take
other buses to the football game.
"Two of the girls are back in our
dorm and they're OK after they
were treated," he said.
As of Sunday evening, the Daily
wasn't able toreachthe twovictims
to which MacKethan referred.
The investigation to deter-
mine the cause of the accident
is still pending, police said. The
bus has been removed from ser-
vice for evaluation of a mechani-
cal failure, and it's not yet clear
when the bus will be back in
service.

Before Oct. 15, teams of stu-
dents will submit their plans
concerning one of the 10 to
20 challenges. Five or six stu-
dent groups, each working
with a faculty member, will
coordinate remotely with the
tech companies during winter

semester before implement-
ing their plan in summer 2014.
The School of Information is
covering travel and housing
expenses, along with provid-
ing a small stipend for partici-
pants to help cover food and
other needs.
Pal said the dynamic
between the Indian organi-
zations and University stu-
dents is different from typical

development opportunities
where external organizations
find an issue and formulate a
plan without local consulta-
tion.
"There is a lot of local com-
munity working on problems
that we can learn from and we
can bring unique skills from the
site itself," Pal said. "This is a
great collaborative opportunity
for us."

ENTREPRENEUR
From Page 1A
said he hopes the class allows his
students to interact meaningfully
with entrepreneurs, who may be
able to offer guidance on how stu-
dents can shape their careers.
Besides listening, students are
also required to pitch their own
idea in front of a camera and sub-
mit it to 1,000 Pitches, n competi-
tion between the University and
Pennsylvania State University
that's hosted by entrepreneur-
ship group MPowered. The goal
of 1,000 Pitches is to encourage
students to turn their ideas into
actual business plans. The winner
of any of the nine pitch categories
is evaluated by a panel and is eli-
gible to receive a $1,000 prize.
While this is only his first year
teaching the seminar, Thompson
has played a prominent role in
the course's evolution. Histori-
cally, the format of the class was
a traditional lecture, with speak-
ers standing behind a lectern and
clicking through a PowerPoint
presentation. However, Thomp-
son felt that speakers were limited
by the formal setting of the course.
"In other words, some entrepre-
neurs are really good at communi-
cating in alecture format, and some
are ... OK at it," Thompson said.
The class "pivoted" toward a
more TEDx style, ditching the
lectern for a more intimate envi-
ronment. Thompson said he began
to notice some recurrring themes
from multiple speakers last year.

"You would start to hear things
like ... 'fail fast, fail early', over
and over again," Thompson said.
Drawing inspiration from "The
Charlie Rose Show," Thompson
proposed another "pivot" - mak-
ing himself a journalistic-style
interviewer to better engage with
the course's guests. With a more
intimate format, Thompson said
there is "a little bit more facility to
draw out who this person really is
and you get some fun stories."
For instance, in response to a
question about how an engineer
becameadoctorandentrepreneur
of homeopathic medicine, Polich
delved into a personal anecdote
about discovering a homeopathic
cure for her sick daughter while at
Whole Foods.
After class, Polich also offered
praiseforthenewinterviewformat.
"The problem is that if I just try
to make something up myself," Pol-
ich said, "it might be the same thing
somebodyelselecturedonlastweek,
but I'm not going to know that -
where he can direct me into specific
areas, which really was helpful."
LSA senior Conrad Brown said
the talk-show format was more
engaging than a traditional lec-
ture and a good way to expose stu-
dents to new business disciplines.
"The talk-show setting is keyto
it not being boring, that you're not
being lectured with a PowerPoint,
like we are in 90 percent of our
other classes," Brown said. "I'd
recommend it to anyone, no mat-
ter what major, what year. If you're
not busy 2 to 3 on Fridays, there's
no reason you shouldn't be here."

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -
Hundreds of people black and
white, many holding hands,
filled an Alabama church that
was bombed by the Ku Klux
Klan 50 years ago Sunday to
mark the anniversary of the
blast that killed four little
girls and became a landmark
moment in, the civil rights
struggle.
The Rev. Arthur Price taught
the same Sunday school lesson
that members of 16th Street
Baptist Church heard the
morning of the bombing - "A
Love That Forgives." Then, the
rusty old church bell was tolled
four times as the girls' names
were read.
Bombing survivor Sarah
Collins Rudolph, who lost her
right eye and sister Addie Mae
Collins in the blast, stood by as
members laid a wreath at the
spot where the dynamite device
was placed along an outside
wall.
Rudolph was 12 at the time,
and her family left the church
after the bombing. She said
it was important to return in
memory of her sister, who was
14, and the three other girls
who died: Carole Robertson
and Cynthia Wesley Morris,
both 14, and Denise McNair, 11.
"God spared me to live and
tell just what happened on that
day," said Rudolph, who tes-
tified against the Klansmen
convicted years later in the
bombing.
Congregation members and
visitors sang the old hymn
"Love Lifted Me" and joined
hands in prayer. The somber
Sunday school lesson was fol-
lowed by a raucous, packed
worship service with gospel
music and believers waving
their hands.
During the sermon, the Rev.
Julius Scruggs of Huntsville,
president of the National Bap-
tist Convention USA, said, "God
said you may murder four little
girls, but you won't murder the
dream of justice and liberty for

all."
Later Sunday, attendees of
an afternoon commemoration
included Attorney General Eric
Holder, Alabama Gov. Robert
Bentley, former U.N. Ambassa-
dor Andrew Young, Jesse Jack-
son, Rev. Joseph Lowery and
director Spike Lee, who made a
documentary about the bomb-
ing.
The church was full, with the
only surviving mother of one of
the girls, Maxine McNair, sit-
ting in the front row.
Holder called the girls'
deaths "a seminal. and tragic
moment" in U.S. history and
recalled gains that followed
their killings like the Civil
Rights Act and the Voting
Rights Act.
Alluding to the Supreme
Court decision this year that
struck down a key part of the
voting law, Holder said the
struggle continues decades
later.
"This a fight that we will
continue," Holder said.
The dynamite bomb went
off outside the church Sept.
15, 1963. Of the Klansmen con-
victed years later, one remains
imprisoned. Two others died in
prison.
Two young men, both black,
were shot to death in Birming-
ham in the chaos that followed
the bombing.
Birmingham was strictly
segregated at the time of the
bombing, which occurred as
city schools were being racially
integrated for the first time.
The all-black 16th Street Bap-
tist was a gathering spot for
civil rights demonstrations for
months before the blast.
The bombing became a pow-
erful symbol of the depth of
racial hatred in the South and
helped build momentum for
later laws, including the 1964
Civil Rights Act and the Voting
Rights Act of 1965.
During the morning com-
memoration, an honor guard
composed of black and whites

officers and firefighters
watched over ceremonies with
mixed-race crowd, something
that would have been unthink-
able in Birmingham in 1963.
That same year, white police
officers and firefighters used
dogs and water hoses on black
demonstrators marching for
equal rights.
President Barack Obama
issued a statement noting that
earlier this year the four girls
were posthumously awarded
the Congressional Gold Medal,
one of the country's highest
civilian honors.

Don't adopt thi~s bill1
State-funded agencies shouldn't be allowed to discriminate
Two bills, introduced in late August and discussed by a
Michigan House of Representatives committee last week,
allow private adoption agencies to refuse to place a child in
the care of a family that contradicts the agency's religious beliefs
or polices, effectively allowing discrimination. Lawmakers could
vote on these bills this week. Although these religiously affiliated
agencies are deemed "private" institutions, the majority of them
utilize public funding. Any agency receiving funding from the state
shouldn't be permitted to place precedence on their own perhaps
discriminatory agenda over the best interest of the adoptees.

Under these bills, agencies may extend
their religious liberties beyond potential
clients of a different faith to include screen-
ing single people or same-sex couples.
Adoptions by same-sex couples are on the
rise and by some are viewed as a much-
needed resource for children in government
care. Bryan Samuels, the commissioner for
the Administration on Children, Youth and
Families, explained in a memo, "The child-
welfare system has come to understand
that placing a child in a gay or lesbian fam-
ily is no greater risk than placing them in a
heterosexual family." The focus of agency
efforts and emphasis should not be placed
on the sexual orientation or religious affili-
ation of prospective parents, but rather if
they can and will provide a positive, nurtur-
ing environment for the adoptees.
The bills, both introduced and sponsored
by Republican state representatives, are just
another example of Republicans allowing
their moral arguments to get in the way of
effective policy. State representatives only
continue to delay any forward movement
or final decision on Common Care funding
- despite the fact that 45 other states have
already adopted the standards. Similarly,
and under the belief that their children and

grandchildren will eventually lie respon-
sible for what state Senator John Moolenaar
deemed the "crushing federal debt" of the
program, Republican representatives vehe-
mently fought Medicaid expansion - until,
of course, it was passed this August with the
potential to aid 320,000 people in the first
year and 470,000 by 2020.
The underlying ethics the bills represent
should neither be ignored nor dismissed.
House Bill no. 4928 would permit an adop-
tion agency the ability to refuse to place a
child with potential parents because the
couple violates the child placing agency's
written religious or moral policies; subse-
quently, House Bill no. 2937 disallows the
government's ability to deny those agen-
cies state funding. Both policies essentially
enable religious discrimination and possi-
ble neglect of the primary purpose of adop-
tion agencies: finding orphaned children
supportive, loving and nurturing families.
The proposed doctrines are fundamentally
unsound, receiving state funding and dis-
crimination should be mutually exclusive-
and adoption agencies that enjoy financial
support of the government should therefore
not also ask to undermine its existing foun-
dational principles.

Why do Republicans hate Presi-
dent Barack Obama?
Conservative readers will likely
find the find the question vacuous:
Why shouldn't they hate Obama?
He's at the masthead of the "sec-
ular-socialist machine," accord-
ing to Newt Gingrich; the "most
radical president" in our country's
history, according to Dick Cheney;
and a "neo-Leninist communist,"
according to the columnist Mychal
Massie. To them, a bottomless con-
tempt for the president is intui-
tive, like an unhealthy interest in
the Old Testament or a fetish for
Milton Friedman. After all, we're
talking about the man who social-
ized medicine, bowed to foreign
powers and played party politics
at the expense of bipartisanship.
For them, the totality of this anti-
American - and connivingly Euro-
pean -agenda can be summed up in
a simple phrase: He's a liberal.
This is really a case of the right
side of the aisle complaining that
they only got half a loaf instead of
the whole; Obama has been nothing
if not amenable to conservatism, an
oddly servile lapdog of what was
the Republican mainstream bare-
ly 15 years ago. So, perhaps some
introspection is required on the
part of the left: Why don't Demo-
crats hate Obama?
Picking on health-care reform
is almost too easy. Older readers
might find the Affordable Care
Act suspiciously familiar, if only
because it's almost a line-by-line
paraphrase of the legislative pro-
posal that Bob Dole ran on when
he was the Republican presidential
candidate in the 1994 election. How
did Dole get away with his apostasy
to Marxism? Well, it might have
something to do with the Heritage
Foundation's endorsement of an
individual mandate in their 1989
article "A National Health System

for America." Or perhaps he was
just taking a page from Gingrich,
the Republican Party's brainiac,
who championed the same policy
when he was speaker of the House
during the Clinton administration.
Single-payer health care has never
been on Obama's lips, let alone his
legislation. Even the Congressional
Progressive Caucus, the Disneyland
of the political left, refuses to call
for what has commendably served
the sick and dying in the Great
White North (and Western Europe,
Australia, Japan...) for decades.

speech, most of you can write this

his off hours genuflectingto Imams
and fellating Latin American dig-
nitaries should've been dispelled
when he carpet bombed Syria six
months ago; anyone who still clings
to this self-serving delusion can
loosen their grip on it now that
pacifism's crown prince has called
for turning Syria's few remaining
buildings into rubble but a day ago.
This is no doubt the thin edge of
the wedge. If Obama is genuinein his
desire to upend Assad's regime, then
a lengthy occupation of the country
will be required, but it's much easier
to sell the conflict as a cheap, nonin-
vasive military exercise that can be
measured in hours instead of years.
Maybe some troops will have to put
their feet on the ground eventually,
but, hey, variables are in flux dur-
ing war. President George W. Bush
said we could tame Iraq in months,
and Democrats laughed. Obama says
that we can leash Syria in days, and
Democrats cheer.
Obama is nothing if not ami-
cable. He compromised with Blue
Dog Democrats and axed the pub-
lic option. He compromised with

Speaker of the House John Boehner
and agreed to mandatory sequestra-
tion. He compromised with House
Republicans and kept almost the
entirety of the Bush tax cuts. Most
recently, he's been pushing for a (no
laughing, please) "Grand Bargain"
on the budget deficit, where slight
increases intax rates arepaired with
savage cuts to welfare and entitle-
ment spending. Republicans, always
the perennial free marketers, don't
seem to be taking the bait, but, much
like gift-giving, it's the thought that
counts. Obama, for whatever rea-
son, is a slave to consensus-building,
to reaching a middle ground even
if that middle is tilted decidedly to
the right. Republicans wring their
hands and gnash theirteeth because
the president hasn't signed on to
every dot and tittle of supply-side
economics, but if laissez-faire is a
house, then he's at least made his
way through the front door and is
snacking in the foyer.
In the spirit of full disclosure,
I'm a liberal, or at least I think I
am. I think "socialized medicine" is
alright, I wish we could stop all this
international fighting and just get
along, and I wish that Democrats
would find their misplaced back-
bones and start throwing punches
for the left-wing again. But really, in
modern political discourse the bar
for what constitutes "liberalism"
has been set so low that it's appli-
cable to almost every politician and
intellectual anywhere at any time.
Nixon? Supported Canadian-style
health care and created the EPA.
Eisenhower? Got big government
involved in public infrastructure.
Buckeley? Advocated pot legaliza-
tion. Goldwater? Wanted federal
same-sex marriage. If these are
liberals, I tremble for who's consid-
ered conservative.

'Tales of Xillia' makes
stateside debut

Dumbledore doesn't look a day over 90.

wzdg

By JULIAN AIDAN
Daily Arts Writer
Being the 13th game in the
expansive "Tales" series, "Xillia"
had alot to live up to: The series
is regarded
as the third B
most impor-
tant world- Tales of
wide, with sales Xillia
exceeding 15
million units. Namco Bandai
Shattering pre-
order records
for the series and receiving criti-
cal acclaimfollowingits Japanese
release in September 2011, "Xil-
lia" appeared to have lived up to
the hype. Almost two years later,
the first copies of "Tales of Xil-
lia" meant for a North American
audience hit shelves nationwide.
As the game starts up, a Jap-
anese pop-rock song sweeps
through your speakers, with art-
ist Ayumi Hamasaki's voice pre-
ceded and supported by soaring
strings. An intro straight out of
an anime, the camera pans over
cute, drawn renditions of the
cast.
Four options, ranging from
"toddler-friendly" to "repetitive-
motion-injury inducing" present
themselves to the player. You're
presented the option of incarnat-
ing one of two protagonists: Jude
Mathis, a promising medical
student, or Milla Maxwell, the
physical incarnation of the Lord
of Spirits. The former is a nerdy
brawler with an awesome habit
of punching people out, the latter
is an elemental spirit-summoning
deity of sorts with hair that defies
conventions like gravity and
logic.
In Rieze Maxia, the isolated
land where "Xillia" takes place,
two nations - Rashugal and Auj
Oule - enjoy an unstable peace.
Jude, spurred by the disappear-
ance of his professor, stumbles
upon Milla trying to enter the
very military research facility
Jude was headed toward. With-
in, they find Spyrix technology:
Advanced and dangerous weap-
onry with the potential to destroy
the world as they know it.
As the story unfolds, the pair
encounters a diverse cast of
friends and foes - stalkers, mer-
cenaries, kings bent on world
domination - in the ultimate
goal of maintaining stability

New spinoff film to
feature fresh
cast of characters
By REBECCA GODWIN
Daily Arts Writer
I heard the news in three
parts. Part One: J.K. Rowling
was going to be writing a screen-
play for Warner Brothers. My
excitement level was fairly low,
as I hadn't been all that thrilled
with Rowling's work since
"Harry Potter."
Part Two: The screenplay was
just the first in a series she would
be writing for the film studio.
My excitement level increased a
bit as I thought of all the possi-
bilities for the films.
Part Three: The series of
movies would neither be sequels
nor prequels to the "Harry Pot-
ter" stories, but would still take
place in the magical world she
had created. The first film of the
series will focus on Newt Sca-
mander, the author of Hogwarts
textbook "Fantastic Beasts and
Where to Find Them."
At this point, the HP fan-girl
inside of me was having a disco
party intermixed with minor
bouts of cardiac arrest. The day
I had been waiting for since the
last HP movie premiered was
imminent and I had never been
happier.
Once I had calmed myself a
bit and my head no longer felt
bogged down by a confundus

charm, I began to think over
the news. Was I ready to re-
enter this magical world? I had
started reading the HP books in
the second grade and, for almost
12 years, they had been a place
where I could escape and dream
and imagine. It had taken me a
while to accept the fact that the
series was done, to accept the
fact that my childhood was over.
Would I be able to go on this
crazy broomstick ride again?
The answer is yes. Always.
But while I may be ready to dive
back into the wizarding world,
some are concerned Rowling
is only using these screenplays
to return to her HP days of
glory, especially after her first
non-magic related novel was
considered such a huge disap-
pointment. My answer to such
allegations: perhaps. But does it
really matter?
When HP ended, the world
over screamed, cried and begged
for more stories. A sequel about
the Trio's children or a prequel
about the Marauders' time at
Hogwarts - the fans were will-
ing to take anything so long as
the magic didn't end. But Row-
ling said no. She said she had
plenty of stories she could write,
plenty of background and histo-
ry on all the characters that the
fans never knew (some of which
has been slowly released in the
last couple years on Rowling's
Pottermore site, which offers
tons of new, exclusive informa-
tion), but she wanted to stop.
Now she's back and people are

Is video-game snow good packing snow?

questioning her motives? They
need to sort out their priorities.
I, for one, completely trust
Rowling and her decisions. She
never once, throughout the
whole HP series, disappointed
me (though she did try her best
to make me sob with each char-
acter she killed off - some of
whom I still refuse to believe
are actually dead and not simply
kicking ass in an intense game
of hide-and-seek).
The world she created was
so extensive that there are
hundreds of opportunities for
new stories that can be com-
pletely unrelated to Harry Pot-
ter and his friends, but which
are equally as enchanting and
enthralling. As a writer, I do
not believe that Rowling would
ever try to disrupt the canon or
exploit her original creation.
She is simply branching out
from the very sturdy trunk she's
already grown.
As for the movie, I hope that a
couple familiar faces pop up. At
least Dumbledore, who seemed
practically 1,000 years old when
he died (actually, he was 114, in
case you were wondering), could
make a brief appearance.
As for what else I want in the
movie, well, I really couldn't
care less because I'm just happy
the world that I love so much is
coming back. But I guess we all
should have seen this coming,
as the things we lose have a way
of "coming back to us" in the
end, if not always in the way we
expected.

chopaths? Or is
there always another, more com-
plex explanation? "The Attack"
delicately delves into these ques-
tions, and the result is a bare por-
trayal of a woman conflicted and
the man who loved her.
Amin Jafaari (Ali Suliman,
"Under the Same Sun") is a Pales-
tinian surgeon living in Tel Aviv
- well respected and accepted
by the Jewish society that sur-
rounds him. Soon after the film
begins, a suicide bomb detonates
close to his hospital, killing 17
and injuring countless victims
who are rushed to his operating
room. His efficiency and dig-
nity are evident as he saves life
after life, only stopping when an
injured Israeli man screams that
he does not want Amin - an Arab
- as his doctor.
Hours later, exhausted and
beleaguered, Amin discovers that
his wife Sahim (Reymond Amsa-
lem, "Plasticine") was found dead
in the attack. We see her body
bluntly torn in two, her torso
lying meekly under a sheet in
the morgue. And as Amin pulled
shrapnel from children, hiswife's
body was floors below him, being
identified as the perpetrator of
the attack.
Director and screenwriter

spend much time establishing

Look at this photograph.
world before it is explosively dis-
assembled, so he uses flashbacks
in Amin's gold-tinged memory to
create his wife, Sahim. Douieri
worked as a cameraman for Quen-
tin Tarantino, and his tutelage
shows, each shot perfectly fram-
ing the before and after of Amin's
life. Sahim, a liberal Palestinian,
is for the majority of the film a
beautiful enigma, defined by her
soulful glances and overly script-
ed declarations against Israel. As
Amin searches for answers, we
sense that he is discovering just
as we are: The question becomes
not about Sahim's innocence, but
one of Amin himself. How could
he love her so deeply yet know
nothing of the dark resentments
beneath her beautiful face?
The film masquerades as
being marked by contrasts: shiny
Tel Aviv with archaic Pales-
tine; Amin's granite-countered,
stainless-steeled mansion with
his humble birthplace; Sahim the
dream girl vs. Sahim the mass
murderer. However, all these dis-
tinctions mask the real ambigu-
ity of the film, as Amin unravels
the real complexity of Sahim's
political beliefs.
Suliman shines as Jaafari,
using masculine brevity to por-
tray the pillar of strength he
was before the attack. He shows
Amin's anguish through subtle
gestures: a downturned head,

a blank stare that lasts a second
too long. These little actions are
often drowned out by the script's
creative view of what "grief"
is. Amin constantly imagines
the living memory of his wife
standing next to him, a falter-
ing attempt to build her char-
acter without using flashbacks.
The film is strongest when Amin
bares everything - his anger,
confusion and all-consuming
grief - but it sometimes drifts
into symbolic theatrics.
Amin is interrogated, he is
pitied, he is rejected from a soci-
ety that once granted him spe-
cial access, and at the same time
distanced from his birthplace
because he betrayed them so
long ago. He is a man who once
had everything: a beautiful wife,
fulfilling career, wealth and most
importantly, a valued place in
a society that normally doesn't
accept people like him.
While "The Attack" grace-
fully examines how Amin reacts
when his entire life is upended,
it focuses on the reasons some-
one like Sahim would throw it
all away, sacrificing her life and
countless others to a cause she
can't even admit to her husband.
"The Attack" is powerful, and
while its consequences linger, the
audience never fully understands
the most burning question: Who
is Sahim Jaafari?

TODD NEEDLE/Daily
The Michigan student section (top) was stunned as Akron approached a near-upset. Redshirt junior quarterback Devin Gardner (left) committed four turnovers. Fifth-year senior running back Fitzgerald Toussaint found little room on the inside.

By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
Quarterback Devin Gardner,
who had four turnovers, called it
the worst game he has played at
any level. Captain Taylor Lewan
called it an "embarrassment" to
the Michigan football program,
which "works too hard to have
games like this." Coach Brady
Hoke said it's like a college final
- how much you study, or pre-

pare, will dictate the outcome.
The Wolverines were not
prepared for Saturday's game
against Akron, and it showed.
Had it not been for a last-sec-
ond goal-line stand, Michigan's
season that started almost per-
fectly would have been spoiled
before Big Ten play even began.
Instead, the Wolverines held
on for dear life, avoiding one of
the worst losses in the history of
the Big House by beating Akron
28-24 and remaining unblem-

ished on the season.
"It was embarrassing," said
Lewan, an offensive tackle. "We
didn't prepare. This is on the
seniors and the leadership of
this team."
Junior linebacker Desmond
Morgan stuffed Zips running
back Jawon Chisholm on 3rd-
and-goal from the 1-yard line
for a loss of two. Then with the
final seconds ticking off, anoth-
er junior linebacker, Brennan
Beyer, hit Akron quarterback

Kyle Pohl, causing his pass to
fall harmlessly to the ground in
the end zone.
Hoke said he knew that
defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison's final play call would
be cable zero train, a blitz. Beyer
turned around, saw his team-
mates celebrating and knew
Michigan had survived.
To set up the improbable stop,
Zips quarterback Kyle Pohl, who
threw for 311 yards, hit receiver
L.T. Smith for 15 yards and was

ruled down just shy of the goal
line.
Earlier in the drive, the Wol-
verines forced Akron into a 3rd-
and-S situation, butlike they did
so many times Saturday, the Zips
turned it into a conversion and
a sizeable gain. Overall, Akron
was 9-for-18 on third downs.
"The problem is not tight
enough coverage, not fitting the
run well enough and no pass
pressure," Hoke said.
Trailing 21-17, Akron sus-

tained an 11-play, 67-yard drive
that included two of those nine
third-down conversions and
ended in a one-yard touchdown
pass.
Michigan got the ball back
with about four minutes to go in
the game and needed only four
plays to cover 70 yards. Gardner

This team was flat and boring
and unable to execute anything

This team made the Zips
look competitive, never mind
the fact that Akron now has a

tackle, blamed iton the seniors
and the leadership of the team,
who he said were responsible
for a poor week of preparation
during practice.
He didn't blame his quar-

Gardner, who had four turn-

Akron back in the game with
an awful pick-six on the second
play of the fourth quarter.
Nor did he blame the sec-

and the past is everywhere in

was built in Fielding Yost's

That's the allure of Michigan,

still no Rose Bowls. And then
an Akron team even worse than
Appalachian State threatened to
start the nightmare over again.
On the bus to the game, the
Akron coaching staff showed
the game tape of Michigan's
game against Notre Dame.
They weren't analyzing plays
or looking for tendencies. They
wanted to show their players
how emotionally drainingthat
game was for Michigan. They
wanted to show them Michigan
couldn't possibly come out with
that same intensity two weeks
in a row.
Akron understood. Part of
the deal of 20-year-olds playing
football is that sometimes they
don't show up. All that's left is to
survive and move on.
There's not much to learn
from a game like this. Does
Michigan seem like a worse
team than last week?
In the locker room after the
game, Hoke gathered his team
and spoke, his voice growing
more hoarse as he went on.
"No.1 goal is to do what?" he
said.
"Win," the team said.
"Did we win?"
"Yessir."
"That's the good part," Hoke
said. "That's the good part."
Michigan managed to out-
run its past, even if just by four
yards. For players after the
game, it hardly seemed like a
win. But the Wolverines have
now survived 315 Saturdays
since the worst loss in program
history. That's the only good
part, but that's the only part that
matters.

Five things we learned: Akron

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
1. Devin Gardner giveth, and
Devin Gardner taketh away
The redshirt junior quar-
terback had 83 percent of
Michigan's total yards on Sat-
urday, continuing his role as the
backbone of the offense. He's
immensely talented and athletic
- the Wolverines' offense would
look a lot different (read: worse)
without him.
But so far this season, there's
been at least one play a game
that a Pop Warner quarterback
shouldn't be making, much less a
collegiate quarterback who was
expected to be in contention for
the Heisman Trophy before the
season.
Against Notre Dame, it was
an interception in the end zone
that let the Fighting Irish back
into the game. Saturday, it was
an awful pass into the flat that
was again returned for a pick-
six. It was his fourth turnover of
the day and immediately brought
Akron back into the game. With-
out that play from Gardner, a
goal-line stand likely wouldn't

have been needed. If Michigan
is going to win a Big Ten champi-
onship, he will have to be better
than that.
Earlier in the season, Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke said that
Gardner's talent is both a bless-
ing and a curse. It allows for
his quarterback to make insane,
remarkable plays, but it also lets
Gardner believe he can do any-
thing and that mistakes are for
other people.
Michigan's season depends
on whether he can find the line
between talented and mistake-
prone.
"I wasn't myself today," Gard-
ner said after the game Saturday.
"I made a lot of mistakes today.
It was probably my worst game
ever, but it won't happen again."
2. The offensive line isn't quite
there
Fifth-year senior offensive
tackle Taylor Lewan was furi-
ous after the game, to the point
where he told reporters, "You
all don't even know. You all just
write shit down."
He was angry because he felt
leadership from upperclassmen

was lacking on Saturday, but also
because he felt like the offensive
line wasn't doing anything to
help the running game.
"Being the one offensive tack-
le on this team, I put that offen-
sive performance on myself," he
said. "Devin didn't have enough
time to throw. Our running
backs didn't have holes. That's
my fault."
It wasn't entirely his fault,
obviously, but the offensive line
didn't look like a finished group
Saturday. For the second straight
game, fifth-year senior running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint ran for
71 yards. He had a few long runs
but was bottled up for the most
part.
That was acceptable against
Notre Dame, a team with one
of the best defensive lines in
the country. It was not against
Akron.
Lewan and fellow fifth-year
senior Michael Schofield form
one of the best offensive tackle
duos in the Big Ten, but the inte-
rior line is incredibly inexperi-
enced and raw.
We'll see in the next couple
weeks whether it's a matter of
cohesion and inexperience or if
it's smatter of talent. If theo inte-

a

it' a matter of talent. If the inte-
rior line doesn't play well against
USE E Connecticut next week, offen-
m iim i sive coordinator Al Borges might
look to shake up the group.
3. Paging Frank Clark
6 2 3 1 Junior defensive end Frank
Clark said before the season that
9 3 7 his goal was 10 sacks. He was
supposed to be a wrecking ball
on a unit that looked devilish and
2 4 deep in the firstgame of the year
against Central Michigan.
9 7 6 Yet for all the talk before the
season, Clark still doesn't have
a sack. He's the biggest disap-
4 7 3 5 pointment on a struggling unit
that hurried Akron quarterback
3 8 1 Tyler Pohl but, for the second
straight week, didn't record a
8 1 sack.
Pohl - just like Notre Dame
quarterback Tommy Rees the
3 7 9 week before - had all the time in
the world to throw in the pocket.
6 5 1 7 The defensive line played best
when it had to, in the red zone,
' Ibut it'sthe first 80 yards that
raised warning flags Saturday.

TODDNEEDLE/Daily
Redshirt junior quarterback Devin Gardner had four turnovers on Saturday, including a crucial pick-six in the fourth quarter.

4. The secondary doesn't have
Greg Mattison's trust yet
Part of the blame for the sec-
ondary's struggles can be placed
on the defensive line. The more
pressure they apply, the easier
the secondary's job is.
That doesn't let the unit off
the hook. Akron passed for more
than 300 yards, becoming the
second team ina row to do that to
Michigan. Starting junior safety
Raymon Taylor was beaten sev-
eral times on deep routes, and
Mattison had to rely on fresh-
man Jourdan Lewis and junior
Delonte Hollowell, both of whom
played more of a reserve role the

first two games of the year.
If Mattison trusted this group
more, he could dial up more blitz-
es to help apply pressure that the
defensive line so far cannot. But
because he understandably can't,
the two units struggled together
Saturday.
If one of these units improves,
the other one will, too.
5. Bold Prediction: Gardner
will throw at least one intercep-
tion in every game this year
Again, Michigan's offense
would be a lot less exciting and
impactful without Gardner. His
primary backup is a true fresh-


man - Michigan needs him.
But if Gardner is throw-
ing three interceptions against
Akron, what happens in Big Ten
games or games on the road?
Unless Gardner has a sudden
awareness epiphany, his false
sense of security will always be
there.
Maybe the revelation willhap-
pen soon, but it's far more likely
that the trend of Gardner making
one big mistake per game contin-
ues.
He will have stunning per-
formances, but ultimately, every
Saturday will end with at least
one pick from Michigan's most
dynamic playmaker.

As the first half wound down
Sunday, frustration began to set
in for the Michigan field hock-
ey team. Another missed shot,
another groan from the crowd
and yet another scream of disgust
from the Wolverines.
Michigan had outshot Califor-
nia-Davis 18-3 in the first half and
had just a 2-1 lead to show for it.
One week after failing to convert
against No. 18 Wake Forest, it
looked like history was destined
to repeat itself.
But
Michi- LOUISVILLE 0
gan's 19th MICHIGAN 1
shot of the
afternoon UC DAVIS 1
changed its MICHIGAN 6
fortunes,
as sophomore forward Shannon
Scavelli's goal broke the game
open for the Wolverines (3-3) and
sparked a 6-1 rout of the Aggies
(1-4). The win was the second
in as many days for Michigan at
Ocker Field. After falling to a dis-
appointing 1-3 start on the road,
Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz
knew it was important for her
team to gain some momentum by
winning at home.
"It's good for our confidence,"
Pankratz said. "We have a lot of
talent and depth, but we also have
a lot of youth. So it's important
that when they go in the game
they're confident and know that
they can play against anybody."
After a sluggish opening few
minutes against UC Davis that
put Michigan behind early, 1-0,
the Wolverines picked up the
tempo. Following the UC Davis
goal, the Wolverines tacked on
two goals off corners, grabbing a
lead they would never relinquish.
"Early on we were settling
into their game," said senior for-
ward Rachael Mack. "We were a
little lackadaisical, but after fall-
ing behind we were able to turn
it around and play our game. We
were able to play to our intensity,
our pace, and do what we want to

do, not what they wanted to do."
With just over three minutes
remaining in the half, a high chip
shot delivered by Scavelli near
the right goalpost sailed over the
UC Davis goalie and was tipped
by Mack into the left corner of
the net. With the goal, Michigan
extended its lead to two goals, and
the blowout was on.
Mack continued her strong
season in which she has carried
the load on offense as the teams'
leading goal-scorer. This week-
end showed a more giving side for
Mack, as she totaled four assists
on the weekend compared to just
one goal.
"It was a good team effort,"
Pankratz said. "We had a lot of

diversity, depth and versatility in
our goal-scoring. Rachael Mack
is our best firepower scorer and
so she gets double - even triple-
teamed a lot - so it's nice to see
other people stepping up in that
department.
"To see her being unselfish
speaks to the fact that she's a great
captain and a great leader and
the other players responded by
putting it in. Hopefully they can
become dangerous scorers them-
selves and really gain some confi-
dence in the next few games."
The second half proved to be
all Michigan, as it outshot the
Aggies 14-2 in the second half and
was able to control possession for
the entire half. More importantly,

it found the back of the net three
more times in the second half to
extend the lead to five.
Sunday was one of two games
this weekend, as the Wolverines
faced off against No. 16 Louis-
ville - the fourth ranked team
Michigan has played in five games
- Saturday. Junior midfielder
Ainsley McCallister led the way
against the Cardinals, scoring the
lone goal as the Wolverines won
the contest, 1-0.
"Everyone loves winning at
home," Mack said. "It does great
things for the younger player's
confidence when everyone's
involved. As much as I love scor-
ing goals, others have to do it too,
so I'm happy taking the backseat

VOLLEYBALL
From Page 1B
scored 15 points off of 13 kills -
put the Wolverines away, 15-13.
"(Florida State) played very
well, and we could have played
a little bit better," said Michi-
gan coach Mark Rosen. "We
had played three games in 24
hours, so we were tired. This
weekend exposed us alittle and
gave us a lot of information.
We come back with alot more
information and direction into
what we need to do totake our-
selves to the nextlevel."
The Wolverines needed
five sets to complete a come-
back victory over Texas A&M
in their second match Friday.
Having fallen quietly to the
Aggies in the first set, Michigan
earned a 24-18 lead off stellar
blocking from Toon and sopho-
more middle blocker Krystalyn
Goode. Despite a 6-0 Aggie run
to tie the game at 24, akill from
freshman outside hitter Abby
Cole and a Texas A&M attack
error tied the match at one set
apiece.
Despite hitting just .220 as
a team in the third set, Michi-
gan took an easier 25-20 victory
and a one-game advantage over
the Aggies. In it, Goode - who
recorded a season-high seven
blocks and three of the Wolver-
ines' five solo stuffs - contrib-
utedfiveofhereightkillsonthe
night.
But Texas A&M would serve
the same score back to Michi-
gan in the fourth set, forcing
a 15-point tiebreaker in the
final set. Texas A&M outside
hitter Angela Lowak gave the
Aggies a four-point lead early
on, from which the Wolverines
would never recover. In the
fifth set, Michigan was forced
to play comeback when, down
13-11 and facing a match point,
Toon's team-high 12th kill put
the ball back in the hands of
junior setter Lexi Dannemi-
ller for the serve. Down 13-12,
Dannemiller's ace tied the set
before akill fromGoode put the
Wolverines within one point of
the match. A second Dannemi-
ller ace secured the 15-13 win,
and Michigan's seventh of the
season.
Of course, Dannemiller

could only deliver after getting
in the zone.
"I was on the bench and Tim,
our trainer, meditates with us
in the morning, so he told me
to just focus on my breathing,"
Dannemiller said. "That's what
I did, so I was just lucky to get
the ball where it landed."
Several new Wolverine faces
saw time against Siena in the
first match of the weekend.
Among them, sophomore set-
ter Carly Warner - in her first
appearance this season - con-
tributed 28 assists and six digs
in place of Dannemiller. Michi-
gan never trailed Siena while
resting multiple key starters
and substituting 15 players,
taking the match in three sets,
25-14,25-17,25-17.
"Whenever we put someone
else in, we know that they can
play as well as they do in prac-
tice," Dannemiller said. "Hav-
ing everyone come in and be
supportive of each other was
cool. It was fun to see Carly run
an offense because she did a
really great job."
The trio of freshman mid-
dle blocker Gaby Bulic and
sophomores Ally Davis and
Kelly Murphy combined for 10
of Michigan's 44 kills on the
match. Redshirt sophomore
middle blocker Olivia Reed
added a block in the second set
of the match, putting the Wol-
verines up 15-7. From Siena,
Rosen and his squad learned
that the second string can win.
But from Florida State, they
learned there are no second
chances against a Top-25 team.
"We need depth," Rosen
said. "That's what's going to
keep us going through a long
season. But that doesn't mean
that we can sleep against some
teams and snap back to beat
elite teams. We know now what
we need to work on to move to
that next level."
Note: Two Michigan middle
blockers had career days Fri-
day. Goode finished with a sea-
son-high 10 kills, while senior
co-captain middle blocker
Jennifer Cross moved into sole
possession of third place on the
program's career total blocks
list with 437. Both Cross and
Dannemiller were selected to
the Texas A&M Invitational
All-Tournament team.

COOK
From Page 1B
Lewan could only blame his
seniors, the backbone of this
team who are theoretically the
reliable ones.
"If any guy on this team
thinks they can do anything but
prepare every single week - you
have to take this as your job,"
Lewan said. "You came here
as a student-athlete. You go to
school, get your degree and win
Big Ten Championships. If we
prepare like we did this week,
we won't win another game."
Saturday should and could
be nothing but a wake-up call.
Maybe it's exactly what this
young team needed - a strong
punch to the gut, an awakening.
It's easy to see how this
could be a let down game. Last
weekend was incredible. There
was nothing special about this
Saturday, a noon game against
a middling MAC team with a
lackluster crowd and half-empty
student section. But that type
of letdown game only lasts to a

certain point. It shouldn't, and
can't, last until the last play of
the game against the worst team
on Michigan's schedule.
If Lewan is right, if there
is a lack of leadership, that's
a much bigger deal than just
playing down to an opponent.
Leadership is what will carry
this team in November, when
the Wolverines play three road
games in four weeks, or during
Thanksgiving weekend against
Ohio State.
"Tuesday and Wednesday,
we had back-to-back 90-degree
days and some of the guys were
kind of lacking," said fifth-year
safety Thomas Gordon. "(Lewan
is) absolutely right. It's leader-
ship. We preached it all week,
but obviously there were dif-
ferent circumstances today. We
didn't execute."
The last play, the one that
saved Saturday, was an incom-
plete pass from the four-yard
line, Akron's second big missed
opportunity of the day. Twice,
the Zips had the ball on Michi-
gan's one, and twice, they failed
to convert.

and getting the assists."
After gaining momentum and
confidence in the return home,
Michigan will put it all to the test
as they head east yet again, this
time to visit William & Mary on
Friday and future Big Ten rival
Maryland on Sunday. Pankratz
said both teams play faster and
stronger than Louisville or UC
Davis, and her team will have to
come prepared.
But all the preparation and
talent in the world doesn't win
games - execution does. Despite
the two wins this weekend, Pan-
kratz remains unsatisfied. She
knows her team must learn to
capitalize quickly if they want the
wins to continue.
Junior linebacker Brennan
Beyer broke through the line
and sent Akron quarterback Kyle
Pohl back toward the field and
away from the end zone, back
to a place where this Michigan
football team is still undefeated
and didn't lose to a middling
MAC team.
It was a win, the same as
Notre Dame and the same as
Central Michigan.
But Lewan didn't go to the
student section after this win.
He went straight to the under-
belly of the stadium, away from
the field, where the only word
he could think of was "embar-
rassing" and where he had more
questions than answers.
"I'm not here to celebrate
that type of game or that type of
preparation," Lewan said. "We
have a lot of work to do if we
want to accomplish our goals.
This senior class, we've worked
too hard, way too hard, to have
games like this."

CAUGHT
From Page 1B
running back Fitzgerald Tous-
saint punched it in from two
yards out with just under three
minutes to go, regaining the lead
before Pohl resumed his meticu-
lous assault on the Michigan
defense.
It was because of Gardner's
mistakes - not unlike the atro-
cious one he made in his own end
zone against Notre Dame last
weekend resulting in a Fighting
Irish touchdown - that Akron
found itself in the game late.
Gardner's fourth turnover of
the game, yet another inexcus-
able decision by the redshirt
junior, came just when it looked
like the Wolverines might be able
to pull away.
Facing significant pressure
on the second play of the fourth
quarter, Gardner hurled the ball
right at Zips linebacker Justin
March on a screen pass. He trot-
ted 30 yards for a touchdown,
pulling Akron to within four ina
mostly silent Michigan Stadium.
As a team, Michigan managed

a grand total of 19 first-half rush-
ing yards. But after an Akron
-touchdown to start the third
quarter - a 28-yard strike from
quarterback Kyle Pohl to Zach
D'Orazio sucked the noise out of
the Big House - the Wolverines'
offense finally showed signs of
life.
On that next drive, Michigan
briefly resembled the team that
put 41 points up on Notre Dame
the weekend before. It took just
three plays - including a 24-yard
rush from fifth-year senior run-
ning back Fitzgerald Toussaint
that more than doubled the
team's total rushing yards -
for the Wolverines to pull back
ahead. Redshirt junior quarter-
back Devin Gardner kept the ball
himself on a read option and ran
36 yards for the go-ahead touch-
down.
But what Gardner had failed to
do on an earlier read option was
part of the reason the Wolverines
found themselves in such a pre-
dicament in the first place. Early
in the second quarter, Michi-
gan moved the ball to the Akron
10-yard line, but Gardner chose
to keep the ball instead of pitch it

to his tailback and ended up los-
ing the football.
A Blake Countess interception,
the redshirt sophomore's third in
two games, gave Gardner the ball
right back. But two incomple-
tions followed by an interception
immediately swung momentum
back in the Zips' favor, keeping
hope alive in the hearts of the
heavy underdogs.
On the next Michigan drive,
Gardner needed only two pass
attempts to find a Zips defender,
this time off a deflection.
A 48-yard touchdown pass
from Gardner to sophomore tight
end Devin Funchess early in the
game made it appear the Wolver-
ines could score at will on Akron.
But that would be the extent of
the Wolverines' scoring in the
first half.
Meanwhile, the turnovers that
have haunted Gardner's tenure
as Michigan quarterback con-
tinued into the second half, giv-
ing an equally lethargic Akron
offense opportunity after oppor-
tunity.
"I'll be thinking all night about
why he made a couple of the deci-
sions that he did," Hoke said.
