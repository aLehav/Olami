Arraignment 
results in 
Sept. 9 date for 
pre-trial

On 
Monday 
morning, 
six 
demonstrators 
charged 
with 
trespassing 
from 
March’s 
Climate Strike appeared in court 
for the first time. All parties 
pleaded not guilty to the charges 
and the pre-trial was set for Sept. 
9 at 9 a.m.
On 
March 
15, 
2019, 
10 
individuals, 
including 
two 
minors, 
were 
arrested 
and 
given citations for trespassing 
following 
a 
seven-hour 
sit-
in at Fleming Administration 
Building. Demonstrators, who 
came 
from 
the 
Washtenaw 
County Climate Strike earlier 
that day, refused to leave until 
administration addressed a list 
of demands, which included a 
one-hour public meeting with 
University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel in which questions 
regarding the University’s plan 
to address climate change and 

carbon 
neutrality 
were 
not 
screened beforehand.
In a March 21 letter addressed 
to members of the Climate 
Action 
Movement, 
Schlissel 
responded to the requests of the 
demonstrators, where he said 
the University has been “actively 
engaging” 
with 
community 
members and Climate Action 
Movement organizers on issues 
regarding carbon neutrality.
“To achieve our shared goal 
of carbon neutrality as soon as 
possible, it is essential that the 
community engage in identifying 
and understanding the challenges 
and contributing to the solutions 
necessary to convert from fossil 
fuels to non-carbon sources of 
energy,” Schlissel wrote. “I will 
continue to look for opportunities 
to engage with your membership 
and the broader community on 
these issues — everyone has a role 
to play.”
Following 
the 
Climate 
Strike, Schlissel held a public 
meeting on April 9 to discuss the 
University’s actions to address 
climate change. Issues discussed 
at the meeting included divesting 
from fossil fuels and the makeup 
of the President’s Commission 
on Carbon Neutrality, which 
includes 
energy 
industry 
representatives.
Two months after the Climate 
Strike, all individuals except the 

two minors were charged with 
trespassing misdemeanors. The 
trespassing complaint is identical 
in all cases, and the maximum 
sentence that can be imposed is 
$250 fine and/or 30 days in jail.
When asked about the decision 
to 
charge 
demonstrators, 
University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen wrote in an email to 
The Daily the University does not 
decide whether to bring criminal 
charges and directed The Daily 
to 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 
prosecutor’s office. 
“Thousands 
of 
students 
participate 
in 
the 
climate 
action rally without incident,” 
Broekhuizen 
wrote. 
“Hundreds 
others 
protested 
in the president’s office in the 
following weeks. Still others 
addressed the Board of Regents 
in public meetings. Only a small 
number are now facing charges 
because they refused to leave 
the Fleming Building.”
In response to why the office 
pressed charges, Steven Hiller, 
chief 
assistant 
Washtenaw 
County prosecuting attorney, 
wrote in an email to The Daily 
the prosecutor’s office cannot 
discuss the facts of a case before 
it is adjudicated to respect the 
defendant’s right to a fair trial. 

District judge 
files response 
to ‘U’ petition

Response criticizes 
attempts from ‘U’ 
lawyers to excuse 
Schlissel from court

U.S. District Judge Arthur Tarnow 
responded to an order from the 
U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals 
on Monday afternoon, criticizing 
University of Michigan attorneys 
for not participating in “good faith” 
and accusing the University of going 
“extraordinary” lengths to ensure 
President Mark Schlissel did not have 
to publicly appear in court during the 
ongoing Doe v. University of Michigan 
lawsuit.
“The University’s attorneys appear 
to be more concerned with keeping 
the President out of the public eye 
than with prompt resolution of this 
case and providing a fair process 
for adjudicating sexual misconduct 
claims,” Tarnow wrote.
Tarnow’s response is filed after the 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals granted 
a last-minute appeal by the University 
to delay the June 13 public settlement 
conference for the lawsuit at which 
Schlissel was scheduled to appear. 
In the response, Tarnow addressed a 
University petition filed at the same 
time asking the Sixth Circuit Court to 
not require Schlissel’s attendance and 
move the conference off-the-record 
and closed to the public.
Deborah Gordon, the plaintiff’s 
attorney, has not yet filed a response. 
In the order, Raymond Kethledge, 
circuit judge for the U.S. Sixth District 
Court of Appeals, requested responses 
from Gordon and Tarnow within 
10 days and wrote the settlement 
conference would be delayed until 
further notice.

‘U’ hosts STEM 
diversity plenary

SEISMIC 
conference holds 
first annual summer 
meeting

SEISMIC, 
a 
coalition 
of 
American research institutions 
striving 
to 
create 
more 
accessible STEM curriculum to 
underrepresented minorities, held 
its first annual summer meeting 
this week on the University of 
Michigan campus. Funded by a 
grant from the Alfred P. Sloan 
foundation in November, the 
project’s emergence culminated 
this week in a conference, uniting 
all participants for the first time.
Over four days, nearly 40 
representatives 
from 
the 
10 
participating universities, which 
collectively enroll about 350,000 
students, gathered to discuss 
how to foster a mindset in which 
STEM is a viable course of study 

for anyone who wishes to pursue 
it.
SEISMIC 
director 
Tim 
McKay, University professor of 
physics and associate chair for 
the 
undergraduate 
program, 
welcomed the group Tuesday 
evening at the Michigan League. 
McKay explained he and others 
had been traveling since February 
to nine of the 10 participating 
schools, 
meeting 
with 
representatives and introducing 
the project to administrators and 
students.
“The most important goal of 
this … in-person meeting, is to 
make this collaboration real,” 
McKay said. “To form the kinds 
of 
personal 
connections 
and 
commitments to one another 
which will let us accomplish some 
of our most ambitious dreams.”
McKay said he realized over the 
course of his travels how difficult 
STEM 
diversity 
improvement 
would be to achieve. 

Community 
members congregate 
on Diag Saturday 
afternoon 

On 
Saturday 
afternoon, 
about 50 people gathered in 
front of the Federal Building 
in Ann Arbor for the Rally to 
Impeach 
Trump. 
The 
event 
was part of a nationwide day, 
titled #ImpeachTrump: Act to 
Defend 
Democracy, 
planned 
by Move On, By the People and 
other organizations including 
Women’s March.
P. Deisha Myles, community 
activist 
and 
anti-fracking 
advocate, acted as lead organizer 
of the rally.
“I’m hoping that we can 
persuade 
Debbie 
Dingell 
to 
support 
the 
impeachment 
inquiry begun by Rashida Tlaib,” 
Myles told the Daily. “The longer 
(Donald Trump is) in office, the 
more people are being genuinely 
hurt.”
Before the event, attendees 
gathered 
to 
make 
signs. 
Afterwards, they stood by the 
street holding up their signs. 
Attendees took turns using a 
megaphone to lead chants, such 
as “Call Pelosi, impeach Trump,” 
and “Trump is not above the 
law.”
The 
event 
then 
officially 
began 
with 
a 
speech 
from 

Eli Savit, a professor at the 
University of Michigan Law 
School and a 2020 Washtenaw 
Prosecutor 
candidate. 
He 
discussed Trump’s past actions 
and controversies, like “Trump 
University,” before calling for 
Trump’s impeachment.
“It is crucial for the rule of law 
that we do this,” Savit said. “If we 
do not impeach Donald Trump, 
we are sending the message not 
just today, but for generations 
that if you are rich, and if you are 
powerful ... then you are above 
the law. That you won’t be held 
to account. And not only that — 
that nobody will even try.”
He 
concluded 
by 
urging 
Congress to take action.
“Donald Trump took an oath 
to faithfully execute the laws of 
the United States. So did every 
member of Congress,” Savit said. 
“Donald Trump has failed that 
oath. Congress needs to abide it.”
Myles 
spoke 
about 
her 
advocacy work for immigration 
and indigenous rights before 
reading from a speech she had 
previously presented to State 
Rep. Laurie Pohutsky, D-Livonia.
“I’m the granddaughter of a 
survivor of an Indian boarding 
school 
and 
I 
see 
alarming 
parallels to that time and today 
… Going after the children to 
break the spirits of the adults 
forced them to comply to a U.S. 
nationalistic 
agenda,” 
Myles 
said. 
“It’s 
history 
repeating 
itself.”

Earlier this month, a 
team of scientists published 
a study in Nature Medi-
cine journal that could lead 
researchers closer to a uni-
versal vaccine for influenza, 
commonly known as the 
flu. Principal investigators 
include Aubree Gordon, Uni-
versity of Michigan assistant 
professor of epidemiology at 
the School of Public Health, 
and Florian Krammer, pro-
fessor of microbiology at the 
Icahn School of Medicine at 
Mount Sinai.
Krammer said the team 
found that a region of the 
flu virus is conserved from 
strain to strain that could 
provide protection for the 
human 
immune 
system. 
The conserved region is 
called the membrane proxi-
mal stalk and it’s part of the 
hemagglutinin, which has 
a head section that changes 
frequently.
When stalk antibodies 
bind to this region, the virus 
is neutralized by blocking 
fusion of viral and endosom-
al membranes, which inhib-

its development of the HA. 
There are multiple mecha-
nisms involved in the path-
way and the researchers still 
don’t know which mecha-
nism is most important for 
protection in humans.
“The head changes all the 
time. That’s why we have to 
get the flu shot every year 
because there’s so much 
variation … That the anti-
bodies that recognize this 
year’s flu shot usually don’t 
recognize 
next 
year’s,” 
Krammer said. “If you want 
a vaccine that gives protec-
tion for a long time, you can’t 
target the head, but target-
ing the stalk might be an 
option.”
The eight-month obser-
vational study relied on 
data from a cohort in Nica-
ragua. Krammer said the 
lab developed specialized 
assays, known as an inves-
tigative procedure, to con-
duct analysis of the samples 
from the cohort. One of the 
assays his lab used is called 
an enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay, which was a 
binding assay used to deter-
mine antibody titers or con-
centrations.

Krammer said the bind-
ing assay could be done 
quickly and easily standard-
ized, which could allow 
studies in the future to use 
the same assay.
In an email to The Daily, 
Fatima Amanat, a graduate 
student at ISMMS, one of 
the researchers on the proj-
ect, said the team’s research 
is important because the flu 
is easily transmitted.
“Translational 
research 
is 
extremely 
essential,” 
Amanat 
said. 
“Research 
that allows us to take what 
we learn from small ani-
mal 
models 
and 
under-
stand immune response in 
humans is very important 
nowadays.”
Krammer said his study 
could lead to a universal 
flu vaccine—a vaccine that 
could provide better and 
longer-lasting 
protection 
against multiple subtypes 
of the virus. The National 
Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases outlined 
the importance of creating a 
universal influenza vaccine 
in a paper last July. Kram-
mer added the study was 
partially funded by NIAID.

Amanat 
agrees 
with 
Krammer and said the study 
will provide an outline for 
other scientists that plan to 
test new vaccines.
“Influenza virus is a huge 
public health burden and 
despite having annual vac-
cination, influenza virus can 
cause widespread disease,” 
Amanat said. “It is great to 
now finally have a vaccine 
strategy in place that tar-
gets the stalk domain of HA 
and provides protection in 
humans.”
Krammer said another 
benefit to a universal flu vac-
cine would mean greater 
accessibility for a larger 
group of people. He said 
other diseases like measles 
and smallpox have higher 
vaccination rates than the 
flu, with it becoming uni-
versal, this might lead more 
people to consider vaccina-
tion.
“There’s people who are 
really anti-vaccination and 
I don’t think they’re easy to 
convince to get vaccinated,” 
Krammer said.

NEWS

The University of Michi-
gan Ford School of Public 
Policy was the target of phish-
ing scams this past week after 
Public Policy students, faculty 
and staff received an email 
last Tuesday from phishers 
masquerading as staff mem-
bers inquiring about their 
recipients’ 
schedule 
avail-
ability.
In an email statement 
to The Daily, Sol Bermann, 
University 
interim 
chief 
information security officer, 
explained phishing is a phe-
nomenon that affects organi-
zations worldwide.
“Phishing 
remains 
the 
most common method used 
by cyber-criminals to get 
unauthorized access to sys-
tems and data,” Bermann 
wrote. “U-M, and organi-
zations the world over, are 
constantly being plagued by 
phishing attacks. There is no 
technical way to stop them 
all. Instead, we rely on the 
University 
community 
to 
understand how to identify 
and avoid phishing at work 
and in their personal lives.”
In an interview, Ber-
mann told The Daily while 
Google’s barriers act as 
the biggest defense against 
phishing attempts, the Uni-
versity supplements such 
systems with its own tools, 
like a Chrome extension 
built by Bermann’s team and 
Information Assurance.
“We have a lot of threat 
intelligence tools that feed 
our network defenses, like 
our firewall or intrusion 
detection devices,” Bermann 

said.
Bermann also said while 
phishing 
attempts 
have 
become sophisticated over the 
years, they are not nuanced 
enough to assume phishers 
would specifically target the 
Public Policy School or even 
higher education institutions 
as a whole. Part of the rea-
son, he explained, is because 
they’re often sent by the mil-
lions.
He expressed his belief the 
recent Public Policy School 
phishing storm is part of such 
a widespread attack.
“Those seem more of a 
routine phishing attack, and 
I don’t know that it’s just 
attacking or just targeting 
Ford,” Bermann noted.
So far this year, the Univer-
sity has released 26 phishing 
alerts. One email imperson-
ated the University Library, 
while another appeared to 
be from University President 
Mark Schlissel.
As far back as 2005, stu-
dents and staff fell victim to 
phishing emails that asked 
for their TCF Bank account 
information. 
There 
have 
been several more instances 
reported over the years, such 
as fake payroll emails in 2018 
and spear phishing attacks 
that targeted University staff 
in 2013.
To 
help 
prevent 
such 
attacks, the University imple-
mented 
Duo 
Two-Factor 
Authentication 
early 
last 
year and has a section titled 
“Phishing 
and 
Suspicious 
Emails” on its Safe Comput-
ing website.

or many Americans, the U.S. 
trade war with China has 
been fought abstractly. Stock 
prices dropped, and reports have 
come out explaining how tariffs on 
Chinese imports will raise the price of 
everything from iPhones to washing 
machines. 
Within 
America, 
the 
conflict hasn’t escalated beyond tariffs 
and empty threats, despite being, in 
part, a conflict over global political 
ideologies. However, 8,100 miles 
away from Washington, the trade 
war and America’s shifting approach 
toward China have absolutely massive 
implications for the future of the 
Chinese autonomous territory of 
Hong Kong. The region has existed 
in a state of political limbo for the past 
two decades, and increasing tensions 
between China and the West could 
mean the end of Hong Kong as we 
know it.
Hong Kong, home to over 7.4 
million people, is a global business 
hub with a complicated past. After 
the first Opium War ended in 1842, 
the Qing Dynasty was forced to 
give the island of Hong Kong — at 
that point little more than a fishing 
village — to the victorious British. 
The British gradually expanded their 
control beyond the original island, 
and eventually pressured China into 
signing a 99-year lease (traditionally 
the longest possible real estate lease) 
in 1898, which gave the British full 
control over the territory. Largely 
politically autonomous and culturally 
British, the island prospered as an 
outpost of Liberal democracy.
In the 1980s, with the 99-year 
lease 
nearing 
its 
end 
and 
no 
specific plan for the future of Hong 

Kong 
in 
place, 
Chinese 
leader 
Deng 
Xiaoping 
introduced 
the 
“one country, two systems” idea. 
Under Deng’s plan, Hong Kong 
would become part of China, but 
would 
remain 
administratively 
autonomous, allowing it to operate 
its own government with a capitalist 
economic system, separate from 
communist 
China. 
Hong 
Kong 
has operated under this model of 
governance since the transfer of the 
territory from Britain to China in 
1997.
In the 22 years since Hong Kong 
became Chinese, the “one country, 
two systems” model has been largely 
effective, if not perfect. Hong Kong 
has continued to prosper financially, 
and it is ranked as the freest economy 
in the world. Simultaneously, the 
government has remained largely 
protective of citizens’ individual 
rights. After thousands of protestors 
took to the streets in 2003, Hong 
Kong legislators agreed not to pass a 
bill which would have allowed Hong 
Kongers found guilty of treason, 
sedition, secession or subversion 
against mainland China’s government 
to be sentenced to life in prison, which 
would have allowed China greater 
control over the city-state.
However, 
things 
have 
been 
changing in recent years. In 2014, 
Hong Kongers took to the streets to 
protest again after China announced 
they would vet candidates for Hong 
Kong’s 2017 elections, infringing on 
the region’s freedom. In those 2017 
elections, Carrie Lam, a pro-mainland 
candidate, 
was 
elected 
Chief 
Executive of Hong Kong despite being 
unpopular in the city. This is largely 

thanks to the backing of the mainland 
Chinese government, which controls 
many seats on the election committee.
After being elected, Lam talked 
about “The work of uniting society,” 
along with other ideas which stand 
in direct contrast to the “one country, 
two systems” ideology. Now, another 
round of protests have arisen after 
Hong Kong’s government announced 
their intent to pass a bill allowing 
certain criminals to be extradited to 
mainland China for trials. Lam, in a 
style typical of the mainland Chinese 
Communist Party, refused to even 
engage with the protestors on a 
political level, saying they were acting 
like spoiled children.
All 
of 
China’s 
recent 
encroachments on Hong Kong’s 
sovereignty, combined with a rapid 
anti-China 
shift 
among 
many 
Western powers, puts Hong Kong’s 
future in a very precarious position. 
Though China consistently prioritizes 
cultural and societal unity over both 
human rights and diversity, it used 
to make sense for China to respect 
Hong Kong’s autonomy. When China 
first reclaimed Hong Kong in 1998, it 
was not the economic superpower it 
is today. That year, China was seventh 
in the world in GDP, well behind the 
United States and a host of its allies: 
Japan, Germany, Britain, France and 
Italy.
At a time when the world was 
still unquestionably dominated by 
capitalist liberal democracies, having 
a prosperous capitalist, cosmopolitan 
outpost was a reputation booster for 
China, a country known for repressive 
communism 
and 
economically 
totalitarian five-year plans. By keeping 

Hong Kong open, China was able to 
attract global investment to the city, 
which is today home to the highest 
concentration of ultra high-net-worth 
individuals (defined as a net worth 
over $30 million) in the world. It is also 
considered an “alpha+” level world 
city, meaning it is classified as a “city 
which is a primary node in the global 
economic network” (this is the second 
highest ranking, after “alpha++”).
However, 
China’s 
geopolitical 
position today is far different than it 
was back in 1998, a change that has 
drastically altered world affairs. By 
promoting itself as a manufacturing 
hub for wealthy Western nations, 
utilizing economic protectionism and 
occasionally just outright ignoring 
global trade rules, China has rapidly 
grown and accumulated wealth. 
Today, with the second biggest gross 
domestic product in the world, an 
ambitious list of global projects such 
as the Belt and Road Initiative and 
expanding claims over regions such as 
the South China Sea, China is clearly 
a global superpower. China’s rapid 
ascension means Hong Kong, which 
once served as a valuable attraction 
for western powers, is now more of a 
liberalist thorn in the country’s side. 
Now, with the U.S. leading a Western 
charge against China over their illicit 
trading practices, China has less 
reason than ever to worry about the 
west’s perception of liberalism in 
Hong Kong.
When 
analyzing 
the 
political 
future of Hong Kong, it is important to 
consider the geographical realities of 
the situation. Though Hong Kongers 
firmly identify as being from Hong 
Kong, not China, as evidenced by their 

history of large-scale protest against 
Chinese encroachment on their rights, 
and although the city is culturally 
and economically quite Western, 
Hong Kong’s defining feature is its 
location. Ultimately, the city is still 
an island located just across the river 
from mainland China. In any dispute 
over the political future of Hong 
Kong, China, with its large army, 
deep resource pool and geographical 
position will have the upper hand 
against both the West and Hong Kong 
itself.
Taking everything into account, 
it is clear that Deng’s idea for “one 
country, two systems,” with a Hong 
Kong largely free of Chinese political 
influence, will soon be a thing of the 
past. As China continues to expand 
and flex its geopolitical strength, how 
much influence it will exert over Hong 
Kong is now the relationship’s major 
issue. China has both grown more 
powerful and become more repressive 
in recent years, but Hong Kong is still 
an economic and political bright spot, 
even if it is not as crucial as it once was. 
With that in mind, China will likely 
act cautiously when approaching 
Hong Kong, with the goal of limiting 
its autonomy without causing too 
great a global uproar. China will likely 
not touch Hong Kong’s economic 
freedoms, a major component of what 
makes the city so attractive, but will 
work to continuously chip away at the 
city’s political liberalism, suppressing 
dissent against mainland China and 
forcing residents to follow communist 
policies.

n Costa Rica, there is a relaxed 
pace in both wild life and human 
nature. It is a place to truly take in 
the untouched world around you. When 
I visit, my favorite spots to explore are 
the empty miles of coast line, water-
falls or jungle pathways. Beaches are 
stripped away of human presence and 
footprints through the circuitous 
cycle of washing waves. To experience 
Costa Rica is to understand the beauty 
and importance of a place that values 
the natural world. This reverence for 
the earth can only be accomplished 
through the attention of people and 
the prevention of immense destruc-
tion that is relatively easy for humans 
to impose upon the natural world.
I have read about the vast envi-
ronmental programs that the Costa 
Rican government wants to imple-
ment, and it is inspiring for the rest 
of the world. It plans to become a 
plastic-free and carbon-free country 
through policy work and environ-
mental determination.
There have been a few conflict-
ing prediction dates on when it will 
all come together, but they are cur-
rently working on steps to reach a 
carbon-neutral state. Costa Rica is 
already one of the leading countries 
in renewable energy. Its renewable 
energy sources provide the country 
with about 99 percent of its energy 
needs. This dedication to sustainable 
energy resources allows the country 
to uphold its conservation efforts. 
Through the environmental plan, 
Costa Rica projects that it will get to 
a point of “zero net emissions.” This 
means that its conservation efforts, 
such as reforesting and managing 
land correctly, will offset the amount 
of emissions being produced. This 
balancing act means that the country 
is limiting carbon emissions as well 
as taking a proactive role in the man-
agement of its expansive rainforests 
and beaches.
In addition to its carbon-neutral 
advancements, the nation announced 
its plans to become completely plastic 
free by 2021. This would make it the 
first country to complete such a task. 
The country as a whole is working to 
replace plastics with biodegradable 
or sustainable alternatives in order 
to reduce the harmful impact of plas-
tics in landfills and oceans. While 
visiting Costa Rica, I saw this reduc-
tion of plastic across several fields. I 
noticed national advertisements for 
alternatives, as well as local efforts 
to reduce waste. Handmade post-
ers decorated the walls of cafés that 
promoted a plastic free environment. 
Coffee shops only provided composta-
ble materials and cardboard straws. 

Family-run souvenir shops skipped 
plastic bags and posted up phrases like 
“Do you really need a bag? Say NO to 
plastic bags.” It was a hopeful sight to 
see that the Costa Rican people really 
supported the country’s push for 
environmental change. This under-
scores that community level passion 
is instrumental in fueling the drive 
for governmental and nation-wide 
policy. 
Some skeptics have explained that 
these ambitious plans will be too dif-
ficult to achieve by 2021. In an article 
from Vox, Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, 
the country’s minister of environ-
ment and energy, explained that 
“some people have misunderstood 
the President’s declarations because 
we don’t plan to ban the use of fos-
sil fuels, we plan to phase them out 
through new policies and incentives 
so that eventually, down the road, 
they will be useless.” It is clear that 
this will not be a one-step process 
of simply banning everything that 
stands in the way of environmental 
purity.
Most of the country’s emissions 
come from the transportation sector, 
which is reportedly one of the hard-
est areas to decarbonize quickly. 
The high demand for transportation 
and private ownership could be due 
to the expansive lands and distance 
between cities. In addition to the 
large territory, I noticed that most 
roads wind through jungles and 
mountains, which seemingly makes 
it even more difficult and slow to 
travel by car. These long distances 
ultimately create a higher need for 
gas and thus higher rates of emis-
sions. The government’s fix for this 
is to incentivize cleaner options such 
as electric cars in order to reduce the 
carbon footprint in the transporta-
tion front. 
From international news to local 
observations, it is clear that this 
Central American country is trying 
to raise awareness and care for the 
beautiful environment it calls home. 
Though some of the government’s 
claims are difficult to achieve with-
out some large overhauls of emissions 
and product usage, the mere fact that 
it is instigating these changes is quite 
revolutionary. Costa Rica is looking 
to be the first country to achieve its 
goals and set policies and passion for 
the betterment of its people’s future. 
I only hope that the rest of the world 
looks to its intelligence and vigor in 
its strive for a sustainable nation and 
seeks to follow suit.

Costa Rican environmental policy is pura vida

T

he Met, MoMA, the 
DIA, even our very own 
UMMA: 
There’s 
one 
thing these so-called “high art” 
institutions have in common 
— the art is usually displayed 
on white walls. This is done 
intentionally to avoid distraction, 
to create a void-like space in 
which you can experience the art 
while expelling your prior biases, 
so you may receive each piece of 
art with a more open mind. Those 
in charge of the walls can’t seem 
to be influenced by their own 
design, however, as the problem 
with these white walls is that 
most of the art that adorns them 
is, in fact, white — and male. 
And there, again, we see the 
same story played on repeat, 
even in a world that supposedly 
prides itself on progressive open-
mindedness and being ahead of 
the curve.
A recent study done by a 
group of professors looked at 
18 major American art institu-
tions — including the Met, the 
Art Institute of Chicago and the 
DIA — and found 85 percent of 
the artists represented at these 
institutions were white. 87 per-
cent were male. Compared to the 
U.S. Census data — which shows 
only 60.7 percent of the Ameri-
can population self-identify as 
“white alone, not Hispanic or 
Latino” and 49.2 percent identify 
as male — those raw numbers 
are appalling. This same study 
found 60 percent of museum 
staff are women, though they 
only compose 43 percent of those 
in leadership or directorial roles. 
72 percent of museum staff are 
white.
The argument to this is that 
many of these museums include, 
and in some cases, prioritize his-
torical collections, and American 
museums are inclined toward 
procuring European historical 
art, which was generally made by 
white, male artists. And this was 
a time when women and people of 
color were marginalized from the 
art community. Let’s set aside the 

idea that prioritizing said Euro-
pean art encourages a limited 
view of history that legitimizes 
outdated Western ideals of race 
and gender power dynamics. 
Let’s instead take a look at the 
galleries that feature work from 
contemporary artists — post-
enlightenment era work that one 
would expect to be more open 
and representative — and we find 
that it isn’t. A study looking at 
the top 45 galleries in New York 
City found 78.4 percent of the 
artists represented by these gal-
leries were white, 85.4 percent of 
the American artists were white 
and 70 percent of all artists were 
male. This is a problem that per-
sists.

The confusing bit is that most 
art schools are, in fact, more 
diverse and female-dominated 
than this. Of the 125 students 
studying at the Yale School of 
Art, 70 are women — that’s 56 
percent. Our own School of Art 
and Design claims the “majority 
of our undergraduate students 
self-identify as women, a trend 
observed nationally and glob-
ally in schools of art & design.” 
Stamps also reported that 27.7 
percent of its students identi-
fied as part of a minority group, 
which, while still notably white, 
is not over 80 percent white, and 
is continuing to trend up.
Both the study on U.S. Muse-
ums and NYC galleries were 
done 
through 
crowdsourcing 
— taking starting points of data, 
such as gallery rosters or exhibi-
tion artist lists, and asking mem-

bers of the community to fill out 
the demographic information 
to the best of their knowledge. 
Now, this may seem like an 
unreliable method for procur-
ing data, but that is not a reason 
to dismiss these studies. First, 
the numbers of both studies have 
been updated upon both of their 
releases, after having been scru-
tinized by the public and cor-
rected for errors. Second, this 
represents at least a glimmer of 
data in an arena in which little to 
no demographic data is available. 
You can’t fix a problem you don’t 
know exists.
So how do we fix this? It starts 
at the top. Gallery owners and 
exhibition 
curators 
need 
to 
make a point of procuring work 
from people of color and women. 
While many art students are a 
part of these minority groups, 
they — rightfully so — may not 
feel they are able to “make it” in 
the gallery art world and there-
fore decide to pursue differ-
ent avenues with their degrees. 
Buying art from more margin-
alized communities emboldens 
those, with or without a degree, 
to realize their art can be on 
those white walls too. Art needs 
to be prioritized as a part of 
early education, which is, sadly, 
negatively trending with more 
and more art programs being 
cut in underprivileged commu-
nities — areas that are generally 
the most diverse.
Galleries and museums are 
slowly beginning to shake this 
antiquated representation, but 
it’s not happening anywhere 
near quickly enough. White 
walls are starting to feel con-
stricting, archaic, monotonous. 
So, hell, let’s paint the walls 
black, brown, pink or whatever 
color you’d like. It’s not quite the 
subtlety you think of in “high 
art,” but I’m over subtle. Those 
white walls could use a splash of 
color.

Hippo Campus opened Bonna-
roo’s Saturday evening sets with 
an energetic performance that 
prevailed over the scorching heat. 
The Minnesota band played hits 
from both of their last two albums 
— Landmark which dropped in 
the winter of 2017 and Bambi that 
followed a year later — the sixty-
minute set showing their range as 
a collective, while giving a taste of 
their development from one project 
to the next. After the show, all five 
members of the band (lead guitarist 
Jake Luppen, lead guitarist Nathan 
Stocker, bassist Zach Sutton, drum-
mer Whistler Allen, trumpeter 
DeCarlo Jackson) sat down with 
The Daily to talk about the evolu-
tion of their sound, their first musi-
cal influences and their band’s code 
of conduct in the event of mass hys-
teria.
The Michigan Daily: How does 
playing at a massive festival like 
Bonnaroo compare to a smaller, 
more intimate show?
Zach 
Sutton: 
I 
think 
you 
answered your own question. It’s 
definitely less intimate at a festival. 
At a show, especially at a smaller 

show with a smaller venue, smaller 
attendance, you have the opportu-
nity to be more subtle, more inti-
mate, more … quiet, even, whereas 
at festivals you kind of have to keep 
the ball rolling, keep the energy up. 
I can’t say I prefer one or the other, 
they’re both different. They’re both 
super fun.
Nathan Stocker: One’s a buffet 
and one’s the main course.
TMD: ‘Bambi’ felt like a big 
change from ‘Landmark,’ both 
in terms of the electronic instru-
mentation and the confessional 
themes. Would you say those 
changes are connected?
ZS: Definitely.
NS: Yes. Jake (Luppen)? What do 
you have to say about that?
Jake Luppen: …
ZS: Process, process …
JL: Mmm, I don’t know, what do 
you guys think?
ZS: Well I personally feel like 
there’s a correlation. We spent 
a lot of time separate from each 
other, writing Bambi with our 
computers, outside of the room 
jamming together. And that hap-
pened because of natural changes 
— whether that’s with our producer 
or just learning more about produc-
tion — and then that was reflected 
in the lyrics and in the content 
because we drifted more outside of 
the ‘Basement,’ as we call it.
JL: I think the electronic ele-
ments helped us strip things down 
because everything was so clean. 

It allowed us to strip all the songs 
down to a minimal amount of 
instruments while still allowing 
them to be as loud and aggressive as 
we wanted them to be.
TMD: Do you see that as a 
future direction for Hippo Cam-
pus?
JL: I don’t know, I feel like we’ll 
probably make a record that sounds 
totally different from Bambi next … 
cause we’re in the business of mak-
ing records that sound different.
ZS: That’s right.
JL: Every time.
DeCarlo Jackson: (Mumbling a 
melody) Burr-pa-burr ...
JL: Yeah, something like that.
TMD: Speaking of future proj-
ects, Jake, you recently posted 
on twitter about a future demos 
album. You just released ‘Demos 
1’ a few days ago. What will that 
(future album) be? Will that just 
be ‘Demos 2’?
JL: Well, you know, what natu-
rally follows one is typically two.
(The band laughs)
NS: What normally follows one? 
When I say I have to go to the bath-
room, and they ask which number, I 
say number one.
JL: It’s not demos three.
NS: And when I say I have to go 
to the bathroom a few hours later, 
they don’t ask, they know. He’s 
going number two.
TMD: What track would you 
say you’re the most proud of?
ZS: In our discography?

TMD: Yeah.
ZS: I like “Warmglow” the best. 
It’s different from the rest, and I 
fuck with it. 
NS: I can back that. I like differ-
ent songs for different reasons, you 
can’t really pick one. But that’s sort 
of the point, to reach closer and 
closer to all of them completing a 
puzzle, but it’s never really ending, 
that search for the right pieces.
TMD: Okay, so, you all are 
stranded on a deserted island. 
Something’s 
gone 
terribly 
wrong, it’s just the five of you. 
Who is the first to resort to can-
nibalism and eat the others? 
That or some other depraved 
nonsense.
JL: Zach (Sutton).
ZS: You think I’m gonna —
NS: You’re gonna eat one of us 
first. Yeah.
JL: Zach’s the most violent one.
DJ: Or at least suggest it (canni-
balism), like.
NS: Yeah, you’re like, “Guys, just 
thinking, we’re all hungry.”
ZS: Guys, I would never do that.
NS: It’s not about you never doing 
it, it’s about you being the first one —
ZS: Genuinely, I think it would be 
you, Nathan. You’d be like, “We’ve 
gotta look at the facts.”
NS: The first one to be eaten 
would 
definitely 
be 
Whistler 
(Allen).
Whistler Allen, silent until now, 
smiles.
Whistler Allen: That’s not the 
question.
ZS: Unfortunately, I agree with 
you (Nathan). 
(The band laughs)
NS: Whistler would be eaten 
first. We wouldn’t be able to find 
DeCarlo (Jackson) ‘cause he’d be 
playing trumpet somewhere. 
ZS: ‘Cause he’d have his trumpet, 
undoubtedly.
NS Jake would leave a bread-
crumb trail of shit he brought with 
you.
DJ: Just a whole stack of hotel 
cards.
NS: Zach would be working out 
or something. And I’d be doing 
what I’m doing right now, analyz-
ing all of it … Yeah you know, maybe 
I would do it.
TMD: So what was the transi-
tion like, adding a fifth member 
(Jackson)?
ZS: Seamless.
NS: Yeah, there wasn’t really 
much of one.
JL: (to Jackson) How’d you feel?
DJ: How’d I feel? Man, I felt a 
whole lot of things. It was really 
hard.
JL: Really?
DJ: I mean, it’s a tough group to 

play with, because you can’t over-
play, but if you underplay everyone 
will assume you don’t exist. It was 
a tough in-between to find. At the 
same time, I tried to make the tran-
sition as easy as possible on every-
one else. In the sense that I tried to 
only make things better — I tried 
my best not to get in the way too 
much.
TMD: How did you get started 
with the group? How did you 
integrate or meet?
DJ: Umm, we all went to high 
school, so I’ve known these guys 
since they sucked at writing music.
NS: For the record, we still suck 
at writing music.
DJ: You didn’t let me finish my 
sentence, either.
TMD: Do you guys have any 
artists that you remember latch-
ing onto growing up? Kind of as 
your first influence? Your first 
favorite artist?
NS: Enya.
ZS: Was that? Because that was 
big for me.
NS: Enya was big.
ZS: The first record I bought 
was Black Parade by My Chemical 
Romance.
DJ: Ah.
ZS: And I stand by that as being 
a big influence on everything I do — 
extending past music.
DJ: Fallout Boy Infinity On High. 
Pfff, crazy.
JL: Led Zeppelin had this live 
album called How the West Was 
Won, and I used to listen to that all 
the time.
TMD: Who are your guys’ 
favorite active artists?
ZS: The Brother Brothers. I 
cannot get enough of The Brother 
Brothers.
NS: The Brother Brothers are 
really good.
TMD: I’m not familiar with 
them, what are they like?
ZS: Folk.
NS: Twins.
ZS: They are brothers, come to 
find out. They covered Buck Meek’s 
song on their I think first and only 
record —
NS: No, it’s their second record.
ZS: Second record? Some People I 
Know, something like that … (sing-
ing) “Sam Bridges burned down 
to El Paso / Chasing the sound of 
speed.”
NS: Anyway, anyone else? 
DJ: Oh and Nilüfer Yanya, Nilüfer 
Yanya. Is that how you say it?
NS: (singing) “Mahhhliah, mahhl-
iah.” Great. Great record.
ZS: And Fontaines D.C.
JL: Recently Club Night put out 
a really cool album, about a month 
ago, I think.

As the old saying goes, the most 
qualified person is not always the 
best for the job. We’ve heard this for 
much of our lives, whether it be in ref-
erence to getting an internship, a job, 
a seat in a graduate program or, hell, 
even a significant other. Someone can 
have every accolade to their name, but 
that doesn’t mean they’ll be the right 
fit. Sometimes, it takes more than 
just a shining résumé; some people 
just have the “it” factor. It might be 
their demeanor, attitude or specific 
skill set, but when someone has the 
“it” factor, it’s obvious. In the case of 
D.C. rapper GoldLink, he has a knack 
for finding the “it” factor, especially 
when it comes from a singer or rapper 
that still has a lot to prove.
For much of GoldLink’s career, he 
has taken growing talent that has yet 
to see the spotlight and made amaz-
ing music with them. Take his 2017 
sleeper hit “Crew” for example. He 
collaborated with Shy Glizzy, a rap-
per perpetually trapped at the brink 
of breakout success, and Brent Faiyaz, 
a silky-voiced newcomer still try-
ing to get his feet off the ground, and 
together, they struck gold. Each man 
brought their own unique panache to 
the track, and this is credited to each 
respective artist’s hunger and desire 
to breakout. Now that GoldLink has 
risen to a higher profile, it would make 
sense for him to start seeking out big-
ger feature artists. Diaspora does see 
bigger names hitting the tracklist, 
however, Goldlink continues to put on 
lesser-known talent.
Diaspora is an incredible collection 

of songs steamed in GoldLink’s sound. 
No one else sounds like him, and he 
knows it. He leans into his nasally 
voice and bouncy, seamless flow and 
finds collaborators who will aug-
ment his sound without altering it. On 
“Zulu Screams,” Diaspora’s energetic 
lead single, GoldLink takes his dance-
able and electronics components and 
fuses it with Maleek Berry’s afrobeats 
touch. Berry, a world star who has yet 
to break through to the U.S. main-
stream, proves to be a perfect fit on 
the song. His joyous voice and exu-
berant production perfectly accent 
GoldLink’s dance-influenced sound. 

Berry puts his own unique touch on 
the song, proving GoldLink’s ability to 
get the best out of collaborators.
GoldLink further demonstrates 
this ability with outstanding songs 
like “Joke Ting” and “Rumble.” On 
“Joke Ting,” guest feature Ari Pen-
Smith delivers an excellent hook 
that matches and blends in with the 
laid-back vibe of GoldLink’s delivery. 
What’s more, she even matches the 
tone of his braggadocious and slick-
talking verse. PenSmith flexes a little 
bit with lines like, “‘Cause my whole 
squad on swole, you don’t wanna get 
involved / Get close, you might choke, 
we ain’t on a joke ting,” which perfect-
ly drives GoldLink’s verse home. Fur-
ther, on “Rumble,” GoldLink brings 

on DMV rapper Lil Nei as well as 
Jackson Wang, solo artist and mem-
ber of Korean boy band GOT7, both 
of whom bring lighthearted perfor-
mances to an already boisterous and 
jovial track.
Despite the prominence of new-
comers on Diaspora, GoldLink also 
performs without assistance. Tracks 
like the reminiscent and chill “Tiff 
Freestyle” and the frantic, dextrous 
“Manic” both show that GoldLink 
is more than capable of carrying a 
song by himself. Surprisingly, how-
ever, GoldLink does also bring in a 
few high-profile artists to collaborate 
with him. Pusha T, Khalid and Tyler, 
the Creator all make appearances, 
but they aren’t just there to boost 
streaming numbers. They were all 
clearly chosen because GoldLink felt 
that they were the most fit artist for 
their respective songs and that no one 
else could do it better than them. And 
it’s true. Each artist has a great and 
personality-filled performance, with 
Khalid taking home the title of best 
feature. Replace these artists and the 
tracks wouldn’t have had the same 
synergy and dynamicism.
With Diaspora, GoldLink tightens 
the screws from his last release, At 
What Cost. He crafts more enjoyable 
songs, varies his flows and has better 
beat selection. No song reaches the 
heights of “Crew,” but he comes close 
with both “Zulu Screams” and “U 
Say.” What’s more, GoldLink proves 
that his ability to find the perfect 
artists to fit his songs is unmatched. 
No feature is wasted, and no feature 
is unwanted. Everyone involved in 
the project delivers, but especially 
the mastermind behind the project 
himself, crafting an album that is 
distinctly GoldLink.

ALBUM REVIEW

 NPR

Let’s start this gig off by stat-
ing the obvious: The meaning of 
Pride Month has changed, or at 
least expanded, drastically.
This short bit of gay dribble is 
not a sound-off about how Adidas 
shouldn’t be releasing a collec-
tion of rainbow colored sneak-
ers that may or may not stand to 
benefit the community it seeks 
to represent in any way what-
soever. There are reasons why 
they should, there are reasons 
why they shouldn’t, there are 
things they could do to make it 
feel less exploit-
ative and they’re 
going to release 
them anyway. Its 
existence 
serves 
better as a barom-
eter of Pride and 
its 
relationship 
to mass commer-
cialization 
than 
a lightning rod 
for social critique 
because, 
to 
be 
honest, there are 
too many of those 
to keep track. 
There is press 
circulating the dauntingly fast-
paced, streetwear and sneaker-
focused section of the internet 
detailing their choice to support 
LGBTQ+ athletes (the other being 
to quietly cut ties for a made-up 
reason and hope nobody notic-
es). Articles covering it describe 
the move as an obvious one, but 
in effect congratulate them for 
doing so. We as consumers are 
unlikely to see, let alone pay any 
real attention to, the seemingly 
obligatory and phoned-in state-
ments given by mega-corpora-
tions during the month of June. 
Yet, they manage to commu-
nicate something beyond their 
own sentiments performed in the 
name of self-interest — they rep-
resent the ill-matched marriage 
between 
social 
progressivism 
and our current market.
It’s fascinating and soul-goug-
ing to observe how companies 
posture themselves, intention-

ally or not, as morally-upright 
champions of discredited identi-
ties and communities. It’s also 
very easy to look in the rearview 
mirror, think about icons of queer 
liberation like Crystal LaBeija or 
Martha P. Johnson, and wonder 
if all their strife amounted to 
highly profitable identity badges 
and not much else.
There are a lot of articles 
detailing exactly how rainbow 
capitalism works, how it spits on 
what the first pride parades set 
out to do. Detailing how vitally 
important it is to support queer 
creators, companies that actu-
ally 
support 
the 
community 
through and through and to be 
able to discern them from hol-
low attempts at a 
cash grab via color 
gradient. If you’re 
reading this one, 
odds 
are 
you’re 
already aware of 
this concern (and 
if not, feel free 
to click on some 
highlighted words 
and get yourself 
up to speed). The 
truth is that there 
is very little to say 
that hasn’t already 
been said in this 
way, 
and 
Pride 
Month continues to be treated 
as an injection of capital during 
a time of the year when sales are 
normally down.
Markets prey on the margin-
alized, and it’s bigger than pride 
packs or tank tops that say Make 
America Gay Again on them. It’s 
bigger than the consumer that 
buys those products (really, buy 
the shoes if you like them, you’re 
not going to be sentenced to 
eternal damnation over a pair of 
Continental 80s). It’s bigger than 
the companies that provide those 
products, too — even the ones 
coming from the most genuine 
place and providing the greatest 
amount of support are operat-
ing in an unethical market that 
rewards all entities that adhere 
to a fashionable, adulterated and 
constantly shifting morality.

ANNOUNCEMENT

“Rounders” is far and away the 
most stressful movie I have ever 
seen. The tightly wound caper of law 
student and aspiring poker pro Mike 
McDermott, played by a young and 
devilish Matt Damon (“Downsiz-

ing”), is as compelling as it is excruci-
ating. There is a case to be made that 
the film’s ceaseless momentum and 
satisfying payoffs are the result of 
quirky characters and strong story-
telling. However, there is a potentially 
more worthwhile reason “Rounders” 
still holds up so well: its understand-
ing of the actual mechanics of poker.
For this final installment of my 
series on poker hands in movies, I’ll 

take a look at how “Rounders” takes 
advantage of the logic of poker to 
sharpen its story and characters. 
While the previous films I discussed, 
“Maverick” and “Casino Royale,” 
missed the mark in their poker games, 
“Rounders” is far more reliable. It’s a 
poker movie that refuses to hold a 
viewer’s hand, clearly constructed 
by screenwriters (David Levien and 
Brian Koppelman, “Billions”) who 

understand the card game and its 
enigmatic draw. It would be one thing 
for “Rounders” to simply employ rea-
sonable card game behavior. But the 
reason I find it so entertaining on 
repeat viewings is that it actually uses 
poker to shape its narrative.
First, let’s take a look at the film’s 
first big hand and one of its most 
upsetting moments. On a confident 
streak, Mike ventures to The Ches-
terfield, a seedy, noirish hideout 
run by Russian mobster Teddy KGB 
(John Malkovich, “Velvet Buzzsaw”). 
In what starts out as a modest pot, 
Mike hits a full house, nines full of 
aces. After he and Teddy eventually 
shove, the latter flips his higher full 
house, aces full of nines. Not only 
is this a realistic hand I have been 
ruined by and which has ruined plen-
ty of others in poker, but it’s one that 
allows Mike’s judgment to feel rea-
sonable and foolish at the same time. 
He was there along with us the whole 
time, explaining his methodology in 
reading Teddy, squeezing maximum 
money out of him. As a result of this 
believable set-up, the expression 
Damon wears upon 
the realization of his 
defeat (and loss of 
$30,000) is utterly 
heart-sinking.
The movie’s first 
game serves more 
than one purpose. It 
does a decent job of 
convincing a viewer 
of Mike’s gambling 
chops while also tak-
ing a large swing at his confidence 
as a player. Everything after this bad 
beat is the painfully tense process of 
Mike being lured back into the game, 
building back up that confidence and 
putting it to the test. 
One of the film’s less believable 
but thoroughly entertaining scenes is 
the infamous judges’ game, which is 
something of an institution at Mike’s 
law school. When Mike drops off a 
few papers for a professor, he can’t 
help but insert himself into the game. 
It’s not totally clear what game the 
judges are playing, though it seems 
to involve community cards, multiple 
rounds of betting and a low limit. 
After only a few moments, Mike is 
able to read every judge’s hand and 
wagers for a summer clerkship with 
Judge Marinachi. “Well, you were 
looking for that third three, but you 
forgot that Professor Green folded 
it on fourth street and now you’re 
representing that you have it. The 
DA made his two pair but he knows 
they’re no good. Judge Kaplan was 
trying to squeeze out a diamond flush 
but he came up short, and Mr. Eisen 
is futilely hoping that his queens are 

going to stand up. So like I said, the 
Dean’s bet is $20,” he says with admi-
rable confidence. 
On all accounts, this moment 
makes no sense. It’s impossible, even 
for a seasoned poker professional, to 
simply glance at a group of strang-
ers and read their hands back to 
them. And yet, every time I rewatch 
it, I don’t care. The calm boldness 
of Damon’s line-reading is so capti-
vating that it covers up the general 
ridiculousness of the situation. The 
scene certainly breaks the laws of 
reality that govern the rest of the film. 
It’s a cheat, and I’m OK with it, sim-
ply because it’s so rare for this movie 
to cut corners. When it actually hap-
pens, it’s so smoothly rendered that I 
can suspend my disbelief. 
While I can look past the improb-
ability of the judges’ game read, the 
biggest flaw of “Rounders” is the 
tell of its villain, KGB. The hustling 
mobster should by all means have 
every part of his body language under 
control. Still, he can’t refrain from 
munching on a tray of Oreos that 
invariably sits next to his chip stack. 
From the very begin-
ning of the movie, we 
see him take apart 
the Oreos, cookie 
from 
creme, 
and 
either eat them or 
discard them. And 
when Mike finally 
realizes 
this 
was 
Teddy’s tell all along 
during 
the 
final 
game, we can’t help 
but wonder why he — or anyone else 
— never noticed. After admitting he 
knows Teddy’s tell, he rips apart the 
mobster’s aggression in a run that is 
so satisfying it makes up for the stress 
of everything before.
The reason that this obvious tell 
stands out so unavoidably in “Round-
ers” is that the movie is otherwise 
subtle with its gameplay. Like I said, 
“Rounders” takes no time to explain 
the complexities of Texas Hold’em. 
So when it drops on the audience a 
piece of information as glaring as 
Teddy’s Oreo tell, we can’t help but 
feel like it was unearned. 
While I can’t vouch for every poker 
movie I’ve mentioned on this series, 
I say without a doubt that “Round-
ers” is my favorite poker movie. As 
a nostalgic capsule of the ’90s and 
a story that plays by realistic poker 
outcomes, I return to it frequently 
to learn something new each time. 
“Rounders” above all demonstrates 
that for poker to succeed in storytell-
ing, it must at a minimum abide by 
the way the game is really played, and 
at best, use the emotional swings to 
develop character.

Going all-in on ‘Rounders’

My name: the color of gold

 ; the color of gold. In Bengali, my 
mother tongue, pronounced: shoo-born-
ah. The name given to me by my parents, 
recent immigrants to the Western Hemi-
sphere, lovingly gazing down at their first-
born child in this new world.
The color of gold. My memories of the 
first three years of my life are backlit in a 
warm light, created by the love of being 
brought up in a household of doting par-
ents, grandparents and aunts. I was the 
center of my little world, seeing everything 
with innocence and curiosity.
The color of gold. 
Pretty soon, I started 
pre-school, where I 
began to learn English, 
surrounded by my Eng-
lish-speaking 
teach-
ers and classmates for 
hours at a time. There, 
everyone 
called 
me 
by the actual spelling 
of my name, Subarna 
(pronounced: 
sooh-
barn-ah). As a toddler, 
I obviously didn’t have 
the mental capacity to 
think anything about 
this difference; it was 
just an addition to my 
life, something that I 
went along with. Even 
though I spent a good 
deal of my day in pre-
school, I never truly 
had fun until I came 
home and played in 
my backyard with my 
grandfather watching 
me in the warmth of 
the afternoon, sunlight 
peeking through the 
leaves of his extensive 
garden.
And so my life went 
on, with me going 
through my primary 
education, and even-
tually middle school 
and high school, all the while being known 
as Shuborna (or my nickname, Mumu) 
at home and Soobarna to the rest of the 
world. This was never something I ques-
tioned, even when I was old enough to real-
ize that the English pronunciation did not 
align with the way my language intended it 
to. In fact, at one point I saw this as some-
thing to be happy about; I essentially had 
two identities, something to clearly distin-
guish my two lives of home and school. I 
didn’t let one part of my life into the other, 
and my name made sure of that.
Sometime during the later stages of 
high school, I remember telling some of 

my Indian friends that the name they had 
been calling me by for all these years, the 
name that led to silly nicknames like “subs” 
and “subie”, wasn’t the way my name was 
meant to be. When I told them the actual 
pronunciation of my name, they, for lack 
of a better term, freaked the heck out. 
Among many comments, one reaction that 
remains in my mind is one of them saying 
in an exasperated tone, “Shuborna? That 
sounds SO weird.”
The comment left me feeling a bit 
uncomfortable, but I didn’t really dissect 
the interaction until later. Now, almost two 
years later, here is my response.
No one else in this world besides my par-
ents and I, besides the ancient language of 
Bangla itself, can deter-
mine what is and is not 
an acceptable way to 
pronounce my name. My 
name belongs entirely 
to myself and my long 
line of ancestors who 
have preserved the Ben-
gali culture through-
out centuries of good 
times and bad, through 
war 
and 
oppression 
and colonialism, and 
my name, , the 
color of gold, reflects all 
of these struggles; the 
struggles of my seven-
year-old father fleeing 
his village in the midst 
of war, the struggles of 
my mother as a newly 
married bride in Cana-
da, separated by oceans 
and 
continents 
from 
her Mother India, the 
struggles of my fam-
ily as they raised my 
brother and I in a world 
they had grown up only 
reading about and see-
ing on television. My 
name, , the color 
of gold, is a testament 
to the strength of my 
family as every single 
moment in every single 
one of my ancestors’ 
lives has led to me being where I am today.
Today, in a place where the truth of my 
name, its authenticity, the way it was plant-
ed on this earth, is reduced to “Shuborna? 
That sounds SO weird”. A world where my 
name, , the color of gold, has its light 
dimmed by someone else’s own perception 
of the world.
Since that experience, I’ve always been 
wondering if there will ever be a time 
when I can let my two lives eventually 
merge into one. Now, after my first year 
of college, I feel like that day is coming 
closer and closer. Throughout the past 
few months, I’ve found myself opening 

PHOTO COURTESY OF ANURIMA KUMAR

up to the people around me more than 
I ever did in high school, and I’ve been 
struggling less and less with what people 
think of me or how I look as I walk down 
the street; as cliche as it sounds, college 
has liberated my mind and my spirit, 
bringing me closer, day by day, to accept-
ing myself. But the question that still 
remains is, who actually is this “myself”, 
this soul that is finally being unearthed 
after digging through so may layers? Is 
she Soobarna, the name I hear most often 
throughout my day, or is she Shuborna, 
the name I’m known by only in a small 
fraction of my world? As I go on with my 
life, as I make my mark on this world, 
how do I want to be remembered?
I’d like to think that I want to be 
remembered as the name that connects 
me most directly to my roots, the name 
that calls to mind the most captivating 
ray of sunshine hitting the earth. In an 
ideal world, I would have everyone call 
me by my true pronunciation, Shubor-
na. But my logical side is constantly 
nagging, pointing out all of the people 
who, for almost nineteen years, have 
called me by Soobarna; people who I 

call my best friends, who I know will 
continue to be in my life for years to 
come. Is it fair to ask them to switch all 
of a sudden?
While I was in the process of writ-
ing this piece, quite a few of my friends 
on campus asked if they should call 
me by the true pronunciation of my 
name; at first, I leaned towards letting 
them make the decision, saying some-
thing like, “only if you’re comfortable 
switching”. But I realized that this goes 
against everything that has been both-
ering me; the whole point is to empower 
myself, to give myself control over the 
way I present myself to the world. By 
letting others choose the pronunciation 
of my own name, I am continuing to 
relinquish the power that I had already 
been giving up for years, the power of 
defining my position in this world.
All it takes is a simple correction: 
“actually, my name is pronounced this 
way.” It’s not that hard to do. Though 
I still feel strange doing it, I know that 
once that change has become universal, 
the world will finally know me in my 
purest, most golden form.

Trio of Wolverines projected as potential second-round picks

On June 20, Jordan Poole, 
Ignas Brazdeikis and Charles 
Matthews will have a new home 
— that is, assuming all three are 
drafted on draft night. With none 
of them expected to come off the 
draft board in the first round, 
the former Wolverines figure to 
be available in the second round 
and even after the draft.
“In the second round, you’re 
not 
drafting 
stars, 
you’re 
drafting guys you expect to make 
your team,” said ESPN analyst 
Jay Bilas on a conference call. 
“You would like to be rotation 
players, perhaps one day starters. 
But it’s pretty rare that you get 
to middle of the second round 
finding a star-caliber player. It’s 
not unheard of, but it’s pretty 
darn rare.”
Bilas had high praise for Poole 
and Brazdeikis and believes that 
both have shown enough to get 
drafted in the second half of 
the night. Though Poole seemed 
to show more promise with his 
shooting and ability to pass, Bilas 
admired Brazdeikis’ aggressive 
mindset. But regardless of each 
player’s pros, Bilas indicated 
that both are still raw talents 
that have a long way to go before 
becoming a staple in the NBA.
“Jordan 
Poole 
would 
be 

probably the best prospect of 
the three (Michigan players), 
I would say,” Bilas said. “He’s 
a good creator, I think a good 
passer. Did a good job of seeing 
open people off of ball screens. 
I think he could be a secondary 
ball handler in the NBA and 
facilitate at times. But a good, 
solid shooter. Shot just under 
40% from three, makes over 80% 
of his free throws.
“I think Ignas Brazdeikis has 
a good shot of getting drafted. 
I’ve got him ranked right in the 
second 
round. 
Another 
guy 
that’s got talent, 
tough-minded. 
I think he has 
ability 
to 
play 
in the NBA. He 
can score, he can 
use either hand. 
He shot a pretty 
decent percentage 
from three.
I 
think 
he’s 
going to continue 
to get better. One of the things I 
liked about him a lot is he attacks 
closeouts, doesn’t shy away from 
anything.”
The oldest, and perhaps most 
NBA-ready, is Charles Matthews. 
In pre-draft workouts, he proved 
himself to be one of the best 
defensive prospects in the draft 
after anchoring Michigan on 

that end of the floor for the last 
two years.
But on June 8, his journey took 
a turn for the worst when he tore 
his ACL in a pre-draft workout 
with the Boston Celtics. As a 
result, Matthews may have to 
play his way onto a professional 
league roster once he’s completed 
his recovery, though Bilas hopes 
teams will recognize his motor 
and defensive potential on draft 
night.
However, with poor shooting 
performances 
during 
the 
NBA 
Combine 
backed 
by 
subpar 
shooting 
percentages 
as 
a 
Wolverine, 
Matthews’ 
draft 
stock is very much 
up in the air.
“I was really 
sad 
to 
see 
that 
Charles 
Matthews 
got 
injured 
because 
I think he would 
have been drafted,” Bilas said. 
“It will be interesting to see 
whether 
that 
injury 
affects 
that. He’s well-built for an 
NBA player, so he’s got size, a 
wingspan of 6-foot-9, 6-foot-10. 
Can guard multiple positions. I 
always saw him as being a solid 
defender, he can switch. He’s got 
a good motor, plays really hard.”

With former Michigan coach 
John Beilein with the Cleveland 
Cavaliers, it’s safe to assume that 
each Wolverine will get looks 
from their college mentor — 
Brazdeikis even had a pre-draft 

workout with Beilein and the 
Cavaliers on Monday.
And 
though 
nothing 
is 
guaranteed, expect at least one 
of the Michigan trio to have his 
name called towards the end of

Howard to earn $11.2 million, assistant coaching pool raised

Michigan is paying its head 
coach less, and its assistants 
more. Thus is the trade-off when 
you lose John Beilein and hire 
assistants who have held head 
college jobs and sat on NBA 
benches.
Juwan 
Howard, 
introduced 
last month as the Wolverines’ 
new basketball coach, will make 
$11.2 million over a five-year 
deal, per his memorandum of 
understanding. The deal was 
obtained by The Daily via a 
Freedom 
of 
Information 
Act 
request.
Annually, 
Howard’s 
deal 
starts at $2 million, going up 
by $100,000 in each of the five 
years. Unlike Beilein’s contract, it 

features buyouts for both parties. 
Should Howard be fired without 
cause in his first year, it will cost 
the Michigan athletic department 
$5 million. That number drops by 
$1 million in each year of his deal.
On the other side, if Howard 
leaves 
the 
Wolverines 
“for 
other 
basketball 
related 
employment,” he will owe the 
athletic department half of the 
University’s buyout for that year. 
The lack of a similar clause in the 
deal Beilein signed last summer 
allowed him to leave Michigan for 
the Cleveland Cavaliers without 
any financial consequence. If 
Howard, who has interviewed for 
multiple NBA head coaching jobs, 
including this offseason, does the 
same thing, it will cost him.
Though 
Howard’s 
annual 
salary is significantly less than the 

$3.8 million Beilein was earning, 
Michigan upped its assistant 
coaching pool by $275,000.
Saddi Washington, the only 
assistant coach retained from 
Beilein’s staff, saw his annual 
salary raised from $305,000 to 
$330,000. As for the new guys,

Christan Bullock showing he belongs in the starting lineup

OMAHA, Neb. – The Michigan 
baseball team is having a good time.
They’re having so much fun, in 
fact, that sophomore center fielder 
Jesse Franklin has dubbed the 
ballpark where they’ve been playing 
their games “TD AmeriPlayground.”
No other Wolverine, perhaps, 
is having more fun than Christan 
Bullock. The junior left fielder made 
some starts early in the season, 
including two against Binghamton 
on opening weekend as well as all 
three games at The Citadel. After 
some struggles, though, Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich replaced him, 
putting redshirt senior Miles Lewis 
in left field instead. 
But as the Wolverines have 
continued to fight for their season, 
coming up with clutch victories 
when they needed them most – and 
when they seemed least likely – 
Bullock has been at the center of it 
all. He’s been a regular starter since 

late May and has played a key role in 
several of those clutch victories. 
He had three hits and scored 
three runs in Michigan’s defeat of 
Nebraska on May 25 in the Big Ten 
Tournament. In the two victories 
over Creighton in the regional, 
Bullock combined for a single, a 
double, and a home run as well as 
three walks and another run scored. 
And in the Wolverines’ win-or-go-
home victory over No. 1 UCLA in the 
Super Regional, Bullock had a walk, a 
double, a triple, two runs and a stolen 
base.
Not too shabby.
“It’s exciting just to have the 
opportunity to do things that help 
the team win,” Bullock said. “I just 
want to play for my brothers.” 
As far as raw athletic ability 
goes, Bullock is, as Bakich puts it, 
“unbelievable.” He’s shown flashes 
of power-hitting potential and stellar 
defensive ability at times throughout 
the season. Most importantly, he’s the 
team’s fastest baserunner, something 
that’s resulted in him being used as a 

pinch runner in many situations. Not 
to mention, he’s compiled 13 stolen 
bases on the season.
“He’s a gamechanger with his 
speed,” Bakich said. “He can turn 
a walk into a triple within a few 
pitches. He’s one of those guys that 
when he puts it all together, I think 
he’s got a chance to be one of the 
more dynamic, explosive players, not 
only in the conference, but maybe 
in the country. I think he’s got an 
incredible toolset.”
For Bullock, the bigger issue has 
been consistency. Harnessing that 
speed. Finding a way to control that 
power-hitting and being able to tap it 
when needed. The difference-maker 
for Bullock during this time of the 
season – and what’s helped him 
make the jump back into the starting 
nine – is discipline. He’s beginning 
to understand the importance of not 
just the games, but the practices, the 
meetings, the training sessions. He’s 
dedicated to the team, not just in the 
big moments, but in every moment.
“Consistency is just his key to his 

success,” Bakich said. “We’ve worked 
really hard on that consistency, 
starting in the training sessions 
and carrying over into the games. 
He’s always been a gamer, where he 
wants to turn it on in the game. As 
he’s matured in our program, he’s 
understood the importance of all the 
little things, the attention to detail.”
Now, Bullock is finally seeing 

the payoff of that discipline, that 
dedication. On the highest stage in 
college baseball – one of the biggest in 
collegiate athletics – he’s coming up 
huge for the Wolverines with over-
the-shoulder catches, stolen bases 
and clutch hits in tense moments.
“Being consistent always pays off,” 
Bullock said. “I’m just trying to do 
anything to help win a game.”

Erik Bakich named Coach of the Year

With the sun beating down on 
Creighton’s patchy turf practice 
field, the Michigan baseball team 
walked to the left field line and 
waited in the ranks for practice to 
begin.
Slowly after them came the man 
who would run practice, dressed 
in the same clothes as each of the 
players — distinguishable by only 
a bright yellow string around his 
neck. He blew his whistle, and the 
players were off.
While 
other 
coaches 
were 
mingling about the infield or 
watching the players warm up from 
afar, Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
was amidst the players, with them 
every step.
On Saturday morning, three 
hours prior to the Wolverines’ first 
game in the Men’s College World 
Series since 1984, Bakich was given 
the National Collegiate Baseball 
Writers Association’s Coach of the 
Year Award.
“It means we’ve got great 
players, 
great 
coaches, 
great 
support 
staff, 
great 
player’s 
parents, great coaches wives. We 
talk about deflecting individual 

honors all the time because they’re 
not done by any one person,” 
Bakich said. “All the credit, in 
my opinion, goes to all the other 
people that make this team great 
and that touch our program. So it’s 
a nice award, and I said this when I 
accepted it, I accept this on behalf 
of our team and all the people that I 
just mentioned because they’re the 
ones who did it.”
It’s always been about making 
something bigger for this team. In 
the team’s mind, this isn’t the 2019 
Michigan baseball team, it’s team 
153 — just another in a long line of 
baseball teams for the program. 
But don’t let Bakich’s deflection 
take your mind off him. He’s the 
one who created that culture, who 
sets the tone.
He’s the one who tells freshman 
left-hander Walker Cleveland after 
his first collegiate win, “Remember, 
it’s about the team.”
He’s taken those steps to make 
this team bigger than a group of 35 
students.
“You know, the first year I 
was here, there were no minority 
players on our team,” Bakich said. 
“Maybe this is just a personal 
philosophy or preference, but I just 
feel that at this school, especially 

given its legacy, our roster should 
look like the United States of 
America.”
Bakich’s 
talents 
go 
beyond 
culture 
setting, 
though, 
and 
throughout the year he’s made 
tough calls and spent days working 
with his team to put them in the 
position they’re in. In the middle 
of the Big Ten season, he switched 
left-hander Tommy Henry to a 
Saturday starter after a few games 
of struggling, and Henry settled 
back down in his new role.
As the playoffs began, he 
dropped 
season-long 
closer, 
freshman 
right-hander 
Willie 
Weiss in favor of one of his two 
starting pitchers. He also dropped 
senior outfielder Miles Lewis from 
the starting lineup, who started 59 
games this year, in favor of a hot-
handed Christian Bullock.
The 
Wolverines 
may 
have 
gotten hot at just the right time. 
They may have caught “lightning 
in a bottle,” and shocked college 
baseball with their run, but as 
Bakich alternated between hitting 
fly balls to the outfield and gently 
knocking ground balls to his son 
twenty feet away, it was clear that 
Bakich was the one who put the 
bottle there.

Henry untouchable in complete-game shutout against FSU

OMAHA, Neb. – Nine innings. 
100 pitches.
Most starting pitchers reach 
that number in five, maybe six 
innings. Seven or even eight, on a 
really good night. 
Not Tommy Henry. And not in 
Omaha.
In the biggest game of the 
Michigan baseball team’s season, 
the junior left-hander pitched 
a complete game of three-hit 
baseball Monday, shutting out 
Florida State in a 2-0 victory for 
the Wolverines.
“We got the best pitching 
performance of Tommy Henry’s 
career,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “We needed a strong 
performance, and he gave us 
something magical tonight. I 
think we’re all just in awe.”
Facing a Seminole lineup that 
has been especially dangerous 
with the long ball, to which Henry 
has been notably susceptible all 
season – the Seminoles have 81 on 
the season so far – pitching coach 
Chris Fetter helped come up with 
a plan to mix up Henry’s pitches 
and keep the ball low and around 
the plate all night.
The 
plan 
required 
nearly 
flawless 
execution. 
And 
that 

was exactly what Henry gave 
Michigan. It was a testament to 
the consistency and dedication 
that Henry has shown all season, 
all while battling bicep tendonitis 
in the second half of the season 
that saw him struggle with his 
consistency.
“The first thing I think about 
when I think of Tommy is his 
discipline 
and 
consistency 
and how truly consistent he is 
throughout the year,” catcher 
Joe Donovan said. “That’s been 
Tommy the entire year. The 
discipline to keep the balls low in 
the zone, to not miss. If he does 
have a miss, the next pitch was – I 
think he shook me off after a hung 
breaking ball, and the next one 
was one of the dirtiest ones I’ve 
ever caught from him.
“That’s him in a nutshell: 
keeping the ball low in the zone, 
pounding it, discipline, taking 
breaths, the whole nine yards on 
it, and that’s been what we’ve seen 
from him this entire time. That’s 
just Tommy Henry for you.”
For Henry, the execution and 
mindset Monday were routine. 
Coming off a dominant start in 
the Wolverines’ eventual 4-2 
victory over No. 1 UCLA, Henry 
was confident in the plan, and 
more importantly, in his pitching.
“We just tried as a pitching 

staff to come out here and do 
what we’ve done all year – attack 
the strike zone and play the 
numbers,” Henry said. “A great 
hitter is going to get out seven out 
of ten times, so if you attack the 
strike zone, you force the issue, 
and let the defense work, and you 
saw that tonight.”
Henry also got plenty of help 

from his defense, which seemed 
to be exactly where the ball fell all 
night, as well as from sophomore 
center fielder Jesse Franklin, who 
crushed the first pitch he saw in 
the top of the first inning for a 
towering home run that ensured 
Henry pitched the whole game 
with a lead.
Pitching from ahead changed 

his mindset completely.
“Pitching with a lead is much 
easier than pitching behind or in 
a tie game,” Henry said. “It gives 
you the freedom to just attack and 
to watch the defense work and let 
them make the plays, not have to 
do too much. So to be able to do 
that from the first time you step 
on the mound is fun.”

Michigan one win away from CWS Final after 2-0 shutout

OMAHA, Neb. — As the number 
of innings played marched closer 
to nine, the Michigan baseball 
team found itself in another close 
pitching duel.
The Wolverine offense was 
sputtering, but Tommy Henry 
was there to give them every 
chance they needed under the 
lights.
The junior left-hander went 
all nine innings for Michigan 
(48-20 overall, 2-0 World Series) 
Monday, totalling nine strikeouts 
in just 100 pitches en route to a 
2-0 win over Florida State (42-22, 
1-1).
Henry was given the benefit 
of playing with a lead thanks to 
early fireworks as sophomore 
center fielder Jesse Franklin 
swung at the first pitch offered to 

him, launching a rocket to right 
field that sailed over the bullpen 
and into the upper deck for a 1-0 
lead in the first inning.
“Going into the game we 
weren’t 
necessarily 
thinking 
to swing at the first pitch or 
anything like that,” Franklin 
said. “As hitters in general we 
were just trying to look for 
fastballs early in the game to hit 
hard.”
Added Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich: “I think any team that 
scores first has a little bit of 
a confidence and a looseness 
about them that allows our — 
the freedom of being able to take 
chances on the bases, to employ 
some different types of plays, 
whether it be first-and-third 
plays or just being aggressive on 
the bases.”
The Seminoles attempted an 
answer with a leadoff double to 

center field in the bottom of the 
first. A diving Franklin couldn’t 
make the highlight reel catch, and 
Mike Salvatore was in scoring 
position with no one out. But 
their offense floundered as three 
straight batters were retired.
They wouldn’t get another 
baserunner until the fifth inning, 
as Henry shut down Florida State, 
barely breaking a sweat. Of the 
five batters he allowed on base, 
two were hit by a pitch.
“It’s easy when you can trust 
those guys behind you and just 
kind of watch them work and let 
them make the highlight plays,” 
Henry said.
When the Seminoles made 
contact, though, it would seem 
to always go to a Wolverine 
defender. 
Junior 
left 
fielder 
Christian practically stood still, 
letting fly balls nestle into his 
waiting glove.

“Coach Schnabel and Coach 
Brdar, the defensive positioning 
tonight I thought was fantastic, 
as well,” Bakich said. “It seemed 
like we had a lot of at ‘em balls 
tonight and that’s because our 
guys were standing in the right 
spot.”
Seminole right-hander CJ Van 
Eyck countered with his own 
magic, striking out nine batters 
and 
stifling 
any 
momentum 
Michigan could gain.
“Tommy covered up a lot of 
mistakes 
offensively 
tonight,” 
Bakich 
said. 
“Not 
making 
adjustments to some tricksters 
out of the bullpen, the sidearm 
guy and then the backwards 
mixer lefty.”
But the Wolverines fought 
through their at-bats. Bullock 
had a nine-pitch at-bat, and the 
team had six at-bats with six 
pitches or more against Van Eyk. 

All the work tired him out, and 
Michigan found success against 
him again in the fifth inning as 
he surpassed 100 pitches.
Two straight singles from 
sophomore 
designated 
hitter 
Jordan Nwogu and Franklin put 
runners on the corners with one 
out and the game saw its first 
scoring opportunity since the 
second inning. Van Eyck struck 
out junior right fielder Jordan 
Brewer, but senior first baseman 
Jimmy Kerr hit a two-out single 
to put the Wolverines up 2-0.
It was all that they needed 
with Henry on the mound.
It didn’t matter that they 
struck out 17 times, it didn’t 
matter that Bullock had to make 
plays in left field and it didn’t 
matter that Nwogu’s fifth-inning 
slide into third will make its 
rounds all over the internet.
Henry was just that good.
