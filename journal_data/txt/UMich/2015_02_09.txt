200 students 
build consumer 

products at second 
annual Makeathon

By JING JING MA

Daily Staff Reporter

The Art and Architecture 

Building buzzed with energy 
Saturday afternoon as students 
sketched designs, drilled wood 
and wired hardware. More than 
200 students tried their hands at 
building physical products rang-
ing from collapsible skis to stress-
relieving stones.

Makeathon, held Friday and 

Saturday, is an annual competi-
tion where students team up to 
brainstorm and create innova-
tive products. Participants com-
peted in one of three categories: 
Health & Wellness, Environment 
& Energy and Entertainment & 
Toys.

MPowered, a student orga-

nization that promotes student 
entrepreneurship, launched the 

competition in 2013. MPow-
ered is also responsible for simi-
larly focused events, including 
MHacks, 1000 Pitches and Start-
up High School.

Last year, the University of 

Michigan-Dearborn 
hosted 

Makeathon, with about 100 par-
ticipants. This year, the event 
doubled in size and was held on 
North Campus.

Art 
& 
Design 
sophomore 

Arwin Wang, Makeathon direc-
tor, said the event’s change in size 
yielded a minor change in focus 
as well. To give the event a more 
defined 
purpose, 
Makeathan 

featured three themes: Health & 
Wellness, Environment & Energy 
and Entertainment & Toys.

“Last year the event was very 

open-ended and people could cre-
ate whatever they wanted,” she 
said. “We want people to come 
up with innovative ideas and cre-
ative ways to create a product that 
solves a real problem.”

auditorium of the Art and Archi-

closing ceremony Sunday after-

U.S Supreme Court 
justice talks gender, 

prominent cases

By SHOHAM GEVA and 

TAYLOR WIZNER

Daily News Editor and

Daily Staff Reporter

U.S. Supreme Court Justice 

Ruth Bader Ginsburg spoke 
about her life and opinions on 
Supreme Court cases at Hill 

Auditorium Friday morning as 
part of the annual Tanner Lec-
ture.

Speaking to a full auditorium 

of over 3,000 students, faculty 
and community members, Gins-
burg discussed the issues that 
have defined her career, such as 
gender and voting equality.

Ginsburg, who was appointed 

to the Supreme Court by Presi-
dent Bill Clinton in 1993, has 
seen 
several 
landmark 
civil 

rights cases during her time on 
the Court. These include United 

States v. Virginia, which dis-
cussed 
whether 
state-funded 

educational institutions could 
refuse to admit women, and Shel-
by v. Holder, which considered 
portions of the Voting Rights 
Act. During her time as a law-
yer, she litigated multiple major 
cases concerning several aspects 
of gender discrimination.

Law Prof. Scott Hershovitz 

and Assistant Law Prof. Kate 
Andrias, who were both former 
clerks for Ginsburg, moderated 
the Q&A discussion-style event, 

using their own questions and 
some supplied by the audience 
prior to the event.

Andrias began the Q&A, ask-

ing why Ginsburg went into law 
when so few women were in the 
field.

Ginsburg said she was inspired 

by the atmosphere around civil 
rights, citing in particular the 
Red Scare during the 1950s, 
which led to many individuals 
being arrested on suspicion of 
Communist ideology.

“The idea was that lawyer is 

the profession, but it’s also some-
thing that arms you with the skill 
to make things a little better for 
other people,” she said.

She added that her choice 

lay between business and law 
school, and her graduate school 
of choice, Harvard, had not yet 
opened its business school up to 
women.

At a time when there was very 

little mention of women’s status 
in the law, Ginsburg said she sub-
sequently began her legal focus 
on gender equality in the 1960s, 

while she was teaching at Rut-
gers University and serving as a 
volunteer lawyer with the Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union.

Rather than being self-initiat-

ed, she said both a student push 
for a class on gender equality law 
and a growing number of com-
plaints to the ACLU concerning 
gender equality drew her atten-
tion to the subject.

Her first foray into the area 

came when the legal director 
from the New Jersey ACLU affil-

Muslim Student 

Association dinner 
features traditional 
cultural elements

For the Daily

Celebrating achievement and 

faith, the Muslim Student Asso-
ciation hosted their annual ban-

quet Friday night with a menu 
of traditional Arab cuisine and 
a lineup of speakers and perfor-
mances.

The event, held in the North 

Campus 
Research 
Complex, 

drew about 200 alumni, stu-
dents and other guests who 
gathered to celebrate MSA 
accomplishments during the 
past semester.

Many guests wore traditional 

clothing in nearly every color of 
the spectrum, and crystals often 

adorned the hijabs, or heads-
carves attendees wore.

The 
MSA, 
comprised 
of 

approximately 250 active mem-
bers, works toward building a 
Muslim community on campus 
through community service, 
social 
connections, 
religious 

enrichment, social justice and 
interfaith relations.

optiMize; University alum David 
Merritt, founder of Merit Good-
ness; and Michael Finney, senior 
economic adviser to Republican 
Gov. Rick Snyder, all participated.

The University is home to sever-

al programs focused on entrepre-
neuship, including the Center for 
Entrepreneurship, the Samuel 
Zell & Robert H. Lurie Institute 
for Entrepreneurial Studies and 
Medical Innovation Center.

The panelists agreed that 

innovation and entrepreneurship 
have become increasingly impor-
tant over the last few years due 

to the interdisciplinary nature of 
problems facing the world today.

“Today’s world demands grad-

uates prepared to be highly col-
laborative problem solvers ready 
to tackle big challenges,” Zurbu-
chen wrote.

Sorensen, 
who 
co-founded 

the 
entrepreneurship-focused 

student organization optiMize 
while he was a student on cam-
pus, encouraged students to get 
involved in the world around 
them and pursue their ideas.

“Students need to ask ‘why not 

me?’ and innovate to solve (the 
problems)!” Sorensen wrote.

Even for students who major 

in a subject seemingly uncon-
nected to entrepreneurship and 

innovation, Zurbuchen wrote 
that thinking like an entrepre-
neur is still necessary.

“(Entrepreneurship) (is) also 

more than just starting a busi-
ness,” Zurbuchen wrote. “It’s 
a necessary state of mind that 
views opportunity in a chal-
lenge.”

Similarly, Zurbuchen said stu-

dents do not necessarily need to 
be part of a startup business to 
get involved.

“Not everybody needs to be 

a startup founder!” Zurbuchen 
wrote. “It’s about seeing and 
growing innovation, even in big 
companies.”

Merritt, a former Michigan 

basketball player who started 
his own business, recommend-
ed researching the market and 
connecting with the commu-
nity to create a solid group of 
customers and followers.

“Find people that believe 

what you believe,” Merritt 
wrote. 
“People 
buy 
‘why’ 

maybe even more than ‘what.’ ”

While the panelists also 

noted that the process often 
involves 
failure, 
LaPierre 

wrote that failure does not 
always result in negative con-
sequences.

“Failure 
isn’t 
inherently 

bad,” LaPierre wrote. “Fail 
fast, move on and learn from 
your mistakes. And share your 
learnings with others.”

Merritt added a slightly dif-

ferent take — he said he defined 
failure not as failing to reach 
a goal, but as not making the 
attempt in the first place.

“Success is giving it all you 

have,” Merritt wrote. “It’s not 
a destination, it’s appreciating 
the process. The failure is in 
not trying.”

In a ddition to the social 

innovation opportunities on 
campus, Zurbuchen said there 
are over 10 University projects 
focused on Detroit and other 
regions in Michigan.

Speaking to the state as a 

whole, Finney, Snyder’s senior 
economic adviser, wrote that 
Michigan is growing various 
technology industries, such as 
information technology, bio-
technology and agriculture. 
He also wrote that Michigan is 
a great location for technology 
industries due to the concen-

rently the chaplain and executive 
director of the Muslim Chaplaincy 
at the University of Toledo.

During his speech, Tarsin dis-

cussed spiritual empowerment 
and concepts of unity and diver-
sity.

“I think that one of the beautiful 

things about places like the Uni-
versity of Michigan, and just kind 
of the commitment to diversity as 
a whole, is that people can agree 
on really broad primary principles 
and values,” he said. “For example, 
helping those in need, not harming 
one another, live and let live and 
working together on areas of over-
lap and agreement.”

Tarsin 
also 
noted 
Islam’s 

emphasis on personal freedom.

“I believe, as a Muslim, as an 

educator within Islam, is that 
everyone is free to choose their 
belief, their walk of life and I really 
believe that believing in that free-
dom of expression, that freedom 
of choice, is a thing that is a part of 
our religion,” he said.

At the event, Zain Shamoon, a 

Michigan State University student, 
delivered a spoken word perfor-
mance.

Shamoon discussed the right to 

choose one’s own path and the con-
nections that bind all people, as well 
as an interactive song referencing 
cultural staples from the 1990s.

MSA President Saher Rathur, an 

LSA senior, said the organization 
provided her a Muslim community 
on campus.

“When I was in high school I 

wasn’t really part of any Muslim 
community and I didn’t really 
have Muslim friends growing up,” 
Rathur said. “When I came here 
I had heard about this MSA and 
about how it’s very active and the 
people are great. So I was like, 
‘Okay, might as well try it out,’ 
and I did, and I just never stopped 
going to their events.”

MSA also collaborates with 

MSA 
organizations 
at 
other 

schools. This past semester, they 
held a joint dinner with MSU as 
well as a weekend retreat with 
Ohio State University.

LSA junior Farah Alam, MSA 

sisterhood social chair, said the 
organization aims to be inclusive.

“Something you can really con-

nect on is our faith,” Alam said. 
“For the most part this is a priority, 
so finding other people that share 
the same belief system, and com-
ing together, is just a good way to 
get a better college experience.”

Alam added that this year’s 

event differs from previous years.

“Many years ago, back when 

our holy month of fasting, Rama-
dan, was in the summer (it moves 
up two weeks every year), it used 
to be a big dinner to commemo-
rate and break our fast with family 
and friends,” Alam said. “Now it’s 
become a social dinner that every-
one looks forward to every year.”

LSA junior Dana Mosa-Basha 

is not a member of MSA, but said 
she attended the event to support 
her friends who are members. Like 
most guests, Mosa-Basha wore a 
traditional ensemble to the event.

“I’m involved because I go to 

school here and I’ve met a lot of 
people along the way,” Mosa-Basha 
said. “They have a bunch of events 
throughout the year so I really like 
to go. They have 18 board members 
and each one has different tasks 
and things to do, so it’s a really 
wide array of events, so I like to go 
to everything they have.”

22 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK (FEB. 10, 1993) 

University investigates funding 

The University’s Depart-

ment of Public Safety, the pre-
cursor to the current Division 
of Public Safety and Security, 
investigated the Office of 
Student Affairs for allegedly 
misappropriating $8,000 in 
funding.

The money was originally 

found missing from the Psy-
chology Annex — a complex 
attached to West Quad that 
housed several departmen-
tal 
offices, 
including 
the 

Department of Psychology, 
the Undergraduate Research 
Opportunities Program and 
the Sexual Assault Awareness 
and Prevention Center.

DPS Lt. Vern Baisden said 

he could not comment on 

which office in the annex 
misused the funds.

“The 
necessary 
reports 

have been presented to the 
prosecutor and formal charg-
es are pending,” he said.

At the time, representatives 

from the Washtenaw Country 
Prosecutor’s Office declined 
to comment on the investiga-
tion.

11 years ago this week 

(Feb. 10, 2004)

The 
University 
Health 

Service ran culture tests in 
the hopes of revealing the 
contagion that caused a cam-
pus-wide outbreak of viral 
gastroenteritis, often known 
as the stomach flu.

These tests were run even 

though UHS Director Rob-
ert Winfield said the illness 
might have been the Norwalk 
virus — also known as the 
“winter vomiting virus” — not 
the flu.

A total of 83 cases of the 

flu were reported on campus, 
according to University Hous-
ing spokesman Alan Levy.

Similar 
outbreaks 
had 

occurred at the University 
before, the cause of which 
was found to be the Norwalk 
virus, exposed to students by 
faulty food preparation in the 
dining halls. 

This outbreak was found to 

only have affected those students 
living in the residence halls.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
John Misty is an 
odd businessman

Freaky folker makes 

a statement about 
money in music

By RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writer

Right now, you were supposed 

to be reading a review of his new 
album I Love You, Honeybear, set to 
release this Tuesday. I was going to 
rave about his past efforts, how I’m 
still humming “Hollywood Forev-
er Cemetery Sings” from his 2012 
album Fear Fun. Then, probably go 
into great detail about his growth 
as an artist, and maybe even touch 
on a few of his weird antics like 
that one time he went to a shaman 
and started hallucinating about 
baguettes and berets. It was going 
to be awesome. It’s a shame then, 
that Misty likes fucking with us.

Painter, drummer, singer, song-

writer, shroom-taker – Josh Till-
man found and lost God while 
growing up in an Evangelical 
community. Under the name 
J.Tillman, he attempted to cre-
ate a musical career with some 
solo projects, though the music 
took itself too seriously and was 
mostly unsuccessful. In 2007, he 
got his big break, of sorts, when he 
joined the band Fleet Foxes as the 
drummer. With 2012 approaching, 
and after leaving Fleet Foxes, he 
adopted the moniker Father John 
Misty, and the rest, as they say, is 
history. He became a swagger-
ing, indie sex symbol by jumping 
and jiving on stage, a large devia-
tion from his former projects. And 
now, here we are, anxiously await-
ing his sophomore effort.

Most albums leak to the Inter-

net before their actual release 
dates. If you know which sketchy 
sites to scrounge, you can find 
almost anything before it’s sup-
posed to drop. A lot of artists even 

stream their stuff in its entirety 
beforehand. And, it appeared 
Misty had done the same. In fact, 
he seemed to have gone above and 
beyond, creating his own stream-
ing site, SAP.

Sounds too good to be true? 

That’s because it is.

Turns out, SAP exclusively 

streams only I Love You, Honey-
bear. But, take a quick exploration 
of the site and you’ll realize that it’s 
Misty’s way of poking fun at the 
current state of superficial music 
sharing on the Internet. He’s com-
menting on the misguided belief 
that musicians are selfish for want-
ing to make money off their work.

“Did you know that music can 

also be expensive to make? Some 
artists have discovered that shar-
ing their music for free can be 
tough financially,” the site reads. 
“Is there a way to prevent anyone 
from spending money ever?”

After scrolling for a while, 

the site explicitly reveals its true 
intentions. Misty calls SAP a “pro-

Daily Book Review: 
‘Girl on the Train’

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

As “The Girl on the Train” sits 

atop the U.S. bestseller list for 
the second week in a row, people 
are clamoring to figure out how 
it got there. The book’s title and 
jacket offer no clues; the blockish, 
white font and blurred foliage on 
the cover are appealingly generic, 
but don’t offer any hints at the 
breathless ride contained within 
the pages. First-time author Paula 
Hawkins doesn’t have as recogniz-
able a name as the other tenants of 
the week’s bestseller list, including 
tenured thriller writers like James 
Patterson and David Baldacci. But 
the secret to the book’s success 
can be found in the plot summary 
on the inside cover: told from the 
point of view of multiple unreliable 
narrators — a seemingly-perfect 
wife gone inexplicably missing — 
the inscrutable husband is not who 
he appears to be — “The Girl on the 
Train” is shamelessly riding the 
coattails of “Gone Girl” ’s success.

But “The Girl on the Train” 

transcends its apparent “Gone 
Girl” copycat status. Hawkins 
borrows plot and tone from film 
noir and classic British thrillers; 
her prose is more Hitchcockian 
than Flynn-ian. The book centers 
around Rachel Watson, an unem-
ployed alcoholic who rides the 
train to “work” every morning, 
using the train’s stops as an oppor-
tunity to spy on the perfect, min-
iature lives she can see from the 
tracks. She’s created a fictional life 
in her mind for “Jason” and “Jess,” 
a handsome couple whose home is 
just a few doors down from where 
Rachel and her husband used to 

live. As she looks out her window, 
Rachel can forget that she’s a sad, 
unemployed drunk and play the 
anonymous spectator, soaking up 
the afterglow of other people’s 
happiness to get her through the 
hours between gin and tonics on 
the train. In an interesting twist 
on classic Hitchcock voyeurism, 
the woman has the power to look, 
and readers see everything from 
her point of view. Rachel is flawed, 
and seeing through her eyes is all 
the more interesting because of 
her foggy vision.

Yes, foggy vision. Since Rachel 

is an alcoholic, she’s prone to get-
ting blackout drunk at the worst 
possible moments, like at the 
scene of major crimes and when 
she’s hanging out with the sus-
pects of those crimes. Of course, 
Rachel can’t remember what hap-
pened when she left the train and 
stumbled around Witney the night 
“Jess” disappeared. And more 
generally, her way of dealing with 
the complication and confusion 
of leaving her voyeuristic seat on 
the train for the action beyond the 
tracks is to drink herself into obliv-
ion. When Rachel loses track of 
those intoxicated hours, so do we. 
Hawkins drops clues and hints, 
but obscures them in so much mud 
that readers can’t do the detective 
work themselves. The only way 
to pick up more hints is mediated 
through Rachel’s knowledge. Her 
poor decisions are infuriating, but 
the impenetrability of the mystery 
makes the book impossible to put 
down.

While Rachel’s sections of the 

book are vivid and exciting, the 
passages dedicated to Megan (the 
Witney woman who disappeared) 

and Anna (Rachel’s ex-husband’s 
new wife) falter. The sections 
detailing Megan’s life before the 
disappearance hold a fair num-
ber of clues and false starts, but 
Megan is a disappointing wisp of a 
character — artistic, pixie-like and 
not much else. Anna is even worse. 
Her entire personality is based on 
her dislike of Rachel, and Anna’s 
passages don’t contain anything 
interesting, as she spends most of 
her days whining to her husband 
and complaining about Rachel. 
In theory, she’s an effective foil 
for Rachel because she’s prim and 
put-together and maternal, every-
thing Rachel wishes she could 
be. But we don’t gain much from 
reading Anna’s point of view, aside 
from the dullness of her passages 
making Rachel’s feel even more 
vibrant.

However, the plot and narra-

tion aren’t what really make a 
good thriller a great thriller. The 
mystery is the beating heart of 
any excellent crime drama, and 
“The Girl on the Train” succeeds 
in this regard. I won’t dare spoil 
any of the breathlessly twisty 
plot, but the switch from dark-
ness and impossibility to finally 
finding out what happened with 
Megan makes for one of the 
most visceral, fun reading expe-
riences I’ve had in a long time 
(since “Gone Girl,” probably). But 
whether or not the novel’s suc-
cess is due to its comparison with 
another smash female-driven 
mystery, “The Girl on the Train” 
deserves all the buzz it’s garner-
ing. It’s a thrilling, intoxicating 
ride from its familiar start to its 
triumphant finish at the top of 
the bestseller list.

noon. The winners of each of the 
three categories received $1,000 in 
prize money.

Apollo 257, a toy light that allows 

the user to direct colors, won the 
Entertainment & Toy category. 
MyBot, a wheelchair controlled by 
a Myo armband, won in Health & 
Wellness. Green Energizer, a solar-
powered backpack that allows 
the wearer to charge electrical 
devices, carried the Environment 
& Energy category.

Engineering 
junior 
Nick 

Naruns, the creator of Green Ener-
gizer, said he got the idea from 
being outside for long periods of 
time and realizing he had no way 
to charge his phone when it ran out 
of battery.

Naruns said he would like to add 

more features to the backpack and 
integrate the solar panel into other 
wearable accessories. Eventually, 
he plans to sell a finished version of 
the product.

“I think there’s still some work 

that needs to be sorted out but I 
definitely think it’s a marketable 
product,” he said.

Wang 
said 
she 
wanted 

Makeathon to be a place where 
anyone could come, test their 
ideas and collaborate with others 
regardless of their academic field 
or previous experience.

Students could either enter the 

competition with their own teams 
or receive a team upon arriving 
Friday evening. Some came with 
specific projects in mind while 
others attended to network and 
receive hands-on experience with 
hardware.

“One of our goals is to bring peo-

ple from all disciplines together to 
collaborate,” Wang said. “It’s inter-
esting because Friday we were 

scared that people who didn’t have 
a team would go home and not 
come back. But people have really 
bonded and formed new teams just 
like that.”

President 
Barack 
Obama’s 

administration has promoted a 
“Maker Movement” on a national 
scale to encourage people to make 
and sell tangible items. Wang said 
a White House liaison for the 
Maker Movement has been in con-
tact with the Makeathon planning 
team.

Engineering 
freshman 
Pas-

cal Sturmfels, a computer science 
major, said he was excited to gain 
experience with new hardware 
and to “meet people interested in 
computer science and hardware 
and have that connection, if any-
one wants to work on a project 
with me in the future.”

Engineering senior Gabriella 

Willis planned to use the event to 
build a prototype system aimed 
at providing food for low-income 
families. She employed aquapon-
ics — a food production strategy 
that is fertilized by the excrement 
of aquatic creatures, like snails or 
prawns.

“The aquaponics idea is some-

thing I’ve had in mind, but I’ve 
never tried to build,” Willis said. “I 
think this is the perfect opportu-
nity to get my hands dirty and see 
what happens.”

Makeathon featured a variety 

of “building stations,” including 
accessibility to a woodshop, metal 
shop and laser cutters. These 
were available for use during the 
day, but closed at 10 p.m. every 
night due to safety concerns about 
sleep-deprived students operating 
potentially dangerous machines.

Because the deadline for proj-

ect submissions was early Sunday 
morning, students began to feel 
the time crunch Saturday night as 
10 p.m. approached. Some teams 

who started out with ambitious 
ideas found that they had to scale 
down or scrap their plans as the 
event neared its end.

Other groups focused on com-

pleting 
smaller-scale 
projects. 

One such project was an adjust-
able grab bar whose height could 
be easily adjusted with one hand. 
Representatives 
from 
General 

Electric praised the project for 
being well designed, functional 
and easily operated.

At the event’s expo Sunday 

morning, students showed off their 
product prototypes. Some were 
complete and functioning while 
other projects were still works-in-
progress. Teams were enthusiastic 
about continuing to develop their 
products.

Qi Zhang, a Ph.D. candidate 

in the Department of Molecular, 
Cellular and Developmental Biol-
ogy, said his team created a small 
computer encased in a wooden box 
designed for integration into liv-
ing room furniture. The computer 
could be used to operate a variety 
of home technologies.

“As a business, we want to take 

the internal components of your 
Xbox or your PS3 and put them 
into a minimalistic (compartment) 
and design furniture that will 
house them… and remove clutter 
in the room,” Zhang said. He and 
his team hope to eventually bring 
their product to the market.

Wang said she ultimately hopes 

that large-scale recognition of 
maker culture — at the University, 
as well as local and national levels 
—will help the event grow in the 
future.

“People need to know that 

entrepreneurship 
and 
startups 

aren’t just about apps. There’s 
value in physical products,” she 
said. “Making is intuitive to 
humans. We need to be able to 
touch things to use them.”

iate asked her to review three 
cases brought by women about 
gender discrimination at work 
and in school, part of the first 
wave of court cases involving 
that issue.

“Women who until then just 

accepted the way things were, 
and then because the women’s 
movement was reviving all over 
the world, decided they shouldn’t 
simply submit to the way things 
were — they should decide the 
way things should be,” Ginsburg 
said.

Ginsburg said the turning 

point for gender equality in the 
Supreme Court came after the 
unanimous decision on the 1971 
case Reed v. Reed, in which the 
Court amended the social secu-
rity law to ensure equality for 
women as estate holders. Gins-
berg discussed how the court 
perfected the law to say sole 
surviving parent, whether male 
or female.

“If a law is imperfect, some-

times the appropriate cure is not 
to strike it down, but to extend 
it to the let down people,” Gins-
berg said.

Ginsburg also spoke about 

some of her recent dissents 
on the court, in particular the 
Court’s 2014 decision to over-
turn a portion of the Voting 
Rights Act and 2010 decision 
to modify campaign contribu-
tions.

Addressing the Voting Rights 

Act, she said she viewed the case 
primarily as a determination 
of who is more suited to decide 
electoral issues.

“The legislature had over-

whelmingly said the Voting 
Rights Act should be extended,” 
she said. “Should nine unelected 
judges trump that decision of 
the legislature? And my attitude 
was no, that the members of the 
political branch probably knew 
more about voting and elections 
then the unelected Supreme 
Court Justices do.”

Asked 
what 
decision 
she 

would overrule if she could, 
Ginsburg pointed to Citizens 
United v. Federal Election Com-
mission. She said whenever she 

goes abroad she is faced with 
questions about why the United 
States allows unlimited cam-
paign 
contributions, 
which 

many say allows officeholders 
to be influenced by campaign 
financiers.

“There will be a time where 

people are disgusted with this 
and the pendulum will swing 
the other way,” Ginsburg said.

When 
asked 
about 
her 

approach to reading the Con-
stitution overall, Ginsburg said 
she relied primarily on the first 
three words of it — “We the peo-
ple” — though she noted that her 
interpretation of their meaning 
is fluid.

“I think the genius of our 

country is that now over two 
centuries, this notion of who 
counts in ‘we the people’ has 
grown,” she said.

Ginsburg may have surprised 

the audience by expressing criti-
cism of the Roe v. Wade deci-
sion, and said the ruling created 
more of an uphill battle than if 
state legislatures had approved 
abortion rights on their own.

“If the court had been more 

modest, than the change would 
continue to move in the direc-
tion it was already moving,” she 
said. “Instead, there was one 
target for those who opposed a 
woman’s free choice, and that 
one target was Roe v. Wade.”

Ginsburg also touched briefly 

on the Equal Rights Amend-
ment — language first proposed 
in 1923 that specifies that states 
may not deny “rights under the 
law” on the basis of sex — when 
asked what amendment she’d 
most like added to the Constitu-
tion.

“I would like to take my Con-

stitution out and show it to my 
three granddaughters and say 
‘This is a value of our society, 
just like free speech — the equal-
ity of men and women,’ ” Gins-
burg said.

Toward the end of the discus-

sion, Hershovitz asked if Gins-
burg had any advice for young 
people in the audience.

“If you think of yourself of a 

professional, well you’re not just 
going to get a job so you can turn 
over a buck,” Ginsburg said. “If 
you do that you’re like a plumb-
er. You’ve got a skill and you can 

earn a living from it. But if you 
think of yourself as a true pro-
fessional armed with a skill, you 
could help someone who is less 
fortunate.”

Ginsburg did not touch on 

a Michigan case that is slated 
to go before the U.S. Supreme 
Court in April, DeBoer v. Sny-
der, which concerns the state’s 
ban on same-sex marriage.

However, in an interview 

after the event, Law Prof. Margo 
Schlanger, also a former Gins-
burg clerk from 1993 to 1995, 
said she was confident Ginsburg 
would vote to strike down the 
ban.

“I have no doubt in the world 

that she will think that equal-
ity demands nondiscrimination 
in marriage,” Schlanger said. “I 
don’t know what the court will 
do, but I don’t have a minute’s 
doubt about what her vote will 
be.”

Law student Lauren Dansey 

said she was excited to hear 
Ginsburg’s speak as she has long 
been a fan of the justice, having 
read many of her opinions.

“Right now she is my mod-

ern day heroine,” Dansey said. 
“After reading her opinions, she 
is not only a beautiful writer 
and articulate theorist, but 
she’s also inspirational.”

Dansey added that she appre-

ciated her comments about the 
Voting Rights Act.

“Relative to what she voted 

for, I would not have thought 
that was not something she was 
passionate about,” she said.

LSA senior Victoria Bell, who 

noted she dressed up for Hal-
loween as the persona associ-
ated with Ginsburg’s popular 
nickname, the Notorious RBG, 
said she found hearing the 
justice speak in person inspi-
rational. During the session, 
Ginsburg also said she finds the 
nickname amusing.

“I dressed as notorious RBG 

for Halloween, and I think it 
was really inspirational to be 
here, hearing her speak,” Bell 
said. “My favorite part was 
probably hearing about what she 
had to say on the UVI case and 
all the arguments she did before 
she appointed a justice, because 
that was some really powerful 
work that she did.”

T

he Robert J. Delonis Center 
for the homeless moved to 
its current location on West 

Huron Street 11 
years ago. Thanks 
to 
$5.5 
million 

in private dona-
tions, along with 
an additional $3 
million in county 
and 
city 
allo-

cated funds, the 
Delonis 
Center 

became a progres-
sive and unique 
hybrid center of 
general residency 
and warming shelter. It practices 
a “housing first” initiative, which, 
according to Ellen Schulmeister, the 
Delonis Center’s Executive Direc-
tor, is a philosophy that views the 
acquisition of permanent housing as 
“the big answer” to ending the often 
perpetual cycle of homelessness.

Permanent supported housing is 

a different style of care for homeless 
populations than the traditional, 
mission-style shelter, or shelters 
that merely provide food and short-
term, temporary housing for the 
homeless. According to John Schip-
pers, Delonis’ Director of Programs, 
this model leaves little opportunity 
for societal ascension. Schippers, an 
incredibly passionate psychologist, 
describes this method as a “come 
in, get fed, repeat as necessary,” 
cookie-cutter tactic to combating 
homelessness which “the literature 
pretty clearly shows … perpetuates 
homelessness.” Conversely, a “hous-
ing first” initiative seeks to empow-
er the homeless by providing them 
with an individually formatted plan, 
outlining the necessary steps need-
ed to achieve permanent residence.

At the Delonis Center, this key 

program is called Income, Sav-
ings and Housing. The program is 
centered on the individual, who 
first meets with one of the Delo-
nis Center’s 12 case managers. 
Each case manager is an educated 
social worker; there is a base level 
requirement of a bachelor’s degree 
in social work, though many have 
their Masters in Social Work. The 
case workers act as triage special-
ists, measuring new patients’ needs 
on a vulnerability scale, a combi-
nation of assessments based on 
the person’s ability status and age, 
among other factors. In doing so, 

case workers seek to evaluate the 
steps needed to navigate existing 
bureaucratic structures in order to 
establish some sort of income for 
the person in question, and to estab-
lish a savings plan for whatever 
income they’re eligible to receive. 
To this effect, the Delonis Center’s 
case managers are fixers; whatever 
obstacles an individual has, they’ll 
try to tackle them head-on.

“There are many barriers to 

ending their homelessness and 
we have to help them overcome 
those,” Schippers said. “Everyone’s 
got their own individual stories, so 
everyone’s housing plan is unique.” 
And sometimes that “unique hous-
ing plan” can mean that an individ-
ual must stay in the Delonis Center 
general residential unit for longer 
than the 90 days subsidized by the 
government while they’re saving for 
a security deposit on an apartment. 
Though the Delonis Center must 
rely on generous private donors 
to pay for the differential in time, 
Schippers said, “If you’re exiting 
people in 90 days, all you’re doing is 
sabotaging them, in my opinion. If 
they’re working on a housing plan, 
they get to stay.”

The construction of a shelter 

which operates in this fashion was 
a challenge for facilitators like 
Schulmeister and Schippers, who 
had to work at convincing the pub-
lic of the specific, systemic issues 
facing the Ann Arbor area that per-
petuate homelessness in the com-
munity. When Schulmeister joined 
the Center 17 years ago, she tried to 
make this clear.

“I kept saying ‘the shelter is not 

going to solve the problem. The 
shelter is going to help the prob-
lem, but we need to have afford-
able housing.’ That was 17 years 
ago. And we have not made a lot of 
progress in affordable housing in 
 

17 years.”

According to one report, the 

monthly cost for a one-bedroom 
apartment in Ann Arbor ranges 
from $850-$1,200; for someone 
with an entry level job, attempting 
to gain footing after having been 
homeless for a stretch of time, the 
chance of finding a fiscally sustain-
able apartment in the area is bleak.

“There’s all these barriers to 

getting housing. Not only is it not 
affordable, but it’s also not acces-
sible,” 
Schulmeister 
lamented. 

“We’re supposed to eliminate the 
shelter stay… and just put people 
into housing. Well you can’t do that 
if you don’t have housing. So where 
are we?”

Where are we? It seems the 

answer is that we’re stuck within 
yet another paradoxical circle, 
unbreakable due to a system that 
ostracizes homeless individuals by 
not providing them with the sweep-
ing changes in advancement pro-
grams needed to catalyze upward 
mobility. Schulmeister sees it as 
a combination of factors, many of 
which stem from the public, which 
she considers to be “completely 
oblivious” to the struggles that the 
homeless face in this community.

“(Homelessness) 
just 
doesn’t 

touch their life enough that they 
choose to think about it or do 
anything,” she told me. “Every-
thing about the public’s percep-
tion 
exacerbates 
the 
problem. 

But I don’t know how you ever 
have everybody on the same page 
about what to do. That seems 
like 
an 
impossibility 
to 
me.” 

Asking the public to make sense 
of a population whose plights 
are ever changing, whose chal-
lenges are innumerable, is dif-
ficult. “There’s an ebb and flow,” 
Schulmeister said. “There’s always 
a 
new 
twist. 
There’s 
always 
 

something different.”

But in a society where value and 

worth are placed on the positions 
that people hold and how success-
ful they are in those positions, it 
becomes castrating for those with 
limited ability to reintegrate into 
society. Especially into a society 
which views them as lesser. This is 
obvious, especially when consider-
ing the ways that the homeless are 
ostracized and downtrodden. They 
are affected by the way that public 
opinion and housing systems have 
created a palpable mental barrier 
between society at large, and those 
subjugated by it.

Delonis’ ISH program works dil-

igently towards empowering indi-
viduals, affirming their self-worth 
through the tactical use of local 
employment and housing resourc-
es. In order to house the homeless, 
however, perhaps larger factors are 
in need of reevaluation.

I

t recently came to my attention that 
bars across the University campus have 
drink menus that do not align with my 

personal morals or the 
morals of many friends 
and mentors. Drinks such 
as the Blowjob and Dirty 
Girl Scout, among others, 
play off of humor that is 
in no way family friendly 
but may be excusable for 
certain eyes. Titles such 
as these may make a res-
taurant only accessible to 
adult eyes, but do not nec-
essarily cross a morally 
impenetrable line in my view.

Reading further down the menu at Blue 

Leprechaun on South University, I stumbled 
across a drink called Statutory Grape. At the 
time, I thought this drink was particular to 
this bar, but soon discovered that many menus 
on the University campus and in other cities 
featured such an appalling item. This wave of 
disappointment hit me around late September 
last year and only escalated this past weekend 
when my father was in town and had a harsh 
reaction to such a feature as well.

As I have never been a victim of any sort of 

sexual crime, I do not have the authority to 
say what a drink name like this would spark 
in me had I experienced such a traumatic 
event. But I do know that to trivialize what 
can be such a severe experience into a drink 
name is beyond outdated and beyond disre-
spectful. After speaking with peers, mentors 
and even the wait staff and general manager 
of Blue Lep, I found that everyone was in a 
relatively unanimous agreement: the drink 
name should be removed. Some “inappropri-
ate” drinks I can let skate by, but others have 
crossed a line that should never be crossed.

I met with Mike Gradillas, the general 

manager of the Blue Leprechaun, expect-
ing a curmudgeon of a man who would not 
be receptive to the idea at all. Instead, I 
found the exact opposite in his character. 
We carefully looked at each menu item, and 
discussed the implications of each item and 
what it could mean, who it could hurt, if the 
wait staff could “handle” it and if they could, 

“should” anyone be able to handle some-
thing unpleasant that could potentially be 
a trigger? It is impossible to imagine what 
everyone has gone through, what bizarre 
or mundane words could propel someone 
into reliving a terrible experience. But there 
is a certain point where we, as upstanding 
members of society, can speculate that the 
drink “statutory grape” could be linked to an 
unfortunate memory.

Dan Caldwell, a waiter at the Blue Lep, 

made many poignant remarks on this subject. 
He specifically stated, “You never know what 
the people walking through your bar have 
gone through.” Specifically with the drink 
Statutory Grape, there is no reason why the 
item must persist. In suggesting renaming 
the drink, Gradillas said, “I don’t even need 
a memory of it. It’s just not worth it.” So not 
only is the name being eliminated, but also the 
drink itself is being told off. Gradillas said, “I 
do care about the image of the restaurant, but 
on a more personal level, I am responsible.”

Gradillas claims that he had often ques-

tioned these off-putting titles, but had never 
been approached by someone, so he never 
made the move for change. Obviously, the 
responsibility cannot solely lie in anyone’s 
lap, but it does show how times can change 
and the often times negative residue of the 
past can stick.

“We are dealing with college, where there 

is often times a fine line between having an 
experience where someone may unfortu-
nately question whether or not an encounter 
was rape,” Gradillas said.

Any restaurant, especially one so close 

to a university, should not be making light 
of an issue that is so prevalent on a col-
lege campus. Gradillas similarly took it 
upon himself to change The Red Headed 
Slut to The Red Head without any efforts 
on my part. He also reminded me that if 
a woman or man ever feels disrespected 
by a client at the restaurant, they have 
bouncers who are well equipped to remove 
 

any individual.

Although most people with whom I have 

spoken to agree at the obscenity of the title, 
those playing devil’s advocate, bring up the 
line that differentiates rape and statutory 

Statutory Grape

rape. The legal dictionary defines 
statutory rape as being, “… com-
mitted when an adult sexually pen-
etrates a person who, under the law, 
is incapable of consenting to sex. 
Minors and physically and mentally 
incapacitated persons are deemed 
incapable of consenting to sex 
under rape statutes in all states.” 
There is the case where a young 
couple could be technically com-
mitting this crime even while hav-

ing consensual sex, however, this 
is not always the case. As the legal 
dictionary addresses, this offense 
is serious and should in no way be 
taken lightly.

This is not just an issue of femi-

nism; these experiences can hap-
pen to anyone. It is our duty as 
students to call attention to these 
issues 
and 
spread 
awareness. 

Often times it just takes one voice 
to sway a cause. Although I have 

only spoken with the Blue Lepre-
chaun, I imagine these drink items 
will be evaporating quickly off of 
university 
campuses. 
Although 

students do not carry the solitary 
responsibility to spark change, 
we do have the youth and pas-
sion to speak out about causes of 
 

any scale.

I

t has been long suspected that the division of Ann Arbor’s wards 
has lessened student influence in city politics. According to a 
recent report by The Michigan Daily, the large concentration 

of students who live on Central Campus and the immediate 
surrounding area has been divided since 1967 into five pie-shaped 
city wards, or representative districts, that converge at the center 
of campus and span outwards. Seeing that no ward’s population 
is comprised of over 29.4 percent University students, leaving no 
ward with a student majority, the impact of the student vote in 
city elections appears to be diminished. That said, the creation of a 
student-majority city ward is not the right step to increase student 
influence in Ann Arbor City Council decisions. Rather, a system that 
encourages students to get involved in the city is a better-suited 
solution moving forward.

Redrawing boundaries to create a student-

dominated ward would not be unprecedented. 
The University of California, Berkeley student 
population passed a measure last November 
that created a student-majority district 
in Berkeley. Burlington, VT, home of the 
University of Vermont, recently announced a 
new student ward, Ward 8, in which students 
will make up 70 percent of the population.

A student-majority ward would bring 

benefits to the student population and the city, 
but is not a realistic solution for increasing the 
student population’s political involvement for 
local initiatives. The student population of the 
University is just recently becoming politically 
active in the local realm and experiences 
constant population change with students 
graduating each year. Of the 34,000 students 
eligible to vote, only 7,000 are registered to do 
so. In addition, out of those 7,000, only 1,900 
voted in the past election. Therefore, if students 
do not vote in a ward specifically devoted to 
them, elections will remain an inaccurate 
representation of the student population’s 
concerns, meaning the issue remains unsolved.

Creating a student-majority ward should not 

be a priority. Instead, the student population 
needs to participate in city government at 
an increased rate. Recently, tension between 
students and the city has revolved around 
issues of affordable housing, transportation 
and taxes. If students carried more political 

sway, some of these problems are more likely 
to be solved. While the University is large and 
may dissuade students from taking action in 
order to solve important issues, if students 
were more aware of the impact they could 
make on city issues, it would bridge the gap 
between the city and the University, one that 
has grown and continues to do so.

To increase student involvement without 

the creation of a student-majority ward, a 
student committee should be formed within 
the Office of Student Life. This committee 
would help facilitate student gatherings 
where City Council issues could be discussed. 
These student leaders will run the meetings, 
regulate debate and collect student opinions 
to act as liaisons between students and City 
Council members. City Council members 
should make an effort to come to some of 
these “town hall-esque” meetings and meet 
with committee members on a regular basis 
to hear student concerns and consider them 
when making their decisions. This type of 
forum would allow students to have the 
opportunity to take leadership roles in the 
city, become more involved with members of 
the community beyond campus and become 
real stakeholders in government decisions. 
The opinions and solutions generated from 
these forums will lead to informed City 
Council decisions and a more accurate 
representation of the student population.

“W

HAT?!” 
That’s 

usually the first 
reaction people 

give me when they 
find out I grew up 
without cable tele-
vision. The con-
versation 
would 

include 
some, 

“What did you do 
then?” 
and 
the 

occasional, 
“Do 

you 
even 
know 

what ‘SpongeBob’ 
is?” The list goes on 
between disbelief, 
shock and inter-
rogating me to see how I lived my 
unplugged life. It was as if they felt 
sorry for me for missing references 
and having a childhood that lacked 
me sitting in front of a screen. I may 
have had a lapse in cartoon knowl-
edge, and even today I still do, but 
I like to think I turned out normal. 
I was not really addicted to televi-
sion. Yes, I loved my basic shows like 
“Arthur” and “The Simpsons,” but I 
did not have Nickelodeon, Comedy 
Central or Disney Channel. It made 
me feel like some type of alien, a 
minority that was not up to date on 
the cool new shows with the pletho-
ra of channels at my whim.

Those that grew up without 

TV can relate. Many of my friends 
found it to be a blessing. We seemed 
to spend more time outside, having 
play dates with friends and reading 
good books. In my family, we would 
play softball in the backyard or bas-
ketball in the driveway after dinner 

instead of plopping down in front of 
the TV. We saw it as an occasional 
privilege, rather than some amenity 
that was always at our disposal for 
our entertainment.

But now that beneficial detach-

ment is gone. It seems that those 
born in the early ‘90s can still appre-
ciate a time when not everything was 
plugged in. We were not surrounded 
by technology in every realm, be it 
school, home or relaxation. We were 
not as dependent upon our devices, 
but rather we were left to our own. 
We grew up with cassette tapes, VHS 
movies, Walkmans and the begin-
ning of cell phones. Slow and bulky, 
those technologies were easy to put 
away. If you wanted to call someone, 
you actually had to know where they 
were, none of this “Dude, where are 
you?” If you wanted to check the 
time, you looked at your watch. And 
we definitely did not do the “pocket 
dance” (front pocket, front pocket, 
back pocket, back pocket, “found it!”) 
to find our phones before we left the 
house. Those born in the later ‘90s, 
however, seemed to be “on” all of 
 

the time.

Elementary-school 
kids 
have 

the latest iPhones, video games 
and computers. There was never a 
“No Cell Phone” policy in my 5th-
grade classroom, but now there 
is. Younger kids always need to 
be on something, whether they 
are playing a game, finding some 
new 
information 
or 
watching 

some goofy video on YouTube. If 
the devices are taken away, their 
boredom increases and their atten-

tion span decreases. Short videos, 
grabbing technology, flashy images 
and modes of information are how 
these children grew up learning to 
read, write, listen and comprehend. 
Those of the early ‘90s grew up dif-
ferently, and now there is a disjunc-
tion within our generation.

We are extremely social beings. 

Anthropologically speaking, the 
reason we have such large brains 
could be due to the Social Brain 
hypothesis. This states that ancient 
human ancestors that began to live 
in larger groups with patterns of 
social structures showed greater 
brain growth of the neocortex. 
Humans need to be social. It is liter-
ally in our DNA. But trying a detox 
every once in a while can help us 
relax and disconnect from the rest 
of the world and the websites and 
devices connecting us all.

Can you appreciate the silence? 

Have you spent time without your 
computer, cell phone or TV for 
more than a day? When was the 
last time you wrote a paper or did 
an assignment by hand? It is won-
derful never feeling like you have 
to report to someone, check in on 
the latest e-mails or texts. You even 
have the chance to perfect your 
penmanship! It takes a little time to 
get used to, but that freedom — that 
chance to focus on only what is in 
front of you and not what is in your 
pocket connecting you to someone 
 

else — is wonderful.

This is what it looks like to limn the yonic curse.
Lena Dunham is 
‘Not That Girl’

‘Girls’ creator 

explores the female 
experience in memoir

By ANDREW MCCLURE 

Daily Arts Writer

Better late than never, Lena 

Dunham’s first novel works no 
less because of its September 
release. She brings us a mem-
oir that doesn’t require the new 
millennium to render a rele-
vant, timeless in its timeliness, 
book we sort of need.

Dunham is neither that kind 

of girl nor any type of girl that 
we, an educated people, have 
seen enough throughout cul-
ture or history to file them into a 
“type” to begin with. She’s also 
not the voice of a generation, 
as much as her onscreen per-
sona Hannah (HBO’s “Girls”) 
would like to contend. She’s just 
a girl, but a girl unafraid to say 
the things 20-somethings of 
her, well, circumstances (read: 
gender, shape, affluence) won’t. 
She’s also unafraid to ironically 
choose pink title letters for the 
hardcover of her first book, 
“Not That Kind of Girl: A Young 
Woman Tells You What She’s 
‘Learned,’” and to unironically 
hang quotations marks around 
the subtitled word “learned,” 
confessing the very ephemera 
of her gleanings.

By now, we’ve heard it all 

— the minimal praise, the 
diatribes, the diatribes, the 
diatribes. But Dunham has 
imported 
something 
much 

more important than vapid troll 
fodder in her memoir-essays, 
“Not That Kind of Girl,” a prin-
ciple so essential as we, the 
majority, go forward trying on 
various masks to better fit in: 
her supreme vulnerability.

I take issue when critics 

— people supposedly good at 
expressing passion with dutiful 
dispassion — mistake Dunham’s 
vulnerability 
for 
pejoratives 

like “oversharing” or “self-
important.” 
Newsflash: 
vul-

nerability can, and often will, 
offend. Once her candor show-
ers over you, albeit lukewarm 
at first, her riffs on family and 
experience are not so blinkered, 
but rather expansive.

The prose is divided into five 

not-mutually 
exclusive 
seg-

ments, from “Love & Sex” and 
“Body” to “Friendship” and 
“Work” to “Big Picture.” These 
cabinets are less for organiza-
tion and more for Dunham to, 
with probable irony, “cover 
all the bases” that a good-girl 
memoir should.

She opens her introduction, 

“I am twenty-years old and I 
hate myself,” pegging at the 
same time her darkest and least 
relevant line, as the couple hun-
dred pages that follow limn her 
ultimately upbeat and tough-
minded anecdotes and mus-
ings. She may have wept during 
bits of the production process 
but, now, finished, she seems 
poised to share some of her 
dreck bereft of smelly crowd-
pleasing, with some chapters 
markedly weaker than others, 
notwithstanding.

Her bite-size reflections and 

sprinkled Nickelodeon-like car-
toons not only establish a girl-
ish, journaling aesthetic, but 
her lexicon is so tempered that, 
really, a little girl could read 
it. Not unlike a future Olym-
pic sprinter taking it easy in 
P.E., Dunham packs punches 
like, “Jared was friendlier than 
cool guys are supposed to be,” 
wholly cognizant of her dic-
tion before concerning herself 
with sounding smart. It seems a 
tough pill to swallow for a writ-
er so capable of morphing that 
sentence into A Sentence, in all 
its erudition.

And her poetics, her unique 

voice — this is her most 
invaluable asset. This is also 
what makes “Not That Kind 
of Girl” a good read, a read 
that with cogency connects 
young women to young men to, 
maybe if they’re with the times, 
older people. She intuits much 
like, selfishly, I did and do: 
Describing her heated phone 
conversation with Mom over 
how she needs her mom “in 
a different way than before,” 
Dunham 
writes, 
“‘That’s 

fucking bullshit.’ I can tell 
she’s in a store.” That hardly 
recognizable 
pause 
between 

her mother’s words, the light 
background chatter Dunham 
discerns, 
is 
unexceptional, 

but opting to include this 
afterthought, little yet nuclear, 
plays to Dunham’s advantage 
all book long.

She’s funny, too, but seldom 

in a sidesplitting way. Sidesplit-
ting is for punchlines, but her 
book is by and large without 
them. She toys with secrets that 
are strange enough to credibly 
be hers, like the list of things 
she’s afraid of at age 8: leprosy, 
unclean meat, milk, homeless 
people, foods my mother hasn’t 
tasted first so that if we die we 
die together, et al. Whereas Fey 
and Poehler, and their respec-
tive memoirs, are driven by 
improv-laden, Harvard Lam-
poon true comedy writing, 
Dunham is not a trained comic, 

and her book doesn’t read like 
one, for the better. Dunham 
makes you laugh in a to-your-
self manner, half-pondering her 
semi-repressed intellect and 
half-envying her honest wit, so 
honest that it’s almost not wit 
at all.

In her final, appropriately 

mawkish chapter, called “Guide 
to Running Away,” Dunham 
gets the closest to her book’s 
beating heart. Of her mother, of 
all of our mothers, I presume, 
she writes, at age 9, “You are 
mad at your mother because 
sometimes 
she 
doesn’t 
pay 

attention and she says yes to a 
question that needs a different 
kind of answer.” Then, in the 
same vein, but at age 27: “You’re 
the one who’s distracted while 
your mother tries to talk. you’re 
the one who thinks fathers just 
need to get through their father 
problems.” 
Her 
growth, 
in 

mind and body, has manifested 
but she, as a smart person 
should, stays skeptical in really 
knowing anything for certain. 
She has come this far — with 
the wounds to prove it — not 
to create that girl or the girl or 
even a girl, but rather her girl, 
heading toward womanhood 
with all of her idiosyncrasies in 
tote, including the prickly ones.

‘Street Art’ doesn’t 
make for good TV

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Street art used to be a form 

of artistic personal expression, 
a rebellion against the Man, 
consumerism, 
the patriarchy 
or 
whatever 

else the artist 
desired. 
Art-

ists like Banksy 
and 
Basquiat 

brought street 
art 
into 
the 

mainstream, 
pushing 
the 

boundaries 
of 

pop culture just wide enough to 
let street art have a recognized 
and respected place within it. 
Oxygen’s new show “Street Art 
Throwdown” takes the concept 
of its raw, organic creativity and 
twists it into a reality TV show. 
While street art is a newer prem-
ise for a show than some of the 
other dime-a-dozen reality series 
that focus on fashion or singing, 
this show’s dedication to the 
strict checklist of reality tele-
vision ensures that it gives the 
least amount of screen time to 
the most important part: the art 
itself.

In the pilot “Welcome to the 

Streets,” 10 street artists (six 
of whom are women) are intro-
duced, all competing against 
each other to win a $100,000 
prize. There are two challenges 
of each episode; the “hustle” 
and the “throwdown,” both of 
which are timed. The goal of this 
episode’s hustle was to put up a 
“tag” (also referred to sometimes 
as a throw-up, a general term that 
refers to an artist’s personal sig-
nature) on a high-rise billboard. 
With a style that mimics that of 
“Project Runway” or “America’s 
Next Top Model,” the two judges 
— Justin Bua and Lauren Wagner 
— analyze each tag and critique 
them based on originality, tech-
nical execution and style, giving 
feedback to the artists in front of 
each other.

During the throwdown chal-

lenge, the artists had to navigate 
through an underground tunnel 

maze to find a good spot to paint 
a portrait of someone who has 
inspired them. The judges again 
walk around asking questions 
about each artist’s technique and 
inspiration, accompanied this 
time by a guest judge, street art 
legend Mear One. At the end of 
the throwdown, Bua and Wag-
ner chose two competitors who 
excelled, two who needed to step 
it up and one who had to go home.

As of yet, there are no specific 

personal rivalries or cattiness as 
is so often characteristic of these 
types of programs. The competi-
tor who struggled during the 
throwdown challenge received 
some free, cheerfully given les-
sons from another competitor 
on how to use spray cans, and 
when she eventually was chosen 
to go home, she also received 
hugs from everyone. While the 
artists revealed various degrees 
of nervousness or confidence 
through their interviews and 
interactions with the judges, 
the judges themselves showed 
no emotion whatsoever. Bua in 
particular gave the competitors 
only a cursory, vaguely dismis-
sive “interesting” on more than 
one occasion.

“Street Art Throwdown” has 

the potential to focus on some-
thing different that, even though 

there are gallery exhibitions and 
websites dedicated to it, people 
don’t get to see firsthand very 
often. The most interesting 
part by far is watching the art-
ists work. Seeing the different 
styles — bubble or block letters, 
expressionist 
finger 
painting 

or quick, fluid movements with 
spray cans, bold and obnox-
iously clashing colors or more 
traditionally compatible color 
schemes and designs — and how 
each goes about creating his or 
her designs is legitimately fas-
cinating. But the focus on the 
art and artists themselves often 
felt overshadowed by everything 
else: dizzying camera angles, the 
race to the top of the billboard, 
the night-vision scenes of the 
competitors trying to navigate 
the tunnel maze and the Hunger 
Games-esque battle for supplies 
after the clock starts ticking 
and, of course, several gratu-
itous shots of the judges’ skepti-
cal looks.

You can watch “Street Art 

Throwdown” for the art, and try 
to catch the parts that do capture 
a bit of intriguing originality; but 
you’ll have to filter through the 
competitiveness of the players 
and the emphasized snark of the 
judges first — not to mention the 
obnoxious background music.

age group, I was 
the only person 
seeing Sponge-
Bob alone on a 
Friday 
night. 

In all fairness, I 
actually (sadly) 
didn’t have any-
thing better to do.

“The 
SpongeBob 
Movie: 

Sponge Out of Water” marks 
the second foray into film for 
the Bikini Bottom crew, and 
the first in 10 years. For this 
adventure, the stakes are set 
as high as they can be when a 
botched scheme by Plankton 
results in the loss of the recipe 
for Krabby Patties. The ensuing 

uproar 
forces 
SpongeBob 

and Plankton to team up and 
find the recipe before Bikini 
Bottom’s descent into chaos 
becomes irreversible.

While the driving force of 

the story (finding the recipe) 
is simple enough, the plot is an 
exercise in over-the-top ridicu-
lousness. This is best exempli-
fied by the introduction of an 
extraterrestrial dolphin that 
apparently oversees the galaxy. 
Of course, no one sees “Sponge 
Out of Water” expecting suc-
cinct, thoughtful storytelling. 
They see it for the jokes.

Much of the film’s comedy 

is fart/poop based. This per-
haps doesn’t appeal to the col-
lege demographic, but it is a 
kids’ movie after all. There are 
moments where the comedy 
reaches higher points, such as 
when 
Plankton’s 
computer 

wife, Karen, escapes from cap-
ture and she’s shown to have 
carved in the walls of her pris-
on “CTL + ALT + DEL,” and 
other phrases one might expect 
from a robot going insane from 
imprisonment. The rest of the 
humor surely comes from a con-
nection to the old characters — 
Patrick is dumb, Squidward is a 
stick in the mud and Mr. Krabs 
is cheap.

Though the title of the film 

and the promotion surround-

ing it implied there would 
be extensive scenes with the 
main cast stranded on land, 
that doesn’t come to fruition 
until the climax of the film. 
During the sequence, Sponge-
Bob (Tom Kenny), Patrick (Bill 
Fagerbakke), Mr. Krabs (Clancy 
Brown), 
Squidward 
(Rodger 

Bumpass) and Sandy (Carolyn 
Lawrence) receive some assis-
tance from a deus ex machina 
that transforms each of them 
into their superhero equivalent. 
The crew relinquishes their 
powers for the sake of returning 
things to normality, but Squid-
ward finally catches a break 
and gets to keep the washboard 
abs of his superhero-self.

The live action antagonist 

pirate, Burger Beard (Antonio 
Banderas, “Once Upon a Time 
in Mexico”), doesn’t add much 
to the film comically, but the 
conclusion of his story ties up 
the universe nicely, revealing 
Burger Beard to be the portrait-
ed pirate that famously calls 
kids to the ready before each 
“SpongeBob” episode.

In the end, “Sponge Out of 

Water” isn’t great, nor does it 
aspire to be. It’s purposefully 
targeted to young children, 
bringing them the joy of laugh-
ter and teaching them an age-
old, ever-salient lesson about 
the value of teamwork.

A violent response to
‘A Most Violent Year’

By ANDREW MCCLURE

Daily Arts Writer

I can’t even say, let alone think 

anything, about the title of “A 
Most Violent Year” without using 
a Queens English enunciation, 
each syllable sharing equal parts 
attention and glottal contraction. 
That we, the audience expecting 
a gritty, violent gangster-like pic-
ture, are left with our leading man 
Abel (Oscar Isaac, “Inside Llewyn 
Davis”) 
borrowing 
overloaded 

rhetoric from J.C. Chandor’s sin-
ewy script leaves something — 
everything — to be desired: like for 
Abel to talk with, at least, minor 
imperfection as if he actually has 
something to lose, something 
human. The movie never compels 
us to lend a hand to Abel, someone 
so multifaceted yet one-dimen-
sional that we can’t care about 
his cause because we never really 
understand why, or are even con-
vinced that he actually wants to 
corner the heating-oil market.

This is not a diatribe. It’s not 

because I’m about to, with econo-
my in mind, say some good things. 
Bradford Young (“Selma”), the 
film’s director of photography, 
lenses with meticulous care, cul-
minating in a bridge chase scene 
where his cam snakes between 
standstill traffic followed by a 
tracking shot backpedaling just 
fast enough to keep our sprint-
ing subject framed finely. Pictori-
ally, his daylight scenes bleed a soft 
blue and his night shots play with 
moody contrast, almost to ques-
tion the so-called moral compass 
of our Abel, whose grayish-black 
pompadour often fades into the 
unlit back.

Isaac’s Abel, I think, does what 

he can given the weakness of a 
script that burps lines like, “When 
it feels scary to jump, that is exact-
ly when you jump, otherwise you 
end up in the same place,” a blurb 
better engineered to tell your kid 
growing up than in a movie that 
wishes it had the same spine as 
that aphorism. Isaac’s delivery, his 
acting, with these ambition-wet 
lines feels, if anything, actorly. His 
knee-kissing sandy overcoat and 
bespoke suits create the illusion of 
an oil baron better than his actual 
words, which are heavy like lead 
and preachy like a preacher. But 
worst of all, all of this overact-
ing and fatless writing could be 
rendered negligible had our Abel 
showed us, proved to us, that this 
expansion he “dreams” of was, 
in fact, a dream of his. Instead, 
it falls limp as an empty drive to, 
um, build a bigger manse? Prove 
to the other dickhead NYC barons 
that he reigns supreme? The lat-
ter could’ve worked, but the movie 
only pokes at these ostensibly 
more interesting characters.

The internet contends this 

movie is about “making it,” “Amer-
ica” and “making it in America.” 
But how can a movie so adamant 
on walking in dumb circles, from 
sidesplitting plot-point predict-
ability to Jessica Chastain’s on-
then-off bad Brooklyn accent, ever 
“make it” if the only glimmer of 
progress is a piece of land, one that 
signifies thicker profits but no pal-
pable emotional utility gained for 
the purchaser?

“Shucks!” goes the moviegoer 

when Abel’s immigrant employee, 
Julien, reappears in the final min-
utes of the film, after having been 
discarded by the script, to wave a 
gun around like a whack-job. We 
wince because Julien, eyes jaun-
diced and poor English tremulous, 
hints at what this movie could have 
been: A story about a real Ameri-
can Dream and how it, well, gets 
warped out of shape. It’s a slovenly 
denouement, but it would have 
been nice to see Abel show just half 
the vim, the quasi-psychosis, in his 
vocation that Julien did in being a 
lowly teamster.

“So you’re telling me you were inside Llewyn Davis?”

Getting hooked on 
Yung Lean’s enigma

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

“Where the hell did you find 

this?” a confused friend asks 
while watching and listening to 
Yung Lean’s “Hurt” music video 
for the first time. The video fea-
tures a random compilation of 
images and clips — Japanese 
writing, neon colors everywhere, 
Lean “cooking” with Arizona 
Iced 
Tea, 
computer 
screens 

from the early ’00s. I think of 
a response to explain that the 
Swedish rapper’s style and over-
all aesthetic is meant to be ironic 
and that its perplexing nature is 
purposeful.

Even then I am faced with 

more questions. Yes, he knows 
that it’s not actually 2002. No, he 
is not always a “sad boy.” I don’t 
know if he actually has a Louis 
duffle bag filled with heroin. No, 
this isn’t a joke — well, not really.

Despite my efforts, I could not 

find the words to communicate 
the appeal of Lean’s backward 
sound.

This encounter took place 

well over a year ago, and I am 
still unable to fully encapsulate 
the enigma that is Yung Lean. I 
think he is something you “get” 
immediately or will never really 
appreciate.

Lean’s flow is fairly relaxed, 

rapping his lyrics with a slack 
style. With contrast to the main-
stream rappers of today, with art-
ists like Wacka Flocka and Joey 
Bada$$, there is no urgency in his 
delivery. Rather, his style is more 
closely linked to other less-than-
conventional rappers like Lil B.

Mumbling his way through 

lyrics that don’t make sense most 
of the time, Lean somehow man-
ages to create something infec-
tious. For the most part, he sticks 

to the general rap lyric agenda — 
bragging about various states of 
inebriation and his ability to “get 
with” women — while somehow 
maintaining his “emotional boy” 
persona. Though entirely unprec-
edented, after a few listens, you 
can’t deny Lean’s swagger.

Even more striking than the 

lyrics are the beats support-
ing Lean’s voice. Most tracks 
include some combination of 
classic hip-hop snare drums and 
electronic-based melodies. The 
instrumentation is so intricate 
that, even without Lean’s vocals, 
it could stand on its own as a 
chill electro beat. There are hints 
of synth, echoing background 
vocals and round, rolling tones to 
create a sound that is undeniably 
Lean’s.

Traditionally, one would think 

that such low-key background 
music and slack style wouldn’t 
allow for an ignorant rap feel, 
yet Lean manages to defy these 

conventions. Tracks like “Ghost-
town” and “Ginsberg Strip 2002” 
are hype in their own sense of the 
word, they do not need to be in 
your face to get their point across.

What may be the most intrigu-

ing aspect of Lean’s identity is 
the way in which he presents 
himself and his music. Typifying 
his character are the bucket hats, 
the references to himself and his 
crew as “sad boys,” filling his 
music videos with psychedelic 
colors and making frequent ref-
erences to years 2001-2003. The 
way in which he markets himself 
is truly a product of the Internet. 
It makes no cohesive sense, but 
it’s cool and it works.

Maybe Yung Lean’s strength 

is that he is undefinable — he can 
be compared to others while still 
running a league all his own. I 
don’t think I will ever know how 
or why Yung Lean does what 
he does, all I know is that I’m 
hooked.

Irvin, former Mr. Basketball, 

scores team-high 23 in 
return to home state

By DANIEL FELDMAN

Daily Sports Editor

BLOOMINGTON 
— 
Emotions 
were 

undoubtedly high for Zak Irvin. The 2013 
Indiana Mr. Basketball was back in his home 
state and “jacked up” to help the Michigan 
men’s basketball team defeat Indiana.

Being the ringleader of a team dominated by 

Indiana natives — five in total — Irvin was going 
to have to step up if Michigan (6-6 Big Ten, 13-11 
overall) stood a chance against the Hoosiers.

But the sophomore forward needed to do 

more than just score on the court to help 
his team win — he also had to be in the game 
mentally and manage his emotions.

And in the first half, Irvin didn’t think he did 

that.

In the middle of an up-and-down season 

that started with Irvin being seen as the heir 
apparent to junior guard Caris LeVert’s role last 
year as the second in command on offense, Irvin 
has struggled adjusting his game to be more 
than just a shooter.

With 80 more attempts coming into Sunday’s 

game compared to last year’s season total, 
Irvin’s had to adjust to carrying a bigger load, 
impacting his shooting percentage, currently 
five percent lower than last year’s.

Having stayed in Ann Arbor for Camp 

Sanderson over the summer to add on strength 
and weight, Irvin was expected to be more 
of a stretch-four this year, rather than a small 
forward who would come in off the bench just to 
shoot when open. But as Michigan lost and the 
pressure grew for Irvin to produce, the stress 
got to him.

“He’s had some emotion earlier in the year 

that was not good,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “He would get down on himself. And 
now he can handle it much more.”

Sunday, though, Irvin showed progress both 

physically and mentally, finishing with a team-
leading 23 points.

“He’s got his head on right, and he knows 

that everybody has parts of their game they 
need to work on,” Beilein said. “And he realizes 
what some of those are, and he’s working on 
them. So, it showed today. Taking the ball to the 
basket and selecting those times to take it to the 
basket.”

Despite the shaky start, Irvin displayed 

confidence in the second half. He was calm 
playing the last 20 minutes, getting others 
involved, being aggressive and encouraging 
others.

Playing on such a young team, an added 

responsibility for Irvin has been to be more 
vocal. And by playing in an arena so dear to him, 
that presence was needed more than ever.

“He was passionate about winning the game 

today and talking to the team,” Beilein said of 
Irvin. “That’s an issue with a young team — we 
are very silent. It’s hard for some guys to come 
out of that, and even as a sophomore, and say, 
‘Hey, we’ve got to talk.’ ”

Abdur-Rahkman’s 3 falls 
short at buzzer, Michigan 
loses upset bid at Indiana

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

BLOOMINGTON — Before the season 

started, Michigan basketball coach John Beilein 
gave his team a poem. Titled, “It Was One 
Possession” by Jeff Smith, the poem describes 
a series of small mistakes that seem mild at the 
time, but ultimately add up to a loss.

The poem ends,

“In post game I sit at my locker,
Pondering what more I could do.
I realize the value of each possession,
what a shame that we lost by two.”

And on Sunday, months after he read the 

poem but only moments after his team lost 
its third final-possession game in the last two 
weeks, junior guard Spike Albrecht started 
looking back on the smallest things that 
could’ve gone differently.

Freshman guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-

Rahkman’s game-tying corner 3-point attempt 
bounced off the rim, inches shy of sending 
Michigan into overtime, resulting in a 70-67 
win for Indiana on Sunday at Assembly Hall.

But that wasn’t one of the possessions he 

wanted back most.

“Yeah, I mean, it came down to the last 

possession and things like that, but there were 
silly mistakes we made throughout the game,” 
Albrecht said. “I turned the ball over on the 
inbounds play, and it was within three, that 
could have been the difference. There was 
probably 10 different plays that if you take one 
or two those back, we might be celebrating right 
now in the locker room.”

But while Albrecht’s retrospective sentiments 

are the perfect embodiment of the poem, they 
leave out just how tough the Wolverines (6-6 
Big Ten, 13-11 overall) made it on Indiana.

While Indiana (7-4, 17-7) led nearly the entire 

game and ultimately won a thriller, Michigan 
kept itself alive for much of the game using spurts 
of scoring it hadn’t shown since losing junior 
guard Caris LeVert to a broken foot in January. 
Sophomore forward Zak Irvin had 23 points, 
one shy of his career high, and freshman center 
Ricky Doyle added 15 points and six rebounds.

“(Irvin is) doing much better at just picking 

his spots,” Beilein said. “He’s learning those 
things that give him a lot of latitude to explore 
these different options. He’s so much more 
than a shooter. He showed some of those things 
today, and he made some really tough outside 
shots that we needed at big times.”

For all of the well-deserved praise Irvin 

and the Wolverines earned after the game, 
the Hoosiers nearly buried Michigan early. 
When Indiana guard Yogi Ferrell wasn’t hitting 
big jump shots, forward Troy Williams was 
throwing down monstrous dunks and freshman 
guard James Blackmon Jr. was carving up the 
middle of the Michigan defense.

The Wolverines, however, weren’t going away.

The moral victory Michigan doesn’t need

H

ere they were again. 
In a game they weren’t 
supposed to stick 

around in, 
with a roster 
that lacked 
the depth to 
do so.

On this 

path through 
the season, 
the one 
that was 
disappointing, 
heartbreaking 
and yet still 
within reach, each shot and every 
break brought the Michigan 
men’s basketball team closer and 
closer to that same place.

For the third time in as many 

weeks, this time on the road in 
Bloomington, the Wolverines 
took a Big Ten team down to the 
final seconds. They led only once 
the entire game and trailed by as 
many as 11 — twice. And yet there 
they were in the final seconds 
with a chance to send the game 
to overtime, again.

Even as Indiana made shot 

after shot from deep and awoke 
the crowd with a dunk, Michigan 
was still in the game. Junior 
guard Spike Albrecht and 
sophomore forward Zak Irvin 
came down to the end, shooting 
and driving while everyone else 
watched.

Albrecht made a pair of free 

throws with 43 seconds left. 
Irvin, who had struggled to 
shoot, sank a 3-pointer from 
two feet beyond the arc with 
18 seconds remaining. And the 
Wolverines trailed one of the Big 
Ten’s best teams by just three on 
its opponent’s home court.

The week prior they had 

forced Michigan State into 
overtime. Before then, another 
overtime game against No. 4 
Wisconsin. Each one ended in a 
loss. Each one called a chance to 
grow. Each one labeled a “moral 
victory” by many.

“That’s our story,” said 

Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“We’re actually getting a little 
bit tired of it, but it beats the 
alternative of giving in, so we’re 
making progress.”

If Michigan could win, it could 

spark a run to the tournament. 
It could prove critics wrong who 
said without a healthy Caris 

LeVert or a healthy Derrick 
Walton, the Wolverines couldn’t 
make the tournament again. If 
they could 
win, they 
would be able 
to show they 
had learned 
and worked 
past those 
difficult 
defeats.

But when 

Michigan had 
its chance 
to show its growth, to show 
how far Albrecht has come as 

a scorer and how far freshman 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman’s confidence level 

has risen. To 
change the 
trend and walk 
away with an 
actual victory, 
it fell short 
with Abdur-
Rahkman’s 
3-pointer at the 
last second.

Another 

“moral victory” 

in a season of painful losses.

No one walked off the court 

looking satisfied, of course, 
because it’s still a loss. A moral 
victory, no matter how good 
it may feel, isn’t worth any 
bonus points or an asterisk in 
the standings. It’s just painful. 
And it’s not worth anything 
more to the NCAA Tournament 
committee, either.

Moral victories, in college 

basketball, are so commonplace 
that they happen every week. 
But this one, on this team, 
feels different. It’s a team that 
shouldn’t be in close games 
because it doesn’t have the 
pieces to. It’s a coach who, even 

when he faces the toughest 
stretch of his schedule, still 
figures out a way to put his 
team into game-winning 
positions.

Given Michigan’s history as 

of late, something more than 
a moral victory is expected. 
Five years ago, they would be 
encouraging. It shows just how 
far this team has come, because a 
trend like this doesn’t feel good. 
It feels awkward.

This moral victory, at 

the hands of Indiana, only 
compounds that pain, because 
now, as the season approaches 
its end, the future is less and less 
promising.

“We say (we’re) growing either 

in victory or defeat,” Beilein said. 
“We don’t like growing in defeat, 
but I believe we are.”

In college basketball, 

confidence and experience 
matter, but they don’t mean 
much unless they count as a win. 
There’s little time to reflect and 
grow from these victories.

“Right now, everyone keeps 

saying moral victories, but there 
are no moral victories,” Albrecht 
said. “So it was a disappointing 
loss and I was proud of the way 
we battled, but we’ve got to start 
finishing these close games.”

They don’t make the season a 

failure, but the moral victories 
don’t make a difference unless 
they turn into wins. As March 
approaches, there’s not much 
time to show how they pay off.

Because there are no moral 

victories when you’re not in the 
NCAA Tournament.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

The Michigan men’s basketball team again was within one basket of a huge upset, but after several close losses, the Wolverines sit at just 6-6 in the Big Ten.

“We don’t like 

growing in 
defeat, but I 

believe we are.”

GREG
GARNO

They made a pair of runs at the 
end of the first half, only to be 
pushed back by big 3-pointers 
from Ferrell and Blackmon. They 
made strides at the start of the 
second, too, but Hoosier forward 
Collin Hartman had an answer.

It seemed like Indiana would 

have Michigan worn down and 
be able pull away at the end.

And yet, with 3:30 to play, 

Albrecht hit a three to cut the 
Hoosier lead to 64-58, and 
Michigan 
started 
one 
more 

comeback 
effort.

With Doyle 

stepping 
up 

the 
interior 

defense, 
Michigan 
played 
tight 
inside 

and 
forced 

a 
couple 

turnovers. On the other end, 
Albrecht hit an And-1 layup to 
cut the deficit to three with one 
minute left.

Hartman and Albrecht, who 

scored eight of his 12 points in 
the final 3:30, traded pairs of free 
throws on their next possessions, 
wearing down the clock but not 
creating separation.

Then Williams unleashed a 

vicious dunk with 30 seconds 
left in the game, seemingly 
the knockout punch from the 
ever-answering Hoosiers. But 
12 seconds later, Irvin coolly 
answered 
with 
a 
3-pointer, 

pulling Michigan within two 
with 18 seconds remaining.

Hartman was intentionally 

fouled on his next possession and 
missed one of the two free throws, 
giving Michigan a chance to tie at 
the buzzer. The Wolverines tried 
to get Irvin free, but he couldn’t 
find an open shot. He worked it 
around the perimeter, and the 
ball eventually ended up with 
Abdur-Rahkman wide open in 

the corner with 
a chance to tie.

But 
the 

freshman’s 
triple was a few 
inches 
short, 

clanging off the 
rim and sealing 
a Hoosier win.

“It’s a very 

similar 
story 

to our Wisconsin and Michigan 
State games, where we’re proud 
of our kids’ play and how hard we 
worked,” Beilein said. “I’d love to 
have some possessions back and I 
know that we’ll learn from them.”

It is a similar story, but Beilein, 

Albrecht and the Wolverines are 
still treating it like the poem, 
and pondering what more they 
could do.

MICHIGAN

Playing with his back against 

the wall, Irvin had to step up 
to overcome the Hoosiers (7-4, 
17-7). Taking 13 of Michigan’s 
shots in the second half, Irvin 
knocked down seven, including 
three 3-pointers to keep the iron 
hot for the Wolverines.

While Michigan couldn’t leave 

Assembly Hall with a win, it 
would not have even come down 
to a final possession if not for 
Irvin’s triple with 18 seconds left 
to make it a one-possession game.

With the game clock winding 

down, he had a chance to tie the 
game and bring it into overtime, 
but instead of forcing up a wildly 
contested 3-pointer, he started 
the passing around the arc, 
with the ball ultimately finding 
freshman guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman. His last-
second attempt fell short.

Though it’s coming to the 

point 
in 
Michigan’s 
season 

where actual wins are needed 
over moral ones, the play of 
Irvin is a promising sign for 

a team with fleeting NCAA 
Tournament chances.

“That’s the Zak Irvin we need 

the rest of the year,” said junior 
guard Spike Albrecht. “This was 
a very big game for him. There 
was a lot of pride on the line 
being an Indiana guy. He really 
stepped up today.”

“He’s so much 
more than a 

shooter.”


By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Writer

Two 
minutes 
into 
the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s matchup with No. 21 
Rutgers, the offense was already 
working hard.

In one possession, sophomore 

guard Siera Thompson missed 
two 3-pointers, senior forward 
Cyesha 
Goree 
grabbed 
two 

offensive rebounds but missed a 
put-back shot and senior guard 
Shannon Smith had to swoop in 
for a quick board and layup to 
prevent a complete disaster.

The early troubles were just 

a sign of things to come for a 
struggling 
Wolverine 
offense 

— despite grabbing 19 offensive 
rebounds, Michigan shot just 26 
percent from the floor, including 
an abysmal 12 percent (3-for-25) 
from beyond the arc.

“It was really a different kind 

of night for us,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “I don’t 
know if it was their pressure 
that affected us so early that 
got us to miss late, but we had 
opportunities.”

Goree, the Wolverines’ leading 

scorer and most commanding 
post presence, spent most of the 
second half on the bench with 
four fouls, forcing Michigan to 

turn to its outside game to find 
an edge. Unfortunately for the 
Wolverines, their shooters just 
couldn’t deliver.

Michigan shot 0-for-10 from 

beyond the arc in the first half 
and missed five more 3s to start 
the second before Smith finally 
knocked one down with 10:44 
remaining in the game.

Both 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

talented 
long-range 
shooters 

had uncharacteristically poor 
days. Thompson missed her first 
nine triples and finished 2-for-13 
from behind the arc and 4-for-
20 from the floor. Freshman 
guard Katelynn Flaherty fared 
even worse coming off the 
bench, missing all seven of her 
3-point attempts and shooting 
just 1-for-11 in total — her worst 
performance since a 1-for-11 
showing against Notre Dame on 
Dec. 13.

“I think that in the first half, 

we took quick shots, and we 
took shots where we felt a lot 
of pressure. With that, I wasn’t 
surprised that we shot poorly,” 
Barnes Arico said. “In the second 
half, I thought we had open looks 
that we missed, uncontested 
shots. We still weren’t able to 
relax.

“I rebound for Siera every 

gameday, and I rebounded for her 

today, and she pretty much makes 
nine out of 10. For her to go and 
shoot (like that) is a shock to me, 
and I think it’s uncharacteristic 
for her.”

But despite the offensive 

cold streak, Michigan remained 
within striking distance of the 
Scarlet Knights throughout the 
game. The Wolverines used a 
zone scheme to hold Rutgers 
to 38 percent shooting in the 
first half, and Smith used a late 
offensive surge to cut the deficit 
to 49-47 with four minutes 
remaining.

But yet again, the offense 

failed to bail Michigan out. 
Thompson and junior guard 
Madison Ristovski missed two 
consecutive open 3-pointers, and 
Thompson and Flaherty failed to 
connect on two more attempts 
within the final minute to seal 
the Wolverines’ fate.

“When we (hit those shots) 

against Ohio State, we won the 
game,” Barnes Arico said. “I 
think it’s probably really crucial, 
especially to the mindset of the 
Rutgers kids, and probably ours 
as well. We had two good looks 
and missed two more shots. But 
we were right there, and next 
time we’ve got to make plays, 
and that’s kind of what we talked 
about.”

Wolverines leave 
their mark in finale

Michigan routs 
MSU behind six 

pool records

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

Breaking records is contagious 

— Just ask the Michigan men’s 
swimming and diving team. 
Saturday, the Wolverines broke 
six pool records, two of which 
had lasted for over a decade.

No. 5 Michigan (6-0 Big Ten, 

10-0 overall) made the trip up 
I-96 to face off with Michigan 
State (0-4 Big Ten, 4-6 overall) 
in East Lansing this weekend. 
The Wolverines won 15 of the 16 
events, dominating their in-state 
rival in both the lap pool and the 
diving well by a score of 178-106.

Junior Dylan Bosch led the way, 

winning the 200-yard butterfly, 
while setting a pool record. The 
record, which was set by former 
Michigan swimmer and Olympic 
gold medalist Tom Malchow, had 
been in place since 1997.

“To break someone’s record 

who is an Olympic gold medalist 
and world record holder, it’s kind 
of a humbling experience,” Bosch 
said. “And it’s an honor at the 
same time.”

Added Michigan coach Mike 

Bottom: 
“To 
the 
swimming 

world, Malchow is an icon, 
and I know it was a record that 
(Bosch) felt very honored to 
break. Breaking records is always 
something that we feel strongly 
about, because we feel that 
Michigan itself belongs on the 
walls of Michigan State.

“Those records are something 

we want to leave behind not 
only for individuals, but for 
Michigan.”

Another 
highlight 
of 
the 

meet came in the diving well, 
where Michigan has struggled 

throughout the season. In the 
last regular season meet of his 
career, fifth-year senior Thomas 
Jahnke took first in both of his 
events, the 1-meter and 3-meter 
springboards.

In most meets, the diving 

competition and the swim races 
occur 
simultaneously. 
This 

weekend’s meet was structured 
differently, placing the diving 
events during the swimmers’ 
breaks, allowing everyone to 
come watch what was going on at 
the other end of McCaffree Pool.

“It put pressure on us to 

perform a little bit better, but it’s 
nice to see them all there and to 
show them that you’re pulling 
the weight too,” Jahnke said. 
“Everyone is contributing for 
the team. It was cool to see them 
there and to dive a little bit better 
with more sense of urgency.

“This year has been pretty 

up and down. In the last two 
meets, with the ways those went, 
it didn’t feel like we had a lot of 
momentum, even though we are 
going into the championship 
season. It felt great to have a good 
meet.”

Jahnke’s recent success came 

at the perfect time, since the 
next event for Michigan is the 
Big Ten Championships. Despite 
the pressure, Jahnke knows he 
has some positive momentum 
leading into the meet.

While Jahnke completed his 

job in the diving end, Michigan 
set records in four of the relays: 
the 
800-yard 
freestyle, 
the 

200-yard medley, the 400-yard 
freestyle 
and 
the 
400-yard 

medley.

Though 
the 
season-ending 

meet did not pose much of a 
challenge for the Wolverines, 
the meet gave them a chance to 
perfect details looking ahead to 
the Big Ten Championships. The 
team knows well that the bigger 
challenge lies ahead.

MEN’S SWIMMING AND DIVING
Wolverine upset bid falls short 

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

With 4:19 to go, Shannon 

Smith 
tumbled 
into 
a 

photographer after making a 
fast-break layup, pulling the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team 
within 
two points 
of 
No. 

21 Rutgers. The senior guard 
scored six consecutive points 
for the Wolverines in the final 
minutes, changing the pace of 
the game and breathing life into 
what had been largely a clumsy 
game. But it wasn’t enough, as 
the Scarlet Knights held on, 
57-50, at Crisler Center.

Though Smith had 19 points 

and eight rebounds, it wasn’t 
enough without senior forward 
Cyesha Goree.

With 14:13 to go in the second 

half, Goree — the Wolverines’ 
leading scorer — committed 
her fourth foul. Because Goree 
was in danger of fouling out, 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico had to take her out in the 
most decisive minutes of the 
game.

And with three starters taller 

than six feet, the Scarlet Knights 
had a clear size advantage 
without the 6-foot-3 Goree on 
the court, allowing Rutgers to 
pull down 29 defensive boards.

“It made our team much 

smaller, so from an offensive 
rebounding standpoint, they got 
a couple on the weakside boards 
that if Cyesha was in there, I 
don’t think they would have 
got,” Barnes Arico said. “We 
were almost playing with five 
guards, and we lost our inside 
presence that Cyesha tried to 
establish early.”

The entire first half, Rutgers 

and Michigan played a back-
and-forth game with neither 
team emerging as a clear leader.

But that quickly changed in 

the second half. The Scarlet 
Knights went on a 6-0 run 

halfway through the second 
frame, and Michigan (6-6 Big 
Ten, 14-9 overall) missed nine 
consecutive field-goal attempts. 
This run ultimately decided the 
game, allowing Rutgers to jump 
out to a 39-27 lead.

But for a team that shot just 26 

percent on the night, its defense 
was what truly allowed for any 
chance of late-game heroics.

When 
the 
Wolverines 

played the Scarlet Knights in 
early January, they racked up 
81 points. Sunday, Michigan 
utilized a zone defense that held 
Rutgers to just 57. The strong 
defensive play should have given 
the Wolverines an early leg up, 
but Michigan’s poor shooting 
left it with a 24-21 deficit at the 
break.

“We had some great open 

looks down the stretch but 
just couldn’t get them to fall,” 
Barnes Arico said. “I don’t know 
if it’s the accumulation of the 
amount of games we’ve had in a 
short turnaround, or if it’s due to 
a little bit of Rutgers’ pressure — 

probably a combination of both 
of those things.”

In Rutgers’ first victory over 

Michigan, the only thing that 
kept the Wolverines in the game 
was Barnes Arico’s halftime 
decision to play zone defense. 
Michigan played zone once 
again on Sunday, hoping for a 
better outcome.

“I think we did a really good 

job of executing our defensive 
game plan,” said senior forward 
Nicole Elmblad. “We knew they 
were a team that wasn’t looking 
to take outside shots, so we kind 
of forced them to do that.”

For the first five minutes, 

Michigan seemed primed to 
pull off the upset.

Goree ran circles around 

Rutgers in the first half and 
grabbed seven rebounds. Before 
she was put on the bench in 
the second to prevent her 
from fouling out, she was a 
major force on the glass, both 
offensively and defensively.

Without 
Goree 
on 
the 

court, the Wolverines needed 

someone to pick up the slack, 
but that relief didn’t come 
from freshman guard Katelynn 
Flaherty. She was held to just 
four points when she played at 
Rutgers earlier this season, and 
the trend continued Sunday, 
with Flaherty shooting just 
1-for-11.

“Rutgers 
has 
a 
player 

named Syessence Davis, who’s 
arguably and probably will be 
(the Big Ten) Defensive Player 
of the Year,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She’s probably one of the best 
guard defenders in the country. 
… I’m sure the matchup there is 
extremely difficult. Katelynn’s 
just trying to figure it all out as a 
freshman and is being guarded 
by one of the best players in the 
country.”

In a game that was close until 

the end, Michigan squandered 
too many open shots to win.

“Sometimes the ball doesn’t 

go in the basket,” Elmblad said. 
“There’s really nothing you can 
do except get back in the gym 
and keep working on it.”

Michigan kicks off season 
with 3-1 record in Florida

Wolverines lose to 
top-ranked Gators, 

win next three

By TYLER SCOTT

Daily Sports Writer

A 62-game season means 

that in college softball, losses 
can’t be dwelt upon. The No. 8 
Michigan softball team looked 
past the game it dropped against 
No. 1 Florida and compiled three 
consecutive wins to end its first 
regular-season series of 2015.

The Wolverines lost 2-1 to the 

Gators on Saturday in the USF 
Classic in Tampa, Florida, and 
then beat host South Florida 
in the nightcap. On Sunday, 
the 
Wolverines 
were 
more 

dominant, 
beating 
Hampton 

and Illinois State with ease.

Saturday’s loss to the Gators 

came in uncharacteristic fashion 
against the defending national 
champions. Florida’s winning 
run came as the result of a wild 
pitch from Michigan senior left-
hander Haylie Wagner.

Wagner, who surrendered 

just two hits in 6 2/3 innings 
of work, put together a strong 
outing that was simply marred 
by an untimely mistake.

“I was just sticking to the 

same game plan,” Wagner said. 
“After (the wild pitch) I knew I 
would sulk on it for five minutes, 
then I had to be ready for the 
next situation I’m in.”

The only previous instance 

when the Gators scored came 
in the form of a single run in 
the fourth inning. Michigan 
was scoreless until sophomore 
outfielder 
Kelly 
Christner 

batted in the tying run by lacing 
a double to right-center field.

With the game tied, Wagner 

issued back-to-back walks to 
start the bottom of the seventh 
inning. A subsequent sacrifice 
bunt and ground out put the 
winning run at third with 
only one out. Florida then hit a 
three-run home run, which was 

negated by a illegal substitution, 
giving the Wolverines another 
chance.

“(The Gators) didn’t re-enter 

a kid on offense, and one of 
our coaching staff noticed it,” 
said Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins. “She 
hit the home 
run, then we 
brought it up 
to the umpire 
who confirmed 
that (Florida’s 
coach) 
didn’t 

re-enter her, so 
it was an illegal substitution.”

But the third and final out 

was never recorded. Wagner’s 
next pitch was too high for the 
catcher, and allowed Florida’s 
runner to score from third, 
dashing any hopes for extra 
innings or a Michigan comeback 
in the marquee matchup of the 
weekend.

“Turns out it didn’t matter, 

because the next pitch was wild 
and they won the game,” said 
Hutchins.

Saturday marked the second 

consecutive 
year 
Florida 

defeated the Wolverines at 
the same USF tournament. 
Last 
February, 
the 
Gators 

were able execute a comeback 
performance in extra-innings.

Minus 
the 
wild 
pitch, 

Wagner 
was 
every 
bit 
as 

effective as Florida freshman 
pitcher Aleshia Ocasio, who 
limited Michigan to just one 
run and two hits through a full 
seven innings of work. Aside 
from Christner, freshmen first-
baseman Tera Blanco recorded 
the only other Michigan hit.

After 
being 
stymied 
by 

Florida, Michigan beat each of 
its next three opponents in USF, 
Hampton and Illinois State 
by scores of 4-3, 9-2 and 4-1, 
respectively.

Senior 
right-hander 
Sara 

Driesenga was consistent with 
her superb work in the circle 
over the weekend. She notched 
wins against both South Florida 

and Illinois State, allowing just 
one earned run in the process.

“You 
just 
have 
to 
stay 

confident,” Driesenga said. “I go 
out there and keep pitching how 
I know I can pitch.”

Sophomore 

right-hander 
Megan Betsa 
pitched 
the 

win 
Sunday 

morning 
against 
Hampton, 
allowing one 
earned run on 
a hit and five 

walks.

Against USF, the Wolverines 

finally 
found 
some 
offense 

in long-ball fashion. Junior 
outfielder Kelsey Susalla and 
Christner hit back-to-back solo 
home runs.

Junior 
shortstop 
Sierra 

Romero also recorded her first 
home-run of the year in the 
game against Hampton, where 
she was 3-4 at the plate and had 
four RBI.

Since 
her 
All-American 

season last year, Romero has had 
to adjust with the willingness of 
opposing teams to walk her in 
order to keep her bat cool.

“It’s not frustrating (to be 

walked),” Romero said. “Yeah 
I want to hit, but I know that 
taking my walk is as good as a 
single.”

Despite picking up three wins 

on the weekend, Hutchins was 
not entirely satisfied with how 
her team looked on the field.

“I 
thought 
we 
played 

tentative,” 
Hutchins 
said. 

“I don’t think we came out 
attacking.”

According 
to 
Hutchins, 

there’s plenty of room for 
improvement that picking up 
wins early on has the tendency 
to hide.

“The 
biggest 
problem 
is 

when you win, it doesn’t sting 
as much,” Hutchins said. “We 
have to make improvements, 
otherwise we’re going to lose 
some games.”

Conditions threaten to 
cancel Soldier Field game

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

CHICAGO — Window by 

window, the skyscrapers north 
of Soldier Field grew darker as 
the game went on, blending into 
the night sky as Saturday night 
turned into Sunday morning.

On the ice, the puck could be 

seen bouncing over sticks and 
along the boards while play-
ers slipped and slid all over the 
rink. Saturday’s game between 
No. 14 Michigan and rival Michi-
gan State began hours later than 
planned, and never fully was a 
clean game.

But as Drew Russell — the Vice 

President of Properties at Inter-
Sport in charge of operations at 
the Hockey City Classic — looked 
on at the play below, he knew that 
simply getting a game in meant 
mission accomplished.

At the tail end of one of Chica-

go’s more erratic weather weeks, 
Russell and his team came dan-
gerously close to having to cancel 
the event.

“Everybody wanted to get the 

game in tonight,” Russell said. 
“Officials, coaches, players, fans, 
no one wanted to extend this pro-
cess or put a contingency plan in 
place.”

With snow, negative tempera-

tures and a sudden heat wave all 
coming just days apart, InterS-
port — the company in charge of 
running the event — had its work 
cut out for the event Saturday 
morning. When a compressor 
below the ice became faulty, the 
possibility of a game occurring 
was quite literally on thin ice.

“There was in my mind,” said 

Michigan coach Red Berenson 
on the possibility of a cancella-
tion. “When we got a call that the 
game was being pushed back, we 
weren’t sure what was going to 
happen.”

Amazingly, the warm ice was 

the least of mother nature’s evils. 
The mild temperatures had melt-
ed the ice, giving Russell’s team 
an opportunity to reset a rink 
that had already been ravaged by 
the elements.

“Sometimes it’s too cold or 

there’s too much for the ice, so it 
gets brittle and hard to maintain,” 
Russell said Saturday. “The warm 
weather actually helped us get 
into good position for today. We 
brought the ice temperatures back 
up, we got it to where it was good, 
but we had to work with it and had 
to get everything back into a stable 
position and that just took a little 
longer than we anticipated.”

Added Michigan State coach 

Tom Anastos: “I will tell you, 
after last night, I didn’t think 
there was much chance or hope 
we would have this today. They 
really did a good job getting the 
ice into the condition that they 
were so we could play, it came a 
long way from last night.”

Before 
the 
ice 
regained 

strength, though, things looked 
rather bleak for the event. With 
teams cancelling morning skates 
and the beating sun continuing 
to melt the ice, Russell began 
looking into alternative options. 
With Disney on Ice and Monster 
Jam occupying nearby ice arenas, 
the United Center and Allstate 
Arena, respectively, Russell had 
one indoor locale identified: the 
1,500-seat McFetridge Sports 
Center run by the Chicago Park 
District.

“In our business, we try to 

prepare for the worst and react 
when the worst occurs,” Russell 
said. “There were external forces 
we were up against here like the 
weather and the curfew we have 
here in Chicago, so that went into 
our thinking. The biggest thing 
was the ice, and fortunately, the 
ice kept getting better as the day 
wore on, and I think everybody’s 
going to go away pleased.”

With the hours ticking and an 

entire game to be played before 
the Spartans and Wolverines hit 
the ice, the two teams waited in 
limbo to see if they would play 
Saturday. With both teams play-
ing under the same elements, the 
edge was going to have to come 
from elsewhere.

“We talked about it all week 

that when you go into this cir-
cumstance, you don’t know what 
to expect,” Anastos said. “It’s 
more than physical with just one 
game, it about being mentally 
ready to play for whatever comes; 
rain, snow, wind, cold, delays, 
cancellations, whatever.”

By around 4:30 p.m., a setting 

sun and reactivated compressor 
brought hope of a game back to 
both teams. But by the time the 
puck was dropped at 8:41 p.m., it 
was clear the conditions were far 
from perfect.

“Not great,” said Michigan 

sophomore 
goaltender 
Zach 

Nagelvoort Saturday of the day’s 
conditions. “Today was a ton bet-
ter compared to yesterday. Obvi-
ously looking at the ice, it’s the 
same ice for both teams, so say 
what you want about it, but every-
one is going to have to play on it.”

As the rest of the city went 

to bed, the two rivals battled it 
out on the ice. Michigan used a 
flurry of short passes and long-
range shots from defensemen 
to pull out the 4-1 win, but the 
mere occurrence of the event was 
enough to make everyone happy.

“Constant 
communication 

with the facilities here, constant 
communication with the ice 
crew, the official and the teams, 
we all knew we were going to do 
everything in our power to get 
it in,” said Russell, whose team 
has now executed three outdoor 
hockey events. “We feel that our 
product on the ice was really 
great, and everyone went home 
pleased.”

‘M’ tops MSU outdoors

Defense carries 
Wolverines to win 

at Soldier Field

By JEREMY SUMMITT

Daily Sports Editor

CHICAGO — As the team 

with the nation’s top offense, 
Michigan’s 
defensive 
corps 

seldom steals the spotlight.

But that 

was 
the 

case in the 
Coyote 
Logistics Hockey City Classic 
at Soldier Field on Saturday, 
as 
goals 
from 
sophomore 

defenseman Michael Downing 
and 
freshman 
defenseman 

Cutler 
Martin 
paced 
the 

Wolverines to a 4-1 victory over 
Michigan 
State. 
Sophomore 

goaltender 
Zach 
Nagelvoort 

made 31 saves in the win, which 
helped keep Michigan atop the 
Big Ten standings.

“I thought our forecheck was 

better, our ‘D’ zone was better, 
our neutral zone was better and 
I thought our second effort was 
better,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “We had more second 
effort, more physicality and we 
were more invested in the game 
than we were last week.”

Despite 
unfavorable 
ice 

conditions that resulted in nearly 
a two-hour delay, the Wolverines 
(8-2 Big Ten, 16-8 overall) came 
out of the gates with a sense 
of urgency. Downing netted 
his fifth goal of the season just 
1:43 into the game off a feed 
from freshman forward Tyler 
Calderone.

“It was really important for us 

to not let them get into their trap, 
their neutral zone which is really 
good defensively,” said junior 
forward Andrew Copp. “Scoring 
the first goal was important to 
us.”

Michigan would go on to 

score three unanswered goals 
by the end of the second period. 

Martin, an East Lansing native 
who opted for a hockey career in 
Ann Arbor, added a tally of his 
own with 6:44 left in the second 
period. A failed clearance ended 
up in Martin’s glove before he 
dropped the puck to his stick 
and fired a shot from the high 
slot that beat goaltender Jake 
Hildebrand on his blocker side.

Michigan’s defensemen have 

netted 12 total goals this season, 
a mark that has already doubled 
last year’s total. Even on nights 
when the Wolverines’ plethora 
of scoring threats up front don’t 
find twine, reinforcements are 
typically looming on the blue line.

Even more impressive was 

the stout defensive play for a 
team that ranks in the lower half 
of the nation in team defense. 
Michigan concedes an average 
of 2.96 goals per game and 
continues to rely on its offensive 
aptitude to make up for its 
inconsistencies on the defensive 
end. Saturday marked a break 
from a season-long tradition, 
but it stands as a break that 
Michigan will gladly accept.

“I think we kept the game a lot 

simpler than we did last game,” 
Martin said. “We really tried to 
play more defense tonight and 
focused on that, even though a 
couple of us had a few goals here 
and there, but I think that was a 
result of playing good defense.”

The Spartans (4-4-2, 10-12-2) 

did begin to mount a comeback 
after the second intermission, 

but not before Copp was able 
to extend the lead to three by 
jamming one home late in the 
second period.

Michigan State would finally 

strike twine five minutes into 
the final period when Spartan 
forward Matt Deblouw found 
the puck in the middle of a scrum 
and slipped one past Nagelvoort.

Still, Nagelvoort’s successes 

outweighed his lone error.

“I thought (Nagelvoort) was 

smart with the puck, outside 
of the one rebound which 
they scored, on a loose puck,” 
Berenson said. “He covered up 
everything around the net. It 
was hard because the puck was 
bouncing.”

Though Berenson has needed 

to sift through a season-long 
goaltending 
competition, 

Nagelvoort has started the last 
three games and has conceded 
just 
three 
goals. 
He 
says 

Nagelvoort is “in a good place” 
right now.

It was a successful stay in 

the Windy City for the guys in 
front of him, too. Junior forward 
Justin Selman’s empty-net goal 
with 1:12 left in the game put the 
seal on another chapter of one 
of college hockey’s most historic 
rivalries. And in 302 meetings, 
the 
bitterness 
between 
the 

schools hasn’t faded.

“We could go fishing and 

it would be the same,” said 
Michigan 
State 
coach 
Tom 

Anastos.

Transition offense 
lifts ‘M’ to first win

By SHAWN HEROOR

Daily Sports Writer

Trailing Bellarmine 7-5 at the 

half, Michigan men’s lacrosse 
coach 
John 
Paul 
had 
one 

message 
for 
his 

team: stick 
with the script.

The Wolverines were able 

to do just that, outscoring 
Bellarmine 7-1 in the third 
quarter en route to a 16-9 victory 
in their season opener. The 
offensive barrage included a 5-0 
run with all five goals scored 
within four minutes of each 
other.

“We want to play a lot faster 

this year, but we just weren’t 
converting on our opportunities 
in the first half,” Paul said. “In 
the second half, we didn’t need 
to make adjustments, we just 
capitalized on our chances.”

Michigan (1-0) was paced 

by 
senior 
attacker 
David 

McCormack, 
who 
tallied 

a 
career-high 
four 
goals. 

Sophomore 
midfielder 
Mikie 

Schlosser also added four tallies, 
while junior midfielder Kyle 
Jackson chipped in with a pair 
of goals and an assist.

Both teams came out firing in 

the first quarter, with Schlosser 
scoring twice to give Michigan 
the early 2-1 lead. The Knights 
(0-1) responded with a 7-3 run, 
sending them into the half with 
a two-goal advantage.

“There’s always a little pre-

game jitters, especially coming 
into the first game of the season,” 
Schlosser said. “We started a 
little slow, we didn’t defend well 
in transition.”

Michigan responded quickly 

in the third for its sixth goal, 
with senior midfielder Thomas 
Orr and sophomore attacker Ian 
King combining with a give-and-
go off a transition opportunity, 
ending with Orr burying a goal 
past Bellarmine goalie Drew 
Goethals. McCormack tied the 
game just two minutes later with 
another transition goal, taking a 

feed from sophomore midfielder 
Peter Khoury and notching his 
first of the afternoon.

“We’ve preached it all year 

long, playing the game fast,” 
Schlosser said. “In the third, we 
played the way we need to all 
season.”

Michigan 
continued 
the 

onslaught 
with 
three 
goals 

in under a minute. Redshirt 
junior David Joseph beat a pair 
of Bellarmine defenders and 
put one past Goethal’s to put 
the Wolverines ahead. On the 
ensuing faceoff, junior faceoff 
man Brad Lott found fellow 
junior midfielder Dan Kinek, 
who ripped another into the net, 
extending the lead to 9-7. Lott 
won the next faceoff as well, and 
Schlosser got his hat trick with 
8:46 left in the third, cushioning 
the Wolverines’ advantage.

Bellarmine got a goal back 

with 2:43 left in the quarter, 
but 
McCormack 
responded 

quickly to restore the three-
goal lead. Then, Jackson put the 
Wolverines up four with just 
two seconds remaining in the 
third, spinning around a Knight 
defender and beating the clock to 
give Michigan a 12-8 advantage 
heading into the final stanza.

“We saw their heads dropping 

after we went on that run,” 
McCormack said. “We knew 
that was the time to pounce on 
them and close it out.”

McCormack did just that at 

the start of the fourth, scoring 
a spectacular goal to put the 
game out of reach. After beating 
a Bellarmine defender behind 
the net, McCormack wrapped 
around and netted a diving 
goal past Goethals to give the 
Wolverines a five-goal lead.

Redshirt sophomore goalie 

Gerald Logan, playing in his first 
game in two years, got the win 
for Michigan with 12 saves. 

Michigan will temper its 

expectations after just one win, 
but with the offensive outburst, 
a breakout season may lie ahead 
with the Wolverines’ new attack 
style.

Wolverines win two weekend duals

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

To 
paraphrase 
Charles 

Dickens, 
“It 
was 
best 
of 

weekends. It was the worst 
of weekends,” for the No. 16 
Michigan wrestling team.

Friday, the Wolverines (4-4 

Big Ten, 6-5 overall) faced a 
formidable opponent in No. 10 
Nebraska (8-1, 11-1), which was 
riding a five-meet winning streak. 
The Cornhuskers lived up to their 
billing as they bested Michigan, 
23-10, at Cliff Keen Arena.

“(Nebraska) 
is 
a 
scrappy 

team,” said Michigan coach Joe 
McFarland. “We got out hustled 
a couple of times.”

But the Wolverines had no time 

to feel sorry for themselves as they 
were set to travel to No. 22 Purdue 
(1-6, 8-8) on Sunday. Michigan left 
the bad taste from Friday night 
back in Ann Arbor and defeated 
the Boilermakers, 26-9.

“I told the guys we have to 

take out our frustrations on 
(Purdue),” 
McFarland 
said. 

“That is what championship 
teams do.”

Friday’s meet got off to 

a 
promising 
start 
for 
the 

Wolverines 
as 
redshirt 

sophomore Conor Youtsey shut 
out Nebraska’s Tim Lambert, 
4-0, avenging a defeat from 
earlier this season. The result 
was a formidable victory as 
Lambert is the No. 10 wrestler 

in the nation in the 125-pound 
weight class.

“It’s good to get revenge,” 

Youtsey said. “I just knew that 
I had to keep scoring and keep 
attacking.”

But the Cornhuskers began 

to take control in the 133-
pound 
class. 
With 
redshirt 

sophomore Rossi Bruno out 
with an injury, fifth-year senior 
Zebulon Hilyard was summoned 
to compete against Nebraska’s 
Eric 
Montoya. 
Hilyard 
had 

started only once in a dual meet 
before 
Friday 
and 
Montoya 

took advantage of Hilyard’s 
inexperience, dominating the 
match, 11-3.

After another defeat in the 

141-pound class, No. 13 freshman 
Alec 
Pantaleo 
provided 

Michigan with a ray of hope in 
the 149-pound class. Pantaleo 
scored five takedowns, three of 
them in the first period, en route 
to a convincing win, 11-1. The 
resulting major decision evened 
the score at 7-7.

“My coaches kept telling me, 

‘Don’t worry about anything 
else. Just keep scoring points.’ ” 
Pantaleo said. “They’re the most 
mentally tough people I’ve ever 
met.”

But it was all Cornhuskers 

after that. No. 11 sophomore 
Brian Murphy participated in a 
hard-fought match with No. 4 
James Green in the 157-pound 
weight class. The contest was 

tight throughout, but Green 
built up a one-minute riding 
time advantage. That and a late 
takedown propelled Green to a 
4-2 victory and gave Nebraska 
the lead for good. Murphy’s 
match was the first of five in a 
row that Michigan dropped.

“The match really changed 

when 
(Green) 
got 
exactly 

one minute of riding time,” 
McFarland said. “That meant 
(Murphy) had to chase him 
down the rest of the match.”

A late lineup change in the 

165-pound class put freshman 
Garrett Sutton in his first 
collegiate dual bout, replacing 
injured 
redshirt 
sophomore 

Taylor Massa. While he showed 
some fight, Nebraska’s Austin 
Wilson proved too much as 
Sutton lost, 8-3.

No. 8 fifth-year senior Max 

Huntley 
suffered 
the 
most 

agonizing loss in the 197-pound 
weight class as he squandered 
a lead to send his bout with 
Aaron Studebaker into overtime. 
Studebaker 
then 
scored 
a 

takedown in the overtime period 
to take the match, 6-4.

“(Huntley) 
had 
a 
lot 
of 

opportunities 
to 
win 
that 

match,” McFarland said. “It 
came down to a lot of technical 
things. You can’t afford to let 
that happen.”

Sunday’s 
meet 
against 

Purdue got off to a similar 
start to Friday’s contest as the 

Wolverines went 2-2 in the first 
four bouts. 

But that is where the parallels 

between the two meets end. In 
the 157-pound class, Murphy 
provided a huge momentum 
swing for Michigan by pinning 
No. 10 Doug Welch 4:56 into 
the match. It was Murphy’s 
first collegiate pin, and it put 
the Wolverines on top of the 
Boilermakers, 13-6, at halftime.

“I just needed to relax and 

wrestle loose,” Murphy said.

A 3-2 loss by Sutton in the 

165-pound weight class was 
Michigan’s only blemish the 
rest of the way. The Wolverines 
came out on top in the final four 
bouts, which included shoutout 
victories by sophomore Domenic 
Abounader (4-0) and Huntley 
(8-0 major decision) in the 184 
and 197-pound weight classes, 
respectively.

The Wolverines will continue 

to rely on their replacements 
as the injury list continues to 
grow. In addition to Massa and 
Bruno being sidelined, freshman 
Davonte Mahomes is out for 
the remainder of the 2014-15 
season with an anterior cruciate 
ligament tear and fifth-year 
senior Steve Dutton left the team 
because of concussions.

But just like this weekend, the 

Wolverines will not spend time 
feeling sorry for themselves with 
three more duals and Big Ten 
Championships looming.
