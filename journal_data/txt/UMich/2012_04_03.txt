LEGAL DISPUTE
GSRA ban
will not be
i iate

Regents vote to
support court
ruling
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
The University's Board of
Regents public quarrel over
whether graduate student
research assistants should be
able to legally unionize contin-
ued yesterday in a hastily sched-
uled special meeting.
The regents voted 5-3 in
favor of the University writing
an amicus brief to an Ingham
County Court decision regarding
unionization of GSRAs. Specifi-
cally, the court found that Mich-
igan House Republicans did not
follow correct protocol when
voting last month on immedi-
ate effect of a bill that formally
declared that GSRAs are not
state employees.
Senate Bill 971 was passed
with immediate effect, barring
GSRAs from unionizing. With-

out immediate effect, the bill
will go into action 90 days after
the last of day of the Michigan
legislative calendar, which is
scheduled to be March 2013.
The regents' meeting was
called on Saturday, but the court
hearing was held yesterday, just
hours before the special meeting
began.
After only about 10 minutes
of discussion, the regents voted
along party lines with Olivia
Maynard (D-Goodrich) as the
only Democrat to oppose the
motion.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman declined to offer
her opinion on the issue. How-
ever, Coleman has previously
said that she along with other
top University administrators,
believes that GSRAs are students
not employees with collective
bargaining rights.
"I'm not going to comment on
this particular decision," Cole-
man said "I think this is some-
thing the board needs to decide."
Still Coleman said that filing

COLD AS ICE CENTRAL STUDENT GOVERNMENT
After CSJ hearing, the
CSG election continues

Student Judiciary
remands case back
to UEC
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
The saga continues.
After the four parties and
one independent running
for Central Student Govern-
ment president endured vari-
ous complaints that led to the
longest-known hearing in the
history of University Elec-
tions Commission - ultimately
delaying election results by 11

hours - the Central Student
Judiciary held its own hearing
last night.
Ending a nearly six-hour
hearing until about 1 a.m. today,
the Central Student Judiciary
voted to remand an appeal of a
hearing held by the UEC against
Business junior Manish Parikh,
the unofficial winner of the CSG
presidential elections, back to
the UEC. However, even after
the UEC addresses the case
again, it could be appealed an
additional time, and CSG offi-
cials say they are unsure when
the case will end.
In the original hearing,
which lasted a total of 12 hours,

the UEC ruled in a 3-2 vote that
e-mail violations by Parikh only
garnered four demerits,because
of various mitigating factors.
Parikh originally faced more
than 1,000 demerits - only five
are needed to disqualify a can-
didate from the election.
CSJ found that only two of
the 11 mitigating factors that
the UEC decided the case on
still stand. The UEC will now
review the hearing on these two
factors.
Law student Ryan Gerso-
vitz, the CSJ chief justice, was
unable to give a definite date for
the end of the hearings.

'U' students help war effort

70 years ago this week (April
2,1942): The residents of Mosher-
Jordan Residence Hall financially
adopted 4-year-old English twins
through the American Save the
Children Federation, following a
similar effort to support the war
by residents of nearby Stockwell
Hall, the Michigan Daily reported.
Residents donated $120 for each
child - which would be matched
by the British government - to
provide food and shelter for the
orphans of war.
Along with 28 other orphans,
the twins were housed in an Eng-
lish nursery in Cornwall aptly
named the "Ann Arbor Shelter," in
honor of the students and commu-
nity members who helped support
them.

50 years ago this week (April
3, 1962): Lewis Hyman, a Michi-
gan gymnast, remained uncon-
scious and in serious condition
after falling off a trampoline dur-
ing the NCAA championship in
New Mexico, the Daily reported.
Following the accident, Hyman
endured four hours of brain sur-
gery to alleviate hemorrhaging.
The incident occurred during
the final trick of his routine, which
he had performed successfully the
night before. According to specta-
tors, Hyman spun so rapidly that
he was unable to catch himself
with his free hand.
This incident was the first of its
kind for the varsity gymnastics
program at the University, accord-
ing to the Daily.

30 years ago this week (April
2, 1982): Hash Bash experienced
its smallest turnout to date,
according to Ann Arbor police
officers who patrolled the Diag
and surrounding areas, the Daily
reported.
Despite the minimal turn-
out, 12 people were arrested for
possession of marijuana, one of
which decided to evade police
and instigate a 200-yard pursuit
across South State Street.
Students interviewed by the
Daily deemed Hash Bash as more
of a "70s thing" and were not
excited by the population of older
non-students who congregated on r
the Diag. FILE PHOTO/Dail

From Page1
perfect opportunity for me to get
involved. I'm just excited to be
a part of a movement that helps
(Obama) get re-elected in Novem-
ber."
LSA freshman Ari Cicurel said
he decided to attend the session to
increase his political involvement
after being inspired by the Young
Americans for Obama's Greater
Together Student Summit Tour,
which stopped at the University
earlier this month and featured
an address by actor Kal Penn and
Stephanie Cutter, Obama's deputy
campaign manager. Cicurel will
vote in his first presidential elec-
tion this year, and said now is the
opportune time to make his mark.
"I'm very interested in politics
and getting involved in the cam-
paign," Cicurel said. "This is my
first election that I am able to vote
in, so I am really excited about
being able to vote but also being
involved and being able to express
my opinion and what I'm voting
for."
LSA sophomore Stefanie
Rubinstein, member of the Uni-
versity Career Center's Public Ser-
vice Intern Program, said the OFA
field organizer training sounded
appealing because of her growing
interest in campaigning during a
high stakes presidential election.
"Over the past year, I've real-
ized the importance of this cam-
paign and making sure that the
president gets reelected," Rubin-
stein said. "It's something that
I am really passionate about, so
when I saw this opportunity, I fig-

ured it would be a fun way to get
involved ... if it leads to something
more, that would be great."
LSA junior Matt Jones, a board
member in the University's chap-
ter of College Republicans and
leader of Students for Romney on
campus, said the Republicans do
not have the same opportunity to
participate in activities like OFA
has because they still don't know
who their party's nominee willbe.
"Volunteerism is just as impor-
tant to us as for Obama's cam-
paign, but ... (Republicans) are
still in the primary phase, so the
further in we get, the more extra
structure we are going to have
(and) more organizing efforts will
start emerging," Jones said.
As a member of the Romney
campaign in Michigan, Jones
plans to distribute posters and
placards on campus and recruit
volunteers to make phone calls to
foster support for the Republican
Party. In the following months,
Jones said he hopes to have
Republican candidates come to
Ann Arbor to strengthen support
among students.
LSA freshman Sarah Myint,
also a member of College Repub-
licans, agreed that the primary
process makes it difficult to cam-
paign for a specific candidate.
"We're just campaigning on
the Republican ideal and what
any Republican candidate really
would offer versus a Democrat
candidate," Myint said. "What we
really want (students to know) is
that it is not about Mitt Romney
or Barack Obama, it's about them
and their country."
LSA freshman Elena Brennan,
the newly elected external vice

chair for College Republicans,
said the group is preparing for
the election by reaching out to a
new set of students.
"We are hoping to get people
that normally (are) not even
political to come to (an) event,"
she said, "We are hoping to tap
into that market here on campus
because I think that's huge, and
I think the majority of students
here on campus are apathetic."
Brennan added that College
Republicans will implement new
campaigning techniques in the
fall to bring a unique perspective
to Republican values, including
working with the College Demo-
crats.
"With our new leadership,
I think that we're looking to
change the dynamic of our group
to make it more open," she said.
"We'd like to collaborate more
with the College Democrats and
with other student organizations
so that we are not just polarized
as this minority conservative
group who no one knows about.
We are planning on doing a vari-
ety of fundraising events so that
they bolster our presence here on
campus."
She further acknowledged the
importance of the next presiden-
tial election and how it will deter-
mine the fate of the nation.
"It's amazing that it is happen-
ing at this moment when we are
the youth, and we can really have
a say in what goes on," Brennan
said. "The Democrats and Repub-
licans are so polarized right now
that I think this election is defi-
nitely the biggest of our lifetime,
and I think it will decide which
way this country goes."

RESEARCH
From Page 1
Forrest claims that though
many factors have contributed
to the University's expand-
ing research network, includ-
ing the breadth of topics being
researched, the primary factor is
the dedicated and innovative fac-
ulty members.
Forrest added that faculty
members and students benefit
significantly from the Universi-
ty's expenditures on a wide vari-
ety of research programs.
"The students get access to
solving problems that are impor-
tant in the real world through
working with the industry and
on teams, and this provides an
incredible educational experi-
ence," Forrest said.
Forrest said various initia-
tives have been implemented
over the past few years to bring
the best programs from the
industrial sector to the Uni-
versity in an effort to benefit
the state's struggling economy.
Among these initiatives is the
business engagement policy,
which Forrest said gives indus-
trial partners additional license
negotiating rights.
Forrest added that he believes
the positive trend will continue
over the next few years and the
research network will continue
to grow.
Engineering Dean David
Munson said the large size and
high quality of the University's
research programs are due to its
ambitious faculty.
"Michigan is both an outstand-

ing teaching university and a
powerhouse research university,"
Munson said. "Much of U-M's
reputation is realized from its
research mission, which culmi-
nates in discovery and creation of
new knowledge."
Munson claimed that the rea-
son Johns Hopkins outranked the
University is because it includes
money from their Applied Phys-
ics Lab, an affiliated defense lab
that is separate from the univer-
sity itself and conducts research
related to homeland security and
space.
Engineering Prof. Jeffrey Fes-
sler said while he believes finan-
cial resources facilitate research
programs that maylead to discov-
ery, they should not be the only
factor when determining quality.
"How much money we get and
spend on research is less impor-
tant than how much knowledge
we create and impact we have on
society," Fessler said.
Kara Gavin, University of
Michigan Health System spokes-
woman, said the University Medi-
cal School currently receives the
sixth-highest funding allocation
from the National Institutes of
Health and ranks second among
medical schools affiliated with
public universities.
Gavin added that the school
has brought hundreds of millions
of dollars into the state in the last
year through funding received
for research from the National
Institutes of Health. Recent data
shows that the total economic
impact on the state is nearly $L2
billion, accordingto Gavin.
LSA freshman Claire Erba par-
ticipated in a biology-related fel-

lowship through the University's
Undergraduate Research Oppor-
tunity Program. Erba said the
experience was an important part
of her first-year experience.
"It was really rewarding to be
able to develop a meaningful con-
nection with an experienced fac-
ulty member as early as freshmen
year," Erba said.
Erba added that the high
ranking does not surprise her
because she believes the Uni-
versity values educating its stu-
dents and conducting research.
These two functions often go
hand-in-hand to allow students
to learn in a more experimental
way, Erba said.
LSA junior Dora Sobze has
participated in approximately
10 University-affiliated research
projects and was a research
assistant in a psychology lab.
"I feel really good about it
because a lot of my professors
will use their own research
findings in their lesson plans.
As a student you know you are
getting cutting-edge educa-
tion," Sobze said. "As a research
participant, I've learned more
about how research is conduct-
ed when deception is involved."
Kinesology sophomore Dani-
elle Sanna said it would be
helpful to inform undergradu-
ates about future research
opportunities available to them
instead of focusing only on
what current graduate students
are doing.
"I feel like the mission of the
University is producing stu-
dents that are going to go out
to the community and do some-
thing positive," Sanna said.

lution directing the Planning
Commission was distinct from
the delayed proposed amendment
to the city code.
"The difference here is the
ordinance is already in place by
law," Taylor said. "Any change
to this or the zoning ordinance
should go to the Planning Com-
mission first and come back with
a recommendation."
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje said council was wasting too
much time on the medical mari-
juana issue because deliberation
in the state Legislature could
change state law in the near
future.
"We've spent way too much
time on this issue," Hieftje said.
"I lay that at the feet of the Leg-
islatures in Lansing because they
have totally dropped the ball and
have failed to provide consis-
tent guidelines for local govern-
ments."
The discussion of the legality
of medical marijuana facilities in
Ann Arbor returns to City Coun-
cil after two Ann Arbor-based
medical marijuana facilities were
raided by regional authorities last
August.

New members of the CSG

CSJ justice Carlos Torres, also
a Law student, noted that CSJ will
do whatever it takes to verify the
elections in an effort to establish
the next ruling student govern-
ment body. Instead the court put a
temporary restraining order, last-
ing 48 hours, on the certification
of the presidential election to give
both CSG and the UEC adequate

the brief and said she does not
believe it is the University's place
to take a position on the issue. She
added that both parties have tradi-
tionally ignored the use of proper
protocol when voting on imme-
diate effect acts.
"We shouldn't be involved in
legislative procedural issues,"
Fischer Newman said. "I don't
think it does us any good to take
sides in a legislative proceeding
that's been used by both Demo-
crats and Republicans over the
the public commentary section of
the City Council meeting and said
Ann Arbor's decision will set an
example for the rest of the state.
"A lot of other municipalities
look to Ann Arbor ... If you can get

be a lot of other local cities that
look to you guys as leaders on this
issue," Driver said.
In an interview during the
meeting's recess, Driver said he
closed his dispensary because he
feared facing criminal action.
Instead, he said he now travels
around the state advocating for
the protection of medical mari-
juana dispensaries.
"I have since voluntarily shut
my doors because I work in Lan-
sing. I come to these things and
I speak. Basically, I'm scared,"
Driver said. "Basically it was
(Michigan Attorney General) Bill
Schuette's personal threats. He
was the lead opposition to the law
before he was attorney general."
Driver said the legality of dis-
pensaries in Michigan has been
unclear from the start, citing his
own personal experience in Gay-
lord as an example.
"They're operating with the
blessing of the city and the coun-
ty but without actual license.
When we all opened, we looked
at the law, we picked apart dif-
ferent parts of the law as to why
it's allowed," Driver said. "It

Newman added that topic of
the meeting should have been
made public prior to the start of
the meeting.
"I also find the circumstance
of this meeting troubling," Fish-
er said. "I understand that the
notice was given, I think that the
topics should be included in the
notices. There is nothing to be
gained from not having public
comment on the issue."
Regent Denise Illitch (D-
says a medical marijuana patient
is allowed to purchase medical
marijuana without fear of arrest,
it doesn't say that he has to do it
from this guy at this time."
Driver said the public hasn't
had a problem with dispensaries
in Ann Arbor or anywhere in the
state.
"There've been absolutely no
complaints. Same in my town,
there've been no complaints,"
Driver said. "That's odd. The
amount of complaints thathappen
from bars and liquor stores are
huge, and there just haven't been
any (with medical marijuana dis-
pensaries)."
Driver said the vague nature of
the Michigan Medical Marihuana
Act has allowed Schuette to crack
down on dispensaries.
"If you look atwhatwe actually
voted on as voters in 2008, it was
half a paragraph," Driver said.
Driver said the inaction hurts
medical marijuana's sickest users
the most.
"We made sure to keep our
phone going. We stayed open for
an additional three months after
we closed. We stayed open to help
people find caregivers. But even
that's about impossible," Driver
said. "The thing is, it really affects
the people that really truly need

Gersovitz said the UEC hopes
to certify the presidential elec-
tions, but the CSG constitution
and compiled code say the presi-
dent must be seated after 10 days.
This could create logistical prob-
lems if this hearing is not resolved
within this time frame.
"The temporary restraining
order allows us to get the time to
write our opinion and the UEC
to hear the opinion again on
remand," Gersovitz said. "We're
worried that if we don't grant this
order that tomorrow the UEC
will certify the election deadlines
and that within 10 days, Parikh
has to be seated."
LSA senior Brendan Campbell,
the CSG vice president, said pre-

maturely certifying the president
would reflect poorly on CSG if the
impending UEC hearing disqual-
ifies the president-elect.
"If a candidate is removed
from the ballot, but has already
been certified as the winner, it
will create serious problems for
the true winner of the election,"
Campbell said.
Election director Peter Borock
said there is a chance that in light
of this remand, the UEC will not
return to hold this hearing.
"This is going to be going for
a while," Borock said. "I don't
want to speak hyperbolically, but
there's a chance that the UEC just
resigns en masse, because they
can't do this anymore."
Borock added: "To be honest,
I don't know if they can do this
anymore. It's taken six weeks out
of everyone's life... (CSG) might
have to find new members (of the
UEC)."

Reject Ryan's budget
Federal budget shouldn't hurt groups of citizens
ast Thursday, a proposed budget plan crafted by U.S. Rep
Paul Ryan (R - Wisc.), chairman of the House Budget Com-
mittee, was approved by the House of Representatives. In
a mostly party line vote, the plan passed 228-191. Though the plan
will likely be voted down by the Democrat-controlled Senate, Ryan's
proposed budget, which empowers the already wealthy, lays out
plans that could hurt lower income citizens. Congress must craft a
federal budget that will be suitable for all economic backgrounds,
and Republicans and Democrats must come to an agreement on the
country's fiscal situation.

Ryan's plan, called "The Path to Pros-
perity: A Blueprint for American Renewal"
largely focuses on spending cuts. It will lower
the discretionary spending cap from $1.047
trillion to $1.028 trillion in the 2013 fiscal
year, basically reducing the amount of debt
our country can have. While this reduction
may seem like a good thing at first glance, it's
important to dig into the details of the plan.
Ryan's budget calls for an end to the Medi-
care guarantee for senior citizens. Current
seniors who have planned and budgeted
their lives around receiving Medicare will
continue to receive the help. However, those
citizens not of senior status will not be grant-
ed the automatic health care. Instead, they
will be given options as they are planning
for retirement, one of which include a "fee-
for-service traditional option within a pre-
mium support system," as stated by Ryan. All
Americans are entitled to Medicare, as they
have dedicated their lives to careers within
our nation. Cutting Medicare may reduce the
budget deficit, but it will come at the cost of
some senior's lives.
The plan calls for six independent adviso-
ry panels that will determine places that the
budget can be cut to reduce the overall defi-
cit. These panels will make cuts respective to

their committee and hopefully, achieve these
lofty goals. But many of the numbers outlined
in the plan could be unattainable, and these
panel members may be pressured to make
harmful cuts. It's important to realize the
benefits and drawbacks of spending cuts. If
the cut has the potential to influence or hurt
thousands of people, it shouldn't be made
under any circumstance.
The "Path to Prosperity" also includes tax
breaks for the wealthy. The plan will reduce
the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent,
while also ending the alternative minimum
tax credit. Our country currently has six dif-
ferent federal tax brackets, and the proposed
plan would reduce those groupings to just
two brackets with rates of 10 and 25 percent.
These tax reforms are expected to raise $2.73
trillion in tax revenue in 2013. If the taxes for
the wealthy are being cut, it's the middle and
lower class individuals who will pay the high
price for this revenue, even though they're in
the worst position to pay the extra taxes.
A new budget plan needs to be created, but
not one that has the potential to hurt millions
of middle and lower class Americans. Repub-
licans and Democrats need to craft a legiti-
mate proposal that would appease both sides
instead of creating partisan budgets.

am blessed. Blessed to be here
writingthis article. To go to this
University. To get an education.
I'm blessed that
I grew up in a
household where
going to college
was not only a
priority, but also
a financially via-
ble option - an
option actually
had the means HARSHA
and resources to NAHATA
pursue.
Last Tuesday,
the Coalition for Tuition Equality
held a forum. Being unfamiliar with
the CTE, I thought I'd check it out,
and I left amazed at what I heard
and what I learned.
The CTE is behind a push to
have the University charge undocu-
mented students who are Michigan
residents in-state tuition. For many,
college is already expensive, and
having to pay out-of-state tuition
only makes it further out of reach.
What impacted me the most from
the forum was how prevalent inac-
cessibility to college was and what
it truly meant. Beyond the statistics
and rhetorical political speeches
surrounding higher education is the
reality of not being able to attend
college. It seems obvious, but what
it means to not be able to go to col-
lege finally hit me.
We all grow up dreaming of what
we want to be when we're older -
whether it's a doctor, a teacher or
an astronaut. From then on, every-
thing we do, in some way, works
toward that dream. We go to school
and work hard so we can go to col-
lege. We go to college so we can get
jobs. In today's economy and job
market, not having a college degree
means not being able to fulfill those
childhood dreams. It means not
having a career or a final goal to
work towards. It means not being
able to dream.
And it's not just undocumented
immigrants that are struggling.
While they are at the forefront of
this issue, college accessibility is
important to a wide group of indi-
viduals. It affects the veteran from

Michigan who, because of his over-
seas service, is now forced to pay
out-of-state tuition, though he grew
up in the state. It affects the child
of an immigrant here on a work
visa - fully documented - who
has lived here all of his or her life,
but because he or she doesn't have
a green card, the child still pays
out-of-state tuition. It affects those
fromlow-income backgrounds who,
even though they're in-state, can't
afford the rising costs of tuition.
Many will argue that there are
scholarships, federal programs and
financial aid in place to take care
of cases like this. But, it's nowhere
near enough. College costs are so
high that the current national aver-
age for one year of study at a public
university is $16,410. For private
colleges, this number is more than
doubled, reaching $37,000. And the
effects of this are showing. Stud-
ies show that only 10 percent of
freshmen entering high school go
straight to college and graduate
with a degree before the age of 24.
The Brookings Institution found
that 79 percent of students in the
highest income bracket go to col-
lege, while only 34 percent in the
lowest income bracket attend. The
divide is growing, and it's growing
purely along economic and finan-
cial lines.
With the unemployment rate
almost twice as high among those
without a college degree, it's easy to
conclude that college is essential in
order to get a job. Without college,
students not only lose the possibil-
ity of getting an education, but they
also lose the prospects of having a
sustainable career. The economic
environment today dictates that
without a college degree, it's nearly
impossible to have a solid future.
And the problem is that if kids
don't have a future to look forward
to, they will soon lose motivation to
perform. What's the point of work-
ing tirelessly throughout middle
school and high school if there is no
reward or point to your effort? In a
culture in which so much of what
students do is geared toward getting
into college, not having this option
takes away motivation to work.

In the discussion following the
CTE panel, LSA freshman Xochitl
Calix-Ulloa, brought up a good
point. She came from a high school
where many students were undoc-
umented, and she reiterated that
going back, she has found that many
of the older kids are apathetic to
school. Not because they're stupid
or lazy, but because they have no
option beyond high school anyway,
and thus, no reason to work toward
anything.
Too many people
are unable to
afford college.

The more inaccessible college
becomes, the more it validates this
mindset and apathy in students.
What is the point of working hard in
school when you know that your fate
has been decided for you, when you
know that you won't be able to go
anywhere after you earn your diplo-
ma? College is a way to fulfill your
career goals and dreams. Taking
away that resource, for many, takes
away the ability to work toward
those goals. And that is where the
true failure of our public education
system lies.
College accessibility isn't just
about finding a way for kids to go to
college. Every conversation about
improving K-12 student achieve-
ment, about decreasing unemploy-
ment rates, about income inequality
and improving low-income quality
of life begins with college accessi-
bility. America is a nation of dream-
ers - after all, the staple of success
here is achieving the American
Dream. When our social and politi-
cal structure is set up in a way that
snatches this very dream from chil-
dren, it's needless to say that some-
thing isn't being done right.

DENARD ROBINSON AND ADITYA SATH I W
An avenue for change in Detroit

Since 1994, the Violence Against Women Act
has been reauthorized by Congress without too
many hitches. The act has historically fund-
ed investigations into violent crimes against
women. However, this time, the act arrived
in the Senate with a less unified vote between
both parties. Republicans and Democrats have
rewritten their own versions of the act to be
considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
After reviewing both versions of the act, the
committee voted on party lines for their respec-
tive versions of the bill. A decision has still not
been reached about the renewal of the act.
The existing act has three parts with which
Republicans do not agree.
The first gives Native-American tribal
courts jurisdiction over non-tribe members
who have committed crimes of domestic abuse
against Native Americans. Supporters of the
bill describe the Republicans' rationale asbeing
similar to saying that a woman who is abused
in Michigan by someone from Ohio could not
appeal to courts in Michigan.
Next, Republicans have qualms with the
wording on LGBTQ rights. The bill, as it is writ-
ten now, says organizations that receive federal
grant funding should not discriminate against
anyone on the grounds of sexual orientation.
While Senate Republicans say they agree with
this statement, they do not think that it needs to
be written into the bill.
The third reason for Republican aversion to
the bill is the stipulation for immigrants. Cur-
rently, the bill states that undocumented vic-
tims of domestic abuse can apply for a visa to
obtain legal status. Having this status allows
victims to work in the United States, becom-
ing independent of their abuser. In the past two
years, the Obama administration has met the

limit of 10,000 visas per year, which shows the
effectiveness of the act to give victims opportu-
nity and a chance at survival.
Over spring break, I had the opportunity to
travel to San Juan, Texas and visit many dif-
ferent community grassroots organizations
that campaign for immigrants' rights. One
of the agencies I visited was the South Texas
Civil Rights Project. Their mission is to pro-
mote social, economic and racial equality in
educational and social services for those who
are least able to defend themselves. The South
Texas Civil Rights Project conducts much of its
work through the VAWA.
While in San Juan, I heard the stories of
women who had survived horrible, life-threat-
ening situations because of the VAWA. I heard
testimonies from women who had been physi-
cally or sexually abused, or who had experi-
enced human trafficking. With the VAWA,
these women were able to seek the legal help
they needed to become legal residents, with-
out the knowledge or approval of their abusers.
The South Texas Civil Rights Project, just one
of many organizations of its kind, has helped
hundreds of women to seek the assistance they
needed to escape an abusive relationship.
The VAWA is still under debate for reautho-
rization. However, if Senate Republicans strike
down the bill, thousands of victims of domes-
tic violence each year will continue to suffer in
their current state. It's important for this bill
to be passed to ensure continuous protection
of the women who need help the most. While
these women may not have the voice to defend
themselves, it's necessary for those of us with a
voice to show our support for the VAWA.

How many times have you heard people complain
about the socioeconomic state of Detroit? How many
times have you heard people propose ideas to revital-
ize the city, but never take action on these ideas? The
Detroit Action Commonwealth is not just an organiza-
tion that talks the talk - it's an organization that has
made significant positive change in the lives of many.
The DAC is a non-partisan, non-profit organization
that has chapters located at the Capuchin Soup Kitch-
ens in Detroit. The purpose of this organization, as
taken from its website, is "to organize poor and home-
less persons and families, provide opportunities and
workshops to help them improve their lives, develop
leadership capacities, advocate for better and more
humane services, and educate and mobilize around
issues of social and economic justice."
You might ask, "What has the DAC accomplished
in the past to make it a legitimate organization?" The
short answer to this question is that it has worked on
issues related to employment, neighborhood safety,
shelters and housing and voter registration, just to
name a few. To elaborate on some of these issues, the
DAC has worked to get community members a form of
state identification. Having a state ID is the first step
to receiving state assistance and potentially finding a
form of employment. The organization also met with
Melvin Gupton, the director of Work Force Develop-
ment in the City of Detroit, and helped 25 young people
on the city's east side find work. In terms of safety, the
DAC has gotten the city of Detroit to commit to tear-
ing down a list of 40 burned and dilapidated houses

on Detroit's east side. A list of even more accomplish-
ments made by the DAC can be found on tubmanorga-
nizing.org under their affiliates.
As for housing, the leaders of the DAC have worked
with the landlords of various shelters to ensure that the
establishment is accountable for proper facilities and the
cleanup of bed bugs. The organization also emphasizes
the importance of civic participation by registering an
average of 30 members a month to vote. These are just a
few of the many accomplishments that have come from
the work of the DAC over the course of the last few years.
If you want to make a positive difference in the
world, then I suggest that you support the DAC - there
are many ways that you can do so. If you are interested
in learning about organizingthe DAC, then take Politi-
cal Science 389: Theory and the Practice of Communi-
ty Organizing with Prof. Gregory Markus. On campus,
you have the option of joining the student organization
Students for the Detroit Action Commonwealth to help
organize workshops, hold fundraisers and educate
students about the work of the commonwealth. At the
very least, take a second and show your support for the
organization by liking their Facebook page at www.
facebook.com/DetroitActionCommonwealth.
It's not often that you come across a strong avenue
for positive socioeconomic change, but if you have read
this viewpoint, then it's safe to say that you just did.
Find a way to contribute to the DAC so that you, too,
can make a difference.

Nicki balances pop
and rap on latest
release
By GREGORY HICKS
Daily Arts Writer
Nicki Minaj is the biggest hyp-
ocrite and conformist the music
industry has seen in years. She
raps about how
'cause (she's)
still hood,
Hollywood Nicki Minaj
couldn't change
(her)." Wrong. Pink Friday:
Once you Roman
realize RedOne Reloaded
produced
nearly a third Young Money
of her newest
album and two other songs were
produced by Dr. Luke, too many
other pop artists come to mind.
Jennifer Lopez, Lady Gaga and
Katy Perry are just a few of the
acts who abuse the popularity
of these writer-producers to no
end - and clearly it works out for
them.
Promotion for this album
began with a rocky start, to say
the least. The first song released
to promote the album, "Roman In
Moscow," doesn't even appear on

the official track list (coinciden-
tally, it wasn't very popular).
The second attempt to build
up the album, "Stupid Hoe," was
a song and video with negative
feedback rivaled only by Rebecca
Black herself. This cleverly titled
masterpiece left many fans with
doubts regarding the quality of
the upcoming album. And let's
not even discuss that atrocious
excuse for a Grammy perfor-
mance.
Even with all this being said,
this album is one of the best
albums that has been released
this year, if not the past few
years. It incorporates everything:
the rap, the pop, the dubstep, the
collaborations with other famous
artists and the image.
Minaj's embarrassingly silly
alter ego actually does the album
a lot of favors. Its rap-heavy half
pleases all the Young Money fans,
while the pop-heavy half is music
to the ears of the electronic main-
stream crowd.
And luckily for Minaj, RedOne
seems to have put a great deal
of effort toward incorporating a
new dubstep sound into his pro-
duction, not previously typical of
his work. Given the lasting suc-
cess of the album's first official
single, "Starships," this touch
appears to be working.

In songs like "Automatic," the
up-tempo melodic catchiness
can't be denied - complemented
with a creative hint of dubstep
like most other tracks on this half
of the album - but the presence
of the artist leaves little to be
desired. The nearly complete lack
of rap in the song might be cross-
ing a little too far into pop terri-
tory for Minaj.
Logically speaking, the album
should be a two-disk record with
one side containing the nutcase
personality and the other con-
taining the conformist, but Minaj
would be under heavy fire for
pulling an IAm...Sasha Fierce.
Speaking of album titles, this
is another aspect of the work that
is a tad confusing. Understand-
ably, rappers enjoy having some
chronology to their albums (e.g.
The Carter albums), but Pink Fri-
day: Roman Reloaded sounds like
a rereleased version of Minaj's
debut album Pink Friday. And
with good reason, seeing as that's
what Rihanna's Good Girl Gone
Bad:Reloaded was.
Up until the release of "Star-
ships," Nicki Minaj has continu-
ally made a fool of herself and a
fool of her work. With any luck, a
few spoiled tracks in combination
with Minaj's antics won't stop the
album from shining through.

"Sweetness & Sickness" marks
the end of I Love You, It's Cool,
resulting in a mix of conflicted
emotions. The longest and least-
enthusiastic song off the album
manages to be the most alluring
and memorable, while so many
of the previous hook-enhanced
tracks are just vague indie-pop
memories. I Love You, It's Cool is
definitely a record worth being

more in love with the music than
you are.

The trend of fauna-inspired
band names is spiraling out of
control. Don't believe me?
Grizzly Bear. Panda Bear.
Minus the Bear. Polar Bear. Bear
in Heaven. Bear vs. Shark. And
those are just some of the band
names with the word "bear" in
them - what's the D with the
animal kingdom being so over-
represented in music these days?
The two aren't exactly an inher-
ent pair. Why not something else
equally random like tree names or
the elements of the periodic table?
I have nothing against ani-
mals - who does? The problem
is that the industry has latched
onto an idea that's gone overkill.
A band name can be centered on
anything. Whyso many about ani-
mals?
The fad is relativelyrecent, hav-
ing started with misspelled riffs
on animals such as The Beatles
and The Monkees, but it's grown
increasingly trendy as of late. In
fact, the Internet is littered with
websites listing the scores of ani-
mal-related band names.

BASEBALL PREVIEW .
Big Ten preview:
Can 'M' rise in'12?

A look back at Wolverine hoops

By GLENN MILLER JR.
Daily Sports Writer
2011 was rough for Big Ten
baseball. Other than Illinois' auto-
matic conference bid to the NCAA
tournament, the conference failed
for the second year in a row to
qualify any other teams. One of
the nation's most prestigious con-
ferences continued to sink into the
depths of the college baseballhier-
archy, succumbing to the beasts of
the SEC and ACC.
But that was 2011. Things have
changed, and the future of base-
ball in the Big Ten is a favorable
one. The question now ishowlong
will we have to wait for this new
era to reveal itself?
There's a different feeling to
this season. A mild winter has let
the grass grow a little greener,
the sun shine a little brighter and
the aura of change to feel a little
stronger. Purdue is as strong as
ever, Michigan State has the talent
to take home another conference
title and Nebraska is looking to
make its mark on the Big Ten. But
will it all be enough? The ques-
tions still remain. Who will capi-
talize on the opportunity in 2012?
Will Nebraska prove it's the new
sheriff in town? Can Michigan
prove its finish at the bottom of
the standings last year was merely
a fluke?
We will answer these questions
and more as we highlight this
year's contenders and pretenders
in our Big Ten preview.
NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK
In their first year as a member
of the Big Ten, the Cornhuskers
are well aware of their percep-
tion in the conference. They're the
new kids on the block and haven't
made the time to formally intro-
duce themselves to their suburbia
neighbors. Rather than bringing
by some baked goods as a courte-
ous gesture, Nebraska will try to
prove it's here to stay by taking
home the Big Ten championship
in 2012.
Former Husker and ex-major
leaguer Darin Erstad takes over as
the new commander-in-chief for
Nebraska, replacing veteran Mike
Anderson after last year's embar-
rassing3-8 May record.With eight
returning starters, Erstad will rely
on an experienced Cornhusker
squad to improve on last season's
.270 team batting average. Junior
outfielder Chad Christensen
should emerge as one of the team's
top offensive threats, backed up by
the big bat of sophomore outfield-
er Michael Pritchard. Sophomore
left-handed pitcher Zach Hirsch
will be an ace on the mound, while
sophomore right-hander Brandon
Pierce will be one of the confer-
ence's top closers.
SPARTY ON
Michigan State will be back
with a vengeance in 2012 after
being snubbed of an at-large bid
for last season's NCAA Tourna-
ment. After tallying its second-
consecutive 30-win season, the
Spartans split the 2011 Big Ten
title with Illinois. The confer-
ence's best-hitting team will have
to maintain its momentum late
into the season, though, as a late
collapse cost the team an opportu-
nity to win the title outright.
Though the majority of Michi-
gan State's roster will return, the

Spartans must recover from a few
key losses on the mound and at the
plate. Big Ten batting champion
Brandon Eckerle and the reign-

ing Big Ten Player of the Year first
basemen Jeff Holm, were both
drafted by the Detroit Tigers.
Senior right-hander Tony Bucci-
ferro will be one of the Big Ten's
premier stars, listed as the 34th-
best player in College Baseball
Daily's 2012 Top 100 Player Count-
down. The Spartans won't have
the opportunity to play Nebraska
this year, but their pre-conference
success should be deserving of a
postseason bid.
PUR-DOING IT RIGHT
Some would say Purdue's
37-win season last year may be the
Boilermakers' pinnacle mark. As
the team moves into its new home
at the state-of-the-art Northwest
Complex this spring, Purdue
believes it can keep the fire stoked
in 2012. The only Big Ten team
currently ranked in the nation's
top 25, the Boilermakers are
returning an experienced team
that has arguably the best infield
in the conference. If Purdue can
reproduce last season's .309 bat-
ting average and .967 fielding per-
centage, this may be the team's
year to make a deep postseason
run.
Purdue's only weakness may
be the lack of depth of its pitching
rotation. In addition to losing ace
Matt Morgan to the major leagues,
right-hander Brad Schrieber will
miss the majority of the season
while recovering from Tommy
John surgery. The Boilermak-
ers will rely on their workhorse,
senior right-handed pitcher Lance
Breedlove, who leads the Big Ten
in strikeouts thus far. For offen-
sive production, Purdue will turn
to fifth-year senior infielder Eric
Charles and junior catcher Kevin
Plawecki. Despite a challeng-
ing non-conference schedule, the
Boilermakers currently hold the
best overall record in the Big Ten.
BLUE TIMES IN ANN ARBOR
If there's one team in the Big
Ten that has something to prove,
it's Rich Maloney's Michigan
squad. The Wolverines finished
last in the conference a year ago at
7-16. After struggling early in the
season, Michigan's losing streak
seemed to simply snowball before
the team could diagnose its issues.
A year later, the same team that
was battered and bruised at the
bottom of the Big Ten barrel is
looking to "flip it" by capturing a
Big Ten championship this season.
But it will take a lot more than
just words and motivation. The
Wolverines need improvement
in both their lineup and bullpen,
looking to improve on a confer-
ence-worst 5.09 ERA and .245
batting average. Junior outfielder
Patrick Biondi has been exception-
al for Michigan thus far and will
be the rock of this season's lineup.
Look for freshman outfielder Will
Drake to emerge as one of the
Wolverines' top performers, along
with the consistent bat of sopho-
more outfielder Michael O'Neill.
Michigan's bullpen still lacks
reliable relief pitching, an area
the Wolverines must continue to
develop in Big Ten play. The start-
ing rotation, headlined by junior
right-hander Ben Ballantine, has
shown glimpses of dominance
early this year but has struggled
of late with its inability to shut
down opposing lineups. The Wol-
verines have the talent to compete

with the conference's giants, but
they need to execute in big games
if they hope to change the fate of
baseball in Ann Arbor.

Michigan coach John Beilein's fifth season-saw mostly positive results despite an early exit in Michigan's first game in the NCAA Tournament in Nashville, Tenn.

ByNEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
Tears have dried, and brackets
have been sworn at, crumpled and
thrown into bodies of water. It's
been more than two weeks since
the Michigan men's basketball
team was stunned by Ohio in the
second (really, the first) round of
the NCAA Tournament, and now,
with the tournament over, we can
take a step back.
Norfolk State captured our
hearts,broke them, un-broke them
and re-broke them. So did Wiscon-
sin. So did Gus Johnson, after it
was determined that he wouldn't
be callingthis year's tournament.
Enough of the shock has worn
off, and Michigan fans can take
solace that the Wolverines beat
the only team that beat the nation-
al champions. We've regained our
composure and are now able to get
back on the podium and pass down
judgment for the Wolverines' 2011-
12 campaign.
How did Michigan do this year?
Tough question.
If you were told at the start of
the season that Michigan would
beat Michigan State, Ohio State
and Wisconsin, win all but one
home game and bring home its
first Big Ten Championship in 26
years, it'd be an easy answer. The
Wolverines met, exceeded and
jumped giddily on top of their pre-
season expectations.
But what people cared about
was whether Michigan would
improve upon last season's
third-round NCAA Tournament
appearance. That didn't happen,
so it's easy to say the Wolverines
fell short of their goals.
However, what the team did in
one game against an unfamiliar
opponent in an unfamiliar city
shouldn't negatively color percep-
tions of Michigan's season as a
whole. It was clear that the pro-
gram made big strides in becom-
ing a Big Ten powerhouse, earning
a four-seed in the Big Dance on the

Grade: A-
Best Game
Feb. 18 wasn't just a dreary Sat-
urday a week before my half-birth-
day. It was a day-long Michigan
basketball holiday. The festivities
began at 5 a.m. with Michigan
coach John Beilein passing out
donuts to the Maize Rage, con-
tinued with College Gameday in
Crisler Center in the morning and
lasted deep into the night.
It didn't hurt that the Wolver-
ines also took down then-No. 6
Ohio State, 56-51, behind fresh-
man point guard Trey Burke's 17
points, vaulting Michigan into Big
Ten title contention.
Michigan's big men stood up
to the Buckeyes' dominant front-
court, and the team proved that it
could compete with and actually
beat the top teams in the country.
Worst Game
A week after the win over the
Buckeyes, Michigan took the court
for senior night (on my half-birth-
day), and it couldn't have gone any
worse. No Wolverine topped 12
points, and Michigan put forth its
worst defensive effort of the sea-
son, allowing Purdue to shoot 50
percent and dominate the second
half in a 75-61 blowout loss.
Not only did the game send
seniors Zack Novak and Stu Dou-
glass out of Crisler Center with
a frownie face, but at the time, it
appeared as though Michigan had
squandered its chances at a con-
ference title.
Best Moment
With Michigan huddled around
the 84-inch television screen
in the video room of the Player
Development Center, Ohio State
guard William Buford grabbed
a handoff from Aaron Craft and
took two dribbles toward the top
of the key. As he drifted left and
released a high-arcing jumper
over Michigan State guard Keith
Appling, the Wolverines' hopes
for a conference title were up in
the air. A Buckeye victory would
give the Spartans their fifth con-
ference loss and there would be
a three-way tie for the Big Ten

Championship.
Buford's shot found nothing but
net, and Michigan celebrated its
first conference title since 1986.
Worst Moment
In Michigan's second-round
game against 13-seed Ohio in the
NCAA Tournament, the Wolver-
ines found themselves down three
points with a few minutes to go.
The fourth-seeded Wolverines
had been down nearly the whole
game, but in the past few min-
utes, Burke had scored 12 straight
points and reduced a nine-point
Michigan deficit to three.
Burke then missed three
3-point attempts in the final
minutes, but it still wasn't over.
Michigan corralled an offensive
rebound, and sophomore forward
Evan Smotrycz wound up with
the ball, ready to reset the offense
with seven seconds left.
Smotrycz tried a left-to-right
crossover and botched it. The
Bobcats gained possession, made
their free throws and sent Michi-
gan home early. It would also be
Smotrycz's last - and lasting -
play as a Wolverine. The Reading,
Mass. native has left the program
and is seeking a new school.
Biggest Surprise
No surprise here. Actually, big
surprise. No surprise that Burke
was the biggest surprise this sea-
son.
After Darius Morris left Ann
Arbor early for the NBA, it wasn't
clear how Michigan would fill a
void of 15 points, seven assists and
four rebounds per game. Even in
the week leading up to the sea-
son, Beilein was non-committal
about his new floor leader. Burke,
Douglass and freshman Carlton
Brundidge were all offered as pos-
sibilities.
But after the first games, it was
clear that Burke was the guy. He

had better quickness than Morris,
was a better shooter, possessed a
more controlled dribble and was
less goofy-looking. Burke proved
to be the Wolverines' best player
and became the go-to scoring
option in the clutch. He scintillat-
ed fans all season long with crafty
spins, acrobatic layups and assas-
sin-like shots from deep.
He led the team in points (14.8
per game), assists, steals and
even blocks, but questions linger
about his future with the team.
His father, Benji, said that Trey
was considering declaring for the
NBA draft, and Michigan fans will
anxiously await Burke's decision
before the April29 deadline.
Biggest Disappointment
After his breakout freshman
season, Tim Hardaway Jr. looked
to improve his sophomore year
and establish his status as the
team's star.
But questionable shot selection,
emotional outbursts on the court
and an apparent lack of confidence
hampered Hardaway Jr. for much
of the season. Though his scor-
ing average increased from 13.9 to
14.6, all of his shooting averages
fell, his turnovers increased by
nearly 50 percent and his steals fell
by over 100 percent.
Hardaway Jr. did have a few
games where he showed he can
be the dominant swingman that
many thought he could be - which
included two double-doubles and
two 25-plus-point outbursts - but
frustration was the theme of the
season for the sophomore.
One-sentencereview/preview
Michigan made significant
strides in re-establishing itself as
a brand name in college basketball
this season, but it remains to be
seen whether Beilein can main-
tain success through consecutive
recruiting classes.

hovered above .300 but has since
cooled off.
Second base
Maloney had a big void to fill when
Anthony Toth graduated after last
season, and he has yet to find a per-
manent replacement. Though there
are three candidates that rotate at
second base - redshirt sophomore
John DiLaura, freshman Eric Jacob-
son and redshirt junior Kevin Krantz
- no one has earned the official ros-
ter label.
DiLaura seems to be the top con-
tender, but his declining batting aver-
age may get him bumped from the
leading role.
DiLaura accumulated a promis-
ing .600 batting average and .600 on
base percentage in his first handful of
at-bats. But in the last 11 games, he's
gone 4-for-29, which may be enough
for Maloney to pull the plug.
Third base
After spending a summer in the
Arizona Collegiate Wood-Bat League,
senior co-captain John Lorenz looked
refreshed and fit for the season ahead.
He has met fielding expectations
and he's been a semi-dependable hit-
ter - he just hasn't had many stellar
at-bats. Though Lorenz posted five
RBIs against West Virginia, he went
11 straight games without batting-in
a runner.
Shortstop
Junior Derek Dennis was recruit-
ed as the 10th-best shortstop in the
country coming out of high school.
Though the ranking seemed promis-
ing, Dennis was unavailable for three
weeks of conference play last year
after an ankle injury.
Dennis played in the firstsix games

this season but is not expected to
return to his original post until May
because of a thumb injury. He's now
making sporadic appearances as a
pinch runner, cast and all.
Freshman Dylan Delaney has
played in Dennis' absence and has
started consistently, even with a mea-
sly .182 batting average.
Right field
Sophomore Michael O'Neill had a
veteran-like year in his first season
with Michigan and continues to set
the bar high. His skill level gave the
Wolverines an extra edge at the plate,
and he has yet to disappoint.
O'Neill leads the team with 37
hits, nine doubles and six home runs.
Though he recorded multiple hits in
10 of the first 12 outings this season,
his hot hitting has been fading little
by little.
Center field
The leadoff hitter, junior co-
captain Patrick Biondi, has recently
excelled at the plate. He's fulfilled his
role getting on base with ease and fre-
quency, and he leads the team with a
.466 on-base percentage.
Before the Minnesota series, Biondi
boasted an eight-game hitting streak,
including five multi-hit games. His
batting average has jumped from .214
to .327 in less than a month.
Biondi has an almost-perfect .987
fielding percentage, with only one
error this season. He's started every
game between O'Neill and freshman
Will Drake in the outfield, except
against Chicago State, when he
experimented at second base.
Adding to Biondi's bragging rights
are his conference-leading 17 stolen
bases, as he climbs Michigan's career
stolen-base list. One more will tie him

for second place all-time with Jim
Durham (1986-89) at 74.
Left field
In his rookie campaign, Will Drake
has proven his worth to the team. He
holds much promise in Michigan's
rebuilding year with a .333 batting
average and .405 on-base percentage.
Drake has been the only Wolver-
ine to start every game this season in
the same position. And his consistent
spot in the batting order, following
Biondi, shows the left-handed hitter's
value.
He is tied for sixth in the nation
with four triples this season and
added to the one-two punch that
Biondi and O'Neillpacked last season.
Catcher
It's been a split between Coley
Crank and sophomore Cole Martin
crouching behind home plate.
Crank divides his time between
catcher and designated hitter, and
even though his batting average has
sunk below .20q, he produces during
crunch time. He's tallied 20 RBIs and
five home runs this season en route
to oth-place on Michigan's career
home runs list with 28.
Martin's results at bat (.246)
haven't impressed anyone, but him
learning under Crank will be a long-
term advantage.
Starting pitching
Michigan has three potential aces
in the running - senior right-hander
Brandon Sinnery, junior right-hander
Ben Ballantine and redshirt junior
left-hander Bobby Brosnahan.
The trio of hurlers has shown'
major signs of improvement from last
season, which could be credited to
the new pitching coach, Steve Mer-

riman.
Before the Minnesota series, each
had recorded at least 34 innings on
the mound. Brosnahan posted a 2.10
ERA, Ballantine had tallied 29 strike-
outs and Sinnery had been reliable
but lagged behind a bit. Maloney did
not see weekend starters as an area of
concern.
But in the first bit of conference
action, the pitching staff dropped
the ball. Against the Golden Gophers,
Sinnery gave up six runs and Ballan-
tine and Brosnahan were pulled early
after poor performances.
Brosnahan allowed 10 hits and
eight earned runs in just 1.1 innings of
work. To put that into perspective, he
had given up just eight earned runs in
his first five starts this season.
Michigan will face have scant
pitching options if this becomes a
regular occurrence against Big Ten
bats.
Relief pitching
Maloney has been experimenting
all season to find steady relief pitch-
ers. Though he has a few in mind, no
one has stepped-up to claim a perma-
nent spot.
Young pitchers, freshman right-
hander Matt Ogden and left-hander
Trent Szkutnik, have the potential to
succeed.
In Ogden's last 8.1 innings on the
mound, he has allowed only one
earned run. And Szkutnik threw 11
scoreless innings and notched eight
strikeouts over his last three appear-
ances.
Since the start of the season, Malo-
ney has kept a close eye on the two
rookies and waited to reap the bene-
fits. This is the perfect time for Szkut-
nik and Ogden to pull away from the
mediocrity in the bullpen.

On Baseball: It's time to flip the switch

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
"Flip it."
That was the motto for the
season. "From worst to first,"
the Michigan baseball team
proclaimed at "Meet the Wol-
verines" night on February 15 -
and the players meant it.
On that night, the Wolverines
were adamant that this season

would be different. They talked
about how last year was a fluke
and how they were certainly not
as bad as their 17-37 record indi-
cated. They set out to prove that
this was no 2011 and that their
tenure as the worst team in the
conference was over.
And through the first week or
so of the 2012 schedule, Michi-
gan did look like a changed
team. It opened up the season

5-2 behind a red-hot lineup and
great starting pitching.
But then the Wolverines
began to struggle, and the los-
ing snowballed. All of a sud-
den the 2011 version showed
up - the offense couldn't hit
and the bullpen fizzled in the
late innings. At one point, the
Wolverines lost seven of eight
games, including five in a row.
And as they scratched and

clawed to a 12-13 nonconfer-
ence record, they offered up
phrases like, "it's all about pre-
paring so we can play our best
baseball entering the Big Ten
season" and "as long as we can
pick it up during Big Ten play,
we'll be okay." For them, it's
been about the Big Ten season
from day one.
Well now it's come time for
the Wolverines to make good

on their bold preseason predic-
tion, to finish what they set out
to accomplish: collect a 36th Big
Ten Championship.
But if they're serious about
achieving that goal, they'll need
to improve - and do it fast.
It's time for the offense to
show us that the lineup doesn't
just consist of Patrick Bion-
di, Will Drake and Michael
O'Neill.
At least one of the three out-
fielders leads the team in every
major offensive statistical cat-
egory, and in many categories,
they rank as the top three. Brett
Winger, Coley Crank, John
Lorenz, Dylan Delany and Cole
Martin have slumped terribly
since the first two weeks of the
season, and none are batting
above .265. -
It's time for them to prove
that they can score runs consis-
tently, or at least put the bat on
the ball - the team entered Big
Ten play ranked first with 200
strikeouts.
And it's time for the pitch-
ing staff to show us that it can
be elite and that it can get a
strikeout when it needs one - it
ranked eighth in the conference
with 142 strikeouts before Big
Ten play started. It's time for
the erratic hurlers to show us
that they can take care of their
control issues and limit their
"freebies."
The pitching staff ranked
first in walks given up and wild

pitches, with 98 and 30, respec-
tively. They also ranked second
with 30 hit batsmen. It's time
for the relievers to show us that
they can be a reliable bunch and
close out games on a consistent
basis, and that someone can step
up and take control of the late
innings. Five different relievers
have recorded at least one save.
The Wolverines don't need to
finish first in the Big Ten, they
just need to improve enough to
finish in the top-six of the con-
ference. If they can make the
Big Ten Tournament, they will
give themselves an opportunity
to steal the Big Ten's automatic
invitation to the NCAA Tour-
nament by winning the confer-
ence's postseason tournament.
So if the Wolverines want
to play their way into a NCAA
Tournament berth, this motto
can't just be some motivational
tactic.
It needs to be a necessity for
them because it's unlikely that
there will be another route to
the NCAA's.
The Big Ten offers up a
chance for a clean slate.
So forget about the five-game
slide in early March and the
current sub-.500 record. The
slumping lineup, the inconsis-
tent bullpen, the erratic pitch-
ing - it all needs to be left in the
past.
Mycalendar says it's not 2011
anymore. It's time for Michigan
to start playing like it.
